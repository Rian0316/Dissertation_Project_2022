ADULT SHELDON:
My father took pride in saying

17
00:00:29,578 --> 00:00:31,879
that he ran our house
like a tight ship.

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,382
The ship got a lot looser when

19
00:00:34,383 --> 00:00:37,051
my meemaw came over
to babysit.
(firecracker pops)

20
00:00:37,052 --> 00:00:40,588
I bet a nickel.

21
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,623
Hang on there a minute,
moon pie.

22
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,459
I want to teach
you somethin'.

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,626
Look at your cards,

24
00:00:45,627 --> 00:00:47,462
and then look
in the mirror.

25
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:49,263
Hey, I'm smiling.

26
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:50,298
(firecracker pops)
Uh-huh.

27
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,299
And what does that

28
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,401
tell me about your cards?

29
00:00:53,402 --> 00:00:54,769
That I like them?

30
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,471
Attaboy. Now...

31
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,272
look at my face.

32
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,607
(firecracker pops)
Tell me

33
00:00:59,608 --> 00:01:01,142
what you see.

34
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,310
That you're old.

35
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,545
It's a good thing I love you.

36
00:01:04,546 --> 00:01:06,849
(firecracker pops)
I'm gonna look at
my cards again.

37
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,184
You're unhappy.

38
00:01:10,185 --> 00:01:11,719
Which means...?

39
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,287
You don't have good cards.

40
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:14,490
Mm-hmm.
(firecracker pops)

41
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:16,758
So...

42
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:19,393
I'm gonna see
your nickel...

43
00:01:19,394 --> 00:01:21,796
and raise you
a quarter.
Quarter?

44
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,397
You can fold.

45
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:26,467
No. I have good cards;
you have bad cards.

46
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:27,902
I'm in.

47
00:01:27,903 --> 00:01:30,471
Nines and fives.
Mm.

48
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:32,740
That's too bad.

49
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:34,909
Three queens. You lose!

50
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,511
(laughing)
What?

51
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,079
But you weren't happy.

52
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,381
I made youthink
I was unhappy.
But that's lying.

53
00:01:40,382 --> 00:01:42,817
You lied to your moon pie.

54
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:44,853
I bluffed my moon pie.

55
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,390
Do people know about this?
Sheldon,

56
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,792
what's on a person's face

57
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:53,561
is not always
what's in their heart.

58
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:55,296
Well, this changes everything.

59
00:01:55,297 --> 00:01:57,331
How do you know who to trust?

60
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,499
You don't.

61
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,803
That's what makes life
interesting.

62
00:02:01,804 --> 00:02:05,106
ADULT SHELDON:
Meemaw liked to teach me things
that kept me awake at night.

63
00:02:05,107 --> 00:02:06,440
MARY:
Mom, we're home!

64
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:08,142
In here!

65
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:09,710
What's he doing up?

66
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,012
Losin'.

67
00:02:11,013 --> 00:02:12,346
(firecracker pops)

68
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:13,714
Hell is that?

69
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,383
I sent Georgie
on a beer run,

70
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,618
and tipped him
with firecrackers.

71
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,820
Oh, Mom.

72
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,421
(door opens)
Was I supposed to stiff him?

73
00:02:20,422 --> 00:02:21,422
(door closes)

74
00:02:21,423 --> 00:02:24,860
I ate so much candy!

75
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,629
Okay.

76
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,431
They're all yours.

77
00:02:30,432 --> 00:02:32,066

00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,634

85
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:56,920
Sometimes people say to me,
"Pastor Jeff,

86
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,755
how do you know there's a God?"

87
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,825
And I say, "It's simple math.

88
00:03:01,826 --> 00:03:04,294
God either exists
or he doesn't."

89
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,963
(chuckles):
So let's be cynical.

90
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:08,966
Worst-case scenario,
there's a 50-50 chance.

91
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,034
And I like those odds.

92
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:12,603
That's wrong.

93
00:03:12,604 --> 00:03:14,705
Shelly,
put your hand down.

94
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:16,073
Sorry. Please continue.

It's okay, Mary.

00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:19,676
I-It's Sheldon, right?

97
00:03:19,677 --> 00:03:21,712
Yes, sir.
Well, Sheldon,

98
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:24,281
why don't you come on up here
and tell me how I'm wrong.

99
00:03:24,282 --> 00:03:25,782
No.
Okay.

100
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:28,085
(chuckles) Let's give him
a hand, everybody.

101
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,922
Mm. What's happening?

102
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,263
Shelly's gonna eat him
alive. (chuckles)

103
00:03:39,264 --> 00:03:40,664
PASTOR JEFF:
So...

104
00:03:40,665 --> 00:03:42,032
you were saying?

105
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:45,202
You've confused possibilities
with probabilities.

106
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:46,937
According to your analogy,
when I go home

107
00:03:46,938 --> 00:03:49,840
I might find a million dollars
on my bed or I might not.

108
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,175
In what universe
is that 50-50?

109
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,343
(congregation murmuring)

110
00:03:53,344 --> 00:03:54,811
PASTOR JEFF:
So what do you think

111
00:03:54,812 --> 00:03:57,047
the odds are
that God exists?

112
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:58,715
I think they're zero.

113
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,584
I believe in science.

114
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:01,752
(congregation ooh'ing,
murmuring)

115
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:03,086
PASTOR JEFF:
So you don't think

116
00:04:03,087 --> 00:04:05,822
science and religion
can go hand in hand?

117
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,592
Science is facts,
religion is faith.

118
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,460
I prefer facts.
Mm.

119
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,095
I understand that.

120
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:13,764
Here's a cool fact for ya.

121
00:04:13,765 --> 00:04:15,432
A lot of famous scientists

122
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,000
believed in God.

123
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:18,502
Isaac Newton.

124
00:04:18,503 --> 00:04:19,836
Albert Einstein.

125
00:04:19,837 --> 00:04:21,939
Even Charles Darwin.

126
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,674
(congregation ah'ing)

127
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:27,044
So Darwin's right about God
and wrong about evolution?

128
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:28,612
Now you're gettin' it.

129
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:30,280
Let's give it up
for Sheldon, everybody.

130
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:32,482
What a good sport. Oh.

131
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,518
(organ playing)

132
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,954
ADULT SHELDON:
But I wasn't a good sport.

133
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:38,889
At that moment,
I vowed to come back

134
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,893
the following Sunday
and destroy Pastor Jeff.

135
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:44,562
(knocking)

136
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,304
Uh, hello, Mr. Cooper.

137
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:55,772
Is Missy home?

138
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,343
Hello, Billy.
No, she's at church.

139
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:02,012
I brought her eggs
from my chickens.

140
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:03,914
I see that.

141
00:05:03,915 --> 00:05:06,951
You can boil them
or scramble them.

142
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,420
Okay.

143
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:12,789
I like fried.

144
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,259
Okay.

145
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,997
I don't like poached.

146
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,799
Okay.

147
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,436
Thank you for your time.

148
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,476
Okay.

149
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,846
MARY: You want me to cook
those eggs for you, baby?

150
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:37,748
No. They're a gift.

151
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:39,549
Sorry.

152
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,251
He even wrote me a note.

153
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:45,255
"Eggs from your
secret admirer. Billy."

154
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:46,990
GEORGE SR. (calls):
Mary, can you come in here?

155
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,492
I'm cookin'.

156
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,727
I really need you
to come in here.

157
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,597
What on earth?

158
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,432
Uh-oh.

159
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:56,600
What?

160
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,934
Listen to this.

161
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,103
"French philosopher,

162
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:02,873
"mathematician and physicist,
Blaise Pascal,

163
00:06:02,874 --> 00:06:06,376
"argued a rational person
should believe God exists

164
00:06:06,377 --> 00:06:09,246
"because you have everything
to gain if you're right,

165
00:06:09,247 --> 00:06:11,581
and nothing to lose
if you're wrong."

166
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,750
Sounds right.

167
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,185
(footsteps approaching)

168
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:16,553
MARY:
Meemaw is coming over

169
00:06:16,554 --> 00:06:18,588
to watch you-- I gotta go.

170
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,791
Where?
Daddy's not feeling good.

171
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,226
We're gonna go see a doctor.

172
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:25,495
Is he okay?
He's gonna be fine.

173
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:26,763
You just sit right there.

174
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:28,265
Meemaw's on her way over
to cook you dinner.

175
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,900
Can we come with you?

176
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,269
No. Just stay right there,
don't move.

177
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,205
George, let's go.

178
00:06:45,131 --> 00:06:48,133
How long are we
supposed to sit here?

179
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:48,733
I don't know.

180
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,935
She said don't move.

181
00:06:49,936 --> 00:06:52,572
She was very clear.

182
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:55,807
Hope I don't have
to go to the bathroom.

183

Sir, are you having
chest pains right now?

Yeah, a little bit.

197
00:07:28,174 --> 00:07:31,042
Any numbness
or pain in your arms?

198

Maybe this one.

203
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,784

Sorry about the fat, honey.

Well, don't just sit there--
follow it.
Why?

It's an ambulance--
it's going to the hospital.

Hang on.

the radio on real low?

Despite what it looks like,

I didn't pray to God
that night.

I prayed to Blaise Pascal.

if he was right
about the existence of God,

430

my request

For a brief moment,

453
00:18:46,086 --> 00:18:49,922
I was filled with
the healing power of faith.

454
00:18:49,923 --> 00:18:52,658
Then the next day,
we all got violently ill

455

from Billy Sparks' eggs,
and I was over it.

456

I thought I'd talk this morning
about how it all began.

457
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,121
Now, everybody knows how,
on the first day of creation,

458
00:19:04,122 --> 00:19:06,290
God said, "Let there be light."

459
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,292
And there was light.

he knew it was good.

the first three days?

God is light.

00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,245
So God's a photon?

469

God's what made photons
possible.
