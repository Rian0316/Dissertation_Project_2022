1
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,730
Max, thanks for agreeing to get in the spirit

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,550
and do holiday cupcakes.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:09,870
So much better than last year when you go so drunk

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,520
you turned the 12 days of Christmas

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,280
into the 12 steps of Christmas.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,560
Yeah, well, I finally gave in.

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,550
Christmas is like herpes.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,730
No matter what you do,

9
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,980
it's gonna flare up once a year.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,670
Oh, you made Feliz Navidad cupcake.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:27,560
I'm muy proud of you.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,110
And I think we're going to make muy mucho moolah

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,280
when Manuel comes manana.

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,600
You're the only person I know

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,850
who seems whiter speaking Spanish.

16
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,840
Feliz Navidad for our Spanish speaking friends.

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,490
And for kids raised like me,  Feliz "He's-not-your-dad."

18
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,980
And then, "Joy To The World" for the normals,

19
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,770
and for the hipsters, "Joint To The World."

20
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,730
For the kids, "Frosty The Snowman."

21
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,930
And for you, "Frosty With No Man."

22
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,230
Well, I didn't see Jack Frost nipping at your nips either.

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,460
Oh, here, this one's my favorite,

24
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,840
"Santa Claus Is Coming"--

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,850
Max, stop right there.

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,470
No, that was it. He's coming.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,690
Earl, change please.

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,560
"Earl, change please."

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,160
A phrase I heard from both my ex-wives.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,850
Wow, you have more Christmas cards

31
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,450
than Oscar Pistorius had excuses.

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,270
What can I say, Max? I spread a lot of goodwill.

33
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,030
It's also where I get all of my shirts.

34
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,640
Here you go. Have a nice holiday.

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,960
My two kids love this time of year.

36
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,240
And next Christmas, there will be three.

37
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,070
It's a boy.

38
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,850
My husband was so happy when I called him in Afghanistan.

39
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,570
Man, this time of year people are easier

40
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,150
than a fat girl in a tube top.

41
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,990
Oh, great. We can use this money

42
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,840
to order more of our cupcake T-shirts.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,370
No, we are using that to buy people Christmas gifts.

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,740
I was really looking forward to giving someone something

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,990
that wouldn't require the follow-up penicillin shot.

46
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,880
We need more shirts. These are really selling.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,020
The guy at table four said it's the perfect gift

48
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,860
for a girl you're not in love with, just strictly banging.

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,880
He bought three.

50
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,570
I happen to know for a fact

51
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,490
that everyone here's getting us stuff.

52
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,490
Han came in with a small package today

53
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,040
and also he was carrying a gift bag.

54
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,580
We'll find some money for the gifts.

55
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,640
People aren't expecting anything big.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,600
Happy holidays.

57
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,670
People just got the nothing big they were expecting.

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,690
Gather, please. I have a very special gift

59
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,270
for all my diner employees.

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,750
Health insurance?

61
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,480
Come on, it's Christmastime, not crazy time.

62
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,300
It's art. It's a one of a kind silk screen.

63
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,230
I did it by hand.

64
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,740
I figured that's how you always have to do it.

65
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,730
Han, it's the diner. This is amazing.

66
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,730
Open the door. I put something behind it

67
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,510
that reminds me of each of you.

68
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,820
Mine has Sophie.

69
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,770
Mine has a saxophone.

70
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,130
Mine has a cupcake.

71
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,960
Mine has a chainsaw.

72
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,500
Hey, everybody!

73
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,930
Holiday shopping tip:

74
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,250
Fill a Starbucks cup with vodka.

75
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,990
Also good for waitressing.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,710
Sophie, were you Christmas shopping?

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,410
Oh, you know I was!

78
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,720
Power strips!

79
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,400
Oh good. You got surge protectors.

80
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,830
Wow, that's the first time protection's

81
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,340
ever been used in your apartment.

82
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,410
Well, my Christmas village needs 75,000 watts.

83
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,320
And that's just to work my candy cane helicopter.

84
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,300
Sophie's been so busy with the Polish Society Decorating Contest.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,910
We haven't had sex in days.

86
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,680
Well, I got to beat my nemesis, Felka Bobenski.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,240
She wins every year.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,210
She's like the Modern Family of Christmas decorations

89
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,940
You know who's having a blue Christmas this year?

90
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,700
My balls.

91
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,800
I love this city at the holidays.

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
Yeah, the urine's all frozen

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,530
so you can't really smell it.

94
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,990
Manhattan is the best place to buy quality Christmas gifts.

95
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,110
We have 40 bucks.

96
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,510
Now, where are those duffel bags

97
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,450
full of stolen electronics sold for half the price

98
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,230
by Nairobi refugees?

99
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,800
Well, we better find them soon

100
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,470
or I'm going to give up and go to Radio Shack

101
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,100
like everyone else who goes to Radio Shack.

102
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,650
Oh my God, Max.

103
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,840
My childhood bank.

104
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,810
You had a childhood bank?

105
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,380
I didn't even have a childhood.

106
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,720
Come on, let's go. I stop in every few months

107
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,140
to get caught on the security cameras,

108
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,510
so people will think I'm still in the mix.

109
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,830
Trying to get caught on security cameras?

110
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,950
Whoa, we are different.

111
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,330
Yeah, we'll just go in and while we're in here,

112
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,950
well, I don't know, ask for a business loan.

113
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:53,650
We are not getting a business loan!

114
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,630
You tricked me into coming to the city.

115
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,420
At least knock me out and put me in the trunk like a person.

116
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,020
Okay, I hear you. No loan.

117
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,130
But can we at least go in there

118
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,850
so I can get a hit off some vault fumes

119
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,330
and a complimentary Christmas cocoa?

120
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,790
Yeah, I want one too.

121
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,790
It's so cold out here

122
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,080
my bra is suing my nipples for assault.

123
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,160
I'd say we ask for $15,000.

124
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,120
So close I almost smelled a 100.

125
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,390
What is with you?

126
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,020
If I wanted you to keep lying to me,

127
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,080
I'd date you.

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,650
Max, we need more capital

129
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,990
so we can buy our shirts in bulk,

130
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,780
and then, if we work even harder,

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,230
we can double our profit.

132
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,950
Okay, we won't pass even the credit check.

133
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,640
According to my Social Security number,

134
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,050
I died in a boat explosion years ago.

135
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,090
This is the time to apply.

136
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,180
Bankers have more guilt at Christmastime

137
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,740
because of It's A Wonderful Life.

138
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,720
And also 'cause they're Jewish.

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,410
I'm the one with the business degree,

140
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,300
and you have to trust me on this.

141
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,890
You know what? You're right.

142
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,400
You're the business genius. What do I know?

143
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,910
Let's go get that loan.

144
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,140
Thank you!

145
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,270
Yeah, I should have known that was too good to be true.

146
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,620
Max, come on.

147
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,530
The bank's there. Our shirt's in here.

148
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,990
Let's just go in, show them, and apply for that loan.

149
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,640
- Please! - No.

150
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,530
- Please! - No.

151
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,200
- Please! - No.

152
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,580
And that right there was a little something

153
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,570
called "us asking for a bank loan."

154
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,850
Now let's go.

155
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,070
I'm not leaving here until you tell me

156
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,130
what the underlying issue is.

157
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,400
I'm not in love with you anymore.

158
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,700
Max, be serious.

159
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,540
This whole T-shirt was your idea.

160
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,780
What's the real problem?

161
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,710
That's the problem.

162
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,240
Those shirts were my idea

163
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,600
and nothing that comes from me is worth $15,000.

164
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,860
Aside from that baby I sold on E-baby.

165
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,890
Max, I know these T-shirts are a money-maker.

166
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,740
Oh, I have a money-maker and that's not it.

167
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,700
I can prove it.

168
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,930
Look, this is Rodney,

169
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,970
my childhood over-priced clothing store.

170
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,020
If I had known we were going on the childhood tour today,

171
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,550
I would have worn more comfortable shoes

172
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,330
and stayed home.

173
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,580
See the shirt on the mannequin?

174
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,730
At least $200.

175
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,530
And there's no reason we can't sell ours for just as much.

176
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,270
I'll show you. Follow me.

177
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,680
Oh, okay, I will. But not on Instagram,

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,200
'cause you're out of control.

179
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,850
This place is fancy

180
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,370
and I've been to the new Port Authority in Newark.

181
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,750
Just trust me, okay?

182
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,460
You need to jump on those Wang pumps

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,820
or like Ben Affleck, they will be "Gone, girl."

184
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,360
Let me do the talking. I speak his language.

185
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,510
And what language is that? Portu-gays?

186
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,790
Hello, ladies. Welcome to Rodney.

187
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm Barry.

188
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,290
Doing a little holiday shopping?

189
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,060
We're not allowed to say Christmas.

190
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,100
As a matter of fact, we're doing a little holiday selling.

191
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,360
Oh, you're "selling."

192
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,440
Got it. Molly? Coke?

193
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,470
Not that I'm interested.

194
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,350
I've been clean since Fire Island 2010.

195
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,300
And 2012.

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,220
It must be hard to not be high and be you.

197
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
Because it's hard for me

198
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,410
to just be near you and not be high.

199
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,960
Yeah, you get it, girl.

200
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
Actually, we wanted to see if you'd be interested

201
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,430
in selling one of our fabulous graphic t-shirts.

202
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,980
Oh, n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n--

203
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,370
all sorts of "no", Okay?

204
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,390
As much as I love a fez, a caftan, and a teenage boy,

205
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,330
this isn't Morocco.

206
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,850
That's a really long and boring version of "No."

207
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,370
It's like you just did  "No! The One Woman Show."

208
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,490
Here's our T-shirt--

209
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,310
Look.

210
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll tell you two what I said to a young Marc Jacobs.

211
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,570
Stop offering, I'm off the junk.

212
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,130
Merry Holiday.

213
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,140
I'll show Mary a holiday.

214
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,880
Our shirts are just as good as these.

215
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,820
He just needs to see it.

216
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,500
Here, hold this.

217
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,110
What are you? American Psycho?

218
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,550
As soon as someone says "No" to you,

219
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,320
you start dismembering women.

220
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,350
I can't get her shirt off.

221
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,610
Tell her she can spend the night

222
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,150
and you'll buy her a waffle in the morning.

223
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,200
Okay, hand me our shirt.

224
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
I think this is gonna be big for us.

225
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,800
You also think Michael Buble rocks.

226
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,160
Oh, I have to hurry. Barry is coming.

227
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,370
Barry is coming.

228
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,460
I'm guessing mostly with strangers.

229
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,250
Seriously?

230
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,860
Seriously?

231
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,800
Ser-I-ous-ly?

232
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,520
So cute.

233
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,410
And look on the back, "Cream Filled."

234
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,760
Funny.

235
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,720
People will think I have a personality.

236
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,770
Barry, put this with my other stuff.

237
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,750
How much?

238
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,990
300.

239
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,560
Forget the sober story. That guy is high.

240
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,850
I'll take ten.

241
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,440
They'll make great Hanukkah gifts

242
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,990
for my friends who don't hate their arms.

243
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,090
All our shirts just got bought by a rich dead lady.

244
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,360
I'll need 30 more by Friday.

245
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,600
Yes, I'm still holding.

246
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,970
I need to place a rush t-shirt order.

247
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,660
No, no, no, no, no. Don't put me on hold again.

248
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,780
I've been through seven rounds of

249
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,120
Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer.

250
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,460
And she just got run over again.

251
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,490
Now that we have all this crazy gay t-shirt money,

252
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,120
I think we should up the prices on these gifts.

253
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,850
So we agree, we're getting Earl a car.

254
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,750
Sophie is getting the country house with the lake she's always wanted.

255
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,400
Max, Rodney is selling our shirts for 300,

256
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,570
but we only get 25 of that.

257
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,310
And you can't buy a house for $750.

258
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,490
It's not Detroit.

259
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,850
Yes, hi, hi, hi. Finally a person.

260
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,510
I need 50 T-shirts by Friday.

261
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,140
But your business card says you guarantee next-day delivery.

262
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,940
Oh, you can't "Guarantee" that guarantee?

263
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,400
Okay, now Oleg.

264
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,450
What do you get a man who has nothing,

265
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,010
but shows you everything?

266
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,700
What do you mean "Is there anything else you can help me with?"

267
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,500
when did you help me at all?

268
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,500
And I'm beginning to think if Grandma works for you,

269
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,040
she didn't get run over by that reindeer,

270
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
she threw herself under a sleigh.

271
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,780
So, Sophie's getting a Snapple.

272
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,890
Like last year.

273
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,930
Max, we can't give up. We can do them ourselves.

274
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,670
We just need someone else to do them.

275
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,140
Come on, let's go.

276
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,620
There are customers who have been here

277
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,700
since Robin Thicke was relevant.

278
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,110
Wait a minute, Han. You silk-screened all those beautiful cards.

279
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,830
You have an artistic side.

280
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,940
Yeah, but no backside.

281
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,020
And a front side that shouldn't be allowed outside.

282
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,370
Why is this taking so long?

283
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,090
You did all those Christmas cards.

284
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,310
Aren't small creatures supposed to be fast?

285
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,780
Truth be told, those were supposed to be ready last year.

286
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,010
But, what was the rush?

287
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,410
You two weren't going anywhere.

288
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,920
Han, just a simple "Yes" or "No".

289
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,060
No judgment.

290
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,080
Have you had sex with this machine?

291
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,250
The only thing worse than you two working for me

292
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,590
is me working for you.

293
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,310
You haven't even given me water.

294
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,630
Water is for closers.

295
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,270
By "closers," I mean people who actually make clothes.

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
Who's that?

297
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,050
Han, did you call Child Protective Service on us?

298
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,810
'Cause those bruises could be from anyone.

299
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,340
Han, you've only made one shirt in two hours.

300
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,240
And it's a masterpiece. Do you want one Citizen Kane

301
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,580
or 30 Here Comes the Booms?

302
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,480
Guys, I need your help.

303
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,240
Sophie's right behind me and needs some cheering up.

304
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,750
I haven't seen her this depressed

305
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,340
since she woke up mid-coitus last night.

306
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,050
Hi.

307
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,340
Hi. Hi, girls.

308
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,800
Merry Christmas.

309
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,310
Quick question:

310
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,050
if I were to turn on that oven and close all the windows,

311
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,350
would I die?

312
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,120
Nope.

313
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,710
Otherwise I wouldn't be standing here

314
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,370
next to Kim Jong-Only-Done-One.

315
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,080
Sophie, what's the problem?

316
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,810
Tell Han while he gets back to work.

317
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,160
And Han, pick up the pace

318
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
or I'm going to start the pinching again.

319
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,840
I'm gonna lose the Christmas decorating contest.

320
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,700
Oh, I have nothing to live for.

321
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,110
Oh, Caroline, this is probably how you feel every day.

322
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
Sophie's competition made a live-action

323
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,030
North Pole workshop in front of her house.

324
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,660
Well, all I got upstairs is a light-up nativity

325
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,760
and $25,000 worth of Target Christmas decorations.

326
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,130
She blew five fuses last night.

327
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,890
I never thought I'd be jealous of a fuse.

328
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,630
Sophie, we really can't get into this now.

329
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,330
We are way behind with these T-shirts.

330
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,930
And these T-shirts are a once in a lifetime chance

331
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,230
for us to go to a new place with our business.

332
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,150
Oh yeah, I hear you, girls.

333
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,070
I mean, what am I doing here

334
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,040
sitting worrying about some silly contest?

335
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,680
It's Christmas.

336
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,060
Come on everybody.

337
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,380
We should all be helping the girls.

338
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,930
Really? That would be so amazing.

339
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,950
Sure! And you wouldn't even have to pay me back

340
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,630
by letting me use your barn and your horse tomorrow night

341
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,230
for a live nativity scene, which you would all have to be in.

342
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,040
Or something like that.

343
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,220
I think we just had a seasonal shake-down.

344
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,570
Han's doing the last one. We're gonna make it.

345
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,380
I can't believe you're in such a good mood with that beard.

346
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,260
Last week when you found those two chin hairs,

347
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,000
you weren't so chipper.

348
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,690
I'm just so happy I have new clothes.

349
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,270
Okay, final shirt.

350
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,190
Then I get you two out of my angel hair.

351
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,810
Han, you know, if it weren't for you,

352
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,640
we would have never gotten this done.

353
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,650
You really are a little angel.

354
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,350
Yeah, you are. But I'm still surprised

355
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,920
you weren't cast as the baby.

356
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,520
Oh, I was asked, but I declined.

357
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,590
I spent ten year getting out of diapers.

358
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,320
I'm not getting back in.

359
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,310
Han, for your Christmas gift,

360
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,730
I'll pretend I never heard that.

361
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,640
Places everybody.

362
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,370
The judges are coming. I'm ready.

363
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,240
Joseph's ready. Cabbage Patch Christ is ready.

364
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,750
Come on!

365
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,240
What's with the cleavage?

366
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,970
I know.

367
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,360
She's like the Not-So-Virgin Mary.

368
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,810
Angel, Shepherd, Lady with the beard,

369
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,740
come on, get in the stable.

370
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,690
Stable?

371
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,970
The way we look it should be an "Unstable."

372
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,880
Everybody ready? I'm going to open the barn door.

373
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,120
Yeah, I think your barn door's already a little open.

374
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,250
Okay now, who am I again?

375
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,390
Voltron?

376
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,590
I'm not gonna lie. One of the wise men

377
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,570
might have smoked some "Myrrh-ijuana."

378
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,620
There are customers who have been here

379
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,150
That was a very nice Christmas gift, Max.

380
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,010
Thanks, Earl. By the way, Sophie,

381
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,860
the barn and us dressed like idiots?

382
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,380
That's your Christmas gift.

383
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,630
Oh, and hey, bang Oleg later.

384
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,440
Oleg, that's your gift.

385
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,370
How did you know?

386
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,490
Before they come in, let's just take a moment to look around

387
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,760
and really let in the true spirit of Christmas.

388
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,170
I don't remember writing you a monologue.

389
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,370
Shut up!

390
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,710
Get your ass over by the horse.

391
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,090
Come on, Han. Hit the music.

392
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,370
All right, everybody,

393
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,670
look holy.

394
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,370
Best I can do is my underwear.

395
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,850
Oh , crap!

396
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,760
Oh, that's right, Felka.

397
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm the freakin' mother of God.

398
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,850
We won!

399
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,360
I'm so happy we won.

400
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,840
We won! We Won!

401
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,930
Okay, show's over.

402
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,460
Dump the kid, I'll be upstairs.

403
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,500
Max, take care of Cabbage Patch Christ.

404
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,780
Here, Han. You got a buddy your own size.

405
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,980
Thank you so much, Barry.

406
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,120
And remember, I want 50 more shirts

407
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,100
after the first of the year when I'm back from rehab.

408
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,910
'Cause ladies, I am planning a very white Christmas.

409
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,530
Max, this is amazing!

410
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,970
Do you know what just happened in there?

411
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,520
Yeah, I stole some dope-ass fingerless gloves.

412
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
We're in business with them now.

413
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,540
You have to bring those back.

414
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,310
I got them for you.

415
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,890
Okay.

416
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,750
This is like a Christmas miracle.

417
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,960
Our shirts are being sold in

418
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,480
the most exclusive bitchy boutique in Manhattan

419
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,100
and they want more, lots more.

420
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,340
Hey, let's go into your childhood bank.

421
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,200
I need to take an adult pee.

422
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,020
Okay, but this isn't home, so remember,

423
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,370
put the seat down when you're done.

424
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,030
And while we're in there, we can apply for that loan.

425
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,220
No, no, no, no, no. We can't.

426
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,480
Now I'm afraid.

427
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,290
Come on, what's the real issue here?

428
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,430
We just had this amazing success.

429
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,080
And it looks like things are going our way,

430
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,060
and if we go in there, it could all be ruined.

431
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,220
You know what would ruin our lives even more?

432
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,700
If we don't get that loan and have to spend hours

433
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,130
with Han standing under us trying to finish those shirts.

434
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,140
Well, that's a real "Nightmare Before Christmas."

435
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,020
Let's go.

436
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,490
Good, cause I'm starting to pee a little.

437
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,860
He gave us a loan!

438
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,990
Is everyone who works on the street high?

439
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,800
I can't believe it. It didn't go bad.

440
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,210
I'm getting everything I want.

441
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,710
Walk on the outside of the sidewalk.

442
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm gonna get hit by a bus.

443
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,000
I mean, how could he give us a loan?

444
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,550
I didn't even have to flash my boobs.

445
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,240
Then why did you do it?

446
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,590
I don't know. They were making it rain.

447
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,720
I felt obliged.

448
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,350
Max, do you have a dollar?

449
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,920
I don't know. Do you have change for 10,000?

450
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,830
Yeah, here. For what?

451
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,350
For those less fortunate

452
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,260
Anne Hathaway's here?

453
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,860
Oh, my God. Look! Look!

454
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,310
Whoa, no way! No way!

455
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,540
Max, I have chills.

456
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,330
Well, it is snowing and there's no fingers on those gloves.

457
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,530
I love these.

458
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,210
I'm sorry I didn't get you anything.

459
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,990
I'm just not a thief.

460
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,910
What do you mean you didn't get me anything?

461
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,820
You got me everything. Look.
