1
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:08,241
OLDER TED: Kids, I'm gonna tell you
an incredible story.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,744
The story of how I met your mother.

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,713
- Are we being punished for something?
- No.

4
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,950
- Yeah, is this gonna take a while?
- Yes.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,830
Twenty-five years ago, before I was Dad,
I had this whole other life.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:28,020
<i>It was way back in 2005.</i>

7
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:30,797
<i>I was 27, just starting
to make it as an architect...</i>

8
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:33,900
<I>and living in New York with Marshall,
my best friend from college.</I>

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,135
<i>My life was good.</i>

10
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,072
<i>And then Uncle Marshall
went and screwed the whole thing up.</i>

11
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,172
Will you marry me?

12
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,776
Yes. Perfect.

13
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,645
And then you're engaged,
you pop the champagne, you drink a toast,

14
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,747
you have sex on the kitchen floor.

15
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:50,216
- Don't have sex on our kitchen floor.
- Got it.

16
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,818
Thanks for helping me plan this out, Ted.

17
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,287
Dude, are you kidding? It's you and Lily.

18
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,723
I've been there for all the big moments
of you and Lily.

19
00:00:56,823 --> 00:01:01,413
The night you met,
your first date, other first things.

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,397
Yeah, sorry, we thought you were asleep.

21
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,632
It's physics, Marshall.

22
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,897
If the bottom bunk moves,
the top bunk moves, too.

23
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:13,639
My God, you're getting engaged tonight.

24
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,613
Yeah. What are you doing tonight?

25
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,547
<i>What was I doing? Here, Uncle Marshall...</i>

26
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,183
<i>was taking the biggest step of his life.
And me?</i>

27
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,518
<i>I'm calling up your Uncle Barney.</i>

28
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,856
Hey, so you know how
I've always had a thing for half-Asian girls?

29
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,994
Well, now I've got a new favorite.
Lebanese girls.

30
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,763
Lebanese girls are the new half-Asians.

31
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:38,465
Hey, you wanna do something tonight?

32
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:42,900
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

33
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,999
- Hey.
- Where's your suit?

34
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,609
Just once, when I say 'suit up,'
I wish you'd put on a suit.

35
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:53,194
- I did. That one time.
- It was a blazer.

36
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:58,485
You know, ever since college
it's been Marshall and Lily and me.

37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,121
Now it's gonna be
Marshall and Lily and me.

38
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,023
They'll get married, start a family.

39
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,191
Before long,
I'm that weird middle-aged bachelor...

40
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,671
their kids call 'Uncle Ted.'

41
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,231
I see what this is about.

42
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,702
Have you forgotten what I said to you
the night we met?

43
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,947
Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.

44
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,742
- Barney. We met at the urinal.
- Oh, right. Hi.

45
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,212
Lesson one, lose the goatee.
It doesn't go with your suit.

46
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,915
- I'm not wearing a suit.
- Lesson two, get a suit.

47
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,225
Suits are cool. Exhibit A.

48
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:32,685
Lesson three,

49
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,589
don't even think about getting married
till you're 30.

50
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,358
Thirty. Right, you're right.

51
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,326
I guess it's just, your best friend
gets engaged,

52
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,630
- you start thinking about that stuff.
- I thought I was your best friend.

53
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,460
Ted, say I'm your best friend.

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,169
- You're my best friend, Barney.
- Good.

55
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,971
Then as your best friend, I suggest we play
a little game I like to call,

56
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,306
'Have you met Ted?'

57
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,075
No, no, no, no, we're not playing
'Have you met Ted.'

58
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,175
Hi, have you met Ted?

59
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,446
- Hi, I'm Ted.
- Yasmin.

60
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,963
- It's a very pretty name.
- Thanks. It's Lebanese.

61
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,288
Hey.

62
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:09,389
(GROANS)

63
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,690
I'm exhausted.

64
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,160
It was finger-painting day at school
and a 5-year-old boy...

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,555
got to second base with me.

66
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:21,097
- Wow, you're cooking?
- Yes, I am.

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,805
Are you sure that's a good idea
after last time.

68
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:28,808
You looked really creepy without eyebrows.

69
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,909
I can handle this.

70
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,245
I think you'll find
I'm full of surprises tonight.

71
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,647
So there's more surprises? Like what?

72
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,683
<i>Marshall was in his second year
of law school,</i>

73
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,152
<i>so he was pretty good
at thinking on his feet.</i>

74
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,517
Boogedy boo! And that's all of them.

75
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,123
I'm gonna go cook.

76
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,495
I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am.

77
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,730
I just couldn't imagine settling down
right now.

78
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,601
- So do you think you'll ever get married?
- Well, maybe eventually.

79
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,101
Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park.

80
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:00,974
Simple ceremony.
We'll write our own vows.

81
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,075
Band, no DJ.

82
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,345
People will dance,
I'm not gonna worry about it.

83
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,481
Damn it, why did Marshall
have to get engaged?

84
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,018
Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning
out his own imaginary wedding, huh?

85
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:15,788
- Actually, I think it's cute.
- Well, you're clearly drunk.

86
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,888
One more for the lady!

87
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,983
Oh, hey, look what I got.

88
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,155
Oh, honey, champagne.

89
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,735
Yeah.

90
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,941
No, you are too old to be scared
to open a bottle of champagne.

91
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,009
I'm not scared.

92
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,109
- Then open it.
- Fine.

93
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,080
Please, open it.

94
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,049
Gosh, you are unbelievable, Marshall.

95
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,752
<i>There are two big questions
a man has to ask in life.</i>

96
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,555
<i>One you plan out for months,
the other just slips out...</i>

97
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,356
<i>when you're half-drunk at some bar.</i>

98
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,858
Will you marry me?

99
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,927
You wanna go out sometime?

100
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,027
Of course, you idiot!

101
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,865
I'm sorry, Carl's my boyfriend.

102
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,068
What's up, Carl?

103
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:10,582
I promised Ted we wouldn't do that.

104
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,846
Did you know there's a Pop-Tart
under your fridge?

105
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,946
No, but dibs.

106
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,316
Where's that champagne?

107
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:21,948
I wanna drink a toast with my fiancée.

108
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,627
I don't know why I was so scared of this.

109
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,229
It's pretty easy, right?

110
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,329
(LILY SCREAMING)

111
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,234
Why am I freaking out all of a sudden?
This is crazy.

112
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,868
I'm not ready to settle down.

113
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:38,738
How does Carl land a Lebanese girl?

114
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,906
The plan's always been...

115
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,574
don't even think about it until you're 30.

116
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,410
Exactly. The guy doesn't even own a suit.

117
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,412
Plus, Marshall's found the love of his life.

118
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,748
Even if I was ready, which I'm not,

119
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,608
but if I was, it's like,
'Okay, I'm ready. Where is she?'

120
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,523
<i>And there she was.</i>

121
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,200
<i>It was like something from an old movie...</i>

122
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,436
<i>where the sailor sees the girl
across the crowded dance floor,</i>

123
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,305
<i>turns to his buddy and says,</i>

124
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,808
<i>'See that girl?
I'm gonna marry her someday.'</i>

125
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,376
Hey, Barney, see that girl?

126
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,015
Oh, yeah. You just know she likes it dirty.

127
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,051
- Go say hi.
- I can't just go say hi.

128
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,352
I need a plan.

129
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,987
I'm gonna wait
until she goes to the bathroom,

130
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,556
then I'll strategically place myself
by the jukebox so that...

131
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,656
Hi, have you met Ted?

132
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,928
Hi.

133
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,519
Let me guess. Ted.

134
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,435
I'm sorry, Lily.

135
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,837
I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.

136
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,827
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hit her?

137
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,810
Hit me? Please.

138
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,746
This guy can barely even spank me
in bed for fun.

139
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,516
He's all, like, 'Oh, honey, did that hurt?'

140
00:06:56,616 --> 00:07:00,186
And I'm, like,
'Come on, let me have you, you pansy.'

141
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,490
- Wow, a complete stranger.
- No, no, no, it's okay. Go on.

142
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,059
So, these spankings,

143
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,185
<i>are you in pajamas or au natural?</i>

144
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:13,266
- So what do you do?
- I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.

145
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:15,835
- Oh.
- Well, kind of a reporter.

146
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,404
I do those dumb little fluff pieces
at the end of the news.

147
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:22,736
You know, like,
'Monkey who can play the ukulele.'

148
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,911
But I'm hoping to get some
bigger stories soon.

149
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,114
Bigger, like,
'Gorilla with an upright bass?'

150
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,594
Sorry. You're really pretty.

151
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,855
- Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,990
See, the one in the middle
just got dumped by her boyfriend.

153
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,660
So tonight, every guy is 'the enemy.'

154
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,061
You know,
if it'll make your friend feel better...

155
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,764
you could throw a drink in my face.
I don't mind.

156
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:49,302
She would love that.
And it does look fun in the movies.

157
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,270
Hey, you wanna have dinner with me
Saturday night?

158
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,340
Oh, I can't.
I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday.

159
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,076
Some guy's attempting
to make the world's biggest pancake.

160
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,445
- Guess who's covering it?
- That's gonna take a week?

161
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,881
Yeah, he's gonna eat it, too.
It's another record.

162
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,276
Hey, what's taking so long?

163
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:09,288
I know this is a long shot,
but how about tomorrow night?

164
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,388
Yeah. What the hell.

165
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,330
Jerk!

166
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,532
That was fun.

167
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,901
De... Wait for it... nied.

168
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,773
Denied.

169
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:27,974
We're going out tomorrow night.

170
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,576
I thought we were playing
Lazer Tag tomorrow night.

171
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,246
Yeah, I was never gonna go play Lazer Tag.

172
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,886
<i>The next night, I took her out
to this little bistro in Brooklyn.</i>

173
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,053
Wow.

174
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:44,624
- That is one bad-ass blue French horn.
- Yeah.

175
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,955
Sort of looks like a Smurf penis.

176
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,829
<i>Son, a piece of advice.</i>

177
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,833
<i>When you go on a first date,
you really don't want to say Smurf penis.</i>

178
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,738
<i>Girls don't ordinarily like that.</i>

179
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,153
<i>But this was no ordinary girl.</i>

180
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,610
Lily.

181
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,015
How long have you been sitting there?

182
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,208
Stupid eye patch.

183
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,885
Mom, Dad,
I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.

184
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,193
Marshall, how have I always described
my perfect woman?

185
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,928
Let's see.

186
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,029
She likes dogs?

187
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,497
I've got five dogs.

188
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,631
She drinks Scotch?

189
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,668
I love a Scotch
that's old enough to order its own Scotch.

190
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,603
<i>Can quote obscure lines from
Ghostbusters?</i>

191
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:35,803
'Ray, when someone asks you
if you're a God, you say, 'Yes!''

192
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:38,177
And I'm saving the best for last.

193
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,513
Do you want these? I hate olives.

194
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,608
- She hates olives. Awesome!
- The Olive Theory.

195
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,453
The Olive Theory
is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily.

196
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,555
He hates olives, she loves them.
And in a weird way,

197
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,357
that's what makes them
such a great couple.

198
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:53,457
Perfect balance.

199
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:59,406
You know, I've had a jar of olives
just sitting in my fridge forever.

200
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,237
I could take them off your hands.

201
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,237
They're all yours.

202
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,038
Oh, it is on!

203
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,858
It is on till the break of dawn.

204
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:15,014
But, wait, it's only the break of 10:30.
What happened?

205
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,050
I gotta get one of those blue French horns
for over my fireplace.

206
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,886
It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.

207
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,320
- No green clarinet?
- Nope.

208
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,822
Come on, no purple tuba?

209
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,472
It's a Smurf penis or no dice.

210
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,460
There you are!

211
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,596
We got a jumper.
Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge.

212
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:33,076
Come on, you're covering it.

213
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,302
All right, I'll be right there.

214
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,402
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,294
I had a really great time tonight.

216
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,742
Yeah, well.

217
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,842
So, did you kiss her?

218
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
No, the moment wasn't right.

219
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,282
Look, this woman
could actually be my future wife.

220
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,150
I want our first kiss to be amazing.

221
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,844
Oh, Ted, that is so sweet.

222
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:57,523
So, you chickened out like a little bitch.

223
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:00,059
What? I did not chicken out.

224
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,261
You know what?
I don't need to take first kiss advice...

225
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,798
from some pirate who hasn't been single
since the first week of college.

226
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,401
Ted, anyone who's single
would tell you the same thing.

227
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,070
Even the dumbest single person alive.

228
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,400
And if you don't believe me, call him.

229
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:20,313
Hey, loser, how's not playing Lazer Tag?
Because playing Lazer Tag is awesome.

230
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,615
Oh, I killed you, Connor.
Don't make me get your mom.

231
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,717
Hey, listen,
I need your opinion on something.

232
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,821
Okay, meet me at the bar in 15 minutes.
And suit up!

233
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:32,258
So, these guys think I chickened out.
What do you think?

234
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:36,438
I can't believe you're still not wearing a suit.

235
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,564
She didn't even give me the signal.

236
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,767
What, is she gonna
bat her eyes at you in Morse code?

237
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,867
'Ted,

238
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:45,204
'kiss me.'

239
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:50,234
- No, you just kiss her.
- Not if you don't get the signal.

240
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,580
- Did Marshall give me the signal?
- No!

241
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I didn't, I swear.

242
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,853
But, see, at least tonight,
I get to sleep knowing Marshall and me,

243
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,689
never gonna happen.
You should've kissed her.

244
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,324
I should've kissed her.

245
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,393
Well, maybe in a week
when she gets back from Orlando.

246
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,862
A week? That's like a year in hot-girl time.

247
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:10,997
She'll forget all about you.

248
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,934
Mark my words,
you will never see that one again.

249
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,769
There she is.

250
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,759
She's cute. Hey, Carl, turn it up.

251
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,374
<i>...persuaded him to reconsider.</i>

252

<i>- back to you, Bill.
- The guy didn't jump.</i>

256
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,551
I'm gonna go kiss her.

257
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,820
- Right now.
- Look, dude, it's midnight.

258
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,858
As your future lawyer,
I'm gonna advise you that's freaking crazy.

259
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:40,259
I never do anything crazy.

260
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,995
I'm always waiting for the moment,
planning the moment.

261
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,164
Well, she's leaving tomorrow
and this may be the only moment

262
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,465
I'm gonna get.

263
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,603
I gotta do what that guy couldn't.
I gotta take the leap.

264
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,904
Okay, not a perfect metaphor...

265
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,539
'cause for me
it's fall in love and get married...

266
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,639
and for him it's death.

267
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,445
Actually, that is a perfect metaphor.

268
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,860
By the way, did I congratulate you two?

269
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:05,415
- I'm doing this.
- Let's go.

270
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,441
- Word up.
- We're coming with you.

271
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,454
Barney?

272
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,798
All right, but under one condition.

273
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:17,196
Look at you, you beautiful bastard,
you suited up.

274
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,101
This is totally going in my blog.

275
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,574
Stop the car. Pull over right here.

276
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,203
I gotta do something.

277
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,908
Excuse me. Pardon me, just a sec.

278
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,943
- Enjoy your coffee.
- Hey!

279
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,278
Hey!

280
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,378
Go, go, go!

281
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,041
Everybody brings flowers.

282
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,691
Okay, moment of truth.

283
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:53,099
- Wish me luck.
- Ted's gonna get it on with a TV reporter.

284
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,292
'This just in.' Okay.

285
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:02,041
- Kiss her, Ted. Kiss her good.
- Kiss the crap out of that girl.

286
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,243
Marshall, remember this night.

287
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,912
When you're the best man at our wedding
and you give a speech,

288
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,477
you're gonna tell this story.

289
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:12,418
Why does he get to be the best man?

290
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,518
I'm your best friend!

291
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,991
<i>As I waIked up to that door,
a million thoughts raced through my mind.</i>

292
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,494
<i>Unfortunately,
one particular thought did not.</i>

293
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,594
I've got five dogs.

<i>Not good, not good.</i>

296
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,400
- No!
- Get back in there.

297
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
You're wearing a suit!

ROBIN: Ted?

299
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,208
Hi.

300
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,778
I was just...

301
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,551
Come on up.

302
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,054
MARSHALL: He's in.

303
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,795
So, Ranjit, you must have done it
with a Lebanese girl?

304
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,164
Okay, that's my Barney limit.

305
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,267
I'm gonna see
if that bodega has a bathroom.

306
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,302
Actually, I'm from Bangladesh.

307
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,823
- The women hot there?
- Here's a picture of my wife.

308
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,712
(WHISPERING) A simple 'no'
would have sufficed.

309
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,812
She's lovely.

310
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:22,655
So, Ted, what brings you back to Brooklyn
at 1:00 in the morning in a suit?

311
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,755
I was just hoping to...

312
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,026
get those olives...

313
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,195
that you said I could have.

314
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,364
Would you like those olives
with some gin and vermouth?

315
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,099
Are you trying to get me drunk?

316
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,837
For starters.

317
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,106

318
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,276
Thank you.

319
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,116
So, Marshall,
this Olive Theory based on you and Lily.

320
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,918
- Yeah.
- You hate olives.

321
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,222
- Lily loves them, you can't stand them.
- Yeah, I hate olives.

322
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:58,524
Two weeks ago,
Spanish bar on 79th Street.

323
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,854
Dish of olives. You had some. What up?

324
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,633
You have to swear
that this does not leave this cab.

325
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,758
- I swear.
- I swear.

326
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,506
On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad.

327
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,709
Lily asked if she could have my olives.

328
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,211
I said, 'Sure, I hate olives.'

329
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,980
But you like olives.

330
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,649
Well, I was 18, okay? I was a virgin.

331
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,887
Been waiting my whole life
for a pretty girl to want my olives.

332
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,023
Marshall, I'm gonna give you
an early wedding present.

333
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,123
Don't get married.

334
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,205
I think I like your Olive Theory.

335
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,339
I think I like your new French horn.

336
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,564
I think I like your nose.

337
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,478
I think I'm in love with you.

338
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,579
What?

339
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,647
What?

340
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,848
What?

341
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,017
Come on, man, you said your stomach's
been hurting, right?

342
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,887
You know what that is? Hunger.
You're hungry for experience.

343
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:05,889
Hungry for something new.
Hungry for olives.

344
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,827
But you're too scared
to do anything about it.

345
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:10,952
Yeah, I'm scared, okay?

346
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,868
But when I think of spending
the rest of my life with Lily,

347
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:18,943
committing forever, no other women,

348
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,645
doesn't scare me at all.

349
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,207
I'm marrying that girl.

350
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,513
Lily.

351
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,613
Lily, I like olives.

352
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,382
We'll make it work.

353
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,319
(SIGHING)

354
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,529
So, Orlando? You gonna hit Disney World?

355
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,460
- You love me?
- Oh, God.

356
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,639
I can't believe I said that.
Why did I say that?

357
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,739
Who says that?

358
00:17:55,774 --> 00:17:58,239
- I should just go.
- Hold on.

359
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,477
Wait a minute.

360
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:03,716
I promised you these.

361
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,817
- Olives.
- Yeah.

362
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,719
Thanks. I love you.

363
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:08,819
What is wrong with me?

364
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,392
Why are we still sitting here? Let's go.
We can still make last call.

365
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:17,997
What do you say, Lil?
'Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum'?

366
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:23,745
- 'Cause you're a pirate?
- Okay, eye patch gone.

367
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,904
And we can't just abandon Ted.

368
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:29,008
If it doesn't go well up there,
he's gonna need some support.

369
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,044
It's been, like, 20 minutes.
Do you think they're doing it?

370
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,679
You think they're doing it
in front of the dogs?

371
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,547
Doggie style.

372
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,750
I knew this girl in college,
she had this Golden Retriever...

373
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,952
Okay, we can go to the bar.
Just stop talking.

374
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,052
Hit it, Ranjit.

375
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,861
So, when you tell this story to your friends,

376
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,096
could you avoid the word 'psycho'?

377
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:53,391
I'd prefer 'eccentric.'

378
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,299
Goodnight, psycho.

379
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,174
Great.

380
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,249
- How do I get to the F train?
- Oh.

381
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,575
- Two blocks, that way and take a right.
- Thanks.

382
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,650
You know what?

383
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,856
I'm done being single. I'm not good at it.

384
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,592
Look, obviously,
you can't tell a woman you just met...

385
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:24,458
you love her, but it sucks that you can't.

386
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,833
I'll tell you something, though. If a woman,

387
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,769
not you, just some hypothetical woman,

388
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,539
were to bear with me through all this,

389
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:37,076
I think I'd make a damn good husband
because that's the stuff I'd be good at.

390
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:41,681
Stuff like making her laugh
and being a good father...

391
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:45,362
and waIking her five hypothetical dogs.

392
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,118
Being a good kisser.

393
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,459
- Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.
- Oh, I've got references.

394
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,559
Goodnight, Ted.

395
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,470
- And I'm a good handshaker.
- That's a pretty great handshake.

396
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,858
And that was it.
I'll probably never see her again.

397
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,683
- What?
- That was the signal.

398
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:21,687
That long, lingering handshake.
You should've kissed her.

399
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,289
There's no such thing as the signal.

400
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,692
But, yeah, that was the signal.

401
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,792
Signal.

402
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,486
Carl, thank you.
There's something I gotta do.

403
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,568
By the way, you should've kissed her.

404
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,133
Carl, you guys weren't there.

405
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,952
I am so turned on right now.

406
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:46,645
Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal.

407
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,183
- That was not the signal.
- Yeah, Ted, we're not on you anymore.

408
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:54,616
- To my fiancée.
- To the future.

409
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
To one hell of a night.

410
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,132
That was not the signal.

411
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,366
<i>I asked her about it years later,
and, yeah, that was the signal.</i>

412
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,867
<i>I could've kissed her.</i>

413
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:12,804
<i>But that's the funny thing about destiny,
it happens whether you plan it or not.</i>

414
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,940
<i>I mean, I never thought
I'd see that girl again.</i>

415
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,175
<i>But it turns out,</i>

416
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,411
<i>I was just too close to the puzzle
to see the picture that was forming.</i>

417
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,980
Because that, kids, is the true story...

418
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,545
of how I met your Aunt Robin.

419
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,852
Aunt Robin?

420
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,720
I thought this was how you met Mom.

421
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,290
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.

422
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,689
Like I said, it's a long story.
