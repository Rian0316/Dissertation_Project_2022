嘿
Hey.

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:19,080
我刚刚收到了美国空军发来的邮件
Just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,020
我害怕 如果我回复了 他们就会知道我收到了
I'm just afraid if I respond, then they'll know I got it.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,550
哥们 当你打开邮件的时候 他们就知道你收到了
Dude, the minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,450
他们可能正在通过

摄像头看你
through the camera right now.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,260
天啊
Oh, God.

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,230
我觉得有人在跟踪我们
I think someone's following us.

16
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,070
在这里左转 看看会不会跟着我们
Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,200
为什么在这里转弯? 餐厅在另一个方向
Why is he turning here? The restaurant's the other way.

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,270
我也不知道 他有查路况的手机软件
I don't know. He uses that traffic app.

19
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,570
也许前面有事故
Maybe there's an accident.

20
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,140
那就跟着他
Oh, so follow him.

21
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,910
别啊!
Oh, no!

22
00:00:47,824 --> 00:00:48,912
Leonard 如果不介意的话 
Leonard, if you don't mind,

23
00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:50,250
我有点累了
I think I'm a little tired.

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:51,310
今晚就到这儿吧
I'm gonna call it a night.

25
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,550
好的 老爸
Sure, Dad.

26
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,320
我累坏了
I'm a little tuckered out myself.

27
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,450
大家明天早上见吧
Well, I will see you all in the morning.

28
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,950
要一起坐车吗?
Would you like to share a cab?

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,090
好啊
That would be fine.

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,760
- 你住哪儿?  - 威斯汀饭店
- Where are you staying?  - I'm at the Westin.

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,890
我也是
Well, so am I.

32
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,190
要一起喝一杯吗?
Could I interest you in a nightcap?

33
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,990
好主意
I think that you could.

34
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,590
现在...

35
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,032
嘿 Leonard
Leonard?

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,400
Leonard 你醒着吗?
Leonard?

37
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,670
怎么了?
What?

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,880
你有没有觉得我们可能会变成兄弟
You realize you and I could become brothers.

39
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,810
我们不会变成兄弟的
We're not gonna be brothers.

40
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,250
我妈妈也不会给你当后妈
We're not gonna be stepbrothers.

41
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,850
快睡吧
Go to sleep.

42
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,880
但愿如此
I hope you're right.

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,650
毕竟一个大男人 和他的哥哥嫂子同住
Because a grown man living with his brother

44
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,860
实在太诡异了
and his brother's wife is weird.

45
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,190
赶紧睡吧
Go to sleep.

46
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,260
好啵
Okay.

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,344
你觉得你爸和我妈 会不会正在
Do you think your father's doing unspeakable things

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
做羞羞的事情?
to my mother?

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
不会
No.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,340
你这么说是不是因为
Are you saying that

51
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,540
这是一件羞羞的事情?
because the things are unspeakable?

52
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,810
你们的父母都老了
Your parents are old.

53
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,740
他们应该九点半之前就做完羞羞的事情了
Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30.

54
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,810
赶紧睡吧
Go to sleep.

00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,880
好吧
Very well.

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,550
对不起啊 我也没想到婚礼之前会发生这么奇葩的事
I'm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.

57
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,320
天啊 我还以为我哥哥刚从监狱出来这件事
God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail

58
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,470
会让大家觉得尴尬
was gonna make everyone uncomfortable,

59
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,790
- 不过现在...  - 喂 要是你们想让我睡觉的话

60
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,690
就别再说话了

估计得一个半小时或者两个小时 看堵不堵车了
Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.

- 路上注意安全  - 好哒

哦对了 先跟你俩说好

Beverly过来之后 谁都别提昨晚的事
When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night.

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,544
懂我意思? 要装作
All right? As far as you're concerned,

77
00:02:50,544 --> 00:02:52,470
你们什么都不知道的样子
you don't know anything,

78
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,536
你们什么都没看见
you didn't see anything.

79
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:57,940
假装自己是白痴就好
I want you just to play dumb.

80
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,980
其实她亲自给我们示范一下什么是白痴 也挺好的
It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.

81
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,410
你说什么?

00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,180

我实在受不了你爸了
I just cannot stay here while your father

92
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,740
他这么羞辱我实在是太过分了
goes out of his way to humiliate me.

93
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,870
哪有啊 他怎么羞辱你了?
Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?

94
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,470
别闹了 Sheldon
Stop it, Sheldon.

95
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,080
我是应该说"我没闹"? 还是可以不用再装了?
Do I say "Stop what?" Or just throw in the towel?

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,280
我不懂 我何苦要看着你爸
I don't see why I should have to watch your father

97
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,480
对着一个满脑子圣经的村姑献殷勤
parade around with some Bible-thumping bumpkin.

98
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,790
不好意思 打断一下 虽然你说的都对
Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you're talking about,

99
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,990
但那是我妈啊
however accurately.

100
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,560
好了 Beverly
Okay, Beverly,

101
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
你太激动了吧?
aren't you overreacting a little?

102
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,830
他们只不过是一起坐了出租车 一起喝了一杯而已
All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap.

103
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,060
还都把手机关了
And turned their phones off.

104
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,330
别帮倒忙了!
Not helping, buddy.

105
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,800
妈 Penny和我都非常希望你来参加这次婚礼
Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this.

106
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,900
拜托了
Please stay.

107
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
是啊 而且如果你走了的话
Yeah, plus if you leave,

108
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,740
Alfred就会知道你在乎了
Alfred will know he got under your skin.

109
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,240
有道理 这可不行
Well, we can't have that.

110
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,310
还有啊 他们要是真的性接触了的话
You know, also, if they did have coitus,

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,310
我们就真的需要一个专业的精神科医生了
we'll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.

112
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,190
仔细想想这事还挺好玩的
It is funny when you think about it.

113
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,350
我可没觉得
Maybe to you.

114
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,420
你是没收到500刀的罚单
You didn't get a $500 traffic ticket.

115
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,760
谁让你开车的时候像个疯子似的
Because you were driving like a lunatic.

116
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,630
以为特工在追你也能被你讲成疯子的话
Hey, if thinking secret government agents

117
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,700
那... 好吧 随便你怎么说吧
are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then... yeah, okay.

118
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,940
我去开门
Oh, I'll get it.

119
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,570
交警抓到你的时候 你都的走不了直线了
It didn't help that you couldn't walk a straight line

120
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,710
谁也救不了你啊
when the cop pulled you over.

121
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,280
我怯场啊
I have performance anxiety.

122
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,350
你最应该知道了 (偶尔怯场表现在性方面)
You of all people should know that.

123
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,390

你为什么要说这些?
Why would you do that?

153
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,340
来加州看我了
in California.

154
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,240
是啊 幸好我是非暴力罪犯
Well, good thing I was a nonviolent offender,

155
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,310
不然的话我都不能离开本州
otherwise I couldn't have left the state.

156
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:23,180
好吧 别再说监狱的事了
All right, that's enough jail talk.

157
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,210
Penny知道我在那 她还给我送过烟呢
Penny knows where I was; she sent me cigarettes.

158
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,920
你给你哥哥寄烟?
You sent your brother cigarettes?

159
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,690
他可是制毒贩毒小能手 苏珊
He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan,

160
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,820
烟什么的就不要提了吧
I think we can let the cigarettes slide.

161
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,620
别一直在这里唱红脸
Stop trying to be the cool dad;

162
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,430
你可是有一件画着家里的猫的T恤呢
you have a shirt with our cat's picture on it.

163
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,760
既来之则安之吧
Anyway, we're here, slugger.

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,540
这下好了 现在他们知道我住的地方了
That's great, now they know where I live.

165
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,840
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,370
他们一直都知道你住在哪儿
They've always known where you live.

167
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,570
你如果不想被找到的话
Yeah, if you want to go off the grid,

168
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,840
非得搬回你妈妈的房子里不可了
you have to move out of your mother's house.

169
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,280
我们能讨论讨论刚刚我为了你
Can we take a moment to discuss

170
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,410
对政府工作人员撒谎的事情吗?
that I just lied to the government for you?

171
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,580
好啊
Yeah.

172
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,580
我反正是不会为你做到这种程度的
I would not have done that for you.

173
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,660
Howard 就直接打过去问问他想干嘛吧
Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.

174
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,560
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

175
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,090
对了
Hey,

176
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,160
一定要说 他来的时候你不在家
make sure you tell him that you weren't home when he came by

177
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
是你的印度朋友在你一进家门
and that your Indian friend gave you the message

178
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,830
就把消息转达给你了
the moment you stepped through the door.

179
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,440
喂 你好
Yes, hello. Uh,

180
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,570
我是Howard Wolowitz 给Richard Williams上校回电话
this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.

181
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,210
我收回刚才的话 别提到我
Oh, I take it back, don't mention me.

182
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,310
你好 Willians上校 我能为您做点什么?
Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you?

183
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,380
什么? 对 他是印度人
What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India.

184
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,420
不 我不知道他的移民身份
No, I don't know his immigration status.

185
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,420
淡定 我还在等着转接!
Relax, I'm still on hold!

186
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,190
我在
Speaking.

187
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,300
好的 我可以在星期四去找你
Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday.

188
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
就定在加州理工吧
Caltech is fine.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,100
我能问问这次会面是关于什么事吗?
Yeah, and may I ask what this is about?

190
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:57,410
不行?
I may not?

191
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,280
他也是这么跟我说的
That's what he said to me.

192
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,680
给你 妈妈
Here you are, Mother.

193
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,350
谢谢
Thank you.

194
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,050
我很高兴你决定留下来
I'm glad you decided to stay.

195
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,520
你的出席对我和Penny来说很特别
It's gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.

196
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,020
我在这真是度日如年
I can't wait for this day to be over.

197
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,220
是啊 特别得不行
Yeah, special, like that.

198
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,790
他们来了
That's them.

199
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,830
千万不要把事情
Please don't make things

200
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,800
弄得比现在更尴尬了
any more awkward than they already are.

201
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,700
那就是尴尬程度小于等于目前状态 明白
All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.

202
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,440
嘿 快进来
Hey, guys, come on in.

203
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,070
谢谢 早上好啊
Oh, thank you. Good morning.

204
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,970
早 你好
Morning. Hello.

205
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,010
大家今天过得好吗?
How is everyone today?

206
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,080
很好 你呢?
Good, and you?

207
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,110
不错 不错
Good, good. Good.

208
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,450
我也不错
I'm good, too.

209
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,220
当然了
Good.

210
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,220
你有没有玷污了我妈妈?
So, did you defile my mother or not?

211
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,860
Sheldon啊!
Sheldon!

212
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,930
你太没礼貌了
You're being rude.

213
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,390
我向你保证
If I may, I can assure you,

214
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,830
你妈妈和我除了拼车和聊天之外
your mother and I did nothing more

215
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,100
什么都没做
than share a cab and a conversation.

216
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,270
你们的谈话里有没有涉及到
Did that conversation include the phrase

217
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,370
"你下面的温柔乡真好看"之类的?
"Your genitals are a joy to behold"?

218
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,570
够了!
That's enough!

219
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:07,580
我保证 没有任何人说过这种话
Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.

220
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:12,280
那是因为你不认识他女朋友
You don't know his girlfriend very well.

221
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,220
也没看过我的温柔乡
Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.

222
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,020
好了 你们先收拾收拾
All right, you guys, uh, get settled in,

223
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,320
然后我们就去对面和他们打个招呼
then we'll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.

224
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,790
真是难以相信我竟然从来没见过Leonard
You know, It's hard to believe I've never met Leonard.

225
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,000
这个嘛 大概是他买小药丸
Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
都是找当地毒贩子吧
from a local vendor.

227
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,170
这不好笑 Wyatt
Not funny, Wyatt.

228
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,700
- 我觉得还不错啊  - 谢谢
- I thought it was really funny.  - Thanks.

229
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,040
好吧 如果你们都想拿我们的家丑来开玩笑的话
Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems,

230
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,110
我奉陪到底
then I can, too.

231
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,340
咚咚 谁啊?
Knock, knock. Who's there?

232
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,140
我家就是个笑话
Our family is an embarrassment.

233
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,750
- 这不算笑话  - 好了
- That's not much of a joke.  - Okay.

234
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,080
妈妈 我知道你很不安 但我保证
Listen, Mom, I know you're nervous, but I promise you,

235
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,420
没有人会对你或这个家说三道四的
no one is gonna judge you or this family.

236
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,050
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

237
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,220
但这毕竟是我们和Leonard父母的
It's just we're meeting Leonard's parents

238
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,620
第一次见面
for the first time,

239
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,860
他们都是搞学术的高级知识分子
and... and they're academics and... and intellectuals,

240
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,960
我不希望他们觉得我们是白人败类
and I don't want them thinking we're white trash.

241
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,370
那你还指望他们觉得我们是哪个人种的败类?
Well, what color trash do you think they'll believe?

242
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,840
为什么你觉得我会和一个刚认识的男人
How could you think that I would spend the night

243
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,340
共度春宵呢?
with a man I just met?

244
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,710
谁知道呢 毕竟一个叫耶稣的人说服了你去非洲建教堂
A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa.

245
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,080
你太弱了
You're kind of a sucker.

246
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,410
什么都没发生 对吧?
Well, nothing happened, right?

247
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,450
一切都结束了
I... It's over.

248
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,580
除非我们结第三次婚
Until we get married a third time,

249
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,520
否则你们俩都不用再见到对方了
you guys will never have to see each other again.

250
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,420
这个嘛 实际上不是这样的
Well, you know, actually that's not the case.

251
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,660
- Mary应该会来纽约看我  - 没错
- Mary may visit me in New York.  - Mm-hmm.

252
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,830
你爸爸也从没去过德州
And he's never been to Texas.

253
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,190
我们可以半路上见
Maybe we meet halfway.

254
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,970
什么? 在乔治亚的查塔胡奇国家森林里吗?
What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?

255
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:41,940
我不会是唯一一个知道半路是这里的人吧?
I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.

256
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,180
- 你们不会真的打算
- You're not seriously going

257
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,140
去看望对方吧?  - 为什么不会?
to visit each other. And why wouldn't we?

258
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
得了吧 你说这话不过是为了气我
Oh, please. You're just say this to antagonize me.

259
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,380
非也 Mary是个很不错的女人
Oh,Not at all. Mary happensing to be a wonderful woman.

260
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,410
如果气到你了 那只是附带奖励罢了
And if it antagonizes you, that's just a bonus.

261
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,050
Mary 很抱歉让你夹在中间这么为难了
Mary, I'm sorry you're in the middle of this.

262
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,020
不不 不用觉得抱歉
No, no, nothing to be sorry about.

263
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,360
我真的很欣赏你的父亲
I genuinely like your father.

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,090
什么? 但他只是个中等水平的学者啊
What? But he's a mediocre academic.

265
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,500
而且根据Beverly的话来看 他的性能力还达不到一般水平
And according to Beverly, his sexual prowess is subpar.

266
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,900
他最多是Leonard的成人版
He's basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.

267
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,710
你是在说我父亲配不上你母亲吗?
Are you saying that my dad's not good enough for your mom?

268
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,970
是啊 顺便连你一起损了
Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you.

269
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,410
效率可观吧?
Pretty efficient, huh?

270
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,710
这实在是太荒谬了 我去对面了
This is ridiculous. I... I'm going across the hall.

271
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,550
为什么你可以走却把我留在这里
But why should you get to go and leave me here

272
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,550
对付你吵吵闹闹的父母?
with your bickering parents?

273
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,850
好啊 那你走吧!
Fine, then you go!

274
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,950
我也不想和她一起呆在这里 我也走
Well, I don't want to stay here with her. I'll go.

275
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,990
我和你一起
I'll go with you.

276
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,090
那我还是得和这货呆在一起啊
That still leaves me here with him.

277
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,690
慢着 慢着!
Hang on, hang on!

278
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,230
大家都是文化人 这个问题能解决的
We're smart, we can figure this out.

279
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,700
Mary和Beverly不能共存
Mary and Beverly can't be together.

280
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,770
Alfred和Beverly也不能共存
Uh, Alfred and Beverly can't be together.

281
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,270
Leonard和我也不能共存
Leonard and I can't be together.

282
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,070
我可以和Alfred共存...
Now, I could be with Alfred...

283
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,540
但我一看他的脸就来气
but I don't like his face.

284
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,710
有了! 我算出来了!
Oh, here! I've got it!

285
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,410
大家准备好参加婚礼了吗?
Who's ready for a wedding?

286
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,550
真是够了 现在又要从头来过了
Great, now I have to start all over.

287
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,340
你在那个制药公司的待遇怎么样?
So how's the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?

288
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,970
很不错啊 我的业务地盘
Pretty good. I actually just got assigned

289
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,370
刚换了块更好的
a much better territory.

290
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,110
看到努力工作的结果了?
See what happens when you work hard?

291
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,250
她只是个卖药的 我可是要制作啊
Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make 'em.

292
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,920
够了 到此为止
Okay, that's enough.

293
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,650
谁也不准再说毒品的事了
No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.

294
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,020
说得好 干杯
I'll drink to that.

295
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,990
你还没喝够吗?
Haven't you had enough?

296
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,590
Penny喝得比我多得多
Penny drinks more than I do.

297
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,090
虎父无犬女嘛
Well, I learned from the best.

298
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,760
碰一个! 
Aw! Aw!

299
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,330
好样的 Wyatt

303
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:42,970
为什么你非得去坐牢?

304
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,180
谁让我被抓了呢 妈妈!
It's called getting caught, Mother!

305
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,910

322
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,550

你和我 两年了我们都没牵过手
You and I, we didn't even hold hands for two years.

328
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:49,410
为什么他不肯说找你去是什么事?

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,970
肯定是坏消息
It has to be bad news.

冷静点 好么? 不要想了

你这建议也太蠢了
That's really stupid advice.

332

你说这话很伤我心
You know that hurts my feelings.

哦 得了吧 最坏的结果是什么?
Oh, come on. What's the worst that could come of this meeting?

而我什么都拿不到

339
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,600
好了 那其实没有很糟
Okay, that's not so bad.

340

你知道参加曼哈顿计划的科学家

政府逼着他们搬到了沙漠

这个故事你是想说什么?
What's the point of that story?

我刚读了一本讲奥本海默的书
I just read a book about Oppenheimer,

348
