1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:07,006
Hey, I read that someone invented
a way to convert your footsteps...

2
00:00:07,173 --> 00:00:10,592
...into electromagnetic energy so you can
charge your cell phone while walking.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,846
We had that idea years ago.
How come we never did anything with it?

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,851
Because we left the diagram of it in the
restaurant and none of us wanted to walk back.

5
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,605
I know the real reason
you never made progress with that idea.

6
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,859
You thought of it September 22nd, 2007.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,194
Two days later, Penny moved in...

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:33,365
...and so much blood rushed to your genitals
your brain became a ghost town.

9
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,202
That's not what happened.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,124
I remember it distinctly because I had just
composed my annual poem commemorating...

11
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,461
- ...the anniversary of Dr. Seuss' death.
- No one wants to hear it.

12
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,962
Why, die?

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,213
Why did he die?

14
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,842
Old, told
I was told he was old

15
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,137
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

16
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:59,475
Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been
your greatest accomplishments?

17
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,561
Easy. Sleeping with Penny.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,355
Getting Penny to go out with him
after she dumped him.

19
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,649
Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

20
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,652
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

21
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,990
I think someone owes me an apology.

22
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,576
Well, don't feel bad.

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,246
I think we've all been distracted
since the girls entered our lives.

24
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,666
- You admit Amy's a distraction?
- Oh, very much so.

25
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,669
Listen to this. This is from two days ago.

26
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,506
"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

27
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,716
Who has time for this constant sexting?

28
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,012
Maybe we have lost our focus.

29
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,849
It wouldn't kill us to get together
and brainstorm ideas.

30
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,352
Ooh. We could have one of those retreats.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,853
Like our own science retreat.

32
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:49,191
- My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
- I'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

33
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,611
Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?

34
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,863
- Then we'll go to a hotel.
- A hotel?

35
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,157
Did you see The Shining?

36
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,953
We could go up to Big Bear,
get a house on the lake.

37
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,372
Did you see The Lake House?

38
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,958
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

39
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,627
Well, no, not to them. To me.

40
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,879
Time-traveling mailbox.

41
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,675
The only time that traveled was
an hour and a half of my life down the toilet.

42
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:18,137
- Fine. We'll stay here and do it.
- You didn't suggest a beach house.

43
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,682
- You would go to a beach house?
- Well, good Lord, no. Have you seen Jaws?

44
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,918
- Hey.
- Hey.

45
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,755
So the guys and I are talking about
having a science retreat this weekend.

46
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,259
I wanted to know if that's okay.
You and I talked about going to brunch.

47
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,179
- Wanna go to Vegas this weekend?
- Of course I do.

48
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,681
- Bernadette, girl's weekend, Vegas. You in?
- Yeah.

49
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,601
- Yes. I'll check flights.
- I'll check hotels.

50
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:09,188
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited I think I peed.

51
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,989
They seem okay with it.

52
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,621
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,623
- I didn't think you'd make it.
- Why not?

54
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,291
You have a steady girlfriend now.

55
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,003
We assumed you'd have to stay home
to lower the food down to her in the pit.

56
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,802
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

57
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,805
One would assume
on getting out of the pit.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,642
Okay, let's focus.

59
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,811
The girls are gone, we have 48 hours,
there are no distractions.

60
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,564
- Let's change the world.
- Thinking caps on.

61
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,233
- Here we go.
- Ooh. This is exciting.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,110
We're innovating.
I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

63
00:03:57,278 --> 00:04:00,614
- Oh. I never saw that.
- Really?

64
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,701
It's wonderful. And I swear I'm not saying that
because Justin Timberlake is in it.

65
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,829
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

66
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,164
We should watch it.

67
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,501
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

68
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,214
Guys, in 30 seconds we went from
"Let's change the world" to "Let's watch TV."

69
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,051
I'm sorry, is that a no?

70
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,639
Leonard's right. We're here to focus.
Didn't we used to have a list of all our ideas?

71
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,349
I think I still have it.

72
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,978
I did not get a clear answer.
I'm gonna set this down now.

73
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,772
Ah. Here it is.

74
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,107
Heh. Whoa.

75
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,442
I haven't looked at these in years.

76
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,238
- "Robot girlfriend."
- Mmm. That was mine.

77
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,574
"Robot prostitute."

78
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,119
Also mine.

79
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,873
I'm confused. Why would you need
both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?

80
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,002
There's just some things you don't do
with your robot girlfriend.

81
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,633
Boy, when you met Bernadette,
the field of robotics really took a hit.

82
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,680
Okay, let's just skip all the inventions
you can have sex with.

83
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,396
Here we go.

84
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:19,109
- "Ergonomic heated seat cushion."
- It vibrates. Keep going.

85
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,031
Know what?
Let's just come up with something new.

86
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:28,076
You know, a number of significant innovations
have been inspired by science fiction.

87
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,204
The geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

88
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,082
The Motorola flip phone,
that came from Star Trek.

89
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,878
And I have long suspected that the idea
of an African-American president...

90
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,298
...was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.

91
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,636
Hey, the future they show
in Back to the Future II...

92
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:50,849
...is only a year away. A lot of things
in that movie haven't been invented yet.

93
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,685
How cool would it be
if we could make one of those?

94
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,022
If we could figure out the scientific basis
for Marty's hoverboard...

95
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,399
...that would have universal application.

96
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:04,446
It's possible at absolute zero, but we would
have to remove the temperature restrictions.

97
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,032
- Oh, I have an idea.
- I think I have the same one.

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,992
We gottawatch Back to the Future II.

99
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,705
I'll make the popcorn.

100
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,377
- So where should we go first?
- Ooh.

101
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,754
- There's a cover band in the lounge.
- Nah.

102
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,964
- But they play Barry Manilow.
- No.

103
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,842
But they're called Fairly Manilow.

104
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,887
- Oh, okay.
- Great.

105
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,806
No.

106
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,725
- Well, what do you wanna do?
- Well, we're in Vegas.

107
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,269
I wanna go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas...

108
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:41,483
...dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel
and watch it go everywhere.

109
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,693
- What if we don't wanna vomit?
- Oh, you will.

110
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,737
That's why they give you the bucket.

111
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,158
- Uh-oh. It's my boss.
- What?

112
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:53,495
- They moved my field ride up to Monday.
- What does that mean?

113
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,832
It means instead of having a week to study,
I only have two days.

114
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,584
- That sucks.
- Can you start in the morning?

115
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,005
It's kind of a lot. Let me do a little tonight
and I'll catch up with you later.

116
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,216
- You sure?
- Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

117
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:12,848
- So, uh, now that Penny's not coming... Okay.
- We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.

118
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,940
Okay, wait. Hold on. Pause.

119
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,942
Something doesn't make sense. Look.

120
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:28,780
In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac...

121
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,869
...and takes the time machine back to 1955
to give it to his younger self.

122
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,372
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future...

123
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,376
...so the 2015 he returns to
would be a different 2015...

124
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,795
...not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

125
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,590
This is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again.

126
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,972
If future Biff goes back to 2015
right after he gives young Biff the almanac...

127
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,058
...he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

128
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:03,690
Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday
that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

129
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,318
- Whoa. Is "placed" right?
- What do you mean?

130
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,654
Is "placed" the right tense
for something that would have happened...

131
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,742
...in the future of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

132
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,704
"Had will have placed"?

133
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,081
That's my boy.

134
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,836
Okay, so it wasn't until his 21 st birthday...

135
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,423
...that Biff "had will have placed"
his first bet and made his millions.

136
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,926
That's when he altered the timeline.

137
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,470
Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it.

138
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,099
What?

139
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:42,229
Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,
this couldn't be more simple.

140
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,274
When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,
the alternate future he creates...

141
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:50,820
...isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown
ever use the time machine to travel to 2015.

142
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,367
Therefore, in the new timeline,
Marty and Doc never brought the time ma...

143
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,744
Wait, is "brought" right?

144
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,127
Marty and Doc never
"had have had brought"?

145
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,422
I don't know, you did it to me.

146
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,467
Yeah. I'm going with it.

147
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,763
Marty and Doc never "had have had"
brought the time machine to 2015.

148
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,890
That means 2015 Biff...

149
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:23,728
...could also not "had have had"
brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

150
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,358
Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff
gets the almanac...

151
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,779
...is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff
never gets the almanac.

152
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,239
And not just never gets.

153
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,368
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

154
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,792
He's right.

155
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,421
Also, what kind of name is Biff?

156
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,174
Sounds like when you pop open a can
of Pillsbury dough.

157
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,593
Biff.

158
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,306
Oh, ho. That stuff is so good
wrapped around cocktail weenies.

159
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,516
- Guys.
- Do you know that the word "wiener"...

160
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,020
...comes from the German name
of the Austrian capital Vienna, or "Wien"?

161
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,690
Do you know if you look at Austria on a map
it actually looks like a wiener?

162
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,819
Guys, what are we doing?
We sent the girls away so we could focus.

163
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,822
I don't think it worked.

164
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:31,046
Maybe after this,
you'll be in the mood for some Manilow.

165
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,382
I think after this, I'll be dead.

166
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,386
Look at us.
Out while Penny's in the room studying.

167
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,557
I'm proud of her. This is a great opportunity.
It's nice to see her take it seriously.

168
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,394
It is. But enough about Penny,
let's talk about us.

169
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,688
We're looking good.

170
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,484
- We are. Heh.
- Better than good.

171
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,904
I mean, look at you. Your body's banging.

172
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,281
- Amy.
- Don't "Amy" me.

173
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,702
We're always talking about how hot Penny is.
Come on, scientist to scientist...

174
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,081
...how big are those Hadron Colliders?

175
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,960
- You're embarrassing me.
- Oh, don't be embarrassed.

176
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,797
I'll show you the divot in my spine.

177
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,257
- What?
- No, no, it's okay, I was born with it.

178
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:20,470
If you put a double-A battery in there,
it makes my leg kick.

179
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:24,849
All right.

180
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,520
Oh, this is already better.
There are far fewer distractions in here.

181
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,606
Plus this is where our minds
are conditioned to focus on work.

182
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:36,111
So I've been thinking about the hoverboards,
and maybe we could use maglev technology.

183
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:40,573
Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the
materials, we could utilize quantum coupling.

184
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,492
Oh, I wonder if anyone's tried that.

185
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,952
Go online and look it up.

186
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,913
I can't argue with him.
It's right there on the screen.

187
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,083
Austria does look like a wiener. Heh.

188
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,838
That's nothing, dude.
Go check out how hung Florida is.

189
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:01,177
I'm sure Mrs. Florida's walking funny.
Can we get back to work?

190
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,722
He's right.

191
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,557
Oh, here's a thought.

192
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,018
What if we use some form
of operant conditioning techniques...

193
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,895
...to keep us from getting off topic?

194
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,065
- Like behavior modification?
- Exactly.

195
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:19,070
Did you know those techniques were used
to actually teach pigeons to play Ping-Pong?

196
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,030
That cannot be true.

197
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,793
Hey, it was match point.

198
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:38,548
Some psychologists perform
operant conditioning with punishment.

199
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,843
Maybe we can come up with a punishment
for straying off topic.

200
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:46,389
Not getting to see who wins
at pigeon Ping-Pong comes to mind.

201
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:51,102
We could snap a rubber band on our wrists
every time we get sidetracked.

202
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,189
Not bad. You know, in medieval times...

203
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:58,026
...idle chatter was punished
with a device called the scold's bridle.

204
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:03,698
It's an iron cage that's locked around the head
and pierces the tongue.

205
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:06,701
If only we had one.

206
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,039
Oh, I'll check Amazon.

207
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,670
Housekeeping.

208
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:24,636
We got a complaint about somebody
pooping on a party in there.

209
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,766
It was us the whole time.

210
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,354
- Why'd you tell her? It was working.
- Was it working?

211
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,731
Yeah.

212
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,567
Oh. I'm so sorry.

213
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,403
You guys look like you're having fun.

214
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,405
We're having the best time.

215
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,368
Guess who won $100 playing craps.

216
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,953
That's a dollar.

217
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,498
Then guess who wildly overtipped
a cocktail waitress.

218
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,125
Hey, Penny, let's go.

219
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,712
We found a place
that has Australian male strippers.

220
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,591
We wanna see if they twirl their junk
in the other direction.

221
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:17,605
That sounds so great,
but I have a little more studying to do.

222
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:20,233
Ugh. Can you believe this nerd?

223
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,279
Do you wanna sit here being a loser...

224
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,198
...or do you wanna watch me climb
into an Australian man's G-string...

225
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,617
...like a baby kangaroo?

226
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,127
All right. Guys, look. I would love to go out,
but I've gotta get this done.

227
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,964
Okay? So have fun at the club.
And if you get in trouble, find a policeman.

228
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,968
And if he's taking off his pants,
he is not a real policeman.

229
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,555
Okay, okay.
This is obviously very important to her.

230
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,892
Let's just... We'll help her study
so she can get done quicker.

231
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,520
Here. Here, I'm gonna quiz you.
I'm gonna quiz you.

232
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,565
I got your notes.

233
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,817
I got your notes. I got your notes.

234
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,529
If you want these,
they're gonna be at the strip club.

235
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:12,243
- Aren't you gonna chase her?
- To the walk-in closet? Sure.

236
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,502
Okay, so we agree.

237
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,090
Whenever someone takes us off topic
they get their arm hair yanked off.

238
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,720
I can't let that happen or the girl who does my
eyebrows will think I've been cheating on her.

239
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:35,099
All right, now,
one benefit of quantum coupling...

240
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,144
Question. Who decides
if someone's gone off topic?

241
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:42,357
I think it'll be pretty clear.
If not, we'll take a vote. Oh, and also...

242
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,108
Ow!

243
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,322
- We didn't vote.
- We didn't have to. That was clearly a tangent.

244
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,784
Now, come on. Back to work.
If we're leaning towards quantum coupling...

245
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,994
Ow! Why?

246
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,831
You said quantum coupling. That made me
think of the show Quantum Leap.

247
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,542
That's a tangent and it's your fault.

248
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,462
That's ridiculous. I vote that is not a tangent.

249
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,506
Yeah, thank you.
And now I owe you one.

250
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,049
Ow!

251
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,884
That was your fault.

252
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,386
Hey!

253
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,471
Oh, hoo-hoo. That is a lot of hair.

254
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,307
Ow!

255
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,394
And now I'm gonna hear it from Jenny.

256
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,563
Everyone, stop. This was a stupid idea.

257
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,857
Negative reinforcement isn't working.

258
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,859
I think you mean "positive punishment."

259
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,154
Negative reinforcement
is the removal of a positive stimulus.

260
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,572
It's a common mistake.

261
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,866
"Negative reinforcement" is really wrong?

262
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,660
It's used incorrectly all the time.

263
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,330
Even Bill Murray makes that mistake
in the first scene of Ghostbusters.

264
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,792
No way. Not Bill Murray.

265
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,463
I'm studying the effect
of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.

266
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,967
Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.

267
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,179
- Jump to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
- No.

268
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,348
Leonard's right.

269
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,394
We can't just jump ahead.
We have to watch the whole movie.

270
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,688
We keep procrastinating.

271
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,524
We saw Back to the Future II,
pigeons playing Ping-Pong...

272
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,609
...countries that looked like genitals...

273
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,030
...and one guy whose genitals
looked like Denmark.

274
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,991
Yeah, sorry for clicking on that.

275
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,870
It's late. We've wasted hours.

276
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,373
Can we please find it in ourselves
to do any amount of work tonight?

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,710
But we didn't see them bust one ghost.

278
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:31,966
So you're saying we should stand here,
in my lab, on a Saturday night...

279
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,761
...and watch the rest of Ghostbusters
on a crappy laptop?

280
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,304
No.

281
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,514
MAN
When there's something strange

282
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,808
In the neighborhood

283
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,226
Who you gonna call?

284
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,729
ALL
Ghostbusters

285
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,606
When there's something weird...

286
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,566
It really does hold up.

287
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,953
See? Isn't this better than a hotel room?

288
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,040
Yep. Shake that thing.

289
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,252
Have you ever seen a body so fine?

290
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,922
We had some pretty hot corpses
in my anatomy class...

291
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,257
...but none of them moved like that.

292
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,188
Good morning.

293
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,731
You wanna go to the pool?

294
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,362
Come on. You said it yourself.

295
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,115
Only nerds and losers stay in the room.

296
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,995
Wow, it's bright out. Isn't it bright?

297
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,165
I should probably close these curtains.
Nah. Bye.

298
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,211
Would you please close the drapes?

299
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,130
Okay.
