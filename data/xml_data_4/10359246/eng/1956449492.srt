2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,679
They pumped my stomach.

3
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,139
I'm not paying for that.

4
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:15,932
Not when a good burp
would've saved you.

00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,933
NAOMI:
<i>I've known for some time</i>

6
00:00:17,016 --> 00:00:18,601
about Karl's indiscretions.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,770
I was picking up
my dry cleaning,

8
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,231
and there was his car,
parked across the street

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,983
at some seedy motel.

10
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,151
You still want
to make love to me?

11
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,861
- Yeah.
- I'm free today at 4:00.

12
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:28,820
Where should we go?

13
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,072
You're a man now;
figure it out.

14
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:36,035
There's no way I'm getting
into your mobile sex den.

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,498
You seem, uh... energized.

16
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,958
Do I?

17
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,210
Have you embarked on
a new exercise regimen?

18
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,131
I plan on working out
as often as I can.

ELI: <i>The other day,
she was going on and on</i>

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,133
<i>about how much
she liked my movie.</i>

21
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,594
You know what? We've already
got an open marriage...

22
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,053
I'll ask her for a three-way.

23
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,638
If she says no...

24
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,974
She says yes.

25
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,476

29
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,607
No.

He was bored with his wife.

SHEILA: It's a manual.
For married couples.

35
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,657
These are dirty pictures.

36
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,784
They're scientific.

37
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,869

I need to make an appearance.

42
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,132

It begins quite slowly.

64
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,381
With a look.

65
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,216
Or a gesture.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,635
And once the invitation
is accepted...

67
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,597
The tango begins.

68
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,770
It is a dance of anticipation.

69
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,149
- Seduction.
- Desire.

70
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,194
And love.

71
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,414
You know, some say
it takes two to tango.

72
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:30,793
But sometimes,
lurking in the dark...

73
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,670
Is a third.

74
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,976
Now, if you choose
to dance with him,

75
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,646
be prepared to deal
with the consequences.

76
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,316
For passion can
turn to jealousy.

77
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,027
Love can become violent.

78
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,830
Yes. The tango exists
to remind us

79
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,500
the greatest love stories...

80
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,337
End in death.

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,588
(gasping)

82
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,348
Just a reminder,

83
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,642
I've got that project
due tomorrow.

84
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,686
So you'll be working late again?

85
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,979
Afraid so.

86
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,731
Sorry, honey.

87
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,567
What are your big
plans for the day?

88
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,320
Oh, nothing interesting.

89
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,073
Need to drop by
the dry cleaners.

90
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,952
After that, I'll go
to the market for some shopping.

91
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,038
And then I might have lunch
with a new friend.

92
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,336
This is your phone number.

93
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,671
Oh, I thought
you should have it,

94
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,006
now that we're getting
to be chums.

95
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,008
This way,
if you ever need someone

96
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,342
to go with you to the movies...

97
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,177
I can call you up. Got it.

98
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,056
Now, I rent a room
from a lovely couple.

99
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,725
The wife's name

100
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,059
is also Sheila.

101
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,394
- Oh.
- So,

102
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,271
if you call and she answers...

103
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,064
Then I'll ask
for the other Sheila.

104
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,025
Exactly. Busy this week?

105
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:20,611
Uh, my schedule is pretty open,
except for tonight.

106
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,740
I have a date.
(laughs)

107
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,409
With your married man?

108
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,703
He finished some big project
at work. To celebrate,

109
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,415
he got us reservations
at this really fancy night club.

110
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,084
He's taking you out?

111
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,919
In public?

112
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,256
For the first time.
It's like an actual boyfriend.

113
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:41,466
(laughs)

114
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,801
Isn't that nice?

115
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,803
(kissing, moaning)

116
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,055
(laughs)

117
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,264
(chuckles)

118
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,640
What are you smiling about?

119
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,142
Oh, the absurdity of it all.

120
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,894
I'm having the best sex
of my life

121
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,563
in the back of a catering van.

122
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,275
Well, maybe when Mr. Grove
moves out,

123
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:02,320
we could start
doing this in your bed.

124
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,946
Yes...

125
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,948
So, about that...

126
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:11,037
Karl may be staying in my home
longer than we discussed.

127
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,293
How much longer? A week?

128
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,128
Longer.

129
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,130
Two weeks?

130
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,342
He won't be leaving until
after my daughter's wedding.

131
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,469
(stammers)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

132
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,012
(chuckles)

133
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,514
That's two months away.

134
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,433
Well, I don't mind the van.

135
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,768
No, that's-that's not the point.

136
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,813
Simone, he cheated
on you with men.

137
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,648
Why would you let him stay
for five more seconds?

138
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,525
Well, I tried to throw him out.

139
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,069
- And he wouldn't go?
- He said that if I made him leave,

140
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,904
he would tell all my
friends he was gay

141
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,156
and embarrass me
before the wedding.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,616
So he's threatening you?

143
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:52,328
No, it's just
a little light blackmail.

144
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,999
All right.
I'll take care of this.

145
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,001
What does that mean?

146
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,505
Nothing. I'm just gonna convince
him that he's making a mistake.

147
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,132
(gasps)
That's adorable.

148
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,341
Hey, I'm serious.

149
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,009
Please, let me help.

150
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,303
Absolutely not.

151
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,055
I'm not gonna break any bones.

152
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,143
I'm just gonna
bend some stuff.

153
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:18,813
Tommy, how do you expect our
secret affair to remain secret

154
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,356
once you've been
arrested by the police

155
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,358
for beating up my husband?

156
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,193
I was just spitballing.

157
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,612
Well, I appreciate
the passion,

158
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,448
but save it for the van.

159
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,037
I'd still love
to meet Karl alone

160
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,831
in a dark alley some night.

161
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,541
Careful.

162
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,460
He might enjoy that.

163
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,304
Yes. Um, no, I understand,

164
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,723
it's just that I've been through
the deposition twice

165
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,641
and I couldn't
find anything useful.

166

- Oh, hey.
- Yes.

169
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,233
I will check again.

Got it this morning.
It's pretty sweet, right?

Yeah, no, honey, this is a bass.

You've dazzled them all

365

366

They'd laugh in my face if

367

Here's a thought.
Don't tell them.

- Trust me,

372

here tonight

373

all of her problems for yours

But what good is

00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,098
Yes, I'm forever
flouting my knowledge

537
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,017
that Spain is in Europe.

538
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,477
SANDY:
Naomi,

539
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,103
can I just say I'm stunned

540
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,938
at how handsome
your son's become.

541
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,316
I'm stunned he can
breathe in those pants.

542
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,320
Karl...

543
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,072
you're making
Tommy uncomfortable.

544
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,115
Me? I'm not the one
who dressed him up

545
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,576
as a backup dancer
to Liza Minnelli.

546
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,119
Another scotch,
please, young man.

547
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,121
Yes, Mr. Grove.

548
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,498
Very good.
Thank you.

549
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,625
(giggles) Hurry back, Tommy.

550
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,170
Can you believe how she's
flirting with my son?

551
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,963
Oh, Sandy is just being playful.

552
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:05,008
He's 18. She's 32.

553
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,678
Don't you think
that's pathetic?

554
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,599
Excuse me.

555
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,727
Vodka rocks, please.

556
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,687
You have to switch tables.

557
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,980
I can't.

558
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,273
Then at least
stop glaring at Karl.

559
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,650
He's such a jerk.

560
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,943
He's just trying
to be funny.

561
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,569
He's insulting
your dignity.

562
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:28,323
You can't say that
in those sleeves.

563
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,616
Ah, vodka rocks.

564
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:33,411
Thank you. Mmm.

565
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,705
You've found
your calling.

566
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,419
(dance music playing)

567
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,671
Hey!

568
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,172
There you are.

569
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,842
- Here I are.
- Why aren't you dancing?

570
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,510
I'm tired.

571
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,846
- Are you about ready to go?
- Now?

572
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,098
- Yeah.
- I'm having so much fun with Wischa.

573
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,017
TAYLOR: Well,
it's after midnight,

574
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,477
and I got to
be up early

575
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,187
and go to my job

576
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:03,400
that requires me to, you know,
wear clothes, so...

577
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,862
How many of those
have you had?

578
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,572
A couple.

579
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,658
Maybe two couples.

580
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,410
You seem angry.

581
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,370
I'm not angry.

582
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:18,874
Unless you're going to Venice
with those low-rent Kardashians.

583
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,835
Hey. Taylor, be nice.

584
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,211
Those are my friends.

585
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,172
Yeah, and I'm just
the person who saved you

586
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,550
from an abusive relationship
and let you live in my house,

587
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,594
but fuck me, right?

588
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,890
Okay. Um, I think maybe
you should go home,

589
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,933
and I will...

590
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,060
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

591
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:42,355
- Okay?
- Yeah.

592
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,566
Hey.

593
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,277
Are you going to Venice?

594
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,572
I don't know yet.

595
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,742
Fine. Go!

596
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,702

Rob.

You sound upset.

604
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,264
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

605
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,225
did you happen to move
any papers?

606
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,935
What are you talking about?

607
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,519
The final draft
of the Delphi Project.

608
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,772
It was here on my desk
and now it's gone.

609
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,774
Did you look under your desk?

610
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,442
Yes, I've looked everywhere.

Now, this is
incredibly important.

Are you sure
you didn't touch it?

613
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,407
I know better than
to touch your things.

614
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,159
Damn it.

615
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:39,287
If I don't find this thing, I'll
have to stay late and redo it,

616
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,289
the whole goddamn thing.

617
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,458

working late anyway.

Uh... that was on

You're talking to her.
Who's this?

I think I mean your roommate,
the other Sheila.

from the diner.

is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.

Hm. I thought she might.

Hi. I know this is late notice,

but would you like to come
with me to the club tonight?

638
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,820
Rob cancelled on me.

I'm a mess
right now, but

640
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,033
I guess I could
throw myself together.

641
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:58,950
Oh, good.

It's the White Diamond Bar

- What's going on?
- Show some respect, kids.

646
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,253
You're in the presence
of greatness.

647
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,673
TOMMY:
Careful, everybody.

648
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:14,883
- These bowls are hot.
- Ooh!

649
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,426
Tortilla soup.

650
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,887
You can't say this isn't
"South of the Border." (laughs)

651
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,347
Given Simone's grasp
of geography,

652
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,057
I'm surprised we're
not having clam chowder.

653
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,726
- (laughter)
- (glass clinking)

654
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,519
By the way,

655
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,397
have you all heard the latest
news about Larry and Sue?

656
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,565
What about them?

657
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,233
(whispering):
They've separated.

658
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,944
- (gasps) No!
- Are you really that surprised?

659
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,404
They fought constantly.

660
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,531
In my day, people stayed married

661
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,533
and found a way
to work things out.

662
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,744
Well, that's not
always possible.

663
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,412
NAOMI:
Simone's right.

664
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,706
People can care deeply
for one another,

665
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,625
it doesn't always mean that
they should stay married.

666
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,251
You see, this is where
I think commitment

667
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,253
becomes essential.

668
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,130
Everyone
makes mistakes,

669
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,049
but if love is there,

670
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,467
then there's a path
to redemption.

671
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,760
BARCLAY:
Easy for you to say.

672
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,762
You and Simone
have the perfect marriage.

673
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,222
Oh, hardly.

674
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,725
There are days
when Simone regrets marrying me.

675
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
Am I right,
my darling?

676
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,271
- More than a few. (laughs)
- Yes, I imagine she dreams

677
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,107
of stifling me
with a pillow

678
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,817
or casting me aside
like an old shoe.

679
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,944
Oh, honey, you know
I'd never throw away a shoe.

680
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,114
But you don't get rid of me that
easily. You see, she gave me

681
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,448
her hand in marriage.

682
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,826
- SIMONE: Karl...
- KARL: And I'm never

683
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,619
going to let it go.

684
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,996
- Oh!
- (gasps)

685
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,289
KARL:
Bloody hell!

686
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:29,749
Tommy, how could you
be so clumsy?

687
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,127
Sorry, Mr. Grove.

688
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,588
Let me get you some napkins.

689
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,010
Clearly, he did that on purpose.

690
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,012
No, he just wasn't
paying attention.

691
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:46,182
You know how
teenagers are.

692
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,484
- (groans)
- Okay, sober person, here we go.

693
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,153
Give me this.

694
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,363
Stop. Hey.
Eli, don't rush me.

695
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,991
I'm not rushing you. There.

696
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,661
You know what? I don't get it.

697
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:08,079
What's that?
What don't you get?

698
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,873
I don't get what Jade sees
in those people.

699
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,708
- Wischa?
- Yeah.

700
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,543
They're fake as shit.

701
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,004
Yes, they are.
Okay, legs, pants.

702
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,006
(groans)
And you know what?

703
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,800
Why would anyone want to see
them in their underwear?

704
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,010
Ugh.

705
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:24,679
'Cause they're not even
that pretty.

706
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,014
Do you think they're pretty?

707
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,558
Only their bodies
and their faces.

708
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:33,897
And now Jade's going with them
to Venice?

709
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,857
- Mm-hmm.
- Fuck her.

710
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,692
- (chuckles)
- What's funny?

711
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,362
You. You're funny 'cause
you're drunk and ridiculous,

712
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,864
and that's a nice
change of pace.

713
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,865
From what?

714
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,201
Well, usually you're the one
taking care of me

715
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,744
when I'm doing something stupid.

716
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,662
- I do take care of you.
- Yes, you do.

717
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,499
- I take care of everybody.
- Okay.

718
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,958
(sighs)

719
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,252
Hey, don't feel bad
in the morning, okay?

720
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,879
Why would I feel bad?

721
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,006
'Cause you'll remember
how rude you were to Jade.

722
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,885
Don't worry, she'll forgive you.

723
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,345
Mm, fuck you.

724
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,805
And so will I.

725
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,561
I am so happy you came.
You look amazing.

726
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,355
It was very kind
for you to invite me.

727
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,065
I never go to places
like this.

728
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,025
Well, if you hadn't come,
I would've had to stay home,

729
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,694
and where is
the fun in that?

730
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,696
(chuckles)

731
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,907
It's a shame your fella
couldn't make it.

732
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,701
Yeah, he said he had
to work late, but who knows?

733
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,079
Married men who cheat

734
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,747
also know how to lie.

735
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,917
It must be frustrating.

736
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,378
Never knowing if Rob

737
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,380
is going to stand you up
for his wife.

738
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,590
It can be annoying,

739
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,592
but it's a trade-off.

740
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,262
So what do you get
out of the deal?

741
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,556
Freedom.

742
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:50,974
See, I don't want
to get married.

743
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,102
So this is just a...

744
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,937
casual fling?

745
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,648
Yeah. Rob's wife will get him
back when I'm done with him,

746
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,899
good as new.

747
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,901
And if he keeps
working late,

748
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,112
it's going to be
in a couple of weeks.

749
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,282
Oh, good. For you.

750
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,617
I mean, good for you.

751
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,578
(chuckles)

752
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,580
Where is our waiter?

753
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,833
So, April, why don't you want
to get married?

754
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,919
Because I want to have a career.

755
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,755
Doing what?

756
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,967
I want to be a singer.

757
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,137
- Really?
- (chuckles)

758
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,973
That's kind of why
I wanted to come here.

759
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:34,183
They have girls that sing
with the combo on the weekends,

760
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:35,977
so I'm gonna introduce myself
to the manager,

761
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,940
and then I am going
to audition for him.

762
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,483
I had no idea you sang.

763
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,153
I started in the church choir
back at home.

764
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:46,988
Folks there think
I'm pretty talented.

765
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,325
I'm gonna be somebody someday.

766
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:53,119
You just watch.

767
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,042
I love music.

768
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,336
I used to play the piano.

769
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,378
No kidding.

770
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,963
Yeah, I took
lessons for years.

771
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,173
Well, do you
still play?

772
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,508
The truth is,

773
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:11,679
my husband didn't care
for my playing.

774
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,515
I made the mistake of telling
him I wanted to give a recital,

775
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,975
and he just laughed.

776
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,853
He said I wasn't as good
as I thought I was.

777
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,980
That sort of

778
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,524
took the wind out of my sail.

779
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,818
Oh, honey.

780
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,490
Your husband's dead.

781
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,159
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

782
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:41,542
Can I just say I am very happy
to be here tonight?

783
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,420
(laughs) Well, here's to us.

784
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,547
(giggles)

785
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,009
(clattering)

786
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,388
Taylor, what are you doing?

787
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,848
You were right.
I have to go find Jade.

788
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:58,101
It's 4:00 in the morning.

789
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,063
I was such a bitch,
and now she's going to Venice,

790
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:05,024
and it's all my fault,
and I have to fix this.

791
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,151
All right, well, you don't
even know where she is.

792
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,946
Yes, I do, okay?
I-I... She's at their hotel.

793
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,865
- How do you know that?
- I put Find My Friends on her phone.

794
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,618
- You're tracking her?
- I got to go.

795
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,287
(groans) Oh, my God.

796
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:21,749
Hey, what the fuck
has gotten into you?

797
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,292
I can't lose her.

798
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,378
Well, you can wait until
she gets home to talk to her.

799
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,921
What if she
doesn't come back?

800
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,923
What if she's already
on a plane to Venice

801
00:33:29,006 --> 00:33:30,091
and I never see her again?

802
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,884
You just said
she's at the hotel.

803
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,553
(sighs) I need her.

804
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,639
If she leaves, this whole
fucking thing falls apart.

805
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,975
(door closes)

806
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,270
No...

807
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,730
- (engine starts)
- No.

808
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,897
Stop the car.

809
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,276
What does that mean?

810
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,111
What whole thing falls apart?

811
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,612
Eli, get off.

812
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,447
No, you're gonna get out

813
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,614
and you're gonna
talk to me right now,

814
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,824
Taylor.

815
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,285
Really?

816
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,293
Just talk to me, Taylor.

817
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,921
What's going on?

818
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,423
Come on.

819
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,676
I asked you before
if you were in love with her.

820
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,011
I-I know, I know.

821
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,846
- You lied to me.
- Not exactly.

822
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,973
Then what the hell
are we doing in the driveway?

823
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:20,975
Eli, come on, please.

824
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,310
This is, this is too hard!

825
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,145
- What?
- I-I don't know.

826
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,065
- What?
- My life, my l... my life is so hard!

827
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,526
I-I... The hours I work,
the cases I take.

828
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,946
And then I come home
to this house.

829
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,658
This big, fucking house
that we can't afford!

830
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,327
And I have
to pay for it

831
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,246
because you haven't sold
a script in two years.

832
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,999
But I can't
bring that up

833
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:47,293
because then I'm a bitch.

834
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:50,213
So I say nothing.

835
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,803
And Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

836
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,180
'Cause she
doesn't take.

837
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,307
She only gives.

838
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,354
If she leaves,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

839
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:10,399
Why didn't you tell me
any of this before?

840
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,570
Come on.

841
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,697
I don't want to hurt you.

842
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,409
Oh, well, great call.

843
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,745
'Cause it hurts.

844
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,250
So, I mean...

845
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,085
Do you want me to go?

846
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,545
No.

847
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,171
Eli, I love you.

848
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,423
But you want her to stay.

849
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,555
I mean...

850
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,640
How does that even work?

851
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,811
I don't know.

852
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,938
I don't.

853
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,858
But it has to.

854
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,278
Because otherwise, it's just
too hard to be married to me.

855
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,740
No. Eli...

856
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,370
(door opens)

857
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,205
(sighs)

858
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,623
(door closes)

859
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,916
(indistinct chatter)

860
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,459
(lively music playing)

861
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,265
I got fired.

862
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,059
I'm not surprised.
What you did was childish.

863
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,770
- He was grabbing you.
- He was holding my hand.

864
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,272
- Why do you keep defending him?
- I'm not.

865
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,065
He's lied to you,
he's cheated on you

866
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,276
and he won't
leave your home.

867
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,236
The situation is complicated.

868
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
Well, yeah, it must be,
because it makes no sense.

869
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,616
- You should hate him.
- I know, I know, it's just...

870
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,784
He's my husband.

871
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:49,332
He puts up with my extravagance
and my nonsense.

872
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,629
He tells me I'm beautiful when I
need to hear it the most and...

873
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,798
he makes me laugh
in a way that no one else can.

874
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,592
Simone...

875
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,260
One day, I will divorce Karl,

876
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,304
but I will
never hate him,

877
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,015
because I can't.

878
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,937
Where does that leave me?

879
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,482
In the back of a van

880
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:17,318
having a marvelous time.

881
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,113
Yeah, well, van came
with the job, so...

882
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,698
Don't worry.

883
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,659
We'll figure it out.

884
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,829
Mrs. Grove.

885
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,790
Mrs. Harte says
it's time for your number.

886
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,875
Thank you.

887
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,132
I have to go.

888
00:37:45,262 --> 00:37:47,306

00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,651
Hi.

890
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:02,279
(whispers):
Hey.

891
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,410
Listen, about tonight,
I'm so sorry.

892
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,746
- You don't have to apologize.
- No, I do.

893
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,873
I really do.

894
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,794
Thank you.

895
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:23,467
So, I decided to go to Venice
with Mischa and Willow.

896
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,762
Oh.

897
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,725
JADE:
It's time.

898
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,728
Being here with you
and Eli, it's...

899
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:37,273
...starting to feel like a home.

900
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,942
I'm getting attached.

901
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,031
Which always leads
to me getting hurt.

902
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:49,410
When it ends. So...

903
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,830
I should go.

904
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,668
ELI: What if it
doesn't have to end?

905
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,129
What if you stayed?

906
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,381
What if this was your home?

907
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,261
Here with us.

908
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:09,221
(Jade stammers)

909
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,432
What are you saying?

910
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,601
Live with us.

911
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,694
Be with us.

912
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,655
Yeah.

913
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,116
There's no reason
to leave.

914
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,535
You just got home.

915
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:41,128
(door opens)

916
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,674
Hi.

917
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,093
Oh, you're still up.

918
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,928
Of course.

919
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:51,847
Did you get your work finished?

920
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,599
Yep.

921
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,977
I redid the whole project.
It took forever.

922
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,314
I could fix you
a snack if you like.

923
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:04,485
No. I'm gonna make myself
a martini, take a shower

924
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,487
and go to bed.

925
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,365
All right.

926
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,081
Would it bother you if I played
the piano for a bit?

927
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,000
It's after midnight.

928
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,752
I know. If you'd rather
I didn't...

929
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,214
Nah. Whatever you want.
