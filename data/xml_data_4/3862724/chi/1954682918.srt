1
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:04,317
Leonard 我在研究我们去加州大学伯克利分校
Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,859
演讲要用的开场笑话
for our lecture at Berkeley.

3
00:00:05,861 --> 00:00:07,030
笑话我爱听
Oh, I like to laugh.

4
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,535
除了你的 说吧
But say it anyway.

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,475
好的...
Okay, um...

6
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:14,142
对一名加州大学伯克利分校
What do you say to a graduate

7
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:16,416
物理系毕业的学生该说什么?
of the UC Berkeley physics department?

8
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,018
{\an8}讽刺他们要去快餐店工作

9
00:00:16,418 --> 00:00:19,018
配餐我要薯条
I'll have fries with that. 

10
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:21,996
因为他的专业并没有教会他
Because his education hasn't prepared him

11
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,862
在科学领域工作所需要的知识
for a career in the sciences.

12
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,703
要知道 他们追着你们打的时候
You know, when they chase you out of there,

13
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,400
你只需要比Sheldon跑得快就行
you only have to run faster than Sheldon.

14
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,476
行李都准备好了吗?
Are you all set for your trip?

15
00:00:31,478 --> 00:00:32,812
嗯 都准备好了
Yeah, I think so.

16
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:36,047
我给旧的PRK补了货
I just restocked the old PRK.

17
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:37,088
PRK是什么?
"PRK"?

18
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,584
公共厕所救急包
Public restroom kit.

19
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,327
一包在手 就不用为要去新的
Everything a boy needs for making pee pee

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:44,591
陌生厕所嘘嘘担心了
in new and strange places.

21
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:47,031
我实在看不出来带着装有厕纸
I don't see what's crazy about bringing a backpack

22
00:00:47,033 --> 00:00:49,366
和免洗消毒液的背包有什么奇怪的
with your own toilet paper and Purell.

23
00:00:49,368 --> 00:00:51,465
还有呢
Keep going.

24
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,244
还有橡皮手套 空气清新剂
And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener.

25
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:56,846
降噪耳机
Um, noise-cancelling headphones.

26
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,415
求救哨子
Oh, danger whistle.

27
00:00:58,417 --> 00:00:59,680
呃...
Um...

28
00:00:59,682 --> 00:01:00,985
胡椒喷剂
pepper spray.

29
00:01:00,987 --> 00:01:03,955
一块多语言"有人"牌子
Ooh, a multi-language "occupied" sign.

30
00:01:03,957 --> 00:01:05,364
再看看
Uh, let's see.

31
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,734
还有马桶垫 鞋套
We have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes,

32
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,799
夹鼻子用的晾衣夹
a clothespin for my nose.

33
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:14,104
还有长杆镜
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,

34
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,512
这样我就能确保隔壁厕所间的人
so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me

35
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:18,345
不是个变态了
isn't some kind of weirdo.

36
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:24,051
这样你还会担心伯克利有女生想抢走他吗?
You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?

37
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:27,662
当然 你以为是谁给他那个哨子的?
Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?

38
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:33,064
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

39
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:36,403
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

40
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,043
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

41
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:40,581
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

42
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:43,250
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

43
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:45,962
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

44
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:47,839
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

45
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:48,841

49
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,198
你想玩个我发明的行车物理游戏
Would you like to play a physics car game I invented

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,167
"视觉不发现"吗?
called "I Can't Spy"?

51
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:07,502
这款游戏继承了"视觉大发现"的紧张刺激
It's all the nail-biting tension of "I Spy"

52
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:10,502
还增加了次原子微粒 可视光谱外
but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves

53
00:02:10,504 --> 00:02:12,637
光波的乐趣
outside the visible spectrum.

54
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,205
只要这游戏
If it's half as much fun as

55
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:16,341
有"一乘以十的墙上第四瓶啤酒次方"一半有趣
"One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

56
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,014
我就玩
I'm in.

57
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:19,647
从我开始
I'll begin.

58
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:24,153
我小小的眼睛发现不了...
Uh, I can't spy with my little eye...

59
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,992
有什么穿过了我们的身体?
something passing right through us.

60
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,656
我喝的那杯豆奶星冰乐
That soy Frappuccino I had.

61
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:32,663
你能好好玩游戏吗?
Will you please play the game?

62
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,263
我小小的眼睛发现不了
I can't spy with my little eye

63
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,295
有什么穿过了我们?
something passing right through us.

64
00:02:37,297 --> 00:02:39,367
我不知道...
I don't know, um...

65
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,039
如果每秒每平方厘米的空间里
If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass

66
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,103
有650亿太阳中微子穿过
through a square centimeter every second,

67
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:46,144
由于这辆车的表面积
given the surface area of this car is

68
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,041
大约是6万平方厘米
about 60,000 square centimeters,

69
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:52,787
那答案是3.9乘以十的15次方个太阳中微子?
that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?

70
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:57,354
我不想玩了
I don't want to play anymore.

71
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,921
我们已经有段时间没有公路旅行了
We haven't been on a road trip in a while.

72
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,121
很有趣的
This is fun.

73
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,592
行了... 你赢了游戏
We get it... you won the game.

74
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:04,393
别炫耀了
Stop bragging.

75
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,563
听着 我们一起写了篇论文
No, listen, we wrote a paper together.

76
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,299
现在竟然被请去大学做讲座
Now we get to go to a university and talk about it?

77
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,803
那超厉害的
That's pretty cool.

78
00:03:10,669 --> 00:03:12,506
我想是的
I suppose it is.

79
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:17,042
事实上 如果你想来点音乐庆祝一下
In fact, if you'd like to celebrate with a little music,

80
00:03:17,044 --> 00:03:18,672
我完全同意
I'd be okay with that.

81
00:03:18,674 --> 00:03:21,508
什么...?
What...?

82
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:24,975
这次公路旅行简直嗨翻了
This road trip just got crazy.

83
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:28,202
来点黑人放克音乐 白小子
Play that funky music, white boy.

84
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:32,134
你竟然知道这首歌
I'm surprised you know that reference.

85
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:35,036
什么歌?
What reference?

86
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:41,036
我在要卖掉的东西上都贴了贴纸
So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.

87
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:42,898
只需要大家帮忙把东西搬到车道上
We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.

88
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,265
我可以负责定价吗?
Can I be in charge of pricing?

89
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:46,769
我经常去参加车库甩卖的
I've been going to garage sales my whole life.

90
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,043
信不信这条连裤袜我才花了五分钱?
Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?

91
00:03:50,646 --> 00:03:54,114
好啊 Amy就负责定价和扮老
All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75.

92
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,344
嘿 Penny 能帮我一起搬这个吗?
Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?

93
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,449
当然
Sure.

94
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,049
我小时候就有个球桌的
Aw, we had one of these growing up.

95
00:04:00,051 --> 00:04:01,520
我还一直玩呢
I used to play all the time.

96
00:04:01,522 --> 00:04:03,287
是吗? 我喜欢打乒乓球
Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.

97
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:05,517
我是说啤酒球
Oh, I meant beer pong.

98
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:05,517
{\an8}Beer pong: 丢球进酒杯 不然就罚喝酒的游戏

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,254
我也有个球桌
I had a table, too,

100
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,894
但我没朋友 所以我只能一直发球
but I didn't have any friends, so all I did was serve.

101
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:14,569
你可以翻起一边的桌子 然后和它对打
You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.

102
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,476
要是我有朋友 他们也许就会告诉我
And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.

103
00:04:20,046 --> 00:04:21,740
过来一下
Excuse me.

104
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,907
为什么这上面有贴纸?
Why is there a sticker on this?

105
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,715
{\an8} TARDIS 科幻剧"神秘博士"中的时间机器和宇宙飞船

106
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,715
这是我买的神秘博士里的时间机器
It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who.

107
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:27,748
我打算搬回家的
I was planning on moving it in the house.

108
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,021
我觉得你刚才就已经自问自答了
I think you just answered your own question.

109
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:33,989
拜托 总有一天它的价值会翻倍
Come on, one day, this may double in value

110
00:04:33,991 --> 00:04:36,662
能卖到我付出去的一半价格
and be worth half what I paid for it.

111
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,294
亲爱的 我们有很多事要做
Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

112
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:40,094
不用立刻决定要不要卖这个
We don't need to decide this right now.

113
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:43,068
只要你别固执己见一定要卖就好
Well, I guess as long as you're keeping an open mind.

114
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,933
当然
Of course.

115
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,893
所以... 他们要求
So... they're requesting

116
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,198
白小子放点放克音乐 对吧?
that the white boy play the funky music, yes?

117
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,167
对
Yes.

118
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,305
我们现在听的这个也是放克音乐?
And this music we're listening to right now is funky as well?

119
00:05:14,443 --> 00:05:16,480
没错
Sure.

120
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,143
那我问你
Let me ask you this.

121
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,614
你觉得
Do you think

122
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:24,247
这首曲子就是白小子最后放的吗?
this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?

123
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,024
也许是
It could be.

124
00:05:28,026 --> 00:05:31,590
所以这就像是音乐里的罗素悖论
So it's like the musical equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

125
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:34,261
问题是由所有不包含自身的集合
the question of whether the set of all sets

126
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:37,490
所组成的集合是否包含自己?
that don't contain themselves as members contains itself?

127
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:39,458
- 没错  - 好吧...
- Exactly.  - Well...

128
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,761
那我讨厌它
then I hate it.

129
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,065
音乐应该是纯粹的享受
Music should just be fun.

130
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,494
开得挺快的
Making great time.

131
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:48,630
应该很早就能到那
Gonna be there pretty early.

132
00:05:48,632 --> 00:05:50,270
我们的酒店房间能住吗?
Will our hotel room be ready?

133
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,636
可能不行
I doubt it.

134
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:54,235
你难道不担心在大厅里
Aren't you worried that sitting in the lobby

135
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:56,770
坐上很久可能会吸引
for a long period of time might attract the attention

136
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:59,504
酒店侦探的注意吗?
of the hotel detective?

137
00:05:59,506 --> 00:06:01,135
要是的话
If we do,

138
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:04,805
我们就告诉他"一边去 看见没?"
we'll just tell him to "hit the bricks, see?"

139
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:09,184
听着有些强硬 但 好吧
Seems a little confrontational, but all right.

140
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:13,049
其实我们离天行者庄园
You know, we won't be very far

141
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:14,458
也不是很远
from Skywalker Ranch.

142
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,322
这倒不假
Oh, that's true.

143
00:06:16,324 --> 00:06:18,226
但我们也进不去
It's not like we can get in there.

144
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,258
为什么?
Why not?

145
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,267
{\an8}星战导演

146
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,267
我... 我觉得George Lucas把总部
I... I don't think George Lucas put his headquarters

147
00:06:22,269 --> 00:06:25,333
建在一个偏僻的地方 应该不是希望有人拜访
in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.

148
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,604
尤达的沼泽不也很偏僻
Yoda's swamp was in the middle of nowhere.

149
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,604
{\an8}绝地尤达大师 "星球大战"人物

150
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,772
塔图因不也很偏僻
Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere.

00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,772
{\an8}塔图因: "星球大战" 中天行者家族的故乡行星

152
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,980
霍斯星球不也很偏僻
Hoth was in the middle of nowhere.

153
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,980
{\an8}霍斯星球: "星球大战"中的冰雪世界

154
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,949
这是暗号 Leonard
That's code, Leonard.

155
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,150
他想要我们拜访
He wants us to drop in.

156
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:42,918
我们的确有这时间
We do have time.

157
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,821
我们可以顺便开到那看一眼
I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.

158
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,955
太好了! 啊...
Yes! Oh...

159
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,595
我是如此兴奋
I'm so excited.

160
00:06:49,597 --> 00:06:51,994
简直无法自己
And I just can't hide it.

161
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,869
"哪怕即将失控 我也喜欢这样"
"I'm about to lose control, and I think I like it."

162
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:55,869
{\an8}美国歌手P!nk的I'm So Excited中的歌词

163
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,807
你在瞎说什么?
What are you talking about?

164
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,753
那你们俩决定几时搬来住?
So when do you guys think you're gonna move in?

165
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:10,690
我们还在考虑要做多少改造
We're still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.

166
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:12,723
要在"现代品味"
It's tricky finding the right balance

167
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:13,827
和"犹太老妈破烂堆"
between "tasteful modern"

168
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,690
之间做到平衡很难
and "Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest."

169
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,066
决定要怎么处理时光机了吗?
Have you made a decision about the TARDIS?

170
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:23,265
我觉得把它改名为"大型英式洗手间" 应该卖得出去
I think I can sell it if we call it, "Big British Porta-Potty."

171
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:28,304
我们不卖它... 它是我的
We're not selling it... it's mine.

172
00:07:28,306 --> 00:07:29,936
不能由你说了算
You can't just decide.

173
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,775
你我掰手腕决定怎么样?
How about I arm-wrestle you?

174
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,143
这不公平
That's not fair.

175
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:37,047
这好比我挑战你参加"性感裤子比赛"
It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.

176
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:39,743
你们可以打乒乓决胜负
You could play Ping-Pong for it.

177
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:41,352
就这么办吧
I would do that.

178
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,281
这怎么公平了?
How is that fair?

179
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,586
你从小就有个乒乓球桌
You grew up with a table.

180
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,058
是没错 可我一般都用它作
Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield

181
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,856
变形金刚和霹雳猫之间的战场
in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats

182
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,456
争夺我在林子里找到的胸罩
for control of a bra I had found in the woods.

183
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,602
Bernadette 为了报Leonard逼我看
Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who

184
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,930
每一集"神秘博士"的仇
Leonard has made me sit through,

185
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,202
我来替你比赛
I will play on your behalf

186
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,234
然后把那时光机送回Gallifrey
and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey,

187
00:07:58,204 --> 00:08:00,234
{\an8}Gallifrey "神秘博士"中时间领主们的母星

188
00:08:00,236 --> 00:08:02,202
可恶 我居然知道这一点
where I hate that I know it belongs.

189
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:04,808
没错 Penny替我比赛
Yes, Penny plays for me.

190
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,806
这不公平... 她上半身肌肉很发达
That's not fair... she has upper body muscles.

191
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:11,981
老兄 咱可是圣斯克里帝中学
Dude, three-time Sanskriti School

192
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:14,916
名门贵族羽毛球的三界冠军
for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.

193
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,714
没错... 就这样 Raj替我比赛
That's right... okay, Raj can play for me.

194
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:19,450
哦 你们刚刚分别选了英雄
Ooh, you just chose champions.

195
00:08:19,452 --> 00:08:21,417
感觉咱们就像在重演德国古老的
It's like we're reenacting the ancient German practice

196
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,321
- 格斗审判的传统  - 没错 还真像是
-  of trial by combat.  - Yeah, it's also like

197
00:08:23,323 --> 00:08:25,690
"权力的游戏"里魔山和红毒蛇的那场决斗
when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.

198
00:08:25,692 --> 00:08:27,458
Leonard还逼你看那个了?
Leonard makes you watch that, too?

199
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,994
没有 是我自己喜欢看
No, no, I like that show.

200
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,826
里面有龙 和激情片段
It's got dragons and people doing it.

201
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,128
那就这么定了
So it's settled.

202
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:35,697
神秘博士的时光机的命运将由一场
The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will be decided

203
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:38,232
受"权力的游戏"启发的生死决斗决定
by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield

204
00:08:38,234 --> 00:08:41,336
场地是变形金刚大战霹雳猫的战场
of ThunderCats versus Transformers.

205
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:44,640
那胸罩还在的话 我愿意花5分钱买
If you still have that bra, I'll give you a nickel for it.

206
00:08:50,346 --> 00:08:53,708
这就到了
There it is.

207
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,683
只是扇大门
It's just a gate.

208
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:59,681
在马路中间
On a road.

209
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,849
没费多大劲就找到了
Wasn't even that hard to find.

210
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,017
真是太棒了!
This is so amazing!

211
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,889
对啊!
I know!

212
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,457
你想拍张照吗?
You want to get a picture?

213
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,992
我不止要拍照
I want more than a picture.

214
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:13,256
我还要进去
I want to go in.

215
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:14,960
这个 我也想 不过他们不会肯的
Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

216
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:18,432
你就是靠这态度追到Penny的?
Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?

217
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,303
不是 但我又没有三年的时间
No, but I don't have three years

218
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:22,638
来让那扇大门觉得对不起我
to make that gate feel sorry for me.

219
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,502
呃 那里有个传话扬声器
Uh, there's a speaker box.

220
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:30,006
开上前去 按下按键 看看会怎么样
Drive up, push the button, and let's see what happens.

221
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,477
好吧 没错
Okay, yeah.

222
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,108
试试又有何妨?
What do we have to lose?

223
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,524
我有点紧张
I'm a little nervous.

224
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:47,157
那就克服它
Well, get over it.

225
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,830
遇到这种情况 关键要自信
Confidence is key in these situations.

226
00:09:49,832 --> 00:09:51,695
说得对
Right.

227
00:09:52,834 --> 00:09:55,370
你按了... 你是疯了吗?!
You pushed it... are you out of your mind?!

228
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,875
需要帮忙吗?
May I help you?

229
00:09:57,877 --> 00:09:58,939
呃...
Um...

230
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:01,148
呃... 我们没有预约
Uh, uh... we don't have an appointment,

231
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,381
也... 也不该来这
and... and we don't belong here,

232
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,685
但我们... 我们是狂热粉丝
but we... we're, like, crazy-big fans.

233
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,252
我是说...
I mean... 

234
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,387
"为'星球大战'而狂"的狂热
"crazy for Star Wars" crazy,

235
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:11,354
而不是那种背着一袋胶带的疯狂
not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape,

236
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,753
虽然我们的确有个背包
although we do have a backpack

237
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,952
但你真的不会想打开看的
that you really don't want to look in.

238
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:19,098
你搞砸了
You're blowing it.

239
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,762
我们想见乔治·卢卡斯
We want to meet George Lucas

240
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:23,296
做他的朋友 陪他玩!
and become his friends and play with him!

241
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:26,998
喂?
Hello?

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,903
扬声器坏了 进来吧
This speaker's not working, just pull up.

243
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:35,543
这才是正确的打开方式
And that's how it's done.

244
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,599
好的 我们已经闯过了第一关
All right, we've defeated the first challenge.

245
00:10:52,969 --> 00:10:55,671
现在我们要鼓起勇气
Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster

246
00:10:55,673 --> 00:10:57,935
打败守门的怪兽
who defends the gate.

247
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,503
我们只是要保安给我们放行而已
We're trying to get past a security guard,

248
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,374
{\an8}塞尔达传说 游戏主人公

249
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,374
不是要解救塞尔达
not rescue Zelda.

250
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:06,579
我觉得你的想象力确实需要解救
I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy,

251
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:08,579
不过任务得一个一个接
but one quest at a time.

252
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:12,250
所以我们的计划是?
So what's the plan?

253
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:14,546
呃 我只是想实话实说
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.

254
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,921
那我们就进不去啦
Honesty will never get us in.

255
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,554
好吧 那你的计划是?
Well, what's your plan?

256
00:11:18,556 --> 00:11:21,924
我计划是 假定里面有一个医务室
All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption

257
00:11:21,926 --> 00:11:23,892
而你正好被刺伤了
that they have a nurse's office

258
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:26,764
这样我们就能名正言顺的进去了
and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.

259
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,205
你们是来找谁的?
Who are you here to see?

260
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,774
呃 我就跟你实话实说吧
Uh, I'm just gonna tell you the truth.

261
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:40,310
噢 一剑杀了我吧
Oh, you are killing me.

262
00:11:40,312 --> 00:11:42,350
我们没有预约
We don't have an appointment.

263
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,350
我... 我们只是Lucas先生的粉丝
We... we're just fans of Mr. Lucas's work,

264
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:45,615
想来碰碰运气
and we thought we'd take a shot

265
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:47,654
进去四处转一转什么的
and see if we could get in and look around.

266
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,086
对不起两位 你们这种情况我见多了
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

267
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,189
不能让你们进去
Can't let you in.

268
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:54,089
如果我告诉你 我就尤达的配音呢?
What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda?

269
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:59,295
这儿有个录音 我必须参加
A recording session I must attend.

270
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,988
对不起 别听他的
I'm sorry, don't listen to him.

271
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,692
我们其实是物理学家
We're actually physicists.

272
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:05,594
我们今天在伯克利有一场演讲
We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today.

273
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:07,594
我们只是... 想打发一下时间罢了
We just... we had some time to kill.

274
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,865
呃 你们看上去像是好人
Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys.

275
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,160
但还是不能让你们进
I can't let you in,

276
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,695
不过我有些帽子和T恤 可以送给你们
but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.

277
00:12:13,697 --> 00:12:15,566
非常感谢你
Thank you so much.

278
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,134
看见了吧?
See?

279
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,439
也许诚实才是最...
Maybe honesty is the best... 

280
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:19,439
你要干什么? 
What are you doing?

281
00:12:19,441 --> 00:12:21,102
挣脱压制者的束缚
Shedding the yoke of my oppressors,

282
00:12:21,104 --> 00:12:23,310
你这个愚蠢 短视的可怜人
you blind, sad little man.

283
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,478
别动!
Don't move!

284
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,510
代码 A-A-23 A-A-23
Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

285
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:28,878
收到
Copy.

286
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,013
我看到庄园了 Leonard!
I can see the ranch, Leonard!

287
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,580
噢 田园风 太可爱了!
Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely!

288
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:36,419
我想拍张照 但是他们都在追我
I'd take a picture, but people are chasing me.

289
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,282
我一定能进去...
I'm gonna make it...

290
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:40,585
我一定能进去!
I'm gonna make it!

291
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:42,919
他们有泰瑟枪 但他们不敢用...
They have Tasers, but they wouldn't dare use...

292
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,421
加油 Raj
Come on, Raj.

293
00:12:49,423 --> 00:12:53,125
你就是乒乓界的金刚!
You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong!

294
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,899
{\an8}即乒乓球

295
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,899
你就是桌上网球的最强杀手!
You are the menace of table tennis!

296
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,001
干掉她 因为我想不出第三个押韵了
Put her away, 'cause I don't have a third one.

297
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:01,768
好的! 太棒了!
Yes! Yes!

298
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:05,232
Rajesh得8分 Penny得4分
Rajesh eight, Penny four.

299
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:07,202
真抱歉 他打的太好了
Sorry, he's really good.

300
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,335
嘿 Raj
Hey, Raj.

301
00:13:09,337 --> 00:13:10,504
如果Howard守不住时光机
if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,

302
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:12,206
那把它放在你家里 该有多棒?
how great would it look at your place?

303
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,237
什么?
What?

304
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,676
对啊 你说什么?
Yeah, what?

305
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:17,104
我不是很了解"神奇博士"
I don't know much about Doctor Who,

306
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:19,004
但是如果 呃 把这东西放到你家
but if, um, you were to put this

307
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:23,037
用作前门 把后面拆掉
right outside your front door and open up the back,

308
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,066
就会感觉是 你整个房子都在
it would be like your entire apartment was

309
00:13:26,068 --> 00:13:27,833
时光机里面
the inside of the TARDIS,

310
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,569
是不是酷毙了
which is pretty cool

311
00:13:29,571 --> 00:13:31,901
因为在剧情里 这时光机的内部空间
'cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS

312
00:13:31,903 --> 00:13:34,835
比外边的世界大多了
is bigger than the outside.

313
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:38,759
我重申一下 我也不是太了解"神奇博士"
But then again, I don't know much about Doctor Who.

314
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:41,597
别听她的
Don't listen to her.

315
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,332
你和我交情都这么久了... 我们就像兄弟一样
You and I go way back... we're like brothers.

316
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:46,835
我们是兄弟 兄弟
We are. We are.

317
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:50,066
噢 不!
Oh, no!

318
00:13:50,068 --> 00:13:51,465
发球弱爆了!
What a terrible serve!

319
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,007
对不起 兄弟
Sorry, brother.

320
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:56,372
8比5 这太扯淡了
Eight-five. This is ridiculous.

321
00:13:56,374 --> 00:13:57,634
我要换一个选手
I want a new champion.

322
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,399
Amy 你说你会发球 是认真的吗?
Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?

323
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,733
呃 我很久不打了
Uh, it...it's been a long time.

324
00:14:02,735 --> 00:14:04,700
我不知道
I don't know.

325
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:06,637
我可能已经很迟钝了
I'm probably pretty rusty.

326
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,444
哇喔
Wow.

327
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:12,476
就是她了!
She's my champion!

328
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:14,515
好吧 既然你能换人 那我也要换
Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.

329
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:15,916
我要Raj 嘿
I want Raj. Hey.

330
00:14:15,918 --> 00:14:17,780
行了 得了吧 好像你在乎似的
Oh, come on, like you even care.

331
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:19,117
我当然在乎!
I care!

332
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:20,957
呃 等等 我确实不在乎 祝你好运 Raj
Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.

333
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,536
你知道吗 我以为我们的友情会更重要
You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.

334
00:14:26,264 --> 00:14:27,925
我也这么认为
So did I.

335
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,936
你觉得他们会报警吗?
Do you think they're gonna call the police?

336
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,865
我不知道
I don't know.

337
00:14:39,867 --> 00:14:42,168
也许他们会叫一个帝国军官来
Maybe they'll call Imperial Officers to take us

338
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,440
送我们去死星上蹲监狱
to a holding cell on the Death Star.

339
00:14:47,242 --> 00:14:50,544
呃 我觉得这还够不上帝国军官这种级别
Oh, I think that's below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer.

340
00:14:50,546 --> 00:14:51,911
暴风部队才是...
Stormtroopers are really the ones who...

341
00:14:51,913 --> 00:14:53,543
噢 闭嘴
Oh, shut up.

342
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,350
他说得对
He's right.

343
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:58,454
呃 暴风部队才同时拥有步兵
Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function

344
00:14:58,456 --> 00:15:00,620
和军事警察局的职能
of infantry and military police.

345
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,817
啊哈 我通常都不发火
Uh-huh, I'm normally very nice,

346
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,552
但是你也给我闭嘴
but you shut up, too.

347
00:15:13,296 --> 00:15:14,789
所以...
So...

348
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,596
你犯什么事了?
what are you in for?

349
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:21,266
说实话 我只想见Lucas先生一面 对他说声谢谢
Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

350
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,762
你知道的 在我长大成人的过程中 那些电影对我意义非凡
You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life.

351
00:15:24,764 --> 00:15:27,067
我一直不知道自己属于哪里
I never really fit in anywhere.

352
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:29,107
直到发现了他所创造的世界
Till I discovered the worlds he created

353
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:31,905
我才找到了自己的归属感
and finally found a place where I belong.

354
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,207
那你怎么会在这儿?
But why are you here?

355
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,839
噢 我 呃... 我翻了一道篱笆
Oh, I, uh... I hopped a fence,

356
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,510
他们在雕塑馆里抓到了我
and they caught me in the sculpture gallery

357
00:15:38,512 --> 00:15:41,276
当时我正在和楚巴卡雕塑亲热
making out with a Chewbacca statue.

358
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:48,875
失陪一下
Excuse me.

359
00:15:57,148 --> 00:15:59,050
Leonard啊
Leonard,

360
00:15:59,052 --> 00:16:01,321
他们有一个雕塑馆
they have a sculpture gallery.

361
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,687
好了 我跟上级汇报过了
All right, I talked to my supervisor,

362
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:08,895
得给你个警告 不过你可以走了
and we're gonna let you go with a warning.

363
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,696
要是你敢再回来
But if you ever come back,

364
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:12,360
我们就报警 告你了
we will call the police and press charges.

365
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,360
明白
We understand.

366
00:16:13,362 --> 00:16:14,328
多谢您了
Thank you so much.

367
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,935
那我呢?
Uh, what about me?

368
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,366
你给我老实呆着 嘟嘴哥
No, you're not going anywhere, kissy face.

369
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:18,934
走吧
Let's go.

370
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,037
我得拍张你的照片 贴在安检门口
I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.

371
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:23,005
拍照的事
Uh, one question

372
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:24,500
我有个小问题
about that picture.

373
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,307
{\an8}星战导演

374
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:26,307
能不能和George Lucas合照呢?
Can it be with George Lucas?

375
00:16:27,973 --> 00:16:30,107
哎哟哟 你好暴躁呢
Ooh, grumpy you are.

376
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:38,082
好 这就是决胜局了
Okay, this is the match that decides it all.

377
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,355
先拿到11分的算赢
First to 11 wins.

378
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:42,186
每五分 换发球权
Serve switches every five points.

379
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,723
告知你一下 一开始
And just so you know, when this started,

380
00:16:43,725 --> 00:16:46,492
我本来只想把时光机放在某个隐蔽的角落
I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house,

381
00:16:46,494 --> 00:16:48,028
不过既然你逼我做坏人 现在我要把它
but I've since turned mean, and now it's going

382
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,531
放在客厅正中央
right in the middle of the living room

383
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,298
下面再加一个旋转展示台 上面挂个大牌子"去死吧"
on a rotating platform with a sign that says "suck it."

384
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,466
游戏开始
Game on.

385
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:56,169
不过...
Except...

386
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,537
Raj会赢的
Raj is gonna win.

387
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,832
对吧 Raj?
Isn't that right, Raj?

388
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:02,302
对 不过 她发球确实挺厉害的
Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.

389
00:17:02,304 --> 00:17:03,836
别怂 跟她玩心理战
Come on, get in her head.

390
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:05,002
气势上压倒她
Be intimidating.

391
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:07,034
好...
Okay, uh...

392
00:17:07,036 --> 00:17:08,201
你就等死吧 婊子!
I'm gonna own you, bitch!

393
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,872
喂! 嘿!
Whoa! Hey!

394
00:17:09,874 --> 00:17:11,376
这话说得太狠了
That's not nice.

395
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,280
开始比吧
Let's just play.

我说
Wait,

402
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,223
你玩的是羽毛球
did you play badminton

403
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:31,863
还是郁闷球?
or sad-minton?

404
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,862
别听他的... 她也就会发球
Don't listen to him... all she's got is a serve.

405
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:37,334
你快塞上卫生棉条 把她打倒
Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.

406
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,334
啥...?
Wha...?

407
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,832
这样说就可以?
A... And that's not offensive?

408
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:40,874
底线到底在哪啊?
Where's the line?

409
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,010
{an8}purse专指女士钱包 此处为了句意 加了粉色

410
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:43,010

刚刚真是惊险刺激的四十秒
Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.

426
00:18:24,515 --> 00:18:26,784
确实 现在该你发球了
It was, and now the serve is back to you,

427
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:28,552
游戏就要结束了
and the game is over.

428
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,792
我说 Amy啊...
You know, Amy, I, uh...

429
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,760
不知道Sheldon看到你房间里
can't help but wonder how Sheldon would react

430
00:18:34,762 --> 00:18:36,960
有个时光机会怎么想呢
if the TARDIS was at your place.

431
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:39,961
别听她的 快发球
Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.

432
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:42,330
你继续说
Keep talking.

433
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:48,906
要是这还不能让他进你卧室
If this doesn't get him into your bedroom,

434
00:18:48,908 --> 00:18:50,578
我真不知道还能怎么办了
nothing will.

435
00:18:56,988 --> 00:18:58,450
你还生我的气吗?
Are you still mad at me?

436
00:18:58,452 --> 00:19:02,125
对啊 我们错过了讲座 差点被逮捕了
Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested,

437
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,126
你害得我被关起来了
and you got me locked in a room with a man

438
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:08,630
还和一个对伍基人雕塑强行舌吻的人关在一起
who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

439
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:11,997
天呐 某些人只能看到半杯空 看不到半杯满
Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.

440
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,534
这整个就是空的啊 Sheldon
The glass is empty, Sheldon.

441
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:15,774
一滴水都没
It's completely empty.

442
00:19:15,776 --> 00:19:17,773
你要是把这杯给一个快渴死的人
If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst,

443
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,805
他就死了 知道为什么吗?
he would be dead, do you know why?

444
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,909
我回答之前先问一下 他吸烟吗?
Before I answer, was he a smoker?

445
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,683
我觉得你得换一个角度看事情
I think you're looking at this all wrong.

446
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,282
好吧 那你说 我该怎么看
Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.

447
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:36,586
我们不仅开到了"天行者庄园" 还进了门
Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

448
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:38,889
我们圈子里 这可是头一次
No one we know can say that.

449
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:42,226
而且 你不是一直嫌我烦吗
And for all the times you find me irritating,

450
00:19:42,228 --> 00:19:45,500
今天你目睹了我被泰瑟枪电倒的景象
today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.

451
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:51,475
这我确实看得很开心
That part was pretty good.

452
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,170
是吧?
See?

453
00:19:53,172 --> 00:19:56,145
你确实抖动了好一阵
You did flop around a lot.

454
00:19:56,147 --> 00:19:58,411
我就暂且信了吧
I'll take your word for it.

455
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:01,517
当时我在竭尽全力不让自己大便失禁
I was too busy trying not to defecate.

456
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,686
知道吗 他们把我们押送到
You know, when they were escorting us

457
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,925
拘留室的路上 我透过某扇门
to the detaining room, I looked through a door,

458
00:20:08,927 --> 00:20:10,893
应该是看到了一个装着
and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case

459
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,828
{\an8}约柜: 传说中遗失的圣物

460
00:20:10,895 --> 00:20:12,828
约柜的展示柜
with the Ark of the Covenant.

461
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,163
- 太棒了  - 是啊
- That's amazing.  - I know.

462
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,435
{\an8}星战中的怪物

463
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:18,435
我看到赫特人贾巴骑着摩托车路过
And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle.

464
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:20,835
不过是我被电倒之后看到的
Although that was right after the Tasing,

465
00:20:20,837 --> 00:20:22,908
也不知道是不是幻觉
so who can say for sure?

466
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:27,170
我... 想 这也算是一次大冒险了
I... I guess this could count as an adventure.

467
00:20:27,172 --> 00:20:28,442
确实是
It was.

468
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:31,073
虽然我们不能再回去了
And even though we're not allowed back there,

469
00:20:31,075 --> 00:20:33,378
但是他们夺不走我们今天的记忆
they can never take today away from us.

470
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:36,112
不过好像夺走了我的嗅觉
Unlike my sense of smell,

471
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,679
被电倒之后 我就闻不到东西了
which hasn't returned since the Tasing.

472
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,853
嗯 什么味道都没有
No, I got nothing.

473
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:55,340
{\an8} 戴立克是博士的机器人对头

474
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:55,340
Amy 戴立克追的我好紧!
Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail!

475
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,677
快 重设时间电路
Quick, we need to reset the time circuits.

476
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,846
不好 我把音速起子落下了
Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.

477
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,138
当时真该多想想
Really should have thought this through.

478
00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:11,138
