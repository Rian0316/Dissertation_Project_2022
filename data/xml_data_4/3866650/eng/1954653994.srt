Mike, I got to ask...

71
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:52,505
I mean... I know I just
need to move on from this,

72
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:56,142
but I keep thinking about something.

73
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,343
About what?

74
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:59,179
How, before Matty died,

75
00:05:59,231 --> 00:06:04,601
like, for a few weeks there,
he was... Different.

76
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:07,604
Different how?

77
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:09,823
Different... I don't know.

78
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:11,508
Moody, you know?

79
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:15,328
He barely ate. H... He wasn't sleeping.

80
00:06:15,363 --> 00:06:18,331
He snapped at me
about the stupidest things.

81
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:20,750
I started to think something's up at work

82
00:06:20,785 --> 00:06:22,752
or... or someone's sick,
something like that,

83
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:25,788
but he wouldn't talk to me.
He clammed right up.

84
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,876
Cops aren't real touchy-feely.
You know that.

85
00:06:29,928 --> 00:06:32,295
No.

86
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,297
[Scoffs] They're not. No.

87
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:38,718
But this wasn't the normal
"tough guys don't cry" crap.

88
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,936
This was more.

89
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:42,772
I mean... Did you notice?

90
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:44,190
I mean, did you feel

91
00:06:44,226 --> 00:06:46,192
anything like that from him?

92
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:49,195
I don't... as far as I remember,
he seemed okay.

93
00:06:49,231 --> 00:06:51,114
He seemed okay to me.

94
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:54,734
Well, I started to think... I'm...

95
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:57,737
I don't know. I didn't know what to think.

96
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:00,156
But then... Three days

97
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,991
or... or four... I don't remember...

98
00:07:01,993 --> 00:07:04,711
But before he died,
there was this phone call.

99
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:08,464
2:30 in the morning, I wake up,
and Matty's not in bed.

100
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,884
And I hear him. He's talking downstairs.

101
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,087
So... I go to listen on the stairs,

102
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:16,723
where he couldn't see.

103
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,259
He gets intense.

104
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,977
Like, he'd be screaming

105
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:23,596
if he wasn't whispering, you know?

106
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:26,432
Matty didn't get worked up.
He'd let things go.

107
00:07:26,484 --> 00:07:30,069
But... but this... I mean, he was angry.

108
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:32,906
He was really angry.

109
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,158
What was he saying?

110
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:39,362
I couldn't make it out.
It was something about...

111
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,364
I don't know. I couldn't hear it.

112
00:07:41,366 --> 00:07:43,199
[Sighs]

113
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,034
But the next morning, I called him out...

114
00:07:45,036 --> 00:07:47,670
"What the hell was that about?
What's going on?"

115
00:07:47,706 --> 00:07:50,623
And he wouldn't talk to me.

116
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:54,043
But I think...

117
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:56,629
I think he was talking to you.

118
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:59,048
Me?

119
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,684
I mean, who else?

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,852
Huh?

121
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:05,471
For one hot second,

122
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:07,307
I thought maybe he was catting around...

123
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:08,808
No, he wouldn't do that.

124
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,194
No, I know. I know that. But you...

125
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,028
He knew he could call you
anytime he had a problem.

126
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,031
You were thick as thieves, the two of you.

127
00:08:16,066 --> 00:08:18,033
And there was something in his voice.

128
00:08:18,068 --> 00:08:21,653
It was... How he was talking.

129
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:24,039
It makes me think it was you.

130
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:26,658
Stace, I don't think it was.

131
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,878
I can't recall any late-night
heart-to-hearts with him,

132
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:31,546
not around then.

133
00:08:31,582 --> 00:08:35,500
Maybe it was a C.I. or a case.

134
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:37,719
Listen.

135
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:40,922
I know what you're doing...
replaying it over and over,

136
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,141
thinking, "if I'd noticed this
or changed that",

137
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:45,760
maybe I could have done something."

138
00:08:45,762 --> 00:08:48,980
You don't think I haven't had
those thoughts? I do.

yourself up like this.

That's really all there is to it.

144
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
Yeah.

145
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,558
I guess that's that.

146
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,631

00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,727
Okay.

150
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,562
Well, if you want me to drop by

151
00:09:37,614 --> 00:09:40,565
and keep an eye on her, I...

152
00:09:40,617 --> 00:09:42,234
I want to help.

"Francisco."

159
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,252
Yeah.

160
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,670
You know this town?

161
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:37,088
Yeah, sure.

162
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:38,540
How well?

- [Dogs barking, whining]
- Caldera: You sew this up yourself?

164

Not bad.

165
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,433
Bet there's a story there.

166
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:51,436
- Isn't there always?
- Yeah.

167
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,639
All right. Little sting here.

168
00:10:54,691 --> 00:10:58,026
Okay. That ought to do it.

169
00:10:58,061 --> 00:10:59,444
Now...

[Scissors thud]

You're gonna want to take it easy.

172
00:11:02,866 --> 00:11:04,816
Keep it clean.

173
00:11:04,868 --> 00:11:07,452
Keep it dry. Let it heal.

174
00:11:07,487 --> 00:11:10,572
There's a Walgreens a couple
blocks over on Louisiana.

175
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,407
Maybe go get yourself a sling.

176
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,042
You don't have one?

177
00:11:14,077 --> 00:11:15,877
[Scoffs] [Chuckling] Sorry.

178
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:17,462
Got a cone you can put around your neck.

179
00:11:17,497 --> 00:11:18,496
Yeah.

180
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:21,916
It's about the same, right?

181
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,336
So, it's gonna be $500?

182
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,754
$500.

183
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:29,758
I can, uh, throw some pills in
for the pain.

184
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,426
[Pills rattling]

185
00:11:31,428 --> 00:11:33,061
This stuff's essentially Vicodin.

186
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,063
I can give it to you for $25 a pill...

187
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:37,482
maybe drop the price to $15

188
00:11:37,517 --> 00:11:39,985
for something a little less human-centric.

189
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,188
I'm an aspirin man. [Sighs]

190
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,025
Tell you what...
take a couple on the house.

191
00:11:47,077 --> 00:11:49,277
In case you change your mind.

192
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,947
You new in town?

193
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,583
Yeah.

194
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:57,686
Passing through or sticking around?

195
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:59,888
Why?

196
00:11:59,923 --> 00:12:01,623
No reason.

197
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:06,628
It's just, if you're relocating
to the land of enchantment,

198
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,464
I know people.

199
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,049
I could get you some work.

200
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:14,469
I am not looking for that kind of work,

201
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:19,474
but... ohh... thanks.

202
00:12:22,729 --> 00:12:25,313
Don't know why it has to be this way.

203
00:12:25,315 --> 00:12:28,533
Could have been friendly.
Could have talked in your house.

204
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,952
You really want the formal treatment?

205
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:32,370
Lawyer.

206
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,572
Come on, Mike.

207
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:36,207
It's just a couple of questions.

208
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:39,044
Uh, ain't nothing but a thing.

209
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,662
Lawyer.

210
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,747
You're not under arrest.

211
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:44,382
Okay, did anybody here say "arrest"? No.

212
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:46,084
You want to walk, walk.

213
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,919
I got to say, I, uh, expected

214
00:12:47,971 --> 00:12:51,172
more cooperation
from you on this, cop to cop.

215
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,642
Lawyer.

216
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,482
[Sighs]

217
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,687
Fine. What lawyer?

218
00:13:14,568 --> 00:13:16,952
Ehrmantraut... Who's got him and where?

219
00:13:16,987 --> 00:13:19,755
That way.

220
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,757
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

221
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,692
James McGill... here to see my client.

222
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,444
What?

223
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:30,147
- You look like Matlock.
- Uh, no,

224
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,367
I look like a young Paul Newman
dressed as Matlock.

225
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:34,952
Where's my guy?

226
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:36,820
[Beep]

227
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:40,040
[Sighs] Say hello to Barney fife.

228
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:44,044
Wrong show, but thanks for playing.

229
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,246
[Sighs]

230
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:47,631
So, what happened...

231
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,500
the mayor didn't give you enough stickers?

232
00:13:52,388 --> 00:13:54,972
You want to tell me what we're doing here?

233
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:56,974
Oh, here's your coffee.

234
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,810
Uh, hope it's good to the last drop,

235
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:02,012
'cause I'm billing you
the full hour for it.

236
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,430
That's for you.

237
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:06,066
Oh. That's very thoughtful.

238
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,484
[Sighs]

239
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,903
You serious?

240
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:11,221
Why did you have me bring it to you?

241
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,556
Mike: All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

242
00:14:12,615 --> 00:14:15,776
Those two cops out there
are from Philadelphia.

243
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:17,577
They've come a long way to see me.

244
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,997
When they come in here,
we're all gonna have a little chat.

245
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:20,915
And when it's over,

246
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,667
the young one, who's been
writing in his little notebook,

247
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:25,669
he's gonna take it
and put it in his jacket.

248
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:27,287
And when he does that,

249
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,957
I want you to take that coffee
and spill it on him...

250
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,377
little accident, that's all.

251
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,347
- And why, pray tell, would I do that?
- Because I'm asking you to.

252
00:14:36,428 --> 00:14:38,666
- It's the only reason you're here.
- [Sighs]

253
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:40,898
So I'm here because you want me
to assault a police officer.

254
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:44,902
I am asking you to take
a few ounces of lukewarm coffee

255
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:46,353
and spill it on him.

256
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:49,773
I doubt that satisfies
the definition of "assault,"

257
00:14:49,825 --> 00:14:53,193
but, hey, you're the lawyer.

258
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:55,195
Right. How silly of me.

259
00:14:55,197 --> 00:14:57,031
All you want is for me to aid and abet

260
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,749
you ripping off that guy's notepad,

261
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:00,834
'cause that's what
you're doing here, right?

262
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,836
Huh? What... are you nuts?

263
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,371
You can't be serious.

264
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,989
Hey, I hate to remind you
of this, but you owe me one.

265
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,608
The assist I gave you with
the missing-persons problem...

266
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,243
one good turn and so forth?

267
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,863
You want a good turn?
Here's your good turn, okay?

268
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,581
I'm gonna behave

269
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:20,001
like an honest-to-God,
law-abiding, licensed attorney,

270
00:15:20,037 --> 00:15:21,920
'cause, clearly, you need one

271
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,421
with whatever the hell is going on here.

272
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,173
Now, those two jokers out in the hallway...

273
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,542
I'm gonna make sure they dot
their I's and cross their t's...

274
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,961
everything square and above board.

275
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,379
That's what I'm gonna do,

276
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,015
and you're gonna be
happy as hell that I'm here.

277
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:38,269
But this little Juan Valdez
bump-and-dump... no.

278
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,888
Not gonna happen.

279
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,523
[Knock on door]

280
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:44,526
Hey, gentlemen,
we're prepared to indulge you.

281
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,144
[Clears throat]

282
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:49,698
Abbasi: Detective Escalara
will be sitting in with us,

283
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,534
as per APD policy. Okay with you, right?

284
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:54,152
Fine with me.

285
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,154
Okay.

286
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58,123
You got your lawyer, Mike.
Can we talk already?

287
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,576
Great. So, like we said,

288
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:04,079
we're here looking into
this Hoffman and Fensky thing.

289
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,631
Yeah, and whatever you can
tell us... anything at all.

290
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:07,832
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

291
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,468
"Hoffman." "Fensky."

292
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,670
[Smacks lips] Fill me in.

293
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:14,889
Assume I know absolutely nothing

294
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,307
about my client here, all right?

295
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,560
- Start at the beginning.
- Jesus. Seriously?

296
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,396
Look, don't let
Mr. Ehrmantraut's dancing eyes

297
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:24,399
and bubbly,
bon vivant personality fool you.

298
00:16:24,434 --> 00:16:28,269
He's actually... believe it
or not... somewhat taciturn.

299
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,940
Shall I fan you gently,
so you don't go into shock?

300
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:36,444
Start at the beginning, okay?
We're talking book of genesis.

301
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,446
[Pen scribbling] Okay, Mr. McGill,
as you probably gathered,

302
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,281
we, Detective Sanders and I...

303
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,283
work for the Philadelphia
Police Department,

304
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,786
as did Mr. Ehrmantraut for nearly 30 years.

305
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,622
Philadelphia? Go, Eagles.

306
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,624
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt.

307
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,459
He, too, was with Philly P.D.

308
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,095
He was a rookie officer with
about two years on the job.

309
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,965
- He was a good cop.
- Yes, he was.

310
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,184
About nine months ago, he responded

311
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:02,604
to a shots-fired call
in some West Side rattrap.

312
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,223
Matt went in with his partner,
officer Troy Hoffman.

313
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,443
They had sergeant Jack Fensky
backing them up.

314
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,278
Unfortunately, things got out of hand.

315
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:11,896
The three of them were ambushed,

316
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,315
and, uh, Matt didn't make it out.

317
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,151
Hoffman and Fensky returned fire,

318
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,652
but the shooter got away.

319
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:20,488
We chased a few leads,
shook up the usual suspects...

320
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,323
came up short.

321
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,661
I'm very sorry to hear it.

322
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,496
Anyways, we kept beating the bushes,

323
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:31,499
kept coming up dry until three months ago.

324
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,718
That's when Hoffman and Fensky
both turned up dead

325
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,587
in a vacant lot out in nicetown...

326
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:38,423
Again, an ambush of
some kind, it looks like.

327
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,258
And with whoever killed Matt
out there in the wind,

328
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,677
we're thinking...
Well, it's our operating theory

329
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,096
that Hoffman and Fensky
were mixed up in something,

330
00:17:45,098 --> 00:17:49,100
some bad business,
and maybe that got Matt killed.

331
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:51,519
Yeah, sorry. I got to do
my lawyer thing here.

332
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,355
Uh, what does my client
have to do with any of this?

333
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,774
Uh, Mike, this is a hail Mary.

334
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:59,077
Uh, beyond that.

335
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,079
I mean, if we had
any hard evidence or leads,

336
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,447
we wouldn't be out here.

337
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,666
Now, there's anything you can tell us

338
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,118
about what Hoffman and Fensky were into?

339
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,453
Yeah, help us out, Mike.

340
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,538
Help us catch the bastard who killed Matty.

341
00:18:14,044 --> 00:18:16,628
I don't know much about Hoffman and Fensky.

342
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,048
They were Matt's people.
I'd see them around sometimes.

343
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,300
I saw them in a bar the night they died.

344
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,718
It was Mcclure's...

345
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:27,138
maybe the Red Dog... Probably Mcclure's.

346
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,140
Were they drinking with anyone?

347
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,558
It's a cop bar.

348
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,060
They were drinking with everyone.

349
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,695
Yeah, but did you see them
with anyone in particular?

350
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,314
I couldn't tell you. I was...

351
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,483
You know how I was.

352
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,702
How you doing these days?

353
00:18:40,737 --> 00:18:43,121
Feeling like I crawled out
from the bottom of a bottle

354
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,540
and working hard to stay there.

355
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:47,742
Although I've got to say...

356
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:51,079
doesn't help much,
dredging up the past like this.

357
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,914
Let me ask you,

358

once you heard the news?

for the funerals, correct,

00:28:03,492 --> 00:28:06,059
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

533
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:07,694
Hey, how about I give you a lift home?

534
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:10,697
Mnh.

535
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:12,132
I'm fine.

536
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:14,334
No, I can't let you drive. Get you a cab?

537
00:28:14,369 --> 00:28:16,736
No, I'm good. I'm good.

538
00:28:16,772 --> 00:28:18,905
Don't worry.

539
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,542
Anyway, I sold my car, so I'm walking.

540
00:28:22,577 --> 00:28:25,378
Thank you.

541
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:29,999
Albuquerque, New Mexico.

542
00:28:30,051 --> 00:28:32,836
- You ever been?
- Nope.

543
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:37,841
Well... That's where I'm headed.

544
00:28:37,893 --> 00:28:39,342
- Tarantulas, they got.
- [Chuckles]

545
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:41,344
That's a big minus in my book.

546
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:47,267
[Chuckles] Well, I will be on the lookout.

547
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,902
You take care, my friend.

548
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:50,937
Take care.

549
00:29:21,636 --> 00:29:24,220
[Vehicle approaches]

550
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:27,056
Hoffman: Hey, Mike.

551
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,808
Mikey.

552
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,697
You want a ride?

553
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,066
I'm walking.

554
00:29:37,118 --> 00:29:39,953
Pull over here.

555
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:48,797
Hoffman: What are you doing out here?

556
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,296
Come on. Let us drive you.

557
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,580
It's colder than my ex-wife's tit out here.

558
00:29:51,632 --> 00:29:53,582
Come on. Come on.

559
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:55,001
I'm walking.

560
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,836
Come on. Don't... don't be an ass.

561
00:29:56,838 --> 00:29:58,254
- Come on. Let us take you home.
- Get in the car already.

562
00:29:58,306 --> 00:29:59,472
It's cold out here.

563
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,891
Come on, Mike. Come on.

564
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,927
- [Grunts]
- Come on.

565
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,762
Okay. Easy.

566
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:08,064
[Groaning]

567
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,815
We're gonna have you home in no time.

568
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:12,485
Oh, God.

569
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,322
Hey. What are you doing?

570
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:20,526
Hey. Give me that. That's mine.

571
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,528
Later.

572
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:26,532
We don't want you to shoot
your foot off, now, do we?

573
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,545
[Mumbling]

574
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:44,267
- Fensky: Hey, Mikey.
- What?

575
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:45,514
Mikey, you with us?

576
00:30:45,566 --> 00:30:47,516
Why?

577
00:30:47,568 --> 00:30:49,935
You really tied one on good
back there, buddy.

578
00:30:49,937 --> 00:30:52,154
Shit, yeah, he did...
put it away like they were

579
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:54,356
fixing to bring back prohibition.

580
00:30:54,408 --> 00:30:55,991
[Grunts]

581
00:30:56,027 --> 00:30:57,610
Hey, hey, back at Mcclure's,

582
00:30:57,612 --> 00:31:00,029
you were talking out your ass, hmm?

583
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:01,947
"I know it was you." [Chuckles]

584
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:03,916
What's that supposed to mean, huh?

585
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:06,752
You think you know what?

586
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:09,171
You got something
you want to get off your chest,

587
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:11,123
something you want to say to us?

588
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,959
You killed him.

589
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,846
You killed Matty.

590
00:31:17,882 --> 00:31:22,468
And you killed him for nothing.

591
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,888
You killed him because you were scared

592
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,108
of what you thought he might do.

593
00:31:29,143 --> 00:31:33,529
You got him in that crack house...

594
00:31:33,564 --> 00:31:37,533
And you staged it...

595
00:31:37,568 --> 00:31:40,486
made it look like a junkie with a gun.

596
00:31:48,496 --> 00:31:52,498
But it was you.

597
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,751
And I know it was you.

598
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,007
And I'm gonna prove it.

599
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:14,520
[Sighs]

600
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,705
Help me get him out of the car.

601
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,124
[Engine shuts off]

602
00:32:52,748 --> 00:32:54,482
What?

603
00:32:54,548 --> 00:32:56,965
Come on. There you go. Watch your head.

604
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:58,801
[Sighs]

605
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,636
All right, come on, Mike, huh?

606
00:33:00,688 --> 00:33:03,305
One, two, one, two, buddy.

607
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,893
Now, you wait there one second.

608
00:33:07,895 --> 00:33:10,729
We're gonna work this
whole thing out, okay, Mikey?

609
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,153
What do we do now?

610
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,610
Hey. Grief... it's a bitch.

611
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:22,865
He couldn't live with it...
Matt dying the way he did.

612
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,452
It's too much for the old man.
So Mikey here decided to eat his gun.

613
00:33:26,454 --> 00:33:29,772
It's tragic, but anyone
could see this coming, hmm?

614
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:31,560
He's drinking himself to death.

615
00:33:31,612 --> 00:33:33,746
We're doing him a favor.

616
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:36,586
Smart. That's what I would
have done if I were you.

617
00:33:50,435 --> 00:33:52,602
[Gun clicks]

618
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:07,033
[Breathing heavily]

619
00:34:09,504 --> 00:34:11,504
[Groaning]

620
00:34:26,221 --> 00:34:28,555
Mike, I...

621
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:20,990
You let some things slide
and you look the other way.

622
00:35:21,026 --> 00:35:22,742
You bust a drug dealer

623
00:35:22,777 --> 00:35:27,363
that has more cash than
you'll ever earn in a lifetime.

624
00:35:27,415 --> 00:35:32,585
Some of it doesn't make it
back into evidence... So what?

625
00:35:32,621 --> 00:35:35,755
You took a taste. So did everyone else.

626
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:39,208
That's how you knew you were safe.

627
00:35:42,631 --> 00:35:47,266
It's like killing Caesar...
Everyone's guilty.

628
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,970
Matt wasn't dirty.

629
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,974
I was.

630
00:35:54,976 --> 00:35:58,394
Everyone was in that precinct.

631
00:35:58,446 --> 00:35:59,979
That's how it worked.

632
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:05,685
You turn in your buddy,
you're screwing yourself.

633
00:36:05,987 --> 00:36:09,656
You go along to get along.

634
00:36:11,826 --> 00:36:14,077
And you went along.

635
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:19,465
[Chuckles, clicks tongue]

636
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,669
I did.

637
00:36:22,671 --> 00:36:23,836
Yeah.

638
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,056
I did.

639
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:32,261
Okay. But you said Matt didn't.

640
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:33,680
No.

641
00:36:33,682 --> 00:36:37,316
Not Matt.

642
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:41,154
Fensky got to Hoffman early...

643
00:36:41,189 --> 00:36:43,990
kickbacks from some gang or another...

644
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:46,409
protection, basically.

645
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:49,245
And Hoffman went to Matty
and offered to cut him in.

646
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,864
Only fair, right? They were partners.

647
00:36:53,952 --> 00:36:57,754
And Matt did what you would think...

648
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:01,174
He agonized.

649
00:37:01,209 --> 00:37:05,595
And then he came to me,
wanted to go to the I.A.,

650
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,096
do the right thing, shut 'em down.

651
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:08,381
Oh, my God. And you let him?

652
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:10,216
That's why he got killed...

653
00:37:10,218 --> 00:37:11,634
'cause he was gonna turn on those guys?

654
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:15,054
No. No.

655
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:17,690
I told him...

656
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:20,309
[Sighs]

657
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:23,446
You know what a cop fears most?

658
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:27,450
More than getting shot, more than anything?

659
00:37:27,485 --> 00:37:30,453
Prison...

660
00:37:30,488 --> 00:37:32,989
getting locked up
with everybody you put away.

661
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:38,411
You threaten a cop with that,
you make him dangerous,

662
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,329
and that's what I told him.

663
00:37:40,381 --> 00:37:44,167
I talked sense.

664
00:37:44,219 --> 00:37:47,003
No one was getting hurt.

665
00:37:47,055 --> 00:37:48,421
But if you go to the I.A.,

666
00:37:48,423 --> 00:37:52,642
if you even look like you're going...

667
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:58,566
He had a wife, a kid, responsibilities.

668
00:38:00,268 --> 00:38:03,903
Take the money. Do something good with it.

669
00:38:03,938 --> 00:38:06,739
[Chuckles]

670
00:38:06,775 --> 00:38:12,612
Well... I tried.

671
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:16,332
I tried.

672
00:38:16,367 --> 00:38:18,534
But he wouldn't listen.

673
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:20,953
[Chuckles]

674
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:23,623
My boy was stubborn.

675
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,628
My boy was strong.

676
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,632
And he was gonna get himself killed.

677
00:38:32,634 --> 00:38:36,636
[Voice breaking] So I told him...

678
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:39,856
[Normal voice] I told him I did it, too,

679
00:38:39,891 --> 00:38:42,692
that I was like Hoffman, getting by,

680
00:38:42,727 --> 00:38:45,394
and that's what you heard that night...

681
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:47,113
me talking him down,

682
00:38:47,148 --> 00:38:50,650
him kicking and screaming
until the fight went out of him.

683
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:53,319
He put me up on a pedestal...

684
00:38:58,076 --> 00:39:01,460
And I had to show him,

685
00:39:01,496 --> 00:39:05,131
that I was down in the gutter
with the rest of them.

686
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,670
Broke my boy.

687
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:17,593
[Voice breaking] I broke my boy.

688
00:39:17,645 --> 00:39:21,230
He went to Hoffman, he took the money,

689
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,149
but he hesitated.

690
00:39:23,184 --> 00:39:26,435
Even looking like you're doing
the right thing to those two

691
00:39:26,487 --> 00:39:30,857
meant that he wasn't solid,
that he couldn't be trusted.

692
00:39:35,864 --> 00:39:38,281
I got Matty to take the money.

693
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:45,121
And they killed him two days later.

694
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:50,509
[Breathes deeply]

695
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:54,931
He was the strongest person
that I ever knew.

696
00:39:54,966 --> 00:40:00,353
He'd have never done it,
not even to save himself.

697
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:03,973
I was the only one...

698
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:05,975
I was the only one that could get him

699
00:40:06,027 --> 00:40:10,196
to debase himself like that.

700
00:40:10,231 --> 00:40:13,032
[Scoffs]

701
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:16,869
And it was for nothing.

702
00:40:16,905 --> 00:40:20,873
I made him lesser.

703
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:23,743
I made him like me.

704
00:40:27,415 --> 00:40:31,417
And the bastards killed him anyway.

705
00:40:50,438 --> 00:40:53,272
Hoffman and Fensky...

706
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:59,528
if they killed Matty...

707
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,365
Who killed them?

708
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:07,787
Pop... What happened?

709
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,845
You know what happened.

710
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,561
The question is...

711
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,450
can you live with it?
