1
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:04,416
两位 我需要你们听我说
Girls, I need your attention.

2
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:07,886
你大多情况下还需要儿童餐椅
You also need a booster seat for most places.

3
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:10,922
不 我出来是要告诉你们重大消息
No, I came out to tell you some big news.

4
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,758
你今天穿着这件毛衣来上班
You also came out when you wore that sweater

5
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,826
已经算出柜了
to work today.

6
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:18,363
约翰·梅尔接受Details采访时就穿的这件毛衣
John Mayer wore this sweater in Details.

7
00:00:18,364 --> 00:00:21,466
今晚 我们要尝试家庭式服务
Tonight, we are trying family-style service.

8
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,692
我以为家庭式服务是我被逼给叔叔
I thought family-style service was what I had to do

9
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,904
干的那种活儿
with my uncle.

10
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:29,107
我的家庭式更偏向于"百乐餐"...
Well, my family-style is more "potluck"...

11
00:00:29,108 --> 00:00:33,945
享乐为主 吃饭为辅
heavy on the pot, not so heavy on the luck.

12
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:36,948
一家人干嘛要来这儿?
Why would a family come here?

13
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:40,418
要是我在这儿看到孩子 我就报警了
If I see a child in here, I'm calling the police.

14
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:43,588
就像关爱锁在高温车里的狗狗一样
It's like seeing a dog locked in a hot car.

15
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:46,358
鸡块 家庭式的
Chicken cacciatore, family-style.

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,960
肝和洋葱 家庭式的
Liver and onions, family-style.

17
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:52,063
意大利面和肉丸 我家式的
Spaghetti and meatballs, my family-style,

18
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,599
也就是肉丸有点小
which means the balls are kinda small,

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,137
但面条特别长
but the noodles are extra long.

20
00:00:59,138 --> 00:01:01,873
你们拿大碗盛出食物
You bring out the food in large bowls

21
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,842
然后顾客们自己动手
and the customers serve themselves,

22
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:07,579
就跟我雇了你们俩 顾客也要自己动手一样
as they've been doing since I hired you two.

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,314
好主意 Han
Good idea, Han.

24
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:11,149
餐厅的食物确实得放在一个桶里...
The diner food does belong in a big bowl...

25
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,652
厕所马桶
the toilet bowl.

26
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:19,390
真不知道你叔叔看上你什么了
I don't know what your uncle saw in you.

27
00:01:20,818 --> 00:01:23,218
破产姐妹花 第四季第22集 季终集

Max 我刚在手机上
Max, I just found something

32
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,045
看到非常烦人的东西
very upsetting on my phone.

33
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,515
又一张免费的U2专辑?
Another free U2 album?

34
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,150
更糟糕
Worse.

35
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:46,818
而且比收到朋友的电子邀请看即兴演出还惨
And worse than an e-vite to a friend's improv show.

36
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:51,024
是一封糕潮店总经理的邮件
It's an e-mail from the managing director

37
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,493
说他看过我们的销售业绩
of all The High restaurants saying he's seen our sales

38
00:01:53,494 --> 00:01:55,795
并对我的表现非常失望
and is disappointed with my performance.

39
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:59,065
删掉...
Duh-lete...

40
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,466
就像我删掉
like I do with all

41
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:02,316
跟我睡过的家伙们发的
the "disappointed in your performance" texts

42
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:04,871
"对你的表现失望"的短信一样
I get from guys after sex.

43
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:07,874
抱歉 哥们! 我的咪咪太重
Sorry, gents! My boobs make a promise

44
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,810
后背承受不来
my bad back can't deliver.

45
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:14,013
那些低销售额不是我们的错
Those bad sales numbers are not our fault.

46
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,848
我们的店可是开在机场啊
Our unit's out at the airport.

47
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:17,149
这不是我的责任
Well, I'm not taking ownership of this

48
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,218
因为我的宝贝不在机场
because my unit is not at the airport.

49
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,021
而是放在我的床头柜里
It's in my bed table drawer.

50
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:24,790
我是经理 都怨我
I'm the manager. It's on me.

51
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:28,260
就跟这污渍一样 就是洗不掉
As is this tartar stain. It just refuses to come out.

52
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:31,797
让人还以为它父母是基督徒(不敢出柜)
You'd think it's parents were Baptist.

53
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,101
那么 经理 我明天得早点下班
Well, Manager, I need to get out of there

54
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:36,869
做Sophie的结婚蛋糕
early tomorrow to do Sophie's wedding cake,

55
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,339
还因为你当老板超烦人的
and also because you're annoying as a boss.

56
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:42,807
嘿 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

57
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:50,516
一步 两步 三步 四步 是我 是我 还是我...
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me...

58
00:02:50,517 --> 00:02:54,086
我喜欢做新娘 你都不用假装
I love being a bride. You don't even have to pretend

59
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:56,855
对别人感兴趣了
it's about anyone else.

60
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:59,024
跟我有钱那会儿一样
Kinda like me, when I was rich.

61
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:02,161
你现在也没好到哪去
Pretty much every single day still.

62
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,630
一个好消息 一个坏消息 好消息是
Good news, bad news. The good news is

63
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:10,536
皮疹没有传染到下肢
the rash is not spreading past my nuts.

64
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:13,705
这竟然是好消息
And that's the good news.

65
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:16,108
坏消息... 我们预定仪式用的
Bad news... the wedding donkey we booked

66
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,578
婚驴死了
for the church service died.

67
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,747
我来问个显而易见的问题
I'll ask the obvious question.

68
00:03:21,748 --> 00:03:25,784
驴死跟皮疹有关吗?
Did it have anything to do with the rash?

69
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,619
我们该怎么办?
I mean, what are we gonna do?

70
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,154
没有畜生走过礼堂的婚礼
It's not a traditional Polish wedding

71
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:32,724
就不是传统的波兰婚礼
without an ass walking down the aisle.

72
00:03:32,725 --> 00:03:36,328
我觉得Oleg可以扮演畜生的角色
I think Oleg's got that covered.

73
00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:39,698
妹子 我们需要畜生 而你有匹马...
Girls, we need an ass, you have a horse...

74
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:41,633
同样的家庭 但不是血亲
same family, but not related,

75
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:46,104
就像朱莉-皮特家的孩子似的
like the Jolie-Pitt kids.

76
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:48,640
不行 小栗子是我的孩子
No way. Chestnut is my baby.

77
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,343
我们本来要付那驴一千大洋
Well, the donkey was getting a thousand bucks.

78
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,211
亲孩子也得干活
Baby's gotta work.

79
00:03:55,648 --> 00:03:57,415
天 卖蛋糕的速度比第三季
Wow, business is slower than the third season

80
00:03:57,416 --> 00:04:00,852
纸牌屋的节奏还慢
of House of Cards.

81
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,554
你知道什么受人欢迎吗?
You know what's doing great business?

82
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:06,491
就是我的新基达档案
It's my new Grindr profile.

83
00:04:06,492 --> 00:04:11,429
我把网名改成"舔鸡高手"了
Changed my screen name to "Suction Junction".

84
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,532
隔壁该死的肉桂蛋糕把我们的生意都抢走了
That damn Cinnabon next door is taking all our business.

85
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,434
什么样的屌丝会喜欢那个
What kind of low lives would prefer those

86
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:19,137
而不选我们精致的糕点呢?
to these fine desserts?

87
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:22,340
我找到去肉桂蛋糕厨房的密道了!
I found a secret pathway to the Cinnabon kitchen!

88
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:25,977
闪开 贱人!
Move, bitch!

89
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:28,880
不是吧? 连你也这样? 我不明白
Really? You too? I just don't get it.

90
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,950
这是嗜好 跟吸毒一样
It's an acquired taste, like crystal meth.

91
00:04:34,219 --> 00:04:35,687
真是
Ugh.

92
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:38,323
这下好了 服务生又迟到了
Great. My waiter's gonna be late again.

93
00:04:38,324 --> 00:04:40,191
"我被堵在安检队伍里了"
"Held up at the TSA line."

94
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,193
这就是我雇一个叫Mohammed Machdinajihad
That's what I get for hiring an airport waiter

95
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:44,594
机场侍应生的下场
named Mohammed Machdinajihad.

96
00:04:47,498 --> 00:04:49,233
哦 快看 Ronnie 新店哎
Oh, look, Ronnie, a new place.

97
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:52,570
我看到了 Bonnie 我就在你旁边你呢
I see it, Bonnie, I'm right next to you.

98
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,505
这过去不是我们起飞前
Didn't this used to be the bar we got wasted in

99
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,007
买醉的酒吧吗?
before our flights?

100
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,475
我记不得了 因为我喝醉了
I can't remember. I was wasted.

101
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:00,311
欢迎来到糕潮...
Welcome to The High...

102
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:03,147
高质量精致糕点
the finest in high quality desserts.

103
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:05,449
我们还有酸奶 卡布奇诺 拿铁 咖啡
We also have yogurts, cappuccinos, lattes, coffee,

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,951
草药茶 或者醒脑水
herb teas, or smart waters.

105
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:09,987
我有没有提到我们还有无线网热点?
And did I mention we're a Boingo Hotspot?

106
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,989
别这么激动
Take it down a notch.

107
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,491
你比在今夜秀上的安妮·海瑟薇
You're selling it harder than Anne Hathaway

108
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,559
还要卖力
on The Tonight Show.

109
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,928
哦 你好 我只是来看看 不买东西
Oh, hi, I'm not here to buy, just to look.

110
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:21,966
我在节食... 从九八年就开始了
On a diet... since 1998.

111
00:05:21,967 --> 00:05:23,500
老天啊 那些看起来好棒
Oh dear lord, those look amazing.

112
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,669
- 我能闻下吗?  - Bonnie 别
- Can I just smell a piece?  - Bonnie, don't.

113
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,938
你停不下来的 等巴黎航班飞到半程
It'll get you going, and then halfway to Paris,

114
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:31,475
我就会看到你在客舱里大口吃着薯片
I'll find you in coach binging on a bag of Sun Chips.

115
00:05:31,476 --> 00:05:33,210
我最喜欢我工作的这点了
That's my favorite thing about the job.

116
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:37,781
说起巴黎
Oh, Paris reminds me.

117
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,616
我买过两张去巴黎的头等舱票...
I bought two first class tickets to Paris...

118
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:41,418
用三张六年内利息增长百分之二十的
on three credit cards that will escalate 20%

119
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:43,253
信用卡买的... 总之...
over six years... anyway...

120
00:05:43,254 --> 00:05:44,855
我必须退掉它们
I really need to return them.

121
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:46,356
你们航空公司的退票期限是多久?
What's the window on that with your airline?

122
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,859
一个月... 跟我能长久保持
A month... about the same amount of time I have

123
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,029
这种假笑的时间是一样的
until this fake smile finally falls off my face.

124
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,697
女士 我们可是空姐
Lady, we're flight attendants.

125
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,365
如果你不能保持假笑的话
If that smile falls off your face,

126
00:05:55,366 --> 00:05:58,769
你就只能去西南航空找工作了
you're gonna have to get a job at Southwest.

127
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,525
你为什么要退掉? 你不喜欢巴黎?
Why are you returning them? You don't like Paris?

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:03,006
我爱死巴黎了 但长话短说...
J'adore Paris, but long story short...

129
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,808
我来说吧 因为她讲不清楚
Uh, I'll make it short because she's incapable

130
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,511
而且还会说更多糟糕的法语
and will throw in lots more of that fake French.

131
00:06:07,512 --> 00:06:09,442
当时买票是因为我要去登机口见一个
Bought the tickets so that I could get to the gate

132
00:06:09,443 --> 00:06:10,747
和我上床的男人
to see a guy I was banging.

133
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:12,349
我懂你
I hear ya.

134
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,184
我有次在行李车上藏了十二个小时
I once hid in the luggage cart for 12 hours

135
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,485
就为了跟一个在这里海关工作的
to do it with this cute guy

136
00:06:15,486 --> 00:06:16,953
帅小伙上床
who works at Customs here.

137
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:19,456
对 Rick 他现在在干什么?
Oh, right. Rick. What's he doing now?

138
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:20,957
干我啊 隔周周四
Me, every third Tuesday.

139
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,462
别让我等着 女士们
Ahh, don't leave me hanging, ladies.

140
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,030
如果我们不是刚在酒友俱乐部...
Ah. If we hadn't just read Lean In

141
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,699
我是说读书俱乐部... 读了"向前一步"
in our wine club... I mean book club...

142
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,768
我们会很嫉妒你们呢
we'd be real jealous of you gals.

143
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,937
我们一直梦想着在机场开一个小店
We always had a dream to open a shop at the airport.

144
00:06:33,938 --> 00:06:35,305
不管开什么店 都不要开在肉桂蛋糕店旁边
Well, whatever it is, just don't open

145
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:37,274
因为失败闻起来
near a Cinnabon because failure smells

146
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:39,709
跟肉桂一样难闻
a hell of a lot like cinnamon.

147
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,177
这是前往巴黎的
Final boarding call

148
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:43,380
第24次航班的最后登机通知
for flight 24 to Paris. Final boarding call.

149
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,749
最后登机通知? 我们得快点了
Final boarding call? We better hurry.

150
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,306
哇 这里的所有东西
Wow, everything looks so much smaller in here

151
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:05,908
比我记忆中的还要小
than I remembered it.

152
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,809
就像回高中母校的时候...
Like returning to your old high school...

153
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,979
或者是高中前男友的屌一样
or your old high school boyfriend's penis.

154
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,315
我的可不是 我去的是普通高中
Not mine. I went to an urban high school.

155
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:17,653
这是什么怪味道?
What's that weird smell?

156
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:19,821
可能是牛奶吧 放在这里太久了
Probably that milk. It's been in here so long,

157
00:07:19,822 --> 00:07:23,358
它自己的照片都印在盒子上了
its own photo was on the carton.

158
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:29,231
不 在这里 真的很刺鼻
No, it's over here. Really pungent.

159
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,232
太棒了!
Yes!

160
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:41,776
额... 我可能欠你俩点租金
Mm... I might owe you two some rent.

161
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,979
除非你们想引进大麻
Unless you wanna settle in weed.

162
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,581
我一直想引进大麻
I always wanna settle in weed.

163
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:49,484
实际上 我计划着退休后搬进大麻呢
In fact, I plan to retire there.

164
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:51,086
橱柜里有大麻?
Marijuana's in the closet?

165
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:54,154
这比Meredith Baxter-Birney出柜还令人震惊
This is more shocking than Meredith Baxter-Birney.

166
00:07:56,157 --> 00:07:59,461
我当时想 反正你俩放弃了纸杯蛋糕的生意
Look, I figured since you two abandoned the cupcake shop,

167
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,229
这地方又空着
this space was available.

168
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,231
而且 自从我到了七十岁
Also, I stopped asking permission for stuff

169
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,400
我再也不征求别人同意了
when I turned 70.

170
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,135
我们没有放弃
We did not abandon it.

171
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:09,070
我们只是三个月没有留意它了
We just haven't paid attention to it in 3 months,

172
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,739
就像我不留意大腿中部以上的任何毛发一样
like me with any hair above my mid-thigh.

173
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,907
可不是嘛
Tell me about it.

174
00:08:12,908 --> 00:08:14,609
你穿着那条裙子弯腰的时候
When you bend over in that skirt,

175
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,270
看起来像是阿特·加芬克尔正在从你两腿中间钻出来
it looks like you're giving birth to Art Garfunkel.

176
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:24,786
一 二 三 四 是我 是我 还是我!
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!

177
00:08:24,787 --> 00:08:27,555
太好了 Earl 你在这儿
Oh, good. Earl, you're here.

178
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:32,794
是的 我在这里 不要告诉我的前妻们哦
Yes, I am. Don't tell any of my ex-wives.

179
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,929
Earl 你肯赏光
Earl, would you do me the honor

180
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,565
明晚挽着我走过红毯吗?
and walk me down the aisle tomorrow night?

181
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,100
Sophie 真抱歉
Sophie, sorry.

182
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,568
我不知道你爸爸去世了
I didn't know your father was dead.

183
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:44,005
他是在和Oleg见面的时候去世的吗?
Did he die upon meeting Oleg?

184
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,640
不 他还活着
Oh, he's not dead,

185
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:49,542
但是我不想被一个铁肺呼吸器抢了风头
but I'm not getting upstaged by an iron lung.

186
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:52,980
Earl 你怎么能拒绝
Well, Earl, how could you say no

187
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,516
这么一个真诚的邀约呢?
to such a heartfelt request?

188
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,151
我很荣幸 Sophie
I'd be honored, Sophie.

189
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,586
就像婚礼谚语所说的
Like the wedding saying goes,

190
00:08:58,587 --> 00:09:00,821
一些旧的 一些新的
Something old, something new,

191
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:01,922
一些借来的 
something borrowed,

192
00:09:01,923 --> 00:09:05,292
和一个黑人
and someone black.

193
00:09:05,293 --> 00:09:07,094
Caroline 瞧
Oh, Caroline, look.

194
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:09,263
这是给小栗子的粉丝带
Here are the pink ribbons for Chestnut.

195
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:12,500
小栗子得裹上这些娘气的丝带?
Chestnut has to be covered in girly ribbons?

196
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,401
不能这么对我的小男子汉
I can't do that to my boy.

197
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,936
我加价50
I'll throw in another 50.

198
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:17,805
我想"马"和"妓女"听起来
I guess there's a reason "horse" sounds

199
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:20,441
这么相像是有原因的
so much like "whore."

200
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:23,911
嗯 我们都得六点出发去教堂
Now, we're all gonna leave for the church at 6:00,

201
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:26,213
但是我跟Earl说的是4点钟
but I told Earl 4:00,

202
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:29,816
因为 嗯... 你们懂的
'cause, well... You know.

203
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:38,692
- # 嗯哼哼哼 #  - 这是怎么回事?
- # Mm-hm hm hmm #  - What's happening over there?

204
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:40,127
Max 你在哼歌!
Max, you're humming!

205
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,428
什么?
What?

206
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:43,363
拜托...
Please...

207
00:09:43,364 --> 00:09:44,598
我不是那种会哼歌的人
I am not a hummer.

208
00:09:44,599 --> 00:09:45,833
我是说我可以开一辆悍马
I mean, I'll drive in them,

209
00:09:45,834 --> 00:09:49,570
可以送一辆 但是我自己不会哼歌
I'll give them, but I am not one.

210
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:54,041
天啊 我在哼歌! 我哪儿出了毛病?
Oh, my God, I am humming! What's wrong with me?

211
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:56,642
下一步我该做什么 微笑?
What am I gonna do next, smile?

212
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,680
就是这样! 今日特别优惠
That's right! Today's special promotion,

213
00:10:00,681 --> 00:10:03,183
进出只需五分钟 超时五折
in and out in five minutes or your dessert is half off.

214
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,485
瞧着吧 肉桂蛋糕店 
Eat it, Cinnabon.

215
00:10:05,486 --> 00:10:08,021
梨挞和咖啡 快来 这边记着时呢
Pear tart and a coffee. Come on, I'm on a clock here.

216
00:10:08,022 --> 00:10:10,624
谁点了该死的梨挞和咖啡?
Who had the damn pear tart and a coffee?

217
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,859
Max 赶紧的! 五分钟 进出!
Max, hurry! Five minutes, in and out!

218
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,530
嗯 你唯一不需要向我解释的事情
Yeah, the one thing you don't have to explain

219
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,229
就是"进出"
to me is "in and out."

220
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,331
我需要帮助! 我没说自己动作很快的
I need help! I never said I was fast.

221
00:10:18,332 --> 00:10:19,733
我所有的高中辅导员倒是卸货很快
All my high school guidance counselors did,

222
00:10:19,734 --> 00:10:21,368
但我不是啊
but I did not.

223
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:22,736
我去把正在休息的John叫来
I'll go get John off break

224
00:10:22,737 --> 00:10:24,170
因为我的服务生还没来
because my waiter still isn't here.

225
00:10:24,171 --> 00:10:25,472
这整个的中东麻烦
This whole Middle East situation

226
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:28,173
简直对我太不方便了
is just so inconvenient for me.

227
00:10:30,276 --> 00:10:32,112
好吧 我们现在真的出了点状况
Okay, now we have a real situation.

228
00:10:32,113 --> 00:10:34,147
你打人了 该死 Max
You hit someone. Damn it, Max.

229
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:36,149
不是我 是Sophie
It's not about me. It's Sophie.

230
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,617
她的礼服从波兰运过来了
Her gown arrived from Poland

231
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:40,487
但是卡在这边的海关了
and it's stuck in customs out here.

232
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:41,955
我的礼服!
My gown!

233
00:10:41,956 --> 00:10:43,623
我美丽的礼服!
My beautiful gown!

234
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:46,893
天啊! 我的礼服!
Oh, my God! My gown!

235
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:48,895
好吧 她真的很生气
Wow. She is really upset.

236
00:10:48,896 --> 00:10:50,363
是超级生气
Really upset,

237
00:10:50,364 --> 00:10:53,165
因为我都没开扬声器
'cause this isn't even on speaker.

238
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,437
是啊 很糟糕 但乐观点
Yes, it's awful, but look on the bright side.

239
00:10:57,438 --> 00:10:59,672
我们那些绝对十分丑陋的伴娘礼服
Our certain-to-be-hideous bridesmaids dresses

240
00:10:59,673 --> 00:11:01,307
也一起卡在了海关
are stuck in customs too.

241
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,676
不 那些已经到了
No, those arrived.

242
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,578
该死! 先是中东麻烦
Damn it! First, it's the Middle East,

243
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,746
现在是那些礼服
now those dresses.

244
00:11:06,747 --> 00:11:09,247
我都没法休息了
I cannot catch a break.

245
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:12,085
哇 这地方人满为患啊
Wow, this place is packed.

246
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,753
还记得我们吗? Bonnie和Ronnie?
Remember us? Bonnie and Ronnie?

247
00:11:13,754 --> 00:11:15,755
我们见过的
We knew you when.

248
00:11:15,756 --> 00:11:17,256
嘿 等等 呃 Ronnie
Hey, wait, uh, Ronnie,

249
00:11:17,257 --> 00:11:19,192
你是不是说过你上过一个海关小哥?
didn't you say that you boned a guy in customs?

250
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:21,494
那是Bonnie 我是有原则的...
That was Bonnie. I have standards...

251
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:24,130
而且他也不喜欢我
and he didn't like me.

252
00:11:24,131 --> 00:11:26,599
明白点说 我确实和海关小哥做过
To be clear, I did have sex with the customs guy,

253
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,000
但不是在海关
but not in customs.

254
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:31,070
是在一间母婴厕所里
It was in one of those family bathrooms.

255
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,872
听着 你们可不可能帮我们
Look, is there any way you could help us

256
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:34,640
从海关那边弄出一个包裹呢?
get a package out of customs?

257
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:37,109
等等... 我今天穿了什么内衣?
Wait... What bra am I wearing?

258
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:38,678
手到擒来!
Oh, done!

259
00:11:40,213 --> 00:11:43,582
John 我们要走了 你来负责
John, we're leaving. You're in charge.

260
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,584
Max! 我们现在可不能走
Max! We can't leave right now.

261
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:47,514
婚礼今晚才举行 我们现在还在
The wedding's not till tonight and we're in the middle

262
00:11:47,515 --> 00:11:49,488
店铺促销中 而且我们要输了
of a store promotion and we're losing.

263
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,590
你知道我会杀了你的吧?
You know I'm gonna kill you, right?

264
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:53,125
只不过要想想怎么下手
I just have to figure out how.

265
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,660
让头号对手把你的项链
Top contender is hooking your necklace

266
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:56,862
拴在前门 再把你推上去
on the front gate and pushing up.

267
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,597
我们尽量待晚点
We'll stay as late as possible.

268
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:01,467
只要抄起装Sophie婚纱的盒子 然后跳上地铁就行了
Just pick up Sophie's dress box and hop on the subway.

269
00:12:01,468 --> 00:12:06,305
小菜一碟
Easy peasy.

270
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:08,013
关门请当心
Watch the closing doors, please.

271
00:12:08,014 --> 00:12:09,308
呃... 哦...
Ugh... oho...

272
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:11,944
为什么就是不能来个一碟小菜?
Why is nothing easy peasy?

273
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:22,947
关门请当心
Watch the closing doors, please.

274
00:12:22,948 --> 00:12:24,682
我可当心呢!
I am watching the doors!

275
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:26,717
怎么会不当心 它们快把我的盒子吃了
It's hard not to. They're about to eat my box.

276
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,255
对 真好笑 先生
Yeah, real funny, sir.

277
00:12:31,256 --> 00:12:33,916
有个女孩说"吃了我的盒子" 成熟点吧
A girl said, "Eat my box." Grow up.

278
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:38,896
天! 一件婚纱怎么会大到这样?
Jeez! How could a dress be this big?

279
00:12:38,897 --> 00:12:41,932
这还只是头纱
This is just the veil.

280
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,200
我得从包里掏点东西
I have to get something out of my bag.

281
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,735
你先自己撑会
Hold this by yourself for a second.

282
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:50,374
找不到了 这个 帮我拿着这个
I can't find it. Here, take this.

283
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,875
这又是什么?
What is this?

284
00:12:51,876 --> 00:12:53,544
一百刀的零钱
A hundred dollars in change.

285
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,389
婚礼上用的 波兰传统是
We need it for the wedding. It's a Polish custom

286
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,446
要把零钱撒到新娘身上
to throw change at the bride.

287
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,849
撒零钱? 带牲畜?
Loose change? Live animals?

288
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,319
究竟是结婚还是斗鸡啊?
Is this a wedding or a cock fight?

289
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,754
Max 好重啊!
Max, this is heavy!

290
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:05,222
你到底要在包里掏什么呀?
What do you have to get out of your bag?

291
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:07,724
- 很重要的东西  - 什么呀?
- Something important.  - What is it?

292
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:10,060
我吃剩的肉桂蛋糕
The rest of my Cinnabon.

293
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,962
Max 那可是我们的对头!
Max, that's our competition!

294
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:13,997
我们就是输在这垃圾上
The reason for our failure is that piece of crap.

295
00:13:13,998 --> 00:13:15,565
我是说...
I mean, I ca...

296
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:18,934
我的神呀 好吃到飞起!
Oh, my God, this is delicious!

297
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,439
不! Max 他拿了我们的钱包
No! Max, he's got the money bag.

298
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:27,744
不... 不! 不许捡!
No... No! No, no, no!

299
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:30,313
这是我们波兰新娘的钱!
That is our Polish bride money!

300
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:31,748
都退开!
Back off!

301
00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:33,450
今天谁都不许跟我搞事儿
This is not the day to the screw with me.

302
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:34,851
我已经跌到事业谷底
I'm at the business bottom

303
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:37,587
而且2011年来我就没啥可失去了
and I've had nothing to lose since 2011.

304
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,761
皇后广场到了
Queen's Plaza.

305
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:48,498
好呀 屋漏偏逢连夜雨
Yup. That's what would happen next.

306
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:58,441
她们在后台磨蹭什么?
What's the hold up back there?

307
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:00,710
大家在赌我会不会卷了婚礼礼金
People are placing bets that I'm halfway to Reno

308
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:03,613
再带个妓女去里诺
with a hooker and the wedding cash.

309
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:03,613
{\an8}里诺: 美国内华达州的赌城

310
00:14:03,614 --> 00:14:05,415
放轻松 从地铁上下来
Relax. After that subway,

311
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:08,117
Max和Caroline要点时间梳妆打扮
Max and Caroline needed some time to freshen up.

312
00:14:08,118 --> 00:14:10,363
她们来的时候 臭的就像那块
They came smelling like that diner cheese

313
00:14:10,364 --> 00:14:13,966
我跟你说还能凑合用的奶酪
I tell you all is still good.

314
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:17,236
嘿 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

315
00:14:17,237 --> 00:14:20,206
我们简直是Sophie第二! 我松了一口大气啊
We look just like Sophie! I am so relieved.

316
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:23,776
还以为我会穿得太隆重 结果只是胸不够重
I thought I'd be way overdressed but I'm just under-boobed.

317
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:25,077
没错 我们太赶时间了
Yeah, we were in a hurry

318
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,912
要不然我肯定会"借她一码"
or I would have loaned her a cup of mine.

319
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:29,315
不错啊
All right.

320
00:14:29,316 --> 00:14:31,784
Oleg 别这么看我们
Oleg, stop looking at us like that.

321
00:14:31,785 --> 00:14:35,454
有啥关系 我要跟你结婚的
It's okay. I'm marrying you.

322
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:38,190
你们几个看起来就像四大高人
You guys look like the Four Tops.

323
00:14:35,455 --> 00:14:38,190
{\an8}Four Tops: 美国1953-1997年间的一个摇滚乐队

324
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:41,592
好吧 只有两个高人和一个垫底的
Well, two tops and a bottom.

325
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:47,132
Sophie不想让你见到她 Oleg
Oleg, Sophie doesn't want you to see her.

326
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:49,535
骑上小栗子走婚毯吧
Jump on Chestnut and start down the aisle.

327
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,470
小栗子 我对不住你 宝贝
And Chestnut, I'm sorry, baby.

328
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:56,007
我知道你从来不想驮人
I know you never wanted to do drag.

329
00:14:57,076 --> 00:14:58,944
Han 你得拿着这个
And, Han, you're supposed to take this

330
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,780
以防马在路上屎兴大发
in case something happens in the aisle.

331
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:05,317
伴郎变铲屎郎啦
This just went from best man to worst job.

332
00:15:19,765 --> 00:15:21,432
# 嘿! #
# Hey! #

333
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:26,505
嗨
Hi.

334
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:28,073
觉得怎么样 女孩们?
What do you think, girls?

335
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:31,810
我看起来像纯洁吗?
Do I look like a virgin?

336
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,015
我听见号声了 该我上场! 上啊 女孩们 上!
I heard the tubas. That's my cue! Go, girls. Go!

337
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,589
天啊!
Oh, God!

338
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,191
她的礼服差点害死我们
Her dress almost killed us

339
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,992
现在真害死Earl了
and now it killed Earl.

340
00:16:24,128 --> 00:16:25,663
太感谢了
Thanks.

341
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:28,031
还以为我死定了呢
I thought I was a goner.

342
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:35,206
该说誓词了
Time for the vows.

343
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:39,744
呈上皇冠!
Bring the crowns!

344
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:42,246
戴冠之人
And crowned is married...

345
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:47,250
喜结连理
with honor.

346
00:16:48,819 --> 00:16:51,055
哦...
Ohhh...

347
00:16:51,056 --> 00:16:54,591
将皇冠举于新人头顶
Raise the crowns to their heads.

348
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,737
开始吧 没有梯子的话
Better go. This is as good as

349
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,973
这已经是最好的办法了
it's gonna get without a ladder.

350
00:17:11,308 --> 00:17:15,712
我 Sophie Kachinsky...
I, Sophie Kachinsky...

351
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:24,688
愿意嫁Oleg Golishevsky为妻

誓言忠于彼此
never to leave your side

355
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:36,233

誓言忠于彼此
never to leave your side

361
00:17:49,113 --> 00:17:52,314
至死也不分离
'til death comes to take me.

362
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:59,156
我宣布你们正式结为夫妻!
I pronounce you husband and wife!

363
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:05,928
Max 该丢硬币了
Max, now you throw the coins.

364
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,800
说来话长
Long story.

365
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:17,073
哇 小妞 手脚挺利索的嘛
Wow, girl, your fingers work fast.

366
00:18:17,074 --> 00:18:19,209
肯定是多年
Must be from years

367
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,112
开裤裆拉链练就的手活...
of opening those 501 button-fly jeans...

368
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:24,180
我的 还有别人的
Mine and others'.

369
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:26,249
Max 我等够了 我现在就要
Max, I'm done waiting. I need that piece

370
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,784
那片蛋糕
of cake right now.

371
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,452
刚刚在空中真是惊险
We just had a close call in the air.

372
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,588
惊险到我们险些把手指
So close, we gave the finger to the pilot

373
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:34,290
献给隔壁飞机的驾驶员了
in the plane next to us.

374
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,592
我们差点坠机了 而且我可不想
We almost crashed, and I didn't wanna

375
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,060
在飞机坠落时喊
go down screaming,

376
00:18:37,061 --> 00:18:39,596
"我真该开家日间托儿所!"
"I should have opened a daycare center!"

377
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:44,100
我坠机一般会喊"你没给咱买晚饭!"
I usually go down screaming, "You didn't buy me dinner!"

378
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:45,468
Bonnie 我们承认吧
Bonnie, let's admit it.

379
00:18:45,469 --> 00:18:47,036
我们永远不会为梦想放手一搏的
We're never gonna go for our dream,

380
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,806
就像我们一直没去洗肠一样
just like we never went to get those colonics.

381
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,875
如果我们真有做生意的心
If we really wanted our own business,

382
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:55,177
早就开店了 就像Max和Caroline这样
we would have done it already, like Max and Caroline did.

383
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:58,414
你说得对 我们开了
You're right, we did.

384
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,217
John 给这两位女士
John, cut these two the biggest piece

385
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,853
切两块这里最大的椰果坚果果仁蛋糕
of coconut macadamia nut cake we have.

386
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:07,056
天呐 我刚刚好像"高潮"了
Oh my god. I think I just climaxed.

387
00:19:07,057 --> 00:19:09,192
那就提好裤腰带
Well, then pull your panties on

388
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,961
像你过去那样溜之大吉
and slink the hell out like you usually do.

389
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:16,732
Caroline 我要找你说句话
Caroline, I need to talk to you.

390
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:18,067
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

391
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:21,170
工作! 我累死了
Working! I'm very sick.

392
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:24,207
外面的Bonnie和Ronnie提醒了我一件事
Bonnie and Ronnie out there just reminded me of something.

393
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,009
除了我的两位姨度假喝醉那事
I mean, besides two aunts drunk on vacation.

394
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,280
我们有自己的小生意 "糕潮"不是我们的失败
We have our own business. The High isn't our failure.

395
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:33,449
我们已经有过咱们自己的失败了
We already have our very own failure

396
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,651
就叫"Max自制纸杯蛋糕"店
called Max's Homemade Cupcakes.

397
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,119
而且我们若留下来
And if we stay here, we're building

398
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,789
就是为别人做嫁衣
someone else's dream, not ours.

399
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:40,956
还有就是 我们要是留了
Also, if we stay,

400
00:19:40,957 --> 00:19:44,426
你的屁股就有房子这么大了
your ass will be the size of a house.

401
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:47,963
还有 你最近一次在这感到开心是什么时候?
I mean, when was the last time you felt happy here?

402
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:50,399
就在30秒前 你说这地方
Like 30 seconds ago when you said this place

403
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,301
不是我们的失败所在的时候 我还记得
wasn't our failure and I remembered I was holding

404
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:56,005
我另一只手还拿着块蛋糕呢
another one of these in my other hand.

405
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,506
咱们离开这机场吧
Let's get out of this airport.

406
00:19:57,507 --> 00:20:00,643
咱们再也不用看尼古拉斯·斯帕克斯写的纯爱小说了
We never have to see another Nicholas Sparks novel again.

407
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,077
首先 咱们得花掉
First, we have to get rid

408
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,113
那两张去巴黎的机票
of those two plane tickets to Paris.

409
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:07,648
真的吗?
Do we?

410
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:11,186
我想说 万一失败了
I mean, if we're gonna fail

411
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,622
咱们在巴黎待上一周后还可以继续做吧?
we can still do that after a week in Paris, right?

412
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:15,324
对哒
Right.

413
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:17,826
我好激动呃! 人家还没坐过头等舱呢
I'm so stoked! I've never been in first class.

414
00:20:17,827 --> 00:20:21,196
只不过 Max 这是二等舱
Except, Max, this is coach.

415
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:23,432
我退了一张票 换了另一张票
I got a refund on one ticket and traded in the other

416
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:26,535
然后买了两张二等舱的票 还付了廉价酒店的房钱
to buy two coach tickets and to pay for a cheap hotel.

417
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:28,604
我好激动呃 人家从没坐过二等舱呢
I'm so stoked. I've never been in coach.

418
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,205
这样一来
And also so

419
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,673
咱们就有多余的钱花了
we have money to spend.

420
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:34,176
咱们到了巴黎后 每周只花12刀应该过得去
We should be able to do Paris for a week on $12.

421
00:20:34,177 --> 00:20:37,112
那是当然啦
Of course, we can.

422
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:40,048
头等舱和二等舱之间有啥区别来着?
What's the difference between coach and first, anyway?

423
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:41,883
附送香槟
The champagne.

424
00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:43,785
我们稍后为您送上优质饼干(疯子)
We'll be back with the good crackers,

425
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,353
我说的不是我们俩
and I don't mean us.

426
00:20:49,758 --> 00:20:51,493
好啦 合伙人 在这一年里
Well, partner, after all we've been

427
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:53,662
经历了这么多风雨 不管接下来如何
through this year, whatever comes next,

428
00:20:53,663 --> 00:20:55,630
我感觉自己都做好准备了
I kinda feel ready for it.

429
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:58,333
机务人员 准备起飞
Flight crew, prepare for take-off.

430
00:21:02,171 --> 00:21:04,539
嘿 你在哼歌
Hey, now you're humming.

431
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,807
有吗?
I am?

432
00:21:11,546 --> 00:21:14,915
嘿 我可以拿这个换啤酒不?
Hey, can I trade this in for a beer?
