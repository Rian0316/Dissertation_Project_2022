1
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,410

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,280
All right, I'm ready for my next question.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,010
In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets,

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,020
who wins the Second World War?

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,220
Uganda.

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,220
Defend.

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,690
Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses.

8
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,890
A Central African power block is formed,

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,000
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,430
When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,800
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,940
Correct.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,240
My turn.

14
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,280
In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument,

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,080
on what does Scott Joplin play "The Maple Leaf Rag"?

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,080

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,850
Tuned bayonets.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,920
Defend.

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,850
Isn't it obvious?

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,420
You're right. My apologies.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,460
What the hell are you guys playing?

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,200
It's a game we invented.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,400
It's called Counterfactuals.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,770
We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours

25
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,300
in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,140
It's fun for ages eight to 80.

27
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,570
Join us.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,080
All right.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,540
I like a good brainteaser.

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,140
Give it a whirl.

31
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,710
You're in luck, this is an easy one.

32
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,290
In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver,

33
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,750
what food is no longer consumed?

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,660
Uh... a BLT where the "B" stands for beaver?

35
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,890
I don't know.

36
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,960
Leonard, be serious.

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,730
We're playing a game here.

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,830
I can figure this out. Let's see.

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,600
Um, well, beavers eat tree bark.

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,010
The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon.

41
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,310
So, I'll say cinnamon.

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,340
Incorrect.

43
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,850
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

44
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,180
What?

45
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,920
In a world ruled by a giant beaver,

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,190
mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord.

47
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,590
The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded.

48
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,860
Thousands die.

49
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,930
Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry.

50
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,930
How does one miss that?

51
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,300
This is ridiculous.

52
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,840
You're just making stuff up.

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,170
Is he always like this when he loses?

54
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,570
Oh, yes.

55
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,410
You should've been here for the great giant tantrum of 2008.

56
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,480
You bumped the table and you know it.

57
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,520
Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities.

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,330
We'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.

59
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm going to my room.

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,660
Very good, Leonard.

61
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:42,030
But next time, don't tell us where you're hiding.

62
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,500
Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids?

63
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,360
It's pretty interesting.

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,940
This guy's working from a hypothesis where...

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.

66
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,710
- What?  - Don't ruin it for me, man.

67
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,540
I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

68
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,650
On the potty? What are you, five?

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:27,650
It's a potty. What do you call it?

70
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,650
Toilet.

71
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,780
That's a little vulgar for the dinner table, don't you think?

72
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,890
Oh, and "potty" is okay?

73
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,020
"Potty" is innocent. "Potty" is adorable.

74
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,790
What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?

75
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,130
If I don't have to boom-boom.

76
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,500
Greetings.

77
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,670
You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.

78
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,870
- Nice to see you.  - Hello.

79
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,400
Sorry we're late.

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,970
I must take responsibility.

81
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,640
I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.

82
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,810
- Aha.  - Okay.

83
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,970
I believe she's experiencing her menses.

84
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,010
Actually, I'm not.

85
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,980
In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time.

86
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,180
- Aha.  - Okay.

87
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,550
"Toilet's" sounding pretty good now, huh?

88
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,990
Hey, look, it's Shamy.

89
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,320
Shamy?

90
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,490
A juvenile amalgamation of our names.

91
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,030
Sheldon, Amy-- Shamy.

92
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,360
Oh.

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,400
I don't like that. Don't do that.

94
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,500
All righty. What's new?

95
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,300
Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy,

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
and I don't like that.

97
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,940
I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, how's your life?

98
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,740
Like everybody else's.

99
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,880
Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death.

100
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,550
Thank you for asking.

101
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,350
Why is she not taking our order?

102
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,550
I should've warned you,

103
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,020
one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense

104
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,690
before one can be fed here.

105
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,730
Really? I assumed an establishment called

106
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,530
the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.

107
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,830
It's how they lure you in.

108
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,100
I believe it's called "bait and switch."

109
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,970
Okay, I'm just gonna walk away,

110
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,070
'cause... I don't want to be here.

111
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,010
So, this is nice.

112
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,850
First time we've all gotten together to eat.

113
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,150
You're right, he's a festival of humdrum chitchat.

114
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,120
Okay, that's all I got.

115
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,390
Howard, you're up.

116
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,890
Um... tell us about your work, Amy.

117
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,590
I doubt you'd understand.

118
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,330
Sheldon tells me you only have a master's degree.

119
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,730
Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?

120
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,140
I'm curious as to why we're not eating alone.

121
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,210
They can't function without me.

122
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,050
I'm the social glue that holds this little group together.

123
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,520
You're welcome.

124
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,790
Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?

125
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,590
She's not my girlfriend.

126
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,520
She's a girl and she's my friend,

127
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,260
but there's no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva.

128
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,130
Got it.

129
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,100
Although, for the record, on one occasion,

130
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,740
she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly

131
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,600
from the corner of my mouth.

132
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,010
It's an action we both regret to this day.

133
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,110
Uh-huh.

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,440
Anyway, I'm not sure she's the best fit

135
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
for our little-- how should we call it-- rebel alliance.

136
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,480
Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance.

137
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,890
Despite their tendency to build Death Stars,

138
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,150
I've always been more of an empire man.

139
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,090
Yeah, not my point.

140
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,330
I know what your point is.

141
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,360
You're intimidated by Amy's intellect.

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,830
To that I say, buck up.

143
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,130
Okay, let me just get right to it.

144
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,470
Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly...

145
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,740
just obnoxious.

146
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,510
So?

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,880
So we already have you for all that.

148
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,480
Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?

149
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
No, no, of course not.

150
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,990
Just have your relationship someplace else.

151
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,590
May I point out that for eight long months,

152
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,460
I suffered in silence as your female companion

153
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,530
filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling,

154
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,210
the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone

155
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,270
against her calloused feet in our living room,

156
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,250
and night after night of uninformative

157
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,210
TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore.

158
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,510
Suffered in silence?

159
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,520
Yes.

160
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,790
And I'd thank you to do the same.

161
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,720
Reall-- Silence?!

162
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,400
Nothing makes beer taste better

163
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,300
than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water.

164
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,400
Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?

165
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,070
Philadelphia.

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,110
Really?

167
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,540
I thought they were out West someplace.

168
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,680
Think about it, Raj.

169
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,050
Where did the movie Rocky take place?

170
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,620
Philadelphia.

171
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,590
Okay, now I get it.

172
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,150
So this is the plan?

173
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,610
From now on,

174
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,290
we're just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?

175
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,890
I'm very comfortable here.

176
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:11,430
Penny, dear, why don't you shoot another silver bullet my way?

177
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,470
Get one yourself.

178
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,740
Ooh, somebody's been taking bitchy pills.

179
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,370
God, he's an ass when he drinks.

180
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,740
Oh, he's an ass when he doesn't.

181
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,940
You just don't hear it.

182
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,880
Think we need to start entertaining the possibility

183
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,750
that the Shamy could go on for years.

184
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,450
Well, if that's the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV

185
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,150
and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place.

186
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,190
I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.

187
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,060
- I did.  - Well, what'd he say?

188
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,200
Well, he pointed out that he kinda sorta had to...

189
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,670
put up with you.

190
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,630
Kinda sorta had to?

191
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,940
I didn't agree with him.

192
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Well, you defended me, right?

193
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,770
I tried, but...

194
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,600
...he made a fairly well-reasoned argument.

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,870
You're not doing that right.

196
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:03,870
What?

197
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,100
Gimme.

198
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,340
- No.  - Trust me.

199
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,040
- No!  - I do this for my mom all the time.

200
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,210
See?

201
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,350
With the grain.

202
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,950
Wow, that is better.

203
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,390
And someday, when you have varicose veins,

204
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,290
I'll show you how to massage them.

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,270
Oh, God, never again.

206
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,240
I assume by "never again," you mean never again will you drink

207
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,640
all of Penny's beer, then run down to the gas station

208
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,840
for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims

209
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,780
and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks.

210
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,950
I was homesick.

211
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,050
The highlight of the evening was when you showed us

212
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,150
your Bollywood break dancing skills.

213
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,900
That's very offensive.

214
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah, we all thought so.

215
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh, no.

216
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
What?

217
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,670
It's John and Yoko.

218
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,410
More like Yoko and Yoko.

219
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,110
Greetings. Hey.

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,030
I brought Amy here

221
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,270
to show her some of the work I'm doing.

222
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,670
It's very impressive, for theoretical work.

223
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,810
Do I detect a hint of condescension?

224
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,010
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

225
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,450
I meant compared to the real-world applications

226
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,480
of neurobiology, theoretical physics is--

227
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
what's the word I'm looking for?-- hmm, cute.

228
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,390
Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist

229
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,760
like Babinski could ever rise to the significance

230
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,760

231
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,100
of a physicist like Clark Maxwell or Dirac?

232
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,100

233
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
I'm stating it outright.

234
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast

235
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,700
and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.

236
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,710
You take that back.

237
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,580
Absolutely not.

238
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,810
My colleagues and I are mapping

239
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,780
the neurological substrates that subserve

240
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,950
global information processing,

241
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,050
which is required for all cognitive reasoning,

242
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,750
including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto

243
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,090
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

244
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,790
That means it's better than his research,

245
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,790
and by extension, of course, yours.

246
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm still trying

247
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,900
to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, so...

248
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,440
Excuse me, but a grand unified theory,

249
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,010
insofar as it explains everything,

250
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,080
will ipso facto explain neurobiology.

251
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,680
Yes, but if I'm successful,

252
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,180
I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes

253
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,090
in deriving a grand unified theory,

254
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,950
and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm.

255
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,490
That's the rankest psychologism,

256
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,890
and was conclusively revealed as hogwash

257
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,030
by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!

258
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,130
We appear to have reached an impasse.

259
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,800
I agree.

260
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,440
I move our relationship terminate immediately.

261
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Seconded.

262
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,540
There being no objections...

263
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,980
...the motion carries.

264
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,950
Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.

265
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,950
Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

266
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,960
Women, huh?

267
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,490
Can't live with them,

268
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,890
can't successfully refute their hypotheses.

269
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,060
Amen to that.

270
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,970
Hey, Sheldon.

271
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,610
Hello.

272
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,340
I hear you broke up with Amy.

273
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,780
A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend.

274
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,380
She was a girl who was my friend

275
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,820
who is now a girl who is not my friend.

276
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,420
Wow. That's like the worst country song ever.

277
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,690
So, how are you doing?

278
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,960
Regarding what?

279
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,100
Amy.

280
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,200
I don't follow.

281
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,440
Well, breakups-- or whatever the hell this is-- can be tough.

282
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

283
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,610
My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual,

284
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,050
There were no emotional bonds,

285
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,380
the severing of which would cause me any discomfort.

286
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,050
The relationship simply outlived its utility,

287
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,020
and I'm continuing on with my life as before.

288
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,920
Okay. Good.

289
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,760
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to buy a pussycat.

290
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,630
I gotta tell you guys,

291
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,030
We're all a little worried about Sheldon.

293
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,070
No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef.

294
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,340
Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization:

295
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,770
"You know, I'm worried about Sheldon

296
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,980
"someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device

297
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,710
because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."

298
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,110
What does "hit a reef" mean?

299
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,650
Uh, went splitsville.

300
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,650
Pardon?

301
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,220
Turned to boom-boom.

302
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,460
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

303
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,730
You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.

304
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,900
He got a cat to keep him company.

305
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You're kidding.

306
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,170
He takes it everywhere:

307
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,000
to bed, to the bathroom.

308
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,970
He takes the kitty to the potty?

309
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,570
I thought we discussed the P-word.

310
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,140
Don't try to change me, dude.

311
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,140
I am what I am.

312
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,450
Oh, gentlemen.

313
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,510
Hey. Aren't you going to introduce us

314
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,180
to your little friend?

315
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,650
My apologies.

316
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,420
Raj, Howard, I'd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

317
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,690
Hello. Hi.

318
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,960
Now, if you'll excuse me,

319
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,500
the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk.

320
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,600
Okay, I get it. We're worried about Sheldon.

321
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,070
Yeah.

322
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,910
Hey.

323
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,440
Oh, no.

324
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,050
Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.

325
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,580
So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?

326
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,580

327
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,620
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman,

328
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,690
Edward Teller,

329
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,020
Otto Frisch

330
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,890
and Zazzles.

331
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:01,990
Zazzles?

332
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,830
I was going to name him Hermann von Helmholtz,

333
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,360
but he's so zazzy.

334
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,540
Okay, we need to talk.

335
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,770
About what?

336
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,410
Cats, Sheldon.

337
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,410
You're clearly upset about Amy being gone,

338
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,110
and you're trying to replace her with a bunch of cats.

339
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,710
- Clowder. - What?

340
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,080
A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.

341
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,120
Okay, yeah, fine.

342
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,820
It's the kind of thing you ought to know

343
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,490
now that we have one.

344
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,760
Terrific. My point is, you need to face up

345
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,730
to what you're feeling with this breakup.

346
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,960
It wasn't a breakup.

347
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,860
A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.

348
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,400
Okay, I got it, I got it; she's not your girlfriend.

349
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,770
Now listen to me.

350
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,340
I know about loneliness.

351
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,670
I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff.

352
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,570
When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello,

353
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,680
I built a bunch of model rockets,

354
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,210
I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell.

355
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,580
You didn't break up, she dumped you.

356
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,520
She didn't dump me.

357
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,920
It was mutual!

358
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,590
I was there. She dumped you.

359
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,960
Okay, fine.

360
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,260
Live with cats.

361
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,530
Be like my Aunt Nancy.

362
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,890
She had dozens of them.

363
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,360
And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her.

364
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,030
You don't have to sell me on cats, Leonard.

365
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,270
I'm already a fan.

366
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,940

367
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,940
All right, fellas, who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

368
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,910
Well, that's not fancy at all.

369
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,290
Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

370
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,350
Where is he?

371
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,520
He's in his bedroom.

372
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,320
Now, when you said on the phone

373
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,830
he broke up with a girl, you meant an actual girl,

374
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,330
not something you kids whipped up in a lab?

375
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,860
No, she's real.

376
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:48,900
Did they sin?

377
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,930
No, no, it's not like that.

378
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,040
It's, uh...

379
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,740
I don't know what it's like.

380
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,670
But there is something I should prepare you for.

381
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,340
Oh, relax, Leonard, I have raised that boy.

382
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,880
I've seen him at his best, I've seen him at his worst.

383
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,520
There's nothing he can do that'll surprise me.

384
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,350
Hold on to that thought.

385
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,150
Come in.

386
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,130
Surprise.

387
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,930
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

388
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,770
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

389
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,770
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky,

390
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,510
Feynman, Weisskopf...

391
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,670
Yeah, I get it.

392
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,440
You got a lot of cats

393
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,480
and you gave 'em cute Jewish names.

394
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,350
What are you doing here?

395
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,580
Leonard called.

396
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,820
And he said that you were pining for a young lady.

397
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,620
Oh, that's preposterous.

398
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,650
I'm not pining over anyone.

399
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,760
Oh, lambchop, we can quibble what to call it,

400
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,330
but I think we can both agree it's creepy.

401
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,430
I do not agree.

402
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:54,800
Cats make wonderful companions.

403
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,070
They don't argue or question my intellectual authority,

404
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,940
and this little guy here,

405
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,210
I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

406
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,980
You should have called sooner.

407
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,320
Shelly! Dinner's ready!

408
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,350
Coming!

409
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,620
No cats!

410
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,590
What is she doing here?

411
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,890
I called her.

412
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,930
Your mother thinks

413
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,900
you might be losing your mind over me.

414
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,530
As a neurobiologist, I was curious.

415
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,240
Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties.

416
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,340
25 cats!

417
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,640
Oh, God bless you, dear.

418
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,010
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

419
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,810
All right, but you're not fooling me.

420
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,050
Whenever you say we have to talk,

421
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,280
it means you want me to listen.

422
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,280
Then stop talking.

423
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,090
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,190
Now, the reason I called Amy over was

425
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,760
to find out what type of person she is.

426
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,430
And after chatting a bit,

427
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:57,760
I have to say that while she is a

428
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,270
perfectly unique young woman,

429
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,770
you two are definitely not suited for each other.

430
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,570
That's a peculiar conclusion.

431
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,040
By any standard, Amy is more similar to me

432
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,340
than anyone I've ever met.

433
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,140
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.

434
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,050
Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant.

435
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,050
I can't see subatomic particles,

436
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,920
but nevertheless, they're there.

437
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,020
Excellent point.

438
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,750
A physics point.

439
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,290
Touche

440
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,630
Well, putting aside the pig Latin,

441
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,460
it's a good thing that

442
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,430
you two decided to end the relationship

443
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,870
so I didn't have to end it for you.

444
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,900
Amy, after consideration,

445
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,100
I believe we may have acted rashly.

446
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,970
I propose we resume our relationship

447
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,480
and attempt to resolve our differences.

448
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,410
I'll agree to that only if you'll stipulate

449
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,510
that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.

450
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,320
- I'll go as high as 40. - Sixty-five.

451
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,850
Done.

452
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,850
You understand that moving forward,

453
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,320
we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?

454
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,290
I do. I find being cast

455
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,990
in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.

456
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,400
Would you like to see my cats?

457
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,530
I would. I love cats.

458
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,870
They're the epitome of indifference.

459
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,670
Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying.

460
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,540
I saw what you did there.

461
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,610
He thinks he's such a smarty pants.

462
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,010
He's no different from any man.

463
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,930
You tell 'em not to do something,

464
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,350
certainly that's all  they want to do.

465
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,850
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy

466
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,820
not to clear out the wood chipper by hand,

467
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,390
we'd still be calling him Edward.

468
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,160
Now, don't you move.

469
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll bring over all the food.

470
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,860
No, no, no, I can do it.

471
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,860
Well, isn't that sweet?

472
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,630
Thank you, Amy.

473
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,140
Here's your cat.

474
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,940
And here's your $20.

475
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,570
Next!

476
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,510
Thank you, Amy.

477
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:58,710
Here's your cat.

478
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,550
And here's your $20.

479
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,080
Next.
