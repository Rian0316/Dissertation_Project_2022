1
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,610
And now the kung pao chicken.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,650
Smooth.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,150
And finally,

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,440
my moo shu pork.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,460
Whoo-hoo!

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,980
Oh, there you have it, gentlemen.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,280
Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.

9
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,800
And it only took 28 minutes.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,730
Impressive, but we must be cautious.

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,700
- Why?  - Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,820
Tomorrow, it travels back in time

13
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,020
and tries to kill Sarah Connor.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,750
I don't think that's going to happen, Sheldon.

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,330
No one ever does.

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,250
That's why it happens.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,770
Hey. Is the food here?

18
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,220
Ooh. What's that?

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,350
That, dear lady,

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,720
is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand,

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,490
designed for extravehicular repairs

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,840
on the International Space Station.

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,330
Ah, cool.

24
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,090
Ask me to pass the soy sauce.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,810
Oh, does that come up much on the space station?

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,080
Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,290
- All right. Pass the soy sauce.  - Coming up.

28
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,140
So how's work?

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,580
Oh, it's not bad.

30
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,700
Kind of hungry.

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,340
Yeah, we all are.

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,160
Just wait.

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,100
You realize, Penny, that the technology

34
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,000
that went into this arm will one day make

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,660
unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete.

36
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:36,910
Really?

37
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,500
They're going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?

38
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,040
I thought you broke up with her.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,590
Why is she here?

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,710
Okay, here we go.

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,240
Passing the soy sauce.

42
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,700
Put out your hand.

43
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,200
That's amazing.

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,060
I wouldn't say amazing.

45
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,980
At best, it's a modest leap forward

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,350

47
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:07,350
from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree.

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,560
Hey, Sheldon?

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,830
Yes?

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,050
Peace?

51
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,460
No, not peace.

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,110
Hang on.

53
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,900
Does NASA know you're using that thing as a napkin holder?

54
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,490
You kidding? They still think it's in a secure locker at JPL.

55
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,490

56
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,010
You stole it?

57
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,110
Borrowed.

58
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,990
The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.

59
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,660
Excuse me.

60
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,000
Amy's at the dry cleaners,

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,600
and she's made a very amusing pun.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,330
"I don't care for perchloroethylene,

63
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,470
and I don't like glycol ether."

64
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,430
Get it?

65
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,830
She doesn't like glycol ether.

66
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,860
Sounds like "either."

67
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,610
"L-O-L."

68
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,080
- Who's Amy?  - His girlfriend.

69
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,220
- Sheldon has a girlfriend?  - She's not my girlfriend.

70
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,050
- How long has this been going on?  - Four months.

71
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,220
She's not my girlfriend.

72
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,680
Are you telling me, for the past four months

73
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,220
I have been asking you, "What's new?"

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,300
and you never thought to go with,

75
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,940
"Sheldon has a girlfriend"?

76
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,470
She's not my girlfriend.

77
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,560
Ah... d-d-d-d...

78
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,010
How did they meet?

79
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,470
Raj and I entered Sheldon's information on a dating site,

80
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,550
and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler.

81
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:04,150
Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy.

82
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,020
Or, as we call them, "Shamy."

83
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,760
Shamy.

84
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,650
I am so digging the Shamy.

85
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,310
All right, everyone pay attention.

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,160
Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler.

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,570
Yes, she is female.

88
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,870
Yes, we communicate on a daily basis,

89
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,580
but no, she is not my girlfriend.

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,340
Okay, well, what do you communicate about?

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,810
Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology,

92
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,820
and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together.

93
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,050
Thank you.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,820
Wait a minute-- a child?

95
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,900
You never see this girl.

96
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,040
You just e-mail and text and Twitter.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,230
Now you're considering having a baby?

98
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,690
Amy pointed out that between the two of us,

99
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,770
our genetic material has the potential

100
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,650
of producing the first in a line

101
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,440
of intellectually superior, benign overlords

102
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,370
to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow.

103
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,340
I'm guessing that future historians

104
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,540
will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.

105
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,800
Okay, I have a question.

106
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,730
Yes, Penny.

107
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,780
You don't even like people touching you.

108
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,610
How are you going to have sex?

109
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,710
Why on earth would we have sex?

110
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,820
Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you?

111
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,230
You know, when your private parts started growing?

112
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,470
I'm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce,

113
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,530
Which is messy, unsanitary,

114
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,690
And based on living next to you for three years,

115
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,250
Involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity.

116
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,900
Oh, God.

117
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,600
Yes, exactly.

118
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,830
Consequently, if Amy and I choose

119
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,470
to bring new life into this world,

120
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,310
It will be accomplished clinically,

121
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,440
with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes.

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,470
Which reminds me--

123
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,500
you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigor.

124
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,450
Is your womb available for rental?

125
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,690
Still digging the Shamy?

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,890
Look, Sheldon,

127
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,970
before you race off to the fertility clinic,

128
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,180
you might want to think about--

129
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,260
uh, gee, I don't know--

130
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,050
maybe actually spending some time with her.

131
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,050
- You mean dating?  - Yeah.

132
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,630
- I can't date Amy.  - Why not?

133
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,600
She's not my girlfriend.

134
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,750
Okay, look, don't think of it as dating a girlfriend.

135
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,070
Think of it as, uh...

136
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,700
Getting to know the future mother of your child.

137
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,030
I hadn't considered that.

138
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,670
I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny.

139
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,250
And you don't think I can achieve

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,480
the required intimacy via text messaging?

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,790
Probably not.

142
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,620
It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.

143
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,190
Penny.

144
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,480
Penny. Penny.

145
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,160
You do realize I stand on the other side of the door

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,980
waiting for you to finish knocking three times.

147
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,590
I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.

148
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,570
Yeah, my point is it's a waste of time.

149
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,880
If you're looking for an example

150
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,590
of a waste of time, I would refer you

151
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,820
to the conversation we're having right now.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,050
What do you want?

153
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,710
I've decided to take your advice and have arranged

154
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,960
to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.

155
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, that's great.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,850
- Have fun.  - Wait.

157
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,730
You have to drive me.

158
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,850
- What?  - You know I don't drive.

159
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,690
- Well, go ask Leonard.  - I did.

160
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,020
He said-- and I quote-- "Ask Penny.

161
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,210
It was her cockamamy idea."

162
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,800
Leonard said "cockamamy"?

163
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,710
Actually, I'm paraphrasing.

164
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,400
Having been raised in a Christian household,

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm uncomfortable with the language he used.

166
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,710
And to be honest,

167
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,390
I'm not entirely comfortable with "cockamamy."

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,510
Okay, fine. When's the date?

169
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,180
- Now.  - Now?

170
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,960
Hurry. We're going to be late.

171
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,780
Sheldon, did it ever occur to you

172
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,970
that I might have other plans?

173
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,150
Do you have other plans?

175
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,190
Well, no, not per se, but...

176
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,230
So this conversation is as pointless

177
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,770
as your door-knocking soliloquy?

178
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,330
Let me get my... cockamamy keys.

179
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,510
Oh, God, that feels so good.

180
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah, that's the spot.

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,680
Oh, baby.

182
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,600
Howard, dinner's ready!

183
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll eat later.

184
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,240
I'm busy!

185
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,140
Oh, yeah.

186
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,180
Just like a real hand.

187
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you for driving me.

188
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,520
You're welcome.

189
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,520
I wish you weren't wearing flip-flops.

190
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,740
It's dangerous to drive in flip-flops.

191
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,350
- Sheldon.  - Sorry.

192
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,560
I just don't want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.

193
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,950
Can I ask you a question?

194
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,850
Given your community college education,

195
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,130
I encourage you to ask me as many as possible.

196
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah. Well, my question is--

197
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,860
and I'm pretty sure I know the answer--

198
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,770
Is this your first date?

199
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,830
That depends.

200
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,910
Does square-dancing with my sister

201
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,550
at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown

202
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,090
count as a date?

203
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,360
No.

204
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,270
Then, this is my first date.

205
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,380
Okay. Well, then, there's a couple of things

206
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,250
you should probably know.

207
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,170
I have a master's degree and two doctorates.

208
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,240
The things I should know, I do know.

209
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,680
My point is, I know more about dating than you,

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,360
and if you were as smart as you think you are,

211
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,990
you would listen to me.

212
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,870
If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight

213
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,080
and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?

214
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,530
Fair point.

215
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,650
You know, there's something I've always wondered about Aquaman.

216
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,020
- Yeah?  - Where does he poop?

217
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,720
What?

218
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,380
What would a toilet look like in Atlantis?

219
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,310
How would you flush it?

220
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,190
And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,680
Hold that thought.

222
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,430
Hey, Howard. What's going on?

223
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,600
What...

224
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,010
Hold on. Howard, Howard, slow down.

225
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,590
The robot hand is stuck on your what?

226
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,340
You're not going to believe this.

227
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,730
So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me

228
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,880
you're a neuro... something-or-other.

229
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,220
Neurobiologist.

230
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,660
Your "check engine" light is on.

231
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,890
Yeah, it's okay.

232
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:14,900
But the light indicates...

233
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,260
Don't bother.

234
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,940
I've wasted many an hour

235
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,610
tilting at that particular windmill.

236
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,590
Uh, what is that scent you're wearing?

237
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,080
It smells great.

238
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,070
Dandruff shampoo.

239
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,840
I have dry scalp.

240
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,800
Well, your hair looks very nice.

241
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,340
Are you a homosexual?

242
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,330
No, no, I'm just giving you a compliment.

243
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,880
Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.

244
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,670
Guys, how 'bout some music?

245
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,840
Oh, no, I wouldn't care for that.

246
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,480
Amy?

247
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,220
No, thank you.

248
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,510
Okay.

249
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,100
Uncomfortable silence it is.

250
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,290
Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy

251
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,090
what it was like for you growing up in Texas?

252
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,440
No.

253
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,760
Well, why don't you tell her?

254
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,580
All right.

255
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:17,700
It was hell.

256
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,550
Any follow up, Amy?

257
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,220
No.

258
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,630
I myself grew up in Nebraska.

259
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,410
Small town outside of Omaha.

260
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:37,560
Nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs.

261
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,290
I'm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?

262
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,310
I don't know. I was just trying something.

263
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,740
Muggles.

264
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,960
You slipped and fell into a robot hand?

265
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,300
Yes.

266
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,040
Penis first?

267
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,240
Yes. Now, help me!

268
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,830
I'd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling

269
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,920
you fell on some of that as well.

270
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,630
Not funny, Leonard.

271
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,520
Really? A robot hand's got a death grip on your junk, dude.

272
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,410
That's funny, ask anyone.

273
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,080
Plea-- before my mother walks in, get this off me!

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,120
Okay, let's see.

275
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,010
No, no! Don't touch.

276
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,070
The program is paused.

277
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,400
Well, then let's un-pause it.

278
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,670
No, no! I loaded the wrong program.

279
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,580
The hand thinks it's holding a screwdriver in outer space.

280
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,270
If you continue the program, it's gonna start twisting.

281
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,880
A-All right.

282
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,530
Um, how about this.

283
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,480
When-when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck

284
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,500
in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him

285
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,170
and pulled and pulled.

286
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,450
You do what you want,

287
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,090
I'm not touching another man's honey tree.

288
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,550
All right, uh, forget pulling.

289
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,190
How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?

290
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,990
What?! No saws!

291
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,140
One circumcision was enough.

292
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,650
How about an acetylene torch?

293
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,420
Okay, I can't believe this needs to be said out loud.

294
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,810
No pulling, no saws, no torches.

295
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,420
Well, then what do you want us to do?

296
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,820
Howard, I made cookies for you

297
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,280
and your little friends!

298
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,750
That's great, Mom, thanks!

299
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,580
I'll bring them up with some Hawaiian Punch!

300
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,960
Don't come up here!

301
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,190
Why not?! Are you ashamed of your mother?!

302
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,590
Yes, but that's not the point!

303
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,710
Get me out of here.

304
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,860
You have any ideas, Raj?

305
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,790
Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch.

306
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Hey, here's another possible topic of conversation.

307
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,310
This is a big night for Sheldon.

308
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,480
Right, Sheldon?

309
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,090
Big night?

310
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,530
The winter solstice is a big night.

311
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,210
It's over 14 hours

312
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,180
in Southern California.

313
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,440
That's an amusing factoid.

314
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,290
Thank you.

315
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,520
No, no.

316
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,230
My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldon's first official date.

317
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,900
Discuss.

318
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,310
Is this true?

319
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,420
Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus

320
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,240
Fourth of July Hoedown didn't count.

321
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,260
So, um, Amy, what about you?

322
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,190
Do you date much?

323
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,470
Once a year.

324
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,520
It's a deal I made with my mother

325
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,640
in exchange for her silence on the matter,

326
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,680
as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill

327
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,530
that seals in the flavor without the fat.

328
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:39,890
How about you, Penny?

329
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,400
Do you go on many dates?

330
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't say many.

331
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,510
A few.

332
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,190
What's...?

333
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,970
Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as "A few."

334
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,420
What...

335
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,520
Where did you get 171 men?

336
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,140
Simple extrapolation.

337
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,980
In the three years that I've known you,

338
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,440
you were single for two.

339
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,400
During that time, I saw 17 different suitors.

340
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,700
If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias

341
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,230
and postulate an initial dating age of 15

342
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,030
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,720
I did not start dating at 15.

344
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,870
I'm sorry. Sixteen?

345
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,550
Fourteen.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,930
My mistake.

347
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,610
Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present,

348
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,910
that would bring the total up to 193 men.

349
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,040
Plus or minus eight men.

350
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,530
Remarkable.

351
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,250
Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?

352
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,170
No.

353
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,090
Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.

354
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,590
Based on the number of awkward encounters I've had

355
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:46,030
with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning,

356
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,280
plus the number of times she's returned home wearing the same clothes

357
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
she wore the night before...

358
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,140
Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.

359
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,740
So we multiply 193--

360
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,480
minus 21 men before the loss of virginity--

361
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,650
so 172 times 0.18 gives us...

362
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,380
30.96 sexual partners.

363
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,510
Let's round that up to 31.

364
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

365
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,750
That is not even close to the real number.

366
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,710
I'm gonna need a drink over here.

367
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:16,890
This is very interesting.

368
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,490
Cultural perceptions are subjective.

369
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,200
Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?

370
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,430
No! No!

371
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,740
No.

372
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,680
Let's just all finish our dinners, okay?

373
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,730
This is an interesting topic.

374
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,290
How many sexual encounters have you had?

375
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,420
Does volunteering for a scientific experiment

376
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,330
in which orgasm was achieved by electronically

377
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,960
stimulating the pleasure centers of the brain count?

378
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,160
I should think so.

379
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,240
Then 128.

380
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,780
Okay, come on.

381
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,270
Almost there.

382
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,760
- Don't tug. - No tugging.

383
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,940
Next time, take your own advice.

384
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,170
Excuse me, could you help us out?

385
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,090
My, my, my.

386
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,240
What do we have here?

387
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,020
I slipped and fell.

388
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
Yeah, we get that a lot.

389
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,660
What is this?

390
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,180
It's a robot arm.

391
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,330
Where's the rest of the robot?

392
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,510
I only built the arm.

393
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,660
'Cause that's all you needed, right?

394
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,470
Can you please just help me?!

395
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,350
All right, all right.

396
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,200
Hang on, stay calm.

397
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,880
I need an orderly with a wheelchair.

398
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,710
I got a robot hand grasping a man's penis out here.

399
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,030
You think you could be a little more discreet?

400
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm sorry,we don't have a code for "Robot hand grasping a man's penis."

401
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,860
Why is it hooked up to a computer?

402
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,600
- Uh, it's what controls the arm. - But it's frozen.

403
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,070
Did you try turning it off and back on again?

404
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,050
No, you see, it's more complicated than that.

405
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,380
No, wait!

406
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,570
Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree.

407
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,210
Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?

408
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,500
You were right.

409
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,140
This was a very productive evening.

410
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:35,830
I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.

411
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,970
I did not have sex with 31 guys.

412
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,840
I'll be happy to check the math, but numbers don't lie, Penny.

413
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,720
In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together,

414
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,980
I feel much more confident

415
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,830
proceeding to the next stage of our relationship.

416
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,970
And that is?

417
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,050
Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus

418
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,860
to gift humanity with our progeny.

419
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,640
You're still on that?

420
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,370
In these uncertain times, doesn't humanity deserve a gift?

421
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,830
Okay, you know what?

422
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,340
I'm gonna come at this in a whole new way.

423
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,220
Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish,

424
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,310
I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

425
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,550
That's no threat.

426
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,560
My mother's always wanted a grandchild.

427
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,750
Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother

428
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,660
wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?

429
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,830
Curses.

430
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,680
If I'd thought of that in the first place,

431
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,020
I could've saved myself this whole night.

432
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,810
Well, it's not that late.

433
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,400
You could still go out and look for number 32.

434
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,020
Good night.

435
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,400
Hey, Howard, what's up?

436
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,040
I've decided not to procreate.

437
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,530
Yeah, yeah, great.

438
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,380
Howard, uh, slow down.

439
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,120
What do you mean it happened again?
