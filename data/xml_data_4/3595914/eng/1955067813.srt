1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,996
MORRlS: Mrs Owen's
expecting a lot of guests.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,598
And she chose you.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,073
Welcome to Soldier lsland.

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,319
VERA: Mr Lombard, you seem
to be underthe impression

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,998
that I am a particular
kind of woman.

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,951
And I assure you that I am not.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,117
They're the ten little soldiers.
You know, from the poem.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,549
ACTOR: Ladies and gentlemen.
- Who is that?

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,398
You are charged with
the following indictments:

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,069
Philip Lombard,
that you did murder 21 men.

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,951
What the hell
are they playing at?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,558
Malicious nonsense!

13
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,160
Cyril... I really tried
to save him.

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,758
I almost drowned.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,199
21 men.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,357
I'm the only one telling the
truth in a room full of liars.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,799
- (Knocking)
- Who is it?

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,875
(Choking)

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,911
MACARTHUR: We are cut off.

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,152
Rats in a barrel.

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,035
- Almonds.
- Almonds be buggered.

22
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,118
Cyanide.

23
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,271
None of you moved them?

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,117
- No.
- No.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,472
Was it you, Doctor?

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,593
No.

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,431
How did Mrs Rogers die?

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,799
I have no idea.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,637
Did you give her something?

30
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,557
Yes, a mild sedative.

31
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,319
- Did you give hertoo much?
- Miss Claythorne...

32
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,715
I warned you against
becoming hysterical.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,352
It's the poem.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,391
It's the poem, don't you see?

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,351
Ten little soldiers boys -

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,630
one choked himself,
one overslept himself,

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,113
and then there were eight.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,197
There were ten ofthese and
ten of us and nowthere's eight.

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,309
(Door opens)

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,593
Oh, General? General?
Did you move the figures?

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,755
What?

42
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,552
The figures,
did you move the figures?

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,192
No, of course not.

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,152
Perhaps it was you, Miss
Claythorne. You discovered it.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,589
Of course it wasn't me.
Why would I do that?

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,835
To be the centre of attention.
Do you crave it?

47
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,758
- Any kind of attention?
- What are you talking about?

48
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,199
Shall we just have breakfast?

49
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,955
- Mm.
- Mm.

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,439
(Emily clears her throat)

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,550
It was dreadful news,
about Mrs Rogers.

52
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,033
(Clears her throat)

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,752
She was a wonderful cook.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,438
Such a shame.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,832
This egg is four minutes
precisely, is it?

56
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,277
Yes, madam.

57
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,517
Rogers...did you take away
two ofthese figures?

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,799
- No, miss.
- (Sighs)

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,037
Condolences, Mr Rogers. When
are you expecting Narracott?

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,593
Mid to late morning, sir.

61
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,710
His timekeeping
is somewhat erratic.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,879
Will that be all?

63
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,434
Yes, thank you, Rogers.
Thank you very much.

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,998
VERA: Tony Marston
was young and strong.

65
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,031
He didn't die
from some stimulant.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,358
Perhaps he was poisoned.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,392
And Mrs Rogers,
perhaps she was given too much.

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,553
What drugs do you have
in your medical bag, Doctor?

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,591
Why did you even bring it?

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,676
You're a guest. It's not work.

71
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,711
Actually, it is work.

72
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,639
I was trying to maintain some
sort of professional discretion.

73
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,908
However...

74
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,638
Mrs Owen suffers
from female neuroses.

75
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,274
My speciality is
women's disorders.

76
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,954
Mr Owen engaged me
in a professional capacity

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,479
to tend to his wife!

78
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,590
Gave up on the surgery,
then, Doctor?

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,791
People do not just die
out of nowhere for no reason.

80
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,752
They die because something
was done to them by someone.

81
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,155
- I'm going to check your bag.
- Don't you dare!

82
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,555
- What have you got to hide?
BLORE: How about I do it?

83
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,469
I'm not being searched
like some grubby criminal!

84
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,556
EMlLY: What ifthe General
goes with him?

85
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,959
He's an honourable man.

86
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,631
Fine! But while you're at it,
you might want to search...

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,671
Judge Wargrave's case as well.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,631
I knowwhere
I've seen you before.

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,238
Chap who has the clinic
beneath mine in Harley Street.

90
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,635
He's a cancer specialist.
That's where I saw you.

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,717
If anyone has strong painkillers
and sedatives in his case,

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,159
it's Judge Wargrave.

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,271
Is that true, Judge?

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,349
I have had health problems, yes.

95
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,791
Then that's very cruel, Doctor.

96
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,717
Don't blame me. You pushed it.

97
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,751
General, shall we?

98
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,678
(Ticking)

99
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,473
Just mild sedatives.

100
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,158
ARMSTRONG: As I said.

101
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,191
Bog standard.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,753
Nothing special.

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,791
My surgery was a success.

104
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,671
This - the house, the island -

105
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,359
is meant to be my recuperation.

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,834
Sea air, peace...

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,554
..and rest.

108
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,349
- Very sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Hm.

109
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,874
- Well, there's an end to it.
- Like hell it is!

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,036
Why shouldn't she be searched?

111
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,509
Equal rights forwomen, hm?

112
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,357
Let's see what you've got.

113
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,029
WARGRAVE: Dr Armstrong,
control yourself, please.

114
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,631
Who the hell
do you think you are?

115
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,791
I'm a doctor,
you're a secretary.

116
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,198
Somebody moved them.

117
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,192
They did!

118
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,231
Someone did that.

119
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,751
(Door opens)

120
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,271
Did you really kill
all those men?

121
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,157
Yes, Miss Claythorne,
I did kill all those men.

122
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,999
And more.

123
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,159
Why?

124
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,589
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

125
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,710
They had something I wanted.
In this case, it was diamonds.

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,151
Worth more than a few lives.

127
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,951
What about you?

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,792
What did you want?

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,791
I nearly drowned.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,955
I failed to save
a little boy in my care.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,195
And there isn't one minute
of every day

132
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,231
that I am not sorry for that.

133
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,238
Why aren't you?

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,271
I know what I am.

135
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,675
I always knew it would
catch up with me.

136
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,231
And here it is.

137
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,677
(lnhales deeply)

138
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,231
(Shells exploding overhead)

139
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,949
WOMAN: I love you,
I love you, I love you.

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,989
I think about you and you
kissing me and your hands

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,792
on me and in me
and your mouth on my body

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,354
and I cannot bear
that you are not with me now.

143
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,036
I wish...I long...
I crave for you, my darling.

144
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,719
And I feel so cruel
to poor dear John.

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,514
But the sun rises
and sets in your eyes, Henry.

146
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,949
I love you. I love you.

147
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,832
I am yours.

148
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,115
The men are all ready
for the whistle, sir.

149
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,151
Morale fairly good.

150
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,231
(Shells explode overhead)

151
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,631
Here, er...Iet me.

152
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,192
Henry.

153
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,831
You've been a...
a great friend to my wife and l.

154
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,391
(Exhales)

155
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,431
Perhaps you could call me John.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,757
(Shells explode overhead)

157
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,671
Thank you...John.

158
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,111
(Gasps)

159
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,799
(Exhales heavily)

160
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,876
Myself and Mrs Rogers
were here for a week

161
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,435
without seeing a soul apart from
Narracott with the deliveries.

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,869
Lombard.

163
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,639
Where are you going?

164
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,195
We're sat around waiting
for Ulick Norman Owen.

165
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,276
What if he's been here
all along?

166
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,831
Plenty of places
he could be hiding.

167
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,073
Wait for me.

168
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,751
(Breathes erratically)

169
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,711
Please, please, please...

170
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,637
just fucking stop.

171
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,796
Stop, stop, stop.

172
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,238
Stop, stop.

173
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,229
Now, this is... This is barmy!

174
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,711
No-one could hide down there.

175
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,751
(Gulls cry)

176
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,839
Ever get the feeling
you're being hunted, Tubs?

177
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,916
Stop calling me that.
I ain't even fat.

178
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,556
And, no, I don't.

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,715
Really?

180
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,111
Cos Mr Owen...

181
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,675
whoever he may be...
knows a lot about us.

182
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,472
Well, not about me.

183
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,193
Edward Landorwas a degenerate,
he was a pansy.

184
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,950
He fell down the steps
into his cell.

185
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,711
You never touched him?

186
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,112
I wouldn't want to be near
one ofthem dirty bastards.

187
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,471
Come on, Tubs, keep up!

188
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,958
(Gulls cry)

189
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,079
General?

190
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,111
Is your suitcase ready?

191
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,877
She died...

192
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,833
..of Spanish influenza
afterthe war.

193
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,909
Who?

194
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,551
My wife Leslie.

195
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,158
After all that...

196
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,191
she died ofthe Spanish flu.

197
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,878
So many did.

198
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,434
I should have just stepped aside
like a gentleman

199
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,517
and...just let them be happy.

200
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,991
Do come back to the house,
General.

201
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,997
You haven't brought
your case down yet

202
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,112
and we want to get away
as soon as Mr Narracott arrives.

203
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,195
He's not coming, Narracott,
you know.

204
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,951
No-one's coming for us.

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,276
We won't be leaving the island.
This is the end.

206
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,034
It's a reliefto come to the
end, to knowthat it's over.

207
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,708
You won't understand that yet
but you will, in time.

208
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,071
I think you're quite mistaken.

209
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,398
The boat will come and
we'll all be waiting for you.

210
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,959
(Exhales)

211
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,031
(Gulls crying)

212
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,193
(Shells booming)

213
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,952
(Voices whispering)

214
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,751
(Shellfire intensifies)

215
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,111
(Bombs exploding)

216
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,151
(Gunfire and bullets whistling)

217
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,512
Ah, Miss Claythorne.

218
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,471
Good.

219
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,590
Bring a couple of chairs,
would you?

220
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,678
(Chairs scraping)

221
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,276
What's going on?

222
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,197
It's a bit early
to be on the sauce.

223
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,752
It's been something
of a morning.

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,951
Hey, hey. Ssh.

225
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,075
Bastard's down there.
I heard him.

226
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,833
What bastard?

227
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,229
Owen.

228
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,589
LOMBARD:
I can hear him moving about.

229
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,119
Marston's room.

230
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,957
(Clattering)

231
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,037
(Rogers breathes heavily)

232
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,071
What are you doing?

233
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,953
Camp bed.

234
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,150
Well, we had to find somewhere
to store it.

235
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,271
Young men don't look under beds.

236
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,753
ARMSTRONG: Why do you need a
camp bed? What are you planning?

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,472
I can't sleep in my room, can l?

238
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,112
My wife.

239
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,912
No, obviously. Of course.

240
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,711
I've got to find
somewhere else to set up.

241
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,751
What for? We're all leaving!

242
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,791
Well, you might be.
This is my job.

243
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,832
I can't go anywhere until
my employer dismisses me.

244
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,189
Your employer?
Your employer is insane!

245
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,912
Be that as it may,

246
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,951
I've got nothing else to go to.

247
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,111
All right, then,
carry on, Rogers.

248
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,951
Did you know he had a gun?

249
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,999
No.

250
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,639
Do stop.

251
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,877
Mr Narracott seems a sensible
man. He'll be here.

252
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,479
I must say, I understand now

253
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,512
why you teach in such
a sub-standard establishment.

254
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,469
I'm just observing
that most schools

255
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,239
would not want to be associated
with an inquest.

256
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,352
I'm not accusing you. There's
been enough ofthat already.

257
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,789
Yes, there has.
More than enough.

258
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,751
Apart from the egregious
Mr Lombard

259
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,110
and the Rogers,
who I find most dubious,

260
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,631
and the depraved Mr Marston,
it's all nonsense.

261
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,435
Everyone was simply
doing their duty.

262
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,073
As was l.

263
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,479
As were you?

264
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,590
You didn't say anything
last night.

265
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,075
It wasn't for gentlemen's ears.

266
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,998
Beatrice Taylorwas
my maid of all work.

267
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,597
Foundling girl...

268
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,312
an unwanted.

269
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,715
From the war, you know.

270
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,556
I believed herto be a clean,
decent, modest girl.

271
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,952
I taught her needlework skills.

272
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,991
We had quite the little home.

273
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,310
But then she got herself
into trouble.

274
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,991
The family way.

275
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,955
As her own loose mother
had with her.

276
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,271
She begged me for help.

277
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,919
Naturally, and quite properly,
I refused.

278
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,751
(Beatrice sobs)

279
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,271
Miss Brent, please!

280
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,592
I beg you!

281
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,272
What happened to her?

282
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,992
She threw herself under a train.

283
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,837
She killed herself?

284
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,757
Even made the local paper.

285
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,950
And they turned it into some
pot-boiling, sentimental tale.

286
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,793
She asked you for help.
If you had helped her...

287
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,478
It was the weakness
in her character

288
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,351
which drove her actions.

289
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,072
Why should I be reproached?

290
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,397
Ask Rogers for some tea.

291
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,791
Lemon, not milk.

292
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,270
ARMSTRONG: It's a wild goose
chase, ifyou ask me.

293
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,393
A grown man, hiding and
sneaking about. It's ridiculous.

294
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,431
Marston was given cyanide,
though.

295
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,439
Wasn't he, Tubs?

296
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,879
Cyanide?

297
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,911
I'm pretty sure of it.

298
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,912
I don't know. You were convinced
of it this morning.

299
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,912
Claythorne forthe cyanide.
I'd put money on it.

300
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,713
- She don't seem the type.
- She's exactly the type.

301
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,274
What about the old boy,
the General?

302
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,436
Dangerous men come back
from overthere,

303
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,277
their noggins all scrambled.

304
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,072
Let's search everybody, then.

305
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,192
God-bothering Miss Brent,
let's search Wargrave...

306
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,753
- The Judge?
- Mm.

307
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,951
Well-known as a hanging judge.
Infamous forthe black square.

308
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,470
The story goes that he'd watch
every execution he'd ordered.

309
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,910
Tubs, you've looked sideways
at Armstrong all morning

310
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,951
and now everyone's fair game.

311
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,111
- You suggested the Judge.
- I was taking the piss.

312
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,151
Mr Owen is on the island.

313
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,191
And I'm going to find him.

314
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,189
You don't want to pay attention
to what he said.

315
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,151
He's just stirring the shit pot.

316
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,191
And I can stir it right back.

317
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,951
(Wind rumbling)

318
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,551
(Gulls cry)

319
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,151
(Gulls continue to cry)

320
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,197
(Thunder rumbles)

321
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,229
Oh.

322
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,871
(Men grunting)

323
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,878
LOMBARD: Don't look.

324
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,797
Someone did this?

325
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,149
BLORE: Well, it weren't
no bleeding accident.

326
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,197
It's murder.

327
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,751
He said no-one
was coming for us.

328
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,831
He said this was the end.

329
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,151
Miss Claythorne?

330
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,389
"Eight little soldier boys
travelling in Devon.

331
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,238
One said he'd stay there
and then there were seven."

332
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,751
Count them, Judge.

333
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,791
Count them.

334
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,831
(Thunder crashes)

335
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,757
(Wind howling)

336
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,592
VERA: Cyril!

337
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,719
Run!

338
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,115
Find help, a boat!

339
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,399
Run!

340
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,232
Cyril!

341
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,871
(Cry echoes) Cyril!

342
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,112
Miss Claythorne!

343
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,238
I just want to go!

344
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,759
You'll drown!

345
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,958
Please!

346
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,557
Please!

347
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,989
Come inside. Come, come.

348
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,470
I've got you.
Don't worry, it's all right.

349
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,749
LOMBARD: I told you
Owen was on the island.

350
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,791
What made you so sure?

351
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,115
- lnstinct.
- We've got to be rational.

352
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,358
Stick with procedure.

353
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,992
Who is this Owen?

354
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,519
And Mrs Owen.

355
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,596
I don't think there
even is a Mrs Owen.

356
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,915
BLORE: We must all have
something in common.

357
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,679
- Someone who knows us all.
EMlLY: How can that be possible?

358
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,632
I can imagine crossing paths
with a doctor,

359
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,477
a judge, but...

360
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,511
someone like Mr Lombard?

361
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,438
Well, we've crossed paths now,
haven't we?

362
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,037
Mr Lombard, Blore tells me
that you have a revolver.

363
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,188
Oh, Tubs.

364
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,435
- Why have you got a gun?
- He's got a gun?

365
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,879
I carry it everywhere.

366
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,673
And it was implied
that I might need it.

367
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,591
Implied? By whom?

368
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,354
My client needs a good man
who can handle situations.

369
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,155
- Who's your client?
- Mr Owen.

370
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,156
Ulick Norman Owen.

371
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,997
Never heard of him.

372
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,837
But he has heard of you.

373
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,871
Audrey, the box.

374
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,118
It's dangerous, then?

375
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,038
My client believes
that it could become volatile.

376
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,759
I see.

377
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,555
And howwould Mr Owen
wish me to proceed?

378
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,196
He leaves that
to your discretion.

379
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,710
- But forewarned is...
- Is forearmed.

380
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,352
I understand.

381
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,391
That's who got in touch with me
about the job with Mrs Owen.

382
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,351
Isaac Morris in Soho.

383
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,630
Soho? Hm.

384
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,480
WARGRAVE: I was invited here
by the Owens,

385
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,239
whom I'd never heard of,
to join a mutual friend,

386
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,316
Mrs Culmington.

387
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,193
The perfect place
to recover, it said.

388
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,800
The envelope was postmarked
London, Soho.

389
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,988
A sink of depravity.

390
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,600
A godless desert of vice.

391
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,473
What brings you here,
Miss Brent?

392
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,511
Mrs Owen wrote to me.

393
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,993
She was interested in my work.

394
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,193
The Moral Education of Girls
ofthe lower orders.

395
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,151
They have to be taught
modesty and decency

396
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,637
or society will be drowned in a
rising tide of unwanted babies,

397
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,796
all squalling to be fed.

398
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,195
She wanted to contribute
to my cause.

399
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,316
Blore?

400
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,716
I got a letter...
from Ulick Norman Owen.

401
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,838
He was impressed
by my standing in the force.

402
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,996
He said if I could
see my way clear

403
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,474
to spending some time
keeping an eye out

404
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,715
that he would recompense me
generously.

405
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,318
Keeping an eye out forwhat?

406
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,878
He said that someone was here
underfalse pretences.

407
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,753
He also supplied
a list of guests.

408
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,236
All ofyou - every one ofyou.

409
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,670
What he didn't say was
that Lombard would have a gun.

410
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,468
ARMSTRONG: Is it Mr Owen's voice
on the record?

411
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,273
- Does anybody recognise it?
- Are we forgetting the gun?

412
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,197
There's a Fenian there
with a bloody gun!

413
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,435
- Don't blaspheme.
BLORE: Hand it over.

414
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,357
Surrender yourweapon,
Mr Lombard.

415
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,550
- Not a chance.
- I could make you.

416
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,636
You can try.

417
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,955
Wait. Is lsaac Morris Mr Owen?

418
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,633
No. I'd have found that
sweaty bucket of lard by now.

419
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,159
EMlLY: Jews.

420
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,918
Whereverthere's a problem,

421
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,632
there's Jews
at the bottom of it.

422
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,920
- Something struck me.
- (Thunder rumbles)

423
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,952
I can't think
why I didn't see it before.

424
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,075
Ulick Norman Owen.

425
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,429
Una Nancy Owen.

426
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,672
Or...

427
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,631
WARGRAVE: U.N. OWEN...

428
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,511
..is unknown.

429
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,028
(Thunder rumbles)

430
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,310
It's a riddle, perhaps.

431
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,952
What does it mean?

432
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,037
It means that Mr Lombard
is right to insist

433
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,230
that the killer
is on the island.

434
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,158
And he's getting very wet
out there.

435
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,316
The killer's not out there.

436
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,998
The killer is in here.

437
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,755
It is one of us.

438
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,113
We've never met each other
before now. Why?

439
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,038
How could I possibly be capable?

440
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,548
Oh, anyone is capable,
Miss Brent.

441
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,592
40 years on the criminal benches
taught me that.

442
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,073
Rogers.

443
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,839
Oh, here we go again,
lining up the next suspect.

444
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,075
You mark my words - Rogers.

445
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,714
He's an oily bugger.
Slinking around.

446
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,558
EMlLY: Going back and forth
during dinner.

447
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,034
He could have put something
in Mr Marston's drink.

448
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,991
I heard him tell Mrs Rogers
to shut up.

449
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,190
Well, she's shut up now,
isn't she?

450
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,310
He's the one moving the figures.

451
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,638
But the General, the rest of us,
that record, this house. Why?

452
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,000
Rogers - he's got low cunning
running through him

453
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,837
Iike Brighton
through a stick of rock.

454
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,156
- We need to watch him.
- Any faith I ever had

455
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,954
in the Thin Blue Line evaporated
the second I met you, Tubs.

456
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,434
You call me that one more time,
mate, one more time...

457
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,471
And you'll what?

458
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,795
(Wind howling outside)

459
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,593
We are all being hunted.

460
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,870
There's someone else
on this island.

461
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,917
And when I find him,
I'm going to make him number 22,

462
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,518
with a bullet right there.

463
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,358
- Oh, God.
- How could you say that...

464
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,833
so easily?

465
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,678
I just open my mouth
and it comes out.

466
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,195
(Door creaks open)

467
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,875
I'll see what can be done
about supper.

468
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,514
There's some liver and kidneys.

469
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,438
Perhaps a pie...
with some good gravy.

470
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,709
That would be delicious, Rogers.
Thank you.

471
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,796
Thank you, Rogers.

472
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,312
Well, I ain't eating a mouthful
of his pie.

473
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,351
(Sniffs)

474
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,474
(Thunder)

475
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,912
(Wind whistling)

476
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,038
Oh, well, good night.

477
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,071
(Thunder cracks)

478
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,871
Trust in God.

479
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,790
But perhaps also...

480
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,434
we should lock our doors.

481
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,832
(Electricity fizzes)

482
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,950
(Muffled praying)

483
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,555
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

484
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,397
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

485
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,232
(Thunder cracks)

486
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,271
(Door blows open and wind howls)

487
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,511
(Male voice recites poem)

488
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,751
(Crack of thunder)

489
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,550
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness

490
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,750
for His name's sake.

491
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,313
Yea, though I walk through...

492
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,874
BEATRlCE:..the valley
ofthe shadow of death,

493
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,514
I will fear no evil...

494
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,596
forthou art with me.

495
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,276
..I will fear no evil.

496
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,073
I will fear no evil
forthou art...

497
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,315
I will fear no evil
forthou art with me.

498
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,231
(Thunder crashes)

499
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,153
Get up! Get up!

500
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,231
Get up!

501
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,877
Get up!

502
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,478
(Gong resonating)

503
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,154
- I was looking for him.
- (She vomits)

504
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,795
I wanted a coffee.
I looked...and I found this.

505
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,271
It wasn't me.
I just wanted a damn coffee.

506
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,392
- It wasn't me.
- He's been here all night.

507
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,398
"Seven little soldiers
chopping up sticks,

508
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,398
one chopped himself in half
and then there were six."

509
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,750
So she's right.

510
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,630
It is the poem.

511
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,318
But he's fucked,
Mr Unknown Owen,

512
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,478
because "Six little soldier boys
played with a hive.

513
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,670
A bumblebee stung one
and then there were five."

514
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,870
And there is no hive here
and there are no bees.

515
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,151
What are you going to do now,
Mr Unknown Owen? You're fucked!

516
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,031
Now get dressed.

517
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,278
We will all get dressed
and I will make coffee.

518
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,275
- Miss Brent, shall we?
- Yes.

519
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,196
Shit. Shit the bed.

520
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,071
We need to wrap him up
or he's going to go everywhere.

521
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,871
(Ticking)

522
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,351
(Approaching footsteps)

523
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,589
Coffee.

524
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,916
There's no milk, I'm afraid.

525
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,076
Does this...person...

526
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,791
..mean to kill us all?

527
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,558
I believe so, yes.

528
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,031
I've lost a ball ofwool.

529
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,959
I'm quite ridiculously
distressed about it.

530
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,234
It's only wool.

531
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,633
(Rumble ofthunder)

532
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,031
(Sighs)

533
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,792
I'm so very tired.

534
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,312
Drink your coffee, Miss Brent.

535
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,150
I'll bring you a candle
to see by.

536
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,191
Thank you, dear.

537
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,111
(Crack ofthunder)

538
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,391
(Rain pattering on windows)

539
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,279
I'll make some more.

540
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,590
Judge Wargrave,
I feel I owe you an apology

541
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,915
for exposing your illness

542
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,837
in such
an unforgiveable fashion.

543
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,757
We're all feeling
a little ragged.

544
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,836
Understandably.

545
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,115
What's your opinion
ofthe others?

546
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,752
I haven't really formed one.

547
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,711
I don't trust any ofthem.

548
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,069
Blore. That bastard Lombard.

549
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,394
Claythorne.

550
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,396
Miss Brent
and her religious mania.

551
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,511
But you and l...

552
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,479
..we have sharp minds.

553
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,348
Actual intellects.

554
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,958
We should stick together.

555
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,393
Mm.

556
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,559
Very well.

557
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,673
Oh...

558
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,433
Here.

559
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,038
Thank you.

560
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,435
Dribbling down myself
like a child.

561
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,430
(Thunder rumbling)

562
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,515
Miss Claythorne's
making the coffee.

563
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,630
She should be watched.

564
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,191
(Grunting)

565
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,238
Right...

566
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,031
You do the stairs.

567
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,640
I'm going to wash the guts
out ofthe wood store.

568
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,951
(Water splashes gently)

569
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,233
(Crockery clinks)

570
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,675
(Door opens in adjoining room)

571
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,871
Can l?

572
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,515
I rather enjoy domestictasks.

573
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,791
They are soothing.

574
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,829
Normal.

575
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,151
Indeed.

576
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,117
I'll just be a moment.

577
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,276
All right.

578
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,231
(Rain pattering on window)

579
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,351
(Hinges squeak)

580
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,510
(Gong resonating)

581
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,910
VERA: Stung by a bee.

582
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,118
- And then there were five.
- (Crack ofthunder)

583
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,396
Well, I suppose, with no Rogers,
I should think about lunch.

584
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,795
I could eat a scabby horse.

585
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,550
You're actually hungry?

586
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,590
It was heavy work...
dealing with Rogers.

587
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,835
And you're the one
who suggested lunch.

588
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,553
Only because it's what one does
at this time of day.

589
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,636
But I'm not hungry.
How could you be hungry?

590
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,636
Oi, you.

591
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,671
Don't go implying...

592
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,037
..casting aspersions. I've got
nothing to do with this.

593
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,752
I've got nothing to do
with any of it.

594
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,631
Just because I said
I was hungry... I am.

595
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,398
It doesn't prove a single thing.

596
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,951
I'm going to get dressed.

597
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,519
The whole morning,

598
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,676
dragging Rogers around,
clearing up guts,

599
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,188
without so much as a cup oftea
to wet my whistle,

600
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:50,437
- and you look at me like a...
- Calm down.

601
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,310
You've got some front, love.

602
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,389
You got some right brass neck.

603
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,358
LOMBARD: Don't go downstairs
on your own.

604
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,992
Not with those two.

605
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,594
- What, Wargrave and Armstrong?
- Mm-hm.

606
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,357
You wait up here for me.

607
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,958
LOMBARD:
It was locked,

608
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,468
which means there must be
a master key.

609
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,112
Rogers must have had
a master key.

610
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,515
- You two dealt with the body.
- And you found it.

611
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,794
Or did you?

612
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,355
You shrieking like a woman...was
that a bit of amateur dramatics?

613
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,072
I did nothing to Rogers.

614
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,351
I didn't take any master key. We
don't even know ifthere is one.

615
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,675
And we only have yourword
that the gun was stolen.

616
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,029
- You could've taken it.
- Why steal my own gun?

617
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,389
I don't knowwhy you'd do
anything, Lombard.

618
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,396
I don't knowwhy
you killed Rogers

619
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,908
- or Miss Brent or MacArthur.
- I didn't kill them.

620
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,678
You would say that,
wouldn't you?

621
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,393
Just like you'd say
that your gun was stolen.

622
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,512
You really are a first-class...

623
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:15,792
five-star, solid gold
fucking moron.

624
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,671
WARGRAVE: Please.
The lady. Hm?

625
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,836
BLORE: Double bluff.

626
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,832
What, Tubs?

627
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,872
Why you would steal your own
gun. Armstrong's got a point.

628
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,356
It's all riddles and games,
smoke and mirrors. Double bluff.

629
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,598
You were the last one down.

630
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,239
The last one.

631
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,357
Ages behind everyone else.
What took you so long?

632
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,596
- I don't care to say.
LOMBARD: You killed Rogers.

633
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,515
You took the master key.
You went to bed.

634
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,790
You made sure all of us
were downstairs,

635
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,353
got into my room
and took my gun.

636
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,958
You have my gun,
you little prick.

637
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,036
- For heaven's sake.
- I never killed Rogers

638
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,435
and I ain't got your key
or your sodding gun.

639
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,472
Then what took you so long?
If you weren't stealing my gun,

640
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,033
then why were you the last down?

641
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,958
I was in the bloody lavvy
if you must know.

642
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,752
Constipated!

643
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,391
(Laughter)

644
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,994
Oh, yes. Laugh it up.

645
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,798
It's not funny.

646
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,831
I was bound up something rotten.

647
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,029
(Laughter)

648
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,833
Sat there in a muck sweat.

649
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,270
So it weren't me.
It could have been any of us.

650
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,114
Any one of us
could have had the key.

651
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,559
Any one of us
could have the gun.

652
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,236
(Clock ticking)

653
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,157
It is the only way to be sure.

654
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,714
BLORE: It's not like
you've been singled out.

655
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,910
We're all getting the same.

656
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,508
BLORE: No key. No gun.

657
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,951
Well...now you, Miss Claythorne.

658
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,551
Of course.

659
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,912
I'm just being thorough.

660
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,035
You like Uncle Hugo, don't you?

661
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,672
VERA: I do.

662
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,029
I'm in love with him.

663
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,116
I love him so much it hurts.

664
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,754
Silly. Girls are silly.

665
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,153
(Chuckles)

666
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,191
And I'm going to marry him.

667
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,993
I heard Mummy say he couldn't
afford to get married.

668
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,631
Well, I'll find a way, Cyril.

669
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,513
- lfyou marry Uncle Hugo...
- When I marry Hugo.

670
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,790
-..will you be my aunt?
- I will.

671
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,831
Aunt Vera.

672
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,359
And what fun we'll have.

673
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,756
Christmas and birthdays
and summer holidays.

674
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,678
Picnics, parties, pony rides.

675
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,839
How happy we'll be
when we have everything.

676
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,151
(Rain pattering on windows)

677
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,790
(Muffled shouting)

678
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,230
(Muffled scream)

679
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,071
(She gasps)

680
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,713
ARMSTRONG:
Why isn't Lombard doing this?

681
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,990
Blore and I thought it a good
idea to keep you two apart.

682
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,714
Well, well, Miss Claythorne.

683
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,997
Mr Lombard.

684
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,395
Philip.

685
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,758
Vera.

686
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,990
(Door opens nearby)

687
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,912
Nothing.

688
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,838
We'll search the rest of
the house. Every room.

689
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,791
(Cutlery rattling)

690
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,031
(Clattering)

691
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,911
(Thunder)

692
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,551
(Clock ticking)

693
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,554
(Clock chiming)

694
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,077
BLORE: We're in hell...

695
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,680
and we're being punished
forwhat we done.

696
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:55,917
WARGRAVE: He refused the hood.
He haunts me still.

697
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,191
Look at them. There's something
going on between them.

698
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,317
VERA: And someone has to come
for us soon. They have to.

699
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,669
BLORE: I reckon
we're being watched.

700
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,279
- (Yells)
- We are.
