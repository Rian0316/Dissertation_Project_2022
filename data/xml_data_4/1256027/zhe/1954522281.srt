and plus however long tak to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

store seems a little redundant now.
看来作弄苹果店里的人都多余

Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

have modern plumbing.

did exist in the future,
当然啦 如果"天网"真的存在于未来世界

102
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,120
a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy
mankind would be to send Terminators back posing
那么完美潜入毁灭人类的方法就是
让派来的终结者

103
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,640
as actors who have played Terminators
in popular films and television series,
扮成曾在热门电影剧集中
饰演过终结者的演员

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,270
lulling us into a false
sense of security, i.e.,
让我们产生安全错觉 就像是

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,680
"That's Summer Glau "from
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
"她是<终结者 莎拉传>里的Summer Glau"

Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

Taking the train was
a stroke of brilliance!

I've actually got a
shot at a Terminator.
终于有机会接触终结者了

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,890
Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators,

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,300
you've got a better shot of
scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
我看你还是和施瓦辛格机会比较大

114

You're overlooking something.

I have 11 hours with
her in a confined space.
我将和她在这个狭窄的空间里
待上11个小时

116
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,550
Unless she's willing to jump off a moving
train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
除非她愿意跳下行驶的火车
翻转着滚下那边的山坡

117
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,930
she will eventually succumb to the
acquired taste that is ward Wolowitz.
她最终将屈服于逐渐产生好感的对象
那就是我 Howard Wolowitz

118
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,950
My money's on tuck and roll.
我压她滚下山

119
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,940
I'm confused.
我搞不懂了

120
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,130
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
我以为你和Leslie Winkle在社交上
保持着某种亲密关系

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,590
- Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.
- Sheldon 我来给你解释下
- 好吧

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,010
- That's Summer Glau.
- Yes.
- 那是Summer Glau耶!
- 是啊

123
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,870
That's it.
就这理由

124
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,170
Hang on a sec. Why do you
get first crack at her?
等等 凭什么是你第一个去追她?

125
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,890
Um, well, let's see, couple
reasons. One, I saw her first.
呃 我想想 几个理由
第一 我先看到她的

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,860
No, you didn't. I did.

127
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,780
Fair enough. But... then,
let me move on to #2.
那好吧 但是...我们说第二个理由吧

128
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,420
Unlike you, I can actually
talk to women when I'm sober.
和你不同 我能镇静地同一位女性交谈

129
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,900
You fail to take into account that
even mute, I am foreign and exotic,
你没有考虑到 即使不说话
我来自国外 有异国情调

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,510
while you, on the other
hand, are frail and pasty.
相反 而你呢 虚弱而苍白

131
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,070
Well, you know the old saying,
Pasty and frail never fail.
你知道有句老话吗
"虚弱苍白者从不失手"

132
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,850
Excuse me, but what about me?
打断一下 那还有我呢?

133
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,490
Why don't I get a shot?
咋没我的事了?

134
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,610
Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.
