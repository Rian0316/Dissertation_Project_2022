1
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:52,447
Good morning, my little furry friend.

2
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,811
Morning. Can I help you?

3
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,884
Morning. West London Dept. Of Sanitation.

4
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:15,363
You're probably aware
of the rodent infestation along this block?

5
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:18,206
- What are you talking about?
- Rats.

6
00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,282
They can be discreet.

7
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:22,570
But they can damage your stock
as well as spreading nasty diseases.

8
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:25,611
We don't have any rats!
Let me see some ID, please.

9
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:39,323
We'll be fumigating till about 12:00.
I'd keep out of the way till then.

10
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,171
And keep this to yourselves.

11
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:45,007
Discretion is always the best policy
where business reputations are concerned.

12
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:46,412
Thank you.

13
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:59,252
All right, she'll be here any minute.

14
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,927
- Better make yourself scarce.
- Yeah.

15
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:27,721
- Good morning, Miss Gates.
- Morning.

16
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,689
- Is this it, then?
- Yeah.

17
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:34,532
Come in.

18
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:38,281
I'll come right to the point, Mr. Pomeroy.

19
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:41,126
You're a chancer. A beautiful chancer.

20
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,082
But nevertheless, you're a furniture mover.

21
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,285
What could you possibly know
about fine art?

22
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,690
Are you really going to pay £500,000 for it?

23
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:58,852
Yes, I am.

24
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,131
Okay, no, I'm not.

25
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:05,967
My ceiling's actually £250,000...

26
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,329
but I'm looking for a partner
who can match me.

27
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,250
You know, if this is genuine,
it could be worth several million.

28
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,971
I don't doubt that.

29
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,762
Right. So, we will view the painting
at my gallery together.

30
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:24,163
If I am satisfied,
then I will consider going 50-50 with you.

31
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,403
That's incredibly generous, Miss Gates.

32
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:29,485
I do warn you, I take some convincing.

33
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,322
Bye.

34
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,130
Yes, we're on.

35
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,529
No, I'm staying put in Belgravia.

36
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,288
Nurse, for the love of God, get rid of this!

37
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,692
Unbelievable.

38
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,526
- Does that woman ever shut up?
- Tell me about it.

39
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,012
What you got, Ernie?

40
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,005
- Not much.
- What's that? Nothing.

41
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:02,961
Full house. Winner takes all, mate.

42
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:07,331
Listen. You might want to consider
watching that tell of yours.

43
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:12,210
A tell is a little giveaway sign.
Lets me know what you're thinking.

44
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,847
Like when you've got a good hand,
you start clapping...

45
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,401
and roaring with laughter. Think about it.

46
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,482
- See you.
- Good luck.

47
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:20,767
Nurse!

48
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:28,211
I don't care what he thinks it's worth,
go to £100,000 and no more.

49
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,730
Right, I'm taking a walk.
Send the car for me.

50
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:06,572
Is that...

51
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,731
Rachel's lawyer. She wants a settlement.

52
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,766
- How much?
- I guess that's in the envelope.

53
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,128
Gonna pay?

54
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,603
Don't rush me.
I haven't even decided to open it yet.

55
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,931
Come on, what's the matter?

56
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,765
I don't know.

57
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,766
Something just doesn't feel right.

58
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,572
Mickey, there's a man outside
looking for us. Me and Ash.

59
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,245
Except he's Harry and I'm Gordon.

60
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,121
- When he comes in here, tell him I'm dead.
- And I'm in China.

61
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,252
Look, I don't know
who you're talking about, mate.

62
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,325
- Do you expect me to believe that?
- I'm sorry.

63
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,245
Excuse me.
You're looking for Harry and Gordon.

64
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:52,129
I knew I had the right place.
I think I deserve a word with them.

65
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,202
I'm sorry, but they're...

66
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,284
Don't tell me. Out of the country.

67
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,887
Marrakesh. For the trade fair.

68
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,488
Well, when they get back,
tell them "well done" from me.

69
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,562
They did me good. Very clever.

70
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:08,487
If they want to see
how clever they've been, here's my card.

71
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,402
It was while you were inside.

72
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:19,924
Yeah, we was bored of the small fish.

73
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,891
We made one call from here.
One ruddy call.

74
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,771
And Naveen gets an itemized phone bill
and he traces you.

75
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,491
That's Chapter One, boys.

76
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,724
No, it was sweet, Mickey.
The rag trade, but international.

77
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,043
The Rolex, the Jag.
Worked the whole thing up.

78
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,532
I looked like Rockefeller.

79
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,808
I roped in the mark, Naveen.

80
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,929
Has a T-shirt factory.

81
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,521
- You did that?
- Yeah.

82
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,930
We planned on £20,000,
but he wanted in for £50,000.

83
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,925
If we'd known he was in trouble,
we would have left him alone.

84
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:50,004
But he was acting the big man.

85
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,368
You took money from a desperate man.

86
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,648
Is that what we are? Muggers?

87
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,164
We thought he could afford to be fleeced.

88
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,562
We ripped him off in good faith.

89
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,203
This explains a lot
of what I've been feeling recently.

90
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,564
I think we're under a jinx.

91
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,961
Come on.

92
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,009
Why do we have codes, Ash?

93
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,646
Because it's a decent thing.

94
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,328
No, the decent thing is not to grift at all.

95
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:21,452
And we have a code
because bad behavior makes bad luck.

96
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,450
There's no jinx, mate.

97
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:26,368
Cut.

98
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,647
Maybe we did pick the wrong mark.

99
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,163
But it felt so good
to be the inside man again, Mickey.

100
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,448
You know, to feel that glow.

101
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,606
Receivers. You can practically smell them.

102
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,452
Rachel says I dragged her life
into the gutter.

103
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,489
I don't see it that way.

104
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:17,210
But taking a desperate man
for his last penny.

105
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:22,130
You always say
we have to live by our decision.

106
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,322
And can you live with this one?

107
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,448
One bag. And that's that.

108
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:16,010
It's all right, I'm a friend of the sculptor's.

109
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,843
Yeah. Impressive piece.

110
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,564
Impressive use of the blobs there.

111
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:39,723
I wonder what compelled him.

112
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:45,083
I think if you look
at the artist's earlier works...

113
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:46,447
it becomes obvious.

114
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,445
Earlier work? This is the only one.

115
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,809
He was 19 when he died.

116
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,249
I was thinking more of his childhood stuff.

117
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,286
You know, some of his early pieces
that he did in crayon.

118
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,607
Teasing.

119
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,448
What's it worth? £20,000.
I'll think about it anyway.

120
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,567
Of course, the Gates Gallery
is usually viewed by appointment.

121
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:18,011
- Are you one of her inner circle?
- No.

122
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,571
I just think that art is for everyone.

123
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:27,606
Not when everyone includes all
the poor struggling dealers and buyers...

124
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,412
- that she's ripped off over the years.
- How true.

125
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:34,281
Meredith Gates likes to keep mere mortals
at a safe distance.

126
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:39,448
Dali's sketches go for inflated prices
to satisfy vanity-driven eccentrics...

127
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,364
with no real art appreciation.

128
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:45,844
At least that's what I told him
before I paid him a third of their real value.

129
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:50,770
I've been hoping to write an article on her,
maybe even an exposé.

130
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,891
Just look at her.

131
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,442
The only reason she's opened
to the proles...

132
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,889
is because she wants maximum publicity
for her new Mondrians.

133
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,090
- God, you're not a friend of hers, are you?
- No.

134
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,921
I am after a Mondrian myself.

135
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,764
They're just for show.

136
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,768
Bea Watson, art journalist.

137
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,887
Daniel Pomeroy, collector.

138
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,446
You're not really after a Mondrian,
are you?

139
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,001
I mean,
Meredith would kill for another one.

140
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,972
That piece in the middle
she bought for £250,000.

141
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,370
Right. This is Piet Mondrian.

142
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,529
Born in Holland, 1872.

143
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:15,002
These are a few of his paintings.

144
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,652
Quite nice,
but they don't blow your bollocks off.

145
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,123
Suddenly in 1909...

146
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,771
in comes the hippy shit.

147
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,764
Few years later, this.

148
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,932
Pay attention at the back.
This is for your benefit.

149
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,130
Most people reckon
that Mondrian got all fired up...

150
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,681
after seeing an exhibition by Picasso...

151
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:38,368
and that's when he started
boshing out the psychedelic trees.

152
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,411
But there's a mystery involved.

153
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:47,684
Some claim that Mondrian was
playing around with abstract art...

154
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,606
before Picasso even had a sniff.

155
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,612
But because he was
such an unassuming bloke...

156
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,092
he kept it to himself...

157
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,802
and only went public after Picasso.

158
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,369
And do we know
what that would mean, class?

159
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,849
Mondrian could've invented
a new type of art...

160
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,691
but Picasso took all the glory.

161
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,291
Give that man an A-plus.

162
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,968
All right, so you've been to an art gallery
and read a book.

163
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,692
What's all this got to do with six figures?

164
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:23,412
Well, suppose the mystery was solved.

165
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:29,528
Supposing a painting was discovered
that was dated, say, 1902 or 1903...

166
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,930
- before Picasso invented...
- Cubism.

167
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,288
Before Picasso invented Cubism.

168
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:38,092
And say this painting was a Mondrian...

169
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,805
it would turn art history on its head.

170
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,766
Exactly. And it's not like
we gotta give them the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

171
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,083
We've got the mark, okay?
Meredith Gates.

172
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,641
We've got the bait: Mondrian.

173
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,772
We fake the right painting,
and all we gotta tell her...

174
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,966
is how many noughts to put on the check.

175
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,731
Let's take a walk.

176
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,369
Have you heard of Icarus?

177
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:17,330
'Course I have.
He's a Bond villain, ain't he?

178
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:21,285
Icarus flew too close to the sun
and got burnt.

179
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206
Well, Mickey, guys like me don't get burnt.

180
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:25,885
We get tanned.

181
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,526
And what if we're jinxed?

182
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,251
You talking about the grifter's jinx?

183
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,087
Albert getting strapped by that gangster,
then you picking up an extra bullet.

184
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,528
You know, we're not accountants, are we?

185
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,762
Shit happens.

186
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:40,846
No, it's a bad vibe.
I can feel it, and it's right on our heads.

187
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,085
I've told you before, boys,
Lara Croft is never gonna reply.

188
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,530
No, this is a website for art dealers
and antique buffs to swap stories.

189
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,650
I'm running an e-mail conversation
with meself.

190
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,527
In Dutch.

191
00:14:56,613 --> 00:15:00,162
So what are your two fictional Dutchmen
talking about?

192
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,289
Mickey said no.

193
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:11,284
I know. We got two art dealers
gossiping about this new painting.

194
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:14,883
One guy says to the other one,
"Keep this to yourself."

195
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,006
Now if that don't create a buzz,
nothing will, will it?

196
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,653
So you wanna draw Meredith Gates
into this?

197
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:24,442
If word gets to her that there's
this mysterious new Mondrian out there...

198
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,922
then suddenly it'll be a lot better for us.

199
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,325
Marks are so much softer when they think
they're the ones doing the running.

200
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,644
And you think this will persuade Mickey
to go along with it?

201
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,325
There's no jinx.

202
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:39,291
When we pull this one off he'll see that.

203
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,168
He'll need a lot of persuading.

204
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,362
I know he will.

205
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,288
<i>That's why I'm working on it.</i>

206
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,608
Mr. Hook.

207
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,323
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Not at all.

208
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,892
And this must be...

209
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,851
Jeremiah Hook. Bea Watson, art journalist.

210
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,453
I'm not entirely sure
why I'm here, Mr. Hook.

211
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,605
Don't tell me you're here
under false pretenses.

212
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:43,844
- There you go. I took the liberty.
- Yes, you did.

213
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,366
I can't stay long.

214
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:49,332
I've got a piece to deliver to <i>Art World</i>
magazine and I can't upset the editor.

215
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,722
Okay, let's cut straight to the chase.

216
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,964
Mr. Hook is
an international antiques dealer.

217
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:58,648
He's recently come into possession
of a small oil.

218
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,611
What sort of oil?

219
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:05,125
Well, it was signed by Piet Mondrian,
dated 1902.

220
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:08,330
There's a buzz about a new work
on the Internet.

221
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:09,932
Can I see it?

222
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,523
Do you have it here in town?

223
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,731
What you could do for us, Bea,
is authenticate it.

224
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:20,283
And in return I'd give you exclusive rights.

225
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,767
To what?

226
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,209
I may buy this painting.

227
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:27,445
It is small but it is significant.

228
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:31,123
I certainly could interest
a few gallery publications.

229
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:34,212
But I'm sorry,
I wouldn't describe an early Mondrian...

230
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,205
as all that significant to the wider world.

231
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,808
I have to go.

232
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,691
So do I. Forget we had this meeting.

233
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:46,568
There's no story here.
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

234
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,573
What do you mean, there's no story here?

235
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,609
- Just that.
- Actually...

236
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,683
- there is a story.
- Actually, there isn't a story.

237
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,443
It's more than just a regular landscape,
isn't it?

238
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,922
Of course not. 1902? No.

239
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,805
All right, Mr. Hook.

240
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,524
If you change your mind...

241
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:15,171
Sorry. I really have to go.

242
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:17,692
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

243
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,241
Hello.

244
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,891
How did you know I'd turn up?

245
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,168
Because I scented the invite.

246
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:32,368
Did you have to go and gut the whole plan
like a kipper?

247
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,967
Did you not just see what happened there?

248
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,162
Waiter.

249
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,450
She wasn't interested until she thought
that I wasn't interested.

250
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,444
Now she's intrigued.

251
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,407
Sorry, we can't drink this. It's sour.

252
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,324
Remember, Tip Jones is the best forger
in the business...

253
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,881
but I trust him about as far
as I can throw a horsebox.

254
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,646
He plays mind games.
He'll have you chasing your own tail.

255
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,201
He's got a brain like a steel trap.

256
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,732
There we go.

257
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:19,365
Well, you hear about people
reacting badly to anesthetic, don't you?

258
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,886
Hernia op.

259
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:23,566
Bloody tragic.

260
00:19:27,573 --> 00:19:29,291
I'm Mickey Stone.

261
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,889
- We're out of here.
- Wait.

262
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,207
What for?

263
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:40,283
If we stay any longer,
he's gonna sing <i>I'm a Little Teapot...</i>

264
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:42,682
and he's gonna poop in his hand.

265
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,325
The show is over, Tip.

266
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,688
We're here on serious business.

267
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:52,530
If you do this job right,
you're in for £100,000.

268
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,086
So stop playing silly buggers.

269
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,528
£150,000. Take it or leave it.

270
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,803
...belonged to the <i>Venus de Milo.</i>

271
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:08,088
Going out to Texas next week.

272
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:11,768
So this gallery owner's
trying to get me on a forgery rap.

273
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:13,571
Forgery? <i>Moi?</i>

274
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,962
I don't forge, I clone.

275
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,525
Anyhow, the whole trial's redundant
if I can't stand.

276
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:21,444
Hence the performance.

277
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,371
So what do you think
of this Mondrian scam?

278
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,804
Pre-Picasso. Very cute.

279
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,729
Total cobblers, of course.
You wouldn't fool Saatchi's pet gerbil.

280
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,963
But I thought you were good.

281
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,770
Forgeries are generally sold
to wealthy idiots.

282
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,612
Movie stars, Japanese fishing barons
who never bother...

283
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:42,012
to get them checked out.

284
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:45,165
You want to flog a fake Mondrian
to Meredith Gates...

285
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,687
a leading Mondrian collector.

286
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:50,003
Okay. What do you need?

287
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:54,447
A dozen Italian horsehair brushes,
sizes <i>4</i> to 9.

288
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:57,287
Reconstituted canvas circa the period.

289
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,251
Not that that will get us
around the carbon-dating.

290
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,490
Yes, and an original.

291
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,370
Come on. We can get you a print.

292
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:06,409
I got pictures in books.

293
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,969
I need to smell, caress, taste.

294
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,051
I need a real Mondrian sitting beside me.

295
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,448
After all, you're talking about
originating a new piece.

296
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,882
This has to be perfect.

297
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:10,406
<i>Hold on. Calm down.</i>

298
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,892
Can you hold on to that, please?

299
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:14,533
- Sit there.
- That was a shambles.

300
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,327
Now get me Miss Gates.
I need to speak with her at once.

301
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,290
What? She's in Bristol.

302
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,489
Well, get her on the phone.

303
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:26,043
A man walks into your gallery
and lifts a valuable painting off the wall.

304
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,772
Why wasn't it bolted down?
Where's your laser protection?

305
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,889
I've seen garden centers
with better security.

306
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,965
- There's the cameras...
- What's the downtime on the Mondrians?

307
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,851
Those paintings must be out of shot
for, what, 30 seconds?

308
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,730
Only 20, as it goes.

309
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:41,328
Who are you?

310
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:44,007
Debonair Security Assessments.
As you may be aware...

311
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:47,085
there's been some recent theft attempts
on London galleries.

312
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:50,449
The Arts Council asked us to check
what measures you have in place...

313
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,522
for insurance purposes.

314
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:55,242
We have the X-ray machines,
and all the frames are tagged.

315
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:56,767
You don't tag the canvases?

316
00:22:56,853 --> 00:23:00,971
No. Miss Gates' instructions.
No one tampers with the paintings.

317
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:04,450
Look, I think I'd better call Miss Gates.

318
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:07,213
Yeah, recall her from Bristol early.

319
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,008
She won't be annoyed, will she?

320
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,528
Just tell me one thing.

321
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,922
We did all right, didn't we?

322
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:24,884
Gents, it is not often
that a Debonair assessor is impressed...

323
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:29,047
but this one just learnt the meaning
of the word "humility."

324
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,962
Here's the period canvas you asked for.

325
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,601
This is for you.

326
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:43,811
It won't pass close scrutiny
but it should do the job for the swap.

327
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,963
Good. I'll be back with the original.

328
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,766
One, please.

329
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,407
Rest of my party are on the coach.

330
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:19,724
- Party?
- Mondrian Appreciation Society.

331
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,292
All right.

332
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:25,486
I don't know if it's the economy of form
or the elegance of his asymmetry...

333
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:29,009
but he sets me alight. Is that crazy?

334
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,282
What's this?

335
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,682
That is the visitors' record.
Sign it, if you like.

336
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,207
I'll sign it. I'll sign right now.

337
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:54,932
To you, free.

338
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,365
Thank you. That is so kind of you.

339
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:16,086
We handle these Mondrians all the time.

340
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,488
It's another day at the office, really.

341
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,801
Stop it.

342
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,131
I like that crazy Dutch Neo-Plasticist.

343
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,451
<i>You're right.</i>

344
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,888
They're kind of late, don't you think?

345
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,892
- Where are the loos? I'm peeing my pants.
- Right this way.

346
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,885
- Behind you. Straight through.
- Thanks.

347
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,961
See you.

348
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:33,412
Wait. Where are you off to?

349
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,372
What do you mean?

350
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:38,250
What about your coach party?

351
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,411
Wouldn't be the same.

352
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,166
I like things a little more one-to-one.

353
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:48,404
Know what I mean? Bye.

354
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:56,966
For future reference, it's a good idea
when transporting a painting like this...

355
00:26:57,053 --> 00:27:00,523
to use a muslin bag. Non-abrasive.

356
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:05,805
You gotta help me rearrange this place.
Tables there. Chairs in a row.

357
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,327
Mondrian believed in order. So must I.

358
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:10,563
It really does it for you, doesn't it? Art.

359
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,052
Doesn't it for you?

360
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,169
Listen, mate. My mum had a painting.

361
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:16,289
Got it out of <i>The Mail on Sunday.</i> Massive.

362
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,524
- A lot of dogs playing snooker.
- Brushes?

363
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:24,283
- These need to be distressed in vinegar.
- Already done.

364
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:28,492
And here are the oils you asked for.
High lead content as requested.

365
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:31,212
Got them off the Net.
Different suppliers for each tube.

366
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:34,649
You asked for five tins of pilchards. Why?

367
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:40,287
It's a beach scene,
so I took a trip to Brighton.

368
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,168
Here's your pot of seawater.

369
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:46,609
And here, I thought
if he was painting on a beach...

370
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:51,290
the sand would have gotten caught
on the sticky canvas.

371
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,324
In 11 days...

372
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:58,247
an original Mondrian from 1902
will be in your possession.

373
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:02,848
It will, for a brief time,
fool the greatest art experts in the world...

374
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,562
and it will dethrone Picasso
as the father of modern art.

375
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:12,168
Or it will be spotted immediately
and we'll all go to prison for several years.

376
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,802
- May I take these matches?
- Yeah, sure.

377
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,610
Hi. Sorry.

378
00:28:58,853 --> 00:28:59,922
I'm so glad you called.

379
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:02,208
I'm sorry about the other day.
I was a bit hasty.

380
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:03,806
You can't be too careful.

381
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:07,124
Tell me,
was this piece uncovered in Amersfoort?

382
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,764
Let's get some drinks.

383
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,168
Come on. Amersfoort.

384
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,451
<i>Excuse me. Could I have a cranberry juice</i>
<i>and a Sea Breeze for the lady?</i>

385
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:22,126
A town in central Holland,
Mondrian's birthplace.

386
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,852
Yes, it would have been nice
if it had been uncovered...

387
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,083
in Mondrian's hometown. But alas, not.

388
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,606
Do you have a photo?

389
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:30,331
No, I carry nothing with me.

390
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:33,371
But I cannot stress
the explosive significance of this find.

391
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,489
I've been thinking about that.

392
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,168
Could this be a piece
from the Spanish expedition?

393
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,445
Why do you say that?

394
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,969
Hang fire. We're on to it.

395
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:48,407
Albert.

396
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:52,649
The Great Spanish Exhibition of 1921.

397
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:57,163
The Great Spanish Exhibition of 1921.

398
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:01,085
No, I'm talking about
Mondrian's trip to Spain.

399
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,807
- Of course.
- Expedition.

400
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,762
What a deaf cretin.

401
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,042
Hurry up. He's sitting there like a lemon.

402
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,361
Hold on.

403
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,447
Mr. Hook, you're leaving me dangling.

404
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:23,008
You think that this piece heralds
from the trip Mondrian took to Spain...

405
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:26,290
with his best friend Simon Maris in 1901.

406
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:28,850
"As you know, no writing..."

407
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,049
...or painting remains from that trip.

408
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,966
"Possible, though,
that he might have met Picasso."

409
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,924
Do you think he may have
met Picasso out there?

410
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,802
I knew it!

411
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:43,408
You've uncovered an abstract Mondrian
that predates Cubism.

412
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,805
I have a small painting
that needs verification.

413
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:51,685
I would like an expert journalist
on hand to assist.

414
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,684
The wider world will have to be convinced.

415
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:56,765
And they will be. In an exclusive.

416
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,087
Why me?

417
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,404
Why pick a fledgling writer?

418
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:07,211
You're not a cynic.

419
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,646
You have no axe to grind.

420
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,965
And you strike me
as being open to adventure.

421
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:19,170
<i>Just you wait.</i>
<i>You wait until you can see it and touch it.</i>

422
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:21,730
<i>- When?</i>
<i>- Very soon.</i>

423
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:29,568
You do believe me, don't you?

424
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,321
Actually, I do.

425
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,690
Nobody does it better.

426
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:40,165
- Makes me feel sad for the rest.
- Yeah, right.

427
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:42,047
Sorry, Stacie.

428
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:47,284
You already knew about
Meredith Gates' interest, didn't you?

429
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:48,522
Did I?

430
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,371
I know Mr. Pomeroy is keen to buy it.

431
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,923
He's seeing Miss Gates today.
Now, in fact. He told me.

432
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:57,813
Well, he may be looking
for a buying partner.

433
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:01,007
He's dancing with a scorpion there.

434
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,246
I have to go.

435
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,086
Your bill, sir.

436
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:16,361
My friends are picking up the tab.

437
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,402
So you went to see Meredith Gates
behind my back?

438
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,563
All I did was froth her up a bit, you know.

439
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,611
I told her I was gonna buy the painting
for £500,000.

440
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:30,571
You know, just take a gamble on it.
She got all agitated.

441
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,881
I'm telling you, Mickey...

442
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:34,282
when we're ready
to show Meredith this painting...

443
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,125
she's gonna be so jazzed about it...

444
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:39,364
she's gonna snap it up
for £500,000 minimum...

445
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,368
just to swipe it from under my nose.

446
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,444
Seems this meeting has been
all for the good.

447
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,649
Yes, definitely. Very good.

448
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:50,491
There is
a teensy-weensy problem, though.

449
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:54,608
Meredith thinks I run
an import-export company in West Ken.

450
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:58,368
And she's coming over tomorrow at 11:00
with her decision.

451
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:04,292
Good morning, my little furry friend.

452
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:11,888
Rats.

453
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:24,407
- Good morning, Miss Gates.
- Morning.

454
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,246
Are you really going to pay £500,000 for it?

455
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,922
My ceiling's actually £250,000...

456
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,449
but I'm looking for a partner
who can match me.

457
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:38,008
You know, if this is genuine,
it could be worth several million.

458
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:42,731
Despite appearances,
Mr. Hook is not a wealthy man.

459
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,930
And if it does turn out
to be worth millions...

460
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:48,768
I think it's only right that he gets a cut.

461
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,764
Mr. Hook will only get what we give him.

462
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:53,287
If he wants any more,
he can burn up his £500,000...

463
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:54,647
chasing me through the courts.

464
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:58,328
Right. So, we will view the painting
at my gallery together.

465
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,644
If I am satisfied,
then I will consider going 50-50 with you.

466
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,008
That's incredibly generous, Miss Gates.

467
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:08,443
So you'll arrange this meeting
with Mr. Hook?

468
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,526
Sure. I've also invited a journalist,
Bea Watson.

469
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:16,767
I thought if this thing's genuine,
we should bang the drum.

470
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:19,249
Only if it's good news.

471
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:27,882
Bye.

472
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:30,885
Yes, we're on.

473
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,448
We are so far from the jackpot.

474
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:40,202
Any time you wanna give me
some encouragement, just feel free.

475
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,487
This is not a club.

476
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:44,326
You're not earning a scouting badge
for Grifting Grade <i>4</i>.

477
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:46,483
We are taking a person down
for a lot of money.

478
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:48,450
And we have so many hoops
to jump through...

479
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,047
not least of which
is a painting we haven't seen yet...

480
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,125
painted by a man we can't trust.
And we are also art thieves.

481
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,681
- Cool.
- It is not cool, Danny!

482
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:58,923
We're not crooks. We're miners.

483
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,642
We mine people's greed.
And these people can be dangerous.

484
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,730
All I'm saying is that
given our current form...

485
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,450
I'm not about to start
letting off champagne corks.

486
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,683
Then why do it if you don't believe in it?

487
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:15,570
Because we need the money.

488
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,121
- What do you need the money for?
- You'll see.

489
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,771
Will I like it?

490
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:24,407
Come on, we've got a lot of work to do.

491
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:27,371
The painting will be ready
in just one week.

492
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,923
- All right, how am I looking?
- Beautiful.

493
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,049
Okay, so how about a good-luck kiss?

494
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:45,327
Let's go.

495
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:59,324
Where's Meredith?

496
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:06,327
I hope you don't mind me
bringing my godchildren along.

497
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:08,483
They're on their way
to a sixth birthday party.

498
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,370
The theme is Renaissance.

499
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,250
Off you go and play.

500
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,883
They grow up so fast, don't they?

501
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,203
Cheeky little fellows, aren't they?

502
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,644
Where's the painting?

503
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,363
Mr. Hook is bringing it even as we speak.

504
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,087
Come on.

505
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,728
Pilchards!
What is this thing with pilchards?

506
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,168
- Hello.
<i>- Good, you found the key.</i>

507
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:51,484
- Where's the painting?
<i>- Silver case, top of the cupboard.</i>

508
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,608
Excuse me.

509
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:30,563
What the hell is going on?

510
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,448
Mr. Pomeroy's assistant. Oh, Mr. Hook.

511
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,491
I've got the case, but it's locked.

512
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,848
There's no way to open it
without a detonator.

513
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,128
That's no problem. Hang on a minute.

514
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,202
Hello.

515
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,569
We need a code to get into the case.

516
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:53,566
Yeah? You can relax on that.
I've got that right here.

517
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:55,845
<i>- Text it to me.</i>
- Absolutely.

518
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:57,002
Right.

519
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:05,049
Albert, we're running late. Where are you?

520
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,364
In position. Don't worry about us,
just do your job, son.

521
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:09,762
Right.

522
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:15,727
You did bring your half?

523
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:18,930
Yeah, ma'am. Banker's draft for £250,000...

524
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,406
right here.

525
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,444
Two minutes, I'm leaving.

526
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,530
That's it. I'm leaving.
Come along, my cherubs.

527
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,322
Sorry.

528
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,692
Sorry to have kept
you good people waiting.

529
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,491
Traffic was awful.

530
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,286
Is this it?

531
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,213
- Excited?
- Yes, indeed.

532
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:02,442
This case is security-coded
and I have the code...

533
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:05,001
here on my phone.

534
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:30,886
Signed Piet Mondrian, 1902.

535
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:34,413
It's in a style
he wasn't supposed to employ until...

536
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:35,892
Years later.

537
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,567
There's quite a bit of dust
embedded in the top layer.

538
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,250
Picture has a smell.

539
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:48,927
Fishy. Rank. Decay.

540
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,931
Bears many of the hallmarks
that Mondrian used later on...

541
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,164
but it's interesting.
There's a hesitancy about it.

542
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:02,731
Almost like an artist trying
something very new and scaring himself.

543
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:05,761
My God.

544
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,043
Well, if it's not a fake...

545
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,164
then "My God," indeed.

546
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,487
This is only an initial assessment,
of course...

547
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:41,929
but it would appear that this work
bears the traits of a Mondrian...

548
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,481
painted at the turn of the century.

549
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:49,485
But this picture was painted
on a fine-quality canvas.

550
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:53,652
Mondrian wouldn't have wasted
a top canvas on experimental work...

551
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,610
that was unlikely to sell.

552
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:56,842
He may have done.

553
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:59,049
The man was meticulous
and he was frugal.

554
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,044
Most of his work was done on cardboard.

555
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,010
Perhaps it was a commission.

556
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,572
A commission?

557
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:11,808
Nobody would have paid
for something like this back then.

558
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,885
Anyway, if it was a commission,
we'd have records.

559
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,761
It would seem, Mr. Hook,
that the circus is over.

560
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:24,210
What if he was hired
to paint something traditional...

561
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:28,605
so he splashed out on a good canvas,
but the commission fell through...

562
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:31,010
so he reused it?

563
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,965
- The canvas.
- Yeah.

564
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,324
I like the sound of that.

565
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,686
Follow me.

566
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:46,412
If what you say is correct, Miss Watson,
then there should be another painting...

567
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,563
hidden underneath here somewhere.

568
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,007
Nothing.

569
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,530
As far as I'm concerned, you can burn it.

570
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,286
Wait. If I adjust the resolution...

571
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:06,966
A pentimento!

572
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,732
A hidden landscape underneath. You see?

573
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:15,326
When the commission fell through,
Mondrian must have been furious.

574
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,529
He vented his frustration
in something radical.

575
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:20,764
A beach scene like no other, ever.

576
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:23,886
Mr. Hook...

577
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:31,806
I will give you £500,000 right now, in cash.

578
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,969
Sorry. What about my half?

579
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,805
In cash, Mr. Hook.

580
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:39,208
I might get five times that at auction.

581
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,442
If it's genuine.

582
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:41,727
You still don't think so?

583
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,452
Put it this way.
I'm persuaded to take a risk.

584
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,967
But only if I have sole possession.

585
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:51,808
I've a banker's draft here for £250,000!

586
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,453
Mr. Hook, do we have a deal?

587
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:58,566
Don't you dare.

588
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,082
Deal.

589
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,850
I've played a blinder, I'm telling you.

590
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,527
Even when Meredith discovers it's a fake...

591
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:25,649
she's not gonna want to do anything
about it.

592
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:29,203
There's no way she'd want her name
splashed all over the papers.

593
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,763
So, minus Tip's fee and other expenses,
we're looking at...

594
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:33,888
£60,000 each.

595
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:37,090
That dream beach-house of mine
is starting to look a lot closer.

596
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:40,006
I can't believe you went
for all that bad karma shit, Mickey.

597
00:43:40,093 --> 00:43:43,085
A man creates his own luck
in this world, son.

598
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:54,528
£150,000.

599
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:58,686
Ta very much,
but I'll take the lot, if you don't mind.

600
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,322
What?

601
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:03,689
Right now a friend of mine
is waiting to call the police.

602
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:07,527
They will tell the cops a Mondrian
has been stolen from the Gates Gallery.

603
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,569
They will give them your names.

604
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:13,009
The cops will arrest you.
They will find said painting.

605
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:14,685
You will go to prison.

606
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:18,652
And what is more, your identities
will be blown by the national press.

607
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:22,009
That will make it very hard for you
to pull off any more cons...

608
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,129
in sophisticated society.

609
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,971
But there is salvation.

610
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:29,045
Give me the half mil,
the call is never made.

611
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,403
Do you ever shut up, Tip?

612
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:34,605
You've got all these fine things
around you.

613
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:38,410
You've got all your clever talk
and all your yap.

614
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:42,442
But you know what you are?
You're just a tosser.

615
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:45,333
Caravaggio was a vicious queen.

616
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:47,768
Michelangelo shagged little boys.

617
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,684
Bacon was an alcoholic.

618
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:53,766
And Gauguin married a 13-year-old girl.
Welcome to the art world.

619
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:58,890
Just like your world, Danny. We are
merely cockroaches with good tailors.

620
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:03,125
So who is this friend of yours
that's gonna call the cops then, Tip?

621
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:05,529
I don't think you need to know.

622
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:06,768
Easy.

623
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:12,006
You can learn a lot from Mickey.
He knows how to behave.

624
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,685
I certainly do.

625
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,244
Ten seconds, I reckon.

626
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,972
Ten seconds. Until what?

627
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:20,446
I called them earlier...

628
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:23,650
and I think I just heard
a car pull up outside.

629
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:28,122
- 3, 2, 1...
- What is this?

630
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:31,683
D.S. Martins, Fraud Squad.

631
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,924
Yes, come in, officer.

632
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:41,331
You remember me, don't you, Mr. Jones?

633
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:44,526
We've had a call from a neighbor.

634
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,963
He says he saw you walking in the park,
Mr. Jones.

635
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:51,529
Now, what with our investigation
under suspension on medical grounds...

636
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:55,128
we felt it best to pop down here
and have a little chat.

637
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,925
We'll be off then.

638
00:45:57,373 --> 00:46:00,763
Bye-bye, Mr. Jones. Nice to see you.

639
00:46:02,253 --> 00:46:03,606
Lot of money here, sir.

640
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:05,809
Yes. Nothing to do with us.

641
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,486
- You knew he was gonna turn.
- I was pretty sure.

642
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:15,645
- We could have lost the lot.
- I told you, flying close to the sun.

643
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,122
But Tip can still turn us in
with that painting.

644
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:19,771
What's she doing here?

645
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:31,926
Very clever. Give them back.

646
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:35,651
Danny, this is the person
who calls the cops...

647
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,247
and tells them
where to find a stolen Mondrian.

648
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,211
Forgers often use students
to fence their forgeries.

649
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,931
She's a grifter?

650
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:45,847
I'm a serious arts writer, thank you.

651
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,122
Where did you meet Tip?

652
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:49,249
At college.
That's where they usually recruit.

653
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,210
Everyone at college knew Tip.

654
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:54,172
After you visited him, Tip called me...

655
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:56,964
and we sort of came up with this.

656
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:59,442
Great. So what happens now?

657
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:02,451
How about you keep your money...

658
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,130
and I'll hang on to the Mondrian.

659
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:08,444
No, the Mondrian has to go back.
That's the way we work.

660
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,728
Well, it's not the way I work.

661
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,487
Well, if you can live with that...

662
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,645
What are you doing here?

663
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,372
- How'd it go, boys?
- Not bad.

664
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:37,802
Don't! You all right?

665
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:41,010
Don't worry, it was my fault.
I stepped out in front of you.

666
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:42,128
I didn't even see you.

667
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:45,011
Can't bend me leg. I landed awkward.

668
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:46,572
It never happened to me before.

669
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:50,407
Look at that, I can move it.
Don't worry, love, I'll be fine.

670
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:53,891
Yeah, it was nice working the flop again.

671
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:57,443
So how did you know she was lying?

672
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,012
At the cocktail bar.

673
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:01,932
You do believe me, don't you?

674
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,890
<i>She revealed a tell.</i>

675
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:07,283
Actually, I do.

676
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,806
<i>I double-checked it.</i>

677
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:10,121
Excited?

678
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:13,008
<i>The throat-slash. A classic tell.</i>

679
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,082
Yes, indeed.

680
00:48:14,173 --> 00:48:16,687
<i>Usually associated with feelings of guilt.</i>

681
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,843
So you double-guessed the double-cross.

682
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,208
I just took out some insurance.

683
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,772
Well, take away the expenses...

684
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:26,963
we've still got over £300,000 in the pot.

685
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:30,170
£200,000.
£100,000 is going somewhere else.

686
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:35,927
Where?

687
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,965
No, no way. You can't.

688
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:44,204
I'm sorry. But if we don't,
this man loses everything because of us.

689
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:46,204
And that'll jinx us forever.

690
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,249
You don't believe all this crap,
do you, Ash?

691
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,607
We gotta do it, Danny.

692
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,923
- Stace?
- Let it go, Danny.

693
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,245
Look, £100,000 pays Naveen back
and makes amends.

694
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,891
Danny, we're not thieves.

695
00:48:57,973 --> 00:48:59,326
Danny, come on.

696
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:01,881
This was my grift, all right?

697
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,565
You should've told me.

698
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:06,848
You're right. I'm sorry.

699
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:11,248
Okay, Danny,
you decide what happens next.

700
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:14,405
Danny, come on.

701
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:17,933
Only please make sure
whatever decision you make...

702
00:49:18,013 --> 00:49:19,731
you can live with.

703
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:22,608
Because what's done is done.

704
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:33,203
As you know, the receivers are in.

705
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:38,449
...so sorry, everyone.

706
00:50:32,653 --> 00:50:35,690
Bollocks. It's only money, isn't it?

707
00:50:36,253 --> 00:50:38,972
Anyway, I've got a great new idea.

708
00:50:39,093 --> 00:50:41,527
Right, clear your minds, picture this:

709
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:45,288
We've got half of a cow,
a small Shetland pony...

710
00:50:45,373 --> 00:50:47,603
- and some embalming...
- Tell me later.

711
00:50:47,693 --> 00:50:51,447
I'm glad this silly matter is settled.
Come on, I'm buying. My round.

712
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:54,366
That envelope from Rachel's lawyer.

713
00:50:55,213 --> 00:50:56,612
Did you ever open it?

714
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:59,127
Yeah. I've decided to pay her off.

715
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:01,642
- Jinx lifted?
- Well...

716
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:52,642
English
