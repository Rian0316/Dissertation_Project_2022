00:01:18,293 --> 00:01:19,282
老鼠做事很谨慎
They can be discreet.

11
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:22,570
它们会损坏你的库存以及传播肮脏的疾病
But they can damage your stock as well as spreading nasty diseases.

12
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:25,611
我们这儿没有老鼠 请让我看看你们的证件
We don't have any rats!Let me see some ID,please.

We'll be fumigating till about 12:00.I'd keep out of the way till then.

15
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,171

And keep this to yourselves.

16
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:45,007

24
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:41,126
你是个投机者 一个不错的投机者
You're a chancer.A beautiful chancer.

25
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,082
但你还只是个家具搬运商
But nevertheless,you're a furniture mover.

26
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,285
你对于杰出的艺术可能知道多少?
What could you possibly know about fine art?

27
00:02:52,493 --> 00:02:55,690
你真的准备出500,000买这个吗?
Are you really going to pay 500,000 for it?

28
00:02:57,533 --> 00:02:58,852
是的
Yes,I am.

29
00:03:01,413 --> 00:03:03,131
好吧 我不准备

我的最高只能出到250,000镑
My ceiling's actually 250,000...

31
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:09,329
但是我在寻找一个适合我的合伙人
but I'm looking for a partner who can match me.

32
00:03:12,133 --> 00:03:15,250
你知道 如果这是真的,它会值几百万
You know,if this is genuine,it could be worth several million.

33
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,971
对此我没有怀疑
I don't doubt that.

34
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,762
好的 我们一起去我的画廊看看这画
Right.So,we will view the painting at my gallery together.

35
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:24,163
如果我感到满意 我会考虑和你五五分成
If I am satisfied,then I will consider going 50-50 with you.

36
00:03:24,253 --> 00:03:26,403
Gates小姐 你真是太慷慨了
That's incredibly generous,Miss Gates.

37
00:03:26,493 --> 00:03:29,485
我警告你 我听取有信服力的
I do warn you,I take some convincing.

40
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,529
不 我还在进入Berlgravia中
No,I'm staying put in Belgravia.

41
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,288
护士 看在老天的份上 弄掉它
Nurse,for the love of God,get rid of this!

42
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:49,692
难以置信
Unbelievable.

43
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,526
- 那女人从不闭嘴吗? - 告诉我
- Does that woman ever shut up? - Tell me about it.

44
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,012
Ernie 你有什么?
What you got,Ernie?

45
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,005
- 不多 - 那是什么?没什么
- Not much. - What's that?Nothing.

46
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:02,961
三张相同和二张相同的牌 胜者拿走全部 
Full house.Winner takes all,mate.

47
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:07,331
听者 你或许想好好考虑注意下你的肯定
Listen.You might want to consider watching that tell of yours.

48
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:12,210
但肯定会稍稍泄漏你的牌 让我知道你在想什么
A tell is a little giveaway sign.Lets me know what you're thinking.

49
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:14,847
就像当你有个好帮手之后 你开始鼓掌
Like when you've got a good hand,you start clapping...

50
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,401
然后开始大笑 想想吧
and roaring with laughter.Think about it.

51

- 再见 - 祝你好运

52
00:04:19,573 --> 00:04:20,767
护士!

53
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:28,211
我不在乎他认为价值多少 就100,000不能再多
I don't care what he thinks it's worth,go to 100,000 and no more.

54
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:32,730
好的 我走过去 派辆车接我

56
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,731
Rachel的律师,她要财产转让
Rachel's lawyer.She wants a settlement.

57
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,766
- 要多少? - 我想就在这个信封里面
- How much? - I guess that's in the envelope.

58
00:05:13,093 --> 00:05:14,128
准备付吗?
Gonna pay?

59
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,603
别催我 我还没决定打开它
Don't rush me.I haven't even decided to open it yet.

60
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,931
快点 怎么了?
Come on,what's the matter?

61
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:21,765
我不知道
I don't know.

62
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:24,766
我感觉有些不对
Something just doesn't feel right.

63
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:27,572
Mickey 外面有个人在找我们 我和Ash
Mickey,there's a man outside looking for us.Me and Ash.

64
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:29,245
但是他是Harry我是Gordon
Except he's Harry and I'm Gordon.

65
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,121
- 他进来的时候告诉他们我死了 - 我正在中国
- When he comes in here,tell him I'm dead. - And I'm in China.

66
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:39,252
瞧,我不知道你在说什么,伙计 
Look,I don't know who you're talking about,mate.

67
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,325
- 你想让我相信吗? - 对不起
- Do you expect me to believe that? - I'm sorry.

68
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:48,245
打搅,你在找Harry和Gordon吗
Excuse me.You're looking for Harry and Gordon.

69
00:05:48,773 --> 00:05:52,129
我知道我来对了地方 我觉得你该告诉我一声
I knew I had the right place.I think I deserve a word with them.

70
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:53,202
对不起 但是他们
I'm sorry,but they're...

71
00:05:53,293 --> 00:05:55,284
别告诉我 在国外
Don't tell me.Out of the country.

72
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,887
Marrakesh 经营贸易
Marrakesh.For the trade fair.

73
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,488
好 当他们回来的时候 告诉他们"做得不错"
Well,when they get back,tell them "well done" from me.

74
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:04,562
他们对我做得不错 非常聪明
They did me good.Very clever.

75
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:08,487
如果他们想知道自己曾经有多聪明 这是我的名片
If they want to see how clever they've been,here's my card.

76
00:06:15,093 --> 00:06:17,402
这是你还被关在里面发生的事情
It was while you were inside.

77
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:19,924
是啊,我们厌倦了小鱼小虾
Yeah,we was bored of the small fish.

78
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:22,891
我们从这儿打个电话 一个电话
We made one call from here.One ruddy call.

79
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,771
而Naveen会得到一个详细记录的电话账单 然后他会追踪你
And Naveen gets an itemized phone bill and he traces you.

80
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,491
伙计们 这就是第一步
That's Chapter One,boys.

81
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:30,724
不 听起来不错 Mickey 是贸易,但是国际性的
No,it was sweet,Mickey.The rag trade,but international.

82
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,043
角色,剧本,让整个事情慢慢发展起来
The Rolex,the Jag.Worked the whole thing up.

83
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:34,532
我看上去像洛克菲勒
I looked like Rockefeller.

84
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:36,808
我设了个套,Naveen 
I roped in the mark,Naveen.

85
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,929
有一个T恤的工厂
Has a T-shirt factory.

86
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,521
- 你真的那么做了? - 是的
- You did that? - Yeah.

87
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:44,930
我们计划20,000,但是他想要投入50,000
We planned on 20,000,but he wanted in for 50,000.

88
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,925
如果我们知道他有麻烦,就不会去弄他了
If we'd known he was in trouble,we would have left him alone.

89
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:50,004
但是他搞得像个大人物
But he was acting the big man.

90
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:52,368
你从一个绝望的人手中骗走了钱
You took money from a desperate man.

91
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,648
这是我们做的吗?Muggers?
Is that what we are?Muggers?

92
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,164
我们以为他起码能满足温饱 
We thought he could afford to be fleeced.

93
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:59,562
我们用美好的承诺麻醉了他
We ripped him off in good faith.

94
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,203
这解释了不少我这两天的感受
This explains a lot of what I've been feeling recently.

95
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:06,564
我觉得我们最近很倒霉
I think we're under a jinx.

96
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:07,961
拜托
Come on.

97
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,009
Ash 我们为什么需要规定?
Why do we have codes,Ash?

98
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,646
因为这是一件有分寸的事情
Because it's a decent thing.

99
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:17,328
不 诈骗根本不是一件有分寸的事情
No,the decent thing is not to grift at all.

100
00:07:17,413 --> 00:07:21,452
我们有规定,因为坏举动会带来坏运气
And we have a code because bad behavior makes bad luck.

101
00:07:22,573 --> 00:07:24,450
这没有倒霉的事情,伙计
There's no jinx,mate.

102
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:26,368
切牌
Cut.

103
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,647
也许我们确实下错了套
Maybe we did pick the wrong mark.

104
00:07:56,853 --> 00:08:00,163
但是 Mickey 再一次成为局内人我感觉很好
But it felt so good to be the inside man again,Mickey.

105
00:08:00,253 --> 00:08:02,448
你知道,去感觉那种激情
You know,to feel that glow.

106
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:06,606
破产者,你几乎已经可以嗅出来了
Receivers.You can practically smell them.

107
00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,452
Rachel说我把她的一生拖下了水
Rachel says I dragged her life into the gutter.

108
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,489
我不认为这样
I don't see it that way.

109
00:08:14,173 --> 00:08:17,210
但是从一个绝望的人手中拿走他的最后一便士
But taking a desperate man for his last penny.

110
00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:22,130
你总是说我们必须依靠自己的决定生活
You always say we have to live by our decision.

111
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:25,322
那你能靠这个人生活吗?
And can you live with this one?

112
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:41,448
一个包,没别的了
One bag.And that's that.

113
00:09:12,893 --> 00:09:16,010
没什么 我是这个雕刻家的朋友
It's all right,I'm a friend of the sculptor's.

114
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,843
噢 真是令人印象深刻
Yeah.Impressive piece.

115
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,564
在那儿水滴如此令人印象深刻
Impressive use of the blobs there.

116
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:39,723
我在想是什么让他这么做
I wonder what compelled him.

117
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:45,083
我觉得如果你看过这艺术家早期的作品
I think if you look at the artist's earlier works...

118
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:46,447
这个答案会显而易见
it becomes obvious.

119
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,445
早期的作品?这个是他唯一的作品
Earlier work?This is the only one.

120
00:09:49,853 --> 00:09:51,809
他19岁就死了
He was 19 when he died.

121
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,249
我更多的是在想他儿童时期的素材
I was thinking more of his childhood stuff.

122
00:09:56,373 --> 00:10:00,286
你知道 小时候他用粉笔画的一些东西
You know,some of his early pieces that he did in crayon.

123
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,607
搞笑
Teasing.

124
00:10:04,773 --> 00:10:08,448
它值多少钱?20,000镑 不管怎么样我会考虑一下的
What's it worth?20,000.I'll think about it anyway.

125
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:14,567
Gates画廊一般都需要预约才能来参观的
Of course,the Gates Gallery is usually viewed by appointment.

126
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:18,011
- 你是她内部圈子的人吗? - 不是
- Are you one of her inner circle? - No.

127
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:22,571
我只是认为艺术是给大家看的
I just think that art is for everyone.

128
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:27,606
大家不包括穷人和一般买家...
Not when everyone includes all the poor struggling dealers and buyers...

129
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,412
- 不然她靠什么宰人 - 说的多真实啊
- that she's ripped off over the years. - How true.

130
00:10:30,493 --> 00:10:34,281
Meredith Gates喜欢和人保持一定的距离
Meredith Gates likes to keep mere mortals at a safe distance.

131
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:39,448
Dali的作品被认为以夸张的价格满足了空虚古怪的人
Dali's sketches go for inflated prices to satisfy vanity-driven eccentrics...

132
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,364
却没于真正的艺术评价
with no real art appreciation.

133
00:10:41,453 --> 00:10:45,844
至少在我付给他三分之一真正价值的时候这么说的
At least that's what I told him before I paid him a third of their real value.

134
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:50,770
我一直想写一篇关于她的文章 也许开一个博览会?
I've been hoping to write an article on her,maybe even an expos?

135
00:10:51,253 --> 00:10:52,891
看看她
Just look at her.

136
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,442
她向大众展示的唯一原因
The only reason she's opened to the proles...

137
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,889
就是她想最大限度的公开她的新蒙德里安画风
is because she wants maximum publicity for her new Mondrians.

138
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,090
- 天啊 你不是她的朋友吧? - 不是
- God,you're not a friend of hers,are you? - No.

139
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:07,921
我也是一个蒙德里安的追随者
I am after a Mondrian myself.

140
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,764
他们正在展出
They're just for show.

141
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,768
Bea Watson 艺术记者
Bea Watson,art journalist.

142
00:11:14,453 --> 00:11:16,887
Daniel Pomeroy 收藏家
Daniel Pomeroy,collector.

143
00:11:19,773 --> 00:11:22,446
你真的是蒙德里安的追随者吗?
You're not really after a Mondrian,are you?

144
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:25,001
我是说,Meredith会杀了其他人
I mean,Meredith would kill for another one.

145
00:11:25,093 --> 00:11:28,972
中间的那幅画她花了250000买的
That piece in the middle she bought for 250,000.

146
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:10,370
是的,这就是Piet Mondrian
Right.This is Piet Mondrian.

147
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,529
1872年 生于荷兰
Born in Holland,1872.

148
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:15,002
这里有一些他的油画
These are a few of his paintings.

149
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,652
很不错,但他们不会让你胡说的
Quite nice,but they don't blow your bollocks off.

150
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,123
突然 在1909年
Suddenly in 1909...

151
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,771
嬉皮士成了主流
in comes the hippy shit.

152
00:12:23,853 --> 00:12:25,764
几年之后 看这个
Few years later,this.

153
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,932
注意从后面看这个 这就是我们的利益
Pay attention at the back.This is for your benefit.

154
00:12:29,013 --> 00:12:32,130
大多数人猜想在看了毕加索的展览之后
Most people reckon that Mondrian got all fired up...

155
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:34,681
蒙德里安整个人勃然大怒...
after seeing an exhibition by Picasso...

156
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:38,368
他开始对那个让人产生幻觉的树 发表滔滔不绝的评论 
and that's when he started boshing out the psychedelic trees.

157
00:12:38,453 --> 00:12:41,411
但是 这里面有一个秘密
But there's a mystery involved.

158
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:47,684
有些人声称Mondrian在玩抽象派
Some claim that Mondrian was playing around with abstract art...

159
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,606
甚至早在毕加索之前
before Picasso even had a sniff.

160
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:53,612
因为他是一个不会装腔作势的小子
But because he was such an unassuming bloke...

161
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,092
他自己保留着那些作品
he kept it to himself...

162
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:58,802
直到毕加索之后才公众于世
and only went public after Picasso.

163
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,369
你们知道这意味着什么吗?
And do we know what that would mean,class?

164
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:06,849
蒙德里安可能发明了一种新的艺术
Mondrian could've invented a new type of art...

165
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,691
但是毕加索拿走了他所有的荣誉
but Picasso took all the glory.

166
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,291
你答得不错
Give that man an A-plus.

167
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,968
好吧,你去过一个艺术画廊也读了些书
All right,so you've been to an art gallery and read a book.

168
00:13:18,053 --> 00:13:20,692
但是这跟些有什么关系呢?
What's all this got to do with six figures?

169
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:23,412
很好 假设这个秘密已经解决了
Well,suppose the mystery was solved.

170
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:29,528
假设一幅画被发现 然后绘画的日期是1902或者1903
Supposing a painting was discovered that was dated,say,1902 or 1903...

171
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,930
- 在毕加索发明... - 立体派
- before Picasso invented... - Cubism.

172
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,288
在毕加索发明立体派之前
Before Picasso invented Cubism.

173
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:38,092
说这个画是蒙德里安的...
And say this painting was a Mondrian...

174
00:13:39,893 --> 00:13:42,805
它会改变艺术史
it would turn art history on its head.

175
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:45,766
确切的说 这就像我们给他们 蒙娜丽莎一样
Exactly.And it's not like we gotta give them the <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

176
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:48,083
我们有目标了 知道吗?Meredith Gates
We've got the mark,okay?Meredith Gates.

177
00:13:48,173 --> 00:13:50,641
我们诱饵也有了 蒙德里安
We've got the bait:Mondrian.

178
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:54,772
我们仿造一幅画 然后告诉她...
We fake the right painting,and all we gotta tell her...

179
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,966
要有多少个零写在她的支票上
is how many noughts to put on the check.

180
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:04,731
我们出去走下
Let's take a walk.

181
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,369
你听说过以伊卡洛斯吗?
Have you heard of Icarus?

182
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:17,330
当然了,邦德的反派,对吧?
'Course I have.He's a Bond villain,ain't he?

183
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:21,285
伊卡洛斯朝太阳飞的太近了然后被烧着了
Icarus flew too close to the sun and got burnt.

184
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206
很好 Mickey 像我这样的人不会引火烧身的
Well,Mickey,guys like me don't get burnt.

185
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:25,885
我们只会被晒黑
We get tanned.

186
00:14:26,093 --> 00:14:27,526
如果我们倒霉呢?
And what if we're jinxed?

187
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:29,251
你是说骗子的倒霉吗?
You talking about the grifter's jinx?

188
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:33,087
Albert被强盗报答,然后你又赚到了一个子弹
Albert getting strapped by that gangster,then you picking up an extra bullet.

189
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,528
你知道 我们不是会计师 是吧?
You know,we're not accountants,are we?

190
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:36,762
这只是该死巧合
Shit happens.

191
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:40,846
不 这是个坏的预兆 我可以感觉到 它正在我们的头上
No,it's a bad vibe.I can feel it,and it's right on our heads.

192
00:14:44,093 --> 00:14:47,085
我以前告诉过你,伙计 Lara Croft从来不会答复
I've told you before,boys,Lara Croft is never gonna reply.

193
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:51,530
不 这是一个为艺术商人和古董商的交易网站
No,this is a website for art dealers and antique buffs to swap stories.

194
00:14:51,613 --> 00:14:54,650
我正在用E-mail和我自己会谈
I'm running an e-mail conversation with meself.

195
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,527
在荷兰
In Dutch.

196
00:14:56,613 --> 00:15:00,162
那么你那两个虚构的荷兰人在谈论什么?
So what are your two fictional Dutchmen talking about?

197
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,289
Mikcey 说过不要
Mickey said no.

198
00:15:06,813 --> 00:15:11,284
我知道 我们有两个艺术商人在谈论这个新画
I know.We got two art dealers gossiping about this new painting.

199
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:14,883
一个人对另外一个人说 "留着它对你有好处"
One guy says to the other one,"Keep this to yourself."

200
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,006
那么如果它不能引起点波澜 什么都不是呢?
Now if that don't create a buzz,nothing will,will it?

201
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,653
你想把Meredith Gates引到这里来?
So you wanna draw Meredith Gates into this?

202
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:24,442
如果说有神秘的蒙德里安的新作 传到她的耳中
If word gets to her that there's this mysterious new Mondrian out there...

203
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,922
就对我们有利了
then suddenly it'll be a lot better for us.

204
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:31,325
他们以为有人在背后操纵的线索是很模糊的
Marks are so much softer when they think they're the ones doing the running.

205
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:34,644
你认为这样会说服Mikcey也参与吗?
And you think this will persuade Mickey to go along with it?

206
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,325
根本没有什么坏运气
There's no jinx.

207
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:39,291
当我们把它完成后他会发现的
When we pull this one off he'll see that.

208
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:42,168
他需要被说服
He'll need a lot of persuading.

209
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,362
我知道他会的
I know he will.

210
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,288
这就是我为什么在做这件事
<i>That's why I'm working on it.</i>

211
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:26,608

212
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,323

- Sorry to keep you waiting. - Not at all.

213
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:30,892

Hook先生,我也不知道我为什么到这里
I'm not entirely sure why I'm here,Mr.Hook.

216
00:16:37,533 --> 00:16:40,605
不要告诉我你来这里是一个错误
Don't tell me you're here under false pretenses.

217
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:43,844
- 酒来了 我随便喝了 - 当然
- There you go.I took the liberty. - Yes,you did.

218
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,366
我不能久留
I can't stay long.

219
00:16:45,453 --> 00:16:49,332
我还有个作品要交给 艺术世界 杂志 我不能让编辑焦虑
I've got a piece to deliver to <i>Art World</i> magazine and I can't upset the editor.

220
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,722
好的 让我们开门见山吧
Okay,let's cut straight to the chase.

221
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,964
Hook先生是一个国际古董商人
Mr.Hook is an international antiques dealer.

222
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:58,648
他最近得到了一小幅油画
He's recently come into possession of a small oil.

223
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:00,611
什么种类的油画?
What sort of oil?

224
00:17:00,893 --> 00:17:05,125
署名是P.蒙德里安 日期是1902年
Well,it was signed by Piet Mondrian,dated 1902.

225
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:08,330
它在英特网上关于这个作品有些言论
There's a buzz about a new work on the Internet.

226
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:09,932
我能看看吗?
Can I see it?

227
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,523
你把它带过来了吗?
Do you have it here in town?

228
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:16,731
Bea 你能为我们做的就是鉴别它
What you could do for us,Bea,is authenticate it.

229
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:20,283
我们将给你独家的报道作为回报
And in return I'd give you exclusive rights.

230
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:21,767
为了什么?
To what?

231
00:17:22,253 --> 00:17:24,209
我可能要买这幅画
I may buy this painting.

232
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:27,445
它虽然不大但是极富意义
It is small but it is significant.

233
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:31,123
我的确能引起一些艺术出版商的兴趣
I certainly could interest a few gallery publications.

234
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:34,212
抱歉 我不会去描述早期的蒙德里安
But I'm sorry,I wouldn't describe an early Mondrian...

235
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,205
以及它对全世界的意义
as all that significant to the wider world.

236
00:17:37,773 --> 00:17:38,808
我必须走了
I have to go.

237
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:41,691
我也是 把我们这次谈话忘记吧
So do I.Forget we had this meeting.

238
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:46,568
没什么事情了 抱歉浪费你宝贵的时间了
There's no story here.I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

239
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:50,573
你什么意思?这里面没有文章?
What do you mean,there's no story here?

240
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,609
- 就这样 - 事实上...
- Just that. - Actually...

241
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,683
- 这里有文章 - 事实上 根本没有
- there is a story. - Actually,there isn't a story.

242
00:17:59,213 --> 00:18:01,443
它要远远超出一个正常油画的意义 是不是?
It's more than just a regular landscape,isn't it?

243
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,922
当然不是 1902年?不
Of course not.1902?No.

244
00:18:04,813 --> 00:18:07,805
好吧 Hook先生
All right,Mr.Hook.

245
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:10,524
如果你改变了主意
If you change your mind...

246
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:15,171
对不起 我必须走了
Sorry.I really have to go.

247
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:17,692
- 再见 - 再见
- Bye. - Bye-bye.

248
00:18:19,013 --> 00:18:20,241
你好
Hello.

249
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,891
你怎么知道我会出现?
How did you know I'd turn up?

250
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:27,168
因为留下了线索
Because I scented the invite.

251
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:32,368
你真的撇下这个计划离开吗?
Did you have to go and gut the whole plan like a kipper?

252
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,967
你难道没有意识到刚才发生的事情吗?
Did you not just see what happened there?

253
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:37,162
服务员
Waiter.

254
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,450
在她认为我不感兴趣之前她不会感兴趣的
She wasn't interested until she thought that I wasn't interested.

255
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,444
现在 她有兴趣了
Now she's intrigued.

256
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,407
对不起 我们不能喝这个,它发酸了
Sorry,we can't drink this.It's sour.

257
00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:57,324
记住 Tip Jones是业界最好的伪造者
Remember,Tip Jones is the best forger in the business...

258
00:18:57,413 --> 00:18:59,881
但是我不会相信他的
but I trust him about as far as I can throw a horsebox.

259
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,646
他在玩心理游戏 他会让你徒劳无获
He plays mind games.He'll have you chasing your own tail.

260
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,201
他总想办法骗你
He's got a brain like a steel trap.

261
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,732
好了
There we go.

262
00:19:15,213 --> 00:19:19,365
你听说过人们对麻醉剂的反映总是这么糟糕,是吧?
Well,you hear about people reacting badly to anesthetic,don't you?

263
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,886
疝气
Hernia op.

264
00:19:22,053 --> 00:19:23,566
真是悲惨
Bloody tragic.

我是Mickey Stone
I'm Mickey Stone.

266
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:33,889
- 我们走吧 - 等下
- We're out of here. - Wait.

267
00:19:34,933 --> 00:19:36,207
干什么?
What for?

268
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:40,283
如果我们再呆一会儿的话 他会开始唱"我是个小茶壶..."
If we stay any longer,he's gonna sing <i>I'm a Little Teapot...</i>

269
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:42,682
然后他会挥动他的手
and he's gonna poop in his hand.

270
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,325
Tip 表演结束了
The show is over,Tip.

271
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:47,688
我们要做笔大买卖
We're here on serious business.

272
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:52,530
如果你做得好的话 你会得到10万镑
If you do this job right,you're in for 100,000.

273
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,086
停止玩这恶心的游戏
So stop playing silly buggers.

274
00:19:56,253 --> 00:19:58,528
15万,要不就走人
150,000.Take it or leave it.

275
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,803
这个是维纳斯的
...belonged to the <i>Venus de Milo.</i>

276
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:08,088
下周就去德州
Going out to Texas next week.

277
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:11,768
这个画廊的拥有者想让我 得到伪造的罪名
So this gallery owner's trying to get me on a forgery rap.

278
00:20:11,853 --> 00:20:13,571
伪造罪?<i>Moi?</i>
Forgery?<i>Moi?</i>

279
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,962
我从不伪造 我克隆
I don't forge,I clone.

280
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:19,525
不管怎么样 如果我不能站起来的话 那就没有审讯了
Anyhow,the whole trial's redundant if I can't stand.

281
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:21,444
因此要表演一下
Hence the performance.

282
00:20:22,493 --> 00:20:25,371
那你认为蒙德里安的故事怎么样?
So what do you think of this Mondrian scam?

283
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,804
Picasso之前 真是聪明
Pre-Picasso.Very cute.

284
00:20:28,453 --> 00:20:31,729
自然 三个臭皮匠 你不可能愚弄Saatchi的宠物沙鼠
Total cobblers,of course.You wouldn't fool Saatchi's pet gerbil.

285
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,963
但是我认为你很厉害
But I thought you were good.

286
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,770
伪造品通常卖给那些富有的傻瓜
Forgeries are generally sold to wealthy idiots.

287
00:20:37,893 --> 00:20:40,612
电影明星 日本渔民 
Movie stars,Japanese fishing barons who never bother...

288
00:20:40,693 --> 00:20:42,012
那些人从来不会为付账烦恼
to get them checked out.

289
00:20:42,093 --> 00:20:45,165
但是你想用一个假冒的蒙德里安的作品去欺骗Meredith Gates
You want to flog a fake Mondrian to Meredith Gates...

290
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,687
一个蒙德里安作品主要的收集者
a leading Mondrian collector.

291
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:50,003
好的 你要什么?
Okay.What do you need?

292
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:54,447
一打意大利马毛刷子 大小是4-9号
A dozen Italian horsehair brushes,sizes <i>4</i> to 9.

293
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:57,287
有一定时间的再造帆布
Reconstituted canvas circa the period.

294
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,251
它能让我们在碳同位素测年法中达到 我们想要的时期
Not that that will get us around the carbon-dating.

295
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:02,490
是的 还要个原作
Yes,and an original.

296
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:04,370
得了吧 我们可以给你个出版物
Come on.We can get you a print.

297
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:06,409
我可以从书里面看到
I got pictures in books.

298
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,969
我需要去闻 去抚摸 去体验
I need to smell,caress,taste.

299
00:21:10,253 --> 00:21:13,051
我需要一个真的蒙德里安在我身边
I need a real Mondrian sitting beside me.

300
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:17,448
毕竟 你们在说创造一副新画
After all,you're talking about originating a new piece.

301
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:19,882
这必须达到天衣无缝
This has to be perfect.

302
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:10,406
拿着它 冷静点
<i>Hold on.Calm down.</i>

303
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,892
麻烦一下 你能拿着它吧?
Can you hold on to that,please?

304
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:14,533
- 坐这儿 - 真是个混乱的地方
- Sit there. - That was a shambles.

305
00:22:14,813 --> 00:22:17,327
把Gates小姐叫来 我要马上和她说话
Now get me Miss Gates.I need to speak with her at once.

306
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,290
什么?她在布里斯托尔
What?She's in Bristol.

307
00:22:19,373 --> 00:22:21,489
那好,给她打电话
Well,get her on the phone.

308
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:26,043
一个人走进你的画廊然后从墙上拿起了你价值不菲的画
A man walks into your gallery and lifts a valuable painting off the wall.

309
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,772
为什么它没有被拴上?你们的激光保护呢?
Why wasn't it bolted down?Where's your laser protection?

310
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,889
据我所知花园都比你们的安全措施要好
I've seen garden centers with better security.

311
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,965
- 那儿有摄像机... - 如果停电怎么办?
- There's the cameras... - What's the downtime on the Mondrians?

312
00:22:34,053 --> 00:22:36,851
这些画肯定是目标 怎么样 30秒钟?
Those paintings must be out of shot for,what,30 seconds?

313
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:38,730
只要20秒 它就不见了
Only 20,as it goes.

314
00:22:40,293 --> 00:22:41,328
你是谁?
Who are you?

315
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:44,007
Debonair安全评估 就像你所意识到的
Debonair Security Assessments.As you may be aware...

316
00:22:44,093 --> 00:22:47,085
最近有一些盗贼对于伦敦的画廊有所企图
there's been some recent theft attempts on London galleries.

317
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:50,449
艺术理事会要求我们检查你们有什么措施
The Arts Council asked us to check what measures you have in place...

318
00:22:50,533 --> 00:22:51,522
为了保护这些艺术品
for insurance purposes.

319
00:22:51,613 --> 00:22:55,242
我们有X光仪器 所有的画框都被做了记号
We have the X-ray machines,and all the frames are tagged.

320
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:56,767
你们不在帆布上做记号?
You don't tag the canvases?

321
00:22:56,853 --> 00:23:00,971
不 Gates小姐的命令,没人可以去动油画
No.Miss Gates' instructions.No one tampers with the paintings.

322
00:23:01,253 --> 00:23:04,450
听着 我想我最好和Gates小姐通下电话
Look,I think I'd better call Miss Gates.

323
00:23:04,653 --> 00:23:07,213
好的 早点把她从布里斯托叫回来
Yeah,recall her from Bristol early.

324
00:23:07,733 --> 00:23:10,008
她不会生气 是吗?
She won't be annoyed,will she?

325
00:23:15,333 --> 00:23:17,528
只要告诉我一件事情
Just tell me one thing.

326
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:19,922
我们会做好的 不是吗?
We did all right,didn't we?

327
00:23:20,493 --> 00:23:24,884
绅士们 我们Debonair的评估员对你们 的合作印象很深
Gents,it is not often that a Debonair assessor is impressed...

328
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:29,047
但是 从你们那里我们 知道了 谦卑 的真正含义
but this one just learnt the meaning of the word "humility."

329
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:36,962
这个就是你要的那个时期的画布
Here's the period canvas you asked for.

330
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,601
这个给你
This is for you.

331
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:43,811
它不能被仔细地去审查 但是他起码暂时可以去替换一下
It won't pass close scrutiny but it should do the job for the swap.

332
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,963
好的 我会把原画带回来的
Good.I'll be back with the original.

333
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,766
我要一张票 
One,please.

334
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:16,407
之后将会有个小派对
Rest of my party are on the coach.

335
00:24:16,493 --> 00:24:19,724
- 派对? - 蒙德里安的欣赏团体
- Party? - Mondrian Appreciation Society.

336
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,292
好的
All right.

337
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:25,486
我不知道是否简洁的构成 抑或是他的非对称性高雅...
I don't know if it's the economy of form or the elegance of his asymmetry...

338
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:29,009
他让我十分动心 是不是有点疯狂?
but he sets me alight.Is that crazy?

339
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,282
这是什么?
What's this?

340
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,682
这个是来访的纪录 如果你喜欢的话 可以签上名字
That is the visitors' record.Sign it,if you like.

341
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,207
那我马上我签了它
I'll sign it.I'll sign right now.

342
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:54,932
这个给你 免费的
To you,free.

343
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,365
谢谢 你人真不错
Thank you.That is so kind of you.

344
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:16,086
我们一直看护这些蒙德里安
We handle these Mondrians all the time.

345
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,488
这个是办公室的又一天 真的
It's another day at the office,really.

346
00:25:22,573 --> 00:25:23,801
别说了
Stop it.

347
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,131
我喜欢那个疯狂的荷兰新塑料家
I like that crazy Dutch Neo-Plasticist.

348
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:33,451
<i>你说的对</i>
<i>You're right.</i>

349
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,888
他们有点晚了 你认为呢?
They're kind of late,don't you think?

350
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,892
- 厕所在哪里?我想小个便 - 这边请
- Where are the loos?I'm peeing my pants. - Right this way.

351
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:43,885
- 在你后面 一直走 - 谢谢你
- Behind you.Straight through. - Thanks.

352
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:26,961
再见
See you.

353
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:33,412
等下 你要去哪儿?
Wait.Where are you off to?

354
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,372
什么意思?
What do you mean?

355
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:38,250
你的小派对怎么样了?
What about your coach party?

356
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:41,411
将不一样了
Wouldn't be the same.

357
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,166
我更喜欢一对一
I like things a little more one-to-one.

358
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:48,404
知道我的意思了吗?再见
Know what I mean?Bye.

359
00:26:53,053 --> 00:26:56,966
为了以后考虑 像这样运输 是个不错的点子
For future reference,it's a good idea when transporting a painting like this...

360
00:26:57,053 --> 00:27:00,523
用个棉布包 没有研磨的
to use a muslin bag.Non-abrasive.

361
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:05,805
你要帮我重新布置这个地方 桌子在那儿 椅子排成一行
You gotta help me rearrange this place.Tables there.Chairs in a row.

362
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:08,327
蒙德里安喜欢秩序感 我也必须这样
Mondrian believed in order.So must I.

363
00:27:08,413 --> 00:27:10,563
真的要这么做吗?艺术
It really does it for you,doesn't it?Art.

364
00:27:10,653 --> 00:27:12,052
不是为你做吗?
Doesn't it for you?

365
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:14,169
听着 伙伴 我母亲有一幅画
Listen,mate.My mum had a painting.

366
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:16,289
叫 星期天的邮件
Got it out of <i>The Mail on Sunday.</i> Massive.

367
00:27:16,373 --> 00:27:19,524
- 一群狗在玩斯诺克 - 刷子呢?
- A lot of dogs playing snooker. - Brushes?

368
00:27:20,813 --> 00:27:24,283
- 这些应该浸泡在过醋 - 已经泡过了
- These need to be distressed in vinegar. - Already done.

369
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:28,492
这就是你要的颜料 高铅含量的
And here are the oils you asked for.High lead content as requested.

370
00:27:28,573 --> 00:27:31,212
去掉净重 每管的厂家都不同
Got them off the Net.Different suppliers for each tube.

371
00:27:31,293 --> 00:27:34,649
你要五罐沙丁鱼 为什么?
You asked for five tins of pilchards.Why?

372
00:27:36,453 --> 00:27:40,287
这是沙滩的场景 所以我去了回布赖顿
It's a beach scene,so I took a trip to Brighton.

373
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,168
这是你要的海水
Here's your pot of seawater.

374
00:27:43,253 --> 00:27:46,609
还有这个 我想他会在沙滩上绘画 
And here,I thought if he was painting on a beach...

375
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:51,290
在画布上面应该会有沙砾进去
the sand would have gotten caught on the sticky canvas.

376
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:54,324
11天完成
In 11 days...

377
00:27:54,413 --> 00:27:58,247
你们将拥有一副 蒙德里安的1902年的原画
an original Mondrian from 1902 will be in your possession.

378
00:27:59,253 --> 00:28:02,848
它会 在短期之内 愚弄世界上最好的专家
It will,for a brief time,fool the greatest art experts in the world...

379
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:06,562
它同时也会废除毕加索 现代艺术之父的美称
and it will dethrone Picasso as the father of modern art.

380
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:12,168
或者它应该现在就停止 否则我们会去监狱呆上几年
Or it will be spotted immediately and we'll all go to prison for several years.

381
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:48,802
- 我可以拿走这包火柴吗? - 当然可以
- May I take these matches? - Yeah,sure.

382
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,610
嗨 对不起
Hi.Sorry.

383
00:28:58,853 --> 00:28:59,922
我很高兴你打电话给我
I'm so glad you called.

384
00:29:00,013 --> 00:29:02,208
对于那天的事情我深感抱歉 我有点草率
I'm sorry about the other day.I was a bit hasty.

385
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:03,806
你不要太介意
You can't be too careful.

386
00:29:03,893 --> 00:29:07,124
告诉我 这幅画在Amersfoort找到的吗?
Tell me,was this piece uncovered in Amersfoort?

387
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,764
让我们先喝点东西吧
Let's get some drinks.

388
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:14,168
不是吧 Amersfoort
Come on.Amersfoort.

389
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:18,451
<i>劳驾 我能来电酸果蔓汁吗?一杯Sea Breeze给这位女士</i>
<i>Excuse me.Could I have a cranberry juice and a Sea Breeze for the lady?</i>

390
00:29:19,373 --> 00:29:22,126
一个荷兰的中部城市 蒙德里安的出生地
A town in central Holland,Mondrian's birthplace.

391
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,852
对 如果还没公开的话就太好了
Yes,it would have been nice if it had been uncovered...

392
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:27,083
在蒙德里安的家乡 但是呢 并没有
in Mondrian's hometown.But alas,not.

393
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,606
你有照片吗?
Do you have a photo?

394
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:30,331
我身上什么都不带
No,I carry nothing with me.

395
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:33,371
但是我不想因为这一个发现 而感受太多爆炸性的意义
But I cannot stress the explosive significance of this find.

396
00:29:33,453 --> 00:29:35,489
可我一直在想这一点呢
But I've been thinking about that.

397
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:39,168
它是不是来自西班牙的探险?
Could this be a piece from the Spanish expedition?

398
00:29:42,693 --> 00:29:44,445
你为什么这么说?
Why do you say that?

399
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:46,969
拖住她 我们正在查找
Hang fire.We're on to it.

400
00:29:47,213 --> 00:29:48,407
Albert
Albert.

401
00:29:49,213 --> 00:29:52,649
1921年伟大的西班牙展览会
The Great Spanish Exhibition of 1921.

402
00:29:53,853 --> 00:29:57,163
1921年伟大的西班牙展览会
The Great Spanish Exhibition of 1921.

403
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:01,085
不,我在谈论蒙德里安的西班牙之行
No,I'm talking about Mondrian's trip to Spain.

404
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,807
- 当然 - 探险
- Of course. - Expedition.

405
00:30:06,453 --> 00:30:08,762
我多糟糕的耳朵啊
What a deaf cretin.

406
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,042
快点 他就像个柠檬似的在那里
Hurry up.He's sitting there like a lemon.

407
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,361
坚持住
Hold on.

408
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,447
Hook先生 你让我摇摆不定
Mr.Hook,you're leaving me dangling.

409
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:23,008
你认为这幅画被蒙德里安和他最好的朋友Simon Maris
You think that this piece heralds from the trip Mondrian took to Spain...

410
00:30:23,093 --> 00:30:26,290
在1901年带去了西班牙
with his best friend Simon Maris in 1901.

411
00:30:26,973 --> 00:30:28,850
据你所知 没有记录
"As you know,no writing..."

412
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:31,049
或者画从那次旅行中留下
...or painting remains from that trip.

413
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:33,966
可能 但是 他或许见过了毕加索
"Possible,though,that he might have met Picasso."

414
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,924
你认为他可能在那见过了毕加索吗?
Do you think he may have met Picasso out there?

415
00:30:38,813 --> 00:30:39,802
我知道
I knew it!

416
00:30:39,893 --> 00:30:43,408
你在揭示在立体主义前面一个抽象的蒙德里安
You've uncovered an abstract Mondrian that predates Cubism.

417
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:46,805
我有一小幅画 它需要确认
I have a small painting that needs verification.

418
00:30:48,693 --> 00:30:51,685
我希望一个专业的记者来帮助我
I would like an expert journalist on hand to assist.

419
00:30:51,773 --> 00:30:53,684
整个世界将不得不深信不疑
The wider world will have to be convinced.

420
00:30:53,773 --> 00:30:56,765
它将会这样 我能独家报道
And they will be.In an exclusive.

421
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:02,087
为什么是我?
Why me?

422
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,404
为什么找我这样的初出茅庐的人来写?
Why pick a fledgling writer?

423
00:31:05,493 --> 00:31:07,211
你不是一个愤世嫉俗的人
You're not a cynic.

424
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,646
你一直很努力
You have no axe to grind.

425
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:12,965
你使我公开这个冒险
And you strike me as being open to adventure.

426
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:19,170
你需要等待 等到你能看到或者摸到它的时候
<i>Just you wait.You wait until you can see it and touch it.</i>

427
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:21,730
- <i>什么时候?</i> - <i>很快</i>
<i>- When? - Very soon.</i>

428
00:31:27,373 --> 00:31:29,568
你真的相信我吗?
You do believe me,don't you?

429
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,321
事实上 是的
Actually,I do.

430
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,069
没人会比他更出色
Nobody does it better.

431
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:40,165
- 他这点让我感到沮丧 - 是的
- Makes me feel sad for the rest. - Yeah,right.

432
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:42,047
对不起 Stacie
Sorry,Stacie.

433
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:47,284
你早就知道Meredith Gates的兴趣了吧?
You already knew about Meredith Gates' interest,didn't you?

434
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:48,522
我有吗?
Did I?

435
00:31:49,653 --> 00:31:51,371
我知道Pomeroy先生一直想买它
I know Mr.Pomeroy is keen to buy it.

436
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,923
他将今天去拜访Gates小姐 现在 事实上 他告诉我的
He's seeing Miss Gates today.Now,in fact.He told me.

437
00:31:55,253 --> 00:31:57,813
是啊 他或许在找一个买卖的合伙人
Well,he may be looking for a buying partner.

438
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:01,007
他正在与一个蝎子作舞伴
He's dancing with a scorpion there.

439
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,246
我必须走了
I have to go.

440
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,086
你的帐单 先生
Your bill,sir.

441
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:16,361
我的朋友 在那个桌子会买单的
My friends are picking up the tab.

442
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,402
那么你要在我回来后去看看 Meredith Gates?
So you went to see Meredith Gates behind my back?

443
00:32:22,493 --> 00:32:24,563
我想要做的就是使她上钩 你知道的
All I did was froth her up a bit,you know.

444
00:32:24,653 --> 00:32:27,611
我告诉她我要用50万来买这画
I told her I was gonna buy the painting for 500,000.

445
00:32:27,693 --> 00:32:30,571
你知道 只要压一个赌注在上面 她会激动不已
You know,just take a gamble on it.She got all agitated.

446
00:32:30,653 --> 00:32:31,881
我告诉你 Mickey
I'm telling you,Mickey...

447
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:34,282
当你准备给Meredith看这幅画的时候
when we're ready to show Meredith this painting...

448
00:32:34,373 --> 00:32:36,125
她肯定会很激动的
she's gonna be so jazzed about it...

449
00:32:36,213 --> 00:32:39,364
她最少会出价50万
she's gonna snap it up for 500,000 minimum...

450
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,368
从我眼皮底下把画买走
just to swipe it from under my nose.

451
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:44,444
看来这个意见很不错
Seems this meeting has been all for the good.

452
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,649
确是如此 
Yes,definitely.Very good.

453
00:32:47,693 --> 00:32:50,491
虽然还有一个很小的问题
There is a teensy-weensy problem,though.

454
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:54,608
Meredith认为我在西肯塔基有着一家进出口公司
Meredith thinks I run an import-export company in West Ken.

455
00:32:54,693 --> 00:32:58,368
她明天11点会带着她的决定来的
And she's coming over tomorrow at 11:00 with her decision.

456
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:04,292
早上好 我的毛茸茸的小伙伴
Good morning,my little furry friend.

457
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:11,888
老鼠
Rats.

458
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:24,407
- 早上好 Gates小姐 - 早上好
- Good morning,Miss Gates. - Morning.

459
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,246
你真决定为它支付5万?
Are you really going to pay 500,000 for it?

460
00:33:27,533 --> 00:33:29,922
我的最高价格实际上是25万
My ceiling's actually 250,000...

461
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:33,449
但是我在寻找一个能匹配我的合伙人
but I'm looking for a partner who can match me.

462
00:33:34,413 --> 00:33:38,008
你知道 如果你诚恳地话 它会值好几百万
You know,if this is genuine,it could be worth several million.

463
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:42,731
不管外貌如何 Hook先生不是一个富有的人
Despite appearances,Mr.Hook is not a wealthy man.

464
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:45,930
如果它的价值真的值几百万的话
And if it does turn out to be worth millions...

465
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:48,768
我认为他唯一权利就是从中有收获
I think it's only right that he gets a cut.

466
00:33:48,853 --> 00:33:50,764
Hook只会得到我们给他的
Mr.Hook will only get what we give him.

467
00:33:50,853 --> 00:33:53,287
如果他要更多 他可以烧掉他的50万
If he wants any more,he can burn up his 500,000...

468
00:33:53,373 --> 00:33:54,647
用在法庭上和我对峙
chasing me through the courts.

469
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:58,328
好了 我们将一起去我的画廊看下画
Right.So,we will view the painting at my gallery together.

470
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:01,644
如果我满意的话 我会考虑和你五五分
If I am satisfied,then I will consider going 50-50 with you.

471
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:04,008
Gates小姐 你真是太慷慨了
That's incredibly generous,Miss Gates.

472
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:08,443
那么你愿意安排我和Hook先生的会面吗?
So you'll arrange this meeting with Mr.Hook?

473
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:12,526
当然 我还邀请了一个记者 Bea Watson小姐
Sure.I've also invited a journalist,Bea Watson.

474
00:34:13,013 --> 00:34:16,767
我认为如果这件事是真的 我们应该扩大影响
I thought if this thing's genuine,we should bang the drum.

475
00:34:17,293 --> 00:34:19,249
除非是好的消息
Only if it's good news.

476
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:27,882
再见
Bye.

477
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:30,885
她上钩了
Yes,we're on.

478
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:35,448
我们离要的赌注还很远
We are so far from the jackpot.

479
00:34:36,653 --> 00:34:40,202
任何时候你想给我点鼓励的话 让自己放松点
Any time you wanna give me some encouragement,just feel free.

480
00:34:40,293 --> 00:34:41,487
这不是一个俱乐部 
This is not a club.

481
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:44,326
你不是在用四级诈骗赚取一个童子军的包
You're not earning a scouting badge for Grifting Grade <i>4</i>.

482
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:46,483
我们在为了大笔的钱而让某人名誉扫地
We are taking a person down for a lot of money.

483
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:48,450
我们有这么多危险要跃过去
And we have so many hoops to jump through...

484
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,047
不仅仅是一幅我们从未见过的画
not least of which is a painting we haven't seen yet...

485
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,125
由一个我们不信任的人画的 我们也成了艺术品盗贼
painted by a man we can't trust.And we are also art thieves.

486
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:56,681
- 够酷 - Danny 这一点不酷
- Cool. - It is not cool,Danny!

487
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:58,923
我们不是骗子 我们是矿工
We're not crooks.We're miners.

488
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,642
我们挖掘人们的贪婪 而且这些人都是危险的人物
We mine people's greed.And these people can be dangerous.

489
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:07,730
我想说的就是 给我们现在的构成
All I'm saying is that given our current form...

490
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:11,450
我不准备喝香槟来庆祝
I'm not about to start letting off champagne corks.

491
00:35:11,533 --> 00:35:13,683
那你不相信的话为什么去做?
Then why do it if you don't believe in it?

492
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:15,570
因为我们需要钱
Because we need the money.

493
00:35:15,653 --> 00:35:18,121
- 那你要钱干什么? - 你会明白的
- What do you need the money for? - You'll see.

494
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,771
我会喜欢吗?
Will I like it?

495
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:24,407
快点 我们有很多工作要去做
Come on,we've got a lot of work to do.

496
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:27,371
这幅画将在一个星期之内完成
The painting will be ready in just one week.

497
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,923
- 等下 我看上去怎么样? - 很不错
- All right,how am I looking? - Beautiful.

498
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,049
好的 要不 来个好运之吻?
Okay,so how about a good-luck kiss?

499
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:45,327
走吧
Let's go.

500
00:35:57,493 --> 00:35:59,324
Meredith在哪里?
Where's Meredith?

501
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:06,327
我希望你不介意我带我的教子与我一起
I hope you don't mind me bringing my godchildren along.

502
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:08,483
他们正在进行他们的6岁生日
They're on their way to a sixth birthday party.

503
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,370
主题是文艺复兴
The theme is Renaissance.

504
00:36:10,453 --> 00:36:12,250
去玩吧
Off you go and play.

505
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:15,883
他们长得真是快 不是吗?
They grow up so fast,don't they?

506
00:36:15,973 --> 00:36:18,203
厚颜无耻的小混蛋 不是吗?
Cheeky little fellows,aren't they?

507
00:36:19,813 --> 00:36:21,644
画在哪里?
Where's the painting?

508
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:26,363
Hook先生在我们谈话的时候会带来的
Mr.Hook is bringing it even as we speak.

509
00:36:32,813 --> 00:36:34,087
快点
Come on.

510
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:38,728
沙丁鱼!这跟沙丁鱼有什么关系?
Pilchards!What is this thing with pilchards?

511
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:48,168
- 喂喂 - <i>不错 你找到关键了</i>
- Hello.<i>- Good,you found the key.</i>

512
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:51,484
- 画在哪里? - <i>碗橱的顶部 银色的箱子里面 </i>
- Where's the painting?<i>- Silver case,top of the cupboard.</i>

513
00:37:20,573 --> 00:37:21,608
对不起
Excuse me.

514
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:30,563
到底发生了什么事情?
What the hell is going on?

515
00:37:35,173 --> 00:37:37,448
Pomeroy先生的助手 哦 Hook先生
Mr.Pomeroy's assistant.Oh,Mr.Hook.

516
00:37:37,933 --> 00:37:39,491
我找到了箱子 但是它被锁住了
I've got the case,but it's locked.

517
00:37:39,573 --> 00:37:41,848
没有炸药的话我没有办法打开它
There's no way to open it without a detonator.

518
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,128
没问题 稍等
That's no problem.Hang on a minute.

519
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,202
喂喂
Hello.

520
00:37:47,453 --> 00:37:49,569
我们需要打开那箱子的密码
We need a code to get into the case.

521
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:53,566
是吗?你应该为这件事高兴 我在这儿等你
Yeah?You can relax on that.I've got that right here.

522
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:55,845
- <i>发消息给我</i> - 一定会的
<i>- Text it to me.</i> - Absolutely.

523
00:37:56,013 --> 00:37:57,002
好吧
Right.

524
00:38:03,093 --> 00:38:05,049
Albert 我们快迟到了 你在哪儿?
Albert,we're running late.Where are you?

525
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:08,364
我们已经就位了 别为我们操心 好好干好你的工作吧
In position.Don't worry about us,just do your job,son.

526
00:38:08,773 --> 00:38:09,762
好的
Right.

527
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:15,727
你并没有带来那一半钱吧?
You did bring your half?

528
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:18,930
是的 夫人 25万银行的支票
Yeah,ma'am.Banker's draft for 250,000...

529
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,406
就在这里
right here.

530
00:38:22,453 --> 00:38:24,444
再给2分钟 要不我就走了
Two minutes,I'm leaving.

531
00:38:38,493 --> 00:38:41,530
好了 我要走了 过来吧 我的小天使们
That's it.I'm leaving.Come along,my cherubs.

532
00:38:42,173 --> 00:38:43,322
对不起
Sorry.

533
00:38:44,973 --> 00:38:47,692
对不起让你们久等了
Sorry to have kept you good people waiting.

534
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:49,491
交通真是很糟糕
Traffic was awful.

535
00:38:51,933 --> 00:38:53,286
是它吗?
Is this it?

536
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:58,213
- 兴奋吗? - 是的 打心眼里
- Excited? - Yes,indeed.

537
00:38:58,813 --> 00:39:02,442
这个箱子需要安全密码只有我有
This case is security-coded and I have the code...

538
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:05,001
就在我的手机里面
here on my phone.

539
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:30,886
署名蒙德里安 1902年
Signed Piet Mondrian,1902.

540
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:34,413
这是他从未使用过的风格直到
It's in a style he wasn't supposed to employ until...

541
00:39:34,493 --> 00:39:35,892
数年之后
Years later.

542
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:40,567
在画的表面上含有很多灰尘
There's quite a bit of dust embedded in the top layer.

543
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,250
画还闻起来有
Picture has a smell.

544
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:48,927
鱼 恶心 腐烂的味道
Fishy.Rank.Decay.

545
00:39:51,133 --> 00:39:53,931
有着蒙德里安后期作品的诸多特点
Bears many of the hallmarks that Mondrian used later on...

546
00:39:54,013 --> 00:39:57,164
但是有意思的是 我对这个有迟疑
but it's interesting.There's a hesitancy about it.

547
00:39:58,453 --> 00:40:02,731

所有的艺术家都尝试着一些新的 或者他害怕的事物
Almost like an artist trying something very new and scaring himself.

548
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:05,761
我的天呐
My God.

549
00:40:11,973 --> 00:40:14,043
好的 如果它不是赝品
Well,if it's not a fake...

550
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:17,164
那就是真的,我的天呐
then "My God," indeed.

551
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,487
这只是一个初步的评估 当然
This is only an initial assessment,of course...

552
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:41,929
但是它却是显现出诸多蒙德里安作品的特点
but it would appear that this work bears the traits of a Mondrian...

553
00:40:42,013 --> 00:40:44,481
在二十世纪开始的时候画的
painted at the turn of the century.

554
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:49,485
但是 这副画画在了一块质地良好的帆布上
But this picture was painted on a fine-quality canvas.

555
00:40:49,773 --> 00:40:53,652
蒙德里安不会把这么好的帆布 浪费在这样一个实验性的作品上
Mondrian wouldn't have wasted a top canvas on experimental work...

556
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,610
它明显不像是拿去卖的
that was unlikely to sell.

557
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:56,842
他或许已经搞定了
He may have done.

558
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:59,049
他是一个吝啬的而且小心翼翼的人
The man was meticulous and he was frugal.

559
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:01,044
他大多数的作品都画在纸板上面
Most of his work was done on cardboard.

560
00:41:01,133 --> 00:41:03,010
可能这是一个委托
Perhaps it was a commission.

561
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,572
一个委托?
A commission?

562
00:41:08,213 --> 00:41:11,808
当时没有人愿意花钱去买这样的东西
Nobody would have paid for something like this back then.

563
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:14,885
再怎么说 如果它是个委托的话 我们会有记录的
Anyway,if it was a commission,we'd have records.

564
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:18,761
显而易见 Hook先生 这个游戏结束了
It would seem,Mr.Hook,that the circus is over.

565
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:24,210
如果他被雇来画一些传统的东西
What if he was hired to paint something traditional...

566
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:28,605
他着手于一块好的帆布但是委托中途停止了
so he splashed out on a good canvas,but the commission fell through...

567
00:41:29,213 --> 00:41:31,010
于是他又重新利用了?
so he reused it?

568
00:41:32,213 --> 00:41:33,965
- 这块帆布 - 对 就是这样
- The canvas. - Yeah.

569
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:36,324
我喜欢听起来这样
I like the sound of that.

570
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,686
跟我来
Follow me.

571
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:46,412
如果你说的是对的话 Watson小姐 拿就应该有另一幅画
If what you say is correct,Miss Watson,then there should be another painting...

572
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,563
藏在这幅画的下面
hidden underneath here somewhere.

573
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,007
什么都没有
Nothing.

574
00:41:54,653 --> 00:41:56,530
就像我所说的 你该烧毁了它
As far as I'm concerned,you can burn it.

575
00:41:56,613 --> 00:41:59,286
等下 如果我调整下解析度
Wait.If I adjust the resolution...

576
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:06,966
一个下层图案
A pentimento!

577
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:10,732
一个隐藏在下面的风景画 看到了吗?
A hidden landscape underneath.You see?

578
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:15,326
当这个委托未能实现 蒙德里安肯定发怒了
When the commission fell through,Mondrian must have been furious.

579
00:42:15,413 --> 00:42:17,529
他用激进的手法来发泄他的怒火
He vented his frustration in something radical.

580
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:20,764
一个与众不同的海滩
A beach scene like no other,ever.

581
00:42:22,533 --> 00:42:23,886
Hook先生
Mr.Hook...

582
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:31,806
我现在就给你50万现金
I will give you 500,000 right now,in cash.

583
00:42:33,013 --> 00:42:34,969
对不起 那我的另外一半呢?
Sorry.What about my half?

584
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,805
Hook先生 现金支付
In cash,Mr.Hook.

585
00:42:36,933 --> 00:42:39,208
在拍卖会上我或许会得到5倍钱
I might get five times that at auction.

586
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,442
如果这是真的
If it's genuine.

587
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:41,727
你依然不这么认为?
You still don't think so?

588
00:42:41,813 --> 00:42:44,452
先不说画 我被说服去冒这个风险
Put it this way.I'm persuaded to take a risk.

589
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:46,967
除非我有唯一的拥有权
But only if I have sole possession.

590
00:42:47,053 --> 00:42:51,808
我有一张25万的银行支票
I've a banker's draft here for 250,000!

591
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,453
Hook先生 你愿意做这笔交易吗?
Mr.Hook,do we have a deal?

592
00:42:57,053 --> 00:42:58,566
你不该这么大胆
Don't you dare.

593
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:06,082
成交
Deal.

594
00:43:19,053 --> 00:43:20,850
我告诉你,我玩了个障眼法
I've played a blinder,I'm telling you.

595
00:43:20,933 --> 00:43:23,527
即使当Meredith发现这幅画是一个伪造品
Even when Meredith discovers it's a fake...

596
00:43:23,613 --> 00:43:25,649
她对此已经无能为力了
she's not gonna want to do anything about it.

597
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:29,203
她不可能在想让她的名字出现在所有的报纸之上
There's no way she'd want her name splashed all over the papers.

598
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,763
那么 去除小费和其他开销 我们面对的是
So,minus Tip's fee and other expenses,we're looking at...

599
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:33,888
每个人5万
50,000 each.

600
00:43:33,973 --> 00:43:37,090
那我海景别墅的目标开始变得更近了
That dream beach-house of mine is starting to look a lot closer.

601
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:40,006
我不敢相信你还拥护那些坏运气 Mickey
I can't believe you went for all that bad karma shit,Mickey.

602
00:43:40,093 --> 00:43:43,085
一个人会去创造他的好运的 伙计
A man creates his own luck in this world,son.

603
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:54,528
15万
150,000.

604
00:43:54,613 --> 00:43:58,686
谢谢给了这么多 如果你不介意的话我还想再分一部分
Ta very much,but I'll take the lot,if you don't mind.

605
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:00,322
什么?
What?

606
00:44:00,413 --> 00:44:03,689
现在我的一个朋友正在等着去打电话给警察
Right now a friend of mine is waiting to call the police.

607
00:44:03,773 --> 00:44:07,527
他们会告诉警察一副蒙德里安的画 在Gates画廊被偷窃了
They will tell the cops a Mondrian has been stolen from the Gates Gallery.

608
00:44:07,613 --> 00:44:09,569
他们会把你的名字给警察
They will give them your names.

609
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:13,009
警察会逮捕你 他们也会找到前面说到的画
The cops will arrest you.They will find said painting.

610
00:44:13,093 --> 00:44:14,685
你将去监狱
You will go to prison.

611
00:44:14,773 --> 00:44:18,652
还有 你的名字将会遍布国家的新闻媒体
And what is more,your identities will be blown by the national press.

612
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:22,009
这会使你在这个久经世故的社会中
That will make it very hard for you to pull off any more cons...

613
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,129
赢得更多的骗术
in sophisticated society.

614
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,971
但是 有一个拯救措施
But there is salvation.

615
00:44:26,053 --> 00:44:29,045
分给我那一半 这个电话将不会发生
Give me the half mil,the call is never made.

616
00:44:29,253 --> 00:44:31,403
你从不闭嘴吗 Tip?
Do you ever shut up,Tip?

617
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:34,605
你已经有这些最好的东西了
You've got all these fine things around you.

618
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:38,410
你已经叫嚣完了你的聪明的言论
You've got all your clever talk and all your yap.

619
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:42,442
但是你知道你是什么吗?你只是一个二传手
But you know what you are?You're just a tosser.

620
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:45,333
卡拉瓦乔是一个恶毒的女王
Caravaggio was a vicious queen.

621
00:44:45,413 --> 00:44:47,768
米开朗基罗追赶过小男孩
Michelangelo shagged little boys.

622
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,684
培根是一个酒鬼
Bacon was an alcoholic.

623
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:53,766
高更娶了一个13岁的小女孩 欢迎来到艺术的世界
And Gauguin married a 13-year-old girl.Welcome to the art world.

624
00:44:54,533 --> 00:44:58,890
就像你喜欢你的世界 Danny 我们就像穿着体面衣服的蟑螂
Just like your world,Danny.We are merely cockroaches with good tailors.

625
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:03,125
那么你的那位准备打电话给警察的朋友是谁 Tip?
So who is this friend of yours that's gonna call the cops then,Tip?

626
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:05,529
我觉得你不必要知道
I don't think you need to know.

627
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:06,768
放松
Easy.

628
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:12,006
你还要从Mickey身上学很多东西 他知道如何控制行为
You can learn a lot from Mickey.He knows how to behave.

629
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:13,685
我当然知道
I certainly do.

630
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,244
还要10秒钟 我认为
Ten seconds,I reckon.

631
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,972
10秒钟 会发生什么?
Ten seconds.Until what?

632
00:45:19,093 --> 00:45:20,446
我早就叫他们来了
I called them earlier...

633
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:23,650
然后我想我只是听到一辆汽车 在外面停下来
and I think I just heard a car pull up outside.

634
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:28,122
- 3,2 ,1 - 这是什么?
- 3,2,1... - What is this?

635
00:45:29,613 --> 00:45:31,683
D.S.Martins 欺诈组
D.S.Martins,Fraud Squad.

636
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,924

637
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:41,331
你记得我 是吗 Jones先生?
You remember me,don't you,Mr.Jones?

638
00:45:41,853 --> 00:45:44,526
我们有得到一个你邻居的电话
We've had a call from a neighbor.

639
00:45:44,653 --> 00:45:47,963
他说他看到你走在公园里面 Jones先生
He says he saw you walking in the park,Mr.Jones.

640
00:45:48,173 --> 00:45:51,529
现在 我们的调查在医学悬而未决范围下
Now,what with our investigation under suspension on medical grounds...

641
00:45:51,613 --> 00:45:55,128
我们觉得最好是突然拜访下然后来一个 小小的交谈
we felt it best to pop down here and have a little chat.

642
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,925
之后我们就走
We'll be off then.

643
00:45:57,373 --> 00:46:00,763
再见 Jones先生 很高兴见到你
Bye-bye,Mr.Jones.Nice to see you.

644

Lot of money here,sir.

645
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:05,809
是的 这跟我们没有关系
Yes.Nothing to do with us.

646
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:12,486
- 你知道他会反咬一口 - 我很清楚他
- You knew he was gonna turn. - I was pretty sure.

647
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:15,645
- 我们可能会少了一份钱 - 我告诉你 飞的离太阳太近
- We could have lost the lot. - I told you,flying close to the sun.

648
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:18,122
但是Tip还是可以用那画来反咬我们一口
But Tip can still turn us in with that painting.

649
00:46:18,213 --> 00:46:19,771
她在这儿干什么?
What's she doing here?

650
00:46:29,093 --> 00:46:31,926
太聪明了 还给我
Very clever.Give them back.

651
00:46:32,773 --> 00:46:35,651
Danny 她就是叫警察的人
Danny,this is the person who calls the cops...

652
00:46:35,733 --> 00:46:38,247
然后告诉他们 哪儿可以找到被盗的蒙德里安的作品
and tells them where to find a stolen Mondrian.

653
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:41,211
伪造者常常用他们的学生来 保护他们的伪造品
Forgers often use students to fence their forgeries.

654
00:46:41,293 --> 00:46:42,931

She's a grifter?

655
00:46:43,253 --> 00:46:45,847
我是个严谨的艺术专栏作家 谢谢
I'm a serious arts writer,thank you.

656
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,122
你在哪儿见到Tip的?
Where did you meet Tip?

657
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:49,249
在大学里 那儿他们一般都招新成员
At college.That's where they usually recruit.

658
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,210
在大学的每一个人都知道Tip
Everyone at college knew Tip.

659
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:54,172
当你访问他之后 Tip打电话给我
After you visited him,Tip called me...

660
00:46:55,053 --> 00:46:56,964
我们就选择这种方法
and we sort of came up with this.

661
00:46:57,053 --> 00:46:59,442
太好了 那现在发生了什么?
Great.So what happens now?

662
00:46:59,573 --> 00:47:02,451
为什么你们不拿着你们的钱
How about you keep your money...

663
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:05,130
而我拿走蒙德里安的画
and I'll hang on to the Mondrian.

664
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:08,444
不 蒙德里安的画必须要归还 这是我们做事的原则
No,the Mondrian has to go back.That's the way we work.

665
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,728
很好 但是它不是我做事的原则 
Well,it's not the way I work.

666
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:15,487
很好 如果你可以得到它的话
Well,if you can live with that...

667
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,645
那你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing here?

668
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,372
- 怎么样了 伙计们? - 还不坏
- How'd it go,boys? - Not bad.

669
00:47:36,733 --> 00:47:37,802
不会吧!你还好吗?
Don't!You all right?

670
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:41,010
别担心 是我的错误 我见到你车子后就想走快一点
Don't worry,it was my fault.I stepped out in front of you.

671
00:47:41,093 --> 00:47:42,128
我甚至没看到你
I didn't even see you.

672
00:47:42,213 --> 00:47:45,011
能不能扶我一下 我这样看上去很笨拙
Can't bend me leg.I landed awkward.

673
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:46,572
我从未遇到过这种事情
It never happened to me before.

674
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:50,407
看阿 我可以动了 别担心 美女 我很快就好
Look at that,I can move it.Don't worry,love,I'll be fine.

675
00:47:51,093 --> 00:47:53,891
这又是我们的一个漂亮的工作
Yeah,it was nice working the flop again.

676
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:57,443
那么你怎么知道她在撒谎?
So how did you know she was lying?

677
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:59,012
在鸡尾酒吧里面
At the cocktail bar.

678
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:01,932
你真的相信我 不是吗?
You do believe me,don't you?

679
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:03,890
她透露了她知道
<i>She revealed a tell.</i>

680
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:07,283
事实上 我相信
Actually,I do.

681
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,806
<i>我仔细检查了</i>
<i>I double-checked it.</i>

682
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:10,121
兴奋吗?
Excited?

683
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:13,008
<i>她的手割过自己的喉咙 一个典型的知情者</i>
<i>The throat-slash.A classic tell.</i>

684
00:48:13,093 --> 00:48:14,082
是的 打心底里
Yes,indeed.

685
00:48:14,173 --> 00:48:16,687
通常所表现的诸多于罪恶相关联的感情
<i>Usually associated with feelings of guilt.</i>

686
00:48:16,773 --> 00:48:18,843
所以你更加确定了她会出卖我们
So you double-guessed the double-cross.

687
00:48:18,933 --> 00:48:21,208
我只是想采取一些保险措施
I just took out some insurance.

688
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,772
好吧 吸取些经验
Well,take away the expenses...

689
00:48:24,893 --> 00:48:26,963
我们始终还是拿到了30万在皮箱里
we've still got over 300,000 in the pot.

690
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:30,170
20万,还有10万将有其他用处
200,000.100,000 is going somewhere else.

691
00:48:34,733 --> 00:48:35,927
哪儿?
Where?

692
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:40,965
不 不行 你不能这么做
No,no way.You can't.

693
00:48:41,053 --> 00:48:44,204
对不起 如果我们不这么做 这个人会因为我们失去一切的
I'm sorry.But if we don't,this man loses everything because of us.

694
00:48:44,293 --> 00:48:46,204
那也会给我们永久带来坏运气
And that'll jinx us forever.

695
00:48:46,293 --> 00:48:48,249
你不会相信这些这些废话吧 Ash 是吗?
You don't believe all this crap,do you,Ash?

696
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,607
我们必须去做了 Danny
We gotta do it,Danny.

697
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:51,923
- Stace? - 让他去吧 Danny
- Stace? - Let it go,Danny.

698
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,245
听着10万给Naveen做一些补偿
Look,100,000 pays Naveen back and makes amends.

699
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:57,891
我们不是盗贼 Danny
Danny,we're not thieves.

700
00:48:57,973 --> 00:48:59,326
快点 Danny
