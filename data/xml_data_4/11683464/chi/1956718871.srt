在互联网发展早期
In the early days of the Internet,

8
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,200
你是没法在线观看电影
you couldn't stream movies

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,050
或订泰餐送到家门口的
or summon Thai food to your doorstep.

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,570
但...  要是你对即将开课的物理讲座的
But... if you were interested in text-based news

11
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:21,600
相关文本新闻感兴趣的话
about upcoming physics lectures,

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,450
生活在那个时代简直棒极了
it was a great time to be alive.

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,530
我的天
Holy moly.

14
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:29,890
爸爸
Dad.

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,220
爸爸
Dad!

16
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,960
-我在洗澡  -紧急情况
- I'm in the shower! - It's an emergency.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,560
好吧  进来
Fine! Come in.

18
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,700
爸爸
Dad?

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,280
我以为你急着上厕所
I thought you had to use the bathroom.

20
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,170
这才早上7点23
It's 7:23 in the morning?

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,770
要是你不看时间表  那我打印的意义何在呢
Why do I print out schedules if you're not going to read them?

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,010
直接说你想干嘛
Tell me what you want.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,770
下周末我们要干嘛
What are we doing next weekend?

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,350
-这听起来并不像紧急情况  -就是
- This ain't sounding like an emergency. - It is.

25
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,660
史蒂芬·霍金要开讲座
Stephen Hawking is giving a lecture,

26
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,280
我一定要去
and I really need to go.

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,290
能等我洗完澡再说吗
Can we talk about this when I'm out of the shower?

28
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,290
洗快点
Pick up the pace.

29
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,160
那份你不看的时间表写了
According to the schedule that you don't read,

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,760
还有六分钟就该我洗了
I'm due in there in six minutes.

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,270
{\an9}*要说强壮我第一*
*Nobody else is stronger than I am*

32
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,060
{\an9}*昨天移山无人敌*
*Yesterday I moved a mountain*

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
{\an9}*你的英雄就是我*
*I bet I could be your hero*

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,650
{\an9}*小小身躯大智慧*

{\an8}第三季  第十六集

37
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,280
所以能去吗
So can we go?

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,440
不知道
I don't know.

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,520
去洗澡啊
Go take a shower.

40
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,370
我还有2分15秒
I still have two minutes and 15 seconds.

41
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,710
先把这事儿解决了
Let's nail this down.

42
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,490
讲座在哪儿开
Where's the lecture?

43
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,580
要是在达拉斯  那去不了
And if the answer's Dallas, we're not going.

44
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:39,130
-好消息  不是达拉斯  -那在哪儿
- Good news, it's not Dallas. - Where?

45
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,890
加州  帕萨迪纳市
Pasadena, California.

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,240
加州
California?

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,600
那比达拉斯还远得很啊
That's a lot further than Dallas.

48
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,570
直线距离为1983千米
1,232 miles further as the crow flies.

49
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,810
看来你的地理很不错啊
But kudos to you for being up on your geography.

50
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,780
我们不可能去加州的
There's no way we're going to California.

51
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,760
要是史蒂芬·霍金坐轮椅都能去
If Stephen Hawking can make it there in a wheelchair,

52
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,410
我相信我们也可以的
I'm sure we can manage.

53
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,610
谢尔顿  机票很贵的
Sheldon, airplane tickets are expensive.

54
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,050
酒店也很贵  我们没钱
Hotels are expensive. We can't afford it.

55
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,120
可是他身体很虚弱
But his health is fragile.

56
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,010
这可能是我见到他本人的唯一机会了
This might be my only chance to ever see him in person.

57
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,140
我很抱歉  伙计
I'm sorry, buddy.

58
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,050
我很想继续谈
I would like to discuss this further,

59
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,060
但我只剩...
but I only have...

60
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,720
22秒就得洗澡了  解纽扣还要花时间
22 seconds to be in the shower, and buttons slow me down.

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,970
这就是我们输球的那一刻
This is the moment we lost that game.

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,370
一次失利不意味着我们要就此放弃
But one bad play doesn't mean you give up.

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,380
明明有充足的时间扭转局势
We had plenty of time to turn it around,

64
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,360
你们却直接放弃了比赛
but y'all decided it was over.

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,400
我不想再看到你们这样
I don't want to ever see that happen again.

66
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,210
下一次  即使觉得赢不了
Next time something seems out of your reach,

67
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,760
不准放弃
you do not quit.

68
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:40,440
给我更努力
You just dig deeper.

69
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,020
是不是说  只要我找到买得起的机票
Does that mean if I find an affordable flight to California,

70
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,030
就能去加州了
we can go?

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,560
{\an8}麦德福旅行社

72
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,890
你好  有什么我能帮你的吗
Hi. Can I help you?

73
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,350
我想给我和我爸  找飞加州
I'm trying to find the cheapest flight to California

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,610
最便宜的航班
for me and my father.

75
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,490
好啊  请坐吧
Okay. Well, have a seat.

76
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,760
看来你是要去迪士尼啊
You lookin' to go to Disneyland?

77
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,760
我唯一想乘坐的过山车
The only ride I'm interested in is the intellectual roller

78
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,930
是史蒂芬·霍金驰骋的思维
coaster of Stephen Hawking's mind.

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,820
请问那在什么地方呢
And where is that located?

80
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,950
史蒂芬·霍金的脑袋里
Well... Stephen Hawking's head.

81
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,110
远在帕萨迪纳的加州理工学院
But that will be at Caltech in Pasadena.

82
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,220
明白了
Got it.

83
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,630
那你想在哪一天飞呢
And, uh, when were you looking to fly?

84
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,730
下个周末
Next weekend.

85
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,370
那没几天了啊
Oh, wow, that's pretty soon.

86
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,210
临时买机票会很贵哦
Traveling last-minute can be pricey.

87
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,160
有打折活动吗
Are there any discounts available?

88
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,300
有什么飞行常客项目的会员吗
Are you a member of any frequent-flier programs?

89
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,250
没有  从没坐过飞机
No. I've never flown before.

90
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,860
要节省机票钱可以
Well, ways to keep the cost down are:

91
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,900
在工作日飞  多次中转  或者...
flying on weekdays, multiple layovers, or...

92
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,520
或许对你不适用  不过...
This probably doesn't apply, but...

93
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,860
如果家庭中有人亡故
Airlines offer special fares

94
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,580
航空公司会提供特价机票
if there's been a death in the family.

95
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,220
有意思  可以借用下电话吗
Interesting. May I use your phone?

96
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:42,720
喂
Hello?

97
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,460
还有别的办法吗
What else you got?

98
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,660
喂
Hello?

99
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,150
再见
See ya.

100
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,370
-你要去哪儿  -和加娜出去玩
- Where you going? - Out with Jana.

101
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,840
你最近老跟她在一起啊
You've been spending a lot of time with her lately.

102
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,630
她是你女朋友吗
Is she your girlfriend?

103
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,560
爸  能让她别八卦吗
Dad, can you make her stop?

104
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,000
可以但不会  再说  我没那本事
Yeah, I could but I won't. Also, I can't.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,890
我只是想了解你的近况
I just want to know what's going on in your life.

106
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,260
要是这姑娘是你心上人的话
And if this girl is someone special to you,

107
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,860
妈妈得知道呀
then she's special to me.

108
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,740
拜托
Come on.

109
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,970
玛丽  别问了
Mary, enough.

110
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,450
干嘛  我想知道嘛
What? I want to know.

111
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,200
拜拜
Bye.

112
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,010
说一句  爸不操心你
If it helps, I don't care.

113
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,460
嗯  谢啦
It does. Thank you.

114
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,420
他为什么啥也不想告诉我
Why doesn't he tell me anything?

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,970
你青春期的时候  会跟你爸妈说这些吗
When you were a teenager, did you tell your parents stuff?

116
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,060
不会
Well, no.

117
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,710
那你凭啥指望他会
Then why do you expect him to?

118
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:22,020
因为我是一个又酷又有趣的妈妈
'Cause I'm a cool, fun mom.

119
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,870
爸  好消息  去加州的飞机票
Dad, good news. Airline tickets to California

120
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,600
比你想象中的便宜多了
are more affordable than you think.

121
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:30,960
谢尔顿  我们不去
Sheldon, we're not going.

122
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,210
怎么了
What's all this about?

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,500
斯蒂芬·霍金要在加州理工开讲座
Stephen Hawking is giving a lecture at Caltech.

124
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,940
要是我们周三出发  而且能接受在博伊西
If we leave on Wednesday and are willing to make four layovers,

125
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,340
丹佛  阿尔伯克基  法戈转机的话
in Boise, Denver, Albuquerque and Fargo,

126
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,080
我们每人只要花95块钱
we can get there for only $95 each.

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,820
我还得工作  周三不可能陪你去
I have a job... I can't just leave in the middle of the week.

128
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,500
那妈妈呢
W-Well, then what about Mom?

129
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,320
抱歉  谢利  我们没办法去
Sorry, Shelly, we're not in a position to do this.

130
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,640
可斯蒂芬·霍金是我的偶像
But Stephen Hawking's my hero.

131
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,240
这就相当于你有机会见到耶稣  或是
Imagine if you got a chance to see Jesus or...

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,030
爸能见到发明啤酒的人一样
Dad got to meet the man who invented beer.

133
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,660
看样子有人遇到难题[内裤打结]了啊
Someone's Underoos are in a knot.

134
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,980
我的内裤穿着挺舒服的  谢谢关心
My Underoos are fitting just fine, thank you.

135
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,580
那你怎么看起来坐立不安的
Then why is there a stick up your butt?

136
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,860
别再问我屁股的问题了
Stop making inquiries about my bottom.

137
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,380
我喜欢
But I enjoy it.

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,360
爸妈不同意带我去加州
Mom and Dad won't take me to California

139
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,140
听斯蒂芬·霍金的讲座
to see Stephen Hawking.

140
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,040
-你居然觉得他们会带你去加州  -是啊
- You thought they would take you to California? - Yes.

141
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,320
我要买这本书他们都不肯
They wouldn't even buy me this book at the book fair.

142
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,960
害得我只能去图书馆借
I had to get it at the library.

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,100
这书上还粘着鼻屎
There's a booger on one of the pages.

144
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,020
这次不去  我可能再也没机会见到他本人了
Well, I may never get another chance to see him in person.

145
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,680
忍着  大家一直都依你
Suck it up. You always get everything you want.

146
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,960
瞎说
That's not true.

147
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,020
你有电脑
You got a computer.

148
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,280
-我在看鼻屎书  -行吧
- I'm reading a booger book. - Fine.

149
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,020
那要怎么"忍气吞声"呢
How do you recommend I "Suck it up"?

150
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,680
不知道  不如意的时候就
I don't know, when you don't get your way,

151
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,180
闭嘴  接着过
shut up and move on.

152
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,300
-你就这么干的  -对
- Is that what you do? - Yeah.

153
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,500
知道你为什么没电脑了吧
And that's why you don't have a computer.

154
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,880
乔吉是我儿子  我有权知道
Georgie is my son... I have the right to know

155
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,780
他和谁在一块儿
who he's spending time with.

156
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,720
你说加娜
You talking about Jana?

157
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,060
你也认识她
You know her?

158
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,640
严格来说并不认识
Well, I don't really know her.

159
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,180
我在戴尔店里
I've seen them hanging out together

160
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,160
看到过他们几次
at Dale's store a couple of times.

161
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,360
挺可爱的
She's cute.

162
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,600
很好  知道的比还我多
Great. So you know even more than I do.

163
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,360
这不正常吗
Always have.

164
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,940
我没觉得我过线了啊  我就想
I don't feel I'm being out of line wanting to...

165
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,740
知道这姑娘几岁了
know how old this girl is

166
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,820
去哪个教堂  姓什么
or what church she goes to or her last name.

167
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,180
姓欧文斯
Owens.

168
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,720
干嘛  这不告诉你了吗
What? Now you know.

169
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,260
难以置信
Unbelievable!

170
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,880
拜托
Oh, geez,

171
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,860
你担心谢尔顿不正常
you worry about Sheldon not being normal,

172
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,960
现在又担心乔吉太正常
now you're worried about Georgie being normal...

173
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,020
我怎么养出你这个二愣子
How did I raise such a turd?

174
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,960
我才不是  那啥
I am not...that word.

175
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,940
如果你都说不出那啥
If you can't say the word,

176
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,920
你估计就是那啥了
you might be the word.

177
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,620
接下来的几天
Over the next few days,

178
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,680
我尝试了我姐的建议
I tried to take my sister's advice

179
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,140
"忍气吞声"
and "Suck it up."

180
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,360
但怎么可能
But how could I,

181
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,440
所有一切都让我联想到史蒂芬·霍金
when everything reminded me of Stephen Hawking?

182
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,720
x-u-é  学
L-e-a-r-n.

183
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,760
正确  现在拼
That is correct. Now spell...

184
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,800
天哪
Oh, dear!

185
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,160
这其实是女士洗发水
It's actually a shampoo for ladies,

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,420
但我的秀发天生适用
but my hair just responds to it.

187
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,500
你周五晚上有空吗
So, what are you doing Friday night?

188
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,420
有空
No plans.

189
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,800
我爸妈正好不在家
My parents are gonna be out of town.

190
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,820
真的吗
Really?

191
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,000
想过来吗
Wanna come over?

192
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
你家人不在的话  我爸妈不会允许的
My parents won't let me if your folks ain't there.

193
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,700
好吧
Okay.

194
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,780
但我可以不告诉他们
Uh, but I guess I don't have to tell 'em.

195
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,580
行
Cool.

196
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,120
好  下课
Okay, that's it.

197
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,880
什么都没法帮我摆脱郁闷
Nothing was able to shake me from my doldrums,

198
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,320
连斯特奇斯博士炫酷的新毛绒背心也不行
not even Dr. Sturgis's jaunty new sweater-vest.

199
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,420
谢尔顿
Sheldon?

200
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,840
嗯
Yes?

201
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,960
看你心不在焉啊
You seem distracted.

202
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,700
我真的很想去加州理工  看史蒂芬·霍金的讲座
I really wanted to see Stephen Hawking speak at Caltech,

203
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,020
但我爸妈没钱去
but my parents can't afford the trip.

204
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,640
太可惜了
That's too bad.

205
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,260
霍金博士的讲座特别精彩
Dr. H puts on a heck of a show.

206
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,080
我想是的
I believe it.

207
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,620
知道我这毛绒背心两面穿的
Would it make you feel better to know

208
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,900
会不会让你开心一点
this vest is reversible?

209
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,440
一点点吧  谢谢
A little. Thanks.

210
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,180
等等
Wait.

211
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,900
我也许能帮你去
I may be able to help you with Hawking.

212
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,220
真的吗
Really?

213
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,800
充满惊喜的可不止我这毛绒背心哦
This vest is not the only thing that's full of surprises.

214
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,740
你要去哪儿
Where ya goin'?

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,720
出去
Out.

216
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,200
去哪
Out where?

217
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,660
加娜家
Jana's.

218
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
她父母在家吗
Her parents gonna be there?

219
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,240
-是的  -好
- Yep. - Okay.

220
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,020
我打电话确认一下
Let me just call and make sure.

221
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,620
欧文斯
Owens.

222
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,620
那是她的姓吧  欧文斯
That's her last name, right? Owens?

223
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,380
你怎么这么奇怪
Why are you being so weird?

224
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,800
我没有很奇怪啊  你奇怪吗
I'm not being weird. Are you?

225
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,520
-我不啊  -很好
- No. - Good.

226
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,080
没人奇怪
No one's being weird.

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,900
别打
Don't call 'em.

228
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,900
为什么
Why not?

229
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,720
你怎么就不相信我呢
Why can't you just trust me?

230
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,200
因为我知道你在撒谎
Because I know that you're lying.

231
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,060
啥  我没有
What? No, I'm not.

232
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,300
我听到你跟加娜通的电话了
I heard you on the phone with Jana.

233
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,120
你监视我
You spied on me?

234
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,060
我不是有意的  但我很庆幸我听到了
I didn't mean to, but I'm glad that I did,

235
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,440
因为你当着我的面撒谎了
because you just lied to my face.

236
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,100
你哪儿也别想去
You are not going anywhere.

237
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,180
倒是拦我啊
Try and stop me.

238
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,280
你走出那扇门一步我就叫你爸来
You walk out that door, and your father gets involved.

239
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,820
我受不了了
I don't need this.

240
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,460
见鬼
Dang.

241
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,120
爸
Dad.

242
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,020
-你错过了一场好戏  -发生了什么
- You missed everything. - What happened?

243
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,400
乔吉要去跟加娜独处  对妈妈撒了谎
Georgie lied to Mom to be alone at Jana's house,

244
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,740
妈知道他撒谎了  因为她偷听了他俩通话
but Mom knew 'cause she listened in on his phone call.

245
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,800
天啊
Oh, boy.

246
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,840
现在乔吉被禁足了  大家都很不爽
Now he's grounded and everyone's mad.

247
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,720
我例外  我非常开心
Not me. I'm super happy.

248
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,660
行吧  拜拜
Well... bye.

249
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,820
爸  学校出钱让我们去加州
Dad, the university offered to pay for us to go to California!

250
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,820
他们还给我们订了酒店
They're even putting us up in a hotel.

251
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,060
真的吗
You're kidding.

252
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,540
我们要去加州了
We're going to California?

253
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,940
不  就我和爸爸去
No, just me and Dad.

254
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,000
真公平呢
That's fair.

255
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,740
我真为你高兴
I'm so happy for you.

256
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,520
有时候讽刺的话会很明显
Sometimes sarcasm was laid on so thick

257
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,980
就连我都感觉得到
even I could detect it.

258
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:17,900
谢谢
Thanks!

259
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,980
但这一次我没感觉到
This was not one of those times.

260
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,260
好吧  不  这很说得通
I see. Well, no, that makes sense.

261
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,740
好的  约翰  谢谢
Okay, John, thanks.

262
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,120
再见
Bye.

263
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,660
谢尔顿是对的
Sheldon was right.

264
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,640
他们会支付旅程的所有开销
They're offerin' to pay for the whole trip.

265
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,720
为什么
Why?

266
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,780
斯特奇斯跟他上司谈了
Sturgis talked to his boss, and

267
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,180
他们真的很想招谢尔顿进学校
they really want to keep Sheldon goin' to school there.

268
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,700
我应该可以带他去
I guess I could take him.

269
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,800
为什么是你带他  他先问的我
Why you? He asked me first.

270
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,380
我现在很生乔吉的气
I'm mad at Georgie right now.

271
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,540
我们最好保持点距离
It'd be good for us to have some space.

272
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,240
所以  你和乔吉吵架
So, you pick a fight with Georgie,

273
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,940
就不让我去加州
and I don't get to go to California?

274
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,540
行吧  你去
Fine, you can go.

275
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,940
多谢
Thank you.

276
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,260
换个时区安排谢尔顿的如厕时间表
Have fun managing Sheldon's bathroom schedule

277
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,520
一定会很有趣
in different time zones.

278
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,880
我来给我们家要远行的大宝贝们拍个合影
Let me get a picture of my boys before their big trip.

279
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,380
做好记录是明智之举
It's smart to document this.

280
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,400
等你下次再见到我  我就是跟
Next time you see me, I'll have been in the presence

281
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,860
斯蒂芬·霍金见过面的人了
of Stephen Hawking.

282
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,360
笑一笑
Smile.

283
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,240
我觉得应该严肃一点
I'd prefer to look serious.

284
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,380
这照片可能有一天会印在课本上
This may appear in a textbook someday.

285
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
说"斯蒂芬·霍金"
Say, "Stephen Hawking."

286
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,920
-斯蒂芬·霍金  -斯蒂芬·霍金
- Stephen Hawking. - Stephen Hawking.

287
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,180
讨厌啦  你害我笑了
Aw, you made me smile.

288
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,160
洗手吃饭了
Wash up for dinner.

289
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,360
我不吃
I ain't eatin'.

290
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,440
那你也不能看电视了
Well, you're not watchin' TV.

291
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,140
不让我出门  现在连电视也不让我看了
I can't leave the house, and now I can't watch TV.

292
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,620
没错  因为你在关禁闭
Yeah, it's called being grounded.

293
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,000
真等不及要搬出去了
I can't wait to move out.

294
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,080
你说啥
What was that?!

295
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,940
下次我在电话上说
Next time, I'll say it on the phone,

296
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,080
你就能听清了
so you can hear me.

297
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,380
再这么皱眉头就要长皱纹了啊
You keep frownin' like that, you're gonna get wrinkles

298
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,560
跟你姥姥我似的
like your meemaw.

299
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,460
你挺美的啊
You look great.

300
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,700
我知道  我就是想听你说出来
I know, I just wanted to hear you say it.

301
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,200
你想什么呢
What's on your mind?

302
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,760
谢尔顿总是想要什么就有什么
Sheldon always gets everything he wants.

303
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,760
应该是吧
I guess he does.

304
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,240
是不太公平哈
That's not fair, huh?

305
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,300
可不是嘛
No!

306
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,160
不过话说回来  他只是
On the other hand, he's just

307
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,920
去听个科学讲座
going to some science lecture.

308
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,840
我知道  但是他就能坐飞机去加州
I know, but he gets to go on a plane to California.

309
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,220
坐飞机也没那么好
Planes aren't all that great.

310
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,460
飞机上都不让抽个烟
You can't even smoke on 'em anymore.

311
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,840
我跟你说啊
I tell you what,

312
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,060
你今天训练结束以后
after practice today,

313
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,140
咱们俩去找点乐子
you and me will do somethin' fun.

314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,040
我能抽烟吗
Can I have my first cigarette?

315
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,140
不行
No!

316
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,940
那我能打耳洞吗
Can I get my ears pierced?

317
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,480
你妈妈不会喜欢的
Your mom won't like that.

318
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,560
所以  没准可以哦
So, maybe.

319
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,040
好嘞  34排AB座  咱们到了
All right, 34A and B... This is us.

320
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,800
你想靠过道还是靠窗
All right, you want the aisle or the window?

321
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,380
哪个是分配给我的
Which one is assigned to me?

322
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,920
都行  你随便选一个坐
It doesn't matter, just pick one.

323
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,980
如果靠窗坐  我就能看到起飞和降落
Well, if I sit by the window, I can watch the takeoff and landing,

324
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,340
如果靠过道坐
but if I sit on the aisle,

325
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,780
我就离厕所近一点
I'm closer to the bathroom.

326
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,620
又来了
Here we go.

327
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,260
如果靠窗的话  我上厕所的时候
Although if I'm by the window, you'll have

328
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,040
你就得起身让我出去
to get up when I use the bathroom.

329
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,620
反过来  你上厕所的时候
But if I'm not, I'll have

330
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,440
我就得站起来
to get up when you use the bathroom.

331
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,340
就随便选一个吧
Just pick one.

332
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,820
太难选了
It's a tricky decision.

333
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,240
我的膀胱比你的小...
My bladder's smaller than yours...

334
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,920
有什么问题吗
Everything okay here?

335
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,940
马上就好  来
About to be. Here!

336
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,740
靠过道坐
Aisle it is!

337
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,840
我们好了
We're good.

338
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,940
好的
Oh, okay.

339
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,940
能帮我一下吗
You want to help me with this?

340
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,720
不能
No.

341
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,700
是你对我撒谎了
You're the one who lied to me.

342
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,680
我不打算再跟你讲话  所以不会再对你撒谎了
Well, I'm done talkin' to you, so it'll never happen again.

343
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,620
怎么了
What?

344
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,330
我知道你不想跟我讲话  没关系
I know you don't want to talk, and that's fine.

345
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,680
你听我说就行了
You can just listen.

346
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,700
就算你做出正确的决定  生活就已经够难的了
Life is hard enough if you make good decisions,

347
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,220
但如果你做出错误的决定  生活只会难上加难
but if you make bad ones, it gets even harder.

348
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,390
我跟加娜根本就不会发生什么
Nothin' was gonna happen with Jana.

349
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,350
-乔治  -别说了
- Georgie... - No!

350
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,150
你总是把我往最坏的方面设想
You always assume the worst with me.

351
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,250
很抱歉你以前是个好孩子  而我就是个烂摊子
I'm sorry you were a perfect kid and I'm just a screwup.

352
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,380
你不是个烂摊子
You are not a screwup.

353
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,410
我也不是个好孩子
And I was not a perfect kid.

354
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,510
那你做过什么  某天早上做礼拜的时候睡着了
Oh, what'd you do, sleep through church one mornin'?

355
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,520
那我告诉你
For your information...

356
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,470
我曾逃过课
I used to skip class...

357
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,010
就为了
so that I could

358
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,020
去我男朋友的卡车里喝酒
drink beer in my boyfriend's truck.

359
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,300
老爸那时还有辆卡车
Dad had a truck back then?

360
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,660
说的不是你爸
Not talkin' about your dad.

361
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,460
我还...
I also...

362
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,010
偷开过你外婆的车
stole your meemaw's car

363
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,500
结果撞到沟里去了
and crashed it into a ditch.

364
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,280
是吗
Really?

365
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,790
和那个不是老爸的男朋友一起吗
With that boyfriend who wasn't Dad?

366
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,870
-这不是重点  -如果重点是
- Missin' the point! - If the point is

367
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,990
你做过错的决定  但现在还好好的
you made some bad decisions and turned out fine,

368
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,580
那干嘛对我这么严格
then why you being so hard on me?

369
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,310
因为有些决定你逃不开
Because some decisions you cannot walk away from

370
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,960
并且会影响你的余生
and they will affect the rest of your life.

371
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,380
如果你是在担心加娜怀孕的话
If you're talkin' about Jana getting pregnant,

372
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,630
不会的
she ain't gonna.

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,050
我当年也是这么想的  结果下一秒
That is what I thought, and the next thing I know,

374
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,310
我就站在礼堂里成为新娘了
I'm at the courthouse gettin' married.

375
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,570
你是奉子成婚的
You got married because you were pregnant?

376
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,940
是的
Yes.

377
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,690
所以我就是个错误
So, I was a mistake?

378
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,860
不不不
No! No!

379
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,180
你是上帝的恩赐
You are a blessin'.

380
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,770
我的错在于向我父母撒谎
The mistake was lyin' to my parents,

381
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,230
然后去你爸家过夜
so that I could spend the night at your dad's house.

382
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,500
接下来  就是龙舌兰的错了
And, you know, tequila.

383
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,970
女士们先生们  我是本次航班的机长
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

384
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,650
我们即将出发前往洛杉矶
We're expecting a smooth flight to Los Angeles.

385
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,120
起飞前  请集中注意力
Before we take off, please direct your attention

386
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,850
听乘务员讲解
to the flight attendants as they review

387
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,080
几点重点安全事项
some important safety procedures.

388
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,950
"安全事项"  天啊
"Safety procedures"? Oh, baby.

389
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,390
请花几秒钟找到
Take a minute to locate

390
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,180
离你最近的出口
the exit closest to you.

391
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,740
最近的出口可能就在你后面
The nearest exit could be behind you.

392
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,410
如客舱突然遭到释压
Should the cabin experience sudden pressure loss,

393
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,630
氧气面罩会自动从座椅上方脱落
oxygen masks will drop down from above your seat...

394
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,380
客舱内怎么会释压呢
Why would the cabin lose pressure?

395
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,500
-不会的  -请将氧气面罩像这样罩在口鼻处
- It won't. - Place the mask over your mouth and nose,

396
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,550
拉动绳子将其系紧
like this, pull the strap to tighten it.

397
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,930
如果您携带儿童
If you are traveling with children,

398
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,890
请确保自己先佩戴好面罩
make sure that your own mask is on first

399
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,930
再去帮您的孩子戴好
before helping your child...

400
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,410
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this at all.

401
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,280
只是打个预防针
It's just a precaution.

402
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,530
其实  安全得很
You know... perfectly safe.

403
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,590
在极少数情况下  会需要水上降落和人员撤离
In the unlikely event of a water landing and evacuation...

404
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,540
水上降落  水上降落  水上降落
Water landing, water landing, water landing...

405
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,260
我做不到
I can't do this.

406
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,090
继续讲  我们马上回来
Keep going, we'll be right back.

407
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,730
先生
Sir?!

408
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,950
-谢尔顿  出来  -不要
- Sheldon, come out of there! - No!

409
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,650
至少开开门
At least open the door.

410
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,950
告诉他们我要下飞机
Tell them I need to get off.

411
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,630
先生
Sir?

412
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,550
你们俩都得回到座位上
You both need to return to your seats.

413
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,000
稍等
Just one second.

414
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,920
先生  先生
Sir. Sir...

415
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,100
如果你想见到斯蒂芬·霍金
If you want to see Stephen Hawking,

416
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,860
我们就要马上坐好
we have to sit down right now.

417
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,940
-太危险了  我做不到  -有点害怕没事的
- It's too dangerous. I can't! - It's okay to be scared.

418
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,180
-先生  -这就是你应该勇敢面对的时刻
- Sir? - Th-That's when you got to dig deep and be brave.

419
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,400
你说呢
So, what do you say?

420
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,920
不行  我现在害怕极了
No, I'm your terrified little boy!

421
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,780
好吧
Okay.

422
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,220
先生  拜托  他们要叫警卫了
Sir, please, they're gonna call security!

423
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,820
再等一下
Just one more second.

424
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,950
斯波克先生[《星际迷航》角色]
Mr. Spock!

425
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,790
他整天坐着宇宙飞船飞来飞去
He flies around all the time in that spaceship.

426
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,140
他不害怕  对吗
He's not afraid, is he?

427
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,060
我不是斯波克先生
I'm not Mr. Spock.

428
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,410
我知道  但我见过你假扮成他
No, but-but I've seen you pretend to be him.

429
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,170
你现在能试试吗
Could you do that right now?

430
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,070
你当斯波克  我当柯克[《星际迷航》角色]
You be Spock, I'll be Kirk.

431
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,980
试试吧
Maybe.

432
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,030
好的  斯波克先生
Okay, Mr. Spock.

433
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,450
首先你要回到座位上
Your first order is to return to your seat.

434
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,490
是  柯克船长
Aye, Captain.

435
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,660
空乘人员  准备起飞
Flight attendants, prepare for takeoff.

436
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,310
没事吧  斯波克先生
You okay, Mr. Spock?

437
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,090
尽我所能  长官
Doing my best, sir.

438
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,330
船长和斯波克不牵手的
The captain and Mr. Spock don't hold hands.

439
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,570
不好意思
Sorry.

440
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,460
好吧  就牵这一次
Okay, maybe just this once.

441
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,000
{\an8}加利福尼亚理工学院

442
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,860
我觉得我们在加州的事上被骗了
I think we've been lied to about California.

443
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,450
校园里没有一个人被晒黑了
No one on this campus is tan at all.

444
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,660
是啊  一点都不黑
No, they are not.

445
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,000
想想这些桌子前
Imagine all the stimulating conversations

446
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,210
讨论多振奋人心
that must go on at these tables.

447
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,430
我赌也是
I bet.

448
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,390
我能想象有一天我也会来到这儿
I can see myself going here one day.

449
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
我想你能很好地适应的
I think you'd fit right in.
