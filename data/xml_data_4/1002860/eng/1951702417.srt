NO, THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

FOR ANOTHER ONE.

MM, WHAT'S UP?

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,900
WELL, I STOPPED BY KATHERINE'S
LAST NIGHT JUST TO GET A RECIPE,

39
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,800
AND YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHAT I OVERHEARD.

40

GOING TO KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS,

43

HAVE TO FIND BETTER LIES."

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,300
We should go, too.

51
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,400
GET A FEW DRINKS IN HER,
SEE IF SHE LOOSENS UP.

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,200
WELL, I DOUBT
A WOMAN LIKE KATHERINE

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
IS GONNA SPILL HER SECRETS

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,100
JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S HAD A LITTLE WINE.
I DON'T KNOW.

55
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,800

SOME INTERESTING THINGS

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,300

THE SAUCE.
WELL, NONE THAT I RECALL.

YOU LOST YOUR VIRGINITY

58
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,200

POINT WELL TAKEN.
I'LL BRING THE WINE.

TO BE MAKING CRIBS?

122
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,900
EARLY WOULD BE
PAINTING IT PINK OR BLUE.

123
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,700
BUT...

124
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
I GOT BOTH,
SO WE'RE COVERED EITHER WAY.

125
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,100

133
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,200

134

NO, NO????

135
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,500

137
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
I NEED A FAVOR.

138
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,600
UM, I REMEMBER YOU
MENTIONING

139
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,000
THAT YOU LIKED
YOUR OBSTETRICIAN.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,100

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE USING DR. MAYFAIR.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,500
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE WEIRD.

143
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
YOU KNOW,
ADAM IS MY NEIGHBOR.

144
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,900
BUT YOU DON'T MIND
ORSON BEING YOUR DENTIST.

145
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,600
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I DON'T BLUSH

146
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
WHEN ORSON SAYS,
"OPEN WIDE." (chuckles)

147
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,100
YOU KNOW, MY O.B.
IS ALL THE WAY ACROSS TOWN.

148
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,300
YOU JUST DO NOT WANT
TO DRIVE THAT FAR.

149
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
OH, WELL, WE COULD SCHEDULE
OUR APPOINTMENTS TOGETHER

150
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,200
AND CARPOOL.

151
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,000
YOU KNOW... (chuckles)
PREGNANT GALS ON THE ROAD.

152
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
(laughs) IT DOES SOUND FUN,

153
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
BUT I DON'T THINK MY DOCTOR'S
TAKING ON ANY NEW PATIENTS.

154
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,500
OH, I CAN TALK HIM INTO IT.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

155
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,000
I, UM...

156
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
DON'T REMEMBER.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,200
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

158
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,000
NO. YOU KNOW, I USUALLY
JUST CALL HIM "DOCTOR."

159
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,500
(laughs) BREE,
JUST GET ME THE NUMBER.

160
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,500
OOH. (laughs)

161
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
HERE YOU GO, BUT PLEASE
DON'T MENTION MY NAME.

162
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,100
AS I SAID, YOU KNOW,
HE'S OVERBOOKED,

163
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
AND I JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET ON HIS BAD SIDE.

164
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,400
I'M SO EXCITED. PREGNANT GALS
SHARING A DOCTOR! (laughs)

166
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,300
OH, BLESS YOU.
OH! SORRY,
PROBABLY JUST ALLERGIES,

167
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400

TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.

168

170
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
CAN I GET A DRINK?

171
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,300
YEAH, SURE.

172
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,100
BY THE WAY,
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

173
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,400
OH, THANKS.

174
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
ANYTIME.

175
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
I'D SAY
THE CAR IS CLEAN ENOUGH.

176
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
KATHERINE.

177
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,600
YOU TWO SEEMED AWFULLY FRIENDLY.
DO YOU KNOW HER?

178
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,900
NO. WE SAID TWO WORDS.
SHE CRITICIZED MY CAR WASHING.
HMM. IT'S FUNNY.

179
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,900
WHEN I CRITICIZE YOU, YOU DON'T
PUT ON A BIG, GOOFY GRIN.

180
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
YOU REALLY NEED
TO STOP THIS.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,400
GIVEN OUR HISTORY, SHOULDN'T I
BE SAYING THAT TO YOU?

182
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,800
KATHERINE, I CAN'T
JUST NOT SPEAK TO WOMEN.

183
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,500
I'M A GYNECOLOGIST,
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
YES, I KNOW.

185
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING
YOUR WORK HOME WITH YOU.

186
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,000
YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,300
AH, EDIE ASKED ME TO HELP HER
PICK OUT A GIFT FOR HER SISTER,

188
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,500
SO I GOTTA
SWING BY THE MALL.

189
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,200
WHEN CAN I SEE YOU NEXT?

190
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,700
WELL, VICTOR HAS
A TEACHERS' UNION THING

191
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,600
ON THURSDAY.

192
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,500
GUESS I'LL SEE YOU
ON THURSDAY.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,600
CARLOS,
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE?

194
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,500
I MEAN, WITH US. WHY ARE WE
STILL SNEAKING AROUND?

195
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,600
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHY.

196
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,800
OH, COME ON. EDIE'S RECOVERED
FROM HER LITTLE SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

197
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON?
I'VE GOT SOME THINGS GOING ON,

198
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
AND I NEED THEM TO PAY OFF
BEFORE I CAN MAKE A MOVE.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,300
REALLY,
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

200
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,900
OKAY, BUT IF YOU DID
HAVE A CHOICE,

201
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,900
WOULD IT BE A HARD ONE?

202
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,600
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH EDIE, IS IT?

203
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,100
NO, I DON'T LOVE EDIE.

204
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,600
AND I'VE GOT A PLAN TO GET HER
OUT OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

205
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,300
JUST GIVE ME TWO WEEKS, OKAY?

206
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,800
A BRACELET'S ALWAYS NICE.

207
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,600
FOR EDIE'S SISTER.

208
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
GOOD IDEA.

209
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,200
HERE'S THE THING...
MY DAUGHTER HAS CANCER.

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,400
SHE'S SO NAUSEOUS,
SHE'S STOPPED EATING,

211
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
AND I CAN'T JUST STAND BY
AND WATCH HER WASTE AWAY.

212
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,300
SO I ASKED AROUND,

213
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,400
AND PEOPLE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO GET ME WHAT I NEED.

214
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,300
YOU FOLLOW MY DRIFT?

215
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,200
UM... YEAH.

216
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,000
YOU... YOU WANT ME
TO SCORE YOU SOME WEED.

217
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,100
THE BEST STUFF YOU CAN GET.

218
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,200
NOTHING'S TOO GOOD
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,900
DARLING?
WHAT IS IT?

220
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,800
WELL,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

221
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
I-I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE CONVENT.

222
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,900
IT SEEMS DANIELLE
TOOK A LITTLE SPILL.

223
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,900
YOU'RE 81/2 MONTHS PREGNANT!

224
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,800
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME
WERE YOU DOING ROLLER-BLADING?

225
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
I'M BORED.
ALL I DO IS LAY AROUND.

226
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
IN YOUR CONDITION,
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE DOING.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,300
AND WHERE ON EARTH
DID YOU GET SKATES IN A CONVENT?

228
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,800
I BORROWED THEM FROM ONE
OF THE EATING DISORDER GIRLS.

229
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,300
THEY HAVE ALL
THE GOOD EXERCISE EQUIPMENT.

230
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,900
Danielle,

231
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,100
WHAT IF YOUR RECKLESS BEHAVIOR
HAD HURT THE BABY?

232
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,600
THEY'RE GOING TO EXAMINE ME.
I'M SURE THE BABY'S FINE.

233
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
YES, AND IT IS GOING
TO STAY THAT WAY

234
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
BECAUSE I HAVE INSTRUCTED
SISTER THERESA

235
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,600
TO KEEP YOU SEQUESTERED
IN YOUR ROOM

236
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,500
UNTIL THE BABY IS BORN.
What am I supposed to do
for fun?

237
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,400
YOU WON'T EVEN GET ME
A DVD PLAYER.

238
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,200
WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU
COULD USE THESE LAST FEW WEEKS

239
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,200
FOR REFLECTION
AND PERSONAL GROWTH.

240
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,600
(scoffs) I HATE YOU.

241
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
CLEARLY,
IT WOULD BE TIME WELL SPENT.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
HOW WAS THE LASAGNA?

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK IT YOURSELF?

244
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,400
HONEY.
SORRY.

245
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,900
AT LEAST EAT A LITTLE.

246
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,100
WE NEED YOU IN FIGHTING FORM
FOR CHARADES TONIGHT.

247
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,800
YEAH, ABOUT THAT...
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA MAKE IT.

248
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,900
YOU HAVE TO! YOU ARE
THE CHARADES ASSASSIN.

249
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,500
THEY STILL TALK ABOUT
THE NIGHT THAT YOU GUESSED

250
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,100
"THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY"
IN 15 SECONDS.

251
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,900
12.

252
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,200
AND THAT'S MY POINT.
I'M UNDEFEATED.

253
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,500
WHY SPOIL MY WINNING STREAK

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,400
BY PLAYING
WHEN I'M NOT UP TO IT?

255
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,600
HONEY, PEOPLE...
KNOW THAT YOU'RE SICK.

256
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,400
THEY DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO BE AT YOUR ABSOLUTE BEST.

257
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,000
TOM, HAIR LOSS
AND CONSTANT NAUSEA...

258
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
THOSE ARE INCONVENIENCES.

259
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,300
LOSING AT CHARADES
TO SUSAN MEYER...

260
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,800
THAT IS JUST
FLAT-OUT INTOLERABLE.

261
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,000
HEY, ANDREW.
HEY.

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,900
WHAT'S UP?
HEY, MR. SCAVO, UM,

263
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,000
A PACKAGE FOR LYNETTE'S MOM
GOT DELIVERED TO OUR HOUSE

264
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
BY MISTAKE, SO...
OH! I'M COMING.
I'VE GOT IT, TOM.

265
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,300
IT'S A PATTERN. I'M...
KNITTING LYNETTE AN AFGHAN.

266
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,500
A FRIEND OF MINE
RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE.

267
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,000
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
I EXPECTED.

268
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
MUST BE ONE HECK OF A DOCTOR,
THOUGH, HUH?

269
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,100
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST COME HERE
TO BUY CLEAN URINE.

270
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,700
SHOO!

271
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,500
THOSE ARE ONLY
FOR GROWN-UPS.
WHY?

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
BECAUSE THAT HAVE
SPECIAL MEDICINE IN THEM.

273
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,700
LIKE THE GROWN-UP ICED TEA
YOU ALWAYS DRINK?

274
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
SIMILAR. HOW ABOUT
SOME ICE CREAM INSTEAD?

275
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
AND YOU CAN WATCH TV
TILL YOUR EYES FALL OUT.

276
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
YEAH!
AWESOME.

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,400
<i>YOU</i> STAY.

278
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
GRANDMA NEEDS A FAVOR,

279
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,800
AND YOU'VE GOT
JUST THE FACE FOR IT.

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,800
WOW, SWEETIE.
THOSE REALLY LOOK DELICIOUS,

281
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,900
BUT I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
EATING RIGHT NOW.

282
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,500
JUST ONE, MOM?

283
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,500
I MADE THEM SPECIAL...

284
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,200
JUST FOR YOU.

285
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,900
MMM.
THIS REALLY IS DELICIOUS.

286
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,500
NOW IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,200
YOU CAN REACH ME
ON MY CELL PHONE.

288
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,600
OR THEY CAN JUST
WALK ACROSS THE STREET.

289
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,500
HAVE FUN, GIRLS.
DON'T DO ANYTHING I WOULD DO.
(chuckles)

290
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,400
ADAM SEEMS
REALLY LAID-BACK.

291
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,900
(door opens and shuts)
YEAH, HE'S PRETTY COOL.

292
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,100
OF COURSE, EVERYONE SEEMS COOL
COMPARED TO ROBO-MOM.

293
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,300
(chuckles)
HEY, YOU NEVER TOLD ME.

294
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,600
WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU
ASKED HER ABOUT YOUR REAL DAD?

295
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,600
SHE FREAKED OUT,
JUST LIKE I THOUGHT.

296
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,400
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING.

297
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,800
WELL...

298
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,500
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO FIND THINGS OUT.

299
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,600
DOES YOUR MOM KEEP
ANY OLD PAPERS?

300
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
YOU KNOW,
LETTERS, DIARIES?

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,500
NOT THAT SHE SHOWS ME.

302
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,900
THERE'S STUFF
IN THE STORAGE ROOM UPSTAIRS,

303
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,100
BUT IT'S LOCKED,
SO FORGET ABOUT IT.

304
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
WHAT KIND OF LOCK IS IT?

305
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,500
OH, COME ON IN.
I WAS HOPING YOU WERE SUSAN.

306
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,800
SHE'S NOT HERE?

307
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,100
NO, AND SHE'S NOT
ANSWERING HER CELL PHONE.
WHERE IS SHE?

308
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,300
WELL, SHE HAD AN APPOINTMENT
WITH THIS NEW OBSTETRICIAN

309
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,700
OVER ON RIVER STREET,
BUT SHE SHOULD BE HERE BY NOW.

310
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,100
WHY WOULD SHE SEE A DOCTOR
OVER THERE?

311
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,000
THAT'S
A TERRIBLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT IS?

312
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,100
YES. DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

313
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,000
THAT'S WHERE THEY MURDERED
THOSE TWO PROSTITUTES LAST YEAR.

314
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,900
WE SHOULD HELP MIKE
WITH THE FOOD.

315
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
KNOCK, KNOCK.
(singsong voice) WE'RE HERE.

316
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,500
OH, GOOD!

317
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,900
KATHERINE, I WAS HOPING
WE'D GET A CHANCE TO CHAT.

318
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,600
(lowers voice)
OPEN THIS NOW.

319
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
UGH. SUSAN'S PARTIES ARE
ALWAYS SUCH A SNOOZEFEST.

320
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,300
THE ONLY THING
PEOPLE WILL BE MIMING IS

321
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
"GET ME THE HELL
OUT OF HERE."

322
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,700
AREN'T YOU A LITTLE OVERDRESSED
FOR CHARADES?

323
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
OH, I THOUGHT
THAT I'D LOOK NICE,

324
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,500
JUST IN CASE
WE DECIDED TO...

325
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,200
OH, I DON'T KNOW...
ANNOUNCE OUR ENGAGEMENT?

326
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,900
(chuckles) WE'RE NOT
ANNOUNCING ANYTHING.

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,400
IT'S SUSAN AND MIKE'S PARTY.

328
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,000
I DO NOT WANT TO MAKE IT
ALL ABOUT US.

329
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,600
YOU'RE RIGHT, DARLING.

330
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
I MAY DROP A FEW HINTS,
THOUGH.

331
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
EDIE, LET ME BE CLEAR
ON THIS.

332
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,500
YOU ARE NOT TO TELL ANYONE
ABOUT OUR ENGAGEMENT, GOT IT?

333
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
FINE. I WON'T SAY A WORD.

334
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,200
OH, THIS IS FANTASTIC.

335
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,500
YOU KNOW EDWARD FERBER?
STATE SENATOR?

336
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,000
YES.

337
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,500
HIS WIFE JUST GOT
PICKED UP FOR SHOPLIFTING.

338
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,900
WHY IS THAT FANTASTIC?

339
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,700
HE WAS MAKING NOISES

340
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,700
ABOUT GOING AGAINST ME
FOR GOVERNOR.

341
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,000
I GUESS
THE LIGHT-FINGERED MRS. FERBER

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,500
JUST PUT AN END TO THAT.

343
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
WHY? IT'S NOT LIKE
<i>HE</i> SHOPLIFTED.

344
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,000
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S A SCANDAL.

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO
TO POLL NUMBERS.
(gasps) OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

346
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,900
I WAS READING ABOUT THAT IN
"POLITICS IS BORING" MAGAZINE.

347
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,300
I'M JUST GLAD
I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

348
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,200
ABOUT YOU PULLING CRAP
LIKE THAT.
YEAH, YOU'RE LUCKY.

349
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,800
SO WHERE'S LYNETTE?

350
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,400
SHE'S USUALLY
YOUR CHARADES M.V.P.

351
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
AH, SHE WASN'T FEELING
SO WELL,

352
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,200
BUT, UH, YOU ARE STILL
GOING DOWN, MISTER.

353
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,800
IT'S JUST A GAME, TOM...

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,100
A GAME YOU WISH
YOU NEVER PLAYED.

355
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
SO MUCH WORK...

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,000
AHEM.

357
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
OH, HI, GABY.

358
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,900
KATHERINE AND I WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT THE OLD DAYS.

359
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,800
SO WHEN YOU WERE LIVING
WITH YOUR AUNT,

360
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,600
WAS DYLAN'S FATHER WITH YOU?
NO, JUST ME AND DYLAN.

361
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,100
WERE YOU WIDOWED
OR DIVORCED?

362
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,400
ACTUALLY, I PREFER NOT
TO DISCUSS MY FIRST MARRIAGE...

363
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,100
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

364
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,100
OH. WELL, WE CERTAINLY
DIDN'T MEAN TO PRY.

365
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
LET ME JUST
TIDGE THAT UP FOR YOU.

366
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,300
HELLO, ALL.

367
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,600
AH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
SOME WINE?

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,300
OH, NO.

370
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,300
OH, MY CONTACT SLIPPED.

371
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,200
EDIE,
IS THAT AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

372
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,600
OH! UH, SHOOT.
PRETEND YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

373
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,000
I PROMISED MY FIANC?
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,400
UNTIL
THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

375
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
EXCUSE ME.

376
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,800
GABY! SORRY I'M LATE.

377
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
YOU MADE IT.

378
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,000
THAT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DRESS.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
YOU... COME WITH ME.

380
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,600
SHE'S GOT A RING!
WHAT?

381
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,800
EDIE... SHE'S WEARING
A BIG, HONKIN' ENGAGEMENT RING

382
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,600
THE SIZE OF A PEACH PIT.
HEY, I DIDN'T GET HER
A RING!

383
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,500
OH, SO YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED?
WELL, SEE, HERE'S THE THING...

384
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,000
OH, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!
LET ME EXPLAIN!

385
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,700
NO, NO, NO. I AM DONE
WITH YOUR EXPLANATIONS,

386
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,100
AND I AM DONE WITH "JUST
GIVE ME TWO MORE WEEKS, BABY."

387
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,800
WHATEVER GAMES YOU'RE PLAYING,
I'M SICK OF IT. WE'RE THROUGH.

388
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,900
SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
GO AND LIVE

389
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,600
HAPPILY EVER AFTER
WITH VICTOR, HUH?

390
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,500
(scoffs) YOU THINK VICTOR'S
MY ONLY OPTION?

391
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,400
WELL, I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
CARLOS.

392
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,000
I CAN HAVE ANY GUY I WANT,
BECAUSE <i>THIS...</i>

393
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,500
WAITS FOR NO MAN.

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,500
YOU BOUGHT YOURSELF
AN ENGAGEMENT RING?

395
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,500
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS, CARLOS.
HOW LONG WAS I SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

396
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,400
YOU AGREED
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING.

397
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,200
AH, BUT I DIDN'T AGREE
NOT TO <i>WEAR</i> ANYTHING.

398
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
DON'T WORRY.
IT WASN'T EXPENSIVE.

399
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,000
YOU CAN PAY ME BACK LATER.

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,500
COUNT ON IT.

401
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,500
AND THE WHOLE TIME, I JUST KEPT
THINKING, THIS IS BREE'S DOCTOR.

402
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
<i>BREE</i> RECOMMENDED HIM.

403
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,800
HE MUST BE THE BEST.

404
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,000
SO I DIDN'T WORRY WHEN IT WAS
BETWEEN A NEEDLE EXCHANGE

405
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
AND THE AREA'S ONLY
TRANSVESTITE BOOKSTORE.

406
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,900
AND I IGNORED THAT MY SHOES
STUCK TO THE FLOOR

407
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,700
AND THERE WAS
A CIGARETTE MACHINE

408
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,100
IN THE WAITING ROOM,

409
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,900
BUT WHEN I SAW THE ANT TRAPS
ON HIS SPECULUM TRAY,

410
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,000
I THOUGHT THAT YOU AND I
SHOULD HAVE A TALK.

411
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
OH, SUSAN, I AM SO SORRY,
AND, OF COURSE,

412
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,000
I WILL PAY FOR THE SLASHED TIRE
AND THE STOLEN CELL PHONE.
THAT IS NOT THE POINT!

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
WHY WOULD YOU SEND ME
TO SOMEBODY

414
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,900
WHO IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT YOUR DOCTOR?

415
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,800
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

416
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,500
WHY NOT?

417
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,600
UH... IT'S PRIVATE.

418
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
IS PRIVATE?

419
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,500
THE PARTS OF ME
THAT I'M PRETTY SURE

420
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,300
HE SNAPPED
WITH HIS CAMERA PHONE.

421
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,400
I HAVE A PARTY TO THROW.
I WILL DEAL WITH YOU LATER.

422
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,600
OH! (gasps)

423
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,500
(lowered voice) LOOK, AL,
SHE IS TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

424
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,300
I NEED HER TAKEN CARE OF.

425
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,400
FINE.
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

426
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,800
(beep)
(Edie) I PROMISED MY FIANC?

427
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,300
THAT I WOULDN'T SAY A WORD
UNTIL THE OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

428
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,300
ADAM, I FEEL THE TAG
OF MY DRESS STICKING OUT,

429
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,700
AND I CAN'T REACH IT.
DO YOU MIND?

430
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,300
OH, SURE.

431
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,500
THERE YOU GO.

432
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
OOH! I THINK I GOT A CHILL.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

433
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,600
NOW LET ME SEE
IF I CAN GIVE <i>YOU</i> ONE.
OH, YEAH, IT WORKED.

434
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
(lowered voice) WE HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE AN HOUR,

435
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,800
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
HUMILIATING ME?
ARE WE REALLY HAVING??

436
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,900
OH, I GUESS YOU LEARNED
NOTHING FROM CHICAGO.

437
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
FOR GOD SAKE,
I WAS NOT FLIRTING.

438
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,400
SHE ASKED ME
TO FIX HER DRESS.
YEAH. I SAW YOUR FACE.

439
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,600
I COULD TELL WHAT A CHORE
IT WAS FOR YOU.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

440
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,800
I THINK I'M A LITTLE BEHIND YOU
IN THE ALCOHOL DEPARTMENT.

441
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,500
LET ME GO CATCH UP.

442
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,700
I'M SORRY.

443
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
I, UH, DIDN'T MEAN
TO EAVESDROP,

444
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:15,100
BUT YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
TAKE THIS OUT ON ADAM.

445
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,200
GABRIELLE HAS A LITTLE BIT
OF A REPUTATION,

446
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

447
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,000
NO, I DON'T.

448
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,900
BUT I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO.

449
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,600
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

450
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,100
UM, OKAY.
I WILL BE TEAM CAPTAIN ONE.

451
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
WHO WANTS TO BE
CAPTAIN NUMBER TWO?

452
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,000
I'LL DO IT.
GREAT.

453
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,800
(Susan)
OKAY, YOU PICK FIRST.

454
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,600
OH, OKAY.

455
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I WILL PICK ADAM.

456
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,700
AH.

457
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,900
I PICK LYNETTE.
WHERE'S LYNETTE?

458
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,500
UH, SHE REALLY WANTED
TO BE HERE.

459
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
SHE'S JUST FEELING
TOO SICK TO PARTY.

460
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,100
THAT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

461
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,000
ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S GENIUS.
HE'S A SPONGE, BUT HE TALKS!

462
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
WELL, LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
IS FEELING A LITTLE BETTER.

463
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,700
YEAH. I GUESS
THAT ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICINE

464
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,300
FINALLY KICKED IN.

465
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,200
THAT MUST BE IT.

466
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,300
ORSON.
CARLOS.

467
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,900
UM...
HUSBAND IN THE ROOM?

468
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,600
HONEY, I LOVE YOU,
BUT I WANNA WIN.

469
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
YOU SHOULD PICK EDIE.

470
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,100
WHY?

471
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,800
THE WOMAN JUST TRIED
TO COMMIT SUICIDE.

472
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,100
DON'T MAKE HER LAST PICK.
SHE'S STILL FRAGILE.

473
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,700
GOOD POINT. MIKE!

474
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,800
YES! LET'S GET STARTED.

475
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,000
NO, NO! WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
GABY, YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

476
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,100
OKAY, FIRST, I HAVE TO GO OVER
ALL THE SIGNALS.

477
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,000
(groans)
OKAY, SO, UM,

478
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,200
THIS IS "MOVIE," UM, "TV"...

479
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO DO THIS?

480
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,900
WHEN YOU LIVE WITH A MOTHER WHO
CONSTANTLY LOCKS HERSELF OUT,

481
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
YOU DEVELOP CERTAIN SKILLS.

482
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,100
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THIS IS
A SIGN WE SHOULD STOP.

483
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,100
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING
ABOUT SIGNS?

484
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
"A WHOLE CONCEPT,"
"PERSON," UM, LET'S SEE.

485
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,800
"SHAKESPEARE," "BOOK," AND THEN
IF YOU DO THE SIGNAL FOR "BOOK"

486
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
AND YOU TOUCH YOUR HEART,
THEN THAT'S "POEM."

487
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,900
OKAY, WHEN HAS ANYONE EVER
USED A POEM AS A CLUE?
YEAH, COME ON. LET'S PLAY.

488
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,200
LET'S PLAY!

489
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,700
YEAH! LET'S PLAY!

490
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,900
HEY, HONEY! YOU MADE IT.
HA! DIBS ON LYNETTE!
SHE'S ON MY TEAM!

491
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,000
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
SHE'S LIKE THE CHARADES NINJA.

492
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,700
THAT'S ME! THE NINJA!
WHAA-YA! WHAA!

493
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,300
AHH! (laughs)

494
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,700
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO...
(laughs)

495
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,400
OKAY. (babbles) OKAY!
I'M READY.

496
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,300
OKAY, GO.
(all) SHOE.

497
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,300
SOCK.
WORKING OUT.

498
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
(Bree) BLACK.
(Victor) SOLE.

499
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,600
(Bree) ITCH. ITCH.
SCRATCH.
OH. AAH.

500
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,000
A BLISTER.
HA!

501
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,400
SOUNDS LIKE "BLISTER."
SISTER.
(Victor) KISSED HER.

502
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,700
"TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA"!
(cheering)

503
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,100
OKAY, 22 SECONDS.
LYNETTE, YOU'RE UP.
(Tom) COME ON, BABE.

504
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,000
WE'RE 40 SECONDS DOWN. WE NEED
YOU TO MAKE THAT TIME UP.

505
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?
RIGHT ON.

506
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
(Susan) ALL RIGHT. WHOO!
(clapping)

507
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,700
READY? GET SET... GO.

508
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,900
OKAY.

509
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
HONEY, CLOCK'S TICKING.

510
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,800
I KNOW. JUST,
THIS IS A REALLY HARD ONE.

511
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
OKAY, COME ON, COME ON.
WHAT IS... WHAT IS IT?

512
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,900
IS IT A BOOK? IS IT A MOVIE?
MOVIE. IT'S A WESTERN.

513
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,500
NO TALKING.
SORRY.

514
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,900
HONEY,
START WITH THE FIRST WORD.

515
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,300
HOW MANY SYLLABLES?

516
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
UGH.
ONE WORD.

517
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,500
SWEETIE, ACT IT OUT.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT THAT.

518
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,000
OKAY, OKAY.
WHOLE IDEA.

519
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,400
ME.
EDIE.

520
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,700
WOMAN. BLONDE. BLEACH!

521
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
(grunts) OH! (gasps)

522
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,300
AAH! (imitates choking)

523
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,000
AAH! (grunts)

524
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
"HANG 'EM HIGH"?

525
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,700
YES! YES!

526
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
(Lynette laughing) YES!

527
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,800
OKAY. WELL, I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK.

528
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,000
GOOD IDEA.
YEAH.

529
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
(laughs)
YOU FEELING OKAY?

530
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,700
'CAUSE YOU'RE... ACTING
KINDA SPACEY.

531
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,100
YEAH, NO, I'M GOOD.

532
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,700
HEY, DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE
ANY GRAPES OR LOBSTER?

533
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
WHY... WHY DON'T I GO GET YOU
SOME COFFEE, HON?

534
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,200
UH, UM, ORSON?
HMM?

535
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,400
HEY, UM, THERE'S A PHONE CALL
FOR YOU AT THE HOUSE.

536
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,000
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE IT.

537
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,100
UH, THANKS. YEAH.

538
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,100
HI.
HELLO.

539
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,300
HELLO.

540
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,300
OH, TOM.

541
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,000
STELLA, WHAT...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

542
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,600
UH... I MADE SOME BROWNIES
EARLIER,

543
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,400
AND I JUST... NOTICED
THEY WERE MISSING.

544
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,300
UH... LYNETTE DIDN'T
BRING THEM HERE, DID SHE?

545
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,600
WHY? IS THAT A PROBLEM?

546
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,800
IT'S LIKE CHOCOLATE LOVE.
OH!

547
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

548
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
SORRY, UH, DON'T EAT THOSE.
DON'T EAT THOSE. SORRY.

549
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,500
UH, NO! OOH. BAD BATCH.
<i>BAD.</i> BAD, BAD, BAD.

550
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,500
WHOA. (chuckles) SORRY.
FULL OF TRANS FATS.

551
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,900
OH!
OH!

552
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,600
OH! TOM, WATCH IT!
I AM SORRY.

553
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,900
OH, HERE. OH.
LET ME GET THAT.

554
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,300
THANK YOU.
OH, GOD. OKAY.

555
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,600
IT'S A LITTLE COLD.

556
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,000
SORRY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

557
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH
TO ASK YOU

558
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,200
TO KEEP YOUR HANDS
OFF MY HUSBAND?

559
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
WHAT?
I SPILLED MY DRINK ON HIM.

560
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
AND YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE UP
FOR IT BY BREAST-FEEDING HIM?

561
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,600
UH, KATHERINE?

562
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
LOOK, LADY,
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

563
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,800
YOU'RE GETTING A REPUTATION
AROUND HERE

564
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,500
FOR HAVING A STICK
UP YOUR ASS.

565
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,900
BETTER THAT REPUTATION THAN
THE ONE YOU'RE TOTING AROUND.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

566
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,900
OKAY, BACK TO CHARADES.
NEVER MIND. FORGET IT.

567
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,000
OH, NO, NO. TELL ME.
WHAT'S MY "REPUTATION"?

568
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
AM I SMUG
AND HOLIER-THAN-THOU?

569
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,200
OH, NO, WAIT.
THAT'S YOU.

570
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
LET ME BE SPECIFIC.

571
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,300
BY "REPUTATION," I MEAN
THAT YOU ARE THE KIND OF WOMAN

572
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,900
THAT TREATS A MAN
LIKE A PLAYTHING,

573
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,400
WHETHER IT'S MY HUSBAND OR LET'S
SAY... YOUR TEENAGE GARDENER?

574
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,800
BREE SAW YOU SLAP
YOUR DAUGHTER.

575
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,200
EXCUSE ME?

576
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,400
(whispers) GABY!

577
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,000
YEAH, SHE ASKED ABOUT HER FATHER
AND THEN YOU SMACKED HER.

578
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,900
WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

579
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,800
THIS IS THE LAST THING
THAT I WILL EVER SAY TO YOU.

580
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,200
YES, I LOST MY TEMPER
WITH DYLAN,

581
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,200
BUT HER FATHER
IS A HORRIBLE MAN.

582
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,100
I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE
THE WORST THING

583
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,400
THAT A FATHER CAN DO
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

584
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,000
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO TELL DYLAN ABOUT THAT, HMM?

585
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,500
I HOPE THAT SATISFIES
EVERYONE'S CURIOSITY.

586
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,500
OH, MY GOD.

587
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,300
"HANG 'EM HIGH"
HAS THREE SYLLABLES.

588
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,400
I GUESS YOU... SAW
WHAT HAPPENED DOWN THERE.

589
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,900
YEP.

590
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,300
LOOK,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,

591
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,800
AND... AND IT DIDN'T MEAN
ANYTHING.

592
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,100
HOW MANY PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

593
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,400
NOW OR BEFORE TONIGHT?

594
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
HOW MANY?

595
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,900
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET.
I'M NOT UPSET.

596
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,200
I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK OUT
HOW TO SPIN THIS.

597
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
CLEARLY,
THE BOY WAS UNDERAGE.

598
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,900
DO YOU THINK
MONEY WOULD SHUT HIM UP?

599
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,200
VICTOR, REALLY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

600
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,100
HMM. THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT ME.

601
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
OKAY, YOU'VE GOT
TO REMEMBER THIS.

602
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,200
THIS IS BODSWORTH.
YOU TOOK HIM EVERYWHERE.

603
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,700
NO, I THINK I'D REMEMBER
A BEAR THAT UGLY.

604
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,500
WELL, CLEARLY, IT'S YOURS.

605
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,800
YOUR MOM KEPT IT
ALL THESE YEARS,

606
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,900
AND HE'S HERE
IN YOUR OLD ROOM.

607
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,100
WAIT. THIS WAS MY OLD ROOM?
MY MOM TOLD ME

608
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,900
I'M IN MY OLD ROOM
DOWN THE HALL.

609
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,200
NO, THIS WAS YOUR ROOM.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

610
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,000
EVENING, GIRLS.

611
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,200
HEY. HOW WAS THE PARTY?

612
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,900
IT WAS LOVELY.

613
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,900
I THINK YOUR MOTHER WOULD
LIKE YOU HOME TO HELP CLEAN UP.

614
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,300
I'M SORRY, MOM.

615
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
IT'S OKAY, SWEETIE.

616
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,700
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
SEEING THAT GIRL ANYMORE.

617
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,000
ORSON, HONEY,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

618
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,900
WE GOT A CALL
FROM DANIELLE'S DOCTOR.

619
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,800
APPARENTLY, HER FALL CAUSED
A PLACENTAL ABRUPTION,

620
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,600
WHERE THE PLACENTA
SEPARATES FROM THE UTERUS.
OH, MY GOD.

621
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,200
NOW THEY SAID NOT TO PANIC.
THERE ARE DEGREES OF THIS.

622
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,900
THEY'RE DOING A SONOGRAM,
THEN THEY'RE GONNA CALL US.

623
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,700
I CAN'T WAIT THAT LONG.
I HAVE TO BE WITH HER.

624
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,100
OKAY. I'LL GET YOUR PURSE.
HMM?

625
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?
YOU CAN'T LEAVE YET.

626
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,800
SOMETHING'S COME UP.
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

627
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
NO, WE'LL TALK NOW.

628
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,500
YOU STILL OWE ME AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT SCUZZY GYNO

629
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,900
YOU SENT ME TO.
I SAID I WAS SORRY.
FOR GOD SAKES, SUSAN,

630
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,800
NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.

631
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,700
OH, I KNOW THIS NIGHT
HAS BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER,

632
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,300
BUT ALL IN ALL, IT'S STILL
YOUR BEST PARTY EVER.

633
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
I'M CONFUSED.

634
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
OW! NOW I'M CONFUSED,
AND MY HEAD HURTS.

635
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,100
THAT'S FOR LETTING EDIE
THINK YOU'RE ENGAGED.
AND THE KISS?

636
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,800
WHEN YOU SAW ME FLIRTING,
YOU SMASHED A GLASS.

637
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,200
WHEN VICTOR HEARD
I HAD AN AFFAIR,

638
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,500
HE STARTED CRUNCHING
POLL NUMBERS.

639
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,000
I NEED A MAN
WHO CARES ENOUGH TO EXPLODE

640
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,500
WHEN HE THINKS
HE'S GONNA LOSE ME.

641
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,800
I DON'T JUST LOVE YOU.
ILOVETHE <i>WAY</i> YOU LOVE ME.

642
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,800
SO WE'RE BACK ON?

643
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,700
SEE YOU THURSDAY.

644
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,300
AL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR ME?

645
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
I think I found a way
to make this happen,

646
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,100
but it might take a week or two
to line everything up.

647
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,100
FANTASTIC.

648
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,400
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT'S DONE.
SHIRLEY?

649
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,300
CAN YOU MAKE SOME COPIES
OF THE BRITT FILE?

650
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,400
AHH.

651
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,100
SEEN GABY?

652
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,800
UH, YEAH,
IN THE BATHROOM UPSTAIRS.

653
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,400
TELL ME SOMETHING.

654
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,400
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
THAT KID WHO YOU WERE PAYING

655
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,200
TO MOW YOUR LAWN
WAS DOING YOUR WIFE,

656
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,700
HOW DID YOU NOT KILL HIM?

657
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,300
WELL, I WANTED TO AT FIRST,
BUT...

658
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,100
HEY, WE'RE ALL HUMAN, RIGHT?
WE GOTTA FORGIVE AND FORGET.

659
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,000
YOU'RE
A VERY UNDERSTANDING MAN.

660
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,200
IF SHE PULLED
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON ME,

661
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
THAT GUY WOULDN'T BE AROUND
FOR LONG.

662
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,300
YEAH, BUT NO WOMAN'S WORTH
GOING TO JAIL FOR, RIGHT?

663
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY,

664
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,300
IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO MAKE SOMEONE DISAPPEAR.
(footsteps descend stairs)

665
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,100
LET'S GO, HONEY.

666
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,600
NIGHT, CARLOS.

667
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
DARLING,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

668
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,300
I HAVE TO BRING
THIS DVD PLAYER TO DANIELLE.

669
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,200
HONEY, WE REALLY HAVE TO GO.

670
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,400
IT'LL JUST TAKE A FEW SECONDS.
THESE DAMN CORDS...

671
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,500
SWEETHEART, IT'S A LONG DRIVE.
IT'S THE ONLY THING
SHE ASKED FOR.

672
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,100
(beep)
YES. HELLO?

673
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,000
HELLO, DOCTOR.

674
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,700
HOW IS SHE?

675
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,099
THANK GOD.

676
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,800
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

677
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,300
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

678
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,900
KIDS ARE ALL TUCKED IN.

679
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
THEY'RE SLEEPING
LIKE ANGELS.

680
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,700
GREAT. DID YOU PUT QUAALUDES
IN THEIR COCOA?

681
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,300
COULD YOU CHECK ON 'EM FOR ME,
PLEASE?

682
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,900
SO HOW WAS THE PARTY?

683
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,199
YOU DRUGGED ME.

684
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,400
OH. JUST A LITTLE.

685
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,799
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

686
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,100
I TOLD YOU,
I DIDN'T WANT ANY POT.

687
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,800
BEFORE YOU SLAP ME AROUND,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

688
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,200
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

689
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,900
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

690
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,900
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
USING MY SON AS A DRUG MULE?

691
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,800
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

692
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:20,300
AND WHY ARE YOU MAKING
SUCH A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT?

693
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,500
LET ME ASK <i>YOU</i> SOMETHING.

694
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,800
DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT I WORE
TO THE JUNIOR PROM

695
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,500
OR WHAT PART I HAD
IN THE PLAY THAT YEAR?

696
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,000
WHO REMEMBERS THAT STUFF?

697
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,000
PARENTS WHO WEREN'T STONED.

698
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,299
MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
PASSED IN A BLUR

699
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,700
BECAUSE <i>YOU</i> WERE
MEDICATING YOURSELF...

700
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,499
POT WHEN YOU WERE SICK,
BOOZE WHEN YOU WEREN'T.

701
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,900
I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT.

702
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:46,600
I WON'T MISS A SECOND
OF MY KIDS' LIVES,

703
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,100
NOT IF I CAN AVOID IT.

704
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,500
WELL, I'D SAY I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M NOT.

705
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
YOU'RE A MOM. YOU KNOW,

706
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,600
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN
WATCHING YOUR KIDS SUFFER,

707
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,599
AND SEEING YOU...
ACT ALL GOOFY,

708
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,700
WATCHING THAT CARTOON,
WELL...

709
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,800
IT WAS PROBABLY
THE HIGH POINT OF MY TRIP.

710
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,700
I GET IT.

711
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,100
BUT IF YOU EVER PULL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN...

712
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,499
I WON'T.

713
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,800
OKAY. WELL...

714
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,300
I THINK I'LL TURN IN.

715
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,900
YENTA.

716
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,099
WHAT?

717
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,800
JUNIOR YEAR, YOU WERE YENTA
IN "FIDDLER ON THE ROOF."

718
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,600
YOU REMEMBERED.

719
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,900
YEAH. THERE ARE
SOME PERFORMANCES SO BAD,

720
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,200
EVEN ALCOHOL
CAN'T BLOCK THEM OUT.

721
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,200
BREE?

722
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,100
CAN WE CALL A TRUCE,
PLEASE?

723
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
SO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT BLUFFING, UM,

724
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
I BROUGHT CAKE.

725
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,300
I AM SO SORRY THAT
I SNAPPED AT YOU TONIGHT.

726
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,300
IT'S OKAY.

727
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,300
I JUST WANNA KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

728
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,299
EVER SINCE
YOU'VE BEEN PREGNANT,

729
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,400
THERE'S BEEN THIS WALL
BETWEEN US.

730
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,700
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S CHANGED,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

731
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,000
DID I DO SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?

732
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,699
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

733
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,200
I'VE JUST BEEN
GOING THROUGH SOME THINGS.

734
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,300
LIKE WHAT? I MEAN,
COME ON. JUST TELL ME.

735
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,400
WE SHARE EVERYTHING.

736
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,500
OKAY. UM...

737
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,400
I HAVEN'T TOLD ANYBODY THIS,
BUT...

738
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,500
IT'S, UH, ABOUT THE BABY.

739
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,500
THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME COMPLICATIONS.

740
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,200
OH, NO.

741
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,000
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

742
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,900
YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE,
BUT, UH,

743
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,600
THERE WAS JUST A TIME WHERE
I THOUGHT I MIGHT LOSE IT.

744
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,700
OH, MY GOD.
AND THERE I WAS,

745
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,499
JUST BUGGING YOU
ABOUT YOUR DOCTOR.

746
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,699
I AM SO SORRY.
YOU SHOULD'VE JUST TOLD ME.

747
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,600
NO, YOU'RE PREGNANT, TOO.

748
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,000
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ANYTHING
THAT'S GONNA WORRY YOU.

749
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?

750
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,699
IT'S THE FIRST BABY I'VE HAD
IN 17 YEARS.

751
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,500
YOU KNOW, I COULD NOT POSSIBLY
BE MORE FREAKED OUT.
MM.

752
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,100
THIS MORNING,
I CAUGHT MIKE BUILDING A CRIB.

753
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,700
NO. THIS EARLY?

754
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,100
YEAH! I-I WANTED TO SCREAM.

755
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,400
YOU KNOW, ARE YOU NUTS?
DO YOU JUST WANNA JINX IT?

756
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,799
THIS IS WHAT WE GET
FOR HAVING KIDS AT OUR AGE...

757
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,600
ANXIETY, TERROR.

758
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,300
IT'S JUST GONNA GET WORSE.

759
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,400
DO YOU KNOW, WHEN OUR BABIES
GO TO COLLEGE,

760
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,300
WE'LL BE LIKE...

761
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,600
DEAD?

762
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
(laughs) IF WE'RE LUCKY.

763
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,600
LOOK AT US.

764
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,000
PREGNANT GALS, EATING CAKE
AND BITCHIN'. (laughs)

765
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
IT'S KINDA NICE, HUH?

766
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,900
IT REALLY IS.

767
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

768
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,499
THE HOSPITAL CALLED.
MY AUNT'S READY TO COME HOME.

769
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,800
AND YOU WANT HER
TO STAY IN HERE?

770
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,899
YEAH. I THINK MAKING THIS ROOM
OFF-LIMITS WAS A MISTAKE.

771
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,099
IF I WANT DYLAN
TO FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS,

772
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,100
I REALLY NEED TO MAKE IT
LESS INTRIGUING.

773
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,600
SPEAKING OF INTRIGUING,

774
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,500
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
LAST NIGHT?

775
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,700
WHAT?

776
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,500
COME ON. "THE WORST THING
A FATHER COULD DO"?

777
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,800
YOU REALIZE WHAT PEOPLE
ARE GONNA THINK.

778
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
YEAH. THEY'RE GONNA BE
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,

779
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,400
AND UNCOMFORTABLE PEOPLE
DON'T ASK QUESTIONS.

780
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,900
(children screaming
and shouting)

781
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,300
<i>ALL CHILDREN LOVE GAMES.</i>

782
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,400
<i>BUT CHILDREN GROW UP,</i>

783
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,800
<i>AND THEN THEY FIND</i>
<i>NEW GAMES TO PLAY.</i>

784
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,700
<i>THEY PRETEND TO BE WELL</i>
<i>SO THEIR FAMILIES WON'T WORRY.</i>

785
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,600
<i>THEY LIE TO THEIR LOVERS</i>

786
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,300
<i>ABOUT WHERE THEY GO</i>
<i>IN THE AFTERNOON.</i>

787
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:39,000
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S WHY
IT WAS SO GREAT.
OH!

788
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,800
<i>THEY INVENT STORIES TO HIDE</i>
<i>THE TRUTH FROM THEIR FRIENDS.</i>

789
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,700
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
OH, ONE MORE. HERE YOU GO.

790
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,700
<i>YES...</i>

791
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
<i>SOMEONE GETS HURT.</i>
