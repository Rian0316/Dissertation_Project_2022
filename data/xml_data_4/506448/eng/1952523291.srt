1
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:13,408
Mrs. Barclay, your tea.

2
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:16,703
All these years, how could you
do such a thing?

3
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:18,538
Your tea, madam.

4
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,081
Oh, I hate you, I hate you,

5
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,500
I hate you, I hate you.

6
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,543
David -

7
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,128
Your tea, madam.

8
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,671
David, you betrayed him.

9
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,006
Mrs. Fenning-

10
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,135
What's happened, what is it, child?

11
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,595
It's madam and the Colonel,

12
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,221
something awful is going on

13
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,764
and I can't open the door.

14
00:01:36,848 --> 00:01:38,892
Here, let me try.

15
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,813
Stop him, both of you.

16
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,481
Mrs. Barclay,

17
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,984
Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

18
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,970
Mrs. Barclay, open the door.

19
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:17,263
The door is locked on the inside as well,

20
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,766
and there's no key.

21
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,061
I'm going out for a doctor,
and the police.

22
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:01,015
... There's quite a few of them

23
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,142
when I sailed home wounded.

24
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:05,812
Had a good record out in India,

25
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,689
did wonders during the Mutiny.

26
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,108
I'm sure you won't regret
taking the case.

27
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,527
Ah, sentry.

28
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,958
Dr. John Watson,
formerly medical officer

29
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,043
attached to the Royal Berkshires,

30
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,503
now in civilian practice.

31
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:32,088
Murphy, second in command,

32
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,799
temporarily in charge
of the Royal Mallows,

33
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:37,177
following the, tragedy
of our Colonel's death.

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,262
And this will be Mr. Holmes?

35
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,847
Please.

36
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:49,272
It's good of you to come so swiftly.

37
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:50,940
Not at all.

38
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,526
I have explained to Holmes
how concerned

39
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,071
you must be about the
possibility of a scandal.

40
00:03:57,155 --> 00:04:00,909
Thank you.

41
00:04:01,034 --> 00:04:05,371
The honor of the regiment is in my care.

42
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:08,833
And yet, the newspapers report suggest

43
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:11,544
that a scandal is inevitable.

44
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,004
Surely not.

45
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,923
I've done my utmost
to make sure that reporters

46
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:16,799
were kept as far away as possible.

47
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:19,052
Exactly, and that is what
has made them suspicious.

48
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,596
They scent a mystery, that much is clear

49
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,141
from the little they have
been able to say.

50
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:29,729
Surely, it would be wrong to repeat,

51
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:32,565
to draw attention to -

52
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,569
Quite.

53
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:46,204
You see how much we need
your help, Mr. Holmes.

54
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:50,041
What do you say, Holmes?

55
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,127
What can I say?

56
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,881
Major Murphy, you have
told me nothing.

57
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,383
I have come down here

58
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:01,177
after persuasion from
my friend, to Aldershot,

59
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,430
who has more interest in
military matters than I.

60
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:16,442
Now that I am here,
please tell me the facts.

61
00:05:16,526 --> 00:05:18,695
The commanding officer
of this regiment,

62
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,154
Colonel James Barclay,

63
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:21,948
was found dead in his villa

64
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,784
at about 10 o'clock
the night before last.

65
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,245
The body was found by Private Bates,

66
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,789
his batman, lying in the morning room.

67
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:32,167
There was a ragged cut,
two-inches long,

68
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:33,793
on the back of his head,

69
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:36,087
which had evidently been caused
by a violent blow

70
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,714
from a blunt instrument.

71
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,674
And upon the floor by the body

72
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:46,681
was a singular hand-carved
wooden club.

73
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,309
Also, stretched out on the sofa

74
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,978
lying in a dead faint, was Nancy Bar -

75
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,814
Mrs. Barclay.

76
00:05:54,939 --> 00:06:00,653
Please continue, Major Murphy.

77
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,739
The servants had been alerted
to the tragedy

78
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,407
by the sounds of a quarrel

79
00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,659
between the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay.

80
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,578
They tried to enter the morning room

81
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:10,163
but found it locked.

82
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,040
Bates had to go around by the garden

83
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:13,708
and get in through the french windows.

84
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,627
And now you suspect Mrs. Barclay?

85
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,836
Yes.

86
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,505
But she is quite incapable

87
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,217
of such a dreadful act!

88
00:06:22,342 --> 00:06:24,010
I have been the late Colonel's

89
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,970
second in command
for a number of years.

90
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:31,017
I've come to know Nancy Barclay well.

91
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:36,314
Of course.

92
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,691
Tell me about Colonel Barclay,

93
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:42,487
was he highly regarded by
the men under his command?

94
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,990
Considering his background,
remarkably so.

95
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:49,035
His background, why,
was he ever disgraced?

96
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,955
No, but it's not generally known outside

97
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,916
that Jim Barclay began his career

98
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,836
as a private soldier in the Mallows.

99
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,004
Did he, indeed?

100
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,798
From private soldier to
commanding officer

101
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,383
in the same regiment,

102
00:07:03,508 --> 00:07:05,885
that's a rare achievement.

103
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:07,387
I was his gallantry in the Indian Mutiny

104
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,514
that got him his commission,

105
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:14,602
and then quite rapid promotion
over the years,

106
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:18,439
more rapid than mine, for instance.

107
00:07:18,565 --> 00:07:21,734
Impressive.

108
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,946
And I suppose the unfortunate
Mrs. Barclay is in custody?

109
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:29,075
No, not exactly, no.

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,619
She's in hospital, being looked after,

111
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,788
with a police constable standing by.

112
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,128
Nancy Barclay is a
handsome woman now,

113
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:41,713
but you should have seen her

114
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:48,428
as a young girl in India, 30 years ago.

115
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,306
She was a daughter of the regiment.

116
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:55,894
Her father was the Regimental
Sergeant Major, RSM Devoy,

117
00:07:55,977 --> 00:08:02,108
and therefore quite a formidable
father-in-law for any soldier.

118
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:04,277
I remember that all
the men in my company

119
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:08,615
thought her quite the
prettiest girl in the garrison.

120
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:10,909
As a junior officer I had
little to do with her,

121
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:14,120
but I was aware that
she was a most charming,

122
00:08:14,245 --> 00:08:18,666
most vivacious and spirited girl.

123
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:28,134
It was quite understandable

124
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,678
that Barclay was not the only
man in the regiment

125
00:08:30,803 --> 00:08:33,306
who sought her hand.

126
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:37,143
But, in the end, he was
the one she chose.

127
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,319
They were married at Bhurtee,

128
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:48,780
not far from Cornpor a few months after

129
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:50,657
the besieged garrison there

130
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,825
was relieved by General Neill's column

131
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:55,161
in the summer of 1858.

132
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,705
Shortly after the marriage,

133
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:02,252
Sergeant Barclay got his
commission, as expected.

134
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,837
It must have been difficult

135
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,880
for the Barclays at first,

136
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,216
NCO, promoted from the ranks,

137
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,219
married to a regimental
Sergeant Major's daughter?

138
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:17,016
Yes, I believe there was
some little social friction.

139
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,272
But, Nancy carried it off
with dignity and charm,

140
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:25,316
and they gained acceptance in no time.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,652
Barclay's career flourished,

142
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:32,073
and the regiment returned
from India some five years ago.

143
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:36,369
Barclay was then appointed
to commanding officer.

144
00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:40,540
And the marriage continued
to be a happy one?

145
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:43,877
It appeared to be so.

146
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,253
Appeared?

147
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,046
Most people believe the marriage

148
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,718
to have been a uniformly happy one.

149
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:56,264
And what do you believe,
Major Murphy?

150
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,850
My position as second in command

151
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:01,644
often took me to the Barclay's house.

152
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,274
I saw a different side to the marriage.

153
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,235
The truth is more important

154
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:13,656
than loyalty to your late commander.

155
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,868
One night I had been
dining at the Barclays.

156
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,162
It wasn't until I reached
the end of the drive

157
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,331
that I realized I'd left my cigar case

158
00:10:21,456 --> 00:10:23,208
in the dining room.

159
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,753
I went back, the front door
was still open;

160
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,088
Jane, the maid, was in the hall.

161
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:32,383
I'm glad you're still here,

162
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:34,093
I left my cigar case on the table.

163
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:35,762
I think the Colonel and Mrs. Barclay

164
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:37,597
have gone to bed, sir.

165
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:39,599
Oh, for goodness sake, James.

166
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,559
Confess then, who is it, who?

167
00:10:41,643 --> 00:10:46,231
Let go of me, you're hurting me.

168
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,107
Tell me you love me then,

169
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,692
me and nobody else.

170
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,444
Do you hear, do you hear me?

171
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,572
Oh, would I have married you
if I didn't?

172
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,076
I don't know, sometimes I wonder.

173
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,168
And this expression of jealousy

174
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,921
occurred within seconds of you,
Major Murphy,

175
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,756
leaving the Barclays' house.

176
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,842
Tell me about the Colonel,

177
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,345
was he a violent man in any way?

178
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,514
On occasion.

179
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,140
He could be most vindictive

180
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,810
towards young subalterns.

181
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:27,146
But he'd clawed his way to the top,

182
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:29,732
you need to be ruthless to do that.

183
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:31,234
Surely he didn't still feel

184
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:33,194
out of place as an officer?

185
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,154
No, I don't think so,

186
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,490
but he was subject to
a peculiar form of depression.

187
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,954
The Queen.

188
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:45,123
The Queen.

189
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:58,636
Sometimes when we were
discussing old campaigns,

190
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,599
the premier, the Mutiny, Afghan War,

191
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:06,519
the smile would often be
struck from his mouth

192
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:10,565
as if by some invisible hand.

193
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:20,200
Yes, long service in India

194
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:22,202
can have that effect.

195
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,579
I saw that when I was in the Berkshires.

196
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:27,207
You mentioned a carved wooden club

197
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,375
found by the body,

198
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,670
one of the Colonel's Indian souvenirs?

199
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,214
I believe the servants deny

200
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:36,716
ever having seen this club before.

201
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,968
Certainly I've never seen it
on any of my visits.

202
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,262
It was quite long.

203
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,264
And the police, I suppose,

204
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,016
have retained it for examination?

205
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,476
Yes.

206
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:48,436
They believe it to be
the murder weapon.

207
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,313
Do they, indeed?

208
00:12:50,438 --> 00:12:52,148
I think we should begin

209
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,067
by visiting the Barclays' house,

210
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,693
unless, of course,

211
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,488
it is possible to interview
Mrs. Barclay?

212
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:02,659
I'm afraid she's still unconscious.

213
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,494
I thought as much.

214
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:16,756
David, David.

215
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,695
What a beautiful morning.

216
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,990
Holmes, suppose Mrs. Barclay

217
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:46,494
had a lover and the Colonel
had found out?

218
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:50,415
Major Murphy seems to have
been rather close to her.

219
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:53,710
You know, mild adultery

220
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,378
has always been commonplace

221
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,297
among officers and their wives

222
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,632
serving in hot climates.

223
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:01,009
Thank you, Watson,

224
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,845
for educating me in military morality.

225
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,388
If there had been anything

226
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,473
between Major Murphy and
Mrs. Barclay,

227
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:09,392
would he have related the incident

228
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:11,144
of his forgotten cigar case?

229
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,778
I was about half past seven, sir,

230
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,905
and I was waiting a table.

231
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,406
Once a month, Mrs. Barclay spent

232
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,785
the evening doing
charity work in Aldershot.

233
00:15:45,613 --> 00:15:48,032
Where are you off to in such a hurry?

234
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:52,620
Well, the distribution of old
clothing starts at 8 o'clock,

235
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:54,998
and I promised Ann Morrison

236
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:58,084
I'd be at the mission hall on time.

237
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,753
Well, if you want to
catch some filthy disease

238
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,798
dealing with a lot of flea
ridden down and outs,

239
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,383
I suppose that's your affair.

240
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,051
I believe in putting back into life

241
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,554
as much as one gets out of it.

242
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:13,933
We've been fortunate with our lot;

243
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:20,481
others haven't been so lucky.

244
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,483
Don't be late back.

245
00:16:22,567 --> 00:16:25,153
Of course not.

246
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,958
Mrs. Barclay must have returned

247
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,419
about quarter past nine, sir.

248
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:45,840
I was in the kitchen helping
the cook with the dishes.

249
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,634
There was thunder in the distance,

250
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:49,636
and I was just saying to Mrs. Fenning

251
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:51,596
that there was a storm brewing,

252
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,681
when the morning room bell rang.

253
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:57,769
I came up here to find that
Mrs. Barclay had returned.

254
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,313
She was walking up and down
this room, sir,

255
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:07,320
very pale, upset.

256
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:11,824
She looked awful, sir.

257
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,290
You rang, madam?

258
00:17:19,374 --> 00:17:24,504
Yes, Jane, bring me some tea, will you?

259
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:28,216
Of course, madam.

260
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:45,608
Jane, is that you?

261
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:49,112
Yes, sir.

262
00:17:49,237 --> 00:17:52,448
Did I hear Mrs. Barclay come in?

263
00:17:52,574 --> 00:17:55,827
Yes, sir, she's in the morning room.

264
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,370
The morning room?

265
00:17:57,453 --> 00:17:58,413
Yes, sir.

266
00:17:58,538 --> 00:18:00,915
I'm just about to take her a pot of tea.

267
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,463
Tea? what does she want tea for
at this hour?

268
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:24,397
And that, presumably,

269
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:27,859
was the last time that anyone
saw Colonel Barclay alive?

270
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:31,196
Yes, sir.

271
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,656
Can you think of any reason

272
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,285
why your mistress came
into this morning room

273
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,788
at that time of night,
when the fire was unlit?

274
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:42,373
No, sir.

275
00:18:42,457 --> 00:18:44,250
Did she often make a point

276
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:48,630
of purposely avoiding the Colonel?

277
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:54,260
Had you ever heard
them arguing before?

278
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:59,641
Not to my knowledge, sir.

279
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,476
When you returned from the kitchen

280
00:19:01,601 --> 00:19:03,645
with Mrs. Barclay's tea,

281
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,605
you found the door locked,

282
00:19:05,688 --> 00:19:07,357
and you heard voices raised.

283
00:19:07,482 --> 00:19:10,318
Now, what exactly did you hear?

284
00:19:10,443 --> 00:19:15,073
They were arguing, sir.

285
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:18,368
Mrs. Barclay called the Colonel
a coward.

286
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:22,747
She said you have ruined
my life all these years.

287
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:26,125
Mrs. Barclay shouted the name "David,"

288
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:30,171
she said it twice.

289
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:32,340
David?

290
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:33,967
Could you swear to that?

291
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,302
I was perfectly clear, sir.

292
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:39,722
But the Colonel's name was James.

293
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,140
Have you ever heard

294
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,977
Mrs. Barclay refer to
anyone called David?

295
00:19:44,102 --> 00:19:46,521
No, sir, I don't think she
or the Colonel

296
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,481
knew anyone by the name of David.

297
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:53,194
And Major Murphy's christian
name is Patrick.

298
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,530
Had they had any visitors recently

299
00:19:55,655 --> 00:19:57,448
by the name of David?

300
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,410
I don't think so, sir.

301
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:02,704
The club that was found

302
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,331
by Colonel Barclay's body,

303
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:07,333
had you seen it before?

304
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:08,918
No, sir.

305
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,670
The Colonel had several trophies
from India,

306
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:14,007
but nothing like that club.

307
00:20:14,132 --> 00:20:17,010
Are you sure of that, Miss Stewart?

308
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,553
Yes, sir.

309
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:24,434
I don't know where it came from.

310
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,522
Thank you, that is all.

311
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:32,984
Oh, no, there is just one last thing,

312
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:35,153
Major Murphy once left
his cigar case here,

313
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,530
did you manage to find it?

314
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:40,408
Yes, sir.

315
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:54,714
The Colonel was lying down here, sir.

316
00:20:54,797 --> 00:20:56,591
With his head by the fender?

317
00:20:56,716 --> 00:20:58,718
Yes, sir.

318
00:20:58,801 --> 00:21:02,639
You can see the mark of the blood still.

319
00:21:02,764 --> 00:21:06,935
But the most frightening thing
of all, sir, was his face.

320
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,436
His face?

321
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,313
When I rolled him over.

322
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:14,400
I almost fainted away to look upon it.

323
00:21:14,484 --> 00:21:18,780
It was all contorted, screwed up,

324
00:21:18,905 --> 00:21:23,701
with the most horrible look
of fear and terror.

325
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:29,874
As if he'd foreseen his own death?

326
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:33,086
Quite possible, sir.

327
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:37,799
Thank you, Bates.

328
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:40,802
What apparition, what monster was it

329
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:46,099
that could have frightened
the Colonel so.

330
00:21:46,224 --> 00:21:50,687
Not Nancy Barclay, for sure.

331
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:52,647
This door was locked shut, sir,

332
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:57,652
and what's more, the key was missing.

333
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,529
Missing?

334
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:01,614
Yes, in the end we had to send

335
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,783
for a locksmith to open it.

336
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:06,119
You have made a thorough
search for the key?

337
00:22:06,202 --> 00:22:07,745
We searched high and low.

338
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:09,372
Mrs. Barclay hadn't got it,

339
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,666
and it wasn't in the Colonel's
pocket, sir.

340
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:17,463
Thank you, Mrs. Fenning.

341
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:23,636
Watson, if the key was not in the door,

342
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,184
and neither Mrs. Barclay nor
the Colonel had it, then -

343
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,939
Then there must have been
a third person.

344
00:22:35,023 --> 00:22:41,696
Exactly,

345
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:52,081
who either entered or left
through those windows.

346
00:22:58,213 --> 00:23:05,762
These are Bates' footprints.

347
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:09,682
But these, are the footprints of
someone else.

348
00:23:09,807 --> 00:23:13,811
Someone has recently
crossed this lawn,

349
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:17,273
the marks are just visible.

350
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:34,999
He entered and left through
those windows, Watson,

351
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:37,210
we're on the right search.

352
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:48,429
Watson, look at this.

353
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:50,056
What is it?

354
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:52,934
Our entrant had a somewhat
unusual companion.

355
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,603
It's a dog, isn't it, somebody's dog?

356
00:23:55,728 --> 00:23:57,313
Whoever heard of a dog

357
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:59,023
running up a curtain.

358
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:00,900
What about a cat then?

359
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:03,027
These claw marks are not
those of a cat,

360
00:24:03,111 --> 00:24:04,988
nor of a monkey, nor of any creature

361
00:24:05,113 --> 00:24:07,240
that we are familiar with.

362
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:11,411
I would think from hind foot to forefoot

363
00:24:11,536 --> 00:24:14,581
at least 15 inches.

364
00:24:14,664 --> 00:24:16,749
Add to that the length of neck and head,

365
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:19,669
you have a creature
no less than two feet,

366
00:24:19,794 --> 00:24:21,921
more if there's a tail.

367
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,965
The length of its stride is odd,

368
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,509
it indicates a creature

369
00:24:26,634 --> 00:24:28,887
with a long back and short legs.

370
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,181
Something like a stoat or a weasel?

371
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,392
We also know that it is carnivorous.

372
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:36,603
How can you tell that?

373
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:41,774
Well you see what made it
run up the curtain.

374
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,359
The canary.

375
00:24:43,484 --> 00:24:45,486
Exactly.

376
00:24:45,612 --> 00:24:47,697
Then what was this beast?

377
00:24:56,581 --> 00:25:00,543
No, I can't, I cannot betray a friend,

378
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:04,047
please don't ask me to.

379
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,189
Miss Morrison,

380
00:25:21,272 --> 00:25:27,612
when Mrs. Barclay left her house
to come here two nights ago,

381
00:25:27,695 --> 00:25:32,158
she was happy and content.

382
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:33,743
When she returned two hours later,

383
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,161
she was a changed woman.

384
00:25:35,286 --> 00:25:40,416
Now the police suspect her of murder.

385
00:25:40,542 --> 00:25:44,838
You owe it to your friend to
clear her name.

386
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:47,173
You must tell me
what happened last night

387
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:50,510
that so changed her.

388
00:25:50,593 --> 00:25:55,932
Very well, I shall break my
promise of silence

389
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:59,894
if what I can say can really help her.

390
00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:03,189
So there was something.

391
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:06,734
It was most bizarre.

392
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,570
I should explain that we come across

393
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:12,490
all sorts of conditions of men here.

394
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:13,950
Yet, the other night,

395
00:26:14,075 --> 00:26:16,035
I saw the most extraordinary creature

396
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,205
I have ever seen.

397
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,126
Not only had he a crooked back,

398
00:26:23,251 --> 00:26:25,378
but he was lame

399
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:29,007
and walked with his knees bent.

400
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,593
His face was darkly tanned,

401
00:26:31,718 --> 00:26:34,637
crinkled and puckered
like a withered apple.

402
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,306
I thought to myself that truly

403
00:26:36,431 --> 00:26:38,224
there are some of us on this earth

404
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:40,226
who are burdened with more than

405
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,354
their fair share of misfortune.

406
00:26:43,438 --> 00:26:45,940
This vision was made more unusual

407
00:26:46,065 --> 00:26:53,740
by the oriental garb
the man was wearing.

408
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:57,911
I pointed this person out to Nancy

409
00:26:57,994 --> 00:27:05,376
as someone especially
deserving of help.

410
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,130
Nancy had indeed been in
good spirits that evening,

411
00:27:09,255 --> 00:27:10,590
and I saw her go towards the man

412
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:18,515
and ask him if he needed assistance.

413
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,769
It was now that a change
came over Nancy.

414
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:25,230
She had begun a conversation with
the man when suddenly

415
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:28,608
all the color drained from her face.

416
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:32,111
She looked as though
she had seen a ghost.

417
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:34,489
The man, too, seemed to be
strangely affected

418
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:36,449
by the sight of her,

419
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,619
and I saw him gesticulating wildly.

420
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:42,455
Well, Nancy and the man
went to a quiet corner

421
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,250
of the hall and they talked together

422
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,668
for a few moments or so

423
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:48,962
before I heard an angry shout
from the man

424
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:53,758
and saw him storm out,
waving his fists in the air.

425
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,398
Nancy, what is it,

426
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:11,150
are you all right?

427
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:14,320
Who was that poor creature?

428
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:16,281
It's an old acquaintance of mine

429
00:28:16,364 --> 00:28:19,784
fallen on hard times.

430
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,578
Promise me, Annie,
you won't say anything

431
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:24,497
about this to anyone, promise me.

432
00:28:24,622 --> 00:28:33,298
Of course, I promise, if you so wish.

433
00:28:33,381 --> 00:28:36,801
And the identity of this man?

434
00:28:36,885 --> 00:28:39,804
I thought you might ask me that.

435
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:43,725
Well, after this terrible happening,
Nancy left.

436
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,602
I naturally made a few inquiries

437
00:28:45,727 --> 00:28:47,645
among some of the regulars;

438
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:50,398
such an unusual looking creature

439
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:53,234
has of course attracted attention.

440
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,322
It appears he is an old soldier
recently back from India,

441
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,073
and no one knows anything else

442
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:00,950
about his background

443
00:29:01,075 --> 00:29:02,911
except that he makes a living

444
00:29:03,036 --> 00:29:06,164
by entertaining the troops,
conjuring tricks,

445
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:10,460
that kind of thing.

446
00:29:10,585 --> 00:29:15,465
And did you tell the police about him?

447
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:23,348
Of course not, a promise is a promise.

448
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,059
Yes, of course.

449
00:29:26,142 --> 00:29:28,895
Thank you, Miss Morrison.

450
00:31:02,238 --> 00:31:06,284
That is our intruder's
four-footed companion.

451
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,620
It's a mongoose.

452
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:12,832
I think we've found our man.

453
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,928
Mr. Henry Wood, I believe,
late of India.

454
00:31:25,053 --> 00:31:26,429
May I have a word?

455
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:27,639
What about?

456
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:32,644
A little matter of Colonel
James Barclay's death.

457
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,610
She's innocent, you can take
my word for it.

458
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,112
Then you are guilty.

459
00:32:24,237 --> 00:32:28,074
No, I am not guilty.

460
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:31,703
Then who struck the Colonel down?

461
00:32:31,786 --> 00:32:34,372
It was a just Providence
that killed him,

462
00:32:34,455 --> 00:32:37,417
his own guilty conscience.

463
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,086
I think you'd better explain.

464
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:43,339
My God, if I had smashed his head in,

465
00:32:43,464 --> 00:32:44,757
as it was in my heart to do,

466
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:50,555
he would have got only what
he deserved from me.

467
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:55,435
No, I never laid a hand on him,

468
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,691
I was spared the trouble.

469
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:06,196
I'll tell you my story.

470
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:15,622
There is no cause for
me to be ashamed of it.

471
00:33:15,705 --> 00:33:24,172
You see me now with
my back like a camel,

472
00:33:24,297 --> 00:33:28,009
my ribs all awry,

473
00:33:28,134 --> 00:33:31,304
but there was a time when
Corporal Henry Wood

474
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:36,434
was the smartest man
in the Royal Mallows.

475
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:41,022
You were in the same regiment
as Colonel Barclay?

476
00:33:41,147 --> 00:33:49,864
Oh, yes, but he was
Sergeant Jim Barclay then.

477
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:53,409
We were in the same company,

478
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:59,833
and we had something else in common,

479
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:02,627
we were both in love

480
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:08,675
with the same woman, Nancy Devoy.

481
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,051
Who was the daughter

482
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:14,931
of the Regimental Sergeant Major.

483
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:20,979
There were two men who loved her,

484
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:30,989
but only one whom she loved.

485
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:41,374
She - you'll laugh when you look at

486
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:46,713
this poor thing huddled
in front of the fire

487
00:34:46,796 --> 00:34:56,389
and hear me say that it was
for my good looks

488
00:34:56,514 --> 00:35:04,189
that Nancy loved me.

489
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,623
I was the one she loved all along.

490
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:23,583
But although I had her heart,

491
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:30,924
her father didn't approve of me.

492
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:34,594
I was a harum-scarum,
reckless sort of lad,

493
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:40,475
but I was always honest and
plain dealing as well.

494
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,357
Oh, Nancy's father wanted her
to marry Barclay.

495
00:35:47,482 --> 00:35:49,609
He was careful to keep out of trouble,

496
00:35:49,692 --> 00:35:55,198
always did the right thing,

497
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:57,325
not like me who took Nancy

498
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,787
to places her father didn't like.

499
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:04,082
Besides, Barclay had had an education,

500
00:36:04,165 --> 00:36:06,793
he was already marked
for the sword-belt.

501
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:09,003
RSM Devoy naturally thought Barclay

502
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:16,845
the better match for his daughter.

503
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,181
But she remained true to me,

504
00:36:20,306 --> 00:36:21,641
and we would have married

505
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:24,102
had it not been for the Mutiny.

506
00:36:24,185 --> 00:36:29,023
Why did Nancy Devoy not marry
the man she loved?

507
00:36:29,148 --> 00:36:32,944
It was monsoon time in 1857,

508
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:36,823
when the Sepoys rose up
against the British.

509
00:36:36,948 --> 00:36:41,578
The regiment was shut up in Bhurtee.

510
00:36:41,703 --> 00:36:44,164
There were 10,000 rebels round us,

511
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:48,293
pinning us down like terriers
round a rat cage.

512
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,879
We'd run short of food and ammunition,

513
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:53,298
we had to communicate with
General Neill's column

514
00:36:53,381 --> 00:36:56,134
that was moving up-country.

515
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:59,095
It was our only chance to get help.

516
00:37:04,726 --> 00:37:07,061
Our company commander had asked
for a volunteer,

517
00:37:07,187 --> 00:37:09,981
a fit, strong soldier to slip out
of the garrison

518
00:37:10,064 --> 00:37:11,900
at dead of night and make contact

519
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:14,986
with the relief column out on
the plain beyond.

520
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,490
Like a fool, I volunteered.

521
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:20,658
It was a dangerous mission all right,

522
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:24,370
there were a 1,000 lives in peril.

523
00:37:24,496 --> 00:37:27,790
But I was thinking of
only one of them...

524
00:37:40,595 --> 00:37:42,889
Nancy Devoy,

525
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:45,058
the woman I loved, and the finest girl

526
00:37:45,141 --> 00:37:49,103
that ever had the breath of life
between her lips.

527
00:37:49,187 --> 00:37:57,070
Saying goodbye to her was
the hardest thing.

528
00:37:57,153 --> 00:38:01,241
As we exchanged mementos,
I never thought that

529
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:04,369
I was saying goodbye to her
for 30 years.

530
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:09,666
It was my rival for Nancy's hand

531
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,376
who saw me off on my journey

532
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:13,378
through the enemy lines that night,

533
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,547
Sergeant Barclay.

534
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,131
He said he knew the lie of the land

535
00:38:17,257 --> 00:38:19,217
around the garrison
better than any other.

536
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,553
While I volunteered to make the journey,

537
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:23,847
Jim Barclay volunteered to advise me

538
00:38:23,972 --> 00:38:28,268
on the best route to take.

539
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:36,109
So, just after then,

540
00:38:36,192 --> 00:38:38,820
while my comrades gave me
covering fire,

541
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:42,407
I set off.

542
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:47,996
Barclay had told me to follow a stream

543
00:38:48,121 --> 00:38:49,622
which would lead to a gully.

544
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:53,209
This, he said,
was the safest way downhill.

545
00:38:53,334 --> 00:38:54,794
His directions were perfect

546
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:56,713
and soon I was wading
through icy water

547
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:01,801
that only the day before
had been snow in the Himalayas.

548
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:12,478
I could see the lights and fires
in the rebels' camp

549
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:14,105
but I kept well down,

550
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:16,482
out of sight of their sentry posts.

551
00:39:16,608 --> 00:39:19,319
I came to the gully and
thought I was safe.

552
00:39:25,658 --> 00:39:28,661
Then it happened, I was attacked.

553
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:31,080
Something hard cracked down
on my head

554
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:36,920
and everything spun around.

555
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:40,965
When I came to,
I was trussed up like a chicken

556
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:43,301
and hanging from a tree.

557
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:45,678
My arms felt as though
they were being wrenched

558
00:39:45,762 --> 00:39:48,431
out of their sockets.

559
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:51,768
I didn't mind the pain,
but I was sick at heart

560
00:39:51,893 --> 00:39:54,646
for having failed in my mission.

561
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:56,814
What would be the fate of those

562
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:59,526
I had been trying to save?

563
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,538
But the biggest blow came as I listened

564
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:15,583
to what I could understand
of a rebels' talk.

565
00:40:15,708 --> 00:40:19,379
I heard enough to realize
that I had been betrayed.

566
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:21,548
The very man who had
shown me the way to take

567
00:40:21,673 --> 00:40:23,967
had betrayed me to the enemy.

568
00:40:24,092 --> 00:40:26,135
Barclay had got rid of me

569
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:28,721
to make sure he could have my girl.

570
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:43,653
Now, you know what James Barclay
was capable of.

571
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:48,283
Well, it turned out that
General Neill's column

572
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:51,870
was already on its way
to relieve Bhurtee.

573
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,372
The rebels retreated,

574
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:57,709
they dragged me away with them.

575
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,919
I was tortured.

576
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:06,634
I tried to escape, I was tortured again.

577
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:09,596
It was to be many a long year

578
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,515
before I saw another white face.

579
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:21,482
My captors fled north,
further into the hills,

580
00:41:21,608 --> 00:41:24,694
and used me as a sort of slave.

581
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:26,404
I was treated worse than a dog

582
00:41:26,488 --> 00:41:31,034
and they damn near broke
every bone in my body.

583
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:34,871
Sometimes I'd wish
they'd just killed me,

584
00:41:34,996 --> 00:41:37,123
but my thoughts of hatred and
loathing for the man

585
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:39,959
who destroyed my life kept me going.

586
00:41:40,043 --> 00:41:44,130
I dreamed of revenge on Barclay.

587
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,772
One day some Afghan tribesmen

588
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:03,775
murdered the rebels
that held me prisoner.

589
00:42:03,858 --> 00:42:05,860
They left me for dead, too.

590
00:42:05,985 --> 00:42:08,947
But by a miracle, I still lived.

591
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:20,500
So, I had my revenge on my torturers,

592
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:24,045
but Barclay was beyond my grasp.

593
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,089
And what of Nancy,

594
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:28,508
I had no means of knowing whether
she was alive or dead.

595
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:35,849
I wandered back to the Punjab,

596
00:42:35,974 --> 00:42:38,142
and lived among the natives,

597
00:42:38,226 --> 00:42:40,728
picking up a living
by the conjuring tricks

598
00:42:40,812 --> 00:42:43,481
I'd learned from the street magicians.

599
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:46,442
What use was it for me,
a wretched cripple,

600
00:42:46,568 --> 00:42:49,529
to get passage back by ship to England

601
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:53,908
and make myself known
to my old comrades in the regiment?

602
00:42:54,033 --> 00:42:59,539
Even my desire to have my revenge
on Jim Barclay didn't make me go.

603
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:03,710
No, I - I'll tell you straight,

604
00:43:03,835 --> 00:43:06,421
I preferred my Nancy and my old pals

605
00:43:06,546 --> 00:43:09,716
in the Royal Mallows to go on believing

606
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:12,927
that Harry Wood died a hero's death

607
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,180
with a straight back,

608
00:43:15,263 --> 00:43:18,683
than see him crawling about the world

609
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:26,357
more like a chimpanzee
than a human being.

610
00:43:26,441 --> 00:43:28,401
But you did return,

611
00:43:28,485 --> 00:43:32,030
and to Aldershot where your old
regiment was stationed, why?

612
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:36,743
I just wanted to see the old country
once more before I died.

613
00:43:36,868 --> 00:43:46,002
I saved what I could and
eventually I got a ship.

614
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:55,386
I didn't know the regiment was
stationed here in Aldershot,

615
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,139
I just wanted to be where
there were soldiers.

616
00:43:58,264 --> 00:44:00,600
I could earn my keep
going around the canteens

617
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:05,355
doing my tricks to entertain them.

618
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,108
I no longer wanted to kill Barclay,

619
00:44:09,234 --> 00:44:11,110
the fires of revenge

620
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:17,617
had burned low over the years...

621
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:25,583
until I saw her.

622
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:37,178
I thought I'd better get
some English tongs,

623
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,472
I looked comical enough
without wearing

624
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:42,392
these foreign clothes the whole time.

625
00:44:42,517 --> 00:44:44,853
At first, I was more interested
in finding

626
00:44:44,978 --> 00:44:47,313
a thick overcoat than
looking at the charity

627
00:44:47,397 --> 00:44:50,358
ladies who were doling them out.

628
00:44:50,441 --> 00:44:55,196
Then one of them came over,

629
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:59,784
I recognized her at once,

630
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:06,040
she'd hardly changed, still beautiful.

631
00:45:06,166 --> 00:45:09,127
What's more amazing is she -

632
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,964
she seemed to know me.

633
00:45:13,047 --> 00:45:14,841
Good evening, can I help you?

634
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:23,516
Have you been able to
find anything that -

635
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,686
I'm sorry, I thought I...

636
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:32,942
Nancy, it is me, Harry.

637
00:45:33,067 --> 00:45:36,696
Don't be afraid.

638
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:42,243
I thought you had been dead
these 30 years.

639
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:44,829
I have been...

640
00:45:44,913 --> 00:45:54,756
I thought I would never see you again.

641
00:46:00,345 --> 00:46:03,848
We spoke for a moment or two together.

642
00:46:03,973 --> 00:46:08,853
I told her some of my story.

643
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,438
I should have spared telling her

644
00:46:10,563 --> 00:46:11,898
that her husband was a traitor

645
00:46:11,981 --> 00:46:15,068
but it all came pouring out of me,

646
00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:21,908
30 years of hate.

647
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:26,579
She was so effected by what I said,

648
00:46:26,704 --> 00:46:29,707
I couldn't stand it.

649
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:33,962
I went outside,

650
00:46:34,087 --> 00:46:37,423
then I saw her come out of the mission

651
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:40,343
and I followed her home.

652
00:46:40,468 --> 00:46:47,141
I saw her go into the house,
a light came on.

653
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:55,650
I saw her sitting in a chair.

654
00:46:55,733 --> 00:46:59,946
And then he came into the room.

655
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:03,324
James, I have to talk to you.

656
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:05,076
Why are you locking that door.

657
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,494
Don't be back late, I said,

658
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:07,579
don't be back late, didn't I?

659
00:47:07,704 --> 00:47:09,164
You've been with someone.

660
00:47:09,289 --> 00:47:10,081
No -

661
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:11,207
You have been with someone.

662
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:12,667
No -

663
00:47:12,792 --> 00:47:14,794
Who is it?

664
00:47:14,919 --> 00:47:19,716
...you've ruined my life.

665
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:24,721
All these years, all these years.

666
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:27,807
Oh, how could you do such a thing -

667
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:29,434
Mrs. Barclay, your tea.

668
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:30,685
- it was evil.

669
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:33,813
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you.

670
00:47:33,938 --> 00:47:35,648
No-

671
00:47:35,773 --> 00:47:37,901
To see him lay a hand on her

672
00:47:38,026 --> 00:47:39,819
made me mad with anger.

673
00:47:39,903 --> 00:47:41,321
My feelings overcame me -

674
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:42,489
David -

675
00:47:42,614 --> 00:47:43,490
Your tea, madam.

676
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:45,158
David, you betrayed him.

677
00:47:45,283 --> 00:47:46,659
It's not true.

678
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:50,163
But he's alive, I tell you,
I've seen him.

679
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:53,291
You're lying, you're mad.

680
00:48:06,346 --> 00:48:09,557
He looked as I have never seen
a man look.

681
00:48:09,682 --> 00:48:14,646
I read death on his face
as plain as anything.

682
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:17,232
The bare sight of me was like a bullet

683
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:23,822
through his guilty heart.

684
00:48:23,947 --> 00:48:28,743
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay,
open the door.

685
00:48:28,868 --> 00:48:31,287
He smashed onto the fender.

686
00:48:31,412 --> 00:48:35,208
He was dead before he fell.

687
00:48:52,308 --> 00:48:57,021
Mrs. Barclay, Mrs. Barclay,
open the door.

688
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,325
I took the key to the door
from Nancy's hand,

689
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,452
intending to open it and get help.

690
00:49:11,578 --> 00:49:13,121
I thought I'd better get away

691
00:49:13,246 --> 00:49:15,206
or things might look black against me.

692
00:49:15,331 --> 00:49:17,876
In haste, I thrust the key
into my pocket

693
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:19,294
whilst I was chasing Teddy,

694
00:49:19,419 --> 00:49:21,588
who'd escaped from his box and
run up a curtain.

695
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:25,717
Teddy.

696
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,847
So, the Colonel died before

697
00:49:30,972 --> 00:49:33,766
he struck his head on the fender?

698
00:49:33,892 --> 00:49:37,645
An apoplectic fit, brought on by shock.

699
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,773
Mr. Wood, provided the
coroner reaches

700
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:43,568
the same conclusion, Mrs. Barclay -

701
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:48,490
Nancy.

702
00:49:48,615 --> 00:49:52,327
- will be free.

703
00:49:52,452 --> 00:49:53,953
I trust you would have no objection

704
00:49:54,078 --> 00:49:55,955
to repeating your story to the police,

705
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,960
should the need arise?

706
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:06,841
Mr. Holmes, how is Nancy?

707
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:09,177
She's in hospital.

708
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:12,931
I understand in time she should
make a complete recovery.

709
00:50:13,014 --> 00:50:15,725
Thank God.

710
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:47,382
Hello, Ann, how lovely to see you.

711
00:50:47,507 --> 00:50:48,758
Are you better?

712
00:50:48,883 --> 00:50:49,843
Yes, I'm much better.

713
00:50:56,057 --> 00:50:58,810
Holmes, there's just one thing
I don't understand.

714
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:02,021
If the Colonel's name was James,

715
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:05,108
and Wood was called
either Henry or Harry,

716
00:51:05,233 --> 00:51:08,027
then who the deuce was David?

717
00:51:08,153 --> 00:51:09,445
My dear Watson,

718
00:51:09,571 --> 00:51:11,531
that name David should have told me

719
00:51:11,656 --> 00:51:14,033
the whole story had I been
the ideal reasoner,

720
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,244
which you are so fond of depicting.

721
00:51:16,369 --> 00:51:18,913
But alas, my powers of deduction failed.

722
00:51:19,038 --> 00:51:21,124
You see, David, in this case,

723
00:51:21,249 --> 00:51:24,460
was evidently used as
a term of reproach.

724
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:27,172
Reproach?

725
00:51:27,255 --> 00:51:29,048
Don't you remember how King David

726
00:51:29,174 --> 00:51:31,885
sent Uriah the Hittite
into the forefront

727
00:51:31,968 --> 00:51:34,053
of the battle to die so that he might

728
00:51:34,179 --> 00:51:36,681
steal his woman, Bathsheba?

729
00:51:36,764 --> 00:51:39,475
I think you will find the story

730
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:43,480
in the first or second book of Samuel.

731
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:46,149
My old testament is a little rusty.

732
00:51:56,534 --> 00:51:58,328
You're quite right, Holmes,

733
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:03,625
Il Samuel, 11:14-17.

734
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:07,170
You appear to have looked it up yourself

735
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:12,300
since we returned home from Aldershot.

736
00:52:12,425 --> 00:52:17,430
How did you know?

737
00:52:17,555 --> 00:52:19,641
You used this bill for our meal

738
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:21,976
at Waterloo as a bookmarker,
did you not?

739
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:25,396
Excellent, Watson.

740
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:31,903
Elementary, my dear Holmes.

741
00:52:31,986 --> 00:52:37,408
Goodnight, old fellow.
