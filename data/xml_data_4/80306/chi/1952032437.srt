1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,960
是, 大臣 第1季第3集

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,000
节约运动

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,200
看过了?
You've read it?

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,000
看了
I've read it.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,080
看这个了吗?
Have you read this?

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,000
他看了
He's read it.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,960
我念给你听
Let me read it to you

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,160
我们看过了
We've read it.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,800
"把吉姆・哈克辞退"
"Let's get rid of Jim Hacker",

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,360
特别调查员约翰・皮尔格里姆撰稿
by John Pilgrim special investigator.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,680
吉姆・哈克议员阁下
The Right Honourable Jim Jacker MP,

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,600
曾承诺履行政府提出的
promised to carry out the government's plans

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
精简行政机构的计划
to slim down the Civil Service, listen,

16
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,080
清除来自白厅及市政厅
to wipe out the interference from the Whitehall and

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,480
好事之人的干扰
Town Hall busybodies.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,280
但有多少人意识到 举例来说
But how many people realise that to take one example

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,000
在国税局工作的人甚至比
more people serve in the Inland Revenue

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,520
在皇家海军服役的人还多?
than the Royal Navy?

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,440
真的吗?      确有其事 大臣
Is it true?  I believe it is, Minister.

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,920
"也许政府认为
"Perhaps the government thinks

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
征税才是最佳的国防"     还挺幽默的
that a tax is the best form of defence". That's rather witty.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,280
这段你看过了吗?       看过了
And have you read this bit? I have read it.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
"我发现至少有四个部门
"I have discovered that no less than four ministries

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
负责同一种陆军制服的供应
check the supply of the same army uniforms.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,120
国防部检查是否收到了所订货物
The Ministry Defence checks to see they get what they ordered.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
而工业部检查
But the Department of Industry

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,640
这些服装的生产
checks to see they have been manufactured

30
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,280
是否符合政府标准
according to government regulations.

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
财政部检查款项 而吉姆・哈克那伙人
The Treasury checks the bills. And Jim Hacker's mob

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,520
只是监督其他所有人
just checks up on everyone else.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,080
吉姆・哈克本人就是白厅冗员繁多
Jim Hacker is the most obvious case

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,320
最明显的例子
of overmanning in Whitehall.

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,640
让我们首先把他辞退 至少可以省下一份薪水"
Let's start by getting rid of him and save at least one salary".

36
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,800
弗兰克 干吗要念给我听 我告诉你我看过了
Frank, why did you read me that? I told you I'd read it.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
因为我是你的政治顾问
Because I'm yourpolitical advisor.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
你有没有意识到 这在政治上会有多大的破坏性?
Do you realise how politically damaging for you.

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,000
早上好 大臣
Good morning, Minister.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,000
你看了吗?
Have you read this?

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,920
看了 看了 看了
Yes Yes Yes

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,640
我看过了 我看过了
I have read it I have read it,

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
你看过了 他也看过了
You have read it, he has read it

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,760
我们都他妈看过了
We have all bloody read it,

45
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,280
我说得还不清楚吗?
do I make myself clear?

46
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,120
再清楚不过了 大臣
Abundantly, Minister.

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,440
很抱歉 坐
I'm sorry. Sit down.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,000
汉弗莱 我们必须精简公务员
Humphrey, we have got to slim down the Civil Service.

49
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,840
我们部门里有多少人?
Howmany people have we got in this department?

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,960
这个部门吗? 哦 我们部很小的
This department? Oh, we're very small.

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,320
小? 有多小?
Small? How small?

52
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,280
不知道...     2千人?
I don't know...    2.000?

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
3千?
3.000?

54
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,480
我想 大概2万3千人吧 大臣
about 23.000 I think, Minister.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,800
2万3千人?
23.000?

56
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,120
就我们行政事务部?
In the Department of Administrative Affairs?

57
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,400
这2万3千人都在管理其他行政人员?
23.000 people just administering other administrators?

58
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,480
我们得研究一下体制和工作方法 看看哪些是冗员
We'll have to do a study to see who we can get rid of.

59
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,840
去年我们倒是研究过 大臣阁下       结果呢?
We did one of those last year, minister.And?

60
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,280
结果表明我们还需要再增加五百人
It transpired we needed another 500 people.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,840
不过 大臣阁下 我们可以关闭
However, we could always close

62
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,760
您那个政府部门监察办公室
your Bureaucratic Watchdog Office.

63
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,440
这可不行 这才刚刚成立
No, you don't. The office just opened.

64
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,480
这可是我上任以来做的唯一事情
It's the one thing I've done since I got here.

65
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,640
随便您 大臣 不过那早已为人诟病
But as you wish minster, it has been criticised

66
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,040
被称作好事者的信箱      我知道
as a trouble maker's letterbox. I know.

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
不过 在选民中倒很受欢迎 汉弗莱
It's very popular with the voters Humphrey

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,600
这能让我们找到方法
This is a chance to help us find ways

69
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
杜绝浪费政府资金
to stop wasting government money.

70
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,320
可公众又不懂挥霍
But public doesn't know anthing about wasting

71
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,240
公家钱财的事 我们才是专家
government money. We are the experts.

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
我可不是这个意思
That's not what I meant.

73
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,800
总之 监察办公室要保留下来
Well, the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office stays.

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,720
这样的话 我一时也想不出什么建议了
Well, offhand I can't think of what else to suggest.

75
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,440
你是在认真地跟我说
Are you seriously telling me that

76
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,480
我们没有办法精简人员吗?
there is no way we can cut down?

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
我想我们可以裁掉一两个端茶小姐
I suppose we could lose one or two of the tea ladies.

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,960
别闹了 汉弗莱
Oh, Humphrey,

79
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,080
我确实希望你能端正下态度
I do wish you'd take this seriously.

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,720
端茶小姐 我要的是事实
Tea ladies I want the facts.

81
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,040
我要知道谁在这儿工作 都干些什么工作
I want to know who works here, what they do,

82
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,880
我们有哪些楼 里面的人都在干什么
what buildings we have, what goes on in them.

83
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,400
完整的记录
And comlete record.

84
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,120
然后就能知道哪儿该节省开支
Then we'll know where to cut costs,

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,440
裁减人员 简化程序了
cut staff, cut procedures...

86
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,040
大臣 公务员系统
The Civil Service, Minister,

87
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,280
就是为了贯彻议会颁布的法律而存在的
exists to implement legislation enacted by Parliament.

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,320
只要议会还在立法
As long as Parliament continues to legislate,

89
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
行政机构...
the Civil Service...

90
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,680
不过 我完全理解您的要求 大臣
However, I am fully seized of your requirements, minister.

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,320
请允许我这就去让程序转起来
and if you excuse me I'll go and set the wheels in motion.

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,400
谢谢
Thank you.

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,800
早上好 威瑟尔(黄鼠狼)先生
Good morning, Mr. Weasel.

94
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,080
埃瑟尔
Weisel.

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,160
你知道吗 一个西北地区区长
Did you know that a northwest Regional Controller

96
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,840
仅在他的区域就削减了三千两百万英镑的开支
has achieved cuts of 32 million pounds in his region alone?

97
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,840
而行政机构却把这消息给压了下去
And that the Civil Service is suppressing the story?

98
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,720
真的吗?      要是真的 就太惊人了
Is it true? Well if it is, I'm aghast

99
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,840
为什么要压制消息?
Why does it suppress news?

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,120
因为他做得到的话 那别人也不得不节约了
Because if he can save money,everyone else will have to do it.

101
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,360
你何不调查一下
Why don't you look into it,

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,400
做个雪貂 四处打探(ferret:雪貂/打探)
have a bit of a ferret around?

103
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,520
你觉得我可以吗?
Do you think I could?

104
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,560
我觉得主意不错
I think that's a very good idea,

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,600
雪貂 哦不对 威瑟…埃瑟尔先生
Mr. Ferret erWeasel.     Hey

106
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,560
他告诉你是三千二百万英镑?
He told you 32 million pounds?

107
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,000
是的 汉弗莱爵士     我太震惊了
Yes, Sir Humphrey.     I'm aghast

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,840
我也是
So was I.

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
我们居然不知道 太不可思议了
It's incredible we didn't know about it.

110
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,520
我早就知道了
I knew about it.

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
那您震惊什么?
Then why are you aghast?

112
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,200
我震惊是因为消息泄漏了
I'm aghast that it got out.

113
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,760
明年或许财政部不会给我们那么多钱了
We might get less money from the Treasury next year.

114
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,960
哦 五点半已经过了 来杯雪利酒?
Oh, it's afterhalf past five. Sherry?

115
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,640
呃 嗯 好的 谢谢
Oh, er, yes. Thank you.

116
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,400
你看起来还是很担心 伯纳德
You still look worried, Bernard.

117
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,600
嗯 是的
Well... yes.

118
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,480
我的意思是 当然我们想要省钱
I mean, surely we want to save money.

119
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,760
伯纳德 你很清楚
Bernard, You know perfectly well

120
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,920
公务员系统必定要有
there has to be some way

121
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,040
某种衡量其成就的方法
to measure success in the Civil Service.

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,200
英国利兰汽车衡量成功的标准
British Leyland measure their success

123
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,960
是盈利了多少
by the size of their profits,

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
或者 更准确地说
or, to be more accurate,

125
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,880
他们衡量失败的标准是亏损了多少
they measure their failure by the size of their losses.

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,600
可我们不盈利 也不亏损
We don't have profits and losses.

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,040
我们的成就是靠
We have to measure our success

128
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,600
雇员人数和预算的多少来衡量的
by the size of our staff and our budget.

129
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,840
明白地说 伯纳德
By definition, Bernard,

130
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,720
庞大的部门比小部门更有成就
a big department is more successful than a small one.

131
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,640
你是不是说那名西北地区区长
Are you saying that the northwest Regional Controller

132
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,520
省下那么多钱是在做傻事?
boobed by saving so much money?

133
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,160
当然 谁也没让他这么做
Well, of course. Nobody asked him to.

134
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840
要是人人都如此
Suppose everybody did it

135
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,320
要是所有人都开始
Suppose everyone went around saving money

136
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
不负责任地到处省钱
irresponsibly all over the place.

137
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,680
大臣正有此意 不是吗?
That's what the Minister wants, isn't it?

138
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,520
坐下 伯纳德
Do sit down, Bernard.

139
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,680
大臣们就像走马灯更换无常
Ministers come and Ministers go.

140
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,040
任何部门的大臣
The average Minister lasts less

141
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,920
平均任期都不到十一个月
than 11 months in any department.

142
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,320
听着 伯纳德 我们责无旁贷地
You see, Bernard, it is our duty

143
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,360
应协助大臣争取部门经费
to assist the Minister to fight for the Department's money

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,200
即便他自己担惊受怕
despite his own panic reactions.

145
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,320
你是说帮他克服恐慌
You mean help him overcome his panic.

146
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
不 不 不
No. No. No.

147
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,760
我们任他惊慌失措
No, we must let him panic.

148
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
政治家乐意惊惶失措 他们需要活动
Politicians like to panic. They need activity.

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
他们以此来代替成就
It's their substitute for achievement.

150
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,360
我们必须确保一切照旧
We must just ensure that it doesn't change anything.

151
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
可他们是民众的代表
But they are the people's representatives,

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
是民主选举的结果
democratically chosen.

153
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,120
议员又不是人民的选择
MP's aren't chosen by the people,

154
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,960
而是其所在地党派决定的
they are chosen by their local party.

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,120
是由35个穿着邋遢雨衣的男人
35 men in grubby raincoats

156
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
或是35个戴着愚蠢礼帽的女人
or 35 women in silly hats.

157
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
可内阁成员来自他们中最优秀的人
And the government are selected from the best of them.

158
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,720
伯纳德
Bernard,

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,760
下院议员仅有630位
there are only 630 MP's.

160
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,360
一个党派超过300名席位便组成内阁
If one party has just over 300 it forms a government.

161
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,800
这300人中 有100名冥顽老朽
Of that 300, one hundred are too old and too silly,

162
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,080
还有100名乳臭未干
one hundred too young and too callow

163
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,640
剩下的大约100名下院议员
which leaves just about a hundred MP's

164
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,760
便填上了100个政府职务
to fill 100 governmental posts.

165
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,080
根本无从挑选
There's no choice al all.

166
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,640
他们未经甄别 未受训练
They've had no selection, no training.

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,680
我们不得不为他们代劳
We have to do the job for them.

168
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,120
但节省3千2百万开支的事
But how can we explain saving 32 million pounds

169
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
如何向大臣解释?
to the Minister?

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,280
我们可以声称
We can explain they've changed

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
西北的账目体系有了改变
their accounting systems in the northwest.

172
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,200
或者各区的管辖范围经过重新划分
Or that they've redrawn the regional boundaries

173
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,120
现在的数据已经没有意义了
so that the current figures aren't operable.

174
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,080
一切皆有可能
There are all sorts of possibilities.

175
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,840
明白了
I see.

176
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
有益的交谈 伯纳德
Useful chat, Bernard,

177
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,560
记住这从未发生过
good job it never took place.

178
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,920
是的 当然没有
Yes. Yes. Of course.

179
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,280
我们的朋友威瑟尔上哪去了?
So what else is our friend Weasel up to?

180
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,800
他在当雪貂
Oh, he's ferretting.

181
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,880
当雪貂? 哪儿?
Ferretting? Where?

182
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,240
四处打探
It's a roving brief.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,880
看来我们不得不给侦查员安排辆政府用车了
Then we shall have to provide Rover with a government car.

184
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,120
便于了解他在哪儿打洞了
So that we'll know where he's digging.

185
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,080
你…
How...

186
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,640
跟你的大臣磨合的怎样了 小汉?
how are you getting on with your Minister, Humpy?

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,520
还没把那节约的事控制住?
Got this economising no sense under control?

188
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,640
是的 控制住了 巨人 或多或少
Yes, I think so, Jumbo... more or less.

189
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,480
"或多或少"什么意思?
What do you mean more or less?

190
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
好吧 既是又不是
Well... yes and no.

191
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,080
大概与所有其他的政府节约一样吧?
Presumably it's like all the other government economy drives?

192
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,560
三天的新闻发布 三周的内阁备忘录
Three days of press releases,three weeks of memos,

193
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,520
中东发生危机 一切恢复正常?
a crisis in the Middle East and back to normal?

194
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,000
这次稍有不同
This one's slightly different.

195
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
恐怕他是要把
I'm afraid He's beginning to see

196
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,320
裁剪公务员视为首要任务了
slimming down the Service as his main task.

197
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,680
该死的 我们无须瘦身
Dammit, we don't need slimming

198
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,280
我想你或许应该
I think you might have to conduct

199
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,440
再来一个"自讨苦吃行动"
another Operation Hair Shirt.

200
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,560
自讨苦吃行动
Operation Hair Shirt.

201
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,160
明智的主意
What a good idea.

202
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,720
引领他感受痛苦的个人节约
Guide him towards painful personal economies.

203
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,760
就是这样 你知道
Yes, you know.

204
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,920
"节约应从'我'做起 大臣阁下"
"Economy begins at home, Minister".

205
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,840
"要树立表率 大臣阁下"
"Set an example, Minister".

206
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,320
"我们必须身体力行才能令人信服 大臣阁下"
"Can't expect others to do what we can't do ourselves, Minister".

207
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,520
对极了 这正是他需要的 自我否定
Yes, yes. Just what he needs, self denial.

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,400
了不起
Splendid.

209
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,720
好 第3项 节约运动
Right. Item 3. The economy drive.

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,040
有关我们的铺张浪费 弗兰克提供了
Frank has come up with some really startling indications

211
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,800
一些让人震惊的信息
of wastage in our very midst.

212
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,920
他核实过了?
Has he confirmed?

213
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,400
我想我揭露的事实准会让你大吃一惊的
And I think you gonna be pretty surprised of what I uncovered

214
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,640
我得说 汉弗莱
And I must say Hamphrey

215
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
这些事实看来是对
These facts are a frightening indictment

216
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,720
官僚作风与自我放纵的可怕谴责
of bureaucratic sloppiness and self indulgence.

217
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
天哪 天哪
Dear, yeah.

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,880
但如你所见
But as you'll see,

219
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,080
这倒是给我们提供了巨大的空间
they do give us enormous scope

220
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,120
来大刀阔斧地开展节约运动
for some really dramatic economies.

221
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,600
令人期待
Good show

222
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,760
两份报告 一份关于人力资源 一份办公楼
Two files, one on manpower, one on buildings.

223
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
从办公楼开始吧
Let's start with the buildings.

224
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,720
查德威克大厦 西奥德利街
Chadwick House, West Audley Street.

225
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,960
巨大的建筑 但办公的人却寥寥无几
A huge building only a handful of people working there.

226
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,520
是啊 20人
Yes, 20...

227
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,360
抱歉 我恰好清楚查德威克大厦的情况
I'm so sorry. I do happen to know about Chadwick House.

228
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,520
你了解些什么?
What do you know?

229
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,160
很显然眼下没有充分利用
It's obviously underused at the most,

230
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,400
但它已被指定为
but it's the destinite office

231
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,680
新成立的环境署办公楼
for the new Commission for the Environment.

232
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,040
我们还说不准它是否
And we're actually wondering

233
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,800
足够容纳所有的工作人员
if it's going to be big enough for all the staff.

234
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,240
好吧
O.K.

235
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,080
那么位于沃森斯道的雷迪史密斯大厦呢?
What about Ladysmith Buildings, Walthamstow.

236
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,480
那可是完全空着     理应如此
Apparently that's empty. Of course.

237
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,680
你的"理应如此"的意思是?
What do you mean, of course?

238
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,480
出于安全考虑 大臣 我不能多言
Security, minister. I can say no more.

239
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,000
你是指军情六处?
Do you mean Ml6?

240
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,960
这又是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

241
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,960
我们不承认有军情六处这回事
We do not admit that Ml6 exists.

242
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
谁不知道它的存在
Everybody knows it exists.

243
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,000
即便如此 我们不能承认
Nevertheless, we do not admit it.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,320
这桌子旁坐着的人并非都是经过检疫的
Not everyone round this table has been vetted.

245
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,120
对猫才用"检疫"这个词吧
I thought that was something you do cats.

246
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,560
确实如此 对"雪貂"就不用 大臣阁下
Yes, indeed. But not ferrets, Minister.

247
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,120
雷迪史密斯大厦是最高机密
Ladysmith House is top secret.

248
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,800
沃森斯道上七层的大厦怎么会是最高机密?
How can a sevenstorey building in Walthamstow tobe top secret?

249
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,400
有志者事竟成
Where there's a will there's a way.

250
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,640
那惠灵顿大厦和威斯敏斯特旧厅呢?
What about Wellington House and Westminster Old Hall?

251
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,080
惠灵顿大厦 位于海德公园大道
Wellington House, Hyde Park Road,

252
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,800
价值七百五十万英镑
estimated value 7.5 million pounds.

253
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,760
威斯敏斯特旧厅 位于萨克维尔广场
Westminster Old Hall, Sackville Square,

254
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,400
价值一千一百万英镑
estimated value 11 million pounds.

255
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,880
两幢办公楼里的员工都不多
Each building with a tiny staff,

256
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
却都摆满了档案柜
and both filled entirely with filing cabinets.

257
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,360
请问这些估价的根据是?
May I ask the source of these valuations?

258
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,080
办公用房的市价
Going rate for property.

259
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,960
但它们没一个能卖到这个现行价格
But neither of these properties would fetch the going rate.

260
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,600
为什么不能?
Why not?

261
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,040
惠灵顿大厦既没有防火梯 也没有防火门
Wellington House has no fire escape or fire doors

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,720
而大厦的构造也不容改建
and the building wouldn't stand the alteration.

263
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
不能当作办公楼
It can't be used as offices.

264
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,800
那你是如何用上这幢大厦的?    是啊
How are you able to use them?

265
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,000
政府办公楼无须防火安全通道
Government buildings do not require fire safety clearance.

266
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,400
为何不用?
Why not?

267
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
可能是女王陛下的公仆们
Well, perhaps because Her Majesty's Civil Servants

268
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,920
不容易着急上火吧
are not easily inflamed.

269
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,800
希望如此
I hope it is right.

270
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,040
那威斯敏斯特旧厅呢?
What about Westminster Old Hall?

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,880
一级保护建筑
Class one Registered Building.

272
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,280
不能改变当前房屋使用人
Can't change current user designation.

273
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,720
好吧 比肯斯菲尔德街上的3到17号大楼呢?
I see. 3 to 17 Beaconsfield Street?

274
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,040
对 是了 该建筑现在有了三层的
Ah, yes. Now that has a three-level

275
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,520
钢筋混凝土地下室
reinforced concrete basement.

276
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,120
这又怎么了?
So?

277
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,000
防患于未然
It is there in case.

278
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,880
防什么患?
In case?

279
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
您知道的 大臣
Well, you know, Minister.

280
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,440
那是政府应急总部 以防万一的
Emergency Government Headquarters, if and when.

281
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,240
万一怎么了?
If and when what?

282
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,600
万一... 您明白
If and when... you know what.

283
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,640
什么?
What?

284
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,080
您明白的那个万一
If and when you know what.

285
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,800
我不明白 是什么?
I don't know what. What?

286
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:15,920
什么
What?

287
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,680
你那句"您明白的那个万一"是什么意思?
What do you mean, if and when you know what?

288
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,520
大臣 万一危机来临
Minister, when the chips are down,

289
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,960
局势动荡 吹灯拔蜡...
and the balloons are up and the lights go out...

290
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,520
政府也得有个地方继续运行啊
There has to be somewhere to carry on government,

291
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,640
即便一切都陷入瘫痪
even if everything else stops.

292
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,400
为什么?
Why?

293
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
难道国家被摧毁了
The government just stops just because

294
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,920
内阁就该偃旗息鼓吗?
the whole country's been destroyed.

295
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,520
毁于一旦已经够糟了
Annihilation's bad enough,

296
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,000
无政府状态只会雪上加霜
without anarchy to make things even worse.

297
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,880
你是说还有许多反叛的余孽?
you mean a lot of rebellions cinders?

298
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,080
没错
That's right.

299
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,680
到那时你还指望管理谁?
Who would be there for you to govern?

300
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,920
肯定还会有些普通民众
Well, some ordinary people around.

301
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,200
那中央户籍登记处的那幢楼呢?
What about central registry?

302
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
没有建筑许可
No planning permission.

303
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,320
他怎么什么都知道?
How did he know always?

304
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,040
你早就知道我去哪儿了?
You knew where I'd been.

305
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,920
我们当然知道他去过哪
Obviously we knew where he'd been.

306
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,560
难不成他本该暗中打探吗?
Why, was he supposed to be spying?

307
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,520
我们信奉公开调查 不是吗?
We do believe in open enquiries, don't we?

308
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,120
我们看看人力资源方面
Let us turn to manpower.

309
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
对 我们看看
Yes, let's

310
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,720
在散德兰就有90名公务员
Aparently there are 90 Civil Servants

311
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,680
明显在重复白厅这儿
in Sunderland except the duplicating the work

312
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,280
另外90个人从事的工作
of 90 more here in Whitehall.

313
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,720
对了 这源于内阁的一项决定
That stems from a Cabinet decision,

314
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,480
为东北地区创造就业机会      把这些人裁了吧
job creation in the northeast.Let's get rid of them.

315
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,080
对 一下子就裁掉了90名公务员
We'd get rid of 90 Civil Servants at a stroke.

316
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,560
是啊 或是一下子就引起了一场罢工     对 什么?
Yes, or indeed, at a strike.      Yes. What?

317
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,400
个人而言 我完全
Well, personally I would be hope heartily

318
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,160
赞成这个行动 大臣阁下
in favour of such a move, minister.

319
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
这会是一场辉煌的节约运动
It would be a splendid economy.

320
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,560
在一个萧条的边缘选区裁员
And show great political courage to sack staff

321
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,680
会展现出极大的政治魄力
in depressed marginal constituencies.

322
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,480
我就是不信
I just don't believe it that

323
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,400
没有可节约之处 浪费明明随处可见
There is nowhere we can cut down. I see waste everywhere.

324
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
我同意您的话 大臣阁下
Well I agree with you, Minister.

325
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,000
确有可节约之处
There's certain diseconomy

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,080
好吧 哪儿?
Well, where?

327
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,320
我有时会觉得恰恰是
Well. I sometimes feel that the very way

328
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,920
我们的行事排场太过奢侈
we do things is on too lavish a scale.

329
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,760
您知道 汽车 办公器材
You know, cars, furnishings...

330
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,240
娱乐设备 私人办公人员 复印机…
entertainments, private office staff...

331
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,000
对 对 对 好极了
Yes. Yes. Yes. Fine. Yes.

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,080
我们就从这下手 这可太妙了
That's where we'll start. Magnificent.

333
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,600
不过 这里还有个问题      我就知道
Yes, unfortunely there is a difficulty. I knew it

334
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,040
是啊 如果上头的人还继续享受
It does cause profound resentment

335
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,000
各种便利和舒适
if those at the top continue to enjoy

336
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
却不让下面的人分享
the comforts, the conveniences,

337
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
势必会引起强烈的不满
they with draw from those below them,

338
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,080
更不必说公众舆论导致的可怕后果
not to mention the deeply damaging publicity...

339
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,560
你是说我和你应该…
You mean you and I should...

340
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,320
以身作则?
Set a personal example?

341
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,280
节约应从'我'做起?
Economy begins at home?

342
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,480
我们必须身体力行
We can't expect others to do

343
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,840
才能令人信服 不是吗?
what we don't do ourselves, can we?

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,600
靠这个好像省不出多少吧?
Does it really save all that much?

345
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,280
当然不会直接省下来
Well, not directly, no.

346
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:43,440
但对整个政府部门的模范作用将不可限量
but as an example to the whole public service incalculable.

347
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,600
好吧 我不知道...
Well, I don't know...

348
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,480
吉姆 会产生巨大的公众效应
Jim, there'd be a lot of great publicity in it:

349
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
"大臣指明了方向"
"The Minister shows the way".

350
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,560
"清廉的内阁"
"Slimline Government".

351
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,880
"哈克作出了表率"
"Hacker sets an example".

352
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,760
吉姆号召"节约"
"Save it" says Jim.

353
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,560
对 对 就这样
Yes. Yes, that's it.

354
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,520
好极了 我们从何开始?
Great, where do we start?

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,880
关掉...     抱歉 你睡了?
Turn the...     Sorry. Were you asleep?

356
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,840
是的
Yes.

357
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,920
我错过了火车
I missed my train.

358
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,240
不得不一路步行到尤斯顿
Had to walk all the way to Euston.

359
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,120
你的那辆公家司机开的车呢?
What happen to the chauffeur driven car?

360
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,960
削减掉了
Got rid of it.

361
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,880
为什么?
Why?

362
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,200
连司机一起退掉了
Got rid of all the chauffeur, too.

363
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,760
所有豪华的办公家具
and all that grand office furniture,

364
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,720
藏酒 我私人办公室的大半人员
drinks cabinet, half the staff in my private office.

365
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,640
你被开除了     没有 没有
You've been sacked.     No, no...

366
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,160
那是为什么?     这叫节约运动
Then why?     It's an economy drive.

367
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,680
我在作表率
I'm setting an example.

368
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,720
没有奢侈品 没有虚架子 没有特权
No luxuries, no frills, no privileges...

369
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,240
你疯了
You're mad...

370
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,320
你做了20年后座议员 一直抱怨缺东少西
For 20 years you've complained you had no facilities.

371
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,480
现在一应俱全 你又统统放弃
Now you have been given them and you are throwing them away.

372
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,600
你20年来一直想有所成就
20 years you've wanted to be a success.

373
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,800
如果还没失败来得舒适 这又是何苦呢?
Why did you want it, if it brings no greater comfort than failure?

374
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,920
亲爱的 你不懂政治 对吧?
You don't really understand politics to you.

375
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,200
长此以往 将会给我更大的权利
This way's gonna bring me much more power in the end.

376
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,720
说的不错 亲爱的 你以后当上首相
Yeah, darling. And how are you going to travel

377
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,120
打算以什么代步?

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,280

您私人办公的裁员状况
staff economies in your private office,

397
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,880
搞清所有安排十分困难
it is awfully difficult to keep track.

这我也无能为力 下午的日程是

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,080
太棒了 对吗?
Terrific, isn't it?

450
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,840
您已经给我读过了 大臣
You have read it to me already.

451
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,920
棒极了 对吗?     是的 大臣
Great, isn't it?    Yes, Minister.

452
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,880
节约正在起步(on the beach还有搁浅之意)
Economise on the beaches...

453
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,000
打扰了    什么事?
Excuse me.     Yes? Yes?

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,960
我想见大臣
I would like to see the minister.

455
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,240
您预约了吗?
Do you have an appointment?

456
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,720
我叫罗恩・沃森 我是公务员系统

457
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,760

458
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,880
好的 沃森先生
Yes, Mr. Watson.

459
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,600
听闻裁员将涉及到我们的会员
We're disturbed about rumours

460
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,760
我们倍感不安
of redundancies affecting our members...

461
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,560
抱歉 沃森先生 您不能见大臣
I'm sorry,Mr. Watson. you can't see the minister.

462
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,680
您必须事先预约
You must have an appointment.

463
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,160
这样吧 明天打电话给我
Phone me tomorrow.

464
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,800
为何不能现在安排?
Why can't I arrange it now?

465
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
很抱歉     竟然这样
I'm sorry.     Oh, really

466
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,840
好吧 曼迪 安排沃森先生

467
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
下周与大臣会面

468
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,720
下周?
Next week?

469
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
你好 布拉夫先生
Hello... Mr. Brough.

470
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
是的 我们正等着布拉夫先生
Yes, we're expecting Mr. Brough now.

471
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,320
在尤斯顿耽搁了?
When's it due in at Euston?

472
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,480
我们不得不取消今天的会面了
We'll just have to cancel it for today then.

473
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,720
好的 我会向他转达 再见
Yes, yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

474
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,480
抱歉让您久等了
Sorry to keep you.

475
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,960
您的预约 定在何时比较方便?
Now, about your appointment. When would be convenient...

476
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,320
会面取消了?    是的
The meeting's cancelled then?     Yes.

477
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,960
那我现在可以见他了吧
So I can see him now.

478
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,880
恐怕不行 您瞧...
I'm afraid not, you see...

479
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,960
您能稍等片刻吗?
Would you excuse me just a moment?

480
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,840
喂? 不 他不在
Yes? No. He's not here.

481
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,480
他去上议院的组织秘书办公室了
He's gone over to the Whips Office.

482
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,880
您需要转分机吗?
Would you like the extension?

483
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,760
您是…
Ah, Mr...

484
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,200
布拉夫先生?
Brough?

485
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,800
不是 布拉夫先生不得不取消会见
No. Mr. Brough's had to cancel the meeting.

486
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,440
我是罗恩・沃森 我来...
My name's Ron Watson. I'm...

487
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,400
很高兴您能替他来
I'm glad you could get here instead.

488
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
请坐吧 好吗     谢谢
Do sit down, won't you.     Oh, thank you.

489
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,280
好吧 恩...
Now, Mr. Er...

490
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
沃森
Watson.

491
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,000
沃森先生 在我们开始前
Mr. Watson, Before we start

492
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,280
我必须首先强调一点
there's one thing I must make absolutely clear.

493
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,320
这话一定不能传出去
This must not get out.

494
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
要是工会听闻了风声
If the unions were to get to hear of this

495
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,640
准要闹翻天了
all hell would be let loose.

496
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,040
好的
Oh, yes.

497
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,680
当然要进行裁员 不裁减...
Of course there'll be redundancies. You simply...

498
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,080
不裁减冗余的工作人员
You simply can't slim down a giant bureaucracy

499
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,880
如何精简庞大的官僚机构
like this without getting rid of people.

500
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
最终 会裁减大量人员
Ultimately, a lot of people.

501
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,360
您为何不首先与工会商量呢?
Won't you be holding discussions with the Unions first?

502
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,760
我们会做做样子 进行磋商
We'll go through the charade of discussions,

503
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
但你也知道工会分子们都是些什么人
but you know what Trade Unionists are like;

504
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,760
就会胡搅蛮缠 个个愚蠢透顶
thick as two short planks and bloody minded.

505
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,280
个个如此?
All of them?

506
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,000
几乎都是 天哪 你该有体会
Pretty well. Good lord, you should know.

507
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,400
工会之间只热衷于互挖墙脚
They're interested in poaching each other's members

508
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,400
争上电视 还管不住自己的大嘴巴
and they can't keep their big mouths shut.

509
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,720
司机和交通服务人员怎么办?
What about drivers and transport service staff?

510
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,520
当然是首当其冲
First to go. Good lord.

511
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,720
我们在轿车与司机上浪费了大量财力
We waste a fortuna on cars and drivers.

512
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,720
而他们个个好逸恶劳     懂了
And they're all on the fiddle.     Oh, I see.

513
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,800
其实 我刚才正要解释
Because, as I was trying to explain that,

514
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,160
我不是布拉夫先生的代表
I'm not Mr. Brough's deputy.

515
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,360
我是公务员系统交通工人
I'm the General Secretary of the Union of

516
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,240
以及政府后勤人员工会的总书记
Civil Service Transport and Associated Government Workers.

517
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,320
哦 我...
Ah. I...

518
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,840
我来此是为了核实
I came here to check there was no truth in

519
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,880
裁减我成员的谣传是否属实
the rumours of redundancies for my members.

520
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,840
好吧 我...
Well... I... I...

521
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,240
我刚才的意思是...
All I meant was...

522
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,320
哦 天哪
Oh, God.

523
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,960
(公务员交通部门罢工)

524
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
他逐字引用我的话
He quotes me, word for word:

525
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,600
"当然要进行裁员 大量人员"
"Of course there will be redundancies. Lots"

526
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,720
万分抱歉 大臣
I'm most terribly sorry.

527
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,320
所有司机都罢工了?
Are all the drivers on strike?

528
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,800
全部响应
100 % response.

529
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,920
伯纳 你怎么能眼看着它发生?
How could you allow this to happen?

530
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,640
C.B.E. 大臣阁下
C.B.E., Minister.

531
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,520
什么C.B.E.?
C.B. E?

532
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,040
无法面面俱到
Can't be everywhere.

533
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,880
当然 在通常情况下...
Of course, in normal circumstances...

534
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,600
好了 好了 知道了 知道了
Yes. Yes. I know, I know.

535
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
恕我提醒 您和哈克夫人8点要出席
Would you mind if I remind you. You and Mrs. Hacker are due

536
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
法国大使馆的招待会
at the French Embassy at 8.

537
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,720
对 帮我备车好吗?
Oh, yes. Get me the car, will you?

538
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,280
最好给哈克夫人打个电话
Oh... Better ring Mrs. Hacker,

539
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,080
让她开我们的车进城
ask her to bring our car into town.

540
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,200
恐怕无法如您所愿 大臣
Well I have to ignore the possibility, minister.

541
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,400
哈克夫人说将它放在修车厂修理了
Mrs. Hacker said she had dropped it off at the garage.

542
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,280
她就不能明天再修吗
She'll have to do that tomorrow.

543
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,080
至少能开到肯辛顿吧
It'll get us as far as Kensington anyway.

544
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,320
这应该不成问题
At least there are no problems about that.

545
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,720
安妮 不妙 我们必须步行
Annie, it's no good. We'll have to walk.

546
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,200
你带伞了吗?
Have you got the umbrella?

547
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
没 你没带吗?
No, haven't you?

548
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,720
这下好了
Terrific.

549
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,000
你走错方向了
You're going the wrong way.

550
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,520
没有 我回家去了
I'm not, I'm going home.

551
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,640
安妮 我知道是什么问题了
Annie I think I've found what's wrong.

552
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,000
我早就知道了
I know I have

553
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,960
(法国大使馆)

554
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,560
先生 有何贵干?
Oui, Monsieur?

555
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,280
女皇政府行政事务部大臣
Her Majesty's Minister for Administrative Affairs.

556
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,640
我的车坏了
My car broke down.

557
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,280
哈克先生 看来您需要喝点香槟
Mr. Hacker, you look as if you need some champagne.

558
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
是啊 越多越好
I do. Lots

559
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
哈克先生?
Mr. Hacker?

560
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,160
谢了 老兄
Thanks, mate.

561
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
黄色小报
Gutter press

562
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,840
好吧 他们怎么说的?
All right, what do they say?

563
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,720
"节约大师香槟酒会后醉卧排水沟"
Mr. Economy falls down in gutter after champagne party".

564
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,960
老天     这个好点
Oh, my God     This one is better.

565
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,880
"哈克在大使招待会后疲惫不堪 情绪失控"
"Hacker tired and emotional after Embassy reception".

566
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,320
这叫好点?      至少有些不同
Is that better?     It's different.

567
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,440
有没有谁说过任何
Do any of them say anything

568
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,280
"疲惫不堪 情绪失控"之外的话?
other than "tired and emotional"?

569
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,680
威廉・希基说您过度兴奋 大臣阁下
William Hickey said you were overwrought, Minister.

570
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,960
只是"过度兴奋"?
Just "overwrought"?

571
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,280
没有提到醉酒?
Nothing about being drunk?

572
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,360
只有"过度兴奋"
Just "overwrought".

573
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,960
原话其实是 "过度兴奋如同笨蛋"
"Overwrought as a newt", actually.

574
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
还能有比这更糟吗 还有吗?
It couldn't really be any worse.

575
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,120
我不想打击您 大臣
I don't want to depress you, minister...

576
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,840
但"泰晤士报"上有个头版报道
but there is just this lead story in The Times.

577
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,960
的确更糟
It is worse

578
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,000
"哈克征募了400名新公务员
"Hacker recruit 400 new Civil Servants in,

579
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,680
在其'节约运动'期间"
quote, "economy drive"

580
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,520
增加400名公务员?     大臣 您吩咐用他们
400 more Civil Servants?     You asked for them.

581
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,640
您要求彻底的研究 收集事实和数据
You demanded a complete study, facts and figures.

582
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
这些措施得有人手才行
These measures cannot be taken with non people.

583
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,200
您想出了额外的工作 就必须雇佣更多的人手
You create more jobs. More people have to be employed.

584
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,600
这是常识而已
It's common sense.

585
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,880
如果您还坚持落实政府部门监察办公室
If you persist with the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office,

586
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,160
那就至少还要再添400个新职位
there'll be another 400 new jobs there as well.

587
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,280
我们该怎么办呢?     大臣阁下
What are we going to do?     Well, Minister...

588
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
如果我们停止节约运动
If we were to end the economy drive

589
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,320
关闭政府部门监察办公室
and close the Bureaucratic Watchdog Office,

590
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,520
我们可以立即发布新闻通告
we could issue an immediate press announcement

591
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
说您砍掉了800个职位
that you'd axed 800 jobs.

592
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,880
现在请您过目一下这份草拟的提案
Now, if you'd care to glance at this draft proposal...

593
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,720
但没人担任过这些职位啊 还没任命过谁呢
But nobody's doing those jobs. Nobody has been recruited yet.

594
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,080
这样节约就更可观了
And even greater economy,

595
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,920
我们还节省了800份裁员费
