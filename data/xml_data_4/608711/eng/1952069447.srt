1
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,572
Where's Danny?

2
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:11,121
I don't know.
He disappeared just after we took off.

3
00:00:11,213 --> 00:00:12,612
Here he is.

4
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:22,888
Right, listen, it's been fun, hasn't it?

5
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:25,885
All right and I'm going to call you
just like I promised I said I would.

6
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,565
How's your head?

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:30,725
That's all right, I'll call engineering.
I'll get that soap dispenser...

8
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,281
moved down a little bit.
It's dangerous, could have your eye out.

9
00:00:33,373 --> 00:00:35,841
Okay, got to go. Big kiss.

10
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:38,771
There it is, go on.

11
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:52,123
-Finished?
-Yeah, just having a flashback.

12
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:55,523
-Ash, get us a car.
-Right.

13
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:58,364
So that's where you disappeared to?

14
00:00:58,453 --> 00:01:01,843
Well, there's something about
trolley dollies. It must be all that makeup.

15
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:04,766
-Three hours?
-Oh, no.

16
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:08,127
No, the last two, I was flying the plane.

17
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:05,366
-Nice place.
-Start as you mean to go on.

18
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,441
Mick?

19
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,447
Look I don't care
if he does know the Chancellor...

20
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:24,049
the price is still nine million,
non-negotiable. Hold. Yes?

21
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:27,843
There seems to be some confusion
over the reservation.

22
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,644
-There wasn't one.
-Janet?

23
00:03:30,813 --> 00:03:33,452
Well, I called this morning to confirm.

24
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:36,762
I'm sure it was just an oversight.

25
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:39,049
Our reservations clerk is new.

26
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:41,772
So new in fact,
she forgot to swipe your credit card.

27
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,252
And you are?

28
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,402
I'm the manager.

29
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,961
-Yes, Nigel?
-Yes.

30
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:49,442
Nigel, I will see to it right away.

31
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,171
Well, if I could just take it--

32
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,528
Excuse me. Yes, I'm still here.

33
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:56,850
Yes, and the price is still the same.
Would you hold please?

34
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:59,845
Thank you for dealing with this matter
personally, I will get right on it.

35
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,082
Right.

36
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,924
-Thank you.
-No problem.

37
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,442
Okay, let's do what we do best.

38
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,123
Let me get this straight.
What you're telling me is...

39
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,932
you're going to take my 100,000 in cash...

40
00:04:57,013 --> 00:04:59,288
do your little share scam thing...

41
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:02,805
then bring me back half a million,
in five days, is that right?

42
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:04,884
Guaranteed. But we'll have to be quick.

43
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,487
Crown Offshore find out
that we've manipulated their stock...

44
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,484
we'll be dead in the water.

45
00:05:09,573 --> 00:05:11,689
Come on, think about it, Howard.

46
00:05:11,773 --> 00:05:16,528
A guaranteed minimum return of 500%,
no risk, no fuss.

47
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:20,088
-It sounds fantastic.
-It is.

48
00:05:20,173 --> 00:05:22,812
Your competitors will be sick
when they find out...

49
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,326
how much money
you've made on the deal.

50
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,051
And you're willing to let me in?

51
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:27,964
First name on my list.

52
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:30,612
Half a mil, one hit.

53
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:33,526
-No questions asked.
-I've got a question.

54
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,762
Shoot.

55
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,290
Where on my forehead
does it say cash dispenser?

56
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,243
-I'm not with you.
-Really?

57
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:46,292
Let me spell it out for you, as you're
clearly not the sharpest tool in the box.

58
00:05:46,373 --> 00:05:48,284
You tell me
about this great deal you have.

59
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:51,445
Guy on the inside, guaranteed returns,
blah, blah, blah.

60
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:55,321
I give you a grand, you give me four back.
You with me so far?

61
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:59,448
I'll take that as a yes.
So now I'm three grand up.

62
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,171
Thank you very much, by the way.

63
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:04,131
You're three grand down, but you're
hoping that's a good investment.

64
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,842
Why? Because giving me three grand
should convince me to give you more.

65
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,730
Let's call it bait.

66
00:06:09,813 --> 00:06:13,089
You all right? You look a bit peaky.
Can I get you a drink or something?

67
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,243
No? So.

68
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,848
Now I give you a suitcase full of money,
cash of course.

69
00:06:18,933 --> 00:06:20,764
After all, I can trust you, can't I?

70
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:22,809
You've already made me money.

71
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,531
Only this time...

72
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:27,006
you disappear.

73
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:30,603
Simple. Imaginative.

74
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:33,091
What could go wrong?

75
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,652
Okay, that's it. Deal's off.

76
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:40,604
Clear you don't trust me.

77
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:42,843
I suggest we call it a day.

78
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:45,163
But my money's here.

79
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:49,246
No, I'll find someone
who appreciates what I'm offering.

80
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,882
I appreciate it, really I do.
Please. Please take my money.

81
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:56,086
Do your magic thing one more time.

82
00:07:11,293 --> 00:07:15,252
Okay, look, you're Â£3,000 to the good.

83
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:17,484
Let's just leave things as they are.

84
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,212
No, let's not.

85
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:31,612
Give this to the police.

86
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,132
Oh, no.

87
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,965
What kind of welcome's that?

88
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,806
The kind you get when you disappear
without paying your tab.

89
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:46,248
We thought you'd be pleased to see us.

90
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,723
My accountant said
I should bar you until you pay up.

91
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:52,488
-You've got an accountant?
-Yes.

92
00:07:55,413 --> 00:07:57,290
So, you're all barred.

93
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,211
Okay, Eddie, if that's the way
you feel about it.

94
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:06,645
-How about one last drink?
-For old times' sake.

95
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,891
Okay, one drink.

96
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:12,406
Cheers, Eddie, bring them over.

97
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,404
And put them on our tab.

98
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:20,205
We got a lottery winner here.

99
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,284
If you beat the odds
of fourteen million-to-one...

100
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,523
you deserve to keep your money.

101
00:08:24,613 --> 00:08:27,810
Telecommunications boss
gets golden handshake.

102
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:29,522
Sorry.

103
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:37,642
Hello?

104
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,724
Alice, Alice, Alice!

105
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,770
God, yeah. Yeah, of course I remember.

106
00:08:45,053 --> 00:08:47,248
Yeah, mine is, too, it's killing me.

107
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,530
I can't talk right now, sweetheart,
'cause I'm, you know, I'm just about to....

108
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:53,729
I'm just about to go into theater.

109
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,443
Yeah, all right, I'll definitely call you back.
Definitely.

110
00:08:57,613 --> 00:08:59,251
All right, goodbye.

111
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,207
Bye.

112
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,648
You're a very sick man, Danny.

113
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,042
Look at me, surrounded by angels.

114
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:11,169
All right, this is your last drink,
then you're all barred.

115
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:13,926
You really should work on your
customer service, Edward.

116
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:17,847
-You're almost there.
-I save that for paying customers.

117
00:09:22,893 --> 00:09:24,485
I suppose you've heard about Harry.

118
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:28,009
-Who?
-Harry Holmes, one of your lot, ain't he?

119
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,566
-Old-time grifter.
-Yeah, he's one of the best.

120
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:32,802
What happened, Harry.

121
00:09:32,893 --> 00:09:36,363
Seems he was taken
for 30,000 a few years back.

122
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,803
He remembered the sequence.

123
00:09:38,893 --> 00:09:42,488
So he took you for the convincer,
and then turned you in?

124
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:44,927
How much?

125
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:46,842
3,000.

126
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,444
This is what I don't get, right.

127
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:54,482
Why didn't he just pocket your three grand
and, you know, let you walk away?

128
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:56,723
He loved it, you know?

129
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,969
Telling me how clever he was.

130
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:03,251
Taped every conversation we had,
then made a full statement.

131
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,122
So who is he?

132
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,365
A young high flier called Howard Jennings.

133
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:12,048
He's a property broker. He finds land
for the major developers to build on.

134
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:13,925
Nasty piece of work.

135
00:10:16,013 --> 00:10:18,243
I really thought I had him.

136
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:23,282
He's obsessive, always one step ahead,
has files on all his opponents.

137
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:26,445
Checks everything out,
nothing left to chance.

138
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,888
A rival company
snatched a large parcel of land...

139
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,009
from under his nose last month.

140
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:33,561
Took a nine iron to his own desk.

141
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:39,373
It's like he needs
a course in anger management.

142
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:44,164
Made worse when they discovered a cache
of old Roman coins during excavation.

143
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:46,323
Worth a fortune, apparently.

144
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,003
Made him a laughingstock.

145
00:10:49,093 --> 00:10:51,732
Sounds like it couldn't happen
to a nicer bloke.

146
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:59,803
-Do you need anything?
-No. Thanks, Mickey, but I'm fine.

147
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:05,561
I appreciate you coming, though.
Know it couldn't have been easy.

148
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:09,928
Mick, did you have to dress like that
when you were inside?

149
00:11:10,013 --> 00:11:11,765
-Drop it, Danny.
-It was a joke.

150
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:14,686
-A bad one.
-Sorry, Mick, no offense.

151
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:15,922
None taken.

152
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:17,492
Listen, right, listen up.

153
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:20,007
I say we take this Jennings bloke.

154
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,131
-We can't.
-Why not?

155
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,249
-Tell him, Ash.
-Well, he's clued up.

156
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:27,643
When some realize they've been conned,
they get obsessed by it.

157
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,132
You know, research the subject.

158
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:33,047
And if he knows enough to take convincer
money off a good grifter like Harry...

159
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,486
that's what he's done.

160
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,450
Which means they can't be taken again.

161
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,364
First rule of the con...

162
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,171
always stay one step ahead of the mark.

163
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:41,288
Hang on a minute.

164
00:11:41,373 --> 00:11:44,251
I thought the first rule of the con
was you can't cheat an honest man.

165
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:47,086
-It's that, too.
-Yeah, can he do that, Albert?

166
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,323
Can he just change the first rule
when he wants?

167
00:11:49,413 --> 00:11:51,643
You can't con someone who knows
when they're being conned.

168
00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:53,803
You're saying,
this bloke's too clever for us?

169
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:55,804
No, I'm saying we play percentages.

170
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:59,681
And if the mark knows the plays,
it leaves us nowhere to go.

171
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,366
Excuse me.

172
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,282
No, idiot.

173
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:06,011
Hello, gorgeous girl.

174
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,448
Yes, I'm with a patient. Who?

175
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,529
One of the passengers, that's right.

176
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:16,367
Yeah, it's the turbulence in the air....
Sickness, nightmare.

177
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:19,525
All right, yeah, I'll call you, of course. Bye.

178
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,682
Look.

179
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:24,891
What's the one thing you've said to me
more than anything else?

180
00:12:25,013 --> 00:12:27,766
Apart from ''Shut up, Danny.''

181
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:31,812
Listen, now, everyone has a way in,
all right, everyone's got a weakness.

182
00:12:31,893 --> 00:12:34,123
Maybe he's the exception
that proves the rule.

183
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:35,248
Maybe he's not, okay?

184
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,325
A mark is a mark is a mark...

185
00:12:38,413 --> 00:12:39,687
is a mark.

186
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:44,085
All right, look, there's no point doing
all this Kung Fu, Grassyhopper stuff...

187
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:47,245
Mickey, with me, if you're not going
to let me put it to the test.

188
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,893
Danny, the long con is a science.

189
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,409
It's about reason, covering all the angles,
leaving nothing to chance.

190
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:54,721
Yeah.

191
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,443
But it's also about having
the bottle to go for it.

192
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,366
Look any idiot can go for it.

193
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,691
But a con artist takes the mark's money...

194
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:05,331
and he doesn't even know
he's been conned.

195
00:13:05,413 --> 00:13:09,326
Yeah, okay.
But isn't it also about gut instinct?

196
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,881
What's Albert call it?
What do you call it, Albert? Grift sense?

197
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:14,646
Most of all
it's about not taking unnecessary risks.

198
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:17,372
All right. Let's put it out.
Let's ask the others.

199
00:13:17,453 --> 00:13:19,011
Leave me out of it.

200
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:20,890
Just pretend I'm not here, all right?

201
00:13:20,973 --> 00:13:23,771
Thanks a lot. Okay. Let's let Albert decide.

202
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:26,162
Well, on the surface, granted...

203
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:28,483
trying to con Jennings is a bad idea.

204
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,928
But there's another challenge here.

205
00:13:31,013 --> 00:13:32,969
Two styles of grifting.

206
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:37,968
One reasoned, well thought out,
as Mickey says, covering all the angles.

207
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,521
The other more intuitive...

208
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,891
daring, relying on one's ability
to think on their feet.

209
00:13:44,973 --> 00:13:47,726
Which is the best? Hard to say.

210
00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:51,048
They each have merits of their own.

211
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:53,567
See? I got merits.

212
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:57,566
Of course, the true con
has elements of both.

213
00:13:57,973 --> 00:14:01,966
That's it, then, what Albert says.
It's a challenge.

214
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:03,168
What?

215
00:14:03,253 --> 00:14:07,769
We take the con. If it works,
I win, and if it don't, you do.

216
00:14:08,173 --> 00:14:13,008
-You don't think that's a little childish?
-No, Mickey. No, I don't. Okay?

217
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:15,848
50p?

218
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:22,365
-What?
-50p says that I can take him.

219
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,049
-50p.
-Yeah, cash.

220
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,131
To con the un-connable mark.

221
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:33,847
Of course, if you're too much
of a girly wuss, Mickey...

222
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:37,846
a little bit too frightened to take the bet,
we'll just leave it right there.

223
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,567
Okay, superstar.
You have got yourself a bet.

224
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,044
So we're actually going to do this?

225
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:54,043
Well, it looks like it. Yeah.

226
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,646
Tell them it's non-negotiable.

227
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,770
I want this loser sent down
for whatever the maximum sentence is.

228
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:02,323
He played the game, he lost.
He pays the bill. End of.

229
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,889
Very simple, just think.

230
00:15:19,173 --> 00:15:20,811
Think it through.

231
00:15:21,293 --> 00:15:24,490
Look, Danny. Why do you always
have to go out on a limb, hey?

232
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:30,409
I don't know. I just hear myself
saying it, Ash, and then...

233
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:33,967
that's it. Anyway, I'm in it now.

234
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,012
Need any help?

235
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,492
Me, no.

236
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:53,371
No, thanks. No, I've got it all sussed.

237
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:58,402
I'm just really, you know,
going through those fine details.

238
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:00,892
Details?

239
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:04,445
I know what you're thinking.

240
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,522
Do you?

241
00:16:05,613 --> 00:16:07,365
You're thinking
the most important thing...

242
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,603
is to keep him away from the police, right?

243
00:16:09,693 --> 00:16:10,921
Most marks don't report a con...

244
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,049
because they think
they've done something illegal...

245
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:17,331
or better still, they don't know
they've been conned in the first place.

246
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,608
Yeah, that's right.

247
00:16:20,453 --> 00:16:22,364
With Jennings,
his reputation is the biggest thing.

248
00:16:22,453 --> 00:16:24,364
He has to be seen as top dog.

249
00:16:24,453 --> 00:16:25,852
Brilliant!

250
00:16:27,093 --> 00:16:29,163
Brilliant. It is.... Wow!

251
00:16:29,253 --> 00:16:31,528
That's like you're in my head.

252
00:16:31,973 --> 00:16:34,487
You're probably thinking of a way
to make him look stupid...

253
00:16:34,573 --> 00:16:37,041
if he did go to the police, right?

254
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:38,202
Right.

255
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,450
Something that might ruin his reputation,
that sort of thing?

256
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:47,721
You know what?
That is really, really clever.

257
00:16:49,613 --> 00:16:51,888
Yeah, I scare myself sometimes.

258
00:16:56,653 --> 00:17:00,612
Okay, I've got it! Right, listen up.

259
00:17:00,693 --> 00:17:04,686
Briefing back here, one hour.
Don't be late. Thank you.

260
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,531
Let's make it two.

261
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:18,089
You see, whatever we do
has to be so outrageous...

262
00:17:18,173 --> 00:17:21,768
that even if he knows he's being conned,
he ain't going to go to the police...

263
00:17:21,853 --> 00:17:25,004
because he's going to look a prat.
Right, I got the idea from Harry.

264
00:17:25,093 --> 00:17:27,482
You remember he said
this Jennings bloke was miffed...

265
00:17:27,573 --> 00:17:29,803
'cause that other company
found all them gold coins.

266
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:32,282
-Yeah, and?
-And...

267
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:34,568
we sell him a piece of land...

268
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,008
but we make him believe
there's something under it.

269
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,367
Such as?

270
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:41,013
I read about this museum exhibition--

271
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,608
-You read something?
-Yes, thank you, Stacie. I can read.

272
00:17:44,693 --> 00:17:45,682
Thank you.

273
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,688
Actually, Irish John told me about it.

274
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:51,606
Right. The Jubilee collection.

275
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:55,083
Gold artifacts dating back
to the Bronze Age, found...

276
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:59,052
when they were extending
the Jubilee line into the East End.

277
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,327
Yeah, I heard about that.

278
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,325
What they couldn't work out was
where all the gold came from.

279
00:18:03,413 --> 00:18:05,404
It suggested
that the Bronze Age inhabitants...

280
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,484
of what would
eventually become London...

281
00:18:07,573 --> 00:18:10,451
-had a plentiful supply--
-Thank you, I was just about to say that.

282
00:18:10,533 --> 00:18:12,728
Hold on. Why couldn't the gold have come
from somewhere else?

283
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:15,611
There are more likely sites
in the Mendips or Wales, but...

284
00:18:15,693 --> 00:18:20,369
as the M4 wasn't built for the next 5,000
years, chances are it was mined locally.

285
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:23,047
-Gold mine scam--
-Hello, thank you.

286
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,408
-This is my con.
-Wait a sec.

287
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:30,006
We're going to sell this guy a gold mine?
In Central London?

288
00:18:31,493 --> 00:18:32,687
Why not?

289
00:18:34,293 --> 00:18:37,126
This is going to be the easiest 50 pence
I've ever earned.

290
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:39,886
Okay, yeah, all right.
But don't spend your money just yet...

291
00:18:39,973 --> 00:18:41,372
'cause that is the whole point.

292
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,331
The more outrageous it is, the less...

293
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:46,290
he's going to see it coming.

294
00:18:46,373 --> 00:18:49,092
Well, there's a twisted logic
in there somewhere.

295
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:51,004
No, he's got a point. You know, I mean...

296
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:53,209
who'd be stupid enough to try
and sell a fake gold mine...

297
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:55,249
in the middle of London?

298
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,287
There you go.

299
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:02,852
Harry told me Jennings reads
The Telegraph.

300
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,288
So we mock up a copy for him.

301
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:09,446
Now he must know about the collection,
but let's remind him.

302
00:19:37,933 --> 00:19:40,163
Phase two, the land itself.

303
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:49,004
Ash has found us a place.

304
00:19:49,093 --> 00:19:53,848
15,000 square feet, less than a mile
from where the artifacts were found.

305
00:19:53,933 --> 00:19:56,686
Run as an old rag and bone yard for years.
Now the old guy--

306
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:00,891
Thank you very much. The old man
is retiring, so he's willing to sell it to us.

307
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:03,487
The agreement is we pay
when we find a buyer.

308
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:07,771
Okay, I say we sell it to Howard
for twice what the land's worth.

309
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:10,606
We'll pack the old boy off
on holiday to Bognor Regis...

310
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:12,888
so he's going to be out of our hair
for two weeks.

311
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,806
How do we convince the mark
about the gold?

312
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:19,205
All we got to do is plant the seed.

313
00:20:19,293 --> 00:20:21,887
Just enough to get him
to take a soil test...

314
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,965
and then get a gold expert
in for evaluation.

315
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:28,443
And he, of course, will be one of us.

316
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,208
What do you think?

317
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,761
If it had any more holes,
you could strain tea with it.

318
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:37,447
Let's be honest, mate,
you're just frightened of losing the bet.

319
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,808
Okay. So what's first?

320
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,885
-Ash, what about the office?
-We'll be set up in a couple of days.

321
00:20:42,973 --> 00:20:46,363
Right. Then that leaves nothing more
than for me to reel him in.

322
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,768
-What?
-Problem?

323
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,764
Yes, Albert's the roper.

324
00:20:51,853 --> 00:20:53,969
That's how this works,
we all do our own jobs.

325
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,691
Albert ropes, Stacie's the banker...

326
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:58,082
Ash is our fixer,
and you and I play the inside.

327
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,485
I know that, okay, and no offense, Albert,
but we can't do this one by the book.

328
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:06,361
If Jennings knows all the moves,
we've got to invent new ones.

329
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:10,366
No roper steering him to the inside man,
no convincer.

330
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:12,762
I'm just going to dive straight in.

331
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,522
Whoosh.

332
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,322
Whoosh?

333
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:19,845
Trust me, he won't know what's hit him.

334
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:27,931
What do you think?

335
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:30,402
It's a disaster waiting to happen.

336
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:33,252
Tell me I'm wrong.

337
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,092
I can't.

338
00:21:37,253 --> 00:21:39,209
I think we should keep an eye on him.

339
00:21:39,293 --> 00:21:40,328
All right.

340
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,892
Wish me luck.

341
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,763
Wait, I'll come with you.

342
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,887
You don't make life easy
for yourself, do you, Danny?

343
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:57,125
It'll work, Albert, all right.
It will work, just trust me on it.

344
00:21:57,213 --> 00:22:00,489
-Anything is possible.
-What, you think I'm out of my depth?

345
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:04,130
Use that talent of yours
and surprise us all.

346
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:08,688
And remember,
your first meeting with a mark is crucial.

347
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,844
If you get off on the wrong foot...

348
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,685
-you're beat from the start.
-Right.

349
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:15,207
Cold read him, learn everything you can...

350
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,966
before you say a word.

351
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:19,406
Cold what?

352
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:22,208
You do know about cold reading?

353
00:22:23,453 --> 00:22:26,650
Oh, cold reading.
I know about cold reading. Yeah.

354
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:29,611
Well, how about a little refresher course?

355
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:33,083
If we've got time, I mean.... Yes, please.

356
00:22:34,493 --> 00:22:36,723
It's really very simple. Follow me.

357
00:22:47,213 --> 00:22:48,328
What do you see?

358
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:51,126
Okay, right.

359
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,010
-A bloke.
-More specific.

360
00:22:54,093 --> 00:22:57,529
You've got to convince him that you're
like-minded, like two peas in a pod...

361
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:00,889
that you could be his friend. Now to do
that, you need to know who he is.

362
00:23:00,973 --> 00:23:02,884
To become a chameleon.

363
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:03,962
Chameleon?

364
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:07,092
Okay. His name...

365
00:23:08,573 --> 00:23:09,892
is Mark.

366
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,965
All right, okay, seriously. Well he's...

367
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,009
-he's divorced?
-There you go.

368
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:16,287
Maybe he's not, though.

369
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:19,092
He's on a business trip.
Could be here on the pull.

370
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:22,042
-Not enough cologne.
-Okay.

371
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,122
What else?

372
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:28,406
Divorced. He sees his children
on the weekends, at fast food restaurants.

373
00:23:28,493 --> 00:23:31,565
He has to pay a fortune
for the maintenance and that's left him...

374
00:23:31,653 --> 00:23:33,325
tired and stressed.

375
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,369
He probably didn't cook
before he left home.

376
00:23:35,453 --> 00:23:37,409
Consequently he's lost weight recently.

377
00:23:37,493 --> 00:23:39,051
No way. I'm not having that.

378
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,727
Look at his socks. See? Children.

379
00:23:41,813 --> 00:23:44,008
And his nails. See the stress?

380
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:45,128
His skin.

381
00:23:45,773 --> 00:23:47,445
That's the fast food, yeah?

382
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:50,843
Okay, I'm having all of this,
but how you telling me he's lost weight?

383
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,764
Look at his belt.

384
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:56,212
See the line. He's pulled it in a notch.

385
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:01,643
Mark, how are you?

386
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:05,442
Have you lost weight recently?
How are your lovely children?

387
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:16,002
Thanks.

388
00:24:31,853 --> 00:24:33,650
She's still got the hots for you.

389
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:36,172
Is that so?

390
00:24:36,253 --> 00:24:37,811
What, like you didn't know?

391
00:24:40,893 --> 00:24:43,930
This is the best crew I've ever had,
and I intend to keep it that way.

392
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:46,527
And you think hooking up with Stacie
would spoil that?

393
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:49,207
I know hooking up with Stacie
would spoil that.

394
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,610
Maybe you'd better tell her.

395
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:27,444
Guys, it's all about staying
one step ahead of the competition.

396
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:31,285
-You see what you want and you just--
-Go for it.

397
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,443
It's not ''go for it,'' Nick. It's ''get it.''

398
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,410
Yes, I mean, that's what I meant.

399
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,529
That site I had in Islington.

400
00:25:37,613 --> 00:25:39,843
83-year-old tenant blocking the deal.

401
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:42,652
She wouldn't move
because she was worried her little cat...

402
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:43,927
wouldn't find its way home.

403
00:25:44,013 --> 00:25:45,765
That's wrinklies for you.

404
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:49,050
So I ran over the cat,
she signed within a fortnight.

405
00:25:49,293 --> 00:25:51,932
See what you want, grab it by the balls.

406
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,007
Off you go.

407
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,763
Glass of shampoo, squire.

408
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:53,325
Oh, God, scenery's nice, isn't it?

409
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:55,172
Anyone tried to pull yet?

410
00:26:55,253 --> 00:26:58,211
Nick was just about to try his luck,
but he bottled it.

411
00:26:58,293 --> 00:27:00,488
I told you,
she's probably waiting for someone.

412
00:27:00,573 --> 00:27:03,565
Well, there is only one way to find out.

413
00:27:03,653 --> 00:27:06,406
50 quid says that I pull it.

414
00:27:07,653 --> 00:27:09,564
Okay, you're on.

415
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:10,642
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

416
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,803
All right. Wish me luck.

417
00:27:24,573 --> 00:27:26,165
Not a chance.

418
00:27:26,413 --> 00:27:27,607
Hi.

419
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:31,090
I'm a bit nervous, listen,
don't worry I'm not trying to pull you.

420
00:27:31,173 --> 00:27:33,926
My boyfriend would kill me.
That's a joke. All right.

421
00:27:34,013 --> 00:27:38,245
Seriously, it's my mom's birthday,
and I love her, I adore her.

422
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,530
I suppose what I'm really looking for
is a bit of womanly advice.

423
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:44,002
Now, don't cry.

424
00:27:44,093 --> 00:27:47,290
I had a girlfriend and I loved her
but she dumped me on holiday.

425
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:49,364
That's all right, thank you.

426
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:51,330
He seems to be doing all right to me.

427
00:27:56,253 --> 00:27:57,368
Could've been you.

428
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:40,287
-Fifty, weren't it?
-Pay the man, Nicholas.

429
00:28:40,373 --> 00:28:42,170
You know what I always say, Nichol-ass?

430
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:45,245
You see what you want,
you grab it by the balls.

431
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:47,530
Tell you what,
why don't I buy you all a drink?

432
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:49,968
No thanks.

433
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,486
We have to be getting back.

434
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:54,885
-Howard?
-I think I'll stay for one more.

435
00:28:54,973 --> 00:28:57,533
-See you back at the office, then.
-Yeah, see you.

436
00:28:58,813 --> 00:29:01,088
I hate a bad loser, don't you?

437
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,926
Absolutely. Howard Jennings.

438
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:06,524
Paul Carrington.

439
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,282
He loved it, you know?

440
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,762
Telling me how clever he was.

441
00:29:12,853 --> 00:29:17,005
Taped every conversation we had,
then made a full statement.

442
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:28,124
I really thought I had him.

443
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:49,288
Let's just leave things as they are.

444
00:29:49,973 --> 00:29:51,725
No. Let's not.

445
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,444
So, what do you do?

446
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:06,012
Property.

447
00:30:06,093 --> 00:30:07,890
-Property?
-Development, mostly.

448
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:11,204
I find the land, you know,
the boss flogs it to the highest bidder.

449
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:15,127
-What's the name of the company?
-Cityrise. You heard of it?

450
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,885
-No.
-Based in Manchester.

451
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,406
Just opened a London office.

452
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:21,530
-And how's business?
-It's okay.

453
00:30:21,893 --> 00:30:23,485
So who do you work for, then?

454
00:30:24,093 --> 00:30:25,412
I work for me.

455
00:30:26,293 --> 00:30:27,806
Now that is my dream.

456
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:30,327
Tell old Golden Balls
where to stick his job.

457
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:31,402
Golden Balls?

458
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:35,008
You'll know him soon enough. Going
to blow away the competition, he says.

459
00:30:35,093 --> 00:30:36,162
Really?

460
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:38,130
Biggest in London in three years,
he reckons.

461
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:40,169
Anyway, it is time I was off.

462
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:41,447
Listen, Howard.

463
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:43,445
Can we do this again?

464
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:45,012
Yeah, maybe.

465
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,771
Give my secretary a call.

466
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:51,812
Shame.

467
00:30:54,573 --> 00:30:56,052
How you fixed for tomorrow?

468
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:59,364
Really, I'm very busy.
Nice to meet you though, Paul.

469
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,002
I tell you what.
Why don't you swing over now?

470
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:07,689
Check out the new offices? You can say
hello to Golden Balls while you're there.

471
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,409
-Yeah, all right.
-Great.

472
00:31:15,493 --> 00:31:18,405
I'll just ring my secretary,
tell her I'm on my way.

473
00:31:22,453 --> 00:31:24,648
-Dorothy.
-Dorothy?

474
00:31:25,933 --> 00:31:26,922
No.

475
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:29,607
-We're not set up. We said tomorrow.
-I was losing him....

476
00:31:29,693 --> 00:31:33,003
-We have to go now.
-Danny! There's not enough time.

477
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:35,084
Dorothy. Can you hear me?

478
00:31:35,173 --> 00:31:37,084
-The line's very....
-Danny.

479
00:31:37,173 --> 00:31:38,447
Okay, let's go.

480
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,005
Excuse me. Can I help you?

481
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:44,922
Don't tempt me, darling.

482
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:47,163
We've come to give
the second floor a once over.

483
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,050
I thought you weren't starting
till tomorrow.

484
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,805
Tomorrow? Look.

485
00:31:51,253 --> 00:31:53,892
You ever done any painting
and decorating, sweetheart?

486
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:56,806
-A bit.
-Right, you ever heard of prepping?

487
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:59,131
-Well, I....
-God bless.

488
00:31:59,213 --> 00:32:02,285
I tell you what,
you can come upstairs with us...

489
00:32:02,373 --> 00:32:05,285
and give us both a hand, if you like.

490
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:10,332
-I bet you'd look great in a pair of overalls.
-I'm sure you'll manage.

491
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:59,491
He's with me. Hold all my calls. Thank you.

492
00:33:16,253 --> 00:33:20,246
Right, this is the boss's floor,
more or less...

493
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,572
and here's his office.

494
00:33:31,613 --> 00:33:34,366
-You're late.
-Yeah, sorry, business lunch.

495
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:37,763
-I brought someone back with me.
-Yeah, who?

496
00:33:37,853 --> 00:33:40,572
This is my boss Martin Stuart.
Martin this is....

497
00:33:40,653 --> 00:33:41,642
Howard Jennings.

498
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,365
So, you're Jennings?

499
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:48,051
You've heard of me, then?

500
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:51,443
James Harrison is due here in 10 minutes,
we'll need his portfolio.

501
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:55,128
Well, I'll go and dig it out then, shall I?

502
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:04,607
You're about all I have heard
since I've been down here.

503
00:34:04,693 --> 00:34:06,524
That's because this is my city.

504
00:34:06,613 --> 00:34:10,208
There's not a patch of undeveloped land
in London that I don't know about...

505
00:34:10,293 --> 00:34:11,408
and have first refusal on.

506
00:34:11,493 --> 00:34:14,371
If that's true, I guess I'll be
out of a job soon.

507
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:16,008
You said it.

508
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,844
Is that what you've come to tell me?

509
00:34:19,093 --> 00:34:20,651
Pretty much.

510
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:23,644
Actually, I doubt we're in competition.

511
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,689
You buy and sell land, so do I.

512
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,128
Yes, but mine's more specialized.

513
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,692
Specialized?

514
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:35,968
So if you'll excuse me, I do have
some work to be getting on with.

515
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,689
I'll get Paul to show you out.

516
00:35:07,893 --> 00:35:10,851
...Harrison's file on my desk now.

517
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:17,571
Show Jennings out.

518
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:19,962
Howard.

519
00:35:20,653 --> 00:35:24,282
-Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.
-Yeah, next time make an appointment.

520
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,529
You should be ashamed of yourself.

521
00:35:42,813 --> 00:35:44,326
How did it go?

522
00:35:44,413 --> 00:35:45,926
It was a piece of cake.

523
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:48,049
-We weren't even set up.
-What?

524
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,489
-He brought the mark back with him.
-I had a chance and I grabbed it.

525
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:53,165
What if we couldn't have got
set up in time?

526
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:55,209
Mickey, I had faith in you, didn't I?

527
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,887
-Where're your socks?
-Here's one of them.

528
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,691
Sorry, Danny, but it does seem
a bit messy.

529
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:00,762
Messy?

530
00:36:00,973 --> 00:36:03,441
Usually we have it all worked out.
You know, a proper plan.

531
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:08,323
Listen, gang. Listen up. We have got
a plan. Okay, we've got a plan.

532
00:36:08,413 --> 00:36:09,583
All up here.

533
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,603
You've no idea
how frightening that is, have you?

534
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,208
You just got to trust me, haven't you?

535
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:15,124
What next, then?

536
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:16,646
Well, I'm working on that one.

537
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,803
What's the first thing the mark would do?

538
00:36:18,893 --> 00:36:20,167
Well, he'd....

539
00:36:21,773 --> 00:36:23,968
What would you do?

540
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:25,486
Right. Don't tell me.

541
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:27,962
You can almost hear the cogs turning.

542
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:32,852
Research Cityrise.
Ash, please set up a web site.

543
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:35,686
I was just about to say that.

544
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:38,446
Ash, go and search the thing.

545
00:36:38,533 --> 00:36:40,091
I was just about to say that, Mickey.

546
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:42,892
All right, troops,
everyone listen up. Tomorrow.

547
00:36:42,973 --> 00:36:44,486
Ash, get the yard ready.

548
00:36:44,573 --> 00:36:47,883
Stacie, I want you down the museum.
Albert, you're our gold expert.

549
00:36:47,973 --> 00:36:51,409
-Mickey, get yourself off to the bank.
-What for?

550
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:52,846
Get your 50p out.

551
00:36:55,653 --> 00:36:58,121
Do you ever have the feeling
we've created a monster?

552
00:36:58,213 --> 00:37:00,602
All the time.

553
00:37:20,453 --> 00:37:22,728
Right. How far away?

554
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:03,529
Remarkable examples, aren't they?

555
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:10,169
Do you work here?

556
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,767
I'm in charge of the Bronze Age.

557
00:38:12,933 --> 00:38:16,209
Well, not the Bronze Age as such,
I mean, that's a period of time.

558
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:19,126
That would make me a queen,
and a time traveler, at that.

559
00:38:21,493 --> 00:38:25,406
No, I'm actually in charge of the artifacts
that hail from the period.

560
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:29,213
And these are my crowning glory.

561
00:38:30,293 --> 00:38:33,091
One of the great mysteries of London.

562
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:37,651
It seems a bit far-fetched, that there's
a gold mine in London somewhere.

563
00:38:37,853 --> 00:38:40,811
No, not really.

564
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:44,363
The landscape was very different
6,000 years ago, after all.

565
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:46,683
No, it's perfectly feasible.

566
00:38:47,373 --> 00:38:50,524
In actual fact, we have a professor
of geology here in the museum...

567
00:38:50,613 --> 00:38:52,126
who's writing a paper on it.

568
00:38:52,453 --> 00:38:55,286
Really? Where do I find this professor?

569
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:59,603
I'm a philanthropist,
I invest in scientific studies.

570
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:03,249
In that case,
I'm sure he'd be happy to talk to you.

571
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,005
Let me write down his number.

572
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:11,490
It says here the original mine
would be worth millions.

573
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:14,046
Indeed.

574
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:18,365
I doubt what you see here represents even
1% of what was actually there.

575
00:39:18,453 --> 00:39:21,809
Of course, the site has almost certainly
been built on by now, so...

576
00:39:22,373 --> 00:39:24,807
we'll never know, will we?

577
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:29,005
I've written my number on the other side.

578
00:39:32,253 --> 00:39:34,403
Enjoy the rest of your visit.

579
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:38,444
The Saxon village reconstruction
is excellent.

580
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:52,933
You don't think Danny's
going to pull this off, do you?

581
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,242
No.

582
00:39:54,653 --> 00:39:57,087
But you're letting him try anyway?

583
00:39:57,253 --> 00:40:00,928
He thinks what we do is easy. Won't hurt
to bring him down a peg or two.

584
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,171
And win the bet in the process?

585
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,688
To the victor the spoils.

586
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:14,768
Hello?

587
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:19,043
According to my notes, Howard....
May I call you Howard?

588
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,122
Yes.

589
00:40:20,813 --> 00:40:23,691
It's widely believed
that most gold deposits, particularly...

590
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:26,765
of the volcanic and sedimentary variety...

591
00:40:26,853 --> 00:40:29,413
were formed
from circulating ground waters...

592
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:31,370
driven up by magma.

593
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:36,004
But, of course, it could also be expelled
from the magma itself as it cooled.

594
00:40:36,093 --> 00:40:38,243
-And this could happen in London, right?
-Oh, yes.

595
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:42,326
No reason not,
although geologically speaking...

596
00:40:42,413 --> 00:40:45,211
-conditions aren't ideal.
-But is it possible?

597
00:40:45,613 --> 00:40:47,808
Oh, yes, there are certain residues...

598
00:40:47,893 --> 00:40:51,283
that have been around
for thousands of years.

599
00:40:52,053 --> 00:40:55,489
And how could you find out if you thought
you had land with gold in it?

600
00:40:55,573 --> 00:40:59,361
A multitude of ways,
mostly by a simple soil test.

601
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:00,442
Soil test?

602
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:02,406
So I could bring you some soil...

603
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:05,053
and you could tell from that
whether there was gold underground?

604
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:07,044
No, I have to have further tests for that.

605
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:10,967
But I could determine
that the possibility was there.

606
00:41:11,053 --> 00:41:12,281
How accurately?

607
00:41:12,373 --> 00:41:16,127
It depends on the size of the deposit.

608
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:19,808
80, 90%, possibly.

609
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:22,609
You hold such a piece of land?

610
00:41:23,693 --> 00:41:24,682
No, not yet.

611
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:28,052
But if I did, would you be prepared
to do this test for me?

612
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:31,330
Yes, of course.
If the Museum has no objection...

613
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:33,449
I'd be happy to help.

614
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:39,041
What you talking about?
I don't need all this. I don't need all this.

615
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,448
Yes.

616
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,763
Just do it, all right, do it.

617
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:52,762
Cute, isn't it? All right, mate,
how you doing? What's up?

618
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:58,806
Basically, Nick doesn't know it yet,
but he's leaving us.

619
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:02,329
So his job's up for grabs.
I just thought you might be interested.

620
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:06,449
50K a year, double that
with your commission...

621
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:09,206
nice car, relocation allowance.

622
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,330
Lovely. Yeah, I am listening.

623
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:17,685
Only trouble is I'm just not sure
you're right for it.

624
00:42:18,773 --> 00:42:21,731
I'm not sure I want to work for you.

625
00:42:21,813 --> 00:42:23,041
Don't take offense, Paul.

626
00:42:24,493 --> 00:42:27,610
It's more about what kind of deals
you're used to handling.

627
00:42:27,693 --> 00:42:31,003
I mean, with Martin,
what's the biggest deal you're doing?

628
00:42:31,093 --> 00:42:32,890
Do I look like a Muppet?

629
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:35,646
-Pardon?
-You're just trying to nick all our clients.

630
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:38,692
All right, well.

631
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,810
You can't blame a chap for trying,
can you?

632
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:46,569
Okay, look, just talk me
through one of your deals.

633
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,006
I mean....

634
00:42:49,413 --> 00:42:52,723
Martin was talking about
one the other day. What was it?

635
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:55,327
The Jubilee deal?

636
00:42:57,613 --> 00:43:01,288
-You know about that?
-A little. So what is it?

637
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:03,930
All I know...

638
00:43:04,013 --> 00:43:08,370
all I know, is that we've been hired
to buy a parcel of land...

639
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:11,570
regardless of price.

640
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:14,971
-By who?
-That I don't know.

641
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:17,089
Martin's very secretive about it.

642
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:20,563
Which usually means
that he wants to take all the credit.

643
00:43:20,653 --> 00:43:21,927
Do you know where the land is?

644
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:43,570
It's owned
by an old rag and bone merchant.

645
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:47,362
We've offered him twice what it's worth
in cash, but he ain't having any of it.

646
00:43:48,653 --> 00:43:49,768
Cash?

647
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:53,402
Yes, he hates banks.

648
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:55,082
It's a shithole.

649
00:43:55,173 --> 00:43:57,129
That's what I don't get. I mean, look at it.

650
00:43:57,213 --> 00:43:59,249
Barely going to get two houses in there,
are you?

651
00:43:59,333 --> 00:44:02,291
I mean, it ain't that far
from the Jubilee line, granted.

652
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:06,366
But, I don't know, the boss seems
very keen to pay way over the odds for it.

653
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,443
Right, can you get me in to see the owner?

654
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:11,326
What's in it for me?

655
00:44:11,413 --> 00:44:13,449
The job we discussed earlier.

656
00:44:13,853 --> 00:44:14,842
No.

657
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:18,162
Look.

658
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:21,413
I don't know what you're up to, all right.

659
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:23,245
I don't know, I don't care.

660
00:44:23,773 --> 00:44:27,448
But, you cut me in and then maybe,
you know...

661
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,728
maybe I'll suddenly start thinking about it.

662
00:44:31,733 --> 00:44:34,042
I like you, Paul, you remind me of me.

663
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:35,888
So?

664
00:44:36,893 --> 00:44:39,487
Yeah, you've got yourself a deal.
Set up a meeting.

665
00:44:44,693 --> 00:44:48,288
...all I know, is that we've been hired
to buy a parcel of land...

666
00:44:49,293 --> 00:44:51,648
regardless of price.

667
00:44:53,173 --> 00:44:55,926
...regardless of price.

668
00:44:58,213 --> 00:45:00,807
-Got to you the other day, didn't it?
-What?

669
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,408
-Going to see Harry in prison.
-Yeah, a little.

670
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:07,803
In which case, you've got a problem.

671
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,801
You know this is going
to go pear shaped, don't you?

672
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:13,804
The kid's gone off 100 miles an hour.

673
00:45:13,893 --> 00:45:16,327
Little or no groundwork,
no convincer, no Plan B.

674
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,802
Come on, give him credit,
he's played it well so far.

675
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:20,929
Come on, Mick. You know as well as I do.

676
00:45:21,013 --> 00:45:23,129
There's a huge gulf
between setting up a long con...

677
00:45:23,213 --> 00:45:24,771
and actually walking away clean.

678
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:26,842
I know.

679
00:45:27,693 --> 00:45:30,844
Which means
you've got a decision to make.

680
00:45:32,053 --> 00:45:33,486
Which is?

681
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,047
If it's going down the pan,
do you bail him out?

682
00:45:38,373 --> 00:45:41,285
Or do you let him fail, to teach him
a lesson and win the bet?

683
00:45:43,173 --> 00:45:45,243
Even if that means
you going back to prison.

684
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,121
Hello.

685
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:37,328
Howard.

686
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:41,522
Yeah, the land's worth 210.

687
00:46:41,973 --> 00:46:45,363
I think Martin's latest offer was 420.

688
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:50,650
Yeah. 450 should do it.

689
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:54,327
Okay. What time?

690
00:46:54,933 --> 00:46:56,651
Yeah, that's fine, I'll be there.

691
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,132
All right, bye.

692
00:47:01,493 --> 00:47:02,767
We're on.

693
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:10,201
Hello?

694
00:47:10,533 --> 00:47:13,286
Mr. Jennings. Yes, hi.

695
00:47:13,653 --> 00:47:16,326
At 10:30. And the address?

696
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:19,803
Right. I'll be there. Bye.

697
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:28,569
Hello? Howard? Okay, sure.

698
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,091
No problem.

699
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:34,006
And the address? Fine.

700
00:47:37,213 --> 00:47:38,487
That's weird.

701
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,530
Why does he want everyone there?

702
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:43,611
Well, I told you, didn't I?
He's a control freak.

703
00:47:43,733 --> 00:47:45,849
Okay. No problem.

704
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:47,764
Ash. Go get set up.

705
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,483
Better get your 50p ready.

706
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:10,127
-Right, you set?
-Yeah.

707
00:48:10,213 --> 00:48:11,931
Okay, 10 minutes.

708
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:29,812
This doesn't feel good.

709
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,652
It's Danny's call.

710
00:48:47,413 --> 00:48:49,369
Howard.

711
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:51,128
How are you?

712
00:48:51,653 --> 00:48:54,725
Thought I'd better bring some security.
There's a lot of money in here.

713
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:56,804
All right, lads, welcome.

714
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,929
Here he is, Colin.

715
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:02,323
This is the man I was telling you about.
Mr. Jennings.

716
00:49:02,413 --> 00:49:03,641
This is Colin Nash.

717
00:49:03,733 --> 00:49:05,132
I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Nash.

718
00:49:05,213 --> 00:49:07,647
You look like a man who's prepared
to drive a hard bargain.

719
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:08,722
Yeah, rats.

720
00:49:08,813 --> 00:49:10,929
-Really?
-I ain't got long.

721
00:49:11,013 --> 00:49:12,492
A man after my own heart.

722
00:49:12,573 --> 00:49:15,246
He tells me you're willing to beat
the other bloke's offer.

723
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,164
Indeed, yes, there's a contract here.

724
00:49:17,253 --> 00:49:19,767
And the money's in here. In cash.

725
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,405
I understand you don't like banks.

726
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,051
No, leeches.

727
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:25,407
I couldn't agree more.

728
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:27,485
So how much you got in there, then?

729
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:29,529
Â£450,000.

730
00:49:36,293 --> 00:49:37,521
It's time.

731
00:49:38,053 --> 00:49:39,042
Be careful.

732
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:50,891
So, do we have a deal?

733
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:53,009
Absolutely. Just one condition.

734
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:57,291
That I carry out a soil test.

735
00:49:57,773 --> 00:49:59,604
Soil test?

736
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:01,172
It's company policy.

737
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:05,291
Thank you for coming.

738
00:50:05,373 --> 00:50:08,092
-I'm not exactly sure why I'm here.
-Who are they?

739
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:09,652
They'll be carrying out the tests.

740
00:50:09,733 --> 00:50:12,293
No one said nothing about no soil test.

741
00:50:12,373 --> 00:50:14,568
No soil test, no deal.

742
00:50:14,653 --> 00:50:16,928
Yeah, well hurry up, then, like I said...

743
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,332
I ain't got all day.

744
00:50:18,413 --> 00:50:21,291
I've got everything I need here,
it wouldn't take long.

745
00:50:21,373 --> 00:50:22,647
In your own time.

746
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:27,848
I don't get it.

747
00:50:27,933 --> 00:50:29,685
What exactly are you looking for?

748
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:31,688
You'll see.

749
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:50,730
Well? Are you sure?

750
00:50:50,813 --> 00:50:52,405
Definite traces of gold.

751
00:50:52,493 --> 00:50:55,803
It's my belief there was an underground
stream here at some point...

752
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:59,932
skirting the main source and bringing
the particles up to the surface. See?

753
00:51:00,773 --> 00:51:02,206
Excellent.

754
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:06,765
-So do we have a deal?
-It would seem so.

755
00:51:06,853 --> 00:51:09,128
Just one more bridge to cross
and then we can sign.

756
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,771
What bridge?

757
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:11,842
Okay.

758
00:51:18,933 --> 00:51:21,288
Howard, if you're messing me about,
I'll go.

759
00:51:21,373 --> 00:51:23,045
The thing is, Paul...

760
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:26,125
it occurred to me this might all be
part of some elaborate con.

761
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:29,205
-Con?
-Surely you've heard of a confidence trick.

762
00:51:29,533 --> 00:51:31,922
For example, say you were
all part of the same gang?

763
00:51:32,013 --> 00:51:33,048
How would I know?

764
00:51:33,133 --> 00:51:35,203
I haven't met any of you until this week.

765
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,523
So for me to part
with a briefcase full of cash...

766
00:51:37,613 --> 00:51:39,763
to people I've known
for less than a week...

767
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:42,128
would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it?

768
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:44,962
And I'm not. Stupid, that is.

769
00:51:45,573 --> 00:51:47,609
So I thought I'd better get some insurance.

770
00:51:47,693 --> 00:51:50,651
You see, the Professor has just told me
there are gold deposits here.

771
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,722
Gold?

772
00:51:51,813 --> 00:51:54,202
That's right, yes, your boss was
very secretive, wasn't he?

773
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:57,524
Although you knew where the land was
and how much he'd offered.

774
00:51:58,813 --> 00:52:00,451
So now I do my own tests.

775
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:02,410
And if they don't find anything...

776
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:05,527
five minutes after you've assured me
there was gold...

777
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:08,647
then I'd have to assume
you were about to con me.

778
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:12,409
No one leave.

779
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:33,328
When they don't find gold, I've got
a feeling he's going to be very pissed off.

780
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:35,210
So if you tell me which way
you're going to run...

781
00:52:35,293 --> 00:52:37,045
I can make sure
we don't bump into each other.

782
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,646
Shit.

783
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:43,087
-I really hope Danny's got a Plan B.
-And C.

784
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:50,481
What's all this, then?

785
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:51,722
Won't take long.

786
00:53:11,373 --> 00:53:13,329
-Vermin.
-Are you quite finished?

787
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:14,641
Have to burn them.

788
00:53:16,453 --> 00:53:19,092
Hey, what the bloody hell's all this?

789
00:53:19,853 --> 00:53:22,492
Do you know I thought
you might make an appearance.

790
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:24,642
Paul?

791
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,681
This is my deal.

792
00:53:26,773 --> 00:53:29,890
-You have no idea what you're doing.
-Look.

793
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:34,330
Mr. Jennings has topped your offer,
it's been accepted.

794
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:35,402
Get over it.

795
00:53:35,493 --> 00:53:36,528
You're fired.

796
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,649
You just happened to be passing, I take it?

797
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:41,293
No. I wasn't just passing.
Dorothy told me he was here.

798
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:42,362
We've done the deal.

799
00:53:42,453 --> 00:53:43,806
I'm here to make another offer.

800
00:53:43,893 --> 00:53:48,125
Mr. Nash, now, I have another offer
that I really think you should consider.

801
00:53:48,293 --> 00:53:49,282
Boss.

802
00:53:54,053 --> 00:53:55,088
Okay.

803
00:53:55,173 --> 00:53:56,162
We're screwed.

804
00:53:56,253 --> 00:53:58,084
I take it he got Albert to do a test first.

805
00:53:58,173 --> 00:53:59,288
How did you know that?

806
00:53:59,373 --> 00:54:02,365
That's the only way
he'll know for certain if it's a con.

807
00:54:02,453 --> 00:54:04,091
So what are we going to do?

808
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:15,607
Looks like you've got yourself
a deal, Mr. Nash.

809
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:28,611
If you could sign there.

810
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,610
Thank you very much, Mr. Nash.

811
00:54:42,093 --> 00:54:44,607
Looks like you've been pipped
at the post, Golden Balls.

812
00:54:44,693 --> 00:54:47,890
Sorry about all that other stuff,
but you never know who to trust.

813
00:54:47,973 --> 00:54:50,885
Paul, about the job.
I've decided to keep Nick on after all.

814
00:54:50,973 --> 00:54:51,962
Sorry.

815
00:54:57,333 --> 00:55:01,326
Can someone explain to me
what just happened?

816
00:55:01,813 --> 00:55:03,644
-He found gold.
-How?

817
00:55:03,973 --> 00:55:06,646
Well I guess the Jubilee site
had to be somewhere.

818
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:09,122
But that means this place
could be worth millions...

819
00:55:09,213 --> 00:55:11,522
and we just flogged it to him
for a poxy 450K.

820
00:55:11,613 --> 00:55:13,285
You win some, you lose some.

821
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:16,491
That was intense.

822
00:55:16,573 --> 00:55:17,926
Let's get out of here.

823
00:55:23,573 --> 00:55:25,052
I just still don't get it.

824
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:33,169
It would have been a terrible,
terrible thing. But....

825
00:55:33,253 --> 00:55:34,322
Strangely....

826
00:55:34,413 --> 00:55:37,007
My sex life would have been
a terrible thing.

827
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:40,486
Do you know I could get used to this.

828
00:55:40,573 --> 00:55:42,689
A quiet Danny.

829
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:44,646
Silence is golden.

830
00:55:49,693 --> 00:55:51,251
Having a good laugh, are you?

831
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:53,369
Everybody having a good laugh?

832
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:56,763
Okay, where's my 50p? And I want a letter.

833
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,413
-A letter?
-Yes, I want a letter signed by you...

834
00:55:59,493 --> 00:56:04,123
apologizing for underestimating me
and stating uncategorically...

835
00:56:04,213 --> 00:56:06,568
that I'm the better grifter.
You lot can witness it.

836
00:56:06,653 --> 00:56:09,292
Eddie, paper on the bar, squire. Thank you.

837
00:56:09,373 --> 00:56:11,933
I'd happily do that, Danny.
If you'd won the bet.

838
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:14,652
-Did we sell the land or not?
-Yes.

839
00:56:14,733 --> 00:56:16,689
-Yeah, is the money in the case or not?
-Yes.

840
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:17,762
Yeah, then pay up.

841
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:19,969
No, but the bet was
which is the best style...

842
00:56:20,053 --> 00:56:23,125
your unstructured, undisciplined,
fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants...

843
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,569
let's-all-go-to-jail madness
masquerading as a long con...

844
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:31,124
or my professional, reasoned, covering-
all-the-angles, never-get-caught style.

845
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:33,202
Bollocks.

846
00:56:33,733 --> 00:56:37,009
-And that's your argument, is it?
-No, my argument is the con worked...

847
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,482
-and you should pay up.
-But the con was falling apart.

848
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:41,450
We still got paid.

849
00:56:41,533 --> 00:56:43,728
But only because I was
watching your back.

850
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:45,610
-What?
-Tell him Ash.

851
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:47,604
No, you leave me out of this.

852
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:50,651
You hadn't covered all the angles,
so I had to do it for you.

853
00:56:50,733 --> 00:56:52,928
How did you do that?
I didn't hear you say a word.

854
00:56:53,013 --> 00:56:54,241
I didn't have to.

855
00:56:54,333 --> 00:56:56,608
-You remember Ash firing his gun?
-Yeah.

856
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:58,445
He didn't actually shoot anything.

857
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:02,162
-All right, so the rat died of a heart attack.
-Actually...

858
00:57:02,253 --> 00:57:03,925
it was one I prepared earlier.

859
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:07,562
-What do you mean?
-He simply fired into the ground.

860
00:57:08,213 --> 00:57:09,248
Why?

861
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:11,210
Because he'd filled
the cartridges with gold.

862
00:57:11,293 --> 00:57:15,002
All he had to do was aim at the spot
where the sample was about to be taken...

863
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:18,483
and fire, peppering the soil with gold.

864
00:57:20,893 --> 00:57:22,963
-So there weren't any gold?
-No.

865
00:57:23,053 --> 00:57:24,327
Only what we put there.

866
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:28,122
Sorry, only what I put there
to cover your ass.

867
00:57:29,013 --> 00:57:31,652
Experience, science, Danny.

868
00:57:31,733 --> 00:57:32,927
Covering all the angles.

869
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:35,686
Not going off half-cocked.

870
00:57:35,853 --> 00:57:37,252
So I win the bet.

871
00:57:38,093 --> 00:57:40,846
Yeah, well....

872
00:57:42,453 --> 00:57:43,442
Whatever.

873
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:46,244
Call it a draw, all right?

874
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:47,925
No, now wait a minute...

875
00:57:48,013 --> 00:57:50,971
if I hadn't bailed you out, the whole thing
would have gone pear shaped.

876
00:57:51,053 --> 00:57:53,726
If it weren't for me, we wouldn't
have been there in the first place.

877
00:57:53,813 --> 00:57:56,122
-You owe me 50p. Pay up.
-No, no you pay up.

878
00:57:56,213 --> 00:57:58,408
-But I won.
-No, you didn't win.

879
00:57:58,493 --> 00:58:00,643
You didn't win. We made a case
full of money because of me.

880
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:01,882
No, because of me, you mean.

881
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:04,248
-What about the web site?
-I was going to do that.

882
00:58:04,333 --> 00:58:07,131
I arranged for Albert to give you
a lesson in cold reading.

883
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:09,249
What, cold reading?
I knew that stuff already.

884
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:10,732
No, you did not.

885
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:12,565
Looks like it's going to be a long night.

886
00:58:12,653 --> 00:58:14,530
Yes, shall we leave them to it?

887
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:17,527
Why don't you just admit it,
I beat you fair and square?

888
00:58:17,613 --> 00:58:19,205
Why don't you just admit it, all right?

889
00:58:19,293 --> 00:58:21,932
You were going to walk away,
I made us a case full of money.

890
00:58:22,013 --> 00:58:24,208
-I do hate sore losers.
-Do you?

891
00:58:25,813 --> 00:58:27,166
Double or quits.

892
00:58:27,373 --> 00:58:29,170
-What?
-I've got this great idea.

893
00:58:29,253 --> 00:58:32,290
-Oh, no.
-No, bear with me. Pigeons.

894
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:34,851
-Pigeons?
-Pigeons, yeah.

895
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:37,652
Pigeons. I read all about them.
They're worth a fortune.

896
00:58:38,133 --> 00:58:39,486
Can you paint a pigeon?

897
00:58:39,573 --> 00:58:41,723
-I'm not even listening.
-No. 'Cause you know I'm right.

898
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:42,848
Shut up, Danny.

899
00:59:22,373 --> 00:59:23,362
English
