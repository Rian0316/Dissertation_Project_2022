1
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:20,969
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,806
marriage, according to the law
of this country...

3
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,885
is the union of one man with one woman...

4
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:29,886
voluntarily entered into for life...

5
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:32,972
to the exclusion of all others.

6
00:00:36,493 --> 00:00:38,961
- Mickey here is...
- What's going on here?

7
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,730
What in God's name is happening here?

8
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:43,690
That is my wife!

9
00:00:43,773 --> 00:00:46,606
- I love the suit.
- You married us last week.

10
00:01:41,573 --> 00:01:44,371
You enjoy seeing me in a wedding dress,
don't you?

11
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:45,727
Just a little bit.

12
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,964
What about a Spanish Prisoner?
We haven't done one of them in years.

13
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,965
We could always live together first,
see how it goes.

14
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:54,969
We've got enough toasters, ain't we?

15
00:01:55,053 --> 00:01:57,487
I'm sick of getting married every week.

16
00:01:57,573 --> 00:02:00,770
- Next time, it can be someone else.
- What about a Leighton Buzzard?

17
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,525
Well, that was fun.

18
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,891
I haven't run like that since 1972.

19
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:09,127
- We screwed up, Michael.
- Yes, we did.

20
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:12,446
I talked to a man about a horse yesterday.

21
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:14,251
- No, Albert.
- No, Albie.

22
00:02:14,813 --> 00:02:16,212
What do we do now, Mickey?

23
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:19,968
We keep calm and trust our talent.

24
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,163
Libation for a shocked body.

25
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,611
Who's that?

26
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:45,164
The woman you're gawping at,
who is she?

27
00:02:45,253 --> 00:02:48,165
She is "Mrs. Katherine Winterborn...

28
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:51,290
"recently divorced from
Stephen Winterborn, businessman.

29
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,768
"She denied killing his dog
in a fit of pique."

30
00:02:53,853 --> 00:02:55,605
She killed the bloke's dog?

31
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:58,685
"In the ensuing divorce,
she took her husband to the cleaners...

32
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,970
"leaving him the bare bones
of their hotel and spa business...

33
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,489
"and an empty dog basket."

34
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,565
What am I thinking, Albert?

35
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:15,884
You're thinking about doing the Congreve.

36
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:17,201
I am indeed.

37
00:03:18,493 --> 00:03:21,212
- What's the Congreve?
- William Congreve. Playwright.

38
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:25,127
"Heaven has no rage
like love to hatred turned

39
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:29,202
"Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned"

40
00:03:31,013 --> 00:03:33,732
We're going to stitch up
a vengeful woman.

41
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:38,203
<i>Okay. Danny, Stacie,</i>
<i>book into Winterborn's London spa...</i>

42
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,922
<i>and see what information you can get</i>
<i>out of Katherine's former staff.</i>

43
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:44,929
<i>Katherine Winterborn</i>
<i>emerged triumphant...</i>

44
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:48,323
<i>from recent bitter divorce proceedings</i>
<i>against Stephen Winterborn...</i>

45
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:52,167
Who managed to maintain sole control
of the Winterborn chain of spa hotels...

46
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:54,767
which Stephen is about to float
on the stock exchange.

47
00:03:54,853 --> 00:03:56,491
Daniel, what did you learn?

48
00:03:56,573 --> 00:03:59,929
Well, I spoke to one of the therapists.
Very sweet girl.

49
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:07,172
In my country,
the water wouldn't be so warm.

50
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:14,287
Mrs. Winterborn
was a stickler for discipline.

51
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,933
Strict. Aloof. Cruel when she felt like it.

52
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:18,731
Sacked staff at the drop of a hat.

53
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,804
But very good at her business.

54
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,453
Stacie? Anything else?

55
00:04:24,493 --> 00:04:27,166
<i>She had a very volatile relationship</i>
<i>with her husband.</i>

56
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:32,645
One day she cut up all his suits and he
retaliated by ripping up all her drawings.

57
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,247
They had a row.
He went away on a business trip...

58
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,767
and she had his Labrador put down
by the vet.

59
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,811
Shouldn't have killed that dog.

60
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:43,169
- So the dog was the last straw?
- No, the lift was the last straw.

61
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:46,848
She took an ax to his favorite car,
he goes mad, locks her in a lift.

62
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,242
You can't really blame him, after the dog.

63
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:51,642
Except he knew
that she was claustrophobic.

64
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,729
She pushed him so far,
he eventually flipped.

65
00:04:58,813 --> 00:05:01,043
Gave her everything
at the divorce settlement...

66
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,044
just kept the spa-hotel chain.

67
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,169
All right. Tell me about the drawings.

68
00:05:05,253 --> 00:05:08,370
She attends art classes twice a week.
Crazy about it.

69
00:05:08,453 --> 00:05:10,284
I think I'm going to enjoy this.

70
00:05:10,373 --> 00:05:14,161
Yeah. Well, you be careful, Albie,
because she is a real psycho bitch.

71
00:05:15,493 --> 00:05:17,324
What are you doing, Eddie?

72
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,926
Found this old cocktail book
down the Charing Cross Road.

73
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:24,244
- Angel's Tit. Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

74
00:05:26,133 --> 00:05:28,249
Incredible. Moment of pure joy.

75
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,972
When he was younger,
Albert was the doyen of the Congreve.

76
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,931
He could smell out a vengeful woman
like a pig with a truffle.

77
00:05:34,013 --> 00:05:35,412
What a man.

78
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,811
Excuse me.

79
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:39,890
- Where are you off to, Ash?
- Out.

80
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:41,645
You got a mystery woman stashed away?

81
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,167
Yeah, we're not good enough for her, Ash?

82
00:05:44,373 --> 00:05:46,011
Where does he keep going off to?

83
00:05:46,133 --> 00:05:47,407
That's his business.

84
00:05:47,493 --> 00:05:49,131
I wonder how Albie is getting on.

85
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:05,965
Excuse me. It's my first time.
I'm a little nervous.

86
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,572
Are you talking to me?

87
00:06:07,653 --> 00:06:10,486
- Yeah. I was saying it's my first time.
- Please don't.

88
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:15,569
Good evening. Let's make a start, people.

89
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,412
- Damien? Welcome to the class.
- Thank you.

90
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:22,644
So, if you won't mind undressing,
we'll get started.

91
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,206
- Excuse me?
- Please.

92
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:27,444
The new boy or girl, they always
model on their first class.

93
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:29,808
- It's just our little tradition.
- Okay.

94
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:31,611
Damien, your robe?

95
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,127
Mickey.

96
00:08:03,053 --> 00:08:05,009
You remember June, don't you?

97
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,091
Yeah, thanks.

98
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:13,129
Mickey Stone. You look fabulous.

99
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,285
- So do you.
- Liar.

100
00:08:18,213 --> 00:08:19,407
What happened, June?

101
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:22,087
Too many years
head-butting moving vehicles.

102
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,448
She was doing the flop
up until a month ago.

103
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:26,808
The plate in her head moved...

104
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,566
That's too bad.

105
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:32,090
- But Ash has been looking after you?
- Only the best.

106
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:35,962
Tell him I'm not his responsibility.
That ended the day we divorced.

107
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:40,052
Sorry, I can't do that, June.
Besides, it wouldn't be true.

108
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,761
Not you, too?

109
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:44,566
You're family.
And families take responsibility.

110
00:08:44,653 --> 00:08:47,326
And they share that responsibility.

111
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,687
I wanted to tell you, but...

112
00:08:48,773 --> 00:08:50,365
- Ash?
- Yes, love?

113
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:53,732
- Who's that man?
- Why, that's Mickey.

114
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,402
- You remember Mickey.
- Get him out!

115
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:04,012
It's okay.

116
00:09:07,373 --> 00:09:10,604
- That wasn't exactly what I expected.
- Really?

117
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:13,411
May I see?

118
00:09:15,373 --> 00:09:18,922
It's good. I'm always looking
for fresh blood, a fresh eye.

119
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:21,841
I own a small gallery in Knightsbridge.

120
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:23,730
Is that supposed to impress me?

121
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,929
Not at all. I just thought you might...

122
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,562
I'm an amateur. I know what I am.

123
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:33,322
Not from looking at your work tonight.
I would actually disagree.

124
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:34,892
Then you're an idiot.

125
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,009
Believe me,
I'm never wrong about these things.

126
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:39,812
Perhaps I could take you out for a cup of...
We could...

127
00:09:39,893 --> 00:09:42,248
Do you know why
I come to this drawing class?

128
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:43,727
I imagine because...

129
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:47,010
It's the one thing I do
where I can lose myself for a blissful hour.

130
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:50,051
If I wanted an elderly roué
with an art gallery hitting on me...

131
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,442
I'd go to Venice. Do you understand?

132
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:54,444
- Perfectly.
- Good.

133
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:05,044
Some days she's fine.

134
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:10,052
Then, suddenly, the fog will come down
and she gets confused, upset.

135
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,330
She will get better?

136
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:18,607
It's partial brain damage, Mickey.

137
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:28,203
And you've been paying for that home
all this time?

138
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:31,887
Yeah, until the end of next week.

139
00:10:32,613 --> 00:10:34,569
Then the money runs out.

140
00:10:35,813 --> 00:10:37,531
Then what happens?

141
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,163
- There are cheaper places.
- No way. Not for June.

142
00:10:45,013 --> 00:10:47,322
I remember when you two married.

143
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,167
It just wasn't something we ever did.

144
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,327
Well, you married Rachel.

145
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:58,883
Yeah, I know.
But she wasn't one of us, you know.

146
00:11:00,213 --> 00:11:02,329
And I remember what you said:

147
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:06,611
"Just because we do what we do
doesn't mean we have to be lonely."

148
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:10,603
I admired you for saying that.

149
00:11:14,293 --> 00:11:16,648
Are you going to tell the others?

150
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,602
She's going to get
the best care there is, Ash...

151
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,332
which means
we're going to need a lot of money.

152
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:26,406
But don't worry.
Albert is out there doing the business.

153
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:28,211
We'll be all right.

154
00:11:28,973 --> 00:11:33,046
Katherine Winterborn
is an ogre of gargantuan amplitude.

155
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,043
You still think she's our mark?

156
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:38,249
She's rich, she's bitter...

157
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,689
and with the right key,
she'll open up like a butterfly.

158
00:11:41,773 --> 00:11:42,967
Any boyfriends?

159
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,442
No. At least none that we know of.

160
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:48,327
That would be like
sleeping with a Nile crocodile.

161
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:50,563
Well, there's your in, then.

162
00:11:50,973 --> 00:11:52,804
- You think?
- I know.

163
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,526
What, sex?

164
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,484
Wait. Please, just a second.

165
00:11:59,573 --> 00:12:01,928
June means a lot to me. I proved that...

166
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:03,964
No, not you, Albie.

167
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:07,892
You're far too precious
to be sullied in that way.

168
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:11,010
Sorry, put your trousers on.
I'm ready and I'm bang up for it.

169
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:15,769
No, we don't send boys to do a man's job.
Right, Michael?

170
00:12:15,853 --> 00:12:16,888
No, we do not.

171
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,931
Mickey can spin his charm
and still keep his trousers on.

172
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,446
It's his great gift.

173
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:25,321
You two go back to the spa,
get every piece of information you can.

174
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,683
I'll arrange a meeting
with Katherine Winterborn.

175
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:49,530
- I'm looking for Mr. Elliot.
- Mrs. Winterborn?

176
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:52,844
He said to say to meet you
in the Horizon Lounge.

177
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,163
- Where are the stairs?
- It's on the <i>4</i>0th floor, madam.

178
00:12:57,253 --> 00:12:59,608
The lifts are just through there.

179
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,763
- Problem with the middle lift, I hear.
- Excuse me?

180
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,812
We got a report from the duty manager
that the left central lift was juddering.

181
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,724
News to me. Let me call him.

182
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:51,532
It'll take me five minutes.
I can't just leave it.

183
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:55,606
Either I fix it or I shut it down.
It's all the same to me, sir.

184
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:57,963
- Go on.
- All right.

185
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,525
Mrs. Winterborn.

186
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:54,442
Sorry.

187
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:05,645
What's happening?

188
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:09,642
Hello?

189
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:10,802
<i>Sorry about this, sir.</i>

190
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,565
I'll have you moving in a while.

191
00:15:12,653 --> 00:15:15,929
Quick as you can, please.
I'm late for a meeting.

192
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:18,083
Isn't that always the way?

193
00:15:19,373 --> 00:15:20,442
Are you all right?

194
00:15:20,533 --> 00:15:24,321
No, I don't do lifts very well.
Can you hurry them, please?

195
00:15:25,373 --> 00:15:28,490
Look, could you hurry it up?
There's a lady in here feeling unwell.

196
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:30,484
<i>Yeah, it shouldn't be too long now.</i>

197
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,890
- What are you doing?
- You're panicking.

198
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:37,171
Now look at me. Look into my eyes.
Think of nothing and no one else.

199
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:40,731
- I'm going to be sick.
- Look at me. Here.

200
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:44,608
Very good. Now, think, you're very calm.
You're by a river bank.

201
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:48,971
The sun is dappling the water.
The water is dark green and very cool.

202
00:15:49,453 --> 00:15:52,206
There's a breeze playing with the rushes.
Can you hear it?

203
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,851
Yeah? Very good.

204
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:58,643
You're very calm as you sit by the bank
and splash your feet in the water.

205
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:02,011
Can you feel the cold water
against your skin?

206
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,162
Very good.

207
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:05,326
I spoke to the duty manager.

208
00:16:05,413 --> 00:16:09,167
There was this American businessman
in New York. Or maybe it was Chicago.

209
00:16:09,253 --> 00:16:10,447
Who called your company?

210
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,730
He got stuck in a lift for three hours.
No ventilation, no air con.

211
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:17,442
When they finally got him out,
his heart had exploded like a crisp packet.

212
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,649
Just hurry up and finish.

213
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,405
Terrible, it was.

214
00:16:24,973 --> 00:16:26,042
We're moving.

215
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:28,772
We are. We're okay. Stay with me.

216
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:33,043
Now we're gonna stand up, okay?
You're doing very well.

217
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:37,724
Here we go. Very calm. Breathe in and out.

218
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,891
That's very good.

219
00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,167
- You're gonna be all right now?
- Yes, thank you.

220
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:49,005
I think you owe this lady an apology.

221
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,163
As far as I'm concerned,
if I lose any money...

222
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:54,165
because I'm late for this meeting,
I will send you the bill.

223
00:17:06,613 --> 00:17:08,251
You forgot this.

224
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:10,808
Thank you.

225
00:17:10,893 --> 00:17:13,965
- And I wanted to thank you properly.
- There's no need, really.

226
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:15,771
I liked your river.

227
00:17:16,173 --> 00:17:17,572
Your river.

228
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,971
Now, if you'll excuse me...

229
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:22,611
- You're late for your meeting.
- Yes.

230
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:25,571
Can I buy you dinner tonight
as a thank-you?

231
00:17:27,893 --> 00:17:29,963
I'd be delighted.

232
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,611
Patrick Greene.

233
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:38,162
- Now get to your meeting.
- Yes.

234
00:17:49,733 --> 00:17:51,451
Orange juice. Ice.

235
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,169
Mineral-water ice cubes?

236
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,771
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you people...

237
00:17:58,853 --> 00:18:00,844
we don't do that anymore.

238
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:02,810
Sorry, sir, I didn't know.

239
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,088
Don't make me tell you again.

240
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,451
Sorry about that.

241
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:14,330
Can you imagine that?
Mineral-water ice cubes?

242
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:15,812
A bit extreme.

243
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:19,522
- Everything all right for you here?
- Great. Everything's perfect.

244
00:18:19,613 --> 00:18:21,365
- You the manager?
- No, I'm the owner.

245
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:23,489
- Stephen Winterborn.
- Cindy Moore.

246
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:25,962
- Lovely place you've got here.
- Thank you.

247
00:18:26,053 --> 00:18:27,202
Didn't I read somewhere...

248
00:18:27,293 --> 00:18:29,648
you're floating your business
on the stock exchange?

249
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,486
You must read the very small print
on the financial pages.

250
00:18:32,573 --> 00:18:33,688
I do.

251
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,924
Yeah, we're about to go public.

252
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:37,412
Exciting.

253
00:18:37,653 --> 00:18:39,006
I hope so.

254
00:18:39,093 --> 00:18:41,004
What do you do,
if you don't mind me asking?

255
00:18:41,093 --> 00:18:42,128
I work in the city.

256
00:18:42,213 --> 00:18:44,443
- Really? Doing what?
- Stephen.

257
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:50,371
- Nice to meet you, Miss Moore.
- Likewise.

258
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:52,929
Good luck with the launch.

259
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:03,089
- What can I get you?
- Dry martini.

260
00:19:03,173 --> 00:19:05,209
- Sir?
- Where's your still water from?

261
00:19:05,293 --> 00:19:07,761
- England, sir.
- Where in England?

262
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,446
- Herefordshire.
- That's fine.

263
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,728
No lemon. Two mineral-water ice cubes.

264
00:19:12,813 --> 00:19:15,611
Sorry, sir, we only have regular ice cubes.

265
00:19:15,693 --> 00:19:19,322
Made from water that has gone through
at least seven human beings.

266
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:21,131
No ice, thank you.

267
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:25,168
- What were you doing in Hong Kong?
- Making money...

268
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:28,370
seeing which way the wind would blow
once the Chinese took it back.

269
00:19:28,453 --> 00:19:30,887
- Which way is it blowing?
- Back to London.

270
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:34,682
What about you?
What do you do, apart from panic in lifts?

271
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,287
- You don't know who I am?
- Should I?

272
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:41,082
Every other person in here would.

273
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:45,603
I'm the evil bitch
who killed her ex-husband's dog.

274
00:19:45,773 --> 00:19:47,491
I read about that.

275
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,209
The press didn't like you very much,
did they?

276
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:53,488
I'll get over it, given time.

277
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,450
You can run away now.
I won't be offended.

278
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:58,286
I'm fine where I am. It's funny though.

279
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:04,125
- Don't you want to know about the dog?
- You'll tell me if you want to.

280
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,527
Excuse me, sir. Your table's ready.

281
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:10,008
<i>When did you start at the spa?</i>

282
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,046
Three months ago.

283
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,522
- Do you like it?
- It's all right.

284
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:18,403
You're pretty good with these balls.
You're a natural.

285
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:21,724
Let me get just a nice firm grip
on the end there.

286
00:20:22,093 --> 00:20:24,687
So who got you in the job
in the first place?

287
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,003
Let me push it through. Ready?

288
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,689
- Wow.
- Together.

289
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:34,329
- You ask a lot of questions.
- Do I?

290
00:20:34,413 --> 00:20:37,086
- Can I ask you one?
- Yeah, fire away.

291
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:39,004
What are you doing here?

292
00:20:39,093 --> 00:20:41,402
Just playing with balls with you.

293
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:44,650
Where is your sister?

294
00:20:45,253 --> 00:20:47,926
She's at the theater with some friends.

295
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,924
- That's a shame.
- Why?

296
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:52,931
She's pretty.
She could have come with us.

297
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:55,846
- Where are we going?
- To my place.

298
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:03,969
She wanted things I couldn't give her.
So she found someone who could.

299
00:21:04,053 --> 00:21:06,931
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- Yeah, like a razor.

300
00:21:07,013 --> 00:21:08,162
Kids?

301
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:12,204
She wouldn't have them
until I'd become what she wanted.

302
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,488
Would you take her back if she asked?

303
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,041
No, I could never give her
the things that she wants.

304
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:19,124
That wasn't the question.

305
00:21:22,213 --> 00:21:24,727
You said it was funny. What's funny?

306
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:28,326
I told you about my business
and you said it was funny.

307
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,768
- Oh, yeah. A coincidence.
- Tell me.

308
00:21:30,853 --> 00:21:32,889
It's business.
We don't want to talk business.

309
00:21:32,973 --> 00:21:34,964
I like talking business.

310
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:39,409
I'm setting up a luxury hotel complex
in the southeast.

311
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:43,042
We're starting with one, but we'll create
a major chain within five years.

312
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:46,045
You sound very confident.
It's a hard business to get right.

313
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:49,045
Some British businessmen in Hong Kong
are ready to come home...

314
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,566
and this is what they want to do.

315
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:53,884
Each man has put in
a minimum stake of £100,000...

316
00:21:53,973 --> 00:21:56,123
and my job is to get it up and running.

317
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:59,410
You'd be in direct competition
with my ex-husband.

318
00:22:01,013 --> 00:22:04,369
- Sorry about that.
- Don't be. I think it's hilarious.

319
00:22:04,853 --> 00:22:07,367
- How much more money do you need?
- We're all sorted.

320
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,284
- Fully funded?
- Why?

321
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,683
Thinking of irritating your ex-husband?

322
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:14,162
That would be petty, wouldn't it?

323
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:25,843
So he didn't serve your heart
on a bed of asparagus, huh?

324
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:29,528
No, not when she realized she could
use me to get back at her husband.

325
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:32,446
- She's an interesting woman.
- Interesting?

326
00:22:33,453 --> 00:22:35,489
What did you talk about?

327
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:37,370
Life, love, exes.

328
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,444
You talked to her about Rachel?

329
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,044
- You don't even talk to us about her.
- She asked.

330
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:45,086
Where's Danny?

331
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:47,604
He's working
the Russian girl from the spa.

332
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:49,923
She must be interesting, too.

333
00:22:51,053 --> 00:22:53,328
- Any hits yet, Ash?
- No, not yet.

334
00:22:58,613 --> 00:22:59,932
You're going?

335
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,243
Yeah, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

336
00:23:02,613 --> 00:23:04,046
Back to your sister.

337
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,812
Yeah, well, you know, she does worry.

338
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:09,448
Leave the money on the table.

339
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,652
Excuse me?

340
00:23:12,293 --> 00:23:13,442
£200.

341
00:23:15,573 --> 00:23:17,723
- You want money?
- Of course.

342
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:22,571
You're not a hooker, are you?

343
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,008
I don't mind what word you use.

344
00:23:25,213 --> 00:23:27,249
Hang on a minute.
I thought we were, you know...

345
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,051
You thought what?

346
00:23:29,813 --> 00:23:31,769
- I can't pay for sex.
- Why not?

347
00:23:31,853 --> 00:23:34,287
Because I'm, you know...

348
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,486
I mean, you know, it's not...
I'm not a payer-for-sexer.

349
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,813
Well, you have to.
If you don't, they'll cut me.

350
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:44,212
Who will?

351
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:46,531
People I work for.

352
00:23:56,253 --> 00:23:57,572
She's in.

353
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:04,403
- Where's she off to?
- Photograph of company directors.

354
00:24:05,013 --> 00:24:06,492
She likes you.

355
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,969
I do believe we have her.

356
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:30,131
Let's begin stage two.

357
00:24:34,813 --> 00:24:36,849
Well, what about that one?

358
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,046
Look at his shoes.

359
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:44,729
Handmade. Probably Jermyn Street.
It'll take too long to bleed him dry.

360
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:48,363
Well, I think... Oh, lovely.

361
00:24:48,733 --> 00:24:50,530
What about that one?

362
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:54,846
Too pretty. Pretty girls don't play poker.

363
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:59,043
I can't believe you said that.

364
00:24:59,173 --> 00:25:00,811
There's your mark.

365
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:05,205
Bohemian chic, roll-ups, odd socks.

366
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,048
Thinks he's an existentialist.

367
00:25:09,253 --> 00:25:11,767
Be like shooting a fish in a bowl.

368
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,124
I'll see you later then.

369
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:22,010
Great. Just what we're looking for.

370
00:25:22,093 --> 00:25:25,005
I've got the number
for the managing agents.

371
00:25:25,093 --> 00:25:27,209
- Have you?
- Yes.

372
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:30,648
I hate managing agents, Brian.

373
00:25:31,373 --> 00:25:33,045
- Do you?
- Yeah.

374
00:25:33,813 --> 00:25:37,567
But I've decided I like you.
I like you very much.

375
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,968
Most architecture students are only
interested in building skyscrapers...

376
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:46,486
and monuments to corporate greed.

377
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:49,133
Me, I'm about bringing
great design to the underclass.

378
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:52,125
Absolutely. Yeah, they're crying out for it.

379
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:55,762
- What are you studying?
- I'm sort of... Psychology.

380
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:58,049
That's a bit bourgeois.

381
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:02,692
You might say that,
but, you know, know your enemy.

382
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:05,765
Through a study of human psychology...

383
00:26:05,853 --> 00:26:10,847
I want to invert, to subvert,
the mind of the international capitalists.

384
00:26:11,693 --> 00:26:15,049
Laugh away, but let me
just give you an example of that.

385
00:26:16,973 --> 00:26:19,248
Never been very good with cards. I just...

386
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:23,087
It's the thing you got to clip...
Sorry, can't shuffle.

387
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:30,842
I'm gonna take five cards off the top here,
which I haven't seen. Fair enough.

388
00:26:30,933 --> 00:26:33,925
But take them. Just hold onto them.
Put them in your hand, yeah?

389
00:26:34,013 --> 00:26:36,573
From my knowledge of you,
I'm going to be able to tell...

390
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:40,123
just from reading your face,
which is the highest card...

391
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:42,852
in that hand. You ever been hypnotized?

392
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:46,762
Okay, just look at me.
Look at the cards, relax.

393
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,763
The first one is the highest.

394
00:26:53,213 --> 00:26:57,650
Sometimes it takes a while.
Don't block me, all right? Look at me.

395
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:02,321
The third card is the highest one.

396
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,690
What you got left?

397
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:12,650
It does work sometimes,
but I'm in the first year.

398
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:14,644
You are pretty good with cards,
aren't you?

399
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:17,008
Now, don't lie to me, I can tell.
No, you're good.

400
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,483
We should have a game of...
What's it called? Poker.

401
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,087
Ready?

402
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:28,693
Right, I'm gonna put £20 down.
How many do you want?

403
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,766
I got £20.

404
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:33,364
- Time for me to get out.
- Check.

405
00:27:33,453 --> 00:27:36,047
£20. In. I'll go for £10.

406
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:43,206
£20.

407
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,207
I'm out.

408
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,368
I'm out.

409
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:56,925
So what have you got?

410
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,086
Jack high.

411
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,927
Two pairs. Must be beginner's luck.

412
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:08,365
Which also means that you owe me
quite a lot of money.

413
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:10,603
You've cleaned me out, man.

414
00:28:11,053 --> 00:28:14,523
So are you any good?
You know, like, being an architect?

415
00:28:14,613 --> 00:28:18,003
The best in my year.
Look, I'll put my watch into the mix.

416
00:28:18,093 --> 00:28:19,731
I don't want your watch.

417
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:21,724
I don't have anything else.

418
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:25,044
There must be something you have
that I want...

419
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:28,330
some skill that you possess that I don't.

420
00:28:29,213 --> 00:28:30,692
Like what?

421
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,249
These are good, Danny.

422
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:40,249
He can't play cards,
but he does draw a lovely building.

423
00:28:43,813 --> 00:28:45,087
Michael.

424
00:28:48,613 --> 00:28:50,205
Here we go. Showtime.

425
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:57,371
I'd like to see Mr. Greene, please.

426
00:28:58,013 --> 00:28:59,207
Do you have an appointment?

427
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:02,330
Just tell him
Mrs. Winterborn is here to see him.

428
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:05,767
That's quite all right, Sharon. Hello again.

429
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,446
Come this way.

430
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:11,444
I thought about you last night.

431
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:15,370
It was a good night, wasn't it?
Please have a seat.

432
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,770
I'd like to see your site.

433
00:29:21,213 --> 00:29:23,249
- What for?
- Professional interest.

434
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:26,003
You know it's fully invested?

435
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,210
I'd still like to see your site.

436
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:32,647
Okay.

437
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:42,566
That would be the main accommodation
block there. Restaurant. Pool.

438
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:45,372
- Outdoor or indoor?
- One outdoor, one indoor...

439
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:48,572
both flanked by the treatment rooms.

440
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:51,125
It's a beautiful place.

441
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:54,330
Good road and rail access.
Airport in half an hour.

442
00:29:54,413 --> 00:29:55,846
- Planning permission?
- All sorted.

443
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,810
- Staff?
- Already started headhunting.

444
00:29:57,893 --> 00:29:59,565
Hard to find good people.

445
00:30:00,573 --> 00:30:02,086
Yeah, but not impossible.

446
00:30:02,453 --> 00:30:04,284
Your ex-husband has loads.

447
00:30:06,413 --> 00:30:08,051
I'd like to see your architect.

448
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,812
- But we've discussed this...
- Indulge me.

449
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,123
Call it professional interest.

450
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,088
This way.

451
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,010
I'm impressed
you got planning permission.

452
00:30:20,093 --> 00:30:23,403
- It wasn't easy.
- Bugger off! You're trespassing! Get off!

453
00:30:24,653 --> 00:30:27,645
All I'd say is don't scrimp in the building
and development.

454
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,406
It's easy to do, the costs spiral...

455
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:32,644
and the marble effect looks nearly
as good as real marble. Don't do it.

456
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,689
And definitely don't cut costs
in the bedrooms.

457
00:30:34,773 --> 00:30:37,970
They should be better than guests
have at home, not worse. Furnishings.

458
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,964
It will be unrivaled, I give you my word.

459
00:30:40,053 --> 00:30:43,045
And on opening day
you can be my guest of honor.

460
00:30:43,613 --> 00:30:47,322
I'd love to see his face when he finds out
I'm involved with the competition.

461
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:50,371
- He will be furious.
- But, Katherine, with all due respect...

462
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:52,723
you're not involved with the competition.

463
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:55,373
I'm going to invest £100,000
in your business.

464
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,522
You can't do that.

465
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:58,251
No one knows more about this than me.

466
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:01,405
Let me invest £100,000
and I'll be your consultant for free.

467
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:06,291
- Are you sure it's what you want?
- Positive.

468
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,809
I'll bring the papers over tomorrow.

469
00:31:10,253 --> 00:31:13,006
- Two glasses of champagne, please.
- Okay.

470
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,045
Okay, furnishings.

471
00:31:16,133 --> 00:31:18,693
Good. Would you put that
straight in the van?

472
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:22,686
Brian, thank you so much.

473
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:25,367
You're a star. Thank you for that.

474
00:31:57,493 --> 00:31:59,723
I'm sorry I've wasted your time.

475
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,803
What made you change your mind?

476
00:32:02,893 --> 00:32:06,283
For months now,
the first image in my head when I wake...

477
00:32:06,373 --> 00:32:10,969
is of him and his little girlfriend,
smiling and laughing...

478
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:14,001
enjoying the lifestyle I've created.

479
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,084
I hate him. I want to hurt him.

480
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:19,646
Katherine, all you have to do...

481
00:32:19,733 --> 00:32:22,042
But that's no way
to live the rest of my life.

482
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,727
Eaten away with anger and bitterness.

483
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,604
That way he wins again.

484
00:32:30,173 --> 00:32:33,006
It would have been fun to work with you,
I'm sure of that...

485
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,004
but it would have been wrong for me.

486
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:38,324
I need a fresh start and this isn't it.
I'm sorry.

487
00:32:39,133 --> 00:32:42,887
- I can't persuade you?
- I know you won't even try.

488
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:53,123
I hope it works out for you.

489
00:32:54,533 --> 00:32:57,605
Thank you. I owe you a lot.

490
00:33:03,293 --> 00:33:07,127
About the dog, it was hit by a car...

491
00:33:08,013 --> 00:33:10,481
and was in great distress.

492
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:15,321
The vet said it should be put down,
and I made that decision.

493
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:18,682
So you let her walk away?

494
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:21,128
I gave her an out, like always.
This time she took it.

495
00:33:21,213 --> 00:33:24,285
How hard did you try and persuade her?
That's the point.

496
00:33:24,373 --> 00:33:27,649
A lot of work has gone into this, Michael.
People have expectations.

497
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,201
The great Mickey Bricks, falling for a mark.

498
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,443
It's a question of ethics.

499
00:33:32,533 --> 00:33:35,127
- Ethics? What bloody ethics?
- Calm down.

500
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:39,252
- We're con men, for Christ's sake!
- We do not cheat honest people.

501
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:41,765
What about June?

502
00:33:44,693 --> 00:33:47,810
We'll think of something. We always do.

503
00:34:13,413 --> 00:34:16,883
- Fancy a Slow Comfortable Screw, Ash?
- No, thanks, Eddie.

504
00:34:32,293 --> 00:34:33,362
Hello?

505
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,683
<i>Sorry to phone you so late,</i>
<i>Mrs. Winterborn.</i>

506
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:39,766
But I'm afraid that the midwife won't be
able to get out to you in the morning.

507
00:34:39,853 --> 00:34:42,287
- What midwife?
<i>- The district midwife.</i>

508
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:44,648
I think you must have the wrong number.

509
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:48,806
<i>Mrs. Stephen Winterborn.</i>
<i>Date of birth: September 13, 1983.</i>

510
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:52,010
<i>Your husband brought you in yesterday,</i>
<i>according to our records.</i>

511
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,323
<i>Mr. Winterborn no longer resides</i>
<i>at this address.</i>

512
00:34:54,413 --> 00:34:56,404
Never call this number again.

513
00:35:08,413 --> 00:35:09,926
What made you change your mind?

514
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:12,129
When I was 23, I got pregnant.

515
00:35:12,213 --> 00:35:14,727
It was a complete accident, unplanned.

516
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,532
But when I found out, I was so happy.

517
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:19,972
I told Stephen and he just said:

518
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:22,851
"But we're not going to have children.
We agreed."

519
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:25,211
And he was right.

520
00:35:25,453 --> 00:35:28,206
We agreed the business would come first.

521
00:35:28,933 --> 00:35:31,401
But I couldn't help feeling elated.

522
00:35:31,813 --> 00:35:33,246
What happened?

523
00:35:34,013 --> 00:35:36,891
We talked about it. He decided...

524
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:42,771
He bullied me until I had an abortion.

525
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:46,044
And that was that for me.

526
00:35:46,373 --> 00:35:47,408
I'm sorry.

527
00:35:47,493 --> 00:35:50,530
Now I hear he's got his little tart pregnant.

528
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,842
I'll give you £100,000 worth
of investment...

529
00:35:54,933 --> 00:35:57,527
and you give me free rein over the spa.

530
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,410
I'll make it sparkle.

531
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:02,083
How did you find out she was pregnant?

532
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:06,206
I got a call by mistake from the hospital.

533
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:08,691
What time was this?

534
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,005
Late last night.

535
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:28,252
Don't go.

536
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:31,172
I have to.

537
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:34,203
I haven't signed the contract.

538
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,009
And you're not going to.

539
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,845
What do you mean, Patrick?

540
00:37:39,933 --> 00:37:42,572
It's just not the right thing for you to do.

541
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,931
I don't understand.

542
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,126
Trust me on this.

543
00:37:47,293 --> 00:37:49,682
When am I going to see you again?

544
00:37:50,973 --> 00:37:53,965
Katherine,
you're never going to see me again.

545
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:56,368
Why?

546
00:37:56,773 --> 00:37:59,162
That's just the way it has to be.

547
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,006
I'm sorry.

548
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:13,888
You're done with me, are you?

549
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:18,161
Stupid, bitter woman,
good for a shag and a few quid?

550
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:26,971
There is no hotel, Katherine.
No spa, no investors.

551
00:38:27,213 --> 00:38:29,169
My name is not Patrick.

552
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:33,564
Some associates and myself
picked you out as a potential victim.

553
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:37,362
You were rich, bitter, angry, obsessed.

554
00:38:38,453 --> 00:38:40,603
You were ripe to be plucked.

555
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:42,571
You're a con man.

556
00:38:44,373 --> 00:38:48,048
But I will not let you be our mark.
I won't be a part of it.

557
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:00,708
Wait.

558
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,475
You were setting me up.

559
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,028
I was.

560
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,429
You con people for money,
that's what you're saying?

561
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:12,468
You're all the same, all of you.

562
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,193
£200,000.

563
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,631
- I'll give you £200,000.
- There is no spa.

564
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,754
Who said anything about a spa?
I want you to destroy my ex-husband.

565
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,071
A rat to catch a rat.

566
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:29,232
- Don't do this.
- £250,000. What's your price, scumbag?

567
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:31,398
I want to see him humiliated.

568
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:34,190
No, it's not what we do.

569
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,430
It's one thing
conning a nasty piece of work.

570
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,589
She is a nasty piece of work.

571
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,069
It's quite another
destroying a man's life for a fee.

572
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,390
What's this bloke like
she wants to destroy?

573
00:39:44,479 --> 00:39:48,518
- He's all right. A bit full of himself, but...
- No, he's not pleasant, actually.

574
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,157
Forced her to have an abortion...

575
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,037
ran off with a younger model,
and promptly got her pregnant.

576
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,030
- You haven't even met him.
- I know his type.

577
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:56,552
Then why are we talking about it?

578
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,870
If he's that bad, he doesn't sound
any different from any other con.

579
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:01,312
And there's June to think about.

580
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,311
No, she wouldn't want us to do anything
just because of her.

581
00:40:04,399 --> 00:40:05,991
I would, though.

582
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:11,072
Okay, then we have to move fast.

583
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,990
He's floating his business in two days.

584
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:14,876
- That's when we get him.
- What's the in?

585
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,712
I have no idea.
He's a very careful man, by all accounts.

586
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:20,393
- Women?
- He's had two in his whole life.

587
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:21,468
Revenge.

588
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,312
If we let him know
his wife is setting him up for a fall...

589
00:40:24,399 --> 00:40:25,957
we might hook him in that way.

590
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:28,314
- I don't want her involved.
- Bloody hell, Mickey.

591
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,709
There must be something.
A hole in his wall.

592
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:35,307
We don't have very long to find it.

593
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,352
You wanna keep your voice down?

594
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:47,670
The great Danny Blue
paid for it with a Russian hooker.

595
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,196
- How much was it, Danny?
- Can you please just shut up?

596
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,314
Is it enough?

597
00:40:52,399 --> 00:40:55,391
A prostitution racket
being run from his hotel spa?

598
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,668
Lt'll crucify him.

599
00:40:56,759 --> 00:40:59,193
- So what do we do now?
- We need proof.

600
00:41:04,959 --> 00:41:06,915
No. No way.

601
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:09,559
Come on, you did it once.
What's the difference?

602
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,675
I didn't know she was a hooker then, did I?

603
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:14,229
I've got a reputation to think of.

604
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,391
Every silver cane has a grubby end, Danny.

605
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,514
- And when needs must...
- You grab the grubby end, Danny boy.

606
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,033
- No.
- Danny, we need you.

607
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:29,317
If you can't get something concrete
from this woman...

608
00:41:29,399 --> 00:41:31,594
this whole thing falls down.

609
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:37,992
All right.

610
00:41:38,399 --> 00:41:42,756
But, I mean it, listen, no one is to know
anything about this.

611
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,878
Cheers, Danny.

612
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:49,591
Eddie, Danny pays for sex.

613
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,592
Taxi!

614
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:16,908
Hello!

615
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,111
Stephen Winterborn.
We met at one of my spas.

616
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,310
Oh, yeah. Hi. Of course.

617
00:42:22,399 --> 00:42:25,197
The man who hates
mineral-water ice cubes.

618
00:42:26,799 --> 00:42:29,154
- Which way are you heading?
- Back to the city.

619
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:31,548
Me, too. Shall we share the cab?

620
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,198
Yeah, okay.

621
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:42,473
You never told me
what you did in the city.

622
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,914
- You never asked.
- I did, actually.

623
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:49,117
I monitor new flotations. Advise my board
whether they should invest in them or not.

624
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,633
What would you advise your board
about me?

625
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:52,947
I don't know, really.

626
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,270
I normally follow much bigger
flotations than yours.

627
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,508
- No offense.
- None taken.

628
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:03,548
So where are you having the launch?
Went to a lovely one at the Docklands.

629
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:04,833
At the spa.

630
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:08,713
- Nice.
- You think I should have done more?

631
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,869
The most important thing
is the presentation.

632
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:13,871
I got my usual PR firm
to knock something up.

633
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,631
"Knock something up"?

634
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:19,553
Stephen, this is the most important
moment of your business life.

635
00:43:20,439 --> 00:43:23,112
I've got a friend I think you should meet.

636
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:26,238
They're early.

637
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:32,350
The man is nothing short of astonishing.

638
00:43:32,439 --> 00:43:34,395
Cindy, what on earth are you doing here?

639
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,798
I want you to meet my friend.

640
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:38,268
I've heard great things about you,
Mr. Cavendish.

641
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:39,792
I'm working.

642
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:43,992
Sorry. He's a brilliant PR, but very rude.

643
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,312
I want you to have a look
at Stephen's presentation.

644
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,515
Now why would I want to do that?

645
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:52,274
Because I'm asking you nicely.

646
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:02,632
<i>... experience, which pampers</i>
<i>and relaxes...</i>

647
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,836
<i>while at the same time,</i>
<i>refreshes and energizes.</i>

648
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:08,992
<i>Each of our spas</i>
<i>offers a unique experience.</i>

649
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,867
<i>But the one thing they have in common</i>
<i>is indulgence.</i>

650
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:15,519
<i>Winterborns Hotel and Spas.</i>

651
00:44:17,719 --> 00:44:19,949
- What do you think?
- Very nice.

652
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:22,753
Reminds me of those ads you have
in provincial cinemas.

653
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:25,956
"The Taj Mahal Indian Restaurant,
just moments from this cinema."

654
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:29,915
Mr. Cavendish,
can't you just fizz it up a bit?

655
00:44:29,999 --> 00:44:31,990
No, I don't do fizz.

656
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,151
Come on, Mr. Cavendish.
I'll make it worth your while.

657
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,672
So, what's up?

658
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,353
Open it.

659
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:44,474
So how many of the other girls
are turning tricks?

660
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,073
Only the Russian ones,
and the Lithuanians.

661
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:49,070
And the Ukrainian girl.

662
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,873
What would the management do
if they found out?

663
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:53,790
They're the ones who organized it.

664
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:55,437
You sure about that?

665
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,275
The Mafia guy in Moscow told me
there is a job opportunity in England...

666
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:01,668
- and I jumped at it.
- The Mafia?

667
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:05,474
So the management of the hotel
are making a lot of money out of you girls.

668
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:08,119
We have to service
at least three clients a week.

669
00:45:08,279 --> 00:45:09,553
Service?

670
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:19,638
- Nervous?
- A bit.

671
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:22,153
Don't be. It's all under control.

672
00:45:22,439 --> 00:45:24,748
And I hear it's a big year for you.

673
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,749
You and Charlotte.
The pitter-patter of tiny feet.

674
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:31,433
- Who told you that?
- I heard it on the grapevine.

675
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,432
It's highly unlikely. I've never been able
to have children. Excuse me.

676
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:49,070
For God's sake, be more bloody careful.

677
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:10,915
Lovely night for an execution.

678
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:13,513
- No doubts?
- He's a bastard.

679
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,553
This is how you deal with bastards.

680
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:35,072
Ladies and gentlemen.

681
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,468
Hello. Excuse me.

682
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:40,509
Hi. Thank you all for coming.

683
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,756
Tonight is the proudest night of my life...

684
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:51,833
to be surrounded by friends,
honored guests, and the woman I love.

685
00:46:54,399 --> 00:46:57,948
It's taken a lot of people a lot of work
to get where we are tonight.

686
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,394
I want to thank them all
from the bottom of my heart.

687
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:02,788
Thank you very much, everybody.

688
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,394
But tonight is just a start,
the first step on a magnificent journey.

689
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:14,073
And now a short presentation. Enjoy.

690
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,191
<i>Winterborns Hotel and Spas,</i>
<i>a retreat away from daily life.</i>

691
00:47:20,279 --> 00:47:22,998
- Something doesn't smell right.
- What is it?

692
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,195
Stephen said that he can't have children.

693
00:47:25,639 --> 00:47:29,598
- No, he told her to have an abortion.
- I know. Somebody's lying.

694
00:47:35,399 --> 00:47:37,594
Who? Yeah, speaking.
Wait, I can't hear you.

695
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:40,635
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

696
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:43,392
Bloke from the office says
he found the earring you lost.

697
00:47:43,479 --> 00:47:46,676
- But I haven't lost an earring.
- She hasn't lost an earring.

698
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:48,112
Which one?

699
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,428
It's not the nice lady. It's the nasty lady.

700
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:52,918
Okay, thank you.

701
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:54,877
She went back to find the earring.

702
00:47:55,479 --> 00:47:57,231
I was here earlier.

703
00:47:57,479 --> 00:47:59,709
Well, at least I think I was.

704
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:02,710
I dropped an earring.

705
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,790
- There's nobody here.
- Where is everyone?

706
00:48:04,879 --> 00:48:08,315
They were only here for a day.
Nice people, though.

707
00:48:11,919 --> 00:48:13,750
<i>She's known who we are all along.</i>

708
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:16,753
<i>This is how you deal with bastards.</i>

709
00:48:17,959 --> 00:48:21,156
<i>Our beauty therapists</i>
<i>are specially trained.</i>

710
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,391
<i>From all corners of the former</i>
<i>Soviet Union, they come to work...</i>

711
00:48:25,479 --> 00:48:27,151
<i>to work as prostitutes.</i>

712
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:30,675
<i>The Mafia guy in Moscow told me</i>
<i>there was a job opportunity in England...</i>

713
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:32,351
<i>and I jumped at it.</i>

714
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,868
<i>They cannot speak out without fear</i>
<i>of violence and punishment.</i>

715
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:40,395
<i>Winterborns, where exploitation...</i>

716
00:48:40,479 --> 00:48:43,516
- Ash, stop it.
- It's too late. I can't.

717
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,954
We're destroying an innocent man.

718
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:49,517
For Christ's sake,
will you stop the presentation?

719
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:52,473
I don't know anything about that.

720
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:57,749
I'll try and explain this as well as I can.

721
00:48:58,159 --> 00:48:59,512
Watch the suit.

722
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:04,517
None of this is true.
I know nothing about this.

723
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,952
Excuse me.

724
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,992
How could you do this to me? Why?

725
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:22,949
<i>Lovely night for an execution.</i>

726
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:32,230
I owe you all an apology.

727
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:35,635
I let my guard down, and I got caught.

728
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:38,875
And the con man got conned.

729
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,836
Never let a mark get under your skin.

730
00:49:43,919 --> 00:49:45,637
I know, and I'm sorry.

731
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:47,710
I promise you all
it will never happen again.

732
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:50,029
Anyway, what about the £250,000?

733
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,508
It's in our account, every penny.

734
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,755
- Have you told June?
- Yeah.

735
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,673
- Mickey, I just want to...
- No, Ash. She's family.

736
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:01,556
I spoke to my friendly DI in Vice...

737
00:50:01,639 --> 00:50:04,995
told her Stephen Winterborn knew
nothing about the prostitution racket.

738
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:06,990
So at least he won't be charged.

739
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:08,148
Thanks, Stacie.

740
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:12,869
But they'll charge Mickey's woman
for running a brothel out of the spa.

741
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:14,278
Yeah, if they can find her.

742
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:17,078
She's emptied her accounts
and left the country.

743
00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:18,832
What a woman.

744
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,671
She really had you fooled, didn't she?

745
00:50:20,759 --> 00:50:24,388
- Okay, I made an error of judgment.
- Yes, you did.

746
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:27,954
"Say what you will, 'tis better to be left

747
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:29,438
"Than never to have loved"

748
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:31,874
William Congreve, playwright.

749
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:33,914
Oh, no.

750
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:37,196
- What is this, Eddie?
- The Congreve.

751
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,230
It's made with a lot of bitters.

752
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:43,117
Get it? Bitters. Bitter women.

753
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:47,829
I'd like to propose a toast.

754
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:58,991
- To living and learning.
- To falling in love with marks.

755
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,876
At least he didn't have to pay, Danny.

756
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,756
What's the toast, Ash?

757
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:05,952
To family.

758
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:15,191
<i>That's disgusting.</i>

759
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:06,228
English
