<i>Previously on <b>Desperate Housewives</b>:

2
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:04,400
Hey, Maisy.

3
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:05,900
Are you having an affair with my husband?

4
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:07,868
<i>Mistresses were confronted.

5
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:09,400
Very good to be back.
- What's that?

6
00:00:09,435 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm on house arrest.
It's a condition of my bail.

7
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,700
How will you work?
- I can't. I can't do anything.

8
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,000
<i>The tables were turned,

9
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:16,700
Lord, that's Angela.

10
00:00:16,735 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>and secrets from the past...

11
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm afraid you're mistaken.
My wife's name was Mary Alice.

12
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>...caught up with everyone.

13
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm such an idiot!
And you're such a liar!

14
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:27,200
Oh, and apparently a killer!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>Throughout even the most respectable of neigbourhoods,
you can hear the sound of scandal.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,700
<i>Some scandals announce themselves with a shout, ...

17
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:51,100
Ida!
Ida Greenberg, that is not your paper!

18
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,000
<i>...some with a whisper...

19
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:57,500
Throw me a 20, and I'll hook you up with free porn.

20
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,900
<i>...and some with a bang.

21
00:01:01,935 --> 00:01:04,700
Get the hell out of my life!

22
00:01:04,735 --> 00:01:08,300
<i>And once in a great while,
there comes a scandal

23
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:13,900
<i>so deliciously sordid
its roar drowns out all other noise.

24
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:18,000
Does your husband know how many men
pay for the privilege of sleeping in this bed?

25
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:21,200
There's not a lot of sleeping going on.

26
00:01:21,235 --> 00:01:24,500
Not if I'm doing my job right.

27
00:01:24,535 --> 00:01:27,300
So, how do you want to get started?

28
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,500
With these.

29
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:34,000
Well! That's gonna cost you extra.

30
00:01:34,035 --> 00:01:37,600
Maisy Gibbons, you're under arrest for solicitation.

31
00:01:37,635 --> 00:01:37,700
What?

32
00:01:37,735 --> 00:01:40,000
Please don't place your hands on the bed.

33
00:01:40,035 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm sorry, I have to ask you to leave. Now.

34
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:44,900
Hey!

35
00:01:44,935 --> 00:01:45,700
Get off me!

36
00:01:45,735 --> 00:01:48,600
This is entrapment!
- Right.

37
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:50,900
You all are making a gigantic mistake.

38
00:01:50,935 --> 00:01:54,500
Yeah.
Hey fellows, there's one for your memoirs.

39
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,600
Hey!

40
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:01,100
Come on, lady!
- No! Don't you touch me!

41
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:04,100
Get your hands off me!
- Take it easy, Ms Gibbons.

42
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:08,500
<i>Yes, the scandalous arrest of Maisy Gibbons

43
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>would soon prove to be the shot
heard round the world.

<i>-- Episode 16 --
THE LADIES WHO LUNCH

45
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,900
Take it easy now.
- Don't you put me in here!

46
00:02:56,935 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>It is often said that good news travels fast.

47
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:04,000
<i>But as every housewife knows,
bad news moves quite a bit faster.

48
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:09,600
Tish? Hey.
You are not going to believe this.

49
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:12,300
Maisy Gibbons was arrested.
- You cannot be serious.

50
00:03:12,335 --> 00:03:17,100
Did you hear about Maisy?

51
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:20,800
Maisy Gibbons running in handcuffs?
I'd have killed to see that!

52
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,500
Stay put, I'll be right back.

53
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:26,800
Ladies, please calm down now.
This is just a precaution.

54
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,600
If you'll just take a flier, we can work together --

55
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey guys.
What's going on?

56
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:33,600
Oh, there's been an outbreak of head lice.

57
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:34,200
Head lice?

58
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:38,900
These fliers detail all important information
concerning the situation,

59
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,900
including the recommended delousing combs.

60
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:44,500
Delousing? Did they have to
make it sound so disgusting?

61
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:45,600
Does anybody know where it started?

62
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm sorry, that's confidential.
Barcliffe maintains a strict "no blame" policy.

63
00:03:50,835 --> 00:03:52,000
Guys, over here!

64
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,500
Parents have a right to know
who brought this into our school!

65
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,900
Please calm down, Ma'am. Our position is
there's nothing to be gained by pointing fingers.

66
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:09,600
To identify the child who initiated the outbreak
might result in him/her being subjected to ridicule.

67
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:12,200
I -- excuse me.

68
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,900
If you'll just take a flier --

69
00:04:13,935 --> 00:04:18,800
Stop scratching! Stop!
Let's go!

70
00:04:18,835 --> 00:04:21,100
Hey! Stop scratching!

71
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:26,300
See you later.
- Bye!

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,100
What the hell --

73
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,200
Gabrielle!
- What?

74
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,600
Gabrielle!
I think we got a problem here.

75
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:51,600
I can't hear you.
- I think we got a problem.

76
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:55,700
The water's backing up here.
- What?

77
00:04:55,735 --> 00:04:59,300
Is that sewage?

78
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:01,900
Yeah, that's sewage.

79
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:07,200
Mike, the suspense is killing us.
Why don't you tell us the bad news.

80
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:11,600
Your outtake pipe is completely corroded.
That's why it collapsed.

81
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:13,800
We'll have to tear it out,
re-pipe the whole system.

82
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:17,000
And how much will this cost?

83
00:05:17,035 --> 00:05:22,700
I'll do it at cost,
but you're still looking at 6-7 grand minimum.

84
00:05:22,735 --> 00:05:27,700
OK -- Well, we'll let you know.

85
00:05:27,735 --> 00:05:29,200
If money is an issue --

86
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,200
Oh, no, no.
It's not the money. It's just --

87
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:37,400
We were trying to prioritize
some little things we need to do around the house.

88
00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:40,900
And do you consider sewage backing up in the house a priority?

89
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:46,600
It's definitely on the shortlist.

90
00:05:46,635 --> 00:05:48,200
Right.

91
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:51,100
I was surprised you called me.
- Why?

92
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:58,500
Well, ever since my arrest
nobody here wants to have to do with me.

93
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:03,600
Innocent until proven guilty, my man.

94
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:06,800
I hope he's more innocent than you.

95
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:12,100
Hey, it's Lynette. I know you're down about Mike,
but you gotta come to poker.

96
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:17,600
It'll be worth it.
I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons.

97
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:23,100
Hey Susan, it's me.
I really wish you'd return my calls.

98
00:06:23,135 --> 00:06:26,500
We need to talk.
I know I messed things up --

99
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:28,200
You OK?

100
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:30,600
Hi.

101
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:32,500
I can stay home if you want.

102
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:36,800
No. I know how much you were
looking forward to this weekend with your dad.

103
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm fine.

104
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,100
You don't look fine.

105
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:43,400
Well -- a little sad.

106
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,000
Mike and I were just a fling.

107
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:50,600
And not even a full fling.
Sort of a borderline fling.

108
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:53,000
Mom, anyone can see how much you loved him.

109
00:06:53,035 --> 00:06:56,500
I also loved junk food,
and I gave that up and survived.

110
00:06:56,535 --> 00:07:01,300
There's your father.
Go have fun.

111
00:07:01,335 --> 00:07:10,700
Last chance. You sure?
- I'm sure. Now go!

112
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:28,900
You'll find someone else, Mom.
Someone great. I know.

113
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,200
What's wrong, Rex?
Didn't you enjoy your golf game with Dr Wallace?

114
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:39,700
I didn't play.
Still feeling sluggish.

115
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:41,900
Still?
Did you talk to him about that?

116
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:45,300
Of course. He doesn't understand
why the medication isn't working.

117
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,300
He asked me to come for a checkup tomorrow.

118
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,100
Tish is making her round.
She must have some juicy new anecdote.

119
00:07:54,135 --> 00:07:57,600
Get here over here.
I could use a funny story today.

120
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:01,300
Tish! Tish!

121
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:04,500
I can tell by that look on your face
you've got something good.

122
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:06,600
Come on, don't be selfish!

123
00:08:06,635 --> 00:08:12,200
First off -- you're not friends with Maisy Gibbons, are you?

124
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

125
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank god, because this is too good:

126
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:18,100
Maisy was arrested.

127
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:22,300
While Harold was at work, she was
having sex with men in her house for money.

128
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,700
Can you imagine?

129
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,200
No, I can't.

130
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,200
That's not even the best part. Word is,

131
00:08:30,235 --> 00:08:36,400
she had a little black book
with all her clients' names.

132
00:08:36,435 --> 00:08:39,800
So -- you think that'll get out?

133
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:41,100
Of course. These things always do.

134
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:46,500
Nancy, wait up.
I can't wait till I tell you this --

135
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:52,800
You heard your funny story, Rex.
Why aren't you laughing?

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,700
I'll get it.

137
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,800
Hello?

138
00:09:07,835 --> 00:09:12,300
Hi Tammy.
- Can we see one of the bugs?

139
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,500
Yeah, here. See?

140
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:19,000
It's this little white thing.
It looks like a sesame seed.

141
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,200
It's cool.

142
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,000
There's lots more
where that came from.

143
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:25,100
I'm so sorry.
You must be so disappointed.

144
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:30,900
But we'll get all the boys together
once Topher is back on his feet.

145
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:31,900
What did Tammy want?

146
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:36,600
She's cancelling Topher's birthday party on Sunday.
He's come down with the measles.

147
00:09:36,635 --> 00:09:40,700
Measles, huh?
- Yeah. What?

148
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:45,300
Tammy Brandon spent a fortune on Topher's birthday.

149
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:49,700
She'd call in specialists from Switzerland
before she'd let it be cancelled.

150
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:51,300
Why would Tammy lie to us?

151
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:55,500
Because she saw Porter scratching his head.
They all did.

152
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:57,200
Now word's getting around.

153
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,600
Why is everything a conspiracy theory with you?

154
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:01,400
Lots of kids get lice.
Not a big deal.

155
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:04,600
Well, it is for the rich B-I-T-C-H-es
at Barcliffe Academy.

156
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:08,900
It's been one day, and they were disinvited to a birthday party.

157
00:10:08,935 --> 00:10:13,800
Rumours start flying, these boys can
kiss camp-outs and pool parties goodbye.

158
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:18,570
Uh-oh.
- Not so cool now, huh?

159
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,800
It's all here.
Appraisal, title search, escrow documents.

160
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm sorry I changed my mind,
but this isn't a good time to sell the house.

161
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,700
Zack's going through a lot. He wants to
finish high school before we're moving.

162
00:10:30,735 --> 00:10:35,200
Forget this part of the business.
I expect to get screwed over.

163
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:39,200
Now where is your house key?

164
00:10:39,235 --> 00:10:43,200
I must have left it at home.
I'll bring it by tonight.

165
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:47,200
No one will be here. Zack's on a school trip,
and I'm going to Mt Pleasant on business today.

166
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:49,100
Just drop it by tomorrow.

167
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,900
Or, I could just keep it.

168
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,800
What?

169
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a joke, Paul.

170
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:59,900
I know your wife's dead and all, but --
it's been six months! Lighten up!

171
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:02,100
Hello.
- Felicia.

172
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,800
Oh, hi, Felicia.

173
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:07,800
Edie, I found this in my sister's things.
It has your name on it.

174
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:12,800
Aw, my necklace!

175
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:18,200
I've lent this to Martha 3 months ago.
She said it went down the drain!

176
00:11:18,235 --> 00:11:22,400
I miss how we used to steal things
from one another.

177
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:27,400
So Felicia, I heard they have a suspect
in your sister's murder?

178
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:28,700
Mike Delfino?

179
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,600
Oh, he didn't kill her.

180
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:32,500
But they found her jewelry in his garage.

181
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,600
But his fingerprints were not on the evidence.

182
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:36,500
That just means he wore gloves.

183
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,776
So he's smart enough to use gloves, but

184
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:43,842
he leaves her blood-spattered jewelry
lying around for anyone to find?

185
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:48,500
Please! Is that what you do
if you kill someone?

186
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,900
I don't know
what goes through the mind of a murderer.

187
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm just saying I wouldn't trust him
if I were you.

188
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,600
Evie. That is lovely.
Is it an antique?

189
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:02,700
Yeah, I think so.

190
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:07,100
I know a story you would love.
It specializes in antique jewelry.

191
00:12:07,135 --> 00:12:10,100
It's in Salt Lake City.
Have you ever been there?

192
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:16,100
No, I try to steer clear of Utah.
It's a little too -- conservative for me.

193
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,700
Too bad.

194
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,400
Have you ever been, Paul?

195
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:21,800
No.

196
00:12:21,835 --> 00:12:28,000
It's lovely. I used to live there.
When I was a nurse.

197
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:32,300
You should definitely go sometime.

198
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:34,000
Bye.

199
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,200
<i>With no indoor plumbing,
Gabrielle was forced to improvise with her personal hygiene,

200
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:50,400
<i>whereever and whenever she had the opportunity.

201
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Sorry.

202
00:12:53,035 --> 00:12:58,000
That's OK.
I was just about to give a Maisy Gibbons update.

203
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:03,800
Guys, we should be ashamed
for reveling in that woman's misery.

204
00:13:03,835 --> 00:13:06,800
That being said, Edie, please continue.

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:14,900
Well. I hear from a very reliable source
that Maisy will cut a deal with the prosecution.

206
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:20,700
Apparently, she has some high-profile johns
and the DA is looking for a second term.

207
00:13:20,735 --> 00:13:25,300
I don't get it.
I don't get who would pay Maisy for sex.

208
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:28,600
Obviously someone
who is not getting it at home.

209
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:34,900
The upshot is: Maisy will turn over
her little black book with all her clients' names.

210
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,900
Really?

211
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:42,000
Yep. Can you imagine the fallout
when this goes public?

212
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:46,000
Blood on the walls.

213
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm all in.
- I'll call.

214
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:57,382
Bree?
- What just happened?

215
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,170
Stakes were raised.
- Yes, yes, they were... I've called.

216
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:11,892
I can't believe how lucky you were today.
- Luck had nothing to do with it.

217
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,259
I had crappy cards, I was bluffing the entire time.
- Really? Wow, you're good.

218
00:14:16,534 --> 00:14:20,234
That's the only nice thing I could say about my first husband:
he told me how to bluff.

219
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,877
He played poker?
- No, he was lousy in bed.

220
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,214
I had to fake a lot of orgasms.

221
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,710
You don't have to respond.
- Thank you.

222
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:39,347
So where was Susan today?
- I'm not sure.

223
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:45,201
Wow, Tom must be great in bed.
- Huh?

224
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:51,561
Obviously you have no idea how to bluff.
- OK. She's going through something she prefers to keep private.

225
00:14:51,562 --> 00:15:01,949
She's upset with Mike, isn't she?
Come on, I'll find out sooner or later!

226
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:09,498
She's devastated about the breakup and hasn't left the house in days.
- Why didn't you just tell me that?

227
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:15,216
Because it's personal; it's something
she would only want me to tell her friends.

228
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:16,959
I'm Susan's friend.

229
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:20,871
What? I don't hate her.

230
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:28,107
Edie, if you want me to share stuff with you,
start to be more supportive with Susan.

231
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,800
OK. How?
- What do friends do?

232
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:38,769
They call; they're sympathetic; they ask about the pain
the other one is going through; and then -- they listen.

233
00:15:40,758 --> 00:15:44,758
But what if you want to be supportive
but just can't stand listening to people bitch?

234
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,057
Then it's good to know how to bluff.

235
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:09,565
Congratulations!
- Thank you!

236
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:16,558
Thank you! It's very exciting.

237
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,011
I really think you deserve this award.

238
00:16:39,018 --> 00:16:41,818
God, I have to go to the bathroom again.
- Go to Bree's.

239
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:45,211
Been to Bree's twice today.
- Then go to Susan's.

240
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:50,023
I hate Susan's. She has all these weird scented candles.
Her house reeks of apricot. Hose!

241
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,400
What about Lynette's?
- I don't want to go to anybody's house anymore.

242
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,690
I'm tired of knocking on doors, making up excuses
why we haven't fixed our plumbing.

243
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,059
Why are you yelling at me?
- Because it's your fault.

244
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,780
My fault?
- If you hadn't gotten yourself indicted, we would have pipes.

245
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:10,981
I got indicted trying to make enough money to keep you happy.

246
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:13,881
In case you hadn't noticed,
you're a little materialistic.

247
00:17:14,178 --> 00:17:17,478
I'm materialistic? When the Johnsons bought their new 7 series,

248
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,529
you traded in your car for something better.
- Who ended up driving it?

249
00:17:21,865 --> 00:17:25,415
I don't have time to fight.
I have laundry to do.

250
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:39,046
Nurse Abigail?
- Mrs Scavo, right? The twins' mother?

251
00:17:41,838 --> 00:17:44,138
I just wanted to tell you
that the boys are now

252
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:46,534
uh -- lice-free.
- Good to hear.

253
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:56,742
I just can't figure out how it happened.
They get a bath every night. Trust me.

254
00:17:58,292 --> 00:18:00,342
It's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day.
- I believe you.

255
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:07,887
I keep thinking maybe it was the petting zoo
I took them to last week.

256
00:18:08,603 --> 00:18:12,803
That llama was really iffy.
- Mrs Scavo, it doesn't work that way.

257
00:18:13,479 --> 00:18:17,529
Lice only spread from human to human.
Even the cleanest kid can get it

258
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:20,071
if he gets too close to the wrong kid.
- Really?

259
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:25,913
Yes. So don't be so hard on yourself, uh?
- I guess. Still I feel a little guilty.

260
00:18:27,989 --> 00:18:30,989
After all, my kids started an entire lice outbreak.

261
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,922
Look, your kids didn't start it.
- They didn't?

262
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,908
No! I know that Patient Zero was another little boy.
It's his 4th time with this problem.

263
00:18:48,805 --> 00:18:50,505
Oh! There's a load off my mind.

264
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,172
Well, thank you.

265
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:02,764
So which kid is it?
- I can't tell you. You know we have a "no blame" policy.

266
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:08,328
We have to protect the children. You'll understand.
- Of course.

267
00:19:10,925 --> 00:19:13,825
No, I don't. You have to give me a name.
- Mrs Scavo...

268
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,575
Here's the thing: acting like parents won't assign blame is like

269
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,725
pretending they don't keep score at PW League games.
It's human nature.

270
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,975
If you don't give the mob someone to blame,
they pick a scapegoat.

271
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,825
I can't let my boys be the scapegoats.
- Please don't put me in this position.

272
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,525
I'm begging you. We've already been uninvited
from a birthday party, a really big one

273
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,975
with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown...

274
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:37,976
I wish I could help you.

275
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,970
For god's sake, and a magician!
Tammy Brandon went all out.

276
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,724
Tammy Brandon? Topher's mother?
- Yes.

277
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,940
Now isn't that interesting?

278
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,228
Have a seat.

279
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:06,381
<i>Meanwhile at the Fairview County prison,
Maisy Gibbons was delighted to hear she had a visitor.

280
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:12,775
<i>But she was soon reminden one should always be aware of visitors...

281
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,125
<i>bearing gift baskets.

282
00:20:16,228 --> 00:20:17,478
You gotta be kidding me.

283
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:20,302
Hello Maisy.

284
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,940
Stuff like this is why I love you.

285
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:17,785
What brings you here?

286
00:21:20,367 --> 00:21:22,467
I need a favor.
- I thought as much.

287
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:29,258
I heard there is a little black book
with the name of your clients in it.

288
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:31,944
There is.

289
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:37,573
I was wondering if perhaps
you could remove Rex's name.

290
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:43,384
Wow, that's a big favor.
Those muffins better be really good.

291
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:50,763
I have some money I have been putting aside for emergencies.
It can be yours if you just...

292
00:21:53,574 --> 00:21:54,874
Keep my mouth shut?

293
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:58,747
Continue to be discreet.

294
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:03,905
Gosh. I don't know.

295
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,336
I don't think it's asking much.
Just remove one little name.

296
00:22:10,939 --> 00:22:14,489
But if I do it for you,
I have to do it for all the other wives.

297
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,930
That wouldn't be fair, now would it?

298
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,725
Maisy! Please! We used to be good friends!

299
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:28,653
Where were you when Harold lost his job a year ago?
Did you stop by to offer your help?

300
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:33,486
Did you bring a big basket of baked goods
when we couldn't even pay our bills?

301
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:37,646
If you did, those displays of friendship
must have slipped my mind.

302
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:45,495
Maisy, I didn't mention your financial troubles
because I thought

303
00:22:47,204 --> 00:22:50,654
it would embarass you.
- Yes, but it would have been much better than silence.

304
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,859
I have $14,000 in that account.
It can all be yours.

305
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,315
I'm not interested.

306
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:14,711
But you do get credit for one thing:
you came to visit me.

307
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,590
Even if it was for an ulteriour motive.
None of the girls in the club even bothered.

308
00:23:22,393 --> 00:23:26,543
I've been abandoned. I guess that happens
when you become the town whore.

309
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:33,356
Oh sweetie, they didn't abandon you because you're a whore;

310
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,449
but because you weren't all that nice to begin with.

311
00:23:53,334 --> 00:23:55,784
Who is it?   - It's Edie!
- Edie, not now, I'm busy.

312
00:23:57,991 --> 00:23:58,991
Hi!
- Or just come on in.

313
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:03,867
What are you doing?
- I decided my life is way too complicated,

314
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:06,971
so I'm simplifying.

315
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:10,683
I'm getting rid of the clutter.
- Ooo.

316
00:24:13,617 --> 00:24:16,217
I was on vacation.
It made sense at the time.

317
00:24:18,384 --> 00:24:21,934
OK, not to be rude, but is there a reason you're here?

318
00:24:23,952 --> 00:24:26,652
I feel bad about what you're going through with Mike.

319
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,370
Don't worry, I won't date him.
- Doesn't matter any more.

320
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:34,135
Don't get me wrong: I still have every intention of sleeping with him.

321
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,419
Some mountains are meant to be climbed.

322
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,974
I need to learn to keep my doors locked.

323
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:46,528
How long have you been sitting here?
- I don't know, 5 minutes, give or take 3 hours...

324
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:49,781
That's it. Get up. Get dressed.
- Why?

325
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:55,142
Because you're coming with me.
It's time to get wasted.

326
00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:57,329
Happy hour started 45 minutes ago.

327
00:24:57,364 --> 00:25:00,471
Why would I go anywhere with you?

328
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:03,173
Because that's what normal women do
when they get depressed.

329
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,823
They put on short skirts,
they go to bars with their girlfriends,

330
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:10,273
maybe have one too many, and make out
with some strange man in the back of a dark alley.

331
00:25:14,498 --> 00:25:16,698
Wow.
- Oh come on. It'll be fun! I swear. Come on!

332
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:24,835
Why do you even care?
- I never said I cared. It's just --

333
00:25:27,155 --> 00:25:29,705
I guess I know what it's like
to have your heart stomped on.

334
00:25:36,123 --> 00:25:38,723
OK. Give me a minute to change my clothes.

335
00:25:41,046 --> 00:25:43,646
And don't forget to do something
with that skanky hair.

336
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:44,846
You're a little scary with them.

337
00:25:51,375 --> 00:25:52,875
Aah, look at him.
- Not my type.

338
00:25:56,564 --> 00:26:00,086
I know the pickings are slim,
but isn't there someone you're attracted to?

339
00:26:00,121 --> 00:26:01,155
I hate them all.

340
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:06,697
Look at them leering at us.
So damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand.

341
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:11,539
What? We have the upper hand.
Without us they have nothing.

342
00:26:11,574 --> 00:26:13,089
Maybe 15 years ago, not anymore.

343
00:26:15,503 --> 00:26:18,103
Now we're just lonely and desperate,
and they know it.

344
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,910
They just sit there ??weigh their pumps??.
Waiting for us to take any crumb

345
00:26:23,145 --> 00:26:25,295
they're willing to throw our way.

346
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,295
I don't want crumbs, I want Mike!

347
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,439
Hi! I'm gonna spending the whole night with her,
so I'll be needing a lot more of these.

348
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,360
I'm sorry. It's just so hard to find a guy like Mike.

349
00:26:40,617 --> 00:26:42,767
I know in my heart he didn't kill Mrs Hoover.

350
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,517
OK, let's say Mike's a peach
and he didn't kill Martha.

351
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,829
Who did?
- Obviously a bad guy, somebody really awful.

352
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:00,737
Somebody like -- Paul Young.
- Paul? -- Are you serious?

353
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:05,293
I'm telling you, he's hiding something.
He clams up everytime we try to ask about Mary Alice.

354
00:27:08,078 --> 00:27:10,778
And when we found out about Dina...
- Dina. Who's Dina?

355
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:15,394
Paul and Mary Alice had a baby that died!

356
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,318
You're kidding.
- Zach killed her.

357
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,950
Holy crap, who told you that?
- Paul! He said it was an accident, but

358
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:27,599
I think that's why
Mary Alice was being blackmailed.

359
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:29,304
Mary Alice was being blackmailed?

360
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:33,713
Yeah. The girls and I found
a threatening note in her stuff.

361
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,049
What the hell kind of street do we live on?
- I don't know.

362
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:45,835
Come to think of it: the other day
Paul was talking with Felicia,

363
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,410
and he was working overtime
to make Mike sound guilty.

364
00:27:49,952 --> 00:27:53,402
See? Shifting blame onto someone else,
that's classic criminal behavior!

365
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,254
I tell you, he's up to no good.

366
00:27:57,887 --> 00:28:01,587
Zach and Paul are out of town.
Maybe we could sneak into their house

367
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,419
and do some snooping. I have the key.
- Oh my god! Yes, we should do that!

368
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:07,519
I was just kidding.
- No, Edie, this is our chance.

369
00:28:07,554 --> 00:28:10,419
We should just go in for 10 minutes.
- That's breaking and entering.

370
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:14,469
Martha Huber was your best friend.
If we could find out who really killed her

371
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:16,019
wouldn't that be worth the risk?

372
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,133
Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

373
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:26,298
Serena, hi! How are you?

374
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,419
I talked to Dr Wallace today.
- Oh?

375
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:37,555
He still has no idea why the medication isn't working.

376
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,655
He told me he's thinking of running more tests.

377
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,805
I told him I'm thinking about getting a 2nd opinion.

378
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:49,651
Rex! This might sound silly, but
are people staring at us?

379
00:28:55,771 --> 00:29:00,479
Yeah. What's going on?
- I could be wrong, but I suspect that

380
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,914
Maisy Gibbons' client list has been released.

381
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:13,429
you think they're laughing at us?
- No, I think they're laughing at you.

382
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,871
I think they feel sorry for me,
which is just as mortifying.

383
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:18,821
What are we going to do?

384
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:24,879
Oh -- we act like nothing is happening,
and when we finish eating,

385
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:28,098
we will walk out of here
with all the dignity we can muster.

386
00:29:31,974 --> 00:29:36,374
Please, let's go now.
- Oh no. I refuse to give them that satisfaction. Open your menu!

387
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:39,678
Everybody's staring!
Bree, it's humiliating!

388
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:44,028
You should have thought about that
before you left a personal check on Maisy Gibbon's nightstand.

389
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:46,128
You stay here if you want to,
I'm leaving.

390
00:29:47,749 --> 00:29:49,949
Rex, if you walk out of this restaurant,
I will scream.

391
00:29:51,134 --> 00:29:52,484
Bree...
- I will scream about your cruelty,

392
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:55,577
then I will scream about your infidelity,

393
00:29:57,001 --> 00:30:00,951
and to make sure it really hurts
I will scream about your distasteful sexual habits.

394
00:30:02,727 --> 00:30:06,477
If you want to know what true humiliation is,
take just one step.

395
00:30:24,825 --> 00:30:26,325
So, what are you having?

396
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:28,151
The veal looks good.

397
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:41,669
What are we looking for, exactly?

398
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,719
An embroidered pillow that says
"I killed Martha Huber"?

399
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:46,952
You know, just something suspicious.

400
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:51,674
Mmmh, smells expensive.

401
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,699
Do you believe in evil, Edie?
- Of course I do. I work in real estate.

402
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:08,126
I'm serious. There's something about this house
that is so cold and creepy.

403
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:12,326
You couldn't tell when Mary Alice was alive.

404
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,550
She brought so much warmth and light.

405
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:19,868
Now there's something...

406
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,225
I could just taste it.
Can't you sense it?

407
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:27,521
The only thing I sense
is that you had too much to drink.

408
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:32,682
Something happened in this house.
Something so awful we can't even imagine it.

409
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,949
Oh! Son of a bitch!

410
00:31:38,242 --> 00:31:39,682
Are you OK?

411
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:42,855
I just stubbed my toe.

412
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,674
Oh my god, Angela!
- Huh?

413
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:48,708
Angela! That's what Mary Alice used to call herself!

414
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:49,858
What are you talking about?

415
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:53,008
We heard it on this tape
that Bree stole from her therapist.

416
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:56,608
It's a long story, I'll tell you later.
We gotta put this in.

417
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:01,878
What was that?
- I think it's Paul.

418
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:06,566
You said he was gone.
- I guess I was wrong.

419
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:11,045
Hurry!   - I gotta get the tape!
- Hide!

420
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:38,793
- Paul!

421
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:43,516
Edie! God, you scared me!

422
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:48,115
I'm sorry. I see you made it back from Mt Pleasant.

423
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:51,314
Yes. What are you doing here?

424
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,708
I came by to bring you your key.
I was about to leave you a note.

425
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,539
You're returning my key at 11.30 at night?
What the hell's going on here?

426
00:33:01,574 --> 00:33:04,389
You're right. We're too old to be playing games.

427
00:33:04,424 --> 00:33:05,639
What?

428
00:33:05,894 --> 00:33:09,344
My note was going to tell you that I --
I wasn't kidding this afternoon.

429
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:15,298
I really would like to keep a key to your place,
to use if the -- mood strikes me.

430
00:33:19,568 --> 00:33:23,618
You've been drinking.
- Just enough to get up the courage to tell you how I feel about you.

431
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:04,313
Obviously you're uncomfortable about this.
I'm really sorry if I embarrassed you.

432
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,679
Here's your key. I'll see you around.

433
00:34:09,204 --> 00:34:11,254
Edie, I -- I'm not embarrassed.
If anything --

434
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:16,931
I'm flattered.

435
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:28,886
Susan? Talk to me!
- Mike, it's not a good time, I'm a little drunk and a little freaked out.

436
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:31,066
Why didn't you return my messages?

437
00:34:31,347 --> 00:34:34,197
We're broken up!
I thought I made that pretty clear.

438
00:34:34,232 --> 00:34:35,847
Come on, can we work this out?

439
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:38,368
You lied to me!
- When? When did I lie to you?

440
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:40,568
The police showed me your rap sheet.
You killed a man.

441
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:43,218
You can't believe I'm some cold-blooded killer.

442
00:34:43,912 --> 00:34:47,412
Of course not, but I also didn't believe
Carl would cheat on me,

443
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:51,712
or that Mary Alice would kill herself.
Let's face it, Mike, blind faith is not my friend.

444
00:34:52,745 --> 00:34:55,395
I was going to tell you,
there just wasn't a right moment.

445
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,945
See, that's a lie too!
There were plenty of right moments.

446
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,295
Everytime we went out for pizza, you could have said
"Oh, by the way, I once killed a man."

447
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:07,195
Or when you said, "Hey, let's go jogging,"
you could have said,

448
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,395
"By the way, I once killed a man."

449
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:12,695
Everytime we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy,
you could have turned to me

450
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,245
and said, "By the way, I did that once."
You didn't!

451
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:17,641
Do you want to hear what happened or not?

452
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,680
It doesn't matter because I will never believe anything you say ever again.

453
00:35:38,406 --> 00:35:39,906
At least you can believe that.

454
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,939
Occupied!

455
00:36:00,612 --> 00:36:02,188
Carlos, I have to go!
- Well, you're gonna have to wait.

456
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:04,931
Why should I have to wait?
It's my porta-potty.

457
00:36:04,966 --> 00:36:06,881
What do you mean it's yours?
- I'm the one who stole it!

458
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:10,145
Babe, I'm sorry. You're just gonna have to wait.

459
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,579
Thank you very much, Bree.
Seeing your tile has helped me make my decision.

460
00:36:24,797 --> 00:36:27,147
Next time I remodel I'm using limestone.

461
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:30,976
Gabrielle, is everything OK?
- Sure, why?

462
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:37,566
It's just that you've been acting kind of odd lately.
- In what way?

463
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:51,387
You're coming up with excuses to use everyone's bathroom,
and 2 days ago Mr Kalli saw you and Carlos in your backyard,
doing the laundry in your jacuzzi.

464
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,360
Well, there's a simple explanation for that. I --

465
00:37:00,663 --> 00:37:01,637
Are you two having some sort of money trouble?

466
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:07,112
Gabby, it's OK if you are.
- Is that so?

467
00:37:09,525 --> 00:37:13,275
- Yes, and to tell you the truth, I'm a little insulted.
I'm a good friend.

468
00:37:13,538 --> 00:37:15,788
Why would you feel that you have to hide that from me?

469
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:21,385
I don't know, probably for the same reason you didn't tell me
Rex was one of Maisy's clients.

470
00:37:23,881 --> 00:37:25,281
That is obviously different.

471
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:29,193
Why? Because it happened to you?

472
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:36,921
Bree, this is how I see it:
Good friends support each other after they've been humiliated.

473
00:37:37,146 --> 00:37:40,546
Great friends pretend
nothing happened in the first place.

474
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:51,643
Well, then -- good luck on your remodel.
- And please tell Rex I said hello.

475
00:38:13,773 --> 00:38:15,093
Hey Tammy.

476
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:17,437
Lynnette!

477
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:22,453
I see Topher has made a speedy recovery!

478
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:25,162
Can we go playing?
- Sure, boys, have fun.

479
00:38:25,982 --> 00:38:28,132
Wow, let's go play in the buzz house!

480
00:38:31,164 --> 00:38:34,514
All right, you caught me. I lied.
But you have some nerve

481
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:36,714
crushing a 6 year old's birthday party.

482
00:38:39,922 --> 00:38:44,572
Just so you know, I got Topher a set of bongo drums.
I know you'll love them as much as he will.

483
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,280
Charlie, come on out!
I don't want you to play with the Scavo boys.

484
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:50,780
Mona, please, I'm sure they're clean.

485
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,376
You are not ruining my party.

486
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:03,779
Porter, Prustin, out out, let's go.
- No, not quite yet.

487
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,800
Boys, keep bouncing. That's right.
Oh, by the way, I spoke to nurse Abigail.

488
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:14,375
I know who Patient Zero is.
- All right, that's it kids, get out. Go!

489
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,680
How could you do that?

490
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:29,249
Look, this party meant everything to Topher.
I couldn't risk people not showing up. He would be devastated.

491
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:33,211
I had to do something.
- And the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fault?

492
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:36,078
Hey, I hardly had to say anything.
People were already suspicious.

493
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:41,052
Oh please.
- It's true. Your boys aren't the cleanest kids on the planet.

494
00:39:45,498 --> 00:39:47,798
That was not a smart thing to say.

495
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:53,446
Where are you going?
- I'm telling the truth to every mother out there, then I'll take back the bongos.

496
00:39:56,641 --> 00:40:00,241
Wait! OK, I was wrong, I admit it.
I am really really sorry.

497
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:02,796
Too little too late.

498
00:40:05,813 --> 00:40:09,613
OK, I'll tell everyone that I was wrong.
That your kids aren't the ones.

499
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:11,263
Please, I'm begging you!

500
00:40:14,602 --> 00:40:16,652
Well, why are you standing there?
Get to it.

501
00:40:32,165 --> 00:40:33,215
Bree, hi! What's up?

502
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,216
Well, I have been doing some thinking.

503
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:41,748
Rex and I have been members of the Fairview country club for years,

504
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:45,698
and lately it seems to have lost some exclusivity,
so I decided

505
00:40:45,961 --> 00:40:47,461
not to renew our membership.

506
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:51,635
I'd rather see the money go to someone I care about.

507
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,459
Oh Bree, I can't take that.

508
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:08,907
Gabby, this is the way I see it:
Good friends offer to help in a crisis.

509
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:10,752
Great friends

510
00:41:12,364 --> 00:41:13,714
don't take no for an answer.

511
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:26,172
We'll pay you back every cent, I promise.

512
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,001
Take your time.

513
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:38,903
<i>Yes, everyone loves a scandal,

514
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,714
<i>no matter how big or small.

515
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:54,160
<i>After all, what could be more entertaining
than watching the downfall of the high and mighty?

516
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:03,747
<i>What could be more amusing than the public exposure of hypocritical sinners?

517
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:10,389
<i>Yes, everyone loves a scandal,

518
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,763
<i>and if for some reason you're not enjoying the latest one,

519
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:18,993
<i>well --

520
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:23,213
<i>the next one is always around the corner.
