1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,539
告诉你个有趣的事实
Here's a fun Postal fact.

2
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:07,773
我们的信箱
Yeah, the inner side of our mailbox

3
00:00:07,797 --> 00:00:09,545
其实是受到联邦政府的管辖的
is under federal jurisdiction.

4
00:00:09,569 --> 00:00:11,615
所以如果你打断我的右手大拇指
So, if you broke my right thumb,

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,396
警察会来抓你
that's Pasadena city police.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,281
如果你打断我的左手大拇指
But if you broke my left thumb,

7
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,863
你就要被联邦调查局追查了
that's the FBI.

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:20,893
要是我打断他的手指就得坐牢 我宁愿杀了他呢
If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him, not breaking his thumb.

9
00:00:20,917 --> 00:00:22,201
是啊
No.

10
00:00:22,492 --> 00:00:24,968
哦 我奶奶给我写信了
Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,669
嗯 你闻闻
Umm. Smell this.

12
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:28,459
这是什么味道?
What is that?

13
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:31,189
玫瑰 万通筋骨贴 还有擦脚的足粉
Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Schools' foot powder.

14
00:00:32,137 --> 00:00:34,409
"奶奶" CK最新香水
Yeah, "Grandma", by Calvin Klein.

15
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,456
我收到的最后一封手写的信
Yeah, the last time I got a hand written letter,

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,653
上面说我停车跟瞎了一样
it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person.

17
00:00:41,677 --> 00:00:43,224
我知道是谁给你写的
That someone has a name.

18
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:44,921
呃 谢谢
Uh, thank you.

19
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,831
哦 奶奶买了一副新的假牙
Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.

20
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:51,825
哦 她找到她原来的那副了
Oh, but then she found her old ones.

21
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,441
哦 所以现在她只在去教堂的时候戴她的新假牙
Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth.

22
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:59,413
真有趣 就好像你有两副斯波克的耳朵
Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears

23
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:01,336
一副去漫展戴 一副在家里戴
and your around the house Spock ears.

24
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,591
我停车没问题啊
I park fine.

25
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,282
天啊 她要来看我!
Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!

26
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:12,718
哦 能和她见面肯定很棒
Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,486
你会爱死她的
Oh, you are going to love her.

28
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:17,289
她是全世界最和蔼 最可爱的女人
She is the kindest, sweetest woman you'll ever meet.

29
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,192
除非你是一只地鼠 在她的菜园子里钻来钻去
Yeah, unless you're a gopher digging up her vegetable garden.

30
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:22,595
如果你是的话 
In that case, you can expect

31
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:25,931
她就会用铲子砸碎你的脑袋
to have your head bashed in with a shovel.

32
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:29,568
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,905
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

34
00:01:32,907 --> 00:01:34,540
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

35
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:37,076
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

36
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:39,745
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

37
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:42,414
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

38
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,316
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

39
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:46,266
生活大爆炸 第九季第14集

不是她 不是她
That's not her. That's not her.

44
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:00,120
不是她 不是她
That's not her. That's not her.

45
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:02,122
不是她
That's not her.

46
00:02:02,124 --> 00:02:04,290
不是她 不是她
That's not her. That's not her.

47
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,159
- 不是她  - 真的?
- That's not her.  - Really?

48
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:08,361
这个老亚洲男人不是你奶奶?
The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?

49
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,032
你这样一点忙都帮不上
And that's not helpful.

50
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:14,934
我... 我圣诞节送了她一个iPhone
You know, I... I got her an iPhone for Christmas.

51
00:02:14,936 --> 00:02:16,403
我来看看她在哪里
I'll see where she is.

52
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,604
真不错
Oh, that's nice.

53
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,606
她这个年纪大多数人都不喜欢高科技的东西
Most people her age don't embrace technology.

54
00:02:19,608 --> 00:02:21,341
哦 她都不知道她有一个iPhone
Oh, no, she doesn't even know she has it.

55
00:02:21,343 --> 00:02:23,443
我让我妹妹把它放到她包里去的
No, I had my sister slip it in her bag

56
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:27,213
这样我们就可以用手机定位她了
so that I can track her like a sea turtle.

57
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,649
和你在动物园走丢的时候一样
Same as when we lost you at the zoo.

58
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:31,518
都说了一百次了
Uh, for the hundredth time,

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,887
我闻到爆米花的味道 但是找不到卖爆米花的车子
I smelled kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.

60
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:36,289
可是这也没法解释
Still doesn't explain

61
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,526
你为什么会跑到高速公路上去
how you ended up on the freeway divider.

62
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:41,628
我的小月饼!
Moon Pie!

63
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,829
奶奶!
Meemaw!

64
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:44,864
见到你我好高兴啊!
I'm so happy to see you!

65
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,166
我也好高兴啊!
I'm happy to see you, too!

66
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:47,400
哦
Oh.

67
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:48,668
你越来越小了
You got even smaller.

68
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,203
太棒了!
I love it!

69
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:52,205
呃 奶奶 这位是Leonard
Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard.

70
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:53,206
Leonard 这是我奶奶
Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

71
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:54,474
你好 见到你很高兴
Hi. So nice to finally meet you.

72
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,042
奶奶 我帮你提吧
Let me take this for you, Meemaw.

73
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,210
谢谢
Thank you.

74
00:02:57,212 --> 00:02:59,212
不行不行 你得叫她名字Constance
No. Oh, no. Now you call her "Constance."

75
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:00,680
我才能叫她奶奶
I call her "Meemaw."

76
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,948
你有自己的奶奶
You have your own Meemaw.

77
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,917
你奶奶在你四岁的时候就死了可和我没关系
It's not my fault she died when you were four.

78
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,987
这样对你的朋友说话真的好吗?
Is that nice to say to your friend?

79
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,889
不好 奶奶
It isn't, Meemaw.

80
00:03:09,891 --> 00:03:12,058
Leonard 对不起
Sorry, Leonard.

81
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:15,728
你能一直和我们住吗?
Can you please live with us forever?

82
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,098
哦
Oh. 

83
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,867
这太可笑了! 
That's ridiculous! If you had

84
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:23,336
如果你有超能力 你一辈子都听别人的话
a superpower, and spent your whole life

85
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,038
隐藏自己的能力
being told to suppress it,

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,474
当你终于决定接受自己超能力的时候
when you finally decide to embrace that power,

87
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:29,709
为什么要一个人躲起来?!
why hide in isolation?!

88
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,144
对不起
I'm sorry,

89
00:03:31,146 --> 00:03:34,781
那你写的冰雪奇缘拿了多少票房啊?!
and how much money did your version of Frozen make?!

90
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:37,484
我就是随便说说
I'm just saying,

91
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:39,152
她不该唱什么"让它去吧" 她应该唱
instead of "Let it Go," she should really sing,

92
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:41,454
"快来看我啊 我躲在冰箱里"
"Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar."

93
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,024
她用冰建造了一个城堡 造了一个雪人
She built an ice castle, made a snow monster

94
00:03:45,026 --> 00:03:48,027
一天之内就让自己变了样
and gave herself a complete makeover in one day.

95
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:49,729
看看你今天干了什么?
You know what I saw you do today?

96
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,198
你直接从包装里啃了一块奶酪奶油
Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil

97
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,701
还瞒着你妻子!
and lie about it to your wife!

98
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,138
不好意思 我听到了你们说的话 你知道吗
Sorry for eavesdropping, but did you know

99
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,773
他们在编出这个故事之前
they actually had the song "Let It Go" in place

100
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,408
就已经有"随它吧"这首歌了?
before they finalized the story?

101
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,844
是啊 说得对 实际上这首歌太受欢迎了
Yeah, that's true. In fact, they liked the song so much,

102
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,446
以至于他们为它重新编了个故事
they retooled the whole script around it.

103
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,381
所以那部电影才烂的要死
Which is probably why that movie sucks.

104
00:04:08,383 --> 00:04:10,617
咱们讨论的是"冰雪奇缘"
Here we are talking about Frozen,

105
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:12,018
而你 怒火中烧了吧
and yet, you got burned.

106
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,154
小姐 抱歉
Miss, I'm so sorry.

107
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,622
你怎么能够不喜欢那部电影呢?
How can you not like that movie?

108
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:17,624
我觉得这部电影过誉了
I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.

109
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:19,125
我一小时前就这么说过
Oh, that's what I said an hour ago.

110
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,896
哇 你俩讨论"冰雪奇缘"都讨论一小时了?
Wow. You've been talking about Frozen for an hour?

111
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:27,300
你该看看我们讨论恐龙当家的时候
You should've seen us after The Good Dinosaur.

112
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:31,137
这是一部发生在侏罗纪时代的西部片
It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period,

113
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,806
它改变了我的人生
and it changed my life.

114
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,112
环境舒适吗?
Are you comfortable?

115
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:40,813
非常舒适
Very.

116
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:41,748
爬完漫长的楼梯
It's nice to rest

117
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,317
还能坐下来歇歇挺不错的
after 800 flights of stairs.

118
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:49,689
你气喘吁吁的样子真是萌萌哒
You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.

119
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:52,458
Amy来了
There's Amy.

120
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,127
你知道你们肯定合得来
I just know you're gonna hit it off.

121
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,863
你俩的时尚感一模一样
You both have the same fashion sense.

122
00:04:57,832 --> 00:05:01,534
哈喽! 快进来 这是我的奶奶
Hello! Come in, say hi to my Meemaw.

123
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,002
嗨 很高兴见到你
Hi. Nice to meet you.

124
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:04,537
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you, too.

125
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,538
旅途怎么样?
How was your trip?

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,606
很棒
Wonderful.

127
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,341
飞行员非常专业
And the pilot did such a good job,

128
00:05:08,343 --> 00:05:10,043
我就奖励了他一颗奶油糖果
I gave him a butterscotch.

129
00:05:10,045 --> 00:05:12,011
太棒了
That's great.

130
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:14,447
瞧啊 你还坐在Sheldon的专座上呢
And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot.

131
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:16,049
我都没有资格坐在那呢
You know, I don't even get to sit there.

132
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:17,283
可不
Yeah.

133
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,985
你这辈子都别想了
And you never will.

134
00:05:18,987 --> 00:05:21,821
对了对了 让她表演纸巾那一招
Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing.

135
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:22,989
快点 和她说
Do it, ask her.

136
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,325
可以给我一张纸巾吗?
Can I have a tissue?

137
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,726
当然
Of course.

138
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:30,730
是不是很牛逼?
Isn't that the best?!

139
00:05:30,732 --> 00:05:32,899
她简直就是 "蜘蛛奶"
She's like Grandma Spider-Man.

140
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,602
他很小的时候
He's been saying that

141
00:05:35,604 --> 00:05:36,903
就爱这么说
since he was little.

142
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:39,405
我到今天都不明白这是啥意思
I still don't know what it means.

143
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,608
好啦 你俩坐下互相了解一下
Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other.

144
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,875
我去给你准备房间
I'll get your room ready.

145
00:05:42,877 --> 00:05:44,344
不许翻我的行李箱
Oh, now don't you go looking through

146
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,179
去找你的礼物
my suitcase for presents.

147
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:47,647
假如我翻了 能找到礼物吗?
If I did, would I find any?

148
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:48,881
大概吧
Maybe.

149
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:52,719
但是你也可能会翻到我的胸罩和灯笼裤
But you also might find my brassieres and bloomers.

150
00:05:53,755 --> 00:05:56,623
值得冒险!
That's a risk I'm willing to take!

151
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,157

281
00:11:07,073 --> 00:11:08,539

那个本王也做不到啊

00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:27,925
谁说我愿意跟他订婚来着？

00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:38,035
互相认识了不到一天
for less than a day,

298
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:40,838
但是有可能这场争执是因为
but is it possible this crankiness is because

00:11:50,549 --> 00:11:54,018
谢谢 我还是去隔壁跟Leonard玩吧
Thank you. I'm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.

305
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,657
你遇见了这个女孩 你们交换了电话号码
Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers,

306
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:01,091
而且你还打算再见她
and you're gonna meet up with her.

307
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,726
只是帮她写剧本而已
Just to help her with her screenplay.

308
00:12:02,728 --> 00:12:04,628
好吧 我想那也不算太糟
Oh. Well, I guess that's not so bad.

309
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,663
你又不在那儿
You weren't there.

310
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:06,897
他根本是在勾搭人家
He was really flirting.

311
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,833
美国女孩喜欢幻想
Hey, it's not my fault if American women project

312
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:11,235
带魔幻口音能实现愿望的异域人士
their fantasies on foreigners

313
00:12:11,237 --> 00:12:15,039
又不是我的错
with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes.

314
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,174
我相信没事的
I'm sure it was harmless.

315
00:12:17,176 --> 00:12:18,542
勾勾搭搭而已 没什么大不了
People flirt. No big deal.

316
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:20,511
真的吗? 如果我也...
Really? So it's okay if I fl...

317
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:22,680
你不行 你是本宫的人
Not you. I own your ass.

318
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,884
真正的问题是 你和Emily到哪一步了?
The real question is, where are you with Emily?

319
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:28,752
不好说啊
Uh, it's hard to say.

320
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,788
我觉得我们还好 可这样的事情
I think we're good, but things like this

321
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,257
总让我犹豫Emily是不是我的真命
make me wonder if Emily's really the right person for me.

322
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:35,326
我是说 你们有没有对彼此犹豫过?
I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?

323
00:12:35,328 --> 00:12:37,661
- 从来没有啊  - 肯定犹豫过
- No. Never.  - Absolutely.

324
00:12:37,663 --> 00:12:38,796
什么?
What?

325
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,997
Howie 你忘了
Howie, you forget

326
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:41,332
我们刚开始约会时
how much of our early dates

327
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:42,466
你不停表演魔术
involved you doing magic

328
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:44,168
而我总是像这样
and me doing this.

329
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:47,471
好吧
Fine.

330
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,606
我对你也是有保留的
I had reservations about you, too.

331
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:50,407
你没有
No, you didn't.

332
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,009
是啊 我没有
No, I didn't.

333
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,911
反正现在也无所谓了
Well, it doesn't matter now,

334
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,913
只要结局让我满意就行
'cause I love how things worked out.

335
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,047
我也是
Me, too.

336
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:58,949
我觉得你比这支玫瑰花
And I think you're even more beautiful

337
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,151
漂亮多了
than this rose.

338
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:09,393
最后一次看见我奶奶时
Wow. The last time I saw my grandma,

339
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,828
最有意思的事情是瞅着
the most exciting thing was watching the ash

340
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,596
她香烟的烟灰越来越长还不断好奇
of her cigarette get longer and wondering

341
00:13:12,598 --> 00:13:15,299
烟灰会不会掉进她的布丁里
if it was gonna fall in her pudding.

342
00:13:15,301 --> 00:13:17,034
掉进去了吗?
Did it?

343
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,035
正好掉进去
Yeah, right in there.

344
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:19,770
她还整个都吃了
She ate it and everything.

345
00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:22,006
Leonard和Penny开门
Leonard and Penny.

346
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,741
Leonard和Penny开门 Leonard和Penny开门
Leonard and Penny. Leonard and Penny.

347
00:13:23,743 --> 00:13:25,109
进来!
Come in!

348
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:26,410
怎么样了?
Hey. What happened?

349
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:27,611
Amy走了?
Is Amy gone?

350
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,346
没有 她们让我走开
No. They asked me to leave

351
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:31,081
以便单独沟通
so they could speak privately.

352
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,983
是啊 气氛蛮紧张的
Uh-oh. Yeah, I know. It was quite tense.

353
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:35,652
下面是最关键的问题:
So here's the million dollar question:

354
00:13:35,654 --> 00:13:39,390
谁打算冲进去把我的火车拿出来?
uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?

355
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:44,194
好吧 我决定了
All right. I've made up my mind.

356
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,030
我要做正确的事情 给这个女孩打电话
I'm gonna do the right thing, call this girl,

357
00:13:46,032 --> 00:13:47,865
告诉她我已经有人了
and let her know that I'm in a relationship.

358
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:48,999
目前我们已经听到的有
Okay, so far we've heard,

359
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,901
下定决心 甩了Emily
"made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily."

360
00:13:50,903 --> 00:13:52,636
下定决心 假扮孪生兄弟
"Made up my mind to date both of them

361
00:13:52,638 --> 00:13:55,572
脚踏两条船
by pretending to be twin brothers."

362
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:57,441
还有 下定决心
And "made up my mind,

363
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:58,609
提议同床御二女
"I'll ask for a threesome

364
00:13:58,611 --> 00:14:01,311
如果他们拒绝的话 就当成玩笑好了
and if they say no, play it off as a joke."

365
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,679
我在打电话了
I'm calling her.

366
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,916
而且御二女什么的也不至于让你笑破肚皮
And the threesome didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.

367
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:07,551
是啊
You're right.

368
00:14:07,553 --> 00:14:11,021
还是完全有可能的嘛
It could totally happen.

369
00:14:11,023 --> 00:14:12,089
喂?
Hello?

370
00:14:12,091 --> 00:14:13,657
我是Raj
Hi. Hi. Yeah, it's Raj.

371
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,592
Rajesh 我们在漫画书店见过
Rajesh. We met at the comic book store.

372
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:17,928
怎么样? 你什么时候有空吗?
Hey, what's up? Figure out what time you're free?

373
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,296
这正是我打电话的原因
Actually, that's why I'm calling.

374
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:20,664
我...呃...
I, um... I just...

375
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,333
我得告诉你我已经有女朋友了
I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend.

376
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:25,269
呵呵 行啊
Okay. Good for you.

377
00:14:26,072 --> 00:14:27,104
不是 不是
Well, no, no.

378
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:28,272
我不想在你约我出去后
I-I didn't want to mislead you

379
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:29,573
让你误会
after you asked me out.

380
00:14:29,575 --> 00:14:31,208
我没约你出去啊
I didn't ask you out.

381
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,077
你只要你帮我写剧本
I just need help with my screenplay.

382
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,612
你是说我们没来电吗?
Wait, are you saying that we didn't have a vibe?

383
00:14:35,614 --> 00:14:37,781
我们有没有来电有什么关系? 你有女朋友了啊
Why do you care if we have a vibe? You have a girlfriend.

384
00:14:37,783 --> 00:14:39,783
行了! 我只是告诉你我有女朋友了
Come on! I just told you I had a girlfriend.

385
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,705
你也至少可以告诉我我们来电
The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe.

386
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:44,688
行吧 我们之间来电
Sure, we had a vibe.

387
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:46,490
我就知道 我们确实很来电
I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe.

388
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:47,791
太激动人心了
This is exciting.

389
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:49,960
下一步我该怎么做？
What's my next move?

390
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:51,328
你依然是个有女朋友的人
You still have a girlfriend.

391
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,497
对 接得漂亮
Right. Good catch.

392
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,133
不管怎么样 很抱歉浪费你的时间
Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time.

393
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,768
呃... 祝你的剧本写作顺利
And, uh... and good luck with your screenplay.

394
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,103
等等
Hang on.

395
00:14:59,105 --> 00:15:00,504
我们都是成年人了
We're both adults.

396
00:15:00,506 --> 00:15:02,706
可以毫无深意地待在一块儿
We can still get together without it meaning anything.

397
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,075
我不行 自从你说出我们之间很来电那句话之后
Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe,

398
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:07,010
我已经在脑补我俩的婚礼了
I've been planning our wedding.

399
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:11,115
只是喝咖啡而已
Look, it's just coffee.

400
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,716
我会问你一些科学问题
I'll ask you some questions about science,

401
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:15,552
如果你向我求婚的话 我一定会拒绝
and if you propose, I promise to say no.

402
00:15:15,554 --> 00:15:18,789
好 有点伤人 但可以接受
Okay. That hurts a little, but okay.

403
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:21,024
太好了 回头给你发简讯
Great. I'll text you.

404
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:22,626
再见
Bye.

405
00:15:22,628 --> 00:15:23,927
好的
All right.

406
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:26,864
我们要像成年人一样喝杯咖啡
So, uh, we're meeting for coffee like two adults.

407
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:28,765
皆大欢喜 简单得很
Everybody's happy. Easy peasy.

408
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,400
你打算告诉Emily吗？
Are you gonna tell Emily?

409
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:31,535
当然
Yeah, of course.

410
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:33,003
我们之间没有秘密
We have no secrets.

411
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:35,539
你打算什么时候告诉她？
When are you gonna tell Emily?

412
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,609
奶油芝士的事他说谎了！
He lied about the cream cheese!

413
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,677
他把整块都吃掉了! 我亲眼看到了！
He ate the whole thing! I saw him!

414
00:15:43,516 --> 00:15:46,016
我知道你觉得我不适合Sheldon
Look, I know you think I'm not right for Sheldon,

415
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:48,018
但是信我吧 他也没多少选择了
but trust me, I'm his best shot.

416
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,521
你不知道我忍受了多少!
You have no idea how much I put up with!

417
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:52,789
我比你想象得知道的更多
I know more than you think I do.

418
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,925
真的吗? 你知道约会之夜被
Really? You know what it's like to have date night ruined

419
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:57,661
Google改变字体这件事毁掉是什么感觉吗?

420
00:15:57,663 --> 00:15:59,663
小妞啊
Young lady,

421
00:15:59,665 --> 00:16:01,331
如果你认为我不明白
if you think I don't know

422
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,566
和一个固执又自负的人生活在一起
what it's like to live

423
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,668
是什么感觉
with a stubborn, egotistical man,

424
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,003
那你就大错特错了
then you're wrong.

425
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,038
因为我的丈夫就是那样的
'Cause that was my husband.

426
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,773
真的吗?
Really?

427
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,744
有那么些日子我都想在他的口袋里装满玉米粒
There were days I wanted to fill his pockets with corn

428
00:16:13,746 --> 00:16:16,280
再把他丢到啄人的鸽群里去
and toss him in the pigpen.

429
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,349
如果你明白的话
Well, if you understand,

430
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:22,019
为什么又要为难我呢？
then why are you giving me such a hard time?

431
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,121
因为你和Sheldon分手的时候
Because when you broke up with Sheldon,

432
00:16:24,123 --> 00:16:25,422
他伤得很重
it hurt him deeply,

433
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,858
我不希望再看到这样的事情发生
and I don't want to see that happen again.

434
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,028
嗨 不好意思
Hi. Sorry.

435
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,263
Sheldon有话要跟您说
Sheldon would like to say something to you.

436
00:16:33,265 --> 00:16:34,331
我没话可说
No, I wouldn't.

437
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,632
进来嘛
Just get in here.

438
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:38,068
你们好
Hello.

439
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,536
去吧
Go ahead.

440
00:16:39,538 --> 00:16:41,104
奶奶
Meemaw, look,

441
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:43,073
很抱歉...
I'm sorry, but...

442
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:44,374
但是我得为
I have to defend

443
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:46,310
我的女朋友辩护
my girlfriend to you.

444
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,612
Sheldon 谢谢
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

445
00:16:48,614 --> 00:16:51,215
棒呆 你又要多愁善感了是不是
Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.

446
00:16:55,854 --> 00:16:59,456
我一直很尊敬您和爷爷
I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.

447
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,725
我… 我知道他是一个多么难搞的人
I... I know what a challenging man he could be,

448
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:05,062
但是我看到你一直陪在他身边 让他
but I saw you stand by him and-and make him

449
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:06,663
成为了一个更好的人
into a better person.

450
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:07,698
确实如此
I did.

451
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,799
这也完全是
Yeah, well, that is exactly

452
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:10,767
过去五年里我和这个小半成品
what I've been doing the last five years

453
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:13,003
一直在经历的事
with this little work in progress.

454
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:17,975
他从未让人失望 是不?
He never disappoints, does he?

455
00:17:19,144 --> 00:17:22,179
我想Sheldon是想说
I think what Sheldon means to say is

456
00:17:22,181 --> 00:17:24,381
我们俩一起成长了
we've both grown together.

457
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:25,449
对吗?
Isn't that right?

458
00:17:25,451 --> 00:17:26,850
嗯...
Well...

459
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:27,317
快说是
Say yes.

460
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,685
是
Yes.

461
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,087
好吧
Fine.

462
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:33,790
如果你感受如此强烈 我也不会妨碍你们的好事
If you feel so strongly, I won't stand in your way.

463
00:17:33,792 --> 00:17:35,025
太感谢了
Thank you.

464
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:36,126
所以如果他想
So if he wanted

465
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,328
把那个订婚戒指给我的话
to give me that engagement ring,

466
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,364
也能得到您的同意咯？
we would have your blessing?

467
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:42,366
我想是的
I suppose.

468
00:17:47,673 --> 00:17:49,239
女人 我才刚刚把我的童贞给你
I just gave you my virginity, woman.

469
00:17:49,241 --> 00:17:50,974
冷静点
Cool your jets.

470
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,591
如果你把故事改成
Yeah, see, if you just change the story

471
00:18:04,593 --> 00:18:06,727
我们这个星系毁灭了
to the destruction of our galaxy,

472
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:09,229
那么一个超级巨型的黑洞就会产生了
then a super massive black hole could work.

473
00:18:09,231 --> 00:18:10,797
很棒
This is great.

474
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,066
太感谢你了
Thank you so much.

475
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:14,968
我只需想出一种让所有人都死去
I just got to figure out a way for everyone

476
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,638
又不让小孩感到害怕的方式就好了
to die that isn't too scary for children.

477
00:18:19,275 --> 00:18:23,076
这就是粑粑麻麻相识的过程
And that's how Mommy and Daddy met.

478
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:26,847
嘿 你告诉Emily我俩的事了吗？
Hey, did you ever tell Emily about us?

479
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,315
我会的！
I will!
