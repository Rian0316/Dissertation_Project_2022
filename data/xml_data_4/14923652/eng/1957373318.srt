00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Oh.

357
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,080
Right. [chuckles]

358
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,600
Toothbrush.

359
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
- Okay.
- [both laugh]

360
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Oh.

361
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,280
- I think, then, I've got everything.
- Great. I'll meet you outside.

362
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,440
[Maureen] Okay.

363
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,880
[door opens]

364
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
- Oops.
- What?

365
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,880
- I left the keys inside.
- [gasps] Oh fuck!

366
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

367
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,640
Goat.

368
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,320
There she is.

369
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh!

370
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,400
- Hey.
- Hello, darling.

371
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,680
- Hey, Mum.
- [both chuckle]

372
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,200
- Do I have three eyes?
- No, no.

373
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,960
No, you just have two.

374
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:10,880
[sighs]

375
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,360
Feels like I've got three.

376
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,720
- [Otis] Yeah.
- Mmm.

377
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Oh, I've got something to tell you.

378
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,280
Very important.

379
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,640
I've been meaning to tell you
for a very long time.

380
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,480
Yeah?

381
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
[inhales]

382
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
I

383
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,200
am the king.

384
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
[inhales]

385
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,280
The king of what?

386
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,240
The King of Everything.

387
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,840
[laughs]

388
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,480
Isn't that the best news
you've ever heard?

389
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,000
- Yeah, that's pretty great.
- Mm.

390
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,040
I knew you'd think so.

391
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,280
- [Jean sighs]
- [chuckles]

392
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh my God.

393
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,361
- Why am I wearing this horrible dress?
- Mum. Mum, just... just rest.

394
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
- Just lie... just lie down.
- [gasps] Someone's taken my knickers.

395
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,080
- Has he taken my knickers?
- [Jakob] No.

396
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
- Um...
- Did he take them?

397
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,760
Darling, I think he took my knickers.

398
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,840
[whimsical music playing]

399
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
[music fades]

400
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,400
My mum thinks she's the king.

401
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,360
What?

402
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
She's high on anesthetic.

403
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,880
She told me she's the King of Everything.

404
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,160
[laughing]

405
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,640
[exhales]

406
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,040
- Oh, I'm really glad she's okay, man.
- Yeah.

407
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,080
[both chuckle]

408
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,240
You've been an amazing friend,
but you need to go talk to Adam now.

409
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,040
Oh God! [sighs]

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,800
I don't know what to say to him.

411
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
Just tell him how you feel.

412
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:56,360
...the energy required to completely remove
an electron from an atom of an element

413
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
to form an ion.

414
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,000
So, ionization energy. You're all to know
that formula for your exam on Monday.

415
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,840
If you look in your textbooks
on page 32, you will see...

416
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,800
[Erin] Over here!

417
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,440
You're supposed to be on the run.

418
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,920
[Erin] I know that.

419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,440
That's why I'm hiding.

420
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
You should come in the bush with me.

421
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,840
Mum, you need to disappear.

422
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,960
I had to give you something.

423
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,200
- What's this?
- I want you to go do that America thing.

424
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,216
- Where did you get it?
- It doesn't matter. I sold some shit.

425
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,880
- [scoffs]
- I want you to go.

426
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,920
It's too late anyway.

427
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
Supposed to leave tomorrow.
I haven't paid, so...

428
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Well, call 'em up and charm 'em.
Try not to sound so angry.

429
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,840
I can't.

430
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes, you can.

431
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Mum...

432
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm moving in with Anna.

433
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,160
I feel really guilty,
like I've left you behind.

434
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,400
No.

435
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,080
You never left me behind.

436
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,120
I left you behind.

437
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,320
I was too young and stupid to have kids.

438
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,840
I've let you down over and over again.

439
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,520
That's why I need you to take this money

440
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,440
and go to America.

441
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,160
Or

442
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,520
buy yourself something pretty
for your new room.

443
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,480
Now, I don't wanna hear any more about it.

444
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
[emotional music playing]

445
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,760
- [cries]
- [Erin] Oh.

446
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
[sniffles]

447
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,080
- [Erin] I gotta go.
- [patting Maeve's back]

448
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,480
[sniffles]

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,400
[phone chimes]

450
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,440
[sniffles]

451
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,760
So I thought about it a lot.

452
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,840
I just don't think I'm queer.

453
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,320
- I figured as much.
- [chuckles]

454
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,000
I thought you were all about
breaking out of boxes.

455
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,480
So what does it matter
if I'm queer or if I'm not?

456
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,880
Because I'm not a girl,
and I'm worried you still see me as one.

457
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
Yeah, maybe I do.

458
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,920
But I'm open, like, I'm...

459
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,440
willing to learn.

460
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,800
[Cal] Here's the thing.

461
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,400
I'm still figuring out
so much shit about myself.

462
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,040
I can't carry you too.

463
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,000
And I still wanna have fun when I can

464
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,360
because I feel so heavy all the time.
[chuckles]

465
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,240
So, what does this mean?

466
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,040
It means that we can still be friends.

467
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,520
[both chuckle]

468
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,560
I don't really have friends
that I've been with like that.

469
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,480
There's a first for everything.

470
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,840
I do really like you.

471
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
I really like you too.

472
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,680
I'm sorry that

473
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,000
this isn't gonna work out.

474
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,920
[announcement chimes]

to the common room, please?</i>

[Jackson chuckles]

<i>Could all sixth formers
please make their way to the common room?</i>

479
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,280
Oh, Mark! Hello.

480
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,040
I was wondering whether you
and I could have a conversation

481
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,240
about the head teacher position.

482
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,600
What do you want to know?

483
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,520
I would like to put myself forward
for the job.

484
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,120
I have worked at Moordale for seven years.

485
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,920
- I have a good understanding...
- Sorry, uh...

486
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,760
- Emily. Yeah.
- Emily. Emily.

487
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,000
We're not taking applications currently,
but thanks.

[whimsical music playing]

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,800
Can you sign your story?

490
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,880
[girl] Glenoxi's my hero.

491
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:02,880
No. No, no.

492
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
I'm the grown-up.

493
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,760
[mischievous music playing]

494
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,640

495
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh!

496
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,480
[gasps] It's open!

497
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,440
Go, Maureen! Go, Maureen!
Go, Maureen! Go, Maureen!

498
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,160
[gasps]

499
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Goat?

500
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,360
[Maureen] I think Goat might be a lesbian.

501
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,080
[Goat bleating]

502
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,720
[Mark] Following the coverage
of yesterday's events,

503
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,520
our investors have pulled
all of their funding from the school.

504
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,840
[students] What?

505
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:04,120
So we have no choice but to sell
Moordale Secondary to developers.

506
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,320
[students] What?

507
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,880
[Mark] Now, I have been sent
to tell you personally

508
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,280
because, as sixth formers, this decision
could have a dire effect on your futures.

509
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,480
You will need to find
educational alternatives

510
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,040
to complete your schooling
by the end of this term.

511
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,880
- [students groaning]
- [boy] This term?

512
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,200
Basically, you guys are fucked.

513
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,200
[students exclaiming]

514
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,480
Shit.

515
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,600
That backfired.

516
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,280
- What a waste of time.
- Hey.

517
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,240
Speaking up for what you believe in
is never a waste of time.

518
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
You did the right thing.

519
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,160
Thanks, miss.

520
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,440
I was not expecting that.

521
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
[Adam] <i>Yeah.</i>

522
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,520
Listen, I, uh...

523
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,240
was wondering if you'd read my poem.

524
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,560
I wanna give it to Eric,
but I think it's still shit.

525
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,080
Okay, I'll read it for you.

526
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,680
Um, they're selling the school.

527
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,800
What? When?

528
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,960
- Adam, I'm so sorry. I...
- Stop apologizing.

529
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Can we walk home together?

530
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,400
Yeah.

531
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,360
[pensive music playing]

532
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,280
I'll give you a hand.

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,440
Thanks. This woman bumped into me,
and she didn't even say sorry.

534
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,680
Oh, it's you.

Yeah, I heard.

Hey.

545
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Hey, are you following me?
Because you're starting to freak me out.

546
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,520
I... I wanted to say sorry.

547

[water stops]

548
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,720
- For what?
- For not speaking up.

549
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,440
That's okay.
You'll speak up when you're ready.

550
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Also, uh,

551
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
I need your help.

- Oh.

553
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,040
Maureen, thank you.

554
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,920
It means a lot.

555
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,760
She's out of surgery.

556
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,000
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Yeah.

557
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,440
I'll pop in when she's feeling stronger,

558
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,160
but if there's anything else I can do,
anything, just ask.

559
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,480

560
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,960

562
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
Hi, kid.

563
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
How long you been sitting here?

564
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,680
I think I did this, Dad.

565
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,000
What do you mean?

566
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,000
I think I made
all this bad stuff happen to Jean.

567
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,160
I said some really terrible things to her.
I had some really horrible thoughts.

568
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Jean is awake.

569
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,040
And she's fine.

570
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,600
- Okay.
- Okay?

571
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,080
And we all have
horrible thoughts sometimes.

572
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Doesn't mean bad things will happen.

573
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,080
Something bad did happen.

[kisses]

577
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,400
I'm pleased that you're happy with Jean
and that you're moving on.

578
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,880
But I'm also really worried
you'll like your new family more than me

579
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,520
because I remind you of the pain.

580
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,680
You remind me of joy.

581
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,480
[emotional music playing]

582
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,360
Only joy.

00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Okay?

585
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Okay.

586
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,040
[Adam] I'm thinking that maybe
we could pretend it didn't happen.

587
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,240
But it did happen.

588
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
I messed up.

589
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Badly.

590
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,240
I... I can be okay with it.
It was a stupid kiss.

591
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,240
It didn't mean anything. I can get over...

592
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,760
I don't think it was just
a stupid kiss, Adam.

593
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Did you...

594
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,880
did you sleep with this guy? Is that...

595
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,680
No. That's not what I mean.

596
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,440
We only kissed, but it wasn't stupid.

597
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,120
It was something.

598
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,440
You don't feel bad?

599
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,480
Yes, I feel bad.

600
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,160
I feel bad I hurt you.

601
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,040
But you wouldn't take it back?

602
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,960
No, I don't think I would.

603
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,880
- It felt easy with him.
- Mm.

604
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,880
[sniffles] And it feels hard with me.

605
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,160
I just feel like I'm... I'm ready to fly,

606
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,880
and you're just learning to walk.

607
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,960
And I've worked really hard
to find myself,

608
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,600
and I'm beginning to lose who I am.

609
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,000
We're gonna break up, aren't we?

610
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,200
- I think we have to.
- Yeah.

611
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,920
It's not your fault. [splutters]

612
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,320
We're just going in different directions.

you were being so smart yesterday.

You know, I'm not much older than you,

but my generation knew
how to conduct themselves.

We knew what was important.

652

The issues we talked about
have always been there.

653
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,040

safe enough to raise them.

How are you a failure?

It doesn't do

669
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,080
the... the one thing it's supposed to do.

[Hope] But you can't have everything,
I suppose.

673
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
And dwelling on it makes me weak.

saying you feel disappointed by something
you want but maybe can't have

677
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
makes you honest.

678
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,840
And admitting your vulnerabilities
makes you courageous.

679
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
[Hope] Yeah.

00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,160
three,

892
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,240
two, one!

893
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,160
[crowd groans]

894
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,520
Maybe it'll happen next time.

895
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,920
Do you wanna stay a bit longer?

896
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,920
No, it's okay.

897
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,840
[Ola gasps] Lily, look!

898
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,760
- [crowd exclaims]
- [laughs]

899
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,800
- [Aimee] Maeve?
- Yeah?

900
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,160
What the hell is this?

901
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,160
My mum gave it to me
for the trip to America.

902
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,400
They booked me on a flight tomorrow,
but I'm not going.

903
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,160
Uh, why?

904
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:52,600
Because things are good with Otis.
I don't wanna mess it up again, so...

905
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:55,520
Oh my God. Maeve Wiley, come here now.

906
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,760
- Sit down.
- [chuckles]

907
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,600
- I'm talking to you as your second mother.
- Mm-hmm.

908
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,680
If you decide to not go to America

909
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,600
and make
your disgustingly big brain even bigger,

910
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,480
I'm gonna have to end our friendship.

911
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,880
A bit harsh.

912
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,120
If I was gonna miss out on an opportunity
for a boy, what would you tell me?

913
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,240
Probably to screw your head back on.

914
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,200
Exactly.

915
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,400
[both chuckle]

916
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,000
Don't forget about me.

917
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,320
[Maeve] Impossible.

918
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,760
[breathes deeply]

919
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:35,920
[Aimee] Right.

920
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,040
We better get you packed, then. Again.

921
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,200
[chuckles]

922
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,400
[sighs]

923
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,520
- [Otis] So no more Moordale.
- [Eric] Mm.

924
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,720
[Otis] What are we gonna do?

925
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:49,760
Well, as long as we've got each other,

926
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,360
we'll be all right.

927
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,280
[Maeve] Otis?

928
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:00,840
[Otis chuckles]

929
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,680
[Eric] Come one, come on. Come on!

930
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,240
[Otis] Hey.

931
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,680
What are you doing here?

932
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,520
Mm, um...

933
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,480
[breathes deeply]

934
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,120
Okay, um... [clears throat]

935
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,280
I've changed my mind.

936
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,520
About what?

937
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
America.

938
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,320
I found the money, so I'm going.

939
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
Right.

940
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:32,920
When?

941
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,760
Now.

942
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,240
Wow.

943
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,480
- Yeah.
- Oh.

944
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,680
You know you don't need my help
for the clinic, right? It's your gift.

945
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah, and what about us?

946
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,920
[emotional music playing]

947
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,600
We'll see where we're at when I'm back.

948
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,040
[breathes deeply]

949
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Proud of you.

950
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,000
- I mean it.
- [chuckles]

951
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,600
- America?
- Yeah.

952
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:14,240
So this is goodbye.

953
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
No.

954
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,080
No.

955
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,880
It's see you soon.

956
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
[Otis chuckles]

957
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,400
[Otis sniffles]

958
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,120
Okay, cool. Wish me luck.

959
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,200
Yeah.

960
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,880
Bye, Eric.

961
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
Bye, Maeve.
