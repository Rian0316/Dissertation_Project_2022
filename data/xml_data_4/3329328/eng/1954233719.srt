what you're talking about.

try to get you answers.

but she certainly wants
us to, doesn't she?

193
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:53,298
Let me guess. There's
something of benefit

194
00:12:53,299 --> 00:12:54,999
for you in all of this, isn't there?

away into nothingness.

00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:55,645
As much as I would hate to throw you

355
00:21:55,646 --> 00:21:57,146
over my shoulder and drag you

356
00:21:57,147 --> 00:21:58,881
kicking and screaming to the compound,

357
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:02,552
we both know I will
for the sake of my child.

358
00:22:02,553 --> 00:22:04,187
One bad dream,
and suddenly you want to be

359
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,688
a responsible daddy.

360
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:10,526
Let me put this in perspective.

361
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,295
My father lived to torment me.

362
00:22:13,297 --> 00:22:16,299
It is not my intention to become him.

363
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,535
This cycle of misery
ends with my child.

364
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:20,903
[Chuckles softly]

365
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:24,140
You forgot one thing in your
attempt to plead your case.

366
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,442
She's not your child.
She's ours.

367
00:22:29,412 --> 00:22:31,547
Very heartfelt, Niklaus.

368
00:22:31,548 --> 00:22:34,083
I bloody hate funerals.

369
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:36,552
Cami...
[Clears throat]

370
00:22:36,553 --> 00:22:38,120
Hayley, hi.

371
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,055
Hi. I know you don't know me.

372
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:45,027
I just wanted to say that I...
I'm sorry about your Uncle.

373
00:22:45,028 --> 00:22:47,496
He was really good to people like me

374
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:50,799
during the storm, and I
really appreciated that.

375
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,135
Thank you.

376
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:54,999
You want something, don't you?

377
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,741
I'm sorry about the timing.

378
00:22:58,742 --> 00:23:02,111
I was just wondering
if before he died,

379
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:04,745
he said anything weird
about Francesca Correa.

380
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:06,915
I think that she may
have been involved

381
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,784
in an attack on the bayou.

382
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:10,419
If you hear anything...

383
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,688
Look, Hayley, I'm tr

384
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,723
mostly failing...
To stay out of all this stuff,

385
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:16,558
but she's a real bitch.

386
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,726
So, yeah, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

387
00:23:18,728 --> 00:23:21,563
Thanks. Um, again, sorry
about your Uncle.

388
00:23:21,564 --> 00:23:22,997
Me, too.

389
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,066
[Coughing]

390
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:38,979
Klaus!

391
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,250
Hayley!

392
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,290
Genevieve: I can help.

393
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,926
Don't you touch her.

394
00:23:50,927 --> 00:23:52,493
Let her be, Elijah.
She was a nurse.

395
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:53,795
There's a spell I can do.

396
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:55,429
Klaus, get chamomile from the pantry.

397
00:23:56,498 --> 00:23:57,965
Genevieve: She's trembling.

398
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,233
Your jacket, Elijah.

399
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:01,302
She's not breathing.

400
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:05,639
[Muffled] I can hear the baby's
heartbeat, but not hers.

401
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,608
[Gasping]

402
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:21,855
Who are you?

403
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,728
I suppose...

404
00:24:26,729 --> 00:24:28,662
I'm family.

405
00:24:35,243 --> 00:24:36,711
In the beginning was the word.

406
00:24:36,712 --> 00:24:38,179
And the word was with God.

407
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,015
He was with God in the beginning.

408
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:42,650
In him was life.

409
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:46,687
And that life was
the light of all mankind.

410
00:24:46,688 --> 00:24:50,491
The light shines in the darkness.

411
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:54,093
And the darkness has not overcome it.

412
00:25:01,936 --> 00:25:03,102
Cami...

413
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,341
Sean didn't have a funeral.

414
00:25:07,342 --> 00:25:08,742
Our parents wanted
nothing to do with him,

415
00:25:08,743 --> 00:25:10,077
so the city had him buried out here

416
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:12,645
with the criminals
and the John does...

417
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:14,480
The great unloved.

418
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,751
You said you checked my family's tomb,

419
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:19,186
but I've been thinking.

420
00:25:19,187 --> 00:25:20,621
All this time, I wondered why Kieran

421
00:25:20,622 --> 00:25:21,722
didn't have Sean interred,

422
00:25:21,723 --> 00:25:23,356
where he belonged, with the family.

423
00:25:23,358 --> 00:25:25,726
But then I realized, what if he saw

424
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:28,162
an opportunity to hide something

425
00:25:28,163 --> 00:25:30,731
he didn't want anyone else to find?

426
00:25:30,732 --> 00:25:33,299
Cami, we can do this another time.

427
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:35,968
Bad timing is the theme of the day.

428
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,306
I'm going to need a sledgehammer.

429
00:25:43,143 --> 00:25:45,344
Coeur blesse, battre avec mwen...

430
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,150
Come on.

431
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,223
Elijah: She's still not breathing.

432
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:58,257
It's not working.

433
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:04,763
I assume my reputation precedes me.

434
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,566
This is a nightmare.
I'm dreaming.

435
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:09,202
On the contrary, my darling.

436
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:12,972
This is very real.

437
00:26:12,974 --> 00:26:15,441
Welcome to my hell.

438
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,944
Stuck in an eternity of watching over

439
00:26:17,945 --> 00:26:21,848
that hideous creature
my children call brother.

440
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,316
You're dead.

441
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:24,984
How can I be here?

442
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,519
Oh, my God.

443
00:26:27,521 --> 00:26:30,990
No! No! The baby!

444
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:32,425
The baby?
Aah!

445
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:34,126
That kid never had a chance!

446
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:36,830
And as if your bloodline
isn't filth enough,

447
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:39,699
you poison it by merging
it with Klaus'?

448
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,001
[Chuckling]

449
00:26:42,002 --> 00:26:46,372
The deathless vermin
fancying himself a daddy.

450
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:47,473
[Screaming]

451
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:48,740
Aah!

452
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,246
She's not dead.
I'm not dead.

453
00:26:53,247 --> 00:26:56,015
If I was dead, you wouldn't
be trying to kill me.

454
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,184
[Chanting continues]

455
00:26:58,185 --> 00:26:59,485
I'm taking her to a real doctor.

456
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:02,321
If you move her from here,
my spell will break.

457
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:04,022
There won't be enough time
to get her to a hospital.

458
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,992
Will the baby survive
if delivered now?

459
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,160
I'll rip it out of her myself.

460
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:09,094
Hayley will bleed to death.

461
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:12,164
I won't lose that baby.

462
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,533
I won't lose either of them.

463
00:27:13,534 --> 00:27:14,900
[Genevieve's chanting resumes]

464
00:27:17,103 --> 00:27:19,004
[Distorted chants]

465
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:21,506
I know what to do.

466
00:27:21,508 --> 00:27:23,209
Get my bag...
The gris-gris pouch.

467
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,376
Now!

468
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:26,812
You're dead, Mikael.

469
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,214
Your son already beat you.

470
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:31,250
He is not my son!

471
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:35,220
He's a scourge, a walking
symbol of weakness.

472
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:43,394
There is no saving that atrocity
festering in your womb.

473
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:46,064
Klaus will destroy it
one way or another.

474
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:49,901
Better he dies now
and you along with it.

475
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:03,282
Aah!

476
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,684
My daughter has an
advantage Klaus never had.

477
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,888
She will never, ever know you.

478
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:11,756
[Gasping]

479
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:13,091
Hayley.

480
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,696
You're all right, love.
You're all right.

481
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:21,299
I saw him, and he tried to kill me.

482
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,603
I saw Mikael.

483
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,828
[Knock knock]

484
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,299
You've proved quite
resilient, little wolf.

485
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,934
Fighters, both of you.

486
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:54,072
I guess we've had to be,
especially lately.

487
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,511
I've decided that I'm
going to move back in.

488
00:28:59,513 --> 00:29:01,913
Well, I'm relieved to hear it.

489
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:06,651
But no mouth-breathing bodyguards,
no telling me what to do.

490
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:10,822
All I ask is that
the child is kept safe.

491
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,592
And what about me?

492
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:14,127
What happens after she's born?

493
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,496
If you try to take her
away from me, I...

494
00:29:16,497 --> 00:29:18,630
Come with me, hmm?

495
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:24,870
Please. I want to show you something.

496
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:46,959
Believe it or not, Hayley,

497
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,727
I would actually like you to be here.

498
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,200
Our daughter should be
raised by her parents

499
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:56,769
in her family home.

500
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,639
You, me, Elijah, and the miracle
baby all under one roof.

501
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,907
Sounds like a bad reality show.

502
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:04,342
[Chuckles]

503
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,013
You said you saw my father.

504
00:30:09,015 --> 00:30:12,884
Why do you call him that?
He's not your real dad.

505
00:30:12,886 --> 00:30:16,054
He's done damage
only a father could do.

506
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:22,427
What did he say to you?

507
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,902
Nothing true.

508
00:30:56,628 --> 00:30:58,062
[Music playing]

509
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:09,507
Hayley and the baby are fine.

510
00:31:09,508 --> 00:31:11,042
I'd take her to a doctor when she's

511
00:31:11,043 --> 00:31:14,445
gotten some rest, if you want,
but she's in the clear.

512
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:20,984
I'll see myself out.

513
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,054
Genevieve...

514
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:32,062
Thank you for your help.

515
00:31:33,932 --> 00:31:35,232
You're welcome.

516
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:38,268
You tore my sister from my family.

517
00:31:40,905 --> 00:31:43,240
I cannot forgive that.

518
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:46,945
However, I may be inclined to
show a degree more of kindness

519
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,948
if you were to help me
with a slight issue.

520
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:52,116
Anything.

521
00:31:52,117 --> 00:31:53,651
When the baby arrives,

522
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:55,385
Hayley will once again
transform with a full moon.

523
00:31:55,387 --> 00:31:57,788
Now, I would like
to create for her a gift,

524
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:02,492
a ring of empowerment, something
to control this curse.

525
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:04,027
What kind of spell would...

526
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,963
A spell of my mother's,

527
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:08,266
from her grimoire,

528
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,233
which, as I understand,

529
00:32:10,235 --> 00:32:13,703
you have been rather eager to obtain.

530
00:32:27,752 --> 00:32:29,719
Someone must have gotten to it.

531
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,563
I don't think so.

532
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,940
My brother taught me
this code 15 years ago.

533
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:51,208
I never knew how he learned it.

534
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:52,977
You can tell me what that says?

535
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,511
I can...

536
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:57,147
But I won't.
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:58,315
Cami, this is too...

538
00:32:58,316 --> 00:33:00,283
Dangerous. Yeah.
I got it.

539
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:03,152
But if Kieran taught Sean this...

540
00:33:04,388 --> 00:33:07,557
My brother was meant to be
brought into it all along.

541
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,961
That makes it my responsibility now,

542
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,662
whether I like it or not.

543
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,301
What the hell did you do to Hayley?

544
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:20,204
I was trying to do what
the ancestors asked.

545
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,004
That baby is part witch.

546
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:24,341
The ancestors want her
consecrated to the earth

547
00:33:24,342 --> 00:33:26,176
so her magic can fuel our community.

548
00:33:26,177 --> 00:33:29,346
She has to be born first
before she can die.

549
00:33:29,347 --> 00:33:30,947
Leave.

550
00:33:30,949 --> 00:33:32,581
I don't want to look at you.

551
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,225
Allumez le feu dans cette femme...

552
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,035
Misericorde.
Don't make me do this.

553
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,837
[Sobbing] She's a baby.

554
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:58,141
Don't make me a monster.

555
00:33:58,142 --> 00:34:00,609
Please.

556
00:34:11,221 --> 00:34:12,654
No.

557
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:15,458
[Screaming]

558
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:19,394
Uh! Aah...

559
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,302
N... no.

560
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:28,371
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

561
00:34:28,372 --> 00:34:31,206
I'm sorry. I'll do it.

562
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,408
I'll do whatever you want!

563
00:34:51,688 --> 00:34:54,718
Hayley has agreed to
return home to us...

564
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,327
Of her own freewill.

565
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:11,541
When Mikael is truly gone,

566
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,411
do you think then I'll find peace?

567
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,078
I certainly hope so.

568
00:35:18,348 --> 00:35:21,984
Although it's not only our
father that haunts you, Niklaus.

569
00:35:24,187 --> 00:35:27,022
You might want to make
peace with the living.

570
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:33,196
Marcel: I demand to know
why their freedom

571
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,663
has not been granted.

572
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:37,533
All necessary authorities
have ruled in their favor.

573
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:40,202
You think I don't remember you, boy?

574
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:44,172
Have they turned you
into one of them yet?

575
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:46,375
[Chuckling]

576
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:50,412
I thought not.

577
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,281
[Screaming]

578
00:35:54,751 --> 00:35:56,863
[Woman groans]

579
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,423
[Gunshots]

580
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,590
Ugh!

581
00:36:15,104 --> 00:36:16,973
Here. Let me heal you.

582
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,206
No.

583
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:22,944
You've always said we'd
choose our family.

584
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:25,914
So what am I to you, Klaus?

585
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:30,385
You made me a promise when
you daggered your sister.

586
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:33,088
It's finally time to make a choice.

587
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,424
Turn me now...

588
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,126
Or let me die.

589
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:41,597
You do not know what you ask of me.

590
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,400
Becoming like me...

591
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:48,504
It would Rob you of all
that makes you good.

592
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:50,839
I know what you are...

593
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Who you are.

594
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,078
This is what I want.

595
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:01,416
Please.

596
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:08,923
[Labored breathing]

597
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:21,035
[Crack]

598
00:37:35,851 --> 00:37:38,553
Your furlough ends
when the clock strikes.

599
00:37:38,554 --> 00:37:40,855
I'm aware. Don't worry.

600
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:43,424
I intend to be far away
from here by then.

601
00:37:43,426 --> 00:37:46,761
But just because I'm across the river

602
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:49,129
doesn't mean I'm out of the game.

603
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:51,599
A full moon's coming.

604
00:37:51,601 --> 00:37:54,536
I know you're up to
something with the wolves.

605
00:37:54,537 --> 00:37:57,505
And I've been racking my brain,
trying to figure out what.

606
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:01,875
And any way I do the math, it
ends with me and my guys dead.

607
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:06,780
Or maybe we're supposed
to fall in line,

608
00:38:06,782 --> 00:38:09,718
pledge our allegiance
to you all over again.

609
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:14,155
So if we get bitten, you
might deign to cure us.

610
00:38:14,156 --> 00:38:16,790
Is that what you're after?

611
00:38:16,792 --> 00:38:18,692
Because it's not gonna happen.

612
00:38:18,694 --> 00:38:22,831
Well, that will be your
choice, just as you chose

613
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:24,898
to bring my father to town...

614
00:38:26,134 --> 00:38:29,671
You, who knows better than
anyone the specific agony

615
00:38:29,672 --> 00:38:31,371
of a father's hatred.

616
00:38:31,373 --> 00:38:32,573
Klaus...

617
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:34,242
I spent decades trying to make up

618
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:36,510
for what your father did.

619
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:39,913
How did I fail?

620
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:44,785
Maybe the scars just ran too deep.

621
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,360
Good night, Marcellus.

622
00:38:55,796 --> 00:38:58,031
You didn't fail me.

623
00:38:59,133 --> 00:39:01,001
You raised me.

624
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:05,405
You taught me everything that I know.

625
00:39:05,407 --> 00:39:08,208
You taught me that I
can't afford to be weak,

626
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,077
not when my enemies are stronger.

627
00:39:10,078 --> 00:39:12,613
So whatever it is you got
coming with the wolves,

628
00:39:12,614 --> 00:39:15,583
just know that I'm gonna
fight for my guys.

629
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:17,084
I'm gonna fight for my city.

630
00:39:17,085 --> 00:39:19,486
And I will fight until I am dead.

631
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:25,493
I would expect nothing less.

632
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,760
[Music playing]

633
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:55,088
If I died and someone threw a
party, I would be so pissed.

634
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,534
You almost did.

635
00:40:11,772 --> 00:40:14,241
In a thousand years,
I can't recall a time

636
00:40:14,242 --> 00:40:18,344
I've felt so frightened.

637
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:30,823
Elijah...

638
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:14,233
[Chimes ringing]

639
00:41:20,506 --> 00:41:22,908
Tim, is that you?

640
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,385
Who are you?

641
00:41:32,386 --> 00:41:35,020
Your friend Timothy
has moved on, Davina.

642
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:40,093
I'm truly sorry for
what my son did to him.

643
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:42,161
You're Klaus' father.

644
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:45,131
And I'm the only one who can
rid you of him forever.

645
00:41:45,132 --> 00:41:46,899
[Speech echoing]

646
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,535
But first, my little witch...

647
00:41:49,536 --> 00:41:51,303
I need you.

648
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:53,705
What can I do?

649
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:57,974
You can bring me back to life.

650
00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:04,203
