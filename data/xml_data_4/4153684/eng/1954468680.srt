00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:30,956
I know. I blame her.

179
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,526
She couldn't find
a man till late in life.

180
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:35,561
There go the pedicures.

181
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:38,931
There go my sandals.

182
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:43,602
As much as I love
watching <i>Will and Grace,</i>

183
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:45,137
this guy's not for sale.

184
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,072
I'm sending him back
to my mother's place,

185
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,208
which, according
to the Rhode Island Parole Office,

186
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,279
is a cardboard shanty town
outside of big lots.

187
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,914
Well, here's my card.

188
00:08:55,916 --> 00:09:00,385
And let's face it, you look
like you could use $500.

189
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:05,557
So bitchy. Love him!

190
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:10,562
I was just offered $500 for T-Rux

191
00:09:10,564 --> 00:09:13,498
from Baby Anderson Cooper.

192
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:16,835
He has cards?

193
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:18,303
I'm jealous of a nine-year-old?

194
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:19,972
That's where I'm at?

195
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:22,607
Hey, as much as I would like that $500,

196
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,609
my mother doesn't get to think this bear

197
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,945
gets to make up for my childhood.

198
00:09:26,947 --> 00:09:28,580
She doesn't get off that easy.

199
00:09:28,582 --> 00:09:31,850
Trust me, we shared a pullout couch
for nine months.

200
00:09:31,852 --> 00:09:33,919
Girls, can I see you over here?

201
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:36,221
I can't believe we have
to talk to the fish again.

202
00:09:36,223 --> 00:09:39,991
I can't believe Max hasn't
put Han in the tank yet.

203
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:43,895
Max, Caroline, every night from now on,

204
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,698
I need you to move the skimmer
along the top of the water

205
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,366
and take out the floating matter.

206
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:52,137
Han, you know
I'm off diner poop patrol for life

207
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:55,573
after I had to clean
the booth where the senior left...

208
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,510
Well, we'll just call it an elderberry.

209
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,083
Well, Caroline, Max said no,
so you have to do it.

210
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:07,452
Han, you're kind of a baller
around your fish.

211
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:08,887
All right, I'm gonna do this fast.

212
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,555
Get in and get out.

213
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:12,457
Same thing I do
when that bird is in our shower.

214
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,626
[Bell dings] Pick up, Max.

215
00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:17,295
Look, I'm calling to tell
you I met somebody else

216
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,997
so I'm breaking up with you.

217
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:22,000
Now put your mother on.
I'm breaking up with her too.

218
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,272
I can't believe this.

219
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:31,843
I'm a Cabana Boy for fish.

220
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:34,078
I guess now I can add
"fish poop remover"

221
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,283
to my resume
next to "supreme court intern".

222
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:42,987
I feel like there was
a fish in that last one.

223
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:44,555
Yup.

224
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:46,657
Oh, no, it's the expensive one!

225
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:49,393
That's so me.

226
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:51,095
I really didn't expect to see
you digging through garbage

227
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,597
till you were 30.

228
00:10:53,599 --> 00:10:56,467
Oh! Ah! Ugh! It's still alive!

229
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:58,402
I need to keep her wet.

230
00:10:58,404 --> 00:11:01,439
Oh, covered in tuna, that's
gotta be traumatic for it.

231
00:11:06,845 --> 00:11:09,713
I feel like it went down the drain.

232
00:11:09,715 --> 00:11:12,149
It was an accident. I swear.

233
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,685
I love fish. I would never hurt one.

234
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,353
Unless you count eating
sushi, 'cause then I'm like

235
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,955
Jack the Ripper.

236
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:20,190
Caroline, are things going swimmingly?

237
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:22,126
Jack, he's talking to you.

238
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:24,562
Uh, oh, yeah. Swimmingly.

239
00:11:24,564 --> 00:11:26,096
Especially the blue one.

240
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,898
He went in his little house.

241
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,033
He doesn't like to use the restroom

242
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,035
in front of his friends.

243
00:11:31,037 --> 00:11:33,537
Yeah, we're a lot alike.

244
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,778
Thank you so much for
seeing us so quickly.

245
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,013
Sure, you guys can just wait in here.

246
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:46,250
Elliot's finishing up with his pilates.

247
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:48,018
Do yourselves a favor.

248
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,054
Tell him his core looks tight.

249
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,561
Max, I'm so sorry
you have to sell T-Rux

250
00:11:57,563 --> 00:12:00,364
for the fish money because of me.

251
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:03,800
Talked to the fist,
because the face is pissed.

252
00:12:03,802 --> 00:12:05,235
I'm getting attitude from a bear?

253
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:08,238
That's where I'm at?

254
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,640
I can't believe all this
stuff he has from the '90s.

255
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:14,911
I can't believe he has to
have a party to come out.

256
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,913
That kid came out, out.

257
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:21,017
His umbilical cord is a Gucci belt.

258
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,553
Oh! These toys!

259
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:25,889
This is like looking
back at my childhood

260
00:12:25,891 --> 00:12:29,125
but, you know, a time before
rainbows became political.

261
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,160
[Gasps]

262
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:31,228
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

263
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,129
Oh, my God.

264
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,898
A my size Barbie!

265
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,232
I had ten of these.

266
00:12:36,234 --> 00:12:38,034
Not to play with, they
were used as decoys

267
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:40,203
in case of a hostage situation.

268
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:44,741
And now your whole life's
a hostage situation.

269
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,076
Sorry I'm late.

270
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:47,844
My trainer, Gary, and I got derailed

271
00:12:47,846 --> 00:12:49,979
talking about
<i>The Real Housewives of Orange County.</i>

272
00:12:49,981 --> 00:12:51,481
Your core looks really good.

273
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:53,783
I know, honey.

274
00:12:53,785 --> 00:12:58,621
Now while I get my check book,
say hello to the Olsens.

275
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:00,290
You got a lot of toys.

276
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:04,027
When I was a girl your age,
I only had this.

277
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,561
I don't suppose I could
play with my size Barbie

278
00:13:05,563 --> 00:13:07,630
for a second.

279
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:10,133
I feel like that's a "No, bitch".

280
00:13:10,135 --> 00:13:12,635
I'm not... I'm not just
talking about the toys.

281
00:13:12,637 --> 00:13:14,837
You got a pretty sweet set-up.

282
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:17,273
That nice lady out there,
giving you everything you want,

283
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:18,708
taking care of you.

284
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,145
She's just a mom. Everyone has one.

285
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:27,216
Not really. Some people
just have bad ass bears.

286
00:13:27,218 --> 00:13:29,285
Max, are you sure about this?

287
00:13:29,287 --> 00:13:31,554
This is the only thing you
have from your childhood.

288
00:13:31,556 --> 00:13:33,322
Not true, I have a dent in my skull

289
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:36,559
from a ball-peen hammer.

290
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,494
The last time I change the channel

291
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,497
during <i>Three's Company.</i>

292
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:44,066
Can we fast forward this
to me having the bear

293
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,768
and you two leaving?

294
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,470
Okay, just take it, it doesn't matter.

295
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,338
No, Max. It does matter.

296
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,339
We're not selling this.

297
00:13:50,341 --> 00:13:52,041
He has enough toys.

298
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,710
I mean, all I wanted to do
was touch the life-size Barbie.

299
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,378
Okay, I see what's happening.

300
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,714
I've been down this road
with the Beanie Babies.

301
00:13:58,716 --> 00:13:59,982
I'll give you 600 for the bear.

302
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:01,150
Sold.

303
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:02,084
No, Max! That's your childhood.

304
00:14:02,086 --> 00:14:03,219
- 700.
- Sold!

305
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,520
No, Max!

306
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:07,423
Caroline, my childhood
is not worth $700.

307
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:09,325
The most my mother ever
got for me was 40 bucks

308
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:11,093
and a big gulp.

309
00:14:11,095 --> 00:14:13,896
But that's "little you" in there, Max.

310
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,431
And she's priceless.

311
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,699
And she's about to erased and taped over

312
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:18,734
by the soundtrack from <i>Frozen.</i>

313
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:20,002
<i>Frozen?</i>

314
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:23,906
Who am I? Me, a year ago?

315
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:25,941
No. Can't have her.

316
00:14:25,943 --> 00:14:28,210
Well, what are we gonna do
now about the other child?

317
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:29,745
The one in the diner?

318
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,613
Well, I guess he's just
gonna have to grow up.

319
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,215
Grow up? You think if
he had that ability,

320
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:37,386
he wouldn't have used it yet?

321
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:39,755
So what, no bear?

322
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:41,790
Oh, please! You'll have
a bear in your life.

323
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,992
Trust me.

324
00:14:53,188 --> 00:14:54,555
All right, Max.

325
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:55,723
You're gonna help me tell him, right?

326
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:57,425
You like giving him bad news.

327
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,594
No, I like giving him bad
news about how he's short

328
00:14:59,596 --> 00:15:00,595
and has a big head.

329
00:15:00,597 --> 00:15:02,864
You know, fun bad news.

330
00:15:02,866 --> 00:15:04,432
Exciting news!

331
00:15:04,434 --> 00:15:06,334
I got the fishies a new house!

332
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:10,071
I got it cheap. It was a foreclosure.

333
00:15:10,073 --> 00:15:12,306
Uh, Han, can we talk to you over there

334
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:14,342
in the booth, the far booth?

335
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,711
Can it wait? I want
to put in the new condo

336
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:20,081
so Max will stop calling me a slum lord.

337
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:21,883
Oh, that can wait, I mean, those fish

338
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,384
aren't going anywhere.

339
00:15:23,386 --> 00:15:24,819
Except for the blue one,
who's definitely playing

340
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,121
some kind of twisted
game of hide and seek.

341
00:15:27,123 --> 00:15:28,789
Oh, yeah, he loves that little house.

342
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,325
He's going to love this one even more.

343
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,927
Max, can you join me?

344
00:15:32,929 --> 00:15:37,632
I'm pretty busy waiting
on tables right now.

345
00:15:37,634 --> 00:15:38,999
Okay, what's going on?

346
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:42,570
Max has never waited
on a table in her life.

347
00:15:42,572 --> 00:15:44,238
Max, I need you over here.

348
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
I'm just putting down
this grilled cheese

349
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:48,209
'cause I don't want it to get cold.

350
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:51,245
Now I'm freaking out!

351
00:15:51,247 --> 00:15:52,913
Max, don't do this to me.

352
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:55,282
I know where the bodies
are buried, literally.

353
00:15:55,284 --> 00:15:58,285
I move them every six months.

354
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,587
Well, what is it?

355
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,756
Han, sometimes in life, things happen

356
00:16:02,758 --> 00:16:04,792
that you don't want to happen.

357
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:07,127
Yes.

358
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,729
And even though it's hard, you know,

359
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,831
you just have to face up to it.

360
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,300
I suppose.

361
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:17,237
Oh, dear God, this is rough.

362
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,406
And, well...

363
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:21,108
Han, I don't wanna
have to tell you this,

364
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,710
I know this is the last
thing you ever want to hear...

365
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:25,012
Oh, just say it!

366
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:30,284
The tampon machine is broken again.

367
00:16:30,286 --> 00:16:34,354
Later, I'll get my blindfold and fix it.

368
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:35,989
Word of advice?

369
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,357
When you do finally kill me,

370
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:39,893
you gotta work on your
game face for the cops.

371
00:16:39,895 --> 00:16:41,161
Max, please.

372
00:16:41,163 --> 00:16:42,863
I can't tell han I murdered his fish.

373
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:43,897
I can't.

374
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,165
Well, I can't tell him either.

375
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,933
Oh, hell, I'll tell him.

376
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:52,739
I'm a black man, everyone
already assumes I did it.

377
00:16:52,741 --> 00:16:54,474
Thank you. Thank you so much.

378
00:16:54,476 --> 00:16:57,244
It's just a fish. He'll be fine.

379
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:59,012
I've decided I'll
give Blue the new house

380
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,648
at its birthday party later.

381
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,851
It's the damn fish's birthday?

382
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:07,053
I'm out.

383
00:17:07,922 --> 00:17:10,223
And you're all invited.

384
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:11,858
Blue's two years old today.

385
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,761
They don't usually live that long.

386
00:17:14,763 --> 00:17:17,464
No, they do not.

387
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:19,899
That's it, we can't tell him.

388
00:17:19,901 --> 00:17:21,601
Even at Han's age, which I am guessing

389
00:17:21,603 --> 00:17:26,539
is somewhere between 14 and 53,

390
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,775
some kids just aren't ready to grow up.

391
00:17:28,777 --> 00:17:30,076
What are we gonna do?

392
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,045
We're gonna run out and buy a new one.

393
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:33,213
Where are we gonna get the money?

394
00:17:33,215 --> 00:17:36,216
Oleg, you know how two years ago

395
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:38,284
you offered me $1,000 for a back rub?

396
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:39,552
Of course.

397
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:43,189
Caroline will do it for $500.

398
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:45,725
Deal. One last hurrah.

399
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,293
Over the clothes, above the waist,

400
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:49,896
and I don't know why, but
you have to wear a condom.

401
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:59,539
Yes, Father Dominic Rosello, please.

402
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,874
Oh, he's celebrating mass?

403
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:05,645
Oh yeah, could you just tell
him that Sophie Kachinski

404
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,481
is converting to monogamy?

405
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:14,520
And uh, she won't be
kneeling at his altar anymore.

406
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:19,158
Oh, yeah, yeah, he'll understand.

407
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,093
Where's Han and does he know?

408
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,397
No, but I can't keep
pretending I see that fish.

409
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:26,432
I'm a pot-head with
a touch of glaucoma.

410
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,834
I'm seeing stuff that's not there.

411
00:18:28,836 --> 00:18:30,336
Not seeing stuff that's there...

412
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,905
It's confusing.

413
00:18:32,907 --> 00:18:34,306
Okay. Come on, come on.

414
00:18:34,308 --> 00:18:36,075
Put it in, put it in, put it in.

415
00:18:36,077 --> 00:18:38,043
I have a whole new respect for every guy

416
00:18:38,045 --> 00:18:40,679
that's ever gone out with you.

417
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:42,915
Happy birthday, Blue!

418
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:48,087
(Han) Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, Blue.

419
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:49,154
Where's Blue?

420
00:18:49,156 --> 00:18:50,456
I haven't seen her all day.

421
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,490
I just saw it.

422
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:54,059
Yeah, it was definitely there.

423
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,594
You're not gonna give Blue that cupcake

424
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,396
without a photo-op, are you?
Where's your iPad?

425
00:18:57,398 --> 00:19:00,666
I just saw it. Yeah,
it was definitely there.

426
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:02,000
Yeah, Han, go!

427
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:04,002
You need a pic so you
can post it on Facebook

428
00:19:04,004 --> 00:19:05,304
or Fishbook or whatever.

429
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:06,972
Good idea. Here, hold this.

430
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,976
Hey, Caroline, you look less flat.

431
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:13,745
You finally get that
boob job you needed?

432
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,350
I feel like the baggy broke.

433
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:24,289
Yup, that's what happens when
you get the cheap implants.

434
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,358
Oh, my God, there is
definitely something

435
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,060
moving around in my bra.

436
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:31,396
Well, it's good you can
still recognize that feeling.

437
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:33,665
It's right... Oh!
Oh! I touched it!

438
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,033
Gross!

439
00:19:35,035 --> 00:19:37,202
Someone, put your hand
in my bra and help me.

440
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:40,105
Why now? Now that I'm off the market!

441
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,807
No, no, no, no, no, no.

442
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:44,409
I'm afraid I'm gonna
squish it and kill it again.

443
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:49,214
Okay, just get up on the
counter and drop it in the tank.

444
00:19:49,216 --> 00:19:50,582
What?

445
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:54,052
Get up on the counter, spread your legs,

446
00:19:54,054 --> 00:19:57,722
and just let it fall into the tank.

447
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,324
You know what?

448
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:03,128
Forget the back rub.
After this, we're square.

449
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:05,397
Okay, straddle the tank,
pull out your uniform,

450
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,332
and let it go.

451
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,601
Now I owe you money.

452
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,239
Just squat over the tank
like you're delivering

453
00:20:14,241 --> 00:20:16,307
a fish baby.

454
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,245
I'm delivering a fish baby?

455
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:22,480
This is where I'm at?

456
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:25,149
Stop asking. That's where you're at.

457
00:20:35,961 --> 00:20:40,865
Okay, now that I saw, right?

458
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,999
Caroline, get down!

459
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,468
It's not that kind of party.

460
00:20:49,908 --> 00:20:51,976
Max, you're really still
gonna send T-Rux back?

461
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,477
After we got bullied by a kid

462
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:56,047
with a Tiffani Amber Thiessen pillow?

463
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,317
Relax, T-Rux is right
over there by the register.

464
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,052
And by the way, he's our first employee.

465
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,421
Anytime we get a bone-head
customer, he can say,

466
00:21:03,423 --> 00:21:04,689
"Talk to the fist...

467
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:07,124
(Both) 'cause the face is pissed."

468
00:21:07,126 --> 00:21:08,893
I'm just sending my mother something

469
00:21:08,895 --> 00:21:10,828
to say thank you for
everything she gave me

470
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,129
when I was a child.

471
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:13,197
Aww, what's in there?

472
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:15,232
Nothing!
