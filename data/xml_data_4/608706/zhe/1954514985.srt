1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,330
<i>我要再看一眼.有人反对吗?</i>
<i>I wanna take another look.Anyone object?</i>

2
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,131
<i>不不,看吧,请便</i>
<i>No,go ahead.Be my guest.</i>

3
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,691
- 我从来没有见过那么多的钱 - 主啊
- I've never seen that much money. - Mercy.

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,328
看看这些.真是太夸张了
Look at that.That is awesome.

5
00:00:15,413 --> 00:00:18,450
- 你觉得这里有多少? - 我不知道.几千吧
- How much do you think there is? - I don't know.Thousands.

6
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:19,602
好了
All right.

7
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,884
我还是觉得我们应该交给警察
I still say we should take it to the police.

8
00:00:22,973 --> 00:00:26,602
等等,好吗.听我把话说完,行不?我们中的一个拿着这
Hold on,all right.Just hear me out,okay?One of us holds it.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,604
我们保留,大概,我不知道,30天
We check in,say,I don't know,30 days...

10
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:32,049
如果没有人来报告丢失,我们就三个人平分了
if nobody's reported it missing,then we split it between us.

11
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:37,243
是啊.好吧,就这样
Yeah.All right.Okay.

12
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:40,930
那么,谁来拿着?
So,who holds it?

13
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,884
- 我不介意 - 不
- I wouldn't mind. - No.

14
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,721
不,因为我都不认识你 我也不认识他
No,'cause I don't know you,and I don't know him.

15
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:49,804
我怎么能够假定你们不会消失?
How am I supposed to know you won't disappear?

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:51,849
是啊,他说到重点了
Yeah,he has got a point.

17
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,289
如果是我们在这里,他来照管呢?
What about if our man here,he looks after it?

18
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:01,171
为了证明他不是个小偷,我并不是说你就是...
But to prove he's not a thief,I'm not saying that you are...

19
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,971
他可以去银行.这太聪明了
he goes to the bank.This is brilliant.

20
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,202
取出...你有多少?
Take out...What you got?

21
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:06,011
我的社保账户里面有6000镑
I've got 6,000 in the building society.

22
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,802
你有6000镑,好,那就拿出来6000 给我们每人3000
You've got 6,000,okay.Takes out 6,000.Gives us 3,000 each.

23
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:11,645
- 而我则拿着箱子 - 当然
- But I keep the case? - Obviously.

24
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:13,052
我没什么问题
I ain't got a problem with that.

25
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:17,012
如果一个月内你都没有听到任何事情 我们就回来,一起分这个钱
If you don't hear anything in a month,we'll come back.Split the money.

26
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,728
- 好吧 - 是吧?好了,就这样吧
- Okay. - Yeah?Okay.Let's do it.

27
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:24,043
伙计,我们要发财了 我都不能相信
Man,we're gonna be so rich.I can't believe it.

28
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,647
今天早上我出来的时候,口袋里面就只有20镑
I came out this morning,I had 20 quid in my pocket.

29
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:30,487
而现在,我就能分到25000镑的三分之一了
Now,I'm looking at a third share in 25,000.

30
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:33,565
从天而降,碰巧就被我们找到了
It's like it just came out of the sky and we just found it there.

31
00:01:33,653 --> 00:01:35,689
天堂的礼物啊
Brought from heaven,or something.

32
00:01:37,893 --> 00:01:39,565
现在情况如何,Danny?
How's it going,Danny?

33
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,163
- 什么? - 比分
- What? - The score.

34
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:47,004
如果以1-10分来评判,你觉得有多少分?
How do you think it's going on a scale of 1 to 10?

35
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:49,682
或许9分?
A nine maybe?

36
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,246
9分左右
Nine-ish.

37
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,333
- 没有吗? - 问你的问题
- No? - Ask your question.

38
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:02,446
你怎么知道这个箱子里面有多少钱?
How do you know how much is in the case?

39
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,851
我们还没有数吗?
We didn't count it yet?

40
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,162
妈的
Shit.

41
00:02:23,453 --> 00:02:26,411
- 怎么了? - 他做的好事.走吧
- What happened? - He did.Come on.

飞天大盗 第1季第2集
S01E02 Faking It

46
00:04:02,133 --> 00:04:04,442
扑克千术的首要规则:
First rule of cheating at cards:

47
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:06,969
永远掩饰好你的动作
Always cover the move.

48
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:11,688
说错了.大动作掩护小动作
Misdirection.Big movement covers the small.

49
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:13,722
很简单的规则
Simple stuff.

50
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:18,924
还有,如果你可以的话,永远坐在门边
And,if you can,always sit by the door.

51
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,446
- 瞧,Mick - 算了吧
- Look,Mick. - Forget it.

52
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:34,650
不,我没有打算就此算了,好吗?好吧,我搞砸了
No,I don't want to forget it.All right?Okay,I screwed up.

53
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,122
是啊,你学到了什么?一句话来概括
Yeah,what did you learn?In a sentence.

54
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,932
按照预定的计划来做
Do it by the book.

55
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,248
这边走
This way.

56
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,689
你又搞砸了,Danny 我要把它刺在你的屁股上
You screw up again,Danny,I'll have it tattooed on your ass.

57
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:53,364
- 这个Frank Gorley是谁? - 魔鬼
- So who's this Frank Gorley? - Beelzebub.

58
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:57,967
我觉得我们可以以其人之道还治其人之身
I say we give him a taste of his own medicine.

59
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,322
我认识一些人
I know some people.

60
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:02,166
我可以以人头担保他们能以 任意一种方法来害你
I can personally vouch for how many places they can hurt you.

61
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:05,131
- 那不是我们要做的 - 那我们要做什么?
- That's not what we do. - What are we gonna do,then?

62
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:06,562
Ash?
Ash?

63
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,727
他在伦敦西区经营了一家旅馆和赌场
He runs a hotel and casino in the West End.

64
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,721
<i>赌场是他的爱好</i>
<i>The casino's bent.</i>

65
00:05:23,813 --> 00:05:26,771
<i>有人从东欧运送姑娘到他旅馆中</i>
<i>He ships in girls from Eastern Europe for the hotel.</i>

66
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:32,089
那些船家在赌桌上输掉了他们的钱 只能从匈牙利带姑娘过来
<i>Punters lose their money on the tables,then curl up with Hilda from Hungary.</i>

67
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,447
<i>他不是那种你可以随便对付的人</i>
<i>Not the sort of man you take liberties with.</i>

68
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:45,292
<i>事实上,如果我们有一份不要去的地方的列表...</i>
<i>In fact,if we had a list of places not to go...</i>

69
00:05:47,573 --> 00:05:49,529
他会列在最上面
he'd be right there at the top.

70
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,761
帮我找出个入口
Find me an in.

71
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:10,242
和以前一样
The usual.

72
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,088
我就差这一张牌就能成千王之王
I was one card short of a great hand.

73
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:55,489
或许我应该对你进行宵禁令
Maybe I should put you on a curfew.

74
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:58,969
你可以试试看啊
I'd like to see you try.

75
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:02,722
- 你不再是20岁的人了,Albert - 我就是
- You're not 20 years old anymore,Albert. - Yes,I am.

76
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:06,643
这里,就是这么认为的
Up here,where it counts.

77
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,802
- 你建立了一个非常不好的榜样 - 好吧
- You are setting a very bad example. - Good.

78
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:16,605
我听说你对小Danny很不好
I hear you're giving young Danny a hard time.

79
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:18,722
他搞砸了
He screwed up.

80
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,607
我们都搞砸了
We all screw up.

81
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:25,563
- 所以你接下来才会要考虑作什么 - 或许吧
- It's what you do next that counts. - Maybe.

82
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,851
他有诈骗的天分.你是教不了的
He's got grift sense.You can't teach that.

83
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:34,212
而且我不会永远在你旁边,你会需要他的
And I'm not gonna be around forever,so you'll need him.

84
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:40,412
让我来担心Danny吧.你好好休息一下
Let me worry about Danny.You just get some rest.

85
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,165
我们晚一些打电话给你
We'll call back later.

86
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:49,363
你还需要什么吗,Albie?
Is there anything you want,Albie?

87
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:53,688
3个护士和一桌的牌
Three nurses and a deck of cards.

88
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:05,133
我们要回旅馆和Ash碰面.看他找到了什么
We'll meet Ash back at the hotel.See what he's got.

89
00:08:05,213 --> 00:08:06,248
等等
Wait.

90
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:11,922
给我打电话
Call me.

91
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:21,166
- Peter? - 什么事?
- Peter? - Yes?

92
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,084
Maureen Phillips,媒体服务的
Maureen Phillips,media services.

93
00:08:23,173 --> 00:08:26,609
- 媒体? - 不好意思.你好
- Media? - Sorry.Hello.

94
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,846
我已经在做了
I'm already on it.

95
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:33,448
请告诉部长,一切都在掌握之中 他没有什么好担心的
Please tell the Minister it's all in hand.He has nothing to worry about.

96
00:08:33,533 --> 00:08:34,932
我现在就和Peter在一起
I'm with Peter now.

97
00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,328
是的
Yeah.

98
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:40,291
我回去的路上会打电话给你.好的
I'll call you as soon as I'm on my way back.Okay.

99
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:43,686
对不起.你知道那些政客的嘴脸
Sorry about that.You know what politicians are like.

100
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,922
是啊
Yes.

101
00:08:45,013 --> 00:08:46,651
事情是这样的,有人对我们泄漏说...
The thing is,we've been tipped off...

102
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:50,328
新闻局正在深入英国国民健康服务进行调查
that the press are conducting an investigation into NHS Trust services.

103
00:08:50,413 --> 00:08:53,405
- 而这家医院被打上了记号 - 我明白了
- And this hospital's been earmarked. - I see.

104
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:57,247
他们会选择一个病人并在 整个过程中跟踪他的情况...
They select a patient and follow his progress through the system...

105
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,164
并随时进行报告,直到他离开
debriefing him as and when he leaves.

106
00:08:59,253 --> 00:09:01,005
这件事情...
Well,the thing is...

107
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:03,402
他们选的那个病人是个老头儿...
The patient they've selected is an elderly man...

108
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:07,168
叫Albert Stroller?
called Albert Stroller?

109
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:10,163
上帝,我现在似乎就能看到报纸的标题了
God,I can just see the headlines now.

110
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,483
好的,瞧,我会马上着手...
Right,look,I'll get onto it...

111
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:15,212
找到他,Peter,像对待王子般对待他
Find him,Peter,treat him like a prince.

112
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,964
我们现在可都靠你了
We're all in your hands,now.

113
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,007
谢谢
Thank you.

114
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,204
如果我们一旦需要Albert...
If ever we needed Albert...

115
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:55,410
即使有入口,我也找不到
If there is an in,I can't find it.

116
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:58,053
瞧,我们知道他玩牌
Well,look,we know he plays cards.

117
00:09:58,253 --> 00:10:00,323
我们也知道他能发现千术
We also know he can spot a cheat.

118
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:01,688
女人?
Women?

119
00:10:01,773 --> 00:10:05,129
他有两打妓女可以随时使用,24除以7 但从来没有靠近过她们
He's got two dozen hookers on tap,2<i>4/</i>7,but doesn't go near them.

120
00:10:05,213 --> 00:10:08,205
我跟赌场的某个管理人员聊了一会儿.这个家伙很不合群
I spoke to one of the croupiers at the casino.The guy's a loner.

121
00:10:08,293 --> 00:10:10,124
他每天晚上都把自己锁在房间里面
He locks himself in his room every night.

122
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:11,487
- 没有朋友? - 没有,什么也没有
- No friends? - No,nothing.

123
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:13,086
- 亲戚,股东? - 不相信他们
- Stocks,shares? - Doesn't trust them.

124
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:15,164
一朝被蛇咬,十年怕井绳 发誓再也不会相信了
Dabbled once,lost heavily.Vowed never again.

125
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,403
这家伙斤斤计较,一毛不拔
The man's a block of ice.He calculates the odds.

126
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,324
他永远不会担一点风险
He never goes out on a limb.

127
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,165
至少我所能看见的他唯一 热爱的事情,就是极端地暴力
The only thing he's passionate about,as far as I can see,is extreme violence.

128
00:10:25,573 --> 00:10:27,529
有一件事情
There is one thing.

129
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,882
他总是随身携带笔记本电脑
He carries a laptop wherever he goes.

130
00:10:32,493 --> 00:10:36,532
如果他有弱点的话,这是我们唯一 可以从中发现的地方
If he has got a weakness,that's where we'll find it.

131
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,848
<i>很好,能给Danny一个机会来向我们 展示他学到了多少</i>
<i>Good,it'll give Danny a chance to show us how much he's learned.</i>

132
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,807
我们怎么做?
How we doing?

133
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,563
就看我们花在布局上的精力和时间了
Depends how much we spend on the set up.

134
00:10:59,653 --> 00:11:02,372
不管怎么样,他都惹到了Albert
Whatever it takes.He put his hands on Albert.

135
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,008
但我在书上看到说 "永远不要让你的情感控制理智"
But I thought the book says,"Never let your heart rule your head."

136

00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:02,164
Albert告诉我如果我觉得在和骗子说话...
Albert told me that if I ever thought I was talking to a con man...

280
00:28:02,253 --> 00:28:03,481
就一直说不
just keep saying no.

281
00:28:03,573 --> 00:28:06,963
我们不是要骗你,Eddie,我们是在找你帮忙
We're not trying to con you,Eddie,we're asking for your help.

282
00:28:10,862 --> 00:28:13,217
- 3天? - 最多
- Three days? - Tops.

283
00:28:13,862 --> 00:28:15,693
- 为了Albert? - 绝对
- For Albert? - Absolutely.

284
00:28:17,142 --> 00:28:19,656
如果我没有拿回我的钱,你们就都被我隔绝了
If I don't get paid back,you're all barred.

285
00:28:29,742 --> 00:28:31,016
很高兴见到你
Good seeing you.

286
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,376
- 怎么样? - 很好
- How you doing? - Okay.

287
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:35,056
- 我们在这里干嘛? - 来吧,放松点
- What are we doing here? - Come on,just relax.

288
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:36,814
Frank,这是Jeff Machin
Frank,this is Jeff Machin.

289
00:28:36,902 --> 00:28:39,735
Jeff,这是Frank Gorley.他掌管这个地方
Jeff,this is Frank Gorley.He owns this place.

290
00:28:43,102 --> 00:28:44,979
傲慢的家伙
Arrogant asshole.

291
00:28:45,102 --> 00:28:47,980
- 他有什么问题? - 你告诉我吧
- What's his problem? - You tell me.

292
00:28:48,302 --> 00:28:50,896
去年我帮这个家伙赚了3百万美元...
I made the guy $3 million last year...

293
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:53,337
而他对我就像是雇佣来的一样
he treats me like the hired help.

294
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,891
不好意思,Frank
Excuse me,Frank.

295
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:59,736
- 这些混蛋在骗我 - Joe,冷静下来,好吗?
- These bastards are cheating on me. - Joe,just calm down,okay?

296
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,050
我给你弄点咖啡
Let's get you a coffee.

297
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:05,579
我不要咖啡,我要再来一杯 你们这帮骗人的混蛋!
I don't want a coffee,I want another drink.You cheating bastards!

298
00:29:07,102 --> 00:29:09,058
对不起,Frank.没事的
I'm sorry,Frank.It's okay.

299
00:29:09,142 --> 00:29:11,576
- 你的朋友需要上堂礼仪课 - 我知道
- Your friend needs a lesson in manners. - I know.

300
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,222
你这里有谁可以把他送回家的吗?
You got somebody who can maybe run him home?

301
00:29:16,142 --> 00:29:17,211
什么?
What?

302
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:23,774
Joe或许不喜欢输钱 但他有很强的关系
Joe might not like to lose his money,but he's got very powerful connections.

303
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:27,060
他是史泰龙的一个私交
He's a personal friend of Sly Stallone.

304
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:30,214
我答应我会看着他的
And I promised that I'd keep an eye on him.

305
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:32,982
他认识史泰龙?
He knows Sly Stallone?

306
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:37,934
也不是很认识他,更熟悉他的妈妈
Well,it's not so much Sly,it's more his mother.

307
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:41,779
- 我可以买下这个地方 - 他住在Grovesnor
- I could buy this place. - He's staying at the Grovesnor.

308
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,219
把这里关掉吧,把它变成一堆屎
Close it down,turn it into a shithole.

309
00:29:48,942 --> 00:29:52,821
对不起,Frank.我要跟Jeff谈谈
I'm sorry,Frank.I gotta talk to Jeff.

310
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:54,779
你有什么安静点的地方吗?
You got anywhere quiet?

311
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,453
- 有 - 谢谢
- Yeah. - Thank you.

312
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:04,133
他是个醉鬼.我不要和他一起工作
He's a drunk.I don't want to work with him.

313
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:05,257
来吧,Joe没事的
Come on,Joe's okay.

314
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:07,572
如果这次他在其中,那就不要算我
If he's in this time,then count me out.

315
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:10,495
- 我向你保证 - 那你们两个都走开
- I gave you my word. - Then screw him and screw you.

316
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:14,451
和你一起做生意的人可是有 很严重的态度问题啊
The people you do business with have got a really bad attitude problem.

317
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,611
你知道吗?
You know that?

318
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:16,691
帮我个忙,朋友?
Do me a favor,pal?

319
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,977
少管和你无关的事
Keep your nose out of what doesn't concern you.

320
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,893
好了,够了
Okay,that's enough.

321
00:30:21,062 --> 00:30:23,371
你要管好你的嘴,孩子
You want to watch your mouth,boy.

322
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:26,852
对不起,Frank,Jeff只是很讨厌Joe
I'm sorry,Frank,Jeff's just wound up about Joe.

323
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:31,095
好吧,好吧,不带他了
Okay,look.All right.He's out.

324
00:30:31,382 --> 00:30:33,373
那我要找其他人来帮他收尾
I'll get somebody else to cover his end.

325
00:30:33,462 --> 00:30:35,373
这里是Frank的办公室...
Now,this is Frank's office...

326
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:38,218
还是要有些尊重的
a bit of respect wouldn't go amiss.

327
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:41,375
- 你找到买主了吗? - 都会安排妥当的
- You found a buyer yet? - It's all in place.

328
00:30:41,462 --> 00:30:44,181
我们在15000镑的时候买进 等到60000的时候再出来
We buy in at 15,000,we get back 60,000.

329
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:45,981
这就是电影的特殊之处
That's film extras.

330
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,533
在所有的演员中介里面 他们试图对每个带有...
In all the casting agencies,they try and strike up an exclusive...

331
00:30:49,622 --> 00:30:51,340
强大预算的电影构造一个专有权
with any movie with a decent budget.

332
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:53,572
这只是盛大安排中的一个小土豆...
It's small potatoes in the grand scheme of things...

333
00:30:53,662 --> 00:30:55,573
但是,嘿,每一点都是要计算的,不是吗?
but,hey,every little counts,right?

334
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:57,095
除了我们刚失去了Joe
Except we just lost Joe.

335
00:30:57,182 --> 00:30:58,934
- 我说了,我会来操心的 - 怎么弄?
- I said,I'd take care of it. - How?

336
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:01,616
这是桩现金交易.我们可是要在早餐的时候 和制片人见面的...
This is a cash deal.We meet the producer at breakfast...

337
00:31:01,702 --> 00:31:03,454
而那是银行还没有开门
before the banks open.

338
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:07,335
你知道吗?
You know what?

339
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:10,892
话说回来,我很高兴Joe已经出局了
Screw the deal,I'm glad Joe's out of it.

340
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:14,498
这个家伙只对净赚的有兴趣 他什么都不懂
The guy's only interested in the bottom line.He's got no soul.

341
00:31:15,062 --> 00:31:18,259
你知道他最喜欢的电影是什么吗,Frank?<i>兰博</i>
You know what his favorite film is,Frank?<i>Rambo.</i>

342
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:20,617
你怎么会和这样的家伙做生意的呢?
How are you gonna do business with a guy like that?

343
00:31:20,702 --> 00:31:24,456
- Bogart,Cagney,他们才是演电影的 - 你喜欢Cagney?
- Bogart,Cagney,now they made movies. - You like Cagney?

344
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:26,453
他真是前无古人,后无来者
No one like him,before or since.

345
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:27,941
- 最好的电影?<i>- 白热杀机</i>
- Best film?<i>- White Heat.</i>

346
00:31:28,022 --> 00:31:29,614
- "成了!妈!" - "世界之巅"
- "Made it,Ma." - "Top of the world."

347
00:31:29,702 --> 00:31:32,774
好电影,但不是他最好的 你知道他曾经是个舞者么?
Good film,but not his best.Do you know he was a dancer?

348
00:31:32,862 --> 00:31:34,978
- 在电影中穿插舞蹈? - 是的
- Came up through vaudeville? - That's right.

349
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:37,496
电影中最好的歌者和舞者
Best song and dance man in the business.

350
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,655
你们两个讨论结束的话,我们是否能回到手头的正事上来?
When you two have finished,can we get back to the job in hand?

351
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,211
可以
Yeah.

352
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:47,574
到底是什么问题?
So what is this deal exactly?

353
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:50,574
是和制作人的问题,额外的合同
The deal is with the producer,for the extras contract.

354
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:53,176
我们和他见面,付清他的钱 然后去片场...
We meet him,pay him off,then go to the set...

355
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:55,492
从中介那家伙处去搜集钱
and collect from the guy from the agency.

356
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,413
- 片场? - 是的
- A film set? - Yeah.

357
00:31:57,542 --> 00:32:01,217
问题是,就像Jeff说的,我们少了Joe 所以缺了5000镑
Trouble is,like Jeff says,we lost Joe so we're 5,000 light.

358
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,852
我直说吧
Let me get this straight.

359
00:32:04,582 --> 00:32:06,857
你们给这个制片人15000镑...
You take this producer 15,000...

360
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:10,651
然后就开车到片场去搜集60000镑?
then you drive over to the film set and collect 60,000?

361
00:32:10,982 --> 00:32:13,098
差不多就是这个意思
That's about the strength of it.

362
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:16,699
如果我提供了你们缺的5000镑呢?
So what if I put up the 5,000 you're light?

363
00:32:16,782 --> 00:32:21,173
只要我提供了Joe这个家伙的份 那他的那份回报也就给我
So long as I pick up his share,this guy Joe's share,in return.

364
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,578
- 没门 - 我没有在和你说
- No way. - I wasn't talking to you.

365
00:32:23,662 --> 00:32:25,061
你要让这个家伙硬挤进来吗?
You gonna let this guy muscle in?

366
00:32:25,142 --> 00:32:28,691
他所做的只是接管Joe的部分 那又有什么区别呢?
All he'd be doing is taking over Joe's share.What difference does it make?

367
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:30,101
我都不认识这个家伙
I don't even know this guy.

368
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:32,935
看在上帝的份上,这个猪头现在要给我们支票啊
For God's sake,the lame brain's gonna give us a check now.

369
00:32:33,022 --> 00:32:36,981
- Jeff,拜托,求你了.放松点 - 好吧
- Jeff,come on,please.Just relax. - All right.

370
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:40,220
必须是要现金的,Frank.对不起
It does have to be cash,Frank.I'm sorry.

371
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,616
你可不可以礼貌一些?
You gonna be polite?

372
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:54,377
Frank帮我们脱离Joe呢 至少我们可以让他插进来吧
Frank helped us out with Joe.Cutting him in is the least we can do.

373
00:33:05,302 --> 00:33:06,291
谢谢,Frank
Thanks,Frank.

374
00:33:06,382 --> 00:33:10,375
就像我说的,我喜欢钱在我能看见的地方
Like I said,I like my money where I can see it.

375
00:33:11,262 --> 00:33:12,775
我和你们一起去
I'm coming with you.

376
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:15,291
好的
All right.

377
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:09,055
我要叫了
I'll call.

378
00:34:15,942 --> 00:34:17,341
3个7
Three sevens.

379
00:34:21,062 --> 00:34:22,051
同花
Flush.

380
00:34:28,542 --> 00:34:29,531
再来
Again.

381
00:34:50,702 --> 00:34:52,897
- Pete - 你倒是很及时嘛
- Pete. - You took your time.

382
00:34:52,982 --> 00:34:54,495
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you,too.

383
00:34:54,582 --> 00:34:58,131
钱在那个口开着的袋子里面 先把那个给Danny
The money's in the one with the flap open,so give that one to Danny first.

384
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,974
- 什么时候? - 尽快吧
- How long? - Any minute now.

385
00:35:00,062 --> 00:35:01,734
记住不要让别人看见
Just be out of sight.

386
00:35:20,822 --> 00:35:23,973
我告诉过你了,Lucy 不拿开那条绳子我就走
I've told you,Lucy,either the line goes or I do.

387
00:35:24,462 --> 00:35:26,737
哦,耶酥基督,去告诉他们!
Well,Jesus Christ!Go and tell them.

388
00:35:27,382 --> 00:35:29,532
- Jenny亲爱的 - Jason
- Jenny baby. - Jason.

389
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:30,897
怎么样了?
How's it going?

390
00:35:30,982 --> 00:35:33,416
导演是个蠢蛋 你能帮我开了他吗?
The director's a moron.Can't you fire him for me?

391
00:35:33,502 --> 00:35:36,380
亲爱的,我可以.但他会让我先滚蛋
Baby,I could,but he'd sue my ass off.

392
00:35:36,742 --> 00:35:39,893
这是我的一个很好的朋友,这是Frank Gorley
This is a very good friend of mine.This is Frank Gorley.

393
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,973
- 很高兴见到你,Frank - 你好?
- Glad to meet you,Frank. - How do you do?

394
00:35:42,062 --> 00:35:44,781
好了,来吧,现在,回去工作 时间就是金钱
Okay,come on,now.Back to work.Time is money.

395
00:35:44,982 --> 00:35:46,859
他真是个苛刻的老板
He's such a slave driver.

396
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:51,177
- 那是Jenny Cole? - 你认识她?
- That's Jenny Cole? - You know her?

397
00:35:51,262 --> 00:35:54,459
- 我今天早上看到她的新闻 - 她会成为巨星的
- I was reading about her this morning. - She's gonna be huge.

398
00:35:54,542 --> 00:35:56,772
他们把她称为奥黛丽・赫本第二
They're calling her the new Audrey Hepburn.

399
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:58,932
- Jason - 你好吗?
- Jason. - How you doing?

400
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:00,900
不错.交易还算数?
Okay.We still on?

401
00:36:00,982 --> 00:36:02,131
已经搞定了
It's a done deal.

402
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:05,897
很好,我有200个超级崇拜的小明星 真等着点头呢,拿着
Great,I've got 200 wannabe starlets waiting for the nod,here.

403
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:09,299
- 你们要来帮我选吗? - 不,我们委托你了,好吗?
- You fellas wanna help me pick? - No,we'll leave that,all right?

404
00:36:09,382 --> 00:36:12,180
你是准备说上一整天还是就把我的钱给我?
You gonna talk all day or you gonna give me my money?

405
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:16,695
就像他说的,分成3份了
Split three ways,just like he said.

406
00:36:16,782 --> 00:36:18,500
漂亮
That's beautiful.

407
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:26,098
20,000.一个半小时的回馈,不错吧
20,000.Not a bad return for half an hour,is it?

408
00:36:28,182 --> 00:36:31,618
- 看起来Joe的损失是我的获利嘛 - 我想是的
- Looks like Joe's loss is my gain. - I guess so.

409
00:36:34,302 --> 00:36:35,770
既然我们都到了这里
While we're here,

410
00:36:35,771 --> 00:36:38,853
何不逛逛这个片场,看看是如何拍电影的呢?
any chance of walking around the set,watching a bit of filming?

411
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:44,413
Frank,我要回去了.要去摆平Joe
Frank,I gotta get back.Square things up with Joe.

412
00:36:45,062 --> 00:36:46,973
我以为Joe已经不再参与了呢
I thought Joe was out of the picture.

413
00:36:47,062 --> 00:36:49,132
他还在里面,在做笔大生意
He is for this but not the big one.

414
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:51,982
- 大生意? - 闭嘴,Jason
- Big one? - Shut your mouth,Jason.

415
00:36:52,542 --> 00:36:54,976
- 我说什么了吗? - 上车吧
- Did I say anything? - Just get in the car.

00:36:59,022 --> 00:37:02,173
有谁问起我的话,就告诉他们我5分钟之前离开了

421
00:37:43,342 --> 00:37:46,334
- 是个诱饵 - 诱饵?
- It was bait. - Bait?

422
00:37:47,862 --> 00:37:50,137
我们一切还顺利吧?
So did we get the green light?

我们今晚会和他摊牌
We tell him the tale tonight.

你能在Jen玩牌的时候找个人看着她吗?

00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:31,898
不要让Cole小姐受到打扰

433
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:34,457
- 好好玩吧 - 谢谢,Frank

434
00:38:36,702 --> 00:38:39,216
- 我们能喝一杯吗? - 当然

435
00:38:39,662 --> 00:38:41,459
Joe怎么样了?
How did it go with Joe?

436
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:44,935
- 这个家伙是个蠢蛋 - 我6个月前就告诉你了
- The guy's a fruit loop. - I told you that six months ago.

437
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,138
真是羞愧啊,我还有些喜欢他呢,你知道吗?
It's a shame,I kind of liked him,you know?

438
00:38:47,222 --> 00:38:49,531
- 但这可是在做买卖 - 是是是
- But this is business. - Yeah.

439
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:52,979
那那个大生意是什么东西?
So what about the big one?

440
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:59,091
- 你之前有提起过 - Jeff?
- You mentioned it earlier. - Jeff?

441
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:03,261
好了,Frank,坐下
Okay,Frank,sit down.

442
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:04,331
告诉他吧
Tell him.

443
00:39:06,462 --> 00:39:11,013
我们准备要制作部电影 低成本的.大概是5百万英镑
We're gonna make a movie.Kind of low budget.Say about 5,000,000.

444
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:14,857
而Jenny觉得现在是她转型的时候...
Jenny thinks it's her big break in the States...

445
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:18,571
但我们真正想在亚洲赚钱
but where we're really gonna make our money is in Asia.

446
00:39:19,222 --> 00:39:20,211
亚洲?
Asia?

447
00:39:20,662 --> 00:39:24,098
- 我能坦白讲吗,Frank? - 请
- Can I be frank,Frank? - Please.

448
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:27,174
在其他的人正盯着家庭市场的时候...
While everyone else is looking at the home market...

449
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:31,172
我们先把影片直接卖给亚洲
we sell the video rights to Asia up front.

450
00:39:32,622 --> 00:39:34,499
我们可以直接给出价钱
We can virtually name our price.

451
00:39:34,582 --> 00:39:37,972
那样我们可以不费吹灰之力就能赚到1千万英镑
I figure we're gonna get 10 million without breaking a sweat.

452
00:39:39,222 --> 00:39:44,012
- 她同意那么做? - 她昨天已经签订合同了
- And she's agreed to do it? - She signed the contract yesterday.

453
00:39:44,542 --> 00:39:46,021
Joe在里面还是不在?
So is Joe in or out?

454
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:49,220
他还想进来,但你知道这些乌合之众是如何的
He still wants in,but you know what these Mob guys are like.

455
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:50,781
他们还是有点钱的
They're a liability.

456
00:39:50,982 --> 00:39:52,574
这是净赚的,Frank:
Bottom line is,Frank:

457
00:39:52,662 --> 00:39:56,098
如果你想分一羹的话 我可以帮你
If you want a slice of the cake,I can make it happen.

458
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,533
我们要投入多少钱?
How much are we talking about?

459
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:03,699
你要投入的跟我和Jeff一样多
It's gonna be the same as me and Jeff are in for.

460
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:05,819
20万左右吧
That's 200 big ones.

461
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,181
20万英镑?
200,000?

462
00:40:08,942 --> 00:40:10,660
而保证是...
With a guarantee...

463
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,417
你可以在3个月之内收回双倍的回馈
that you're gonna get double your money back in three months.

464
00:40:18,742 --> 00:40:20,937
不,我觉得我还是不要了
No,I think I'll pass.

465
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:22,891
什么?
What?

466
00:40:23,262 --> 00:40:26,493
我最多出到15000镑,再多我就退出了
I'm 15,000 up.I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.

467
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:29,858
- 如果我们... - 我们可以找到别人的
- What if we... - We can find someone else.

468
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:32,178
这不是问题,好吗?
It's not a problem,okay?

469
00:40:33,902 --> 00:40:36,052
- 我们刚才要的酒呢? - 当然
- How about that drink? - Sure.

470
00:40:49,982 --> 00:40:51,893
你要认识到一件事情,Dan
You've got to pick it up,Dan.

471
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:53,934
你在跟这个家伙谈钱
You're talking to this guy about money.

472
00:40:54,022 --> 00:40:56,661
他被钱所包围,而不是被钱困扰
He's surrounded by money,he's not fazed by it.

473
00:40:56,742 --> 00:40:59,336
你给他的是一些他已经有的东西
You're offering him something he's already got.

474
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:02,220
你要想想什么能带给我们比钱更多的
You've gotta think about what brought us this far.

475
00:41:02,742 --> 00:41:07,258
你能不能给他一些他从其他地方 所得不到的东西?
What can you give him that he can't get anywhere else?

476
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:11,981
不要跟他的头脑说话,要跟他的心去说 是情感而不是理智
Don't talk to his head,talk to his heart.Emotion not reason.

477
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:16,857
想想吧

我让这该死的剧本弄得头都大了

你要我帮你对这些台词吗?

492
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:39,617
你介意吗?
Would you mind?

493
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:41,658
我告诉你吧,为什么不让Frank帮你呢?
I tell you what.Why doesn't Frank help you?

- He checked out of the hotel first thing. - So what's the problem?

526
00:46:07,582 --> 00:46:09,254
他不会再现身了
He wasn't in the picture anyway.

527
00:46:09,342 --> 00:46:13,460
他在银行有联合签名 我还没有来得及去修改
He was co-signature at the bank.I didn't have time to change it.

528
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,132
他在离开之前将我们一扫而空

536
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:38,933
- 那就去拿回来! - 我不能!
- Go get it back! - I can't!

537
00:46:41,062 --> 00:46:44,054
他认为在我们先把他排除在外时 我们就他在躲避他
He figures we welched on him first when we cut him out.

How's he doing?

552
00:47:56,302 --> 00:47:59,021
他们正在给他做手术 Gorley怎么样了?
They're operating on him now.What about Gorley?

553
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:03,892
他躲起来了.他以为自己杀死了Danny 所以就躲起来了
He's laying low.He thinks he killed Danny,so he'll stay that way.
