<!--a5-->1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,929
Kids, sometimes your relationship 
goes so smoothly for so long

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,143
that you think it will be 
that way forever.

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,421
It never is.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,739
Well, we just had our first fight.

5
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,186
We had our first fight.

6
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,911
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,861
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,340
A few months ago, 
my architecture firm was approached

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,567
to design this new building...

10
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:24,823
It's this big skyscraper 
in Spokane.

11
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:26,591
It'd be a huge project 
for his firm.

12
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,693
And if we don't get it, 
we could go under.

13
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:31,732
So anyway, the head architect 
unveils his new design

14
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:33,163
to the whole company.

15
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,080
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,213
Yes.

17
00:00:41,226 --> 00:00:44,260
All skyscrapers 
kind of look like a...

18
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:47,963
Marshall, 
it's a 78-story pink marble tower

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,540
with a rounded top

20
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:52,451
and two spherical 
entryways at the front.

21
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,360
Wow, so it's the whole package.

22
00:00:54,377 --> 00:00:56,422
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

23
00:00:56,547 --> 00:00:59,113
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, 
you got to get me in.

24
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:00,451
And don't give me the shaft.

25
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,301
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

26
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,602
It's a travesty.

27
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,562
It's gonna define 
the skyline of the city.

28
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:09,103
If it was me, I could've 
designed something amazing.

29
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:12,112
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours 
a day designing the cornices.

30
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,872
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.

31
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,073
So you and Ted 
had your first fight.

32
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,752
It obviously ended well. 
I mean, you're here with me.

33
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:34,573
Actually, 
it didn't end at all.

34
00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:36,671
I started getting bummed out, 
so I came here.

35
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:37,672
It's what I do.

36
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,513
When my grandma died, 
I got a perm.

37
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:42,551
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

38
00:01:43,558 --> 00:01:45,892
The thing is, 
Ted has been literally

39
00:01:45,908 --> 00:01:48,323
complaining about work 
nonstop for weeks.

40
00:01:48,335 --> 00:01:51,833
So, when I came over today, 
I was kind of done.

41
00:01:51,898 --> 00:01:53,192
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:01:53,206 --> 00:01:55,190
- How was your day?
- Good.

43
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,032
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

44
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,280
Aren't you gonna ask 
how my day was?

45
00:02:00,298 --> 00:02:02,923
No, I know how it was. 
It was awful.

46
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:05,233
Ooh, you want to rent 
a movie tonight?

47
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:06,872
You know, um...

48
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:09,233
I listen to your work 
stories all the time.

49
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,832
Yeah, but... 
and I don't want to be rude here,

50
00:02:11,847 --> 00:02:14,442
but my work stories 
are interesting.

51
00:02:14,456 --> 00:02:16,511
I'm a television news reporter.

52
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,592
- Robin...
- What?

53
00:02:18,607 --> 00:02:20,353
I knew exactly
 what he was going to say.

54
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,060
I was just helping him 
get there faster.

55
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:26,020
You should work 
at a suicide hotline.

56
00:02:26,555 --> 00:02:28,172
And then it got ugly.

57
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:31,852
What I don't do is tell you 
the same story over and over again.

58
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,753
I mean, you wouldn't 
watch the same movie

59
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:35,590
over and over again, would you?

60
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,622
Maybe a great movie 
like Die Hard.

61
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:40,280
But Field of Dreams?

62
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,493
Once is more than enough.

63
00:02:45,568 --> 00:02:47,592
So that's your go-to bad movie?

64
00:02:47,606 --> 00:02:49,590
The number one example 
on the tip of your tongue

65
00:02:49,605 --> 00:02:52,372
of a bad movie is 
Field of Dreams?

66
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:54,711
It's about 
ghost baseball players.

67
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,322
I think it's stupid.

68
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:03,611
So, now he's all mad at me 
about the stupid movie.

69
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,382
Robin, he's upset because 
you wouldn't listen to him,

70
00:03:06,397 --> 00:03:08,532
not because you didn't like 
some movie.

71
00:03:08,547 --> 00:03:11,740
How do you not like 
Field of Dreams?!

72
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:16,462
Listening is the foundation 
of a relationship.

73
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,093
And if he's really droning on,

74
00:03:18,105 --> 00:03:20,592
you can always practice 
saying the alphabet backwards.

75
00:03:20,605 --> 00:03:23,061
You know, in case 
you get pulled over for a DUI.

76
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,551
I guess I don't know 
how to do that.

77
00:03:24,566 --> 00:03:26,990
Yeah, it's really hard, 
even when you're sober.

78
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:28,961
That's what I tried 
to explain to the cop.

79
00:03:28,977 --> 00:03:32,751
No,  I mean, I guess I don't know 
how to do this girlfriend thing.

80
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:36,132
I've never been in a relationship 
this serious before.

81
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,190
I should probably go tell him 
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

82
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,793
You're trying to do it right now, 
aren't you?

83
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:46,372
What the hell comes before "Q"?

84
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:50,873
Then at the end of the movie when 
he has a catch with his dad, like...

85
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:54,472
like he never did when he was 
young enough for it to matter.

86
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:57,772
Can we talk about something else?

87
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,583
You know what, dude?

88
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:01,901
Forget about Robin, okay? 
You're hanging with us tonight.

89
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:03,783
I've got an awome party lined up.

90
00:04:03,796 --> 00:04:05,182
Oh, God.

91
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:08,850
This gonna be another one 
of your weird all-guy parties?

92
00:04:08,868 --> 00:04:12,012
That was a poker game. 
What is wrong with you?

93
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:14,540
No, it's the first law school 
party of the year

94
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,090
and it's gonna be awesome.

95
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:18,002
I haven't seen this guys since, 
like, last year

96
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:19,570
before Lily and I broke up.

97
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:21,873
So I'm gonna have 
to break the news to everybody.

98
00:04:21,888 --> 00:04:23,843
It's really gonna bum them out.

99
00:04:24,488 --> 00:04:26,403
This party's gonna suck.

100
00:04:27,057 --> 00:04:29,842
Well, love to join you at that one.

101
00:04:30,156 --> 00:04:32,692
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

102
00:04:32,748 --> 00:04:34,510
I wish I could join you guys, 
but I got to get back

103
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,581
to my apparently boring job.

104
00:04:36,597 --> 00:04:39,123
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.

105
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:41,462
Dude, lots of chicks 
think architects are hot.

106
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:44,023
Think about it, 
you create something out of nothing.

107
00:04:44,036 --> 00:04:45,173
You're like God.

108
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,212
There's nobody hotter than God.

109
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:49,170
I love it when you quote Scripture.

110
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm telling you, you should use 
the architect angle with the ladies.

111
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:55,541
Okay, first of all, 
I have a girlfriend.

112
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,010
Second, the architect angle 
doesn't even work on her.

113
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:00,943
And, third, I can't imagine 
that working on anyone ever.

114
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:03,303
That's 'cause you're always like...

115
00:05:03,316 --> 00:05:06,621
Ted Mosby, architect.

116
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,832
If it were me, I'd be like...

117
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,452
Ted Mosby, architect.

118
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:16,680
Anything sounds impressive when 
it's said with the right attitude.

119
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,801
Marshall Ericksen.

120
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,501
Recently dumped 
and heading to a lame party.

121
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:24,150
Whoa. Whoa, ladies, 
please take it easy.

122
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:25,381
There's enough of me for everyone.

123
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,822
Oh. Hi. Hello.

124
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:29,873
All right. We're gonna take off..

125
00:05:29,888 --> 00:05:31,832
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

126
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,350
Ted Mosby, architect.

127
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,010
Trust  me.

128
00:05:47,415 --> 00:05:49,413
Hey, just out of curiosity.

129
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,141
If a guy told you 
he was an architect,

130
00:05:51,157 --> 00:05:52,573
what would you think of that?

131
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:53,731
Are  you kidding?

132
00:05:53,745 --> 00:05:55,962
Architects are hot.

133
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:59,340
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

134
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:00,991
Solid point.

135
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,953
She did have hair of gold.

136
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:04,921
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,560
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

138
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,580
No.

139
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:13,443
Hey, Lily.

140
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,783
- You still single?
- Yes.

141
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:19,411
You know... I've poured a lot of 
free drinks for you over the years.

142
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,823
A lot.

143
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:23,220
Carl, do you really want 
to be with a woman

144
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:25,461
who would trade sex for beer?

145
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,413
Only if you're into it.

146
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,722
It's on me.

147
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,263
Thanks.

148
00:06:31,277 --> 00:06:32,892
I wonder where Ted went.

149
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,470
Ted Mosby, the architect?

150
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:37,610
Actually, yeah.

151
00:06:37,628 --> 00:06:39,792
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

152
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,312
He was here earlier.

153
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:44,690
And what made you decide 
you wanted to become an architect?

154
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:47,310
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

155
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:49,632
hands of a master craftsman.

156
00:06:49,646 --> 00:06:51,913
It was inevitable, I guess.

157
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:54,370
I bet you can draw, can't you?

158
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:56,862
You should draw me.

159
00:06:56,878 --> 00:07:01,123
Well, I could try, but you might end up 
looking like a midcentury tri-level.

160
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:06,070
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall 
invited me to this party we could all go to.

161
00:07:06,088 --> 00:07:07,870
Marshall's great. 
He's just a lawyer,

162
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,161
but somebody has to push the paper 
around for us creative types.

163
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:12,643
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

164
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:17,570
He asked her to a party. 
Oh, my God, are you okay?

165
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:19,970
Okay? It's awesome. 
It's a win-win.

166
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:22,121
Ted got to vent 
and I don't have to hear it.

167
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:24,321
Maybe after he's done with 
the talkie-talk, he'll come over

168
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,841
and I'll get the fun part.

169
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,623
What is wrong with you?

170
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:32,111
God, I feel like I'm teaching 
love as a second language here.

171
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:35,002
Okay, you know how when 
he tells you boring work stories

172
00:07:35,016 --> 00:07:36,450
you're supposed to listen?

173
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,423
Well, when he picks up 
some random girl at a bar,

174
00:07:39,448 --> 00:07:41,080
you're supposed to freak out.

175
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:44,472
I'm not freaking out 
because in my mind, she's fat.

176
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:47,263
She's a kickboxing instructor.

177
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:50,503
Her ass looks better than my face.

178
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:53,323
All right, we'll swing by the party.

179
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,753
Now the party was for 
some of Marshall's classmates

180
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:59,550
from Columbia Law School,

181
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:01,261
who by day were some of the sharpest

182
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,233
and most serious 
young legal minds in the country.

183
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:06,180
By night, however...

184
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,043
Damn, these are some 
drunk almost-lawyers.

185
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,781
Okay! Seriously...

186
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:15,691
who wants to shave my ass?!

187
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,982
That guy went on to become 
a Supreme Court justice.

188
00:08:20,186 --> 00:08:22,543
Okay, where are 
the guys and the hooker?

189
00:08:22,557 --> 00:08:26,292
Yo, what's up, ladies? 
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

190
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,303
Just need you to sign 
this release protecting the host

191
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,091
from any and all responsibility 
should you harm yourself

192
00:08:30,106 --> 00:08:31,212
or a third party.

193
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,941
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

194
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:36,961
Hey, drunk legal dude, um... 
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

195
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:38,512
He was with a guy named Ted.

196
00:08:38,526 --> 00:08:40,610
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

197
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:42,262
Man, what a visionary.

198
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,373
Yeah, they were here.

199
00:08:45,357 --> 00:08:48,353
Awards are nice, 
they look good on my shelf.

200
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,882
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

201
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:54,102
of seeing the sun rise over 
your first building.

202
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,421
Wow.

203
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:58,322
I would love to watch 
the sun rise with you.

204
00:08:58,335 --> 00:09:00,303
I know you would.

205
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,500
It's the job.

206
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:06,290
Dude. You should let us 
shave your ass tonight.

207
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:08,143
No way.

208
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:11,511
Hey,  Marshall, where's Lily?

209
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:16,482
I didn't want to ruin the party 
for everybody this early, but, uh...

210
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:18,793
everyone take a seat.

211
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,371
Um... Lily actually called off 
the wedding this summer

212
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,371
to go to San Francisco.

213
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,901
So...

214
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,942
we're broken up.

215
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,542
Her name wasn't on 
your lease, was it?

216
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,882
'Cause if not, New York state law, 
you're not obligated

217
00:09:36,896 --> 00:09:39,372
to give her half the deposit 
when you move.

218
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:42,303
Yeah, that's not really the part 
I was worried about, guys.

219
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:45,913
And don't forget the precedent set 
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

220
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:48,132
Any personal effects she left 
in your house or dwelling

221
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:51,012
become yours after 30 days.

222
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:55,803
Guys, can we cease and desist 
with the lawyer speak for a minute?

223
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,430
Love died.

224
00:09:57,446 --> 00:10:01,191
The love that made you all believe 
in love, that's dead now.

225
00:10:03,975 --> 00:10:05,372
You should sue her.

226
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:07,053
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

227
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:10,231
On the grounds of... shut up.

228
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,613
That's our attorney general.

229
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:19,482
See? Marshall's still hung up 
on our breakup.

230
00:10:19,497 --> 00:10:21,713
Why? Because I listened to him.

231
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:24,402
It was a strong 
and nurturing relationship

232
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,551
that I threw away like old gum.

233
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:30,893
Not that I'm worried or anything, 
but, um, back to the sun rising

234
00:10:30,906 --> 00:10:34,431
over Ted and, uh... oh, 
what tasteful way did you describe her?

235
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:36,302
The girl with the smackable ass.

236
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,773
Yes, that's the young lady.

237
00:10:39,367 --> 00:10:43,510
So, I know the bouncer 
at this techno club, Posers.

238
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:45,290
Do you feel like dancing?

239
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,152
Yeah, okay. 
There is no way Ted went dancing.

240
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:49,593
Ted hates clubs.

241
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:52,063
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

242
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:54,341
I mean, I was going to design 
a cathedral tonight,

243
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:57,333
kind of take a whack at the whole 
relationship between God and man conundrum.

244
00:10:57,345 --> 00:10:59,090
But sure, let's go dancing.

245
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,312
Wait, let me just check 
with my friend.

246
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:01,130
Okay.

247
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:03,991
Hey, Marshall. You up for 
some super loud, repetitive music

248
00:11:04,006 --> 00:11:05,963
that hasn't changed 
since the mid-90s?

249
00:11:05,978 --> 00:11:08,613
Um... only always.

250
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:10,542
Let's go.

251
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:14,280
Dancing? 
He went dancing with this girl?

252
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,460
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

253
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:19,133
Dancing is bad. 
Dancing leads to sex.

254
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,423
Did you grow up 
in that Footloose town?

255
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,850
I'm calling him. 
I'm telling him that I was wrong

256
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:27,282
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to 
listen to his stupid stories.

257
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:31,312
Yeah, think of another way 
to phrase that and you'll be fine.

258
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:34,222
He's not answering.

259
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,231
Calling Marshall.

260
00:11:38,657 --> 00:11:39,551
Hello.

261
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:42,283
Marshall, hi, it's Robin. 
Can I talk to Ted?

262
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:44,070
Oh, Robin, hi.

263
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:48,050
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. 
He's, uh... he's working.

264
00:11:48,065 --> 00:11:51,753
Uh, okay. Bye.

265
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:55,202
Marshall just lied.

266
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,750
Ted's cheating on me.

267
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,472
Excuse me. I'm looking for 
a couple guys who came in here earlier.

268
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:07,221
One's about six-four, 210, 
sandy brown hair.

269
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,572
And the other's a cheating bastard.

270
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,493
You're going to need 
to refresh my memory.

271
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:15,913
Okay, fella, baby knows 
how this game's played.

272
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:18,550
How's a $20 help your memory?

273
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,342
Thanks,  but seriously, 
it was crazy tonight.

274
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:24,013
You really do need 
to refresh my memory.

275
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,772
Then can I have the...?

276
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,510
That's cool. You keep that.

277
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:29,951
So these guys-- 
one of them's an architect.

278
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,411
Ted Mosby, the architect?

279
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:32,503
That's the one.

280
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,762
Oh, yeah, he was here.

281
00:12:35,527 --> 00:12:38,691
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry. 
You're on your own this time."

282
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:42,571
And that, my dear, 
was the end of that hack's career.

283
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:45,110
I live across the street.

284
00:12:45,128 --> 00:12:47,323
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

285
00:12:47,338 --> 00:12:48,732
You want to come over?

286
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:51,030
Well, I don't know.

287
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:53,530
But I suppose I should at least 
give you a ride home.

288
00:12:53,545 --> 00:12:55,023
Hop on.

289
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,913
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

290
00:12:56,927 --> 00:12:59,550
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.

291
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:02,950
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

292
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,431
Galloping.

293
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:08,222
You proved it, all right? The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect things works.

294
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:10,440
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

295
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:12,340
Aren't you a little worried 
that a certain somebody

296
00:13:12,357 --> 00:13:14,331
might find out that 
you're doing this?

297
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:15,672
This isn't you, Ted.

298
00:13:15,685 --> 00:13:17,550
It is tonight.

299
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:19,322
Whoo!

300
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:24,040
You know this girl. 
Where does she live?

301
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:26,750
I'm not telling you that 
for less than 20 bucks.

302
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:29,061
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.

303
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:30,550
I'll take your purse.

304
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:31,463
My purse?

305
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,721
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

306
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:36,872
Okay, fine.

307
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,162
You should tell her that looks 
really good with a chocolate boot.

308
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,283
Bitch is lucky I brought 
my small purse.

309
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,642
No room for my gun. Here.

310
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,953
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

311
00:13:48,966 --> 00:13:52,442
The building with the green light, 
apartment 3-C.

312
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,990
Oh, my God, Robin,

313
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:56,672
are you going to kick 
this girl's ass?

314
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:58,070
Yeah...

315
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,321
and steal her purse.

316
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:05,123
I can't believe 
he's cheating on me.

317
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:06,452
You know how many times 
I could have cheated?

318
00:14:06,466 --> 00:14:08,010
Six... no seven.

319
00:14:08,027 --> 00:14:10,591
And you know two of them, 
and they would surprise you.

320
00:14:10,977 --> 00:14:13,031
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

321
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,572
Should I just kick the door in?

322
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,762
Those are really nice heels 
and you already lost the purse.

323
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,691
Let's see if it's unlocked.

324
00:14:19,578 --> 00:14:21,442
It's unlocked.

325
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:25,433
Okay, get in there 
and kick some spankable ass.

326
00:14:27,427 --> 00:14:29,202
Robin.

327
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:32,021
- I'm the problem.
- What?

328
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,360
You were right.

329
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,753
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

330
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,530
I took the nicest guy in the world

331
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,310
and I made him a cheater.

332
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,923
Well, don't stand out here 
and beat yourself up.

333
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:42,671
Get in there and beat Ted up.

334
00:14:42,686 --> 00:14:45,012
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

335
00:14:45,027 --> 00:14:47,211
Actually, I'll take Ted.

336
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,202
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.

337
00:15:10,865 --> 00:15:12,553
What do you think you're...?

338
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,490
Barney?

339
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:17,491
Thank God you're here. 
Can you help with this? I need nails.

340
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:21,451
Okay, I'm totally lost here. 
Where's Ted?

341
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:23,330
Ted? He's at work.

342
00:15:23,345 --> 00:15:25,230
How did you get here?

343
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,503
Awesome story. As per usual.

344
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:31,542
How do you think Mr. Brady 
scored a babe like Carol?

345
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:32,892
Solid point.

346
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:35,812
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.

347
00:15:35,828 --> 00:15:37,923
Sorry, I forgot my binocs 
for Foxy Boxing.

348
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,171
Whoo, looks like things just got 
a little foxier right here.

349
00:15:41,188 --> 00:15:42,843
Yes, they did. 
And you're just in time.

350
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,843
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you 
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

351
00:15:46,856 --> 00:15:49,842
Don't go. We don't even know your name 
to look out for your buildings.

352
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,920
Yeah, stay.

353
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:54,902
Excuse us for one second.

354
00:15:55,686 --> 00:15:58,911
Okay, you were right-- 
the architect thing totally works.

355
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:01,681
But I've got a girlfriend 
and I've got to get back to work.

356
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:04,340
This project is getting 
harder and harder.

357
00:16:04,357 --> 00:16:06,472
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.

358
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,730
See ya.

359
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:12,381
Sorry, my, uh... 
intern had to leave.

360
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,271
Oh, well, that's too bad.

361
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:16,372
I'm Anna, by the way.

362
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:21,290
Ted Mosby... architect.

363
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:25,482
But none of that acclaim means 
anything compared to the joy

364
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:29,040
of seeing the sun rise 
over your first building.

365
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,821
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.

366
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:38,301
All right, you proved it. The whole 
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

367
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:40,533
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

368
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:43,683
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody 
might find out about this?

369
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,733
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

370
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,771
It is tonight.

371
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:50,671
And that led to a couple of hours

372
00:16:50,688 --> 00:16:54,642
that I cannot, as a gentleman, 
divulge to you.

373
00:16:54,658 --> 00:16:57,593
We did it right here, 
and here and here.

374
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:01,693
But why would you use 
Ted's name?

375
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:04,061
I've had some recent bad press 
on the World Wide Web.

376
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:07,962
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole 
"using my real name" thing.

377
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:12,353
Oh, this is great. 
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

378
00:17:12,368 --> 00:17:14,323
Everything isn't okay.

379
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:18,692
Look at me. I'm acting crazy 
and jealous and paranoid.

380
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:21,482
This is how people act 
in relationships.

381
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:24,362
And that's why 
I avoid relationships.

382
00:17:24,948 --> 00:17:26,213
Well, guess what,

383
00:17:26,227 --> 00:17:29,431
I haven't been crazy or jealous 
or paranoid in months,

384
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:32,731
and I really miss it.

385
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,710
And thus ended this chapter of, 
"Let's pour our hearts out

386
00:17:35,726 --> 00:17:38,030
in the bedroom of Barney's 
one-night stand."

387
00:17:38,045 --> 00:17:40,010
Come on, let's go before 
she gets out of the shower.

388
00:17:40,027 --> 00:17:42,540
You're such a pig. 
You're not even going to say good-bye?

389
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,251
I'll have you know 
I composed a lovely form letter

390
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:48,682
for use in just such an occasion.

391
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:51,840
Just fill out her name and then...

392
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:54,763
Something  with a "A."

393
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:57,432
A... A...

394
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll just put "resident."

395
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,693
Go, go, go, go.

396
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,780
Robin took a long walk that night.

397
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,481
She thought about how opening 
yourself up to another person

398
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:18,843
usually means opening yourself up 
to going a little crazy.

399
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:22,653
She thought about how much easier 
it was just to be alone.

400
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,521
And then she came to see me.

401
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:29,991
# And I am nothing of a builder #

402
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,953
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.

403
00:18:35,376 --> 00:18:36,723
Hey.

404
00:18:36,978 --> 00:18:39,692
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.

405
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:42,480
And I don't want to brag, 
but they're filled with jelly.

406
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,452
Thanks.

407
00:18:46,895 --> 00:18:49,773
So, uh... how was your night?

408
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:53,032
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

409
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,462
How was yours?

410
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,291
You really want to hear about 
boring architect stuff?

411
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:01,303
Yes, I do.

412
00:19:01,615 --> 00:19:04,093
I'm sorry about earlier.

413
00:19:04,547 --> 00:19:07,232
To tell you the truth, I never 
even saw all of Field of Dreams.

414
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:09,662
I fell asleep half way through.

415
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:11,873
What? The best part's 
the last 20 minutes.

416
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:14,550
Well, maybe they should have moved that 
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

417
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,620
You know what, um...

418
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,583
What I'm trying to say is...

419
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:22,922
I love being the person 
you bitch to.

420
00:19:23,908 --> 00:19:28,030
So how was your day, 
Mr. Architect?

421
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:30,501
Oh, I like the way 
you say that.

422
00:19:31,298 --> 00:19:33,332
Hey, you want to see 
the building

423
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:35,560
that will make every man 
in Spokane feel inadequate?

424
00:19:35,578 --> 00:19:37,260
Obviously.

425
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:39,961
- Wow.
- Yeah.

426
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,253
You know, you didn't mention 
all the foliage around the base.

427
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,141
If you trim that back, 
the rest would look bigger.

428
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:46,370
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:19:47,856 --> 00:19:51,632
And, um... just for fun, I've...

430
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:55,511
I've sort of been working on my own idea 
of what I think the building should be.

431
00:19:59,928 --> 00:20:01,801
What do you think?

432
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:06,590
You know that time we went to Spokane 
and I pointed out that skyscraper?

433
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:09,381
That was the first building 
I ever designed.

434
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:13,901
And that night was the first time 
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

435
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,920
Wow.

436
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:18,851
Ted, this is amazing.

437
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:20,781
Thanks.

438
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,730
It's not like it will ever 
come to anything.

439
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:26,501
I don't know.

440
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,962
It might come to something.

441
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:34,133
You know, girls find 
architects very hot.

442
00:20:37,786 --> 00:20:39,752
Okay,

443
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:44,162
but I don't want you expecting 
78 stories or anything.

444
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:52,641
"Dear Resident...

445
00:20:52,657 --> 00:20:55,571
The time we spent together, 
however long it was,

446
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,443
meant the world to me.

447
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:00,372
I would love to see you again, 
but unfortunately, I cannot.

448
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:03,861
You see, I am a ghost.

449
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:06,780
I can't only materialize 
once every decade

450
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:09,300
on the anniversary of my death.

451
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:12,452
I chose to spend my one day among 
the living with you,

452
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:14,512
sweet... Resident.

453
00:21:14,526 --> 00:21:17,430
Perhaps we will meet again 
in another decade,

454
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:19,751
provided you keep your figure.

455
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:23,293
Until then, all my love 
from the beyond.

456
00:21:23,305 --> 00:21:25,020
Barney."

457
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,630
Barney?

458
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:31,340
Who the hell is Barney?

459
