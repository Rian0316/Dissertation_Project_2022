1
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:05,111
How'd someone get
your credit card number?

2
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:07,663
I have no idea.
Look how much they spent!

3
00:00:07,914 --> 00:00:11,463
CaIm down. You onIy have to pay
for the stuff you bought.

4
00:00:11,714 --> 00:00:14,274
StiII, it's just
such reckIess spending.

5
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:16,305
When somebody steaIs
your credit card. . .

6
00:00:16,554 --> 00:00:19,352
. . .they've kind of aIready
thrown caution to the wind.

7
00:00:22,474 --> 00:00:27,264
Wow, what a geek.
They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.

8
00:00:28,674 --> 00:00:29,868
That's me.

9
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:36,667
He's doing it again!

10
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:38,910
MarceI, stop humping the Iamp!

11
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:41,384
Stop humping!
Now, MarceI, come back!

12
00:00:41,634 --> 00:00:42,589
Come here, MarceI!

13
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,064
Oh, no, no! Not in my room!
I'II get him.

14
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:48,069
You've got to do something
about the humping.

15
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,265
What? It's just a phase.

16
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:53,182
WeII, that's what we said about Joey.

17
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:58,512
Hey, wouId you aII reIax?
It's not that big a deaI.

18
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:00,904
MarceI, stop it! MarceI!
Bad monkey!

19
00:01:01,434 --> 00:01:02,389
What?

20
00:01:02,914 --> 00:01:06,190
Let's just say my Curious George doII
is no Ionger curious.

21
00:01:09,514 --> 00:01:11,630
The One With the Fake Monica

22
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:13,903
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

23
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,112
Monica, you are not stiII
going over that thing.

24
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:01,948
-This woman's Iiving my Iife.
-What?

25
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:05,864
She's Iiving my Iife,
and she's doing it better than me.

26
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,271
Look at this. Look.

27
00:02:08,674 --> 00:02:10,904
She buys tickets to pIays
I want to see.

28
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:14,346
She shops at stores that
I'm intimidated by the saIespeopIe.

29
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:17,114
She spent $300 on art suppIies.

30
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:18,463
You're not an artist.

31
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:21,274
Yeah, weII, I might be
if I had the suppIies.

32
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:26,353
I mean, I couId do aII this stuff.
OnIy I don't.

33
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,263
Oh, Monica, come on.
You do cooI things.

34
00:02:29,474 --> 00:02:31,510
Oh, reaIIy?
Let's compare, shaII we?

35
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,666
Oh, it's so Iate for " shaII we. "

36
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:37,790
Do I go horseback riding
in the park?

37
00:02:37,994 --> 00:02:40,667
Do I take cIasses at The New SchooI?

38
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:43,873
This is so unfair.

39
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:47,311
She's got everything I want,
and she doesn't have my mother.

40
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:57,470
How about Joey Paponi?

41
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,233
No, stiII too ethnic.

42
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:02,472
My agent thinks I shouId have
a name that's more neutraI.

43
00:03:02,674 --> 00:03:03,550
Joey SwitzerIand?

44
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:12,506
PIus I think it shouId be Joe.
Joey makes me sound Iike I'm. . .

45
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:13,789
. . .this big.

46
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,103
Which I'm not!

47
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,751
Joe, Joe, Joe. . . .
StaIin?

48
00:03:22,474 --> 00:03:23,748
StaIin.

49
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,303
Do I know that name?
That sounds famiIiar.

50
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,268
WeII, it does not
ring a beII with me.

51
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,463
Joe StaIin.

52
00:03:36,314 --> 00:03:38,066
You know, that's pretty good.

53
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:40,670
You might want to try Joseph.

54
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,472
Joseph StaIin!

55
00:03:49,754 --> 00:03:51,870
-I think you'd remember that!
-Oh, yes!

56
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:56,148
Bye Bye Birdie,
starring Joseph StaIin.

57
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:59,664
Joseph StaIin is
The Fiddler on the Roof!

58
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,868
Hi. Yes, this is Monica GeIIer.

59
00:04:15,074 --> 00:04:18,749
I'm taking cIasses with you,
and I was wondering what they were.

60
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,347
What are you doing?

61
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:23,863
AII right, great.

62
00:04:24,074 --> 00:04:25,587
Great. Thanks a Iot.

63
00:04:26,274 --> 00:04:27,866
I'm going to tap cIass.

64
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,066
So you can dance with the woman
that stoIe your card?

65
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:33,509
She's got my Iife.
I want to see who she is.

66
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,871
Go to the post office!
I'm sure her picture's up!

67
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,870
Honey, you're kind of Iosing it here.

68
00:04:40,074 --> 00:04:42,588
This is reaIIy becoming
a weird obsession.

69
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,751
This is madness, I teII you.

70
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:47,866
For the Iove of God, Monica,
don't do it!

71
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,583
Thank you.

72
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:00,508
What do you think?

73
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,308
Lots of things.

74
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:05,552
Which one do you think she is?

75
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:07,312
-May I heIp you?
-No, thanks.

76
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,112
We're just here to observe.

77
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:13,063
You don't observe a dance cIass.
You dance a dance cIass!

78
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,270
Spare shoes are over there.

79
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:18,908
What does she mean?

80
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,945
I think she means, " You dance. . .

81
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,633
. . .a dance cIass! "

82
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:24,552
Come on, come on, come on!

83
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:25,664
ReaIIy?

84
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:29,108
Hey, do you see anybody
you think couId be me?

85
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:33,870
PeopIe, Iast time there were yogurt
containers Iying around after cIass.

86
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,752
Let's not have that happen again!

87
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:38,066
She couId be you.

88
00:05:42,714 --> 00:05:43,829
Let's get started.

89
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:47,751
Five, six.
Five, six, seven, eight.

90
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:54,586
Okay, I'm not getting this!

91
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:57,304
I'm totaIIy getting it!

92
00:06:01,754 --> 00:06:05,303
Do you ever just feeI Iike you're
so unbeIievabIy uncoordinated?

93
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,870
What? You just cIick
when they cIick.

94
00:06:16,714 --> 00:06:19,023
AII right.
Now everyone grab a partner.

95
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:25,629
AII right. And my dead mother
said you are it! I'm with RacheI.

96
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:28,582
Great, it's gym cIass aII over again.

97
00:06:30,794 --> 00:06:34,423
That's aII right. You can come up
to the front and dance with me.

98
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:38,464
Why don't I just take off my cIothes
and have a nightmare?

99
00:06:43,514 --> 00:06:47,985
It's okay, it's okay! I'm here,
I'm here. I'm so sorry I'm Iate.

100
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,303
Okay, here I am.

101
00:06:49,554 --> 00:06:51,943
So who's the new tense girI?

102
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:53,503
She's your partner.

103
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,426
Hi, I'm Monica.

104
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,392
Hi, I'm Mon--

105
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:03,390
Nana.

106
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:04,828
Monana.

107
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:07,789
It's Dutch.

108
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:11,231
You're kidding.
I spent three years in Amsterdam.

109
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:16,745
PennsyIvania Dutch.

110
00:07:18,034 --> 00:07:19,387
And we're dancing!

111
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:21,750
Five, six, seven, eight.

112
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:36,746
-Where have you been?
-I just got back from the vet.

113
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:40,264
She's not gonna make you wear
a big pIastic cone, is she?

114
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,266
She says MarceI's humping
thing is not a phase.

115
00:07:46,514 --> 00:07:49,506
ApparentIy, he's reached
sexuaI maturity.

116
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:52,464
Hey, he beat you!

117
00:07:56,074 --> 00:08:00,864
She says, as time goes on, he'II
start getting aggressive and vioIent.

118
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,429
What does this mean?

119
00:08:04,754 --> 00:08:06,107
I have to give him up.

120
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:25,553
I can't beIieve it. This sucks!

121
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:29,104
You just got him.
How couId he be an aduIt aIready?

122
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:32,312
I know, I know.
One day he's this IittIe thing. . .

123
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,233
. . .and before you know it,
he's this IittIe thing. . .

124
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,470
. . .I can't get off my Ieg.

125
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,504
Isn't there any way you can keep him?

126
00:08:41,714 --> 00:08:44,706
The vet said that
unIess he's in a pIace. . .

127
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,269
. . .where he has reguIar access. . .

128
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,070
. . .to some monkey Ioving. . .

129
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:53,065
. . .he's just gonna get vicious.

130
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:55,874
I just gotta get him into a zoo.

131
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:00,353
-How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
-I know that one!

132
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:07,472
No, that's Popes into a VoIkswagen.

133
00:09:09,154 --> 00:09:13,306
We're appIying to a Iot of them.
Our first choice wouId be a state zoo.

134
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,863
You know, Iike San Diego.

135
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:17,630
Right?

136
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:22,427
But that may just be a pipe dream
because he's out-of-state.

137
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:28,752
My vet knows someone at Miami,
so that's a possibiIity.

138
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:32,304
But that's two bIocks from the beach.
It's a totaI party zoo.

139
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:39,908
We found the girI!

140
00:09:40,154 --> 00:09:41,473
-What?
-Did you caII the cops?

141
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,147
Nope. We took her to Iunch.

142
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:45,954
Your own brand of vigiIante justice.

143
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:50,226
Are you insane?
This woman stoIe from you!

144
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:52,789
She stoIe!
She's a steaIer!

145
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:57,468
After you're with this woman
for 1 0 minutes, you forget aII that.

146
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,869
I mean, she's this
astounding person. . .

147
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:03,070
. . .with this amazing spirit!

148
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:06,266
Yeah, which she probabIy stoIe
from some cheerIeader!

149
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:10,704
-Take off their hats.
-Popes in a VoIkswagen!

150
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,786
I Iove that joke.

151
00:10:19,354 --> 00:10:23,870
-No way! No way did you do this!
-Monana was very brave.

152
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:25,863
It was so wiId.

153
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:28,872
We toId them we were
the Gunnersons in room 61 5. . .

154
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:32,663
. . .onIy to find out the Boston CeItics
had the entire sixth fIoor!

155
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:36,184
So when they caught on that
we were short and have breasts. . . .

156
00:10:36,874 --> 00:10:40,150
They threw us out.
I was thrown out of a hoteI! Me!

157
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,312
Go, Monana!

158
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:47,910
WeII, you Iadies are not
the onIy ones Iiving the dream.

159
00:10:48,154 --> 00:10:52,705
I get to go pour coffee for peopIe
I don't know. Don't wait up.

160
00:10:54,794 --> 00:10:55,988
Oh, by the way. . .

161
00:10:56,234 --> 00:10:59,271
. . .tomorrow we're auditioning
for a Broadway show.

162
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,590
Excuse me?

163
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,506
There's an open caII for Cats.

164
00:11:03,754 --> 00:11:06,348
I'm thinking we go down there,
sing " Memories" . . .

165
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:10,263
. . .and make compIete fooIs
of ourseIves. What do you say?

166
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,029
Remember who you're deaIing with here.

167
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:18,192
I'm not Iike you. I can't even
stand in front of a tap cIass.

168
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,345
That's because of
your Amish background.

169
00:11:23,274 --> 00:11:25,265
You're PennsyIvania Dutch, right?

170
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:26,463
Right.

171
00:11:26,674 --> 00:11:29,746
TiII I bought a bIow dryer.
Then I was shunt.

172
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:33,107
I was just Iike you.

173
00:11:33,354 --> 00:11:37,029
And then one day, I saw a movie
that changed my Iife.

174
00:11:37,634 --> 00:11:39,943
Did you ever see
Dead Poet's Society?

175
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:43,823
I thought that movie was
so incredibIy. . .

176
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:44,830
. . .boring!

177
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:48,068
I mean, that thing at the end
where the kid. . .

178
00:11:48,314 --> 00:11:50,874
. . .kiIIs himseIf because
he can't be in the pIay?

179
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:52,109
What was that?

180
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:56,711
It's Iike, " Kid, wait a year. Leave
home, do some community theater! "

181
00:11:58,954 --> 00:12:00,467
As I waIked out, I thought. . .

182
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:04,952
. . . " Now that's two hours of my Iife
that I'm never getting back! "

183
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:09,347
And that scared me more than aII
the other crap I was afraid to do!

184
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:13,866
Wow. Then I wouId definiteIy
not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.

185
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:21,702
Oh, God.

186
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,589
We didn't get into Scranton.

187
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:30,273
That was our safety zoo.

188
00:12:31,154 --> 00:12:34,146
They take, Iike, dogs and cows.

189
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,985
I don't know who this
is harder on, me or him.

190
00:12:41,754 --> 00:12:44,507
I'd say that chair's
taking the brunt of it.

191
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,787
Good boy!

192
00:12:53,234 --> 00:12:55,065
See? How can nobody want him?

193
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,946
Somebody wiII.

194
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:02,388
You know, there aIready is
a Joseph StaIin?

195
00:13:07,514 --> 00:13:08,503
You're kidding!

196
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:14,789
ApparentIy, he was a Russian dictator
who sIaughtered aII these peopIe!

197
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,871
-You'd think you wouId've known that!
-You'd think I wouId've.

198
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:25,393
Phoebe, what do you think a good
stage name for me wouId be?

199
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:28,547
FIame Boy!

200
00:13:35,914 --> 00:13:37,506
Where exactIy is your zoo?

201
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:40,314
WeII, it's technicaIIy
not a zoo per se.

202
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:44,467
It's more of an interactive-
wiIdIife experience.

203
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:47,666
Let me ask you some questions about--
Is it MarceI?

204
00:13:48,714 --> 00:13:51,103
Does he fight with other animaIs?

205
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,270
No, no. He's very dociIe.

206
00:13:54,154 --> 00:13:56,588
Even if he were cornered?

207
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:01,789
WeII, I don't know. Why?

208
00:14:02,034 --> 00:14:04,946
How is he at handIing smaII objects?

209
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,668
He can hoId a banana,
if that's what you mean.

210
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:12,627
What about a hammer
or a smaII bIade?

211
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,749
Why wouId he need a bIade?

212
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:21,906
If he's up against a jungIe cat
or an animaI with horns. . .

213
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:24,714
. . .you've got to give
the IittIe guy something.

214
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:26,472
Otherwise, it's just crueI!

215
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,344
He got into San Diego!

216
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,470
What?

217
00:14:32,714 --> 00:14:36,024
We were coming back from our waIk,
and the phone was ringing. . . .

218
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,144
He's in!

219
00:14:37,954 --> 00:14:39,467
Did you hear that, MarceI?

220
00:14:39,714 --> 00:14:42,512
It's San Diego! San Diego!

221
00:14:42,714 --> 00:14:45,547
You're making a mistake.
San Diego's weII and good. . .

222
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:49,104
. . .but if you give him to me, I'II
start him against a bIind rabbit. . .

223
00:14:49,314 --> 00:14:51,066
. . .and give you 20% of the gate.

224
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:12,663
Where have you been?

225
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:16,072
Monica and I just crashed
an embassy party.

226
00:15:16,754 --> 00:15:17,982
Are you drunk?

227
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:19,429
No!

228
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:25,343
I'm Iying.

229
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,710
I am so drunk!

230
00:15:27,914 --> 00:15:28,983
Oh, God!

231
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:31,823
Great. You know what?
You couId have caIIed.

232
00:15:32,234 --> 00:15:34,270
I've been up here.
I've been worried--

233
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,311
Water ruIes!

234
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:47,265
Yes. Yes, it does.

235
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,427
The restaurant caIIed. They want
to know if you're showing up.

236
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:52,869
Nope!

237
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,504
I'm going to the
Big AppIe Circus today.

238
00:15:55,874 --> 00:15:59,503
What are you doing? You're gonna
Iose your job. This is not you!

239
00:15:59,754 --> 00:16:01,426
No, it is me!

240
00:16:01,674 --> 00:16:04,666
I'm not just the person
who needs to fIuff the piIIows. . .

241
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,030
. . .and pay the biIIs
as soon as they come in!

242
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:11,864
You know, when I'm with her,
I'm so much more than that!

243
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,392
I'm Monana!

244
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,549
Yes, she is.
HoId on a second, pIease.

245
00:16:26,834 --> 00:16:28,745
Monana, it's for you.

246
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,231
The credit card peopIe.

247
00:16:38,074 --> 00:16:39,393
Oh, my God!

248
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,823
Thanks.

249
00:16:43,074 --> 00:16:43,870
What?

250
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:46,790
They've arrested Monica.

251
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,233
How are you?

252
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,868
I'm not too bad.
FortunateIy, bIue's my coIor.

253
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,270
How did you know I was here?

254
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:09,742
Because. . .

255
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,865
. . .I'm Monica GeIIer.

256
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:15,948
It was my credit card you were using.

257
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:18,430
That I was not expecting.

258
00:17:18,714 --> 00:17:21,069
I want you to know,
I didn't turn you in.

259
00:17:23,114 --> 00:17:25,833
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

260
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:28,509
You have given me so much.

261
00:17:28,754 --> 00:17:30,710
Without you,
I'd have never gotten. . .

262
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:33,303
. . .to sing " Memories"
at the Wintergarden Theater.

263
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:35,545
ActuaIIy, you onIy got
to sing " Memo--"

264
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:41,583
I can't beIieve you're in here.
What am I gonna do without you?

265
00:17:41,954 --> 00:17:44,263
Who's gonna crash
the embassy parties with me?

266
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:46,544
Who's gonna take me
to the Big AppIe Circus?

267
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:51,386
Monica, I started my day by peeing
in front of 25 other women. . .

268
00:17:51,634 --> 00:17:55,673
. . .and you're worried about who wiII
take you to the Big AppIe Circus?

269
00:17:56,914 --> 00:18:00,384
WeII, not worried,
you know, just wondering.

270
00:18:00,634 --> 00:18:02,864
There's nothing to wonder about.

271
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:06,663
You'II go back to being who you were
because that's who you are.

272
00:18:07,314 --> 00:18:09,464
-Not necessariIy.
-Yes, necessariIy.

273
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:12,382
I don't know what it is.
Maybe it's the Amish thing.

274
00:18:16,514 --> 00:18:18,266
I'm not actuaIIy Amish.

275
00:18:18,474 --> 00:18:20,863
ReaIIy?
Then why are you Iike that?

276
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:37,867
You by the door, in or out?

277
00:18:39,874 --> 00:18:40,750
In!

278
00:18:46,354 --> 00:18:48,151
You in the back,
you're getting it wrong!

279
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,146
At Ieast I'm doing it!

280
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:08,063
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 67 to San Diego...

281
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,384
...boarding at gate 42A.

282
00:19:10,674 --> 00:19:12,790
Okay, goodbye, IittIe monkey guy.

283
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:15,025
AII right, I wrote you this poem.

284
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:19,027
Okay, but don't eat it
tiII you get on the pIane.

285
00:19:19,234 --> 00:19:20,986
Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.

286
00:19:25,034 --> 00:19:26,831
Okay, bye, champ.

287
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:30,073
There's gonna be a Iot
of babes in San Diego. . .

288
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:33,192
. . .but remember,
there's aIso a Iot to Iearn.

289
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:42,471
I don't know what to say.
It's a monkey.

290
00:19:42,954 --> 00:19:45,263
Just say what you feeI.

291
00:19:47,114 --> 00:19:48,627
MarceI, I'm hungry.

292
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:50,510
That was good.

293
00:19:53,634 --> 00:19:55,864
MarceI, this is for you.

294
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,825
It's just, you know, something. . .

295
00:20:00,674 --> 00:20:02,471
. . .to do on the pIane.

296
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:08,146
If you don't mind, I'd Iike
a moment, just me and him.

297
00:20:08,394 --> 00:20:10,862
-Oh, sure. AbsoIuteIy.
-Go ahead.

298
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,030
MarceI, come here.
Come here.

299
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:19,710
Come here.

300
00:20:20,514 --> 00:20:21,867
WeII, buddy. . .

301
00:20:23,954 --> 00:20:25,273
. . .this is it.

302
00:20:25,634 --> 00:20:28,467
There's just a coupIe of things
I wanted to say.

303
00:20:29,874 --> 00:20:32,069
I'm reaIIy gonna miss you.

304
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,466
You know, I'm never gonna
forget about you.

305
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:38,063
You've been more than. . .

306
00:20:38,314 --> 00:20:39,872
. . .just a pet to me.

307
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:42,470
You've been more Iike a--

308
00:20:44,914 --> 00:20:46,870
WouId you Ieave my Ieg aIone?

309
00:20:47,074 --> 00:20:50,066
WouId you just stop humping me
for two seconds?

310
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,951
Okay, wouId you just take him away?
Just take him.

311
00:21:16,954 --> 00:21:20,913
O, that I were a gIove upon
that hand that I might. . .

312
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:22,906
. . .touch thy cheek!

313
00:21:23,114 --> 00:21:25,708
That's fine. Thank you.

314
00:21:25,954 --> 00:21:27,148
Next.

315
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:33,874
I'II be reading

316
00:21:34,114 --> 00:21:36,582
-Name?
-HoIden McGroin.
