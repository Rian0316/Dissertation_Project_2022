[Knocking continues]

00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,554
Sir, we'd like to talk with you
for a minute.

6
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:34,322
Could you open the door, please?

7
00:01:36,776 --> 00:01:38,260
Look, we know you're in there.

8
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,909
You're casting a shadow
through your peephole.

9
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:42,611
All we want to do is talk.

10
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:43,995
Would you please open the door?

Tommy: Sir, come on and open up.

14
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,622
[Sighs] I have a condition.

15
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:55,090
Uh, I can't go outside

16
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:57,426
or be exposed to what's out there.

17
00:01:57,461 --> 00:01:59,928
You were able to come outside
to steal your neighbor's newspaper.

18
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:00,962
Chuck: I didn't steal it.

19
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:02,264
I left $5.

20
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:05,016
The... the cover price is 50 cents.

21
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:08,470

to sell you her paper?

L... um, officer, let's... let's...

Let's talk about something
called "probable cause."

27
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:23,235
As I'm sure you know,
in the state of New Mexico,

28
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,569
there is a two-part test

29
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:26,238
to determine whether police officers

30
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,957
have an objectively reasonable basis...

33

as I pointed out, uh, creates an event...

34
00:02:55,853 --> 00:02:58,603
Hey, Tommy. Come around here, would you?

35
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:01,740
And that's why the
10th circuit court of appeals

36
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,659
ruled that a coercive order...

37
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:07,162
Check this out.

38
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,371
Requiring an individual
leave his house is seizure...

39
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:19,508
And, therefore,

40
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:23,044

the fourth amendment, right?

41
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,882

44
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:34,356
Is he coming out, or are we going in?

Officer: You got 10 seconds
to open this door,

46
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,785

47

- Ah.
- Final warning!

48
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,455
Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll...
I'll let you in,

Definitely, definitely no tasers.

170

Oh, yeah. In fact,
I... I do so many patent cases,

171
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,106
I should probably just go ahead
and specialize already.

172
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:38,442

00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,599
This one has this little unit I've added.

184
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:20,017
This is my invention.

185
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,435
Do you have children?

186
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:22,819
No.

187
00:11:22,855 --> 00:11:24,521
My wife and I have two boys... 4 and 6.

188
00:11:24,523 --> 00:11:26,690
And let me tell you...
Toilet-training them?

189
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,492
Nightmare, both times.

190
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,723
They just didn't want to use the commode.

191
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,975
So I wired a motion sensor to a voice chip,

192
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,178
and, well, no sense getting all technical,

193
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,181
but it's all about positive reinforcement.

194
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,349
Meet Tony the toilet buddy.

195
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,102
And when you sit down to do your business,

196
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:45,354
this is how he works.

197
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,493

198
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,447

200
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:59,502
<i>Gosh, you're big!</i>

201
00:11:59,537 --> 00:12:02,538
<i>You're so big!</i>

202
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,090
<i>My goodness!</i>

203
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,708
<i>Look at you!</i>

204
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,212
[Clanks]

205
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,464
<i>Fill me up, Chandler!</i>

206
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,799
<i>Put it in me!</i>

207
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:14,467
Chandler's my youngest... loves it.

208
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:16,135
Huh.

209
00:12:16,137 --> 00:12:17,603
[Clanks]

210
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,606
<i>Give it to me, Chandler! I want it all!</i>

211
00:12:20,642 --> 00:12:22,441
<i>Mmm!</i>

212
00:12:22,477 --> 00:12:24,227
<i>Ahhh!</i>

213
00:12:26,314 --> 00:12:28,114
Anyway, it goes on from there.

214
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:29,315
You get the picture.

215
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,818
Yeah, I, uh...

216
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,404
Yeah.

217
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:38,124
So, what do you think?

218
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:44,580
It's a little sexual, maybe?

219
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:46,582
Sexual? What... what does that...

220
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:47,834
Suggestive, maybe...

221
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:50,803
Maybe that's a better word. [Chuckles]

222
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,255
Look, I'm not...

223
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,840
I'm not saying
this thing won't make you rich.

224
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:56,843
I mean, some of your wealthier
pacific rim nations...

225
00:12:56,845 --> 00:12:59,512
They'll love this... the crazy bastards.

226

[Chuckles]

227
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:04,317
I created this for children...
Children, understand?

228
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:05,985
Well, hey,

229
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,772
Viagra was originally invented
to treat hypertension.

230
00:13:09,824 --> 00:13:11,824
Look how that turned out.

231
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:16,495
You're completely disgusting,
you know that?!

232
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,664
Hey, buddy, you're the one
with the sex toilet.

233
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,866
Get off my property!

234
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:21,000
Hey, you know what?

235
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,835
I hope you do make a fortune,

236
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:26,172
'cause Chandler's gonna need it
to help pay for his therapy!

237

No, no. You just stay put.

249
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,523
I'll be right over.

250
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:36,108

[Breathes deeply]

255
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,652
Now, where were we?

256
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,370
Oh, would you like some more tea?

257
00:15:21,406 --> 00:15:24,040
No! No, thank you. I'm... I'm fine.

258
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:26,075
Now, the Shepherd boy Hummel...

259
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,577
That's gonna go to your nephew Clarence?

260
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,830
As long as he finishes college. Okay.

261
00:15:30,832 --> 00:15:33,249
If he drops out,
it goes to my niece Raylene.

262
00:15:33,301 --> 00:15:35,468
But then, Raylene doesn't get the girl...

263
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:37,086
The girl with the geese. Mm.

264
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:39,005
Yeah. No, then that would go
to your cousin Helen...

265
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,339
Mm-hmm.

266
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:43,392
So long as she never remarries Frederick?

267
00:15:43,428 --> 00:15:44,927
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

268
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:48,681
And no matter what,
I want the towheaded twins

269
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,017
to go to Reverend Lawrence's grandson.

270
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:53,319
Um, don't you mean Reverend Hanes?

271
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:56,188
'Cause Reverend<i> Lawrence's</i>
grandson is going to get

272
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,409
the, uh, lute-playing angel,
'cause he was in the choir.

273
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:03,863
Very sharp, Mr. McGill.

274
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:06,665
And here I thought all lawyers were idiots.

275
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,584
[Chuckles] No, only half of us are idiots.

276
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:09,869
The other half are crooks.

- Well...

If I were 40 years younger,

280
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,211
I'd have you buy me a piña colada.

281
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:21,180
Well, if you want me to draw up a DNR,

282
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:24,016
I'll bring a blender and some pineapple.

283
00:16:24,052 --> 00:16:26,052
[Both laugh] I knew I'd like you

284

that poor man on the television.

Now, I hate to do this,

290

but I do need to bring up my payment.

291
00:16:41,903 --> 00:16:44,036
Um [Clears throat] and I'm sorry,

292
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,322

$140?

I'll gladly accept $70 today

297

if your toes are too small.

311
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,225
They should all be the same size...

00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:15,918
[Buzzing intensifies]

364
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,401
Jimmy: Chuck.

365
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:18,566
Chuck, you with me?

366
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:20,435
Chuck, hey, buddy. It's me.

367
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,084
Hey, can you talk to me? Jim...

368
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:26,387
Jesus Christ. These sons of bitches.

369
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:27,639
[Breathing sharply]

370
00:20:27,674 --> 00:20:29,924
Hey, hey. Sir, you can't do that.

371
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:32,810
- All of this needs to stay on.
- No, no. No electricity.

372
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:35,297
- You understand?
- No, it needs to be on.

373
00:20:35,345 --> 00:20:37,098
- I'm getting security.
- No, uh, wait, wait.

374
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,516
Wait, wait. Uh, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

375
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:39,918
Jimmy: Huh? Why isn't that one going out?

376
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:42,437
- Jimmy. Jimmy.
- Damn it.

377
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:45,273
I just... Jimmy, wait a second.
Jimmy. Think.

378
00:20:45,325 --> 00:20:49,110
- What's the plan here?
- Sir? Sir?

379
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:50,995
Sir, I need you to get down from there.

380
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,947
What the hell kind of torture
chamber you running here?

381
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:54,782
He... he's allergic
to electricity, all right?

382
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,201
- You heard the doc. Get down now.
- No, all these lights and machines...

383
00:20:57,203 --> 00:20:58,536
You might as well throw him
into a microwave.

384
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,871
- Come on down now.
- No, don't touch me!

385
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:03,174
He is this patient's brother.
Please, listen to him.

386
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:04,676
[Remote control beeps]

387
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,878
[Breathing heavily]

388
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,097
- Let's go.
- Dr. Cruz: Hey. Wait, Edwin, hold up.

389
00:21:09,132 --> 00:21:10,431
Hold on a second, Edwin.

390
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:12,801
Sir, are you ready to calm down now?

391
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,429
Yes. His name is Jimmy, and,
yes, he is gonna calm down.

392
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,762
I need you to say the words, Jimmy.

393
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,430
I need to hear it from you.

394
00:21:18,465 --> 00:21:20,048
I'm calm, okay? I'm calm.

395
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:23,468
Edwin, why don't you
go wait in the hallway?

396
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,938
I'll call if we need you.

397
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:30,192
Okay, so, tell me about the electricity.

398
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:33,529
Yeah, look, I know how
it sounds, but it's real.

399
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:35,147
Oh, shit.

400
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,567
My phone and stuff...
Anything with a battery in it...

401
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:40,285
He can't have it near him.

402
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,538
Hang on.

403
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,073
Here's my phone. Okay, that's it.

404
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:48,126
[Breathing heavily] Thanks.

405
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,750
Okay, what the hell happened to him?

406
00:21:54,802 --> 00:21:56,585
- Why is he here?
- Apparently, it started

407
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:58,670
when Charles stole
his neighbor's newspaper.

408
00:21:58,672 --> 00:22:00,756
What? He... he never leaves the house.

409
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,474
I don't... I don't have all the details,

410
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:04,560
but the police found him
in a very agitated state.

411
00:22:04,595 --> 00:22:07,479
He was confrontational and incoherent.

412
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:08,814
How come you didn't call me?

413
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,566
Uh, why did I have to hear about this

414
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:13,602
through my brother's
prick of a law partner?

415
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,153
The only contact information we could find

416
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:17,155
was a business card.

417
00:22:17,191 --> 00:22:21,193
Jimmy, in my opinion,
Charles should be committed

418
00:22:21,195 --> 00:22:24,696
for 30 days of psychiatric observation.

419
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,164
As a family member,

420
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,034
you can submit a petition
for him to be evaluated.

421
00:22:29,036 --> 00:22:31,536
There's an excellent facility
in Las Cruces.

422
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:34,840
He can be there tomorrow.

423
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:36,959
I'd rather not. [Breathes deeply]

424
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:39,962
Hey, buddy. Hey, I'm right here.

425
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:41,013
Oh, hey, Chuck.

426
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:42,931
Excuse me.

427
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:45,601
Mr. McGill, my name is Dr. Cruz.

428
00:22:45,636 --> 00:22:47,302
Do you know why you're in the hospital?

429
00:22:47,354 --> 00:22:52,808
The police kicked in my door...
No warrant, no cause.

430
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,142
I wasn't incoherent.

431
00:22:54,194 --> 00:22:55,811
They just weren't listening.

432
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:58,063
They tasered me, Jimmy.

433
00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,615
Aw, Jesus.

434
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,067
Kim?

435
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,236
I'm sorry. I can give you privacy.

436
00:23:04,238 --> 00:23:06,405
Oh, no, no, no. That's all right. Stay.

437
00:23:06,407 --> 00:23:08,123
Howard... Called me.

438
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,908
He's very concerned about you.

439
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,494
How are you feeling now, Mr. McGill?

440
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:15,414
Uh, do... do you have a phone
or a... a pager,

441
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,082
anything with a battery?

442
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:19,751
I don't think so. I...

443
00:23:21,588 --> 00:23:23,255
Uh...

444
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:26,141
Yeah. [Chuckles]

445
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:28,260
- [Breathing quickly]
- Oversight. Sorry about that.

446
00:23:30,564 --> 00:23:34,316
Can you tell me a little more
about your... Situation?

447
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:36,518
It's not a situation.

448
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,570
It's a condition...

449
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:40,856
Electromagnetic hypersensitivity.

450
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:44,526
For reasons unknown, my nervous
system has become sensitized

451
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:47,746
to certain frequencies
of electromagnetic radiation.

452
00:23:47,781 --> 00:23:50,415
Your brother called it
an allergy to electricity.

453
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:52,334
Well, it's an oversimplification,

454
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,920
but it's essentially correct.

455
00:23:54,955 --> 00:24:00,693
Electronic devices create their
own electromagnetic fields.

456
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:05,097
The closer I am to such devices,
the worse my symptoms.

457
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:06,548
Which are?

458
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,051
Burning sensation on my skin,

459
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:12,137
a sharp, cold pain in my bones,

460
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:15,190
muscle fatigue, heart palpitations,

461
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:17,526
blurred vision, tinnitus,

462
00:24:17,561 --> 00:24:20,862
vertigo, nausea, shortness of breath,

463
00:24:20,898 --> 00:24:23,115
a general... it hurts.

464
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,900
Yes, it hurts.

465
00:24:24,952 --> 00:24:27,652
When did you first experience
these symptoms?

466
00:24:27,654 --> 00:24:29,905
[Sighs] Oh, it must have been...

467
00:24:29,957 --> 00:24:33,408
Y... you left the office 18 months ago.

468
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:37,162
Huh. Well, in that case, uh,
must have been almost two years.

469
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:38,880
- Two years?
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:24:38,916 --> 00:24:41,583
That's a... that's a long time
to live with discomfort.

471
00:24:41,635 --> 00:24:42,834
Oh, there it is.

472
00:24:44,505 --> 00:24:47,005
You think I'm crazy.

473
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,141
I never said that.

474
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,309
No, you didn't, because you're very polite,

475
00:24:51,345 --> 00:24:52,928
but you think it.

476
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,313
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
talking about commitment.

477
00:24:55,349 --> 00:24:57,099
You find that idea distressing.

478
00:24:57,151 --> 00:24:58,600
Who the hell wouldn't?

479
00:24:58,652 --> 00:25:01,153
I... I find it inappropriate

480
00:25:01,188 --> 00:25:05,090
for a person suffering from
a physical condition.

481
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,159
[Breathes deeply]

482
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:09,528
Anyone who's spent more than
a few minutes with me

483
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,447
knows that this isn't
some kind of delusion.

484
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:13,698
Wouldn't you agree, Kim?

485
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,500
Jimmy: Of course she does.

486
00:25:15,536 --> 00:25:17,202
Well, I'm not a doctor.

487
00:25:17,204 --> 00:25:19,671
You've known me for
the better part of a decade.

488
00:25:19,706 --> 00:25:21,757
Have you ever seen me exhibit any sign...

489
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,259
Any sign whatsoever of mental illness?

490
00:25:24,294 --> 00:25:25,761
See?

491
00:25:25,796 --> 00:25:27,712
If I thought for one second
you could cure me,

492
00:25:27,714 --> 00:25:30,549
believe me, I'd jump at the chance.

493
00:25:30,551 --> 00:25:31,716
But with all due respect,

494
00:25:31,718 --> 00:25:33,218
psychiatry doesn't have the answers.

495
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,719
I'd very much like to try.

496
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:38,523
Section 43-1-11, part (E)(3)...

497
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,559
"The proposed commitment is consistent with

498
00:25:40,561 --> 00:25:42,644
"the treatment needs of the client

499
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:46,148
and with the least drastic means
principle."

500
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,068
Chuck: Do you think subjecting me
to this kind of pain for a month

501
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,486
is the least drastic means?

502
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:53,572
He might as well spend
a month in a wood chipper.

503
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:59,461
Dr. Cruz: I understand
your frustration. I do.

504
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:02,714
You're obviously a highly intelligent man

505
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:07,085
in difficult circumstances.

506
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:10,388
May I ask you a question,
just for my own interest?

507
00:26:10,424 --> 00:26:13,725
How do you meet the needs of daily life?

508
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,310
What do you do for light, or...

509
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,928
How do you prepare food?

510
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,681
[Sighs] I use white-gas lanterns.

511
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:21,266
For cooking, I have a camp stove.

512
00:26:21,268 --> 00:26:24,069
I have a large cooler
I keep filled with ice.

513
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:28,073
It's not ideal, but I make do.

514
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,357
I see.

515
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:31,693
Well, thank you.

516
00:26:31,745 --> 00:26:33,528
Would you mind if I took a moment

517
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,947
to speak with your brother?

518
00:26:35,949 --> 00:26:38,783
Oh, uh, make sure you still have
your wallet when you're done.

519
00:26:38,785 --> 00:26:41,203
[Chuckles] Funny guy.

520
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,621
Jimmy.

521
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:47,926
[Sighs] I want to go home.

522
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,852
[Intercom chatter]

523
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:58,220
That was a dirty trick.

524
00:26:58,272 --> 00:27:00,605
That wasn't a trick...
It was a demonstration.

525
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:03,058
This allergy to electricity isn't real...

526
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,227
It's a manifestation of something deeper.

527
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,862
I'm not saying it's 100% real, okay?

528
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:09,231
But Chuck is smarter than you
and me put together,

529
00:27:09,283 --> 00:27:11,066
so we're not talking him out of this,

530
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:13,869
and I'm not sending him to a rubber room.

531
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:15,904
No one is talking about rubber rooms.

532
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,038
There are specialists who will...

533
00:27:17,074 --> 00:27:18,290
He's seen specialists, okay?

534
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:19,824
The best doctors from here to Denver,

535
00:27:19,826 --> 00:27:21,293
and none of them helped... not one.

536
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,544
So you're ready to give up.

537
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,713
[Scoffs] Who's giving up, huh?

538
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:27,716
I'm... I'm the one
doing the heavy lifting here.

539
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,301
That white gas he was talking about...

540
00:27:29,336 --> 00:27:30,719
Who do you think brings him that?

541
00:27:30,754 --> 00:27:32,387
And milk and bread and toilet paper

542
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:34,422
and ice and every other
damn thing he needs.

543
00:27:34,474 --> 00:27:38,226
Is that helping or enabling?

544
00:27:38,262 --> 00:27:40,562
If you testify in a custodial hearing,

545
00:27:40,597 --> 00:27:42,898
he can get the help he needs...
That's in your power.

546
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:44,816
To be committed involuntarily,

547
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:46,818
he has to be a danger to himself or others.

548
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:48,320
And he is.

549
00:27:48,355 --> 00:27:51,323
Coleman lanterns indoors, a camp stove?

550
00:27:51,358 --> 00:27:53,024
I mean, he could burn his house down

551
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:55,243
or the entire neighborhood,

552
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,746
and then you're looking at
a commitment of 10 to 20 years.

553
00:27:57,781 --> 00:27:59,281
What if...

554
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:01,366
What if he just hurts himself
in a household accident?

555
00:28:01,368 --> 00:28:03,535
How does he call for help?

556
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:08,506
You have the power to help your brother...

557
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:11,042
Truly help him.

558
00:28:13,297 --> 00:28:15,380
Ignoring this won't make it go away.

559
00:28:20,137 --> 00:28:22,887
What would<i> you</i> do?

560
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,107
All I know is...

561
00:28:26,143 --> 00:28:27,642
He needs help.

564
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,704
I'm getting him out of here.

565
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:44,826
A nurse will bring you the release forms.

567

Oh, boy.

00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:04,095
Jimmy. Jimmy. I found him.

569
00:29:04,097 --> 00:29:06,598
I thought I'd wait till you got here.

570
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,266
Great. How's he doing?

571
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,934
Better. Resting.

572
00:29:09,936 --> 00:29:12,153
Good.

573
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:14,606
Uh, Jimmy...

574
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:16,574
I want you to know
that I've talked to the D.A.,

575
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,245
and he absolutely will not sign
off on any commitment papers.

576
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,497
This is a<i> physical</i> condition,
not a mental one.

577
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:23,915
Chuck is of sound mind.

578
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,034
I think we can all agree on that.

579
00:29:26,086 --> 00:29:27,118
[Scoffs]

580
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,170
You're a real peach, Howard.

581
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:31,339
Of course you don't want Chuck committed.

582
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:33,875
No, I don't. Why would I?

583
00:29:33,927 --> 00:29:35,877
Because if Chuck were committed,

584
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:37,345
then I'd become his legal guardian,

585
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,513
and I cash him out of HHM.

586
00:29:38,548 --> 00:29:40,015
Jesus, Jimmy. Now?

587
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,683
You want to hash that out
while he's lying in here?

588
00:29:41,718 --> 00:29:43,268
You know, the tanning bed
must have melted your brain

589
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:44,602
if you think for one second...

590
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:46,971
Guys... Chuck. That's why we're here.

591
00:29:46,973 --> 00:29:49,224
Yes. Let's stay on point.

592
00:29:49,276 --> 00:29:51,393
We're talking about the well-being of a man

593
00:29:51,445 --> 00:29:52,894
whom we all love very much.

594
00:29:52,946 --> 00:29:54,479
There's many factors at play.

595
00:29:54,481 --> 00:29:55,980
Spite doesn't have to be one of them.

596
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,365
You know what, Howard?

597
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:58,616
I was on the fence till you showed up,

598
00:29:58,652 --> 00:29:59,951
but thanks for helping me decide.

599
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:01,986
Wave bye-bye to your cash cow,

600
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:04,122
'cause it's leaving the pasture.

601
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:05,407
I'm committing him.

602
00:30:09,663 --> 00:30:11,746
Jimmy. Uh, j... wait.

603
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:13,832
Jimmy, wait. Jimmy.

604
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,800
Jimmy, can you wait?

605
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:17,752
Jimmy, wait a second.

606
00:30:17,804 --> 00:30:19,637
Listen, I agree that Chuck needs help,

607
00:30:19,673 --> 00:30:21,473
and maybe it's the right thing to do,

608
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,007
but you can't do it like this.

609
00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:25,844
I just want to see
that son of a bitch sweat.

610
00:30:25,846 --> 00:30:28,813
It's so obvious what he's afraid of.

611
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:31,483
I'm taking my brother home.

- Yeah.
- There you go.

615
00:30:47,989 --> 00:30:50,272
Okay, some steps. One and two.

616
00:30:50,308 --> 00:30:51,640
And there you go.

617
00:30:51,692 --> 00:30:53,976
Hey, you're home, all right?

618
00:30:54,028 --> 00:30:57,279
Everything's gonna be all right.

619
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:59,398
Uh, you want something to eat...

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,734
Uh, some tea... a cup of tea?

00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:04,203
- Coffee?
- [Sighs] Yeah.

00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,539
Coffee. Coffee it is.

I'm gonna need my...

You want to talk about this?

631
00:32:04,048 --> 00:32:06,215
- There's nothing to talk about.
- You took the paper.

632
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:07,466
You saw this.

633
00:32:07,468 --> 00:32:10,686
You got sick.

634
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,388
What's your point?

635
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,059
Chuck, I think you got sick
'cause you saw this story.

636
00:32:17,111 --> 00:32:20,312
No, w... whenever you think
I've done something wrong,

637
00:32:20,314 --> 00:32:23,065
something questionable, you get worse.

638
00:32:23,117 --> 00:32:24,400
I didn't get sick

639
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:25,734
because I read about you in the paper.

640
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,236
I got sick

641
00:32:27,288 --> 00:32:29,788
because I went out of my house
to retrieve the paper.

I'm too tired for this argument, Jimmy.

644

I... I've had it too many times.

645
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,581
You think this is the return
of slippin' Jimmy,

646
00:32:38,633 --> 00:32:41,050
but it's not. All right.

647
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:44,920
Uh, you think the
billboard thing was unethical,

648
00:32:44,972 --> 00:32:47,006
but it was... Promotion.

649
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,807
It was advertising... that's all.

650
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:51,477
Which wasn't even allowed until
five supreme court justices

651
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:54,263
went completely bonkers in
Bates vs. State bar of Arizona.

652
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:55,731
Aha!

653
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,816
But in any event...

654
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:59,235
It's legal.

655
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,520
If you want to advertise,
that's your business.

656
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:04,156
"Business" being
the operative word there, Chuck,

657
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,525
because I-I<i> have</i> gotten business
off of this...

to specialize in elder law.

Yeah, the things the elderly
have to deal with...

662
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,956

coming after their savings,

663
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:23,592

664
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,594

Well, that sounds...

668
00:33:33,688 --> 00:33:35,387
Promising.

669
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,223
But it has nothing to do with my condition.

670
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,859
Chuck, listen. I'm gonna make
you a promise right now, okay?

671
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,910
- No, not necessary, not requested.
- Okay.

672
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,878

I... I'm a good lawyer.

674
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:50,298
