麦克斯  我知道新时间表该怎么排了
Okay, Max, I figured out our new schedule.

31
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,720
我也才知道我们用的便宜牙膏
And I figured out the cheap toothpaste

32
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,930
其实是放尿布疹软膏
we've been using is really diaper cream.

33
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,760
但好歹我牙龈上的尿布疹都消了
On the plus side, that rash cleared up on my gums.

34
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,330
晚上6点到清晨2点在餐厅上班

And then pastry school from 12:00 to 4:00.

38
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,220
-有忘了什么吗  -拉屎跟睡觉时间
- Forget anything? - Just poopin' and sleepin'.

39
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,820
现在我得去重安排时间表了
Now, I have to go rewrite the schedule.

40
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,950
来吧  麦克斯  明天是你的超超大日子
Let's go, Max, you have a huge, huge day tomorrow.

41
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,670
第一天上烘焙学校
First day of pastry school.

42
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,140
别说"超超大"了
Stop saying it's huge.

43
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,490
每次以为要看到"超大东西"时
Whenever I think something's gonna be huge,

44
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,010
最后都只看到"大巨蛋"
It just turns out to be all balls.

45
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,240
我花钱干洗了我的衬衫
I splurged and had my blouse cleaned.

46
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,820
这干洗袋让我想起了当有钱人的时光
Dry cleaning bags remind me of when I had money.

47
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,610
那袋子只让我回想起
Really? They remind me of

48
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,750
我妈曾想把我闷死
when my mother tried to suffocate me.

49
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,160
据说而已啦  走吧
Allegedly. Let's go.

50
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,290
等等  麦克斯  你还不能走
Wait, wait. Max, you can't go yet.

51
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:07,320
我需要你留下来帮忙一件事
I need you to stay and help with something.

52
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,850
阿憨  我都教过你了  
Han, I told you-- it's bend and wipe,

53
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,940
弯下身擦屁股  裤子拉上穿穿好
then up come your big boy pants.

54
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
阿憨说得对  你不能走
Yeah, Han's right. You can't go.

55
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,700
再待一会吧
Stay here a few more minutes.

56
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,600
为啥
Why?

57
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,700
我们要开麦克斯的批斗大会吗
Are we having an intervention for Max?

58
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,570
大家安安
Hey, everybody.

59
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,200
我还没错过"欢庆麦克斯

61
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,370
苏菲  我们都还没给她惊喜呢
Sophie, we hadn't surprised her yet.

62
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,880
她站在这都听见啦
Oh, but she's right there.

63
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,120
惊喜都被你剧透光了  阿憨
You just blew it, Han.

64
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,500
有惊喜派对呢
Aw, a surprise party.

65
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,020
-是不是很温馨啊  麦克斯  -我才不信咧
- Isn't this sweet, Max? - I don't trust it.

66
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,550
上次奥列格给过我"惊喜"
Last time Oleg yelled "surprise" at me,

67
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,080
他把鸡鸡塞在热狗面包中间了
his penis was on a hot dog bun.

68
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,600
一盒肉香满溢披萨
One meat lover's pizza.

一位肉欲满溢爱人
And one meat lover.

麦克斯  快来  "趁热享用"哦

你去打开那盒子
You're opening that box.

给这个可爱的送披萨男小费啊
to tip the cute pizza delivery guy?

苏菲  他是路易斯  白班服务生

我是他的好朋友
I'm his good friend.

81
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,930
你的口音有点重  我听不太清楚
You know, I'm having trouble hearing your accent.

82
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,140
是"好朋友"还是"女"朋友啊
Did you say "good friend" or "girlfriend?"

83
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,280
拜托  我倒想呢
Please, mami. I wish.

我不要再看励志电影了
I'm not seeing Trouble With the Curve.

因为我也得用我的商业头脑

102
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,020

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,370
这是怎么一回事
What is happening?

106
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,140
有人笑容满面地对我好
People doing nice things for me and smiling?

107
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,660
是不是又要换寄养家庭了
Am I transferring foster homes again?

108
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,810
里面还有别的东西哦
And there's more stuff inside.

109
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,670
你又把惊喜先剧透出来了
That was supposed to be a surprise too.

110
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,050
惊喜吧
Oh. Surprise!

111

无限"骑"[乘坐]吗
Oh. Unlimited rides?

117
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:46,720
你屁股上的骚货纹身是这个吗
Is that what your tramp stamp says?

118
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,370
本来要跟你吵的  但你这吐槽实在是妙
I was gonna get mad, but that was a damn good one.

119
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,000
这又是啥  阿憨的房子吗
What's this? Han's house?

120
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,700
你简单说句"谢谢"就够了
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

121
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,040
谢谢你送我你的房子  阿憨
Thank you for your house, Han.

122
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,480
铅笔盒  我好喜欢啊
It's a pencil case, and I love it.

123
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,070
我刚才还干坐在这  想着你们会不会
And I was sitting here, thinking how you were

124
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,690
忘了明天也是我的大日子呢
all ignoring my part of the big day.

125
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,630
然后你们就送了我这个
And then, you give me this pencil case

126
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,650
带去上班用的铅笔盒  证明我想错了

That's for Max.

128
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,230
你们他妈脑子是哪有问题啊
What the hell is wrong with you people?

129
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,140
麦克斯都不需要用铅笔
Max doesn't even need pencils.

130
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,020
她会在烘焙东西
She'll be baking.

131
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,930
她是会晕乎乎[烘焙]才对
Well, she'll be baked.

Take a look.

Wait, where's the Chef's coat Sophie had monogrammed?

137
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,170
阿憨  这是我要送的惊喜呢
Han, that was supposed to be a surprise.

138
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,340
我故意的  报应来了吧
Oh, I know. Karma's a bitch.

139
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,260

Look.

上面有我名字呢
My name's on this.

142
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,650
唯一上面有过我名字的东西
the only thing my name's ever been on before

143
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,700
是验毒尿检杯

144
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,860
谢谢你们大家
Thank you, everyone.

145

所以那书包里没一样东西是给我的吗
So there is nothing in that bag for me?

146
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,670
毛都没有吗
Nothing?

147
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,150
现在如果送我奥列格的鸡鸡热狗  我都愿意收下
I'd even take Oleg's penis in a hot dog bun right now.

148
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,300

I love the subway.

155
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,980
发泄怒气的完美地点
It's the perfect place to get out aggression.

156
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,960
我刚才锤了一拳别人的肚子
I just punched someone in the kidney.

157
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,590
正是在下
It was me.

158
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,070
我知道
I know.

159
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,350
好臭的屁味
Oh, oh, bad smell,

160
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,020
是谁吃了中东蔬菜球啊
Like someone hooked up with a falafel.

161
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,100
-正是在下  -我知道
-It was me. - I know.

162
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,550
-克制点  -抱歉
- Max. - Sorry.

163
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,920
地铁里  飞机上  舞池中  我任屁自放
Subways, planes, and mosh pits, I let it ride.

164
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,390
我爱死这件上衣干洗后清新的味道了
I love the smell of this fresh, dry-cleaned blouse.

165
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,820
我好兴奋我能摆脱那服务生制服
I am so excited to be out of that waitress uniform,

166
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,600
重新穿上我的时尚工装
and back in my chic business clothes,

167
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,550
然后走进我的办公室
and, you know, going to my office,

168
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,790
在那里运用着我的沃顿才华
where I'll probably save the day

169
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,850
拯救办公室於水火之中
using some of my Wharton magic.

170
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,390
我更喜欢你内心希望全灭的样子
You know, I think I like you better without hope.

171
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,670
麦克斯  你知道这学校学费很贵吧
Max, you know this school is expensive, right?

172
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,260
你会抱着积极心态去上课吧
You're going in with a good attitude, right?

173
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,740
不是啊  不然厄尔的"铅笔盒"是干啥用的
No, that's what Earl's pencils are for.

174
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,330
别担心啦  我会尽力
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

175
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,020
你看  这次我有个书包呢
I mean, look, I have a book bag.

176
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,770
以前我去上学  我妈唯一给我带的东西
The only thing my mother ever sent me to school with

177
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,260
就是张写了"帮忙检查虱子"的字条
was a note that said "Check me for lice."

178
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,130
大家送你书包真是太贴心了
It was so sweet of everyone to give you that,

179
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,350
虽然这害我一整晚睡不着
even though I didn't sleep all night about it.

180
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,730
而且看起来不便宜呢
And it looks kind of expensive.

181
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,160
看看是什么牌子的
Check for a designer label.

182
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,700
何必呢  心意最重要嘛
Why? It's the thought that counts.

183
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,400
胡说八道
Since when?

184
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,010
让我看看
Let me see it.

185
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:33,200
第二大道站
Second avenue station.

186
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,880
这里是第二大道站
This is second avenue.

187
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,750
惨了  麦克斯
No, no, no, Max!

188
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,470
他抢到了书包  很好  麦克斯
No, he got the book bag. Good, Max, good.

189
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,840
千万别放手
Don't let go.

190
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,200
万一车子发动了
What if the train starts to leave

191
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,360
然后我手断了咋办
and my arms pop off?

192
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,070
我还怎么去上烘焙学校啊
How will I go to pastry school?

193
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,630
我就得跟那些残疾用嘴来
I'll be one of those people decorating cookies

194
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,290
装饰饼干的人一样了
with a bag in their mouth.

195
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,730
你是个魔鬼
You are the devil.

196
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,910
魔鬼
The devil.

197
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,480
你就是个渣渣
You have nothing.

198
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,560
拉  麦克斯  快拉  从魔鬼手上拉走
Pull, Max, pull! Pull it from the devil!

199
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,720
拉不走啊  这魔鬼有健身
Can't. The devil works out.

200
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,150
我的书包
My bag.

201
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,780
我的衬衫
My blouse.

202
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,860
我的大麻
My weed.

203
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,440
这下好了  都开始上课了
Oh, great, look. Class has started.

204
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,510
我的新生活已经搞砸了
My new life already blows.

205
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,940
帅气大厨在里面呢
Oh, look. There's Chef gorgeous.

206
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,560
我不想让他看到我这么狼狈
I don't want him to see me like this.

207
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,730
我去洗手间看看
I'm gonna go to the restroom and see

208
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,640
能不能用冷水把这脏污弄掉
if cold water can get out any of the stain.

209
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,820
-快进去上课  -可是我的厨师服跟书包没了
- Go, Max. - But I don't have my chef coat or book bag.

210
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,450
我知道它们只在我生命中存在过几小时
I know I only had them for a couple of hours,

211
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,390
但那是我最美好的时光
but it was the best part of me.

212
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,510
你能行的
You'll do great.

213
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,190
先帮我个忙  检查我有没有虱子
First, do me a favor. Check me for lice.

214
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,160
这门课是设计来向你们介绍
This course is designed to introduce you

215
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,210
一些技术与技巧
to the skills and techniques required

216
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,890
来制作如发面面包
in the production of yeast bread,

217
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,040
酥皮面团  奶黄饼  泡芙
short pastry doughs, custards, pate a choux,

218
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,190
以及蛋糕糊等等
and cake batters.

219
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,040
麦克斯大厨  你迟到了
Chef Max, you are late.

220
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,930
你确定课不是10点17分开始吗
Wait, are sure class doesn't start at 10:17?

221
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,260
对不起  我在地铁上被混蛋给抢劫了
Sorry, I got robbed on the subway by some jerk.

222
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,010
喂喂喂  干嘛指鼻子骂我
Hey, hey, hey, I'm right here.

223
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,010
我没钱走投无路 
I ran out of options, and I didn't wanna

224
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,570
又不想跳脱衣舞赚学费  所以...
strip my way through pastry school.

225
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,980
可以靠脱衣舞赚学费吗
That's an option?

226
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,940
好了  厨师们  专心点
All right, Chefs. Let's focus.

227
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,650
他刚是说他想"搞我们"[专心]吗
Did he say he wants to "foke us"?

228
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,910
{\an8}越洗越糟了

229
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,500
早安啊  碧碧
Morning, Bebe.

230
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,240
天啊  你这是怎么了
Hi. Oh, my God. What happened to you?

231
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,700
我先提醒你  我的医生说
And I should tell you my doctor says

232
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,530
我接下来一个月内都不应该听到坏消息
I'm not allowed to hear bad news for another month.

233
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,770
抱歉我这么狼狈来上班
I apologize for my appearance.

234
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,230
但我们在地铁上被抢了
We got robbed on the subway,

235
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,950
然后被拿着热咖啡的人弄了一身
and then someone hit me with hot coffee.

236
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,750
然后我去用了冷水想洗掉咖啡渍
Then, I went to wash cold water on the stain

237
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,140
结果没洗掉  还弄得像要参加
and somehow wound up entering myself

238
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,080
性感"湿身"选美赛了
in a wet t-shirt contest.

239
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,780
负面能量太多我扛不住
Um, that's a lot of energy for me,

240
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,980
先让我坐在位子上休息
So I'm just gonna need to sit here

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,240
然后平静一会吧
for a second and be quiet.

242
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,760
我知道我现在该让你平静  我也支持
I know we're being quiet, which I'm all about,

243
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
好可爱的小狗啊
but cute dogs.

244
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,070
谢谢  这是可卡犬
Oh, thanks. They're cocker spaniels.

245
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,970
我拯救了他们
I rescue them.

246
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,020
大家都想着去拯救灰狗  斗牛犬啊
You know, people rescue greyhounds and pit bulls,

247
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,290
但都没人想到可卡也需要拯救
but everyone ignores the cocker spaniel.

248
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,380
都觉得可卡犬恶心  要宰了他们
They're like, "Ew, eye goo. Shoot it."

249
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,500
我养了三只可卡[三根鸡鸡]
I have three cockers.

250
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,940
你有宠物吗
Do you have any pets?

251
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,780
有匹马  叫栗宝
I have a horse, Chestnut.

252
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,510
他是只纯种马
He's a thoroughbred.

253
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,150
我该从哪里开始帮忙呢
Well, what can I do first?

254
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,200
这是什么  为什么给了我果汁菜单
What's this? Why am I holding a juice menu?

255
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,990
每天我们都为所有学生与员工
Every day, we get fresh-pressed juice

256
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,610
买新鲜的鲜榨果汁
for the students and the staff.

257
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,630
太享受了
What a treat.

258
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,920
新鲜果汁是纯骗钱的
Fresh juice is such a scam

259
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,870
但是别人请的就不算
unless someone else is payin'.

260
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,650
我要一杯绿色三号
I'll take the greens number three.

261
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,000
好的  写上单子
Uh-huh, well, put it on the list

262
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
然后去问别人要喝什么吧
when you get the other ones.

263
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,010
等等  所以是我得去买果汁吗
Wait, I'm supposed to get the juice?

264
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,880
我就是坏消息集中地
Oh, boy, it's like I'm a bad news machine.

265
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,350
没关系
Okay.

266
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,480
乐意效劳  没意料到  但很乐意帮忙
Happy to do it. Surprised, but happy.

267
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,850
那我可以借一套那可爱的厨师服穿穿吗
Uh, maybe I could change into one of those cute Chef jackets.

268
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,800
尼可拉斯大厨规定了只有烘焙厨师能穿
Oh, Chef Nicholas only permits pastry Chefs to wear these.

269
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,610
但我不能第一天就这么狼狈的出场吧
But I can't meet everyone on my first day looking like this.

270
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,010
当买果汁的人已经够惨了吧
I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.

271
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,510
我有一些健身衣服可以给你穿
I have some workout clothes you can wear.

272
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,420
你放心  我一次都还没穿过
Don't worry. I haven't worn them yet.

273
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,500
但总有一天会穿的
But I will someday.

274
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,780
你们好  大家好啊
Hi. Hi, everyone.

275
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,180
我是来问你们喝什么鲜果汁
I'm here to take the fresh juice orders

276
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,580
也顺便说一声  我本来上班穿的不是这个
and also to say this is not what I came to work in.

277
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,560
我穿的衣服可没瞪着大眼的狗头
What I came to work in had less eyes.

278
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,280
卡洛琳  欢迎你
Caroline, welcome.

279
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,750
-在办公室干得怎么样  -很好  
- How is it going in the office so far? - So great,

280
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,380
我今天真不是穿这个来上班
and so not what I came to work in.

281
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,500
通常我穿的都是香奈儿  而不是犬衣
I'm usually wearing Chanel, not le chien.

282
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,200
那是法语"狗"的意思
That's "dog" in French.

283
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,940
那也是英语"二"的意思
Oh, 'cause it's "dork" in English.

284
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,350
很高兴见到你们俩
Well, it is lovely to see both of your faces.

285
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,250
同学  我们先从基本的开始
Class, we start with the basics.

286
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,370
不  不  后面的同学
No, no, no, you in the back--

287
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,030
喝果汁吗  小姐  想从一个
Juice, miss? Care for a juice

288
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,060
高考成绩1560分的人那点果汁吗[旧制满分1600]
from someone who scored 1560 on her SATs?

289
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,380
你居然考超过500分
You can score more than 500?

290
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,510
你干嘛要穿这件衣服啊
Why the hell are you wearing that?

291
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:03,810
这让你的胸部显得更平更悲哀
I didn't think your chest could get any sadder.

292
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,240
这是碧碧的衣服
It's Bebe's.

293
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,120
麦克斯  我来这工作不是帮人点果汁的
Max, taking juice orders is not what I came here to do.

294
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,270
我懂你意思  我点一杯宝石红
I hear you. I'll have the ruby red.

295
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,480
我总是保持花嘴干净[龟头]
I always keep the edge clean,

296
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,610
这样当我挤[射]的时候
So when I'm squeezing it,

297
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,730
奶油[精液]就不会喷得哪儿都是了
It's not gonna have cream popping all over the place.

298
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,700
警世良言啊
Words to live by.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,950
可惜我恰恰相反
I have the opposite problem.

300
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,210
瞧  我的"奶油"喷涌而出

你答应过我会认真上课的
You told me you were gonna take school seriously.

不能怪我  是那家伙带坏我
It's not me. That guy's a bad influence.

304

你看他
Look at him.

305
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,010
他长得就像芝麻街卡通里买毒品的人
He looks like someone who sells drugs on Sesame Street.

306
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,580
你敢玩出火就杀了你
You're gonna get in trouble,

307
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,980
我牺牲穿可卡犬衣服
and I am not wearing a cocker spaniel

308
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,770
可不是为了看你被踢出去
so you can get kicked out of class.

309
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,650

大厨  你要觉得这样玩很有意思
Chef, if you find this so funny,

314
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,400
不如你出去跟"五指"姑娘玩吧
why don't you take a fiver?

315
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,390
反正你不就爱说这些吗
Isn't this how your saying goes?

316
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,510
我没爱说这些
I don't have a saying,

317
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,000
但如果我有  那应该是
but if I did, it'd be more like

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,080

不许再开黄腔了

339
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,810
你会带坏我的
You are a bad influence.

340
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,450
我这番话肯定超顺  因为小时候
And I know I nailed that speech 'cause kids at school

341
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,200
同学们总对我说这番话

你居然还是个瘾君子
You're a drug addict too?

347
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
天啊  想不跟你一起混真难

你干嘛让狗头女这样跟你说话啊
Why'd you let the dog lady talk to you like that?

356
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,250
即使穿着那件傻逼衣服  她还是我的朋友

出去  有人准备因为培训的事而被训

This looks like it's going to get dirty and ugly.

379
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,990

May I film it?

380
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,820
如果可以录  我能放到网上卖吗

381
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,350
听着  你这么做不能只是为了我
Look. You can't just do this for me.

385
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,110
我不能为了你才这么做吗
I can't just do it for you,

386
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,250

393
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,950
"记得节育  勿忘阉割"
"Don't forget to spay and neuter me."

394
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,080
好吧  我退学  没关系

-真的吗  -假的  当然有关系啦

因为你去烘焙学校不能只是为了我
because you can't go to pastry school just for me,

400
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,300
而我也不会为了你而退学

你丢了书包和大麻
You lost your man's briefcase and your drugs,

406
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,650
而我丢了自尊和可能有的小恋情
and I lost my dignity and a possible love interest.

407
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,010
惊喜吧

瞧  惊喜就应该是这样
See, that's how it's supposed to go.

409

对啊  因为我们不想再买第三套大厨服了
Yeah, 'cause we're not buyin' another Chef's jacket.

413
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,210
麦克斯  你知道这意味着什么吗
Max, you know what this means?

414
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,970
我得到两次惊喜礼物  而你毛都没有吗
That I got two surprises, and you got nothing?

415
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,140
不  在学校一切都会好的
No, that everything's gonna work out at that school.

416
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,410
我是说  眨眼之间
I mean, in the blink of an eye,

417
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,240
就像这样  事情可以由坏变好
just like this, things can change from bad to good.

418
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,080
也不算完全变好
Well, not totally good.

419
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,860
我依旧毛都没有
They still haven't gotten me anything.

420
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,500
卡洛琳  有你的礼物
Caroline, you didn't not get anything.

421
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,060
给  你专属的铅笔盒

423
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,070
谢谢你们  我感动死了
Thank you, guys. I'm touched.

424
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,150
真是万万没想到啊
I was not expecting it.

425
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,250
是吗  你可是拿一哭二闹三上吊来强迫我们
Really? 'cause you kinda bullied us all into it.

426
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,340
我的SAT成绩语言成绩是780分
So that's a 780 on verbal,

427
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,040
数学成绩也是780分
and a 780 on math.

428
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,230
而且我拿的是金融学位
And with my degree in Finance,

429
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,150
在市里跑来跑去买果汁这种事
jackass-ing around the city getting juice

430
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,000
完全是在浪费我的天赋啊
could be seen as a waste of my talents.

431
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,520
我毕业典礼时的优秀学生代表说过
And as the valedictorian at my graduation said--

432
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,870
也就是我自己说过
and I'm stealin' from myself here,

433
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,050
"我看见了金融界的未来
"I've seen the future of Finance,

434
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,640
也就是我们"
and it's us."

435
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,080
所以你是想让我去买果汁吗
So you want me to get the juices?

真是个有趣的技巧啊  大厨
Hm, interesting technique you got going there, Chef.

440
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,420
伙计  我们得抛弃彼此的无聊搭档
Dude, we gotta ditch these deadbeat partners.

441
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,150
我被一位老奶奶拖累
I'm stuck over there with grandma.

442
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,230
不要  我不想换掉我旁边的大胖子
No, I'm staying with the big guy next to me.

443
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,310
他才不会让我惹麻烦
He's not gonna get me in trouble.

444
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,990
他从不说话  快走开
He never talks. Get outta here.

445
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,610
回到你的桌子上去  胖子阿伯特
Go back to your own table, Fat Albert.

446
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,650
{\an8}《胖子阿伯特》是美国70年代开始风行的热门卡通剧集
主角是一名黑胖子

447
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,650
好吧
Okay.

448
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,490
我回去
I'm going back.

449
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,350
但你叫我胖子阿伯特  是因为我是黑人
And the Fat Albert thing was 'cause I'm black,

450
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,900
不是胖  对不对
Not fat, right?

451
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,690
因为我一年怎么也去两三次健身房吧
'cause I go to the gym two, three times a year.

452
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,300
我听到前面只有说话声  没有干活声
I hear talking, but no baking up front.

453
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,580
不  不  你听到的只有干活声
No, no, no, you only hear baking.

454
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,210
这里在激烈地"干"呢
Just furiously master-baking up here.

455
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,840
蛋白乾要有漂亮的尖角
The meringue needs to have nice peaks.

456
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,840
你们要做出湿湿的尖尖角[乳头]
You are looking to make moist, pointy peaks.

457
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,650
我最喜欢捏"它们"了
I like to pinch them.

458
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,080
主厨  咱俩私下说一句
Chef, seriously, man-to-man,

459
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,590
有个问题
we got a problem.

460
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,670
我觉得麦克斯不应该跟那个大胖子在一组
I don't think Max should be stuck with that big guy.

461
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,980
他太猥琐了
He's not cool.

462
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,150
我刚在那边
I was just over there,

463
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,140
他唯一感兴趣的尖尖角在她身上
and the only pointy peaks he's interested in are hers.

464
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,860
我说的是她的咪咪  主厨
Talkin' boobies here, Chef.

465
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,370
约翰大厨  迪克大厨
Chef John, Chef Deke here

466
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,260
似乎觉得你在性骚扰麦克斯
Seems to think you are sexually harassing Max.

467
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,030
拜托哟
Oh, please.

468
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,190
如果人家要性骚扰别人  那人肯定是你
If I was harassing anyone, it would be you, Chef.

469
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,800
你的魅力无法挡嘛
I mean, come on.

470
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,420
马上回来  姐们儿
Be right back, big Mary.

471
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,860
你真懂我
You know it.

472
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,990
我的果汁呢  都过了一个小时了
Where's my juice? It's been an hour.

473
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,700
情绪波动的精灵去拿了
The mood swing elf's getting them.

474
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,900
听着  我要进去跟尼古拉斯主厨卖骚
Look, I'm coming in there To flirt with Chef Nicholas,

475
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,670
当我进去的时候  我要你说
and when I enter, I need you to say,

476
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,640
"卡洛琳  你看起来美呆了"
"Caroline, you look amazing."

477
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,470
不行
No.

478
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,570
我的身体不允许我说出这种话
I actually physically can't say that.

479
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,920
我宁愿冲进去大喊
I would rather walk in there and yell,

480
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,470
"我有阴虱  刚刚有三只逃跑了"
"I have crabs, and three of them just escaped."

481
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,780
快叫救护车  快叫救护车
Call 9-1-1. Call 9-1-1.

482
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,650
那个可爱的混血男出事啦
Something's happened to the adorable mixed-race one.

483
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,630
迪克
Deke?

484
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,660
他有糖尿病  他需要打胰岛素
He's diabetic. He needs insulin.

485
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,590
这里有人会打针吗
Has anyone here ever administered a needle?

486
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:27,230
"打针"就跟"把针插进去"的意思一样  对吧
Uh, administer means the same thing as "shove it in," right?

487
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,490
很好  很好  麦克斯  你过来
Good, good, good, Max. Come, come, come.

488
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,940
好的  他的注射器在腰包
Okay, uh, his syringes are in his fanny pack.

489
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,280
老实说  我之前干这种事时
I've actually never done this

490
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,880
都得听着重金属摇滚乐
without Iron Maiden playing in the background,

491
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,340
但我来打打看吧
But I'll give it a shot.

492
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,700
在我性感的身躯上随便打一针就行
Just put it anywhere in my hot bod.

493
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,630
上帝保佑
God help us.

494
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,450
我讨厌针  我不敢看了
Oh, I hate needles. I can't look.

495
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,380
女士们  别惊慌失措好吗
Get it together, ladies.

496
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,190
所以医生不准我抱小孩
This is why I'm not allowed to hold babies.

497
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,360
麦克斯  从现在开始你和迪克一组
Max, I think you and Deke should be lab partners from now on

498
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,250
以防今天的事再次发生
in case something like this happens again.

499
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,590
-没问题吧  -我别无选择
- Is that okay? - I guess if I have to.

500
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,820
麦克斯  你呢
Max?

501
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,110
我也别无选择
I guess if I have to.

502
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,150
你是故意不按时打胰岛素吗
What, did you not take your insulin on purpose?

503
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,670
人家真的很想做你搭档嘛
I really wanted to be your partner.

504
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,540
碧碧  我在这里找不到大厨上衣
Bebe, I can't find a Chef jacket anywhere in here.

505
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,320
很抱歉  我知道我不应该穿那个
And I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to wear one,

506
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,590
但我真的很冷
but I'm really cold,

507
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,680
我不能一天都穿着这身衣服走来走去
and I can't walk around like this all day.

508
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,130
或许我可以帮你
Maybe I can help.

509
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,600
你不能又湿又冷地站着
You can't stand there wet and cold.

510
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,880
-穿我的上衣吧  -不  不
- Take my jacket. - Oh, no, no, no.

511
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,040
不用了  那也行
You don't have-- oh, that'll work.

512
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,630
不好意思我里面没穿衣服
I'm sorry about the no shirt under,

513
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,700
我上课的时候  总是觉得很热
but I just get so hot when I'm teaching.

514
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,060
是啊  热  太热[性感]了
Yeah, hot. So hot.

515
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:44,690
我的天啊[法语]
Oh mon dieu.

516
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,050
我正准备[射]给卡洛琳呢
I was just giving it to Caroline.

517
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,770
我是说  她需要换件衣服
I mean, she needs something to wear,

518
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,840
我就把我的给她了
and--and now, she has it.

519
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,020
大厨  晚点见
Chef, I will see you later.

520
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:55,180
卡洛琳
Caroline.

521
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,490
麦克斯  我我找到让我性致昂扬的东西了
Max, I think I found something to keep me interested.

522
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,180
这下奇怪了  现在我成了好学生
This is weird. So I'm the good student now?

523
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,430
而你却成了跟老师上床的那个
And you're the one sleeping with the teacher?

524
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,710
我们又没上床
We're not sleeping together.

525
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:09,600
干嘛这么说  你觉得他想要我吗
Why? Do you think he wants to?

526
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,520
我不知道  但在胖子姐们儿扑过去前
I don't know, but you better hurry it up

527
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,570
你最好早点下手
before big Mary gets him.
