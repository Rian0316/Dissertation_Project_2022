1
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,839
Something wrong?

2
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:55,509
To the man who loves art for its own sake,

3
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,478
it is frequently in its least important...

4
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,446
...and lowliest manifestations...

5
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:04,518
...that the keenest pleasure is to be derived.

6
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:10,591
Oh, if you say so,
Holmes.

7
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:15,629
It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson,

8
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,265
that you have so far grasped this truth...

9
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,134
...that in these little records of our cases...

10
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,702
...which you have been
good enough to draw up,

11
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,871
and I am bound to say,
occasionally embellish,

12
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,306
that you have given
prominence not so much...

13
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,143
...to the many cause celebes
and sensational trials...

14
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:30,711
...in which I have figured,

15
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,813
but rather to those incidents...

16
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,949
...which have given room for
those faculties of deduction...

17
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,888
...and logical synthesis which I
have made my special province.

18
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:46,426
Kind of you to say so, Holmes.

19
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,566
You have erred,
perhaps -...

20
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,275
...you have erred...

21
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,343
...in attempting to put color and life...

22
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:04,812
...into each of your statements,

23
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,314
instead of confining yourself
to placing upon record...

24
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,585
...that severe reasoning
from cause to effect...

25
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:16,700
...which is really the only notable
feature about the thing.

26
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,731
You are always in a disputatious mood...

27
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,999
...when you choose that pipe.

28
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,367
It seems to me that I have done you...

29
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,203
...full justice in the matter.

30
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,105
No, no, no,
no, no, no,

31
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,907
it is not selfishness or even conceit.

32
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,709
If I claim full justice for my art,

33
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,745
it is because crime is common;

34
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:40,280
logic is rare.

35
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,684
Therefore, it is upon logic
rather than upon crime...

36
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,454
...that you should dwell.

37
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:50,257
You have degraded what
should have been a course...

38
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:54,294
...of lectures into a series of tales.

39
00:04:54,361 --> 00:04:55,362
Really, Holmes,

40
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,899
I hardly think my poor
scribblings deserve that.

41
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,569
They have, after all, made
your name a household word.

42
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,794
Oh, pshaw,
my dear fellow,

43
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,242
what do the public,
the great unobservant public,

44
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,577
who can hardly tell a weaver by his tooth...

45
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,746
...or a compositor by his left thumb,

46
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:19,686
care about the finer shades
of analysis and deduction?

47
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,055
But, indeed,
if you are trivial,

48
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:33,100
I cannot blame you, the days
of the great cases are past.

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,169
Man, or at least criminal man,

50
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,006
has lost all enterprise and originality.

51
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,607
Oh, surely not.

52
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,877
I fear so.

53
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,145
As to my little practice,

54
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,115
it seems to be degenerating
into an agency...

55
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,951
...for recovering lost lead pencils...

56
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:54,521
...and giving advice to young
ladies from boarding schools.

57
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,423
My dear,
dear friend,

58
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,292
how can you say such a thing?

59
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:02,796
I think I have touched bottom, finally.

60
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,132
However, this note I had this morning...

61
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,834
...marks my zero-point,
I fancy.

62
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,537
Well, goodness,
who is it from?

63
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:14,641
Read it.

64
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,845
'Dear Mr. Holmes:
I am very anxious to consult you...

65
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,947
...as to whether I should or
should not accept a situation...

66
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:24,418
...which has been offered
to me as a governess.

67
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,520
I shall call at half-past ten tomorrow...

68
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,590
...if I do not inconvenience you.

69
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,376
Yours faithfully,
Violet Hunter.'

70
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,001
I must confess to being
somewhat puzzled...

71
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,472
...by the contents of your letter,
Miss, uh, Hunter,

72
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,374
since the matter on
which you seek advice...

73
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:50,577
...is somewhat outside my
usual field of expertise.

74
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,379
Yes,
I am aware of that.

75
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,815
But you will excuse my
troubling you, I am sure,

76
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,252
since I have recently had
a very strange experience.

77
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,020
Indeed?

78
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,424
As I have no parents or
relations of any sort...

79
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:05,592
...from whom I could ask advice,

80
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,861
I thought perhaps
you would be kind enough...

81
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:11,098
...to tell me what I should do.

82
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,200
I shall be happy to serve
you in any way I can;

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,302
pray, proceed.

84
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,840
There is a well-known agency for
governesses in the West End,

85
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,210
called Westaway's, and I have
lately been calling there...

86
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,213
...about once a week in
order to see whether...

87
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:30,138
...anything has turned up
which might suit me.

88
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,863
It is managed by Miss Stoper.

89
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,866
She sits alone in her own office,

90
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,135
and the ladies who are
seeking employment...

91
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,104
...wait in the anteroom,

92
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,439
and are then shown in one by one,

93
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,541
when she consults her
ledgers and sees whether...

94
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,411
...she has anything which might suit them.

95
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,279
Miss Green has been on
our books for some years...

96
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,148
...and has excellent references.

97
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:05,052
In fact, were it not for
the swift return to Kuala Lampur...

98
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,087
...of her present employer,

99
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,790
who finds her most satisfactory,

100
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,565
she would not be available
today for your consideration.

101
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,504
Thank you,
Miss Green.

102
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,573
Oh, that will do.

103
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,917
I could not ask for anything better.

104
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,987
Oh, capital,
capital.

105
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,322
Splendid.

106
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:17,291
Please be seated,
Miss Hunter.

107
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,126
Now, then, you are looking
for a situation, miss?

108
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,160
Yes, sir.

109
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,228
As a governess?

110
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,129
Yes, sir.

111
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,564
And what salary do you ask?

112
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,232
I had four pounds a
month in my last place...

113
00:09:25,332 --> 00:09:26,834
...with Colonel Spence Munro.

114
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:29,837
He has given her an excellent
reference, Mr. Rucastle.

115
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,405
Oh, doubtless,
doubtless,

116
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,741
but four pounds a month?

117
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,343
If that seems too much -

118
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,745
Too much?
oh, tut, tut,

119
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:41,381
how could anyone offer
so pitiful a sum to a lady...

120
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,752
...with such attraction
and accomplishments?

121
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,554
My accomplishments,
sir,

122
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:50,119
may be less than you imagine.

123
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:53,861
A little French, a little
German, music, drawing -

124
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,062
Oh, tut, tut,

125
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,498
that is quite beside the question.

126
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,768
The point is, have you or have you not...

127
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:03,737
...the bearing and deportment of a lady?

128
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,441
I mean, that is it in a nutshell.

129
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,744
I would hope to have ladylike qualities, sir.

130
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:11,845
If you have not,

131
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,081
then you are not fitted
for the rearing of a child...

132
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,949
...whose background and qualities point...

133
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,551
...to a brilliant future.

134
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,054
And if you have, why, how
can any gentleman ask you...

135
00:10:20,154 --> 00:10:25,492
...to condescend to accept
anything under three figures?

136
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,061
Three figures,
sir?

137
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:29,630
Your salary with me, madam,

138
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,202
would commence at a
hundred pounds a year.

139
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:38,405
I hardly know what to say.

140
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:41,608
It has also been my custom
to advance my young ladies...

141
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:46,580
...a small portion of their salary beforehand,

142
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,216
so that they might meet
any little expenses...

143
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:53,187
...of their journey and their wardrobe.

144
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,390
Thank you, sir.

145
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,493
May I ask where you live?

146
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,096
Oh, Hampshire,
charming rural place,

147
00:11:02,196 --> 00:11:03,664
The Copper Beeches,

148
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:06,166
five miles on the further side of Winchester.

149
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:09,603
Oh, it is the most lovely country,

150
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:14,441
my dear young lady, and
the dearest old country house.

151
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,110
And my duties, sir?

152
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,345
I should be glad to know
what they would be.

153
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:21,815
One child, one dear little
romper just six years old.

154
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:23,484
How charming.

155
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:26,453
Oh, Miss Stoper,
if you could only see him...

156
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,783
...killing cockroaches with a slipper,

157
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,459
three of them gone before you could wink.

158
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,395
Very clever.

159
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,798
My sole duties, then,

160
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,467
are to take charge of a single child?

161
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,536
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no,

162
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:44,872
not sole,
my dear young lady.

163
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,441
Oh, what else, then?

164
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,942
Well, your duty would be,

165
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,011
as I am sure your good
sense would suggest,

166
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,515
to obey any little commands
that my wife might give.

167
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:57,451
You said commands?

168
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,786
Provided,
of course,

169
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,321
that they were such
commands as any young lady...

170
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,091
...might with propriety obey.

171
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,460
You see no difficulty?

172
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:11,965
None, whatsoever.

173
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,735
I should be happy to make myself useful.

174
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,303
Quite so.

175
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:20,007
In dress, for example,
we are faddy people,

176
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:23,844
you know, Miss Hunter,
faddy, but kind-hearted.

177
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,913
And if you were asked to wear any dress...

178
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,048
...that we might give you,

179
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:32,586
you would not object
to our little whims, huh?

180
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,988
Why, um, no.

181
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:37,958
Or to sit here,
or to sit there,

182
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,861
and that would not be offensive to you?

183
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,298
No.

184
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:49,369
Or to cut your hair quite
short before you come to us?

185
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:51,471
Cut my hair?

186
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:55,609
Quite short.

187
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:58,378
Well, I am afraid that's quite impossible.

188
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:01,248
And I am afraid it is quite essential.

189
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,618
It's a little fancy of my wife's,

190
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:07,788
and ladies' fancies,
my dear madam,

191
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:13,494
ladies' fancies must be consulted.

192
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:17,698
So you won't cut your hair?

193
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:22,903
No, sir,
I'm afraid I could not.

194
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:29,476
Ah, well,
it is a pity,

195
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,980
because in other respects
you might have done very nicely.

196
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,481
In that case,
Miss Stoper,

197
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:38,236
I had best inspect some
more of your ladies.

198
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:44,792
Miss Hunter,

199
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,095
do you desire your name
to be kept upon our books?

200
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:49,630
If you please,
Miss Stoper.

201
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,599
Well, really,
it seems rather useless,

202
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,603
since you refused the most
excellent offer in this fashion,

203
00:13:56,703 --> 00:14:00,107
you could hardly expect us
to exert ourselves...

204
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,276
...to find another such opening for you.

205
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,411
I'm sorry,
Miss Stoper, but my hair -

206
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,511
Good day,
Miss Hunter.

207
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,986
Now, why on earth should he
want you to cut your hair?

208
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,688
I don't know.

209
00:14:14,788 --> 00:14:17,891
A very strange fact.

210
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:19,326
As you may observe,
Mr. Holmes,

211
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:21,829
my hair is somewhat luxuriant...

212
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:25,099
...and a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.

213
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,135
And most artistic,
if I may so observe.

214
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,038
It has been considered so.

215
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,207
I simply couldn't think of sacrificing it...

216
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,008
...in such an offhand manner.

217
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,811
Well, I should think not, indeed.

218
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:41,048
Oh, such was my feeling at the time.

219
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:43,150
The next day I was inclined to think...

220
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,386
...that I had made a mistake,

221
00:14:45,486 --> 00:14:47,721
and the day after I was sure of it,

222
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,791
when I received a letter
from the gentleman himself.

223
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,795
I have it here,
and I will read it to you.

224
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,831
'Dear Miss Hunter: Miss Stoper has kindly...

225
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,667
...given me your address,
and I write from here to ask...

226
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:03,737
...whether you have
reconsidered your decision.

227
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:06,807
We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter,

228
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,744
or 120 pounds a year,
so as to recompense you...

229
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:14,848
...for any little inconvenience
which our fads may cause you.'

230
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,948
And your hair?

231
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,353
He is insistent.

232
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:22,156
'As regards your hair,
it is no doubt a pity,

233
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:25,025
especially as I could not
help remarking its beauty...

234
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,027
...during our short interview.

235
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,897
But I am afraid I must
remain firm upon this point,

236
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,366
and I only hope that the increased salary...

237
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:35,936
...may recompense you for the loss.'

238
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,337
Will it?

239
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,908
My mind is made up that
I will accept the offer.

240
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:44,711
I thought, however, that
before taking the final step,

241
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,880
I should like to submit the whole matter...

242
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,049
...for your consideration.

243
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,551
My dear Miss Hunter,

244
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:52,419
as your mind is already made up,

245
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,288
the matter is settled.

246
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,690
But, if at any time you
should find yourself...

247
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,358
...in any doubt or danger -

248
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,626
Danger?

249
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:01,361
What danger do you foresee?

250
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,264
There seems to be a danger,
if we could define it.

251
00:16:04,364 --> 00:16:05,899
But at any time,
day or night,

252
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:10,304
a telegram will bring me down to your help.

253
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,209
Then that is enough.

254
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,645
I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,

255
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:22,962
and go down to Hampshire
quite easy in my mind now.

256
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,018
Thank you.

257
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,425
Well, Holmes?

258
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:43,947
I should allow no sister of mine
to accept such a situation.

259
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,549
That's my man, Toller,
he likes to keep it secure.

260
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,485
But you look apprehensive,
Miss Hunter.

261
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,320
Not at all,
Mr. Rucastle.

262
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Good, good.

263
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,187
You must be Edward,

264
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,089
I have looked forward to meeting you.

265
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,390
Master Edward,

266
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,194
this is your new governess, Miss Hunter.

267
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,564
Oh, I see you have
a present for Miss Hunter.

268
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,866
Oh, well done,
good shot.

269
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,636
Copper Beeches,
Mr. Rucastle?

270
00:18:55,736 --> 00:19:00,674
All dead, Miss Hunter,
mostly dead.

271
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,817
Here we are, then,
come in, come in.

272
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,287
Oh, Mrs. Toller, this is Miss Violet Hunter,

273
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:18,402
who is taking up the position
of governess to Master Edward.

274
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:25,499
How do you do,
Miss Hunter?

275
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,434
Your room is all ready for you.

276
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,002
Thank you.

277
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:32,172
Come along now, Toller,
fetch the trunk.

278
00:19:32,272 --> 00:19:36,110
Oh, Miss Hunter, after you are
refreshed from your journey,

279
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,848
I'll take you on a tour
of The Copper Beeches.

280
00:19:55,095 --> 00:19:58,265
The premises is certainly
extensive, Mr. Rucastle.

281
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:02,369
Oh, yes, and the extensive
premises need protection.

282
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:06,540
Look in here,
isn't he a beauty?

283
00:20:06,607 --> 00:20:09,643
Don't be frightened,
Miss Hunter,

284
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,378
it's only Carlo,
my mastiff.

285
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,914
I call him mine,
but in fact,

286
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,984
Toller is the only man
that can do anything with him.

287
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,685
He lets him loose at night,

288
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:22,156
and God help any trespasser
he lays his fangs upon.

289
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:24,458
We feed him once a day,
and not too much then,

290
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,728
so that he is always keen as mustard.

291
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:31,064
Oh, for goodness sakes,
Miss Hunter,

292
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:36,737
under no pretext set foot
across this threshold at night;

293
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:40,908
it's as much as your life is worth.

294
00:20:55,823 --> 00:20:58,392
Mrs. Rucastle will be here shortly,

295
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:00,527
and she will tell you
herself how delighted she is...

296
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,197
...you are able to accept this situation.

297
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:06,100
Your offer was a most generous one, sir.

298
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:14,274
Though, well, I am still
curious about the conditions.

299
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,377
My little fads and fancies,
you mean?

300
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,212
Yes.

301
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:21,448
But they're nothing at all.

302
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,084
My wife is very fond of a particular shade...

303
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:27,154
...of electric blue,

304
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,390
and she would like you
to wear such a dress indoors...

305
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,492
...in the morning.

306
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,427
But I do not have such a dress.

307
00:21:33,527 --> 00:21:38,465
Ah, but we have one.

308
00:21:38,532 --> 00:21:40,901
As to sitting here or there...

309
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:44,438
...or amusing yourself in
any matter indicated,

310
00:21:44,538 --> 00:21:49,810
well, that need cause you no
inconvenience, need it?

311
00:21:49,877 --> 00:21:51,877
No.

312
00:22:02,356 --> 00:22:04,158
How do you do,
Miss Hunter?

313
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,894
I'm sorry I was not here to greet you,

314
00:22:06,994 --> 00:22:09,863
a slight indisposition.

315
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,132
I trust you are feeling better now?

316
00:22:12,232 --> 00:22:14,568
Much better,
thank you.

317
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:17,504
I was just telling Miss Hunter
about the blue dress.

318
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:24,044
Yes, I think it would fit you very well.

319
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:46,193
I wonder what desperate circumstances...

320
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:48,662
...could occasion such an appeal?

321
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,597
I have devised seven
separate explanations,

322
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:53,400
each of which would cover the
facts as far as we know them.

323
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,105
Oh, and which one do you favor, Holmes?

324
00:23:58,205 --> 00:24:01,141
At the moment,
I have no favorites.

325
00:24:01,275 --> 00:24:09,383
Data, data, data, I cannot
make bricks without clay.

326
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,752
Well, it's nice to get away from the fogs...

327
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:14,121
...of Baker Street now and again.

328
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,223
What delightful little farms these are,

329
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:19,393
don't you agree, aren't
they fresh and beautiful?

330
00:24:19,493 --> 00:24:20,928
You know,
Watson,

331
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:23,197
it is one of the curses of having a mind...

332
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:26,734
...with a turn like mine that
I must look at everything...

333
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:30,070
...with reference to my own special subject.

334
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,772
Well, it doesn't make the scenery...

335
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:33,807
...any less admirable,
does it?

336
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,776
You look at these scattered houses,

337
00:24:35,876 --> 00:24:37,644
and you are impressed by their beauty.

338
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:40,147
I look at them, and the only
thought which comes to me...

339
00:24:40,247 --> 00:24:42,416
...is a feeling of their isolation...

340
00:24:42,516 --> 00:24:45,819
...and of the impunity with which
crime may be committed there.

341
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,154
Good heavens,

342
00:24:47,254 --> 00:24:51,058
who would associate crime
with these dear old homesteads?

343
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:54,228
They always filled me with a certain horror.

344
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:58,098
It is my belief, Watson,
founded upon my experience,

345
00:24:58,198 --> 00:25:00,601
that the lowest and vilest alleys in London...

346
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:03,137
...do not present a more
dreadful record of sin...

347
00:25:03,237 --> 00:25:06,173
...than does the smiling
and beautiful countryside.

348
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,942
Had this young lady who
appeals to us for help...

349
00:25:09,042 --> 00:25:10,677
...gone to live in Winchester,

350
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:13,514
I should never have had a fear for her.

351
00:25:13,614 --> 00:25:18,585
It is the five miles of country
which makes the danger.

352
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,615
What can it mean,
Mr. Holmes?

353
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:53,654
We cannot theorize without data, I'm afraid.

354
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:57,658
Please, continue,
Miss Hunter.

355
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,159
In the first place,

356
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,695
I may say that I have met, on the whole,

357
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,831
with no actual ill-treatment from

358
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:05,931
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle.

359
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:08,869
But I am not easy in my mind about them,

360
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:12,105
and I cannot understand them.

361
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,741
What can't you understand?

362
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,578
The reasons for their conduct.

363
00:26:17,644 --> 00:26:20,147
For two days after my arrival
at the Copper Beeches,

364
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:22,583
my life was very quiet.

365
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:26,153
On the third, I went downstairs
after breakfast to find

366
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,856
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle in the drawing room.

367
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:32,259
Mr. Rucastle informed me that a dress,

368
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:35,929
an electric blue dress,

369
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,365
had been laid out for me in my bedroom,

370
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,534
and asked me to put it on.

371
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:42,634
I did as he requested.

372
00:27:07,327 --> 00:27:11,732
Oh, superb, Miss Hunter,
oh, quite superb.

373
00:27:11,832 --> 00:27:13,567
Do you not agree?

374
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,569
It could not be a better fit,

375
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,405
not if you had been measured for it.

376
00:27:18,505 --> 00:27:22,810
Please, be so good
as to sit down, Miss Hunter.

377
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,847
Oh, perfect, I mean,
it's quite, quite perfect.

378
00:27:26,914 --> 00:27:29,883
Over here, if you don't mind,
Miss Hunter.

379
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:33,654
There, there,
there now, excellent.

380
00:27:33,754 --> 00:27:35,255
Are you quite comfortable?

381
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:37,355
Yes, thank you.

382
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:46,333
How long do you wish me
to remain here, sir?

383
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:50,404
Oh, an hour, perhaps,
perhaps longer.

384
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:51,839
An hour?

385
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:54,975
Oh, but not, I assure you,
an hour of tedium.

386
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:58,145
Let us see how we can best
entertain and divert you.

387
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:01,715
Do you enjoy funny stories,
Miss Hunter?

388
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,849
Why, yes.

389
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:05,352
Well, then, I shall tell you some,

390
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:09,362
and all of them, I assure you,
absolutely true.

391
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,526
Let me tell you about George.

392
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:14,695
He is the most extraordinary character.

393
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:17,664
Well, it seems, somebody wanted
to find his way to Winchester,

394
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:20,501
and George, he really is such an eccentric,

395
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:22,603
you might mistake him for a scarecrow,

396
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,605
I mean,
his legs are all astray,

397
00:28:24,705 --> 00:28:27,608
his arms always thrust out like this,

398
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,977
his head shaved like a turnip,

399
00:28:30,077 --> 00:28:34,781
and on his head he wore
the most extraordinary hat -

400
00:28:34,915 --> 00:28:36,617
Then Mr. Rucastle,

401
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:39,353
walking up and down on
the other side of the room,

402
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:42,322
began to tell me a series
of the funniest stories

403
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:45,259
I've ever listened to.

404
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:48,328
You cannot imagine how comical he was.

405
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:52,132
I laughed till I was quite weary.

406
00:28:52,266 --> 00:28:54,635
Two days later this same performance...

407
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,104
...was gone through again.

408
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:06,814
This is the peace of God,
that passes all understanding.

409
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:12,486
Oh, bless my soul,
is that the hour already?

410
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:16,056
Time has passed very quickly,
and most amusingly, sir.

411
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:18,058
Well, I'm glad to hear you say so.

412
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,828
But now, it is time for you
to attend to your duties,

413
00:29:20,928 --> 00:29:22,763
so go and change your dress,

414
00:29:22,863 --> 00:29:25,566
and then look to little
Edward in the nursery.

415
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:27,167
You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes,

416
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,570
how curious I became
as to what the meaning...

417
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,608
...of this extraordinary
performance could be.

418
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:38,445
Since my face was always
turned away from the window,

419
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:41,382
I became consumed with
the desire to see...

420
00:29:41,482 --> 00:29:44,542
...what was going on behind my back.

421
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:47,788
On the very next occasion,

422
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:52,530
I managed to conceal a small
piece of mirror in my hand.

423
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:56,030
Oh, George,
I can't tell you -

424
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,731
In the midst of my laughter,

425
00:29:57,831 --> 00:30:01,301
I raised my handkerchief to my eyes,

426
00:30:01,401 --> 00:30:03,570
and was able with a little management...

427
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,341
...to see all there was behind me.

428
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:10,043
There was nothing,

429
00:30:10,177 --> 00:30:14,915
at least that was my first impression.

430
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:16,750
At second glance,
however,

431
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,086
I perceived that there was a bearded man...

432
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:22,089
...leaning against the railings
which bordered our field,

433
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:25,626
and was looking up earnestly at the house.

434
00:30:25,726 --> 00:30:29,897
I lowered my handkerchief
and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle,

435
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:36,203
to find her eyes fixed upon me
in a most searching gaze.

436
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,771
She said nothing,

437
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:42,546
but I'm convinced she divined
I had a mirror in my hand.

438
00:30:43,377 --> 00:30:47,014
Jephro, there is an impertinent fellow...

439
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,483
...who stares up at Miss Hunter.

440
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:51,585
Oh, does he indeed?

441
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:53,287
No friend of yours,
Miss Hunter?

442
00:30:53,387 --> 00:30:56,192
No, I know no one in these parts.

443
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:58,926
Oh, dear me,
how very impertinent.

444
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,661
Quite intolerable.

445
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,996
Kindly turn around,
Miss Hunter,

446
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:05,566
and motion him to go away.

447
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,635
Surely it would be better
if we took no notice.

448
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:10,637
What, and have him loitering here always?

449
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:12,806
No, turn around,
Miss Hunter,

450
00:31:12,906 --> 00:31:16,743
and wave him away like this.

451
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,496
That was a week ago,

452
00:31:35,596 --> 00:31:38,799
and from that time I have
not sat in the window,

453
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:41,035
nor have I worn the blue dress,

454
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:44,671
nor seen the man with the beard.

455
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:47,474
But something else occurred,

456
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:53,147
an event which caused you
to summon me with such urgency?

457
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,253
Yes, yes,
oh, Mr. Holmes,

458
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,023
I've never been so frightened.

459
00:32:03,123 --> 00:32:05,726
Do not distress yourself,
Miss Hunter,

460
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:10,931
compose yourself, and then
tell us what it was.

461
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:18,205
There is a turret to the house...

462
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:22,276
...which appears not to be inhabited at all.

463
00:32:22,376 --> 00:32:25,546
A door which faces that
which leads into the quarters...

464
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:28,682
...of the Tollers opens into the turret,

465
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,285
but it is invariably locked.

466
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:33,520
It was only yesterday
that the chance came...

467
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:38,525
...for me to pass beyond the door.

468
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:39,626
Toller?

469
00:32:39,726 --> 00:32:42,896
Yes.

470
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,085
So it was you,
then.

471
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:48,088
I thought it must be when
I saw the door open.

472
00:34:48,188 --> 00:34:50,824
I'm so frightened.

473
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:54,361
Oh, my dear young lady,

474
00:34:54,495 --> 00:34:58,999
oh, my dear young lady,
what has frightened you,

475
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:02,436
my dear young lady?

476
00:35:02,503 --> 00:35:06,106
I - I was foolish enough...

477
00:35:06,206 --> 00:35:09,877
...to go up into the shuttered turret.

478
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:13,180
You noticed it was shuttered then?

479
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:16,350
Yes.

480
00:35:16,483 --> 00:35:20,287
Photography is one of my hobbies.

481
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:23,857
I have made my dark room up there.

482
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:28,162
What an observant young
lady one has come upon.

483
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,731
It was so lonely and eerie in this dim light...

484
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:34,535
...that I was frightened and ran out again.

485
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:41,575
It's so dreadfully still in there.

486
00:35:41,675 --> 00:35:44,478
Only that?

487
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:51,418
Why, yes, what do you think,
what other reason?

488
00:35:51,518 --> 00:35:54,722
Why do you think I keep that door locked?

489
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,657
I'm sure I don't know.

490
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:59,259
It is to keep people out
who have no business there,

491
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,594
do you see?

492
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:01,929
I'm sure if I had known -

493
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,331
Well, you know now.

494
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:07,735
And if you ever set foot
across that threshold again,

495
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:12,372
I'll throw you to the mastiff.

496
00:36:22,716 --> 00:36:30,858
I was so terrified that
I didn't know what to do.

497
00:36:30,924 --> 00:36:35,929
Then I thought of you,
Mr. Holmes.

498
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:38,599
I had no difficulty in getting leave to come...

499
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:40,534
...to Winchester this morning,

500
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:42,836
but I must be back by 3:00 o'clock,

501
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:45,039
for Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle
are going on a visit...

502
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:47,041
...and will be away all evening,

503
00:36:47,141 --> 00:36:51,411
so that I must look after the child.

504
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:56,416
Now I've told you all of
my adventures, Mr. Holmes.

505
00:36:56,483 --> 00:37:01,755
What does it mean,
and what should I do?

506
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:06,093
Does the unspeakable child
Edward have a friend?

507
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:07,728
Yes, uh,

508
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:11,031
an equally unpleasant child
at one of the farm cottages.

509
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:14,768
Splendid.

510
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,371
Dr. Watson and I will arrive
at the Copper Beeches...

511
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:19,606
...at 4:30 precisely.

512
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,009
But before then, there are one or two things

513
00:37:22,109 --> 00:37:24,511
I should like you to do.

514
00:37:24,611 --> 00:37:27,581
I would not ask this of you, Miss Hunter,

515
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:32,271
if I did not think you were
quite an exceptional woman.

516
00:39:29,303 --> 00:39:31,572
Mrs. Toller?

517
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:35,008
Mrs. Toller, I think Edward has
locked himself in the cellar.

518
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:36,143
The cellar?

519
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,678
Well, I can't find him anywhere,

520
00:39:37,778 --> 00:39:39,513
and it is past his tea time.

521
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:41,782
Well, just the same,
I don't see why Master Edward...

522
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,550
...would have locked himself in the cellar.

523
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,785
Well, the door was open earlier,

524
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,945
I saw Toller come out with a bottle.

525
00:39:57,764 --> 00:40:01,668
Perhaps he went down
to look for cockroaches.

526
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:04,905
It's locked.

527
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:27,861
There you are, miss.

528
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:30,364
After you.

529
00:40:37,805 --> 00:40:39,540
Our destination.

530
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,877
Holmes, can we be quite sure
the mastiff isn't loose?

531
00:40:43,977 --> 00:40:48,227
We can be sure of nothing
until we reach the house.

532
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:23,148
Good God,
what was that?

533
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:47,038
Come quickly.

534
00:41:50,511 --> 00:41:52,613
To the left,
Mr. Holmes.

535
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:35,189
There has been some villainy here.

536
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:38,492
It looks as though someone
has gone across the roof.

537
00:42:38,592 --> 00:42:47,000
Alice, Alice, Alice,
Alice, Alice.

538
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:54,408
Alice?

539
00:42:54,508 --> 00:42:57,244
Where is my daughter?

540
00:42:57,344 --> 00:42:58,846
That is for me to ask you that.

541
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:00,347
His daughter?

542
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:05,586
Thieves, you spies,
thieves and spies.

543
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:07,777
I have caught you,
have I?

544
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:09,223
I have you in my power.

545
00:43:09,323 --> 00:43:12,326
I'll serve you.

546
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,262
What does he mean?

547
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,965
He's gone for the dog.

548
00:43:25,372 --> 00:43:27,372
Watson.

549
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:55,969
Someone has loosed the dog.

550
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:57,738
It's not been fed for two days.

551
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,340
Quick, before it's too late.

552
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,122
Still unconscious.

553
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,623
I've done what I can for him,

554
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:51,825
he now needs a surgeon
as soon as possible.

555
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:53,527
I've dispatched Toller to Mrs. Rucastle...

556
00:44:53,627 --> 00:44:55,029
...to summon such assistance.

557
00:44:55,129 --> 00:44:56,864
Oh, miss, it's a pity
you didn't let me know...

558
00:44:56,964 --> 00:44:58,332
...what you were planning,

559
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,467
I could have told you
your pains were wasted.

560
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:02,036
It's clear Mrs. Toller knows...

561
00:45:02,136 --> 00:45:03,837
...more of this matter than anyone else.

562
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,040
Well, yes, sir,
I do, and I'm -

563
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,709
I'm ready enough to tell you what I know.

564
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:12,146
But if there's police
court business over this,

565
00:45:12,246 --> 00:45:16,483
you will remember I was Miss Alice's friend.

566
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,786
Miss Alice?

567
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:23,590
Mr. Rucastle's daughter
by his first marriage.

568
00:45:23,724 --> 00:45:28,228
Ah, the mystery of the shuttered turret.

569
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:31,431
Mrs. Toller,
please sit down.

570
00:45:31,565 --> 00:45:35,335
Now, tell me all you know.

571
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:38,906
Well, she was never happy at home,

572
00:45:39,006 --> 00:45:40,040
Miss Alice wasn't,

573
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:43,143
from the time that her father married again.

574
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:45,346
She - she was slighted like,

575
00:45:45,446 --> 00:45:48,182
and had no say in anything.

576
00:45:48,282 --> 00:45:50,984
But - but it didn't became bad for her...

577
00:45:51,084 --> 00:45:54,588
...until after she met Mr. Fowler.

578
00:45:54,688 --> 00:45:58,692
And pray,
who is Mr. Fowler?

579
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:01,962
Well, he was Miss Alice's young man.

580
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:07,367
You - you might have
seen him hanging about,

581
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:09,269
out in the road by the field.

582
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:10,871
Yes.

583
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,740
And how did Mr. Fowler's involvement...

584
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,377
...bring Miss Alice to her
distressing circumstances?

585
00:46:16,477 --> 00:46:19,680
Well, as far as I could learn,

586
00:46:19,813 --> 00:46:24,551
Miss Alice had rights of her own
under her late mother's will,

587
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:27,221
but she was so quiet and patient, she was,

588
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,189
she never said a word about them...

589
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:32,359
...but just left everything
in Mr. Rucastle's hands.

590
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:34,228
Well, he knew he was safe with her,

591
00:46:34,328 --> 00:46:37,798
but when there was a chance
of a husband coming forward,

592
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:40,401
who would ask for all the law will give him,

593
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:45,139
well, then, her father thought
it time to put a stop on it.

594
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:48,008
He wanted her to sign a paper...

595
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,144
...so that whether she married or not,

596
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,479
he could use her money.

597
00:46:52,546 --> 00:46:55,149
Well, when she wouldn't do it,

598
00:46:55,249 --> 00:47:00,053
he kept worrying her,
worrying her,

599
00:47:00,187 --> 00:47:01,922
till she got brain-fever;

600
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:05,259
for six weeks she was at death's door.

601
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:07,861
When she got better at last,

602
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:10,397
all worn to a shadow,

603
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:13,667
and with her beautiful hair cut off,

604
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:17,004
he moved her to the turret room,

605
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:22,676
where she was kept prisoner.

606
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:39,693
But that didn't make no
change in her young man,

607
00:47:39,793 --> 00:47:42,963
and he stuck to her true as a man could be.

608
00:47:43,063 --> 00:47:46,700
And then Mr. Rucastle brought
Miss Hunter down from London...

609
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,969
...in order to impersonate his daughter...

610
00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:51,138
...and get rid of the young man.

611
00:47:51,238 --> 00:47:53,238
Well,
that was it, sir.

612
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,611
But Mr. Fowler being a -
a persevering gentleman,

613
00:47:57,744 --> 00:48:03,117
as a good sailor should be,
blockaded the house.

614
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,720
And having met you succeeded
by certain arguments,

615
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,689
metallic and otherwise,

616
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:12,526
in convincing you that your
interests were the same as his?

617
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:16,463
Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken,

618
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:19,600
free-handed,
gentleman.

619
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:22,169
And in this way he managed
that your husband...

620
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:25,539
...should not want for drink,
the gates unlocked,

621
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,708
thus insuring that the mastiff
should remain chained,

622
00:48:27,808 --> 00:48:30,177
and that a ladder should be
ready to assist him...

623
00:48:30,277 --> 00:48:32,579
...in the rescue of Miss Alice?

624
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:36,984
You have it, sir,
just as it happened.

625
00:48:43,957 --> 00:48:47,394
And thus was solved the mystery
of the sinister house...

626
00:48:47,494 --> 00:48:49,959
...called The Copper Beeches.

627
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:54,068
Mr. Rucastle survived,
but was always a broken man,

628
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:58,105
kept solely alive through
the care of his devoted wife.

629
00:48:58,205 --> 00:48:59,506
They still live with their servants,

630
00:48:59,606 --> 00:49:02,710
who probably know so much
of Rucastle's past...

631
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,815
...that he finds it difficult to part from them.

632
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:13,620
Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle
were married by special license,

633
00:49:13,687 --> 00:49:15,422
and he now holds a government position...

634
00:49:15,522 --> 00:49:18,459
...on the island of Mauritius.

635
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:24,798
Miss Hunter is now head
of a private school in Walsall,

636
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:34,475
where I gather she has met
with considerable success.

637
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:42,082
There, Holmes,
your verdict?

638
00:49:42,182 --> 00:49:45,552
An admirable account,
Watson.

639
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:51,225
Oh, you don't think I've put too
much color and life into it?

640
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:53,494
Oh, my dear friend,

641
00:49:53,594 --> 00:49:56,096
I humbly defer such considerations...

642
00:49:56,196 --> 00:50:01,101
...to your excellent literature.

643
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:03,704
Good.
