跟蟑螂正面沖突
with one of them roaches today.

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,410
要是有一只離你這么近
When you see one right here,

20
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,810
別嚇得尿褲子
try not to shit your pants.

21
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,340
那只會激怒他們
It's only gonna piss them off.

22
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,460
-我盡量  -盡量別理列納
- I'll try. - Try to ignore Len.

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,560
他準頭可差了  全世界唯一一個

我們可以幫你們換一批

他們毀了制冷機  拆解開  拿走了零件

56
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,470
蟑螂往帕恩·海德科家那邊去了
the roaches went in the direction of Parn Heidekker's place.

57
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,720
他是這兒的信教的怪人
Local oddball, seems to be some kind of religious freak.

其余人  去拜訪海德科

問幾個問題  搜查一遍
Ask some questions, sniff around the place.

63
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,180
要是有蟑螂  叫他們知道我們有備而來
If there's roaches, we show we're ready for them.

64
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,980
出發
Let's go.

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,550
海德科先生
So Mr. Heidekker

66
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:54,300
不是社會名流也不是交際型
is not exactly what you call a socialite or a mingler.

67
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,620
似乎有精神問題
Seems like mental health issues.

68
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,250
據說  關于蟑螂  他有些有趣的看法
He's got some interesting views on roaches, by all accounts.

69
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,010
我這就把他的信息加到你們的"麥斯"系統里
I'm putting his info in your Mass system now.

70
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,320
數月前就有人抱怨他

{\an8}姓名  帕恩·海德科  性別  男

當地人說  他讓蟑螂穿過他的地盤
Locals claim that he let roaches cross his land,

73
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,730
還給他們留下食物
left food out for them.

74
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,460
也可能只是當地村民胡扯  所以...
Could be just shit talk from the local villagers though so...

75
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,080
還剩多少蟑螂
Yo, how many roaches we got left out here?

76
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,190
幾千  還是幾百
A couple of thousand? A couple of hundred, if that?

77
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,530
家鄉那邊有幾百萬呢
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

78
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,110
才兩年時間  他們就又卷土重來
It only took two years to get shit back on track.

79
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,720
這兒還有給他們殘羹剩飯的鄉巴佬
Out here you got rustic fucks throwing them scraps.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,730
難怪消滅他們要那么久
No wonder it's taken so long to mop shit up.

81
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,530
但怎么會有人傻到幫蟑螂呢
But how can anyone be dumb enough to help a fucking roach?

82
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,600
誰說不是呢
Hell, yeah.

-你想干什么  -只想談談
- What is it you want? - Just to talk.

105
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,260
我們不正在談嗎
That's what we're doing.

106
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,310
我們進去談會更親切一點
Be a little more neighbourly if we did it inside.

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
檢查樓上房間
Check the upstairs rooms.

108
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,080
放松  我不是你的敵人
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,280

誰在哪
Where are who?

111
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,070
那邊村子里有一群
You know, we got a whole bunch of frightened,

112
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,760
害怕又憤怒的人
angry people in that village.

113
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:37,670
蟑螂闖進了食品店
Roaches have been breaking into the food stores,

114
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,350
偷了食物
stealing supplies.

115
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,700
你知情嗎
You know anything about that?

116
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,610
不
No.

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,100
不光是偷東西的問題
See, it's not just what they stole.

118
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,630
剩下的食品也要被銷毀
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

119
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,980
-沒人會吃的  -斯崔普
- No one's gonna eat it. - Stripe.

120
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,060
讓每個人都更不好過了
Makes life harder for everyone.

121
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,280
墻上掛著十字架  你有原則
Cross on the wall there. You got principles.

122
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,090
你認為所有生命都是神圣的
Think all life is sacred.

123
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,400
我理解
And I get it.

124
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,700
我同意  所有生命都是神圣的
I agree. All life is sacred so...

125
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,750
所以你連蟑螂也得保護  是嗎
you even got to protect the roaches. Right?

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,850
他們那樣不是他們的錯
It's not their fault they're like that.

127
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,790
又不是他們想那樣
They didn't ask for this.

128
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,180
我明白  我們明白
I get it. We get it.

129
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,580
他們血液里有壞東西  才變成那樣的
There's shit in their blood that made them that way.

130
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,320
他們攜帶著疾病
The sickness they're carrying.

131
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,550
疾病才不管生命的神圣
That doesn't care about the sanctity of life

132
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,400
也不管還有誰要受苦受難
or the pain about who else is gonna suffer.

133
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,180
要是在五年  十年  二十年之內
We don't stop the roaches, in five, ten,

134
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,310
消滅不了蟑螂
20 years from now,

135
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,080
還會有孩子生下來就是那樣
you're still gonna get kids born that way,

136
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,490
然后他們還會繁殖
and then they're gonna breed.

137
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
找到了
Bingo.

138
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,170
這樣永無休止  痛苦循環往復
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

139
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,320
那種病本是可以避免的
That sickness, and it could have been avoided.

140
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,490
該死的蟑螂窩
Fucking roach nest.

141
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,370
你去搜那里  我檢查樓梯
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

142

今天你救下的每個蟑螂
Every roach you save today,

143
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,800
天知道
you condemn God knows

144
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,010
明天會有多少人將因此痛苦絕望
how many people to despair and misery tomorrow.

145
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,530
你不能還把他們當人看
You can't still see them as human.

146
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,300
你的情緒我可以理解  但這是錯的
Understandable sentiment, granted, but it's misguided.

147
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,970
人類還想生存下去
We gotta take them out

148
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,150
我們就得把他們鏟除干凈
if humankind is gonna carry on in this world.

149
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,160
事實就是這樣
That's just the hard truth.

150
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,380
必須做出犧牲
Gotta make sacrifices.

151
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,660
搞什么
What the fuck?

152
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,330
幫我一把
Help me out here!

153
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,650

154
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:42,100
*哪怕羞辱我  我也依然在乎你*
*Try to shame me and still I'll care for you*

155
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,820
*隨你東游西逛  就算貶低我[壓倒我]*
*You can run around, even put me down*

156
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:54,040
*我也依然等著你*
*I'll still be there for you*

157
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,020
小賴
Rai!

158
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,270
拜托  我們回基地得聽一路
Come on. We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School

159
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,390
主日學校老師念經嗎
all the way back to base?

160
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,060
堵上耳朵就行了
You can cover your ears.

161
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,630
好  或者我按下永久靜音鍵
Yeah, or, uh.... I'll just hit permanent mute.

162
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,790
放下槍
Lower your weapon.

163
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,400
殺蟑螂同情者也算一次擊殺吧
Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

164
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,170
他是平民
He's a civ, right?

165
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,500
你殺死平民
You shoot a civ,

166
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,200
會終生不得安寧
that's gonna stay with you the rest of your life.

167
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,350
斯崔普
Yo, Stripe,

168
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,750
你可不可以  別那么假正經
why don't you, uh... pull the stick out of your ass?

169
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,560
因為我在作弄他  不是你
Because I'm fucking with him, not you.

170
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,230
看來你倆都信了  是吧
I guess I had you both going, right?

171
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,860
好了
All right!

172
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,490
把這里燒掉
Let's torch the place.

173
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,890
你沒事吧
Hey, you okay, man?

174
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,570
沒事
Yeah.

175
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
-我聽說你消滅了一只  -兩只
- I heard you popped one in there. - Two.

176
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,040
慢著  兩只
Wait, two?

177
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,110
我用刀解決了一只
I got another one, with my knife.

178
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,940
用刀  我的天啊
With your knife? Holy shit!

179
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,140
-挺厲害吧  -是啊  你個終結者
- Pretty good, right? - Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

180
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,180
天啊  第一次出外勤  他就殺死了兩只
Damn! First time out, he gets two.

181
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,410
你個走運的王八蛋
You lucky motherfucker, man.

182
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,460
這混蛋要做美夢了
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

183
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
今晚你要得到犒賞了
Gonna get a treat tonight.

184
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,720
我愛你
I love you.

185
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,780
神槍手小姐
Miss Sharp Shooter.

186
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,880
看不起人的混蛋
Patronising fuck!

187
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,290
冷酷無情  你是死神
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

188
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,120
下次不會讓蟑螂跑掉了
Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time.

189
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,870
你還在懊惱那件事
Are you still sweating that?

190
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,810
我從小就追蹤鹿  從不半途而廢
Well, I grew up tracking deer. You never give up.

191
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,040
我討厭被他們逃走的感覺
I don't like it when they get away.

如果那畜生跑進了森林里

195
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,980
可能會逃到邊界  徹底消失
probably made it to the border, gone for good.

196

對你來說沒什么

但我很久沒得手了
It's been a while for me.

199
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,820
本姑娘很焦慮啊
You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

就只是這樣嗎
What, that's all you're gonna give me?

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,070
好吧
Okay?

205
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,200
如果是我一次干掉兩個
You know, if I got two in one go,

206
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,930
我會想來一個小時的高潮
I would want to come for like an hour!

207
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,080
好了  閉嘴
All right, shut up.

208
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,510

看起來一切正常

從身體上來說  你的狀態非常好

242
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,440
你剛參加完戰斗  可能會有些副作用
You've just seen combat, you can expect some sort of side effect.

243
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,050
在農舍的時候
There was this, uh... this thing...

244
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,000
有個會發光的東西
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

245
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,150
-蟑螂拿著的  -蟑螂拿著的

-像個手電筒  -手電筒
- Kind of like a flashlight. - Flashlight?

247
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,040
像是
Kinda.

248
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,500
我也不清楚
I don't know.

249
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,560
說真的  你沒事  "麥斯"沒問題

252
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,660
或許你該和阿奎特談談
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

253
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,610
阿奎特是誰
Who's Arquette?

254
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,560
你就是克尼南謝吧
So, you must be Koinanchey?

255
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,740
克尼南格
Koinange.

256
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,690
大家都叫我斯崔普
Folks call me Stripe.

257
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,330
他們為什么這么叫你
Why would they call you that?

258
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,770
應該是也覺得"克尼南格"很難念
Couldn't pronounce Koinange either, I guess.

259
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,320
-真有趣  -謝謝
- That's funny. - Thank you.

260
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,430
稍息  孩子  坐下吧
At ease, son. Sit down.

261
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,610
你最近實現了首次擊殺
So you recently logged your first kills?

262
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,780
兩只蟑螂
Two roaches?

263
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:21,820
還是第一次出勤  很厲害
First time out. It's impressive.

264
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,210
應該是吧
Yeah, I guess.

265
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,960
發生了什么事
So what happened?

266
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,190
什么  擊殺的事嗎
What, with the kills?

267
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,610
是在一個農舍里
I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.

268
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,670
那里有個密室之類的地方
There's this, like, hidden room or something.

269
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,870
我們進去了  發現他們就在里面
We go in and there they are.

270
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,330
第一個是用槍殺的  一槍斃命
First one, I just... It was automatic. Just pop-pop, you know?

271
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,390
嗯  就像訓練的那樣
Right. Just like in training.

272
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:53,580
對  就像那樣
Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

273
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,720
-第二個呢  -他跟我在地上糾纏
- And the second? - I mean, he was on the ground with me.

274
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,500
他
He?

275
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,190
是個男的
It was a he.

276
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,010
所以  是短兵相接了
So, this was close quarters then?

277
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,600
對  他壓在我身上  不斷掙扎
Yeah, he's on top of me. Struggling, I mean...

278
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,930
我夠不到我的步槍  只能刺他
I couldn't reach my rifle so I had to stick him.

279
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,040
刺它  拿刀刺它
Stick it. With my knife.

280
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,390
你對此...感覺如何
And how did that... feel?

281
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,030
-什么感覺  -情感上的
- What, like...? - Emotionally.

282
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,210
沒感覺  一切來得太快  我只是自衛
I didn't. I mean, it was quick. It was self-protection.

283
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,020
我想  我只是覺得松了口氣吧
I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

284
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,990
只是松了口氣
Just relief?

285
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,840
有其他的感覺也很正常
It's not unusual to experience other feelings too.

286
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,150
甚至是片刻的歡愉
A moment of euphoria even.

287
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,200
應該有吧
Yeah, I guess.

288
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,660
我不知道  我以為也許我會...
I don't know, I thought maybe I'd feel...

289
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,420
我不知道
I don't know.

290
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,460
-有其他感覺嗎  -對  比如...
- Something else? - Yeah, like...

291
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,410
后悔
Regret.

292
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,840
什么的  但我沒有這種感覺

I had a few weird moments.

我的"麥斯"好像出了點故障
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

299
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,670
但你的植入物通過了所有診斷
But your implants, I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

300
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,230
-它沒有問題  -嗯  他們說沒問題
- There is nothing wrong with that? - Yeah, they said it's fine.

301
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,980
我也說不好  我只是...
I don't know, I think I just...

302
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,790
覺得它出了點問題
Felt like something was up with it.

303
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,930

你做了件大事
You did a big thing.

306
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,750
你應該感到自豪
You should be proud of yourself.

好嗎
Okay?

308

449
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,300
都不是真的  賴
None of it's true, Rai.

450
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,840
你究竟有什么毛病
What the fuck got you?

451
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,450
都不是真的
None of it's true.

452
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:11,710
見鬼去吧
Fuck you.

453
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,040
起來  靠墻
Get up. Back against the wall.

454
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,140
起來
Get up!

455
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,410
你要我進去嗎
You want me to come in there?

456
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:26,330
沒事  我可以就這樣跟他談
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

457
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:35,340
謝謝  布里利
Thank you, Briley.

458
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,280
斯崔普
Stripe.

459
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:51,630
我們欠你一個道歉
We owe you an apology.

460
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,320
我們沒能發現你麥斯植入物的故障
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

461
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,970
我給你拿了杯咖啡
I got you a coffee.

462
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,560
你在農舍中發現的設備
The device you found in the farmhouse,

463
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,170
你跟醫生提起的那個
you mentioned it to the doctor.

464
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,910
是這個嗎
Is this the thing?

465
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:37,410
我們在你和賴曼搜查的舊街區里也發現了
We found it on an old block that you and Raiman were searching.

466
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:38,450
貌似他們對我們
Looks like they reverse

467
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:41,360
無人機上的某些部件做了逆向工程
engineered it from some of our drone parts and so on.

468
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,900
這里的光傳送出一個代碼
The light here transmits a code.

469
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,550
就像病毒  入侵你的麥斯植入物
It's like a virus. It burrows into your Mass,

470
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:51,370
嘗試從內部將其關閉
trying to shut it down from within.

471
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,370
我跟你說
I tell you,

472
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:58,160
這些蟑螂比我們想的更有創造力
those roaches are getting more ingenious than we give them credit for.

473
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,030
整件事是個謊言
The whole thing is a lie.

474
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,240
我理解你為什么這么說
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

475
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,530
蟑螂
Roaches.

476
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,840
他們跟我們長得一樣
They look just like us.

477
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,750
當然了
Of course they do.

478
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,180
這就是他們危險的原因
That's why they're so dangerous.

479
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,700
人類  我們總說自己不好
Humans. You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

480
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,110
但我們是個真正有同情心的物種
but we're genuinely empathetic as a species.

481
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,650
我們并不真想互相殘殺
I mean, we don't actually really want to kill each other.

482
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:31,040
這是件好事
Which is a good thing.

483
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,020
但未來需要你消滅敵人時就不是了
Until your future depends on wiping out the enemy.

484
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,250
過來  坐下
Come on, sit down.

485
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:55,470
我不知道你在學校學了多少歷史知識
I don't know how much history you studied in school.

486
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,970
很多年前  20世紀初
Many years ago, I'm talking early 20th century,

487
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,160
大部分士兵甚至沒開過槍
most soldiers didn't even fire their weapons.

488
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:05,030
或者就算開槍
Or if they did,

489
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,960
他們也只是朝敵人的頭上放空槍
they would just aim over the heads of the enemies.

490
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:10,260
他們故意這么做
They did it on purpose.

491
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,110
第一次世界大戰中的英國軍隊
British Army. World War I.

492
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:17,200
陸軍準將會拿著棍子走在戰隊中
The brigadier, he'd walk the line with a stick

493
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,620
他會抽打他的士兵讓他們開槍
and he'd whack his men in order to get them to shoot.

494
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:24,050
即便在第二次世界大戰中  交火時
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

495
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,580
只有15%到20%的人會開槍
only 15%, 20% of the men would pull the trigger.

496
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:30,270
世界的命運懸于一線
The fate of the world at stake

497
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,770
只有15%的人開槍
and only 15% of them fired.

498
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,170
這告訴你什么
Now what does that tell you?

499
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,360
這告訴我
It tells me

500
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,750
戰爭本可結束得更快
that that war would have been over a whole lot quicker

501
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:41,700
如果當時軍隊能更高效一些的話
had the military got its shit together.

502
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,940
所以我們進行了改進
So we adapted.

503
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,730
更有效的訓練  更好的調整
Better training. Better conditioning.

504
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,060
之后爆發了越南戰爭
Then comes the Vietnam War,

505
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,870
開火百分比上升到了85%
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

506
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,950
槍林彈雨  但擊殺率仍然很低
Lot of bullets flying. The kills were still low.

507
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:00,030
而且真殺了人的軍人
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

508
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,030
大多數回來后出現了心理問題
well, most of them came back all messed up in the head.

509
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:08,530
直到"麥斯"誕生  才出現轉機
And that's pretty much how things stayed until Mass came along.

510
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,970
"麥斯"
You see, Mass...

511
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,780
是終極軍事武器
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

512
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,170
為你提供情報
It helps you with your intel.

513
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,130
瞄準目標  進行通訊  調整心態
Your targeting. Your comms . Your conditioning.

514
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,870
如果瞄準的是妖怪
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger

515
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:29,520
開槍就容易得多了  對吧
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

516
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:32,510
不僅是視覺
It's not just your eyes, though.

517
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,910
還掌控了你其他的感官
Takes care of your other senses, too.

518
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:37,070
你聽不到尖叫聲
You don't hear the shrieks.

519
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:40,360
聞不到血腥味
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

520
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,980
他們都是人類
They're human beings.

521
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,270
你知道他們的DNA里都有什么嗎
Do you have any idea the amount of shit that's in their DNA?

522
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,280
癌癥高發率
Higher rates of cancer.

523
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,580
肌肉萎縮癥  多發性硬化癥
Muscular dystrophy. MS.

524
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,080
魚鱗癬樣紅皮病  智力低下
SLS. Substandard IQ.

525
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,200
犯罪傾向  性行為異常
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

526
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:04,500
都在那里
It's all there.

527
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,500
都是篩選查到的
The screening shows it.

528
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,500
你希望下一代是這樣的嗎
Is that what you want for the next generation?

529
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,950
別因為盡了責而難受
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

530
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,990
那些村民做不到
The villagers won't do it.

531
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:20,330
國內的民眾做不到
The folks back home won't do it.

532
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:22,840
他們沒有"麥斯"
They don't have Mass.

533
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,270
是"麥斯"讓你下得了手
Mass lets you do it.

534
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,570
你
You.

535
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,910
你是在保護血統
You're protecting the bloodline.

536
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,360
而這是一種榮耀  我的朋友
And that, my friend, is an honour.

537
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,700
根本沒什么榮耀
There's no honour here.

538
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:43,610
只是殺戮
It's just killing.

539
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,090
-謊言與殺戮  -沒人騙你
- Lying and killing. - No one lied to you.

540
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,870
你一直都是知道的
You knew all of this. All along.

541
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,170
你在說什么
What are you talking about?

542
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,890
是你同意植入"麥斯"的
You agreed to have your Mass implant put in.

543
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,410
接受設置  每個士兵都一樣
Set up. Every soldier does.

544
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,030
我們不可能就這么植入它  用夢境欺騙你
We can't just embed it and feed you a dream.

545
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,420
你的大腦會排斥的
Your mind would reject it.

546
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,910
你得自愿接受
You have to accept it. Willingly.

547
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,860
你就是這么做的
It's exactly what you did.

548
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:22,620
你看過條款和條件了嗎
So you see the terms and conditions there?

549
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,350
那好長啊
Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.

550
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,420
這是什么
What is that?

551
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,650
你的授權視頻
That's your consent video.

552
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,790
六個月前你簽約的時候拍的
From when you signed up six months ago.

553
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,520
基本上就是說你同意植入"麥斯"并激活
Basically, it says you agree to Mass implant activation.

554
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,860
-我沒做過這個  -你做過
- I didn't do this. - Yes, you did.

555
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,790
-就像催眠一樣  -行啊
- Works kind of like hypnosis. -Yeah, all right.

556
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,730
你也將同意  你會不知道
Part of what you're agreeing to is not realising

557
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,920
自己處于了這個狀態
you've been put in this state.

558
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,540
能明白嗎  你不會回憶起這次對話
If you follow me. You won't recall this conversation.

559
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,110
還挺有趣的  老兄
That's kind of funny, man.

560
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,690
關掉
Turn it off.

561
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,770
要確認授權
So for you to register consent...

562
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,020
-關了  -請在那兒按指紋
-Turn it off, man. - I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.

563
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:57,960
-這兒嗎  -是的  請
- Right here? - Yes, please.

564
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:01,390
挺好玩
That's dope.

565
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,610
我沒那么做
I didn't do that!

566
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,770
-我不記得了  -正如他說的
- I don't remember that! - Just like the man said.

567
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,230
-我知道你很生氣  -去你媽
- I know you're upset. - Fuck you!

568
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:24,740
怎么回事
What's happening?

569
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:27,130
我們控制你看到的東西  斯崔普
We control what you see, Stripe.

570
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,490
-我什么也看不見  -因為我們關掉了
- I can't see nothing. - Because we control it.

571
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,090
讓我的眼睛恢復正常
Give me my fucking eyes back.

572
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,790
我來說說你的選擇吧
Let me lay out your options.

573
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,970
讓我眼睛恢復正常
Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

574
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,040
聽我說說你的選擇
Let me lay out your options!

575
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,380
選項一  同意重置你的"麥斯"
Option one, you agree to have your Mass reset.

576
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,170
這幾天的全部記憶
All the recollections of the past few days,

577
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,820
包括這次對話  都將被抹去
including this conversation, erased.

578
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,220
不可能
No way.

579
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,430
選項二則是關禁閉
Option two's incarceration.

580
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,110
-建議你考慮一下  -去你媽
- I'd advise you to consider. - Fuck you!

581
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,960
"麥斯"是你的朋友
Mass is a friend.

582
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:12,580
如果沒有它
Without it,

583
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:15,770
你將記得自己做過的每件事
you will remember everything that you did.

584
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,650
我才不要這個爛玩意
I ain't having this Mass shit.

585
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,870
再也不要了  沒門
No more. No way.

586
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,460
好
Okay.

587
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,170
那么
Well...

588
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,410
或許該讓你見識一下沒有麥斯的生活
Maybe you should see what life would be like without it.

589
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,870
怎么回事
What's happening?

590
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:39,320
我在哪
Where am I?

591
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,510
海德科農場  三天前
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

592
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,240
我都記錄了  斯崔普
I have it all logged, Stripe.

593
00:54:52,510 --> 00:54:54,620
我們可以展示你做過的任何事
We can feed you everything that you did.

594
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,210
不  不
Hey, no, no, no. No.

595
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:02,810
求求你  不要開槍
Please! Please don't shoot.

596
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:05,180
求求你  不要開槍
Please! Please! Please don't shoot.

597
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,000
-求求你  求求你  -不  不要
