1
00:00:03,613 --> 00:00:06,104
I'm telling you,
if xenon emits ultraviolet light...

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,546
...those dark-matter discoveries
must be wrong.

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,347
Yes, well, if we lived in a world where
slow-moving xenon produced light...

4
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,888
...then you'd be correct.
Also, pigs would fly...

5
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:17,117
...my derriere would produce
cotton candy...

6
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:20,626
...and The Phantom Menace
would be a timeless classic.

7
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:22,196
Oh, you're so arrogant.

8
00:00:22,365 --> 00:00:25,266
If you were a superhero,
your name would be Captain Arrogant.

9
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:28,529
And you know what your superpower
would be? Arrogance.

10
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,474
You're wrong again.
If my superpower were arrogance...

11
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:35,736
...my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

12
00:00:37,514 --> 00:00:40,278
I love watching Raj and Sheldon
try to work together, heh.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,908
Yeah. It's like if Alien and Predator
decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice.

14
00:00:45,522 --> 00:00:48,787
Has it occurred to you you're missing
the big picture? If you look...

15
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:50,289
- Penny? Penny?
- What's up?

16
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,224
Nothing. I just wanted
to make Raj stop talking.

17
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:58,027
No, no, no. He won. Suck it up.

18
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:00,302
I'd ask if you want dessert...

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,734
...but Sheldon doesn't eat dessert
on Tuesdays.

20
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:05,067
If Raj wanted something,
he couldn't tell me.

21
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,438
Howard won't order anything,
but he'll come up with some comment...

22
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,772
...involving the words "pie"
or "cheesecake."

23
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:13,780
Leonard's lactose intolerant.
He can't eat anything here...

24
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,147
...without his intestines blowing up
like a balloon animal.

25
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:21,817
- Hang on. I could have the fruit platter.
- You want the fruit platter?

26
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,288
- Does it have melon?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,586
No, I can't eat melon.

28
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:30,460
Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend
just came in for her shift.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,027
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Not since we broke up. Wow.

30
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,866
How am I gonna play this?

31
00:01:37,073 --> 00:01:40,440
Sophisticated and relaxed?
Friendly, noncommittal?

32
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,134
Cold and distant?

33
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:46,873
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

34
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,607
Hello.

35
00:01:50,186 --> 00:01:52,984
I see you decided
to go with pathetic and frightened.

36
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,721
It's one of his best moves.

37
00:02:42,739 --> 00:02:45,299
So, my dear, we meet again.

38
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:50,573
- Hello, Howard. I've missed you.
- Heh.

39
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:54,478
I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.

40
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,977
- One question.
- Anything.

41
00:02:57,153 --> 00:03:00,316
Why am I wearing my
Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?

42
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:03,422
Why are you in bed with me?

43
00:03:03,626 --> 00:03:06,891
I mean, if we start to question this,
it all falls apart.

44
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,721
Sorry.

45
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:14,496
Oh, ravish me, Howard.
My loins ache for you.

46
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,835
Okay, if you insist.

47
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:21,605
Howard, have you seen my girdle?

48
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:22,870
No, Ma!

49
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:26,948
I can't find it, and I'm late
for my Weight Watchers meeting!

50
00:03:27,684 --> 00:03:30,517
Maybe it committed suicide!
Leave me alone!

51
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:34,715
Now, where were we?

52
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:38,156
I believe you were about to rip off
my uniform with your teeth.

53
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,190
Bernadette. What are you doing here?

54
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:46,028
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here
because you saw me this evening...

55
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:48,534
...and you're still hung up on me.
- No, I'm not.

56
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:49,797
Clearly you are.

57
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:57,410
Otherwise, based on past experience,
we'd be done by now.

58
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:01,477
Okay, I'm a little confused here.

59
00:04:01,684 --> 00:04:03,982
Oh, my. Can I help?

60
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:10,486
- Not that kind of confused.
- What's George Takei doing here?

61
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:13,059
Howard, do you have latent
homosexual tendencies?

62
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,893
- Of course not.
- So you say, yet here I am.

63
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,401
George, let me ask you something.

64
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:26,667
How did you deal with being typecast
as a science-fiction icon?

65
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:31,576
It's difficult. You try and stretch
as an actor, do Strindberg, O'Neill...

66
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:35,616
...but all they want is,
"Course laid in, captain."

67
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:40,181
Tell me about it. It's frakking frustrating.

68
00:04:40,356 --> 00:04:42,620
Wait, Katee. Why are you leaving?

69
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,818
She's leaving
because you really wanna be with me.

70
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:50,864
Howard,
I found my girdle! It was in the dryer!

71
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,092
Great, Ma!

72
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:53,633
I think it shrunk!

73
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:58,433
I'm spilling out
like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

74
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:03,341
And with that mental picture,
I think we're done for the evening.

75
00:05:08,985 --> 00:05:11,818
You never told me what happened
between you and Bernadette.

76
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:15,617
- I did a stupid thing, heh.
- Yeah, I guessed that.

77
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:19,886
It was the kind of thing that makes it
kind of hard to face her now, heh.

78
00:05:20,563 --> 00:05:25,023
That covers anything from farting in bed
to killing a homeless guy.

79
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:29,329
Oh, my God, you ran over a hobo.

80
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,632
No. And stop asking.

81
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:33,833
Fine. You wanna get back
together with her.

82
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,468
You're too ashamed to face her
because of whatever it is you did.

83
00:05:37,647 --> 00:05:40,480
- In a nutshell.
- Okay, well, how about this?

84
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,551
Kidnap Bernadette from the opera
wearing a creepy mask...

85
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,915
...so she doesn't know it's you.

86
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,923
Now, you see,
I don't know if you're kidding or not.

87
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:54,395
You're being unreasonable.
Why can't I have a desk?

88
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,897
Our collaboration is a work of the mind.
We don't need desks.

89
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,160
- You have a desk.
- Correct.

90
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:02,998
- But I can't have one.
- You're two for two.

91
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,565
- Why can't he have a desk?
- Oh, Lord, will this day never end?

92
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:09,712
As I've explained repeatedly
to Dr. Koothrappali...

93
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,370
...whose ability to comprehend
the American idiom...

94
00:06:12,548 --> 00:06:16,075
...fails him when it's convenient,
there's no money in my budget...

95
00:06:16,252 --> 00:06:17,947
...for additional office furniture.

96
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,589
Oh. But there's money
for a drawer full of Red Vines...

97
00:06:20,757 --> 00:06:22,418
...a marshmallow-shooting rifle...

98
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,050
...and a super-executive ant farm
with glow-in-the-dark sand?

99
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,325
Yes.

100
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,600
- What if he buys his own desk?
- What if I buy my own desk?

101
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,236
- That's ridiculous.
- Why?

102
00:06:34,403 --> 00:06:35,893
Because...

103
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:41,437
Yes?

104
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,374
- It's my office.

105
00:06:44,747 --> 00:06:46,647
- Sheldon.
- All right, all right.

106
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,841
- He can buy his own desk.
- And I can put it in your office?

107
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,815
Well, you really wanna dot the I's...

108
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:54,980
...and cross the T's, don't you?
- Why would you want...

109
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:58,753
...a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
- They do their best work at night.

110
00:07:05,535 --> 00:07:06,559
Ah, it's okay.

111
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:10,470
Penny.

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,335
Penny.

113
00:07:12,508 --> 00:07:14,135
Penny.

114
00:07:20,249 --> 00:07:22,114
Penny.

115
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,352
Would you have opened the door
if you knew it was me?

116
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:30,424
Not since I found out the teddy bear
you gave me had a webcam in it.

117
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:36,124
I just have a question.
Uh, does Bernadette ever talk about me?

118
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:37,766
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- She does?

119
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:41,836
Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked,
"Why is Howard hiding under the table?"

120
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,132
- She saw that, huh?
- Oh, no, not at first.

121
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:47,401
Right after I pointed it out.

122
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:51,309
Let me ask you something else.
Is she seeing anybody?

123
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,970
Uh, not that I know of.

124
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,879
While we're on the subject,
why did you guys break up, anyway?

125
00:07:56,052 --> 00:07:58,953
- Oh. I'd rather not say, heh.
- Howard, if you want my help...

126
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,715
...I've gotta know what happened.
- It's embarrassing.

127
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,358
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.

128
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:08,962
Okay, well,
you know "World of Warcraft"?

129
00:08:09,131 --> 00:08:10,621
The online game? Sure.

130
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,267
Well, did you know...

131
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:15,563
...that the characters in the game
can have sex with each other?

132
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,076
Oh, God.
I think I see where this is going.

133
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,535
Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

134
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:27,714
Bernadette walked in on me...

135
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:31,980
...while we were doing the cyber-nasty
under the Bridge of Souls.

136
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:36,018
Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.

137
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,256
- Would you talk to her?
- Bernadette or the troll?

138
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:44,863
Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she
wouldn't listen to my side of the story.

139
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,331
Well, what was your side?

140
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,494
For all we know, Glissinda the Troll
wasn't even a real woman.

141
00:08:49,672 --> 00:08:53,768
She could've been
a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.

142
00:08:54,477 --> 00:08:57,537
Really?
And that didn't make her feel better?

143
00:08:58,414 --> 00:08:59,438
Will you talk to her?

144
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,516
See if there's any chance
we could get back together?

145
00:09:02,685 --> 00:09:05,586
Uh, gee, Howard, I really don't wanna
get in the middle of this.

146
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:07,518
No. Why would you?

147
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,524
I'm just another lonely nerd
living with his mother...

148
00:09:11,694 --> 00:09:15,425
...trying to find
any scrap of happiness he can.

149
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:19,295
Maybe to make up for the fact
that his dad left them when he was 11.

150
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:21,802
Okay, I will think about it.

151
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:25,633
You know, I've always blamed myself
for him leaving.

152
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:29,266
I always thought it was
because I wasn't the son he wanted.

153
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,707
I said I'd think about it.

154
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,371
I wasn't athletic.
Yeah, I was kind of sickly...

155
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:36,916
Okay, fine.
Look, look, I'm calling her now. See?

156
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,246
Thank you.

157
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,786
Howard asked Penny
to talk to Bernadette, and she did.

158
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,485
Bernadette agreed to meet him
for a cup of coffee.

159
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:47,959
- One question.
- Yeah?

160
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,156
Why on earth
are you telling me all this?

161
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,333
I don't know. Sometimes
your movements are so lifelike...

162
00:09:55,538 --> 00:09:58,132
...I forget you're not a real boy.

163
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:22,355
You said I could buy a desk.

164
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:28,333
This isn't a desk.
This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.

165
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:33,207
Is that the American idiom
for "giant, big-ass desk"?

166
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,039
It's actually British.

167
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:39,273
- Can you say it again for me?
- Brobdingnagian.

168
00:10:39,648 --> 00:10:42,674
- One more time.
- Brobdingnagian.

169
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:46,879
- Now three times fast.
- Brobdingnagian. Brobdingna...

170
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,417
How did you even get it in here?

171
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:54,495
That's for me, Ramone, Julio, Jesus,
and Rodrigo to know...

172
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:56,221
...and you to find out.

173
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,768
All right, you've made your point.

174
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,029
A fine prank. Very amusing. Ha-ha-ha.

175
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,105
Now get it out.

176
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:07,373
- No.
- Yes.

177
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,443
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

178
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:13,104
I have three brothers and two sisters,
Sheldon. I can do this all day.

179
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:17,484
All right, if you're not going to
remove it, I'll remove it for you.

180
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,416
Knock yourself out.

181
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,632
- Help me move my desk.
- No.

182
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:35,998
- Yes. Yes.
- No. No.

183
00:11:36,172 --> 00:11:38,367
It's too Brobdingnagian.

184
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,037
Why do you even want this here?

185
00:11:42,211 --> 00:11:45,271
Its size is completely disproportionate
to its purpose.

186
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:49,612
Well, seeing as its purpose was
to piss you off, I'd say it's spot-on.

187
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:54,420
All right, I see what's going on.

188
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,219
This is the opening salvo
in what will be an escalating series...

189
00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:03,457
...of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.
Well titted.

190
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:07,432
- Thank you.
- Stand by for my upcoming tat.

191
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:09,571
- Hey, Sheldon?
- Yes?

192
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,433
No.

193
00:12:11,874 --> 00:12:13,808
See what I did there? I turned it around.

194
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:24,848
- Sorry. I had to clock out.
- Oh, no, that's okay. Ahem.

195
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,456
- How have you been?
- Okay. You know, busy. School, work.

196
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:29,989
- You?
- Same.

197
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,423
I took a scuba-diving course
over the summer...

198
00:12:32,595 --> 00:12:35,826
...but it turns out
I'm terrified of the ocean.

199
00:12:36,665 --> 00:12:37,689
That's too bad.

200
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,700
You wouldn't know anybody who
wants to buy a wet suit? Boys' large.

201
00:12:43,772 --> 00:12:45,672
Yeah, forget it. Not important.

202
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:48,833
Ahem. So are you seeing anyone?

203
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:51,604
- To be honest...
- Hey, how are we doing over here?

204
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,010
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Uh, not for me.

205
00:12:54,183 --> 00:12:55,946
- I'm okay.
- Are you gonna order food?

206
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,710
- Maybe later.
- Okay.

207
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,445
- So are you seeing anybody?
- No.

208
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:04,320
That's what I told him when
he asked me. I hope that's not out of line.

209
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,360
- No, it's fine.
- Heh, Penny, can we have a little privacy?

210
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,021
- Oh, heh, I'm sorry.
- Heh.

211
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,962
What about you?
Have you been seeing anybody?

212
00:13:15,137 --> 00:13:19,540
Well, I mean, you know how it is
with guys. We have needs, and... Heh.

213
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,769
- So you've been seeing other girls?
- Well, uh, not real girls.

214
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,746
Does that mean slutty trolls?

215
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:31,181
You look thirsty.
I brought you some iced tea.

216
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,913
- Thank you.
- It's passion fruit. New on the menu.

217
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:35,886
- I know. I work here.
- Oh.

218
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,261
Yeah, you're right. Doy.
So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?

219
00:13:42,231 --> 00:13:45,894
- Isn't there somewhere else you can be?
- Not where I can hear you guys.

220
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,730
Okay, fine. Look, I'll admit, heh...

221
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:55,172
...there are dark, sordid little corners
of the Internet...

222
00:13:55,344 --> 00:13:59,280
...where the name Wolowizard
is whispered in hushed tones.

223
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:03,708
But the only reason I go there,
the only reason I've ever gone there...

224
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,980
...is because I don't have a real woman
in my life.

225
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,984
- You happy?
- Yeah. That'll hold me for a while.

226
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,890
Howard, you did have a real woman.

227
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:19,797
I was right there in the next room while
you were clicking that troll's brains out.

228
00:14:22,771 --> 00:14:26,138
Yeah, but we weren't, heh...
I mean, you and I never...

229
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:28,435
- Had sex?
- Yeah.

230
00:14:28,611 --> 00:14:32,206
- Well, whose fault was that?
- Complimentary nachos.

231
00:14:33,315 --> 00:14:34,748
You enjoy.

232
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,942
Never had sex? Wow.

233
00:14:38,153 --> 00:14:40,212
What do you mean,
whose fault was that?

234
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,256
We could've been having sex,
but you never made the move.

235
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,723
I didn't think you wanted me
to make the move.

236
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:49,295
Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man
like you, with your looks...

237
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:52,491
...your fancy patter,
and your tight hoochie pants...

238
00:14:52,668 --> 00:14:56,570
...if she's not expecting him
to eventually make the move.

239
00:14:57,339 --> 00:14:59,273
- Really?
- Really.

240
00:14:59,975 --> 00:15:02,273
Son of a bitch.

241
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:04,076
This is a little awkward...

242
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:07,147
...but my manager says
I can't actually give nachos away...

243
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:10,649
...so just take that when you're ready.

244
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,783
I mean, we had a really great talk.

245
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:16,948
We're gonna start seeing
each other again.

246
00:15:17,126 --> 00:15:18,684
Oh, congratulations.

247
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:21,193
Have you broken it to the troll yet?

248
00:15:21,363 --> 00:15:25,459
- Did Penny tell you about that?
- No, Steve Patterson told me.

249
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:29,536
The greasy old fat guy
in Facilities Management?

250
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,764
- Yeah.
- How'd he know about it?

251
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,041
He's Glissinda the Troll.

252
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,946
Sorry, dude.
The thermostat's on my side of the room...

253
00:15:39,114 --> 00:15:42,606
...so it stays Mumbai hot in here until
you turn off that stupid Indian music!

254
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:46,721
I'll turn off the music when you
get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet.

255
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,881
Oh, too bad.
Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds.

256
00:15:50,092 --> 00:15:53,323
Hey, look, Sheldon.
Birdie, birdie, birdie.

257
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,895
That's it. Prepare for marshmallow death.

258
00:15:56,098 --> 00:15:57,622
Eat flaming Nerf!

259
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,435
So, anyway...

260
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:11,812
That's great news
about you and Bernadette.

261
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,642
- I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.
- Oh.

262
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:18,378
I guess, for you guys,
that's like regular golf.

263
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:22,521
Short jokes? Really? You're like
a quarter of an inch taller than me.

264
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,319
Yeah, and don't you forget it.

265
00:16:28,163 --> 00:16:30,996
- I had a good time.
- Me too.

266
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,066
Kiss her good night.

267
00:16:39,174 --> 00:16:43,406
- All right, now a little tongue.
- Hold on there.

268
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,276
We've only just rekindled the romance.

269
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:52,216
Let's not sully the moment
with the exchange of saliva.

270
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:56,750
Don't listen to him. She wants it. Tongue.

271
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,723
See?

272
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:07,702
- Now make the move.
- Mm-mm. Too soon.

273
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,862
Trust me, she's ready. Make the move.

274
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,805
No, no, no. A lady wants to be wooed...

275
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:18,538
...courted slowly.

276
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:21,446
How would you know?

277
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:24,310
I read.

278
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,813
Listen to me, Howard.
It's time. Make the move, now.

279
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:37,565
- What are you doing?
- You said... Well, the move, heh, remember?

280
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:40,167
Well, not now.
We're starting a new relationship.

281
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:44,795
- I need to get to know you again.
- No, you don't. It's me.

282
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:49,706
The lusty charmer with the fancy patter
and the hoochie pants.

283
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:53,313
Be patient. We'll get there.

284
00:18:00,756 --> 00:18:03,020
Told you.

285
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:11,355
Oh, God, what is that smell?

286
00:18:13,168 --> 00:18:14,692
Oh, oh, ooh.

287
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:17,362
Yes?

288
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,835
- What are you doing in there?
- I'm making hydrogen sulfide...

289
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,272
...and ammonia gas.

290
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,846
Just a little experiment in pest control.

291
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:29,747
It's not gonna work, dude.
I grew up in India...

292
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,284
...a subcontinent
where cows walk in the street...

293
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,922
...and nobody has ever had
a solid bowel movement.

294
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,190
Well, we'll just see
how long you can hold out.

295
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,419
We'll just see
how your noxious gas fares...

296
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:45,124
...against my cinnamon-apple-scented
aromatherapy candles.

297
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,860
Didn't you say you're making
hydrogen sulfide gas?

298
00:18:48,036 --> 00:18:49,867
- Yes.
- Isn't that flammable?

299
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:51,903
Highly.

300
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,939
Oh, dear.

301
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,345
This is not over.
