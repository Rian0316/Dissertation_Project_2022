- (BINGLEY): It's a fair prospect.
- (DARCY): Pretty enough, I grant you.


2
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:09,570
It's nothing to Pemberley, I know.


3
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,240
But I must settle somewhere.
Have I your approval?


4
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,617
You'Il find the society
something savage.


5
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,996
Country manners?
I think they're charming.


6
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:22,666
- Then you' d better take it.
- Thank you, I shall.


7
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,836
I shall close
with the attorney directly.


8
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,200
(KITTY): I want to wear it today.
Look what you've done to it!


9
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,869
(KITTY): Mamma, mamma!


10
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,997
(KITTY): Lydia has torn up my bonnet


11
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,750
and says she will wear it to church.
Tell her she shall not!


12
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:50,003
I shall wear it,
for it's all my own work.


13
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:53,131
She' d be a fright in it.
She's too plain to look well in it!


14
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,843
- No, you shall not have it!
- Lydia! Kitty! Girls!


15
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:01,265
Would you tear my nerves into shreds?
Let her have it, Kitty.


16
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,269
But it's mine! You let her have
everything that is mine!


17
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:20,242
Oh, what is to become of us all?
Jane, Lizzy, where are you?


18
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,328
- Here, mamma.
- Coming, mamma.


19
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:43,348
My dear! Mr Bennet! Wonderful news!


20
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,518
- Netherfield Park is let at last!
- Is it?


21
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:50,147
Yes, it is, for I have just had it
from Mrs Long.


22
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,441
Do you not want to know who's taken it?


23
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,736
I have no objection to hearing it.


24
00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:00,365
It is taken by a young man of large
fortune from the north of England.


25
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,243
A <i>single </i>man of large fortune, my dear.


26
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,580
He came down on Monday to see the place.


27
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,751
His name is Bingley and he will be
in possession by Michaelmas.


28
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,088
<i>And</i> he has 5,000 a year!


29
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:19,968
- What a fine thing for our girls!
- How so? How can it affect them?


30
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,387
Mr Bennet, why are you so tiresome?


31
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,557
You know that I'm thinking
of his marrying one of them.


32
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:31,229
For a single man with a good fortune
<i>must</i> be in want of a wife.


33
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:35,275
Yes, he must indeed! And who better
than one of our five girls ?

(LYDIA SNORTS)


35
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,611
Lydia!


36
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,739
- What a fine joke if he chose me!
- Or me!


37
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:45,452
So that is his design in settling here?
To marry one of our daughters?


38
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,622
"Design"? How can you talk
such nonsense?


39
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,917
But he may fall in love
with one of them.


40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,586
Therefore you must visit him
directly he comes.


41
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,631
No, no, I see no occasion for that.


42
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,008
- Mr Bennet!
- Go yourself with the girls.


43
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,928
- Still better, send them by themselves.
- By themselves?!


44
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,763
Aye, for you're as handsome
as any of them.


45
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,641
Mr Bingley might like you
best of the party.

Oh, Hill!

Hill, I am so distressed!


51
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:29,204
Mr Bennet says he will not visit
Mr Bingley when he comes.


52
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,998
- There, there.
- Can't you reason with him?


53
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:36,920
- I daresay it'Il all be well.
- No, it will not!


54
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:41,675
- For he is bent on ruining us all.
- Mamma, he's teasing you.


55
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,886
He will call on Mr Bingley.
He calls on any new neighbour.


56
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,557
Jane, how can you say that?
You heard him!


57
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,435
You know your father
has a will of iron.


58
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,353
You're in the right, my dear.


59
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:57,858
I'Il tell you what I'Il do.
I shall write to Mr Bingley,


60
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,027
informing him that
I have five daughters,


61
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:04,322
and he is welcome to any of them.


62
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,117
They're all silly and ignorant,
like other girls.


63
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,828
Well, Lizzy has more wit than the rest.


64
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,499
But he may prefer a stupid wife,
as others have done before him.


65
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,837
- There, will that do?
- No! I beg you will not write if you...


66
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,840
You take delight in vexing me!


67
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,342
You have no compassion
on my poor nerves!


68
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,888
You mistake me.
I have a high respect for your nerves.


69
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,557
They've been my old friends
for 20 years.


70
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,854
- You don't know what I suffer.
- Well, I hope you'Il get over it,


71
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:40,442
and live to see many young men
of 5,000 a year move here.


72
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:44,946
It's no use if 20 such should come,
since you won't visit them.


73
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,451
Depend upon it, my dear.
When there are 20, I'Il visit them all.


74
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:57,083
You see, Jane? He won't be
prevailed upon. He'Il see us all ruined.

If only we' d been able to have sons!

Misfortunes, we are told,
are sent to test our fortitude,


77
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:10,680
and may often reveal themselves
as blessings in disguise.


78
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,101
Lord, I'm so hungry!


79
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,615
If I could love a man
who would love me enough


80
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,785
to take me for 50 pounds a year,


81
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,621
I should be very well pleased.


82
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,747
Yes.


83
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,209
But such a man could hardly be sensible


84
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,045
and I could never love a man
who was out of his wits.


85
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,382
Oh, Lizzy.


86
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,931
A marriage... where either partner
cannot love nor respect the other,


87
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:58,103
that cannot be agreeable...
to either party.


88
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,731
As we have daily proof.


89
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:04,776
But beggars, you know,
cannot be choosers.


90
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,279
We're not <i>very</i> poor, Lizzy.


91
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:12,826
With father's estate withheld from the
female line, we have only our charms.


92
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,248
One of us at least will have
to marry <i>very</i> well.


93
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,043
And since you're five times as pretty
as the rest of us,


94
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:26,381
and have the sweetest disposition,
the task will fall on you.


95
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,466
But, Lizzy...


96
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,178
I would wish...


97
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:37,309
I should so much like...
to marry for love.


98
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:42,397
And so you shall, I'm sure.


99
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,443
Only take care you fall in love
with a man of good fortune.


100
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,113
Well, I shall try. To please you.


101
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,615
And you?


102
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:59,706
I am determined that only the deepest
love will induce me into matrimony.


103
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:05,086
So... I shall end an old maid,


104
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,089
and teach your 10 children
to embroider cushions


105
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,301
and play their instruments very ill.


106
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,650
- Good night, mamma.
- My head is very ill tonight.


107
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,488
I said, I wouldn't dance with him
if he was the last man in Meryton!


108
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,325
- Good night, Lydia. Good night, Kitty.
- Good night, Lizzy!


109
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,084
(LYDIA): Lizzy!


110
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,546
Wait till you hear our news!


111
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,595
- Mr Bingley has come!
- Sir William Lucas called on him!


113
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,808
- Save your breath. I will tell mamma.
- I don't wish to know.


114
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,437
Why care for Mr Bingley?
We'Il never be acquainted with him.


115
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,896
But, mamma!


116
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,943
Don't keep coughing so, Kitty!
Have a little compassion on my nerves.


117
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:56,573
- I don't cough for my own amusement.
- 40 servants, and he's very handsome.


118
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,118
- He declared that he loves to dance!
- He said he' d come to the next ball!


119
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,870
- At the Assembly Rooms!
- On Saturday!


120
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:05,623
- With six ladies and four gentlemen.
- It was 12 ladies and seven gentlemen.


121
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:09,335
- Too many ladies.
- Lydia, I beg you would stop!


122
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:13,214
We will never know Mr Bingley
and it pains me to hear of him.


123
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,176
- (LYDIA): But mamma!
- I'm sick of Mr Bingley!


124
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,136
I'm sorry to hear that.


125
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,348
If I' d known as much this morning,
I should never have called on him.


126
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,519
(MOTHER): You have called on him?!


127
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:30,065
I'm afraid we cannot escape
the acquaintance now.


128
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:37,030
My dear Mr Bennet!
How good you are to us.


129
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:41,493
- Well, well.
- Girls, girls, is he not a good father ?


130
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,995
And never to tell us! What a good joke!


131
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,917
And now you shall all dance
with Mr Bingley!


132
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:53,088
I hope he has a strong constitution!


133
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,632
And a fondness for silly young women.


134
00:11:55,715 --> 00:12:00,386
My dear Mr Bennet, nothing you say
shall ever vex me again.


135
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,181
I'm sorry to hear it. Well, Kitty.


136
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,976
I think you may cough as much
as you choose now.


137
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:51,980
- Shall we be quite safe here, Mr Darcy?
- Damned silly way to spend an evening.


138
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,132
Mr Bingley!


139
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:06,346
Allow me the pleasure of welcoming
you to our little assembly.


140
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,265
Sir William, I am very glad to see you.


141
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:13,353
There's nothing that I love better
than a country dance.


142
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,200
- Do you know who the two ladies are?
- Mr Bingley's sisters, I understand.


143
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,245
One is married to that gentleman,
Mr Hurst.


144
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,538
- The taller gentleman?
- No, the other.


145
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,749
(ELIZABETH): Better and better!


146
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,876
Very elegant.


147
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,129
Better pleased with themselves
than what they see, I think.


148
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,967
Lizzy! Jane! Come here!


149
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:54,352
You see that gentleman? Lady Lucas
says he is Mr Bingley's oldest friend.


150
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,146
His name is Darcy and he has
a mighty fortune


151
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,649
and a great estate in Derbyshire.


152
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,944
Bingley's wealth is nothing to his!


153
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,030
10,000 a year! At least!


154
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,952
Don't you think he's the handsomest
man you've ever seen, girls?


155
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,706
I wonder if he' d be as handsome
if he weren't so rich.


156
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,878
Oh, Lizzy! They're coming over.
Smile, girls! Smile!


157
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,090
Mrs Bennet.


158
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:29,012
Mr Bingley would want to become
acquainted with you and your daughters.


159
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,098
Sir, that is very good of you.


160
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,854
This is Jane, my eldest.


161
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,733
And Elizabeth. And Mary sits over there.


162
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:46,696
And Kitty and Lydia, my youngest,
you see there dancing.


163
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:55,997
- Do you like to dance yourself?
- There is nothing I love better, madam.


164
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,916
If Miss Bennet is not otherwise engaged,


165
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,628
may I be so bold as to claim
the next two dances ?


166
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,007
- I am not engaged, sir.
- Good.


167
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,762
You do us great honour, sir.
Thank the gentleman, Jane.


168
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,222
Mamma.


169
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,310
And you, sir ?
Are you fond of dancing, too?


170
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:22,565
Oh, I beg your pardon. Mrs Bennet,
may I present my friend, Mr Darcy?


171
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:27,320
You are very welcome to Hertfordshire
I am sure, sir.


172
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,407
I hope you have come here
eager to dance, as your friend has?


173
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,203
Thank you, madam. I rarely dance.


174
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:37,997
Let this be one of the occasions, sir,


175
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:44,003
for I wager you'Il not easily find such
lively music or such pretty partners.


176
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,262
Pray, excuse me, ma'am.


177
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,520
Well! Did you ever meet such a proud
disagreeable man!


178
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,398
- He will hear you.
- I don't care if he does.


179
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:08,694
And his friend disposed to be
so agreeable and everything charming.


180
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:12,407
(MOTHER): Who is he to think himself
so far above his company?


181
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,535
The very rich can afford to give offence
wherever they go.


182
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,288
- We need not care for his good opinion.
- No, indeed!


183
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,709
Perhaps he's not so very handsome
after all?


184
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:28,047
No, indeed! Quite ill-favoured.


185
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,801
(MOTHER): Certainly nothing at all to
Mr Bingley!


186
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,051
I'Il show them!


187
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:16,280
I wonder at Kitty and Lydia,
that they are so fond of dancing.


188
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:18,741
(MARY): I take little pleasure
in a ball.


189
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,159
(ELIZABETH): I would take pleasure,


190
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,621
if there were enough partners
as agreeable as Jane's.


191
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:29,293
I believe the rewards of observation
and reflection are much greater.


192
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:32,255
Y es, when there are none others
to be had.


193
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,341
We shall have to be philosophers, Mary.


194
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:55,319
Come, Darcy, I must have you dance!


195
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:58,781
I must. I hate to see you standing about
in this stupid manner!


196
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,075
Y ou had much better dance!


197
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,540
I certainly shall not. At an assembly
such as this? It would be insupportable.


198
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,005
Your sisters are engaged.


199
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:19,218
(DARCY): You know it would punish me
to stand up with any other woman.


200
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:23,723
Good God, Darcy! I wouldn't be
as fastidious as you are for a kingdom!


201
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:27,893
(BINGLEY): Upon my honour, I never met
so many pleasant girls in my life!


202
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,980
Several of them uncommonly pretty.


203
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:35,526
You have been dancing
with the only handsome girl in the room.


204
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:41,115
Darcy, she is the most
beautiful creature I ever beheld.


205
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,493
Look, look!


206
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,623
(BINGLEY): There's one of her sisters.
She's very pretty too.


207
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,250
(BINGLEY): I daresay very agreeable.


208
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:56,756
(DARCY): She's tolerable, I suppose,
but not handsome enough to tempt me.


209
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,553
I'm in no humour to consider young
ladies who are slighted by other men.


210
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,388
Go back to your partner.
Enjoy her smiles.


211
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,682
You're wasting your time on me.


212
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:25,219
Jane was so admired!


213
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,972
There was nothing like it!


214
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:32,435
- Oh, Lord! I'm so fagged!
- Lydia and I danced every dance.


215
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,395
And Mary none!


216
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:39,358
And Mr Bingley favoured Jane
above every other girl.


217
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,652
For he danced the first two with her,


218
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:45,197
and then the next with Charlotte Lucas,
which vexed me greatly,


219
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:48,784
but lo, there in the very next nothing
would please him


220
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,703
but to stand up with Jane again.


221
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:54,707
And then he danced with Lizzy,
and what do you think he did next?


222
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:59,378
Enough, madam! For God's sake!
Let's hear no more of his partners!


223
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,756
Would he had sprained his ankle
in the first dance!


224
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,594
And his sisters! Oh,
such charming women!


225
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,055
So elegant and obliging!
I wish you had seen them.


226
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:16,228
- The lace on Mrs Hurst's gown...
- No lace, Mrs Bennet, I beg you.


227
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,858
But the man he brought with him!
'Mr Darcy' , as he calls himself,


228
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:26,238
is not worth our concern, though he
may be the richest man in Derbyshire.


229
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:30,409
The proudest,
<i>the</i> most horrid, disobliging...


230
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:35,080
He slighted poor Lizzy,
and flatly refused to stand up with her.


231
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,500
Slighted my Lizzy, did he?


232
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,377
I didn't care for him either,
so it's of little matter.


233
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:44,924
Another time, Lizzy, I would not dance
with him if he should ask you.


234
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:50,012
I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise
you <i>never</i> to dance with Mr Darcy.


235
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,270
So none of the Hertfordshire ladies
could please you, Mr Darcy?


236
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,857
Not even the famous Miss Bennets ?


237
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,778
I never met with pleasanter people
or prettier girls!


238
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,115
You astonish me. I saw little beauty,
and no breeding at all.


239
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:13,619
The eldest Miss Bennet is,
I grant you, very pretty.


240
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:18,082
A fine concession!
Admit it, she's an angel!


241
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,669
- She smiles too much.
- Jane Bennet is a sweet girl.


242
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,547
But the mother!


243
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,176
I heard Eliza Bennet described
as a famous local beauty.


244
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,970
What do you say to that, Mr Darcy?


245
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:33,222
I should as soon call her mother a wit.


246
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,850
That's too cruel!


247
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,105
I don't understand why you
go through the world


248
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,609
determined to be displeased
with everything and everyone.


249
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:50,990
I will never understand why you approve
of everything and everyone you meet.


250
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,993
Y ou shall not make me think ill
of Miss Bennet.


251
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:57,454
Indeed he shall not!
I shall dare his disapproval


252
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,748
and declare she is a dear sweet girl,


253
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,959
despite her unfortunate relations,


254
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,836
and I should not be sorry to know
her better!


255
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,091
No, nor I! You see, Mr Darcy,
<i>we</i> are not afraid of you.


256
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:11,218
I would not have you so.


257
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:13,262
(SNORING)


258
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:18,267
What? Aye, very true.
Damned tedious waste of an evening.


259
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,354
(JANE): He's just what a young man
ought to be.


260
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:28,360
Sensible, lively, and I never saw
such happy manners!


261
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:31,906
Handsome too, which a young man
ought to be if he possibly can.


262
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:35,367
He seems to like you very much,
which shows good judgement.


263
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:38,662
You may like him.
You've liked many a stupider person.


264
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,372
Dear Lizzy!


265
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,542
He could be happier in his choice
of sisters and friends.


266
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,253
- But the sisters he cannot help.
- Did you not like them?


267
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:49,798
Not at all. Their manners
are quite different from his.


268
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,469
At first, perhaps, but after a while
they were pleasing.


269
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:57,723
Miss Bingley is to keep house.
They will be very charming neighbours.


270
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:02,561
- One of them maybe.
- No, Lizzy, I'm sure you're wrong.


271
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:06,398
Even Mr Darcy may improve
on closer acquaintance.


272
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,736
Will he be in humour to consider young
ladies who are slighted by other men?


273
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,821
Never!


274
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,450
"She is tolerable, I suppose,


275
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,912
but not handsome enough to tempt <i>me.</i>"


276
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:24,625
- It was very wrong of him to speak so.
- Indeed it was!


277
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,627
Capital offence!


278
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,880
Oh, look! Charlotte is come.


279
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,258
Charlotte!


280
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:37,930
Lizzy! My father is to give a party
at Lucas Lodge and you are all invited!


281
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:48,107
I hope Lucas Lodge will be graced
with your presence on many occasions.


282
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,444
Here, you see, we are all easy
with no awkwardness or ceremony.


283
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,862
Quite.


284
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:58,158
Oh, yes, my dear. 5,000 a year!


285
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:03,539
(MOTHER): Don't they look well together?
A most agreeable young man!


286
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,513
And he would dance every dance
with Jane. Nothing else would do!


287
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,683
Are you pleased with Hertfordshire,
Colonel Forster ?


288
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,811
Very much, Lady Lucas.
Especially this evening.


289
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:29,148
A regiment of infantry doesn't find
a ready welcome everywhere.


290
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,985
I think your officers will be very well
pleased with Meryton.


291
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,695
(LAUGHTER)


292
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,741
Denny and Sanderson
seem well pleased already!


293
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:43,412
No doubt you attend assemblies
at St. James's Court?


294
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,875
- We go but rarely, sir.
- Indeed! I am surprised.


295
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:53,338
I should be happy to introduce you
there at any time when I'm in town.


296
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,966
You're too kind, sir.


297
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,720
Well! Well!


298
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:02,097
Good, good.


299
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,725
Capital! Capital!


300
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:10,522
Insufferable conceit! To imagine that we
would need his assistance in society.


301
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,525
I am sure he is a good sort of man,
Caroline.


302
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,195
And I am sure he kept a good sort
of shop


303
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,614
before his elevation to the Knighthood.


304
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,370
Poor Darcy. What agonies he must
be suffering.


305
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:48,185
Are you in Meryton to subdue
the discontented populace, sir,


306
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,687
or to defend Hertfordshire
against the French ?


307
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:54,483
Neither, ma'am. We hope
to winter peacefully at Meryton.


308
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,568
My soldiers
are in great need of training


309
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:59,655
and my officers
in ever great need of society.


310
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:03,659
When you are settled,
I hope you'Il give a ball.


311
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,246
- Oh, yes, my dear, do!
- Would a ball be well received?


312
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:11,375
Who's giving a ball? I long for a ball,
and so does Denny!


313
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:15,504
- And Sanderson. Don't you?
- I d-do indeed.


314
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,924
- Most passionately.
- Little Sanderson, I knew you would!


315
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,427
Make him give a ball!
We'Il dance with all the officers.


316
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,931
If Mary would play something,
we could dance now!


317
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:30,435
Mary, no more dull stuff,
play something jolly. We want to dance!


318
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:35,440
But there are still two movements.
Mamma! T ell them it isn't fair!


319
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,237
Oh, play a jig, Mary.
No one wants your concertos here.


320
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:45,868
I fear their taste is not as fine
as yours and mine, Mary,


321
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,828
but let's oblige them this once.


322
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,707
There is no one here
who plays as well as you!


323
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,961
Very well. Though you know it gives me
little pleasure.


324
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,257
- Jane, Mr Bingley, come and dance!
- Not now, Lydia.


325
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,467
(SIR WILLIAM): Capital! Capital!


326
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:17,482
Mr Bingley continues his attentions
to Jane, Lizzy.


327
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:25,240
- I'm very happy for her, Charlotte.
- She seems well pleased with him.


328
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:28,577
If he continues so, she's in a fair way
to be in love with him.


329
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:32,748
And Mr Bingley?
Do you think he is in love?


330
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:36,084
It's clear that he likes her very much.


331
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,962
Then she should leave him in no doubt.


332
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,673
She should show more affection
than she feels,


333
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:44,343
not less, if she is to secure him.


334
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:49,681
- "Secure him"? Charlotte.
- Y es, she should secure him soon!


335
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:55,103
Before she is sure of his character
and certain of her own regard for him?


336
00:30:55,187 --> 00:31:00,234
But of course! Happiness in marriage
is entirely a matter of chance.


337
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,362
There will always be vexation and grief.


338
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,573
It's better to know in advance
as little as possible


339
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,700
of the defects of your partner.


340
00:31:08,784 --> 00:31:10,661
Is it not?


341
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,830
You would never act like that yourself!


342
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,083
Well, it seems that Jane will not.


343
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,252
So we must hope that Mr Bingley will.


344
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,547
He gets little encouragement
from his sisters.


345
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,008
(ELIZABETH): Or his friend.


346
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,225
- Mr Darcy looks at you a great deal.
- I can't think why!


347
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,228
Unless to frighten me with his contempt.


348
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:40,649
I wish he would not come into society.
He only makes people uneasy.


349
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:45,988
What a charming amusement
for young people this is!


350
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,073
Nothing like dancing!


351
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,201
A refinement of every polished society.


352
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:54,871
- And every unpolished society.
- Sir ?


353
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:57,582
Every savage can dance.


354
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,168
Oh, yes. Yes, quite.


355
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:07,801
I should speak to my sister
before she exposes us all to ridicule.


356
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,595
(SIR WILLIAM): Capital! Capital!


357
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:16,310
Miss Eliza! Why are you not dancing?


358
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:19,104
Mr Darcy, allow me to present
this young lady


359
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,065
to you as a very desirable partner.


360
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,737
You cannot refuse to dance, I'm sure,
when so much beauty is before you.


361
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,948
Indeed, sir. I have not
the least intention of dancing.


362
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:34,619
Please don't suppose that I moved
this way in order to beg for a partner.


363
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:38,332
I would be happy if you would dance
with me, Miss Bennet.


364
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,791
Thank you.


365
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,628
But excuse me,
I... am not inclined to dance.


366
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,466
Why not, when you see Mr Darcy
has no objection?


367
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,136
Although he dislikes the amusement
in general.


368
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,306
- Mr Darcy is all politeness.
- He is!


369
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,642
And why should he not be,
considering the inducement?


370
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:01,063
Who could object to such a partner ?
Eh, Darcy?


371
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,190
I beg you would excuse me.


372
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:08,278
Well, well...
Oh, Capital, Lydia! Capital!


373
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:17,913
I believe I can guess your thoughts
at this moment.


374
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,749
I should imagine not.


375
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,669
You are thinking how insupportable
it would be


376
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,507
to spend many evenings
in such tedious company.


377
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:34,221
My mind was more agreeably engaged.
I've been meditating on the pleasure,


378
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:39,142
which a pair of fine eyes in the face
of a pretty woman can bestow.


379
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:46,566
And may one dare ask whose are the eyes
that inspired these reflections?


380
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,777
Miss Elizabeth Bennet's.


381
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,908
Miss Elizabeth Bennet?


382
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,080
I am all astonishment.


383
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,798
From Netherfield! Oh, Jane!
Well, what does it say?


384
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:15,429
- It is from Miss Bingley.
- Oh, well, that is a good sign, too.


385
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,764
Give it to me.


386
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,726
"My dear friend!"


387
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,228
There now!


388
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,523
"Dine with Louisa and me today... "


389
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:30,068
La di da, la di da, la di da,
la di da...


390
00:34:30,152 --> 00:34:34,197
" ..as the gentlemen are to dine
with the officers. " That's unlucky!


391
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,867
Still, you must go and make
what you can of it.


392
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:41,746
"Yours ever, Caroline Bingley. "
Very elegant hand!


393
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,126
- May I have the carriage, father?
- (MOTHER): The carriage! No, indeed.


394
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,296
You must go on horseback,
for it looks like rain.


395
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:52,632
- Then you will have to stay the night.
- Mother!


396
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,093
Why do you look at me like that?


397
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:58,555
Would you go there without seeing
Mr Bingley?


398
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,265
No, indeed.


399
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,727
You will go on Nellie.
That will do very well indeed!


400
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,454
There, Lizzy. You see?


401
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:26,333
It is all exactly as I planned.


402
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:46,853
Now... let me see
if I've got this right, Jane.


403
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:51,149
Your mother's sister is named
Mrs Philips?


404
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:55,737
- Y es.
- And Mr Philips' estate is...?


405
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,573
He lives in Meryton.


406
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,910
He's an attorney.


407
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:09,584
And your mother's brother lives
in London?


408
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:13,213
Y es. In Gracechurch Street.


409
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:18,510
In which part of London
is Gracechurch Street, Jane?


410
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,220
I...


411
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,431
Forgive me, I...


412
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,521
Fosset, get help. Miss Bennet is unwell.


413
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:38,196
Well, my dear, if Jane should die
of this fever,


414
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,658
it will be comfort to know that
it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley,


415
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,368
and under your orders.


416
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:49,082
Oh, nonsense! People do not die
of little trifling colds.


417
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:53,587
- She will be very well taken care of.
- I think I must go to Netherfield.


418
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,131
(MOTHER): No, there's no call for that!


419
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,800
Jane is very well where she is.


420
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,386
And you know there is nothing
for you there.


421
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,223
Go to Meryton with your sisters
and meet the officers.


422
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:07,642
Aye, there are more than enough
to go around.


423
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,272
I know that Jane would wish me
to be with her.


424
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,234
I suppose that's a hint for me
to send for the carriage.


425
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:19,195
No, father, I' d much rather walk.


426
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:24,451
It's barely three miles to Netherfield
and I'Il be back for dinner.


427
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:29,497
Walk three miles in all that dirt?
Y ou'Il not be fit to be seen.


428
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:33,001
I shall be fit to see Jane,
which is all I want.


429
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,629
I'm quite determined, mother.


430
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:38,715
I know! Lydia and I will set you
as far as Meryton.


431
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:43,970
Aye, let's call on Denny early, before
he is dressed. What a shock he will get!


432
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,513
Ammm!


433
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,224
Our life holds few distinctions,
Mrs Bennet,


434
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:50,769
but I think we may safely boast
that here sit


435
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:53,104
two of the silliest girls
in the country.


436
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:04,449
- 'Bye, Lizzy!
- Isn't that Captain Carter ? Make haste!


437
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,619
- Miss Bennet.
- Mr Darcy.


438
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,582
I am come to enquire after my sister.


439
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:59,170
- On foot?
- As you see.


440
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,845
Would you be so kind
as to take me to her ?


441
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:38,668
Well, we must allow her to be
an excellent walker, I suppose.


442
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:43,214
But her appearance this morning!
She really looked almost wild!


443
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,508
(MISS BINGLEY): I could hardly keep
my countenance!


444
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:51,723
Scampering about the country because
her sister has a cold! Her hair, Louisa!


445
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,560
Her petticoat!
I hope you saw it, brother.


446
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,313
Six inches deep in mud, I am certain!


447
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,525
It escaped my notice.
I thought she looked remarkably well.


448
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:07,155
- You observed it, I'm sure, Mr Darcy.
- I did.


449
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,576
I'm inclined to think you wouldn't wish
your sister to make such an exhibition.


450
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,411
Certainly not.


451
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:20,251
It seems to me to show an abominable
sort of conceited independence.


452
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:23,379
It shows a pleasing affection
for her sister.


453
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:30,053
Mr Darcy, has this escapade affected
your admiration for her fine eyes?


454
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,140
Not at all. They were brightened
by the exercise.


455
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:41,189
But <i>Jane</i> Bennet is a sweet girl!


456
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,942
It's very sad
she has such an unfortunate family,


457
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:45,610
such low connections.


458
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:50,782
Their uncle, she told us, is in trade,
and lives in Cheapside!


459
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,786
Perhaps we should call,
when we are next in town.


460
00:40:56,538 --> 00:41:00,542
They' d be as agreeable, had they
uncles enough to fill all Cheapside!


461
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:05,046
With such connections they have
little chance of marrying well, Bingley.


462
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,007
<i>That</i> is the material point.


463
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:15,807
Miss Bennet, how does your sister do?
Is she any better ?


464
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,061
- I'm afraid that she is quite unwell.
- Let me send for Mr Jones.


465
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,816
- You must stay until she is recovered.
- I would not wish to inconvenience you.


466
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:29,279
I won't hear of anything else.
I'Il send to Longbourn for your clothes.


467
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:30,697
You're very kind, sir.


468
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,117
(HURST): Is there any sport today,
or not?


469
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
Get in there!


470
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,286
There. Shall I disgrace you,
do you think?


471
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:24,042
You look very pretty, Lizzy,
as you are well aware.


472
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,919
Oh, Jane.


473
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,172
I' d much rather stay here with you.


474
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,717
The Superior Sisters wish me miles away.


475
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,013
Only your Mr Bingley is civil
and attentive.


476
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:41,643
- He's not <i>my</i> Mr Bingley.
- Oh, I think he is.


477
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,147
Or he very soon will be.


478
00:42:57,742 --> 00:43:01,621
I believe you will find Mr Bingley
is in the drawing room, ma'am.


479
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:03,581
Thank you.


480
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:41,536
Mr Darcy, come and advise me.
Mr Hurst carries all before him!


481
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,329
- Ha!
- Ooh!


482
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,964
May I enquire after your sister,
Miss Bennet?


483
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:56,300
Thank you.
I believe she's a little better.


484
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,677
I am very glad to hear it.


485
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:02,015
- Mr Hurst, I'm quite undone!
- (HURST): Should have played the deuce.


486
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,184
(MISS BINGLEY): He's undone us all,
Mr Darcy!


487
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,732
- Will you join us, Miss Bennet?
- I thank you, no.


488
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:14,318
You prefer reading to cards? Singular!


489
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:17,739
Miss Bennet despises cards.
She's a great reader


490
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,450
and has no pleasure in anything else.


491
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:24,328
I deserve neither such praise
nor such censure.


492
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:28,624
I am not a great reader
and take pleasure in many things.


493
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,005
And what do you do so secretly, sir ?


494
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,678
It's no secret.
I'm writing to my sister.


495
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,307
(MISS BINGLEY): Dear Georgiana!
I long to see her!


496
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:48,770
Is she much grown since the Spring?
Is she as tall as me?


497
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:55,276
She's now about Miss Elizabeth
Bennet's height, or a little taller.


498
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,656
And so accomplished! Her performance
at the pianoforte is exquisite!


499
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,410
- Do you play, Miss Bennet?
- Aye, but very ill indeed.


500
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:08,873
All young ladies are accomplished!
They sing, they draw, they dance,


501
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:13,836
speak French and German, cover screens,
and I know not what!


502
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,131
Not half a dozen would satisfy me
as accomplished.


503
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:21,260
(MISS BINGLEY): Certainly! No woman
can be esteemed accomplished,


504
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,889
who does not also possess a certain
something in her air,


505
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,892
in the manner of walking,
in the tone of her voice,


506
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,645
her address and expressions.


507
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,565
(DARCY): And to this she must yet add
something more substantial,


508
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:38,111
in the improvement of her mind
by extensive reading.


509
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:44,242
I'm no longer surprised at you knowing
only six accomplished women.


510
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,536
I wonder at your knowing any.


511
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,872
(MRS HURST): You're severe upon
your sex, Miss Bennet.


512
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,250
(ELIZABETH): I must speak as I find.


513
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:57,380
Perhaps you haven't had the advantage
of moving in society enough.


514
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:01,926
There are many very accomplished
young ladies amongst our acquaintance.


515
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,806
(HURST): Come, come! This is a fine
way to play cards! You're all light!


516
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,775
Look, girls! Is it not a fair prospect?


517
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:34,083
And now the mother! Are we to be invaded
by every Bennet in the country?


518
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:36,752
It's too much to be borne!


519
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:47,471
Mrs Bennet! Welcome! I hope you don't
find Miss Bennet worse than expected.


520
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:52,226
Indeed I do, sir! She's very ill indeed,
and suffers a vast deal,


521
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,478
though with the greatest patience
in the world,


522
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:57,315
for she has the sweetest temper.


523
00:46:57,398 --> 00:47:00,526
But she is much too ill to be moved.


524
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,988
We must trespass a little longer
on your kindness.


525
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,324
But of course!


526
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:10,494
Miss Bennet will receive every possible
attention, I assure you.


527
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,539
You are very good.


528
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:17,376
Well, you have a sweet room here!


529
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,172
I think you will never want
to leave Netherfield.


530
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,841
I' d be happy to live
in the country forever.


531
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,218
Wouldn't you, Darcy?


532
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:30,681
You would? You don't find the society
somewhat confined and unvarying?


533
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:34,769
Confined and unvarying?
Indeed it is not, sir!


534
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,313
The country is a vast deal pleasanter
than town,


535
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,233
whatever you may say about it!


536
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:44,820
Mamma, you mistake Mr Darcy's meaning.


537
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:48,407
Do I? He seems to think the country
nothing at all!


538
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:50,785
- Mamma.
- Confined, unvarying!


539
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,830
I would have him know
we dine with 24 families!


540
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,209
(GIGGLES)


541
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,801
Mamma? Have you seen Charlotte Lucas
since I came away?


542
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,595
Yes, she called yesterday
with Sir William.


543
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,056
What an agreeable man he is!


544
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,684
<i>That </i>is my idea of good breeding.


545
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,061
Those persons who fancy themselves


546
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,814
very important,
and never open their mouths,


547
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,400
quite mistake the matter.


548
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,530
Mr Bingley, did you not promise a ball
when you were settled here?


549
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,616
It will be a scandal if you don't
keep your word.


550
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,952
I am perfectly ready to keep
my engagement.


551
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:34,745
When your sister is recovered,


552
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:37,331
you shall name the day of the ball,
if you please.


553
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,503
There, now, Lydia!
That's a fair promise for you!


554
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:45,006
That's generosity for you!


555
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,178
That's what I call
gentlemanly behaviour!


556
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,543
Miss Eliza Bennet.


557
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,795
Let me persuade you to follow my example


558
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,132
and take a turn about the room.
It's so refreshing!


559
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,980
Will you not join us, Mr Darcy?


560
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:10,901
- That would defeat the object.
- What do you mean, sir ?


561
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,486
What can he mean ?


562
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,072
I think we would do better
not to enquire.


563
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,242
Nay, we insist on knowing
your meaning, sir!


564
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,871
That your figures are to best advantage
when walking,


565
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:24,957
and that I might best admire them
from here.


566
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,252
Shocking! Abominable reply!


567
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:34,175
- How shall we punish him, Miss Eliza?
- Nothing so easy. Tease him.


568
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:38,637
- Laugh at him.
- Laugh at Mr Darcy?


569
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,474
Impossible!


570
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:45,644
- He is a man without fault.
- Is he indeed?


571
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:48,814
A man without fault?


572
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:52,359
That is not possible for anyone.


573
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:57,490
But it has been my study to avoid
those weaknesses which expose ridicule.


574
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:02,828
Such as vanity, perhaps, and pride?


575
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.


576
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,794
(DARCY): But pride...


577
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:16,926
Where there is a superiority of mind,
pride will always be under regulation.


578
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:22,598
I have faults, but I hope they're not
of understanding.


579
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,851
My temper I cannot vouch for.


580
00:52:29,814 --> 00:52:32,483
It might be called resentful.


581
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,361
My good opinion, once lost,
is lost forever.


582
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:40,741
That is a failing indeed,
but I cannot laugh at it.


583
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:46,497
I believe every disposition
has a tendency to some evil.


584
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,583
Your defect is a propensity
to hate everyone.


585
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:52,044
Yours is wilfully to misunderstand them.


586
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,462
Some music?


587
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,151
Give your parents
my warmest salutations.


588
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:20,239
Your father is most welcome to shoot
with us at any time convenient.


589
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:22,741
Thank you, sir. You are very kind.


590
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:25,744
Goodbye.


591
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,038
Goodbye.


592
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,461
Drive on, Rossiter.


593
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:49,268
(MISS BINGLEY): How pleasant it is
to have one's house to oneself again!


594
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,106
But I fear Mr Darcy is mourning the loss


595
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:58,569
of Miss Eliza Bennet's pert opinions
and fine eyes.


596
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:03,490
Quite the contrary, I assure you.


597
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,708
(ELIZABETH): Oh, Jane!


598
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,921
I'm sorry to say it, but notwithstanding
your excellent Mr Bingley,


599
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,342
I've never been so happy
to leave a place in my life!
