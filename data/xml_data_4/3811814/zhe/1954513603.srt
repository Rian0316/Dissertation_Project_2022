13
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:36,158
根据牛津大学最近的一项研究表明

就会失去一到两个亲密朋友

为什么我谈恋爱
Why would I lose friends

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,140
就会失去朋友呢?

00:00:51,142 --> 00:00:53,175
对呀 你和Amy谈上的时候 就没失去朋友
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy.

22
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:56,378
是没有 但研究说的是浪漫对象
Yeah, well, no, the study refers to romantic partners.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,615
我和Amy可不属于这个范畴
Not the way I would categorize the two of us.

24
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:01,217
可你们也会亲嘴牵手
You guys kiss and hold hands.

25
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:03,652
我看到他怎么做的 一点都不浪漫
I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.

26
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,854
听着 我不是那种
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

27
00:01:05,856 --> 00:01:08,657

So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?

44
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,836
我不想谈这个话题
I don't want to talk about it.

45
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:54,239
- 但他还是会抱怨  - 我妈帮他装了有线!

你好
Hello.

59
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,375
Raj 她的事你没骗我们呀
Well, Raj, you were not lying about her.

60
00:02:21,377 --> 00:02:24,178
我就说她是真人
I told you she exists.

61
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,213
嘿 我听说你是皮肤科医生

对 我在Huntington医院工作

64
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:34,622
没错 哪怕我没有得天狗热
Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever,

65
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:37,024
他们还是会给棒棒糖吃
they still let you take a lollipop.

66
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:39,760
要知道 Panny刚开始接受
You know, Penny just started training

67
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,495
医药销售代表的培训
to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

68
00:02:41,497 --> 00:02:43,664
也许她能和你练习一下
Maybe she can practice on you some time.

69
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:46,367
我想在真正的医生身上试手会比较好
Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.

70
00:02:46,369 --> 00:02:48,536
我想应该没问题的
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

71
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:52,239
我屁股上长了些奇怪的斑点
I have some odd freckles on my buttocks.

72
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:57,712
我能预约个时间 让你帮忙看看吗?
Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?

73
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:00,181
呃... 我想可以吧
Um... okay, I guess.

74
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:03,017
我和他在一起三年 什么都没看着
I'm with him three years, nothing.

75
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,420
她才来了两分钟 他就想脱裤子了
She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.

76
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:13,494
昨晚真有趣 你觉得Emily怎么样?
Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?

77
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:14,829
我不知道
I don't know.

78
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:16,998
我有种感觉 她不喜欢我
I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,766
她说不喜欢你了吗?
Did she say she didn't like you?

80
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:19,900
当然没说 没人会当着
Of course not. No one ever says

81
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,435
对方的面说不喜欢她
they don't like you straight to your face.

82
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:25,306
我们的经历太不一样了
We have led different lives.

83
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:29,543
你们刚认识 她怎么会那么想?
You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?

84
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,012
这只是我的感觉罢了
It's just this vibe I got.

85
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:32,994
肯定是你想太多了
I'm sure you're worried about nothing.

86
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,415
对 也许你说得对
Yeah. You're probably right.

87
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:35,783
我以前觉得高中体育老师
I used to think my high school P.E. teacher

88
00:03:35,785 --> 00:03:37,018
不喜欢我 结果却是
didn't like me, but it turned out,

89
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,186
她太过喜欢我了
she liked me a little too much.

90
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:40,454
- 真的?  - 对呀
- Really?  - Yeah.

91
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:41,689
不过没事
It was fine.

92
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:43,557
我们一起听了Melissa Etheridge的音乐会 我拿了A
We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A,

93
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,226
结果都是好的
it all worked out.

94
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,562
等你去Emily办公室练习的时候就会发现 没事的
When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.

95
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,264
我希望你是对的
Yeah, I hope you're right.

96
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,233
你真的这辈子
You really went your entire life

97
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:55,870
都没遇到别人当面说"我讨厌你"?
without anyone saying "I hate you" to your face?

98
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,438
对呀
Yeah.

99
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,442
我现在很想说 但你的颧骨太可爱了
I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

100
00:04:08,184 --> 00:04:10,184
我好想念Stuart的店
I miss Stuart's place.

101
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:13,854
吵杂的音乐和暴露在外的墙砖
All this loud music and exposed brick.

102
00:04:13,856 --> 00:04:16,123
这到底是个漫画店
What, is this a comic book store,

103
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,627
还是三只小猪的围栏?
or a rave at the third little pig's house?

104
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,897
我真希望Stuart能重新开张
Yup, I wish Stuart would reopen.

105
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,899
我也讨厌这个地方
I hate this place, too.

106
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:26,701
好吧 我相信他说的话
Okay, him I believe

107
00:04:26,703 --> 00:04:29,870
因为他是个穿着青少年T恤的怀旧老头子
because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

108
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,639
但你只是在生
But you're just upset

109
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:35,042
Stuart 你妈妈和那些HBO有线电视台的气
about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.

110
00:04:35,044 --> 00:04:38,546
是的 我现在甚至在看"权利的游戏"时
Yes, I am. You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now

111
00:04:38,548 --> 00:04:40,214
脑海里都有我妈的吼声
without thinking of mother saying,

112
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:43,384
"Stuart 谁是权利啊?"
"Stuart, which one is Thrones?"

113
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
他可能不会重新开张了
You know, he might not reopen.

114
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:49,056
他没从保险公司那拿到多少钱
He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.

115
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:51,716
我的天 只有一样东西能让我火大的话
Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat,

116
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:55,019
那就是那帮保险公司的小兔崽子
those dad-gum insurance companies.

117
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,622
为什么? 他们拽着您老的胡子不放?
Why? Because they won't get off your lawn?

118
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:05,563
哦 那Stuart有没有试着去贷款 或者...或者找投资商?
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a loan, or-or find investors?

119
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:07,598
我只知道 他让我妈给他
All I know is, he's got my mother

120
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,668
买了超厚卫生纸 真的 四层加厚的
buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply.

121
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,104
他的屁股如此娇嫩
If his butt is so delicate,

122
00:05:13,106 --> 00:05:15,473
为什么不买只长毛兔擦屁股?
why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?

123
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:19,543
首先 它们会掉毛还会咬人
For starters, they shed and bite.

124
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,179
嘿
Hey,

125
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:23,648
我有个办法
here's a thought.

126
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,150
我们几个人凑钱补上Stuart还需要的资金
Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?

127
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,788
那这样 我们就是 漫画书店的股东了?
So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?

128
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:34,191
有种梦想成真的感觉
It's kind of a dream come true.

129
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:35,693
听起来真不错
That does sound fun.

130
00:05:35,695 --> 00:05:37,228
噢 说不定我们还可以
Ooh, maybe we could come up

131
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,730
制定商业计划来和这家店竞争
with a business plan to compete with this place.

132
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,599
我现在就给你制定计划
I'll give you a plan right now.

133
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:44,101
第一步: 开一家漫画书店
Step one: open comic book store.

134
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,569
第二步: 开始散播谣言
Step two: start rumor

135
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,873
这家书店会让你得生殖器疣
this comic book store gives you genital warts.

136
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,679
第三步: 买个大袋子装钱
Step three: buy a big bag to put the money in.

137
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,050
这主意还不赖
It's not that bad.

138
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:06,424
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hi.

139

00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:13,806
我不知道你喜欢什么 所以我买了
I wasn't sure what you like, so I got

144
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,042
普通的 卡布奇诺的 还有香料茶
a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea.

145
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:19,178
你喜欢Raj 我想你可能会喜欢香料茶
Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.

146
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,481
谢谢 我们可以开始了吧 我有点忙
Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.

147
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,251
好的 当然 我先把材料拿出来
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials.

148
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,752
这公文包是Leonard送给我的
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

149
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,421
他以前在高中背的
He used to carry it around in high school.

150
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:31,757
你还能看到包上的凹痕 人家拿这包砸他留下的
You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it.

151
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:36,028
好吧 我给你介绍
Okay, I would like to talk to you

152
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,297
我们的新避孕药 氟美弗拉
about our new birth control pill, Femevra.

153
00:06:38,299 --> 00:06:39,632
不错
Great.

154
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,667
那么 氟美弗拉的三相设计
So, Femevra's triphasic design

155
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:43,803
能平衡你的荷尔蒙分泌
provides balanced hormonal exposure.

156
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:45,638
好的
All right.

157
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,407
同样也被证明
It has also been shown to cause

158
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:51,444
它比其他口服避孕药导致的副作用更少
significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.

159
00:06:51,446 --> 00:06:54,313
虽然会让你长痘痘 同样 这也是一种
Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of

160
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:57,083
有效的避孕方式
increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.

161
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:02,655
真有趣
Funny.

162
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:06,959
好吧 抱歉 我们之间是不是有误解?
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot?

163
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:08,828
因为从那天晚上开始 我就有点觉得
Because since the other night, I kind of feel like

164
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,363
你可能对我存在芥蒂
you might have a problem with me.

165
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:11,731
不 挺好的
No, it's fine.

166
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:14,300
你确定吗 看起来不是很好啊
Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?

167
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:16,535
好吧
Okay.

168
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,337
你非要说这个问题的话
If you really want to talk about this,

169
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:19,639
我确实心存芥蒂
I do have a problem.

170
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:21,907
天哪 告诉我... 我哪做错了?
Oh, my God. Tell me... what did I do?

171
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,275
其实没什么 我只是...
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

172
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,911
Raj告诉我不久前 你俩睡过
Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.

173
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:30,182
什么?! 他为什么那么说?
What?! Oh, why would he say that?

174
00:07:30,184 --> 00:07:31,684
你们没有吗?
Did it not happen?

175
00:07:31,686 --> 00:07:34,453
好吧 准确来说不算睡过
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.

176
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,554
你们接吻了?
Did you kiss?

177
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,523
是的
Yeah.

178
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,525
你们都裸着?
Were you naked?

179
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,926
是的
Yeah.

180
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,728
那就是睡过了
So, it was a hook-up.

181
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,697
没有
No.

182
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,899
有
Yeah.

183
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:52,672
那么 我们有什么办法可以增加
So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store

184
00:07:52,674 --> 00:07:54,340
我们漫画店的竞争力?
apart from the competition?

185
00:07:54,342 --> 00:07:56,075
孩子买漫画书 那就这样
Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great

186
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:58,177
找个办法让我们店里的孩子比别的店里多
to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.

187
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:00,179
我小的时候 我就很喜欢去漫画店
You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there,

188
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:02,181
但是从来搭不到车
but I could never get a ride.

189
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:06,185
哦 那我们就开辆货车四处转悠带孩子们去漫画店吧?
Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?

190
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:12,391
好主意
Nice.

191
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:16,829
你的意思是 就像去公园和学校那样?
You mean, like at parks and schools?

192
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,366
玩具店 宠物展
Toy stores, puppet shows.

193
00:08:20,368 --> 00:08:24,503
等等 你们的主意是要弄一辆货车
Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van

194
00:08:24,505 --> 00:08:27,940
在大街上找搭车的孩子?
and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?

195
00:08:29,477 --> 00:08:31,844
是的
Yes.

196
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,716
然后要用糖引诱他们上车?
And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?

197
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,119
你不说我们还想不到呢!
We are now!

198
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:44,390
你告诉Emily我们睡过?!
You told Emily we hooked up?!

199
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:47,760
要我说 我告诉了所有人
Um, well, in my defense, I tell everybody.

200
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,161
你为什么这么说?!
Why would you say that?!

201
00:08:49,163 --> 00:08:51,464
那时候我们在说前任的问题
We were having a conversation about past lovers.

202
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:52,598
我们没有谈过恋爱! 拜托
We weren't lovers! Come on.

203
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,866
每个人都知道我们没有上床
Everyone knows we didn't sleep together.

204
00:08:53,868 --> 00:08:55,167
我们只是喝醉了犯傻
We got drunk and fooled around.

205
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,936
为什么你要扯上我呢?
Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?

206
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,070
我们都坦诚相告
Well, we were being honest.

207
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,839
那你甩了Leonard之后
You would leave me out of the conversation

208
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:01,707
和下一任也不会提起我吗
with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

209
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,877
- 说这个干嘛?  - 是的!
- Why say it?  - Yes!

210
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,246
我不会把你在我的恋爱史上排除掉的
Well, I would never leave you off my list,

211
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:08,881
而且 
and not just

212
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:10,182
因为 没有你的话
because, without you,

213
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:12,618
我的恋爱好像就没有"史"了
we're playing fast and loose with the word "list".

214
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,653
干得漂亮 现在她讨厌我了
Well, good job. Now she hates me.

215
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,822
哦
Oh.

216
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,091
这下好了
Great.

217
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:21,594
至少 牛津大学的研究是对的
On the bright side, that Oxford study was right.

218
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,662
你已经少了一个朋友了
One friend down.

219
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:28,934
真想知道下一个会是谁
I wonder who you're going to lose next.

220
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,337
是你 行了吧? 就是你了 我们... 友尽!
You, okay? It's you. You're... you're next!

221
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:36,108
才不会呢 你那么喜欢我
No. You're crazy about me.

223
00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:47,043
真不明白Emily为什么这么在意这件事
I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway.

224
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,979
就算我和他上过床 那又怎样? 每个人都有过去啊
Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past.

225
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:53,449
大多数人都有过去
Almost everyone has a past.

226
00:09:53,451 --> 00:09:54,884
别这样 你这么漂亮
Come on, look how pretty you are.

227
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,986
她肯定不是第一个讨厌你的女孩
I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.

228
00:09:56,988 --> 00:09:59,589
确实不是
It's not.

229
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,225
你肯定能改变这种状况的
And I'm sure you can turn it around.

230
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,527
怎么改变啊? 你总不能逼着别人喜欢你吧
How? You can't force someone to like you.

231
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,595
不如这样
What if you just

232
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:07,263
你就假装是她朋友一样和她玩
hang around and act like her friend

233
00:10:07,265 --> 00:10:09,832
直到你的耐心打动她 不知不觉的 你就可以
until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know,

234
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,189
去她家里 吃她的东西
you're in her home, you're eating her food,

235
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,284
喝她的酒了
drinking her wine.

236
00:10:15,207 --> 00:10:16,806
不行 不靠谱
No, that won't work.

237
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:19,142
说得对 干杯
You're right. Cheers.

238
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,410
我知道了
Oh, I know.

239
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,378
何不试试用你学过的销售知识
Why don't you use your sales training

240
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,614
回去推销你自己呢?
to go back down there and sell yourself?

241
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,015
- 什么?  - 没错
- What?  - Yeah.

242
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:27,584
只不过这次卖的不是药
But instead of selling a drug,

243
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,385
而是Penny... 多可爱啊
you'd be selling Penny... it's cute.

244
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:30,420
多蠢啊
It's stupid.

245
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,622
好吧 你要是不这样 直接否定别人的意见的话
Well, maybe people would like you more

246
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,391
就没那么招恨了
if you didn't crap all over their ideas.

247
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,994
我觉得Penny说得对
I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.

248
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,631
为什么不呢? 我们这么多年的好朋友了
Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.

249
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:44,667
天啊 我以前根本都不喜欢你
Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.

250
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:47,870
嘘 Amy就在你旁边呢
Shh. Amy's here now.

251
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,209
知道吗 我越来越想要
You know, the more I think about it,

252
00:10:53,211 --> 00:10:56,846
真的和你们一起开一家漫画书店了
the more intrigued I am about having our own store.

253
00:10:56,848 --> 00:10:58,848
那样我们就可以
We'll get to see all the new stuff

254
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,483
在新书上架之前就看到内容了
before it hits the shelves.

255
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,385
我们还可以开心的
And we'll get to have fun interactions

256
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,553
和顾客聊天
with our customers.

257
00:11:03,555 --> 00:11:07,190
"这里不是图书馆... 买不买不买滚"
 "This isn't a library... buy it or get out."

258
00:11:07,192 --> 00:11:10,159
你其实一直都说这种话的
You say things like that all the time.

259
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:12,428
是啊 不过我要是店主的话 就有话可以回复
Yes, but as a store owner, I'll finally have a good comeback

260
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,897
"这又不是你的地盘... 闭嘴吧"
to, "You don't work here... shut up."

261
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,568
呃 你知道Penny跟Raj说他不应该把她当做
Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have

262
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,403
- 前任吗?  - 听说了
- left her off his list?  - Yeah.

263
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,905
那你觉得我们讨论这个问题的时候
Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation,

264
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:24,407
她也藏了些别的前任了吗?
she left people off her list?

265
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,742
肯定的啊
I'm sure she did.

266
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:27,777
为什么?
Why?

267
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,512
因为如果她没有藏的话
Because if she hadn't,

268
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:33,216
她说到现在都说不完
she'd still be wading through the list.

269
00:11:33,218 --> 00:11:34,917
你能别说话吗?
Will you stay out of this?

270
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:37,587
希望Penny也就说过那么几次吧
If only Penny had said that once in a while.

271
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,190
嘿 有什么区别吗?
Hey, what difference does it make?

272
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,026
她想嫁的人是你啊
You're the one she wants to marry.

273
00:11:43,028 --> 00:11:44,761
- 这倒是真的  - 而且我也不确定
- That's true.  - Yeah, and I'm not sure

274
00:11:44,763 --> 00:11:47,730
在二人世界里 完全的坦诚
that complete honesty is always the best thing

275
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:49,565
是不是最好的选择
for a relationship.

276
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:52,602
他说得对 有一次 我特别坦诚地告诉Amy
Yeah, he's right. Once, in a moment of candor,

277
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,438
她的头发让我想起
I told Amy that her hair reminded me

278
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,608
浸在油里的鸭子 然后...
of a duck caught in an oil spill. Well...

279
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,476
她摔门而出
she stormed out.

280
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,146
太悲伤了 因为那时候我们正在玩拼词游戏
Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble,

281
00:12:03,148 --> 00:12:07,550
而我刚刚拿到能拼出"柿子"的字母
and I had all the letters to spell "persimmon."

282
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,056
你插什么嘴?
Why are you even part of this conversation?

283
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:14,924
你一点都不懂女人
You don't know anything about women.

284
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,627
至少我知道 如果我有老婆或者未婚妻的话
I know that if I had a wife or a fiancée,

285
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:19,696
像投资漫画书店这样的事
I'd ask her first before I invested money

286
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,531
我一定会问问她的意见的
in a comic book store.

287
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,266
他说得对
He's right.

288
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:24,334
是啊
Yeah, well,

289
00:12:24,336 --> 00:12:25,601
当然对了
of course I am.

290
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,036
她头发那件事我说的也没错
I was also right about her hair.

291
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,105
除了不会嘎嘎叫
It did everything but quack.

292
00:12:32,277 --> 00:12:34,510
有件事我想听听你的意见
There's something I wanted to run past you.

293
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:36,679
- 怎么了?  - 呃 我们几个
- What's up?  - Mm, the guys and I

294
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:39,449
想投资给Stuart的漫画书店
were thinking about investing in Stuart's comic book store.

295
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,984
- 你怎么看?  - 你为什么问我?
- Is that okay?  - Why are you asking me?

296
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:43,820
我们毕竟订婚了
Well, you know, we're engaged,

297
00:12:43,822 --> 00:12:46,322
而这件事也算是财务方面的大事
and it's kind of a big deal financially.

298
00:12:46,324 --> 00:12:48,624
我觉得还是问问你的意见比较好
It seems like something we should talk about.

299
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:49,892
这样啊
Oh.

300
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,328
那你觉得成堆的信用卡账单
Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt

301
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,864
是理财方面的大事吗?
kind of a big deal financially?

302
00:12:56,835 --> 00:12:58,868
是啊
Yeah.

303
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,470
哈
Huh.

304
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,742
那个 我们几个最近在讨论一个
Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about

305
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,710
超赞的投资机会...
this great investment opportunity...

306
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:09,712
不行
Nope.

307
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:12,448
你还没听我说完呢
But you didn't hear what it was.

308
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,218
是啊
I know.

309
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,987
别这样嘛
Oh, come on.

310
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:19,455
好吧 什么计划?
Fine. What is it?

311
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:21,557
帮Stuart把漫画书店重新开起来
It's to help reopen the comic book store.

312
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,326
不行
Nope.

313
00:13:23,328 --> 00:13:25,428
听我说完啊
Well, hear me out.

314
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,630
Howard 我们在存钱买房呢
Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.

315
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,966
我知道 但是他们几个都想这么干
I know, but all the guys are doing it.

316
00:13:29,968 --> 00:13:32,869
我们四个一起投资 所以也花不了多少钱
We're splitting it four ways, so it's really not that much money.

317
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:35,638
可是这投资看起来风险有点大
It just seems like a risky investment.

318
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,341
我知道 可是...
I get that. I...

319
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:41,844
好吧 是这样...
Okay, look...

320
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:48,217
我那么想投资漫画店是因为...
The reason this is important is...

321
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,955
我父亲离开我和母亲之前...
before my dad left me and my mom...

322
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,659
他经常... 带我去漫画店
he used to... take me to the comic book store.

323
00:13:57,595 --> 00:14:01,097
去漫画店是曾经我和老爸为数不多的回忆之一
It was one of the few things we did together.

324
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,866
Howie 我以前不知道
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

325
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:07,270
嗯 我不太想... 不太想说的
Well, I don't... like to talk about it.

326
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:09,972
哦 宝贝
Oh, baby.

327
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:13,443
这故事是瞎编的 对吧?
That story's made up, isn't it?

328
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:18,214
这恰恰说明我是有多想投资漫画店了
That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.

329
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,886
我想就某事问问你的意见
I'd like your honest opinion on something.

330
00:14:23,888 --> 00:14:25,121
当然可以
Of course.

331
00:14:25,123 --> 00:14:26,589
在我说之前
Now, before I start,

332
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:30,593
我得说我对这件事情非常感兴趣
I need you to know that I'm very excited about this,

333
00:14:30,595 --> 00:14:32,695
你说的任何观点
and anything you say

334
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,764
如果不是热情支持的话
that isn't enthusiastically supportive

335
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:38,468
可能会极大地影响咱俩的关系
will throw our entire relationship into question.

336
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:42,305
那么...
So...

337
00:14:42,307 --> 00:14:45,074
别拘束啊
keep an open mind.

338
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,177
我觉得有点小怕怕 Sheldon
I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.

339
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,213
很好 那么...
Perfect. Now...

340
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,950
我打算投资
I'm considering investing

341
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:56,652
Stuart的漫画店
in Stuart's comic book store.

342
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,988
很有趣
Interesting.

343
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,826
那么你觉得一位成年人
Can you see how a grown man,

344
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,428
并且是很有成就的科学家
an accomplished scientist,

345
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,964
投资到一家商店里
who invests in a store

346
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:09,832
店里卖的是画册
that sells picture books

347
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,236
画的是穿着五颜六色内裤的飞人...
about flying men in colorful underwear...

348
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:16,672
这样会不会可能浪费
might be wasting both his financial

349
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:18,741
他的财力和智力呢?
and intellectual resources?

350
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,583
不会
No.

351
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,754
那么我觉得这点子很棒
Then I think it's a terrific idea.

352
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,623
太好了
Great.

353
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:37,760
我先给你介绍我们的拉客车
Wait till you hear about our van.

354
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,000
谢谢请我们过来
Thanks for inviting us over.

355
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:45,434
感谢你们愿意来
Oh, thank you for coming.

356
00:15:45,436 --> 00:15:47,970
听着 Penny 你先别说
Uh, listen, Penny, before you start,

357
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,939
我想为先前在办公室里
I just want to apologize for being so rude

358
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:51,274
我对你的粗鲁道歉
the other day in my office.

359
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:52,742
不不 不用道歉
No, no. No need to apologize.

360
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,443
打扰 我能说些话吗?
Excuse me, can I say something?

361
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:56,579
我真是太爱你俩了
I just love both you guys,

362
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,548
我想让你们好好相处
and I want you to get along.

363
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,150
我说"爱"你 是指朋友的"爱"
And when I say "love" I meant as a friend.

364
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,887
呃 现在表白还过早?
And, uh, way too soon, right?

365
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,890
好 坐下吧 听着 Emily
Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily,

366
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:09,458
我和Raj之前发生的事
what happened between me and Raj

367
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,260
是很久以前了
was a long time ago.

368
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,328
确实 而且我曾经
It was, and I may have made it seem

369
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:14,030
把这事太过当真了
like a bigger deal than I should have.

370
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:15,498
没错 现在我和Leonard在谈恋爱
Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now,

371
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,900
我只是希望我们能够一起忘掉这事
and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.

372
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:19,368
我也想这样
Mm. I'd like that, too.

373
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,537
嗯 我想我也没问题
Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it,

374
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,773
但是当时我看到你那么漂亮
but then I saw how pretty you are.

375
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:25,308
哦 你嘴真甜
Oh, that's so sweet.

376
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:27,443
我是说 瞧瞧你 你也很美
I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous.

377
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:31,180
没错... 你俩都很美
It's true... you're both gorgeous.

378
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,383
是不是侧面说明
Kind of says something about the 

379
00:16:32,383 --> 00:16:33,883
能把你们俩都上了的男人...
man who could bed you both.

380
00:16:40,325 --> 00:16:44,660
你现在明白为啥我总是单身了吧
You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.

381
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:50,066
- 是什么风把你俩吹来了?  - 嗯
- So, what brings you by?  - Well,

382
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:52,835
我俩来不需要理由... 这是我家
I don't need a reason... it's my house.

383
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,171
严格意义上说 这是你妈家 但...
Technically, it's your mom's house, but...

384
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,174
对你的到来 我们很欢迎
we certainly want you to feel welcome.

385
00:16:58,176 --> 00:17:00,943
我一直很受欢迎
I'm always welcome.

386
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:03,713
嗯... 下次来之前打个招呼
Mm, just... try and call first.

387
00:17:03,715 --> 00:17:06,983
好吧 先说正经事
Okay, let's get down to business.

388
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,352
Howie考虑给你的漫画店投资
Howie was thinking about putting up some money

389
00:17:09,354 --> 00:17:12,321
帮助你重开店面 但在那之前
to help you reopen the store, but before that happens,

390
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,390
我有几个问题
I have a few questions.

391
00:17:14,392 --> 00:17:15,758
我很感谢你们的帮助
I appreciate the offer,

392
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,894
但是你妈已经把钱给我了
but actually your mother already gave me the money.

393
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,865
什么?
What?

394
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,001
你没听错 我还说给的太多了
Yeah. I told her it was too much,

395
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:28,170
但是她说他很乐意帮助她的小亲亲
but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.

396
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,707
失陪一下
Excuse me.

397
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:35,011
妈 你得把那支票撕了
Ma, you are canceling that check,

398
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:37,780
Stuart不是你的小亲亲 我才是
and Stuart is not your bubala; I'm your bubala.

399
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:41,050
你不能同时有两个小亲亲!
You can't have more than one bubala!

400
00:17:41,052 --> 00:17:42,785
我不知道他在和谁说话
I don't know who he's talking to.

401
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,254
他妈已经跑到超市 帮我买衣服去了
She's at Target, buying me shirts.

402
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,793
我真是很高兴你俩能和好
I'm so glad we could work this all out.

403
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:53,429
我也是 你知道吗 我们应该一起
Yeah, me, too. You know, we should have dinner

404
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:54,797
共进晚餐 带上Leonard
one night with you and Leonard.

405
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:55,998
哦 那样太好了
Oh, we would love that.

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,732
不错!
Great!

407
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:00,036
- 好吧 晚安  - 好 晚安
- Okay, good night, guys.  - All right, night.

408
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,038
再见
Bye.

409
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,607
- 我讨厌她  - 我讨厌她
- I hate her.  - I hate her.

410
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,105
我对不能拥有自己的漫画店
I'm really disappointed we're not gonna have

411
00:18:15,107 --> 00:18:16,000
感到无比失望
our own comic book store.

412
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,807
我懂
I know.

413
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:18,075
我原本很期待的
I was looking forward to it. 

414
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,877
如果有我们自己的漫画店有多好
It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours,

415
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:23,847
我们就可以坐下来安静地看书
where we could just sit and read comics in peace.

416
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,315
舒服的座位
With comfy seats.

417
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:26,683
还有零食
And snacks.

418
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,785
也许这愿望只能想想了
Well, I guess it was too good to be true.

419
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,320
是啊
Yeah.
