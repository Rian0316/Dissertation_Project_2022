1
00:00:02,522 --> 00:00:04,602
你们有听说过有个研究小组
Have you guys heard about this research team

2
00:00:04,602 --> 00:00:07,532
想要从基因方面操控鸡的DNA
that's trying to genetically manipulate Chicken DNA

3
00:00:07,532 --> 00:00:09,862
来创造某种类似鸡恐龙的事情吗
to create some sort of a chicken dinosaur?

4
00:00:10,482 --> 00:00:13,182
我觉得这听起来超赞啊
I think that sounds wonderful.

5
00:00:14,122 --> 00:00:17,482
什么  你不是又怕恐龙又怕鸡吗
What? You're afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.

6
00:00:17,942 --> 00:00:19,342
是啊  但你敢说
Yes, but tell me

7
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:20,982
鸡恐龙肉沙拉三明治
a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich

8
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:24,012
不会正中美味白垩纪之点吗
wouldn't hit the Mesozoic spot.

9
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,092
-你们好啊  -你好
- Hey, guys. - Hey. Hello.

10
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:29,382
明晚都会出席的吧
We still on for tomorrow night?

11
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:31,222
当然  我很期待终于能见到你的女朋友呢
Yeah. I'm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.

12
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,082
是啊  说到这事
Yeah, oh, and speaking of which.

13
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:36,312
根据牛津大学最新的研究指出
According to a recent study out of Oxford University,

14
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:38,922
一个人有了新的浪漫伴侣之后
when someone takes on a new romantic partner,

15
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:42,612
会失去一到两个好朋友
that person loses one or two close friends.

16
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:45,122
你什么时候开始看社会科学了
Since when do you read social science?

17
00:00:45,122 --> 00:00:48,242
我也会上厕所  也需要厕所读物啊
I go to the bathroom like everybody else.

18
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:51,002
为什么我会因为有了对象而失去朋友呢
Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?

19
00:00:51,002 --> 00:00:52,812
是啊  你跟艾米好上后  也没少了朋友啊
Yeah, you didn't lose anyone when you met Amy.

20
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:56,212
人家研究是说浪漫伴侣
Yeah, well, no, the study refers to romantic partners.

21
00:00:56,722 --> 00:00:59,492
我可不会把我们的关系归到这一类
Not the way I would categorize the two of us.

22
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:00,872
你们也接吻和牵手啊
You guys kiss and hold hands.

23
00:01:00,872 --> 00:01:03,662
我看过他们做这些事  完全不浪漫
I've seen him do it. It's not romantic.

24
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:05,842
我可不是那种
Look, I'm not the kind of guy

25
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:08,442
一谈恋爱就会重色轻友的人
who drops his friends just because he's in a relationship.

26
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:10,562
要是她不喜欢我们呢
What happens if she doesn't like us?

27
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:12,612
别这样  你们可是我的好朋友
Well, hey, you're my dear friends.

28
00:01:12,612 --> 00:01:14,082
开始几年  我还是会给你们寄圣诞卡
You'll get a Christmas card for a couple of years,

29
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,702
之后你们哪凉快死哪去
and then you're dead to me.

30
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:46,312
霍华德  斯图尔特还跟你妈住在一起吗
So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?

31
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:47,982
我不想谈这事
I don't want to talk about it.

32
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,942
-但他还是会谈  -我妈帮他装了收费台
- But he's going to. - My mom got him cable!

33
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:52,412
我从小到大
In my whole life,

34
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,252
住在那个房子里  就没看过收费台
growing up in that house-- no cable.

35
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,452
你知道我妈付钱
Do you know how many HBOs

36
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,972
给那寄生虫装了多少电影频道吗  七个
that leech had my mother get him? Seven.

37
00:01:57,972 --> 00:02:00,932
七个电影频道呢  七个啊
Seven HBOs. Seven!

38
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:04,332
长话短说  就是他们有七个电影频道
Long story short, they have seven HBOs.

39
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:06,502
各位
Hey, guys.

40
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:07,182
你好
Hello.

41
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:09,032
-艾米丽  在座各位你差不多都认识  -你好
- Emily, you know almost everybody here. - Hi.

42
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:10,962
这位是莱纳德  这是佩妮
This is Leonard, this is Penny.

43
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:12,052
幸会幸会
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

44
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:14,142
-我也是  -你好
- Nice to finally meet you, too. - Hi.

45
00:02:14,352 --> 00:02:15,342
好
Hello.

46
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:17,402
拉杰  你真的没骗我们
Well, Raj, you were not lying about her.

47
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:19,612
我就说她真实存在
I told you she exists.

48
00:02:20,762 --> 00:02:22,492
我听说你是皮肤科医生
Hey, I hear you're a dermatologist.

49
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,142
是的  我是亨廷顿医院的住院医师
Uh, yeah, I'm a resident at Huntington Hospital.

50
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:28,272
我好喜欢他们的急诊室
Oh, I like their emergency room.

51
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:31,032
就算检查结果显示你没得登革热
Yeah, even if it turns out you don't have Dengue fever,

52
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:33,322
你还是可以拿根棒棒糖
they still let you take a lollipop.

53
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,072
佩妮刚刚开始
You know, Penny just started training

54
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,862
医药销售的培训
to be a pharmaceutical sales rep.

55
00:02:37,862 --> 00:02:39,692
或许有机会她可以跟你练习练习
Maybe she can practice on you some time.

56
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,342
如果能跟一名真医生练习就太好了
Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor.

57
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,302
可以啊  没问题
Yeah. I'm sure that'd be fine.

58
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:48,332
我的屁屁上有些奇怪的斑点
I have some odd freckles on my buttocks.

59
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:53,152
我能跟你约个时间就诊吗
Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?

60
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:56,842
应该...  可以吧
Um... okay, I guess.

61
00:02:57,922 --> 00:02:59,482
我都跟了他三年  毛都没捞着
I'm with him three years, nothing.

62
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:02,432
她刚进来两分钟  他就要对人脱裤子了
She's with two minutes, and he's taking his pants off.

63
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:10,172
昨晚挺有意思  你觉得艾米丽如何
Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?

64
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,342
不知道
I don't know.

65
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:13,382
我感觉她好像不太喜欢我
I kind of got the sense she didn't like me.

66
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:14,942
她有说她不喜欢你吗
Did she say she didn't like you?

67
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:15,992
当然没有  才不会有人
Of course not. No one ever says

68
00:03:15,992 --> 00:03:17,932
当着你的面说不喜欢你呢
they don't like you straight to your face.

69
00:03:18,462 --> 00:03:21,582
咱俩的人生路真是大不同啊
We have led different lives.

70
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:26,022
你们才刚认识  你怎么会有这种感觉呢
You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?

71
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,362
我就是感觉到了
It's just this vibe I got.

72
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:29,292
应该是你想太多了
I'm sure you're worried about nothing.

73
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,252
我想你说得对
Yeah. You're probably right.

74
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,442
我曾经以为我高中的体育老师不喜欢我
I used to think my high school P.E. Teacher didn't like me,

75
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,922
后来发现  她是"太"喜欢我
but it turned out, she liked me a little too much.

76
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:36,682
-真的吗  -是啊
- Really? - Yeah.

77
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,332
也还好啦
It was fine.

78
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:38,702
我们一起去了梅莉莎・埃瑟里奇的演唱会  
We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert,

79
00:03:37,332 --> 00:03:41,272
{\an8}梅莉莎・埃瑟里奇  美国女歌手  
也是积极参与同志权利运动的社会活动家

80
00:03:38,702 --> 00:03:41,272
我后来成绩得了A  一切圆满
I got an A, it all worked out.

81
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,792
等你去她办公室练习  你就知道你多虑了
When you go to Emily's office to practice, you'll see. It's fine.

82
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,512
希望就像你说的吧
Yeah, I hope you're right.

83
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,502
你真的这辈子从未试过
You really went your entire life

84
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:52,262
有人当面对你说"我讨厌你"吗
without anyone saying "I hate you" to your face?

85
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:54,152
对啊
Yeah.

86
00:03:54,592 --> 00:03:57,632
我现在就想对你说  但瞧你那迷人的颧骨
I'd say it now, but look at those cheekbones.

87
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:06,682
我好想念斯图尔特的店
I miss Stuart's place.

88
00:04:06,682 --> 00:04:10,492
看这店吵杂的音乐  露出的砖墙
All this loud music and exposed brick.

89
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,362
这里是漫画书店
What, is this a comic book store,

90
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,942
还是第三只小猪砖房家中的派对啊
or a rave at the third little pig's house?

91
00:04:17,532 --> 00:04:19,272
是啊  我也希望斯图尔特重新开店
Yup, I wish Stuart would reopen.

92
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:21,242
我也讨厌这家店
I hate this place, too.

93
00:04:21,242 --> 00:04:22,942
我相信他是真心的
Okay, him I believe

94
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,432
因为他就是个80岁老头穿15岁小孩的衣服
because he's an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-old's T-shirt.

95
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:28,472
但你只是在不爽
But you're just upset about

96
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:31,342
斯图尔特和你妈以及他们的付费电影台
Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs.

97
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:32,532
没错
Yes, I am.

98
00:04:32,532 --> 00:04:34,702
我现在看《权力的游戏》时  都会想到
You know, I can't even watch Game of Thrones now

99
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:36,322
我妈在问他
without thinking of mother saying,

100
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:40,232
"斯图尔特  他们谁是'权力'"
"Stuart, which one is Thrones?"

101
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:43,232
他可能不能重新开张
You know, he might not reopen.

102
00:04:43,232 --> 00:04:45,342
保险公司没赔给他多少钱
He didn't get a lot of money from the insurance company.

103
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:48,062
天啊  如果有一件事能让我生气
Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat,

104
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:51,092
就是那些该死的保险公司
it's those dad-gum insurance companies.

105
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:54,202
为什么  因为他们整天来烦你这死老头吗
Why? Because they won't get off your lawn?

106
00:04:58,412 --> 00:05:01,832
斯尔图特有试着去贷款  或找人投资吗
Oh, is Stuart trying to get a loan, or-or find investors?

107
00:05:01,832 --> 00:05:02,992
我只知道他让我妈
All I know is, he's got my mother

108
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,132
给他买四层的厕纸  
buying four-ply toilet paper.

109
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:07,242
四层的啊
I mean, four-ply.

110
00:05:08,032 --> 00:05:09,052
如果他的屁股那么娇气
If his butt is so delicate,

111
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:11,702
干嘛不直接用安哥拉兔子擦呢
why doesn't he just use an angora rabbit?

112
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:16,172
{\an8}安哥拉兔毛颜色洁白  轻细  滑软  美观  暖和
是一种高级纺织原料

113
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:16,172
首先它们会掉毛  还会咬人
For starters, they shed and bite.

114
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:19,752
我有个想法
Hey, here's a thought.

115
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:22,652
我们何不帮斯尔图特把剩下的钱凑够呢
Why don't we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?

116
00:05:24,132 --> 00:05:28,002
那我们就是漫画书店的店主了
So, we'd be, like, owners of a comic book store?

117
00:05:28,692 --> 00:05:30,452
就像是美梦成真
It's kind of a dream come true.

118
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:31,982
听起来蛮有意思
That does sound fun.

119
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:33,072
或许我们还能想出
Ooh, maybe we could come up

120
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,822
一个跟这地方抗衡的商业计划
with a business plan to compete with this place.

121
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,862
我现在就有一个计划
I'll give you a plan right now.

122
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:40,412
第一步  开一家漫画书店
Step one: open comic book store.

123
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:41,722
第二步  散布谣言
Step two: start rumor

124
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:44,922
说这家漫画书店会让人得生殖器疣
this comic book store gives you genital warts.

125
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:51,472
第三步  买一个大袋子装钱
Step three: buy a big bag to put the money in.

126
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:55,772
这计划还不错
It's not that bad.

127
00:06:02,582 --> 00:06:05,332
非常感谢你能当我的客户  让我练习推销说辞
Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you.

128
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,392
我真的感激不尽
I really appreciate it.

129
00:06:06,392 --> 00:06:08,282
-没事  -我给你买了咖啡
- Sure. - Um, I brought coffee.

130
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:09,722
我不太确定你喜欢哪种  所以我买了
I wasn't sure what you like, so I got

131
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:12,342
普通咖啡  卡布奇诺和印度拉茶各一杯
a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea.

132
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:14,852
因为你喜欢拉杰  所以我想你可能喜欢印度口味
Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that.

133
00:06:16,482 --> 00:06:18,802
谢谢  我们开始吧  我有点忙
Thanks. If we could get started. I'm a little busy.

134
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:21,322
当然可以  让我先把材料拿出来
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials.

135
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:22,832
这手提包是莱纳德给我的
Leonard gave me this briefcase.

136
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:24,612
他高中时随身带着它
He used to carry it around in high school.

137
00:06:24,612 --> 00:06:27,342
所以老被人拿来打他  现在还能看见凹痕呢
You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it.

138
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,922
进入正题  我想介绍一下
Okay, I would like to talk to you

139
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:34,522
我们新出的避孕药  弗米拉
about our new birth control pill, Femevra.

140
00:06:34,522 --> 00:06:35,442
好的
Great.

141
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:37,892
弗米拉三相口服避孕药
So, Femevra's triphasic design

142
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:40,382
{\an8}每一周期仿造正常月经周期中荷尔蒙的变化
含有三种不同比例的雌激素与黄体素

143
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:40,382
能平衡荷尔蒙
provides balanced hormonal exposure.

144
00:06:40,762 --> 00:06:42,062
好的
All right.

145
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,372
同时还有实验表明  
It has also been shown to cause

146
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:47,782
它相比其他口服避孕药  副作用少了很多
significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives.

147
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,142
尽管它会导致长青春痘  但是我个人意见
Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of

148
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,422
这也能增加"避孕"的有效性  不是吗
increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive.

149
00:06:57,662 --> 00:06:58,912
呵呵
Funny.

150
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:03,002
抱歉  我一开始就给了你不好的印象吗
Okay, I'm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot?

151
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,592
因为从那晚开始  我就隐约感觉到
Because since the other night, I kind of feel like

152
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,542
你可能对我有意见
you might have a problem with me.

153
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,142
不  没有啊
No, it's fine.

154
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:10,652
你确定吗  因为看起来不像没有
Are you sure, because it doesn't seem fine?

155
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:12,402
好吧
Okay.

156
00:07:12,402 --> 00:07:14,382
如果你真的想谈论此事
If you really want to talk about this,

157
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,622
我的确对你有意见
I do have a problem.

158
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:17,712
天啊  告诉我  我做错了什么
Oh, my God. Tell me-- what did I do?

159
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,752
其实没什么  只是...
Look, it's nothing. It's just...

160
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:22,602
拉杰告诉我  不久之前你们有过一段
Raj told me that a while ago, you two hooked up.

161
00:07:22,602 --> 00:07:25,762
什么  他为什么要这么说
What?! Oh, why would he say that?

162
00:07:26,772 --> 00:07:27,832
那没有吗
Did it not happen?

163
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:30,632
确切来说  那不能称为"有过一段"
Well, I wouldn't exactly call it a hook-up.

164
00:07:30,632 --> 00:07:31,992
你们接吻了吗
Did you kiss?

165
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:33,162
接了
Yeah.

166
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:35,272
你们俩脱光光了吗
Were you naked?

167
00:07:35,272 --> 00:07:36,702
脱了
Yeah.

168
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:38,732
那就是啊
So, it was a hook-up.

169
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:39,562
不是
No.

170
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:42,212
算是吧
Yeah.

171
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,822
有什么办法能让我们的漫画书店
So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store

172
00:07:48,822 --> 00:07:50,452
在同行中脱颖而出
apart from the competition?

173
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:52,482
买漫画的都是小孩  如果能有办法
Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great

174
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:54,352
让更多的小孩来我们店  那就最好了
to figure out a way to get more kids in the store.

175
00:07:54,362 --> 00:07:56,032
在我小的时候  我喜欢去漫画书店
You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there,

176
00:07:56,032 --> 00:07:57,902
但没人载我去
but I could never get a ride.

177
00:07:57,902 --> 00:07:59,492
如果我们搞个面包车
Ooh, what if we got a van

178
00:07:59,492 --> 00:08:02,132
专门在大街上接小孩呢
and drove around and picked kids up?

179
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:08,742
好主意
Nice.

180
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:13,332
你是说去公园和学校守着吗
You mean, like at parks and schools?

181
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:16,012
还有玩具店  木偶剧院
Toy stores, puppet shows.

182
00:08:17,292 --> 00:08:20,932
等等  你们的主意是搞个面包车
Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van

183
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:24,692
在大街上兜来兜去  专门接小孩吗
and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?

184
00:08:25,392 --> 00:08:26,932
是的
Yes.

185
00:08:29,152 --> 00:08:32,932
你们要用糖果引诱他们上车吗
And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?

186
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,502
这个主意好
We are now!

187
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:40,672
你告诉艾米丽我们有过一段吗
You told Emily we hooked up?!

188
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:43,872
我要辩一句  我告诉了所有人
Um, well, in my defense, I tell everybody.

189
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:45,342
你为什么要那样说
Why would you say that?!

190
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,572
我们当时在聊过去的爱人
We were having a conversation about past lovers.

191
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:48,782
我们不是爱人  拜托
We weren't lovers! Come on.

192
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,042
大家都知道我们没有上床
Everyone knows we didn't sleep together.

193
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,342
我们只是喝醉了鬼混而已
We got drunk and fooled around.

194
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,052
你们聊的时候就不能不说到我吗
Why couldn't you just leave me out of it?

195
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,212
我们说了要对彼此坦诚
Well, we were being honest.

196
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:56,022
那如果你甩了莱纳德后  
You would leave me out of the conversation

197
00:08:56,022 --> 00:08:57,852
你和下一个男人聊这话题时  不会说到我吗
with the next guy if you dump Leonard?

198
00:08:57,852 --> 00:09:00,062
-干嘛扯到我  -不会
- Why say it? - Yes!

199
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,832
我决不会把你从我的名单除名
Well, I would never leave you off my list,

200
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:05,562
而且不是因为不提你
and not just because, without you,

201
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:08,562
"名单"可能就不太够数了哦
we're playing fast and loose with the word "list."

202
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,142
干得好  现在她讨厌我了
Well, good job. Now she hates me.

203
00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:14,922
棒极了
Great.

204
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,632
往好的方面看  牛津大学的研究是对的
On the bright side, that Oxford study was right.

205
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:19,712
朋友减一了
One friend down.

206
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,882
我好奇下一个会是谁呢
I wonder who you're going to lose next.

207
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,862
你  就是你  下一个就是你
You, okay? It's you. You're-you're next!

208
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,142
才怪  你这么喜欢我
No. You're crazy about me.

209
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,432
我不懂艾米丽干嘛这么生气
I don't know what Emily's so upset about anyway.

210
00:09:39,432 --> 00:09:40,992
就算我俩睡过了  那又怎样
Even if I had slept with him, so what?

211
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:42,632
每个人都有过去
Everyone has a past.

212
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:46,032
几乎每个人都有过去
Almost everyone has a past.

213
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,312
拜托  你这么漂亮
Come on, look how pretty you are.

214
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:49,862
她肯定不是第一个讨厌你的女生
I'm sure this isn't the first girl to hate you.

215
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,652
的确不是
It's not.

216
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,732
你肯定能改变她的想法
And I'm sure you can turn it around.

217
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,382
怎么改  总不能逼着别人喜欢你吧
How? You can't force someone to like you.

218
00:09:57,382 --> 00:09:59,692
不如你多和她相处  装出闺蜜的样子
What if you just hang around and act like her friend

219
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:01,092
逐渐让她喜欢上你
until you wear her down?

220
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:03,002
接下来  你就登堂入室
I mean, next thing you know, you're in her home,

221
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,382
吃着她家的零食  喝着她家的美酒
you're eating her food, drinking her wine.

222
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:09,322
这招不管用
No, that won't work.

223
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,252
说得对  干杯
You're right. Cheers.

224
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,272
我知道了
Oh, I know.

225
00:10:13,272 --> 00:10:15,132
干嘛不利用你的销售技巧
Why don't you use your sales training

226
00:10:15,132 --> 00:10:17,332
好好向她推销一番你自己呢
to go back down there and sell yourself?

227
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,662
-什么  -真的
- What? - Yeah.

228
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:19,832
不是去推销药物
But instead of selling a drug,

229
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:21,952
而是去推销佩妮  多可爱啊
you'd be selling Penny-- it's cute.

230
00:10:21,952 --> 00:10:23,582
多傻逼啊
It's stupid.

231
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:24,972
要是你不这么鄙视的否定别人的建议
Well, maybe people would like you more

232
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,582
大家也许会更喜欢你
if you didn't crap all over their ideas.

233
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:30,462
这一点我同意佩妮的看法
I'm gonna go with Penny on this one.

234
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,832
这也是理所当然的  我们可是老朋友了
Then again, why wouldn't I? I mean, we go way back.

235
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:37,032
对哦  我以前不喜欢你呢
Oh, my God. I didn't used to like you.

236
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:39,382
别说  艾米在这会听到
Shh. Amy's here now.

237
00:10:44,122 --> 00:10:45,792
我越考虑开店这事
You know, the more I think about it,

238
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:49,572
就越觉得有兴趣
the more intrigued I am about having our own store.

239
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:51,382
新书还没上架
We'll get to see all the new stuff

240
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,062
我们早就看过了
before it hits the shelves.

241
00:10:53,062 --> 00:10:55,962
我们还能和顾客们友好互动
And we'll get to have fun interactions with our customers.

242
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:59,382
"这里不是图书馆  不买就滚"
"This isn't a library-- buy it or get out."

243
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,542
你不是整天对人这么说吗
You say things like that all the time.

244
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,062
是啊  可我要是店主 
Yes, but as a store owner,

245
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:05,732
别人说"店又不是你开的  闭嘴"时
I'll finally have a good comeback to,

246
00:11:05,732 --> 00:11:07,642
我就能理直气壮顶回去了
"You don't work here-- shut up."

247
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:10,822
你记得佩妮对拉杰说
Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have

248
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:13,172
-把她从名单上划掉吗  -记得
- left her off his list? - Yeah.

249
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,232
那你觉得我跟她聊这事时
Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation,

250
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:16,842
她是不是也划掉了某些人呢
she left people off her list?

251
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,422
肯定啊
I'm sure she did.

252
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,812
为什么
Why?

253
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,342
如果她一个都没省略
Because if she hadn't,

254
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:25,022
那名单现在还没念完呢
she'd still be wading through the list.

255
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,632
你能不能别凑进来
Will you stay out of this?

256
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,372
这句话应该是佩妮的台词吧
If only Penny had said that once in a while.

257
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:33,882
那又有什么关系呢
Hey, what difference does it make?

258
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:35,832
你才是她想嫁的那个人
You're the one she wants to marry.

259
00:11:35,832 --> 00:11:36,722
说得对
That's true.

260
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:39,072
而且我觉得恋人之间的绝对坦诚
Yeah, and I'm not sure that complete honesty

261
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:41,912
不一定是件好事
is always the best thing for a relationship.

262
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:43,162
他说得对
Yeah, he's right.

263
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,182
有一次我向艾米坦白
Once, in a moment of candor,

264
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:47,972
说她的头发让我想起了
I told Amy that her hair reminded me

265
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:51,112
沾满泄漏的石油的海鸭  结果...
of a duck caught in an oil spill. Well...

266
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:53,082
她气得夺门而出
she stormed out.

267
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:55,812
实在可悲  因为我们正在玩拼字游戏
Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble,

268
00:11:55,812 --> 00:11:59,882
我马上就要拼出"美洲柿"这词了
and I had all the letters to spell "persimmon."

269
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:05,662
你跟我们瞎凑什么热闹啊
Why are you even part of this conversation?

270
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:07,522
你根本就不懂女人
You don't know anything about women.

271
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:10,192
我知道如果我有老婆或未婚妻
I know that if I had a wife or a fiance,

272
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:12,232
那我投资漫画书店之前
I'd ask her first before I invested money

273
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,322
肯定先问问她的意见
in a comic book store.

274
00:12:15,472 --> 00:12:16,482
他说得对
He's right.

275
00:12:16,482 --> 00:12:18,082
我当然说得对
Yeah, well, of course I am.

276
00:12:18,082 --> 00:12:19,632
我对她头发的评价也是对的
I was also right about her hair.

277
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:21,742
跟鸭子完全一样  除了不嘎嘎叫
It did everything but quack.

278
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,082
有件事我想告诉你一下
There's something I wanted to run past you.

279
00:12:27,082 --> 00:12:28,172
什么事
What's up?

280
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:30,062
我和小伙伴们准备
Mm, the guys and I were thinking about

281
00:12:30,062 --> 00:12:32,052
投资斯图尔特的漫画书店
investing in Stuart's comic book store.

282
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:34,522
-你觉得好吗  -干嘛问我
- Is that okay? - Why are you asking me?

283
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:36,352
我们订婚了
Well, you know, we're engaged,

284
00:12:36,362 --> 00:12:38,862
这可是重大的财务问题
and it's kind of a big deal financially.

285
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:41,162
我想我俩应该讨论一下
It seems like something we should talk about.

286
00:12:42,432 --> 00:12:44,832
那你觉得身负大笔信用卡债务
Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt

287
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,432
算不算重大的财务问题呢
kind of a big deal financially?

288
00:12:49,372 --> 00:12:50,632
算
Yeah.

289
00:12:56,312 --> 00:12:57,992
我和小伙伴们在讨论
So, me and the guys were talking about

290
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,242
这个绝佳的投资机会
this great investment opportunity...

291
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,082
不行
Nope.

292
00:13:03,402 --> 00:13:05,012
你都不知道是什么呢
But you didn't hear what it was.

293
00:13:05,012 --> 00:13:06,272
我能猜到
I know.

294
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:10,682
别这样嘛
Oh, come on.

295
00:13:10,682 --> 00:13:11,882
好吧  是什么
Fine. What is it?

296
00:13:11,882 --> 00:13:14,192
我们想重开漫画书店
It's to help reopen the comic book store.

297
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,812
不行
Nope.

298
00:13:15,812 --> 00:13:17,992
听我说完嘛
Well, hear me out.

299
00:13:18,002 --> 00:13:20,162
霍华德  你知道我们在存钱买房子
Howard, you know we're saving up for a house.

300
00:13:20,172 --> 00:13:22,122
我知道  可大家都会入伙
I know, but all the guys are doing it.

301
00:13:22,122 --> 00:13:23,492
一人只需出四分之一
We're splitting it four ways,

302
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:25,762
所以不会花太多钱
so it's really not that much money.

303
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:28,432
这投资感觉风险挺大
It just seems like a risky investment.

304
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,852
我明白
I get that. I...

305
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,742
听我说
Okay, look...

306
00:13:36,202 --> 00:13:40,752
我非常想开店的原因是
The reason this is important is...

307
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,522
在我爸抛弃我和妈妈之前
...before my dad left me and my mom...

308
00:13:45,522 --> 00:13:50,132
他经常带我去漫画店
he used to... take me to the comic book store.

309
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:53,962
这是我们拥有过为数不多的父子时光
It was one of the few things we did together.

310
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,632
华仔  我不知道这件事
Oh. Howie, I had no idea.

311
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:59,802
我也...不爱对人提这件事
Well, I don't... like to talk about it.

312
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:02,572
亲爱的
Oh, baby.

313
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:05,672
这事是你瞎掰的  对吗
That story's made up, isn't it?

314
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:11,372
为了买下漫画店  我豁出去了
That's how much buying a comic book store means to me.

315
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,582
我希望你能诚实地给我一些意见
I'd like your honest opinion on something.

316
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:17,952
没问题
Of course.

317
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:19,662
在我提问前
Now, before I start,

318
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:23,072
你要知道  我对此事非常激动
I need you to know that I'm very excited about this,

319
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:25,302
所以你所说的每一句话
and anything you say

320
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:27,362
如果不够掏心掏肺百分百支持
that isn't enthusiastically supportive

321
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:31,942
将会令我们的感情产生问题
will throw our entire relationship into question.

322
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:34,972
所以
So...

323
00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:37,612
保持开放的心态
keep an open mind.

324
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:40,962
我感觉无路可走唯有附和了  谢尔顿
I'm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon.

325
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,272
这就对了  现在
Perfect. Now...

326
00:14:43,912 --> 00:14:46,482
我在考虑投资
...I'm considering investing

327
00:14:46,492 --> 00:14:49,322
斯图尔特的漫画店
in Stuart's comic book store.

328
00:14:50,112 --> 00:14:51,942
有意思
Interesting.

329
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:56,322
你不觉得一个成年男子
Can you see how a grown man,

330
00:14:56,322 --> 00:14:58,432
而且是颇有成就的科学家
an accomplished scientist,

331
00:14:58,432 --> 00:15:00,352
投资一家
who invests in a store

332
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:02,492
出售图画书
that sells picture books

333
00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:05,982
主角是穿着色彩斑斓内裤的飞人们
about flying men in colorful underwear...

334
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,312
也许是浪费他的财务
...might be wasting both his financial

335
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:12,032
和智力资源吗
and intellectual resources?

336
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,452
不觉得
No.

337
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,322
那我觉得这个想法太棒了
Then I think it's a terrific idea.

338
00:15:25,102 --> 00:15:26,212
很好
Great.

339
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:29,692
我们面包车的想法更棒哦
Wait till you hear about our van.

340
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,552
谢谢你邀请我们过来
Thanks for inviting us over.

341
00:15:36,552 --> 00:15:37,922
感谢你们能来
Oh, thank you for coming.

342
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:40,332
佩妮  你开始之前
Uh, listen, Penny, before you start,

343
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:42,392
我要先道歉  我那天在办公室
I just want to apologize for being so rude

344
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:43,552
太没礼貌了
the other day in my office.

345
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:45,062
不  不需要道歉
No, no. No need to apologize.

346
00:15:45,062 --> 00:15:46,852
打扰下  我能说些什么吗
Excuse me, can I say something?

347
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:48,472
我爱你们两个
I just love both you guys,

348
00:15:48,472 --> 00:15:51,232
我希望你们合得来
and I want you to get along.

349
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,662
我说的"爱"  对你是朋友之爱
And when I say "love," I meant as a friend.

350
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,952
咱俩之间说"爱"太快了  对吗
And, uh, way too soon, right?

351
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:00,502
坐下吧  听我说  艾米莉
Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily,

352
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,032
我和拉杰的事
what happened between me and Raj

353
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:03,662
-已经是陈年旧事了  -没错
- was a long time ago. - It was,

354
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,172
而且我也不该在这件事上小题大作
and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have.

355
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,752
现在莱纳德和我订婚了
Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now,

356
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:10,632
我希望这事大家就既往不咎吧
and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us.

357
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:12,462
我也希望这样
I'd like that, too.

358
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:14,322
我本来以为我不会心里不舒服
Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it,

359
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:16,332
但结果看到你这么漂亮
but then I saw how pretty you are.

360
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,172
你嘴真甜
Oh, that's so sweet.

361
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,232
瞧你  这么美
I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous.

362
00:16:20,232 --> 00:16:23,012
没错  你俩都美呆了
It's true-- you're both gorgeous.

363
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:27,502
把这两朵娇花带上床的男人该有多优秀啊
Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both.

364
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:37,462
你明白为啥我大半辈子都孤单一人了吧
You get why I've been alone most of my adult life.

365
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,952
什么风把你们吹来了
So, what brings you by?

366
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:45,162
我来这里不需要原因  这是我的房子
Well, I don't need a reason-- it's my house.

367
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:47,552
确切来说  这是你妈妈的房子  但是
Technically, it's your mom's house, but...

368
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:50,752
我们还是希望你能觉得自己是受欢迎的
we certainly want you to feel welcome.

369
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:53,342
我永远都受欢迎
I'm always welcome.

370
00:16:53,342 --> 00:16:56,762
只是  下次来之前先打个电话
Mm, just... try and call first.

371
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,152
好啦  我们说正事吧
Okay, let's get down to business.

372
00:17:00,332 --> 00:17:02,082
华仔考虑投资一点钱
Howie was thinking about putting up some money

373
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,532
帮你重开漫画店
to help you reopen the store,

374
00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:06,462
但在投资前  我有些问题要问
but before that happens, I have a few questions.

375
00:17:07,022 --> 00:17:08,162
我很感谢你的慷慨解囊
I appreciate the offer,

376
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:11,492
但你妈妈已经给我钱了
but actually your mother already gave me the money.

377
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,522
什么
What?

378
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,712
是啊  我跟她说这太慷慨了
Yeah. I told her it was too much,

379
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:21,042
但她说能帮她的小乖乖她很开心
but she said she was happy to help out her bubala.

380
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,452
失陪下
Excuse me.

381
00:17:25,202 --> 00:17:27,682
妈  你赶紧取消支票
Ma, you are canceling that check,

382
00:17:27,682 --> 00:17:30,372
斯图尔特不是你的小乖乖  我才是
and Stuart is not your bubala; I'm your bubala.

383
00:17:30,372 --> 00:17:32,942
你怎能同时拥有两个小乖乖呢
You can't have more than one bubala!

384
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:35,102
我不知道他在冲谁嚷嚷
I don't know who he's talking to.

385
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:37,912
他妈妈去百货店帮我买T恤了
She's at Target, buying me shirts.

386
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:43,452
我真开心问题解决了
I'm so glad we could work this all out.

387
00:17:43,452 --> 00:17:45,252
我也是
Yeah, me, too.

388
00:17:45,252 --> 00:17:47,182
你和莱纳德改天晚上和我们一起吃饭吧
You know, we should have dinner one night with you and Leonard.

389
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,462
我们太乐意了
Oh, we would love that.

390
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:49,252
太棒了
Great!

391
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:52,512
-晚安了  两位  -好的  晚安
- Okay, good night, guys. - All right, night.

392
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,012
拜
Bye.

393
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:56,792
-我讨厌她  -我讨厌她
- I hate her. - I hate her.

394
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,199
我真的很失望  我们不能开一家
I'm really disappointed we're not gonna have

395
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:06,149
-自己的漫画书店  -是啊
- our own comic book store. - I know.

396
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,349
我本来满心期待
I was looking forward to it.

397
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:10,349
能开一家自己的漫画书店多好啊
It would've been so nice to have a place that was ours,

398
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,269
我们可以安静地坐着在里面看漫画书
where we could just sit and read comics in peace.

399
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:14,589
有舒服的座位
With comfy seats.

400
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:15,969
还有零食
And snacks.

401
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,209
唉  哪有这么好的事啊
Well, I guess it was too good to be true.

402
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:19,699
没错
Yeah.
