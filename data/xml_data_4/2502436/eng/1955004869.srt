1
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,988
What are you drawing
over there?

2
00:00:04,989 --> 00:00:07,540
A hypothetical containment field

3
00:00:07,542 --> 00:00:09,592
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole

4
00:00:09,594 --> 00:00:12,662
that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

5
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,831
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

6
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,684
You know,
a lot of scientists believe

7
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,353
that making contact
with other life-forms

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,305
would probably not
end well for us.

9
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:24,690
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole,
Leonard.

10
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,275
You can block it with a Frisbee.

11
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:27,527
Calm down.

12
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,982
Do you expect me
to build this?

13
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,618
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

14
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:39,705
Have you guys ever noticed
that Sheldon

15
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,375
always disappears every day
at 2:45?

16
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:43,409
Really?

17
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,744
He probably just goes
to the bathroom.

18
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:46,195
Actually, no,
he goes to the bathroom

19
00:00:46,197 --> 00:00:47,914
at 8:00 a.m.
with optional follow-ups

20
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:52,034
at 1:45 and 7:10
on high-fiber Fridays.

21
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,670
It's sad that
you know that.

22
00:00:54,672 --> 00:00:57,840
Oh, that's just the tip
of the sadness iceberg.

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,894
I'm looking
at his public calendar.

24
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:05,097
2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

25
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,400
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05,
nothing.

26
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:08,935
Last week, nothing.

27
00:01:08,937 --> 00:01:10,086
Last month, nothing.

28
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:12,822
He never has anything booked
during that time.

29
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:15,858
20 minutes a day,
completely unaccounted for.

30
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,894
We should figure out
where he goes.

31
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,895
Ooh, this is exciting.

32
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:21,831
Like one of my classic

33
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,616
murder mystery
dinner parties.

34
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:25,618
Right, the case of
who murdered

35
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,620
three Saturday nights
of my life?

36
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,456
Colonel Koothrapali
in ten

37
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:32,675
with the olive spread.

38
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,296

Original Air Date on November 15, 2012

48
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:06,169

49
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:07,929
So, how was work today?

50
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,796
Well, I spent most
of the afternoon growing

51
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:12,799
isotopically pure crystals
for neutrino detection.

52
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:17,454
That sounds like fun.

53
00:02:17,456 --> 00:02:18,855
Yeah, it was.

54
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:20,857
Oh, good, I guessed right.

55
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,693
(phone chimes)

56
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:24,344
Who you talking to?

57
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,113
Oh, just this guy
I met at school.

58
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:29,015
Oh, great.
We're still dating, right?

59
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,735
Relax. He's just a friend.

60
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,070
We're doing
an oral report together.

61
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:34,287
He's really nice.

62
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,205
I'm sorry, what was that?

63
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:37,741
I had a little stroke
after "oral."

64
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:39,743
Would you stop?

65
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:40,827
(phone chimes)

66
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,546
Look, he just moved here
from London, okay?

67
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:43,697
He doesn't really know anybody.

68
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,916
Oh, good, an English accent,

69
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:47,367
the sexiest accent you can have.

70
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,585
No.

71
00:02:48,587 --> 00:02:49,869
That's not true.

72
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:52,556
There's French, there's Italian.

73
00:02:52,558 --> 00:02:55,542
No, you're right, it's the best.

74
00:02:55,544 --> 00:02:57,177
Did you tell him
you have a boyfriend?

75
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:58,428
It didn't come up.

76
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,147
Well, maybe you should tell him.

77
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,932
What am I supposed to say?

78
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:03,216
Say, "Can't talk right now.

79
00:03:03,218 --> 00:03:04,384
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

80
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,720
England sucks, you suck,
USA number one."

81
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:11,891
Fine.

82
00:03:11,893 --> 00:03:13,610
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

83
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,529
Talk to you later."

84
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:16,663
Happy?

85
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,031
Yes. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,250
(phone chimes)

87
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,536
(suppressed giggle)

88
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,789
What did he say?

89
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,240
Nothing.

90
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,508
What?

91
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,678
"Did your boyfriend make
you type that?"

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,887
I hate this guy.

93
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,092
Don't be like that.

94
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,094
Come on, trust me,
he's hitting on you.

95
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,362
No, he's not.
We're just friends.

96
00:03:49,364 --> 00:03:50,781
Look, is this gonna be
a problem?

97
00:03:50,783 --> 00:03:52,532
Because he's supposed
to come over tomorrow to work.

98
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,367
Really? Here?
(sighs)

99
00:03:54,369 --> 00:03:56,436
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I'll switch partners,

100
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:58,155
even though
the thing's due next week

101
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,073
and everyone already
has a partner

102
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,108
and I'll probably end up
failing the class.

103
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,710
That'd be great. Thank you.

104
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,467
2:44,
right on schedule.

105
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:11,668
Hey, Sheldon.

106
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,286
Oh, hello.

107
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:15,455
Raj and I
are heading over

108
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:18,425
to the genetics lab to pet
the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

109
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,061
Want to come with us?
No, thank you.

110
00:04:21,063 --> 00:04:22,596
Are you sure? They
turn off the lights,

111
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:23,980
and it's like a cute
little laser show

112
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:26,183
that poops all
over the place.

113
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:28,602
I'm quite sure. Good day.

114
00:04:28,604 --> 00:04:30,103
Well, where
are you going?

115
00:04:30,105 --> 00:04:31,655
Where are you going?
We just told you.

116
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,356
I just told you.
No, you didn't.

117
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:35,859
Well, it's your word against
mine; see you in court.

118
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:41,081
Should we follow him?

119
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,199
I don't know, I'm torn.

120
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:43,416
I want to know
where he's going,

121
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,836
but now I kind of want
to play with the bunny.

122
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:48,672
Hi, guys.

123
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:50,841
Hey, Alex, do you know
where your boss just went?

124
00:04:50,843 --> 00:04:51,708
No.

125
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,826
Don't you know
his schedule?

126
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:55,428
All I know is corduroy
makes too much noise

127
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,631
and I have to go find
"quieter pants."

128
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:03,436
Come on.

129
00:05:03,438 --> 00:05:05,305
Boy, what I wouldn't give

130
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,891
to get her out of those pants...

131
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:10,343
and into something
a little more stylish.

132
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,289
(door closes)

133
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,693
This is where
he goes?

134
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:28,495
What's in there?

135
00:05:28,497 --> 00:05:30,080
I think it's
an old storage room.

136
00:05:30,082 --> 00:05:34,467
What could he be doing in there
every day for 20 minutes?

137
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:36,419
Well, he's not doing
20-minute abs,

138
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:39,639
because if he were,
he would have way better abs.

139
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,394
(quietly):
Can you hear anything?

140
00:05:44,396 --> 00:05:46,847
Not yet.

141
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,927
(whispering):
What are you doing?

142
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:03,196
I'm listening.

143
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,533
Can't you face the
other way and listen?

144
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:09,569
I can't do anything right
for you, can I?

145
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:11,805
What the hell
is he up to?

146
00:06:11,807 --> 00:06:14,424
He is kind of a weirdo.

147
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:17,043
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

148
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:18,461
Or Bill Gates.

149
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,597
Or Stephen Hawking.

150
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,801
Why would he chain
up Stephen Hawking?

151
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:27,304
Howard, please, you can't treat
the man differently

152
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:30,056
just because he's disabled.
That's not okay.

153
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,261
If you're wondering why

154
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,596
I've been staring
through the peephole,

155
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:38,315
I'm trying to get a look
at this guy

156
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:39,950
who's coming over to Penny's.

157
00:06:39,952 --> 00:06:44,037
To be honest,
I didn't know you were here.

158
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,273
It's not a big deal.

159
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,540
He's just in her history class.

160
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,075
They're working
on a project together.

161
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:50,577
I don't even know why I care.

162
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,745
You know what, I don't care.

163
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:54,347
You think <i>you</i> don't care.

164
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:56,800
This is silly.

165
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:59,002
I have nothing
to worry about.

166
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:02,956
Oh, I don't know.

167
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,224
Statistically speaking,

168
00:07:04,226 --> 00:07:06,409
I'm sure you have something
to worry about.

169
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,127
What do you mean?

170
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,098
Well, if we assume
your looks are average,

171
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,800
right off the bat,

172
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:16,937
50% of men on Earth
are more attractive than you.

173
00:07:19,073 --> 00:07:22,475
That's 1.5 billion
handsome lads standing by,

174
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,911
waiting to rain on your parade.

175
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:28,832
Well, yeah, but this
isn't just about looks.

176
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

177
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:34,287
Not height, vision, athleticism,

178
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:37,824
or ability
to digest dairy products.

179
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,159
I'm talking
about important things

180
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,013
like emotional maturity.

181
00:07:43,015 --> 00:07:46,433
You were just spying on your
girlfriend through a peephole.

182
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:49,502
I liked it better
when you thought I wasn't here.

183
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:53,390
I'm not saying you don't
have attractive qualities.

184
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:55,859
Your choice of friends
is impeccable,

185
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:57,811
you're a good sleeper.

186
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:59,813
And last but not least,

187
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:03,400
you buy the grapes I like.

188
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:05,702
You're a real catch

189
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:07,487
compared to some snoring guy

190
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:10,623
with a fridge full
of lousy grapes.

191
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,792
None of this matters.

192
00:08:12,794 --> 00:08:14,544
I trust that Penny cares
about me,

193
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:16,629
and nothing's gonna happen
with this guy.

194
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, unless of course
he's a skilled hypnotist.

195
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,719
What?

196
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:26,072
While unlikely, it's still
a statistical possibility.

197
00:08:26,074 --> 00:08:27,240
She might be performing

198
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:31,261
sexual acts with him
and not even know it.

199
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:34,380
Now you're just being
ridiculous.

200
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,815
Am I?

201
00:08:35,817 --> 00:08:38,068
The mind's
a mysterious thing, Leonard.

202
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,670
He could be having
the time of his life

203
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:43,907
while she thinks she's
a chicken pecking for corn.

204
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:57,570
Look at us, sneaking around
in the middle of the night

205
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:01,291
like a couple
of cat burglars.

206
00:09:01,293 --> 00:09:03,176
I think we're more
like ninjas.

207
00:09:03,178 --> 00:09:06,412
I don't want to be a ninja;
I want to be a cat burglar.

208
00:09:06,414 --> 00:09:09,883
Fine, I'll be a ninja,
you be a cat burglar.

209
00:09:09,885 --> 00:09:12,018
No, we both have to
be the same thing.

210
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,589
Okay, we're ninjas.

211
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:18,141
Thank you.

212
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,061
But next time, we'll
be cat burglars.

213
00:09:27,284 --> 00:09:29,319
It's locked.
Are you sure?

214
00:09:29,321 --> 00:09:31,821
Yes, I'm sure.

215
00:09:31,823 --> 00:09:33,773
Now, you stand guard,
I'm going to...

216
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:40,163
It's locked.

217
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:41,948
Just keep an eye out.

218
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,800
I'll have this open
in a minute.

219
00:09:43,802 --> 00:09:45,969
When did you learn
how to pick locks?

220
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:48,555
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high,

221
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:51,591
I thought I could be
an escape artist

222
00:09:51,593 --> 00:09:53,393
like Harry Houdini.

223
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,394
How did that work out?

224
00:09:54,396 --> 00:09:55,512
Pretty good.

225
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,263
I managed to escape friends,
popularity,

226
00:09:57,265 --> 00:10:00,633
and every party thrown
in a 12-mile radius.

227
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,735
There. Ready?

228
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:04,521
Hold on, hold on.
What?

229
00:10:04,523 --> 00:10:06,689
Sheldon is a very smart man,

230
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,942
and he obviously wants
to keep this a secret.

231
00:10:08,944 --> 00:10:10,026
Yeah, so?

232
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,829
What if it's
booby-trapped?

233
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:16,833
Don't worry, I'm one
step ahead of him.

234
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:18,651
Great, what's your pl...

235
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,175
Are we good?

236
00:10:25,177 --> 00:10:27,644
(sadly):
Yeah.

237
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:36,002
Huh.

238
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:37,720
Forty-three.

239
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,673
What the hell
does that mean?

240
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,025
I don't know.

241
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,010
The solution to an equation?

242
00:10:44,012 --> 00:10:45,445
Maybe.

243
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:46,980
It's a prime number.

244
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:50,950
Encryption systems
are built on prime numbers.

245
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:53,903
What kind of secret does
Sheldon have to encrypt?

246
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:55,121
He's always been
very cagey

247
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:57,157
about what he puts
in his egg salad

248
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,326
to make it so tasty.

249
00:11:02,146 --> 00:11:05,498
It's paprika.

250
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,916
Really?

251
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:09,085
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

252
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,656
MAN (with English accent):
Okay, good night.

253
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:14,807
PENNY:
Thanks, Cole.

254
00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:15,808
See you at school.

255
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,143
COLE:
See you.

256
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,411
(door closes)

257
00:11:18,413 --> 00:11:20,813
I'll be right back.

258
00:11:20,815 --> 00:11:23,416
I thought you left
a long time ago.

259
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,727
What's up?

260
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,030
Hey.

261
00:11:37,032 --> 00:11:41,417
You moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

262
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:44,070
No, I was just visiting
a friend.

263
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,338
Oh, cool.

264
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,706
That cute blonde on four?

265
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,091
Yeah. You know her?

266
00:11:48,093 --> 00:11:49,959
I, well,
I see her around.

267
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,095
I like to keep my distance

268
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:55,765
because her boyfriend
is a pretty scary dude.

269
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,300
Really?

270
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,085
Yeah.

271
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:02,255
He's ganged up.

272
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,307
She told me
he's a scientist.

273
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:07,694
That's the name of his gang.

274
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:12,315
The Scientists.

275
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,652
They are crazy.

276
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,537
Well, thanks for the tip.

277
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,106
No problem, brother.
Stay frosty.

278
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,237
We're still dating, right?

279
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.

280
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:50,292
Hey, Alex,
and call me Leonard.

281
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:51,811
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

282
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,329
And my mother.

283
00:12:54,347 --> 00:12:55,848
And my sister.

284
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,684
And our cat.

285
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:01,387
Although, I'm pretty sure

286
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,807
Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree
was honorary.

287
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:07,426
May I join you, Leonard?

288
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:09,278
Sure.
Thanks.

289
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,697
Hey, Alex,
let me ask you something.

290
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,483
My girlfriend
knows this guy at school.

291
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:16,485
He's got an English accent.

292
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,454
Ooh, I love English accents.

293
00:13:18,456 --> 00:13:21,240
Yeah, you all do.

294
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:24,043
Anyway, I feel like
he's hitting on her.

295
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,112
She says he's just being nice
and that I should trust her.

296
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,664
It's probably harmless.

297
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,832
You know how it is.

298
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:32,802
I'm sure you get hit on
all the time.

299
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:36,355
Right.

300
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,257
Because girls are always like,

301
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:40,342
"Ooh, that guy owns
two Star Trek uniforms

302
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:42,011
"and gets a lot
of ear infections.

303
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:44,763
I got to get me some of that."

304
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,932
I don't know,

305
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,651
I bet it happens
more than you realize.

306
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,069
Trust me, it doesn't.

307
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:51,604
You sure?

308
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:53,489
You're cute, you're funny.

309
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:58,110
Maybe you're getting hit on,
and you don't even know it.

310
00:13:58,112 --> 00:13:59,578
Really?

311
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,199
I'm pretty sure.

312
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,653
(laughing)

313
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:10,172
Okay, I got to get back to work.

314
00:14:10,174 --> 00:14:12,725
Thanks for listening.

315
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,093
No problem.

316
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:16,995
Hope-hope no girls rip my
clothes off on the way.

317
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:19,181
(laughing)

318
00:14:20,383 --> 00:14:23,569
Come on,
we're smart guys.

319
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,504
We can figure this out.
Forty-three.

320
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,107
What is 43?

321
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:32,027
Besides my mom's neck size.

322
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:36,482
It's the atomic number
for technetium.

323
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,684
That stuff's radioactive.

324
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:41,070
Do you think
he's building a bomb?

325
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,988
It took him two years
to put together

326
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,623
that Lego Death Star;
I'm not worried.

327
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,094
Ooh, this could be something.

328
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,463
43 is the number of calories

329
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:55,167
in half a cup
of fat-free yogurt.

330
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,670
Why would you know that?

331
00:14:57,672 --> 00:14:59,037
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,608
We can't all eat whatever
we want and still stay thin.

333
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,514
Wait, in the <i>Hitchhikers</i>
<i>Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

334
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,349
isn't 43 the answer
to the question

335
00:15:10,351 --> 00:15:12,551
of life, the universe,
and everything?

336
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,487
That's 42, dumb-ass.

337
00:15:15,489 --> 00:15:17,022
Hey, hey.

338
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:19,275
Feelings.

339
00:15:19,277 --> 00:15:22,061
We should stop.

340
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:24,029
I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.

341
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,598
We've got more
important things to do.

342
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,399
Who cares what
stupid 43 means?

343
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:29,568
Not me.
Let's go home.

344
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,972
You want
to get something to eat?

345
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,040
Sounds good.

346
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,794
What the balls is 43?!

347
00:15:38,796 --> 00:15:40,930
I have to know!

348
00:15:45,268 --> 00:15:46,602
Hi.

349
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:49,722
Hey, shouldn't you be out
with your gang,

350
00:15:49,724 --> 00:15:53,025
spray painting equations
on the side of buildings?

351
00:15:53,027 --> 00:15:55,861
Come on, I'm sorry.

352
00:15:55,863 --> 00:15:57,529
I just can't believe
you don't trust me.

353
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:58,901
I do, of course I do.

354
00:15:58,926 --> 00:16:01,026
Then why did you embarrass me
in front of my friend,

355
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:03,118
who, by the way,
knew exactly who you were?

356
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,789
Really?
Your picture's on my refrigerator.

357
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,125
Oh.

358
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:13,329
You know, I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

359
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:14,946
What is your problem?

360
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:16,882
Do you use up
all your thinking at work

361
00:16:16,884 --> 00:16:19,001
and then have none left over
for when you get home?

362
00:16:19,003 --> 00:16:20,552
I don't know.

363
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,121
It's hard sometimes.

364
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,473
Everywhere you go,

365
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:27,393
guys hit on you, even if
I'm standing right there.

366
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:28,594
And they're all taller than me.

367
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,180
Why is everyone taller
than me?

368
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,098
You know what,

369
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,683
this is all in my head.

370
00:16:34,685 --> 00:16:36,518
It's my problem, not yours.

371
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,070
Leonard, why do you
always do this?

372
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:39,822
Listen to me,
you're the one I'm with.

373
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,157
You know I love you,
so will you please relax

374
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:43,993
because you're driving me crazy.

375
00:16:50,924 --> 00:16:53,893
You know that's the first time
you ever said that you love me.

376
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,880
Yeah.

377
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:04,537
We're just supposed to
pretend it's not a big deal?

378
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:09,075
That's...

379
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:12,811
exactly what we're gonna do
because...

380
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:15,114
you're about to make me cry,

381
00:17:15,116 --> 00:17:18,034
and we both know
if I start crying,

382
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:21,487
you're gonna start crying.

383
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,923
(sniffling)
You're right, you should go.

384
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,042
(crying):
All right.

385
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,000
She loves me.

386
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,186
(phone chimes)

387
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,940
"Hey, it's Alex.

388
00:17:40,942 --> 00:17:42,258
"Nice having coffee with you.

389
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,160
"If you want to talk more,
I'm always available.

390
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,145
Smiley face, smiley face."

391
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:48,347
What a friendly girl.

392
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:55,237
Okay, picture's up.

393
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,989
Looks like the camera's working.

394
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,457
That's good quality video.

395
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:01,777
It better be. It's the spare
camera for the Mars rover.

396
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:04,080
How did you get
your hands on that?

397
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:05,831
Million dollar camera--

398
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:07,800
ten dollar lock.

399
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,836
KOOTHRAPPALI: Oh, my God,
here he comes.

400
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:12,722
This is it.

401
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,815
What the hell
is that thing?

402
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:23,999
I don't know.

403
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,551
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

404
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:27,503
Experimental log.

405
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:32,274
Wormhole generator test 44.

406
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:35,277
Wormhole generator test?

407
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:41,450
The first 43 parallel universes

408
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,703
I've checked proved to be empty.

409
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,372
I see no reason to suspect

410
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:49,625
universe number 44
will be any different.

411
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:57,082
Oh, my God!

412
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,918
Holy crap!

413
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,938
(screaming)

414
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:08,310
Oh! It's eating my face!

415
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,945
Aah! It's eating his face!

416
00:19:09,947 --> 00:19:12,198
(screaming)

417
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,793
I found your Webcam
and replaced the video feed.

418
00:19:18,795 --> 00:19:21,329
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

419
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:23,014
Sheldon, we're really sorry.

420
00:19:23,016 --> 00:19:24,299
Yeah, really sorry.

421
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:25,533
Sorry?

422
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:26,918
You may not realize it,

423
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,471
but I have difficulty navigating
certain aspects of daily life.

424
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,257
You know,
understanding sarcasm,

425
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,759
feigning interest in others,

426
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:38,730
not talking about trains
as much as I want to.

427
00:19:38,732 --> 00:19:40,315
It's exhausting.

428
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:42,900
Which is why,
for 20 minutes a day,

429
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:44,686
I like to go down to that room,

430
00:19:44,688 --> 00:19:45,970
turn my mind off

431
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:48,389
and do what I need to do
to recharge.

432
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,475
But what are you doing in there?

433
00:19:51,477 --> 00:19:53,144
And what does 43 mean?

434
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:54,545
You don't need to know,

435
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:56,080
you don't deserve to know,

436
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,249
and you will never know.

437
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,960
(sighs)

438
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,333
One, two, three, four,

439
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:56,221
five, six, seven, eight...

440
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,218
Drat.

441
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,663
I'm never going to get
to 43 again.

442
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,968
One, two, three, four...

443
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:08,896
Rats.

444
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:13,897
