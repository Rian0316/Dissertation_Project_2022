1
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,880

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,420
I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,230
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,490
Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,150
had been entirely focused on elimination.

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,560
Now they have a delightful social aspect.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,460
Amy, you must've been in the bathroom

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,540
with other women before.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,760
Of course I have.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,660
But they were strangers and seemed off-put

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,350
when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,950
Some women don't like to get chummy

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,730
when their panties are down.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,350
You okay in there, bestie?

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,630
I'm fine...

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,970
The reason I ask is that many people

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,590
experience bladder shyness;

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,180
the inability to pass uri...

19
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,150
Yeah, I said I'm fine. Stop talking to me.

20
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,220
She always this crabby when she urinates?

21
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,070
We're really not that close.

22
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,560
Screw it. I'll go later.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,750
And I'll be right by your side.

24
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,710
Did I tell you Priya invited

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,840
me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,300
Oh, that's nice.

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,510
No, it's not.

28
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,830
It's a strategic maneuver.

29
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,050
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty

30
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,190
to you and the group.

31
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,550
That bitch is crafty.

32
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,150
- You think? - Of course.

33
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,490
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?

34
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,360
By going after its weakest member.

35
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,340
Well, what makes me the weakest member?

36
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,060
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.

37
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,710
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.

38
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,710

39
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,960
Okay, Amy, you're being silly.

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,320
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.

41
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,620
And I certainly don't have a problem

42
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,580
with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.

43
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,970
Ooh, these are cute.

44
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,270
Of course if I buy them,

45
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,290
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.

46
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,110
It doesn't matter. I'm going to tell her we can't make it.

47
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,900
Oh, no. You <i>have</i> to go.

48
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,810
I don't understand.

49
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,280
I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.

50
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,270
You are-- with hair that smells like strawberries.

51
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,370
And we're going to use that to our advantage.

52
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,790
Wait. What are you talking about?

53
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,860
By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,180
a double agent inside the enemy camp.

55
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,830
She could ferret out Priya's tactics,

56
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,930
identify her weaknesses

57
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,280
and feed her false information, such as:

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Leonard's no stranger to back-alley cockfights.

59
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,620
I don't know. I'm not a very good liar.

60
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,200
They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.

61
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,900
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,170
I did two years of Cub Scouts

63
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,100
before they found out I was a girl.

64
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,280
Okay, I don't know you people.

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,720
I'm just an innocent woman wondering

66
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,410
if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.

67
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,720
How do you feel about concealing a recording device

68
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,930
in the cleavage of your ample bosom?

69
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,560
I don't want anything in my ample bosom.

70
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,670
Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.

71
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,340
- Okay, see you later. - Good news.

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,100
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,030
That is good news. Bye.

74
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,400
Uh, do you know how I solved

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,960
the balanced center combat-area problem?

76
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,990
Five words:

77
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,960
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.

78
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,540
That... that's brilliant.

79
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,870
It's what I do.

80
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,610
But wait, there's more.

81
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,780
I also invented two new chess pieces.

82
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,420
The serpent... and the old woman.

83
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,720
Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?

84
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,710
When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece,

85
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,800
that piece is considered poisoned

86
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,310
and will die after two more moves.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,970
All right.

88
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,550
Unless... it gets to the old woman in time,

89
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,380
in which case she sucks out the poison,

90
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,160
turning her into the Grand Empress:

91
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,000
a piece combining the power

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,050
of the Knight, Queen and Serpent.

93
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,350
Elegant.

94
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,030
That's because it's simple.

95
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,930
Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.

96
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,980
And...

97
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,540
And what?

98
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,670
And a third person.

99
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,090
It's three-person chess.

100
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,590
I must say, ever since you started

101
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,640
having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge.

102
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,780
You should reflect on that.

103
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,020
Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.

104
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,860
Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces.

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,930
If he hadn't been such a hound dog,

106
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,110
we'd all have time machines.

107
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,910
Got it. Bye.

108
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,590
You know I'm right.

109
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,640
I think he's getting worse.

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,060
Oh, my metatarsal are barking.

111
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:24,790
- You okay? Yeah, yeah.

112
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,540
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.

113
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,590
- Very pretty. - Thank you.

114
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,940
Did you know that women wear high heels

115
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,270
to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?

116
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,390
Hadn't really thought about it.

117
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,910
Look.

118
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,370
Uh, sure. Very... prominent.

119
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,030
Please, Leonard, don't leer,

120
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,060
you have a girlfriend.

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,820
Sorry.

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,890
So, are you off to dinner

123
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,420
with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?

124
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,320
Yeah. How did you know?

125
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,130
I heard it at the mall,

126
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,480
when I was shopping with my girlfriends,

127
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,630
'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now.

128
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,800
Have a good night.

129
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,750
Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,240
Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,900
The lonely guy and the two happy couples?

132
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,220
I'd rather get a prostate exam

133
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,880
from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.

134
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,350
Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?

135
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,830
I have to feel sorry for myself.

136
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,530
I'm the only one who cares.

137
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,690
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.

138
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,060
Really? In front of your sister?

139
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,400
We shared a room growing up.

140
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,630
This is not news to me.

141
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,930
Excuse me. I'm going to go wander the streets alone.

142
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,200
Invisible, unwanted and unloved.

143
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,620
A pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.

144
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,980
I forgot my windbreaker. It'chilly.

145
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,520
I don't understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?

146
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,630
No. Once these puppies touch the ground

147
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,960
they're mine, and I'll have to wear them

148
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,490
walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard

149
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,260
in order to pay them off.

150
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,560
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

151
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,800
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.

152
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,420
The what?

153
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,670
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.

154
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,020
Message received.

155
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,270
Commence operation "Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."

156
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,700
Hey. Seriously?

157
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,130
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?

158
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,200
I wish. A clique requires friends.

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,690
- I didn't have any. - None?

160
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,050
I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room

161
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,460
and eat with the janitor.

162
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,710
It was nice until his wife called me a <i>puta</i>

163
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,210
and made me stop.

164
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,720
Hang on.

165
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,540
It's the wildebeest.

166
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,030
Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.

167
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,100
W-What the hell did she say?

168
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
She thinks it's cool you're following your dream,

169
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,550
no matter what.

170
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,790
That bitch!

171
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,470
How do you want to handle it?

172
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:10,750
Um, okay.

173
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,390
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that

174
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,230
I'm on my way to Prague

175
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,760
to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.

176
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,860
Got it.

177
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,080
Is it going to be in 3-D?

178
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,110
What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

179
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,280
I'm gonna say 3-D.

180
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,700
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.

181
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,510
You're kidding. 3-D?

182
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,230
That's what I hear.

183
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,960
Then the studio must have real faith in it.

184
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,080
Wonder why she didn't <i>tell</i> me.

185
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,340
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?

186
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,680
No...

187
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,650
Then why are you surprised she didn't tell you?

188
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,280
Well, it's not as much "surprised" as...

189
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,550
you know... uh... the other thing.

190
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,040
What other thing?

191
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,470
Well, if you... uh...

192
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,100
I don't... oh...

193
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,910
What's the word I'm looking for?

194
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,290
I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.

195
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,900
She's also dating an astronaut.

196
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,830
Wow. That's very impressive.

197
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,180
Yeah. But Leonard's impressive, too.

198
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,470
Thank you.

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,630
"Befuddled."

200
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,340
The word I was looking for was "befuddled."

201
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,940
Knight to Old Woman...

202
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:49,390
six-and-a-third.

203
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,090
Brilliant move.

204
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:05,000
Thank you.

205
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,680
Will the two of you excuse me?

206
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,000
I need a hug.

207
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,910
Sorry, I have company.

208
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
Come on, Sheldon, open the door.

209
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,140
I don't want to hug you.

210
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,220
I don't want to hug you, either.

211
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,060
I was just feeling blue.

212
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,480
Blue, as in depressed.

213
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,930
Well, not so much depressed as lonely.

214
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't know what color lonely is.

215
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,860
- What? - Red is angry;

216
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,290
yellow is frightened;

217
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,380
green is jealous; and blue is depressed.

218
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,560
Perhaps we can assign a color to lonely.

219
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,320
Nothing rhymes with orange. It's probably lonely.

220
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,840
All right. Come in.

221
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,630
You look positively orange with loneliness.

222
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,440
No, I don't see that catching on at all.

223
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,050
What are you doing?

224
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm working on my three-person chess game.

225
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,870
Oh, cool. Can I play?

226
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,580
It's three-person chess.

227
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,170
Did you bring a friend?

228
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:20,950
No.

229
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,570
Then as a mental exercise I invite you

230
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,810
to figure out why the two of us

231
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,880
can't play three-person chess.

232
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,540
Can you believe this guy?

233
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,650
Social protocol does, however,

234
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,510
require me to bring you a hot beverage

235
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,730
in your time of need.

236
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,800
No, thank you. I'm fine.

237
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,660
It's not optional.

238
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,530
We're out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.

239
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,350
I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering

240
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,520
what's got me down.

241
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,370
Actually, I was wondering

242
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,070
if I could add a third new chess piece.

243
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,300
How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey--

244
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,310
the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?

245
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
I'm going to be 30 years old,

246
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,550
and I have no one in my life to love me.

247
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman

248
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,600
without having alcohol in my body.

249
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,350
The fun thing about Prince Joey

250
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,600
is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance

251
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,570
he'll kill himself.

252
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,760
Sheldon, listen to me.

253
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,760
I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared.

254
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,200
Yellow. Go ahead.

255
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,410
A friend at the School of Pharmacology

256
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,080
gave me these new pills they're testing.

257
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,490
He says it's the next big thing

258
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,330
for social anxiety disorder.

259
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,770
Fascinating. What's in it?

260
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,650
I'm not sure.

261
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,950
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule

262
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,440
extracted from the urine of cows.

263
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,690
I like cows.

264
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,460
That's not the point.

265
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,420
It was its own point. Go on.

266
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm a scientist.

267
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,000
My ability to think is my bread and butter.

268
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,620
I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose

269
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,740
that special, unique something

270
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,230
that makes me so successful in my field.

271
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,650
Rajesh, I've had the privilege

272
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,740
of working alongside you for many years.

273
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,380
My recommendation is that

274
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,080
you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,290
Okay, I'm still trying to work this out.

276
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,600
How did Penny meet an astronaut?

277
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,460
I don't know.

278
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,880
The regular way people meet astronauts.

279
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,960
Most of those guys live in Texas.

280
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,550
Obviously, this one doesn't.

281
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,870
Okay.

282
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,520
Leonard lives here. Priya's from India.

283
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,900
People meet, Howard. God!

284
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,940
Fine.

285
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,340
You've met lots of astronauts,

286
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,560
and I've never grilled you about that.

287
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,690
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.

288
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,750
I'm not grilling you; I was just curious.

289
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,630
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.

290
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:59,150
Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't.

291
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,150
Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?

292
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,210
I'm sorry. What would an astronaut be doing

293
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,870
working on a movie?

294
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,590
He's a consultant.

295
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,680
I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna.

296
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
He can't have a hobby?!

297
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,450
Excuse me, I have to pee.

298
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,130
Or is that implausible, as well?!

299
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,130
It's nice to have another couple to hang with, isn't it?

300
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,570
All right, guys, you have to go back.

301
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,980
I can't afford you.

302
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,570
No, don't send us away; we love you.

303
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,840
I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent.

304
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,310
But, Penny, you look so good in us.

305
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,770
Damn it, the shoes are right.

306
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,410
Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.

307
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,950
What do you got for me, wildebeest?

308
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,340
I think they're on to me.

309
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,450
The story's starting to fall apart.

310
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,410
Calm down. Everything's going to be okay.

311
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,090
We may have to kill her.

312
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,450
Bernadette, I'm putting you on speakerphone.

313
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,270
Where are you now?

314
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,320
In the bathroom.

315
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,260
Oh, look at this,

316
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,810
another one of our classic bathroom gabfests.

317
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,410
What's the problem?

318
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,210
They're just asking me

319
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,510
all sorts of questions I can't answer.

320
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:25,250
Just change the subject.

321
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,220
I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard

322
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,600
going to India to meet Priya's parents.

323
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,300
What?!

324
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,570
They said something about going there this summer.

325
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,310
What, are they getting engaged?

326
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,200
I don't know. I was too busy covering my heinie

327
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
on Amy's stupid astronaut story!

328
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,580
What astronaut story?

329
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,740
You texted me Penny's dating an astronaut.

330
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,510
I texted "architect." That's amusing.

331
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,460
Auto-correct must've changed it.

332
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,390
Yeah, it's hysterical.

333
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,040
All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.

334
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,370
Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?

335
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,180
Look, just find out what's up with this trip to India.

336
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,590
I don't want to do this anymore!

337
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,280
Don't you quit on us!

338
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,580
Bernie, you okay?

339
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,070
It was an architect!

340
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,310
Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon.

341
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,470
You're a good friend.

342
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,870
I'm glad you think so.

343
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,130
That's what I strive to emulate.

344
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,230
Okay, let's see if this drug works.

345
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,400
Can I help you?

346
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,090
Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.

347
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,030
Thank you.

348
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,030
That's a great accent. Where are you from?

349
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,880
India.

350
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,380
Oh, cool. I've always wanted to go there.

351
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,330
It's a beautiful country. You'd love it.

352
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,210
May I join you?

353
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,040
Uh, okay, sure. Why not?

354
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,650
My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali,

355
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,940
and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

356
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,740
There's no need to interact with me.

357
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,580
I'm just here to observe.

358
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,900
What's he observing?

359
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,470
We're scientists. We observe everything.

360
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,210
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

361
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,060
All right.

362
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,470
- And what is your name? - Angela.

363
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,040
Oh, derived from the word "angel." Appropriate.

364
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,770
You're cute.

365
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,750
I'd like to buy a scone.

366
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,010
Oh, I'm sorry, we're out.

367
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,260
We have muffins.

368
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,620
They sound delicious,

369
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,510
but this money is earmarked for scones.

370
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,450
What are you doing?!

371
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,160
Oh, just getting comfortable.

372
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,480
So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?

373
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,140
I...

374
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,380
They were out of scones.

375
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,710
Sheldon, I'm talking to someone.

376
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,100
You're being rude.

377
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,770
I'll bet you're an actress.

378
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,990
If not, you should be.

379
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,670
You have a very expressive face.

380
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,170
Oh, my God.

381
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,010
Wait, where are you going?

382
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,470
We were doing so well.

383
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,260
She never even got to see my penis.

384
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,160
Who wants some more coffee?

385
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,730
- Thanks, yeah. - Sure.

386
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,910
Let me help you.

387
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,580
Nice to see that the gals are getting along.

388
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,200
"Gals"?

389
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,300
Who are you, Fred Flintstone?

390
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,750
This trip to India sounds fun.

391
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,490
Yeah, I think it will be.

392
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,350
Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?

393
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,490
A little.

394
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,140
They're very old-fashioned.

395
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,910
Well, I wouldn't worry about it.

396
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,540
It's not like you guys are getting engaged, right?

397
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,830
Oh, God, no. We're not there yet.

398
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,790
Not engaged. Very interesting.

399
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,880
I have to tinkle.

400
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,700
You've been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?

401
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,380
Yes. Are you writing a book?

402
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,450
Why are you getting upset?

403
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,570
I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.

404
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,660
What's up with you?

405
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,010
Bernadette?

406
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,790
I can't do this anymore!

407
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,910
I'm a good girl!

408
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,060
I went to Catholic school!

409
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,180
Okay, well, it's getting late.

410
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,570
This was terrific.

411
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,290
You win.

412
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,200
Bernie?

413
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,980
I think the word you're looking for is "befuddled."

414
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,300
My catapult flings my bishop

415
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,830
to Howard's Queen's Gorilla two.

416
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,520
Nice.

417
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,860
Okay, Rook to transporter pad.

418
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,680
And he comes out at...

419
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,680
...Leonard's Queen's Bishop five-and-a-third.

420
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,440
Check on Leonard.

421
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,000
Hang on.

422
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,130
When is my Pawn allowed to use the golf cart?

423
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,020
When it's done charging.

424
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,930
Or you land on the time machine.

425
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,880
Obviously.

426
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,330
Beekeeper to King 12.

427
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,680
I capture your Pope and release the Swarm.

428
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,040
Checkmate on Sheldon.

429
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,710
I knew I should've given my Pope the jet pack.

430
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,540
Hey, I've got winners.
