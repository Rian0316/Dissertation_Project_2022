00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,974
When your Uncle Marshall was ten years old,

3
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,644
he read a book called Life Among the Gorillas.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:23,607
It was written by an anthropologist named Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vazquez,

5
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:28,862
and it told the story of the year she spent living among the Western Lowland Gorillas of Cameroon.

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:33,742
When Dr. Birnholz-Vazquez came to the local community college to give a lecture,

7
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,913
Marshall, the youngest member of the audience, raised his hand with a question.

8
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:41,583
What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?

9
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,460
So you want to be an anthropologist?

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,130
Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,967
What she said next changed his life.

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,095
Oh, that's wonderful, but I'm afraid you can't.

13
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,138
They'll all be dead by then.

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:01,103
...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced,

15
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,774
the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.

16
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,776
So you don't want coffee?

17
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,696
I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...

18
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,823
- All right. I'm pouring it out.
- Okay, one cup.

19
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,243
The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.

20
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,537
I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us.

21
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:21,039
"The kid" has become "the man."

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,500
Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,170
After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC.

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,963
They're gonna stop global warming.

25
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,465
Well... I mean... they did their best.

26
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,177
Here's your sack lunch.

27
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,181
Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch

28
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,058
and two, you laugh every time you say the word "sack".

29
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,811
- I love you, Marshmallow.
- I love you.

30
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,480
I love you too, Marshmallow.

31
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:48,358
Uh-oh.

32
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,610
Ted?

33
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,571
Oh, no. No, she didn't.

34
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,615
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

35
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,658
Another care package?

36
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,493
Another care package.

37
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,289
I'd been in a long-distance relationship with Victoria for nearly a month.

38
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,667
Long-distance relationships are a bad idea.

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,253
How many is that so far?

40
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,213
Three.

41
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,089
And how many have you sent her?

42
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,342
In the mail or in my mind?

43
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,969
Zero. She's up three-zip.

44
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,888
Oh! Cupcakes!

45
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,224
Great. I bet they're delicious, too.

46
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:24,019
Yup, they're delicious.

47
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,354
Damn it!

48
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,733
I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes.

49
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
God, I hate myself right now.

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,823
God, that is so me at 15.

51
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:42,913
Marshall was going to work for a big corporation called Altrucel.

52
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:47,334
Altrucel was most well-known for making the yellow fuzzy stuff on the surface of tennis balls.

53
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:50,712
I mean, this was a huge company, so they did other things...

54
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:56,426
But mostly they wanted the public to focus on the yellow fuzzy stuff.

55
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,680
Anyway, Marshall managed to score an internship in their legal department

56
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,640
because he knew someone who worked there.

57
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,518
Go for Barney.

58
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,020
Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security.

59
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,066
Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.

60
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,192
A sasquatch?

61
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,820
That's right, sir, a Bigfoot.

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,156
We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.

63
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,247
Yes!

64
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,748
Look at you.

65
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,668
You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.

66
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,297
Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.

67
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,342
Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...

68
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,635
There's one for awesomeness?

69
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,262
Yeah, I had it made.

70
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,680
Sit.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,392
Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?

72
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,768
Please.

73
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,937
- My dawg!
- My dawg!

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,481
Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal.

75
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,524
You're gonna be working with them.

76
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:53,901
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.

77
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,777
Nice tie. Steak sauce.

78
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,071
Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.

79
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,615
Where, I don't, I don't see...

80
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:01,116
Marshall? Sidebar.

81
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:08,874
Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.

82
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,753
Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside.

83
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,671
Ding dong! What? The doorbell?

84
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:18,175
Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else.

85
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:21,094
But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?

86
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:21,929
I don't have a back door.

87
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,474
Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise.

88
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:29,853
Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.

89
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,231
Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--

90
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:35,234
Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.

91
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,444
We're still engaged, even if she's...

92
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:41,490
Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.

93
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,079
Sure you don't want one?

94
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,747
How  many of those have you eaten?

95
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,125
Four. Teen. No, just four.

96
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,794
And the icing from two more.

97
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:57,381
So, anyway, here's the problem.

98
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,424
Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep.

99
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,846
Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great.

100
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,764
Here, listen...

101
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,725
Mmm. Mmm!

102
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:13,981
So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake...

103
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,234
And... I said something dumb.

104
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:20,404
Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail.

105
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,030
I sent it a couple days ago.

106
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,615
And it's awesome.

107
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,492
Really, really awesome.

108
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,369
Why did I say that?

109
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:30,163
I think frosting makes me lie.

110
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,249
Oh, Teddy boy.

111
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:36,628
Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her.

112
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,799
So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.

113
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,385
All right, here's what you do:

114
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,138
Put together a care package of stuff from New York--

115
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,183
some H&H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain...

116
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,603
and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready?

117
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,438
From three days ago.

118
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,356
That's  brilliant.

119
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,025
You're brilliant.

120
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,402
You know, it's funny, not so long ago,

121
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:03,572
I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.

122
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,115
That is funny.

123
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,201
And here's why it was funny.

124
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,453
Little did I realize, a few weeks earlier,

125
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,331
here's what Robin was saying to Lily about me.

126
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,750
Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.

127
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,712
Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.

128
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,172
The irony is clear, Ted.

129
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,054
Hey! How was your first day?

130
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,722
I don't wanna talk about it.

131
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,560
The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.

132
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,354
- What?
- They're jerks!

133
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,105
What makes them jerks?

134
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,191
Forget it, I don't want to talk about it.

135
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,360
Well, like today at lunch..

136
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,073
What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?

137
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,700
For your information, my fiancee did.

138
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,287
Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?

139
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,539
No.

140
00:07:00,671 --> 00:07:01,797
What's that?

141
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,840
Nothing.

142
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,007
Give it.

143
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,053
"Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad."

144
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:08,929
Give it.

145
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:13,892
P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it."

146
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,229
Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!

147
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,023
Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.

148
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,817
I know. God.

149
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,902
It's like freshman year all over again.

150
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,447
Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over.

151
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,283
Not even Old Reliable.

152
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:37,666
Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money,

153
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:41,253
but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.

154
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,838
I quit.

155
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,507
What? No. We're having so much fun.

156
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,509
You, me, working together. It's great.

157
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:51,096
We're  not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're...

158
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,973
Seriously, what is it that you do?

159
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,308
Please.

160
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,979
I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.

161
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,273
Oh, of course it's not for you.

162
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,317
It's for Lily.

163
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,235
What?

164
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,696
Marshall. Lily's a catch.

165
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:11,158
But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?

166
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,284
The package?

167
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:15,746
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school.

168
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,080
A vacation once in a while.

169
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,166
Lily doesn't care about that stuff.

170
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,961
Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years,

171
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,089
when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary

172
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:32,930
while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,893
She'll be happy.

174
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,061
Okay.

175
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:44,942
But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.

176
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:52,616
And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.

177
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,202
I guess, uh...

178
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,329
Bea Arthur.

179
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,499
Ahh! Wrong! Betty White.

180
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,126
Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.

181
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,299
So, did she get the awesome care package yet?

182
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,676
Yep. Yesterday.

183
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:11,802
Did she love it?

184
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,720
Ooh, she loved it.

185
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,305
So what's the problem?

186
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,559
So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you,

187
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,436
we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half.

188
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,856
Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.

189
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,693
What did you have for lunch today?

190
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,238
Oh. Rye bread.

191
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:39,997
Yeah.

192
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,463
Oh, Teddy boy.

193
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,718
I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch.

194
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,469
Maybe it just can't be done.

195
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,763
I think it's clear what I have to do.

196
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,183
It's pretty clear.

197
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:02,561
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.

198
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:05,564
Totally what I was thinking.

199
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,441
Get out of my head, man!

200
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,406
Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?

201
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,993
Marshall, consider the penguins.

202
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,411
The penguins?

203
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,579
On the wall.

204
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,130
"Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold."

205
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,840
This is a motivational poster?

206
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,218
Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy.

207
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:37,054
And you know why? Because you're different.

208
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:42,267
Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are,

209
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,730
or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.

210
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,028
Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.

211
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:55,822
Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled,

212
00:10:55,822 --> 00:11:01,119
but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas.

213
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:05,666
I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them.

214
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,585
It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?

215
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,921
It sounds kinda like peer pressure.

216
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,174
No, no, no. It's totally anthropological

217
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,426
and it's cool and I'm doing it.

218
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:20,681
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.

219
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,685
I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.

220
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:30,065
All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?

221
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:32,526
- Only when I'm drunk.
- Good boy.

222
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,698
And so, to fit in with the gorillas, Marshall had to learn to act like a gorilla,

223
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,992
and that meant gorilla lessons.

224
00:11:39,992 --> 00:11:42,911
Okay, I'm psyched about this.

225
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,789
But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.

226
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,333
Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.

227
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it.

228
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,840
Show it.

229
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,678
I'm psyched!

230
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,264
What was that?

231
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:11,273
Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure.

232
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:15,652
That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting

233
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:18,614
at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

234
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,658
Wow, that was really specific.

235
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,827
Show me you're psyched!

236
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,165
Let's do this!

237
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,084
- Ow! That hurt!
- So badly.

238
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,882
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.

239
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,675
Right. Get what done?

240
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:39,801
Whatever.

241
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:40,719
Cool.

242
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,137
And what guy is this?

243
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,722
There's always a guy.

244
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:47,518
Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.

245
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:50,646
You  sure? You want to practice your story one more time?

246
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,606
All right.

247
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:59,863
So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa,

248
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,909
and they're all, "Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs."

249
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,203
So I'm, like, "Snapadoo!"

250
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,831
So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport...

251
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,834
...and that is when the bouncer kicked us out.

252
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:18,257
Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring?

253
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,342
Worth every penny, bruh.

254
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,845
Eriksen...

255
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:27,182
...that was steak sauce!

256
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,271
Great story.

257
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,872
The next moning, I was about to buy my ticket to Germany when I got an e-mail.

258
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,415
Uh-oh.

259
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:53,750
"Hey, Ted, sorry I missed your call last night.

260
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,128
This long-distance thing sucks, huh?

261
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:59,173
Listen, I've been thinking and I really need to talk to you tonight.

262
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,175
I'll call you at 11:00. Victoria."

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,676
So?

264
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,012
So she's going to dump me.

265
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,805
Has anyone ever said, "Listen, I've been thinking,"

266
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,390
and then follow it up with something good?

267
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,895
It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie.

268
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:14,855
What else can it be?

269
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,066
What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?

270
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,860
I cut off all my fingers?

271
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:25,741
Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it.

272
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,495
I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident.

273
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:33,707
I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.

274
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,502
Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy.

275
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:38,295
So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?

276
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,588
I'd wait.

277
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,801
'Sup, Blauman? E-bomb here.

278
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,678
We still on for karaoke?

279
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:52,059
Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy.

280
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,312
Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.

281
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:56,939
Okay...

282
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,609
...what do you think?

283
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,486
Steak sauce.

284
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,863
Steak sauce?

285
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,281
Yeah.

286
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:11,119
Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business,

287
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:14,373
but please don't act like that around here.

288
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:16,959
Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...

289
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,922
No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas,

290
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:27,386
she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces.

291
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:31,056
I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.

292
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:31,974
Why?

293
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:36,144
Because  you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.

294
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:39,106
Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes,

295
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:43,110
but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that.

296
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:49,658
Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?

297
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,285
Okay.

298
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:55,289
But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there?

299
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,877
Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair.

300
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:01,879
What do you do? Go.

301
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,424
Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week.

302
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:06,884
Yeah.

303
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,845
You're right. They're delightful.

304
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,472
So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?

305
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,892
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.

306
00:16:14,892 --> 00:16:17,352
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.

307
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,064
Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really.

308
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:25,903
But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.

309
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,988
Oh,  baby, they have our song.

310
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,199
Let's do "Don't Go Breaking My Heart."

311
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,408
What?

312
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,244
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart." Elton John, Kiki Dee.

313
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,289
No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.

314
00:16:37,289 --> 00:16:40,042
Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.

315
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,753
"Iron Man." I could do "Iron Man."

316
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,795
Steak sauce.

317
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,380
Steak sauce, dude.

318
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,716
Should we tell him?

319
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,469
All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news.

320
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:54,431
On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR.

321
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,435
When you graduate, we want you working with us.

322
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,895
What do you say?

323
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,152
- Yes!
- That's my man!

324
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,445
I told you he would.

325
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,865
Aw, we're gonna own the office.

326
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:18,330
Okay, that was gross.

327
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,917
When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?

328
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,462
Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment.

329
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:28,841
I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years.

330
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:32,970
We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools.

331
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,180
You could quit your job and focus on your painting.

332
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,391
I know that you say you don't need it, but...

333
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,853
I love you and I want to give it to you anyway.

334
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:42,938
I want to give you the package.

335
00:17:42,938 --> 00:17:47,150
The package?! You've already given me the package.

336
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,029
You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.

337
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:57,119
Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.

338
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,455
Your package has always been big enough.

339
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,792
You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen,

340
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,712
but you've got a huge package.

341
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:13,844
Yeah.

342
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,600
Hello.

343
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,684
Why hasn't she called yet?

344
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,478
Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night.

345
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,605
Go out and do something.

346
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,609
No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now.

347
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,320
Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.

348
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,864
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.

349
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,159
She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.

350
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,368
Thanks.

351
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:41,079
Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go.

352
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,289
Break a leg.

353
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:47,753
And so I was sitting at home, waiting for the phone to ring, something occurred to me.

354
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:52,132
I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.

355
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:57,387
He's giving you the blues

356
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,517
You want to graduate, but not in his bed

357
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,228
Here's what you got to do

358
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:06,605
Pick up the phone...

359
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,731
Marshall.

360
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,816
Hey, hey.

361
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:11,777
Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.

362
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:12,778
Yeah.

363
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,488
Yeah.

364
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,906
How you doing?

365
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,034
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.

366
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,245
Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.

367
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:26,542
Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like.

368
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,670
The more I try to picture her, the more I can't.

369
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,296
Like, I remember how she makes me feel.

370
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:34,675
I just... I don't completely remember her.

371
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:37,594
It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.

372
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,013
Preserving something that's already gone.

373
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,057
Sounds like environmental law.

374
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,351
I don't know.

375
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,271
We struggle so hard to hold onto these things

376
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,648
that we know are going to disappear eventually.

377
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:51,400
And that's really noble,

378
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:55,112
but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot,

379
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:58,949
well, then where are you going to park your car?

380
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,458
Done dirt cheap!

381
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,169
Dirty deeds

382
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:11,879
Done dirt cheap!

383
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,797
Dirty deeds

384
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:15,507
Done dirt cheap!

385
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:19,219
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap, ow

386
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,848
Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap...

387
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,226
Uh, rockupied. Dude, what...?

388
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:34,443
Next up, Marshmallow and Lillypad.

389
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,917
Don't go breakin' my heart

390
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,462
I couldn't if I tried

391
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:58,258
Honey, if I get restless

392
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,761
Baby, you're not that kind...

393
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,639
It turns out some things are worth preserving.

394
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,265
But here's the real question:

395
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,352
It's 2:00 a.m. Your friends are still out singing karaoke,

396
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,648
but you're home early 'cause you're expecting a call from your girlfriend in Germany,

397
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:15,192
who was supposed to call four hours ago.

398
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,819
And then the phone rings.

399
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,115
Hello.

400
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,368
Hi, Ted. It's Robin.

401
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:28,080
Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh,

402
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,332
do you want to come over?

403
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,252
What do you do? Go.
