00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,423
Kids, something you might not know about your Uncle Marshall

3
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,550
is that he's always been good at games.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,093
I mean, unbeatable.

5
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:11,094
Gin!

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:14,723
Yahtzee!

7
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,725
Poker!

8
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,020
You don't have to shout out "poker" when you win.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,980
I know. It's just fun to say.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:25,275
We all finally agreed Marshall should be running our game nights

11
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,818
instead of playing in them.

12
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,988
Which he took to mean, "invent your own game."

13
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:33,033
It's called "Marsh-gammon."

14
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,577
It combines all the best features of all the best games--

15
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,996
Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.

16
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,248
Backgammon, obviously.

17
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,333
No. Backgammon sucks.

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,877
I took the only good part of backgammon, the "gammon,"

19
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,839
and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,259
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.

21
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,927
I'm going to go get another round.

22
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,513
Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight.

23
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,599
Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot,

24
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,601
so don't say anything embarrass...

25
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,019
Don't say anything.

26
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:06,775
And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin,

27
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:11,363
- so we you could just avoid the...
- Well, well, well. How rich.

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,867
You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend,

29
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:17,911
yet, you have been lying to her since day one.

30
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,246
Excuse me.

31
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,792
Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on.

32
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:26,003
So, nothing for him to stand on?

33
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:27,379
Okay, and thanks so much.

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:33,093
Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin?

35
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:37,598
I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,350
No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,521
Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?

38
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,190
Nothing. It's nothing.

39
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,985
And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?

40
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,613
Us? What would we do?

41
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:56,074
Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have

42
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,243
and, in fact, moved here to get away from.

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:03,248
However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?

44
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:04,917
- Fine.
- Fine.

45
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:06,001
Thank you.

46
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,003
I should go help Robin.

47
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,174
- Hey.
- Hey.

48
00:02:12,508 --> 00:02:15,969
So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?

49
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,180
Oh, sure. She's great.

50
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,225
Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted?

51
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,935
No. Victoria's great.

52
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,938
She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,482
I said, "She's great" too many times, didn't I?

54
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,359
You must really hate the bitch.

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,948
But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest,

56
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:39,159
then you "Marshall out," and all your chips go into the pot,

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,206
and remember, if you ever ask the question "What?", then...

58
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,917
you got to drink. Got it?

59
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,713
Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up.

60
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,632
Newbie goes first. Roll.

61
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:54,758
Okay.

62
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:56,635
Three!

63
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,012
You got Autobiography.

64
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,431
Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question

65
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,434
about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.

66
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,435
Marshall, come on.

67
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,188
Hey, she's the one who rolled a three.

68
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:14,820
Victoria, "Have you ever cheated while in a relationship?"

69
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,613
Wow, good question.

70
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,407
- You don't have to answer that.
- It's okay.

71
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:23,745
Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college,

72
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,457
and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night,

73
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:32,004
and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.

74
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,675
Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer.

75
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,760
You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.

76
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,266
So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?

77
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,184
What?

78
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,852
You said what, you got to drink!

79
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:52,649
Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd,

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,443
and the host said she knew you.

81
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,778
What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?

82
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,071
Shannon?!

83
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,157
Shannon, Shannon...

84
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:03,285
No, don't remember any Shannon.

85
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,954
Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...

86
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,289
Where's the tape?

87
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,627
Fine. I'll go get it.

88
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,962
Cool, okay. You know, whenever.

89
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,174
Okay, Robin, your roll.

90
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:22,679
Five! Another Autobiography...

91
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,265
for the player to your left, which...

92
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,850
Victoria!

93
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,519
Of course.

94
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,775
Victoria,  "How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?"

95
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,652
Wait, the card actually says "Ted?"

96
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:40,614
Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.

97
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,907
Prude alert.

98
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,911
Well... that's serious boyfriends.

99
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,621
I've dated other guys in between.

100
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,957
Oh, slut alert!

101
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,754
Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach.

102
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,682
Oh, wow, look at that.

103
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,643
Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.

104
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,855
Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.

105
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,191
Barney, what was on that tape?

106
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,568
Too bad you'll never find out.

107
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,819
Oh, damn it!

108
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:23,365
If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse.

109
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,659
Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.

110
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,451
What?!

111
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,369
Drink!

112
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:33,041
Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead.

113
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,459
So, should we pop it in?

114
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,295
- Give it to me, give it, give me...
- Play the tape, play it, play it!

115
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,672
- Ted!
- Fine, fine.

116
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,216
You cannot play it.

117
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:45,929
Shannon!

118
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,681
I  love you!

119
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,475
I love you so much.

120
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,189
What about us changing the world together?

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,691
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

122
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,610
I know I haven't.

123
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:08,327
Will I ever see another rainbow?

124
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:14,875
Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe?

125
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,877
Baby, please

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,172
Don't go

127
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,676
There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love

128
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,803
There's a thief in the palace and she's...

129
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,356
Did you try his cell phone?

130
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,774
Yeah, I left two messages.

131
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:41,026
I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard.

132
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,611
He's off the grid.

133
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,447
Hey, guys, what up?

134
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:46,782
Barney, where have you been?

135
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,742
Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.

136
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,911
Yeah, so sorry.

137
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:53,956
But seriously, what was up with the tape?

138
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:55,374
- No, no, stay.
- Come on, Barney.

139
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,542
- Come on.
- Stay!

140
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,709
I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it.

141
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,255
It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.

142
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,298
Well, we all have embarrassing stories.

143
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,050
Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.

144
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,260
Oh, really?

145
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,513
Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall?

146
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,723
Show me how good it is.

147
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,143
All right.

148
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,772
I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi,

149
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,732
but they were all at recess.

150
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,902
I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom.

151
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,659
It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down.

152
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,706
What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom.

153
00:07:39,835 --> 00:07:41,837
I wish I'd pulled up my pants.

154
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,679
The kids still call him Funny Butt.

155
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:55,851
Okay. I'll tell you my story.

156
00:07:56,143 --> 00:08:00,731
Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.

157
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,816
It  was 1998.

158
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,820
I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend.

159
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,364
My girlfriend... Shannon.

160
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,743
Yeah, you were meant for me

161
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,205
And I was meant for you

162
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,874
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

163
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,834
Thank you.

164
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:25,797
All right.

165
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,799
I love your singing, Barney.

166
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,010
And I love you, Shannon.

167
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:34,014
Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.

168
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,060
I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.

169
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,771
Hey, nonfat latte to go.

170
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,982
Mellow order, bro, mellow order.

171
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,985
Dude, that your g-friend?

172
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,654
All right, high five!

173
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,365
Sorry, I only give high twos.

174
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:54,618
Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.

175
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,745
Listen to you.

176
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,871
That?

177
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,458
You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings.

178
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,628
And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married.

179
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:06,630
You can read about it in my zine.

180
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,882
Hey, haircut, right here.

181
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,093
Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes.

182
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,386
Forget that touchy-feely crap.

183
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:15,055
You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.

184
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,057
I feel sorry for you, man.

185
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,101
Peace out, hombre.

186
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,646
Suits.

187
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,651
Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps.

188
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,403
Only problem was...

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,030
she never showed up.

190
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,370
She never showed?

191
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,372
So, what happened next?

192
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,292
You know what? This was a mistake.

193
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:47,379
Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?

194
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,339
Oh, I know just how to decide who.

195
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:51,800
You brought the game to the bar?

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,802
Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.

197
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,137
I was winning?

198
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,186
Fine. I'll go next.

199
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:05,772
I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.

200
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,192
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!

201
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:09,693
Yeah, we all know that one.

202
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,361
Okay, how about this?

203
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,031
I will tell you my most humiliating story.

204
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,366
Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!

205
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,369
Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare,

206
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:22,456
a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping,

207
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,709
and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.

208
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,712
Kids, I tell you a lot of inappropriate stories,

209
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,173
but there's no way in hell I'm telling you this one.

210
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,217
Don't worry, though, it wasn't that great.

211
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:37,638
That is the greatest story ever!

212
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,766
- Oh my God!
- Wow, wow!

213
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:45,187
Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy.

214
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:49,650
My saga... continues.

215
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,195
I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.

216
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,154
Barney.

217
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,864
Sugar Bear, where were you?

218
00:10:55,864 --> 00:11:00,118
Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.

219
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,704
But the Nicaraguans need us!

220
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:05,833
It's just, he's still supporting me, and...

221
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,710
Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but

222
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,921
I think you should go on without me.

223
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:11,922
Shannon, there is no...

224
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,842
Barney, it's your dream.

225
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,969
It's only two years.

226
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:19,012
I know we can make it.

227
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,561
As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult.

228
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:28,021
Her father couldn't control her life.

229
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,607
I had to go back and confront him.

230
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,781
She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.

231
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,707
What?!

232
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,711
Now we all got to drink.

233
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,304
Oh, my God. What happened next?

234
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,806
I don't know, guys.

235
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,391
Okay, okay.

236
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,227
- Marshall's mom sent us cookies...
- Lily, no!

237
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,521
For the team, Marshall, for the team.

238
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,858
Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily.

239
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,445
Thank you so much for the delicious cookies.

240
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,654
Mayonnaise.

241
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,906
Really?

242
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,741
Never would have guessed.

243
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:24,036
Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you.

244
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,829
Okay. Take care.

245
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,416
Oh,  crap. My mom sent cookies?

246
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,834
Yeah.

247
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,254
I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.

248
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:37,674
So we've got the whole place to ourselves.

249
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,219
I'm thinking floor sex.

250
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,803
Sounds reasonable.

251
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:45,474
Ooh, floor's cold.

252
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,060
Grab that afghan your mom made.

253
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,397
The whole time?

254
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,026
The... whole... time.

255
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,321
Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us.

256
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:01,657
We just earned a huge chunk of story.

257
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,574
Right.

258
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:04,117
So where was I?

259
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,663
Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.

260
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:18,507
How can... With your dad?

261
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,011
I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!

262
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,222
Barney, that's not my dad.

263
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,599
His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks.

264
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:31,353
I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.

265
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,564
We're breaking up?

266
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,274
But what about the Peace Corps?

267
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:39,111
Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase.

268
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:40,863
Greg's older.

269
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:42,447
He's successful.

270
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,200
He buys me all this cool stuff.

271
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,703
But I love you.

272
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,830
But he has a boat.

273
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:55,878
You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.

274
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:00,549
I didn't go.

275
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,803
That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon.

276
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:07,514
I didn't see her until a week later.

277
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,892
There's sugar in the basket.

278
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,022
Shannon! Shannon, you came back!

279
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,149
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.

280
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:21,945
Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?

281
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,864
Oh, she got the tape.

282
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:25,741
You?

283
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,577
It was you?

284
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:32,456
Will I ever see another rainbow

285
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,583
Oh, man.

286
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,829
Oh, you poor thing.

287
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:55,330
The story's not over.

288
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,499
I did see Shannon one more time.

289
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:58,458
When?

290
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,209
Sorry.

291
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,460
Sorry.

292
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:04,006
You've got to tell us.

293
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:09,219
I  don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.

294
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:11,972
Fine.

295
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:16,310
Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college

296
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:19,062
and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...

297
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,608
Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear.

298
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,527
Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth.

299
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:26,945
Why can't you?

300
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,364
You're right.

301
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:32,951
Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet,

302
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,623
but a while back, I was kind of into Robin.

303
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:42,836
In fact, on our first date, I might have said, "I love you."

304
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,673
Understandably, she freaked out and I left.

305
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,011
But unfortunately, the night did not end there.

306
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:55,933
We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.

307
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,851
To one hell of a night!

308
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:03,941
And I drank... a lot.

309
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:09,196
So  you guys think I should have kissed her?

310
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:14,952
Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.

311
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,995
Yes! Do it!

312
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,497
To the cab.

313
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,641
Hello?

314
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:39,017
Is someone out there?

315
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,113
You ralphed and ran?

316
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,449
I thought you were vomit-free since '93.

317
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,076
So that was a lie?

318
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,538
You re-returned for me.

319
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,498
That's really sweet.

320
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,210
Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.

321
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,170
Sorry.

322
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,421
It's okay.

323
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,048
Victoria, I know this must be...

324
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,510
Yeah. It kind of is.

325
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,683
Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story.

326
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:23,687
But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine.

327
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:26,440
We fast-forward eight years into the future.

328
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,693
Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.

329
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:33,447
Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.

330
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,249
Hi.

331
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,002
Barney?

332
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,378
Hi, Shannon.

333
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,131
- What are you doing here?
- Just listen.

334
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:55,010
When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me.

335
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,513
Now I'm this.

336
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:02,643
I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life.

337
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,187
And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now.

338
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:08,148
So here I am.

339
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,610
And then she told me about her life.

340
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,072
She and Greg dated for a while and then split up.

341
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:16,865
But here's the real kicker:

342
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,659
Shannon's a mom.

343
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:21,078
She has a little kid named Max.

344
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,871
That's crazy.

345
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,332
That could have been my kid.

346
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,252
But instead, what do I have?

347
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,880
My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet

348
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,425
and a string of one-night stands.

349
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:37,761
Hey. Come on.

350
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:41,473
I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another,

351
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:44,142
it doesn't make your life any worse.

352
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,688
My life rocks!

353
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:52,442
Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy!

354
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:57,531
I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers.

355
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,577
But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365!

356
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,453
You let me dodge a bullet, Big Guy.

357
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,875
Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry

358
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,836
on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life.

359
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,964
After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.

360
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:15,841
- Nope.
- Yeah.

361
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:16,675
- Nope.
- Yeah.

362
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,428
Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up.

363
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,555
You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had

364
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,474
a profound moment of doubt about yourself and...

365
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,060
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Barney!

366
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,438
Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?

367
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:30,731
Is your phone on?

368
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:33,150
Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.

369
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,028
Ew, gross. Just stop it.

370
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,824
Ladies, gentlemen... Ted.

371
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:43,744
This has been a wonderful evening.

372
00:20:43,744 --> 00:20:45,454
I got great dirt on all you guys.

373
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:47,581
I got Ted to tell the re-return.

374
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:49,500
I finally nailed Shannon!

375
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,044
Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right.

376
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:56,215
And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is.

377
00:20:56,215 --> 00:20:57,966
Peace out, hombres!

378
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,431
I think Barney just won game night.

379
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:09,895
We spend so much effort trying to keep parts of our lives hidden,

380
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:11,980
even from our closest friends.

381
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,566
But those rare times when we do open up,

382
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,195
it's amazing how minor those secrets all end up seeming.

383
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:30,207
Of course, not every secret was told that night.

384
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,752
But that's getting ahead of the story.
