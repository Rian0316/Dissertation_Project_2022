What if I judged you
for some of your jobs?

178
00:08:42,864 --> 00:08:45,565
Uh, bar-back slash captain
of a shrimp boat

179
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:49,202
In the Gulf of Mexico
isn't the bomb?

180
00:08:49,204 --> 00:08:51,637
What about when you worked
at the Gap?

181
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:54,907
Who told you about the Gap?

182
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,611
You, that time you were drunk,
folding a sweater,

183
00:08:58,613 --> 00:09:00,313
And you tried to help me
"spring into summer"

184
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:03,049
With cargo shorts.

185
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:07,686
Fine! I fell into the Gap.
I needed the money.

186
00:09:07,688 --> 00:09:10,089
Maybe sebastian needs
the money, too.

187
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,424
Who?

188
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,160
[knock at door]

189
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:16,395
And if you ever tell anyone
about the Gap,

190
00:09:16,397 --> 00:09:18,831
You will have a gap
between your neck

191
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,066
And where your head used to be.

192
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,969
"Oh, no you didn't."

193
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,975
Hey, I wasn't sure
if it was too late to come by

194
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:34,813
But the Ouija board said,
"Go ahead, the girls are up!"

195
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:37,683
You use that?

196
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:40,119
The only spirit I listen
to is Two-Buck Chuck,

197
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,355
And he mostly tells me
to take my top off.

198
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:46,125
Yeah, Ouija helps me make
all my big decisions.

199
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:51,630
Like coming to America,
adopting a Chinese orphan,

200
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,234
And leaving a Chinese orphan
at the fire station.

201
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,503
Those boards are creepy.

202
00:09:58,505 --> 00:09:59,838
You never know what you're
inviting in.

203
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,307
I mean, what if we open
a Hellmouth?

204
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,810
Aw, come on, girls, look around.

205
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,145
I mean, you already have.

206
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:12,384
Okay, now shh.
Okay...

207
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:14,720
Ouija,

208
00:10:14,722 --> 00:10:17,989
should I take Oleg back?

209
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,163
Yes?

210
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,765
Oh, now, see, that is creepy

211
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:31,703
Because I was shoving
it to "no".

212
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,905
Do you want to get back
with him?

213
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:35,840
Well, I'm torn.

214
00:10:35,842 --> 00:10:38,043
And also,
I don't know what to do.

215
00:10:39,412 --> 00:10:42,781
[dance music plays]

216
00:10:42,783 --> 00:10:46,651
Throw your hands in the air
like you just don't kale.

217
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,655
Max, I'm proud of you
for overlooking his job

218
00:10:50,657 --> 00:10:52,757
And giving this guy a chance.

219
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,694
He's making a DJ face.
I'm out.

220
00:10:58,063 --> 00:11:00,865
Oh, my God, Dylan.

221
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:02,767
No, we can't leave now.

222
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:05,069
I just saw this girl,
and she is the last person

223
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:06,237
I want to see.

224
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:07,505
What is the problem?

225
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:08,907
It's Hilary Waldare.

226
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:09,907
We went to Wharton together.

227
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,309
So competitive with me.

228
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:13,311
Loved it when I lost
all my money.

229
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:14,612
She even threw a party
to celebrate

230
00:11:14,614 --> 00:11:17,815
And then had the nerve
to invite me.

231
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:20,118
Worst party ever, by the way.

232
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,387
Uh, worse than being
at a dance club

233
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,490
That has a price club?

234
00:11:25,492 --> 00:11:28,993
Max Black in the house of grain.

235
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,997
And now he saw me.

236
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:35,233
Well, I'm gonna go hide
before she sees me.

237
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:38,336
I'll be in Tom's Shoes.
Nobody's ever over there.

238
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,276
I'm bustin' out some free range
electronic dance music.

239
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,410
That's right!

240
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,346
I'm bringing it in my own bag.

241
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:52,750
Uh, okay, we good?

242
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,151
See you next Tuesday.

243
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:56,287
Come on, stay.
What's your hurry?

244
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:59,657
I can't watch any more people
dance-shop.

245
00:11:59,659 --> 00:12:00,858
Max, come on.
Get in front of me.

246
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,426
See what you can do.

247
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:06,030
Oh, you're behind me this time.
That's new.

248
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:07,765
All right, everybody,

249
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:10,834
Frisee, 'cause we got
a special guest DJ

250
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:12,203
in the hizzay!

251
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,305
Who's so hot it's radicchio.

252
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,642
Go on.

253
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:20,844
Bob, I'd like to bid $1.00.

254
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:23,347
$1.00, Bob, $1.00.

255
00:12:23,349 --> 00:12:25,916
Have your pets
spayed or neutered.

256
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:29,486
Speaking of neutered pets,
here comes Han.

257
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:32,456
Still counts as a DJ shout-out.

258
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,525
Hey, why wait till Tuesday?

259
00:12:34,527 --> 00:12:37,227
Why don't I take a break
and we can go in the back.

260
00:12:37,229 --> 00:12:39,396
I just need to find someone
to cover me.

261
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:42,499
Someone bogarted
all the nut butter.

262
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:46,503
How about half of someone?

263
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,638
Can I help you, miss?

264
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,039
Max?

265
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,841
What are you doing?

266
00:13:04,843 --> 00:13:07,777
I'm thirsty, broke, and they
cut me off at the free lemonade.

267
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:09,145
What are you doing?

268
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,714
Well, two dudes
were getting it on

269
00:13:10,716 --> 00:13:13,450
In the family restroom, so...

270
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:15,085
Where's Sebastian?

271
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,052
Who?

272
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:18,121
Oh, milk.
Bottom shelf.

273
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,293
What's up?

274
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:29,065
You're not doing it
in the dairy case!

275
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,635
Uh, no I'm not,
'cause you won't go away.

276
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:35,338
Do you have to ruin sex
everywhere?

277
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,974
Well, Max,
if I wasn't lactose intolerant

278
00:13:37,976 --> 00:13:40,910
Before, I am now.

279
00:13:42,313 --> 00:13:45,882
Oh, my God, Caroline Channing!

280
00:13:45,884 --> 00:13:48,318
Hi!
It's Hilary Waldare.

281
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,354
- Oh, my God! Hi!
- Hi!

282
00:13:51,356 --> 00:13:53,923
I haven't seen you
since your party.

283
00:13:53,925 --> 00:13:57,393
Someone said you left crying.
How are you?

284
00:13:57,395 --> 00:14:00,496
I'm great! I mean,
I'm shopping at Whole Foods,

285
00:14:00,498 --> 00:14:03,800
Buying some organic fuel
that I'll probably take

286
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,937
A couple sips of in spin class
and then throw away, so...

287
00:14:07,939 --> 00:14:10,339
Oh, good, 'cause I heard
you were still poor

288
00:14:10,341 --> 00:14:13,142
And that you were working
as a waitress.

289
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,344
A waitress?

290
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:17,413
That is insane.

291
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:22,752
That is so insane it should be
in an ice tub in an asylum.

292
00:14:22,754 --> 00:14:25,588
I'm so glad you're great,
because when I saw you

293
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,426
In those three-year-old
Louboutins, I got worried.

294
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:32,995
Also, you have
an orange juice mustache.

295
00:14:40,003 --> 00:14:41,270
Oh. Where's Max?

296
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:42,905
Milk.

297
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,408
- Max, listen...
- Busy!

298
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,244
Hilary's still here.

299
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,679
And she called me a waitress.
How dare her.

300
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,915
She humiliated me,
and I didn't even get

301
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:56,352
A party this time.
I'm going home.

302
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,288
(store manager) Hilary Waldare,
report to register three.

303
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,423
Oh, my God!
Did he just say...

304
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:03,826
(store manager)
Hilary Waldare. Register three.

305
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:05,794
He did!
Oh, my God! Max!

306
00:15:05,796 --> 00:15:07,363
Busy!

307
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:10,833
What?
Do you wanna just join us?

308
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:14,837
Hilary Waldare works here,
as a cashier!

309
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,271
So I win!

310
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:18,607
Everyone knows on the job
humiliation chain,

311
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:22,644
It goes:
Prostitute, hostess, waitress,

312
00:15:22,646 --> 00:15:26,515
cashier, Princess Jasmine in the
Disney Electric Light Parade.

313
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:28,050
What happened
to not looking down

314
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,552
On other people
with crappy jobs?

315
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,287
Oh, please, this is real.

316
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:35,424
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have got $14

317
00:15:35,426 --> 00:15:37,192
Burning a second hole
in my pocket,

318
00:15:37,194 --> 00:15:39,928
And I'm gonna spend it here
at register three.

319
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,932
[Sebastian moans]

320
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,600
Whoo!

321
00:15:45,602 --> 00:15:48,737
What, you couldn't wait for me?

322
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:01,616
This goes out to Kelly
in prepared foods.

323
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,351
The Kelly with the cystic acne,

324
00:16:03,353 --> 00:16:06,788
not the Kelly
with the bald spot.

325
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,991
Now, where my Adele-heads at?

326
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:15,630
I'm glad you have no line,
'cause I have an exclusive

327
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:16,965
Private yoga class to get to...

328
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,567
Oh, Hilary!

329
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,969
Yes, Caroline.

330
00:16:20,971 --> 00:16:23,037
I am a cashier.

331
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,739
I'm sorry, a what?

332
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,708
I'm a cashier.

333
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:29,577
Yeah, turns out things
aren't great.

334
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:33,314
My husband left me for my dad.

335
00:16:33,316 --> 00:16:36,050
And they didn't even cut me
in on the lifetime movie rights.

336
00:16:36,052 --> 00:16:40,722
It's on in January.
Father is the bride.

337
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:42,890
Let me just weigh your salad.

338
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,827
Well, I'm sure you'll pull
yourself together like I did.

339
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:49,230
'cause I'm kind of killing it,
life-wise.

340
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:52,767
That'll be $28.

341
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:55,036
There's only $14 here.

342
00:16:55,038 --> 00:16:58,539
$28 for a salad?

343
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,108
Well, that's dinosaur kale.

344
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,743
Oh! Mistake.

345
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,478
Didn't want the Dinosaur kale.

346
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,380
Never liked dinosaurs
and really don't like them

347
00:17:06,382 --> 00:17:08,015
in my kale.

348
00:17:08,017 --> 00:17:10,017
Dinosaur kale gone.

349
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,054
You're just putting it
on the counter?

350
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,857
Oh, I don't usually shop
for myself.

351
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,060
Is that not how it's done?

352
00:17:20,062 --> 00:17:24,031
Caroline, do you not have
enough money?

353
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:29,537
No, Hilary, I have enough money.

354
00:17:29,539 --> 00:17:33,674
I just don't know why
I have so many eggs.

355
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,947
Here. You're holding up
the line.

356
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,382
You obviously don't have
enough money

357
00:17:41,384 --> 00:17:44,151
To pay for your salad.

358
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,786
Sad.

359
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:47,988
I don't know what
you're implying.

360
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,692
Oh! Here is my very successful
business partner.

361
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,795
Sorry it took so long.
I couldn't find my pants.

362
00:17:54,797 --> 00:17:58,432
I don't know how they made it
all the way to the loading dock.

363
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,601
Face it Caroline,
you came here to humiliate me

364
00:18:00,603 --> 00:18:02,402
And you can't even afford
that egg.

365
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,272
On your face.

366
00:18:05,274 --> 00:18:10,210
Miss, did you drop
this $20 bill?

367
00:18:10,212 --> 00:18:12,346
Yes! Yes I did!

368
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,615
I dropped some money, too.

369
00:18:14,617 --> 00:18:16,984
Don't push it.

370
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,285
Thank you, sir.
This is very kind of you

371
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:20,520
And I really appreciate it.

372
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:22,222
Anything for my favorite
waitress.

373
00:18:22,224 --> 00:18:23,523
[gasps]

374
00:18:23,525 --> 00:18:27,761
Oh, I knew you were a waitress.

375
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,497
Your store sucks!

376
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:33,300
I just had sex
in your dairy department.

377
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:36,269
Keep the change.

378
00:18:36,271 --> 00:18:38,772
And buy your dad-husband
a wedding gift.

379
00:18:46,948 --> 00:18:49,649
Okay, one more time.

380
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:52,652
Ouija, should I be with Oleg?

381
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,590
15 out of 15 yeses.

382
00:18:57,592 --> 00:19:00,627
That's still unclear.

383
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:02,028
Sophie, this is silly.

384
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,230
You know you two wanna
get back together.

385
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:08,067
Caroline, we already have
the Ouija board.

386
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,270
We don't need another thing
around here that's flat

387
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:14,340
And wrong all the time.

388
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:19,379
Fine. Sophie, if it's not me,
after all I've offered you, go.

389
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:24,017
Ask the spirits who the man
you are supposed to be with is.

390
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,788
Ouija, please spell out
the name of the man

391
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,358
That I'm supposed to be with.

392
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,428
Oh, look, it's moving.

393
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,000
"V", "A", "N",

394
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:44,504
This is what the world
was like before the internet.

395
00:19:44,506 --> 00:19:48,641
"K", "O".

396
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:50,142
"Vanko".

397
00:19:50,144 --> 00:19:52,778
Vanko?
Yeah, that sounds cute.

398
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,714
Yeah, I like it...
I'm sorry, Oleg.

399
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:56,616
The spirits have spoken.

400
00:19:56,618 --> 00:19:59,485
I'm supposed to be with someone
named Vanko.

401
00:19:59,487 --> 00:20:01,654
And they know the best.

402
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:04,323
So you're supposed to be with
someone named Vanko?

403
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:07,193
Mm-hmm.

404
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:18,471
"Vanko Oleg Golishevsky"?

405
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:23,209
I go by my middle name
'cause there were seven other

406
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:27,179
Vankos in my family.

407
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:31,050
But I didn't even know that.

408
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:34,553
Yeah, that means the Ouija is...

409
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:37,389
Oh, uh...

410
00:20:37,391 --> 00:20:40,626
Ohh... Yeah...

411
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:43,495
Oh, no, no, Vanko.
No!

412
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:45,430
I...
No, I...

413
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:48,100
We can... You and I can get back
together, okay?

414
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:51,169
But I just can't be here
right now.

415
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:53,639
No, I mean,
this is just too damn spooky!

416
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,872
[shrieks]

417
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:00,882
I can't wait to tell my brothers
Vanko and Vanko about this.

418
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:04,919
Uh, uh, uh.

419
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:07,300
Word on the street is,

420
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:10,656
you've been talking
some smack about cashiers.
