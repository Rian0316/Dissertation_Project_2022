1
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,432
Lizzy! Jane!


2
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:06,275
What do you think? Mr Collins has made
an offer of marriage to Charlotte Lucas!


3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,778
She's accepted him!


4
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,949
Charlotte?


5
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,660
Engaged to Mr Collins?


6
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,663
Impossible!


7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:24,126
The fireplace in the great room at
Rosings would be much larger than that.


8
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,172
A fireplace of truly
prodigious dimensions.


9
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,342
But why should you be surprised,
my dear Lizzy?


10
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,929
Do you think it incredible
that Mr Collins could procure


11
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:37,681
any woman's good opinion,


12
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,184
because he didn't succeed with you?


13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,936
Charlotte, I didn't mean...


14
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,150
I <i>was </i>surprised.


15
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,031
Charlotte, if Mr Collins has been so
fortunate as to secure your affections,


16
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,701
I'm delighted for you both.


17
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:00,370
I see what you are feeling.


18
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:05,042
I'm not romantic, you know.


19
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:10,130
I never was.
I ask only a comfortable home.


20
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:14,885
And, considering Mr Collins' character
and situation in life,


21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,137
I'm convinced my chance
of happiness with him


22
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,516
is as fair as most
who enter the marriage state.


23
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,851
(COLLINS): My dear Charlotte!


24
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:28,190
Cousin Elizabeth, you can see before you
the happiest of men!


25
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,488
Jane, it was such a
humiliating spectacle!


26
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,699
She knows she's marrying
one of the stupidest men in England.


27
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,285
I never believed her capable of that.


28
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,665
Lizzy, you do not make allowances
for differences of situation and temper.


29
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,752
Our cousin Mr Collins is not the
cleverest of men, perhaps,


30
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,629
but he is respectable.


31
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:56,134
He is not vicious, and as far as
fortune goes, it's an eligible match.


32
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:59,346
<i>Very </i>eligible! You wouldn't think of
marrying a man like that,


33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,181
simply to secure your own comfort.


34
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,434
No, but Lizzy, not everyone is the same.


35
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,569
Dear Jane!


36
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,072
I doubt that
you will have to make a choice


37
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,577
between marrying for love and marrying
for more material considerations.


38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,912
Though you may, perhaps?


39
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,456
(THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR)


40
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,837
This came just now
from Netherfield, ma'am.


41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,463
Thank you.


42
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,095
It's from Caroline Bingley.


43
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,975
She writes...


44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:49,229
..that the whole party will have left
Netherfield by now, for London.


45
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,150
And without any intention of
coming back again.


46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,574
(MISS BINGLEY): <i>Charles first thought
that his business in London</i>


47
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>would only take a few days,</i>


48
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,829
<i>but we 're certain
that this cannot be so.</i>


49
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,415
<i>I am convinced that when Charles
gets to town,


50
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>he will be in no hurry
to leave it again.</i>


51
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,045
<i>I do not pretend to regret</i>


52
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:16,256
<i>anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire,
my dearest friend,</i>


53
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,467
<i>except your society.</i>


54
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,720
<i>Mr Darcy, of course, is impatient
to see his sister.</i>


55
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,597
<i>And to confess the truth,</i>


56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,475
<i>I'm scarcely less eager
to meet her again,</i>


57
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:32,856
<i>from the hope I dare to entertain
of her being hereafter... my sister.</i>


58
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,359
<i>Am I wrong, my dearest Jane,</i>


59
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,027
<i>in indulging the hope of an event</i>


60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,197
<i>which would secure the happiness
of so many?


61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,991
Is it not clear enough ?


62
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,702
Caroline Bingley believes her brother
is indifferent to me, and


63
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,705
she means to put me on my guard.


64
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,458
Can there be any other opinion
on the subject?


65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,877
Yes, there can!


66
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:57,047
Miss Bingley sees that
her brother is in love with you, and


67
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,549
she wants him to marry Miss Darcy.


68
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,177
She hopes to keep him in town, and


69
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,013
persuade you that
he does not care about you.


70
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:09,935
Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.


71
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,147
No one who has seen you and Bingley
together can doubt his affection.


72
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,818
I cannot believe Caroline is capable of
wilful deceit.


73
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:21,029
All I can hope for is that
she is deceived herself.


74
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,740
Believe her to be deceived,
by all means,


75
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,909
but she can hardly convince a man
so much in love


76
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:28,537
that he's in love
with someone else instead!


77
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:35,836
If Bingley is not back by your side and
dining at Longbourn within two weeks,


78
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,296
I shall be very much surprised.


79
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,144
I don't envy Charlotte in the slightest!
F ancy marrying a clergyman!


80
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,855
He'Il read from Fordyce's sermons
every night.


81
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,982
Before they go to bed!


82
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,529
Look at that hideous cloth!
It would do very well for Mary.


83
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,658
Look! There's Denny and Carter.


84
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,536
And Wickham!


85
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,080
I suppose you'Il keep him
all to yourself again?


86
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,624
Of course.
She's violently in love with him!


87
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,878
For heaven's sake, lower your voice.


88
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,422
Good afternoon to you, Ladies!


89
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,926
How fortunate! We were
going to Longbourn in search of you.


90
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,387
We came into town in search of you!


91
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,865
We hoped we would see you
at the Netherfield ball.


92
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,744
I was very sorry to lose the pleasure
of dancing with you.


93
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,747
But fate, it would seem...


94
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,458
No. With you I must be entirely open.


95
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,378
I decided that it would be wrong
for me to be there.


96
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:03,840
I found that I had better not meet
with Mr Darcy.


97
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,635
Scenes might arise
unpleasant to more than myself.


98
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,095
I understand and admire
your forbearance.


99
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,265
Not that it would give me
a moment's concern


100
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,267
to see Mr Darcy publicly set down,


101
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,437
but in Mr Bingley's house...


102
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,607
It would grieve me
to see him embarrassed and discomfited.


103
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,318
And through him, your sister.


104
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,363
Yes.


105
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,659
I hear Mr Collins
is engaged to be married.


106
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,870
Yes, to my good friend Charlotte Lucas.


107
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:38,208
I had thought that his intentions
tended in another direction.


108
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:44,506
Perhaps they did, but they took a little
turn, to everybody's satisfaction.


109
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,049
And relief.


110
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,179
I hope that you will stay and
take tea with us.


111
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:54,558
I should like to introduce you
to my mother and father.


112
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,143
Thank you.


113
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,918
Denny!


114
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:42,188
Oh, young George Wickham is such a
charming young man, is he not, my dear ?


115
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,317
What? Oh, indeed he is.


116
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,111
It was very good of him
to entertain us so eloquently


117
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,864
with stories about his misfortunes.


118
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,784
With such narratives to hand,
who would read novels ?


119
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,788
But I believe he has been treated
contemptibly by Mr Darcy, father.


120
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:04,836
I dare say he has. Though Darcy may be
no more of a black-hearted villain


121
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,298
than your average rich man,
used to his own way.


122
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,885
It behoves us all
to take very careful thought


123
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,597
before pronouncing an adverse judgement
on any of our fellow men.


124
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,515
Lord!


125
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:20,477
I feel very sorry for poor Mr Wickham.


126
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,605
And so becoming in his regimentals!


127
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:28,735
I remember the time when I liked
a red coat myself well enough.


128
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,366
And I do still in my heart.


129
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,996
And there's no need to smile like that,
Miss Lizzy!


130
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,791
Though Mr Wickham
has taken a fancy to you,


131
00:09:42,874 --> 00:09:45,210
I'm sure you've done nothing
to deserve it,


132
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,879
after your dealings with Mr Collins!


133
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:51,257
Well, it is all in vain,
it will all come to nothing!


134
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,009
The poor young man!


135
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,054
If only he had five or
six thousand a year,


136
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,057
I' d be happy to see him marry
any of the girls!


137
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,519
But nothing turns out the way it should.


138
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:08,483
And now Mr Bingley, of whom we all had
such expectations, is gone off forever!


139
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,777
What?


140
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,531
I've heard again from Caroline Bingley.


141
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:18,868
It's now definite that they will stay
in town for the whole winter.


142
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,663
I cannot believe it.


143
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,832
It is true.


144
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,209
Come now, Jane, take comfort.


145
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:30,213
Next to being married, a girl likes
to be crossed in love now and then.


146
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:35,552
When is it your turn, Lizzy?
You can't be long outdone by Jane,


147
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,054
when here are officers enough in Meryton


148
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,557
to disappoint all the young ladies
in the country.


149
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,309
Let Wickham be your man.
He's a pleasant fellow.


150
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,020
He would jilt you creditably.


151
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,647
Thank you, sir,
but a less agreeable man would do.


152
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,483
We must not all expect
Jane's good fortune.


153
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,111
True, but it is a comfort to think...


154
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,156
that whatever of that kind
may befall you,


155
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,660
you have an affectionate mother
who will always make the most of it.


156
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,498
I don't know what will become of us all,
indeed I do not!


157
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,879
And I cannot bear to think of
Charlotte Lucas


158
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,881
being mistress of this house!


159
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:17,635
That I should be forced to make way
for her, and see her take my place!


160
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:23,433
My dear, don't give way to such gloomy
thoughts. Let us hope for better things.


161
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,562
Let us flatter ourselves
that I might outlive you.


162
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,077
You mustn't be anxious for me, Lizzy.


163
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,955
He will be forgot,


164
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,708
and we shall all be as we were before.


165
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,508
But, I may remember him as...


166
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,471
..the most amiable man
of my acquaintance.


167
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,390
That is all.


168
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,268
I have nothing either to hope or fear...


169
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,148
..and nothing to reproach him with.
At least I have not had that pain.


170
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:20,907
My dear Jane.


171
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,286
You're too good. Your sweetness and
disinterestedness are truly angelic.


172
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:29,415
- Don't tease me, Lizzy.
- Indeed I do <i>not</i> tease you.


173
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:36,714
There are few people whom I really love,
and even fewer of whom I think well.


174
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:40,802
The more I see of the world,
the more I am dissatisfied with it.


175
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,058
Jane, what if you were to go to town?


176
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,519
Aunt and Uncle Gardiner
would gladly take you


177
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,564
with them to Gracechurch Street
after Christmas.


178
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:55,191
Why would you have me
go to London, Lizzy?


179
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,277
No reason.


180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,155
A change of scene and society?


181
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,255
Why are you so late?


182
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,091
I'm sure I feared your coach
had overset itself,


183
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:22,635
or you had been attacked by robbers!


184
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,181
Nonsense, we made good time.
How do you do, F anny?


185
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:30,393
Very ill, Edward. No one knows
what I suffer with my nerves.


186
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,979
But then I never complain.


187
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,649
That's the best way, F anny.
You're very good.


188
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:41,321
- Have you brought us some presents?
- I see you've not changed, Lydia.


189
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,200
- Why, have I not grown?
- Aye, in everything but good sense.


190
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,493
Lizzy!


191
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,038
Get yourselves in, get yourselves in,


192
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,041
for you have barely time
for a change of clothes!


193
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,668
We are bidden to the Philips'
this evening.


194
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,339
I have no desire to be going
here and there at night.


195
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:03,509
I should much rather sit at home
and rest my poor nerves.


196
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:09,349
# God rest ye merry gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay,


197
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:15,063
# Remember Christ our Saviour
Was born on Christmas Day,


198
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:18,274
# To save us all from Satan's pow'r...


199
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:22,070
(SONG CONTINUES IN THE BACKGROUND)


200
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:36,459
Aye, poor Jane. I would not have you
think I blame poor Jane at all!


201
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,337
Who could blame poor Jane
for the matter ?


202
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,382
She is the dearest girl in the world!


203
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:46,344
I was telling our dear sister,
Mrs Gardiner, she did her best.


204
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,638
She would have got Bingley if she could.


205
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,350
She did her best,
and no one could do more.


206
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:57,105
But, oh, sister,
when I think about Lizzy!


207
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,733
- It must be very hard, sister.
- It <i>is </i>very hard.


208
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,653
She could have been
Mr Collins' wife by now!


209
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,738
That would have given you such comfort!


210
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:09,242
Oh, those Lucases are
such artful people indeed.


211
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,287
They are all for what they can get!


212
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,708
However, your coming just at this time
is the greatest of comforts.


213
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,126
And we are very pleased to hear


214
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,838
what you tell us about
the latest fashions for long sleeves.


215
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,890
May I present Mr Wickham to you, Aunt?


216
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,768
I understand you come from Derbyshire,
Mr Wickham.


217
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:38,730
Indeed I do, ma'am.
Do you know the country?


218
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,981
Very well.


219
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,943
I spent some of the
happiest years of my life at Lambton.


220
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,071
Not five miles from where I grew up,
at Pemberley!


221
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:51,367
Pemberley! Surely it is the most
handsome house in Derbyshire,


222
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,703
and consequently in the world!


223
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,414
I see you take my view of things, ma'am.


224
00:15:56,497 --> 00:16:00,585
- Are you acquainted with the family?
- No.


225
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,464
I had the good fortune
to be the protégé of old Mr Darcy.


226
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,468
He was the very best of men.
I wish you' d known him.


227
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,388
And a four on yours, and I'm out!
Lord, I've won again!


228
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,643
Let's have some dancing now.
I long for a dance!


229
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,438
Mary!


230
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,566
Mary, play Grimstock.


231
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,751
Capital! Capital!


232
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,342
- Fine girls, are they not, Mr Gardiner ?
- Indeed they are, Sir William.


233
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,762
- The two eldest in particular, perhaps ?
- Indeed, indeed.


234
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:56,349
They would grace
the court of St. James itself!


235
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,602
But let's not forget
the younger Miss Bennets!


236
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,022
Aye, they have arms and legs enough
between them,


237
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,441
and are three of the silliest girls
in England.


238
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,038
When do you go into Kent?


239
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,166
We shall spend the wedding night
at Lucas Lodge,


240
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,668
and then travel to Hunsford on Friday.


241
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:16,262
You will write to me, Lizzy?


242
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,098
I believe I am not likely to leave Kent
for some time.


243
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:22,310
I shall depend on hearing from you
very often.


244
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,145
That you certainly shall.


245
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:27,231
My father and Maria
are to come to me in March.


246
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,400
Lizzy, will you promise to be
one of the party?


247
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,445
Y ou will be as welcome
as either of them.


248
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,613
Then how could I refuse ?


249
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:37,492
But I'Il only come if you guarantee me
a glimpse of the famous chimney piece


250
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,327
at Rosings Park!


251
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,788
That you could scarcely avoid,
even if you wished to!


252
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,040
(MARIA): Charlotte!


253
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:49,378
Have you asked her ?
Is she to come to Hunsford with us ?


254
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,255
- Yes.
- Good!


255
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,382
I shan't be half so frightened
of Lady Catherine


256
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,551
if you are with us, Lizzy!


257
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,305
Who is that girl
dancing with Mr Wickham?


258
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,099
Her name is Mary King.


259
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:04,519
She's come to stay with her uncle
in Meryton.


260
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:10,483
- She's not very pretty, is she?
- Beauty is not the only virtue, Maria.


261
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,320
She's just inherited a fortune
of 10,000 pounds, I understand.


262
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,989
Now that is a definite virtue!


263
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:35,216
(MOTHER): It is very hard.
And I feel sorry for Lizzy,


264
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,385
because she's done little to deserve it.


265
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,346
(LYDIA): For Wickham to pursue Miss King
all the way to Barnet,


266
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,349
just for her 10,000 pounds!


267
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,561
(KITTY): I wish someone would die
and leave me 10,000 pounds.


268
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:49,021
(KITTY): Then all the officers
would love me!


269
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:53,192
(MOTHER): I'm sure they would,
Kitty dear.


270
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,819
(KITTY): Did you think
her pretty, mamma?


271
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,948
No indeed,
she has nothing to any of you.


272
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:04,245
(LYDIA): A little short freckled thing!
Poor Wickham. How he must be suffering.


273
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,666
(JANE): <i>January the 12th.</i>


274
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,543
<i>My dearest Lizzy,</i>


275
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,380
<i>here we continue at Gracechurch Street
to be quiet and comfortable.</i>


276
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,550
<i>Aunt and Uncle could not be kinder
or more attentive.</i>


277
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:22,221
<i>All I lack here, dear Lizzy, is you,
to make me laugh at myself.</i>


278
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,060
<i>Three weeks ago, when our Aunt
was going to that part of town,</i>


279
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>I took the opportunity of calling on
Miss Bingley in Grosvenor Street.</i>


280
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:39,488
<i>I was very eager to see Caroline again.
And I thought she was glad to see me,</i>


281
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,575
<i>though a little out of spirits.</i>


282
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,578
<i>She reproached me for giving her
no notice of my coming to London,</i>


283
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,038
<i>and I thought it very strange</i>


284
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:49,498
<i>that both my letters
should have gone astray.</i>


285
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,711
Very strange indeed.


286
00:20:55,755 --> 00:21:00,384
<i>My visit was not long, as Caroline
and Mrs Hurst were going out.</i>


287
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,552
Goodbye, Miss Bennet.


288
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:05,806
<i>They promised to call at
Gracechurch Street in a day or two.</i>


289
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:17,109
<i>I waited at home every morning
for three weeks,</i>


290
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,072
<i>and at length, today she came.</i>


291
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,370
<i>I know, my dear Lizzy,</i>


292
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:30,164
<i>you will be incapable
of triumphing at my expense,</i>


293
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,334
<i>when I confess I have been
entirely deceived</i>


294
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,711
<i>in Miss Bingley's regard for me.</i>


295
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:41,050
<i>She made it very evident
that she took no pleasure in seeing me.</i>


296
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,430
<i>When I asked after her brother,</i>


297
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>she made it clear
that he knows of my being in town,</i>


298
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,479
<i>but is much engaged at present
with Mr Darcy and his sister.</i>


299
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,863
<i>I must conclude then,</i>


300
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,616
<i>that Mr Bingley
now no longer cares for me.</i>


301
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,245
Lizzy! Come quick!
Denny and Carter are here.


302
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,956
And guess who else? Wickham!


303
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,919
I heard you were going into Kent.


304
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,881
I felt I could not let you go
without calling to see you once.


305
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:05,468
I'm very glad you did.
I've missed our conversations.


306
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,971
I hear I am to congratulate you


307
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,015
on your forthcoming betrothal
to Miss King?


308
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,603
You must despise me.


309
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,730
Indeed I do not!


310
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,232
I understand, as my younger sisters
are not yet able to,


311
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,401
that handsome young men must have
something to live on,


312
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:24,528
as well as the plain ones.


313
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,162
Miss Bennet...


314
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,375
..I would wish you to believe me that...
had circumstances been different...


315
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,962
Had old Mr Darcy never had a son.


316
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,423
Oh, yes.


317
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:48,803
But life is full of these trials,
as my sister Mary reminds us daily.


318
00:23:58,521 --> 00:24:02,274
I sincerely wish you
every happiness in the world.


319
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:07,279
- You are very forbearing.
- I flatter myself I am!


320
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,699
I think Jane would be quite proud of me.


321
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:15,621
I hope you and I, at least,
will always be good friends.


322
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,915
I'm sure we shall, Mr Wickham.


323
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,223
(FATHER): Well, Lizzy,
on pleasure bent again.


324
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:39,228
Never a thought of what your poor
parents will suffer in your absence?


325
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,440
It is a pleasure I could well forego,
father, as I think you know.


326
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:47,027
But I shall be happy to see Charlotte.


327
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:51,240
What of your cousin Mr Collins
and the famous Lady Catherine de Bourgh ?


328
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,492
As a connoisseur of human folly,


329
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:57,121
I thought you impatient
to be savouring these delights.


330
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:01,500
Of some delights, I believe, sir,
a little goes a long way.


331
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:05,337
Yes. Well, think of me, Lizzy.


332
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,673
Until you or your sister Jane return,


333
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,260
I shall not hear two words of sense
spoken together.


334
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,264
You'Il be very much missed, my dear.


335
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,689
Very well, very well. Go along then.
Get along with you.


336
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:40,789
Aye, Maria. All that land to the left
of us belongs to Rosings Park.


337
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:45,210
All of it? Oh, Lady Catherine must be
very rich indeed!


338
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:49,757
I believe so, I believe so!
And she has many favours in her gift.


339
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,218
Y our sister has made
a fortunate alliance!


340
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,639
(SIR WILLIAM): Yes, well,


341
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,850
I believe the next turn
takes us on to Hunsford.


342
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,751
Sir William! Maria!


343
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,963
Cousin Elizabeth.


344
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:34,635
I am truly honoured to be able
to welcome you to my humble abode!


345
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,348
- My dear Sir!
- My dear Mr Collins!


346
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:45,145
I am deeply honoured to make
a humble welcome to the Parsonage...


347
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,488
- I am happy to see you, Elizabeth.
- And I you.


348
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,659
The staircase, I flatter myself,


349
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,662
is eminently suitable
for a clergyman in my position,


350
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,623
being neither too shallow nor too steep.


351
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:08,919
As serviceable a staircase as I've ever
seen, sir. At St. James' Court...


352
00:27:09,003 --> 00:27:12,840
Though it is nothing to the staircases
you will see at Rosings.


353
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:16,301
I say staircases,
because there are several,


354
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,179
and each in its way very fine.


355
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,268
And here, if you would permit me,
cousin Elizabeth.


356
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:32,109
This will be your bedchamber,
while you are with us.


357
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,156
And I trust you will find it comfortable
and convenient.


358
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,368
- Indeed it is a very pleasant room.
- Observe that closet, cousin Elizabeth.


359
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:45,039
- What do you say to that?
- Well...


360
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,168
Is it not the very essence
of practicality and convenience?


361
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,795
Lady Catherine de Bourgh herself


362
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:56,467
was kind enough to suggest that
these shelves be fitted.


363
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,013
Shelves in the closet...
Happy thought indeed.


364
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,432
She is kindness itself.


365
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,686
Nothing is too small to be
beneath her notice, is it not, my dear ?


366
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,438
She is a very attentive neighbour.


367
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,150
We dine at Rosings Park
twice every week!


368
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:15,027
And are never allowed to walk home.


369
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,697
That is generosity itself,
is it not, Maria?


370
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:22,034
Her ladyship's carriage
is regularly ordered for us.


371
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,996
I should say one of her ladyship's
carriages, for she has several.


372
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:29,041
And now, Sir William,


373
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,711
you were kind enough
to express a wish to see my gardens.


374
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,388
Mr Collins tends the gardens himself,


375
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,517
and spends a good part of every day
in them.


376
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,395
- The exercise must be beneficial.
- Oh, yes.


377
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:54,024
I encourage him to be in his garden
as much as possible.


378
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,612
And he has to walk to Rosings
nearly every day.


379
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,990
So often? Is that necessary?


380
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:07,162
Perhaps not, but I confess
I encourage him in that as well.


381
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,669
- Walking is very beneficial exercise.
- Oh, indeed it is.


382
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,632
When he's in the house,
he is mostly in his book room,


383
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,300
which affords a good view of the road,


384
00:29:20,384 --> 00:29:23,679
whenever Lady Catherine's carriage
should drive by.


385
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:28,725
- And you prefer to sit in this parlour ?
- Y es.


386
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:32,729
So, it often happens
that a whole day passes


387
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:37,025
in which we haven't spent more than
a few minutes in each other's company.


388
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,610
I see.


389
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:42,281
I find that I can bear the solitude
very cheerfully.


390
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,741
I find myself...


391
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,995
..quite content
with my situation, Lizzy.


392
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,377
- (COLLINS): Charlotte, come quickly!
- (CHARLOTTE): What is it?


393
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:58,297
(MARIA): Lizzy! Lizzy!


394
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,300
Come into the dining room.


395
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,428
There's such a sight to be seen!
Make haste!


396
00:30:09,016 --> 00:30:11,059
Look, Lizzy, look!


397
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:15,647
Is this all? I expected
the pigs had got into the garden!


398
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:17,316
Here's only Lady Catherine and
her daughter.


399
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,943
No, that's old Mrs Jenkinson.


400
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:22,070
With her is Miss Anne de Bourgh!


401
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:25,199
She's rude to keep Charlotte
out in this wind!


402
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:29,077
- What a little creature she is!
- I like her appearance.


403
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,956
She looks sickly and cross.
Yes, she will do very well.


404
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,709
She'Il make him a proper wife.


405
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,461
Who, Lizzy?


406
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,518
(COLLINS): Mark the windows.


407
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:57,231
There are 64 in all. 64!


408
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,857
And I have it on good authority


409
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:03,528
that the glazing alone originally cost
in excess of 600 pounds!


410
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:07,282
It's a very handsome building,
and prettily situated, sir.


411
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,078
And by no means lacking in windows.


412
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,873
Do not make yourself uneasy,
my dear cousin, about your apparel.


413
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:19,044
Lady Catherine is far from requiring
that elegance of dress,


414
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,171
which becomes herself and her daughter.


415
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:24,633
She won't think the worse of you
for being simply dressed.


416
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,552
She likes to preserve
the distinction of rank.


417
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,014
Thank you, Mr Collins,
that is a great comfort.


418
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,476
(LADY CATHERINE): An apothecary
will serve your needs quite adequately.


419
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:38,063
Make sure it be no one but Nicholson,
Mrs Collins.


420
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:42,025
I shall be extremely angry
if I hear you have gone elsewhere.


421
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,486
I have no intention to, Lady Catherine.


422
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,114
No indeed. No intention at all.


423
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,782
Well.


424
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,294
Your friend appears to be
quite a genteel


425
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,671
pretty sort of girl, Mrs Collins.


426
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:08,093
Her father's estate is entailed
on Mr Collins, I understand.


427
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,262
Yes, ma'am, and I am, believe me...


428
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,598
Do you have brothers and sisters,
Miss Bennet?


429
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,601
Y es, ma'am,
I am the second of five sisters.


430
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,396
Are any of your younger sisters out?


431
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:22,524
- Y es, ma'am, all of them.
- All?


432
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,447
What? All five out at once ?


433
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,910
The younger ones out
before the older are married?


434
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:39,624
Your youngest sisters
must be very young?


435
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,170
Yes, ma'am, my youngest is not sixteen.


436
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,049
Well!


437
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:52,220
She is full young
to be out much in company.


438
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:56,683
But really, ma'am, I think it would be
hard upon younger sisters,


439
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:59,770
that they not have their share
of society and amusement,


440
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,606
simply because their elder sisters
have not the means or


441
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,733
inclination to marry early.


442
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,903
Sir William, wouldn't you agree?


443
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:12,324
- Well...
- (LADY CATHERINE): Upon my word!


444
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:17,371
You give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person!


445
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,248
Pray, what is your age?


446
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,250
With three younger sisters grown up,


447
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,003
your ladyship can hardly expect me
to own it.


448
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:29,091
Miss Bennet, you cannot be
more than twenty, I am sure.


449
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:32,844
Therefore there is no need
to conceal your age!


450
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,013
I am not one and twenty.


451
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:45,690
Mrs Collins, did I tell you of
Lady Metcalf's calling on me yesterday


452
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:49,778
to thank me for sending her Miss Pope?
''Lady Catherine, '' said she,


453
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,907
''you have given me a treasure. '' Yes!


454
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,497
Yes.


455
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,671
It is beautiful.


456
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,883
I could grow almost as fond
of these woods and hills as you have.


457
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:14,094
Lizzy?


458
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,054
We have been here three weeks,


459
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:19,683
and already we have dined
at Rosings Park six times!


460
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,060
I would never have expected it
to be so many!


461
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,895
No, nor I.


462
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,939
(COLLINS): My dear!


463
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,359
Maria! Cousin Elizabeth !


464
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:33,405
Mr Darcy is arrived at Rosings!


465
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,283
And with him his cousin,
Colonel Fitzwilliam!


466
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,243
The younger son of the Earl of Matlock!


467
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,620
They have vouchsafed us
the greatest honour.


468
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,789
They are coming to call upon us!


469
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,584
- When, my dear ?
- Even now, Mrs Collins!


470
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,086
They're hard upon my heels! Make haste!


471
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,422
This must be due to you.


472
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,216
Mr Darcy wouldn't come so soon
to wait upon me.


473
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,053
Y ou're mistaken, for he dislikes me
as much as I do him.


474
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,347
Make haste! Make haste!


475
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,603
Delighted to make
your acquaintance at last!


476
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:05,729
At last, sir ?


477
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,024
I've heard much of you,
and the praise hasn't been exaggerated.


478
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,486
I can well believe that.
Mr Darcy is my severest critic.


479
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,031
I hope we shall see you
frequently at Rosings.


480
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:20,577
- I'm fond of lively conversation.
- This you do not find at Rosings Park?


481
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:24,581
My aunt does talk a great deal,
but seldom requires a response.


482
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,627
My friend speaks hardly a word
when he comes into Kent,


483
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,213
though he's lively in other places.


484
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:34,341
Nobody plays, nobody sings.


485
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:38,345
- I believe you play and sing?
- A little, and very ill.


486
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,931
I wouldn't wish to excite
your anticipation.


487
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,641
I'm sure you're too modest.


488
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,727
Any relief would be profoundly welcome.


489
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:51,024
Can you tell me why Mr Darcy
keeps staring at me?


490
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,401
What do you think offends him?


491
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,289
- I hope your family is in good health.
- I thank you, yes.


492
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,172
My sister has been in town
these three months.


493
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,924
Have you not seen her ?


494
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,219
No.


495
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,347
No, I have not had that pleasure.


496
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,401
Mr Darcy and I
are not the best of friends.


497
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,361
I'm surprised.


498
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,865
Why should you be?
I always believe in first impressions,


499
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,077
and his good opinion once lost,
is lost forever.


500
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,835
So you see, it is a hopeless case,
is it not, Colonel Fitzwilliam?


501
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:34,521
You will never play really well,
Miss Bennet, unless you practise more.


502
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,649
(LADY CATHERINE): You may come
to Rosings as often as you like,


503
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,945
and play on the pianoforte
in Mrs Jenkinson's room.


504
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:46,449
She would be in nobody's way
in that part of the house.


505
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,534
Thank you, ma'am.


506
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:49,285
There are few people in England,


507
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:54,749
I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
in music than myself.


508
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:58,837
(LADY CATHERINE): Or a better taste.


509
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,759
And if I had ever learnt,
I should be a true proficient.


510
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,846
(LADY CATHERINE): And so would Anne.


511
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,146
Do you mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy,
by coming in all this state to hear me?


512
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:17,689
I won't be alarmed.


513
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:21,943
My courage always rises
with every attempt to intimidate me.


514
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,448
I know you find great enjoyment
in professing opinions


515
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,742
which are not your own.


516
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,535
Your cousin would teach you


517
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,371
not to believe a word I say,
Colonel Fitzwilliam.


518
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:37,792
- That is ungenerous of him, is it not?
- It is indeed, Darcy!


519
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,212
Impolitic too,
for it provokes me to retaliate


520
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,548
and say somewhat of his behaviour
in Hertfordshire,


521
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,050
which may shock his relations.


522
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:49,721
- I'm not afraid of you.
- What can you accuse him of?


523
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,057
I should like to know how he behaves
among strangers!


524
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:56,144
The first time I ever saw Mr Darcy
was at a ball,


525
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,064
where he danced only four dances,
though gentlemen were scarce,


526
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:04,986
and more than one lady
was in want of a partner.


527
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,907
- I'm sorry, but so it was.
- I can well believe it!


528
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,160
I fear I am ill qualified
to recommend myself to strangers.


529
00:40:13,495 --> 00:40:15,580
Shall we ask him why?


530
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:20,752
Why a man of sense and education,
who has lived in the world,


531
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:24,506
should be ill qualified
to recommend himself to strangers?


532
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,551
I...


533
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,223
I have not that talent
which some possess,


534
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:35,391
of conversing easily with strangers.


535
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:41,272
I do not play this instrument
so well as I should wish to,


536
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,609
but I have supposed that
to be my own fault,


537
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,320
because I would not take the trouble
of practising!


538
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:54,077
You are perfectly right.
You have employed your time much better.


539
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:57,747
No one privileged of hearing you
could think anything wanting.


540
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,794
We neither of us perform to strangers.


541
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,049
(LADY CATHERINE): What are you
talking of?


542
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,926
What are you telling Miss Bennet?


543
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,012
I must have my share
in the conversation!


544
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:16,182
<i>As for the daughter,
she is a pale sickly creature</i>


545
00:41:16,266 --> 00:41:18,518
<i>with little conversation and no talent.</i>


546
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:21,980
<i>I'm sorry to be hard
on any of our sex, but...</i>


547
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,399
<i>Mr Darcy shows no inclination for her,</i>


548
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,236
<i>and treats her with the same
indifference he shows everyone,</i>


549
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,990
<i>but Lady Catherine is determined
to have him for a son-in-law,</i>


550
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,659
<i>and she is not a woman to be gainsaid.</i>


551
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,828
(THE DOORBELL RINGS)


552
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,592
Mr Darcy.


553
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,888
Mrs Collins and Maria


554
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,182
are just now gone into Hunsford village
with my cousin.


555
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,185
You find me all alone this morning,
Mr Darcy.


556
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,315
I beg your pardon. I would not wish
to intrude upon your privacy.


557
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,779
I was just writing a letter
to my sister Jane in London.


558
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:36,262
Mr Bingley and his sisters were well,
I hope, when you left London?


559
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,641
Perfectly so, I thank you.


560
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:44,312
I understand Mr Bingley has not much
idea for ever returning to Netherfield?


561
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:50,693
It is probable that he may spend
little time there in the future.


562
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:55,198
If so, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he give up the place.


563
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,866
I should not be surprised
if he were to give it up,


564
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,702
as soon as any eligible purchase offers.


565
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:14,092
This seems a very comfortable house.


566
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,971
Lady Catherine, I believe,
did much to it when Mr Collins came.


567
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,430
I believe she did.


568
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:23,267
And she couldn't have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful recipient.


569
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,772
Mr Collins appears extremely fortunate
in his choice of wife.


570
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:32,443
Yes, indeed he is.
Though seen in a prudential light,


571
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:34,821
it is a good match for her as well.


572
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:40,576
It must be agreeable to her to live
within easy distance of her family.


573
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,621
Easy distance? It's nearly fifty miles!


574
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:47,500
What is fifty miles of good road?
Yes, an easy distance.


575
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,961
Near and far are relative terms.


576
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,840
It is possible for a woman
to be settled too near her family.


577
00:43:53,923 --> 00:43:55,216
Yes, exactly.


578
00:43:56,551 --> 00:44:00,138
You would not wish to be always
near Longbourn, I think.


579
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:08,813
I shall trespass on your time no longer.


580
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,941
Please convey my regards to
Mrs Collins and her sister.


581
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:16,070
No, no, please don't trouble yourself.


582
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,388
- Miss Bennet!
- Colonel Fitzwilliam.


583
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,773
I've been making the yearly tour
of the Park.


584
00:44:51,856 --> 00:44:53,024
Shall we take this way together ?


585
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,609
With pleasure.


586
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,908
Do you know Mr Bingley and his sisters?


587
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,493
A little.


588
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:06,662
Bingley is a pleasant,
gentleman-like man.


589
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:08,247
He's a great friend of Darcy's.


590
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:11,918
Yes. Mr Darcy is uncommonly
kind to Mr Bingley,


591
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,711
and takes a prodigious
deal of care of him.


592
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:16,631
Yes, I believe Darcy
does take care of him.


593
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:21,928
I... I understand
that he congratulates himself


594
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,971
on having saved Mr Bingley


595
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:27,100
the inconvenience
of a most imprudent marriage.


596
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:33,356
Did Mr Darcy give his reasons
for this interference?


597
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:37,235
I understand there were some very strong
objections to the lady.


598
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:39,987
And why was he to be the judge?


599
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,407
You're disposed to think
his interference officious ?


600
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,285
I don't see what right Mr Darcy had
to determine and direct


601
00:45:46,369 --> 00:45:49,122
in what way his friend was to be happy.


602
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,376
But, as you say,
we know none of the particulars.


603
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,921
- Perhaps there was not much affection.
- Perhaps not.


604
00:45:57,422 --> 00:45:58,506
But if that were the case,


605
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:03,010
it lessens the honour of my cousin's
triumph very sadly, don't you think?


606
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:14,605
- Miss Bennet, are you unwell?
- A sudden headache.


607
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:18,860
Perhaps I have walked too far today.


608
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,446
Let us take the shorter way back.


609
00:46:28,995 --> 00:46:32,165
Y ou're sure ?
I would willingly stay at home with you,


610
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:34,250
and brave
all Lady Catherine's displeasure.


611
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,128
My dear Charlotte,
I beg you to consider...


612
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,797
I shall be quite all right.
It's only a headache.


613
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:43,509
It will pass, and more speedily
in quiet and solitude.


614
00:46:43,593 --> 00:46:44,760
I am quite sure,


615
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:48,014
when all the circumstances
are explained to Lady Catherine,


616
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,557
she will not be angry,


617
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,977
for she has indeed
such Christian generosity of spirit...


618
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,940
- My dear, the time!
- My dear! Why did you not say before?


619
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,734
I cannot begin to count the occasions


620
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:05,448
on which her ladyship has impressed
upon me the importance of punctuality...


621

(DOORBELL RINGS)


622
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,114
Forgive me.
I hope you are feeling better.


623
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,618
I am, thank you.


624
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,163
Will you not sit down?


625
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,091
In vain I have struggled.
It will not do!


626
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,761
My feelings will not be repressed.


627
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:54,515
You must allow me to tell you
how ardently I admire and love you.


628
00:48:57,685 --> 00:48:59,937
In declaring myself thus I'm aware


629
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,274
that I will be going expressly against
the wishes of my family,


630
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:07,111
my friends, and, I hardly need add,
my own better judgement.


631
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:09,822
The relative situation of our families


632
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:14,368
makes any alliance between us
a reprehensible connection.


633
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:21,167
As a rational man I cannot but regard it
as such myself, but it cannot be helped.


634
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:26,839
Almost from the earliest moments,
I have come to feel for you...


635
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:32,511
..a passionate admiration and regard,


636
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,266
which despite my struggles,
has overcome every rational objection.


637
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,812
I beg you, most fervently,
to relieve my suffering


638
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,981
and consent to be my wife.


639
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,904
In such cases as these,


640
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:54,158
I believe the established mode
is to express a sense of obligation.


641
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,078
But I cannot.


642
00:50:01,749 --> 00:50:03,542
I have never desired your good opinion,


643
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,962
and you have certainly bestowed it
most unwillingly.


644
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:12,176
I'm sorry to cause pain to anyone,
but it was unconsciously done,


645
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,887
and I hope will be of short duration.


646
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,076
And this is all the reply
I am to expect?


647
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,791
I might wonder why, with so little
effort at civility, I am rejected.


648
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:47,461
I might wonder why,
with so evident a desire to offend me,


649
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,047
you chose to tell me that
you like me against your will,


650
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:53,134
your reason, and
even against your character!


651
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,471
Was this not some excuse
for incivility if I was uncivil?


652
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:03,102
I have every reason in the world
to think ill of you.


653
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,814
What could tempt me to accept the man


654
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,651
who has ruined the happiness
of a most beloved sister ?


655
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,864
Can you deny that you have done it?


656
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:17,825
I have no wish to deny it.


657
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,579
I did everything in my power
to separate my friend from your sister,


658
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,290
and I rejoice in my success.


659
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,876
Towards him I have been kinder
than towards myself.


660
00:51:26,959 --> 00:51:31,213
It's not merely that on which
my dislike of you is founded.


661
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:34,258
Long before, my dislike was decided


662
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,678
when I heard Mr Wickham's story
of your dealings with him.


663
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:40,389
How can you defend yourself
on that subject?


664
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:43,225
Such interest
in that gentleman's concerns!


665
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,729
Who that knows of his misfortunes,
can help feeling an interest?


666
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:50,357
His misfortunes! Yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed!


667
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,610
And of your infliction!


668
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,112
You have reduced him
to his present state of poverty,


669
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:59,450
and yet you can treat his misfortunes
with contempt and ridicule!


670
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,706
And this is your opinion of me?


671
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:10,211
My faults by this calculation
are heavy indeed.


672
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,676
Perhaps these offences
might have been overlooked,


673
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,180
had not your pride been hurt
by the confession of the scruples


674
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,391
long prevented my forming
serious design on you.


675
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:28,479
Had I concealed my struggles
and flattered you.


676
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,774
But disguise of every sort
is my abhorrence.


677
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,570
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings
I related. They were natural.


678
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,574
Did you expect me to rejoice
in the inferiority of your connections?


679
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,618
To congratulate myself
on the hope of relations


680
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,829
whose condition in life
is so below my own?


681
00:52:47,623 --> 00:52:50,042
You are mistaken, Mr Darcy.


682
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:54,213
Your declaration merely spared me
any concern for refusing you,


683
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,757
had you been more gentleman-like.


684
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,678
You could not make me
the offer of your hand in any way


685
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,180
that would tempt me to accept it.


686
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:08,185
From the beginning, your manners
convinced me of your arrogance,


687
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:11,480
your conceit, and your selfish disdain
for the feelings of others.


688
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:16,193
Within a month, I felt you were the
last man whom I could ever marry!


689
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,905
You've said quite enough, madam.


690
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,450
I perfectly comprehend your feelings...


691
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:29,164
..and now have only to be ashamed of
what my own have been.


692
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,876
Please forgive me
for having taken up your time...


693
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
..and accept my best wishes
for your health and happiness.
