1
00:00:02,696 --> 00:00:04,011
Who wants the
last dumpling?

2
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:05,362
Ooh, me!

3
00:00:05,364 --> 00:00:06,730
Penny, a moment.

4
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:08,815
We just had Thai food.

5
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:11,735
In that culture,
the last morsel is called

6
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:14,905
the "greng jie" piece,
and it is reserved for

7
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:18,041
the most important
and valued member of the group.

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:27,050
Thank you all
for this high honor.

9
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:31,922
I've seen pictures
of your mother; keep eating.

10
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,846
All right, honey, if we're gonna
make the movie, we should go.

11
00:00:43,184 --> 00:00:45,435
This may be hard
for you to hear,

12
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:48,522
but when I say "honey,"
I mean my fiancée.

13
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:53,360
Yeah, well, now it means her.

14
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:57,080
It's okay if he
wants to come.

15
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:59,699
Fine. But next time,
we get a sitter.

16
00:01:01,285 --> 00:01:03,253
All right, I got to go to work.
I'll walk down with you.

17
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:04,504
Wait.

18
00:01:04,506 --> 00:01:07,407
Which is closer to the new
train store in Monrovia,

19
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,593
the movie theater
or The Cheesecake Factory?

20
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:11,678
Neither of them are close.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Oh, well, then I guess
it doesn't matter which one

22
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,598
of you drives me.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,049
Let's play a fun guessing game

24
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,767
to see who gets to take me.

25
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:21,138
All right, this four-letter word
describes either

26
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,058
a printer's type size
or a compulsion to eat dirt.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,810
Okay, I'm not driving him.

28
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:29,229
Penny, don't give up,
you can get this.

29
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:34,951
Aren't you going
with Sheldon?

30
00:01:34,953 --> 00:01:38,238
No, I have no interest
in model trains,

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,992
stores that sell them, nor
their heartbreaking clientele.

32
00:01:41,994 --> 00:01:43,210
Oh.

33
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:46,413
Well, I have
some work to do, so...

34
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,181
I can't imagine
that would disturb me.

35
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:49,483
Carry on.

36
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,886
Okay.

37
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,138
Wouldn't you be
more comfortable at home?

38
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,228
Not really, no.

39
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,430
All righty then.

40
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,649
Guess I'll just
get started.

41
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:08,068
Leonard, please. I don't need
the running commentary.

52
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,197
(sighs softly)

53
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:56,317
- Amy?
- Yo.

54
00:02:57,892 --> 00:02:58,670
You okay?

55
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,571
Oh, sure.

56
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,507
I thought you were reading.

57
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,425
I was.

58
00:03:05,427 --> 00:03:08,178
Now I'm thinking about
what I read.

59
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:21,708
You all right, Leonard?

60
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,027
You seem very uncomfortable.

61
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:27,114
I-I'm fine.

62
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,032
Should I go?

63
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,451
I've been told sometimes
I overstay my welcome.

64
00:03:31,453 --> 00:03:34,638
Wha... who told you that?

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,042
Well, most recently
my gynecologist.

66
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,783
Well, you stay
as long as you'd like.

67
00:03:46,785 --> 00:03:48,335
I'm glad to hear you say that,

68
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:51,388
because I'm having
a wonderful time.

69
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,472
(chuckles)

70
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:56,226
I said the same thing
to my gynecologist.

71
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:02,983
What are you going to get
at the train store, Sheldon?

72
00:04:02,985 --> 00:04:04,935
Oh, I'm not
buying anything.

73
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:06,970
They're having a lecture.

74
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:09,072
"H-O gauge railroading.

75
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:12,692
Half the size of O-gauge,
but twice the fun."

76
00:04:12,694 --> 00:04:16,079
Very controversial topic.

77
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,981
Which side do you come down on?

78
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:20,083
I'll let you know after tonight.

79
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:22,786
Unlike some people,
I'm going in with an open mind.

80
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:24,671
Who am I kidding?

81
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,824
Of course we all know
it's O-gauge or no gauge.

82
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:32,012
Can you believe grown men sit
around and play with toy trains?

83
00:04:32,014 --> 00:04:34,264
That's pretty big talk
for a man

84
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:37,517
with a closet full of magic
tricks at his mother's house.

85
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,555
First of all, they're not
tricks, they're illusions.

86
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,723
And...

87
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:46,276
secondly, when we get
married, they're all going up

88
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,112
in the attic so you can have
that closet for clothes.

89
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:52,032
Why would I keep clothes
at your mother's house?

90
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:53,700
Well, don't think
of it that way.

91
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:55,852
Once we move in,
it'll be our house.

92
00:04:55,854 --> 00:04:57,320
Is she moving out?

93
00:04:57,322 --> 00:04:58,688
Why would
she move out?

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,457
It's her house.

95
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:02,859
Hang on.

96
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,046
You seriously think I'm going
to live with your mother?

97
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:07,664
Howard, I think
I can help here.

98
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:10,300
Yes, Bernadette,
that's exactly what he thinks.

99
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,418
Why not?

100
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,503
It's a great house,
plenty of room,

101
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,589
and if we have kids,
Mom's there to help.

102
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:17,474
You know, en she tells "The
Three Little Pigs" story,

103
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:21,261
she actually has hair
on her chinny-chin-chin.

104
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,763
I'm not gonna live
with your mother.

105
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,549
Not now, not ever.

106
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:30,237
Wow, someone obviously
has some mommy issues.

107
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:33,890
Raj, take me home.

108
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:36,326
Don't listen to her.
Go to the movie theater.

109
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:37,694
Take me home now.

110
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:38,662
Movie theater!

111
00:05:38,664 --> 00:05:39,663
(groans)

112
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,198
Okay, everybody
calm down.

113
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,867
There is a simple
solution here.

114
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,452
Raj, take me to the train store,

115
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:47,754
and then I don't care
what you people do.

116
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:56,713
How was your shower?

117
00:05:56,715 --> 00:06:00,083
It was good, good.

118
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:03,353
Just out of curiosity, what time
do you usually go to bed?

119
00:06:03,355 --> 00:06:04,688
Oh, I'm up all night.

120
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,439
I'm like a possum.

121
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:11,161
Boy, you were not liked
in high school, were you?

122
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:12,679
Not really.

123
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:14,531
- Is that my yearbook?
- Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,700
"Dear Leonard,
you're really good at science.

125
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:20,403
Maybe one day you'll come up
with a cure for being a dork."

126
00:06:20,405 --> 00:06:22,906
Well, it wasn't spray-painting
a lightning bolt

127
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:26,042
on my briefcase,
I can tell you that.

128
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,460
If it makes you feel any better,

129
00:06:27,462 --> 00:06:29,713
the only person who signed
my yearbook was my mother.

130
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:31,648
- Aw.
- "Dear Amy,

131
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,250
"Self-respect and a hymen
are better than friends and fun.

132
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,585
Love, Mom."

133
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,956
Well, you can add
Jerry's Junction

134
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,558
to the list of train stores

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,961
Sheldon Cooper will never
set foot in again.

136
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:47,580
Rough night, Casey Jones?

137
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:49,349
You don't know
the half of it.

138
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:50,734
It was billed

139
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:53,687
as a lively give-and-take on
the merits of model train sizes.

140
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,239
But it was actually a setup
to intimidate

141
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:59,826
weak-minded spineless rubes
into buying H-O starter sets.

142
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:00,944
What's in the bag?

143
00:07:00,946 --> 00:07:04,364
I don't want to talk about it.

144
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:07,250
But it's not a spine,
I'll tell you that.

145
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,919
Well, I had a delightful
evening, Leonard.

146
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:11,254
We should do this
again sometime.

147
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,289
Ah, sure.
That'd be nice.

148
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,374
Glad to hear it.

149
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:16,159
I need someone to accompany me
to the wedding

150
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:18,378
of Dr. Moranelli
and Dr. Gustufson this Friday.

151
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,013
They're kind of
the Brad and Angelina

152
00:07:20,015 --> 00:07:21,998
of the primatology department.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,433
Wouldn't you rather
bring Sheldon?

154
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:26,920
I would, but the last wedding
we went to was a disaster.

155
00:07:26,922 --> 00:07:29,356
He behaved like a child
the entire time.

156
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,690
Not my fault.

157
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:33,943
You said there'd be
other scientists there my age.

158
00:07:37,698 --> 00:07:39,282
Doesn't matter.
You're out, he's in.

159
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:41,735
No date to the prom,
two dates to a wedding.

160
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:44,821
Hmm, how times change.

161
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:50,827
(singsongy): Ha-ha, you have
to go to a wedding.

162
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:55,865
(doorbell rings)

163
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:56,866
WOLOWITZ:
I'll get it!

164
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,034
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Could you get it?!

165
00:07:58,036 --> 00:07:59,469
I just said
I'm getting it!

166
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,870
Fine, I'll get it!

167
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:03,506
I got it!

168
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:06,092
Oh, hi.

169
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:07,343
Hey.

170
00:08:07,345 --> 00:08:08,812
I don't want to fight.

171
00:08:08,814 --> 00:08:10,930
I was just surprised
when you sprung

172
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:12,816
the whole living-with-your-mom
stuff on me.

173
00:08:12,818 --> 00:08:17,237
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I
didn't run it by you first.

174
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,355
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I don't know who
you're talking to,

175
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,390

We don't need bugs!

177
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,662
The bugs
only come here

178

their queen!

Before we make any
kind of decision

181
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,173
about where we live,
we have a trial run.

182
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,175
Stay here for a weekend,
see what it's like.

183
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:41,177
And your mom would be
okay with that?

184
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,462
Sure she would.

185
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:45,081
Ma, do you mind if Bernadette
stays here this weekend?!

186

MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hey, if she's willing to
give the milk away for free,

187
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:49,969
who am I to say no?!

188
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,058
See? She's
good with it.

189
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,593
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Frankly, after all
your sleepovers

190
00:08:57,595 --> 00:09:01,481
with the little brown boy,
a girl is a big relief!

191
00:09:13,615 --> 00:09:16,818
All these years,
I've been so wrong.

192
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,855
The tinier the train,
the more concentrated the fun.

193
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,627
You're a brain scientist.

194
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:28,696
Can you explain to me
why a brilliant man

195
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,030
likes playing
with toy trains?

196
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:32,717
Not without cutting
his head open, no.

197
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:36,637
How about making my
eyes like Cleopatra?

198
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,589
Really? For a wedding?

199
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:39,924
Perhaps you're right.

200
00:09:39,926 --> 00:09:41,542
My cheekbones and
beckoning pelvis

201
00:09:41,544 --> 00:09:44,178

sailor" quality to them.

00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:49,567

00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,352
So handsome.

205
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:53,487
Like James Bond.

206
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:57,491
He's better than James Bond,
because he's tinier.

207
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:00,845
I got you this
to give to me.

208
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:04,081
Oh, sweetie,
guests don't normally

210

That's more of a prom thing.

211
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,336
I never went to my prom.

212
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:10,087
My mom paid my cousin
to take me,

213
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:13,174
but he just used the money
to buy drugs.

214
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:15,793
Put the corsage on her.

215
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,936
When you're done copping a
feel, that goes on my wrist.

Does your mother always
cut your meat for you?

Only when it's fatty.

Well, don't be jealous, babe.

350
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,492
So, um, what are
you gonna do?

351
00:17:11,494 --> 00:17:14,411
Do you want me to talk
to Leonard, let him down easy?

352
00:17:14,413 --> 00:17:16,780
No. I'll let him have tonight.

353
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:17,865
Then in the morning,

354
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,667
I'll send him an e-mail
letting him know

355
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:22,252
this body is never
gonna be his wonderland.

356
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:26,907
I mean, frankly, you've got
a better shot than he does.

357
00:17:36,768 --> 00:17:38,085
Leonard.

358
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:39,553
Check it out.

359
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,755
I bought an N-gauge locomotive.

360
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:43,857
Half the size of H-O.

361
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:47,361
Look, it fits in my mouth.

362
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:49,697
Sounds like you
had a <i>great</i> night.

363
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:51,765
(muffled):
I did.

364
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:54,702
- How was yours?
- Not bad. I had a lot more fun

365
00:17:54,704 --> 00:17:56,436
with Amy than I
thought I would.

366
00:17:56,438 --> 00:17:58,822
What exact
do you mean by that?

367
00:17:58,824 --> 00:18:00,407
Well, it turns out
she really knows

368
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,160
how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.

369
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:07,164
Although, truth be told, my
groin's a little worse for wear.

370
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,300
Ow!

371
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:13,887
Why did you do that?

372
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,391
To send a message:
she is not for you.

373
00:18:17,393 --> 00:18:18,792
What?

374
00:18:18,794 --> 00:18:20,144
Not for you!

375
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,515
Good morning, handsome.

376
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:38,334
Morning, Mom.

377
00:18:39,637 --> 00:18:41,521
It's me.

378
00:18:43,641 --> 00:18:47,343
Yes, it is, and you're
so pretty in the morning.

379
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:51,014
Your mom and I
made you breakfast.

380
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:52,399
(laughs)
Oh, wow.

381
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:54,618
So you guys are getting along?

382
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,236
Yeah, I guess.

383
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,021
We're very different
people, Howard,

384
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,857
so communication's
a little tricky.

385
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,743
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Does he like the pancakes?!

386
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:05,045
He didn't try them yet!

387
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,199
Is there any butter?

388
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:11,218
- It's butter-flavored syrup.
- Oh.

389
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,886
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
So, what's the word?!

390
00:19:12,888 --> 00:19:15,138
He wants butter!

391
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:18,675
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
It's butter-flavored syrup!

392
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:21,344
I just told him that!

393
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,685
I don't need any butter.

394
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:32,105
If you want butter,
I'll get you butter.

395
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:37,527
Well, I guess
I'll cut these by myself.

396
00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:41,529
