1
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,920
- Coach.
- Yes, Frank?

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,960
- Where do I go?
- Proceed to the hub.

3
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,360
Got ya.

4
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,880
- How will I know who he is?
- This is him.

5
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Hi. Oh, oh.

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,400
Sorry. Fork.

7
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,320
-Amy.
-No, no, my name's not fork.

8
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,480
-I guessed. It was just--
-It's Frank.

9
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,640
- Do you wanna sit? Shall we sit?
- I think it's that or stand.

10
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,920
Come sit, yeah?

11
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,520
Oh, oh! That's, um... I was on that side.

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
-Oh. Shall I...?
-No, no, it doesn't matter.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,640
Why bring it up?

14
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Sorry. I'm so bloody nervous.

15
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,560
It's my first time on the,
you know, the system.

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,680
-Me too.
-Oh, really?

17
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,520
Yeah, I'm shitting it, mate.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,120
-Come to mention it, you look terrified.
-Do I?

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,920
-Yeah, quaking with fear.
-Or maybe shaking with revulsion?

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,160
At least you stopped... shitting.

21
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,560
Oh!

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you sure about that?

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
-Shall we stop talking about shitting?
-Maybe order some food? Good plan.

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Yeah. OK.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,240
-Do you know how we order?
-I think we use these.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,880
- Oh!
- Menu choice already established.

27
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,200
- Oh. Ta.
- Here you are, sir.

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
And for you, madam.

29
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,600
Well, evidently I'm a pasta girl.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah, I'm a, uh...

31
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,960
...fishcake...

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
- Hmm.
- Mmm.

33
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
-It's good.
-Can I try some?

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Are we... allowed to do that?

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,800
Fuck it.

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,720
Yeah, fuck it.

37
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,960
-Mm. That is good.
-Mm-hmm.

38
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,760
So... we're both first-timers.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,760
Hmm.

40
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,560
-Shall we check our expiry date?
-Yeah, good plan.

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,080
Yeah? All right, um,
so I think it's under "info."

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,080
Yeah, uh, "tap to reveal."
We have to tap to reveal at the same time.

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,240
OK. So, on three, two, one. Go.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,960
-Twelve hours.
-Yeah, 12 hours.

45
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,800
-OK.
-Bit, um...

46
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,120
-Yeah.
-Bit short.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,960
-It is a bit short, isn't it?
-Hmm.

48
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh. And getting shorter.
I didn't realize it would...

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,400
sort of count down like that.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
It's sort of sad.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Maybe we should eat quickly.

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,440
-Yeah. Yeah, maybe we should.
-The race is on.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,280
Come on, hurry up.

54
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,800
I guess this is us.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,839
And this takes us to the place?

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Yeah, suppose so.

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,760
- After you.
- Thank you.

58
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
It's massive.

59
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
- Here we are.
- Yep.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,080
Huh.

61
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,920
-Do you wanna open it or shall I?
-You go ahead.

62
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,160
-All right.
-Ha! Too slow.

63
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
You're a knob.

64
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,040
Oh, God. It's a shithole.

65
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,600
-You're kidding.
-I am, yeah.

66
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
Ooh!

67
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,080
It's nice. I, uh, like that lamp.

68
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,520
- Yeah, it's incredible, that lamp.
- Fuck off.

69
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Hmm.

70
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,840
Right. That's, uh...

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
There's an en suite.

72
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,640
-Shower or bath?
-Both.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,680
Ah. That's good.

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,680
Uh. Well, I'm...
I'm just gonna use the loo.

75
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, I've got to, uh... over here, so...

76
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,840
Yeah.

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
OK, seriously, what are we meant to do?

78
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,600
Query too broad. Please narrow.

79
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,360
Well, I mean, are we just meant to...
I don't know, like, just go at it?

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,760
Define "go at it."

81
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
Fucking hell.

82
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,760
So, are we meant to just
have sex with each other?

83
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,960
Participants are not required
to take any specific action.

84
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,520
Yeah, but I mean we can, right?

85
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,600
I mean, people do
if it's just a short time?

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,240
If that's your decision.

87
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,720
- It's up to us?
- It's up to you.

88
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,680
I could just sleep here.

89
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,760
Don't be daft.
You'll be scrunched up in a ball.

90
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
It's not awful.

91
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,680
The bed's pretty big.
I'm sure we could both fit in it.

92
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,960
Yeah, OK.

93
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,880
Must have been mental before the system.

94
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,560
How do you mean?

95
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,720
Well, people had to do
the whole relationship thing themselves,

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,960
work out who they wanna be with.

97
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,880
Hmm. Option paralysis.

98
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,840
So many choices, you end up
not knowing which one you want.

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah, exactly, and if things seem shitty,

100
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,440
they'd have to figure out whether
they wanted to break up with someone.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,440
How to break up with someone.
Fuckin' hell.

102
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,160
-Just a nightmare.
-It's not like when it's all mapped out.

103
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,880
God, no. It's so much simpler
when it's all mapped out.

104
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,000
Hmm.

105
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,440
-This is weird, though.
-It really is. Hmm.

106
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
-Well, then.
-So...

107
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,840
Thanks for being my first.

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
Oh. Yeah.

109
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,960
Bloody time.

110
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,200
It was great, you know. You were nice.

111
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,080
So were you.

112
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,920
If we had this time again,
you would totally get it, by the way.

113
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,160
-Oh, you... You bastard.
-Sorry.

114
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
-You'd get it, too.
-Fucked that one up, didn't we?

115
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,840
Yeah, totally.

116
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,320
I guess I just don't see the point
in something that short. Twelve hours.

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,440
Even your reaction to a brief encounter

118
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,200
provides the system
with valuable information.

119
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,360
Yeah, well, I didn't even do anything.
The system thinks I'm a prude.

120
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,480
The system makes
no moral judgments.

121
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, but how do I know she wasn't
the perfect match for me? She was...

122
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,880
Your ultimate compatible other
has not yet been selected.

123
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah, I know, but it's--

124
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
The system gains insight
as each participant progresses

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,640
through numerous relationships

126
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,680
and uses the gathered data to eventually
select an ultimate compatible other.

127
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,280
On your pairing day, I know,
and it always finds your perfect match.

128
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,840
In 99.8% of cases.

129
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,120
But I have to go through
loads of relationships to find it.

130
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
- That is correct.
- Great.

131
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
What was that?

132
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,760
- Another relationship.
- What, already?

133
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,600
What's this, another one?

134
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,320
That is correct.

135
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
I'd best go get changed, then.

136
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,480
Holy fuck. Tell me that's him.

137
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,440
I cannot confirm identity
until a personal introduction is made.

138
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
-Hi.
-Hi.

139
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Identity confirmed.

140
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,200
-I like your hair.
-Yours is good too.

141
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,960
It's all my own.

142
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,360
It's just funny.

143
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,320
Hi.

144
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,240
I'm Frank.

145
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,480
Hmm.

146
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
Nicola. I've been here a while.

147
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,760
Aye, sorry. I was getting changed.

148
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,960
-Really?
-You started already?

149
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,840
-I was hungry.
-Yeah, course, yeah. Sorry.

150
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,800
Come on, let's get it over with.
Checking the expiry.

151
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,520
Oh! Yeah, yeah.

152
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,200
One year.

153
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,720
We've got each other for one year?
Could be a mistake.

154
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,360
- Coach, is this a mistake?
- This is not a mistake.

155
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,200
Jesus fucking Christ.

156
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,360
There'll be a reason.

157
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,280
Thanks.

158
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,360
Look on the bright side.
Chicken tikka masala.

159
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,960
What?

160
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,720
Chicken tikka mas-- It's a joke.

161
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,240
Right. So you're the sort of person
that makes jokes.

162
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,000
-OK, so on three.
-Two, one.

163
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,360
Oh. Interesting.

164
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,600
Nine months.

165
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,520
Well... cheers.

166
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,480
Cheers.

167
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Pretty much the same as my last one.

168
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,840
-How many of these have you had?
-Relationships? So far? Five.

169
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,240
- Oh.
- I'm an old hand, I suppose.

170
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Listen, I'm just gonna jump in the shower.

171
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
-OK.
-Won't be long.

172
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,480
Hey.

173
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,120
Hi.

174
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,480
So, listen, if you're OK with it,
this is relationship five for me,

175
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,200
and I've found it's best to have sex
straight away upfront.

176
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,440
Right, yeah.

177
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,800
Kind of breaks the ice, gives an early
overview of compatibility and so on.

178
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Yep.

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,560
So I'm consenting to everything now.

180
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,440
Whenever you feel comfortable
doing the same--

181
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,080
Tikka masala. Just...

182
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,880
- What?
- It's a bit tikka masala.

183
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,600
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- Talking makes it worse.

184
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Sorry.

185
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,400
No, no, you're gonna have to do it
from behind.

186
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,280
- You what?
- From behind.

187
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,000
Bit faster?

188
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,560
More motion.

189
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,000
Not like that. More motion.
You're all in out, in out,

190
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,440
like you're trying to shut a drawer
into a filing cabinet.

191
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,400
- Sorry.
- It's just boring.

192
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,120
Want a bit more side to side.

193
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,680
Like this?

194
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,520
No, not really.

195
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,600
What was that?

196
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,000
-Nothing.
-Hmm.

197
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,040
Fucking hell.

198
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,280
So I can't just walk away?

199
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,000
That is correct.

200
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,120
One day it will provide you
with the ultimate match.

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,880
One day. One day.

202
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
So I'd just like to say,

203
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,240
do have faith in the system,
because it does deliver.

204
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,560
It did for us.

205
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,160
You have so many experiences,

206
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,720
and then one day it pairs you up
with your ultimate match,

207
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,280
the best in show, as it were.

208
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Ha.

209
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
So if you're having doubts,
just hang on in there.

210
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,880
Because it really does work.

211
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,600
Garlic dip. Thanks for that.

212
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,680
- Hi. Hi.
- Mm!

213
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,880
Was that, uh, your...?

214
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,800
-Yeah. Nicola.
-Oh. Nicola.

215
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,160
- Hmm.
- Ha.

216
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,040
You OK?

217
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,280
No, you're not being...?
Are you being serious?

218
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,240
Oh, my God.
OK, this is happening. OK, um, just...

219
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh. Thanks.

220
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,600
-You look well.
-Thanks.

221
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,600
I'd return the compliment, but you've just
spat food on my shoe, so...

222
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,960
To be fair, it is a revolting shoe, so...

223
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,680
All the better to kick you with.

224
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,240
Was that really hard?

225
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,680
- Ouch.
- I'm so sorry. Fuck.

226
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,640
Shit.

227
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,240
Oh. Oh! Um... Uh...

228
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,680
Lenny, this is, um, Frank.
Frank, this is Lenny.

229
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
-Hi, Lenny. You all right?
-Hi.

230
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,320
We were together for a bit.

231
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,880
-A small... small bit.
-Yeah, just before we...

232
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,920
So you two...? Oh. That's... that's great.

233
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,920
So, I mean... it looks like you two
make a great team.

234
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah.

235
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,360
- Yeah.
- Um, I'll see you.

236
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,280
Yeah.

237
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,280
-You know that noise you make?
-What noise?

238
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,160
-Do I do that?
-Yeah, you do, quite often.

239
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
Does it bother you?

240
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,640
A bit, yeah.

241
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,840
-I'll try not to.
-OK.

242
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,360
So it's been great, really.

243
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,320
-Shame it has to end.
-But end it must.

244
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
Anyway...

245
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,000
OK, bye.

246
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,080
Another partner already?

247
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,960
That is correct.

248
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,320
So, three, two, one, go.

249
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,400
Thirty-six hours?

250
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,200
Well, uh... bye.

251
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,200
-Bye.
-Bye.

252
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,600
Three, two, one.

253
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,480
-I just wanna say--
-Don't.

254
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,120
Well, I learned what it's like to cohabit
with someone I despise.

255
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,720
- Is that useful for the system?
- Everything happens for a reason.

256
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,120
That's sooner than I expected.

257
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,000
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

258
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,160
Hi.

259
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
Is this right?

260
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,600
- Yeah.
- I mean...

261
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,480
Yeah, I didn't think the system
would hook us up again.

262
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,040
No, me neither. I mean,
I hope it's right, obviously, but...

263
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,720
- Coach, are we sat at the right table?
- Yes, that is correct.

264
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
OK, well...

265
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Wait, um...
Can we not check the expiry date?

266
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,280
-Uh... Why?
-Just sick of it.

267
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,840
The system's just bounced me from bloke
to bloke, short fling after short fling.

268
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,360
I know they're short flings,
they're just meaningless,

269
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,160
and I get really detached.
It's like I'm not really there.

270
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,560
So the other week, I was with this guy,
God knows who, basically just a haircut.

271
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,560
And I literally had
this out-of-body experience.

272
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I wandered out of my body,
and I sat in this chair across the room

273
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,200
and I watched myself fucking this guy.
And I was, like, what is that all about?

274
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
That is literally just a dick
going in and out of a hole.

275
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,720
Yeah, that's pretty detached.

276
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,000
When it's a long-term thing,
it's just as bad,

277
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,560
watching the clock like you're a prisoner,
counting the hours, the minutes.

278
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,240
-Oh, God, I've been there.
-Yeah.

279
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,440
-Yeah, let's not check the expiry, then.
-Yeah.

280
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
-It's a deal.
-Deal.

281
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,200
- OK.
- Bring on les fishcake.

282
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,800
I don't know.

283
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,600
-So?
-So...

284
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,280
-Might as well.
-I suppose we have to.

285
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,000
-Don't know how much time we've got.
-Yeah, it could be ten minutes.

286
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,680
-Think you could last ten minutes?
-Fuck off.

287
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,920
All right. OK, then.

288
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,680
Wait. One of us should
get undressed first.

289
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,280
-Why only one of us?
-It'll be funny.

290
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,680
Go on then. Get your kit off.

291
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,920
No. No, it was my idea.

292
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,040
All right.

293
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,560
This is kind of emasculating.

294
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,440
Well, then, you'd better
make up for it in a minute.

295
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,120
♪ I'm gonna see your dick ♪

296
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,840
Sorry.

297
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,960
-♪  I'm gonna fucking see it ♪
-Yeah, OK. Yeah--

298
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,840
What if there is no scrutiny, it's just
putting us together in any old order,

299
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,480
and we all go along with it 'cause they're
always telling us how clever it is?

300
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,200
Yeah, but it does put people with the one.
It's got a 99.8% success rate.

301
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
But how do you know
they're perfect matches?

302
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,800
I mean, what if all it's actually doing
is gradually wearing us down,

303
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,280
putting us in one relationship
after another

304
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,840
for random durations
in a random sequence?

305
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,760
Each time you get a little bit
more pliable, a little bit more broken,

306
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,280
until eventually it coughs up the final
offering and says that's the one.

307
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:28,480
And by that point
you are so defeated and so exhausted

308
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,600
that you just accept it, you settle.

309
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,440
And then you have to live
the rest of your life

310
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,640
convincing yourself you didn't.

311
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,360
Well done. That's one of
the bleakest things I've ever heard.

312
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,160
Thank you.

313
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,680
Right. Do you wanna know my theory?
Let's assume the system isn't random.

314
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,000
-It's as sophisticated as they say it is.
-OK.

315
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,160
Right, so using these,
it slurps up all your reactions, yeah?

316
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,200
-It builds up a complex profile.
-Mm-hmm.

317
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,680
Every crazy thought you've ever had, all
your dreams and your weaknesses and--

318
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,440
-And your mad theories.
-Yeah, like, everything in your head.

319
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,080
-Right.
-So if it's everything in your head...

320
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,600
-does it have thoughts?
-All right, so now you're gonna say:

321
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,960
"What if that's us
and we're stuck in a simulation?"

322
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,560
Well, how would we know?

323
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,120
I think that settles it.

324
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,440
I might have been programmed to go "Ow."

325
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,400
OK.

326
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
- Hey, come here.
- No.

327
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
- Coach?
- Hello, Frank.

328
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,080
- I've gotta know.
- What would you like to know?

329
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,920
The expiry date for me and Amy.
I need to know how long.

330
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,920
You're not gonna talk me out of it?

331
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Would you like me
to talk you out of it?

332
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,120
Yeah. Uh... No. I...

333
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,840
Don't know.

334
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,840
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I said I wouldn't.

335
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,560
We shook on it.

336
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,679
Fuck it.

337
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,520
Recalibrating.

338
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,480
Coach?

339
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,680
- Coach.
- Recalibrating.

340
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,000
What's happening?
Coach, it's getting shorter.

341
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,320
One-sided observation
has destabilized the expiry date.

342
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,360
- What?
- One-sided observation

343
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,520
has destabilized the expiry date.

344
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,200
Recalibrating.

345
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,520
'Cause I looked at it on my own,
it made it shorter?

346
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
- That is correct.
- Why?

347
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,560
Everything happens for a reason.

348
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,000
All right, well, undo it, then.
Make it go back.

349
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,680
I cannot do that. Recalibrating.

350
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,040
What if she looks at it?

351
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,680
Once shortened,
the expiry date cannot be extended.

352
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,120
Why?

353
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,600
Everything happens for a reason.

354
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,600
- Come on. Come on.
- Recalibrating.

355
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,280
- When will it stop?
- It will stabilize

356
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,360
once recalibration has completed.
Recalibrating.

357
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,840
Stop it. Stop it. Just...

358
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,080
You OK?

359
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

360
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
- All right.
- I'm good.

361
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,560
Have you ever had more than four
or less than four?

362
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,720
What you thinking about?

363
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,680
Nothing.

364
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,360
All right, seriously, what's up?

365
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,760
- I looked.
- Looked at what?

366
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,240
We promised we wouldn't. We shook on it.

367
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,400
-Don't you wanna know what it said?
-No. That was the point.

368
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,520
-It's almost done anyway.
-How almost done?

369
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,840
We've got, like, an hour.

370
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,880
Why didn't you tell me this before?

371
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,600
-Didn't wanna spoil today.
-And this hasn't spoilt it?

372
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,920
It was supposed to be five years,
but now...

373
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,520
I looked at it, something happened,
it started going down.

374
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,560
-I don't know what it was.
-So  you  broke it?

375
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,640
No, no, no, no, no.
I mean, I don't... I don't know.

376
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,920
Why did you have to look at it?

377
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,120
Look, I was thinking maybe
we could overcome it somehow.

378
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,600
Why did you have to look at it?

379
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,000
Because I like you.

380
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,840
Like properly, really, I like you.

381
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,800
-For fuck's sake. And that wasn't enough?
-That's not the point.

382
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,720
-I looked, but that's not the issue here.
-Are you sure about that?

383
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
You're more wound up about that
than how short the time is.

384
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Yes, because we had agreed.

385
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,000
Listen. Listen. Listen.

386
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,000
-What if we just ignore it?
-We can't.

387
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,720
Listen, we'll just fuck the system.
We'll fuck it--

388
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,160
-And do what?
-We'll jump out, over the wall, get out.

389
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,400
-There is nothing out there.
-How d'you know? How d'you know?

390
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,800
-Amy...
-You've ruined this.

391
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,480
You've ruined it.

392
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,640
Hey, it's nothing.

393
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,240
-Amy.
-Don't follow me.

394
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,280
Amy, I'm sorry.

395
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,440
Amy.

396
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,520
- Everything happens for a reason.
- What reason?

397
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,640
The system will be assessing
your reaction

398
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:47,160
to the painful premature termination
of a treasured relationship

399
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:51,600
and will adjust and improve its profile
of your eventual chosen one accordingly.

400
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,440
- You're a great comfort.
- Thank you.

401
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,640
I swear to God,
I feel like scaling the wall out there

402
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,840
and jumping in the fucking wilderness.

403
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,440
That would contravene the rules
of the system.

404
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,680
Oh, the fucking system.

405
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,520
Failure to comply with the system
may result in banishment.

406
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,480
All right, I know.

407
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,120
Christ, will you let me be angry at least?
Will you give me that?

408
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,080
You must vacate your current
living quarters when the time expires.

409
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,000
Like I didn't know.

410
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,200
And if I hadn't have looked,
we'd have been together years.

411
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,080
She was...

412
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:31,320
You know when you meet someone
and you just know? You just know that...

413
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,680
Reckon you could pop this in me now?
I've sort of got jaw ache.

414
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah, come on.

415
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:41,880
And after all that,
he never even apologized, not once.

416
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,520
That's too bad.

417
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,760
Do you mind if I think about her?

418
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,560
If I can think about him?

419
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,680
Yeah, sound.

420
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,840
One, two, three, four.

421
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,840
One, two, three, four.

422
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:40,760
Congratulations, Amy.
Your ultimate match has been identified.

423
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:42,600
Your pairing day is tomorrow.

424
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,560
- Ultimate as in "the one"?
- That is correct.

425
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,920
- And we meet tomorrow?
- That is correct.

426
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,560
Tomorrow you'll be coupled
with your ultimate match

427
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,200
and together
you will leave this place forever.

428
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,160
OK.

429
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,120
Are you allowed
to tell me anything about them?

430
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:03,160
- Do I know them already?
- Negative.

431
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,480
- Right.
- There is one more thing.

432
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,680
Yeah, and what's that?

433
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,400
Prior to pairing day, you have
been allocated a short farewell period

434
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,280
with an individual of your choosing.

435
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,080
A farewell period?
Like, I get to say goodbye to someone?

436
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,640
That is correct.

437
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,320
Data shows this can help provide
psychological closure.

438
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,120
Frank, I choose Frank.

439
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,000
Your choice has been registered.

440
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,120
Wait. Where are we meeting?

441
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,720
Usual booth, 7:30 p.m.

442
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,800
Right.

443
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,600
- Coach?
- Yes, Amy?

444
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,840
Count to four.

445
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,160
One, two, three, four.

446
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,800
Wait, wait. How long have we got?

447
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:24,360
Look, the system's set
my pairing day for tomorrow.

448
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,160
-Yeah, me too.
-Right.

449
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't want whoever the system
reckons the one is, OK?

450
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,120
-I want you.
-I want you.

451
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,000
Failure to comply with the system

452
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,760
-may result in banishment.
-You can fuck off.

453
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,120
Can you remember where you were
before you came here?

454
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,120
You can't, can you?

455
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,280
-No.
-Me neither.

456
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,360
-Why can't I think of that?
-It's a test.

457
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,760
Do you remember the first night
that we were together? How did you feel?

458
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,000
I felt safe, happy, comfortable.

459
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:03,240
It felt right. It felt like something
locked into place, like we'd met before.

460
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,440
Like it had happened before
and it'll happen again,

461
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,200
like it's happened a thousand times
over and over again.

462
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,280
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.

463
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,160
Ever since we've met,
this world has been toying with us.

464
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,520
It's trying to keep us apart. It's...

465
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,040
It's a test, I swear it is,

466
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,120
and the two of us rebelling together
is something to do with passing it.

467
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,600
We've gotta fuck it all off.

468
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,360
Exactly. We've just gotta
fuck the whole thing off and go.

469
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:30,520
-Yeah, over the wall.
-Right over it.

470
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,760
-No matter what's out there.
-OK.

471
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,840
So let's go.

472
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,720
Yeah, let's go.

473
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,600
