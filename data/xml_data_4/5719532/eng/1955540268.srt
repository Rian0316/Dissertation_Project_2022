00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,132
even though he's family?

554
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,933
Unfortunately, yes.

555
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:30,035
If we continue with this,

556
00:32:30,071 --> 00:32:32,505
I'll need your sworn testimony.

557
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,106
[Sighs]

558
00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:36,509
I've had situations
involving family members before

559
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:39,945
where the injured party
has ultimately been reluctant

560
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:41,714
to cooperate with my office.

561
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:43,582
That won't happen.

562
00:32:45,686 --> 00:32:49,588
I'm curious about your strategy.

563
00:32:53,194 --> 00:32:55,361
Well...

564
00:32:55,396 --> 00:32:58,697
as officers of the court,

565
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:01,734
I feel we should be held
to a higher standard.

566
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:04,170
I don't intend to take it
easy on your brother

567
00:33:04,205 --> 00:33:05,671
just because he's a lawyer.

568
00:33:05,706 --> 00:33:06,906
Of course not.

569
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,340
The bone of contention

570
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,176
is going to be the felony
breaking and entering.

571
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,745
Your brother's gonna want
to plead down to a misdemeanor,

572
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,914
but I'll hold the line on the felony.

573
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,248
[Clears throat]

574
00:33:16,284 --> 00:33:18,717
Which means this could possibly go to trial.

575
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:19,985
[Sighs]

576
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:22,388
Now, I... I want to be mindful

577
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,590
of your comfort and well-being.

578
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:26,392
With, with your condition,

579
00:33:26,427 --> 00:33:28,227
are you able to appear before the court?

580
00:33:28,262 --> 00:33:29,829
In person?

581
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:32,064
I certainly appreciate you
accommodating me today

582
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:33,666
by coming here,

583
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:36,202
but don't worry,
I'm able to tolerate being out

584
00:33:36,237 --> 00:33:38,404
for short periods
with a few minor adjustments.

585
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,307
Nothing that will
overly inconvenience the court.

586
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,810
I'll get started on this.

587
00:33:48,082 --> 00:33:51,050
Unless you have other concerns.

588
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:53,219
I just...

589
00:33:53,254 --> 00:33:56,455
I just keep thinking.

590
00:33:58,459 --> 00:34:00,793
[Voice breaking] You know,
Jimmy has a good heart.

591
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:02,194
I'm, I'm sure he does.

592
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,963
It's not an excuse for what he's done.

593
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:07,299
[Sighs] But he's my brother.

594
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:11,036
[Stuttering] And I know... well, he...

595
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,305
well, he's emotional.
He flies off the handle.

596
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:14,640
I understand,

597
00:34:14,675 --> 00:34:15,908
but this is more than flying off the handle.

598
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:18,377
I'm not going to defend his actions.

599
00:34:18,412 --> 00:34:20,045
But I can't help wondering

600
00:34:20,081 --> 00:34:22,648
if there's not a better solution.

601
00:34:22,683 --> 00:34:24,049
For everyone.

602
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:27,019

[Spits] Jesus. How old is this?

652
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:19,105
I found it in the glove box.

- [Chuckles]
- Best guess?

I got a deal offer from the ADA today.

658

And?

659
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,689
It's not what I expected.

660
00:41:35,724 --> 00:41:37,724
Bad not what you expected?

It's different.

She's offering me Pre-Prosecution Diversion.

664
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:48,902
Seriously?

665
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:51,338
A PPD?

[Chuckles]

667
00:41:52,774 --> 00:41:55,542

00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:58,912
Best I could hope for, right?

670
00:41:58,947 --> 00:42:00,180
Right.

671
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:02,482
What does she want you to confess to?

672
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:04,884
All of it. The felony B and E.

673
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,054
Uh, misdemeanor petty assault
and property damage.

674
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,324
I never touched him,
but they got assault in there.

675
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,926
Well, could be worse.

676
00:42:12,961 --> 00:42:14,928
As long as they never activate it,

677
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:16,763
it doesn't matter, right?

678
00:42:16,798 --> 00:42:20,367
You gonna be able to keep your
nose clean for a whole year?

679
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:23,036
Keep "Viktor" with a "k" on lockdown?

680
00:42:23,071 --> 00:42:25,171
It's not a problem, Giselle.

681
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:27,941
And if I don't, it's instant jail, right?

682
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:29,743
[Exhales deeply]

683
00:42:29,778 --> 00:42:31,177
Lucky break.

684
00:42:31,213 --> 00:42:33,947
She must not want the hassle of a trial.

685
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:37,517
[Clicks tongue] Guess so.

686
00:42:37,552 --> 00:42:39,386
Jimmy...

687
00:42:39,421 --> 00:42:40,954
this is good news.

688
00:42:40,989 --> 00:42:43,590
And Chuck is gonna be pissed.

689
00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:45,592
It's a big check in the "pro" column.

690
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:49,229
Actually, the PPD was Chuck's idea.

691
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:52,065
Shit.

692
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,933
Yeah.

693
00:42:55,237 --> 00:42:57,937
[Breathes deeply] What's his game?

694
00:42:57,973 --> 00:43:01,808
One condition of the PPD
is that my written confession

695
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:05,412
is immediately submitted to
the New Mexico Bar Association.

696
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:07,480
Your written <i>felony</i> confession.

697
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,616
Yeah. I thought he wanted me in jail.

698
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,218
He just wants my law license.

699
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:13,753
[Sighs]

700
00:43:14,823 --> 00:43:16,823
What are you gonna do?

701
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:18,625
Well...

702
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,828
I knew the bar was gonna be an issue, right?

703
00:43:21,863 --> 00:43:23,630
So I figured I'd plea the charges down

704
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:25,432
to a couple misdemeanors, get a censure,

705
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:28,568
and maybe a little suspension, but...

706
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:30,837
a confession to a felony?

707
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:32,739
Grounds for disbarment.

708
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:35,442
Yeah. And if I take it to trial and I lose,

709
00:43:35,477 --> 00:43:38,144
I face the bar anyways
and jail time, most likely.

710
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,412
[Sighs]

711
00:43:39,448 --> 00:43:41,681
He's got me boxed in.

712
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,152
You can fight this.

713
00:43:46,188 --> 00:43:48,621
The disciplinary board listens
to extenuating circumstances.

714
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:51,124
No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.

715
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:52,959
Hell, he made half their careers.

716
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:55,995
It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.

717
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,497
Alone.

718
00:44:00,702 --> 00:44:03,436
- Not alone.
- Kim.

719
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:05,438
Come on, Jimmy.

720
00:44:05,474 --> 00:44:07,107
You need me.

721
00:44:07,142 --> 00:44:09,476
You can't argue this yourself.

722
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:11,044
You and I both know that.

723
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,049
And I'm not gonna let you
fight this on your own.

724
00:44:16,084 --> 00:44:19,119
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

725
00:44:19,154 --> 00:44:21,521
'Cause I don't...

726
00:44:21,556 --> 00:44:23,056
[Sighs]

727
00:44:23,091 --> 00:44:25,325
Why would you...

728
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,626
[Sighs]

729
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:27,994
Come on.

730
00:44:28,029 --> 00:44:29,496
This guy?

731
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:30,897
Seriously?

732
00:44:35,904 --> 00:44:40,507
Let's just call it
the fallacy of sunk costs.

733
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:42,142
[Sighs]

734
00:44:42,177 --> 00:44:43,743
So what now?

735
00:44:43,778 --> 00:44:45,078
Now?

736
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:48,081
Now we, uh, take that PPD,

737
00:44:48,116 --> 00:44:51,284
and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
