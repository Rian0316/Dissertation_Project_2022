1
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:03,879
我已经无人可挡了
I was unstoppable.

2
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:05,241
我是说 我... 我状态太好了
I mean, I was... I was on fire.

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:08,933
就好像我的身心都融为了一体
It was like my mind and my body were totally connected,

4
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:12,569
就像... 像运动员找到感觉的时候一样
like... like athletes must feel when they're in the zone.

5
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:15,931
我再说一遍 不就是迷你高尔夫吗
Again, it was miniature golf.

6
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,489
承认吧 你也玩得挺嗨
Admit it, you're a little turned on.

7
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,520
你不能这么骄傲啊
You can't be this proud.

8
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:21,961
为什么?
Why not?

9
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:25,923
因为我打败你了
Because I beat you.

10
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,720
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hi.

11
00:00:27,722 --> 00:00:29,089
哦 不错 你回来了
Oh, good. You're back.

12
00:00:29,091 --> 00:00:33,527
我们有个激动人心的消息
We have some exciting news.

13
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:35,195
好吧
Okay.

14
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:38,927
你们也知道 Amy和我已经在一起很长时间了
As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time,

15
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:40,757
很多我曾经觉得不可能的事
and a lot of things

16
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,717
现在变得可能了
I never thought possible now seem possible.

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,487
然后呢...
Okay...

18
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,745
我们对我们的关系做了非常仔细的评估
After a careful evaluation of our relationship,

19
00:00:50,747 --> 00:00:55,846
并决定 是时候向前迈一步了
we decided that the time was right to take a step forward.

20
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,733
好吧
Okay.

21
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,664
你想说吗?
Do you want to say it?

22
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:08,735
我们一起说吧
Let's say it together.

23
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:12,035
我们要养一只乌龟!
We're getting a turtle!

24
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:19,063
我就知道我们不能急着庆祝
This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.

25
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:20,189
这是讽刺吗?
Sarcasm?

26
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:21,459
- 是的  - 好的
- Yes.  - Okay.

27
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:23,625
那个有点难懂 因为她谈到酒的时候
That was tricky, 'cause when it comes to alcohol,

28
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:25,991
一般来说都可认真了
she generally means business.

29
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:27,861
呃 我们... 我们为你们感到高兴
Well, we're... we're very happy for you.

30
00:01:27,863 --> 00:01:29,029
是的
Yes.

31
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,294
谢谢
Thank you.

32
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:33,462
一起养一只宠物是我们关系的一大步
Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.

33
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:34,670
是啊 真的
No. It's true.

34
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:37,037
这意味着我们之间多出来的关心
It means that we care so much about each other,

35
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,572
都够分给一只8盎司的爬行动物了
there's enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile.

36
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:41,476
为什么要养乌龟?
Why a turtle?

37
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:45,512
在权衡利弊之后 我们觉得一只乌龟
After much deliberation, we've determined that a turtle

38
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,713
是最理想的宠物
is the ideal pet.

39
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:50,213
他们不会掉毛 不会发出噪音...
They don't shed fur, they don't make noise...

40
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,250
在万圣节的时候 我们可以把他打扮成一块石头
For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone.

41
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:53,252
是啊
Yeah.

42
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:57,216
而且如果他发狂的话 我也能跑得过他
And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him.

43
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:01,917
真巧 我选你做我的室友也是因为这个原因
Coincidentally, that's also why I chose you as a roommate.

44
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:03,084
那恭喜你们
Well, congratulations.

45
00:02:03,086 --> 00:02:05,155
谁能想到 你们两个是我们这群人当中
Who would've thought you two would be the first

46
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,153
- 第一个成家的?  - 嗯
- in our group to start a family?  - Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:10,453
我刚就这么说了!
That's what I said!

48
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:14,092
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

49
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,426
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

50
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,089
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

51
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,593
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

52
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:24,268
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

53
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,935
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

54
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:28,841
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

55
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:29,834

00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,541
呃 你室友今晚去哪了?
So, where's your roommate tonight?

59
00:02:41,543 --> 00:02:43,478
呃 我觉得你每次来她都在
Well, I thought it was a little unfair

60
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,279
然后你一直都没有机会
that she's always here, and you never

61
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:49,218
在我家留宿 所以... 我把她杀了
get a chance to stay over, so... I killed her.

62
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,416
但是你还记得我们之间的约定吗?
But remember our agreement?

63
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:54,090
你可以拿杀人来开玩笑
You can joke about murdering people,

64
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:57,691
但是你一定得说"开玩笑的"
but you have to say, “Just kidding.”

65
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,795
更重要的是要记住
And the more important thing to remember is

66
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:02,236
我永远不会伤害你的
that I'd never hurt you.

67
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,773
好烦
Oh, crap.

68
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:12,781
我得赶到医院去检查一个病人
I have to run over to the hospital and check on a patient.

69
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,246
- 没事的 我等等再来吧  - 别啊
- That's okay. I can come back later.  - No.

70
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:16,486
不用的 别犯傻
No, don't be silly.

71
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,452
我不会离开很久的 你留在这里吧
I won't be gone long. Just stay here.

72
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,651
好的 没事
Okay, cool.

73
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:21,081
对了 你确定我一个人在这里的时候
Oh, and you're sure your roommate's

74
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,720
你的室友不会回来吗?
not gonna come back while I'm here alone, right?

75
00:03:22,722 --> 00:03:24,488
因为那样的话就会比较尴尬了
'Cause that'll be awkward.

76
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,088
哦 别担心 她在棕榈泉
Oh, don't worry. She's in Palm Springs.

77
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,056
哦 那就好
Oh, good.

78
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:29,560
其实是她的躯干在哪里
Well, her torso is.

79
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:32,329
开玩笑的啦
Just kidding.

80
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,528
我把她放在木材削片机里了
I put her in a wood chipper.

81
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,834
哦天啊 哦天啊
Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord.

82
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:42,370
没事的
It's okay.

83
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,378
你成功了 我们没事了
You made it. We're fine.

84
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,944
那里有好多小狗啊
That was a lot of puppies.

85
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,111
忘了它们吧 然后...
Let's forget about them, and...

86
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,911
给我们自己挑一只漂亮的乌龟
pick ourselves out a nice turtle.

87
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,318
是啊 哦 这只趴在木头上的怎么样?
Yeah. Oh, how about this one up on the log?

88
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,086
哦 这个我不太喜欢
Oh, I don't know.

89
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:59,087
他看上去有点混蛋
He kind of looks like a jerk.

90
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,421
那这只怎么样?
How about this one?

91
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:05,955
呃 他都没怎么动 他看上去半死不活的
Well, he's barely moving. He looks half dead.

92
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:08,627
我知道 我也喜欢他
I know. I like him, too.

93
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,360
你好啊 小家伙
Hi, little guy.

94
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:14,834
你想和我们回家吗?
How'd you like to come home with us?

95
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:19,267
你会和我住在一起 因为我们俩是分开住的
You'll be living with me because we don't live in the same house.

96
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,907
但那不是你的错
But that's not your fault.

97
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,214
我们和你一样 (恋情进展)速度非常缓慢
Like you, we're taking it ridiculously slow.

98
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:30,252
当他去漫展 或者出差的时候 你就和我待在一起
You'll stay with me when he's at Comic-Con or away for work.

99
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:35,384
或者如果他们批准了你爹地上火星生活的申请
Or if they accept Daddy's application to live on Mars.

100
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,183
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,855
哦 有一个公司
Oh, there's this company

102
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:41,394
想要在火星上建立一个殖民地
that's attempting to establish a colony on Mars,

103
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:43,965
我申请成为去那边的第一批人
and I applied to be among the first to go.

104
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:45,661
我们给他取个什么名字好呢?
What should we name him?

105
00:04:45,663 --> 00:04:50,373
你知道吗 我进来的时候还想用"Seth" 但...
You know, I came in thinking “Seth,” but...

106
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,003
他有点像是意大利来的
he kind of looks Italian.

107
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:55,305
你去申请加入一个
You applied for a mission

108
00:04:55,307 --> 00:04:57,442
去另一个行星殖民的任务
to be a colonist on another planet,

109
00:04:57,444 --> 00:04:59,674
竟然不告诉我?
and couldn't be bothered to tell me?

110
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:03,112
你会同意吗?
Would you have approved?

111
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:04,449
当然不会
Of course not.

112
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,513
那既然你是这个反应
Well, based on your reaction,

113
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,683
看来我做得对
it looks like I made the right choice.

114
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:11,786
对不对呀 Giuseppe?
Isn't that right, Giuseppe?

115
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:17,900
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

116
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:20,871
听着 我... 我要坦白一件事
Listen, I... I have a little confession to make.

117
00:05:20,873 --> 00:05:23,809
噢 你是第一次吗?
Aw, is this your first time?

118
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,410
不是啊 我给你搞了个情人节礼物
No, I got you something for Valentine's Day,

119
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,587
但我不好意思给你
and I was too embarrassed to give it to you.

120
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:31,955
啊 为什么?
Well, why?

121
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:36,158
呃 因为我是在情趣用品店买的
Well, 'cause I got it at the dirty store.

122
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,359
你去情趣店没叫上我?!
You went to the dirty store without me?!

123
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,933
我戴着墨镜和帽子 还把车子停在了两条街之外
In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.

124
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:46,163
- 啊 快去拿! 拿来给我!  - 确定?
- Well, get it! Get it for me!  - Yeah?

125
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:48,698
- 对啊  - 好吧 呃 我希望它好玩
- Yeah.  - Okay, uh, well, I hope it's fun.

126
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,434
我是说 它... 它上面有颜料 而且... 而且
I mean, it... it comes with paints, and... and

127
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,305
它很有创意 而且很有艺术感
it's kind of creative and artistic.

128
00:05:53,307 --> 00:05:56,875
等等 你是去了情趣用品店还是去了手工艺品店啊?
Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?

129
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:59,515
不是啊
No, no.

130
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,650
我们在在自己身上涂上颜料
We cover ourselves in body paint,

131
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:05,184
然... 然后我们到这块画布上 你懂的
and then... then we get on this big canvas and do our thing.

132
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:07,888
哇 这对于一个最近才同意脱袜子的男人来说
Whoa, that's kind of a big step for a guy

133
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,857
可是向前迈了一大步啊
who only recently agreed to take his socks off.

134
00:06:10,859 --> 00:06:13,285
你在嘲笑我呢 算了吧
You're making fun of me. Forget it.

135
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,254
- 别啊! 别啊 来吧 我想干  - 真的?
- No! No, come on, I want to do it.  - Really?

136
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:17,127
是啊 让你我
Yeah, let's you, me,

137
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,830
还有你那白花花的小脚一起来做艺术吧
and your very, very pale feet make some art.

138
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,663
嘿 你再去那个商店的时候 我也要一起去
Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you.

139
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:27,706
好啊 不过得开好长时间的车呢... 这个我是去圣地亚哥买的
Okay, but it's a drive... the one I went to is in San Diego.

140
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,179
税务怎么样?
How are the taxes going?

141
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,778
还行吧
Okay.

142
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,347
但你有好多乐高的收据
But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.

143
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,221
那些是生意花销
Those are business expenses.

144
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:41,758
你可以把它划掉的
You can write those off.

145
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,463
一个两百刀的R2-D2机器人是工作支出?
A $200 R2-D2 is a business expense?

146
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,533
哦 Bernie	
Oh, Bernie,

147
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:49,596
要是有人来查我们的帐
you're gonna have to sound a lot more confident

148
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:51,468
求你别用这种语气
when we get audited.

149
00:06:55,436 --> 00:06:58,002
喂 怎么了?
Hey, what's up?

150
00:06:58,004 --> 00:07:00,011
额 Emily回医院去了
Eh, Emily ran back to the hospital,

151
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:01,978
所以我现在一个人在她家待着呢
so I'm just hanging out at her place.

152
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,704
你干什么呢?
What are you, uh, what are you doing?

153
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:07,575
Bernie在弄报税的事 我在打游戏
Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.

154
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:10,215
你是小孩吗?
What are you, a little kid?

155
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:13,012
她是不是还会帮你把食物切成小块?
Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?

156
00:07:13,014 --> 00:07:17,583
不用啊... 我自己会吃果冻糖的
She doesn't have to... I filled up on jelly beans.

157
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:20,917
好吧 你在玩...
So, uh, what game are you...

158
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,242
啊
Oh.

159
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:23,912
天啊
Crap.

160
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:24,808
怎么了?
What's wrong?

161
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:27,102
我关不上Emily的床头柜了
I can't get Emily's nightstand to close.

162
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,046
那怎么了?
So?

163
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,109
她会知道我偷偷翻她的床头柜的
She's gonna know I was looking in it.

164
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:32,347
你为什么要翻啊?
Why were you looking in it?

165
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:33,589
这是个好问题
Well, there's a question

166
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,456
我得在她回来之前想个靠谱的答案
I better have a good answer to before she gets back.

167
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,695
淡定点 没事的
Okay, calm down.

168
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:39,191
可能是后面有东西卡住了
There's probably something jammed behind it.

169
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,159
把抽屉拉出来看看里面有什么就好
Just, uh, pull it out and see what's there.

170
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,327
等一下
Hang on.

171
00:07:46,303 --> 00:07:48,933
哦...不是吧
Oh... no. Oh, no.

172
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,468
天啊 怎么会这样!
Oh, God, no!

173
00:07:51,902 --> 00:07:54,140
那个 你那好像不太好... 我先挂了啊
You know what, you sound busy... I'm gonna let you go.

174
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,244
天啊 整个抽屉前面的挡板都掉了
Dude, the whole front came off.

175
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:58,907
现在她肯定会知道我在偷窥她的私人物品了
Now she's gonna know I was snooping.

176
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:00,242
怎么了?
What's happening?

177
00:08:00,244 --> 00:08:03,244
Raj正在偷看Emily的抽屉 还把抽屉弄坏了
Raj was snooping through Emily's drawers and broke one.

178
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:04,579
天啊
Aw.

179
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:07,312
他们分手之后我会想念她的
I'm gonna miss her.

180
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,886
你觉得怎么样?
So what do you think?

181
00:08:10,888 --> 00:08:12,516


182
00:08:12,518 --> 00:08:16,353
我还以为画面能再...至少丰富一点吧
I thought it'd be a little more... just more.

183
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:23,358
真不敢相信我们都快喘不上气了
I'm not even sure why we were out of breath.

184
00:08:25,128 --> 00:08:28,190
额 咱俩... 动了么?
Uh, I mean, d...did we move at all?

185
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,126
可能我们上下动得比较多
Maybe along the z-axis,

186
00:08:30,128 --> 00:08:32,862
平面方向看起来真是悲伤
but x and y are looking pretty sad.

187
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:34,935
不行 不行
Okay, come on.

188
00:08:34,937 --> 00:08:36,638
我们又不是无聊的老头老太太
We are not old boring people.

189
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,966
咱们肯定能玩出更多花样的
We can do better than this.

190
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:38,901
额 这... 有道理
Uh, Th...that's true.

191
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:40,802
咱们昨晚几点睡的?
How late did we stay up last night?

192
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,504
凌晨一点左右吧
Almost 1:00 a.m.

193
00:08:43,506 --> 00:08:46,776
我了个去 一点左右啊
Damn straight, almost 1:00 a.m.

194
00:08:48,578 --> 00:08:49,809
咱们也没看电视
And we weren't even watching TV.

195
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:53,177
咱们看Netflix来着 年轻人都看这个
We were watching Netflix, like the kids do.

196
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:53,177
{\an8}(Netflix是美国在线影片租赁提供商)

197
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,481
是啊 咱们看的是动画片么?
Yeah, is it a comedy?

198
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:55,817
还是剧情片来着?
Is it a drama?

199
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,321
不记得了
Nobody knows.

200
00:08:57,323 --> 00:08:59,122
来来来
Now, come on.

201
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,819
咱们再来一次
We are gonna do this. Yeah.

202
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,723
你准备颜料 我休息个三四十分钟
You get the paint, I'll rest for 30-40 minutes,

203
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,888
然后咱们再来一回合!
and then we do this!

204
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:08,327
真不敢相信 你差点让我
I can't believe you almost had me bring

205
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:11,693
带一只野兽回家
a wild animal into my home.

206
00:09:11,695 --> 00:09:14,459
没人会去戳乌龟的脸
No one told you to poke the turtle's face.

207
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,956
我在和它玩"抓鼻子"的游戏
I was playing "Got Your Nose"

208
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,057
这样才能跟孩子们亲近
That's how you get children to like you.

209
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,959
我真没想到 你一有机会
I'm surprised you even care if he likes you,

210
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:26,527
就打算离开地球了 居然还在乎
since you're planning on leaving the planet

211
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,167
它喜不喜欢你
the first chance you get.

212
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,567
啊 又说起来这个了
Ugh, this again.

213
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,639
Amy 我今天已经受过一次伤了
Amy, I've already had one new hole torn in my body today.

214
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:35,007
别让我再受伤了
I don't need another one.

215
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,241
Sheldon 我知道
Sheldon, I know the odds

216
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,482
你能去火星的几率很小很小
of you even going to Mars are incredibly small,

217
00:09:39,484 --> 00:09:42,549
但是知道你自愿参加 可能会让你永远离开我的事情
but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something 

218
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:44,886
我还是很伤心
that would take you away from me forever.

219
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,222
你是说 你不会为了成为
So you're saying you wouldn't leave me

220
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:49,389
第一个移民到其他星球的人类
for the chance to be one of the first humans

221
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,059
而离开我?
to colonize another planet?

222
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:53,025
我至少会在申请之前
I would at least mention it

223
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,856
告诉你一声
before filling out the application.

224
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:58,160
哈 Leonard Wolowitz Koothrappali
Huh, that's exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali,

225
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,561
Bernadette和Penny都是这么说的
Bernadette and Penny said.

226
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,736
再说了 谁又能保证你们能
And who says you could even survive

227
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,568
在这样的星际旅行中活下来?
an interplanetary mission, anyway?

228
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,904
你连被乌龟咬了一口你都差点死过去
You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite.

229
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,903
首先 这样的伤...
First of all, this...

230
00:10:08,905 --> 00:10:11,608
只会使我变得更加坚强
has only made me stronger.

231
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,608
不过 到现在为止
But beyond that, all I did

232
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,246
我也不过就是填了个申请表而已
was fill out an application.

233
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,245
算了
You know what?

234
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:19,414
Sheldon 去火星吧
Go to Mars, Sheldon.

235
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:24,716
有什么办法能让你开心吗?
Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?

236
00:10:24,718 --> 00:10:26,283
没有 别想了
No. Forget it.

237
00:10:27,357 --> 00:10:29,658
我用鼻子给你吹星际迷航的主题曲怎么样?
What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?

238
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,829
千万别
Please don't. 

239
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,536
好吧 看来你真的生气了
Yep, you're mad.

240
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:50,209
让我看看现在是什么状况
Okay, let me see the damage.

241
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:51,712
稍等一下
Hang on.

242
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,880
我觉得你好象把螺钉弄坏了
Well, I think you broke the dowels.

243
00:10:54,882 --> 00:10:56,312
粘起来的话
You're not gonna have time to glue it

244
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:57,617
肯定是...来不及了 你得把它钉好
back on... you'll have to nail it.

245
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:58,753
用什么啊?
With what?

246
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:01,423
她有没有枕头或者玻璃杯?
Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?

247
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:02,550
有啊
She does.

248
00:11:02,552 --> 00:11:03,589
太好了
Great.

249
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:06,485
这些都没用啊白痴 要用锤子!
Neither of those. Try a hammer!

250
00:11:09,022 --> 00:11:10,523
你喜欢这种感觉?
Did that feel good?

251
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:12,627
好像你最牛似的?
You feel like a big man now?

252
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:18,727
我本来想给你做玫瑰茄茶的
I was going to make you Red Zinger,

253
00:11:18,729 --> 00:11:21,696
不过火星也是红色的
but since Mars is the red planet,

254
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:24,471
我就改做薄荷茶了
I went with peppermint.

255
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,671
你为什么想去火星啊?
Why do you even want to do this?

256
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:30,838
说到这个...
Actually...

257
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,606
作为申请的一部分
as part of the application,

258
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,385
他们让我做一个视频
I was required to make a short video

259
00:11:36,387 --> 00:11:38,819
来回答这个问题
answering that very question.

260
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:40,589
你要看看吗?
You want to see it?

261
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:41,821
你就不能直接告诉我吗?
Can't you just tell me?

262
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:44,029
可是我做了视频呀
But I made a video.

263
00:11:45,863 --> 00:11:48,365
我是Sheldon Copper博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

264
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,603
而我想告诉你们 我为什么应该...
and I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to...

265
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:55,936
去火星!
go to Mars!

266
00:11:57,073 --> 00:11:58,534
我超级聪明
I'm exceedingly smart.

267
00:11:58,536 --> 00:12:00,702
十四岁大学毕业
I graduated college at 14.

268
00:12:00,704 --> 00:12:02,470
我哥哥感染性病的时候
While my brother was getting an STD

269
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,837
我就已经是博士了
I was getting a PhD.

270
00:12:07,015 --> 00:12:10,446
青霉素可治不好高智商呦
Penicillin can't take this away.

271
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:14,254
如果居住空间狭小的话 卫生就会显得非常重要
Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important

272
00:12:14,256 --> 00:12:17,518
而...我的个人卫生无可挑剔
and... my hygiene is impeccable.

273
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,621
事实上 动物们都不喜欢我
In fact, animals don't trust me

274
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,663
因为我闻起来毫无味道
because I smell like nothing.

275
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,632
真的...
Yeah...

276
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:25,835
毫无异味
Literally nothing.

277
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,173
在七个月的太空飞行期间
During the seven-month space flight,

278
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:33,812
我可以用我独特的幽默感鼓舞大家
I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humor.

279
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,687
嘿 Leonard...
Hey, Leonard...

280
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:40,425
盒子里还有花生饼干吗?
is there any peanut brittle left in that can?

281
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,689
这个莫名其妙的盒子?
You mean this weirdly suspicious one?

282
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:46,361
是啊 打开看看吧
Yes. Open it and check.

283
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,998
又是什么意思
I don't get it.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,966
真的有花生饼干在...
There's actually peanut brittle in...

285
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,372
快滚去火星吧
Please go to Mars.

286
00:13:05,341 --> 00:13:07,378
不过言归正传:
But on a more serious note:

287
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,842
我想去火星最重要的原因是
The most important reason I want

288
00:13:08,844 --> 00:13:11,881
我相信 作为一名科学家
to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist,

289
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:14,746
我的使命就是不断推动
it's my duty to push the boundaries

290
00:13:14,748 --> 00:13:17,123
人类知识的发展
of human knowledge forward.

291
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,857
我深知在火星上生存极为困难
Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult.

292
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,022
但生活在地球上也非小菜一碟
But life here on Earth is no picnic.

293
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,523
还有 小菜也非小菜一碟
Also, picnics are no picnic.

294
00:13:26,892 --> 00:13:28,323
我们去哪里吃午饭?
Where should we go for lunch?

295
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:30,596
哦 我知道了 去地底下
Oh, I know, the ground.

296
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:32,888
总而言之
In conclusion,

297
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,455
感谢您考虑让我
thank you for considering me

298
00:13:34,457 --> 00:13:37,327
参与此次"一生之旅"
for this journey of a lifetime.

299
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,897
登上火星!
To Mars!

300
00:13:43,004 --> 00:13:45,643
后来 Leonard擤了下鼻涕
Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose,

301
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,110
结果派喷了出来
and pie came out.

302
00:13:51,084 --> 00:13:53,846
就是那儿 就是那儿
Right there, right there,

303
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:55,677
天哪 就是这样!
Oh, God, that's it!

304
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,608
你眼睛里怎么进颜料的?
How did you get paint in your eye?

305
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,513
都怪你不肯让我戴防护眼镜!
Because you wouldn't let me wear safety goggles!

306
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,024
这活儿看着糟透了
This looks terrible.

307
00:14:10,026 --> 00:14:11,257
她... 她绝对会发现的
She... she's gonna know.

308
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,289
没事的
It's fine.

309
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,890
你只需要再多两个钉子
You just need two more nails.

310
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:14,930
好吧 钉在哪里?
Okay, where should I put them?

311
00:14:14,932 --> 00:14:16,363
Emily的眼睛里
In Emily's eyes.

312
00:14:19,036 --> 00:14:20,330
你只会添乱子
You're not helping.

313
00:14:20,332 --> 00:14:23,033
或许这是你偷窥隐私的报应
Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping.

314
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:24,472
要知道 光... 光是搞定这个就够我烦的了
You know, it... it's bad enough that I have to deal with this...

315
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:26,407
Raj? 我回来啦
Raj? I'm back.

316
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,574
哦 不好
Oh, no.

317
00:14:29,007 --> 00:14:30,708
- 嘿  - 嗨
- Hey.  - Hi.

318
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,078
医院里怎么样?
How was the hospital?

319
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,615
还好啊
Fine.

320
00:14:35,617 --> 00:14:37,280
你在那里做什么呢?
What were you doing in there?

321
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,952
呃... 这... 这个
Uh... w... well...

322
00:14:41,986 --> 00:14:43,319
好吧 听着 我... 我不想骗你
Okay, look, I... I don't want to lie to you.

323
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:45,823
我... 我有点好奇 就四处乱翻...
I... I got curious, I was looking around...

324
00:14:45,825 --> 00:14:48,423
然后弄坏了你床头柜的抽屉
and I broke the drawer on your night stand.

325
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:50,391
你翻了我的床头柜?
You were looking in my night stand?

326
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:51,663
是的
Yeah.

327
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,630
所以第一次留你在我家
So, the first time I leave you alone,

328
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,367
你就偷窥我隐私?
you snoop on me?

329
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,241
你从来没翻查过我的房间吗?
You've never snooped around my apartment?

330
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:01,208
- 没有!  - 拜托啦 好好想想
- No!  - Come on, think back.

331
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,376
要是真有 就帮我大忙了!
It would really help if you had!

332
00:15:04,378 --> 00:15:06,208
真不敢相信你居然不信任我!
I can't believe you don't trust me!

333
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,217
她听起来真的很生气
She sounds really mad.

334
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,250
我们应该挂电话
We should hang up.

335
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,851
是啊 是该挂
Yeah, we should.

336
00:15:12,853 --> 00:15:14,589
但我们不打算这么做 对吧?
But we're not going to, are we?

337
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:17,064
想都别想
Not a chance.

338
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:19,466
那我们不管"偷窥有罪"啦?
What happened to "snooping is wrong"?

339
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,508
Howard 你反正要因偷税坐牢的
Howard, you're going to jail for tax fraud.

340
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,174
谁管这个?
Who cares?

341
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,947
我们做到了
Well, we did it.

342
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,715
我们真做到了
We sure did.

343
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:32,016
我刚才真是干劲十足!
I mean, I was on fire!

344
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:34,309
很... 很在状态 就像个运动员
I... I was in the zone, like an athlete.

345
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:36,872
亲爱的 我在这方面也比你强
Sweetie, I beat you at this, too.

346
00:15:36,874 --> 00:15:39,141
那我们把它挂在哪呢?
So, where do we want to hang it?

347
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:40,277
什么? 你在开玩笑吗?
What? Are you kidding?

348
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,740
我们才不把它挂起来!
We're not hanging it!

349
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,810
不过它是我们爱的描绘啊
But it's an expression of our love.

350
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:46,481
还有我们的屁股! 才不挂它!
And our butts! Not hanging it!

351
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:49,819
那要是丢了它 有点丢人吧
Seems a shame to throw it away.

352
00:15:49,821 --> 00:15:51,556
是啊
Yeah.

353
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:53,895
我们可以把它送给Sheldon
We could give it to Sheldon,

354
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,864
{\an8}威廉·夏特纳: 电影"星际旅行"中饰演舰长詹姆斯

355
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:56,864
说是威廉·夏特纳画的
and tell him William Shatner painted it.

356
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:01,830
天哪 我爱你 我爱死你了
God, I love you. I love you so much.

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,237
我觉得我该回家了
I think I'm gonna go home.

358
00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:09,669
为什么?
Why?

359
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,644
我真没弄明白现在的状况
I really don't understand what's happening here.

360
00:16:12,646 --> 00:16:15,380
要知道 Sheldon 换做平时
You know, Sheldon, at any other time,

361
00:16:15,382 --> 00:16:17,812
得知你计划去火星生活
learning that you had plans to go live on Mars

362
00:16:17,814 --> 00:16:19,547
也没什么大不了的
would be a slow news day.

363
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:21,546
但就在几个小时前
But a couple of hours ago,

364
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,449
我们准备养只乌龟
we were getting a turtle.

365
00:16:23,451 --> 00:16:26,016
听起来可能很傻
And silly as it sounds,

366
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,454
可我还以为那别有意义呢
I thought that meant something.

367
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,085
喂Amy!
Amy!

368
00:16:32,087 --> 00:16:35,058
哦 为什么没给她泡杯宁神茶呢?
Oh, why didn't I give her Sleepy Time tea?

369
00:16:37,322 --> 00:16:38,991
Amy 等等!
Amy, wait!

370
00:16:38,993 --> 00:16:41,494
养只乌龟对我也意义非凡
Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too.

371
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:42,959
当然
Sure.

372
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:44,758
除非你碰上其他更好的事
Unless something better comes along.

373
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,532
你想要我撤回申请吗?
Do you want me to withdraw my application?

374
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:51,228
我想要的是让我们
What I want is for us

375
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,268
一起为未来做打算
to be planning our future together.

376
00:16:56,176 --> 00:16:58,917
那在那个未来里
And in that future,

377
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:00,900
我们生活在同一个星球吗?
are we on the same planet?

378
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:03,278
那是因为我遇到过
Yeah, because I've seen people

379
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,981
有人谈得成异地恋的
make the long-distance thing work.

380
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,916
- 我们生活在一个星球上!  - 好的!
- We're on the same planet!  - Okay!

381
00:17:09,382 --> 00:17:13,018
那个星球一定要是地球吗?
Does that planet have to be Earth?

382
00:17:13,923 --> 00:17:16,488
你是在邀请我陪你一起去火星吗?
Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?

383
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,090
是的
I am.

384
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:19,722
如果我要去一个荒凉的
Yeah, if I'm going to a barren,

385
00:17:19,724 --> 00:17:21,658
没有生命的环境
lifeless environment,

386
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:25,065
在那存活的几率几乎是零
where the chances of survival are slim to none,

387
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:28,460
我希望你也在那陪我
I want you there with me.

388
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,632
我们回房间
Why don't we go back to the apartment,

389
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,430
把你的申请填好吧?
and fill out your application?

390
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,994
好的
Okay.

391
00:17:39,996 --> 00:17:42,832
我在想 成为住在新星球的
I suppose being the first people

392
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:45,133
第一对情侣会是无比的激动人心
on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.

393
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,827
哦 我知道
Oh, I know.

394
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:50,500
我们可以是第一对在火星上插上国旗的情侣
We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars.

395
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:54,267
我们可以是第一对在火星上观看"火星入侵"的情侣
We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars.

396
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:57,043
我们可以是第一对说"天哪
We could be the first to say “Good Lord,

397
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:59,740
你在说什么火星话"的情侣
what on Mars are you talking about"

398
00:17:59,742 --> 00:18:02,043
你要知道
You know,

399
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:04,377
我们也可以是第一对
we could also be the first people

400
00:18:04,379 --> 00:18:07,616
在火星上繁衍后代的情侣
to procreate on Mars.

401
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:11,485
你的宇航服裤就没法好好穿着 是吧?
You just can't keep it in your space pants, can you?

402
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,180
仔细想想
Think about it.

403
00:18:14,182 --> 00:18:15,388
我们要是在那成了家
If we had a family there,

404
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,956
我们的孩子就会是火星人
our kids would be Martians.

405
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:22,557
他们会的 对吧?
They would, wouldn't they?

406
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,429
我们可以给他们起帅气的火星名
We could give them cool Martian names.

407
00:18:25,431 --> 00:18:28,196
我们可以教他们火星历史
And we could teach them about Martian history.

408
00:18:28,198 --> 00:18:30,035
比如 是谁插的那些国旗?
Like, who planted those flags?

409
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:31,531
还有那份"火星入侵"的碟子
And, uh, where did that copy

410
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:34,139
是哪里来的?
of Mars Attacks! come from?

411
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:35,475
我想我们要以夫妻的身份
I guess we'll have to make

412
00:18:35,477 --> 00:18:37,675
一起重新录段视频
a new video together, as a couple.

413
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,843
好主意
Good idea.

414
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,346
而且考虑到你今天这么辛苦
And since you've had such a rough day,

415
00:18:43,348 --> 00:18:46,714
就让你来把派砸Leonard脸上好了
I'm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonard's face.

416
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:58,044
谢谢你原谅了我
Thank you for forgiving me.

417
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,444
没事的
It's okay.

418
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:02,316
某时某刻 我们注定会吵一架的
At some point, we were bound to have our first fight.

419
00:19:02,318 --> 00:19:04,316
上次你说我的苹果派是硬皮的"生面团"时
Well, it almost happened when you called

420
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,556
我就差点想吵架了
my apple pie crust "doughy"

421
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:10,354
事实是你没有错
The truth is you were right.

422
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:13,161
我只是在生自己的气
And I was just angry at myself.

423
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:16,329
我能问你件事吗?
Can I ask you one thing?

424
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:17,696
当然 什么事?
Of course. What?

425
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,295
你翻了我的衣柜吗?
Did you look in my closet?

426
00:19:20,297 --> 00:19:22,631
没有 只是抽屉而已
No. Just the drawer.

427
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:24,335
你保证你没翻过衣柜?
You promise you didn't look in the closet?

428
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,366
我保证
I promise.

429
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:26,766
怎么了 里面有什么吗?
Why, what's in there?

430
00:19:26,768 --> 00:19:28,869
没什么
Don't worry about it.

431
00:19:28,871 --> 00:19:30,174
晚安
Good night.

432
00:19:46,071 --> 00:19:48,174
结尾有特别内容

433
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,174
{\an8}致 伦纳德·尼莫伊 (星际迷航中饰演大副Spock)

434
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:11,174
你给我们的剧和生活带来的影响是永恒的
