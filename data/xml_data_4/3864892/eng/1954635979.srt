1
00:00:00,735 --> 00:00:03,410
Works every... I'm
telling you, every time.

2
00:00:03,411 --> 00:00:05,452
- Do it, try it.
- What? Right now?

3
00:00:05,453 --> 00:00:08,491
All right, all right. (Howls)

4
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:10,518
- Kind of... Kind of that.
- (Chuckles)

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:11,997
- Got to work on it, bro.
- All right, man.

6
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:14,201
- Seriously.
- All right, bro, I'll work on it.

7
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:17,296
But... just, like,
when... when do you know...

8
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:18,759
Right before the cork pops, you know?

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,214
- (Laughs)
- Timing's important, but...

10
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:22,049
But you don't do it, like... in her ear.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,918
- No, you don't do it in her ear.
- Because... yeah.

12
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,804
It's a given you don't do it in her ear.

13
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:28,140
But this is, like,
scientifically proven, okay?

14
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:29,991
- Really?
- This is, like, prehistoric stuff.

15
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,205
- (Laughs) Crazy, man.
- It's like the medulla, the wolf brain.

16
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,613
- The what?
- It's primitive stuff...

17
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:35,108
All right, let me try it again.

18
00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:36,932
- (Howls loudly)
- (Laughs)

19
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,133
Yeah!

20
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:40,685
- Yeah? That's the wolf brain.
- Nice.

21
00:00:40,686 --> 00:00:42,691
(Both laugh)

22
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,663
Man, this town sucks!

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,337
I'm sorry, bro. I know it's
yours and everything, but...

24
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:52,089
- It's not even 2:00.
- Yeah, it does kind of suck.

25
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:55,617
Hey, I know this
after-hours place over...

26
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:58,053
A couple blocks off
Cermak. You want to hit it?

27
00:00:58,054 --> 00:01:01,894
Hells yeah! Let's do it. (Exhales sharply)

28
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:05,288
That's what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,113
Whew!

30
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,605
- (Howls)
- Okay.

31
00:01:11,606 --> 00:01:13,630
(Both howl)

32
00:01:14,197 --> 00:01:16,256
- (Both laugh)
- Not in her ear, right?

33
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:18,638
Not in her ear, not in her ear. Hey...

34
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,158
Bro, I never did catch your name.

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,726
- Saul. (Clears throat)
- Saul?

36
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,766
"S'all good, man."

37
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:26,031
- (Laughs)
- Get it?

38
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:28,669
- I do... All right, Saul.
- (Chuckles)

39
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,350
Hey, hey, brother, whoa.

40
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:33,693
Check it out. What is that?

41
00:01:35,742 --> 00:01:37,572
Holy shit.

42
00:01:38,544 --> 00:01:40,996
There's got to be at least a
thousand bucks in here, man.

43
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,465
Oh, my God, look at that. (Chuckling)

44
00:01:43,466 --> 00:01:45,634
- Whose is it?
- Mine.

45
00:01:45,635 --> 00:01:48,136
Hey, possession's like 4/10ths of the...

46
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:50,138
What did you call it, bro? (Chuckles)

47
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:52,673
- Like, is there an ID or...
- Yeah.

48
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:56,511
I don't know. Some fat guy.

49
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,912
(Chuckles)

50
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:04,770
I'm thinking that one.

51
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:09,130
Phew... Let's...

52
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:25,207
Jesus. Is he, uh...

53
00:02:25,208 --> 00:02:27,209
- What?
- Is he, uh...

54
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,476
I don't know.

55
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,422
- (Grunts)
- Hey.

56
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:48,780
Hey, fella. You all right?

57
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:52,546
(To tune of "Smoke On The
Water") â™ª Uh-huh-huh â™ª

58
00:02:52,952 --> 00:02:55,737
â™ª Uh-huh-huh â™ª

59
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:57,706
- Hey, buddy.
- â™ª Uh-huh-huh â™ª

60
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,291
- Would you answer me?
- (Groans)

61
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:01,866
Hey, answer this, you butthole.

62
00:03:02,212 --> 00:03:04,033
- â™ª Uh-huh-huh â™ª
- What? Butt-hole?

63
00:03:04,034 --> 00:03:05,778
- What the hell?
- Hey, uh...

64
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,599
Hey, bro. Be nice, all right?

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,619
This guy right here is trying to help you.

66
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:13,305
Help yourself to some
of this, you butthole.

67
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,540
Hey, we're not butt-holes, all right?

68
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,476
- So stop saying that.
- â™ª Butt, butthole â™ª

69
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:20,946
â™ª butt, butt, butt-hole â™ª

70
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,548
- Hey, man, what's your problem?
- â™ª butt, butt, butt â™ª

71
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,152
(Slurring) My problem is I'm standing
here talking to a couple butt-holes.

72
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:29,437
Actually, you're not
standing, you fat bastard.

73
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,520
You're laying on your fat ass. (Chuckles)

74
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,575
Hey, I'll roundhouse-kick
you right in your head.

75
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,177
And if you think I won't,

76
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:38,021
I'll come to the McDonald's,
where you work and I'll buy...

77
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:41,066
the whole damn place
and then I'll fire you.

78
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:45,737
I'll say, "drop your mops, you
butt-holes, 'cause you're fired."

79
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:51,410
And then I'll roundhouse-kick
you right in your stupid heads.

80
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:55,847
Then I'll go "John"-Claude
Van Damme on you...

81
00:03:55,848 --> 00:04:00,111
S-s-s... (Snoring)
You butthole.

82
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:03,194
(Snoring)

83
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:04,615
I'm keeping the money.

84
00:04:04,616 --> 00:04:06,885
- (Jimmy chuckles)
- Here you go, fatty.

85
00:04:06,886 --> 00:04:09,693
I got dibs on that watch, man.

86
00:04:11,814 --> 00:04:13,246
Let me see that.

87
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:18,375
What kind is it?

88
00:04:20,923 --> 00:04:23,184
I don't know. It's just a watch.

89
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,227
- We got to get out of here, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

90
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:26,896
- What kind of watch is it?
- (Sighs)

91
00:04:26,897 --> 00:04:31,034
- It's... I don't know. It's...
- Well, then, let me look at it.

92
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:32,279
(Chuckles)

93
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:36,011
- It's a damn Rolex.
- Oh. I don't know.

94
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,422
Not cool to be greedy, bro.

95
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:38,640
- Uh, I didn't know.
- Not cool.

96
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:41,460
I didn't know what...

97
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:42,894
So, how do you want to split this up?

98
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,182
I'll tell you what... you keep the cash.

99
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:48,456
- I'll just keep the watch.
- But it's worth like 3 grand, man.

100
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,195
- $3,000 easy.
- No.

101
00:04:50,196 --> 00:04:51,546
- Yeah.
- (Scoffs)

102
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,547
- Hey, hey, hey.
- (Sighs)

103
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,954
Come on, let's figure this
out. We gotta get out of here.

104
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,769
All right, yeah. You're
right. You know what?

105
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,242
I... sweeten the pot.

106
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:04,252
I got, uh, $5, $20, $40,
$60, $80... 580 bucks.

107
00:05:04,253 --> 00:05:06,661
Add that to the $1,000...
It's more than half.

108
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,069
What do you know about that thing?

109
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,871
I mean, is it worth more than $3,000?

110
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:12,320
No, I don't... I don't
know. But we're good, right?

111
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:13,809
Yeah? We good?

112
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,831
- Okay?
- Well...

113
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:21,621
Later, sucker! (Laughs)

114
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:35,569
(Stevie howling in distance)

115
00:05:37,724 --> 00:05:39,343
("Listen" plays in background)

116
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:42,454
- Jimmy: Six left.
- Can we get more?

117
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:43,788
God, I hope so.

118
00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:45,707
It's like a license to print money.

119
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,375
(Both chuckle) A thing of beauty.

120
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:51,212
Hey, what was that, uh, crazy
stuff about roundhouse kicks?

121
00:05:51,213 --> 00:05:52,547
Where the hell did you get that?

122
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:53,632
I don't know, man.

123
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:54,966
Just something in my brain, you know?

124
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,302
It just came out. Too much?

125
00:05:57,303 --> 00:05:58,803
No. I loved it.

126
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:02,307
It was, like, deep or something.

127
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:03,475
(Scoffs)

128
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,913
You want to talk about
brilliant? I mean we...

129
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,748
You're the man, me... I'm just...

130
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:10,910
I love watching you work, man.

131
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,749
(Water bubbling)

132
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:17,215
It's good for making beer
money. That's about all.

133
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:20,684
- (Inhales deeply)
- <i>â™ª or you can smile â™ª</i>

134
00:06:20,685 --> 00:06:24,092
<i>â™ª That's all right, my friend â™ª</i>

135
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,245
<i>â™ª It could be so... â™ª</i>

136
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:31,800
synced & corrected

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,100

138
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:45,752
Betsy: Please, okay? No one has to know.

139
00:06:45,753 --> 00:06:48,205
I mean, you could just
pretend you didn't find us.

140
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,541
We would never tell
anyone, would we, Craig?

141
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,875
- No, absolutely not.
- No.

142
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:54,211
Jimmy: I already called your lawyer.

143
00:06:54,212 --> 00:06:57,214
(Chuckling) Besides, this
little family outing of yours...

144
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:59,600
It's put an innocent man in jail.

145
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:01,768
The cops are investigating
this as a kidnapping.

146
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:05,105
They already rounded up some poor suspect.

147
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:10,444
A working-class guy. Father... I think.

148
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:14,198
But anyway, you two... you
almost ruined someone's life.

149
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,868
- Potentially several someones.
- I... we had no idea.

150
00:07:17,869 --> 00:07:20,154
Could this have been
the person in the van?

151
00:07:20,931 --> 00:07:25,008
(Gasps) What if the man they arrested
Is the one we were warned about?

152
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,045
Yeah, maybe he's not so innocent, hmm?

153
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:29,746
Warned? Warned how?

154
00:07:29,747 --> 00:07:33,584
Well, we had a phone call.
Someone disguising their voice.

155
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,252
Yeah, they said someone was coming for us.

156
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,254
And there was a van outside the house...

157
00:07:37,255 --> 00:07:39,923
As if whoever was inside was watching us.

158
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:42,259
- Mm-hmm. - And, uh,
once that drove off,

159
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,136
- We... did what we did...
- For the kids.

160
00:07:46,137 --> 00:07:48,615
I wouldn't know about any of that.

161
00:07:48,616 --> 00:07:50,080
I just... (Clears throat)

162
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,320
I can assure you that you
and your family are safe.

163
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:55,188
I mean, the police are
all over this thing, so...

164
00:07:55,189 --> 00:07:57,824
It... it doesn't matter.
Uh, we can't just go back.

165
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:01,912
I mean, it's... our case.
They'll crucify Craig.

166
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:05,032
Can't you just call Ms. Wexler again?

167
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,417
You know, tell her you
didn't see us after all.

168
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:10,387
If they think I ran away, it'll
look like I did something wrong.

169
00:08:10,388 --> 00:08:14,758
We can't risk losing everything
just because of some teensy mistake.

170
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:16,794
- I mean, it's...
- Can I ask you something?

171
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,795
What... what were you hoping would happen?

172
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:21,798
I mean, before I found you,
what were you planning to do?

173
00:08:21,799 --> 00:08:23,017
(Clears throat)

174
00:08:23,018 --> 00:08:26,286
Well, we were in the process
of, you know, working that out...

175
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,172
- We were working that out.
- When you, um...

176
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:29,890
- Yeah.
- (Chuckles)

177
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,097
All right, well, uh...

178
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,343
You still got a little bit
of maneuverability, all right?

179
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:34,978
You... you're outdoorsy, right?

180
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:37,114
So you went on an impromptu camping trip.

181
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:40,194
I don't know. It's something
people do, apparently.

182
00:08:40,195 --> 00:08:44,598
Uh, you left the house a mess, and you
kicked in your own front door because...

183
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:47,605
(Breathes deeply) It's a free country.

184
00:08:47,606 --> 00:08:50,160
Kim Wexler is very good.
She'll make it work.

185
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:52,645
Yeah, what... what about the money?

186
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,920
Uh, well, if she knows about it,
she'll tell, right? She'll have to tell.

187
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:01,374
Well, like they say in Silicon Valley,

188
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,779
"it's not a bug... it's a feature!"

189
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:06,559
Did you ever hear of a bargaining chip?

190
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,567
What we have right here is the
mother of all bargaining chips.

191
00:09:10,568 --> 00:09:15,221
Um, as in... You expect
us to give this back?

192
00:09:17,537 --> 00:09:19,977
We are not giving this back.

193
00:09:20,112 --> 00:09:23,359
Uh, we are not guilty.
This money belongs to us.

194
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,384
We... well, I mean, Craig earned it.

195
00:09:25,385 --> 00:09:26,863
- I worked very hard...
- Yeah.

196
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:30,893
- You know, weekends, holidays...
- Yep, all unpaid, always.

197
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,836
And, really, just because you're salaried,

198
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,621
doesn't mean you don't deserve overtime.

199
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:35,789
I think that's only fair.

200
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,226
I mean, really, that's
what this is about, right?

201
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:39,827
- Fairness.
- Fairness, right.

202
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:41,445
I mean, not just what's legal.

203
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:44,270
If you want to talk
about legal, slavery...

204
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:49,271
That used to be legal.
Human slavery. So...

205
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:52,965
Yeah, this is right up there with that.

206
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:55,080
(Insects chirping)

207
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:58,327
(Children playing)

208
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:05,636
Please, just don't tell
anyone about the money.

209
00:10:06,337 --> 00:10:08,755
- I can't take a bribe.
- Who would know?

210
00:10:08,756 --> 00:10:10,556
- We won't tell anyone.
- Yeah, take it.

211
00:10:10,557 --> 00:10:11,642
I can't take it.

212
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:14,478
Please, didn't you say
that you wanted to help us?

213
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:17,352
So just pretend you never saw
the money. How hard is that?

214
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,063
Take it.

215
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,471
- (Scoffs)
- Take it.

216
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,383
I can't... (Sighs) I can't take a bribe.

217
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,911
But... (clears throat)

218
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:32,008
You know what? I... I can take a retainer.

219
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:33,680
A retainer?

220
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:37,734
Yeah, for my services... as your lawyer?

221
00:10:37,735 --> 00:10:41,321
- You're not our lawyer.
- Well, not yet.

222
00:10:41,322 --> 00:10:45,659
Look... I know that HHM
is shiny and it's slick.

223
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,063
It's chock-full of lawyers and,
compared to them, I'm like a...

224
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:52,933
(Sighs) A kiddy lemonade stand
trying to compete with Wal-Mart.

225
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:55,018
But here's the thing...

226
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,303
What are you gonna get from me

227
00:10:56,304 --> 00:10:58,672
That you're not gonna
get from those other guys?

228
00:10:58,673 --> 00:11:01,675
Passion, commitment.

229
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,261
Ask yourself this... who found you?

230
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,263
- (Chuckles)
- I don't see Howard Hamlin...

231
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:09,330
ruining his $300 Gucci loafers out here.

232
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,802
If you're with me, you're
my number-one client.

233
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,471
Morning, noon, or night,
you call me... I'm there.

234
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:17,807
I would be singularly devoted to you.

235
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,493
(Chuckling) But why not?

236
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:26,628
I'm sorry. You're just...

237
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,592
Just... I'm what?

238
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:35,768
You're the kind of
lawyer guilty people hire.

239
00:11:51,976 --> 00:11:55,178
(Vehicle approaches)

240
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,179
(Brakes squeal)

241
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:00,933
(Buzzer)

242
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:08,525
Did it make the paper?

243
00:12:09,334 --> 00:12:11,745
- What?
- Did it make the paper?

244
00:12:11,746 --> 00:12:13,780
- Did what make the paper?
- (Scoffs)

245
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:16,082
Okay, well, probably missed the deadline,

246
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,201
but check it out tomorrow
morning... front page.

247
00:12:18,202 --> 00:12:20,537
The Kettlemans, all four of them...

248
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,705
Safe and sound.

249
00:12:21,706 --> 00:12:24,758
- Looks like you called it.
- Yeah.

250
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:27,761
Camping... you know, pretty
much right in their own backyard.

251
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:30,396
Well... (Clears throat)
Five miles above it.

252
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:33,800
Jesus, the night I had. I
got pine nuts in my shoes.

253
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:36,498
But, I mean, can you believe it?

254
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,942
I-I guess you can. It's just, you know...

255
00:12:41,943 --> 00:12:46,780
You assume that criminals are
gonna be smarter than they are.

256
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:47,948
I don't know.

257
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:50,950
It kind of breaks my heart a little.

258
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,908
Not the loquacious sort, are you?

259
00:12:57,909 --> 00:13:01,193
We can't all be as blessed as you.

260
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:05,499
- Well, thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

261
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,334
And, uh, if you ever
need any assistance...

262
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:23,433
(Indistinct conversations)
(Telephone rings)

263
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:24,697
(Door opens)

264
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:27,938
Whoa, whoa. Why is my client in handcuffs?

265
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,607
This man is innocent. He's a victim.

266
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:33,326
(Chuckling) why... why on
earth would he be cuffed?

267
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:35,445
Just go... go ahead. Take
them off. There you go.

268
00:13:35,446 --> 00:13:36,446
Free at last!

269
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,582
Hey, did he tell you the good news?

270
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,750
Never even kidnapped... how about that?

271
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:42,786
A family can't go on a little vacation

272
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:44,671
without the whole city going on lockdown?

273
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:47,541
By the way, where is your partner?
What? Did you lose the coin toss?

274
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:50,677
Because we expect an apology
from him, as well as you.

275
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:53,680
You really don't want to push
your luck with me, scumbag.

276
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:57,684
You got eyes on you, asshole.
One little slip... just one.

277
00:13:57,685 --> 00:14:00,353
Yeah, well, you're... you're
both very pretty, so...

278
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:02,442
- (Door opens)
- (Sighs)

279
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,692
(Door closes)

280
00:14:06,003 --> 00:14:07,804
(Sighs) Well... (Clears throat)

281
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,231
I believe I did more
than what you asked of me,

282
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:15,902
so, uh, that would make us square, yes?

283
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:17,954
Great.

284
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,956
You need a ride?

285
00:14:19,957 --> 00:14:22,792
Camping?

286
00:14:22,793 --> 00:14:24,628
You expect me to believe that shit?

287
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,713
(Chuckles) yeah, I know it.

288
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,549
The things people do, huh?

289
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,717
They decide to go camping

290
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,836
Right after I run my little offer by you?

291
00:14:32,837 --> 00:14:37,474
Could be argued that all of
life is one great coincidence.

292
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:41,311
(Indistinct conversation)

293
00:14:41,312 --> 00:14:46,816
Somebody told those
people to, um, go camping.

294
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:50,153
Somebody warned them.

295
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,322
(Clears throat) they're very woodsy.

296
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:54,157
And between you and me,

297
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:56,826
They're pretty rash when it
comes to the decision-making.

298
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:59,663
I mean, they're not really
the plan-ahead types.

299
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:02,332
Yeah, I'd cut the cute
attitude right about now

300
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,833
If I were you.

301
00:15:03,834 --> 00:15:07,836
You ratted on me. There
will be consequences.

302
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,125
Hey, if somebody warned the Kettlemans,

303
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:14,930
it was probably somebody who
was worried about those kids.

304
00:15:19,266 --> 00:15:21,601
You know how much trouble you caused me?

305
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:24,104
You didn't need any help
getting caught, okay?

306
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,773
The neighbor ID'd you. You were sloppy.

307
00:15:26,774 --> 00:15:30,443
Any trouble you might
have... that's on you.

308
00:15:30,444 --> 00:15:33,446
Not to mention the blood in your van.

309
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:37,450
Here's a thought... Ajax, formula 409!

310
00:15:37,451 --> 00:15:40,620
You have no idea the tap-dance
I had to give those cops

311
00:15:40,621 --> 00:15:41,705
To get you out of here.

312
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:45,542
You gave them probable
cause out the wazoo.

313
00:15:45,543 --> 00:15:48,545
Now, and whoever the somebody is

314
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,213
who may have warned the Kettlemans

315
00:15:50,214 --> 00:15:54,166
got them out of there before you
did anything even more stupid.

316
00:15:55,886 --> 00:15:59,689
You should be thanking
this good Samaritan.

317
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,190
Because whoever he is, he did you a favor.

318
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:18,695
("The Battle Hymn of the Republic" plays)

319
00:16:18,696 --> 00:16:20,719
(Insects chirping)

320
00:16:38,713 --> 00:16:41,547
(Sighing)

321
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:04,707
Okay, um, I'm thinking hourly here.

322
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:07,131
There were some special
circumstances, so...

323
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:11,132
(Clicks tongue) Our
elite-tier pricing would be...

324
00:17:11,604 --> 00:17:14,052
$950 an hour.

325
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:17,467
(Calculator clicking)
round it off to 20 hours.

326
00:17:17,468 --> 00:17:18,802
(Clicking continues)

327
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,087
$19,000...

328
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:24,516
Plus $1,000 for travel expenses.

329
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,927
Consulting fees... $1,500.

330
00:17:27,928 --> 00:17:32,732
And, uh, research... Five for filing fees.

331
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:34,760
I ate on the road.

332
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:38,338
And storage fees.

333
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:44,690
(Sighs) Miscellaneous expenses.

334
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,885
(Sighs)

335
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,434
Upon this rock, I will build my church.

336
00:17:58,884 --> 00:18:01,150
Tailor: Double-breasted or single, sir?

337
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:04,019
Single. Now, I want you to
cut the armholes high, okay?

338
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,428
- Of course.
- And trim through the middle.

339
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:08,908
- Trim.
- Cloth?

340
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,927
Uh, oh, well, uh, wool.

341
00:18:11,928 --> 00:18:13,554
- Yeah.
- Uh...

342
00:18:15,882 --> 00:18:19,718
"Super 170 Tasmanian wool."

343
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:22,387
- Beautiful choice, sir.
- Thanks.

344
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:23,555
Uh, navy, all right?

345
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:25,758
- Yeah. -
Uh... Mm-hmm.

346
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,893
Oh, that's it. Perfect. Pinstripe.

347
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:29,895
Shall we discuss shirts?

348
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:33,899
Okay, I'm gonna need your
finest sea island cotton

349
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,235
with a white club collar and french cuffs.

350
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:37,903
I have the very thing.

351
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,239
And I'm assuming you
want to see some ties?

352
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,908
Yeah, I was, you know,
picturing something in a...

353
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,310
- A light-blue
knit. - Mm.

354
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,912
Oh, and, uh, could you make sure

355
00:18:46,913 --> 00:18:50,249
Those are real mother-of-pearl
buttons on the shirts, okay?

356
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,750
None of this fake plastic crap.

357
00:18:51,751 --> 00:18:54,253
Of course. I'll be right back.

358
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,538
Some coffee, David, for the gentleman?

359
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:58,539
(Mid-tempo instrumental music plays)

360
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,125
Tailor: Ah, here we are.

361
00:19:29,755 --> 00:19:33,162
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's go.

362
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,331
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

363
00:19:38,198 --> 00:19:40,631
- (Conversing in Vietnamese)
- So, um, what do you think?

364
00:19:42,468 --> 00:19:45,137
- "Strawberry Fields Forever"?
- Mm.

365
00:19:45,138 --> 00:19:48,807
(Scoffs) No. Are you
crazy? It's not even close.

366
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,893
- Yes, it is. Look.
- No, no.

367
00:19:50,894 --> 00:19:54,096
It's way more "Sassafras Glow". Way more.

368
00:19:54,097 --> 00:19:57,432
Use your eyes...
Strawberry Fields Forever.

369
00:19:57,433 --> 00:20:00,636
Ladies, back me up. Hey.
Is it... Sassafras Glow.

370
00:20:00,637 --> 00:20:02,104
- Am I right?
- Woman: No.

371
00:20:02,105 --> 00:20:05,741
Maybe "Rhapsody in
Blonde," but... Yeah, see?

372
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,242
They agree with me.

373
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:09,411
Whatever happened to "the
customer is always right"?

374
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,747
Sassafras Glow... mix it up, all right?

375
00:20:11,748 --> 00:20:13,081
You're wrong. You'll see.

376
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:14,917
Big deal. I'll wash it out in the morning.

377
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:17,252
- No biggie. Geez.
- It's bleach.

378
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:20,167
- It doesn't wash out.
- What? It's permanent?

379
00:20:20,423 --> 00:20:23,494
(Clicks tongue) We'll
Photoshop the color, okay?

380
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,577
(Sighs) Change of plan, ladies.

381
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:29,181
I want to go with a simple
curling-iron job, okay?

382
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:32,184
Uh, give me, like, ringlets...

383
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:35,687
You know, on top, like
Tony Curtis in "Spartacus."

384
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:38,523
Yeah, like the bath scene in "Spartacus."

385
00:20:38,524 --> 00:20:40,326
(Speaking Vietnamese)

386
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:41,793
- Okay.
- "I am Spartacus."

387
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,464
(Claps hands) Stop talking about it!

388
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:45,697
Make me beautiful, already.
(Talking in Vietnamese)

389
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:47,698
(Engine revs)

390
00:20:50,703 --> 00:20:52,871
(Indistinct conversations in distance)

391
00:20:52,872 --> 00:20:54,872
(Telephones ringing)

392
00:21:03,132 --> 00:21:06,301
(Dialing)

393
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:07,803
(Ringing)

394
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,271
<i>(Click) Jimmy: (British accent) Hello.</i>

395
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:12,641
<i>You've reached the law offices
of James M. McGill, esquire,</i>

396
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,309
<i>A lawyer you can trust.</i>

397
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,979
<i>Kindly leave your information at the tone,</i>

398
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,097
<i>And Mr. McGill will phone you promptly.</i>

399
00:21:19,098 --> 00:21:20,098
<i>(Beep)</i>

400
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:22,601
Hey. Uh... It's me.

401
00:21:22,602 --> 00:21:23,935
(Scoffs) Hi.

402
00:21:23,936 --> 00:21:28,440
Anyway, uh, "The Thing" is
playing downtown on Saturday.

403
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:31,610
Thought you might be up for
some Kurt Russell action.

404
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:34,446
I owe you one, so why don't
we just grab some dinner first?

405
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:36,782
My treat.

406
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:41,953
And... Uh, you know, if not,
can you give me a call anyway?

407
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,288
I really want to talk to you.

408
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:45,090
- Okay. Uh, bye.
- (Knock on door)

409
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:46,525
- (Beep)
- Come in.

410
00:21:46,526 --> 00:21:48,960
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

411
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:51,263
How goes it?

412
00:21:51,264 --> 00:21:54,766
Uh, tricky, for sure.

413
00:21:54,767 --> 00:21:57,769
Craig and Betsy really put us
in a corner with the police.

414
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,104
Not to mention the press.

415
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:02,590
But this camping story of theirs...

416
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:05,019
They've been keeping
it consistent, at least.

417
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:07,010
If it's okay with you,

418
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:10,148
I think I should try to talk
them into hiring a PR firm.

419
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:12,317
Certainly for the next couple of weeks.

420
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:13,797
Mm-hmm.

421
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:17,475
So, okay on the PR firm?

422
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:21,836
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah, of course. What's up?

423
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,879
Take a ride with me.

424
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,715
Uh, okay. Uh... Where are we going?

425
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:48,102
(Engine shuts off)

426
00:22:52,342 --> 00:22:54,162
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

427
00:22:55,376 --> 00:22:56,980
Shit.

428
00:22:57,613 --> 00:22:59,451
Yep. (Sighs)

429
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:05,465
That's... I mean, that's my suit, right?

430
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:08,924
- Am I crazy here?
- No, you're not crazy.

431
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:11,793
Look at the logo. That's our logo.

432
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:14,296
He's just straight-up copying us.

433
00:23:14,297 --> 00:23:17,933
I mean, what the hell
is he thinking with this?

434
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,410
I really... h-h-he's,
you know, a free spirit.

435
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:22,700
(Chuckles)

436
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:25,541
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

437
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:30,948
You two are still friends, right?

438
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:33,181
- I wouldn't exactly...
- You talk, though.

439
00:23:33,182 --> 00:23:34,386
Not really...

440
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,623
Still, you're the one he called

441
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,427
when he found the Kettlemans
camped halfway up the Sandias.

442
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:41,714
He was just looking out for
his own client... that's all.

443
00:23:41,715 --> 00:23:44,576
This isn't the third degree, Kim. I
really don't care one way or the other.

444
00:23:44,577 --> 00:23:47,059
I just... (Sighs)

445
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,177
He's really forcing my hand here.

446
00:23:59,175 --> 00:24:01,808
(Man singing in native language)

447
00:24:03,763 --> 00:24:06,263
(Knock on door)

448
00:24:15,942 --> 00:24:17,609
- (Bell jingles)
- Hey!

449
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

450
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:21,313
- Am I interrupting?
- (Bell jingles)

451
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:24,571
Not at all. Perfect timing. Come on.

452
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:29,871
Sit. Have a massage, free
of charge. (Clicks tongue)

453
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:32,513
- (Chuckles) Okay.
- Got to try the foot bath, too.

454
00:24:32,787 --> 00:24:34,449
Oh, yeah.

455
00:24:34,693 --> 00:24:36,915
Ah, give the old dogs a rest.

456
00:24:36,916 --> 00:24:38,373
(Sighs)

457
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,311
(Sighs)

458
00:24:44,637 --> 00:24:47,037
And go for the deep-tissue
setting. Otherwise...

459
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,675
- Is that the small fist?
- Use the three arrows.

460
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:51,492
- I did. I pressed it.
- Just... yeah.

461
00:24:51,493 --> 00:24:53,510
- (Chair vibrating)
- Now you feel it? Good.

462
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,815
- Ah, now relax, okay?
- Okay.

463
00:24:56,816 --> 00:24:58,619
You deserve a break today.

464
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,917
(Clicks tongue)

465
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:07,526
- It's very nice.
- Told you.

466
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,399
I get this free every night...

467
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,470
Just one of the perks of salon living.

468
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:15,544
The others being... Free
cucumber water, obviously.

469
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:17,966
Obviously. Free mani-pedis?

470
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:20,710
Uh, deep discount mani-pedis.

471
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,641
Because the ladies still
got to eat, you know?

472
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:25,043
- Well, it's still a deal.
- Yeah.

473
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:26,612
(Clicks tongue)

474
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,063
- (Sighs)
- Living like a king, then.

475
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,340
Mm-hmm.

476
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,340
(Sighs)

477
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:42,772
(Clicks tongue)

478
00:25:45,248 --> 00:25:47,850
What's this? Is this a cease and desist?

479
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:49,061
Yeah.

480
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,200
Yeah. How pissed was he?

481
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,484
Well, his head didn't actually explode,

482
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:56,708
but, you know, pretty damn pissed,

483
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:58,917
like "this won't end well for you" pissed.

484
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,193
Yeah.

485
00:26:00,194 --> 00:26:02,444
- How about that?
- Jimmy.

486
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,783
- This is serious.
- I know.

487
00:26:04,784 --> 00:26:06,860
- Do you? I mean...
- Yeah.

488
00:26:06,861 --> 00:26:09,474
What the hell is with that billboard?

489
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:12,975
I know you have a problem
with Hamlin, but I...

490
00:26:13,388 --> 00:26:15,193
I just don't get your angle here.

491
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:18,029
Aren't you trying to build
your own law practice?

492
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:21,866
Instead, you're spending
god knows how much money

493
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,468
turning yourself into
a little Hamlin clone.

494
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:26,871
I mean... Why are you
making this personal?

495
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:29,883
It's not personal? It is so personal.

496
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:33,378
It is completely and totally personal.

497
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:35,213
- No, no, no. It's not. No.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

498
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:38,216
(Sighs) Stop trying to pretend.

499
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:40,552
- I can advertise, can't I?
- (Sighs)

500
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:41,803
What, do I have to clear everything

501
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,054
past the great and powerful Howard?

502
00:26:43,055 --> 00:26:44,889
Yes, you can advertise,
Jimmy, all you want.

503
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,226
That billboard is not advertising.
That is a declaration of war.

504
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:49,561
Declaration of war? That's...

505
00:26:49,562 --> 00:26:52,564
It's right at Hamlin's exit. You
know he drives by it every day.

506
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,899
It's business. I'm building a brand.

507
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,901
You're ripping off a brand.

508
00:26:56,902 --> 00:26:58,153
(Clicks tongue)

509
00:26:58,154 --> 00:26:59,988
- There is nothing original in that ad.
- (Sighs)

510
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:02,991
It certainly doesn't
represent Jimmy McGill.

511
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:05,327
Hey, all right, now, he
fired the first shot, okay?

512
00:27:05,328 --> 00:27:08,853
Trying to keep me from using
my name, my own name, Kim?

513
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:10,989
I get that.

514
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:15,754
But this... You're better than this.

515
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:16,788
- I'm better than this?
- Yeah.

516
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:18,840
- I'm better than this?
- You are.

517
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,259
Well, you're better
than that schmuck Hamlin!

518
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,662
- Oh, come on, Jimmy.
- You could work anywhere.

519
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:26,264
You could be somewhere
where they appreciate you...

520
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:28,117
You know, where they
see how valuable you are,

521
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:30,801
where, I don't know,
maybe they care about you?

522
00:27:41,113 --> 00:27:43,648
Forget it, okay?

523
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,651
If Hamlin wants to come
after me, he knows where I am.

524
00:27:46,652 --> 00:27:48,987
I'll be ready, guns blazing.

525
00:27:48,988 --> 00:27:51,416
- (Papers thud)
- (Sighs)

526
00:27:51,743 --> 00:27:53,009
(Clicks tongue)

527
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:57,378
(Sighs)

528
00:28:02,835 --> 00:28:04,835
(Beep) (Vibrating stops)

529
00:28:08,174 --> 00:28:11,342
The cease and desist
is just the beginning.

530
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:14,846
The next step is an injunction.
You can't win this fight.

531
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:16,181
(Beep)

532
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:18,850
(Chair vibrating)

533
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:20,885
(Sighs)

534
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:36,034
(Lock turns)

535
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:39,037
(Bell jingles)

536
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:40,120
(Door closes)

537
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:46,447
Your honor, I'm a
humble solo practitioner,

538
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:48,433
merely trying to ply my trade

539
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:51,382
In an aggressive and evolving marketplace.

540
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:53,738
As I've argued repeatedly,
this is trademark infringement.

541
00:28:53,739 --> 00:28:57,432
Mr. McGill's new logo is
an absolute copy of ours.

542
00:28:57,684 --> 00:28:59,861
I think it falls firmly under fair use.

543
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:01,195
Fair use?

544
00:29:01,196 --> 00:29:03,031
You're clearly profiting,
so fair use doesn't apply.

545
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,700
It... there are only

546
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,869
Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?

547
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:11,629
No, but we've been using this

548
00:29:11,664 --> 00:29:14,208
and it, in concert with
our tri-rectangle graphic

549
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:18,043
and Hamlindigo Blue, constitutes
a trademarked brand identifier.

550
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:21,332
Whoa, whoa. Back up. Hamlindigo blue?

551
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:24,812
Yes. That is our trademarked name.

552
00:29:24,813 --> 00:29:26,234
(Scoffs) Holy crap.

553
00:29:26,235 --> 00:29:28,973
You seriously named a color "Hamlindigo"?

554
00:29:28,974 --> 00:29:31,309
That is... yikes.

555
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,145
"Yikes"? From the man
dressed exactly like me.

556
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:37,782
Your honor, I feel like I'm in the
mirror routine with Groucho Marx,

557
00:29:37,783 --> 00:29:40,118
Like we should be standing,
waving our arms at each other.

558
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,120
Really? I don't see it.

559
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:44,789
In addition, the name
McGill appears in both logos,

560
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,624
which, I believe, Mr. McGill is hoping

561
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:48,159
to further confuse potential clients.

562
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,394
So I can't advertise
under my own name now?

563
00:29:50,395 --> 00:29:54,832
I'm to be penalized 'cause I happen to
share a name with one of HHM's partners?

564
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:57,001
You can't take my name from me.

565
00:29:57,002 --> 00:29:59,337
The name is not the
problem here, Mr. McGill.

566
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:02,006
Uh, Mr. Hamlin certainly
seems to think so.

567
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:05,343
I mean, he wants me to change
my name 'cause he claims that...

568
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,948
That... what... it's some
kind of threat to his business?

569
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:10,392
- Your honor.
- This is restraint of trade, okay?

570
00:30:10,393 --> 00:30:11,649
Whatever happened to the free market, huh?

571
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:15,510
- No, Hamlin here wants you to tell...
- Okay, okay, I've... enough.

572
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:17,722
Mr. McGill, I've heard enough.

573
00:30:18,397 --> 00:30:20,158
All right, yes, you are within your rights

574
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,993
to advertise using your own name.

575
00:30:21,994 --> 00:30:25,830
However, in my estimation,
the billboard clearly

576
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:28,166
and intentionally duplicates elements

577
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,633
of the Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill logo.

578
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:34,270
You're actively copying their
established brand for your own gain.

579
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:36,330
I don't see any other
reasonable explanation.

580
00:30:36,331 --> 00:30:38,031
- Your honor, I...
- Jimmy, Jimmy.

581
00:30:38,032 --> 00:30:42,825
Wise up. The billboard must
come down within 48 hours.

582
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:47,704
This is a classic David vs. Goliath story.

583
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:50,838
I mean, you got your gigantic law
firm Stomping all over the little guy.

584
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:52,445
Woman: Can you hold the door?

585
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:54,609
Yeah, but it's investigative
journalism at its best.

586
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,712
I-it's right up your alley.

587
00:30:57,744 --> 00:30:58,979
Uh-huh.

588
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:02,900
Yeah, o-okay, well, let me
give you my cell just in case.

589
00:31:02,901 --> 00:31:06,237
Uh... yeah. Thank you.

590
00:31:06,238 --> 00:31:07,572
(Beep)

591
00:31:07,573 --> 00:31:09,240
(Sighs)

592
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:11,074
(Sniffs)

593
00:31:14,129 --> 00:31:16,297
(Beep)

594
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:18,299
Can I get the news desk, please?

595
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,334
I got a hot tip.

596
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:21,836
Don't you want to be the station
that brought down big law?

597
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:23,838
You could be like the reporters
that brought down big tobacco.

598
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,091
Look, I'm talking Woodward
and Bernstein here.

599
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:31,729
Hey, your <i>exposé</i> on predatory
ATM fees... that was... Wow!

600
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,314
Well, it's a miscarriage of justice,

601
00:31:33,315 --> 00:31:36,317
<i>And I think your viewers
would be very, very interested</i>

602
00:31:36,318 --> 00:31:40,488
And, uh, grateful to you
for exposing this injustice.

603
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:43,324
<i>I wouldn't characterize this
as a community health risk,</i>

604
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,193
<i>But it's definitely in
the community interest.</i>

605
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:49,697
No, yes, HHM is a pillar
of the community, yes.

606
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:53,668
No, I... the war is an
important story, as well.

607
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:55,536
That's why this action is so egregious.

608
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:57,622
Sure. Okay.

609
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,423
Well, at least consider the
human-interest angle here.

610
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:01,759
Are you kidding?

611
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,761
It's... lawyer pulls
himself up by his bootstraps,

612
00:32:03,762 --> 00:32:07,548
Only to be ground under the
heel of the old-money megafirm?

613
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:11,719
That's hearts and minds! You... hello?

614
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,770
- (Sighs)
- (Beep)

615
00:32:12,771 --> 00:32:15,389
Yeah, I have your number, too, so...

616
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,774
Yeah, I see.

617
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,582
- Okay.
- (Elevator bell dings)

618
00:32:33,008 --> 00:32:34,683
(Dialing)

619
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:36,945
(Elevator bell dings)

620
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,991
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, man.

621
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:08,192
Can't touch the goods.

622
00:33:08,193 --> 00:33:11,162
I signed the form... only
I can touch the camera.

623
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:13,497
Fine, may I suggest you
widen the frame to include...

624
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,533
The billboard is the story, okay?

625
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:20,121
No, I'm also the story,
so... Got to get me in there.

626
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:21,372
Okay, so, get on your mark.

627
00:33:21,373 --> 00:33:24,208
You know, uh, no offense to
your minutes of experience,

628
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:26,844
But I'd like to see what we
got before we do this, okay?

629
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,581
Other guy.

630
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,542
Other guy!

631
00:33:30,543 --> 00:33:33,434
Only other guy that's here,
go stand where I was standing.

632
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:35,970
Uh... Shrink down. Shrink down.

633
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,939
You know, scrunch. Yeah. (Clicks tongue)

634
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,360
Okay, widen the frame. Get the billboard.

635
00:33:42,361 --> 00:33:44,812
Okay, now get me. Me, me, me, me, me.

636
00:33:44,813 --> 00:33:49,867
No. Not me... get him.
He's me. Yeah, like that.

637
00:33:49,868 --> 00:33:51,652
Got it? Yeah.

638
00:33:51,653 --> 00:33:53,154
Good.

639
00:33:53,155 --> 00:33:56,991
(Sighs) Okay. Is he in the shot?

640
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,659
No. Dude, just go.

641
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,412
- (Sighs) How do I look?
- Great.

642
00:34:01,413 --> 00:34:04,248
I'll, uh... no, this is my good side.

643
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:06,250
(Chuckles, breathes deeply)

644
00:34:06,251 --> 00:34:07,968
Is, uh... is the billboard in? Yes!

645
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:10,971
Jesus, just... you said $100
for one hour, not freaking 3.

646
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:12,840
You clearly have a journalistic impulse.

647
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:14,558
You're a real go-getter, you know that?

648
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,143
Go get this.

649
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:18,679
All right, count me down.

650
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,350
In 5, 4, 3...

651
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,402
Gravitas.

652
00:34:24,403 --> 00:34:29,573
(Breathes deeply) I'm James McGill.

653
00:34:29,574 --> 00:34:32,410
Like most Americans, I'm a self-made man.

654
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:35,079
I put myself through law school.

655
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,581
Working in the courts
as a public defender,

656
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:40,735
I represented those with
nowhere else to turn.

657
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:43,671
I believe in service. It's
what I've built my career on.

658
00:34:43,672 --> 00:34:48,008
But I've also had a dream, a
dream that many of us have...

659
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:52,346
A dream to own my own business.

660
00:34:52,347 --> 00:34:55,349
Well, I-i scrimped and
I saved, and finally,

661
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,217
I was able to buy one billboard...

662
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:03,274
A tiny foray into advertising
for my fledgling law firm.

663
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,443
(Sighs) I've always been told

664
00:35:05,444 --> 00:35:07,278
That America is the land of opportunity,

665
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:11,949
And I believed it...
Until today. (Chuckles)

666
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:15,786
Not 24 hours after my billboard went up,

667
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:17,938
a large law firm came after me.

668
00:35:17,939 --> 00:35:20,241
<i>They said that I was
hurting their business.</i>

669
00:35:20,242 --> 00:35:24,412
They're rich. They're
powerful. I'm just... One man.

670
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,331
So, who do you think
the courts sided with?

671
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:28,833
(Clicks tongue)

672
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:34,004
So now my little billboard comes down.

673
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,339
Let me tell you something...

674
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,675
If they want a fight,
they're gonna get a fight,

675
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:40,227
- Because I'm not giving up, not...
- (Screaming)

676
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:43,063
Holy shit! Dude, the dude!

677
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,815
- (Working guy screaming) Help!
- Dude, the dude!

678
00:35:44,816 --> 00:35:47,401
- The worker guy!
- Holy shit.

679
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:50,134
Please! Aah! Get me down!

680
00:35:50,135 --> 00:35:51,522
- Dude!
- Yeah, okay, call 911!

681
00:35:51,523 --> 00:35:53,374
- Man: Help me! Ah!
- You got a cell?

682
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:56,079
- Yeah, yeah.
- Please!

683
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,919
Yeah, a guy just fell off a billboard
from frontage road south of mountain.

684
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:05,018
Hey, man!

685
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:12,592
(Grunting) Help me!

686
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:20,986
Hey, man, I don't think that's very safe!

687
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,806
You need to be, like, licensed for that!

688
00:36:22,841 --> 00:36:24,722
- Working guy: Help me!
- Man...

689
00:36:24,723 --> 00:36:27,056
(Panting, grunting)

690
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:34,671
Not looking down. One rung at a time.

691
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,483
Not looking down.

692
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,574
(Indistinct conversations)

693
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:45,625
(Man grunting)

694
00:36:49,798 --> 00:36:51,798
(Grunting)

695
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:57,805
Hurry up!

696
00:36:57,806 --> 00:36:59,974
Come get me!

697
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:02,148
Help!

698
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,727
(Grunting)

699
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:09,682
Help me! Aah!

700
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,621
- Sir, I'm right here!
- Please!

701
00:37:16,017 --> 00:37:17,246
Please!

702
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:25,634
- Pull me up!
- Here, grab my hand!

703
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:26,655
Pull me up!

704
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,669
(Both grunting)

705
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,996
- Pull me up!
- Here!

706
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:39,639
- Aah!
- (Both grunting)

707
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:43,883
(Indistinct shouting)

708
00:38:01,736 --> 00:38:05,239
(Both panting)

709
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,304
You okay?

710
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:09,248
Took you long enough.

711
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,472
<i>I was scared, yes.</i>

712
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:24,273
<i>I mean, I'm not really
a big fan of heights...</i>

713
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:25,342
<i>Let me tell you.
(Indistinct conversations)</i>

714
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:29,063
<i>But, you know, something inside
me said, "you have to do this."</i>

715
00:38:29,064 --> 00:38:31,331
<i>I'm sure our city's first responders</i>

716
00:38:31,332 --> 00:38:33,775
<i>would have been here momentarily.</i>

717
00:38:33,776 --> 00:38:36,015
<i>- Can you believe this guy?
- But at least I was able...</i>

718
00:38:36,016 --> 00:38:38,265
This whole thing was a
publicity stunt. It's got to be.

719
00:38:38,266 --> 00:38:40,741
<i>I think that's kind of all anybody
wants when they're in trouble.</i>

720
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:42,009
<i>Of course I didn't think...</i>

721
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:44,160
You don't think anyone's
gonna actually buy this?

722
00:38:45,477 --> 00:38:49,109
It's hard to say. People love a hero.

723
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,367
<i>You take it as it comes, right?</i>

724
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:53,504
<i>The universe put me in
that spot at that moment.</i>

725
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,955
<i>Who am I to say no?</i>

726
00:38:54,956 --> 00:38:58,756
<i>You know, as a lawyer, while
I help people every day...</i>

727
00:38:58,757 --> 00:39:02,169
<i>- Whole thing's a damn stunt.
- But I think my clients know...</i>

728
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,832
<i>that when they're in trouble, I'm there.</i>

729
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:07,233
<i>I was just a guy who was in the right...</i>

730
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,221
(Sighs)

731
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:25,702
(Breathing deeply)

732
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:34,328

733
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:35,379

735
00:39:38,449 --> 00:39:42,319
<i>Female voice: You have seven new messages.</i>

736

737
00:39:44,614 --> 00:39:48,158
<i>To listen to your messages, press "1."</i>

738
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,268
(Beep)

739
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:53,551
<i>First message, received at 5:40...</i>

740
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,401
(Engine shuts off)

741
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:16,696
(Sighs)

742
00:40:21,626 --> 00:40:23,428
_

743
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,678
(Clicks tongue) It's
just showmanship, Chuck.

744
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,680
(Clears throat)

745
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,895
Yeah, right.

746
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,343
(Sighs)

747
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:52,233
(Birds chirping)

748
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,183
You're early.

749
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:12,462
- Did you...
- Yeah, I grounded myself.

750
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:15,970
Hey, big day. My phone's
ringing off the hook.

751
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:19,474
I have three consults
before lunchtime... three.

752
00:41:19,475 --> 00:41:22,160
- That's great, Jimmy.
- Yep.

753
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,713
- The worm has turned.
- (Chuckling)

754
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:27,116
That's really great.

755
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:30,355
So, to what do you
credit this sudden change?

756
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:33,023
Well, I got to admit... you were right.

757
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,306
How so?

758
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:37,760
Well, you told me to keep
plugging and, uh, you know...

759
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,818
do good work, and the clients will come.

760
00:41:39,819 --> 00:41:41,318
You know, I'll admit.

761
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:46,295
I almost lost faith a couple
times, but the worm has turned.

762
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:54,467
So, uh, what... you've been getting
referrals from your PD clients?

763
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:56,296
Uh, yeah. You know...

764
00:41:56,431 --> 00:41:57,973
You work hard, show you got half a brain,

765
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,142
and people come knocking, like you said.

766
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,145
I just needed to get my face out there.

767
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:03,389
Oh.

768
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:06,514
So, prosecutors, then...
referring clients?

769
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:09,673
Yeah. Yep. Exactly.

770
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:11,511
Was it Bergeron?

771
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:14,127
When I was starting out, she
sent me a couple good ones.

772
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,867
Yeah, uh, it was...

773
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,871
It was someone on her team.
(Clicks tongue) You know?

774
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:23,539
I mean, hey, just took some
elbow grease and clean living...

775
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,207
People noticed.

776
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,929
I knew you had it in you.

777
00:42:30,847 --> 00:42:32,883
I don't see the journal here.

778
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:36,765
- Right. Here you go.
- No, no, no.

779
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:38,995
Uh, Albuquerque journal... it's not here.

780
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:43,123
Oh, yeah. (Sighs) I didn't see it outside.

781
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:45,248
Wasn't out there? It's always out there.

782
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:48,126
I didn't see it. (Chuckles)
Maybe they forgot to deliver it.

783
00:42:48,127 --> 00:42:50,552
Maybe some kids grabbed it. (Chuckles)

784
00:42:50,553 --> 00:42:53,567
Because if there's one thing kids
love, it's local print journalism.

785
00:42:53,568 --> 00:42:54,899
(Chuckles) I don't know what to tell you.

786
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,907
You got a ton of reading material there.

787
00:42:56,908 --> 00:43:00,604
Look, hey. (Whistles) Financial Times.

788
00:43:00,605 --> 00:43:04,053
You know, I know Albuquerque
is a hub of global intrigue,

789
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:05,921
but you think that'll tide you over?

790
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:07,579
All right, fine. But if
it's not here tomorrow,

791
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,646
I'm gonna need you to call
the subscription office for me.

792
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:12,047
Yeah, will do. Look, I got to go.

793
00:43:12,082 --> 00:43:15,044
- I don't want to be late.
- Hey, good luck today!

794
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:16,940
- Thanks.
- Keep it up.

795
00:43:17,674 --> 00:43:19,540
Hard work looks good on you.

796
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,561

797
00:43:34,562 --> 00:43:36,729
