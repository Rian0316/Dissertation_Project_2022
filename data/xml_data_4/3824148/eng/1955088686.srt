<i>Previously on "Better Call Saul..."</i>

2
00:00:02,828 --> 00:00:04,549
Why were you working against me?

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,062
You're not a real lawyer!

4
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:10,049
Now that I'm doing the job
alone, I get the full 1500.

5
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,166
I can get more pills.

6
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:13,045
If you're gonna be a
criminal, do your homework.

7
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:15,925
Thanks for not heading
to the Bahamas with this.

8
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:18,311
- What are you doing?
- "The right thing."

9
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,647
Whatever it was, did you
get it out of your system?

10
00:00:20,765 --> 00:00:21,764
Yep, all gone.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,099
The Sandpiper case?

12
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,601
It's getting too big for HHM.

13
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:25,652
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,570
I'm talking about there's
an office in Santa Fe

15
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:28,805
with your name on it.

16
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:53,489
Good night, ladies. Get home safe.

17
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:55,909
See you later, Gene. Good night.

18
00:02:52,934 --> 00:02:55,051
No, no, no, no!

19
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,886
God damn it!

20
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:57,887
No!

21
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,306
Oh, c-come on.

22
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:05,278
Hey! Hey!

23
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:08,948
Somebody!

24
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:01,534
Hey!

25
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:03,453
Hey!

26
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,457
Hey!

00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,301
Ah, here he is.

29
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,335
Oh, great.

30
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:53,587
Jimmy, right on time. Good to see you.

31
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:56,606
Hello, Howard. Hey. Hi.

32
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:58,325
James McGill, Clifford Main.

33
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,627
Just "Jimmy." And it's a
pleasure to meet you, Clifford.

34
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:03,547
Likewise. We know all about
your work on Sandpiper.

35
00:07:03,582 --> 00:07:04,882
Well, it's a group effort.

36
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,550
I mean, the folks at HHM

37
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,385
are just knocking it out of the park.

38
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:10,421
Well, you know, the case
wouldn't exist without you.

39
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,555
Absolutely.

40
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,973
Once you get him on your team,

41
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:14,892
you'll know why I call him "Charlie Hustle."

42
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:16,643
Jimmy, these are my associates...

43
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:19,430
Brian Archuleta and Erin Brill.

44
00:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,231
- Nice to meet you both.
- It's great to meet you.

45
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,733
I hate to do this,

46
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:24,902
but, um, could I borrow
Ms. Wexler for a moment?

47
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,187
If you will excuse us?

48
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,272
Pardon me.

49
00:07:34,113 --> 00:07:35,279
What's going on?

50
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,580
I just, um

51
00:07:36,615 --> 00:07:38,198
Listen, here's the thing.

52
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,252
If I take this job,
does that mean the two of us...

53
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:44,922
I mean, uh...

54
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:46,707
Does it mean, uh...

55
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,176
What? What... What the hell is this?

56
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:52,930
If I take this job today,
with Davis and Main

57
00:07:52,965 --> 00:07:56,633
does that mean that you and me...

58
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:59,887
Is this... Is this gonna happen?

59
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:08,779
Jimmy, I...

60
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:14,651
I...

61
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,657
One thing has absolutely
nothing to do with the other.

62
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,293
Nothing at all.

63
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,728
No.

64
00:08:24,763 --> 00:08:28,131
Of course not. Why would it?

65
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,584
Great.

66
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,520
Uh, sorry about that.

67
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:38,380
Listen, I just want to say
thank you, sincerely,

68
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:39,548
For your interest in me.

69
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,316
It's an honor to be considered,

70
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:43,552
But at this time... At this time...

71
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:47,156
Um, I'm gonna have to take
myself out of the running.

72
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:48,757
Thanks.

73
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:49,925
Thank you, Howard.

74
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,461
Uh, Jimmy?

75
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:58,689
Well, that was quick.

76
00:08:58,742 --> 00:08:59,741
No charge.

77
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:01,409
Help me out here.

78
00:09:01,444 --> 00:09:02,677
Did I dream it,

79
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:08,349
Or did I have $1,600,000 on my desk in cash?

80
00:09:08,385 --> 00:09:10,919
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.

81
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:12,754
We could've split it 50/50.

82
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:16,391
We could've gone home with $800,000... each!

83
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,893
Tax-free!

84
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,361
Your point being?

85
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:22,096
Why didn't we?

86
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:26,067
I remember you saying something
about doing the right thing.

87
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:28,369
You want to know why
I didn't take that money?

88
00:09:28,405 --> 00:09:30,405
Is that what you're asking?

89
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,207
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

90
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,543
Me, personally, I was hired to do a job.

91
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:36,911
I did it.

92
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,613
That's as far as it goes.

93
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,281
Yeah.

94
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:43,117
Well, I know what stopped me.

95
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:44,686
And you know what?

96
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:47,455
It's never stopping me again.

97
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,750
Chao cac co, ladies! Chao cac co!

98
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,652
Mrs. Nguyen, it's a beautiful day out there.

99
00:10:18,687 --> 00:10:20,253
You should get out of
this place once in a while.

100
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,988
You know, throw a frisbee, have some fun.

101
00:10:22,024 --> 00:10:23,590
I have a business to run.

102
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,259
Uh, no. The business is running you.

103
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:29,095
Listen to me. You'll thank me later.

104
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,302
Cucumber water for customer only.

105
00:11:57,786 --> 00:12:00,320
Hey! It's me!

106
00:12:02,057 --> 00:12:05,058
Geez. Hello?

107
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,026
Hello?

108
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,432
It's me. I got a new car.

109
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,380
You like it?

110
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,883
We're not taking that to the meet.

111
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,135
How are we gonna get there?

112
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:21,772
I'll drive.

113
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,973
My car.

114
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,141
Why?

115
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:27,111
This business requires restraint.

116
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:30,898
That is the opposite of restraint.

117
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,317
But... I like it.

118
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:34,652
I mean, I'm proud of it.

119
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:36,320
Good.

120
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,456
Then you be proud of it on your
own time, but not with me.

121
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,157
I'm not getting in that.

122
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:46,163
Okay. Then... then don't.

123
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:50,000
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.

124
00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,003
I've been paying you
the salary of three people

125
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,422
to just stand behind me.

126
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,341
You know? And... And these...
these last few deals...

127
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,927
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.

128
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,679
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men,

129
00:13:01,731 --> 00:13:05,015
then, I mean, why do I need you?

130
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:06,484
I should just go alone.

131
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,519
I'm throwing... I'm throwing away money.

132
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,521
Just tossing it away.

133
00:13:10,573 --> 00:13:12,690
Into the trash.

134
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,825
Look, you do whatever you want,

135
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,278
but I'm advising you...
do not go to that meet

136
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,163
without someone watching your back.

137
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:21,115
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.

138
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,618
I mean, you don't want to be
out of this easy-peasy job.

139
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,838
Well, I'm sorry,
but this is the gravy train,

140
00:13:27,874 --> 00:13:30,374
and it's leaving the station right now.

141
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:34,378
So last chance.

142
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,280
All aboard.

143
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,218
Seriously, last chance.

144
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:45,523
I'm gonna count to, say, 10, and then I'm...

145
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,474
All right, then.

146
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:49,760
Your services are no longer needed!

147
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,239
Hola.

148
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,827
No old guy?

149
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:42,246
What, did he break a hip or something?

150
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,747
I know, right?

151
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,449
Yeah, no, we, uh...

152
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,284
We... we parted ways.

153
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:49,119
Yeah, saw things differently.

154
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,839
So... You know how it is.

155
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,303
This is interesting.

156
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,606
Oh, yeah. You like it?

157
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,808
Can I take a look?

158
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,643
Oh. Be my guest. Get in.

159
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,528
Check it out.

160
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,482
Wow.

161
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,656
Impressive.

162
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,708
Thank you. Get in. Feel the leather.

163
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,662
Yeah, it's a H2.

164
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:33,130
Brand-new off the line.

165
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,500
Slimmer than the H1 but longer, more height.

166
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,002
Yeah, it's a honey.

167
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:43,173
V-8 engine, 325 horsepower,
tri-zone climate controls.

168
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,927
So you can have a girl in
a bikini and another in a parka,

169
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,513
and they're both gonna be comfortable.

170
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:51,849
You're running around
with two girls in your S.U.V.,

171
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:53,651
you'd be really comfortable, huh?

172
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:54,935
Oh, yeah. Yes.

173
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,488
I'm gonna count this quick.

174
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:00,858
Do your thing. Make sure it's right.

175
00:16:12,922 --> 00:16:14,705
Okeydokey.

176
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,875
We are good.

177
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:20,544
Uh, same as before.

178
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:22,746
Uh, still factory-sealed.

179
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,849
And, as always, you're
welcome to count them.

180
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,884
I trust you.

181
00:16:26,886 --> 00:16:29,386
Great. Thank you.

182
00:16:31,273 --> 00:16:33,223
See you next time.

183
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:20,660
Hello?

184
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:22,862
Yes.

185
00:17:22,914 --> 00:17:24,947
Uh, no. Sorry.

186
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,166
But... Yes, this is James McGill,

187
00:17:27,202 --> 00:17:30,036
but I'm no longer a lawyer, so...

188
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,372
That's right... not a lawyer. Bye.

189
00:17:37,262 --> 00:17:39,679
So, this is what
a midlife crisis looks like?

190
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:42,215
Not midlife crisis.

191
00:17:42,267 --> 00:17:43,716
Clarity.

192
00:17:43,718 --> 00:17:45,018
Midlife clarity.

193
00:17:45,053 --> 00:17:47,020
Clarity? Huh.

194
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:48,938
Clearly explain to me why you walked out

195
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:51,391
on the best job opportunity of your life.

196
00:17:53,395 --> 00:17:55,895
Get in the pool, and I'll tell ya.

197
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:57,447
Get in the pool?

198
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:59,916
Yeah. Come on.

199
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,906
Just pop in the gift shop
and buy a bathing suit...

200
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:03,407
get a one-piece, nothing fancy.

201
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,860
The water is perfect. It's 82 degrees.

202
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,278
You can order a drink.

203
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,746
And you got to try this crab dip.

204
00:18:08,781 --> 00:18:10,198
Why are you acting like this?

205
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,083
I'm not acting like anything.

206
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:16,438
I just... finally decided to be me.

207
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:19,164
Everything okay, Mr. Cumpston?
Would you like another drink?

208
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,950
Uh, I'm good with this.

209
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,122
I'll tell you what, Mr. Cumpston.

210
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,458
If you really want to talk,
I'll be in the bar.

211
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,343
Not for long.

212
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,299
Hey, Rolando.

213
00:18:37,301 --> 00:18:40,102
Check.

214
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:44,356
What do... What do you mean "quit the law"?

215
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,642
I quit it. Simple as that.

216
00:18:46,644 --> 00:18:49,194
Oh, well, thanks for explaining, Jimmy.

217
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,280
- It's super-clear now.
- Hey, buddy?

218
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,198
Uh, is that a misprint right there?

219
00:18:53,234 --> 00:18:54,316
It's got to be, right?

220
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:55,701
- The Zafiro Anejo?
- Yeah.

221
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,453
That's correct, actually, believe it or not.

222
00:18:57,488 --> 00:19:00,322
Holy shit. A $50 shot of tequila?

223
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,541
Is it worth it? Apparently.

224
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:04,193
I mean, it's kind of a
personal-choice kind of thing.

225
00:19:04,228 --> 00:19:07,713
Well, I can't die without trying
a $50 shot of tequila,

226
00:19:07,748 --> 00:19:10,466
so, uh... two... dos... neat.

227
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:12,334
And, uh, we can charge that
to the room, can't we?

228
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:15,888
No, we can't. We...

229
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:17,556
I am paying.

230
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,175
And he will be having a shot
of your well brand,

231
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:22,060
and I'll have a glass of your house red.

232
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:25,347
We have a Cabernet, a Pinot, and a Syrah.

233
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:27,683
Whatever. Dealer's choice.

234
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,067
Something with alcohol.

235
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:30,853
You got it.

236
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:38,694
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?

237
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:40,863
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?

238
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,998
Because when I talked to you
about Davis & Main,

239
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,533
you were ready to take the job.

240
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:46,869
Now you're back, and you're
suddenly quitting the law,

241
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:49,037
cheating hotels out of expensive liquor,

242
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,590
wearing a weird pinkie ring?

243
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,709
What, are you in the Mafia now?

244
00:19:55,546 --> 00:19:58,881
Asking if we have a future.

245
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:02,518
I mean, where did that come from?

246
00:20:02,553 --> 00:20:06,054
I don't know. I just...

247
00:20:06,106 --> 00:20:08,557
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.

248
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,192
It's my whole life.

249
00:20:10,227 --> 00:20:14,563
Well, my life since Chuck
made me come to Albuquerque.

250
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:16,031
Ever since I got here,

251
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,567
all I've done is try to make Chuck happy,

252
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:21,236
bend over backwards to please Chuck.

253
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:24,573
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck. Well, no more.

254
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,960
You quitting the law... isn't
that exactly what Chuck wants?

255
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:29,211
Who cares?

256
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,463
This is for me, okay?

257
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:34,216
I-I got into the law
for all the wrong reasons.

258
00:20:34,251 --> 00:20:36,134
I'm trusting my instincts.

259
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,304
I think that my talents
are better spent elsewhere.

260
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,090
Where? Floating in somebody else's pool?

261
00:20:44,428 --> 00:20:46,645
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.

262
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,263
Why give that up?

263
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,599
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments,

264
00:20:50,601 --> 00:20:52,317
but the stuff I liked about it...

265
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:54,269
selling people, convincing people...

266
00:20:54,271 --> 00:20:56,305
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.

267
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,658
Besides, people tell me how they see me,

268
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,276
and it's not as a lawyer.

269
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:04,112
All right. Here you go.

270
00:21:04,164 --> 00:21:05,781
Thank you.

271
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:07,833
Lemme know if I can get
you guys anything else, okay?

272
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:09,785
Bobby, what up, brother man?

273
00:21:09,787 --> 00:21:10,953
Oh, thanks.

274
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,589
Short it.

275
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:14,840
Short it.

276
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,626
Short it. Short that shit.

277
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,511
That stock is useless. It's got no legs.

278
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:21,346
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.

279
00:21:21,382 --> 00:21:22,881
And that one's even worse.
Who's giving you these?

280
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,433
Please do me a favor.

281
00:21:24,468 --> 00:21:26,802
Take a pillow, put it over that stock's face

282
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,553
until you hear the deathbed queef.

283
00:21:28,606 --> 00:21:30,639
- It's a loser.
- Okay, so...

284
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:32,307
if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?

285
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:36,311
Float around and wait for your
Sandpiper money to roll in?

286
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:38,196
No. That could take years.

287
00:21:38,232 --> 00:21:40,399
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.

288
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:42,034
Yeah, it's got legs.

289
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,369
Okay, then, what's the plan?

290
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,321
To be open to the universe.

291
00:21:46,373 --> 00:21:48,206
Okay, so no plan.

292
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:50,959
Just walk the Earth, like Jules
at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?

293
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,512
Look, whatever the universe presents,

294
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,598
whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.

295
00:21:56,634 --> 00:21:58,133
- Whatever opportunity?
- Yeah.

296
00:21:58,135 --> 00:22:00,636
Wasn't Davis & Main an opportunity?

297
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,105
It's a great opportunity,
and you're walking away from it.

298
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,640
Not him, not the guy who...

299
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:09,528
Look, shouldn't you at least try
the job before you say no?

300
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:11,647
And waste everyone's time, including my own?

301
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,316
Kim, I appreciate your concern,
but it's not for me.

302
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:15,901
I don't want it.

303
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:19,154
Jimmy, do you remember how long
you studied for that bar?

304
00:22:19,206 --> 00:22:20,989
How hard you worked?

305
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,875
All that effort, you're
just gonna toss it away?

306
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:25,994
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

307
00:22:25,996 --> 00:22:27,462
W... The what?

308
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:30,716
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost...
It's what gamblers do.

309
00:22:30,751 --> 00:22:32,501
They throw good money after bad

310
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:34,169
thinking they can turn their luck around.

311
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:37,172
It's like, "I've already spent
this much money or time...

312
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:39,307
whatever. I got to keep going!"

313
00:22:39,343 --> 00:22:41,677
No, there's no reward
at the end of this game.

314
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,229
You are making a mistake.

315
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:46,014
I know you're making a mistake.

316
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,350
I've been doing the "right"
thing for all these years now,

317
00:22:48,352 --> 00:22:50,185
and where has it gotten me? Nowhere.

318
00:22:50,237 --> 00:22:51,820
I'm sorry. I don't...

319
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:57,492
It's not my thing.

320
00:22:57,528 --> 00:22:59,027
I don't get it.

321
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:01,363
- I just don't get it.
- It's what's right for me.

322
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:04,499
Donkey balls.

323
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:05,701
Pure donkey balls, dude.

324
00:23:05,703 --> 00:23:07,002
Wall Street's for suckers.

325
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:09,004
Who needs that aggravation?

326
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,089
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live
there, then I sure as hell don't.

327
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,875
I can make a million-dollar
stock trade on my laptop

328
00:23:13,927 --> 00:23:15,377
sitting on a toilet.

329
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,679
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks
on my throne.

330
00:23:17,715 --> 00:23:20,048
That's why Speigelman and Deitch
want my business so bad.

331
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,050
I'm a golden God.

332
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,553
Look, of course I remember that.
Who forgets a thing like that?

333
00:23:24,605 --> 00:23:27,222
That fart had the anger of
a repressed minority community.

334
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,557
You fart like that in someone's face,

335
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:30,025
you're gonna give them pinkeye for life.

336
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:33,445
Good convo, bro.

337
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,397
Till next time, brutha-man.

338
00:23:35,449 --> 00:23:37,232
- Flip side. On it.
- Come with me.

339
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:40,068
- What?
- Just come on. Trust me.

340
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,903
What are you gonna do?

341
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:43,989
You want to understand
what I'm talking about?

342
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,574
Follow my lead.

343
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:58,170
Hey, buddy, could you settle a bet for us?

344
00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,838
- I what?
- Uh, sorry.

345
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,590
I don't want to make it sound
like I was eavesdropping,

346
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,175
but I kind of was.

347
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:05,527
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.

348
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:07,562
Uh-huh.

349
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:09,181
Yeah, so, question...

350
00:24:09,233 --> 00:24:12,601
if you could settle a debate
between me and my sister.

351
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,686
Uh, you know what?
We probably shouldn't be bothering this...

352
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:16,104
We wouldn't normally do this... Right?

353
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,522
but we need an expert.

354
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,407
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.

355
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:22,911
Yeah, go.

356
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:24,446
Okay. Here's the question.

357
00:24:24,448 --> 00:24:26,581
Uh, when it comes to the stock market,

358
00:24:26,617 --> 00:24:28,366
is there, like, a financial limit

359
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:31,703
to how much a person's allowed to invest?

360
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:34,005
A limit?

361
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,124
No. No limit.

362
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,960
Knew it. Oh, even if it's an inheritance?

363
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:41,296
You know, with, like,
inheritance taxes and whatnot?

364
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:42,631
Nope. Same.

365
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,716
That's... Oh, fantastic. Thank you, buddy.

366
00:24:44,768 --> 00:24:48,270
See? No limit. Told you
we could invest it all.

367
00:24:48,305 --> 00:24:50,021
And it's a smart move, too.

368
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:51,473
Sticking it all in the bank? No.

369
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:55,227
Um, yeah. You can... invest all your money.

370
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,862
Just make sure you diversify.

371
00:24:56,897 --> 00:24:59,064
Yeah. Diversify.

372
00:24:59,116 --> 00:25:01,533
That's... You got to...

373
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:02,651
Oh, hey, um...

374
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:04,536
What do you mean, "diversify"?

375
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,454
Well, diversify is...

376
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,906
Y-You know that saying,

377
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,125
"Don't put all your eggs
in one basket," right?

378
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,543
Same principle.

379
00:25:11,578 --> 00:25:13,378
No, it makes complete sense. Thank you.

380
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,963
Now, if I had an idea of the
money we're talking about...

381
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:17,048
Ballpark... I could give you examples

382
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:19,167
of smart diversification.

383
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,804
Yeah, um...

384
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,057
Look, an uncle on our father's
side recently passed,

385
00:25:26,093 --> 00:25:32,347
and he left us somewhere in the
neighborhood of $1.4 million.

386
00:25:32,349 --> 00:25:34,933
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think,

387
00:25:34,985 --> 00:25:38,270
if we invest it smart now,
we could double it, triple it...

388
00:25:38,322 --> 00:25:41,823
we could quadruple
the whole inheritance, right?

389
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:43,942
In my opinion?

390
00:25:43,994 --> 00:25:45,911
Fortune favors the bold, man.

391
00:25:45,946 --> 00:25:48,113
Now, if you guys are free
to join me for a drink,

392
00:25:48,165 --> 00:25:49,414
I can give you a quick consult.

393
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:51,199
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves

394
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,034
through one of those online
brokerage websites.

395
00:25:53,086 --> 00:25:55,954
We're just gonna pick,
uh, a classic, like...

396
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:57,756
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?

397
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,674
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can
totally do it yourself.

398
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,459
Shoot for the tried and true.

399
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,178
'Course, you might be putting
your cash in the Hindenburg,

400
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:06,264
the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."

401
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,766
Right?

402
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:10,552
They all seemed rock-solid
beforehand, but then...

403
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:12,137
Yeah, not good.

404
00:26:12,189 --> 00:26:13,471
Not good, yeah.

405
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:15,056
So, how do you know?

406
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,360
Well, that's where someone
like myself comes in.

407
00:26:18,395 --> 00:26:19,728
Proven track record as a wealth manager.

408
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,530
I take calculated but aggressive risks

409
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:24,532
'cause I want to catch lightning.

410
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,901
And I do.

411
00:26:25,903 --> 00:26:27,319
Practically a money-printing machine.

412
00:26:27,371 --> 00:26:28,536
That sounds good.

413
00:26:28,572 --> 00:26:31,623
A money-printing machine.

414
00:26:31,658 --> 00:26:34,326
Listen, there's a little booth over here.

415
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:37,162
There's some privacy.
We can talk. No obligations.

416
00:26:37,214 --> 00:26:39,414
We can just... just rap
about this a little bit.

417
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,750
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?

418
00:26:41,752 --> 00:26:44,002
What do you say, sis?

419
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:46,554
Can we just talk?

420
00:26:48,842 --> 00:26:50,675
Electric slide on in there.

421
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:52,260
And we'll just rap a little bit. It's no...

422
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:54,012
My name's Ken, by the way.

423
00:26:54,064 --> 00:26:55,764
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."

424
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:57,682
Cool. Viktor with a "K."

425
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:00,769
And this lovely lady is?

426
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:06,241
It's... Giselle. Giselle Saint Claire.

427
00:27:06,276 --> 00:27:07,492
Ah, lovely.

428
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:13,281
Please, sit. I won't bite.

429
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:17,252
So, Viktor with a "K"
and Giselle... exotic names.

430
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:18,536
They're Dutch.

431
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,672
Well, Boer, to be precise.

432
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:23,458
Our... father's side of the
family is from South Africa,

433
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,428
which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.

434
00:27:26,463 --> 00:27:27,796
South Africa.

435
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:29,431
They grow them beautiful down there, right?

436
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:31,599
Charlize Theron. And you.

437
00:27:31,635 --> 00:27:34,352
Oh. Well...

438
00:27:34,388 --> 00:27:37,105
I've never actually been,
but hope to go someday.

439
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,707
Tell you what, by the time
I'm done with you two,

440
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:40,709
you might be taking your own private jet.

441
00:27:40,744 --> 00:27:42,143
Nice.

442
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,396
Excuse me. Hi. Uh, we are sitting here now,

443
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:46,731
so, uh, we could use a wine
list, if you get a chance...

444
00:27:46,783 --> 00:27:48,550
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?

445
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,318
Yes.

446
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,569
You down for that?

447
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:54,990
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?

448
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,958
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.

449
00:27:56,994 --> 00:27:58,493
Three of whatever she just said.

450
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,879
- You got it.
- All right.

451
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:03,331
So, stock market. A great investment.

452
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:05,500
And you're picking
the right time to jump in.

453
00:28:05,535 --> 00:28:07,135
Why do you listen to me? I'm an idiot.

454
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:10,839
And talks about his cars, talks about...

455
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,892
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...

456
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:19,647
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.

457
00:28:19,683 --> 00:28:20,932
Oh, yeah.

458
00:28:20,984 --> 00:28:22,317
Compliments of the bartender.

459
00:28:22,352 --> 00:28:23,685
She thought you might want a souvenir.

460
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:25,820
Oh, my God. Did we drink the entire bottle?

461
00:28:25,856 --> 00:28:26,988
Not yet, we didn't.

462
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:28,490
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.

463
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:30,859
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.

464
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,751
No, really, it's the smart way to go.

465
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:42,120
Okay. But, so, to be clear,

466
00:28:42,172 --> 00:28:45,540
you take the money directly
from our account and invest it.

467
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:47,876
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.

468
00:28:47,878 --> 00:28:50,595
And then all the dividends
and all the profits

469
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,298
and the...what-have-you
comes back into our account.

470
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,600
Boom. Absolutely.

471
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:56,935
And you'll get a detailed statement

472
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,686
showing you how much
your money is growing...

473
00:28:58,722 --> 00:29:00,438
biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.

474
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:04,309
Ken, buddy... let's do this.

475
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,946
Great. Right there, Viktor with a "K,"

476
00:29:07,981 --> 00:29:09,397
and, Giselle, you are next.

477
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,032
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,534
Folks, it's been a pleasure.

479
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:13,952
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.

480
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,988
Wait. What? Ken, you are the greatest.

481
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,490
- Thank you.
- No problem-o.

482
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,874
Hey, this will be the best
decision you'll ever make.

483
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,376
Oh, I believe it.

484
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,911
All right, well,
we should get out of your hair.

485
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,412
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.

486
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:27,048
This... is for you.

487
00:29:27,084 --> 00:29:28,583
Now, that's got all my contact info.

488
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:32,470
Call me anytime with questions
or anything at all.

489
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:33,805
Ken.

490
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,974
Bye. Call me, guys.

491
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:37,642
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.

492
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,930
Wow.

493
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:46,768
Just wow.

494
00:29:58,949 --> 00:30:01,816
Hey.

495
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:03,785
What I...

496
00:30:03,837 --> 00:30:05,420
Is this right?

497
00:30:05,455 --> 00:30:07,956
Yes, sir, it is.

498
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:13,344
Go, go, go, go, go!

499
00:30:15,632 --> 00:30:17,966
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!

500
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:20,135
He's gonna come out.

501
00:30:20,137 --> 00:30:21,636
Oh, no.

502
00:30:21,638 --> 00:30:23,138
I didn't read the fine print.

503
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,473
- Wait.
- Yeah!

504
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,810
Holy crap.

505
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:30,311
I can't b...

506
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:15,295
Can I borrow that when you're done?

507
00:31:15,297 --> 00:31:17,797
No, that's gross.

508
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:19,549
H-how is it gross?

509
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,301
Our germs have already intermingled.

510
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:24,387
It's my toothbrush. It's different.

511
00:31:24,439 --> 00:31:25,889
Why is it different?

512
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:27,807
Because.

513
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:30,026
You know, gums bleed, and there's...

514
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:34,197
there's cold sores,
all sorts of food and weir...

515
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:35,231
Let me see that. Come on.

516
00:31:35,284 --> 00:31:36,483
What? No!

517
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:37,867
Come on! I'll do it right now.

518
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:39,319
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.

519
00:31:39,371 --> 00:31:40,870
I don't have an extra. It's not my problem.

520
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:43,823
That's fine. I got this.

521
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,829
Good. I'm fine with this.

522
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:51,414
Yeah, me too.

523
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:52,916
Wait till you see what I floss with.

524
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:16,239
That's a keeper.

525
00:32:16,274 --> 00:32:19,743
Thank you, Viktor with a "K."

526
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:25,198
Hey, wouldn't it be great
if we could do that every night?

527
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,283
Yes, it would.

528
00:32:29,921 --> 00:32:31,921
But...

529
00:32:31,957 --> 00:32:34,958
We can't.

530
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,043
I know, yeah.

531
00:32:37,045 --> 00:32:41,297
But I'm just saying,
if we could, it would be great.

532
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,466
But I know we can't.

533
00:32:43,518 --> 00:32:46,886
Oh, crap. I can't be late today.

534
00:32:47,689 --> 00:32:49,556
Howard is doling out assignments,

535
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:51,441
and the last one through the door

536
00:32:51,476 --> 00:32:54,728
could get stuck in doc review.

537
00:32:58,749 --> 00:33:00,549
You got somewhere to go?

538
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:04,536
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.

539
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,179
You good?

540
00:33:14,215 --> 00:33:17,349
Yeah. All good.

541
00:33:51,635 --> 00:33:52,718
Daniel Wormald?

542
00:33:52,754 --> 00:33:54,537
I'm Officer Baker. This is Officer Saxton.

543
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:57,623
Yeah, please. Come on in.

544
00:33:57,676 --> 00:34:00,710
Come in. It's over here.

545
00:34:00,762 --> 00:34:02,462
See what they did?

546
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:03,796
I mean, all gone.

547
00:34:03,848 --> 00:34:05,181
All of them, just...

548
00:34:05,216 --> 00:34:06,849
Uh, what's all gone?

549
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:09,936
I have... I had
a baseball-card collection...

550
00:34:09,971 --> 00:34:12,305
a major collection... All stolen.

551
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:14,107
Oh, sorry to hear that.

552
00:34:14,142 --> 00:34:16,392
Uh, was it common knowledge
that you have baseball cards?

553
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:18,277
No, not really.

554
00:34:18,313 --> 00:34:20,980
So, nobody in particular
you can think of wanting them?

555
00:34:21,032 --> 00:34:23,983
No. Not that I... No.

556
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:25,451
How'd they get in?

557
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:28,321
Uh, the back door over here.

558
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:30,123
It was open when I came home for lunch.

559
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:31,708
I mean, it was locked,

560
00:34:31,743 --> 00:34:34,460
but they must have jimmied it
open or something.

561
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:35,795
Uh-huh.

562
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:38,381
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?

563
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:41,551
I left for work at 8:15,
came home for lunch at 12:30,

564
00:34:41,586 --> 00:34:42,719
and called you immediately.

565
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:44,170
Was anything else taken?

566
00:34:44,222 --> 00:34:46,556
Cash... a fair bit. Uh, um...

567
00:34:46,591 --> 00:34:47,924
How much cash?

568
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:49,509
Uh, I don't know.

569
00:34:49,561 --> 00:34:52,645
You know, let's focus on
what's important here, you know?

570
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,098
All I really care about
are my baseball cards.

571
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,767
You know, I have a Topps
Mickey Mantle rookie card

572
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,435
that's irreplaceable.

573
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:02,488
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.

574
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,656
I can go on.

575
00:35:03,691 --> 00:35:05,358
All my cards are in top-loaders,

576
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,161
but if they're taken out
and exposed to the elements,

577
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:10,913
I mean, or creased, God forbid,

578
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,482
I mean, you're looking at
a 9-point downgrade

579
00:35:12,517 --> 00:35:14,717
in a matter of seconds.

580
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:16,536
I understand the first 48 hours

581
00:35:16,588 --> 00:35:19,288
are the most important
in investigations like this,

582
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,007
so the more time passes,

583
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:23,876
I mean, the less likely
we are of a recovery.

584
00:35:23,928 --> 00:35:28,431
So...time is of the essence here, guys.

585
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:30,933
Well, we're gonna help you out
the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

586
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:32,552
Good.

587
00:35:32,604 --> 00:35:35,438
Well...they really tossed this place.

588
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:36,856
I mean, are you sure

589
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:38,891
they weren't looking for anything else?

590
00:35:38,943 --> 00:35:40,476
Like what?

591
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:43,446
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.

592
00:35:43,481 --> 00:35:46,282
I assume more baseball cards.

593
00:35:46,317 --> 00:35:48,918
Did you have more baseball cards than the
ones you keep locked in that case here?

594
00:35:48,953 --> 00:35:50,987
Yes, in... in back... thousands.

595
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,906
But these were the crown jewels over here.

596
00:35:53,958 --> 00:35:55,908
You know, t-the all-star lineup.

597
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,494
Right.

598
00:35:58,496 --> 00:35:59,962
Hmm.

599
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:02,999
What?

600
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:04,550
Just trying to make sense of it.

601
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:06,636
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple

602
00:36:06,671 --> 00:36:09,472
as the perp was looking
for more baseball cards?

603
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,307
Or hopped up on speed or whatever

604
00:36:11,342 --> 00:36:14,060
and went nuts with the vandalism?

605
00:36:14,095 --> 00:36:16,262
Yeah. I mean, that could be.

606
00:36:16,314 --> 00:36:18,598
Yeah.

607
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,266
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.

608
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,684
That yours?

609
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:22,852
Yeah, that's mine.

610
00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:25,188
Uh, it's a lease.

611
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,407
Got a great deal on it.

612
00:36:28,443 --> 00:36:31,494
It's very sweet.

613
00:36:31,529 --> 00:36:33,196
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger

614
00:36:33,198 --> 00:36:34,697
is the reason that Hummers exist.

615
00:36:34,699 --> 00:36:36,999
I don't know how, but that's what they say.

616
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:37,667
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

617
00:36:37,702 --> 00:36:39,752
Huh.

618
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:42,588
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?

619
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,423
Uh, I work I.T.,

620
00:36:44,459 --> 00:36:47,627
uh, for a pharmaceutical company.

621
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:49,679
Wow. Computers.

622
00:36:49,714 --> 00:36:52,014
God, I should've gotten into computers.

623
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,350
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- Yeah, right.

624
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:56,719
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car,

625
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:58,471
but I think we're looking through

626
00:36:58,523 --> 00:37:01,057
the wrong end of the telescope here.

627
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,943
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.

628
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:05,194
Of course.

629
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:07,563
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest

630
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:09,866
of my entire collection

631
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:13,236
and asterisks next to the high-ticket items,

632
00:37:13,238 --> 00:37:15,238
so it's clear which ones they're
gonna try to fence first,

633
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,457
'cause they're super, super valuable.

634
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:21,160
So you're gonna want to get
this list out to pawnshops,

635
00:37:21,212 --> 00:37:24,580
uh, collectors, question anyone who's done

636
00:37:24,582 --> 00:37:26,249
any sort of crime like this in the past.

637
00:37:26,301 --> 00:37:29,218
You know, the... the usual suspects.

638
00:37:29,254 --> 00:37:32,088
Uh, can I get you the list
so you can start investigating?

639
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,173
Yeah, you... Yeah,
if you could get us that list...

640
00:37:34,225 --> 00:37:36,342
Okay, I'll... I'll print it out.

641
00:37:36,394 --> 00:37:40,346
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.

642
00:37:40,398 --> 00:37:42,648
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.

643
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:45,184
Got to breathe. Just keep breathing.

644
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:46,319
Keep breathing.

645
00:37:46,354 --> 00:37:48,521
- Okay.
- I know, right?

646
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:50,406
- Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.

647
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:52,775
- Left the computer.
- Right.

648
00:37:54,913 --> 00:37:56,145
Huh.

649
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,320
There's something wrong with this picture.

650
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:31,340
Hey, it's me.

651
00:39:31,376 --> 00:39:33,709
Another perfect day in paradise out here.

652
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:34,961
I'm in the pool.

653
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:38,214
Okay, call me.

654
00:39:53,898 --> 00:39:56,732
- Hi! How are you?
- Hey, babe. Did you get lunch?

655
00:39:56,734 --> 00:39:58,151
I did.

656
00:39:58,203 --> 00:39:59,986
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.

657
00:40:00,038 --> 00:40:01,788
Oh, really? Well, you're just in luck.

658
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:03,406
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.

659
00:40:07,412 --> 00:40:09,245
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.

660
00:40:09,247 --> 00:40:11,631
Yeah. That feels good, babe.

661
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:15,218
I told you not to spend
so much time in the sun.

662
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:17,970
You don't listen.

663
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,922
Yeah, it's me again.

664
00:40:19,924 --> 00:40:24,060
Listen, as I speak,
not 25 feet away from me,

665
00:40:24,095 --> 00:40:27,313
I'm looking at the mark.

666
00:40:27,348 --> 00:40:31,100
Think Thurston Howell III
if he shacked up with Ginger.

667
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:33,169
He's dripping in Gucci.

668
00:40:33,204 --> 00:40:35,338
It's like I'm at the watering hole,

669
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:38,357
and I'm watching the fattest,
slowest water buffalo

670
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:42,778
expose his neck to me, and
I'm the lioness ready to strike.

671
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,114
Come, Kim.

672
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:49,368
Join me. Join the pride.

673
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,372
Um, I said "lioness"

674
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:56,175
because it's the females
who do all the hunting.

675
00:40:56,211 --> 00:40:59,462
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate,

676
00:40:59,464 --> 00:41:00,963
irrespective of my own sex.

677
00:41:00,965 --> 00:41:03,549
It's a National Geographic thing. Anyway...

678
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:06,219
Get out here.

679
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:07,687
Bye.

680
00:41:50,765 --> 00:41:52,682
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

681
00:41:52,684 --> 00:41:56,852
I need the number
of a law firm... Davis & Main.

682
00:41:56,854 --> 00:42:00,690
Yeah, you can connect me.

683
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,586
Davis & Main.

684
00:43:37,622 --> 00:43:41,340
There are a few options on the company cars.

685
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,426
We can arrange a test-drive
whenever you'd like.

686
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:45,378
Company car... wow.

687
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,047
And there's a service that will
deliver it right to you,

688
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:49,515
wherever you want.

689
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:51,100
And if you find you're not happy with it,

690
00:43:51,135 --> 00:43:53,052
it's not a big deal to change it out.

691
00:43:53,104 --> 00:43:55,354
That sounds really, uh...

692
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,440
Yeah.

693
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,900
This is, uh, interesting.

694
00:44:07,952 --> 00:44:09,318
Oh, if, uh...

695
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,454
If this isn't to your taste,

696
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:13,406
we have a collection of art in-house

697
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,041
you can, uh, choose from.

698
00:44:15,076 --> 00:44:16,059
Anytime you're ready,

699
00:44:16,133 --> 00:44:17,432
I can put together some
samples for you to review.

700
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:20,713
I... I... No, I like this.

701
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:25,384
Good. Uh, well, any other needs
you have, I'm here to help.

702
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,586
Office supplies, dietary needs...

703
00:44:27,638 --> 00:44:30,556
Anything special you want
stocked in the fridge?

704
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,009
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.

705
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:36,896
Omar, I... I'm pretty low-maintenance.

706
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:39,849
Sure. Well, if there's anything you need,

707
00:44:39,851 --> 00:44:41,934
I'm right outside the door.

708
00:44:41,986 --> 00:44:43,986
Great.

709
00:44:44,021 --> 00:44:45,738
If I think of anything.

710
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:48,908
Good.

711
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:51,327
Hey, do you think, um...

712
00:44:51,362 --> 00:44:52,912
I'm just looking at this.

713
00:44:52,947 --> 00:44:55,798
D-Do we get a choice of desks?

714
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:57,366
What were you thinking?

715
00:44:57,368 --> 00:45:02,371
Um... is it possible, um...

716
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:05,758
Can we do... cocobolo?

717
00:45:05,793 --> 00:45:08,427
Cocobolo desk? Absolutely.

718
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,629
I'll get right on that.
