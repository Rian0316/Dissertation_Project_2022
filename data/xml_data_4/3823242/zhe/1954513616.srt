1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,290
我们昨晚在红花餐厅遇见了你妈
Oh, hey, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,090
好吧 她喜欢那地方
Uh, yeah, she loves that place.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,960
每次厨师把虾铲飞起来
Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,430
她就会起身去把它们都夹过来
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,710
所以我从来不带她去海洋世界
That's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.

6
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,380
我知道... 你可能不想知道
I know you... you don't want to hear it,

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,720
但她是和Stuart一起去的
but she was there with Stuart.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,880
没关系
That's fine.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,190
我不在乎
I don't care.

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,220
他们去约会 你就不会觉得不爽吗?
It doesn't bug you when they go out on dates?

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,470
他们没有约会
They're not dating.

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,360
他们只是一起出去吃饭的好朋友
They're just two friends who went out to dinner.

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,230
然后他们会回到共住的房子
And then went back to the home they share

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,360
然后穿着我妈买的
where they probably fell asleep

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,960
情侣睡衣去睡觉
in the matching pajamas she got them

16
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:34,700
就因为他们都喜欢企鹅
because they both just love penguins.

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,820
嘿 很多没在约会的人都喜欢
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,820
穿情侣睡衣
who aren't dating.

19
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,710
- 比如呢?  - 比如你和你的狗
- Like who?  - Like you and your dog.

20
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,040
别排除他们约会的可能性
Don't rule out the dating.

21
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:49,660
好吧 我的确不爽
Fine, it bothers me.

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,580
高兴了?
You happy?

23
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,170
你觉得自己很不爽
You think you've got problems.

24
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,050
长臂猿是猿类家族中唯一没被归为
The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,890
类人猿的
as a great ape.

26
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,840
这也算是安慰?
How is this helpful?

27
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,310
所有非人类的猿类都被归为类人猿
All the non-human apes are classified

28
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,010
就一种不是
as great apes except one.

29
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,270
也就是说分类学家给猿类搞出了一个
That means taxonomists created the entire category

30
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,240
更小的分类 就为了排挤出可怜的长臂猿
of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,990
就像是操场上被排挤的怪小孩
as the weird kid on the playground.

32
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:19,190
所以那个毛毛的小家伙才是真不爽
Now there's a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,160
但长臂猿根本不知道自己被分在哪类
But the gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as.

34
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,660
它也许根本不知道自己叫长臂猿
It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,750
没错
True.

36
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,120
抱歉 孩子 你的情况比长臂猿更糟
Sorry, kid, you've got it worse than a gibbon.

37

* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

嗨
Hi.

49
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,900
嘿
Hey.

50
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,150
我们给电影夜买了点零食
We brought snacks for movie night.

51
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,500
太棒了
Oh, great.

52
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,400
我想你们应该没买餐巾纸 干净的碗
I don't suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls,

53
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,240
刀叉和一卷卫生纸吧
utensils and a roll of toilet paper.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,240
都在这里
Right here.

55
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,290
啊!
Ah!

56
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,670
你们最棒啦
You guys are the best.

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,910
这些衣服怎么回事?
What's with the clothes?

58
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,790
因为我为了工作买了好多新衣服
Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work,

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,400
所以得清理一下衣柜
I needed to make room in my closet.

60
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,000
我是说怎么都折好了?
I meant why are they folded?

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,300
无所谓了
But whatever.

62
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,840
噢 这件是什么?
Ooh, what's this?

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,670
信不信由你 这是我的毕业舞会礼服
That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

64
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,010
你还留着?
Wow, you still have it?

65
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,510
我还以为肯定被揉成一团
I just assumed it was balled up

66
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,960
丢在某个谷仓小角落里了呢
in the corner of a barn somewhere.

67
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,730
你们都觉得我过的是什么日子啊?
What kind of teenager did you think I was?

68
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,650
- 放荡  - 随性
- Slutty.  - Easy.

69
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,860
应该是"受欢迎"
The word is "popular."

70
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,030
你的毕业舞会怎么样? 去了吗?
How was your prom? Did you go?

71
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,530
没有 但我是负责打扫的
No, but I was on clean-up crew.

72
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,160
太遗憾了
Aw, that's sad.

73
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,860
其实没那么糟
No, it was okay.

74
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,370
DJ允许我在他收摊前 和我的拖把
The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop

75
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,790
慢舞了一曲
before he shut down.

76
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,040
所以现在我看到一桶脏水
Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,

77
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,630
还仿佛能听到"Lady in Red"这歌
I still hear "Lady in Red."

78
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,680
我的毕业舞会也糟透了
My prom was pretty terrible, too.

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,010
我很高兴有人邀请我
I was so excited about my date,

80
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,770
但结果他是因为喜欢我朋友
but it turned out he only asked me

81
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,880
才邀请我的
'cause he liked my friend.

82
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,940
他一整晚都在说我的朋友
He spent the whole night talking about her.

83
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,270
我们都懂了 你有朋友 还有舞伴
Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date.

84
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,060
别炫耀了
Stop bragging.

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,640
没关系
Doesn't matter.

86
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,780
毕业舞会很蠢的
Prom is silly anyways.

87
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,390
你说来轻巧 也许你当时的舞伴
Easy for you to say, you probably went

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,860
是足球队的队长呢
with the captain of the football team.

89
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,980
不是
No.

90
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,620
我只不过趁他舞伴去吐的时候
I just made out with him a little

91
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,570
和他亲热了一阵
while his date was puking.

92
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,700
我的舞伴会把呕吐物都擦干净
My date would've had to clean that up.

93
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,710
我有个主意
Ooh, I have an idea.

94
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,660
也许我们可以重温一次毕业舞会
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

95
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,630
肯定会很好玩的
Oh, that would be so much fun.

96
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,500
我们可以装饰一下屋顶 然后让小伙们穿上燕尾服
We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.

97
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,330
我们做个头发 然后跳个慢舞
Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.

98
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,750
两位 相信我
Okay, guys, trust me,

99
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,500
作为已经去过大概七次毕业舞会的人
as someone who's been to, like, seven proms,

100
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,890
那永远不会有你想的那么美好
it is never as good as you want it to be.

101
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,590
你去过七次?
You went to seven proms?

102
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,930
我来数数
Yeah, let's see.

103
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,560
四次"水下世界" 两次"魔法之夜"
Uh, four "Under the Seas," two "Enchanted Evenings,"

104
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,850
还有一次"难忘今宵"
and one "Night to Remember"

105
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,900
那次... 其实我根本没记住是怎样的
that... I cannot remember for the life of me.

106
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,820
嘿
Hey.

107
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,490
- 嘿  - 嘿 Bernadette呢?
- Hey.  - Hey, where's Bernadette?

108
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:10,070
她和Amy去买她们毕业舞会的衣服了
She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.

109
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,910
我收到邀请了
Oh, yeah, I got that Evite.

110
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,750
自从我看过"红粉佳人"后
Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,

111
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,530
就一直很想去参加美国的毕业舞会
I've wanted to go to an American prom.

112
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,370
结果我又看了"魔女嘉莉"
But then I saw Carrie,

113
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,370
{\an8}魔女嘉莉: 一部恐怖片

114
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,170
然后就再也不想参加了
and I did not want to go to an American prom.

115
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,450
不过我又看了"一吻定江山"
But then I saw Never Been Kissed,

116
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,790
就又对舞会感兴趣了
and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

117
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,130
舞会神马的真是难捉摸呢
This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.

118
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,930
Bernie特别兴奋
Bernie's really excited.

119
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,130
我... 我发现 她的声音都变高了
I... I could tell because her voice got so high,

120
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,600
隔壁的小猎犬都被她吓到了
the beagle next door started howling.

121
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,800
你当年参加毕业舞会了吗?
Did you go to your prom?

122
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,640
没
No.

123
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,060
我和"良好教养"约会来着
I had a date with a proper education.

124
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,610
与其穿燕尾服 不如养成良好的习惯
Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits.

125
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,810
我没有喝酒
Instead of spiked punch,

126
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,150
却品尝了知识的美味
I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

127
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,890
我没有在礼堂跳舞
Instead of dancing in a gym,

128
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,410
却随着AP微积分的韵律...
I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms...

129
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,070
好了 别说了
Okay, okay.

130
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,660
摇摆起舞
Of AP Calculus.

131
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,910
你怎么没和Amy还有Bernadette一起去买东西?
How come you're not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?

132
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,720
我猜你觉得这件事特别无聊?
Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?

133
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,170
谁管我是怎么想的? 你觉得呢?
Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?

134
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,250
说实话
Hmm, to be honest,

135
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,310
就算舞会是假的 能和你这样的美女一起参加
it's kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom

136
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,840
也算是美梦成真了
with a woman as beautiful as you.

137
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,510
呃 真是谢谢你
Ugh, thanks a lot.

138
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,380
怎么了?
What?

139
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,430
现在要是我拒绝这件事 就真是个小婊砸了
Well, now I can't blow this thing off without being a bitch.

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,690
听起来像是在说"好啊好啊"!
That sounds like a "yes"!

141
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,030
噢耶 每个人都回复了“参加”
Ooh, every single person RSVP'd "yes."

142
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,860
太开心了!
This is so exciting!

143
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,200
难道不是吗?
Isn't this exciting?

144
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,700
是啊
Yep.

145
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,170
你看 Stuart都带舞伴来呢
Look, even Stuart's bringing a date.

146
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,290
好想知道是谁啊
I wonder who it is.

147
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,210
你明明知道是谁的
You know exactly who it is.

148
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,540
他会带我妈妈过来
He's gonna bring my mom.

149
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,090
你为什么要邀请他啊?
Why did you even invite him?

150
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,850
因为他是我们的朋友 你们俩应该好好相处
Because he's our friend, and you two need to get along.

151
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,210
而且 他为什么不能带你妈妈?
And why can't he take your mom?

152
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,100
你就是带你妈妈去的舞会啊
You took her to your prom.

153
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,970
她不是我的"舞伴" 她是监护人
I didn't "take" her; she was a chaperone.

154
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,060
我看过你俩跳舞的照片
I saw a picture of you two dancing together.

155
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,190
我... 我还能怎么办?
W... What was I gonna do?

156
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,560
他们放了我们的那首曲子!
They were playing our song!

157
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,560
我忍不了了
I can't take this anymore.

158
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
喂
Hello.

159
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,650
Stuart 我们得谈谈
Stuart, we have to talk.

160
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,370
你和我妈妈之间的事 我... 我真的接受不了
This thing with you and my mom, I... I hate it.

161
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,130
我都快疯了
It's making me crazy.

162
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,710
你和我是老朋友了
You and I were friends for years,

163
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,060
可是你现在却要带我妈妈参加我也会出席的舞会?!
and now you're bringing my mother to a party I'm going to?!

164
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,670
这算怎么回事?!
What the hell?!

165
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,250
我才不会带你妈妈去 我有女伴
I'm not bringing your mother, I have a date.

166
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,550
哦 你居然背叛我老妈?
Oh, so now you're cheating on my mother?

167
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,480
哇哦 哇哦 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

168
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,060
你... 你说什么呢?
Wha... What are you talking about?

169
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,060
我和你老妈之间没有发生过任何奇怪的事情
There's nothing weird going on with me and your mother.

170
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,730
Stewie 你的洗澡水快凉了!
Stewie, your bath is getting cold!

171
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,090
我得挂了 拜拜
I got to go, bye.

172
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,710
开门 Penny?
Penny?

173
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,910
开门 penny
Penny.

174
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,160
开门 Penny
Penny.

175
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,530
开门 Penny
Penny.

176
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,200
开门 Penny
Penny.

177
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,500
你敲门的次数比平时多了
You knocked more than usual.

178
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,830
说不定下次我会着急
Next time I might be in a rush,

179
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,290
这次多敲几下先存着
it's good to have a few in the bank.

180
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,120
好吧 怎么了?
Okay, what's up?

181
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,510
我想和你谈谈Amy和Bernadette
I'd like to discuss this party

182
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,020
举办的舞会
that Amy and Bernadette are throwing.

183
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,260
既然你和我都不太想去
Since you and I are both reluctant to go,

184
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,750
我有一个办法能让我们尽情享受它
I think I've come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it.

185
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,130
棒啊 什么办法?
Great, how?

186
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,170
我们装作外星人
We pretend we're aliens.

187
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,220
我不太擅长理解人的表情
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

188
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,890
不过我猜你很感兴趣 而且还想进一步了解我的主意
but I'm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more.

189
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,730
是这样的 在广受欢迎的小说
Now, in the beloved novel

190
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,560
银河系漫游指南中
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

191
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,980
有一个叫做Ford Perfect的外星人假装成人类
an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human

192
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,370
混入人群 这样他就可以在银河系漫游指南中
in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth

193
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,460
写一部关于地球的作品
for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

194
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,990
那是一部书中提及的游记
which is a travel book within the actual book,

195
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,330
书名也叫
which is also called

196
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,000
"银河系漫游指南"
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,870
好吧 我只有一个问题
Okay, just one question.

198
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,000
你在说啥?
What?

199
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,420
重点在于 假装成外星人
My point is, pretending to be an alien is

200
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,720
是我最有用的应对机制 我用过好几次了
a valuable coping mechanism I've used many times.

201
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,680
第一次是去看你的表演的时候
I did it the first time I went to see you in a play.

202
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,060
你一定不知道来自鲸鱼座阿尔法恒星三号的
You had no idea Commander Umfrumf

203
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,100
Umfrumf指挥官就坐在观众席上
of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience.

204
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,020
哦 别担心 我给你竖了七根大拇指呢
Oh, d... don't worry, he gave you seven thumbs up.

205
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,990
问题在于...
Here's a question...

206
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,190
作为一个假装成人类的外星人 你有没有准备
as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning

207
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,830
在舞会结束之后和Amy进行特定的一些交配仪式?
to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?

208
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,840
还有交配仪式?
There are post-prom mating rituals?

209
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,160
也不总是有
Not always.

210
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,310
除非你的舞伴开的是有气垫的货车
Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress,

211
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,040
一般都是有的
then always.

212
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,220
好吧 如果这是舞会的一部分的话 我可以接受
Well, if it's part of the prom experience, then I'm open to it.

213
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,020
你开什么玩笑
You're kidding.

214
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,750
就算是外星人 我也是有欲望的啊
I may be an alien, but I have urges.

215
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,980
如果Amy交配的时候想把卵子射入太空
If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space,

216
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,730
那我很愿意用
well, then, I will happily catch them

217
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,680
我上生殖器的可再生囊去接住它
with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin.

218
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,400
我不太擅长理解人的表情
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,

219
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,990
不过我能看出来你有点感性趣了
but I can see that you're a little turned on.

220
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,910
知道吗 如果你不打算学着自己系领结的话
You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this,

221
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,630
也可以用那种有夹子的领结
they make some pretty good clip-ons.

222
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,050
蝙蝠侠才不会戴那种领结
Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.

223
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,420
蝙蝠侠可不会叫他的室友帮他打领结
Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.

224
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,090
他室友是Alfred 而且 没错 他的确帮蝙蝠侠打领结
His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.

225
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
打好了 很完美
There, perfect.

226
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,060
是吗 你确定?
What, are you sure?

227
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,600
这是我第一次参加舞会 我可不想弄错什么
It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.

228
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,840
我以为你要假扮成外星人
I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.

229
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,320
我是想这么做 但是Penny不想
I was, but Penny didn't want to.

230
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,910
你也不想
You didn't want to.

231
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,780
Bernadette Amy Koothrappali Wolowitz都不想
Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didn't want to.

232
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,830
连我都知道雇个人来还是很诡异的 
And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.

233
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,620
那是个酒罐吗?
Was that a flask?

234
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,090
没错
Yes.

235
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,120
我打算接纳所有关于舞会的传统习俗
I've decided to embrace all of the traditions

236
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,790
包括偷偷往大碗里掺酒
associated with prom, including spiking the punch.

237
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,430
你要去掺酒?
You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?

238
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,130
哦 不 这只是石榴汁
Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.

239
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,550
这就像是高中时捣鬼作怪 只不过是用
It's all the fun of high school high jinks

240
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,640
石榴汁代替大量的抗氧化剂
with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants.

241
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,530
如果你把牛仔裤和皮衣扯烂后再穿
If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket,

242
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:21,150
你大概就是迪士尼频道最霸气的家伙了
you'd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel.

243
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,980
那么 今晚还有什么别的打算吗?
So, anything else planned for tonight?

244
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,740
噢 什么都想干
Oh, everything.

245
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,370
拍拍照片 跳跳慢舞
Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing,

246
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,620
当选舞会国王
being elected prom king.

247
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,660
向大家指明国王不是选举产生的
Pointing out that kings aren't elected.

248
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,720
这样应该就能脱身了
It's gonna be off the hook.

249
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,340
当你在舞会上
And while you're at it,

250
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,720
我知道你这个年龄 你的荷尔蒙会飙升
I know that at this age your hormones are raging,

251
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,670
但是不要因为你的所有朋友们都在和别人上床
but just because all your friends are having sex

252
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,810
你就也跟着这么做
doesn't mean you have to.

253
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,840
你这么说是为什么?
Why would you say that?

254
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:56,180
你懂的 因为...
You know, 'cause...

255
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,400
因为很多人是在舞会之夜破的处
'cause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.

256
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,420
Penny也这么暗示了
Penny implied the same thing.

257
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,550
这是真的吗?
Is this true?

258
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,520
放松一下 开个玩笑而已
Just relax, it's a joke.

259
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,190
你又没有荷尔蒙
You don't have hormones.

260
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,800
哇 你太漂亮了
Wow, you look amazing.

261
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,330
谢谢 你也是
Thank you, so do you.

262
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,300
Sheldon 你看起来好帅
Sheldon, you look so handsome.

263
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,420
谢谢你
Thank you.

264
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,890
Amy不美吗 Sheldon?
Sheldon, doesn't Amy look hot?

265
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,840
这可是会让上生殖器硬起来
That's got to put some starch in the upper flermin.

266
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,100
那是什么?
What's that?

267
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,900
噢 那是个长在他两侧肩胛骨中间的
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ

268
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,650
鳞状生殖器
that grows between his shoulder blades.

269
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,520
跳舞的时候尽量别碰到它
Try not to touch it when you're dancing.

270
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,820
抱歉
Excuse me.

271
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,160
你要去哪里?
Where are you going?

272
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,440
我做不到
I can't do this.

273
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,030
而且告诉你 Leonard
And for your information, Leonard,

274
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,830
上生殖器不长在我的肩胛骨中央
the upper flermin doesn't grow between my shoulder blades,

275
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:54,950
它长在我脖子上的肚脐眼里
it grows out of the belly button on my neck.

276
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:01,870
他说得没错 我想的是下生殖器
He's right, I was thinking of the lower flermin.

277
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,880
喔 我要 呃 我要发短信给Stuart 告诉他我们快到了
Ooh, I'll, uh, text Stuart, let him know we're close.

278
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,550
好漂亮的纹身
That's a neat tattoo.

279
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,930
哦 谢谢 这是圣诞夜惊魂里的Sally
Oh, thanks, it's Sally from Nightmare before Christmas.

280
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,130
嗷 那部电影好萌的
Aw, that movie's so cute.

281
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,270
你喜欢她是因为你们俩头发都是红色的吗?
Do you like her because you both have red hair?

282
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,020
呃 有那么一点吧 不过主要是因为她浑身都是伤疤
Uh, a little, but more that she's covered in scars

283
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,860
而且她还可以把自己的四肢拆下来再缝回去
and can pull her own limbs off and sew them back on.

284
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,650
我喜欢灰姑娘
I like Cinderella.

285
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,730
你知道在原著里
Did you know, in the original book,

286
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,790
她的姐姐们为了能穿进玻璃鞋
the sisters cut off their toes with knives

287
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,570
把自己的脚趾头都割下来了?
in order to fit in the glass slipper?

288
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,710
我喜欢"Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo"
I like "Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."

289
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,710
{\an8}Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo: 电影仙履奇缘2中的插曲

290
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,240
嘿 Stuart和他的女伴来了
Hey, here comes Stuart and his date.

291
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,250
噢 她真漂亮
Oh, she's cute.

292
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,250
天啊
Oh, my God.

293
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,330
怎么了?
What?

294
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,300
那是Jeanie
That's Jeanie.

295
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,390
那就是Jeanie?!
That's Jeanie?!

296
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,140
- 谁是Jeanie?  - 别说出来
- Who's Jeanie?  - Don't say it.

297
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,060
那是Howard上过的表妹
That's Howard's cousin that he had sex with.

298
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,560
她是我的第二代堂表妹
She is my second cousin.

299
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,150
我们才15岁... 我刚说了"别说出来"
We were 15... I just said, "Don't say it."

300
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,820
不不不 没事的
No, it's okay.

301
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,680
他早就告诉过我这个故事了
He told me that story a long time ago.

302
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,770
Raj 怎么这样!
Raj!

303
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:05,900
那是我们第一次约会
It was our first date,

304
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,020
没人说话 气氛很尴尬
there was an awkward silence.

305
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,440
我还能说什么?
What was I supposed to say?

306
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,610
喔 真漂亮
Oh, it's beautiful.

307
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,830
姑娘们手艺真不错
Oh, the girls really did a nice job.

308
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,030
嗷...
Aw...

309
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,450
我知道一开始我有点不情愿
I know I wasn't into this before,

310
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,010
不过作为第一个带你参加舞会的人 我很荣幸
but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.

311
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,960
为什么你觉得我没去过舞会?
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom?

312
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,010
- 我去啦  - 那好 你和谁一起去的呀?
- I went.  - Well, who'd you go with?

313
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,930
我带了一个叫"寂寞"的小姑娘
I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.

314
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,100
哦...
Aw...

315
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,470
没事的
Aw, it's all right.

316
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,800
我们最后还和她的朋友"羞耻"
We ended up having a threesome

317
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
来了个3P 所以...
with her friend humiliation, so...

318
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,360
嗯 如果当时我在场还看见你一个人的话
Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone,

319
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,640
我会邀请你跳支舞的
I would've asked you to dance.

320
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,730
不 你不会的
No, you wouldn't have.

321
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,810
这可轮不到你说
Well, you don't know that.

322
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,280
当时我还没经历青春期迅速长高的阶段
It was before my growth spurt.

323
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,400
什么 你已经长高过了?
What, that already happened?

324
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,480
真好笑
Very funny.

325
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,950
嗯 你也不可能邀请我
Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.

326
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,150
我会啊
I would have asked you.

327
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,200
在我的脑海里
In my head.

328
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,380
在我回家的路上
On the way home.

329
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,490
还在大哭一场的时候
While I was having a good cry.

330
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,690
Sheldon 我能进来吗?
Sheldon, can I come in?

331
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,850
我不觉得这是个好主意
I don't think that's a good idea.

332
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,190
为什么不?
Why not?

333
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,240
按一个在线留言板说的
According to an online message board,

334
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,440
我现在可能是恐慌症发作
I may be having a panic attack.

335
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,530
跟SoccerMom09是同样的问题
SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms.

336
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,790
但公平地讲 那天那对双胞胎真是棘手
But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.

337
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,200
你让我很担心
You're making me worry.

338
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,540
发生什么事了?
What's going on?

339
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,290
发生的事就是我们要参加毕业舞会了
What's going on is we're about to go to a prom.

340
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,430
像我们这样的年轻恋人
And there's a great deal of pressure

341
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,430
参加被Bob Eubanks先生称为狂欢的东西
on young couples like us to engage in

342
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,680
真的压力很大啊
what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.

343
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,380
什么压力?
What pressure?

344
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,140
我只是说你看起来很帅
All I said was you look handsome.

345
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,890
你能不能把门打开?
Can you please open the door?

346
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,720
不光是这个
It's not just that.

347
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,310
Leonard和Penny也评论过
Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.

348
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,940
而且我又不瞎
And I'm not blind.

349
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,450
当我看到自己穿着礼裤时的屁股
Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior

350
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,330
都忍不住多看了一眼
in these tuxedo pants.

351
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,320
于是我在你阿姨Glady家见到了Jeanie
So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.

352
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,820
她给了我马尼舍维茨酒
She passed me the Manischewitz,

353
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,490
我看了这张脸一眼
I took one look at this punim,

354
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,490
就几乎激动万分
and I almost plotzed on the kugel.

355
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,830
我谈起印度时 听起来是不是也是这样?
Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?

356
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,890
我妈妈对这事没意见吗?
So, my mother's okay with this?

357
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,470
你妈妈为什么会对我和Stuart在一起有意见呢?
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?

358
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,510
因为他们之间有着奇怪 不合适的关系
'Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.

359
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,760
比你和我在我爸爸的卡罗拉里干的事还奇怪吗?
Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's Corolla?

360
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,400
情况真混乱
This is so messed up.

361
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,440
我知道 我看得超开心
I know, I'm having the best time.

362
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,360
你为什么要来呢?
Why would you even come to this?

363
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,820
你不知道我要来吗?
Didn't you know I'd be here?

364
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,860
都很久以前的事了 Howard
It was a long time ago, Howard.

365
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,990
而且你们不过是表亲 谁在乎?
And you're only second cousins, who cares?

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,450
这么说你知道 但还是把她带来了?
So, you knew and you brought her anyway?

367
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,420
你觉得她对Howard来说足够好 对我来说不够了?!
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?!

368
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,450
是啊
Yeah.

369
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,450
是啊 你跟你自己的妈妈和表妹
Yeah, go have weird relationships

370
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,500
发展奇怪关系去吧
with your own mother and cousin.

371
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,500
这是他的地盘
This is his turf.

372
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,540
对
Yeah.

373
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,380
我当时可能没邀请你跳舞
Well, I might not have asked you to dance then,

374
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,760
- 但我现在要请你跳  - 又没有音乐
- but I will ask you now.  - There's no music.

375
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,050
我不在乎
I don't care.

376
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,220
我们来制造自己的音乐
We'll make our own music.

377
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,190
天啊 现在谁是呆子?
My God, who's the dork now?

378
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,560
谢谢你穿了平底鞋
Thank you for wearing your flats.

379
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,650
谢谢你穿了高跟鞋
Thank you for wearing your heels.

380
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,700
嗯
Mmm.

381
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,070
看看我
Look at me.

382
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,370
我在跟舞会上最漂亮的女孩跳舞
Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.

383
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,410
想拍张我们的照片
Want to take a picture of us and send it

384
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,160
发给你象棋俱乐部的老朋友们吗?
to your old friends in the chess club?

385
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,880
我几年前给他们发过一张你的比基尼照
I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago.

386
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,640
这感觉真好
This is nice.

387
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,560
我有点希望其他人不要来了
I kind of wish no one else was coming.

388
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,680
我知道 我也是
I know, me, too.

389
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,350
但是没有戏剧性场面的舞会应该也很有趣
But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama.

390
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,020
Howie 放开他!
Howie, get off of him!

391
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,270
只要他还想顺着我家家谱往上爬 我就不放!
Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree!

392
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,020
Sheldon 这样太傻了
Sheldon, this is silly.

393
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,440
我不会再错过一场舞会了
I'm not missing another prom.

394
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,580
我要上楼了
I'm going upstairs now.

395
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,160
再见
Good-bye.

396
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,170
我当时真的觉得你很漂亮
I really did think you looked pretty.

397
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,030
真的?
You did?

398
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,420
是的
Yes.

399
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,790
漂亮得让我心慌意乱
So much so that I started to panic.

400
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,590
你放松一下
Well, you can relax.

401
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,290
你觉得我漂亮也不代表
Just because you think I look pretty

402
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,730
我们就要一起度过这个夜晚
doesn't mean we have to spend the night together.

403
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,300
你是因为想去舞会 才想和我一起的吗?
Were you hoping we would because it's a prom?

404
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,470
我一直都希望和你在一起
I'm always hoping.

405
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,220
但今晚我只是想跟你度过一段愉快时光
But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you.

406
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,230
可能还能跟有胳膊的人跳舞
And maybe dance with someone who has arms.

407
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,060
谢谢你的理解
Thank you for understanding.

408
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,320
我当然理解
Of course I understand.

409
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:52,120
Sheldon 听着
Sheldon,

410
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,970
还有句话我一直想说
there's something else I've been wanting to say,

411
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,040
但我说之前 我...
but before I do, I just...

412
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,660
我希望你知道 你不用给我回应的
I want you to know that you don't have to say it back.

413
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,660
我知道你还没准备好
I know you're not ready,

414
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,250
我也不希望你只是因为社交要求
and I don't want you to say it

415
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,750
而说这句话...
just because social convention dictates...

416
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,640
我也爱你
I love you, too.

417
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,330
你说出来了
You said it.

418
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,010
无可否认 我对你的感情
There's no denying I have feelings for you

419
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,180
用其它方式表达不了
that can't be explained in any other way.

420
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,190
我以前只是以为我脑子里有寄生虫
I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite.

421
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,360
但现在看来那说法更牵强了
But that seems even more farfetched.

422
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,360
唯一的解释就是爱
The only conclusion was love.

423
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,000
我知道怎么回事
I know what's happening.

424
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,920
这是恐慌症发作
This is a panic attack.

425
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,460
SoccerMom09说要躺下 把脚抬起来
SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.

426
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,680
好的
Okay.

427
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,540
哇哦 哇哦 等等
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

428
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,100
我爱你也不代表
Just because I love you doesn't mean

429
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,880
女孩可以进我的房间了
girls are allowed in my room.

430
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,890
好的
Okay.

431
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,560
要拍了...
Here we go...

432
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,030
说"茄子"!
Say "Cheese"!

433
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,920
说"茄子"!
Say "Cheese"!

434
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,070
说"表亲"!
Say "Cousin"!

435
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,540
说...
Say...

436
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,540
不好意思
Oh, sorry.

437
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,580
稍等一下 抱歉
Hang on, sorry.

438
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,550
嘿 Debbie
Hey, Debbie.

439
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,550
我... 对 对 我和Jeanie在一起呢
I... Yeah, yeah, I'm here with Jeanie.

440
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,220
好的 但我们只是朋友
Okay, but we're just friends.

441
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,060
是... 好 我得走了
It's... Yeah. I got to go.
