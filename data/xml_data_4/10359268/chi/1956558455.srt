《致命女人》前情提要
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Previously on Why Women Kill...

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,080
你可以随心所欲绿你妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can cheat on your wife all you want,

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,510
但是休想碰我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you're not touching mine.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,320
我爱上你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am in love with you.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,040
你知道规则的  我永远不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You knew the rules. I will never...

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:18,670
离开我妻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}leave my wife.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,380
我能感觉到罗伯还在生那晚的气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I can tell Rob is still mad about the other night.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,480
他已经多日没打给我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He hasn't called in days.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,520
要是他和她在一起那么幸福  为什么还要跟我在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why would he even be with me if he was so happy with her?

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,480
或许她做了什么伤害他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe she did something to hurt him

11
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,370
他需要时间去原谅她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he needs time to forgive her.

12
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,270
我在忙的那个项目
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This project I've been involved with,

13
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,350
快完成了  我会晚上准时回来吃饭  每晚都是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it's almost over. I'll be home in time for dinner. Every night.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,180
是赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's Hector.

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,000
他是我有过的最好的理发师
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He was the best hairdresser I ever had.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,740
卡尔的轻率之举我已经耳闻一段时间了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've known for some time about Karl's indiscretions.

17
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,620
我看到他的车停在某个三流旅馆
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I saw his car parked at some seedy motel.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,190
你到底是怎么想的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What in God's name?

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,570
我们很久没见过面了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We haven't seen each other in years.

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,400
只有赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hector was the only person

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,610
能看清我真实的为人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who ever saw me for the man I truly am.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,920
别再浪漫化你肮脏的一时放纵
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop romanticizing your grubby little fling.

23
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,380
你爱他吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you love him?

24
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,500
爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I do.

25
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,690
你睡着了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You fell asleep.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,870
吃掉它
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Take this.

27
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:05,370
我觉得我不应该吃
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't think I should.

28
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,250
我不在的时候  你们俩是不是睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}While I was away, did you two fuck?

29
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,460
我们绝对睡了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We absolutely fucked.

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,260
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

31
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,500
这是注定要发生的  对吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This was bound to happen, right?

32
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,810
既然我们都住在一起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Since we're all together now.

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,700
我们来谈谈我的剧本吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, let's talk about my script.

34
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,070
我估计出价能有六位数  接近一百万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm expecting offers in the high six-figure range.

35
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,410
好好待洁德  她是你的灵感女神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Be good to Jade. She's your muse.

36
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,450
他的灵感女神
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His muse?

37
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,280
过去两年  收拾烂摊子的人是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am the one who spent the last two years

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,610
收拾烂摊子的人是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}cleaning up the mess he made of our lives.

39
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,340
-他干什么了  -他什么没干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What did he do? - What didn't he do?

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,980
安非他命  可卡因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Speed, cocaine.

41
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,780
他是个瘾君子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's an addict.

42
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,680
制片人之一想要我改写
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}One of the producers wants a rewrite.

43
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,710
如果我可以按时把作品交上去的话  我就能回归
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And if I can get it to them on time, then... I'm back.

44
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,120
然后就会有收入了  洁德  我就可以照顾你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And the money that will follow, Jade, I can take care of you.

有段时间没联系过了

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,660
我还以为你找到别人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. Thought maybe you had, uh, found someone else.

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,450
不不  不是那样的  我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no, nothing like that. I just, you know...

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Took a different path for a while.

-是啊  -我印象中她还是个婴儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I know. - In my head, I still think of her as a baby.

93
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,900
-在小孩世界里  24个月就像是一生  -嗯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah, well, 24 months is like a lifetime in kid-years. - Yeah.

94
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,470

96
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,970
就加了15%的婴儿泻药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just, like, 15% baby laxatives.

97
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,220

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,450
是从哥伦比亚海运过来的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just fell off the back of a fucking boat from Colombia.

100
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,290
我只是将它切开  打包
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, all I did was chop it up and bag it,

101
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,850
我发誓  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I swear to God, Eli,

102
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,000
你一打开  你的整张脸就会麻痹掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the second you open it, your entire face goes numb.

103
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,330
多少钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, how much?

104
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,660
3.5克三百块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give you an eight ball for 300?

105
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,300
你买两份的话  我可以五百卖你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or I can do two for five.

106
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,720
不过这是我能开出的最大折扣了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's the best I can do, though.

107
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,450
我想给谭雅的大学基金存钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm trying to save for Tanya's college fund.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,290
你是个好妈妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you're a good mom.

109
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,040
好  我要两份
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, I'll take two.

110
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,300
好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay.

111
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,060
很开心你回来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nice to have you back.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,030
卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl.

113
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,000
我们得谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We need to talk.

114
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,700
该死  现在才早上7点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bloody hell, it's 7:00 in the morning.

115
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,130
我昨晚很生你气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was so angry with you last night.

116
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,510
你跟我说话的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The way you spoke to me.

117
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,700
听着  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, Simone...

118
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,850
我整晚没睡一直在想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was up all night thinking to myself,

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,770
真希望自己没跟那个男人结婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}"I wish I'd never married that man.

120
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,670
他偷走了我生命中这十年的时光
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's stolen the last ten years of my life."

121
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,020
好吧  抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, I'm sorry.

122
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,500
给  穿上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here, put that on.

123
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,370
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

124
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,420
快点穿吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just do it.

125
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,620
行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

126
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,240
然后我开始想我们在一起共度的时光
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then I started thinking about our time together.

127
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,430
你教我怎么滑雪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You taught me how to ski...

128
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,830
怎么跳探戈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...how to tango.

129
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,990
怎么说法语
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hmm. How to speak French.

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,620
学会怎么再要一杯霞多丽可不算说法语
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Asking for more chardonnay is not really speaking French.

131
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,030
最重要的是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Most importantly,

132
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,350
你教会我怎么自嘲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you taught me how to laugh at myself.

133
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,390
事实上  你没有偷走我的任何东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The truth is, you haven't stolen anything from me.

134
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,100
如果有的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If anything,

135
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,870
你给我的远远超过了我应得的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you've given me more than I deserved.

136
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:13,640
很抱歉  我快被你吊胃口到烦死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm sorry, the suspense is slightly killing me now.

137
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,930
你到底要说什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where is this going?

138
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,320
跟我来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Follow me.

139
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,970
说清楚  我还是觉得我们该离婚
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just to be clear, I still think we should get a divorce.

140
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,950
我猜也是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, yes, I assumed as much.

141
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,250
但是就因为你不能做我的丈夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But just because I can't have you as a husband

142
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,110
不代表你不能做我的朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}doesn't mean I can't have you as a friend.

143
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,370
我是喜欢让自己的朋友开心快乐的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I do like to keep my friends happy.

144
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,350
赫克托
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hector.

145
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,700
你好  卡尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Karl.

146
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,040
我从未比此刻更加爱你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have never loved you more than I do in this moment.

147
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,770
拜托卡尔  别当着你男友秀恩爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please, Karl, not in front of the boyfriend.

148
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,410
你好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello.

149
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,710
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila.

150
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,400
你的公寓管理员跟我说你在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your apartment manager told me you were down here.

151
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,180
我希望能跟你吃个午饭
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was hoping we could get lunch.

152
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,790
抱歉  餐厅打电话让我去上班
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry, I just got called into work.

153
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,960
两个侍应生病了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Two waitresses are sick.

154
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
我得把制服洗干净然后去格伦代尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have to clean my uniform and get over to Glendale.

155
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,110
没关系  我们改天再聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's fine. We can catch up another time.

156
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,000
确实有很多需要聊的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, there's certainly a lot to catch up on.

157
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,230
发生什么事了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Has something happened?

158
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,410
佩尔斯基夫人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mrs. Persky...

159
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,230
请你离开一下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need you to leave.

160
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,110
为何
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

161
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,690
我得跟朋友聊聊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to talk to my friend.

162
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,810
聊什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What about?

163
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,750
这是私事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's private.

164
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,310
关于性的  是吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So sex, huh?

165
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,610
赶紧走吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just go!

166
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,140
你好像很烦躁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You seem irritable.

167
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,370
罗伯甩了我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob dumped me.

168
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,360
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He did?

169
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,660
他送来了玫瑰花  附了一张便条
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, he sent roses with a note

170
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,220
写着  "我不能再见你了  请原谅我"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}saying, "I can't keep seeing you, please forgive me."

171
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,870
好吧  你知道总会有这么一天的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, well, you knew this day was coming.

172
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,560
是啊  我以为他会像个男人一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. I just thought he would be man enough

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,030
跟我当面说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}to tell me to my face.

174
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,900
我昨天给他工作的地方打了十次电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, I phoned him at his work yesterday ten times.

175
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,660
他的秘书克莱尔不给我转接
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His secretary, Claire, won't put me through.

176
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:12,880
亲爱的  是时候该向前看了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, honey, it is time to move on.

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,860
你也不想自讨没趣吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You don't want to embarrass yourself. Well--

178
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,850
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,110
你又回来干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing back here?

180
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,450
我带了我丈夫来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I brought my husband.

181
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,480
我想让他看看你是怎么跟我说话的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want him to see how you talk to me.

182
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,590
我该走了  晚点联系你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I should go. I'll call you later.

183
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,750
-谢谢  -抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Thanks. - Sorry...

184
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,100
怎么拉着一张脸
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Aw, why the long face?

185
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,500
你的那位甩了你吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did your fella dump you?

186
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:37,440
你妻子真的是个很差劲的人  你知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your wife is a horrible person. Do you know that?

187
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,240
是的  我知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, I'm aware.

188
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,310
我以为我们很为这个出价而高兴呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought we were excited about the offer.

189
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,630
不  不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no.

190
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,700
听着  我当然相信你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, of-of course I trust you.

191
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,220
嗯  你做你的专业事  很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah. I mean, do your thing. Okay.

192
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,490
好吧  再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, bye.

193
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,270
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, shit.

194
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,330
一切可好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is everything all right?

195
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,370
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. Uh, yes.

196
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,830
已经有人出价买我的剧本
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, there's-there's an offer on the table for the script.

197
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,120
但是拉马尔想再等等更高出价
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But Lamar wants to hold out for more money,

198
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,340
你知道这让我觉得很紧张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}which, you know, makes me kind of nervous.

199
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,750
你又吃了什么药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you on right now?

200
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,110
什么  我没有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? Nothing.

201
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,540
是吗  那这是什么动作
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, yeah? Then what's this, then?

202
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,700
今年的花粉非常厉害
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It-it... it's a heavy pollen year.

203
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,500
伙计
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Dude...

204
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:27,870
都上新闻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's been on the news.

205
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,350
我们是一条船上的蚂蚱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We are on the same team.

206
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,340
如果你要犯傻我也救不了你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I cannot cover for you if you're gonna be stupid about it.

207
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,750
好吧  很抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right, I'm sorry.

208
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,500
阿得拉对我来说已经没效果了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The addy wasn't cutting it for me anymore,

209
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,040
所以我需要点药效更强的东西
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}so I just-- I needed something a little bit stronger.

210
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,910
为什么  剧本都写完了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why? The script is done.

211
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,810
你们在哪
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Guys?

212
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,100
我们在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, we're in here.

213
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,670
别拿手弄鼻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get your hand out of your face.

214
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,410
-好吧  -抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- All right. - Sorry.

215
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
我得跟你们俩谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need to talk to you both.

216
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,340
-好的  你想谈什么  -听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah, what's on your mind? - Look,

217
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,170
我知道我说过对你们俩的事情我不计较
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know I said I was okay with what went on with you two,

218
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,960
但显然我是计较的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but clearly, I wasn't.

219
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,340
我感觉自己只走了一晚上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I felt like I went away for the night,

220
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,270
你们就突然组成了一个没有我的小队
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you two had suddenly become this little team without me.

221
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,140
我知道指责你们并不公平
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And it's not fair to blame you,

222
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,530
因为是我当初让咱们三个走到一起的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because I'm the reason we're all together in the first place.

223
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:10,250
我只是觉得在不知道会如何发展的情况下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just feel like I talked you into this

224
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,120
我劝你们加入了这段关系
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with absolutely no idea of how we would make it work.

225
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,700
没事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, that's okay.

226
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,510
-我们可以想出办法的  -是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah. I mean, we will figure it out. - We will.

227
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,530
但是我们需要一些帮助
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But we're gonna need some help,

228
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,690
我已经找好了一个开始的地方
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I think I found just the place to start.

233

不算是群P
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, it's not an orgy.

234
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,540
就是个多角情爱的活动

235
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,950
这不就是"群P"的委婉说法吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Isn't that just a fancy way of saying "Orgy"?

236
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,070
别再说群P了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop saying orgy.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We'll leave tomorrow. - All right.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah, wonderful. - Yeah. Yep.

253
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,250
你没事吧  宝贝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You okay, babe?

254
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,950
没事没事  就是有点过敏
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, yeah, just, you know, allergies. Oof.

255
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,160
今年花粉四处弥漫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It is a heavy pollen year.

256
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,690
都上新闻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It was on the news.

257
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,370
倒香槟啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Here comes the bubbly.

258
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,430
倒吧  就像世界末日来了一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Pour like there's no tomorrow.

259
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,000
你就要夺回你的丈夫了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are getting your husband back.

260
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,710
我好开心啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so happy.

261
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,450
当然我也为艾普尔感到难过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course, I feel bad for April.

262
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,560
为什么  早知今日何必当初
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why? She should've known what was coming.

263
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,150
这就是电影的标准结局:
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is how the movie always ends:

264
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,660
男人回到妻子身边
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the man slinks back to his wife,

265
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,870
狐狸精独自买醉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and the whore ends up drunk and alone.

266
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,150
我现在有四个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Actually, now that I got four kids,

267
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,700
听起来没那么糟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it doesn't sound so bad.

268
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,880
我在想下周带艾普尔去餐厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was thinking of taking April to a restaurant next week.

269
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,960
你懂的  去给她打气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, to cheer her up.

270
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,680
贝丝·安  战争结束了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Beth Ann, the war is over.

271
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,200
你赢了  让敌人在失败中蹒跚吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You won. Let the enemy limp away in defeat.

272
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,820
过去几周艾普尔和我变得很亲密
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April and I grew very close these last few weeks.

273
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,160
这是真正的友谊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's a true friendship.

274
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,120
她以为你的名字是希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She thinks your name is Sheila.

275
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,280
我承认  这很复杂...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I admit, it's a complicated...

276
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,200
宝贝  怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey! What's wrong?

277
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,750
艾普尔在我的车道上
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}April is in my driveway.

278
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,170
我去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit.

279
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,830
她来这干嘛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What is she doing here?

280
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,310
我他妈怎么知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why the fuck should I know?

281
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:26,590
我们不能开门
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We can't open the door.

282
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,660
应该避免不了了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think we're gonna have to.

283
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,710
我觉得她看到我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think she saw me.

284
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,500
你得假装是我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have to be me.

285
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,880
你疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you crazy?

286
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,170
拜托  我求你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Please. I'm begging.

287
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,860
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fine.

288
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,510
我勒个去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Christ on a cracker.

289
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,530
别讲脏话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't swear.

290
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
友善一点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And be nice.

291
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,290
需要帮忙吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}May I help you?

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,620
你是罗伯特·斯坦顿太太吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you Mrs. Robert Stanton?

293
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,170

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

294
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,920
请问你是谁  可以告诉我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And who might you be, pray tell?

295
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,290
我是艾普尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm April.

297
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,810
你丈夫是我的常客之一
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your husband is one of my regulars.

298
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,240

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is he?

299
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

300
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,890
我不是有意催你的  亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't mean to rush you, dear,

301
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:10,730
但我有窗帘要镶边  烤箱里还烤着面包
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I have curtains to hem and croutons in the oven.

302
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,690
好的  我只是想过来告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I just wanted to come by to say

303
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,160
你丈夫吃饭时把外套落在餐厅了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that I think your husband might have left his coat at the diner.

304
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,860
饶了我吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, mercy me.

305
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,060
我不确定是不是他的  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I'm not even sure if it's his, but...

306
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,410
如果你不介意的话请告诉他我来过
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}if you wouldn't mind just telling him that I stopped by

307
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:28,190
然后让他给我打电话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and asking him to call me.

308
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,350
他知道你的号码...[意大利人口音]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He knows your number...

309
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,490
号码
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}number?

310
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,400
打给餐厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At the diner.

311
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,970
他可以打给餐厅找我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He could just give me a call at the diner.

312
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,170
我会转告的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll tell him.

313
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,660
-再见吧  -再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Bye now. - Goodbye.

314
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,080
我从来没说过"饶了我吧"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have never said "Mercy me."

315
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,840
但是你确实会自己烤面包
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But you do bake your own croutons.

316
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,660
不敢相信艾普尔真的来我家了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't believe April actually came to the house.

317
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,390
不得不说  她挺厉害的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Got to say, I'm impressed.

318
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,090
那逼可不会轻易认输
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That tramp, she ain't going down without a fight.

319
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,060
我这逼也不会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, this tramp isn't either.

320
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,470
你懂我意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what I mean.

321
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,620
我十分钟后就得出发
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have to leave in ten minutes,

322
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,330
我完全不知道该穿什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and I have got absolutely no idea what to wear.

323
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,590
你真可爱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're so cute,

324
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,240
去和新男友吃个晚餐这么激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}all aflutter over your dinner with your new beau.

325
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,060
这个粉色会不会太基了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is this pastel too gay?

326
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,150
你有见过不基的粉色吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Have you ever seen a straight pastel?

327
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,010
你能放下报纸来帮帮我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will you please put the paper down and help me?

328
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,140
我打算给你找个好地方住
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm trying to find a nice place for you to live.

329
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,600
桑福德帕姆斯的公寓房间怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, what about a condo at Sanford Palms?

330
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,920
桑福德帕姆斯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sanford Palms?

331
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,430
那地方离这里就五个街区
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's only about five blocks away from here.

332
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,100
我还是想和你共度电影之夜
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I still want us to have our movie nights.

333
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,290
这样你喝了鸡尾酒就不用开车回家啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You wouldn't have to drive home after cocktails.

334
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,700
我们的朋友会鄙视我们的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our friends are going to despise us.

335
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,630
为什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why?

336
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,440
当人们分手时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When people split up,

337
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,540
他们喜欢怨恨和发怒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}they prefer venom and fireworks,

338
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,830
哭闹和指责
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}tears and accusations.

339
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,580
太小孩子气了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So childish and petty.

340
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,870
-再说我们上周已经这样做过了  -也对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Besides, we did that last week. - Right.

341
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,300
我把范围缩小到了这两件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've narrowed it down to these two.

342
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,340
你更喜欢哪件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Which do you prefer?

343
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,240
亚麻的那件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The linen.

344
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
你确定吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure?

345
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,770
你干嘛在意穿什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why do you care which suit?

346
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,580
要不了多久就要脱掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How long is it gonna be on, really?

347
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,880
我是个品行端正的女孩儿  真的[出自电影《窈窕淑女》]
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oi! I'm a good girl, I am.

348
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,590
我只会让给我买了龙虾的先生碰我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't let no gentleman touch me what ain't bought me lobster first.

349
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,830
是汤米来了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, that's Tommy.

350
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,040
跟他说话别学伊莉莎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Don't do Eliza for him.

351
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,210
他理解不了这梗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He won't understand the reference,

352
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,870
他会以为你中风了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he'll think you're having a stroke.

353
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,660
没错  年轻一代人失去了很多幽默感
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. Much humor is lost on the younger generation.

354
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,380
裤子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Trousers!

355
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,100
汤米  快进来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy. Come in.

356
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
格罗夫先生去哪儿了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where's Mr. Grove?

357
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,390
他今晚有约会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He has a date tonight.

358
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,180
跟男人吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}With a guy?

359
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,680
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

360
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,690
我虽然失去了丈夫  但却收获了一个"基蜜"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've lost a husband, but I've gained a gay sidekick.

361
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,750
我很高兴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm glad.

362
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,770
因为现在...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because now...

363
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,070
我们再亲热就不用躲躲藏藏的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}we don't have to hide when we do this.

364
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,970
我感觉到有奇怪的东西在顶着我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm feeling something interesting.

365
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,960
那能怪我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you blame me?

366
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,420
我不是说你的下面  是这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not down there-- up here.

367
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,540
这是送给我的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is this for me?

368
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,770
我本来想留到晚餐后再送给你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was saving that for after dinner.

369
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,040
你能再等一会儿吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you think you can wait?

370
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,000
真是个好问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What a question.

371
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,550
当然等不及啦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course not.

372
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,200
太美了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's stunning.

373
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,640
你的品味提升了不少
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your taste is improving.

374
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,850
像你这样的女人值得拥有最好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A woman like you deserves the best.

375
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:56,430
我希望你能明白  我可以给予你最好的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I-I want you to see that I can give that to you.

376
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,660
汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy!

377
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,180
他还没走吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He hasn't left yet?

378
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,610
谢天谢地我逮着你了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank God I caught you.

379
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,270
我需要外人对我的服装发表下看法
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need fresh eyes on an outfit.

380
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,760
萨蒙妮更喜欢亚麻布的这件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, Simone prefers the linen,

381
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,730
但我觉得海军蓝的这件更显瘦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I think the navy's more slimming.

382
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,670
你觉得呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thoughts?

383
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,590
你本来就不胖啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Y-You're not fat.

384
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,980
没错  作为直男  我的确算是很瘦了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes. As a straight man, I am boyishly slim.

385
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,860
但作为基佬  我还是再瘦一点比较好  所以...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}However, as a homo, I could afford to lose a few. So...

386
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,890
瞧瞧汤米送了我什么礼物
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See what Tommy gave me.

387
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,050
天呐  瞧瞧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hark at you.

388
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,170
戴蒙德·吉姆·布雷迪手段
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Diamond Jim Brady Bunch.

389
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,360
总之  该选哪件
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, which one?

390
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,670
随便选一件吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Just pick one.

391
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,170
海军蓝
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Navy.

392
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,710
那就海军蓝了  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Navy it is. Thank you.

393
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,790
我很抱歉打扰你们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm terribly sorry to interrupt,

394
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,040
但你们也知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but, as you know,

395
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,200
要出柜  选对衣服是极其重要的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}it's very important to get the costume right when you're coming out.

396
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,870
我们不在乎你出不出柜  只要你出门就行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We don't care if you come out, just as long as you get out.

397
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,560
稍微暗示下我自然会懂的  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can always take a subtle hint, Simone.

398
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,590
或许有一天  你能学会这点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Perhaps, one day, you'll give me one.

399
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,440
跟赫克托说  如果他不给我做婚礼发型
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, tell Hector you won't sleep with him

400
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,140
你就不跟他上床
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}unless he does my hair for the wedding!

401
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,660
没问题  再见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You got it! Goodbye!

402
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,800
你的婚姻真是有趣极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You have a very interesting marriage.

403
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,950
希拉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila.

404
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,880
你来这里干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Um, what are you doing here?

405
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,910
昨天的见面被迫中断了  所以我...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Our visit was cut short yesterday, so I just...

406
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,530
现在不是时候  我觉得有点不舒服
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now's not really a good time; I'm feeling under the weather.

407
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,470
你想让我替你去药店买药吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you want me to run to the drugstore for you?

408
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,140
不  不用  我只需要...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, no, no. I just...

409
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,770
服用几片阿司匹林就好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}need a couple of aspirin.

410
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,430
坐下  我来帮你拿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sit. I'll get them for you.

411
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,700
不必麻烦你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, you don't have to do that.

412
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,970
没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's no trouble.

413
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,500
再说  我还有好消息要告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Besides, I have some good news.

414
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,610
那很好啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's nice.

415
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,940
我倒是需要听听好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I could use some.

416
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,740
我给你找到一个好对象
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I've found you a man.

417
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,300
他叫埃尔顿·拉辛格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His name's Eldon Ratzinger.

418
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,130
埃尔顿·拉辛格
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eldon Ratzinger.

419
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:35,290
他是我相熟的屠夫  人很好
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's my butcher. Very nice.

420
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,210
虽说人有点矮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}On the short side,

421
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,250
但如果你穿平底鞋其实也注意不到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but you wouldn't notice if you're wearing flats.

422
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,060
谢谢  但是...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thanks, but...

423
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,240
我近期以内都不想再恋爱了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't meet anyone for a while.

424
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,700
如果你坐在家里闷闷不乐  是忘不了罗伯的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You won't forget about Rob if you sit around pouting.

425
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,280
相信我  我短时间内都不可能忘掉罗伯
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Trust me, I won't be forgetting about Rob anytime soon.

426
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,430
你必须克服对有妇之夫的痴迷
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You've got to get over this obsession with another woman's husband.

427
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,410
你最后只会落得愤怒  悲伤的下场
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're going to end up angry and sad.

428
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,240
你说得很对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are right about that.

429
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,310
其实  罗伯留下给我的并不只有花
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, flowers aren't the only thing that Rob left me with.

430
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,920
你什么意思
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you talking about?

431
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,400
我怀孕了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm pregnant.

432
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,290
希拉  你受伤了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sheila, are you hurt?

433
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,150
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.

434
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,690
-没错  我伤得很重  -我去给你拿绷带
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}-Yes, I am. - Let me get you a bandage.

435
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,710
我来帮你拿  我的贵妇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let me get that for you, my lady.

436
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,150
我的另外一位贵妇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And my other lady.

437
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,940
你可真有绅士风度
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How chivalrous of you.

438
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,260
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

439
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,010
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

440
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,120
要我来开会儿车吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You want me to drive for a bit?

441
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,750
抱歉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry.

442
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,980
我只是对剧本的事感到很紧张
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think I'm just nervous about the script, you know?

443
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,830
你介意我们停一下  让我给拉马尔打个电话吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Actually, do you guys mind if we pull off so I can call Lamar?

444
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,080
那可以让你不再把方向盘当邦哥鼓来敲打吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Will that stop you from playing the steering wheel like a bongo drum?

445
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,990
几乎绝对可以
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Almost definitely.

446
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,130
那你就这么做吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then by all means.

447
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,950
好极了  就在前面停车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, great. Here we go.

448
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,370
好极了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, great.

449
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,180
不知道这里有没有厕所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I wonder if they have a bathroom.

450
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,690
我们可以去便利店问问
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, we can ask inside the mini-mart.

451
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,300
你想要什么吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you want anything?

452
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,990
薯片
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, potato chips.

453
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,540
巧克力奶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And chocolate milk.

454
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,590
如果有的话  再买些虫形软糖
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And gummy worms, if they have 'em.

455
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,970
你是12岁的小孩吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you, 12?

456
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,010
我知道你是  但我呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know you are, but what am I?

457
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,670
我一定会把这事告诉那些多角恋朋友的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The polyamorists will hear about this.

458
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,920
操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fuck!

459
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,640
该死  该死  该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

460
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,000
坏消息  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Bad news, Eli!

461
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,370
没有虫形软糖了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They were out of worms.

462
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,270
不要啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

463
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,980
所以我给你买了小熊软糖
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So I got you bears.

464
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,130
谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

465
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,550
你开后备箱做什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing in the trunk?

466
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,070
我在找我的棒球帽
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, looking for my baseball cap.

467
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,690
这样啊  那帽子在哪儿呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ah. So, where is it?

468
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,480
我忘记把它装包了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Forgot to pack it.

469
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,340
笨伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fuckin' Eli.

470
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,890
好了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

471
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,970
我们出发吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Let's hit the road.

472
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,120
亲爱的  你今早能否替我照看下画廊呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Darling, is there any chance you can watch the gallery for me this morning?

473
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,290
你要去哪儿
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where will you be?

474
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,640
我有一个预约
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, I have an appointment.

475
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,760
这样啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh.

476
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,780
这预约和你的新男朋友赫克托有关吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And would this appointment involve your new boyfriend Hector?

477
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,660
他也许会一起来  没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He may tag along, yes.

478
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,800
瞧你那小样  骄傲的同志男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at you, proud gay man.

479
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,780
你知道我会全心全力支持你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know I'd do anything to support you.

480
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,290
其实也就是取消我的健身房私教课
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Short of canceling my training session at the gym.

481
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,210
你不也是一副同志男人[快乐的人]的模样吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you sure you'renot a gay man?

482
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:38,520
娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi.

483
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,240
我以为我们约好在俱乐部见面的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I thought we were meeting at the club.

484
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,990
你永远不知道谁会在偷听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You never know who's eavesdropping there.

485
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,000
而我将要说的  只能说给你的耳朵听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And what I have to say is for your ears only.

486
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,140
你好啊  娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello, Naomi.

487
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,250
我的耳朵和我正准备离开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}My ears and I were just leaving.

488
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,180
不劳您大驾了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Thank you.

489
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,370
你看起来很不安啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You seem upset.

490
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,770
你还记得我跟你说汤米在隐瞒些什么事吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Remember when I told you that Tommy was hiding something?

491
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,770
我知道他的秘密了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know his secret.

492
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You do?

493
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,190
他在吸毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's on drugs.

494
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,530
谢天谢地啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, thank God.

495
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,000
你终于弄明白了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That you finally figured it out.

496
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,840
只有这样才能说得通...整天神神秘秘
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's the only thing that makes sense-- the secrecy,

497
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,200
午夜才回家  还给卧室门上锁
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the long hours, the lock on his bedroom door.

498
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,740
更别提不见踪影的钱了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not to mention the missing money.

499
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,990
什么钱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What money?

500
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,170
他把他的储蓄债券兑现了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He cashed in his savings bond.

501
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,490
他18岁成年后  这笔钱就归他所有
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They became his when he turned 18.

502
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,190
我本不该知道这事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And I'm not supposed to know,

503
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,680
不过我在银行的朋友偷偷告诉我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but my friend at the bank tipped me off.

504
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,510
我问你  萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I ask you, Simone,

505
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,810
他买什么需要花一万块
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}what else could he have bought that cost $10,000?

506
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,650
他花了一万吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He spent $10,000?

507
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,190
我就知道你会理解我的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I knew you'd understand.

508
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,470
你真是个知心朋友
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're such a good friend.

509
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,670
我知道我们曾经闹过不和
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know we've had our squabbles.

510
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,200
但是在这样的危机面前
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But in a crisis like this,

511
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,170
我只有和你才可以倾诉倾诉了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}there is no one else I can turn to.

512
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,520
只有我吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No one?

513
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,820
你觉得他在吸什么毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do you think he's doing?

514
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,630
海洛因吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Heroin?

515
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,880
我们可是在说汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is Tommy we're talking about.

516
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,900
我才不相信他会去吸海洛因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I seriously doubt he's on heroin.

517
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,190
哎呀  这胸针真漂亮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What? That's a beautiful brooch.

518
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,090
是你新买的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is it new?

519
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,990
不过再仔细想想  他确实有可能是在吸海洛因
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Then again, it could be heroin.

520
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,260

快看这地方  可真不错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, look at this place. It's cute.

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, man.

524
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,300
他们为什么要拦下每辆车啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are they stopping everyone?

525
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,620
谁知道呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who knows?

526
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,130
居然有这么多车
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at all these cars.

527
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,430
谁能想到多角恋这么流行呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Who knew polyamory was so popular?

528
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,600

副总统彭斯今晚将在这里讲话

530
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,590
在一个多角恋研讨会上吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At a polyamory seminar?

531
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,820
-那可真令人意外  -好奇怪的选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- That's surprising. - Odd choice.

532
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,970
不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No.

533
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,560
他的活动是在酒店的另一间宴会厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's in a different ballroom.

534
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,530
他将与"当地共和党人士"交谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He's talking to "Local Republicans."

535
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,820
原来他们拦车是因为这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, that's the reason for the holdup.

536
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,350
安保加强了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's extra security.

537
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,910
安保啊...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, security...

538
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,060
他们在逐个开后备箱检查
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They're opening people's trunks.

539
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,610
那要等好久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's gonna take forever.

540
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,330
你猜怎么着  二位
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know what, guys?

541
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,130
我们...我们需要掉个头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We-we, we need to turn around.

542
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,060
-你说什么  -没错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - Yeah.

543
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,240
-为什么啊  -我得...我得去尿尿

544
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,870
实在对不起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so sorry.

-我真的...  -亲爱的  我刚才是开玩笑的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I just... - No, honey, I was kidding.

546
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,430
酒店就在前面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The hotel is just up the street.

547
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,810
-我们很快就能到那...  -不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- We'll be there in, like... - Nope.

548
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:25,590
不行  "大坝"就要泄了  我们这就...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can't do it. Dam's gonna burst. Here-here we go...

549
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,570
别这样  亲爱的  慢着  你在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, honey, wait, what are you doing?

550
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,830
你到底在干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What are you doing?

551
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,850
我在努力调头
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh! I'm flipping a bitch.

552
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,610
等下  伊莱  你搞什么...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait-- Eli, what...

553
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,120
你不能在这进行U形转弯啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You can't make a U-turn here.

554
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,090
现在更像是一个三点转向了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yeah, well, now it's turning into a bit more of a three-point thing.

555
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,840
-伊莱...  -伊莱  不要这样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Eli... - Eli, no!

556
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:37,790
或是四点转向
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Or four.

557
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,240
伊莱  我的天呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli! Oh, my God!

558
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,510
我的神呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God.

559
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,810
伊莱  你到底在干嘛啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli, what are you doing?

560
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,070
他们会把我们当作恐怖分子之类的了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}They're gonna think that we're terrorists or something.

561
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,420
现在是五点转向了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Five.

562
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,760
看到了吗  多么流畅的驾驶技术
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See that? Smooth sailing.

563
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,040
-你他妈的疯了吗  天...  -流畅的驾驶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Have you lost your fucking mind? Jesus... - Smooth sailing.

564
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,230
伊莱  开慢点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli, slow down!

565
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,290
你要把我们都害死的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're gonna get us all killed.

566
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,900
各位  都淡定点  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, wha-- everyone, just calm down, okay?

567
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,690
前面不远处有家塔可钟餐厅
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}There's a Taco Bell a couple miles down the road.

568
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,370
我们就停在那里  一切都会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Right? We'll stop there, it's gonna be fine.

569
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,260
好吗  一切都会没事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right? Everything is gonna be fine.

570
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,130
怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

571
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,040
停车  现在就停下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Stop the car. Now.

572
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
好吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}All right.

573
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,550
你干什么...你为什么要开后备箱啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What-- Why are you opening the trunk?

574
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,190
因为我想看看里面都有什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because I want to know what's in there.

575
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:28,680
泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Taylor!

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,390
糟了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Shit.

577
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,470
伊莱  你的鼻子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli, your nose.

578
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,250
操
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Fuck.

579
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,530
等下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Wait.

580
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,790
我的天呐  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God. Eli.

581
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,890
我...我知道这看起来很糟糕
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I know that it looks bad.

582
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,180
坐回车里  我们回家
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Get in the car. We're going home.

583
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,630
那...那度假怎么办呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}W-What about the retreat?

584
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,470
去他妈的度假
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, fuck the retreat.

585
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,970
她怀孕了  天呐
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Pregnant? Jesus.

586
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,950
她不仅是个淫妇  还是个愚蠢的淫妇
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She's not only a tramp, she's a stupid tramp.

587
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,370
-我现在不想喝酒  -亲爱的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I don't want to drink right now. - Oh, honey.

588
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,500
这都是我要喝的  你的生活让我窒息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is all for me. I find your life very stressful.

589
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,450
至少我们现在知道艾普尔为什么这么急切地想联系罗伯了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}At least we know why April was so desperate to speak to Rob.

590
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,270
你觉得他会有什么反应
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How do you think he'll react?

591
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,970
我觉得他会很激动的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think he will be thrilled.

592
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,360
真的吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really?

593
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,720
罗伯以前很喜欢当爸爸的感觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob loved being a father.

594
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:46,890
当我们失去艾米莉的时候  这是我们女儿的名字
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When we lost Emily-- that was our daughter's name...

595
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,930
这名字很美
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's a beautiful name.

596
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,930
他无法接受我们失去了艾米莉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When we lost Emily, he couldn't accept it.

597
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,380
罗伯求我再生一个孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob begged me to have another child.

598
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,720
那你为什么没生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why didn't you?

599
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,640
我们尝试了很多次  但是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We tried and tried, but...

600
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,350
你们考虑过领养吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you ever think about adoption?

601
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,990
罗伯说他不想养别的男人的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Rob said he didn't want to raise another man's baby.

602
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,230
他想要一个自己的孩子
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He wanted a child of his own.

603
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,060
现在他就要有一个了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And now he's going to get one.

604
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,040
老天  我真讨厌这个男人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}God, I hate this guy.

605
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,480
别这么说  他还是我的丈夫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}please, he's still my husband.

606
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,480
我现在该怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What do I do now?

607
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,440
摊牌
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come clean.

608
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,830
告诉他外遇和孩子的事情你都知道
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tell him you know about the affair, and the baby.

609
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,930
-不  -是时候把一切都摊开来说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- No.- It's time to put it all on the table.

610
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,060
这会有用吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But how will that help?

611
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,750
这能逼他做出选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It will force him to make a choice.

612
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,690
选你还是她
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You or her.

613
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,300
如果...他没有选我怎么办
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What if... he doesn't choose me?

614
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,950
那你就能终于和我一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, then you'll finally hate the fucking bastard

615
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,570
痛恨这混蛋了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just as much as I do.

616
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,160
我不会的  这就是问题所在
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, I won't. That's the problem.

617
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,260
听着  我不知道他会怎么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look, I don't know what he's gonna do.

618
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,820
也许他会选你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe he'll choose you.

619
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,060
但不管是什么结果
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But whatever happens,

620
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,990
你难道还没受够这些谎言吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}aren't you done with all the lies?

621
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,880
队员们  快跑  小心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, team, let's go. Heads up!

622
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,640
防守  球场北侧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Defense, north side of the field.

623
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,040
进攻  南侧  动起来...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Offense, south side. Let's go...

624
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,400
你来这里干吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey. What are you doing here?

625
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,540
你为什么没告诉我那些钻石是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why didn't you tell me these diamonds were real?

626
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:41,290
它们当然是真的了  我以为你知道的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yea-- of course they're real. I thought you knew that.

627
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,870
但我不知道  拿回去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I didn't. Take this back.

628
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,470
不  我为什么要拿回来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No. Why would I do that?

629
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,080
银行告诉你妈妈说你卖了一份债券
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The bank told your mother you sold a bond.

630
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,700
她现在觉得你在吸毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She now thinks you're on drugs,

631
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,410
知道你把钱花在了这上面
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and knowing what you spent on this,

632
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,570
我在想她有可能是对的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm wondering if she's right.

633
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,180
-我不会收的  -汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm not taking it back. - Tommy.

634
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,640
我应该可以为我心爱的女人买钻石
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I should be able to buy diamonds for the woman I love.

635
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,520
放松  我不指望你也这么说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Relax. I don't expect you to say it back.

636
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,520
我给你钻石是为了让你知道我不是什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I gave you that so you'd see that I'm not just some kid

637
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,230
配不上你的小屁孩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}who can't play in your league.

638
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,480
钻石是真的  因为我对你的感情是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}The diamonds are real because my feelings are.

639
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,180
你知道我喜欢你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know I adore you,

640
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,570
但是我不觉得我们能拥有正常的感情
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I just don't see how we can have that kind of relationship.

641
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,080
因为会有风言风语吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Because of what people would say?

642
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:16,460
-他们会很粗鲁  -所以卡尔跟男人约会
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- They'd be brutal. - So, you're not embarrassed

643
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,420
你不感到丢人  而我却让你觉得丢人了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that Karl dates men, but you are embarrassed by me?

644
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,420
我一点也不觉得丢人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am not embarrassed at all.

645
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,520
我的天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, dear God.

646
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:25,370
汤米  你女朋友是谁啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hey, Tommy! Who's your girlfriend?

647
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,620
我不能留在这了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I can't stay here.

648
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,420
-给  求你拿着吧  -不
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Here, take this, please.- No.

649
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,490
这是属于你的  爱你我并不羞愧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}It's yours. I'm not ashamed to love you.

650
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,570
-泰勒  -闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Taylor... - Don't.

651
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,540
现在谁也别说话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I need for no one to speak right now.

652
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,530
多久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How long?

653
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,470
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sorry?

654
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,840
你复吸有多久了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How long have you been using again?

655
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:16,140
没有很久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Not that long.

656
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,010
-差不多是在...  -别告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I mean, it started... - Don't tell me.

657
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,210
我不想知道我忽视了这些迹象有多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I don't want to know how long I missed the signs.

658
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,340
也不想知道这事在我眼皮子底下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How long this has been happening

659
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,800
进行了多久
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}right in front of my own stupid face.

660
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,330
亲爱的  求你了  你...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Babe, please, you...

661
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,500
闭嘴
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You-- shut up.

662
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,570
我之前被分心了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I was distracted before.

663
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,440
我现在可是睁大了双眼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'd better believe my eyes are wide fucking open now.

664
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,470
喂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hello?

665
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,010
汤米在贩毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Tommy's dealing drugs.

666
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:56,520
什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What?

667
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,540
凯·兰道的儿子布拉德利
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Kay Randall's son Bradley

668
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,980
今天看到他...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}saw him today...

669
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,020
跟一个客户在一起！
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with a customer!

670
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,030
客户
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}A customer?

671
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,660
他看到他在体育课的时候
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He saw him making a deal in the middle of P.E.

672
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,710
跟一个戴着墨镜的恶心中年女人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}with some seedy, middle-aged woman

673
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,310
-做交易  -中年
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- in dark glasses. - Middle-aged?

674
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,920
总之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway,

675
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,130
你有螺丝刀吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}do you have a screwdriver?

676
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,750
我要闯进汤米的房间里去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I want to break into Tommy's room.

677
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,010
为什么  他肯定没把毒品藏在屋里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why? I'm sure he doesn't keep drugs in there.

678
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,490
也许没有  但至少我可以看看他的日记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe not, but at least I could read his journal.

679
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,350
他的日记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}His journal?

680
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,510
我好像找到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think I found one.

681
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,100
你什么意思  他有写日记的习惯吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}W-Well, what do you mean, he keeps a journal?

682
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,370
我得挂了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I have to go.

683
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,770
娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi.

684
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,720
- 娜奥米  - 在这里
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Naomi? - Up here!

685
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,630
娜奥米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi.

686
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,420
你来了真好  你可帮我找
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so glad you're here. You can help me look.

687
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,350
我只是来阻止你做蠢事的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am only here to stop you from making an awful mistake.

688
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,580
如果汤米发现你读过他的日记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}If Tommy finds out you read his journal,

689
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,770
你可能会永远失去他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you could lose him forever.

690
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,920
他不会发现的  他要一直训练到六点
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}He won't find out. He's at track until 6:00.

691
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,970
你把他房间弄这么乱  来不及收拾的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You trashed his room. You won't have time to clean it up.

692
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,090
而且日记也不一定在这
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And the journal may not even be here.

693
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,030
找到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Found it.

694
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,500
萨蒙妮
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Simone.

695
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,070
艾米10岁的时候我看过她的日记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}When Amy was ten, I read her diary.

696
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,780
之后一年她都没跟我说过话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She didn't speak to me for a year.

697
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,240
-给我  -如果她当时是汤米现在这个年纪的话
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Hand it over.- If she had been Tommy's age,

698
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,660
她就直接搬出去了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}she'd have moved out.

699
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:40,020
你真的愿意冒这个风险  就为了偷看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you really want to risk that, just to get an intrusive look

700
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,420
汤米最私密的想法和...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}at Tommy's most private thoughts and...

701
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,370
-老天爷啊  -怎么了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Jesus Christ. - What?

702
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:44,870
没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Nothing!

703
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,190
日记给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Give me that.

704
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,720
作为你的朋友  我求求你  别看
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}As your friend, I am begging you, don't read that.

705
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,540
你为什么这么激动
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why are you so emotional?

706
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,450
卡尔是同性恋
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Karl is gay.

707
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,220
-什么  -他跟男人睡觉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- What? - He sleeps with men.

708
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,430
我们能不能关注一下我的问题
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}can we just focus on my problems for a moment?

709
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,150
怪不得你最近这么心烦意乱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No wonder you're so distraught.

710
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,050
我本想告诉你
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, I wanted to tell you,

711
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,690
但我转念一想  "娜奥米有自己的麻烦
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but then I thought, "No, Naomi has her own problems.

712
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,720
她不需要听我的俗气闹剧"
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She doesn't want to hear my tawdry tale."

713
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,150
但我想听
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, but I do.

714
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:24,540
你是说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You mean to tell me

715
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,720
上次我在旅馆看到卡尔的车时
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that when I saw Karl's car at the motel,

716
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,420
他和一个男人在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}he was there with a man?

717
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,670
我得来杯酒才能接着说
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I can't talk about this without a drink.

718
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,300
也许我们可以下楼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Maybe we could go downstairs and,

719
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
开一瓶
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you know, open up a bottle?

720
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,180
当然  但你怎么发现的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course. But how did you find out?

721
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,740
你抓到他和情人的现行了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Did you catch him with one of his lovers?

722
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,390
不  是旺达  你说得对
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, it was Wanda. You were right.

723
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,890
她鄙视我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She despises me.

724
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,860
-她发现的  -你们在我房间干什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- She found out... - What are you doing in my room?

725
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,890
那是我的日记吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Is that my journal?

726
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,590
她刚找到
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, she just found it,

727
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,830
但还没有读
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but she hasn't read it yet.

728
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,810
对不起  汤米
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm so sorry, Tommy.

729
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,350
我只想确保你没有吸毒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just wanted to make sure that you weren't doing drugs.

730
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,060
所以你就闯进我的房间
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So you broke into my room?

731
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,610
谁让你最近都那么疏远我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, you've been so distant lately.

732
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,030
格罗夫太太  如果你不介意
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mrs. Grove, if you wouldn't mind...

733
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,680
对  我该走了  因为这事和我完全无关
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes, I should go, as this doesn't involve me at all.

734
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,070
天哪  妈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jesus. Mom...

735
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,830
你在找这些
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You looking for these?

736
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,800
太好了  你找到了  谢谢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, good, you found them. Thank you.

737
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,630
你们谈得怎么样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}How'd it go in there?

738
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,040
刚告诉我妈  我打算
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eh, just told Mom that I'm gonna

739
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,870
再兑现一张债券  暑假去欧洲徒步旅行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}cash in another bond so I can hike through Europe this summer.

740
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:33,990
她很愧疚闯进了我的房间  同意了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}She felt so guilty about breaking into my room that she agreed.

741
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,780
你把局势转化成了利己的形势
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You turned the situation to your advantage.

742
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,030
真有你的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Good for you.

743
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,880
我毕业典礼后两天出发去巴黎
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I, uh, leave for Paris two days after graduation.

744
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,840
想一起来吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Care to join me?

745
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,960
你疯了吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you crazy?

746
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,760
我们不用一起走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We don't have to leave at the same time.

747
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,990
我先去  然后你度个假
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll go first, then you take a vacation

748
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,060
和我在欧洲见
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and meet me there.

749
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,800
没人会知道我们是一起去玩
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No one's gonna know that we're together.

750
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,320
你妈在看我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your mother's watching.

751
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,680
所以我们必须去旅游
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That is why we need to do this.

752
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,540
在这总会有人在看我们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someone is always watching us here.

753
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,000
我们永远不知道咱俩是否能成  除非我们远离
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We will never know who we can be as a couple until we get away

754
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,480
我妈  你的朋友们
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}from my mom, your friends,

755
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,990
和其他那些你怕他们对你有看法的人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and everyone else whose opinions you're scared of.

756
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,730
我能考虑一下吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can I think about it?

757
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,550
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Sure.

758
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,270
瞧瞧这丰盛的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Look at this.

759
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,480
有人大费周章啊
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Someone went to a lot of trouble.

760
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,220
不算什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, not so much.

761
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,040
我就放了一些花  摆了上好的银器
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just put out a few flowers, and the good silver,

762
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,740
和你妈妈给我们买的蜡烛
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and the candlesticks your mother bought us.

763
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,590
你想饭前来杯迈泰鸡尾酒吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Would you like a mai tai before dinner?

764
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,880
你还调了迈泰鸡尾酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You made mai tais?

765
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,050
等等  你是不是把车撞了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Hold it. Did you wreck the car?

766
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,970
你怎么会这么想
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Why would you think that?

767
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,920
只有发生了坏事你才会给我调迈泰鸡尾酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You only make mai tais before giving me bad news.

768
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,840
别傻了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}That's silly.

769
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,950
喝你的迈泰鸡尾酒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Now drink your mai tai.

770
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,960
你要去哪呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Where do you think you're going?

771
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,250
-楼上  -你一个人不行
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Upstairs. - Not alone, you're not.

772
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,880
事实上  接下去这么做
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}In fact, this is what's gonna happen right now.

773
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,830
咱俩在这屋子里逛一圈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You and I are gonna take a tour of this house,

774
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,280
你把所有藏毒的地方都告诉我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and you're gonna show me where you've been hiding your stash.

775
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,400
-我没藏毒  我就是  -而且伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- There's no stash. I just... - And you know what, Eli,

776
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,390
把你的行李放下
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}put all that shit down,

777
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:57,960
因为你不必把东西整理出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because you have absolutely no reason to unpack.

778
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,620
明天一早你就去戒毒所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're going to rehab first thing in the morning.

779
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,510
你在逗我吗  戒毒所
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you kidding? Rehab?

780
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,630
-别这样  -你的钱包手机都给我
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Come on. - I want your wallet. And your phone.

781
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,320
我不准你花钱了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You are cut off.

782
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:10,980
不给现金  卡  不准用贝宝或Venmo
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No cash, no cards, no PayPal, no Venmo.

783
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,840
明白吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Do you understand?

784
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,680
我明白你为什么不开心
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know, I understand why you're upset,

785
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:21,980
-但你也不用在洁德面前羞辱我  -错
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- but you don't have to humiliate me in front of Jade, too. - Wrong.

786
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,700
你该被羞辱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should be humiliated.

787
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,800
在上次事件以后
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}After what we went through last time,

788
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,490
一想到你又要让我们经历一次...
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}the idea that you would even put us through this again...

789
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,070
-伊莱  给我  -是拉马尔
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Eli, give it to me. - It's Lamar.

790
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,490
-他可以留言  -可能是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- He'll leave a message. - Just-- It could be

791
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,670
剧本的事呢  你就
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}about the script. Just...

792
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,210
就让我接这个电话吧

805
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,120
并卖出了一个比我们预期高很多的价格

我的天

812
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,460
我的天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, my God!

813
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,950
你说真的吗  我的天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Are you serious? Oh, my God.

00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,600
亲爱的  这真是好消息
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Honey, this is such great news, okay?

817
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,840
你又东山再起了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Your career is back again.

818
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,110
所以你更加需要去戒毒所了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is all the more reason to get you to rehab.

819
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,400
知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You-you know what?

820
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,310
我觉得对我来说时机不合适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-I don't, I don't think it's the best time for me,

821
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:49,150
现在不合适
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}right now.

822
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,870
哥们  你没有别的选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Buddy... you don't really have a choice here.

823
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,690
我的剧本刚卖了一百二十万
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I just sold a script for $1.2 million.

824
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,960
我觉得我的选择多得很
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know? I think I got a lot of fucking choices.

825
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,130
伊莱  我不会眼看着你杀了自己
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Eli... I am not gonna stand by and watch you kill yourself.

826
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:05,390
天哪  别说了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, God. Come on.

827
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,700
这不像上次  好吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is not like last time, all right?

828
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,230
-我现在状态很好  -伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I'm in a completely better place now. - Eli!

829
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,860
这没得商量
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is nonnegotiable.

830
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,230
-泰勒  -知道吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Taylor... - Do you know what...?

831
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,700
你太想控制我了  对吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're so fucking desperate to control me, aren't you?

832
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,320
-真是可悲  -够了  不  伊莱
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- I mean, it's fucking pathetic! - Okay. No, Eli,

833
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,220
你是因为嗑了药才这么说的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}this is the drugs talking.

834
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,190
-你知道的吧  -不  不是
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You know that, right? - No. No. No, it's not.

835
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,850
这是正常的我  我现在清醒得很
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}This is me, okay? I am clear as a fucking bell right now.

836
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,710
从现在起  我的决定我自己做主
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And from now on... I make my own decisions.

837
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,640
好  伊莱  我给你个选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Okay, Eli. Well, here's one for you:

838
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,730
要么你去戒毒所  要么我走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}either you go to rehab, or I walk out that fucking door!

839
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,840
-慢着  慢着  -是吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Whoa. Hold on. Hold on. - Really?

840
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
-是的  -是吗  你就这么走掉
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Yeah. Oh, yeah. - Really? You just walk on out?

841
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,020
-如果你逼我  我会的  -好的  泰勒
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- If you push me, yeah. - Okay. Well, Taylor,

842
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,120
我真的希望你不会走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}you know, I really wish you wouldn't go.

843
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,300
但如果你想走  这是你的选择
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}But if you want to, that's your choice.

844
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,560
看  我永远不会逼你做任何事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}See? I would never force you to do anything.

845
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,550
我们走  洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Come on, Jade.

846
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,480
洁德
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Jade...

847
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,770
我觉得也许我们不该走
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I-- I think maybe we shouldn't go.

848
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,090
-什么  -伊莱需要帮助
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- You what? - Eli needs help.

849
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:16,690
我想帮助他最好的方式
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I think maybe the best way to help him is to

850
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,870
就是留下来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}stay here and-and, you know,

{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}just keep an eye on him.

852
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,700
你选择他
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're choosing him.

853
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:27,530
我选择我们  我选择我们所有人
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm choosing us. I'm choosing all of us.

854
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:28,450
去你妈的

857
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,980

859
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,580
我没那么早开始
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I didn't start all that early.

860
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:59,260

866
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,020
我们真的得谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}We definitely need to have a talk.

867
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,810
老天
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Ah, boy.

你吓到我了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You're starting to scare me.

874
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,210
我也吓到了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm scared, too.

875
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,860
怎么了  出什么事了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}What's going on? What's wrong?

一切都将不一样
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}...everything is going to be different.

879
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,000

892
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,290
你可以试试
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'm guessing you'll try.

893
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:30,030
你知道汤米送我的胸针吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You know the pin Tommy gave me?

894
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,940
那钻石竟然是真的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, it turns out the diamonds were real.

895
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,800
娜奥米气死了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Naomi was furious,

896
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,740
因为他为了买胸针而兑现了他的储蓄债券
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}because he cashed in one of his savings bonds to buy it.

897
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:40,530
总之  她认定他在嗑药
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway, she decided he was on drugs.

898
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,940
她想去看她的日记
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}And that she had to read his journal...

899
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,860
格罗夫先生  有何贵干
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Mr. Grove. How can I help you?

900
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:46,680
我之前和朋友在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, I was with my friend,

901
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,810
他在我背上发现了这个
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he-he spotted this thing on my back.

902
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,070
可能没什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I mean, it's probably nothing,

903
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,540
但他建议我来看医生
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but he-he suggested I see a doctor.

904
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,720
你来看我是正确的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You were right to come see me.

905
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:58,330
娜奥米没有发现让我松了口气
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I am just relieved that Naomi didn't find out.

906
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:00,390
总之
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Anyway...

907
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,710
在我走之前  汤米跑出来
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}before I left, Tommy ran out,

908
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,160
跟我说了件事  我得跟你谈谈
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and said something that I definitely need to talk to you about.

909
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,300
天  我还要再喝点红酒吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Oh, dear. Am I going to need more wine-- Oh!

910
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,110
该死
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Damn it!

911
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:18,510
-严重吗  我看看  -别
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- Oh, is it bad? Let me see... - No!

912
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,900
不用  抱歉  没有很深
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}No, no. No, no, sorry. Um, uh, it-it's not deep.

913
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,340
你能给我拿张创口贴吗
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Can you just get me a Band-Aid?

914
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:27,790
当然
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Of course.

915
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,810
所以汤米说了什么
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Uh, uh, so, uh, what did Tommy say?

916
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:34,410
他暑假要去欧洲
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Well, he's going to Europe for the summer,

917
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,720
他想我跟他一起去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and he wants me to join him.

918
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,360
我知道这听上去很疯狂
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I know it sounds crazy,

919
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,860
但我想这也许不错  花时间跟他在一起
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}but I thought it might be nice to spend time with him...

920
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:49,250
不用偷偷摸摸  你觉得呢
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}and not have to sneak around. What do you think?

921
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,190
你应该去
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You should go.

922
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:57,170
真的吗  这段时间很忙  艾米要办婚礼
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Really? I mean, it's a hectic time, with Amy's wedding,

923
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:58,940
-还有画廊的事  -听着
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}- and the gallery... - Listen, listen.

924
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,370
我这辈子都在推迟
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I have spent my entire life putting off things

925
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,760
我以为之后会有时间再做的事
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}that I thought there'd be time for later.

926
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,870
敞开的门不会永远敞开
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Open doors don't stay open forever.

927
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,640
请你去吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}So please... go.

928
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,060
你不会有事吧
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}You'll be okay?

929
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,370
我会很开心的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll be delightful.

930
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,370
当然了
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}I'll bet.

931
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,090
看看那些花  赫克托肯定很浪漫
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Judging from those flowers, Hector must be smitten.

932
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,130
是的
{\fn微软雅黑}{\b0}{\fs14}{\3c&H202020&}{\shad1}Yes.
