<i>Previously on</i> Why Women Kill..

00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,137
You can cheat on your wife
all you want,

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,763
but you're not
touching mine.

4
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,432
I am in love with you.

5
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:17,225
ROB: You knew the rules.
I will never...

6
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,560
leave my wife.

7
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,103
(sighs)
So I can tell Rob is still mad

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,104
about the other night.

9
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,564
He hasn't called in days.

10
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,734
Why would he even be with me
if he was so happy with her?

11
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,318
BETH ANN: <i>Maybe she did
something to hurt him</i>

12
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>and he needs time
to forgive her.</i>

13
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,281
This project
I've been involved with,

14
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,283
it's almost over.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,242
Every night.

16
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,327
SIMONE:
It's Hector.

17
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,121
He was the best hairdresser
I ever had.

18
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:41,124
I've known for some time
about Karl's indiscretions.

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:45,420
I saw his car parked
at some seedy motel.

20
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,963
(gasps)

21
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,257
What in God's name?

22
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,633
We haven't seen each
other in years.

23
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,635
Hector was the only person

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,596
who ever saw me
for the man I truly am.

25
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,849
Stop romanticizing
your grubby little fling.

26
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,267
Do you love him?

27
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,643
I do.

28
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,811
- Hey.
- Hmm?

29
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:02,979
You fell asleep.

30
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,439
- Take this.
- Uh...

31
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,565
I don't think I should.

TAYLOR:
<i>While I was away,</i>

33
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,027
did you two fuck?

34
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,030
- (chuckles nervously)
- We absolutely fucked.

35
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,239
TAYLOR:
Okay.

36
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,491
This was bound to happen, right?

37
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,826
Since we're
all together now.

38
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,495
All right, let's talk
about my script.

39
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,872
I'm expecting offers in
the high six-figure range.

40
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,040
(exhales)

41
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,334
Be good to Jade.
She's your muse.

42
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,669
His muse?
I am the one who spent

43
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,590
the last two years cleaning up
the mess he made of our lives.

44
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,383
- What did he do?
- What didn't he do?

45
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,885
Speed, cocaine.

46
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,970
He's an addict.

47
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,139
One of the producers
wants a rewrite.

48
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,725
And if I can get it to them
on time, then... I'm back.

49
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,311
And the money that will follow,
Jade, I can take care of you.

for meeting me.

a little surprised

to get your text.

Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry about that.

I know I kind of
disappeared there.

105
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,699
Yeah. Thought maybe you had,
uh, found someone else.

106
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,076
No, no, nothing like that.
I just, you know...

107

Took a different path
for a while.

- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

All right, Tanya,

110
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,207
listen to me.

111
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,543
You're gonna go play
with your friends while Mommy

- In my head, I still think of her

- as a baby.
- Yeah, well,

120

00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,452
just fell off the back of a

We need to talk.

145

Bloody hell,
it's 7:00 in the morning.

146
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,044
I was so angry
with you last night.

147
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,629
The way you spoke to me.

148
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,505
Look, Simone...

149
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,132
I was up all night
thinking to myself,

150
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,469
"I wish I'd never
married that man.

151
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,721
He's stolen the last
ten years of my life."

152
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,264
All right, I'm sorry.

153
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,683
Here, put that on.

154
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,352
Why?

155
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,812
Just do it.

156
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,730
All right.

157
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,485
Then I started thinking
about our time together.

158
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,696
You taught me how to ski...

159
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,325
...how to tango.
(chuckles)

160
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,619
Hmm. How to speak French.

161
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,665
Asking for more chardonnay
is not really speaking French.

162
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,875
(laughs)
Most importantly,

163
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,670
you taught me how
to laugh at myself.

164
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,842
The truth is, you haven't
stolen anything from me.

165
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,177
If anything,

166
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,971
you've given me more
than I deserved.

167
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:14,183
I'm sorry, the suspense is
slightly killing me now.

168
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,018
Where is this going?

169
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,563
Follow me.

170
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,817
Just to be clear, I still think
we should get a divorce.

171
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,777
Uh, yes, I assumed as much.

172
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,196
But just because I can't
have you as a husband

173
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,073
doesn't mean I can't
have you as a friend.

174
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,576
And I do like to
keep my friends happy.

175
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,914
Hector.

176
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,791
Hello, Karl.

177
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:46,257
I have never loved you more
than I do in this moment.

178
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,385
Please, Karl, not in front
of the boyfriend.

179
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,850
(Hector laughing)

180
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,399
Hello.

181
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,735
Sheila.

182
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,404
Your apartment manager told me
you were down here.

183
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:10,239
- I was hoping we could get lunch.
- Ugh.

184
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Sorry, I just got
called into work.

185
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,576
Two waitresses are sick.

186
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,203
I have to clean my uniform
and get over to Glendale.

187
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,455
It's fine.
We can catch up another time.

188
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,248
Well, there's certainly
a lot to catch up on.

189
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,709
- Has something happened?
- (groans)

190
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,504
Mrs. Persky...

191
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,925
I need you to leave.

192
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,051
Why?

193
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,427
I need to talk
to my friend.

194
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,720
What about?

195
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,930
It's private.

196
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,933
So sex, huh?

197
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,018
Just go!

198
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,275
You seem irritable.

199
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,446
(quietly):
Rob dumped me.

200
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,740
He did?

201
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,742
Yeah, he sent roses
with a note

202
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:58,246
saying, "I can't keep seeing
you, please forgive me."

203
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,958
Oh, well, you knew
this day was coming.

204
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,626
Yeah. I just thought
he would be man enough

205
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,586
to tell me to my face.

206
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,965
You know, I phoned him at his
work yesterday ten times.

207
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,384
His secretary, Claire,
won't put me through.

208
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,969
Well, honey,
it is time to move on.

209
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:14,845
- You don't want to embarrass yourself.
- Well...

210
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,722
Yeah.

211
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,144
(sighs)
What are you doing back here?

212
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,479
I brought my husband.

213
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,147
I want him to see
how you talk to me.

214
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,358
I should go.
I'll call you later.

215
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,985
- Thanks.
- Sorry...

216
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,196
Aw, why the long face?

217
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,739
Did your fella dump you?

218
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,660
Your wife is a horrible person.
Do you know that?

219
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,288
Yeah, I'm aware.

220
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:45,459
I thought we were excited
about the offer.

221
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,794
(sniffs)

222
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,546
No, no.

223
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,048
Look, of-of course I trust you.

224
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,175
Yeah. I mean,
do your thing. Okay.

225
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,385
All right, bye.
(sniffs)

226
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,554
Oh, shit.

227
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,181
(sniffs, clears throat)

228
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,349
Is everything all right?

229
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:04,186
Hey. Uh, yes.

230
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,522
Yeah, there's-there's an offer
on the table for the script.

231
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:09,150
But Lamar wants to hold out
for more money,

232
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,818
which, you know,
makes me kind of nervous.

233
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,195
(sniffing)

234
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,905
What are you on right now?

235
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,200
What? Nothing.

236
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,202
Oh, yeah? Then
what's this, then?

237
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,163
(sniffing)
Hmm?

238
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,874
It-it...
it's a heavy pollen year.

239
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,500
Dude...

240
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,877
It's been on the news.

241
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,378
We are on the same team.

242
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,006
I cannot cover for you if you're
gonna be stupid about it.

243
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,844
All right, I'm sorry.

244
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,554
The addy wasn't cutting it
for me anymore,

245
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:40,056
so I just... I needed something
a little bit stronger.

246
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,017
Why? The script is done.

247
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,560
TAYLOR:
Guys?

248
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,228
(sniffs)
Yeah, we're in here.

249
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,772
(quietly): Get your hand
out of your face.

250
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,231
- All right.
- Sorry.

251
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,566
- Hey.
- Hi.

252
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,901
I need to talk to you both.

253
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,028
- Yeah, what's on your mind?
- Look,

254
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,031
I know I said I was okay with
what went on with you two,

255
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,866
but clearly, I wasn't.

256
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,202
I felt like I went away
for the night, and you two

257
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,871
had suddenly become
this little team without me.

258
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,082
And it's not fair
to blame you,

259
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,708
because I'm the reason
we're all together

260
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,584
in the first place.

261
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,252
I just feel like
I talked you into this

262
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,755
with absolutely no idea of
how we would make it work.

263
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,715
Well, that's okay.

264
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,551
- Yeah. I mean, we will figure it out.
- We will.

265
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,303
But we're gonna need some help,
and I think I found

266
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:20,596
just the place to start.

267
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,811
JADE: "Amour the Merrier
Events, Limited"?

268
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,062
ELI:
Events?

269
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,605
You want us to
go to an orgy?

270
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:30,940
Oh, it's not an orgy.

271
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,566
It's a polyamory retreat.

272
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,985
Isn't that just a fancy
way of saying "orgy"?

273
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,112
Stop saying orgy.

274
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,780
- All right.
- This is a three-day event

275
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,615
at a hotel in San Diego.

276
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,992
- (sniffs)
- They have workshops, lectures, all designed

277
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,120
to help people who are new
to the polyamorous lifestyle.

278
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,121
- (sniffs)
- The whole thing is designed

279
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,289
by experts who know how to
make a relationship

280
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,291
- like ours work.
- (sniffs)

281
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,793
Oh, look, so here's
one of the seminars.

282
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,586
"Negotiating Boundaries
and Polyamorous

283
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,922
Relationship Agreements."

284
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,633
- Doesn't that sound helpful?
- Yeah, it really does.

285
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,968
- Um, let me... let me see.
- See?

286
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,428
So, I'll go make
the reservations.

287
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,805
- We'll leave tomorrow.
- All right.

288
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,807
- Yeah, wonderful. - Yeah.
- Yep.

289
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,100
(sniffling)

290
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,144
You okay, babe?

291
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,313
Yeah, yeah, just,
you know, allergies. Oof.

292
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,274
It is a heavy pollen year.

293
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,986
It was on the news.

294
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,737
Huh.

295
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,620
- (yelps, laughs)
- (laughing)

296
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,205
Here comes the bubbly.

297
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,207
Pour like there's
no tomorrow.

298
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,169
You are getting
your husband back.

299
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,879
I'm so happy.

300
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,589
Of course,
I feel bad for April.

301
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,966
Why? She should've known
what was coming.

302
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,301
This is how the movie

303
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,553
always ends: the man
slinks back to his wife,

304
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:45,097
and the whore ends up drunk
and alone.

305
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,183
Actually,
now that I got four kids,

306
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,809
it doesn't sound so bad.

307
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,019
(chuckles softly)

308
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,855
I was thinking of taking April
to a restaurant next week.

309
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,857
You know, to cheer her up.

310
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,692
Beth Ann, the war is over.

311
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,196
You won. Let the enemy
limp away in defeat.

312
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,656
April and I grew very close
these last few weeks.

313
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,241
It's a true friendship.

314
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
She thinks your name is Sheila.

315
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,205
- I admit, it's a complicated...
- (car door closes)

316
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,376
Honey! What's wrong?

317
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,878
April is in my driveway.

318
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,383
(gasps)
Shit.

319
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,511
(quietly):
What is she doing here?

320
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,054
Why the fuck
should I know?

321
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,305
We can't open the door.

322
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,556
I think we're
gonna have to.

323
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,849
I think she saw me.

324
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,519
You have to be me.

325
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,895
Are you crazy?

326
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,563
Please. I'm begging.

327
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,232
- Fine.
- (exhales)

328
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,441
Christ on a cracker.

329
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,609
Don't swear.

330
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,778
And be nice.

331
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,112
(doorbell rings)

332
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,408
(neutral accent):
May I help you?

333
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,370
Are you Mrs. Robert Stanton?

334
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,412
Yes.

335
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,581
And who might you be,
pray tell?

336
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,250
I'm April.

337
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,586
I'm... a-a waitress at
Jansen's Diner in Glendale.

338
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,755
Your husband is one
of my regulars.

339
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,257
Is he?

340
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,925
Yes.

341
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,718
Um...

342
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,720
I don't mean to rush you, dear,

343
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:10,432
but I have curtains to hem
and croutons in the oven.

344
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,601
APRIL:
Yes, I just wanted

345
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,229
to come by to say that I think
your husband might have left

346
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,939
his coat at the diner.

347
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,567
Well, mercy me.

348
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,444
APRIL: (chuckles)
I-I'm not even sure

349
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,113
if it's his, but...

350
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,282
if you wouldn't mind just
telling him that I stopped by

351
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,825
and asking him to call me.

352
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,827
(Brooklyn accent):
He knows your number...

353
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,453
(neutral accent):
number?

354
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,622
At the diner.

355
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,708
He could just give me
a call at the diner.

356
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,293
I'll tell him.

357
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,836
- Bye now.
- Goodbye.

358
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,131
I have never said "mercy me."

359
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,841
But you do bake
your own croutons.

360
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,343
I can't believe April
actually came to the house.

361
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,470
Got to say,
I'm impressed.

362
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,681
That tramp, she ain't going down
without a fight.

363
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,100
Well, this tramp isn't either.

364
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,729
You know what I mean.

365
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,316
I have to leave in ten minutes,
and I have got

366
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,359
absolutely no idea
what to wear.

367
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,194
You're so cute,
all aflutter

368
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,155
over your dinner
with your new beau.

369
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,115
Is this pastel too gay?

370
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,825
Have you ever seen
a straight pastel?

371
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:12,911
(scoffs) Will you please put
the paper down and help me?

372
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,122
I'm trying to find a nice
place for you to live.

373
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,292
Oh, what about a condo
at Sanford Palms?

374
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,793
Sanford Palms?

375
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,713
That's only about five blocks
away from here.

376
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,006
Well, I still want us
to have our movie nights.

377
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,090
You wouldn't have to drive home

378
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,508
after cocktails.

379
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,927
Our friends are going
to despise us.

380
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,887
Why?

381
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,180
When people split up,

382
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,183
they prefer venom
and fireworks,

383
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,809
tears and accusations.

384
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,519
So childish
and petty.

385
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,563
- Besides, we did that last week.
- Right.

386
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,023
I've narrowed it down
to these two.

387
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,024
Which do you prefer?

388
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,317
The linen.

389
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,318
Are you sure?

390
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,028
Why do you care
which suit?

391
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,279
How long is it gonna be on,
really?

392
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,574
(Cockney accent):
Oi! I'm a good girl, I am.

393
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,326
I don't let
no gentleman touch me

394
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,495
what ain't
bought me lobster first.

395
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,497
- (doorbell rings)
- (laughs) Oh, that's Tommy.

396
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,831
Don't do Eliza for him.

397
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
He won't understand
the reference,

398
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,834
and he'll think
you're having a stroke.

399
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,337
Yes. Much humor is lost
on the younger generation.

400
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,463
Trousers!

401
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,385
Tommy. Come in.

402
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,719
Where's Mr. Grove?

403
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,596
He has a date
tonight.

404
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,348
With a guy?

405
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,724
Yes.

406
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,435
I've lost a husband, but
I've gained a gay sidekick.

407
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,436
I'm glad.

408
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,813
Because now...

409
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,940
we don't have to hide
when we do this.

410
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,526
Mmm.

411
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,529
(hisses) I'm feeling
something interesting.

412
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,905
Can you blame me?

413
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,158
Not down there... up here.

414
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,203
Oh! Is this for me?

415
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,414
I was saving that
for after dinner.

416
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,665
Do you think you can wait?

417
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,084
What a question.

418
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,086
Of course not.

419
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,171
(gasps)

420
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
It's stunning.

421
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,384
Your taste is improving.

422
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,760
Mm.

423
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,595
A woman like you
deserves the best.

424
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,932
And I-I want you to see
that I can give that to you.

425
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,226
KARL:
Tommy!

426
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,979
He hasn't left yet?

427
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,231
Thank God
I caught you.

428
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,274
I need fresh eyes
on an outfit.

429
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,443
Uh, Simone
prefers the linen,

430
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,445
but I think the navy's
more slimming.

431
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,654
Thoughts?

432
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,614
Y-You're not fat.

433
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,783
Yes. As a straight man,
I am boyishly slim.

434
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,536
However, as a homo, I could
afford to lose a few. So...

435
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,329
See what Tommy
gave me.

436
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,456
Ooh.

437
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,832
Hark at you.

438
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,584
Diamond Jim Brady Bunch.

439
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,335
Anyway,

440
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,462
which one?

441
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,671
Just pick one.

442
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,964
Navy.

443
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,424
Navy it is.
Thank you.

444
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,469
(exhales) I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt,

445
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,970
but, as you know,

446
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,431
it's very important
to get the costume right

447
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,183
when you're coming out.

448
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,895
We don't care if you come out,
just as long as you get out.

449
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,313
I can always take a subtle hint,
Simone.

450
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,315
Perhaps, one day,
you'll give me one.

451
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,275
Oh, tell Hector you
won't sleep with him

452
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,277
unless he does my hair
for the wedding!

453
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,737
You got it! Goodbye!

454
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,700
You have
a very interesting marriage.

455
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,873
Sheila.

456
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,833
Um, what are you doing here?

457
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,169
Our visit was cut short
yesterday, so I just...

458
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,338
Now's not really a good time;
I'm feeling under the weather.

459
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,465
Do you want me to run
to the drugstore for you?

460
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,841
Oh, no, no. I just...

461
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,468
need a couple of aspirin.

462
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,178
Sit. I'll get them for you.

463
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,638
Oh, you don't
have to do that.

464
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,806
It's no trouble.

465
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,475
Besides,
I have some good news.

466
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,685
Oh. That's nice.

467
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,021
I could use some.

468
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,773
I've found you a man.

469
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
His name's Eldon Ratzinger.

470
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,070
Eldon Ratzinger.

471
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,905
He's my butcher. Very nice.

472
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,865
On the short side,
but you wouldn't notice

473
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,700
if you're wearing flats.

474
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,035
Thanks, but...

475
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,871
I can't meet anyone for a while.

476
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,749
You won't forget about Rob
if you sit around pouting.

477
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,086
Trust me, I won't be forgetting
about Rob anytime soon.

478
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,587
- (water running)
- You've got to get over this obsession

479

535
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,769
So I got you bears.

536
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh.

537
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:54,938
Thank you.

538
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,314
What are you doing in the trunk?

539
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,026
Uh, looking for my baseball cap.

540
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:00,736
Ah. So, where is it?

541
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,738
Forgot to pack it.

542
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,197
Fuckin' Eli.

543
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,699
- (chuckles)
- All right.

544
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,284
Let's hit the road.

545
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,748
Darling, is there any chance
you can watch the gallery

546
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:13,915
for me this morning?

547
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,125
Where will you be?

548
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,460
Uh, I have an
appointment.

549
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,086
Oh.

550
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,213
And would this appointment
involve

551
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,798
your new boyfriend Hector?

552
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,885
He may tag along, yes.

553
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,471
(gasps)
Look at you, proud gay man.

554
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,264
You know I'd do anything
to support you.

555
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:32,893
Short of canceling
my training session at the gym.

556
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:35,479
Are you sure
<i>you're</i> not a gay man?

557
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,565
(gasps)
Naomi.

558
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,734
I thought we were meeting
at the club.

559
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,735
You never know
who's eavesdropping there.

560
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,654
And what I have to say
is for your ears only.

561
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,990
Mm. Hello, Naomi.

562
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,784
My ears and I
were just leaving.

563
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,910
Thank you.

564
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,247
You seem upset.

565
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,584
Remember when I told you
that Tommy was hiding something?

566
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,296
I know his secret.

567
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,632
You do?

568
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,926
He's on drugs.

569
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh, thank God.

570
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,598
That you finally figured it out.

571
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,975
It's the only thing that
makes sense... the secrecy,

572
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,104
the long hours, the lock
on his bedroom door.

573
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,481
Not to mention
the missing money.

574
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,690
What money?

575
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,318
He cashed in
his savings bond.

576
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,278
They became his
when he turned 18.

577
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,280
And I'm not supposed
to know,

578
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,449
but my friend
at the bank tipped me off.

579
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,701
I ask you, Simone,

580
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,996
what else could he have bought
that cost $10,000?

581
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,916
He spent $10,000?

582
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,000
(gasps)

583
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,920
I knew you'd understand.

584
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:43,964
Oh.

585
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,424
You're such a good friend.

586
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:50,137
I know we've had
our squabbles.

587
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,304
But in a crisis like this,

588
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:54,266
there is no one else
I can turn to.

589
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,852
No one?

590
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,312
What do you think
he's doing?

591
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,523
- Heroin?
- (scoffs)

592
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,983
This is Tommy
we're talking about.

593
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,860
I seriously doubt
he's on heroin.

594
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,528
What? That's a beautiful brooch.

595
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,821
Is it new?

596
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,948
Then again, it could be heroin.

597
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,994
All right.

598
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,663
- Oh, look at this place. It's cute.
- Yeah.

599
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,000
Here we go, come on.

600
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,084
- TAYLOR: Oh...
- ELI: Oh, man.

601
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,211
JADE: Why are they
stopping everyone?

602
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,005
Who knows?
(laughs softly)

603
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,215
Look at all these cars.

604
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,842
Who knew polyamory
was so popular?

605
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,261
(both laugh)

606
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,638
Oh, my God.

607
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,725
Vice President Pence
is speaking here tonight.

608
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,560
- At a polyamory seminar?
- (laughs)

609
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:39,769
- That's surprising.
- Odd choice.

610
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,229
No.
(chuckles)

611
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,439
He's in a different ballroom.

612
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,275
He's talking
to "local Republicans."

613
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,444
- Oh...
- Ugh. Well, that's the reason for the holdup.

614
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:49,571
It's extra security.

615
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:53,575
Oh, security...

616
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,706
(exhales)

617
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:01,082
They're opening
people's trunks.

618
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,918
That's gonna take forever.

619
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,711
(indistinct chatter)

620
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,922
Um...

621
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,761
- (Taylor sighs)
- You know what, guys?

622
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,223
- Uh, we-we, we need to turn around. Yeah.
- What?

623
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,934
- Why?
- Uh... I-I got to, I got to pee, guys. I'm so sorry.

624
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,602
- I just...
- No, honey, I was kidding.

625
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,229
The hotel is just
up the street.

626
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,563
- We'll be there in, like...
- Nope.

627
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,732
(straining): Can't do it. Dam's
gonna burst. Here-here we go...

628
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,651
TAYLOR: No, honey, wait,
what are you doing? What are you doing?

629
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:28,777
- Oh!
- I'm flipping a bitch.

630
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,403
TAYLOR:
Wait... Eli, what...

631
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,363
You can't make a U-turn here.

632
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,489
Yeah, well, now it's turning

633
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,740
into a bit more
of a three-point thing.

634
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,993
- TAYLOR: Eli...
- JADE: Eli, no!

635
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:37,953
- Or four.
- Oh, my God!

636
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,871
JADE:
Eli! Stop!

637
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,957
Oh, my God.

638
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,750
JADE:
Eli, what are you doing?

639
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,294
They're gonna think that
we're terrorists or something.

640
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,171
- (thumping)
- Five.

641
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,881
See that? Smooth sailing.

642
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,800
- Have you lost your fucking mind? Jesus...
- Smooth sailing.

643
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,134
(horn honking)

644
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,344
Eli, slow down!

645
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,679
You're gonna get us all killed.

646
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,138
ELI: Oh, wha... everyone,
just calm down, okay?

647
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,682
There's a Taco Bell
a couple miles down the road.

648
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,100
Right? We'll stop there,
it's gonna be fine.

649
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,143
All right?
Everything is gonna be fine.

650
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,354
(sniffles)

651
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,609
What?

652
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,488
Stop the car. Now.

653
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,032
(groans softly)
All right.

654
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,957
(beeps)

655
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,792
What... Why are you
opening the trunk?

656
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,877
Because I want to know
what's in there.

657
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,921
- Taylor!
- (door closes)

658
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,509
Shit.

659
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,177
Eli, your nose.

660
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,179
Oh...

661
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,307
Fuck.

662
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,766
Wait.

663
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,522
(chuckles softly)

664
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,859
Oh, my God. Eli.

665
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,861
I-I know that it looks bad.

666
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,071
Get in the car.
We're going home.

667
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,656
W-What about the retreat?

668
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,034
Oh, fuck the retreat.

669
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,661
(sighs, mutters)

670
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,373
(door closes)

671
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,884
SHEILA:
Pregnant? Jesus.

672
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,220
She's not only a tramp,
she's a stupid tramp.

673
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:21,431
- I don't want to drink right now.
- Oh, honey.

674
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,601
This is all for me.
I find your life very stressful.

675
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:28,521
At least we know why April was
so desperate to speak to Rob.

676
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,567
How do you think he'll react?

677
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,029
I think he will be thrilled.

678
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,406
Really?

679
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,910
Rob loved being a father.

680
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:47,082
When we lost Emily...
that was our daughter's name...

681
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,292
That's a beautiful name.

682
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,090
When we lost Emily,
he couldn't accept it.

683
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,509
Rob begged me
to have another child.

684
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,594
Why didn't you?

685
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:03,765
We tried and tried, but...

686
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,434
Did you ever think
about adoption?

687
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,603
Rob said he didn't want
to raise another man's baby.

688
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:10,271
He wanted a child

689
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,648
of his own.

690
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,108
(inhales)

691
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,485
And now he's going to get one.

692
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,904
God, I hate this guy.

693
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,907
Ugh, please,
he's still my husband.

694
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,620
What do I do now?

695
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,623
Come clean.

696
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,834
Tell him you know about
the affair, and the baby.

697
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,795
- No.
- It's time to put it all on the table.

698
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:34,963
But how will that help?

699
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,339
It will force him

700
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,799
to make a choice.

701
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,802
You or her.

702
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:45,181
What if... he doesn't choose me?

703
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:47,809
Well, then you'll finally hate
the fucking bastard

704
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,019
just as much as I do.

705
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,319
No, I won't. That's the problem.

706
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:02,782
Look, I don't know
what he's gonna do.

707
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,826
Maybe he'll choose you.

708
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,287
But whatever happens,

709
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,081
aren't you done
with all the lies?

710
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,670
Oh...

711
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,970
COACH:
Okay, team, let's go. Heads up!

712
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,306
Defense, north side
of the field.

713
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:29,934
Offense, south side.
Let's go...

714
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,191
Hey. What are you doing here?

715
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,485
Why didn't you tell me
these diamonds were real?

716
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:41,321
Yea... of course they're real.
I thought you knew that.

717
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,739
Well, I didn't. Take this back.

718
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,240
No. Why would I do that?

719
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,159
The bank told your mother
you sold a bond.

720
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,369
She now thinks you're on drugs,
and knowing

721
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,705
what you spent on this,
I'm wondering if she's right.

722
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,207
- I'm not taking it back.
- Tommy.

723
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,417
I should be able to buy diamonds
for the woman I love.

724
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,922
Relax. I don't expect you
to say it back.

725
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,382
I gave you that so you'd see
that I'm not just some kid

726
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,009
who can't play in your league.

727
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,386
The diamonds are real
because my feelings are.

728
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,098
You know I adore you,

729
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,227
but I just don't see how we can
have that kind of relationship.

730
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,229
Because of what people
would say?

731
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,523
- They'd be brutal.
- So, you're not embarrassed

732
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,399
that Karl dates men,
but you are embarrassed by me?

733
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,943
I am not embarrassed at all.

734
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,195
- (footsteps approaching)
- (gasps) Oh, dear God.

735
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,740
Hey, Tommy!
Who's your girlfriend?

736
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,575
I-I can't stay here.

737
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,245
- Here, take this, please.
- TOMMY: No.

738
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,915
It's yours.
I'm not ashamed to love you.

739
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,764
- Taylor...
- Don't.

740
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,642
I need for no one
to speak right now.

741
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,738
How long?

742
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,450
Sorry?

743
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,704
How long have you
been using again?

744
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,915
Not that long.

745
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,917
- I mean, it started...
- Don't tell me.

746
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,794
I don't want to know how long
I missed the signs.

747
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:21,254
How long this has been happening

748
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,339
right in front
of my own stupid face.

749
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,133
Babe, please, you...

750
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:27,135
You... shut up.

751
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,138
I was distracted before.

752
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,349
You'd better believe my eyes
are wide fucking open now.

753
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:51,159
(phone ringing)

754
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,327
Hello?

755
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,704
Tommy's dealing drugs.

756
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,623
What?

757
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,541
Kay Randall's son Bradley

758
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,670
saw him today with a customer.

759
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,339
A customer?

760
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,217
He saw him making a deal
in the middle of P.E.

761
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,803
with some seedy,
middle-aged woman

762
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,640
- in dark glasses.
- Middle-aged?

763
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,016
Anyway,

764
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,018
do you have a screwdriver?

765
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,145
I want to break
into Tommy's room.

766
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,064
Why? I'm sure he doesn't keep
drugs in there.

767
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,483
Maybe not, but at least
I could read his journal.

768
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,486
His journal?

769
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,655
I think I found one.

770
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,907
W-Well, what do you mean,
he keeps a journal?

771
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,867
I-I have to go.

772
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,745
- Naomi. Uh...
- (dial tone)

773
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,627
(tires screeching)

774
00:32:57,975 --> 00:33:00,353
- Naomi?
- NAOMI: Up here!

775
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,481
(grunts)

776
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,072
Naomi.

777
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,241
I'm so glad you're here.
You can help me look.

778
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,035
I am only here to stop you
from making an awful mistake.

779
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,413
If Tommy finds out
you read his journal,

780
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:19,747
you could lose him forever.

781
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,916
He won't find out.
He's at track until 6:00.

782
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:23,918
You trashed his room. You won't
have time to clean it up.

783
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,878
And the journal
may not even be here.

784
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,922
- Found it.
- (gasps)

785
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:29,424
Simone.

786
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,092
When Amy was ten,
I read her diary.

787
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,885
She didn't speak to me
for a year.

788
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,930
- Hand it over.
- If she had been Tommy's age,

789
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,724
she'd have moved out.

790
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,976
Do you really want to risk that,
just to get an intrusive look

791
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,979
at Tommy's most
private thoughts and...

792
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,939
- Jesus Christ. Nothing!
- What?

793
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:46,607
- Give me that.
- (gasps)

794
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,735
As your friend, I am
begging you, don't read that.

795
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,862
Why are you so emotional?

796
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,699
Karl is gay.

797
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:57,994
- What?
- He sleeps with men.

798
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,371
Uh... can we just focus
on my problems for a moment?

799
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,497
No wonder you're so distraught.

800
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,124
I mean,
I wanted to tell you,

801
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,626
but then I thought,
"No, Naomi has her own problems.

802
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,837
She doesn't want to hear
my tawdry tale."

803
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,714
Oh, but I do.

804
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,645
NAOMI:
<i>You mean to tell me</i>

805
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,773
that when I saw Karl's
car at the motel,

806
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,317
he was there with a man?

807
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,819
I can't talk about this
without a drink.

808
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,279
Maybe we could
go downstairs and,

809
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,614
you know,
open up a bottle?

810
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,324
Of course.
But how did you find out?

811
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,326
Did you catch him with
one of his lovers?

812
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,786
SIMONE: No, it was Wanda.
You were right.

813
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,204
She despises me.

814
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,955
- She found out...
- What are you doing in my room?

815
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,837
Is that my journal?

816
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,672
Uh, she just found it,

817
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,466
but she hasn't read it yet.

818
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,052
I'm so sorry, Tommy.

819
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,387
I just wanted to make sure
that you weren't doing drugs.

820
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:01,015
So you broke into my room?

821
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:03,184
Well, you've been
so distant lately.

822
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,020
Mrs. Grove,
if you wouldn't mind...

823
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:09,482
Yes, I should go, as this
doesn't involve me at all.

824
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,445
Jesus. Mom...

825
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,866
(scoffs)

826
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,537
You looking for these?

827
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,997
Oh, good, you found them.
Thank you.

828
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,207
How'd it go in there?

829
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,000
Eh, just told Mom
that I'm gonna

830
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,837
cash in another bond so I can
hike through Europe this summer.

831
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,213
She felt so guilty
about breaking

832
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,881
into my room that she agreed.

833
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,551
You turned the situation
to your advantage.

834
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,094
Good for you.

835
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:43,891
I, uh, leave for Paris
two days after graduation.

836
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,018
Care to join me?

837
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,938
Are you crazy?

838
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,648
We don't have to leave
at the same time.

839
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,567
I'll go first,
then you take a vacation

840
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,693
and meet me there.

841
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,779
No one's gonna know
that we're together.

842
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,030
Your mother's watching.

843
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,494
That is why we
need to do this.

844
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,538
Someone is <i>always</i>
watching us here.

845
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,082
We will never know who we can be
as a couple until we get away

846
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,500
from my mom, your friends,

847
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,919
and everyone else whose
opinions you're scared of.

848
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,967
Can I think about it?

849
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,803
Sure.

850
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,196
(exhales)

851
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,413
Wow.

852
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,790
Look at this.

853
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,792
Someone went to
a lot of trouble.

854
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,419
Oh, not so much.

855
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,047
I just put out a few flowers,
and the good silver,

856
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,632
and the candlesticks
your mother bought us.

857
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,509
Would you like a mai tai
before dinner?

858
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,137
You made mai tais?
(chuckles)

859
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,764
Hold it.
Did you wreck the car?

860
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,807
Why would you think that?

861
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,769
You only make mai tais
before giving me bad news.

862
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,354
- That's silly.
- Huh.

863
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,647
Now drink your mai tai.

864
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,819

865
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,905

(exhales)

867
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,840
Where do you think you're going?

868
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,009
Upstairs.

869
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,469
Not alone, you're not.

870
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,637
In fact, this is what's

871
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,972
gonna happen right now.

872
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,974
You and I are gonna
take a tour of this house,

873
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,059
and you're gonna show me where
you've been hiding your stash.

874
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,355
- There's no stash. I just...
- And you know what, Eli,

875
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,731
put all that shit down,

876
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,858
because you have absolutely
no reason to unpack.

877
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,444
You're going to rehab
first thing in the morning.

878
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,363
Are you kidding? Rehab?

879
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,531
Come on.

880
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,658
I want your wallet.
And your phone.

881
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,368
You are cut off.

882
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:11,539
No cash, no cards,
no PayPal, no Venmo.

883
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,457
Do you understand?

884
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,505
You know, I understand
why you're upset,

885
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,673
but you don't have to
humiliate me

886
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,008
- in front of Jade, too.
- Wrong.

887
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,926
You should be humiliated.

888
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,053
After what we went through
last time,

889
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,097
the idea that you would even
put us through this again...

890
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,724
(phone ringing)

891
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,225
- Eli, give it to me.
- It's Lamar.

892
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,560
- He'll leave a message.
- Just... It could be

893
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,728
about the script.
Just...

894
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,688
please let me
take the call.

895
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,606
- (ringing continues)
- Fine.

896
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,735
Stay where I can see you.

897
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,777
Hey.

898
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,905
- Yeah...
- Tay...

899
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,616
I want to help.
Just tell me what I can do.

900
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,868
ELI:
How much?

901
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,330
- Just... be with me.
- ELI: Yeah.

902
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,416
Back me up. This is
gonna be really hard.

903
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,251
But it's the only way.

904
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,920
Hey, you got it. Of course.

905
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,839
ELI:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

906
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,091
(phone beeps)

907
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,720
What did Lamar say?

908
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:11,265
He-he was able to start
a bidding war...

909
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,227
...and he sold it for a lot more
than we expected.

910
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:17,063
How much more?

911
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,731
One-point-two.

912
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,608
- One-point-two?
- Million.

913
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,902
(chuckling):
1.2 million.

914
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,404
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

915
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,822
Oh, my God.

916
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,157
JADE:
Oh, my God!

917
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,452
- (chuckling)
- Are you serious? Oh, my God.

918
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,580
- Eli, congratulations.
- Oh, my God, thank you. Thank you.

919
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,415
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

920
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,792
Honey, this is
such great news, okay?

921
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,585
Your career
is back again.

922
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,921
This is all the more reason
to get you to rehab.

923
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,925
(chuckling):
You-you know what?

924
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,843
I-I don't, I don't think
it's the best time for me,

925
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:48,886
right now.

926
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:52,765
Buddy... you don't really
have a choice here.

927
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,477
I just sold a script
for $1.2 million.

928
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,979
You know? I think
I got a lot of fucking choices.

929
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:02,691
Eli... I am not gonna stand by
and watch you kill yourself.

930
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,986
Oh, God.
Come on.

931
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,863
This is not like
last time, all right?

932
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,824
- I'm in a completely better place now.
- Eli!

933
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,701
This is nonnegotiable.

934
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,203
- Taylor...
- Do you know what...?

935
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,664
You're so fucking desperate
to control me, aren't you?

936
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,165
- I mean, it's fucking pathetic!
- Okay. No, Eli,

937
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,293
- this is the drugs talking. You know that, right?
- No. No. No, it's not.

938
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,004
This is me, okay? I am clear
as a fucking bell right now.

939
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:27,633
And from now on...
I make my own decisions.

940
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,845
Okay, Eli.
Well, here's one for you:

941
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:35,391
either you go to rehab,
or I walk out that fucking door!

942
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,184
- Whoa. Hold on. Hold on.
- Really?

943
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,853
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Really? You just walk on out?

944
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:42,022
- If you push me, yeah.
- Okay. Well, Taylor,

945
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,191
you know, I really
wish you wouldn't go.

946
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:47,486
But if you want to,
that's your choice.

947
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,741
See? I would never force
you to do anything.

948
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,996
Come on, Jade.

949
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,169
Jade...

950
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,883
I... I think maybe
we shouldn't go.

951
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,929
- You what?
- Eli needs help.

952
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,599
I think maybe the best way
to help him is to

953
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,852
stay here and-and,
you know,

954
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,062
just keep
an eye on him.

955
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:24,607
You're choosing him.

956
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,401
I'm choosing us.
I'm choosing all of us.

957
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:31,405
Fuck you.
Fuck you both.

960
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:48,214
I can't believe
you made peach cobbler.

961
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,925
- I know it's your favorite.
- Mmm.

962
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,677
You must've been
cooking since noon.

963
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,638
I didn't start
all that early.

964
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,516
Well, thanks for this.
It was a beautiful night.

965
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,145
You're welcome.

966
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,733

967
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,443

Robert?

969
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:14,949
And you're calling me Robert?
Ah, this is gonna be bad, huh?

970
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,117
We definitely need
to have a talk.

971
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,953
Ah, boy.

972
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,538
First...

973
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,415

...I love you so much.

975
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,422
- Mm.
- And more importantly,

976
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:35,094
I love us.
And the life we've had.

977
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,263

he cashed in one of his
