1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,568
What Salamanca is planning?

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,270
I don't want to lie to my client.

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,771
You're talking about the fridge guy?

4
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,197
I mean all my clients.

5
00:00:07,199 --> 00:00:09,625
Your friend, um... "Krazy-8"?

6
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:11,277
Has he ever been inside before?

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,795
He'll keep his mouth shut.

8
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,447
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,540
Mr. Varga, long time no see.

10
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,242
Get in.

11
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,129

12
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:53,482
Okay.

13
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:02,341
♪ Y mi para un hombre enamorado ♪

14
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:04,100
♪ Da-da-da ♪

15
00:04:04,102 --> 00:04:08,104

16
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:11,350
♪ Paca paca paca paca en mi caballo ♪

17
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,902
Can I talk?

18
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:50,939
I-I-I'll talk.

19
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,743
I have a feeling I
know what this is about.

20
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,820
J-Just to get the ball rolling,

21
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,747
please keep in mind

22
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,007
that whatever happened

23
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,401
between Mr. Varga and myself,

24
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,920
I'm hoping that it's just
water under the bridge.

25
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:07,163
'Cause after all was said and done,

26
00:05:07,165 --> 00:05:09,165
you did walk out a free man.

27
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:12,427
I mean, you weren't even
in custody for a full day.

28
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,930
And I admit it was a
tad bumpy getting there,

29
00:05:14,932 --> 00:05:18,417
but the path to justice
is rarely smooth.

30
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,769
So I'm hoping that,
in the end, you know,

31
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,364
the final result speaks for itself.

32
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:29,912
You had business with my cousin, Tuco.

33
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,958
Tuco?

34
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:38,437
Ohh. Oh, sure, sure, yeah.

35
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,864
A-And I see the family resemblance.

36
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,533
Your cousin makes quite an impression.

37
00:05:43,535 --> 00:05:45,553
You know, he... he has a huge heart

38
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:49,782
and a... a serious passion for justice.

39
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:51,450
He's got a temper, huh?

40
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,376
I hadn't noticed.

41
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:54,803
Uh.

42
00:05:54,805 --> 00:05:57,398
How is your lovely Abuelita?

43
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:05,573
You know, Tuco told me about you.

44
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,158
You're the guy with the mouth.

45
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,470
Yeah.

46
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:14,582
Those guys at the house...

47
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:16,825
what'd they call her?

48
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,310
"Bizznatch".

49
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:21,589
"Bizznatch".

50
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,133
Yeah, right.

51
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,911
You know, the Tuco I know...

52
00:06:27,913 --> 00:06:29,857
he woulda skinned 'em alive

53
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,157
and let the buzzards eat their eyeballs.

54
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,509
But there you were.

55
00:06:34,511 --> 00:06:37,253
You go, "Blah, blah, blah",
and they walk out of there.

56
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:39,014
I mean, it's amazing, really!

57
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:41,400
They wheeled out, actually.

58
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,054
So, Ignacio and I,

59
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,241
we got something you can do for us.

60
00:06:50,527 --> 00:06:52,328
Really?

61
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,529
Yeah. We got a legal problem.

62
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:58,517
A le... A legal problem?

63
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,868
Alright, fantastic.

64
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,630
I'm so... Just, for a minute there,

65
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,114
I thought I was gonna be

66
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,191
swallowing condoms filled with heroin.

67
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,194
No.

68
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,954
Maybe later.

69
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,883
We have a guy sitting in MDC.

70
00:07:14,885 --> 00:07:16,243
Picked up two days ago.

71
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:17,536
Uh, picked up for what?

72
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,888
Yeah, we'll get to that.

73
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,299
We need our friend to
tell the cops some things.

74
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,893
Some important things.

75
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,970
Important things. Gotcha.

76
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:30,306
We want him to say
exactly what we tell him...

77
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:31,900
no more, no less.

78
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,553
But the cops can't know
it's coming from us.

79
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:36,905
So we send you in there,

80
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:39,558
you tell him how to do it,

81
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,560
and they can't listen.

82
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:44,320
Attorney-client confidentiality.

83
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:46,090
Yeah, that.

84
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,570
Uh. It's flattering.

85
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,921
Uh.

86
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:59,853
Can I offer this?

87
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,372
Listen, I guarantee

88
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:03,598
there are five of
these in MDC right now.

89
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,935
You know, drop phones inside
someone's prison wallet,

90
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,529
if you know what I'm talking about.

91
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,698
Anyway, you talk directly to your guy.

92
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,441
Cut out the middle man.

93
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:15,327
It works better if
you're in there with him.

94
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:19,206
You're the guy for this.

95
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:23,452
That's just... That's...

96
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:24,953
terrific.

97
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,605
That's the only word for it.

98
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,595
Um.

99
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:32,368
In good conscience,
I think I have to s...

100
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,722
warn you that my...
my rates have gone up.

101
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,433
Uh, so going this way
could be expensive.

102
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:41,453
Ex... How expensive?

103
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,731
Expensive.

104
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:46,233
It's... I mean...

105
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:49,144
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Um.

106
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:51,739
Oh, gee, well, it's
a full day of my time.

107
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,380
And prep work, transportation,

108
00:08:54,382 --> 00:08:56,113
rush fees...

109
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,969
Uh, do the math.

110
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:03,107
It's like seven thousand... eight...

111
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,162
nine hundred... and twenty five dollars.

112
00:09:07,164 --> 00:09:08,647
Yeah.

113
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,984
Uh-huh. Yeah.

114
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:17,097
$7,925?

115
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,185
Uh, it's... it's the going rate, so...

116
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:25,714
Sure.

117
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,206
For your trouble, let's make it $8,000.

118
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:50,214
Well. Okay, then.

119
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:00,957
Another.

120
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,207
I don't know, Mike.

121
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,151
How 'bout you call it a night?

122
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,212
And I'll get you a cab.

123
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:25,390
Put 'em in the register
and pour me another.

124
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:57,531
- Hey.
- Yeah.

125
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,517
You see that?

126
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,763
You want to do something for me?

127
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,042
Take it down.

128
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,435
What?

129
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,438
Right there.

130
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,292
The... The third from the bottom.

131
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,286
I dunno, Mike.

132
00:11:19,288 --> 00:11:20,888
Customers send these in.

133
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,538
It's a tradition.

134
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,224
Take it down.

135
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,636
Sorry, Mike.

136
00:11:27,638 --> 00:11:30,639
Take it down.

137
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,900
I think you've had enough.

138
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:35,127
Take it. Down. Now.

139
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:43,652
Please.

140
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,088
Oh, my God.

141
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,499
You know that's my sister, y'all.

142
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:15,943
Let's...

143
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,186
Hey, she is spicy, yo.

144
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,504
That's what I'm saying.

145
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,189
Yeah. I'm trying to holla at her.

146
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:22,598
- Oh.
- Mm.

147
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,951
Check this one out.

148
00:12:26,196 --> 00:12:30,440
Alright, y'all. Let's play.

149
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,367
Hey, Gramps! Where ya going?

150
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:35,379
Yo, got 20 bucks you could lend me?

151
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,115
Ah. Don't be scared.

152
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:41,969
I ain't gonna bite.

153
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:44,379
Oh.

154
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:49,034
I got a lot more than 20 bucks, asshole.

155
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:50,953
- Hey, yo, Gramps can throw down. Okay.
- Yo, we got a live one, bro.

156
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,930
You gonna let ol' cue ball
there talk to you like that?!

157
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:55,874
Hold up, Gramps.

158
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:07,886
So?

159
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,830
Good.

160
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:49,611
Hey.

161
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:52,039
Hey.

162
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:04,200
You done?

163
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:05,802
Just about.

164
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,017
Thanks.

165
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,053
Everything good?

166
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah.

167
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,725
I'm sort of celebrating, actually.

168
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:31,727
Celebrating what?

169
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,488
I just realized

170
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,763
I have all pro bono
clients tomorrow, all day.

171
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,407
No Mesa Verde.

172
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,904
Well, alright.

173
00:14:41,906 --> 00:14:43,665
To justice.

174
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:46,051
Yeah.

175
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:52,657
What about you?

176
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,661
Well...

177
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,088
I met...

178
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,851
some interesting people

179
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:05,612
and had a few...

180
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,365
ups and downs.

181
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:11,623
But you know what?

182
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:13,269
Financially speaking,

183
00:15:13,271 --> 00:15:16,623
Saul Goodman just had his best day yet.

184
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,083
Ka-ching!

185
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,879
Huh.

186
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:30,846
Good for Saul.

187
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,888
I'd better prep for tomorrow.

188
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,163
Right.

189
00:15:41,165 --> 00:15:43,892
Go get 'em, tiger.

190
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,559
iGol!

191
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:10,418
Numilifor is not for everyone.

192
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,161
Call your doctor if you have
unusual aches and pains.

193
00:16:12,163 --> 00:16:15,515
- Sorry.
- Side effects, including constip...

194
00:16:18,762 --> 00:16:20,169
What are you doing?

195
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:22,731
I have to take it apart to clean it.

196
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:38,705
Hey.

197
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,191
Hey. Leave this alone.

198
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:45,545
Leave it alone.

199
00:16:47,365 --> 00:16:49,758
Check this out.

200
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,732
Did you order food?

201
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:08,643
Mnh-mnh.

202
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,392
Yeah?

203
00:17:16,394 --> 00:17:19,487
- Ignacio?
- What?

204
00:17:19,489 --> 00:17:22,640
I want to see Ignacio.

205
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,400
Who is this?

206
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:27,212
His father.

207
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,269
Um.

208
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,432
Hi.

209
00:17:56,434 --> 00:17:59,411
Amber, this is my father.

210
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:05,775
Nice to meet you.

211
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:07,443
Oh, yeah, me too.

212
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:10,839
Um. 'Scuse me.

213
00:19:20,944 --> 00:19:24,101
Mm.

214
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,825
No.

215
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,653
Papa, no. No.

216
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,675
Nice to meet you, young lady.

217
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:25,868
Kim, something's come up with Tucumcari.

218
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,795
- Not now, Stef.
- I wouldn't bother you with it, but...

219
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:29,705
- I asked you to handle it.
- We are, but there's...

220
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:31,057
Stef, this is not the time.

221
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,518
Alright?

222
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,808
Okay.

223
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,627
Okay.

224
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:46,221
Ms. Wexler, I've reviewed
your motion to dismiss

225
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:48,891
and the state's one-page response.

226
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:51,352
Your argument is well-reasoned,

227
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,154
however, I'm denying the motion.

228
00:22:53,156 --> 00:22:55,323
Your Honor, I'd like to remind you that

229
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,491
this was essentially nothing
more than a family dispute.

230
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,401
- My client was...
- Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there.

231
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:00,712
This is not your client's

232
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,647
first negative interaction
with the victim,

233
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:04,090
which shows a pattern of behavior.

234
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,241
And as such, I still
agree with the state

235
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:08,336
that this matter is
worth the court's time.

236
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:11,413
- Your Honor, my...
- Jury selection begins June 16th.

237
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:15,101
I'm sorry this didn't go our way.

238
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:17,345
Going in, we all knew
getting the case dismissed

239
00:23:17,347 --> 00:23:18,996
would be a long shot.

240
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,773
The judge seemed kinda mad.

241
00:23:20,775 --> 00:23:23,000
Yeah. She can come off that way,

242
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:24,694
but she's actually very fair.

243
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:27,355
So now the prosecution
will come back to us

244
00:23:27,357 --> 00:23:29,006
with a more realistic plea bargain,

245
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,545
but if we don't like
what they have to offer,

246
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,176
I believe we'll win at trial.

247
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,620
What does that mean?

248
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,950
We'll have a chance to
explain what really happened

249
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:37,698
in front of a jury of regular people.

250
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,775
Look, you were trying
to do a good thing,

251
00:23:39,777 --> 00:23:41,794
and I think they'll see that.

252
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,779
Just keep the faith, okay?

253
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:45,706
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll be right back.

254
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,375
It's Rich.

255
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:49,802
This is the second time he's called.

256
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,137
Hey, Rich.

257
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,713
I'm confused.

258
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:54,974
I thought you'd be on your
way to Tucumcari by now.

259
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,350
- Uh, Rich...
- I just got off with Kevin Wachtell.

260
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,637
He wants you there right now to
straighten this out, hands on.

261
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,623
Well, I'm flattered,
but my clients need me.

262
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:03,966
I have a full day of appearances here.

263
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,151
Well, all I can tell you...

264
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,136
he's called twice in 40 minutes.

265
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:10,047
I promise you,
Tucumcari's under control.

266
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,824
The associates are more than capable.

267
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:13,567
Help me understand.

268
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:15,403
It's not like you're in the
middle of a murder trial.

269
00:24:15,405 --> 00:24:18,183
Rich, this... this is
just Kevin being Kevin.

270
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,240
Now, don't get me wrong...

271
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:21,000
I respect your devotion
to your pro bono clients.

272
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,411
But Mesa Verde keeps the lights on.

273
00:24:23,413 --> 00:24:24,796
Can we agree on that?

274
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,382
Of course.

275
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,056
We've all been here.

276
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:31,216
Once in a while,

277
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:33,905
you have to give a little
to get a little, you know?

278
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:35,181
Mm-hmm.

279
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,766
Viola's already briefed Stef and Gary.

280
00:24:36,768 --> 00:24:38,184
They'll take your afternoon cases

281
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,186
and get continuances if necessary.

282
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,438
So get yourself down there, stat.

283
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:45,099
Alright.

284
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,435
I'm on my way.

285
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,343
Who the hell're you?

286
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:11,867
Shhh!

287
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:17,919
Now, thank you, Officer.

288
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:20,876
We'll let you know when we're done.

289
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:28,109
Sit.

290
00:25:29,404 --> 00:25:31,863
Who are you?

291
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,563
I'm your new lawyer.

292
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,400
- I didn't call no lawyer.
- No, you didn't.

293
00:25:45,402 --> 00:25:47,069
Lalo did.

294
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,998
I didn't say anything to no one.

295
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,593
- I kept my mouth shut.
- I know, I know.

296
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,152
Don't worry, kid.

297
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,930
I'm nothin' but good news for you.

298
00:25:57,932 --> 00:26:01,175
Alright, we have a lot to go over here.

299
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:04,228
How are you at memorization?

300
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,568
Scuse me.

301
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,753
Hey, Myrna. How's the boy?

302
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,056
He's good, Hank.

303
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,891
He's, what, uh, third base?

304
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,409
- Catcher.
- Catcher.

305
00:27:08,411 --> 00:27:10,670
Hey, Steve.

306
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:13,155
Looking good, Myrna.

307
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,992
Lemme ask you something...

308
00:27:16,994 --> 00:27:20,894
does Blanca throw stuff out
on the exact day it expires?

309
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:23,253
- Like what?
- Anything.

310
00:27:23,255 --> 00:27:26,185
Uh, milk, ketchup, soy sauce.

311
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,596
As the clock literally strikes midnight,

312
00:27:28,598 --> 00:27:30,581
Marie hands me a full Hefty bag

313
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,750
and pushes me out to the trash cans.

314
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:35,177
I mean, you know, most
of it's still good.

315
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:36,529
What the hell?

316
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,606
Food banks don't take expired food.

317
00:27:38,608 --> 00:27:40,758
Oh, thanks for that, Ann Landers.

318
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,703
Once I found an old can
of, uh, vanilla frosting.

319
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,122
I ate that. I'm still here.

320
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,599
You what?

321
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:50,951
Hey, we were talking about expired food.

322
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,603
I thought it was relevant.

323
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:57,441
Let's get this circle jerk over with.

324
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,576
Alrighty.

325
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,470
Domingo Molina.

326
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:28,989
Picked up for possession

327
00:28:28,991 --> 00:28:32,143
of half ounce of street grade gak.

328
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:33,936
That's dealing weight.

329
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:37,823
Keeps his mouth shut for the
first two nights he's in here

330
00:28:37,825 --> 00:28:42,244
and now has an epiphany
and wants to talk.

331
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:44,838
Okay.

332
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,007
Wow me.

333
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:51,229
Make my tiny eyes
grow wide with delight.

334
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,607
What if I know where

335
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:56,776
there's half a million in drug money?

336
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:59,594
What if?

337
00:28:59,596 --> 00:29:02,597
What. If?

338
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,675
If that's true,

339
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,619
things could go well for you.

340
00:29:06,621 --> 00:29:07,774
My partner's right.

341
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:11,261
That kind of information
can lead to good things.

342
00:29:13,277 --> 00:29:14,794
Gimme the deets.

343
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:18,631
Where the drugs come from,
who the money goes to,

344
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:23,285
the name of your boss
and who you report to.

345
00:29:23,287 --> 00:29:24,953
For starters.

346
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:30,059
Okay.

347
00:29:33,055 --> 00:29:35,389
The dealers kick up the cash, right?

348
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,300
But they don't go face
to face with the big guys.

349
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:41,303
So... they leave it in different spots.

350
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:43,698
- Dead drops.
- Yeah.

351
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,241
Sounds like a big operation.

352
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,494
Hello! Hey!

353
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,329
Oho! Silence!

354
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,164
Were you talking to them?

355
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,166
Were you talking to my client

356
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,076
without his lawyer present?

357
00:29:56,078 --> 00:29:58,912
And you are... ?

358
00:29:58,914 --> 00:30:00,231
Saul Goodman.

359
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,749
I'm Mr. Molina's attorney.

360
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:04,844
And you're in violation of
his constitutional rights.

361
00:30:04,846 --> 00:30:06,253
Saul.

362
00:30:06,255 --> 00:30:08,422
Saul. Good. Man.

363
00:30:08,424 --> 00:30:10,665
Really? Come on. That's your name?

364
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,501
- Listen, Officer...
- Uh, uh.

365
00:30:12,503 --> 00:30:14,095
Special agent.

366
00:30:14,097 --> 00:30:16,445
Oh, the DEA? Oh, I see.

367
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,745
Okay. The Feds.

368
00:30:17,747 --> 00:30:19,692
Well, what, they don't
teach the Constitution

369
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,185
at Quantico these days?

370
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,695
Yeah. Quantico is FBI.

371
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:24,255
I don't care.

372
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:26,377
The DEA, FBI, Department of Sanitation.

373
00:30:26,379 --> 00:30:28,863
It's time for you two gentlemen
to vacate the premises.

374
00:30:28,865 --> 00:30:29,869
There's the door.

375
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,370
Shoo, shoo. Go away.

376
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,706
Uh, your client waived
his right to an attorney.

377
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,616
Whoa, he most certainly did not.

378
00:30:35,618 --> 00:30:36,784
Yeah, I did.

379
00:30:36,786 --> 00:30:38,878
Zip it. Okay? Nobody's talking to you.

380
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
Uh, well, he wants to talk to us.

381
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,262
He... He's confused.

382
00:30:42,264 --> 00:30:44,275
Okay? He was dropped
on his head as a child.

383
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:46,231
- I wanna talk.
- No, you don't!

384
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:48,946
- Yeah. I do.
- Sounds like he does.

385
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,556
You just, uh, one... one moment.

386
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,374
Come... Come here.

387
00:30:52,376 --> 00:30:54,727
Just come here.

388
00:30:56,806 --> 00:30:58,289
Do you know...

389
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,957
and we just discussed this, okay?

390
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,068
You don't talk to...

391
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,070
I'm doing my job!

392
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:06,146
Which is protecting you from you!

393
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:08,007
I'm talkin' whether you like it or not!

394
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,910
You're killing me here, man!

395
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:15,639
Okay. Look.

396
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,157
My client is making

397
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:20,327
what I believe to be a grave error.

398
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:24,331
Also showing a heartbreaking
lack of faith in his attorney.

399
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:27,651
And I'm not gonna lie, it hurts.

400
00:31:29,931 --> 00:31:34,391
He insists on dealing,
so let's talk turkey.

401
00:31:37,146 --> 00:31:38,846
You know what?

402
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:41,107
We're not interested.

403
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,442
I feel like my chain is being jerked.

404
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,945
And not in a good way, if
you know what I'm saying.

405
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,947
There's no half mil. Never was.

406
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:51,283
- Yep. Bullshit. I called it, Gomey. Remember?
- You did.

407
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:53,119
- Hold on, guys. Hold on.
- Think I'm gonna blow this Popsicle stand.

408
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,936
- Wait a second.
- You gentlemen have a great afternoon.

409
00:31:54,938 --> 00:31:56,438
- Hold up, guys, one second.
- Hey, hey, have a good day.

410
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,898
We're done in here!

411
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,875
Guys, um, uh.

412
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:02,837
Uh, what if we say it's contingent?

413
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:08,116
Contingent?

414
00:32:08,118 --> 00:32:09,693
On what?

415
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,637
Results.

416
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,213
Mr. Molina will stay in custody

417
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:15,808
while you verify his very specific,

418
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:17,626
limited information.

419
00:32:17,628 --> 00:32:20,917
And what if what he
tells us doesn't pan out?

420
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,706
Oh, well, then he just stays here.

421
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,817
I mean, we're back where we started.

422
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,469
But if his information
leads to something...

423
00:32:27,471 --> 00:32:28,729
Arrests.

424
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:30,105
Uh... What?

425
00:32:30,107 --> 00:32:34,994
If his information leads to arrests...

426
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,483
Well, yeah.

427
00:32:41,485 --> 00:32:45,004
Well, if his information
leads to arrests, then...

428
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,747
the charges go away.

429
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:48,841
Okay? Now, how can you say no to that?

430
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:51,251
That is a win-win for you guys.

431
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:01,503
Give us another minute.

432
00:33:01,505 --> 00:33:03,022
Okay.

433
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:07,418
Okay, Domingo.

434
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,678
Start talking.

435
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,198
Go head.

436
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,076
Like I said, the dealers
kick up the cash.

437
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:19,763
I don't know who picks it up.

438
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,874
All I know is that there
are these three dead drops

439
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,450
- they run on Thursday nights and...
- Hold on.

440
00:33:23,452 --> 00:33:24,558
What? What?!

441
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,499
Look, I know how this goes, alright?

442
00:33:26,501 --> 00:33:27,849
My guy talks to you,

443
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:29,531
you squeeze him out like a sponge,

444
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,866
then you dump him back on the street.

445
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:33,385
Word gets out that he's a fink,

446
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,295
he ends up bleeding out in
front of his mother's house.

447
00:33:35,297 --> 00:33:37,899
- What? No.
- It's not gonna happen, okay?

448
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,116
Do you hear what I'm saying?

449
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:42,937
My client is not leaving here
with a target on his back.

450
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,983
Fine. We'll take care of him.

451
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,412
Assuming this isn't one big jag off.

452
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:05,251
It'll look like he got out
because his lawyer's a genius.

453
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:09,834
Okay. And he's... he's not just
anyone's C.I., either. Alright?

454
00:34:09,836 --> 00:34:12,359
You don't pass him around
like a venereal disease.

455
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,743
He's your personal C.I.

456
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:17,170
So, he gets picked up,
he calls me, I call you.

457
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:20,891
It gets taken care of.
No questions asked.

458
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:25,286
Okay, but it's contingent.

459
00:34:25,288 --> 00:34:26,626
Sure.

460
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:28,812
And this better be worth it.

461
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:32,019
Yeah.

462
00:34:32,021 --> 00:34:33,946
Okay.

463
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:37,007
So, like I said,

464
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,690
there are these three dead drops.

465
00:34:38,692 --> 00:34:41,032
The first one's under a
bridge up by Chavez Road,

466
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,604
over Hillsdale Street.

467
00:34:42,606 --> 00:34:44,957
The second one's in an empty rail yard

468
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,412
off Waldren in a train shed.

469
00:34:47,414 --> 00:34:48,647
There's a...

470
00:34:59,746 --> 00:35:02,123
Oh, thank God.

471
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:07,721
- Is he home?
- Yeah, he never seems to leave.

472
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:09,648
A word of warning.

473
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,966
He's very unpleasant.

474
00:35:11,968 --> 00:35:15,154
Got it.

475
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:28,584
Mr. Acker, I think you're home!

476
00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:31,628
My name is Kim Wexler,

477
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,064
and I'd really like to talk to you!

478
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:48,002
Mr. Acker. Hello.

479
00:35:48,004 --> 00:35:49,706
Thanks for speaking with me.

480
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:51,656
I think there's been a misunderstanding,

481
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,266
and it's in everyone's best interests

482
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,601
if we straighten it out.

483
00:35:54,603 --> 00:35:56,103
May I come in?

484
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:58,989
Stay right where you're at.

485
00:36:15,198 --> 00:36:18,425
Okay.

486
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,724
As I understand it,

487
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,060
you and your family have
been here since 1974.

488
00:36:29,212 --> 00:36:31,397
You built this lovely house,

489
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,807
but you never actually
owned the land it was on.

490
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:35,800
It was leased to you by a local company,

491
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,403
Deerview Investment Properties.

492
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,887
For a hundred years.

493
00:36:38,889 --> 00:36:40,572
I got 70 left.

494
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:42,482
That's correct.

495
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:44,100
However, and I know

496
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,803
this may be difficult
to wrap your head around,

497
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,415
your lease stipulates
that the property owner

498
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,583
can buy you out at any time

499
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:54,402
for fair market value plus $5,000.

500
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:57,047
I know $5,000 isn't nearly as much

501
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,907
as it used to be back in 1974,

502
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:01,427
and... and we do understand how...

503
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,654
inconvenient this must be,

504
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,914
so, as a gesture of goodwill,

505
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:10,217
Mesa Verde has just increased
your buy-out to $18,000.

506
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,255
$18,000?

507
00:37:12,257 --> 00:37:13,680
That's right.

508
00:37:13,682 --> 00:37:18,685
Well, nobody's ever explained
it to me like that before.

509
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:21,095
$18,000.

510
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:23,690
That's a lot of money.

511
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:25,037
I bet you, with that,

512
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:28,287
I could buy a big old mansion
and a swimming pool.

513
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,271
Mr. Acker, we know it's not enough to...

514
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,434
Hey, do me a favor, will ya?

515
00:37:31,436 --> 00:37:34,108
I'm gonna spread my legs out like this,

516
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:36,703
and, uh, just to finish it off,

517
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:39,798
why don't you give me a
swift kick in the balls?

518
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,282
That's not necessary.

519
00:37:41,284 --> 00:37:43,877
You people are all the same.

520
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:45,905
You're soulless money grubbers.

521
00:37:45,907 --> 00:37:47,412
Please, Mr. Acker,

522
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:49,308
how about we just discuss this... civil?

523
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:52,126
Adverse possession
means this is my land.

524
00:37:52,128 --> 00:37:54,104
You made that argument in court,

525
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,626
and the judge ruled against you.

526
00:37:55,628 --> 00:37:58,132
Yeah, and nobody could change my mind,

527
00:37:58,134 --> 00:37:59,801
so they sent you out.

528
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:02,015
You're the big guns?

529
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:04,369
With a ponytail?

530
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,994
Oh, you're just like
all the rest of 'em,

531
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:11,905
coming out here in your fancy suit,

532
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:14,148
bring your minions with you,

533
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:19,153
driving them black, shiny German cars.

534
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:22,869
And you think you can talk to me

535
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:25,320
like I'm brain damaged?

536
00:38:25,322 --> 00:38:29,163
N. O! No!

537
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:36,522
That big bank thinks it's
gonna build a call center, so...

538
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:41,860
you go around throwing
people out of their homes.

539
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:45,781
Well, not this house, sweetheart!

540
00:38:49,185 --> 00:38:50,518
Alright.

541
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,946
I can see you've made up your mind.

542
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:54,431
Have a good day.

543
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,583
And I can see you.

544
00:38:58,028 --> 00:39:00,437
You're one of those people that, uh,

545
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:03,607
give a little money
to charity every month

546
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,294
so you can make up for all
the bad that you've done.

547
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:11,205
You go to a soup kitchen
once a year on Thanksgiving.

548
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:14,968
That makes you feel a whole
lot better about yourself.

549
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,805
Makes you feel like one
of the best rich people.

550
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,136
Oh, I don't know how in the
world you sleep at night.

551
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:38,399
Listen to me.

552
00:39:38,401 --> 00:39:41,828
You do not get to
make up your own rules.

553
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,831
Put on your big boy
pants and face reality...

554
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,593
no one is mistreating you here.

555
00:39:47,595 --> 00:39:50,411
We were trying to meet you halfway...

556
00:39:50,413 --> 00:39:52,413
well, that's over.

557
00:39:52,415 --> 00:39:54,766
The $18,000? Guess what?

558
00:39:54,768 --> 00:39:56,584
It's off the table.

559
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,604
Tomorrow you come to your senses?

560
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:00,013
You'll get $10,000.

561
00:40:00,015 --> 00:40:02,256
And you know what happens after that?

562
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:04,926
The sheriff comes out
and kicks you outta here

563
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,761
and you get nothing.

564
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:10,098
Why should you get to drag
this out for seven months

565
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,267
while all of your neighbors,
every single one of them,

566
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:14,786
played by the rules?!

567
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:18,290
And do you... do you... do
you think you're special?

568
00:40:18,292 --> 00:40:21,868
A contract means something.

569
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,279
It's the law, and it's enforceable!

570
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:27,874
Deal with it!

571
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:34,640
That was amazing. Great job.

572
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,624
I didn't solve anything.

573
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,542
Mm. You ended it.

574
00:40:38,544 --> 00:40:40,277
That's what we needed.

575
00:41:20,929 --> 00:41:23,503
Whoo-hoo! You hear that?

576
00:41:23,505 --> 00:41:25,771
I replaced the carburetor.

577
00:41:25,773 --> 00:41:27,734
She's running like a racehorse, man.

578
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,085
It's a fine vehicle.

579
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:30,587
That's a thing of beauty.

580
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,939
Yeah? What do you drive?

581
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:34,682
An Esteem.

582
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:36,017
A what?

583
00:41:36,019 --> 00:41:38,445
A Suzuki Esteem.

584
00:41:38,447 --> 00:41:40,855
It's an import.

585
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:42,736
Huh. So... ?

586
00:41:42,738 --> 00:41:44,784
Yeah, so, it went just like you wanted.

587
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:46,953
Assuming the dead
drops are a real thing,

588
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,271
the feds are going to be on them.

589
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,646
- Feds?
- Yeah. DEA.

590
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:52,242
There's a matched pair of 'em,

591
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,110
and they're into this with a vengeance.

592
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,722
I mean, think feeding
time in the lion cage.

593
00:41:56,724 --> 00:42:00,892
And, um they're gunning for arrests.

594
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:03,636
Okay.

595
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:05,731
Oh, and...

596
00:42:05,733 --> 00:42:08,203
your guy is now a
confidential informant.

597
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,560
What do you mean... like a rat?

598
00:42:09,562 --> 00:42:11,144
No, he's not a rat. No.

599
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:13,888
I mean, well, if he's a
rat, he's your rat, so...

600
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,632
Uh, put it this way...

601
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,909
you now have a hotline to the DEA.

602
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,986
And not just now... anytime.

603
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:22,155
So that's a good thing, right?

604
00:42:22,157 --> 00:42:24,398
But the deal is, at some point,

605
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,401
you might hear that Domingo is a snitch.

606
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:30,922
Y-You gotta know he's not.

607
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:34,151
And what do you care?

608
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:36,244
Well, all due respect,

609
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:38,004
you're paying me, but he's my client.

610
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:40,156
I'd like to keep him alive.

611
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:48,456
And, uh, one more thing.

612
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:50,590
Um, you're gonna have to find

613
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:52,260
a different attorney
for future endeavors,

614
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:55,781
'cause my schedule is
just very, very tight.

615
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:00,434
You'll make time.

616
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:02,621
Ah.

617
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:18,290
Who exactly did I just set up?

618
00:43:19,622 --> 00:43:20,880
You don't want to know.

619
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,974
I mean, if there's gonna be blowback,

620
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,956
I don't want to be in the middle of it.

621
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,461
It's not about what you want.

622
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:31,650
When you're in, you're in.

623
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:10,597
And Martinez?

624
00:44:10,599 --> 00:44:12,506
We got a continuance.

625
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:13,952
Good. Davenport?

626
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:16,252
The judge read your
motion and dismissed.

627
00:44:16,254 --> 00:44:17,511
Yes.

628
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,383
Oh, and I got a continuance on Russo.

629
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:21,199
His hearing's scheduled
for Thursday morning, right?

630
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,351
Yep. Viola put it in your calendar.

631
00:44:23,353 --> 00:44:24,928
Good, What about Ingram?

632
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:26,204
He didn't show.

633
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,189
Did you call all three numbers?

634
00:44:28,191 --> 00:44:29,710
I called the first one.

635
00:44:29,712 --> 00:44:31,419
You have to call all three.

636
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:32,860
The bottom number is his aunt.

637
00:44:32,862 --> 00:44:34,787
- She usually knows where he is.
- I'm sorry.

638
00:44:34,789 --> 00:44:36,147
I got a continuance.

639
00:44:36,149 --> 00:44:37,382
That's okay.

640
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,050
Call his aunt and make sure he's alright

641
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,701
and ask how I can get in touch with him

642
00:44:40,703 --> 00:44:42,721
before his next hearing.

643
00:44:42,723 --> 00:44:44,205
And if she doesn't know,

644
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:45,706
call the Rescue Mission Shelter on 2nd.

645
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,225
That's his backup.

646
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,894
Will do.

647
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,230
Alright. Uh. Good job, Stef.

648
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,065
Thanks, Kim. Get home safe.

649
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:55,716
Yep. Have a good evening.

650
00:45:46,842 --> 00:45:48,323
Mr. Acker?

651
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,015
It's Kim Wexler again.

652
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:55,535
I'd really like another word with you.

653
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:20,318
Mr. Acker?

654
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:46,419
Mr. Acker?

655
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:51,016
I'm sorry I-I, uh,
entered your property.

656
00:46:52,835 --> 00:46:55,186
I'd really like to talk to you.

657
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,370
Hi.

658
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,373
Can we start over?

659
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,268
Say what you came to say.

660
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,861
I went to a real estate office.

661
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:23,882
I found some houses I
think you might like.

662
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:28,636
There are some really nice
options in your price range.

663
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:36,019
This one's on half an acre.

664
00:47:37,064 --> 00:47:40,123
And, uh, this one...

665
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:44,235
is older, but it has a really good view.

666
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,113
And the neighborhood's pretty.

667
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:51,651
I know moving's a big deal.

668
00:47:51,653 --> 00:47:53,894
I'd like to help you
out with that myself,

669
00:47:53,896 --> 00:47:55,580
if that's alright with you.

670
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,657
I can take off any day this week.

671
00:47:57,659 --> 00:48:00,877
And I'll pay for it
out of my own pocket.

672
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:03,903
Uh. Oh.

673
00:48:03,905 --> 00:48:07,758
This one has three bedrooms.

674
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:11,912
I know you don't want to move,

675
00:48:11,914 --> 00:48:14,915
but w-whatever house
you choose will be yours.

676
00:48:14,917 --> 00:48:18,103
You'll own it, and the land, forever.

677
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:30,012
You're right.

678
00:48:30,014 --> 00:48:33,451
I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through.

679
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:35,695
I've never owned a house.

680
00:48:35,697 --> 00:48:38,181
My family never owned one, either.

681
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:41,534
We never owned... anything.

682
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:42,876
When I was little,

683
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,188
my mother used to shake me
awake in the middle of the night,

684
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:48,299
yelling it was time to go.

685
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:52,195
She was always one step
ahead of the landlord.

686
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:54,714
I'd throw my things in a cardboard box

687
00:48:54,716 --> 00:48:56,807
and run outside

688
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,311
in my pajamas and bare feet.

689
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:06,726
Sometimes, it was so cold,

690
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:09,362
my t... my toes turned blue.

691
00:49:17,572 --> 00:49:19,980
If we'd have had a house,

692
00:49:19,982 --> 00:49:22,750
I never would've wanted to leave.

693
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:31,992
You'll say anything

694
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:35,722
to get what you want, won't you?

695
00:50:23,713 --> 00:50:25,230
When was this?

696
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:26,806
Today.

697
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:29,959
Do you have the agents' names?

698
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,978
The lawyer's got 'em.

699
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:39,318
What are you doing?

700
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,412
Shutting it down.

701
00:50:41,414 --> 00:50:43,581
Put it away.

702
00:50:46,311 --> 00:50:49,979
You want to leave the
money for the feds?

703
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:56,594
Um. If there's no money
in those dead drops,

704
00:50:56,596 --> 00:51:00,598
Lalo will know someone talked.

705
00:51:10,643 --> 00:51:13,611
The dead drops remain.

706
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:54,209
