1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,679
So, if we're ready
for signature...?

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,558
You can absolutely guarantee
it'll be the final leg?

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:14,659
No question.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,119
Anything else would be
in breach of contract.

5
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,319
Who's giving it to me?

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,359
- Excellent question, Phoebe!
- Who's giving it to her?

7
00:00:21,459 --> 00:00:22,459
Er... Anthony?

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,920
Erm...

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,759
Dame Kelly Holmes.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,839
Ooh...

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,599
I don't know who she is.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,999
- She's an olympic athlete.
- I don't care.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,718
I can have who I want, can't I,
mummy? Daddy said!

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,719
Well, darling...

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,379
Why can't I ever have
anything I want?

16
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:42,279
Well, it's...

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,879
Do we have any other choices?

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,639
Erm... Lord Coe.

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,880
- No.
- Sir Ian Botham? - No.

20
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,859
- Sir Ian Mckellen?
- No.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
- Justin Bieber.
- Yes?

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,160
He'll be fine.
Marvellous.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,140
We've brought
along a replica so that

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,359
Phoebe has plenty
of time to prepare.

25
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,759
So, you pick up from Justin,
then it's up the steps

26
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,519
and Bob's your Uncle.
You're a very lucky girl.

27
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,460
Actually, it has nothing
to do with luck.

28
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:29,179
My daddy is very,
very, very rich.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,399
She's v proud of her father.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,000
And he says I can have whatever
I want, because I'm his princess.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,480
Yes, you are.

32
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,779
So, all we need now is
your sponsorship cheque.

33
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:44,879
Of course.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,319
Good. Well, it's been an
absolute pleasure.

35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,519
How exciting!

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,239
Lucinda will be completely sick.
All she's doing is a stupid dance.

37
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,519
She'll be one of hundreds,
but I'll be special.

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,239
Yes, you will, poppet.

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,159
So what happens now?

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,959
All the paperwork will come
through in about a week

41
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,359
or so - rehearsal dates,
vip passes, details, etc.

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,519
Just make sure you've marked
July 27th on your calendar.

43
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,400
Abso-bloody-lutely!

44
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,400
Say thank you, Phoebe.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,159
She's highly strung.
V creative.

46
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, bless her.

47
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,539
How'd it go?

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,739
- Like taking candy from a baby.
- Ah-ha.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,759
It's funny how you enjoy
some jobs more than others.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,519
Because some people are
more deserving than others.

51
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,359
- Makes it all the sweeter.
- Yes, it does. Mind you...

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,698
A hundred grand
ain't to be sniffed at.

53
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:01,199
No. It's a lot of clothes.

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,359
To tell you the truth, they had
way too much money anyway.

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,119
I mean, when you think about it,
we're a bit like Robin Hood.

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Yeah, well,
we do take from the rich...

57
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:11,839
Only instead of giving it
to the poor... we buy clothes.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Which isn't quite as catchy.
No - but we look great.

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,959
You've gotta love the Olympics.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,079
Apart from the fact they're turning

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,079
the east end into a chinless
wonder's paradise.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,639
So far, we've sold 12
non-existent executive boxes

64
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,919
and three olympic torch runs.

65
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,559
She was such a brat.

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,559
Yeah, no wonder the country
is in the state it's in.

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,519
The way some people
bring up their children.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,199
All I had at her age was a
sherbet dib dab and a hula hoop.

69
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,039
I used to beat you hands down
every time. You bragging?

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,079
Snake hips Kennedy,
they used to call me.

71
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,579
Actually, he called himself that.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,999
Only cos I used to beat you.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,679
Yes, because I couldn't
get it off you, that's why.

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,279
All right, children - we've made
100 grand, you can all have hoops.

75
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,999
Sure that's wise at Albert's age?
He might do himself a mischief. Oh?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,559
Well, I could teach you
youngsters a thing or two.

77
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,099
Yes, you could, Albert.

78
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,859
I've worked something out about
you lot. You're like big kids. Yeah?

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,739
I realised when you
said you had a 100

80
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,439
grand so everyone
could have hoops.

81
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,519
Who in their right mind,
if they had a £100,000,

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,559
would even think about
spending it on hoops?

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,419
What have you got
against hoops, Eddie?

84
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,518
He's hoopist.

85
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,019
Could've had a bad
experience as a child.

86
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,159
- Yeah, he got all tangled up...
- Couldn't quite get the rhythm...

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,599
See? You're like big kids,
messing about...

88
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,479
Are you making a point here, Ed,
or just having a northern rant?

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,280
There is a point, actually.

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,400
One of you did this to Rushie!

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Hang on. How do you
know it was one of us?

92
00:05:22,761 --> 00:05:25,959
Cos it happened last night, and
you were the only ones in here.

93
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,799
Right. Right?
So? Who was it?

94
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,759
Well, whoever it was can't draw,
cos his moustache is rubbish.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,639
That's his real one.

96
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,599
You've defiled him! Look at him!

97
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,440
It's not right, this!
This man was poetry in shorts.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,760
Summat funny, Michael?

99
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,679
No.
Sorry.

100
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,959
Right, well - until one of you owns
up, you're barred. Eh? Barred?

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,759
That's a bit strong, innit Ed?

102
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,639
Especially as we're your partners.

103
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,759
I don't mind all the banter
and the general abuse,

104
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,359
but this is going too far!

105
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,240
All right, I think someone
better own up.

106
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,839
- What you looking at me for?
- Well, you're the football nut.

107
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,039
- Oi, oi, we're not all hooligans.
- Well, it wasn't me.

108
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,400
Right, well - you're barred, all
of you, till I find out who done it.

109
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,240
I mean it!

110
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,520
Let's go. Well, go on.
Come on.

111
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,600
- Barred?
- Barred!

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,799
I'm serious, guys.
It's taken me years

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,999
to teach Eddie how to
make a proper breakfast.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,960
Yes - not to mention
losing our office.

115
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:48,719
Yeah, well, he's got
that scouse resolve.

116
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,960
He won't give up till
one of us admits it.

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,960
So go on.
Who was it?

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,799
(Albert coughs uneasily)

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,919
- I'm Spartacus.
- You?!

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,759
- I did the ears.
- I er...I did the glasses.

121
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,760
And the beard?

122
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,319
Ready for this?
Watch.

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
(They all giggle and mutter)

124
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,159
(Hide the pen.)

125
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,200
See...?

126
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,359
Well, that wasn't very
grown-up, was it?

127
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,459
Albert started it.

128
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,359
- Hey, come on you snitch.
- Oh, come on, don't even start.

129
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,499
All right, that's enough,
that's enough.

130
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,319
- We can worry about Eddie later.
Albert's got a new mark. - Oh, who?

131
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,360
It's er..
Kind of personal.

132
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,840
Ash, would you...
Help me out?

133
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,898
This is Dexter Gold.
That's not his real name,

134
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:22,999
he changed it by deed
poll four years ago.

135
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,419
- What's his real name?
- Dexter Pratt.

136
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,318
Started up a "gold
hard cash" website

137
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,319
when the economy
went into turmoil

138
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,439
and he made a small fortune.

139
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,199
Classy guy.

140
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,619
Basically people who needed a few
extra pounds

141
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,719
saw his ads in the newspapers,
sent their jewellery in,

142
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,479
and he conned them by paying out
a fraction of what it was worth.

143
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,119
That is how I found him.

144
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,200
(Indistinct chatter)

145
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,640
Excuse me for just for just
a moment. Sorry.

146
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,599
Madam?

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,199
'Vivienne marchant
hit hard times

148
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,239
'when her husband died
three years ago.'

149
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,279
the worst thing is,
I feel so stupid.

150
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,159
Oh, no, no.

151
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,878
There was a time, when
if it was in a newspaper

152
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:12,179
written in black and white,
it was true!

153
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,599
- Better days.
- My George would be furious.

154
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,599
He'd have gone round there,
given him what for.

155
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,639
I'm sure he would.

156
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,299
Well, I tried!
He just laughed at me.

157
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,459
Said the conditions were
written down.

158
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,159
In small print, no doubt.

159
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,079
It's really good of you
to help me, Albert.

160
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,999
You can't be too careful who you
trust these days, my dear.

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,019
The world isn't what it was.
After all, you only met me, what,

162
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,619
three days ago?
I could be a con-man too.

163
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,040
Oh, don't be so daft!

164
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,240
(Dog growls quietly)

165
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,359
She sent this piece of filth -
listen to this -

166
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,919
two 24 carat gold rings,
a diamond brooch.

167
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,519
60 years of memories.

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,520
He sent her back £28.50.

169
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,119
- Bastard. - If we don't take this
bloke for every penny he's got,

170
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,119
I'll smack him in the
mouth just for fun.

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,599
Don't worry, Ash, he'll
receive our full attention.

172
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,719
Ah, yes, there is
a bit of a problem.

173
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,359
Isn't there always?

174
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,080
Michael?

175
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,679
We checked him out and his gold
hard cash business, it seems,

176
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,159
is just a sideline.

177
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,359
He was connected to the gold
bullion robbery at Gatwick in 2008

178
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,039
and the Tottenham warehouse
gold heist last year.

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,439
He's a fence?

180
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,419
He's a middle man
for stolen gold bullion.

181
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,678
He uses his Gold
Hard Cash business

182
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:45,179
as a cover to melt it
down and sell it on.

183
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,680
What difference does
it make if he's a crook?

184
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,779
Well, he's not just a crook,
he's one of the chaps.

185
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,999
♪ when the pimp's in the crib

194
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,479
So, because of the circles

195
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,839
he mixes in, we don't
want him coming after us.

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,479
Or worse, telling one
of his gangster friends

197
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
he's been conned
and offering them

198
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:31,799
a better deal
if they take care of us.

199
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,120
So, if we do this, we need to
close it off when we're done.

200
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,639
- Agreed?
- Yeah. Yeah.

201
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,720
Good.
Then let's find a way in.

202
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,799
Bish bosh, job's a good 'un.

203
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,479
Write the cheque,
send it to number one,

204
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,979
Winners Street, daddy's
bringing home the bacon.

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,560
When I said this deal was 24 carat,
was I right or was I wrong? Hang on.

206
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,239
Talk on your own time.

207
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,959
You touch that bleedin' phone again
and I'll shove it up your jacksy.

208
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,519
So was I right or wrong?

209
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,119
No, don't just laugh and say "yeah,"
Peter, actually say the words...

210
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,519
Was I right or wrong?

211
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,959
Exactly, you get your deal sorted
out before you spend your money.

212
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,119
Capiche?

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,639
We're middle men,
not investors,

214
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,919
when we get the deal,
they get the deal, ok?

215
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,280
Now sod off and next time
listen to me instead of

216
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:27,599
that poxy business degree you
wasted five years of your life on.

217
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,800
Shania, get your arse over here.

218
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,599
Me mug's empty.

219
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,359
Excuse me?

220
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,000
What have I told you?
Mug of tea, the minute I get in.

221
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,359
Well, he likes his movies.

222
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,199
- Movies? - Yeah, I just hacked into
his online DVD rentals account.

223
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,839
He's got 27 films
in three weeks.

224
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,479
Porn?

225
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,499
Strangely enough, no,
they all look like war films.

226
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,699
- War? - Yeah. What does
that say about him?

227
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,259
- That he likes to watch people
being shot and blown up. - Nice.

228
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,560
If he likes war movies...
What about this?

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,019
It looks like Gadaffi was trying to
ship out some of his goodies

230
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,979
while the yanks were taking
pot shots at him and

231
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,379
a couple of truck
loads went missing.

232
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,039
One of which was thought
to be gold bullion.

233
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,619
They think it's a rogue army unit.

234
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,059
So we use this
as our back story?

235
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,239
Why not?
It fits his personality.

236
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,799
It's true, so it'll check out,

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,720
and it saves time having to set
something up from scratch.

238
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,000
Hi. How you doing?

239
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,200
- There you go.
- Thanks, bye. Cheers.

240
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,798
Honestly, he is so sexist,
apparently

241
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,599
every woman in flat
shoes is a lesbian.

242
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,520
No wonder he hasn't
got a girlfriend.

243
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,479
Thing is, Baz, splitting
up consignments

244
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,040
ain't doing us any favours, we need
someone who can take the lot.

245
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm seeing this German
geezer later on,

246
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:58,480
he says he can take
whatever we've got.

247
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,959
I ain't trying to pull a fast one,

248
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,599
but a Troy ounce of gold was 875
quid when I woke up this morning.

249
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,359
Now, unless you know
something I don't,

250
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,359
why would I get less than that?

251
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,359
We'll give you 875 for
your domestic business,

252
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,159
but we are aware that sometimes
your sources are not always...

253
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,279
Legitimate?

254
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,719
So, if you want to use us

255
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,599
but you don't want us to ask,
"where is it coming from?"

256
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,719
Then we like to pay
a little less, ja?

257
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,239
Yeah, yeah.

258
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,759
So, uh...How much can you take?

259
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,319
We have no upper limit.

260
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,199
- And payment?
- What's your preference?

261
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,719
Cash.

262
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,599
The money laundering laws
are very stringent in Germany.

263
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,959
- Bankers draft or direct transfers.
- Agreed.

264
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,479
We have a 2m euro ceiling
on direct transfers.

265
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,240
Looks like you've found
your UK supplier.

266
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,039
You see, melting down trinkets sent
in by wrinklies feeling the pinch

267
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,199
ain't going to build my new pool,
is it, Barry? Let's be honest.

268
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,799
And the dealers are squeezing
all the margins, so...

269
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,479
The krauts have agreed to
take whatever we can supply,

270
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
no upper limit.

271
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,559
So, bish bosh, open up the
till, keep the change.

272
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,840
So, when do we start, boss?

273
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:42,799
I told him I'd send him his first
shipment at the end of next week.

274
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,879
There's a couple of the
lads planning jobs.

275
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,999
A cargo terminal at Stansted
and an arab bank in Kensington.

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,119
But they're a few weeks away,
so, if there's no hooky gold about,

277
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,080
let's get a few more
press ads running.

278
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:57,759
Knitting magazines, something
to terrify the bingo squad,

279
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,239
"recession to bite deep,
fuel prices to soar.

280
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,839
"The cost of cardigans and blue
rinses to go through the roof.

281
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,359
"What use is your wedding ring
if you can't turn the heating on?"

282
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Maybe do a special offer for widows!

283
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,079
I like what you did there, Baz.

284
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,879
Yeah. And then let's start with the
housewives, make 'em feel guilty

285
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,959
about their kids not having
the latest video games

286
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,679
while they're still
dripping in gold.

287
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,479
Do some photos of kids...Crying.

288
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,199
Right, get on with it!
I'm on it, boss!

289
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,599
Big push, Baz, ok?

290
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,760
Shania?

291
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,959
Sean, what have you got?

292
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,880
Well, according to his pa,
he's single,

293
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:46,320
in between girlfriends,
which is his usual state,

294
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:49,119
he's not a member of any clubs,
only drinks champagne,

295
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,239
preferably bollinger, hates dogs,
women in flat shoes

296
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,559
and bread-and-butter pudding.
And his lucky number's five.

297
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,319
So... supports Tottenham,
never goes to live matches,

298
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,799
his favourite singers are Michael
Buble, Shirley Bassey and Madonna.

299
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,999
His favourite film
is saving private Ryan.

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,679
Plays paintball on the weekend.

301
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,079
Favourite colour's gold.
On the rare occasion

302
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,959
he does go to a fancy dress party
he goes as auric goldfinger,

303
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,079
the bloke from the bond film,
but no-one ever knows who he is.

304
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,160
Oh, and he's got a parrot
named Goldie.

305
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,259
Ok. Emma?

306
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,359
He's listed as a director
of 11 companies, all gold-related,

307
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,359
with a combined
turnover of £3m,

308
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,239
so, I think we can say
he's above the poverty line.

309
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,339
- Props?
- Everything's in place, ready to go.

310
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,619
And what about our bait?

311
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,320
Ah, our bait...

312
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,140
..Looks a little something like...

313
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,359
..This.

314
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,840
Ooh...

315
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,439
Wow.
Is that real?

316
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,279
Oh, yes.

317
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,879
32 grand's worth,
give or take.

318
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,999
It's rented, so it has to go back
in one piece when we're done.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,679
That should get his attention.

320
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,599
Oh... he's got a four o'clock
meeting out in the sticks.

321
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,159
Then let's bring him in.

322
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,999
(Music blares)

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,360
(He sings tunelessly)

324
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
(Thud of an impact)

325
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
Hngh...?!

326
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,040
- Do you want to die?
- No.

327
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:35,319
In about 15 seconds, six blokes
are going to come out of the woods.

328
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,159
They'll kill me first,
then shoot you just for fun.

329
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,679
So, get in the car and drive.

330
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,160
Now!

331
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,000
He's in.

332
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,599
They jumped me on the way back
from their so-called dealers.

333
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,319
It must have been a setup.

334
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,919
No, no, no, I flagged a ride.

335
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,399
No, he's a civilian, it's all right.

336
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,320
I'll be back in an hour,
you just sit tight.

337
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,159
Ok, look, I'm sorry
to drag you into this,

338
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,519
but I was up shit creek and you
just happened to be there.

339
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,640
You saved my life.

340
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,040
I owe you one.

341
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,359
Who was after you?

342
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
Greedy bastards, that's who.

343
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,000
But you got me out and that takes
guts. You ever been in the forces?

344
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,719
No. I thought about the ta once.

345
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,560
Oh, you should do it.
Yeah? Yeah.

346
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,480
Is that what I think it was?

347
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,239
What if it was?

348
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,160
I heard you on the phone,
about the dealer.

349
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,399
- Am I going to have trouble
with you, son? - No, no.

350
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,359
The thing is, that's what I do.

351
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,679
What?

352
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
I'm a gold dealer.

353
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,040
Yeah, yeah, course you are.

354
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:29,159
Listen, thanks for the ride,
sorry for the inconvenience.

355
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,560
No! No, look, look.
Here's my card.

356
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,680
If you got something to sell,
I can find a buyer.

357
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,219
You think it worked?

358
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,739
Well, that's the thing about greed.
It's very predictable.

359
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,819
Great.

360
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,719
Sean, can you get us into
his offices tomorrow morning?

361
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,799
Yeah, I'll call Shania,
my new best friend.

362
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,920
Look, we've got to do something
about Eddie.

363
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,179
Yeah, I said that.

364
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,060
There we go.
Enjoy.

365
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,799
- We need to do something about Eddie.
- I have an idea. Oh, yeah?

366
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,599
I'm going to call in a favour.

367
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,359
(Phone rings)

368
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,119
Hello, Eddie's bar.

369
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,159
- It's Ian rush here.
- 'What?'

370
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,159
do me a favour, that's pathetic.
You don't even sound like him.

371
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,519
Hey, listen, I don't know who
you are, but you can tell that lot

372
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,320
that I'm not as stupid as they
think I am, all right? Ya f...

373
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,800
Nice try, but he
didn't believe us.

374
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:53,599
Ok. Albert, Emma.
See if you can work on him.

375
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,359
Hey, why me? I didn't draw
ears on his football hero!

376
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,299
He's got a soft spot for you.
I'm not sleeping

377
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,799
with him just so Ash can have a fry up.

378
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,139
- That's your trouble, ems.
You're selfish. - Not funny.

379
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,359
Just tell him it was Albert.
He can apologise, end of.

380
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,719
- Oh, but why me?
- Oh, Mickey then.

381
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,719
We won't tell him it was Mickey, cos
he'll make Mickey's life a misery.

382
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,539
Albert, tell him it was Sean.
Hang on a minute!

383
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,039
Sean, you're the youngest.

384
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,759
Well, if you grass me up,
I'm taking you all down with me.

385
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,279
Aren't we forgetting something here?

386
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,279
It is Eddie we're talking about.

387
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,199
Ash is right, I'm sending
two premier league grifters

388
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,600
to deal with one barman,
it shouldn't be a contest.

389
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:29,520
He's really stubborn, though.
You'll think of something.

390
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,520
Brass may be your best bet.

391
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:39,679
It won't be cheap
but it will look the part

392
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,959
once it's melted down
and moulded into blocks.

393
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,239
Well, give us a ball park, Arnie.

394
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,000
Five grand if I get it back,
ten if I don't. Done.

395
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,080
Ok. What about this?

396
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,959
What do you need?
A different seal on it.

397
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,479
Well, I'll have to melt it down
so I can stamp it.

398
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,399
Can you do that?

399
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,760
If it's made of metal, Mickey,
I can do anything.

400
00:24:06,761 --> 00:24:08,880
(Ash sniggers)

401
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,519
Metal Mickey?

402
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,239
Never mind.

403
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,840
What seal do you need on it?

404
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,240
This one.

405
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,120
We'll see you at 8.30.

406
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,338
- I don't believe you.
- It's true.

407
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,439
You wouldn't do that, Albert,

408
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,979
- you're just protecting someone.
- Eddie!

409
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,119
Why ask one of us to apologise if,
when we do, you don't believe us?

410
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,719
- You're just taking me for a mug.
- No, we're not.

411
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,640
What about the fella
you got to phone up?

412
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:49,759
- The one pretending to be Ian rush?
- No, it actually was Ian rush.

413
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,519
You're doing it again, treating me
like an idiot.

414
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,019
Eddie, you're impossible!

415
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,359
- And you're barred.
- Would it help if I slept with you?

416
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,679
- No.
- What?!

417
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,199
Sorry, I panicked just then,
I meant to say yeah. Eddie!

418
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,559
Listen, I know he did it and
until he comes here in person,

419
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,839
apologises and says in front
of witnesses that liverpool FC

420
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,120
are better than west ham,
then you're staying barred.

421
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,319
It's not happening. I mean, the flaming
cheek of it, and I never did it.

422
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,759
He's convinced himself it was you and
there's no persuading him otherwise.

423
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,480
Come on, Ash, man up.
Take one for the team.

424
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:21,239
No.

425
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,119
It'll take you 20 seconds,
how hard can it be?

426
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,019
I ain't done it.

427
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,339
- You are as stubborn as each other.
- I didn't do anything!

428
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,699
Think of Eddie's breakfast.

429
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,199
Yeah, he's finally got
his fried bread right.

430
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,479
Crunchy crust, a bit
soggy in the middle.

431
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,780
No.

432
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
I'd rather starve.

433
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,479
Thanks.

434
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,239
His diary's full but he's
got a gap in ten minutes...

435
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,519
Right.

436
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,679
Morning.

437
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,219
We set?

438
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,960
Yeah, if you lose it, I'm
stopping it out your wages.

439
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,080
Wish me luck.

440
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,560
You gave this to a friend
of mine yesterday.

441
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,359
♪ oh, it feels so good

442
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,279
♪ to have you by my side
on a Sunday morning

443
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,919
♪ let's work together, baby, yeah. ♪

444
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,200
Shania! Get yourself
a cup of tea, love.

445
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,079
You were kind enough
to give him a lift.

446
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,199
So what's on your mind?

447
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
Oh, I think you know
why I'm here.

448
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,560
Why don't you spell it out for me?

449
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,239
We have some merchandise. We're
having trouble finding a buyer.

450
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,879
Yeah, so I heard. That doesn't mean
you won't have to pay a decent price.

451
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,080
You'll have to let the dog
see the rabbit first.

452
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,439
Libyan?
Problem?

453
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,199
Not for me.

454
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,719
So you're interested, then?

455
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,239
It's what I do.
I'm a middle man.

456
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,159
I find two parties, each wanting
something the other has,

457
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,159
and no way of coming together...

458
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,360
So, really, I'm a facilitator.

459
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,799
The bottom line is, I can find a
buyer for that with one phone call.

460
00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:00,199
- Good. - As long as you and your
boyfriend understand three things.

461
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,919
I'm assuming
he is your boyfriend?

462
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,360
Yes, he is.

463
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,480
That's what I thought.

464
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,679
- Where was I?
- Three things?

465
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,799
Yeah, right. I'm not a mug,
apart from the Libyan stamp,

466
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,560
all that drama yesterday tells me
it's obviously nicked, and, er...

467
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,879
I read the newspapers
like everybody else...

468
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,439
I know where this
has come from,

469
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,759
so the price I pay will
have to reflect that.

470
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,519
Second.

471
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,599
My commission for negotiating this
deal is 20% at your end,

472
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,439
non-negotiable.

473
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,639
And third?

474
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,159
If you so much as think
about turning me over,

475
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,600
I know people who can track
you down and hurt you

476
00:28:44,601 --> 00:28:47,399
so much you'll be begging
them to finish you off.

477
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,480
I'll pass it on.

478
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,359
Once we've agreed a price, just
let us know where they need to go.

479
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,159
You mean there's more than one?

480
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,480
Yes.

481
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,479
So... how many we
talking about exactly?

482
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,880
A hundred.

483
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,520
A hundred!
All the same as that one?

484
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,959
You mean you've got the whole lot?

485
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,959
You trying to tell me it was you...

486
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,159
If this is too big for you...

487
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:26,159
Oh, no... it might take more than
one phone call that's all...

488
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,519
Can I see them?
I don't know.

489
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,640
My contacts don't like
being pissed about.

490
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,759
If I don't see the goods,
I don't pick up the phone.

491
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,820
It's your choice.

492
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,979
The place where you
dropped our mutual friend,

493
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,140
two o'clock this afternoon.

494
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,999
Holy shit.

495
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,039
I think we have a nibble.

496
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,200
Shania!

497
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,860
Get Heinz Zimmerman
on the phone.

498
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,999
Then put the kettle on.

499
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,519
Will it stand up?

500
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,879
To what?

501
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,039
- Inspection.
- 100%. - Good.

502
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,320
As long as you don't get
within six feet.

503
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,199
This ain't chicken feed, Heinz,

504
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,839
we're talking 100 kilos of 24 carat,
this is a serious shipment.

505
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,159
When's it ready?

506
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,639
Well, we'll need to melt it down
and restamp, but I can...

507
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,879
I can do the paperwork...
The question is can you handle it?

508
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,360
You talk the talk buddy,
it's time to walk the walk.

509
00:30:39,361 --> 00:30:41,919
There's three mill's worth here,
are you in or are you out?

510
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,639
'Ok we have a deal,
I'll be there.'

511
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,840
good call, be in touch.

512
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,919
♪ yo, mic check, mic check

513
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:55,239
♪ yeah here you go
nah, here, over here

514
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,840
♪ yeah, I heard he got
that hot new thing

515
00:30:56,841 --> 00:31:00,480
♪ oh-la-la-la. Yeah oh, yeah, yeah
turn it over. ♪

516
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,559
all right, babes?

517
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,320
Don't move or I'm gonna blow
your brains out, do you hear me?

518
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,599
Eddie's isn't the only bar
in London.

519
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,719
Maybe we should just find
somewhere else?

520
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,160
No, no, we'll find a way to sort it.

521
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,080
Sorry about that, but we
can't disclose our location.

522
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,079
The British army have sent
a special ops unit to find us.

523
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,520
Oh, well, fair enough then!

524
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,280
Oh, don't mind him.
He's just not the trusting type.

525
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,520
You all right then?

526
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,879
So, you think you
can get us a deal?

527
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,599
Yes, I do.

528
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,499
But it won't be easy, as I
told your lady friend here.

529
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,139
- How much?
- Well, that's hard to say.

530
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,140
- What was I telling you?
- Relax.

531
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,279
There's 100 bars.

532
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,760
I looked it up, they're worth
about 30 grand each.

533
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:43,839
If you buy 'em from the bank
of england, yeah, maybe...

534
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,240
But you won't get anything near
that, not for a shipment like this.

535
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,719
You can't move gold on without
paperwork. You need to, er,

536
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,759
melt it down, give it a new identity,
feed it back into the system.

537
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,159
That takes time and money.

538
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,039
You talking to us
about it not being easy?

539
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,039
Three months ago, we'd just done
a black ops stint in Libya,

540
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,199
dodging yank cruise missiles
and apache gun ships,

541
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,439
smuggling rebel supporters out of
tripoli before gaddafi got to them.

542
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,559
Gaddafi got his secret police
to move his stash of goodies

543
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,079
before the rebels arrived.

544
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,239
Artwork, cash... gold.

545
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,559
He died, we caught the gold truck
on the road out of tripoli.

546
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,799
And we...Relieved them of it.

547
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,959
Now we have not fought our
way across half of Africa,

548
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,439
carrying 100 kilos in gold bars and
then smuggled them into the uk,

549
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,559
just so some smarmy scumbag
civilian can try to rip us off.

550
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,519
Do you get me?

551
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,720
Back off, corporal.

552
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,239
(He laughs)

553
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,279
Yes, sir.

554
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,040
(He continues laughing)

555
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,879
How much?

556
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,398
I can get you half a million,
transferred into any account,

557
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:59,699
you like, anywhere in
the world in 20 seconds.

558
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,199
I'd rather shoot him
where he stands.

559
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,399
You want to spend another
two weeks in here!?

560
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,479
We've been screwed
over twice now.

561
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,639
You won't get a better price,
I guarantee it. He's playing us.

562
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:13,999
Half a million pounds
is a lot of money.

563
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,759
What about half a million,
but no commission?

564
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,098
You make what you
can when you move it on.

565
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:24,099
- Commission is non-negotiable.
- Yeah? I say we negotiate.

566
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,879
All right! Ok!

567
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,400
- Forget the commission. Heart of
gold, that's my trouble. - When?

568
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,880
I need to verify the shipment first.

569
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,120
I mean a sample,
check the purity.

570
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,999
What else?

571
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,320
Well, if it all checks out, I can get
this done in 24 hours. Bish bosh!

572
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,840
24 hours.

573
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,959
Well?

574
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,240
Bloody hell, boss.

575
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:54,059
- It's top end, 24 carat.
- And?

576
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,719
Well, it's Libyan government seal,
it's about as kosher as it gets.

577
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,059
What's it worth?

578
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,739
Gold price this morning was up a
bit, so... just about £33,500?

579
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,440
So 100 bars...?

580
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,800
Three million, three hundred
thousand, and change.

581
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
Hmm.

582
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,840
- Grub's up.
- Great!

583
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,279
The mark just called,
everything's set up for tomorrow.

584
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,579
We're just running
through a few things.

585
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:38,559
- Oh, right. Er, two COD, Albert.
- Thank you. - And one for Mickey.

586
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,840
Pie for me, haddock for ems...

587
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,319
- ..And a saveloy for Sean.
- Saveloy!

588
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,279
So, when did he phone?

589
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,959
About 20 minutes ago.

590
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,319
It'll be a pleasure to
take his money.

591
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,759
If this works, Albert was thinking
of giving some money to Vivienne,

592
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,039
you know, maybe send her on
a cruise or something. Great idea.

593
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,799
Don't forget, we've still got to
sort Eddie out as well. Yes, we do.

594
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,319
I'm not apologising for
something I didn't do.

595
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:09,079
- No, of course not, no-one would
expect you to. - Sean had an idea.

596
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,279
Mm, I mean, he wouldn't believe me
that it was Albert,

597
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,519
but I reckon, if I try hard enough,
I can convince him it was me.

598
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,119
What, you'd hold your hand up?

599
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,119
Yeah, if that's what it takes to fix
it then that's what I have to do.

600
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,639
Well, I think that's brilliant,
Sean.

601
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,879
Yeah. Yeah, it is. Only thing is,
I'm not sure what to say to him.

602
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,879
- Just say sorry for scribbling
on his photo. - Yeah, that's fine.

603
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,679
No, no, no, no, it was more
than that, it was Ian rush.

604
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,659
He's football royalty
for scousers.

605
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,259
No, you've got to say
something like, erm...

606
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,639
I'm sorry for defacing the photograph

607
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,639
of the greatest footballer
who ever lived.

608
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,359
Sounds a bit over the top.

609
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,999
Yeah, well he's obsessed,
I'm telling you.

610
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,799
What about the other thing, though?

611
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:51,299
That he wants us to say that
liverpool is better than west ham?

612
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,719
No, no, that was just for Ash.

613
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,879
I don't even support west ham.

614
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,679
- They were relegated! - Oi, they
weren't relegated in that way.

615
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,119
So how many ways are there?

616
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,719
That's what a lot of people think,
you see, that west ham went down

617
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,639
because they weren't any good,
but that's not true.

618
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,739
No, no, we just went in the
championship for a rest, right?

619
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,139
To take a break before we launched
our next assault on the premiership.

620
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,639
- So should I say it or not?
- Well, Eddie is stubborn remember.

621
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,458
Just tell him that liverpool are
the greatest team on the planet.

622
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:24,359
Yes, he would
definitely go for that.

623
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,179
And when he's gone for
that and shaken hands,

624
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,379
- give him a message from Ash.
- Yeah? What's that?

625
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,419
That liverpool play like bunch
of girls and west ham

626
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,818
are the only proper
team in Europe.

627
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,019
That's not going to help.

628
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,459
It is true, honestly.

629
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,679
All right... Sean, it is
very kind of you to do this,

630
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,839
but let's move on.

631
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,898
Tomorrow, at nine,
Emma sets up the mark.

632
00:38:44,899 --> 00:38:47,199
Ash, make sure
the bars are in place.

633
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,738
And remember, we need
to make sure this guy believes

634
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:52,539
that this is just a deal
that's gone wrong,

635
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,719
not that he's been conned.
Ok?

636
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,760
So Albert and I will work out
a way of blowing him out clean.

637
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
Meet you at my car.
I'll see you there.

638
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,160
You all right?

639
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,920
Well?

640
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,399
I assume it all checked out.

641
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,519
Good as gold.

642
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,679
So we have a deal?

643
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,679
When and where?

644
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,560
Under the motorway,
same as last time.

645
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,200
One hour.

646
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,360
- You'd better get on to your buyer.
- All right.

647
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,239
Shania!

648
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,280
Get Heinz on the phone. Now!

649
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,319
(Phone rings)

650
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,119
Heinz!
Happy days, we're on.

651
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,039
Barry will bring you to the meeting
point, stick behind us in my car.

652
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,180
I'll be there.
Bring your cheque book.

653
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,800
All right?

654
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,839
You ready? Oh, yeah.
Well, let's get on with it then.

655
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,960
Unless you want a 50-strong special ops
unit dropping in to spoil the party.

656
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,279
He's setting us up!

657
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,959
Whoa! Whoa! No!
No, they're with me!

658
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,400
No! It's all right!
It's all good!

659
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:12,359
It's good as gold. No, see,
they're with me.

660
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,399
That's my lad, Barry.

661
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,719
He's brought my buyer. See,
I'm the middle man, he's the buyer.

662
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,480
He pays me, I pay you,
that's how it works. Ok?

663
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,319
- What do you need?
- See the gold.

664
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,400
Er, we need to see the goods.

665
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,200
Sir?

666
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,320
You'll like this, Heinz.

667
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,760
I verified the gold.

668
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,280
See?
Everyone's happy!

669
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,079
It's all good.

670
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,799
It's just business, that's all.

671
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,959
Freeze! Yo, back up!
Tell him to back up!

672
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,400
It's ok! I'm going
to pay you now.

673
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,160
(He chuckles)

674
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,200
(Rumbling sound)

675
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,560
They're on to us!

676
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:03,159
You nearly got us bloody killed.

677
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,159
I hope our next delivery
is not quite so eventful.

678
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,319
Yeah, sorry about that, Heinz.
But all's well and all that, yeah?

679
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,799
Chin up!

680
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,240
Auf wiedersehen!

681
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,618
Right. Get back to the office,
see how them ads are doing.

682
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:17,819
Can't I come back with you?

683
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,960
No you can't, I've got things to do.
Look, there's a bus stop over there.

684
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,959
Sorry, sir. Closed.

685
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,039
What do you mean it's closed?
It's one o'clock!

686
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,499
I've got a bankers' draft to cash.

687
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,899
- The bank ceased trading at
11.30 this morning, sir. - What!?

688
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,799
I'm not sure of the details,
sir, but the bank's assets

689
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,599
have been seized and
all trading suspended.

690
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,879
But... but... I've got a...

691
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,799
I've got a bankers draft!

692
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,319
Here! Look!
It's a bank draft!

693
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,479
See! They have to pay it!

694
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,560
Like I said, I'm sorry, sir, but
all trading has been suspended.

695
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,199
- Bankers draft or direct transfers.
- Agreed.

696
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,680
Looks like you've found
your uk supplier.

697
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,778
Good. This friend of mine got
two tickets for the archery,

698
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:20,679
he was hacked off - he didn't
know they did archery there.

699
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,479
He said it would've
been all right, though.

700
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,679
Excuse me for just a moment.

701
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,359
Sure.
Sorry.

702
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,879
You talked the talk,
it's time to walk the walk.

703
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,799
There's three mill's worth here,
are you in or are you out?

704
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,799
Ok, we have a deal.

705
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,799
I'll take them all.

706
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:35,559
Good call.
Be in touch.

707
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,399
I can do the paperwork,
but can you handle it?

708
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,039
You've talked the talk,
it's time to walk the walk.

709
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,480
There's three mill's worth
here, are you in or out?

710
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,439
Ok, we have a deal.

711
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,639
- I'll take them all.
- Good call.

712
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,919
Be in touch.

713
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,440
As brilliant as ever you were.

714
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,199
Thank you, Paul.

715
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,039
Shania!

716
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,400
Get Heinz on the phone. Now!

717
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,839
(Phone rings)

718
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,119
Mm-hmm.

719
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,279
'Heinz! Happy days!

720
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,719
'We're on!'

721
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,280
I'll be there.

722
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,360
It's all good.
See? Everyone's happy!

723
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,520
I'd better get this
melted back down.

724
00:46:54,521 --> 00:46:56,239
Ah, but... not this one.

725
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,520
You, eh...
You sure that's the right one?

726
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,239
Thank you.

727
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,759
For you guys, any time.

728
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,240
I knew you were good
but getting the army onside?

729
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:06,560
How did that work?

730
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,799
Can I ask why you're selling?

731
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,039
There's an army base
half a mile away,

732
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:15,879
they're meant to do their
manoeuvres in the next field.

733
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,519
But they keep getting lost
and ending up on my farm.

734
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,719
Every Tuesday and Saturday at noon.
Just like clockwork.

735
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,880
(Alarm bleeps)

736
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,559
Trade secret.

737
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,919
We could tell you
but we'd have to kill you.

738
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,400
Fair enough.

739
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:40,920
We had to change the seal
but it's all there.

740
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,199
- It's done. - All right?
- Let's get rid of Heinz's phone.

741
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,600
Hi.
This is for you.

742
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,279
(Phone rings)

743
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,199
Hello?

744
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,720
Your cheque's no good!
You nicked my gold!

745
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,039
Who is that?

746
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,159
It's Norman.

747
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,280
'Cock-a-doodle-doo.'

748
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,200
'hello?'

749
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,279
'hello?'

750
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,640
'hello!'

751
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,640
'hello?!'

752
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,879
so Eddie's all sorted?

753
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,639
Like it never happened.

754
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:41,239
So what, you apologised, bigged up
liverpool and he swallowed it?

755
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,199
Yeah.

756
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,799
He didn't mention my name?

757
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,759
Let's just say it's forgotten.

758
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,519
Just like that?

759
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,239
I had to use charm, talk him round.
But yeah, he's sweet.

760
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,959
So we can go back in?

761
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,319
- Whenever we like.
- Well done, Sean.

762
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,040
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

763
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,360
(Woman sobs)

764
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,879
So what did you
say to him exactly?

765
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,519
Well...

766
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:11,199
- It was Ash.
- Knew it!

767
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,519
So where is he then?

768
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,480
Come on, you know him.
He's a proud man.

769
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:17,799
I want an apology.
And he wants to apologise.

770
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,640
He just can't bring himself
to do it face-to-face.

771
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,040
So he gave me this.

772
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,639
'A message from Ash.

773
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,639
'I'm sorry for defacing
the photograph

774
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,499
'of the greatest footballer
who ever lived. Ian rush.'

775
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,618
guys, what a lot of people think
west ham went down cos

776
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:44,519
they weren't any good
but that's not true.

777
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,719
No, no. We just went into the
championship for a rest, right,

778
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:52,120
to take a break before we launched
our next assault on the premiership.

779
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,040
So should I say it or not?

780
00:49:56,041 --> 00:49:58,599
Tell him liverpool
are the best team on the planet.

781
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,399
He would definitely go for that.

782
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,279
When he's gone for that and you've
shaken hands, give him a message.

783
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,639
Yeah?
What's that?

784
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,320
Liverpool play like a bunch
of girls and west ham

785
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:07,559
are the only proper team in Europe.

786
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,039
'Liverpool are the only
proper team in Europe.'

787
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,559
(brilliant!)

788
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,759
'Let's be honest. West ham went down
because they weren't good enough.

789
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,879
'Liverpool are the best team
on the planet.

790
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,640
'West ham play like a load of girls

791
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:27,240
'and liverpool are the only
proper team in Europe.'

792
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,559
so we're good?

793
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,080
Come here.

794
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,080
I pretty much told him
exactly what you told me to.

795
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:39,479
I mean, I might not have got it
word for word, but you know.

796
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,840
But you gave him the gist?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

797
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,879
That is a very happy lady.

798
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,240
So what did you tell her?

799
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:52,559
I told her I was an ombudsman
and she'd just been awarded damages.

800
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,439
A very sweet thing for you to do.

801
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,879
Well, thank you all for your help.
Any time.

802
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,159
And the good news is,
we can go back to Eddie's.

803
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,639
Oh?
Yeah, Sean did the business.

804
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,560
Well, what are we waiting for?

805
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,399
Guys! Good to see you, come on in.

806
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,999
So we're ok? Eh?

807
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,839
All forgotten,
not another word.

808
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,599
Bottle of bubbly on ice,
waiting for you. On the house.

809
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,959
Thank you, Eddie!

810
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,280
Cheers, Eddie.
It's ok.

811
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,760
Oh.

812
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,120
All right, ed?

813
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,080
You're a top man, Ash,
you know that?

814
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,200
It's not easy
admitting you're wrong.

815
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,599
No, no, it can't have been.

816
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,800
- Takes a big man to step up
to the plate. - Yes, it does.

817
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,839
Any chance of you letting go now?

818
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,440
Sorry.

819
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,199
Look, I know
you don't like any fuss

820
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,839
but I just want you to know, that...

821
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,640
I respect you...As a man.

822
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,799
And I respect you too, ed.

823
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,159
As a man.

824
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,239
I know you do. I know you do.

825
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,680
So that's it then, yeah, water under
the bridge, not another word? Right.

826
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,640
Right.

827
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,319
Right, shall we open the bottle, or?

828
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,519
Yes, yes.

829
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,079
(Mickey laughs)
Ok, now.

830
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,440
This...ls to a golden future.

831
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,439
Bet you never thought
you'd see me again.

832
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,399
Back off, corporal.

833
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,239
No, we didn't.

834
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,439
Only when you were taking me
into the barn, I heard you talking.

835
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,320
Eddie's isn't the only bar
in London.

836
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,839
Maybe we should just find
somewhere else.

837
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,760
No, no,
we'll find a way to sort it.

838
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,440
It was a bit of a long shot, but...

839
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,040
Tell you the truth, I thought
you'd be long gone by now.

840
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,280
The thing is...

841
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,760
..That half a million quid broke me
and someone's got to pay.

842
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:14,239
So...What do you have in mind?

843
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,600
Ash: Relax.

844
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,040
Look, I haven't got any beef
with you guys.

845
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,799
Sorry?

846
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,399
Ok, you got my money, but that was
business. I understand that.

847
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,840
I got the gold,
I gave it to Heinz, I took a hit.

848
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,920
You kept to your end of the bargain,
I've got no complaints about that.

849
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,080
But that kraut cheated me!

850
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,320
He took my gold and he gave me a
dodgy cheque, now I can't find him.

851
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,839
His office number's unavailable

852
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,920
and some nutcase
has nicked his mobile.

853
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,840
50 grand.

854
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,039
Now, I know you lot
were black ops in the army,

855
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,240
so I thought who better
to help me out.

856
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,319
Black ops?

857
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,520
It's ok.
I know you can't talk about it.

858
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,679
But I know how it works.

859
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,479
I know what you do.

860
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,920
What's that, then?

861
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,919
You get dropped behind enemy lines
to take people out.

862
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,839
Well, that's what I want you to do
to the German.

863
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,680
I want you to track him down for me.

864
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:36,999
His name is Heinz Zimmerman.

865
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,799
I want you to find him,

866
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,319
and I want you to...
Take care of him for me.

867
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,359
"Take care of him?"
You know what I mean.

868
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,400
Oh, yeah. Take care of him.

869
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,719
There's 50 grand there,
there'll be the same again

870
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,360
when you bring him to me.

871
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,560
Or show me a photo...
Of his cold, dead body.

872
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:07,240
Do we have a deal?

873
00:55:07,241 --> 00:55:09,480
Let me get this straight.

874
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:15,079
If we find this Heinz Zimmerman,
take care of him,

875
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:19,800
and show you a photo of that,
you'll give us another 50 thousand?

876
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,160
That's right.

877
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,520
Then you've got a deal.

878
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,560
You know where to find me.

879
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,000
Did that just happen?

880
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,039
Yes, it did. I thought we were
in trouble for a minute.

881
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:57,080
Not to worry, I'm on it.

882
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:13,960
Wait a minute.

883
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,839
Ugh, did you have to put ketchup
on this shirt?

884
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:22,279
With five grand, you can buy a new
shirt. You have to look the part.

885
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,840
Or dead to be precise.

886
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,199
Ok, now, that. No.
Hold that, hold that.

887
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,839
That's fantastic.

888
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,599
I really missed you lot, you know.

889
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,679
Yeah, well, we missed you too, ed.

890
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,000
Did you?
Yeah. Just don't hug me again.

891
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,239
Here's to west ham.

892
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,200
Oh, cheers.

893
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,440
Hang on a minute, you're supposed
to say, "here's to liverpool."

894
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,680
What for?

895
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,999
Well, that's not very nice, is it?

896
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,159
What's the point in apologising
if you behave like that?

897
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,439
But Sean apologised, I didn't.

898
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,999
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't do anything.

899
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,040
What about the cd?

900
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,640
What cd?

901
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,320
'Message from Ash.

902
00:57:11,321 --> 00:57:13,359
'I'm sorry for defacing
the photograph

903
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,599
'of the greatest footballer
who ever lived. Ian rush.'

904
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,639
Ash...

905
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,239
This...

906
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,320
This can be easily explained.

907
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,720
How about two dead bodies
for the price of one.

908
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,760
Only one of 'em will be real...

909
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,360
..Cos I'm going to kill you.

910
00:57:30,361 --> 00:57:31,839
Ash. Sean, just run.

911
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,239
Don't just stand there! Help me!

912
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,999
Ash, don't make me do something
I'm going to regret!

913
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,599
Argh!

914
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,160
That's pretty tight.
That's pretty tight! Ash!

915
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,839
