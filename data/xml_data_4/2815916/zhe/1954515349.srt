马修是个明星环保律师

5
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:16,036
家庭生活如同上过油的机器一般井井有条

6
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:17,070
紧接着
And then...

7
00:00:17,072 --> 00:00:18,955
事情就变了

船长大人 您要见我吗
Captain, you wanted to see me?

什么 那也太棒了
What?! That-That-That's amazing,

16
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:40,060
只是 我不知道能否就这样离开这生我养我的地方
but I-I don't know if I can just uproot my life.

17
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:42,062
就去一年而已 走起
It's only for a year. Carry on.

18
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:45,230
可我都结婚了 还有个孩子
But I'm married and we have a baby

19
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,366
{\a6}Shake Shack是美国街边卖零食的连锁店

19
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,866
而且我们那边刚开了一家奶昔小站
and they just opened a Shake Shack on our block

20
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:47,767
而且从来都不用排队

21
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:49,035
我明白这决定事关重大
I understand it's a big decision.

22
00:00:49,037 --> 00:00:50,453
给你足够时间慢慢考虑
Take all the time you need.

23
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:52,872
只要在今天结束之前告诉我就行
Just let me know by the end of the day.

我才没有"简直是"刚过来
I didn't "Literally" Just get here.

32
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:18,481
我真心痛恨总有人老是滥用那个词

好吧 行 现在我真的要走了
Okay, fine, now I'm leaving.

37
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:30,042
人们到底为什么要来酒吧
Why do people go to a bar, anyway?

38
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,778
喝上两杯啤酒 扒下女人裤子
To get your drink on and some girl's pants off.

39
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,613
这两样我在家都能办到
I can do both at home.

40
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:37,900
你看什么呢
What are you looking at?

41
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:39,118
那个穿大衣的妹子
The girl in the big coat?

42
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,619
我俩之前一起上过同一节瑜伽课
We were in the same yoga class together.

43
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:44,073
你有没有觉得 有些时候你遇见一个姑娘
You know how sometimes you'll meet a girl and there'll be

44
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:46,225
她不经意间表现出的一点点特质
that one bewitching little detail that'll make you

45
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,294
就能让你一瞬间爱上她
fall in love with her instantly?

46
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:50,463
比如 鼻子上的小雀斑
You know, a little freckle on the nose,

47
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:51,647
轻快活泼的笑声
the-the lilt of her laugh,

48
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:53,966
还有她说出某个词时的那种音调
the way she pronounces a certain word or phrase?

49
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,801
是啊 当然了
Sure, totally.

50
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,186
好吧 对于这个姑娘来说
Well, in this girl's case,

51
00:01:57,188 --> 00:02:00,323
她那一点点的特质就是
the bewitching little detail is the fact

52
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:03,476
她有一个"八可思议"的火爆身材
that she has just a "Redonkulous" Body.

53
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,810
八可思议
Redonkulous?

54
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:06,028
八可思议
Redonkulous!

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,414
我只听过你用"八可思议"这个词来形容
I've only heard you use "Redonkulous" To describe

56
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,383
《碟中谍4: 幽灵协议》

00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,751
巴尼 这个姑娘
Barney, this girl has

58
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:16,873
有着如碟中谍般八可思议的身材
the Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol of bodies.

58
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:16,873
{\a6}碟中谍英文直译为 不可能的任务

59
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,708
哇哦
Whoa.

60
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,793
你就等她把大衣脱下来吧
Just wait till she takes that coat off.

61
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,829
等下 你刚刚都打算走了 不是吗
Oh, wait, sorry, you were just about to leave, right?

62
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:26,048
就是 这酒钱我花都花了
I mean, I've already paid for this drink.

63
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,303
伙计们 船长大人刚提了一件很有意思的事
Guys, The Captain just made me a very interesting offer.

64
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:32,855
哎呦 我们可算知道他为什么雇你了
Finally, we get around to the real reason he hired you.

65
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:35,391
你就答应他你会拍的 而且一定要用三脚架
Just promise you film it, and please use a tripod.

66
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:36,526
没有防抖毫无艺术感可言
There's nothing artistic about shaky-cam.

67
00:02:36,528 --> 00:02:38,060
那样看起来软塌塌的
It just looks sloppy.

68
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:42,114
他想让我跟他去罗马待上一年 帮他买入艺术品
He wants me to move to Rome for a year to buy art for him.

70
00:02:42,116 --> 00:02:43,282
哇 真的吗
Whoa! Seriously?

71
00:02:43,284 --> 00:02:45,117
-那是你想要做的事情吗  -开玩笑吧你
-Is that something you want to do? -Are you kidding?

72
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,852
我一直以来都想在国外生活
I've always wanted to live abroad!

73
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:50,456
我上大学时 在巴黎度过的夏天令人茅塞顿开
My summer in Paris, back in college, was so enlightening:

74
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:53,859
艺术啊 历史啊 还有免费的奶酪啊
the art, the history, the free cheese

75
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,495
穿件低胸装就能吃到
just for wearing a low-cut top.

76
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:57,547
马修对于你们搬家是什么态度
Well, how does Marshall feel about moving?

77
00:02:57,549 --> 00:02:59,048
我还没跟他说呢
I haven't told him yet.

78
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,866
他真的很喜欢在这里的工作
He really loves his job here.

79
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:02,585
是啊 可他也同样喜欢意大利
Yeah, but he also loves Italy!

80
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,837
他在大学里学了一周的意大利语课
He took a week of Italian in college,

81
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:07,006
而且他放弃这门课的唯一原因是
and the only reason he dropped it was

82
00:03:07,008 --> 00:03:09,642
因为他对不能飘飘欲仙很反感
'cause he had a conflict... with being not stoned.

83
00:03:09,644 --> 00:03:12,762
可他到现在还记得怎么说这句话
But he still knows how to say the phrase,

84
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:15,765
"拜托 老兄 别独占所有洋葱圈"
"Come on, bro, don't Bogart all the Funyuns."

85
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:18,484
好吧 我这就给他打电话
All right, I'm gonna call him.

86
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,437
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

87
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,155
嘿 宝贝 现在没法讲话

忙着大案子呢 拜 
I'm working on a big case. Bye.

89

那个时候莉莉突然明白
And that's when Lily realized

90
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,444
搬到罗马去意味着什么
what moving to Rome would really mean.

92
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:55,756
季诺•卡维里尼 下来参赛吧

92
00:03:56,256 --> 00:03:57,756
不知不觉之间
And before you know it...

93
00:03:57,758 --> 00:03:59,308
他的生活就变成一部充满焦虑感的
...his life turns into an angsty,

94
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,394
意大利存在主义黑白电影
existential black-and-white Italian movie.

95
00:04:01,396 --> 00:04:02,895
正是如此
Exactly.

96
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,600
　\N你是做什么的


96
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,245
我以前是个律师
I used to be a lawyer.

97
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:20,800
　\N你现在做什么呢

97
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:24,884
我不知道了
I don't know anymore.

98
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,800
　\N咱俩为什么不搬到明尼苏达

98
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,300
　\N我好学习你妈妈的菜谱

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
　\N给你做砂锅火腿

98
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,566
不好意思 我暂停一下
I'm sorry. I got to hit pause for a second.

99
00:04:40,568 --> 00:04:42,518
这里怎么会这么热
Why is it so hot in here?

100
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,604
噢 是的 当你在一刻不停 喋喋不休于
Oh, right. While you were blabbering on and on

101
00:04:44,606 --> 00:04:46,138
你那堆什么乱七八糟的生活危机的时候
about your whole life crisis or whatever,

102
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,807
我偷偷给了卡尔100刀 好让他把暖气开大
I slipped Carl a hundred to turn the heat up in here.

103
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:49,909
什么 为什么呢
What? Why?

104
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:53,479
因为她还穿着那件肥得要死的大衣
Because she is still in the big puffy coat!

105
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:55,831
巴尼 你现在算是唱的哪出啊
Barney, what are you doing?

106
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,316
我要让她脱掉那件大衣
I'm trying her out of that coat,

107
00:04:57,318 --> 00:04:58,200
我唱的就是这出
that's what I'm doing!

108
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,452
我在以热攻辣
I'm fighting hotness with hotness!

109
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:00,653
你都订婚了
You're engaged.

110
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:03,205
好吧 莉莉 很明显你好像忘了点啥事
Okay, Lily, clearly you're forgetting something.

111
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:06,425
是啊 我跟地球上最棒的女孩订婚了
Yes, I'm engaged to the coolest girl on Earth.

112
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:08,260
我这只不过是看看而已 又不碰她
This is about looking, not touching.

113
00:05:08,262 --> 00:05:11,213
罗宾明白我有一对球球是她不能用领带
Robin understands there is one set of balls she can't tie up

114
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,216
系起来 用乒乓球拍轻击之的
with a necktie and lightly hit with a Ping-Pong paddle.

115
00:05:14,218 --> 00:05:15,635
就是这对眼球
These balls.

116
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:17,169
好了 我要打电话给船长
Okay, I'm gonna call The Captain,

117
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,505
把这档子事定下来
get this over with.

118
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,975
啊嗬
Ahoy.

119
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:23,809
你好 船长
Hello, Captain?

120
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:26,011
莉莉 我希望你这通电话打来不是
Lily, I hope you're not calling

121
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,863
一叉子把咱们去罗马的计划给毙了的
to harpoon our big move to Rome.

122
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,867
谢谢你 但我不能让我的丈夫放弃他的事业
Thank you, but I can't ask my husband to abandon his career.

123
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:33,852
你想要我试着去说服他吗
Would you like me to try and convince him?

124
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,471
我很会当说客的
I'm very persuasive.

125
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,523
不好意思 船已经起航
I'm sorry, the ship has sailed.

126
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:39,141
什么意思
What's that mean?

127
00:05:39,143 --> 00:05:42,328
额 你懂的 "船已经起航"
Well, you know, "The ship has sailed"?

128
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,380
意思就是事情已经尘埃落定 不可改变
That it's over and there's nothing you can do?

129
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:46,465
真是奇怪的表达呢 唔
What a peculiar expression. Hmm.

130
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:48,867
好吧 谢谢你辛苦的工作 莉莉
Well, thanks for all your hard work, Lily.

131
00:05:48,869 --> 00:05:50,536
我从不擅长做道别 所以...
I've never been good at good-byes, so...

132
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:53,205
好吧 就这样结束了
Well, that's that.

133
00:05:53,207 --> 00:05:55,925
我梦想的艺术顾问这工作就这么结束了
My dream job as an art consultant is over.

134
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:57,093
而可悲的部分是...
And the sad part...

135
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,044
好了 我得打断你一下 莉莉
Okay, I gotta stop you right there, Lily,

136
00:05:59,046 --> 00:06:02,231
因为除非我弄错了 准备好了绅士们
'cause unless I'm mistaken, lock and load gentlemen.

137
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,553
围巾 不是吧 别穿啊 脱啊
A scarf?! No, don't put on, take off!

138
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:09,555
够了 你都开始流口水了
Okay, you're starting to drool.

139
00:06:09,557 --> 00:06:11,157
太猥琐了
I'm calling creepy.

140
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,074
莉莉 还好啦
Lily, it's fine.

141
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,559
这是个纯学术问题
This is purely academic.

142
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,195
这就像在赏鸟
It's-It's like bird-watching.

143
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,448
现在 我只是在观赏一对极品豪...罗宾
And right now, I am watching a double-breasted-- Robin!

143
00:06:16,197 --> 00:06:19,448
{\a6}robin有知更鸟的意思

144
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:24,086
等一下 她们认识
Wait-- they know each other?!

145
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:25,504
哇哦 等等 到底咋回事
Whoa, wait-- what is going on here?

146
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,456
噢 天啊 真的发生了
Oh, my God, it's happening.

147
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,708
就跟我预想的一样
This is just like I imagined.

148
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,761
在泰德的面前 这样我可以当面羞辱他
Right in front of Ted, so I can rub it in his face.

149
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:32,911
那腰带是我的
The belt is mine!

149
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:34,911
{\a6}S03E03中泰德和巴尼打赌 第一个完成3P的将得到腰带

150
00:06:32,913 --> 00:06:36,132
嗨 伙计们 巴尼 你记得莉迪吧
Hi, guys. Barney, you remember Liddy.

151
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:37,916
是吗
I do?

152
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:40,136
对 莉比
Yes! Libby.

153
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,021
是莉迪 罗宾雇我的时候我们见过面的
Liddy. We met when Robin hired me.

154
00:06:42,023 --> 00:06:42,972
罗宾雇你了
Robin hired you?

155
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:44,473
真调皮 好吧
Naughty girl. Okay.

156
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,475
好了 事情应该怎么办呢
Okay, so how's this gonna go down?

157
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:48,894
你们俩先开始搞 然后我在中途插进来
You two just gonna start, and I'll just jump in?

158
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:52,565
呃 她是我们的婚礼策划人
Uh, she's our wedding planner.

159
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,367
她当然是婚礼策划人啦
Of course she's the wedding planner!

160
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:57,203
很高兴再见到你 莉比
Good to see you again, Libby.

161
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,788
莉迪 对
Liddy. Yeah.

162
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,241
嘿 我是泰德 我们 呃 我们之前见过
Hey, I'm Ted. We, uh, we met once before.

163
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:04,460
噢 对 在瑜伽课上 你好吗
Oh, right, in yoga class. How are you?

164
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:07,213
她刚跟我讲话了呢
She's talking to me.

165
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:09,582
我很想呆在这
Well, I would love to stay,

166
00:07:09,584 --> 00:07:11,050
既然现在我算是失业了
but now that I'm unemployed,

167
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:13,502
我要去给工作中的马修一个惊喜
I think I'll go surprise Marshall at work.

168
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:16,639
婚礼策划人
Wedding planner.

169
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:20,626
于是 莉莉去马修那儿探班了
So Lily went to visit Marshall at work,

170
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:22,394
希望自己不会打扰到什么重要的事情
hoping she wasn't interrupting anything important.

171
00:07:22,396 --> 00:07:24,313
她没有打扰到
She wasn't.

172
00:07:24,315 --> 00:07:28,267
哦 什么情况
Whoa. What is going on?

173
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,703
伯纳德 如果我们把卡片粘在一起
Bernard, if we just glue the cards together...

174
00:07:30,705 --> 00:07:33,305
莉莉 你来这干嘛呀
Lily! What are you doing here?

175
00:07:33,307 --> 00:07:34,490
呃 我给你烤了布朗尼
Well, I baked you brownies

176
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:36,809
因为我以为你在忙工作
because I thought you were busy working, but...

177
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:38,611
当你说...
so when you said...

178
00:07:38,613 --> 00:07:40,079
莉莉 嘿 我现在不方便说话
Lily, hey, I can't really talk.

179
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:42,164
我现在在做一个大项目
I'm working on a big project right now.

180
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:43,532
实在是个很难完成项目
It's a real house of cards.

181
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:46,585
这就是你说的"很难完成项目"
Is this the "House of cards" You were talking about?

181
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:47,785
{\a6}house of cards双关 卡片屋

182
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:50,005
我还以为你有个什么大客户呢
I thought you had some big client.

183
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,509
噢 亲爱的 我们已经几个月没客户了
Oh, sweetheart, we haven't had a client here in months.

184
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:56,545
嗯 布朗尼 不错嘛
Mmm! Brownies! Hey!

185
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:03,504
到底怎么了 你说几个月
What is going on? What do you mean

186
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,507
都没有客户了是什么意思
you haven't had a client in months?

187
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,292
自从格鲁伯案子之后
Ever since the Gruber case,

188
00:08:07,294 --> 00:08:09,094
我们一落千丈
we lost a lot of business,

189
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:12,414
大家都走人了 现在就剩我和伯纳德
people got laid off... it's just me and Bernard now.

190
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,482
库茨呢
Where's Cootes?

191
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:15,717
他穴居在科罗拉多的防空洞
He's holed up in a bomb shelter in Colorado,

192
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:18,636
拾掇着自己的香草园坐等末日
waiting for the apocalypse and tending to his herb garden.

193
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:21,806
那么过去的几个月我给你打电话
So all those times I've called you in the past few months,

194
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:24,943
你说你忙的不得了
when you talked about how busy you were...

195
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:26,528
那些都是在骗我咯
you were just lying to me?

196
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,030
严格地说 我从没骗过你
Technically, I never lied...

197
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:31,700
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

198
00:08:31,702 --> 00:08:33,335
嘿 宝贝 我现在不方便说话
Hey, baby, I can't talk right now.

199
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:35,921
忙着大案子呢 拜 
I'm working on a big case. Bye.

200
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,826
这真心是一大箱子啊
That is a big case.

200
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:41,826
{\a6}case有箱子和案子两个意思

201
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:43,595
现在不是时候 莉莉
Bad time, Lily.

202
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:45,013
我得专心应对客户
I got to focus on the client.

203
00:08:45,015 --> 00:08:46,214
挂了 再见
Gotta go. Bye.

204
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:48,600
我们说到哪啦
Where were we?

204
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,018
{\a6}书名 客户

205
00:08:48,602 --> 00:08:50,018
第十九章
Chapter 19.

206
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,504
我现在没法儿聊天 我的台面都铺满了
I can't talk right now; I got a lot on my plate.

207
00:08:53,506 --> 00:08:55,724
好 开吃吧
Well, let's dig in.

208
00:08:55,726 --> 00:08:58,109
要是我们现在开始 午饭之前就能吃完
If we start now, we can be done by lunch.

209
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,896
这会儿没空 莉莉
Now's not a good time, Lily.

210
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,316
这儿没人能腾出手来
We got a lot of balls in the air right now.

211
00:09:04,318 --> 00:09:07,035
好的 把订书机扔给我
Okay, toss me the stapler.

212
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:09,905
简直不敢相信
Unbelievable.

213
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,491
等下 你告诉我说你就要击垮别人了...
Wait-- when you said you were about to get reamed...

214
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,660
哦 对 那个
Oh, right. That.

215
00:09:15,662 --> 00:09:16,878
有时候 为了找乐子
No, sometimes, for fun,

216
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,997
我们互相扔纸玩
We throw reams of paper at each other.

217
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,083
伯纳德 这会儿不是时候
Bernard! Not a good time!

218
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,669
有点眼色好不好
Read the room!

219
00:09:24,671 --> 00:09:26,755
很抱歉 宝贝 我
I'm sorry, baby, I...

220
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:28,974
我不想让你目睹我的失败
I didn't want you to see me fail.

221
00:09:28,976 --> 00:09:32,844
该死 你知道你的谎言带来了多严重的后果吗
Damn it! Do you realize what you cost us by lying to me?

222
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,479
船长要搬去罗马
The Captain is moving to Rome,

223
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:37,515
他邀请我 作为他的艺术顾问与他同行
and he offered to bring me along as his art consultant,

224
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:40,185
但是我拒绝了 因为我以为你爱你的工作
but I turned it down, because I thought you loved your job.

225
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:42,070
哦 我滴天啊
Oh, my gosh.

226
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:43,738
如果我们去意大利
If we lived in Italy,

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,074
我就可以整天照顾马尔文
I could just spend my days taking care of Marvin

228
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:50,228
学做意大利面 看意大利版价格猜猜猜
and trying to make pasta and watching Italian Price Is Right.

229
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,780
简直跟做梦一样
It sounds like a dream!

230
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:52,747
哦 已经太晚了
Oh, it's too late.

231
00:09:52,749 --> 00:09:54,232
不 没有 莉莉
No, no. Lily, 

232
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:55,617
我现在就去找船长
I'm going to The Captain's right now!

233
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,168
我要亡羊补牢
I'm gonna make this right!

234
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,253
我会让你拿回那份工作的
I'm gonna get you that job!

235
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,455
-不要了 马修  -你会拿回那份工作的
-No, Marshall... -You're getting that job!

236
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:02,908
你可以写给莉迪•盖茨
You can just make it out to Liddy Gates.

237
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,843
拼写是L-I-D-D-Y 
That's L-I-D-D-Y.

238
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:06,544
L-I 两个D
L-I, two D's...

239
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,745
一对儿D
double D...

239
00:10:06,546 --> 00:10:07,745
{\a6}请自行脑补内衣尺码

240
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,265
两个D...Y
two D's... -Y.

240
00:10:07,747 --> 00:10:10,265
{\a6}Y谐音 为什么啊

241
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,884
好了 这是最终的菜单 我们之前讨论过的
Well, here is the final menu, as we discussed,

242
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,135
强调一下
but let me be clear.

243
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:15,804
你们是老板 我是为你们服务的
You're the boss; I'm here to serve you.

244
00:10:15,806 --> 00:10:17,806
所以如果有你们不想要的东西
So if there's anything you want me to remove,

245
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,824
就直接跟我讲 我立马给你们去掉
just tell me to remove it and it's gone.

246
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,443
你们不想要的我一件不留
I'll remove anything you want.

252
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:22,228
{\a6}男人们都在想去掉她的大衣

247
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:22,228
这听上去很合理
That sounds like a sound policy.

248
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,061
这取决于你 你喜欢什么样的 
Up to you, whatever you feel like.

249
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:24,229
这挺好... 你告诉我这些非常好
That's a good... That's a good thing to know.

250
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:26,032
没关系 你想去掉什么就去掉什么
That's fine, you can remove whatever you want.

251
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:28,433
我是认真的 我不会觉得这是冒犯 你们不想要的
I'm serious, and I won't be offended; you want it gone,

252
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:34,239
{\a6}男人们还是在想去掉她的大衣

252
00:10:28,435 --> 00:10:30,902
我立马去掉 这是很热吗
I'll take it right off. Is it hot in here?

253
00:10:30,904 --> 00:10:32,570
不算冷 你知道吗
It's not cold. You know what?

254
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,239
是很热 粘粘的 没有... 就好像
It's hot; it's sticky. It's not... It's like

255
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:35,940
高温瑜珈一样 对吧
Bikram, right?

256
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:37,409
我们是瑜伽之友
We're yoga buddies.

257
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,961
瑜珈之友啊
Yoga buddies.

258
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,548
好的 你们看看菜单
Well, I'll let you guys read the menu.

259
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,717
-麻烦问下...  -找衣帽架吗×2
-Can you point me to the... -Coat rack?

260
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:46,918
...洗手间在哪
...restroom?

261
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,803
呃 就在那边
Uh, it's right over there.

262
00:10:48,805 --> 00:10:50,972
但是穿着那么大的大衣尿尿很不方便啊
But it's hard to pee in a giant coat.

263
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:53,425
好吧 这是怎么了
Okay, what's going on?

264
00:10:53,427 --> 00:10:54,843
你们怎么都这么奇怪
Why are you guys being so weird?

265
00:10:54,845 --> 00:10:58,930
泰德说莉迪的身材八可思议
Ted says that Liddy has a ridonkulous body,

266
00:10:58,932 --> 00:10:59,665
但是现在没办法证实
but there's no way of verifying

267
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,517
因为她就是不脱掉大衣
because she won't take off the coat!

268
00:11:01,518 --> 00:11:03,101
所以这儿的温度才这么高的吗
Is that why it's so hot in here?

269
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,387
你又花钱让卡尔把暖气调高了哈
Did you pay Carl to turn up the heat again?

270
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:07,489
嗯 没错
Well, yes.

271
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,658
不过我只是好奇
But I was curious.

272
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,443
我想把那件大衣搭到架子上面
I want to get that coat on the rack

273
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,328
{\a6}rack同时有一对咪咪和架子的意思

273
00:11:11,445 --> 00:11:13,328
好看看大衣里面的那对东西
so I can see the rack that's under the coat.

274
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,579
我的天哪
My God.

275
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:17,615
我一直在想
I have been wondering

276
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:19,284
同一件事
the same thing.

277
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,202
我是说 她从来都不脱那件大衣
I mean, she never takes that coat off.

278
00:11:21,204 --> 00:11:22,537
无论她那下面藏了什么
Whatever she's smuggling under there

279
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,988
都得前方高能反应预警
has to be thermonuclear.

280
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,791
我打赌她有破内胸
I bet she has WBDs.

281
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,044
破坏内衣之胸器
Weapons of bra destruction.

282
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:30,661
谢谢
Thank you.

283
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,047
这就是为什么
This, this is why

284
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,265
你是史上最赞未婚妻 没有之一
you're the coolest fiancee ever.

285
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:40,505
所以 泰德 你说八可思议...
So, Ted, when you say ridonkulous...

286
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:42,190
我无法描述
I can't even describe it.

287
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,860
这就跟给盲人描述彩虹一样
It'd be like trying to explain a rainbow to a blind person.

288
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,512
她单身吗
Is she single?

289
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:48,679
你怎么不约她出来
Why don't you ask her out?

290
00:11:48,681 --> 00:11:51,533
其实 我们第一次见面我差点可以把她约出去了
Actually, I almost did the first time we met,

291
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:54,953
要不是她脱掉那件大衣的话
before she took off that coat.

292
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:56,187
沙尘暴
Sandstorm?

293
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:58,490
{\a6}均是电影碟中谍4里面的镜头

293
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:58,490
迪拜 那个帽衫吗
Dubai? That hoodie?

294
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,041
我觉得 简直八可思议
I mean, it's ridonkulous.

295
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:02,043
哦 我知道 我真想再看一遍
Oh, I know. I so want to see it again.

296
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:03,611
哟 那下课以后
Well, hey, I mean, maybe after this,

297
00:12:03,613 --> 00:12:04,796
如果你没有其它安排的话
if you're not doing anything.

298
00:12:04,798 --> 00:12:06,197
没问题 也许看完之后
Totally, and maybe later,

299
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,532
我们还能吃些东西
we could get a bite to eat.

300
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:09,884
就在这跟前有个特别棒的饭店
There's this great place that's super close.

301
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:12,754
不
No, I...

302
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:14,055
我... 不
No, I... No.

303
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:15,640
一下子信息量太大了
It was just too much.

304
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,760
印第安纳•琼斯也不敢直视她的身姿
Indiana Jones wouldn't look at this body.

304
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:18,760
{\a6}电影夺宝奇兵男主角

305
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:22,347
这个身姿足以融化纳粹的脸
This is a body that would melt a Nazi's face.

306
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:25,817
哦 伙计 让我的脸也化了吧
Oh, man, I want my face to melt.

307
00:12:25,819 --> 00:12:28,386
真可惜马修不在这儿
It's too bad Marshall isn't here.

308
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,788
为什么
Why Marshall?

309
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,055
因为他能很自然的说
'Cause he could just say...

310
00:12:31,057 --> 00:12:32,123
嘿 莉迪
Hey, Liddy,

311
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,908
干嘛不把大衣脱掉呢
why don't you take off that coat?

312
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,026
莉迪就会
And Liddy would be all...

313
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:36,611
行啊 把上衣也脱掉吗
Sure, should I take my shirt off, too?

314
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:38,029
不用 只脱大衣就行
No, the coat's probably enough.

315
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,081
而且完全能置身事外
And he'd get away with it.

316
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,866
知道为什么吗 他不臭臭
You know why? No stink.

317
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,953
显然你没和打完篮球的他共乘过出租车
You obviously haven't split a cab with him after basketball.

318
00:12:45,671 --> 00:12:46,737
不是 我不是说
No, I don't mean

319
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:47,789
"生理上的臭味"
"Physical stink."

320
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,073
我是指信息素方面
I mean the pheromonal stink

321
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:51,509
当你渴求性交到了可悲的程度
a guy gives off when he's desperate for action

322
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,794
就会散发出这种气息
to a pathetic degree.

323
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:54,412
比如 泰德
You know, like Ted.

324
00:12:54,414 --> 00:12:55,580
我都发臭了吗
I have stink?

325
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,465
哥们 你都泡臭水里了
Bro, you dipped in stink.

326
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,384
如果莉迪回来 你跟她说
If Liddy came back to the table and you said...

327
00:12:59,386 --> 00:13:00,468
呃 莉迪
Uh, Liddy,

328
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,587
你干嘛不脱掉大衣呢
why don't you, uh, take off that coat?

329
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:03,754
你还想让我脱大衣
You want me to take my coat off?

330
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,390
倒不如 我撕烂你的脸
How about instead, I take off your face?

331
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:06,591
嗷
Ow!

332
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:07,725
嗷哦
Ow, oh!

333
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:08,893
说真的
Really?

334
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,612
你就非得让她打我一顿
You had to have her beat me up?

335
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:11,896
还没完呢 泰德
She's not done, Ted.

336
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,548
幽灵协议
Ghost Protocol

336
00:13:11,898 --> 00:13:13,548
{\a6}电影碟中谍4

337
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,933
没有 那么 好看
wasn't that good!

338
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:18,570
另一方面 如果是马修
Marshall, on the other hand,

339
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:20,872
姑娘们看一眼就知道
girls take one look and just know

340
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,708
他已经邂逅了自己的梦中情人
there's a guy who's met the girl of his dreams

341
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,710
想要与其共度余生
and wants to spend the rest of his life

342
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:27,295
海枯石烂 忠贞不渝
with her and only her.

343
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,913
那你怎么不问她
So why don't you ask her?

344
00:13:28,915 --> 00:13:30,114
什么
Pardon me?

345
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:31,049
您难道不是
Aren't you

346
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,383
邂逅了
a guy who's met

347
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:34,252
梦中情人 并想共度余生
the girl of his dreams and wants to spend

348
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,954
海枯石烂 忠贞不渝的人吗
the rest of his life with her and only her?

349
00:13:36,956 --> 00:13:39,757
我当然是啦 宝贝
Of course, baby.

350
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,310
那为什么不能是你叫她脱掉大衣呢
So why don't you ask her to take her coat off?

351
00:13:44,814 --> 00:13:46,981
呃
Um...

352
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:51,603
而且你从来就没看过幽灵协议
And you never even saw Ghost Protocol.

353
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,272
你们的大日子就要到了
So, the big day's coming up.

354
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:56,357
感觉怎么样
How are you guys feeling?

355
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:57,692
我跟备办酒席的人讨论过了
I talked to the caterer,

356
00:13:57,694 --> 00:13:59,744
迷你羊小腿会很美味哦
and the mini lamb shanks are gonna be amazing.

357
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:00,778
哦 对了
Oh, by the way,

358
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,363
我还联系了花店 那些紫罗兰
I talked to the florist, and the violets

359
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:04,282
-也会很漂亮哟  -行的 巴尼 你能做到的
-are gonna be gorgeous. -Okay, Barney. You can do this.

360
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,834
说出来就行 说吧
Just say it. Say it.

361
00:14:05,836 --> 00:14:07,252
大的小的都是
...little ones and big ones...

362
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:08,503
快说
Say it.

363
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:11,789
嘿 莉迪 你要脱掉大衣吗
Hey, Liddy, do you want to take off your coat?

364
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:18,329
行啊
Sure.

365
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:20,849
我做到啦 我向自己和他人证明了
I did it! I proved to myself and everyone else

366
00:14:20,851 --> 00:14:23,268
我根本没有觊觎其他女人
that I have no desire to be with any other woman.

367
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,854
我对其他女人完全免疫了
I am completely immune to every other...

368
00:14:28,107 --> 00:14:30,141
我滴神啊
Holy crap!

369
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,312
这还真的是
And it was, indeed,

370
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,446
八可思议
ridonkulous.

371
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:38,149
我们能见到这等奇观
And we got to see it, all thanks

372
00:14:38,151 --> 00:14:39,567
全都要感谢这位美女
to this lovely lady right here.

373
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:42,704
罗宾 感谢你 我现在可以走近任何姑娘
Robin, thanks to you, I can now walk up to any girl

374
00:14:42,706 --> 00:14:45,123
说我想说的任何猥琐又恶心的话
and say whatever creepy, disgusting thing I want

375
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,457
还能完全置身事外
and totally get away with it.

376
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:47,525
哈
Mm. Man!

377
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,827
我开始喜欢结婚了
I think I'm gonna like being married.

378
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:52,697
喂
Hello?

379
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:54,799
啊嗬
Ahoy.

380
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,200
啊嗬 莉莉
Ahoy, Lily.

381
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,086
我刚和你丈夫长谈了一番
I just had a long talk with your husband.

382
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,922
他说服我再次给你去罗马工作的机会
He convinced me to offer you that job in Rome again.

383
00:15:00,924 --> 00:15:02,473
你怎么说
How do you respond?

384
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:07,262
谢谢 但是我还是拒绝
Thanks, but the answer is still no.

385
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:16,005
莉莉 你怎么又把这事儿推掉了
Lily, why the hell did you turn that down again.

386
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:19,278
因为... 我还得去拍新的护照照片
Because I 'd have to get a new passport photo.

387
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,874
我会错过八月份的纽约
And I'd miss out on New York in August.

388
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,301 
而且我们那边新开了一家奶昔小站 所以...
And plus they open the shake shack on a block. So...

389
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:26,650
莉莉 真正的原因是什么
Lily, what's the real reason?

390
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:29,757
万一我们搬去了罗马
What if we moved to Rome...

391
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,618
什么事这么好笑
What's so funny?

392
00:15:39,643 --> 00:15:40,781
不好意思
I'm sorry.

393
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,537
我不敢相信你花了一千万欧元买这幅画
I can't believe you paid a 10 million euro for this painting.

394
00:15:44,562 --> 00:15:45,462
有什么问题
Why not?

395
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:46,855
这根本就不是一幅画
Because it's not even a painting.

396
00:15:47,095 --> 00:15:49,491
我就转转盘子 然后调料就沾到画布上了
I spinned my plate, the sughi fell out on a blank canvas.

397
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,981
闻闻 是厕所味儿吧
Smell it. It's like a toilet.

398
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,467
我把你变成了一个 呃
I just make you look uh

399
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,182
大蠢蛋
stupido.

400
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,669
莉莉 你被解雇了
Lily, you're fired.

401
00:15:57,694 --> 00:16:00,608
什么 别啊 这还是一幅很棒的画作啊
What? But no. I-I...it's still a great painting.

402
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:03,448
我喜欢它表现出的社会结构
I like what it says about the structure in society

403
00:16:03,473 --> 00:16:04,954
以及妇女角色的转变
and the changing worlds of women.

16
00:16:04,954 --> 00:16:06,954
夺门怒驶出

17
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:15,954
　\N你是做什么工作的

404
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:18,816
我以前是一个艺术顾问
I used to be an art consultant.

19
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:22,416
　\N我老公以前娶过一个艺术顾问

20
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:23,901
　\N他来了

405
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,874
嘿 宝贝儿 是时候给马尔文来一瓶了
Hey baby. It's time for Marvin's bottle.

406
00:16:31,193 --> 00:16:33,527
这都是因为我搞砸了
And it's all because I screwed up and through away

407
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,723
抛弃了如此舒适的纽约生活
a perfectly comfortable life here in New York.

408
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:37,753
莉莉 你不会搞砸的
Lily, you're not going to screw up.

409
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:38,952
好了 求别说了
You know what, just please,

410
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,269
别管这事儿了
just leave it alone.

411
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:41,454
再说了
Besides,

412
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:42,706
其实我心里知道
deep down, I don't think

413
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,549
马修肯定一点也不想去意大利
Marshall's even excited about Italy.

414
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,785
与此同时 在小意大利区
At that very moment in little Italy.

414
00:16:44,574 --> 00:16:46,785
{\a6}小意大利 美国大城市中的意大利移民区

414
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:03,272
泰德:快回家 莉莉又把工作拒绝了

415
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,895
栗子
Marron!

415
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,895
{\a6}马修外语水平真可观

416
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,814
我太期待我的婚礼了
I can't wait for my wedding day.

417
00:17:07,816 --> 00:17:09,683
我是说 到时候
I mean, there is no way

418
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:12,652
莉迪肯定不会还穿着那件大衣了 对吧
that Liddy is gonna be wearing that coat, right?

419
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:13,737
对吧
Right?

420
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:15,655
巴尼•斯丁森 你愿意
"Barney Stinson, do you hope

421
00:17:15,657 --> 00:17:17,857
让她穿着紧身露背装吗
she wears something slinky and backless?"

422
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,160
我愿意
"I do."

423
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:24,581
好了 作为你的伴郎 我能说一句吗
Okay, can I just say something as your best man?

424
00:17:25,249 --> 00:17:26,533
小心点
Be careful.

425
00:17:26,535 --> 00:17:27,817
你什么意思
What do you mean?

426
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,669
你只是... 最近表现得不太像一个
You just... you haven't been acting like a guy

427
00:17:29,671 --> 00:17:31,988
马上要结婚的男人 我知道你觉得这没什么
who's about to get married, and I know you think it's okay

428
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,840
因为罗宾真的很赞 但我要告诉你
because Robin's so cool, but I'm telling you,

429
00:17:33,842 --> 00:17:36,492
她没你想象的那么通情达理
she's not as cool as you think she is.

430
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:39,112
哦 我明白了
Oh, I see.

431
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,131
你知道这点
And you'd know this

432
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:43,332
是因为你比我更了解罗宾
because you know Robin better than I do.

433
00:17:43,334 --> 00:17:46,836
你比她的未婚夫更了解她想要什么
You know what she appreciates better than her own fiance.

434
00:17:46,838 --> 00:17:47,837
我只是想说
I'm just saying,

435
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,355
如果我在三周以后就要结婚了...
if I was getting married in three weeks...

436
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:51,024
但三周以后要结婚不是你 泰德
But you're not getting married in three weeks, Ted.

437
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,308
是我
I am.

438
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,561
罗宾要跟我结婚 不是你
Robin's marrying me, not you.

439
00:17:56,397 --> 00:17:58,148
你说的对
You're right.

440
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,783
我没资格说这些
Not my place.

441
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,818
下一轮我来请吧
Why don't I get the next round?

442
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,994
那么 你还要把你梦寐以求的工作拒绝多少次
So... how many times are you gonna say no to your dream job?

443
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,929
我只是想计划一下我的日程
I'm just trying to plan my day.

444
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:15,131
我是个胆小鬼
I'm a scaredy-cat, okay?

445
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:16,499
我想要成为那种
I want to be the type

446
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:20,170
可以无所畏惧地冲向未知世界的人
of person that just charges fearlessly into the unknown,

448
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:22,472
但我那次提前两周就从巴黎回来了
but I came back two weeks early from Paris

449
00:18:22,474 --> 00:18:24,007
因为我感到寂寞
because I was lonely.

450
00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:25,058
我去了旧金山
I went to San Francisco,

451
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,212
却经历了我这辈子最糟糕的时光
and I was never more depressed in my life.

452
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:32,232
我是个小镇人 马修
I'm small town, Marshall.

453
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:34,618
我是从布鲁克林来的乡下人 
I'm a hick from Brooklyn who's terrified of living

454
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,855
连住在离我出生地地铁十站远的地方都害怕
more than ten subway stops from where I was born.

455
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:42,075
好了 莉莉 如果我能从明尼苏达州圣克劳德
Okay, Lily, if I can move from St. Cloud, Minnesota,

456
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,693
搬到纽约来
to New York City,

457
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:45,728
你也可以搬到罗马去
then you can move to Rome.

458
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,598
我们一点也不了解意大利
We know nothing about Italy.

459
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,649
在那边一个朋友也没有
We have no friends there.

460
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:51,000
也不会说意大利语
We don't speak the language.

461
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,491
　\N拜托 老兄 别独占所有洋葱圈

461
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:58,091
好吧 你会说一句
Okay, so you know that one sentence.

462
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,075

Can you say anything else?

463

That-that was the same sentence.

464
00:19:07,418 --> 00:19:09,752
只是变了变音调
You just changed the inflection.
