狗崽子! 他咬我!

6
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:15,000
安全起见 我还是去一趟急诊室吧
Okay, I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.

7
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,769
Howie 你想太多了
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

8
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:20,105
不 当我坐在了静音键上 却以为自己聋了的时候
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf,

9
00:00:20,107 --> 00:00:21,940
那才是我想太多
that was my hypochondria.

10
00:00:30,718 --> 00:00:34,219
我们换个时间再告诉他我怀孕了吧
We'll find another time to tell him I'm pregnant.

11
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:36,888
现在

如果你想引诱我去自己做早饭的话
If you're tricking me into making my own breakfast,

20
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,440
我妈早就用过这招了 你用这招也没用
it didn't work for my mom, and it won't work for you.

24
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:05,317
会是啥呢?
What could it be?

25
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,651
"我们是格鲁特"?
"We are Groot"?

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,651

00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:22,934
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

{\an8}(positive亦有 阳性 之意)

36
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:26,705
非常确定 
Pretty positive.

37
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,507
那是个玩笑 但是我的验孕棒显示...
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says...

38
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:30,041
天啊
Oh, my God.

39
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,379

我们要当父母了?
We're gonna be parents?

00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,860
是啊 太激动人心了
I know, it's crazy.

45
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,962
太激动人心了
It is crazy.

46
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:56,001
你怎么... 为宝宝的到来做好准备呢?
I mean, how do you... prepare for something like this?

47
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:59,204
我以前好像都没有抱过宝宝
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.

48
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:00,906
没事的 你会摸索出来的
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.

49
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,841
但是我们该怎么做?
But how's this all gonna work?

50
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:03,975
要请保姆吗?
Do we get a nanny?

51
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,210
我们请得起保姆吗?
I mean, can we afford a nanny?

52
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,012
假如请得起 不能请个漂亮的
And if we can, we can't get a pretty one,

53
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,980
因为她会毁掉我们的婚姻
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

54
00:02:10,384 --> 00:02:13,485
我们不能请丑的来 因为会把宝宝吓坏了的
We can't get an ugly one, 'cause it'll scare the kid.

55
00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:17,155
我也不知道 Howie
I-I don't know, Howie.

56
00:02:17,157 --> 00:02:18,623
咱们是住在好学区里吗?
Are we in a good school district?

57
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:19,858
你是天主教 我是犹太教
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish.

58
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,893
孩子应该信哪种教?
What religion do we raise it?

59
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:23,395
如果是男孩子 要不要给他割包皮?
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?

60
00:02:23,397 --> 00:02:24,596
人们都说这太野蛮了
People say it's barbaric,

61
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:27,499
但是不去割 看起来又像煎饼卷油条
but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.

62
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:33,071
淡定淡定 没事的
Calm down, it's gonna be okay.

63
00:02:33,073 --> 00:02:34,639
怎么会没事?
How's it gonna be okay?

64
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:38,076
看我呀 我自己都一团糟
Look at me, I'm a mess.

65
00:02:38,078 --> 00:02:39,744
那就说明 宝宝会是半团糟
And that means this baby's gonna half a mess.

66
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:41,012
而且现在我们还没吓坏那个
And that's even before we screw it up

67
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:43,815
物美价廉长相平庸的保姆 就已经糟透了

00:03:21,091 --> 00:03:22,624
为什么不是你发现的?
Why didn't you discover it?

83
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:25,260
因为为了做果酱 假期送你们
Because instead of being in the telescope room,

84
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:29,865
我没能去成望远镜室
I was busy making you guys homemade jam for the holidays.

我得和你们说些事情
I actually need to tell you guys something.

100
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:06,134
为啥"不要啊"?
Why "oh, no"?

101
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:08,103
因为这会改变一切
Because this changes everything.

102
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:09,471
漫画之夜怎么办?
What about comic book night?

我们去迪斯尼的计划呢?

带着孩子我们怎么做这些事啊?

00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,155
哦 是吗?
Oh, really?

111
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,425
好 一个孩子需要每隔11天就刮胡子吗?
Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?

112
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:35,030
一个成年人会拒绝吃
Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers

113
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,132
碎了一点的全麦饼干吗?
because one of them was broken?

114
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:39,000
我们扯平了
I guess we'll call this a draw.

115
00:04:41,772 --> 00:04:43,538
跟高兴你们能来这里
So, I'm glad you guys are here.

啥?
What?

120
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,380
"什么都不要说
"Don't say anything.

121
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,281
当她告诉你时假装吃惊就好"
Act surprised when she tells you."

122
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:55,183
好吧 你想怎么来?
All right, how you want to do this?

123
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,186
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

124
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,588
哦 天啊 简直不敢相信!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

125
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,856
太棒了!
This is so exciting!

126
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,525
嗯 我很激动
Yeah, I'm really exciting.

127
00:05:03,527 --> 00:05:06,595
你难道不开心吗?
Are you not happy about this?

128
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,831
我当... 当然开心
I am. Of-of course I am. I'm...

129
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,366
肯定是荷尔蒙的锅
I'm sure it's just the hormones.

130
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,503
但太奇怪了 是Howie这几年来
But it's weird. Howie's the one who's been talking about

131
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:15,937
一直都在说生个孩子
having kids for years, and I was

132
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,373
我以为他会很高兴 就激动地告诉了他
all excited to tell him because I thought he'd be thrilled,

133
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,142
但他却抓狂了
but then he started to flip out

134
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,010
弄得我觉得这是个坏主意
and now this feels like a bad idea

135
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:25,013
而且我要长胖了
and I'm gonna get fat.

136
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,748
不会的 别这样 你不会长胖的
No, no, come on. Come on, you're not gonna get fat.

137
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,417
你会变得美丽又迷人
You're gonna be beautiful and glowing

138
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:30,819
并拥有世界上最可爱的大肚皮
and-and have the cutest little baby bump ever.

139
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:33,088
站着说话不腰疼 瘦婊砸
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.

140
00:05:34,925 --> 00:05:36,892
不好意思 是荷尔蒙
Sorry, hormones.

141
00:05:36,894 --> 00:05:38,960
嗯 没事 我只听到了"瘦"
Oh, that's all right. All I heard was "skinny."

142
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:42,264
我认为Howard的反应跟你想的不一样
I wouldn't make too much out of Howard

143
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:43,995
也可以理解
not reacting the way you expected him to.

144
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,034
嗯 我敢肯定
Yeah, I'm sure

145
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,635
他只是被吓到了
it was just the initial shock of it all.

146
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:48,804
可能吧
You're probably right.

147
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,473
我们谈过之后他冷静下来了
After we talked about it, he started to calm down.

148
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:53,208
我根本不应该要孩子
I shouldn't be raising a kid.

149
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,410
我连我自己的蔬菜都不会吃
I don't even eat my own vegetables.

150
00:05:56,613 --> 00:05:58,847
哥们 我认为你有些夸张了
Buddy, I think you might be overreacting.

151
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:00,749
还有这鼻子
And then there's this nose.

152
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,819
他要是长得像我怎么办?
I mean, what if he looks like me?

153
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,288
或者更糟...
Or worse...

154
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,790
要是个女孩像我怎么办?
what if she looks like me?

155
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,292
更别提
Not to mention

156
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:12,294
这对我们朋友圈的影响了
the impact on our social circle.

157
00:06:12,296 --> 00:06:13,562
一切都会改变
Everything's going to change.

158
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:15,397
Howard不能像以前一样常来了
Howard won't be able to come over as much.

159
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,599
- 他可以带孩子过来啊  - 那我们还得
- Well, he could bring the baby here.  - Oh, but then we'd have to

160
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:20,368
给公寓装安全防护措施 跟你说 我姐姐
baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister

161
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:22,337
就给她家浴室马桶上锁了
has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom.

162
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:25,207
我有两个博士学位 可还是被逼得尿在洗脸池
I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink.

163
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:29,110
天啊 你知道
Oh, my God, and do you have any idea

164
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:32,247
养个孩子有多贵吗?
how expensive having a kid is?

165
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,683
我看到说在洛杉矶 供个孩子到大学
I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college

166
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,651
花费超过一百万
can cost over a million dollars.

167
00:06:36,653 --> 00:06:38,720
一百万?
A million dollars?

168
00:06:38,722 --> 00:06:42,424
天 这感觉就像我的蛋蛋在蛋疼
God, it's like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts.

169
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,860
行了... 我现在就得开始
That's it... I got to start

170
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,962
多挣钱了
earning more money right now.

171
00:06:46,964 --> 00:06:48,630
我有办法... 你可以让Bernadette
I know... you could ask Bernadette

172
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,032
多给你点零花钱
for a raise in your allowance.

173
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,801
这不是开玩笑
This isn't a joke.

174
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,636
我没有开玩笑
I wasn't joking.

175
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,939
不用担心
It'll be fine.

176
00:06:57,941 --> 00:06:59,407
每天都有人生孩子
People have kids every day.

177
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,775
- 你会想到办法的  - 是啊 
- You'll figure this out.  - Yeah, come on,

178
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:02,811
你也知道这是好事儿
this is great news and you know it.

179
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,713
嗯... 你说得对 是好消息
Oh... You're right, it is,

180
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,350
我只是... 有点不知所措
I'm just... a little overwhelmed right now.

181
00:07:08,352 --> 00:07:10,619
嘿 你知道我们该干嘛吗?
Hey, you know what we should do?

182
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:13,488
一起结扎以防悲剧重演?
All get vasectomies so this doesn't happen to us?

183
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:18,360
出去庆祝
Go out and celebrate.

184
00:07:19,296 --> 00:07:21,463
你还说过更难听的话
But not your worst idea.

185
00:07:23,634 --> 00:07:26,768
嘿 我们做点什么让你分散注意力吧
Hey, let's go do something to get your mind off this.

186
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,037
- 嗯嗯 我们该出去  - 去哪?
- Yeah, yeah, we should go out.  - Where?

187
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,338
不知道 酒吧?
Uh, I don't know, a bar?

188
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,873
不能喝酒
Can't drink.

189
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:34,576
我们能 不过算了
We can, but all right.

190
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,912
你饿了吗? 你爱的那家寿司店怎么样?
Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?

191
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,915
医生说我不能吃寿司
Doctor said I can't have sushi.

192
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,416
好吧 我们不一定非要出去
Okay, look, we don't have to go anywhere.

193
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,019
我们可以留在这儿泡热水澡
We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub.

194
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:46,354
医生说我不能泡热水澡
Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.

195
00:07:47,858 --> 00:07:49,658
或许你该换个新医生
Maybe you should get a new doctor.

196
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:55,263
怎么 他还禁止你笑吗?
What, he said you can't laugh either?

197
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:59,734
我建议为我们的朋友干一杯 Howard...
I'd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard...

198
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,604
敬他宽阔的胸怀 美丽的灵魂...
his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soul...

199
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:03,772
还有那竟然没剥夺他
And his tight little pants

200
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,074
生育能力的紧身小裤子
that somehow did not make him sterile.

201
00:08:06,076 --> 00:08:08,310
干杯
Cheers.

202
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:12,113
看这个
Well, look at this.

203
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,982
我敢说发明这小伞的人
I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas

204
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,817
肯定不愁钱的事
doesn't have to worry about money.

205
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,219
他想生多少孩子生多少
He can have all the kids he wants.

206
00:08:18,221 --> 00:08:21,556
还能给他们的脑袋遮一小片雨
And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.

207
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,261
我要是想好好养这个孩子
If I'm gonna have any chance of raising this kid,

208
00:08:26,263 --> 00:08:29,431
我得想出个挣钱的大招
I need to come up with a big idea to make some money.

209
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,266
- 这应该不难  - 你说得容易
- There's no reason you can't.  - That's easy for you to say.

210
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:32,901
你和Sheldon早就提出了
You and Sheldon already came up with

211
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,569
超流氦模型
your superfluid helium model.

212
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:35,971
那只是研究 我们从中
That's just research. We're never gonna

213
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,472
挣不了钱
make any money from it.

214
00:08:37,474 --> 00:08:39,174
管它氦不氦的 真正的超流体 
Forget helium. The real superfluid

215
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:41,943
是这杯子里的水果酒
is the fruit punch in this mug.

216
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,346
让我想起了老爸秘制的
Reminds me of my daddy's secret

217
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:46,581
"别告诉妈妈"果汁
"Don't Tell Mama" juice.

218
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,885
这酒劲儿还是挺大的 你慢点喝
Uh, these are strong, you should slow down.

219
00:08:59,432 --> 00:09:00,432
啊
Ah.

220
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,739
发明个这个怎么样...
Okay, how about this for an invention...

221
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:17,009
大... 一丁点的小伞
slightly... bigger cocktail umbrellas.

222
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:19,878
这怎么能算是发明?
How is that a new invention?

223
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,281
不知道 不过苹果公司不也就改改尺寸吗
I don't know, all Apple does is change the size of things

224
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,483
我们还是一直买
and we keep buying them.

225
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:28,287
是的说 我喜欢我的巨型iPad和小iPad
It's true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad

226
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,757
快赶上对普通大小iPad的喜欢了
almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.

227
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:33,992
这个地方好棒
This place is terrific.

228
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:36,595
为什么我们从没来过?
Why... why have we never been here before?

229
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:40,933
很多乐子我们都不去找... 因为你
The same reason we don't do a lot of fun stuff... you.

230
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,035
一个脸都聚不上焦的人
That's some smart talk from a guy

231
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,504
还能说出这么机智的话
who can't even keep his face in focus.

232
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,342
厕所在哪里?
Where's the bathroom?

233
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:51,510
那边角落
Uh, it's in the corner.

234
00:09:51,512 --> 00:09:53,712
失陪一下
Excuse me.

235
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,950
嘿 你们好吗?
Hey, how you doin'?

236
00:09:59,987 --> 00:10:01,887
希望厕所标志明显
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.

237
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:03,021
没关系
Doesn't matter.

238
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:05,324
反正他去了厨房
He's headed for the kitchen anyway.

239
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:07,359
这也许是个好主意...
Maybe that's an idea...

240
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,928
醉酒人士的导航系统
guidance systems for drunk people.

241
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,230
已经有了 叫优步
They have that. It's called Uber.

242
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:13,599
嘿
Hey.

243
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:15,334
在你们的过冷氦气实验中
In your supercooled helium experiments,

244
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:17,803
你们有制造出量子漩涡吗?
did you create quantum vortices?

245
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:18,804
有啊 怎么了?
Yeah. Why?

246
00:10:18,806 --> 00:10:20,105
如果你制造一个指引系统
Well, if you made a guidance system,

247
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,541
可不可以用这些漩涡作为陀螺仪?
couldn't you use those vortices as a gyroscope?

248
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:25,010
哇哦 我倒从来没这样想过
Wow. I've never thought about that.

249
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:26,612
而且既然处于量子态
And since it's in a quantum state,

250
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:28,413
就可以保持永久的持续性
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

251
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:31,049
开创性的启示 鸡尾酒
Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks.

252
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:35,087
这简直是欲望都市中最精彩的一集
Tell me this isn't like the best episode of Sex and the City.

253
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:39,858
你可能确实想出了一个好主意
You may have actually just come up with something.

254
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,560
- 你真这么觉得?  - 当然
- You think so?  - I really do.

255
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:44,563
小伙伴们 这里的厕所简直棒极了
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.

256
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:47,199
有人在里面做饭
There's people cooking in it.

257
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,436
想想当你有了孩子之后
Think about all the fun things you get to do

258
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:52,804
所有可以做的好玩的事 
when you have a baby. Yeah!

259
00:10:52,806 --> 00:10:56,041
你可以去买玩具和小衣服
Yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes.

260
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:59,044
这些事我现在就在给Howie做了
I kind of already do that for Howie.

261
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:00,946
还有 不管你什么时候觉得饿了
And-and whenever you're hungry,

262
00:11:00,948 --> 00:11:05,050
会发现地上到处都面包车和麦片
you'll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor.

263
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,919
我给Sheldon找了一个新的旅行杯
Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon.

264
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:10,055
每次只能三口三口喝
It only lets out three at a time.

265
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,859
你们是什么时候决定造人的?
So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?

266
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,628
呃 我们并没有做任何决定
Well, we didn't exactly decide.

267
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,896
一直有说到这事
We were talking about it,

268
00:11:17,898 --> 00:11:20,132
然后一个晚上我们就有点鲁莽
and then one night we got a little reckless.

269
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,134
- 说说看!  - 赶紧的!
- Oh, tell us!  - Yeah, tell us.

270
00:11:22,136 --> 00:11:23,368
- 不要啦 我很不好意思的  - 快点说
- No, I'm embarrassed.  - Oh, come on,

271
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,137
大家都是成年人 都做过的
we're all grown-ups. We've all done it.

272
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,173
我! 我也是！我是一个成年人而且我做过了!
Me! Me-me, too! I'm a grown-up and I've done it!

273
00:11:30,577 --> 00:11:32,577
好吧
Fine.

274
00:11:32,579 --> 00:11:34,112
一天晚上我们外出
We were out one night,

275
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:37,683
然后事情就自然的发生了
and things got a little spontaneous.

276
00:11:37,685 --> 00:11:39,618
感觉有八卦
Oh, that sounds juicy.

277
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,553
Sheldon一直在不同地说时区
Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones

278
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:44,409
铁路时间表什么的 我出去..
and railroad schedules, and I went out...

279
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,793
停 我想起来了 等下
Wait, I remember that. Hang on.

280
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:50,429
你们在我们那里做的?
You did it at our place?

281
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:53,632
貌似是在Sheldon床上
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

282
00:11:53,634 --> 00:11:56,234
什么?! 
What?! No!

283
00:11:57,071 --> 00:11:59,037
我当时要去厕所
I was headed to the bathroom,

284
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,373
刚好碰到Howie出来
and I passed Howie on his way out.

285
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,243
通常他会说 "不要进去那里"
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"

286
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:10,182
但这次他说 "嘿 我们到这里面去"
but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."

287
00:12:10,184 --> 00:12:11,717
- 你们怎么可以这样?  - 对不起
- How could you do that?  - I'm sorry,

288
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:13,952
但你知道的 和你男人在一起时会怎样
but you know what it's like when you're with your man

289
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:15,620
然后事情就这样发生了
and one thing leads to another.

290
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:18,190
我确实知道是怎么样的 真的
I do know what that's like. I really do.

291
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:22,394
我没看到有人
I'm not seeing anyone

292
00:12:22,396 --> 00:12:24,496
这样利用液氦漩涡
using liquid helium vortices like this.

293
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,364
我也没找到
I'm not finding anything either.

294
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:27,599
这是个好迹象
That's a good sign.

295
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:29,534
等等 我发现一些
Oh, wait, I found something.

296
00:12:29,536 --> 00:12:30,902
讨厌 发现什么了
Damn. What is it?

297
00:12:30,904 --> 00:12:33,772
一段视频 熊猫宝宝打喷嚏
This video. The baby panda sneezes,

298
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:36,742
把熊猫妈妈吓坏了
and the mama panda gets so scared.

299
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,980
能不能集中注意到我们正在说的事情上来?
Can you focus on what we're talking about?

300
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:43,415
好吧
All right.

301
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:45,951
听着 这可能是酒后胡话
Look, now, this may be the rum talking,

302
00:12:45,953 --> 00:12:48,887
只要漩涡的比率
but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices

303
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:51,356
保持在1.1到1.3之间
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

304
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:54,726
马努格斯力的效应就是微不足道的
the Magnus force issue should be negligible.

305
00:12:56,196 --> 00:12:59,965
就算喝醉了 他也比我们都要灵光些
Even drunk, he's still smarter than all of us.

306
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:01,900
而且强壮一些
And stronger.

307
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:05,370
谁想看我揍翻那个酒保?
Yeah. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?

308
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:08,006
我很愿意看
I'd enjoy that.

309
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,475
算了 她是个好孩子
Nah, she's a good kid.

310
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:15,013
如果这个是可行的 我们就能申请专利
If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent

311
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:18,083
然后授权给制造导航系统的公司
and license it to companies that make guidance systems.

312
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:20,552
看啊 你才知晓自己成为父亲不过一天 
Look at that. You've known you're gonna be a father

313
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:23,221
就已经开始进步了
for less than a day and you're already stepping up.

314
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,456
跟你讲 你肯定能搞定
I'm telling you, you got this.

315
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,724
也许你是对的
Maybe you're right.

316
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:27,192
他当然是对的
Of course he's right.

317
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:30,962
你和我都知道长大时没有父亲有多艰难
You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father.

318
00:13:30,964 --> 00:13:32,864
所以我确信你会
That's why I'm confident you're gonna be

319
00:13:32,866 --> 00:13:34,599
成为最棒的父亲
the best dad you can be.

320
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:37,502
谢谢你 Sheldon
Thank you, Sheldon.

321
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:38,804
不用谢
You're welcome.

322
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,405
而且如果他生的是双胞胎 我们就能
And if he has twins, we can do

323
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:43,875
拿他们做各种有趣的实验
all kinds of neat experiments on them.

324
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,214
如果愿意的话你们可以进去
You guys can go in if you want.

325
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:50,515
算了 我们是一起的
No, we're a team.

326
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:52,484
如果你不能进去 我们也不进去
If you can't go in, we're not going in.

327
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,620
那为什么我们还要喝酒?
Then why are we drinking?

328
00:13:55,622 --> 00:13:58,356
够了 她怀上的又不是圣婴 别那么认真
Okay, it's not like she's got the Christ child in there,

329
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,292
好吗?
all right?

330
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,261
是Leonard
Oh. It's Leonard.

331
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,564
他说Sheldon喝醉了 他们打算去K歌
He says Sheldon's drunk and they're gonna do karaoke

332
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:06,698
问我们要不要也一起去
if we want to join them.

333
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,633
好像蛮好玩
That sounds fun.

334
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:10,535
不好
Oh, no.

335
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:12,470
Sheldon喝醉了还给我发短信
Sheldon's drunk texting me.

336
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,505
说了什么?
What's it say?

337
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:16,241
你们要不要和我们一起去K歌
"Would you like to sing karaoke with us."

338
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,676
这哪里像醉了?
How is that a drunk text?

339
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:19,578
他结尾用的句号而不是问号
He used a period instead of a question mark.

340
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,047
简直醉成狗了
He's so wasted.

341
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:26,518
# 电影就要开始 你在路上等着巴士 #
# Your movie's showing, so you're going #

342
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,386
# 就算看过烂片五场 你也不觉慌张 #
# Could care less about the five you're blowing #

343
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:30,455
# 剧场开始变黑 剧幕就要拉开 #
# Theater gets dark just to start the show #

344
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,857
# 你瞅见有个美眉 #
# You spot a fine woman sitting #

345
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:33,458
# 坐在你同一边 穿着黄色裙边 #
# In your row, she's dressed in yellow #

346
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,693
# 她说 嘿 #
# She says, "Hello" #

347
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,728
# 旁边那个小哥 靠我再近一些 #
# "Come sit next to me, you fine fellow" #

348
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,463
# 没有半分犹豫 你流着哈喇子上前 #
# You run over there without a second to lose #

349
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:39,998
# 下面还有什么 嘿 #
# And what comes next, hey #

350
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,333
# 动一动 #
# Bust a move #

351
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:43,368
# 你渴求 #
# You want it #

352
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,171
# 你激动 噢 你渴求 #
# You got it, oh, you want it #

353
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:48,139
# 宝贝 你激动 #
# Baby, you got it #

354
00:14:48,141 --> 00:14:49,174
# 动一动啊 #
# Just bust a move #

355
00:14:49,176 --> 00:14:50,976
# 你渴求 #
# You want it #

356
00:14:50,978 --> 00:14:53,545
# 你激动 噢 #
# You got it, oh #

357
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:56,114
# 你渴求 贝贝 你激动 #
# You want it, baby, you got it #

358
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:58,283
# 动一动啊 #
# Just bust a move #

359
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,619
# 你渴求 你激动 #
# You want it, you got it #

360
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:02,487
# 你渴求 #
# Oh, you want it #

361
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:05,323
大家伙 祝贺你们!
Hey, guys. Congratulations!

362
00:15:05,325 --> 00:15:06,291
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:15:06,293 --> 00:15:08,960
你们玩的怎么样?
Hi. How are you doing?

364
00:15:08,962 --> 00:15:10,562
太有意思了
Oh, wonderful.

365
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:13,932
我正随着音乐动一动
I'm being musically encouraged to bust a move.

366
00:15:13,934 --> 00:15:17,602
如果我知道那是什么意思 我就照着做了
If I knew what that meant, I might just do it.

367
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:19,271
我很高兴你来了
I'm really glad you're here.

368
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:21,373
- 我们能聊聊吗?  - 当然
- Can we talk?  - Sure.

369
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,609
你过会儿也要上去表演吗?
So, you gonna get up there later?

370
00:15:24,611 --> 00:15:26,444
一只麦 一个挂满
A microphone, a room

371
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,747
伪波利尼西亚宗教饰物的房间
full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion,

372
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:33,084
还有一帮忠实听众 哥怎么能不上呢?
and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am.

373
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:37,222
我很抱歉自己今早这么失态
I'm sorry I freaked out this morning.

374
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:38,657
我希望你知道...
I want you to know...

375
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,825
我不会再害怕了
I'm done being scared.

376
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:43,628
觉得不安没什么的 我也很慌
It's okay to be nervous. I am, too.

377
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
谢天谢地 因为我说谎了 你想看别人尿裤子
Thank God, 'cause I was lying-- you might not have to wait

378
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:48,500
恐怕不用等到九个月以后了
nine months to see someone soil their pants.

379
00:15:48,502 --> 00:15:52,504
但我也很兴奋
But I'm also really excited.

380
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:54,706
真心的
I mean it.

381
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,007
我也是
Me, too.

382
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:57,609
我爱你
I love you.

383
00:15:58,645 --> 00:16:00,345
我不只是因为你胸部会变大
Mmm. And I'm not just saying that

384
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,580
才这么说的哦
because your breasts are gonna get bigger.

385
00:16:06,086 --> 00:16:09,521
# 我们是一对吧? 女孩别再折磨我了 #
# Are we an item? Girl, quit playin' #

386
00:16:09,523 --> 00:16:10,956
# 我们只是朋友 #
# We're just friends #

387
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,025
# 你在说什么? #
# What are you sayin'? #

388
00:16:14,027 --> 00:16:17,295
# 看着我的眼睛告诉我你心里有了别人 #
# Say there's another and look right in my eyes #

389
00:16:17,297 --> 00:16:20,298
# 我的初恋就这样第一次伤了我的心 #
# My first love broke my heart for the first time #

390
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,766
# 而我就像 #
# And I was like #

391
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:24,569
# 宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 噢 #
# Baby, baby, baby, ooh #

392
00:16:24,571 --> 00:16:28,506
# 就像 宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 不 #
# Like, baby, baby, baby, no #

393
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:31,843
# 就像 宝贝 宝贝 宝贝 噢 #
# Like, baby, baby, baby, ooh #

394
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:36,348
# 我曾以为你永远属于我 #
# I thought you'd always be mine #

395
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,319
# 宝贝 我需要你的爱 #

396
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:44,422
# 必须完全享有你的爱 #

00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:58,269
# 宝贝 宝贝 #

401
00:16:58,271 --> 00:16:59,604
# 噢 宝贝 宝贝 #

402
00:16:59,606 --> 00:17:02,107
# 宝贝 宝贝 #

403
00:17:02,109 --> 00:17:03,241
# 啊 加把劲吧 #

404
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:04,542
我很感激 但你们真的不需要...
I appreciate this, but you really...

405
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:07,579
# 努努力再加把劲吧 #
# Push it real good #

406
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:12,317
# 就在我爸爸死去的地方 #
# Land where my fathers died #

407
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,855
# 是朝圣者骄傲的家乡 #
# Land of the pilgrims' pride #

408
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:22,027
# 从每一个山坡上 #
# From ev'ry mountainside #

409
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,264
# 就让自由 #
# Let freedom #

410
00:17:26,266 --> 00:17:31,403
# 唱响... #
# Ring... #

411
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:34,139
我想把今晚的
I'd like to dedicate

412
00:17:34,141 --> 00:17:37,842
最后一首歌送给我的妻子
my last song of the evening to my wife,

413
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:39,778
我的挚友 也是...
best friend, and...

414
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,213
我孩子的母亲
now the mother of our child.

415
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:44,816
我爱你 Bernie
I love you, Bernie.

416
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:50,555
# 孕育着我的孩子 #
# Havin' my baby #

417
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:53,024
# 是多么有爱的方式 #
# What a lovely way of sayin' #

418
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:56,561
# 说着你爱我 #
# How much you love me #

419
00:17:56,563 --> 00:17:59,864
# 孕育着我的孩子 #
# Havin' my baby #

420
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:01,900
# 是多么有爱的方式 #
# What a lovely way #

421
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:05,136
# 说着你心里有我 #
# Of sayin' what you're thinkin' of me #

422
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:06,638
你逗我呢!
You're kidding!

423
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,809
什么奇葩会在别人的卧室里滚床单啊?
What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone else's bedroom?!

424
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:16,214
感谢你 帕萨迪纳! 晚安!
Thank you, Pasadena! Good night!

425
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,597
这个晚上太有意思了
That was such a fun night.

426
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:29,299
大概是因为你看见你家男人
Probably 'cause you got to see your man

427
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:32,402
在台上嗨翻全场吧
up there rockin' the mic.

428
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:34,037
是啊 你决定秀B-Box的时候
Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised

429
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,005
我还真是有点小惊讶呢
when you decided to beat-box.

430
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,875
额 那其实是我哮喘发作了
Oh. That was really an asthma attack.

431
00:18:38,877 --> 00:18:41,344
我就即兴发挥了
I just sold it.

432
00:18:42,347 --> 00:18:44,314
我真为Howard和Bernadette感到高兴
Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette.

433
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,848
我也是
Me, too.

434
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,085
这么说你也考虑过咯?
So, you ever think about it?

435
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,453
生孩子?
Babies? Mm-hmm.

436
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,256
这个嘛 现在还不急 不过总有一天是要生的
Well, I'm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure.

437
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,791
你呢?
What about you?

438
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,961
我想我们会成为很棒的父母
I think we'd make amazing parents.

439
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,030
你俩能安静点不?
Will you guys keep it down?

440
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,671
不过说起来 我们还不够成熟啊
On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity.
