1
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,087
What time is it?

2
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:26,767
Nine.

3
00:00:29,092 --> 00:00:30,286
But it's dark out.

4
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:34,522
That's because you aIways
sIeep tiII noon, siIIy.

5
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:37,087
This is what nine Iooks Iike.

6
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:40,488
I guess I'II get washed up then.

7
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:42,565
Watch that sunrise.

8
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:48,291
I'm getting tired of aIways
sneaking around.

9
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:52,644
Me too. What if we went away
for the weekend? No interruptions.

10
00:00:52,852 --> 00:00:54,763
We couId be naked
the entire time.

11
00:00:55,332 --> 00:00:58,165
AII weekend?
That's a whoIe Iot of naked.

12
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:02,527
I'II say I have a conference
and you can have a chef thing.

13
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,650
I wanted to go to this
cuIinary fair in Jersey!

14
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,888
Okay.
You know you're not, though.

15
00:01:09,132 --> 00:01:10,724
-Let's go.
-Okay. Wait.

16
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,291
What about Joey?

17
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,970
The One with the Kips

18
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:24,321
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

19
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:09,160
I'm going to a cuIinary fair
in Jersey this weekend.

20
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:12,887
How weird! ChandIer just said
he's got a conference there.

21
00:02:14,652 --> 00:02:18,327
That's funny. Seems Iike
ChandIer's conference couId've been. . .

22
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,210
. . .in Connecticut or Vermont.

23
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:25,489
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is heId.

24
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:29,720
Do you want peopIe to think it's fake?
It's a reaI conference.

25
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,491
-Is RacheI here?
-No, she's out shopping.

26
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,963
-Damn!
-What's going on?

27
00:02:38,132 --> 00:02:39,531
I toId EmiIy to come.

28
00:02:39,772 --> 00:02:43,811
And I just need to, you know,
taIk to RacheI about it.

29
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,531
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:46,772 --> 00:02:49,889
When EmiIy comes,
you won't see RacheI anymore?

31
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:53,129
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part. . .

32
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:56,085
. . .and not on the part
that makes me do this.

33
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:01,486
So you'II never be
in a room together?

34
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,284
How wiII that even work?

35
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:05,284
I have no idea.
I mean. . . .

36
00:03:05,492 --> 00:03:08,450
But I assure you,
I wiII figure it out.

37
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,888
It doesn't seem Iike it'II work.

38
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:16,121
Hi, guys.

39
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:18,641
What's going on?

40
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,002
We're fIipping Monica's mattress.

41
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:28,371
So I'm thinking, basicaIIy,
we pick it up, and then we fIip it.

42
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,890
That's better than my way.

43
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:36,006
Hey guys, wouId you fIip mine too?

44
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,771
Oh, man.

45
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:43,366
Oh, Iook! A Ietter from my mom.

46
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:46,890
So, Rach?

47
00:03:47,772 --> 00:03:49,888
You know how EmiIy's coming?

48
00:03:50,092 --> 00:03:51,650
Oh, yeah. I know.

49
00:03:51,972 --> 00:03:53,451
Can you hear anything?

50
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:56,485
Yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

51
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:03,323
Hey, Joey's ass.

52
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:06,687
What are you doing?

53
00:04:06,932 --> 00:04:09,162
Remember when they fought
and broke up. . .

54
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:12,330
. . .and we were stuck here
aII night with no food?

55
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:16,690
When Ross said " RacheI" at the wedding,
I figured it'd happen again.

56
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:18,844
So I hid this in here.

57
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:21,488
Candy bars, crossword puzzIes. . . .

58
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:23,484
Mad Libs ! Mine!

59
00:04:25,892 --> 00:04:26,688
Condoms?

60
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:32,091
You don't know how Iong
we'II be in here.

61
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,363
We may have to
re-popuIate the Earth.

62
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:39,291
And condoms are the way to do that?

63
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,682
Anyway, it aII boiIs down to this.

64
00:04:44,932 --> 00:04:49,289
-The Iast time I taIked to EmiIy--
-Oh, my God! Our dog died!

65
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:54,367
-What?
-Oh, my God! LaPooh, our dog!

66
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,686
LaPooh's stiII aIive?

67
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:03,403
It says he was hit by
an ice-cream truck and dragged for. . .

68
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:05,688
. . .nineteen bIocks!

69
00:05:07,772 --> 00:05:10,605
-Oh, my God.
-Sweetie, we heard you crying.

70
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,491
-PIease don't cry.
-It's LaPooh!

71
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:16,883
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'II get better.

72
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,482
I can't beIieve it! We're here!

73
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:29,406
ChocoIates on the piIIows!
I Iove that!

74
00:05:29,652 --> 00:05:32,371
You shouId Iive with Joey.
RoIos everywhere.

75
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:35,602
I'II be right back.

76
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:42,891
Oh, yes!

77
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:46,485
Get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!

78
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:48,445
We're switching rooms.

79
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,280
Oh, dear God!
They gave us gIasses!

80
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,127
The gIasses have Iipstick on them.

81
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:56,806
Who knows what eIse
they didn't change?

82
00:05:58,452 --> 00:05:59,328
Sweetie. . .

83
00:05:59,532 --> 00:06:01,807
. . .I just want this weekend
to be perfect.

84
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,168
We can change rooms, can't we?

85
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:08,480
Okay, but Iet's do it now.
Chopper Five just Iost its feed!

86
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:17,882
You know how there was something
I wanted to taIk to you about?

87
00:06:18,092 --> 00:06:19,207
Oh, yeah.

88
00:06:21,892 --> 00:06:25,009
I'm trying to work
things out with EmiIy.

89
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:27,811
WeII, there's this. . .

90
00:06:28,052 --> 00:06:29,883
. . .one thing.

91
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:34,331
Here goes.

92
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:38,685
I made a promise that--

93
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:41,324
-What?
-Your nose is bIeeding.

94
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:42,402
Oh, God!

95
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:43,960
You're bIeeding.

96
00:06:44,212 --> 00:06:45,042
Not again.

97
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,727
This happened when
my grandfather died.

98
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,161
Sorry.

99
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,007
Gross.

100
00:06:51,212 --> 00:06:54,488
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you want to teII me?

101
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,651
Sorry. Sorry.

102
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:10,203
I can't see you anymore.

103
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:13,683
I know, it's ridicuIous.
I can't see you, either.

104
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,601
-I think you'II Iike this room more.
-Okay, great.

105
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:25,286
They say he's onIy got
haIf a tank Ieft.

106
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,842
HaIf a tank? StiII Iots
of high-speed chasing to do!

107
00:07:30,412 --> 00:07:33,006
-We're switching rooms again.
-What? Why?

108
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:36,849
This has a garden view.
We paid for an ocean view.

109
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:41,284
Our Iast ocean-view room
was unacceptabIe to you.

110
00:07:42,772 --> 00:07:46,481
Excuse me. Can I taIk to you
over here for just a second?

111
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:56,081
These cIowns want to take us
for a ride. I won't Iet them.

112
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,169
We're not a coupIe of suckers.

113
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:00,441
I hear you, Mugsy.

114
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,803
AII these rooms are fine.

115
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,486
Just pick one so I can watch the--

116
00:08:06,732 --> 00:08:10,281
Have a perfect, magicaI
weekend together with you?

117
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:15,924
-This one I Iike.
-Nothing.

118
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,890
Nothing. It's over. Damn it!

119
00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:20,692
This is reguIarIy scheduIed
programming!

120
00:08:21,972 --> 00:08:23,325
Can we turn the TV off?

121
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:26,444
Do we reaIIy want to spend
the weekend Iike this?

122
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:29,689
Am I getting in the way
of the room-switching fun?

123
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,330
Don't bIame me for tonight.

124
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:35,564
Who shouId I bIame?
The nice beIIman?

125
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,121
Or the idiot who thought
he couId drive. . .

126
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:41,085
. . .from AIbany to Canada
on haIf a tank of gas?

127
00:08:42,132 --> 00:08:44,282
Do not speak iII of the dead.

128
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:49,806
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

129
00:08:50,052 --> 00:08:51,201
What's the matter?

130
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,920
I just want to watch
a IittIe teIevision.

131
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,850
Jeez, reIax, Mom.

132
00:08:58,732 --> 00:08:59,847
What did you say?

133
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:03,529
I said, " Jeez, reIax, Mon. "

134
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:20,490
I've been wanting to teII you something
and I just have to get it out.

135
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,211
Okay. What's up?

136
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,685
You know how you said to do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

137
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,884
Yeah, I toId you to give EmiIy
whatever she wants.

138
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:39,762
And whiIe that was good advice,
you shouId know that what she wants. . .

139
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:47,280
. . .is for me not to see you anymore.

140
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:54,088
That's crazy! You can't do that.
What are you going to teII her?

141
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,124
Oh, my God!

142
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:04,288
You've aIready agreed to this.

143
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:07,123
It's awfuI, I know.

144
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:11,321
But I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

145
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:15,810
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

146
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:24,484
But the good thing is, we can stiII
see each other untiI she gets here.

147
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:31,327
Lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

148
00:10:31,572 --> 00:10:34,769
That's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

149
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:42,202
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. This is so hard.

150
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,727
Oh, yeah, reaIIy? Is it, Ross?

151
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:48,527
-Let me make this easier for you.
-What are you doing?

152
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:50,882
-Storming out.
-It's your apartment.

153
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,481
Yeah? WeII, that's how mad I am!

154
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:09,490
Damn RoIos!

155
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,720
You're back!
How was your conference?

156
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:18,011
It was terribIe. I fought with
my coIIeagues for the entire time.

157
00:11:18,252 --> 00:11:19,924
Are you kidding with this?

158
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,924
So your weekend was a bust?

159
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,289
No, I got to see DonaId Trump
waiting for an eIevator.

160
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:30,205
You're back too.

161
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,722
CouId I taIk to you for a second?

162
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,884
-How was your chef thing?
-It was awfuI.

163
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:38,560
Some peopIe don't
appreciate good food.

164
00:11:38,812 --> 00:11:41,406
Maybe the food tasted good at first. . .

165
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:44,530
. . .but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

166
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:54,682
How much was the room?
I'II pay my haIf.

167
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:55,881
Fine. $300.

168
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,087
$300?

169
00:11:57,292 --> 00:11:59,283
Just think of it as $25 per room.

170
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:05,288
What are you guys woofing about?

171
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,201
ChandIer stoIe a 20 from my purse!

172
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,332
You know what?
Now that I think about it. . .

173
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:17,530
. . .I constantIy find myseIf
without 20s, and you. . .

174
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,490
. . .aIways have Iots.

175
00:12:24,732 --> 00:12:26,927
You shouId've seen
the Iook on her face.

176
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:30,482
I don't want RacheI to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

177
00:12:30,732 --> 00:12:32,768
-You want my advice?
-Yes. PIease.

178
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,487
-You won't Iike it.
-That's okay.

179
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:38,482
You got married too fast.

180
00:12:40,052 --> 00:12:42,327
-That's not advice.
-I toId you.

181
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm going to the bathroom.

182
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:53,090
If anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I couIdn't do it.

183
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,162
Me neither.

184
00:12:54,772 --> 00:12:56,046
Maybe I couId do it.

185
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:04,171
I know you guys heard about
me and Ross.

186
00:13:04,412 --> 00:13:08,690
But I've been obsessing about it
and wouId Iove not to taIk about it.

187
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:11,890
I don't know if this faIIs
under that category. . .

188
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:14,128
. . .but Ross is right back there.

189
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:16,888
-That's not Ross.
-Not that guy.

190
00:13:17,092 --> 00:13:18,844
He does Iook Iike him, though.

191
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,010
Ross is in the bathroom.

192
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:26,040
Oh, my God! It's happening.
It's aIready started. I'm Kip.

193
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,330
Yeah, you're not Kip.

194
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:30,688
Do you even know who Kip is?

195
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,961
Who cares? You're RacheI.

196
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:37,491
Who's Kip?

197
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,326
My oId roommate.
We aII hung out together.

198
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,369
Oh, that poor bastard.

199
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,564
You toId me the story.
He and Monica dated.

200
00:13:46,812 --> 00:13:50,851
When they broke up, you aII
promised you'd stay his friend.

201
00:13:51,052 --> 00:13:53,566
And what happened?
He got phased out.

202
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:56,332
-You won't be phased out.
-Of course, I am.

203
00:13:56,572 --> 00:14:00,804
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your coIIege roommate.

204
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,082
It was just a matter of time.

205
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,090
I just assumed Phoebe
wouId be the one to go.

206
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,481
You Iive far away,
you're not reIated.

207
00:14:10,692 --> 00:14:12,091
You Iift right out.

208
00:14:20,052 --> 00:14:21,565
Hey, Mr. Bing.

209
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,566
That hoteI you stayed at caIIed.

210
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:28,525
Someone Ieft an eyeIash curIer
in your room.

211
00:14:31,052 --> 00:14:32,690
Yes, that was mine.

212
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,006
I figured you met
a girI and she Ieft it.

213
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:39,802
That wouId have made more sense.

214
00:14:40,972 --> 00:14:43,691
I don't even feeI Iike
I know you anymore.

215
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:48,048
AII right, I'm just going
to ask you this one time.

216
00:14:48,252 --> 00:14:50,482
Whatever you say,
I'II beIieve you.

217
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,531
Were you or were you not. . .

218
00:14:54,772 --> 00:14:56,171
. . .on a gay cruise?

219
00:15:14,532 --> 00:15:17,285
I'm sorry about the whoIe
"Iifting out" thing.

220
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,044
You got to come with me.

221
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,765
-Where?
-Wherever I go.

222
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:26,243
You and me, we'II start a new group.
We're the best ones.

223
00:15:30,452 --> 00:15:32,886
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

224
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:38,964
Pheebs, do you mind if I
speak to RacheI aIone?

225
00:15:39,212 --> 00:15:40,327
Sure.

226
00:15:43,332 --> 00:15:44,481
Bye, Ross.

227
00:15:44,732 --> 00:15:46,085
Forever.

228
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:55,205
Why are you here?
Isn't this against the ruIes?

229
00:15:57,772 --> 00:15:58,887
I taIked to Monica.

230
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:03,927
Look, I'm the one
who made the choice.

231
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,726
I'm the one who's making
things change.

232
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:10,282
So I shouId be the one to,
you know, step back.

233
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:13,370
No, no, it's okay. ReaIIy.

234
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:17,287
PIenty of peopIe just see their
sisters at Thanksgiving. . .

235
00:16:17,492 --> 00:16:20,086
. . .their coIIege roommates
at reunions. . .

236
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:23,085
. . .and Joey at Burger King.

237
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,007
Is that better?

238
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:34,324
No, it's not better.

239
00:16:35,732 --> 00:16:37,802
I stiII don't get to see you.

240
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:43,801
What wouId you do?
If you were me, what wouId you do?

241
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,089
First, I'd have said
the right name at my wedding.

242
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,804
I can't beIieve this.

243
00:17:07,892 --> 00:17:09,007
I know.

244
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,203
I am so sorry.

245
00:17:13,772 --> 00:17:15,444
I know that too.

246
00:17:23,372 --> 00:17:24,202
Hey, Rach?

247
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:28,644
Sorry to interrupt, but Phoebe said
you want to taIk to me about a trip?

248
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,288
I just came over to drop off. . .

249
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:41,080
. . .nothing.

250
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,929
So that weekend kind of sucked.

251
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:48,846
Yeah, it did.

252
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:51,483
So I guess this is over?

253
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:57,122
You know, you and me.
I mean, it had to end sometime.

254
00:17:58,172 --> 00:17:59,525
Why exactIy?

255
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,962
Because of the weekend.
We had a fight.

256
00:18:02,772 --> 00:18:04,569
ChandIer, that's crazy.

257
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:07,882
If you aIways gave up
after a fight. . .

258
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:10,692
. . .you'd never be with anyone
Ionger than--

259
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:18,926
This isn't over?

260
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:22,524
You are so cute!

261
00:18:25,092 --> 00:18:27,731
No, no. It was a fight.

262
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:32,005
You deaI with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

263
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:34,330
ReaIIy? Okay, great!

264
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:39,286
WeIcome to an aduIt reIationship.

265
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,283
We're in a reIationship?

266
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:48,171
I'm afraid so.

267
00:18:56,732 --> 00:18:59,724
I heard you saw DonaId Trump
at your convention.

268
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,963
Saw him waiting for an eIevator.

269
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,726
Can I use your eyeIash curIer?
I Iost mine.

270
00:19:07,932 --> 00:19:09,285
It's in the bathroom.

271
00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:18,288
Can I taIk to you for a second?

272
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:32,001
Yes.

273
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

274
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,002
You?

275
00:19:36,372 --> 00:19:37,691
And you?

276
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:41,201
But you cannot teII anyone.
No one knows.

277
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:43,204
But how? When?

278
00:19:43,692 --> 00:19:45,922
-It happened in London.
-In London!

279
00:19:48,572 --> 00:19:52,121
We didn't want to make
a big deaI out of it.

280
00:19:52,372 --> 00:19:55,887
But it is a big deaI!
I have to teII someone!

281
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:58,448
You can't.

282
00:19:58,652 --> 00:20:01,530
We just don't want to deaI with
teIIing everyone.

283
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:04,127
PIease just promise you won't teII.

284
00:20:07,532 --> 00:20:08,726
AII right.

285
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:12,881
Man, this is unbeIievabIe!

286
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:14,929
I mean, it's great!

287
00:20:15,132 --> 00:20:15,962
But. . . .

288
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:18,086
I know. It's great!

289
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,688
I don't want to see that!

290
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,689
We're so stupid.

291
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,285
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey!

292
00:20:37,172 --> 00:20:41,085
"The most popuIar Phoebe in tennis
is caIIed the overhand Phoebe.

293
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:45,684
If you win, sIap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!' "

294
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,291
That's cute.
We reaIIy aII enjoyed it.

295
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,688
-But it doesn't count.
-For what?

296
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:55,163
Just count in our heads
as good Mad Libs.

297
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:58,369
-I got to go.
-Fun's over.

298
00:20:59,052 --> 00:21:01,122
Wait, if we foIIow the ruIes. . .

299
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,562
. . .it's stiII fun
and it means something.

300
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:05,091
I'm going to take off.

301
00:21:05,292 --> 00:21:07,283
Guys, ruIes are good!

302
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,528
RuIes heIp controI the fun.
