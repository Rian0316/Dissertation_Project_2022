1
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,795
The main news this Thursday pm
is the big government re-shuffle.

2
00:00:44,968 --> 00:00:47,959
I have with me, to discuss his new empire,

3
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,518
the Minister for Administrative Affairs,
the Right Honourable James Hacker.

4
00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:57,637
It's been said that you are now Mr
Town Hall as well as Mr Whitehall.

5
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,118
Well, it's very flattering
of you to put it that way.

6
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:05,281
It wasn't me who put it that
way, it was the Daily Mirror.

7
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:10,600
I just wanted to confirm that you are
now this country's chief bureaucrat.

8
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:14,920
That's nonsense. This government
believes in reducing bureaucracy.

9
00:01:15,088 --> 00:01:20,082
Figures I have here say that your
department's staff has risen by 10%.

10
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:22,477
- Certainly not.
- What figure do you have?

11
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,927
I believe the figure
is much more like 9.97.

12
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:31,560
Well, it has been suggested that
your department is less interested

13
00:01:31,727 --> 00:01:34,400
in reducing bureaucracy
than in increasing it.

14
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:41,168
Well, yes, but that's because we've had to
take on more staff in order to reduce staff.

15
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,277
- I beg your pardon?
- It's common sense.

16
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,442
We need more doctors to cure more patients,
more firemen to extinguish more fires.

17
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:52,566
How will you extinguish
local government bureaucracy?

18
00:01:52,727 --> 00:01:54,957
It's a challenge I'm looking forward to.

19
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:59,519
Would you agree there's even more
bureaucratic waste there than in Whitehall?

20
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:04,079
- Yes, that's what makes it a challenge.
- How will you meet the challenge?

21
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:09,367
It's far too early to give detailed proposals.
I've just come here direct from Number 10.

22
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,520
From number 9.97, perhaps!

23
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:20,198
The broad strategy is to cut ruthlessly at
waste while leaving essential services intact.

24
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:23,917
That's what your predecessor
said. Did he fail?

25
00:02:24,087 --> 00:02:30,162
Let me finish. Because we must be absolutely
clear and I'm going to be quite frank with you.

26
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:36,717
The fact is that, at the end of
the day, it is the right, the duty,

27
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,879
of the elected government
in the House of Commons

28
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:44,040
to ensure government policy, the
policies on which we were elected

29
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:48,802
and for which we have a mandate, the
policies for which the people voted,

30
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:54,563
are the policies which, finally, when
the national cake has been divided up...

31
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:59,722
And may I remind you we, as a
nation, don't have unlimited wealth?

32
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,640
We can't pay ourselves more than we earn.

33
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:05,003
...are the policies...

34
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,837
I'm sorry, what was the question again?

35
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:17,320
I was just asking you whether you would
agree that your predecessor had failed.

36
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,955
Certainly not. On the contrary.

37
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:23,277
It's just that this job is an enormous...

38
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,957
- Challenge?
- Exactly!

39
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:34,081
Incidentally, I heard your chap
on the radio yesterday, Humpy.

40
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,079
- Mm?
- Mm.

41
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:42,075
He sounded as if he wanted to DO things
about your new local government remit.

42
00:03:42,247 --> 00:03:44,681
He kept calling it a challenge.

43
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:46,645
- Congratulations.
- Very kind.

44
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,718
You may soon be even more
important than Arnold!

45
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,996
- Yes, I expect... Er, no, no, no, no, no.
- I do want to be quite clear about this.

46
00:03:56,168 --> 00:04:00,764
I'd never have given you local government
if I'd thought you'd let Hacker do anything.

47
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:05,478
- He won't be able to. Nobody else has.
- That's not the point, Humpy.

48
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:10,038
We've found in the past that all
local government reforms rebound on us.

49
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:14,485
When anybody finds a way of saving money
or cutting staff in local government,

50
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:16,764
it works for Whitehall just as well.

51
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes, but local government is extravagant,
overstaffed, incompetent, whereas we...

52
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:28,161
- Exactly so.
- I know my duty, Arnold.

53
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:33,041
If he needs something to keep
him busy, you know what to do?

54
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,596
Get him to look into civil defence.

55
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:40,687
- Civil defence? You mean fallout shelters?
- Yes.

56
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:45,045
Governments long ago decided civil
defence was not a serious issue.

57
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,004
Merely a desperate one!

58
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:52,322
It's best left to those whose
incompetence can be relied upon.

59
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,478
Local authorities!

60
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:59,956
But the highest duty of government
is to protect its citizens.

61
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:03,916
Presumably that's why they
leave it to the borough councils!

62
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:13,081
Thank you, gentlemen.

63
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:19,038
Can I have a word about a proposal I worked out
before we were transferred to this department?

64
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:22,562
- And you are?
- I am... what?

65
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:26,837
- Yes, you are what?
- What?

66
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:31,843
- What?
- I am Dr Cartwright.

67
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:35,238
If I may put it another way, what are you?

68
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,718
I'm C of E.

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,000
The Minister means, what function
do you perform in the department?

70
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:49,365
- Don't you know?
- Yes, I know, but the Minister wants to know.

71
00:05:49,528 --> 00:05:54,123
I'm a professional economist. Director
of Local Administration Statistics.

72
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:57,485
You ran the Local Authority
Directorate before we took over.

73
00:05:57,647 --> 00:06:00,844
Dear me, no. Sir Gordon Reid
was the Permanent Secretary.

74
00:06:01,007 --> 00:06:05,206
I'm just Under-Secretary rank.
I fear I shall rise no higher.

75
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:08,360
- Why not?
- Alas, I'm an expert.

76
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:12,961
- On what?
- On the whole thing.

77
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:16,163
- It's all in here.
- What's this all about?

78
00:06:16,327 --> 00:06:18,601
Controlling council expenditure.

79
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:22,759
I'm proposing that all council
officials responsible for a new project

80
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:26,123
list their criteria for failure
before getting the go-ahead.

81
00:06:27,087 --> 00:06:32,081
- What do you mean?
- It's a basic scientific approach.

82
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:37,036
You must establish a method of measuring
the success or failure of an experiment.

83
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:40,563
When it's completed, you know
if it's succeeded or failed.

84
00:06:42,406 --> 00:06:46,401
A proposer states "This scheme would
fail if it lasts longer than this

85
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:50,560
"or costs more than that, if
it employs more staff than these

86
00:06:50,726 --> 00:06:53,117
"or fails to meet pre-set standards."

87
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:58,485
- Fantastic! You could never make it work.
- 'Course you can. It's all in there.

88
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:03,276
This is my top priority reading.
Why hasn't it been done before?

89
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:08,440
I can't understand. I put it up several
times and it was always welcomed most warmly.

90
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:14,795
- But there was always something more urgent on.
- Well, you've come to the right place this time.

91
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,959
Thank you, Minister.

92
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:25,683
This is marvellous, isn't it, Bernard?

93
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:29,197
Isn't it, Bernard?

94
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:35,598
Oh, yes. Well, it's... er... That
is, it's... um... very well presented.

95
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:38,805
- Humphrey will be fascinated.
- He's on his way here.

96
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:41,879
- He'll give his views.
- What are you saying?

97
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:47,601
Yes, well, as I say, I think that he'll
think that it's beautifully... typed.

98
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:53,355
- Ah, Minister.
- Ah, Humphrey, come in.

99
00:07:53,528 --> 00:07:55,245
- Sit down.
- Thank you, Minister.

100
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:59,442
Now, local authorities.
What are we going to do?

101
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:04,843
Minister, this new remit gives you
more influence, more Cabinet seniority.

102
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:09,798
But do not let it give you any more
work or worry. That would be foolishness.

103
00:08:09,968 --> 00:08:13,926
We've got to stop this
appalling waste and extravagance.

104
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,404
Why?

105
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:18,956
- Why?
- Yes, why?

106
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:23,519
Well, it's my job. We're the
government. We were elected to govern.

107
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,678
Oh, really, Minister.

108
00:08:27,127 --> 00:08:33,283
Surely you won't tamper with the democratic
rights of freely-elected local representatives?

109
00:08:34,288 --> 00:08:37,280
Well... no, of course not.

110
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:41,442
But local government isn't
democratic. Local democracy's a farce!

111
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:46,807
Most people don't know who their councillor
is. They never vote in a local election.

112
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:50,961
Those who do regard it as a popularity
poll for the government here.

113
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,847
Local councillors are
accountable to nobody.

114
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,399
They're public-spirited citizens
selflessly sacrificing their spare time.

115
00:08:58,568 --> 00:09:01,401
- Ever met any?
- When there was no alternative.

116
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:08,041
They're either busybodies on an ego trip
or in it for what they can get out of it.

117
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:11,644
Perhaps they ought to be
in the House of Commons.

118
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:15,562
Er, I mean, to see how a proper
legislative assembly behaves.

119
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:21,841
- I'm going to get a grip on them. I have a plan.
- You have a plan?

120
00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:24,606
Yes.

121
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:29,762
I'm going to insist that any local official
who puts up a plan costing more than...

122
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:34,524
...say... £10,000 must accompany
it with failure standards.

123
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:39,280
- With what?!
- With a statement saying he will have failed

124
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:43,442
if his project does not achieve
certain... pre-set results...

125
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:49,602
...or exceeds... fixed time
or staff or budget limits.

126
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:53,966
Where did you get the idea
for this dangerous nonsense?

127
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,245
From someone... in the department.

128
00:09:56,408 --> 00:10:02,245
I have warned you before about the danger
of speaking to people in the department!

129
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:07,687
I implore you to stay out of the minefield of
local government. It is a political graveyard.

130
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:12,841
Excuse me, Sir Humphrey, you cannot
have a graveyard in a minefield

131
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:15,805
because all the corpses would... powww!

132
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,798
- You got me this job, you said.
- But I didn't expect you to do anything.

133
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,164
I mean, you've never done anything before!

134
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,798
- Humphrey, I am deaf to your complaints.
- Please, I beg you...

135
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:35,405
No, no, no, no, Humphrey. I want
specific proposals straight away.

136
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:41,518
And immediate plans for their implementation
by local government. What's the fuss about?

137
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:46,159
I'm only proposing failure standards
for local government, not Whitehall.

138
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:51,322
- Though come to think of it...
- If you insist on interfering in local government,

139
00:10:51,488 --> 00:10:55,197
may I make a suggestion that
could prove a vote winner?

140
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:58,360
Humphrey, I want to hear no more about...

141
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,959
Vote winner?

142
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,120
An area of local government
that needs urgent attention.

143
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,278
- What?
- Civil defence.

144
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:14,202
You mean fallout shelters?
Surely they're just a joke.

145
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,564
Precisely, Minister. At
the moment, they are a joke.

146
00:11:17,727 --> 00:11:22,120
Local authorities are dragging their feet,
but the highest duty of any government

147
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:24,483
is to protect its citizens.

148
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,117
Some think building shelters
makes nuclear war more likely.

149
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:31,280
If you have the weapons,
you need the shelters.

150
00:11:31,448 --> 00:11:36,919
- Sometimes wonder why we need the weapons.
- Minister, you're not a unilateralist?

151
00:11:37,088 --> 00:11:43,038
- Well... I sometimes wonder.
- Then you must resign from the government!

152
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:48,521
Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not THAT unilateralist.

153
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:53,524
- America will protect us from the Russians.
- Who's talking about the Russians?

154
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:57,727
- Well, the independent deterrent.
- It's to protect us against the French!

155
00:12:00,448 --> 00:12:02,245
The French?

156
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:06,160
- But that's astounding!
- Why?

157
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,718
- Well, they're our allies, our partners.
- They are NOW.

158
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:13,722
But they've been our enemies
for most of the past 900 years.

159
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:17,278
If they've got the bomb,
we must have the bomb!

160
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:22,363
If it's for the French, of course,
that's different. Makes a lot of sense.

161
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:26,361
- Yes. Can't trust the Frogs.
- You can say that again!

162
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:29,519
There is increasing public
concern about the bomb.

163
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:33,885
If I were to be seen to be doing
something about it... I see what you mean.

164
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:39,399
Ludovic Kennedy is preparing a
BBC documentary on civil defence

165
00:12:39,568 --> 00:12:42,365
likely to be critical
of the current situation.

166
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,280
If you were seen to be
taking decisive measures...

167
00:12:45,448 --> 00:12:47,245
Right, yes.

168
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:51,318
I always handle Ludo so frightfully well.

169
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:56,483
- Right, well, where do we start?
- Just a suggestion.

170
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:02,201
The London Borough of Thames Marsh spends
less on civil defence than any other authority.

171
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,722
Hm. A ministerial visit, do you think?

172
00:13:04,887 --> 00:13:09,677
That's Ben Stanley's borough
- the one with the wispy moustache, who the press all hate.

173
00:13:09,847 --> 00:13:16,004
Good point. Get onto it straight away. Get Bill
to make sure the press knows about this visit.

174
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:22,961
Tell them I lie awake at night worrying about
the defenceless citizens of Thames Marsh.

175
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,838
Do you, Minister?

176
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:30,596
Well, I will now.

177
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:42,004
What makes you think you can come
swanning down here from Whitehall

178
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,557
and tell us how to run our borough?

179
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,718
I'm not swanning down from Whitehall.

180
00:13:46,887 --> 00:13:50,358
I'm asking you why you've done
less than any other borough

181
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,722
to protect the people who elected you?

182
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:57,120
- Simple. We can't find the money.
- Why don't you try looking for it?

183
00:13:57,927 --> 00:14:02,001
Oh, that's great! Stop school
meals, buy no textbooks?

184
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:06,206
- Turn OAPs out into the cold?
- I can tell you where to find it.

185
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,562
- You can?
- Yes.

186
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,764
Tell him, Dr Cartwright.

187
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:19,396
Scrap the plans for the new exhibition centre
with the artificial ski slope and jacuzzi pool.

188
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:21,559
Close the Feminist Drama Centre,

189
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:26,483
the council's weekly newspaper and magazine
and the Welfare Rights Research Department.

190
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,197
You can halve the members'
entertainments allowance,

191
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:34,963
sell the Mayor's second Daimler, postpone
the building of the new town hall,

192
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,519
and cancel the 20 councillors' tourism
fact-finding mission to Jamaica.

193
00:14:41,887 --> 00:14:44,276
And close the Gay Bereavement Centre.

194
00:14:48,649 --> 00:14:54,201
That'll save £21 millions on capital account
and £750,000 a year on revenue account.

195
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,164
Revenue account.

196
00:14:57,768 --> 00:14:59,963
- That's just stupid!
- Why?

197
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:04,280
Well, it's depriving the disadvantaged
of indispensable services!

198
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:09,680
- Jacuzzi pools?
- I don't care if we can afford a shelter.

199
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:14,160
This is a unilateralist borough.
We do not believe in nuclear war.

200
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:18,798
I don't believe in it either, but the
provision of shelters is government policy.

201
00:15:18,968 --> 00:15:24,088
It is not Thames Marsh policy. Thames
Marsh has no quarrel with the USSR.

202
00:15:24,247 --> 00:15:28,399
It's not just the USSR we're
frightened of. It could be the Fre...

203
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:35,115
- The who?
- The... frigging Chinese!

204
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:43,043
If the Russians do invade
us, I suppose they'll say,

205
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:48,680
"Hold on, we're not at war with Thames Marsh.
Right, comrades, let's annex Chelsea instead."

206
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:53,557
Excuse me, Minister. I think
you may be interested in...

207
00:15:56,608 --> 00:16:02,079
Mr Stanley, it appears that you would not
be called upon to make the supreme sacrifice.

208
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:06,605
- What do you mean?
- Is there a shelter under the town hall?

209
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,925
Well, is there?

210
00:16:10,088 --> 00:16:12,807
- We didn't build it!
- You maintain it.

211
00:16:14,168 --> 00:16:18,240
- It's only a small one.
- And there is a place in it for you?

212
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:24,245
I was persuaded, with deep reluctance,
that my preservation was a necessity

213
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:27,879
in the interests of the
ratepayers of Thames Marsh.

214
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:33,838
And what provision have you made for other
essential persons? Doctors, nurses, firemen.

215
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,797
People who might be almost
as important as councillors.

216
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:40,356
One of them's a chemist!

217
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:44,486
Great. Nothing like aspirin
for the nuclear holocaust.

218
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:51,044
Your chap had quite a publicity
triumph down at Thames Marsh, didn't he?

219
00:16:51,207 --> 00:16:55,519
- Oh, yes, tremendous.
- You don't sound appropriately happy for him.

220
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:59,680
- Trouble is he thinks he's achieved something.
- Splendid.

221
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:04,318
Life is so much easier when ministers
think they've achieved something.

222
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:07,081
Stops them fretting. No tantrums.

223
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:10,728
Now he wants to introduce his next idea.

224
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:15,677
A minister with two ideas. I can't
remember when we last had one of those.

225
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:19,278
Oh, it's not his own.

226
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:25,237
He wants to introduce failure standards
on all council contracts over £10,000

227
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:27,797
and make a named official responsible.

228
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:29,559
- Humphrey!
- I know.

229
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:33,355
Cartwright's idiot scheme! I
thought Gordon had squashed it.

230
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:39,841
He's come over to us now. Slipped the scheme
to the minister privately, under plain cover!

231
00:17:40,648 --> 00:17:45,437
It'll be us next. Once you specify in
advance what a project's supposed to achieve

232
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:50,603
and whose responsibility it is to see
that it does, the entire system collapses.

233
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:54,157
You're into the squalid world
of professional management.

234
00:17:54,327 --> 00:17:56,716
I know. I've tried to explain to him.

235
00:17:56,887 --> 00:18:03,362
I have pointed out that his new responsibilities
were for enjoying, not exercising. I don't know.

236
00:18:03,528 --> 00:18:09,125
We move our officials round every 2 or 3 years
to stop this personal responsibility nonsense.

237
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,677
If this happened, we'd be posting
everybody once a fortnight.

238
00:18:12,847 --> 00:18:17,239
He must be stopped. What's
his next little publicity trip?

239
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:21,846
Well, tomorrow he's living
his little triumph over again.

240
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:27,480
He's recording a TV interview with Ludovic
Kennedy. A documentary on civil defence.

241
00:18:28,648 --> 00:18:34,041
Supposing he had a dossier on the
curious ways in which local councillors

242
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,802
spend their civil defence budgets.

243
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:40,199
- How would that help?
- I've got an idea.

244
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:43,405
Perhaps you ought to become a minister!

245
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,242
Um... just a joke, Arnold.

246
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:52,721
Stand by, studio. We're about to record.

247
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:57,882
A change for a minister to be given a chance
to talk about something that's a success.

248
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:02,086
Most unusual for the BBC.
Is this a change of policy?

249
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:04,125
...2... 1.

250
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:08,487
You've been claiming recently that
in your dealings with local authority,

251
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,798
you've been making progress
as regards civil defence.

252
00:19:11,969 --> 00:19:16,086
Surely this has been more in the field
of publicity than any achievement?

253
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,443
No, no, no, no, Ludo.

254
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:22,157
Authorities are being made
to face up to these issues

255
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,081
because of the interest we have generated.

256
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,956
You're agreeing. Your success
has been a publicity success.

257
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,882
Well, yes, but things are changing.

258
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:36,326
- Well, what about Thames Marsh?
- Ah, Thames Marsh. Good example.

259
00:19:36,489 --> 00:19:39,445
As I said in the press,
they have one shelter.

260
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:42,963
A place in it is reserved for
Ben Stanley, council leader,

261
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,800
who refuses to build shelters for others.

262
00:19:45,969 --> 00:19:47,960
Don't you think that's hypocritical?

263
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:54,317
Surely it's reasonable to expect that one of
our elected representatives should survive.

264
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:58,197
- Who is to govern otherwise? - In
the event of a nuclear holocaust -

265
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,362
and, of course, we all pray that
such a thing will never happen -

266
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:06,726
there are perhaps more important
people than mere politicians.

267
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:12,440
Doctors, nurses, ambulance men, and so
on. All people who run essential services.

268
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:17,603
Correct me if I'm wrong, but is it not
a fact that the PM and Home Secretary

269
00:20:17,768 --> 00:20:22,160
have places reserved for them
in government fallout shelters?

270
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:24,364
That is completely different.

271
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,885
How?

272
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:32,245
Well, there has to be someone
to... run the... you know.

273
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:37,800
Minister, you're saying political leaders should
give up their places for doctors and nurses.

274
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,802
Have you put this idea to
the PM and the Home Secretary?

275
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:47,678
I think we ought to be careful not to
trivialise what is a very serious issue, Ludovic.

276
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:53,806
I'll give you another example. I know
of a borough which sent councillors,

277
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:57,757
at the ratepayers' expensive, to
California to look at shelters.

278
00:20:57,927 --> 00:21:00,123
But they couldn't do anything about it

279
00:21:00,288 --> 00:21:05,806
because they'd spent the entire civil defence
budget for three whole years on the trip!

280
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:08,923
- How shocking.
- Shocking.

281
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:14,876
Thank you, Minister. By the
way, how did the recording go?

282
00:21:15,048 --> 00:21:19,041
Well, I got into a bit of
bother over Ben Stanley's bunker.

283
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:22,916
I said politicians weren't as
important as doctors and so on.

284
00:21:23,088 --> 00:21:25,396
Did you?

285
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:29,960
Then he said "What about the PM's
place in the government shelter?"

286
00:21:30,128 --> 00:21:33,326
- And what did you say?
- I got out of it.

287
00:21:33,489 --> 00:21:35,480
Quite cleverly, actually.

288
00:21:35,648 --> 00:21:39,641
I'm not too sure how happy
the PM will be about it.

289
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:43,403
Then I recovered with a marvellous
story about some councillors

290
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,163
who went to California to look at shelters

291
00:21:46,327 --> 00:21:51,038
and spent three entire years of the
civil defence budget on the jaunt!

292
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,001
- May I ask where that came from?
- Yes. Where did that come from?

293
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:02,798
From the Civil Defence Directorate.
They knew you were doing the interview.

294
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:08,320
Oh, well. Anyway, Minister, I'm
sure you know what you're doing.

295
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:13,639
Humphrey... you only say that when
I've made an appalling cock-up.

296
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:21,278
You do know the borough in question
contains the PM's constituency...

297
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:28,041
...and that the PM's election agent was
the councillor who led the delegation?

298
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:38,117
- That was just a joke, wasn't it?
- Number 10 have been trying to keep it quiet.

299
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:41,485
- Oh, well, truth will out.
- No, no, no!

300
00:22:41,648 --> 00:22:46,768
No, no, no, it mustn't out. It
might look like a personal attack.

301
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:51,797
You know what the PM's like about
loyalty. This interview must not go out.

302
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:55,961
Well, unfortunately, I haven't
the time, I must be going.

303
00:22:56,128 --> 00:23:00,838
Humphrey, I... I... I...
I'm ordering you, Humphrey.

304
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:05,001
- Alas, your orders are calling me away.
- What do you mean?

305
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:09,958
Your scheme for imposing failure standards
on local councils is very complex.

306
00:23:10,128 --> 00:23:14,724
You asked for proposals straight away.
It's taking every moment of my time.

307
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:17,083
Much as I would like to help.

308
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:24,644
However... if implementing failure
standards were not quite so urgent...

309
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,480
You mean, you can stop this broadcast?

310
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:31,242
Now, Minister, we cannot censor the BBC,

311
00:23:31,407 --> 00:23:35,242
but I happen to be lunching with
the BBC's Director of Policy.

312
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:39,288
- Perhaps you'd care to join us.
- But if we can't censor them...

313
00:23:39,449 --> 00:23:43,442
We could persuade them to
withdraw programmes voluntarily

314
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:47,317
once they realise that transmission
is not in the public interest.

315
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:54,204
Well, it's not in MY interest... and I represent
the public, so it's not in the public interest.

316
00:23:57,648 --> 00:23:59,639
That's a novel argument.

317
00:24:01,768 --> 00:24:05,282
We haven't tried that
on them before. Have we?

318
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,077
The BBC cannot give in
to government pressure.

319
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:13,047
- Let's leave that on one side...
- No, no!

320
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:17,519
Let's leave that on one side,
shall we? Please, Minister.

321
00:24:17,687 --> 00:24:19,918
Frank, could I raise something else?

322
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:26,405
There is considerable disquiet about the BBC's
attitude and hostility towards the government.

323
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:30,244
- But that's absurd.
- Is it?

324
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:36,244
They've been documenting instances
of bias in BBC current affairs.

325
00:24:36,407 --> 00:24:39,240
Favourable news stories not reported.

326
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:44,958
Oh, yes. Excessive publicity for
other countries' cases against Britain.

327
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:48,882
Especially our Common Market enemies...

328
00:24:49,048 --> 00:24:51,925
...um... partners.

329
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:54,079
Oh, yes.

330
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:57,081
Jokes against the Prime Minister.

331
00:24:57,248 --> 00:25:00,956
Unnecessary publicity for
anti-government demonstrations.

332
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:05,440
And ministers' programme
suggestions not accepted.

333
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:12,681
- I had no room in my case for the others.
- I'm sure we have answers to all these.

334
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:15,840
The BBC's always got answers. Silly ones.

335
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:20,637
Yes, of course. I thought it fair to
warn you that questions are being asked.

336
00:25:21,407 --> 00:25:25,195
- What sort of questions?
- Well, for example,

337
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:30,362
were Parliament to be televised,
whether it shouldn't be entrusted to ITV.

338
00:25:31,927 --> 00:25:36,318
- You can't be serious?
- And whether the BBC administration

339
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:40,878
is making the cuts in jobs and premises
that we've endured in government.

340
00:25:41,048 --> 00:25:44,643
Should a select committee
scrutinise BBC expenditure?

341
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:48,355
- That would be an intolerable intrusion.
- Well, of course.

342
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:54,125
Then there's this extraordinary matter of
boxes at Ascot, Wimbledon, Lords, Covent Garden.

343
00:25:55,407 --> 00:26:00,800
Ah, yes, those are a technical requirement
for the production and engineering staff.

344
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:07,119
Reports from the Inland Revenue suggest
that the production and engineering staff

345
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,677
are all holding champagne glasses.

346
00:26:10,687 --> 00:26:14,157
And are all accompanied
by their wives or...

347
00:26:14,327 --> 00:26:18,367
...ladies of... equal distinction.

348
00:26:20,687 --> 00:26:22,884
And all bear a remarkable similarity

349
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:28,442
to governors, directors and executives
of the Corporation, and their friends.

350
00:26:28,608 --> 00:26:31,327
Oh, I say, you've come out very well.

351
00:26:34,048 --> 00:26:40,396
It is possible we can contain all this criticism,
provided the files don't get any larger.

352
00:26:40,568 --> 00:26:45,768
I've urged my minister that there's no need
to take up the civil defence issue formally.

353
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,646
But... But you must see my position.

354
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:56,318
- The BBC can't give in to government pressure.
- We wouldn't want them to.

355
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,762
- Wouldn't we?
- No, of course not.

356
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:03,079
The minister's interview with Ludovic
Kennedy did contain factual errors.

357
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:08,083
Factual errors? That's different. The BBC
couldn't give in to government pressure.

358
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:12,719
- Absolutely not.
- But we set great store by factual accuracy.

359
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:16,882
Some of the information might
well be out of date by the time...

360
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:19,768
Out of date? Ah, now, that's serious.

361
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:22,885
Obviously, the BBC couldn't
give in to government pressure.

362
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:27,326
- Oh, indeed not. - But we can't
transmit out-of-date material.

363
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:31,721
And since the recording, I realised
that I made one or two slips

364
00:27:31,887 --> 00:27:34,605
that might have security implications.

365
00:27:34,768 --> 00:27:38,125
- Such as?
- He can't tell you what they are.

366
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,601
- Why not?
- Security.

367
00:27:43,768 --> 00:27:45,759
Can't be too careful about security.

368
00:27:45,927 --> 00:27:49,715
If the defence of the realm is
at stake, we must be responsible.

369
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:53,675
Obviously, the BBC couldn't
give in to government pressure,

370
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:56,237
but security
- you can't be too careful.

371
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,797
- Can't be too careful.
- Can't be too careful.

372
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:04,166
If there are inaccuracies and security worries,
the BBC wouldn't want to put the interview out.

373
00:28:04,327 --> 00:28:08,766
- Precisely.
- That puts a different complexion on it.

374
00:28:08,927 --> 00:28:14,684
Transmission would not be in the public's interest,
but I must make one thing absolutely clear.

375
00:28:14,847 --> 00:28:20,719
There can be absolutely no question of the
BBC ever giving in to government pressure.

376
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:24,199
Oh, good news, Minister.

377
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,405
The BBC have decided not to send out
your interview with Ludovic Kennedy.

378
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,605
- Really?
- They felt that was the responsible course.

379
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:34,759
- Well done.
- Oh, it was nothing.

380
00:28:34,927 --> 00:28:38,204
Yet, you know, I can't help feeling

381
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:43,396
that I was trapped into saying those
things that might've embarrassed the PM.

382
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,559
- Surely not?
- Yes.

383
00:28:46,489 --> 00:28:52,677
- I think I was dropped right in it.
- How could you think such a ridiculous thought?

384
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:57,161
Why is it ridiculous to imagine
that he would've tried to trap me?

385
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,125
Who?

386
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:01,278
Ludovic Kennedy.

387
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,402
Oh, Ludovic Kennedy tried to trap
you. Yes, well, I'm sure he did.

388
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:11,119
- Deceitful crowd, the media. Underhand.
- No, thoroughly deceitful.

389
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:15,599
By the way, I think it might be
wise to lay off the local councils.

390
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:17,086
Oh, yes?

391
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:21,844
After all, councillors are responsible,
sensible people on the whole.

392
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:25,000
- And they are democratically elected.
- Democratically elected.

393
00:29:25,168 --> 00:29:30,163
Central government must be frightfully careful
before it tells them how to do their jobs.

394
00:29:30,327 --> 00:29:34,402
Frightfully careful. And
the failure standards?

395
00:29:34,568 --> 00:29:38,766
Well, I think the same
applies... don't you?

396
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:40,519
Yes, Minister.
