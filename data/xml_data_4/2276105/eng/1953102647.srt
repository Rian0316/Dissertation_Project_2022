1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:04,070
How could ketchup get this hard?

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,420
You just hold it in your hand like this, and say

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,940
You are the biggest ketchup I've ever had.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,580
Hey, everybody. I got it, I got it.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,020
Don't panic. At least you caught it in the early stage. 

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,840
No, I got the papers so we can see if our ticket win the lottery. 

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,840
120 million dollars.

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,050
Fine. If we win, I will get an eighth of my trust fund back.

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,660
Come on. Now, who's got our ticket?

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,990
I've got the ticket. I put it here.

11
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,990
I figured it's for everybody else gets lucky.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,890
By the way, if we win,

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,970
I'm gonna buy a condo right next to Great Adventure and go there everyday drunk.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,020
Also put a soda fridge in my garage for show.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,310
Earl, what are you gonna do with your share if we win?

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,890
Well, I'll get out of this club chop as fast as I can,

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,390
and set me up with some kind of  Hugh Hefner  situation.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,900
Here we go, for the big money.

19
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,380
Woo. If I win, hello Netflix subscription.

20
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,580
We need a six, a ten, a five, a 12 and a nine.

21
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
And the first number is¡­6!

22
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,550
And the second number is 47.

23
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,630
Good thing I didn't pay my share of the tickets yet, suckers!

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,390
Before I forget, I printed up more of our cupcake business cards

27
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,600
So we can hand them out at the Williamsburg crafts fair.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,070
Oh, can't wait

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,050
Me and you handing out free cupcakes 

30
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,920
stuck between hipsters selling crochet

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,890
iPad sleeves and salt peppers and salt pepper shakers.

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,620
We are not just giving them away for free. It's marketing. 

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,090
One person eats it and spreads it around their friends.

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,480
So we are herpes.

35
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,140
Hello, Sophie.

36
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,590
If you looked any sweeter, you would fire up my diabetes.

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,300
Oh, Earl. You wouldn't be the first man to lose a limo over me.

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,930
Sophie, I'm surprised to see you in here.

39
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,980
Stutter buzz says you and Oleg are no longer together.

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,040
Wow, this little girl likes to gossip. Yes?

41
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,740
Won't you scutter your little butt over there

42
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,840
and get me the menu the way you are supposed to?

43
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Hey, Max, Caroline.

44
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,010
Come see me in my booth.

45
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,200
Are we over here so Oleg can't see you through the kitchen window?

46
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,380
What is this? Diner or back issue of Cosmopolitan magazines?

47
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,630
I grew up reading Cosmo. 

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,300
 I mean, what a six-year-old doesn't need to know? The hidden male erogenous zones.

49
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,300
It's the nipples, the end.

50
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,600
I came to give you girls a cleaning job tomorrow.

51
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,920
We can't tomorrow. We are doing the crafts fair.

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,430
We are turning down a real paying job to go to the crap fair?

53
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes, it's important that we focus on the cupcake business.

54
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,780
And you can't spell "focus" without "us".

55
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,870
Or FU.

56
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
Hello, Sophie.

57
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,400
Hello, Oleg.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,950
So, do you miss the sex?

59
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,240
Oh, you know what? We should go.

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,850
No. We are having a conversation here.

61
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,310
And besides, the sex was not that good.

62
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,710
Oh, it was that good.

63
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,230
It wasn't that good.

64
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,230
Please, I beg you. Let us go.

65
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,230
You can go. I'm kind of into it.

66
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,250
Like, it's like a dirty Downton Abbey.

67
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,760
So why are you still standing there

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,370
giving me those sad, cow eyes 

69
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,370
in that brown velure.

70
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,370
Because it's a good look on me.

71
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,180
And because I'm waiting for you to admit that you came here

72
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,630
because you miss the sex.

73
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,190
I miss summers in Minsk. 

74
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,790
I miss smoking in hospitals.

75
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,030
But I don't miss the sex.

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Fine, then. What would you like to eat?

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,870
I'll have my usual sausage.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,600
Ok, ding. It's ready.

79
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,580
Max's homemade cupcakes.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
Max's delicious homemade cupcakes

81
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,470
- Let's move this along. Max's homemade cupcakes. - Max.

82
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,260
come on. Could you at least try and have a better attitude at the crafts fair?

83
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,450
I was doing fine until my hair got gang feather by that girl from that church of good vibes.

84
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,700
Hi!

85
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,998
I'm from the Funnel Cake booth back there

86
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:52,790
and your little table is sadder than watching the notebook at a funeral.

87
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,000
Hey Dutch girl,

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,370
why don't you go stick your finger in a dyke.

89
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,340
I'm sure you can find one over near the plus sized in them.

90
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,070
Max, please. We are all business woman here. 

91
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,260
Yeah. Some of us wearing table cloth on their heads.

92
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,590
Just so you know they make shift tables cause we are just starting out.

93
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,480
We've only been in business eight months.

94
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,590
Heidi, how long have we been funneling?

95
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,400
Everyday 24-7 for the past three months.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,370
And we already have a booth.

97
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,820
Yeah we do.

98
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,140
I have to say you girls really take the fun out of funnel.

99
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,430
Actually we put the fun in the funnel.

100
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,900
See? You can't start "funnel" without "fun".

101
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,900
Or FU.

102
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,200
Three months and they've already had a booth. We're behind.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Max's homemade cupcakes. 

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,030
Take this!

105
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,220
See? Success!

106
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,170
Scaring people into participating isn't success.

107
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,030
It's Scientology.

108
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,890
Calling Sophie we're taking that job.

109
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,730
You'd better have a good reason you're late,

110
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,600
because I managed to get here on time despite removing the disease pigeon feathers from my hair.

111
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,280
I do.

112
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,990
So today when we were cleaning up that apartment and I had my hands in a total stranger's toilet,

113
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,110
I realized if we're really gonna be successful, we've got to think outside the bull.

114
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
So after I thoroughly washed my hands, 

115
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,550
I know they never really come off though, right?

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,980
Off your soul, I mean.

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,830
I made a call to a connection I know and got us a real cupcake job.

118
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,280
And it's in Manhattan. It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.

119
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,860
60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.

120
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,120
Buttercream?

121
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,010
This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.

122
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,670
I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy. 

123
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,420
Why? Is your business partner on a show of Nicklodeon?

124
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Look I don't do buttercream. 

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,840
Buttercream is a bitch.

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,890
If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.

127
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,690
Max we have to take this job, it's the next step for us, 

128
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,070
cause all we're doing these days is cleaning apartment and working at the diner.

129
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,880
That's not all I'm doing. I also babysit for Peach.

130
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
Oh, Peach is fine with it.

131
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,280
Why would Peach be fine with it?

132
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,250
Look I was gonna tell you this after the Nickelodeon high five

133
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,740
but that didn't happen and I got thrown.

134
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,050
Peach is the connection I used to get us the party.

135
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,300
You called Peach without asking me and begged her for a job?

136
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,195
I didn't beg. I ask her if she knew anybody who could use us

137
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,780
and she was more than happy to recommend us for her friend Constance.

138
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,100
No way I'm not comfortable with this.

139
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,680
Sometimes you have to do things that make you uncomfortable.

140
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,753
It's the way you grow.

141
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:54,560
No it's the way you get a ride home from a keger in the woods.

142
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,990
♪Max
Max.

143
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,440
Max Max I'm sorry but we can't turn into those people who work and work

144
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,590
just to pay their bill don't have any time to pursue their dreams.

145
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,970
You mean Americans?

146
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:11,060
I'm telling Peach tomorrow we're not doing it. Now go get some milk.

147
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,670
No problem cause that's what waitresses do and

148
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,670
apparently that's all we'll ever be.

149
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,440
What? 

150
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,090
I have to prove the sex was not that good.

151
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,030
Oleg on the food?

152
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,320
Don't say it like that,

153
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,920
That ham was already glaced before we go there. 

154
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,350
So I am guessing you are back together?

155
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,080
Oh no no, the sex was not that good.

156
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,950
Oh, it was that good.

157
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,360
I went to get Mayo,

158
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,360
and it all happened so fast.

159
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,450
Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.

160
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,941
Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment, 

161
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,090
but I would like it on the record:

162
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,270
I'm not a willing accomplice.

163
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,510
So what is going on here?

164
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,430
Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake

165
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,180
and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.

166
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,730
This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?

167
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,760
Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?

168
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,380
It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,

169
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,780
I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?

170
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,780
And original.

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,790
I had a blog since my friend Constance started her blog,

172
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,380
we both have blogs and we both have babies.

173
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,490
Only her babies are adopted from Africa.

174
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,500
She will be winning if I didn't have two from a poor white hell billy thuggery.

175
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,760
About your friend Constance, I think I was supposed to do a party for her.

176
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,070
Max, please don't screw this up because I hate her and I need her to love me.

177
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,710
Yea, here is the thing. Thank you,

178
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,520
but Caroline should never have called you and asked you for a favor.

179
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,964
I'm not comfortable asking to do that.

180
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:38,446
But I did it for you.

181
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:40,161
And now you will do that for me.

182
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,410
And Max this has to go swimmingly

183
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,380
which is a new word I just learned.

184
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,330
So you are saying I can't get out of it?

185
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm saying: Max, you can't get out of it.

186
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,570
Max, still not talking to me because of the Peach thing?

187
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,310
Fine.

188
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,600
Those are some pretty bad ass buttercream cupcakes,

189
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,890
ain't no drama going on in that box!

190
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,980
Ok, I just went gangster, and not even a smile?

191
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,250
What? Are you planning to never talk to me again?

192
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,710
You nodded, if you were deaf that would be talking.

193
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,210
That's true, my brother is deaf,

194
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,670
not from birth, from firecrackers.

195
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,761
Relax, we still have time.

196
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:26,345
Ten more minutes on the train and a 15-minute walk.

197
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,350
The buttercreams are not gonna melt.

198
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,050
- Some people just like to create non-verbal drama. - En huh.

199
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,780
Attention passengers.

200
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,880
- There is an obstruction up on the track ahead. - No.

201
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,550
I bet someone jumped in front of the train.

202
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,868
Oh my God, what a tragedy, 

203
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:47,930
the buttercream!

204
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,044
Attention passengers.

205
00:11:56,044 --> 00:11:58,051
We apologize for this delay.

206
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,590
There is still an obstruction on the tracks ahead.

207
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,870
It's totally like a body.

208
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,550
They can't get it off and what not.

209
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,360
We should be moving shortly.

210
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,140
What is with this guy? He said that 20 minutes ago.

211
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,870
How are your cupcakes? Mine are getting a little loose.

212
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,870
Still? Still not talking?

213
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,200
Fine, Max. Now I'm not talking neither.

214
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,640
What is with her? She said that 20 minutes ago, too.

215
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,470
And she just keeps talking.

216
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,610
I know, right?

217
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,160
We probably hit the body.

218
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,280
So it is all up in the wheeling and what not.

219
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,960
Well, if there is what not under our wheels, and I don't get these cupcakes there,

220
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,130
I'm going to lose my babysitting job.

221
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,155
- Are we babysitters or bakers? - I was talking to him.

222
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,758
Stay out of this.

223
00:12:41,758 --> 00:12:42,610
Nina,

224
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,236
if you two are bakers, maybe you should break up some of those cupcakes,

225
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,820
so we all don't starve.

226
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,665
No one is touching these cupcakes.

227
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:52,110
Our entire future is riding on these mothers.

228
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,160
I think I'm smelling like a, like a dead body smell.

229
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,650
Miss, you are making things so much worse in here.

230
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,510
Are you telling me you don't smell that?

231
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,180
It's like when my sister burned herself throwing firecrackers at my brother's ear.

232
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,190
This train is out of service.

233
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,520
We are approximately two blocks away from the next station.

234
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,060
We're gonna have to take you on foot.

235
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,140
Please form a single line and we will escort you to safety.

236
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,310
We are gonna walk?

237
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,890
They expect me to walk through a subway tunnel in heels?

238
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,970
Hey everybody I think we know who we are gonna eat first.

239
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,530
My god, it's so hot up in here. It's like 200 degrees.

240
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,124
If I faint and fall down,

241
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,290
the others rats will like eat me and what not.

242
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,890
Rats? Max, are there rats?

243
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,440
It's a subway. The floor is made of rats,

244
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,840
but you really have to worry about, the ninja turtles.

245
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,710
Thank you for responding.

246
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,770
Hold up.

247
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:48,830
I'm telling you right now. If I lose my babysitting job over this,

248
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,430
the rats would be the better option for you.

249
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,160
We are only two blocks from the station. We can still make it.

250
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,980
How are your cupcakes?

251
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,770
They are still holding together.

252
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,050
Like us. We are still holding together.

253
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,970
Geez, come on, don't bring gal. Less talk more walk.

254
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,380
Folks, It's a bit of gap here.

255
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,100
A gap? There can't be a gap. Why is there a gap?

256
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,450
Because people need reasonably price basics.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,320
I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.

258
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,206
Hey miss, you are next.

259
00:14:23,206 --> 00:14:25,117
I put the line on, just grab it.

260
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,873
You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,960
Hey, just take these.

262
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,150
Careful, sir, it's buttercream!

263
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,520
I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.

264
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,870
Thank you. Right. Thank you.

265
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,250
Ok, miss, you next.

266
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,250
Hand me over the cupcakes and jump.

267
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,662
I can't. I'm terrified.

268
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:52,875
What if I fall? The rats will eat me.

269
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,100
I can never come back from that.

270
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,711
Bankruptcy? Yes. Rats? No.

271
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:56,973
"Hey Caroline, where are your toes?"

272
00:14:56,973 --> 00:14:58,972
"Well, it's a long story."

273
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,446
Girl, if you fall that third rail,

274
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:03,181
it will fry you way before the rats get there.

275
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:06,244
Listen, Mariah, you are freaking me out.

276
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,460
If we're lucky, the rats will eat your mouth.

277
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,230
Caroline, it's ok. It's just a step. Take the step.

278
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,060
Hold these.

279
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,200
Come on, I'm right here.

280
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,670
I took the step, now you have to take the step.

281
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,650
That's right. You did. I do.

282
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,727
Here we go.

283
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,571
Back up everybody. Yea!

284
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,916
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

285
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,199
Go Caroline, go Caroline, go.

286
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,183
Go Caroline, go Caroline, ahhhhhhh!

287
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:37,680
I saw a rat. We made eye contact.

288
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,520
You know what? It would probably be easier if took those heels off.

289
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,251
Sir, that is never going to happen.

290
00:15:44,251 --> 00:15:45,521
We are in Manhattan.

291
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:48,670
I may be under it but I'm still in it.

292
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,152
And when they pull out my half-eaten body,

293
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:53,530
I will be wearing my heels.

294
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,002
Mariah?

295
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:01,536
Why? I only have one.

296
00:16:01,536 --> 00:16:02,197
What are you gonna do? 

297
00:16:02,197 --> 00:16:05,204
Jump back over and do something and whatnot?

298
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,040
Constance, we're sorry, we are late.

299
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,630
I don't wait. I don't wait for anything.

300
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,980
I already have the iPhone 8.

301
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,670
Sorry, we couldn't help it. We were trapped on the subway.

302
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,690
Well, just put some cupcakes on a plate

303
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,470
cause I got a roomful of women out there who need to cut something in half

304
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,440
and then eat the other half, and they need to do it now!

305
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,090
Welcome back to Manhattan. How do they look?

306
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,400
Like they all had unprotected sex with each other?

307
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,740
Oh, how are you two? I'm looking for the babies, I'm about just ten seconds I'm just giving up.

308
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,530
- Peach, there is a problem with the cupcakes.  - There can't be.

309
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,720
Constance will kill me, literally. Her last two best friends went missing.

310
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,760
That is not attractive at all.

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,440
Is... is that what food looks like?

312
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:00,030
Why are there no cupcakes out? If you two work for me, I deport you.

313
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,840
There is a bit of cupcake situation. The buttercream sort of broke down on the way up.

314
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,670
It's not a problem, we can fix it.

315
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:13,110
I'll just run to a delly get what we need to touch them up and no one's the wiser.

316
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,800
And I take the full responsibility. My partner warned me that buttercream was a bitch.

317
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:21,080
I'm not being rude, that's technical baking term.

318
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,140
You expect me to pay 300 dollars for these?

319
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,330
Caroline Channing, I have to say that you're a bigger con artist than your father.

320
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,050
Then I have to say you're a bigger bitch than the buttercream.

321
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,550
I'm not your boss, so I can't hit you.

322
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,610
But I'm sure that Peach won't be your boss much longer either.

323
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,380
Right, Peach?

324
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,000
But I love Max.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,370
She's been with me since I bought the twins.

326
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,900
I can't live without her.

327
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,660
You are never coming to another one of my parties.

328
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,880
Max, you're fired.

329
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,510
It's my fault. You lost your babysitting job, and I feel awful.

330
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,230
Hey, I'm the one who call that bitch a "bitch".

331
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,410
And I'm gonna write those awesome films right up until we got evicted.

332
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,980
Why can't you just admit that the sex was that good?

333
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,020
You know it, I know it, the ham with the bite marks in the freezer knows it.

334
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,460
Ok, fine. The sex was that good,

335
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,460
as was the ham.

336
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,700
It was that good because it was more than just sex.

337
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
It was love.

338
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,790
Oh... it is not love.

339
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,830
Oh, it is love.

340
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:41,070
Oh... it is not love.

341
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,990
It was dirty, disgusting sex.

342
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:49,540
Yes, it was.

343
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,770
Oleg, do you really love Sophie?

344
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,120
Yes, I do. And one day I will kiss her.

345
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,000
Her lips will be mine.

346
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,920
Wait, you never kissed her?

347
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,190
Not on the lips of her face.

348
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,130
But that day will come.

349
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:20,250
Man, I can't believe that I'm actually saying this,

350
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,340
but that is pretty freaking romantic.

351
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,920
I'm looking for Max, I think her last name is "Black".

352
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,070
Oh, sorry, maybe it's "African American"?

353
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,730
You think her name is "Max African American"?

354
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,190
Peach, what're you doing here? Who's with the twins?

355
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,200
They're in the car, don't worry,

356
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,920
I rolled up the windows and locked the doors, so they're safe.

357
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,220
Max, I'm sorry for pretending to fire you in front of the Constance.

358
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,270
Pretended? That felt pretty real.

359
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,800
Yeah, I'm good. My fake orgasms are so real even I believe them.

360
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,360
Peach, this is all my fault. Please give Max her job back.

361
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,950
That's why I'm here. Max, come back, I need you to watch them tomorrow,

362
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,680
and then everyday.

363
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,010
Peach, I don't think I can work for you tomorrow,

364
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,590
or any other day.

365
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,180
We have to focus on our business.

366
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,300
Max, are you sure you're comfortable with this?

367
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,040
No, I'm not comfortable, but that's the point, right?

368
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,420
You gotta take a step.

369
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,270
Well, then how about just for another year?

370
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:27,860
By then the twins will be old enough to take care of themselves.

371
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,940
No, but I promise I'll come by and say "Hi" to the twins whenever I can.

372
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,240
Oh, Max,

373
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,520
I will never find someone as wonderful as you who speaks English.

374
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,570
Bye, Max.

375
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,510
Wow, good for you, good for us.

376
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,640
Hope so. That's the first job I ever quit without a job to take its place.

377
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,250
You have another job. You work for yourself.

378
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,970
You're your own boss.

379
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,980
My own boss? I can't wait to sleep with myself to get a promotion.

380
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:07,750
