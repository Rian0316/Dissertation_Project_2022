1
00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:02,548
For those of you who
were too fucking busy,

2
00:00:02,668 --> 00:00:04,988
this is what happened
last week on <i>Shameless.</i>

3
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:06,990
I'm gonna give the
baby up for adoption.

4
00:00:07,024 --> 00:00:08,718
If there's a market
for babies out there,

5
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,051
I'm gonna corner my share.

6
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:11,383
I'd kind of like to have a say

7
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:12,615
in where this kid might end up.

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,481
What are you doing?
Sending cash

9
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,879
<i>to my sons.</i>

10
00:00:15,913 --> 00:00:17,046
Frank gets none.

11
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,880
My fucking brothers?!

12
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:20,052
That bitch!

13
00:00:20,087 --> 00:00:23,323
Presenting Frank and Monica Gallagher!

14
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,993
Holy shit.

15
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,796
<i>Monica comes home long</i>
<i>enough to reunite with Frank,</i>

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,969
<i>gets knocked up with</i>
<i>another kid and then splits.</i>

17
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,471
You look good, Moni.
You back on your meds?

18
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:34,739
I am <i>not</i> bipolar.

19
00:00:34,773 --> 00:00:36,174
<i>First thing she did--</i>

20
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:37,809
bust my balls for kicking Lip out.

21
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:39,543
School or leave!
<i>What are you doing?</i>

22
00:00:39,578 --> 00:00:41,680
I'm not going back to school, so...

23
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:42,817
I guess that means I'm leaving.

24
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,653
How long do you need to stay?

25
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:45,854
Just till I'm back on my feet.

26
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,821
<i>It'll piss her off so much,</i>

27
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,688
<i>she'll be back at your doorstep</i>
<i>in a heartbeat.</i>

28
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,857
Throw him out.
You don't always have

29
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:53,192
to be responsible for everyone, Fiona.

30
00:00:53,226 --> 00:00:56,061
Excuse me?
Monica's back. Enjoy it.

31
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,430
I'm here. Doesn't all
have to fall on you.

32
00:00:58,464 --> 00:01:00,065
<i>I'm not in love with her,</i>

33
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,167
<i>but I shit myself</i>
<i>every time I think about</i>

34
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,170
what her dad would do if dumped her.

35
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:05,271
She doesn't love you, either.

36
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,006
<i>She's got this other guy--</i>

37
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,209
<i>a Marco somebody.</i>

38
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:12,179
I'm importing him to the States;
I'm gonna surprise her.

39
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:13,880
Leaving you free and clear.

40
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,582
So when he gets in,
so do I. Deal.

41
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:19,451
Can't say he hasn't been working his
fine ass off trying to win you back.

42
00:01:19,486 --> 00:01:21,686
<i>Where the hell</i>
<i>did you get all that?</i>

43
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,687
I found it!

44
00:01:22,722 --> 00:01:23,855
Where's the Squirrel Fund?

45
00:01:23,889 --> 00:01:25,256
What the hell's a Squirrel Fund?

46
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,391
<i>The first rule you</i>
<i>learn in this house,</i>

47
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:29,359
you hide the goddamn money!

48
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:30,593
You promised me.

49
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:31,894
Get out of bed!

50
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,898
Get out of bed, Mom!

51

Hey, give me a turn.

70
00:03:11,498 --> 00:03:12,498
Screw you.

71
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:13,699
I want to shoot a duck.

72
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,500
Go get your own gun, then.

73
00:03:15,535 --> 00:03:17,302
At least give me a duck.

74
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:18,803
I fucking shot them.

75
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,371
It's my pool.

76
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,406
It's my dad's rifle.
You're an asshole.

77
00:03:22,441 --> 00:03:24,808
An asshole who's eating duck
for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

78
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,376
Yum!

79
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,577
Later.

80
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,879
Dick.

81
00:03:38,723 --> 00:03:40,457
Monica?

82
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:43,894
Mom?

83
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,598
You okay?

84
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,366
I'm tired.

85
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:57,075
Made you breakfast.

86
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,081
It's been a few days.

87
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,519
It's toast with peanut butter!

88
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:09,521
Got a few jelly packets

89
00:04:09,555 --> 00:04:10,889
from Leo's diner.

90
00:04:10,923 --> 00:04:13,425
I could get you one.

91
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:16,729
Mommy's not feeling
too good right now.

92
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,717
What else did Grammy buy you guys?

93
00:04:39,752 --> 00:04:43,220
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy,
got to sell everything.

94
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,556
She still won't
get out of her room.

95
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,757
I know what I want for Christmas.

96
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,559
I told you not to go up there.
Leave her alone.

97
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,994
Well, how's she gonna eat?
An AR-15 rifle.

98
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:53,296
She'll figure it out when
she gets hungry. And no one's

99
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:55,098
buying you a rifle.
Is something wrong with her?

100
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,901
She hasn't gotten out of bed in days.

101
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,269
Just what she does.

102
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:00,938
What is?
Little Hank

103
00:05:00,972 --> 00:05:02,940
has a rifle.
Little Hank's being raised by wolves.

104
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:04,942
Mom's bipolar, Debs.

105
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:06,310
Like the North and the South Pole?

106
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:08,279
Sort of.
Well, what can we do to help?

107
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,181
Not much. Just wait it out.

108
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,249
For how long?

109
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:12,283
Till she snaps out of it.

110
00:05:12,317 --> 00:05:13,251
Which she always does.

111
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:15,019
It just takes time.

112
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:16,187
I wish Lip were here.

113
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:18,256
You should call him.

114
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,858
He'll know what to do.
There's nothing to do, Debs.

115
00:05:20,892 --> 00:05:21,926
It is what it is.

116
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:26,464
Well...

117
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,299
I'll see if I can get her up.

118
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,201
Ian, don't...

119
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,207
Hey, Monica.

120
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:39,442
I want to go back to that bar tonight.

121
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:41,478
You know, the one you took me to?

122
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:46,549
Will you go with me?

123
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:50,154
Come on, it'll be fun.

124
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:51,588
You could wear that purple shirt.

125
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:56,127
Come on, Monica.

126
00:05:59,365 --> 00:06:01,066
Here, you want some coffee?

127
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,068
Mmm.

128
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:05,938
Honey, Mom needs to rest.

129
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:09,776
Please?

130
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,517
All right.

131
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,991
<i>Depression is hereditary.</i>

132
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:25,593
Holy shit!

133
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,060
Look up the 10/22

134
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,495
Ruger target tactical rifle.

135
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,431
Get away from me. You had
your turn all last night.

136
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:32,032
Geraldo, it's Fiona Gallaher.
Was just wondering if you...

137
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:33,100
Get away from me!

138
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:34,568
...have any extra
shifts available?

139
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,835
Did she get up?

140
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,937
Uh, hang on a sec, Geraldo.

141
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,272
Hey, I need you to take the pool
down-- there's homeless guy's

142
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:42,207
bathing in it again.
I can't. Got to get to work.

143
00:06:42,241 --> 00:06:44,109
Shit. Uh, sorry.

144
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:45,543
Anything would be great--
cleaning, front desk.

145
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:46,744
Whatever you got.

146
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:48,245
I think I'm depressed.

147
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,213
I've been feeling
kind of funky lately.

148
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:51,581
Means you're gonna
get your period soon.

149
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,182
It does?

150
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:55,118
Don't wear white for a while.

151
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:57,620
That sucks. All right, will you
keep my name on the list?

152
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:59,622
Thanks, Geraldo.
Hello, my tribe.

153
00:06:59,657 --> 00:07:01,724
Daddy! I'm gonna get
my period soon.

154
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,626
No time for that now, Debs.

155
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:04,761
I fixed the Buick!

156
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:06,429
It's good as new!

157
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,299
Is, uh... is
your mother upstairs?

158
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,968
Don't be getting her drunk-- it only
makes things worse. It says depression

159
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,270
is a symptom of menses.

160
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,305
Debs, wipe the memory on the computer.

161
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,907
Take it down to
Mr. Sam's Pawnshop.

162
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:20,410
See how much you can get for it.
What? No.

163
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:22,379
My X-box, too?
Everything.

164
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:24,381
Grammy bought us that stuff.
Yeah? Well, we have no money

165
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,883
since Monica stole the Squirrel Fund,

166
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:26,984
and we need to eat!

167
00:07:27,018 --> 00:07:29,486
Is Lip coming home

168
00:07:29,521 --> 00:07:30,654
for Thanksgiving tomorrow?

169
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,289
I don't know.

170
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:35,125
Now, go. And when you get back,
take the pool down

171
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,061
before it freezes and cracks.
I don't know how!

172
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,396
You'll figure it out;
it's not that hard.

173
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,897
Lip?

174
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,833
Go.

175
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,438
Monica, get up.

176
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:49,507
We're going on a road trip.

177
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:52,242
No. No.
We're gonna go see Clayton.

178
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:53,576
Moni...
No!

179
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,411
Back out of the rabbit hole.

180
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:57,447
Come on... up!

181
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,581
Up you go!

182
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,583
I need your help.
Remember,

183
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,585
I told you my mother mailed all
her money to my brothers

184
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,320
before she died?
Frank, leave me alone.

185
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,254
Well, that's ny money.

186
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,856
I deserve it.

187
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,591
I was with her on her death bed.

188
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,025
I paid the hospital bills

189
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,694
and made the funeral arrangements.

190
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,631
P.U.!

191
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,833
A little ripe there.
We better

192
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:19,867
get you in the shower.

193
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,101
No, Frank, please...

194
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,335
Honey, I need you to work

195
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,105
your feminine wiles on Clayton.

196
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,106
He's always had a woody for you.

197
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,144
What are you doing with her?

198
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,378
Getting her out of the house.

199
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:34,547
A little sunshine.
A little vitamin D.

200
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,551
She needs to go back on her meds.
I'm her husband.

201
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,753
I think I know what's best.

202
00:08:40,822 --> 00:08:42,156
Okay, you ready?

203
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,326
You can't lie down in the shower.

204
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,899
Also, you never use
toilet paper on your dick

205
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,802
after you take a piss.

206
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:56,238
You tap the end, let the
drops fall off, flush.

207
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,040
- That's very fatherly.
- Is that really? - Yeah.

208
00:08:58,074 --> 00:08:59,341
What you want to tell your kid?

209
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:00,576
Well, if it'll prevent him from

210
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,577
being heckled in the locker room

211
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,178
by other guys, absolutely.

212
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:04,813
Why'd the parents get you to make this

213
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,047
stupid video anyway?
Oh, they didn't.

214
00:09:06,082 --> 00:09:07,549
I thought of it on my own.

215
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,851
I wanted to give my son
some tools to survive.

216
00:09:09,886 --> 00:09:11,753
Hi. I'm Mandy.

217
00:09:11,787 --> 00:09:13,155
I'm not your real mom.

218
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,424
She didn't want anything
to do with you.

219
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,927
Look who's talking. Well, mine was barely a baby.
Like, eight cells or something.

220
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,996
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?

221
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,165
Hey, come on, we need to finish the video.
Wouldn't it be cool if

222
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,334
you're getting a blow job and talking
to your kid at the same time?

223
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:29,238
Yeah, I guess we can
finish the video later.

224
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,208
You know, this will be

225
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,444
the third time we've been together.
Mm-hmm.

226
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:36,912
Usually after the third
time, I either stop

227
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,281
or we have to figure it out.

228
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:40,082
Figure it out?
Yeah.

229
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,751
Like, what we're doing and stuff.

230
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,255
Well, I thought we
were just hanging out.

231
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,556
Maybe we should stop.

232
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:51,394
N-No, I don't
want to stop.

233
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,363
So, uh, we're gonna

234
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,432
figure it out and stuff?

235
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,567
Absolutely.

236
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,806
Yeah, coming.

237
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,078
Well, room service is getting hotter.

238
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,114
Is he here?

239
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:12,150
Uh, not at the moment,

240
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,151
but yes.
He's been here

241
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,887
for weeks now; why haven't you
kicked him out like I said?

242
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,223
Because I don't do everything you tell me to do.
Since when?

243
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,391
How am I supposed to trust you

244
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,659
if you don't keep your word?

245
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,127
I never said I would
kick him out; in fact,

246
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,829
I was doing you a favor
by letting him stay here.

247
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:26,997
Really? Because you're such
an upstanding citizen?

248
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:29,600
What do you have him
doing? Stealing cars?

249
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:30,901
Lip's a mess.
He's upset about Karen.

250
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,269
Drinking like a fish.

251
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,171
He'll be fine once he comes home.

252
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:37,975
Do you know anything
about teenage boys?

253
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,914
You can't give them ultimatums.

254
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,284
Marco!

255
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,119
Oh, my God.
Here soon!

256
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:48,953
We pick up!

257
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,088
Yo, Marco, Marco.

258
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:51,756
Uh, you are?

259
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,957
Okay, yeah, we'll be right there.

260
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:54,291
Just...

261
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:57,995
Oh, <i>hola,</i> Fiona.

262
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:04,369
Yeah.

263
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:07,839
Listen, here's the thing, Fiona.

264
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:10,542
I want to be with you,
but I'm not one of those kids

265
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:11,710
you can just boss around.

266
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:14,646
I'm sorry, now I got to go

267
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:15,814
pick up my wife's boyfriend.

268
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,358
How you doing there, Moni?

269
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,794
You hanging in?

270
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,062
Just think,

271
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:32,398
in a few hours we're gonna be rich.

272
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:35,368
How much you think
we can soak him for?

273
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:36,735
Once you turn on your charm,

274
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,071
we can get whatever
we want from Clayton.

275
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,376
I know my Monica.

276
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,144
Get anything from a man.

277
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:46,378
Hell,

278
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,314
you took my heart.

279
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,650
Ahmoney from Clayton will be easy.

280
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,418
I can't, Frank.

281
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,054
Of course you can.

282
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,489
Have a little faith.

283
00:11:56,523 --> 00:11:58,357
There is no God.

284
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,360
No, no, no, I'm saying.

285
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:01,995
Here.

286
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:03,764

Wouldn't trade me an iPad for a Ruger.

292

No one's gonna let
you have a gun, Carl.

293
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,647
Little Hank gets to have one.
Because his dad

294
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,916
hijacked a bunch of military cargo.

295
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,786
We got to empty the pool out, Conrad.

296
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,221
You guys got to get out of here.

297
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,456

into Tony's spigot

299
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,160
so we can siphon the water out.

300
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,728
Or we could just do it this way.

Sorry we ruined your bathtub, Conrad.

305
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,442
It's okay; Il go down

306
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:48,445
to the fountain in front of the Hyatt.

307
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,147
Hasn't frozen over yet.

308
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,183
Can't you just shower
at the free clinic?

309
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,417
I like baths.

310
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:55,853
A childhood thing.

311
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,155
Why the long face?

312
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,124
I think I have depression.

313
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,692
It's hereditary.

314
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,594
My mother has it.

315
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:07,364
Well, come here, have a seat.

Hey, why are we meeting him here?

319
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,146
Well, he's paranoid that customs
might've tailed him

320
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,914
once he finally got
out of the shipping container.

321
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:27,851

Frank.
Oh, Clayton.

349
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,347
Handsome as ever.

350
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,448
Why didn't you come by

351
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,450
to visit Mommy when she was dying,

352
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,051
Clayton?
Because I didn't even know

353
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,887
she was out of prison
until after she was dead.

354
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,522
I had to take care
of her all by myself.

355
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,391
I'm a little thirsty;
is the kitchen

356
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,692
in here?
Please, Monica,

357
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,028
don't...
Heard she sent you, Wyatt

358
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,363
and Jerry her money.

359
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,131
A few dollars, yeah.

360
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,432
Didn't leave me anything.

361
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,201
Is the wifey here?
No.

362
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,235
Work.

363
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,037
What was that?
Frank, what is she doing?

364
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,438
Seems to me it's only
fair that you and I

365
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,040
split the money, since I

366
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,608
looked after Mommy on her death bed.

367
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,810
Wow, I've always wanted
to try Veuve Clicquot.

368
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,646
Aw, we just bought
that for Thanksgiving!

369
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,548
Oh. Happy Holidays.

370
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,783
Okay, really.
You have to go now.

371
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,551
Not without my share of the money.
I'm sorry,

372
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,986
Frank, there's nothing
for me to give you.

373
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,087
Okay, the money's spent.

374
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,489
I used it to catch up on the mortgage.

375
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,558
Fine, be that way.

376
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:18,993
You don't want to give me any money,

377
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:21,496
let it rest
on your conscience, Clayton.

378
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,000
Now, I'm going to go to
the bathroom, and then

379
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,803
we will be out of your hair for good.

380
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,775
Long time, huh?

381
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,446
Come here, you.

382
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,115
Oh, Monica, don't do this.

383
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,249
Do what?

384
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,751
Get so close to me.

385
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:42,986
You mean like when we did

386
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,822
PCP at Comiskey Park
and sold T-shirts?

387
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,691
You were quite the ladies' man then.

388
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,527
I'm not gonna give you any money.

389
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,928
Well, you know Frank is not gonna

390
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,596
leave here without a couple thousands.

391
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,999
Oh, my God.
So, you might as well get your money's worth.

392
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,969
Monica, I-I can't.

393
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,203
I thought you couldn't resist me.

394
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,104
I'm sorry.

395
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,972
No, no, no.
No, I can't, I can't.

396
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:03,973
I-I'm married.

397
00:16:04,007 --> 00:16:06,541
I-I have kids.

398
00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,210
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go.

399
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,111
Yeah?
What?

400
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:12,146
What are you doing?

401
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,714
Sweetheart, no, you
can't lie down here.

402
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:15,716
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

403
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:17,118
What-what are you doing?
No, no, no, no.

404
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:18,986
You got to get up;
you can't lie down.

405
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,622
Honey, honey...
What did you do to her?

406
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,057
Nothing, we were just talking.

407
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:27,729
Hey, what's going on? Huh?

408
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,497
He didn't want me.

409
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,332
He didn't want me.

410
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,701
That's okay.

411
00:16:33,736 --> 00:16:35,736
I'm an ugly old hag.

412
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,005
That is not true.
Yeah.

413
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,974
No, you're beautiful.

414
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,810
Fuck.

415
00:16:41,844 --> 00:16:44,345
You are.

416
00:16:47,683 --> 00:16:48,750
I'm gonna take you home.

417
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,084
Okay? It's okay.

418
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,719
I'm not finished with you yet.

419
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,525
Are you hungry, Marco?

420
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,059
Yeah, I don't think he really gives a shit

421
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,327
about food right now.

422
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,361
All right.

423
00:17:07,201 --> 00:17:11,003
Probably right.

424
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,039
Your sister's driving
me crazy; I don't know

425
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,740
what it's gonna take
for her to trust me.

426
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,709
Again.
Can you blame her?

427
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,046
You know, you have
a whole other family.

428
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,582
First, your name was
Steve, then Jimmy.

429
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,417
You know, you disappear to Brazil.

430
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,553
Come back married.

431
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,522
You know, it's kind of a
tough way to build up trust.

432
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,391
I really am trustworthy, though.

433
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:32,227
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to
do something bold to prove it.

434
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,362
Oh, my pussy for you.

435
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:34,797
Yeah, babe, like that.

436
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:36,899
All right, dude, you got
to get me out of this car.

437
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,401
I'm getting too horned
out; pull over here?

438
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,471
Fuck.

439
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:46,240
You ready to go home yet?

440
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,442
Are you trying to get rid of me?

441
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,744
Just wondering.

442
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,646
No, you know what,
I think I'm done living at home.

443
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,981
I like being on my own.

444
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,582
And by being on your own
you mean sleeping

445
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,285
on my couch at the Ritz?

446
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,054
See ya.

447
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,059
Mm, yeah?
<i>Si, si!</i>

448
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,362
Don't worry, this isn't too weird.

449
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,465
♪ Make her booty bounce,
bounce, b-bounce, bounce ♪

450
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,368
♪ Make her booty bounce... ♪

451
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,839
So, what kind of
stuffing should we make?

452
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,408
I like the one with sausage in it.

453
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,642
Then sausage

454
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,010
we shall have.

455
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,478
Because I love you.
Thanks, Mom.

456
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,479
And I would never do anything

457
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,781
to upset you or to hurt you.

458
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,684
Okay.
At least not on purpose.

459
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,786
I know.

460
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,154
That's not to say

461
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:33,124
some urges might overtake me,

462
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,460
and cause me to think unclearly

463
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,629
and do things that I'm shamefully,

464
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,363
shamefully embarrassed about.

465
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,432
Is this about you sleeping with Jody?

466
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,768
What?

467
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,770
No.... Yes.

468
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:45,971
Maybe.

469
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,606
You know about that?
Yeah, Mom.

470
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,775
Honey, I'm so sorry.

471
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,010
I didn't mean to.

472
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,345
It was an accident.

473
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,513
An accident where

474
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,048
his penis slipped into your vagina?

475
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:57,784
Oh, God.
Hey.

476
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:58,651
Hey, what's going on?

477
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,886
My mom was just telling me

478
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,154
how she fucked Jody.
Oh.

479
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,022
Sweetheart!

480
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,523
It was not like that.

481
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:04,557
Way to go, Sheila.
Oh!

482
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,658
You know what, Mom?

483
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:06,826
I don't care.

484
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,828
In fact, I want you to screw him more.

485
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:10,296
Screw him all the time.

486
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,664
Take him, he's yours.

487
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,832
Get him off my back.

488
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,701
Jody, get in here!

489
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:22,842
He's coming in here? Now?

490
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,510
Hey, I need to talk to you.

491
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:25,711
Why? You fuck my mom, too?

492
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:26,979
Yeah, payback's a bitch.

493
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,148
Are you having the baby?
No.

494
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:30,382
Help her with the stuffing

495
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,251
or whatever it is that you guys do

496
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:33,686
together.
Oh, okay.

497
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,553
Hi.

498
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:36,188
Hi.

499
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:37,223
Jesus.

500
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:38,224
So, what do you want?

501
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,224
I was wondering if you, uh,

502
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,492
decided on a couple

503
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,060
to give the baby to yet.
Yup.

504
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:43,395
Mark and Celeste.

505
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:45,830
Why them?

506
00:19:45,865 --> 00:19:47,866
They gave me the most cash;
eight grand.

507
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,002
Okay, but I was thinking, um,
you know, maybe Jeff and Alana.

508
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:53,604
They only gave me, like, five.

509
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,172
Uh-huh, um,

510
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,040
right, but, uh,

511
00:19:56,074 --> 00:19:57,108
Jeff and Alana

512
00:19:57,142 --> 00:19:58,343
would be better parents.

513
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,878
Seems unfair they should get the kid

514
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:02,581
if Mark and Celeste paid more.

515
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:05,017
Fine, if you're gonna pout about
it, just give me your phone.

516
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:06,085
You're gonna call 'em now?

517
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,453
Might as well get it over with.

518
00:20:07,488 --> 00:20:09,456
I scheduled a
C-section for Friday.

519
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:10,858
What?
I want this thing out of me.

520
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:13,127
I can't wait two weeks.
Holy shit.

521
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:14,696
I'm gonna see
the little guy on Friday?

522
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,564
Yep, for, like, a second.

523
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,869
: Hi, Celeste,
it's Karen Jackson.

524
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,773
Yeah, I decided to keep the baby.

525
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,542
I can't give it away, I'm so sorry.

526
00:20:29,576 --> 00:20:31,210
Oh, thank you.

527
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:32,612
Yeah, you, too.

528
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:33,979
Bye.

529
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:38,017
Okay, where's the next number?

530
00:20:42,255 --> 00:20:43,222
Hi, Fiona.

531
00:20:43,256 --> 00:20:44,723
Hey, Debs, you're filthy.

532
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:45,991
Go take a shower.
Carl,

533
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,159
I took down half of the ol.

534
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,594
You have to do the rest.

535
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,095
Guess we're not having
turkey tomorrow.

536
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,731
Too expensive. Got to use
pawnshop money for the bills.

537
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,266
But it kind of looks like
a turkey, doesn't it?

538
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,434
Yeah, it's pretty good.

539
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:57,269
This smells good.
Hey,

540
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,005
I'm selling those to
Mrs. Campbell over on Western.

541
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,273
20 bucks a pop.

542
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:02,675
So I'm not worried
I have depression anymore.

543
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,911
Why, what happened?
Talked to my friend Conrad.

544
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,414
Says depression usually
skips a generation.

545
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,415
Conrad?

546
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,251
The homeless guy in our pool.

547
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,786
Okay.

548
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,954
And even if it doesn't
skip a generation,

549
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,523
it usually only runs
in 20% of the family.

550
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,926
One in five--
those are okay odds.

551
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,927
Way I figure it, it's going to be Lip.

552
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,195
He's halfway there as it is.

553
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,863
Probably shouldn't have
kicked him out.

554
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:31,003
It's Lip. Don't be a douche,
leave a message.

555
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:34,139
Hope you know you're invited
for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

556
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,307
Call me.

557
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:37,309
Love you.

558
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:41,480
Message deleted.

559
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,888
- We hope you enjoy your stay
with us at the Ritz-Carlton. - Jesus,

560
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:48,989
what are you, an old man?!

561
00:21:49,024 --> 00:21:50,725
We're sure that our five-star...

562
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:56,665
Holy shit...
they're still fucking?

563
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:58,800
Sometimes it's fighting. Can't
really tell the difference.

564
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,405
Our hotel...

565
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:05,740
Wow.

566
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,642
Don't be rubbing your apple in there.

567
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,310
I can't listen to it from both sides.

568
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,260
Okay.

569
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:30,195
Hey, little guy.

570
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,731
Uh, I think I'm going to end this now

571
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,934
'cause you're coming
into the world on Friday.

572
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:38,036
I hope I get to hang out
with you for a few minutes

573
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,605
before we hand you over
to your new parents.

574
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,940
I think they're really going
to take very good care of you.

575
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,443
<i>You know, I wish</i>
<i>it could have been us.</i>

576
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,545
But, um...

577
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:51,014
well, things are pretty messed up

578
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:53,683
around here, so...

579
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,618
Um...
<i>You ever want</i>

580
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:59,688
to get in touch with me, though,
that, that would be cool.

581
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:04,260
You know, just, uh, just look
for this ugly mug.

582
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,065
You know, I'll be around.

583
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,970
I'm not going anywhere.

584
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,808
All right, take it easy, buddy.

585
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,289
English.
Marco, what's going on?

586
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,963
Wait, doesn't that fucking hu?

587
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:43,265
What?

588
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,400
Nothing.
Uh, Lip, what are they saying?

589
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:46,468
I think he's probably pissed

590
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:47,936
because you fucked Estefania?

591
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:49,938
You fucked Estefania, too?
No, no, no.

592
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:51,073
He fucked Estefania.

593
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:52,507
Because we were married!

594
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,809
Estefania, get my gun.

595
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:55,310
He just told her to get his gun.

596
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:56,978
I know, he said it in English.

597
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,547
No, <i>amor,</i> no.
Listen to her, Marco.

598
00:24:01,617 --> 00:24:04,085
Uh, uh, wait, wait, wait,

599
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,820
w-wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

600
00:24:05,855 --> 00:24:08,189
Marco, you look like a reasonable man.

601
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:10,457
We can work this out.
<i>Como?</i>

602
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:11,592
How, man?

603
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,760
Uh, Lip,

604
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:14,127
go to my bag.
Yep, okay.

605
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,096
Get my, uh, I.D.

606
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:18,265
and passport.

607
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:19,866
Give it to Marco.

608
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:23,938
Marco, you're me now.
Take my identity, yeah.

609
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,339
It's your fucking picture here, man.

610
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:26,774
Little plastic surgery,

611
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:28,543
new haircut, you'll be golden.

612
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:29,978
Yeah, I definitely see a resemblance.

613
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,713
And if Este's dad comes
looking for you, Marco,

614
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:33,882
she'll still be married to Steve
Wilton, the two of you will be safe.

615
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:34,983
That sounds like a foolproof plan.

616
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,618
We good?

617
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:38,820
Yeah.

618
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:40,221
I never want to see you again.

619
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,222
Yeah, not a problem.
Now, man.

620
00:24:43,425 --> 00:24:45,460
The fuck you looking at, man?

621
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:47,062
Out, out!
Sure, yeah, right.

622
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:48,063
I'm-- just got to...

623
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:49,131
Okay.

624
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:51,967
What the hell was that?

625
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,035
You told me to do something bold.

What are you waiting for?
You want to go inside?

635
00:25:47,556 --> 00:25:49,957
Come on.

636
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:52,259
Roger, he's with us.

637
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:53,693
I like my men red.

638
00:25:53,728 --> 00:25:55,562
I'm gonna call you Ginger.

639
00:25:57,631 --> 00:25:58,898
I'm so sorry, Frank.

640
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:01,935
It's okay, Moni, it's okay.

641
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:04,070
You, you don't have
to keep apologizing.

642
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,071
But I've ruined everything.

643
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:09,108
No, we'll get the money
from Clayton some other time.

644
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:17,350
Here, just...

645
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,253
Everything's...

646
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,257
Everything's gonna be fine.

647
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,660
You want a beer?

648
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,262
I'm not thirsty.

649
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,564
No one drinks beer
because they're thirsty.

650
00:26:30,598 --> 00:26:34,502
I got two more brothers
we can get money from.

651
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,004
Jerry's weak.

652
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:38,072
He'll roll over quick.

653

Monica?

00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:48,851
Monica.

656
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:51,254
Monica?

657
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:58,194
What are you doing under the stairs?

658
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:01,164
Come on, come on now,
get out from there.

659
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,101
Monica, let's go upstairs.

660
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:07,370

Sweeplace you got.

673
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:29,420
Yeah, we have company condos
all over the country.

674
00:28:29,455 --> 00:28:32,023
Hmm, what do you do?

675
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:33,524
Real estate.

676
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,592
I live in Miami.

677
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:37,362
Hmm.

678
00:28:37,396 --> 00:28:40,531
You mind if I, uh,
sleep here for the night?

679
00:28:40,566 --> 00:28:41,900
What, you don't like it at home?

680
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:47,505
Well, hey, that's
no problem for me, huh?

681
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,242
We can go r round three, huh?

682
00:28:50,276 --> 00:28:51,877
Come on.

683
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:53,612
Get it.
I can take you, brother.

684
00:28:56,516 --> 00:28:58,417
All right!

685
00:28:58,451 --> 00:28:59,618
I'm coming.

686
00:28:59,652 --> 00:29:01,320
Who forgot their keys?

687
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,057
I kicked Lip out.

688
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:07,159
Where'd he go?
I don't know.

689
00:29:07,193 --> 00:29:08,393
You don't know?
You didn't ask me to find out

690
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:10,061
where he was going.
You asked me to kick him out.

691
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:12,330
You're right, I'm sorry.

692
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:28,281
Thank you.
You're welcome.

693
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:29,583
How'd he take it?

694
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:30,684
Seemed fine.
You want to go upstairs?

695
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:32,820
No, you got a thank-you kiss.

696
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,821
That's it?

697
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,422
What were you expecting?

698
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:37,257
Can I spend the night on your couch?

699
00:29:37,292 --> 00:29:40,126
Why?
Then I'll be here tomorrow for Thanksgiving.

700
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,127
Who said you're invited?

701
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:42,295
I kicked Lip out.

702
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:44,497
I'll get you a pillow and blanket.

703
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,855
Hey.

704
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:10,390
Missed me, huh?

705
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,158
Yeah. Um, hey, look,

706
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:14,661
is it... is it all right
if I stay over tonight?

707
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,631
Couldn't go 12 hours
without seeing me, could ya?

708
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:36,082
I shot a duck!

709
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:37,917
I shot a duck!

710
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:42,789
That's no duck.

711
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:47,661
That's a bald eagle.

712
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,570
Happy Thanksgiving.

713
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,205
Morning, Steve.

714
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,607
You know what, Debs?
Let's make it official.

715
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,575
No more Steve.
From now on, it's Jimmy.

716
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,843
Okay. Cool.

717
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:05,812
Really?
Yup.

718
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:08,548
To Jimmy!

719
00:31:08,582 --> 00:31:09,382
To Jimmy!
Jimmy!

720
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:11,551
Cheers.
Cheers.

721
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,353
You know, I'm gonna call you
Jimmy pillow drooler.

722
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:15,555
Shut the fuck up.
I do not.

723
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:18,358
No, I swear to God.
This is you.

724
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:24,730
What are you doing over there?
What's it look like?

725
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:25,865
Plucking a bald eagle.
What?

726
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,934
Carl shot it in the yard.

727
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:30,570
With what?
That's against the law.

728
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,439
I already gave him a lecture.
And took out the bullets.

729
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,408
It says there was
a re-release program

730
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,542
in the Michigan peninsula.

731
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,643
Let out ten bald eagles

732
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,978
that had been raised

733
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:39,379
in the Detroit Zoo into the wild.

734
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,447
And one of them came to me last night.

735
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,884
You know, there is something on his leg.
That's a tracking device.

736
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,285
That way, they can
monitor where it nests.

737
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,454
So, somebody knows that we have it?
Probably.

738
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,589
Uh, it must have hurt, huh, buddy?

739
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,091
Got him on my first shot.

740
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,759
Says tampering with a bald eagle

741
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:53,594
tracker is

742
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,129
punishable by law.

743
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,831
Problem solved.

744
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,299
Here, Carl, get rid of the evidence.

745
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,068
Eww!

746
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:01,936
Guess we can save this
for the weekend.

747
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,772
Why? What are we having
for Thanksgiving?

748
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,310
No, no, no, no, no. No.

749
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:11,647
It's just like the pilgrims intended.

750
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,018
Happy Thanksgiving.

751
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,452
Hmm.

752
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:19,120
Oh.

753
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,522
Stop it.

754
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,292
I'm not in the mood.

755
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,327
You're always in the mood.

756
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,296
How about a little handy J?

757
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,966
You don't have to do anything.

758
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,168
I'll do all the work.

759
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:36,172
That's a girl.

760
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:42,613
Moni, you got to squeeze a little.

761
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,728
Mm.

762
00:32:56,762 --> 00:33:00,165
Time for you to go back
on your meds, huh?

763
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,870
Yeah.

764
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:07,339
Okay.

765
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:10,543
I'll get you some.

766
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:21,855
When should we tell Ian?

767
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:24,524
Tell him what?

768
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:25,891
About us?

769
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:30,929
Yo.
Get the hell out!

770
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,030
What, are you
Gallagher hopping, Mandy?

771
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:32,764
Dad said you had to knock

772
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,199
before you came in.

773
00:33:34,234 --> 00:33:35,667
Need someone to do a beer run.

774
00:33:35,702 --> 00:33:36,602
Yeah, just 'cause you two retards

775
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:38,004
have DUIs don't make me

776
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:39,405
your personal chauffeur.

777
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,439
No, I'll do it.
Yeah, cool.

778
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:42,108
Yeah.
Thanks.

779
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:43,542
We can go get breakfast
burritos at Juan's truck after.

780
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:51,718
- I didn't know you could do that with
a turkey baster. - Oh, honey...

781
00:33:51,752 --> 00:33:53,353
Frank.

782
00:33:53,387 --> 00:33:55,689
Sheila.
What are you doing here?

783
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:58,726
I came by to wish you...
happy Thanksgiving!

784
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,528
Happy Thanksgiving, Frank.

785
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:02,964
What the hell is he doing here?

786
00:34:02,998 --> 00:34:04,599
Where have you been?

787
00:34:04,633 --> 00:34:06,234
Oh, Sheils.

788
00:34:06,268 --> 00:34:09,270
I... I really didn't want
to have to tell you this.

789
00:34:09,305 --> 00:34:10,739
What? That
Monica's back?

790
00:34:10,773 --> 00:34:12,306
You heard about that?

791
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,042
Yes.
Oh.

792
00:34:14,076 --> 00:34:15,910
Are you... are you mad?

793
00:34:15,944 --> 00:34:18,212
- I'm not, actually.
- Yeah.

794
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:19,314
Mom fucked my ex.

795
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,782
You slept with Lip?

796
00:34:20,816 --> 00:34:22,884
Oh, God, no.
It was me.

797
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:24,753
You slept with him?
Yes.

798
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:26,922
Yes, I did.

799
00:34:28,958 --> 00:34:30,659
Oh, my God!

800
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,227
Sheila!

801
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:34,063
How could you do this to me?

802
00:34:34,097 --> 00:34:37,266
My heart-- it's broken.

803
00:34:37,301 --> 00:34:41,103
I'm probably gonna go through
a lot of depression over this.

804
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh, God. Could use
some antidepressants.

805
00:34:44,474 --> 00:34:46,074
Lithium... if you've got it?

806
00:34:46,109 --> 00:34:48,611
All right, okay, Frank.
God!

807
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:49,778
Frank, please don't be
upset with Sheila.

808
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,113
It's my fault.

809
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:53,815
Shit! Fuck! Cock!

810
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,451
Did I just piss myself?

811
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,620
It's the baby.

812
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,522
Oh!
Honey, you're gonna have the baby!

813
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,090
I'll go get your suitcase.
Oh, my God!

814
00:35:02,124 --> 00:35:03,658
I'm gonna be a grandma.

815
00:35:03,693 --> 00:35:05,794
Yeah, I know.
This is exciting!

816
00:35:05,828 --> 00:35:07,629
Hey.

817
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:09,965
I got your suitcase!
I got your suitcase!

818
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:12,267
Okay, okay.
Sweetie...

819
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,039
Somebody get some towels or something.

820
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,610
We'll be right back.

821
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:23,745
Want anything?
Uh...Too bad.

822
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:28,716
What should we do this weekend?

823
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,119
Karen's actually
having the baby tomorrow.

824
00:35:31,153 --> 00:35:32,487
So...
Whatime?

825
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:34,390
Want to see a movie after?

826
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,992
I-I guess?

827
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,828
Okay, cool.
Whoa. Mandy, come on.

828
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:42,064
Your brothers are right there.
I'll be fast.

829
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,499
Seriously. They're, like,
20 feet away. Come on.

830
00:35:44,534 --> 00:35:46,635
What the fuck?!

831
00:35:46,669 --> 00:35:48,970
Open the fucking register!
Let's go! Let's go!

832
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,372
Mandy, I thought you said
they were getting beer.

833
00:35:50,406 --> 00:35:52,374
A euphemism.

834
00:35:52,408 --> 00:35:54,142
Come on, old man!
Let's go! Pick it all up!

835
00:35:56,179 --> 00:35:58,479
Jesus!

836
00:35:58,514 --> 00:35:59,981
Shit!

837
00:36:02,084 --> 00:36:03,485
Where the hell are you going?!

838
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,253
We got to get out of here!

839
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,354
Get back in the car!

840
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,790
Got to get out.
No fucking way!

841
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,862
You're gonna fuck me and walk away?

842
00:36:14,897 --> 00:36:16,263
Fuck you!

843
00:36:17,732 --> 00:36:19,233
Asshole, Lip! Eat shit.

844
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:23,403
Mandy!

845
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:33,712
Hello?

846
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,247
Wait. She is?

847
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:37,015
Oh, my God.

848
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,550
All right, the baby, yeah.

849
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:40,085
Um...

850
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:41,853
All right, all right,
I'll be right there.

851
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:49,528
Didn't take much stuffing.

852
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,230
How long we supposed to cook it for?

853
00:36:51,264 --> 00:36:52,932
20 minut a pound for turkey.

854
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:58,104
We are not having bald
eagle for Thanksgiving. Here.

855
00:36:58,138 --> 00:37:01,807
Whoa, this thing's huge.
You're welcome, Tiny Tim.

856
00:37:01,842 --> 00:37:03,542
What are we supposed to do with this?
Toss it?

857
00:37:03,577 --> 00:37:06,745
Hell, no. Hunt it, kill it,
eat it. The hunter's code.

858
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,749
There's no way we're gonna
let the most sacred symbol of

859
00:37:09,783 --> 00:37:12,919
American freedom and individual
liberty go to waste.

860
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:15,355
I'll put it in the freezer.

861
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:19,626
We got Thanksgiving!

862
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:27,268
Christ Almighty,
this cock sucker's killing me.

863
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:30,939
Oh, my gosh, it's so exciting.
I can hardly contain myself.

864
00:37:32,608 --> 00:37:35,177
Mom, I'm supposed
to be the one breathing.

865
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,812
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I'm just so excited and nervous.

866
00:37:36,846 --> 00:37:39,081
And out of the house.

867
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,818
Damn, that thing really opens up.

868
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:43,353
Get the hell away from me.

869
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,654
Sorry.

870
00:37:44,689 --> 00:37:46,857
Mother fucking piece of shit!

871
00:37:47,992 --> 00:37:50,927
We got a big turkey.
We got a big turkey.

872
00:37:50,962 --> 00:37:53,531
Where have you been?

873
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:54,898
Out.
Did you come home last night?

874
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:58,535
No.
You even think to call?

875
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,205
I'm here now.

876
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,006
Wasn't gonna miss a family holiday.

877
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:06,576
Come here.

878
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:12,781
Happy Thanksgiving.

879
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:15,383
It's a nice hickey.
Go wash up.

880
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,954
Should I set a place for Lip?
Sure, sweetie.

881
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:21,623
You better not have started without me.
Frank?

882
00:38:21,657 --> 00:38:23,024
Hey!
Daddy!

883
00:38:23,058 --> 00:38:23,791
You're gonna come to dinner?

884
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:24,959
Of course I am, son.

885
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:25,993
And so's your mother.

886
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,228
Lithium?
Moni,

887
00:38:28,263 --> 00:38:29,897
I got your medications.

888
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,299
Mom's under the stairs?

889
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:33,666
How long has she been under there?

890
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:36,103
Here you go, sweetheart.
Here's your candy.

891
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:40,808
That should do it.

892
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:42,743
Get out of there.

893
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,679
Get out of there.
No, Fiona.

894
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,313
No, Fiona! No!

895
00:38:46,348 --> 00:38:47,815
Come on out. Come on.

896
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:49,317
No!
Get out of there.

897
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:50,985
Come on.
No!

898
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,320
Come on.
Fiona.

899
00:38:52,354 --> 00:38:54,189
Up you go.
Up you go. Come on.

900
00:38:54,223 --> 00:38:56,691
I look a mess.
No, you do not.

901
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:59,527
You look beautiful. Doesn't
she look beautiful, kids?

902
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:00,662
You look great.

903
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:02,330
Yeah.
Yeah. Hi, Mom.

904
00:39:02,365 --> 00:39:04,532
You're not spending Thanksgiving
under the stairs, okay?

905
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,001
Debs, set a place for Monica.

906
00:39:06,035 --> 00:39:07,269
We're all having dinner together.

907
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,737
With the kids at the table.

908
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:10,038
That's right.

909
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:11,273
You're gonna sit right here.

910
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,842
Well, then, happy Thanksgiving.

911
00:39:13,876 --> 00:39:16,110
Happy Thanksgiving!

912
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,879
Who's hungry? I...
Yeah.

913
00:39:21,583 --> 00:39:24,186
Sorry. Hi, Jeff. Alana.

914
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,554
Hey.
Sheila called us.

915
00:39:25,588 --> 00:39:27,289
Can't believe it's happening so fast.

916
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:28,724
I don't, either.
You guys coming in?

917
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:29,725
Karen didn't want us in there.

918
00:39:29,759 --> 00:39:30,693
They told us to wait out here.

919
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:31,694
Okay.

920
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:32,728
She's in room 803.

921
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:33,762
Right. Oh, hey, um,

922
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:34,930
I wanted to give you guys something.

923
00:39:34,964 --> 00:39:37,867
Uh, made this for the baby.

924
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:42,406
Um, if you guys could give it
to him at some point,

925
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,575
you know, if you feel like it.

926
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,043
Yeah. Thank you, Lip.

927
00:39:46,078 --> 00:39:48,146
Yeah, we will.

928
00:39:48,181 --> 00:39:50,549
Cool. Um, I should go in.

929
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:53,552
Go!

930
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,254
Here we go!

931
00:39:56,957 --> 00:39:58,625
Good job, baby.

932
00:39:58,659 --> 00:40:00,093
Can't wait to get that turkey in me.

933
00:40:00,127 --> 00:40:02,161
You okay?

934
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:04,931
Ah! We haven't said grace yet.

935
00:40:04,965 --> 00:40:06,732
I'll say it.
I'll say the grace.

936
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:07,901
Hold hands.

937
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:09,402
Dear Lord,

938
00:40:09,437 --> 00:40:11,838
Thank you for this food
that we're about to eat.

939
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,741
Thank you for bringing my Monica

940
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,243
back to me.

941
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:18,913
And please make my brother
Clayton burn in hell

942
00:40:18,948 --> 00:40:20,482
for all eternity when the time comes.

943
00:40:20,517 --> 00:40:22,585
Amen.

944
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,988
Amen.

945
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,539
Are you gonna carve the turkey?
I'm starving.

946
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,973
I'm carving.
I am the man of the house.

947
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,613
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

948
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,948
Fiona, is Lip coming?

949
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:52,815
Want me to call him?

950
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,716
Yeah.
Uh,

951
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,017
he knows what time we're eating.

952
00:40:55,051 --> 00:40:56,285
Mashed potatoes, please.

953
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,988
Who likes dark meat?
Me!

954
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:00,823
Ooh, me, too.
And on my turkey, also.

955
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,361
I invited Conrad. Is that okay?

956
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:06,496
Conrad?

957
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,664
My homeless guy from the pool.

958
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,899
Coming...
Sure, Debs.

959
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,300
Conrad, how are you?

960
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:11,835
Hi, Deb.
Hi.

961
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,471
Everyone, this is Conrad.

962
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:17,206
Hi, Conrad.

963
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:20,143
Much better than bald eagle.

964
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:23,313
Hey, we're still eating that.

965
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:25,014
We're gonna roast it, bake it, fry it.

966
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,182
I don't care,
but we're really gonna eat it.

967
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,417
Bet it tastes like chicken.

968
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,851
Well, we could always
have it for Christmas.

969
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:32,689
What was that?

970
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,424
I'm just gonna put all of this

971
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,058
on this one plate,
and then everybody could...

972
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,394
Holy fuck!

973
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:40,730
What?

974
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,332
Give me a phone.

975
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,167
Give me a phone.

976
00:41:48,705 --> 00:41:50,272
Come on, guys, upstairs.
Upstairs, kids.

977
00:41:50,306 --> 00:41:52,340
Okay, uh, fuck!

978
00:41:52,374 --> 00:41:54,209
We're good. We're good.
We're good. Don't worry.

979
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:57,679
More towels.

980
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:00,616
- Shit!
- There's been an accident.

981
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,950
All right.

982
00:42:01,985 --> 00:42:03,552
2119 North Wallace.

983
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:04,887
She's bleeding badly.

984
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:05,721
Yeah, she's awake.
Uh...

985
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:07,056
Frank, more towels!

986
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:09,592
Towels! Will somebody
give me a fucking towel?

987
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,731
Frank, they want to know
if she took any pills.

988
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:17,401
Dad! Dad?!

989
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:18,469
You're good.
I'm not sure.

990
00:42:20,472 --> 00:42:21,439
Can you see me?
Can you see me?

991
00:42:21,473 --> 00:42:24,109
Help me with her feet,
Frank. Frank?

992
00:42:24,143 --> 00:42:25,310
Get... Get over here!

993
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:27,280
You with me?
You with me? Breathe.

994
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,249
You're gonna be good, okay?
Slow, slow. You're gonna

995
00:42:30,284 --> 00:42:32,618
be good. It's just... It's fine.
You're fine. You're fine.

996
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,274
Why didn't Frank come?

997
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:59,445
I don't know, Debs.

998
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:01,247
Holy fuck.
Dude, if you say that

999
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,349
one more time, I'm gonna throw
you in the oven with that

1000
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:05,284
turkey when we get home, okay?
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

1001
00:43:05,318 --> 00:43:06,485
You try Lip again?

1002
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,753
Yeah, just left a message.

1003
00:43:07,788 --> 00:43:08,754
Miss Gallagher?

1004
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:11,490
Debs, stay with me.

1005
00:43:11,525 --> 00:43:12,658
How is she?

1006
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,794
She's stable.
Oh, thank God.

1007
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,696
We're gonna hold her for 72
hours, make sure she doesn't try

1008
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:18,165
to harm herself again.

1009
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:19,466
She's bipolar?

1010
00:43:19,501 --> 00:43:20,935
Okay, we'll get her back

1011
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,838
on her meds and leveled out.
Can we see her?

1012
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:25,539
No, not right now.
She's heavily sedated.

1013
00:43:25,574 --> 00:43:27,975
You should go
home. Excuse me.

1014
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:33,314
You okay?

1015
00:43:33,348 --> 00:43:35,816
Lip just called.
He's coming?

1016
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,785
Karen's having her baby upstairs.

1017
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:39,186
Holy fuck!

1018
00:43:40,655 --> 00:43:43,823
Is Maternity this way?
I'm gonna be an aunt!

1019
00:43:43,857 --> 00:43:46,892
I'm gonna have a nephew I can beat up.

1020
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,861
Why can't I just get a C-section?

1021
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:52,030
You're too far along, sweetie.

1022
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:54,332
- Sometimes Mother Nature has
other plans, honey. - Fuck Mother Nature!

1023
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:57,368
- She doesn't have to worry about her vagina
getting stretched. - Ow!

1024
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,636
You were already

1025
00:43:58,671 --> 00:43:59,905
pretty stretched out
down there, Karen.

1026
00:43:59,939 --> 00:44:01,406
I want drugs!
Give me drugs!

1027
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,709
Sweetie, push!
You're almost there. Push!

1028
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:06,378
I am pushing, bitch.
Oh, I can see his head.

1029
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:09,548
Oh, my God, the miracle
of birth, sweetie!

1030
00:44:09,582 --> 00:44:11,750
It's so beautiful.

1031
00:44:11,784 --> 00:44:14,018
More visitors.

1032
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:15,420
Hey, sweetheart!

1033
00:44:15,454 --> 00:44:16,755
Oh, the Gallaghers!

1034
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:19,557
It's a party!

1035
00:44:20,526 --> 00:44:21,726
I'm gonna be a grandma!

1036
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,562
Great. Let's just have the whole
Fighting Illini

1037
00:44:24,597 --> 00:44:27,065
marching band in while we're at it!

1038
00:44:27,099 --> 00:44:28,366
Lip!

1039
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:30,869
Look, my baby boy's come out.

1040
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,503
Ew.

1041
00:44:32,538 --> 00:44:34,038
Vagina.

1042
00:44:34,073 --> 00:44:36,240
Sorry we didn't have time
to buy you any cigars, man.

1043
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:37,709
Oh, no worries, man.

1044
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:40,244
That's right, all you guys just
fucking whoop it up

1045
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:42,847
while I'm sitting in here!
Fucking fuck!

1046
00:44:42,882 --> 00:44:45,117
Okay, it's coming.
It's coming. It's coming!

1047
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:48,888
Breathe, Karen.

1048
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,357
You keep breathing, fuck nut!

1049
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,892
Shit, I don't know if I ever
wanna do this now.

1050
00:44:52,927 --> 00:44:54,127
One more big push, Karen.

1051
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,650
Um, Doctor?

1052
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:21,655
What's going on?

1053
00:45:23,384 --> 00:45:26,593
Is he okay?

1054
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:29,796
Oh, no.

1055
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:31,197
That thing looks weird.

1056
00:45:32,766 --> 00:45:35,134
I think he looks beautiful.

1057
00:45:38,806 --> 00:45:40,140
What's wrong with him?

1058
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,411
He has Down Syndrome, Debs.

1059
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:45,769
Yeah, and he's Asian.

1060
00:45:45,889 --> 00:45:48,783
Maybe we're just looking at him
upside down.

1061
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,948
Here you go, honey,
you can hold him now.

1062
00:45:59,068 --> 00:46:00,628
No, no, I don't want to touch him.

1063
00:46:00,663 --> 00:46:03,131
You should hold him
and say good-bye.

1064
00:46:03,165 --> 00:46:04,532
Just take him away.

1065
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:06,968
What the fuck, Karen,

1066
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:09,170
I thought you said it was mine?!

1067
00:46:09,205 --> 00:46:12,140
I screwed Timmy Wong
as much as I screwed you.

1068
00:46:12,174 --> 00:46:15,209
I never said it was your baby.

1069
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:18,145
You just wanted it to be.

1070
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:25,885
Go tell Jeff and Alana to come
