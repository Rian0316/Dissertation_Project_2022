1
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,640
<i> Belinda Carlisle there with one</i>
<i>of the biggest hits of 1987 so far.</i>

2
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>Gotta love that track!
Coming up next in just a moment...</i>

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,960
Could you please stop it?
I just wanna have some fun, okay?

4
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,120
Kelly, come on.

5
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,640
- Kelly.
- I'm still walking, Wes.

6
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,880
We've only got a couple of hours
so let's, uh... let's use it.

7
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
I am using it.

8
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey.

9
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
You're good at this.

10
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,000
It's, uh... got different endings.

11
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,160
Depending on if you're in one
or two player.

12
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,360
Uh-huh?

13
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,960
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

14
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Do you wanna play <i>Top Speed</i>?

15
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Oh, no.

16
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,720
Thank you.
I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

17
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,960
Uh... okay.

18
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,840
- See you around?
- Mm-hmm.

19
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,000
Go along with whatever I say.

20
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,600
- Sorry?
- Whatever I say, go along with it.

21
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,880
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

22
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,880
- Do I have to red light you?
- Two hours 35.

23
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
- There's not much time left.
- Wes.

24
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Look...

25
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,960
- Last week, we had the most amazing...
- Last week was last week.

26
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,600
I need to talk with my friend here, okay?
Haven't seen her in a while.

27
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,280
Wes, she's sick.

28
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
Like "six months to live" sick.

29
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,480
Five, actually.

30
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,360
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.

31
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Okay.

32
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Okay.

33
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,120
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

34
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,680
See you around?

35
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,400
Sure.

36
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,560
Sorry for killing you.

37
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,600
The whole "six months to live" thing?

38
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,440
Sorry. Five.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Five was a nice touch.

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,480
- Kelly.
- Yorkie.

41
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,040
- Yurgie?
- Yorkie.

42
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,960
Like the dog breed?

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Yeah.

44
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,920
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,400
- Met him at the Quagmire so...
- What's the Quagmire?

46
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,360
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is,

47
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,400
you probably don't wanna know.

48
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
No?

49
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,680
You want another one?

50
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
- Oh, no, I...
- Yeah, you do. Come on.

51
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,320
Do I have to tug your leash?

52
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,280
- Hey, Blondie.
- I'm Blondie?

53
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,640
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

54
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,880
- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
- Times two.

55
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,280
- What are you doing?
- I'm... regarding you.

56
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,720
I feel like I'm being analysed.

57
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,640
- Why the glasses?
- Um...

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,040
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

59
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,800
- Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
- Knew it!

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
I used to wear them in school.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,400
So I guess now
they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

62
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,880
I figured they were
kind of a fashion statement.

63
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,400
- Really?
- But then the rest of your outfit is not.

64
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,320
Don't take that wrong.
It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

65
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,640
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

66
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,560
They probably saw it in some movie.

67
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,440
But I like these.

68
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,800
You're authentically you.

69
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Thanks.

70
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Cheers.

71
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
You never tasted it before?

72
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,760
No, I...

73
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,560
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

74
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
Do you live here?

75
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,040
- No. Oh, uh...
- Tourist?

76
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,480
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

77
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,360
- First night.
- First night? Wow, okay!

78
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,400
Oh, my God!

79
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,160
We<i> have</i> to dance to this.

80
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
- With each other?
- Uh-huh.

81
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,040
- Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.
- Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

82
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,400
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can, come on.

83
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,360
- No, I'll look dumb...
- Just follow my lead!

84
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,840
Copy me.

85
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
You got it.

86
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Hey!

87
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,520
- Why did you run away?
- Oh, sorry.

88
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,000
I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

89
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,120
No shit.

90
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,880
Like a frightened horse
on a frozen lake back there.

91
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

92
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,160
Sorry I pushed you into it.

93
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,560
Saturday nights once a week.
It's like no time. I get impatient.

94
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,520
No, no, it's not that. It's...

95
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,000
- Everyone was looking.
- Looking?

96
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,800
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

97
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Okay, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,680
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

99
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,440
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

100
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,160
- You're stupid.
- Thank you!

101
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,160
- I've never been on a dance floor.
- Never?

102
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,320
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

103
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,360
Never.

104
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,320
What are you, like, Amish?

105
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,600
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

106
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
Yeah, well.

107
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,600
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

108
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,120
Well, no one knows
about even half the shit I get up to.

109
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,920
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

110
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,680
- They worry.
- They don't worry.

111
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

112
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,040
What would you like to do?
That you've never done?

113
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh...

114
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,160
So many things.

115
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,240
San Junipero is a party town.

116
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,600
All up for grabs.

117
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,120
Midnight's two hours away.

118
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,800
Oh, that's not long.

119
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,440
Why waste time sitting here?

120
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
I, um...

121
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
- Listen...
- It's okay.

122
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,560
- No, I mean...
- Really, it's okay.

123
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,520
No, I'm, uh...
I'm engaged. I have a fiancé.

124
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,240
- He's called Greg.
- And is Greg here?

125
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,880
- No, he's...
- Elsewhere?

126
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah.

127
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,520
Oh.

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
Wanna go to bed with me?

129
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,760
We could be back at mine in like...

130
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,400
I never did anything like that.

131
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,840
All the more reason.

132
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
Oh, you're nice.

133
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,520
- I can't.
- Okay.

134
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,320
- I just... I can't.
- I get it.

135
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,440
- I have to go.
- In this?

136
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,480
It's been really great to meet you.

137
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Likewise.

138
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay.

139
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,480
Okay.

140
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Okay.

141
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,440
Shit.

142
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,480
- What the hell, Wes?
- Look, I know I'm coming across...

143
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,280
- I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
- No, don't do that. Just...

144
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,000
- Then stop this.
- Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

145
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
How many girls do you think there are
in San Junipero?

146
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,240
Hundreds? Thousands?

147
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,360
I don't care.

148
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

149
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,440
The locals? They're like dead people.

150
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,600
A little lively for dead people.

151
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,280
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, okay?

152
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,160
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

153
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,680
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

154
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,120
- Hang out at the Quagmire again.
- It's not just sex.

155
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
- It was just sex.
- No, we made a connection.

156
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,080
Wes, it was just sex.

157
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,400
- No...
- No roots.

158
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,760
We had fun.

159
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,640
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

161
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

162
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,760
Waiting for someone?

163
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,520
Not really.

164
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,640
I'll get you a drink?

165
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
Uh, yeah, sure.

166
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,840
So, uh... yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

167
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,720
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

168
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,040
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

169
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,200
- Shall we dance?
- Sure.

170
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,560
I mean, I guess by the time
I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

171
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,120
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

172
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Gotta use the bathroom.

173
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,360
Okay.

174
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,480
- I don't know how to do this.
- Do what?

175
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,120
Just help me.

176
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,280
Can you just...

177
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,920
Just make this easy for me?

178
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,400
You wanna get in my car?

179
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
- How long have you been here?
- Sorry?

180
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,240
- How long have you been here?
- In San Junipero?

181
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,120
Uh... Couple of months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

182
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,760
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

183
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah.

184
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,160
Hey. You okay?

185
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,200
Yeah.

186
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,880
Stop!

187
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,600
Sorry, but...

188
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,520
Man, your face!

189
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,280
Wow.

190
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,280
- You like it?
- It's just so big.

191
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,040
Reminds me of where I grew up.

192
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,760
Miss your mom?

193
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,480
You have to show me.

194
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,760
- Okay.
- Okay.

195
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,920
You never slept with a woman before?

196
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,120
That's not a critique.
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

197
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,520
No, never with a woman.

198
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
Never with anyone.

199
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,120
Not anyone?

200
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,080
- What, in town or...?
- No. No one, nowhere.

201
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,920
- I guess you deflowered me.
- I deflowered you?

202
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,880
What is this? Merry England?

203
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,200
Shut up.

204
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,280
You've had relationships though.

205
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,160
Mnh-mnh.

206
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,240
Hello! You got a fiancé.

207
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,840
- It's complicated.
- Yeah, I'll say.

208
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,200
When did you know...

209
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,760
- that you liked women?
- I like men too.

210
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,480
Equal rights.

211
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,600
Okay.

212
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,840
But when did you know?

213
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
Do you always know?

214
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,720
I was married to a guy.
A long time, I was married.

215
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,160
I always knew.

216
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,080
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

217
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,720
co-workers, friends,
some waitress that served me.

218
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,160
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

219
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,160
Never acted on any of it.

220
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,960
Never did anything.

221
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
I was in love with him.

222
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,000
I really was in love with him.

223
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,200
But he chose not to stick around.

224
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,320
So now it's me.
And I'm passing through.

225
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,760
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

226
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm just gonna have a good time.

227
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,560
Time's nearly up.

228
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,400
Then let's lie here.

229
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,400
Excuse me?

230
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,680
Have you seen Kelly?

231
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,600
- What's that?
- Kelly.

232
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,040
I haven't seen her all night.

233
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,880
You tried the Quagmire?

234
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,800
What is the Quagmire?

235
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,320
- Whoa! Hey!
- I'm sorry!

236
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,200
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

237
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,520
Tucker's.

238
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,760
- Kelly's friend, huh?
- Do you know where to find her?

239
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,400
- How would I know that?
- You're her friend.

240
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,280
<i>- Was</i> a friend.
- Has she been here?

241
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
No.

242
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,000
You too, huh?

243
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,160
Well...

244
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,680
Hey. Try a different time.

245
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,960
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

246
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,120
She's worth the shot, right?

247
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,680
<i>Introducing the totally redesigned
Chrysler Cordoba.</i>

248
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,280
<i>All the luxury you expect is here.</i>

249
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,320
<i>But so is gas mileage...</i>

250
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,880
No, no, no.

251
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

252
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
Golden age, right?

253
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,160
- Right.
- You playing or...

254
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.

255
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,560
Maybe... next time.

256
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Kelly?

257
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,880
Yeah!

258
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,480
<i> You're beautiful!</i>

259
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,840
<i>- Select a song!</i>
- Hi.

260
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,480
Ladies' room.

261
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,800
Hey.

262
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,000
Hey. No, you...

263
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
Wait a minute.

264
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,800
Why are you here?

265
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,040
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

266
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,800
I like a change of music.

267
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,360
How the hell is this your era?

268
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,560
- You hid from me.
- One, I did not.

269
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,360
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

270
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,400
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

271
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,680
You don't know who I am.

272
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,240
You don't know what this means.

273
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,440
This means fun.

274
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,480
Or it should. And this...

275
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,800
This is not fun, okay?

276
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,480
This is not fun.

277
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,280
So you don't feel bad?

278
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,880
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

279
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,120
Have you seen a girl?
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

280
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,760
Uh...

281
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,920
Oh, jeez.

282
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Hey.

283
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,720
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

284
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,880
Yeah, I think so.

285
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,960
- Okay, listen.
- How many of them are dead?

286
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,680
Like what percentage?

287
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,520
As in full-timers?

288
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,160
Eighty. Eighty-five.

289
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm sorry.

290
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,200
- I'm not gonna jump.
- I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

291
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,840
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

292
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,480
I don't know, do feelings.

293
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,040
You freaked me out.

294
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,600
I don't want to like anyone.

295
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,720
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

296
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,160
It's that...

297
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,240
I don't know how long there is.

298
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,040
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something...

299
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,200
Next week it is.

300
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,400
I'm getting married.

301
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
Next week?

302
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,280
To nice Greg?

303
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,160
- Sure you're going through with that?
- I have to.

304
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
- You have to?
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,720
He really is a good guy.

306
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,880
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

307
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,120
they can't stop us.

308
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,720
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

309
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:52,760
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

310
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,240
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

311
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
What does that mean?

312
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
They tell me three months.

313
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,040
It's spread basically everywhere.

314
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,560
They said three months before
six months ago.

315
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,560
So, you know, what do they know?

316
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,240
Doesn't even taste of anything.

317
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,800
- But so you'll stay here after?
- No.

318
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,600
When I'm done, I am done.

319
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,920
But that's cra... I mean...

320
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,240
- Why?
- Richard.

321
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
That's...

322
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,760
My husband's name was Richard.

323
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,320
He died just two years ago.

324
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,240
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

325
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Pass over.

326
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,520
Didn't take it.

327
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,120
- Didn't want to take it.
- Why wouldn't anyone take it?

328
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,960
He had his viewpoint.

329
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,960
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

330
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
and this place was one of them.

331
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,560
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

332
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,880
Shit.

333
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,400
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

334
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,320
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

335
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,360
- Yeah, you could have.
- No, I wouldn't.

336
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
- We could have met outside all this.
- No.

337
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,120
You... would not have got me at all.

338
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
At all.

339
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,240
If we really met, I mean...

340
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,720
If we<i> really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

341
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
Try me.

342
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,000
Or you'd...
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

343
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,320
- You'd come and then...
- Try me.

344
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
Why?

345
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,000
Why? What's the point?

346
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,200
What? Where are you? Houston?

347
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,920
Carson City, Nevada.

348
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,040
So come on.

349
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,200
I showed you mine.

350
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,080
Where are you?

351
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,600
- I can just look it up.
- Santa Rosa, California.

352
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,400
- That's no distance.
- I don't want you to...

353
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,600
- I don't want you to see me. I'm scared...
- And I'm dying.

354
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Whatever you are can't scare me.

355
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,920
Let me come visit.

356
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,480
I want to say hi.

357
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,400
Here you go.

358
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
You okay?

359
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,200
<i>Please check in at our self-service pods</i>

360
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,080
<i>using swipe cards provided.</i>

361
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,840
- You must be Kelly.
- I guess I must.

362
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,160
- She's waiting for you.
- Thank you.

363
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,960
Please.

364
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,520
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

365
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,440
But she can hear you.

366
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
I'll give you some privacy.

367
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,880
Hello, stupid.

368
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,800
It's good to see you.

369
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,720
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

370
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,600
It is.

371
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,840
- I'm Greg.
- You're Greg?

372
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,240
Holy shit.

373
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:06,080
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

374
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,440
before she passes over.

375
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,280
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

376
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,640
She's passing over?

377
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,600
- When?
- Uh...

378
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,040
- Let's go grab a coffee.
- Okay.

379
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,720
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she did not.

380
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,320
- Said she was just visiting.
- More like sampling the trial version.

381
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,040
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

382
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,080
We talk on the comm box.

383
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,800
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

384
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,720
And how long she's been that way?

385
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,840
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

386
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,600
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

387
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,440
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

388
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,600
It's not natural and so forth.

389
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,720
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

390
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,920
- When she was 21?
- More than 40 years back.

391
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,040
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

392
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,640
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

393
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,240
The biggest deal.

394
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,240
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

395
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,720
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

396
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,680
I guess you're the same.

397
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,240
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

398
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,320
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

399
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,280
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

400
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,400
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

401
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,720
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

402
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,760
immersive nostalgia therapy.

403
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,360
Plunge you into a world of memories.

404
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,440
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

405
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,760
Small mercies.

406
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,400
So...

407
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,440
About this marriage...

408
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,760
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

409
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,960
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

410
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,440
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

411
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,360
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

412
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,640
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

413
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,960
But a spouse can override them.

414
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:24,160
- Hence the wedding bells.
- You got it.

415
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,280
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

416
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,200
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

417
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,640
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

418
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,720
If you can call it dying.

419
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,920
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

420
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,080
I guess.

421
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,240
You gonna wear a suit?

422
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,520
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

423
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,400
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

424
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,800
You're a good man.

425
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,280
It's the least I could do, right?

426
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,120
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

427
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,240
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

428
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,920
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

429
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,840
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

430
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,080
I know, but can you?

431
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,760
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every...

432
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,800
I only want a moment.

433
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,800
Ma'am.

434
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,880
- You got five minutes
- Thank you.

435
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,720
Hey!

436
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,080
I've never been here
during the daylight.

437
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,080
It's warm.

438
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,800
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

439
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,000
Oh.

440
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,160
- You're passing over tomorrow?
- Yeah.

441
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,960
Couple of hours after the wedding.

442
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,120
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

443
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

444
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,960
- I'm gonna say something crazy.
- Okay.

445
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,760
Wanna marry me instead?

446
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,720
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

447
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,360
Why not someone you've connected with?

448
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,200
Is that a yes?

449
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,720
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

450
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,960
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

451
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,840
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

452
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,160
Hold tight.

453
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,800
There you go.

454
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Nearly there.

455
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,360
That's it.

456
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,360
Are you sure you're all right?

457
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,440
Hey!

458
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:55,160
You didn't dress up to see me?

459
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,920
Oh...

460
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,440
Come on!

461
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,680
Better?

462
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,800
Whoop!

463
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,200
Oh!

464
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,360
Oh! Whoo!

465
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,080
Looks so real.

466
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,120
It feels so real!

467
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,880
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

468
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,960
I just love it.

469
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,720
- You've been here before.
- But now I live here!

470
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,520
Be with me.

471
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,480
- I'm with you now.
- That's not what I mean.

472
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,760
Pass over.

473
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,040
- When it's your time.
- Yorkie.

474
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,480
- Stay here with me.
- Can we just enjoy tonight?

475
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
It's almost midnight.

476
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,000
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

477
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,720
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

478
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,920
- You know I'm just a visitor.
- What, a couple of months, then what?

479
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,720
- We're not discussing this.
- Then you're gone.

480
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,640
- Just gone. You could have forever.
- Forever?

481
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,960
- Who can even make sense of forever?
- However long you want then.

482
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,640
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

483
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,520
It's not a trap.

484
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,000
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

485
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,400
- I'm going.
- Hey! Oh. Hey.

486
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
It's real.

487
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,840
This is real.

488
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,080
And this.

489
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,120
- Hmm?
- Come on.

490
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,040
You know that was just a gesture.

491
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,720
- You married me.
- To help you pass over.

492
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,680
- As a... kindness.
- It's not so kind to leave.

493
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,720
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

494
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,520
I got this chance.

495
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,400
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

496
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,440
I said I made my choice.

497
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,640
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

498
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,320
- Because that was his choice.
- Don't.

499
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,080
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

500
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,120
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

501
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,480
- You don't know what you're saying.
- You should be mad at him.

502
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,600
- Not whipping yourself with guilt.
- Get off me.

503
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,560
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

504
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,680
Forty-nine years...

505
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,120
I was with him for 49 years.

506
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,720
You can't begin to imagine.

507
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,440
You can't know...

508
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,840
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

509
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,280
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

510
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,920
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

511
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,040
Everything we sacrificed.

512
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,000
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

513
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,440
Did you think to ask?

514
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,000
Did it occur to you to ask?

515
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,960
We had a daughter.

516
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,920
Alison.

517
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,720
Always difficult, always beautiful.

518
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,520
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

519
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:45,680
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

520
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,880
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

521
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,160
- Well, I didn't know...
- Didn't think to.

522
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,240
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

523
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:59,960
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

524
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,720
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

525
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,480
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

526
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,960
And so he went.

527
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,360
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

528
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,080
that they're together, but I don't.

529
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:21,000
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

530
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,680
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

531
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,160
Now you give me some sales pitch

532
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,120
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

533
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,240
I'm sorry.

534
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,520
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

535
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,400
End up like Wes?

536
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,600
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

537
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,760
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

538
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,760
But I'm out. I'm gone.

539
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,720
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

540
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,760
Hey, Kelly.

541
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,760
- You all right?
- Yeah, I am fine.

542
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,600
- Well, okay then.
- Huh?

543
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,040
Kelly?

544
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,280
All things considered...

545
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,760
I guess I'm ready.

546
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,400
For what?

547
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,680
For the rest of it.

548
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,840
Ready?

549
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,840
Whoo!

550
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,040
Whoo!
