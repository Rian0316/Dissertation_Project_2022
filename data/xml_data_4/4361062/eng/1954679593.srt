And how dare you?

182
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,404
Oh, I'm sorry, the restaurant
doesn't open until tomorrow.

183
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,838
Actually, no.

184
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,308
Hi. I'm here to apply for a waitress job.

185
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:20,842
At your age?

186
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,544
I'm 27!

187
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,313
And?

188
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:26,682
Max, I can't breathe.

189
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:29,918
And I'm here to apply for a pastry chef.

190
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,422
Also 27, but I've looked
this old since I was 6.

191
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:36,525
For a while, I thought I had
that Benjamin Button's disease.

192
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,961
I'll take the pastry chef first.

193
00:08:38,962 --> 00:08:40,362
Why don't you sit over there and wait.

194
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:42,597
I won't be long, because frankly,

195
00:08:42,598 --> 00:08:45,367
you don't have the time.

196
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:47,569
Thank you. I'll be over there.

197
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,540
Applying for Social Security.

198
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,809
So where did you go to pastry school,

199
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,677
and why aren't you working now?

200
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,246
Manhattan School Of
Pastry, and I am working.

201
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,048
I have my own cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

202
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:02,384
Oh, it's almost over.

203
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,652
This interview? Great.

204
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:05,554
No. Not the interview. Brooklyn.

205
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:07,055
Brooklyn's almost over.

206
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:10,759
Also, cupcakes.

207
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,295
Cool. I will tell them.

208
00:09:13,296 --> 00:09:14,730
Wish I knew that before they all got

209
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,699
their belly buttons pierced
trying to stay cool.

210
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,801
Oh, great. A sense of humor.

211
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,303
Customers love that.

212
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:24,239
I don't, but they do.

213
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,676
So, um, where's this Joe guy
who's doing the hiring?

214
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:30,245
There is no "Joe guy". I'm Joe.

215
00:09:30,246 --> 00:09:32,147
Spelled, J-O-E-D-T-H.

216
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,150
The D-T-H is silent.

217
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:38,286
As am I, because I want this job.

218
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,389
Well, I guess I can put these away then.

219
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,057
That was your plan?

220
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:45,427
To expose your breasts and
seduce your way into this job?

221
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:50,065
You say that like it's a bad thing.

222
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,566
Okay. Well, bye.

223
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,135
Sit, sit.

224
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,469
If you really can bake,

225
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,405
this position might be perfect for you.

226
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:57,606
Also, you have that edgy,

227
00:09:57,607 --> 00:09:59,875
"I don't give a crap" attitude.

228
00:09:59,876 --> 00:10:01,076
Customers love that.

229
00:10:01,077 --> 00:10:03,912
I don't, but they do.

230
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:08,250
Actually, Joe, silent D-T-H, I can bake.

231
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:09,785
But how well?

232
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:13,255
My girlfriend and I are
obsessed with French pastry.

233
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:18,360
Oh. Girlfriend as in "girlfriend,"

234
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,928
or as in two ladies of a certain age

235
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:23,465
at a Cineplex splitting
one thing of popcorn?

236
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:26,368
Everything you just said offended me.

237
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:29,438
Yeah, that's my brand.

238
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,672
And the fact that you didn't cry

239
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,007
about splitting a popcorn makes me think

240
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:34,776
it's the first kind of girlfriend.

241
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,011
How are your macaroons?

242
00:10:40,316 --> 00:10:41,917
Uh... oh. Mm.

243
00:10:41,918 --> 00:10:45,687
My macaroons?

244
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,957
Great.

245
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,194
A little bit of French heaven.

246
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:54,029
What is your name?

247
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,331
Max.

248
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:59,668
M-a-x.

249
00:10:59,669 --> 00:11:01,369
[clicks teeth]

250
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,839
Nothing is silent. Ever.

251
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,274
So I gather.

252
00:11:06,275 --> 00:11:09,277
Okay. Why don't you go fill
out an application, Max.

253
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:10,846
And you can put those away again.

254
00:11:10,847 --> 00:11:13,647
I'm really not into big-breasted women.

255
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:17,685
Girl, you got this.

256
00:11:22,425 --> 00:11:25,127
First day. Are you nervous, girl?

257
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:27,796
Please. Nervous is telling
your elderly Mormon parents

258
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:29,698
that you're gay after
your three older siblings

259
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,801
already came out.

260
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:35,670
I have no idea what most
of these desserts are.

261
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:39,708
I haven't felt this lost
since the finale of<i> Lost.</i>

262
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:42,777
Max, can you see any of the
Barney's price tags on these?

263
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:43,979
Uh, I think there's one bunching up

264
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,647
inside the back of your pants.

265
00:11:45,648 --> 00:11:48,884
No, that's the underwear
I'm also returning.

266
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,685
Here she comes.

267
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,554
Hi, ladies. This is Naomi,

268
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,122
the dessert bar hostess.

269
00:11:54,123 --> 00:11:56,156
Go, Naomi, go.

270
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:04,065
Gorgeous, but as dumb as whoever
is the hot new idiot right now.

271
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:06,735
Let me take a look at you.

272
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,770
Good-bye.

273
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:10,539
Already?

274
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,008
Those pearls. They have to go.

275
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,376
Really? It's just, well,

276
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,578
I'm kind of emotionally
attached to them.

277
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:19,047
Well, honey, I love my
half-blind French bulldog,

278
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:22,250
but I don't wear her around my neck.

279
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,586
Max, let me take a look.

280
00:12:24,587 --> 00:12:25,554
Love it.

281
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,889
Fabulous. Well done.

282
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,226
Hi, Joe. Big day. I'm so excited.

283
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:35,096
Why don't you be excited
in the back, doll?

284
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,932
I want Max up front now.

285
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,601
All my life, people have been
telling me not to come out.

286
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:43,438
Why should here be any different?

287
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:47,209
Ladies, I just got word that
the<i> New York Times</i> food critic

288
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,178
may make a surprise
visit this afternoon.

289
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,180
Everything has to be perfect...

290
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:53,748
the service, the desserts,

291
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:56,851
the precarious balance of my meds.

292
00:12:56,852 --> 00:12:59,154
Nothing can go wrong.

293
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,755
Naomi.

294
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:02,623
Fetch.

295
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:06,461
"Welcome to The High".

296
00:13:06,462 --> 00:13:08,463
"Hi. Welcome to The High".

297
00:13:08,464 --> 00:13:09,931
"Welcome to The High".

298
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:14,302
Stop saying high. It reminds me I'm not.

299
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,271
Wait, Max, you're not high?

300
00:13:16,272 --> 00:13:18,206
Like, not high at all?

301
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,476
No. I didn't want to screw today up.

302
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:24,412
What the hell is wrong with you?

303
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,748
You can't change who you are today.

304
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:27,882
The<i> New York Times</i> is coming.

305
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:29,517
How will you cope?

306
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,420
I mean, when's the last
time you weren't high?

307
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:35,156
My birth.

308
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,691
But I was really drunk.

309
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,094
I had just had a bottle of wine.

310
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,062
Well, my mother had.

311
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:42,497
I have to go wait on those customers.

312
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:43,965
Do what you can to get with the program.

313
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:45,834
I mean, get off the program.

314
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:49,471
You can't bake not baked.

315
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,972
Big Mary?

316
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:52,207
John?

317
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,875
Why not try my new name?

318
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,311
Quasimodo.

319
00:13:56,312 --> 00:13:57,712
Do you have any weed?

320
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,414
Do I have any weed?

321
00:13:59,415 --> 00:14:02,217
Let me check my hump.

322
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:05,587
Nope. No weed.

323
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:07,255
Thanks, Rico. I didn't want to ask

324
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,523
due to the city-wide ban
on racial profiling.

325
00:14:11,694 --> 00:14:13,762
Wow. This dish room is cleaner

326
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:18,199
than Chris Christie's plate after lunch.

327
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,001
Max, I need two lavender macaroons.

328
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:22,070
- Where are they?
- I'm working on them.

329
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,806
Well, good. I'm so proud of you.

330
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:27,808
This is so<i> Freaky Friday.</i>

331
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:32,213
Here are the lavender macaroons.

332
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:35,216
See? Even just holding this, I'm better.

333
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:37,686
Now we just have to hope
nothing goes wrong.

334
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,253
(Sophie) Surprise!

335
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:47,060
We all came to support you.

336
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,821
(Caroline) Well, that's it.

337
00:14:56,822 --> 00:14:58,830
The<i> New York Times</i> food critic
may be in the same room

338
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,333
as Han, Earl, Oleg, and Sophie.

339
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:05,304
We're dead. Time of death, 11:30.

340
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:07,872
I believe it's more like 4:20.

341
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,513
Oh, Caroline, I love your new place.

342
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,982
It's so fresh and pretty.

343
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:21,286
It kind of looks like
a douche commercial.

344
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,688
You're right, baby.

345
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,657
It looks exactly like
a douche commercial.

346
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,627
Okay. Can we stop saying "douche"

347
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,362
in the fancy pastry shop?

348
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:33,398
I agree. Not appropriate.

349
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,901
Caroline, darling, slip my phone number

350
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,804
to that fine Nubian princess.

351
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,139
And tell her not to be
fooled by my bad hip.

352
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,944
I can still gently rock her world.

353
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,779
Okay, guys, what are you doing here

354
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,548
and how quickly can you leave?

355
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,682
Real nice.

356
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,850
After we came all this way

357
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,418
to just order only desserts

358
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,853
that Max knows how to make

359
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,723
and to say nice things
about you as a waitress.

360
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,691
Oh, you'd do that for me?

361
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,926
Hell no, I can't pull that off.

362
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,297
If I could act, I'd sell the restaurant

363
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,699
and get cast in two-line
roles as the doctor

364
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,002
on any network television show.

365
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,504
Sophie's the actress.

366
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,207
And trust me, she's got
quite a repertoire.

367
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,542
In bed, I call her Meryl Sheets.

368
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,543
Do it, baby.

369
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:27,419
[Southern Belle accent]
Oh, what a lovely place.

370
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,488
That's the accent she uses when we play

371
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,956
"12 Years A Sex Slave."

372
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,027
Lovely, be right back.

373
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,496
Oh, and, welcome to The High.

374
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,066
(Joedth) What's going
on with that table?

375
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,902
Is there a European circus in town?

376
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:46,071
A circus? Well, I wouldn't know.

377
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,706
I really have no idea who they are.

378
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:50,108
That didn't require an answer.

379
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,345
It was just one of my
dead-on observations.

380
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,013
Just get rid of them.

381
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,886
Tell them we've run out of funnel cakes.

382
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:05,524
Well, I'm feeling like my old self.

383
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,126
Joe just told me to lose
Han, Earl, Oleg, and Sophie.

384
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,395
How am I supposed to
lose that many people?

385
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,798
I'm not air traffic control.

386
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,699
You are acting like they
don't know how to act

387
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,535
in a fancy place.

388
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,537
[Sophie, yelling] Girls, look!

389
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,973
Oleg's wearing his
napkin as a party hat.

390
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:25,276
[Sophie laughing]

391
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:30,148
Here's your dessert. Bon appetite.

392
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,584
Max, I can't believe you just made that.

393
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,686
Neither can I.

394
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:36,855
And what did you say to Oleg and Sophie?

395
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,690
It's been an hour, and I haven't seen

396
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,226
any over-the-table penetration.

397
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,628
I just told them to be
on their best behavior,

398
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,430
and they're fine with it.

399
00:17:45,431 --> 00:17:47,132
Excuse me, Max.

400
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:48,300
Yes, hi.

401
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,968
May I go tinkle?

402
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:54,272
Or is that against the law here
at Guantanamo Dessert Bay?

403
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm gonna go have sex
in the ladies room.

404
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,244
Unless you two prudes have
a problem with that, too.

405
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,482
Excuse me.

406
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:04,816
Can I get a latte and a red wine?

407
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,251
[clears throat]

408
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,153
'Cause I got a Vicodin
stuck in my throat.

409
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,858
Oh, my God.

410
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,092
Who could be that messed up

411
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,861
in the middle of the afternoon?

412
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:19,464
Uh, my new best friend.

413
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,333
I better get rid of her before Joe

414
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,335
or that<i> Times</i> critic walks in.

415
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,438
You keep doing good things by accident.

416
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,739
Hi, can I get a...

417
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,574
You sure can. Anywhere but here.

418
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,643
(woman) Oh, no. Spinning's
not good for me right now.

419
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,014
(Joedth) What is she doing here?

420
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,249
Leaving. You never saw her.

421
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,884
- Wait...
- Joe, I got this.

422
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:40,385
My bestie at school was totally hooked

423
00:18:40,386 --> 00:18:42,487
on prescription pills for, like, a week.

424
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:45,089
Hey, hi, you.

425
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,059
Excuse me. Where is Max?

426
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,261
She's in the back for a sec.

427
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,829
So...

428
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,731
We meet again.

429
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:55,133
Sir, do you need something in the back?

430
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,636
Yes, Caroline said she'd
bring me a napkin,

431
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:02,240
but I could get Time Warner on
the phone faster than that.

432
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,808
Just ask Max.

433
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,544
She covers for Caroline
all the time at the diner.

434
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,414
Max?

435
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,717
Ooh. Drama at The High.

436
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,719
Han, that's my new boss.

437
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,421
Stop talking.

438
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,758
Also, stop collecting stickers.
You're a grown-up.

439
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,994
Okay, I threw that drug addict out.

440
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,031
That drug addict is my girlfriend.

441
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,366
More drama at The High.

442
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,502
And Caroline, we have a problem.

443
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,203
You called Allie a drug addict.

444
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,338
Oh, is that her name?

445
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,739
Allie? So cute.

446
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,641
Even lovelier.

447
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,643
And according to that very small man,

448
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,880
you're also a terrible waitress.

449
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:45,016
But I had no idea you two were together.

450
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,520
I would have thought a powerful...

451
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,189
Stop. Now.

452
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,125
Joe, look, we really need these jobs.

453
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,294
We made a bad decision
with our bakery business,

454
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,531
and we have a big bank
loan that we can't pay.

455
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,899
Honesty. Good.

456
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,968
People respond to honesty.

457
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:05,904
I don't, but they do.

458
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,472
Max, you have potential here.

459
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:10,174
Caroline, you're fired as a waitress.

460
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:12,877
Are you sure?

461
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,278
Stop!

462
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:20,517
There's nothing in there to save you.

463
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:24,990
Well, if she's fired, I'm fired, too.

464
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,325
Oh, relax, Norma Rae.

465
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,194
She's fired as a waitress,

466
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:31,029
but she's hired as a hostess.

467
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,865
I am? Why?

468
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,867
Because you're pretty,
you flashed a boob,

469
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:38,670
and you took more control
of Allie in five minutes

470
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:42,007
than anybody's been able to
do in her three rehab stints.

471
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:46,610
And that, lady, is a
New York City hostess.

472
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:53,752
Well, girls, I struck out.

473
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:58,189
Bill Cosby has ruined it
for all black men over 70

474
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,126
who are just trying
to buy a gal a drink.

475
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,932
Max, how do you like that?

476
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,135
I'm the hostess. I got a promotion!

477
00:21:10,136 --> 00:21:11,803
I don't think a hostess is a promo...

478
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,139
It is, Max, 'cause with a
less-than-zero bank balance,

479
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,973
it has to be. It's all I have left.
