1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,470
All right,
that's the last servo.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,440
Behold the Mobile
Omnidirectional Neutralization
and Termination Eradicator.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,760
Or...MONTE.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,030
Featuring one articulated razor-sharp
killing saw,one polycarbonate grinding
and flipping wheel,

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,530
steel-armor plate exoskeleton
top and bottom,and enough horsepower to drive
a 110 pounds of mechanized death

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,650
from zero to holy crap
in 4.8 seconds.

7
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,020
Is it wrong to say I
love our killer robot?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,410
As with my father,
I both love and fear it.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,600
All right, enough chitchat.
Let's destroy something.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,720
1,2,3

11
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,760
Okay. What shall be first
to taste the wrath of Monte?

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,840
*************

13
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:51,620
**************

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,900
Did it when I was four.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,340
It's an icosahedral dye
floating in tinted blue water.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,550
Man, call "spoiler alert"
before you say things like that.

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,970
How about the toaster oven?

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,910
What did the toaster
oven ever do to you?

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,390
What did I ever do to Jimmy
Mullins in the third grade?

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,320
He still punched me in
the face with my own fists.

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,140
Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in
the wrong boys' room at the wrong time.

22
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,400
Gentlemen, goggles.

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,570
This is an auspicious moment.

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,550
Like Robert Oppenheimer
or Neil Armstrong,

25
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,120
we need the appropriate words to
mark this historic scientific event.

26
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,120
How about "Die, toaster, die"?

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,160
That'll do it.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,500
All right, what's next?

29
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,190
No, I think I'm just going to
stay in tonight and do laundry.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,300

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:24,810

32
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,640

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,460
Oh, yeah, this door got the full Monte.

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,220
Leonard?

35
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,180
What the hell?

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,410
Killer robot. We built it.

37
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,680
Yeah, well, it almost killed me.

38
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,770
If it wanted to kill you, you'd be dead.

39
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,360
So, who exactly does it want to kill?

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:57,880
I'm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern
California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,880
You know, since I moved last year,
not all my mail has been forwarded.

42
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,030
It's a big deal.

43
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,800
There's an awards banquet
and a dance afterward.

44
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,170
Perhaps you'd like to come with me.

45
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,570
I know the other fellas would be
really excited to see a girl there.

46
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,050
How is it supposed to be a
dance if I'm the only girl?

47
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,950
Well, that may be a slight exaggeration.

48
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,560
You'd be the only doable girl.

49
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,650
You're a pig, Howard.

50
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,620
How is "doable" anything
but a compliment?

51
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,230
Howard, why don't we
just work on the robot?

52
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,390
Please, Leonard, not now.

53
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:42,390
Once again, Penny and I
have begun our little tango.

54
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,580
Our tango?

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,700
The carnal repartee,
the erotic to and fro.

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,050
But as delicious as
the appetizer might be,

57
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:56,410
at some point we will have to succumb
and eat the entr\e while it's still...

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,990
hot.

59
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,410
I'm begging you, stop talking.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,270
Look, normally I can just ignore you.

61
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,980
I mean, I get it--
you're a little peculiar.

62
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,100
You know, like Sheldon.

63
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,180
Excuse me, Penny, but in this
room, you're the one who's peculiar.

64
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,460
Yeah, you might be right.

65
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,300
But back to you.

66
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,080
I know you think you're some sort
of smooth-talking ladies' man,

67
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,530
but the truth is, you are
just pathetic and creepy.

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,890
So what are you saying?

69
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,590
I am saying it is not a
compliment to call me "doable."

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,920
It's not sexy to stare
at my ass and say, Ooh,

71
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,050
it must be jelly 'cause
jam don't shake like that.

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,670
And most important, we are not dancing
a tango, we're not to'ing and fro'ing.

73
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,750
Nothing is ever going to
happen between us. Ever.

74
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,810
Wait a minute. This isn't
flirting. You're serious.

75
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,140
Flirting? You think
I'm flirting with you?

76
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,500
I am not flirting with you.

77
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,410
No woman is ever gonna flirt with you.

78
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,710
You're just gonna
grow old and die alone.

79
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,840
Thanks for the heads up.

80
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,950
Howard, where you going?

81
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,180
I'm going home to live
my creepy, pathetic life.

82
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,340
Well, someone had to say it.

83
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,320
What?

84
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,520
He said maybe we should enter you
in the killer robot competition.

85
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,500
Howard, the phone is ringing!

86
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,870
Here's a crazy idea, Ma: Answer it!

87
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,820
Hello?

88
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,430
All right, hold on.

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
It's your friend, Leonard!

90
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,150
He wants to know why
you're not at school today!

91
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,960
I don't go to school, Ma.
I work at a university.

92
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,210
That's a school! Now pick up the phone!

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,140
I don't want to talk to anybody.

94
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,930
Should I ask Leonard to
bring over your homework? !

95
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,430
I don't have homework.

96
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,250
I'm a grown man with a
master's degree in engineering!

97
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,750
Excuse me, Mr. Fancy-Pants.

98
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,800
Want me to get you a Popsicle?

99
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,070
Cherry, please!

100
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,360
I ate the cherry. All
that's left is green.

101
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,300
You make me want to kill myself.

102
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,100
What's going on?

103
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,640
I don't know, now they're
just yelling about Popsicles.

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,200
Sounds like Penny really got to him.

105
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,100
I'm not surprised.

106
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,150
Despite his hard and crusty shell,
Howard is a very sensitive man.

107
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:02,790
Do you know he writes poetry?

108
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,440
Mostly about men from Nantucket
and hermits named Dave,

109
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,020
but he does it with real sensitivity.

110
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,530
Hey, Hofstadter.

111
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,650
Word around the pwasma
wab is you built a wobot?

112
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,370
Yes, we did, Kripke.

113
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,370
His name is Monte.

114
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,380
Well, if you have any dewusions
about entering him against my wobot,

115
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,750
the Kwipke Kwippler in the Southern California
Robot Fighting League Wound Wobin Invitational,

116
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,230
aka the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.,

117
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,290
his name is gonna be Swrap Metal.

118
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,700
Come on, is that really necessary?

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,440
Leonard, I believe it is.

120
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,550
This is trash talk, and trash talk is a
traditional component in all sporting events.

121
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,060
Kripke, your robot is inferior
and it will be defeated by ours

122
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,460
because ours exceeds yours
in both design and execution.

123
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,500
Also, I'm given to understand
that your mother is overweight.

124
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,010
Oh, snap.

125
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,120
Now, of course, if that is the result of a
glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony,

126
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,720
I withdraw that comment.

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,990
What difference does
it make? Fat is fat.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,980
There are boundaries.

129
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,160
Tell you what, forget
the S.C.R.F.L.R.R.I.

130
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,740
Wet's settle this woboto a woboto.

131
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,250
What do you mean?

132
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,050
There's no guarantee we're gonna go
against each other in the Wound Wobin,

133
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,130
so let's throw down.

134
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,370
You know, unless you're afwaid.

135
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,710
We accept your challenge.
Name a time and place.

136
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,370
Tomorrow, 3:00, the kinetics wab.

137
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,380
Make it so.

138
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,400
No, don't make it so. Barry,
we can't fight you tomorrow.

139
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,650
Our engineer is incapacitated.

140
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,680
What's wrong with him?

141
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,490
He's depressed because he's pathetic
and creepy and can't get girls.

142
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,340
We're all pathetic and
cweepy and can't get girls.

143
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,680
That's why we fight wobots.

144
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,130
If you're not there, you'll
be exposed to widicule.

145
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm curious, what part of
America is that accent from?

146
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,420
Hey, you got a minute?

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,840
Yeah, come on in. What's up?

148
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,080
- I need you to apologize to How...
- Get out.

149
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,640
Come on. Wolowitz won't come out of his
house and we need him for a robot battle.

150
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,080
Well, then have the
robot go and get him.

151
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,760
The robot didn't hurt his feelings.

152
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,770
His feelings needed to be hurt.

153
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,530
He's been in bed for two days.

154
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,340
Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll.

155
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:34,020
He's not with a...

156
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,950
Does it really matter
who or what he's with?

157
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,610
The guy is devastated.

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,200
Oh, please, how could I
possibly devastate Howard?

159
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:44,640
Okay, don't take this as a criticism,

160
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,770
but you kind of have that
overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on.

161
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,340
What does that mean?

162
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,340
You know, like, most of the time,
you're the easygoing Bruce Banner,

163
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,220
but then, when you get angry, you
kind of turn into, like, you know...

164
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,680
I turn into a bear?

165
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,050
Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner?

166
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,680
You didn't get The
Incredible Hulk from that?

167
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,920
Never mind. Just, please go talk to him.

168
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,010
And say what? That I didn't
mean it, because I meant it.

169
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,530
Well, maybe you can go at it
from a different angle, like, um,

170
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,980
you see a glimmer of goodness in
him and you only said what you said

171
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,900
because you want to nurture
it and make it shine.

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,310
Okay, let's try it this way.

173
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,740
Remember the day that we first met

174
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,450
and you asked me to go to your
boyfriend's apartment to get your TV back

175
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,100
and he was nine feet tall and he
took my pants off and you said...

176
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,840
What was that? What did you say?

177
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,310
Oh, yes. You said you owed me one.

178
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,930
Okay, come on, that's not fair.

179
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,910
I came home with no pants.

180
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,410
Fine, I'll go over there tomorrow.

181
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,770
Thank you.

182
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,500
I should probably give you
a heads up about his mother.

183
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,170
What about her?

184
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,000
She's a delightful
woman. You'll love her.

185
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,550
Howard, there's a blonde
girl, Patsy, here to see you!

186
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,520
Who?

187
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,610
Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.

188
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,180
I don't want to talk to her.

189
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,410
Ma!

190
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,270
She ran past me.

191
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,020
Was I supposed to tackle her?

192
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,130
So, I just came by to
see how you were doing.

193
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,740
I'm fine.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,840
Good. Your mom seems nice.

195
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,970
People move away from her on the bus.

196
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,960
What do you want?

197
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:54,610
Okay, look. Howard, I
just want to apologize.

198
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,200
For some things that I have said.

199
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,160
About you.

200
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,070
I've been informed
that you have feelings.

201
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,120
And apparently, I have hurt them.

202
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,860
So, I'm sorry.

203
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:22,200
Howard.

204
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:26,130
Fine. You're sorry. Good-bye.

205
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,890
So... you're okay?

206
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,670
Hey, I'm a big boy.

207
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm not traumatized by some random
comment from some random woman.

208
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,740
I mean, get over yourself.

209
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,570
Okay. Well, bye.

210
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,080
So close.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,570
Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?

212
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,450
As you can see, the Kwippler is
weducing the Chevy Cavawier to wubble.

213
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,140
I can't watch anymore.

214
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,710
Sheldon, we have to call it off.

215
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,190
We don't have that option.

216
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,460
We've accepted the challenge.

217
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,910
We can't run away from a fight.

218
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,940
Oh, please, we've spent our whole
lives running away from fights.

219
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,270
Personally, I can squeeze through
a hole in a fence half my size.

220
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,800
Impressive as that may
be, Monte is not us.

221
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,950
Monte has no fear.

222
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,310
Sheldon, did we all not
just watch the same video?

223
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,410
Kripke's robot just had angry
sex with a mid-sized automobile.

224
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,690
You are overlooking the fact that
we now know what we're up against

225
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,250
and we can modify Monte
so that he's prepared.

226
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,610
You want to prepare him?

227
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,260
Install a bladder and a pair
of shorts so he can wet himself.

228
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,460
Excuse me, but how are we going to
make any modifications without Wolowitz?

229
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,100
- Have you heard from Penny yet?
- Not yet.

230
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:56,750
Have faith, gentlemen.
We don't need Wolowitz.

231
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,660
Engineering is merely the slow
younger brother of physics.

232
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,430
Watch and learn.

233
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,440
Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?

234
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,000
And then, when I was
14, I met Marcy Grossman.

235
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,920
She was so beautiful.

236
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:26,630
She just got her braces off but
they left a little of the overbite.

237
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,510
It was so hot.

238
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,230
Like a sexy little chipmunk.

239
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,450
I didn't have the
courage to ask her out,

240
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,010
but I dedicated a song to her
at the ninth grade talent show.

241
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,540
Aw, that sounds sweet.

242
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,060
* Marcy Grossman is sunshine *

243
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,770
* On a cloudy day *

244
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,550
* When it's cold outside *

245
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,430
* Marcy Grossman is the month of May *

246
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,550
Oh, it's cute.

247
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,050
* I guess you'd say *

248
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,580
* What can make me feel this way *

249
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,150
* Marcy Grossman, Marcy
Grossman, Marcy Grossman *

250
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,650
* Talkin' 'bout Marcy * That's great.

251
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,540
* Grossman.*

252
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,940
Oh, it's fun.

253
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:28,460
And then she came up with
that sexy little chipmunk mouth

254
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,930
and spit in my hair.

255
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,490
Which brings us to tenth grade.

256
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,110
Howard, do you think maybe
sometimes you try too hard?

257
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,240
Look at me.

258
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:51,210
What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?

259
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,570
Well... you'd have a terrific chance.

260
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,340
I mean, you're smart, you're
funny. You have a cool job.

261
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,220
You build stuff that
goes into outer space.

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,130
I guess.

263
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,420
Look, I'm telling you, I've known
you for, like, a year and a half

264
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,600
and this is the first time I feel
like I'm talking to a real person.

265
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,160
And you know what? I
like him. He's a nice guy.

266
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,790
You really think so?

267
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,870
Yes.

268
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,180
I don't know.

269
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,390
I do.

270
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,940
Nice little bot you've got here.

271
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,910
I'm aware.

272
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,560
- What's this do, spin?
- Yep. At 3400 RPM.

273
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,570
It can cut through
steel like it was wubber.

274
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,640
Neat.

275
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,770
Good work.

276
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,890
Sheldon, we've got to call this off.

277
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,210
No, Leonard.

278
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:03,040
For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies

279
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,730
and humiliating wedgies and the
insensitively named Indian burns.

280
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,140
That stops now.

281
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,490
But, Sheldon, we don't have a chance.

282
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,330
The only improvement you were able to make on the
robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote.

283
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,820
What you fail to realize is
Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw:

284
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,300
overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.

285
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,360
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.

286
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,740
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.

287
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,430
Kripke.

288
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,750
I would ask if your robot is prepared to
meet its maker, but as you are its maker,

289
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,630
clearly the two of you have met.

290
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,830
What is his pwoblem?

291
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,300
Way to bust out the
Jedi mind tricks, dude.

292
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,030
I just want to make sure
that we're all clear.

293
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,000
Standard robotic fighting
league rules apply.

294
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,650
Are you cwazy? This is a stweet fight.

295
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,830
The stweet has no rules.

296
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,360
He's right, Leonard. The
paradigm is to the death.

297
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:11,600
I will, however, give you the
opportunity to concede my superiority now

298
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,030
and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.

299
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,530
Never.

300
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,870
I'd rather see Monte
dead than in your hands.

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,460
That could be easily arranged.

302
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,150
Ready, set, go?

303
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,410
Do it.

304
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,790
All right then. Weady. Set. Go.

305
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,900
Come on, Sheldon, you got this.

306
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,310
Indeed. We are prepared for
anything he can throw at us.

307
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,840
That's new.

308
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,380
- Run, Monte, run!
- Go, Monte!

309
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:54,490
- Monte!
- Go, go, go, go!

310
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,460
Don't hurt us, don't
hurt us, don't hurt us!

311
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,020
Well, so much for making up for
the emotional wounds of childhood.

312
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,910
I did this.

313
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,210
Monte was killed by
my hubris and my pride.

314
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,530
No matter what anybody
says, this is my fault.

315
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,050
No one's arguing with you, dude.

316
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,490
I got your text. How bad is... Oy.

317
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,150
Forget the robot. What happened to you?

318
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,810
He slipped and fell.

319
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,900
Yes, I slipped and
fell. In the bathroom.

320
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,860
Bounced right off the tub.

321
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,030
Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of
doing when you don't treat them with respect.

322
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,980
Yeah.

323
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,370
They sucker punch you
when your eyes are closed.

324
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,500
So what do you think, Howard?

325
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,090
It's not that bad, right?

326
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,040
Oh, no. A little electrical tape,
some solder... Are you insane?

327
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,320
I've seen space probes that crashed into the
desert that were in better shape than this.

328
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,080
You're right. Monte's gone.

329
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,910
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

330
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,860
Leonard, you'll play your cello.

331
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,180
Sheldon, honey, aren't you
getting a little carried away?

332
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,190
I mean, it's just a toy robot.

333
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,590
Just a toy robot?

334
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,930
Penny.

335
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,310
I know, I got it.

336
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,730
Sheldon, I'm sorry.

337
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,250
Well, don't get the wrong idea.

338
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,510
The way I see it, I'm
halfway to pity sex.

339
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,700
