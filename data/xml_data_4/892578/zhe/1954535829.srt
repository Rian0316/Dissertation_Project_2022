无奈只剩下巴尼叔叔孤零零一人

没有人愿意陪巴尼玩 他只能自己做自己的托
It got so bad, Barney tried to be his own wingman.

17
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,310

Hi. Have you met me?

18

他人棒极了  长相也酷毙了
He's the "awesome-est," most best "looking-est," greatest guy ever.

28
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,250
他和巴尼一个样
He's exactly like Barney.

29
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,790
没错
That's what I just said.

30
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,180
巴尼和他的兄弟不是完全一样的

詹姆士是个同性恋
James is gay.

32
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,610
真的? 打死我也不会想猜出
Really? I never in a million years

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,260
你会有个同性恋兄弟?太好了!
would I picture you with a gay brother, that's awesome.

34
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,000
我就是想提醒你一下
Yeah. I just wanted you to have a heads up,

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,460
见到他的时候 你就不会过度惊讶
so you don't act all surprised when he gets here.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,370
为什么从来没有人告诉 过我巴尼有一个黑人同性恋兄弟?
How in God's name did it never come up that Barney has a gay, black brother?

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,970
他是黑人?
Is he black?

45
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,780
我想我这人只注重人的内在美
I guess I'm the kind of person that focuses on who people are on the inside

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,140
而不是他们皮肤的颜色
rather than the color of their skin.

47
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,130
跟你开玩笑的 我只想让你吃惊一下
I'm kidding, I just wanted to see your face.

48
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,430
嗯对  我们又决定结婚了
Yeah, so now the wedding's back on.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,170
不说这个了  詹姆士 你过得怎么样?
Anyway, James, how have you been?

50
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,680
好极了!
Awesome, as per "yoozh."

51
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,660
我刚玩完裸体跳伞  传奇一般!
I just went skinny-skydiving. Legendary.

52
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,470
我的激光游戏组刚打入地区决赛 (laser tag：一种激光枪游戏 )
And my laser tag team, just made it to regional finals.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,230
比传奇更加传奇!
"Legendarier."

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,230
现在你们一定注意到我的西服了
And by now you've noticed the suit--

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,290
来来 摸摸
go 'head, touch it.

56
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,970
皮尔特洛・德拉卡拉　亲手制造
Handcrafted by Pietro Dellacamera,

57
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,790
他是米兰著名的101岁的裁缝
Milan's famous 101-year-old tailor

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,090
在缝完这件西服的最后一针之后
who upon completing the very last stitch

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,110
就死掉了
in this suit dropped dead,

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,140
太讽刺了  因为我穿着 这件西服的帅样也会让他死掉
which is ironic because that is how gorgeous I look in it.

61
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,380
来
C'mon.

62
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,500
支持一下
Gimme five.

63
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,120
支持一下  又流行了?
Is "gimme five" back?

64
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,520
我今天早晨在我博客里宣布的
Oh, yeah. I put it in my blog this morning.

65
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,070
伙计们 "gimme five" 又流行了!
Guys, "gimme five" is back!

66
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,190
詹姆士 这是我的女朋友罗宾
Oh, James, this is my girlfriend, Robin.

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
- 真荣幸认识你 - 我也是
- Hey. It's so nice to meet you. - You, too.

68
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,400
我要问一下  你们俩人的 肤色为什么不一样?
So, I have to ask, there's a story here.

69
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,190
拜托
Please.

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,230
这些年来巴尼和詹姆士 从他们的妈妈那里
The truth is, Barney and James got a lot of...

71
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,630
得到了许多不同的解释
different explanations from their mom over the years.

72
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,800
孩子 你们看起来有区别
Well, boys, you look different

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,840
是因为在我怀你的时候
because when I was pregnant with you,

74
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,070
我只吃香草冰激凌
I only ate vanilla ice cream.

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,050
当我怀你的时候
And when I was pregnant with you,

76
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,190
你能猜出我吃的是什么冰激凌?
can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?

77
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,270
- 咖啡的? - 不是的 詹姆士
- Coffee? - No, James,

78
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,600
我吃的是巧克力冰淇凌
I ate chocolate ice cream.

79
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,400
但是我在怀你们俩的时候 确实喝了很多咖啡
But  I did drink tons of coffee when I was pregnant with both of you.

80
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,550
没有咖啡怎么能抽烟
Can't smoke without my coffee.

81
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,350
我不知道 这就是 那种让人搞不清的事
I don't know, boys, I guess it's just one of those things.

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,740
别再问我了!
Stop asking me!

83
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:44,630
你们知道你们是什么吗? 你们是两个小种族歧视者!
You know what you two are? You're little racists!

84
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,580
你们两个今晚想做点什么?
So what are you guys gonna do tonight?

85
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,140
我告诉你詹姆士今晚要做什么
I'll tell you what James is gonna do.

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,160
他要做被你忽视的事情
He's gonna do the job you've been neglecting.

87
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,060
就和往常一样 他会做得比你更好
And, as always, he'll do it a lot better than you ever did.

88
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,350
泰德...
Ted...

89
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,470
詹姆斯现在是我的托
James is my wingman now.

90
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,400
好吧
Okay.

91
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,670
上次詹姆士来的时候 巴尼被抽了一次巴掌
Last time James was in town, Barney got slapped once,

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,350
和别人上了两次床……
lucky twice, and...

93
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,200
你最后睡在了谁的浴缸里?
whose penthouse hot tub did you end up in?

94
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,580
公众人物 我们要为他保密
Ah, public figure, confidentiality agreement.

95
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,900
但我可以说另一个秘密
But I will say this:

96
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,540
他的背毛比任何
way more back hair than any guy

97
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,700
可以支付激光除毛的人都多
who can afford laser hair removal should have.

98
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,840
还有一次他们和一对兄妹上了床
And then there was the time they scored the brother/sister combo.

99
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,440
这是我们自从看唐尼和玛丽节目以来
It was everything we ever dreamed of

100
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,270
一直拥有的梦想
when watching Donnie and Marie.

101
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,170
她有点乡村气息 （这是唐尼和玛丽节目歌曲的歌词）
She was a little bit country.

102
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,950
他有点对黑人男人情有独钟
He was a little bit way into black guys.

103
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,420
巴尼和詹姆士在一起 组成了致命联合
Yeah, Barney and James together was a lethal combination.

104
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,830
因为两人的目标不同
Since there was never any crossover in targets,

105
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,950
所以詹姆士总是帮助巴尼
James was always there for Barney with the assist.

106
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,470
哇 你的围巾...
Whoa. Your scarf...

107
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,390
太有震撼力了!
it is fierce!

108
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,980
谢谢 H&M牌的 (瑞典顶级品牌H&M)
Thanks. H & M.

109
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,500
真的? 我可没看出来
What? I would never know,

110
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,870
因为它太热辣了 我的眼睛都要熔化了 我看不见了
'cause it is so hot that my eyes are melting. Oh, I can't see.

111
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,450
说到这里  你知道什么东西
Hey! You know, speaking of things

112
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,250
围着你会让你看起来更加美丽?
that would look good wrapped around you,

113
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,680
你认识我不是 同性恋的兄弟巴尼?
have you met my straight brother, Barney?

114
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,160
他可是很出... 等一下...色的 哦!
Oh, he is fab-- don't you go nowhere-- "ulous." Okay?

115
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,650
巴尼总是还詹姆士这个人情
And  Barney always returned the favor.

116
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,210
救命啊 他停止呼吸了
Help, I don't think he's breathing.

117
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,940
有人会人工呼吸吗?
Does anyone know mouth-to-mouth?

118
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,940
哦   天啊!我会!
Oh, my God, I do!

119
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,800
呃   好 换你来怎么样?
Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?

120
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,850
你能来我真是太高兴了!
Oh, man, I am so excited that you're here!

121
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,980
我已经很久没有和
It has been forever since I have been around anyone

122
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,640
任何玩得开的人一起玩了
even remotely fun.

123
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,590
我这么说是想伤你们的感情
Uh, yes offense.

124
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,330
今晚你们和我俩一起出去玩 是不?
You guys are still going out with us tonight, right?

125
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,940
- 不去 - 詹姆士
- No. - Jammies.

126
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,310
今晚? 已经九点多了...
Tonight? It's after 9:00 and...

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,340
而且我刚喝完热呼呼的汤
I have warm soup belly.

128
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,340
不...不...伙计们...
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Guys...

129
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,130
你们都是年轻有魅力的人
you are young, attractive people here

130
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,620
在地球上这个最伟大的城市
in the greatest city on earth.

131
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,090
而在那个没人 爱搭理的怀俄明州里的
There are boys and girls

132
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,860
男男女女做梦都想到这个城市
in Nobody Cares, Wyoming, wishing they could be here.

133
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,150
但是他们只能在租来的 地下室里喝烂酒
But instead, they are in someone's basement drinking bad malt liquor,

134
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,860
考虑这个周六晚上是
debating whether or not they're going to spend their Saturday night

135
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,390
在商店的停车厂
in the parking lot of the feed store

136
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,690
还是在某个家伙的地下室里度过
or in some other dude's basement.

137
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,390
就冲这个  你们应该站起来
You owe it to them to rise up

138
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,680
扭着你们的懒屁股 穿上火辣的衣服
and shimmy your lazy asses into something hot,

139
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,860
然后出去实现他们的梦想!
and  you go out there and you live their dream!

140
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,630
- 跟我说"嘿 耶!" - 嘿 耶!
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"? - Hell, yeah!

141
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,210
- 跟我说"嘿 耶!" - 嘿 耶!
- Can I get a "hell, yeah"? - Hell, yeah!

142
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,880
- 跟我说"喔-喔!" - 喔-喔!
- Can I get a "woo-woo"? - Woo-woo!

143
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,030
我们为了怀俄明州 而狂欢吧! 走吧!
Go do it for Wyoming! Yes!

144
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,810
上帝在此见证!
Testify!

145
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,000
那晚 巴尼的愿望实现了
So that night, Barney got his wish.

146
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,150
我们都出门狂欢了
We all went out.

147
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,660
老爸我回来了!
Daddy's home!

148
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,270
噎!
Yeah.

149
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,630
怎么样  兄弟  你看上哪位了?
All right, bro. What do you like?

150
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,810
那个穿着超级紧身黑色T恤的人如何?
Guy in super tight black T?

151
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,500
肌肉黑男?
Super tight black guy?

152
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,090
长的和T先生一样的家伙?
Guy who looks like Mr. T?

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,450
第一位可以  第二位可以  第三位嘛... 喝完两杯马提尼后再问我
Mmm, yes, yes, and... talk to me after two martinis.

154
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,510
咱们再帮你看看 我的兄弟
Let's focus on you, my man.

155
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,600
我今天有点懒
I'm feeling lazy.

156
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,320
那个在喝巧克力鸡尾酒的女孩怎么样?
How 'bout girl with the chocolatini?

157
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,260
背后有纹身
Oh... boom, back tattoo.

158
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,980
用英雄救美方案?
Hero and the pig?

159
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,900
- 咱们上 - 开演
- Let's ride. - Fo' 'sho.

160
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,100
哎呀  宝贝  好漂亮的风骚章!
Damn baby, nice tramp stamp!

161
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,770
- 滚开 你这个死流氓! - 喂! 喂!
- Get off me, you pig! - Hey! Hey!

162
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,960
她的纹身不是用来邀请别人来摸她的
Her body art is not an invitation to grope her,

163
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,060
而是来表达她的内涵的
it's an expression of her inner self.

164
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:03,100
我相信她的内心世界 确实就像一个花丛中的海豚 (纹身图案)
I'm sure, in many ways, she is the dolphin encircled by flowers.

165
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,630
- 干什么? 干什么? - 怎么? 怎么?
- What? What? - What? What?

166
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,370
算了
Cool.

167
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,280
下次他再烦你 你就告诉我
Let me know if he bothers you again.

168
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,820
谢谢 你应该留下...以防万一
Thanks. You should stay close... just in case.

169
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,720
如果能让你觉得更放心的话
Sure. If it'll make you feel safer.

170
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,230
我叫巴尼
I'm Barney.

171
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,700
孩子们 在一个嘈杂拥挤的酒吧里
Now, kids, when you're out at a noisy, crowded bar,

172
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,580
很容易就能分辨出单身一族
you can always tell the difference between the singles

173
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,160
和情侣之间的区别
and the couples.

174
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,540
只要找到几个特征就行了
You just have to look for the signs.

175
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,350
- 分别行动! - 火辣的目标
- Break. - Boiling hot.

176
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,620
单身一族总是站着 为的是行动方便点
Singles stay on their feet for maneuverability.

177
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,080
- 嘿 - 嗨 你好吗?
- Hey! - Hi, how are ya?

178
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,830
你认识我兄弟?
Have you met my brother?

179
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,770
你好 来喝一杯
Oh, hello. Have a drink.

180
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,460
很高兴认识你
Nice to meet ya.

181
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,950
而情侣呢 光是走出家门 就已经让他们精疲力尽了
Couples, exhausted by the sheer act of leaving the house,

182
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,370
一到酒吧就 一个劲儿地找位子坐
are obsessed with finding a place to sit down.

183
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,560
还有许多其他的特征
There are a lot of other indicators, too.

184
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,740
比如说  酒精的选择
From choice of social lubricant...

185
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,560
还有基本的身体语言
...to basic body language.

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,290
总言而知  有很多方法可以来判断
But the point is, there are many ways to tell

187
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,420
一个人属于精神抖擞的单身一族
whether someone has Single Stamina

188
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,860
还是昏迷不醒的情侣一派
or Couples Coma.

189
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,450
我因该穿运动鞋来
I wish I would've worn sneakers.

190
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,300
我刚从一个 又胖毛又多的家伙那逃出来
I just got finished running from some fat, hairy guy

191
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,770
他的小弟弟想从他的皮裤子里 钻出来和我打招呼
who was periscoping out of his pleather pants.

192
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,310
门儿都没有!
Permission to come aboard denied.

193
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,280
我想念我的睡衣
I miss my jammies.

194
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,590
我不相信我竟然穿上了胸罩
I can't believe I wore a bra for this.

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,590
胸罩烦死人了 裹得紧紧的  太不自然了
Bras suck. They're so confining and unnatural.

196
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,790
里面挤得就像一个动物园
Yeah, they're like a boobie zoo.

197
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,350
那你就把胸罩脱掉吧 让里面的小崽崽轻松一下
Well, why don't you take it off then and let those puppies breathe?

198
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,490
别费力气了  你还是把口水 流在别的女人身上吧!
Oh, please go sweat on someone else.

199
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

200
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,030
可怜的家伙?我的乳房更可怜
Poor guy? Poor my boobs.

201
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,940
一个男人要鼓足很大的勇气 去接近一个女孩子
Well, it takes a lot of guts to approach a girl

202
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,450
而你却中伤了他
and you just crushed him.

203
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,810
是的  是的 他看起来很受打击
Oh, yeah, yeah. He looks all broken up inside.

204
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,620
你们男人永远无法体会一个女孩
Whatever, you guys have no idea what it's like

205
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,220
被别人死缠烂打地 追着的感觉是什么样
to be on the receiving end.

206
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,760
我好可怜 我是个漂亮的女孩
"Oh, poor me. I'm a pretty girl

207
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,740
大家都想给我买酒
and everybody everywhere wants to buy me drinks

208
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,320
然后和我上床
and have sex with me."

209
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,210
哇
Waa.

210
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,100
我好可怜 我可以喝 粉红色的   美味的
"Oh, poor me. I get to order yummy, pink drinks

211
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,150
上面带大块果粒的
with chunks of real fruit that guys secretly like,

212
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,920
男生都暗地想喝却又怕 被嘲笑而不敢喝的鸡尾酒
but can't order because they'll be made fun of."

213
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,620
- 老兄 - 好喝极了
-  Dude. - They're delicious!

214
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,150
打扰以下  和我来喝一杯?
Excuse me. Join me in a shot?

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,070
不了  我已经喝的够多的了
Oh, no thanks. I've had enough.

216
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,980
他太注重身材了
He's too in shape,

217
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,050
跟他约会的话 一晚上都会谈论身体脂肪含量的
we'd spend all night talking about his body fat content.

218
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,900
失陪片刻
Now, if you'll excuse me,

219
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,750
我要去喝一杯 美味的上面带大块果粒的饮料...
I'm gonna go have a yummy, pink drink with fruit in it...

220
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,340
因为我是同性恋 所以没有人会笑话我
because I can.

221
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,920
你们知道吗 这是詹姆斯今天晚上
You know, that was, like, the third hot guy

222
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,630
拒绝的第三个帅哥
that James blew off tonight.

223
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,060
对啊  他不喝别人喝酒 还打呵欠
Yeah, he's turning down shots, he's yawning,

224
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,820
还抱怨脚疼
he's whining about his feet.

225
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,580
他和我们一样糟糕
He's as bad as we are.

226
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,770
是这么回事
He is.

227
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,430
等等 他和我们一模一样 你们觉得詹姆士...
Wait, he's exactly as bad as we are. You guys don't think that James is...

228
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,810
是不是有了男朋友?
in a relationship?

229
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,510
不 这不可能 他跟巴尼一样花心
No. There's no way. He's Barney's brother.

230
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,090
快看
Look at that.

231
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,570
他在发短信!
He's texting!

232
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,280
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

233
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,980
他在热恋中
He is in a couple.

234
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,000
这会让巴尼疯掉的
This is gonna kill Barney.

235
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:52,510
什么事会让我疯掉?
What's gonna kill me?

236
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,330
到底怎么了?
What's going on?

237
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,300
巴...巴尼?
B-Barney?

238
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,570
你有没有注意到... 詹姆士有些不同寻常?
Have you noticed anything... different about James?

239
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,640
没有
No.

240
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,810
他刚做过美容  所以容光焕发
I mean, he's glowing from his peel, if that's what you mean.

241
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,100
我们有理由相信詹姆士正在...
We have reason to believe that James is, uh,

242
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,610
向你隐瞒着一些东西
maybe hiding something from you.

243
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,960
我知道你也许不喜欢听这些 但是...
I-I know you're not gonna like hearing this, but...

244
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,410
巴尼...
Barney...

245
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,620
你的兄弟现在...
your brother is...

246
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,240
变得专一了
monogamous.

247
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,530
这太荒谬了!
That's ridiculous!

248
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,130
就算他今天有点死气沉沉的
Just because he's a little sleepy,

249
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,350
没有和别人在厕所的小隔间里做爱!
and he hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall...

250
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,690
他没有和别人在厕所的小隔间里做爱?
He hasn't had sex with anyone in a bathroom stall.

251
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,020
巴尼...
And, Barney...

252
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,850
我并不想告诉你这个 但是...
I hate to be the one to tell you this, but...

253
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,300
他在发短信
he's texting.

254
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,650
不...他...不!
No, he... No!

255
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,130
这... 不可能
That... is impossible.

256
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,320
借过... 借过... 借过...
Excuse... Excuse... Ex...

257
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,740
嗨 兄弟
Hey, bro.

258
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,440
不要转移话题
Don't change the subject.

259
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,630
让我看看你的手机
Let me see your phone.

260
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,390
为什么?
Why?

261
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,090
我就是想看看 你的手机  让我看看
I just want to see your phone. Let me see your phone.

262
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,280
这只不过是部手机 有什么好看的?
No, it's just a phone. It's just a phone!

263
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,510
它有网络功能  还可以照像
And it's got Internet access, and it's got a camera on it,

264
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,270
你可以用它上网  干什么都行
and you can surf the Web and do the whole thing.

265
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,830
现在的高科技真是太惊人了
It's so amazing how far technology has come.

266
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,910
你的手机有什么功能?
What kind of phone do you have?

267
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,100
我有...
I got...

268
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,230
这是谁?
Who is this?

269
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,590
你的回答最好是 "我不记得这个人的名字"
And the answer better be: "I don't remember his name."

270
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:25,870
这是汤姆
That is Tom.

271
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,550
他是我的未婚夫
And he's my fianc?

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,070
嗨!
Hey.

273
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,390
我不支持
I don't support this.

274
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,540
你不支持同性恋结婚?
Gay marriage?

275
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,220
不光是同性恋结婚 我不支持结婚!
Not gay marriage-- marriage!

276
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,830
你怎么能这样做呢?
How can you do this?

277
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,750
我们是在同一个家庭里长大的 我们被灌输了同样的价值观
We were raised in the same house, with the same values!

278
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,200
相信我  我也挣扎了很久
Believe me, I fought this for a long time.

279
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,260
这种事情羞死人了
Come on, it's embarrassing.

280
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,760
开始的时候 这种事情对于我来说也很奇怪
Look, this felt unnatural to me, too, at first.

281
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,180
但是我坠入了爱河
But I fell in love.

282
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,820
我和汤姆意识到 我们不能和爱情作对
And Tom and I realized you can't fight love.

283
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,040
我的天啊
Oh, God.

284
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,510
你们俩就在一起做这个吗? 你们坐在家里
Is that what you two do together? You sit around the house

285
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,230
谈情说爱? 我想... 我马上就要呕出来了
and talk about love? I think... I'm gonna be sick.

286
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,960
好吧  好吧  听着
Okay, okay, look,

287
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,640
你要好好地考虑一下 好吗?
I need you to wrap your head around this, okay?

288
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,600
因为这件事已成定局
Because it is happening.

289
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,600
并且我希望你做我的伴郎
And I want you to be my best man.

290
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,290
什么? 没门
What? No way.

291
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,920
我很遗憾你是这么想的
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

292
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:35,220
我希望你能改变主意
I hope you change your mind.

293
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,700
两瓶啤酒 一杯shot (一种混合烈酒)
Two  beers, one shot.

294
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,210
简直就跟传染病一样
Oh, it's a freaking epidemic.

295
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,970
亲爱的!这个是给我作的?
Oh, sweetie! Did you make that for me?

296
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,800
是的
Yes.

297
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,340
龙虾大餐 史坦顿岛 谁去?
Clam Bake. Staten Island. Who's in?

298
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,910
算了 已经猜到你们不会去
Okay, I didn't have high hopes for that one.

299
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,810
好吧 这是我的问题
Okay, here's my thing.

300
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,470
如果同性恋开始结婚
If gay guys start getting married,

301
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,790
那全世界的人都会想结婚
then suddenly the whole world's gonna be doing it.

302
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
这就是他们的影响 他们起头
That's how it works. They start something,

303
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,110
然后6个月以后人们都跟着做
then six months later, everyone follows.

304
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,690
就像现在每个人都开始护理指甲
Like now everyone gets manicures.

305
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,050
我不护理指甲
I don't get manicures.

306
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,190
好吧  比如说... 比如说...去胸毛
Okay, then like how... Like getting your chest waxed.

307
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,880
你去胸毛?
You get your chest waxed?

308
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,620
我只是打个比方!
You know what I mean!

309
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,560
同性恋婚姻会让单身
Gay marriage is going to cause single life,

310
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,750
这种生活方式灭亡的
as we know it, to die out.

311
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,220
而美国家庭关系会因此而牢固不少
Think of how the American family will be strengthened.

312
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,510
我知道你很生气 但是你应该接受事实
Barney, I'm sorry you're upset, but you got to suck it up

313
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,640
要像一个男人一样来对待这个事情
and be a man about this.

314
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,690
不
No.

315
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,410
一直都是我和他一起疯狂玩乐
It's always been me and him together, being awesome,

316
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,860
当你们成双结对
while the rest of you walked two-by-two

317
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,640
走入没有性生活的无聊二人世界
onto your ark of sexless boredom.

318
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,480
即使詹姆士要结婚了
Just because James is getting married

319
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,290
这并不意味着将有什么变化
doesn't mean things are going to change.

320
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,620
好像你们从未发生过变化
Yeah. Like things haven't changed with you people.

321
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,960
我妹妹和一个 我不喜欢的家伙结婚了
Look, my sister married a guy I didn't like.

322
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,390
凉鞋配短袜  有没有搞错?
Sandals and socks-- come on, buddy.

323
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,550
但是我还是 带她出去为她庆祝
But I took her out, we celebrated.

324
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,920
应为那是我应该做的事情
It was the right thing to do.

325
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,680
你应该支持詹姆斯
You got to support him.

326
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,490
你说的对  泰德
You're right, Ted.

327
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,340
这正好是庆祝的理由
This is a cause for celebration.

328
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,760
我们应该带他出去好好地庆祝一下
We need to take him out and celebrate the commitment

329
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,070
他和汤姆即将走进婚姻的殿堂
he and Tom are about to make.

330
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,680
啊...这就是
Yeah. This is where we're celebrating

331
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,210
庆祝我和汤姆走进婚姻殿堂的地方?
the commitment that Tom and I are about to make?

332
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,540
什么?对呀!
What? Yeah!

333
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,760
那个笼子象征着婚姻
See, that cage represents your commitment.

334
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,990
我的天啊 自由的味道从来没有这么甜美过
Oh, my God. Freedom has never tasted so delicious.

335
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,263
Hey.

336
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,920
你经常健身?
You work out?

337
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,360
是的
I do.

338
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,160
你竟然注意到了!
And thank you for noticing.

339
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,380
你的体格也很健壮
You're obviously in very good shape yourself.

340
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,950
是的  我一直在努力健身
Well, I try.

341
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,560
那么你想跳支舞吗?
So you want to dance?

342
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,280
你知道吗? 你邀请我 我很开心
You know what? I'm very flattered, and, objectively,

343
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,460
你很有吸引力 但是这是我的未婚妻
you're a very attractive man, but this is actually my fiance.

344
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,120
对不起  其实我是 看见你在喝这种饮料所以我...
I'm sorry. You know, I saw your drink and I...

345
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,980
不 不 这个饮料不是我的 是她的...
No, no, this isn't my drink. This is hers.

346
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,840
不  这才是我的
No, it isn't.

347
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,700
随便怎么样吧
Whatever.

348
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,020
你呢?
How 'bout you?

349
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,590
我也是个异性恋者
Oh, I'm straight, too.

350
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,540
但是谢谢你在 我身上浪费的时间
But I thank you for your time,

351
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,540
谢谢你对我的身体感兴趣
and I appreciate your interest in my body.

352
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,780
你们看到了没?
You see that?

353
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,820
有人搭讪并不像你们说的那么糟糕
Being hit on doesn't have to be terrible.

354
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,000
而且对方离开的时候 都没有受到伤害
I feel flattered, and everyone left with their dignity.

355
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,320
我很喜欢你的毛衣
Hey, I really like your sweater.

356
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,080
你真的喜欢?
Wow. You actually do, don't you?

357
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,530
你不是想看 我的胸部或别的什么
You're not checking out my boobs or anything.

358
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,870
我的名字叫Gay・肯 你觉得呢?
My name's Gay Ken, what do you think?

359
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,230
我爱这个地方! 我们一起来跳舞!
I love this place! Let's dance!

360
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
- 而且不会被骚扰! - 谢谢
- And not be groped! - Whoo! Thank you.

361
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,930
- 好热辣! - 谢谢你!
- Damn. - Thank you!

362
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,020
- 我们太抢手了 - 毫无疑问!
- We're hot. - Totally.

363
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,200
然后汤姆对那个商人说
And then Tom says to the dealer

364
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,000
这个乔治亚手制时钟表有些小瑕疵
that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner.

365
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,180
就这样我们 以半价买了下来  你猜怎么?!
Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?!

366
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,460
其实我们骗他的!
Bam!

367
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,220
看来你们在手工艺展览会上淘到宝了
Sounds like you really rocked that arts and crafts fair.

368
00:16:01,236 --> 00:16:02,620
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

369
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,510
能和你讲这些事情
Hey, oh, my God. This is so liberating,

370
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,700
我心里感觉舒坦了许多
being able to talk about this to you.

371
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,300
我真是迫不及待地想 介绍汤姆给你认识
I cannot wait for you to meet Tom.

372
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,830
我也迫不及待地 想介绍我的朋友...
And I cannot wait for you to meet my good friend...

373
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,230
就是他
this guy.

374
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,640
打扰一下  你知道谁愿意
Excuse me, do you know anyone who would like to buy

375
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,650
和我强壮的 幽默的 慷慨的兄弟喝上一杯?
my incredibly muscular, fun, large-handed brother a drink?

376
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,620
哎哎哎!今天你是主角 巴尼
Eh, eh, eh, let's focus on you, Barnaby. Okay.

377
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,780
我注意到一群女人因为在同性恋酒舞厅
All right. I spy a group of women who have let their defenses down

378
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,610
而卸下了防卫
because they are in a gay club.

379
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,200
你看到那边那个小妞了?
You see that chick right there?

380
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,640
她看起来会喜欢 运动代理商或者踢足球的男人
She looks like she'd fall for sports agent and football player.

381
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,020
好的  我去试试
Okay, I'm in.

382
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,550
这次我是当英雄还是流氓?
Which one am I?

383
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,020
拜托
Please.

384
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,830
他很害羞 喜欢网球和巴西 而且...
He's very shy, loves tennis and Brazil, and drops his pants

385
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,440
三杯马提尼酒后就是你的人了 快上吧!  伙计  快点!
after three dirty martinis. Now go, man, go!

386
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,100
我从来没有 想到过巴尼也会这么脆弱
I just never thought I'd see Barney so vulnerable.

387
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,870
我想没有人喜欢孤零零地 一个人度过一生的感觉
Well, I guess no one wants to feel like they're going through the world alone.

388
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,630
看我夹在一个美味的三明治的中间!
Look at me, in a yummy sandwich!

389
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,780
我们现在正忙着呢 所以...
Okay, we're actually right in the middle of something right now, so...

390
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,640
那我也和你们一起"忙"吧!怎么样?
Ooh, I know what I want to be in the middle of. Thoughts?

391
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,040
难道两个异性恋男人就不能 来同性恋酒吧?
God, can't two straight guys come to a gay dance club,

392
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,790
听听音乐  讨论些问题 而不被人打扰?
enjoy some techno and good conversation without being bothered?

393
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,340
怎么样?还是在 享受被男人追捧的感觉?
How's it going, guys? Still enjoying the attentions of men?

394
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,180
刚才那人是在十分钟内 第八个跟我们搭讪的
That's like the eighth guy who's hit on us in ten minutes.

395
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,650
傻小子一直对 我的裤子含情脉脉
It's  like, hello, my eyes are up here.

396
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,110
而且来的都不是帅哥
And it's never the hot ones.

397
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,440
都是些没人要的家伙 真扫兴!
It's always the losers. Bums me out!

398
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,000
看起来他们有所领悟
Looks like the boys learned their lesson.

399
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,630
你是不是很希望有人跟你搭讪?
Do you totally miss being hit on?

400
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,440
对啊! 我们去找个体育酒吧 (体育酒吧里一般都是异性恋男人）
Oh, totally. Let's go find a sports bar.

401
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,910
詹姆士  你喜欢手工艺不是吗?
James, James, since you like arts and crafts,

402
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,530
看看查尔斯用樱桃枝打出的蝴蝶结
look at what Charles here made with cherry stems.

403
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,420
他是用舌头做的
He did it with his tongue.

404
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,630
没错
Yeah.

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,350
巴尼
Barney.

406
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,640
把你的号码输进我兄弟的手机里
So, Charles, why don't you put your number in my brother's phone,

407
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,860
等他心情好点的时候...
and once he's in a funner mood...

408
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,710
巴尼 我不想要他的号码
Barney, Barney, I don't want his number.

409
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,530
谁的号码我都不要 听见了吗?
I don't want anyone's number, okay?

410
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,040
我就要结婚了
I'm getting married.

411
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,570
Wow.

412
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,740
- 祝你们好运 - 谢谢
- Best of luck to you both. - Thank you.

413
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,320
我的号码留里面了
My number's in here.

414
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,070
我是一个非常谨慎的人
I'm very discreet.

415
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,170
好吧  好吧   打扰一下
Okay, okay, excuse me.

416
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,920
巴尼  家庭会议
Barney, family talk.

417
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,090
兄弟  你不要这么做了好不好?
Okay, dude, you have got to stop this, okay?

418
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,050
我知道我要结婚的 这个事实对你的生活方式产生了威胁
I know that my getting married is threatening to your way of life...

419
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,590
哦?这只是我的生活方式?
Oh, so now it's my way of life?

420
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,780
我以为这是我们共同的生活方式
I thought it was our way of life.

421
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,000
你完全了背弃了我们的生活方式
You've completely turned your back on it.

422
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,720
看看你  你甚至没有穿西装
Look at you, not even suited up.

423
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,070
你还记得我们 为什么而穿西装吗  詹姆士?
Do you remember why we suit up, James?

424
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,300
泡马子
To get laid.

425
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,360
是为了让别人知道我们与众不同
To show people that we are different

426
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,800
为了和数以百万 穿着T恤衫和牛仔的小子区别开来
from the millions of T-shirt and jeans lemmings out there.

427
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,400
西装证明我们不可蔑视的力量
The suit shows that we are a force to be reckoned with,

428
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,940
我们是两个人的军队 有自己的准则
a two-person army that plays by its own rules.

429
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,460
但是你脱下了制服 你投靠了敌人
But you've taken off the uniform, you've crossed enemy lines,

430
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,640
而且你抛弃了我
and you've abandoned me.

431
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,010
我是不会让你这样做的
Well, I'm not gonna let you do that.

432
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,700
现在摆脱你这场愚蠢的婚姻还不迟!
It's not too late to back out of this stupid marriage thing!

433
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,370
你不需结婚 兄弟!
You don't have to do this, bro!

434
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,640
- 我需要 - 为什么?!
- Yes, I do. - Why?!

435
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,260
因为汤姆和我想要一个孩子
Because Tom and I are gonna have a baby.

436
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,310
什么? 会有一个孩子?
What? There's gonna be a baby?

437
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,620
是的  我们打算收养一个孩子
Yes. We're adopting.

438
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,340
天啊  我要当叔叔了?
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?

439
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,240
你一辈子都会是
For the rest of your life.

440
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,210
这就是巴尼怎么变成了巴尼叔叔
And that's how Barney became Uncle Barney.

441
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,230
一年以后  在詹姆士的婚礼上
A year later, at James's wedding,

442
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,160
这天是巴尼最自豪的一天
Barney could not have been more proud.

443
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,840
向詹姆士和汤姆致敬
To James and Tom.

444
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,420
希望你们新婚快乐长命百岁
May you have a long and happy life together.

445
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:18,640
并且希望我的皮肤和性欲 永远都会像年轻小伙一样好
And may I always have the skin and libido of a much younger man.

446
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,220
- 干杯 - 干杯
- Cheers. - Cheers.

447
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,400
讲的不错
Nice one.

448
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,810
谢谢  我决定不去讲 詹姆斯大学时代是个异性恋
Thanks. I decided to leave out the hetero college phase.

449
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,230
没有人想听这个
No one wants to hear about that.

450
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,620
你的演讲完美极了
It was perfect.

451
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,870
汤姆的爸爸甚至都感动得搞哭了
You even made Tom's dad cry.

452
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,830
或者也许是因为他是共和党人所以被气哭的 (美国共和党不支持同性恋婚姻)
Might have been doing that because he's a Republican.

453
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,390
哇!
Whoa.

454
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,880
都九点了
It's 9:00.

455
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,360
我们该回去了 你们要搭个顺风车?
We should be getting back. You guys want to split a cab?

456
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,260
不了  我想再多呆会
Uh, no, I think I'm gonna stay a little bit longer.

457
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,360
我也是  我还不太累
Yeah, me, too. I'm not tired at all.

458
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,670
时间很晚了 我要带老婆回家了
All right, well, it's getting late. Got to get the wife home.

459
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,020
不要那么叫我 听起来好像我很胖
Oh, stop calling me that. It makes me sound fat.

460
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,850
简直就跟传染病一样
Ugh, it's a freaking epidemic.

461
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,010
- 我可以来看看小家伙? - 当然
- May I? - Yeah.

462
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,750
小家伙
Hey, buddy.

463
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,890
你的父母结婚了
Your parents are married.

464
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:20,800
你好好听我说
Now, listen, you.

465
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,340
不要因为你被已婚父母抚养
Just because you're being raised by married people

466
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,860
而选择他们的生活方式
doesn't mean you have to choose that lifestyle.

467
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,000
来　支持一下
High-five.

468
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,980
幸运的是 你有我
Luckily, you got me.

469
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,650
20年零六个月以后你就21岁了
In 20 and a half years, you'll be 21,

470
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,510
到那时我就...
and I will be...

471
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,270
我还没有决定那时候我多大岁数
Well, I haven't decided how old I'll be yet.

472
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,630
但是我们将是称兄道弟的侄子和叔叔
But we are gonna bro out, uncle and nephew style.

473
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,310
你要跟着我
Stick with me, kid.

474
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,360
我来教你怎么生活
I am gonna teach you how to live.

475
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,510
顺便说一下  好挺的西装
Great suit, by the way.

476
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,560
谁最可爱?
Who is the cutest?

477
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,180
我真搞不懂
I don't get it.

478
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,290
十年级的时候 汤姆还喜欢我的大胸
Tom liked my breasts in tenth grade.

479
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,270
为什么他现在不喜欢了呢?
Why doesn't he like them now?

480
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,520
为什么?
Why?

481
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,760
罗莎  为什么总想得到 那些不可能得到的东西呢?
Rosa, why always be attracted to the unavailable ones?

482
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:21,040
为什么不接受 你很美丽的这个事实
Why not accept the fact that you're a beautiful woman

483
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,080
你是个值得别人去爱的女人
who is worthy of love?

484
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,370
我说这些你能勇敢地接受?
Are you brave enough to hear that?

485
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,600
你...
You...
