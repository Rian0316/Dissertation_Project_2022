1
00:00:03,456 --> 00:00:04,356
嘿
Hey.

2
00:00:04,357 --> 00:00:05,923
Hi 放映会怎么样啊?
Hi, how was the screening?

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,725
{\an8}著名黑人平权活动家

4
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,725
这个嘛 Sheldon引用了Rosa Parks的例子
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

5
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,227
让一个插队的人自惭形秽
to make somebody who cut the line feel bad,

6
00:00:10,229 --> 00:00:14,632
但只有白人觉得愧疚罢了
but only the white people felt bad.

7
00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,834
唉 我真不该给他买那本介绍
Ugh, I should've never bought him that coloring book

8
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:19,603
黑人历史月的填色簿的
that explains Black History Month.

9
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,038
你和我妈妈相处得怎么样?
How'd it go with my mother?

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,073
刚开始的时候是有点不顺
Uh, you know, it started a little rocky,

11
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:24,975
但我想我们后来还是达成共识了
but I think we got to a good place.

12
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,010
哇哦
Wow.

13
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,278
不错啊
Well done.

14
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,479
之后我送她回酒店的时候
Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel,

15
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,480
她还给了我一个拥抱呢
she even gave me a hug.

16
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:32,983
她是不是觉得你噎住了还是...
Did she think you were choking or...

17
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,418
不好意思 这真是太棒了
I'm sorry, that's great.

18
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,153
谢谢你花时间来陪她
Thank you for spending time with her.

19
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,621
别客气
No problem.

20
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:39,089
对了
Um, so listen,

21
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,892
我不知道你下周末有没有什么计划
I don't know if you have any plans next weekend,

22
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:43,694
但我答应了你母亲
but I kind of promised your mom

23
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:45,195
要再举行一次婚礼仪式
we'd have another wedding ceremony

24
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:47,298
这一次她就能来参加了
so she could attend this time.

25
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,367
你是说我们要再结一次婚?
Wait, we're gonna get married again?

26
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:53,471
算是吧 但这一次我们可以叫上家人和朋友
Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family.

27
00:00:53,472 --> 00:00:56,173
真是一个拥抱带来的灾难啊
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.

28
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,373
别这样嘛 一定会很有趣的
Come on, it'll be fun,

29
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:59,008
你知道吗 我们第一次结婚没有邀请你妈妈
and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt

30
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,676
她真的很受伤
we didn't invite her to the first one.

31
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,077
站在我们的角度
Look, in our defense,

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,246
这是一时兴起决定去做的事情
it was kind of a spur of the moment thing,

33
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,382
而且我们不喜欢她
and also, we don't like her.

34
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:07,950
Leonard 她毕竟是你妈妈啊
Leonard, come on, she's your mom.

35
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:09,985
如果我们能做点什么让她开心的话
If we can do something to make her happy,

36
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,886
何乐而不为呢?
why wouldn't we?

37
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:12,154
我不是刚刚才说了原因吗
I just said why...

38
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,889
我们对她没爱啊
we don't like her.

39
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,191
那这样吧 别管她了
Hey, look, then forget about her,

40
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:16,358
就当是为了我们自己
let's do it for us.

41
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,693
我们不用搞得特别隆重正规
We could keep it small and informal.

42
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,161
这一次我们叫上我们的家人
This time we can invite our families.

43
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,496
你兄弟出狱了吗?
Is your brother out of prison?

44
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:22,665
监狱人满为患了 托福啊
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

45
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,768
我真希望我爸爸能来
I'd love it if my dad could come.

46
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,136
你一定要邀请他
Oh, you have to invite him.

47
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:28,604
自从他离婚以后我就没见过他了
I haven't seen him since the divorce.

48
00:01:28,606 --> 00:01:30,506
他像变了一个人一样
Oh, he's like a different man.

49
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,107
他的抽搐停止了
Oh. He stopped twitching,

50
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,577
我觉得他还长高了一尺半呢
and I think he grew an inch and a half.

51
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:36,478
那就这么说定了
Well, then it's settled.

52
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,813
好吧
Yay.

53
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:38,814
天哪
God.

54
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,982
真是太搞笑了
So funny.

55
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:42,418
我从没想过第二次结婚对象还是你这货
I never thought my second marriage would be to you!

56
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,756
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

57
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:51,093
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

58
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:52,695
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

59
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:55,264
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

60
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:57,933
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 *
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

61
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:00,603
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

62
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:02,504
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

这不是一次法律意义上的仪式
Okay, so it's not a legal ceremony,

68
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,368
这只是提供了一次机会
it's just a chance for us

69
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,970
让我们在重读誓言时能有你们的陪伴
to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it.

70
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,474
所以也就没有伴娘了?
So there's no maid of honor?

71
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,408
没有
No.

72
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,578
呵呵
Huh.

73
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,881
但假如我穿着一条紫色的缎子裙
But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress

74
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,217
戴着心形项链站在你旁边
with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you,

75
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,653
你也不能阻止我对吧?
you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?

76
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,656
当然不能了
I don't see how I could.

77
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,493
那我就大方地答应你吧
Then I graciously accept.

78
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,994
谁来主持呢?
Who's going to officiate?

79
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,696
我希望你能来主持
I was kind of hoping you would.

80
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:47,599
等等 那我现在只是个逊到爆的伴娘了吗?
Wait, now I'm just some lousy maid of honor?

81
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,269
嘿 好消息 我刚和我妈打完电话
Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother.

82
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,337
她要来参加你们的婚礼
She is coming to the wedding.

83
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,072
好吧 先别急
Okay, wait,

84
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,841
你邀请别人来参加我们的婚礼?
you're inviting people to our wedding?

85
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,745
是啊 我邀请别人来参加“我们的”婚礼
Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding.

86
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,012
我还顺便问了
Yeah, I've already asked

87
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,382
史蒂芬·霍金和小罗伯特唐尼
Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr.

88
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:04,983
不过你也不要抱太大希望 因为他真的很忙
And now, don't get your hopes up, 'cause he's pretty busy,

89
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,352
还有Erno Rubik
but Erno Rubik.

90
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,354
谁是Erno Rubik?
Who's Erno Rubik?

91
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,857
你真的不知道吗?
Seriously?

92
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,325
他可是发明魔方的人呢
He invented the Rubik's Cube.

93
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,460
好吧
Okay, fine,

94
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,129
但你为什么要请他来参加我们的婚礼?
but why would you invite him to our wedding?

95
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,431
因为除了他的名声和财富之外
Because, despite his fame and fortune,

96
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,933
他独行侠的身姿震慑了我
he strikes me as a lonely man.

97
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,136
你能为Leonard的妈妈
Well, it's very sweet

98
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,338
不怕麻烦地筹划这些事情真是周到
of you to go to all this trouble for Leonard's mother.

99
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,939
是啊 我这么做也是为了Leonard
Yeah, I'm also doing it for Leonard.

100
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,975
我想这对他们之间的关系会很有帮助
I think this could really help their relationship.

101
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,145
你怎么敢在征询我的意见之前就先邀请你爸爸!
How dare you invite your father without consulting me!

102
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:38,150
我很抱歉 但我觉得我不需要得到你的允许
Sorry, but I don't think I need your permission

103
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:40,285
才能邀请我的父亲参加我的婚礼
to have my father at my wedding.

104
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:42,821
你也知道我们的婚姻之所以结束是因为他有了外遇
You do understand our marriage ended because he had an affair.

105
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,889
我知道
I know,

106
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,957
外遇没有借口
and there's no excuse for that.

107
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,528
他说我冷漠 不近人情
He claimed I was cold, emasculating,

108
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,364
而且这么多年来从未对他产生过任何生理上的吸引
and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.

109
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:55,867
我错了 这段外遇确实事出有因啊
I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.

110
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,547
额滴神那
Oh, my God.

111
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:09,481
成功了
It's working.

112
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,049
你确定吗?
You sure?

113
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,083
看
Look.

114
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,785
这个系统正在维持自己的稳定性
The system is maintaining its own stability,

115
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:16,721
量子涡旋装置正在控制自己的方向
the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.

116
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,592
没错
You're right.

117
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:21,927
你明白这意味着什么的吧?
You realize what this means?

118
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,795
是啊
Yeah.

119
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,564
我明白
I do.

120
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:28,834
这证明了一个概念
It's proof of concept.

121
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:30,702
我们找到了可行的导航系统了
We've got a workable guidance system.

122
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,738
恭喜恭喜
Congratulations.

123
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,442
谢谢你!
Thanks!

124
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,178
嘿
Hey,

125
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,548
我刚刚受到了美国空军发来的邮件
I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force.

126
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,350
打开看看
Open it.

127
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,551
唔...
Hmm.

128
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,487
我们希望能在您空闲时尽快和您会面
"We request a meeting at your earliest convenience

129
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,288
商谈关于您的量子导航系统的
"regarding your quantum guidance system,

130
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,859
暂时性专利62/295118号
provisional patent 62/295118."

131
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,028
这还真是奇怪
That's weird.

132
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,233
我们被我们不知道的小窗秘密监视了吗?
Is there a window around here we don't know about?

133
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,468
我想这应该只是巧合
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

134
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,436
是啊
Yeah, of course.

135
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,904
不然还能是什么呢?
What else could it be?

136
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,941
兄弟们 我爱米国哦
Boy, do I love America.

137
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,145
谢谢你来接我
Thank you for picking me up.

138
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,615
别客气
Oh, you're welcome.

139
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,984
我是在和你的小女友说话呢
I was speaking to your young lady.

140
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,685
荣幸之至 Cooper夫人
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

141
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:21,953
叫我Mary就好了
Oh, please call me Mary.

142
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,389
好吧 Mary
Okay, Mary.

143
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:27,359
本宝宝对这称呼不爽
You know, that doesn't work for me,

144
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:29,594
还是叫Cooper夫人好了
let's stay with Mrs. Cooper.

145
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,563
Sheldon 别犯傻
Sheldon, don't be silly.

146
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,998
怎么了?
Wait, what?

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,160
在我了解你之前我都是这么叫你的
That's what I called you till I got to know you better.

148
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,771
Leonard和Penny能邀请我真是太贴心了
It was so nice of Leonard and Penny to invite me.

149
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,641
- 实际上 是我...  - 是啊
- Well, actually, I...  - It sure was.

150
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,644
Leonard在我心里一直有特殊的位置
I've always had a special place in my heart for Leonard.

151
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,279
照顾我的宝贝这么多年
Taking care of my baby all these years.

152
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,114
打断一下
Excuse me,

153
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,348
是我照顾他

不好意思
Oh, I'm so sorry.

175

我都看到我呼出来的气了
I think I can see my breath.

179
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,081
我们可以听到
We can hear you.

180

我们会消失
We disappear.

186
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,263
从地图上消失
Like off the map.

187
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,699
就像第四季之后的美国偶像冠军们一样
Like every American Idol winner since season four.

188
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,170
Howard 你反应过度啦
Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.

189
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,939
我有吗?
Am I?

190
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,142
有吗?
Am I?

191
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,811
要打赌吗 一些秘密工作者
Wha... what do you want to bet some black ops guy

192
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,813
正在重新打印我的高中年鉴

193
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,549
而我不在里面?
and I'm no longer in it?

194
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,752
象棋俱乐部的照片现在
That chess club picture is now

195
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,620
只剩下David Zimmerman和Elaine Cho了
just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.

196
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:39,557
我在浏览空军网站
Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force Web site,

197
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,692
给你发邮件的部门
and the department that e-mailed you

198
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:41,793
是负责收购的
is in charge of acquisitions.

199
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,395
也许他们只是想给你
So maybe they just want to give you

200
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:44,896
一些钱资助你的发明
a lot of money for your invention.

201
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,332
得了吧 他们不是这样的
Oh, please, that's not how it works.

202
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,934
你看过ET 阿凡达 侏罗纪公园
You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World.

203
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,239
军方只是出现然后接管
The military just shows up and takes over.

204
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,008
你知道这些不是纪录片吧?
You do realize those weren't documentaries, right?

205
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,212
你觉得这很好笑?
I'm sorry, you find this funny?

206
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,782
不是 我只是在想侏罗纪公园
No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World.

207
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,784
太恐怖了
Boy, that was terrible.

208
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:16,695
我们必须走楼梯
Oh, we have to use the stairs.

209
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,496
他们什么时候修电梯?
When are they gonna fix your elevator?

210
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,331
我不...随时都有可能
Uh... I don't... any day now.

211
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:24,102
走楼梯挺好
Well, the stairs are fine.

212
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:27,505
而且 你妈就在上面
Besides, your mother is up there.

213
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,341
我可能会心脏病发作 那就不用见她了
Maybe I'll have a heart attack and not have to see her.

214
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,313
我知道你和妈妈的关系
Hey, I, I know things are a little rough

215
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:36,681
有点僵
with you and Mom,

216
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,783
但我很高兴你来了
but I'm really glad you're here.

217
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,552
我也是
Me, too.

218
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,192
我不应该做血管成形术的 因为我感觉很好
I should have never had that angioplasty because I feel fine.

219
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,497
Penny很想见到你
Penny's really looking forward to seeing you.

220

256
00:10:42,063 --> 00:10:43,296
或者忽略它?
Ignore it?

257
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:44,597
你不能忽略它

这可不是通知
It's not that postcard that says it's time

259
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,800
你该去看牙医的明信片
to go back to the dentist.

如果我回复了 他们就会知道我收到了
if I respond, then they'll know I got it.

264
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:55,575
哥们
Oh, dude.

265
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,876
当你打开邮件的时候

他们可能正在通过

你们胡说八道够了吗?
Are you done with this nonsense?

00:11:09,023 --> 00:11:10,256
这不是胡说
It's not nonsense.

272
00:11:10,258 --> 00:11:12,191
美国军方就是这样的
This is how the U.S. military works.

273
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,759
如果是美国军方 
Oh, if it's even the U.S. military.

274
00:11:13,761 --> 00:11:16,629
可能是外国的军方假装成美国的
It could be foreign military pretending to be American.

275
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,031
你说得对 我们把引导系统交给他们
You're right. We turn our guidance system over to them,

276
00:11:19,033 --> 00:11:21,467
然后 他们就会使用它来对付我们
next thing we know, they're using it against us.

277
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:26,005
我也爱美国的敌人
I also love the enemies of America.

278
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,117
Penny 我希望我和Leonard他爸
Penny, I hope the example of my failed marriage

279
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,519
失败的婚姻不会
to Leonard's father doesn't discourage you

280
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:42,788
影响你们俩彼此许下的承诺
from the commitment you've made to one another.

281
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,958
当然不会
Oh, of course not.

282
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,029
尽管Alfred和我比你们俩经历的更多
Although Alfred and I had a lot more going for us than you two.

283
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,001
妈 留点话做祝酒词吧
Mom, please save something for the toast.

284
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,141
Alfred 你是做什么的?
So, Alfred, what is it that you do for a living?

285
00:12:02,143 --> 00:12:03,409
我是一个人类学家
Oh, I'm an anthropologist.

286
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:06,112
我研究古代的人和文化
I study ancient peoples and cultures.

287
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:08,114
天哪 就是追溯到大洪水时代

288
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:13,486
别笑 她不是开玩笑的
Don't laugh... she wasn't joking.

289
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,821
你玩手机吧
Play with your phone.

290
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,093
关于这一点
Well, on that note,

291
00:12:21,095 --> 00:12:23,963
在许多文化中有天启的洪水
there are many cultures that have an apocalyptic flood

292
00:12:23,965 --> 00:12:25,464
作为他们神话的一部分
as part of their mythology.

293
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,166
我没有神话
I don't have a mythology.

294
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,901
我说的是上帝的真言
I have the unerring Word of God.

295
00:12:28,903 --> 00:12:30,303
但是那很有意思
But that's very interesting.

296
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,570
噢
Oh.

297
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:33,673
我不是要贬损你的信仰
I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith.

298
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:35,441
其实我很崇尚它
Actually, I admire it.

299
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,709
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yes.

300
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,177
我自己也是不可知论者
Yes, I'm an agnostic myself,

301
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,479
我也向上帝祈求过很多次
but I have prayed, many times, to God,

302
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:44,016
把我老婆变成一根盐柱子
to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.

303
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,152
其实他做的也差不多呀

304
00:12:46,154 --> 00:12:48,187
他把她变成一大块冰块了
Turned her into a giant block of ice.

305
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:55,061

向学校里的什么人求助啊
you can go to for help.

307
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:57,897
你搞笑呢吧?
Are you kidding?

308
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,465
很可能就是他们
They're probably the ones who leaked it

309
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:01,267
首先泄露给军方的
to the military in the first place.

310
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:05,271
新闻第四频道的那个家伙呢?
What about the guy on the Channel Four News?

311
00:13:05,273 --> 00:13:07,473
就是"身边的第四频道"?
You know, "Four on Your Side"?

312
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,375
也许他可以在你身边支持你
Maybe he can be on your side.

313
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,145
我正被政府困扰
I'm being harassed by the government,

314
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:16,749
而不是要调查什么遛狗时的骗术
not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam.

315
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:19,585
别扯淡了!
Oh, stop!

316
00:13:19,587 --> 00:13:21,153
你知道怎么回事吗?
You know what's really happening?

317
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:22,688
你们看过的那些电影
All the movies you've watched,

318
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,090
电视剧 漫画书...
the TV shows, the comic books...

319
00:13:24,092 --> 00:13:25,791
那些东西扭曲了你们的想法
they've completely twisted your thinking.

320
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,360
没人跟踪你们 没人窃听你们
No one's after you, no one's listening to you,

321
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:29,395
根本就没人在乎你们
no one cares about you.

322
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,431
我还是宁可认为
I'd like to think

323
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,934
"身边的第四频道"是在乎我的
the "Four on Your Side" guy cares about me.

324
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,972
你看 Beverly 我了解你和Alfred之间
You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred

325
00:13:39,974 --> 00:13:42,675
有分歧 但是想一想
have your differences, but if you think about it,

326
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,277
如果没有和他结婚 就不会有Leonard了
if you hadn't married him, there'd be no Leonard.

327
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:47,980
还是不错的 对吧?
So that's good, right?

328
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:49,014
切
Eh.

329
00:13:54,722 --> 00:13:57,189
我们前面的是Howard吗?
Is that Howard in front of us?

330
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,758
也许吧
Oh, maybe.

331
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,659
开近一点
Get closer.

332
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:03,963
天啊
Oh, God.

333
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,766
我觉得有人在跟踪我们
I think someone's following us.

334
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:09,068
你在瞎扯
You're being ridiculous.

335
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,837
我没有瞎扯... 他就在我后面
I'm not being ridiculous... he's right on my tail.

336
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,807
在这里左转 看看会不会跟着我们
Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us.

337
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:17,977
为什么在这里转弯?
Well, why is he turning here?

338
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,845
餐厅在另一个方向 我也不知道
The restaurant's the other way. I don't know.

339
00:14:19,847 --> 00:14:22,214
他有查路况的手机软件 也许前面有事故
He uses that traffic app. Maybe there's an accident.

340
00:14:22,216 --> 00:14:23,716
那就跟着他
Oh, so follow him.

341
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:27,520
别啊!
Oh, no!

342
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,524
我就说!
I told you!

343
00:14:31,526 --> 00:14:34,126
也许只是碰巧
It's probably just a coincidence.

344
00:14:34,128 --> 00:14:36,762
开快点 看他会不会跟上来
Speed up a little, see if he stays with you.

345
00:14:36,764 --> 00:14:38,297
开快点
Well, go faster.

346
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,665
你要跟丢了 他这么急干什么?
You're losing him. What is his hurry?

347
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:40,966
这么着 闪一下车灯
You know what, flash your lights.

348
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,234
让他知道是你
Let him know it's you.

349
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,570
他在闪车灯
He's flashing his lights.

350
00:14:44,572 --> 00:14:46,005
那是什么意思?
What's that mean?

351
00:14:46,007 --> 00:14:47,807
也许他想让我们停车
I... I think he wants us to pull over.

352
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:49,341
别停车!
Do not pull over!

353
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,743
我可不想一个人养这个孩子!
I'm not raising this baby alone!

354
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,879
坐稳了!
Hang on!

355
00:14:57,351 --> 00:15:00,352
你丈夫过世后
So, after your husband passed,

356
00:15:00,354 --> 00:15:02,021
你没再婚过?
you never remarried?

357
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:04,557
没有 只专注于工作和教堂的事务
No, just focused on work and the church.

358
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:05,825
你在哪儿工作?
Ah. And what do you do?

359
00:15:05,827 --> 00:15:08,027
在教堂里
I work at the church.

360
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:11,330
有你真帮了他们大忙
Well, they're lucky to have you.

361
00:15:11,332 --> 00:15:13,299
谢谢
Well, thank you.

362
00:15:13,301 --> 00:15:15,367
别在意
You're welcome.

363
00:15:15,369 --> 00:15:17,503
你了解这是什么情况吗?
Do you realize what's happening here?

364
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,071
我了解
Yeah, I do.

365
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:21,774
他们只吃面包 没法吃正餐了
They're filling up on bread and ruining their meal.

366
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:26,345
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey.  - Hey.

367
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:27,913
你们怎么这时候才来?
What took you guys so long?

368
00:15:27,915 --> 00:15:30,082
我们跟着Howard 可不知为什么
Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason,

369
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:32,751
他关了头灯 上了一条单行道
he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street.

370
00:15:34,322 --> 00:15:35,888
你们聊得怎么样?
So, what did we miss?

371
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,990
Mary和我互相了解了一下
Oh, just Mary and I getting to know each other a little.

372
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:40,292
Leonard 你父亲很有意思
Leonard, your father is just charming.

373
00:15:40,294 --> 00:15:41,327
他还破产了
He's also broke.

374
00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:42,761
他提过吗?
Did he mention that?

375
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:48,067
得了 老妈 你坐那边去...
Okay, Mom, you sit over there...

376
00:15:49,504 --> 00:15:51,871
我给Bernadette打电话 看看他们碰上什么了
And I'm gonna call Bernadette and see what's keeping them.

377
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,974
我不知道你破产了
If I'd known you were broke,

378
00:15:54,976 --> 00:15:57,243
我不该对面包的事情大惊小怪
I wouldn't have made a big deal about the bread.

379
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,749
喂 Penny
Hey, Penny.

380
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:06,252
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

381
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:10,589
刚才是你?
Oh, that was you?

382
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:13,592
说来话长
Long story.

383
00:16:13,594 --> 00:16:15,127
你们先吃吧
Why don't you go ahead and eat.

384
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:16,428
我们还要一会儿
We're gonna be a while.

385
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,935
我跟你讲 我没嗑药
I'm telling you, I'm not on drugs.

386
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,938
政府正要抓住我!
The government's out to get me!

387
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,544
最近最有意思的发现之一就是
Now, one of the more exciting things to be found recently

388
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,078
尼安德特人
is that Neanderthals

389
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,482
和智人曾经经常通婚
and Homo sapiens frequently mated with each other.

390
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,852
那正好解释了我和Sheldon父亲的婚姻
Well, that certainly explains my marriage to Sheldon's father.

391
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,592
笑点在于我父亲不是个聪明人
That's funny, because my father was not a very clever man.

392
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,261
你不解释我还真不知道呢
I'd be lost without you. 

393
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:54,667
我来祝一下酒
Uh, I would like to propose a toast

394
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:56,569
向我的妻子和准新娘
to my wife and bride-to-be.

395
00:16:56,571 --> 00:16:57,836
这里的笑点在于...
See, that's funny because...

396
00:16:57,838 --> 00:16:59,004
玩你的电话去
Back to your phone.

397
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:03,676
Penny啊...
Penny...

398
00:17:03,678 --> 00:17:05,744
我确信自己一直都爱你
I've always known I loved you,

399
00:17:05,746 --> 00:17:08,247
但过去的一年让我明白
but this last year has shown me

400
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:10,482
和你结婚让我更幸福
that I also love being married to you.

401
00:17:10,484 --> 00:17:12,985
谢谢你嫁给我
Thank you for saying yes.

402
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:16,121
谢谢你坚持不懈的求婚
Oh, thanks for asking until I did.

403
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,157
干杯
Hear, hear.

404
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,391
干杯
Cheers.

405
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:23,395
我也要祝酒
I, uh, I would also like to make a toast.

406
00:17:23,397 --> 00:17:24,363
噢
Aw.

407
00:17:24,365 --> 00:17:26,265
Leonard啊
Leonard,

408
00:17:26,267 --> 00:17:28,534
我很高兴你找到了一个
I am so happy that you have found a woman

409
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,469
爱你关心你的女人
who loves and cares for you.

410
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:32,638
你那是什么意思?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

411
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,408
你吃药了吗?
Why don't you take a pill?

412
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,110
就像你行房前来一片那样?
Like you did before sex?

413
00:17:38,112 --> 00:17:39,845
我真正需要的
What I really needed

414
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:41,647
其实是把眼睛蒙起来
was a blindfold.

415
00:17:41,649 --> 00:17:43,215
好了 大家...
All right, everyone...

416
00:17:43,217 --> 00:17:44,683
冷静些
calm down.

417
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:46,418
让我们都记住圣经里的话:
Let's all remember what it says in the Bible:

418
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,554
贤者慎怒
"He who is slow to anger

419
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:50,789
宽宏大量
is better than the mighty."

420
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:53,993
亲爱的 你能读本别的书吗?
Oh, dear woman, can you please read another book?

421
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:58,397
如果是上帝写的 我就读
When God writes one, I will.

422
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:07,840
如果有人想吃蛋酥
Um, if... if we want to order the soufflé,

423
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,042
我们该点了
we might want to get on that.

424
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,482
Leonard 如果不介意的话 我有点累了
Leonard, if you don't mind, I think I'm a little tired.

425
00:18:16,484 --> 00:18:17,683
今晚就到这儿吧
I'm gonna call it a night.

426
00:18:17,685 --> 00:18:19,184
好的 老爸
Sure, Dad.

427
00:18:19,186 --> 00:18:21,053
我累坏了
I'm a little tuckered out myself,

428
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,188
大家明天早上见吧
so I will see you all in the morning.

429
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:25,724
要一起坐车吗?
Would you like to share a cab?

430
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:26,925
好啊
That would be fine.

431
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:28,560
- 你住哪儿?  - 威斯汀饭店
- Where are you staying?  - I'm at the Westin.

432
00:18:28,562 --> 00:18:29,795
我也是
Oh, so am I.

433
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,130
要一起吃宵夜吗?
Can I interest you in a nightcap?

434
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,565
好主意
I think that you could.

435
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,572
发生什么了?
What is happening there?

436
00:18:40,574 --> 00:18:43,108
很明显啊
I think it's pretty obvious.

437
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,444
他们不想吃甜点 因为面包吃多了 
They don't want dessert 'cause they filled up on bread.

438
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,412
她没接电话
She's still not answering.

439
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:02,616
我爸也没回消息
My father's not texting me back.

440
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,621
他俩电话都关机了
'Cause they both turned their phones off.

441
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:15,796
我可不喜欢这样
I don't like this at all.

442
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:17,431
我也不喜欢
I don't like it either.

443
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:18,699
真的?
Really?

444
00:19:18,701 --> 00:19:20,768
我简直开心得不行啊
'Cause I love it.
