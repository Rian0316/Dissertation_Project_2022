00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,540
請前往第10法庭
please proceed to Court 10.

154
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,340
是你
You're him.

155
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,270
心水夏洛克

156
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,510
進錯廁所了你
Wrong toilet.

157
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,800
- 我是你的超級粉絲  - 顯而易見
- I'm a big fan.  - Evidently.

158
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,490
我讀了你那些案子  一直在追
I read your cases, follow them all.

159
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,160
在我襯衫上簽個名好嗎
Sign my shirt, would you?

160
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,820
我的粉絲分兩種
There are two types of fans.

161
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,630
有本事在下次謀殺前抓住我  這是第一種
Catch me before I kill again, Type A.

162
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,210
- 第二種呢  - 搭個出租就到我家了
- What's Type B?  - Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away.

163
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,430
你猜我是哪種
Guess which one I am?

164
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,700
壓痕

165
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
口袋

166
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,420
墨水

167
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,370
- 都不是  - 是嗎
- Neither.  - Really?

168
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,980
你根本不是粉絲
No, you're not a fan at all.

169
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,850
你前臂上的壓痕  是在桌子邊緣壓的
Those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk.

170
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,590
你應該很匆忙地打了字
You've been typing in a hurry, probably,

171
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,870
截稿時間到了  壓力巨大
pressure on, facing a deadline.

172
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,050
就這些
That all?

173
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,510
你的手腕上有墨跡
There's a smudge of ink on your wrist,

174
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,810
上衣口袋鼓起
a bulge in your left jacket pocket.

175
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,540
- 有點露餡了  - 那污點是故意弄的
- Bit of a giveaway?  - The smudge is deliberate,

176
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,790
你想看看我是不是像別人說的那麼厲害
to see if I'm as good as they say I am.

177
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,310
油墨  報紙印刷用的
Oil- based, used in newspaper print.

178
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,850
不過是用食指塗抹的  你的手指
But drawn on with an index finger, your finger.

179
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,530
作為記者  你不太可能在報社沾到油墨
Journalist. Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press.

180
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,460
你抹在那裏是試探我  
You put that there to test me.

181
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,110
我開始喜歡你了
I'm liking you.

182
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,220
我替你想好標題了
you may like a great feature,

183
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,650
夏洛克·福爾摩斯  帽檐下的真相
"Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat".

184
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,520
姬蒂
Kitty...

185
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,080
萊利  很高興見到你
Riley. Pleased to meet you.

186
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,440
不  我還是幫你免了這一問吧
Nah, I'm just saving you the job of asking.

187
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,530
不  我不接受採訪  
No, I won't give you an interview.

188
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,660
不  我也不需要錢
No, I don't want the money.

189
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,420
你和約翰·華生只是精神伴侶嗎
You and John Watson, just platonic?

190
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,430
我能否在這個問題上也記下個不字
Can I put you down for a "No" there as well

191
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,860
新聞界有你們各種各樣的緋聞
There's all sorts of gossip in the press about you.

192
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,840
遲早你會需要個和你同一戰線的人
Sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side.

193
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,040
一個幫你澄清流言的人
Someone to set the record straight.

194
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,480
你以為你能完成這種工作嗎
You think you're the girl for that job, do you?

195
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,760
我很聰明  你可以信任我
I'm smart and you can trust me...

196
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,490
完全信任
totally.

197
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:35,770
聰明  好吧  調查型記者
Smart? OK, investigative journalist.

198
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,620
很好  看著我說出你看到什麼
Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see.

199
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,960
如果你能力出眾  你根本不需要採訪
If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview,

200
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,580
你可以直接讀到你要的一切
you can just read what you need.

201
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,650
做不到嗎  還是我來吧
No? OK, my turn.

202
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,360
我看你在尋找職業生涯第一份獨家新聞
I look at you and I see someone who's still waiting for their first big scoop,

203
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
以得到編輯的關注
so their editor will notice them.

204
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
你穿了條昂貴的短裙
You're wearing an expensive skirt,

205
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,690
還改過兩次裙邊  
that's been rehemmed twice.

206
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,890
這是你僅有的高檔裙子
Only posh skirt you've got.

207
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,380
你的指甲  你沒錢經常保養
Your nails, you can't afford to do them that often.

208
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,910
我看到了一個慾望強烈的人
I see someone who's hungry,

209
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,720
我看到的不是聰明  當然更不是可靠
I don't see smart. I definitely don't see trustworthy.

210
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,360
我給你句引語吧  五個字
I'll give you a quote. If you like. Three little words.

211
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,280
你叫我噁心
You repel me.

212
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,830
- 犯罪顧問  - 是的
- "A consulting criminal."  - Yes.

213
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,380
你能詳細解釋一下證詞嗎
Your words. Can you expand on that answer?

214
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,680
金姆斯·莫裏亞蒂受人僱傭
James Moriarty is for hire.

215
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,730
- 他是個商人  - 是的
- A tradesman?  - Yes.

216
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,340
但不是幫你修暖氣那種服務
But not the sort who'd fix your heating?

217
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,820
不  是幫你裝炸彈或策劃暗殺那種
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination.

218
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,380
不過我猜讓他修鍋爐也能幹得不錯
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler.

219
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,750
你是否會將他描述為...
Would you describe him as...

220
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,650
- 引導  - 什麼
- Leading.  - What?

221
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,970
這樣不行  你這是引導證人
Can't do that.  You're leading the witness.

222
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,330
他會反對  而法官會支持  
He'll object and the judge'll uphold.

223
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,510
福爾摩斯先生
Mr Holmes.

224
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,440
問我怎麼看  問我如何描述他
Ask me how, how would I describe him?

225
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,050
我對他有怎樣的看法  他們沒教過你嗎
What opinion have I formed of him? They don't teach you this?

226
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,650
福爾摩斯先生  沒有你幫忙法庭照樣轉
Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.

227
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,890
你如何描述這個人  他的性格如何
How would you describe this man, his character?

228
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,350
錯誤一
First mistake.

229
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:11,140
金姆斯·莫裏亞蒂根本不是個人
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.

230
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,160
他是只蜘蛛
He's a spider.

231
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,890
網中心的蜘蛛
A spider at the centre of a web,

232
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,780
這張犯罪網中有上千條線
a criminal web with a thousand threads

233
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:18,900
而他對每一條的運作
and he knows precisely

234
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,890
都瞭如指掌
how each and every single one of them dances.

235
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:27,700
- 那你們認識...  - 不  別問這問題
- And how long...? - No, no. Don't, don't do that.

236
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,480
- 這問題爛透了  - 福爾摩斯先生
- That's really not a good question. - Mr Holmes!

237
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,740
我認識他多久了  問得真不怎麼樣
How long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry.

238
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,070
見過兩次  總共五分鐘
We met twice, five minutes in total.

239
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,010
我拿槍指著他  他想炸死我
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.

240
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,240
好像我倆挺來電
I felt we had a special something.

241
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,590
索雷爾律師  你真覺得這人是個專家麼
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert?

242
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,780
他和被告就見過五分鐘
After knowing the accused for just five minutes?

243
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,930
兩分鐘我就能看透一個人  五分鐘夠充裕了
Two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample.

244
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,620
- 福爾摩斯先生  那由陪審團決定  - 是嘛
- Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury. - Really?

245
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
商人

246
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
老師

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
有外遇

248
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
老師

249
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
已婚

250
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,250
圖書管理員

251
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,520
一個圖書管理員  兩個老師
One librarian, two teachers,

252
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,170
兩人工作壓力很大  應該是金融人士
two high- pressure jobs, probably the City.

253
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,830
陪審團主席是醫療秘書  外國受訓
The foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad,

254
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,470
- 因為她的速記  - 福爾摩斯先生
- judging by her shorthand. - Mr Holmes?

255
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,910
七個已婚  兩個在和對方搞外遇
Seven are married, two are having an affair with each other.

256
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,500
他們剛用完下午茶
They've just had tea and biscuits.

257
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,420
你想知道誰吃了威化餅麼
Would you like to know who ate the wafer?

258
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,960
福爾摩斯先生
Mr Holmes!

259
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,010
傳喚你來是為了回答索雷爾律師的問題
You've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions,

260
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,080
不是讓你來展示自己有多聰明
not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess.

261
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,520
請言簡意賅地回答問題
Keep your answers brief and to the point.

262
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,020
否則就算你蔑視法庭
Anything else will be treated as contempt.

263
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,330
少顯擺一會你能死麼
Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes with out showing off!

264
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,600
我說什麼來著  讓你別耍小聰明
What did I say? I said don't get clever.

265
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,840
我又不是水龍頭說關就關
I can't just turn it on and off like a tap.

266
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,670
- 如何  - 什麼如何
- Well? - Well, what?

267
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,970
你不是一直在麼
You were there for the whole thing,

268
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,840
從頭到尾都在旁聽
up in the gallery, start to finish.

269
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,520
跟你說的一樣
Like you said it would be...

270
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,000
他靠著椅背  一直很淡定
sat on his backside, never even stirred.

271
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,790
莫裏亞蒂根本不打算為自己辯護
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.

272
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,120
英格蘭銀行  倫敦塔  本頓維爾監獄
Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.

273
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,920
全國最安全的三個地方
Three of the most secure places in the country

274
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,980
六周以前  莫裏亞蒂成功闖入
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in,

275
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,080
沒人知道手法  或者原因
no- one knows how or why.

276
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,240
- 我們只知道...  - 他被拘留了
- All we know is... - He ended up in custody.

277
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,320
- 別這樣  - 哪樣
- Don't do that. - Do what?

278
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,640
- 那表情  - 啥  - 你又露出那表情了
- The look. - Look? - You're doing the look again.

279
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
我自己又看不見
Well, I can't see it, can I?

280
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
我的臉啊
It's my face.

281
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,640
對  而且你露出了一種
Yes and it's doing a thing, you are doing

282
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,270
"我們都知道到底怎麼回事"的表情
"We both know what's really going on here" face.

283
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,870
- 確實嘛  - 我就不知道  所以我才討厭你那表情
- We do. - No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying.

284
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,400
如果莫裏亞蒂想要王冠  他可以直接拿走
If Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them.

285
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,350
他想放走犯人  他們早就出獄了
If he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be out on the streets.

286
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,120
他之所以現在還在監獄裏
The only reason he's still in a prison cell right now

287
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,280
是因為他想要被關起來
is because he chose to be there.

288
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,180
這是他計劃的一部分
Somehow this is part of his scheme.

289
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,940
克雷西爾律師  請把第一位證人傳上法庭
Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness?

290
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,410
法官大人  我們沒有證人
Your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses.

291
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,500
我不懂
I don't follow.

292
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,780
你們不是辯方麼
You've entered a plea of not guilty.

293
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:15,080
可我的當事人並未提供任何證據
Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence.

294
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,820
被告陳述完畢
The defence... rests.

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,050
陪審團的各位
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

296
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,430
金姆斯·莫裏亞蒂被控告
James Moriarty stands accused...

297
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,430
和多起盜竊未遂案有關
of several counts of attempted burglary.

298
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,200
若他罪名成立
Crimes which, if he's found guilty,

299
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,720
將被監禁多年
will elicit a very long custodial sentence,

300
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,020
可是  他的法律團隊
and yet... his legal team...

301
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:47,030
卻不提供任何證據
has chosen to offer no evidence

302
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,590
來為他進行辯護
whatsoever to support their plea.

303
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,600
這不尋常  但出於公正
I find myself in the unusual position

304
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,260
我給陪審團一個裁決建議
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.

305
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,160
你們必須判他有罪
You must find him guilty.

306
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,340
有罪
Guilty.

307
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,960
你們必須判他有罪
You must find him guilty.

308
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,200
開庭了
They're coming back.

309
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,630
才六分鐘
That's six minutes.

310
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,420
說實話居然用了這麼久
Surprised it took them that long, to be honest.

311
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,060
廁所排隊的人真多
There's a queue for the loo!

312
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,860
請陪審團宣佈你們一致通過的裁決
Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree?

313
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:48,380
罪名不成立  他們居然判他無罪
Not guilty, they found him not guilty.

314
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,680
沒有辯護  莫裏亞蒂無罪釋放
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.

315
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,140
夏洛克
Sherlock?

316
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,780
你在聽嗎  他出來了
Are you listening? He's out,

317
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,970
你知道他會找上你  夏...
you know he'll be coming after you. Sherl...

318
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,850
一般人會先敲門
Most people knock.

319
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,770
不過我想你也不是一般人
But then, you're not most people, I suppose.

320
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,710
水正好開了
Kettle's just boiled.

321
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,080
巴赫都都會震驚的
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.

322
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,960
- 能坐嗎  - 請
- May I? - Please.

323
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,950
你知道嗎  巴赫臨死之前
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach,

324
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,530
聽見自己兒子在彈奏他的作品
he heard his son at the piano playing one of his... pieces.

325
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,380
還沒彈完男孩就不彈了
The boy stopped before he got to the end.

326
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,870
那個彌留之人就跳下床
The dying man jumped out of bed,

327
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,480
跑到鋼琴邊彈完了整首曲子
ran to the piano and finished it.

328
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,350
無法忍受未完成的樂章
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.

329
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,760
你也是  所以你才過來
Neither can you, that's why you've come.

330
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,310
實話說  你有那麼點開心
Be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased.

331
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,360
什麼  審判結果麼
What, with the verdict?

332
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,860
我又回來興風作浪了
With me, back on the streets.

333
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,250
每個童話故事都要有個老派的壞蛋
Every fairy tale needs a good old- fashioned villain.

334
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,070
你需要我  否則你屁都不是
You need me or you're nothing.

335
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,940
因為我們本來就很像
Because we're just alike, you and I,

336
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,540
只是你比我無聊
except you're boring.

337
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,650
你站在正義那一方
You're on the side of the angels.

338
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,860
當然  你控制了陪審團
You got to the jury, of course.

339
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,350
我都能闖入倫敦塔
I got into the Tower of London,

340
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,290
12間酒店房間又算什麼
you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms?

341
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:02,370
有線網
Cable network.

342
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,100
每個房間都有私人電視屏幕
Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen.

343
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,130
每個人都有自己的弱點
And every person has their pressure point.

344
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,130
如果你想讓你可愛的孩子們安然無恙
就照我說的做

345
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,520
都有自己想保護的人
Someone that they want to protect from harm.

346
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,300
小菜一碟
Easy peasy.

347
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,270
你打算怎麼做
So how are you going to do it?

348
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,640
毀了我
Burn me?

349
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,220
就是這謎題  最後的謎題
That's the problem, the final problem.

350
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,320
你想到是什麼了嗎
Have you worked out what it is yet?

351
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,020
最後一案到底是什麼
What's the final problem?

352
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,290
我告訴過你  不過你仔細聽了嗎
I did tell you... but did you listen?

353
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,150
對你來說  說句"我不知道"有多困難
How hard do you find it, having to say "I don't know"?

354
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,970
- 我不知道  - 很聰明啊  真聰明
- I don't know. - That's clever, very clever, awfully clever.

355
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,310
說起聰明  你跟你那些小朋友說了嗎
Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet?

356
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,090
說什麼
Told them what?

357
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,480
- 為何我闖入那些地方卻空手而回  - 沒有
- Why I broke into all those places and never took anything? - No.

358
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,310
- 但你明白  - 當然
- But you understand? - Obviously.

359
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,130
那請說吧
Off you go, then.

360
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,630
你自己也知道  我還說什麼
You want me to tell you what you already know?

361
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,560
不  我要你證明你知道
No, I want you to prove that you know it.

362
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,110
- 什麼都不拿是因為你不需要  - 好
- You didn't take anything because you don't need to. - Good.

363
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,940
你再也不用拿任何東西了
You'll never need to take anything ever again.

364
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,660
很好  因為什麼
Very good, because?

365
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,750
因為英格蘭銀行  倫敦塔和本頓維爾監獄
Because nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London

366
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,570
裏面沒有東西能比上你手裏那個
or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key

367
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,710
能讓你闖入其中的鑰匙
that could get you into all three.

368
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,950
任何地方的任何門我都打得開
I can open any door anywhere

369
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,700
只要幾行計算機代碼就行
with a few tiny lines of computer code.

370
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,800
什麼私人銀行賬戶都是胡扯  全屬於我
No such thing as a private bank account now, they're all mine.

371
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,510
已經沒有秘密了  我掌控著秘密
No such thing as secrecy, I own secrecy.

372
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,380
核武器編碼
Nuclear codes?

373
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,900
我隨隨便便就能炸了北約
I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.

374
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,250
滿世界都是封鎖的房間  有鑰匙便是國王
In a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king.

375
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,440
親愛的  你真該看看我戴王冠的樣子
And honey, you should see me in a crown.

376
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,470
你是利用審訊宣傳自己
You were advertising all through the trial,

377
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,620
給世人展現你的能耐
you were showing the world what you can do.

378
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,900
你也幫了我
And you were helping.

379
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,200
客戶可多了  自由政府  情報組織
Big client list... rogue governments, intelligence communities,

380
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,670
恐怖組織
terrorist cells.

381
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,950
他們都想要我
They all want me.

382
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,600
轉眼我就成了萬人迷
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.

383
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,650
如果你能進入任何銀行
If you can break any bank,

384
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,700
你還在乎什麼最高價競買人
what do you care about the highest bidder?

385
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,940
我不在乎  我就是愛看他們搶破頭的樣
I don't, I just like to watch them all competing.

386
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,810
"爸爸最愛的是我"  凡人真可愛
"Daddy loves me the best." Aren't ordinary people adorable?

387
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,570
反正你有約翰了
Well, you know, you've got John.

388
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,180
我也該找個同居男友才對
I should get myself a live- in one.

389
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,940
- 你為什麼要這麼做  - 肯定很有趣
- Why are you doing all of this? - It must be so funny.

390
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,480
你並不真的想要金錢或權力
You don't want money or power, not really.

391
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,900
到底為了什麼
What is it all for?

392
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,090
我想解決那個問題
I want to solve the problem.

393
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,350
我們的問題
Our problem.

394
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,430
最後的謎題
The final problem.

395
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,320
就要開始了  夏洛克  墜落
It's going to start very soon, Sherlock... the fall.

396
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,320
fall[墜落]同有瀑布之意  在這裏雙關

397
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,110
不過別怕  墜落跟飛翔一樣
But don't be scared, falling is just like flying,

398
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,600
不過下場只有死亡而已
except there's a more permanent destination.

399
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,710
我不喜歡謎語
Never liked riddles.

400
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,600
學著喜歡
Learn to.

401
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,380
因為我欠你一次墜落  夏洛克
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.

402
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,710
我  欠  你
I... owe... you.

403
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,190
莫裏亞蒂無罪釋放  中央法庭驚人的判決

404
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,230
驚天罪犯

405
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,660
如何

406
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,130
他如何脫罪

407
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,580
莫裏亞蒂消失了

408
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,640
萊辛巴赫英雄接下來又如何

409
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,550
兩個月後

410
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,350
您的卡出現問題

411
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,350
請稍等

412
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,900
感謝您的耐心

413
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,900
約翰

414
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,900
第歐根尼俱樂部

415
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,410
打擾下  我找麥考夫·福爾摩斯
Excuse me, I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes?

416
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,170
請問他在不在
Would you happen to know if he's around at all?

417
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,990
你聽不見我說話嗎
Can you not hear me?

418
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,570
好吧  有人知道嗎
Yes, all right. Anyone?

419
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,720
誰知道...
Anyone at all know...

420
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,850
麥考夫·福爾摩斯在哪  有人叫我在這等他
where Mycroft Holmes is, I've been asked to meet him here?

421
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,650
沒人理我  好吧
No takers, right.

422
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,460
我是透明的嗎  你們看得見我麼
Am I invisible, can you actually see me?

423
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,240
多謝兩位  有人叫我來找麥考夫·福爾摩斯
Thanks, gents. I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes.

424
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
搞什麼飛機
What the hell?!

425
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,840
傳統嘛  約翰  傳統界定了我們
Tradition, John, our traditions define us.

426
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,000
不准講話算哪門子傳統
So total silence is traditional, is it?

427
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,420
連句"把糖遞給我"都不能說嗎
You can't even say pass the sugar?

428
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,600
大半個外交部門
Three- quarters of the diplomatic service

429
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,860
和半個政府議會要員在一起喝茶
and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley,

430
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,760
這對大家都好  相信我
it's for the best, believe me.

431
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,740
我們可不想重演1972年的事
We don't want a repeat of... 1972.

432
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,740
血色星期天事件

433
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,120
- 不過在這可以說話  - 你看這個
- But we can talk in here. - You read this stuff?

434
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,150
挺有意思
Caught my eye.

435
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,300
週六他們要爆個猛料
Saturday, they're doing a big expose.

436
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,860
真好奇她從哪拿到的這些信息
I'd love to know where she got her information.

437
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,900
一個叫布魯克的人  認識麼
Someone called Brook. Recognise the name?

438
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,420
可能是校友吧
School friend, maybe?

439
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,070
夏洛克的校友
Of Sherlock's?

440
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:59,500
不過這不是我叫你來的原因
But that's not why I asked you here.

441
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,160
- 這誰  - 不認識嗎
- Who's that? - Don't know?

442
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,110
- 不認識  - 沒見過他
- No. - Never seen his face before?

443
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,560
他剛住到貝克街  就和你隔了兩戶人家
He's taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you.

444
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,320
我正想拜訪下鄰居呢
I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours.

445
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,100
我看還是算了
I'm not sure you'll want to.

446
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,340
蘇萊曼尼  阿爾巴尼亞職業殺手
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad, expertly trained killer,

447
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,910
就住在離你家不到20尺的地方
living less than 20 feet from your front door.

448
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,610
那地段很好  坐地鐵很方便
Well, it's a great location. Jubilee line's handy.

449
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:29,930
- 約翰  - 這跟我有什麼關係
- John... - What's it got to do with me?

450
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:32,480
德琴科·盧德米拉
Dyachenko Ludmila.

451
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,110
- 我好像見過她  - 俄國殺手
- Actually, I think I have seen her. - Russian killer.

452
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,920
住你家對面
She's taken the flat opposite.

453
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,770
好吧
Ok.

454
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,950
我有點明白你的意思了
I'm sensing a pattern here.

455
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,620
其實  四個國際頂級刺客都搬到了
In fact, four top international assassins relocate

456
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,660
221B附近
to within spitting distance of 221b.

457
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,520
有什麼想告訴我的麼
Anything you'd care to share with me?

458
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,710
我該搬家了嗎
I'm moving?

459
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,680
不難猜到他們的共同之處
It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it?

460
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,190
你覺得是莫裏亞蒂安排的嗎
You think this is Moriarty?

461
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,710
他跟夏洛克說他一定會回來
He promised Sherlock he'd come back.

462
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,520
如果這是莫裏亞蒂的傑作  我們早就死了
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already.

463
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,810
如果不是莫裏亞蒂  那又是誰
If not Moriarty, then who?

464
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,930
你既然這麼擔心他  怎麼不去找夏洛克談談
Why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him?

465
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,790
天吶  別說了
God, don't tell me.

466
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,360
我們之間有太多事  約翰
Too much history between us, John.

467
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,410
舊賬  憤恨
Old scores, resentments.

468
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:23,380
偷走了他的藍精靈  還是弄壞了他的機動戰士
Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man?

469
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,040
看完了
Finished.

470
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,060
我們都知道要發生什麼  約翰
We both know what's coming, John.

471
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,350
莫裏亞蒂不會罷休  他發誓要幹掉他唯一的敵手
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival.

472
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,080
所以你要我去照看你弟弟
So you want me to watch out for your brother

473
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,150
就因為他不會接受你的幫助
because he won't accept your help?

474
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
希望不會太麻煩你
If it's not too much trouble?

475
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,260
- 借過  - 抱歉
- Excuse me. - Sorry.

476
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,170
夏洛克  有件怪事...
Sherlock, something weird...

477
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,310
怎麼回事
What's going on?

478
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,340
- 綁架案  - 駐美大使路法斯·布盧爾
- Kidnapping. - Rufus Bruhl. The ambassador to the US.

479
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,440
他不是在華盛頓嗎
He's in Washington, isn't he?

480
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,630
不是他  是他的孩子
Not him, his children.

481
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,770
麥斯和克勞黛  一個七歲  一個九歲
Max and Claudette, age seven and nine.

482
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,440
- 他們在聖艾爾代茨  - 薩裏郡的豪華寄宿學校
- They're at St Aldates. - Posh boarding place in Surrey.

483
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,640
學校放假  其他寄宿生都回家了
School broke up, all the boarders went home.

484
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,490
只有幾個孩子留校  就包括他倆
Just a few kids remained, including those two.

485
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,670
兩個孩子不見了
The kids have vanished.

486
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,510
大使親自指名找你
The ambassador's asked for you personally.

487
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,670
萊辛巴赫英雄
The Reichenbach hero.

488
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,650
跟名人一起辦案真不錯啊
Isn't it great to be working with a celebrity?

489
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,470
應該很快就能放你走了  謝謝
We shouldn't need to keep you for much longer. Thank you.

490
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:20,120
- 沒事了  - 麥肯齊小姐是舍監  溫柔點
- It's all right. - Miss MacKenzie, House Mistress. Go easy.

491
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,790
麥肯齊小姐  你負責學生的安全
Miss MacKenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare,

492
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,540
可昨晚卻有人輕易闖入
yet you left this place wide open last night.

493
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,360
你是白癡  喝醉了  還是同夥
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?!

494
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
立刻  迅速  回答我
Now, quickly, tell me!

495
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,880
門窗都關好了
All the doors and the windows were properly bolted.

496
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,150
昨晚沒有任何人  包括我都沒進過他們的房間
No- one, not even me, went into their room last night.

497
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,580
你得相信我
You have to believe me!

498
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,260
我相信  我就是想讓你快點說
I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly.

499
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,420
麥肯齊小姐需要個口袋呼吸
Miss MacKenzie will need to breath into a bag now.

500
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,650
每學期六千塊
Six grand a term,

501
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,750
居然還不能保證孩子的安全
you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you.

502
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,690
你說其他的孩子都放假走了
You said the other kids had all left on their holidays.

503
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,810
只有他們倆還住在這層樓上
They were the only two sleeping on this floor.

504
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,820
完全沒有強行闖入的跡象
There's absolutely no sign of a break- in.

505
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,550
闖入者肯定是藏在什麼地方了
The intruder must have been hidden inside some place.

506
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,630
格林童話

507
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,880
帶我去哥哥的房間
Show me where the brother slept.

508
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,520
小男孩每晚都睡在這兒
The boy sleeps there every night.

509
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,300
盯著從走廊投進來的唯一光線
Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor.

510
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,910
他會認出每個人的形態和輪廓
He'd recognise every shape, every outline,

511
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,090
每一個走到門前的人的剪影
the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.

512
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,620
那又如何
OK, so?

513
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,740
那樣  如果有一個他沒見過的人走到門前
So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise,

514
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,100
就知道是闖入者  或許他都能看到武器的輪廓
an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.

515
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,780
他會怎麼做
What would he do?

516
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,760
在他們闖進來之前珍貴的幾秒鐘內
In the precious few seconds before they came into the room,

517
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,410
他如果沒有大聲呼救  會怎麼做
how would he use them if not to cry out?

518
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,950
這個小男孩  就是這個小男孩
This little boy, this particular little boy,

519
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,190
他讀了那麼多間諜小說  他會怎麼做
who reads all of those spy books, what would he do?

520
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,490
留下什麼標記嗎
He'd leave a sign?

521
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,290
叫安德森來
Get Anderson!

522
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,310
幫幫我們

523
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:23,810
亞麻油
Linseed oil.

524
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,470
沒什麼用  不能幫我們找到綁匪
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper.

525
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,080
很不錯  安德森
Brilliant, Anderson.

526
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,250
- 是嗎  - 是啊  很不錯地展現了白癡的風範
- Really? - Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.

527
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,970
看地板
Floor.

528
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,720
他為我們留下了足跡
He... made a trail for us.

529
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,190
男孩被逼著走在他們前面
The boy was made to walk ahead of them.

530
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,430
怎麼  因為踮腳了嗎  
On what, tiptoe?

531
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,560
不安的表現
Indicates anxiety.

532
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,410
有人拿槍指著他的腦袋
Gun held to his head.

533
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,610
女孩被人拉著側身走在他旁邊
The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways.

534
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,190
他的胳膊架在她的脖子上
He had his left arm cradled about her neck.

535
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,820
就到這了  我們不知道他們接下來去哪了
That's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here.

536
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,360
到底還是沒什麼用
Tells us nothing after all.

537
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,520
說得對  安德森  是沒什麼用
You're right, Anderson, nothing.

538
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,820
只讓我們知道他的鞋碼  身高  步法和步速
Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.

539
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,870
玩得開心嗎
Having fun?

540
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,750
現在開心了
Starting to.

541
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,390
或許還是別笑的好  畢竟有小孩被綁了
Maybe don't do the smiling. Kidnapped children?

542
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,810
如果門都鎖上了  他怎麼躲過的監視器
How could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked.

543
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,840
他門沒鎖的時候就進來了
He walked in when they weren't locked.

544
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,120
但那種學校哪會讓陌生人隨意進出
But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.

545
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,130
只要時機對  任何人都能隨意進出任何地方
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.

546
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,780
昨天是期末
Yesterday, end of term,

547
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,280
到處是家長  司機  員工
parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.

548
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,410
他們中間再混進個陌生人誰會察覺
What's one more stranger among that lot?

549
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,920
他伺機行事
He was waiting for them.

550
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,300
只要找個好地方藏身即可
All he had to do was find a place to hide.

551
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,790
聖巴塞洛繆醫院

552
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,740
茉莉
Molly!

553
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,760
你好啊  我正要出去
Hello, I'm just going out.

554
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,220
- 不  你不出去  - 我午飯約了人
- No, you're not. - I've got a lunch date.

555
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:08,320
- 取消吧  我們一起吃午餐  - 啥
- Cancel it, you're having lunch with me. - What?

556
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,300
我需要你的幫助
I need your help.

557
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,210
事關你的一個前男友  我們正在追查他的下落
It's one of your old boyfriends, we're trying to track him down.

558
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,400
他近來有些搗蛋
He's been a bit naughty.

559
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,430
- 是莫裏亞蒂干的嗎  - 當然是他
- It's Moriarty? - Of course it's Moriarty!

560
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,950
其實金算不上是我男朋友
Jim actually wasn't even my boyfriend,

561
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,860
我們只約會過三次  我沒再和他交往了
we went out three times. I ended it.

562
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,050
是啊  然後他去偷走了王冠和權杖
Yes, then he stole the Crown Jewels,

563
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,980
闖進英國央行
broke into the Bank of England

564
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,520
還組織了本頓維爾監獄的越獄
and organised a prison break in Pentonville.

565
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,920
為了維護法紀和秩序  我建議你
For the sake of law and order, I suggest you

566
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,350
將來就不要找男朋友了  茉莉
avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.

567
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,710
那些油漬  約翰  綁匪腳印裏的油漬
Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.

568
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,340
會幫我們找到莫裏亞蒂
It'll lead us to Moriarty.

569
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,150
他鞋上所有的化學品都保存了下來
All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved.

570
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,380
鞋底就好像護照
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.

571
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,800
如果我們走運  能查到他最近的全部行蹤
If we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to.

572
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,430
那個需要做分析
I need that analysis.

573
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,370
是堿性的
Alkaline.

574
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:56,050
- 謝謝你  約翰  - 是茉莉
- Thank you, John. - Molly.

575
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,100
是啊
Yes.

576
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,450
白堊

577
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,950
瀝青

578
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,400
磚塵

579
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,550
植物

580
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,360
我欠你的
I... o... u.

581
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,070
甘油分子
Glycerol molecule.

582
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,800
甘油
甘油  丙烷  1,2,3  三醇  3羥基官能團

583
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,290
是什麼東西
What are you?

584
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,300
你說"我欠你的"是什麼意思
What did you mean, IOU?

585
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,740
你剛剛說"我欠你的"
You said IOU.

586
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:41,970
你剛剛一直在念叨這幾個字
You were muttering it while you were working.

587
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,420
沒什麼  記下來的東西罷了
Nothing, mental note.

588
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,450
你有點像我爸  他死了  哦不  抱歉
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead. No, sorry.

589
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,200
茉莉  請不要覺得非得跟我搭訕
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation,

590
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,950
這真不是你的強項
it's really not your area.

591
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:56,850
他死前那段日子  總是很開心  心情愉悅
When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely,

592
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,780
可他以為沒人看到他時就不是這樣了
except when he thought no- one could see.

593
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,340
- 我有次看到他的樣子  很哀傷  - 茉莉
- I saw him once, he looked sad. - Molly.

594
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,630
你就很哀傷  當你以為他看不到你的時候
You look sad, when you think he can't see you.

595
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,640
你沒事吧  別說你沒事
Are you OK? And don't just say you are,

596
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,040
因為我知道那種表情的含義
because I know what that means,

597
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,530
以為沒人看著你時就流露哀傷的含義
looking sad when you think no- one can see you.

598
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,420
- 你就能看見我  - 我對你不算數
- You can see me. - I don't count.

599
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,150
我只是想說  如果我能做什麼
What I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do,

600
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:31,400
你需要我做任何事  我都會幫你
anything you need, anything at all, you can have me.

601
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,080
不是  我就是說  我是說
No, I just mean, I mean,

602
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,190
如果你需要我做什麼事  我都可以
if there's anything you need, it's fine.

603
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,290
但我會需要你做什麼
But what can I need from you?

604
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,030
沒什麼  我不知道
Nothing. I don't know.

605
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,270
其實你大可只說句謝謝
You could probably say thank you, actually.

606
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,690
那謝謝了
Thank you?

607
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,560
我要去買點薯片吃
I'm just going to go and get some crisps.

608
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,960
你想吃什麼嗎
Do you want anything?

609
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,650
算了  我知道你不吃
It's OK, I know you don't.

610
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,560
- 其實  要不我...  - 我知道你不吃
- Well, actually, maybe I'll... - I know you don't.

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,880
- 還有一個  - 什麼
- there's another one. - What?

614
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,000
今天有人放在我們門階上  沒錯  你瞧啊
On our doorstep. Found it today. Yes, and look at that.

615
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,380
你瞧  是完全相同的封印
Look at that, exactly the same seal.

616
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,340
- 麵包屑  - 我回來的時候就放在那兒
- Breadcrumbs. - It was there when I got back.

A little trace of breadcrumbs.

625
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,120
喜歡自吹自擂的綁匪
The sort that likes to boast,

626
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,540
他把這一切看作是個遊戲
the sort that thinks it's all a game.

627
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,990
他坐在我們的公寓裏  對我說的原話是
He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me...

628
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,140
每個童話故事都要有個老派的壞蛋

629
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,770
第五樣物質  是童話的一部分

633
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,720
是聚甘油蓖麻醇酯
PGPR!

634
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,930
- 那是什麼  - 是用來做巧克力的
- What's that? - It's used in making chocolate.

635
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,040
這是一小時前傳真過來的
This fax arrived an hour ago.

636
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:30,760
快點啊
他們要死了

637
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,560

我們要找出城裏的一個地方

00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,870
我認為我們要找的是一間廢棄的糖果廠
I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory.

643
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,010
我們得縮小範圍  有瀝青的糖果廠呢
We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt?

644
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,300
不行  還是太泛泛  得有更具體的東西
No, no, no, no, too general. Something more specific.

645
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,300
白堊  白堊質粘土  這樣能縮小地理範圍
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far thinner band of geology.

658
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,030
好吧  行動  行動
Right, come on. Come on!

659
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,890
好了  你們去那邊看
OK, you look over there.

660
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,390
不要有疏漏
Look everywhere.

661
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,350
大家請散開  散開
OK, spread out, please, spread out.

662
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,370
剛剛熄滅的  他們還在這兒
This was alight moments ago. They're still here!

663
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,080

- 水銀  - 什麼

666
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,460
糖紙  上面塗了水銀  是有毒的
The papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal.

667
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,570
他們吃得越多
The more they ate...

668
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,380
就會要了他們的命
It was killing them.

669
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,240
但是單個不足以致命
But it's not enough to kill them on its own.

670
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,760
如果攝入足夠多的量  最終會導致他們死亡
Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.

671
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,340
他不需要親自來行刑
He didn't need to be there for the execution.

672

遙控殺人  他可以待在千里之外

他們越餓  吃得越多
The hungrier they got, the more they ate,

674
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,560
就死得越快  真漂亮

675
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,890
- 控制一下  - 在這邊
- Sherlock. - Over here!

00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:54,200
我會照顧他  別擔心
I've got him, don't worry.

677
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,400
好了  專業人士都問完了
Right then, the professionals are finished.

678
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,060
要是外行還想進去自己問問
If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn.

679
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,650
記住  她受了驚嚇  而且只有七歲
Now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old,

680
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,900
所以  如果你能...
so, anything you can do to...

681
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,000
- 別太夏洛克嗎  - 對  可能會比較好

683
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,760
別這樣  我知道你很害怕
No, no, I know it's been hard for you.

684
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,090
- 克勞黛  聽著  - 出去  出去
- Claudette, listen to me. - Out. Get out!

685
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,480
- 這沒道理啊  - 孩子受驚過度
- Makes no sense. - Kid's traumatised.

686
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,140
夏洛克某些地方讓她想起那個綁匪
Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper.

687
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,320
她說什麼了嗎
What's she said?

688
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,190
一個字都沒說
Hasn't uttered another syllable.

689
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,040
- 那個男孩呢  - 還是昏迷不醒
- And the boy? - No, he's unconscious.

690
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,630
仍在重癥監護中
He's still in intensive care.

691
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,430
別往心裏去
Well, don't let it get to you,

692
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,930
每次看你進門  我都想尖叫
I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room.

693
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,870
說實話很多人都有同感
In fact, so do most people.

694
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:08,580
走吧
Come on.

695
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,810
只憑腳印你就找到了那些孩子  了不起
Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint,

696
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,140
真是太神奇了
it's really amazing.

697

703
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,730
"我們要找的是一家廢棄的糖果廠"
'We're looking for a disused sweet factory.'

704
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,030

705
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,650

準備好聽故事了嗎
Are you ready for the story?

714
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,080
這是自誇騎士的故事
This is the story of Sir Boast- a- lot.

715
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,930
一個腳印  這就是他所有的線索
A footprint, it's all he had.

716
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,250
一個腳印
A footprint.

717
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,840
是啊  你也知道他的能耐
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.

貝克街犯罪現場調查專家
CSI Baker Street.

719
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,250
可我們的人就做不到
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.

720
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,390
所以我們需要他  他更厲害
Well, that's why we need him, he's better.

721
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,070
這只是一種解釋
That's one explanation.

722
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,530
還有別的解釋嗎
And what's the other?

723
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,200
自誇騎士是圓桌騎士中
Sir Boast- a- lot was the bravest

724
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,860
最勇敢  也是最聰明的騎士
and cleverest knight at the round table.

725
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,280
但其他騎士逐漸開始厭倦他那些
But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories

726
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,860
講述他多麼英勇
about how brave he was

727
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,060
頌揚他屠龍偉業的故事
and how many dragons he'd slain.

728
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,890
很快他們就開始懷疑
And soon they began to wonder,

729
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,630
自誇爵士的故事究竟是不是真的
"Are Sir Boast- a- lot's stories even true?"

730
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,160
只有他能找到那些證據
Only he could have found that evidence.

The girl screams her head off when she sees him...

733
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,270
她可從來沒見過他
A man she has never seen before,

734
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,720
除非她以前見過他
unless she had seen him before.

735
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:23,560
你究竟想說什麼
What's your point?

736
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:26,040
你知道我想說什麼  你只是不想相信
You know what it is, you just don't want to think about it.

737
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,530
於是所有的騎士都去對亞瑟王說
So, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said,

738
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:34,840
"我不相信自誇騎士的故事"
'I don't believe Sir Boast- a- lot's stories.'

739
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,030
"他就是個大騙子"
'He's just a big old liar'

740
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,610
"都是他編的故事  讓自己顯得很了不起"
'who makes things up to make himself look good.

741
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,060
你們不會真以為是他幹的吧
You're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you?

742
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,600
我認為我們得考慮這種可能性
I think we have to entertain the possibility.

743
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,700
後來  甚至連國王也開始懷疑
And then, even the King began to wonder.

744
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,800
但自誇騎士的最終問題還不是這個
But that wasn't the end of Sir Boast- a- lot's problem.

745
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:03,130
不
No.

746
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,900
這還不是他的最終問題
That wasn't the final problem.

747
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:10,930
故事講完了
The end.

748
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,410
停車
Stop the cab.

749
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,040
停車
Stop the cab!

750
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,330
那是怎麼回事
What was that?!

751
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,900
那是什麼
What was that?

752
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,060
不要錢了
No charge.

753
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,370
小心
Watch out!

754
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,410
謝謝
Thank you.

755
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,230
夏洛克
Sherlock!

756
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,960
是他  是那個人
That is him. It's him.

757
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,450
叫蘇萊曼尼什麼的
Sulejmani or something,

758
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:03,990
麥考夫給我看過他的檔案
Mycroft showed me his file.

759
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:05,450
他是阿爾巴尼亞的黑幫大佬
He's a big Albanian gangster,

760
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,600
住的地方跟我們只隔兩戶
lives two doors down from us.

761
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,410
- 他因為跟我握手而被殺  - 什麼意思
- He died because I shook his hand. - What do you mean?

762
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,750
他救了我的命  卻不能碰我  為什麼
He saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. Why?

763
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,920
我們家門口就住著四個殺手
Four assassins living right on our doorstep.

764
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,380
他們不是來殺我的
They haven't come here to kill me.

765
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,510
他們必須保住我的命
They have to keep me alive.

766
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,570
我手上有他們都想要的東西
I've got something that all of them want.

767
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,710
但如果他們中任何一個接近我
But if one of them approaches me,

768
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:26,240
其他人就會殺死他
The others kill them before they can get it.

769
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,650
選擇您要使用的網絡

770
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,650
從以下列表中選擇您要使用的網絡 必要時請輸入網絡密碼

771
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,590
所有注意力都在我身上
All of the attention is focused on me.

772
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,370
一張嚴密的監控網正監視著我們
There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now.

773
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:38,400
你手上究竟有什麼東西這麼重要
So what have you got that's so important?

774
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,220
我得問問除塵的狀況
I need to ask about the dusting.

775
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:45,570
要精確的細節  上個星期哪裏被清掃過
Precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned?

776
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,170
星期二  我清理了你的地毯
Tuesday, I did your lino.

777
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,960
不  是這裏  我們要在這個房間找
No, in here, this room, this is where we'll find it.

778
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,300
任何灰塵被擦拭的痕跡
Any break in the dust line.

779
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,220
什麼都能歸位  但灰塵不行
You can put back anything but dust.

780
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,400
灰塵即鐵證
Dust is eloquent.

781
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,930
他這是要做什麼
What is it all about?

782
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,160
找攝像頭  我們被監視了
Cameras, we're being watched.

783
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,080
什麼  攝像頭  在這兒嗎
What?! Cameras? Here?

784
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,560
我穿著睡衣呢
I'm in my nightie!

785
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,370
- 不  探長  - 怎麼了
- No, Inspector. - Why?

786
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:25,630
- 我的回答是不  - 我什麼都沒問呢
- The answer's no. - You've not heard the question!

787
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,990
你想把我帶到警署去
You want to take me to the station.

788
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,490
就不麻煩你開口問了
Just saving you the trouble of asking.

789
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:30,210
夏洛克
Sherlock.

790
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,260
- 因為那聲尖叫  - 是的
- The scream? - Yeah.

791
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,240
是誰說的  多諾萬  肯定是多諾萬
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.

792
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,980
我是否與綁架案有牽連
"Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?"

793
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,820
莫裏亞蒂很聰明
Moriarty is smart.

794
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,060
他在她腦海裏植入懷疑的種子
He planted that doubt in her head.

795
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:42,510
那種感覺縈繞不去
That little nagging sensation.

796
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,420
很難抗拒
You're going to have to be strong to resist.

797
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,910
你沒法扼殺一種想法  對吧
You can't kill an idea, can you?

798
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,610
只要它在這裏  生根發芽
Not once it's made a home... there.

799
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,140
你會跟我走嗎
Will you come?

800
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:56,170
他的下一步棋  是一張照片
One photograph, that's his next move.

801
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,190
莫裏亞蒂的遊戲
Moriarty's game.

802
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:58,100
先是孩子的尖叫
First the scream,

803
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,190
然後是我被帶去問訊的照片
then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning.

804
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,300
他想一點一點地毀了我
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.

805
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,710
這是一場遊戲  雷斯垂德
It is a game, Lestrade,

806
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,250
而我並不想參與
and not one I'm willing to play.

807
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,090
代我向多諾萬警佐問好
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.

808
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,240
- 他們會作出決定  - 什麼決定
- They'll be deciding. - Deciding?

809
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,960
是否帶著逮捕令回來逮捕我
Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me.

810
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:48,890
你這麼覺得嗎
You think?

811
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,000
這是標準程序
Standard procedure.

812
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,480
你應該跟他走  別人會以為...
You should have gone with him. People'll think...

813
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,400
我才不在乎別人怎麼想
I don't care what people think.

814
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,080
但你不想讓他們認為你很蠢  或犯了錯
You'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong.

815
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,680
不  是他們蠢  他們犯了錯
No, that would just make them stupid or wrong.

816
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,950
夏洛克  我不想讓這個世界以為你是...
Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're...

817
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,020
以為我是什麼
That I am what?

818
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,290
騙子
A fraud.

819
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,120
- 你擔心他們是對的  - 什麼
- You're worried they're right. - What?

820
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,510
- 你擔心他們對我的判斷是對的  - 不
- That they're right about me. - No.

821
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,460
這就是你煩躁的原因
That's why you're upset.

822
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,610
你不能不考慮  他們或許是對的
You can't entertain the possibility they may be right.

823
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,210
- 你害怕自己也受了騙  - 我沒有
- You're afraid you've been taken in as well. - No, no.

824
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,050
莫裏亞蒂也在玩弄你的思想
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too.

825
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,970
你難道看不出是怎麼回事嗎
Can't you SEE what's going on?!

826
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:31,150
不  我認識的是真實的你
No, I know you for real.

827
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:32,010
百分之百嗎
100 percent?

828
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,250
誰會一直假裝成這麼個討厭鬼
Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.

829
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,510
- 夏洛克·福爾摩斯  - 是的  長官
- Sherlock Holmes? - Yes, sir.

830
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,630
媒體上經常報道的那個傢伙
That bloke that's been in the press?

831
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,990
我以為他是個私家偵探
I thought he was some sort of private eye.

832
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,790
- 他是的  - 我們一直都在向他咨詢
- He is. - We've been consulting with him,

833
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,510
你是這個意思嗎
that's what you're telling me?

834
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:57,350
我們沒有讓他插手過機要案件吧
Not used him on any proper cases though, have we?

835
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:58,650
有那麼一兩個吧
Well, one or two.

836
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,520
或許是二三十個
Or 20 or 30.

837
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:01,230
什麼
What?!

838
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:03,880
不是只有我這麼做  格雷格森...
I'm not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson...

839
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,410
閉嘴
Shut up!

840
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,660
一個業餘偵探
An amateur detective

841
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,280
居然能接觸到各種機密信息
given access to all sorts of classified information.

842
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,330
現在他還是一個案件的疑犯
And now he's a suspect in a case.

843
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,400
- 恕我直言  - 你這個白癡  雷斯垂德
- With all due respect... - You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade!

844
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,700
現在就去把他抓來  就現在
Now go and fetch him in, right now.

845
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,420
去抓他
Do it!

846
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,560
現在你們得意了
Proud of yourselves?

847
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,390
要是不止這一個案子呢
Well, what if it's not just this case?

848
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,800
要是每次他都是在耍我們呢
What if he's done this to us every single time?

849
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,050
警局裏還是有人護著我們的  是雷斯垂德
So, still got some friends on the force. It's Lestrade.

850
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:48,030
他說他們正趕過來
Says they're all coming over here now.

851
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,110
所有被你弄得沒面子的警官
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.

852
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:52,230
都排著隊要來拷你呢
Every officer you've ever made feel like a tit,

853
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,590
那可是不少人呢
which is a lot of people.

854
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,910
抱歉  是不是打擾你們了
Sorry, am I interrupting?

855
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:00,570
有人送來一個包裹  我給忘了
Some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot,

856
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:01,720
上面標記說易腐爛
marked perishable.

857
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,280
我只好簽收了
I had to sign for it.

858
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,030
名字挺滑稽  是德語  像是童話裏的
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.

859
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,120
燒焦了
Burnt to a crisp.

860
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,120
這是什麼意思
What does it mean?

861
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,890
- 警察  - 我去開門
- Police! - I'll go.

862
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,600
夏洛克
Sherlock.

863
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,650
- 抱歉  赫德森太太  - 我們得談談
- Excuse me, Mrs Hudson. - We need to talk to you.

864
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,000
別就這麼闖進來呀
Don't barge in like that!

865
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,560
你們有逮捕令嗎  有嗎
Have you got a warrant? Have you?

866
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,820
別插手  約翰
Leave it, John.

867
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,240
講點禮貌
Manners!

868
00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:39,520
夏洛克·福爾摩斯  我現在
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you

869
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,290
以涉嫌誘拐和綁架的罪名逮捕你
on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.

870
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,090
- 沒關係  約翰  - 他沒有反抗
- It's OK, John. He's not resisting...

871
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:45,000
不  這怎麼會沒關係  這太荒謬了
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.

872
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,800
現在帶他下樓
Get him downstairs now.

873
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,690
你真不該這麼做
You really don't have to do this.

874
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,160
別妨礙公務  不然我連你一起逮捕
Don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too.

875
00:53:55,350 --> 00:53:56,270
你滿意了嗎
You done?

876
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,500
我早就說過
I said it.

877
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,370
- 我們初次見面的時候  - 算了吧
- First time we met. - Don't bother.

878
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,020
他不會滿足於破案
Solving crimes won't be enough.

879
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,660
總有一天  他會越過底線
One day he'll cross the line.

880
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:07,470
你自己想想  什麼人會去綁架孩子
Now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids

881
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,870
就為了通過找回他們來顯擺自己
just so he can impress us all by finding them?

882
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:11,300
- 多諾萬  - 長官
- Donovan? - Sir?

883
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:14,260
- 人抓住了嗎  - 是的  長官
- Got our man? - Yes, sir.

884
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,890
要我說的話  看著他就覺得古怪
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.

885
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,130
這種義警通常都這樣
Often are, these vigilante types.

886
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:23,590
你看什麼呢
What are you looking at?

887
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,180
你還好嗎  長官
Are you all right, sir?

888
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,390
- 來跟我作伴了  - 是的
- Joining me? - Yeah.

889
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,940
顯然打總警司一拳
Well, apparently it's against the law

890
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,980
屬於違法行為
to chin the Chief Superintendent.

891
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:37,740
這可不太聰明
Bit awkward this.

892
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,750
這下沒人來保釋我們了
There's no- one to bail us.

893
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,790
我更傾向於現在就大膽逃跑
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.

894
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,710
- 所有單位到27區  - 什麼
- All units to 27. - What?

895
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:47,410
所有單位到2
All units to 2...

896
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,500
女士們  先生們  請你們趴下好嗎
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees?

897
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,200
- 最好現在就趴下  - 照他說的做
- NOW would be good! - Do as he says!

898
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,110
提醒你們一聲  槍是他奪的
Just so you're aware, the gun is his idea,

899
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,850
我就是個  你知道
I'm just a... you know.

900
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:05,680
我的人質
My hostage.

901
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,640
人質  沒錯  這個可以有
Hostage, yes, that works.

902
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,060
這個可以有
That works.

903
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,170
現在怎麼辦
So what now?

904
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,520
如莫裏亞蒂所願  做個逃犯  跑
Doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive. Run!

905
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,810
追上他  雷斯垂德
Get after him, Lestrade!

906
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,510
抓緊我的手
Take my hand.

907
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,540
這下肯定要被人閒話了
Now people will definitely talk.

908
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,220
- 槍掉了  - 別管了
- The gun! - Leave it!

909
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,400
夏洛克  等等
Sherlock, wait!

910
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,730
我們得協調一致才行
We're going to need to coordinate.

911
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,160
往右邊去  往你右邊去
Go to your right. Go to your right.

912
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:50,650
每個人都寧可信其有
Everybody wants to believe it,

913
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:51,720
這就是其高明之處
that's what makes it so clever.

914
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,050
一個比真相更受人青睞的謊言
A lie that's preferable to the truth.

915
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:55,950
我的演繹法是騙人的
My deductions were a sham.

916
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,550
大家都舒坦了  夏洛克毫無過人之處
No- one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man.

917
00:55:58,550 --> 00:55:59,910
麥考夫  他能幫我們
Mycroft, he could help us.

918
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,170
現在真不是打親情牌的好時機
Big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment.

919
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:07,960
夏洛克
Sherlock...

920
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:08,970
有人跟來了
we're being followed.

921
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,300
我就知道躲不過警察
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.

922
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,160
那人不是警察
That's not the police,

923
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,950
是咱們貝克街上的新鄰居
it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street.

924
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,190
看他能不能給我們答案
Let's see if he can give us some answers.

925
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,590
我們去哪兒
Where are we going?

926
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,290
我們要衝到那輛巴士前面
We're going to jump in front of that bus.

927
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:38,620
你想從我這裏得到什麼
Tell me what you want from me.

928
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:40,720
告訴我
Tell me!

929
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,760
他放在你公寓裏了
He left it at your flat.

930
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:45,420
- 誰  - 莫裏亞蒂
- Who? - Moriarty.

931
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,740
放了什麼
What?

932
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,220
- 程序代碼  - 這就對了
- The computer key code. - Of course.

933
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,390
他公開售賣
He's selling it.

934
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,410
闖進倫敦塔的程序
The programme he used to break into the Tower.

935
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,530
他是在來的時候動的手腳
He planted it when he came around.

936
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,070
它可以扭轉局面
It's a game- changer.

937
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,070
它是把鑰匙  能攻破任何系統
It's a key, it can break into any system

938
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:19,340
此時此刻就在我們公寓
and it's sitting in our flat right now.

939
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,830
所以他留下那個信息
That's why he left that message,

940
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:23,190
告訴大家該去哪裏  "去找夏洛克"
telling everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!"

941
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,300
我們必須回公寓找到它
We need to get back into the flat and search.

942
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,150
刑事調查局在那守著
CID will be camped out.

943
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,580
為什麼栽贓給你
Why plant it on you?

944
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,370
又一個搞壞我名聲的歪點子
It's another subtle way of smearing my name,

945
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,200
現在我成了那些罪行的最大嫌疑人
now I'm best pals with all those criminals.

946
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,780
你看過這個嗎
Yeah, well, have you seen this?

947
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,540
大爆料
A kiss- and- tell.

948
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,950
夏洛克  駭人聽聞的真相
密友理查·布魯克徹底坦白

949
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:41,180
一個叫理查·布魯克的傢伙
Some bloke called Rich Brook.

950
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,160
這人是誰
Who is he?

951
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:12,450
現在發表聲明是不是太晚了
Too late to go on the record?

952
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,750
恭喜了  "夏洛克·福爾摩斯的真相"
Congratulations, "The Truth About Sherlock Holmes."

953
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:20,070
誰都想要的獨家  而你搞到了  漂亮
The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo!

954
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:21,530
我給過你機會
I gave you your opportunity.

955
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:24,000
我本想站在你這邊  記得嗎
I wanted to be on your side, remember?

956
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,360
你拒絕了我  所以...
You turned me down, so...

957
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,070
然後就有大驚喜  有人爆出猛料
Then lo and behold, someone spills all the beans.

958
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,000
真是心想事成  布魯克是誰
How utterly convenient. Who is Brook?

959
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,730
說吧  姬蒂  鬼才相信電話爆料
Come on, Kitty, no- one trusts the voice at the end of a phone.

960
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,510
毫無疑問  咖啡館裏碰面
All those little meetings in cafes,

961
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:38,670
酒店房間裏會談
those sessions in the hotel room

962
00:58:38,670 --> 00:58:40,240
他對著採訪機侃侃而談
when he gabbled into your Dictaphone.

963
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:42,560
你怎麼就相信他了呢
How do you know that you can trust him?

964
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,460
一個揣著聖盃冒出來的傢伙
A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.

965
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:47,420
他怎麼讓你信服的呢
What were his credentials?

966
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:51,390
親愛的  買不到咖啡粉煮的
Darling, they didn't have any ground coffee,

967
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,630
我就買了普通的
so I just got normal.

968
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,750
你說過他們不可能找到這裏來
You said that they wouldn't find me here,

969
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,120
你說過我在這裏很安全
you said that I'd be safe here.

970
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:06,000
你很安全
You are safe.

971
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,010
理查  我是證人
Richard, I'm a witness,

972
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:08,500
他們不會當著證人的面傷害你
they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses.

973
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,170
這就是你的爆料人
So that's your source?

974
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,400
莫裏亞蒂就是理查·布魯克
Moriarty is Richard Brook?

975
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,160
他就是理查·布魯克  不存在莫裏亞蒂
Of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty.

976
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,830
從來就沒有這個人
There never has been.

977
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,630
- 你說什麼胡話  - 仔細看看他
- What are you talking about? - Look him up.

978
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:23,860
理查·布魯克  夏洛克雇來扮演莫裏亞蒂的人
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty.

979
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,000
華生醫生  我知道你是好人
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man,

980
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,930
不要  不要傷害我
don't, don't, don't hurt me.

981
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,420
不對  你是莫裏亞蒂  他就是莫裏亞蒂
No, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty!

982
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,870
我們見過  記得嗎  你想把我炸死
We've met, remember? You were going to blow me up!

983
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,940
對不起  對不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

984
00:59:43,230 --> 00:59:45,990
他出錢雇我  而我需要活兒
He paid me, I needed the work.

985
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:47,350
我是個演員  我失業了
I'm an actor, I was out of work.

986
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,060
夏洛克  你最好解釋一下
Sherlock, you'd better explain,

987
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,170
我完全搞不懂了
because I am not getting this.

988
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,150
我來解釋吧  白紙黑字
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.

989
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,980
全在這裏  板上釘釘的證據
It's all here, conclusive proof.

990
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,900
夏洛克是個騙子
他策劃了所有的罪案

991
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:00,900
你虛構出金姆斯·莫裏亞蒂  所謂的夙敵
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.

992
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,970
虛構出來的
Invented him?!

993
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,800
事實上所有的罪案都是他策劃的
He invented all the crimes, actually.

994
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:06,100
最厲害的是憑空造出一位犯罪大師
And to cap it all, he made up a master villain.

995
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:08,320
- 這太扯了  - 問他啊
- Don't be ridiculous! - Ask him.

996
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,170
他就在這裏  問他啊
He's right here. Just ask him.

997
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,760
- 告訴他  理查  - 得了吧  他上過庭
- Tell him, Richard. - For God's sake, this man was on trial!

998
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,430
沒錯  就是你付錢讓他背黑鍋
Yes, and you paid him, pay him to take the rap.

999
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:17,260
還保證搞定陪審團
Promised you'd rig the jury.

1000
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,800
雖然不是倫敦西區的角色  但我猜錢也不少
Not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good.

1001
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:23,310
但也不夠多  否則他不會爆料
But not so good he didn't want to sell his story.

1002
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:26,040
對不起  誠心的  非常抱歉
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry.

1003
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,790
你準備發表的就是這個故事
So this is the story you're going to publish?

1004
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,450
最後的結論就是
The big conclusion of it all,

1005
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:31,780
莫裏亞蒂只是個演員
Moriarty's an actor?

1006
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:32,790
他心裏明白
He knows I am.

1007
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,810
我有證據  有證據  給他們看...
I have proof. I have proof. Show them...

1008
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,780
姬蒂  給他們看看
Kitty, show them something.

1009
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:36,640
好啊  拿出來我看看
Yeah, show me something.

1010
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,430
我上過電視  是兒童頻道
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV.

1011
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,080
我講故事
I'm the story- teller.

1012
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,240
理查·布魯克

1013
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,860
獲獎演員參演熱門醫療劇

1014
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,570
我講故事  出過DVD
I'm the story- teller. It's on DVD.

1015
01:00:58,650 --> 01:00:59,370
理查·布魯克
簡歷

1016
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,800
告訴他
Just tell him.

1017
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,080
反正都這樣了  不用瞞了
It's all coming out. It's all over.

1018
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,650
告訴他們  說啊  說啊  還瞞什麼啊
Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell them! It's all over now!

1019
01:01:06,650 --> 01:01:09,530
不要  別碰我  你休想碰我
No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me!

1020
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,340
你耍夠了吧
Stop it now!

1021
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,080
別傷害我  不要讓他過來
Don't hurt me! Don't let him get away!

1022
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,990
放過他
Leave him alone!

1023
01:01:20,350 --> 01:01:21,810
不行不行  他還有後援
No, no, no. He'll have back- up.

1024
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,300
你知道嗎  夏洛克·福爾摩斯
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?

1025
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,670
我現在算是看透你了  你讓我噁心
I look at you know and I can read you... and you repel me.

1026
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,270
他真能做到嗎
Can he do that?

1027
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,770
徹底改變身份  把你抹黑成罪犯
Completely change his identity, make you the criminal?

1028
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:39,890
他徹底掌握了我的情況
He's got my whole life story.

1029
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,370
要想兜售一個天大的謊言
That's what you do when you sell a big lie,

1030
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:44,880
將其包裹在真相之中  看上去無懈可擊
you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.

1031
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,940
這只是你的一家之言了
It'll be your word against his.

1032
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,350
他用一天時間在人們腦袋裏埋下懷疑的種子
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours.

1033
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:51,060
再做一件事
There's only one thing

1034
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,750
就能結束這場遊戲  那就是...
he needs to do to complete his game and that...

1035
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,210
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1036
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,050
我要去做一件事
There's something I need to do.

1037
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:00,660
- 什麼事  我能幫忙嗎  - 不  我得一個人干
- What? Can I help? - No, on my own.

1038
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:19,850
你之前說錯了  知道嗎
You're wrong, you know?

1039
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,140
你的確算數
You do count.

1040
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,150
你一直都算數  我始終相信你
You've always counted and I've always trusted you.

1041
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,680
但你也說對了
But you were right.

1042
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:34,500
我的確有事
I'm not OK.

1043
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:36,850
你怎麼了
Tell me what's wrong.

1044
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,300
茉莉  我可能快死了
Molly, I think I'm going to die.

1045
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:45,700
你需要什麼
What do you need?

1046
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,770
如果我不是你所以為的樣子
If I wasn't everything that you think I am,

1047
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,680
甚至不是我所以為的樣子
everything that I think I am...

1048
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,720
你還願意幫我嗎
would you still want to help me?

1049
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,580
你需要什麼
What do you need?

1050
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,500
你
You.

1051
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,320
她真的做了不少功課  那個萊利小姐
She has really done her homework, Miss Riley,

1052
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,390
這些事只有和夏洛克最親近的人才知道
and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know.

1053
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,270
你最近有沒有看過你弟弟的通訊錄
Have you seen your brother's address book lately?

1054
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,310
只有兩個名字  你跟我
Two names... yours and mine...

1055
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,590
而莫裏亞蒂不是從我這裏得到的
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.

1056
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,420
- 約翰  - 怎麼回事  你們什麼關係
- John... - So how does it work, your relationship?

1057
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:45,830
你們是不是偶爾出去喝喝咖啡  你跟金
Do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim?

1058
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,340
你的親弟弟
Your own brother

1059
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:54,520
你把他的生平故事都告訴了這個瘋子
and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac.

1060
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,990
我根本沒打算...我根本沒想過...
I never intend... I never dreamt...

1061
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,880
你當時就是想跟我說這件事吧
This... this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it?

1062
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,960
"照看好他  因為我犯了個錯"
"Watch his back because I've made a mistake."

1063
01:04:10,190 --> 01:04:11,020
你怎麼認識他的
How did you meet him?

1064
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:19,300
他這樣的人  我們很瞭解  盡在掌控之中
People like him, we know about them, we watch them.

1065
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:22,760
但是金姆斯·莫裏亞蒂
But James Moriarty...

1066
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,160
擁有前所未有的犯罪頭腦
the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen,

1067
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,840
以及最終極的武器
and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.

1068
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,770
程序代碼
The key code.

1069
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,060
區區幾行程序就能暢通無阻
A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door.

1070
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,670
你綁架他就是為了套出代碼
And you abducted him to try and find the key code?

1071
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,050
我們對他審問了數周
Interrogated him for weeks.

1072
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:50,010
- 結果呢  - 他不合作
- And? - He wouldn't play along.

1073
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:52,770
他只是坐著
He just sat there

1074
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,190
凝視著黑暗
staring into the darkness.

1075
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,300
唯一能讓他開口的是...
The only thing that made him open up...

1076
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:10,250
我可以讓他說話  就一點點
I could get him to talk, just a little.

1077
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,930
可是...
But...

1078
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:17,210
作為回報  你把夏洛克的故事透露給他
In return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story.

1079
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,030
所以  這個天大的謊言
So, one big lie...

1080
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,930
夏洛克是個騙子
Sherlock's a fraud,

1081
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,800
人們會相信  因為別的部分都是真的
and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true.

1082
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:32,490
莫裏亞蒂想要毀了夏洛克
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right,

1083
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:37,700
而你給他送去了最強力的武器
and you have given him the perfect ammunition.

1084
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:45,240
約翰
John.

1085
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,390
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1086
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:52,760
算了吧
Please!

1087
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,690
轉告他  好嗎
Tell him, would you?

1088
01:06:08,350 --> 01:06:09,100
我收到你的短信
I got your message.

1089
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,060
程序代碼是問題的關鍵
The computer code is the key to this.

1090
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:11,860
把它找出來並加以使用
We find it, we can use it.

1091
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,400
用莫裏亞蒂的方式擊敗他
Beat Moriarty in his own game.

1092
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:14,260
你說使用是什麼意思
What do you mean use it?

1093
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,820
他用來編造了一個假身份
He used it to create a false identity

1094
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:19,230
我們也能篡改記錄  銷毀理查·布魯克
so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.

1095
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,790
把金·莫裏亞蒂逼回來
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.

1096
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,150
他無罪釋放那天
Somewhere in 221b,

1097
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,270
他把代碼藏在了221B的某個地方
somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden.

1098
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,880
- 他碰過什麼  - 一個蘋果  僅此而已
- What did he touch? - An apple, nothing else.

1099
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,080
- 他寫了什麼嗎  - 沒有
- Did he write anything down? - No.

1100
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:54,410
\h過來玩吧
\h\h\h巴茨醫院樓頂
夏·福

1101
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,790
順便
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h帶了你也許想拿回去的東西

1102
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:25,750
是我  請講
Yeah, speaking.

1103
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:27,630
什麼
What?

1104
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,690
怎麼了  她沒事吧
What happened? Is she OK?

1105
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,670
不是吧  好  我這就來
My God! Right, yes, I'm coming.

1106
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,160
- 什麼事  - 是醫護人員
- What is it? - Paramedics.

1107
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:36,460
赫德森太太受到了槍擊
Mrs Hudson's been shot.

1108
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:37,190
怎麼回事
What? How?

1109
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:40,540
沒準是你引來的那些殺手  天啊
Probably one of the killers you managed to attract. Jesus! Jesus!

1110
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:41,910
她不行了  夏洛克  走吧
She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go.

1111
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:42,590
你去  我很忙
You go. I'm busy.

1112
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:45,840
- 忙  - 思考  我需要思考
- Busy?! - Thinking. I need to think.

1113
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,030
你需要...你一點兒都不關心她嗎
You need to...? Doesn't she mean anything to you?

1114
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,370
上回有人碰了碰她  你就差點把他殺了
You once half- killed a man because he laid a finger on her.

1115
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,380
- 她是我房東  - 她快死了
- She's my landlady. - She's dying...

1116
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,570
你太冷血了
you machine!

1117
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:58,680
活見鬼  你就留在這裏吧  隨你便
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own.

1118
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,440
我只有孤獨作伴  孤獨能保護我
Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.

1119
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,670
不對  保護我們的是朋友
No, friends protect people.

1120
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:12,350
\h\h\h我在等著你哦
金·莫

1121
01:08:38,730 --> 01:08:39,580
好了
Well...

1122
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:42,800
終於見面了
here we are at last.

1123
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:46,000
就我們倆  夏洛克
You and me, Sherlock.

1124
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:49,370
我們的問題  終極問題
And our problem... the final problem.

1125
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,590
活著
Staying alive!

1126
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:56,110
無聊透頂吧
It's so boring, isn't it?

1127
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,700
一成不變
It's just staying.

1128
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:05,600
我這輩子都在找樂子
All my life I've been searching for distractions

1129
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,570
你曾經那麼有趣  現在也沒意思了
and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you

1130
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:10,090
因為我打敗了你
because I've beaten you.

1131
01:09:10,860 --> 01:09:11,870
你知道嗎
And you know what?

1132
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:13,510
說到底  太簡單了
In the end, it was easy.

1133
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,480
沒勁
It was easy.

1134
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,550
我只能回去找普通人玩了
Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people,

1135
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:22,290
而到頭來  你也不過和他們一樣是個普通人
and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them.

1136
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:26,760
好吧
Well.

1137
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:31,860
你是不是開始懷疑我是不是真的了
Did you almost start to wonder if I was real?

1138
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:34,600
你是不是也被我耍了啊
Did I nearly get you?

1139
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,160
理查·布魯克
Richard Brook.

1140
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,920
沒人看出其中的亮點  但你看出來了
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.

1141
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,990
- 當然了  - 真不錯
- Of course. - Attaboy.

1142
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:45,890
理查·布魯克的德語就是萊辛巴赫
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.

1143
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,760
- 那個讓我出名的案子  - 只是覺得這樣很好玩啦
- The case that made my name. - Just trying to have some fun.

1144
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,780
不錯啊  你這也看出來了
Good. You got that too.

1145
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,460
數字一樣的節奏
Beats like digits.

1146
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:06,110
每一拍就是1  其餘的都是0
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.

1147
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:07,800
二進制代碼
Binary code.

1148
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,630
所以那些殺手都要救我
That's why all those assassins tried to save my life.

1149
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,060
代碼就藏在我身上  藏在我腦海裏
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.

1150
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:14,880
簡單的幾行程序代碼
A few simple lines of computer code

1151
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,080
就可以破解任何系統
that can break into any system.

1152
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:21,520
我對那些客戶說  最後一名是膽小鬼
Told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy.

1153
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,360
但現在我都知道了  我能用這個修改記錄
But now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records.

1154
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:30,750
我能抹殺理查·布魯克  弄回金·莫裏亞蒂
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.

1155
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:36,720
不不不  這也太簡單了
No, no, no, no, no. This is too easy.

1156
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:38,380
太簡單了
This is too easy.

1157
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:41,360
根本就沒什麼代碼  笨蛋
There is no key, doofus!

1158
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,860
那些數字毫無意義  一點意義都沒有
Those digits are meaningless. They're utterly meaningless.

1159
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,540
你不會真以為幾行程序代碼
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code

1160
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:53,450
就能破解全世界的系統嗎
are going to crash the world around our ears?

1161
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:57,320
我好失望哦  普通人夏洛克
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.

1162
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:02,450
- 但那個節奏  - 是巴赫的1號協奏曲  謝謝
- But the rhythm... Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.

1163
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,070
- 那你又是怎麼...  - 怎麼黑進銀行
- But then how did you... ? - How did I break into the bank,

1164
01:11:05,070 --> 01:11:06,590
倫敦塔  還有監獄嗎
to the Tower, to the prison?

1165
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:11,100
光天化日下的搶劫  只要有同夥就行啦
Daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants.

1166
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,200
好戲開始了哦

1167
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,990
我知道你會上鉤  這是你的弱點
I knew you'd fall for it. That's your weakness.

1168
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,730
你總是把事情想得很聰明
You always want everything to be clever.

1169
01:11:21,730 --> 01:11:24,890
我們的遊戲能結束了嗎  最後一幕
Shall we finish the game? One final act.

1170
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:28,440
幸好你選了一棟高樓  那樣做效果很好
Glad you chose a tall building. Nice way to do it.

1171
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,490
做  做什麼
Do it? Do what?

1172
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,070
是啊  當然了
Yes, of course.

1173
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:38,720
自殺
My suicide.

1174
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:41,070
天才偵探是個騙子
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.

1175
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,680
我在報紙上看到  肯定是真的
I read it in the paper so it must be true.

1176
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,500
我最愛報紙了
I love newspapers.

1177
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,980
還有童話故事
Fairy tales.

1178
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,940
尤其喜歡黑暗的童話
And pretty grim ones too.

1179
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:06,570
天啊  約翰  你嚇死我了  警察那邊沒事吧
God, John, you made me jump. Is everything OK with the police?

1180
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,270
夏洛克都解決了吧
Has Sherlock sorted it all out?

1181
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,330
我的天
My God.

1182
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,860
出租車
Taxi!

1183
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,900
出租車  等等  我是警察  算是吧
Taxi! No, no, no. Police... sort of!

1184
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,060
謝了  夥計  太謝謝了
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot!

1185
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,280
我能證明你偽造了那個假身份
I can prove that you created an entirely false identity.

1186
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:30,020
你就自殺吧  那樣省力多了
Just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort.

1187
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:33,060
跳啊
Go on.

1188
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,390
為了我
For me.

1189
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:37,870
好不好啦
Please!

1190
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:44,190
你瘋了
You're insane.

1191
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:47,090
你剛剛知道嗎
You're just getting that now? Wo- wo- wo!

1192
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:48,870
好吧
Ok.

1193
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,950
我再給你點動力
Let me give you a little extra incentive.

1194
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:56,190
要是你不跳  你朋友就會死
Your friends will die if you don't.

1195
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,180
- 約翰  - 不止是約翰  還有
- John? - Not just John. Everyone.

1196
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,800
- 赫德森太太  - 還有
- Mrs Hudson? - Everyone.

1197
01:13:04,690 --> 01:13:10,640
- 雷斯垂德  - 三發子彈  三個殺手  三個死者
- Lestrade? - Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims.

1198
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,970
沒有人能阻止他們了
There's no stopping them now...

1199
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:17,450
除非他們看到你跳樓
unless my people see you jump.

1200
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,810
儘管逮捕我  折磨我好了
You can have me arrested, you can torture me,

1201
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:30,860
你想拿我怎麼樣隨便你
you can do anything you like with me,

1202
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,670
但沒什麼能阻止他們扣下扳機
but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.

1203
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:37,360
你在這世上唯一的三個朋友死定了
Your only three friends in the world will die unless...

1204
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,880
- 除非  - 我自殺  成就你的故事
- Unless... - I kill myself and complete your story.

1205
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:44,020
你得承認  這樣更吸引人
You've got to admit, that's sexier.

1206
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:48,930
- 我聲名狼藉地死去  - 當然了  這才是重點
- And I die in disgrace. - Of course. That's the point of this.

1207
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,370
你現在有觀眾了哦
You've got an audience now.

1208
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,350
請吧
Off you pop.

1209
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,740
跳吧
Go on.

1210
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,500
我告訴過你故事的結局
I told you how this ends.

1211
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:07,100
只有你死
Your death is the only thing

1212
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,150
殺手才會收手
that's going to call off the killers.

1213
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,580
我肯定不會這麼做
I'm certainly not going to do it.

1214
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:16,760
你能給我點時間嗎
Would you give me one moment, please?

1215
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,770
讓我一個人待會
One moment of privacy.

1216
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:22,110
拜託了
Please.

1217
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:26,250
當然可以
Of course.

1218
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:51,470
什麼
What?!

1219
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:53,530
你笑什麼
What is it?

1220
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,040
你知道了什麼
What did I miss?

1221
01:15:01,490 --> 01:15:03,210
你不會這麼做
You're not going to do it.

1222
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,070
所以還有辦法讓殺手收手
So the killers can be called off,

1223
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:08,720
有個代碼  暗號或數字
then there's a recall code or a word or a number.

1224
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,620
如果我有你
I don't have to die

1225
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:15,770
我就不用死
if I've got you.

1226
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:20,290
你覺得你能讓我下令讓他們住手嗎
You think you can make me stop the order?

1227
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:22,930
- 你覺得你能做到嗎  - 當然
- You think you can make me do that? - Yes.

1228
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:28,110
- 你也這麼覺得  - 夏洛克  你哥哥和整個政府的人
- So do you. - Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses

1229
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:30,080
都不能逼我做我不想做的事
couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to.

1230
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:32,410
是的  但我不是我哥哥  記得嗎
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember?

1231
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,790
我是你
I am you.

1232
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:37,930
準備好做任何事
Prepared to do anything.

1233
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:40,100
準備好毀滅一切
Prepared to burn.

1234
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,420
準備好做普通人做不到的事
Prepared to do what ordinary people won't do.

1235
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,010
你想和我在地獄裏相見嗎
You want me to shake hands with you in hell?

1236
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:48,280
那我奉陪
I shall not disappoint you.

1237
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,140
不
Nah.

1238
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,610
你這話說大了
You talk big.

1239
01:15:55,990 --> 01:15:57,210
才不是呢
Nah.

1240
01:15:57,340 --> 01:15:58,900
你是普通人
You're ordinary.

1241
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,380
你是普通人  你站在正義那一方
You're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels.

1242
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,880
我也許是站在正義那一方
I may be on the side of the angels,

1243
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:11,010
但這絕不代表我和他們是一種人
but don't think for one second that I am one of them.

1244
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,930
對
No...

1245
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,160
你不是
you're not.

1246
01:16:30,630 --> 01:16:31,710
我懂了
I see.

1247
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:35,310
你不是普通人
You're not ordinary.

1248
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,200
不是
No.

1249
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,250
你是我
You're me.

1250
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,050
你就是我
You're me.

1251
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:47,670
謝謝
Thank you...

1252
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,090
夏洛克·福爾摩斯
Sherlock Holmes.

1253
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,510
謝謝你了
Thank you.

1254
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,640
上帝保佑你
Bless you.

1255
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:09,480
只要我還活著
As long as I'm alive,

1256
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:12,680
你就能救你的朋友  你就會有退路
you can save your friends, you've got a way out.

1257
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,370
那就祝你好運了
Well, good luck with that.

1258
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,050
不
No.

1259
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,780
是的  先生  謝謝  再見
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye.

1260
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,790
喂
Hello?

1261
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,910
- 約翰  - 夏洛克  你沒事吧
- John. - Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK?

1262
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:45,530
轉過身  往回走  我這就來
Turn around and walk back the way you came. I'm coming in.

1263
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:48,150
照我說的做
Just do as I ask!

1264
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,780
求你了
Please.

1265
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:50,850
在哪
Where?

1266
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:54,250
停在那別動
Stop there.

1267
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,790
- 夏洛克  - 好了  抬頭  我在屋頂上
- Sherlock? - OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop.

1268
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:00,750
天啊
God.

1269
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:05,670
我不能下來  所以我們只能這麼說話了
I... I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this.

1270
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:07,970
怎麼了
What's going on?

1271
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:09,440
我要道歉
An apology.

1272
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,270
這一切都是真的
It's all true.

1273
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,730
什麼
What?

1274
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,050
他們說的關於我的一切  我創造了莫裏亞蒂
Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty.

1275
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,130
你為什麼要這麼說
Why are you saying this?

1276
01:19:32,430 --> 01:19:33,720
我是個冒牌貨
I'm a fake.

1277
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:37,640
- 夏洛克  - 報紙上寫的都是真的
- Sherlock... - The newspapers were right all along.

1278
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:40,650
我要你告訴雷斯垂德
I want you to tell Lestrade,

1279
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:44,120
告訴赫德森太太和茉莉
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.

1280
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,890
告訴所有相信你的人
In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you...

1281
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,860
我為了自己創造了莫裏亞蒂
that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.

1282
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,130
好了  閉嘴  夏洛克  別說了
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up.

1283
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,070
我們第一次見面的時候
The first time we met... the first time we met,

1284
01:19:59,070 --> 01:20:02,730
- 你就對我姐姐的事瞭如指掌吧  - 沒人能這麼聰明
- you knew all about my sister, right? - Nobody could be that clever.

1285
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:04,040
你就可以
You could.

1286
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:14,420
我調查了你
I researched you.

1287
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,360
我們見面之前  我查了所有關於你的資料
Before we met, I discovered everything that I could

1288
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,740
就為了讓你印象深刻
to impress you.

1289
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:24,630
這只是個把戲罷了
It's a trick. Just a magic trick.

1290
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,010
不  快別說了
No. All right, stop it now.

1291
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:29,750
不  站在那別動
No. Stay exactly where you are.

1292
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,340
- 別動  - 好吧
- Don't move. - All right.

1293
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:36,430
好好看著我
Keep your eyes fixed on me.

1294
01:20:37,330 --> 01:20:39,780
- 求你了  你能為我做這件事嗎  - 什麼事
- Please, will you do this for me? - Do what?

1295
01:20:40,740 --> 01:20:42,410
這通電話
This phone call, it's...

1296
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,100
是我的遺言
it's my note.

1297
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,340
人們都會這麼做的吧
It's what people do, don't they?

1298
01:20:51,950 --> 01:20:53,120
留遺言
Leave a note?

1299
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,830
留什麼鬼遺言啊
Leave a note when?

1300
01:20:57,860 --> 01:21:00,800
- 再見  約翰  - 不  不要
- Goodbye, John. - No. Don't...

1301
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,350
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1302
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:17,790
夏洛克
Sherlock.

1303
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:06,890
夏洛克
Sherlock... Sherlock.

1304
01:22:08,860 --> 01:22:11,980
我是醫生  讓我過去  快讓我過去
I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please.

1305
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:15,170
他是我朋友  是我朋友  求求你們
He's my friend. He's my friend... Please.

1306
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,180
求你們了  讓我...
Please, let me just...

1307
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,240
上帝啊
Jesus!

1308
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,530
不
No.

1309
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,280
這不是真的
God, no.

1310
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:51,320
冒牌天才自殺

1311
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,240
你有什麼想說
There's stuff that you wanted to say...

1312
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:31,020
- 卻沒有說的話  - 嗯
- but didn't say it. - Yeah.

1313
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,160
現在說出來吧
Say it now.

1314
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:45,020
對不起  我做不到
Sorry, I can't.

1315
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,310
所有那些東西  那些科學儀器
There's all the stuff. All the science equipment.

1316
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:01,500
我都裝在盒子裏了  不知道該怎麼辦
I left it all in boxes. I don't know what needs doing.

1317
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,750
我覺得還是捐給學校吧
I thought I'd take it to a school.

1318
01:25:05,290 --> 01:25:06,140
你要不要...
Would you...?

1319
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:09,480
我現在暫時沒法回去  我要緩一緩
I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment.

1320
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,440
我好生氣
I'm angry.

1321
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:17,720
沒事的  約翰  這沒什麼奇怪
It's OK, John. There's nothing unusual in that.

1322
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:20,000
他讓每個人都生氣
That's the way he made everyone feel.

1323
01:25:18,950 --> 01:25:32,550
夏洛克·福爾摩斯

1324
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:24,010
看他在我桌子上留下的記號  還有那些噪音
All the marks on my table and the noise,

1325
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:27,350
- 在凌晨一點半開槍  - 是啊
- firing guns at half past one in the morning... - Yeah.

1326
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:29,550
還把該死的標本放在我冰箱裏
Bloody specimens in my fridge.

1327
01:25:29,550 --> 01:25:32,520
- 你怎麼能在放吃的地方放屍體  - 是啊
- Imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. - Yes.

1328
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,670
還打架  還把牆壁弄得亂七八糟
And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings- on.

1329
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:39,410
聽著  我其實沒有這麼生氣  好嗎
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK?

1330
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:43,100
好吧  我讓你一個人待會
OK. I'll leave you alone to, you know...

1331
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:01,550
你曾經對我說過
You... you told me once...

1332
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,770
你不是個英雄
that you weren't a hero.

1333
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,360
我也曾一度以為你不是人
There were times I didn't even think you were human,

1334
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,640
但我要對你說  你是...
but let me tell you this, you were...

1335
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,640
我認識的...
the best man...

1336
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:18,250
最出色...最有人情味的人
the most human... human being that I've ever known

1337
01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:22,110
沒有人能讓我相信  你對我說的這一切都是在騙我
and no- one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so...

1338
01:26:23,530 --> 01:26:24,600
就這樣
there.

1339
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:34,540
我好孤單
I was so alone...

1340
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,950
我欠你好多
and I owe you so much.

1341
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,800
但是  求你了  再求你一件事  就一件事
But, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing,

1342
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,960
就一個奇跡  夏洛克  為了我  求你不要...
one more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don't be...

1343
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:52,810
不要死
dead.

1344
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,770
可以嗎  就當是為了我
Would you do that just for me?

1345
01:26:55,770 --> 01:26:58,300
別這樣  不要這麼對我
Just stop it. Stop this.

1346
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:59,230
