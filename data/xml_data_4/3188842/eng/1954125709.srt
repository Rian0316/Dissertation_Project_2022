1
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:04,200
Previously,
on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:04,201 --> 00:00:06,684
This town
was my home once,

3
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:09,074
and in my absence,
Marcel has got

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,656
everything
I ever wanted.

5
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:12,285
I want it back.

6
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:14,126
Marcel: I hereby pledge
my allegiance to you.

7
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:16,729
- Celeste.
- Celeste?

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,063
Whoever she was,
she was smoking hot.

9
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:20,431
I believe that when
you love someone,

10
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:21,867
you're uniquely
vulnerable.

11
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:23,169
She died because of me.

12
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,870
Klaus: Davina,
she's a powerful weapon.

13
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,238
Yaah!

14
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:27,540
I knew that I was supposed
to be killed

15
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:30,509
so the harvest
could be completed.

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,344
Marcel: She is dead!
Do you hear me?

17
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,936
Rebekah: 4 were supposed
to rise, and none did.

18
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:38,063
Where did
all that power go?

19
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:41,186
- Tunde: Someone called us forth.
- Who?

20
00:00:41,187 --> 00:00:42,721
Celeste: I did.

21
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:45,153
I'd appreciate if you
call me by my real name...

22
00:00:45,154 --> 00:00:47,225
Celeste.

23
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,899
Oh...

24
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,768
I remember
this cemetery.

25
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:59,404
Hmm. Hasn't
changed a bit.

26
00:00:59,405 --> 00:01:01,545
I've been coming here
over a century

27
00:01:01,546 --> 00:01:03,879
wearing one face
or another.

28
00:01:22,828 --> 00:01:24,962
[Drums playing]

29
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:30,101
Clara Summerlin,
will you come on?

30
00:01:30,102 --> 00:01:32,637
We're gonna miss
everything.

31
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:35,577
[People cheering and whistling]

32
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,634
Genevieve:
Told you.

33
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:51,720
Every witch in
the quarter is here,

34
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:54,304
come to see the
great Papa Tunde.

35
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:05,941
[Drums stop]

36
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:18,549
Witches of the french quarter,

37
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,457
thank you for your welcome.

38
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,584
It is good to be
among people of the faith.

39
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:25,023
I, too, practice
ancestral magic,

40
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:28,059
honoring those who walked
the path before us.

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,674
From them we draw strength...

42
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,221
And you will need strength,

43
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:36,348
for a great darkness is coming.

44
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,870
The city your forefathers
left you is now overrun

45
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:41,977
by pirates, beasts,
and vampires.

46
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:55,824
[Wind whistling]

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,560
Tunde: I practice
other magic, as well...

48
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,000
Sacrificial magic.

49
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,330
Channeling power
from the lives of my offerings,

50
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:08,566
I use this strength
to vanquish my enemies,

51
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:12,174
and I will punish your enemies
for their greed.

52
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:18,841
In return, you will accept
my family into your coven...

53
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:24,686
And me as your leader.

54
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:33,190
Gentlemen,
make yourselves at home.

55
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,333
Mayor O'Connell appears
to be running late,

56
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:37,361
but there's much to discuss,
so I shall begin.

57
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:39,896
Klaus: One moment,
please, brother.

58
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,999
You know
how much I enjoy

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,267
these illicit,
little gatherings.

60
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:45,836
Do not be troubled.

61
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:47,738
Despite my brother's
reputation, I can assure you,

62
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,421
we've invited you here
to broker in peace.

63
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,974
You have my word.

64
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,109
And, lucky for you,

65
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,466
my brother always
keeps his word.

66
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:00,583
You two are from
the guerrera crime family,

67
00:04:00,584 --> 00:04:03,654
a brutish pack
of thieves and killers,

68
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:05,622
and that's nothing compared
to what you become

69
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,124
on a full moon,
is it?

70
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,258
Yes, yes, yes.

71
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,860
Of course,
a bite from your kind

72
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:11,461
is not lethal
to an original.

73
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:13,630
Conflict between us
would not

74
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:15,832
end well
for you at all.

75
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,234
Let's state
our proposal here.

76
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:19,451
My brother and I control
the ports of the city,

77
00:04:19,452 --> 00:04:21,471
but with prohibition
soon to be the law

78
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:23,707
of the land, there'll be
a certain uptick

79
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,310
in the kind of federal
presence we prefer to avoid.

80
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,646
Therefore, I'd like
to suggest a system

81
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,648
whereby... under our
supervision, of course...

82
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:34,784
The guerrera family
can traffic alcohol

83
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:36,920
into the city of
New Orleans for a profit.

84
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:38,555
We would still be
in charge,

85
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:42,125
but our rule would
remain a secret.

86
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:44,260
[Clap clap clap]

87
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,162
Tunde: This all
sounds very good,

88
00:04:46,163 --> 00:04:47,897
but, tell me,

89
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,522
how will it benefit
the witches?

90
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,633
I am sorry.
This is a private meeting.

91
00:04:52,151 --> 00:04:54,611
Yes, for kings
of the city,

92
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,639
but I, too,
am a King,

93
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,240
and I
have rules.

94
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:01,143
I'm impressed.

95
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:04,329
You're either quite ambitious
or quite mad.

96
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,206
What's your name, mate?

97
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:09,151
I am Alphonz
Bellatunde Delgallo,

98
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:11,487
Papa Tunde
to my followers,

99
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:12,922
and I come to ask
that the witches

100
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,290
be granted
fair tribute

101
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,339
for allowing your
existence in our city.

102
00:05:16,827 --> 00:05:18,628
Are you suggesting
that you speak

103
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,595
for the french
quarter witches?

104
00:05:20,596 --> 00:05:22,764
I do now, and I expect

105
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:25,868
our future negotiations
to go very smoothly.

106
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:29,871
As a guarantee,
I brought a gift.

107
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:37,485
I await our
next gathering.

108
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:55,128
Well, I suppose
we'll need a new mayor.

109
00:05:57,415 --> 00:06:01,987

110
00:06:02,574 --> 00:06:05,641
Hey, Marcel, maybe you
know what's going on.

111
00:06:05,642 --> 00:06:07,610
Klaus ordered us
to meet here,

112
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,911
and now he's
a no-show.

113
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,479
What do you
want from me?

114
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,730
It's a new regime.
Get used to it.

115
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:19,621
Klaus: Dearest brethren,
your attention, please.

116
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:23,524
No doubt, you're all surprised
to see Thierry Vanchure,

117
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:25,326
who's supposed to be rotting
in the garden

118
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,363
for the crime of killing
one of our own,

119
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:31,400
and I personally decided
to issue him with a pardon.

120
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:35,571
I hope you'll all
welcome home Thierry.

121
00:06:35,572 --> 00:06:37,439
Welcome home, mate.

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,382
[Applause]

123
00:06:40,777 --> 00:06:42,427
[Laughter]

124
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:44,946
You're in a good mood.

125
00:06:45,347 --> 00:06:47,182
You should visit
Mystic Falls more often.

126
00:06:47,183 --> 00:06:48,617
Well, as much
as I might like to,

127
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,850
I have pressing
responsibilities here.

128
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:56,524
Now, as you all know,

129
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,293
the witch Davina
is no longer with us.

130
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,528
Without Davina, we can
no longer monitor

131
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,491
the activity
of our witch neighbors.

132
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:08,070
However, since
their harvest failed,

133
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:11,164
their magic will soon
be gone forever.

134
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,376
Until then, I say we
keep them on their toes.

135
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:18,545
Diego, I wonder
if you might lead

136
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,338
a rousting
in the cauldron.

137
00:07:25,587 --> 00:07:28,932
Marcel, I'd hoped
you would join Diego.

138
00:07:28,933 --> 00:07:31,091
Nah.

139
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,561
I'm gonna take
a personal day.

140
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,025
Elijah: Now,
you may doubt him.

141
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:41,002
Today I saw Niklaus
demonstrate mercy

142
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,537
towards an enemy.

143
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:44,105
Tell me
that's not progress.

144
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,573
Please, Elijah.

145
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:47,342
Who do you think convinced
Klaus to let Thierry out?

146
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:50,178
Why would you do
such a thing?

147
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:51,880
Because, despite
Klaus' reprieve,

148
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,315
Thierry despises him.

149
00:07:54,316 --> 00:07:55,583
I like that
about Thierry.

150
00:07:55,584 --> 00:07:56,951
I also like that he
used to date a witch,

151
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,120
so he knows about
french quarter covens.

152
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,455
Maybe he can lead me
to whoever

153
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:01,990
stole off with
the harvest magic.

154
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:03,258
Rebekah, we are
all devastated

155
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,792
by the outcome
of this ritual.

156
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,594
That's just it.
There was no outcome.

157
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:09,864
We both know that power
like that doesn't just vanish.

158
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,333
I say someone
stole it.

159
00:08:12,334 --> 00:08:13,735
I'd like to know who,

160
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:15,770
and then I'd like to make
an ally out of them.

161
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:19,040
To what end,
exactly?

162
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,942
I'm tired of
being threatened

163
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:22,986
and controlled by
our tyrant brother.

164
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:25,346
If you want
to stop a bully,

165
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:26,948
you need the power
to stand up to them.

166
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:28,583
I expect such behavior
from Niklaus.

167
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,017
It's so very disappointing
when it comes

168
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:31,743
from you, Rebekah.

169
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,020
Do you not see
that, in his way,

170
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:36,123
he's making
an effort here?

171
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,359
He's invited us back
into our family home.

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,728
He yearns for our family
to be reunited.

173
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,163
Yes. He's in a
brilliant mood now,

174
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:43,254
but for how long?

175
00:08:43,765 --> 00:08:45,466
It's his trick, Elijah.

176
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:48,002
He lulls you
into a false sense

177
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:49,503
of camaraderie
and kinship,

178
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:51,972
and then he turns
on you like a snake.

179
00:08:51,973 --> 00:08:53,240
I fall for it
every time

180
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,575
and wind up with
a dagger in my chest

181
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,910
for my trouble.

182
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,344
No more.

183
00:08:57,345 --> 00:08:58,679
I believe that he
is approaching

184
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,314
some semblance
of peace here.

185
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:02,400
Leadership may, in fact,
be a good thing for him.

186
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:04,859
Now, sister, please,
I ask you,

187
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,520
if you cannot
support him,

188
00:09:06,521 --> 00:09:10,573
then at least do nothing
to provoke him.

189
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,765
Klaus: Ugh, is this
what's it's come to?

190
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,199
I bear the full weight
of our kingdom

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,000
while you pout
like a child.

192
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,503
You wanted to be King.

193
00:09:22,504 --> 00:09:24,505
Besides, you look
like you guy it covered.

194
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:26,507
If the men see you
shirk your duties,

195
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:28,075
they're likely
to do the same.

196
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:31,477
I told you, I am not in
the mood for vampire Hijinx.

197
00:09:31,478 --> 00:09:33,547
No. You'd rather sit
wallowing in sorrow

198
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:35,115
for your lost
little friend.

199
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,717
Don't push me
right now.

200
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,886
I am sorry Davina
is gone, ok?

201
00:09:38,887 --> 00:09:40,854
I'm sorry, but this
mournful attitude

202
00:09:40,855 --> 00:09:44,458
is unworthy of you,
and it's boring to me.

203
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,444
Diego: Hey, guys,
we got a problem.

204
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:53,066
We came to mess
with the witches,

205
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,968
just like you said,

206
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,037
and these two,
they went missing,

207
00:09:57,038 --> 00:09:58,623
found them
like this...

208
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:01,332
Not even staked,
just dead.

209
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:09,648
Where are you going?

210
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:11,968
Someone has to account
for this.

211
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:17,473
You want revenge,
get it yourself.

212
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,728
That mark is tied
to some bad mojo.

213
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:23,462
Any of y'all got any brains,
you'll head back

214
00:10:23,463 --> 00:10:25,857
to the compound and stay
the hell out of this.

215
00:10:28,445 --> 00:10:29,611
[Thunder]

216
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,777
Klaus: We're gonna find
whoever did this,

217
00:10:37,778 --> 00:10:41,081
and I will show them
what suffering is.

218
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,949
Thierry: Used to run things
down here for Marcel.

219
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,318
Thought you'd like
to see what I found

220
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,337
before Klaus did.

221
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,987
Not a day
out of the garden,

222
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:49,389
and you're already
proving yourself useful.

223
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,508
We made a deal,

224
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,392
and if it screws things
or your brother,

225
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,794
I'm all for it,
though, to be honest,

226
00:10:54,795 --> 00:10:57,329
this stuff
makes my skin crawl.

227
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,500
I've never seen
anything like this.

228
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:02,935
I have,
a long time ago.

229
00:11:05,605 --> 00:11:08,359
Somebody is copycatting
a very dangerous witch.

230
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,676
They draw their power
from sacrifice.

231
00:11:10,677 --> 00:11:12,445
I just don't understand
why someone

232
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:15,365
would leave it here
for us to find...

233
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,520
Unless they wanted it
to be found.

234
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,832
Tunde:
Mademoiselle Mikaelson.

235
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,690
That's not possible.

236
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,393
Sure, it is, chérie. It's magic.

237
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,257
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrase-toi.

238
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,331
Embrase-toi.

239
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,268
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrase-toi.

240
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:38,179
Embrase-toi.

241
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,206
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrase-toi.

242
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:41,774
Embrase-toi.

243
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:45,011
Symbole du masque
et de l'ombre, embrase-toi.

244
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:46,845
Ah!

245
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,589
Klaus: Someone will die for this.

246
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,090
Remarkably,
I don't disagree.

247
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,258
However, I would
like to know

248
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:57,726
where they learned
such dark magic.

249
00:11:57,727 --> 00:12:00,429
I had hoped never to see
that symbol again.

250
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,264
I recall it is
the signature of a fool

251
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:03,898
who once stood
against us.

252
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,902
Clearly, some upstart witch
is salvaging old tricks.

253
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:09,771
I'll do for him
as I did the other.

254
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,087
Diego.

255
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,376
When night falls,
I want you to gather

256
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,644
every vampire
in the quarter.

257
00:12:16,645 --> 00:12:19,648
Get me the head
of whoever did this

258
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:21,391
and put it
on a stick.

259
00:12:21,392 --> 00:12:23,285
Yeah. That's gonna
be a problem.

260
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:25,353
Everyone is
freaked out, man.

261
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:27,089
We haven't had witches
killing vampires

262
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,623
in a long time.

263
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:30,459
Marcel made sure
of that.

264
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,192
Marcel has run off
like a scared child.

265
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,946
You lot are left
with me.

266
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,438
Now, who of you

267
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,038
will fight
to defend our home?

268
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:53,480
Not a single one of you
will stand with me,

269
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,350
so afraid are you
of this new threat?

270
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:00,386
You should know better.

271
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:05,433
I'll handle this myself.

272
00:13:09,898 --> 00:13:13,301
Cami: Sophie, the restaurant
is an epic disaster... again.

273
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:15,169
Do you think maybe
you could come in today and...

274
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,338
Voice: User's mailbox is full.
Good-bye.

275
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,573
Marcel: Looks like
I should've been

276
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:19,908
here last night.

277
00:13:19,909 --> 00:13:21,508
Before you try anything,
I'm on vervain.

278
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,977
Yeah. Klaus mentioned
you broke free

279
00:13:22,978 --> 00:13:24,076
of his compulsion.

280
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:27,248
Good for you.
Sophie around?

281
00:13:27,249 --> 00:13:28,664
No. Why?

282
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,334
Got a witch problem.
Thought she might have answers.

283
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:36,823
Mind if I wait?

284
00:13:38,926 --> 00:13:41,628
It's a little early
for day drinking.

285
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:44,432
Let me guess,
Klaus problems.

286
00:13:44,433 --> 00:13:46,533
I thought you'd be
on top of the world

287
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,728
now that you have
Davina back.

288
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:50,937
Davina is gone.

289
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,710
Was it Klaus?

290
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,320
I told him,
if he hurt her...

291
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:59,313
It wasn't like that.

292
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:01,482
The power that she
had was too much.

293
00:14:01,483 --> 00:14:03,184
We tried to fix her with
this crazy-ass ritual,

294
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:04,552
and something
went wrong.

295
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,220
Now she's...
I don't know...

296
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,521
Floating in limbo

297
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:09,724
or waiting
on her ancestors.

300
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,300
I'm sorry.

301
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:27,640
Yeah. Me, too.

302
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:35,715
There you are.

303
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,150
Here I am.

304
00:14:40,554 --> 00:14:43,241
Davina's drawings.

305
00:14:43,242 --> 00:14:46,093
Yeah. Morbid, I know.

306
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,061
I was just thinking,
we never figured out

307
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:51,165
why she drew those
pictures of Celeste.

308
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,599
Anyway, I'm just
killing time

309
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,635
now that I'm on
vampire lockdown.

310
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:56,270
Whoever did this,
we will deal with them.

311
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,671
It won't be long.

312
00:14:57,672 --> 00:15:00,007
I'm not worried.

313
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,241
Just think
it's kind of funny

314
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:03,277
that it took some big,
supernatural threat

315
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,279
for you to even come
into the same room as me.

316
00:15:09,017 --> 00:15:11,559
I do apologize
if you feel neglected.

317
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,819
I have been occupied.

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,489
My siblings
are in some quarrel.

agitated.

320
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,609
You'll recall that even
our slightest interactions

321
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:24,430
seem to...
Infuriate him.

322
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,934
So Klaus is a dick,

323
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,537
and you want to be
a good big brother.

324
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,974
So we can't
hang out.

325
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:36,475
That sum it up?

326
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,148
I get it, Elijah.

327
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,009
It just seems like a
really crappy deal.

El presidente?

330
00:15:56,097 --> 00:15:58,606
He likes to keep track
of his people.

331
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:01,300
Why are you loyal
to him, exactly?

332
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:03,169
For someone who says
she can't stand the guy,

333
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,471
you sure ask a lot
of questions about him.

334
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:08,974
My interest
is purely academic.

335
00:16:08,975 --> 00:16:11,110
I know what
you're doing.

336
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:12,679
You're mad he used you,

337
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,581
and you want
to get back at him.

338
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:15,682
Maybe you're hoping
I'll let slip

339
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,918
some chink
in his armor.

340
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,751
Friendly advice...
Don't do that.

341
00:16:19,286 --> 00:16:21,320
It won't end well.

342
00:16:25,302 --> 00:16:27,894
Let me tell you
a story about someone

343
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,529
who went up
against Klaus.

344
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,898

This was right after I returned

346
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,735
from world War I.

347
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:39,571
I'd been trying to get away
from New Orleans for a while.

348
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:47,780
Something kept drawing me back.

349
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:53,586
Why don't you get me
some Martinis?

350
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,621
Thank you.

351
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:02,127
Aren't you gonna
welcome me home?

352
00:17:02,128 --> 00:17:03,329
I wouldn't
want you to think

353
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,924
that I was happy
to see you.

354
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:07,051
How long
you gonna hate me?

00:17:07,052 --> 00:17:09,401
You left me in a box
for 52 years.

356
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:12,807
Twice that seems
like a good start.

357
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,975
Come on, boys.

358
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:22,147
Klaus: There he is...

359
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:25,584
Our war hero
triumphantly returned.

360
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,886
Oh, good to have you
back, Marcellus.

361
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:29,280
Welcome home.

362
00:17:33,537 --> 00:17:36,295
Mm. Ha ha!

363
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:39,063
The prodigal son has finally
learned to hold his liquor.

364
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,799
The army'll
do that to you.

365
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,100
Well, it's good
to have you back.

366
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:44,503
Niklaus was beside himself
in your absence.

367
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:46,438
Now that you are here,

368
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,551
perhaps you could help
settle an argument.

369
00:17:48,552 --> 00:17:50,509
You see, you've traded
a war abroad

370
00:17:50,977 --> 00:17:53,244
for one here
in the quarter.

371
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:57,115
Some rogue witch wants a piece
of the city we built,

372
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:01,086
and Elijah, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

373
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,656
insists that negotiation
is our best recourse.

374
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:06,792
Yes. On the topic of
your failed comprehension,

375
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,794
you forget,
as a soldier,

376
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:10,228
Marcel has seen
not only

377
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:11,864
how small
the world has become

378
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:13,298
and how fast
news can travel,

379
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,953
but also the very
horrors of war itself.

380
00:18:15,954 --> 00:18:18,002
Surely, Marcel
would agree with me.

381
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:20,138
The best way for us
to defend our home

382
00:18:20,139 --> 00:18:23,240
is by exercising
discretion.

383
00:18:23,241 --> 00:18:25,342
So who's the witch
you want to kill?

384
00:18:25,343 --> 00:18:28,013
His name is Papa Tunde.

385
00:18:28,014 --> 00:18:31,509
I think
he's a charlatan.

386
00:18:33,018 --> 00:18:35,120
Elijah: Well, Marcel
shall be able

387
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:37,855
to decide that
for himself.

388
00:18:40,437 --> 00:18:42,060
You invited him
here.

389
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:45,314
Of course.
We're not savages, are we?

390
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:54,038
Thank you for accepting
our invitation, and welcome.

391
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,492
I hope you'll allow me
to play the role of host.

392
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,160
If there's
anything you need...

393
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,041
Anything at all...

394
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:09,654
Pleasure before
business, then.

395
00:19:09,655 --> 00:19:10,840
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

396
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:15,221
Marcel, voice-over:
I didn't get it at first.

397
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:18,462
Klaus was the one
who wanted to go to war.

398
00:19:18,463 --> 00:19:21,798
So why was he inviting
his enemy into his home?

399
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:25,303
Why be so generous to someone
who he's gonna have to kill?

400
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,232
But, you see, that's the thing.

401
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,008
It was all part of Klaus' plan.

402
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,810
He was sussing
the guy out,

403
00:19:32,811 --> 00:19:34,879
learning his weaknesses,
his strengths,

404
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,991
getting him to let
his guard down.

405
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,350
That's how Klaus
does it.

406
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,886
Then he goes in
for the kill.

407
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:45,089
Because he's
a two-faced sociopath.

408
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,558
There's nothing enviable
about what Klaus does.

409
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,627
He's a monster.

410
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:51,629
We're all
monsters, Cami.

411
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,064
If you're powerful
like Klaus is,

412
00:19:53,065 --> 00:19:55,266
you just don't have
to bother hiding it.

413
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:58,769
Davina was powerful.

414
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:01,471
She wasn't a monster.

415
00:20:37,841 --> 00:20:41,096
It is done.

416
00:20:41,097 --> 00:20:43,814
The power of the original
sister flows through me.

417
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,395
And will that be enough
to make Klaus suffer?

418
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:49,286
I will hurt Klaus Mikaelson
as he hurt me.

419
00:20:49,287 --> 00:20:51,255
When I am done,

420
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:54,857
he will wish
that he could die.

421
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,163
You gonna open
this place today?

422
00:21:06,564 --> 00:21:08,751
And risk you eating
the clientele?

423
00:21:08,752 --> 00:21:10,233
Oh, and here
I thought

424
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,435
you were starting
to like me again.

425
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,906
[Cell phone vibrating]

426
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:20,554
[Beep]

427
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,612
Ah, you've deigned
to break your despair

428
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:23,947
long enough to
pick up the phone.

429
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:25,315
I figured you'd
just keep calling.

430
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,582
Klaus: I'm in
the cauldron now.

431
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:27,918
You could meet me here.

432
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,187
We could start burning
passersby at the stake.

433
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,942
Sorry. I'm gonna
chase down my own lead.

434
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:35,325
And where
might that be,

435
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,026
the bottom of
a bottle of scotch?

436
00:21:37,027 --> 00:21:39,094
I'm at
Sophie Deveraux's place.

437
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:42,032
I figured I'll sit here
and drink till she shows.

438
00:21:42,033 --> 00:21:44,067
Or you could snap
out of this funk

439
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:46,502
and come and
help me end this.

440
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:49,583
[Beep]

441
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:51,974
[Beep]

442
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:57,346
Sophie: Big, bad
Klaus Mikaelson.

443
00:21:59,636 --> 00:22:02,012
Sophie.

444
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:05,287
Just the witch I was
looking to brutalize.

445
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:08,223
Perhaps you could explain
the attacks on my men.

446
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,627
[Beep]

447
00:22:13,997 --> 00:22:16,299
Rebekah is not
answering her calls.

448
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,234
You worried about whoever
killed those daywalkers

449
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:19,769
still being out there?

450
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,870
Frankly, I'm
worried that she

451
00:22:20,871 --> 00:22:22,972
had something
to do with this.

452
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:25,369
She's very displeased
with Niklaus,

453
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,790
perhaps even
conspiring

454
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,848
with others.

455
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:34,983
Thierry, is it?

456
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:38,019
That's right.

457
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,050
My sister
is rather fond of you.

458
00:22:40,051 --> 00:22:43,558
Strange, she's not typically
drawn to unremarkable men.

459
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:48,017
Would you care to explain
your sudden magnetism?

460
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:50,894
I don't know
what you're...

461
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:53,687
You can either
tell me what you know

462
00:22:53,688 --> 00:22:56,732
or I can distribute tiny pieces
of you throughout the quarter.

463
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:59,903
She asked me to keep an
eye out on witch stuff.

464
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:02,044
I found something,
and when I showed her,

465
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:04,046
we were jumped
by some guy.

466
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,815
He desiccated her
with his touch.

467
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:09,985
Like a coward,
you left her.

468
00:23:09,986 --> 00:23:11,353
What was I
supposed to do,

469
00:23:11,354 --> 00:23:13,500
fight some warlock that
took out an original?

470
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:15,825
Where was this,
exactly?

471
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,761
The docks,
warehouse 57.

472
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:20,674
I was just doing
what she asked.

473
00:23:20,675 --> 00:23:22,964
You cannot tell
Klaus about this.

474
00:23:27,348 --> 00:23:30,390
I shall take that
into consideration.

475
00:23:30,391 --> 00:23:31,518
I'm coming with you.

476
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,276
No. Stay here.
Compound is safe.

477
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:36,210
Rebekah is in trouble.
I'm going.

478
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,483
Do not leave my sight.
Understand?

479
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:47,055
Me calling things
off with you

480
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:49,370
wasn't lack
of interest.

481
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:53,461
I was hoping to save you
from all this.

482
00:23:55,264 --> 00:23:59,463
Well, thanks, Romeo,
but I'm in it.

483
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:01,970
So when are you gonna
get to the good part

484
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:04,259
with Klaus
and that Papa guy?

485
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,209
Papa Tunde said he wanted
to empower the witches.

486
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,878
Mostly, he wanted
money and territory.

487
00:24:09,879 --> 00:24:11,980
Klaus and Elijah weren't
about to give him either.

488
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:14,983
He didn't like that,
so he went on a rampage.

489
00:24:14,984 --> 00:24:17,152
No one was safe...

490
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:19,654
[Panting]

491
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,695
Marcel, voice-over:
Not the humans in the faction...

492
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,428
Not the guerrero werewolves.

493
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:35,497
He even went after the witches
who opposed him.

494
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:38,840
Elijah offered a truce...

495
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,675
He gave his word, in fact...

496
00:24:40,676 --> 00:24:45,046
But Klaus, being Klaus,
he had another idea.

497
00:24:45,047 --> 00:24:46,548
You're late, Elijah.

498
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:47,816
It's not like
the noble brother

499
00:24:47,817 --> 00:24:49,050
to keep me waiting.

500
00:24:49,051 --> 00:24:50,819
I'm sorry, mate.

501
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,253
Elijah is
the brother you meet

502
00:24:52,254 --> 00:24:54,622
when negotiations
are to be had.

503
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:58,230
I'm the one you get when
negotiations are closed.

504
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,761
You do not scare me.

505
00:24:59,762 --> 00:25:01,596
You have no idea
the power I possess.

506
00:25:01,597 --> 00:25:03,264
Oh, in fact, I made
it a point to learn

507
00:25:03,265 --> 00:25:05,499
all about
your power.

508
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,968
I noticed how you're
almost always near

509
00:25:06,969 --> 00:25:08,635
those twin sons
of yours,

510
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,005
how they bear your
distinctive mark.

511
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:13,707
Got me to thinking.

512
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,711
You channel their
power, don't you,

513
00:25:16,712 --> 00:25:19,180
which, of course,
begs the question,

514
00:25:19,181 --> 00:25:20,548
what would happen
were that power

515
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:23,384
to be taken away,
if those sons

516
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:25,853
whose lives
you depend on

517
00:25:25,854 --> 00:25:30,924
were suddenly
struck down?

518
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:41,188
What of that power
then?

519
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,578
I will kill you
for this.

520
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:53,869
I cannot be killed.

521
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,120
You, however...

522
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,664
Aagh!

523
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:00,087
That's horrible.

524
00:26:00,088 --> 00:26:02,122
Oh, to Klaus,
it's just business.

525
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:05,226
And don't you think
there's something

526
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,965
fundamentally wrong
with that?

527
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,590
Don't you worry
you'll end up

528
00:26:09,064 --> 00:26:11,698
one of his victims or,
worse, just like him?

529
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,469
Tunde: Poor Marcellus.

00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,858
We've no room for
slackers of cowards

707
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:01,226
in our kingdom.

708
00:39:04,077 --> 00:39:06,578
Now that you've
regained your composure,

709
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,281
let's move on
to the next item

710
00:39:08,282 --> 00:39:10,082
of business,
shall we,

711
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:15,087
with a little help from
our dear friend Sophie.

712
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:17,323
I got no reason
to help you,

713
00:39:17,324 --> 00:39:19,091
and I sure as hell don't have
a reason to help him.

714
00:39:19,092 --> 00:39:21,467
Klaus: Now, now,
don't be difficult, luv.

715
00:39:21,468 --> 00:39:23,729
You'll only live as long
as you're of use to me,

716
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,665
and right now,
your best use is to explain

717
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:28,067
why a witch I killed
100 years ago

718
00:39:28,068 --> 00:39:30,503
has come back
for revenge.

719
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:31,837
Sophie: Come on.

720
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,732
Resurrected witches
with vast power?

721
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:37,276
It's the harvest.

722
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:40,345
4 girls were meant
to die and be reborn.

723
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:41,747
I don't know how,

724
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:43,649
but someone
jacked that power,

725
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:47,153
and they used it
to bring back 4 witches,

726
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:49,245
just not
the right ones.

727
00:39:49,246 --> 00:39:51,622
So there's still
a chance.

728
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:54,360
If we can get that power back,
we can save Davina.

729
00:39:54,361 --> 00:39:55,527
Let's concentrate

730
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:56,862
on the immediate
problem, shall we?

731
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:59,754
Papa Tunde
wants revenge.

732
00:39:59,755 --> 00:40:01,333
He'll continue
to attack us,

733
00:40:01,334 --> 00:40:03,769
channeling power from
the vampires he sacrifices.

734
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,372
He kills, he grows
more dangerous.

735
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:09,599
So how do I end him?

736
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,518
He needs sacrifices
to gain power.

737
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,378
Hmm.

738
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,515
You keep him from killing
any more nightwalkers,

739
00:40:16,516 --> 00:40:17,899
that's a start.

740
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,287
Unless... he finds
the one place

741
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:26,692
with a load of vampires
ready to be sacrificed.

742
00:40:26,693 --> 00:40:29,742
[Music playing]

743
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,754
Is it done?

744
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:03,195
This blade now contains
all the power

745
00:41:03,196 --> 00:41:04,902
I harvested
from the vampires.

746
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,532
It will do things
worse than death,

747
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:09,949
even to an original.

748
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,174
And are you ready
for the final offering?

749
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:19,502
In the name of the witches
of the french quarter,

750
00:41:19,503 --> 00:41:22,503
it is my honor.

751
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:38,262
Thank you, Papa Tunde.

752
00:41:58,535 --> 00:42:03,229
