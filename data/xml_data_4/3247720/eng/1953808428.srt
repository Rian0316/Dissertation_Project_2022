00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:05,269
TED: <i>I can't believe your mom's</i>
<i>not coming to the wedding?</i>

2
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:06,987
Okay, seriously,
I-I need to stop crying

3
00:00:06,989 --> 00:00:09,340
Does anyone know how
to turn this off?

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,891
Is there, like, a button
or something?

5
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,660
Want me to feel
around for it?

6
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:14,294
It's probably
somewhere on your back.

7
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,697
Stop it.
What? I'm trying to cheer you up.

8
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:18,582
I don't think that's possible
at this point.

9
00:00:18,584 --> 00:00:20,250
Challenge accepted!

10
00:00:20,252 --> 00:00:21,585
No, Barney,

11
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,888
I just need to get myself
to stop crying, that's all.

12
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,090
Boogity-boo!

13
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,225
Lily, what the hell?!
It's not the hiccups.

14
00:00:28,227 --> 00:00:29,876
I was just going on a hunch.

15
00:00:29,878 --> 00:00:32,513
(hiccups)
And now I have the hiccups.

16
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:36,612
Original Air Date on November 11, 2013

17
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:41,637

18
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:47,277
Look, guys, just, seriously,
don't worry about me, okay?

19
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,163
Just let me deal
with this on my own.

20
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:51,448
I'm afraid that's
not possible, Robin.

21
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,868
Once I've accepted a challenge,
it cannot be unaccepted.

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,372
I will not rest
until the job is done.

23
00:00:58,374 --> 00:00:59,673
Oh, is that so?

24
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:03,210
Then where are our diapers
and Samosas?

25
00:01:03,212 --> 00:01:04,678
Aha!

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,181
NARRATOR: <i>Diapers and Samosas.</i>
<i>Oh, that's about something</i>

27
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:10,350
<i>that happened six months</i>
<i>earlier in the fall of 2012.</i>

28
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:12,853
BOTH:
Major craving for a mojito.

29
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:14,221
Oh, God, we're back

30
00:01:14,223 --> 00:01:16,807
to your stupid little
private joke again?

31
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:19,526
Are you guys really still doing
this seven years later?

32
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,979
It's so annoying. Just stop it.

33
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:23,313
Private joke again?

34
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:25,482
Are you guys really still
doing this seven years later?

35
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,034
It's so annoying.
Just stop it.

36
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,786
You don't salute a private!

37
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,771
I'll be right back.
All right.

38
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,273
Lily, are you playing
footsie with me?

39
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:34,491
What?

40
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:37,077
Oh, no, no. I was just feeling
around for your shin.

41
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,662
My shin? Why would you...?

42
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:40,247
Ow! Why'd you do that?

43
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,715
To remind you what pain is.

44
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:45,252
You keep it up with all the
cutesy-tootsy stuff with Robin,

45
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:48,622
gonna be a whole lot more
where that came from.

46
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:50,340
Lily, you have nothing
to worry about.

47
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:52,959
I better not.
You and Robin are platonic.

48
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,962
Please.
Ted and Robin are not platonic.

49
00:01:55,964 --> 00:01:58,065
Just like me and Robin
are not platonic.

50
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:01,852
Just like no two single people
in the world are ever platonic.

51
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:04,688
Symposium: two people
are only platonic if

52
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,040
in the next 20 minutes

53
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,212
there is no chance
of them hooking up.

54
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:12,913
Truth is, I only know of one
genuinely platonic relationship.

55
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:13,980
You and me.

56
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:15,082
Don't make me laugh, Lily.

57
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:16,583
You want to hit this
so hard.

58
00:02:16,585 --> 00:02:20,504
Seriously, she's playing
footsies with me as I... Ow!

59
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:24,041
No, I'm talking
about Marshall and Robin.

60
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,044
NARRATOR: <i>Marshall and Robin wouldn't</i>
<i>hook up even if this happened:</i>

61
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:28,679
Marshall, Robin!

62
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,515
If you guys don't full-on
make out in the next 20 minutes,

63
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:34,051
they're gonna blow me up
and everyone in this bar!

64
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,169
My God, no!
Anyone but Robin.

65
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,988
I really don't want
to do this!

66
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,190
Guys, we have no time!
Just do it!

67
00:02:48,149 --> 00:02:51,034
I'm sorry, baby,
I just, I can't do it.

68
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:51,785
Aw...

69
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:52,903
(explosion)

70
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,372
And the only survivor
was me

71
00:02:55,374 --> 00:02:57,691
because I was upstairs
banging Ted's mom.

72
00:02:57,693 --> 00:03:00,193
What? Get that blond girl's
phone number?

73
00:03:00,195 --> 00:03:01,578
Challenge accepted.

74
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,131
(phone rings)

75
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:07,501
Unknown caller, stop calling me.

76
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:08,535
Are you gonna answer it?

77
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:09,670
Yeah, 'cause it's 1994

78
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:11,088
and I'm gonna pick up a phone

79
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,589
without knowing who's on
the other end.

80
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,758
I should get going.

81
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,976
Ted...

82
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,644
Lily, by every definition
of the word platonic,

83
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:19,546
including Barney's fake one,
I can say

84
00:03:19,548 --> 00:03:20,981
with total certainty...

85
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,266
that Brussels sprouts

86
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:24,217
are the comeback vegetable
of the 21st century.

87
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:25,385
Well, see you guys later.

88
00:03:25,387 --> 00:03:27,187
Bye.

89
00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:30,691
Challenge completed.

90
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:33,443
I'm sorry. I-I missed
the first half of this.

91
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:34,695
Um, why is picking up

92
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,781
a drunk chick sitting alone
and rubbing a tan line

93
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:40,918
on her finger where a wedding
ring used to be, a challenge?

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,804
Because I said
challenge accepted.

95
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,789
See? That's your problem,
Barney.

96
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,792
You only accept challenges
you came up with.

97
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,595
Just once,
I'd like to see you accept

98
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:52,963
someone else's challenge.

99
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:55,482
Challenge acc...
Wait-- what's the challenge?

100
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:59,353
Interesting. An opportunity rife
with possibilities.

101
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,687
We need to find something

102
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,439
with just the right amount
of poetic...

103
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:05,692
Get a girl's number
while talking like a dolphin!

104
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,594
That works.

105
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:15,035
(chittering like a dolphin)

106
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:23,443
Open your eyes, ref!
That's not a pregnant lady!

107
00:04:23,445 --> 00:04:25,462
It's a basketball
under his shirt!

108
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:27,297
Blow the freakin'
whistle!

109
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,917
Anyways, Barney's right;

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,952
I would absolutely
let the bar blow up.

111
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:34,755
But you'd die, and
Lily would die, too.

112
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:37,257
Yeah, but then we could
haunt the bar for eternity

113
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,309
like we always planned.
Anyways, Robin's your girl.

114
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:41,178
Why do we keep
coming back to this?

115
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,397
It's fun. Tickets are cheap.
Gets us out of the house.

116
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,898
No, me and Robin.

117
00:04:46,684 --> 00:04:49,820
Because Robin told me that
she's still in love with you.

118
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:56,461
Are you serious?
Robin told you that she's

119
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,794
still in love with me?

120
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,327
No, I just made that up.

121
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:01,379
But it was worth it
because I can tell

122
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:04,365
by that look on your face
that you still have feelings for Robin.

123
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,968
Okay, ball is sitting
on the basket!

124
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:10,156
That's not only illegal,
it's unsafe!

125
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:12,442
Come on, Gens, D up!

126
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,595
It's this monastery
in Connecticut out in the woods,

127
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,715
and the nuns there,
they make this gourmet cheese.

128
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,049
It's just amazing.

129
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:21,718
(chittering)

130
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,003
Wow, was that
three glasses of wine?

131
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:25,438
Where does the time go

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,524
(chitters)

133
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,526
(chuckles) Look, I know
that you need

134
00:05:29,528 --> 00:05:31,010
to get back
to your studies.

135
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:33,613
Maybe we could get together
some other time?

136
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:36,332
(clicking, chittering)

137
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:37,450
No! Not possible!

138
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,235
It was the performance
of a lifetime.

139
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,500
Man, if I'd have hung around
for a few more minutes,

140
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:41,059
I probably could have

141
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,227
gotten her to touch my blowhole.
Give me that.

142
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,242
(distant phone rings)

143
00:05:46,244 --> 00:05:47,911
Hello?

144
00:05:47,913 --> 00:05:49,862
Hi, did you just give
your phone number to a guy

145
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:50,997
who was squeaking
like a dolphin?

146
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:53,166
(chuckles)
Yeah.

147
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:54,250
Honey, listen to me.

148
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,503
I need you to take
a year, a full year

149
00:05:56,505 --> 00:05:57,971
and just be
celibate, okay?

150
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:59,138
No boys.

151
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,557
One year.

152
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,475
I think you know
I'm right about this.

153
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,927
You're right.

154
00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:05,228
Yeah.

155
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,646
That was heartbreaking

156
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:09,215
And pants-breaking
Boing-oing-oing!

157
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:10,767
All right, next challenge.

158
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:12,819
Oh, this is an all-night thing?

159
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:17,023
Okay, um, pick up a girl...

160
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,575
wearing a garbage bag.

161
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:22,078
(scoffs)
I'd be <i>"Glad"</i> to.

162
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,998
Just hope she's not too <i>"Hefty""</i>

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,285
And those are all of the brands
of trash bags I can think of.

164
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:30,370
I'm not done.

165
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:34,757
You also can't use
the letter "E."

166
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:41,431
Challng... accptd-d.

167
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,551
You're single,
she's single,

168
00:06:44,553 --> 00:06:45,852
It's time to do this.

169
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,804
You're only saying this
because you bet Lily

170
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:49,755
that Robin and I would
end up together,

171
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:51,257
and you want
that five bucks.

172
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:52,859
I need that five bucks, Ted.

173
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,612
But more importantly,
I need you to be happy.

174
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,697
Marshall, we're platonic.

175
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,115
But you're not platonic!

176
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:01,784
You are 20 short minutes away
from happily ever after.

177
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:04,370
I mean, if you left
right now.

178
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:09,459
Hey.

179
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,411
I have loved you from
the moment we met.

180
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,778
I know we're meant
to be together.

181
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,247
I don't want to waste
another second without you.

182
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,331
Let's give it
another shot.

183
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,949
Okay!

184
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,951
No!
(buzzer sounds)

185
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:21,087
Pay up, baby.
Pay up.

186
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,788
TED:
Oh, yes!

187
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,125
♪ Sweet, sweet five bucks,
you soon will be mine ♪

188
00:07:26,127 --> 00:07:28,595
♪ Even though Lily
and I share bank accounts ♪

189
00:07:28,597 --> 00:07:31,431
♪ You're already mine
to begin with. ♪ Sorry.

190
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:35,251
And you and Robin get a lifetime
of happiness, so there's that.

191
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,402
But you better hurry up

192
00:07:36,404 --> 00:07:37,803
before some other guy
snatches her up.

193
00:07:37,805 --> 00:07:39,822
Really? And who's
my competition?

194
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:44,827
Okay, don't use the letter "E."
Don't use the letter "E."

195
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Hey.

196
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:49,115
Damn it.

197
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:52,669
Hi. I... am...

198
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,537
Barney. Damn it!

199
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,939
There's an E
in my name!

200
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:59,926
Hi. My word for...

201
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:03,546
this guy is Barno.

202
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:09,719
Barno. You look...

203
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:11,471
not ugly.

204
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:12,388
(chuckles)

205
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,724
Your... dial thing...

206
00:08:14,726 --> 00:08:15,725
is what?

207
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,528
Do you want
to just go back to my place?

208
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,480
Yes. Damn it!

209
00:08:21,398 --> 00:08:23,900
I want to buy you a drink.

210
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:28,404
But first, what do I call you?

211
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:30,039
Elaine Edelstein.

212
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:35,912
How about I just call you...

213
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,213
tomorrow?

214
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:40,800
Your digits, m'lady?

215
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,252
Seriously, guys,

216
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,254
you're gonna have
to try harder than that.

217
00:08:45,256 --> 00:08:47,507
Challenge accepted.

218
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,042
Excuse me, hi.

219
00:08:50,044 --> 00:08:52,478
I'm Ryan Gosling's
personal assistant.

220
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,764
He saw you
as you were walking in,

221
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:58,101
and he sent me over
to tell you to wait here.

222
00:08:58,103 --> 00:08:59,602
Be cool. This is real, okay?

223
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:03,106
But listen, Ryan is super shy.

224
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:05,324
Aw...
I know.

225
00:09:05,326 --> 00:09:08,227
Which means that if he comes in
here and he sees you talking

226
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,197
to some other guy, he's gonna
turn right around and leave.

227
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,700
Nod if you understand.

228
00:09:14,451 --> 00:09:15,618
Redhead at the bar.

229
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,036
Challenge accepted.

230
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:20,690
Hey, there.
Get away from me!

231
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:23,075
It's like you're trying
to lose, Eddie!

232
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,460
Hey, Eddie,
last time I saw

233
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:26,462
this many turnovers
was at a bakery. - Oh!

234
00:09:27,514 --> 00:09:29,215
So are you doing this or what?
No.

235
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:31,350
And for the record,
if I were gonna do it,

236
00:09:31,352 --> 00:09:34,437
I wouldn't just be, like,
"Hey, we should get back together".

237
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:35,605
Amateur hour.

238
00:09:35,607 --> 00:09:37,640
Here's how you do it.

239
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,445
Excuse me. Okay, sorry.

240
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,814
(text alert sounds)
Sorry.

241
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:46,883
Huh.

242
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,739
Stop, thief!

243
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:58,578
MARSHALL: <i>The blue French horn,</i>
<i>it's so romantic!</i>

244
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,863
Oh, my God, do you know
who you are?!

245
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,715
You're Nicholas Sparks!

246
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:05,785
Hey, everybody, we got
a, uh, celebrity

247
00:10:05,787 --> 00:10:08,805
in the crowd over here.
We got, uh, Nicholas Sparks!

248
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:10,473
You didn't let me finish.

249
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,558
Ted, listen...

250
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,743
(buzzer sounds)

251
00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:15,728
I can do without reliving that.

252
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,930
Are you completely blind?

253
00:10:17,932 --> 00:10:18,731
What?

254
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,483
Open your eyes, ref!

255
00:10:20,485 --> 00:10:23,152
The ball hasn't touched
the ground in seven minutes!

256
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:24,687
Hey, ref, check
your voicemail!

257
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:26,689
I think you've missed
a few calls!

258
00:10:26,691 --> 00:10:28,691
(scoffs)

259
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:32,144
Are you completely blind?!

260
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,279
Wait-- me or...?

261
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:34,831
You, Ted!

262
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,199
Robin has changed her mind.

263
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:38,034
No, Robin doesn't change
her mind.

264
00:10:38,036 --> 00:10:39,452
Except that she does.

265
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:42,288
Remember how she used to claim
to hate white guy funk bands?

266
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,373
And yet, at the farewell
performance of my band,

267
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,126
"The Funk, the Whole Funk
and Nothing but the Funk,"

268
00:10:47,128 --> 00:10:49,095
there's Robin
rhythmically nodding her head

269
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:51,681
and shouting out a request
for "Give Up the Funk."

270
00:10:51,683 --> 00:10:54,834
I think she was nodding her head
in response to my question,

271
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:57,169
"Do you want
to leave soon?"

272
00:10:57,171 --> 00:10:58,805
And she was
legitimately suggesting

273
00:10:58,807 --> 00:11:00,439
that you give up the funk.

274
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:04,009
Can we just drop this?
I have moved on.

275
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:05,561
Well, except that you haven't.

276
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:08,064
You didn't just come up with
this blue French horn thing.

277
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,398
You've thought about this.

278
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,700
EDDIE:
Mr. Sparks?

279
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,235
I loved <i>The Notebook.</i>

280
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:15,104
Eddie, you're down by 80.

281
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,156
Will you watch the ge?

282
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,243
Do not come any closer!

283
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:21,410
I swear to God I will kill you.

284
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,130
It's cool.
I'm not gonna come any closer.

285
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,883
You're looking at the door,
you're waiting for someone.

286
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:29,168
Someone important,
someone who will fill

287
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,903
an empty space in your life.

288
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:33,089
A movie star?

289
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,340
Ah-huh.

290
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,709
But which one?

291
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,311
Clooney,

292
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:41,731
DiCaprio, Zabka...?

293
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:43,583
No...

294
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,102
I'm gonna go with Ryan...

295
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:48,671
Reyn...

296
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:49,939
Phil-Phillip...

297
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,642
Seacr... Gosling...

298
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:54,410
Ryan Gosling!

299
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:55,995
Yes, I'm waiting
for Ryan Gosling, okay?

300
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,164
Now, leave me alone.

301
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,788
You passed my test, girl.

302
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:10,626
Ryan?
ROBIN: <i>No.</i>

303
00:12:10,628 --> 00:12:12,962
Just... no.

304
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:14,263
I told her I'm a method actor.

305
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:15,915
And I had to get plastic surgery

306
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,884
for an upcoming role
where I play a man

307
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,752
much more handsome than myself.

308
00:12:19,754 --> 00:12:22,021
Congratulations, you win.

309
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:23,422
Win? No, I don't want to win.

310
00:12:23,424 --> 00:12:25,808
I want to keep playing.
More challenges.

311
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,059
Fine, you want
another challenge?

312
00:12:27,061 --> 00:12:29,195
More challenges,
more challenges.

313
00:12:29,197 --> 00:12:30,279
Fine, here's your challenge.

314
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:32,932
Go down to the pharmacy
and buy some diapers.

315
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,985
And, uh, get me a Samosa
from the Indian place.

316
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,987
Sounds like an errand.

317
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,072
While picking up a girl.

318
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:42,658
Challenge accepted!

319
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,826
Come on!

320
00:12:43,828 --> 00:12:44,844
Whatever happened to the guy

321
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:45,878
who wasn't afraid to charge

322
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,296
headlong into the unknown?

323
00:12:47,298 --> 00:12:48,965
What unknown?

324
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,115
Sure, eight years ago

325
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:51,667
when I stole
that blue French horn, yeah.

326
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:53,118
That was the unknown.

327
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,338
But now? I mean, how many times
have we been here?

328
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,423
I know exactly
what's gonna happen.

329
00:12:57,425 --> 00:13:00,125
You know who else knew exactly
what was gonna happen, Ted?

330
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:03,062
The Washington Generals
on January 5, 1971.

331
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:05,514
They knew they were gonna lose,
but they went in there anyway,

332
00:13:05,516 --> 00:13:07,016
and then gave it
their best shot.

333
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,801
And they won that game, Ted!

334
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:10,770
For one reason
and for one reason only.

335
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,305
A scoring error and the fact
that Curly Neal had the flu?

336
00:13:13,307 --> 00:13:15,324
Perseverance.

337
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,410
It was the only win
in Generals history,

338
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,111
but that's all <i>you</i> need.

339
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:20,496
Just one win.

340
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:21,497
(cell phone ringing)

341
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:24,834
I'm gonna go
grab us some beers.

342
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:26,836
(clicks tongue)

343
00:13:26,838 --> 00:13:29,655
Hi, I don't know who this is
or what you're trying to sell,

344
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:32,324
but you are disturbing me
during the Globetrotters.

345
00:13:32,326 --> 00:13:36,295
Hello, Ted,
it's Hammond Druthers.

346
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,767
Target acquired.

347
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:56,159
I'm recruiting volunteers

348
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,910
for the starving puppy orphanage
where I work.

349
00:13:57,912 --> 00:13:59,244
For free.

350
00:13:59,246 --> 00:14:03,015
So, if you wouldn't mind just
writing your number down

351
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:05,801
on this signup sheet...?

352
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:09,355
Listen, I appreciate
that you feel

353
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,756
like you need my number.

354
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:11,924
Um.

355
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:14,110
Maybe it's because
you're really sad

356
00:14:14,112 --> 00:14:15,811
about something
and this is your way

357
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,480
of feeling better
about yourself.

358
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,764
But...

359
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:21,384
since I have a boyfriend,
and I'm pretty sure

360
00:14:21,386 --> 00:14:24,153
I heard you call me a target
earlier over there,

361
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,621
Wha...?
I'm gonna go ahead

362
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:26,822
and not give you my number.

363
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,091
I'm gonna give you
something even better.

364
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:30,776
Wow, right to the chase.

365
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,128
Meet you in aisle six.

366
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,997
I'm gonna give you this.
Okay.

367
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,749
It's gonna be okay.

368
00:14:37,801 --> 00:14:39,001
You're a good guy.

369
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,286
You will get through this.

370
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:45,841
Uh, okay.

371
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,626
Weirdo alert.

372
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:49,061
(chuckles)

373
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:51,463
(scoffs)

374
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:53,632
Have you met...?

375
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,084
(groans)

376
00:14:55,086 --> 00:14:56,519
Excuse me.

377
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,607
What do you mean "sad"?

378
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,075
HAMMOND DRUTHERS:
<i>Ted?</i>

379
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,944
I'm calling you
from Chicago, Illinois

380
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,529
where I'm a key player

381
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,031
in a very successful
architectural firm.

382
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,315
Oh, yeah, I read about that.

383
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,650
All right,
about what you read...

384
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:13,619
You built
that big concave glass tower.

385
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,788
And it melted a few buildings
across the street.

386
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,873
Yes, fine, but come on.

387
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,259
What architect has made
a major design flaw

388
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,345
that raised the temperature
of the city aquarium

389
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:23,379
to 190 degrees

390
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,664
and killed thousands
of very rare fish?

391
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,667
That's the past, Ted.
I'm looking forward.

392
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,770
I want you on my team.

393
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,805
And I won't take no
for an answer.

394
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,674
No.
I don't think you heard me, Ted.

395
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,943
No.
Come on, Ted!

396
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:39,228
Please?

397
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,564
They're gonna give me
a parking spot if you say yes.

398
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,816
Do I get a parking spot?
Well, we can go tandem.

399
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,350
No.
Every other week then?

400
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:45,902
No.

401
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,927
You know, Chicago's
more of a walking town.

402
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,705
No.
All right!

403
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:51,707
You can have the parking spot.

404
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:52,792
So, that's a yes?

405
00:15:52,794 --> 00:15:54,960
Mm, no.
Look, Ted.

406
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:58,414
I can make your life
very difficult.

407
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,167
How?
How?!

408
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:05,337
I will call you a lot.

409
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,390
I will Tweet at you like crazy.

410
00:16:07,392 --> 00:16:10,893
I will live
on your Facebook wall!

411
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:11,927
We're not Facebook friends.

412
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,312
Yeah, what's going on with that?

413
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:16,065
It's been pending, like,
for eight months now.

414
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,818
Look, Ted, you're a...

415
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,520
a very hot commodity.

416
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,191
Everybody loves the GNB Tower.

417
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,109
And how it hasn't blinded
any pilots

418
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,228
on final approach into O'Hare.

419
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,112
(laughs)

420
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,697
And I-I may have told

421
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,365
the partners here
that you and I are

422
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,583
very, very good friends.

423
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:37,169
So, please, just say
that you'll think about it.

424
00:16:37,171 --> 00:16:38,370
Fine.

425
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,256
I'll think about it.

426
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:42,541
Druthers shoots, he scores!

427
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,411
Sad? Lady, I got 14 girls'
numbers in the last hour.

428
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:48,597
And this was an off night.
(chuckles)

429
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,883
What can I possibly
be sad about?

430
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,602
I think you were in love
and you messed it up.

431
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,605
And every moment of your life
since then

432
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:59,759
has been spent trying to stay
busy enough to ignore that fact.

433
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:02,728
NARRATOR: <i>And that's how Barney met</i>
<i>your mother.</i>

434
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,566
Well, the Generals lost.

435
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,984
What a nail biter--
the whole fourth quarter

436
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,453
my heart was in my throat.

437
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:11,620
What was the final?

438
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:12,822
216 to 12.

439
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,544
Nobody talk to me right
now, I can't even...

440
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,244
The strangest thing
happened at the game.

441
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,212
I got a phone call
from an unknown number.

442
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:21,997
And when I answered I...

443
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,833
You're eating olives.

444
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,301
Yup.

445
00:17:25,303 --> 00:17:26,302
Do you want these?

446
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,786
I hate olives.

447
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,421
I... thought you hate olives.

448
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:32,057
(laughs)
I guess I changed my mind.

449
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:34,260
(phone ringing)

450
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,394
Ah!

451
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:36,896
Hello, partner!

452
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,815
Boy, that just sounds right,
doesn't it?

453
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,234
Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers.

454
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:43,969
My answer is no.

455
00:17:43,971 --> 00:17:46,822
What? No, Ted, come on!

456
00:17:46,824 --> 00:17:50,576
I'm sorry, I still have things
to do here in New York.

457
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:52,644
I am going to build
a tower of glass

458
00:17:52,646 --> 00:17:54,914
and melt you with it!

459
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:57,649
No, you won't.
No, I won't, but know this.

460
00:17:57,651 --> 00:17:59,168
After today

461
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,753
this offer

462
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,037
is gone forever.

463
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,957
When I hang up this phone,
you and I are done.

464
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,826
The door is closed!
Okay.

465
00:18:07,828 --> 00:18:08,961
The door's always open, Ted.

466
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,495
If you change your mind,
just call me back, okay?

467
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:12,548
Bye.

468
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,834
I think he's coming around.

469
00:18:15,836 --> 00:18:17,436
We tried dating a while back

470
00:18:17,438 --> 00:18:19,538
and it was a disaster.

471
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,974
But I-I always regret giving up.

472
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:24,226
It just ended so quickly.

473
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,311
(quiet laugh)

474
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,580
What about you?

475
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:29,949
You and your boyfriend
gonna go the distance?

476
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:31,516
I don't know.

477
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:34,703
I think maybe I still
haven't met the right guy.

478
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,855
Hmm.

479
00:18:36,857 --> 00:18:39,325
I wonder if I know someone
to set you up with.

480
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,331
Drawing a blank.

481
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,032
Are you gonna
go get this girl?

482
00:18:47,034 --> 00:18:48,083
Or what?

483
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,368
I don't know.

484
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,337
I'm kind of
at my peak right now.

485
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,206
I don't know if I can
just walk away from the game.

486
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:58,060
Do you want to keep playing
or do you want to win?

487
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:02,881
I want to win.

488
00:19:03,716 --> 00:19:05,884
What am I doing?

489
00:19:05,886 --> 00:19:08,020
In less than 20 minutes,
Robin and I could be...

490
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,238
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

491
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,773
It's gonna take a lot more
than 20 minutes.

492
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,892
This is gonna take everything
you have got.

493
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:16,445
This is gonna take all of your
time, all of your attention.

495
