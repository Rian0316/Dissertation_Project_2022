1
00:00:00,047 --> 00:00:01,961
Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,301 --> 00:00:04,027
Wisteria Lane's new hero...

3
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:04,896
Hello?

4
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,552
Superhero houses are great!

5
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,997
Turned out to be anything but.

6
00:00:10,654 --> 00:00:12,294
Orson's mother took
up residence...

7
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:15,172
I've decided to accept
your wife's kind invitation.

8
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:15,896
You wouldn't.

9
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:17,490
And Mike couldn't remember...

10
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:19,085
No memory, huh?
That'sconvenient.

11
00:00:19,164 --> 00:00:20,222
Anything at all.

12
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:21,322
Here's our search warrant.

13
00:00:21,624 --> 00:00:22,894
We couldn't
find a toolbox.

14
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:25,996
You might want to
wash that wrench off.

15
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:27,460
It's got something on it.

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,787
I'm just saying that we never
spend the night at your house.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,894
But your place is
so warm and cozy.

18
00:00:36,093 --> 00:00:37,547
Oh, it's also
a disaster area.

19
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:39,316
I didn't get a chance
to clean it today.

20
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:39,742
Oops!

21
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,777
Oh, here, let me.

22
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,930
Susan Mayer had never
thought of herself as Cinderella,

23
00:00:47,593 --> 00:00:49,338
but then one day...

24
00:00:50,345 --> 00:00:51,806
a prince showed up.

25
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:57,201
Well, we can't have you
sleeping in squalor, can we?

26
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,046
My place it is.

27
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:05,227
And Susan realized
her life had become...

28
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:06,844
a fairy tale.

29
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,883
And since her prince had
welcomed her into his castle,

30
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:16,729
She felt the least she
could do was thank him...

31
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:18,239
Again...

32
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:19,926
And again...

33
00:01:20,863 --> 00:01:22,055
And again.

34
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:27,414
The next morning, however,
Susan discovered castles...

35
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,746
Don't run themselves.

36
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,138
All right, oh...

37
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:41,786
But let's make it a quickie
'cause you are wasting water.

38
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:45,369
Sorry.

39
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:47,236
I didn't mean
to startle you.

40
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:49,544
Who are you?

41
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:50,981
I am Rupert.

42
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:52,417
I work for Mr. Hainsworth.

43
00:01:53,107 --> 00:01:54,863
That would be the
man you slept with,

44
00:01:55,093 --> 00:01:57,028
in case names
weren't exchanged.

45
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:58,703
Oh, no,

46
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:00,422
I'm your boss' girlfriend.

47
00:02:00,423 --> 00:02:01,898
Surely he mentioned me.

48
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:04,035
Mm, not that I recollect.

49
00:02:05,464 --> 00:02:06,168
Rupert.

50
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:07,967
Good morning...

51
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:08,912
boss.

52
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:10,523
I thought you
were off today.

53
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,131
Isn't... Isn't your
sister in town?

54
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,995
Uh, that's next
weekend, sir.

55
00:02:15,596 --> 00:02:16,710
It's a good thing, too.

56
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,596
Otherwise, I might not have had
the pleasure of meeting your...

57
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:21,243
girlfriend.

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,386
Susan?

59
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,631
Yes, we met at the,
um, at the hospital.

60
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:29,977
Why don't I fetch
you a robe?

61
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:31,730
Loving that idea.

62
00:02:39,484 --> 00:02:40,891
Would you care
for some breakfast?

63
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,886
Omelette?
Strawberry tart? Brioche?

64
00:02:45,268 --> 00:02:47,262
Um, yeah,
that sounds great.

65
00:02:48,008 --> 00:02:48,887
You pick.

66
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,670
Yes, Susan's life had indeed
become a fairy tale.

67
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:56,398
You are aware there
is a Mrs. Hainsworth?

68
00:02:57,605 --> 00:02:58,582
Well, of course.

69
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,093
And what's a fairy tale...

70
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:03,013
Tart it is.

71
00:03:05,294 --> 00:03:07,268
Without a dragon to slay?

74
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,689
We know dangerous men
walk among us.

75
00:03:54,206 --> 00:03:55,918
What we can't be sure of

76
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:58,535
is who they are
or where they hide.

77
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:01,599
So the most we can
offer any stranger

78
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:03,140
is reasonable doubt.

79
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:05,423
But once the doubt is gone,

80
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:08,285
people are anything
but reasonable.

81
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:11,957
I am telling you, our
neighbor is a pedophile,

82
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,142
and I expect you
to do something about it.

83
00:04:14,252 --> 00:04:16,589
Mrs. Scavo, he's not listed
on any sex offender registry.

84
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,949
He's never had so much
as a traffic ticket.

85
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,713
He's a single man with
a basement full of toys!

86
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:25,884
I understand your concern, but we
can't book a guy on possession of toys.

87
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:26,668
You don't get it.

88
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,769
His house had
this creepy vibe.

89
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:30,848
Tell him, Tom.

90
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:32,525
I never went down
to the actual room...

91
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,684
Okay, he wasn't there.
He doesn't know.

92
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:39,003
Look, he had a wall full of pictures
of half-naked boys in swimsuits.

93
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,391
Didn't you say
he was a swim coach?

94
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:43,040
What are you, his lawyer?

95
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,855
You have to admit, it's odd.

96
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:45,723
Here's what's odd...

97
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,899
If your neighbor
had something to hide,

98
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:50,135
why'd he invite you in
to see all of his stuff?

99
00:04:57,403 --> 00:05:00,705
He wasn't technically home
when I went inside.

100
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,187
So you broke in?

101
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:05,179
The door was open...

102
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,405
I was bringing
him a cake.

103
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:10,144
A cake?

104
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,869
It was a "thank you" cake.

105
00:05:12,768 --> 00:05:14,410
He sort of saved my life.

106
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,235
She didn't know thate was a pedophile
when she baked the actual cake.

107
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,745
He doesn't care
about the cake, Tom.

108
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,150
-Why are you snapping at me?
-I'm not snapping at you.

109
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:23,843
-You're totally snapping.
-I am snapping

110
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:26,550
because there is
a monster across the street,

111
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:30,072
and Barney Fife here is making
me sound like the bad guy!

112
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,192
Look, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:34,446 --> 00:05:36,693
She's been under a lot
of stress, hasn't slept well.

114
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:38,957
You better not be
apologizing for me!

115
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,955
Gotta go.

116
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:49,107
So, I've got some
fabulous news.

117
00:05:49,546 --> 00:05:51,754
Well, I hope it's more
fabulous than this dress.

118
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,122
I look something
Ike Turner would hit.

119
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:57,258
You're gonna have to find yourself
another personal shopper.

120
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,622
What, I slam one dress,
and you quit on me?

121
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,940
No, that's my news.

122
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:05,057
I'm leaving the store and
starting my own business.

123
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,753
"Beauty by Vern"?

124
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:11,227
You're opening up a salon?
God, could you get any gayer?

125
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,953
It's a consulting firm for
beauty pageant contestants.

126
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,432
And the answer's "yes."

127
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:19,819
This week, I'm coaching little girls
for the Miss Snowflake pageant.

128
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:23,132
It's very rewarding.
Hey, you know what might be fun?

129
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,917
If you come down
and give a talk.

130
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,329
You know, give the
kids some pointers.

131
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,055
Vern, I worked the catwalks
in Milan and Paris.

132
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:32,045
I'm not gonna give makeup tips
to little miss training bra.

133
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,148
You have been
in rare bitch form.

134
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:36,597
It's been months now,
so don't blame it on your cycle.

135
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:39,866
Don't call me a bitch,
and stop tracking my cycle.

136
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,343
I told you that freaks me out.

137
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,102
I'm just saying you've
been very cranky today.

138
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,010
What's going on?

139
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,047
The divorce decree
came through today.

140
00:06:51,416 --> 00:06:53,605
Carlos is officially
out of my life.

141
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:55,246
Oh, honey.

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,964
The girls' ages
range 8 to 12.

143
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,089
We meet every Thursday in
the rec room of the elks lodge.

144
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:03,335
I'm not doing it.

145
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:05,254
You need a project.

146
00:07:05,255 --> 00:07:06,621
That's your problem,
you're bored.

147
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,470
And you know what
the cure for that is...

148
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,414
Helping others.

149
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,733
Fine. I'll do it,

150
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:15,947
But I want
this dress for free.

151
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,567
Evil! You said
you hated it.

152
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,273
And I hate helping
others, too,

153
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,524
but I'm doing that,
aren't I?

154
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,175
Is the coast clear?

155
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,018
I don't wanna
flash the help again.

156
00:07:30,105 --> 00:07:31,786
Relax.
He's making breakfast,

157
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,985
But you're more than
welcome to flash me.

158
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,917
How long has Rupert
worked for you?

159
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,785
Oh, for years.
He's practically family.

160
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,363
So you're that close, and
you never told him about me?

161
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,471
Yes, about that...

162
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,809
Rupert was incredibly
devoted to Jane.

163
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,347
He's, uh, never seen me
with another woman,

164
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,059
Let alone a frisky,
naked one.

165
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:59,079
Well, that explains why he was
a little cold to me this morning.

166
00:07:59,629 --> 00:08:01,626
Was he?
I'll have a talk with him.

167
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,900
Oh, no, don't do that.
That'll just make it wor.

168
00:08:04,037 --> 00:08:04,707
I get it.

169
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,258
He loved Jane.
He doesn't know me.

170
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,460
You know, I'll just
have to charm him,

171
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,148
warm him up a little.

172
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,806
Well, I'm, uh,
I'm sure you'll find a way.

173
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:21,499
Great.
9:00 in the morning,

174
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,771
and I have to put on
a slinky, black cocktail dress.

175
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:27,846
Hey, here's an idea.

176
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,581
You keep some things
in a drawer at my house.

177
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:32,607
Would it be okay
if I had one here?

178
00:08:33,314 --> 00:08:33,978
A drawer?

179
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:36,050
Do you think we'll
be here that often?

180
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,070
Your shower
s six power nozzles.

181
00:08:39,422 --> 00:08:41,063
With or without you,
I'll be back.

182
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,935
Well, then by all means,
let's get you a drawer.

183
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,296
I don't need much.
One of those will do.

184
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,821
Actually,
that's not a good idea.

185
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,893
Rupert arranges
things meticulously.

186
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:54,049
You'll never win him over
if you mess with his system.

187
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,805
Rupert?

188
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:58,570
Wow! Your timing's perfect.

189
00:08:59,936 --> 00:09:01,011
Not always.

190
00:09:01,473 --> 00:09:03,290
Susan will be
needing a drawer.

191
00:09:04,154 --> 00:09:05,131
A drawer, sir?

192
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:07,042
Yes, for her things.

193
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,955
She's gonna be spending
more time here.

194
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:11,608
Yeah, Rupe, I hope
we can be good friends,

195
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:13,699
'cause you're gonna be
seeing lots more of me.

196
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,785
Oh, madam, that
hardly seems possible.

197
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:22,485
Mother Hodge,
your food will get cold!

198
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:28,662
Why, please, is there a lock
on the liquor cabinet?

199
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:32,144
Because your doctor says people taking
your medication shouldn't drink.

200
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:34,340
A warning you've chosen
to ignore if the...

201
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:37,222
lipstick on the vodka
bottle is any indication.

202
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:41,125
Poached fish again?

203
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:42,648
I don't want this.

204
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,018
I want what
you're all having.

205
00:09:45,105 --> 00:09:47,705
Well, your doctor has you
on a low fat, low sodium diet.

206
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,019
Eight meals this week,

207
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:51,071
Eight times I've told
you the same thing.

208
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:54,451
So, who would
like to say grace?

209
00:09:54,546 --> 00:09:55,448
Allow me.

210
00:09:58,535 --> 00:09:59,334
Dear Lord,

211
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:02,048
I thank you for this bland,
indifferently prepared meal,

212
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,469
and beseech you to ignite
some spark of compassion

213
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,355
in my coldhearted
daughter-in-law.

214
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,907
That she might show
some shred of mercy to me,

215
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:10,891
her wretched captive.

216
00:10:11,207 --> 00:10:12,407
Amen.

217
00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:20,951
Mother, may I remind you,
you asked to come here?

218
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:23,639
I didn't know I'd be trading
one jail for another.

219
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,414
At least at the home

220
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:28,370
you could bribe the orderlies
to smuggle things in,

221
00:10:28,371 --> 00:10:31,188
But here, nothing gets
past the commandant.

222
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,443
I have done
everything I can

223
00:10:34,444 --> 00:10:36,579
to make you happy
and comfortable.

224
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,415
What do you want from us?

225
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:39,811
I want my freedom.

226
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:43,361
I want out of this
perky little gulag

227
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:45,809
and into a house
I can call my own.

228
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,051
And you're going
to buy it for me.

229
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,951
I can't afford
to buy you a house.

230
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,667
You can't afford not to.

231
00:10:58,204 --> 00:11:00,495
I know a house won't
be easy to swing,

232
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:03,597
but how many more of these Edward
Albee dinners do you want to sit through?

233
00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:06,372
What did she mean by,
"you can't afford not to"?

234
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,936
Was she threatening
you with something?

235
00:11:07,937 --> 00:11:11,069
Yes, she's threatening to
make us miserable till we cave.

236
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:14,375
Look, at least see if Edie
has any cheap listings.

237
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,364
We'll be happier,
my mother will be happier...

238
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:17,966
Yeah, and she'll take
terrible care of herself

239
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,205
and be dead in a year.

240
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,775
You just stole my
next argument.

241
00:11:26,373 --> 00:11:29,007
Okay, you've got enough
money to pay either

242
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,556
the phone or the cable
bill, but not both.

243
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,135
Hello? Mike.

244
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:38,918
I'm trying to
help you here.

245
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:43,404
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just do whatever you want.

246
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:47,318
Fine. Cable it is.

247
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,427
Nobody calls you anyway.

248
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,098
What do you want?

249
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:02,687
My toilet's clogged.

250
00:12:02,911 --> 00:12:04,259
I thought maybe
you could fix it.

251
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:06,718
Oh, wait, you can't,
can you?

252
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:08,438
'Cause you don't
have any tools.

253
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:10,881
Must be tough being
a plumber without tools.

254
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,840
Why don't you people
leave me the hell alone?

255
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:15,123
Jeez,

256
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:18,816
you sure are hostile for a guy who
makes his living in the service industry.

257
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,278
You know, it just occurred to me,
there's no point in paying the cable bill

258
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,963
If you're not gonna
have electricity,

259
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:44,146
So I'm thinking pay the
electricity upfront and...

260
00:12:59,357 --> 00:13:01,368
Where have you been?
They're all waiting for you.

261
00:13:01,428 --> 00:13:03,697
I'm here to teach fashion,
so I'm fashionably late.

262
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,035
Cute.

263
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:07,225
Now remember, these mothers have refinanced
their trailers In order to pay for this,

264
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:09,556
so when you make your entrance,
for God sakes, sparkle.

265
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,433
Now in addition to her
three Vogue covers,

266
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,302
you may remember her as
the face of La Roque cosmetics.

267
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,810
Please welcome miss
Gabrielle Marquez!

268
00:13:33,654 --> 00:13:34,475
Vern?

269
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:35,667
A moment.

270
00:13:40,998 --> 00:13:41,819
Is there a problem?

271
00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:42,603
Yes!

272
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,654
What am I supposed to do with
that petting zoo out there?

273
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,230
Not everyone wins the
genetic lottery like you did.

274
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:48,830
These girls need help

275
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,104
finding the promised land
of beauty and style.

276
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,759
Please, Gabrielle,
be their moses.

277
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:57,247
Good comparison,

278
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,174
because it's gonna take a miracle
to turn these mutts into show dogs.

279
00:14:03,546 --> 00:14:05,698
Hey, girls,
let's talk beauty.

280
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,427
What's up, brother?

281
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:18,700
I'm sorry. You are...

282
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,124
Carlos from
down the street.

283
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,378
We were only
best friends, dude.

284
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:30,358
Things have been
a little fuzzy,

285
00:14:30,964 --> 00:14:31,922
since the accident.

286
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:34,785
I'm sorry that I, uh,
I hadn't come by sooner,

287
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,003
but my divorce has
been kicking my ass.

288
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:39,050
I'm sorry to hear that.

289
00:14:39,404 --> 00:14:42,707
Anyway, I got a new condo,
but it's getting renovated,

290
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,849
So I was thinking
maybe I could crash here.

291
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:47,564
Here?

292
00:14:47,665 --> 00:14:50,375
Yeah, I could help you
out around the house,

293
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,917
and free you up to focus
on job one,

294
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:54,109
getting better.

295
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:57,311
'Cause you're tossing it
to Edie now, right?

296
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:00,309
That's a real
relationship killer,

297
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,884
needing your lady
to hoist you off the can.

298
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,245
How long are we talking?

299
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:08,828
Couple months.
Three at the most.

300
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,217
And, of course, I can kick in
for half the utilities and rent.

301
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,095
Well, how can I say no
to my best friend?

302
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:27,346
Can you do a kickflip?

303
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:30,766
What are the Blake kids
doing all the way over here?

304
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:33,186
Pam needs to keep
a closer eye on them.

305
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:35,378
Will you please come
away from that window?

306
00:15:35,379 --> 00:15:37,787
You barely slept last night.
Come on. Take a nap.

307
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,723
I'm fine. I'm fine.

308
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:43,450
Hold on.

309
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:52,831
Hey, what's up?

310
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,119
I've been meaning to
get this back to you,

311
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:56,537
and to thank you.

312
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,665
Rebecca and I really
enjoyed the cake.

313
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,343
Oh! Good.

314
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:03,596
So...

315
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,319
Bye.

316
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,429
So what'd you think
of our place?

317
00:16:10,412 --> 00:16:10,999
Sorry?

318
00:16:12,027 --> 00:16:14,129
I heard you were good friends
with the Young family.

319
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,885
It must have been weird being in
there with all the new furniture.

320
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:19,140
I didn't notice.

321
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:20,638
Well, how about
the kitchen?

322
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:23,390
Rebecca likes the color,
but I'm not so sure.

323
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:26,410
Oh, sorry. Never made it
past the living room.

324
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:29,741
What?! Come on!
You're in an empty house,

325
00:16:29,742 --> 00:16:31,526
curious about
your new neighbors...

326
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,984
You look around.
We all do it.

327
00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:35,429
Well, I don't.

328
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:41,410
Well, next time you're over,
I'll have to give you the tour.

329
00:16:41,942 --> 00:16:42,491
Great, great.

330
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,513
Mr. Protector man!

331
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,348
Hey, hey,
not now, Parker.

332
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,646
I just wanted to see if I can
play his pinball machine again.

333
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:00,210
I guess there's no
need for that tour.

334
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,031
All right, girls,
first things first things first.

335
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:12,598
If you can't walk,
you can't win.

336
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:13,783
Hit it, Vern!

337
00:17:15,216 --> 00:17:18,656
Remember, eyes forward,
shoulders back, hips square.

338
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,852
Look left, look right,
whip and walk.

339
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,498
Yes, I'm unbelievable.
Close your mouths.

340
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:46,673
Stop, stop.

341
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:48,093
What?

342
00:17:48,378 --> 00:17:51,055
My eyes were forward,
my hips were square.

343
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,469
But where's your confidence?
Where's your pride?

344
00:17:54,681 --> 00:17:57,239
Come on. What do
I have to be proud of?

345
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:10,654
Have you guys ever
seen a runway model

346
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,687
without the hot
clothes and makeup?

347
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,464
Well, trust me,
they're not that special,

348
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,514
But the one thing that
they do have is attitude.

349
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,669
You have to
believe in yourself,

350
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:25,919
and if not, pretend to
believe in yourself, okay?

351
00:18:27,554 --> 00:18:28,252
All right.

352
00:18:28,813 --> 00:18:31,823
Now I want you to pretend
you're on the runway...

353
00:18:32,207 --> 00:18:33,947
Flashbulbs are popping,

354
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,177
everyone's looking at you,
envying you,

355
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,989
and they're all thinking
the same thing...

356
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:44,492
Isabel Horowitz
is smoking hot!

357
00:18:46,979 --> 00:18:48,404
Go, Isabel! Go!

358
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,730
You're doing it!
Isabel, you're doing it!

359
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:57,134
That's it! Keep going!

360
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:04,059
I was walking!

361
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,449
You were
totally walking!

362
00:19:06,998 --> 00:19:08,071
Good job!

363
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,516
All right, Donna, you're next.

364
00:19:10,185 --> 00:19:12,114
Get up there and make
me hate your beauty.

365
00:19:15,384 --> 00:19:18,023
Now this place is a real
diamond in the rough.

366
00:19:18,587 --> 00:19:20,804
Cozy little
two-bedroom plus den,

367
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,125
with a highly
motivated seller.

368
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,885
Oh, look, a highly
motivated cockroach.

369
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,127
Let's try to be
positive, people.

370
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,578
It's a fabulous location.

371
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:35,280
Just walking distance
to all sorts of fun shops.

372
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:39,641
Right, from here I can see a bail
bondsman and an adult bookshop.

373
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,860
What do you expect in
your price range, "Tara"?

374
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:47,204
Let's go.

375
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:48,190
Thank you.

376
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,306
Wait.

377
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,848
I'm not an
impractical woman.

378
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:54,531
I know that my son's
resources are...

379
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,455
like his achievements,
rather limited.

380
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,103
I want to see
the rest of it.

381
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:02,466
Okay.

382
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,427
Now the lighting in the
kitchen is a bit harsh.

383
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,459
The previous owner...
Well, let's just say

384
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,664
he ran some sort of
home-based medical business.

385
00:20:12,483 --> 00:20:14,586
You cannot let your mother
move into this neighborhood.

386
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:16,888
It's filled with
junkies and whores.

387
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,287
And we'll owe
them all an apology,

388
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:19,672
but who cares?
She likes it.

389
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,637
Of course she likes it.

390
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:23,138
There's a 24-hour liquor
store across the street.

391
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,346
She wants a house.

392
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:27,025
This ithe best we can afford
without bankrupting ourselves.

393
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:29,122
Orson, what if something
should happen to her?

394
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,042
Stop worrying about her.
Worry about us.

395
00:20:32,237 --> 00:20:34,569
Do you realize how much we've
been fighting since she came?

396
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:36,883
The woman's ruined
every relationship

397
00:20:36,907 --> 00:20:38,712
that's mattered to me,
and she's doing it again.

398
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:40,727
Oh, my God!

399
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:45,189
-Are you all right?
-Oh! Mother?

400
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:48,407
It's just a little spill.
Her cane hit a loose tile.

401
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:49,581
Is anything broken?

402
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,859
Well, obviously, the damn floor.

403
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,620
We'll need that fixed
before she moves in.

404
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:54,828
Are you insane?!

405
00:20:54,873 --> 00:20:56,847
She obviously can't
be on her own.

406
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:58,301
Why, it's a loose tile.

407
00:20:58,308 --> 00:21:00,592
-I'm perfectly fine.
-And what if you weren't?

408
00:21:00,762 --> 00:21:03,854
What if she had broken something
and she was lying here for hours?

409
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:05,236
You are coming home with us.

410
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:05,621
Bree...

411
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:07,920
And I will not hear
another word on the subject.

412
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,077
I can't believe
you bought us pizza.

413
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,776
Well, you guys earned it.

414
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,759
But eat fast, because we only
have one hour left, and I want

415
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,505
to introduce you to your new
best friend, Mr. Spray Tan.

416
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,413
You know so much cool stuff.

417
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:25,132
Can't you come back another day?

418
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:26,541
Oh, I don't know.

419
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,263
-Please?
-You have to.

420
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,230
Well, let me
check my book.

421
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:32,895
I might have to move
some stuff around,

422
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:34,029
but I think I can swing it.

423
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:36,672
Your life must be
so exciting, huh?

424
00:21:37,813 --> 00:21:39,852
Yeah, every
day's a parade.

425
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,265
So what was it like
being a famous model?

426
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,821
Honestly, it was
like any other job,

427
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:49,444
except the pay was great,
the clothes were couture,

428
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,787
and the parties were
just this side of Gomorrah.

429
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:55,885
You don't know what
Gomorrah means, do you?

430
00:21:58,603 --> 00:21:59,287
Good.

431
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:01,617
Did you know Kate Moss?

432
00:22:02,164 --> 00:22:03,555
I invited her to a party once.

433
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:04,796
Did you eat pizza with her?

434
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:07,519
'Cause if you did, it's almost
like we ate pizza with her.

435
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,404
Well, honey, most
models don't eat pizza.

436
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:12,458
Well, at least not without
having a finger for dessert.

437
00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:15,392
Gross.

438
00:22:15,807 --> 00:22:16,980
I know. I never did that.

439
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,929
You would not believe the horrible
things these girls did to stay skinny.

440
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:22,063
Like what?

441
00:22:22,354 --> 00:22:25,501
Well, some would smoke those
unfiltered french cigarettes.

442
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,646
But cigarettes
can kill you.

443
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,811
But before they do,
they kill your appetite.

444
00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:33,048
One time,

445
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:36,625
there was a girl who took
too many laxatives, and, uh...

446
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,614
Well, if you're ever at the
Chateau Milan in room 238,

447
00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:41,623
do not use the jacuzzi.

448
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:45,084
Do you have to be
skinny to be a model?

449
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,851
Well, yeah. When's the last time you
saw a fat person on a magazine cover?

450
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:52,010
Now I'm gonna go talk to
Vern about our next session.

451
00:22:52,124 --> 00:22:54,197
You guys finish lunch
so we can get back to work.

452
00:23:07,383 --> 00:23:08,763
Hi, Rupert!

453
00:23:09,063 --> 00:23:12,366
I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes
for the weekend, and while I was there,

454
00:23:12,367 --> 00:23:13,893
I got something for you.

455
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:16,747
I thought you could
wear it on your day off.

456
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,477
Do you like it?

457
00:23:20,478 --> 00:23:21,478
Very much.

458
00:23:22,243 --> 00:23:23,409
It'll come in handy,

459
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:26,188
should my nationality
ever slip my mind.

460
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,287
That was good.

461
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:34,045
You... I wanna
party with you.

462
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,092
Hey, I was thinking this afternoon
maybe we could go look for that drawer.

463
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,525
Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.

464
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:42,519
I'm afraid I have
all this silver to polish.

465
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,394
Well, let me help you,
and we can talk.

466
00:23:45,738 --> 00:23:48,806
There is so much
I wanna know about you.

467
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,458
Who is Rupert
Cavanaugh?

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,406
What makes him tick?

469
00:23:56,756 --> 00:24:00,157
Tell you what. Let's go
find you that drawer, hmm?

470
00:24:03,134 --> 00:24:05,128
Oh, isn't the master
bedroom down that way?

471
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:07,302
I realize it's
a bit of a jaunt,

472
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:10,585
But I managed to find
you an entire bureau.

473
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:14,293
Okay, well, you certainly
didn't have to go to all that...

474
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:16,492
trouble.

475
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:18,727
Is there a problem?

476
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,221
No, I just, um...

477
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,680
Well, all I really needed
was just a little...

478
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,406
Little drawer, and, uh...

479
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,556
this is just so far away
and what is that smell?

480
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,967
Oh, yes, about that...

481
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:35,865
The cat passed
away in this room.

482
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:39,739
Did you consider
removing the body?

483
00:24:40,025 --> 00:24:41,555
Well, if this
isn't acceptable,

484
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:43,763
I can look elsewhere
for a drawer

485
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:45,668
when I have the time.

486
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,323
Why do you have
to be this way?

487
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:50,706
What way is that?

488
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:53,200
Listen, I know how
you feel about Jane,

489
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,130
but if you could just
give me a chance...

490
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:56,448
I mean, come on,

491
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:59,852
you can't possibly hate
me this much, can you?

492
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:02,077
I'm done.

493
00:25:02,614 --> 00:25:04,633
Fine. Fine,
fine, fine, fine.

494
00:25:04,892 --> 00:25:06,553
I don't need you
to like me,

495
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,108
but I think you should
give me just a little respect.

496
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:10,757
I am Ian's girlfriend.

497
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:13,252
He's still married.

498
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,815
At best,
you're his mistress.

499
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:20,547
Okay, you are not
allowed to call me that.

500
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:23,750
Fine. What term
would you prefer?

501
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:26,384
Concubine? Consort?

502
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,417
Gold-digging whore?

503
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:31,767
I'm so sorry.

504
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,895
I'm, I shouldn't
have done that.

505
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,898
But, Rupert,
you have to admit,

506
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:37,293
it's just a drawer.

507
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,762
Those drawers are
filled with Jane's things.

508
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,396
This is her house.

509
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:44,702
You are a guest
in her house,

510
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:46,864
and a temporary
one at best.

511
00:25:46,865 --> 00:25:49,996
Okay, you know,
that is for Ian to decide.

512
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:51,613
Oh, he has decided.

513
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:55,422
Why do you think he never
told me about you?

514
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:58,296
Why did he wait so long
to bring you here?

515
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:00,812
He didn't want you
in that room,

516
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:06,430
where he still keeps Jane's
things exactly as she left them.

517
00:26:11,756 --> 00:26:12,362
But...

518
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,040
I'll keep looking
for that drawer.

519
00:26:21,093 --> 00:26:22,794
Hey, I'm going
over to Mike's.

520
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,377
I thought you were
gonna mow the lawn.

521
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:28,160
I know. It's just that I promised
I'd help him install a shower bar,

522
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:30,338
And, um,
it could take a while.

523
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:31,596
Okay.

524
00:26:35,937 --> 00:26:38,237
T-Rex. How they
hanging, brother?

525
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,793
Low and lazy.

526
00:26:39,794 --> 00:26:41,025
-Here you go.
-Yeah.

527
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,173
Hey, if Lynette asks,

528
00:26:43,726 --> 00:26:45,367
I installed your
shower bar today.

529
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,383
Got it.

530
00:26:50,222 --> 00:26:51,911
Vern, what are
you doing here?

531
00:26:51,956 --> 00:26:52,676
We need to talk.

532
00:26:52,693 --> 00:26:53,867
Is it about the
girls' makeup?

533
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,825
'Cause I got them each
their own makeup kit,

534
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:57,956
custom-tailored
to match their skin tone.

535
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,453
And I got melina some wax.
I know she's only 11,

536
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:03,121
but those greek genes are
gonna kick in any day now.

537
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:05,457
What?

538
00:27:05,613 --> 00:27:08,247
This morning, Mrs. Hayes caught
Donna her finger down her throat,

539
00:27:08,248 --> 00:27:09,859
trying to barf up
her toaster waffle.

540
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:11,742
Really?

541
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:14,678
And Mrs. Horowitz found Isabel
behind their garage smoking.

542
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:17,809
Apparently, she thought cigarettes
would help her lose a few pounds.

543
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,623
Where do you think
she got that idea?

544
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:23,631
Those damn tobacco companies!

545
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:24,267
Gaby!

546
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,532
Fine, I may have told a few
stories about the old days,

547
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:28,896
but as a warning.

548
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,889
I didn't say anything
inappropriate for kids.

549
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:33,570
Cassie Warren asked her mother
If she could throw a Gomorrah party.

550
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:37,797
Okay, look, we have to do
damage control. I get it.

551
00:27:38,012 --> 00:27:40,099
Next session,
I'll apologize to all the moms.

552
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,100
Unh-unh, there's not gonna
be a next session for you.

553
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:45,950
The moms don't want you
anywhere near their daughters.

554
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:48,747
But I'm helping them.

555
00:27:49,071 --> 00:27:50,359
They love me!

556
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,555
Wait, please, Vern,

557
00:27:51,556 --> 00:27:53,707
you have to give me
a chance to fix this.

558
00:27:53,752 --> 00:27:56,736
It's too late, Gaby. You are
now officially a bad influence.

559
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,088
Well, see you
at spin class.

560
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,123
Mom said we couldn't leave.

561
00:28:15,838 --> 00:28:17,323
I'm just going out front.

562
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:24,231
What the hell is that?!

563
00:28:24,544 --> 00:28:27,084
Stop running the ball!

564
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:29,704
Can I ask you
guys something?

565
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:33,694
What was I like
before the accident?

566
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,495
What do you mean?

567
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,534
I mean,
what kind of guy was I?

568
00:28:37,535 --> 00:28:39,720
Was I happy? Was I angry?

569
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,419
Did I ever get violent?

570
00:28:46,764 --> 00:28:47,721
You were fine.

571
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:54,770
I'm serious.

572
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:56,968
I really need to know.

573
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,336
You can be honest.
You're my best friend.

574
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,319
Honestly?

575
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,916
You were sort of mysterious,
kept to yourself.

576
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,451
Nobody really knew
you all that well.

577
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:17,423
And this is coming
from your best friend.

578
00:29:25,992 --> 00:29:27,008
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

579
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:28,260
Yes!

580
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,760
I'm sorry, guys,
I just...

581
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,373
I guess I was really tired.

582
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:41,950
Where's your brother?

583
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,076
-He went outside.
-Yeah.

584
00:29:45,431 --> 00:29:46,017
What...

585
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,199
Okay, watch her!
Watch her.

586
00:29:49,391 --> 00:29:50,982
I'll be back.
I'll be right back.

587
00:29:52,544 --> 00:29:54,900
Hello? Open up!
Open the door!

588
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,081
Lynette? What's the matter?

589
00:29:57,259 --> 00:29:58,099
I want my son.

590
00:29:58,515 --> 00:29:59,261
He's not here.

591
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,400
He's not at our house,
he's not in our yard.

592
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:03,569
Do not jerk me around.

593
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:04,693
Parker!

594
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,459
You can't just barge into
my house like this, Lynette.

595
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,899
Don't play dumb with me.

596
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,265
I know exactly what
is down here!

597
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:16,471
Where's the pinball?
Where's all the games?

598
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:19,700
Oh, that was a collection I was
taking up for the children's hospital.

599
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:23,373
I delivered
everything yesterday.

600
00:30:26,696 --> 00:30:28,299
Did you donate
the photos, too?

601
00:30:32,311 --> 00:30:33,300
Parker!

602
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:38,666
What exactly is it
you're accusing me of?

603
00:30:38,667 --> 00:30:41,281
Don't pretend you don't know.
I'm calling the police.

604
00:30:41,502 --> 00:30:42,379
Parker!

605
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:43,416
Is there a problem?

606
00:30:44,587 --> 00:30:45,648
You're damn right
there's a problem.

607
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:47,371
I can't find my son.

608
00:30:48,892 --> 00:30:49,947
Isn't that your son?

609
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:01,779
Hey, hey!

610
00:31:03,303 --> 00:31:05,375
Where have you been?!

611
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:08,063
We were at Mike's.
He wandered over looking for me.

612
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:09,536
What's going on?

613
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:22,646
Well, that was the
children's hospital.

614
00:31:23,335 --> 00:31:24,957
Art's story checks out.

615
00:31:25,611 --> 00:31:27,155
He donated all that stuff.

616
00:31:29,894 --> 00:31:32,784
That proves nothing. He knew I was on
to him. He had to dump it someplace.

617
00:31:32,785 --> 00:31:34,802
Honey, believe me,
I am with you.

618
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,682
There is something fishy
about this guy.

619
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:37,928
But you gotta get a grip.

620
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:40,295
You can't go barging
into people's homes.

621
00:31:40,296 --> 00:31:42,877
-What if Parker had been in there?
-But he wasn't,

622
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,847
And if you keep accusing
this guy whout proof,

623
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:48,456
he can sue us.

624
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:52,791
Listen...

625
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:56,930
I've been thinking that after everything
that you have been through...

626
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,791
Please don't bring up
the supermarket again.

627
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,613
That was
a traumatic experience.

628
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:03,297
I think it's affected you
more than you realize.

629
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,494
And maybe you need to talk
to somebody about it...

630
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:14,957
Like a therast.

631
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,600
You're right.
I need to talk to someone.

632
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:25,799
He'd gotten rid
of everything...

633
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,164
The toys, the pictures,
everything was gone.

634
00:32:32,105 --> 00:32:33,395
You can't sit
on this, Lynette.

635
00:32:33,668 --> 00:32:35,134
I know!

636
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:39,107
If something happened to someone's
kid because I kept my mouth shut...

637
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,890
The thing is,
I promised Tom I'd back off.

638
00:32:45,155 --> 00:32:46,464
Well, I didn't.

639
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,423
Jane has
some beautiful things.

640
00:33:08,382 --> 00:33:11,053
Yes, she's always had
impeccable taste.

641
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:17,800
I, um, I know how
it must seem to you.

642
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:19,981
My holding on to them.

643
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:23,081
But I justouldn't
bring myself to...

644
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:23,961
I get it.

645
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,026
As much as I have
tried to pretend that

646
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,102
it's just you and me.

647
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,605
There's three of us
in this relationship.

648
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,986
Susan, you know
I adore you.

649
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,449
No, please, listen...

650
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,168
The last couple of months,

651
00:33:41,781 --> 00:33:43,263
I thought we've
gotten really close,

652
00:33:43,264 --> 00:33:44,897
and I have been loving that.

653
00:33:45,452 --> 00:33:46,957
I just feel like lately...

654
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,355
There's thisimit to how
far you'll let me in.

655
00:33:53,978 --> 00:33:55,339
Well, I'm trying.

656
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:59,297
It's just the, um, the more
I let you into my heart,

657
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:02,197
the more I feel I'm
pushing Jane out and...

658
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:05,656
You don't have to push
Jane out to let me in.

659
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:11,700
Of course. You're right.

660
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,195
Do you know what I think?

661
00:34:18,794 --> 00:34:19,235
No.

662
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:24,114
That kind of compassionate wisdom
deserves an obscenely expensive meal.

663
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:26,899
Okay, well,
give me a minute,

664
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,019
and I will change
into something nice.

665
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,116
Rupert still hasn't
found you a drawer?

666
00:34:32,922 --> 00:34:34,075
No, not just yet.

667
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,412
Well, in that case...

668
00:34:43,646 --> 00:34:45,229
Ian, you don't
have to do that.

669
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,100
If I can make room in
my heart for both of you,

670
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,629
I can certainly make
room in my bureau.

671
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,700
It's just not right.
Your mother skipped lunch, too.

672
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:02,025
She said she
wasn't hungry.

673
00:35:02,292 --> 00:35:04,300
Can't we just revel
in her absence?

674
00:35:04,462 --> 00:35:07,277
I know she's a handful, but she
deserves some compassion.

675
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:10,259
The woman watched
a dream die yesterday.

676
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:15,070
I'm taking her dinner up.

677
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:16,926
Oh, that's okay.
I'll do it.

678
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,694
Oh, no,
I'd rather do it myself.

679
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:20,103
I wanna talk to her.

680
00:35:20,214 --> 00:35:22,193
Oh, well, I'll let her
know you're coming.

681
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,505
Mom's coming.
Ditch the wine.

682
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:29,697
Very well.

683
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:32,389
You finished the
whole bottle already?

684
00:35:33,477 --> 00:35:35,509
I was... thirsty.

685
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:37,165
Gloria, I've been
thinking and...

686
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,408
Does no one in this house
ever bother to knock?

687
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:40,993
Is that alcohol?

688
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,821
Where did you get that?

689
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,486
Andrew!

690
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:51,422
When my grandma asks me a favor
with tears in her eyes, how...

691
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:53,639
Oh, shut up,
you little extortionist.

692
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,011
He charged me 20 bucks,
plus 5 for the corkscrew.

693
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:58,492
I'll deal with you later.

694
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:01,508
You can kiss that
codeine good-bye.

695
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:06,207
Andrew brought her wine.

696
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,703
Oh, for God's sake.

697
00:36:08,778 --> 00:36:09,794
This is our house.

698
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,518
If you expect to stay here, You're
going to learn to obey a few rules.

699
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:17,574
I don't obey rules.
I make them.

700
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:18,885
Not anymore, mother.

701
00:36:18,997 --> 00:36:22,112
Just watch yourself,
sonny boy.

702
00:36:22,737 --> 00:36:23,690
Okay, look,

703
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,001
I know you're upset, but don't
blame Orson. It's not his fault.

704
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,100
It's all his fault.

705
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,848
You think he's so wonderful.

706
00:36:32,095 --> 00:36:33,869
You don't know the half
of what he's done.

707
00:36:34,423 --> 00:36:37,112
Let's go. I can't deal with
her when she's like this.

708
00:36:37,682 --> 00:36:39,164
He doesn't want you
to hear the truth,

709
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:40,621
how he cheated on Alma.

710
00:36:42,557 --> 00:36:43,117
What?

711
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:45,647
She's drunk!

712
00:36:45,671 --> 00:36:47,969
How he broke her
heart... and mine,

713
00:36:48,244 --> 00:36:50,647
All for his precious Monique.

714
00:36:50,671 --> 00:36:52,064
You shut up, mother.

715
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,382
Monique Polier?

716
00:36:54,221 --> 00:36:56,200
I thought that was
Harvey Bigsby's mistress.

717
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:59,436
Oh, she got around,
that girl!

718
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,973
See, I told you.
I told you she would do this.

719
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,099
There he was,
cheating on Alma,

720
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,621
not knowing all the time his
whore was cheating on him.

721
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,126
Stop it!
You shut your evil mouth!

722
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:10,979
Or what?!

723
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,989
What are you gonna do to me
that hasn't already been done?

724
00:37:24,972 --> 00:37:25,598
Bree...

725
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:26,809
Bree!

726
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,371
Bree, no!

727
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,778
Bree, wait!

728
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:32,493
Bree!

729
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,964
I know. I thought
it was so adorable.

730
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:04,636
-Skirt...
-I know!

731
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:08,509
Miss Gabrielle!

732
00:38:10,027 --> 00:38:11,454
What is she doing here?

733
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,510
I have no idea.

734
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:13,918
I told her she was banned.

735
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:16,004
Okay, just give
me a minute.

736
00:38:17,334 --> 00:38:20,458
I'm sorry about what
I said to the girls,

737
00:38:20,459 --> 00:38:22,085
and it won't
happen again.

738
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:25,379
Damn right. You're not going
anywhere near our girls.

739
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:28,000
Can't you give me
a second chance?

740
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:29,049
Why should we?

741
00:38:29,189 --> 00:38:33,686
Yeah, I mean, you walk in here all
clickety-clack, perfect little miss size zero,

742
00:38:33,716 --> 00:38:35,267
thinking you're all
better than us.

743
00:38:35,762 --> 00:38:38,440
We all saw the look on your
face when you showed up.

744
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,700
I don't think
I'm better than you.

745
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:43,328
Hell, I envy you.

746
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:44,666
Please.

747
00:38:44,853 --> 00:38:46,217
No, it's true.

748
00:38:46,512 --> 00:38:50,708
You have husbands and families and
a reason to wake up in the morning.

749
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,197
What do I have?

750
00:38:53,287 --> 00:38:54,010
Him.

751
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,134
Teaching your kids
about confidence and

752
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,625
beauty is the most useful
thing I've done since...

753
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,656
I don't know when.

754
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:07,433
And as much as
I've helped them...

755
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,110
They've helped me
so much more.

756
00:39:14,318 --> 00:39:15,901
So please, I need this.

757
00:39:20,697 --> 00:39:23,922
And I promise, no more talk
about dodgy weight loss methods.

758
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:31,253
Like the highly effective,
non-F.D.A. approved diet pill

759
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:32,914
I can get from my
friends in zurich...

760
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:35,457
in bulk.

761
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,836
Well, I suppose the Christian
thing would be to forgive her.

762
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:49,353
Well, why don't you
ladies talk it over?

763
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:52,165
And I'm gonna work on
posture with the girls.

764
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:53,386
Yeah! Come on!

765
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:54,626
Come on, you guys.
Let's go!

766
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:55,959
As long they're safe...

767
00:40:03,514 --> 00:40:04,862
Oh, thank God.

768
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:08,125
I've been driving around
all night looking for you.

769
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:13,266
We saw that woman
at the morgue...

770
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:15,206
On our wedding night.

771
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,072
You pretended
not to know her.

772
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,476
Bree, I can explain.

773
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,277
No.

774
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:24,514
I'm done.

775
00:40:25,163 --> 00:40:27,235
You don't understand
what happened.

776
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:29,416
There were two women
in your life before me.

777
00:40:29,624 --> 00:40:33,100
One vanished, and the other was killed.
That's all I need to understand.

778
00:40:36,188 --> 00:40:37,751
I've packed some
of your things.

779
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,934
I want you out of the house.

780
00:40:43,465 --> 00:40:44,169
Now.

781
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:48,141
Bree...

782
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:50,571
Please...

783
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,669
I love you.

784
00:40:54,331 --> 00:40:55,132
I know...

785
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,714
but it scares
the hell out of me.

786
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:12,498
Dangerous men
walk among us,

787
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,500
and we can't always
be sure of who they are

788
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,125
or what secrets they hide.

789
00:41:19,534 --> 00:41:22,681
But once our worst
suspicions are confirmed,

790
00:41:24,321 --> 00:41:26,099
we can take action.

791
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:31,475
Once their agendas
are revealed...

792
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,175
We can take steps,

793
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,454
to protect ourselves,

794
00:41:38,326 --> 00:41:40,163
and those we love.

795
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:55,263
Yes, dangerous men
can cause great harm.

796
00:42:02,766 --> 00:42:06,273
But sometimes the greatest
danger they pose...

797
00:42:08,726 --> 00:42:09,703
I'll take those.

798
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,920
Is to themselves.
