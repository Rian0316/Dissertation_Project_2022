Hold up the bus!

550
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,325
You see that?

551
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,699
Fender Stratocaster,
signed by Ritchie Blackmore.

552
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,533
- You know who<i> that</i> is, right?
- Someone no one's ever heard of?

553
00:29:06,959 --> 00:29:08,292
That's real good.

554
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:09,945
I hope your parents enjoy supporting you

555

Hey, fellas. Uh, you ready?

564
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:32,421
We got the first shot all lined up.

565
00:29:32,446 --> 00:29:34,661
- Can I walk you through it?
- Uh...

566
00:29:34,686 --> 00:29:36,092
We hate to do this to you, but...

567
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:37,717
- We're having second thoughts.
- Yeah.

568

I get it. That's just
nerves. Just stage fright.

It's just that it...

575
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:51,744

576

is where you're mistaken,

about the time slot?

I let<i> that</i> go. [Laughs]

to keep one thing, right?

I mean...

661
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:20,883

have for an old uniform.

00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:07,111
So... you gonna let us make this deal?

904
00:46:07,136 --> 00:46:08,821
You got the money?

905
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:12,789
Good.

906
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:14,193
[Sniffles]

907
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:17,068
Now, before we do this...

908
00:46:17,093 --> 00:46:20,176
I'm gonna need one more thing from you.

909
00:46:23,342 --> 00:46:26,476
- [Indistinct conversations]
- _

910
00:46:26,501 --> 00:46:28,448
[Intercom beeps]

911
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:31,120
Yes?

912
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:32,597
Okay.

913
00:46:33,187 --> 00:46:35,662
Miss Valco will see you now.

914
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,040
- Oh.
- Second door.

915
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:45,618
[Breathes sharply]

916
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,118
Hi there. Come on in.

917
00:46:48,143 --> 00:46:52,287
Yeah. Hi. I've...
called quite a few times

918
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:55,019
about an issue I'm trying to address.

919
00:46:55,044 --> 00:46:57,250
Do you have your policy number?

920
00:46:57,275 --> 00:46:58,555
No.

921
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,717
[Sighs]

922
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:02,702
Can you just look up my name? McGill?

923
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:10,566
Charles McGill of
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill?

924
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:13,141
No, that's my brother.

925
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,376
Um... [Clears throat]

926
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,886
I'm Jimmy. James McGill.

927
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:18,926
Solo practitioner.

928
00:47:19,923 --> 00:47:21,934
Oh. There you are.

929
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:24,368
Looks like you're all
paid up through the year.

930
00:47:24,393 --> 00:47:26,226
That's sort of the issue.

931
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:30,063
Long story short, through a
series of unfortunate events,

932
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:32,328
my license has been suspended.

933
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:34,203
Yes, I see that here.

934
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:35,679
Right. Well...

935
00:47:35,704 --> 00:47:37,504
I was hoping I could get a refund

936
00:47:37,529 --> 00:47:39,056
for the time that I won't be a lawyer.

937
00:47:39,081 --> 00:47:41,513
Now, that's only fair, right?

938
00:47:41,538 --> 00:47:44,286
I'm sorry, Mr. McGill.
It doesn't work like that.

939
00:47:44,311 --> 00:47:47,916
We don't refund for unused
malpractice insurance.

940
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:49,183
[Sighs] But it's a...

941
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,990
it's a lot of money for nothing.

942
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:53,906
I understand it seems that way,

943
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,564
but if one of your clients decides

944
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,855
they want to bring a suit against you,

945
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,242
this continues your coverage.

946
00:48:00,267 --> 00:48:01,590
[Snaps fingers] That's the thing.

947
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,159
My clients?

948
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:04,583
They love me.

949
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:07,612
And they would never
bring a suit against me.

950
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:10,234
I'm [Chuckling] extremely lovable.

951
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:11,831
I can see that.

952
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:14,557
But it's company policy.

953
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:16,440
[Snaps fingers]

954
00:48:16,465 --> 00:48:18,999
What about we put the insurance on hold?

955
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:21,138
And then, if someone
were to try to sue me...

956
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:22,587
which they won't...

957
00:48:22,612 --> 00:48:24,089
then we just, uh, [Clicks tongue]

958
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:26,432
kick that ol' policy back into gear?

959
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:29,296
I understand your situation. I do.

960
00:48:29,321 --> 00:48:31,114
But there are rules preventing us

961
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:33,765
from stopping and starting coverage.

962
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,684
And I regret to inform you that...

963
00:48:36,709 --> 00:48:39,361
when your license is
reinstated next year,

964
00:48:39,363 --> 00:48:40,529
because of the suspension,

965
00:48:40,554 --> 00:48:43,409
your premiums are going to... go up.

966
00:48:43,434 --> 00:48:45,381
Considerably.

967
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:48,680
How considerably?

968
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:52,022
Um... [Drawer opens]

969
00:48:54,945 --> 00:49:00,982
Looks like roughly... 150%.

970
00:49:03,484 --> 00:49:05,540
[Breathing sharply]

971
00:49:05,565 --> 00:49:07,171
[Chuckling] God.

972
00:49:08,777 --> 00:49:11,171
[Sniffling]

973
00:49:11,196 --> 00:49:13,363
[Drawer closes]

974
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,498
Mr. McGill?

975
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,439
[Sighs]

976
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:21,581
[Sniffles]

977
00:49:23,618 --> 00:49:25,635
Oh.

978
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,926
I...

979
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:29,054
Mr. McGill, I'm sorry.

980
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:31,913
I wish we could help
you, but we just can't.

981
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:33,474
[Sniffles]

982
00:49:33,499 --> 00:49:35,244
I'm sorry.

983
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,875
It's hard.

984
00:49:39,354 --> 00:49:41,656
Very, very hard.

985
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:42,853
[Sniffles]

986
00:49:42,878 --> 00:49:45,509
I'm just having a rough time.

987
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,846
I just need a break.

988
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:51,455
[Voice breaking] Just one break.

989
00:49:53,317 --> 00:49:57,445
And I know you... I know
you can't do anything, but...

990
00:49:57,618 --> 00:49:59,571
[Crying]

991
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:03,747
I'm getting run out on this
community service and...

992
00:50:03,772 --> 00:50:07,045
getting ripped off
left and right, and...

993
00:50:07,453 --> 00:50:09,353
my car won't start.

994
00:50:09,378 --> 00:50:11,119
[Chuckles]

995
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:14,242
My gal is disappointed in me, and...

996
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:16,335
my brother...

997
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,776
[Sniffles]

998
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:19,233
[Crying]

999
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:21,499
My brother is sick!

1000
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,433
And he's alone.

1001
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:29,546
I spent years caring for him, and...

1002
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:31,306
now he hates me.

1003
00:50:31,308 --> 00:50:33,877
He's the only family I got left,

1004
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:35,778
and he hates me.

1005
00:50:35,803 --> 00:50:38,082
He hates my guts.

1006
00:50:38,107 --> 00:50:40,606
Is this your brother, Charles?

1007
00:50:40,631 --> 00:50:42,412
- Oh.
- [Sniffles]

1008
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:45,738
And I pretend not to
care, but he's my brother.

1009
00:50:45,763 --> 00:50:47,633
How can I not?

1010
00:50:47,658 --> 00:50:50,241
He's mentally ill.

1011
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:53,862
He's... he's holed up in
a house with no electricity.

1012
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:56,585
He's working by the
light of gas lanterns.

1013
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,909
Wha...

1014
00:50:57,934 --> 00:51:01,031
He's making mistakes
with his clients. He's...

1015
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:03,868
mixin' up numbers on
important documents.

1016
00:51:03,893 --> 00:51:05,466
He... he...

1017
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,848
He had a complete mental breakdown

1018
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:10,606
at the bar hearing.

1019
00:51:10,631 --> 00:51:14,233
Your brother... he had
a breakdown in court?

1020
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:16,724
It's in the transcripts.

1021
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:18,278
[Sobbing]

1022
00:51:18,303 --> 00:51:21,104
God. And I'm worried, I'm just...

1023
00:51:21,129 --> 00:51:25,162
if he screws up with
one more big client...

1024
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,033
it's just gonna destroy him!

1025
00:51:30,071 --> 00:51:31,604
[Sniffles]

1026
00:51:31,629 --> 00:51:34,596
Oh, don't... don't write...

1027
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:36,707
What are you writing? No, don't write.

1028
00:51:36,732 --> 00:51:38,920
I-I didn't mean to say that.

1029
00:51:38,945 --> 00:51:41,646
I don't want him to get
in trouble with you guys

1030
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:43,971
- 'cause of me. I...
- Right.

1031
00:51:43,996 --> 00:51:46,863
I'm sorry. I'm gonna go.

1032
00:51:47,662 --> 00:51:50,251
You're not gonna do anything, are you?

1033
00:51:50,253 --> 00:51:52,861
I-I wouldn't worry about it, Mr. McGill.

1034
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:54,786
Uh, please feel better.

1035
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:56,594
I'm sorry.

1036
00:51:57,479 --> 00:52:00,136
Just for... uh, forget.
