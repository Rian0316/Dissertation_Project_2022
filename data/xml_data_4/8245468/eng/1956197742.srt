00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,035
Hi.
[chuckles]

362
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,417
All my life,

363
00:13:53,482 --> 00:13:55,584
all I ever wanted
was to be a mother.

364
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:57,626
But Randy was always
so against it.

365
00:13:57,691 --> 00:13:59,619
Wouldn't even talk about it.

366
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,035
But now I have you.

367
00:14:03,482 --> 00:14:05,417
You've given me
a second chance.

368
00:14:05,482 --> 00:14:06,834
- I have?
- Mm.

369
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:08,774
Frank...

370
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,459
would you fertilize my eggs?

371
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:14,376
Are you kidding me?

372
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:17,334
I would be honored to introduce
my little Frankies

373
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,875
to your little Ingrids.

374
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,376
- Oh, Frank.
- [chuckling]

375
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:22,994
Thank you so much.

376
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,793
[Debbie] But we never got
a bill.

377
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:28,084
No, I'm not still
at 4503 Wolfcrest.

378
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:30,244
That's my sister's old address.

379
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,911
Oh, well, is that where
you sent the bill?

380
00:14:35,733 --> 00:14:38,125
Okay, well, that makes sense.

381
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,566
Thank you.

382
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,947
[Kev] Are you sure
this is the right place?

383
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,634
[Veronica] This is the address
she gave me.

384
00:14:44,697 --> 00:14:46,209
Casa De Oro.

385
00:14:46,274 --> 00:14:48,619
Yep. This is the place.

386
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,953
[exhales deeply]

387
00:14:56,149 --> 00:14:57,292
Can I help you?

388
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,084
Yeah, uh, we're here
to see May?

389
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,334
Great, have a seat

390
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,125
and I'll let her know
you're here.

391
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,316
Thank you.

392
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,285
[Veronica] Excuse me.

393
00:15:17,566 --> 00:15:19,668
These remind me
of my group home.

394
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:22,292
Aw, they gave you candy?

395
00:15:22,357 --> 00:15:25,536
It was our supper.

396
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:30,994
[children] speaking Spanish

397
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:35,661
speaking Spanish

398
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,376
They look like runners.

399
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:50,296
I bet they're on the track team
or something.

400
00:15:51,982 --> 00:15:54,292
Do we get to name him
after he's ours?

401
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,584
I don't know.

402
00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,125
Little Kev.
[chuckles]

403
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,417
- Kevin Jr.
- Hmm!

404
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:04,000
KJ.
Ooh, that's good.

405
00:16:04,065 --> 00:16:05,566
KJ Ball.

406
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:09,125
KJ Ball?
Are you kidding me?

407
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:12,334
Sounds like a sports name
if I ever heard one.

408
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,917
God, I hope
he plays baseball.

409
00:16:13,982 --> 00:16:15,376
What if he plays soccer?

410
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,251
V, do not ruin this for me
right now, okay?

411
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:20,065
[scoffs]

412
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,035
No one's playing soccer.

[sighs]

429
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,536
Sweet Jesus.

430
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,703
Hi. Pardon me.

431
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,649
Ugh!

432
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,982
[scoffs]

433
00:17:10,168 --> 00:17:11,720
Hey, not the sound
you wanna hear

434
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:12,869
when you're eating
in a restaurant.

435
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:13,705
What's up?

436
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:15,668
Have you seen the gum
under all the tables?

437
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,125
- No.
- It's disgusting.

438
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,834
You know,
what do you guys do?

439
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,543
Make sure to chew gum
on your way over?

440
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,042
Like, "Going to Patsy's."

441
00:17:23,107 --> 00:17:24,376
Better chew some gum

442
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,793
"so I can shove it up
under the tables?"

443
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:28,441
Sorry.

444
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,982
God.

445
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,501
- [Fiona] Ugh.
- She okay?

446
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,543
I'm not sure.

447
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:37,668
She's acting kinda crazy.

448
00:17:37,733 --> 00:17:39,668
Little bit.

449
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:43,202
[grinder whirring]

450
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:45,709
What'd they say?

451
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:47,668
Two and a half months
past due.

452
00:17:47,803 --> 00:17:48,865
That's not that bad.

453
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:50,125
Not that bad?

454
00:17:50,189 --> 00:17:51,912
Do you not pay your bills
or something?

455
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,373
We don't use electricity.

456
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:54,662
It's against the Koran.

457
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:56,334
- Really?
- No, it's a joke.

458
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,709
You think Muslims don't
believe in electricity?

459
00:17:58,774 --> 00:18:00,750
So they gonna turn
the power back on or what?

460
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,751
Yeah, once I pay them $800

461
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:04,709
plus a reactivation fee

462
00:18:04,774 --> 00:18:06,501
plus a past due charge.

463
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,459
Fuckers. That's extortion.

464
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,292
Yeah, no shit.

465
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:11,959
Would you like me to send
a suicide bomber?

466
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,584
[chuckles]
Sweet of you to offer,

467
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:15,251
but no, thanks.
I think I'll just pay it.

468
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:16,875
Suit yourself.

469
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,634
None of the other bills
have been paid either:

470
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,917
gas, cable, water.

471
00:18:20,982 --> 00:18:23,953
- Whoops.
- [grinders whirring]

[rock music playing over radio]

473
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:32,376
- [Lip] Hey.
- [Brad] What's up, Tami?

474
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:34,899
Boys.

475
00:18:34,982 --> 00:18:36,626
I found a cool apartment
I want to show you.

476
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,751
Wanna check it out?

477
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,751
Uh... yeah, no, I would.

478
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,042
I'm just, uh... you know,

479
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,608
working.

480
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,709
Well, you get a lunch break,
don't you?

481
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:48,793
Uh, no, not really.

482
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,376
What the hell, Brad?

483
00:18:50,441 --> 00:18:52,543
You don't give your employees
a lunch break?

484
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:54,125
We got work to do.

485
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,834
We kinda just eat
whenever we can.

486
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:57,793
[laughing] What a dick.

487
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,917
Hey, Gordon Ramsay,
this isn't Hell's Kitchen.

488
00:18:59,982 --> 00:19:01,917
You know, people
get lunch breaks.

489
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,376
You should unionize.

490
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:04,774
Really?

491
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:06,709
Come on. Let's eat.

492
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,751
He'll be back in an hour.

493
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:10,167
It's your sister-in-law.

494
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,285
Yeah, and he's a Brad.

495
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:18,251
Now all we gotta do is wait.

496
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:20,459
I can't believe nobody's
ever thought of this.

497
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:22,875
Yeah, you know, if these people
can afford to pay for yoga,

498
00:19:22,984 --> 00:19:25,376
they can afford to pay me
to rent a scooter.

499
00:19:25,441 --> 00:19:26,441
[grunts]

500
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:29,566
Uh...

501
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:31,501
excuse me, um...

502
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,167
I think you have my scooter
in the back of your truck.

503
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,709
Your scooter?

504
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,793
Nah, these are public scooters.

505
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:37,000
We gotta share 'em.

506
00:19:37,065 --> 00:19:37,917
Yeah, you're not sharing them.

507
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,125
You're hogging them.

508
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,751
Well, I'm happy
to rent you one.

509
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:42,167
- Ten bucks.
- What?

510
00:19:42,232 --> 00:19:43,543
No, I... that...

511
00:19:43,608 --> 00:19:44,917
that's extortion.

512
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:47,501
Technically it's racketeering,
but sure.

513
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:49,417
Okay. I'll call
Better Business Bureau.

514
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,459
Okay. Whatever the fuck
that is.

515
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,584
Come on. We need these
to go get a boba.

516
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:55,042
And I, for one,
am not walking.

517
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,237
Yeah, we're going
to get boba.

518
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:58,448
Well, maybe if you took a walk
every once in a while,

519
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,834
you wouldn't have to spend
25 bucks on yoga.

520
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,451
I need a scooter, dude.
I just did an hour of hot yoga.

521
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:04,783
I don't know what
to tell you, dude.

522
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:05,806
They're already on the truck.

523
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:07,123
Them's the rules.

524
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,477
Fine.

525
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:11,608
Ten bucks.

526
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:13,000
- It's 15 now.
- What?

527
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,751
Yeah, 'cause you're ungrateful.

528
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:16,668
You know what?
This is such bullshit.

529
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:19,376
This neighborhood's
going to shit.

530
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,369
Fuck this.
I'm out.

531
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,953
- Thank you for your business.
- Mm.

532
00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:32,940
We good?

533
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,107
So far.

534
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:39,202
We're very excited.

No.

We will pass the jar around.

1108
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:50,084
- Hi.
- All right...

1109

- There you go.
- Thanks.

I mean, this could work, right?

1120
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:16,875
You know, when you
said basement,

1121
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,000
I was like, "The only people
who live in basements"

1122
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,875

I don't know that I can
ever thank you enough.

1141
00:44:05,691 --> 00:44:07,452

as my swimmers swim

may they fear no evil.

00:44:30,274 --> 00:44:32,417
May my rod and my staff

00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:34,251

00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:39,334
- Amen.
- Amen.

Hello, Doctor.

1156
00:44:43,065 --> 00:44:44,334
Frank, Ingrid.

1157
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,369
How are we looking?

00:44:55,691 --> 00:44:57,543

00:44:57,608 --> 00:44:58,959

1165
00:44:59,024 --> 00:45:00,441

00:45:00,524 --> 00:45:01,917

- [Frank] Hello, laddies.
- [Ingrid gasps]

out of the Petri dish.

That's my boys.

1170
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,751
So, uh, you think
our chances are good?

1171
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:10,917
I'm extremely optimistic.

1172
00:45:10,982 --> 00:45:12,107
Whew.

1173
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:13,024

00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,160
Don't thank me.
Thank Frank.

00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:24,793
- Thank you.
- You bet.

00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:26,940
Thank you.

1180
00:45:27,024 --> 00:45:28,584
[Tami] You guys have got
to start living like grown-ups,

1181
00:45:28,649 --> 00:45:30,334
and that starts
in the bathroom.

1182
00:45:30,399 --> 00:45:31,899
All right.

1183
00:45:31,982 --> 00:45:33,584
Okay. All right.

1184
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:37,417
Okay, okay, okay.

1185
00:45:37,482 --> 00:45:39,167
So you've got, uh,

1186
00:45:39,232 --> 00:45:41,793
a bottle of dishwashing liquid
in the shower

1187
00:45:41,858 --> 00:45:43,084
and a bar of soap
with five different colors

1188
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:44,917
of pubes on it.

1189
00:45:44,982 --> 00:45:46,834
Wait, you guys can't all
share one bar of soap.

1190
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:48,543
No, no, I don't.

1191
00:45:48,608 --> 00:45:49,959
That's why I have
the dishwashing liquid.

1192
00:45:50,024 --> 00:45:51,417
Is that why you always
smell like lemons?

1193
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,084
Yeah, I like lemons.

1194
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:55,167
[chuckles]
Once you're in your 20s,

1195
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:58,000
you should have at least two
bath towels that match.

1196
00:45:58,065 --> 00:45:59,584
Now that I'm in my 20s,
I'm just glad

1197
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:00,917

Um, I asked for no dressing.

1205
00:46:12,899 --> 00:46:15,459
- You sure?
- Yeah, positive.

1206
00:46:15,524 --> 00:46:17,203
Yeah, this dressing
contains mayonnaise,

1207
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:18,507
and I'm allergic to eggs.

1208
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,167
I'm allergic to people
with allergies.

1209
00:46:20,232 --> 00:46:21,459
You don't hear me whining.

1211
00:46:22,608 --> 00:46:24,190
Excuse me?

1212
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:26,459
I'd like to speak
to the manager.

1213
00:46:26,524 --> 00:46:27,733
Okay.

1214
00:46:30,065 --> 00:46:31,566
Hi.

1215
00:46:31,649 --> 00:46:32,543
You wanted to speak
to the manager?

1216
00:46:32,608 --> 00:46:34,417
What seems to be the problem?

1217
00:46:34,482 --> 00:46:35,793
- You're the manager?
- Mm-hmm.

1218
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:38,875
- Well, you're rude.
- Okay.

1219
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,292
- Oh, no, are you leaving?
- Yeah.

1220
00:46:41,357 --> 00:46:42,834
And I'm never coming back.

1221
00:46:42,899 --> 00:46:44,709
Okay, 'cause what
I could really use

1222
00:46:44,774 --> 00:46:47,042
are some more customers
who are allergic to food.

1223

Bye.

1224
00:46:51,691 --> 00:46:53,167
[Tami] This is alive.

1225
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:54,994
[Lip] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let me see.

1226
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:58,251
- What are you doing?
- Sterilizing it.

1227
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,834
Just a minute.
Kills the bacteria.

1228
00:46:59,899 --> 00:47:01,875
No, you guys.
That's a myth.

1229
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,668
It actually creates
super bacteria,

1230
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:05,501
which is even more dangerous.

1231
00:47:05,566 --> 00:47:06,584
Oh, you see, we're a bit
more worried about

1232
00:47:06,649 --> 00:47:08,584
super-tweaky
meth freaks, so...

1233
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:09,959
Okay, well,
sponges are, like,

1234
00:47:10,024 --> 00:47:12,015
five for a dollar,
so you shouldn't have

1235
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:13,507
a maintenance plan
for your sponge.

1236
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:14,834
When it gets dirty,
just throw it away.

1237
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,584
[Debbie] Gotcha.

1238
00:47:16,649 --> 00:47:18,417
Do you guys reuse your Q-tips?

1239
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:19,626
No, don't answer that.

1240
00:47:19,691 --> 00:47:21,953
Also, there's one more thing.

1241
00:47:23,524 --> 00:47:25,292
- What is this?
- It's a box of clean underwear.

1242
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:26,959
Yeah, we share our underwear.

1243
00:47:27,024 --> 00:47:27,917
I don't have time to fold.
Do you, Debs?

1244
00:47:27,982 --> 00:47:29,125
- Nope.
- Oh.

1245
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,107
Okay.

1246
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:33,793
All right, I'm a little
surprised I have to say this,

1247
00:47:33,858 --> 00:47:36,709
but you guys should each have
your own underwear.

1248
00:47:36,774 --> 00:47:38,209
Why do you give a shit?

1249
00:47:38,274 --> 00:47:39,459
No one's asking you

You can go.

1251
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:41,376
We had a mom once.

1252
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,626
She didn't stick around.

1253
00:47:42,691 --> 00:47:44,084
Okay, sorry.

1254
00:47:44,149 --> 00:47:45,543
I was just making a suggestion.

1255
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:46,899
So was I.

1256
00:47:46,982 --> 00:47:49,459
Hey, I thought I was
the angry one.

1257
00:47:49,524 --> 00:47:52,125
- What are you doing?
- Vampire power.

1258
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,543
Appliances use electricity
just from being plugged in.

1259
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:55,826
So that's why I'm
going to make sure

1260
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:57,875
shit stays unplugged
from now on.

1261
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:58,959
- [Tami] That's smart.
- [Lip] Whoa, watch out.

1262
00:47:59,024 --> 00:48:01,158
- Whoa, Jesus.
- What's up?

1263
00:48:01,244 --> 00:48:03,334
- [Debbie] Hi.
- Here.

1264
00:48:03,399 --> 00:48:05,911
- Where'd you get this from?
- [Carl] Yeah, I won a bet.

1265
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,417
[Debbie]
God, you guys, seriously.

1266
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:12,709
We do not need this fan
plugged in.

1267
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:14,285
I could fly a fucking kite
in here.

1268

1270
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,501
So for every one of these
we recharge,

1271
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:20,917
we make, like, 15 bucks.

1272
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:21,917
So we're gonna go out
every single day,

1273
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:22,751

and recharge 'em.

1274

1309

Got separated
from their families.

00:49:53,274 --> 00:49:55,459
- What the fuck?
- It's like the Trail of Tears.

I don't remember exactly
what that was,

1314
00:49:57,442 --> 00:49:59,176
but they wouldn't call it that
if they weren't crying.

1315
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,875
Well, they are here
illegally.

1316
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,584
[Veronica] They were
escaping violence.

1317
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:05,209
They came to Chicago
to escape violence?

1318

I don't see what
the big deal is.

1319

They got some hot meals,
somewhere to sleep.

1320

It's kind of like
a summer camp for them.

They got separated
from their parents.

You know, their lives
were so shitty

1327
00:50:25,899 --> 00:50:28,125
that they risked everything
to come to this country,
