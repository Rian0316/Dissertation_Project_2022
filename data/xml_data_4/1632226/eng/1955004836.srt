1
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,190
Water Demon.

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,500
Ice Dragon.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,670
Lesser Warlord
of Ka'a.

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,700
Not so fast.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,470
Infinite Sheldon.

6
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,610
Infinite Sheldon?

7
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,310
Yes, Infinite Sheldon
defeats all other cards

8
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,900
and does not violate the
rule against homemade cards

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,820
because I made
it at work.

10
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,650
Do you understand why people
don't want to play with you?

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,260
No...

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,690
although it's a question I've
been pondering since preschool.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,460
Hey.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,420
Hey, your copy of <i>Science</i>
magazine was in my mailbox.

15
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,340
- Oh, thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,570
Check it out--
all about planets this month.

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,610
That's an atom.

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,080
Agree to disagree.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,450
That's what I love
about science--

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,150
there's no
one right answer.

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,220
So...

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,820
you and Zack again, huh?

23
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,760
Yeah, yeah, me
and Zack again.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,360
Were we here earlier?

25
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,190
Okay, we should,
we should go.

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,250
Ah, not yet.

27
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,610
I want to talk science
with the science dudes.

28
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,400
Oh, and the science dudes want
to talk science with you.

29
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,870
What do you want
to talk about--

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:31,010
rocks, dinosaurs, our
friend the beaver?

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,510
You know, I saw this great thing
on the Discovery Channel.

32
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,380
Turns out
that if you kill a starfish,

33
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,550
it'll just come back to life.

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,220
Was the starfish
wearing boxer shorts?

35
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,490
Because you might have
been watching Nickelodeon.

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,890
No, I'm almost sure that
it was the Discovery Channel.

37
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,160
It was a great show.

38
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,330
They also said dolphins
might be smarter than people.

39
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,940
They might be smarter
than <i>some</i> people.

40
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,660
Maybe we can do an
experiment to find out.

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,110
That's easy enough.

42
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,210
We'd need a large tank of
water, a hoop to jump through,

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,650
and a bucket of whatever
bite-sized treats

44
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,780
you find tasty.

45
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,160
I don't get it.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,590
A dolphin might.

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,200
Oh, I see.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,330
You guys are inferring
that I'm stupid.

49
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,600
That's not correct.

50
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,490
We were implying it.

51
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,710
You then inferred it.

52
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,680
Let's go.

53
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,650
You know, for a group of guys

54
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,280
who claim they spent most
of their lives being bullied,

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,830
you can be real jerks.

56
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,650
Shame on all of you.

57
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,320
What the hell did I do?

58
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,830

69
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,920
Do you think
Penny's right?

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,650
Were we bullying Zack?

71
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,400
No,

72
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,860
I know bullying.

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,700
He left here unswirlied and his
ass crack was underpants-free.

74
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,730
And nobody drew
a penis on his forehead.

75
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,870
That happened to you?

76
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,540
First day of cricket camp.

77
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,980
They drew it
so the testicles were my eyes.

78
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,950
I don't know, I think
we might owe the guy an apology.

79
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,420
So go apologize.
Why me?

80
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,590
You started it,
we just piled on.

81
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,560
What would I even say?

82
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,260
Zack, I'm sorry you're stupid.

83
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,530
Have a Milk Dud.

84
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,400
A Milk Dud?
Yeah,

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,830
Milk Duds,
with their self-deprecating name

86
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,540
and remarkably mild flavor,

87
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,510
are the most apologetic
of the boxed candies.

88
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,910
I got a better idea.

89
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,880
We're all responsible.

90
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,080
I say we all go.

91
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,280
Come on, who's with me?

92
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,390
Free comic books
to anyone who comes with me.

93
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,560
I might get punched.
You really want to miss that?

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,170
Junior Mints are
pretty apologetic.

95
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,330
You're embarrassing
yourself.

96
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,770
Penny.

97
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,410
What?
Yeah,

98
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,110
we came to talk to Zack.
Hey, Zack.

99
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,320
What do you want?

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,680
Listen,

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,780
the stuff
we were saying before--

102
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,350
we were just kidding around.

103
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,290
No, you weren't.

104
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,960
You were making fun
of me.

105
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,590
Come on, that's what we do.

106
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,690
We give each other a hard time.

107
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,890
Hey, Sheldon,

108
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,100
you look
like a praying mantis.

109
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:16,000
That's very hurtful.

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
See?

111
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,140
I don't know,
it still wasn't very nice.

112
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,640
Milk Dud?

113
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,410
Oh, I love Milk Duds.

114
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,080
Okay, we're cool.

115
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,750
Junior Mints.

116
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,320
You guys want to come in
and have a beer?

117
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Uh, we're on our way
to the comic book store.

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,820
Leonard's buying.

119
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,860
Really?

120
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,060
I haven't been
to a comic book store

121
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,630
in literally
a million years.

122
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,230
Literally?

123
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,560
Literally a
million years?

124
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,270
Don't.

125
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,530
You want to go with 'em?
No.

126
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,930
Okay, see you later.
Wait,

127
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,710
w-w-w-wait, you're ditching me
to go look at comic books?

128
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,910
Are you mad at me?

129
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm not happy.

130
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,710
Milk Dud?

131
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,450
Wow, this place
is awesome.

132
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,750
Where do they keep
the <i>Archies?</i>

133
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,120
In the bedrooms of ten-year-
old girls, where they belong.

134
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,010
Oh, no, you're thinking
old-school <i>Archie.</i>

135
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,830
It's much more
sophisticated now.

136
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,930
Like, there's
two universes,

137
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,870
and Archie's married
to Betty in one

138
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,930
and Veronica
in the other.

139
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,240
Midge is even breaking
up with Moose.

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,140
No.

141
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,840
About time, right?

142
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,340
Hey.

143
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,810
Hey.
You guys finally chip in
for a bodyguard?

144
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,880
Uh, no. Oh,
this is Zack.

145
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
He's a friend
of ours.

146
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,180
Zack, this is Stuart.

147
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,020
He owns
the store.

148
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,620
Wow, lucky you.

149
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,360
Yeah, I work
70 hours a week

150
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,230
and average
$1.65 an hour.

151
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,560
Sweet.

152
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,730
Is that sarcasm?

153
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,370
No, it's an indictment of the
American education system.

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,140
The <i>Archies</i> are over here.

155
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,090
Yippee.

156
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,610
So are you guys coming to
my New Year's Eve costume party?

157
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,880
Of course.

158
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,900
We're coming as the
Justice League of America.

159
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,010
Switching it up from last year

160
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,930
when we came as
the Justice League of America.

161
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,190
To that point,

162
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,960
it occurs to me that we
might have an opportunity

163
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,460
to finally snare
Best Group Costume

164
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,890
if we shore up
our weak link,

165
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,700
which is clearly
Leonard as Superman.

166
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,630
Hey, I got
new boots this year.

167
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,000
Guaranteed to add
three inches.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,870
That's sad.

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,970
Let's ask ourselves:

170
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,940
Is there anyone we know

171
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,480
who would make a more manly
and convincing son of Krypton?

172
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,780
Than Leonard
in high-heeled boots?

173
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,920
Howard's mother
in high-heeled boots?

174
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,990
I was thinking specifically
of the gentleman over there

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
moving his lips
as he enjoys

176
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,000
the latest exploits
of Betty and Veronica.

177
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,970
Zack?

178
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,610
He is the only person we know
with actual muscles.

179
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,710
You can't replace
me with Zack.

180
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,450
Why not?
Penny did it.

181
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,380
Yeah, she seems happier.

182
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,780
Why wouldn't we be?

183
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,180
Score.

184
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,150
I got an <i>Archie,
Betty and Veronica,</i>

185
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,450
and a <i>Jughead.</i>

186
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,620
All set
for my weekend number twos.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,660
Congratulations.

188
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,300
Zack, how would you
like to be Superman?

189
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,500
I don't know, sounds like
a lot of responsibility.

190
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,540
Fine, if Zack's going
to be Superman,

191
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,940
I want to be
Green Lantern.

192
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,910
But I'm Green Lantern.

193
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,330
You can be Aquaman.

194
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,660
I don't want to be Aquaman.

195
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,860
He sucks.

196
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,980
He sucks
underwater.

197
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,790
He sucks
fish pee.

198
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,960
Excuse me,

199
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,360
I believe Aquaman uses
his telepathic powers

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,660
to request the fish do
their business elsewhere.

201
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,270
Hey, babe.

202
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,350
I'm still mad at you.

203
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,330
Well, you won't be

204
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,440
when you hear the great news.

205
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,470
What great news?

206
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,070
We're going to
a costume party

207
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,610
at the comic book store
on New Year's Eve,

208
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,380
and you get to
be Wonder Woman.

209
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,880
Complete with bulletproof
bracelets and lasso of truth.

210
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,650
Invisible plane sold separately.

211
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,950
Wait, why me?

212
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,950
Wh-Why can't your girlfriend
be Wonder Woman?

213
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
She and her lab team
are under quarantine.

214
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,090
Seems at the Christmas party
they were doing Jell-O shots

215
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,160
out of petri dishes that used
to contain yellow fever.

216
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay, what about
your friend Amy?

217
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,300
Amy Farrah Fowler doesn't
believe in wearing costumes.

218
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,370
She isn't the free spirit I am.

219
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,040
Okay, well, forget it.

220
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,710
I'm not spending
my New Year's Eve

221
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,550
at a comic book store
wearing a Wonder Woman costume.

222
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,850
He says he'll wear it
if you'll be Aquaman.

223
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,990
What are you doing?

224
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,860
We're going
to be late.

225
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,480
I'm pacing nervously.

226
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,710
You're jogging.

227
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:30,050
This is how the
Flash paces.

228
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,720
Just chill out, Sheldon.

229
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,650
I'm not Sheldon.
I'm the Flash.

230
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,260
And now I'm going
to the Grand Canyon

231
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,560
to scream in frustration.

232
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,790
I'm back.

233
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,560
I'm Batman.

234
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,770
Oh, I hardly think so.

235
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,300
The real caped crusader calls
his crime-fighting cohorts

236
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,400
when he's running late.

237
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,810
I had to walk.

238
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,880
I couldn't get Raj
on the back of my scooter.

239
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,720
I've said this before,
and I'll say it again.

240
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,890
Aquaman sucks.

241
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,460
Look up in the sky.
It's a bird. It's a plane.

242
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,060
I forget the rest.

243
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,030
All right. Let's get
this thing over with.

244
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,740
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,570
But in what universe
is Wonder Woman blonde?

246
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,540
Relax. No one's going to
be looking at her hair.

247
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,750
Ow!

248
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
I mean,

249
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,750
ow.

250
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,950
Hold on. The costume came

251
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,090
with a black wig.
Where is it, babe?

252
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,120
No. I'm not wearing
it. It looks stupid.

253
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,720
Come on. We're trying
to win a contest here.

254
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,990
Forget it. I'm not
wearing the wig.

255
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,130
Honey, there's no "I"
in "Justice League."

256
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,650
Well, actually...

257
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,170
Don't.
He's making our case.

258
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:01,040
Okay, babe. Uh...

259
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,210
Kind of embarrassing me
in front of my friends.

260
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,940
Okay.
You know what?

261
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,950
I changed my mind.
I'm not going.

262
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,630
Looks like someone
else is going

263
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,050
to have to be Wonder Woman.

264
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,090
Babe, open up.

265
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm not talking to you.

266
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,830
Then who are you talking to?

267
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,800
Babe?

268
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,670
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny,

269
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,470
Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,

270
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,840
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny

271
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Penny, Penny...

272
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,000
What the hell
is wrong with you?

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,180
I'm the Flash.

274
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,880
I just knocked 30,000 times.

275
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,030
Okay. What do you
want, Sheldon?

276
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,850
I understand
why you're upset.

277
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,250
Really?

278
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,620
Yes.

279
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,930
You're afraid that costume
makes you look fat.

280
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,260
No.

281
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,430
Wh-What...

282
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,470
Does it?

283
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,830
Don't worry.

284
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,370
Wonder Woman
was an Amazon.

285
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,070
And Amazons tend to
be very beefy gals.

286
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,030
Good-bye, Sheldon.

287
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,180
But they're not blonde,
so put on your wig.

288
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,350
Hello?

289
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,470
Stupid Aquaman.

290
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,600
If it makes you
feel any better,

291
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,840
when I was dating Penny,

292
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,410
she used to flip out
on me all the time.

293
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,640
Whoa. You dated Penny?

294
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,010
She didn't tell you?

295
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,250
She told me she dated
a guy named Leonard.

296
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,380
Who would have
thought it was you?

297
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,050
Who else would it be?

298
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,860
I don't know. Somebody
bigger and...

299
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,460
Yeah, sure.
Why not you?

300
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,400
I may have failed.

301
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay, I guess we just go
without a Wonder Woman.

302
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,370
I don't want to go
without Penny.

303
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,070
Oh, great. No Superman,
no Wonder Woman?

304
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,510
All we've got is a skinny Flash,

305
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,940
an Indian Aquaman,

306
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,950
a nearsighted
Green Lantern,

307
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,180
and a teeny, tiny
Dark Knight.

308
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,690
Obviously, we're no longer
a Justice League.

309
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,920
We have no choice but to switch
to our Muppet Baby costumes.

310
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,730
Ooh, I call Kermit.

311
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,760
I'm Kermit.
You're Scooter.

312
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,170
Oh, man.
Scooter sucks.

313
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,970
He's the Aquaman
of the Muppet Babies.

314
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,710
No, we can still
make this work.

315
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,280
Leonard,
you talk to Penny.

316
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
What makes you think
I can convince her?

317
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,110
You got her
to have sex with you.

318
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,170
Obviously, your superpower
is brainwashing.

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,050
Okay, let me see
if I understand this.

320
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,290
You want me
to convince my ex-girlfriend

321
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,060
to go to a costume party
with her new boyfriend

322
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,130
just so we can win
a stupid prize?

323
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,900
Yes. And make her wear
the black wig. Good luck.

324
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,770
Go away, Sheldon.

325
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,070
It's Leonard.

326
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,400
Oh.

327
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,660
Go away, Leonard.

328
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,880
Come on, let me
just talk to you.

329
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,080
It's open.

330
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,880
Hey.

331
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,650
I'm not going
to that party, Leonard.

332
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,120
Okay, listen.
You don't have to wear the wig.

333
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
At this party,
we're gonna win first prize

334
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,220
just by showing up with a girl.

335
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,320
It's not the wig.

336
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,090
Did I do something?

337
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,790
I mean, I tried to be
friends with Zack,

338
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,300
like you said, which believe me,
was difficult,

339
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,670
given how you and me
used to be...

340
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,270
you know, "you and
me," and now you

341
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,770
and him are
"you and him."

342
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,910
Okay, look.
We're not really "me and him."

343
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,540
Then what are you?

344
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,510
I don't know.

345
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,750
I only started seeing Zack again

346
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,780
so I wouldn't be alone
on New Year's Eve.

347
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,020
How pathetic is that?

348
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,550
Not as pathetic
as dressing up like this

349
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,620
and going to a comic book store
on New Year's Eve.

350
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,290
You make a cute Green Arrow.

351
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,370
Green Lantern.

352
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,470
Like there's a difference.

353
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,440
There's a big difference.

354
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,470
Arrow.

355
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,570
Lantern.

356
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,280
Whatever. Look,
if Zack and I had just gone

357
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,710
to a regular club or a party,
it would have been fine,

358
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
but this, with the costumes,
and you...

359
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,150
What about me?

360
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,690
Nothing.

361
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,780
Let's go to the party.

362
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,730
How do I look?

363
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,640
Um...

364
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,070
I guarantee you'll be
the prettiest girl there.

365
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,480
Okay, the good news is,
we have a Wonder Woman.

366
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,590
Oh.
Yes.

367
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,710
What's the bad news?

368
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,050
Superman probably isn't

369
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,910
getting laid tonight.

370
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,770
Aw, damn.

371
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,020
And the award

372
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,520
for best group costume
goes to...

373
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,530
Justice League of America...

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Number three!

375
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,670
Thank you!
Thank you so much!

376
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,540
Okay. Okay, ten
seconds to midnight.

377
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,680
Ten, nine, eight...

378
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,130
No, wait!

379
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,480
I have a speech.

380
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,050
Seven, six...
Stop counting!

381
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,790
Five, four, three...
This is my moment, dag nab it!

382
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,090
Two, one!

383
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,140
Happy New Year!

384
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,470
I'm not going
to say another word

385
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,840
until you people settle down.

386
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,810
I'm waiting.

387
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,080
That was a
great party.

388
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,670
We should dress like
this all the time.

389
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,510
Are you high?

390
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,620
You're being
a bully.

391
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,800
Check it out.

392
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,330
Those guys are breaking
into that car.

393
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,370
What should we do?

394
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,100
We're the Justice League
of America.

395
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,800
There's only one thing
we can do.

396
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,240
Turn around
and slowly walk away.

397
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,400
Nah.

398
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,570
Hold up.

399
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,540
Look, I know our winter
thermostat setting

400
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,290
is 72 degrees,
but I'm a little warm,

401
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,830
so I'm going
to turn it down.

402
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Good Lord,

403
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,490
how you frustrate me,
Leonard Hofstadter!

404
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,310
Fine.

405
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,310

406
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:02,310
