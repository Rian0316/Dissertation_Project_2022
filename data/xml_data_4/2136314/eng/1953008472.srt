1
00:00:02,545 --> 00:00:04,643
Completely empty box.

2
00:00:04,644 --> 00:00:05,915
If you'd like to examine it...

3
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,254
Mm-hmm. Yep.

4
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:11,354
I see nothing in this box
but a wasted childhood.

5
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:14,651
Little snarky there,
Cello Lessons.

6
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:20,342
And we have this completely
ordinary cylinder.

7
00:00:20,344 --> 00:00:21,731
If you'd like to examine it...

8
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:27,036
Ordinary, yet I sense it is
dripping with magical potential.

9
00:00:27,038 --> 00:00:29,581
Oh, dear Lord.

10
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,062
A man pops out for a moment
to evacuate his bowels

11
00:00:33,064 --> 00:00:36,108
and catch up on the adventures
of the Caped Crusader,

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,100
only to emerge
and discover his apartment

13
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:40,895
has been transformed
into a cabaret.

14
00:00:40,897 --> 00:00:42,921
Sheldon, he's just

15
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,861
practicing for his
cousin's birthday party.

16
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:46,703
As I was saying...

17
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:48,628
empty box, empty cylinder,

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,436
and... ooh!

19
00:00:50,438 --> 00:00:52,528
(whispers): Voila.

20
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,485
I'm telling you, dude,
there's a seat

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,833
on the Hogwarts Express
with your name on it.

22
00:00:57,835 --> 00:00:59,557
This is how you're
going to entertain

23
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,213
your little cousin
and his friends?

24
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:02,487
By lying to them?

25
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,528
(chuckles): How is this lying?

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,122
A magic show is an inherently
deceitful proposition.

27
00:01:07,124 --> 00:01:10,185
"This is an ordinary top hat."

28
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:11,524
"You've chosen
that card freely."

29
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:15,542
"I do not have a set of lock
picks lodged in my keister."

30
00:01:15,544 --> 00:01:16,880
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Can't you

31
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:18,135
just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon?

32
00:01:18,137 --> 00:01:19,792
Why must you
peek behind the curtain?

33
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:21,632
Or up the butt?

34
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:24,813
If we poison the critical
thinking faculties of children

35
00:01:24,815 --> 00:01:26,336
by telling them that rabbits

36
00:01:26,338 --> 00:01:29,516
come out of hats,
then we create adults

37
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:31,642
who believe in astrology
and homeopathy

38
00:01:31,644 --> 00:01:34,989
and that Ryan Reynolds was a
better choice for <i>Green Lantern</i>

39
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:37,500
than lovable rogue
Nathan Fillion.

40
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,508
Sheldon,

41
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,952
he's just gonna do a few
magic tricks for some kids.

42
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:43,558
I really don't think
they're gonna end up

43
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,087
liking the <i>Green Lantern</i> movie.

44
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,542
Don't be so
hard on him.

45
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:49,467
It's natural to be
a little cranky when you have...

46
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:52,864
(grunts): a quarter
in your ear!

47
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,802
Coins lodged in body parts
is not a source of amusement.

48
00:01:57,804 --> 00:02:01,902
When I was five, Billy Sparks
put a Mexican peso up my nose.

49
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,108
(laughter)

50
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,903
Wait-wait-wait,
how is that not amusing?

51
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:07,744
It's still there.

52
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:09,836
Takes me

53
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:12,949
45 minutes to get
through airport security.

54
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:18,723
Look, I made
Sheldon disappear. Ta-da.

55
00:02:18,725 --> 00:02:22,189

open with that.

Original Air Date on January 12, 2012

65
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:48,268

66
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,228
Ooh, look who's out on a date.

67
00:02:50,229 --> 00:02:54,010
Pasadena's favorite
power couple, Shamy.

68
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,103
And that is the answer
to the question,

69
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,746
what is wrong with eating
at The Cheesecake Factory?

70
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,609
So, are we celebrating
anything special tonight?

71
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,831
Oh, yes.

72
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:04,621
Our relationship
agreement specifies

73
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:06,430
that the second Thursday
of every month,

74
00:03:06,432 --> 00:03:08,991
or the third Thursday
in a month with five Thursdays,

75
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:10,530
is date night.

76
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,857
That is so hot.

77
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:22,581
All right, without objection,
the minutes of the previous date

78
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,974
are considered
read and agreed to.

79
00:03:25,896 --> 00:03:27,736
Any new business?

80
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:29,326
How was your day?

81
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,246
Superb.

82
00:03:30,248 --> 00:03:32,757
This morning I made
a palindrome

83
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,979
with my Alpha-Bits.

84
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:37,058
"Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."

85
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,774
Sounds like you
hit the ground running.

86
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:43,553
I have a bit of
good news myself.

87
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,991
My most recent paper

88
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:47,485
on how a cooperative
long-term potentiation

89
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:49,528
can map memory sequences
in dendritic branches

90
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,787
made the cover of <i>Neuron.</i>

91
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,996
Ooh! Speaking of good news,

92
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:55,185
somebody...

93
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:58,314
just hit 100
Twitter followers.

94
00:03:58,316 --> 00:04:00,540
That's nice.

95
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:02,163
Anyway, I've been
dreaming of this day

96
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:03,754
for a long time.
Yeah, me, too.

97
00:04:03,756 --> 00:04:05,645
Triple digits,
I'm not gonna lie--

98
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:07,184
it feels pretty good.

99
00:04:07,186 --> 00:04:08,891
Sheldon,

100
00:04:08,893 --> 00:04:11,085
I'm the sole author
on a paper being published

101
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,876
in a distinguished journal
that may change

102
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,214
the course of my field.

103
00:04:14,216 --> 00:04:15,369
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,143
Ooh, 101!

105
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:20,240
Air's getting
a bit thin up here.

106
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:23,637
So, are we ready to order?

107
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,892
Give me a minute.

108
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,667
I'm gonna go wash up.

109
00:04:28,073 --> 00:04:30,031
Well, that's odd.

110
00:04:30,033 --> 00:04:32,508
We both washed up
when we came in.

111
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:35,335
It's probably a euphemism
for urination.

112
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:37,696
Sheldon, what is
wrong with you?

113
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,877
Not much. Although,
I can be faulted

114
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,203
for being overly fond
of koala bears.

115
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:44,810
I don't know what it is,

116
00:04:44,812 --> 00:04:46,769
when they smart munching
on eucalyptus,

117
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,162
I just melt inside.

118
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:51,069
Okay, Amy just told you
some exciting news,

119
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,296
and you acted like
it was no big deal.

120
00:04:53,298 --> 00:04:55,053
Oh, I see why you're confused.

121
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:57,931
No, her news sounded important,
but what you're forgetting is,

122
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,710
it was an achievement
in the field of biology.

123
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:04,827
That's all about yucky,
squishy things.

124
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,322
Honey, she's upset.
You're her boyfriend.

125
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:09,815
You have to at least
try to be excited

126
00:05:09,817 --> 00:05:11,589
by the things
she's excited by.

127
00:05:11,591 --> 00:05:14,149
What if they simply
don't excite me?

128
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:17,447
Well, just smile and
think about koalas.

129
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,786
She'd see right through that.

130
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,861
We go to the zoo all the time.

131
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,719
She knows my koala face.

132
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,820
And for future reference,
it's this.

133
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,548
Oh, you have a lot
of magic stuff.

134
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,021
Yeah.

135
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:36,594
I started when I was a teenager.

136
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,954
I thought I could show
a girl a few tricks

137
00:05:38,956 --> 00:05:42,502
and invite her up to my bedroom
to see the rest of the act.

138
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,230
Did it work?

139
00:05:45,232 --> 00:05:47,440
Ah, let's just say the only wand

140
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:51,340
that ever saw any action
was this one.

141
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:57,098
Oh, look what my mom
made us for the act.

142
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,369
Ooh...

143
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,294
I like the fabric.

144
00:06:00,296 --> 00:06:01,666
Where'd she get it?

145
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:05,566
Well, she cut up one
of her old bathing suits.

146
00:06:06,722 --> 00:06:10,588
She made these two vests
and half a dozen napkins.

147
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:15,256
MRS. WOLOWITZ (calls): Has she
tried on the vest yet?!

148
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:16,261
I just gave it to her!

149
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:19,626
I hope it fits-- she
has a tricky figure!

150
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:24,429
She's short
and stacked, like me!

151
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:28,446
She's not stacked like you, Ma!
She never steps on hers!

152
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,940
Listen, Howie,
maybe I'm not the best choice

153
00:06:34,942 --> 00:06:36,563
to be a magician's assistant.

154
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:38,873
You'll do fine.
Hand me those rings?

155
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:42,706
See? You nailed it.

156
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,011
You know, i-it's just that

157
00:06:44,013 --> 00:06:45,936
I'm not that comfortable
with little kids.

158
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,028
Well, that's because you
haven't been around them much.

159
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,786
This is good
practice. I mean,

160
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:52,513
you are gonna be
a mom someday, right?

161
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,602
Mmm...

162
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,927
Yeah, sure.
Oh-ho-ho!

163
00:06:55,929 --> 00:07:00,615
I haven't seen
this trick in years.

164
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:02,137
It's called
the dove pan.

165
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,481
You let everyone see
the pan is empty,

166
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:08,112
but there's a secret
compartment in the lid.

167
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:11,711
And then you open it
and produce a live...

168
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:24,565
Don't look in there.

169
00:07:28,784 --> 00:07:31,410
Oh, a little Red
Dead Redemption, huh?

170
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:33,687
SHELDON:
Yes.

171
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:35,193
How come you're not
doing a mission?

172
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,366
You're just
wandering around.

173
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,123
Had a rough night.

174
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,804
I thought I'd go for a walk
and clear my head.

175
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:47,277
Some people go outside
and do that.

176
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,843
It's after 9:00-- at this hour
the streets of Pasadena

177
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,943
are teeming with drunken sailors
and alley cats.

178
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:56,784
You want to talk about it?

179
00:07:56,786 --> 00:07:57,905
No.

180
00:07:57,907 --> 00:08:00,099
I think I'll just go
in this saloon

181
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:02,708
and drink my troubles away.

182
00:08:07,497 --> 00:08:11,747
You know digital
alcohol is never a solution.

183
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:13,856
What's going on?

184
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,195
(sighs)

185
00:08:15,197 --> 00:08:17,288
Hard as this may be to believe,

186
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,304
it's possible that
I'm not boyfriend material.

187
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:28,149
Glad I was sitting down
for that.

188
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:30,175
Did you and Amy get in a fight?

189
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:34,175
Amy had a fight; I was being
perfectly reasonable.

190
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,233
I'm gonna have a whiskey.

191
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:37,321
Do you want anything?

192
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:39,648
No, I can't.

193
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,543
I'm playing Grand
Theft Auto later.

194
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:50,092
Look, I'm no expert in women...

195
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:50,962
I'll say.

196
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,113
That's not necessary when
someone's trying to help you.

197
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,373
I'm sorry.
It's the alcohol talking.

198
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,682
Go on.

199
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:05,306
Sometimes with women you want
to listen to what upsets them

200
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:10,461
and then show them
that you can grow and change.

201
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:16,854
Nuts to that.
What else you got?

202
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,076
Buy her something.

203
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,809
How does that work?

204
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,608
Well, you skip over
any attempt to repair

205
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,671
your emotional connection
and you win back her affection

206
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:32,252
with an empty financial gesture.

207
00:09:32,254 --> 00:09:37,090
Well, that approach has Sheldon
Cooper written all over it.

208
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,119
Glad I could help.

209
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,792
It's appreciated.
And if you ever manage

210
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:44,856
to find a woman again, I'll
be glad to return the favor.

211
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,881
And now, all
the rings are

212
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,274
magically linked together.

213
00:09:54,547 --> 00:09:58,128
My fiancée's wearing
a magic ring, too.

214
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,656
It made all my money disappear.

215
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,559
Oh, ah, right.

216
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:11,417
And now, the
great Howdini's

217
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:14,948
next miraculous
illusion.

218
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,957
When are we gonna have cake?

219
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,095
After you've
been thoroughly amazed.

220
00:10:22,097 --> 00:10:24,272
But we want cake now.

221
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:27,753
Well, you're not getting cake
right now, <i>capisce?</i>

222
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:32,974
(chuckles):
Okay. Okay.

223
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:36,741
Now, my lovely assistant
is going to bring me

224
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:38,749
an ordinary
pitcher of milk.

225
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,557
I know how you do that trick.

226
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:42,515
Do you know how to pipe down?

227
00:10:43,654 --> 00:10:45,913
(chuckles):
Okay, we're going

228
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:49,176
to roll up
this newspaper.

229
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:50,432
It's a fake pitcher.

230
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,105
You got wax in your ears?

231
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:54,733
The man said
it's an ordinary pitcher.

232
00:10:55,403 --> 00:10:57,612
Howdini.

233
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:02,649
Okay, we're going
to stick this in here.

234
00:11:02,651 --> 00:11:05,478
And then I'm going
to pour in the milk.

235
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,621
(chuckles):
I hope this works,

236
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,696
because I didn't
bring a change of pants.

237
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,273
Look, I Googled it.

238
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:14,382
It's a fake pitcher.

239
00:11:15,621 --> 00:11:17,462
That's it.

240
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:18,750
No cake for you.

241
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:21,345
Anyone else want to
join the No Cake Club?

242
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:24,575
She's just kidding,
boys and girls.

243
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:25,947
Everyone gets cake.

244
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,927
Not him.

245
00:11:30,635 --> 00:11:33,864
Just give me the pitcher.

246
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:35,320
(clears throat)

247
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:37,497
Behold!

248
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:45,195
(laughter)

249
00:11:49,966 --> 00:11:52,174
Wrong pitcher.

250
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:59,787
I told you I'm not
good with kids.

251
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:01,259
Yes, you did.

252
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:04,523
Oh, I think my crotch
is starting to curdle.

253
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:08,841
The thing is, my mother
worked full-time.

254
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:11,469
I had to take care of
my brothers and sisters.

255
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,143
Yeah, so?

256
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:14,733
Ugh, it was horrible!

257
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:17,378
With their snotty noses
and their poopy diapers

258
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,005
and their little shrieky voices,
always complaining.

259
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,478
"I don't want to get dressed."

260
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,218
"Joey keeps spitting
in my mouth."

261
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,244
"This isn't the way
Mom makes waffles."

262
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,336
(yelling): Well, okay, put your
hand in here.

263
00:12:27,338 --> 00:12:29,912
Let's see how you
like this waffle!

264
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:33,093
All right, settle down.

265
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:34,315
Red light.

266
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,273
Red light, red light!

267
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:39,587
Okay, we're fine.

268
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:41,010
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,185
I know it makes me sound
like a bad person,

270
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,776
but I just don't like children.

271
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,952
Yeah, no, we all got that.

272
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:51,136
But don't you think
it'll be different

273
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:53,530
when the child is ours?

274
00:12:53,532 --> 00:12:56,073
Right, when it's our kid
that's ruined my body

275
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,035
and kept me up all night and
I've got no career and no future

276
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:01,396
and nothing to be happy about
for the next 20 years,

277
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:04,274
sure, that'll be
completely different.

278
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:09,379
Well, yeah.

279
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:17,364
I don't think there's
anything in this jewelry store

280
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,785
that Amy would appreciate more

281
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:22,350
than the humidifier we were
just looking at at Sears.

282
00:13:22,352 --> 00:13:25,313
Oh, my God, now I know
what I sound like to you

283
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:28,025
when I say stupid stuff.

284
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:31,857
Ooh, a pocket watch.

285
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:33,849
Okay, I don't think Amy
wants a pocket watch.

286
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:37,749
No, but maybe she wants
a man with a pocket watch.

287
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,849
Still saying stupid stuff.

288
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:43,774
Ooh...

289
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:44,829
Does she like bracelets?

290
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,122
Well, she's very fond
of her silver one

291
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,046
that says "allergic
to penicillin."

292
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:52,444
Maybe they have a dressier
version of that?

293
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,402
Well, how are we doing
this afternoon?

294
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,875
Are we looking for
anything special?

295
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,331
Perhaps a ring for the lady?

296
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:59,641
(snorts) Trust me, we are
not a couple.

297
00:13:59,643 --> 00:14:01,565
Excuse me.

298
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:04,578
I don't see why you get to snort
derisively and point that out.

299
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,423
You'd be lucky to land
a fella like me.

300
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:08,880
Fine, go ahead.

301
00:14:08,882 --> 00:14:12,646
(snorts) Trust me, we are
not a couple.

302
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:13,701
My apologies.

303
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,374
How can I help you today?

304
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,746
He's in trouble
with his girlfriend

305
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,303
and needs to
buy her a present.

306
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:20,898
Great, trouble with girlfriends

307
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,161
is what's putting
my daughter through USC.

308
00:14:26,203 --> 00:14:28,679
Ooh, are these real diamonds?

309
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:32,194
Yes. Channel set baguettes,
20 points total weight.

310
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:33,785
Remarkable.

311
00:14:33,787 --> 00:14:36,161
Diamonds, crystallized carbon.

312
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:38,286
Every day, people go
to the grocery store

313
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:40,345
and come home with
sacks full of carbon

314
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,135
in the form of
charcoal briquettes

315
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:44,747
that they toss in their
barbeques and set on fire.

316
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:47,174
But just because
you've got some carbon

317
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,182
with the atoms stacked neatly,

318
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:51,861
you expect me to plunk down
thousands of dollars.

319
00:14:51,863 --> 00:14:53,483
Actually, that's only 750.

320
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,739
Everything's on sale.

321
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:57,952
Really. Talk to me
about that pocket watch.

322
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,442
I'm still trying to
wrap my mind around it.

323
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,731
I always

324
00:15:04,733 --> 00:15:07,627
thought I'd be a dad someday.

325
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:08,915
Oh, me, too.

326
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,355
You're so caring.

327
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:13,904
I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.

328
00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:19,343
There you go, Howard.

329
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,656
Sounds like Raj'll have
your babies; problem solved.

330
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:24,783
Hey, just because a man
shows caring for another man

331
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,087
doesn't mean he's
displaying the love

332
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,100
that dare not speak its name.

333
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,183
Did she definitely say
she didn't want kids?

334
00:15:33,185 --> 00:15:34,992
Yeah, she doesn't like them.

335
00:15:34,994 --> 00:15:38,339
And from what I saw,
the feeling was mutual.

336
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,234
What are you gonna do?

337
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,473
I don't know.

338
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:49,084
I can't see a life
where I don't have kids.

339
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:50,642
I mean, people have kids.

340
00:15:50,644 --> 00:15:55,779
I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.

341
00:15:55,781 --> 00:16:00,097
So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses

342
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:04,048
and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.

343
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,662
You know, there's no guarantee
even if you have kids

344
00:16:07,664 --> 00:16:09,353
that you're going to like them.

345
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:12,483
Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?

346
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:16,801
It's right off the dust jacket
of my mom's last book.

347
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:23,328
Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.

348
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:27,546
Look, Howard, I'd say there's
a lot of fish in the sea,

349
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:30,525
but I watched you dangle your
hook in the water for years.

350
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:33,170
Do not throw her back.

351
00:16:35,748 --> 00:16:39,898
I don't want to, but this is
kind of a deal breaker.

352
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,074
What's your mom going to say
if you call off the wedding?

353
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,413
Oh, it'll kill her.

354
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,371
On the other hand, if I don't
give her grandchildren,

355
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,793
that'll kill her, too.

356
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:49,522
So, either way,
on the Mom front, I'm golden.

357
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:54,660
What time did you tell
Amy to be here?

358
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,585
8:00.

359
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:03,865
Sheldon, that pocket watch
is ridiculous.

360
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,071
Nonsense.

361
00:17:05,073 --> 00:17:07,783
I look like a train conductor.

362
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,820
Under what pretext
did you lure her here?

363
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:16,000
(knocking) I said, "Hey, want
to come over and hang out?"

364
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,975
Good, good, if you had
said something clever,

365
00:17:17,977 --> 00:17:20,184
she might've gotten suspicious.

366
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:23,414
Hey.
Hi.

367
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,653
What's he doing here?

368
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,344
Okay, he wants
to talk to you.

369
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,102
Well, I don't want
to talk to him.

370
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,176
And I'm pretty
disappointed in you, too.

371
00:17:30,178 --> 00:17:33,791
Although we both
know that won't last.

372
00:17:33,793 --> 00:17:36,469
Sheldon, you're up.

373
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,474
Thank you.

374
00:17:37,476 --> 00:17:40,486
Amy, I'd like to apologize.

375
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:42,830
Your accomplishment
was impressive.

376
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:46,010
And I'm proud of you.

377
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,562
We both know that's
your koala face.

378
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:51,818
I told you.

379
00:17:53,241 --> 00:17:55,416
Okay, look, he
bought you this.

380
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:57,893
Jewelry?

381
00:17:57,895 --> 00:17:59,299
Seriously?

382
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:01,191
Sheldon, you are
the most shallow,

383
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:03,082
self-centered person
I have ever met.

384
00:18:03,084 --> 00:18:05,492
Do you really think another
transparently manipul...

385
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,332
Oh, it's a tiara!

386
00:18:07,334 --> 00:18:09,006
A tiara!
I have a tiara!

387
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,517
Put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me, put it on me,

388
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,798
put it on me, put it
on me, put it on me.

389
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:19,099
You look beautiful.

390
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:21,191
Of course I do, I'm a princess,
and this is my tiara!

391
00:18:31,117 --> 00:18:33,794
You were right,
the tiara was too much.

392
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:42,529
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard! Bernadette's...

393
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,378
Oh, she slipped
right by me.

394
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,935
Here's your vest back.

395
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:49,324
You should keep it.

396
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:51,199
You could wear it
again sometime.

397
00:18:51,201 --> 00:18:52,453
Where?

398
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:55,969
I don't know, hunting?

399
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,976
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Don't forget to talk to

400
00:18:58,002 --> 00:18:59,305
her about this <i>mishegas</i>

401
00:18:59,402 --> 00:19:01,492
where I don't
get grandkids!

402
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,304
Don't worry, Ma.

403
00:19:04,306 --> 00:19:06,396
I will, as soon
as I can figure out a way

404
00:19:06,398 --> 00:19:09,107
to bring up
such a sensitive issue!

405
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:15,016
I guess you talked
to your mom, huh?

406
00:19:15,018 --> 00:19:16,504
I was upset.

407
00:19:16,506 --> 00:19:19,016
My mom can be a pretty
good shoulder to cry on,

408
00:19:19,018 --> 00:19:22,832
if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.

409
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,731
Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you,

410
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:29,610
and I think I came up
with a solution.

411
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:31,150
(laughing):
Really?

412
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:32,673
That's great. What?

413
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:36,690
Well, seeing as how I make way
more money than you anyway,

414
00:19:36,692 --> 00:19:39,619
what if I work and you
stay home with the kids?

415
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:41,945
Me?
Yeah.

416
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:43,886
You know, you'll watch <i>Barney</i>

417
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,728
and pull Cheerios
out of their noses

418
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,300
and go on play dates,

419
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:49,075
and I'll work and
have conversations

420
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:52,724
with people my own age
and enjoy my life.

421
00:19:55,437 --> 00:19:56,775
Yeah...

422
00:19:56,777 --> 00:19:59,736
Yay, so we're good.

423
00:19:59,738 --> 00:20:03,084
Yeah, we're good.

424
00:20:03,086 --> 00:20:06,348
You know, I don't know if
this counted as a fight,

425
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,160
but how about
some make-up sex?

426
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:10,499
I would love that.

427
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:13,511
But what is that
behind your ear?

428
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,252
Oh, look, it's a condom.

429
00:20:15,254 --> 00:20:19,267
