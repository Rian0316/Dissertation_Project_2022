1
00:00:08,406 --> 00:00:09,572
你怎么没睡?
Why are you up?

2
00:00:09,574 --> 00:00:10,957
我怎么睡得着?
How am I supposed to sleep?

3
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:12,875
我才刚结婚不到24小时
I've been married less than 24 hours,

4
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:14,477
我老婆就不跟我说话了
and my wife isn't speaking to me.

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,965
也许你应该想想这事儿好的一面
Perhaps you can think of this in a more positive light.

6
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,170
你花了一天就体验完了
In one day, you've managed to do

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,735
其他夫妇花几十年才完成的事情
what it takes many couples decades to achieve.

8
00:00:27,523 --> 00:00:28,092
嗨
Hi.

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:29,260
嘿
Hey.

10
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,094
你也睡不着吗?
You couldn't sleep either?

11
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,396
当然睡不着
Of course not.

12
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:33,597
我也是
Me neither.

13
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:37,068
但我只是喉咙有点痒
But I just had a tickle in my throat.

14
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,487
不是因为严重的婚姻问题
Not profound marital problems.

15
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:41,272
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

16
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:42,573
我不知道
I don't know.

17
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:44,742
请告诉我该怎么解决
Please, tell me how I can fix it.

18
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,828
幸亏你问了
Glad you asked.

19
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,331
在我看来 有个很简单的解决办法
As I see it, there's a simple solution.

20
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,501
你的嘴唇调戏过别的女人的嘴唇
Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman.

21
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,453
要想恢复你们关系的平衡
It seems only logical that

22
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,121
你应该另找个男人
to restore balance to the relationship,

23
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,174
调戏一下 这样才合乎逻辑
you should find another man and dally with him.

24
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,510
我说的"调戏"是指激烈的
And by dally, I mean some hardcore

25
00:01:02,512 --> 00:01:04,345
嘴对嘴运动
mouth-on-mouth action.

26
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:07,298
好吧 那是我听过最蠢的主意
Okay, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,467
其实 我觉得他说对了
Actually, I think he's onto something.

28
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,369
你... 在开玩笑吧
Y... You can't be serious.

29
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,271
因为我以前鬼混 和一个妹子亲了嘴
'Cause I messed up and made out with a girl,

30
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:16,674
你就要随便找个汉子也亲一口?
you're gonna do the same with a random guy?

31
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,176
我目前单身
I'm currently single.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,513
没错 你的确单身
That's true. You are.

33
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,751
搞什么呢?!
What is happening?!

34
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,954
我来告诉你这是搞什么
I will tell you what is happening.

35
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:32,022
我在挽救最好朋友的婚姻

唯一能让我理清情绪的方式
The only way I can sort through my feelings

50
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:22,119
就是我俩保持距离
is if there is space between us.

51
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,055
我每次看到你 又会再受一次伤

又得重复经历同样的痛苦

我也向你问好
Well, hello to you, too.

00:02:30,396 --> 00:02:32,195
你想怎样?
What do you want?

55

我明白我们已经不是情侣
I understand we're no longer a couple,

56
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:37,701
但我想提醒你 我们一起造过小孩
but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together.

57
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,888
什么小孩?
What baby?

58
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,825
一个早熟的网络小节目

59

00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:49,963
我要挂了
I'm hanging up.

61
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:52,065
好 我们半小时后见

00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:55,619
Sheldon 我不会和你一起主持"旗乐无穷"的
Sheldon, I am not doing "Fun With Flags" with you.

63
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,820
为什么?
Why not?

64
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:58,755
因为我们分手了
Because we're broken up.

65
00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,724
桑尼和雪儿就行
Sonny and Cher made it work.

00:02:58,757 --> 00:03:00,724
{\an8}美国著名夫妻档歌手 后离婚

67
00:03:00,726 --> 00:03:02,559
他们离婚很久之后
Their variety show kept going

68
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:03,677
还是继续同台演出
long after the divorce,

69
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,346
我们至今还在谈论他们
and here we are still talking about them.

70
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:09,566
没人会说起桑尼和雪儿
No one's talking about Sonny and Cher.

71
00:03:09,568 --> 00:03:11,635
你肯定是错想成了唐尼和玛丽那对
You must be thinking about Donny and Marie,

72
00:03:11,637 --> 00:03:14,021
但我们在说的绝对是桑尼和雪儿
'cause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher.

73
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,374
Sheldon 不能这么下去了
Sheldon, this has to stop.

74
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,942
我知道这很难
I know it's hard.

75
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,711
对我来说也是
It's hard for me, too.

76
00:03:20,713 --> 00:03:22,579
但我们分手后这两天
But I've seen and talked to you more

77
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:24,114
我们见面和交谈的次数
in the two days we've been broken up

78
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,783
比分手前两个月的都要多
than in the last two months that we were together.

79
00:03:26,785 --> 00:03:28,418
好吧 如果你想少看到我
Well, if you want to see less of me,

80
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,121
也许我们应该在一起
maybe we should go out again.

81
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,624
真是难以置信 你和Mandy Chao亲嘴了
I can't believe you made out with Mandy Chao.

82
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,626
相信我 我希望我没那么干
Trust me, I wish it never happened.

83
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:39,012
你一直就知道这件事?
And you knew about this this whole time?

84
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:40,213
对
I did.

85
00:03:40,215 --> 00:03:42,132
你还没想着告诉我?
And you didn't think to tell me?

86
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:46,219
Leonard让我不要说出去的
Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.

87
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:48,405
我们暂时先不要提Leonard
Let's leave Leonard out of this for the moment.

88
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:52,192
这是我们之间的事
This is about you and me.

89
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:56,363
等等 等等 我和老婆的新婚危机
Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart

90
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:57,481
怎么就成你俩的事了?
becoming about you two?

91
00:03:57,483 --> 00:03:58,648
等等
Hang on.

92
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,451
我该做什么才能赢得你的信任?
What do I need to do to make you trust me?

93
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,303
你觉得有一个老婆日子就艰难了
You think it's hard having one wife,

94
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:04,671
试试看两个
try having two.

95
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:07,324
我打赌你肯定告诉Bernadette
I bet you told Bernadette

96
00:04:07,326 --> 00:04:10,110
他和Mandy Chao各种厮混的事情了
all about he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.

97
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,328
我们没有厮混
Oh, we didn't screw around.

98
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:12,829
我们只是喝醉了 亲了个嘴
We just got drunk and made out.

99
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,482
随便了 要是你告诉我 我会舒服很多
Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.

100
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:31,681
你来这做什么?
What are you doing here?

101
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:34,184
我是来把东西还给你的
I'm here to return your belongings.

102
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,153
大家分手后都会这么做
That's what people who've broken up do.

103
00:04:36,155 --> 00:04:39,322
而且你还没用惯用的敲门方式
And you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual

104
00:04:39,324 --> 00:04:40,857
所以我才会开门
so I would open the door.

105
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:42,359
反而言之
On the contrary,

106
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:45,612
你再也没法享受我那魅力十足的怪癖
you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities.

107
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,616
我们不是有福利的朋友
We're not friends with benefits.

108
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:52,586
把盒子给我
Just give me the box.

109
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:54,504
等... 等等 难道你不想翻看一下
W... Wait. Don't you want to go through it

110
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:56,206
确保我没把什么东西落下吗?
to make sure I haven't forgotten anything?

111
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,291
行吧
Fine.

112
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:01,378
我的旧围巾
My old scarf.

113
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,930
那晚你带着它和我一起去溜冰 记得吗?
You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?

114
00:05:03,932 --> 00:05:05,799
你是说我一人在溜冰
You mean the night that I went ice-skating,

115
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:07,184
而你站在扶手栏杆边
and you stood at the rail

116
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:09,219
谷歌体温过低症状的那晚?
Googling the symptoms of hypothermia?

117
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:14,391
咱们合作多愉快啊 是咩?
We made one heck of a team, huh?

118
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:18,862
这是谁的罩罩?
Whose bra is this?

119
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,815
这不是你的?
It's not yours?

120
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:24,951
哎呀呀
Oh, my.

121
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:27,037
这也太尴尬了
How embarrassing for both of us.

122
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:30,457
这是Penny的
It's Penny's.

123
00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:32,242
嘿 你已经和我分手了
Hey, you broke up with me.

124
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:33,910
我乐意去揉搓谁那一团
It is none of your business

125
00:05:33,912 --> 00:05:36,963
裸露的胸部 和你无关
whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough.

126
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:38,248
再见
Good-bye.

127
00:05:42,638 --> 00:05:43,753
Amy开门
Amy.

128
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,138
Amy开门 Amy开门
Amy. Amy.

129
00:05:47,893 --> 00:05:49,976
嗯 桌子也能起作用
Hmm. Tables work, too.

130
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,645
真不错
Good to know.

131
00:05:54,016 --> 00:05:57,100
你为女孩之夜做了布朗尼蛋糕!
Ooh, brownies for girls' night!

132
00:05:57,102 --> 00:05:58,602
把手拿开 我在生你的气
Hands off. I'm mad at you.

133
00:05:59,822 --> 00:06:01,571
听着 我知道我花了一大笔钱
Look, I know it's a lot of money,

134
00:06:01,573 --> 00:06:03,323
但是店里那人说
but the guy at the store said

135
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:06,243
大概过个五六年 这东西会自己涨价的
in five to seven years, it'll pay for itself.

136
00:06:06,245 --> 00:06:08,378
什么东西会自己涨价?
What will pay for itself?

137
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:15,669
没什么 你生我什么气呢?
Doesn't matter. What are you mad about?

138
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:19,122
我气你告诉我
I'm mad at you for blabbing to me

139
00:06:19,124 --> 00:06:20,924
Leonard在北海做的那些事
what Leonard did on the North Sea,

140
00:06:20,926 --> 00:06:22,292
所以这两年里
and I'm mad that I've had to hide this

141
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,710
我都要向Penny瞒着这事
from Penny for two years.

142
00:06:23,712 --> 00:06:26,546
你因为这事生气是应该的
And you have every right to be mad about those things.

143
00:06:26,548 --> 00:06:28,632
不如 你把这个月的信用卡账单
So, why don't you let me

144
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,134
给我来保管 怎么样?
handle the credit card bill this month, huh?

145
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,853
就不劳烦你看了
I mean, don't even look at it.

146
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:36,473
我是说 假如Penny知道了这么久以来
I mean, if Penny finds out I've known all this time

147
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:37,724
我都瞒着她
and haven't told her,

148
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:39,609
她就会觉得我这个朋友不值得交
she's gonna think I'm a terrible friend.

149
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,228
要是你没告诉我就好了
I wish you never told me.

150
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,613
要是Leonard没告诉我才好呢
And I wish Leonard never told me.

151
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:45,732
他做错事 他才是坏人
He's the bad guy here.

152
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:49,152
你说的对
I guess that's true.

153
00:06:49,154 --> 00:06:50,987
而你却让Penny嫁给了他
And you let Penny marry him.

154
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,792
对比这事 我买了一个乔治克鲁尼的
Compared to that, who cares if I bought

155
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:58,378
限量版体毛修剪套件又算得上什么呢?
a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?

156
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:06,002
您好 我打电话想了解一下你们婚姻咨询服务
Hi. I'm calling about your marriage counseling services

157
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:09,172
也想问一下费用怎么计
and was curious what your rate is.

158
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:13,009
你是在逗我
Really?

159
00:07:13,011 --> 00:07:14,815
好吧
Um, okay.

160
00:07:14,817 --> 00:07:17,885
结婚不久有没有折扣打?
Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage?

161
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:22,056
因为也就结了那么几十小时
'Cause we're just talking hours here.

162
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,061
- 嗨  - 等会打给你
- Hi.  - Call you back.

163
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,062
嘿
Hey.

164
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,596
我们能谈谈吗?
Can we talk?

165
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:30,814
我很乐意
I would love that.

166
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:36,603
好的 听着
All right, look,

167
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:38,605
我对我结婚之前说一切都没问题
I'm sorry I said I was okay with everything

168
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:39,857
这事感到很抱歉
before we got married.

169
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,275
我很讨厌我们现在这个状态
I hate that we're going through this,

170
00:07:41,277 --> 00:07:42,743
但是我又不知道该怎么办
but I don't know what to do.

171
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,945
你要是不介意上团购排队抢票
If you don't mind waiting for a Groupon,

172
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:47,114
我们可以试试婚姻咨询
we can try marriage counseling.

173
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,750
哈喽
Hello.

174
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:50,851
嘿 兄弟
Hey, uh, buddy,

175
00:07:50,853 --> 00:07:52,119
可以给我们空间单独谈话吗?
can we have some privacy?

176
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:53,504
当然可以
Oh, of course.

177
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,789
不会打扰你们
Wouldn't want to intrude.

178
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,958
这是你的
This is yours.

179
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:05,883
好的 等我和他说完
Okay, when I'm done with him,

180
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,801
我要你给我解释清楚
I'm gonna need more information.

181
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,053
没什么大不了的
Nothing odd.

182
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,021
只不过想用来气Amy罢了
I just wanted to rub Amy's nose in it.

183
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:14,358
好了 我知道我可能反应过激了
Okay, look, I might be overreacting,

184
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,477
但是一想到你明天
but how am I supposed to get past this

185
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,395
去工作就要见到这个女人
when I know tomorrow you're gonna go to work

186
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,980
你让我怎么忍受的了?
and see this woman?

187
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:21,365
请原谅我偷听了
Forgive me for eavesdropping,

188
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:24,902
但是依我看 有个简单的解决办法
but as I see it, there's a simple solution.

189
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,671
醒醒 快醒醒 快醒醒
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

190
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,610
带Penny去见Mandy
Bring Penny to meet Mandy.

191
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,546
什么? 为什么?
What? Why?

192
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:38,298
目前为止 Penny难以控制她的想象
Well, right now, Penny's imagination is running wild,

193
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,134
但是假如见面了 神秘感消失
but if they meet, that will eliminate

194
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:42,669
她的担忧也会减少
the mystery and alleviate her fears.

195
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:46,306
就像卖斯帕克林矿泉水的那个人让我掀开了他的眼罩
Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch.

196
00:08:49,145 --> 00:08:52,930
首先 你把他气哭了
Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry.

197
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,849
然后我们就知道了 没有眼球也是可以哭的
And we learned that you don't need an eyeball to do that.

198
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:01,605
第二 我觉得Penny和Mandy见面这主意
Secondly, I can't think of a more horrible idea

199
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,190
实在太糟糕了
than Penny meeting Mandy.

200
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:05,275
是吗? 为什么这么说?
Really? Why is that?

201
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:06,660
你真的想见她吗?
What, you actually want to meet her?

202
00:09:06,662 --> 00:09:07,911
本来不想 看你现在遮遮掩掩的
No, but now that you're being weird about it,

203
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:08,996
也许我就该见见
maybe I should.

204
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:09,997
我没有遮遮掩掩
I'm not being weird.

205
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,031
我有遮掩吗?
Am I being weird?

206
00:09:11,033 --> 00:09:13,750
有
Yes.

207
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,270
这种感觉我都看出来了
And that's coming from me.

208
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:19,089
好吧 你想去见她?
Fine, you want to meet her?

209
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,841
不 我就是想确认你们工作的时候
No, I just want to know that when you're at work,

210
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:22,209
什么事都不会发生
there's nothing going on.

211
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,594
要和你说多少次你才能信?
How many times do I have to tell you?

212
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,212
我对这个女人没有兴趣
I have no interest in this woman.

213
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,597
那也有可能是她对你有兴趣啊
Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you.

214
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,182
对Leonard有兴趣?
In Leonard?

215
00:09:28,184 --> 00:09:30,384
连那个卖矿泉水的都知道这事根本不可能
Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see that's unlikely.

216
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,608
我觉得最大的问题是
I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard

217
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,695
我没想到Leonard竟会做出这种事情来
as the kind of guy who would do something like this.

218
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:48,364
人总会在软弱的时候犯错误
Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.

219
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:50,233
你怎么想呢?
What do you think?

220
00:09:51,236 --> 00:09:53,069
呃 我不知道该怎么想
Oh, I don't know what to think.

221
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:56,072
但是我再强调一遍 我也是刚刚才知道
But then again, I just found out about it.

222
00:09:58,043 --> 00:10:00,243
你知道的 我之所以爱上Leonard
You know, I fell in love with Leonard

223
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:01,744
就是因为他和我之前约过的那些男人
because he wasn't anything like the guys

224
00:10:01,746 --> 00:10:03,162
完全不一样
I was used to dating.

225
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,997
我知道以前那些男的劈腿劈惯了
I mean, I knew those guys weren't above cheating

226
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:08,051
因为通常劈的就是我
because that's usually how we met.

227
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:10,386
拜托 你知道Leonard不是这样的人
Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.

228
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:12,555
我特别想相信你 真的
I want to believe you. I really do.

229
00:10:12,557 --> 00:10:14,924
我是不是很幼稚啊?
Am I being naive?

230
00:10:14,926 --> 00:10:16,592
呃 我不知道
Oh, I don't know.

231
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,561
这些都超出了我理解范围
This is all so new to me.

232
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:21,564
我还在消化
I'm still processing.

233
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,434
你知道的 他第一次见我的时候 可绝不会做这种事
You know, he never would've done this when we first met.

234
00:10:24,436 --> 00:10:25,735
他现在胆子大了
He's cockier now.

235
00:10:25,737 --> 00:10:27,737
那是因为你让他有信心了
That's because you made him more confident.

236
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:30,406
想想看 如果没有你 
You know, if you think about it, without you,

237
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:32,642
他也不会成为现在的他
he never would've grown into the person he is now.

238
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:35,495
说真心的 更多美女会注意到他
I mean, sure, more women might notice him,

239
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:37,497
但我觉得他和你在一起更好
but I think it's better to have a guy be with you

240
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:39,082
因为他想和你一起
because he wants to be

241
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:41,300
而不是因为 他除了你别无选择
and not because he thinks he doesn't have any other choice.

242
00:10:41,302 --> 00:10:43,619
我从来不这么想
I never thought about it like that.

243
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:46,122
呃 我也是 刚刚才想到的
Oh, me neither, not until just now.

244
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,294
大家好 我是Sheldon Cooper博士
Hello. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

245
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:54,297
欢迎来到 "Sheldon Cooper出品: 旗乐无穷"
and welcome to "Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags".

246
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,233
大家可能已经注意到了 我拿了一个遥控器
You may notice that I'm holding a remote control.

247
00:10:57,235 --> 00:10:59,652
那是因为我的摄影师兼主持搭档
That's because my cameraperson and co-host,

248
00:10:59,654 --> 00:11:01,254
Amy Farrah Fowler博士
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

249
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:04,190
已经决定终止我们之间的关系
has chosen to end her relationship with me.

250
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:08,895
我暂停一下 好让你们消化一下
I'm going to pause here to let that sink in.

251
00:11:16,137 --> 00:11:17,737
好的
Okay.

252
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,288
如果你想让暂停更长一点
If you need to pause a little longer,

253
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,574
请摁暂停键
just click the pause button.

254
00:11:21,576 --> 00:11:23,676
当然 节目必须继续
But the show must go on.

255
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:26,379
还有 我只需用一只右手
And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do

256
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,798
就能完全代替我女朋友
can be taken care of with my right hand.

257
00:11:36,307 --> 00:11:39,408
好了 别浪费时间说她了
Anyway, let's not spend any more time talking about her.

258
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,676
我们是来说旗子的
We're here to talk about flags.

259
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:41,894
今晚的主题是:
Tonight's theme:

260
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,896
心碎国家的旗帜
flags of countries that have been torn apart

261
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:46,399
与一个我认为应该对此负责的女人
and the women I have a feeling were responsible.

262
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,888
你们知道去找一个婚姻咨询师
You guys have any idea how much it costs

263
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:53,256
要花多少钱吗?
to see a marriage counselor?

264
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:54,724
250刀一小时 问这个干嘛?
$250 an hour. Why?

265
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:57,360
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

266
00:11:57,362 --> 00:11:59,662
我和Bernadette曾经去过一次
Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to,

267
00:11:59,664 --> 00:12:01,664
你懂得 要保持爱情的感觉
you know, stay on top of things.

268
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:05,201
然后你现在才告诉我?
And I'm just hearing about this now?

269
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:07,036
兄弟 虽然我们是最好的朋友
Dude, just because we're best friends

270
00:12:07,038 --> 00:12:09,755
但是这不代表我得把什么都告诉你啊
doesn't mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on.

271
00:12:09,757 --> 00:12:12,275
不是必须告诉我 而是你应该想着告诉我
You don't have to, you should want to.

272
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,595
得了 Mandy过来了
Oh, great, there's Mandy.

273
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:20,216
为什么海洋生物学家都漂亮?
Why are marine biologists always so cute?

274
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:22,185
不知道
I don't know,

275
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:25,221
不过我愿意迷失在她的百慕大三角里
but I'd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle.

276
00:12:26,107 --> 00:12:27,390
说这个有卵用
That's not helpful.

277
00:12:27,392 --> 00:12:29,108
那我不会说
Then I won't say

278
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,195
我想趴在她四分之三的表面上
I'd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.

279
00:12:32,197 --> 00:12:33,563
你们够了没有?
Are we done?

280
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:35,231
还没 这个太有意思了
Not yet, this is fun.

281
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,066
噢 我有了
Ooh, I know.

282
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:39,452
我想让她帮我放松一下老二
I'd let her free my willy.

283
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,070
你干嘛去?
Where you going?

284
00:12:41,072 --> 00:12:43,272
我想问问她 是否愿意见见Penny
I'm gonna ask her if she'd be willing to talk to Penny,

285
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,657
告诉她 我们之间没什么好担心的
tell her she has nothing to worry about.

286
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:46,158
- 等等 Leonard  - 怎么?
- Leonard, wait.  - What?

287
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,127
我想把她的海绵裤剪碎
I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.

288
00:12:48,963 --> 00:12:51,581
现在我们够了
Now we are done.

289
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,800
嘿
Hey.

290
00:12:54,802 --> 00:12:55,885
嗨 Leonard 怎么了?
Oh, hi, Leonard. What's up?

291
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:57,753
呃 我坐下你不介意吧?
Uh, do you mind if I sit?

292
00:12:57,755 --> 00:12:59,388
当然
Sure.

293
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,424
呃 我一直在想我们俩
So, um, I've been thinking a lot

294
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:04,227
还有... 船上的事
about you and me and... the boat.

295
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:05,061
想这个干嘛?
What about it?

296
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:06,345
你知道的...
You know...

297
00:13:06,347 --> 00:13:08,264
当时我们喝醉了以后做的事
what we did, when we were drunk.

298
00:13:08,266 --> 00:13:11,901
呃 那天我也睡了你吗?
Oh, no, did I sleep with you, too?

299
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:14,237
没有 我们亲了而已
No, we just made out.

300
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:16,105
噢 那就好
Oh. Well, good for me.

301
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:19,242
有什么能为你做的吗?
So what can I do for you?

302
00:13:19,244 --> 00:13:22,612
呃 是这样的 我最近结婚了
Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently.

303
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:23,996
噢 恭喜!
Oh, congratulations!

304
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:26,499
和Sheldon吗?
To Sheldon?

305
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,502
还是一样好笑啊
Never gets old.

306
00:13:29,504 --> 00:13:32,255
不是的 和一个女孩儿
No, no, to a girl.

307
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:34,674
呃 我跟她说了我们之间的事情
Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me,

308
00:13:34,676 --> 00:13:37,343
她很担心 因为我们在工作中总是碰面
and she's concerned about us seeing each other at work.

309
00:13:37,345 --> 00:13:39,929
就是亲了一下而已 你干嘛告诉她?
It was just a kiss. Why would you even tell her?

310
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:42,632
因为我不想跟她之间有秘密
Because I didn't want there to be any secrets between us.

311
00:13:42,634 --> 00:13:44,133
真的是因为这个吗?
Is that really the reason?

312
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:46,319
还能是因为什么?
What else would it be?

313
00:13:46,321 --> 00:13:47,803
我不知道啊
I don't know.

314
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:49,522
听上去好像你要毁了这段关系了
Sounds like you're trying to sabotage the relationship.

315
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:51,807
不会 我不这么觉得
No, I don't think so.

316
00:13:51,809 --> 00:13:55,144
虽然 Penny说的跟你说的一模一样
Although, Penny did say exactly that.

317
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:57,780
呃 那你就应该好好想想了
Okay, well, that's something to think about.

318
00:13:57,782 --> 00:14:00,816
你知道的 有时候 我觉得
You know, on some level, I've always believed

319
00:14:00,818 --> 00:14:02,852
我配不上她这样一个女孩儿
that I don't deserve a woman like her.

320
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:05,571
呃 你打算就在这儿想这个么?
Oh, you're gonna think about that right here?

321
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,792
她真的很漂亮
I mean, she's really beautiful.

322
00:14:09,794 --> 00:14:11,711
世上的男人她想拥有谁都可以
She could have any guy she wants.

323
00:14:11,713 --> 00:14:13,379
她花了那么多年
Which is probably why

324
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:16,165
才和我说她爱我估计也是这个原因
it took her so many years to tell me she loved me.

325
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:18,634
也许你应该去找个心理医生谈一谈
Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this.

326
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,836
太贵了
Too expensive.

327
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,891
我应该是很习惯女人在对我表达感情的时候有所保留的
You'd think I'd be used to women withholding their love.

328
00:14:25,893 --> 00:14:27,310
我妈就是这样
I mean, my mother did.

329
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:29,145
不管我多努力
I mean, no matter how hard I tried,

330
00:14:29,147 --> 00:14:31,147
她都对我一点兴趣也没有
she just didn't have any interest in me.

331
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:33,733
真是没法想象
Imagine that.

332
00:14:33,735 --> 00:14:35,518
不知道这是不是为什么
I wonder if that's why I have

333
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,820
我和Sheldon之间有那么不正常的关系
such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon.

334
00:14:37,822 --> 00:14:39,238
我做了一个梦
I had a dream

335
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,907
我在一个山洞里
the other night that I was in a cave

336
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,027
我在照顾一个婴儿
and I was nursing a baby,

337
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,864
但是那个婴儿的头是Sheldon的
but the baby had Sheldon's head on it.

338
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:53,753
你妻子还担心我?
And your wife is worried about me?

339
00:14:54,706 --> 00:14:55,921
嘿 Leonard!
Hey, Leonard!

340
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:57,123
你谈完了过来
When you're done,

341
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,709
我们又想出了好多
we came up with a bunch more.

342
00:15:03,047 --> 00:15:05,548
然后捷克共和国对斯洛伐克说
Then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia,

343
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,050
"我觉得你根本不懂分手是什么意思!"
"I don't think you understand how being broken up works!"

344
00:15:08,052 --> 00:15:10,102
你能相信吗?
Can you believe that?

345
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:11,721
按常理说捷克共和国
You'd think that the Czech Republic

346
00:15:11,723 --> 00:15:13,356
应该会珍惜自己所拥有的东西
would try to hold on to what it had,

347
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:15,274
因为它已经不像以前那么年轻了
given that it's not as young as it used to be.

348
00:15:15,276 --> 00:15:17,226
而且我也没见什么别的国家
And I don't see any other countries

349
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:20,329
排着队从南边对它的边境发起进攻啊
lining up to invade its southern borders.

350
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:22,314
我要把他杀了
I'm gonna kill him.

351
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,234
不说捷克共和国了
But enough about the Czech Republic.

352
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:27,787
有一次摩尔多瓦给罗马尼亚
Let's talk about the time Moldova made Romania

353
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:30,706
做了一个生日蛋糕 罗马尼亚说那个蛋糕很好吃
a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good

354
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,907
但其实它一点都不好吃
even though it didn't.

355
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,743
但是罗马尼亚还是被甩了
And yet Romania gets dumped.

356
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,162
我现在暂停 让你们反应一下
I'll pause here while you mull that one over.

357
00:15:38,082 --> 00:15:40,166
我说呢 对吧?
I know, right?

358
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:47,139
你说你有话想对我说
So, you said you had something to tell me.

359
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:48,591
好的 是的 嗯
Okay, yeah, um,

360
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:50,393
你记得你说我
do you remember when you accused me

361
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:52,144
想故意破坏我们的婚姻吗?
of trying to sabotage our wedding?

362
00:15:52,146 --> 00:15:54,263
嗯
Uh-huh.

363
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:57,016
我想了很久 你可能说对了
I've been thinking about it, and you might be right.

364
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,688
但是好在我觉得我知道这是为什么
But the good news is that I'm pretty sure I know why.

365
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,440
继续说
I'm listening.

366
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:07,276
Penny 这么多年了
Penny, after all these years,

367
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,779
我还是感觉也许我配不上你
I still feel like maybe I don't deserve you.

368
00:16:11,032 --> 00:16:12,782
好吧 这是全天下
Okay, that is the lamest excuse

369
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:15,117
最差劲的借口了
you could've possibly come up with.

370
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:17,920
但我懂
But I get it.

371
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,121
真的?
You do?

372
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:20,673
是啊
Yeah.

373
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,041
有时候我害怕你会有一天
Sometimes I worry you're gonna wake up

374
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:24,126
离开我去和一个更像你的人在一起
and leave me for someone more like you.

375
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,464
我连你为什么会和我这种人在一起都不知道
I don't even understand why you're with someone like me.

376
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:31,434
我怎么会想和我这种人在一起?
Why would I want to be with someone like me?

377
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:33,102
你知道我的意思的
You know what I mean.

378
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:35,438
而且 也许我对这件事情的反应
And, you know, maybe the way I've been reacting

379
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,141
也是在破坏我们的婚姻
was me sabotaging this, too.

380
00:16:39,143 --> 00:16:42,161
我们能不能不再这样
Well, how about we stop

381
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,930
害怕失去对方
being so scared of losing each other

382
00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:46,465
好好在一起呢?
and just be together?

383
00:16:46,467 --> 00:16:49,151
听上去不错
That sounds nice.

384
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,202
真好
Good.

385
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:53,205
因为...
Because...

386
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:55,424
我第一次见到你就爱上你了
I've loved you since the moment we met,

387
00:16:55,426 --> 00:16:58,494
我会一直爱你 直到海枯石烂
and I will keep loving you until the end of time.

388
00:16:58,496 --> 00:16:59,962
哦
Oh.

389
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:01,997
天啊 这是我听过的
Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing

390
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:04,333
- 最美的话了  - 是吗?
- anyone's ever said to me.  - Yeah?

391
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:07,486
那是因为你很美
That's because you're beautiful,

392
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:12,007
你的美浇灌着我的心田
and your beauty fills my heart with love and song.

393
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:16,245
现在有点肉麻了吧 Leonard
It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.

394
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,480
额?
Huh?

395
00:17:17,482 --> 00:17:20,015
如果你觉得这肉麻的话 忍着点
If you think that's cheesy, buckle up.

396
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:24,119
Penny Hofstadter啊
Penny Hofstadter,

397
00:17:24,121 --> 00:17:26,188
你愿意继续做我的妻子吗?
will you please stay married to me?

398
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:29,191
妈的 你太强了
Oh, damn it, you topped it.

399
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,197
我们要不要去卧室里把这场婚礼正式办完啊?
Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?

400
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,916
- 要!  - 好的!
- Yes, please!  - Okay!

401
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:48,880
Sheldon 真不敢相信你给我们了一份结婚礼物
Sheldon, I can't believe you got us a wedding gift.

402
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,599
真不知道你们那么吃惊干什么
I don't know why you're so surprised.

403
00:17:50,601 --> 00:17:53,885
我也看电影的 我知道人们通常会做什么
I watch movies; I see what people do.

404
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,771
这是什么?
What is this?

405
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,773
旧金山周末游的
Plane tickets and hotel reservations

406
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,775
机票和酒店预订
for a weekend away in San Francisco.

407
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:01,059
哦! 哇!
Oh! Wow!

408
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,811
太棒了!
That's so great!

409
00:18:02,813 --> 00:18:05,864
是啊 有渔人码头 恶魔岛 还有缆车
Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars.

410
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,315
我们一定能玩得很开心的
We're gonna have so much fun.

411
00:18:11,572 --> 00:18:13,038
我们?
We?

412
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,072
有问题吗?
Is there a problem?

413
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:16,491
哦 没有! 我刚刚说的是"太棒了!"
Oh, no, no! I just, I said, "Whee!"

414
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:21,913
你竟敢在网上说我坏话
How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me

415
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:25,300
还把我的生殖器比作捷克斯洛伐克的一个地区?!
and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?!

416
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,804
你把那集看完了 是吗?
You saw through that one, did you?

417
00:18:28,806 --> 00:18:30,305
我真不知道你在想什么
I don't know what you were thinking,

418
00:18:30,307 --> 00:18:33,308
但你给我把那个视频撤下来!
but take the video down now!

419
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:36,495
她看了
She watched it.

420
00:18:36,497 --> 00:18:38,096
我能把她追回来的
I'm gonna get that girl back.

421
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:41,483
我看了是因为你把它用邮件发给我了
I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me

422
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,719
标题还写了"你看了这个肯定会生气"!
with the subject line: "This is gonna make you mad"!

423
00:18:47,321 --> 00:18:49,554
她在门外听我说话 她想要我
She was listening through the door. She wants me.
