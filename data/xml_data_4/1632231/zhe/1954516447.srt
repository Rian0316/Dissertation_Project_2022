1
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,040

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,370
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,310
Guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,050
It's really nice to see you again, Leonard.

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,070
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,520
Here you go.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:13,990
Thanks.

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,210
- You slept with my sister?! - Yeah.

9
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,920
This is a terrible betrayal of my trust!

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,770
Would it help if I told you

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,290
that I offered her my heart,

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,860
and she kinda stomped on it?!

13
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,100
How hard did she stomp?

14
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,590
Very hard.

15
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:31,870
Okay, I'm good.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,340
What's so funny?

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,150
Nothing. Just thinking

18
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,060
about the noises people make during sex.

19
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,240
I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don't I?

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,770
It's cute.

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,360
You sound a little like a drunken monkey.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,010
You know it's meant as a compliment.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,890
That's how I take it.

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,590
This is perfect.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,470
I hope this moment never ends.

26
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,900
Me, too.

27
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,570
Well, gotta go. Oh!

28
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,480
Already? Why don't you stay over?

29
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,510
I'd love to, but you know

30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,940
my mother needs me in the morning.

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,730
Please. I think the woman can manage

32
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,200
to put a wig on by herself.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,220
It's not just the wig.

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,600
It's pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows.

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,290
It's a two-person job.

36
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,930
It's just, when you leave right after we make love,

37
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,640
it makes me feel...

38
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,210
cheap.

39
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,110
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,720
What can I do?

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,170
Stay.

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,710
Okay.

43
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,310
Like, what, another five, ten minutes?

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,060
Go home.

45
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,560
Your call.

46
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,240
Howard...

47
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,070
have you ever considered us living together?

48
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,050
Boy, I don't know.

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,100
You, me, Ma living under the same roof?

50
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,470
No, I mean just you and me.

51
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,400
You can move in here,

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,210
or we can find a place.

53
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,840
- I've got a better solution. - What?

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,540
We wait for my mom's heart to explode

55
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,270
from all the salt she eats.

56
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,740
Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress

57
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,370
and move into the big bedroom.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,300
Great.

59
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,020
Look at us planning a future together!

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,910
Who's there?!

61
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,870
Are you a sex criminal?!

62
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,460
Sex criminals don't have keys, Ma!

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,460
Where were you so late?!

64
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,430
I was out with Bernadette!

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,120
I know what that means!

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,200
I watch Dr. Phil!

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,200

68
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,190
I hope to God you used a condom!

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,020
I'm not having this conversation with you, Ma!

70
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,600
God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!

71
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,720
Nobody has a disease!

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,180
I hope not!

73
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,440
I share a toilet with you!

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,290
Is that what you want?!

75
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,840
To give your mother herpes?!

76
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,100
That's it! I don't have to take this!

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,780
Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!

78
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,690
Who's there?!

79
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,840
Are you a sex criminal?!

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,720
I'm still leaving!

81
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,170
I just forgot my Claritin!

82
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,170

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,510
Hey, what's up?

84
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,310
I need a place to crash.

85
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,420
Uh, sure.

86
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,070
Why?

87
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:26,880
Big fight with my mother.

88
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,580
Still arguing over which CSI is the best?

89
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,860
No, we agreed they all have their merits.

90
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
This was about Bernadette.

91
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,180
What's going on?

92
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,500
Howard's gonna sleep here tonight.

93
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,030
He had a fight with his mother.

94
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,960
Did you offer him a hot beverage?

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,350
No.

96
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,280
Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset,

97
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,840
you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.

98
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,760
Tea does sound nice.

99
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,170
You heard the man, Leonard.

100
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,580
And while you're at it, I'm upset

101
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,910
that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa.

102
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,010
Point of inquiry,

103
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,620
given that Leonard is your secondary friend

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,650
and Koothrappali is your primary friend,

105
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,210
why didn't you seek refuge under his roof?

106
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,130
There's no room.

107
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,410
His sister is staying with him.

108
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,980
Wait, wait. What?

109
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,370
Cocoa, Leonard. Focus.

110
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,980
I'm down in the dumps here.

111
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,790
Priya's in town?

112
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,300
Yeah, some work thing.

113
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,850
Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette...

114
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,220
Hold on. When did Priya get here?

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,510
I don't know. A couple of days ago.

116
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,250
The thing is, Bernadette doesn't like that I have to take care

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,480
of my mother, and my mother doesn't trust Bernadette...

118
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,310
Yeah, that's a real pickle.

119
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,590
Bye.

120
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,530
Don't worry.

121
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,310
As your tertiary friend,

122
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,830
I am prepared to step in and comfort you.

123
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,540
That's not really necessary.

124
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,140
No, no. I'll finish making the tea,

125
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,840
while you narcissistically ramble on

126
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,810
about whatever's troubling you.

127
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,960
Thanks.

128
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,370
That's what tertiary friends are for.

129
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,050
Who is it?

130
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,430
It's Leonard.

131
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,520
You can't come in.

132
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,000
I just want to talk to her.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,670
I forbid it.

134
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,180
Open the door, Rajesh.

135
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,130
You heard me.

136
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,780
I forbidded it.

137
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,090
"Forbidded" it?

138
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:38,520
"Forbaded" it?

139
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,630
Get out of the way.

140
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,490
What are you doing here?

141
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,690
What are you doing here?

142
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,560
I have business in Los Angeles.

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
Why didn't you call?

144
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,020
Clearly, she was sending you a message

145
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,040
to take a hike, Mike.

146
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm sorry. I thought about calling,

147
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,100
but I just wasn't sure if seeing you was such a good idea.

148
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,840
I know. Last time I came on too strong.

149
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,350
Can we talk in private?

150
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,090
- No! - Sure.

151
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,400
It's completely inappropriate for a single woman

152
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,960
to entertain a man in private.

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,770
If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch!

154
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,510
All right, you may talk in the bedroom,

155
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,580
but I want this door to remain open!

156
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,630
All right, just this once you may close the door.

157
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,170
But keep in mind I'll be right out here

158
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,900
monitoring the situation!

159
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,440
Oh, damn it.

160
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,950
Leonard, when you get this message, call me.

161
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,520
Priya, this is your brother.

162
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,350
When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.

163
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,540
Would you be sleeping over again this evening?

164
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,290
Because you're welcome to.

165
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,580
That's very nice of you, but I made other plans.

166
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,020
Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need

167
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,920
a slightly apathetic tertiary friend,

168
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,460
I stand at the ready.

169
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.

170
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,210
- Hello. - Hey.

171
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,140
Why are you holding hands?

172
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,120
I forbid you to hold hands.

173
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,750
Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.

174
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,970
Yeah, but you were just sleeping,

175
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,260
because I forboded you to have sex.

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,550
The word is "forbade""

177
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,410
You sure? That doesn't sound right.

178
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,390
Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided

179
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,830
to see each other again,

180
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,190
and you don't get to tell me

181
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,760
who I can and can't have a relationship with.

182
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,440
Actually, he can.

183
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,300
The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters.

184
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,330
If a woman's father is not around,

185
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:50,050
the duty of controlling her base desires falls

186
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,880
to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj.

187
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,940
The code also states

188
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,670
that if she disobeys, she will be reborn

189
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,950
"in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases."

190
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,940
If true,

191
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
that seems like an awfully large gamble

192
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,620
given that the prize is Leonard.

193
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,050
There it is, Priya. We're Indian.

194
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,570
We believe this stuff.

195
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,110
I think it also says that if you eat beef,

196
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,700
you need to live with cows for three months

197
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,790
and drink their urine.

198
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,030
Some of it makes sense, some of it's crazy.

199
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,540
My point is, you can't go out with Leonard.

200
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,670
Who can't go out with Leonard?

201
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,080
My sister.

202
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,270
Penny, this is Raj's sister, Priya.

203
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,560
It's very nice to meet you.

204
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,180
Oh, yeah, you, too.

205
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,350
Priya, if you're experiencing any tension or awkwardness,

206
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,380
it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to--

207
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,440
if I may quote Howard-- "do the dance with no pants."

208
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,100
Sheldon!

209
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,370
Really?

210
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,380
Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?

211
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,570
Sure.

212
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,660
Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard

213
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,520
as a lover.

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,730
Would you please tell my sister why?

215
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,680
Listen, my mom's going to Palm Springs

216
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,880
to visit her sister.

217
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,730
That's two whole nights in a row I can sleep over

218
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,160
with you all the way to morning.

219
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,940
Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses,

220
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,280
in which case I'll have to schlep out there

221
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,870
with the big humidifier.

222
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,440
That's it?

223
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,660
That's your big solution to all of our problems?

224
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,690
If your mom's nose holds up, we get two nights together?

225
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,070
Isn't that great?

226
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,250
No, it's not great.

227
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,010
You need to make a choice.Me or your mother.

228
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,370
Wrong answer.

229
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,860
No, wait.

230
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,800
You didn't let me finish.

231
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm listening.

232
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,360
I came as quickly as I could.

233
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,240
Okay.

234
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,510
Why?

235
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,430
To comfort you, of course.

236
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,970
Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh's sister.

237
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,160
So I high-tailed it over here

238
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,460
to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.

239
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,310
Amy, I'm fine.

240
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,520
You don't have to be strong for me.

241
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,290
Now let's talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.

242
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,710
What?

243
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,110
In situations like this,

244
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,250
best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman.

245
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,030
Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.

246
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,190
Oh. Then perhaps you don't understand what's going on.

247
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,130
Your former boyfriend has replaced you

248
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,230
with what appears to be a very suitable mate.

249
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,840
Arguably much more suitable than you.

250
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,170
Oh. Well, good for him.

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,750
Hey, what do you mean, "More suitable"?

252
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,290
Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics

253
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,550
are reasonably bodacious.

254
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,870
but Priya is highly educated,

255
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,330
she's an accomplished professional,she comes from the culture

256
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,630
that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex.

257
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,530
Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout

258
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,580
who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.

259
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,020
Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it.

260
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,150
So... what is all that stuff?

261
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,670
This is a portable electroencephalogram.

262
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,090
I'm doing research on emotions and brain activity.

263
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,180
So when you start crying,

264
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,750
I can see which region of the brain is activated.

265
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,460
Then I'm going to stimulate the analogous area

266
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,220
in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries.

267
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,540
Cool, huh?

268
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,570
I choose you.

269
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,320
Really?

270
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,160
Yep. I moved out of my mother's house.

271
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,450
Cord is cut.I'm all yours.

272
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,750
What did she say when you told her?

273
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,630
I don't know. She hasn't responded to my email yet.

274
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,690
This is so great.

275
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,330
I love you, Howard.

276
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,800
I love you, too.

277
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,230
So what's for dinner?

278
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,910
Well, I don't really have much of anything in the house.

279
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,130
That's fine.

280
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,960
Why don't we go fool around in our bedroom?

281
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
And then you can go shopping.

282
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,280
I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.

283
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,680
I'd love that.

284
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,600
I love the way you say, "I'd love that."

285
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,830
She says it the same way I do.

286
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,020
"I'd love that."

287
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,940
Everybody in India says it that way.It's not a big deal.

288
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,900
Rajesh, don't be a child.

289
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,460
I'm not being a child.

290
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,410
Leonard, I swear to God,

291
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,430
if your sister ever comes to town,

292
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,460
I shall have my way with her.

293
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,760
My sister's 38 and married.

294
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,030

295
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,030
All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.

296
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,220
Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.

297
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,470
That's remarkable.

298
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,760
If pepperoni were an explosive substance,

299
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,310
you could replace German shepherds at our nation's airports.

300
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,730
Hi. Penny, right?

301
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,790
Oh, yes. H-Hi. I'm sorry.

302
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,910
I didn't know you had company. I don't want to impose.

303
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,490
No, no. It's not an imposition.

304
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,990
At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover,

305
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,940

306
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,940
a small scavenging bird that eats extra food

307
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,390
from between the teeth of crocodiles.

308
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,460
Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.

309
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,810
If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator,

310
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,550
I wouldn't have to take that.

311
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,480
Hi, bestie.

312
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
Hi.

313
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,620
So, um, Priya, you're a lawyer, right?

314
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,290
I know. Pretty boring, huh?

315
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,860
Oh, come on. It's not boring at all.

316
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,200
She's currently helping set up a secondary derivative market

317
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,840
which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments

318
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,920
against potential advancements in battery technology.

319
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,260
Thank you, Leonard.

320
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,920
That doesn't make it sound boring at all.

321
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm sorry , but...

322
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,370
So, how you holding up?

323
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,140
I'm fine.

324
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,570
Oh, who are you kidding? She's breathtaking.

325
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,470
So, Penny,

326
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,930
Leonard tells me you're an actress.

327
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,840
That must be pretty exciting.

328
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,430
Oh, yeah, yeah. It's real great.

329
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,040
Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition

330
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,380
I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial.

331
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,460
Turned out to be porn.

332
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,110
Did you get the part?

333
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,830
I didn't do the audition.

334
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,220
Given the state of your career,

335
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,490
can you really afford to be picky?

336
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,260
I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge.

337
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,470
I loved it.

338
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,980
We did Taming of the Shrew.

339
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,170
Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew.

340
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,650
I did a paper on it in high school.

341
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:00,560
"Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting?

342
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
In his tail."

343
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,770
- "In his tongue" - "Whose tongue?"

344
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,290
"Yours, if you talk of tails,

345
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,640
and so farewell."

346
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,560
"What, with my tongue in your tail?"

347
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,820
I'm regretting my earlier cattiness.

348
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,210
She is an absolute delight.

349
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,450
Wow.

350
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,540
Wow, indeed.

351
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,710
I can't believe we're finally living together.

352
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:38,950
Yeah.

353
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,330
You know what would make this moment perfect?

354
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,230
What?

355
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,000
A little snack. You got any string cheese?

356
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,730
No. I-I might have some cheddar.

357
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,840
Not as good.

358
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,670
You can't make strings with it.

359
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,220
Remind me to put it on your shopping list.

360
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:57,690
Okay.

361
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,820
You have hypo-allergenic detergent?

362
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,910
No.

363
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,250
Better put it on the list.

364
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,010
If you wash my underwear with regular soap,

365
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,420
I get little red bumps on my tuchus.

366
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,530
Wait a second.

367
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,600
I'm doing your laundry?

368
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,430
Well, honey, it's not gonna do itself.

369
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,350
Oh, before I forget,

370
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,740
tomorrow morning, you're driving me to the dentist.

371
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,840
I have to take you?

372
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,870
You don't have to take me. You get to take me.

373
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,420
Wait a minute. Are you telling me

374
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,410
your mother usually takes you to the dentist?

375
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,430
It's not weird.

376
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,100
There's lots of kids there with their moms.

377
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,520
I can't believe this.

378
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,350
What? It's fun.

379
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,380
If I have no cavities,

380
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,660
afterwards, we go out for a treat.

381
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,070
All right, Howard,

382
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,980
let's get something straight right now.

383
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,890
I'm not going to be your mother.

384
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

385
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,080
Where did that come from?

386
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,470
Who's that?!

387
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,490
Is it a sex criminal?!

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,660
Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma!

389
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,660
Where were you?!

390
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,310
Didn't you read my email?!

391
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,770
You know I can't turn on that ferkakta computer!

392
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,280
I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter!

393
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,480
Thank you!

394
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,880
Remember to floss after.

395
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,440
We have the dentist in the morning!

396
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,440
Oh, hey. What's up?

397
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,080
I just wanted to check in on you.

398
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,940
Why?

399
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,390
It seems like the appropriate thing to do

400
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,160
when one's best friend finds herself replaced

401
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
by a smart, beautiful woman

402
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,150
with the smoldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.

403
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,340
I already told you, I'm okay with it.

404
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,380
I mean, if anything, I'm quite pleased

405
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,070
that Leonard has found someone

406
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,150
that makes him so happy.

407
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,690
It's okay, it's okay.

408
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,110
Thank you.

409
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,380
Now, let's get these electrodes attached

410
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,740
and see what's going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.

411
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,150
Okay.

412
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,050
I smell Chinese food.

413
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,940
It's actually Thai.

414
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,320
You're slipping.

415
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,200
Are Leonard and Priya here?

416
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,400
They went to Catalina for the weekend.

417
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,660
Oh. Where's Raj?

418
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,650
At home, forbidding it.

419
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,900
How about Howard?

420
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,150
I'm given to understand

421
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,930
his mother grounded him for running away.

422
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,780
Oh, okay.

423
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,110
Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?

424
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,830
Actually, it's the three of us.

425
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,480
What up, bestie?

426
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,500
Good news.

427
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,450
Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry

428
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,610
like a disgraced televangelist.

429
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,730
Great.

430
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,270
So, you feeling better?

431
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,740
Not really.

432
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,190
Sheldon, you have a guest who's upset.

433
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,960
Right. I'll make tea.

434
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,480
Sweetie, it's okay. I don't want tea.

435
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm sorry. It's not optional.
