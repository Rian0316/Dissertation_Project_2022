1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:09,920
Joey.

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,170
Oh my God.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,620
Okay.

4
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,950
So uh…
I guess we should… make it official huh?

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,810
Uh… Look Rach…

6
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,060
Hey Ross is here!

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,750
Hey look! It’s my good friend Ross. Hey Ross.

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,720
Hey Joey.

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,220
Hey you.
Hey you.

10
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,560
Hey and look he brought flowers.
Thanks Ross, but I’m really more of a candy guy.

11
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,630
You’re weird today.

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,810
Listen I uh,
wanted to talk to you about something.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,750
Uh yeah, actually
I kinda need to talk to you too.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,010
Uh Joey,
can you give us just a minute?

15
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,650
No.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,250
What?

17
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,050
Oh, I’m sorry. I meant no.

18
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,260
Hi!

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,010
Hey look who’s here!

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,860
Where’s my granddaughter?
I’ve been practicing my magic tricks.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
He pulled a quarter out of my ear!

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,080
Hey, where’s uh, where’s mom?

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,510
She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,690
Oh, Aunt Liddy’s coming?
That means we get five dollars each!

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,970
So when do I get to meet Emma and show her this?

26
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,160
Okay. Wow.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,040
Uh Dad, Emma’s in the nursery.
I’ll take you now. If you want, but

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,050
I really want to talk to you.

29
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,870
I know, I still need to talk to you.

30
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,680
Oh hey but, before you guys do that
I need to talk to you, and Ross,
I need to talk to you.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,330
Oh and I need to talk to you.

32
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,370
About what?

33
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,660
To see if know what these guys are talking about.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,800
Isn’t she beautiful?

35
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,360
Look at her, my first grandchild.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
What about Ben?

37
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,520
Well of course Ben,
I meant my first granddaughter.

38
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,610
Have umm, have you thought
anymore about you and Rachel?

39
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,660
Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk
to her when you guys all came in the room.

40
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,820
Yay! It’s so exciting!

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,190
Wow, you could’ve done that with us there.

42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,690
Yeah right.

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,550
Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself
in front of us but you can’t talk to Rachel.

44
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:31,960
What?! When have I ever touched
myself in front of you guys?

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,660
Oh please! Just before when you
were asleep in the lounge!

46
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,300
That Armenian family was watching
you instead of the TV.

47
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,940
Oh, that reminds me.
That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.

48
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,470
Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,500
Sure.

50
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,610
Dude I just did something terrible.

51
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,220
That was you?!
I thought it was Jack!

52
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,770
No! No, that was Jack!

53
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,610
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!

54
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,580
What?! Why does she think that?

55
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,820
Because it kinda looked like I did.

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,630
Again, what?!

57
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,130
Okay well, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand…

58
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,880
As we all are at some point during the day.

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,200
It wasn’t my ring! It fell out of Ross’s jacket!
And when I knelt down to pick it up

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,940
Rachel thought I was proposing!

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,260
Ross had a ring?!

62
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,260
And he was gonna propose?
I guess.

63
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,670
And you did it first?!

64
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,980
This is gonna kill him!
You know how much he loves to propose!

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,640
I know! I know it’s awful.

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Well, what did she say?

67
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,480
She said yes.

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,880
Does Ross know?

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,820
Oh God,
what the hell am I going to tell him?

70
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,890
Well maybe you don’t
have to tell him anything.

71
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,600
Oh, I like that. Yeah…

72
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,160
If you clear things up with Rachel
then Ross never needs to find out,

73
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,950
but you have to do it now before
he hears about it and kicks your ass!

74
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,350
Now let’s not get carried away.

75
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,290
I want a baby.

76
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,730
Honey, we’ve been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

77
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,600
Come on! Come on, if we have sex again
it’ll double our chances of getting pregnant.

78
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,980
Do you think that closet’s still available?

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,170
I’m so tired.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,420
Yeah okay, but no foreplay.

81
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,820
Deal!

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,510
Dad seriously!

83
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,850
Y’know you really should see someone about that!

84
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,350
Noted.

85
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,850
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute,
are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

86
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

87
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,510
Actually umm…

88
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,880
Hey!

89
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,820
Hi.

90
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,670
Are you all right?

91
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,540
Uhh… I think I just got engaged.

92
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Oh my God! He did it?

93
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,140
Well… did you know he was gonna ask me?

94
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,920
Are you kidding?
I’m like the one who talked him into it.

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,130
I like to think of myself as
the puppet master of the group.

96
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,010
And you really think this is a good idea?

97
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,350
I just talked him into it,
don’t tell me I have to do you too.

98
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,390
The puppet master gets tired people.

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
I just don’t know!
It just doesn’t feel right.

100
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,010
Why?! You two are so meant to
be together, everybody thinks so.

101
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,260
Really?!

102
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,140
Even Ross?

103
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,980
Especially Ross!

104
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh uh, hey Pheebs.
Uh y’know what?
I’ll-I’ll come back later.

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,260
Wow! Kind of uh,
kind of a full house here.

106
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,290
I’ll guess just… I’ll come back.

107
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,700
There he goes, your fiancée.

108
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,920
I guess so.

109
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,140
Although he does play with himself in his sleep.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,070
I can’t say that I’m surprised.

111
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
Dad, what are you doing?

112
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,040
I think there are people in there having sex.

113
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,380
It can’t be me,
I’m standing right here.

114
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,350
Wanna peek?

115
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,220
No!

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,820
Come on!

117
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,850
Y’know what?
I don’t like you without mom.

118
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,820
Come on.

119
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,820
We’re not peeking?

120
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,160
Well I’m peeking.

121
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh my God!

122
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,790
Hello sir, you know Monica.

123
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,100
Hey uh, is it okay to come in?

124
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,250
Of course!

125
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,010
Oh Joey, this ring I…
it’s beautiful I love it!

126
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,290
Yeah uh look Rach,
there’s something I gotta tell ya.

127
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,540
Hey!

128
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,260
Hey!

129
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,730
Are you ready to try nursing again?

130
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,790
Yeah!

131
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,200
Hi Emma.

132
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,700
Hey, why do you think
she won’t take my breast?

133
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,640
It’s all right honey, it takes some babies
a while to get it, but don’t worry. It’ll happen.

134
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,580
Okay sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

135
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,880
Dear Lord.

136
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,960
I’m sorry honey,
what were you saying?

137
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,840
Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that…

138
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,080
Oh look, she’s pulling away again!

139
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,960
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

140
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,780
She looks scared.
Doesn’t she look scared?

141
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,330
Y’know, I don’t really know her.

142
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,400
Why don’t we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow.

143
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,900
Are you kidding me?!

144
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,340
It’s just so frustrating!
Why doesn’t she want my breast?!

145
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,030
I don’t know!
Maybe she’s crazy!

146
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,880
Oh hey! Wait up!

147
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,030
Hi!

148
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,090
Congratulations!

149
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,030
I didn’t want to say anything in front of Joey
‘cause I didn’t know if he knew yet.

150
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,150
What, that we had a baby?
Come on let’s give him a little credit,

151
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,210
although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

152
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,030
No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!

153
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,150
What?

154
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,700
Oh, it’s a secret. Oh goodie! Yes!
We haven’t done the secret thing in a long time.

155
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,280
Phoebe, there is no secret.
Okay? I didn’t propose.

156
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,640
Are you lying? Is this like that time you
tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

157
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,650
I am a doctor!

158
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Y’know what? I’m just gonna
go and talk to Rachel myself.

159
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,450
All right, me too.

160
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,750
Should we wake her up?

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,960
No! No, come on let her sleep!
She’s so exhausted.

162
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,190
And so engaged.

163
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,590
Oh my God!
She-she thinks we’re engaged!

164
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,900
Why? Why?
Why would she think we’re engaged?!

165
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,070
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

166
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,900
Y’know Ross doctors are
supposed to be smart.

167
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,780
I didn’t give her that ring!

168
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,900
Really?

169
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,580
No!

170
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,340
So whose ring is it?

171
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,650
It’s mine.

172
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,090
Is it an engagement ring?
Yes!

173
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,030
But you didn’t give it to her?

174
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,890
No!

175
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,960
But you were going to propose?

176
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,090
No!!

177
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,400
Huh, I might be losing interest in this.

178
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,200
Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring
because she wanted me to propose to Rachel,

179
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,150
but all I wanted to do is if she maybe…
kinda… wanted ah… start… things up again.

180
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

181
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:29,400
Look, I didn’t want to rush into anything.
And it seemed like she didn’t want to either.
But I don’t, I don’t understand how any of this happened!

182
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,710
What? Did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume that I was going to propose,
throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

183
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,590
No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.

184
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,840
Well I didn’t! I didn’t propose!

185
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,460
Unless uh…

186
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,760
Did I?

187
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,030
I haven’t slept in forty hours and…

188
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,710
it does sound like something I would do.

189
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,400
Look, we can’t stay in here forever.

190
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh, I still can’t believe
my dad saw us having sex!

191
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,950
He didn’t make it to one of
piano recitals, but this he sees!

192
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,030
This is okay. We’re all adults here;
there’s nothing to be ashamed of.

193
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,760
Now, let’s put our underwear in
our pockets and walk out the door.

194
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,570
Hi Dad!

195
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,270
I can still call you that right?

196
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,090
Of course. I’ll always be your dad.

197
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,280
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn’t for fun.

198
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,080
It wasn’t fun?!

199
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,320
Why? Why-why-would you—Wh-why…

200
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,030
Look, I just don’t want you to think that
we’re animals who do it whenever we want.

201
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,960
Oh, I don’t think that. Before today I never
thought of you two having sex at all.

202
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,190
It was a simpler time.

203
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,000
The truth is, Dad, we’re-we’re trying.

204
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,630
What?

205
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,570
Yeah, we’re trying to get pregnant.

206
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,940
Oh my God! This is so exciting!
Well, get back in there!
I’ll guard the door!

207
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,440
Well, that’s okay dad,
we-we can wait until later.

208
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,780
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
I don’t think so! Aren’t you ovulating?

209
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,590
Daddy?!

210
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,710
Well you gotta get at it princess!

211
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:38,880
When your mother and I were trying to conceive you,
whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it.

212
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,090
That’s how I got my bad hip.

213
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,150
That’s funny, this conversation’s
how I got the bullet hole in my head.

214
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,820
This one time I had my knee up on
the sink and your mother, she was…

215
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,460
Daddy! I don’t think we need to hear about
the specific positions you and mom had sex.

216
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,210
You’re right, you’re right.
This is about your positions.

217
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:04,500
Now, what I saw in the closet is not
the optimum position for conceiving a child,
although it might feel good.

218
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,840
I don’t feel good right now.

219
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,710
But pleasure is important, and it
helps if the woman has an orgasm.

220
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,580
You up to the task sailor?

221
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,090
Seriously sir, my brains?
All over the wall.

222
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,380
Hey.

223
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,530
Hey.

224
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,890
I need to tell you something.

225
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,460
Well, now’s a good time.
I’m on my way to have my ears cut off.

226
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,460
Joey asked me marry him.

227
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,840
What?

228
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,210
Joey proposed to me.

229
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:38,590
Is he crazy?!
You just had Ross’s baby!

230
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,590
Well, I-I said yes.

231
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,530
What?! Are you crazy?
You just had Ross’s baby!

232
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:51,010
It’s-it’s so inappropriate.
No, it’s worse than that. It’s wrong.
It’s… It is bigger than mine!

233
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,530
I know. Days of Our Lives,
thank you very much.

234
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,840
You can’t marry him!

235
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:04,210
Why not? I don’t want to do this alone!
And he’s such a sweet guy
and he loves me so much.

236
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,020
Well do you love him?

237
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,030
Sure.

238
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,820
Sure?

239
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,030
Yeah, I mean whatever.

240
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,130
Honey, the question is…
do you really want to marry Joey?

241
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,030
No. No, I don’t.

242
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,640
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

243
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,780
You still haven’t told Rachel
you weren’t really proposing?

244
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,880
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

245
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,580
Joey, you have to tell her what’s
going on! And what did it look like?!

246
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,820
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s
head was blocking most of it.

247
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,690
Go and tell Rachel right now
before Ross finds out.

248
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,280
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted
to marry me. I don’t want to hurt her.

249
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay, look, just do it gently.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,270
You’re right. You’re right. I-I’ll go tell her now
before Ross finds out and I’ll be gentle.
I can do that.

251
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:18,150
I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way.
Two people screwing in there
if you want to check that out.

252
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,150
Hey.

253
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,020
Hey.

254
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,190
Listen, I um…
I heard about the engagement.

255
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,330
Surprised?

256
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,000
And confused.

257
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,460
Rach, sweetie, I-I um…
I didn’t propose to you.

258
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,070
I know.

259
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,880
I don’t think you do.

260
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,960
You didn’t propose to me.
Joey did.

261
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,920
Poor baby, you’re so tired.

262
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,430
Rach, I didn’t propose to you,

263
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,310
Joey didn’t propose to you,

264
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,930
and Chandler didn’t propose to you.

265
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,540
Uh… You didn’t propose to me,
Chandler didn’t propose to me,

266
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,140
but Joey did.

267
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,930
Joey proposed to you?

268
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,930
I can come back.

269
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,180
Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait!
Joey, did you propose to her?

270
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,750
No.

271
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,680
Yes you did!

272
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,810
Actually, technically, I didn’t.

273
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,880
Well then why did you give me a ring?

274
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:58,290
Wait! Whoa-whoa,
you… you gave her the ring?

275
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,560
No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!

276
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
Yes, you did!

277
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,310
No, I didn’t!

278
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:03,930
Yes, you did!

279
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,430
No, I didn’t!

280
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:06,930
Yes, you did!
And don’t you say, you didn’t!

281
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,560
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and proposed.

282
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,310
Whoa! You were down on one knee?

283
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,810
Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad.
But I didn’t…

284
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,930
I didn’t propose!

285
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,560
Then what did happen?

286
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,810
Yeah, what did happen?

287
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:27,560
Okay, the ring fell on the floor and
I went down to pick it up
and you thought I was proposing.

288
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,060
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

289
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,310
No, I didn’t!

290
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,250
Yes, you did!

291
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:34,930
No, I didn’t!

292
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,180
Yes, you did—Oh my God you didn’t!

293
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,660
Well then why didn’t you tell me that before?!

294
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,560
Well I tried, but people kept coming in
and then you took your breast out!

295
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,630
Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa,
you saw her breast?!

296
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:59,270
I’ll tell you about it later.
Be cool.

297
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,560
Well then Joey, what the hell were
you doing with an engagement ring?!

298
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:11,930
It wasn’t my ring! It’s Ross’s ring!
That’s why I felt so bad Rach,
because he was going to propose.

299
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,560
What?!

300
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,930
You were gonna propose to me?

301
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,310
Uhh… No.

302
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,810
Well, this is awkward.

303
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:46,310
But I-I was going to see if y’know,
maybe you uh, start dating again but
that—I mean that-that was all, Rach.

304
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,910
Dude, step up! I proposed.

305
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,650
No, you didn’t!

306
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,880
Oh that’s right. There’s a lot going on here
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

307
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,310
Hey,

308
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
she just woke up! She’s hungry.

309
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,930
Why don’t we give this another try?
Okay.

310
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,810
I can’t believe you told her I was going to propose!

311
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,630
I can’t believe you’re not going to propose!

312
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,800
Hey, I’m not going to rush into anything!

313
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,060
Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand.
Usually after I have a baby with
a woman I like to slow things down!

314
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,000
Oh my God!

315
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:20,560
What?

316
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,430
She’s doing it Look,
she’s breast-feeding look!

317
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,560
Ah, it’s beautiful.

318
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:27,270
I’ll come back for her later.

319
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,310
Okay.
Thank you.

320
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,380
Oh wow, this feels weird.

321
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,280
Good weird?

322
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,250
Wonderful weird.

323
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:45,790
Y’know what you guys?
I’m uh, I’m gonna go too.
And uh, I’m sorry about everything.

324
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,930
Honey don’t worry,
it was my mistake.

325
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:53,800
No, Rach, I should’ve told you sooner.
It’s just that… Man! That kid is going to town!

326
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,680
She’s perfect.

327
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,010
We’re so lucky.

328
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,780
We really are.

329
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:31,430
Look, I-I know it’s not a proposal
and I don’t know where you are, but with everything
that’s been going on and with Emma and…

330
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,180
I’ve been feeling…

331
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,310
I know. I know. I’ve feeling…

332
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,930
Yeah?

333
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,060
Yeah.

334
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,810
Okay, well, that… Wow, okay, well,
umm… then maybe, at least we can,
we can talk about us again.

335
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,910
Yeah, maybe.

336
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,180
Well good, okay.
I-I, kind of think y’know if we…if…

337
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,380
You’re wearing the ring.

338
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,560
Wh-what’s that?

339
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,400
And you told Phoebe you were engaged.

340
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,180
I’m sorry, what?

341
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:29,410
When you thought Joey proposed
did… did you say yes?

342
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,880
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
this pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

343
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,680
Hey dad!

344
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,290
Hey.

345
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:59,430
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

346
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,430
Thank you.
