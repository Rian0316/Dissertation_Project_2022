你们想喝点什么吗
Can I get you guys anything to drink?

14
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,280
-苏格兰威士忌  纯的  -厄运结
- Scotch, neat. - Jinx.

15
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,350
我的...  老天
Oh, my... God.

16
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:16,110
<i>孩子们  你们可能难以理解为什么五个</i>
<i>Kids, you may be wondering why five adults</i>

17
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,100
<i>30多岁的成年人会对"厄运结"如此在意</i>
<i>in their 30s would take a jinx so seriously.</i>

18
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>这都源于五年前的一天</i>
<i>It all started one day five years ago.</i>

19
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,390
哦  范海辛[电影名]
Ooh, Van Helsing.

20
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,840
"厄运结"  你被下咒了
Jinx. You're jinxed.

21
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,530
所以从此刻起  你不能说一句话
That means that you can't speak until someone

22
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,910
直到目睹了厄运结之人说出你的姓名
who was present for the jinx says your name, or else

23
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,030
不然你就等着突遭横祸吧
you will have very bad luck.

24
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,710
简直是无稽之谈
That's ridiculous.

25
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,930
你把"厄运结"打破了
You broke the jinx.

26
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,850
马修  我是一个成熟的男人
Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man.

27
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,850
我还是公司的联合董事会成员
I'm on my building's co-op board.

28
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,340
当我说黑比诺红酒加上少许大黄  
When I say a Pinot Noir tastes

29
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,890
这样品起来既奢华又不失泥土的芳香  
luxuriously earthy with a hint of rhubarb,

30
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,380
我可不是胡诌的哦
I'm not faking it.

31
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:41,340
大黄是可食用的植物

32
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,480
我有不少床伴
I've had several

33
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,860
之前可都是基辛格的枕边人
of the same sexual partners as Henry Kissinger.

34
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,860
美国前国务卿

35
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,450
小小"厄运结"休想让我闭嘴
I'm not about to stop talking just because I was jinxed.

36
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,800
晚些时候

37
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,160
<i>巴尼断了三根肋骨和两根脊椎骨</i>
<i>Barney broke three limbs and two vertebrae,</i>

38
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,890
<i>但"厄运结"  他再也不敢打破了</i>
<i>but he never broke another jinx.</i>

39
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,030
<i>事实上  他开始对"厄运结"走火入魔</i>
<i>In fact, he started taking jinxes way too seriously.</i>

40
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,730
巴尼  我打通了体育电台
Barney, I'm on hold with Sports Talk AM

41
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,040
要跟儿时明尼苏达双城队中的偶像通电话啦
to talk to my childhood hero from the Minnesota Twins.

42
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,040
明尼苏达的棒球队

43
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,180
你的儿时偶像是谁啊
Who's your childhood hero?

44
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,880
-弗兰克・瓦奥拉[棒球明星]  -厄运结
- Frank Viola. Frank Viola - Jinx!

45
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,280
你好  我是弗兰克
Hello, this is Frank.

46
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,060
有人吗
Anyone there?

47
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,140
你好
Hello?

48
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,830
都听见你喘息声了  你个胆小鬼
I can hear you breathing, you coward.

49
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,300
<i>所以当多年之后终于有人</i>
<i>So, when someone finally jinxed Barney</i>

50
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,620
<i>给巴尼下了"厄运结"的咒</i>
<i>for the first time in years,</i>

51
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,870
<i>我们都超级兴奋</i>
<i>we were pretty psyched.</i>

52
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,280
恐怖魔王的统治结束啦
The reign of terror is over!

53
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,490
这根雪茄在我口袋里等了两年
I've had this cigar in my pocket for two years,

54
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,750
只为此刻
waiting for this moment.

55
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,730
两年前味道应该更好
Aw, that would've been good about two years ago.

56
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,300
干杯
Cheers.

57
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,020
好嘞  好嘞
Huzzah! Huzzah.

58
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,040
你这是想让我们说出你的名字
Oh, oh, oh, you want us to say your name

59
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,380
帮你解开"厄运结"吗
and un-jinx you?

60
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,250
想得美  老哥
I don't think so, pal.

61
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,530
这个"厄运结"要维持很久呢
This is gonna be a long jinx.

62
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,630
就像犹太赎罪日一样长[25小时]
Like Yom Kippur services long.

63
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,860
唯一的区别是  赎罪日得斋戒[很快]
The only difference is, Yom Kippur's a fast

64
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,490
而你的"厄运结"可要度日如年啦
and this one's gonna be a slow.

65
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,290
泰德
Now, Ted,

66
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,470
可否帮个忙来给我详细解释说一下
I was wondering if you could expand upon what you were saying

67
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,670
你之前提到的老钱币
earlier about antiquated currency.

68
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,050
对  对  对
Ah, yes, yes.

69
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,770
与普遍的认知恰恰相反
Contrary to popular belief,

70
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,400
早期五分镍币上的野牛是取材于
the buffalo nickel was modeled on

71
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,350
一头名叫"黑钻石"的野牛
the Black Diamond bison

72
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,800
而不是更具代表性的西部平原野牛
rather than the more iconic Western Plains bison.

73
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,220
换句话说
To wit,

74
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,090
如果塔夫脱总统也这么来的话
if President Taft had had his way,

75
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,010
五分镍币上就要印白鹭了
we'd all be talking about the egret nickel.

76
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,010
美国第27任总统  鸟类保护主义者

77
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,030
<i>2012年的冬天</i>
<i>In the winter of 2012 </i>

78
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,850
<i>我设计的摩天大楼就要投入使用了</i>
<i>the skyscraper that I designed was about to open,</i>

79
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,190
<i>这也不禁让我想起一位对我</i>
<i>which got me thinking about the most influential</i>

80
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,480
<i>影响最深的建筑学教授</i>
<i>architecture professor I ever had.</i>

81
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,520
所以每当我们孙子的孙子问我们
So when the children of our grandchildren's children

82
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
"我们是何许人也"时  
ask us "who were we,"

83
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,870
他们能在我们设计的建筑物
they'll find the answer carved

84
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,280
那块用花岗岩雕刻的诗篇中找到答案
into the granite poetry of our architecture.

85
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,210
好啦
Okay.

86
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,740
没有比这更棒的了
It doesn't get any better than that.

87
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,220
下课
Class dismissed.

88
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,580
太...  令人赞叹了
Wow, just wow.

89
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,740
有什么能帮你的吗
Do you need something?

90
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,410
我有个苹果
I have an apple

91
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,090
想着安安静静地吃
I was hoping to eat in silence.

92
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,010
好的  维尼克教授  我...
Of course, Professor Vinick, I, um,

93
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,800
我画了一份设计图
I-I sketched out a design,

94
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,030
你如果能过目一下就再好不过了
and it'd be such an honor if you took a look at it.

95
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,240
那好吧
Oh, well.

96
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,600
传言中
It is believed

97
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,430
法老们花了一百多年的时间
that it took the pharaohs over 100 years

98
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,000
才建起狮身人面像
to build the Sphinx.

99
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,180
那么
So...

100
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,590
你的意思是...
you think...

101
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,700
我该再多花点时间吗
I should spend more time on it?

102
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,930
我的老天  千万别
Oh, dear God, no.

103
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,140
这作品烂透了
This is terrible.

104
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,660
那你干嘛要提狮身人面像
Then, why'd you mention the Sphinx?

105
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,600
我的思绪常飘到狮身人面像上
I find my mind is often with the Sphinx.

106
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,180
话说回来  你永远也成不了建筑师
Anyway, you'll never be an architect.

107
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,530
你永远也成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect.

108
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,630
你永远也成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect.

109
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,020
你永远也成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect!

110
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,170
你们猜怎么着
Well, guess what.

111
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,390
我给维尼克教授寄了
I sent Professor Vinick

112
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,340
我大楼开幕仪式的请帖
the invitation to the opening of my building,

113
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,380
让他看看我真的成为了一名建筑师
so he'll see that I did become an architect,

114
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,350
我也原谅他那些小气伤人的话了
and that I've moved past his petty, hurtful words.

115
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,510
都过去十五年了  你还耿耿于怀
Wow. 15 years later and you're still this obsessed.

116
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,370
如果维尼克教授无故失踪
Yeah, if Vinick ever goes missing,

117
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,490
警察绝对直奔你家地下室去找
the cops are gonna come looking for him in your basement.

118
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,170
绝对的  他就是泰德的"井底之囚" 
Totally, he's Ted's pit guy.

119
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,820
你胆敢再乱说一句
How dare you?

120
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,370
还有那是啥意思
And what is that?

121
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,920
"井底之囚"就是那个
A pit guy is someone

122
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,070
让你耿耿于怀了许久
you've been obsessed with for so long...

123
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,020
让你发疯到一定程度的人
that it's driven you crazy enough

124
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,000
以至于你会把他们扔进地下室的井里
to throw them in a pit in your basement

125
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,980
就像电影《沉默的羔羊》里那样
like in The Silence of the Lambs.

126
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,030
我不会对他下此狠手的
I'm not gonna Silence of the Lambs him.

127
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,700
顶多我会学电影《菜鸟大反攻》那样
At most, I'd Revenge of the Nerds him.

128
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,940
虽然我觉得他同意
Though I don't see a scenario

129
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,810
和我进行五项全能这种桥段  压根不会上演
where he agrees to play me in a pentathlon.

130
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,940
我同意泰德
Yeah, I'm with Ted--

131
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,780
我实在是找不到一个让我
there is no one I hate enough

132
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,660
恨到要将其"囚于井底"的人
to throw into a pit.

133
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,460
干嘛
What?

134
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,170
<i>当罗宾最看不顺眼的同事帕特里斯</i>
<i>When Robin's most hated coworker Patrice</i>

135
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,750
<i>和巴尼开始约会时</i>
<i>started dating Barney,</i>

136
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,220
<i>她一直耿耿于怀</i>
<i>she became obsessed.</i>

137
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:48,110
帕特里斯  她绝对是你的"井底之囚"
Patrice, Patrice goes in your pit.

138
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,390
我都跟你们说了
Guys, I told you,

139
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,770
我对帕特里斯早就释怀了
I am done obsessing about Patrice.

140
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,040
她的事就丢一边吧
Just drop her.

141
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,940
-是把她丢进"井底"吧  -你够了
- Drop her in a pit. - Enough.

142
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,670
每人心中都有自己想丢入井底的人
We all have people that we would throw in our pits,

143
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,690
我也相信  肯定有人
and I'm sure we all have people

144
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,360
也想把我们丢进他们的"井"里
who would like to throw us in their pits.

145
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,450
对  如果马修或者我失踪了
Yeah, if Marshall or I ever go missing,

146
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,640
我告诉你们该去谁的地下室找
I'll tell you whose basement to look in.

147
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,500
达里尔・拉库尔特
Daryl LaCourte.

148
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,410
不
Oh, no.

149
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,350
是疯子达里尔
It's creepy Daryl.

150
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,630
趁他没看见我们  赶快走
Let's get out of here before he sees us.

151
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,650
烫手沙包  快接
Hey, hot sack coming through.

152
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,860
好啊  达里尔 
Hi, Daryl.

153
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,940
感觉好久没见到你们了呢
I feel like I never see you guys anymore.

154
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,300
每次我去参加派对  你们都正好要走
Like whenever I'm getting to a party, you're just leaving.

155
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,850
即使是办在你家的派对
Even that party at your place--

156
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,550
你们也是七点半就不见人影了
you guys just raced off into the night at 7:30.

157
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,750
太奇怪了
That's weird.

158
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,000
不过这下好了
But this is great--

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
沙包三剑客重聚首
the three hackmigos back together again.

160
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,470
达里尔  我们就大一时一起玩过一次沙包球
We played Hacky Sack together once freshman year, Daryl.

161
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,100
只玩过一次
Once.

162
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,690
1996年11月14号
November 14, 1996.

163
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,190
我人生中最棒的回忆
That is the best memory ever.

164
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,080
当然
Sure.

165
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,420
一辈子的沙包三剑客
The three hackmigos for life.

166
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,940
我们至今还会收到他寄来的电邮和卡片
To this day, we are still getting e-mails and posts from Daryl.

167
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,460
我们上传的所有小马文的照片
He has commented on every photo

168
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,700
他每一张都会评论
of Baby Marvin we have ever posted,

169
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,760
然后
and then

170
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,700
瞧瞧你们的沙包球球
哈大笑玩包
边哈哈大笑边在玩沙包

171
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,680
他还要评论自己的评论
he comments on his own comments.

172
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,940
各位  瞧  是巴...
Hey, guys, look, it's Bar...

173
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,420
没门  全世界我最爱的
none, my favorite non-speaking

174
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,320
中咒倒霉蛋
jinxed person in the world.

175
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,470
你今天过得如何啊
How was your day?

176
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,000
我来告诉你们我今天的遭遇

177
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,180
你们这群混蛋

178
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,500
我花了一个小时

179
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,110
也没能给司机说清楚我要去哪里

180
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,790
所以我因为迟到被大骂一顿

181
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,460
他们问周末谁没空来上班

182
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,250
我却什么也不能说

183
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,840
这就是我的周末

184
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,550
以万能的真命天女组合之名 
almighty destiny's child

185
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,550
求求你们了

186
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,950
说我的名字

187
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,340
说我的名字

188
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,120
啊哦  我完全没懂他在说啥
Yeah, I didn't get a word of that.

189
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,460
对不起  兄弟
Sorry, buddy.

190
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,930
特布罗斯基  这是我一年中最喜欢的时刻
Ah, Scherbatsky, it's my favorite time of year.

191
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,460
我不知道你这么喜欢圣诞节
Didn't know you liked Christmas so much.

192
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,410
不  我说的是年终总结
No, year-end reviews.

193
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,130
我们可以炒人呢
We get to fire some people.

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,610
快跟我一起开心
Get into the spirit.

195
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,500
桑迪  你可能很享受因微小的个人分歧
Look, Sandy, you might enjoy firing people

196
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,640
而炒人鱿鱼的事
for petty personal differences.

197
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,630
把性病传染给我
I'd hardly call giving me gonorrhea

198
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,840
可不是什么微小的个人分歧
a petty personal difference.

199
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,640
蛋我可是专业人士
But I am a professional,

200
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,230
我不会因不专业的原因解雇员工
and I would never fire someone for unprofessional reasons.

201
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,010
反正一定得有人被炒就是了
Well, somebody's got to go.

202
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,390
<i>孩子们  有时"井底之囚"</i>
<i>Kids, the thing about pit people,</i>

203
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,410
<i>是得等你有机会把他们推进去时</i>
<i>sometimes you don't even know you have one</i>

204
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,470
<i>你才会意识到有这么一个人</i>
<i>until you have a chance to push 'em in.</i>

205
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,710
罗宾
Hi, Robin.

206
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,730
想都别想  兄弟
Not happening, bro.

207
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,010
想都别想  兄弟
Not happening, bro.

208
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,570
手酸了吗
Hand get tired?

209
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,520
想都别想  兄弟
Not happening, bro.

210
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,850
我手里拿的是
I hold in my hand

211
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,550
维尼克教授的回函
the RSVP from Professor Vinick.

212
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,140
他选了"不会出席"那一项  不过没事
Ah, he's checked "Will not attend," which is fine,

213
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,770
只要他知道有这么一回事就行了
because all I needed to know was that he knows.

214
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,640
现在这回函我扔了也行  不用再看了
So now I will throw this in the trash and never look at it.

215
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,670
她谢了什么
What's this?

216
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,490
"你肯定寄错了人"
"I believe you've sent this to the wrong person.

217
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,420
"我不认识泰德・莫斯比"
I have no idea who Ted Mosby is."

218
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,910
你会记起我的  维尼克教授
Oh, you'll remember who I am, Professor Vinick.

219
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,880
你绝不会忘记
You'll never forget it.

220
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,130
想都别想  兄弟
Not happening, bro.

221
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,550
泰德  我们和你一起去卫斯理大学
Ted, just because we're coming with you to Wesleyan

222
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,300
并不意味着我们接受你的行为
does not mean that we condone your behavior.

223
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,900
我们只是当做来重游母校
Just using it as an excuse to see the old campus...

224
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,460
以及避免错过看你精神彻底崩溃的机会
and maybe watch you have a complete mental breakdown.

225
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:15,050
你见到维尼克教授之后  打算干嘛
What are you even gonna do when you see Professor Vinick?

226
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,650
容我细细道来
Oh, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

227
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,960
我的弗兰克・ 盖里和弗兰克・劳埃德・赖特啊
Sweet merciful Franks Gehry and Lloyd Wright,

228
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,960
两者皆为著名建筑师

229
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,030
这是出自哪位大师之手的神作啊
from what brilliant mind was this work of art sired?

230
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,350
莫斯比
Mosby.

231
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,170
泰德・莫斯比
Ted Mosby.

232
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,790
建筑师
Architect.

233
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,390
但这  这...
But that's-that's...

234
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,420
不可能吗
Impossible?

235
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,470
看来你当年看错了  维尼克
Looks like you were wrong, Vinick.

236
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,540
罪该万死的大错
Dead wrong.

237
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,020
不
No!

238
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,050
注意点  泰德
Be careful, Ted.

239
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,990
复仇美梦往往不会成真
Revenge fantasies never work out the way you want.

240
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,420
尤其是跟跳舞有关的复仇
Especially dance-based revenge.

241
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,110
我的毕业舞会一把辛酸泪啊
My prom was rough, guys.

242
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,920
我们就快到了
Ooh! We're almost there.

243
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,130
我等不及想看看母校了
Oh, I can't wait to see the old campus.

244
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,080
我要去吃食堂的巨型热狗
I'm gonna grab one of those giant dining hall hot dogs.

245
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,880
我爱死那个大香肠了
Oh, I love those huge wieners.

246
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,140
你好像没听清楚啊
I'm not so sure you heard me.

247
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,380
我说  我爱死"大香肠"了
I said, "I love those huge wieners."

248
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,360
我喜欢得不得了
I love them.

249
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,720
喜欢放自己嘴里
In my mouth.

250
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,080
问你几个问题  克拉丽斯...帕特里斯
So, let me ask you a few questions, Clarice... Patrice.

251
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,080
克拉丽斯  《沉默的羔羊》女主角

252
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,690
你给这半年来自己的表现
How would you rate your performance

253
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,460
打多少分
in the last six months?

254
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,350
我不喜欢讨论自己
Well, I don't like to talk about myself,

255
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,200
但是我的同事们都应该得超超优
but all my coworkers deserve an A-double-plus,

256
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,620
那是肯定的
that's for suresies.

257
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,410
高档的乳液
Fancy lotion.

258
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,990
这牌子乳液都放篮子里呢
It puts the lotion in the basket.

259
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,430
这乳液真的特别好
It's just, this is really nice lotion.

260
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,450
这篮子也很好看  罗宾
And what a pretty basket, Robin.

261
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,860
我知道  所以我才买啊  帕特里斯
I know, that's why I bought it, Patrice!

262
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,070
-天啊  感觉一切都没变  -对啊
- Oh, man, it's like nothing has changed. - Mmm, I know.

263
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,190
小面包  佐料
The bun, the relish.

264
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,170
那是个膝盖
That's a knee.

265
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,780
画得很棒的膝盖[尼]  所以呢
It's a beautifully drawn knee, so?

266
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,870
这是谷仓[巴]
That's a barn.

267
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,630
原来是膝盖仓库[尼巴]啊
Oh, knee barn, right.

268
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,700
真是个好主意  莉莉
That's a great idea, Lily.

269
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,170
回家路上  我们应该在膝盖谷仓停一下
On the way home, we should stop at the knee barn,

270
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,300
-买点批发的膝盖  -没错
- pick us up some wholesale knees. - Yeah.

271
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,600
马修  莉莉
Marshall? Lily!

272
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,690
你们...你们来了
You... you're here.

273
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,230
-你好啊  达里尔  -你好啊  达里尔
- Hi, Daryl. - Hi, Daryl.

274
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,330
你们也好啊
Hi.

275
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,880
过了这么多年
After all these years.

276
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,660
你们跟我画的样子都还一模一样
You look just like you do in my paintings.

277
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,570
来抱抱啊  你们俩
Come here, guys.

278
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,800
世上有人  亦有神
There are men and there are gods.

279
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,930
安东尼・高迪[建筑师]  是人神合一
Antoni Gaudi Was both.

280
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,150
世上有蠢人和贱人
There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.

281
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,280
维尼克教授  是蠢贱合一
Professor Vinick was both.

282
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,760
这句真妙啊  泰德
Good one, Ted.

283
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,050
快点  维尼克  让我有机会开场
Come on, Vinick, give me an opening.

284
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,470
高迪的建筑表达出
Gaudi's architecture gave expression

285
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,520
自然界无规律的几何形状
to the anarchic geometric form of nature.

286
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,670
"高迪的建筑风格"
"Gaudi's architecture..."

287
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,120
其实这点还真不错呢
Actually, that's a really good point.

288
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,390
维尼克教授 *
* Wow, Professor Vinick

289
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,580
你让我受益良多 *
* Man, you taught me so much

290
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,660
无论是建筑还是人生 *
* About architecture and life

291
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,430
你的课酷毙了 *
* God, your lectures are so cool

292
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,500
我要让你刮目相看  并与你成为至交 *
* I'll earn your respect and we'll be best friends.

293
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,630
没有比这更棒的了
Okay, it doesn't get any better than that.

294
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,840
的确是没更棒的了
No, it doesn't.

295
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,720
你在这里干什么  达里尔
What are you doing here, Daryl?

296
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,860
我就住在这条街上
Well, I live right down the street.

297
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,160
可我就在这里工作
But I work right here.

298
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,460
天啊
Whoa. Oh, boy.

299
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,390
沙包三剑客

300
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,470
那些是...
Are those...

301
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,180
照着我们的脸画的吗  伙计
...our, our faces up there, buddy?

302
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,440
那还用问
Hack, yeah!

303
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,250
不是我们共同想出的
It was just as much your idea as mine

304
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,730
在卫斯理大学开一家沙包球店的主意吗
to open up a Hacky Sack store here at Wesleyan.

305
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,820
所以你从没离开过这里啊
So you never left?

306
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,190
就离开过一次  我在广告网上认识个女孩
Once. I met a girl on Craigslist,

307
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,950
然后飞去波士顿见她
and I flew to Boston to meet her.

308
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,810
结果她是个男人  体重300磅  还把我给抢了
She was a man, 300 pounds, and robbed me.

309
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,310
不过那仍是我生命中最美好的一晚
Still, the best night of my life.

310
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,700
不过现在不是了
Until now!

311
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,980
我们沙包三剑客又聚一起了
The three hackmigos back together again!

312
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,470
我一直等着给你们点东西  等了好久好久
You know, I've been waiting forever to give you something.

313
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,510
你们跟我回家
You're coming with me to my house,

314
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,270
不许拒绝我哦
and I'm not taking no for an answer.

315
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,040
兄弟  你的机会来了
Dude, this is your chance.

316
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,300
快帮我解咒  我会帮你摆脱这场恶心的噩梦
Set me free, and I will lie you out of this creepy nightmare.

317
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,700
真难抉择
This is a tough one.

318
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,790
一方面  我们可能会送命
On the one hand, we might die.

319
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,540
另一方面  你被下咒了
On the other, you're jinxed.

320
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,190
帮我解咒  马修
Let me free, Marshall.

321
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,450
这家伙可能会施暴哦
This guy could be violent.

322
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,550
施暴  瓦奥拉[音似]
Violent... Viola...

323
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,580
弗兰克・瓦奥拉
Frank Viola.

324
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,000
我们非常乐意去你家  达里尔
We would love to come to your house, Daryl!

325
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,140
真好
Yeah!

326
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,880
好
Okay, um...

327
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,710
你和巴尼多久做一次
how often are you and Barney doing it?

328
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,230
这个问题怪怪的  罗宾
That's a strange question, Robin.

329
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,580
没错
You're right.

330
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,830
或许我该走了
Maybe I should leave.

331
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,010
对  或许你是该走了
Yeah, maybe you should.

332
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,650
你被解雇了
You're fired.

333
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,300
太...  令人赞叹了
Wow. Just wow.

334
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,390
我叫泰德・莫斯比  你以前的学生
Ted Mosby. I'm a former student of yours.

335
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,100
我真的成为一名建筑师了
You know, I actually became an architect.

336
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,100
你对我有印象吗
Any chance you remember me?

337
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,110
请见谅  我教了20年书
Oh, please excuse me, I've been teaching for over 20 years.

338
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,520
大家的脸我都分不清了
All the faces start to blend together

339
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,980
除非你长着很奇怪的胡子或别的
unless you have a, a weird mustache or, or something.

340
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,360
我大一那年试着留胡子
Junior year I tried to grow muttonchops,

341
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,150
可大家一直说我的脸太恶心了
but people kept saying my face made them nauseous.

342
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,140
其实不是大家  是你
Well, not people. You.

343
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:37,410
总之  我希望你能赏脸
Anyway, I would be honored if you,

344
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,300
看看我设计的大楼
if you took a look at my building.

345
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,780
这大楼
This...

346
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,860
真丑
is hideous.

347
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,300
你永远成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect.

348
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,380
你永远成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect.

349
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,750
你永远成不了建筑师  你永远成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect. You'll never be an architect!

350
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,850
你永远成不了建筑师
You'll never be an architect.

351
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,810
等等  我搞错了
Wait. I was mistaken.

352
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,590
你绝对会成为一名出色的建筑师
You most definitely will be an architect.

353
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,500
真的吗
Really?

354
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,770
这简直是惊人之作
These are astonishing,

355
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,270
八字胡皮特
Handlebar Pete.

356
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,900
所以你说的"你家里的惊喜"
So, when you said "surprise in your house,"

357
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,080
实际上指的是  "你家灯光微弱
what you really meant was "surprise in the poorly lit

358
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,120
没装窗户的地下室里的惊吓"吗
windowless basement of your house."

359
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,780
你们一定会喜欢我为你们准备的惊喜
Oh, you guys are gonna love what I have to show you.

360
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,390
我无比激动  都想号啕大哭 
I am so excited, I could just cry

361
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,550
然后放声大笑  大声尖叫
and laugh and scream

362
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,090
再不停地锤墙  
and just punch the wall over and over

363
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,830
一而再再而三地锤
and over and over and over!

364
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,650
我们能不能
Could we just see it,

365
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,690
去楼上客厅看啊
like, up in the living room

366
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,990
或者去不那么阴森的地方看
or anywhere less... gimp-storagey?

367
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,130
我刚意识到
I just realized

368
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,500
我想拍照留念
I want to take a picture of this.

369
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,890
我想把你们的脸放在壁炉架上  像战利品那样
I want to put your faces on my mantel like a trophy.

370
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,300
我的战利品
Like a trophy!

371
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,010
我来了
Here I come.

372
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,410
不  我们不想要你的惊喜  达里尔
No! We don't want your surprise, Daryl!

373
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:02,610
我们不是你的朋友
We're not your amigos,

374
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,710
我们更不是你的沙包剑客
we're definitely not your hackmigos.

375
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,840
在你谋杀我们之前
And before you murder us,

376
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,170
你应该知道我们还有个孩子
you should know that we have a child!

377
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,380
他估计都有八九个孩子了
He probably has eight or nine!

378
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,850
什么  谋杀
What? Murder?

379
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,750
我是想给你们一张支票
I wanted to give you a check.

380
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,730
10万块支票
For $100,000...

381
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,120
毕竟沙包三剑客是我们一起想出的点子
for coming up with the idea of the Three Hackmigos with me.

382
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,510
我把你们带到这来  是想展示下我的存货
I brought you down here to show you all my inventory.

383
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,840
生意好得不行
Business has really exploded.

384
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,830
我就像是乐队演出与停车场运动
I mean, I'm sort of the Mark Zuckerberg

385
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,480
项目上的马克・扎克伯格[Facebook创始人]
of jam-band concert parking lot athletics.

386
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,040
不过等一下
Well, second.

387
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,920
但你逃不掉的  杂耍魔鬼棍阿荣
But I'm coming for you, Devil Stick Ron.

388
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,880
你为什么要解雇我
Why would you fire me?

389
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,150
因为没有人该活得像你一样开心
Because nobody should be as happy as you are.

390
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,730
还有你的饼干  也仅仅是还不赖而已
And also your cookies... they're only pretty good.

391
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:02,430
罗宾  真是因为我的工作吗
Robin, is this really about me?

392
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,490
不  不是
No, it's not.

393
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,960
"炒了再上"的老戏码啊
The old "fire and bang."

394
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,050
向你致敬  特布罗斯基
Respect, Scherbatsky.

395
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,670
很不错吧  对吗  八字胡皮特
Pretty good, right? Right, Handlebar Pete?

396
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,450
你蓄着那迷人的小胡子挺占便宜的啊
Ah, you got it easy with that sweet, sweet 'stache.

397
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,850
泰德  我看见你拿着你大楼的小模型
Hey, Ted, I see you're holding a little version of your building

398
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,320
对陌生人大吼大叫
and yelling at strangers.

399
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,040
我猜你复仇十分"顺利"吧
So I assume it all worked out?

400
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,540
我是想到  既然我在一座
I realized, since I work in a

401
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,800
三维立体的建筑里工作
three-dimensional medium,

402
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,230
那真正能在维尼克面前展示的方式
the only way to really stick it to Vinick would be

403
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,900
应该是用三维立体模型
with a three-dimensional model.

404
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,090
无论你怎么做  不要在进场的时候
Whatever you do, don't march in there

405
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:44,680
想着"我要表演虫舞
thinking, "I'm gonna do the worm.

406
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,270
肯定轰动全场"
That'll show 'em!"

407
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,870
说真的  各位
Seriously, guys,

408
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,770
当年我舞会的惨痛教训不得不再三提醒啊
I can't stress enough how bad my prom was.

409
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,750
说起当年...
Speaking of the past...

410
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,360
我们简直像白痴一样  对不起
Wow, we feel like idiots. We're sorry.

411
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,480
老实说  没关系
You know, honestly, it's fine.

412
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,010
看看我现在多意气风发
Look how great I'm doing.

413
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,940
看看我取得的成就  我不需要
Look at what I've built. I don't need

414
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,410
获得什么大学同学的认可
the validation of some people from college

415
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,130
来肯定自己
to feel good about myself.

416
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,920
我的人生棒极了
My life is amazing!

417
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,100
我跟P-放克乐队一起拥有
I own a timeshare

418
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,040
圣巴兹岛别墅的分时享用权
in St. Barts with P-Funk!

419
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,270
-跟整支乐队吗  -对啊
- The, the whole band? - Yeah.

420
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,800
你们会一起玩音乐吗
Do you guys jam?

421
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,010
玩个不停啊
That's all we do.

422
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,740
你们彻底拒绝了
So, you completely rejected

423
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,730
一个对你们念念不忘
the guy who's been obsessing

424
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,020
长达16年的人  而他就这么算了吗
about you for 16 years, and he was okay with it?

425
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:31,860
疯子达里尔比我更能调整自己的情绪啊
Is creepy Daryl more emotionally adjusted than I am?

426
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,570
<i>孩子们  人生有些时候</i>
<i>Kids, sometimes in life</i>

427
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,110
<i>你会在脑中为某人挖一座井</i>
<i>you'll make a pit for someone in your mind.</i>

428
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,900
<i>但最后  唯一在井里的那个人只会是自己</i>
<i>But ultimately the only person in that pit is yourself.</i>

429
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,830
对不起
I'm sorry.

430
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,520
只是看见你和巴尼在一起
Just seeing you with Barney has brought up

431
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,950
让我想起了一些往事
some old feelings, and I...

432
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,070
我真的不喜欢多愁善感
I really don't like feelings.

433
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,430
但这不是你的错  或巴尼的错
But that's not your fault or Barney's fault.

434
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,260
只是看见你跟他在一起  真的很难受
It's just really hard seeing you with him.

435
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,800
<i>这意味着只有一个人</i>
<i>Which means there's only one person</i>

436
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,120
<i>能将你从井里解救出去</i>
<i>who can let you out of the pit.</i>

437
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,660
你炒了帕特里斯吗
So you fired Patrice?

438
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,860
不  她留下
No, she's staying.

439
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,950
我们走吧  大伙们
Let's get out of here, guys.

440
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,120
莫斯比先生
Oh, Mr. Mosby.

441
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,560
你给自己的大楼建了模型
You built a model of your building.

442
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,130
没有
No.

443
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,860
为什么  为了证明什么吗
Why? To prove some sort of point?

444
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,900
真是可悲
This is just sad.

445
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,530
不不  我刚打算要把它扔了呢
No, no, I was just throwing it out.

446
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,940
是啊  谁信啊
Sure, you were.

447
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,070
不
No!

448
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,620
不  我刚经历了一个超然的瞬间
No, I-I-I had a transcendent moment

449
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,930
找到了情感上的释然
where I found emotional clarity!

450
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,230
我知道大声嚷嚷
And I realize shouting that

451
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,460
听起来不像是真话  但确实如此
makes it seem like it's not true, but I did!

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,360
好吧  我们要去买点零食
Yeah, we're gonna grab some snacks.

453
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,980
你们要点什么
You guys want anything?

454
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,840
辣牛肉干
Spicy beef jerky.

455
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,770
完全明白你意思
Got you loud and clear.

456
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,290
我的天啊  巴尼
Oh, my God! Barney!

457
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,600
你解了我的咒
You unjinxed me!

458
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,890
我自由了  如果硬币上的野牛
I'm free! If the bison on the nickel

459
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,920
听到你这么说它们
could hear you talk about them,

460
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,240
它们会自我加剧灭绝的脚步
they would diminish their population even further on purpose.

461
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,000
如果莉莉想嘴里塞根"大香肠"  
If Lily wants a big wiener in her mouth,

462
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,470
她可以找我
she's got my number.

463
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,370
抱歉  这一路上车上有人放屁的罪
And I'm sorry that you took the rap for all the farting on

464
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,570
都让你顶了  其实是我放的
the car ride up here. That was me!

465
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,690
戒指  这是什么戒指
The ring! What's, what's, what's the ring?

466
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,680
对了  戒指  我打算向帕特里斯求婚
Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask Patrice to marry me.

467
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,870
你说真的吗
Are you serious?

468
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,710
"厄运结"  很好
Jinx! Good!

469
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,280
我得保证我说这些话时  你不插嘴
I need to say some things without you interrupting.

470
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,710
对  我是认真的  
Yes, I am serious.

471
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,280
我知道如果你现在能说话
I know that if you could talk,

472
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,490
你会说我疯了
you'd say that I'm crazy

473
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,750
或说我矫枉过正  说我进展太快了
or that I'm overcorrecting or that I'm moving too fast.

474
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,920
但你错了
But you would be wrong.

475
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,200
整个三角洲地带所有的浪货
Look, I have banged my way through every bimbo

476
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,250
我都睡过了  但睡过之后
in the tristate area, and it left me

477
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,920
内心除了破碎  就没其他感觉了
feeling nothing but, but broken.

478
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,850
但现在  跟帕特里斯一起
But now, with Patrice,

479
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,640
我人生中第一次  感到安定和快乐
for the first time in my life, I feel settled and happy.

480
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,810
我想这么过一辈子
I want to feel this way forever.

481
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,850
所以明天晚上  
So tomorrow night on the roof

482
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,600
在环球新闻大楼的屋顶
of the World Wide News building--

483
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,140
那是帕特里斯最喜欢的地方
that's Patrice's favorite spot--

484
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,500
我要向她求婚
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

485
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,950
不许说话  你被下咒了
Ah, poot-tu-tat! You're jinxed.

486
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,660
如果你愿遵守以下两条规矩  我就给你解咒
I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules:

487
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,590
第一  你不能试图劝我放弃
one you can't try to talk me out of it,

488
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,600
第二  你不能告诉任何人  同意吗
two you can't tell anybody. Agreed?

489
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,130
这可是以"厄运结"起誓  如果你食言了
It's a jinx swear, so if you break it,

490
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,760
我就可以用威浮球球棒
I get to hit you in the nuts three times

491
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,630
威浮球  一种空心棒球

492
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,630
朝你的蛋蛋猛击三下
with a Wiffle ball bat.

493
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,430
谢谢你  泰德
Thank you... Ted.

494
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,150
好啊  各位
Hi, guys!

495
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,640
不  你中了"厄运结"的啊
No. But you're jinxed!

496
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,150
带着要给你们的惊喜哦
And I've got your surprise right here!

497
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,910
我引诱泰德叫了我的名字
I tricked Ted into saying my name.

498
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,790
不是吧  泰德
Aw, come on, Ted!

499
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,390
"厄运结"  "厄运结"
Jinx! Jinx!

500
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,880
恐怖魔王的统治归来了
The reign of terror is back!

501
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,890
如果你们不想我在车里抽烟
Hey, if you guys don't want me to smoke

502
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,250
或放屁  但说无妨
or fart in here, just speak up.

503
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,520
没意见吗  很好
Nothing? Great.

504
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,420
谢谢你们给我买辣牛肉干啦
Thanks for the spicy beef jerky, dude.

505
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,250
不管怎样  现在安静会挺好的
Anyway, I think we could all use a little quiet.

506
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,010
除非你有什么想说的吗  泰德
Unless you have something you want to talk about, Ted?

507
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,400
没有
No.

508
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,860
想都别想  伙计
Not happening, bro.

509
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,170
<i>于是我答应巴尼  不告诉任何人</i>
<i>So I had promised not to tell anyone </i>

510
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,810
<i>他要向帕特里斯求婚的事</i>
<i>about Barney's plan to propose to Patrice.</i>

511
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,540
<i>但我心里明白  罗宾有权知道此事</i>
<i>But I knew deep down Robin deserved to know.</i>

512
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,120
看啊  他在这儿呢  
Uh, there he is!

513
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,970
纽约城历史上
The youngest architect ever

514
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,210
建造摩天大楼最年轻的建筑师
to build a skyscraper in New York City!

515
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,420
到现在居然还是单身的泰德・莫斯比
The shockingly still single Ted Mosby.

516
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,460
听见了吗  女士们
You hear that, ladies?

517
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,930
真不敢相信巨人银行大楼今晚就投入使用了
I can't believe the GNB Tower opens tonight.

518
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,900
泰德  世界终于要看到你的创世巨作了
Ted, your building finally gets unveiled to the whole world.

519
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,350
听见了吗  女士们
You hear that, ladies?!

520
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:48,480
紧张吗
Nervous?

521
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,150
我现在不只流汗流尿  屎也用流的了
Everything comes out of my body in liquid form now.

522
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,930
别听这句  女士们
Ignore that, ladies.

523
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,740
另外  我一直在做一个噩梦
Plus, I, I keep having this nightmare

524
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,550
梦见金刚在剪彩典礼上出现
where King Kong shows up to the opening

525
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,240
却不愿意爬上我的大楼
but refuses to climb my building

526
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,270
他说  "这楼修得太不怎么样了"
because, in his words, "It's a bit derivative."

527
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,080
别瞎想了  今晚会精彩绝伦的
Oh, stop it, tonight is gonna be amazing.

528
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,420
我们到时会给你敬酒致辞
And we are definitely gonna be there to toast you,

529
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,620
但如果可以  我们可能会提早离开
but we might have to leave a little early if that's okay.

530
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,970
我爸爸给了我们史无前例的超赞圣诞礼
My dad just gave us the most amazing Christmas gift ever.

531
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,740
马文出生后  我们第一次可以夜不归宿
Our first night away since Marvin was born.

532
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,430
24小时不用看见那小混蛋了
24 hours straight without that little bastard.

533
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,130
这故事真不错  回头等马文长大了
This will be a nice memory to share with Marvin

534
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,720
犹豫要不要送你们去老人院时
when he's older and deciding whether or not

535
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,210
我就讲给他听
to put you in a home.

536
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,820
我们很需要放个假了
Hey, we need this.

537
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,970
为了尽可能地节约时间
We're maximizing our time away

538
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,470
我们把每项安排的时间都精确到分钟了
by planning everything down to the minute.

539
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,520
看见没
See?

540
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,510
中午12点  劝说泰德
12 P..-- guilt Ted

541
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,800
同意让我们今晚可以早退
into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.

542
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,970
你们今晚可以早退啦
It's okay if you leave early tonight.

543
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,100
你们在我的大日子能过来一趟
Look, I just appreciate you showing up at all

544
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,340
我已经很感激了
on your big night away.

545
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,050
巴尼就根本不会来
I mean, Barney's not even gonna be there.

546
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,500
怎么会
What?

547
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,540
今晚是你职业生涯上最重要的一晚
This is the biggest night of your career.

548
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,760
巴尼为什么不来啊
Why isn't Barney coming?

549
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,020
我不清楚  他只说
I don't know-- he said,

550
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,290
"传奇"  "接受挑战"  然后眨了个眼
"legendary" and "challenge accepted," and then he winked.

551
00:22:57,290 --> 00:22:59,030
"等等"之类的
"wait for it,"  you know, all that stuff.

552
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,850
听起来是挺像他的
That does sound like him.

553
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,990
我们是你的真朋友
Well, we're your real friends

554
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,840
说什么也不会错过今晚的
and we wouldn't miss it for the world.

555
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,680
所以今晚我们会在7点03到那里
That is why we will see you tonight

556
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,100
然后7点14分走人
from 7:03 to 7:14.

557
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,380
-回见啦  -拜
- Bye, guys. - Bye.

558
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,770
巴尼究竟为什么不来
Okay, what's the real reason Barney's not coming?

559
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,290
<i>我本可以趁此机会告诉罗宾巴尼的事</i>
<i>Here was my chance to tell Robin about Barney.</i>

560
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,010
其实巴尼没说他今晚有什么安排
Yeah, actually, Barney didn't say what he was doing tonight.

561
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,370
但我今天晚上没有女伴
Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not taking anyone to the opening,

562
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,990
你愿意当我女伴吗
so you want to be my date?

563
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,560
当然
Sure.

564
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,880
爸爸  我给你写了一张单子
Okay, Dad, I-I made you a list

565
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,140
是马文晚上的注意事项  精确到分钟了哦
of Marvin's nightly schedule down to the minute.

566
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,640
好的
Okay.

567
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,450
下午六点  换上可食用内衣
Night, 06 P.M.-- put on edible underwear."

568
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,040
拿错单子了  弄错了
Wrong list, wrong list.

569
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,800
别紧张嘛
Come on, relax.

570
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,350
我对这小家伙了如指掌
I know this little guy like the back of my hand.

571
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,130
上帝啊  我掌后这是啥玩意
Dear Lord, what is that?

572
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,010
原来是果酱
Oh, jam, okay.

573
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,170
果酱而已
Just jam.

574
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,650
我忘记教你摇篮曲了
Oh, I-I forgot the lullaby.

575
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,870
你知道马文的专属摇篮曲吗
Do you know Marvin's lullaby?

576
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,550
我们每天晚上都唱给他听
We sing it to him every night.

577
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:07,230
晚安  晚安  小马文 *
* Night, night, little Marvin

578
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,230
天上星星为你闪 *
* Stars twinkle for you

579
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:15,810
梦界火车嘎嚓飞 *
* The Dreamland train's a-chuggin'

580
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,910
你的梦想皆实现 *

581
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,960
小马说晚安 *
* And the horsie says, "Good night"

582
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,100
鸟儿说晚安 *
* And the birdie says, "Good night"

583
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,970
大象说晚安 *

584
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,240
骷髅弹肋骨说晚安 *

585
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:41,890
机器人说晚安 *

586
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,360
晚安 *
* Good night.

587
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,580
吵死了  别唱了
Enough with the damn music!

588
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,650
纳斯比先生说晚安 *
* And Mr. Nesbit says, "Good night"

589
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,600
全世界都说晚安 *

590
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,180
该你了  妈咪
Take it, Mommy.

591
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,710
明白  给他喂点止咳糖浆
Got it-- load him up with cough syrup,

592
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,180
等他昏睡过去后看《绝命毒师》
watch Breaking Bad until he conks out.

593
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,860
开玩笑的啦
Just kidding.

594
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,820
我们成功了
We did it.

595
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,130
没错
Yeah, we did.

596
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,570
我们出家门了
Now that we're out the door,

597
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,950
而且我一点也不焦虑
I actually don't feel anxious.

598
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,490
天啊  是你爸
Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!

599
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,110
肯定有惨事发生了
Oh, something horrible happened-- aah!

600
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,460
是泰德  别紧张
Oh, it's Ted, relax.

601
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,510
酒吧  现在
Bar, now.

602
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,220
怎么了
What is it?

603
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,130
他要我过去
He needs me.

604
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,210
宝贝  那我们神奇浪漫的夜晚怎么办呀
But, baby, what about our magical romantic night?

605
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,930
我们本该在四分钟后
In four minutes we're supposed to

606
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,510
在出租车里开始"毛手毛脚"呢
be doing hand stuff in the cab.

607
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,740
我会尽快的  肯定没什么大事
I'll be quick-- I'm sure it's nothing huge.

608
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,930
这可是大事
That's huge.

609
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,930
是啊  所以今晚巴尼来不了了
Yeah, that's why Barney's not coming tonight.

610
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,290
他要求婚
He's getting engaged.

611
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,050
而且我知道我得告诉罗宾
And I knew that I had to tell Robin.

612
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:43,010
但是呢
But?

613
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,050
我好像...
I may have, uh...

614
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,360
邀请她当我今晚的女伴了
asked her to be my date instead.

615
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,080
我脑子到底哪里有病啊
What is wrong with me?

616
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,970
我心深处
Deep down,

617
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,610
是不是有个疯狂的我
is there still some crazy part of me

618
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:53,420
认为我和罗宾还有希望
that thinks I'm gonna wind up with Robin?

619
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,140
我就那么逃避现实吗
Am I that deluded?

620
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,020
如果真是如此  我得成熟起来
If so, I need to grow up.

621
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,850
对了  我现在算违背了"厄运结"誓言
Oh, um, by the way, I'm breaking a jinx swear here,

622
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,790
可别告诉巴尼  不然他可以
so don't tell Barney or he gets to whack me

623
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,580
用威浮球球棒狠打我的蛋蛋三次呢
in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat.

624
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,130
行  这些都不为过
Sure, pretty standard.

625
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,890
罗宾值得拥有去追回巴尼的最后一次机会
Robin deserves the chance to go after Barney one last time

626
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,740
只要她也心之所愿
if that's what she wants.

627
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,020
谢谢  哥们
Thanks, buddy.

628
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,830
说出来舒服多了
This helped.

629
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,060
那我去告诉她啦
I'm gonna go tell her.

630
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,880
等等  有件事
One quick thing.

631
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,320
别去
Don't.

632
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,920
真棒啊
Wow. Nice.

633
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,480
现在到了这儿  我就没觉得那么焦虑了
You know, now that I'm here, I don't feel that anxious.

634
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,110
是我爸  肯定发生了什么惨事
It's my dad-- something horrible's happened!

635
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,370
是我丈夫  放轻松
My husband, relax.

636
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,930
宝贝  我还得一会才能回去
Hey, um, I'm gonna be a little while, baby.

637
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:38,080
说来话长  但泰德需要我的帮助
It's a long story, but Ted needs my help.

638
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,430
好吧  但是快点
Okay, but hurry

639
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,850
不然我就自己做第十一条了
or I'm gonna start doing Number 11 on my own.

640
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,770
你能自己做"那个"啊
You can do that by yourself?

641
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,530
姐练过瑜伽  小贱人
Pilates, bitch.

642
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,480
好吧  那为什么我不该告诉罗宾
Okay, why shouldn't I tell Robin?

643
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,000
因为你内心深处有个疯狂的你
Because deep down some crazy part of you

644
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,680
仍然认为你和罗宾有希望  我同意这点
still thinks you're gonna wind up with her, and I agree.

645
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,530
-马修  -很抱歉  我就是支持泰德的
- Marshall... - I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward.

646
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,660
以前是  现在是  永远都是
Always have been, always will be.

647
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,490
听着
Now, listen.

648
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,180
我想要我最好的朋友能幸福
I want my best friend to be happy.

649
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,740
如果罗宾就是你的幸福
And if Robin could mean happiness for you,

650
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,490
那老天  你为什么要帮她去追另一个男人啊
then, dear God, why help her go after another man?

651
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,860
因为她可能还爱着他
Because she might still be in love with him.

652
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,280
如果我不告诉她  不给她机会
To not tell her, to not give her that chance,

653
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,590
就太自私了
it's... it's selfish.

654
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,650
那就自私一回吧
So be selfish.

655
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:17,860
我做不到
I can't do that.

656
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,900
跟我分吃洋葱圈时  你怎么就不这么"无私"
Tell that to the onion rings we just "split."

657
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,960
罗宾是我的朋友
Robin is my friend.

658
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,120
她一直不只是朋友  你心里清楚
She's always been more than that and you know it.

659
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,160
现在  就在我们讲话之际
Now, as we speak,

660
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,980
我妻子正在酒店房间对我不忠
my wife is in a hotel room cheating on me...

661
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,050
跟自己出轨
with herself.

662
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,260
但我死也不会走
But I'm not leaving here

663
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,390
除非你答应我
until you promise not to say

664
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,220
你绝不会跟罗宾透露半句
a word about this to Robin.

665
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,500
跟着我念  "我..."
Now repeat after me. "I..."

666
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,740
可以一次多几个词  我应付得来
Well, I can do more at a time than "I."

667
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,920
"我  泰德・莫斯比  发誓
"I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop

668
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,290
不再把别人的利益置于身前
putting everyone else's interests ahead of my own,

669
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,150
在一生中就那么一次  为自己着想"
and for once in my life, do what's best for me."

670
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,110
我...
I...

671
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,990
抱歉  其他是什么来着
Sorry, what was the rest of that?

672
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,660
爸爸  我从我们的美妙之夜里
Hey, Dad, just taking a break

673
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,810
偷个空来问个好
from our amazing night to check in.

674
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,970
我不在马文一定情绪很低落吧
I bet Marvin's pretty devastated that I'm not there, huh?

675
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,660
完全没有  我觉得他都没意识到你不在
Not at all-- I don't think he even noticed you're gone.

676
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,780
感觉是"妈咪  那谁啊"的感觉
It's kind of like Mommy who?

677
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,140
那很好
Oh... oh, good.

678
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,140
但是以防万一  我还是给他在电话里
But I should probably sing him his nighttime lullaby

679
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,800
唱睡前摇篮曲吧
over the phone, just in case.

680
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,120
给他唱过了  唱得超棒呢
Sang it already-- nailed it.

681
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,250
你学小马了吗
Did you do the horsie?

682
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,420
-学了  -小鸟呢
- Yep. - The birdie?

683
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,730
-学了  -大象呢
- Yep. - Elephant?

684
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,980
-学了  -麋鹿呢
- Yep. - Moose.

685
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,040
没有麋鹿  少唬我
No moose, trick question.

686
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,020
机器人呢
Robot.

687
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,220
我要挂了
Look, I should go.

688
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,600
马文在我怀里睡觉呢
Marvin's asleep in my arms.

689
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,380
他的头闻起来都是爱的味道
Mmm, his head smells like love.

690
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,720
再见
Bye.

691
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,120
<i>所以孩子们  在这个寒冷的十二月夜里</i>
<i>And so, kids, on that cold December night</i>

692
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,890
<i>我决定接受你们马修叔叔的建议</i>
<i>I decided to take your Uncle Marshall's advice</i>

693
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,070
<i>自私一点</i>
<i>and be a little selfish.</i>

694
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,230
你好  真是美呆啦
Hello... and hubba-hubba.

695
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,360
谢谢
Aw, thanks.

696
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,010
但今晚的超级男主角可是莫斯比哦
But tonight is about my main man Mosby.

697
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,320
是吗  为什么啊
Really? Why?

698
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,280
泰德  告诉兰吉特
Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit

699
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,450
今晚要发生的那件大事啊
the huge thing that's happening tonight.

700
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,420
巴尼要订婚了
Barney's getting engaged.

701
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:07,120
兰吉特退场
Ranjit out.

702
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,270
巴  巴尼要订婚了吗
Bar-Barney's getting engaged?

703
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,130
他让我保密
He asked me to keep it a secret,

704
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,810
但我觉得你应该知道
but I thought you deserved to know...

705
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,680
以免你想做些什么
in case you wanted to do something about it.

706
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,560
你想吗
Do you?

707
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,880
你想吗  罗宾
Do you, Robin?

708
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,750
兰吉特  给点私人空间好吗
Ranjit, a little privacy, please?

709
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,600
抱歉  我没在听哦
Sorry, not listening.

710
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:44,210
好啊  泰德  这地高低不平
Nice, uneven floor there, Ted.

711
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,100
莉莉  你喝醉了吗
Lily, are you drunk?

712
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,580
什么  我在度假
What? I... I'm on vacation.

713
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,520
我撬开小酒柜来喝两杯也不为过啊
I may have cracked open the minibar to celebrate.

714
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,780
这缉毒警谁找来的啊
Who invited the Narc?

715
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,840
听着  我知道你想马文
Hey, listen, I know that you miss Marvin,

716
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,250
但是这种正装宴会上我们也没办法
but it's not like we could've brought him

717
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,710
带他一起来啊
to a black tie event anyway.

718
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,090
没有童装版燕尾服可以给他穿啊
I don't think that they make tuxedo onesies.

719
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,740
我是说  没有帅气的童装燕尾服嘛
I mean, at least not ones that are in style.

720
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,790
还打蝴蝶领结
I mean, a bow tie?

721
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,040
现在难道还是98年吗
Is it 1998 already?

722
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,470
那些父母弱爆了  真粘娃
Yeah, these parents are so lame and-and clingy.

723
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,990
该学会放手了吧  你们俩废柴
Yeah, it's like, cut the cord already, right, guys?

724
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,130
对啊  那宝宝也一点都不可爱
Yeah, yeah, that baby's not even cute.

725
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:18,780
超级丑娃
Super ugly baby.

726
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,120
看样子就想吐
It's almost physically repulsive.

727
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,080
这下好了  我都开始分泌乳汁了
Great, I just started lactating.

728
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,740
我也是
Me, too.

729
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,690
那你打算怎么办
So, what do you want to do?

730
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,950
罗宾  我不想多管闲事
Robin, I do not want to meddle,

731
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,710
但是有首经典恋歌就是这样...
but this is like the classic love song says...

732
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,100
兰吉特
Ranjit.

733
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,300
兰吉特  从现在开始我们还是用短信交流吧
Ranjit, let's just communicate via text from now on, okay?

734
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:58,010
感谢你做的一切
I appreciate what you're doing.

735
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,170
但我再也不想去争取巴尼了
But I'm not chasing after Barney anymore.

736
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,110
我已厌倦如此为爱癫狂了
I-I just got done being crazy about all that.

737
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,100
我为何要再跳回那万劫不复的深渊呢
I mean, why would I want to throw myself back in that pit?

738
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,650
因为你还爱着他
Because you're in love with him.

739
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,470
不  我不爱了
No, I'm not.

740
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,340
我替他感到高兴
I'm happy for him.

741
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:16,510
所以巴尼・斯丁森将要在环球新闻大楼顶
So, it doesn't bother you that Barney Stinson's gonna propose

742
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:19,800
对另一个女人求婚  你都不介意吗
to another woman on top of the World Wide News building?

743
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,810
等等  为什么要在我公司大楼顶求婚啊
Wait, why the top of the World Wide News building?

744
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,300
我猜那是帕特里斯最爱的地方吧
I guess it's Patrice's favorite spot in the city.

745
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,390
我靠  帕特里斯  那是我最爱的地方
Damn it, Patrice, that's my favorite spot in the city!

746
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,910
激动啊...
Whoa.

747
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,800
兰吉特也说"激动啊"
Ranjit says, "Whoa."

748
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,190
好啦
Okay...

749
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:39,790
这小细节可能让我有点不爽
maybe that one detail stings a little bit,

750
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,370
但并不表示我还爱着巴尼啊
but that doesn't mean I'm in love with Barney.

751
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,990
"她一听就还爱着巴尼"
"Sounds like she's in love with Barney."

752
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,130
这分隔板有任何一点隔音效果吗
Okay, is this divider even slightly soundproof?

753
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,880
"当然有"
"Yes."

754
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,160
还发了个眨眼的符号
With a little winky face.

755
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,250
我诚心祝福巴尼幸福
Look, I... I hope it goes well for Barney.

756
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,840
我真心祝福他
I really do.

757
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,170
但今晚除了你的大楼
But tonight there is no place I would rather be

758
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,700
我哪都不会去
than at your building.

759
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,660
陪你庆祝
Celebrating with you.

760
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:04,870
你确定吗
Are you sure?

761
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,580
兰吉特  去西区泰德的超酷大楼
Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's kick-ass building.

762
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,380
我听不见你说啥哦
I cannot hear you.

763
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,090
我们五分钟后到
We will be there in five minutes.

764
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:18,870
拥有这孩子完全不代表你们很特别
This kid does not mean that you're special.

765
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:22,120
只代表了你很下流  你很淫荡
It just means that you're horny and you're easy.

766
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,250
废话少说  让老娘闻闻她头
Now, come on, let me smell his head.

767
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,470
莉莉  莉莉  别  别  别这样
Li-Lily, Lily, no, no, no, no, come on.

768
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,520
泰德  说真的  你这破地板是怎样啊
Seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?

769
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,780
-莉莉  -干嘛
- Lily. - What?

770
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,870
离开马文的身边
Is it harder than we thought

771
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,750
比我们想象中难熬吗  的确
to be away from Marvin? Yes.

772
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,170
但我们今晚是要好好享乐  还是要蹲角落
But are we gonna have fun or are we gonna wallow

773
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,630
像白痴一样痛哭流涕呢
in the corner like idiots?

774
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,690
晚安  晚安  小马文 *
* Night, night, little Marvin

775
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,000
天上星星为你闪 *
* Stars twinkle for you

776
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:52,100
梦界火车嘎嚓飞 *
* The Dreamland train's a-chuggin'

777
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,030
你的梦想皆实现 *
* All your dreams will come true.

778
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,080
你意识到你脑海中构筑的东西
Do you realize that something you thought up in your head

779
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,320
现在真成为曼哈顿天际的一部分了吗
now exists as a part of the Manhattan skyline?

780
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,130
这很了不起呢
That's huge.

781
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,230
只是栋楼罢了
It's just a building.

782
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,570
我这么年轻就有如此成就  实属不易
I mean, I'm incredibly young for such an achievement,

783
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,790
但也只是栋楼罢了
but it's just a building.

784
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:19,170
虽然《建筑视野周报》
I mean, Architecture Vision Weekly

785
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,030
说我那楼"不仅仅是一栋楼"
may have dubbed it "more than just a building,"

786
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,260
但也就只是栋楼罢了
but it's just a building.

787
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,730
但也不用小题大...
So let's not get carried...

788
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,240
好啦  你说得对  的确很了不起
Okay, you're right, it's huge.

789
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,570
是很了得啊
It is huge.

790
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,390
你可是今晚派对的主角  更何况
You're the star of the party, and who knows?

791
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,740
说不定你未来的夫人也会在场呢
Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby is gonna be there.

792
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:38,040
的确  说不定呢
Yeah, maybe she will.

793
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,020
等等  这不是你的楼
Wait, this isn't your...

794
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,550
这是环球新闻大楼
This is the World Wide News building.

795
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,150
把他追回来
Go get him.

796
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,790
都说我不想再去争取巴尼了
I told you, I am done chasing Barney.

797
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,040
我们可以去你派对了吗
Now can we please go to your party?

798
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,750
罗宾  你是想浪费一晚的时间
Robin, do you want to spend tonight

799
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:04,120
在我那前卫又不失高雅的神作大楼里
making small talk with a bunch of bankers

800
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,870
与一帮银行家们闲聊瞎扯呢
in a daring yet refined contemporary masterpiece

801
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,750
金刚也该为自己能爬那楼而感到荣幸
King Kong should feel lucky to climb...

802
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,140
还是你想跟随心之所愿
...or do you want to follow your heart?

803
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,090
你为何一直说我对巴尼还有感觉啊
Why do you keep insisting that I have feelings for Barney?

804
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,980
因为你确实还有
Because you do.

805
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,130
你看  兰吉特也这么认为
See, even Ranjit agrees.

806
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,030
原来他是要去尿尿
Oh, he's got to pee.

807
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,010
重点是
The point is,

808
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,100
你还忘不了巴尼
you're not over Barney.

809
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,060
所以你听到他要在环球新闻大楼顶
That's why you freaked out about him proposing

810
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,590
跟人求婚时  你反应超激动
on the roof of the World Wide News building.

811
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:31,280
我才没反应过激
I did not freak out.

812
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,550
只是有点...
It's just...

813
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,550
有点小小闹心
a teeny, tiny bit annoying

814
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,340
因为那地方
that I am the one

815
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,580
还是老娘带她认识的呢
who showed her that roof in the first place!

816
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,180
去你的  帕特里斯
Damn it, Patrice!

817
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,790
你...
Whoa.

818
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,310
"没事了  我找到个汽水瓶"
"Never mind; I found a soda bottle."

819
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:48,360
这也太恶心了
Okay, that's disturbing.

820
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,220
你想我怎么样啊  泰德
What do you want me to do, Ted?

821
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,340
冲上大楼顶
Run up to that roof,

822
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,190
把巴尼手上的求婚戒打飞
knock the ring out of Barney's hand,

823
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,060
然后说  "抱歉打扰了  但你该跟我在一起"
and say, "sorry to interrupt, but you should be with me"?

824
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,410
这不就是你想要的吗
Is that what you want?

825
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,860
不是
No.

826
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,430
我不想要
I don't.

827
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,660
我不想老让自己当傻瓜
I can't keep making an ass of myself.

828
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,990
这个嘛
Well,

829
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,060
我要替"让自己当傻瓜"说句话
a word in defense of making an ass of yourself,

830
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,210
当傻瓜其实挺好的
it's underrated.

831
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,350
八年前
Eight years ago

832
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,620
我像个傻瓜一般地追你
I made an ass of myself chasing after you,

833
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,430
在那之后  我还继续多次让自己
and I've made an ass of myself chasing after you

834
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,570
像个傻瓜一样地追你
a bunch of times since then.

835
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,110
但我从没后悔过
But I have no regrets.

836
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,620
因为我得到了一件我千金也不换的东西
Because it led me to something that I wouldn't trade for the world.

837
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,790
那就是我们的友情
It led to you being my friend.

838
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,490
作为你的朋友
So, as your friend

839
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,710
以及"让自己当傻瓜"界的领衔人物
and a leading expert in the field of making an ass of yourself,

840
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,480
我打从心底
I say to you

841
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,100
想对你说
from the heart,

842
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,940
滚下这辆车
get the hell out of this car.

843
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,330
可是  泰德
But, Ted,

844
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,960
今晚是你的大日子
your big night.

845
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,990
只是栋楼罢了
It's just a building.

846
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,030
《罗宾》
The Robin.

847
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,100
《罗宾》

848
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,460
第一步
Step one:

849
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,230
向她承认  自己还对她有感觉
admit to yourself that you still have feelings for this girl.

850
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,530
我无可救药地  义无反顾地爱着她
I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her.

851
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,820
而她却不知道我的爱有这么深
More than she knows.

852
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,190
第二步
Step two:

853
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,090
在最不适当的时刻  如刚从脱衣俱乐部出来
choose the completely wrong moment to make a drunken move

854
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
借着酒劲对她做出行动
after hanging out at a strip club

855
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,990
然后故意被她拒绝
and get shot down on purpose.

856
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,180
第三步
Step three:

857
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,910
同意你俩不合适

858
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:18,570
关上你们未来任何可能的大门
locking the door on any future you could have together.

859
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,750
我彻底放弃争取你了
I'm done trying to get you.

860
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,570
我无法再继续了
I can't do it anymore.

861
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,480
这会让罗宾疯掉
Which will drive Robin nuts.

862
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,740
第四步
Step four:

863
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,700

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,230
找出全世界最能激怒罗宾的人

866
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,770
没人叫你帮忙  帕特里斯
Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!

867
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,410
然后找她帮忙
...and ask for her help.

868
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,620
你好  巴尼
Oh, hi, Barney.

869
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,970
你在这里干嘛
What are you doing here?

870
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,290
其实我是来找你的
Actually, I'm looking for you.

871
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,300
这事可能很怪  但我想请你帮我...
This may sound kind of weird, but I have a proposition...

872
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,070
向帕特里斯解释一切
Explain everything to Patrice

873
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,760
并希望她同意帮忙
and hope she agrees to help.

874
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,750

878
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,670

第七步
Step seven:

880
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,040
假装跟帕特里斯约会
pretend to be dating Patrice.

881
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
没人请你来  帕特里斯
Nobody asked you here, Patrice!

882
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,000
是我请的
Actually, I did.

883

第八步
Step eight:

884
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:16,120
等着罗宾不出所料地闯入你家里
wait until Robin inevitably breaks into your place

885
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,550
找出《泡妞秘笈》  并拿给帕特里斯看
to find the Playbook and show it to Patrice,

886
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,420
而你可以从公寓里的隐藏摄像头
which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras

887
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,470
监视到这一切
you have in your apartment.

888
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,860
帕特里斯  罗宾入网了
Patrice, the robin's in the nest.

889
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,310
就是罗宾闯进我公寓的意思
That means Robin broke into my apartment

890
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,400
我解释暗号的时候  你有没有听啊
Were you even listening when I explained the codes?

891
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,310
第九步
Step nine:

892
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,480
在帕特里斯发现真有《泡妞秘籍》后
after Patrice finds the Playbook,

893
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,760
你们第一次大吵了一架
have your first big fight.

894
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,010
事情进展得太顺利了
This is going so well.

895
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,900
感激不尽啊
Thank you so much.

896
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,540
对啊  但为什么莉莉和泰德会在这里啊
I know, but what the heck are Lily and Ted doing here?

897
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,170
不知道  我朋友做人从没有界限
I don't know. My friends have no boundaries.

898
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,730
我该怎么感谢你啊
How can I ever thank you?

899
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:50,710
下周末能帮我照看下我的猫吗
Will you watch my cat next weekend?

900
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,270
不行
No.

901
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,980
走吧  我们该进去了
Come on, we should probably go back inside.

902
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,210
第十步
Step ten:

903
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,600
为了向帕特里斯表忠诚
prove your loyalty to Patrice

00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,600
烧掉《泡妞秘籍》
by burning the Playbook,

905
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,330
然后就真的烧掉了
and actually burn it.

906
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,270
因为你再也不需要了
You don't need it anymore.

907
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:08,370
第十一步
Step 11:

908
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,540
因为你的朋友做人没有界限
because your friends have no boundaries,

909
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,980
他们肯定会给罗宾开个劝诫大会
they'll inevitably have an intervention for Robin,

910
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,980
而你可以通过藏在莉莉和马修公寓的
which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras

911
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:17,490
隐藏摄像头监视到这一切

913
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,390
只告诉泰德一个人  你打算跟帕特里斯求婚

914
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,880
你不能告诉任何人
You can't tell anybody.

915
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,380
同意吗
Agreed?

916
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,280
第十三步
Step 13:

917
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,410
坐等泰德是否会告诉罗宾
wait and see if Ted tells Robin,

918
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,560
如果他真说了...
and if he does...

919
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,170
巴尼要订婚了
Barney's getting engaged.

920
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,240
就意味着你全世界最好的兄弟
...it means your best bro in the world

921
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,950
已经彻底放下罗宾  并给予你他的祝福

00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:43,130
罗宾来到这城市她最爱的地方
Robin arrives at her favorite spot in the city

924
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,270
并发现《泡妞秘籍》隐藏的最后一页
and finds the secret final page of the Playbook.

925
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,440
你泡妞生涯最后一次出招
The last play you'll ever run.

926
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,100
《罗宾》

927

第十五步
Step 15:

928
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:55,810
罗宾意识到自己站在槲寄生下面
Robin realizes she's standing underneath mistletoe.

929
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:58,270
在西方圣诞风俗中  站在槲寄生下的人不能拒绝亲吻
而在槲寄生下接吻的情侣将会幸福终生

930
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,220
你不是吧  巴尼
Seriously, Barney?

931
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,080
即使你是
Even you,

932
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,690
即使是像你这样不折不扣的疯子
even someone as certifiably insane as you

933
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,330
也该意识到  这么做太过分了吧
must realize that this is too far.

934
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,460
你欺骗我
You lied to me,

935
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,560
暗地里算计了我几周
manipulated me for weeks.

936
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:22,500
你觉得我知情后  我还会亲你吗
Do you really think I could ever kiss you after that?

937
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,250
你觉得我知情后  还会信任你吗
Do you really think I could ever trust you after that?

938
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,230
这个  就是我们俩不合适的证据
This... this is proof of why we don't work,

939
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,290
我们俩不可能在一起的原因
why we'll never work.

940
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,200
谢谢你
So thank you.

941
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,260
你让我自由了  因为...
You've set me free because...

942
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,460
我怎么可能会跟自以为用
how could I be with a man who thinks that this...

943
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:41,040
这种烂把戏  这种弥天大谎
trick, this enormous lie

944
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,430
就能让我想再次跟他约会的人一起
could ever make me want to date him again?

945
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,830
把那页翻过来
Turn it over.

946
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,960
第十六步  希望她会说"愿意"

947
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,570
罗宾・特布罗斯基
Robin Scherbatsky...

948
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,670
你愿意嫁给我吗

我所有绝望的呼喊 *
* All my desperate calls

956
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,560
在墙间回荡*
* Echo off the walls

957
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,020
久久不息 *
* Back and forth...

958
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:35,810
让我们举杯向泰德・莫斯比致敬
And so, let's all raise a glass to Ted Mosby.

959
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,900
我们有幸站在这里  全是他的功劳
None of this would have been possible without him.

960
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,700
敬泰德
To Ted.

961
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,250
敬泰德
To Ted.

00:41:52,070 --> 00:42:01,900
相信自己踽踽独行 *
* To believe I walk alone

963
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:16,180
这是别人告诉我的谎言 *
* It's a lie that I've been told

964
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,910
不要灰心丧气 *
