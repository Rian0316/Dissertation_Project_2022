1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,384
我想出了一个科学笑话 你想听吗?
I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?

2
00:00:06,385 --> 00:00:07,564
当然
Sure.

3
00:00:07,565 --> 00:00:11,166
扭进一个灯泡需要多少个爱迪生?
How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

4
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:12,835
多少个?
How many?

5
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:14,837
无所谓 灯泡的主意是他剽窃的
Who cares? He stole the idea

6
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,172
所以他没资格有自己的笑话
and doesn't deserve his own joke.

7
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:18,741
真的是剽窃的吗?
Is that really true?

8
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:21,410
当然 这才算是好笑话
Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke.

9
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:24,046
不仅有娱乐性 还能教人知识
It not only entertains, it informs.

10
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,082
嘿 抱歉打扰了
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

11
00:00:27,084 --> 00:00:28,417
呃 Barry
Uh, Barry,

12
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,620
扭进一个灯泡需要多少个爱迪生?
uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

13
00:00:31,622 --> 00:00:34,022
你知道其实爱迪生没有发明灯泡吧?
Did you know Edison didn't actually invent the light bulb?

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,595
你来干嘛 Barry?
What do you want, Barry?

15
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:42,598
只是想把这份小谢礼送给Amy
Just wanted to drop this off as a little thank you for Amy.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,932
谢我什么?
What's this for?

17
00:00:43,934 --> 00:00:45,734
你的主意真的帮了大忙
Your idea really helped me out.

18
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:48,370
我的光锥量子化论文已经上线了
My light-cone quantization paper's online already.

19
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:50,873
反响非常热烈
The response has been amazing.

20
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,307
真是太好了
Well, that's fascinating.

21
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:53,776
我等不及拜读了
I can't wait to read it.

22
00:00:53,778 --> 00:00:55,110
哦 我也是
Oh, no, me as well.

23
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:59,214
请发送到Sheldon@逗你玩 点 鄙之
Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

24
00:00:59,216 --> 00:01:00,549
为什么用"点 鄙之"?
Why "dot-biz"?

25
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:02,084
因为我刚鄙视你了
Because I just gave you the business.

26
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,254
{\an8}(.com其实是常用域名后缀 为和前面笑点统一 此处没有直译)

27
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:05,254
而且 逗你玩 点 康姆 被人注册掉了
And also Bazinga.com was taken.

28
00:01:06,923 --> 00:01:08,924
再次感谢你
Anyway, thanks again.

29
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:10,592
Cooper 滚蛋去
Cooper, suck eggs.

30
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,330
你什么时候开始帮Barry Kripke了?
Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?

31
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,833
我一直试图从细胞自动机的角度研究
Well, I'd been thinking about a cellular automata approach

32
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,334
神经元连通性
to neuronal connectivity,

33
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:21,170
我觉得它在弦理论领域可能会有一些
and I thought it might have some interesting applications

34
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,738
有趣的应用... 没什么大不了的
to string theory... it's not a big deal.

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,640
真的吗?
Oh, really?

36
00:01:24,642 --> 00:01:27,309
当我研究弦理论碰壁的时候
When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end,

37
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,077
你为什么没试着帮我?
why didn't you try to help me?

38
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,080
我想帮你的... 但你说生物学家唯一会做的算数
I did ... you said the only math biologists know is

39
00:01:32,082 --> 00:01:34,249
就是如果你有三只青蛙 一只跳走了
if you have three frogs and one hops away,

40
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,485
那就只剩两只青蛙了
that leaves two frogs.

41
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:39,755
真有趣 听着的确像我说的
That's pretty funny, that does sound like me.

42
00:01:39,757 --> 00:01:40,923
但这并不意味着
But that doesn't mean

43
00:01:40,925 --> 00:01:42,891
你就应该站在街角
that you should be standing on street corners

44
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:46,128
把你的数学理论送给路过的陌生人
handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.

45
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:49,164
Sheldon 我们都是科学家
Sheldon, we're all scientists.

46
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,833
我帮了一个同事
I helped out a fellow colleague.

47
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:52,167
你太小气了
You're being petty.

48
00:01:52,169 --> 00:01:53,769
我小气?
I'm being petty?

49
00:01:53,771 --> 00:01:57,105
你明知道我和Barry在研究上是竞争关系
You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry.

50
00:01:57,107 --> 00:01:59,208
你也听到他说的了... 他让我滚蛋
You heard him... he told me to suck eggs.

51
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,210
如果我们是朋友 他就会让我去
If we were friends, he would have suggested

52
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:02,611
滚点好东西
I suck something more pleasant.

53
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:07,482
你干嘛笑?
Why are you laughing?

54
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:08,984
你学到什么了吗?
Did you learn something?

55
00:02:10,854 --> 00:02:14,489
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

56
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,793

* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

57
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,461
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

58
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:22,164
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *

好的 妈妈
Okay, Ma.

67
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,623
替我跟Gladys姑姑问好
Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

68
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,891
好 我也爱你
Yeah, I love you, too.

69
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:44,893
再见
Bye.

70
00:02:44,894 --> 00:02:46,727
你妈妈在弗洛里达玩得开心吗?
Your mom having fun in Florida?

71
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:48,062
她很喜欢那里
Mmm, she loves it.

72
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:50,064
她终于找到个所有人都在说自己
She finally found a place where everyone talks about

73
00:02:50,066 --> 00:02:51,465
满身臭汗的地方了
how sweaty they are.

74
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,502
还有 她让我们去她家一次
Anyway, she wants us to go to the house

75
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:57,605
看看Stuart怎么样 因为他可能会"寂寞"
and check in on Stuart because he might be "lonely."

76
00:02:57,607 --> 00:02:59,273
她只是很友善而已
She's just being nice.

77
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:01,509
我是她儿子 她怎么就不派个人过来
Well, I'm her son, how come she doesn't send someone

78
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,177
看看我有没有寂寞呢?
to check on me if I'm lonely?

79
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:05,179
因为你有老婆
Because you have a wife.

80
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,318
没错 但你有时候会加班
Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.

81
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,288
我知道你不喜欢Stuart住在你妈家里
I know you don't like Stuart being in the house,

82
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,790
但漫画店马上就要重新开张了
but the store's about to reopen,

83
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,158
我想他会很快东山再起的
I'm sure he'll get back on his feet.

84
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,693
那就好了
That would be great.

85
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:21,095
我也希望我和我妈妈之间的关系能恢复正常
I'd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.

86
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,732
"正常"言过其实了 不过也行
Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.

87
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:31,338
- 你好  - 不好
- Hey.  - Hello.

88
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,873
你没事吧?
You okay?

89
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,209
如果我没事 我就会说"你好"了
If I was okay, I would've said "hello"

90
00:03:35,211 --> 00:03:36,944
而不是死气沉沉的"不好"
and not the much more ominous "hello."

91
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:39,647
出什么事了?
What's going on?

92
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:41,115
我在生Amy的气
I'm mad at Amy.

93
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:45,052
她也在你最喜欢的露脐装上留了油渍?
Did she leave pit stains in your favorite crop top, too?

94
00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:47,722
没有
No.

95
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:51,225
她帮Barry Kripke在弦理论领域实现了突破
She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.

96
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,360
听起来是件好事呀
Oh, that sounds like a good thing.

97
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:56,230
本来是好事 但我就是因为以为
Well, it would be, except that I left string theory

98
00:03:56,232 --> 00:03:58,165
弦理论没戏了才放弃的
because I decided it was a dead end.

99
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,334
没错 然后她就背着我
Yeah, and then she went behind my back

100
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:02,203
帮别人证明我是错的
to help someone else prove me wrong.

101
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:03,804
偏偏帮的还是我的对手
My rival, no less.

102
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:17,718
抱歉让你看到我这样子
I'm sorry you had to see that.

103
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,088
抱歉我竟然没带相机
I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

104
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,090
她为什么要这么对我?
Why would she do this to me?

105
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,760
我想她应该不是故意气你的
Well, I'm sure she didn't upset you on purpose.

106
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,261
而且 你不是经常说
Besides, aren't you the one who says

107
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,864
"没有比科学进步更重要了的"吗?
there's nothing more important than the advancement of science?

108
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,366
不 我说的是"没有比我让科学进步
No, I said there's nothing more important

109
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:34,702
更重要了的"
than me advancing science.

110
00:04:34,704 --> 00:04:36,670
好吧 如果我没理解错的话
All right, well, if I'm understanding this right,

111
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:39,006
她只不过是帮了另外一个科学家
and all she did was help out another scientist,

112
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,675
我想这件事你应该随它去吧
I'm thinking you might have to let this one go.

113
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:43,677
"随它吧"
Ugh, "let it go."

114
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:46,046
我听了一辈子这句话
I have heard that my whole life.

115
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:48,215
每次我郁闷的时候 就会有人跟我说 "别想它了"
Every time something upsets me somebody says, "let it go,"

116
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,717
就好像是我的错似的
you know, like it's my fault,

117
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:51,719
而且我难过也不行
and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.

118
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,120
我也不知道怎么劝你
I don't know what to tell you.

119
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:54,555
你和她谈谈啊
I mean, why don't you talk to her?

120
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:56,557
你就这点本事吗?
Is that all you have?

121
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,493
老生常谈的"和她谈谈"还有“别想它了”?
Shopworn tidbits like "talk to her" and "let it go"?

122
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,362
天啊 Penny 生活就这么欺骗了我
Gee, Penny, life's giving me lemons.

123
00:05:01,364 --> 00:05:02,696
我还能怎么办?
What should I do?

124
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:05,032
你可以把他推倒在一边
Well, you could shove them somewhere.

125
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:09,737
不错 这样就有趣多了
Okay, now you're getting creative.

126
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,773
太谢谢你们来帮忙了
Thanks again for your help.

127
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,108
- 没事  - 不用客气
- No problem.  - Our pleasure.

128
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,576
这里看起来真棒
The place really looks great.

129
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:18,045
是啊 你早几年就应该一把火烧了以前的店面
Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.

130
00:05:18,047 --> 00:05:21,415
我说过多少次了 我没放火
I keep telling you I didn't burn it down.

131
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,083
我们懂的 懂的... 因为放火烧房子
We know, we know ... because burning something down

132
00:05:23,085 --> 00:05:25,920
骗保险赔款是"违法"的
for the insurance money is a "crime."

133
00:05:27,088 --> 00:05:30,157
Stuart 这里好漂亮
Stuart, this place looks amazing.

134
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:31,125
谢了
Thanks.

135
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:33,394
你做的真不错
You really did a nice job.

136
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,729
谢谢你这段时间一直
And thank you for putting up with me

137
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:37,398
同意我住在你妈妈那里
staying at your mom's through all this.

138
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
如果不是这样 我肯定没法重新开业
I... I couldn't have done it otherwise.

139
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:42,403
不用客气 我也很开心看到...
I appreciate that, and I'm glad you were able to...

140
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:45,606
那是我妈妈的家具吗?
Is that my mother's furniture?

141
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,244
是啊 她说我可以搬过来用
Yeah, she said I could use it.

142
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:51,612
看起来多好!
Doesn't it look great?

143
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:54,748
我觉得不如以前在客厅里的样子好
Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.

144
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,450
淡定 Howie
Howie.

145
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,553
你怎么不干脆吧整个房子都洗劫一空?
Why don't you just clean out the whole room?

146
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,889
把我三年级给她做的绳编小丑
Take the string art clown I made her in third grade

147
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:03,490
和我游泳课上因为能把脸放进水里
and the ribbon I got in swim class

148
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,925
而赢得的缎带都拿走
for putting my face in the water.

149
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,260
你没事吧?
What is your problem?

150
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:07,595
她都说我可以搬走家具了
She said it was okay.

151
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:10,197
我是他的儿子 我觉得不可以
Well, I'm her son, and I say it's not okay.

152
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,567
儿子... 看起来你做那个小丑也就花了十分钟
Some son ... looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.

153
00:06:15,503 --> 00:06:17,972
是不是我也应该像你一样 去读个艺术学校
Well, maybe I should've gone to a fancy art school like you.

154
00:06:17,974 --> 00:06:19,607
这样我就可以开一间倒闭的漫画书店
Then I could run a failed comic shop

155
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:20,908
然后勾搭别人的妈妈了
and mooch off some guy's mother.

156
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:23,844
我们先走吧 你冷静一下
Why don't we leave so you can cool off?

157
00:06:23,846 --> 00:06:25,846
有道理
I think that's a good idea.

158
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:27,114
让他滚出我的店
Take him out of my store.

159
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:28,215
你的店?!
Your store?!

160
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,217
是我妈妈给你钱让你重新开业的
My mother gave you the money to reopen.

161
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,819
我还就不走了
I'm not going anywhere.

162
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,520
咱们去买点聚会要吃的东西吧
Why don't we go get the food for the party.

163
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:34,622
谢了
Thank you.

164
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,624
机智... 看起来咱们帮了大忙了
Smart ... looks like we're being helpful.

165
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,292
是啊 其实咱们是逃离了
Mmm, when really we're just exiting

166
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,960
一个尴尬的场合
an uncomfortable situation.

167
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:45,866
Kripke 你知道么 所有人里... Barry Kripke他
Kripke, you know, of all the people ... Barry Kripke.

168
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,035
我真是... 你这样像疯子一样叠衣服
I'm so... Are you folding it like a crazy person

169
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:49,703
是想让我帮你叠吗?!
to get me to do it for you?!

170
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,006
不是
No.

171
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,876
天啊 我来吧
Oh, give me that.

172
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:03,817
我很好奇
Just out of curiosity,

173
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:06,487
如果我想放下一件事
if I were to let something go,

174
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:07,888
应该怎么做呢?
how would I do that?

175
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,858
我也不知道... 就试着想想别的事吧
I don't know... just think about something else.

176
00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:14,328
我可以想针鼹嘛?
Can I think about the spiny anteater?

177
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,496
当然
Sure.

178
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:18,165
针鼹...
The spiny anteater...

179
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,168
从来不会背叛我而去帮Barry Kripke
never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke.

180
00:07:22,871 --> 00:07:25,539
一点用都没有
That didn't help at all.

181
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,509
你知道吗 有的时候人们会用视觉化的方式
You know, some people try visualization.

182
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,010
那要怎么做?
How does that work?

183
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:33,847
这样
Okay,

184
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:36,884
把你纠结的问题想象成一支笔
imagine your problems are a pen.

185
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:39,753
好的
Okay.

186
00:07:39,755 --> 00:07:42,323
现在想象你自己正拿着那支笔
Now imagine you're holding that pen.

187
00:07:46,962 --> 00:07:48,963
好
Okay.

188
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:52,199
现在张开手掌 放开那支笔
Now open your hand and let it go.

189
00:07:52,201 --> 00:07:54,268
可是我才刚拿到啊
But I just got this pen.

190
00:07:55,637 --> 00:07:58,238
上面刻了我名字的首字母什么的呢
It's got my initials on it and everything.

191
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,907
听着
Look.

192
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,445
Sheldon 没那么难的
Sheldon, this isn't that hard.

193
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:09,283
没准按我说的做你才能帮到我
I may have a better way that you can teach me.

194
00:08:09,285 --> 00:08:10,718
怎么做?
How?

195
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,388
如果我告诉你 在过去的几个月里
What if I told you that over the past few months

196
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,391
Any一直偷偷在用你做实验
Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles

197
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:20,394
对比你的智商和她实验室里大猩猩的智商 你会怎么想?
to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?

198
00:08:22,597 --> 00:08:24,098
什么? 她才没有用我做实验
What? She didn't give me any puzzles.

199
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,233
你确定?
Are you sure?

200
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:32,573
天啊 我拼不起来这把剪刀了
Boy, I just can't seem to get these scissors back together.

201
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:34,375
你能弄好吗?
Can you do it?

202
00:08:35,844 --> 00:08:37,177
该死
Darn it.

203
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,579
我眼睛里进了东西
There's something in my eye,

204
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:42,249
我得按大小把这些硬币分类
and I need to sort these coins by size.

205
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,584
能帮个忙吗?
Can you help?

206
00:08:48,757 --> 00:08:51,025
嘿 Penny?
Penny?

207
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:53,027
我想吃这个香蕉
I really want to eat this banana,

208
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,030
可是它卡在这个迷宫盒子里了
but it's stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.

209
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,169
我勒个去!
Son of a bitch!

210
00:09:02,171 --> 00:09:03,570
这样就对了
Okay, that's great.

211
00:09:03,572 --> 00:09:05,406
现在 别去想它了
Now, let it go.

212
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:17,718
真不敢相信你们居然对比我和大猩猩的智商!
I can't believe you were testing me against a chimp!

213
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,387
跟我没关系 是Amy在测试
Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you.

214
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:22,656
我是支持你的
I was rooting for you.

215
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,227
对了 香蕉那个你做的真不错
Good job on that banana box, by the way.

216
00:09:27,229 --> 00:09:29,997
她为什么要这么做?
Why would she even do this?

217
00:09:29,999 --> 00:09:31,999
她在用大猩猩做一系列实验
She's been conducting an experiment on apes

218
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,901
让大猩猩们解决各种难题
where they're given various puzzles to solve.

219
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:36,570
我很惊讶于这些问题的复杂程度
I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles

220
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,906
并且认为 有些问题是人类都很难解决的
and thought some humans wouldn't be able to solve them.

221
00:09:38,908 --> 00:09:42,276
后来Amy说 "想不想让实验变得更有趣?"
That's when Amy said, "Want to make this interesting?"

222
00:09:43,311 --> 00:09:44,812
"更有趣?"
"Make this interesting"?

223
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:46,413
你们拿我打赌?
You bet money on me?

224
00:09:46,415 --> 00:09:47,748
不是 不是
No, no.

225
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,417
我们设计了个涉及你的实验
We designed an experiment involving you.

226
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,853
看见没? 是不是很有趣?
See? Now, isn't that interesting?

227
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:55,189
这哪里有趣
It's not interesting.

228
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:57,057
根本就是羞辱人
It's incredibly insulting.

229
00:09:57,059 --> 00:09:59,393
好吧 或许这会有帮助...
Okay, maybe this will help ...

230
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,795
想象你正拿着一支笔
imagine you're holding a pen.

231
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:06,333
别想太远 这笔很普通
Before you go too far, not a special pen

232
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:07,835
上面没有刻着你的名字...
with your initials engraved on it ...

233
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,403
不然接下去就很难放手了
that'll make the next part really hard.

234
00:10:09,405 --> 00:10:10,405
哦...
Oh...

235
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,406
够了
That's it.

236
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:12,407
出去!
Get out!

237
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,408
我不明白你为什么对我生气
I don't understand why you're mad at me.

238
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,076
你该生气的是Amy
You should be mad at Amy.

239
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,045
就跟我今天下午那样
Like I was this afternoon.

240
00:10:18,047 --> 00:10:19,713
嘿 你瞧瞧... 我放下这事了
Hey, look at that ... I let it go.

241
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:21,148
出去!
Get out!

242
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:25,219
- Penny?  - 怎么了?
- Penny?  - What?

243
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:28,188
我好像把笔落里面了
I think I left my pen in there.

244
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,460
我明白你为什么生气
I understand why you're upset,

245
00:10:33,462 --> 00:10:35,929
但他费了很大的劲才整顿好店面的
but he worked really hard to get the store ready.

246
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,399
而且这不过是套家具
And it's just furniture.

247
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,234
这是我妈的家具
It's my mom's furniture.

248
00:10:40,236 --> 00:10:42,236
它应该待在我长大的房子里...
It belongs in the house I grew up in...

249
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:43,737
旁边靠着一堆"电视指南"
next to that pile of TV Guides

250
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,740
放眼看去 对一个十岁小孩来说 就是
and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was

251
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,409
一幅高质量的编图艺术!
a quality piece of string art!

252
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,314
Howie 要是店开成了 Stuart有了收入来源
Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income,

253
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:56,650
就能搬出你妈的房子了
and he can move out of your mother's house.

254
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:58,585
看起来用套旧家具换这一切
Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price

255
00:10:58,587 --> 00:10:59,653
也挺划算的
to pay for that.

256
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,423
这是个好点子
That is a good point.

257
00:11:02,425 --> 00:11:04,058
但我娶你不是为了好点子
But I didn't marry you for good points.

258
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,492
我娶你为的是盲目地支持我
I married you to blindly support me

259
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,461
不管我有多么荒谬!
no matter how ridiculous I'm being!

260
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,632
这就是为什么我要重写我们的结婚誓言
This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.

261
00:11:16,104 --> 00:11:19,339
嗨 我们是来取漫画中心的订餐的
Hi, we're here to pick up an order for Comic Center.

262
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:20,808
好得 让我先查查
Sure, let me go check on that.

263
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,779
老兄 我... 我觉得那人是Nathan Fillion
Dude, I... I think that's Nathan Fillion.

264
00:11:26,915 --> 00:11:28,916
是啊 还真是
Oh yeah, look at that.

265
00:11:28,918 --> 00:11:31,351
他还把沙拉里的番茄挑出来了
And he's picking the tomatoes out of his salad

266
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,353
就跟我一样
just like I do.

267
00:11:33,355 --> 00:11:35,389
我一直觉得跟他心灵相通
I always did feel a connection with him.

268
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,159
我有个主意了
Oh, I have got an idea.

269
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:42,096
我们不拿他的番茄放eBay上卖
We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.

270
00:11:42,098 --> 00:11:46,100
不 如果我们请到电影"萤火虫"里的雷诺上尉
No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly

271
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:48,435
去Stuart的店里签售
to do a signing at Stuart's store,

272
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,870
那就酷毙了
that would be amazing.

273
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,205
的确很酷
That would be great.

274
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,973
那我们去跟他谈谈?
So should we go talk to him?

275
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:54,374
我不知道
I don't know.

276
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:57,044
我是说 如果他人不友善 我日后就看不下
I mean, if he's not nice, it's gonna make it hard for me

277
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,213
- 任何他演的剧了  - 什么?!
- to watch him in anything again.  - What?!

278
00:11:59,215 --> 00:12:02,216
那个... 那个演琼·斯诺的人是个混蛋
The... the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk.

279
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,684
我们不照样看"权力的游戏"
We still watch Game of Thrones.

280
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:06,286
他是个混蛋因为你跟他撞尾了
He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.

281
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:08,989
我分心了
I was distracted.

282
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,991
看到守夜人的一员开着绑着皮船的车
It's weird seeing a member of the Night's Watch

283
00:12:10,993 --> 00:12:12,526
很奇怪的
with a kayak strapped to his car.

284
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:15,229
去吧
Come on.

285
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:22,136
嗨 打扰一下 先... 先...
Hi, excuse me, s... s...

286
00:12:22,138 --> 00:12:23,470
我... 我不是有意打扰你
I... I don't mean to bother you,

287
00:12:23,472 --> 00:12:25,806
但我们是电影"萤火虫"的铁粉
but we're just really big fans of Firefly.

288
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:27,374
还... 还有"恐怖博士"
A... and Dr. Horrible.

289
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,309
哦 我觉得你们找错人了
Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake.

290
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,644
我不是演员
I'm not an actor.

291
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:32,980
别这么说
Don't say that.

292
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:34,481
我的意思是 你虽然不是Dame Judi Dench
I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,

293
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,150
但也挺厉害的
but you're pretty great.

294
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,555
哦 这下我明白了... 你们是把我认成内森·菲利安了
Oh, yeah, I get it ... you think I'm Nathan Fillion,

295
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,056
但我不是
but I'm not.

296
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,492
所以若不介意的话 我想把我的午饭吃完
So if you don't mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.

297
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:47,861
走吧
Come on.

298
00:12:47,863 --> 00:12:49,696
不好意思打扰了
Sorry to bother you.

299
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,698
不知道为什么他脾气这么差
Don't know why he's so grumpy.

300
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,034
我有次被认成了"少年派"里的主角
I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once,

301
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,403
现在还沾沾自喜呢
and I'm still floating.

302
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,909
Sheldon 是我
Sheldon, it's me.

303
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:02,911
哦 嘿
Oh, hey.

304
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,745
你... 你刚刚看见了吗?
D... did you see that?

305
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:08,315
我... 我知道怎么自己开门了
I... I figured out how to open the door all by myself.

306
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,787
我或许该丢几把笼子边的粑粑庆祝下
Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage to celebrate.

307
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,291
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

308
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,560
我知道了你一直在暗中给我解谜测试
I know you've been giving me secret puzzle tests.

309
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:24,231
SHeldon 开门
Sheldon, open the door.

310
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:25,899
不行
I can't.

311
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,902
我光着身子呢
I'm naked.

312
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:30,904
我刚刚看见你了
I just saw you.

313
00:13:30,906 --> 00:13:33,207
等等
Hang on.

314
00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:35,776
马上开门
Open the door now.

315
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:37,444
- 哦 嘿  - 把裤子拉好
- Oh, hey.  - Pull up your pants!

316
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:41,949
没什么大不了的
It's not a big deal.

317
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:45,152
我一直在大学生上做这样的测试
I run tests like this on undergrads all the time.

318
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:46,820
如果你去大学里填个表
If you fill out some paperwork at the university,

319
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:49,122
我可以给你五块钱
I can get you $5.

320
00:13:49,124 --> 00:13:50,791
我不要五块钱
I don't want $5.

321
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,359
我要的是尊严
I want my dignity.

322
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:55,395
那你说怎么样 十块钱?
So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?

323
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:59,433
- 谢谢你  - 谢谢
- Thank you.  - Thanks.

324
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:03,503
- 再次抱歉  - 没事
- Sorry again.  - No problem.

325
00:14:03,505 --> 00:14:06,673
你... 你确定不是他吗?
A... are you sure you're not him?

326
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:07,841
呃 你可以放心得说
Uh, you can tell us.

327
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:10,444
我们是科学家 不是狂热的粉丝
We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.

328
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,981
那好吧
All right, fine.

329
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:15,449
我就是他
I'm him.

330
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:18,785
而你在熟食店独自用餐
And you're eating alone at a deli.

331
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:20,988
我才不信... 你不是他本人
I don't buy it ... you're not him.

332
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,157
我就是想安静地吃顿午饭
I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace.

333
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,325
但我真是本人
But I really am him.

334
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:27,427
还有谢谢你们这些粉丝
And thank you very much for being a fan.

335
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:28,962
愿意的话 我们可以合个影
If you want, uh, let's take a picture.

336
00:14:28,964 --> 00:14:30,297
那太好了
That would be great.

337
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,431
太好了 谢谢
Great. Yeah, thank you.

338
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,766
来吧
You bet.

339
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,839
等等
Wait, hang on.

340
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:41,208
如果你真是Nathan Fillion
If you're really Nathan Fillion,

341
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,244
那么你在Firefly里 帽子那句台词是什么?
what's the line from Firefly about your bonnet?

342
00:14:45,647 --> 00:14:47,981
"以我美丽的花般的软帽起誓 我将会终结你"
"I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you."

343
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:51,785
完全正确 就是这句
That's it, that's the line.

344
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,787
尽管如此...
Although...

345
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,490
我也知道这句台词... 但这并不代表我就是Nathan Fillion
I knew the line ... doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

346
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:59,893
到底还想不想要合影了?
Do you want the picture or not?

347
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:02,729
我只想和真的Nathan Fillion合影
I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.

348
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:06,066
那么跟一个烦躁版的Nathan Fillion
How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion

349
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:09,303
合一张影怎么样呢?
but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?

350
00:15:11,906 --> 00:15:12,939
怎么样?
What do you think?

351
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,642
发Facebook倒是够了
Eh, it's good enough for Facebook.

352
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:25,218
真不敢相信他们能做出这种事
I can't believe they did that.

353
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
是啊... 简直是侮辱
I know ... it's so insulting.

354
00:15:27,222 --> 00:15:28,889
有一回 他们让我想办法
At one point, they had me figure out

355
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,858
把一根香蕉从一个盒子里取出来
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.

356
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,861
等等 Sheldon给过我一个藏着香蕉的盒子
Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.

357
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:37,064
他也给我做了测试
He was testing me, too.

358
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,066
不可理喻
Unbelievable.

359
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,901
黑猩猩怎么能够取出香蕉?
And how could a chimp even solve that?

360
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,402
那也太难了
That was impossible.

361
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:44,771
真的吗? 你没拿出来?
Really? You couldn't get it out?

362
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:49,710
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,712
这店太棒了
Wow, the store looks great.

364
00:15:51,714 --> 00:15:53,714
你们俩在测试我们吗?
So you guys were testing us both?

365
00:15:53,716 --> 00:15:54,748
你们到底怎么回事?
What is the matter with you?

366
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,249
他们俩就是
Eh, what's the matter with them is

367
00:15:56,251 --> 00:15:57,851
自以为聪明过人
they think they're so smart they don't care

368
00:15:57,853 --> 00:15:59,519
根本不考虑是否伤害了别人
if they hurt other people's feelings.

369
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,188
- 好像是  - 不是这样的
- Sounds like us.  - That's not true.

370
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,526
我还是不明白你为什么生气
I still don't understand why you're upset.

371
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:09,529
所有题目你都比猩猩解得快
You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.

372
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,199
除了Barnabas 但是他服用了Adderall
Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.

373
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:12,199
{\an8} 一种治疗注意力缺失 多动症的药物

374
00:16:13,701 --> 00:16:16,203
对不起 但真的让我抓狂啊
I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.

375
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:18,538
能不能别再想了?
Can you please just let it go?

376
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,507
我能帮你
Oh, I can help you with that.

377
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:24,311
想象你拿着一根很普通的笔
Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen.

378
00:16:26,381 --> 00:16:29,383
而你最爱的那根 很安全地躺在你的口袋里
While your favorite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.

379
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,787
保持住
Hold that thought.

380
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:34,789
你好?
Hello?

381
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,057
我怎样才能弥补你?
How can I make this up to you?

382
00:16:37,059 --> 00:16:39,726
答案藏在这里
The answer's in this puzzle box.

383
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,895
看看你能不能打开
Let's see if you can open it.

384
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,734
你至少可以告诉他家具的事
You could have at least warned him about the furniture.

385
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:49,803
搬的时候我就这么说过
That's what I said when we moved it.

386
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:51,304
你帮他搬的?!
You helped him?!

387
00:16:51,306 --> 00:16:54,307
没有 Stuart自己选的那些抱枕
No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.

388
00:16:58,513 --> 00:17:00,514
你还好吧?
Hey, you okay?

389
00:17:00,516 --> 00:17:01,948
不好
Uh, no.

390
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,116
怎么了?
What's wrong?

391
00:17:03,118 --> 00:17:05,118
嗯...
Um...

392
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,621
我妈妈去世了
my mom died.

393
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,723
什么?
What?

394
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:12,058
呃...
Uh... 

395
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,061
我姑姑打来的
that was my aunt.

396
00:17:15,063 --> 00:17:18,064
妈小睡了一下
Ma took a nap.

397
00:17:18,066 --> 00:17:19,399
就再没醒来
She never woke up.

398
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:22,436
哦我的上帝 Howie
Oh, my God, Howie.

399
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,807
节哀顺变
I'm so sorry.

400
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:29,409
我们能做点什么?
What can we do?

401
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:34,114
我不知道
I don't know.

402
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,320
我能说句话吗?
May I say something?

403
00:17:40,322 --> 00:17:41,655
现在别 Sheldon
Not right now, Sheldon.

404
00:17:41,657 --> 00:17:42,989
但应该能安慰他
But I think it would be comforting.

405
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:44,925
- 哥们...  - 没事 说吧
- Buddy...  - No, it's okay.

406
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,827
什么?
What?

407
00:17:47,862 --> 00:17:50,530
我爸爸去世的时候
When I lost my own father,

408
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,732
没有任何朋友陪伴我
I didn't have any friends to help me through it.

409
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,635
但是你有
You do.

410
00:18:01,142 --> 00:18:04,211
我真以为他会说 "随它去吧"
I really thought he was gonna say, "Let it go."

411
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,694
好的 谢谢 Bernadette
Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

412
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,362
一路平安
Travel safe.

413
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,032
好 拜拜
Okay, bye.

414
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,534
他们订了机票
They booked a flight.

415
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,769
在去机场的路上
They're heading to the airport now.

416
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,571
Howard怎么样?
How's Howard holding up?

417
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,905
还挺得住
He's hanging in there.

418
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,540
你没事吧 Stuart?
How are you doing, Stuart?

419
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:33,910
还是不敢相信她走了
Still can't believe she's gone.

420
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:36,880
是她收留了我
I mean, that woman took me in.

421
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,616
要不是她 我... 我还流落街头呢
If it wasn't for her, I... I would have been homeless.

422
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,618
我们中总会有人收留你的
One of us would have taken you in.

423
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,920
是嘛 我怎么没印象有人邀请过我
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

424
00:18:45,723 --> 00:18:48,391
但是 我... 我很欣慰是现在这个结果
But, you know, uh, I... I'm glad it worked out the way it did

425
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:52,462
因为我能认识这个好人
because I got to know this wonderful person.

426
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,131
是啊
Yeah.

427
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,032
Wolowitz女士真的很与众不同
Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.

428
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,301
我刚来美国时
When I first moved to America,

429
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,837
Howard是我唯一的朋友
Howard was my only friend.

430
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:04,074
她非常热情好客
She made me feel so welcome in her home.

431
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:07,077
因为那几年
Which says a lot, because, those first few years,

432
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,746
她以为我是花匠
she thought I was the gardener.

433
00:19:10,882 --> 00:19:12,549
每次我见到她
Whenever I saw her,

434
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:15,552
她都说我太瘦了 要喂我东西吃
she'd say I was too skinny and try and feed me.

435
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,089
她也喂我东西吃
She did that to me, too.

436
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,458
别跟我抢
Don't take this away from me.

437
00:19:22,593 --> 00:19:25,095
我不烦她的呐喊
I didn't care for her yelling.

438
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,098
但是我再也听不到了
But now that I'm not going to hear it again,

439
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,666
我好难过
I'm sad.

440
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,668
我一会儿可以冲你喊
If you want, I can yell at you later.

441
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:35,805
你喊不出那感觉
It won't be as good.

442
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,243
我们干个杯吧
Let's have a toast.

443
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,014
敬Wolowitz女士
To Mrs. Wolowitz.

444
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,859
我们共同的...
A loving mother...

445
00:19:49,863 --> 00:19:51,864
亲爱的妈妈
to all of us.

446
00:19:51,866 --> 00:19:53,733
我们会想念你的
We'll miss you.
