00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:04,837
Miss?

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,839
I have to apologize.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,741
Well, not to me, but I'm
sure the Amish are pissed

4
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:13,312
that you're gaying up their look.

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,848
I don't have enough money for the tip.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,217
Weird. You survive the diner chili,

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,920
and it's the waitress that kills you!

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:24,290
But I can tip another way.
I'm a psychic.

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,591
So, uh, you already know

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,194
where they're gonna find your body.

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,296
Oh, please. I die in a bridge collapse

12
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:32,498
you have nothing to do with.

13
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,234
I can tell you your future.

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,895
Ha! You're wrong. I don't have one.

15
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,073
See the guy in the booth over there?

16
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,809
Jared "Leto Himself Go"?

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,912
He just offered to read
my future as my tip!

18
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:49,573
Ha! You don't have one.

19
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,219
Miss, let me read your palm.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,256
Sir, coming over here right
now is not a good idea.

21
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,491
We don't like to be
stiffed by strangers.

22
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,161
In six months, maybe,
but we're not there yet.

23
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,296
I'm a legit psychic.

24
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,131
I predicted long hair was coming back

25
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:09,401
in time to have long hair when it did.

26
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,702
Okay. You can read my palm.

27
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,304
I could use some good news.

28
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:15,841
I could also use some
hand moisturizer... sorry.

29
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:18,210
I see two Ms?

30
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,679
You bitch! Have you been
holding out on M&M's?

31
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,818
Ooh! Is it the male model

32
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:28,053
I'm managing

33
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:32,524
who's also making it with Max?

34
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,593
Actually... I see a small failure.

35
00:01:40,098 --> 00:01:44,636
I take it back. You are good!

A crumble of the crumble?

No chewing, no enjoying. Just swallow.

48
00:02:24,204 --> 00:02:26,038
Spit that out!

49
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,206
No!

50
00:02:27,207 --> 00:02:29,174
I said spit that out!

51
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:32,711
You're a model now! Shame on you!

52
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,046
Bitch, he's starving.

53
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,816
He's not eating, is he?

54
00:02:37,817 --> 00:02:39,551
I don't want the Stay
Puft Marshmallow man

55
00:02:39,552 --> 00:02:42,888
showing up at my
girlfriend's photo shoot.

56
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:45,290
I haven't eaten anything since Tuesday!

57
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,492
This morning, he tried
to swallow his toothpaste,

58
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:49,461
but I was right there to stop him.

59
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,929
Good, honey.

60
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,864
That kind of heartlessness
is why I've decided

61
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:54,800
to make you the manager
of our hot new location

62
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,967
of the High.

63
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:59,471
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!

64
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,940
Someone's finally realizing
my full potential,

65
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:04,209
and it's not me!

66
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,711
Will I be able to make
Max head pastry chef?

67
00:03:06,712 --> 00:03:09,447
And where is this new location?

68
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,249
Well, right now, everything's under wraps

69
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,385
the way my face was six months ago.

70
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,787
But as manager, you can
hire your own staff,

71
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:17,555
and I'll even let you poach Max.

72
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:19,591
I'll also tell you

73
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:21,593
the new spot is amazing.

74
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:24,195
It's international. It's a hub.

75
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,431
I'm talking major flagship.

76
00:03:26,432 --> 00:03:28,700
Honey, I get that you're happy,

77
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:30,969
but enough with the eye contact.

78
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,171
No one can look me in the eye.

79
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:36,875
I'm the Medusa in Chanel.

80
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:38,643
Max doesn't let me look her in the eyes

81
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:39,944
during sex either.

82
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:42,146
I told you, eye contact's extra.

83
00:03:42,147 --> 00:03:45,216
Max, did you hear that?

84
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:46,951
Major flagship!

85
00:03:46,952 --> 00:03:50,621
Uh, did someone just
call me a major flag?

86
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:52,323
I think you did, and if I don't get to

87
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,292
go to the new place with you two,

88
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,860
I'm telling HR.

89
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,630
That's Hector Rodriguez, my therapist.

90
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,632
Would you be interested
in coming to the new High

91
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,367
as part of our team?

92
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,902
If you say "part of our team" again,

93
00:04:04,903 --> 00:04:06,237
I'll rethink the whole thing.

94
00:04:06,238 --> 00:04:07,471
I'll take it.

95
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:09,040
But I have to be upfront with Max.

96
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,575
I don't like it in the back.

97
00:04:10,576 --> 00:04:14,612
Which, by the way, is what
I say to all my dates.

98
00:04:14,613 --> 00:04:16,413
Samesies!

99
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,517
Well, this is great news.

100
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,519
How about we celebrate
with a piece of pie?

101
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,586
No!

102
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,760
Earl, we have great news.
Guess what it is.

103
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,796
No, don't. Okay, guess.
No, don't. Yes, guess, guess!

104
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,064
Can we hurry this along?

105
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,400
My cousin is on <i>Maury Povich</i> today,

106
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,870
and I wanna find out if he's the father.

107
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:43,207
'Cause then I can stop
paying child support.

108
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,609
Sorry. She's a little amped.

109
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,645
She hasn't had good news to share

110
00:04:47,646 --> 00:04:49,313
since we found out the washing machine

111
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:54,323
in our basement takes buttons.

112
00:04:54,324 --> 00:04:55,791
Sure, you do.

113
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,394
And I'm playing center
for the New York Knicks!

114
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,462
Have you seen the Knicks lately?

115
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,965
He can only help.

116
00:05:02,966 --> 00:05:04,967
Well, according to my time card,

117
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:06,902
I've been here for six hours already,

118
00:05:06,903 --> 00:05:09,338
so I'm gonna head back
and catch some Zs.

119
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:12,506
The Mattress is all yours, Max.

120
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:17,279
Hey, everybody.
We weren't expecting company.

121
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,181
I came by

122
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,183
to discuss wedding details with Oleg

123
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:23,719
while we had intercourse.

124
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,688
What is this, the Bunny Ranch?

125
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,623
Baby, I think these are yours.

126
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,562
Yeah.

127
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:37,199
Yeah. Why, thank you, honey.

128
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,468
Can we just make it a general rule

129
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:43,171
that there's no
fornication in the diner?

130
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:45,674
Or in Han's apartment, ever.

131
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:49,044
Okay, Max and I have some
really exciting news.

132
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:52,012
Yeah, yeah.
We know all about the buttons.

133
00:05:54,115 --> 00:05:55,684
Oleg!

134
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:58,720
I think you crushed my
seating arrangement!

135
00:05:58,721 --> 00:06:01,021
I'd like to think so.

136
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,026
So, back to us.

137
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,795
How 'bout back to work?

138
00:06:06,796 --> 00:06:08,897
Max and I...

139
00:06:08,898 --> 00:06:11,132
Need to do some work!

140
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:13,200
There. End of news.

141
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,606
Where are you running off to so fast?

142
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:21,876
Is someone having a
sale on smaller heads?

143
00:06:21,877 --> 00:06:25,380
I'm too small, I'm too big... pick one!

144
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:26,981
Here's our big news.

145
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,816
You are looking at the manager

146
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:32,687
and the head pastry chef of
the brand-new High location.

147
00:06:32,688 --> 00:06:35,857
Actually, he's looking at our kneecaps.

148
00:06:35,858 --> 00:06:37,992
Okay, so we're going with too small.

149
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:42,430
If you two quit the diner,
how will I ever replace you?

150
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,465
Unless I hire... literally anyone else!

151
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,270
No, Han, we still have
to work here at night.

152
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:51,038
We have more debt
than Jada Pinkett-Smith

153
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,642
has excuses for Will not being home.

154
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:56,677
But at the new High,

155
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:58,346
we're gonna be the big bosses

156
00:06:58,347 --> 00:06:59,847
calling all the shots.

157
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:02,750
Yes, yes... by day.

158
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:06,886
But by night, you'll be
the coleslaw's bitch.

159
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,790
Don't listen to him.

160
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:12,093
Clearly, Han just resents our success.

161
00:07:12,094 --> 00:07:17,063
I know! Why can't women ever
just be happy for each other?

162
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,409
Wow, that is really hot.

163
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,677
Yeah.

164
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:34,013
The milder salsa's right here.

165
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:35,562
Listen... oh!

166
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:37,663
Do girls eat now?

167
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:42,970
Wow! Lena Dunham changed everything!

168
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,606
Listen, which one of you
is sleeping with the model?

169
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:47,541
I know one of you said you were,

170
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,543
but I don't listen when you talk.

171
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:52,346
[muffled] She is.

172
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:54,681
This is a massive ad campaign,

173
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,884
and I don't know how else to say this,

174
00:07:56,885 --> 00:08:00,287
but I need his penis to look bigger.

175
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:02,189
Oh! Yeah...

176
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,892
It gets nervous when
you shine a light on it.

177
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,695
Sometimes I hear her coaxing
it out of its crawl space

178
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,731
with treats.

179
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,132
Well, do something.

180
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,900
I haven't touched one since college,

181
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,537
and even then it was just
to look under it for my keys.

182
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,006
Max, take him off set. Be professional.

183
00:08:20,007 --> 00:08:21,842
How professional can I be?

184
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:24,511
She's asking me to fluff his nutter.

185
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:27,172
Yo, Nash! Break time.

186
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,249
So... Marie.

187
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,985
Did Joe tell you about
my big new job promotion?

188
00:08:31,986 --> 00:08:33,987
Of course she did. We're lesbians.

189
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:36,923
Talking is most of what we do.

190
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,558
It's why we rule daytime.

191
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:42,429
(Irish accent) Eh... pardon me.

192
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,100
You, maybe. That coat... never.

193
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,968
I'm lookin' for someone.

194
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:52,839
You also look like an extra
from<i> Angela's Ashes.</i>

195
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,440
But this is a private shoot,

196
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:57,710
as in we're shooting someone's privates.

197
00:08:57,711 --> 00:08:59,479
I'm looking for me son.

198
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,284
Okay, people! The
groundhog's outta the hole!

199
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:07,453
Six more inches of winter.

200
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:09,889
That's him! That's me boy!

201
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,290
Ma?

202
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:12,925
Huh?

203
00:09:12,926 --> 00:09:15,228
Ma, how did you know I was in New York?

204
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,130
Aw, no, you saw me in
the<i> Today Show</i> window,

205
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,898
didn't ya?

206
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,701
You checked into "America" on Facebook,

207
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,369
you bleedin' idiot.

208
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,639
I flew all the way and been
lookin' for you day and night

209
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,742
in this dirty, God
forsaken city for a week.

210
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:31,644
I'm takin' you home.

211
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:33,946
Ma'am, Nash can make his own decisions.

212
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:35,281
He's a grown man.

213
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:38,017
Yep. Thanks to my handiwork.

214
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:41,287
He's no grown man. He's just now 18.

215
00:09:41,288 --> 00:09:45,224
He's got his prom next month!

216
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,359
I can't believe it!

217
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,794
I had sex with a teenager!

218
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,530
Who am I, Woody Allen?

219
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,400
Roman Polanski?

220
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:58,037
Pretty much any of your
big-time '70s movie directors?

221
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,806
You had sex with me innocent child?

222
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:02,708
Uh, not so innocent.

223
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:04,310
He made me blush a few times,

224
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,846
and I have two positions named after me.

225
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,648
Well, that's that.

226
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,419
You've seen the last of
big booby dirty girl here.

227
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,456
I'd object, but when you're
right, you're right.

228
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,625
But Ma, I like New York.

229
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,628
People want to take
pictures of me willy here.

230
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:24,129
This is all me fault.

231
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,565
I should have never let you
watch that<i> Magic Mike.</i>

232
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:31,203
That's great.

233
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,871
I don't have a model now.

234
00:10:32,872 --> 00:10:34,806
I'm Seal.

235
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:37,543
Wait until I tell Joe about this.

236
00:10:37,544 --> 00:10:40,279
How can you not know how old he is?

237
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,382
Uh... what can I say?
We're a typical couple!

238
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:47,551
He lied about his age, and I
pretended he was interesting.

239
00:10:49,554 --> 00:10:51,456
Okay, Max, when Joe gets here,

240
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:52,658
I'm just gonna tell her

241
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,626
that me managing an underage twink

242
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:57,162
has nothing to do with me
managing her restaurant

243
00:10:57,163 --> 00:11:00,132
which sells overpriced twink... ies.

244
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:02,601
Yeah. I'm sure she'll
be professional about it all.

245
00:11:02,602 --> 00:11:03,869
Professional?

246
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,504
Yesterday, she slapped a woman in here

247
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,305
for wearing cheap heels.

248
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:10,441
I know. My face is still red.

249
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:12,744
Here she is.

250
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,079
Good morning, Joe!

251
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,580
Hey, ladies.

252
00:11:15,581 --> 00:11:18,183
Well, obviously, you're both fired.

253
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,818
Obviously.

254
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,052
Can I keep the hat?

255
00:11:21,053 --> 00:11:23,021
You are not gonna want this back.

256
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:25,957
My head sweats like a
watermelon at a picnic.

257
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,860
Please don't fire us
over the Nash situation.

258
00:11:28,861 --> 00:11:30,829
It was out of our hands.

259
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,797
Actually, it was in her hands,

260
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,833
and it was only 18.

261
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:37,235
You two embarrassed my girlfriend.

262
00:11:37,236 --> 00:11:39,137
And embarrassment in
the lesbian community

263
00:11:39,138 --> 00:11:41,105
is worse than not owning a dog.

264
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:44,175
It's worse than dating Anne Heche.

265
00:11:44,176 --> 00:11:47,979
Oh, my God. We committed a Heche crime.

266
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,914
How can we make it better?

267
00:11:49,915 --> 00:11:52,383
Just get that kid back to
the photo shoot tomorrow,

268
00:11:52,384 --> 00:11:54,385
and we're back in business.

269
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,920
And Max, next time,

270
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:59,190
stay out of his barely legal business.

271
00:11:59,191 --> 00:12:01,092
Done. Don't know how, but done.

272
00:12:01,093 --> 00:12:02,493
You won't be sorry.

273
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,729
Just get him back,
'cause I gotta tell ya...

274
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,964
Marie's crying face?

275
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,965
Not for me.

276
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,151
Well, coleslaw...

277
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,586
just when I thought I was out,

278
00:12:20,587 --> 00:12:23,823
you pulled me back in again.

279
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:26,158
Max, don't tell the coleslaw that.

280
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,260
Don't give it that power.

281
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,596
My plan to get Nash back will work.

282
00:12:30,597 --> 00:12:32,865
We still have a bright, bright future.

283
00:12:32,866 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes! By day.

284
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,970
Han!

285
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:39,316
Do you want to spend another night

286
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,684
in this coleslaw bucket?

287
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,019
No. And had I not been able to

288
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,687
roll myself out to the street,

289
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,348
I might have suffocated!

290
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,895
Nash and his mom will be
here any minute, Max.

291
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:55,098
Do you really need to
expose 60% of your boobs?

292
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:56,500
It's not up to me.

293
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:59,535
These girls have a life of their own.

294
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:06,710
The right one just started
a Fleetwood Mac cover band.

295
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:08,345
You know how I know?

296
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:12,080
'Cause when I take my bra
off, it goes its own way.

297
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,853
Do you really think you
can get Nash's mother

298
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,688
to change her mind when they come in

299
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:19,889
to pick up the rest of his stuff?

300
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,224
Yes, I do.

301
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,692
Because she and I have a lot in common.

302
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,794
I may not be Irish, but I'm dirt poor,

303
00:13:24,795 --> 00:13:28,097
and I'm living with someone
who drinks way too much.

304
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,866
(Oleg) Max, look.

305
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:31,034
All those purple post-its

306
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,436
are Sophie's friends and family.

307
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,438
My family's nowhere to be seen!

308
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,602
It's like I'm looking at
the last U.S. census!

309
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:40,571
Hey, girls. Come over here.

310
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:43,607
We need your help with the seating chart.

311
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:45,809
Yeah. You know, planning
a wedding is more work

312
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,913
than waxing Oleg's back
during a full moon.

313
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,082
Sophie, I have my own issue right now.

314
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,117
Okay. Then Max can
help me with the chart

315
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:57,620
while you go worry about
your obviously thinning hair.

316
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:00,857
Uh, full disclosure...

317
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,226
the last time someone asked me
to help them with something,

318
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:06,329
I free-based half their beard off.

319
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,199
[chime]

320
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,967
I just got a text from Nash.

321
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:14,170
He's here? I'll go get him a kid's menu.

322
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:15,405
They're not coming.

323
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:18,641
His mom found the racy
pictures I sent him.

324
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,744
"Flying out of JFK tomorrow.

325
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,113
Taking the morning Aer Lingus"?

326
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,715
A little morning "Aer Lingus"?

327
00:14:25,716 --> 00:14:29,785
Isn't that what got Max in
trouble in the first place?

328
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,989
Okay, well, we just have
to go to the airport

329
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,591
and stop them.

330
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:36,426
I'll buy us plane tickets
and then return them,

331
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:40,362
like I do with shoes or Tom
Cruise does with wives.

332
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:44,367
Jackets and shoes off!

333
00:14:44,368 --> 00:14:46,936
And make sure you check
all your pockets.

334
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:50,472
Don't make me shut this airport
down for a piece of gum.

335
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:55,811
This line is longer than
the movie<i> Gone Girl.</i>

336
00:14:57,513 --> 00:15:02,318
What does TSA stand for?
"Time Stands A-still""

337
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,987
That's cute. Never
heard that one before.

338
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,523
Most people just go with
"This Sucks Ass."

339
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,694
Max, please don't yell out again.

340
00:15:11,695 --> 00:15:13,462
People get very jumpy in airports.

341
00:15:13,463 --> 00:15:16,132
Oh, what? It's not like I
screamed, "I have a bomb""

342
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,268
Miss, will you step over here, please?

343
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:22,204
Oh, I was kidding. I don't have a bomb.

344
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:25,607
But I have been known to... be DA bomb.

345
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:28,677
Max!

346
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,079
Please, please, if we step away,

347
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,914
we'll lose our place in line.

348
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:34,984
I know it sounds like we're
here to blow up a plane,

349
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,052
but we're really just here
to stop an underage kid

350
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,656
she had sex with from
leaving the country.

351
00:15:40,657 --> 00:15:42,758
So I should just come over there now.

352
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:44,994
Yep. You just been hand-picked

353
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:48,730
to join the "I don't
trust you" dance party.

354
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,502
May I see your tickets?

355
00:15:53,503 --> 00:15:56,205
Nice day. I like your hair.

356
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:58,507
Thanks. We're allowed to be creative

357
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:02,111
from the neck up.

358
00:16:02,112 --> 00:16:05,013
Ooh! You traveling to Paris.

359
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:07,015
First-class.

360
00:16:07,016 --> 00:16:09,451
In those jeans?

361
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:12,254
You got first-class tickets to Paris?

362
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,889
Are you insane?

363
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,157
My fingers did it.

364
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:17,092
It was rich girl cellular memory.

365
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,127
And if we're not going anywhere,

366
00:16:19,128 --> 00:16:20,963
why can't we not go to Paris?

367
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,798
And why can't we not go to the Louvre?

368
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:27,166
And why can't we not
stay in the penthouse

369
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:31,003
Is it too late for me to
say I don't know her?

370
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,472
Ma'am, are you carrying any explosives?

371
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,207
I had leftover Chipotle for breakfast.

372
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,510
Does that count?

373
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,946
It does to whoever's
sitting next to you.

374
00:16:43,482 --> 00:16:45,617
(woman, French accent)
Air France flight 113

375
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,452
will now begin boarding at gate 24.

376
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:48,920
Max! That's our flight.

377
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,390
(bad French accent)
Air France, flight 113.

378
00:16:51,391 --> 00:16:52,758
Ooh! I bet on the plane,

379
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:55,060
they'll have caviar and Bellinis.

380
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,828
You know what won't be on the plane?

381
00:16:56,829 --> 00:16:58,697
Us!

382
00:16:58,698 --> 00:16:59,931
We're not going!

383
00:16:59,932 --> 00:17:01,533
Have you been smoking the half joint

384
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,969
I have hidden in my bra?

385
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,637
You have a joint?

386
00:17:05,638 --> 00:17:08,406
Bank account? Ha!

387
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,009
You went through security with pot?

388
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,678
I went through third grade with pot.

389
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,880
There he is. There's Nash.

390
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,649
I'm sure his mom is asking

391
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,086
if he can visit the cockpit
and meet the pilot.

392
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,922
Wow. He's young.

393
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:25,590
So young, Bruce Jenner has been a woman

394
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:27,792
for most of his life.

395
00:17:27,793 --> 00:17:30,528
Nash! Please.

396
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,864
You can't go. Our entire lives depend on

397
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,699
you finishing that photo shoot.

398
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,602
Nash Terrence O'Brien,
you're not going anywhere.

399
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,804
Or I'll take you over
my knee right here.

400
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:42,073
Well, he likes that.

401
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,808
Well, you...

402
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,911
You are just loose as
a goose, aren't ya?

403
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,716
Again... when you're
right, you're right.

404
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:55,620
Max, let me talk to Mrs. O'Brien.

405
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:56,725
Go up to the gate.

406
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,456
Ask what movie they're
showing on their flight.

407
00:17:58,457 --> 00:18:00,124
Okay, but if they're showing anything,

408
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:02,326
and I mean<i> anything</i>

409
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:04,929
from Mr. Adam Sandler...

410
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,264
I'm getting on the plane too.

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,569
Please. I'm begging you.

412
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,237
You don't know me. I'm a proud woman.

413
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:15,239
The only other time I ever begged

414
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,309
was to get off of P. Diddy's yacht.

415
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,745
I mean, a party shouldn't
be three days long.

416
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:22,380
Miss, you can save your silly breath.

417
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,415
I'm taking him home.

418
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:27,918
Would passenger Maeve O'Brien
please report to the gate desk?

419
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,354
Oh, Nash, maybe they're bumping us up

420
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:33,891
from the last coach row to the
second to the last coach row!

421
00:18:33,892 --> 00:18:36,360
I knew I'd be rewarded for
not having any abortions

422
00:18:36,361 --> 00:18:39,295
in spite of me circumstances.

423
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:42,299
Grab Nash... let's get out of here

424
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,801
while I got her distracted.

425
00:18:43,802 --> 00:18:46,003
Max, you did that? How?

426
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:48,539
I no longer have the
half a joint in my bra.

427
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,042
You bribed an airline
employee with a joint?

428
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,879
Pain? Oh, you really gotta
stretch out for that.

429
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,781
Max, this is kidnapping.

430
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,451
Oh, he's not that young.
When I was his age,

431
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:03,153
I had already robbed
three Blockbuster videos.

432
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,254
What's Blockbuster video?

433
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:10,194
Oh, my God, I screwed a baby.

434
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:12,696
Okay. I'm gonna text Joe
and tell her we have Nash

435
00:19:12,697 --> 00:19:15,165
in our custody. No, I'd better call.

436
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:19,002
That text won't play well at our trial.

437
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:21,838
I'm sorry I didn't tell
ya I was so young.

438
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:23,840
But honestly, I didn't think it mattered

439
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,308
since you're so immature.

440
00:19:27,944 --> 00:19:30,613
I know you are, but what am I?

441
00:19:31,515 --> 00:19:33,116
Okay, so Joe was really impressed

442
00:19:33,117 --> 00:19:35,452
with the kidnapping, and
she gave us our jobs back.

443
00:19:35,453 --> 00:19:36,953
But Nash, you've been replaced.

444
00:19:36,954 --> 00:19:38,388
They found another model

445
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,390
who wouldn't give them
any parent trouble...

446
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:43,026
a well-hung orphan.

447
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:44,861
A well-hung orphan.

448
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:47,964
Well, the Lord gives and the Lord takes.

449
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,533
So what now?

450
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:52,202
Well, you go back to Ireland
and brag to your friends

451
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:55,205
about having sex with
someone who once had sex

452
00:19:55,206 --> 00:19:59,209
with Axl Rose's best friend's son.

453
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:00,510
Good-bye, Max.

454
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:03,346
Later, Nash Potater.

455
00:20:03,347 --> 00:20:06,416
You know, I think I'm gonna miss him.

456
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:10,353
Especially since kids eat
free at Quiznos before 6:00.

457
00:20:10,354 --> 00:20:12,789
Ugh! Let's get out of here.

458
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,390
The only good thing about airports

459
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:16,826
is leaving them for someplace better.

460
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,929
Max, next time we're here,
I'm gonna take you to Paris.

461
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,898
Well, first take me to the bathroom.

462
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:24,500
I've had to pee since our
tram hit that pothole.

463
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:27,270
Well, at least we're gonna be
working somewhere with class.

464
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:28,871
I wonder where it is.

465
00:20:28,872 --> 00:20:33,076
Joe said it's a real hub,
flagship, international.

466
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:37,512
Yeah. It's gonna be
international terminal 8!

467
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:40,583
What?

468
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,318
Here?

469
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,554
We're working here?

470
00:20:44,555 --> 00:20:46,322
I've got to find out
who I brutally murdered

471
00:20:46,323 --> 00:20:49,158
in a previous life and
make it up to him or her.

472
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,394
This sucks! The one place

473
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:54,864
no one will<i> ever</i> give us a ride to work!

474
00:20:54,865 --> 00:20:59,268
(female announcer) Final boarding
for Air France, flight 113.

475
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,370
Of course it is.

476
00:21:01,371 --> 00:21:04,540
Look at the bright side.
These days, most planes

477
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,109
don't even make it to where
they're supposed to go.

478
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,679
(announcer) Paging first-class
passengers Caroline Channing

479
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,847
and Max Black.

480
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:14,515
Those rich bitches are so lucky!
