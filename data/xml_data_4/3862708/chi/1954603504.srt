1
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:06,754
好了 我们要出门了... 回见
Okay, we're headed out... See you later.

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:07,921
先别走
Before you leave,

3
00:00:07,923 --> 00:00:10,290
能帮我一起测试下抗噪耳机的功效吗?
could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?

4
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:11,292
当然没问题
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,459
好
Okay.

6
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:15,263
开始
Go ahead.

7
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:18,265
嘿 能听见我说话吗?
Hello, can you hear me?

8
00:00:21,137 --> 00:00:22,803
Sheldon 其实我已经有两年没有
Sheldon, I haven't changed the filter

9
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:24,905
给滤水壶换过滤器了
in the water pitcher in two years.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,612
Bernadette给你起了个绰号叫"纯真可乐达"(一种无酒精果汁)
Uh, Bernadette's nickname for you is the virgin pina colada.

11
00:00:34,483 --> 00:00:38,752
你那张乔治・卢卡斯（著名导演）的亲笔签名其实是我伪造的
Your George Lucas autograph is really a “me” autograph.

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,891
好吧 事实上有一次我懒得走路
Yeah, well, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall,

13
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,626
就直接用了你的牙刷了
so I used your toothbrush.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,830
还有一次你在睡着了的时候
Ooh, and one time when you were asleep,

15
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,498
Amy完全脱光了...
Amy totally took off her...

16
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,700
所以你是我心中的最佳室友
And that's why you're the best roommate ever.

17
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:58,772
真遗憾我没听到前面的部分
Now I'm sad I didn't hear it.

18
00:00:58,774 --> 00:01:01,241
你要那副耳机干嘛?
So what do you need the headphones for?

19
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,810
我已经努力了数月
Well, I've been struggling for months

20
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,045
来想出一个不会使质子衰变的
to come up with a theory of dark matter

21
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,713
暗物质理论
that doesn't make protons decay.

22
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:08,415
我希望通过改善自己的工作环境
I'm hoping to finally tackle it

23
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,417
来搞定它
by optimizing my work environment.

24
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:15,055
瞧 我已经让我的茶水处在最佳饮用温度了
See, I've got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature.

25
00:01:15,057 --> 00:01:17,591
我还买了绒布四角裤
Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts

26
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:18,959
让我的小屁屁更加地温暖舒适
to keep my tushie toasty.

27
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,460
还有 最后还有这张
And then, oh, last but not least,

28
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,397
鼓舞人心的猫咪海报
this inspirational cat poster,

29
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:25,432
我在上面ps了物理学家理查德・费曼
improved with the reassuring face

30
00:01:25,434 --> 00:01:27,668
那张可靠的脸蛋儿
of physics renegade Richard Feynman.

31
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:29,668
{\an8} (坚持住)

32
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,774
这就是昨晚他非要你带他去"办公室用品店"的原因?
Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?

33
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:35,976
我不想谈那件事了
I don't want to talk about it

34
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:38,212
我们走了 这就是你的天下了
There, the place is all yours.

35
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,179
恩 玩的开心哦
Yeah, have fun.

36
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,148
我会的 没有什么能比
Oh, I will... nothing more fun

37
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,716
研究能改写历史的科学理论更好玩的了
than a paradigm-shifting evening of science.

38
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,153
你就知道洗澡时给我涂肥皂
And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.

39
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,121
拜拜
Bye.

40
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:50,724
好
Okay.

41
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:52,926
开工了
Here we go.

42
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,563
质子衰变
Proton decay.

43
00:01:58,033 --> 00:01:59,900
质子衰变
Proton decay.

44
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,569
质子衰变
Proton decay.

45
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,405
质子衰变
Proton decay.

46
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,976
质子衰变
Proton decay.

47
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:11,144
质子衰变
Proton decay.

48
00:02:11,146 --> 00:02:12,412
嘿 我们回来了
Hey, we're home.

49
00:02:14,984 --> 00:02:16,884
有任何进展了吗?
Any progress?

50
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,985
就你们这样不断地打扰
How could there be?

51
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:19,853
人家怎么可能有进展?
With these constant interruptions.

52
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:25,525
我爱他 但是如果他坏了 我们也还是别换新的
I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.

53
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:30,397
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 * 
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

54
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,734
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! * 
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

55
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,369
* 地球开始降温 * 
* The Earth began to cool *

56
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:37,905
*  自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 * 
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

57
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,574
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 * 
* We built the Wall * * We built the pyramids *

58
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:43,243
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 * 
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery *

59
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,145
* 一切由大爆炸开始 * 
* That all started with a big bang *

00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,060
你在干啥呢?
What are you doing?

64
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,295
该出发了
It's time to go.

65
00:03:00,297 --> 00:03:02,497
我今天不去上班了
I'm not going to work today.

66
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,432
你想知道为什么吗?
And would you like to know why?

67
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,469
因为 你花了整晚研究暗物质
Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working

68
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:09,504
却没有找到一个突破点 心情很郁闷了
on dark matter and didn't make a breakthrough,

69
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:11,439
然后现在你又觉得自己更换研究领域是个大错误
and now you're worried you made a huge mistake switching fields,

70
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,408
所以你就打算闷闷不乐地坐一整天?
and you're gonna sit around and sulk all day?

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,444
像个大婴儿一样
Like a big old baby.

72
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,347
如果有需要 打电话给我
Call me if you need anything.

73
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:26,188
我已经宅在屋里好久了
I've been cooped up in here too long.

74
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,191
也许呼吸下新鲜空气会好点
Maybe I need some fresh air.

75
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,410
Penny啊?
Penny?

76
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:50,745
Penny啊?
Penny?

77
00:03:51,682 --> 00:03:53,715
Penny啊?
Penny? 

78
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:57,052
额 怎么了?
Ugh, what?

79
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,920
你听上去很痛苦的样子
You sounded in distress.

80
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,622
我还以为你遭遇了什么不幸
I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you.

81
00:04:00,624 --> 00:04:02,157
比如说 谋杀
Like a murder.

82
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,126
或者是在和leonard啪啪啪呢
Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.

83
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:08,463
哦 我只是在做烦人的运动
Oh, I'm just doing this awful workout.

84
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,664
我讨厌它
I hate it.

85
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,067
恩 那既然你讨厌它 为什么还要做呢?
Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it?

86
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,868
不过这个问题放在
Although I could ask the same question

87
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,637
你和leonard的啪啪啪的事儿上也可以
about coitus with Leonard.

88
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:18,406
我不知道... 我想我只是喜欢这种讨厌的感觉
I don't know... I guess I like that I hate it.

89
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:20,041
它让我更加努力
It makes me work harder.

90
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,876
澄清一下...
And to clarify...

91
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,745
我说的是运动 Sheldon 
The exercise, Sheldon.

92
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:26,982
你不去收拾下去上班吗?
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?

93
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:28,483
我今天不去了
I'm not going.

94
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,884
你想知道原因吗?
Would you like to know why?

95
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,520
原因是你因为昨晚没有任何进展而难过了
Uh, you're sad about not getting anything done last night,

96
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,856
所以你打算今天呆坐着自己生气?
so you're gonna sit around and pout about it?

97
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,660
看来我没有自己以为的那么神秘
Boy, I'm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am.

98
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,963
我发明了一个游戏
I invented a game.

99
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:43,665
- 你想玩吗?  - 当然
- You want to play?  - Sure.

100
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:46,067
这个游戏叫做"是Emily还是Cinnamon"
It's called "Emily or Cinnamon"

101
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,404
我告诉你一些Raj说的话 你来猜猜 
I give you actual quotes I've heard Raj say,

102
00:04:49,406 --> 00:04:53,642
这些话他是对他女朋友说的还是对他的狗狗说的
and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog.

103
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,247
开始吧 尽情嘲笑我
Go ahead, make fun.

104
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:00,282
你不会让我丢脸的
You can't embarrass.

105
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:01,716
我已经有了一个漂亮的女友了
I've got a beautiful girlfriend

106
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,619
还有了一只爱我爱到会喝我洗澡水的狗狗
and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater.

107
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,125
好了 下面这句话他是对Emily还是Cinnamon说的:
Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon:

108
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:12,861
"要知道 你不在床上时
"I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely

109
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,562
我真是寂寞如雪"
when you're not in it."

110
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,271
这游戏的发展我不太喜欢
I may not be liking this game so much.

111
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,308
是Cinnamon 再来
Cinnamon. Give me another one.

112
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,677
好 Emily还是Cinnamon:
Okay, Emily or Cinnamon:

113
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,712
"快看快看 我给咱们买了情侣毛衣!"
"Check it out, I got us matching sweaters!"

114
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:33,248
我们都收到那张圣诞贺卡了... 是Cinnamon
We all got the Christmas card... Cinnamon.

115
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:38,086
男人可以同时宠爱一个女人和一只宠物
You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet.

116
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,120
这又不奇怪
It's not strange.

117
00:05:39,122 --> 00:05:40,088
噢 是Emily
Ooh, Emily.

118
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,290
我听他这么对Emily说过
I heard him say that to Emily.

119
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,327
嘿 我以为你在家呢
Hey, I thought you were staying home.

120
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,729
恩 刚才在 但是和Penny说话之后
Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny,

121
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:49,331
我明白了一些事
I realized something.

122
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,701
我... 首先 你俩这段感情里
I... first, she's trying much harder to stay attractive

123
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,003
她比你更努力地保持身材
in this relationship than you are.

124
00:05:59,176 --> 00:06:00,642
第二...
And second...

125
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:03,578
我的研究没有进展可能是因为
the reason I may not be progressing in my research is

126
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,248
我为自己营造的环境太过于舒心了
I've created too pleasant of an environment for myself.

127
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,583
什么意思?
What do you mean?

128
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:11,086
根据耶基斯和多德森的经典心理实验表明
According to a classic psychological experiment

129
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:14,422
要想让一个人表现出最佳状态
by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance,

130
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:17,559
必须营造出一种高效率焦虑状态
one must create a state of productive anxiety.

131
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:21,262
所以我希望你们都能帮我一下
So I'd like to ask you all to do something for me.

132
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:23,098
让我保持清醒
Keep me on my toes.

133
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,266
狠狠虐我
Just throw me off my game.

134
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:29,371
基本就是 你们用尽方法让我的生活无比悲惨
E... Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable.

135
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,508
等等
Hold on.

136
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,076
我们有什么好处吗?
What's in it for us?

137
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,178
- 我想...  - 好的 我们答应了!
- Well, I suppose...  - Okay, we'll do it!

138
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,288
搞定
Done.

139
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,923
33秒
33 seconds.

140
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,825
好了 那是我们的基线
Okay, that'll be our baseline.

141
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,527
我本不想告诉你
You know, I don't want to tell you

142
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:55,029
怎样做好自己的工作 但是一只老鼠走出迷宫后
how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze,

143
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,965
都会获得一点食物奖励
it gets a food pellet.

144
00:06:56,967 --> 00:07:00,668
老鼠的大脑也会被用镊子夹出来
It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.

145
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,705
那最后一餐你就给它吃那么点食物?
And his last meal was a food pellet?

146
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,206
你真是个禽兽
You're a monster.

147
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,310
好了接下来 我们要用
All right, next, we're gonna introduce

148
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:11,813
一种焦虑诱导刺激 测量你的压力水平
an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels

149
00:07:11,815 --> 00:07:13,548
再看看它如何影响你解决问题的效率
and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.

150
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,582
很好
Very well.

151
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,318
祝你好运... 我可是很淡定的人
And good luck... I'm a pretty laid-back guy.

152
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,355
准备好了?
Ready?

153
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:21,890
开始
Begin.

154
00:07:44,281 --> 00:07:45,914
你为什么戳爆它?
Why'd you pop it?

155
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:48,183
抱歉 我本来是要戳你的心脏的
I'm sorry, I was aiming for your heart.

156
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,821
我知道你不喜欢
Look, I know you don't like it'

157
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,355
但是这是实验的关键
but that's the point of the experiment.

158
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:55,924
我要刺激你
I need to irritate you

159
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:58,226
才能找到你的最佳焦虑区
to find your optimal anxiety zone.

160
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,728
既然你说了不能挠痒痒 不能放波尔卡舞曲
And you said no to tickling, polka music

161
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,931
也不能看着我吃香蕉
or watching me eat a banana.

162
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:05,733
有谁是横着吃香蕉的?!
Who eats them horizontally?!

163
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,204
我妈说好女孩就该这么吃
My mother said that's how good girls do it.

164
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,577
也许这就是在浪费时间
Perhaps this was a waste of time.

165
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,212
嘿Sheldon
Sheldon,

166
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,147
你是一个卓越的科学家
you're a remarkable scientist.

167
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:21,583
耐心一点... 我保证
Just be patient... I'm sure you'll find the breakthrough

168
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,917
你能找到突破点
you've been looking for.

169
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,419
谢谢
Thank you.

170
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,054
而且就算你只老老实实做研究
And if you only do solid research

171
00:08:26,056 --> 00:08:29,123
没有突破性发现
instead of making a groundbreaking discovery,

172
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,625
那又怎样呢?
what does it matter?

173
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,994
"老老实实做研究"?!
"Only do solid research"?!

174
00:08:32,996 --> 00:08:35,964
哦... 我来找你帮忙 你却侮辱我?!
Uh... I come to you for help, and you insult me?!

175
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:38,032
我以为你至少能...
I thought the least that you would do would be...

176
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:40,034
看 你的焦虑水平达到理想值了
Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone.

177
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,369
真的?
Really?

178
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:43,004
真棒啊
Oh, that's fantastic.

179
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,272
等等 下降了
N... Now, wait, they're dropping.

180
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,406
为什么会下降呢?
Why are they dropping?

181
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,375
因为它们升高了你很开心
Because you're happy they're elevated.

182
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,177
哦 真可恶!
Oh, that is infuriating!

183
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,712
看 看 又回来了
Ooh, look, they went back up again.

184
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:51,679
太好了
Terrific.

185
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:53,481
不 又下降了!
Oh, no, they went back down!

186
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:59,654
好了 伙计们 你们想玩什么游戏?
All right, guys, what game do you want to play?

187
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:00,889
我来看看
Let's see.

188
00:09:00,891 --> 00:09:04,626
不如玩 "Emily还是Cinnamon"
How about "Emily or Cinnamon"

189
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:07,562
你不觉得这样很奇怪吗
You know what? I think it's a little weird

190
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:09,397
你总是能记住我说的话
that you remember me saying all these things.

191
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,901
可能是... 你嫉妒我的感情生活吧
Maybe the truth is... you're jealous of all my relationships.

192
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,737
可能是吧
Oh, maybe I am.

193
00:09:15,739 --> 00:09:17,438
谁不想成为那个女孩
Who wouldn't want to be the girl,

194
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,441
也有可能是狗狗 可以听到你这么说:
or possibly dog, to hear the words:

195
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:22,410
"你真幸运
"You're so lucky.

196
00:09:22,412 --> 00:09:24,512
可以拥有这一头闪亮无比的秀发"
You have the shiniest hair".

197
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,984
这个有点难
That is a tough one.

198
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,220
我...我知道他给她俩都梳过头
Uh, I...I know he brushes both of them.

199
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,457
- 先生们...  - 嗯
- Gentlemen...  - Yeah.

200
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:39,627
我找到了你们能刺激我的最好方案
I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me.

201
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:43,498
我希望你们能做我的专业挑刺员
I'd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners.

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,900
从现在起 只要我说什么
From now on, when I make an assertion,

203
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:47,335
你们就挑什么刺
I need you to challenge it.

204
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,805
所以无论你说什么 我们只要否定它就好了?
So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?

205
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:51,973
是的
Yes.

206
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:54,842
- 你觉得这样能起作用?  - 是的
- And you think that's going to help?  - Yes.

207
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,445
但是我觉得根本没用
Well, I don't think that's gonna help at all.

208
00:09:57,447 --> 00:09:58,880
会的
Oh, no, it will.

209
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:02,383
通过让我的大脑保持运转 我会更专注
See, by keeping my mind engaged, I'll become more focused.

210
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:04,786
Howard说得对... 没用的
Howard's right... that'll never work.

211
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,421
前提就不要在跟我争了
Stop fighting me on the premise.

212
00:10:06,423 --> 00:10:08,022
这是有科学测试有效的
It's scientifically valid.

213
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,624
我提出观点
I'm going to advance propositions,

214
00:10:09,626 --> 00:10:11,192
你们只管来质疑
I just want you to challenge me.

215
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,062
你肯定不希望我们这么做
I don't think that's what you want at all.

216
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:16,764
怎么会 我当然希望
Why, of course it's what I want.

217
00:10:16,766 --> 00:10:19,300
如果我不希望的话 我怎么又会说我希望
Why would I say it's what I want if it's not what I want?

218
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,537
因为你心口不一
Because it is what you want, and it's not what you said.

219
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:27,041
我就这么点点要求 你们居然都不帮忙
I ask you for one simple thing, and you can't even do it.

220
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,610
- 我们可以帮啊  - 好啊 那就来吧
- Yes, we can.  - Yeah, well, then do it.

221
00:10:28,612 --> 00:10:30,244
不
Nah.

222
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:33,047
你们真差劲
You guys are the worst.

223
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:38,086
谢谢 真的管用
Thank you, I think that was helpful.

224
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:49,682
季度销售冠军可以	
So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter

225
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:51,250
获得夏威夷双人游
gets a trip for two to Hawaii.

226
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,819
对你和Leonard来说 太浪漫啦
That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.

227
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,188
显然你没有见过他
Yeah, clearly you haven't seen him on the beach

228
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,090
带着金属探测器在沙滩上走来走去
walking around with his metal detector.

229
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:00,726
我要是能去夏威夷
If I were going to Hawaii,

230
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,395
我要一整天都泡在Keck天文台
I'd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory.

231
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,064
你知不知道 那里的望远镜
Did you know that the telescopes there have

232
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,599
分辨率比哈勃还高?
better resolution than the Hubble?

233
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,033
真的?
Really?

234
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,102
你想去夏威夷吗?
Want to go to Hawaii?

235
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:12,071
女士们?
Ladies?

236
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:13,806
女士们...
Ladies...

237
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:15,541
女士们?
Ladies?

238
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:17,076
进来
Come in.

239
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,445
女士们
Ladies.

240
00:11:19,447 --> 00:11:20,946
什么事?
What's up?

241
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:23,282
你们可能已经知道了 我在试验
As you may know, I've been experimenting

242
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,017
提高焦虑水平
with elevated anxiety levels,

243
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,252
我想
and I thought,

244
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,220
还有什么比参加一场
what better way to increase my discomfort

245
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,922
没品的未经删减的三俗谈话
than to subject myself to an evening

246
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,491
更好的方式呢?
of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?

247
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,130
你到底以为我们都聊什么?
What exactly do you think goes on here?

248
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,732
嗯...
Well...

249
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,433
你们在进行一场不适于有异性
conversations that you wouldn't be comfortable having

250
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,068
参与的谈话
in front of the opposite sex.

251
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,870
比如 谁的宫颈最好
You know, who has the best cervix.

252
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,108
哪种姨妈巾最风靡
Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now.

253
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,645
怎么啪啪男神的屁屁
Men's buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them.

254
00:11:54,282 --> 00:11:56,715
我们在聊Penny的工作
We were talking about Penny's job.

255
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,651
她的工作有多困难?
And how difficult it is to do

256
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:00,719
她这么膨胀 暴躁 脑子抽筋
when she's bloated, cranky and crampy?

257
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,821
继续
Continue.

258
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,592
Sheldon 我们都是正常人
Sheldon, we are just people.

259
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:08,794
我们跟你们聊的东西都一样
We talk about the same things you guys talk about.

260
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:11,563
你们聊狼人可以游泳吗?
You talk about if werewolves can swim?

261
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:13,232
Leonard说可以
See, Leonard says yes,

262
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,935
但是我认为这决定于他被咬之前
but I say it depends on if the human could swim

263
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:16,902
是不是会游泳
before he was bitten.

264
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,570
你怎么看?
What do you think?

265
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:22,441
我们来聊聊大姨妈吧
Let's just talk about our periods.

266
00:12:22,443 --> 00:12:24,043
不 等一下
No, hold on.

267
00:12:24,045 --> 00:12:27,046
游泳是犬科动物的本能
All canines instinctively know how to swim.

268
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,748
狼人怎么能不会游泳?
Why wouldn't a werewolf have the same abilities?

269
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,418
因为他们不是完完全全的狼
Well, they're not a hundred percent wolf.

270
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,187
它们是狼人 半狼半人
They're a werewolf... that's only part wolf.

271
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,289
就像拿苹果跟橘子比
It's like comparing apples to oranges.

272
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,091
谢谢
Thank you.

273
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:41,794
技术层面上讲 是苹果在月圆之夜
Oh, and technically, it's apples that turn into were-oranges

274
00:12:41,796 --> 00:12:43,495
变成了橘子
when the moon is full.

275
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,832
嗨 真有趣
Hey, this is fun.

276
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,934
什么时候你们不一起大姨妈综合征的时候我们再来玩
We should do it sometime when you aren't all PMS'ing.

277
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,502
拜拜
Bye.

278
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,546
怎么回事?
What is going on?

279
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,814
噢
Oh.

280
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:04,483
我要维持住焦虑水平
Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level,

281
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:08,253
所以需要达斯・维达 小丑 和哥斯拉的吼叫声
so I'm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzilla's roar

282
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:10,022
来锁定那个有效区域
to keep me in that sweet spot.

283
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:14,460
我尝试过把泰勒斯威夫特也混进去
Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix,

284
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,662
可没想到我这么爱她
but turns out I love her.

285
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,667
拜托戴耳机啊
Well, at least listen to it through headphones.

286
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:23,669
我要睡觉 晚安
I'm trying to sleep. Good night.

287
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:26,205
哎!
Boy!

288
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:30,709
泰勒是对的... 黑我的人会不停地\黑黑黑黑
Taylor was right... haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.

289
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:36,548
你最近工作很忙嘛
You've been working so much lately,

290
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,617
很高兴你没有忘记约会之夜
I'm glad you didn't forget about date night.

291
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:40,152
当然
Of course.

292
00:13:42,423 --> 00:13:43,423
Sheldon啊
Sheldon.

293
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:44,990
嗯
Yeah.

294
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,893
也许你应该把本子放下 来跟我说话
Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.

295
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,928
我可以双线程
I can do both.

296
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,598
哦不 我的大脑可是最优配置
No, my brain is working at optimal capacity.

297
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,633
哦不 我可以边跟你聊天
No, I can have a conversation with you

298
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:58,771
边解决暗物质质子的衰减问题
and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.

299
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,240
好吧 今天过得怎么样?
Fine. How was your day?

300
00:14:01,242 --> 00:14:02,741
言之有理
Oh, you said it.

301
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,578
Sheldon啊
Sheldon.

302
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,247
Sheldon 我很担心你
Sheldon, I'm worried about you.

303
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,982
你不吃东西
You're not eating,

304
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,984
你几天不睡
you haven't slept in days,

305
00:14:11,986 --> 00:14:14,753
而且 说实话 那帽子都臭了
and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell.

306
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,556
我知道啊
I know.

307
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,259
他已经取代了哥斯拉 成为了我焦虑的源泉
It's replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.

308
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,933
现在是Emily一票 Cinnamon一票
Okay, so it's one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon.

309
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,035
Penny 由你来打破僵局
Penny, you're the tiebreaker.

310
00:14:33,007 --> 00:14:34,473
再说一遍
Say the quote again.

311
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:38,777
"我们都是天秤座 太好了"
"It's just so perfect that we're both Libras."

312
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:46,218
哇 好难
Wow, this is hard.

313
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,252
我选Cinnamon
I'm gonna say Cinnamon.

314
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,354
- 猜对啦!  - 耶!  - 拜托!
- Yes!  - Yes!  - Come on!

315
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,391
这是最后一次 我发誓
That was the last one, I promise.

316
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:53,625
再也不玩了
We won't play anymore.

317
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:55,060
谢谢
Thank you.

318
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,296
要知道一旦被她发现 她可是要伤心的
'Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings.

319
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,132
是伤Emily的心吗?
Emily's feelings?

320
00:15:00,134 --> 00:15:02,000
是Emily的
Yes, Emily.

321
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,969
- 漂亮!  - 猜得好!
- Nice!  - Yay! Good job!

322
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,406
随便你们 Sheldon去哪了?
Whatever. Where's Sheldon?

323
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,640
去约会了
Date night.

324
00:15:08,642 --> 00:15:10,342
Amy一定会觉得很无聊
Mmm, that can't be much fun for Amy.

325
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,845
今天上班的时候 他喝了生平第一罐红牛
You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull.

326
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:13,879
出什么事了?
What happened?

327
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,214
他绕着圈儿
He chased a squirrel

328
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:17,216
追了会儿松鼠 然后...
around the quad for a while and...

329
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:20,352
然后就在我车里吐了起来
then threw up in my car.

330
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,490
难道你们不觉得该劝他停下来了吗?
Don't you think you should make him stop all this?

331
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,925
我不知道... 他也没碍着别人
I don't know... he's not really hurting anybody.

332
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,996
把呕吐物从手套箱铲出来的又不是你
You didn't have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.

333
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,764
他可是完成了不少工作
He is getting a lot of work done.

334
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,501
还对质子衰退提出了很独到的见解
He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.

335
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:39,171
他要是攻破这个 这可是改变了历史啊
Wow, if he cracks that, it's a game changer, guys.

336
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:41,206
它将彻底颠覆我们
It'll completely redefine our understanding

337
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,875
对物理世界的理解
of the physical universe.

338
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,612
嗯 的确会
Hmm, it would.

339
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,181
好了 继续"Emily"还是"Cinnamon"的游戏
Okay, back to "Emily or Cinnamon"

340
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:55,120
"一个小姑娘怎么吃得下这么一大块牛排"
"How can such a little girl eat such a big steak"

341
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:00,826
喂 Sheldon
Sheldon,

342
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:02,661
快把帽子摘了
I want you to take that cap off.

343
00:16:02,663 --> 00:16:06,698
你唠叨的口气 对我保持焦虑真有帮助
That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah.

344
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,034
但要是你能把声音放缓和十分之一
But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill,

345
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,670
那就真成了我的天籁之音
that'd really put the zip-a-Dee in my doo-dah.

346
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:14,206
不好意思 但我们说好
I'm sorry, but you know we agreed

347
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,941
约会夜不带工作的
not to bring work to date night.

348
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,377
就是这样 真是完美
There you go, perfect.

349
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:20,345
Sheldon 别闹了 我说真的
Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding.

350
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:23,182
把帽子摘了 把笔记本放一边
Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.

351
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:26,885
可我奋斗几个月后终于有所进展了
But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.

352
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:29,788
为了追求效率把自己逼疯不值得
You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.

353
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,723
我有吗?
Or do I, hmm?

354
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:34,092
牛顿著"数学原理"一书时
Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia

355
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,728
还以为自己是只穿山甲嘞
while convinced he was an armadillo.

356
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,096
没这回事
That's not true.

357
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:39,765
亦真亦假 谁知道呢
Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

358
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,633
我最近产生幻觉了
I have been hallucinating lately.

359
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:45,571
Sheldon 你不能再这样了
Sheldon, this has to stop.

360
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,106
你得去好好休息 保重身体
You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself.

361
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,943
Amy 我这几天的成果比我转战暗物质后
Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days

362
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:53,278
这么久以来的还要多
than I have since I made the switch to dark matter.

363
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,648
如果我停下来 一切都付诸东流怎么办?
What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?

364
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,385
你的想法和主意靠的是你的脑袋 不是你的焦虑
Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.

365
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,653
也许吧
Hmm, perhaps.

366
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,322
但我就不摘帽子
But I'm not taking the cap off.

367
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:06,258
折磨自己是一回事
It's one thing to make yourself miserable,

368
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,627
折磨你周围所有人是另一回事
but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.

369
00:17:08,629 --> 00:17:12,331
我最后命令你一次... 把帽子给我摘了
Now, I'm telling you for the last time... take the cap off.

370
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:13,966
哦!
Oh!

371
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,300
真的?
Really?

372
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:16,935
我要是不肯呢?
What if I don't?

373
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:20,305
另外 能等我吃完点心 再回答我吗?
And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?

374
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:23,976
然后她就把我赶出来了
And then she threw me out.

375
00:17:26,747 --> 00:17:29,014
我可是她的正牌男友
Me, her very own boyfriend.

376
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:31,717
我做的不过是试图让人类
When all I've done is try to help humanity reach

377
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,920
更深入地理解我们所生活的世界
a more profound understanding of the world we live in.

378
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:39,424
是啊 女人呐...
Yeah, well, women...

379
00:17:39,426 --> 00:17:41,293
你准备怎么做?
what are you gonna do?

380
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:46,565
我就知道你懂我的 亲爱的穿山甲牛顿
I knew you'd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton.

381
00:17:51,005 --> 00:17:53,672
好吧...
Okay...

382
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,008
到了
Here we are.

383
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:57,976
嘿
Hey.

384
00:17:57,978 --> 00:17:59,811
你又是演的哪出?
What are you trying to pull?

385
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,148
科学院的主席又不在这
The president of science isn't in here.

386
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,051
你先躺下来 他稍后就到
You lie down, he'll be here in a minute.

387
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,987
好吧
Okay.

388
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,156
我还以为你在骗我呢
Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me.

389
00:18:14,228 --> 00:18:15,894
现在 你也舒服舒服
Now, you just get comfortable.

390
00:18:15,896 --> 00:18:18,563
不不 安逸是魔鬼
No, no, comfort is the enemy.

391
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,865
你知道怎样才算舒服吗?
You know what's comfortable?

392
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:23,602
拖鞋 毛毯 还有熊猫抱枕
Slippers and blankets and panda bears.

393
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:29,007
想象一下画着理查德・费曼脸的熊猫
Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynman's face on it.

394
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:33,512
把车发动下 Leonard 到了采购海报的时间了
Warm up the car, Leonard, it's poster time.

395
00:18:33,514 --> 00:18:35,147
早上再去吧
Maybe in the morning.

396
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:36,581
嗯 你先睡会儿
Yeah, you get some sleep.

397
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,051
不 我还不想睡... 你不能逼我睡
No, I don't want to go to sleep... you can't make me.

398
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:40,519
你说得对 我们逼不了你
You're right, we can't.

399
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,787
对极了 你们逼不了
Yeah, darn straight, you can't.

400
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,322
别想哄一个成年人入睡...
Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep...

401
00:18:43,324 --> 00:18:46,024
# 猫猫软 #
# Soft kitty #

402
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:48,193
# 猫猫暖 #
# Warm kitty #

403
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,696
# 小小绒毛一团团 #
# Little ball of fur... #

404
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:53,031
这样没用的
That's not gonna work.

405
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:56,668
# 猫猫欢笑 猫猫睡觉 #
# Happy kitty, sleepy kitty #

406
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,636
# 喵 #
# Purr #

407
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:00,706
# 喵 喵 #
# Purr, purr. #

408
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,811
他虽然常常给人惹麻烦
You know, he can be a lot of trouble,

409
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:08,847
但我看他这么睡着
but when I see him lying here asleep like this,

410
00:19:08,849 --> 00:19:11,483
心想...
I just think...

411
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:14,720
拿个枕头直接盖在他脸上该是多容易
how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face.

412
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,769
哇 你看起来休息得不错
Wow, you look like you got some rest.

413
00:19:25,771 --> 00:19:27,738
哦 我感觉好多了
Oh, I'm feeling much better.

414
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,107
而且我现在无需人为制造焦虑感
And I've also been continuing to make progress

415
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,943
也可以继续出成果了
without artificially raising my anxiety levels.

416
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,612
我一打开车里的暖气 就有呕泄物喷出来
I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out,

417
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:36,981
所以我的焦虑... 可不小
so my levels... right up there.

418
00:19:36,983 --> 00:19:38,949
大家好
Hey, guys.

419
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:40,351
可以让Emily陪我们一起吃午饭吗?
Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?

420
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,652
- 好呀  - 没问题  - 当然
- Yeah, sure.   - Yeah, no problem.  - Of course not.

421
00:19:41,654 --> 00:19:44,588
听说你们大家在玩个小游戏
So I hear you guys have been playing a little game.

422
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,825
呃 我们只是随便玩玩
Well, um, we were just kidding around.

423
00:19:47,827 --> 00:19:50,527
Raj的细心温柔或许对你们来讲很好笑
Well, you may think it's funny that Raj is sweet and sensitive,

424
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,696
但我却觉得很性感
but I think it's sexy.

425
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,569
呃 为什么你嘴里有撮狗毛?
Ugh, why is there dog hair in your mouth?
