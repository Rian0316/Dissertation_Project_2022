1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,570
Why are you wearing
a Band-Aid?

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:06,638
Halley bit me.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,775
(laughs)
You got beaten up by a girl.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,910
Hey, that's sexist.

5
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:13,078
You're right.

6
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:15,748
(laughs)
You got beaten up by a<i> baby.</i>

7
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:19,184
Hi.
Hey.
Hey.

8
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,919
What you got there?
Oh, I grabbed a sandwich

9
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,320
at the food truck
out front.

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,189
Wait, n-now, hold on.

11
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,424
Tonight is Friday,

12
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:26,925
and I believe you know
what that means.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,162
That my fun, young life took
a drastic turn somewhere?

14
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:32,197
No.

15
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:34,232
But yeah.

16
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,235
No, that means it's
Chinese food night.

17
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,337
Yeah, and you have Chinese food.
So eat it.

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:42,307
But I can smell your pastrami.

19
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,608
And we can all hear
your complaining,

20
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:44,576
so no one's happy.

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,345
It does smell good.

22
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,613
Oh, it is.
I had one the other day.

23
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,282
(stammers)
What is happening?

24
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:52,484
Everybody's supposed to be
eating Chinese food.

25
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,252
Well, actually,
I believe the Chinese

26
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:55,587
may have invented
the sandwich.

27
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,989
Their dish "rou jia mo"
literally means

28
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,624
"meat between bread."

29
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,359
So, it looks like all
of us, including Penny,

30
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,894
are eating Chinese food.

31
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,697
Except for you, Sheldon.
You're eating crow.

32
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:08,700
I'm sorry, I think
you're forgetting

33
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,635
that the sandwich
was invented

34
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,772
by John Montagu,
the Earl of Sandwich.

35
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,074
Oh. The truck's called
"Pearl of Sandwich."

36
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:17,642
Now I get it.

37
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:21,613
All right, that smells too good.
I got to get one of those.

38
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,749
And I think you're forgetting
that there are written documents

39
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:27,385
of meat between bread
being eaten in China

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,321
during the Tang dynasty.

41
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:30,455
You know what,
I'll go with you.

42
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,657
And then maybe we just go home.

43
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,228
I think you're defining
bread very loosely.

44
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,729
If we go down that road,
where does it end?

45
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,898
Well, I would say
when we go to bed,

46
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,867
but you talk
in your sleep.

47
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,702
I don't want to get into this
with you right now.

48
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:46,238
We'll talk about this
when I'm asleep.

49
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,808
I don't want to talk
about it when you're asleep.

50
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:51,676
How come we can't
talk about it now?

51
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,178
Well, because I'm eating now.

52
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,647
Fine. How's your moo shu?

53
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,016
You know what?
It's great.

54
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,385
Wait, look at that.

55
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,822
Hmm. Well, maybe the Chinese
did invent the sandwich.

56
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,459
I guess you were right.

57
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:12,831

I can smell that food truck
from up here.

67
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,230
Just close the window
if you don't like the smell.

68
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,432
Of course I like the smell.

69
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,435
It's salt and fat.

70
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,771
My brain may be evolved,
but my tongue still wants

71
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,208
to pick up a club and drag
that truck back to my cave.

72
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,876
So, there's something
you like,

73
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,246
but it's also
driving you crazy.

74
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,814
Been there, doing it now.

75
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,518
No, it-it's a distraction.

76
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,886
How can I focus on my work

77
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:10,222
when all I can think about is
how much I want that sandwich?

78
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,623
So, go get one.

79
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:13,258
I can't just give in
to every urge I have

80
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,326
when I have it.

81
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,361
That's why I have
a rigid schedule.

82
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,029
It's bad enough I had to
give in to my urge

83
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,398
to create a rigid schedule.

84
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,201
You know, why don't I just
go down to the food truck

85
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,370
and ask them to move?

86
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,806
Why are you
taking cash?
No reason.

87
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,780
Oh, this is the life.

88
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,382
What could be better than this?

89
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,019
If you weren't wearing
one of my swimsuits.

90
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,921
I'll give it back.

91
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,756
(chuckles)
You know the rule--

92
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:49,261
once it touches hiney,
it's no longer miney.

93
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,029
You're such a prude.

94
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,431
Do you know all the things
this water's touching right now?

95
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,434
Well, I'm relaxed enough.

96
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,538
Hey, Howard, look.

97
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,574
What's that?

98
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,676
Huh.

99
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,112
Looks like someone's drone.

100
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:08,446
Oh, no.

101
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:10,415
Do you think it was spying on us
in the hot tub?

102
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,818
'Cause I'm only 40% of the way
to my beach bod.

103
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,987
One of the propellers
is broken.

104
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,455
It must have crashed.

105
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,557
Oh. Do you think
you could fix it?

106
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,694
Maybe. Should we try and
track down the owner first?

107
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,430
Yeah, that's probably
a good idea.

108
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,466
Anyone lose a drone?

109
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,435
Looks like it's ours.

110
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,337
Yay, we got a drone!
Shh.

111
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,574
(whispers): Oh.
Yay, we got a drone.

112
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,848
(sighs)
The pastrami truck moved.

113
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,486
That is the danger
of a restaurant on wheels.

114
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,722
No, apparently someone
complained

115
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,956
to the tenants association,

116
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,725
and they're not allowed to park
on our street anymore.

117
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,428
Who would complain about
something that everyone loves?

118
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,129
Oh...

119
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,565
Did you complain
to the tenants association

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,766
about the food truck?

121
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,602
Yes.

122
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,005
And they actually
took you seriously?

123
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,141
Oh, the tenants association
takes every complaint seriously.

124
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,277
Oh, great, because I'm about
to send them an e-mail

125
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,213
complaining about you.

126
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,248
(phone chimes)

127
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,151
Excuse me.

128
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,391
Wow.

129
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:30,395
Someone should have
spell-checked.

130
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,763
What is going on here?

131
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,631
You're the tenants
association?

132
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:37,035
(laughs): You should see
the look on your face.

133
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,703
You might want to
tell your wife

134
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,540
that there's no "Y"
in "pastrami."

135
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,312
Okay, that ought
to do it.

136
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,180
I've replaced the propeller

137
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,850
and reattached the
gimbal controller unit.

138
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,754
Dude, you're like
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i> for robots.

139
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,890
Also, why isn't that a show?

140
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,559
I just need to see
if I can re-sync

141
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:03,495
the controls to
this old remote.

142
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,763
We should name it.

143
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,532
The drone, or your
stupid robot show?

144
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,667
The drone.

145
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,469
The show's already got
a name--

146
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,572
<i>General Bot-spital.</i>

147
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:19,144
I got it working!
(chuckles)

148
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,412
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Oh, oh!

149
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,579
Let's play William Tell.

150
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:22,947
I'll put this bowl
on my head.

151
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:26,118
See if you can knock it off
without hitting me.

152
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,188
You read my mind.

153
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,790
What are you doing?

154
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:36,161
Either breaking a bowl
or breaking Raj's head.

155
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,830
Be careful, they don't
make that bowl anymore.

156
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,238
(chuckles)
It's a nice one.

157
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,241
Yeah. We found it in the yard
and fixed it up.

158
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,810
Aren't you worried there's
some kid out there

159
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,311
missing his drone?

160
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,446
Oh, please, Bernadette,

161
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,847
this is not
a children's toy, okay?

162
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,782
This thing's got
an HD camera on it.

163
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,217
Okay, then aren't you worried
there's some rich

164
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,719
Peeping Tom out there
missing his drone?

165
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,523
We asked around,
and no one claimed it.

166
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,826
Ha. I think we've
done all we can do.

167
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:10,562
Did you check the video card?

168
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,330
Maybe you can see where
it started off from.

169
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,300
What a great idea, honey.

170
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,137
So, let me get
this straight.

171
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,739
You are the president
of the tenants association?

172
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,877
President, only member,
and harshest critic.

173
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,880
I once gave myself
an official reprimand

174
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:32,217
for conducting a meeting
in the shower.

175
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,886
The steam warped my gavel.

176
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,655
Okay, so when I got a fine
for leaving my clothes

177
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,924
in the dryer for too long,
that was from you?

178
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,759
$14.99.

179
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,362
The exact price of a new gavel.

180
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,998
And the noise complaint
we got

181
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,033
for singing you
"Happy Birthday"?

182
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,170
As a friend, I was touched.

183
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,571
As a representative
of the building,

184
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:58,443
I thought that you should
pick a key and stick with it.

185
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,779
Hi.
Do you know he is the entire
tenants association?

186
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,015
No, but I'm not
surprised.

187
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,118
He's also the pope of a planet
he invented in hyperspace.

188
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,355
Why didn't you tell me?

189
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,290
'Cause I wanted to make sure
that you loved the man,

190
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,791
not the office.

191
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,761
You can't just declare
yourself president.

192
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,063
I didn't.
I called a meeting,

193
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,532
I was the only one to attend.

194
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,668
I nominated myself, and after
a pretty moving speech,

195
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:25,937
I voted myself in.

196
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,540
Well, if you can
vote yourself in,

197
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,774
then we can vote you out.
Yeah.

198
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,510
Fine. Make a motion
at the next meeting.
When is that?

199
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:34,112
It's the first Saturday
of every month.

200
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:36,047
Unless there's
an emergency meeting.

201
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:37,615
Then we call
an emergency meeting.

202
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,716
You really don't have to.

203
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,552
This is the first Saturday
of the month.

204
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,187
Okay, fine.
Then we vote you out.

205
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,255
Uh, uh, hold on.

206
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,557
Hold on. First,

207
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,826
we have to read the minutes
from last month's meeting.

208
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,629
Amy, would you do the honors?

209
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,565
Why not?

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,832
"Saturday, March 3rd.

211
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,268
"7:05, meeting called to order.

212
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,739
"7:06, president gets
shampoo in eye.

213
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,108
7:07, meeting adjourned."

214
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,477
Okay, can we
vote you out now?

215
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,114
Ah, very well. New business.

216
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,884
I move for a vote
of no confidence

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,586
in the president.
Yeah.

218
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:15,987
Two to one, you lose.

219
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,690
Not so fast. I believe
we have one tenant here

220
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,092
who has not made
her voice heard.

221
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,730
Oh...

222
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,300
We're waiting, fiancée.

223
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:33,204
Yeah, we're waiting,
best friend.

224
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,005
Yeah, we're waiting,

225
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,507
neighbor who needed a battery

226
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:40,378
and totally got one from me,
no strings attached.

227
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,414
I don't want to be
in the middle of this.

228
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,483
No matter which way I vote,
I'm either

229
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,752
a bad friend,
a bad fiancée,

230
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,888
or an ungrateful recipient
of a battery.

231
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,624
Next time I have a meeting
in the shower,

232
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:53,758
you're welcome to attend.

233
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,194
Sheldon. Sheldon for president.
I pick Sheldon!

234
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,068
Ugh, I can't believe my best
friend sided with Sheldon.

235
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,639
Can't believe my best friend
<i>is</i> Sheldon.

236
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,907
Ah, I should've taken
that gavel

237
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,943
and shoved it right down
this throat.
Ugh.

238
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,011
I would've gone the other way,

239
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,080
but it would've gotten
to his throat.

240
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,448
What?

241
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,683
Don't be mad at me.

242
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,051
I mean, I can't vote
against him.

243
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,653
Even when he's being crazy?

244
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,454
Well, what other times
are there?!

245
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,057
So you just let him get
away with anything?

246
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,892
Well, not anything.

247
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,727
But honestly,
pastrami sandwich

248
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,763
is not the hill
I want to die on.

249
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,631
It's not about
the sandwich.

250
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:34,766
It's about
the principle.

251
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,767
Yeah, principle.

252
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,336
And a little bit sandwich.
Yeah.

253
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,872
Look, there are a bunch of other
tenants in this building.

254
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:43,207
All you need is for one of them
to vote your way,

255
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,209
and then Sheldon's out
and I didn't betray him.

256
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,078
Hey, you know, that's
actually a good plan.

257
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:50,281
That you came up with
all by yourself.

258
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:54,085
Now, if you'll excuse me,

259
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,820
told Sheldon
I was going to the market,

260
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,990
so... I'm taking
some of your stuff.

261
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,968
I was never here.

262
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:15,073
Sometimes you don't see it
'cause she's next to Sheldon,

263
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,075
but she's pretty weird.

264
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,013
Okay. All hooked up.
Here we go.

265
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,215
I hope there's nothing
disturbing on there.

266
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,351
Like you two in a hot tub?

267
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,822
Hold on.
Now I'm getting a picture.

268
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,861
That's not very
much to go on.

269
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,131
Oh, that's plenty to go on.

270
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,000
We can't give up.

271
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,536
We got to find her.

272
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,106
You just want to find
her 'cause she's cute.

273
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,241
Not just because she's cute.

274
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,676
She also owns
a pretty expensive drone,

275
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,945
which means she has money
and doesn't mind wasting it.

276
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,149
And I... I like that in a woman.

277
00:11:58,184 --> 00:12:00,618
Do you see anything that could
help us locate her?

278
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:01,919
Hmm, let me have a look.

279
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,121
She's got eagle eyes,

280
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,389
always spotting continuity
errors in movies.

281
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:08,760
(chuckles)
It's not annoying at all.

282
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,628
Oh. There.

283
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,896
Right there.

284
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,331
Check out the pin
on her jacket.

285
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,266
Isn't that from
the comic book store?

286
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,234
Hmm, is it?

287
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,236
Hey, Howard, zoom in.
Oh.

288
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,606
Fine. Zooming in.
(whooshes)

289
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,176
Yeah, I know
you're being a jerk,

290
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,512
but it's actually helpful.

291
00:12:29,849 --> 00:12:31,015
Hi.

292
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,784
Hi. We're your neighbors
from downstairs.

293
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:33,985
We've met.

294
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,087
Remember?

295
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,989
I invited you to my housewarming
when I moved in.

296
00:12:38,024 --> 00:12:39,490
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

297
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,192
You know, it's been
a crazy couple months.

298
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:43,061
That was two years ago.

299
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,865
Welcome to the building.
Mm-hmm.

300
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,202
So, I-I'm running for president
of the tenants association.

301
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,670
I could really use your vote.

302
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,205
You said you were gonna stop by.

303
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,174
I bought a lot of food.

304
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,976
Anyway, meeting's tomorrow.

305
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,344
We really hope
you can make it.

306
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,213
I'll be there.
Oh, really?

307
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,983
Yeah. You should buy
a lot of food.

308
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,887
So, I'm running for president
of the tenants association

309
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,222
and I could really use
your vote.

310
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,557
Uh, who's president now?

311
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:13,825
Uh, Sheldon Cooper.

312
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,193
You know, about yay tall

313
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:17,028
and about yay annoying.

314
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,364
So you want me to vote
against Sheldon Cooper?

315
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,933
Yeah. You just need
to show up at a meeting...

316
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,267
Oh, no, no. No can do.

317
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,636
He's got a restraining order
against me.

318
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:27,371
Really? Why?

319
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,973
Uh, I locked him
on the roof once.

320
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,109
(whispers):
Three times.

321
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,111
So, Mrs. Petrescu,

322
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,746
we were hoping you would vote
for Leonard

323
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,048
instead of voting for Sheldon.

324
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,050
Vote Sheldon.

325
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:41,719
No, no. Vote Leonard.

326
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,121
No vote Leonard.

327
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:48,559
No. Vote Leonard.

328
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,662
Thank you.

329
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,267
She's wearing a pin
from your store.

330
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,602
Do you know who she is?

331
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,003
Oh, sure, yeah.
That's Cynthia.

332
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,138
Wha... s-so,
she's a customer?

333
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,708
Yeah, yeah, but I-I haven't
seen her in a while.

334
00:14:03,743 --> 00:14:05,276
And before you say anything,

335
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,712
there is a lot of reasons
women stop coming here.

336
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,580
It's not just me.

337
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,749
But this time...

338
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,951
It was me. Yeah.

339
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,622
I was trying out
a flirty new smile.

340
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,862
Now, I don't use the word

341
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:28,099
"ghoulish" a lot, but...

342
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:31,102
I-I just can't think
of another word.

343
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:34,572
Wait, do you know
how to find her?

344
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,208
Yeah. I think I have her
address on my mailing list.

345
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,644
Oh. Hey. Please, let me bring
the drone back to her.

346
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,379
You think you've got a shot?

347
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,514
What if she's married?
She's not.

348
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,516
It's meant to be.

349
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,584
A little tip.

350
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,721
Uh, stick with the smiles
you know.

351
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,394
Hi. What are you doing?

352
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:59,263
Leonard and Penny are trying
to turn the tenants against me,

353
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,632
so they are about to see
just what kind of power

354
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:05,536
the president of
the tenants association wields.

355
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,473
"You must be at least this tall
to use washing machine"?

356
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,177
I'm gonna hang it up
higher than Leonard.

357
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:15,947
And then his clothes
will smell.

358
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:18,816
And nobody's voting for a man
with smelly clothes.

359
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,952
No, not when there's
a perfectly unscented

360
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,286
incumbent on the ballot.

361
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,256
Sheldon, I have
an advanced degree

362
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,624
in the study of
the human brain,

363
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,093
so if my fiancé
is a raving lunatic,

364
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,095
it's kind of a ding
on my reputation.

365
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,031
If leaders
just stepped aside

366
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,267
every time they didn't have
the consent of the governed,

367
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,501
what would we have?

368
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,138
Democracy.

369
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,473
Not on my watch.

370
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,113
Okay. Don't be weird.

371
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:51,382
Don't be weird.
Don't be weird.

372
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,718
(deep voice):
Hello.

373
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,120
Hey. You found my drone.

374
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,221
(normal voice):
Yeah, yeah. Yes.

375
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,789
It took a while
to track you down,

376
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,592
but to see the look on
your face, it was worth it.

377
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,728
Aw, that's sweet.

378
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,396
Rajesh.

379
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:07,098
Cynthia.
Ah, pleasure to meet you.

380
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,933
Likewise.

381
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,736
I-I feel like I should give you
a reward or something.

382
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,571
Oh, oh, no, you don't
have to do that.

383
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:14,372
No, I insist.

384
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,973
How about your
phone number?

385
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,543
Give me your phone.

386
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,217
Thanks. So, I'll-I'll
call you, Cynthia.

387
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:28,119
Great, Rajesh.
(both chuckle)

388
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,820
And thanks again.

389
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,189
Uh, sure.

390
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:35,626
(phone rings)

391
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,795
Just checking.

392
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,033
(knocking, door opens)

393
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:43,634
Hey, Sheldon.

394
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,938
We found something
pretty interesting.

395
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,442
Huh. Well, that is surprising.

396
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:55,279
I, for one, have no idea
what they're talking about.

397
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,982
Turns out, when Amy took over
Penny's apartment,

398
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,584
she was put on the lease,
not you.

399
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,319
PENNY: Yeah, and when I
moved across the hall,

400
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,555
you got taken off the
lease and I got added.

401
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,657
Well, what are you saying?

402
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,726
That Sheldon's not
technically a tenant at all

403
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,829
and therefore,
has no standing to be president

404
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,033
of the tenants association
no matter who votes for him?

405
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,701
I don't know
how you found that out,

406
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:20,171
but I am guessing
all on your own.

407
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,606
So, looks like
we need to figure out

408
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,208
who the new president
should be.

409
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,876
I nominate myself.
I second it.

410
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,745
Huh.

411
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,915
Well, as a woman in love,
I want to stand by my man.

412
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,318
Too bad that's been rendered
bureaucratically impossible.

413
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,856
Well, this is hard for me

414
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,492
because I do love
a legal technicality

415
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,893
and this is a good one.

416
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:46,864
Although, not quite as good as
the provision in California law,

417
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,633
which states a person
who occupies a dwelling

418
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:54,105
for 30 consecutive days becomes
a tenant at will and as such...

419
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,707
I vote for Leonard!
You...

420
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:57,975
What?

421
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,810
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

422
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,947
With minimal power comes
minimal responsibility,

423
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,382
and you couldn't handle it.

424
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,253
Don't you misquote<i> Spider-Man</i>
to me.

425
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,254
It's not your fault.

426
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,456
I mean, what man
wouldn't be seduced

427
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:15,893
by the power to decide how late
the laundry room stays open?

428
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,162
Wait, you're the reason
I had to come back

429
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:19,831
and get my jeans
the next morning?

430
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,734
I can't believe you expect
me to give that up.

431
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,538
Sheldon,
it's the American way,

432
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,340
the peaceful transfer
of power.

433
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:30,875
I don't know.

434
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,676
Think about<i> Ant-Man.</i>

435
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:36,213
I'm always thinking
about<i> Ant-Man.</i>

436
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,548
Michael Douglas had the suit

437
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,218
and then he passed it on
to Paul Rudd.

438
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:44,054
Maybe you're right.

439
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,356
Really?
The<i> Ant-Man</i> thing?

440
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,424
That's what won you over?

441
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,293
Yes. He got the details right.

442
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,895
That's how you use
a superhero.

443
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,496
Mm.

444
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,466
I suppose it is time I
passed this on to Leonard.

445
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,168
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks.

446
00:18:57,203 --> 00:18:59,103
I-I know that's hard for you.

447
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,504
Well, it was.

448
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,039
But you know what?

449
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,774
Instead of being in charge,

450
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,577
I can now be
the vocal opposition,

451
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,114
criticizing and badgering
the president at every turn.

452
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,617
I think you'll be
really good at that.

453
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,452
Me, too.

454
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,323
I think I've made
a huge mistake.

455
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,392
Me, too.

456
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,199
Can't believe you
got her number.

457
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,867
I know, right?

458
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,403
How amazing would it be
if this worked out

459
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,004
and the story
of how I met my wife

460
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,908
started with you and me
in the hot tub together.

461
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:43,747
Well, do us both a favor
and start the story later.

462
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,216
Whatever.

463
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:47,084
I have a good feeling
about this girl.

464
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,552
Like, we really hit it off.

465
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,487
Stop flying it around.

466
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,089
You're gonna break it.

467
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,757
Why do you care?

468
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:57,328
Because we have to give it back
to the beautiful mystery girl.

469
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,562
Aw.

470
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,130
I mean, did you see
how hot she was?

471
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:03,234
I want to get all up on that
and start making babies!

472
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,237
I know exactly what underwear

473
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,939
I'm gonna wear
on our first date.

474
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:10,541
None!
