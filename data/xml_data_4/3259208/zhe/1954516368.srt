“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
ELlJAH: Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,637
这座城市曾经是我的家
This town was my home once.

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:08,501
我们的社区正遭受攻击
她们是在向我们宣战
Our community is under attack.
They're declaring war on us.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,610
我因你们的誓言“永远在一起”而死
I die, all because of your vow,
"always and forever."

5
00:00:11,778 --> 00:00:14,144
- 如果你是来报仇的…
- 仇我一定会报
-lf you have come here seeking revenge...
-Oh, I'll have my revenge.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,509
- 我叫杰克森
- 你就是那头一直看着我的狼
-I'm Jackson.
-You're the wolf who's been watching me.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,015
马赛尔叫女巫给我们下了咒
Marcel had us cursed by a witch.

8
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,847
- 我们得好好聊一下了
- 你是我的家人
-You and I are gonna have a chat.
-You're my family.

9
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,616
我哥哥以为我
一如过去千年般忠心于他
REBEKAH: My brother expects
My loyalty as he has for 1,000 years.

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,191
克劳斯永远不会停止控制你
Klaus will never stop
trying to control you.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,954
他这一生只真正害怕过一个人
All his life, there's only ever been
one man he has truly feared.

12
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,290
我的父亲麦可
My father, Mikael.

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,988
我们只需要一个能帮我们找到他的女巫
All we need is a witch
who can help us find him.

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,862
这就是我复仇的方式
让你看看她的背叛
That's how I'll have my revenge,
by showing you her betrayal.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,867
召唤麦可是我的主意
It was my idea to summon Mikael.

16
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,038
你们俩尽快逃走吧，越远越好
Both of you, run as far
and as fast as you can.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,145
(1919年 纽奥良）

18
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,298
这真是头一遭
Well, this is a first.

19
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,198
狼人、吸血鬼、女巫，还有腐败的警察
Werewolves, vampires,
witches and dirty cops...

20
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,236
都齐聚一堂，举杯狂欢
...all happy as clams
and drunk as stoats.

21
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,571
- 这真是个迷人的城市
- 敬禁酒时期
-You got to love this city.
-To a new era.

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,543
带来的新一轮合作
Collaboration
in the face of prohibition.

23
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:26,378
敬你们的码头、他们的私酒
还有我们用来藏酒的剧院
To your docks, their booze
and our theaters to hide it under.

24
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,521
不客气，先生们
You're welcome, boys.

25
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,030
现在我得想个更合适的方式
再私下好好谢一谢
Now, I shall have to think of a way
to thank you personally

26
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,032
你这位狼人女王
in a manner befitting
a werewolf queen.

27
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,933
我在舞池等你
Catch you on the dance floor.

28
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,267
真没想到会有今天啊
Who would have thought it possible...

29
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:51,275
我们终于统一纽奥良了
...the unification of New Orleans?

30
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,205
我们做到了，哥哥
We did it, brother.

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,111
当然了，都是我们共同努力的结果
尼克劳斯，但眼前的这一切…
Certainly, we worked together, Niklaus.
But this vision?

32
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,647
都拜你所赐
This was all you.

33
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,922
这一切都拜你所赐
This was all you.

34
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:18,727
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：恐怖戏码

35
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,770
卡蜜儿
主演：约瑟夫摩根
Camille. 

36
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,769
到这来
Please.

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,902
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯

38
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,843
你找我什么事？
Why did you call me?

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,674
你找到救我叔叔的办法了吗？
You found a way to help my uncle?

40
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,772
我尽力，但现在，我需要你的帮忙
主演：克莱儿荷特
I can try.
But first, I need your help.

41
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,814
我没时间跟你玩游戏，以利亚
I don't have time for games, Elijah.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,748
他身上的诅咒越来越严重了
主演：菲比托金
The hex on him
is getting worse by the day.

43
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,411
我弟弟胸口里正插着一把神秘的匕首
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
My brother has a mystical
torture device buried in his chest.

44
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,580
而他孩子的母亲如今也下落不明
And the mother of his child
is inexplicably missing.

45
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,123
所以我向你保证
主演：莉雅派普斯
So, I can assure you,

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,651
我也没时间跟你玩什么游戏
主演：莉雅派普斯
I have no time
to play any games, either.

47
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,254
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔

48
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,595
你要我做什么？
What do you need me to do?

49
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:50,224
女巫给我的匕首正插在他体内吗？
The dagger the witch gave me
is inside of him?

50
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,737
那东西停留在他体内多一秒
他就多痛苦一分
And every second it remains
causes Niklaus untold suffering.

51
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,933
- 这是谁干的？
- 是我
-Who stabbed him?
-I did.

52
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:02,376
现在我准备把它取出来
你最好站远一点
And now I intend to remove it.
You might wanna take a step back.

53
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,110
为什么要我来这？
Why am I here?

54
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,720
因为所有能来的人当中
Because of all the people
that could be here.

55
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:11,982
你可能是唯一一个
他不会立刻杀掉的人
You're probably the only one
he wouldn't immediately slaughter.

56
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,731
还有，每当他提到你时
他的语气里…
Also, he speaks of you with...

57
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,873
总带着罕有的尊敬
what is a rare degree,
for him at least, of respect.

58
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,202
我想大概是你让他重新认识了自己
You see, you challenge him
to see himself

59
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,834
和周遭的人
and others in a new light!

60
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,319
很快我的这项技能就会派上用场
A wonderful skill that I shall be
counting on very shortly.

61
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:46,322
要知道，在完全恢复之前
尼克劳斯会很虚弱
You see, Niklaus will be weak
as he recovers.

62
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,727
所以照顾好他，必要时喂他你的血
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
So watch over him
and feed him if you would.

63
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,025
但别太急，用手腕就好
But slowly, please,
and from your wrist.

64
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,259
你们不是存了很多血袋吗？
Don't you guys have bags of blood
in storage?

65
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,961
没错，但你的血里有马鞭草
制片：兰斯安德森
We do, but your blood is laced
with vervain.

66
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,563
这会灼伤他，能让他喝得慢点
So it will burn him.
He'll ingest it slower.

67
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,065
或许你可以好好利用这段时间
Perhaps, you could use the time
constructively,

68
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,871
说服他不要杀了自己的妹妹
persuade him
not to murder his baby sister.

69
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,782
尼克劳斯
Niklaus.

70
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,749
我无意让你如此痛苦
It was not my desire
to bring you pain,

71
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,357
但我不会眼睁睁看着你伤害蕾贝卡
but I will not see you hurt Rebekah.

72
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:22,051
我担心莎宾
正在谋划对我们的最后一击
Now, I fear Sabine may be making
a final move against us.

73
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,220
我要找到她并结束这一切
I intend to find her and to end this.

74
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,423
以利亚
(WEAKLY): Elijah...

75
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:38,272
你会为此付出代价的
You will pay for this.

76
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,949
这算什么，报复吗？
制片：邦妮怀斯
So, what's this, payback?

77
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,054
听着，我很抱歉骗了你们
我的目标不是你们
Look, I'm sorry I tricked you.
I wasn't after you.

78
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,814
这么说，我们只是附带伤害了？
What?
We were just collateral damage?

79
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,323
你差点让她和杰克森
在那场种植园大火中丧命
You almost burned her and Jackson
alive in that plantation fire.

80
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:58,259
小心点，莎宾
Careful, Sabine!

81
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,127
还是莎莉丝特，你爱叫什么都行
Or Celeste, or whatever
you like to call yourself.

82
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,498
你突然的举动会让我不安
有想杀人的冲动
Sudden moves make me jumpy,
and homicidal.

83
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,266
- 怎么，你要杀了我吗，亲爱的？
- 不，我有更好的主意
-What, you're gonna kill me, honey?
-No, I know better.

84
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,341
我知道关于你的一切
See, I know all about you.

85
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,911
我知道你喜欢自我了断
然后再附身到另一副身体上
I know that you like to off yourself
and jump into other people's bodies.

86
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,945
这次你休想这么做
Well, that's not gonna happen here.

87
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:17,605
我知道我杀不了你
I know I can't kill you.

88
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,776
但你要想对我下咒
我这位朋友伊芙会给你膝盖来一枪
But try hexing me, and my friend,
Eve, here will kneecap you.

89
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,786
你对她出手，我就会让你非常痛苦
Go for her, and then,
well, I'll really make it hurt.

90
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,750
你究竟想怎么样？
So, what do you want?

91
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:27,915
90年代时
In the '90s, 

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,858
你占有了一个女巫的身体
编剧：戴克兰迪巴拉，黛安艾德穆强
you inhabited a witch

93
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,362
她叫布琳德弗罗
编剧：戴克兰迪巴拉，黛安艾德穆强
named Brynne Deveraux,

94
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:31,792
还记得吗？
 remember?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,525
马赛尔要她，也就是你
Marcel had her, you,

96
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,534
对一群狼人施咒
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
put a curse on a lot of werewolves

97
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:39,697
使他们只能在月圆之夜
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
so they'd only turn human

98
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,501
才能变身为人
on a full moon.

99
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,164
我懂了
I see.

100
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,211
就是我干的
你想报仇是吗？
Yes, that was me.
And let me guess. You want revenge.

101
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,814
我要你解除诅咒
I want you to undo the curse.

102
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,975
我从没想过我会做这样的事
Things I never thought I'd be doing:

103
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,848
给一个吸血鬼喂血
feeding a vampire.

104
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,048
16岁的我一定会觉得这事酷毙了
My 16-year-old self would think
I'm really cool right now.

105
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,689
慢点好吗？
(CRUNCHES)
Ah, slow down.

106
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,061
你喝到马鞭草不会难受吗？
Doesn't the vervain burn?

107
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,205
你现在应该懂了，卡蜜
As you may have yet to realize,
Cami,

108
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:20,403
带给我们痛苦的东西
和给我们能量的东西
the line between what brings us pain
and what sustains us

109
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,879
界限并不是很鲜明
is far thinner than one imagines.

110
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,142
你是在说我的血
Are we talking about my blood

111
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:27,218
还是在说你内心
追杀最爱之人的需求？
or your need to hunt down
the people you love most?

112
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,413
我现在很虚弱，听不了你的说教
I'm too weak
for one of your talks right now.

113
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,255
她是你妹妹，你怎么会恨她？
She's your sister.
How can you hate her?

114
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,091
因为她对我做了一件
Because she has done

115
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,201
一千年来没有人能做到的事
what no one else has managed
to do to me for a thousand years.

116
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,565
伤透我的心
Rip my heart out.

117
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,443
看看那两个人
Look at these two,

118
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:57,174
明明是情侣
还假装不在一起
pretending to be apart
while so clearly a pair.

119
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,549
尼克劳斯，别这样
你干嘛非得找麻烦？
Niklaus, not now.
Why must you cause trouble?

120
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,656
我想借这个机会
I'd like to take this opportunity

121
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,925
让大家关注一下这两个人
to draw attention to two people...

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,402
他们一直背着我偷偷摸摸在一起
...who have been sneaking around
behind my back together.

123
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,841
我们进入了新的时代
As we move into a new era,

124
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:33,975
所以需要更先进的态度
we require more progressive
attitudes to match.

125
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,586
这一杯…
So....

126
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,750
敬我亲爱的妹妹
To my loving sister

127
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:43,385
以及我的左右手
亦是我的挚友，马赛尔
and my right-hand man
and best friend, Marcel.

128
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,561
愿他们获得幸福
May they find joy in each other.

129
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,496
说够了，音乐继续
Enough talk. Music!

130
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,506
这么多年来
Over the years,

131
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,313
我阻档你的情路
只是为了保护你
I've thwarted your loves
simply to protect you.

132
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,791
我知道如果我们再次逃亡
你一定会为爱而心碎
I knew if we had to run again,
your heart would be broken.

133
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,985
但我们不用再逃亡了
But we don't have to run anymore.

134
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:20,856
我们找到了家
We've found a home.

135
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:31,137
祝你幸福，妹妹
Be happy, my sister.

136
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,019
我放下了戒心
I'd let my guard down

137
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:46,056
开始享受幸福
我太愚蠢了
and given in to happiness.
More fool, l.

138
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:49,092
后来我发现，他们早就背叛了我
Turns out,
they'd already betrayed me...

139
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:58,031
把我躲避了几世纪的人带来了这里
...and brought to town the one thing
I'd been running from for centuries.

140
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,733
我的父亲
My father.

141
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,140
没错
Yes...
(lNHALES SHARPLY) "Oh."

142
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,179
所以你一直执着于无法完成的复仇
So you're consumed by revenge
you'll never achieve.

143
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,551
以利亚暗示说蕾贝卡和马赛尔
现在可能在任何地方
Elijah implied Rebekah and Marcel
could be anywhere in the world.

144
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:22,023
这可不一定哦
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

145
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:33,462
你能相信我们居然公开地
Can you believe we're sitting
out here in the open?

146
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,834
- 毫无顾忌地坐在这里吗？
- 不能
-Bold as brass?
-No.

147
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,704
感觉就像在天堂
It feels like heaven.

148
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,076
洁妮薇召唤我父亲
You know, it's been over six months

149
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,943
已经有六个多月了，什么事也没有
since Genevieve summoned my father,
and nothing.

150
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,549
她的咒语一定是失灵了
Her spell must have failed.

151
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,915
如果真是这样，我们就躲过一劫了
Hey, if so, we dodged a bullet.

152
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,522
好了
Right.

153
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:57,857
我要去妇女禁酒协会会议上发表演讲
I am off to speak at the
Women's Temperance Society meeting

154
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,227
让这座城市的妻子们
督促她们的丈夫戒酒
to make sure the wives of this city
urge their husbands not to drink.

155
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,459
你们现在不都在做酒类生意吗？
Aren't you all in the booze biz now?

156
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,228
没错
Yes.

157
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,736
但人总是这样，越被禁止
But the more one tells you
you can't have something,

158
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,638
就越渴望
而且不惜代价
the more you crave it...
at all costs.

159
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:32,997
他会追杀我们到天涯海角
He'll chase us
to the ends of the earth.

160
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,962
他一定会找到我们
And he'll find us.

161
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,999
没有人能躲一辈子
No one can hide forever.

162
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,798
尤其是躲避一个愤怒的米卡森家的人
Especially not
from an angry Mikaelson.

163
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,600
那我们就继续坚持计划
Then we go through with the plan.

164
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,076
要想永远躲开克劳斯的追杀
只有一个办法
There's only one way we'll truly
be able to hide from Klaus forever.

165
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,647
他们会需要隐身咒
They'll need a cloaking spell.

166
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,841
而这个咒语需要女巫来完成
And for that, they'll need a witch.

167
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,250
黛维娜是唯一的机会
如果我们回去找她…
Davina is our one shot.
If we go back and get her--

168
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,356
- 这样是送死
- 只有这个办法
-It's a suicide mission.
-It's our only hope.

169
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:01,254
我们让她复活，带她离开，远走高飞
We resurrect her, take her with us,
and get out of town.

170
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,486
她会帮我们躲开克劳斯的追踪
他就找不到我们了
Then she can hide us from Klaus
so he'll never find us.

171
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,824
我们甚至不知道要杀哪个女巫
才能让她复活
We don't even know the right witch
to bring her back.

172
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,124
那就全杀了
Then we'll kill them all.

173
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,668
不过就是杀三个连克劳斯米卡森
都能打倒的女巫，没什么大不了
Just kill the three witches
that brought
the mighty Klaus Mikaelson to his knees.
No big deal.

174
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,237
听我说，如果你不想一辈子提心吊胆
Unless you want to spend eternity
looking over your shoulder,

175
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,204
我们只有一个办法
there's only one thing
that we can do.

176
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,936
他们只有一个地方可去
There's only one place they can go.

177
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,948
家
Home.

178
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:44,393
一旦秩序恢复
你们族类就不能来这里了
When order is restored,
your kind won't be allowed in here.

179
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,038
幸好时候还没到
Well, fortunately,
that day has not yet come.

180
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,468
我要找到莎宾
I need to find Sabine.

181
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:52,771
她带走了一个对我很重要的人
I believe she's taken someone
very important to me.

182
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,345
你觉得我会帮你吗？
(SCOFFS)
And you thought I'd help you?

183
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,141
莎宾是我们的人
Sabine is one of us,

184
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,715
一心想让女巫势力崛起
committed to the rise
of the witches.

185
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,081
莎宾只一心想毁灭我的家族
The only thing Sabine is committed
to is the destruction of my family.

186
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,279
这有什么不好吗？
And that would be a bad thing, why?

187
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,981
和你母亲一样
Like your mother,

188
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:08,626
我母亲也是女巫
法力无边的女巫
my mother was also a witch,
a very powerful witch.

189
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,386
事实上，正因为有我的家族
In fact, because of my family,

190
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,498
她的法力才会在你们的血液里流淌
her power now flows
through your veins.

191
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,260
现在，只要莎宾操纵她身边的人
Now, once Sabine manipulates
those around her,

192
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,902
她就会采用她一贯的手法
she will do
what she has always done.

193
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,732
附到别人身上然后就此消失
She will jump into another body
and disappear.

194
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,704
让你们女巫法力尽失
Leaving your witches powerless.

195
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:27,642
不会，她和我们有一样的信念
她要助我们恢复法力
No, she has the faith.
She will see our power restored.

196
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,838
有个办法能保障这一切
There's a way of guaranteeing this

197
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,712
我也会保障你和你族人的安全
while also securing the safety
of yourself and your kind.

198
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:37,219
来，这是我母亲的魔法书里的
Here.
This is from my mother's grimoire.

199
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,755
莎莉丝特用了一个类似的咒语
以完成附身
Celeste used a similar spell
to body jump.

200
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,857
如果莎宾所言属实
当她牺牲自己时
If what Sabine says is true,
when she sacrifices herself,

201
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,259
她的法力就会释放回大地
all of her power
will flow back into the earth.

202
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:51,699
不过，如果她说谎
并试图占用另一副身体
However, if she has lied
and tries to take another body...

203
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,364
这个咒语就会帮她达成另一种效果
...this spell will deliver her
to a very different destination.

204
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:02,309
现在就请找到莎宾
Now please... Iocate Sabine.

205
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:05,906
图德巫父死了
REBEKAH:
Papa Tunde is dead.

206
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,246
现在就剩莎宾、贝丝蒂娜和洁妮薇
That leaves Sabine, Bastianna
and Genevieve.

207
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,409
我们要把她们全杀了
We want to kill them all.

208
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,250
等黛维娜一复活，我们就带她离开
And as soon as Davina rises,
we take her with us.

209
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,085
听着，我们只有一次机会
Look, we have one shot at this.

210
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,627
我知道我们成功的机会渺茫
And I know our chances of success
are sweet bugger all,

211
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,991
但我们得试试
but we've got to do it.

212
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:24,068
所以拜托了，同是丧家之犬
帮帮我们
So, please,
one stray dog to another, help us.

213
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:28,104
能逢凶化吉还能侃侃而谈
英雄事迹的人可不多
Not many go up against those odds
and live to tell the story.

214
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,666
你有过吗？
Have you?

215
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,170
我还站在这里不是吗？
I'm still standing here, aren't l?

216
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,943
最凶险的我都经历过了
I've gone up
against the worst of them all.

217
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,316
再来一杯
I'll take another.

218
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,483
你很有福气
You're a lucky man.

219
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,425
男人都在寻觅像她这样的女人
Men search the world over
for a woman like her.

220
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,157
她名花有主了，朋友
Well, she's taken, friend.

221
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,028
看得出来
Oh, I can see that.

222
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,797
只是她让我想起了我亡妻年轻时的样子
She reminds me so much
of my departed wife as a girl.

223
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:01,701
瞧我四处漂泊了这么久
See, I've been traveling
for such a long time,

224
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:06,106
却在千里之外遇见如此相似的人
真是一种恩赐啊
that it's a blessing to see
a familiar soul so far from home.

225
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,043
对您失去至亲深表遗憾
I'm sorry for your loss.

226
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,777
这是敬那些异乡的故人
Here's to old faces in new places.

227
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,825
我来纽奥良有一天了
我觉得这地方很令人惊喜
I've been in New Orleans for a day,
and I find it to be quite surprising.

228
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,986
要是我知道它和这里的人如此有魅力
Had I known of its charm
and fascinating denizens,

229
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,654
我早就来了
I would have come ages ago.

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,494
我想我该谢谢你
此番邀请
I suppose I have to thank you
for extending this invitation.

231
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,698
你是谁？
Who are you?

232
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,038
你是聪明人
Oh, you're a smart man.

233
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,736
你应该知道我是谁
I think you know.

234
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:46,985
（歌剧爱好者与资助者）

235
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,283
我也是聪明人，所以坐下吧
I'm an intelligent man myself,
so have a seat.

236
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,324
跟你说说今天下午我对你有哪些了解
Let me tell you what I learned
about you this afternoon,

237
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,325
马赛尔杰拉德
Marcel Gerard.

238
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,556
你苦恼受我儿子尼克劳斯的控制
You chafe under the control
of my son, Niklaus,

239
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,702
你愿不惜一切来摆脱他
and would do just about anything
to get rid of him.

240
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,999
甚至是召唤这世上比你还要恨他的人
Even call the one man on this earth
who hates him more than you do.

241
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,073
但我不明白你想得到什么
But I couldn't understand
what you hoped to gain.

242
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,937
这座城市的统治权吗？
Rule of this city?

243
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,410
如我所说，纽奥良确实有它的魅力
Well, as I said,
New Orleans has its charms.

244
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,414
但是把我召唤来
But to call me?

245
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,779
我可是他们眼中的毁灭者
The one they call "The Destroyer."

246
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,550
我曾把比这更有魅力的城市
The one who's burnt cities
far more charming

247
00:15:24,723 --> 00:15:27,123
夷为平地，只为找到他的孩子
to the ground
in pursuit of his children.

248
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:29,124
但现在我明白了
But now I see.

249
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,857
你这么做是为了爱情，我女儿的爱
You did it for love,
the love of my daughter.

250
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,433
不准你碰她
Don't you dare touch her.

251
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,366
所以我打算给你一个承诺
So, I'm going to make you a promise.

252
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,527
我不会伤害蕾贝卡
I won't hurt Rebekah.

253
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,106
说实话，她一直是我的最爱
Truth be told,
she was always my favorite.

254
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,937
而这座城市，你可以拿去
And this city?
You can have it.

255
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,476
但首先你必须告诉我
我的儿子在哪里
But first, you must tell me
where to find my sons.

256
00:15:55,387 --> 00:16:00,791
- 你还很虚弱
- 我还是很饿
-You're still weak.
-I'm still hungry.

257
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,555
厨房里有新鲜的血
There's a fresh blood supply
in the kitchen.

258
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,757
你撑不到那里去的
You won't make it that far.

259
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,993
所以你就乖乖地躺回床上去吧
So be a good little boy
and get back into bed.

260
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,799
如果每次有女人对我说这句话
我都能得到一英镑…
If I had a quid for every time
a woman has tried that line on me...

261
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,137
- 那你就是穷光蛋
- 恕我不敢苟同
-You'd have, like, no money.
-I beg to differ.

262
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:22,178
还是有女人觉得我很有魅力的
Some women actually find me
quite charming.

263
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,318
与敌人上床呢
Sleeping with the enemy, I see.

264
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,485
- 我现在是盟友了，亲爱的
- 确实如此
-I'm the ally now, darling.
-Well, indeed.

265
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:42,225
我们的宿敌为了示好
And as a gesture of goodwill
from our old enemy,

266
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,268
送了今晚歌剧“清教徒”的票
tickets to tonight's opera,
Les Huguenots.

267
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:47,302
他们有一个非常出色的女高音
They have a soprano to die for.

268
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,169
如果你们保证不吃了她
我就介绍你们认识
I'll introduce you
if you promise not to eat her.

269
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,005
拉娜
出色的女高音绝不会变成晚餐的
Oh, Lana,
a good soprano is never dinner.

270
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,444
叫蕾贝卡带马赛尔来
Tell Rebekah to bring Marcel.

271
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:01,609
现在就可以告诉她，哥哥
Feel free to tell her now,
big brother.

272
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,881
我还有事情要和我们的新盟友讨论呢
I have some business
I need to discuss with our new ally.

273
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,123
我怎么一点都不惊讶你喜欢歌剧？
Why am I not surprised
you like opera?

274
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,966
我总是特别容易为“清教徒”动容
I always had a particular soft spot
for Les Huguenots.

275
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,194
我喜欢那故事
I like the story.

276
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,363
讲述的是一段禁忌之爱
It was a tale of forbidden love.

277
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,601
类似“罗密欧与朱丽叶”
A Romeo and Juliet of sorts.

278
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,373
将要结婚的那天
On the day they are to marry,

279
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,073
家人和长久以来的仇恨阻止了他们
family and long-festering hatred intervene.

280
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,878
数千人遭屠杀
Thousands are massacred.

281
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:39,650
在最后一慕，一位父亲
甚至杀死了亲生骨肉
A father even kills his own child
in the final act.

282
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:43,553
我几乎能体会到其中的讽刺了
I can almost appreciate the irony.

283
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,999
来
Here.

284
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:56,505
这是研磨成糊状的草药
能够作为咒语的传导物
It's herbs ground into paste,
it'll act as a conduit for the spell.

285
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:58,768
下一次月圆，你的族人变成人类时
On the next full moon,
when your people become human,

286
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,208
给他们吃下，诅咒便会解除
feed it to them,
the curse will be broken.

287
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,439
这倒是一次毒死所有人的好方法
Great way to poison us all at once.

288
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:06,413
听着，我知道你没理由相信我
Look, I know you have no reason
to trust me.

289
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,952
但是，海莉，我真的很喜欢你
But, Hayley, I actually like you.

290
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,521
我曾像你一样
I was you.

291
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,124
关心以利亚
而他却更在乎他弟弟
Caring for Elijah
when he cared more for his brother.

292
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,385
我的下场就是死掉
And I ended up dead.

293
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,461
还有很多人也是
So did a lot of others.

294
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:21,690
这是一次机会，让我能够给你
因我爱得太深而无法给自己的机会
This... call it a chance
for me to give you
what I was too in love
to give myself.

295
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,301
是一次能够让你摆脱真祖的机会
It's a chance to free yourself
from the Originals.

296
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,062
你相信她吗？
You believe her?

297
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,933
不管她承诺你什么，都是骗你的
Whatever she's promised you,
it's a lie.

298
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,807
以利亚，没事，我没事
Elijah, it's okay. I'm okay.

299
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:35,446
不能相信她
She cannot be trusted.

300
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,582
她是唯一能够帮助我们族群的人
She's the only one
that can help my pack.

301
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,944
你知道她对我的家人做了什么吗？
Do you have any idea
what she has done to our family?

302
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,518
我知道你想复仇
I know you want revenge,

303
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,121
下次月圆再来吧
等我确认了她的解药有效
and come the next full moon,
when I'm sure her cure works,

304
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,278
她就归你了
she's all yours.

305
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,119
你是说我们要关着她？
Are you suggesting
that we hold her...

306
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:55,359
把她关一整个月吗？
那会需要一整支部队
Her, captive for an entire month?
-lt would take an army.

307
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,396
我有
-And I've got one.

308
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,733
要嘛帮我，要嘛不要干涉我
So help me or get out of my way.

309
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:18,079
- 你骗她
- 没有
-You tricked her.
-It's no trick.

310
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,420
你手里拿着的就是治愈海莉族人的解药
You're holding the cure
for Hayley's clan in your hand.

311
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,528
如果她的狼人们服下它，诅咒就会解除
他们就自由了
If her wolves take that elixir,
the curse is no more. They're free.

312
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,721
你让她的族人承受了数十年的痛苦
You condemned her people
to decades of agony,

313
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,527
而现在你却心甘情愿解除诅咒
and now you just break the curse
without so much as a whimper.

314
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,862
为什么？
Why?

315
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,267
因为这是我能为她做的最好的事了
Because it's the best thing
I could do for her.

316
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,208
也可能是我能对你做的最糟的事
And it's the worst possible thing
I could do to you.

317
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,269
你在说什么？
What are you saying?

318
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,640
不论现在发生什么
你都已经失去她了
That no matter what happens now,
you've lost her.

319
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,907
你毁了那个罐子，杀了我
You destroy that jar, you kill me,

320
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:47,677
海莉会恨你
将她的家人从她身边夺走
Hayley will hate you
for snatching her family from her.

321
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,017
现在，如果你把罐子给她
Now, if you give her the jar,

322
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,784
我们都知道她最终也会离开你
和他们在一起
we both know that she'll leave you
in the end to be with them.

323
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,553
而我知道，只要她能过着
And I know
that as long as she's alive,

324
00:19:56,728 --> 00:20:00,186
你无法想像的开心幸福的生活
and happy and fulfilled in ways
that you can't even imagine...

325
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,991
那我就复仇成功了
...then I get my revenge.

326
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,500
你决定吧
So, you decide.

327
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,536
给她想要的一切然后失去她
Give her everything she ever wanted
and lose her.

328
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:12,700
或是拒绝，看看会发生什么
Or deny it,
see what happens then.

329
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:18,545
还有一个人呢？莎宾呢？
Where's the third one?

330
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,275
我要求见你们三人
Sabine, I asked to meet
with all three of you.

331
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:21,817
我们见你完全是出于礼节
Our meeting you at all is a courtesy

332
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,547
因为你曾是女巫的朋友
for your being a friend to witches
in the past.

333
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,486
但礼节也是有限度的
But courtesy has its limits.

334
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:30,754
好了，你说你有我们感兴趣的消息
Now, you said you had information
of interest to us.

335
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,089
蕾贝卡和马赛尔回来了
Rebekah and Marcel are back.

336
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,528
他们为黛维娜而来
They came for Davina,

337
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,431
他们认为如果杀死你们三个就能救活她
and they think that they can get her
if they kill all three of you.

338
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,302
听着
我可以直接带你们去找他们
Now look,
I can lead you straight to them,

339
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,374
但我要回报
but there's something
I want in return.

340
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,942
是什么呢？
And what's that?

341
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,512
你的命
Your life.

342
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,598
敢跟着我，我就把你们俩烧成灰
Follow me,
and I'll turn you both into ash.

343
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,076
- 别管了，我们晚点再解决她
- 马赛尔
-Forget her. We'll get her later.
-Marcel.

344
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,645
我们仅有的优势就是出其不意
现在已经没有了
All we have is the element of surprise,
and we have lost it.

345
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,941
如果我们现在不离开
就没人会救我们了
If we don't leave now,
there will be no one to save us.

346
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,712
我已经让黛维娜失望了一次
我不会丢下她的
I already failed Davina once.
I'm not leaving her behind.

347
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,556
我不觉得这会有帮助
Not sure that helps.

348
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,930
那可不一定
Not sure it doesn't.

349
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,391
你想要自我治愈自怨自艾，没问题
You want to self-medicate
your self-pity, fine.

350
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,128
不管以利亚怎么说
喝威士忌总比喝我的血强
Better Scotch than my blood,
no matter what Elijah says.

351
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,398
别跟我提以利亚
Don't speak to me of Elijah.

352
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,337
- 他爱你
- 是的
-He loves you.
-Yes.

353
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,138
他是爱我，也屦次证明了这点
He does. and he proves it
time and again.

354
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,305
即使是在我父亲要求他杀了我时
Even when my father
enlisted him to kill me.

355
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,815
“清教徒”
Les Huguenots.

356
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:06,151
在威尼斯时看过，了不起的作品
Saw it in Venice,
marvelous production.

357
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,422
- 是你
- 没事，儿子
-You.
-It's all right, son.

358
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:11,084
我只是想聊聊
I just want to talk.

359
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:14,255
你无情地追杀了我们好几个世纪
You mercilessly hunt us for centuries.

360
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:19,427
毁掉了半个欧洲
现在你只是单纯想要聊聊？
You laid waste to half of Europe,
now you...
You simply wish to talk?

361
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,504
我追杀的是你那个杂种弟弟
It was your bastard brother I hunted.

362
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,301
不是你，从来都不是你
Not you, never you.

363
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,207
你是我的骨肉
是我能骄傲称之为儿子的骨肉
You're my blood,
one that I'd be proud to call son.

364
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,712
我来是为了给你一个机会
So, I came here to give you a chance

365
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:33,783
帮我永久解决掉那个畜生
to help me put down
that whelp for good.

366
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,127
你真的不了解我吗？
Do you really not know me?

367
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:49,224
你觉得我可以或者我会
相信你说的任何话吗？
You think I could or would believe
in anything that you say?

368
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:57,540
如果你真以为我会为了你背叛我弟弟
If you honestly believe
I would betray my own brother for you,

369
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,405
那你真是太蠢了
you're a fool without equal.

370
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,208
我原谅你，对你称之为弟弟的那东西
I'll forgive you
your sentimental affections

371
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,180
感情用事
for the thing you call brother.

372
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,320
但你要知道
But you need to realize, as I did,

373
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:13,254
在我得知他母亲
和一个畜生睡了之后生出了他
when I learned his mother
had lain with a beast to beget him...

374
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,991
尼克劳斯就是个令人厌恶的东西
...Niklaus is an abomination.

375
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:21,223
你不能和令人厌恶的东西说话
You do not talk to abominations.

376
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,337
不能和他们讲理
或是试图改变他们
You do not reason with them,
or try to change them.

377
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,838
只能除掉他们
You erase them!

378
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:35,844
是的，我要求你帮我杀死你弟弟
So, yes, I am asking you
to help me kill your brother.

379
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,479
你一直说杀死
You keep saying kill, 

380
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,381
但你是永生的，你不能被杀死
but you're immortal.
You can't be killed.

381
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,454
可以的，亲爱的
Oh, but we can, love.

382
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,251
而我父亲就是唯一
有办法杀死我们的人
And my father was the only one
with the means to do it.

383
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,090
一根白橡树木桩
A white oak stake,

384
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,524
出自我父亲之手
fashioned by my father

385
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,757
要从我们这里夺走
他强加于我们身上的东西
to take from us the very thing
he forced upon us all:

386
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,629
永生
our immortality.

387
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:08,405
与我为盟
或者和他一起死
Stand with me or fall with him.

388
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,911
做选择吧，儿子
Choose, son.

389
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,159
我永远都会…
选择他
I will always choose him!

390
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,795
好吧
Fine.

391
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:33,429
以利亚始终心怀愧疚
Elijah has always carried guilt
for that night

392
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,129
那晚没能阻止我们的父亲
for not stopping our father.

393
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,105
我跟他说不要自责
I told him not to blame himself.

394
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,439
当父亲想要杀死你
他就是真的想这么做
When your father wants to kill you,
he wants to kill you.

395
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,510
你也不能做什么
Nothing you can do about it.

396
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:52,656
我不想做一个无所不知的人
Oh, I hate to be a know-it-all,

397
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,759
我妹妹和她的爱人在城里出现了
but my sister and her lover
have been spotted in town.

398
00:24:55,927 --> 00:24:58,760
恐怕故事只能讲到这里了
So, story time endeth here,
I'm afraid.

399
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,097
那是什么？
What is that?

400
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,431
白橡树木桩
A white oak stake.

401
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:09,437
我的特殊版本
My own special version.

402
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:14,636
和我父亲的不同
这一根无法被摧毁
And unlike my father's,
this one cannot be destroyed.

403
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:26,582
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

404
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:28,956
如果你非得问的话
If you have to ask,

405
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,822
就说明显然你都没专心听
you obviously
haven't been paying attention.

406
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,294
我要去杀我妹妹
I'm going to kill my sister.

407
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:36,332
但首先，我得吃些
马鞭草含量低的食物
But first, I needed some sustenance
with a little less vervain in it.

408
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,695
请勿见怪
No offense.

409
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,962
当黛维娜给我看了你对我所做的一切
When Davina showed me
all you did to me,

410
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,663
你从我这里夺走的一切时
我想杀了你
all you took from me,
I wanted to kill you.

411
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,173
我甚至想过把那把刀刺进你的身体
就像女巫们要求我做的那样
I even thought about burying
that blade in you,

412
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,868
但我没有
我停下来思考，我权衡了
Iike the witches asked me to,
but I didn't.

413
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,536
在你身上所看到的优点
I stopped. I thought.
I weighed the good I see in you

414
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,909
和我知道的你所做的可怕的事
versus the horrible things
I know you've done,

415
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:55,484
我意识到如果我伤害了你
我会满怀痛苦的悔恨
and I realized if I hurt you,
I'd be filled with a terrible regret.

416
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,418
你也会如此，如果你伤害你妹妹的话
她可是你妹妹，克劳斯
You will, too, if you hurt
your sister, your sister, Klaus!

417
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,082
身为一个失去手足
感受过那种痛楚的人
As a person who has lost a sibling,
who has felt that pain,

418
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,818
如果你杀了她，你会活不下去的
you won't survive
if you're the one who kills her.

419
00:26:03,995 --> 00:26:06,463
我告诉你什么让我
差点活不下去吧，亲爱的
I'll tell you
what I almost didn't survive, love.

420
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,757
我妹妹
My sister,
bringing the most vile creature

421
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,863
把这地球上最邪恶的生物招来了
ever to have walked the earth
down upon me.

422
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,163
是的，你父亲
Yes, your father.

423
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,499
但追杀蕾贝卡和马赛尔到天涯海角
But by hunting Rebekah and Marcel
down to the ends of the earth,

424
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:18,336
用你曾经经历的恐怖来威吓他们
by terrorizing them the way you
yourself were terrorized...

425
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,336
不要变成你父亲
Don't become your father.

426
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,612
我已经被认为是不折不扣的恶魔
I've been called
every shade of monster,

427
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,946
但这倒是第一次
我父亲？
but that's new.
My father?

428
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:32,089
麦可是连恶魔都害怕的魔鬼
Mikael was the monster
monsters were afraid of.

429
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,918
来，我带你看看
Come. Let me show you.

430
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,893
- 你回来了
- 我一直都会回来的
-You came back.
-I always come back.

431
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:48,304
拿着吧
Take it.

432
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,534
会有用的
It will work.

433
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,050
我和伊芙会尽量召集族人
Eve and I will round up
as many of our people as we can.

434
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,662
等月圆时，我终于能解救我的家人了
Come full moon,
I can finally free my family.

435
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:23,766
海莉
Hayley.

436
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:40,149
不知道他们是否知道
拥有你是何其幸运的事
I wonder if they have any idea
how lucky they are to have you.

437
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:03,505
真感人
多么纯洁的轻吻
That was touching.
Such a chaste, little kiss.

438
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,015
我所认识的以利亚可绝不会如此温和
The Elijah I knew was never so meek.

439
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:10,916
我所认识的莎莉丝特绝不会这么残忍
Well, the Celeste I knew
was never so cruel.

440
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,818
你想要什么？你最终的目的是什么？
What is it that you want?
What's your endgame?

441
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,221
这场游戏永远不会结束，以利亚
Oh, this game never ends, Elijah.

442
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:17,190
我们都是永生的，你知道
We're both immortal, you know.

443
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,227
如果你赢不了，那还有什么意义呢？
Then what's the point
if you can't possibly win?

444
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:21,627
但我赢了啊
But I have.

445
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,495
你刚刚失去了那女孩
You just lost the girl.

446
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,999
你无法和她更进一步
The girl you never made a move on

447
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,003
因为你太急切地想要拯救你的家人
because you were so desperate
to save your family.

448
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,641
如今你的家人毁灭了
And now your family lies in ruins.

449
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:33,209
尽管你做了那些事，我的家人
My family,
despite all that you have done,

450
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,675
还是会完好如初的
will heal in time.

451
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,677
如果你们有时间的话，也许吧
If you had the time, maybe.

452
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,011
但你真觉得蕾贝卡飞快逃离这里了吗？
But you really think Rebekah
ran far and fast from here?

453
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,312
- 我敢说她没有
- 她早走了
-I bet she didn't.
-She's long gone.

454
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,681
是吗？
Is she?

455
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,051
她和马赛尔在一起
She's with Marcel.

456
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,184
马赛尔深爱黛维娜
黛维娜死了
Now, Marcel loves Davina.
Davina is dead.

457
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,887
但她可能活过来
只要条件对了
But she could come back
under the right circumstances.

458
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,498
你敢
They wouldn't dare.

459
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,363
如果你没有这么担心海莉
你也许会早点想明白
If you hadn't been so worried
about Hayley,
you might have figured
it out sooner.

460
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,096
但你知道谁有时间想明白吗？
But you know who did have the time
to think about it?

461
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,265
你弟弟
我想知道他会做出什么
Your brother.
I wonder what he'll do.

462
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,577
来吧
Do it.

463
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:16,286
你知道这个城市的历史吧
You know your city's history.

464
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:17,819
1919年那晚
That night in 1919,

465
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,423
这里的歌剧院被烧毁了
when the opera house burnt down
on this very spot?

466
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,856
那是我父亲的杰作
That was my father at his worst.

467
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,796
这可不是个好的开始
Well, this is off to a bad start.

468
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,835
在我给予你们祝福之后
Your first big date
together in public

469
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,031
你们第一次公开的重要约会
他却放你鸽子了
after I gave you my blessing,
and he stood you up.

470
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,301
他一定有事情耽搁了
Something must have delayed him.

471
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:42,173
或者，你们的恋情公开了
Or, now that your illicit affair
is out in the open,

472
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,611
他发现整段恋情乏善可陈
he finds the whole relationship
a tad lackluster

473
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,478
就和舞女私奔去哈瓦那了
and has run off to Havana
with a showgirl.

474
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:51,054
别这么泥蛋，我去大厅找找
Don't be such a toe rag.
I'm going to check the lobby.

475
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,713
顺便去看看我们的哥哥在不在
See if you can't find our brother
while you're there.

476
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,918
就快开始了
The curtain is about to go up.

477
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:12,468
我劝你最好不要试图逃跑，孩子
I would advise against
trying to flee, boy.

478
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,737
在你试图逃跑之前
I can drive this into your heart

479
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:19,441
我就能把这个刺进你的心脏
before you can even think
of getting to your feet.

480
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:23,576
我暂时还不想让你死
And I don't want you to die, yet.

481
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,916
- 父亲
- 父亲？
-Father.
-"Father"? (CHUCKLES)

482
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,923
这么多年了你还坚持用这个词？
Still clinging to that word
after all these years?

483
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:33,223
一个渴望父亲的野种？
A bastard desperate for a daddy?

484
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,234
不知道你的亲生父亲
在我发现你不是我亲生的之前
I wonder if your real father would be
as embarrassed as I was of you

485
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:40,030
是否像我一样因你而感到丢脸
before I discovered you were not mine.

486
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,437
很有可能
Most likely.

487
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:48,504
别激动，孩子
Whoa, whoa. Ah-ah.
Easy now, boy.

488
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:53,014
别担心
死亡终究会成真
Don't worry.
Death will come.

489
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,516
但在你摆脱永生的困扰之前
But we need to have a little chat

490
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,214
我们得聊一聊
before you shuffle off
your immortal coil.

491
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,723
我们要对彼此说的话早就说完了
Any words we have for each other
have been spoken long ago.

492
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,354
但你要知道
But know this.

493
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,728
我不再是那个
I am no longer the animal

494
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,369
乞求你一点点关爱的动物了
begging for scraps of your affection.

495
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:17,702
我死的时候，可以坦然恨你
I will die
knowing my hatred of you was just.

496
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,903
我会在我建立的城池中骄傲地死去
I will fall,
proud of all I have achieved here.

497
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,945
所以…
So...

498
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,108
麦可
Mikael,

499
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:31,949
如果你要杀我
那就赶紧动手吧
if you're going to kill me,
then get on with it.

500
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:36,560
恰恰相反，尼克劳斯
有些话还没说呢
Au contraire, Niklaus,
some things remain unsaid.

501
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,219
比如，你在这里的成就的确值得骄傲
For instance, you were right
to be proud of your achievement here.

502
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,958
当我走在街上，城里的上流人士
As I walked the streets,
your name was spoken of

503
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:45,068
提起你都毕恭毕敬
in reverent tones
by the city's finest.

504
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,330
在我杀了你之后
So after I kill you,

505
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,235
我会继续待在纽奥良
I will remain here in New Orleans

506
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,742
直到每一个记得你的人都死去
until every last person
who remembers you is dead.

507
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:59,407
伟大的克劳斯的功绩
再也没有人记得
The deeds of the mighty Klaus
will be remembered by no one!

508
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,116
而你，孩子
And you, boy...

509
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,853
就像从没存在过
...will simply never have existed.

510
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,261
盛大的演出
Ah. The grand show.

511
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,065
为了你，我做了一些更动
I made some alterations in your honor.

512
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,572
你会喜欢的
You'll love it.

513
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,781
那真是一出好戏
KLAUS:
And what a show it was.

514
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:42,155
麦可魅惑观众看完
Mikael had compelled the audience
to watch it all...

515
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,626
把它当做一出滑稽喜剧而鼓掌
...to applaud as if it were
the drollest of comedies...

516
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,059
然后给歌剧院留下了惊心动魄的一晚
...and then to leave celebrating
a terrific night at the opera.

517
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,997
我试图救下马赛尔
I tried to save Marcel.

518
00:32:57,942 --> 00:32:59,933
我父亲却另有打算
My father had other ideas.

519
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,137
蕾贝卡试图阻止他
Rebekah attempted to intervene.

520
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:03,975
不！
No...

521
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,789
这些年，我真的相信她是想救我
All these years, I actually believed
she was trying to save me.

522
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,357
然后大哥冲了出来
But then big brother swooped in.

523
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:25,968
帮不了马赛尔了
There's no helping Marcel.

524
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:27,798
就在我们以为一切都没用了
Just when we thought all was lost.

525
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:29,906
我们得赶紧跑了
We must run.

526
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,004
所以我逃跑了
And so I ran,

527
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,544
像我父亲认为的丧家之犬一样被打败了
beaten like the dog
my father believed me to be.

528
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,617
在我们逃命之时
他把这里烧成平地
And as we fled for our lives,
he burnt it all to the ground...

529
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:53,493
我们以为马赛尔也烧死了
...and with it, we assumed, Marcel.

530
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,860
我活下来了
但我们所建立的一切都毁了
I lived,
but all that we had built died.

531
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,529
我最后一点人性也因此而毁
As did the last shred of me
that felt human.

532
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,006
这就是那晚我父亲从我身上夺走的东西
That is what my father
took from me that night.

533
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:10,504
我向你保证，卡蜜
I assure you, Cami,

534
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:13,809
我不会恐吓我妹妹和她的爱人数个世纪
I will not terrorize my sister
and her lover for centuries.

535
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,978
我也不会羞辱、折磨，使他们丧失人性
Nor will I humiliate,
torment or dehumanize them.

536
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,748
都不会
No, none of that.

537
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:23,382
我会简单快速地了结他们
I will simply and quickly end them.

538
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,687
克劳斯，等等
Klaus, wait.

539
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:37,739
带我来这也用不着咬我吧
Now, you didn't have to bite me
to get me here.

540
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,012
我想要坐前排看好戏呢
I wanted front-row seats
to this show.

541
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,740
什么好戏？
And what show would that be?

542
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,682
你即将看到你的“永远在一起”约定
The one where you see
your "always and forever" pact

543
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:51,219
毁于一旦
come crashing down around you.

544
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:55,519
那是个神话，以利亚
我渴望的神话
It's a myth, Elijah.
A myth I died for.

545
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:01,428
你现在还活着
暂时而已
And yet here you stand alive,
for now.

546
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,861
这是威胁吗？
Is that a threat?

547
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:07,971
总会有一个美丽的
年轻的身体等着我进入
Oh, there's always another pretty,
young body for me to jump into.

548
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,436
从现在开始
From now on,

549
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,235
每一次你对一个女人有感觉时
every time you feel
a connection to a woman,

550
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,435
你都会被迫先想想这会不会是我
you'll be forced to wonder
if it's me.

551
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,977
你不会相信任何人
You'll trust no one

552
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,846
独自一人度过你的永生
and spend the rest of eternity
alone.

553
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,086
恐怕你是被困住了
I'm afraid you're trapped.

554
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,286
边界咒语
真祖可以进却不能出
Boundary spell. The Originals
can enter, but they can't leave.

555
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:37,093
- 你不会这么做吧
- 我会，我也这么做了
-You wouldn't.
-I would, and I did.

556
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:50,310
我找到你了，小黛
I got you, D.

557
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,645
我找到你了
I got you.

558
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:10,265
这是个陷阱
快走
It's a trap. Run.

559
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,699
- 带着黛维娜离开这里
- 我不会丢下你的
-Get Davina out of here.
-I'm not leaving you behind.

560
00:36:13,871 --> 00:36:16,704
- 你必须要
- 我不会离开你的
-You must.
-I will not leave you behind.

561
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:21,436
我发誓我会追上你的
快走，带黛维娜去安全的地方
I swear I will join you.
Go. Get Davina someplace safe.

562
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,842
我会的
I will.

563
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,284
别担心，这只是个月咒
下一次月亮升起时你就自由了
Don't worry. It's a lunar spell.
You'll be free by the next moonrise.

564
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:37,985
我猜
你妹妹撑不到那时候了
My guess is,
your sister won't last that long.

565
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,705
这副身体真是充满乐趣
While this body
has been a hell of a lot of fun,

566
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:54,470
我觉得该换个人玩玩了，你说呢？
I do think it's time I find someone else
to play in, don't you?

567
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:16,125
你说得对
You were right.

568
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,807
将此灵魂回到…
(CHANTlNG lN FORElGN LANGUAGE)
Return this soul...

569
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,596
你好，莎莉丝特
Hello, Celeste.

570
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:56,597
这怎么可能？
How is this possible?

571
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,368
我和莫妮克德弗罗打了个小赌
Monique Deveraux and l
had a little wager

572
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:01,738
关于你是否能够遵守承诺
regarding your ability
to keep a promise.

573
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:04,976
看来我赢了
It appears I won.

574
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,811
你一心想摧毁我
You were so consumed
with my downfall,

575
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,286
却失去了一位自己人的信任
that you lost the trust
of one of your own.

576
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:15,755
不
No...

577
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,224
亲爱的，住手
Mon cher, no.

578
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,292
凡事都有可能

579
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,991
一切还未结束

580
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,029
抱歉
Desole.

581
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,864
黛维娜，你没事了
Davina, you're okay.

582
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,601
你现在很安全
听见了吗？你很安全
You're safe now.
You hear me? You're safe.

583
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:08,301
我不会让任何人伤害你的
I won't let anyone hurt you, okay?

584
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,356
蕾贝卡！
Rebekah!

585
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,458
蕾贝卡！
Rebekah!

586
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,389
珍惜你仅剩的几口气吧
这是你最后的机会了
Cherish the breath in your lungs!
It'll be your last.

587
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:33,060
大木偶剧场的最后一幕就要开始了
The final act of Le Grand Guignol
is upon us!

588
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:38,971
我的演员呢？
跑够了，孩子们
Where are my players?
Enough running, children!

589
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,134
出来吧
Step out of the shadows,

590
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,907
我们就能结束这悲伤的故事了
so we may finish
this tale of sorrows!

591
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,051
- 他来了
- 好
-He's coming.
-Okay.

592
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:54,824
喝吧，妹妹
Drink, sister.

593
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,994
马赛尔
Marcel.

594
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:10,496
- 他死了，妹妹
- 不
-He's gone, sister.
-No!

595
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,269
你们俩得赶快离开这里
我来拖住他，尼克劳斯
Both of you must flee the city.
I'll hold him off, Niklaus.

596
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:17,903
不
我们一起对付他
No. We fight him together.

597
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,174
我们打不过他的
We cannot fight him.

598
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,409
我们只能像以前一样
欺骗他
All we can do is do what we've done.
We deceive him.

599
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,077
把他引开
我可以做到
We lead him astray.
I can do that as well as anyone.

600
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,714
你带着她离开
我会去找你们的
You take her far away from here.
I'll find you.

601
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,056
不，以利亚，不行
不行，以利亚
No, Elijah! You can't.
You can't, Elijah.

602
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,098
- 这…这是我的错
- 不
-This is just... This is my fault.
-No.

603
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,236
这是我的错，蕾贝卡
This is my fault, Rebekah.

604
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,963
真的对不起，对不起
I am so sorry. I'm sorry.

605
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,400
马赛尔…
Marcel...

606
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:52,578
我以为我们在这里找到了家
I thought we'd found a home here.

607
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,051
尼克劳斯，拜托
妹妹，来
Niklaus, please.
Sister, come.

608
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:05,820
你们得离开了，快走
You must leave. Go.

609
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,989
快走啊
Leave!

610
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,176
以利亚？
Elijah?

611
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,306
你在这做什么？
What are you doing here?

612
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,444
蕾贝卡，你现在应该在世界的另一头了
Rebekah, you should be
on the other side of the world by now.

613
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,318
你我都知道那也不够远
You and I both know
that wouldn't have been far enough.

614
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,455
离她远点！
Get away from her!

615
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:43,925
她是我的
She's mine.

616
