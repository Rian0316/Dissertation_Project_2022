00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,400
John, you're a toy.
You and me -- no future.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,900
Once some things are said...

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,300
Remember what it was like
To work a 60-hour week?

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,000
You can't take them back.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,000
You are never going
To get somebody who cares

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,800
As much about finding dierdre
As i do.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,200
You shot yourself?

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,500
Pretty lame, huh?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,600
The damage is already done.
Mom!

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,200
You're not taking her
Away from me.

11
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:21,900
Get out.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
Lynette: i needed you
To see something.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,100
They said they stole it
>From mike's garage.

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,200
Is that blood?

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,200
Mary alice: bree van de kamp
Believed

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,500
In old-fashioned values.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,600
Things like respect for god...

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,100
The importance of family...

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,100
And love of country.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,100
In fact, bree believed
So strongly in her values,

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,300
It was always a shock
Whenever she was confronted

22
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
With those who didn't.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,200
It's not mine.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,300
You promised
The cheating had stopped, rex.

25
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:02,900
You promised.

26
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,600
Could we not yell
At each other?

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,500
I'm feeling
Really lousy today.

28
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,200
I want you
Out of the house!

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,500
Bree, look at me.

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,100
It's not mine.

31
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
Well, then,
Whose is it?

32
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,200
It just didn't magically
Appear in my laundry basket.

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Well, i'm not the only guy
In this house

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,300
That uses that hamper.

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,200
No.

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,900
Sorry.

37
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,600
Andrew is still a child.

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
He's 16.
It's not unheard of.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Honey, you have to
Talk to him.

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,600
And tell him what?

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,500
Tell him that
We found his condom,

42
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,500
And that he is forbidden
From, you know...

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,700
I can absolutely tell him
That we think he's too young,

44
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,200
But i don't think
It's going to do any good.

45
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,100
Well, then, the least we can do
Is go search his room,

46
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,500
And if we find any more
Of these, we'll confiscate them.

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,000
And that will
Accomplish what?

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,500
Well, if we take away
His condoms, maybe --

49
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,200
He's a teenage boy.
We could take away his penis,

50
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,700
He'd still try
To have sex.

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,100
Well, we can't
Put it back in his room.

52
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,900
I mean, that would be

53
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,100
Like we're condoning him
Having premarital sex.

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,300
Bree, let me
Put this another way.

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
Do you want
To become a grandmother?

56
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,100
Yes, bree believed
In old-fashioned values.

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
But she also believed...

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,400
It was better to be safe

59
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,900
Than sorry.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Mary alice: each new morning
In suburbia brings with it

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,200
A new set of lies.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,300
Little white lies,
Told not to hurt...

63
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,900
Morning, mrs. Petchel.
You lo lovely today.

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,300
But to make life
More pleasant.

65
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,600
They tell these lies
To protect themselves

66
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,800
And their reputations.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, for god's sake.
This is unbelievable.

68
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
That's the last time
I do my banking online.

69
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Of course, every now and then,
The day arrives

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,400
When someone finally decides
To tell the truth.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
He was shot?

72
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,500
How could you
Not tell us about this?

73
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,600
He was embarrassed.
He said it was an accident.

74
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,700
Oh, don't look at me like that.
Accidents happen.

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
We know
That you want to trust mike,

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,800
But he had a dead woman's
Jewelry in his garage.

77
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,200
Now, did he?
We don't know that for sure.

78
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,700

79
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,800
Is that lynette's kids
Turned up with it.

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,900
So what are you saying,
That the twins murdered martha?

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, i wouldn't
Put it past them.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm saying that
That is about as likely

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
As mike having done it.

84
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
He's a good guy.
I know him.

85
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,400
I mean, he's --
He's mike.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,100
Honestly, i don't think
Mike did it, either,

87
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,800
But if we don't call,

88
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,900
We're guilty
Of withholding evidence.

89
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,800
Well, you know what?
If he is innocent,

90
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
This should be
A simple matter to clear up.

91
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
But we will do
Whatever you want us to do.

92
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Okay, call.

93
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,300
So shall i just dial 911?

94
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,800
Well, it's not really
An emergency.
There was a murder.

95
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,500
Well, not recently, and i prefer
Not to tie up the line.

96
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,500

Any minute.

If she sees you here.

To deliver this personally.

Want us to see each other.

I'm doing this.

To my mom, okay?

Got to go.

Do i know you?

For you to show up.

Really? Why?

115
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
I want
To do you a favor.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,300
What kind of favor?

117
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,800
Well, john says that

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,700
You can't exactly afford
A gardener right now,

119
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,900
And i told him
I'd be happy to do it...

120
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,900
For free.

121
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
You want to mow my lawn
For free.

122
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,700
Mow your lawn,
Water your flowers,

124

I could do everything
John did for you.

That's very generous of you,
But i don't thk so.

Why?

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,000
Because my husband is home
Quite a lot these days.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,200
If any bush needs trimming,
He takes care of it.

You have the right
To remain silent.

Can be used against you

An attorney,

Appointed to you.

Why couldn't he have just
Passed out flyers in the quad?

Incapable of being cool?

Would this have to do with
The condom you left in my room?

As a matter of fact,
It does,

And just so we're clear,
If you get lisa pregnant,

216
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,800
You will marry her.

217

This is not funny.

Mom, trust me --
This is very funny,

220
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,600
Mostly because
The condom wasn't mine.

You suck,

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800

We need to talk.

But why on earth
Would you need a condom?

226

Because i'm planning
On having sex,

227
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,600
And i don't want
To get pregnant.

Of the abstinence club.

And you want to know why?
Because i wouldn't do it.

Well, if that's the type of boy
He is, then good riddance.

Is that type of boy.

Oh, sweetheart,

240
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,500
Just because
You give a boy sex

241
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,000
Doesn't mean
You'll get love in return.

242
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
So maybe
I'm being stupid.

352
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,300
How did you know?
I'm not clueless.

353
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,400
I found men's boxers
In the clothes hamper.

354
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,500
Oh, don't write
That down.

355
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
Oh, but this is good.
You can let mike go.

356
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,100
He's innocent.

357
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,400
Well, assuming everything
You're telling me is true.

358
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
It's true.
The next morning,

359
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,700
She made pancakes
In the shape of little hearts.

360
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
Seriously.
Little hearts.

361
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
[ gasps ]

362
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
Oh, god.

363
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,900
Justin, what are you
Doing up here?

364
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,600
Uh, i finished
The hedges.

365
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
Is there anything else
Mr. Solis wants done?

366
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,900
I don't know.
He's not here.

367
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,500
He had a meeting
With his lawyer.

368
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,900
So i guess that means
We're all alone.

369
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,800
No, that means
I'm all alone.

370
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,300
You're leavi.

371
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,900
I'm not in a hurry.

372
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,600
Come on, maybe we could
Hang out for a little while.

373
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
I don't think so.

374
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,800
Come on.

375
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,500
If you just got to know me,
You'd see i can be lots of fun.

376
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,900
All my friends say so.

377
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, i'm not interested
In becoming one of your friends.

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,600
Get out of my bedroom.

379
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
Come on, mrs. Solis,
Be nice.

380
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Aah!

381
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
You shouldn't
Have done that.

382
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Do you know
How easy it would be

383
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,300
For me to call my husband
And tell him

384
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,400
What you just tried to do?

385
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,100
Not easy as it'll be

386
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,800
For me to tell him what happened
Between you and john.

387
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,300
I-i'm sorry,
Mrs. Solis,

388
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,600
But you're going
To have to be nice to me...

389
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
At least once.

390
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,900
Mike!

391
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you okay?

392
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'm a little bit embarrassed.

393
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,100
I must be
The talk of the neighborhood.

394
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
No. Not really, no.

395
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,000
So guess what --

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,800
I'm your alibi.

397
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,600
I told the police
That we were...

398
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,700
Together the night
That mrs. Huber was killed

399
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,100
And that i could
Never forget that night.

400
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,200
So you don't think
I killed mrs. Huber.

401
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
No. No, of course not.

402
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,100
I could never think
You killed anybody,

403
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,000
Even if i wasn't
Your alibi, which i am.

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,900
Okay, i'm, um...

405
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
I'm going
To go take a shower.

406
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,100
Jail's kind of gross.

407
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
I'll call you later,
Okay?

408
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,600
Sure. When?

409
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,700
Ha ha.

410
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,800
Later.

411
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,100
All right,
I've just got some stuff

412
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,700
I got
To take care of, okay?

413
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,900
Okay.

414
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,400
Mrs. Van de kamp.

415
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,100
Hello, john.

416
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
I'm sorry to drop by
On you unannounced.

417
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,600
Do you have a moment?

418
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,700
Sure.

419
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
So...

420
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,500
What can i do for you?

421
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,100
Well, i'll tell you.

422
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
My daughter is planning
On giving you her virginity,

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,200
And i would consider it
A personal favor

424
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,800
If you wouldn't take it.

425
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,800
Hey.
Hey.

426
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,900
So what's the word
On tim?

427
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,200
He came through
The triple bypass

428
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,100
With flying colors.

429
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,800
Ah, thank god.

430
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,900
Of course,
It's not all coming up roses.

431
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,700
He's not going to be able
To come back to work for...

432
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,600
4, 4 1/2 months.

433
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,800
Oh.

434
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,700
What?

435
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
The company still needs
To expand, so i figure,

436
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,600
They need a fit,
Heart-smart guy like me

437
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,800
To step up,
Take the ball.

438
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,500
You're going after
Tim duggan's promotion?

439
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,000
No. I already got it.

440
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,500
You shld have seen me.

441
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,800
I walked straight
Into peterson's office,

442
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,300
And i told him

443
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,300
That he would be a fool
To hold duggan's promotion.

444
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,400
Ha ha.

445
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,100
You called your boss
A fool?

446
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,400
I did.

447
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,300
That was risky
In retrospect,

448
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
But you know what?
Still, he gave me the job.

449
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,800
Oh, my god!
That's great.

450
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,300
Honey, it's me.

451
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
I'm the man, i've got
The whole west coast --

452
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
Oh, my -- what?

453
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,100
What?
The whole west coast?

454
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
I thought you were going after
An in-house position.

455
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,800
No, no, no. I'm setting up
New offices from seattle to l.a.

456
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,600
I-i told you that.

457
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,600
No.

458
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,900
No, you didn't.

459
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,000
Okay.

460
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
Well, so it's going to be
A little bit more travel, but --

461
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,600
More travel?

462
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,700
Tom, you're barely here
Half the time as it is,

463
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,400
And now you're going to have,
What, twice the workload?

464
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,700
Honey, please,
Don't ruin this.

465
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm sorry, but you should have
Consulted with me.

466
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,800
I did. You told me to stop
Being a shrinking violet

467
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,200
And to step up.

468
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,800
I thought this was
An in-house position.

469
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,700
Okay, i'm going
To go shower.

470
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,600
Look, wait, wait.

471
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,400
I know what this means
To you.

472
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
No, you don't.

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,700
No, you don't.
I am 41 years old.

474
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,400
If i don't make
Vice president now,

475
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,500
It's never
Going to happen.

476
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,400
This is my career.
It's -- it's important to me.

477
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,300
So was mine,
But i'm here, aren't i?

478
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,500
I'm going to take the job.

479
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,700
She said
That you broke up with her

480
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,600
Because she refused
To have sex.

481
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,300
Wow. Um...

482
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,800
Okay, here's the deal --

483
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,100
I said that,
But it was just an excuse.

484
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,700
I mean, the truth is...

485
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
I wasn't that into her.

486
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,700
Really?

487
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,900
And she was always so proud
Of never having done it,

488
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,300
I figured, hey,
This is my way out.

489
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,600
Well, she feels
Very passionately about you.

490
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,700
Well, don't geme wrong.
She's nice.

491
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
The truth is...

492
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
There's someone else.

493
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,500
Oh.

494
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,900
Are you going steady?

495
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Not exactly.

496
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,600
We were seeing each other
Pretty regularly,

497
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,200
But this
Other lady -- girl --

498
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
She sort of dumped me.

499
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
Oh, i see.

500
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Well, look,
I'll talk to danielle,

501
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,400
And don't worry --

502
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll let her down gently.

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,600
Um, actually,
I would prefer if you didn't.

504
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,100
Huh?

505
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I know my daughter.
She's very determined,

506
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
And unless
You're really firm with her,

507
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,200
She's going to continue
To think that there's hope.

508
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,400
Okay. I'll be firm.

509
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,100
Better still...

510
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,300
Be brutal.

511
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,800
Decided to indulge
Your sweet tooth, huh?

512
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,100
I'll be dead
Inside a year.

513
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,700
I got bigger things
To worry about

514
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,000
Than my waistline.

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
So...

516
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,700
Who's the woman
They think you killed?

517
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,200
Martha huber,
Local busybody.

518
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I thought
Her murder was random.

519
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,300
Nothing random about her jewelry
Ending up in your garage.

520
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,600
Did you kill her?

521
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,300
No.

522
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,400
Whoever set me up
Did a good job, though.

523
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,200
The cops
Are all over me.

524
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,800
You're getting close
To something.

525
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,000
Well, if i am close,
I don't see it.

526
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,700
What i'm saying is
People leave trails.

527
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,400
One of those trails
Will lead to dierdre.

528
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,500
Whoever set you up
Must know that.

529
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,100
Yeah. Well, maybe.

530
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,300
But i won't be
Much good to youocked up.

531
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm rich, mike.

532
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,700
One of the best things
About being rich

533
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,600
Is the security
Of knowing

534
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,500
You can buy your way
Out of any problem.

535
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm not taking my money
To the grave.

536
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm going to use it
To save your ass.

537
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,100
Mrs. Solis.

538
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,300
Hello, justin.

539
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,100
Hey. What are you
Doing here?

540
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,500
I am here
To talk to your roommate.

541
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,900
John?

542
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,300
I-i didn't think
You guys talked anymore.

543
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,400
Well, now we have
Something to talk about --

544
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,700
You.

545
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,400
Me.

546
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,200
Yes. I'm going to tell him
How you're trying

547
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,600
To blackmail me
Into sleeping with you.

548
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,100
I wonder
How he'll react.

549
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,200
Mrs. Solis --

550
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,000
You can't talk to john
About that.

551
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,400
Oh, i can,

552
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,500
And i will, you little
Worthless piece of crap.

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Listen, mrs. Solis,
I'm sorry.

554
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm sorry. I didn't
Want to blackmail you.

555
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,400
Then why did you?

556
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,700
I really needed
To sleep with you.

557
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Why?

558
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,000
Because...

559
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,900
I think i might be gay.

560
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,400
Oh.

561
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!

562
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
Hey!

563
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
Dad!
Daddy!

564
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,100
Dad!

565
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,900
How you doing, guys?
What's up?

566
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh, we went out
For burgers,

567
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,800
And the boys knew
You wouldn't be home

568
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,000
Till after,
Um, bedtime,

569
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,500
And so we decided to pop in
And visit the new v.p.

570
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,200
Yeah, well, check it out.

571
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,600
I finally got an office
With a window.

572
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,800
Yeah, it's all about
The window.

573
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,200
Hey, guys.

574
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
Hey, who wants
Chair rides?

575
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,100
Me! !
Me!

576
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,500
Come on, out this way.
Here we go.

577
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,800
Whoo-hoo!

578
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,300
Here we go, guys.
Ready?

579
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,500
Grraah!

580
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,800
Yeah, daddy!

581
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Now hold on!
Try to hold on!

582
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,400
Ha ha.

583
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Checking out
The new executive digs?

584
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,900
Oh.

585
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
You know it.

586
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,400
Can i tell you
A little secret?

587
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,200
Sure.

588
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,700
Dan wanted to hold the promotion
Over for tim duggan.

589
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,800
And i'm the one
That convinced him

590
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,400
To givit to tom.

591
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Really?

592
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,500
Uh-huh.

593
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,700
Tom is such a workhorse,

594
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,500
And he wanted it
So badly.

595
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah, he certainly did.

596
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,300
What is wrong? Aren't you happy
About this promotion?

597
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,200
Mary alice: lynette realized
It was in her best interest

598
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,000
To lie
To the boss's wife...

599
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,400
Well, it's great,
Obviously.

600
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,000
Thank you.

601
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,200
Provided she wasn't
Too convincing.

602
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Of course,

603
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,100
I mean, i will miss him,

604
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,500
Being gone all the time.

605
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,300
He'll be bringing in
More money,

606
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,200
But he is going to miss
The birthdays,

607
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
Baseball games,

608
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,900
First steps...

609
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
But that's the trade-off.

610
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,800
Right?

611
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,400
I just hope one day,

612
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,300
Tom doesn't look back
And regret being gone so much.

613
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,500
Well, i better get out there
Before they break something.

614
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,600
Of course.
I will see you soon.

615
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,000
So have you been
Acting on these feelings?

616
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,500
I got a buddy.
We get together,

617
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,700
We mess around.

618
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,600
But it's no big deal.

619
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,700
It's just lately,
I've been starting to, like,

620
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,300
Care about him, and i don't
Know how to handle it.

621
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,000
Wow.

622
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
Yeah, and i thought if i sleep
With somebody like you,

623
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
I'll know for sure,

624
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,900
And i can stop
Freaking out about this.

625
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,200
Yeah, but why me?
You're a good-looking kid.

626
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,700
Why don't you test-drive
Someone your own age?

627
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,900
Girls talk.

628
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,800
If i start something
With somebody

629
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,300
And it doesn't...

630
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,600
Work out,

631
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Everybody at school
Will find out.

632
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
And i figured
I could trust you,

633
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,100
'Cause you have
A husband and all.

634
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Well, i guess
That makes sense, in a...

635
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,400
Weird sort of way.

636
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,100
You know, my buddy and i,
We've been messing around

637
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,600
For quite a while,
And...

638
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,600
This whole time,
I just kept telling myself

639
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,200
That it didn't really
Mean anything, you know?

640
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,800
I guess i've just been
Kidding myself, huh?

641
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,800
We're all in denial
About something.

642
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,900
But you're finally
Facing the truth,

643
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,100
And i think
That's sort of brave.

644
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,400
Thanks.

645
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,200
I should probably go.

646
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,000
Uh, just so you know,

647
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,800
I never would have told
Mr. Solis about you and john.

648
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,900
I may be gay,
But i'm not a jerk.

649
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
Did you feel anything?

650
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,300
Not really.

651
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,300
You're definitely gay.

652
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,700
[ knock on door ]

653
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,000
Hi.

654
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Hi. I'm sorry to bother you
At night, ms. Mayer,

655
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,300
But i was hoping
That maybe you could

656
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,000
Come down
To the station with me,

657
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Just answer
A few more questions.

658
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,900
Now? Well,
I-i'm sorry.

659
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,000
My -- my daughter and i were
Going to go see a movie tonight.

660
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
Mom...

661
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,400
We can do it another night.
I'll be fine.

662
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Uh...

663
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,200
Let me get my purse.
Great.

664
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Are you sure?

665
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
Yeah.

666
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,100
Well, i'm sure
I won't be late.

667
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
Okay. Bye.

668
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,100
Bye.

669
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,200
Ahem.

670
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
You said that mike
Came to your house

671
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,700
Around 10:00 p.m.
On the night of the 7th.

672
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
Um...

673
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,400
Am i supposed to talk
Into the camera or...

674
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,000
No, no. Just --
Just talk to me.

675
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,100
Okay. Uh, yes.

676
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,000
He came over
Around 10:00.

677
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,400
Do you know of any tension
Between mike and martha huber?

678
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
No.

679
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,300
Were you aware that
Mike was shot recently?

680
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,200
Yes.

681
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,800
On valentine's day.

682
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,100
And do you know
How that came about?

683
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,900
He dropped his gun
Cleaning it.

684
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,600
Ms. Mayer,
With all due respect,

685
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,300
I've been working
Around guns for yes.

686
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,300
I've never seen one discharge
When it hits the ground.

687
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,500
Someone has to
Pull the trigger.

688
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, i wouldn't know
About that.

689
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,600
Were you aware
There was a home invasion

690
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,400
Three blocks from you
On pine avenue

691
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,300
Day before valentine's?
No.

692
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,400
The intruder was shot
In the stomach.

693
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,900
Where was mike's wound?

694
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,900
The stomach.

695
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
Do you love him?

696
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,000
What?

697
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,800
What does that
Have to do with --

698
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
It's just that sometimes
People do stupid things

699
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
When they're in love.

700
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
I should know.
I've been married four times.

701
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,300
Tell me the truth.

702
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,300
He wasn't with you
That night, was he?

703
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,000
He asked you to lie for him,
Didn't he?

704
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,300
No, he didn't.
He was with me,

705
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,200
And mike wouldn't kill anybody.

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,600
Before we fall asleep.

886
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,800
We whisper them in the dark,

887
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,900
Telling ourselves...

888
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,600
We're happy.

889
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,500
Or...

890
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,700
That he's happy.

891
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:49,900
That we can change.

892
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,800
Or that he will change
His mind.

893
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:03,000
We persuade ourselves
We can live with our sins...

894
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,200
Or that we can live
Without him.

895
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,900
Yes, each night
Before we fall asleep,

896
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,100
We lie to ourselves

897
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,600
In the desperate,
Desperate hope

898
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,300
That come morning,
It will all be true.

899
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,800
