1
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:04,941
这周末你想不想
Hey, want to spend some time

2
00:00:04,941 --> 00:00:06,681
一起玩星球大战的新游戏
playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?

3
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:07,531
我说不准
Oh, I don't know.

4
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,961
我答应过自己要远离电脑
I kind of promised myself I'd get off the computer,

5
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,751
多点锻炼身体  多做些运动...
be more physically active. Get some exercise...

6
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,171
你马上要爬三层楼梯了
You're about to walk up three flights of stairs.

7
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:18,991
说得好  算我一个
Good point, I'm in.

8
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:22,331
我有个更好的主意
You know what would be great?

9
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,041
咱们像以前那样玩一把
Let's do it like the old days.

10
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,901
你是说游戏马拉松吗
You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?

11
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,721
没错  从周六早上开始
Yeah. Start Saturday morning,

12
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,081
连玩四十八个小时
go 48 hours,

13
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:31,011
带上睡袋  垃圾食品
sleeping bags, junk food...

14
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,951
关掉手机  避免老妈骚扰
Turn off our phones so our moms can't call.

15
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,191
就像几年前咱们玩魔兽世界那样
It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago

16
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,491
最后邻居都报警了
when the neighbors called the cops on us.

17
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:43,041
他们打电话报警是因为受不了恶臭
They called the cops because of the smell.

18
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:44,641
人家还以为咱们死翘翘了呢
They thought we were dead.

19
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:49,911
那时的我们真是坏小子呀
We were badass back in the day.

20
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,421
好吧  就这么定了
All right, let's do it.

21
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,511
《星球大战：旧共和国》游戏背景设定在共和国军对抗帝国军的奥德兰内战时期

22
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:55,511
星球大战  四十八小时不停战
48 hours of Star Wars gaming.

23
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,801
在电影中奥德兰星球被帝国的超级兵器死星炸成碎片

24
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,801
开战吧  就像在奥德兰战区那样
It's on like Alderaan.

25
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,741
谢尔顿  取消你周末的行程
Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend.

26
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,531
星球大战马拉松  周六上午正式开始
Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars marathon.

27
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,161
是看电影还是打电动
Movies or video games?

28
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:07,061
不  是桌游吗
No, board game?

29
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,301
还是集换式卡牌游戏
Or trading card games?

30
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,861
或是乐高  或是角色扮演
Or Lego's? Or dress up?

31
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:10,801
又或是看漫画书
Or comic books?!

32
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,711
难道是绘声绘色地朗读电影小说吗
Or dramatic readings of Novelizations?!

33
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:14,201
我都参加
Yes to all!

34
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,701
我们准备玩网游
We are going to play the online game.

35
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,371
网游
The online game?!

36
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,521
更妙
Bully!

37
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,041
先生们  虽然谢尔顿肯定非常喜欢
Gentlemen, as much as I'm sure Sheldon would enjoy

38
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,731
跟你们一起玩星际间的虚拟游戏
playing intergalactic make-believe,

39
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:27,971
但我们俩已经另有安排了
he and I have other plans.

40
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:31,091
我们要去参加弗罗拉姨妈的九十三岁生日派对
We are attending my Aunt Flora's 93rd birthday party.

41
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,511
你就跟她说我有事去不了了嘛
Just tell her I can't come.

42
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:35,921
如果我们不去  她会很失望的
She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.

43
00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:37,221
她都九十三岁了
She's 93.

44
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,481
也失望不了几年了
She won't be disappointed for very long.

45
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:43,581
不  你等会  我可是遵守了
No, hang on. I followed all the protocols

46
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,851
恋爱协议里你制定的所有规定
set forth by you in the relationship agreement.

47
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,941
我提前七十二个小时提交了书面申请
I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.

48
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,901
我检查了车的胎压
I checked the tire pressure on the car.

49
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:54,591
我甚至还联系了疾病控制中心  问他们
I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out

50
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:57,361
去橘子郡旅游要打什么疫苗
what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.

51
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,841
顺便说一声  什么疫苗都不用打
FYI, it's none.

52
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:04,601
艾米  恋爱协议制订的初衷可不是为了
Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed

53
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:06,851
给咱俩任何一方行方便
for either one of us to get our way.

54
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,741
你就拿它来给自己行方便了呀
You use it to get your way.

55
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,961
我是拿它来做该做的事
I use it to get the right way.

56
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:14,491
事实证明  该做的事就是给我自己行方便
The fact that the right way is also my way

57
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:16,241
这真是个美妙的巧合
is a happy coincidence.

58
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,501
你都答应我了
You gave me your word.

59
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,021
你就要跟我去
You're coming with me.

60
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:21,531
我们会想你的  谢尔顿
We'll miss you, Sheldon.

61
00:02:21,571 --> 00:02:22,901
好吧
Yeah, well,

62
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,401
谁会想把整个周末浪费
who wants to spend the whole weekend,

63
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,951
在一堆假想星球上跑来跑去
running around a bunch of pretend planets

64
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,491
跟不存在的怪兽打来打去呀
battling made up monsters.

65
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:29,141
小孩才这样呢
That's for babies.

66
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:31,481
话是没错  可这游戏有光剑呢
Yeah, but it's got lightsabers.

67
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:34,381
求求你了  艾米  这个游戏有光剑呢
Yeah, please, Amy! It's got lightsabers!

68
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:39,361

生活大爆炸  第五季第十九集

77
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,505
你好  斯图尔特
Hello, Stewart.

78
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,595
你好  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

79
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:04,765
有什么需要帮忙的吗
Help you with anything?

80
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:07,425
有  我这周末要去参加一个
Yes, I'm attending a party this weekend

81
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,635
九十三岁老太太的生日派对
for a 93-year-old woman.

82
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,535
你能推荐份礼物吗
Can you recommend a gift?

83
00:03:13,505 --> 00:03:15,125
我也不知道
Uh, I don't know.

84
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:18,465
在亚瑟王神剑的末端弄个网球
Could put a tennis ball on the end of Excalibur.

85
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,015
一根酷到爆的拐杖就诞生了
Make a pretty badass cane.

86
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,085
-那你这卖网球吗  -不卖
- Do you supply the tennis ball?  - No.

87
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:25,265
那算了
Then no.

88
00:03:27,135 --> 00:03:28,345
还有什么
What else?

89
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:33,395
珍藏版的蝙蝠侠多功能腰带
Oh, have this collectors edition batman utility belt.

90
00:03:33,395 --> 00:03:37,095
也许她可以把这个系在身上当药罐
Maybe she can use it as a wearable pill caddy.

91
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:40,545
她要是不穿一整套的话
Well, she'd just look silly wearing that

92
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:42,705
光系腰带会显得很傻
without the rest of the costume.

93
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,365
抱歉  谢尔顿  没了  我江郎才尽了
I'm sorry Sheldon, that's it. That's all I got.

94
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,705
这不是你的错
Oh, it's not your fault.

95
00:03:48,705 --> 00:03:50,295
我已经去过模型火车店
I've been to the model train store.

96
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,735
无线电商店
I've been to Radio Shack.

97
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:54,255
这老太太的礼物可真难买
This woman is impossible to shop for.

98
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,285
要不是谢尔顿搞得到女人太让我震惊
I'd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems

99
00:03:57,285 --> 00:04:01,045
我早就开始取笑他连女人都搞不定了
if I wasn't in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.

100
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,795
没事  莱纳德  你尽管取笑我吧
No, Leonard, go ahead and mock.

101
00:04:03,795 --> 00:04:05,285
就像我父亲常说的
Like my daddy always said,

102
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:09,695
"谢利  唯女子与小人难养也"
"Shelly, women aren't anything but flippin' pains in the bottom."

103
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,895
你父亲是这么说话的吗
That's what your father used to say?

104
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,385
我自动把脏话和语助词去掉
Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw,

105
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:17,975
但大意不变
but you get the gist.

106
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:21,665
如果你不想去参加派对的话  就别去
Look, if you don't want to go to the party, just don't go.

107
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:23,085
你是个成年人
You're a grown man.

108
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:24,365
就得有成年人的样子
Act like one.

109
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,435
跟艾米说  你想这周末不回家
Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover

110
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,715
跟你的朋友们一起玩游戏
and playing video games with your friends.

111
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,605
没准她还会喜欢你这样呢
Maybe she'll dig it.

112
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,275
女人就喜欢立场坚定的男人[直译为坚定的掌舵手]
Women like a firm hand on the tiller.

113
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,515
我连舵[阴蒂]在哪都找不到
I can never find the tiller.

114
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,665
我还有本教学书呢  还是于事无补
I got a book; it didn't help.

115
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,465
是啊  我以前总是想如果朝一日我沦为奴隶
Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved,

116
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:49,045
那肯定是被另一个星球的高级物种奴役
it would be by an advanced species from another planet,

117
00:04:49,045 --> 00:04:51,535
而不是某个来自格兰岱尔市的小妞
not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale.

118
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,805
我下载了一个应用程序
Now, I downloaded an app that

119
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:58,005
没准对现在的情况会有帮助哦
might be helpful in this situation.

120
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:04,465
你说得没错
You're right.

121
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,715
我这么聪明
I'm smart as a whip.

122
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,715
whip一词多义  有鞭子和聪明的意思

123
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:07,185
肯定能找到解决办法的
I should be able to figure this out.

124
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,705
话说我这周末
Hey, listen, I kind of made plans

125
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,875
打算跟他们几个玩  不过后来我想
with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered,

126
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,955
我们正处在恋爱测试阶段
because we're in this relationship-beta-test,

127
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:19,315
我是不是应该先问问你的意见
if I should have asked you first.

128
00:05:19,315 --> 00:05:21,985
接着我又想  如果我真的先问你
Then I thought if I did check with you first,

129
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:24,925
你又可能觉得我对这段感情太认真了
then you'd think that I was taking things to seriously.

130
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,235
再后来  我就流鼻血了
And then-en I got a nosebleed.

131
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:30,745
你不用事事都先问我
You don't have to check with me.

132
00:05:30,745 --> 00:05:32,225
你想干什么就干什么
Do whatever you want.

133
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,845
这不是我期待的反应  不过没关系
I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay.

134
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:38,885
是吗  那你期待的是什么反应
Really, what were you hoping for?

135
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,905
我也不知道
I don't know,

136
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:42,295
或许你会小小地生气一下
maybe that you'd be a little upset,

137
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:43,795
然后意识到
and then you'd realize that

138
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:46,305
我是一匹向往自由的骏马
I'm a stallion that has to run free.

139
00:05:50,325 --> 00:05:52,325
这点会让你小小地性奋一下
And that would turn you on a little.

140
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,615
行  我是个演员  再问我一遍
Okay, I'm an actress. Ask me again.

141
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,635
你介意我这个周末
Do you mind if I spend the weekend

142
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:00,395
跟他们几个玩网游吗
playing video games with the guys?

143
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:02,145
什么  整个周末
Wha... the entire weekend?

144
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:03,935
那我岂不是见不到你了
You mean I wouldn't see you at all?

145
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:04,825
可我...
But I j...

146
00:06:04,825 --> 00:06:05,735
算了
No, no...

147
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:07,945
当初爱上你时我就知道了
I knew what I was getting into.

148
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:12,085
莱纳德这匹骏马是拴不住的
You can't put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter.

149
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:16,235
哎哟  屋子里好像变热了
Oh, my, is it getting hot in here?

150
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:17,855
源于西班牙语  用于调情

151
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:17,855
是么  宝贝
Ay, papi.

152
00:06:19,455 --> 00:06:21,085
是么  宝贝
Ay, papi?

153
00:06:22,085 --> 00:06:23,255
这是什么呀
What is that?

154
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,305
演技大发挥
An acting choice.

155
00:06:25,305 --> 00:06:27,685
这么说每次你性奋的时候
So you chose that when you become turned on,

156
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,415
墨西哥动画片《飞毛腿冈萨雷斯》

157
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:30,415
你就会变成飞毛鼠咯
you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?

158
00:06:32,055 --> 00:06:34,185
你有意见吗  宝贝
Choo got a problem with that, papi?

159
00:06:37,205 --> 00:06:40,505
佩妮  佩妮  佩妮
Penny! Penny! Penny!

160
00:06:40,805 --> 00:06:41,945
不好意思  骏马
Sorry, Stallion.

161
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:44,165
你的长颈鹿疯友来了
Your weird friend Giraffe is here.

162
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,555
你好  佩妮
Hello, Penny!

163
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,545
我是过来送你礼物的
I just stopped by to bring you this gift.

164
00:06:50,555 --> 00:06:52,205
小熊软糖  谢谢
Gummy bears? Thank you.

165
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,165
拿人家的手软  吃人家的嘴短
Now that you're in my debt...

166
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,895
麻烦你在艾米耳边吹吹风
...please manipulate Amy into releasing me

167
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:01,225
别让我去参加她姨妈的无聊生日派对
from my commitment to attend her aunt's tedious birthday party.

168
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:03,165
不可能
Not a chance.

169
00:07:03,165 --> 00:07:04,335
好吧
All right.

170
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,885
我早料到软糖可能使不动你
I thought the candy might not be enough

171
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,665
那我提高价码吧
so let me up the ante.

172
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:10,495
这有几张库珀礼券
These are Cooper Coupons.

173
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:13,455
可以让我为你做各种事
These are for various things I can do for you.

174
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,645
比如这张
Um, oh, this one

175
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:17,555
可提供一次免费的语法检查
is for one free grammar check.

176
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,785
我可以帮你检查电邮  信件
You could use it for emails, letters,

177
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,515
纹身等等  诸如此类的东西
tattoos, what have you.

178
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,685
这张可有趣了
Oh, this is fun one!

179
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:28,505
用这张可以跟我在加州科学中心共度下午
This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center,

180
00:07:28,505 --> 00:07:30,905
我会现场指出他们的错误
where I point out their mistakes.

181
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,145
注意一下使用期限
Keep an eye on those expiration dates,

182
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:36,175
我就被骗过不止一次
I've been burned more than once.

183
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:38,965
够了  亲爱的  我绝对不会
All right, sweetie, I'm not going to get involved

184
00:07:38,965 --> 00:07:40,115
干预你们的恋情
in your relationship.

185
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,305
拜托  不就是帮个忙嘛
Oh, come on. It's just a simple favor.

186
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:43,525
我上一次叫你帮我做事
Now, when's the last time I asked you

187
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,075
是什么时候
to do something for me?

188
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:46,625
昨天  你要我帮你看看
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear

189
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,805
你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

190
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:51,435
我上一次叫你帮我做非紧急医疗的事
When is the last time I asked you to do something

191
00:07:51,435 --> 00:07:53,335
是什么时候
that wasn't a medical emergency?

192
00:07:53,335 --> 00:07:54,685
昨天  你要我帮你看看
Yesterday. You made me look in your ear

193
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,895
你耳朵里是不是有瓢虫
to see if there was a ladybug in it.

194
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,575
好吧  我别无选择
All right, then, I have no choice

195
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:01,275
只有执行B计划了
but to go on to plan B.

196
00:08:01,275 --> 00:08:01,955
什么B计划
What's that?

197
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:02,835
我准备湿着头
I'm going to run around outside

198
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,945
去外面跑一圈  看看能不能感冒
with a wet head and try to catch a cold.

199
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:10,685
早上好
Good morning.

200
00:08:10,685 --> 00:08:11,865
早上好
Hello.

201
00:08:12,615 --> 00:08:14,745
我觉得你今天会玩得很开心的
I think you're really going to enjoy yourself today.

202
00:08:14,815 --> 00:08:16,635
你不但能见到我的亲戚
Not only do you get to meet my relatives,

203
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:18,865
而且因为我姨妈的派对是疗养院承办的
but since my aunt's nursing home is catering the party,

204
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,435
所以所有的食品都软绵绵的
all of the food is incredibly soft.

205
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:22,315
就像给你的牙齿放假一样
It's like a vacation for your teeth.

206
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:24,005
好的
All right.

207
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:27,885
你确定你想去吗
You sure you're okay with this?

208
00:08:27,945 --> 00:08:29,035
确定
Yes.

209
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,745
我决定找一个
I decided to find a way

210
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:34,445
即能出席派对又能玩得开心的方法
that I could have this experience and enjoy it.

211
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,665
谢谢  这对我来说意义重大
Thank you. That means a lot to me.

212
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:38,015
不用谢我
Oh, don't thank me.

213
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,825
要谢就谢无线技术
Thank wireless technology.

214
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:42,975
我发现即使出席你姨妈的无聊派对
I realized, I can go to your aunt's awful party

215
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:46,665
也一样能跟朋友们玩网游一整天
and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends.

216
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:50,615
谢尔顿  我的亲戚都想跟你聊聊
Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you,

217
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,765
而你却打算坐在一旁玩游戏吗
and you're going to be sitting there playing a game?

218
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,525
这未免太无礼了吧
Isn't that a little rude?

219
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,515
你放心  我有办法
Oh, I got that covered.

220
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,225
耳麦
Headset.

221
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,675
那些老家伙在说什么  我一个字都听不到
I won't hear a word the old geezers are saying.

222
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,325
既然你觉得玩游戏比
You know, if playing that game is more important to you

223
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,555
履行你对我的承诺还重要
than honoring your commitment to me,

224
00:09:07,555 --> 00:09:10,135
你也不介意我告诉大家我要带男友出席
and you don't mind me showing up at a party all by myself

225
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:12,345
结果却孤家寡人现身在派对上的话
after I've already told everybody I'll be bringing somebody,

226
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:13,945
那我没话说
then, fine.

227
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:15,585
你回家去玩游戏吧
Go home and play your game.

228
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,095
谢谢
Thanks.

229
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,105
对了
Ooh, listen,

230
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,115
我不介意你带一块生日蛋糕给我
I wouldn't mind a piece of birthday cake,

231
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:28,845
前提是老家伙吹蜡烛时口水没飙出来
provided the old gal's candle blow is clean and dry.

232
00:09:36,934 --> 00:09:38,394
东西齐了
Here you go.

233
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:41,194
我买了游戏期间我们需要的所有东西
I've got everything we'll need for the big game:

234
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,334
低脂火鸡肉干
low-fat turkey jerky...

235
00:09:44,464 --> 00:09:46,534
低碳水化合物啤酒
low-carb beer...

236
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,024
只有一百卡路里的零食
100-calorie snack pack...

237
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:54,014
男性染色体为XY  女人染性体为XX
缺乏Y染色体可能导致发育为娘娘腔

238
00:09:50,914 --> 00:09:52,424
你买东西的时候   有顺便买条Y染色体吗
You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there?

239
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,014
你也可能是没有Y染色体吧
You might be short one.

240
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,814
我是要在游戏里升级
Hey, I plan on leveling up in the game,

241
00:09:56,814 --> 00:09:59,584
不是要升级我的泳衣尺码  真谢谢你了
not my swimsuit size, thank you very much.

242
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:02,124
先生们  游戏给我们提供了选择
Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice,

243
00:10:02,124 --> 00:10:05,054
是选正义使者银河共和国呢
between playing for the Republic and the light side,

244
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:08,144
还是选大反派西斯帝国呢
or the Sith Empire and the dark side.

245
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:09,514
我们向来选做正义使者
Well, we're always the good guys.

246
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:10,884
在《龙与地下城》  咱是善良守法
In D&D, we're lawful good,

247
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:12,804
在《英雄之城》里  我们是英雄
in City Of Heroes, we're the heroes,

248
00:10:12,804 --> 00:10:13,984
在《侠盗猎车手》
and Grand Theft Auto,

249
00:10:13,984 --> 00:10:15,564
我们完事后立马付钱给妓女
we pay the prostitutes promptly,

250
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:17,314
还从不用球棒打她们
and never hit them with a bat.

251
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,804
是妓女啊
Those women are prostitutes?

252
00:10:24,244 --> 00:10:27,364
你说她们是在为干细胞研究募资
You said they were raising money for stem cell research.

253
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:31,714
伙计们  我有惊喜要给大家哦
Hey, guys, I got a surprise.

254
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,444
如果是帮助女性肠胃运动的酸奶
Hm, if it's yogurt that helps ladies poop,

255
00:10:33,444 --> 00:10:35,404
我觉得拉杰已经捷足先登了
I think Raj beat you to it.

256
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,484
不是  伯纳黛特要跟我们一起玩
No. Bernadette's going to be playing with us.

257
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:42,844
很不错吧  对吧  那是当然
So, that's pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah.

258
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:45,814
什么  你邀请了你的女友
What, you invited your girlfriend?!

259
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:48,104
这可是我们的男生周末
This is supposed to be our weekend!

260
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:50,104
我也没办法  昨晚她说
I had no choice. Last night, she said,

261
00:10:50,104 --> 00:10:51,454
我们明天一起吃早午餐吧
"Why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow

262
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:52,724
然后再去植物园
and then maybe the Arboretum."

263
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:53,824
我说  不行
And I said, "Well, no,

264
00:10:53,824 --> 00:10:54,884
我答应他们几个
I promised the guys I was going to

265
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:56,244
周末一起玩游戏的
play a video game with them all weekend."

266
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:57,474
然后她说  听起来挺好玩的
And she said, "That sounds like fun.

267
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,184
我能加入吗
Can I come, too?"

268
00:10:58,184 --> 00:11:00,234
我沉默了一会儿  然后她说
And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said,

269
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:01,554
你是不想让我一起吗
"Well, do you not want me to come?"

270
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:03,114
然后我就给她买了个新笔记本和一套游戏
And then I bought her a new laptop and the game,

271
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:04,934
然后她现在正在停车呢
and she's parking the car right now.

272
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:08,914
鞭子抽男人的程序
Is the whip sound app

273
00:11:08,914 --> 00:11:10,564
符合此情此景吗
contextually appropriate here?

274
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:14,044
可以  但我觉得你等得有点久
Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long

275
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,744
笑点都过去了
for it to be funny.

276
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:21,964
我说错了  还是很搞笑
I was wrong; it's still funny.

277
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:23,214
太好了
Oh, good.

278
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,924
艾米  怎么了
Amy, what's wrong?

279
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,664
我男友是个混球
My boyfriend's a jerk.

280
00:11:35,774 --> 00:11:37,334
好吧  他肯定不是劈腿
Well, I know he didn't cheat on you,

281
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:38,754
那是什么事
so what happened?

282
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:42,724
我孤家寡人参加我姨妈的派对
I had to go to my aunt's party all by myself,

283
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:44,094
人人都嘲弄我说
and everybody was like,

284
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,684
"你那个总挂在嘴边的男朋友呢"
"Where's this boyfriend you're always talking about?

285
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:47,484
"是真有其人  还是你编出来的呀"
"Is he real, or did you make him up like Armen,

286
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,344
比如之前那个小马农阿曼"
the miniature horse breeder?"

287
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,984
谁是小马农阿曼
Who's Armen the miniature horse breeder?

288
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:57,394
是我为了摆脱家人唠叨  而捏造出来的男友
The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back.

289
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,374
但很快就被揭穿了  因为我答不上来
It unraveled quickly when I couldn't answer the question

290
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:00,914
"你俩怎么认识的"
"How'd you two meet?"

291
00:12:02,704 --> 00:12:04,604
要是我  我会说是在一场小马秀上
I would have thought at a miniature horse show.

292
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:05,924
这答案不错
Oh, that's good.

293
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:10,224
我慌了神  便说是在伍德斯托克音乐节
I panicked and said Woodstock.

294
00:12:11,954 --> 00:12:14,394
我只是想在我家人面前炫耀一下谢尔顿
I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.

295
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,924
当然啦  我懂的
Sure, I get that.

296
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,864
他是你的初恋男友嘛
I mean, he's your first boyfriend and all.

297
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:20,074
他不仅是我初恋男友  还是最好的男友
Not just my first boyfriend, he's the best boyfriend.

298
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,914
你想想
I mean, think about it.

299
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:24,174
我在跟谢尔顿・库珀交往哎
I'm dating Sheldon Cooper.

300
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:27,634
没错
Yes.

301
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:29,064
还别有用心
On purpose.

302
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:32,134
他帅气十足  身材修长
He's handsome, he's lanky,

303
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:33,664
才华横溢
he's brilliant,

304
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:36,604
而且他的皮肤苍白无血色
and his skin has that pale, waxy quality.

305
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,324
吸血鬼式的病态肤色的确是新性感指标
Well, sickly is the new sexy.

306
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,484
没错
Yeah.

307
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,024
艾米
You know, Amy,

308
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:49,144
有时候  当你跟你真正喜欢的人
sometimes when you're in a relationship with someone

309
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:51,434
谈恋爱时  不好的地方是
you really care about, the sucky part is,

310
00:12:51,434 --> 00:12:53,394
会让你更容易受伤
it leaves you open to getting hurt.

311
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:56,084
你担心过莱纳德这么对你吗
Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?

312
00:12:56,524 --> 00:12:58,474
问得真搞笑  从来没有
That's hilarious. No.

313
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,584
干掉他  干掉他
Get that guy! Get that guy!

314
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:07,284
罗斯坦考夫斯基博士
Dr. Rostenkowski,

315
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:08,734
要知道
it may interest you to know

316
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:11,564
你这样瞎喊还不如
that saying "Pew, pew, pew" isn't as effective

317
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,954
直接按爆炸键有效
as pressing your blaster key.

318
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,824
同样  再怎么乱叫
In the same way that saying "Whee!"

319
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:18,134
陆行艇也不会跑起来
doesn't make the land speeder go.

320
00:13:23,334 --> 00:13:25,604
拉杰  帝国军队接近你了
Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail.

321
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:27,254
搞定了
Got him.

322
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:30,174
当甘地提倡他的非暴力理论时
When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence,

323
00:13:30,174 --> 00:13:33,184
他肯定不明白打打杀杀有多痛快
I bet he didn't know how much fun it was killing stuff.

324
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,634
好了  我们把他们全杀光了
All right, I think we got them all.

325
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:38,144
分战利品吧
Let's divide up the loot.

326
00:13:38,144 --> 00:13:40,864
看我拿到的这件漂亮的紫色长袍
Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got.

327
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:43,214
你也该穿上你的  咱俩多搭呀
You should put on yours and then we'll match.

328
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:45,794
我费了好大劲才得到这身盔甲
But I worked hard to get this armor.

329
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:47,404
抱歉  我只是觉得
Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice

330
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,534
让别人看出咱俩是一对很有爱
if people knew we were a couple.

331
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:52,744
好吧  我换
Fine, I'll change.

332
00:14:06,384 --> 00:14:08,604
-我不想玩游戏  -拜托
- I don't think I want to play a game. - Oh, come on!

333
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:10,904
他们在对门玩得不亦乐乎  咱也该玩玩
They're playing one across the hall-- we should, too.

334
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:14,094
好了  我们轮流往桌子上扔硬币
Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter

335
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,054
如果谁把它弹到这个杯子里
off the table, and if it goes into this cup,

336
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,514
另一个人就得喝一杯
the other person has to drink.

337
00:14:17,514 --> 00:14:19,024
然后你再继续
Then you get to go again...

338
00:14:24,084 --> 00:14:25,194
像这样吗
Like that?

339
00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,514
没错  新手运气好而已
Wow. Yeah, b-beginner's luck.

340
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:30,244
现在呢  我把这一整杯啤酒喝掉
So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer,

341
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,194
然后你再继续
and you will go again...

342
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:37,304
好吧
All right.

343
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:40,174
现在我就喝光这杯酒
So, yeah, okay, now I'm gonna drink this entire cup

344
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,664
然后再喝掉一杯
and then I'm going to drink another one.

345
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,744
行了  说真的  住手  搞毛啊
Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?

346
00:14:46,444 --> 00:14:47,394
我小时候经常
Spent a lot of my childhood

347
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:50,004
往许愿池扔硬币  希望能有朋友
throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends.

348
00:14:50,004 --> 00:14:51,334
到了某种程度  你就会开始玩花样
At a certain point, you start doing trick shots

349
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:53,034
好让这游戏不那么枯燥
just to keep things interesting.

350
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:56,394
等我喝完再投  等等
Whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on.

351
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,774
那是我男朋友的声音
That'd be my boyfriend

352
00:15:00,824 --> 00:15:03,194
宁愿和朋友玩无趣的星际迷航游戏
happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends

353
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,554
也不愿跟我一起出去
than hanging out with me.

354
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:06,854
-是大战  -什么
- Wars. - What?

355
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:07,874
是星际大战
Star Wars.

356
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,124
把这俩搞错的话  他们会大发雷霆的
They get all cranky when you mix the two up.

357
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,244
有什么区别吗
What's the difference?

358
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,654
绝对没区别
There's absolutely no difference.

359
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:18,404
怎样才能让他对我更好呢
How do I get him to treat me better?

360
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:19,894
好吧
All right.

361
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:22,034
我来给你上上女友基础课程吧
Let me give you a little girlfriend 101.

362
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,494
通常使出的第一招
Usually the first move out of the gate

363
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:25,424
不跟他滚床单
is you withhold sex,

364
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,504
但这招得等谢尔顿到青春期后才有用
but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty.

365
00:15:28,574 --> 00:15:31,774
所以  我认为
So, I'd say...

366
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,694
对他采取不予理睬政策
give him the silent treatment.

367
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,024
不行  他爱死这样了
No, he loves that.

368
00:15:36,234 --> 00:15:37,604
我们俩共处一个房间
Our record for sitting in a room together

369
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,414
但互相不讲话的记录是六个半小时
and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours.

370
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,284
他还说那晚他过得很开心
He said it was a magical evening.

371
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:45,004
好吧  那我们就只能采取
All right, then we're gonna have to go

372
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:46,344
最古老也最有效的那招了
with an oldie but goodie;

373
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:48,004
大吵大闹
making a scene.

374
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:49,494
这个我可不大擅长
I don't think I'd be good at that.

375
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:50,844
所以说有我这闺蜜你幸运死了
That's why you're lucky to have me.

376
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:52,524
在我家乡奥马哈  有餐厅不允许我进去
Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants

377
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,204
就是红辣椒饭店  我还被黑名单了两次
I'm not allowed into. Both Chili's.

378
00:15:59,264 --> 00:16:02,084
伯纳黛特  记住你是我们团的补血师
Bernadette, remember, your character's the healer in our group.

379
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:05,014
你不能只给霍华德回血  要给大家回啊
You're in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard.

380
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,374
我情不自禁嘛
I can't help it.

381
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:08,924
我的华仔小巫师受伤了呢
My Howie Wowie has an owie.

382
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:12,984
这真是我所听过的
That is the most sickeningly sweet thing

383
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:15,314
最恶心的甜言蜜语
I have ever experienced.

384
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:18,394
我正用"蜡烛糖"吸"酷A果汁"呢
And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.

385
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,124
谢尔顿・库珀  我有帐要跟你算
Sheldon Cooper, I've got a bone to pick with you,

386
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:25,954
我要当着你所有朋友的面算这笔帐
and I'm about to do it in front of all your friends.

387
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,564
没错  跟他好好算账  算得他裤衩都保不住
Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!

388
00:16:29,634 --> 00:16:31,064
我要当众羞辱你
I'm gonna publicly shame you,

389
00:16:31,064 --> 00:16:32,704
然后我就坐等社会的压力
and then sit back as societal pressure

390
00:16:32,704 --> 00:16:34,624
迫使你修正自己的行为
compels you to modify your behavior.

391
00:16:34,624 --> 00:16:37,244
迎头痛击啊
Ooh, buuurn!

392
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:40,154
如果你以后还不对我好一点
And if you don't start treating me better,

393
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:40,764
我就跟你分手
I'm leaving you

394
00:16:40,764 --> 00:16:43,144
然后跟小马农阿曼一起
for a miniature horse breeder named Armen.

395
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:46,554
哪个阿曼
Armen who?

396
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:48,604
阿文就是...见鬼
Armen... damn it.

397
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:53,924
谢尔顿  她想在家人面前炫耀一下你
Look, Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family,

398
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,584
你却放她鸽子  好吧
and you stood her up, okay?

399
00:16:55,874 --> 00:16:58,274
看看她这可爱又伤感的表情
Look at this adorable, smushy face.

400
00:16:58,274 --> 00:17:00,604
多伤感  多痛苦  多郁闷啊
Smush, smush, smush.

401
00:17:01,764 --> 00:17:02,684
你弄痛我了
You're hurting me.

402
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:05,794
错  弄痛你的是谢尔顿
No, Sheldon hurt you.

403
00:17:06,264 --> 00:17:08,114
之前他让我心痛  现在是你让我脸痛
Before; now it's you.

404
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,694
我明白了
I think I understand.

405
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:13,834
这世界上只有你一个
You're the one person

406
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:16,624
可以说谢尔顿・库珀是你男友
who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend,

407
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,014
但这话毕竟有些空洞
but that rings hollow

408
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:20,774
如果你不能让他亲自去证明
if you can't lord him over others in the flesh.

409
00:17:22,104 --> 00:17:23,994
我忘了  我能让他们蓬荜生辉
I forget what I bring to the party

410
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:26,154
我走后  也会让他们怅然若失
and what I take away when I leave.

411
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:31,814
请接受这些珍贵的库珀优惠券
Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons...

412
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,764
就当补偿你吧
...as restitution.

413
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,414
谢尔顿  她才不要你这些傻不拉唧的...
Sheldon, she doesn't want your stupid...

414
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,064
科学中心  现在使用
Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming.

415
00:17:39,064 --> 00:17:40,034
出发吧
Let's go.

416
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:44,384
干得好  艾米・菲拉・福勒
Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler.

417
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:46,034
等我穿件外套
Let me get my coat.

418
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:49,394
长大点吧  莱纳德
Oh, grow up, Leonard.

419
00:17:51,014 --> 00:17:52,154
各位打断一下
But e-excuse me,

420
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,834
我有话要说
I have something to say.

421
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:57,294
你们可能都没意识到
None of you may realize it,

422
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:59,784
但我真的很期待这个周末
but I was very much looking forward to this weekend.

423
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:01,354
就像回到了从前
It was gonna be like the old days--

424
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,894
在你们几个各自有女朋友之前
the four of us hanging out playing video games

425
00:18:03,894 --> 00:18:06,864
我们四个聚在一起玩游戏
before you guys all got girlfriends.

426
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,104
你们到底知不知道
Do you have any idea what it's like

427
00:18:08,104 --> 00:18:11,174
只有我一个人没女朋友  是什么心情呀
to be the only one without a girlfriend?

428
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,644
即使我哪天有了女友
Even if I get one someday,

429
00:18:12,644 --> 00:18:17,024
我仍是最后一名  比谢尔顿还晚泡到妞
I'll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!

430
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:24,524
看  女人就是这么大吵大闹的
And that's how a girl makes a scene.

431
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:30,404
抱歉  亲爱的
I'm sorry, sweetie.

432
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:32,054
你说得对  你该好好度周末
You're right. You deserve your weekend.

433
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,284
来吧艾米  我们走
Come on, Amy, let's go.

434
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:34,884
那科学中心什么时候能去啊
What about the Science Center?

435
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:37,254
我喝高呕吐的时候  让你搂着我头发
I'll let you hold my hair while I throw up.

436
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,744
改天再去吧
Rain check.

437
00:18:42,274 --> 00:18:43,564
我也该走了
I'm gonna go, too.

438
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:45,444
-我会想你的  -我才想你呢
- I'll miss you. - I'll miss you.

439
00:18:45,444 --> 00:18:46,874
-我更想你  -我才更想...
- I'll miss you more. - No, I'll...

440
00:18:46,874 --> 00:18:48,544
快走吧
Just leave!

441
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:54,064
好了
Okay, now.

442
00:18:54,454 --> 00:18:56,014
本来就应该这样
This is the way it's supposed to be.

443
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,894
男人齐聚  共同杀敌
Men together, fighting the forces of evil.

444
00:18:58,964 --> 00:19:00,304
说得对
Hear! Hear!

445
00:19:03,144 --> 00:19:05,644
真不敢相信这一瓶只有64大卡
I can't believe this is only 64 calories.

446
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,965
霍华德・乔尔・沃罗威茨
Howard Joel Wolowitz!

447
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:23,745
我整整担心了你两天
I've been worried sick for two days,

448
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,265
我知道你把手机关了
and I know you turned off your phone!

449
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:30,495
马上给我开门
You open up this door right now

450
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:32,485
老娘都走到这来找你了
because I've had it up to here!

451
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,585
停尸房和医院我都找了一圈
I have been to the morgue and the hospital,

452
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,325
这该死的楼梯
and I spent the last half hour

453
00:19:36,335 --> 00:19:39,225
让我爬了半个小时
walking up these ferkakta stairs!

454
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,035
老娘在召唤  我该走了
That's my ride; got to go.
