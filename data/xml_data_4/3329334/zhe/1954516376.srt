1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,658
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
MAN: Previously on The Originals.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,328
- 你是克劳斯的父亲
- 你能让我复活
-You're Klaus' father?
-You can bring me back to life.

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,474
欢迎来到我的地狱
-(GASPS)
-Welcome to my hell.

4
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:12,202
你没事了
你是不是梦到我们父亲了？
You're all right.
Have you dreamt of our father?

5
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:14,540
- 我见到麦可了
- 我最近也经常梦到他
-I saw Mikael.
-I've been dreaming of him, too.

6
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,478
你母亲显然是个极有天赋的女巫
Your mother is clearly
a very gifted witch.

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,312
不管我怎么想
结局都是我和我的人会死
Any way I do the math,
it ends with me and my guys dead.

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,546
所以不管你和狼人在密谋着什么
So whatever it is you got coming
with the wolves,

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:25,316
你要知道，我会一直奋战到最后一刻
just know that I will fight
until I am dead!

10
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:31,652
干得漂亮
WOMAN: Nice job.

11
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,665
帮我省了亲自杀死这些吸血鬼的麻烦
You saved me the trouble
of killing all these vampires myself.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,862
那个孩子有女巫的血统
That baby is part witch.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,099
她必须先出生然后再死
She has to be born first
before she can die.

14
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,004
- 不要
- 只能这样了
-No!
-This is the way it had to be.

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:58,980
在给你众多的追求者之一写情书吗？
KLAUS: Writing a love letter
to one of your many suitors?

16
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:05,894
谁是那个幸运的收信者？
杰克森还是以利亚？
So who's the lucky recipient then.
Jackson or Elijah?

17
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:09,365
可别说是我
Don't tell me it's me.

18
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,697
我以为我早就出局了呢
I thought I was out of the running
ages ago.

19
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:14,635
最自大狂奖项要颁给…
The award for biggest ego goes to....

20
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,741
我们的狼宝宝还好吗？
How is our littlest wolf?

21
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,044
你想不想…
Do you want to....

22
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,892
来吧
Come on.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,611
你感觉到了吗？
-(GASPS)
-(LAUGHS) Feel that?

24
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,048
好吧
Right.

25
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:06,383
我就不打扰你写信了
I'll leave you
to your secret letter then.

26
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,832
亲爱的柔伊
HAYLEY: Dear Zoey.

27
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:21,633
凯特琳，或是安琪拉
Or Caitlin or Angela.

28
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,470
我亲爱的女儿
To my little girl...

29
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,581
你父亲刚问我这是不是一封情书
your dad just asked
if this was a love letter. (CHUCKLES)

30
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,242
我想也算是吧
I guess it kind of is.

31
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,818
我没有机会认识我母亲
HAYLEY: I never got
to know my mother.

32
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,323
所以我也不知道她怀着我时是什么心情
I have no idea what she must have
felt when she carried me.

33
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,858
放开我，你这贱人！
Let go of me, you bitch!

34
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,688
所以我想写这封信给你
HAYLEY: So I thought
I'd write to you

35
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:50,859
好让你知道此刻我有多么开心
so that you could know how happy
I am at this very moment.

36
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,200
我和你父亲都迫不及待想见到你
How much your father and I
can't wait to meet you.

37
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,104
我还想向你保证
And I want to make you a promise,

38
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,271
三样我从未有拥有过的东西
three things that you will have
that I never did.

39
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,678
一个安全的家
A safe home,

40
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,254
有人每天说爱你
someone to tell you
that they love you every single day

41
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,118
并且无条件守护着你
and someone to fight for you
no matter what.

42
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,960
换句话说，一个家
HAYLEY: In other words, a family.

43
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,757
就这样了，宝贝女儿
So there you go, baby girl.

44
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:21,457
其他的就让我们以后一起共同努力吧
The rest we're going to
have to figure out together.

45
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,865
我爱你，妈妈
I love you. Your mom.

46
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,741
你要知道这么做我也很痛苦
You should know
this brings me no joy.

47
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,471
我保证会速战速决的
-I promise I'll make it quick.
-(SCREAMlNG)

48
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,308
我们开始吧
Let's begin, shall we?

49
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,540
不，不要
No, no, no!

59

他也没比我好多少
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
I gave as good as I got,

60
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,370
但我们需要克劳斯的血才能治愈

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,186
你和克劳斯交手
You fought Klaus.

00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,348
- 他流血了吗？
- 我确实将他伤得不轻

63
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,220
在哪里？
Where?

64
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:48,116
黛维娜
Uh, Davina.

65
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,448
你在干什么？
What the hell?

66
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,748
小约，你来这里干什么？
Josh, what are you doing here?

67
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,087
我不是叫你好好休息吗？
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
I told you to rest.

68
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,092
我没事
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
-I'm fine.

69
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,320
你很快就会产生幻觉了
-You're going to start hallucinating soon.

70
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,894
除非我的幻觉就是
制片：兰斯安德森
I mean, unless I'm hallucinating you

71
00:04:57,063 --> 00:05:00,430
你莫名其妙站在马路中央，念着咒语
standing in the middle of the street
and chanting for no reason. (LAUGHS)

72
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,763
等等，这真的是幻觉吗？
Wait. Am l?

73
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:07,906
我会救你的
我会救你们所有人
I'm going to save you.
I'm going to save all of you.

77
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,590
看来我产生幻觉了
 I am hallucinating.

78
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,830
- 你们都不得好死
- 再用力，宝宝快出来了
-I will bring hell to your doorstep!
-One last push. Baby's almost here.

79
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,869
我要用你们的鲜血沐浴
I will bathe
in rivers of your blood.

80
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,303
- 我看到宝宝了
- 好了，现在用力
-I can see the baby.
-Okay, now push.

81
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,376
- 慢慢来，慢慢来
- 你们都将尖叫着死去
-Gently, gently.
-You will die screaming!

82
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,638
好了
There.

83
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,626
是个漂亮的小女孩
You have a beautiful baby daughter.

84
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,434
清晨月亮落下时
We must start the sacrifice

85
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,469
我们就必须开始献祭
as soon as the moon sets
with the morning sky.

86
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,106
求求你
Please.

87
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,299
能让我抱抱她吗？
Please, can I hold her?

88
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,356
不！
No!

89
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,050
海莉
Hayley!

90
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,313
不
No.

91
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,502
她死了
She's gone.

92
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,781
你被咬了
KLAUS: You've been bitten.

93
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,730
这些只够一个人喝
There's only enough here for one.

94
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,667
不，一定够的
No. This has to be enough.

95
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,180
我没法选择
I can't choose.

96
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,024
求求你别逼我做选择
Please don't make me choose.

97
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,027
去救你的朋友吧
Save your friend.

98
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,629
我来照顾其他人
I can take care of the rest of us.

99
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,500
- 马赛尔
- 我不要
-Marcel.
-I can't.

100
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,835
看看你的伤口
你没时间废话了
Judging by the look of that bite,
you don't have time to argue.

101
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,807
马赛尔
Marcel.

102
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,412
小约是我的人
Josh is one of my guys.

103
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,540
今天我的人死得够多了
快喝吧
Enough of my guys have died today,
so come on.

104
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,321
你得一分
One point for you...

105
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,662
尼克劳斯也得一分
and one point for Niklaus. (ECHOlNG)

106
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,144
嘿
你要去哪？
Hey.
Where do you think you're going?

107
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:47,480
去找克劳斯，拿他的血
尽全力救我的手下
To find Klaus, get his blood, and
save as many of my guys as I can.

108
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,587
等等
Wait.

109
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,883
这样的话，你需要武器
For that, you'll need a weapon.

110
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,857
正好我有个武器库
And it just so happens
I have an arsenal.

111
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,105
- 怎么会这样？
- 我被打败了
-How?
-I was bested.

112
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,178
你被打败了？
You were bested?

113
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:24,154
你…
居然会被打败！
You were bested!

114
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:26,817
我战无不胜的弟弟
My invincible brother.

115
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,430
她们带走了孩子，但还有时间
They took the baby
but there's still time.

116
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,663
我们可以救她
We can save her.

117
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,778
墓地都空了，这地方都荒废了
她不在这里
Tombs are empty, the grounds
are deserted. She's not here!

118
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,381
她们只可能来这
我们要继续找
This is the only place they can be.
We'll keep searching.

119
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,517
她们不在这里，尼克劳斯
我们在浪费时间
They are not here, Niklaus.
We're wasting time!

120
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:55,245
她们的收获仪式在这里
收割仪式也在这里
Their harvest was here,
the reaping was here.

121
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,618
她们现在就要举行仪式
去祭祀她们的祖先
They are about to perform a ritual which
will feed their ancestors for centuries,

122
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,851
而她们的祖先就是埋在这里的
ancestors who are buried here.

123
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:09,324
这个雕像
This statue.

124
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:14,235
我们已经路过它三次了
我们一直都是朝同一个方向走
We've passed by this three times, all
whilst going in the same direction.

125
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,914
她们一定施了某种幻觉咒语了
They have fabricated
some kind of illusion.

126
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,357
看来你说得没错
That's one word for it.

127
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,156
- 这就是基兰隐藏的东西
- 说储藏更确切点
-So this is what Kieran was hiding.
-More like stockpiling.

128
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:06,621
我看了一下，基本上都是些武器
From what I can gather,
it's mostly weapons.

129
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,158
都是女巫制造出来的黑暗魔物
Dark objects created by witches.

130
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,852
被人类所借用
And co-opted by the humans.

131
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,065
基兰多年来一直守着这个秘密
Kieran's been keeping this
a secret for years.

132
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,099
你确定要给我看这些东西吗？
You sure you want to show me all this?

133
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,864
你说过得知我叔叔的秘密会害我丧命
You said knowing my uncle's secrets
could get me killed.

134
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,441
但要是这些秘密能拯救我的朋友呢？
But what if those same secrets
could save the lives of my friends?

135
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,942
看这个
我在学校里学过
Look at this.
I learned about it in the Lycee.

136
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,944
它叫做恶魔之星
It's called the Devil's Star.

137
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,242
据说投掷一次就能造成一千道伤口
They say one throw
can make a thousand cuts.

138
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:35,217
一千道伤口听起来不错
我就是要让克劳斯流血
A thousand cuts sounds about right.
I need to make Klaus bleed.

139
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:43,919
这东西太妙了
It's ingenious.

140
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,588
我看得见它们，也感觉得到它们
但它们并不存在
I can see them, I can feel them,
and yet they are not real.

141
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,791
一定有办法
There has to be a way.

142
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:52,096
- 要是能直接离开这里就好了
- 我们需要集中精力
-Even if we could just push through--
-What we need to do is focus.

143
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,432
我现在唯一关心的就是孩子和她的安危
My only focus right now is that child
and her safety.

144
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,733
你懂吗？
Do you understand me?

145
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,000
这一切
This, all of this.

146
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,667
这一切就是你创造的世界，尼克劳斯
This is the world
that you created, Niklaus.

147
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,473
- 哥哥
- 你的那些阴谋
-Brother--
-All of your scheming,

148
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,707
你可悲的一生每天都在树敌
the enemies that you have made
every day of your miserable life.

149
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,442
你还指望有什么结果？
What results did you expect?

150
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,916
你难道觉得你的孩子能过着幸福的生活
That your child would be born
into a happy life?

151
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,023
而她的母亲可以好好活着
看着她长大吗？
That the mother would be alive
to know her daughter?

152
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,955
亦或我们可以像普通家庭一样
安定地生活？
That we could live and thrive
as some sort of family?

153
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,756
- 那是你的幻想，不是我的！
- 不！弟弟。

154
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,990
这曾是我们的希望
This was our hope.

155
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,158
是我们家的希望
This was our family's hope.

156
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,165
但现在她不在了
And now she is gone.

157
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,741
你明白吗？
我让她进入了我的生活
Do you understand?
I let this person in.

158
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,548
我接纳了她
I let her in.

159
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,184
我从不接纳任何人的
I don't let people in.

160
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,015
你明知道这一点
却还是将她从我身边夺走
You knew this,
and you've taken her from me.

161
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,984
我需要她，而你毁了我
I needed her,
and you've broken me.

162
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,940
等我们救下你侄女
You can tell your niece

163
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:17,885
你可以告诉她
你有多在乎她母亲
how much you cared for her mother
when we save her.

164
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,720
用力
Push.

165
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,429
不！
No!

166
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,310
天快亮了，月亮差不多隐没了
The moon has almost faded
from the morning sky.

167
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,284
我得做好准备
I need to prepare.

168
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,699
她一定会进行到底
祖先们已保证她会活下去
She'll go through with it.
The ancestors promised her her life.

169
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,459
那他们对我们的保证呢？
What about their promise to us?

170
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,433
收获祭上四个女孩牺牲，四个女孩复活
Four harvest girls sacrificed,
four girls returned.

171
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,438
但她的朋友破坏了一切
我们的朋友就不能复活了吗？
But her friends hijack it,
and ours have to stay dead?

172
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,371
凯西是我们的朋友
Cassie was our friend.

173
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:46,972
我希望她进行不下去
I hope she doesn't go through
with it.

174
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,546
然后由我们来完成祖先的愿望
Then you and l
can do what the ancestors want,

175
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,239
他们就会把凯西还给我们
and they'll give us Cassie.

176
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,917
洁妮薇就可以回到她该去的地方了
And drag Genevieve
back to where she came from.

177
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,788
是时候了
It's time.

178
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:39,256
上面说我必须从连结漩涡中获取能量
It says I need to channel power
from a Nexus Vorti.

179
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,126
是啊
(LAUGHS) Ah, yes.

180
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,430
我妻子艾丝塔总是喜欢夸张一点的说法
My wife, Esther, always did love
to dress things up a bit.

181
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,629
只是女巫的说法而已
It's fancy witch speak.

182
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,774
连结漩涡，一种很罕见的现象
Nexus Vorti.
A rare occurrence.

183
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,878
极其罕见
甚至可以说是奇迹
Something so infrequent,
it's almost a miracle

184
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:57,015
比如占星术中的事件，或是…
Iike an astrological event, or...

185
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,083
- 一个奇迹般的孩子
- 没错
-A miracle baby.
- Voila.

186
00:17:11,997 --> 00:17:15,262
你确定你有能力让我复活吗？
Are you certain you have the power
to bring me back?

187
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:18,497
我现在有了
I do now.

188
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:56,401
我们是第二次经过这里了
We've passed through here
twice already.

189
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,009
快没时间了
-We're running out of time.
-(CLATTERlNG)

190
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:01,203
那就动作快点
Then we move faster.

191
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,972
或更聪明点
HAYLEY: Or smarter.

192
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,687
海莉
Hayley.

193
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,922
海莉
Hayley.

194
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,894
你怎么会来这里？
How are you here?

195
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:30,735
我在教堂里醒来
我感觉到饥饿
I woke up in the church.
I felt this hunger.

196
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,340
我知道我需要什么
I knew what I needed.

197
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,908
我感觉得到她
I can feel her.

198
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,717
她就在这里
She's here.

199
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,620
我感觉得到我的孩子
I can feel my baby.

200
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,729
你死的时候，孩子的血还在你体内
You died with the baby's blood
still in your system.

201
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,425
她正在转变
She's in transition.

202
00:18:56,668 --> 00:19:00,968
也就是说，她要想活命
必须喝孩子的血
Which means she has to drink the
blood of the child if she's to survive.

203
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,775
这样才能成为混合种
To be a reborn hybrid.

204
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,609
我不在乎自己
I don't care about me.

205
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,874
我要去找我们的女儿
I'm going to go find our daughter.

206
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,795
尘灰成骨
骨肉重组
From ash to bone,
from bone to flesh,

207
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:26,430
魂归人间
from flesh to life.

208
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:58,456
不！
No!

209
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:11,904
你们这群傻瓜
You fools!

210
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,409
在我们最强大的时候
来到我们能量的聚集地
To come against us
in our place of power,

211
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,377
与我们作对
in our strongest hour.

212
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,015
你们面对的不是三个人
You don't face three.

213
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,344
是我们所有人
You face us all.

214
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,087
你是谁？
MAN: Who the hell are you?

215
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,253
不！
No! (SCREAMS)

216
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:34,917
不！
No!

217
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,094
我来晚了
I was too late.

218
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:27,135
应该可以有更多时间的
There should have been more time.

219
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,841
看来狼人们回来把事情做了个了结
Looks like the wolves came back
and finished what they started.

220
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,254
你抢走我女儿
就为了让我治愈你和你朋友
You took my daughter so l
would heal you and your friends.

221
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,523
来
Here.

222
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,597
这个咬伤
This bite.

223
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,469
所有的这一切
All this.

224
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:00,912
我知道不是没有原因的
I know it didn't come from nowhere.

225
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:08,480
一个世纪前，我把你父亲引来这里
开始了这一切
This is the last note in a song
that I started a century ago.

226
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,313
如今到了结局之时
When I brought your dad to town.

227
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,888
为此，我很抱歉
And for that, I am sorry.

228
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,893
不
No.

229
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,030
你救了我孩子的命，马赛尔
You saved my child's life, Marcel.

230
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:36,781
因此
这是你应得的
For that, you deserve this.

231
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:49,222
我们会打倒
造成这一切的罪魁祸首
We will take down
whoever brought this upon us.

232
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,822
我发誓
I swear it.

233
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,706
能让我抱抱吗？
May l?

234
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,484
嘿
Hey.

235
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,327
你好啊
Hey there.

236
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,221
- 住手
- 不
-Stop! Ah!
-No.

237
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,456
为什么会这样？
Why is this happening?

238
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,395
你复活我是为了杀我儿子
You brought me back to kill my son.

239
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,365
我复活你是为了惩罚他
I brought you back to punish him.

240
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,164
等我准备好了你自然会有机会
And you will when I'm ready
and not a minute before.

241
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:18,503
你到底做了什么？
What have you done?

242
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:24,411
我在你的复活咒语里加了点别的东西
I added a little something extra
in the spell that brought you back.

243
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,883
我耗费了八个月的生命
待在这当秘密武器
I spent eight months of my life here
being used as a secret weapon.

244
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:32,047
现在你也能体会一下这感受
Now you can see how it feels.

245
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:35,718
跪下
Kneel.

246
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,561
为什么？
Why?

247
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,364
祖先们没有给我选择的余地
The ancestors left me no choice.

248
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,906
你想牺牲一个无辜的婴儿
以获得更多力量
You were willing to sacrifice
an innocent baby for more power.

249
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,044
不只是力量
Oh, not just power.

250
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:55,076
那是祖先的决定
It was the ancestors' decree.

251
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,912
是她的决定
It was her decree.

252
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,315
谁的决定？
It was whose decree?

253
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:04,717
我很惊讶你会这么问
I'm surprised you have to ask.

254
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,757
毕竟正是你说服了你的弟弟妹妹
After all, you were the one
who convinced your siblings

255
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,952
在纽奥良的土地上将她献祭
to consecrate her
in New Orleans soil.

256
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,287
艾丝塔
Esther.

257
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:24,403
所以即便死亡也无法阻止我母亲
灭绝她亲骨肉的决心
So not even death can stop my mother
from seeking the annihilation
of her own flesh and blood.

258
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,806
这并不是终结
This isn't the end.

259
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,605
只要那个孩子还活着
As long as that child lives,

260
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,874
纽奥良的女巫就不会停止追杀她
the witches of New Orleans
will never stop coming for it.

261
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,713
艾丝塔永远不会停止追杀她
Esther will never stop
coming for it.

262
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,286
一切都已经决定了
It has been decreed.

263
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:40,424
你的孩子将被献祭给祖先们
Your baby will be consecrated
among her ancestors.

264
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:42,287
她活不了的
She will not live.

265
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,794
他们也来找我了
我能感觉到
They're coming for me.
I can feel it.

266
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,957
我让他们失望了
I've failed them.

267
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,294
求求你们
Please.

268
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,962
请理解，我只是想活下去
Understand, I just wanted to live.

269
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:02,172
告诉克劳斯
我很抱歉
Tell Klaus I'm sorry.

270
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,814
我可不
I'm not.

271
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,669
（杜曼街）

272
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,131
我们早该察觉母亲与这事有关的
We should have felt
our mother's hand in this.

273
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,209
我们早该知道
We should have known
she would not be bound

274
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,107
死亡也无法阻止她的
by anything as obvious as death.

275
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,340
如今她控制了女巫
and now she has control
of the witches.

276
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,916
- 她们不会停手的
- 对
-They will never stop.
-No.

277
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:42,849
葛雷拉家族也不会善罢甘休的
Nor would I expect
the Guerrera Wolves to back down.

278
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,184
海莉和孩子是狼人中的皇室
Hayley and the child
are wolf royalty.

279
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:50,987
因此她们对佛朗西丝卡的统治
就是一种威胁
And as such, they are a threat
to Francesca's claim to leadership.

280
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:52,527
她们永远不会安全的
They will never be safe.

281
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,993
你之前对我怎么说的
What was it you said to me earlier,

282
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:01,764
我可悲的一生每天都在树敌？
that I've made enemies
every day of my miserable life?

283
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,966
最可怕的敌人就在我们身边，哥哥
Well, the worst of them
are within these borders, brother.

284
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,613
我为世界带来了一个可以对付我的武器
I have brought into the world
a weapon they can use against me.

285
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,976
那我们就武装好自己
ELlJAH: Then we will arm ourselves.

286
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,449
弟弟，我们已经和这里每一个对手
交手过，我们都赢了
Brother, we fought every adversary
in this town and we have won.

287
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,555
不论对手是谁
我们会再次和他们交手
We'll fight them again,
no matter who they are.

288
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,850
我们要把这个家变成坚实的堡垒
We'll make this home a fortress.

289
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,153
我不会让她过囚犯一样的生活
I will not have her live her life
as a prisoner.

290
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:26,820
那就离开这里，我们一起走
Then we leave here together,
all of us.

291
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:30,729
无论我们去哪
无论逃到多远
Wherever we go, however far we run,

292
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:35,862
那些追求权力和复仇的人会一直
追杀我们，也会追杀她
those who seek power and revenge
will hunt us. They will hunt her.

293
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,339
我们的敌人都成了她的敌人
她却没有我们的抵抗能力
She has inherited all our enemies
with none of our defenses.

294
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:43,174
所以不论我们是留下还是离开
她都备受威胁
So whether we stay or we leave,
we condemn her.

295
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,612
还有第三个选择
HAYLEY: There is a third option.

296
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,945
我在战争的环境中长大
I grew up in a war zone.

297
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,887
我父母以为他们能保护我
My parents thought
they could protect me.

298
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,391
但最终，他们被屠杀了
But in the end,
they were slaughtered,

299
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:01,658
我的童年孤独无依，没人疼爱
and I spent my childhood alone
and unloved.

300
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,968
我对宝宝也对自己发誓
I made a promise to my baby
and to myself.

301
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,243
她的童年不会像我一样
That she would not grow up
like I did.

302
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:20,145
她会在安全有爱的环境下长大
That she would grow up
safe and loved.

303
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
然而她来到这世上的第一天
And yet here she is
on her first day in this world

304
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:28,449
祖母就想将她献祭
with a grandmother
that is bent on sacrificing her.

305
00:30:28,626 --> 00:30:32,528
母亲则不得不喝她的血
And a mother that has to drink
the blood of her own baby

306
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,155
才能变成泥合种活下来
to survive transitioning
into a hybrid.

307
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,497
我是最爱她的人
And I'm the one
that loves her the most.

308
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:52,674
我想我们唯一能做的事
就是送走她
I think the only thing to do
is send her away

309
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,182
我们自己留下来
while we stay behind

310
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,684
收拾好我们制造的烂摊子
and clean up the mess
that we've made.

311
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,915
不，这太疯狂了
No. This is insane.

312
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,617
你听到洁妮薇说的话了
You heard Genevieve.

313
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,320
只要这孩子活着，她就会一直被追杀
So long as she lives,
that baby will be hunted.

314
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,628
如果没人知道她还活着呢？
What if no one knows she lives?

315
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,368
你想要干什么，弟弟？
What is it that you intend to do,
brother?

316
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:23,242
不惜一切代价
拯救我们的家人
Whatever it takes
to save our family.

317
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:27,949
今天是法语区全新的开始
Today begins a new day
in the quarter.

318
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,579
我长久以来居住在这里的家人
My family, long-time residents
of this great community,

319
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,622
许诺会帮助每一位市民
pledges to help every citizen

320
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,421
从昨晚在我们街头所爆发的
recover from the terrible outbreak
of gang violence

321
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,929
可怕的帮派暴力冲突中恢复过来
that erupted on the streets
of our city last night.

322
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,035
我们将重建城市
We will rebuild.

323
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,195
我们会记住那些逝去的人
We will remember those who perished

324
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,275
我们要努力消除这个城市里的毒瘤
as we seek to disinfect this town
of its worst elements.

325
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,808
我们会一起努力
We will work together

326
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:59,041
保证“新月城”纽奥良市
再次繁荣
to ensure the heart
of the Crescent City thrives again.

327
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,055
坚持到最后的人
Last man standing, huh?

328
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,460
我想做个交易
I'm interested in making a deal.

329
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,364
看起来你也没什么可给的
Don't look like
you got much to offer.

330
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:23,098
我听说葛雷拉家族想要让法语区
变成没有吸血鬼的地方
I'm hearing word that the Guerreras
want the quarter to be a no vampire zone.

331
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,263
我能做到这点
I can make that happen

332
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,934
交换是，你们不要再干涉
住在河对岸的我们
in exchange for you leaving us alone
across the river.

333
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:32,572
否则我会给你们的新狼群带来痛苦
Or I can unleash hell
on your new wolf pack.

334
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,186
- 你要怎么做？
- 简单
-And how can you do that?
-Easy.

335
00:32:37,355 --> 00:32:40,950
我和克劳斯讲和了
他治愈了我
I made my peace with Klaus.
He cured me.

336
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,288
现在是你们和我们对抗
So now it's you versus us.

337
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:49,161
克劳斯…
是个好战者
Klaus is a warmonger.

338
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,700
你觉得他会选择站在
You think he's gonna choose to side

339
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,566
一群瘦弱的吸血鬼那边
with a pack of scrawny vamps...

340
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:59,167
还是他创造的新狼族大军这边呢？
...or an army of the new wolf breed
that he created?

341
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,074
我想他会站在我们这边的
I'm thinking
he's gonna side with us.

342
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:06,444
尤其是当他发现
你们的族人杀死了他的孩子
Especially after he finds out
that your pack killed his kid.

343
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:09,952
什么？
What?

344
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,480
打开箱子
Open the box,

345
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,648
告诉我你觉得克劳斯会认为
and let me know
what you think Klaus will believe

346
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,351
谁该为箱子里的东西负责
about who's responsible
for what you find inside of it.

347
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:29,199
火化也许是最好的方式
趁克劳斯还没追查到你之前
Cremation may be the best way to go
before Klaus smells it on you.

348
00:33:56,334 --> 00:33:58,495
（我们想你）

349
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,637
（悼念米卡森宝宝）

350
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,505
克劳斯
CAMl: Klaus.

351
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,013
孩子？
The baby?

352
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,124
她死了
She died.

353
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:23,658
在葛雷拉发动攻击几小时之后
A few hours
after the Guerrera attack.

354
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,964
这…
这都是我的错
This is--
This is all my fault.

355
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,498
- 我向你保证，不是你的错
- 不
-I can assure you it is not.
-No.

356
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:32,932
如果我没有迟疑
If I hadn't hesitated,

357
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,299
我就能及时揭穿佛朗西丝卡的阴谋
阻止这一切
I could have uncovered
Francesca's plot in time to stop it.

358
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:39,273
那你要如何阻止女巫与她联手？
And how would you have stopped the
coven of witches in league with her?

359
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:41,843
不
No.

360
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:48,617
如果要怪谁，一定是我
If anyone is to blame, I am.

361
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:54,853
我真的很抱歉
I am so, so sorry.

362
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,523
卡蜜儿
Camille.

363
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:07,527
我感谢你能来这里
但我们不能成为朋友
I appreciate you being here,
but we cannot be friends.

364
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,230
什么？
What?

365
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,899
你一开始就说对了
You had me pegged from the start.

366
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,706
我被自己的恶魔摧毁了
那些恶魔还在纠缠不休
A man damaged by his demons,
and those demons are not dormant.

367
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:21,443
他们下定决心要杀死我
还有我眼里美好的一切
They are hell-bent on killing me
and everything I find beautiful.

368
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,786
而你
And you.

369
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,287
你那么美好
You are beautiful.

370
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,322
求求你
Please.

371
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,024
- 求你走吧
- 克劳斯
-Please just go.
-Klaus.

372
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,662
走吧
Go.

373
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,917
马赛尔的任务完成了吗？
Did Marcel play his part?

374
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:05,358
他在路易斯安那州北部的一家医院里
He managed
to locate a stillborn baby

375
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,430
找到了一个胎死腹中的孩子
in a hospital in upstate Louisiana.

376
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,463
我想他是接受我们的条件了
I trust he agreed to the terms.

377
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,625
他同意让我魅惑他
He has agreed
to allow me to compel him

378
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,101
忘记我孩子的事情
to forget what he knows of my child.

379
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,434
交换是，他要几小瓶我的血液
In exchange,
he wants vials of my blood.

380
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,042
必须让女巫相信才行
But the witches
will have to believe this.

381
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,703
第四名收获祭女孩很快就会复活
Soon that fourth harvest girl
will resurrect.

382
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,712
女巫又将复原
The coven will rebuild.

383
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,579
要是她们察觉你的孩子还活着
她们会追杀她的
If they sense that your child lives,
they will hunt her.

384
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,017
女巫们会相信我们说的话
The witches will buy what we sell.

385
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,153
只要我们能自圆其说
We just have to sell it properly.

386
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:49,305
那就只剩下道别了
Well, then all that remains
is to say goodbye.

387
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,316
他们会看着我们
所有人
KLAUS: They will be watching us,
all of them.

388
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:43,055
我们三人一起离开会引来许多注意
The three of us leaving together
will draw too much attention.

389
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,388
我会独自离开
I will go alone.

390
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:50,764
我走了之后，你们要参加公众追悼会
Take your mourning public
when I'm gone.

391
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,529
我想那不会太难的
I don't imagine
that will be too difficult.

392
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,574
毕竟，悲伤的情绪是真的
Grief, after all, is grief.

393
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:07,278
离开我们她要在哪才会安全，弟弟？
ELlJAH: In what world will she
be safe without us, brother?

394
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,078
谁能比我们提供更好的保护给她？
Who can protect her better than we?

395
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,752
有一个人能
KLAUS: There is one person.

396
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,034
你好，妹妹
Hello, sister.

397
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,404
她长得像她妈妈
Oh, she looks like her mother.

398
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:42,417
也许真的有上帝
Maybe there is a God after all.

399
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:48,382
她的眼里看得到些许恶魔的影子
Well, she has a hint of the devil
in her eyes.

400
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,718
那是遗传我的
That's all me.

401
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:59,095
你需要一个可以信赖的女巫
施个隐身咒
You'll need a witch you can trust
to cast a cloaking spell.

402
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,669
我会找到的
I'll get one.

403
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,306
- 不能让任何人发现她
- 我知道该怎么做，尼克
-No one can ever find her.
-I know what to do, Nik.

404
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:10,677
也许我们会建起白色的篱笆
我想那一定会很美
Perhaps we'll get a white fence.
I think that would be lovely.

405
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:26,359
这个城市以为你死了
This city would have seen you dead,

406
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,896
但我会把这里变成你的家
but I will have it your home.

407
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:35,767
每一个想要伤害你的人
都会被杀死
And every soul who wishes you harm
will be struck down.

408
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,274
只要你的血脉里还流着我的血
Just as sure
as my blood runs in your veins,

409
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,437
你就会回到我身边
you will return to me.

410
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,368
尽管我们之间有矛盾，蕾贝卡
In spite of our differences,
Rebekah,

411
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,407
但把女儿交给你，我最放心
there is no one I would trust more
with my daughter's life.

412
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:23,118
要幸福，妹妹
Be happy, sister.

413
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,455
她会幸福的，尼克，我保证
She will be happy, Nik. I promise.

414
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,753
她叫什么名字？
What's her name?

415
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,761
希望
Hope.

416
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,102
她叫希望
Her name is Hope.

417
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,880
愿你安息
MAN: May you rest in peace.

418
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,579
那有什么意思？
WOMAN: What's the fun in that?

419
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,026
来吧，我们有许多事要做
Come along. We have much to do.

420
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,659
是的，母亲
Yes mother.

421
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:52,032
（艾丝塔 我们敬爱的母亲）

422
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:57,938
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
