NARRATOR: <i>Kids,</i>
<i>in the spring of 2012,</i>

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:04,977
<i>your Uncle Barney went off</i>
<i>the grid for a couple weeks.</i>

3
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:07,015
<i>So I was relieved</i>
<i>when I got a text</i>

4
00:00:07,017 --> 00:00:08,684
<i>asking me to come over</i>
<i>to his place.</i>

5
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:10,319
Glad to hear from you, buddy.

6
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,238
I was worried something
bad happened...

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,357
...to you.

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,891
Welcome, brother.

9
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:18,243
What is this?

10
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:21,914
Ted Evelyn Mosby,

11
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:23,165
you are about to be
sworn to secrecy

12
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:26,251
through the sacred vows
of a Bro Oath,

13
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:28,537
or "Broath."

14
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,424
Please, put on
your "brobe."

15
00:00:32,426 --> 00:00:34,593
Yeah, I'm not putting on
the "brobe."

16
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:36,295
Ted, just...

17
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,747
just... Okay?

18
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:41,967
(Gregorian chant over stereo):
♪ Broooo... ♪

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,720
Wait, are they chanting "bro"?

20
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,087
♪ Bro... ♪

21
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:48,089
I got some local monks
to record this.

22
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,725
Yeah! I got a monk guy.

23
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:50,726
Cool, right?

24
00:00:50,728 --> 00:00:51,977
It actually is, yeah.

25
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,195
I'll burn it for you.

26
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:55,030
Just remind me after The Broath.

27
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:57,616
Anyway, Ted Evelyn Mosby,

28
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:02,937
this ritual forever binds you
to keep a solemn secret...

29
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:04,239
Which is?

30
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:05,874
I really like this Quinn girl!

31
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:07,993
We've been spending
tons of time together,

32
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:09,444
and I want the gang to meet her.

33
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,213
but I'm afraid they're
gonna disapprove because,

34
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:14,633
well, you know.
NARRATOR: <i>I did know. You see,</i>

35
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:16,268
<i>Quinn was a stripper...</i>

36
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,338
<i>who had swindled Barney out of</i>
<i>quite a bit of cash.</i>

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,256
We're inviting everyone
to dinner at Quinn's,

38
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:22,975
and I want them to
keep an open mind,

39
00:01:22,977 --> 00:01:24,459
which brings us to The Broath.

40
00:01:24,461 --> 00:01:27,596
Place your hand
on The Bro Code.

41
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:29,314
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

42
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:31,466
Repeat after me.

43
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:35,187
I, Ted Evelyn Mosby...

44
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,441
"I, Ted "Why Did I Ever Tell You
My Middle Name" Mosby..."

45
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:42,077
...solemnly swear not to
tell our friends

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,478
that Quinn is
a stripper.

47
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
"...solemnly swear not
to tell our friends

48
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:48,533
that Quinn is a stripper" who
duped you out of lots of money.

49
00:01:48,535 --> 00:01:50,118
You're only supposed
to repeat after me.

50
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,620
"You're only supposed
to repeat after me."

51
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:52,621
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

52
00:01:52,623 --> 00:01:54,956
Silence!

53
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,926
Look, I know that things
started out sketchy

54
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:00,262
with me and Quinn, but
I really like her, so please.

55
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,163
Do you,

56
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,435
Ted Middle-Name-Omitted Mosby,

57
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:09,688
swear to uphold this Broath?

58
00:02:10,273 --> 00:02:11,907
I do.

59
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:14,943
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

60
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:18,945
Original Air Date on March 19, 2012

61
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:22,966

62
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:29,775
Okay, time to go to
Quinn's. Now remember,

63
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,326
I told you nothing, okay?

64
00:02:31,328 --> 00:02:33,061
Barney really wants
us all to like her.

65
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,446
But how can we?

66
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:37,032
Quinn totally duped Barney,
and he couldn't even see it.

67
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,401
Well, apparently, the sex
is mind-blowing.

68
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:42,237
Ha, I've been there.
Yeah.

69
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,872
I was once with this chick

70
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:46,708
who answered the door wearing
nothing but, uh, whipped cream,

71
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,077
a dog collar
and a hot pink thong.

72
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,295
LILY: Marshall,

73
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:52,080
you can't tell sex stories

74
00:02:52,082 --> 00:02:53,465
about "this chick," because

75
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,949
everyone knows it's me.

76
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:56,784
I'm the only woman
you've ever been with.

77
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:59,621
It's not fair, the guys are
always telling their sex stories

78
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:01,223
and I can top
every one of them.

79
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,426
Baby, you're like 20 slutty
chicks all rolled into one.

80
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:06,678
Sweet talk is not going
to change my mind.

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,963
Let's focus.

82
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,315
Tonight, we want to make sure

83
00:03:10,317 --> 00:03:12,567
that Quinn is not
out to scam Barney.

84
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:14,653
So, when we walk back
through that door

85
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:17,022
three hours from now,
we should all be able

86
00:03:17,024 --> 00:03:19,241
to answer one
simple question:

87
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:23,411
Do we trust this girl?

88
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:24,613
Well, for one thing,

89
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:26,498
she seems kind of controlling.

90
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,651
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

91
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,036
No, save it for dessert.

92
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,454
Idiot.

93
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:34,339
(all laughing)

94
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:36,374
(snaps fingers)
(chuckles) Uh, ah...

95
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,460
More red wine, beauty-swan?

96
00:03:38,462 --> 00:03:40,995
She drinks a lot.

97
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,598
Is it okay if I
go pee, sugar lamb?

98
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,666
No!

99
00:03:44,668 --> 00:03:46,334
You just went three hours ago.

100
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:48,303
You're right, baby bear!

101
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,107
(moans)

102
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:54,476
Yes, so Barney's whipped;
it doesn't mean

103
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,561
that Quinn is a con artist.

104
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:59,013
Well, maybe we could've gotten
a better read on her

105
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,700
if two people
hadn't gone off topic.

106
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:04,236
By the way, Quinn,
your apartment is amazing.

107
00:04:04,238 --> 00:04:05,853
Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.

108
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:08,123
I'm actually moving out soon.

109
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,908
If you know anyone
looking for a sublet,

110
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,876
this place is rent-controlled.

111
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,544
You would not believe
what I pay.

112
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:14,362
NARRATOR: <i>Kids,</i>
<i>things have been tense</i>

113
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:15,997
<i>between Robin and I for weeks.</i>

114
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,716
<i>Ever since she moved out,</i>

115
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:20,302
<i>and I gave the apartment</i>
<i>to Marshall and Lily,</i>

116
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,888
<i>I'd been crashing</i>
<i>in university housing.</i>

117
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,056
It's 10:00,
damn it.

118
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:26,541
Ned, Martin and Millie,

119
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:28,209
people are trying to sleep!

120
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:31,313
Hey, you were young
like us once, right?

121
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:34,683
I was never like you guys.

122
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,903
NARRATOR: <i>And Robin was staying</i>
<i>with her coworker, Patrice.</i>

123
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:39,654
You seem so down today, Robin.

124
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,106
I made you cookies.

125
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,725
Damn it, Patrice,
stop smothering me!

126
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:47,412
NARRATOR: <i>So, when Quinn said</i>
<i>her apartment was available...</i>

127
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,699
ROBIN/TED:
It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!

128
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,833
Dibs! Dibs! Dibs!

129
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:54,836
We got off topic?
What about Marshall?

130
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:56,538
Hey, I was just
going along with

131
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,757
whoever suggested
we play that game.

132
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,041
Hey, let's play a game!

133
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:02,627
Uh, craziest
sex-in-public story; I'll start.

134
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:04,429
I was once with this chick

135
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:06,848
who loved to get freaky
in elevators.

136
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,249
Doors would close;
suddenly,

137
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:11,469
she's panting on all fours
like a dog in heat.

138
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:12,704
(panting)

139
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,557
Marshall, stop.

140
00:05:15,559 --> 00:05:17,142
I never said that it was you.

141
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:19,144
Okay, so anyway, last August,

142
00:05:19,146 --> 00:05:21,363
I go bareback
with this same slut.

143
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:24,316
She get's pregnant;
bitch is even hornier.

144
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,101
Oh, yeah? I was once
with this dude

145
00:05:27,103 --> 00:05:29,237
who I caught eating
a sandwich during sex.

146
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:30,705
Big ol' meatball

147
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,707
falls out, lands on my back,

148
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,942
rolls on to the elevator floor.

149
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:37,111
Hmm. Disgusting, right?

150
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,882
What, I never said it was you.

151
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:44,085
Yeah, sorry we didn't stay
as laser-focused as you guys.

152
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:46,454
Hey, at least I got
some evidence.

153
00:05:46,456 --> 00:05:49,057
Look what I found
in Quinn's bedroom.

154
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,976
Barney's taking her to Hawaii.

155
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:52,894
Lily, you snooped
through her stuff?

156
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:55,180
No. It's like
the first thing you see

157
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:57,899
when you jimmy open her desk
drawer with a letter opener

158
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,635
her grandfather left her,
according to her diary.

159
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:02,070
ROBIN: First-class tickets,

160
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:04,439
a four-star hotel--
this cost Barney a fortune.

161
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:08,142
Yeah, this proves that Quinn is
totally using him for his money.

162
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:09,644
You know what Lily, enough.

163
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:12,146
Guys, even if you're right
about Quinn, this is Barney.

164
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:13,281
He'll come to his senses.

165
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:15,784
I give this whole thing
a week, two weeks, tops.

166
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:18,169
And now, we have
an announcement.

167
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:18,953
Can I tell them?

168
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,622
No.

169
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:21,790
We're moving in together
We're m...

170
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:25,510
Congrats! That's great.
So happy for you.

171
00:06:25,512 --> 00:06:27,161
We gotta end this.

172
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:29,197
All: Yup.

173
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:31,725
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

174
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:34,582
<i>our gang had a subtle way</i>
<i>of letting someone know</i>

175
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,367
<i>they were making a mistake.</i>

176
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,172
Where have you been?

177
00:06:39,459 --> 00:06:41,543
Oh, worth it. Hang on.

178
00:06:41,545 --> 00:06:43,662
Hey.

179
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,287
You know we would've
hated ourselves, right?

180
00:06:53,973 --> 00:06:55,623
So,

181
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,593
did Robin tell you the incredibly
devious thing she did today?

182
00:06:58,595 --> 00:06:59,778
Me?!

183
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,148
Hey, so I just happened
to be in the neighborhood

184
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,934
and I thought, "Man, Quinn
is in such great shape,

185
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,802
she must love fruit."

186
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:08,687
(chuckles)

187
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,488
So, unrelated,

188
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,240
how's the search for
a sub-letter going?

189
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:15,744
This is such a
weird coincidence!

190
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,029
Robin also "just happened"
to be in the neighborhood

191
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:21,816
with a bottle of wine
and her credit scores.

192
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,501
(cork pops)

193
00:07:27,924 --> 00:07:29,541
I can't believe you two.

194
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,843
What do you care about more,
protecting your friend

195
00:07:31,845 --> 00:07:34,629
from getting hurt or scoring
this girl's apartment?

196
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:36,214
There's a working fireplace!

197
00:07:36,216 --> 00:07:38,967
Patrice is ironing
my pants all wrong!

198
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:40,802
You guys should be ashamed.

199
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:42,604
Speaking of shame,

200
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:45,173
I was once with this chick
who liked to do hand stuff

201
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,891
underneath a jacket
while we were all

202
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:48,693
sitting around our
favorite booth at MacLaren's.

203
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,861
Gross.

204
00:07:49,863 --> 00:07:51,696
We share appetizers.

205
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:54,449
Okay, well, I was once
with a dude

206
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,018
who couldn't even fantasize
about a three-way.

207
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,321
He was all,
"Ew, she's your best friend."

208
00:07:59,323 --> 00:08:00,288
What now?

209
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,706
I was once with a
chick who wanted

210
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,793
to get it on during a school
production of <i>Peter</i> <i>Pan.</i>

211
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:06,845
Well, I...
Wait, that wasn't me.

212
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,131
So, back to Patrice
and this ironing issue...

213
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:12,834
I thought I was the first girl
you ever did anything with.

214
00:08:12,836 --> 00:08:14,252
Anything serious.

215
00:08:14,254 --> 00:08:15,804
Please don't tell me that
you're jealous of me getting

216
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:19,057
to second base in tenth grade
with Jenna Cristalli.

217
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:22,344
Don't say that whore's name
in front of our baby.

218
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:24,729
What's going on?

219
00:08:25,931 --> 00:08:28,566
Barney, this in an intervention.

220
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,551
(clears throat)

221
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,387
A "Quinntervention."

222
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,557
You and Quinn are moving really
fast, and we don't trust her.

223
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,593
We're just looking out
for your best interests.

224
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:41,496
(clears throat)

225
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:44,099
"Quinn-terests."

226
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:46,334
I don't understand. Wh...

227
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,086
Wait a sec.

228
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,505
Ted Evelyn Mosby...

229
00:08:50,507 --> 00:08:53,124
you broke The Broath.

230
00:08:53,126 --> 00:08:54,709
How dare you?!

231
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:59,047
A Broath is the most sacred bond
between-- okay, yeah, I did.

232
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:01,916
Are you aware that
breaking a Broath

233
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:05,720
can have deadly,
even fatal repercussions?

234
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,756
Have you studied history, Ted?

235
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,424
Extensively.
But I'm a little shaky

236
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,758
on fake history, so...

237
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,640
The tragic cost of
a broken Broath

238
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:13,279
Uh-huh.

239
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,115
dates back to
Ancient Bro-man times...

240
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:21,036
Hey, Bro-tus,

241
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:23,455
you'd tell me if,
like, a bunch of dudes

242
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:25,874
were conspiring to
assassinate me, right?

243
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:29,294
Um, totally, Caesar.

244
00:09:29,296 --> 00:09:31,713
Paranoid much?
(wry chuckle)

245
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:33,948
Just to be sure,

246
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,301
can you swear
a Broath to me?

247
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,586
Sure. I swear.

248
00:09:38,588 --> 00:09:40,955
Thanks.

249
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:43,174
You've always got my back.

250
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,342
(clicks tongue)

251
00:09:44,344 --> 00:09:47,779
(whistling)

252
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:49,981
(ninjas grunting)

253
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:54,135
(grunting)

254
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,781
<i>Et tu, Bro-te?</i>

255
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:07,815
(grunts)

256
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,501
(gasps and groans)

257
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:13,671
And then he banged,
like, a hundred chicks

258
00:10:13,673 --> 00:10:15,840
and invented a salad.

259
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:17,325
True story.

260
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,428
Well, Quinn lied to you;
she manipulated you.

261
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,097
What if she's just using you?

262
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,515
She's not just using me.

263
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:25,333
What about the expensive
trip to Hawaii?

264
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:27,936
What expensive trip to Hawaii?

265
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,271
The one I got for you.

266
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,358
That was supposed to be
a surprise for Barney.

267
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,810
He asked me to meet him here.

268
00:10:35,812 --> 00:10:38,179
What's going on, you guys?

269
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:40,031
Tell her.

270
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:43,351
(scoffs) Fine,
I'll fill her in.

271
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,487
And I am so angry,

272
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:48,656
I'm not even gonna make a joke
about "filling her in."

273
00:10:48,658 --> 00:10:51,042
Which I did three times
last night, self-five.

274
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:53,711
My friends think
you're wrong for me,

275
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,663
so they're having
an intervention.

276
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:58,216
(clears throat)

277
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:00,668
A "Quinntervention."

278
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,337
I don't understand.

279
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,089
Well, see, your name
is Quinn, and so...

280
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:06,758
I'll explain.

281
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,979
I made Ted promise not to tell
them what you do, but he did,

282
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:12,680
and now they don't trust you.

283
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:16,184
Wow, that really hurts.

284
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:17,368
But what's even worse

285
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,555
is that you felt
the need to lie about me.

286
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,857
I'm not ashamed of
who I am, Barney,

287
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,892
but you clearly are.

288
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:26,077
I'm not ashamed of you.

289
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,329
I just didn't want them
to judge you without...

290
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:30,165
Maybe we are moving too fast.

291
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,233
What? What is that
supposed to mean?

292
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:34,202
I don't think I can do this.

293
00:11:34,204 --> 00:11:37,589
Wait, are you ending things
just like that?

294
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:40,875
If you walk out that door,
you prove them right.

295
00:11:40,877 --> 00:11:42,760
You prove that you're just
some heartless stripper

296
00:11:42,762 --> 00:11:45,029
who never gave a damn about me
in the...

297
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,584
Don't call me.

298
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,053
(door slams)

299
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:56,090
Wow. That
was intense.

300
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,259
(clears throat)

301
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:04,350
We just destroyed
what could have been

302
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:07,203
a once-in-a-lifetime shot
at happiness.

303
00:12:07,205 --> 00:12:09,505
I know. I feel guilty, too.

304
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,041
Fireplace, balcony,

305
00:12:12,043 --> 00:12:13,576
hardwood floors...

306
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:15,511
Okay, I'll just say it:

307
00:12:15,513 --> 00:12:17,113
After everything that
happened between us,

308
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:18,164
I can't believe
you wouldn't

309
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,616
back down and let me
have Quinn's place.

310
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:23,619
Ted, can I talk to you
out in the hall?

311
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:28,007
Has it ever occurred to you

312
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:30,960
that the last few weeks haven't
been easy for me either?

313
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:34,597
In the span of one day,
my engagement fell apart,

314
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,350
I lost my best friend,
then I lost my apartment.

315
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:39,652
And-and now I'm about
to lose my job.

316
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:40,686
What do you mean?

317
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:41,837
(sighs)

318
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,991
I-I've been completely
distracted at work.

319
00:12:44,993 --> 00:12:48,394
And now my boss wants to see me
Friday at 5:00,

320
00:12:48,396 --> 00:12:51,614
which, around the office,
is known as "fire o'clock."

321
00:12:51,616 --> 00:12:53,399
I had no idea.

322
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:54,667
How could you?

323
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,987
The one person I want to talk
to most barely looks me

324
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:00,590
in the eye anymore,
much less returns my calls.

325
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:04,043
Ted, I know it took guts
to tell me you love me.

326
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,863
And I-I know how much it hurt
that I didn't say it back,

327
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,465
but...

328
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:13,402
Damn it, th-this sucks
for me, too.

329
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:16,138
And I-I miss you.

330
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,545
Is there any way we can just...
go back to normal?

331
00:13:22,547 --> 00:13:27,984
I don't think
I can do normal anymore.

332
00:13:27,986 --> 00:13:29,719
(door opens)

333
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:33,356
Barney still
isn't answering.

334
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:36,225
We gotta go find him
and apologize.

335
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,894
(knocking, door opens)

336
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:42,415
Oh. I thought you were Quinn.

337
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,667
Barney, we're so sorry.

338
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:46,735
We never should've
meddled like that.

339
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:48,504
Can you forgive us?
I don't know.

340
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,289
You had no right to do that.

341
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,091
How can we make it
up to you, buddy?

342
00:13:52,093 --> 00:13:54,126
(Gregorian chant playing)

343
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:57,880
I, one of Barney's
best friends...

344
00:13:57,882 --> 00:14:00,716
OTHERS: "I, one of Barney's
best friends..."

345
00:14:00,718 --> 00:14:04,470
...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again...

346
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:08,708
"...promise never to interfere
with his personal life again..."

347
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,311
...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

348
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,113
or he's about to get up
on a fattie.

349
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:18,600
"...unless it's an issue of
health, national security,

350
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:21,603
or he's about to
get up on a fattie."

351
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:25,992
And now, to seal
this sacred vow,

352
00:14:25,994 --> 00:14:27,793
the two ladies will kiss.
Barney...

353
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,612
The two ladies will kiss!

354
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,885
Mmm.

355
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,454
Lil...
(chuckling)

356
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,006
Okay.

357
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:41,290
And now the gentlemen.

358
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:42,558
Dude...

359
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,927
And now the gentlemen!

360
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:49,315
Let's just...
This is silly.

361
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:53,569
Don't-don't touch
my face.

362
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,474
I was going to say,

363
00:14:58,476 --> 00:15:00,142
"And now the gentlemen
bump fists."

364
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,944
How long you been holding
back that one?

365
00:15:01,946 --> 00:15:05,197
QUINN: Hot stuff, fellas.

366
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,233
Did I see a little tongue
in there?

367
00:15:08,118 --> 00:15:09,835
I don't understand.

368
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,087
Well, if these two

369
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,172
will keep their sweaty paws
off each other

370
00:15:13,174 --> 00:15:14,423
for half a second, I'll explain.

371
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,325
It all started
a couple days ago...

372
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,993
I want you to meet
my friends.

373
00:15:17,995 --> 00:15:19,595
Should I be nervous?

374
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:21,514
Is it like bringing me home
to meet your parents?

375
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:22,631
No, no, no.

376
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,166
Much more stressful than that.

377
00:15:24,168 --> 00:15:26,602
You see, my friends, while
awesome, can be presumptuous,

378
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:28,938
meddlesome and
downright destructive.

379
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,357
When they learn what
you do and how we met,

380
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:32,808
they'll probably try
to break us up.

381
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,027
So let's have
some fun with them.

382
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:36,512
Mess with their heads.

383
00:15:36,514 --> 00:15:39,648
Are you saying...
evil plan?

384
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,283
Hells to the yes.

385
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:43,486
My God, you're hot.

386
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:44,520
Wait for it.

387
00:15:44,522 --> 00:15:46,205
Here's what we do.

388
00:15:46,207 --> 00:15:49,542
BARNEY: <i>I'll make Ted swear not to tell</i>
<i>anyone what he knows about you,</i>

389
00:15:49,544 --> 00:15:51,193
<i>and he'll cave immediately.</i>

390
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:53,279
Barney's dating a stripper
who's gonna steal all his money!

391
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,280
<i>Next, we invite everyone over.</i>

392
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:55,915
<i>I'll keep saying stuff like:</i>

393
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,883
Is it okay if I put out
the hummus, bunny face?

394
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,385
QUINN: <i>And I'll be the bossy</i>
<i>bitch who says:</i>

395
00:15:59,387 --> 00:16:01,921
No, save it for dessert, idiot.

396
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:03,205
BARNEY: <i>Nice.</i>

397
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:04,590
<i>And, finally, we'll announce...</i>

398
00:16:04,592 --> 00:16:06,158
We're moving in together!

399
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,510
I've got an idea.

400
00:16:07,512 --> 00:16:09,178
Let's get your friends
Ted and Robin

401
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,479
fighting over my apartment.

402
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,548
Wait, what does that have
to do with you and me?

403
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,066
Nothing. I just
worship chaos.

404
00:16:14,068 --> 00:16:15,901
I can't handle how hot
you are right now.

405
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:18,104
Wait for it.
Next,

406
00:16:18,106 --> 00:16:20,773
BARNEY: <i>they'll try to talk me</i>
<i>into dumping you.</i>

407
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,057
QUINN: <i>And I'll walk in on it.</i>

408
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:22,992
BARNEY:
<i>Then we pretend to break up.</i>

409
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:24,610
<i>And when they crawl back,</i>

410
00:16:24,612 --> 00:16:25,978
<i>begging for forgiveness...</i>

411
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,114
<i>I'll be the bigger man</i>
<i>and let them off the hook.</i>

412
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,583
QUINN: <i>Or make the monkeys</i>
<i>dance for you.</i>

413
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:32,535
BARNEY: <i>God, you're smart!</i>

414
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:35,004
It's gonna be legen...

415
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:37,790
I'm not waiting for
it anymore. Mmm...

416
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:39,942
...dary.

417
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:43,579
My God, you two are...

418
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:45,097
Perfect together.

419
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:47,049
So you're not really moving in?

420
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:48,601
Well, it started
out as a joke,

421
00:16:48,603 --> 00:16:50,386
but the more we
talked about it...

422
00:16:50,388 --> 00:16:51,937
The more excited we got.

423
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,256
So, yeah, we are.

424
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:57,359
You have anything
to say about that?

425
00:16:57,361 --> 00:17:00,279
So happy for you.
Congratulations.

426
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:03,365
Thank you.

427
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:04,867
Thank you.

428
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:07,736
You two realize this means

429
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:10,055
my apartment really is
up for grabs, right?

430
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,409
I'm sure I'll find
something else.

431
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,077
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

432
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,714
NARRATOR: <i>And that's the story</i>
<i>of how we met Quinn.</i>

433
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:22,718
TED: <i>That Friday, I met Robin to see</i>
<i>how it went at "fire o'clock."</i>

434
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,954
They promoted me
to on-air talent.

435
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:27,956
I'm gonna be
Sandy Rivers' new co-host.

436
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:29,291
Oh, my God!

437
00:17:29,293 --> 00:17:30,459
How'd that happen?

438
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:31,510
Remember New Year's Eve?

439
00:17:31,512 --> 00:17:33,962
<i>When I filled in for Sandy,</i>
<i>it turns out</i>

440
00:17:33,964 --> 00:17:36,298
the C.E.O.
of <i>World Wide News</i> liked me.

441
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,799
He said I have "moxie."

442
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:39,602
So he's a 1940s gangster?

443
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:40,969
(laughing): Apparently.

444
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:43,805
And I got a big raise,

445
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:47,243
so I'm taking this apartment
on Central Park West,

446
00:17:47,245 --> 00:17:48,327
which means...

447
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,695
Quinn's apartment.

448
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:51,096
I already told her
you'd take it.

449
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,667
Wow. Thanks.

450
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:55,668
Yeah.

451
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,985
Hey, and congrats.

452
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:58,737
You deserve it all.

453
00:17:59,823 --> 00:18:04,326
You know, I've been
thinking about it, and...

454
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:05,844
I can do normal.

455
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,880
To back to normal.

456
00:18:07,882 --> 00:18:08,714
To back to normal.

457
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:09,882
(clink)

458
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,676
Uh... I-I should get going.
Yeah.

459
00:18:20,678 --> 00:18:22,111
You've got a lot to do.
Totally.

460
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,512
So...
Um, see you soon.

461
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:24,346
See you soon.

462
00:18:24,348 --> 00:18:25,847
Yeah.

463
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:28,150
NARRATOR: <i>We wouldn't see each other</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

464
00:18:28,152 --> 00:18:31,186
<i>But I'll get to that.</i>

465
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:32,988
Listen, um...

466
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,691
about me getting to second base
in tenth grade

467
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,025
with Jenna Cristalli...

468
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:38,544
I don't know what you're
talking about.

469
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:41,046
I've already forgotten
about that dumb hobag.

470
00:18:41,048 --> 00:18:44,866
Yeah, um, it didn't happen while
we were watching <i>Peter Pan.</i>

471
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:48,870
It happened while I was
playing Peter Pan.

472
00:18:48,872 --> 00:18:52,141
Here's a photo
from the day I was cast.

473
00:18:52,143 --> 00:18:54,376
That's me in the middle.

474
00:18:54,378 --> 00:18:56,378
But then I had my growth spurt.

475
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,732
By opening night, I was too big
for the flying harness,

476
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,900
and, well...

477
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:08,357
I fell hands-first
right onto Jenna Cristalli.

478
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,443
The tissues in her bra saved me
two broken wrists.

479
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:12,861
I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted

480
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:15,331
to have one cool
sex story that wasn't you.

481
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,617
Okay. Next time you tell it,
you were in your dad's car,

482
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,754
which you stole to go
to a Metallica concert,

483
00:19:21,756 --> 00:19:25,924
and you got to third base
with that slut.

484
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,546
I was once with this chick...

485
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:34,333
who is just
the best wife ever.

486
00:19:37,804 --> 00:19:40,105
Thank you for being so cool
about what I do.

487
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:42,141
A lot of guys would be
weird or jealous.

488
00:19:42,143 --> 00:19:43,275
Are you kidding?

489
00:19:43,277 --> 00:19:45,594
Who am I to judge
anyone? I'm the devil!

490
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:51,116
I mean, if you ever

491
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:53,101
wanted to stop stripping,
I'd support it.

492
00:19:53,103 --> 00:19:55,571
- If you wanted... to.
- Uh-huh.

493
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:57,706
So, you are jealous?

494
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,792
What? No, no, not at all.

495
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,794
I'm just saying,
if you ever wanted to hang up

496
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:04,496
the ol' G-string,
I'd completely understand.

497
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:07,383
Nah, I like taking my clothes
off for money.

498
00:20:07,385 --> 00:20:08,417
Great.

499
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:10,836
Let me... let me finish.

500
00:20:10,838 --> 00:20:15,457
Hypothetically,
what would make you stop?

501
00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:17,726
Hypothetically...

502
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:22,798
I would stop stripping
if I ever got married.

503
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,066
Good night.

504
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:31,860
And then we agreed
to "go back to normal."

505
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,910
But I'm starting to wonder if we
can ever really just be friends.

506
00:20:38,912 --> 00:20:44,332
Anyway, that's the story of me
and Robin, 2005 to the present.

507
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,667
What do you think?

508
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,786
I think your stories
are way too long.

509
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,223
I feel bad
for his future kids, dude.

510
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:57,228
Hey, my kids are gonna
love my stories.

511
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:01,149
They're gonna... yeah, they're
gonna love my stories.

512
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:05,174
