1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,345
My siblings and I are the
first vampires in history...

2
00:00:04,362 --> 00:00:05,787
the Originals.

3
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:10,010
300 years ago, we helped
build the city of New Orleans.

4
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:14,314
We were happy here, a family.

5
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:17,517
Recently, a coven of witches
lured my brother back,

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,486
using his unborn child as leverage.

7
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:23,355
I tried to help him, but he
betrayed me to his enemy...

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,257
the vampire Marcel.

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:28,760
Since then, I have been held
prisoner by a powerful witch.

10
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:34,426
My brother seeks to manipulate
others to procure my release,

11
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,495
but I have my own plan.

12
00:00:36,497 --> 00:00:38,864
If this witch proves to be an enemy,

13
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:42,233
I will stop her by
whatever means necessary.

14
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:59,149
You're the one they call honorable.

15
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:09,960
Yes.

16
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,594
That's what they call me,

17
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:15,097
and yet I followed my brother here

18
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,900
to New Orleans to engage in a war.

19
00:01:17,902 --> 00:01:21,406
So I ask you,

20
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:27,976
does that sound honorable to you?

21
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,645
You don't look well.

22
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,480
Well, only this morning,
I had a mystical dagger

23
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,215
embedded in my chest.

24
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:37,618
So I'd say I'm holding
myself together quite well.

25
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,757
Davina, I believe that
you and I have the power

26
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,724
to end a war between witches and vampires

27
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:46,260
before it truly begins,

28
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,262
I by keeping my brother in line,

29
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:50,664
you by behaving as your true self,

30
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:54,634
not some tool for Marcel or the witches.

31
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:58,238
And why should I trust you?

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,840
Well, for one thing, in
spite of a ravenous hunger,

33
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:03,009
I have not tried to take your blood.

34
00:02:03,011 --> 00:02:06,745
Why not? I'm the only one here.

35
00:02:06,747 --> 00:02:07,847
Even in my present condition,

36
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:11,985
I would not feed... from a child.

37
00:03:26,756 --> 00:03:29,057
We had a deal.

38
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,291
You protect my unborn child,

39
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,760
I dismantle Marcel's army,

40
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:33,227
and whilst I've been busy

41
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:35,063
fulfilling my part of the bargain,

42
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:36,931
you allowed Hayley to be attacked

43
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:38,365
and almost killed by a gaggle

44
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,833
of lunatic witches.

45
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:42,069
I had nothing to do with it, I swear.

46
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,137
Hayley and I are linked, remember?

47
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,906
She dies, I die.

48
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,140
Then who were they?

49
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:49,242
They're a faction of extremists.

50
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:51,278
Sabine stupidly told them about some vision

51
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,712
she had about the baby.

52
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:53,846
What kind of vision?

53
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,247
She has them all the time.

54
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,983
They're totally open to interpretation.

55
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:58,350
I'm guessing she's wrong on this one.

56
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,919
Well, how, may I ask,

57
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,289
was this particular vision interpreted?

58
00:04:03,291 --> 00:04:05,357
Pretty much that your baby

59
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,226
would bring death to all witches.

60
00:04:07,228 --> 00:04:11,063
Ah, well, I grow fonder of
this child by the second.

61
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,297
Sophie, look.

62
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:14,399
I promised Elijah that I would protect

63
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,068
the Mikaelson miracle baby

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,904
whilst he tries to win
your witch Davina's loyalty.

65
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:22,040
Why don't you tell me just
how extreme this faction is?

66
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:24,374
Elijah is talking to Davina?

67
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:27,211
Yeah, as we speak, I imagine.

68
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:31,148
I'm guessing she'll have
plenty to say about that crowd.

69
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,351
Do tell.

70
00:04:34,353 --> 00:04:38,288
I wasn't always an
advocate for the witches.

71
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:46,096
Drink up, everybody!

72
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:48,698
This is how they party in Rio!

73
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,969
My sister was devoted like our parents,

74
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:55,138
and our upbringing was very strict,

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,006
which drove me nuts.

76
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,941
The minute I turned 21, I left the quarter

77
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:04,212
to travel and play, but
I wanted to be a chef.

78
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:07,282
So I came back to Rousseau's.

79
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,154
Yeah! 

80
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:18,226
Oh, Jane-Anne. Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

81
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:21,663
That wasn't me. Hi!

82
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,966
Welcome home, Soph.

83
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:27,234
Can we go someplace to talk?

84
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,969
Just tell me.

85
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:30,771
The elders called a vote.

86
00:05:30,773 --> 00:05:33,073
We're moving forward with the harvest.

87
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,941
What?

88
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,710
What the bloody hell is the harvest?

89
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,279
It's a ritual our coven
does every 3 centuries

90
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:42,149
so that the bond to our
ancestral magic is restored.

91
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,783
We appease our ancestors.

92
00:05:43,785 --> 00:05:45,885
They keep our ancestral power flowing.

93
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,553
And why haven't I heard of this?

94
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,056
Because the harvest
always seemed like a myth,

95
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,257
a story passed down through generations

96
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,392
like Noah's ark

97
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:56,122
or the Buddha walking on water,

98
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,657
the kind some people take literally

99
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,758
and some people don't.

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,895
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

101
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,831
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

102
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:10,201
To be reborn, we must have faith.

103
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,805
To be reborn, we must have faith.

104
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,174
Do you have faith in the harvest?

105
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,609
Not for a second.

106
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:21,745
Sophie.

107
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:23,346
What are you doing?

108
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:25,582
Saving the community you renounced.

109
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,551
You're all ridiculous.

110
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,786
Monique? Seriously?

111
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:31,788
My mom told me I had to.

112
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,659
Yeah. Well, you mom and
I are gonna have words.

113
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,397
They had the girls of our community

114
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:43,199
preparing for months.

115
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,634
4 would be chosen for the harvest.

116
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,403
They said that it was an honor,

117
00:06:47,405 --> 00:06:48,671
that they were special.

118
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:50,673
I thought it was a myth.

119
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,174
Was it?

120
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:00,982
Marcel, bit early in the
day for you, isn't it?

121
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:02,917
I know. I make this look easy,

122
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,985
but I still have an empire to run.

123
00:07:04,987 --> 00:07:06,387
Rather you than me.

124
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:08,823
All that responsibility
seems like such a bore.

125
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,391
Well, this might spice things up.

126
00:07:10,393 --> 00:07:11,593
I just heard about a bunch

127
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,260
of dead witches out in the bayou

128
00:07:13,262 --> 00:07:15,028
the kind of damage a werewolf might do,

129
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,697
only there was no full moon.

130
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,332
I have an informant out
there I need to meet,

131
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:20,334
and I would love for you to go with me.

132
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:22,402
Dead witches in the bayou.

133
00:07:22,404 --> 00:07:23,770
Sounds like less of a problem

134
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:25,672
and more like a cause for celebration.

135
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:27,140
Well, something killed them

136
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,908
and may still be out there,

137
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,376
and with your blood the only cure

138
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,670
for a werewolf bite, I would love

139
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,079
for you to accompany me.

140
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:35,481
Well, why not?

141
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,650
I haven't been to the bayou in ages.

142
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,984
I'm on my way.

143
00:07:38,986 --> 00:07:40,453
Peace out, brother.

144
00:07:41,822 --> 00:07:43,322
This is the one.

145
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,724
You can't go out there now.

146
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:45,990
I need to gather the witches' remains

147
00:07:45,992 --> 00:07:47,359
and consecrate them.

148
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,693
If I don't get to them before sundown,

149
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:50,395
we lose the link to their magic.

150
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:53,231
Those witches tried to kill Hayley.

151
00:07:53,233 --> 00:07:55,300
I prefer for Marcel's
informant not to find anything

152
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:57,034
that would lead him back to us,

153
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:58,970
to her, or to, you know, that.

154
00:07:58,972 --> 00:08:01,572
You are all class.

155
00:08:01,574 --> 00:08:05,476
Stay put and save the rest
of your story till I return.

156
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,883
Look who's back.

157
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:15,352
Here to visit your prisoner in the attic?

158
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:17,654
Lay off. She's not a prisoner,

159
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,121
and I'm moving her tonight.

160
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,056
Too many people know where she is.

161
00:08:21,058 --> 00:08:22,659
I have been hearing about
what you've been up to

162
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,160
since I've been out of town.

163
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,862
Using that girl to keep the
witches from doing magic?

164
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,532
All respect, Father K.,
if you're gonna defend

165
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:31,100
the witches' rights,

166
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:33,535
we got nothing to talk about.

167
00:08:42,312 --> 00:08:44,713
Do you play?

168
00:08:44,715 --> 00:08:47,482
That's... not mine.

169
00:08:58,827 --> 00:09:00,561
Good news, little D.

170
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:02,162
I'm moving you out of this pile of dust.

171
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:03,531
Are you serious? When?

172
00:09:03,533 --> 00:09:04,765
Tonight.

173
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,766
I just need to lock in the arrangements.

174
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,535
How's our Original?

175
00:09:08,537 --> 00:09:10,036
Don't disturb the body.

176
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:13,373
I have a spell in progress.

177
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,741
Bet you do.

178
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,108
Pack up, ok,

179
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,377
only what you want to take.

180
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,645
I'll buy you anything else you need.

181
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,814
All right.

182
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,759
You didn't reveal that I was awake.

183
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,995
We're not done talking yet.

184
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,265
You and Marcel seem very close.

185
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,534
Marcel is my family.

186
00:09:43,536 --> 00:09:45,102
And yet Marcel is someone who delights

187
00:09:45,104 --> 00:09:47,739
in harming the witches,

188
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:51,642
those people, I would think,
you would consider family.

189
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,844
This doesn't trouble you?

190
00:09:53,846 --> 00:09:57,748
No. They deserve it.

191
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,182
Why would you say that?

192
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:02,318
Because they're liars, all of them.

193
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,553
They made me and my friends

194
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:05,722
do this harvest ritual.

195
00:10:08,826 --> 00:10:10,760
They said our participation

196
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:14,697
would bring our family strength, health...

197
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,405
That we'd forever be celebrated

198
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:25,240
as saviors of the community,

199
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:28,043
but all they really wanted was more power.

200
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,379
So I left before they could get it,

201
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,047
and now they're running out of time

202
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:33,282
because after the harvest

203
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:34,616
comes the reaping,

204
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:35,784
and if they don't complete the harvest,

205
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:37,552
there won't be a reaping.

206
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,087
Soon, all the witches in the quarter

207
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:41,923
will start to lose their power.

208
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:45,927
Eventually, they'll cease
to be witches altogether.

209
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:49,130
So what does it take
to complete this ritual?

210
00:10:50,465 --> 00:10:52,900
I have to die.

211
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:00,001

212
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:14,843
Ok.

213
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:18,479
Hey, what the hell?

214
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:21,015
You're going out there, anyway, aren't you.

215
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:22,149
I want to go with you.

216
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:23,450
No, thanks.

217
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:24,685
Already got assaulted
by Klaus this morning,

218
00:11:24,687 --> 00:11:25,719
don't need a repeat.

219
00:11:25,721 --> 00:11:27,889
What if whatever is responsible

220
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,391
for all those dead
witches is still out there?

221
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:31,458
We've already established that

222
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,793
it likes me and hates witches.

223
00:11:32,795 --> 00:11:34,628
So you'll be safer with me.

224
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,886
Sorry if I'm not buying

225
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:37,858
your sudden concern for my safety.

226
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:40,234
Listen.

227
00:11:40,736 --> 00:11:42,302
The whole reason I came to this stupid town

228
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:44,905
in the first place was to
learn more about my family.

229
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:46,473
Your sister is the one that told me Marcel

230
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:47,908
ran the werewolves out of the quarter

231
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,443
into the bayou, and last night,

232
00:11:49,445 --> 00:11:50,910
pretty sure that some

233
00:11:50,912 --> 00:11:52,645
guardian angel wolf saved my life.

234
00:11:52,647 --> 00:11:53,979
So I'm coming with you.

235
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,682
Could you two be more idiotic.

236
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,153
Two can play the follow game, you know?

237
00:12:01,155 --> 00:12:02,755
You heard Klaus.

238
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,223
He and Marcel are heading
right where you're going.

239
00:12:04,225 --> 00:12:08,197
So distract them because unless
you want to lock a hormonal,

240
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,808
pregnant werewolf in a tomb,

241
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,847
I'm coming with you,

242
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,664
and wouldn't Elijah be mad if he hears

243
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,600
that the baby and I died of asphyxiation?

244
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,807
What's the matter, Rebekah?

245
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,607
You cross that I'm out with your ex?

246
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,842
What is all that dreadful

247
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,076
hillbilly racket in the background?

248
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,745
According to the dreadful signage,

249
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,780
it's Big Augggie's bayou bar.

250
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,682
Well, order up a few rounds of moonshine

251
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,684
and stay clear of the
dead witches for a few.

252
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,352
The witch is on a burial mission,

253
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,354
your baby mama is on a spirit quest,

254
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,221
and I'm keeping Elijah's
promise to keep her safe.

255
00:12:39,223 --> 00:12:42,459
So stall, please.

256
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,672
Everything ok?

257
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:59,741
Oh, just the usual... temperamental sister.

258
00:13:01,277 --> 00:13:02,978
So where's your informant?

259
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Tomas? He's out sniffing around.

260
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,681
Grab a drink. Then we'll chase him down.

261
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:11,219
Well, I suppose it will give
us a chance to talk things over,

262
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:13,855
like why you haven't returned Elijah.

263
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:15,457
Maybe your young witch

264
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,624
has grown partial to his company.

265
00:13:17,626 --> 00:13:21,728
She must get so bored.

266
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,965
You never stop, do you?

267
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,867
You never answer, do you?

268
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:28,502
Why are you so curious about Davina?

269
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,537
If I had a 16-year-old all-powerful witch

270
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,506
at my beck and call,

271
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,573
you would wonder about her, too.

272
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,210
You're never gonna get her.

273
00:13:37,212 --> 00:13:40,179
Ok. Ok.

274
00:13:40,181 --> 00:13:43,582
I'll ask the harmless questions, then.

275
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:45,451
How did you meet her?

276
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,820
Ha ha ha!

277
00:13:47,822 --> 00:13:50,222
That might surprise you.

278
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,257
This was 8 months ago,

279
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,160
before I banned the
witches from using magic.

280
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:58,463
Relations between vampires and witches

281
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,198
weren't what you'd call friendly,

282
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,334
by any means, but let's just say,

283
00:14:02,336 --> 00:14:05,702
we were a little less divided.

284
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:08,805
In fact, some of us were
getting along just fine.

285
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,322
Oh, it's so screwed up.

286
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,759
I'm dealing with whacked
out, militant witches.

287
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:31,794
Hey, you witches all got
a little crazy in you.

288
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,696
Oh, and my sister has really gone

289
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,098
off the deep end this time.

290
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,366
Yeah. Jane-Anne has got martyr

291
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:37,699
written all over her.

292
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:38,833
That's for sure.

293
00:14:38,835 --> 00:14:40,302
They've got every 16-year-old girl

294
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:42,637
in our coven dying to
be one of the 4 chosen

295
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,873
for this crazy-ass ritual.

296
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,142
Anything I can do to help?

297
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,811
No. You've caused enough trouble with them.

298
00:14:49,813 --> 00:14:52,448
What, little, old me?

299
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,449
You're a dick.

300
00:14:54,451 --> 00:14:57,085
You always stir it up with the witches,

301
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,521
which is why this...

302
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,759
stays between us.

303
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:10,564
You and Sophie? You hypocrite.

304
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:13,333
Ha ha ha!

305
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:15,001
You torture those witches,

306
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:16,336
and yet there you are, getting positively

307
00:15:16,338 --> 00:15:18,472
"Romeo and Juliet" with Sophie Deveraux.

308
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,240
Oh, it wasn't like that.

309
00:15:20,242 --> 00:15:22,576
It was a mutually satisfying hookup.

310
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:27,846
So if Sophie didn't turn to you,

311
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:31,984
her secret vampire lover,
in her hour of need,

312
00:15:31,986 --> 00:15:34,120
what did she do?

313
00:15:34,122 --> 00:15:36,688
She did what any good girl would do.

314
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,991
She went to her priest.

315
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:41,759
You've never cared about
witch business, Sophie,

316
00:15:41,761 --> 00:15:43,495
and now you have the gall to reveal

317
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:45,263
our private dealings to an outsider.

318
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:46,864
You have to find another way.

319
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:48,466
You think we do this lightly?

320
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:50,368
The vampire presence in the
quarter is growing stronger.

321
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,803
We need more power to fight them off.

322
00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:54,506
Harsh times call for harsh measures.

323
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:57,441
This is a little more than harsh, Bastiana.

324
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:59,576
You don't understand
because you don't believe.

325
00:15:59,578 --> 00:16:02,613
You've never believed, but I believe enough

326
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:05,015
to put everything on the line for this,

327
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:06,883
and being chosen for the offering,

328
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,552
it's an honor.

329
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,820
It's a myth, Jane-Anne.

330
00:16:10,822 --> 00:16:13,822
What you are planning
to do is not only wrong.

331
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:15,791
In my city, it's illegal.

332
00:16:15,793 --> 00:16:17,693
In your city full of vampires?

333
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:20,029
The vampires and the human faction

334
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:23,032
have an arrangement, just
like we have with you all.

335
00:16:23,034 --> 00:16:25,334
Protect the locals, protect our homes,

336
00:16:25,336 --> 00:16:27,002
we look the other way.

337
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:29,871
What you are planning goes too far.

338
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:32,374
We are simply taking what we need.

339
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,910
Our connection to our
ancestors weakens over time.

340
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,479
You sow, and you reap.

341
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:38,980
That's the way the harvest works.

342
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:43,218
I am the only ally you
witches have in this town.

343
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,620
Do you really want to
face Marcel without me?

344
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:48,156
Because that is what you'll be dealing with

345
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,324
if you go through with the harvest.

346
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,359
Everything ok in here, Uncle Kieran?

347
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:54,856
We were just finishing, Sean,

348
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:58,259
right?

349
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,294
I believe I've made myself clear.

350
00:17:00,296 --> 00:17:02,495
We'll take this matter to the elders.

351
00:17:07,301 --> 00:17:09,169
Continue to study, Sean.

352
00:17:09,171 --> 00:17:12,372
Your Uncle is an excellent role model.

353
00:17:17,511 --> 00:17:19,979
The witches were furious with Kieran.

354
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,981
Sophie tells me that the witches put a hex

355
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,016
on his nephew Sean, made it seem like

356
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:25,785
he was slowly losing his mind,

357
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:27,353
in order to distract Kieran

358
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:29,489
while they kept planning for the harvest.

359
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:33,526
So they attacked Kieran's nephew.

360
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:36,495
Yeah. Kid wasn't the same after that,

361
00:17:36,497 --> 00:17:38,163
ended up going postal,

362
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:40,131
killing all his fellow seminary students,

363
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,001
all of them, and then himself.

364
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:45,804
I might have read about that.

365
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:49,974
The boy killed a twin,

366
00:17:49,976 --> 00:17:51,141
or he was a twin or something.

367
00:17:51,143 --> 00:17:52,443
Oh, no, no.

368
00:17:52,445 --> 00:17:54,345
They said that he had a twin sister.

369
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,222
So enlighten me.

370
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,390
What did you mean when
you said you had to die?

371
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:09,793
That's what the harvest was.

372
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,227
They said they'd put us 4 girls

373
00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:13,196
in a state of, like, peaceful limbo

374
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:14,664
as part of the offering,

375
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,165
and then later at the reaping,

376
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:18,835
we'd awaken and be reborn.

377
00:18:18,837 --> 00:18:21,070
I never got as far as the limbo part,

378
00:18:21,072 --> 00:18:23,772
which means the harvest isn't complete.

379
00:18:23,774 --> 00:18:26,041
That's why the witches are so freaked out.

380
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:27,676
The reaping is just around the corner,

381
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:29,311
and if they don't finish it before then,

382
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:32,214
it's over.

383
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,849
All I have to do is wait it out.

384
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,417
And then what?

385
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,553
They're punished, and I'm free.

386
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:42,122
From Marcel?

387
00:18:42,124 --> 00:18:44,158
Of magic.

388
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,794
All our power will drain away.

389
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,732
I'll be normal.

390
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:54,768
Is that what you want, to be normal?

391
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,372
I just don't want to be what I am.

392
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:06,646
I can't control it sometimes, magic.

393
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:10,416
I... hurt people,

394
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,317
even when I don't mean to.

395
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,455
Why don't you tell me about your friends?

396
00:19:16,457 --> 00:19:18,824
You must miss them.

397
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,294
There's Tim.

398
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,129
He doesn't know about
any of this witch stuff.

399
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:25,798
He's normal.

400
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,500
My best friend Monique...

401
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:36,541
she was a part of the harvest, too.

402
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:38,443
She's lucky.

403
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,911
No one ever fought for me,

404
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:42,913
but someone fought for her.

405
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,515
The only one who ever spoke out

406
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,150
against the harvest was Monique's aunt.

407
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,686
And who is that?

408
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,589
Sophie Deveraux.

409
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:08,199
So this harvest thingee,

410
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,534
tell me more.

411
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:10,869
Klaus said to wait.

412
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:12,871
Yes. He also said to stay out of the bayou,

413
00:20:12,873 --> 00:20:16,774
and yet here we are amongst
the crawly, buzzy creatures.

414
00:20:16,776 --> 00:20:18,943
We're here.

415
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,968
Is that a wolf track?

416
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:48,470
Who's there?

417
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:51,540
What the hell?

418
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,509
An Original?

419
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,113
Let me understand this.

420
00:20:58,115 --> 00:20:59,481
Against all logic, you and Hayley went

421
00:20:59,483 --> 00:21:01,016
to the bayou, where you ran into a man

422
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:02,584
you think may be Marcel's informant,

423
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:04,052
and then you lost him.

424
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,820
Yes, and now that we've established

425
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:07,254
that I am a failure as a sister

426
00:21:07,256 --> 00:21:09,390
and a friend and an Original,

427
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:11,025
you should probably know he's on his way

428
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:12,694
to Marcel right now to rat me out...

429
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,095
skinny guy in a hurry,

430
00:21:14,097 --> 00:21:15,596
looks like he saw a ghost?

431
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:18,132
I'll handle it. I'll need a distraction.

432
00:21:18,134 --> 00:21:20,133
I'm on my way.

433
00:21:22,637 --> 00:21:24,838
Your sister again?

434
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,674
She craves attention. So come on.

435
00:21:27,676 --> 00:21:29,509
You were just getting to the juicy bits.

436
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:32,345
I can't joke around about this.

437
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:33,814
I've done a lot in my day,

438
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,648
but I do have a rule about kids.

439
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,817
No one but Sophie ever
questioned the harvest,

440
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:40,319
not even my own mother.

441
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,354
So neither did I.

442
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:44,356
We thought it was such an honor.

443
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:48,027
We had such faith. We were so stupid.

444
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:51,130
So how did it begin?

445
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:54,099
We were led out like princesses.

446
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:58,536
My mother was so proud.

447
00:21:58,538 --> 00:22:00,739
Our magic fades

448
00:22:00,741 --> 00:22:03,174
as our ties to our ancestors

449
00:22:03,176 --> 00:22:05,376
weaken over time.

450
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:08,178
We beseech them accept this offering

451
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,081
as a sign of our faith.

452
00:22:11,083 --> 00:22:12,883
Bastiana, one of the elders,

453
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:14,818
called upon the 4 elements to bind

454
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,020
our past and future magic together...

455
00:22:17,022 --> 00:22:19,522
Earth to connect us to our ancestors,

456
00:22:19,524 --> 00:22:22,159
water to heal the community,

457
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:25,228
wind to carry us to our
ancestors and back...

458
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:31,901
Fire to purify.

459
00:22:35,873 --> 00:22:38,174
After all our preparation,

460
00:22:38,176 --> 00:22:40,375
we knew exactly what to expect.

461
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:41,910
For weeks, they told us that the magic

462
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:43,779
in the knife they used to cut our palms

463
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:46,114
would put us to sleep and that later

464
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,950
at the reaping, we
would all be resurrected.

465
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:51,586
They said we'd awaken and all be together

466
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:54,256
and more powerful than ever,

467
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:56,123
and it was just like we rehearsed it.

468
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,524
All that was left was just a little cut

469
00:22:57,526 --> 00:23:00,161
on our palms for the blood sacrifice.

470
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,729
No! Stop!

471
00:23:04,735 --> 00:23:06,733
Bastiana, stop. You have to stop.

472
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:08,269
Bastiana, please don't do this.

473
00:23:09,571 --> 00:23:11,205
Even after Sophie tried to stop it,

474
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:12,806
we didn't suspect anything.

475
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,742
To be born, you must sacrifice.

476
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:19,478
Do you have faith?

477
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,480
They're gonna kill you!

478
00:23:23,217 --> 00:23:27,820
Oh, my God! No!

479
00:23:30,124 --> 00:23:32,124
Please stop!

480
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,827
Everyone involved in the ritual

481
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:36,929
knew that this would happen.

482
00:23:36,931 --> 00:23:39,298
Except the 4 of us.

483
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,433
They weren't putting us to sleep.

484
00:23:41,435 --> 00:23:43,802
They were slaughtering us.

485
00:23:43,804 --> 00:23:46,838
Oh! No! Stop! No, no!

486
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,505
Monique Deveraux.

487
00:23:48,507 --> 00:23:50,107
No! No!

488
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:53,344
Don't go, Monique!

489
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:55,079
I begged for someone to help.

490
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:58,282
My own mother turned away from me.

491
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,350
Sophie screamed and
screamed for her sister,

492
00:24:00,352 --> 00:24:02,853
anyone to do something...

493
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:04,821
What is wrong with you?

494
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:08,291
But no one did.

495
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,994
Yet you survived.

496
00:24:10,996 --> 00:24:13,830
Therefore, someone or something intervened.

497
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:17,299
Yes.

498
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:19,201
Someone finally did.

499
00:24:19,203 --> 00:24:22,037
Monique, run away! Run away.

500
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:33,547
Marcel.

501
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:35,709
You're the one who stopped it.

502
00:24:35,711 --> 00:24:39,413
Kieran knew every detail from Sophie.

503
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:41,481
After his nephew's massacre in the church,

504
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:43,583
he was so torn up, he left town

505
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:46,253
just before the harvest,
but on his way out,

506
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,721
he came to me, and he asked me

507
00:24:47,723 --> 00:24:49,588
to stop the harvest.

508
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,689
He knew I didn't want the witches

509
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:53,192
getting any more power,

510
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,227
and I do have a rule

511
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,561
about people abusing kids.

512
00:24:55,563 --> 00:24:59,198
So I did what he asked, but I was too late.

513
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,610
Oh, God! Monique!

514
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:14,612
Oh! No!

515
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,017
Oh, let go of me!

516
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,953
Stop it! Stop it! Let go of me!

517
00:25:21,955 --> 00:25:23,487
Stop it!

518
00:25:30,096 --> 00:25:33,597
There was something
about seeing Davina fight.

519
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,566
She didn't just go along to the slaughter,

520
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,667
you know?

521
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:40,270
I do...

522
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,938
Marcellus.

523
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:47,844
I felt like she and I,

524
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,446
we were kindred spirits.

525
00:26:16,905 --> 00:26:21,275
Every girl who died released
her power on to the next.

526
00:26:21,277 --> 00:26:22,443
When I was the last one,

527
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:23,978
I suddenly had all of it,

528
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,178
all the power that was supposed to be

529
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,446
released back into the earth

530
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:28,281
to appease our ancestors.

531
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,850
So the harvest was actually working.

532
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:33,820
Something was working, and I knew that I

533
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:35,355
was supposed to be killed so the harvest

534
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:36,656
could be completed and we would all

535
00:26:36,658 --> 00:26:39,459
be resurrected, but they lied to us

536
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,860
about how they were killing us.

537
00:26:41,862 --> 00:26:44,130
How do I know they weren't lying to us

538
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:47,866
about coming back?

539
00:26:47,868 --> 00:26:52,271
But mostly, I just didn't want to die.

540
00:26:52,273 --> 00:26:56,474
So I let him save me. Marcel saved my life.

541
00:27:06,942 --> 00:27:09,711
You're quite the knight in shining armor,

542
00:27:09,713 --> 00:27:12,046
though Davina must realize you owe her

543
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,349
as much as she owes you.

544
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:15,917
You never could have banned the witches

545
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,952
from using magic without her.

546
00:27:17,954 --> 00:27:20,521
She's not exactly besties with them.

547
00:27:20,523 --> 00:27:21,990
I'm protecting her.

548
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:23,390
A lot of them would like to get their hands

549
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,627
on her and kill her to finish the harvest.

550
00:27:25,629 --> 00:27:27,695
If they don't, the other girls stay dead,

551
00:27:27,697 --> 00:27:29,030
and they lose their power.

552
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:30,932
And if they do, you lose yours.

553
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,134
And Davina loses her life.

554
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:35,236
Ah, isn't this like old times?

555
00:27:35,238 --> 00:27:37,771
Just how drunk are you two?

556
00:27:37,773 --> 00:27:40,707
Skating on the razor's edge.

557
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:43,309
I'm gonna use the loo.

558
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:46,046
Back in a tick.

559
00:27:47,481 --> 00:27:50,617
I haven't seen his this
lushy since the twenties.

560
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:53,385
So you came to take him home?

561
00:27:53,387 --> 00:27:55,921
Why else would I be here?

562
00:27:55,923 --> 00:27:57,356
I don't know.

563
00:27:57,358 --> 00:27:58,758
Maybe to make sure I didn't get too drunk

564
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,426
and spill secrets better left unspilled

565
00:28:01,428 --> 00:28:03,763
about you and me.

566
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:08,800
I know better.

567
00:28:08,802 --> 00:28:11,202
I hope so because you don't want

568
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:13,104
to end up on the wrong side of me.

569
00:28:13,106 --> 00:28:17,608
Oh, Rebekah Mikaelson, you do not want

570
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,945
to be on the wrong side of me.

571
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:29,953
Tomas, I presume.

572
00:28:29,955 --> 00:28:31,556
Marcel asked me to find out

573
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:33,924
what you know about the dead witches.

574
00:28:33,926 --> 00:28:35,726
I heard they were going after

575
00:28:35,728 --> 00:28:37,295
some pregnant werewolf.

576
00:28:37,297 --> 00:28:39,163
She was stupid being out there all alone.

577
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,464
Yeah. She was. Yeah. She was.

578
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,099
It's amazing how gullible
some people can be.

579
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,702
Yeah.

580
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,494
You may return this now
to its rightful owner.

581
00:28:58,182 --> 00:28:59,781
It's restored.

582
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:10,726
I don't even know if I'll see him again.

583
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:29,110
Davina, this power that you contain

584
00:29:29,112 --> 00:29:30,644
drawn from your fallen friends,

585
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,979
it's too much for you.

586
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:33,513
You need control.

587
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:37,818
That requires study and practice.

588
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,487
My mother was a very powerful witch.

589
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,522
She left behind her grimoires,

590
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,291
a legacy of books filled with spells.

591
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:47,293
These books contain all of the tools

592
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:49,829
that you might need to control your magic.

593
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,500
If you free me from here,

594
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:57,737
I can share them with you.

595
00:29:57,739 --> 00:29:59,372
However, if you leave now with Marcel,

596
00:29:59,374 --> 00:30:01,907
we'll never see each other again,

597
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:05,744
and I cannot find you,
and I can't help you.

598
00:30:07,546 --> 00:30:10,749
The witches manipulated me.

599
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,985
You know how that ended.

600
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:15,988
This is not manipulation.

601
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,857
This is one thing in exchange for another.

602
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,627
I'm offering you a deal.

603
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:36,339
That was fast work, Rebekah.

604
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:37,874
Where's Marcel,

605
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,276
in there touching up his lipstick?

606
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:40,944
Credit me with some taste.

607
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:44,214
It's filthy in there. Where'd he go?

608
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:47,083
He didn't tell you he was leaving?

609
00:30:47,952 --> 00:30:49,785
No.

610
00:30:49,787 --> 00:30:52,054
Do you think he realized
we were stalling him?

611
00:30:52,056 --> 00:30:53,823
No...

612
00:30:55,692 --> 00:31:00,963
Unless he was stalling us.

613
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,026
Ok. Now is our shot.

614
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,960
You ready to blow this joint?

615
00:31:05,962 --> 00:31:08,729
Can't wait. All right.

616
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:13,034
We'll leave Elijah
behind as a parting gift.

617
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,702
Might buy me a little forgiveness

618
00:31:14,704 --> 00:31:16,437
for pulling one over on his siblings.

619
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,072
Let's go.

620
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:38,724
What's wrong?

621
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:41,560
What's happening?

622
00:31:41,562 --> 00:31:44,763
I don't know. Something is wrong.

623
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:50,102
Hey...

624
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:55,073
Marcel, there's something
dangerous out there.

625
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:58,796
Take me back.

626
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,368
Damn it.

627
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:53,375
No one is gonna look for you here.

628
00:32:54,811 --> 00:32:57,279
It's only for a little while

629
00:32:57,281 --> 00:33:00,082
till I can get you out of
town and someplace safe.

630
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:02,885
For now, I can get you whatever you want.

631
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:05,287
What do you like to do?

632
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,257
Draw.

633
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:12,226
An artist, huh? That's cool. Ok.

634
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:14,362
I can buy out Vincent's for you tomorrow,

635
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,130
maybe get you some curtains or...

636
00:33:16,132 --> 00:33:17,766
Marcel...

637
00:33:19,101 --> 00:33:21,935
You know what I really want?

638
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:26,740
I want to make them pay.

639
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,984
Elijah?

640
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:45,491
I'm pleased you stayed.

641
00:33:45,493 --> 00:33:46,859
You'll keep your promise

642
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:48,428
about your mother's spell book?

643
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,430
I will.

644
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,565
You know, difficulties aside,

645
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,802
I value my family above everything.

646
00:33:56,804 --> 00:34:00,572
I am sorry that yours failed you.

647
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:04,175
Your brother Klaus handed
you to Marcel in a box,

648
00:34:04,177 --> 00:34:06,044
yet you still don't give up on him.

649
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,979
Well, I've given up on giving up.

650
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,451
It's an affliction.

651
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:19,357
I will fight for my family
until my last breath.

652
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,493
And I'll fight the witches until mine.

653
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,507
Now what?

654
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:30,243
You're just gonna leave her
up there for anybody to find?

655
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:32,178
I'm not in the mood, Kieran.

656
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,747
You were supposed to get
her out of New Orleans

657
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:35,248
after the harvest.

658
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:37,265
We failed those other 3
girls. We didn't fail her.

659
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,866
That is why I came to you for help.

660
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,201
That was the plan.

661
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,835
Plans change.

662
00:34:41,837 --> 00:34:42,969
Especially after you found out

663
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:44,971
how powerful she was.

664
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:47,608
Let's get something straight.

665
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,176
For 8 months since you left,

666
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:51,178
I've been running this town just fine.

667
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,413
I don't need you coming back

668
00:34:52,415 --> 00:34:53,814
and getting in my business.

669
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:57,149
I will do what I want where I want. Got it?

670
00:34:57,151 --> 00:35:01,254
You want to be the boss?
You want to call the shots?

671
00:35:01,256 --> 00:35:05,725
Fine, but I call the
shots with the humans...

672
00:35:10,063 --> 00:35:13,998
and you don't want to make an enemy of me.

673
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,302
So I would suggest one thing...

674
00:35:17,304 --> 00:35:19,504
stay away from my niece.

675
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:22,374
Fine. Who the hell is your niece?

676
00:35:22,376 --> 00:35:25,644
Cami.

677
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:43,940
Those people,

678
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:46,371
all this because of a vision about my baby

679
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,930
you don't think is true.

680
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:50,166
Look.

681
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:52,375
I love Sabine,

682
00:35:52,377 --> 00:35:54,611
but she's the witch
equivalent of a drama queen.

683
00:35:54,613 --> 00:35:56,179
I've learned to take little stock

684
00:35:56,181 --> 00:35:58,815
in whatever she says or sees.

685
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:01,784
Just kind of wish she'd
kept her mouth shut.

686
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,719
The harvest ritual.

687
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:06,722
You said you didn't believe in it.

688
00:36:06,724 --> 00:36:09,090
Were you right?

689
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:11,193
No.

690
00:36:11,195 --> 00:36:13,261
I saw it with my own eyes.

691
00:36:13,263 --> 00:36:17,131
It was working. It was real.

692
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:21,101
So how can you be so sure

693
00:36:21,103 --> 00:36:23,638
Sabine's vision isn't?

694
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,020
Taking me on a field trip to distract me,

695
00:36:41,022 --> 00:36:42,756
pathetic and obvious.

696
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,123
I taught you better than that.

697
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,493
You taught me to protect what's mine.

698
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:49,829
You'll not take Davina
from me, end of story.

699
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,597
An immutable law of nature, Marcel is,

700
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,733
the strong always take from the weak.

701
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:55,200
Oh, if you were so strong,

702
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:56,902
you wouldn't have run away from new Orleans

703
00:36:56,904 --> 00:37:00,005
like a little bitch all those years ago.

704
00:37:02,376 --> 00:37:06,111
You've been playing king with a
bunch of children for too long.

705
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:07,346
Don't mistake me for one

706
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,348
of your nightwalker lackeys, Marcel.

707
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,317
I can take Davina any time I like.

708
00:37:15,355 --> 00:37:17,923
What the...

709
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:20,492
Do forgive me, Marcel.

710
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:23,594
If anyone is to teach my brother a lesson,

711
00:37:23,596 --> 00:37:25,629
it's me.

712
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,310
I don't care if we have to get you a leash.

713
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:38,912
That was your last trip to the bayou.

714
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:41,014
What is it with you and
those wolves, anyway?

715
00:37:41,016 --> 00:37:44,351
I feel like we're connected somehow.

716
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,886
I don't know.

717
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,921
Maybe it's just some pipe dream that I have

718
00:37:48,923 --> 00:37:51,857
of finding any real family out there,

719
00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:55,661
but sometimes when I feel
like it's me against the world,

720
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:57,796
it keeps me going.

721
00:37:59,766 --> 00:38:01,534
Oh, right.

722
00:38:03,103 --> 00:38:06,003
Well, if you ask me,

723
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:08,005
family is a pain in the behind,

724
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:10,308
and as for being in it alone,

725
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:12,210
how dare you?

726
00:38:12,212 --> 00:38:15,246
I don't ruin a perfectly
fabulous pair of boots

727
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:17,715
traipsing through the
bayou for just anyone.

728
00:38:23,654 --> 00:38:26,056
Nik, finally. What...

729
00:38:33,798 --> 00:38:37,032
Oh, Elijah...

730
00:38:38,263 --> 00:38:41,566
You're safe.

731
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:48,472
Now that you're home,

732
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,608
is your first plan to kill Niklaus?

733
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:53,476
Excuse me just a moment.

734
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:59,648
Where's he going?

735
00:39:21,837 --> 00:39:24,706
You're back.

736
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:26,774
I am.

737
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,855
Don't make promises you can't keep.

738
00:39:45,025 --> 00:39:47,460
Welcome home.

739
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,800
Everything that brought
us here to New Orleans

740
00:39:54,802 --> 00:39:58,203
was a lie... this story that
Sophie Deveraux fabricated,

741
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:01,507
this struggle for control
of the French quarter.

742
00:40:01,509 --> 00:40:03,708
This war between vampires and witches

743
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,076
wasn't over territory at all.

744
00:40:05,078 --> 00:40:06,844
This was over Davina.

745
00:40:06,846 --> 00:40:08,880
I swear I had no idea

746
00:40:08,882 --> 00:40:11,349
that the harvest could possibly be real.

747
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:12,884
But the one thing that you were sure of

748
00:40:12,886 --> 00:40:15,320
is that I was wrong and that I would risk

749
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:17,555
Monique's life on a maybe,

750
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:20,991
and now my daughter is dead.

751
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,496
Please tell me how to fix this.

752
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:26,997
Now that Marcel has Davina,

753
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:29,266
how are we even supposed to find her?

754
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:31,001
If we don't finish the harvest,

755
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:35,004
Monique and those two other
girls are dead for real.

756
00:40:36,573 --> 00:40:39,241
Look at me.

757
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:42,612
You and I are gonna find a way

758
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:45,415
to get Monique back.

759
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,950
It'll be our little secret.

760
00:40:47,952 --> 00:40:49,719
We'll do it together.

761
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,052
We'll seal off the cemetery

762
00:40:51,054 --> 00:40:53,388
from the vampires, find Davina,

763
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,023
stop Marcel,

764
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:57,459
and finish the ritual once and for all,

765
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:00,962
even if I have to slit
Davina's throat myself.

766
00:41:05,435 --> 00:41:07,901
8 months ago, Sophie Deveraux

767
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:11,505
and her sister Jane-Anne lost everything.

768
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:14,041
Now, 4 months after that,
a young, pregnant girl

769
00:41:14,043 --> 00:41:16,210
wanders into their restaurant.

770
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:18,011
Suddenly, all hope is renewed.

771
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:20,047
Jane-Anne actually sacrificed her life

772
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:23,350
so that her sister could
use you to find Davina.

773
00:41:23,352 --> 00:41:26,753
If Sophie Deveraux is
successful in capturing Davina,

774
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:29,922
she can return Jane-Anne's
daughter back to life.

775
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:32,625
We thought we'd come here
to wage a war for power.

776
00:41:32,627 --> 00:41:35,294
This is about family.

777
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,598
In order to return her niece to life,

778
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,735
Sophie Deveraux will fight to the death.

779
00:41:42,737 --> 00:41:45,437
That makes her more dangerous than anyone.
