14
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,870
我们拥有美好生活的三"大"要素
We got the three B's.

15
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,470
大片海滩  大杯喝酒  大波美女
Beach, booze and bodacious babes.

16
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,370
我不确定
I don't know.

17
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,240
我都有点想找警察求助了
I'm starting to think we should call the police.

18
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,080
拜托放轻松  好吗
Oh, would you relax?

19
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,510
我们都搞定了
We've got it made.

20
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:21,960
他把海边大宅借我们用一个礼拜
One whole week at his bodacious beach house,

21
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,910
而且是无附加条件[无线]
no strings attached.

22
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,480
其实  有一条线
Well, there is one string attached.

23
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,870
嗨  巴尼
Hi, Barney.

24
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:41,280
波大滔天
Bodacious.

"巴尼家的周末"
"Weekend at Barney's!"

26
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,090
什么  出什么事了
What is it? What's wrong?

27
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,630
秘技  罗宾  我的泡妞秘技
The plays, Robin, the plays.

28
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,030
那些我单身时候独创的
The ingenious techniques I used as a bachelor

29
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,660
泡波大无脑妹的把戏
to pick up busty dullards.

30
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,970
在我脑中一波波袭来  我关不掉那些画面
They just keep coming to me; I can't turn them off.

31
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,150
没事的  巴尼  我来帮你顺顺毛
Okay, Barney, let me ease your mind, okay?

32
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,390
好的  来吧
All right, here we go.

33
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,260
记不记得你烧掉《泡妞秘笈》那天
Remember when you set your Playbook on fire?

34
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,110
就在那一刻  我觉得你是可以托付终生的男人
That was the moment I realized you were someone I could marry.

35
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,770
如果可以重来  我还是会选择烧掉它
And I'd burn it again if I could.

36
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,680
你说得对
You're right.

37
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,520
我已经厌倦那些把戏了
I'm done with all these plays.

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,390
而且  "巴尼家的周末"
Besides, there's no way I'll ever come up

39
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,140
是我的巅峰之作  没有什么可以超越了
with anything that tops "Weekend at Barney's."

40
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,250
"巴尼家的周末  第二集"
"Weekend at Barney's Two!"

41
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,120
去死吧  巴尼
Damn it, Barney!

42
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,920
今晚有个大型画展开幕
So, there's this big gallery opening tonight.

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,080
我们很乐意出席  可惜我们要去...
Oh, we'd love to, but we've got this, um...

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,130
创世纪乐队回归演唱会  在麦迪逊广场花园
Genesis reunion, Madison Square Garden,

45
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,840
前排座位  绝对会成为传...
front row. It's gonna be legend...

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,090
我没有要邀请你们
I wasn't inviting you guys.

47
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,730
谢天谢地  其实没有什么演唱会
Oh, thank God. There is no concert.

48
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,750
作为船长新任的艺术买手
As the captain's new art buyer,

49
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,260
有一个新秀艺术家叫斯特里克兰・史蒂文斯
I have to go schmooze this up-and-coming artist,

50
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,590
我得去跟他套套近乎
Strickland Stevens,

51
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,910
这样就可以近水楼台先得月了
so we get first dibs on all his new stuff.

52
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,720
我负责帮莉莉把买卖拿下
And I'll be helping Lily seal the deal

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,630
通过开几个与艺术沾边的玩笑
by impressing the intelligentsia

54
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,430
博取那个知识分子的好感
with some art-related hilarity.

55
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,350
所以我准备了几个笑话
I've prepared some jokes.

56
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,940
为什么艺术品商人付不起房租
Why couldn't the art dealer pay his rent?

57
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,390
-不知道  为什么  -我要听不下去了
- I don't know. Why? - This is gonna be rough.

58
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,480
因为"莫奈"没了
Because he ran out of Monet.

59
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,480
莫奈和金钱英文读音相近

60
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,450
你们会在回家路上琢磨出笑点的
You're gonna get that on the walk home.

61
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,520
再听听这个
How about this one?

62
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,070
我们...我们特别爱听你讲笑话
You know what, we'd... we'd love to hear it,

63
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,050
但是我们要去...那个...
but we've got that, um... that...

64
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,760
斯迪力・丹乐队  卡内基音乐厅
Steely Dan, Carnegie Hall,

65
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
后台通行证  快走
backstage pass. Let's go.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,300
-我们可不想错过他们不知道啥的经典名曲  -对
- We don't want to miss whatever their big song was. - Yeah.

67
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,900
答应你们的婚礼请柬答复卡
Your wedding response card, as promised.

68
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,460
你为什么不跟别人一样  邮寄给我们呢
Why didn't you just mail it like everybody else?

69
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,790
罗宾  太伤心了
Oh, see, that's sad, Robin.

70
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,120
我亲手奉上  你应该感动啊
You should be touched that I hand-delivered it.

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,440
社交媒体已经把我们的人际关系侵蚀了吗
Has social media so eroded our interpersonal relationships

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,860
人们再也不想体验...
that we no longer wish to experience the...

73
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,010
你只是舍不得花钱买邮票
You wanted to keep the stamp?

74
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,010
都涨到46美分一张了
They're 46 cents now.

75
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,870
简直无法无天了
It's getting out of hand.

76
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,250
"我们很高兴接受您的邀请
"Your invitation is joyfully accepted

77
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:59,310
泰德・莫斯比和珍妮特上"
by Mr. Ted Mosby and Jeanette""

78
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,670
<i>孩子们  还记得吧</i>
<i>Kids, as you'll recall,</i>

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,990
<i>珍妮特是遇见你们妈妈前</i>
<i>Jeanette was the last girl I dated</i>

80
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,380
<i>我交的最后一个女朋友</i>
<i>before I met your mother.</i>

81
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,510
<i>我的朋友们对她  只有一点不满</i>
<i>My friends only had one tiny problem with her.</i>

82
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,190
<i>她是疯子</i>
<i>She was nuts.</i>

83
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,140
所以你要带女伴参加啊
So you're bringing a plus one?

84
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,890
如果算上她的分裂人格
If you count the voices in her head,

85
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,120
其实带了五个女伴
it's plus five.

86
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,890
大伙  我会带她出席
Guys, I'm bringing her,

87
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:19,960
而且你们一定和她相处得很愉快
and you're gonna love having her there.

88
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,960
对了  顺便说一句
Oh, and, um, by the way,

89
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,000
有件事希望你们不要有意见
just so this doesn't turn into an argument later,

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,910
她那天会穿白礼服
the dress she's gonna wear

91
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,830
严格说不是纯白色  是米白色
isn't technically white; it's eggshell.

92
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,270
不过  她会穿纯白的鞋子
The shoes are white, though.

93
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,740
戴纯白的手套
And the gloves.

94
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,280
还有面纱  就这样  拜拜
And the veil. Well, see you guys.

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,710
别走  别走  莫斯比
No, no, no. Mosby! Get...

96
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,750
我的天啊  发生什么事了
Oh, my God, what happened?

97
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,030
我刚砸了你的公寓
Oh, I trashed your apartment.

98
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,380
我刚才有点无聊
See, I got bored,

99
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,250
-就开始翻你的电子邮件  -好吧
- so I started going through all your E-mails. - Sure.

100
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,880
我发现有个女人给你
And I found one from a woman

101
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,530
发了一封标题为《大乓高潮》的邮件
with the subject line, "Big penis orgasms,"

102
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,460
所以很自然地  我砸烂你的盘子
so naturally, I smashed your plates,

103
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,260
划穿你的床垫  还在你抽屉里撒尿
knifed your mattress, peed in your drawers,

104
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,960
九个抽屉无一幸免  
the whole nine, but then,

105
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,860
当我准备把屎拉在你马桶水箱时
while I was upper-decking your toilet,

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,740
我仔细看了一下那封邮件
I actually read the e-mail.

107
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,580
结果那是封垃圾邮件
Turns out it was spam.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,310
典型的珍妮特作风  对吧
Classic Jeanette, huh?

109
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,120
老天啊
Oh, my God.

110
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,210
你绝对是病理学上的疯...
You are certifiably insane...

111
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,060
狂爱我啊
...about me.

112
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,390
快过来  小傻瓜
Come here, you knucklehead.

113
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,680
我对你真是生不起气来
I can't stay mad at you.

114
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,050
泰德  泰德  我想跟你分手
Ted, Ted, I'm breaking up with you.

115
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,960
你总是紧张兮兮
You're just so intense,

116
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,630
而且我们进展太快了
and it's all moving way too fast.

117
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,230
钥匙还给你
Here's your key back.

118
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,120
我没给过你钥匙啊
I never gave you a key.

119
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,150
你祖母的戒指也还给你
And here's your grandmother's ring.

120
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:30,720
她不是戴着这戒指入土的吗
She was buried wearing this.

121
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,760
就这样  我们分手了
And just like that, it was over.

122
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,480
我发短信告诉巴尼和罗宾了
I texted Barney and Robin.

123
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,870
他们听说珍妮特不出席婚礼
I'm sure they're over the moon

124
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,090
肯定高兴得不得了吧
that Jeanette's not coming to the wedding.

125
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,750
不  泰德  不会的
Oh, no, Ted, no.

126
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,380
他们不会把快乐建筑在你的悲伤之上
They're not gonna be happy about you being sad.

127
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,470
他俩终于分手了
They broke up!

128
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,850
泰德  容我冒昧问一句
Ted, respectfully,

129
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,190
你真的觉得这女孩是你的天命真女吗
are you sure that this was the right girl for you?

130
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,740
绝对不是
Of course not.

131
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,270
她是个疯子
She was crazy.

132
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,540
绝对是个噩梦
Absolutely a nightmare.

133
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,740
完全不值得为她劳心费神
It's totally not worth the trouble.

134
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,390
我是说  无论如何
I mean, no matter how...

135
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,670
不管我们的性爱有多棒
no matter how great the sex was.

136
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,890
兄弟  别让精虫上脑
Stay with us, buddy.

137
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,570
不管场面多么热辣  多么激情四射
No matter how hot and passionate

138
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,190
多么奇招百出
and surprising,

139
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,730
或许违法了...
possibly illegal...

140
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,080
-我不喜欢这样  -我也是
- I don't like this. - Me, neither.

141
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,630
我要把她追回来
I'm gonna win her back.

142

巴尼和罗宾一定会为我的幸福而高兴的
Barney and Robin are gonna be so happy I'm happy.

143
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,160
我懂  我懂
I know. I know.

144
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,170
你是不是把我胸罩解开了
Did you just unhook my bra?

145
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,280
乖  乖
There, there.

146
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,250
<i>当晚也是画展之夜</i>
<i>That night was the big gallery show.</i>

147
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,180

148
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,440
-我刚去杂货店买了一份零食  -为什么
- I decided to grab a snack from the bodega. - Why?

149
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,860
画展都会准备吃的
They'll have food at the gallery.

150
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,650
拜托  这些地方从来没吃的
Oh, come on, these places never have food.

151
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,650
没事的
It's fine.

152
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:41,650
我拿了些彩虹糖
I got some Skittles.

153

<i>那是你马修叔叔</i>

<i>买的最后一包彩虹糖</i>

156
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,460
<i>而跑到她家</i>
<i>to win her back.</i>

157
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,400
什么情况
What the hell?

158
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,340
我不能让你这么做  泰德
I can't let you do this, Ted.

159

-我要追回珍妮特  -不行

泰德  我的唯一准则是什么

《泡妞秘笈》  你不是烧了吗

我又没烧那本真的

202
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,850
因为你坐着的一件价值8万美元的雕塑
Well, you're sitting on an $80,000 sculpture.

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,140

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,930
估计有D罩杯
Possible delta cups.

252
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,740
收到  确定目标
Copy that. Engaging target.

253
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
完了
Over.

254
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,750
打扰了  我有一份给丽莎的快递
Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa.

255
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,270
打扰了  我有一份给丽莎的快递
Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa.

256
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,470
-你是丽莎吗  -你是丽莎吗
- Are you Lisa? - Are you Lisa?

257
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,640
不是
Uh, no.

258
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
可是应该就是你啊
But you must be.

259
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,210
有人让我
I was told to...

260
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,590
把这个包裹给一个叫丽莎的女孩
...deliver this package to a girl named Lisa,

261
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,780
我可以不费力就认出她
and that I'd recognize her because she'd be...

262
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,120
因为她是酒吧里最漂亮的女孩
The most beautiful girl in this bar.

263
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,110
给  你的包裹   丽莎
So, here's your delivery, lisa.

264
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,920
我真不是丽莎
Uh, I am definitely not Lisa,

265
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,930
不过我很乐意帮你找到她
but I would be happy to help you find her.

266
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,050
很好  等会儿也许...
Great, and then maybe later...

267
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,720
我可以给你一个新的包裹  我的老二
I could give you a different package-- my penis.

268
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,580
这台词真是糟透了
That is a terrible line!

269
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,720
你说的方式错了
You said it wrong.

270
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,300
我没说错
I did not say it wrong.

271
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,170
我的老二
My penis.

272
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,750
-不对  -我的老二
- No. - My penis.

273
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,730
语气还是不对
Still not right.

274
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:22,100
我的老二  我的老二  我的老二
My penis, my penis, my penis!

275
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,640
大家好
Hello.

276
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,710
太不爽了
This sucks.

277
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,090
我无法接近斯特里克兰
I can't get near Strickland.

278
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,200
至少马修玩得挺开心
At least Marshall's having a good time.

279
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
他总是能找对话题跟别人聊
Man, he always knows just the right thing to say.

280
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,660
作为一个同性恋  安迪・沃霍尔当然喜欢瓶瓶罐罐
For a gay guy, Andy Warhol sure liked cans.

281
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,660
20世纪艺术界最有名的人物之一  
将浓汤罐头与可乐瓶化身成艺术品

282
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,210
太失败了
This sucks.

283
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,170
也许我的魅力已不如从前
Maybe I've lost my charm.

284
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,330
不  马修
No, Marshall,

285
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,430
如果莉莉能在这个艺术殿堂里游刃有余
if Lily's gonna make it in this fancy art world,

286
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,890
你也能做到  振作起来
you're gonna have to make it, too, so suck it up,

287
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,830
别坐在艺术品上
stop sitting on the art,

288
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,250
秀出最好的自己
and bust out the "A" material.

289
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,290
你俩继续这样多干几杯
You two keep chugging like that,

290
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,990
你们就要
you're gonna have to

291
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,800
文森特・梵[去]厕所了  对吧
Vincent van go to the bathroom, am I right?

292
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,550
人家叫文森特・梵高
It's pronounced van Gogh.

293
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,040
去你的高
Oh, "Blogh" Me.

294
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,660
捐肾

295
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,060
我还是不明白  为什么出院之前
I still don't get why someone would leave the hospital

296
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,340
不换衣服呢  完毕
without changing into their clothes first. Over.

297
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,340
泰德  这是我的招
Ted, this is my thing.

298
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,140
就...  行吗
So just... okay?

299
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,150
完毕
Over.

300
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,440
行吗  完毕
Okay? Over.

301
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,040
你没事吧
Are you all right?

302
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,310
什么
What? Oh.

303
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,660
我没事  没事
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

304
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,760
明天  我...
Tomorrow, I'm...

305
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,610
要捐一个肾给我的好朋友
donating a kidney to my best friend.

306
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,540
我的挚友  巴尼
My best friend Barney.

307
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,380
不是马修
Not Marshall.

308
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,860
是巴尼
Barney.

309
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,850
马修弱爆了
Marshall's so lame.

310
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,040
总之...
Anyway, uh...

311
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,440
我只想最后再喝一杯  以防...
just wanted to grab one last drink, in case...

312
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,510
我没挺过来
you know, I don't make it.

313
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,720
你真勇敢
You are so brave.

314
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,800
听我说
Hey, listen.

315
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,710
在捐赠我这个器官之前  不如...
Before I give my best friend this organ, how about...

316
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,590
不行
Nope.

317
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,600
不  我不会那么说
Nope, I'm not saying that.

318
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,870
我听到了
I did hear you,

319
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,550
不过我不会说
but I'm not saying that.

320
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,380
因为我不会说
Because I'm not.

321
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,240
你没事吧
Are you okay?

322
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,150
等等  我知道你倾注了很多心血
One second. I know you put a lot of work into this.

323
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,770
我明白
I understand that.

324
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,560
我明白
I understand that.

325
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,420
我明白
I understand that.

326
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,090
我明白
I understand that.

327
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,290
我为什么不能和她聊聊天
Why can't I just talk to her?

328
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,020
可能会擦出什么火花呢
Maybe we'll hit it off...

329
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,540
好吧
Fine.

330
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,820
收到
Copy that.

331
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,690
不如我把另一个器官给你
How about I give you a different organ?

332
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,210
我的老二
My penis.

333
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,300
-你说的方式错了  -我没有说错
- You said it wrong. - I did not say it wrong!

334
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,480
感谢大家的光临
Thank you all so much for coming.

335
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,470
如果大家允许的话
If you'll indulge me,

336
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,040
我想给大家讲个关于
I would like to share a story

337
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,910
我过世的祖母的故事
about my dearly departed grandmother.

338
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,090
天啊
Oh, God.

339
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,260
告诉你个新闻  强尼・阿斯科特
News flash, Johnny Ascot:

340
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,150
很多人的祖母都过世了
Lots of people have dead grandmas.

341
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,330
不  马修
No, Marshall.

342
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,510
别这么尖酸
Don't be bitter.

343
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,220
你是为了莉莉来的
You're here for Lily.

344
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,720
看看她  那么专业
Just look at her, so professional.

345
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,440
她可还没坐过一件艺术品呢
She hasn't sat on a single piece of art.

346
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,820
为了莉莉  你得有风度地忍着
You're gonna ride this thing out with dignity for Lily.

347
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,280
不能再做让她尴尬的事情
Not one more thing that might embarrass her.

348
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,550
我就站在这里
I will simply stand here.

349
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,670
完全隐形
Perfectly invisible.

350
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,680
所有  我把这场展览
And so I dedicate this show

351
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,050
献给我的祖母
to my grandmother's memory.

352
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,690
现在
Now...

353
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,250
为了纪念她  请和我一起
please join me in honoring her

354
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,870
静默一分钟
with 60 seconds of absolute silence.

355
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,960
我有一个宠物叫尼斯湖水怪

356
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,780
好啦  聂鲁达  这场戏非常复杂
Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated.

357
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,190
我猜  是要我用苏格兰口音
Let me guess. Does it involve me

358
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,170
说出"我的老二"吗
saying "My penis" in a Scottish accent?

359
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,390
渐入佳境啊  小伙子[苏格兰口音]
Now you're gettin' it, laddie!

360
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,780
罗宾  你来干嘛呢
Robin. What are you doing here?

361
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,270
我只是好奇你有没有
I was curious as to whether

362
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,950
给泰德找到女伴参加我们的婚礼
you found Ted a date to our wedding

363
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,660
找一个不这么...像魔鬼的女伴
who was a little less, you know, antichrist-y.

364
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,930
那是《泡妞秘笈》吗
Is that the Playbook?

365
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,710
不是  罗宾  那是沙发
No, Robin, that is a couch.

366
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,040
你是说沙发上的《泡妞秘笈》吗
Oh, you mean the Playbook on the couch?

367
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,260
-我可以解释  -不用了
- I can explain. - Don't bother.

368
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,680
我能...  泰德
I can ex... Uh, Ted? Uh...

369
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,390
我得离开指挥中心一下
I got to step away from mission control for a sec.

370
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,480
我走了之后  不要做任何傻事
Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.

371
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,840
罗宾
Robin...

372
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,750
罗宾  等等
Robin, wait.

373
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,710
糟糕  我还没想好
Um... shoot. I haven't figured out

374
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,690
要说什么  你继续走
what I'm gonna say yet. Keep going.

375
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,880
罗宾  等等
Robin, wait.

376
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,380
很抱歉  我还留着《泡妞秘笈》
Look, I'm sorry that I still have the Playbook.

377
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,480
可是那本书包含了我一生的好点子
It's just, it's filled with a lifetime of great ideas.

378
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,850
我应该把这些心血都扔了吗
Am I supposed to just leave all that behind?

379
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,040
-是的  -但是...
- Yes. - But...

380
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,300
"巴尼家的周末"
"Weekend at Barney's"!

381
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,520
那是什么
Okay, what is that?

382
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,820
给我解释一下"巴尼家的周末" 
Explain the "Weekend at Barney's" to me.

383
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,710
这还用解释吗
What's to explain?

384
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,880
我假扮死人
I play a dead guy,

385
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
泰德和马修拉我到处转悠
and Ted and Marshall carry me around.

386
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,600
好吧  凭这点  就有女人想和你上床
Okay. And based on that, girls want to sleep with you.

387
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,210
-超成功的  -但你死了
- Big time. - But you're dead.

388
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,220
对  但显然不是真死了
Yeah. Except not really, obviously.

389
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,440
但你泡的妞以为你死了
But the girl thinks you're dead.

390
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,480
不  她以为我活着
No, she thinks I'm alive.

391
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,620
-你本来就活着  -对
- Which you are. - Exactly.

392
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,270
-除了你死了  -对
- Except you're dead. - Exactly.

393
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,900
-只是你活着  -对
- Except you're alive. - Exactly.

394
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,090
好吧  与其一个大活人
Okay, so instead of... of being an alive person

395
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,650
假扮一个死人
pretending to be a dead person

396
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,690
假扮的活人
pretending to be an alive person,

397
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,160
为什么不就做个活人呢
why not just be an alive person?

398
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,170
好吧  我们从头说起
Okay, let's start from the beginning.

399
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,130
电影名叫《伯尼家的周末》
The movie is called Weekend at Bernie's.

400
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,820
而我叫巴尼
My name is Barney.

401
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,930
真是太对不起了  亲爱的
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

402
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:10,810
不知道你听到没
I don't know if you heard,

403
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,640
我掉了些彩虹糖豆
but I dropped some Skittles.

404
