为什么你等这么久才来?

我发现你的贵妇风范令人吃惊

连尝试都不去做...这种建议...

25
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:33,096
是个馊主意

悉听尊便!
Do your worst.

27

从没人提及过讹诈之事

我犯下了一个弥天大错
I made a hideous mistake.

284
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,924

00:28:10,944 --> 00:28:12,782
更值得一访吗?
might be more worth a visit

320
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,516
既然Dorking写信给了你?
since Dorking wrote to you?

321
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,399
那是过去了 华生
That is past Watson.

322
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:17,304
我们现在要做的

323

是紧紧盯上他的下一个受害者

所以这个晚上我要尽可能地去了解Milverton?

00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,733

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,812
我要和他谈话吗?

00:28:31,887 --> 00:28:33,903
是的 但是小心些

329
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,965
先生在吃午饭的时候病倒了 小姐

338
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:15,357
有多糟糕?
How bad is it?

339
00:30:15,805 --> 00:30:18,378
Bainey医生不太乐观
Doctor Bainey's not optimistic.

340
00:30:18,448 --> 00:30:20,179
如果他活了下来

341
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:24,455
也会是瘫痪

342

我突然想到
It occurs to me

358
00:31:31,298 --> 00:31:33,065
我没有被邀请
that I mightnot have been

359
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,739
就去看展览 福尔摩斯
invited to this viewing Holmes.

360
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:38,801
如果不让我进怎么办?
What if I'm not admitted huh?

361
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,081
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

362
00:31:51,336 --> 00:31:53,174
福尔摩斯先生刚出去了吗?
Is that Mr. Holmes just going out?

363
00:31:53,251 --> 00:31:56,204
我也没有看清楚 医生
Not that I recognize Doctor.

364
00:32:26,753 --> 00:32:29,830
女士们先生们 闲话不说
Without more ado ladies and gentlemen

00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:32,379
为了它我们聚集在此

我觉得本人更温柔 更美丽

368

我应该坚持让Whistler为你作画

369
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,267
荣幸之至
It was a great honor.

借光
Excuse me,

376
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,617
Swinstead女士 恕我冒昧
Lady Swinstead, I'm afraid.

00:34:01,694 --> 00:34:03,496
我的丈夫?
My husband?

Swinstead女士
Lady Swinstead.

383
00:34:27,856 --> 00:34:30,358
不过我在想...
I wonder though

384
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,834
他是不是画对了她的嘴唇
if he's quite got her mouth right.

385
00:34:36,345 --> 00:34:38,491
失败啊
Disaster.

386
00:34:57,636 --> 00:34:58,845
我认识你吗?
Do I know you?

387
00:34:58,923 --> 00:34:59,782
嗯
Yeah.

388
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:01,924
你为Milverton工作 不是吗?
You work for Milverton don't you?

00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,239
为他干活好吗?
Is he good to work for?

390
00:35:04,315 --> 00:35:06,117
要是没有那可恶的水管就还不错
He would be if weren't for the bloody plumbing.

391
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:07,102
水管?
Plumbing?

392
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,303
永远都漏水
Always drippin off the spout

393
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,208
永远都是我的错
and it's always my fault.

00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,632
看看你干了什么
Look what you've done.

00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:16,773

That's my pint is it?

396
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:19,171
我们来亲个嘴儿

00:35:19,972 --> 00:35:21,631

00:35:24,564 --> 00:35:26,058
滚开
Get off.

400
00:35:32,218 --> 00:35:33,851
我们从没叫过水管工
We never sent for the plumber.

401
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,373
你好
Oh hello.

402
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,890
是Stokes叫我来的
It was Stokes.

403
00:35:46,968 --> 00:35:49,256
是吗?
Oh was it?

404
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:01,051
Robert 这是... 你叫什么?
Robert this is...what's your name?

405
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:02,680

00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:03,772
"我们一管到底"
We plumb the depths,

407
00:36:03,809 --> 00:36:05,556
我公司的座右铭
it's my firms motto.

408
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,116
他说是你叫来的
He says you sent for him.

409
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:09,610
那麻烦在哪儿?
Where's the trouble?

410
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:11,225
啊 我看到了
Awe, I see.

411
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:23,021
这里怎么回事?
What's going on here?

412
00:36:33,343 --> 00:36:35,394
我在问你这里发生了什么事情?
I asked you what's going on here?

413
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,516
他是来修水管的 Hebworth先生
He's come about the plumbing Mr. Hebworth.

414
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:40,256
我自作主张叫他来看看
I took the liberty of asking him to come and look at it.

415
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:41,389
不是吗 Aggie?
Didn't I Aggie?

416
00:36:41,427 --> 00:36:43,854
你没有自作主张的权利
You have no right to take liberties.

417
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:45,132
这里归我管
I'm in charge here.

418
00:36:45,206 --> 00:36:46,937
但是我们得修好它 Hebworth先生
But we do need it done Mr. Hebworth.

419
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:50,075
我是说 Milverton先生昨天还在说
I mean, Mr. Milverton was only saying yesterday

420
00:36:50,147 --> 00:36:56,613
管子里传出一股很难闻的味道
that there was a very, ugly smell coming from the piping.

421
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:58,110
好吧
Very well.

422
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,293
那就继续吧
Carry on then.

423
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:13,762
他早出晚归
He came in late and went out early.

424
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:16,198
谢谢你 Hudson太太
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

425
00:37:19,891 --> 00:37:22,179
真遗憾啊
Shame isn't it?

426
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:28,020
他是个优秀的政治家 华生
He was a fine statesmen Watson.

427
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:30,498
听说 他的交际手腕
It was his diplomacy, I'm told,

428
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:32,825
在几年前那段非常时期里
which eased Anglo-French relationships

429
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:35,892
缓和了美国和法国之间的紧张关系
at a most delicate time some year's back.

430
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:41,006
他的遗孀听到这心碎的消息时 我也在场呢
To think that I was there with his widow when the news was broken to her.

431
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,846
Milverton
Milverton.

432
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:45,495
我和他聊了几句
I exchanged a word with him.

433
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:49,244
一副充满算计 虚情假意的笑容
A more calculatingly insincere smile

434
00:37:49,323 --> 00:37:51,304
我真希望再也不要看到

435
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:53,772
Charles Augustus
Charles Augustus.

436
00:37:53,846 --> 00:37:58,079
据说他是一名艺术领域的鉴赏家
And described to me as a connoisseur in art matters.

437
00:37:58,161 --> 00:38:00,177
一个商人 只要他出马

438
00:38:00,248 --> 00:38:04,521
就能让任何一名艺术家发家致富
the fortune's of any artist to whom he devotes himself.

439
00:38:04,596 --> 00:38:06,849
不知廉耻
Stems of hell!

440
00:38:06,927 --> 00:38:10,817
他是许多伦敦俱乐部里的会员
He's a member of a number of London clubs.

441
00:38:10,894 --> 00:38:13,076
因此我猜测
On the basis I suppose

442
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:16,250
那些人并不和他唱反调
that there are those who do not oppose him.

443
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,302
但Diogenes俱乐部不是 (福尔摩斯哥哥的俱乐部 见"希腊议员案")
Not the Diogenes.

444
00:38:18,374 --> 00:38:20,033
我听我的哥哥Microft说
I heard my brother Microft

445
00:38:20,113 --> 00:38:24,674
他自己找上门来 结果碰了一鼻子灰走了
that he presented himself and was turned away with a flea in his ear.

446
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,937
你的这位绅士敲诈犯
You're gentleman blackmailer

447
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:32,114
出生在Balum
was born in Balum.

448
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,687
一个磨工和他妻子的独子
The only son of a glazer and his wife.

449
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:36,668
你从哪儿听说的?
Your source of information?

450
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:38,651
很多地方
Oh a variety of sources.

451
00:38:38,725 --> 00:38:41,050
我用了你的方法
I applied your methods.

452
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,069
你乔装成了谁?
How have you faired?

453
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:45,195
我进入了堡垒
I've entered the fortress

454
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,068
我是个生意兴隆的水管工
I'm a plumber of a rising business,

455
00:38:47,144 --> 00:38:49,017
化名Escotts
Escotts my name.

456
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,965
男管家名叫Hebworth
The butler, who goes under the name of Hebworth,

457
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,745
不是别人 正是那个男仆Veitch
is none other than Veitch the footman,

458
00:38:53,824 --> 00:38:56,784
脸上中了枪 我敢肯定
who was shot in the face. I'm certain of it.

459
00:38:57,894 --> 00:39:00,704
或许Milverton之所以雇了他
Perhaps he was employed by Milverton

460
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,763
是作为他在Kroft丑闻事件中
as a reward for keeping his silence

461
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:05,265
保持沉默的奖励
during the Kroft scandal.

462
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,036
我很想知道
I wonder.

463
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:16,147
你的管道被空气堵塞了  Hebworth先生
You got air compression in your cell pipes Mr. Hebworth.

464
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,897
才让这房子里一股臭味
That's the cause of the evil smell in this house.

465
00:39:20,403 --> 00:39:25,408
这些在下面接水
What this warrants is a save all below it

466
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:29,789
脏水就不会淤积了
so the dirty water don't get clogged up.

467
00:39:45,904 --> 00:39:48,477
你在这里干什么!
What the devil are you doing here?

468
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:51,738
他是个水管工 先生
It's the plumber sir.

469
00:39:51,818 --> 00:39:54,178
这屋子里不需要水管工
There's no need of a plumber in this room.

470
00:39:54,254 --> 00:39:55,985
滚出去
Get out.

471
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:04,331
这是主人的特别房间

00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:26,719

Aggie?

474
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:33,594
待会儿见 是我的水管工来了
I'll see you later it's my plumber.

475
00:40:41,046 --> 00:40:42,670
Aggie?
Aggie?

我不喜欢你的主人 Aggie

我觉得他不像个好人

480
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:55,401
你说得没错

481
00:41:04,564 --> 00:41:06,852
我的天

482
00:41:29,995 --> 00:41:31,660
Lillie
Lillie.

483
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:33,347
她不会为了那活过来做的
She won't come here for that Job.

484
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,097
她干嘛想到这里来做呢?
Why would she want to work here for?

485
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:37,158
她才是个真正的侍女
She was a real lady's maid,

486
00:41:37,196 --> 00:41:38,709
从她的穿着你就能看出来
you could tell by her clothes.

487
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,022
那她是为了什么来呢?
What was she after then?

00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,286
我不知道该怎么做

一个我们可以把Milverton

00:42:27,015 --> 00:42:28,697
绳之以法的办法
within the grasp of the law.

499
00:42:30,982 --> 00:42:33,686
如果我们能引诱他去敲诈
If we could tempt him to blackmail

500
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:37,204
一个无辜的人 我们就能抓住他了
an innocent person we should have him.

501
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:38,831
现在假设...
Now suppose...

502
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:42,596
我收到了一些不体面的信
suppose I was to be the recipient of some indiscreet letters.

503
00:42:42,671 --> 00:42:43,571
你吗 华生?
You Watson?

504
00:42:43,608 --> 00:42:45,681
那谁写这些信呢?
Who would prey write these letters?

505
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:47,494
某个我们的熟人
Someone of our acquaintance.

506
00:42:47,964 --> 00:42:49,377
而你身为一个水管工
And you and your plumbing persona

00:42:49,455 --> 00:42:51,506
可以把它们拿去卖

Lastrade就可以随时逮捕他
Lastrade would be on hand to arrest him.

510
00:42:56,761 --> 00:43:00,473
但是法律上说 我们无法行动
But legally we cannot move

511
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:02,355
直到某个被害人准备好了
until some victim is prepared

512
00:43:02,431 --> 00:43:04,447
牺牲自己的名声

514

一定有什么办法

有的

-我觉得配不上 -胡说

买那些尊贵富有 地位显赫的人的信

她看见了他的马车

642

他让他的受害人精神紧张
He rings the nerves of his victims

643
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:15,206
让自己原本就鼓鼓的钱包更鼓
to add to his already swollen moneybags.

644
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:18,693
他是伦敦最差劲的男人
He is the worst man in London.

645
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:22,028
偷鸡摸狗 诡计多端
Seething, slithering and sly.

646
00:53:22,107 --> 00:53:25,242
难道除了留在这里

和他对质 讨个说法
Confront him. Challenge him.

650
00:53:31,361 --> 00:53:34,385
先动脑子再动手
The brain before the cudgel rule.

651
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,916
同时
Meanwhile,

652
00:53:35,988 --> 00:53:37,826
他会故伎重演
just like him,

653
00:53:37,902 --> 00:53:39,325
不断勒索他的受害人
he'll squeeze his victims

654
00:53:39,398 --> 00:53:41,379
直到把他们榨干为止
till he's drained them dry

655
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,376
我们却不去阻止他
and we're doing nothing to stop him.

656
00:53:45,452 --> 00:53:47,503
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

657
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:59,225

00:54:12,761 --> 00:54:15,750
没有

这房子里的人几点上床 Aggie?

665
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:13,015
你想知道这个干什么?
What do you want to know for?

666
00:55:13,086 --> 00:55:17,427
我就可以知道什么时候来看你是安全的
So I know when it's safe to visit you.

667
00:55:17,505 --> 00:55:20,695
你可以随时到墙边来
You could always come in over the wall.

668
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,665
用小卵石敲我的窗户
Throw pebbles at my window.

669
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:27,765
哪扇是你的窗?
Which is your window?

670
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:32,772
如果你娶了我
I'll only tell you

671
00:55:32,847 --> 00:55:34,471
我就告诉你 亲爱的
if you marry me love.

672
00:55:34,551 --> 00:55:36,611
-Aggie 我不能 -那我就不告诉你
-Oh Aggie I can't. -Then I wont tell.

673
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:39,105
你总是那么牙尖嘴利
You have such a way with words.

674
00:55:40,999 --> 00:55:42,620
好吧
All right.

675

我在最上面的角落里
I'm at the very, very top on the corner

676
00:55:46,763 --> 00:55:49,123
而主人 他在下面一层

677
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,009
但是他靠近花园
but he's next to the garden

678
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:54,268
Hebworth先生
and Monsieur Hebworth

679
00:55:54,347 --> 00:55:55,935
他在一楼
he's on the ground floor

680
00:55:56,017 --> 00:55:58,377
穿过书房就是
just across from the study.

681
00:55:58,452 --> 00:56:00,669
Lewis睡觉的时候 你来了也吵不醒他
Lewis is sleeping don't you come wake him.

682
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,302
仆人厅里一直流传这个笑话
There's a joke in the servant's hall.

683
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,843
为什么他不睡楼上呢?
Why don't he sleep upstairs?

684
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:09,478
因为主人想让他看门
Because the master wants him on guard.

685
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:17,681
他怕夜贼
He's afraid of burglars.

686
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:20,121
你是夜贼吗?
Are you a burglar?

华生 你会很有兴趣听到下面这个消息

701
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:27,588

00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:29,006

703

没有办法 华生
Can't help it Watson.

713
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:01,892
在这种赌博下
One must play one's cards as best one can

714
00:59:01,968 --> 00:59:05,063

你这是在干什么?

整个早上你都没有出门 福尔摩斯先生
You haven't been out this morning Mr. Holmes

731
00:59:56,484 --> 00:59:59,506
不做一个侦探 也能看这位年轻女士

732
00:59:59,581 --> 01:00:01,692

一碗热汤真是个好主意

Mrs. Hudson will you vanish?

742
01:00:37,883 --> 01:00:40,872
他没有什么前途
He had few prospects.

743
01:00:40,946 --> 01:00:43,057
当我来到伦敦

744
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:44,346
参加去年的社交季

746
01:00:47,138 --> 01:00:51,764
我没有意识到自己让他有多伤心
I didn't realize how much I hurt him.

747
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:53,945
他退回了我的信
He returned my letters

748
01:00:54,026 --> 01:00:55,484
我把它们放进了箱子
and I put them away in a trunk,

749
01:00:55,557 --> 01:00:56,941
一直保管着
which I keep with me.

750
01:00:58,931 --> 01:01:02,370
那些信写了什么?
Now the substance of these letters?

751
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,617
一些蠢话
They're just a little foolish.

752
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:10,889
却足够引起你未婚夫的怀疑?

753

我不敢相信
I cannot believe

760
01:01:36,698 --> 01:01:39,116
她会这样背叛我
she could have betrayed me like this.

761
01:01:42,106 --> 01:01:45,575
这个 Lillie怎么会知道Milverton?
How would this Lillie know about Milverton?

762
01:01:45,612 --> 01:01:52,083
我想她之所以会想到这个主意
I think the idea may have come to her

763
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,673
是因为之前发生在我朋友身上的不幸

Charlotte 她原本要结婚

当她收到信时 Lillie和我都在场

没想到同样的命运会降临到我身上

我的婚礼在18日

01:02:55,373 --> 01:02:58,042

但足够我去和他讨价还价了

787
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,421
我不能空着手去
I cannot approach him empty handed.

01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:34,438

01:03:53,576 --> 01:03:56,042
你必须相信福尔摩斯先生
You must trust Mr. Holmes

794
01:03:56,116 --> 01:03:57,360
和他的方法
and his methods.

795
01:03:57,438 --> 01:03:58,790
完全地信任
Absolutely.

796
01:03:58,865 --> 01:04:01,153
Hudson太太会送你出门
Mrs. Hudson will see you out.

797
01:04:11,736 --> 01:04:13,395
那位年轻女士 福尔摩斯
That young lady, Holmes,

798
01:04:13,476 --> 01:04:15,942
显然得到了极大的关照
must be treated with infinite care

799
01:04:16,015 --> 01:04:18,303
一点都不像你最近其它的恶作剧
unlike your other recent escapade.

800
01:04:18,381 --> 01:04:20,077
华生
Oh Watson,

801
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,422
她能独自前来已经是鼓足了勇气
it took some nerve for her to come here alone.

802
01:04:27,844 --> 01:04:29,753
我相信Eva小姐
It is my belief that Lady Eva

803
01:04:29,827 --> 01:04:31,214
和Milverton的侍女
and the Milverton housemaid

804
01:04:31,288 --> 01:04:32,640
有某个共同点
have something in common.

805
01:04:32,714 --> 01:04:33,958
是什么呢?
And what is that?

806
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,839
活力
Juice.

807
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,488
华生 活力
Watson juice

808
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,549
在面对逆境的时候
in the face of adversity.

809
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:46,139
现在 Milverton先生
Now Mr. Milverton.

810
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:04,406
唉呦 唉呦 唉呦
Well, well, well.

811
01:05:09,348 --> 01:05:10,936
Eva?
Eva?

812
01:05:13,314 --> 01:05:14,843
Eva?
Eva?

813
01:05:24,412 --> 01:05:26,000
Eva?
Eva?

814
01:05:30,153 --> 01:05:31,991
Eva?
Eva?

815
01:05:47,965 --> 01:05:49,874
Lottie
Lottie.

816
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,809
真高兴见到你
I am so glad to see you.

817
01:06:01,881 --> 01:06:04,941
巴黎不是答案
Paris wasn't the answer.

818
01:06:05,012 --> 01:06:07,478
找到你真不容易
You've been hard to find.

819
01:06:09,117 --> 01:06:10,575
你在干什么?
What were you doing?

820
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:12,593
我睡着了
I fell asleep.

821
01:06:12,666 --> 01:06:15,406
Johnson告诉了我你叔叔Charles的事
Johnson told me about your Uncle Charles.

822
01:06:15,483 --> 01:06:16,763
我很遗憾
I'm so sorry.

823
01:06:16,841 --> 01:06:20,351
我留在这里是为了安慰Diana 但是...
I stayed here to comfort Diana but

824
01:06:20,424 --> 01:06:23,093
这房子太悲伤了
this house is so sad.

825
01:06:45,856 --> 01:06:48,358
我们6点半再登门
We'll call again at 6:30.

826
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:50,268
C.A.M
C-A-M.

827
01:07:27,638 --> 01:07:28,432
你准备好了吗?
You ready?

828
01:07:28,507 --> 01:07:29,506
是的
Yes.

829
01:07:39,849 --> 01:07:44,012
夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

830
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:53,684
这位先生...这样谨慎吗?
This gentlemen is it discreet?

831
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:59,328
华生是我的朋友和搭档
Dr. Watson is my friend and partner.

832
01:07:59,401 --> 01:08:02,947
纯粹出于对你委托人利益的考虑
It is purely in the interest of your client

833
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:05,130
我表示反对
that I protest it.

834
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:08,366
这件事很棘手
The matter is so very delicate.

835
01:08:08,446 --> 01:08:11,885
华生医生已经想到这点了
Dr. Watson has already thought of that.

836
01:08:14,117 --> 01:08:15,741
请允许我?
May I?

837
01:08:15,822 --> 01:08:18,419
谢谢
Oh thank you.

838
01:08:29,598 --> 01:08:32,302
那我们就来谈买卖吧
Then we may proceed to business.

839
01:08:32,381 --> 01:08:33,804
你在你的留言里说
You said in your note

840
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:37,423
你是Eva女士的全权代表
that you are acting for the Lady Eva,

841
01:08:37,495 --> 01:08:42,325
那你有权接受我的条件吗?
are you empowered to accept my terms?

842
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:48,835
你的条件是什么?
What are your terms?

843
01:08:58,335 --> 01:09:01,430
7000磅?
Seven thousand pounds?

844
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,381
另一种选择呢?
And the alternative?

845
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:05,435
亲爱的先生
My dear sir,

846
01:09:05,472 --> 01:09:08,205
讨论这个我很不好受
it is painful for me to discuss it

847
01:09:08,285 --> 01:09:11,962
但是我可以说
but I can say

848
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:16,729
这是出于极为慎重的考量
that all of this is done with most careful consideration

849
01:09:16,809 --> 01:09:20,972
如果在14日那天没有付钱
and if the money is not paid on the 14th then there certainly

850
01:09:21,052 --> 01:09:23,198
那么18日那天也不会有什么婚礼
will be no marriage on the 1 8th.

851
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:30,086
我们当然熟悉那些信的内容
We are, of course, familiar with the contents of these letters.

852
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:32,455
我们会建议我们的委托人
We shall advise our client

853
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:35,830
把整个故事告诉她未来的丈夫
to tell her future husband the whole story

854
01:09:35,908 --> 01:09:38,505
相信他的宽宏大量
and trust to his generosity.

855
01:09:38,586 --> 01:09:42,713
那你显然是不了解伯爵的为人
Well then you evidently do not know the Earl.

856
01:09:42,796 --> 01:09:45,820
那些信里到底有什么能伤人的地方
What harm is there in these letters?

857
01:09:45,892 --> 01:09:48,489
遣词很活泼
They are sprightly

858
01:09:48,571 --> 01:09:50,444
非常活泼
very sprightly.

859
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,880
女士是位有文笔的写信人
The lady was a charming correspondent.

860
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,101
但是我向你保证Dovercourt伯爵
But I assure you the Earl of Dovercourt

861
01:09:55,181 --> 01:09:58,276
不会欣赏它们
will fail to appreciate them.

862
01:09:58,347 --> 01:09:59,935
不过 如果你不这么想
However, if you think otherwise,

863
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:01,440
这不过是桩生意
it's purely a matter of business.

864
01:10:01,513 --> 01:10:04,708
如果你认为这对你的委托人是最好的
If you think it in the best interests of your client

865
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:08,292
那掏出那么一大笔钱的确太蠢了
then it would indeed be foolish to pay so large a sum of money.

866
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:10,798
你说得太快了
You go too fast.

867
01:10:10,871 --> 01:10:15,807
在这么一件棘手的事上 我们当然是要尽力避免丑闻
We would certainly make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter.

868
01:10:15,881 --> 01:10:20,079
我肯定你也是这么想的
I felt sure that you see it in that light.

869
01:10:31,154 --> 01:10:32,850
你这该死的
Damn you.

870
01:10:34,181 --> 01:10:37,205
Eva小姐不是个富有的人
Lady Eva is not a wealthy woman.

871
01:10:37,277 --> 01:10:38,521
2000英镑
Two thousand pounds

872
01:10:38,599 --> 01:10:41,694
是她所有的积蓄
would be total drain on her resources.

873
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:45,345
你说的那个数字她完全负担不起
The sum you named utterly beyond her power.

874
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,921
让我们以这个价钱赎回信吧
Return the letters at the price we indicate,

875
01:10:49,001 --> 01:10:50,459
我向你保证
I assure you,

876
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:53,626
这是你能拿到的最高价
it is the highest you can get.

877
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:56,687
你说那是小姐的所有积蓄也许是真的
What you say maybe true of the lady's resources

878
01:10:56,759 --> 01:10:59,391
但是一旦结婚
but the surely the occasion of her marriage

879
01:10:59,473 --> 01:11:02,094
不正是她的朋友和亲人
is it not a proper time for her friends and relations

880
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:04,968
助她一臂之力的时候吗?
to make some little effort on her behalf?

881
01:11:08,657 --> 01:11:13,307
他们可能正犹豫送什么结婚礼物
They may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present

882
01:11:13,388 --> 01:11:16,483
但是这一扎信
but this little bundle of letters

883
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:18,049
带了的余兴
would bring more joy

884
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,073
将远多于伦敦所有的宴会
than all the candelabras and butter dishes in London

885
01:11:21,147 --> 01:11:22,806
不是吗?
wouldn't it?

886
01:11:24,486 --> 01:11:26,668
这不可能
It is not possible.

887
01:11:26,748 --> 01:11:28,135
啊 天哪
Oh dear me then.

888
01:11:28,209 --> 01:11:29,833
真是不幸啊
How very unfortunate.

889
01:11:29,913 --> 01:11:36,616
我觉得小姐们都被糟糕地建议 不要去做什么尝试
I cannot help feeling that ladies are ill advised in not making an effort.

890
01:11:40,907 --> 01:11:42,455
看看这个
Look at this.

891
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:45,979
这个属于...
This belongs to,

892
01:11:49,361 --> 01:11:54,222
也许不该告诉你们这是属于谁的
well perhaps it's hardly fair to tell you to whom it belongs

893
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:57,594
直到明天早上它们到女士的丈夫手中
until tomorrow morning when it will be in the hands of the lady's husband.

894
01:11:57,676 --> 01:12:01,431
只是因为她筹不到这么一点小钱
And all because she will not find a beggarly sum

895
01:12:01,503 --> 01:12:03,554
原本是很容易办到的事
which she could easily do

896
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:06,997
只要把她的一些钻石换成人工珠宝的就行
simply by turning some of her diamonds into paste.

897
01:12:07,069 --> 01:12:08,978
多么可惜啊!
It is such a pity!

898
01:12:09,052 --> 01:12:11,103
你或许在最近的晨报上
You may have noticed a small paragraph

899
01:12:11,174 --> 01:12:14,091
注意到一篇短讯
recently in the Morning Post.

900
01:12:14,167 --> 01:12:15,661
尊贵的Miles小姐和Dorking上校
The sudden end of the engagement

901
01:12:15,732 --> 01:12:19,132
突然终止了彼此的婚约
between the Honorable Miss Miles and Colonel Dorking?

902
01:12:19,211 --> 01:12:22,472
是啊 真是个不幸的结局
Yes and it's tragic consequences.

903
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,423
你也可以把它称为谋杀
You can almost call it murder.

904
01:12:24,499 --> 01:12:28,389
你怎么回应此事呢 Milverton先生?
How do you answer for that Mr. Milverton?

905
01:12:28,465 --> 01:12:30,267
在那种情形下
How a man conducts himself

906
01:12:30,343 --> 01:12:32,110
一个人做出怎样的行为
under such circumstances

907
01:12:32,188 --> 01:12:35,283
都是他自己的决定
is a matter for himself alone.

908
01:12:35,353 --> 01:12:37,297
那是不义之财!
That is a monstrous accession.

909
01:12:37,371 --> 01:12:38,686
是你
It was you

910
01:12:38,763 --> 01:12:41,229
你一个人害死了他
and you alone who caused his death.

911
01:12:41,303 --> 01:12:44,813
就为了那点钱
And the sum involved niggardly.

912
01:12:44,886 --> 01:12:47,590
确实才1200磅
Indeed a mere twelve hundred pounds

913
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:49,328
就可以解决所有的问题
would have settled the whole questions.

914
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:52,218
很可惜 不是吗?
Pitiful isn't it?

915
01:12:52,296 --> 01:12:54,347
但是我发现福尔摩斯先生
And yet I find you Mr. Holmes,

916
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:55,556
作为一个明白人
a man of sense,

917
01:12:55,636 --> 01:13:00,760
居然拿你们委托人全部未来和荣耀 和我谈条件
boggling over terms when the whole future and honor of your client is at stake.

918
01:13:00,797 --> 01:13:02,984
你让我很吃惊 真的很吃惊
You surprise me. You do really.

919
01:13:05,864 --> 01:13:08,853
找不到那么多钱
The money cannot be found.

920
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:13,881
最好你接受我们提出的价钱
Surely it would be better for you to take the substantial sum we offer

921
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,080
而不是毁了她的前程
than to ruin this young woman's career,

922
01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:18,106
不然什么也得不到
which can profit you in no way.

923
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:20,848
那你就错了
But you're mistaken.

924
01:13:20,927 --> 01:13:24,604
曝光此事会间接使我
An exposure would profit me indirectly

925
01:13:24,685 --> 01:13:26,796
受到很大的益处
to a considerable degree.

926
01:13:26,877 --> 01:13:28,821
我还有八件 十件
I have eight or ten

927
01:13:28,894 --> 01:13:31,954
类似的事情要去谈
similar cases materializing.

928
01:13:32,025 --> 01:13:37,545
要是Eva小姐的不幸能成为事例流传开
If it is circulated that I have made a severe example of Lady Eva.

929
01:13:37,627 --> 01:13:39,429
会使其余的人
I'll shall find the rest

930
01:13:39,505 --> 01:13:41,486
更理智一些
much more open to reason.

931
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:43,396
你们明白我的意思了?
Do you see my point?

932
01:13:53,282 --> 01:13:55,986
我们来看看这些信的内容
Let us see the contents of those letters.

933
01:14:05,285 --> 01:14:06,649
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

934
01:14:06,686 --> 01:14:10,681
福尔摩斯 我以为你会做些有创意的事情
Mr. Holmes I've been expecting you to do something original.

935
01:14:10,718 --> 01:14:13,242
这早就司空见惯了
This has been tried so often before.

936
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:15,669
小Edward Kroft就是其中一个
Young Edward Kroft for one.

937
01:14:16,174 --> 01:14:17,348
Kroft?
Kroft?

938
01:14:17,427 --> 01:14:19,573
那个男仆Veitch
The footman Veitch

939
01:14:19,653 --> 01:14:22,155
替你挡下了本该射向你的子弹
who took the bullet that was rightfully yours.

940
01:14:22,228 --> 01:14:24,279
你调查过我
You've done some work on me.

941
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:25,583
那你一定知道
So you must know

942
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,656
没有什么能靠近伤害我
that nothing ever came of an attack on my person.

943
01:14:28,733 --> 01:14:30,429
我武装到了牙齿
I'm armed to the teeth

944
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:33,045
一直是这样
at all times

945
01:14:33,116 --> 01:14:35,512
无时无刻不准备着使用武器
and I'm perfectly prepared to use my weapons

946
01:14:35,586 --> 01:14:38,919
我知道法律会保护我
and knowing that the law will support me.

947
01:14:40,945 --> 01:14:43,550
你或许有机会来检验一下这套理论
You may well have your chance to test your assumption.

948
01:14:50,721 --> 01:14:53,294
Hudson太太 别让人来打扰我
Mrs. Hudson I am not to be disturbed.

949
01:14:53,365 --> 01:14:54,265
走吧
Go.

950
01:14:58,652 --> 01:15:00,629
福尔摩斯 你不会真认为
Mr. Holmes surely you don't believe

951
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:04,323
我会傻到把谋生的东西随身携带吧?
I'd be so foolish to carry my livelihood here in my pocket?

952
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:07,091
只是为了确认一下 Milverton先生
Just making sure Mr. Milverton.

953
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,391
那么 现在 先生们
Well now gentlemen,

954
01:15:12,464 --> 01:15:17,019
我今晚还有一两个小约会
I have one or two little interviews this evening

955
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:20,044
从这到Hampstead还很远
and it's a long drive to Hampstead.

956
01:15:46,419 --> 01:15:52,219
有人给了Milverton一点教训
Now someone has dealt Milverton a blow.

957
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:59,006
一个愤怒的丈夫
An outraged husband

958
01:15:59,082 --> 01:16:02,555
和其余在这个灰暗的城市里数以千计人一样
just as there are thousands in this grey city

959
01:16:02,631 --> 01:16:06,177
盼着Milverton去死
who crave Milverton's destruction

960
01:16:06,249 --> 01:16:08,574
或许会先我们一步
and may yet beat us to it.

961
01:16:13,415 --> 01:16:15,324
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

962
01:16:15,398 --> 01:16:18,244
我和任何人一样爱好艺术
I'm as fond of art as any man

963
01:16:18,321 --> 01:16:20,918
但是你不认为在昨天的谈话之后...
but don't you think after yesterday's encounter...

964
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:24,604
艺术离不开头脑
Art is bond to the brain

965
01:16:24,687 --> 01:16:28,269
特别是在做决定的时候
especially in moments of decision.

966
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:30,938
我们了解了一些Milverton的情况
So we've learned something about Milverton.

967
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:34,139
他的残忍无情很难被曝光
That he's ruthless is hardly a revelation.

968
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,535
他的虚荣
And that of his vanity

969
01:16:35,611 --> 01:16:39,624
就是他的弱点
and to a certain his vulnerability.

970
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:42,253
被砍坏的马车
I can see that the damage to his carriage

971
01:16:42,326 --> 01:16:43,950
也许让他有些不安
might have unsettled him.

972
01:16:44,031 --> 01:16:46,427
我们一定要利用这些事
We must exploit such things.

973
01:16:46,501 --> 01:16:47,878
肆无忌惮的蓄意破坏
Wanton vandalism.

974
01:16:47,914 --> 01:16:49,786
"盔甲上出现了裂缝" (他的防备有了漏洞)
Any chink in the armor.

975
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:53,834
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes

976
01:16:53,911 --> 01:16:55,440
这是我的朋友
this is my friend

977
01:16:55,511 --> 01:16:57,349
尊敬的Charlotte Miles
the Honorable Charlotte Miles.

978
01:16:57,424 --> 01:16:58,633
这为是夏洛克福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

979
01:16:58,712 --> 01:17:00,787
和他的搭档华生先生
and his partner Mr. Watson.

980
01:17:00,869 --> 01:17:04,024
Eva小姐能和您单独谈谈吗?
Lady Eva may speak privately to you?

981
01:17:12,767 --> 01:17:14,640
Miles太太
Mrs. Miles

982
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:17,312
请接受我们的慰问
please accept our sympathy.

983
01:17:17,394 --> 01:17:18,923
福尔摩斯先生和我
Mr. Holmes and I

984
01:17:18,995 --> 01:17:20,904
都知道您的情况
are fully aware of your situation.

985
01:17:20,977 --> 01:17:22,744
很感谢你 华生医生
That is most kind of you Doctor Watson

986
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:26,331
但人要带着自己的错误活下去
but one has to live with one's mistakes.

987
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:30,780
他不肯让步
He was unyielding.

988
01:17:36,145 --> 01:17:38,256
现在 下一步
Now the next move

989
01:17:38,337 --> 01:17:41,527
需要你完全的配合
requires your delicate cooperation.

990
01:17:41,608 --> 01:17:43,031
我会按你说的做
I'll do anything you say Mr. Holmes.

991
01:17:43,104 --> 01:17:45,215
舞会在哪天?
The dance in your honor?

992
01:17:45,296 --> 01:17:47,205
14号
On the 14th.

993
01:17:54,828 --> 01:17:59,418
下午好 Stokes先生?
Good afternoon Mr. Stokes?

994
01:18:03,768 --> 01:18:05,392
我说过别让人打扰我 姑娘
I told you I was not to be disturbed girl

995
01:18:05,473 --> 01:18:07,311
什么事?
what is it?

996
01:18:07,387 --> 01:18:11,349
夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生想见你
It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes to see you sir.

997
01:18:11,422 --> 01:18:15,834
"Aggie 我被你打动了"
"Oh Aggie, you've touched my heart."

998
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,048
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

999
01:18:17,128 --> 01:18:18,337
我是来通知你
I'm here to inform you

1000
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:21,783
我的委托人已经接受了你的条件
that my client accepts your terms.

1001
01:18:21,859 --> 01:18:25,499
她的做法是明智的
She's acted with perspicacity.

1002
01:18:25,582 --> 01:18:27,764
她有个小小的请求
She begs but a small favor.

1003
01:18:27,843 --> 01:18:29,123
是什么?
What is it?

1004
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,181
她想把交易延迟到15号进行
That the exchange be delayed until the 1 5th.

1005
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:34,619
在它前一天晚上 伯爵安排了一个舞会
The Earl has arranged a dance for the previous night

1006
01:18:34,862 --> 01:18:39,313
她需要专注于那事
and she is somewhat preoccupied with that.

1007
01:18:37,202 --> 01:18:39,313
舞会 是的
The dance yes.

1008
01:18:39,394 --> 01:18:42,869
那第二天的10点
So 1 0 o'clock the following morning

1009
01:18:42,942 --> 01:18:44,923
我们交易 行吗?
we can do business?

1010
01:18:44,995 --> 01:18:46,169
7000英镑?
Seven thousand pounds?

1011
01:18:46,247 --> 01:18:47,871
对
As agreed.

1012
01:18:47,952 --> 01:18:51,071
在这还是在贝克街?
Here or at Baker's Street?

1013
01:18:51,153 --> 01:18:52,540
这里或贝克街
Here, Baker Street.

1014
01:18:52,613 --> 01:18:56,396
也许找一个中立的地方
Neutral ground perhaps.

1015
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:58,456
Diogenes俱乐部
The Diogenes club

1016
01:18:58,528 --> 01:19:00,401
你是它的会员吧?
you are a member?

1017
01:19:02,772 --> 01:19:05,891
可以吗?
May I?

1018
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:09,092
告诉我这种突然的转变
Tell me this sudden turnabout

1019
01:19:09,174 --> 01:19:12,127
是你的建议吗?
was it on your advice?

1020
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:16,232
我不能让我的委托人听天由命
I could not abandon my client to her fate

1021
01:19:16,306 --> 01:19:19,708
Milverton先生 你胜利了
Mr. Milverton. You are the victor.

1022
01:19:23,924 --> 01:19:26,070
真是天赐的芳香
What a divine fragrance.

1023
01:19:35,927 --> 01:19:39,538
我去世的丈夫和我 就是她第二个家
My late husband and I were something of a second family to her

1024
01:19:39,615 --> 01:19:41,726
所以你明白我的忧虑了?
so you see my concern?

1025
01:19:43,998 --> 01:19:46,667
那个勒索她的人?
This man who is blackmailing her?

1026
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:49,178
Charles Augustus Milverton
Charles Augustus Milverton

1027
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:51,717
他是个画商
he's an arts dealer.

1028
01:19:51,791 --> 01:19:53,143
是的
Yes.

1029
01:19:53,217 --> 01:19:55,363
我听说过他
I've heard of him.

1030
01:19:55,444 --> 01:19:57,282
他收集流言
He's well placed to hear the gossip

1031
01:19:57,358 --> 01:19:59,990
然后作恶
and do his worst.

1032
01:20:00,071 --> 01:20:02,431
福尔摩斯先生怎么想?
What view does Mr. Holmes take of it?

1033
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:06,468
他自有主张
Well I'm sure he has something in mind

1034
01:20:06,541 --> 01:20:08,200
但是他经常是最后才让我知道
but he seldom confides in me till the last minute.

1035
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:12,134
福尔摩斯
Awe Holmes.

1036
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:17,217
Swinstead女士很关心这件事
Lady Swinstead is fully primed for the situation.

1037
01:20:17,292 --> 01:20:21,146
时间快没有了
Time is running out

1038
01:20:21,223 --> 01:20:23,796
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

1039
01:20:23,867 --> 01:20:26,677
要是钱有问题...
If it is a question of paying the money...

1040
01:20:26,754 --> 01:20:28,450
那没必要
That will not be necessary.

1041
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:30,960
那你能保证了?
You can give assurance then?

1042
01:20:31,034 --> 01:20:33,915
这么说可能有点轻率 Swinstead夫人
That would be unwise in me Lady Swinstead

1043
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:36,801
但是我向您保证
but I assure you

1044
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:39,997
我会尽我所能
I will give it my best.

1045
01:20:40,079 --> 01:20:43,139
那样我会很满意
I shall have to be satisfied with that then.

1046
01:20:47,838 --> 01:20:49,594
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

1047
01:20:51,769 --> 01:20:56,113
这个人一定要闭嘴
This man must be silenced.

1048
01:21:05,337 --> 01:21:07,104
她知道Milverton吗?
Does she know about Milverton?

1049
01:21:07,181 --> 01:21:08,425
他的名字?
A name?

1050
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:10,411
是的  我告诉她了
Yes I told her.

1051
01:21:10,485 --> 01:21:12,159
我错了吗?
Was that wrong of me?

1052
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:17,122
华生 这些钱
Oh Watson these bills,

1053
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,109
必须要付
they must be paid.

1054
01:21:19,183 --> 01:21:20,842
顺便说一句 我确保了我们
Oh, incidentally I managed to secure

1055
01:21:20,922 --> 01:21:23,803
都被邀请去参见Dovercourt的舞会
an invitation for us both to the Dovercourt dance.

1056
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:26,311
虽然离伦敦有点远
The house is some miles from London

1057
01:21:26,385 --> 01:21:29,176
但是离我的目标近了
but in reach for my purposes.

1058
01:21:30,142 --> 01:21:31,636
什么目标?
What purposes?

1059
01:21:31,707 --> 01:21:37,123
我要在那天晚上 潜入Milverton家偷窃
I intend to burgle the Milverton house that night.

1060
01:21:37,204 --> 01:21:38,627
天啊 福尔摩斯
For heaven sakes Holmes

1061
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,015
想想你在干什么!
think what you're doing.

1062
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:48,500
让我们好好地想清楚
Well let us look at it fairly and clearly.

1063
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:49,933
你得承认
You will admit

1064
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:53,266
这件事从道义上来说是正义的
that the cause is morally justifiable.

1065
01:21:53,346 --> 01:21:54,354
是的
Yes.

1066
01:21:54,425 --> 01:21:55,962
在法律上是犯罪
Technically criminal.

1067
01:21:56,547 --> 01:22:00,083
不过是像抢他的钱包
No more than raiding his pockets ,

1068
01:22:00,121 --> 01:22:03,285
你那时就愿意帮我
a cause which you were perfectly willing to help me.

1069
01:22:03,321 --> 01:22:04,482
那时事出突然
That was on the spurt of the moment

1070
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,832
不是理智的
not on the coal light of reason.

1071
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:07,309
理智?
Reason?

1072
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,055
这件事里有"理智"的用武之地吗 华生?
Is there reasoning to be done Watson?

1073
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:14,493
没有一样要我动脑子
Nothing to test my brain?

1074
01:22:14,569 --> 01:22:16,098
可恶
That's the curse of it.

1075
01:22:16,169 --> 01:22:18,351
想想
Think.

1076
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:23,646
要是你被抓了
If you're caught,

1077
01:22:23,718 --> 01:22:25,247
这份令人尊敬的事业
an honored career

1078
01:22:25,318 --> 01:22:27,500
就会彻底完蛋 在公众前颜面丢尽
ending in failure and public disgrace.

1079
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,682
什么完蛋 什么丢脸
What failure? What disgrace?

1080
01:22:28,718 --> 01:22:30,674
能比得上被打败?
Against defeat.

1081
01:22:31,511 --> 01:22:33,562
你再了解我不过
You know me well enough

1082
01:22:33,633 --> 01:22:37,180
如果有别的可能
that I would never adopt so objectionable a course

1083
01:22:37,251 --> 01:22:38,745
我是不会出此下策
if another were possible.

1084
01:22:38,816 --> 01:22:40,891
我必须拿到那些信
I must have those letters.

1085
01:22:40,974 --> 01:22:43,998
我对那房子了如指掌
And have the house in the palm of my hand.

1086
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:47,130
先动手再动脑
The cudgel before the brain.

1087
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,309
那讨厌的Milverton呢?
What of the odious Milverton?

1088
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:55,813
难道他会敞开大门请你大摇大摆进去吗?
Do you think he's just going to open his gates and invite you to stroll in?

1089
01:22:55,850 --> 01:22:58,675
Milverton会去舞会
Milverton will be at the dance

1090
01:22:58,751 --> 01:23:01,253
作为Eva小姐的客人
as the guest of Lady Eva's.

1091
01:23:01,326 --> 01:23:04,421
太荒谬了 福尔摩斯
That's monstrous Holmes.

1092
01:23:04,492 --> 01:23:06,958
我赌上了自尊和名誉
My self-respect and reputation are at stake

1093
01:23:07,032 --> 01:23:08,905
这是唯一的办法
it's the only way.

1094
01:23:08,979 --> 01:23:10,437
我不喜欢这样
Well I don't like it,

1095
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:12,039
一点也不
any of it.

1096
01:23:26,165 --> 01:23:28,146
没什么可怕的
You have nothing to fear.

1097
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,580
Eva?
Eva?

1098
01:23:55,841 --> 01:23:59,767
Hudson太太  谁让你给我整理的?
Mrs. Hudson why did you tidy for me?

1099
01:23:59,842 --> 01:24:01,858
我的鞋呢?
Where the hell are my shoes?

1100
01:24:30,179 --> 01:24:31,210
鞋?
Shoes?

1101
01:24:31,292 --> 01:24:32,086
是的
Yes.

1102
01:24:32,162 --> 01:24:33,300
面具?
Masks?

1103
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:34,660
黑丝手绢
Black silk handkerchief.

1104
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,938
我看你天生就会这些事
I see you have a natural turn for this sort of thing.

1105
01:24:36,975 --> 01:24:38,804
我也很纳闷自己怎么学来的

只要你马上离开
Leave the room at once

1177
