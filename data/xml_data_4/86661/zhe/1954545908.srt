1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,700

2
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,600

3
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,600

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,082
一个秋天的星期二早晨
One Tuesday morning in autumn

5
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:12,690
八点半整
at precisely half past eight,

6
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:15,716
歇洛克・福尔摩斯收到了一条神秘字条
Sherlock Holmes received a mysterious message

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,906
两位身世显赫的人
that two men of great public distinction

8
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:19,785
在完全保密的
would be visiting Baker's Street

9
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:22,080
情况下
in their private capacity

10
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,750
乘坐他们的私人马车
and under circumstances

11
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,462
正赶往贝克街
of complete secrecy.

12
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,574
第二块血迹
The Sencond Stain

13
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:12,161
福尔摩斯 他们到了
Holmes, they're here.

14
00:02:49,828 --> 00:02:51,497
简短的说 福尔摩斯先生
In brief, Mr. Holmes.

15
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,375
一份文件
A document has been stolen

16
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,045
从我的私人公文箱中被偷了
from my private dispatch box

17
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:56,401
当我发现了失窃
and when I discovered my loss,

18
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,757
已是今天早晨八点
which was at eight o'clock this morning,

19
00:02:57,862 --> 00:02:59,427
我立即报告了首相
I at once informed the Prime Minister.

20
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:00,992
根据他的建议
It was at his suggestion

21
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,808
我们俩来找你
that we both come to you.

22
00:03:03,913 --> 00:03:05,478
你们已经报警了吗
You have informed the police?

23
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,356
没有先生 我们还没有那么做
No sir, we have not done so,

24
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:10,173
并且我们也不可能那样做
nor is it possible that we should do so.

25
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:12,364
从长远角度来看 让警方知道
To inform the police must, in the long run,

26
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,243
意味着公诸于众
mean to inform the public.

27
00:03:14,243 --> 00:03:15,077
那是我们
And that is what we

28
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:17,372
极其要避免的
particularly desire to avoid.

29
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:19,042
为什么 先生
And why, sir?

30
00:03:19,251 --> 00:03:21,129
因为那文件在一定程度上
Because the document in question

31
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:23,215
是如此的重要
is of such immense importance

32
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,406
以至于它的发表
that its publication might very easily,

33
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:27,284
我是说可能
I might almost say probably,

34
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,788
很容易导致
lead to European complications

35
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:32,084
欧洲的极度混乱
of the utmost moment.

36
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:34,171
追回文件一事
Unless its recovery is attended

37
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:36,048
必须绝对保密
by the utmost secrecy,

38
00:03:36,153 --> 00:03:38,657
否则也就毫无必要
then it may as well not be recovered at all,

39
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:40,222
因为盗窃文件的目的
for all that is aimed at

40
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,787
正是为了
by those who have taken it

41
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,083
公布
is that its contents

42
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,691
文件的内容
should be generally known.

43
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:49,821
我明白了
I understand.

44
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,743
华生
Watson,

45
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,516
请坐下吧
do sit down.

46
00:03:58,064 --> 00:04:00,672
现在 催罗尼・侯普先生
Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope,

47
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,863
如果您能告诉我
I'd be much obliged if you would tell me

48
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:05,263
这文件丢失时的确切情形
the exact circumstances

49
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:08,185
我将不胜感激
under which this document disappeared.

50
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,376
作为欧洲事务大臣
As Secretary of State for European affairs,

51
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:12,567
我在六天前收到了一封信
I received the letter six days ago.

52
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,653
它是一位外国君主寄来的
It was a letter from the foreign potentate

53
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,427
你知道的
you understand.

54
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:17,574
它非常重要
It was of such importance

55
00:04:17,575 --> 00:04:19,035
我从不敢把它放在我的保险柜中
that I never left it in my safe,

56
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,122
而是每天从办公室
but I have taken each evening from my office,

57
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:23,000
带回到我在白厅住宅街的家中
back to my house in Whitehall Terrace,

58
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,253
并且把它放在我的卧室中
and kept it in my bedroom,

59
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:26,235
锁在文件箱里
locked in my dispatch box.

60
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,321
你确定昨晚它是在里面吗
And you are sure it was there last night?

61
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:29,782
是的 我很肯定
Yes, I'm quite certain of that fact.

62
00:04:29,782 --> 00:04:31,555
实际上我打开了文件箱
I actually opened the dispatch box

63
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:32,703
在我晚饭前穿衣时
while I was dressing for dinner,

64
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:34,895
我看到文件在里面
and I saw the letter inside.

65
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:37,190
然后它一直在我旁边的桌子上
It then remained upon my bedside table.

66
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,277
我和我妻子睡觉都很轻
Both my wife and I are light sleepers

67
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:41,050
并且发誓肯定
and are prepared to swear that no one

68
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,407
那晚没人进入房间
could have entered the room during the night.

69
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,850
然而今早那文件却不见了
And yet this morning the paper is gone.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,502
你什么时候吃的晚饭
What time did you dine?

71
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,527
七点半
Seven-thirty.

72
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,823
过了多长时间你去睡觉的
How long was it before you went to bed?

73
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:56,388
我妻子去看戏了
My wife had gone to the theatre.

74
00:04:56,388 --> 00:04:57,431
我一直坐在外屋等她
I had waited up for her.

75
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:00,979
到十一点半我们才回屋睡觉
It was eleven-thirty before we went our room.

76
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:03,378
那么在四个小时中
So for four hours

77
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:05,987
文件箱是没人看管的?
the dispatch box had lain unguarded?

78
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:08,386
福尔摩斯先生 从没人被允许进那屋子
Mr. Holmes,no one is ever permitted to enter that room

79
00:05:08,387 --> 00:05:09,430
除了女仆早晨去过
save the housemaid in the morning,

80
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,621
和我的仆人其他时间去过
and my valet during the rest of the day.

81
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:13,499
他们都是值得信任的仆人
They are both trusty servants

82
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:15,690
给我们工作了很多年
who have been with us for many years.

83
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:17,569
同时
Besides,

84
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,029
他们不可能知道
neither of them could have possibly known

85
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:21,220
在我的箱子中有比一般文件
that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary

86
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,306
都贵重的东西
departmental papers in my box.

87
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:25,080
确信你的妻子知道吗
Surely your wife knew?

88
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:26,646
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

89
00:05:26,646 --> 00:05:27,898
我知道
I have long known how high

90
00:05:27,898 --> 00:05:30,610
侯普先生有很强的社会责任感
Mr. Hope's sense of public duty.

91
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,010
我确信在这件重要的事中
I am convinced that in the case of this importance

92
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,783
信件的保密工作会重于
it would rise superior to the most

93
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:37,079
家庭感情
intimate domestic ties.

94
00:05:37,184 --> 00:05:40,209
承蒙您过奖了 首相先生
You do me no more than justice, Prime Minister.

95
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:42,400
直到今早我都未向妻子
Until this morning I have never breathed one word

96
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,591
提起过这件事
to my wife upon this matter.

97
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,574
在英格兰
Who is there in England

98
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:49,286
谁还知道这封信的存在
who did know the existence of this letter?

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,643
昨天通知了各位内阁大臣
Each member of the Cabinet

100
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:51,790
有这样一封信
was informed of it yesterday

101
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:52,938
每天内阁会议都会
but the pledge of secrecy,

102
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,608
强调保密
which attends every Cabinet meeting,

103
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,381
特别是首相
was increased by the solemn warning

104
00:05:56,382 --> 00:05:58,260
郑重地提醒了大家
given by the Prime Minister.

105
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,555
我的天啊
My God,

106
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:02,120
一想到几个小时中
to think that within a few hours

107
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,893
我就弄丢了它
I myself should have lost it.

108
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,675
除了内阁成员们
Besides the members of the Cabinet

109
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:11,615
还有两人
there are two,

110
00:06:11,615 --> 00:06:12,449
可能有三个
possibly three,

111
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,284
官员
departmental officials

112
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:14,118
知道这信
who know of the letter.

113
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:17,040
我可以保证在英国再没其他人了
No one else in England, I assure you.

114
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,710
国外呢
But abroad?

115
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:20,483
我相信国外没人
I believe that no one abroad

116
00:06:20,484 --> 00:06:21,318
看过这信
has seen the letter

117
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:22,361
除了写信的人
except the man who wrote it.

118
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:24,866
我深信写信的人
I am well convinced that his ministers

119
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,535
他没有通过一般官方的渠道
that the usual official channels

120
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:29,039
来处理这封信
have not been employed in this case.

121
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,151
现在 先生 我不得不问一下
Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly

122
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:36,343
那文件是关于什么的
what this document is,

123
00:06:36,656 --> 00:06:38,012
而且它为什么
and why its disappearance

124
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:40,307
会引起严重的后果
should have such momentous consequences?

125
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:42,603
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

126
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,376
那信封薄而长
the envelope is a long, thin one

127
00:06:44,377 --> 00:06:45,942
是浅灰色的
of pale blue color.

128
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:47,611
用红蜡封着
There's a seal of red wax

129
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:49,802
印有蹲着的狮子
stamped with a crouching lion.

130
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:52,724
收信人的地址是黑色的手写体
It is addressed in large, bold handwriting...

131
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,080
确实很有趣
Interesting and indeed

132
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,166
这些细节同样重要
essential as these details are,

133
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:59,401
我必须知道更根源的事情
my inquiries must go more to the root of things.

134
00:07:00,758 --> 00:07:02,740
那是封怎样的信
What was the letter?

135
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,244
那是政府的最高机密
That is a State secret of the utmost importance,

136
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:06,808
我们不能告诉你
which we cannot tell you,

137
00:07:06,913 --> 00:07:09,104
并且我看那也不必要
nor do I see that it is necessary.

138
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,608
如果能通过你的能力
If by the powers which you are said to possess

139
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:14,739
找到我描述的信
you can find such an envelope as I describe

140
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:15,886
连同它的附件
with its enclosure

141
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,703
你将得到国家的奖赏
then you will have deserved well of your country,

142
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:20,686
同时得到我们权限内
and earned any reward,

143
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,233
任何的报酬
which it is within our power to bestow.

144
00:07:27,468 --> 00:07:30,180
先生们
Gentlemen,

145
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,163
你们是这个国家中
you are two of the most

146
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:34,458
最忙碌的两个人
busy men in the country

147
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,918
我这个小侦探也很忙
and in my own small way

148
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,840
有很多人来找我帮忙
I have a good many calls upon me.

149
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:41,970
很遗憾在这件事上
I regret exceedingly

150
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,996
我没办法帮你们
that I am unable to help you in this matter,

151
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,979
在目前的情形下
and any continuation of this interview

152
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,691
这次见面是在浪费时间
would be a waste of time.

153
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:54,595
从没人这样对我说话
I am not accustomed sir to such things.

154
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:12,646
亲爱的福尔摩斯先生
Dear Mr. Holmes,

155
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,984
我们必须得接受你的要求
we must accept your terms.

156
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:17,236
毫无疑问你是对的
No doubt you are right,

157
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:19,635
只有完全信任你
and it is unreasonable for us to expect you

158
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,766
你才能展开工作
to act unless you have our full confidence.

159
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,061
我同意你 首相先生
I agree with you, Prime Minister.

160
00:08:25,062 --> 00:08:26,731
那么我将告诉你
Then I will tell you,

161
00:08:26,731 --> 00:08:29,339
完全相信你
relying entirely upon your honor

162
00:08:29,444 --> 00:08:31,843
和你的同事 华生先生的荣誉
and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson.

163
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:35,078
我也信任你们有强烈的爱国心
I must appeal to your patriotism also,

164
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,225
因为我不敢想象
for I cannot imagine

165
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,938
一旦事情暴露
a greater misfortune for this country

166
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:42,173
我们的国家将遭受多么大的灾难
than that this affair should come out.

167
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:44,885
您可以放心地信任我
You may safely trust us.

168
00:08:58,241 --> 00:08:59,075
那封信
The letter, then,

169
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:02,518
来自一位外国君主
is from a certain foreign potentate

170
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,397
他对我国殖民地的迅速发展
who has been ruffled by some recent

171
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:07,631
感到愤慨从而写了这封信
colonial developments of this country.

172
00:09:07,735 --> 00:09:08,882
信是匆匆写成的
It is written hurriedly

173
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:11,595
且完全出于他个人的意见
and upon his own responsibility entirely.

174
00:09:11,596 --> 00:09:12,952
于此同时
At the same time

175
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,873
这封信写得很不合体统
it is couched in so unfortunate a manner

176
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:18,065
它的发表无疑
that its publication would undoubtedly

177
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:20,986
会激怒英国人
lead to the most dangerous feeling in this country.

178
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,386
它会引起轩然大波
There would be such ferment, sir

179
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:25,577
我敢说
that I do not hesitate to say

180
00:09:25,577 --> 00:09:26,516
这封信如果发表
that within a week

181
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,289
在一个星期内
of the publication of this letter

182
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,463
这个国家将卷进战争中
this country would be involved in a great war.

183
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:33,924
正是这封信
And it is this letter,

184
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,115
将意味着花费
which may well mean the expenditure

185
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:39,975
几亿英镑
of a thousand million pounds

186
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:41,645
和几十万
and the lives

187
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,836
人民的牺牲
of a hundred thousand men.

188
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:53,956
你通知写信的人了吗
Have you informed the sender?

189
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,773
已经发了密码电报
A cipher telegraph has been dispatched.

190
00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:02,199
或许他希望信被发表
Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.

191
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:04,495
不 医生 我们有足够的理由相信
No, Doctor, we have strong reason to believe

192
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:06,790
他已经感到了
that he already understands that he has

193
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,398
自己的急躁与不谨慎
acted in an indiscreet and hotheaded manner.

194
00:10:09,398 --> 00:10:11,589
如果信被发表
It would be a far greater blow to him

195
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,155
对他自己国家的打击
and his country than to us

196
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:15,137
比对英国的大得多
if this letter were to come out.

197
00:10:16,076 --> 00:10:17,015
如果这样的话
If this is so,

198
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,206
公布这信将符合哪些人的利益呢
in who's interest is it that the letter should come out?

199
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:22,231
为什么有人会盗窃并发表这封信呢
Why should anyone desire to steal it or publish it?

200
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,631
那样的话 华生医生 
There, Doctor Watson, you take me into the realms

201
00:10:24,632 --> 00:10:28,388
就牵扯到紧张的国际关系了
of high international politics.

202
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:32,143
如果你考虑一下目前欧洲的情况
But if you consider the European situation

203
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:33,291
就不难看出
you will have no difficulty

204
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:35,065
其中真正的动机
in perceiving the motive.

205
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:37,569
整个欧洲是个武装起来的堡垒
The whole of Europe is an armed camp.

206
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:40,073
大不列颠保持中立
Great Britain holds the scales.

207
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,846
如果英国被迫
If Britain were driven into war

208
00:10:41,847 --> 00:10:43,412
与哪个联盟交战
with one confederacy,

209
00:10:43,412 --> 00:10:47,376
必定会使另一个联盟获利
it would assure the supremacy of the other,

210
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,194
无论它们是否参与战争
whether they were joined in the war or not.

211
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:53,115
那么是否是这位君主的敌人
So does the enemies of this potentate

212
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,307
想要得到并发表这封信
who want to secure and publish this letter,

213
00:10:55,411 --> 00:10:56,245
来分裂
so as to make a breach

214
00:10:56,246 --> 00:10:58,019
他的国家和我国
between his country and ours?

215
00:10:58,228 --> 00:10:59,271
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

216
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:01,357
如果这信落入敌人手中
And to whom would the document be sent

217
00:11:01,358 --> 00:11:03,236
他将把它交给谁呢
if it fell into the wrong hands?

218
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,157
给欧洲任何一个国家的一个大臣
To any of the great chancelleries of Europe.

219
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:08,349
或许目前持信的人
It is probably speeding its way thither

220
00:11:08,349 --> 00:11:09,809
正乘火车
at the present instant

221
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,104
火速前往目的地
as fast as steam can take it.

222
00:11:12,835 --> 00:11:15,026
亲爱的朋友 那是你的不幸
It is your misfortune, my dear fellow.

223
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:17,217
谁都不能责怪你
No one can blame you.

224
00:11:17,322 --> 00:11:21,182
你没有疏忽大意
There's no precaution which you have neglected.

225
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,373
但是现在 福尔摩斯先生
But now, Mr. Holmes,

226
00:11:23,478 --> 00:11:26,816
事情你全了解了
you are in full possession of the facts.

227
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:30,259
你认为该怎么办
What course do you recommend?

228
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,433
你认为找不到这封信
You think that if this document is not recovered

229
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,833
会发生战争吗
there will be war?

230
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,379
我觉得很有可能
I think it is very probable.

231
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:44,031
那么 先生 请准备打仗吧 
Then, sir, prepare for war.

232
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:46,431
福尔摩斯先生 很难说找不回来了
That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.

233
00:11:46,432 --> 00:11:48,518
考虑现实情况
Consider the facts.

234
00:11:48,936 --> 00:11:50,814
可以想象那文件
It seems no doubt this document was taken

235
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:51,648
在七点半到十一点半之间
between half past seven

236
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:54,257
已被拿走
and half past eleven yesterday evening,

237
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:55,822
那么它现在会在哪呢
so where can it be now?

238
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:00,308
谁也没有理由扣押这封信
No one has any reason to retain it.

239
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:03,751
它已很快地被
It has been passed from hand to hand rapidly

240
00:12:04,795 --> 00:12:05,734
交到需要它的人手中
to those who need it

241
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,029
或以高价买它的人手中
and who will pay well for it.

242
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,594
我们能有什么机会
What chance do we have

243
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:11,159
找到它或弄清它在哪
to overtake it or even trace it?

244
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:13,559
这超出我的能力范围
It is beyond our reach.

245
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,532
福尔摩斯先生 你说的完全符合逻辑
What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes.

246
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:26,705
我感到我们确实无能为力
I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.

247
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,105
同时 侯普
Meanwhile, Hope,

248
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,609
我们不要因为这件不幸的事
we cannot ignore all our other duties

249
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:34,739
而忽略了其他职责
on account of this one misfortune.

250
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,251
今天如果有新的进展
Should there be any fresh developments

251
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:44,338
我们会告诉你
during the day we will communicate with you

252
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:46,633
你也务必让我们了解
and you no doubt will let us know

253
00:12:46,634 --> 00:12:49,242
你调查的结果
the results of your own inquiries.

254
00:12:49,242 --> 00:12:50,702
谢谢
Thank you.

报纸

261
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:42,454
情形令人绝望
The situation is desperate,

262
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,062
但不是完全没有希望
but not hopeless.

263
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,297
只有三个人
There are only three men

264
00:13:48,401 --> 00:13:50,174
敢冒这么大危险
capable of playing so bold a game

奥波尔斯坦 拉若泽和艾秋阿多・卢卡斯
Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas.

266
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,661
甚至是现在 如果我们知道
Even now, if we could be sure

267
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:57,165
是谁拿了信
which one of them has taken it,

有可能的话
it is just possible

269
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:01,130
他们还没有把信出手
that it has not passed out of their hands.

270
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,216
这只是钱的问题
It's a question of money with these fellows,

271
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,782
不是吗
isn't it?

272
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,868
我们有英国财政部的支持
Well we have the British Treasure behind us.

如果他肯出价 我就会买下它
Oh if it's on the market I'll buy it

274
00:14:08,956 --> 00:14:11,668
不管花多少钱
if it means another penny on the income tax.

275
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:13,233
请进
Come in.

276
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:14,902
打扰你了 福尔摩斯先生
Excuse, Mr. Holmes.

277
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,781
哈德森太太 有什么事
Mrs. Hudson, what is it?

278
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:21,476
希尔达・崔洛尼・侯普小姐
Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope,

279
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,815
请她进来

280
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:33,474
福尔摩斯先生 我丈夫来过这儿吗
Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?

281
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,769
是的 女士 他来过
Madam, yes he has been here.

282
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,604
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

283
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:37,961
我请求您
I implore you

284
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,839
不要告诉他我来过
not to tell him I came here.

285
00:14:40,257 --> 00:14:41,509
夫人
Your ladyship puts me

286
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,865
您令我很为难
in a very delicate position.

287
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:43,804
请您坐下
I beg of you to sit down

288
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:45,682
并告诉我您有什么请求
and tell me what it is you desire

289
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:48,707
但我不能无条件地答应您一切
but I cannot make you any unconditional promise.

290
00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,507
先生 我将对您开诚布公
Gentlemen, I will speak frankly to you

291
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:55,802
同时期望那将
in the hope that it will induce you

292
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:57,889
使您对我也能坦率
to speak frankly in return.

293
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,696
我和我丈夫在任何事情上
There is complete confidence

294
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:10,096
都完全地互相信任
between my husband and myself

295
00:15:10,097 --> 00:15:12,079
除了一件事
on all matters except one.

296
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,331
那就是政治问题
That one is politics.

297
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:14,687
在这方面他总是守口如瓶
On this his lips are sealed.

298
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:16,148
他从不告诉我任何事
He tells me nothing.

299
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:19,383
现在我知道了
Now, I am aware that there was a most

300
00:15:19,592 --> 00:15:22,409
昨晚我们家发生了一件很不幸的事
deplorable occurrence in our house last night.

301
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:24,913
我知道一份文件丢失了
I know that a paper has disappeared.

302
00:15:24,913 --> 00:15:26,791
但是事关政治
But because the matter is political

303
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:28,356
我丈夫并没有
my husband refuses to take me

304
00:15:28,356 --> 00:15:30,025
对我完全讲清楚
into his complete confidence.

305
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:31,694
这事情非常重要
Now it is essential

306
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,886
非常重要
essential, I say

307
00:15:33,886 --> 00:15:36,181
我应该彻底了解这件事
that I should thoroughly understand it.

308
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:37,850
除了几位政治家之外
You are the only people,

309
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,310
您是唯一
save these politicians,

310
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:40,876
了解情况的人
who know the true facts,

311
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,545
至少我推测是这样
at least I presume you do.

312
00:15:42,546 --> 00:15:45,363
你推测得没错 夫人
You presume correctly, madam.

313
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:47,032
我请求您
I beg you then,

314
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:48,701
告诉我发生了什么
tell me exactly what has happened

315
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,474
可能会导致什么结果
and what it may lead to.

316
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,961
请详细告诉我 福尔摩斯先生
Tell me all, Mr. Holmes.

317
00:15:54,962 --> 00:15:56,631
不要因为怕损失我丈夫的利益
Let no regard for my husband's interest

318
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,465
而不肯告诉我
keep you silent,

319
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:58,300
我向您保证
for I assure you

320
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,865
他早晚会明白
that his interests,

321
00:16:00,074 --> 00:16:01,221
因为只有完全相信我
if he would only see it,

322
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:02,891
他的利益
would be best served by taking me

323
00:16:02,891 --> 00:16:04,769
才能有所保证
into his complete confidence.

324
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,212
是什么文件被偷了
What was this paper, which was stolen?

325
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:11,551
夫人 您所问的是不能说的
Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.

326
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:14,473
你要明白我只能这么做
You must see that this so.

327
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:19,480
您丈夫认为不该让您
If your husband thinks fit

328
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:21,150
知道这件事
to keep you in the dark over this matter,

329
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,089
那么我
is it for me,

330
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:23,549
由于职业的缘故
who has only learned the true facts

331
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,532
才知道的全部真相
under the pledge of professional secrecy,

332
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:28,662
能随便说出来吗
to tell what he has withheld?

333
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,374
不应该问起的
It is not fair to ask it.

334
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:33,461
你必须问他本人
It is he who you must ask.

335
00:16:33,462 --> 00:16:34,818
我问过他了
I have asked him.

336
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:37,322
我是万不得已才来问您的
I come to you as a last resort.

337
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:43,060
您既然不肯告诉我
But without your telling me anything definite

338
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:44,521
能不能帮我一个忙
you may do me a great service

339
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:46,295
给我一点启发
if you would enlighten me on one point.

340
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:47,755
启发是指什么 夫人
What is it, madam?

341
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:54,642
我丈夫的政治生涯是否会
Is my husband's political career

342
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,250
因为这件事受到影响
likely to suffer through this incident?

343
00:16:59,859 --> 00:17:01,528
除非事情处理得当
Well let me say if it is not put right

344
00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:03,615
否则后果非常严重
it may have a very unfortunate effect.

345
00:17:03,615 --> 00:17:05,180
这样
Oh.

346
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,779
还有一个问题 福尔摩斯先生
One more question, Mr. Holmes.

347
00:17:15,197 --> 00:17:17,909
从我丈夫对此事
From an expression which my husband dropped

348
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,100
一显出惊奇开始
in the first shock of the disaster

349
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,708
我就明白因为文件的丢失
I understood that terrible public consequences

350
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,795
会在社会上引起一系列影响
might arise from the loss this document.

351
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:26,987
如果他这么说 我不能否定
If he said so, I cannot deny it.

352
00:17:26,987 --> 00:17:28,552
后果会是什么性质的
Of what nature are they?

353
00:17:28,552 --> 00:17:29,908
又来了
There again

354
00:17:29,908 --> 00:17:30,951
您所问的
you ask me more

355
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,455
我不能回答
than I can possibly answer.

356
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:38,463
那我就不耽误您的时间了
Then I will waste no more of your time.

357
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,158
福尔摩斯先生 我不怪您 
I cannot blame you, Mr. Holmes,

358
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:45,245
讲话过于严谨
for refusing to speak more freely,

359
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,706
而我相信您不会
and you on your side will not,

360
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:48,479
说我的不好
I am sure, think the worst of me

361
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,610
因为我希望分担他的忧虑
because I desire to share my husband's anxieties,

362
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:54,009
即使违背他的意愿
even against his will.

363
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,774
再一次请求您
Once more I beg

364
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:05,173
不要告诉他我来过
you will say nothing of my visit.

365
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,181
我要说
I say,

366
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,729
一位多么出众
what a really remarkable

367
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:15,503
而美丽的女士啊
and beautiful woman.

368
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,198
女性属于你的研究范围 华生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

369
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:22,389
她的真正意图是什么
What did she really want?

370
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:24,580
意图她讲得很清楚
Surely her own statement was clear

371
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:26,563
她的焦虑也很自然
and her anxiety very natural.

372
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,545
想想她的表情 华生 她的举止
Think of her appearance, Watson, her manner,

373
00:18:28,545 --> 00:18:29,484
她压抑着的焦虑
her suppressed excitement,

374
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,049
她的不安
her restlessness,

375
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,718
一再提出的问题
her tenacity in asking questions.

376
00:18:32,719 --> 00:18:34,388
别忘了她是贝尔敏斯特伯爵的
Remember she is the youngest daughter

377
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:35,640
小女儿
of the Duke of Belminster

378
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,683
出身于一个
and comes of a cast

379
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:38,457
不会轻易表露感情的阶层
that does not likely show emotion.

380
00:18:38,457 --> 00:18:40,543
她心里其实很激动
She was certainly much moved.

381
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,631
你当然观察到了 
And you observed, of course,

382
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:45,865
她总是设法背对着阳光
how she maneuvered to have her back to the light.

383
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:47,012
她不希望我们看清楚
She did not wish us

384
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:49,099
她的面目表情
to read her expression too closely.

385
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,291
是的 她特意选择了那个椅子
Yes; she choose that chair in the whole room.

386
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,003
女性的心理活动很难猜测
And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable.

387
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:57,550
你怎能这样轻信呢
I mean, how could build on such a quicksand?

388
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,846
有时她们一个细小的举动包含重大意义
Their most trivial action may mean volumes,

389
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,037
一个发针或一把卷发火剪
or their most extraordinary conduct

390
00:19:02,037 --> 00:19:05,271
就可以显露出她们的反常
may depend upon a hairpin or a curling tong.

391
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:07,358
早上好 华生
Good morning, Watson.

392
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:08,298

You off then?

393

是啊
Yes.

394
00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:16,436
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

395
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:18,001
是不是那三个嫌犯之一
Was one of the agents you spoke of

396
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:19,357
有个叫艾秋阿多・卢卡斯的
called Eduardo Lucas?

397
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:20,191
是的
Yes.

398
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,070
高道尔芬街的?
Of Godolphin Street?

399
00:19:24,783 --> 00:19:25,617
是啊
Yes.

400
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:27,078
你不能去见他了
You'll not see him.

401
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,121
为什么
Why not?

402
00:19:28,122 --> 00:19:30,834
他昨晚在家被谋杀了
He was murdered in his house last night.

403
00:19:38,973 --> 00:19:39,807
说是谋杀吗
Does it say murdered?

404
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:40,850
在维斯特敏斯特被谋杀的
Murdered in Westminster.

405
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:42,833
一位神秘人的罪行
Crime of a mysterious character.

406
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:43,876
艾秋阿多・卢卡斯
Eduardo Lucas,

407
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:45,754
未婚 34岁
unmarried, thirty-four,

408
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,424
因为他的人格魅力
well known in society circles

409
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:49,302
在社会圈子里很有名
on account of his charming personality.

410
00:19:49,302 --> 00:19:51,180
仆人们晚上不在家      总是这样

411
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,014
上年纪的管家

412
00:19:52,015 --> 00:19:53,267
睡在房子顶层 什么也没听到

413
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,101
他们永远听不到

414
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:55,040
午夜前
Just before midnight

415
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,605
警察巴瑞特巡逻路过时
police constable, Barrett,

416
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,171
看到门半开着

看到卢卡斯被刀子扎中了心脏
Found Lucas stabbed to the heart.

418
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,578
让我看看
Awe, let me see.

419
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:08,917
普鲁士匕首
Prussian dagger.

420
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,004
动机不像是抢劫
Robbery does not appear to be the motive.

421
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:13,821
贵重物品没有被动过
Valuable collection untouched.

00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,594
你认为是怎么回事 华生
What do you make of this, Watson?

00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:16,638
是个...
Well it's an...

424
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:18,829
是个惊人的巧合
it's an amazing coincidence.

425
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,229
巧合
Coincidence?

426
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,794
他就是我们刚说过的
Here is one of the three men

427
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:24,046
三个人中最可能
whom we have named

428
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:25,819
登台表演的人
as possible actors in this drama,

429
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,280
正在这场戏
and he meets a violent end

430
00:20:27,281 --> 00:20:28,533
上演的时候
during the very hours we know

431
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,785
他惨死了
that drama is enacted.

432
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:31,245
从情况看多半
The odds are enormously

433
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,227

两件事有联系
The two events are connected

435
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:37,505
一定有联系
must be connected.

436
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:43,765
我们正是要找出之间的联系
It is for us to find the connection.

437
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:45,748
现在警察一定全知道了
By now the police must know all.

438
00:20:45,748 --> 00:20:47,313
不 还没有
No, not at all.

439
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,399
他们只知道在高德尔芬街看到的
They know all they see at Godolphin Street.

440
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,278
他们肯定不知道
They know, and shall know nothing

441
00:20:51,278 --> 00:20:53,051
白厅住宅街的事
of Whitehall Terrace.

442

只有我们全知道

我们的问题
It is with the late Eduardo Lucas

445
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,859
和艾秋阿多・卢卡斯有直接关系
that the solution to our problem lies.

446
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:06,823
事情还没发生就得出结论
But it is a capital mistake

447
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:09,328
这是个极大的错误
to theorize in advance of the facts.

448
00:21:09,328 --> 00:21:11,623
你值班接待客人 我的好华生
You stay here my good, Watson,

449
00:21:11,624 --> 00:21:13,710
我尽量回来和你一起吃饭
I will join you when I'm able.

450
00:22:34,363 --> 00:22:37,284
华生 他们逮捕了仆人
Watson, they've arrested the valet.

451
00:22:37,284 --> 00:22:39,266
雷斯垂德负责这个案子
Lestrade has been put in charge of the case.

452

他像个苍蝇一样到处嗡嗡
He's buzzing around like a blue bottle.

453
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,501
我应该认识到这点
I've got to know him rather well.

454
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:43,544
如果我去和他谈会有帮助吗
Would it help if I spoke to him?

455
00:22:43,544 --> 00:22:45,213
不 不会有帮助
No, no it would not.

456
00:22:45,214 --> 00:22:46,361
这个案子
This is a case where

457
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:47,821
警察对我们来说和对罪犯
the law is as dangerous to us

458
00:22:47,822 --> 00:22:49,178
一样危险
as the criminals are.

459
00:22:49,178 --> 00:22:51,369
我们必须耐心等待
We must be patient and wait.

I don't know. You'll fade away at this rate.

472

福尔摩斯 他们找到凶手了
I say, Holmes, they've found the murderer

473

482
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:44,366
患有危险的长期狂躁症      可怜的女人
a mania of a dangerous and permanent form.        Poor woman

483
00:24:44,366 --> 00:24:45,722
听这个
But listen to this.

484
00:24:45,723 --> 00:24:47,183
一名容貌酷似她的妇女在
The same woman was seen

485
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:48,852
谋杀当晚在高德尔芬街
in the neighborhood of Godolphin Street

486
00:24:48,853 --> 00:24:50,209
被人看到过
on the night of the murder

487
00:24:50,209 --> 00:24:52,191
之后又在查林十字车站
and later made an emotional scene

488
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,547
因举止狂暴被人注意到
at Charing Cross Station.

489
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:55,113
你怎么看
Now what do you think of that?

490
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:56,260
我亲爱的华生
Oh my dear Watson,

491
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:57,930
你真能忍啊
you are so long-suffering,

492
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,703
过去几天我什么都没给你讲
if I've told you nothing over these last few days

493
00:24:59,704 --> 00:25:02,312
因为没什么可说的
it is because there is nothing to tell.

494
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:03,668
现在从巴黎来的这个消息
Even now this report from Paris

495
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,442
同样没什么帮助
doesn't help us much.

496
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:09,302
和卢卡斯的死总还有关系吧
Well surely it's final as regards to Lucas' death.

497
00:25:09,303 --> 00:25:11,076
他的死只是个意外
The man's death is a mere incident

498
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,119
和我们的真正目标
a trivial episode

499
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,415
寻找丢失文件
in comparison with our real task,

500
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:15,667
避免欧洲的一场灾难相比
which is to trace the document

501
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,588
只是小事一件
and save a European catastrophe.

502
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:22,449
如果这封信丢失了
Now if the letter were loose

503
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:26,100
不 不可能丢失
no, it cannot be loose

504
00:25:26,831 --> 00:25:28,083
如果没丢
but if it isn't loose,

505
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,230
信又在哪呢
where can it be?

506
00:25:29,231 --> 00:25:30,170
谁拿着这封信呢
Who has it?

507
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,735
为什么要扣押这封信呢
Why is it held back?

508
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:34,865
如果雷斯垂德在卢卡斯的文件中找到了信
Look if Lestrade found it amongst Lucas' papers

509
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:37,160
他不会傻到向公众公开
he's not such a fool as to announce it.

510
00:25:37,682 --> 00:25:40,186
他会通报局长
He would inform the chief commissioner.

511
00:25:40,395 --> 00:25:41,229
局长
The chief commissioner

512
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:42,482
会通报给内政大臣
would inform the Home Secretary

513
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:43,838
内政大臣最后会告诉首相
and he, in turn, the Prime Minister.

514
00:25:43,838 --> 00:25:46,342
不 不是在卢卡斯的文件中
No it's not among Lucas' papers.

515
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:50,515
但为什么被扣押了呢
But why is it held back?

516
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,915
这才是问题所在
That is the question

517
00:25:52,915 --> 00:25:55,836
像是一把锤头敲击着我的脑袋
which beats in my brain like a hammer.

518
00:25:58,237 --> 00:26:00,428
卢卡斯被杀
Was it a mere coincidence

519
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,097
正是信丢失的那晚
that Lucas should meet his death

520
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:04,601
不会是巧合吗
on the night when the letter disappeared?

521
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:06,374
他拿到信了吗
Did it ever reach him?

522
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,461
她那位疯太太会不会
Has this mad wife of his

523
00:26:08,462 --> 00:26:09,714
带着信回了巴黎
taken it with her to Paris?

524
00:26:09,714 --> 00:26:12,635
如果是这样 会不会是在她巴黎的家里
If so, is it in her house in Paris?

525
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,452
要我去巴黎吗
Shall I go to Paris?

526
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,435
那会惊动巴黎警方的
That would alert the French Police.

527
00:26:17,435 --> 00:26:20,565
人人都在和我们作对
Every man's hand is against us,

528
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,025
而偏偏
and yet,

529
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:28,076
事情又很重大
the interest at stake are colossal.

530
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:35,798
如果我能顺利解决这个案子
Should I bring this to a successful conclusion,

531
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:37,884
那无疑将是
it will certainly represent

532
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:40,284
我事业生涯最大的光荣
the crowning glory of my career.

533
00:26:40,284 --> 00:26:42,579
福尔摩斯 小心
Holmes, look!

534
00:27:07,412 --> 00:27:08,664
谢谢
Thank you.

535
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:12,420
给您 长官
There you go gov.

536
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,359
谢谢
Thank you.

537
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,428
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

538
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,306
华生医生
Doctor Watson!

539
00:27:25,671 --> 00:27:29,009
你们毫无疑问也在调查卢卡斯的案子吧?
You've no doubt been following the Lucas case?

540
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,262
卢卡斯
Lucas?

541
00:27:30,262 --> 00:27:31,514
卢卡斯
Lucas?

542
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:34,331
是啊 名字倒是挺熟悉的
Awe yes, the name does seem familiar to me.

543
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,104
艾秋阿多・卢卡斯
Eduardo Lucas

544
00:27:36,104 --> 00:27:37,773
被发现上周二晚
found murdered last Tuesday night

545
00:27:37,774 --> 00:27:39,339
在高德尔芬的家中被谋杀
at his house in Godolphin Street.

546
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:41,217
一位不同寻常的先生
Rather a distinguished gentlemen.

547
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:42,782
国际政治学学生
Student of international politics

548
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:45,390
有名的语言学家 他们是这样说的
and a remarkable linguist, so they say.

549
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:48,520
实际上是我负责这个案子
I've been in charge of the case, matter of fact.

550
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:50,816
不是个轻松的案子
Not an easy task by any means.

551
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:54,363
有一些很棘手的问题 
Some delicate problems you understand?

552
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:55,928
但在法国同仁的帮助下
But to the aid of our French friends

553
00:27:55,928 --> 00:27:57,075
我会令人满意地
I will be able to bring the case

554
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:59,267
解决这个案子
to a satisfactory conclusion.

555
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:01,353
所有线索又联系了起来
All the loose ends tied up.

556
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,606
我们弄清楚了
Oh we've got it,

557
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:03,962
就像亲眼看到一样
clear as if we'd seen it.

558
00:28:03,962 --> 00:28:05,214
恭喜你 雷斯垂德
Congratulations, Lestrade.

559
00:28:05,214 --> 00:28:06,883
你事业上又一笔功绩
Another feather in your cap.

560
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:07,718
谢谢
Thank you.

561
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,178
是的
Yes indeed.

562
00:28:10,536 --> 00:28:14,083
你走之前 福尔摩斯先生
Oh before you go, Mr. Holmes,

563
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,022
有一件小事
it's a mere trifle,

564
00:28:15,022 --> 00:28:17,317
但是你感兴趣的那类
but the sort of thing you take an interest in

565
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:18,151
怪事
queer, you know,

566
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:20,447
你可能称之为诡异
what you might call freakish.

567
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,221
和主要事实没有关系
It has nothing to do with the main fact,

568
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:23,681
必须亲眼看到才行
can't have, on the face of it.

569
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:25,142
是什么事
What is it, then?

570
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:26,603
如果你们
Well if you gentlemen

571
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,168
愿意来高德尔芬街一下
could come down to Godolphin Street

572
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:29,420
我想在现场解释
I think I could explain it

573
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:31,090
会比较清楚
better on the spot.

574
00:28:31,403 --> 00:28:33,072
可能就几分钟吧
For a few minutes perhaps.

575
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:35,576
太好了 就在拐角那里
Oh good, it's only just around the corner.

576
00:28:37,141 --> 00:28:38,706
谢谢你 车夫
Thank you Cabbie,

577
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,793
不用找钱了
keep the change.

578
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:04,790
就是这里
Here it all is.

579
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:07,190
那个女人看到仆人走了之后
Now the woman must have knocked on the door

580
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,068
她去敲了门
after she saw the valet had gone out.

581
00:29:09,068 --> 00:29:11,572
毫无疑问是出乎意料的拜访
Surprise visit no doubt.

582
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:13,451
卢卡斯让她进来
Lucas let her in.

583
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:14,911
他不能让自己的妻子
He couldn't keep her on the street could he,

584
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,163
留在街上 不是吗
his own wife?

585
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,936
她用法语冲他大喊大叫
She started screaming at him being French.

586
00:29:17,937 --> 00:29:18,980
借过
Excuse me.

587
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,588
说她如何跟踪他
Saying how'd she traced him

588
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:23,467
然后训斥他等等
and reproaching him and so on.

589
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:24,927
他们来到这里
Anyway they came in here

590
00:29:24,928 --> 00:29:27,849
事情总是互相影响
and one thing led to another

591
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,979
匕首就在手边
and with the daggers being so handy

592
00:29:30,979 --> 00:29:32,752
最后的事情发生了
the end came soon.

593
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:34,735
并不是立即死亡的
It didn't happen in an instant though

594
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:37,447
椅子全倒在墙边
for these chairs were swept over to the wall

595
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:39,013
他手里还抓着一把
and he had this one in his hand,

596
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:42,143
似乎他想用椅子挡开匕首
as if he did try to hold her off with it.

597
00:29:42,143 --> 00:29:44,021
是的 雷斯垂德 谢谢
Yes Lestrade, thank you.

598
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:46,733
告诉我有什么怪事
Now tell me about this trifle.

599
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,299
你知道这类犯罪
Well, you know in crimes of this sort

600
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,177
我们会保持现场原状
we keep things in their position.

601
00:29:50,177 --> 00:29:51,220
不准动任何东西
Nothing has moved.

602
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:52,994
派人日夜看守
Officers in charge day and night.

603
00:29:52,994 --> 00:29:54,872
我很主意这点的
I'm always very particular on that point.

604
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:55,706
是的
Oh yes,

605
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:57,898
你的调查总是严谨细微 警探
you're meticulous in your investigations, Inspector.

606
00:29:57,898 --> 00:29:59,150
今早 我们想
Well this morning we thought

607
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,402
应该可以收拾一下了
we could tidy up a bit.

608
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,445
尸检进行完了
Post-mortem over,

609
00:30:01,446 --> 00:30:03,011
证据搜集完了
all the evidence gathered,

610
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,306
调查结束了
investigation complete,

611
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,540
但是 这块地毯
however, this carpet.

612
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,774
它并没有固定在地板上
As you can see it's not been fastened down,

613
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:13,235
只是摆在那里
it's just been laid there.

614
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:15,948
我们碰巧掀了一下地毯
Now we had occasion to raise it.

615
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,765
发现...
And we found...

616
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,435
什么
Yes?

617
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,251
你一百年也猜不出来
You'll never guess in a hundred years

618
00:30:23,252 --> 00:30:25,547
我们发现了什么 福尔摩斯先生
what we did find, Mr. Holmes.

619
00:30:25,547 --> 00:30:27,320
你看见这块血迹了吗
Now you see this stain?

620
00:30:27,321 --> 00:30:29,407
大部分的血迹已经浸透了地毯
Now a good deal of blood must have soaked through,

621
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:30,764
是吧
must it not?

622
00:30:30,764 --> 00:30:32,850
毫无疑问 是的
Undoubtedly it must.

623
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:35,459
你们听到我说在背面相应的地板上
Then you'll be surprised to hear

624
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:39,110
却没有血迹
that there is no stain on the woodwork

625
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:41,302
一定感到奇怪吧
to correspond.

626
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:43,806
没有血迹?
No stain?

627
00:30:45,371 --> 00:30:46,727
可这绝对不可能啊
But there must be.

628
00:30:46,728 --> 00:30:48,084
尽管你说一定有
So you would say.

629
00:30:48,084 --> 00:30:50,170
事实上
Fact remains

630
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,613
没有
there isn't.

631
00:30:57,683 --> 00:31:00,917
地毯上面和下面有同样的血迹
But the under side is as stained as the upper.

632
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,108
一定会留下痕迹的
It must have left a mark.

633
00:31:05,195 --> 00:31:07,803
我来解开谜底
Now I will show you the explanation.

634
00:31:07,804 --> 00:31:09,890
有第二块血迹
There is a second stain,

635
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:13,333
但是和第一块位置不一样
but it does not correspond with this one.

636
00:31:13,542 --> 00:31:14,376
华生医生
Doctor Watson,

637
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:16,776
你能拿起地毯的另一边吗
will you take that side of the carpet?

638
00:31:19,072 --> 00:31:20,637
我们转过来
Now we will move round

639
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:24,184
按照顺时针方向
in an empty clockwise direction.

640
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:32,844
我想知道 福尔摩斯先生
What I want to know is, Mr. Holmes,

641
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:35,348
是谁转动了地毯
who shifted the carpet

642
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,061
以及转动它的原因
and why?

643
00:31:52,251 --> 00:31:53,816
雷斯垂德 谋杀第二天
Lestrade, who was on duty

644
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,841
这里谁负责看守
the day after the murder?

645
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,615
第二天?
The day after?

646
00:31:58,824 --> 00:32:00,076
麦克弗逊
MacPherson.

647
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:01,223
他就在外面
He's out there now.

648
00:32:01,224 --> 00:32:02,371
听我的
Take my advice.

649
00:32:02,372 --> 00:32:03,519
好好审问他
Examine him carefully.

650
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,666
我会的
I'll get him.

651
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,484
别当着我们的面问
Don't do it before us.

652
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:09,675
我们在这里等
We'll wait here.

653
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,161
告诉他你知道有人进来过
Tell him you know someone has been here.

654
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:15,309
给他施压
Press him.

655
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,457
告诉他只有坦白
Tell him a full confession

656
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:18,439
才能绕他不死
is his only chance of forgiveness.

657
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,796
找我说的做
Do exactly as I tell you.

658
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:21,152
天啊 如果他知道什么
By George, if he knows

659
00:32:21,152 --> 00:32:23,134
我一定要问出来
I'll have it out of him.

660
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:28,664
华生 去望风
Watson, quick get the table!

661
00:33:09,043 --> 00:33:10,921
空的
Empty.

662
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:12,381
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

663
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:30,432
这里 警官
In here, Constable.

664
00:33:32,832 --> 00:33:34,501
麦克弗逊
MacPherson.

665
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,587
家里人怎么样
How's the family?

666
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:38,257
很好 谢谢 先生
Very well, thank you sir.

667
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:39,300
好了 快说吧
Well come out with it.

668
00:33:39,301 --> 00:33:40,135
让先生们听听
Let these gentlemen

669
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:43,056
你不可饶恕的罪行
hear of your inexcusable conduct.

670
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,248
我无疑冒犯 先生
Well I meant no harm sir, I'm sure.

671
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:47,334
一位年轻女士来到门前
This young woman came to the door

672
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:50,673
来应聘一个打字员的广告
answering an advertisement about typewriting.

673
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,969
她说找错房子了
It was mistook, the house she said.

674
00:33:53,177 --> 00:33:55,472
正当我们说话时 先生 你知道的
While we were talking, sir, you know how it is?

675
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,829
一个人在外面看守一天
It's a bit lonely when you're out there

676
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:58,394
难免有些寂寞
on duty all day.

677
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:02,150
发生了什么 麦克弗逊
What happened, MacPherson?

678
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,236
先生 我们说到了这场谋杀
Well, sir, we got talking about the crime.

679
00:34:04,237 --> 00:34:06,845
她说她在报纸上读到了
She had read about it in the paper, she said,

680
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,411
想看看案发现场
and wanted to see where it was done.

681
00:34:08,411 --> 00:34:09,454
我觉得让她看看
So I saw no harm

682
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,645
没什么大碍
in letting her have a weak peep.

683
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:14,044
她走到大概门那个位置
She got just about in the door there,

684
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:15,505
看到了地毯上的血迹
spotted that mark in the carpet

685
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:16,757
然后晕倒在地板上
and down she dropped on the floor,

686
00:34:16,757 --> 00:34:17,696
跟死了一样
and lay for dead.

687
00:34:17,697 --> 00:34:19,679
难怪啊
And no wonder.

688
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,957
继续 麦克弗逊
Go on, MacPherson.

689
00:34:23,957 --> 00:34:25,730
我就到拐角的常春藤商店
Well sir, I was away around at the lvy Plant

690
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,338
买了点白兰地 等我拿酒回来的时候
for some brandy, and by the time I had brought it back

691
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:29,904
那位年轻女士...
the young woman had...

692
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:32,199
已经不见了
well she wasn't here anymore.

693
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,285
肯定是她醒了过来自己离开了
She had recovered and was off.

694
00:34:36,268 --> 00:34:37,833
她感到不好意思
Ashamed of herself,

695
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,920
不愿意再见我
and dared not face me.

696
00:34:45,137 --> 00:34:46,806
麦克弗逊
MacPherson,

697
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,101
你动过地毯吗
did you move the carpet?

698
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,918
我只是把地毯摆好了
No sir, I only straightened it out.

699
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,275
她倒在地毯上了
You see she had fell on it

700
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:54,631
而地板又光又滑
and the polished floor being slippery.

701
00:34:54,632 --> 00:34:56,301
记住这个教训 警官
Let that be a lesson to you, Constable,

702
00:34:56,301 --> 00:34:58,492
你骗不了我
that you can't deceive me.

703
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,370
你一定以为你的失职
No doubt that you thought your breach of duty

704
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,935
不会被发现
would never be discovered,

705
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:03,500
可我一看地毯
and yet a mere glance at that carpet

706
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,752
就马上知道
was enough to convince me

707
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:07,464
有人到屋子里来过
that someone had been admitted to this room.

708
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:08,403
这是你的运气
Lucky for you, my man,

709
00:35:08,404 --> 00:35:09,551
没丢什么东西
that nothing's missing.

710
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:12,682
不然你少不了吃苦头的
Otherwise you would find yourself in Queer Street.

711
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,351
就这样吧
That will do.

712
00:35:16,125 --> 00:35:17,794
华生 我们还在这儿干什么
Watson, what are we doing here?

713
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,880
我们在别的地方还有事呢
We have work elsewhere.

714
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:21,550
你事业上又一笔功绩 雷斯垂德
Another feather in your cap, Lestrade.

715
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:23,324
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生
Oh thank you, Mr. Holmes.

716
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:35,635
上帝啊 福尔摩斯先生
Good Lord, Mr. Holmes!

717
00:35:35,636 --> 00:35:36,679
嗨
Hey.

718
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:42,105
解决了吗
Have you solved it?

719
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:44,504
快了 华生 就快了
Hardly, Watson, hardly.

720
00:36:23,422 --> 00:36:26,343
有两位先生想见您 小姐
Two gentlemen wish to speak to you, my lady.

721
00:36:26,865 --> 00:36:28,847
他们没有预约
They do not have an appointment.

722
00:36:28,848 --> 00:36:30,413
他们是谁 贝茨
Who are they, Bates?

723
00:36:30,413 --> 00:36:32,917
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

724
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:35,421
还有华生医生 小姐
and a Doctor Watson, my lady.

725
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:41,055
很好

726
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:42,098
带他们进来
You may show them in.

727
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,394
是的 小姐
Very well, my lady.

728
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:47,210
对不起
Excuse me.

729
00:36:49,193 --> 00:36:52,323
福尔摩斯先生和华生医生 小姐
Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson, my lady.

730
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,332
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

731
00:36:57,332 --> 00:36:58,897
你实在太不公平
This is surely most unfair

732
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:01,088
太不宽厚了
and ungenerous on your part.

733
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,174
我解释过了 我希望
I have desired, as I have explained,

734
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:04,844
我去找你的事要保密
to keep my visit to you a secret

735
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:06,826
可你却到这里来
and yet you compromise me by coming here,

736
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:07,660
借此表明你和我
and so showing that there are

737
00:37:07,661 --> 00:37:09,017
有事务联系
business relations between us.

738
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:10,164
不幸地是 夫人
Unfortunately, madam,

739
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:12,669
我没有别的选择
I have no possible alternative.

740
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:14,651
我受托找回这件
I've been commissioned to recover

741
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:17,260
极其重要的文件
an immensely important document.

742
00:37:19,034 --> 00:37:20,077
只能请求您
I must ask you, therefore,

743
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:21,850
能好心
to be kind enough

744
00:37:21,955 --> 00:37:24,876
把它交给我
to place it in my hands.

745
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,154
你这是在侮辱我 福尔摩斯先生
You insult me, Mr. Holmes.

746
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:30,927
不必摇铃 希尔达夫人
Do not ring, Lady Hilda.

747
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:33,536
如果你合作 我会安排好一切的
If you work with me I can arrange everything.

748
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:35,519
如果不合作 
If you work against me,

749
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,084
我就要揭发你
I must expose you.

750
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,448
你想要吓唬我
You're trying to frighten me.

751
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,370
来到这里威胁一位女性
It's not a very manly thing, Mr. Holmes,

752
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,561
这可不是大丈夫的行为
to come here and browbeat a woman.

753
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:53,151
你说你了解了一些情况
You say you have something to tell me.

754
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,821
很好 我给你五分钟
Very well, I give you five minutes.

755
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:57,325
一分钟就够了 希尔达夫人
One is enough, Lady Hilda.

756
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:00,455
我知道你去过艾秋阿多・卢卡斯那里
I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas,

757
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,228
你给了他这封信
of your giving him this letter,

758
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:04,524
知道你又巧妙地去过那间房子
of your ingenious return to the room

759
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:06,403
就在谋杀后第二天
on the evening after the murder,

760
00:38:06,403 --> 00:38:08,385
还知道你怎么样从地毯下面
and of the manner in which you took this letter

761
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:10,576
隐蔽的地方取走了这封信
from it's hiding place under the carpet.

762
00:38:12,872 --> 00:38:14,124
我一直带着这个
I have kept this because

763
00:38:14,124 --> 00:38:16,210
因为我想也许有用
I thought it might be useful.

764
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:26,748
那个警察认出了你
The policeman recognized you.

765
00:38:30,087 --> 00:38:31,860
再说一次 福尔摩斯先生
Once again, Mr. Holmes,

766
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,095
我告诉你 你疯了
I tell you you're under some absurd illusion.

767
00:38:36,973 --> 00:38:38,851
很抱歉 希尔达女士
Oh I am so sorry, Lady Hilda.

768
00:38:38,851 --> 00:38:40,833
我尽力了
I have done my best,

769
00:38:41,773 --> 00:38:43,859
但我感觉都白费了
but I feel that I'm in vain.

770
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,598
崔洛・尼侯普先生在家吗
Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?

771
00:38:49,598 --> 00:38:52,623
他十二点半回来 先生
He'll be back at half past twelve, sir.

772
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:58,883
还有一刻钟
Then we have a quarter of an hour.

773
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,535
我们就在这里等他
We will wait here.

774
00:39:33,524 --> 00:39:34,984
饶恕我吧 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes.

775
00:39:34,985 --> 00:39:36,550
饶了我吧
Spare me.

776
00:39:36,863 --> 00:39:39,993
看在上帝的份上 别告诉他
For heaven's sake don't tell him.

777
00:39:39,993 --> 00:39:41,140
我是那么爱他
I love him so.

778
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,226
我不愿意给他的生活带来不快
I would not bring one shadow on his life,

779
00:39:43,227 --> 00:39:45,418
我知道这会让他伤透了心的
and this I know would break his noble heart.

780
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,774
我们时间紧迫啊
We have not an instant to lose.

781
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:48,653
信在哪里
Where is the letter?

782
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:55,643
在这儿
Here it is.

783
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,669
我发誓我没看过
I wish to heaven I'd never seen it.

784
00:39:59,191 --> 00:40:00,443
文件箱呢?
And the dispatch box?

785
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:01,277
在我丈夫那
With my husband.

786
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:03,363
他总是随身携带的
Wherever he goes he takes it with him.

787
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:06,076
我们只有几分钟了
We only have a few minutes left.

788
00:40:06,077 --> 00:40:10,250
希尔达夫人 我费了很大力气保护你
Now, Lady Hilda, I'm going far to screen you.

789
00:40:19,536 --> 00:40:20,996
反过来
In return

790
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,666
你得坦白地告诉我
you will spend the time

791
00:40:22,666 --> 00:40:23,918
你干这些不同寻常的事的
telling me frankly the real meaning

792
00:40:23,918 --> 00:40:26,109
真正目的
of this extraordinary affair.

793
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:35,499
那天下午
It was on the afternoon of that day,

794
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,691
可怕的一天
that terrible day.

795
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:39,569
艾秋阿多卢卡被杀的那天?
The day Eduardo Lucas was murdered?

796
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:40,716
是的
Yes.

797
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:42,699
我正准备出去应酬
I was just going out to pay some calls

798
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:45,307
一封机密的信寄来给我
when a confidential note arrived for me.

799
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:47,289
是卢卡斯寄来的
It was from Lucas

800
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,481
让我立即去见他
asking me to visit him urgently,

801
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:51,985
他有一些重要并私密的事情
as he had important and private information

802
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,176
只能对我讲
for my ears alone.

803
00:41:26,938 --> 00:41:30,068
他通过某种手段
He had obtained, in some way,

804
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:31,424
弄到了我的一封信
a letter of mine,

805
00:41:31,424 --> 00:41:32,884
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

806
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:34,241
是在我婚前写的
An indiscreet letter

807
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,432
一封不慎重的信
written before my marriage.

808
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:38,310
愚蠢的信
Foolish letter.

809
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,502
一封感情冲动陷入恋爱的女孩子写的信
Letter of an impulsive, loving girl.

810
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:42,380
我没有恶意
I meant no harm,

811
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,136
可是我丈夫会认为这是犯罪
yet my husband would have thought it criminal.

812
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,387
要是他读了这封信
Had he read that letter

813
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:49,787
他便再也不会信任我了
his confidence would have been forever destroyed.

814
00:41:49,788 --> 00:41:51,144
是很多年前写的了
It's years since I wrote it.

815
00:41:51,144 --> 00:41:53,230
我以为这件事就这样过去了
I thought the whole matter was forgotten.

816
00:41:57,821 --> 00:42:00,742
毫无疑问你写得很好
No doubt you remember to content very well.

817
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:05,855
很轻薄 我得说很轻薄
Very sprightly, I must say, very sprightly.

818
00:42:05,855 --> 00:42:07,002
你的回答很漂亮
You make a charming correspondent.

819
00:42:07,003 --> 00:42:09,402
你想从我得这里到什么 卢卡斯先生
What do you want with me, Mr. Lucas?

820
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,698
我能要回我的信吗
May I have my letter back please?

821
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:14,202
当然 希尔达夫人
Of course you may, Lady Hilda.

822
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:17,750
但这张纸可是很值钱的
But this is a very valuable piece of paper,

823
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,419
你不这么想吗
would you not agree?

824
00:42:19,419 --> 00:42:21,818
我确定如果把它放在你丈夫面前
I'm sure if it was laid before your husband

825
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:25,262
他可不会喜欢这些内容的
he would hardly fail to appreciate the content.

826
00:42:25,784 --> 00:42:27,244
你是个敲诈犯
You're a blackmailer.

827
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,330
是一位商人 希尔达夫人
A businessman, Lady Hilda.

828
00:42:29,436 --> 00:42:32,253
这对我来说只是一笔交易
This is purely a business transaction on my side.

829
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:34,339
我保证我不希望看到
I can assure you I wish no ill

830
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:36,321
你和你丈夫不和
to you or your husband.

831
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:38,095
你想要多少钱
How much money do you want for that letter,

832
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:39,451
卢卡斯先生
Mr. Lucas?

833
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,165
不要提钱 夫人
Let's not speak of money, madam.

834
00:42:42,165 --> 00:42:45,608
我的生意没那么简单
My business is not so simple as that.

835
00:42:49,781 --> 00:42:53,119
钱很容易弄到
Well the matter is an easy one.

836
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:06,579
每晚
Every evening

837
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:09,396
当你丈夫从部里回来的时候
when your husband returns from his ministry

838
00:43:09,918 --> 00:43:10,961
他都会带着
he brings with him

839
00:43:10,962 --> 00:43:13,674
他的私人文件箱
his private dispatch box.

840
00:43:14,196 --> 00:43:15,656
是不是这样
Is that not so?

841
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:17,326
是的
Yes.

842
00:43:17,952 --> 00:43:19,621
他今晚回家时
When he comes home tonight

843
00:43:19,621 --> 00:43:21,186
箱子里会有一封
this box will contain

844
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:22,856
长的蓝色的信
a long, blue envelope

845
00:43:22,856 --> 00:43:24,629
用红蜡封着
sealed in red wax

846
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:27,342
上面是一只蹲着的狮子
with a crouching lion stamped on it.

847
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:30,681
把那封蓝信带给我
Bring me that long, blue envelope

848
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:32,663
连皮带瓤
with its contents

849
00:43:33,394 --> 00:43:35,272
我就会还给你这个
and I will return you this.

850
00:43:35,272 --> 00:43:37,984
可是我丈夫呢
But my husband?

851
00:43:37,985 --> 00:43:39,132
他不会受到伤害的
No harm will come to him.

852
00:43:39,132 --> 00:43:41,010
我向你保证
I can assure you.

853
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:44,767
换到我的立场想想
Put yourselves in my position.

854
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,123
我该做什么
What was I to do?

855
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,461
选择丈夫的信任
Take your husband into your confidence.

856
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:53,531
我不能 华生医生 我不能
I could not, Doctor Watson, I could not.

857
00:43:54,261 --> 00:43:56,973
一方面会导致幸福的毁灭
On the one side seemed certain ruin

858
00:43:57,391 --> 00:43:59,895
另一方面是件可怕的事
on the other, terrible as it seemed

859
00:43:59,895 --> 00:44:01,355
让我去偷丈夫的
to take my husband's paper,

860
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:02,399
的政治文件
in a matter of politics

861
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,382
政治方面我反正不懂
I could not understand it.

862
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:06,155
而爱和信任的重要性
While in the matter of love and trust

863
00:44:06,156 --> 00:44:08,034
我是十分理解的
it was only too clear to me.

864
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,171
是我干的 福尔摩斯先生
I did it, Mr. Holmes.

865
00:44:16,172 --> 00:44:17,632
是我干的
I did it.

866
00:44:18,259 --> 00:44:21,389
我编造了去剧院的故事
I invented a story about going to the theatre.

867
00:46:54,868 --> 00:46:55,702
第二天早晨
The next morning

868
00:46:55,703 --> 00:46:56,955
我发现我只是用新麻烦
I realized I'd only exchanged

869
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:59,146
代替了旧烦恼
one trouble for another.

870
00:46:59,459 --> 00:47:01,128
我跟踪丈夫来到贝克街
I followed my husband to Baker Street

871
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:02,275
然后一个人来见你
and then came to you myself

872
00:47:02,276 --> 00:47:03,319
为了弄明白
in order to understand

873
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,823
这件事的后果
the full enormity of the offence.

874
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:07,284
我是唯一知道
I alone in the world

875
00:47:07,284 --> 00:47:09,370
文件下落的人
knew where the paper was hidden.

876
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,249
我只有一个想法
My whole mind was turned to the one thought

877
00:47:11,249 --> 00:47:12,918
就是把它拿回来
of getting it back.

878
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,048
我所做的
What I did,

879
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,031
他回来了
here he is now.

880
00:47:18,657 --> 00:47:19,700
有什么消息 福尔摩斯先生
Any news Mr. Holmes?

881
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,534
有什么消息
Any news?

882
00:47:20,535 --> 00:47:22,621
有希望了
I have some hopes.

883
00:47:24,082 --> 00:47:25,751
这事事关政治 亲爱的
This is a matter of politics, my dear.

884
00:47:25,752 --> 00:47:27,630
时间不会太长
We shall not be long.

885
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,829
首相和我们一起用午餐
The Prime Minister is lunching with us.

886
00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:36,185
他可以来听听吧
May he share your hopes.

887
00:47:36,185 --> 00:47:38,271
他意志刚强 据我所知
He has nerves of steel and yet I know

888
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,941
他自从这件可怕的事发生后
that he's hardly slept

889
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,507
几乎没睡过觉
since this terrible event.

890
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,219
福尔摩斯有些事要告诉我们 先生
Mr. Holmes has some news for us, sir.

891
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,662
你有什么好消息 福尔摩斯先生
What have you to report, Mr. Holmes?

892
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:50,062
目前还没有弄清
Purely negative as yet.

893
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,210
我都调查过了
I have made inquiries

894
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,775
对于任何有可能的地方
at every point where it might be,

895
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:54,235
我敢肯定不必担心
and I'm sure there's no danger

896
00:47:54,236 --> 00:47:55,592
有危险
to be apprehended.

897
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,304
这可不够 福尔摩斯先生
That's not enough, Mr. Holmes.

898
00:47:58,931 --> 00:48:00,704
我们不能永远活在火山顶上
We cannot live on this volcano.

899
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:03,313
我们要把事情弄清楚
We must have something definite.

900
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,129
我觉得找到信还是很有希望的
I have high hopes of getting the letters back.

901
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,799
这就是我在这里的原因
That is why I'm here.

902
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,052
我越想
The more I think of it

903
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,617
越觉得
the more I am convinced

904
00:48:10,617 --> 00:48:12,495
这封信根本没离开过您家
that the letter has never left this house.

905
00:48:12,495 --> 00:48:13,329
真的吗 福尔摩斯先生
Oh really, Mr. Holmes.

906
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:14,998
可是为什么会有人拿走文件
But why should anybody take it in order

907
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:15,833
只是为了藏在家里?
to keep it in this house?

908
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,232
我不觉得有人拿走了它
I'm not convinced that anybody has taken it.

909
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:19,798
福尔摩斯先生 这个玩笑可不合时宜
Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill timed.

910
00:48:19,798 --> 00:48:22,197
我可以肯定有人拿了
You have my assurance it was taken.

911
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,058
你从上个周二起
Have you examined the box carefully

912
00:48:26,058 --> 00:48:27,414
仔细地检查过箱子吗
since last Tuesday morning?

913
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:28,458
没有
No not thoroughly.

914
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:30,544
我觉得没有必要
I did not consider it necessary.

915
00:48:31,484 --> 00:48:32,840
你很可能
You could conceivably

916
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,779
没看到那封信
have overlooked the letter.

917
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:35,031
这不可能 先生
That is impossible, sir.

918
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:37,117
这种事我见多了
I have known such things happening.

919
00:48:37,118 --> 00:48:38,161
你的箱子里还有别的文件吗
You have other papers in the box?

920
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:39,935
是的 所有我的私密文件
Yes, all my confidential papers.

921
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,978
可能和别的浑在一起了
It could have got mixed with them.

922
00:48:40,979 --> 00:48:41,813
那封信在最顶上
It was on the top.

923
00:48:41,813 --> 00:48:42,856
箱子可能被摇晃过
The box could have been shaken.

924
00:48:42,857 --> 00:48:44,109
我都摆好的
I had everything out.

925
00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:45,882
很容易整理的
It's easily settled.

926
00:48:45,882 --> 00:48:47,655
咱们去看看吧
Let's go and look.

927
00:48:49,221 --> 00:48:52,142
这绝对是在浪费时间
This is a farcical waste of time,

928
00:48:53,186 --> 00:48:54,542
不过
but still,

929
00:48:54,855 --> 00:48:56,524
如果没有什么别的事能让你满意
if nothing else will satisfy you,

930
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:57,672
就去看看吧
it shall be done.

931
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,062
这都是我的私密文件
Here are all my confidential papers

932
00:49:07,063 --> 00:49:08,523
如你所见
as you can see.

933
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,218
这是梅罗爵士的信
It's a letter from Lord Merrow,

934
00:49:13,532 --> 00:49:15,410
查理斯・哈迪伯爵的报告
report from Sir Charles Hardy,

935
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,183
贝尔格雷地的备忘录 这是
memorandum from Belgrade, that's the one

936
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:19,478
我们今早在讨论的文件 首相
we were discussing this morning, Prime Minister,

937
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:22,505
俄国和德国的粮食税记录
note on the Russo-German grain taxes,

938
00:49:22,505 --> 00:49:24,070
马德里的来信
letter from Madrid,

939
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:26,052
弗拉沃爵士的记录
note from Lord Flowers...

940
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:44,206
是的 就是它
Yes, this is it.

941
00:49:48,484 --> 00:49:51,927
信完好无损
And the letter is intact.

942
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,179
太神奇了
Remarkable.

943
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:55,058
难以置信
This is inconceivable.

944
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:56,727
不可能 福尔摩斯
Impossible, Mr. Holmes.

945
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,500
希尔达
Hilda?

946
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,795
你怎么知道它在这儿
How did you know it was here?

947
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:04,865
因为我知道不在别的地方
Because I knew it was nowhere else.

948
00:50:05,283 --> 00:50:07,787
我不敢相信我的眼睛
I cannot believe my eyes!

949
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:09,873
希尔达 我们找到信了
Hilda, we have found the letter

950
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:11,438
我知道
and I know it is difficult

951
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:12,482
你很难理解这种事
for you to understand

952
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:16,342
但这是最好的消息
but it is the most wonderful news.

953
00:50:17,386 --> 00:50:19,472
非常不同寻常
It's quite extraordinary.

954
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:21,350
我把每个文件都翻过了
I went through every paper in here.

955
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,542
我检查又检查
I checked and I rechecked.

956
00:50:23,542 --> 00:50:25,628
不可思议 它就在里面
It's incomprehensible that I should have overlooked it

957
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:27,297
我竟然没看到它
in this manner.
