1
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,668
不要啊
Yelling No.

2
00:00:30,913 --> 00:00:34,247
不要 不 不 不
No. No. No. No.

3
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:08,477

4
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:21,341

5
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:37,444

6
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:53,519
这样看上去精神病院像消失了一样
It's as if the asylum had vanished.

7
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,788
但不幸必然还在那些高墙后面上演
The misery that must behind those walls.

8
00:01:57,697 --> 00:02:01,370
精神上的恐惧是无从逃离的
There's no escape from the terrors of the mind.

9
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,652
没错
Indeed.

10
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,477
又了结了一起案子
Well another case concluded.

11
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,271
我本不必离开贝克街的
[unintelligible]

12
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:15,629
这样的案子连一个善于观察的孩子都能解决
An observant child could have solved it.

13
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:50,427
祝你的研讨会顺利  谢谢你
Good Luck with the seminar and thank you.

14
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:51,986
这是个殊荣 亲爱的朋友
It's a privilege my dear fellow

15
00:02:52,025 --> 00:02:54,407
毕竟我们成功地破了案
if it's a successful case after all.

16
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,245
福尔摩斯
And Holmes,

17
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,060
别感到无聊哦
don't be bored.

18
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,942
Glovin城堡
Glovin castle.

19
00:03:53,187 --> 00:03:54,544
Glovin
Glovin.

20
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,014
它太美了 Robert
It's so beautiful Robert.

21
00:03:59,455 --> 00:04:02,438
我从没想过它有这么美
I never expected it to be so beautiful

22
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:05,594
它真的一直都是你们家的吗?
and it's really always belonged to your family?

23
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:08,172
大概有四五百年了吧
For about 4 or 5 hundred years or so.

24
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:21,892
我想进去看看
I want to see it.

25
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:23,541
不行 Hettie
No Hettie.

26
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,532
怎么不行?
Why can't I see it?

27
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:20,632
亲爱的 你不明白
My darling girl you don't understand,

28
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:22,932
我不可以这么随便地去拜访Glovin
I can't just drop in at Glovin.

29
00:05:23,249 --> 00:05:24,630
你也不行
Neither can you.

30
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:29,440
就算你极可爱又极富有 你还是不可以去那里
You maybe utterly divine and impossibly rich but you can't.

31
00:05:29,481 --> 00:05:31,333
可是为什么我不可以呢?
But why can't I?

32
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:32,753
这城堡是你的啊
You own it,

33
00:05:32,794 --> 00:05:34,760
你是St.Simon勋爵 那是你的房子
you're Lord St. Simon, it's your house.

34
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,556
那是一处祖屋 算在我的名下而已
It's an ancestral home, which is mine.

35
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,477
可是真正住在那里的是些仆人
You see it's the servants who really live there.

36
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:44,195
事实上他们每个人在Glovin住的时间都比我长
Actually every one of them has spent more of their life in Glovin than I have.

37
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,996
而我不想把他们赶出去
And I won't have them put out.

38
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,813
我明白了
I see,

39
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,662
那么就算我们结婚了
so even when we're married

40
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,238
如果我想到那儿去
if I want to visit

41
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:57,096
也得提前禀报?
I have to send on ahead?

42
00:05:57,136 --> 00:06:01,003
是的 提早一两天更好
Yes, preferably a day or two ahead.

43
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:05,891
噢 我真是没想到 一副皇家作派
Oh, I didn't realize, like royalty.

44
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:07,720
是的
Yes.

45
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:17,185
没问题吗 Robert?
Will it be all right Robert?

46
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,291
你说什么呢 亲爱的?
What my darling?

47
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,491
我的身份
That I mind about me at what I am

48
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:23,777
还有我的出身
and where I come from,

49
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:26,546
我是说你的家族和仆人们介意吗?
the servants I mean and your family?

50
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,061
他们已经把你视为一位有异国风情的女子了
They already think of you as being one of the exotic.

51
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:32,694
可我是个矿主的女儿 来自矿区
But I'm a miner's daughter from a mining camp.

52
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,410
尽管我爸爸从那里挖出了金子
Pa might have been digging gold out there

53
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:36,211
可我依然是个矿主的女儿
but it still makes me a miner's daughter.

54
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,295
不要紧的
Doesn't matter.

55
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:38,944
这样的教育对于乡村生活来说堪称完美
Perfect education for the country life,

56
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,146
整个郡都臣服在你脚下
you'll have the whole county at your feet,

57
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:42,794
我也是你的
as you have me.

58
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:50,432
噢 天哪 你看
Oh my, will you look at that.

59
00:06:55,462 --> 00:06:56,720
它在那儿干嘛?
What's it doing here?

60
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,053
在Glovin一直有个类似动物园的地方
There's always been some sort of zoo at Glovin.

61
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:01,455
我的下人一直打理着它
My latter fellow's interest to keep it going.

62
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,779
我一直有个奇特的想法
You know I have a fancy

63
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,063
觉得这美洲豹就像是你
that cat's from the Americas like you.

64
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:13,913
它到这儿欢迎我们了
Actually he's come to welcome here.

65
00:07:13,952 --> 00:07:17,242
你这个狂野又美丽的家伙
You wild and beautiful thing.

66
00:07:17,283 --> 00:07:19,805
它的狂野美丽可不及你的一半
Not half as wild and beautiful as you.

67
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:15,931
水
Water.

68
00:09:17,293 --> 00:09:19,088
洒落尘土的水
Water into dust.

69
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,406
来吧
Come on.

70
00:09:38,022 --> 00:09:41,028
Amelia 让她把狗给我吧
Amelia why don't you let her give the dog to me?

71
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,073
不行 这狗得跟我呆在一起
No, no, she stays with me.

72
00:09:43,113 --> 00:09:45,026
它也许会被马踩到的
She might get under the horses.

73
00:09:45,068 --> 00:09:47,123
我们能到这里简直是奇迹
It's a wonder we got here at all.

74
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:50,932
衣服到了 他们也到了
Its arrived and so have they.

75
00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:54,582
你说了多少?
How much did you say?

76
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:55,753
你说什么?
What did you say?

77
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,992
他们曾把孩子送到巴黎去
They sent the child to Paris.

78
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,874
去干嘛?
What for?

79
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,452
去上学
To school.

80
00:10:00,491 --> 00:10:04,517
没错 美国人是会把他们的女儿送到巴黎去
Yes Americans do send their daughters to Paris,

81
00:10:04,558 --> 00:10:09,709
- 我是我的印象... - 我表示怀疑
that's what I was given to understand.

82
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:14,931
就我看来 巴黎的空气里 要么洋溢着轻浮 要么充满哲理
You know in my experience Paris breaths either triviality or philosophy.

83
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,561
都对你过日子没有什么用处
Neither helpful companion in life.

84
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:20,627
嗯 没错
No I suppose not.

85
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:23,885
呃 至少这孩子不是个演员
Well at least the child is not an actress.

86
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:25,212
噢 Florence
Oh Florence

87
00:10:33,349 --> 00:10:34,892
噢 Alice Alice Alice
Alice Alice Alice

88
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:37,456
Hettie 她们可是你未来的家人
Now, now Hettie, they're your future family.

89
00:10:37,497 --> 00:10:38,835
她们都想喜欢上你
They want to like you.

90
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:41,496
她们想喜欢Robert勋爵未来的新娘
They want to like Lord Robert's future bride.

91
00:10:41,537 --> 00:10:42,965
别再这么傻了 Hettie
Stop being so silly Hettie.

92
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,564
可是 Alice 难道你没瞧见那些妇人?
Oh Alice, but Alice have you seen those women?

93
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:46,382
好了 Hettie Doran
Now Hettie Doran

94
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:48,155
让我帮你回忆一下
I'd like to remind you of a certain incident

95
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,353
一年多以前 在Tompkins Gulch 发生的那件事吧
which occurred in Tompkins Gulch not 2 years ago.

96
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:52,380
那头熊!
The bear.

97
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,859
Alice 我当时吓死了
Alice I was scared to death.

98
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,836
噢 你吓退了那头熊
Awe, you faced that bear down you did.

99
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:58,397
我告诉你 我当时连动都动不了
I couldn't move I tell you.

100
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:00,113
可是你瞪着它 把它吓退了
You faced him down.

101
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,355
当时你相信自己 于是就做到了
You believed in yourself and you did it.

102
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,353
现在下楼去吧
Now you get down those stairs.

103
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:09,582
我亲爱的Henrietta
My dear Henrietta

104
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,123
你不能住在Glovin
you cannot live at Glovin.

105
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:13,194
为什么?
Why not?

106
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,893
因为Glovin不适合居住
Because Glovin isn't fit for habitation.

107
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,049
可是它真的很完美
But it's just perfect.

108
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:22,230
我们很快就能把它修缮一新
We'll soon get it round.

109
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,442
它是我所见到过的最美的地方了
I say it's the most beautiful place I've ever seen.

110
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:28,222
你难道不记得那些可爱的景象了吗?
Don't you remember how lovely it was

111
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,430
男人们带着镰刀
when all the men came with their scythes

112
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:34,178
到庄园上割草
to mow the hay in the park

113
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,264
还有那些夏夜的聚会?
and the summer parties?

114
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:38,936
房子里里外外的每一盏灯
Every lamp in the house was lit

115
00:11:38,977 --> 00:11:41,142
都点亮了
and outside

116
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:44,166
还有月光下干草的味道
the smell of the hay in the moonlight,

117
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,927
你还记得吧?
you remember?

118
00:11:47,686 --> 00:11:49,346
当然 当然
Yes, yes.

119
00:11:49,337 --> 00:11:51,419
我都还记得呢
I remember.

120

亲爱的歇洛克 福尔摩斯先生

my father has run away. Please will you help me find him?

122
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:45,057
Timothy

我的猫Boswald失踪了
My cat Boswald is missing.

124
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:55,406

125

我来告诉你我是怎么想的

我觉得她漂亮极了
I think she's extraordinarily pretty

127

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,400
而且我觉得Robert爱得神魂颠倒
And I think Robert is head over heels in love.

129
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:19,545
没错
I agree.

130
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,516
我就是这么想的
That's what I think.

131
00:14:21,558 --> 00:14:24,934
Bella也是这么想的 对吧 我的天使?
And Bella thinks so too don't you my angel?

132
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:31,714
Bella说Doran小姐也是个泼辣的女孩
Bella says Miss.Doran is very [unintelligible].

133
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:34,616
泼辣
Very [unintelligible].

134
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:36,197
亲爱的Henrietta
Dear Henrietta

135
00:14:36,526 --> 00:14:39,809
你可别把Amelia的话太过当真了
you mustn't take what Amelia says too seriously.

136
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,970
我一个字儿也没听见
I didn't hear a word of all that.

137
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,997
Robert就应该有你这样的太太 亲爱的
Robert so deserves you my dear.

138
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,405
他在爱情上遭受过不幸
He's been unlucky in love

139
00:14:49,446 --> 00:14:51,566
- 而他的生意... - 嘘
and he's business... Hush,

140
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,766
Mary 记得吗?
Mary, remember?

141
00:14:54,805 --> 00:14:57,595
为什么我就不能把我的话说完?
Why can't I finish what I was going to say?

142
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:59,565
我们什么时候开饭?
When do we dine?

143
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,746
优雅
Exquisite.

144
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,383
优雅
Exquisite.

00:16:09,047 --> 00:16:13,824
这些可怕的事情都是你想像出来的 Oswald
You've merely imagined all these dreadful things Oswald.

150
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:15,803
都是你的想像
It was your imagination.

151
00:16:16,566 --> 00:16:19,068
这种痛苦对你来说太沉重了
This agony's been too much for you.

152
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,417
-你好 福尔摩斯先生 -我可以进去吗?
-Hello Mr. Holmes. -May I?

153
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:23,040
当然了 不过里头在彩排...
Yes but there rehearsing...

154
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:29,408
在家里 跟你的母亲在一起 我亲爱的孩子
At home with your own mother. My blessed boy.

155
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,812
你要什么就有什么
Everything is yours for the asking

156
00:16:32,854 --> 00:16:36,111
就像你小时候一样
just like when you were a little child.

157
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,820
你的发作该结束了

当着陌生人的面我是不彩排的
I will not rehearse in front of strangers.

169
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:35,752
走开
Get over there.

170
00:17:35,795 --> 00:17:37,332

Mind your own business.

174
00:17:54,351 --> 00:17:55,639
不是Robert勋爵送来的
It's not Lord Robert's.

175
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,165
今天可是我们的七周年纪念啊
It's our 7th anniversary isn't it?

176
00:17:58,205 --> 00:17:59,025
七年了

来吧 来找你的婊子吧 我的勋爵大人

你永远不会找到一个像我这样

00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:56,855
能为你做任何事情的人

191
00:19:21,463 --> 00:19:24,613
我不跟你一起喝 那种法国庄园葡萄酒
if I don't join you in drinking that French chateau wine.

192
00:19:24,652 --> 00:19:26,741
对我的口味而言 它太细腻了
I guess it's too refined for my taste.

193
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:28,865
有些人会说是太高级了
Some would say too civilized.

194
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:29,935
为您的健康干杯

带有烟味的威士忌

197
00:19:37,273 --> 00:19:39,306

要是一个人有了固定的口味 为什么还要...

00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:51,582
确实如此...确实如此

00:19:56,866 --> 00:19:58,936
这种酒真是太好了 先生
The wine sir is magnificent.

203
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,205
上帝保佑你

204
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:26,948
你都知道了吧?
You know don't you

205
00:20:26,991 --> 00:20:30,096
我给了Hettie相当可观的一笔钱
I've settled a considerable amount on Hettie

206
00:20:30,136 --> 00:20:31,574
作为她的嫁妆?
for when she's married?

207
00:20:32,553 --> 00:20:34,896
她很清楚您的慷慨 先生
She's very conscious of your generosity sir.

208
00:20:35,582 --> 00:20:36,976
她不止一次地提起过
She's mentioned it more than once.

209
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:38,107
对
Sure.

210
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:40,580
现在跟我说说你的这座房子
Now tell me about this house of yours.

211
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:44,124
是座大房子 可他们告诉我它很阴郁
Great house, sad looking they tell me.

212
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,502
说得不错
I'll accept that

213
00:20:48,354 --> 00:20:50,506
不过我不打算
but I'm not prepared to lay out more

214
00:20:50,546 --> 00:20:52,052
在那里多住
for the time I spend there.

215
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:55,496
Hettie告诉我房子很美
Hettie has told me how beautiful it is.

216
00:20:56,266 --> 00:20:59,142
我想她愿意把它当成自己的一个家
I think she'd like it to be one of her homes.

217
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,746
我非常愿意尽我所能让Hettie开心
I would want to please Hettie in any way I can

218
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:07,478
可我觉得住在Glovin是不可能的
but I'm not sure that living in Glovin is possible.

219
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,618
为什么?
Why not?

220
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,890
您一直对我很坦诚
You've always been very frank with me

221
00:21:18,932 --> 00:21:20,944
所以我得向您承认
so I'll admit something to you.

222
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:23,602
在我更年轻的时候
When I was much younger

223
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,249
那时少不更事
and barely had a grasp of affairs

224
00:21:26,941 --> 00:21:30,794
我得到了一些糟蹋的建议 我是说金钱上
I was very badly advised, financially I mean.

225
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,193
怎么回事?
In what way?

226
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,341
有人说服我卖掉 Glovin的外围部分
I was persuaded to sell off outlying parts of Glovin

227
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,887
结果这处产业就无法 给我带来足够的收入
until there wasn't enough income from the estate

228
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,540
去维持房子的开销
to sustain the house.

229
00:21:42,209 --> 00:21:44,410
接着为了修缮房子我又进行了抵押
Then mortgages were taken out to repair things

230
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,419
这样我的收入就更少了
which left even less income.

231
00:21:46,463 --> 00:21:49,197
没有人警告过你有这样的后果吗?
And nobody warned you of the consequences?

232
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:51,391
我当时很信任我的顾问
I trusted my advisors.

233
00:21:52,746 --> 00:21:55,109
他们也是我父亲的顾问
They were my father's advisors.

234
00:21:57,176 --> 00:22:00,340
当你在像Glovin那样的地方长大
When you grow up in a place a Glovin

235
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,916
你会觉得那种生活会是永久不变的
it seems eternal.

236
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:07,656
是的 我明白
Sure I see that?

237
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,474
我要去休息了 Miller小姐
I'll be off then Miss Miller

238
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:19,296
我希望你也能休息一下
and I hope you'll do the same.

239
00:22:19,336 --> 00:22:22,050
因为你在忙也没意义
Cause there's no point in you doing otherwise.

240
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,778
哦 让我摆脱你这个麻烦的女人吧
Well rid me of this troublesome woman.

241
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,484
-你是我的救世主吗? -我说了 出去

他们的社会地位与我不可同日而语

在教堂外头 我开始觉察她有些不对劲

出现在你家门口

00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:36,094
你和Miller小姐是什么关系吗?
the nature of your relationship with Miss Miller?

473
00:44:36,859 --> 00:44:38,010
可以
Yes.

474
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:40,878
简单地说 她曾是我的情妇
If somewhat naive she was my mistress.

475
00:44:40,922 --> 00:44:42,726
我们几个月前分手了
We parted some months ago.

476

477
00:44:46,339 --> 00:44:48,911
是不是你遇到Doran小姐时候的事?
And that is when you met Miss Doran?

478
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:50,294
事实上 在那之前

479
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:53,306
Miller小姐的酒瘾 之前就曾引起过好几次争吵
Miss Miller's drinking had already led to some scenes.

480
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:56,569
她渐渐变得不可信任

481
00:44:56,887 --> 00:44:58,293
你是否觉得...
Do you think...

482

你是否觉得Miller小姐是那种
Do you think Miss Miller's the sort of person

483
00:45:03,108 --> 00:45:07,325
比起让你难堪 更会向你复仇的人?
to seek revenge on you beyond embarrassing you a bit?

484
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:10,712
酒精对人的影响是难以预料的
Drink affects people unpredictably.

485
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:13,824
苏格兰场的警察也觉得
But the chap at Scotland Yard also believes

486
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,330
Miller小姐与Hettie的失踪有关
Miss Miller to be implicated in Hettie's disappearance.

487

你最好还是应应门吧 先生?

488

我觉得你该看看这个

<i>两位女士Maud和Helena有何关系?</i>

那妇人是位女士

她身上有种东西 我觉得
There was something about her,

496
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:44,865

她可是位女士
She was a lady.

502

00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,710

I know what's on the other side.

630
00:56:05,485 --> 00:56:06,798
对不起 你叫什么?
Excuse me what is your name?

631
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:07,773
Montgomery
Montgomery.

632
00:56:07,817 --> 00:56:09,129
是位巡官
Inspector.

633
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:13,405
噢 一位巡官
Oh an inspector.

634
00:56:13,447 --> 00:56:15,433
这纸片是从一张旅馆账单上撕下来的
This is torn from a hotel bill.

635
00:56:15,476 --> 00:56:18,913
房间 8先令 早餐 2先令6便士
Rooms 8 shillings breakfast 2 and 6.

636
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:21,315
鸡尾酒 1先令 午餐2先令6便士
Cocktails a shilling luncheon 2 and 6

637
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,485
雪利酒一杯 8便士
a glass of sherry, 8 pence.

638
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:24,817
我看过了 没什么
I have looked at that, there's nothing in it.

639
00:56:25,195 --> 00:56:27,457
据我所知
I know very few hotels

640
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,155
没几家旅馆敢对一杯雪利酒收8便士
that would dare to charge 8 pence for a glass of sherry,

641
00:56:31,201 --> 00:56:34,258
不过 巡官
however inspector

642
00:56:35,139 --> 00:56:39,133
我想见见Miller小姐
I would like to interview please, Miss Miller.

643
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,482
欢迎
You're welcome to her.

644
00:56:43,403 --> 00:56:45,005
再见 福尔摩斯先生
Good day Mr. Holmes,

645
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:46,187
再见 华生医生
Doctor Watson,

646
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:47,416
再会
Inspector.

647
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:48,451
祝您走运
Oh and good luck.

648
00:56:48,496 --> 00:56:49,906
祝你走运
Good luck to you.

649
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:54,572
一想到Lastrad
The thought of a Lastrad,

650
00:56:54,617 --> 00:56:57,097
在Levington温泉疗养地逍遥自在
Ioose at Levington Spa

651
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,733
我真希望他太太跟他一起去
I do hope his wife went with him.

652
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:03,057
我需要你那个新潮的烧瓶 还有一小瓶杜松子酒
I need your hip flask and a small bottle of gin.

653
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,000
杜松子酒?
Gin?

654
00:57:09,156 --> 00:57:10,861
那张旅馆账单...
That hotel bill,

655
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:12,446
这个消息
the message,

656
00:57:12,983 --> 00:57:14,776
应该是通过某种方式
it must have been passed some how

657
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:16,749
传递给了在教堂里的Doran小姐
to Miss Doran in the church.

658
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,170
问题一  怎么传递的?
Question one, how?

659
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:22,926
问题二  谁传递的?
Question two, by who?

660
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:25,698
显然就是那个她跑去会面的人
Clearly by the person she went to meet.

661
00:57:25,741 --> 00:57:28,355
-名字缩写是F.M. -Flora Miller
-With the initials 'F.M.' -Flora Miller.

662
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:32,090
不一定
I wonder.

663
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,312
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

664
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:39,742
对Miller小姐的证据是越来越不利了
the evidence is looking increasingly good against Miss Miller.

665
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,777
现在我还得到了这位先生的证词
I now have this gentlemen's evidence.

666
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:43,892
请允许我介绍George Tidy先生
May I introduce Mr. George Tidy?

667
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:45,042
你好 先生
How do you do sir?

668
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:47,950
他是Park俱乐部的老门房了
He's the senior porter at the Park Club.

669
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:51,109
他打算做证说在St.Simon勋爵的婚礼前夜 Miller小姐用一把手枪
He's prepared to testify that Miss Miller took a shot with a pistol

670
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:55,175
朝勋爵开了一枪
at Lord St. Simon on the night before his wedding.

671
00:57:57,275 --> 00:57:59,307
如果属实的话 那就非常有意思了
If true, its most intriguing.

672
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:00,654
噢 千真万确的
Oh it's true all right.

673
00:58:00,696 --> 00:58:02,330
千真万确
Oh it's true all right.

674
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,978
Tidy先生有证据
Mr. Tidy has the proof.

675
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:27,382
子弹
The bullet.

676
00:58:27,424 --> 00:58:28,300
啊
There.

677
00:58:29,034 --> 00:58:31,506
是一把小手枪
A pocket gun wouldn't you say

678
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:33,134
不过不是Miller小姐的
but not Miss Miller's.

679
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,902
不是Miller小姐的?
Not Miss Miller's?

680
00:58:34,943 --> 00:58:37,028
当然不是
No it's certainly not.

681
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,225
能射出会拐弯的子弹的手枪
The gun is yet to be invented

682
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,684
还没发明出来呢 巡官
that can shoot around corners Inspector.

683
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:43,173
-有人在这儿开了一枪 -这是肯定的
-Well someone took a shot here. -Of course they did

684
00:58:43,216 --> 00:58:46,688
Tidy先生  你觉得开枪的是谁?
now Mr. Tidy who do you think attempted this murder.

685
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,033
我不知道 先生
I've no idea sir.

686
00:58:48,379 --> 00:58:51,216
当时周围还有几个人
But there were several other people about.

687
00:58:51,259 --> 00:58:55,768
但是我注意到 枪响的时候
But I noticed that the door of his Lordship's carriage

688
00:58:55,811 --> 00:59:00,596
勋爵的马车门重重地关上了
banged at the same time as the gun went off.

689
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,676
不过真正引起我注意的
But what really alerted me

690
00:59:02,718 --> 00:59:05,242
是弹射出来的石头碎片
was the chips coming out of the stone.

691
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:10,831
于是很自然地我就转过身去
Well naturally after that I had to turn

692
00:59:10,874 --> 00:59:12,582
结果发现她站在那里
and there she was,

693
00:59:12,624 --> 00:59:13,726
就是Miller小姐
Miss Miller I mean,

694
00:59:13,772 --> 00:59:15,546
她生气地瞪着我
staring at me furious.

695
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:18,011
所以你以为是她开了那一枪
As though you thought it was she who had fired the shot?

696
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,283
倒是很自然的事 不过事情不是这样的
Very natural, however it was not.

697
00:59:20,328 --> 00:59:23,969
这事是由一位或几位不知名的人干的
Person or persons unknown.

698
00:59:35,215 --> 00:59:37,168
你它妈是谁?
And who the devil are you?

699
00:59:37,209 --> 00:59:38,334
Miller小姐?
Miss Miller?

700
00:59:41,682 --> 00:59:44,210
我真的知道你不该在这的
I am acutely aware that you should not be here.

701
00:59:44,253 --> 00:59:46,348
很高兴听到你这么说
I'm glad to hear it.

702
00:59:46,392 --> 00:59:49,507
我是歇洛克.福尔摩斯 为您效劳
I'm Sherlock Holmes at your service.

703
00:59:51,452 --> 00:59:54,662
你能为我效劳的 就是去给我弄瓶酒来
Only service you could do me is to be carrying a bottle.

704
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:56,343
华生
Watson.

705
01:00:14,935 --> 01:00:23,671
好啊 你倒是个蛮有教养的人嘛
Well, well what an extraordinary civilized citizen you turn out to be then.

706
01:00:23,712 --> 01:00:29,254
我是来调查St. Simon夫人失踪一事的
I am here to investigate the disappearance of Lady St. Simon.

707
01:00:33,237 --> 01:00:34,859
那孩子只不过是有了常识
The child simply had the common sense

708
01:00:34,901 --> 01:00:36,764
发现了她把自己送上了什么路
to see what she was letting herself in for.

709
01:00:36,809 --> 01:00:39,163
她把自己送上了什么路呢?
And what was she letting herself in for?

710
01:00:39,207 --> 01:00:42,822
和Robert St. Simon一起生活
A life with Lord Robert St. Simon.

711
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:46,558
你能说说那样可能的代价吗?
Can you describe what that might entail?

712
01:00:48,302 --> 01:00:50,373
我把所有的事情都告诉那孩子了
I told the child all about it.

713
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,482
我记不太清了
I can't quite remember.

714
01:01:09,578 --> 01:01:11,822
很漫长的一天
It's been a long day.

715
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,375
我累极了
I was very tired.

716
01:01:18,867 --> 01:01:21,178
天知道我告诉了她什么
God knows what I said to her.

717
01:01:28,746 --> 01:01:30,772
我不记得了
I don't remember.

718
01:01:43,935 --> 01:01:47,187
亲爱的福尔摩斯先生
Dear Mr. Holmes,

719
01:01:48,611 --> 01:01:50,874
我 Agnes Northcote
I Agnes Northcote,

720
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:54,696
神志清醒 身体健康...
being of sound mind and body...

721
01:02:13,847 --> 01:02:17,628
你注意到Hettie Doran小姐离开了房子
You observed Miss Hettie Doran leave the house,

722
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:20,310
你向她做了自我介绍
you introduced yourself to her.

723
01:02:20,356 --> 01:02:22,514
你们一起在公园散步
You walked together in the park.

724
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:25,735
你告诉她要提防St. Simon勋爵
You warned her against Lord St. Simon.

725
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:26,894
没错
Yes.

726
01:02:26,935 --> 01:02:29,519
她有没有试图捍卫Simon勋爵?
Did she try to defend Sir Simon to you?

727
01:02:29,565 --> 01:02:30,070
没有
No.

728
01:02:30,111 --> 01:02:31,825
一点也没有吗?
Not at all?

729
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,747
她就说了句"谢谢你"
All she said was thank you

730
01:02:34,755 --> 01:02:36,784
"这事让我下定了决心"
that has decided me.

731
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,078
噢 继续说吧
Oh, go on.

732
01:02:40,013 --> 01:02:41,235
你把她带回了剧院
You took her back to the theatre

733
01:02:41,277 --> 01:02:43,059
又派人去买了些衣服 是吧?
and sent out for some clothes?

734
01:02:43,104 --> 01:02:44,087
是的
Yes.

735
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:45,321
她身上带了钱吗?
Had she money with her?

736
01:02:45,363 --> 01:02:47,357
没有 衣服的钱是我付的
No, I bought the clothes

737
01:02:47,399 --> 01:02:49,459
我还给了她几个金币
and I gave her a couple of sovereign.

738
01:02:49,503 --> 01:02:51,192
你真是太好心了
That was very good of you.

739
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:52,442
哪里
Not at all.

740
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,824
她说她父亲会偿还这笔钱的
She told me her father would reimburse it all.

741
01:02:54,869 --> 01:02:57,284
她还替我写了张便条给他
She wrote a note to him for me.

742
01:02:57,326 --> 01:02:59,071
啊 一张便条
Ah a note.

743
01:02:59,682 --> 01:03:04,548
你能谈谈St. Simon勋爵之前的几次婚姻吗?
Now can you tell me anything about Lord St. Simon's previous marriages?

744
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:06,547
没什么
Nothing.

745
01:03:06,589 --> 01:03:07,289
没什么?
Nothing?

746
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,824
是没什么 我就为现在而活
Nothing. I live for the present

747
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:10,949
其它的事情都是浪费时间
and nothing else is a waste of time.

748
01:03:10,992 --> 01:03:14,996
你对他第一任妻子的死一无所知吗?
You know nothing about his first wife's death?

749
01:03:15,043 --> 01:03:16,266
是的
Nothing.

750
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:19,025
第二次婚姻被宣布无效
The second marriage was annulled,

751
01:03:19,068 --> 01:03:20,678
你知道为什么吗?
do you know why?

752
01:03:20,722 --> 01:03:21,785
不知道
No.

753
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,935
通常只有当夫妻双方 有一方不适合结婚时
Well an annulment usually takes place

754
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,933
婚姻才会被宣布无效
when there's unfitness in one of the partners.

755
01:03:27,978 --> 01:03:30,089
你知道是怎么回事吗?
Do you know what that might be?

756
01:03:31,118 --> 01:03:32,428
不知道
No.

757
01:03:32,471 --> 01:03:33,718
不知道?
No?

758
01:03:33,763 --> 01:03:35,056
一无所知吗?
Nothing?

759
01:03:35,743 --> 01:03:37,779
是不是他什么都不许你谈?
You're not permitted to discuss anything?

760
01:03:37,822 --> 01:03:38,328
不是的
No.

761
01:03:38,371 --> 01:03:39,528
我可以问问为什么吗?
May I ask why?

762
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:41,130
不行
No.

763
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:47,264
根本没有哪个男人
Not any a man

764
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,142
能配得上这样的爱
should be worthy of such love.

765
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,341
是不是因为激情?
Is it passion?

766
01:03:55,068 --> 01:03:56,377
还是恐惧?
Fear?

767
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:02,538
噢 我明白了 Miller小姐
Oh I see Miss Miller

768
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,465
是兼而有之
it's both.

769
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:11,300
我告诉你
I apprise you I shall do my best

770
01:04:11,342 --> 01:04:12,716
我会尽力确保你
to see that you are released

771
01:04:12,762 --> 01:04:15,927
摆脱这种毫无道理的羁押
from this nonsensible confinement.

772
01:04:15,968 --> 01:04:17,557
Miller小姐
Miss Miller?

773
01:04:47,261 --> 01:04:48,538
我要做
I'll do it.

774
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,806
差不多好了
It is nearly ready

775
01:05:24,617 --> 01:05:27,231
你知道Doran女儿失踪一案
You know the disappearance of Doran's daughter

776
01:05:27,276 --> 01:05:29,691
应该是很简单的
ought to be a simple matter.

777
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,888
无须什么协助 谜底会自动揭开
It should solve itself without further assistance.

778
01:05:35,545 --> 01:05:36,613
可是Robert勋爵呢?
But what about Lord Robert?

779
01:05:36,658 --> 01:05:41,398
他干了什么会招来三个复仇天使
What has he done to warrant 3 avenging angels,

780
01:05:41,866 --> 01:05:43,011
或是女巫?
witches?

781
01:05:43,808 --> 01:05:45,032
女巫?
Witches?

782
01:05:45,931 --> 01:05:50,199
呃 躲在黑暗里的一个女人
Well a woman obscured.

783
01:05:51,332 --> 01:05:53,433
也许时间的进程被调整过了
Perhaps time is shaped.

784
01:05:54,813 --> 01:05:57,095
我们无法梦到未来
We cannot dream the future.

785
01:05:57,139 --> 01:06:01,425
噢 也许未来就在我们身边 我准备好了
Oh maybe the future is all around us, I'm ready.

786
01:06:01,433 --> 01:06:02,768
就来
Coming.

787
01:06:14,558 --> 01:06:17,160
很遗憾里头的线索如此之少
It's a pity there's so little in this.

788
01:06:17,203 --> 01:06:19,280
只有一些数字和缩写字母
Just a few figures and initials.

789
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:22,880
毫无疑问 你会有更多发现的
No doubt you'll find more.

790
01:06:25,976 --> 01:06:27,361
噢 你看
Oh look.

791
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:30,336
好像是蝴蝶脆弱的翅膀
It's like a delicate membranes of a butterfly.

792
01:06:35,404 --> 01:06:37,549
噢 这可怜的女人真是一贫如洗
Oh the poor woman is destitute.

793
01:06:38,482 --> 01:06:40,034
赤贫
Destitute.

794
01:06:43,528 --> 01:06:45,264
书页间充满了愤怒
Ah their's rage on this page.

795
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:48,138
看看她是怎么撕掉这些纸的
Look how she's torn the paper.

796
01:06:51,164 --> 01:06:52,891
噢 这是什么?
Oh what have we here?

797
01:06:53,688 --> 01:06:55,002
一根线
A thread.

798
01:06:56,706 --> 01:06:58,238
是一位女裁缝吗?
A seamstress?

799
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:01,225
还是一个做花边的?
Lace maker?

800
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:05,344
或是一个编织工?
Web maker?

801
01:07:22,179 --> 01:07:24,480
哈 她还爱读书
Ah she reads.

802
01:07:24,522 --> 01:07:29,214
Bronte  Jane Austen 和Sophocles (均为著名作家)

803
01:07:29,258 --> 01:07:30,230
请进
Coming.

804
01:07:35,195 --> 01:07:38,436
戴面纱的女士 她回来了
The woman with the veil, she's back.

805
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:46,774
歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

806
01:07:46,816 --> 01:07:48,673
是的 正是在下
Yes I am he.

807
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,381
我们以前见过
We've met before.

808
01:07:54,315 --> 01:07:56,614
我是Agnes Northcote
I am Agnes Northcote.

809
01:07:56,658 --> 01:07:58,756
Northcote小姐
Miss Northcote.

810
01:07:59,606 --> 01:08:01,248
您有什么要告诉我的吗?
What have you to say to me?

811
01:08:01,295 --> 01:08:02,935
在我告诉您这个之前
Before I can tell you that

812
01:08:02,979 --> 01:08:06,296
我必须先知道 您和St. Simon勋爵有什么关系
I must know your connection with Lord St. Simon.

813
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:06,882
什么关系也没有
None.

814
01:08:06,925 --> 01:08:08,513
华生
Watson?

815
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:11,893
我们在调查他妻子失踪一案
We are investigating his wife's disappearance.

816
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,264
噢 你不该找她
Oh you must not find her.

817
01:08:15,087 --> 01:08:18,221
你这样说得有理由才行
Such an edict requires justification.

818
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:21,867
任何有钱的女人 都逃脱不了他的毒手 相信我
No woman with a fortune is safe from him believe me.

819
01:08:22,648 --> 01:08:23,887
-相信我 -是嘛?
-Believe me. -Really?

820
01:08:23,932 --> 01:08:25,246
可是我的思维
Well I'm afraid I am burdened

821
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:27,572
是很理性的
with a rational turn of mind,

822
01:08:27,612 --> 01:08:29,076
我需要证据
I need proofs.

823
01:08:29,932 --> 01:08:31,566
Northcote小姐 我需要证据
Miss Northcote I need proofs.

824
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:34,158
我没有证据
I have no proof

825
01:08:35,102 --> 01:08:37,102
但是我坚信如此
only my conviction

826
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:39,706
而且还曾经经历过 不只是我的经历
and experiences not just my own.

827
01:08:39,751 --> 01:08:42,084
坚信 那可是难得的东西
Conviction well that's a luxury

828
01:08:42,127 --> 01:08:44,234
我差点都忘了
that I have almost forgotten.

829
01:08:44,277 --> 01:08:46,459
显然你有很多要告诉我们的 Northcote小姐
You clearly have much to tell us Miss Northcote

830
01:08:46,507 --> 01:08:49,130
请坐 请坐下
please, please sit down.

831
01:08:52,833 --> 01:08:56,584
我要说的是关于我姐姐的事
I have about my sister.

832
01:08:57,701 --> 01:09:00,003
我能说说她发生了什么事吗?
Shall I tell you what happened to her?

833
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:02,118
那就是我来这儿的原因
That is why I came.

834
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:05,308
Helena是我见过的人当中
Helena was more alive

835
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:07,848
最有活力的
than anyone I've ever met.

836
01:09:08,058 --> 01:09:09,543
她有她自己的财产
She had her fortune

837
01:09:10,216 --> 01:09:12,735
她的命运掌握在她自己手中 这可是很多女人难得拥有的
she was in charge of her fate, as few women are,

838
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:16,495
直到她遇见了Robert St. Simon勋爵
until she met Lord Robert St. Simon.

839
01:09:17,739 --> 01:09:19,249
他毁了她
He destroyed her.

840
01:09:19,858 --> 01:09:21,238
他夺去了她的财产
He took her fortune,

841
01:09:21,285 --> 01:09:22,982
他娶了她
he married her

842
01:09:23,558 --> 01:09:26,049
又把她毁了
and he destroyed her.

843
01:09:28,169 --> 01:09:29,276
怎么回事?
How?

844
01:09:36,565 --> 01:09:40,280
他让人把她送到一家精神病院里头
He had her committed to a mad house.

845
01:09:40,714 --> 01:09:43,662
只需要两个医生的签名
It required only the signature of 2 doctors

846
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:44,947
这事就办成了
and the deed was done.

847
01:09:44,992 --> 01:09:45,858
那是什么时候的事?
When was this?

848
01:09:45,902 --> 01:09:46,920
现在这样的事情不可能发生的
It could not happen today,

849
01:09:46,964 --> 01:09:48,576
我们有<精神失常判定条例>
we have the Lunacy Act.

850
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,001
噢 不可能吗?
Oh could it not?

851
01:09:51,046 --> 01:09:53,553
呃 也许是吧
Well that's as maybe

852
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:56,322
可是条例的出台对我姐姐来说太迟了
but the act came too late for my sister

853
01:09:56,799 --> 01:10:00,881
当条例实施的时候
and when the Lunacy Act became enforced

854
01:10:02,527 --> 01:10:05,338
他还是让人把她关进了精神病院
he still had her put away.

855
01:10:05,383 --> 01:10:08,399
我们不能随便把人关进精神病院的
People can't just be put away.

856
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:12,242
当然可以 如果你的叔叔是位公爵就行
They can if you're uncle is a Duke.

857
01:10:12,285 --> 01:10:15,343
要是你长得英俊又能花言巧语也行
If you're handsome and plausible

858
01:10:15,386 --> 01:10:18,779
而且是基于你刚才说的条例
under the terms of your precious act

859
01:10:19,176 --> 01:10:22,175
我要求他们对她被关押的情况
I demanded that conditions of her confinement

860
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:26,934
...作出评估  他们也做了
were inspected and so they were.

861
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:31,107
一个小小的学术委员会最终到了Glovin
A small but learned committee went to Glovin eventually.

862
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:33,998
Helen
Helen.

863
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,558
他们知道他们得找什么
Knowing what they wanted to find

864
01:10:35,602 --> 01:10:36,965
当然他们就找到了
and of course they found it.

865
01:10:37,009 --> 01:10:40,545
他们被富有同情心的Robert勋爵迷惑了
Charmed by the compassionate Lord Robert

866
01:10:40,554 --> 01:10:45,314
他把她的妻子关起来 是因为他曾经貌美如花的妻子
who had kept his wife a profoundly depressed person.

867
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:48,176
极度情绪低落 而且令人伤心地迷失了自我
Once beautiful now sadly destructed

868
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:53,730
而他的妻子受到了令人赞叹的照顾 环境干净
in conditions that can only be wondered at for their cleanliness,

869
01:10:53,776 --> 01:10:55,114
整洁
they're orderliness,

870
01:10:55,158 --> 01:10:57,236
看护质量很高等等
their quality of nursing and so on.

871
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:00,829
只有一件事情他们没有注意到
Only one thing was amiss,

872
01:11:00,874 --> 01:11:02,834
那就是那个人不是我姐姐
it was not my sister.

873
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:06,589
Helena并没有疯
Helena was not mad.

874
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:08,790
那人不是她
It was not her.

875
01:11:09,363 --> 01:11:11,290
他雇了别人来冒充她
He'd hired someone.

876
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:13,191
Flora Miller
Flora Miller.

877
01:11:14,665 --> 01:11:16,504
Robert!
Robert!

878
01:11:17,144 --> 01:11:19,025
那不是我姐姐
It was not my sister.

879
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,604
不是她
It was not her.

880
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,461
那她现在在哪儿?
And where is she now?

881
01:11:35,883 --> 01:11:38,139
我自己去了一趟Glovin
I went to Glovin myself.

882
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:42,044
我得查清真相
I had to find the truth.

883
01:11:45,659 --> 01:11:47,557
我的收获就是这个
My reward was this.

884
01:12:22,593 --> 01:12:24,520
Northcote小姐?
Miss Northcote?

885
01:12:26,498 --> 01:12:28,337
你发现真相了吗?
Did you discover the truth?

886
01:12:32,517 --> 01:12:33,607
没有
No.

887
01:12:36,792 --> 01:12:38,601
我不知道该怎么做
I did not know how to.

888
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:44,486
我被愤怒和悲伤蒙蔽了
I was blind with anger and grief.

889
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:50,934
我甚至想不起我是怎么到那儿去的
I have no recollection of even how I got there.

890
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:56,539
我只知道有一天我发现我自己
I only know that I found myself one day

891
01:12:58,324 --> 01:13:02,016
正穿过那个该死的地方 一重重的门
walking through the gates of that accursed place.

892
01:15:51,626 --> 01:15:54,648
我被扔在树林之中
I was left in part of the wood

893
01:15:54,691 --> 01:15:57,046
那是关动物的地方
where the animals are kept

894
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:58,242
那样事情看上去
so it might look as though

895
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,206
就像是我没有听从劝告去了那里
I had been attacked by one of them

896
01:16:00,253 --> 01:16:02,986
而受到了一头动物的袭击
after ignoring notices not to.

897
01:16:11,713 --> 01:16:13,786
我被一些佃农发现了
I was found by some cottagers.

898
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,751
才活了下来
And kept alive.

899
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:22,037
要是您能查出我姐姐是死是活 我将万分感激
I would thank you to find out whether my sister was alive or not.

900
01:16:33,244 --> 01:16:36,432
不查清楚这事
I only live a half-life

901
01:16:37,019 --> 01:16:38,800
我虽生犹死
for not knowing.

902
01:16:40,675 --> 01:16:44,037
没有什么能驱除我心里的阴霾
Nothing seems to break the gray cycle I live in.

903
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:48,405
不管我做什么
Nothing I do.

904
01:16:58,504 --> 01:16:59,913
什么都不行
Nothing.

905
01:17:00,812 --> 01:17:03,844
夜晚我穿过街道
I walk the streets at night,

906
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:08,631
寻找着危险
Iooking for danger.

907
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:17,947
有时我觉得我是在 请求这个世界给予我伤害
Sometimes I think I'm asking the world to hurt me 

908
01:17:18,309 --> 01:17:20,509
好让我觉得我还活着
so I can feel alive.

909
01:17:20,552 --> 01:17:24,864
天哪 我梦见的就是这个啊
Good God what else may I've dreamt?

910
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:27,722
送洗的衣服?
The laundry?

911
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:32,675
Northcote小姐 您能再告诉我一件事吗?
Miss Northcote will you satisfy me upon one point?

912
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,496
我愿尽我所能
If I can.

913
01:17:34,541 --> 01:17:36,728
你在流浪
You're meanderings,

914
01:17:36,773 --> 01:17:38,309
在夜里流浪
nocturnal meanderings,

915
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:42,227
有没有走过Park俱乐部?
do they ever take you past the Park Club?

916
01:17:43,116 --> 01:17:49,345
St. Simon勋爵 在婚礼前夜遭到枪击
Lord St. Simon was shot at on the night before his wedding

917
01:17:49,387 --> 01:17:50,877
是你干的吧?
that was you?

918
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:54,637
我无法眼睁睁地看着 另一条生命遭到毁灭
Couldn't bear to see another life destroyed.

919
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:01,101
Robert勋爵的妻子
Lord Robert's wife,

920
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:04,907
他的第一任妻子是被谋杀的
first wife, was murdered.

921
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:06,443
谋杀?
Murdered?

922
01:18:07,096 --> 01:18:08,473
她也拥有一笔财产

923
01:18:08,515 --> 01:18:10,705
他们在法国度完蜜月不久
She was robbed and killed

924
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:13,267
她就遭到了抢劫并被杀害了
shortly after their honeymoon in France.

925
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:14,313
谁干的?
By who?

926
01:18:14,892 --> 01:18:16,385
一个叫Thomas Floutier的人
A man called Thomas Floutier.

927
01:18:16,428 --> 01:18:17,369
他被定罪了吗?
Was he convicted?

01:18:17,412 --> 01:18:19,734
是的 可是他逃走了
Yes but he escaped

929
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,679
他现在在哪儿?
and where is he now?

930

你觉得他在哪儿?
Where do you think he is?

931
01:18:32,609 --> 01:18:33,731
知道吗?
Any idea?

932

Glovin
Glovin.

933
01:18:36,507 --> 01:18:38,591
不 我不知道...不知道
No I don't know... I don't know.

934
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:40,233
我没有证据
I have no proof.

935
01:18:40,833 --> 01:18:42,543
只不过是凭借直觉吧
Just the strength of your convictions.

936
01:18:42,586 --> 01:18:43,641
是的
Yes.

937
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:46,040
Northcote小姐
Miss Northcote

938
01:18:46,613 --> 01:18:48,747
恐怕你那一枪的声音
I'm afraid the sound of your shot

939
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:52,148
没有传到我们高贵的单身汉的耳朵里啊

第三次结婚的St. Simon勋爵

941
01:19:03,226 --> 01:19:05,440
我不能指望你明白

01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:07,323
我有多羡慕你

01:19:08,396 --> 01:19:11,446
棋逢对手
A delight it must be

944
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:15,454
真是令人愉快
to face an opponent of some worth.

945
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,370
失陪一下
Excuse me.

946
01:19:19,971 --> 01:19:21,055

噢 当然了
Oh yes.

他已经在帮忙了
He already is.

950
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:43,114
Bella当时在教堂里
Bella was in the church.

951
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,409
对吧 我的宝贝
Weren't we my sweetness,

952
01:19:45,453 --> 01:19:46,745
我悄悄把Bella带了进去
I smuggled Bella in.

953
01:19:46,786 --> 01:19:49,854
她像金子般闪耀
She was as good as gold.

954
01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,016
发生了什么事吗?
Did anything occur?

955
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:56,793
噢 没有什么异常的
Oh nothing occurred out of the ordinary.

哦对了 甜蜜的小Hettie 把花束掉在地上了

959
01:20:04,141 --> 01:20:05,940
有人把它捡了起来
And had it picked up for her.

960
01:20:05,985 --> 01:20:08,098
-掉了花束 -那人挺迷人的
-Dropped her bouquet. -He was quite an attractive,

961
01:20:08,144 --> 01:20:10,360
我是说那个帮她捡起花束的人
the one who picked it up I mean.

962
01:20:10,407 --> 01:20:13,816
我想大概是Doran家的一个亲戚
One of the Doran's I suppose.

963
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:15,777
他看上去一身美国味
He looked American at any rate.

966
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:41,328
你不会碰巧还有一个女继承人备用吧?
You don't I suppose have another heiress up your sleeve?

967
01:20:41,332 --> 01:20:43,661
见你的鬼 Callahan
Damn you Callahan.

968
01:20:44,789 --> 01:20:46,065
你都看到了
The newspapers you see

969

报纸上报道了你岳父家门口发生的
reported a scene of disgusting vulgarity

970
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:49,723
恶心粗鄙的一幕
on your father in-law's doorstep.

971
01:20:49,763 --> 01:20:52,927
我纳闷你要怎么对他解释?
I wonder how you'll explain that to him?

972
01:20:52,938 --> 01:20:55,128
Doran觉得我清白无辜
Doran doesn't think me uninnocent.

973
01:20:55,171 --> 01:20:57,043
他接受了我的故事
He accepted my story.

974
01:20:57,663 --> 01:21:00,607
显而易见 Miller小姐喝醉了
It was clear to everyone that Miss Miller was drunk.

975
01:21:03,205 --> 01:21:05,916
而你则从我的搭档那里

976
01:21:05,960 --> 01:21:09,245

就这样了
That's all

978
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:14,867
一天还是两天?
a day or two?

979
01:21:15,588 --> 01:21:17,020
你必须给我证据
You must have proof.

980

证明什么 看在老天的份上?
Proof of what for God's sake?

981
01:21:21,337 --> 01:21:23,352
证明那只加州的小鹅

982
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,116
还愿意把金蛋下在Glovin 就这样

986
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:37,313
要是她能唱那么一出戏
If she's capable of a scene like that.

987
01:21:38,017 --> 01:21:40,438
她还能唱别的什么吧?
What else is she capable of?

988
01:21:40,447 --> 01:21:43,251
我希望她没有什么别的事情可说了
I hope she has nothing else to reveal.

989
01:21:43,258 --> 01:21:44,763
相信我
Trust me.

990
01:21:51,462 --> 01:21:53,396
一点也不 勋爵
Not an inch my Lord.

991

- 啊 对不起 - 等等 先生

有什么能为您效劳的吗?

999
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:20,673
雪利酒一杯多少钱?
How much is a glass of sherry?

1000
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:23,412
8便士
That would be 8.

我私底下答应了Moulton先生

01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:05,248
说你们两个都可以自由地回加州去
that you will both be free to return to California.

1004
01:23:05,296 --> 01:23:09,832
就当是 你的妻子从未进过那家教堂
It will be as if you're wife had never entered that church.

1005
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,386
你是怎么找到我们的?
How did you find us?

1006
01:23:16,433 --> 01:23:17,544
这个并不重要
That is unimportant.

1007
01:23:17,588 --> 01:23:18,948
要是你想听听我的看法
If I may give you my opinion

1008
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:21,634
我想这里头的秘密太多了一点
I think there's been a little too much secrecy already.

1009
01:23:21,678 --> 01:23:23,334
我可以跟Moulton太太谈谈吗?
May I speak to Mrs. Moulton?

1010
01:23:23,382 --> 01:23:26,148
你要先告诉我你们两个到底是谁才行
Not before you tell who the devil you are.

1011
01:23:26,195 --> 01:23:29,982
我们受雇于St. Simon勋爵 他要我们寻找他的妻子
We're been engaged by Lord St. Simonto find his wife.

1012
01:23:43,215 --> 01:23:46,140
Moulton先生 她父亲的反应会很激烈的
Mr. Moulton, her father will take it very hard

1013
01:23:46,187 --> 01:23:48,253
我想她没有跟他沟通过
I think that she did not communicate with him.

1014
01:23:48,298 --> 01:23:50,540
可是她有的 该死的 她有沟通过
But she did damn it, she did.

1015
01:23:50,586 --> 01:23:52,043
没错 Flora Miller的便条
And yes the note from Flora Miller

1016
01:23:52,086 --> 01:23:54,636
现在应该到他手上了
he would have received it by now.

1017
01:23:54,681 --> 01:23:55,687
很好
Good.

1018
01:23:55,732 --> 01:23:57,726
她父亲从未认可我
Her father never approved of me.

1019
01:23:57,770 --> 01:23:58,735
噢 是嘛
Oh really.

1020
01:24:00,297 --> 01:24:01,457
你知道在Gulf Shores... (在阿拉巴马州)
You see up in the Gulf Shores...

1021
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:04,759
当然这就是她父亲的理由了
Surely these are explanations for her father.

1022
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:10,687
要是你能听我说完
You made criticism of Henrietta's duties

1023
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:13,580
你会发现你是在批评Henrietta 对她父亲的孝心了
towards her father if you'll hear me out.

1024
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:15,419
我答应了老Doran
I promised old man Doran

1025
01:24:15,464 --> 01:24:18,056
我会离开 不再打扰Henrietta
I'd go away and not trouble Henrietta

1026
01:24:18,811 --> 01:24:20,554
直到我出人头地
until I'd made my way

1027
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:24,320
不过我们在我离开之前秘密结了婚
but we got married in secret before I went.

1028
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:28,120
后来 有人告诉他们 我死在西北了
Then I was reported dead up in the high northwest

1029
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:33,483
Henrietta于是 就把我们秘密结婚的事告诉他了
so Henrietta told him then about our secret marriage.

1030
01:24:34,567 --> 01:24:37,964
他派人去调查 看我是否像他们说的那样死了
He sent someone out to check I was dead like they said.

1031
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,969
那人一直没有找到我
That man never found me

1032
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:46,101
Henrietta因我的死而死心了
so Henrietta gave me up for dead.

1033
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:52,871
Francis Harry Moulton先生
And so Mr. Francis Harry Moulton

1034
01:24:52,917 --> 01:24:55,677
大概你是出人头地了吧
presumably you have made your way.

1035
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,973
我现在经营旅馆 先生
I'm in hotels sir.

1036
01:24:58,016 --> 01:24:59,189
旅馆?

1037

一杯雪利酒你收费多少?

太迟了 Robert
It's too late Robert.

1046

我把所有的事情都告诉那孩子了
I told the child everything.

1047
01:26:58,787 --> 01:27:02,841
不管怎么说St. Simon勋爵本来可以 省下雇佣你们的钱的
Anyway Lord St. Simon may as well of saved his money from employing you.

1048
01:27:02,887 --> 01:27:03,655
你说这话什么意思?
Why do you say that?

1049
01:27:03,699 --> 01:27:06,099
因为Henrietta去见他了
Because Henrietta has gone to see him.

1050
01:27:06,142 --> 01:27:08,343
我真希望她不要那么做
I wish she had not done that.

1051
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:29,196

1097
01:31:58,228 --> 01:32:00,175
你带走了她 她在哪 Robert?
you took her away, where is she Robert?

1098
01:32:00,224 --> 01:32:01,672
-这样做对你没有好处 -你把她带到这儿来了
-This is no good. -And brought her here.

1099
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:04,499
-她在哪儿? -这样做对你没好处 该死的!
-Where is she? -It's no good damn it!

1100
01:32:04,545 --> 01:32:08,326
噢 上帝啊 这有什么要紧吗?
Oh God, what does it matter?

1101
01:32:12,664 --> 01:32:15,094
杀害你第一任妻子的凶手 为什么逃走了 Robert?
Why did the murderer of your first wife escape Robert?

1102
01:32:17,502 --> 01:32:19,974
那凶手为什么逃走了?
Why did the murderer of your first wife escape?

1103
01:32:20,018 --> 01:32:21,279
逃到哪里去了?
Where to?

1104
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:24,366
你在这儿是不是有个仆人 Robert?
Do you have a servant here Robert?

1105
01:32:24,992 --> 01:32:26,650
他是不是叫Thomas Floutier?
Is his name Thomas Floutier?

1106
01:32:26,697 --> 01:32:27,876
住口!
Quit!

1107
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,128
你以为你能干什么?
What do you think you could do?

1108
01:32:33,053 --> 01:32:35,984
看在上帝的份上
For God's sake.

1109
01:32:42,764 --> 01:32:45,699
当我...当我让你走
When...when I let you go.

1110
01:32:46,822 --> 01:32:49,297
Hettie  Hettie 我做的一切都是为了你
Hettie, Hettie what I did I did for you.

1111
01:32:49,345 --> 01:32:51,641
有了你 世界都改变了
With you the world changed.

1112
01:32:51,686 --> 01:32:53,573
Hettie  Hettie 你一定要相信我
Hettie, Hettie you must believe me,

1113
01:32:53,619 --> 01:32:55,323
说你相信我
say you believe me.

1114
01:32:56,289 --> 01:32:57,493
绝不
Never.

1115
01:33:00,301 --> 01:33:01,743
绝不
Never.

1116
01:33:01,996 --> 01:33:04,092
死也不说
Not this side of hell.

1117
01:33:04,142 --> 01:33:04,989
很好
Very well.

1118
01:33:05,936 --> 01:33:07,103
够了
That's it.

1119
01:33:08,733 --> 01:33:10,042
都结束了
It's over.

1120
01:33:23,834 --> 01:33:25,026
没错
Yes.

1121
01:33:26,135 --> 01:33:27,125
没错
Yes.

1122
01:33:27,597 --> 01:33:30,535
在这儿替我干活的 是Floutier没错
It's Floutier the man who works for me here.

1123
01:33:31,859 --> 01:33:32,916
除了别的事
Amongst other things

1124
01:33:32,962 --> 01:33:37,344
他还照料Helena
he looks after the needs of Lady Helena.

1125
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,649
你的固执
It may give you some satisfaction to know

1126
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:43,019
将会让她送命的
that your stubbornness will be

1127
01:33:43,065 --> 01:33:45,854
这下你满意了吧?
the inevitable cause of her death now.

1128
01:33:47,516 --> 01:33:48,997
当然还有你的命
Yours too of course.

1129
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:52,992
Floutier将会替你安排一起事故
Floutier will arrange an accident for you.

1130
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:57,543
你的钱都会是我的了
Money will revert to me.

1131
01:33:59,450 --> 01:34:04,426
适当地哀悼上一阵子
And after a suitable period of morning

1132
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:07,274
我就会离开
I'll leave.

1133
01:34:14,843 --> 01:34:16,322
你以为我爸爸
And you think Pa would

1134
01:34:16,367 --> 01:34:18,963
会就这么让你带着我的钱离开吗?
Iet you just walk off with my money?

1135
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:23,759
法律是不容争议的
You can't argue with the law.

1136
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:26,807
你是我的妻子
You're my wife.

1137
01:34:28,737 --> 01:34:30,012
不
No.

1138
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:32,204
不是的
I'm not.

1139
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,637
你觉得在教堂里 我出了什么事呢 Robert?
What do you think happened to me in the church Robert?

1140
01:34:36,492 --> 01:34:38,327
我把花束掉在地上了
When I dropped my bouquet.

1141
01:34:39,392 --> 01:34:41,806
那是因为我当时看见了我的丈夫
I saw the man I married.

1142
01:34:43,147 --> 01:34:45,006
一个鬼魂
A ghost.

1143
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:47,772
我以为他死了
I thought he was dead.

1144
01:34:51,508 --> 01:34:53,084
知道我去了哪儿吗
But that's where I've been.

1145
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,440
我和我的丈夫在一起
With my husband.

1146
01:35:03,718 --> 01:35:04,610
不!
No!

1147
01:36:18,886 --> 01:36:20,048
空荡荡的房间
Empty rooms.

1148
01:37:43,969 --> 01:37:45,515
还有那气味
The scent.

1149
01:37:52,425 --> 01:37:53,950
Thomas Floutier
Thomas Floutier.

1150
01:38:46,809 --> 01:38:50,605
华生 照顾她
Watson take care of her.

1151
01:43:37,848 --> 01:43:39,697
我经过了怎样的等待啊
How I've waited.

1152
01:43:40,059 --> 01:43:45,228
我在黑暗里 哭啊哭啊 就为这一刻
How I've cried again and again in the darkness for this moment.

1153
01:43:45,576 --> 01:43:46,646
我知道
I know.

1154
01:43:47,809 --> 01:43:49,026
我知道
I know.

1155
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,900
你是谁?
Who are you?

1156
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:09,768
你妹妹Agnes派来的
Emissaries of your sister Agnes.

1157
01:44:11,125 --> 01:44:12,171
告诉我
Tell me

1158
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:15,697
你是怎么做到的?
how did you do it?

1159
01:44:19,244 --> 01:44:22,936
我花了漫长的7年
I spent 7 long years

1160
01:44:22,979 --> 01:44:27,563
把这小教堂搞得摇摇欲坠
insuring the chapel's utter instability.

1161
01:44:29,414 --> 01:44:34,325
我试过逃跑 但没有一次成功
Any attempt I made to escape was thwarted

1162
01:44:35,228 --> 01:44:41,767
于是我改建了这个入口
so I recreated the entrance

1163
01:44:41,813 --> 01:44:44,849
一砖块一块砖
brick by brick,

1164
01:44:45,158 --> 01:44:47,259
一根木头一根木头
timber by timber.

1165
01:44:49,052 --> 01:44:52,877
我科学地利用了结构的不稳定性
I made a science of instability

1166
01:44:54,048 --> 01:44:56,179
我成功了
and I succeeded.

1167
01:44:57,009 --> 01:44:58,382
7年了
7 years.

1168
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:01,574
在我的办案中 这是独一无二的
It was unique in my experience

1169
01:45:01,622 --> 01:45:05,385
先伏法 后犯罪
to serve a sentence before committing the crime.

1170
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:08,965
护士?
Nurse?

1171
01:45:10,776 --> 01:45:15,953
我们就是这样发现了 Glovin真正的女主人
And so it was that we discovered the true Mistress of Glovin.

1172
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,011
一个毫不疯癫
A woman so far from madness

1173
01:45:18,058 --> 01:45:21,250
因而得以幸存于如此...不...
who had survived so...no...

1174
01:45:21,643 --> 01:45:24,562
她如此成功地
who had so triumphantly,

1175
01:45:24,607 --> 01:45:29,440
在7年的禁锢后幸存下来
triumphantly survived 7 years of captivity

1176
01:45:29,487 --> 01:45:31,954
以至于福尔摩斯很乐意把她
that Holmes was pleased to call her

1177
01:45:31,999 --> 01:45:33,499
称之为他所见到过的
one of the finest minds

1178
01:45:33,546 --> 01:45:36,145
最聪明的人
he had ever encountered.

1179
01:45:36,191 --> 01:45:36,876
遇到了她
In meeting her

1180
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,600
我想福尔摩斯也就揭开了 他那些梦的谜团
I believe Holmes solved the riddle of his dreams.

1181
01:45:40,649 --> 01:45:42,030
现在唯一让他困扰的是
It only troubles him now

1182
01:45:42,077 --> 01:45:47,103
他无法否认 可能梦也具有预言性
in so far as he cannot deny the possibility that it was prophetic.

1183
01:45:47,151 --> 01:45:48,376
Glovin的新主人并非别人
The new owner of Glovin

1184
01:45:48,416 --> 01:45:52,121
而正是Helena St. Simon女士
was none other than Lady Helena St. Simon.

1185
01:45:53,053 --> 01:45:55,542
Helena女士明智地决定要把它卖掉
Lady Helena wisely decided to sell it

1186
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:57,335
并且赎回用它作抵押的东西
and redeem the mortgages upon it.

1187
01:45:57,383 --> 01:46:00,541
正因为有了Moulton一家
I cannot conceive of a happier prospect

1188
01:46:00,587 --> 01:46:02,901
还有他们家庭的幸福未来
than to imagine Glovin restored

1189
01:46:02,942 --> 01:46:04,314
使得Glovin恢复了生机
for the enjoyment of the Moulton's

1190
01:46:04,361 --> 01:46:06,624
我无法想象比这更好的前景了
and their future family.

1191
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:07,953
你竟敢...
How dare you.

1192
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:12,307
你竟敢记录这件案子
How dare you make a record of this case.

1193
01:46:12,350 --> 01:46:14,852
记录...不不不
Rec...no, no, no, no.

1194
01:46:15,484 --> 01:46:18,498
我只不过是在回复
I'm merely answering an invitation

1195
01:46:18,546 --> 01:46:20,053
另一个研讨会的请柬罢了
to another seminar.

1196
01:46:20,670 --> 01:46:21,657
真的吗?
Really?

1197
01:46:22,627 --> 01:46:24,922
那快点 我们一小时后要动身了
Well be quick, we leave in an hour.

1198
01:46:25,469 --> 01:46:26,415
干嘛去?
What for?

1199
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,657
看在上帝的份上 当然是看演出了
For heavens sake what's in the performance?

1200
01:46:36,137 --> 01:46:37,795
<i>谢谢</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1201
01:46:38,967 --> 01:46:43,718
