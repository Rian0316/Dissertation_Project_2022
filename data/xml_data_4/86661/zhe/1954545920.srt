1
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:15,441

2
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:25,254

3
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:33,927

4
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:44,640

5
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:49,901
亲爱的福尔摩斯
<i>My Dear Holmes,</i>

6
00:00:49,938 --> 00:00:52,835
今天我步行了14英里 穿越了崎岖的地势
<i>today I walked 14 miles across rough terrain</i>

7
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:56,286
腿脚或肩膀却没有感到 丝毫酸痛
<i>and hardly a twinge from either my leg or my shoulder.</i>

8
00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:59,815
风景正如传说中一样美丽
<i>The landscape is as handsome as it is reported.</i>

9
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,588
我仍然希冀
<i>I still entertain the hope</i>

10
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,966
能说服你也与我同行
<i>that I can prevail upon you to join me.</i>

11
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:06,861
当然我理解
<i>I appreciate, of course,</i>

12
00:01:06,898 --> 00:01:09,796
大自然的美丽对你几乎没有意义
<i>that the beauties of nature mean little to you,</i>

13
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,040
但我相信你会发现
<i>but I believe you would have found</i>

14
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:15,115
在我下榻旅馆里的几位客人 非常引人注意
<i>some of the guests at my hotel most intriguing.</i>

15
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:19,643
道德的光辉闪耀在一位
<i>Moral splendor is on display in the person</i>

16
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,225
叫Shlessinger的少校身上
<i>of the striking Major Shlessinger,</i>

17
00:01:22,264 --> 00:01:24,279
一位布尔战争的英雄
<i>a hero of the Boer War,</i>

18
00:01:24,316 --> 00:01:26,324
不幸在Ladysmith保卫战斗中 成了瘸子
<i>sadly crippled in the defense of Ladysmith</i>

19
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:29,558
现在投身于慈善事业
<i>and now engaged in charitable work.</i>

20
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:31,111
Calder女士是他的护士
<i>His nurse is a Ms. Calder</i>

21
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:35,876
值得注意的是 她不仅是他的信徒
<i>whose attentiveness suggests not only that she is his disciple but also</i>

22
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:39,866
而且或许里面还有更为亲密的感情
<i>that tenderer feelings may be involved.</i>

23
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,819
然而  最令人雀跃的是
<i>Most fascinating of all, however,</i>

24
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:44,778
一位非常杰出的女士
<i>is an extraordinary woman,</i>

25
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:48,491
能在任何群体中脱颖而出的人
<i>one who would stand out in any society,</i>

26
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:51,712
Frances Carfax女士
<i>the Lady Frances Carfax.</i>

27
00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:55,034
我想有人会觉得她很前卫
<i>I suppose one would call her modern</i>

28
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,673
除了她似乎是来自
<i>except that she seems to come from</i>

29
00:01:56,711 --> 00:01:59,550
某个古老的英国怪异贵族的分支
<i>an ancient line of English eccentrics.</i>

30
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:03,220
昨天 像是要证明自己的特立独行
<i>Yesterday, as if to confirm the general opinion of her oddity,</i>

31
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:04,442
她声称她会
<i>she declared that she would</i>

32
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,051
自己驾船穿过湖泊去教堂
<i>sail herself to church across the lake.</i>

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,960

34
00:02:46,274 --> 00:02:49,052
在旅馆的马车上 大家还纷纷猜测着
<i>There was much speculation in the hotel carriage</i>

35
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:52,632
在前往湖边那座 精致的小礼拜堂的路上
<i>as we traveled towards the charming little lakeside chapel</i>

36
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:54,182
谈论Frances女士是否
<i>about whether Lady Frances</i>

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,310
能像她所说的那么能干
<i>would be as good as her word.</i>

38
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:58,156
而其中居然愚蠢到怀疑她的人
<i>And those of us foolish enough to doubt her</i>

39
00:02:58,192 --> 00:03:02,319
很快就因出现在浅滩上的小船 而自食其言
<i>were soon rebuked by the sight of a skiff moored in the shallows</i>

40
00:03:02,357 --> 00:03:06,459
还有因为那位像我们招呼时 目光灼灼的船长
<i>and by the stern gaze of its captain when she greeted us within.</i>

41
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:14,277
一次出人意料的精彩布道 牧师
A surprisingly jolly sermon, Vicar,

42
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,244
非常之惊喜
a lot like a cat.

43
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,988
她不仅不在乎给大家留下的印象
<i>Well, she appears to care not a jot what her fellow guests make of her</i>

44
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:23,876
似乎也对自己给所到之处
<i>and seems quite insensible to the vivid impression</i>

45
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,531
留下的活泼身影毫无察觉
<i>she creates wherever she goes.</i>

46
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,707
我们都被逗乐了
<i>We were all amused certainly</i>

47
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:36,195
看着她努力把小船驶离岸边
<i>at the sight of her trying to board the skiff,</i>

48
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:39,811
但既然她有本事开船而来
<i>but since she had accomplished the outward journey with such skill,</i>

49
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,165
我们没有理由认为
<i>we had no reason to suppose</i>

50
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:45,889
她的返程会碰上更大的困难
<i>that her return voyage would present her with any greater difficulty</i>

51
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:49,372
或者会预料到最后的结果
<i>or that it would end in the way that it did.</i>

52
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:17,014
我决定翻越小山走回去
<i>I had decided to walk back across the fill</i>

53
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,800
这样我就不必留在那些等待
<i>so I was not amongst those who waited</i>

54
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:20,981
为Frances女士返航庆祝的人群中
<i>to cheer Lady Frances on her return.</i>

55
00:04:21,535 --> 00:04:23,981
我比预计的时间晚到了一点
<i>I arrived a little later at exactly the moment</i>

56
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,984
当时的情况真是千钧一发
<i>when tragedy threatened to strike.</i>

57
00:04:27,489 --> 00:04:28,959
救命!
Help!

58
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,279
救命 在这里!
Help, here!

59
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:39,639
救命!
Help!

60
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:43,298
我当时无能为力 亲爱的福尔摩斯
<i>I was helpless, my dear Holmes,</i>

61
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:44,775
无能为力
<i>helpless.</i>

62
00:04:45,568 --> 00:04:48,972
在我的一生中 我从未如此 感到自己的无力
<i>I have never felt so powerless in my life,</i>

63
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:50,338
我本以为有人与我一样
<i>as powerless so I thought</i>

64
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,372
那位坐在自己轮椅上的老兵
<i>as the old soldier in his wheelchair</i>

65
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,589
也只能拼命呼救 来寻求帮助
<i>who had only been able to shout, it seemed, for help.</i>

66
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:57,583
凭着阅历
<i>As with many men,</i>

67
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,035
我早就注意到 一个某部分有残疾的人
<i>I have noticed a weakness in one part of the body</i>

68
00:05:00,072 --> 00:05:03,610
作为补偿 其它地方会有惊人的力量
<i>is compensated by great strength elsewhere.</i>

69
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:06,717
尽管无法行走
<i>Unable to walk,</i>

70
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,271
Shlessinger仍然能够奋力在水中游泳
<i>Shlessinger was yet able to swim powerfully</i>

71
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,822
仅仅靠他的臂膀
<i>with his arms alone.</i>

72
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,912
后来旅馆的援兵也及时赶到了
<i>Reinforcements arrived in due course from the hotel,</i>

73
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,290
一场悲剧就这样被避免了
<i>and tragedy was happily averted.</i>

74
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:27,250
现在 一切恢复正常
<i>Now, all parties are recovered,</i>

75
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,613
据说Frances女士
<i>it is reported that the Lady Frances</i>

76
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,373
不满自己的获救
<i>is resentful of her rescue</i>

77
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,700
就好像是她的女权主张
<i>as if her suffragette principles</i>

78
00:05:33,737 --> 00:05:36,369
因此会成了一种让步
<i>had been somehow compromised.</i>

79
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:38,172
但所有人都认同
<i>All agree at any rate</i>

80
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,119
Shlessinger少校是当时的英雄
<i>that Major Shlessinger is the hero of the hour.</i>

81
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:47,788
现在Calder女士的精力 都放到了霸道的爱慕上
<i>Ms. Calder's attentions are now translated into patent adoration.</i>

82
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:50,711
毫无疑问 在明天旅馆里
<i>No doubt further praise will be in order</i>

83
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,746
在他进行的传教士活动上
<i>when he lectures on his missionary activities</i>

84
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,566
一定会听到更多的赞美之词
<i>at the hotel tomorrow.</i>

85
00:05:55,814 --> 00:06:01,291
顺便说一句 他是 基督医疗福音教会的英国代表
<i>He is, by the way, the British representative of the Mission Church of Christ the Healer</i>

86
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:04,992
基地就在秘鲁的安第斯高地
<i>whose theater works in the high Andes of Peru.</i>

87
00:06:13,585 --> 00:06:14,943
早上好
Morning.

88
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:21,868
Shlessinger少校在回避我
Major Shlessinger is avoiding me.

89
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:25,831
可怜的人在为自己的 英勇行为感到尴尬
The poor man is embarrassed by his own heroism.

90
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:29,197
也许他现在认为 我有义务为他的事业出一份力
Perhaps he now thinks I'm obliged to contribute to his work.

91
00:06:30,345 --> 00:06:33,306
人就是有这样显著的弱点
Men have such extraordinary weaknesses.

92
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:34,900
你不这么想吗?
Don't you think.

93
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:39,694
哦 是的 当然了 我们就是这样 当然 我赞同
Oh, yes, certainly, we do, of course, I agree.

94
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:45,441
你介意到湖边转一转吗 医生
Would you care to take a turn by the lake, Doctor?

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,332
Shlessinger少校为他的教会 不知疲倦的工作
Major Shlessinger works tirelessly for his church,

96
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,641
不是吗
does he not?

97
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:08,656
我明白他们需要大笔的资金
I understand the need for funds is considerable.

98
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:11,027
明天他会在旅馆举办讲座
He's lecturing on his cause tomorrow

99
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,483
希望能筹集到一些资金
here in the hotel hoping to raise some money.

100
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,585
他会大有收获
He'll do well.

101
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:17,072
当地妇女会很乐意各自 捐出半个几尼(英国旧金币)
The local matronage will happily part with half a guinea each

102
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:21,411
得到一个和这样一位男士 在公共场所相处的机会
for the company of such a man all be it in public.

103
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:23,225
我吓到你了吗
Do I shock you?

104
00:07:23,262 --> 00:07:24,565
一点也没有
Not at all.

105
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:26,075
我吓到了我的哥哥
I shock my brother.

106
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,579
作为Rufton伯爵
As the Earl of Rufton,

107
00:07:27,618 --> 00:07:30,968
我想他觉得有义务被吓到
I think he feels it is his duty to be shocked.

108
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,960
啊 这里很漂亮 不是吗
Oh, it's very beautiful here, isn't it?

109
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,896
我童年的每个夏天 都在这湖边度过
I spent every summer of my childhood here by this lake.

110
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:43,681
美轮美奂
It's very beautiful.

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,126
确实如此
It is indeed.

112
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:50,163
他明天会来看望我
He's to visit me tomorrow.

113
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:51,306
谁?
Who?

114
00:07:51,344 --> 00:07:52,407
我的哥哥
My brother.

115
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:55,231
这也是义务 当然了
That is duty, too, of course.

116
00:07:58,314 --> 00:07:59,621
该死的他
Damn him.

117
00:08:00,783 --> 00:08:02,908
该死的他!
Damn him.

118
00:08:23,146 --> 00:08:25,192
啊  Frances女士
Ah, Lady Frances.

119
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:29,614
真是令人惊喜
What a pleasant surprise.

120
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,792
我必须承认她的行为
<i>I must confess that her behavior</i>

121
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,821
始终让我着迷
<i>continues to fascinate me.</i>

122
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:36,936
我承认她对这个陌生的
<i>I grant that her reaction to this</i>

123
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:39,572
骑马者的反应非常激烈
<i>unknown horseman was extreme,</i>

124
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,481
但她的许多反应都是这样
<i>but many of her reactions are.</i>

125
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,208
她是不是认识他呢 我在猜想
<i>Had she known him, I wonder?</i>

126
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:48,664
过去发生了什么 让她对他如此害怕
<i>What lies in her past to prompt this fear of him?</i>

127
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,333
为了寻找答案
<i>In looking for an explanation,</i>

128
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,802
我期待着
<i>I am placing some hopes</i>

129
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,231
今天下午 Rufton伯爵
<i>in the visit we expect this afternoon</i>

130
00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:56,819
她哥哥的到访
<i>from her brother, the Earl of Rufton.</i>

131
00:08:56,857 --> 00:09:00,958
据说 他的古怪与他妹妹
<i>By all accounts,his oddities are of an entirely different order</i>

132
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,831
正好相反
<i>from those of his sister.</i>

133
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,773
当她在嘲笑传统时
<i>Where she flouts convention,</i>

134
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,287
他会把过去时代的习俗
<i>he has raised the conventions of a former era</i>

135
00:09:07,325 --> 00:09:09,606
上升到信仰的高度
<i>to the status of a faith.</i>

136
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:12,653
而说到自己
<i>As for myself,</i>

137
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:15,014
我注意到自己越来越漠视
<i>I notice an increasing indifference</i>

138
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,278
周围的秀色美景
<i>to the natural beauty which lies about me.</i>

139
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,906
我的思绪时常回到
<i>My thoughts return constantly</i>

140
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:21,756
Frances女士
<i>to the Lady Frances.</i>

141
00:09:22,374 --> 00:09:23,993
她的一些事情
<i>There is something about her life</i>

142
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,011
会激起我的同情心
<i>which prompts my sympathy,</i>

143
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:27,546
一些我可以感受到的悲伤
<i>some unhappiness I can sense</i>

144
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:30,142
令我想把它们驱散
<i>which I would dearly like to dispel.</i>

145
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:33,170
我寄希望她的精神
<i>It is to be hoped that her spirits</i>

146
00:09:33,207 --> 00:09:35,463
能随着她哥哥的来访而恢复
<i>will be lifted by her brother's visit</i>

147
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:36,732
不要再压抑
<i>for she remains subdued</i>

148
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,024
昨天与那陌生人的偶遇而产生的心情
<i>from yesterday's strange encounter.</i>

149
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:43,999
他是谁  福尔摩斯
<i>Who is he, Holmes?</i>

150
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:47,949
为什么他不希望自己被认出
<i>Why does he not wish to make himself known?</i>

151
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,077
到底是为什么
Why indeed?

152
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,561
华生  你真有份好心肠
Watson, you're a brick.

153
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,630
我来到这里  Fanny 是想知道你的近况
I came here, Fanny, to see how you were,

154
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:22,806
而不是被说教
not to be lectured.

155
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:24,090
这不是说教而是请求
It's not a lecture, it's a request.

156
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:25,226
这听起来就像是说教
It sounds like a lecture.

157
00:10:25,263 --> 00:10:26,943
其实很简单 我需要些钱
It's quite simple, I need some money.

158
00:10:26,981 --> 00:10:28,871
就这样吗?
Just like that?

159
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:31,349
我想你又做得过分了  是不是
I suppose you've been overdoing again, haven't you?

160
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,042
我没有过分  John
I do not overdo it, John.

161
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,643
如果我花了太多
If I have ever overspent

162
00:10:34,682 --> 00:10:36,472
你给我的那丁点零花钱
the wretched allowance you've given me,

163
00:10:36,508 --> 00:10:38,380
那是因为有人需要帮助
it's because someone has been in need.

164
00:10:38,419 --> 00:10:41,294
哦 是啊 你那著名的金子般的心
Oh, yes, your famous heart of gold,

165
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,691
除了那都是我的钱 现在也没了
except that it's my money, and there isn't any.

166
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:45,969
你是非常清楚的 没有了
You know perfectly well there isn't.

167
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:47,170
我们已经大不如前
The hall is falling to bits.

168
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,707
在东翼有了猫头鹰的家族
There's a family of owls in the east wing,

169
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,174
你自己想想吧
and you think.

170
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:53,785
现在又是什么呢
What is it this time?

171
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:57,215
帮助在Islington身无分文的诗人
Helping penniless poets in Islington?

172
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:59,259
你只知道如何地残酷 是吧
You only know how to be cruel, don't you?

173
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,905
你什么时候在乎过我要什么
When have you ever cared for what I want?

174
00:11:01,942 --> 00:11:05,132
我过去15年的岁月是如此可怜
The last 15 years of my life have been wretched

175
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,996
而现在 至少 我有机会
and now, at last, I had a chance

176
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:08,710
能做点什么事
to make something of it.

177
00:11:08,747 --> 00:11:11,037
这难道对你没有任何意义吗
Doesn't that have any meaning for you?

178
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,522
下午好
Good Afternoon.

179
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,380
我看不出任何区别
I don't see what difference it makes.

180
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:25,074
区别就在于
The difference it makes

181
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:26,910
我一直都在被你指挥
is that I'm being told what to do.

182
00:11:26,948 --> 00:11:28,126
你知道我讨厌这样
You know I loathe it.

183
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,014
问题是你从来就不听取意见
The trouble is you won't even take advice,

184
00:11:30,051 --> 00:11:30,612
不是吗
will you?

185
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,170
一切都给了你
You've been offered everything.

186
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,199
却统统被你拒绝了
You've turned it all down.

187
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,110
给了我什么?
What have I been offered?

188
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:35,830
婚姻  美满的婚姻
Marriage, good marriages.

189
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:37,426
哈 哈 哈...
Ha, ha, ha.

190
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:42,037
给一个有头衔的乡下人做免费的奴隶
To be the unpaid slave of a titled yokel

191
00:11:42,074 --> 00:11:43,691
这种人连书都没看过一本
who hasn't even read a book,

192
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:46,051
以为巴赫(音乐家)是种小猎犬
who thinks Bach is something terriers do.

193
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,397
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

194
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,073
你还有什么反对我的理由?
What have you got against me doing this?

195
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,915
有什么?
What?

196
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:55,604
我要远离这种可悲混乱的生活
I want to get out of this miserable mess my life is in

197
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,348
看在上帝的份上 让我做自己
to be my own woman, for God's sake,

198
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,897
让我过一段充实的日子
to fulfill just a portion of my life.

199
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:07,220
你为什么总是拖我的后腿
Why do you always hold me back?

200
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,582
好好想想  John
Think of it, John,

201
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:12,008
好好想想
think of it.

202
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:13,626
只要一笔钱
Just one payment.

203
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:14,895
就一次
One.

204
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,055
你就可以永远摆脱我了
You could see the back of me forever.

205
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:20,633
正如我们展示的骡子运输
The mule express as we have dubbed it

206
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:23,195
每个月会递送邮件
brings the mail once a month.

207
00:12:23,232 --> 00:12:24,011
信件 当然了
Letters, of course,

208
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,474
来自基督图书馆的精神粮食
and food for the mind from the Library of Christ.

209
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:31,215
以及为我的人们带来健康的药品
And medicines for the well being of my flock

210
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:38,560
就是这群你们看到的站在楼外 临时钟楼下的人们
whom you may see here posing outside the mission below a temporary belfry.

211
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,026
在我向你们展示下一幅
When I show you the next picture

212
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:43,964
我教会中一名领导成员的照片时
of a leading member of my congregation,

213
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:47,856
你就会明白牧羊人和迷失的羔羊的寓言
you will understand how the parable of the shepherd and the lost sheep

214
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,234
为什么在我们的传教中改成了
has become transmuted in our teaching

215
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:53,674
牧人和迷失的美洲驼
into that of the llama herd and the lost llama.

216
00:12:55,176 --> 00:12:58,479
最后是我们的教堂
And finally, our church,

217
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:02,884
虽然简陋 粗糙 破烂
humble as it is, rough and poor indeed,

218
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:04,318
我可以骄傲地说
I'm proud to tell you

219
00:13:04,355 --> 00:13:05,117
上帝的言语
that the word of God

220
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:08,538
在其中被激情地宣讲
is preached as fervently within its walls

221
00:13:08,576 --> 00:13:11,546
并收到了热烈欢快的响应
and is as joyously received there

222
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:15,463
正如在本土的大教堂里一样
as in any great cathedral here at home.

223
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,872
谢谢
Thank you.

224
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,499
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

225
00:13:26,537 --> 00:13:29,418
正如我预料中的鼓舞人心
It was inspiring as I predicted.

226
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:35,638
我很遗憾地说Shlessinger少校 行程紧凑 马不停蹄
I regret to say that the rigors of his itinerary press hard upon Major Shlessinger

227
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:38,116
很快就要出发去Whitehaven
who will shortly be departing for Whitehaven.

228
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:43,941
就让我们为了他可敬的传教团开始募捐吧
We shall be taking up a collection on behalf of his estimable mission, of course.

229
00:13:43,977 --> 00:13:45,016
你什么意思
What do you mean?

230
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,638
我是说你能自己补救
I mean that the remedy lies in your own hands.

231
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:48,322
怎么做?
How?

232
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,069
你知道该怎么做
You know how.

233
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:52,079
如果你是认真的 你会知道怎么做
If you're really serious, you'll know what to do,

234
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:52,929
该死
damn it.

235
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,256
我厌恶了你总是来求助于我
I'm sick of you coming to me

236
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,725
就为了这些疯狂的念头
with these crackpot notions.

237
00:13:55,763 --> 00:13:57,920
你知道我的责任
You know my responsibilities.

238
00:13:57,957 --> 00:13:59,855
如果你没有放弃所有给你的机会
If you hadn't thrown away all your chances,

239
00:13:59,894 --> 00:14:01,394
也不会落到现在这个田地
you wouldn't be in this position now.

240
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:03,231
我已经受够了
Well, I've had enough.

241
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,334
你知道你该做什么
You know what you have to do.

242
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:08,352
成熟点 去做吧
Grow up and do it.

243
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,204
我最后的求助 这真的是我最后的求助
My last resort, my very last resort.

244
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,060
你怎么能这么说
How can you suggest it.

245
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:14,627
马夫
Groom.

246
00:14:15,538 --> 00:14:17,322
马夫
Groom.

247
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:19,537
你到底在哪里
Where the devil are you?

248
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,709
Shlessinger先生的见面会 是在哪个房间举行
In which room is Mr. Shlessinger's meeting taking place?

249
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:11,588
我恐怕见面会已经在 半小时前结束了 女士
I am afraid the meeting finished half an hour ago, madam.

250
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:13,998
Shlessinger先生即刻就要 动身去Whitehaven
Mr. Shlessinger will have left for Whitehaven by now.

251
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:15,170
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

252
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:17,299
是的 我忘记了
Yes, I've forgotten.

253
00:15:17,337 --> 00:15:18,741
谢谢
Thank you.

254
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:24,639
Frances女士
Lady Frances.

255
00:15:33,619 --> 00:15:36,988
别来纠缠我!
Leave me alone.

256
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:42,201
抱歉
Excuse me.

257
00:15:42,452 --> 00:15:44,219
你 先生
You, sir.

258
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,806
无容置疑
<i>I've no doubt</i>

259
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,533
你会告诉我这是无谓的担心 福尔摩斯
<i>you will tell me my fears are unfounded, Holmes,</i>

260
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,809
但那个人的反复出现
<i>but the repeated appearance of this man</i>

261
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:53,766
已经为她的生活蒙上了阴影
<i>has cast a shadow over her life</i>

262
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:57,138
无论她多努力还是无法摆脱
<i>which try as she might she cannot lift.</i>

263
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:04,667
"...Elmyria号上的悲剧 Rosenbloom家族继承人溺水身亡"

巨大的危险 Frances女士 句号
Grave danger Lady Frances, stop.

280

不要让她走出视线 句号
Never let from sight, stop.

00:17:59,158 --> 00:18:02,131
我在路上 福尔摩斯
On my way, Holmes.

00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:03,583
这份电报来了多久?
How long has this been here?

283
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,050

失踪了 华生

失踪了
Disappeared.

287
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:53,229
Frances女士结账了吗
Did Lady Frances pay her bill?

288
00:18:53,267 --> 00:18:54,373
没有先生
No, sir.

289
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:57,185
她有叫任何交通工具吗
Did she order any transport?

290
00:18:57,222 --> 00:18:58,393
不 先生
No, sir.

291

她有拿走自己的行李吗
And she took none of her luggage?

292
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,867
我想没有 先生
We think not, sir.

293
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,930
福尔摩斯先生在哪里
Where is Mr. Holmes?

294
00:19:09,342 --> 00:19:11,781
没有任何消息 福尔摩斯
Nothing yet, Holmes.

295
00:19:13,598 --> 00:19:15,555
我开始害怕最坏的结果
I'm beginning to fear the worst.

296
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,482
要怪我自己
I blame myself.

297
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,175
我知道我该抓住那个人
I knew I should have pursued that fellow.

298
00:19:18,213 --> 00:19:20,241
有一个可能性
It is a possibility.

299
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,456
是什么
What is?

300
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,562
你还没看出来吗 再明显不过了
Do you not see it? It is most conspicuous.

301
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,682
什么
What?

302
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,358
小船 华生 驶走的小船
The skiff, Watson, the sailing skiff.

00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,618
不在这里了
It's not here.

304
00:19:29,656 --> 00:19:30,429
非常正确
Precisely.

305
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,850
很可能Frances Carfax女士在上面

306
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:35,242

silent road to Avonside.

307
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,174
这是众所周知的最近的终点
It is the nearest railhead as you know.

308
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:39,876
你是说这个人用船绑架走了她?
You don't mean that this fellow abducted her by boat?

309
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,470
丝绸
Silk.

310
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,520
这是三个最大可能性之一
It is one of the three more likely possibilities.

311
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:50,615
最佳的法国缝纫  鸽灰色

312
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:51,940
她有一条灰色丝绸的披肩
She had a gray silk shawl.

313
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,525
不 没有更有价值的线索了
No, well, that will tell us nothing more.

314
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,765
是哪三个可能性  福尔摩斯
What are the three possibilities, Holmes?

315
00:19:55,802 --> 00:19:57,162
她通常在什么衣服时会戴上披肩?
In what did she usually wear the shawl?

316
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,205
她外出时的衣服
Oh, her outside clothes.

317
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,131
哪三个可能性?!
The three possibilities?

318
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,658
她可能和预谋的绑匪一起走了
She may have run away with her intended abductor.

319
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,752
或如你所说她被人用船绑架走了
He may have abducted her by boat as you suggest

320
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,754
或是其他方法
or by some other means.

321
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,455
也许她...考虑到她目前的情绪
She may, considering her emotional condition,

322
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:10,408
被人乘虚而入受骗出走
have been deceived into going with him.

323
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:11,223
这太难让人相信了
I can hardly believe that.

324
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,983
她非常害怕他 相信我
She was terrified of him, believe me.

325
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,423
我相信你
I believe you.

326
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:18,436
是的
Yes.

327
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,464
在狐狸的世界里迷路的小鸡
A stray chicken in the world of foxes.

328
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,390
一旦她被抓了 就不会失踪了
Once she's gobbled up, she's hardly missed.

329
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,212
来吧  华生
Come, Watson.

330
00:20:26,886 --> 00:20:28,601
我们的马应该备好了
And our horses should be saddled by now.

331
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,204
马?
Horses?

332
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:31,709
我选择骑马也许有些过分了
I have been somewhat extravagant in choice of mounts,

333
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:34,327
但拖延会在这时产生危险
but delay must be dangerous in this matter.

334
00:20:34,365 --> 00:20:37,205
我们要在黄昏时到达Rufton伯爵府
We should be at Rufton Hall at dusk.

335
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:48,848
我不知道什么让你这么有兴趣 先生
I don't see what possible interest it could have for you, sir.

336
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,777
我向你保证 非常吸引我
Considerable interest I assure you.

337
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,010
世界上最危险的事情之一
One of the most dangerous classes in the world

338
00:20:53,048 --> 00:20:55,459
就是单身的漂泊女子
is the drifting and friendless woman

339
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:57,236
得不到保护和指引
with no one to protect and guide her.

340
00:20:57,273 --> 00:21:01,911
不可避免地会诱使别人犯罪
She is the inevitable inciter of crime in others.

341
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:03,804
我对你妹妹失踪这件事
I treat the disappearance of your sister

342
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:06,142
抱着非常严肃的态度
with utmost seriousness.

343
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,994
你以为我不是吗
Do you think I do not?

344
00:21:08,032 --> 00:21:10,671
我不过是说你有点计较了
I'm merely suggesting that it is frivolous

345
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:14,234
不肯告诉我你们到底在争吵什么
to keep from me the substance of your quarrel.

346
00:21:14,271 --> 00:21:15,827
就是在争吵之后
It was after all this quarrel

347
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:18,442
她紧接着就失踪了
which immediately preceded her disappearance.

348
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:21,350
也许这和她曾经认识的
Might it have something to do

349
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:24,345
酗酒的诗人有关呢?
with a drunken poet she once knew?

350
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:25,732
什么?
What?

351
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,959
我从同事那获悉
I understand of my colleague

352
00:21:26,997 --> 00:21:29,661
她或许最近见过他
that she may have seen him recently.

353
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:30,954
Green吗?
Green?

354
00:21:32,873 --> 00:21:35,264
我以为那是最后一次见他
I thought I'd seen the last of him.

355
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,227
我15年前就打发他走了
I sent him packing, 15 years ago.

356
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,388
他和你妹妹是什么关系
What is his connection with your sister?

357
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:43,904
他曾追求过她
He used to court her.

358
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,041
一个活生生的畜牲
Great brute of a fellow.

359
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,215
她本不该和他扯上半点关系
She wouldn't have anything to do with him.

360
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,859
尊贵的Philip Green
The Honorable Philip Green.

361
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,505
没有比它更被玷污的名字了
Never was a title so abused.

362
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,998
他完全堕落了
He went to the dogs completely,

363
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:58,953
酗酒 赌博
drink, gambling.

364
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,743
最终在Islington破产
Ended up destitute in Islington

365
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,997
假装在写诗
pretending to write poetry.

366
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:07,828
当然  就在他一无所有的时候 Frances开始对他着迷
Of course, Frances became interested in him as soon as he lost everything.

367
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:10,258
你是怎么打发他的
How did you send him packing?

368
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,322
他是个野蛮的人
He was a violent fellow,

369
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,708
还酗酒
and he drank.

370
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,214
我听说有人要告他
I'd heard talk of prosecution,

371
00:22:17,251 --> 00:22:18,486
欠债  人身伤害
debt, assault.

372
00:22:18,524 --> 00:22:20,071
我给了他100镑
I gave him 100 pounds

373
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,650
买了张去澳大利亚的票给他
and bought him a ticket to Australia.

374
00:22:23,687 --> 00:22:24,710
要是他再在这里出现
Show his face around here,

375
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,463
我会放狗咬他
I'll set the dogs on him.

376
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:29,821
说说你和你妹妹的争吵
Now, your quarrel with your sister.

377
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:34,041
钱
Money.

378
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,537
她想要钱
She wanted money.

379
00:22:36,862 --> 00:22:38,252
她自己没有钱吗
She has none of her own?

380
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,080
我从财产中拨出一份零用钱给她
I make her an allowance out of the estate.

381
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:43,741
不多也不少 你看到这里了
It's modest, but you've seen the place.

382
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,788
她自己没有财产吗
She has no assets herself?

383
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:51,662
不 她有的
Yes, she has.

384
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,530
我告诉过她如果她需要钱
I told her if she wanted money,

385
00:22:54,568 --> 00:22:56,895
她可以把这个卖了
she could sell this.

386
00:22:57,575 --> 00:22:59,871
这是无价的藏品
It's a priceless collection.

387
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:08,280
这是Fragenalt为法国皇家设计的
That was designed for the French royal family by Fragenalt.

388
00:23:08,318 --> 00:23:10,265
我们在大革命时得到的
We acquired it all at the revolution,

389
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:12,342
而现在 都是她的了
and now, it's hers.

390
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:15,364
我有的就是猫头鹰
What I have is owls,

391
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:17,815
在东翼的猫头鹰
owls in the east wing.

想看看猫头鹰吗
Want to see the owls?

393
00:23:20,814 --> 00:23:23,008
她把这些放在哪里
Where does she keep them?

394
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:25,275
她旅行时会带在身边吗

不
No.

396

那么现在它们被放在哪里
Well, now, where are they kept?

397
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:34,445
我的天啊 你的妹妹消失了

如何和为什么我们都还不知道
How and why we do not know,

399
00:23:38,147 --> 00:23:39,202
但我有理由相信
but I have reason to believe

400
00:23:39,239 --> 00:23:42,721
她的处境非常危险
she is in the gravest danger.

401
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:44,442
我们知道了珠宝所在
Were we to know the where abouts of the jewelry,

402
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,276
也许就有救她的机会
we might have some chance of saving her.

403
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,094
在Pall Mall的Oxford&Lombard海事银行

410

证据就在我的掌握之中

要是她有什么意外  我会...

412

关系到一个家族在贵行寄存的私人物品

00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:47,298

你 先生!
You, sir?

就是你
You, sir.

422

我坚持要个答案

00:26:19,255 --> 00:26:20,948
Frances!
Frances!

425
00:26:27,396 --> 00:26:29,632
Frances!
Frances!

426
00:26:57,832 --> 00:26:59,333
怪我自己
I blame myself.

427
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,670
不 你不必
No, you need not.

428
00:27:03,716 --> 00:27:07,078
无论如何 我还是会
Nevertheless, I do.

429
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,982
我们都该自责
We all bear equal blame.

430
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:12,951
她又失踪了 就是这样
She's disappeared again, and that is that.

431
00:27:13,997 --> 00:27:17,461
再强调也没有意义了
It is pointless to dwell on it.

432
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:21,624
我们现在的任务是找到她
Our task now is to find her.

433
00:27:21,662 --> 00:27:23,045
Green先生
Mr. Green,

434

435
00:27:24,483 --> 00:27:26,565
昨天早上在湖边
by the lake yesterday morning.

我在黎明骑马外出
I was out riding in the dawn,

00:27:30,057 --> 00:27:31,971
我看到了小船
and I saw the skiff

438
00:27:32,009 --> 00:27:34,976
朝着Ironside 穿湖而去
sailing across the lake toward Ironside.

439
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,284
而你知道那是Frances女士
And you realized that it was the Lady Frances?

440
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,303
是的
Yes.

441
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,162
她是一个人吗
Was she alone?

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,590
是的
Yes.

443
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:42,891
请继续
Please continue.

444

我设法乘上了同一辆火车
I managed to board the same train.

445
00:27:46,721 --> 00:27:48,718
我求她和我说话
I begged her to speak to me.

446
00:27:48,757 --> 00:27:51,906
我告诉她我周游了世界
I told her how I'd traveled the world

447
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:54,520
成了一个非常富有的人

448
00:27:55,565 --> 00:27:59,197
我告诉她我从未停止爱她
I told her that I'd never stopped loving her

449
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,545
她可以得到任何她想要的东西

450
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:06,693
我现在可以见她了
I can see her now.

451
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,717
她坐在那里什么也没有说
She sat saying nothing,

452
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:12,647
像斯芬克斯那样微笑 (埃及的狮身人面)
smiling like a sphinx.

453
00:28:13,754 --> 00:28:17,341
不 她说道
No, she said.

454
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,833
她想要过自己的生活
She wanted to go her own way.

455
00:28:21,653 --> 00:28:22,656
当我们来到伦敦
When we got to London,

456
00:28:22,694 --> 00:28:24,608
我努力尾随着她
I followed her as best I could,

457
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:29,406
但她似乎下定决心要甩掉我
but she seemed determined to be rid of me.

458
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:32,774
我在靠近Sellick桥的地方跟丢了她
I lost her somewhere near Sellick Bridge.

459
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:33,968
Sellick?
Sellick?

460
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,397
最有趣的部分
Oh, that is most interesting.

461
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:37,881
为什么
Why?

462
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,274
有可靠消息 他常去的地方
I'm reliably informed that his usual haunts

463
00:28:40,312 --> 00:28:43,070
是威斯敏斯特的的西部
are west of Westminster.

464
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,703
谁常去的地方
Who's haunts?

465
00:28:44,741 --> 00:28:47,408
你怎么会出现在银行的?
How did you come to be at the bank?

466
00:28:47,446 --> 00:28:50,762
我猜她在伦敦需要钱
I reasoned that she would be needing money while she was in London,

467
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,406
我也知道他们家族所托银行的地址
and I know the address of the family bank well enough.

468
00:28:53,444 --> 00:28:55,066
我有个疯狂的想法
I had the wild idea

469
00:28:55,103 --> 00:28:57,603
想向那的经理寻求帮助
of enlisting the manager's help.

470
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,278
你知道她在哪吗  福尔摩斯先生
Do you know where she is, Mr. Holmes?

471
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:11,209
不 我不知道
No, I do not.

472
00:29:11,247 --> 00:29:13,269
那你觉得她会在哪里
Where do you think she is?

473
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:16,613
我相信通过我们的努力能够救出她
I believe that through our efforts to save her,

474
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,281
我们已经把她推向了她最坏的敌人
we have driven her into the hands of her worst enemy.

475
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,392
但我们看到她是自由的
But we saw her free.

476
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:23,334
我亲爱的华生
My dear Watson,

477
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,703
一个人会在悬崖边行走
a person may walk over the edge of the cliff

478
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:27,256
是因为他们被邀请去赏月
because they've been invited to gaze at the moon.

479
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:29,550
她的眼睛或许睁着
Her eyes may be open,

480
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:32,856
但是...我相信在这一刻
but she is I believe at this moment

481
00:29:32,894 --> 00:29:36,220
她正踏入致命的危险
walking into mortal danger.

482
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:44,303
Shlessinger
Shlessinger.

483
00:29:45,189 --> 00:29:46,858
Shlessinger先生
Mr. Shlessinger.

484
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:52,638
过去的一周里我去充分解了 世界各地罗马教廷的传教团
This last week I sought to acquaint myself with the world of apostolic missions.

485
00:29:53,548 --> 00:29:57,977
我还查询了苏格兰场的档案
I've also made a search of the records of Scotland Yard.

486
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,396
Shlessinger
Shlessinger,

487
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:07,136
也就是Joseph Cubbington牧师

Amos Callow Masaro的地区主教

489
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:14,677
也是Edmund 利马(秘鲁首都)的主教
and Edmund, the Bishop of Lima.

490
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,370
事实上 他的真名是Peters
His real name, in fact, is Peters.

491
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:18,621
一个厚颜无耻的骗子
He's a confidence trickster

492
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:24,378
在苏格兰场被没有新意地被称为"圣彼得"
known at Scotland Yard by the uninspired logic of that place as Holy Peters.

493
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,685
虽然至今没有疑点
What is not yet suspected

494
00:30:26,723 --> 00:30:28,179
但毫无疑问
but incontrovertible nonetheless

495
00:30:28,217 --> 00:30:30,376
他是个刽子手
is that he is a murderer.

496
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:35,638
Peters的专长是
Peters specialty,

497
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:40,773
利用宗教信仰和善良的心地 诓骗单身女子
is the beguiling of single woman with private means by playing on their religious and charitable feelings.

498
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:47,394
Helena Rosenbloom 为慈善事业献身十载
Helena Rosenbloom had been engaged in charitable work for ten years

499
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,322
当她遇到Shlessinger后

500
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,911
她被鼓励投身于在安格斯的新传教团上
He inspired her to devote her energies to a new mission in the Andes.

501
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,514
于是Rosenbloom女士 改变了她的遗嘱
Ms. Rosenbloom changed her will,

502
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:01,377
告别了她之前的生活
said good-bye to her former life

503
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:05,574
 在Glasgow登上了SS Elmyria号
and boarded the SS Elmyria at Glasgow

504
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:07,374
准备前往南美
bound for South America.

505
00:31:08,323 --> 00:31:09,818
她在海上失踪了
She was lost overboard

506
00:31:09,856 --> 00:31:12,568
就在出海的第一个晚上
the first night at sea.

507
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,396
于是SS Elmyria号在利物浦做了停靠
The SS Elmyria docked at Liverpool

508
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:22,469
以便她的家人取回她的遗物
for the family to retrieve her effects.

509
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:24,609
Shlessinger也上了岸
Shlessinger also disembarked.

510
00:31:24,646 --> 00:31:27,102
他在Lake District落脚
He went to ground at the Lake District

511
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:31,026
结识了他的下一个受害者
where he met his next intended victim,

512
00:31:31,943 --> 00:31:34,996
Frances Carfax女士
the Lady Frances Carfax.

513
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,863
终于 先生们
At last, gentlemen,

514
00:31:56,901 --> 00:31:58,770
终于
at last.

515
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,503
它在哪里被典当的?
Where was it pawned?

516
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,731
Stockwall的Riley当铺
Riley's of Stockwall.

517
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:07,159
我数了下 正好是我前往的第27间
It was by my calculation the 27th shop I tried.

518
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:11,214
据我所知 Riley因为收赃 而受到过两次法庭的宣判
Riley has received two sentences to my knowledge for the receipt of stolen goods.

519
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,375
他会和我们合作的
He will cooperate with us.

520
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:13,940
这是什么意思
What does this mean?

521
00:32:15,175 --> 00:32:16,396
什么意思!
What does it mean?

522
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:17,915
别这样 Green先生 这没有用
Please, Mr. Green, this is pointless.

523
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:19,032
别折磨你自己
Don't torture yourself.

524
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,586
你觉得我愿意折磨自己吗?
Do you think the torture is self-induced?

525
00:32:21,624 --> 00:32:25,107
想到Frances落在罪犯手里
The thought of Frances in the hands of criminals.

526
00:32:25,745 --> 00:32:28,565
我没法不去想 福尔摩斯先生
Such thoughts come unbidden, Mr. Holmes.

527
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:32,461
它们穿透了我的大脑 能筑起的最强的防线
They break through the strongest defenses the mind can  raise against them.

528
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:34,615
冷静 Green先生
Calm yourself, Mr. Green,

529
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,976
冷静
calm yourself.

530
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:40,055
如果她还对Shlessinger 的真实身份一无所知
If she's still innocent of Shlessinger's true identify,

531
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,988
也许现在还是安全的
she may well be safe for a time.

532
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:44,443
要是不是呢?
And if not?

533
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:49,759
那么显然他不会就这么 轻易地放过她
Then it is clear that he cannot let her loose without his own destruction.

534
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,475
现在 我们必须继续希望
Now, we must continue to hope

535
00:32:54,513 --> 00:32:57,821
她仍然不知道他是谁
that she remains ignorant of who he is.

536
00:32:59,252 --> 00:33:01,457
十五年
Fifteen years.

537
00:33:02,864 --> 00:33:06,525
我知道自己在没有所成前 是没脸回来的
I knew I could never come back  until I'd made something of myself.

538
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,973
也许我这么想很愚蠢
Perhaps it was foolish of me to think

539
00:33:10,011 --> 00:33:11,341
希望她会在这些年后
that she would look kindly on me

540
00:33:11,378 --> 00:33:13,009
她会好好对我
after all these years,

541
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:16,378
但我可笑地因为她一直没结婚
but I was ridiculously encouraged by the fact

542
00:33:16,414 --> 00:33:18,616
这样的事实所鼓舞
that she was not married.

543
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,065
而现在 我的愚蠢把她
And now, my stupidity has driven her

544
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:24,108
推向了凶手的怀抱
into the arms of a murderer.

545
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:27,272
我能做什么
What can I do?

546
00:33:28,824 --> 00:33:31,927
我什么都不能做吗?
Is there nothing I can do?

547
00:33:33,163 --> 00:33:35,613
Shlessinger看见过你吗
Does Shlessinger know you by sight?

548
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:36,639
没有
No.

549
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,464
啊  那么有件事你能做
Ah, well, then there is something that you can do.

550
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,770
但这需要你的耐心
But it'll demand great patience.

551
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:46,687
我已经等了15年了 福尔摩斯先生
I have waited for 15 years, Mr. Holmes.

552
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,989
Shlessinger希望珠宝能卖个好价钱
Shlessinger's had a fair price for the jewelry

553
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,226
而且不要被追问
and no questions asked.

554
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:52,513
他肯定会再到Riley的店里
He'll almost certainly return to Riley's shop.

555
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,640
还有Rosenbloom的遗物
And Rosenblooms attorney for the will.

556
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,951
现在 把这张纸条给Riley
Now, give this note to Riley.

557
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:58,899
他会让你在店里等候
He will let you wait at the shop.

558
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,003
可能会等很长时间
It may be a long wait,

559
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,116
但你必须要保持耐心
but you possess your soul in patience.

560
00:34:03,153 --> 00:34:05,950
最重要的是 不要使用暴力
And above all, no violence.

561
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,601
延误了
It's late.

562
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,862
应该早就到了
Well, it should have been here before now.

563
00:35:19,899 --> 00:35:23,977
他们说过这比普通的更花时间
Well, they say it took longer being out of the ordinary.

564
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:26,521
亲爱的 提醒我一下地址
The address, dear, remind me.

565
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,624
是的 先生 我能帮忙吗
Yes, sir, can I help?

566
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,959
Argyle大街
Argyle Street.

567
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:34,210
我在找Argyle大街
I'm looking for Argyle Street.

568
00:35:34,249 --> 00:35:36,231
在路口有个邮局
There's a post office round the corner.

569
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,913
问问那里吧
Try there.

570
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:43,054
Green先生 没有逮捕令 我们什么也不能做
Mr. Green, we can do nothing without a warrant.

571
00:36:43,091 --> 00:36:44,557
我忍不下去了
This is intolerable.

572
00:36:44,596 --> 00:36:46,686
在我们有了那个可怜的纸上签名之前
Until we have some wretched signature

573
00:36:46,723 --> 00:36:48,580
我们什么也不能做
on a piece of paper, we can do nothing.

574
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:51,500
同时 这些恶棍可以随意摆布她
Meanwhile, these fiends can do with her what they will.

575
00:36:51,539 --> 00:36:53,697
你确定 你告诉了我所有的细节?
Are you certain that you've told me every detail?

576
00:36:53,697 --> 00:36:55,638
所有的细节 我发誓
Every detail, I promise.

577
00:36:55,676 --> 00:36:58,349
那把这字条送到苏格兰场
Then take this note to Scotland Yard.

578
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:00,585
他们会明白其中的紧迫
They will understand the urgency of it.

579
00:37:00,623 --> 00:37:03,424
那我在那里等逮捕令
And I am to wait there for the warrant.

580
00:37:03,461 --> 00:37:05,179
你今天是不可能拿到的
You will not get it today.

581
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:07,552
什么?
What?

582
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:08,960
有些延迟是不可避免的
Some delay is inevitable.

583
00:37:08,998 --> 00:37:11,581
必须先找到当地法官
A magistrate must be found.

584
00:37:11,618 --> 00:37:15,367
法律程序我们只能推动它 不能驱赶它
The process of the law can be  encouraged but not goaded.

585
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,822
看在上帝的份上 明天就太晚了
Tomorrow may be too late for God's sake.

586
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:20,092
Green先生
Mr. Green,

587
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,212
能做的一切我们都会做

Go.

589

-明天就真的太晚了 -我很清楚

590
00:37:33,412 --> 00:37:35,399
带上武器  华生
Arm yourself, Watson.

591
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:39,380
我们得一如既往地 不按常理出牌
We are as usual the irregulars

592

必须去碰碰运气

00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:44,364
正如我们过去偶尔所为
as we have occasionally done in the past.

00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,591
明天早上八点
8:00 tomorrow morning,

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,385
Brickston公墓
Brickston Cemetery.

596
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:19,542
我想你被指错了路 先生
I fancy that you've been misdirected, sir.

597
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,354
也许你该上街走到底试试
Possibly if you try further down the street.

598
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:24,122
会的
That will do.

00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,526
你的名字是什么

我的朋友和同伴 我想你认识

00:38:40,794 --> 00:38:43,341
这所房子很快就会在警方的监视下
The house will shortly be under police observation

609
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:45,101
直到逮捕令到达
until a warrant is prepared

610
00:38:45,138 --> 00:38:47,071
得到搜索的授权

611
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:49,615
你的名字没有吓到我  福尔摩斯先生
Your name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes.

612
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:51,151
我没有什么可隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

613
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:52,232
你有何贵干
What is your business?

614
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,239
我在找Frances Carfax女士
I'm looking for the Lady Frances Carfax.

615
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,024
很高兴听你这么说
I'm delighted to hear it.

616
00:38:57,061 --> 00:39:00,027
如果有人能找到她  我想那就是你
If anyone can find her, I imagine you can.

617
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,699
也许到时候你能好心地来通知我一声
Perhaps you'd be so good as to tell me when you do.

618
00:39:02,736 --> 00:39:05,977
我有一张她将近100英镑的欠条
I've a note against her for nearly 100 pounds,

619
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:07,411
但是还没有看到一个子儿
and nothing to show for it

620
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,184
除了两件假首饰
but a couple of trumpery pendants

621
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,168
买家连看都不想看
that the dealer would hardly look at.

622
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:12,527
这女人在骗财
The woman's a leech.

623
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:14,891
你怎么敢这么说 先生
How dare you, sir.

624
00:39:15,259 --> 00:39:18,186
你在我们面前装成了 一个在战场上受伤的瘸子
You imposed upon us as a man crippled in a military action.

625
00:39:18,224 --> 00:39:20,163
你才是骗子
You are a fraud.

626
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,183
哦 或许在你对屠杀的定义下
Oh, it may not have been a military action

627
00:39:23,221 --> 00:39:26,704
那并不算是场军事行动 医生
to satisfy your standards of slaughter, Doctor,

628
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,289
但对我而言已经是了
but it was enough for me.

629
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,823
我佩服你的即兴创作
I salute your powers of improvisation, sir,

630
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,574
和厚颜无耻 但这没有用
and your effrontery, but it will not do.

631
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:38,126
哦 我没有在开玩笑
Oh, I'm perfectly serious.

632
00:39:38,164 --> 00:39:40,579
你找到她 我就欠你们一次
You find her, and I'm your debtor.

633
00:39:40,616 --> 00:39:43,475
我一定要搜查这里
I mean to go through this house until I do.

634
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:44,839
你有搜查令吗
You have a warrant?

635
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:46,838
在那之前这更有用
This will serve until a better one comes.

636
00:39:46,876 --> 00:39:48,756
你这岂不是入室抢劫
Why you're a common burglar.

637
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:50,640
我的朋友是个危险的暴徒
And my friend is a dangerous ruffian.

638
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:52,401
我们就是要搜你的房子
Together we mean to go through your house.

639
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:54,815
我没有办法阻止你们
I'm in no position to stop you.

640
00:39:54,816 --> 00:39:56,323
想搜查就搜吧
Search where you will.

641
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,332
我没什么可隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

642
00:39:58,725 --> 00:40:02,023
你买的棺材放在哪间屋里了?
Where is the coffin that you had brought into this house?

643
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,784
这和你无关
That is none of your business.

644
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:05,958
我再说一次 在哪里
I repeat where?

645
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,649
你自说自话冲进我家
Is it not enough

646
00:40:07,687 --> 00:40:10,451
用枪威胁我
that you force your way into my home,

647
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:12,712
难道还不够吗
that you threaten me at gunpoint,

648
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:16,609
你还要去打扰死者的安宁吗
must you also now invade the peace of the dead?

649
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:17,959
在哪里
Where?

650
00:40:18,486 --> 00:40:20,303
我不会告诉你
I shall not tell you.

651
00:40:20,722 --> 00:40:22,233
看住他 华生
Hold him here, Watson.

652
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,803
我不相信你会对 一个手无寸铁的人动手 医生
I don't believe you'd use that on an unarmed man, Doctor,

653
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:34,272
像我这样的情况
and in my condition.

654
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,371
我在印度的时候是士兵  先生
I was a soldier in India, sir.

655
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:38,557
我射杀过比你更圣洁的生物
I've shot nobler creatures than you.

656
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:42,291
灯 华生 灯
Lights, Watson, lights.

657
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:48,068
我闻到甲醛和收敛剂(凝血作用)了
I smelled formaldehyde and astringent.

658
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,844
感谢上帝
Thank God.

659
00:41:00,504 --> 00:41:02,038
不是她
It's not her.

660
00:41:08,943 --> 00:41:10,120
赶他们出去
Get them out.

661
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:12,425
你们已经打扰了死者的安息
You have violated the peace of the dead.

662
00:41:12,461 --> 00:41:14,525
你们现在该离开了
You will now leave.

663
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,002
她是谁
Who is she?

664
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,331
赶他们出去
Get them out.

665
00:41:17,368 --> 00:41:19,357
她的名字是Rose Spender
Her name is Rose Spender.

666
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,283
赶他们出去
Get them out.

667
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,002
她是我妻子的老护士
She is my wife's old nurse.

668
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,273
经在这个家已经有半个世纪了
She's been with the family for half a century.

669
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,916
两天前去世了
She died two days ago.

670
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:29,769
我们明天早上要埋葬她
We are to bury her tomorrow morning.

671
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:33,080
现在滚出去
Now, get out before I ask the police

672
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,308
趁我还没有叫来警察
you have summoned to my home

673
00:41:34,345 --> 00:41:36,790
统统把你们赶出去
to come in and throw you out.

674
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,444
我在想这个问题 福尔摩斯
I've been considering the problem, Holmes.

675
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:14,924
在我看来
It does seem to me that they

676
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:18,420
他们还没有谋杀Frances女士
could not have murdered Lady Frances

677
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:21,367
并把她的尸体藏进棺材里
and thought to have disposed of her body in that coffin

678
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:27,765
他们只是要埋葬一个老妇人
for they would then be faced with burying the old lady.

679
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:34,264
或许这个葬礼和
It may be that this burial has no connection

680
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:37,122
Frances女士的失踪没有关系
with Lady Frances' disappearance after all.

681
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,679
我说过 正如你所知 她是...
I mean she was, as you know, the most

682
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:44,610
...最难被人猜测行动的人
unpredictable creature.

683
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:47,354
也许她对Shlessinger的事又考虑过
It may be that she had second thoughts about Shlessinger.

684
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,946
她也许察觉到了此人
She may even have had some inkling

685
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:51,651
是我们所想之人
of the kind of man we believe him to be

686
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:53,795
离开了那里
and removed herself from the house.

687
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:56,916
毕竟 他很乐意让我们搜查
He was, after all, happy to let us search it.

688
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,175
你怎么想?
What do you think?

689
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:08,517
你的推理是什么
What is your theory then?

690
00:43:08,556 --> 00:43:10,285
我不知道
I have none.

691
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:16,472
没有足够的事实来进行推理
There are insufficient facts to construct a theory.

692
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:50,578
你觉得有东西被你忽略了吗
You think there's something you've overlooked?

693
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:28,184
延误了
<i>It's late.</i>

694
00:44:29,574 --> 00:44:31,956
早该到了
<i>Well, it should have been there before now.</i>

695
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:35,574
他们说比起普通的要花更多时间
<i>They say it took longer being out of the ordinary.</i>

696
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:52,093
上帝赐予我的大脑究竟怎么了
What has happened to any brains that God has given me.

697
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,164
华生
Watson.

698
00:44:57,283 --> 00:44:58,850
快点 伙计
Quick, man.

699
00:44:58,888 --> 00:45:02,652
现在是生死攸关 九死一生
It's life or death. A hundred chances on death and one on life.

700
00:45:11,098 --> 00:45:13,466
哦 万能的上帝 圣主啊
Oh, God most mighty, holy,

701
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,730
最仁慈的救世主
most merciful savior,

702
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:17,149
我们最可敬的不朽审判者
and our most worthy judge eternal,

703
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:21,014
请让我们在最后一刻安息...
suffer us not at our last hour for any plains of death...

704
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:32,846
...勿再延续
and never continuous in one stage.

705
00:45:32,884 --> 00:45:35,550
在生命之中 吾遭遇死亡
In the midst of life, we are in death.

706
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:39,306
于吾欲拯救 于汝 哦 主啊
Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, oh, Lord

707
00:45:39,342 --> 00:45:42,275
吾之罪不可恕
who for our sins are justly displeased.

708
00:45:42,313 --> 00:45:45,217
但是 主 上帝 最神圣的...
Yet, oh, Lord God, most holy...

709
00:45:54,662 --> 00:45:57,793
...我们亲爱的姐妹的灵魂已逝
the soul of our dear sister here departed,

710
00:45:57,832 --> 00:46:01,618
我们因此把她的肉体献给土地
we therefore commit her body to the ground.

711
00:46:05,559 --> 00:46:06,879
土归土
Earth to earth,

712
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:10,158
尘归尘
ashes to ashes,

713
00:46:10,698 --> 00:46:12,849
灰烟尽散
dust to dust

714
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:14,325
永世...
in sure and certain...

715
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:15,927
住手
Stop.

716
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:18,656
把棺材抬上来
Raise that coffin.

717
00:46:20,824 --> 00:46:22,962
你做的一切是要亵渎神灵吗
Whatever do you mean by this sacrilege?

718
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:24,846
谋生 先生
Murder, sir.

719
00:46:26,547 --> 00:46:28,885
我的意思是谋杀
Murder is what I mean.

720
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:30,561
对这么娇小的老妇人
Why such a deep coffin

721
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:32,880
为什么用这么深的棺材
for such a small old lady?

722
00:46:32,918 --> 00:46:34,155
给你们每人一枚金币
A sovereign to each of you

723
00:46:34,193 --> 00:46:36,954
如果能马上打开盖子
if you can lift the lid off that coffin in one minute.

724
00:46:49,995 --> 00:46:51,812
华生
Watson.

725
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:03,371
站住 不然我就开枪了
Stop or I'll shoot.

726
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:43,570
是氯仿
It's chloroform.

727
00:47:44,709 --> 00:47:47,450
她真的领教了坟墓的可怕
She's known literally the terrors of the grave.

728
00:47:47,488 --> 00:47:50,250
上帝知道这对她会有什么影响
God knows what this will have done to her.

729
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,265
我失败了
I've failed.

730
00:48:12,537 --> 00:48:14,292
我把她带回了这里
<i>I have brought her back here</i>

731
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,385
这个她童年时的乡村
<i>to the country of her childhood</i>

732
00:48:16,422 --> 00:48:19,720
也这星球上最美丽的地方之一
<i>which is one of the most beautiful on this planet.</i>

733
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:24,435
她的状况有了很大改善
<i>There has been a great improvement as a result.</i>

734
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:26,412
那些熟悉的风景
<i>A landscape so familiar</i>

735
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:28,297
让她倍感亲切
<i>and so intimate to her</i>

736
00:48:28,336 --> 00:48:31,761
我肯定有了朋友和家庭的陪伴
<i>will prompt in time a full response I feel sure</i>

737
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:34,671
一定会唤起她的全部反应
<i>as will the company of friends and family</i>

738
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:38,600
大家都非常地友善尽责
<i>who've all been most kind and dutiful.</i>

739
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:42,492
她可怜的哥哥 伯爵先生发狂了
<i>Her poor brother, the Earl,</i>

740
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:44,514
出于对那些罪犯的愤怒
<i>is beside himself with anger at the criminals</i>

741
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:47,269
也出于在这一切发生之前
<i>and with mortification at his having quarreled</i>

742
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:50,790
和Frances的那场争吵而感到悔恨
<i>with Frances before all this happened.</i>

743
00:48:52,293 --> 00:48:55,997
最后 请接受附寄的支票
<i>Finally, please accept the enclosed</i>

744
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,601
以表我的感激之情
<i>as a token of my gratitude</i>

745
00:48:57,638 --> 00:49:00,303
为你拯救了我亲爱的Frances
<i>for your saving of my dear Frances,</i>

746
00:49:00,342 --> 00:49:02,475
福尔摩斯先生
<i>Mr. Holmes,</i>

747
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:06,375
我期待能招待你和华生医生
<i>and I look forward to our entertainment <i>of you and Dr. Watson</i>

748
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:09,668
在不久的幸福未来
<i>in a happier future.</i>

749
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:11,666
我不能接受这个
I cannot accept it.

750
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:17,773
我拒绝因为造成了一个悲剧而被嘉奖
I refuse to be rewarded for fostering a tragedy.

751
00:49:17,773 --> 00:49:22,132
我从未这样无力过
I've never suffered such a complete eclipse of my faculties.

752
00:49:22,169 --> 00:49:24,542
说到无力 福尔摩斯
Well, like any eclipse, Holmes,

753
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,511
这只是暂时的
it's only temporary.

754
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:29,572
总有完全恢复的希望
There's every hope of a full recovery.

755
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:32,820
不见得
I wonder.

756
00:49:40,974 --> 00:49:42,859
不见得
I wonder.

757
00:49:48,467 --> 00:49:50,717
Frances?
Frances?

758
00:49:51,842 --> 00:49:54,521
