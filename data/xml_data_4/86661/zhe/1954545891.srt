00:00:20,956 --> 00:00:25,384

00:00:30,302 --> 00:00:35,497

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,352

5
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,512
华生
Watson,

6
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,334
"着魔"的医学术语是什么?
what is the medical term for an obsession?

7
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,305
知道吗 我觉得...
I feel you see,

8
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:04,894
我得去安葬一个鬼魂
that I must lay to rest a ghost

9
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:08,344
它跟着我有一阵子了
which has haunted me for some time.

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,329
我要出门几周
I shall be away for several weeks

11
00:01:18,406 --> 00:01:21,110
去苏格兰高地
in the highlands.

12
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:24,089
同时 看到你在诊室的时间变长
Meanwhile, your patience might be encouraged

13
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:26,767
你的病人也会受到鼓舞吧
by seeing you more often in your consulting room.

14
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,807
贝克街那边怎么办?
What about Baker Street?

15
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,760
邮件存在邮局里 有Diogenes俱乐部在 (福尔摩斯哥哥所在俱乐部)
Poste Restante, Diogenes Club,

16
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:34,306
一切照旧 你知道我的办案方法

17
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:38,197
我会时刻关注着你
I shall be watching you

18
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,148
用我的第三只眼

19
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:54,461

20
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:22,282
110克拉 先生
One hundred and ten carats, sir.

21
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,489
比"希望之星"还要大 (世上最著名的蓝钻 又被称为厄运之钻)
Bigger than the Hope diamond,

22
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:28,066
甚至比"光明之山"还大 (镶在伊丽莎白二世王冠上的钻石)
bigger even than the Koh-l-Noor.

23
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,829
难怪法国佬那么着急想把它要回去呢
No wonder the froggies are anxious to get it back.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,361
还有10分钟就要闭馆了 先生
Closing in 10 minutes, sir.

25
00:02:36,976 --> 00:02:38,147

这是我姐姐Agnes
This is my sister Agnes.

27
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:15,560
你没看出来
Do you not perceive

28
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:17,925
我们之间有明显的血缘关系吗?
a strong family resemblance between us?

29
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:19,354
就是骨架
It's the bone structure.

30
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:20,741
Garrideb家特有的

我们是伟大的Anglo-Saxon人的后裔

Did you say Garrideb?

38
00:03:37,696 --> 00:03:39,712
医生 我没有再三重复的习惯

她没有再三重复的习惯

40
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,777
我刚说过了 亲爱的Agnes
I've just said that, Agnes dear.

41
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:46,321
我姐姐听力不太好 你知道吧
My sister is a little hard of hearing, don't you know?

42
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:47,853
我大学里有一门课程
One of my university lectures

43
00:03:47,926 --> 00:03:50,073

45
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,448
你们是亲戚吗?
You're related?

46
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,607
他是我们的哥哥 叫Nathan
He is our brother, Nathan

47
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,659
正是因为他我们今天才会来这里
and the only reason for our presence here today.

48
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:01,280
他病了吗?
He's ill?

49
00:04:01,357 --> 00:04:03,060
-没有大碍 -没有
-Not inordinate. -No.

50
00:04:04,454 --> 00:04:06,850
那是你们之中的哪位病了?

51
00:04:06,924 --> 00:04:08,393
-啊 没有大碍 -一点没有
-Ah, not inordinately. -Not of any sort.

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,057
自从我跟我姐姐年轻时起
My sister and I have followed a strict regime

53
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:13,581
就遵守着一种
of clean, healthy living

54
00:04:13,618 --> 00:04:15,511
规律健康的生活习惯
since we were young girls.

55
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,285
我父亲不允许的
My father wouldn't allow it.

56
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:21,434
而且我们要求我们所有的先生们都照做
And we insist that all our gentlemen do the same.

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,888
你们的先生?
Your gentlemen?

58
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,187
我们的房客先生 华生医生
Our gentlemen tenants, Dr. Watson.

59
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:29,640
哦 明白了 你们出租房子?
Oh, I see you rent rooms?

60
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:32,348
不是随便租给任何人的 你明白吗?
Not to anybody, you understand?

61
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,898
我姐姐和我对于与我们
My sister and I are most particular

62
00:04:34,971 --> 00:04:37,224
同住一个屋檐下的人很挑剔
about who we have under our roof,

63
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,510
难道不是吗 Emily?
isn't that so, Emily?

64
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:39,656
我不太明白
I don't quite follow,

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,865
如果没人生病
if no one is ill,

66
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,606
那你们为什么来见我?
why do you come to see me?

67
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,535
我以为这很显然啊 医生
I thought that was obvious, Doctor.

68
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,156
我们有案子要找夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
We have a case for Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

69
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,208
Mycroft 醒醒
Mycroft, wake up.

70
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:12,885
Cantlemere?
Cantlemere?

71
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:17,490
在Diogenes俱乐部很少见到你啊
We don't often see you here at the Diogenes.

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,158
你依照要求跟你弟弟谈过了吗?
Have you spoken to your brother as requested?

73
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:22,114
哎呀 没有
Alas, no.

74
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,300
不必我提醒你
Well, I don't need to remind you

75
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,848
是谁发出的要求吧
from whence the request came.

76
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:29,352
这是首相先生的私人愿望
It is the Prime Minister's personal wish

77
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:34,183
希望你的弟弟能够运用他的侦查技巧
that your brother should employ his detective skills,

78
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,409
找到Mazarin钻石
find the Mazarin diamond

79
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,337
然后按时返还给白厅 (英国政府所在地)
and return it to White Hall without delay.

80
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:43,306
我恐怕夏洛克现在没空
I'm rather afraid Sherlock's unavailable at the present time.

81
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,217
没空?
Unavailable?

82
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,479
实在有点为难
Inconvenient I know,

83
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:49,484
但他正在苏格兰着手另一件案子
but he's engaged in another case up in the highlands,

84
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,253
大约一周内都回不来
don't expect to be back for about a week.

85
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,229
这样不行 Mycroft
Not good enough Mycroft,

86
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,286
你必须
you really must try

87
00:05:54,324 --> 00:05:57,197
让你弟弟赶回来
and keep your brother on a shorter leash.

88
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:01,502
你知道Mazarin钻石的历史吗?
Do you know the history of the Mazarin Diamond?

89
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:03,165
知道 我当然知道
Yes, of course I do,

90
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,739
它是以路易十四时代的首席部长
it was named after Cardinal Jules Mazarin,

91
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,811
Cardinal Jules Mazarina命名的
a Chief Minister during the reign of Louis the XIV,

92
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:10,689
现在属于女王陛下
it belongs now to Majesty of the Queen.

93
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:13,579
对 但马上就要被归还给法国
Yes, but it is soon to be returned to France

94
00:06:13,652 --> 00:06:16,225
作为英国人民
where it belongs as a goodwill gesture

95
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,921
友好的象征
on the part of the British people

96
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,362
我相信你也同意这样的象征
and I think you'll agree that such a gesture

97
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,027
肯定会巩固
can only help to cement

98
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,576
我们两国之间的关系
the relationship between our two 伯爵ries.

99
00:06:24,648 --> 00:06:26,936
如果我们现在食言
To go back on our word now

100
00:06:27,014 --> 00:06:29,587
将会招致外交危机
could spell diplomatic disaster.

101
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:32,814
首相请求你弟弟
The Prime Minister has asked that your brother

102
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,518
来调查这个案子
investigate this case

103
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,855
而且福尔摩斯先生 从未让他失望过
and Mr. Holmes has never, ever let him down.

104
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:40,512
我亲爱的Horatio
My dear Horatio,

105
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,078
如果夏洛克在这儿
if Sherlock were here,

106
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,856
我肯定他绝对十分乐意效劳
I'm sure he'd be more than delighted to assist.

107
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,647
至少 我想他会帮忙
At least, I think he would.

108
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:49,270
但你看他并不在这儿
But he's not here you see,

109
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:52,023
所以他无法效劳
so he can't,

110
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:54,605
但我可以
but I could,

111
00:06:54,677 --> 00:06:56,789
给我个机会
illuminate me.

112
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:05,841
他昨天来了
He came to the house yesterday.

113
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,825
谁来了?
Who did?

114
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:09,916
那个美国人
The American.

115
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:11,719
一个美国人到你家里
An American came to your house

116
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,291
拜访你哥哥
to visit your brother

117
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,795
然后要给他很多钱?
and offered him a large sum of money?

118
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,643
五百万美元
Five million dollars.

119
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,452
五百万美元?
Five million dollars?

120
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,262
三个人平分
Fifteen million dollars

121
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,356
一千五百万美元
to be divided between three people.

122
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,859
只要是姓Garrideb
With the same name, Garrideb.

123
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:30,029
但只有姓Garrideb的男人能分到财产
But only male Garridebs can share the fortune.

124
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,036
像我哥哥
Like my brother.

125
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:32,567
还有那个美国人
And the American.

126
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,398
但显而易见 医生
But it's as plain as a pikestaff, Doctor.

127
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,261
他根本就不姓Garrideb
He's not a real Garrideb at all.

128
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,062
他说他姓这个
Oh, he says he is

129
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,122
但我们不信 对吧 Emily
but we know otherwise, don't we, Emily.

130
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:50,696
凭什么不信?
You do, how?

131
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,782
骨架
Bone structure.

132
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,302
他就没有这种骨架
He simply doesn't have it.

133
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:54,516
没有
No.

134
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:56,363
当然啦
Of course.

135
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,793
骨架
Bone structure.

136
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,318
无论是谁干的 那人绝对是个恶棍
Whoever it is, the man's an absolute cad.

137
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:02,939
Mycroft 想想国家
Mycroft, think of the 伯爵ry.

138
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:06,207
想象一下如果找不到Mazarin钻石
Imagine if the Mazarin Diamond was never found.

139
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,603
或者再被发现时
Or turns up again

140
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,198
它已变成别的样子
in a variety of different shapes.

141
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:14,846
那么 女士们 失陪了
Now, ladies, if you'll excuse me

142
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:17,621
还有病人等着我呢
there are patients waiting to be seen.

143
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,813
这是我们的名片 医生
Here is our card, Doctor.

144
00:08:19,894 --> 00:08:22,182
你会为我们伸张正义
You will speak on our behalf,

145
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,259
是吗 医生? 拜托了
won't you, Doctor, please?

146
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,766
我会尽力的
I'll do what I can.

走吧 Agnes
Come along, Agnes.

150

他没有我原想的那么聪明

151
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:39,301
<i>Garrideb这个姓氏</i>

152
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:41,809
<i>或许对你们来说毫无意义</i>

153
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:44,238
<i>但我觉得我应该一一道明</i>
<i>but I feel I should relay the particulars</i>

154
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:46,328
<i>这桩神奇案件里的特别之处</i>
<i>of a most extraordinary tale.</i>

155
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:53,984
钻石被窃之前
How long had the diamond been exhibited

156
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,775
展出了多久?
before its theft?

157
00:08:56,151 --> 00:08:57,883
大约10年
Nearly 10 years.

158
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:59,657
在同一个玻璃橱中?
Inside the same glass case?

159
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,786
是的 据我所知
Yes, as far as we know.

160
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:07,039
这个锁被换过吗?
Has this lock ever been changed?

161
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:10,372
整个大门都被换过 福尔摩斯先生
The whole gate would have to be replaced, Mr. Holmes,

162
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,387
根本无机可乘
nothing was left to chance.

163
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,564
督察 无论谁来到这里
Inspector, whoever took the diamond

164
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:16,959
毫不费力地
was able to walk in here

165
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,843
谁取走了钻石
without any apparent difficulty

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,925
鉴于锁上没有任何印记或刮痕
since there were no marks or scratches on the lock

167
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,420
显然不是强行取走
to suggest it was forced,

168
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:25,268
因此我们可以得出结论
we may safely conclude

169
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:28,155
盗贼有钥匙
the thief had a key.

170
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:36,292
一旦进来
Once inside,

171
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:37,691
就能够轻而易举的
it would've been the work of a moment

172
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:38,870
敲碎容器
to smash the case

173
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,302
取走宝石
and remove the stone.

174
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:58,619
我想你不知道失窃案发生的确切时间 对吗?
I gather you were unconscious at the time of the theft, is that correct?

175
00:09:58,656 --> 00:10:00,167
是的 先生
That's right, sir.

176
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:01,525
那么...
So?

177
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,369
他袭击我的时候
Well, I was just seeing out the last of the public

178
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,522
我当时正要送走最后一批访客
and getting ready to lock up for the night

179
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,707
并准备上锁
when he came at me.

180
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:08,411
你看到他了吗?
You saw him?

181
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,021
没有 先生
No, sir,

182
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,331
在我要转身之前
before I could turn around

183
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,799
他猛击了我 我就倒下了
he clobbered me and I went down.

184
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:15,422
你似乎很肯定袭击者是位男性
You seem confident that your attacker was a male

185
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,956
并且是单独行动
who acted alone.

186
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:17,968
哦 我是这样猜想的 先生
Oh, I suppose so, sir,

187
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:20,141
但我无法断言
although I couldn't swear to it.

188
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:21,228
据我所知
As far as I knew

189
00:10:21,265 --> 00:10:24,208
伯爵走后 博物馆空无一人
the 伯爵 had gone and the museum was empty.

190
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:26,867
伯爵?
The 伯爵?

191
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,456
伯爵 Sylvius
The 伯爵 Sylvius

192
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:31,627
是袭击发生前 最后一位离开大楼的访客
was the last member of the public to leave the building before the attack happened.

193
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:37,049
Negreto Sylvius伯爵
伯爵 Negreto Sylvius

194
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:38,015
我们跟他谈过了
We've spoken to him,

195
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:40,049
他不记得看到任何异常
he remembers seeing nothing untoward.

196
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:40,950
他肯定这么说
He would.

197
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:44,114
而且部长亲自要求我不要查这条线索
And the Commissioner himself has asked me not to pursue that line of inquiry.

198
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,600
伯爵很幸运 先生
伯爵 was lucky, sir.

199
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,320
如果再多留一会儿
If he strayed any longer,

200
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,363
他可能也会遭到袭击
he might've got clobbered as well.

201
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,289
他来了 Nathan
Here he is Nathan.

202
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,823
哦 亲爱的
Oh, dear.

203
00:11:23,895 --> 00:11:25,424
哦 他没来 是吗?
Oh, he hasn't has he?

204
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:27,121
不 他来了
Yes, he has.

205
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:29,667
小Watkins
Young Watkins,

206
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:32,315
很高兴这么多年后再见到你
nice to see you after all these years.

207
00:11:32,386 --> 00:11:34,461
不用管我们 医生
Pay no regard, Doctor.

208
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:37,947
请坐 请坐 小Watkins
Well, sit you down, sit you down, young Watkins.

209
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:45,217
家族的物种 蝙蝠
A species of the family, vespertilionidae.

210
00:11:45,295 --> 00:11:47,406
我是在年轻时
I found him in a subterranean cavern

211
00:11:47,487 --> 00:11:49,918
去非洲东南部的Sofala旅行时
in my travels in Sofala in Southeast Africa

212
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,046
在一个地下洞穴里发现他的
in my younger days.

213
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:53,917
我现在当然不常出门了
I don't get out much now of course

214
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,903
老胳膊老腿不如当年啦
hands and legs aren't what they were.

215
00:11:55,978 --> 00:11:56,986
Nathan
Nathan,

216
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:00,117
华生医生是代表夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生来的
Dr. Watson is acting for Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

217
00:12:00,188 --> 00:12:02,785
他是要来跟你谈谈那位Garrideb先生的
He's come to talk about the other Mr. Garrideb,

218
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,634
而不是你那老胳膊老腿
not your hands and legs.

219
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,156
哦 在这儿呢
Oh, there it is,

220
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,056
告诉他那个美国人跟我们说什么了
tell him what the American told us.

221
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,384
我们的访客先是解释说
Our visitor started by explaining

222
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:15,733
任何来自于美国堪萨斯的人
that anyone from Kansas in the United States of America

223
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,029
都会认得这个名字
would recognize the name

224
00:12:18,108 --> 00:12:22,176
Alexander Hamilton Garrideb
Alexander Hamilton Garrideb.

225
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:25,061
他没有任何亲戚或家属
He had no kith nor kin

226
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:27,302
但他以自己姓氏的独特为自豪
but he took a kind of pride in the queerness of the name

227
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:28,987
正因为此 我们走到了一起
and that's what brought us together.

228
00:12:29,764 --> 00:12:32,279
一天 一位老者拜访了我
One day I had a visit from the old man.

229
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:35,375
他为能够找到同姓的人 而兴奋不已
He was tickled to death to find someone else with the same name

230
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,672
于是决定要找到
and dead set on finding out

231
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,973
世界上还有没有其他姓Garrideb的人
if there were any other Garridebs in the world

232
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:42,426
于是他请我再去找到一个
so he asked me to find him another.

233
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:45,463
我说我很忙
I said I was a busy man

234
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,640
不可能花时间
and couldn't spend my life

235
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,776
周游世界
hiking around the world

236
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:50,819
寻找其他姓Garrideb的人
in search of other Garridebs.

237
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:53,145
但在他死后
But when he died

238
00:12:53,217 --> 00:12:54,545
那是一年后
about a year later

239
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,540
他留下了堪萨斯州记录在案的 最为诡异的遗嘱
he left behind the queerest will ever filed in the state of Kansas.

240
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:03,061
他把他的财产分为三份
His property was divided into three parts

241
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:04,913
其中我得到一份
of which I was to have one,

242
00:13:05,361 --> 00:13:06,996
只要
on condition

243
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:09,562
我再找到两位Garrideb
that I found two Garridebs

244
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:10,797
他们将平分剩下的部分
who would share the remainder,

245
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,860
每人五百万美元
five million dollars each if it's a cent.

246
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,891
但除非我们三人齐聚
But we can't lay a finger on it

247
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:23,236
否则我们无法染指财产
until we all three stand in a row.

248
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:25,164
我完全不相信
I don't believe a word of it.

249
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:29,492
先生 整个美国都没有这个姓氏
Sir, there isn't one in the whole of the United States.

250
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,812
我仔仔细细调查过了
I went through it with a fine-tooth comb

251
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:34,289
而我也联系不到任何一位Garrideb
and never a Garrideb could I catch.

252
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:38,212
然后我决定到这片故土试一试
Then I decided to try the old 伯爵ry

253
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,122
果然
and sure enough,

254
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:44,434
伦敦电话号码簿上有你的名字
there was your name in the London telephone directory,

255
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:48,728
三位成年男子 先生
Three adult men sir.

256
00:13:50,144 --> 00:13:55,038
这正是Alexander Hamilton  Garrideb的遗嘱里指定的要求
That's what it specified in Alexander Hamilton Garrideb's will.

257
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:57,235
已有两位
Two down,

258
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:59,422
只差一人
one to go,

259
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:01,900
五百万美金
five million dollars,

260
00:14:01,937 --> 00:14:03,393
哈利路亚
hallelujah.

261
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:09,548
空前的财富
Unparalleled good fortune.

262
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,000
女性亲属不够资格
Female relatives are disqualified,

263
00:14:13,075 --> 00:14:16,359
这个世界上肯定还有 其他姓Garrideb的人
surely there must be some other Garridebs in the world.

264
00:14:16,484 --> 00:14:17,942
你怎么看?
What do you think?

265
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,682
你相信这个人的故事吗 Garrideb先生?
Well, do you believe this man's story, Mr. Garrideb?

266
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:21,610
哦 毫无疑问
Oh, without a doubt,

267
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:22,970
他看起来很诚实
he had an honest face.

268
00:14:23,007 --> 00:14:25,394
哦 真的吗 那人就是个无赖
Oh, really, the man's a rogue.

269
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,791
你的妹妹们有不同意见
Your sisters think otherwise.

270
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:31,182
Emily和Agnes读了 太多不切实际的小说
Emily and Agnes are inclined to read too much romantic fiction

271
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:34,251
总要在本应光明的地方寻找阴影
and inclined to find shadows where there should only be light.

272
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,088
胡说
Nonsense.

273
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,390
谢谢你的讲述 Garrideb先生
Well thank you for explaining Mr. Garrideb.

274
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,999
很高兴再次见到你 先生
It's been a great pleasure to see you again, sir.

275
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,955
Nathan 你真是...
Nathan, oh you're so...

276
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:48,319
你只要得出自己的结论就行了
Well you'll just have to draw your own conclusions.

277
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:49,922
如果那位
If as seems probable

278
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:51,833
美国的Garrideb看起来像是恶棍
this American Garrideb is a rogue

279
00:14:51,869 --> 00:14:53,920
那你们早就会跟他撇清关系了
then you may already have seen the last of him

280
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:55,450
但如果事情再有发展
but please, please let me know

281
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,665
请务必 务必告知我
if there are any further developments.

282
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:58,646
哦 我们会的
Oh, we shall.

283
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,006
再见 先生
Goodbye, sir.

284
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,968
再会吧 小Watkins
Good day, to you then, young Watkins.

285
00:15:04,643 --> 00:15:07,537
胡言乱语
Poppycock and balderdash.

286
00:15:07,914 --> 00:15:10,939
只消想想我用五百万美金 能够做些什么
Just think what I could do with five million dollars,

287
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:14,926
我拥有这整个国家 财富的核心
I've got the nucleus of a national collection.

288
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,972
我会是这个时代的Harris Sloan
I shall be the Harris Sloan of my age.

289
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,503
Mycroft Holmes
Mycroft, Holmes,

290
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:00,796
好吧 好吧
well, well,

291
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,887
先是警察
first the police

292
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,398
现在又是你
and now you.

293
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,755
你是来看我把Mazarin宝石藏在哪儿的吧?
You've come to find where I am hiding the Mazarin stone?

294
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:11,343
我可没料到你会承认 伯爵
I didn't expect a confession, 伯爵.

295
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:14,480
那你不会失望的
Then you won't be disappointed.

296
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:18,118
您请
Please, if you wish.

297
00:16:18,306 --> 00:16:19,678
小心
Be careful,

298
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:21,812
这是微利扳机 (一触即发的)
it's a hair trigger.

299
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:32,085
这是来自
They were a gift

300
00:16:32,123 --> 00:16:34,456
威尔士王妃的礼物
from the Princess of Wales.

301
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,220
如此的协调
Such balance,

302
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,889
如此的工艺
such workmanship.

303
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:40,898
如此美好的东西
A beautiful thing,

304
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,469
却奇怪地落入错误的人手中
it's strangely in the wrong hand.

305
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,801
是啊 她真是美轮美奂
Yes, she is extraordinarily beautiful.

306
00:16:52,058 --> 00:16:52,984
她?
She?

307
00:16:53,022 --> 00:16:55,030
钻石
The diamond.

308
00:16:55,191 --> 00:16:55,987
哦
Oh.

309
00:16:56,024 --> 00:16:58,750
我得说我很惊讶之前没有人
I must say I'm surprised no one has been tempted

310
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:01,498
试图把她从白厅偷走
to steal her away from Whitehall before.

311
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:04,287
我相信诱惑一直都在 伯爵
I'm sure the temptation was there, 伯爵.

312
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:08,267
只是缺少胆量和机会
All that was lacking was audacity and opportunity.

313
00:17:08,343 --> 00:17:11,905
胆量和机会
Ah, audacity and opportunity

314
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:13,344
还有动机
and motive.

315
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:17,281
好财与贪婪就是动机 伯爵
Avariciousness and greed are motives, 伯爵,

316
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,844
我确信你对这不陌生
I'm sure you're familiar with them.

317
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:23,034
警察十分相信
The police are satisfied

318
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:25,271
盗窃发生的时候
that I was away from the building

319
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:27,196
我在大楼之外
when the theft occurred.

320
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,356
接受事实吧
Que sera sera.

321
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:42,867
我会循着自己的线索调查
I'm following my own line of inquiry

322
00:17:43,173 --> 00:17:45,638
就像Minny Warrendove控告你
as my brother did with Miss Minny Warrendove

323
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:48,709
偷了她的珠宝时 我弟弟做的一样
when she accused you of stealing her jewels.

324
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,339
我问心无愧
My conscience is clear.

325
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:56,391
*我们的过去是无法分隔的二重体 Mycroft
Our past is an unresolved dual Mycroft.

326
00:17:57,336 --> 00:18:00,476
或许你对我怀有私人恩怨
You may hold some personal grievance against me

327
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,389
但那并不会赋予你
but that gives you no right

328
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:06,058
玷污我名誉的权力
to sully my good name and reputation.

329
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,702
这是我们之间的事 伯爵
This is between us, 伯爵,

330
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:14,373
你和我
you and me.

331
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:27,424
哦 原谅我
Oh do forgive me,

332
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:30,102
这是微力扳机 (一触即发)
it's a hair trigger.

333
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,821
需要我等着吗?
Should I wait?

334
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:01,572
不 不必
No, no that won't be necessary.

335
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:02,801
很好
Very well then.

336
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,998
走吧
Walk on.

337
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,428
<i>亲爱的福尔摩斯</i>
<i>My dear Holmes,</i>

338
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,653
<i>我同意五百万美金</i>
<i>I agree that five million dollars</i>

339
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,925
<i>是无法想象的慷慨数额</i>
<i>is an impossibly generous offer.</i>

340
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:19,200
<i>为了我过去的导师</i>

341
00:19:19,236 --> 00:19:22,222
<i>我希望这不会被证明是假的</i>
<i>I hope it doesn't prove to be false.</i>

342
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,688
很抱歉打扰你 医生
I'm sorry to disturb you, Doctor,

343
00:19:24,725 --> 00:19:27,323
有位Garrideb先生要见你
there's a Mr. Garrideb to see you.

344
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,207
谢谢 Hudson夫人 让他进来
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, show him in.

345
00:19:38,037 --> 00:19:40,401
抱歉 我以为是别人
Forgive me, I was expecting someone else.

346
00:19:40,438 --> 00:19:42,763
你以为是Nathan Garrideb吧
Mr. Nathan Garrideb I suppose.

347
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,781
你一定是Watkins医生吧
You must be, Dr. Watkins.

348
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:47,128
差不多
Close.

349
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:51,410
我能为你做些什么 Garrideb先生?
What can I do for you Mr. Garrideb?

350
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:53,863
首先 你可以停止干涉
For a start you can stop interfering in matters

351
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,772
完全与你无关的事情
that don't rightly concern you.

352
00:19:56,344 --> 00:19:57,524
抱歉
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:58,189 --> 00:20:00,162
我今天见了那位老人和他的妹妹们
I saw the old man and his sisters today

354
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,807
他们告诉我 你是代表夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
and they told me you were acting on behalf of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

355
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,900
并不是针对你个人 Garrideb先生
That's no reflection on you, Mr. Garrideb.

356
00:20:07,643 --> 00:20:10,035
福尔摩斯先生和我能够从
Mr. Holmes and I have means of getting information,

357
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,287
其他民众无法获取的渠道得到信息
which is not normally available to the public.

358
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,837
我不想警方插手私事
I don't want the police butting into private matter.

359
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:19,566
但肯定的是 我们越早找到
But surely the sooner we find

360
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:20,906
第三位Garrideb先生
a third male Garrideb

361
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,067
对所有人都越好
the better for all concerned.

362
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:27,841
那就不同了
Well, that puts it different.

363
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:30,892
如果你是乐于帮忙找到第三人
If you're content to help us find the third man,

364
00:20:31,472 --> 00:20:33,474
那我看不出有任何害处
well, I can't see any harm in that.

365
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:38,191
希望这样能让你安心 Garrideb先生
I hope I put your mind at rest, Mr. Garrideb.

366
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,874
John Garrideb
John Garrideb,

367
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:44,413
如果我刚才对你有任何唐突 那很抱歉 Watkins医生
I'm sorry if I was a bit short with you back there, Dr. Watkins?

368
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,306
叫我华生就行
Watson, it's quite all right.

369
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:48,349
我对这个国家完全不熟悉
I'm fairly new to this 伯爵ry

370
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:51,068
还没适应你们英国人的方式
and haven't gotten used to your English ways yet.

371
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,245
我想对你这样 温文尔雅而又单纯的人来讲
I guess I must seem impatient to a man like yourself,

372
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:57,654
我肯定看起来很没耐心
urbane and unsophisticated.

373
00:20:57,691 --> 00:21:00,024
希望你的搜寻顺利 Garrideb先生
Good luck with your search, Mr. Garrideb,

374
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:03,729
如果我发现任何有用的消息 我会通知你
I'll be in touch if I discover anything useful.

375
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:05,382
万分感激 医生
Much obliged, Doctor,

376
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:07,932

<i>John Garrideb穿着一件英国的外套</i>

378
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,414
<i>肘部和裤子上有磨损</i>

379
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,129
<i>膝部有松弛下垂 说明至少穿了一年</i>
<i>bagged at the knees with at least a year's wear.</i>

380

<i>尽管他那么说</i>

381
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:30,453
<i>但我打赌他不是刚刚来到这个国家</i>
<i>I'll wager that he hasn't just arrived in this 伯爵ry.</i>

382
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:32,703
你应该不会拒绝与
You would hardly refuse to trade

383
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,354
手里有质量上乘的钻石的人 做交易吧?
with someone who possessed a diamond of exceptional quality?

384
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:40,309
看情况 Mycroft先生
That depends Mr. Mycroft.

385
00:21:40,345 --> 00:21:41,817
看什么情况?
Oh, on what?

386
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:44,999
当然是钻石的情况
The providence of the diamond of course.

387
00:21:45,062 --> 00:21:46,733
它的合法性
It's legality.

388
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,718
哪怕是由社会上一名
Even if it were brought to you

389
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:52,890
受尊敬的人士拿来的也是如此?
by a respectable member of society?

390
00:21:52,926 --> 00:21:55,951
即便女王陛下拿她的王冠来
Her majesty could offer me the crown jewels

391
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:59,796
我也一样拒绝与她交易
and I'd still refuse to do business with her.

392
00:22:01,937 --> 00:22:03,748
难以想像
Strange to think

393
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,602
那些结晶的碳块
that pieces of crystallized carbon

394
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:11,507
能够成为人类巨大幸福与灾祸的来源
could be the cause of such great human happiness and tragedy.

395
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:20,326
有些事最好在私下讲 Mycroft先生
Some things are better said in private, Mr. Mycroft.

396
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:21,728
你了解吗?
You do understand?

397
00:22:21,766 --> 00:22:23,533
我想我们都很了解对方
I think we understand each other,

398
00:22:23,569 --> 00:22:25,408
你有一份声誉很好的生意
you have a reputable business,

399
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:28,585
无法承受错误的发生
you can't afford to make mistakes.

谁?

叫什么?
And his name?

Sylvius伯爵
伯爵 Sylvius.

410
00:22:58,683 --> 00:23:01,058
这样我不能接受Ikey
Hmm, well that's no good to me,Ikey

411
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,262
我两天内要货
I need them within two days.

能够在一周内切割好您的钻石

415
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,629
但他把他的手艺带进坟墓里去了
and he took his skills with him to the grave.

416
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,339
那么我最好在还有时间的时候
Well, then I better find someone alive

417
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:18,124
找个活人把这活儿给干了
to do the work while there is still time.

418
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,393
你还能找谁
What can you do?

419
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:23,137
谁是Roger Presbury?
Who was Roger Presbury?

420
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:25,613
啊 一个真正的天才

421
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:28,919
一个没有生命 毫不成形的石头在他手里
In his hands a lifeless, shapeless stone

422
00:23:28,956 --> 00:23:32,004
能够变成活生生的能够呼吸的艺术品

423
00:23:32,418 --> 00:23:34,059
钻石就是他的生命
Diamonds were his life.

424
00:23:34,096 --> 00:23:35,828
而他也因此而死
And his death.

425

427
00:23:44,052 --> 00:23:46,135
如此的惨剧
Ah, such a tragedy.

428
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:48,591
你看到伯爵的钻石了吗?
Did you see the 伯爵's diamond?

429
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,183
哎呀 没有
Alas, no,

430
00:23:50,587 --> 00:23:54,256
但他给我描述了一下
but he did give me a description of it.

431
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:56,226
他描述的是圆形的宝石
He described a round stone

432
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,858
有着最上乘的纯度与颜色
of finest purity and color,

是110 Mycroft先生
A hundred and ten, Mr. Mycroft,

435
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:07,230
未免与Mazarin宝石的特征
but a little too close for comfort

436
00:24:07,267 --> 00:24:11,623
也太相近了
to a description of the Mazarin stone.

437
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,500
我已经耽误你太久了
I've taken up enough of your time.

438
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:16,040

你对于伯爵的厌恶是众所周知的

444

但个中缘由却不为人知
unlike your reasons.

445
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:44,577
他让我们社会上层阶级
He brings the higher echelons of our society

446
00:24:44,614 --> 00:24:47,011
丧失名誉
into disrepute.

447
00:24:47,048 --> 00:24:49,297
那是你的个人观点
In your opinion.

448
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,182
哦 我想你知道
Oh, I suppose you realize

449

And the Prince and Princess of Wales

are unlikely to entertain suspected criminals, are they?

454
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,079
走吧 George
Drive on, George.

455
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,574

你真是个无可救药的奉承者 Sylvius伯爵
You are an incorrigible flatterer, 伯爵 Sylvius

伯爵 是这样
Now 伯爵,

你是个玩牌的人
you are a card player,

537
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,477
当对方掌握着所有的王牌
when the other fellow has all trumps

538
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:53,993
弃牌投降比较省时
it saves time to put down one's hand.

这些跟Mazarin宝石有什么关系?

珠宝商说要花数周

不过杀了他的人可能还活着

560

他提到微力扳机是什么用意?
What does he mean by hair trigger?

561
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:14,075
他在暗示我会死于非命

这些是Roger Presbury的验尸照片

你一定很习惯于这种景象 医生

还有Garrideb小姐

622
00:35:38,795 --> 00:35:41,958
华生 你能护送这两位女士回家吗

623
00:35:42,031 --> 00:35:43,762
我有要事要办
I have urgent business to attend to.

00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,822
我随后去找你
I'll follow you later.

我会试着说服Nathan
I'll try to persuade Nathan

626
00:35:48,503 --> 00:35:50,199
不要去伯明翰

00:35:50,277 --> 00:35:51,665
我们十分感激
We should be so grateful.

628
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,064
那会对他的健康造成不可弥补的损害
It could cause irreparable damage to his health.

629
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:55,491
打扰了 女士们
Forgive me, ladies,

630
00:35:55,566 --> 00:35:57,784
我有幸能够见到
two of the finest detectives

631
00:35:57,863 --> 00:36:00,560
两位最高明的侦探
it's ever been my privilege to meet.

632
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:04,429
哦 有趣的怪人
Oh, such a card.

633
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:10,903
我真的非常遗憾
I really am very sorry.

634
00:36:11,677 --> 00:36:15,582
覆水难收 Mycroft先生
What's done is done, Mr. Mycroft.

635
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:19,085
Van Seddar正在伦敦
Van Seddar is in London,

636
00:36:19,158 --> 00:36:21,827
他打算在明晚前
he plans to return to Amsterdam

637
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:24,019
回阿姆斯特丹
before tomorrow night.

638
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,452
谁是Van Seddar?
Who is Van Seddar?

639
00:36:25,526 --> 00:36:27,470
他在泰晤士河上有条船
He has a boat down on the Tames,

640
00:36:27,544 --> 00:36:29,655
我不知道在哪儿
I don't know where.

641
00:36:29,736 --> 00:36:32,310
他要带...
He will take...

642
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:38,075
他要带Mazarin钻石去阿姆斯特丹
he will take the Mazarin stone to Amsterdam.

643
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:40,374
你确定钻石还没被切割吗?
Are you sure the stone hasn't been cut?

644
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:44,036
啊 是这样 你看
Ah, well, you see,

645
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:48,210
它可以被切开
it can be cleaved,

646
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:52,553
只需一下就能切下一粒
split down the grain with a single blow.

647
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:53,770
Presbury的助手
Would Presbury's assistant

648
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,433
掌握了切开大钻石的工艺吗?
have the necessary skill to cleave a large diamond?

649
00:36:57,504 --> 00:37:01,394
别人可能会信
He may convince others that he has,

650
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,017
但我不信
but not me.

651
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,758
那人是个罪犯 Garrideb先生
The man is a criminal, Mr. Garrideb.

652
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:09,191
而他就不存在
But he doesn't exist.

653
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:10,368
哦
Oh.

654
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:12,180
胡言乱语
Poppycock and balderdash.

655
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:15,038
-他就不存在 -我们已经告诉你了
-He doesn't exist. -We've been trying to tell you that,

656
00:37:15,111 --> 00:37:17,370
-不是吗 Emily? -胡说 你们就是嫉妒
-haven't we, Emily? -Nonsense, you're jealous

657
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:20,028
因为我马上就要得到五百万美元了
because I'm about to be handed five million dollars.

658
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:21,372
我没有权力劝诫您
I have no right to indulge

659
00:37:21,444 --> 00:37:23,947
但这是我的专业意见 Garrideb先生
but it's my professional advice, Mr. Garrideb

660
00:37:23,983 --> 00:37:26,550
您不应该去伯明翰
that you should not travel to Birmingham.

661
00:37:26,628 --> 00:37:28,431
让开 小Watkins
Out of my way, young Watkins,

662
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,833
除非你想被踩着
unless you wish to be trampled underfoot.

663
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:33,926
等我明天回来时
When I return tomorrow,

664
00:37:34,006 --> 00:37:36,223
我就成了有钱人了
I shall be a wealthy man,

665
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,369
Houston
Houston.

666
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,655
医生 我姐姐和我马上就要睡了
Doctor, my sister and I will have to retire shortly.

667
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:47,356
如果你要就寝的话
We have plenty of spare beds

668
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:50,553
-我们这儿有很多空床 医生 -不 不
-if you wish to sleep, Doctor. -No, no, please, please

669
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,789
不用担心我 Garrideb小姐
don't worry about me, Miss Garrideb,

670
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:54,180
我就呆在这儿
I'll just stay there.

671
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:55,952
哦 那么
Oh, well then,

672
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,584
有很多垫子
plenty of cushions.

673
00:37:57,666 --> 00:38:00,336
我们把这些堆起来 更舒服点
Let's plump them up a little more comfortable,

674
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,067
肯定的
I'm sure.

675
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,683
不 不用 别让我
No, no please don't let me...

676
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:04,964
别因为我让你们睡不成觉
don't let me keep you awake.

677
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:07,025
我把窗帘给你拉上 医生
I'll just draw the curtains for you, Doctor.

678
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:09,242
哦 不 不用 不用 这样就行
Oh, no, please, please, it's fine.

679
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:12,240
随意用茶和点心 好吗 医生
You will help yourself to tea and cake, won't you, Doctor.

680
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,297
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

681
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,646
如果你想要的话 还有点雪利酒
Or there's a little sherry if you prefer,

682
00:38:15,725 --> 00:38:16,969
别客气
don't hesitate.

683
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:19,407
实际上 我只要...
In fact I might just...

684
00:38:19,484 --> 00:38:21,465
来吧 Emily宝贝
Come along, Emily dear.

685
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:24,900
晚安 医生
I bid you goodnight then, Doctor.

686
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,226
晚安
Goodnight.

687
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,251
都走了是吧?
All clear.

688
00:38:39,289 --> 00:38:40,378
是的
Yes.

689
00:38:40,466 --> 00:38:41,945
很好
Splendid.

690
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:52,254
多么诡异的房间
What an extraordinary room.

691
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:56,544
恐怕Garrideb先生已经在去伯明翰的路上了
I'm afraid Mr. Garrideb is on his way to Birmingham.

692
00:38:56,924 --> 00:38:58,862
哦 那很好
Oh, that's excellent.

693
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:19,876
这比我料想的更严重 华生
This is much more serious than I thought, Watson.

694
00:39:21,073 --> 00:39:23,055
你可能需要这个
You may need this.

695
00:39:29,528 --> 00:39:31,970
熄灭蜡烛 华生
Dowse the candles, Watson.

696
00:39:34,609 --> 00:39:36,225
那是雪利酒吗?
Is that sherry?

697
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:37,948
是的
Yes.

698
00:40:28,996 --> 00:40:31,012
这雪利酒还不坏
Not bad this sherry.

699
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,420
我想你是James Winter吧
James Winter I presume.

700
00:42:33,635 --> 00:42:34,838
华生
Watson!

701
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:37,932
我没事
I'll be all right?

702
00:42:38,716 --> 00:42:40,818
我看到他手里有枪
I saw the gun in his hand.

703
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,228
我没...
I didn't...

704
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:45,810
你找错人了
You got the wrong man.

705
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:48,800
我想没有 Winter先生
I think not, Mr. Winter.

706
00:42:48,877 --> 00:42:50,335
这是Presbury的主意
It was Presbury's idea.

707
00:42:50,407 --> 00:42:52,388
Presbury已经死了
Presbury's dead.

708
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:54,784
是他活着时的主意 先生
When he was alive, sir.

709
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:56,735
你得相信我
You've got to believe me.

710
00:42:56,809 --> 00:43:00,035
他三年里每周都去博物馆
He went to the museum every week for three years,

711
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:03,802
就为了找到偷Mazarin宝石的方法  然后切割它
all the while figured out a way to steal the Mazarin stone and hack it up.

712
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,046
复制一把钥匙很简单
Making the duplicate key was easy.

713
00:43:06,638 --> 00:43:08,733
他死前没有机会实施这个计划
Before he had a chance to use it he died.

714
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:10,167
因为那把钥匙 他被杀了
He was murdered for that key.

715
00:43:10,241 --> 00:43:12,316
不是我杀的 先生
Not by me, sir.

716
00:43:12,398 --> 00:43:14,414
抱歉 医生
I'm sorry, Doctor.

717
00:43:14,486 --> 00:43:15,945
我在法庭上就是这么跟陪审团说的
I told the jury so at the trial.

718
00:43:16,017 --> 00:43:18,614
我们只是对珠宝起了争执
It was some argument over jewelry

719
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:20,605
但他们不相信我说的
but they didn't believe me.

720
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,084
是你偷了Mazarin宝石吗?
Did you steal the Mazarin stone?

721
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,626
不 先生 不是我
No, sir, I did not.

722
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:31,284
我不是故意打你的 抱歉
I didn't mean to hit you, I'm sorry.

723
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:33,958
那是谁干的?
Then who did?

724
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:36,058
杀Presbury的凶手
Presbury's murderer,

725
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:37,374
是除我以外唯一知道
the only other man

726
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:39,598
偷宝石计划的人
who knew of this plan to steal it

727
00:43:39,678 --> 00:43:40,736
也是唯一冷酷到
and the only man cool enough

728
00:43:40,773 --> 00:43:42,143
能够从白厅偷走钻石的人
to take a diamond out of Whitehall.

729
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,915
也是让你遭受
And the man for whom you spent

730
00:43:43,993 --> 00:43:47,884
五年牢狱之灾的人
five years of your life behind bars.

731
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,356
我们适合在一起合作
It suited us both to work together.

732
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:57,274
来 让我帮你
Please, let me help you.

733
00:43:57,354 --> 00:43:58,492
他能偷走它
He could steal it

734
00:43:59,591 --> 00:44:02,286
而我可以用Presbury的工具
and I could use Presbury's equipment

735
00:44:02,365 --> 00:44:04,001
进行快速切割
to cut it up fast.

736
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:11,419
但Nathan Garrideb碍事了 对吧?
But Nathan Garrideb was in the way, hmm?

737
00:44:13,848 --> 00:44:17,161
是的 而我是唯一
Yeah, and I was the only one

738
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:19,455
知道那个工坊位置的人
who knew the location of his workshop.

739
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:22,028
你知道吗 我想要来这里
Can you wonder I wanted to get to it.

740
00:44:22,547 --> 00:44:25,160
你知道吗 当我找到这里
And can you wonder when I found this

741
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:27,814
发现这个又疯又蠢的昆虫学家
crazy boob of a bug hunter

742
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,679
正端坐在那上面
squatting right on top of it.

743
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,635
又从不离开自己房间
And never quitting his room,

744
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,539
所以我想方设法地要支走他
why I had to do all I could to shift him.

745
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:35,014
老实点
Easy.

746
00:44:37,789 --> 00:44:40,285
干掉他要简单多了
It would've been a whole lot easier to put him away

747
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:42,687
但我是个软心肠
but I'm a softhearted guy,

748
00:44:45,409 --> 00:44:47,291
像你们的拜伦勋爵所说
as your Lord Byron said,

749
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:49,499
"他有着最和善的心肠"
"he was the mildest mannered man,

750
00:44:49,536 --> 00:44:50,989
"永远不忍割开咽喉"
who ever cut a throat."

751
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:52,363
Mazarin宝石在哪儿?
Where is the Mazarin stone?

752
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,649
我的同伴正要把它带到这儿来
My associate is bringing it here with him

753
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:58,021
但我想我们得先切开它
but I guess now we'll have to forego cleaving it

754
00:44:58,058 --> 00:45:00,278
再运到阿姆斯特丹去
before shipping it to Amsterdam.

755
00:45:00,315 --> 00:45:02,247
Van Seddar吗?
By Van Seddar?

756
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:05,624
对啊
Yes.

757
00:45:06,565 --> 00:45:11,129
它已经在去阿姆斯特丹的路上了
It's already on its way to Amsterdam.

758
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,139
你的同伙背叛了你
Your associate has betrayed you

759
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:16,366
就像他之前背叛别人一样
just as he's betrayed so many others.

760
00:45:16,447 --> 00:45:19,293
我和他有约定
He and I made a deal,

761
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:21,801
而君子一向遵守诺言
and a gentleman always keeps his word.

762
00:45:48,771 --> 00:45:51,309
上路吧 Van Seddar
(unintelligible) Van Seddar.

763
00:45:54,026 --> 00:45:54,890
不 别 别
No, please, please.

764
00:45:54,927 --> 00:45:56,383
该给你找个医生吗 医生?
Shall I get a doctor, Doctor?

765
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,400
不 不 给我条毛巾
No, no, just get me a towel

766
00:45:58,481 --> 00:46:00,070
还有水就行 谢谢
and some water, please, thank you.

767
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:04,497
你的同伙利用了你 Winter
Your associate has used you, Winter.

768
00:46:04,744 --> 00:46:07,376
他本来就没打算让你
He had no intention of allowing you

769
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:10,000
切割钻石
to cleave the stone.

770
00:46:10,037 --> 00:46:12,376
你已经完成了你的使命
You'd served your purpose.

771
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:17,646
那么 Van Seddar的船在哪儿
Now, where is Van Seddar's boat?

772
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,005
我的兄弟
Brother mine.

773
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:34,691
棒极了
Bravo.

774
00:51:38,001 --> 00:51:42,637
