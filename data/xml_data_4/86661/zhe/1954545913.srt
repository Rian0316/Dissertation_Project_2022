1
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,400

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,300

3
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,300

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
(意大利语)

5
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:28,013
你在那干吗 倍波
What are you doing down there Beppo.

6
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:30,793
(意大利语)

7
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,565
后退
Stand back

8
00:04:57,637 --> 00:04:59,689
我们抓着他了
we have him at last.

9
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,656
(意大利语)

10
00:06:07,488 --> 00:06:09,955
(意大利语)

11
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:34,838
六座拿破仑半身像
The Six Napoleons

12
00:06:58,231 --> 00:07:00,900
手上有什么不寻常的案子吗 雷斯垂德
Anything remarkable on hand, Lestrade?

13
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:08,593
没有
No.

14
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,412
没什么特别的案子
Nothing in particular.

15
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,091
那跟我们说说
Then tell us about it.

16
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,800
既然你提到了 福尔摩斯先生
Now you've come to mention it, Mr. Holmes.

17
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:49,697
不否认我确实有心事
There's no denying there is something on my mind.

18
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:55,578
四天前我接到第一个报案 引起了我注意
It first came to my notice four days ago.

19
00:07:55,657 --> 00:07:59,030
冒斯・贺得逊在康宁顿路
A certain Morse Hudson has a shop

20
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:00,881
有家商店
for the sale of pictures and statues

21
00:08:00,882 --> 00:08:02,572
出售图画和雕塑
in Kennington Road.

22
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,651
可昨晚发生了一件更严重
But what happened last night was more serious

23
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:37,520
也很特别的事
and also more singular.

24
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:43,261
入室行窃
Burglary.

25
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,044
没错
Exactly.

26
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:50,322
有人闯入了巴尔尼柯大夫的家
A house of a Doctor Barnicot was broken into.

27
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,645
这个半身像是巴尔尼柯大夫
Now this bust was one of a pair

28
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,420
从冒斯・贺得逊店
purchased from Morse Hudson

29
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,843
购买的其中一个
by Doctor Barnicot.

30
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,873
一个放在了家里
He had put it in his house.

31
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:16,633
另一个放在了离家两里外的诊所里
The other he put two miles away in his surgery.

32
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:19,420
就在那一晚的稍后
Later that same night.

33
00:09:29,174 --> 00:09:31,747
这还真的挺奇怪
This is certainly very novel.

34
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:33,348
是啊 所以我想你可能会感兴趣
Yes, I thought it would please you.

35
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:35,153
虽然我觉得这可能属于
Though in my opinion it comes more into

36
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,863
华生大夫的领域
Doctor Watson's line than ours.

37
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:40,163
疾病?
Disease?

38
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:42,424
我觉得是精神病
I should say madness.

39
00:09:42,504 --> 00:09:44,972
而且还是奇怪的疯病
Queer sort of madness too.

40
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,705
你能想象的到么 现在的人们
You wouldn't think there was anybody living,

41
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:48,517
当今社会的人 谁会如此地
now days would you,have such a hatred

42
00:09:48,594 --> 00:09:50,990
憎恨波拿巴・拿破仑
for Napoleon Bonaparte.

43
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:54,039
事实上 一些偏执狂
Actually there are no limits

44
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,418
是很有可能的
to the possibilities of monomania.

45
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,103
有一种情况
You see there is the condition

46
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,714
法国心理学家
that the modern French psychologists

47
00:10:01,785 --> 00:10:03,932
称为"偏执的意念"
have called a 'idee fixe, '

48
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:07,618
如果一个人太沉迷于
if someone became obsessed with say,

49
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:09,753
比如 他的祖先告诉他的
an injustice committed to an ancestor

50
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,628
有关拿破仑战争时期的不公
during the Napoleonic wars,

51
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,923
他很可能就形成了"偏执的意念"
he might form 'idee fixe',

52
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:15,804
在这种意念的影响下
and under its influence

53
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:19,560
他可能会变得狂躁
he might be capable of any fantastic outrage.

54
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:24,123
亲爱的华生 这种解释行不通
My dear Watson,that won't do.

55
00:10:24,198 --> 00:10:26,216
那你怎么解释
How do you explain it then?

56
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:28,054
我不想解释
I don't attempt to do so.

57
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,756
看到了吧
There you see.

58
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,654
我只是观察到
I would simply observe

59
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,123
这位绅士的疯狂举动
that there's a certain method

60
00:10:35,196 --> 00:10:37,249
也有一定的规律
in this gentleman's eccentric madness.

61
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:38,707
例如
I mean for example,

62
00:10:38,782 --> 00:10:41,107
在巴尔尼柯大夫的房子里
in Dr. Barnicot's house,

63
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,914
一点声音可能
where a sound might have

64
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:44,380
就惊醒全家人
aroused the sleeping family,

65
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:45,807
半身像是先拿到外面
the bust was taken outside

66
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,270
再被打碎的
before being broken,

67
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,552
然而在诊所里
whereas in his surgery,

68
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:50,125
危险就小多了
where there was less danger of alarm,

69
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:51,620
半身像就在原地被打碎了
it was smashed where he stood.

70
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:54,644
我提到这些
I only mentioned it

71
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,110
是因为你总会察觉到
because you usually have a taste

72
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:57,736
看似寻常的
for all that is out of the common,

73
00:10:57,818 --> 00:10:59,170
琐碎细节
no matter how trivial.

74
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,941
我不会把任何事看得琐碎无关 雷斯垂德
I dare call nothing trivial, Lestrade.

75
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:02,408
我一些经典案件
Some of my most classic cases

76
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,320
都是从小细节开始的
have had the least promising commencement.

77
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,642
是啊
Yeah.

78
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,594
阿伯涅特家的恐怖事件
That dreadful business of the Abernetty family.

79
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:11,921
我可没有把全家人的
I hardly call the dismemberment

80
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,271
碎尸案看作琐碎小事
of an entire family trivial.

81
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,902
华生 你愿意解释下吗
Well Watson, would you be so kind as to explain?

82
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:20,676
什么
What?

83
00:11:20,755 --> 00:11:22,415
那个案子能够破案就是
Well the point is that

84
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:24,462
因为福尔摩斯注意到了
it only came to Holmes' notice

85
00:11:24,463 --> 00:11:26,410
热天里芹菜在黄油里
because the depths which the parsley had sunk

86
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,991
会沉得多深而已
into the butter on a hot day.

87
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:34,638
所以 我不能对三个半身像事件
So you see I cannot afford to smile

88
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,858
一笑置之 雷斯垂德
at your three busts, Lestrade.

89
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:40,023
不过 要是你让我知道
However, I would be obliged

90
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:41,207
事件的进展
if you would keep me informed

91
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:43,435
我会深深感谢你的
as to developments.

92
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,440
听这个 福尔摩斯 立刻到
Listen to this Holmes Come Instantly,

93
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:00,592
肯辛顿彼特街131号来
1-3-1 Pitt Street, Kensington.

94
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:01,954
雷斯垂德
Lestrade.

95
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:03,134
是什么事
What's it about?

96
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:03,885
什么事都可能
Well it could be anything

97
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,927
不过我想可能是
but I suspect it's a sequel

98
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:07,247
昨晚他的故事有新进展
to his story of last night,

99
00:12:07,322 --> 00:12:09,611
我的"偏执的意念" 把咖啡喝完
you know my 'idee fixe. 'Finish your coffee

100
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:12,121
楼下有马车等着
there's a cab at the door.

101
00:12:12,193 --> 00:12:14,376
只给你两分钟
Two minutes.

102
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:31,848
至少是件谋杀未遂案
It's attempted murder at least.

103
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:33,837
这下伦敦的报童可要被团团围住了
Nothing less will hold the London message boy.

104
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:35,441
那个年轻人蜷缩着肩膀
There's a deed of violence

105
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:36,793
伸长着脖子
in that young fellow's round shoulders

106
00:12:36,869 --> 00:12:38,329
所以一定是发生了打斗
and outstretched neck.

107
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:40,239
雷斯垂德会告诉我们的
Well, Lestrade will soon tell us.

108
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:47,823
看看这些 华生
Look at this, Watson.

109
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:50,893
下面的台阶都冲刷过 其他的还是干的
The bottom steps swilled down and the others dry.

110
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:52,388
很多脚印
Footsteps enough, anyhow.

111
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:54,406
是谁的呢
Yes, but whose?

112
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:05,578
又是拿破仑半身像的案件
It's the Napoleon bust business again, gentlemen.

113
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,905
又被打碎了?
They smashed another?

114
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:09,443
恐怕事情
I 'm afraid the affair

115
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:12,114
已经发展到很严重的地步了
has taken a graver turn.

116
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:14,105
这边来
This way.

117
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:22,555
哈克先生 请容许我介绍
Mr. Harker, allow me to present,

118
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:25,863
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生 华生大夫
Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.

119
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:29,313
中央报刊辛迪加的贺拉斯・哈克先生 
Mr. Horace Harker, of the Central Press Syndicate.

120
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:33,280
很高兴你们能来
Good of you to come, gentlemen.

121
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,337
对于我的焦躁 请见谅
Please forgive my agitation.

122
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,320
没必要道歉 哈克先生
No apology necessary,Mr. Harker.

123
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,428
一具尸体躺在门前
A body on one's front doorstep

124
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,320
谁都会不安的
is always unsettling.

125
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,613
你已经告诉他们了?
You've told him then?

126
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,974
一个字都没说
Not a word.

127
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:54,165
你们快告诉我们到底发生了什么
Now tell us exactly what occurred.

128
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:57,335
这事很不寻常
It's an extraordinary thing.

129
00:13:57,405 --> 00:13:58,934
我的一生
All my life I 've been

130
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,595
都是在收集别人的新闻
collecting other people's news,

131
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,337
而现在我身上也发生了件真正的新闻
and now I have a real life story of my own

132
00:14:02,416 --> 00:14:05,513
我却一个字都写不出来了
and I can't put two words together.

133
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:08,921
如果我以记者的身份
If I had been a journalist

134
00:14:08,994 --> 00:14:10,382
来到这里的话
and walked in through that door

135
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:11,879
我将自己采访自己了
I would have interviewed myself

136
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:15,252
还要在伦敦报上写两栏报道
and had two columns in every London newspaper.

137
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,329
现在我不得不放弃这么有价值的新闻
And here I am giving away valuable copy

138
00:14:18,331 --> 00:14:19,320
一遍遍地
by telling my story

139
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,990
向不同的人们
over and over again

140
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:23,468
讲述我的故事
to a string of different people.

141
00:14:25,527 --> 00:14:27,436
不过 我听过你的大名
However, I 've heard of your name,

142
00:14:27,511 --> 00:14:29,243
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

143
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,583
要是你能解释这件怪事
so if you could explain this queer business

144
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,738
我的辛苦
I'd be more than paid for my trouble

145
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,181
也没白费
in telling you my story.

146
00:14:41,884 --> 00:14:43,829
我通常要在书房里
A great deal of my journalistic work

147
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:46,642
写稿到深夜
is done at night in my den,

148
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:50,958
在那个屋子 离这很近
in that room adjacent to this one.

149
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:53,018
不知什么时候
At some time

150
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,724
大概是清晨吧
in the small hours of this morning.

151
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:41,639
那一刻将不断地
I shall live that moment

152
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:44,904
在我梦中出现
over and over again in my dreams.

153
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,713
知道被害者是谁么
Do we know who the murdered man was?

154
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:53,086
还不知道 如果你想看尸体
Not yet but you can see the body at the mortuary,

155
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:55,037
可以去停尸房
if you wish.

156
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:58,102
哈克先生 你从哪买的半身像
Where did you purchase your bust, Mr. Harker?

157
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,644
从康宁路的贺得逊先生那
From Mr. Hudson of Kennington Road.

158
00:17:13,628 --> 00:17:16,025
那座半身像怎么样了
Do we know what became of it?

159
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:17,903
门口的警官说
The officer at the door

160
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,374
在堪姆顿街
tells me it's been found

161
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,028
一所空房子的前院里
in the front garden

162
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,967
找到了半身像
of an empty house on Campden House Road.

163
00:17:22,712 --> 00:17:25,006
我正要去看看 你来吗
I was just going round to see it. Will you come?

164
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,512
我们现在就去 雷斯垂德
In a moment, Lestrade.

165
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,833
凶手要不就是腿长
Well the intruder either had very long legs

166
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:38,678
要不就是动作灵活
or was a most active man.

167
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:41,187
根据下面的地势 要想爬到壁架
With that area beneath it was no mean feat

168
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,577
可不是容易的事
to climb up to this ledge,

169
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:46,403
更别提打开窗户了
let alone to open the window.

170
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,088
哈克先生 你能和我们一起
Mr. Harker, will you come with us

171
00:18:00,161 --> 00:18:02,522
去看看半身像的碎片么
to see the remains of your bust?

172
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:04,958
我必须尽力将这事写下来
I must make something of it,

173
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:06,656
尽管我知道
although I have no doubt

174
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:08,006
今天伦敦
that every newspaper in London

175
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:08,817
发行的各大报纸
will be on the streets

176
00:18:08,818 --> 00:18:10,252
都会详细地报道此事
with a full and detailed account.

177
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,883
这就是我的命啊
Just my luck.

178
00:18:13,803 --> 00:18:15,606
你还记得顿卡斯特的
Do you remember when the stand fell down

179
00:18:15,683 --> 00:18:17,486
看台倒塌事件吗
at the Downcaster Races?

180
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,100
我是看台上唯一的记者
I was the only journalist in that stand,

181
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:21,796
而我的报纸是唯一一家
and my journal was the only one

182
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,574
没有刊登此事的报纸
that didn't have a published account

183
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:27,129
因为我受的震动太大了 写不出来
because I was too shaken to write a word.

184
00:18:27,202 --> 00:18:29,255
现在写发生在我家门口的谋杀案
Now I should be too late

185
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:32,350
可能是晚了些
with a murder on my own doorstep.

186
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:07,431
好了
Well?

187
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:08,963
我们有很多事要做
We have a long way to go

188
00:19:09,036 --> 00:19:10,732
不过已经掌握了一件事
but there is one suggestive fact.

189
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:12,858
这个人没有在屋内
He didn't smash this in the house

190
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,558
或者屋子附近立刻打碎半身像
or immediately outside it.

191
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,624
也许他当时遇到这个年轻人
Well perhaps he was so rattled and bustled

192
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,414
便慌乱起来
by meeting this other fellow

193
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:23,156
不知道该怎么做了
that he hardly knew what he was doing.

194
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:24,516
这也很有可能
That's likely enough.

195
00:19:24,593 --> 00:19:26,218
但是为什么他要在
But why did he choose to destroy it

196
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,004
这栋特殊的房子外打碎呢
outside this particular house?

197
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:33,426
这是座空房子
It's empty,

198
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,315
所以他知道没人来打扰他
so he knew he wouldn't be disturbed.

199
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:37,852
没错 但是街道那边
Yes, but there's another empty house

200
00:19:37,924 --> 00:19:38,607
还有一栋空房子
further up the street

201
00:19:38,608 --> 00:19:40,664
他一定得先经过那栋
he must have passed.

202
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:42,296
为什么他不在那打碎呢
Why not destroy it there?

203
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:49,265
路灯
The lamp.

204
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,701
啊 你终于答对了
By Jove, you're right.

205
00:19:54,316 --> 00:19:56,333
现在怎么办
What are we to make of that?

206
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,477
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

207
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:03,394
记住它
Remember it.

208
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,307
写在备案录里
Docket it.

209
00:20:05,383 --> 00:20:06,806
我们稍后在讨论
We may come on something later,

210
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,054
这个发现很有用
which will bear upon it.

211
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:09,555
与此同时 在我们各自调查之前
Meanwhile, before we go our separate ways

212
00:20:09,629 --> 00:20:12,411
我建议我们先去一个地方
I suggest we make one last concerted visit.

213
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:14,230
去哪?      停尸房
Where to?        The morgue.

214
00:21:07,821 --> 00:21:10,360
到现在也没能查出他的身份
They made nothing of his identity up to now.

215
00:21:10,431 --> 00:21:11,924
衣服很破
He was poorly dressed

216
00:21:11,998 --> 00:21:13,622
但他并不像个劳工
but doesn't seem to have been a laborer.

217
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:14,774
谁对这家伙
Whoever's responsible

218
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,822
干出割喉这么残忍的事呢
did a nasty job on the fellow's throat.

219
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:17,646
杀死他的凶器
Oh that was the murder weapon,

220
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:19,348
是一把锯齿小刀
had a serrated blade.

221
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,231
但我们还不知道凶器是属于嫌犯的
But whether it belonged to the murderer

222
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,019
还是死者的
or the dead man we don't yet know.

223
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:25,460
他身上有能证明他身份的东西么
Anything in his pockets to help identify him?

224
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:26,888
几乎没有
Precious little.

225
00:21:29,435 --> 00:21:32,769
福尔摩斯先生 您在听吗
If it might interest you, Mr. Holmes.

226
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:34,233
不好意思 雷斯垂德
Forgive me, Lestrade,

227
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:36,975
我只是在思考一些问题
I was just contemplating

228
00:21:37,055 --> 00:21:40,947
一个我还没解决的谜团
the one mystery that not even I can solve.

229
00:21:41,024 --> 00:21:42,412
死亡原因
Death itself.

230
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:44,145
请继续吧
Pray continue.

231
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:46,098
正如你看到的 他身上没什么东西
As you can see he carried very little.

232
00:21:46,175 --> 00:21:47,704
一个苹果 一些绳子
An apple, some string,

233
00:21:47,776 --> 00:21:49,685
伦敦地图
map of London

234
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,579
还有张照片
and a photograph.

235
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:56,505
照片被撕掉了一半
Well on part one it's torn.

236
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:58,040
瞧瞧
Look.

237
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,006
长相古怪的恶棍样
Odd looking devil.

238
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,687
跟猿猴似的
Positively simian.

239
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,165
下一步打算怎么办 雷斯垂德
What steps do you propose next, Lestrade?

240
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,042
依我所见 弄清内幕的最好办法是
Well the most practical way of getting at it,

241
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,302
先弄清死者的身份
in my opinion, is to identify the dead man.

242
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:13,936
一旦我们知道了他的身份
Once we know who he is

243
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,135
以及和他有关的人
and who his associates are,

244
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,982
我们便有个好的开端
we should have a good start in learning

245
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:18,489
帮我们弄清谁在贺拉斯・哈克先生家的
who killed him on the doorstep

246
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,071
台阶上杀了他
of Mr. Horace Harker.

247
00:22:21,151 --> 00:22:23,441
你看是这样吗 福尔摩斯先生
Don't you think so, Mr. Holmes?

248
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:24,433
当然
No doubt.

249
00:22:24,435 --> 00:22:27,032
不过这不是我处理此案的方式
It is not the way that I would conduct the case.

250
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:28,598
那你打算怎么做
And what would you do?

251
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:31,481
不要受我的影响 雷斯垂德
Oh, don't let me influence you, Lestrade.

252
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,539
我建议你按照你的办案方法
I suggest that you follow your line of inquiry

253
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,272
我按我的
and I mine.

254
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:37,462
这样我们可以交换
And we can compare notes,

255
00:22:37,545 --> 00:22:39,074
彼此的线索和意见
and each supplement the other.

256
00:22:39,146 --> 00:22:41,293
如果你要回彼特街
But if you are returning to Pitt Street,

257
00:22:41,373 --> 00:22:44,742
请告诉哈克先生
I would be grateful if you would tell Mr. Harker

258
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:51,036
我可以肯定
that I have quite made up my mind,

259
00:22:51,118 --> 00:22:54,214
一件事
in this matter.

260
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:55,525
昨晚来他家的
And so there was a

261
00:22:55,526 --> 00:22:58,800
是一个危险的杀人狂
dangerous and homicidal lunatic

262
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,646
并且对拿破仑
with Napoleonic delusions

263
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:04,614
有着很深的仇视
at his house last night.

264
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,315
这对他的报道有很大帮助
It will help him in his article.

265
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:08,164
你并不这么认为 对吗 福尔摩斯先生
You don't seriously believe that, Holmes?

266
00:23:08,242 --> 00:23:09,630
不是吗?
Don't I?

267
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:11,162
也许我不这样认为
Well, perhaps not.

268
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:18,154
但我肯定这会使贺拉斯・哈克先生
I 'm sure it will please Mr. Horace Harker

269
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:23,439
和中央情报辛迪加的订户们感兴趣
and the subscribers to the Central Press Agency.

270
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:25,181
雷斯垂德 我希望
I would be grateful, Lestrade,

271
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,452
如果你方便的话
if you could make it convenient

272
00:23:26,453 --> 00:23:28,662
今晚六点来贝克街
to come around to Baker Street

273
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:31,660
和我们见面
at six o'clock this evening.

274
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,157
在那之前
And until then

275
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,510
我想借用一下
I would like to keep this photograph

276
00:23:34,587 --> 00:23:35,903
这张在死者口袋中的照片
found in the dead man's pocket.

277
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,747
福尔摩斯先生 这可是个重要线索
Oh, Mr. Holmes that might be a vital clue.

278
00:23:37,823 --> 00:23:42,131
当然了 不然我也不会对它感兴趣了
I trust it is, otherwise it's of no interest to me.

279
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,391
祝你好运 雷斯垂德
Good luck, Lestrade.

280
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:04,124
我真不明白 我们干吗要纳税
What we pay our taxes for, I don't know.

281
00:24:04,206 --> 00:24:06,258
既然强盗都可以
When any ruffian can walk in

282
00:24:06,329 --> 00:24:07,681
在我们眼皮底下
and break one's goods,

283
00:24:07,756 --> 00:24:10,603
打碎东西
under one's nose.

284
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:13,774
他同时也让高超的工艺付诸东流
A superb bit of craftsmanship it was too.

285
00:24:13,846 --> 00:24:16,967
偷走笛万制作的皇帝头像的
Taken from a marble copy of the Emperor's head

286
00:24:17,047 --> 00:24:18,779
复制品
by Dupr'e.

287
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,482
请问您认识那位
Are you familiar,by chance,

288
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:22,509
伟大的艺术家吗?
with that great artists.

289
00:24:22,581 --> 00:24:24,069
当然认识 说到这
Yes indeed. Speaking in familiarly,

290
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:27,067
您认识照片中的人吗?
do you recognize the man in this photograph?

291
00:24:27,141 --> 00:24:28,564
照片中的人?
Man in the photograph?

292
00:24:28,638 --> 00:24:31,070
我确实认识他 福尔摩斯先生
Yes indeed I do, Mr. Holmes.

293
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,804
他叫倍波
The names Beppo.

294
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:34,235
倍波?
Beppo?

295
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,448
是的 他是个意大利人
Yes he was a sort of,

296
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:37,675
干零活的
Italian piecework man,

297
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,867
他在这干过活
who made himself useful here in the shop.

298
00:24:39,949 --> 00:24:42,096
他会雕刻
Oh, he could carve a bit,

299
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,979
做框子 镀金
and frame, and guild.

300
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:46,451
十天前我雇了他
I took him on about ten days ago

301
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,222
他只在这干了一星期
but he only stayed a week

302
00:24:48,302 --> 00:24:50,449
然后就消失了
and then just disappeared.

303
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,234
他连工资都没拿
Didn't even collect his wages.

304
00:24:53,313 --> 00:24:54,937
也许他跟
Perhaps he was responsible

305
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:56,407
打碎半身像有关
for the breakages.

306
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,940
打碎半身像?
Responsible for the breakages?

307
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,645
打碎半身像 哈?
Huh, responsible for the breakages?

308
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:04,061
先生们 这一定是场国际阴谋
My dear sir, this is an international conspiracy.

309
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:06,047
肯定是无政府主义者策划的
The Nihilist plot.

310
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,173
我把他们叫做红色共和军
Red republications I call them.

311
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:09,418
没错
Yes.

312
00:25:09,497 --> 00:25:10,849
只有无政府主义者
No one but an Anarchist

313
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,663
才会打破雕像
would go about breaking statues.

314
00:25:13,743 --> 00:25:16,449
他们有打碎你卖出去的其他东西么
Did they break every one that you sold?

315
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:17,986
我卖的其他东西?
Break every one I sold?

316
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,374
很难说
No hardly that.

317
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,183
只有两个卖给本地的大夫
Just the two bought by a local doctor

318
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,956
和留在我店中的一个
and the one left here in my shop.

319
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:24,696
至于其他三个怎么样
If anything happened to the other three

320
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,949
我就不知道了
I know nothing of it.

321
00:25:26,028 --> 00:25:27,308
还有三个?
Three?

322
00:25:27,386 --> 00:25:28,845
就是说原先有六个?
So there was six to begin with?

323
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,376
没错 是六个
Six to begin with, yes, yes.

324
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:31,871
这批来了六个
A batch of six.

325
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,161
我专门从
I ordered them especially

326
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:35,526
盖尔得尔和斯捷班尼公司定购的
from Gelder & Company of Stepney.

327
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,790
他们的模型做得很棒
They do excellent molding work.

328
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,400
您知道那几位顾客的
Do you happen to know the names and addresses

329
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,417
名字和住址么
of the other customers?

330
00:25:42,491 --> 00:25:44,852
福尔摩斯先生 我的账目
My ledgers, Mr. Holmes,

331
00:25:44,926 --> 00:25:46,835
是很保密的
are confidential.

332
00:25:49,346 --> 00:25:52,609
贺得逊先生
Mr. Hudson,

333
00:25:52,688 --> 00:25:54,491
如果你的理论是正确的
if you're theory's correct,

334
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:57,663
我们是不是该对这些人的危险阴谋
ought we to warn these people of this...

335
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,724
发出警告呢
this most dangerous plot?

336
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:03,680
有谁能比歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
And who better to do that

337
00:26:03,756 --> 00:26:06,982
更适合做这事呢
than Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

338
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:08,936
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

339
00:26:09,011 --> 00:26:10,363
没错
Yes, quite right.

340
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:11,826
您说得对
Quite right, sir.

341
00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:13,916
国家松懈了
Yes, the country slumbers

342
00:26:13,987 --> 00:26:16,420
但我们仍然该警醒着
but we shall remain vigilant.

343
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,154
是吧?
Huh?

344
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:19,966
跟我来
Follow me, sir.

345
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:28,560
在这
Here we are.

346
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,072
齐兹威克区的卓兹雅・布朗先生
Mr. Josiah Brown of Chiswick

347
00:26:31,145 --> 00:26:33,292
和瑞丁区的珊德福特夫人
and Mrs. Sandeford of Reading.

348
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:35,391
夫人      是的
Mrs.?        Yes.

349
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:36,850
贺得逊先生?
Mr. Hudson?

350
00:26:36,923 --> 00:26:39,734
什么事
Huh?

351
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:41,960
您的两个半身像
Did your two busts differ in anyway

352
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,320
和其他四个有不同么
from the other four?

353
00:26:43,397 --> 00:26:44,891
和其他四个?
Differ from the other four?

354
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,944
不 它们是完全一样的
No, no they were all identical.

355
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:48,854
他们都经过很漂亮的装饰
They're all with a beautiful decoration,

356
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:51,293
是我特别要求的
which I ordered especially.

357
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:53,656
除了装饰
Apart from the decoration

358
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,262
这六座半身像
were your six busts

359
00:26:55,334 --> 00:26:56,757
和其他的都一样吗
the same as all the others?

360
00:26:56,831 --> 00:26:57,579
和其他的一样吗?
The same as all the others?

361
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,418
我想应该是吧
Well I suppose so.

362
00:26:59,998 --> 00:27:01,587
你们应该直接去
But you'd have to apply direct

363
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:03,199
盖尔得尔和斯捷班尼公司问问
to Gelder & Company to find that out.

364
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,799
亲自去
In person.

365
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:07,861
好建议
Excellent idea.

366
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,214
先生们
Gentlemen?

367
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,714
先生们
Gentlemen?

368
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,519
你们见到经理时
When you meet the manager

369
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:13,661
能否提醒他
would you be good enough

370
00:27:13,663 --> 00:27:16,212
小心这个阴谋
to warn him of the conspiracy?

371
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:19,383
红色共和军很有可能利用
With all the busts they have on the premises

372
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:23,760
那些半身像大干一番
the Red republicans could have field day.

373
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:29,677
通常我们卖的半身像都不经过加工的
Normally we sell the bust without decoration

374
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:31,451
但是贺得逊先生要求
but Mr. Hudson ordered

375
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,818
所有的制服都要上色
that the whole uniform be painted.

376
00:27:33,896 --> 00:27:35,449
这是个额外要求
It was extra detail

377
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:38,973
使雕塑看上去很特殊
and made it a very special statue.

378
00:27:39,048 --> 00:27:40,815
但是 在做模型时
In times of the construction, however,

379
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:42,516
我们没必要
there is no reason

380
00:27:42,598 --> 00:27:45,194
专门为贺得逊先生制作
why the six napoleons we sold to him

381
00:27:45,277 --> 00:27:48,124
六个不同于其他的雕塑
should be different from hundreds of others.

382
00:27:48,788 --> 00:27:52,408
你看 把两半模型拼在一起
You see the two molds are put together

383
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:55,080
再用石膏粘上
and filled with plaster

384
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:57,450
就是一个完整的半身像了
to make the complete bust.

385
00:27:57,528 --> 00:27:59,295
是实心的吗?
Are they solid?

386
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,106
实心?
Solid?

387
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,401
当然了
Yes of coarse

388
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,398
然后它们被放到一个特殊的屋子里风干
Then they are placed in a special room to dry

389
00:28:06,473 --> 00:28:08,940
最后储存起来
and afterwards stored.

390
00:28:09,014 --> 00:28:11,030
批发价是六先令
The wholesale price is six shillings

391
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:14,780
但可以卖到十二个先令以上
but we would get twelve or more.

392
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,283
我实在想不明白
I can think of no reason

393
00:28:16,357 --> 00:28:19,169
为什么有人要摧毁它们
that someone should wish to destroy them.

394
00:28:19,246 --> 00:28:22,236
甚至为了这些杀人
Or murder for them.

395
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:24,182
杀人?
Murder?

396
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:42,420
那么
So,

397
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:46,596
你们对模型的制作感兴趣
your interest in the molding process

398
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:48,747
是有原因的了
had ulterior motives.

399
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:52,091
我想知道您是否认识
Mendelstam, I wonder if you happen to recognize

400
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:54,316
照片中的人
the man in this photograph.

401
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,521
是的
Yes indeed.

402
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,366
非常了解
Very well.

403
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:03,572
我们公司一向名声很好
This has always been a respectable establishment

404
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:05,944
警察只来过这一次
and the only time we ever had the police in here

405
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:08,595
就是因为这个家伙
was over this fellow.

406
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,019
大概一年前
About a year ago

407
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,454
他在街上捅了一个意大利人
he knifed another Italian in the street

408
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:13,918
然后躲到这来
and ran in here

409
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:16,281
警察随后就到了
with the police on his heels.

410
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,090
他是不是叫倍波?
Was his name Beppo,by any chance?

411
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:21,123
没错 倍波
Beppo, yes!

412
00:29:21,195 --> 00:29:23,414
我从来不知道他姓什么
His second name,I never knew.

413
00:29:23,493 --> 00:29:25,153
我自认倒霉
Served me right

414
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:28,187
雇了这么个家伙
for employing a man with such a face.

415
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:30,242
不过他很会干活
But he was a good workman,

416
00:29:30,315 --> 00:29:31,939
是个不错的好手
one of the best.

417
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,443
您还记得
Do you happen to remember

418
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:36,257
他被捕的确切时间吗
exactly when he was arrested?

419
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:39,491
我查查工资单就知道了
I could check the pay list.

420
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,481
根据冒斯・贺得逊记录
According to Morse Hudson's records

421
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,050
您在去年6月3号
you sold him six Napoleon's

422
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:45,304
卖给了他六座半身像
on June the third,of last year.

423
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:46,879
让我查查
Now let me see.

424
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,098
没错
That is correct

425
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:52,369
倍波 最后一次领工资是
Now Beppo, last collected his wages

426
00:29:52,449 --> 00:29:54,073
去年的
on May the twentieth,

427
00:29:54,155 --> 00:29:55,779
5月20号
of that same year.

428
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,177
然后他一定是在
Then he must have been arrested

429
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,782
接下来的一周被捕了
sometime the following week.

430
00:29:58,854 --> 00:30:02,045
警察一定有详细的资料
Well no doubt the police have the exact details.

431
00:30:02,126 --> 00:30:04,902
那个年轻的意大利人没死
The young Italian survived so

432
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:07,648
所以 倍波只在监狱里待了一年
Beppo only went to prison for one year.

433
00:30:07,728 --> 00:30:09,637
他表弟也在这工作
We have a cousin of his work in here,

434
00:30:09,712 --> 00:30:11,621
也许您想问问他
perhaps you would wish to speak with him?

435
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:13,428
不
No.

436
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:15,309
我请求您一个字都别对他说
Not a word to the cousin, I beg of you.

437
00:30:15,385 --> 00:30:17,152
这事很重要
The matter is very important

438
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,415
我越深入这件案子
and the further I go with it

439
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:20,559
越感到它的严重性
the more important it seems.

440
00:30:20,641 --> 00:30:23,114
这样啊 我只是觉得也许他的表弟
And so yeah. I merely thought his cousin

441
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,411
知道倍波被释放的时间
might know when Beppo is to be released.

442
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:29,370
曼杰利什塔姆
Mendelstam,

443
00:30:29,446 --> 00:30:33,301
如果我的猜测正确的话
if my surmises are correct,

444
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,216
倍波已经被释放
our friend Beppo has been out of jail

445
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,183
至少有十一天了
for at least eleven days.

446
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,087
嘿 华生
Hey, hey, Watson.

447
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,778
哈克已经设下了圈套      什么意思
Harker has baited the traps.        What do you mean?

448
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,823
如果有人知道怎么利用报纸
The press is a very valuable institution

449
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,331
它就是个很有用的东西
if one knows how to use it.

450
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,385
看报啊
Read all about it.

451
00:31:07,208 --> 00:31:08,761
你太狡猾了 福尔摩斯
Very cunning, Holmes.

452
00:31:08,843 --> 00:31:10,824
谢谢啊 华生
Thank you, Watson.

453
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:47,893
雷斯垂德
Lestrade!

454
00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:49,872
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

455
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:50,978
华生大夫
Doctor.

456
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,729
请坐
Please sit down.

457
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,363
谢谢
Thank you.

458
00:31:58,404 --> 00:32:02,045
呃
Well uh,

459
00:32:02,127 --> 00:32:03,894
有进展吗 福尔摩斯先生
what luck, Mr. Holmes?

460
00:32:03,973 --> 00:32:06,749
我们今天太忙了
We've had a very busy day.

461
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,772
而且小有收获
Not entirely wasted.

462
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,434
我追查到了
I can trace each of the busts

463
00:32:10,515 --> 00:32:12,318
每个半身像的来源
now from the beginning.

464
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:13,568
半身像
The busts!

465
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:15,178
你有你的方法
Well of course you have your own methods,

466
00:32:15,248 --> 00:32:16,980
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

467
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:18,683
我不会反对
Not for me to say a word against them

468
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:22,442
但我想我这一天的收获比你大
but I think I 've done a better days work than you.

469
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,884
我弄清了死者的身份
I 've identified the dead man.

470
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:25,990
好极了
Splendid!

471
00:32:26,073 --> 00:32:27,318
他是谁
Who is it?

472
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:28,817
彼埃拙・万努齐
Pietro Venucci,

473
00:32:28,891 --> 00:32:30,836
一个意大利零售商的儿子
son of a respectable Italian tradesman

474
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,864
和一个秘密政党有联系
that involved with a secret political society.

475
00:32:33,938 --> 00:32:35,467
红色无政府组织?
Red Anarchist?

476
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:37,342
你们一定见过冒斯・贺得逊先生了吧?
Oh you've been talking to Morse Hudson haven't you?

477
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,671
继续说 雷斯垂德
Do go on, Lestrade.

478
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:42,456
我刚说过 黑手党
I refer, of course,to the Mafia,

479
00:32:42,535 --> 00:32:43,887
你应该听说过
which, as you may know,

480
00:32:43,961 --> 00:32:47,223
通过暗杀来实现他们的信条
enforces its decrees by assassination.

481
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,691
显然 我们的凶手
Obviously our murderer

482
00:32:48,764 --> 00:32:50,224
违反了某方面的纪律
broke the rules in some fashion

483
00:32:50,296 --> 00:32:51,790
彼埃拙在跟踪他
and Pietro is put on his track.

484
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:53,594
很可能带着那张照片
Possibly with that photograph

485
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,580
是为了确认目标
to aid identification.

486
00:32:55,655 --> 00:32:57,245
他们碰面了
They meet

487
00:32:57,327 --> 00:32:59,379
在打斗中 彼埃拙
but Pietro receives his own death wound

488
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:01,810
受了致命伤
in the scuffle.

489
00:33:04,078 --> 00:33:07,104
很精彩 雷斯垂德 可我还是不明白
Excellent, Lestrade, but I don't quite follow

490
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,679
你对打破半身像的解释
your explanation of the destruction of the busts.

491
00:33:09,751 --> 00:33:12,112
我说福尔摩斯 半身像
Dear Holmes, the busts!

492
00:33:12,187 --> 00:33:14,062
你怎么老是忘不了半身像呢
You can never get those busts out of your head.

493
00:33:14,136 --> 00:33:15,560
半身像算不了什么
The busts are nothing.

494
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:17,329
小偷小摸 最多关六个月
Petty larceny, six months at most.

495
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:18,545
不 不 不
No, no, no.

496
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,951
我们调查的是凶杀
It's murder we're really investigating,

497
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:22,900
老实说吧
and I tell you

498
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:26,761
我已经掌握了所有线索
I 'm gathering all the threads into my hand.

499
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,192
那下一步呢
And the next stage?

500
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:29,761
很好
Awe, well now.

501
00:33:29,832 --> 00:33:31,979
我们有个侦探
We have an inspector who's made a specialty

502
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,970
专门负责意大利区
out of the Italian quarter.

503
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,289
我和他去意大利区
I shall go down there with him,

504
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,549
找照片上的人
find the man in that photograph you're carrying,

505
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:41,069
然后以谋杀罪逮捕他
arrest him for murder.

506
00:33:41,143 --> 00:33:43,955
你呢 福尔摩斯先生
What you say, Mr. Holmes?

507
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:45,942
和我们一起去么
Will you come with us?

508
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:47,748
我不想去
I think not.

509
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:50,259
我想很可能会在
I fancy Chiswick as the address

510
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:52,206
齐兹威克区找到他
most likely to find him.

511
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,561
齐兹威克区?
Chiswick?

512
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:55,097
如果你和你的人愿意
If you and some of your men

513
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:56,829
今晚和我们一起去齐兹威克区
will come with us to Chiswick tonight,

514
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,093
那我明天就和你一起去意大利区
I will go to the Italian quarter with you tomorrow

515
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,746
耽误一天不会有事的
and there will be no harm in the delay.

516
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:04,284
你和我们一起吃晚饭
I suggest you dine with us

517
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:06,789
然后在沙发上休息
and then you're welcome to the sofa.

518
00:34:06,864 --> 00:34:09,082
睡上一小觉对我们有好处
A few hours sleep will do us all good.

519
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:11,758
大概十一点出门
I don't intend to leave the house before eleven.

520
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,465
我们很可能得到天亮
It is unlikely that we shall

521
00:34:13,546 --> 00:34:15,041
才能回来
be home before morning.

522
00:34:15,112 --> 00:34:16,915
但是福尔摩斯先生
But Mr. Holmes...

523
00:34:16,992 --> 00:34:19,565
与此同时
In the meantime,

524
00:34:19,636 --> 00:34:22,661
我有封信需要通讯员送一下
I have a letter to send by Express Messenger.

525
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:24,323
贺得逊夫人?
Mrs. Hudson?

526
00:34:24,405 --> 00:34:26,314
贺得逊夫人?
Mrs. Hudson?

527
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,198
齐兹威克区
Chiswick?

528
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:07,244
(意大利语)

529
00:35:26,111 --> 00:35:27,985
爸爸
Pa Pa!

530
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:13,578
十一点了
Eleven o'clock.

531
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:16,120
先生们起来了
Gentlemen on your feet.

532
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,519
该出发了 雷斯垂德
Come along Lestrade.

533
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:19,514
华生 我想
Watson, I think you've been

534
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:21,751
你们葡萄酒喝得有点多
overgenerous with the port.

535
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:23,527
您对您的消息就够吝啬了
You've been frugal enough with your information.

536
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:25,552
我们坐四轮马车
Awe that will be our four-wheeler.

537
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:27,085
别忘了带我的手枪 华生
Don't forget the revolver, Watson,

538
00:36:27,157 --> 00:36:28,132
还有小毯子
and bring the rugs.

539
00:36:28,135 --> 00:36:30,187
这次行动不会是
This outing wouldn't be

540
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,925
受"偏执的意念"的启发吧 是吗?
inspired by your'idee fix, ' would it?

541
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,330
"偏执的意念"      对
' Ide fixe. '        Yes.

542
00:36:35,332 --> 00:36:36,587
石膏半身像
The plaster bust.

543
00:36:36,589 --> 00:36:38,466
我有很大把握 雷斯垂德
I have great hopes, Lestrade.

544
00:36:38,537 --> 00:36:40,313
事实上 我有三分之二的把握
In fact, I bet it's exactly two-to-one

545
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:41,141
要是你今晚跟我们一起去
that if you come with us tonight

546
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:42,991
天亮之前
you'll have the murderer in custody

547
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,796
你就能抓到凶手
before the sun rises.

548
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,948
我从不打赌 福尔摩斯先生
I 'm not a betting man, Mr. Holmes.

549
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,319
那你也就没什么可输的了
Then you have nothing to lose by it do you?

550
00:36:51,798 --> 00:36:53,814
除了一个好觉而已
Except a good nights sleep.

551
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,679
华生 你要是感冒就是自找的了
Watson, if you've caught a cold it's your fault.

552
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:27,331
谁让你把毯子落下了
You left the rugs behind.

553
00:37:27,402 --> 00:37:29,691
不好意思 福尔摩斯
Sorry, Holmes.

554
00:37:35,405 --> 00:37:37,481
两点了吗?
Is that two o'clock?

555
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,528
不能抽烟 是吧?
I don't suppose we can smoke, can we?

556
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,476
不能      想想而已
Nope.        Thought as much.

557
00:37:59,664 --> 00:38:01,124
你的人都到位了么
Are your men in position?

558
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,104
是的
Oh yes.

559
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,320
来点薄荷糖 雷斯垂德
Have a humbug, Lestrade.

560
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:13,375
华生
Watson,

561
00:38:13,447 --> 00:38:16,508
我们可没时间吃糖
this is no time for humbugs.

562
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:20,337
快看
Look!

563
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:51,136
那就是你等的人?
Is that who you expected?

564
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:52,868
他叫倍波
His name's Beppo.

565
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:55,487
这名字很适合猴子
Good name for a monkey.

566
00:38:57,822 --> 00:39:00,776
他会从后门逃走
He'll leave by the back door.

567
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:02,201
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

568
00:39:02,276 --> 00:39:04,186
因为其他门都锁上了
Cause all the other doors are locked.

569
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:09,965
天哪 都碎了
Oh dear, it's smashed.

570
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:12,056
我想您就是卓兹雅・布朗
Mr. Josiah Brown, I presume?

571
00:40:12,127 --> 00:40:13,266
是我 先生
Yes sir.

572
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,634
不用说 您一定是歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生
And you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

573
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:18,451
我收到了您让邮差送来的信
I had the note you sent by the express messenger

574
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,819
我完全按照您的吩咐做了
and I did exactly as you told me.

575
00:40:20,897 --> 00:40:22,426
按照您的指示
Following your instructions,

576
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,231
我们把门都锁上了
we locked every door

577
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,253
好把他引到后门来
so as to lead him into the back.

578
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:29,660
很高兴您抓到了这个恶棍
And I 'm very glad to see you have the rascal.

579
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:31,434
先生们 我希望
Now I hope, gentlemen,

580
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,042
你们能进屋坐坐
you will come and partake

581
00:40:33,114 --> 00:40:34,466
吃些点心
in some refreshment.

582
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:36,415
谢谢 布朗先生
Thank you, Mr. Brown.

583
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,671
不过时间不早了
The hour is rather late.

584
00:40:38,751 --> 00:40:40,104
晚安
Good night.

585
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:41,673
晚安
Oh good night.

586
00:40:41,745 --> 00:40:43,168
走了 华生 我们还有别的事做
Come, Watson, we have work to do.

587
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:44,415
别的事?
Work?

588
00:40:44,494 --> 00:40:45,882
什么事?
What work?

589
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:48,555
雷斯垂德 如果你今晚六点
Lestrade, if you will come around to Baker Street

590
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:51,269
来贝克街的话
tonight at six o'clock.

591
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:52,774
我会给你说明
I hope to be able to show you

592
00:40:52,847 --> 00:40:54,341
直到现在你还没有完全了解的
that you still have not grasped

593
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:56,038
这个案件的意义
the full meaning of this business.

594
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,988
我想你会发现我的黑手党理论
Oh, I think you'll find my theory of the Mafia

595
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,771
是正确的 福尔摩斯先生
will work out all right, Mr. Holmes.

596
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:04,150
晚安 雷斯垂德
Good night, Lestrade.

597
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:06,136
走了
Come along now.

598
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:12,542
到贝克街
Baker Street please.

599
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:20,167
现在 华生 我要告诉你一个
And now, Watson,I commend to you

600
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:23,607
适合所有问题的答案
the universal answer to almost all the problems.

601
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:26,044
是什么 福尔摩斯?
What's that, Holmes?

602
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,851
睡觉
Sleep.

603
00:41:41,327 --> 00:41:43,439
(意大利语)

604
00:41:51,526 --> 00:41:53,993
(意大利语)

605
00:41:57,546 --> 00:42:00,465
(意大利语)

606
00:42:05,553 --> 00:42:07,461
早上好 华生
Morning Watson.

607
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,361
由于倍波的首次被捕
And since the manager of Gelder & Company

608
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:15,668
和盖尔得尔公司的经理有很大关系
was mainly responsible for Beppo's initial arrest,

609
00:42:15,749 --> 00:42:17,409
所以我们认为他为了报复
we see the breaking of the busts

610
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:20,585
才打碎了那些半身像
as a pathetic attempt to revenge himself.

611
00:42:20,657 --> 00:42:22,045
不过很可能
And it was possibly

612
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:23,613
是无意的暴力行为
the senseless acts of violence,

613
00:42:23,685 --> 00:42:26,532
也许是违反了黑手党的规矩
which transgressed the Mafia's code of behavior

614
00:42:26,608 --> 00:42:31,294
才导致了万努齐的死
and lead to the murder of young Venucci.

615
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:34,224
这里 我想到了昨晚你提到的
There, I think that takes care

616
00:42:34,299 --> 00:42:37,253
那些细节
of those details you mentioned last night.

617
00:42:37,327 --> 00:42:41,777
是吗 福尔摩斯先生
Don't you, Mr. Holmes?

618
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:43,797
福尔摩斯
Holmes!

619
00:42:46,237 --> 00:42:48,254
怎么了 华生
Yes Watson.

620
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,825
你怎么看雷斯垂德的推测
Well what do you think of Lestrade's theories?

621
00:42:50,827 --> 00:42:52,546
我相信那一定很有意思
I 'm sure that they are of the greatest interest

622
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:53,369
但是很抱歉
but I regret to say

623
00:42:53,371 --> 00:42:54,266
我一个字都没听进去
I 've not listened to a word of them.

624
00:42:54,268 --> 00:42:56,039
原谅我的走神 雷斯垂德
Forgive my inattention Lestrade,

625
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,410
我昨晚睡得太晚了
I had a rather late night.

626
00:42:57,412 --> 00:43:00,643
你以为我睡得好吗
Look, what do you think I had?

627
00:43:05,692 --> 00:43:07,317
请进
Come in.

628
00:43:10,495 --> 00:43:14,173
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生在这吗
Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?

629
00:43:15,995 --> 00:43:18,771
啊
Ah,

630
00:43:18,848 --> 00:43:20,508
恐怕我迟到了
I fear I am a little late

631
00:43:20,588 --> 00:43:22,212
不过火车实在是太慢了
but the trains were very awkward.

632
00:43:22,293 --> 00:43:24,096
没关系
No matter, no matter.

633
00:43:24,173 --> 00:43:27,329
您把东西带来么
Have you brought the item?

634
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,963
他们是我朋友和同事
Oh these are my friends and colleagues,

635
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:31,239
华生大夫和苏格兰场的雷斯垂德探长
Doctor Watson and Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.

636
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,419
您放心地说吧
You may speak freely in front of them.

637
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,206
先生们 您在电报中说
Gentlemen, you said in your telegram

638
00:43:36,284 --> 00:43:38,680
贺得逊先生告诉了您我的地址
that Mr. Hudson had given you my address.

639
00:43:38,755 --> 00:43:40,379
瑞丁区的珊德福特先生
Mr. Sandeford, of Reading.

640
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,635
是我 先生
The same, sir.

641
00:43:41,714 --> 00:43:42,995
您好吗
How do you do?

642
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:44,388
又是那些半身像
It's those busts again.

643
00:43:44,464 --> 00:43:46,302
说得对 雷斯垂德
Correct, Lestrade.

644
00:43:46,378 --> 00:43:47,694
他有告诉您
Did he also tell you

645
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:49,643
我妻子花了多少钱买的吗
just how much my wife paid for it?

646
00:43:49,718 --> 00:43:51,308
他并没说
No he did not.

647
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,537
先生 我并不富有
Well sir, I am an honest man

648
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:55,005
可我是个老实人
and not a very rich one

649
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:56,572
她只花了十五个先令
and she only gave fifteen shillings for it

650
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:58,589
在我拿走您电报中
and I think you ought to know that

651
00:43:58,664 --> 00:44:00,431
提到的十英镑前
before I take the ten pounds from you

652
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:02,038
您有必要知道这点
that you offered in your telegraph.

653
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:04,089
您的顾虑说明您很诚实
Oh your scruple does you much honor,

654
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:05,585
珊德福特先生 既然我已经开价了
Mr. Sandeford but I have stated my price

655
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,118
我就要坚持这么做
and I shall stick to it.

656
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:08,846
谢谢您 福尔摩斯先生 您太慷慨了
Oh thank you, Mr. Holmes, that's very handsome of you.

657
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:10,280
给您半身像
You're bust sir.

658
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,955
我妻子总是觉得
You know my wife has always maintained

659
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:15,358
我和这位君主
there is a marked resemblance between

660
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,866
有着显著的相同之处
myself and the Emperor.

661
00:44:17,943 --> 00:44:21,099
我自己没看出来
I can't say I see it myself.

662
00:44:29,186 --> 00:44:31,060
第六座拿破仑
Sixth Napoleon.

663
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,663
今早我用电报
I contacted Mrs. Sandeford

664
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:34,788
联系了珊德福特夫人
by telegram this morning.

665
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,185
现在
Now,

666
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:38,885
请您当着见证人的面
if you will sign this paper

667
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:40,947
在这张纸上签字
in front of witnesses,

668
00:44:41,018 --> 00:44:42,221
这只是表明
it is simply to say

669
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,008
您将与这座半身像有关的一切权利
that you transferred every possible rights

670
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:45,985
都转让给我
that you would ever have in the bust to me.

671
00:44:46,066 --> 00:44:48,355
乐意之极 福尔摩斯先生
Happy to, Mr. Holmes, happy, happy, happy.

672
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:50,834
我是个循规蹈矩的人
I am a methodical man and one never knows

673
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:52,632
一个人无法预测将来会出什么事
what turn of events my take afterwards.

674
00:44:52,713 --> 00:44:54,410
这是您的十英镑 先生
Here is your ten-pound note sir.

675
00:44:54,488 --> 00:44:56,255
晚安 珊德福特先生
Good evening, Mr. Sandeford.

676
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,385
非常感谢 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you very much, Mr. Holmes.

677
00:44:58,455 --> 00:45:00,602
晚安 先生们
It's good evening, gentlemen.

678
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:03,009
您真是太好了
And it's very, very kind of you

679
00:45:03,085 --> 00:45:05,932
非常感谢 您的价格太让我满意了 我...
Thank you so much, and I'm very pleased of that. Oh my...

680
00:45:54,246 --> 00:45:55,669
先生们
Now gentlemen,

681
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:58,068
注意啦
if you will give me your undivided attention.

682
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,131
允许我向你们介绍
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to one of

683
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:15,325
世界上最珍贵的东西
the most precious objects in the world.

684
00:46:18,191 --> 00:46:22,189
著名的包格斯黑珍珠
The famous black pearl of Borgias!

685
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:26,856
太妙了 福尔摩斯
Bravo, Holmes, bravo!

686
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:31,271
你太神奇了
Oh you're a legend to man.

687
00:46:31,347 --> 00:46:33,708
真是堪比魔术大师马斯基林
Rival that of Maskelyne himself

688
00:46:33,782 --> 00:46:35,763
这岂止是魔术师能比的
This surpasses it.

689
00:46:35,837 --> 00:46:37,389
自从这颗包格斯珍珠
The Borgias pearl's been missing

690
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:38,931
在科隆那王子在
since it disappeared

691
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:40,556
达柯尔旅馆的卧室丢失后
from the Prince of Colonna's bedroom

692
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,335
已经消失很久了
in that Dacre Hotel,

693
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:45,510
大概有一年了吧
over a year ago.

694
00:46:45,582 --> 00:46:47,420
你可能还记得 雷斯垂德
As you may remember, Lestrade,

695
00:46:47,496 --> 00:46:50,936
警察曾经向我请教过这案子
I was consulted upon the case at the time.

696
00:46:54,595 --> 00:47:00,433
我一直在观察比较
Observe and learn.

697
00:47:00,511 --> 00:47:02,207
当万努齐的名字
The moment the name Venucci

698
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:03,640
第一次出现在此案中时
surfaced to this case

699
00:47:03,714 --> 00:47:06,252
立刻激起了我的兴趣
I immediately became intrigued.

700
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:09,171
一段时间内 科隆那王妃的女仆
The Princess of Colonna's maid, for some time,

701
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:12,095
芮什雅・万努齐
had been one,Lucrezia Venucci.

702
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,223
曾是被怀疑的对象
Suspicion fell on her

703
00:47:14,294 --> 00:47:16,476
事实证明她有个兄弟在伦敦
and it was proved that she had a brother in London

704
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:18,015
但是我们并没有弄清
but we failed to trace

705
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:19,476
他们之间有无联系
any connection between them.

706
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:22,017
但倍波和她有联系
Beppo was the connection.

707
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:27,026
他追求过芮什雅・万努齐
He had been courting Lucrezia Venucci

708
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,010
一段时间
for some time.

709
00:47:29,086 --> 00:47:31,375
你怎么想到这点的
Where did you get that.

710
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,634
彼埃拙・万努齐
Pietro Venucci.

711
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:35,137
我明白了
Oh, I see.

712
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:36,600
当万努齐一家
When the Venucci family

713
00:47:36,672 --> 00:47:39,864
计划偷黑珍珠时
planned to steal the black pearl,

714
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,604
他们利用倍波作为
they used Beppo as a go between

715
00:47:41,685 --> 00:47:43,417
芮尔雅和她哥哥的联络人
for Lucrezia and her brother.

716
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:45,333
倍波收集到足够的信息
Beppo gleaned enough information

717
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:47,141
于是他独自偷了珍珠
to execute the robber himself

718
00:47:47,218 --> 00:47:49,092
并且携赃逃跑
and make off with the pearl.

719
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:50,721
彼埃拙・万努齐
Pietro Venucci,the brother,

720
00:47:50,803 --> 00:47:53,056
在盖尔得尔店外抓到了他
caught up with him outside Gelder's workshop,

721
00:47:53,134 --> 00:47:55,151
倍波刺伤了他
Beppo stabbed him,

722
00:47:55,222 --> 00:47:57,655
然后逃到了仓库
he then fled into the warehouse

723
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:00,232
躲在风干室
and took refuge in the drying room.

724
00:48:00,304 --> 00:48:02,036
他知道他只有几分钟的时间了
He knew he only had moments

725
00:48:02,114 --> 00:48:03,503
他得把珍珠藏起来
in which to conceal the pearl,

726
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:04,964
否则搜身时
which would otherwise be found on him

727
00:48:05,038 --> 00:48:06,627
就会被发现了
when he was searched.

728
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,519
当时所有风干的雕塑中
Among all the plaster casts drying that day,

729
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:11,958
有他做的一批六个
he made for the batch of six

730
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:14,845
是为冒斯・贺得逊特别做的
that had been ear marked for Morse Hudson

731
00:48:14,922 --> 00:48:16,998
在这几个当中
and the base of one of them

732
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,333
有一个还是软的
was still soft.

733
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,407
这是个绝好的藏珠之地
It was an admirable hiding place.

734
00:48:32,045 --> 00:48:35,236
倍波一出狱
As soon as Beppo got out of prison

735
00:48:35,317 --> 00:48:36,846
他设法让冒斯・贺得逊
he managed to find employment

736
00:48:36,918 --> 00:48:38,614
雇佣他
with Mr. Morse Hudson

737
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:40,116
并且对六座拿破仑半身像
and set about tracking

738
00:48:40,189 --> 00:48:41,742
展开追踪
the six Napoleons down.

739
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:44,707
他找到并打碎了其中三个
He found and destroyed three of them

740
00:48:44,783 --> 00:48:47,880
但是那晚他到哈克家时
but the night he located Harker's,

741
00:48:47,951 --> 00:48:51,427
彼埃拙・万努齐决定要报复
Pietro Venucci,intent on vengeance,

742
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,169
在和他说话时
accosted him and this time

743
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,026
倍波割断了他的喉咙
Beppo slit his throat.

744
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,121
只剩下两个半身像了
With only two busts left

745
00:48:59,192 --> 00:49:00,580
他很可能会
it was likely he would

746
00:49:00,654 --> 00:49:02,042
先找伦敦这个
try the London one first.

747
00:49:02,115 --> 00:49:03,324
因此我们去了齐兹威克区
Hence our visit to Chiswick.

748
00:49:03,403 --> 00:49:05,278
说得没错 华生
Exactly, Watson.

749
00:49:05,352 --> 00:49:08,342
只剩下在瑞丁区的半身像了
That left only the Reading bust.

750
00:49:08,415 --> 00:49:12,378
所以我当着你们的面把它买来
I bought it in your presence from the owner

751
00:49:12,453 --> 00:49:14,291
就在那
and there it lies.

752
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:21,494
福尔摩斯先生
Well, Mr. Holmes.

753
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:31,034
我见过您处理很多案件
I've seen you handle a good many cases in my time

754
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,089
但我不像
but I don't know that I ever knew

755
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:37,359
这件案子处理得那么巧妙
a more workman like one than this.

756
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,492
我们苏格兰场的人 你要知道
We're not jealous of you, you know,

757
00:49:39,564 --> 00:49:40,561
并不是嫉妒你
at Scotland Yard.

758
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:46,341
我们以您为骄傲
I will say we're proud of you.

759
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,973
如果您明天早上能来的话
And if you come down tomorrow

760
00:49:48,056 --> 00:49:49,892
我想所有人 无论老的
there's not a man from the oldest inspector

761
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:53,309
还是年轻的警察
to the youngest constable,

762
00:49:53,381 --> 00:49:55,041
都会很高兴
who wouldn't be glad

763
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,862
和您握手祝贺的
to shake you by the hand.

764
00:50:00,202 --> 00:50:01,862
谢谢
Thank you.

765
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,561
谢谢
Thank you.

766
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:17,078
你能把康克-辛格尔顿伪造案的
Would you get down the

767
00:50:17,152 --> 00:50:18,776
文件拿出来吗
Conk-Singleton forgery case,

768
00:50:18,857 --> 00:50:20,909
华生?
please Watson?

769
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:31,101
再见 雷斯垂德
Goodbye, Lestrade

770
00:50:31,178 --> 00:50:32,838
如果你遇到任何问题
and if any little problem comes your way

771
00:50:32,917 --> 00:50:34,110
我都将
I shall be happy, if I can,

772
00:50:34,112 --> 00:50:37,405
尽可能帮你解决的
to give you a hint or two as to its solution.

773
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,272
处死通告

774
00:51:38,527 --> 00:51:43,282
本席现在宣判对倍波・西柯里尼执行环首之刑
在本人的监督下择日施行

776
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:52,336
