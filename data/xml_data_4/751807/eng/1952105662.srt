1
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,190
Recording in one minute.
Studio stand by.

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,999
We'll talk about cuts

3
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,310
in government extravagance,
aren'twe?

4
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,712
We'll get to that if we've got
time afterthe National Data Base.

5
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,108
I don't think people are really
interested in the Data Base.

6
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,349
It's so trivial.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,520
VTrunning.

8
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,114
- What's the matter?
- You look a bit too pink.

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,192
We can't have that, whatwould
the Daily Telegraph say?

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,511
All those questions about
"are we creating a police state?"

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,274
- We can do without those.
- Jim, you knowme.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,476
I don't give out
my questions in advance.

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,278
Dead silence, please.

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,839
Ten seconds...

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,277
Five. Four. Three. Two...

16
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,675
Good evening.

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,832
Is Big Brotherwatching you?
To be more precise,

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,992
the Government is building up
a dossieron you.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,551
It's called by the harmless name
of"National Integrated Data Base".

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,479
At the press of a button
any civil servant

21
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,518
can inspect just about
every detail of your life

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,070
yourtax, yourmedical record,
periods of unemployment,

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,277
children's school records,
and that civil servant

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,396
may happen to be
yourneighbour.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,593
There's been mounting concern
overthis powerful,

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,513
even totalitarian weapon
that the computerrevolution

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,557
has put into
the Government's hand.

28
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,632
And the man who wields
the weapon is the Minister

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,588
forAdministrative Affairs,
the Right Honourable James Hacker.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,437
Now, Minister, are we laying
the foundations of a police state?

31
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,475
You know, I'm glad
you asked me that question.

32
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,310
Well, Minister,
could we have the answer?

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,719
Well, yes of course, I'm about
to give it to you, if I may.

34
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,709
As I said, I'm glad
you asked me that question.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Because...

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,394
it's a question

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,951
a lot of people are asking.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
And why?

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,996
Because a lot of people
want to know the answerto it.

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,154
And let's be quite clearabout this
without beating about the bush,

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,034
the plain fact of the matter is

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,796
that it's a very important
question indeed

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,316
and people have
a right to know.

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,192
But Minister, we haven't
yet had the answer.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,351
I'm sorry,
whatwas the question?

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,277
Now look, supposing
I annoy you in this interview,

47
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,829
how do I know
you won't go back to youroffice,

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,514
press a button
and call up my tax records,

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,353
my hospital records,
my police record...

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,635
Oh no. No. No.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,473
Bob, that's not the way
we do things in this country.

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,269
What's the Data Base for
if it's not to check up on people?

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,837
You know, that's
a very interesting question.

54
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,315
It's forstoring information

55
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,677
so as to speed up
government business

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,078
so thatwe need not take on
an enormous influx of clerical staff.

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,755
Computers are big business
and are good news.

58
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,072
But, Minister, if you put
information into the machine,

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,993
you'll eventually take information
out of the machine.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,958
Not necessarily.

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,718
So, you're going to spend
25 million pounds

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,871
accumulating information
and neveruse it?

63
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,597
No. Yes. No.

64
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,040
Well, there will be safeguards.

65
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,269
Such as?

66
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,595
Close in on him, Two.
Bob's got him on the run.

67
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,153
One minute 45, studio.

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,357
We'll be looking
at a whole range of possibilities.

69
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,230
And of course, it's a complex
and highly technical matter.

70
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,277
Rome wasn't built in a day.

71
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,794
It's underreview.

72
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,269
And of course,
these things take time.

73
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,876
Minister, am I talking
to the formereditorof Reform

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,792
orto a Civil Service spokesman?

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,713
We haven't talked about
the safeguards I've introduced.

76
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,077
And there's my newbureaucratic
watchdog office, for instance.

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,158
It does look as if we'll need

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,595
a whole pack of watchdogs
before long.

79
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,359
But thank you very much.

80
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,754
Right, hold it there
while we check the tape.

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,559
- How did it go?
- Well, I thought... First class.

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,314
- Very good indeed.
- I thought I waffled a bit.

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,392
Oh no, you stonewalled
superbly, Minister.

84
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,629
Time fora drink?

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,876
About the safeguards
I've introduced.

86
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,679
My newbureaucratic
watchdog office, for instance.

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,230
It sounds as if we'll need a pack
of watchdogs before very long.

88
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,799
But thank you very much.

89
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,994
In next week's topic...

90
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,833
- Howwas I?
- Splendid, Minister.

91
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,351
Very dignified. Very suitable.

92
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,590
Yes, Sir Humphrey,
I congratulate you.

93
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,751
Jim is nowperfectly
house trained.

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,638
He does exactly
what you tell him.

95
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,394
- If you'll excuse me, Mr. Weasel.
- Weisel.

96
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,631
You say everything the Civil Service
programmes you to say.

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,552
What are you a man ora mouth?

98
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,073
Very amusing, Frank.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,357
It might be hard fora Political
Advisorto understand this,

100
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,431
but I am merely a Civil Servant,

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,831
I simply do as I am instructed
by my master.

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,429
If the Minister's a woman
what do you call her?

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,432
Yes, that's rather interesting.

104
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,999
We sought an answer

105
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,755
when I was Principal Private Secretary
and Dr. Edith Summerskill,

106
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,912
as she then was,
was appointed Minister in 1947.

107
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,913
I didn't quite like to refer
to heras my Mistress.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,713
- Whatwas the answer?
- We're still waiting for it.

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,671
It's underreview, is it?
Rome wasn't built in a day.

110
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,070
- These things take time.
- I must be going.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,231
- Me too.
- May I remind you

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,516
we meet tomorrowmorning
at Paddington at 8?

113
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,955
- Where are we going?
- Swansea, Minister.

114
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,908
You're addressing the Conference
of Municipal Treasurers.

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,195
Oh, yes.

116
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,591
You're due in Newcastle
to address the by election meeting.

117
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,478
- So I am.
- You can't do both.

118
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,790
- I can't do both.
- That's a Civil Service junket.

119
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,474
- The by election's important.
- It's important.

120
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,076
The Conference is in yourdiary.
They expect you in Swansea.

121
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,071
They expects you in Newcastle.

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,834
- How come he's double booked?
- How come I'm double booked?

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,673
Well, largely because nobody
told me about Newcastle.

124
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,558
- Why didn't you tell him?
- Why didn't you?

125
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,278
I can't remembereverything.

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,311
Frank, I think
I'd bettergo to Swansea.

127
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,596
- Is that a decision?
- Yes, that's final.

128
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,318
The P. M. Expects you
to go to Newcastle.

129
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,674
The P. M?

130
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,155
I think I'd bettergo
to Newcastle, Bernard.

131
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,440
- Is that a decision, Jim?
- Yes, that's final.

132
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,431
- Now I'm going home.
- Is that a decision?

133
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,953
No, quite seriously...

134
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,475
I think you've made
the wrong decision.

135
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,949
Yourvisit to Swansea's
been announced.

136
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,350
- You can't get out of it.
- Oh, Lord!

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,751
Find a way of getting me
from Swansea to Newcastle.

138
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,151
Car, train, helicopter, anything.
I'll have to do both.

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,709
And now I'm going home,
and that is final!

140
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,996
- Finallyfinal?
- Absolutelyfinally.

141
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,034
If you could do
all yourboxes tonight.

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,034
There's all the M&A Committee
papers and all the letters.

143
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,316
And if you're a good boy,
you'll get a sweetie.

144
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Good.

145
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,154
Hello, darling.

146
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,118
- Thanks, George. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.

147
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,757
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

148
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,159
Leaving me at last?

149
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,595
It's ouranniversary tomorrow,
have you forgotten?

150
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,069
No, of course I haven't forgotten.

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,069
We're going to Paris.
Oh, my God!

152
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,753
- You had forgotten.
- No, I hadn't.

153
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,798
No, it's just that I...
I didn't... I'm double...

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,589
- I'm going to Swansea tomorrow.
- Swansea?

155
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,829
And Newcastle.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,991
I don'twant to go there
formy anniversary.

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,752
No. Not you. Just me.

158
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,876
- Cancel them!
- I can't.

159
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,553
What are you doing?

160
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,789
Cancel them! We booked this
three months ago.

161
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,952
- I can't.
- Then I'll go to Paris without you.

162
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,670
Hello, Bernard...
Yes, it's me...

163
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,956
I'm going to have
to cancel tomorrow.

164
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,035
Swansea and Newcastle.

165
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,588
It's my wife's wedding
anniversary tomorrow...

166
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,949
It's yours too!

167
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,237
Yeah, and mine too actually.
Yes, it is.

168
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,631
Coincidence?
Don't be silly.

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,793
Anyway, I'm going to Paris
tomorrow and that's final.

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,870
Yes, I said that before,
but this time is final!

171
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,520
You'll just have to cope
as best as you can.

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,669
Yes?

173
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,231
Yes... definitely...

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,319
Yes...

175
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,748
Is that clear?

176
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,435
Right!

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,393
We're going to Paris.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,069
No, I'm going to Swansea
and Newcastle.

179
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,194
- See me on TV tonight?
- I saw somebody who looked like you.

180
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,191
- What's that meant to mean?
- Nothing.

181
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,079
Frank says I've become
a Civil Service mouthpiece.

182
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,434
- Yes.
- What do you mean, yes?

183
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,431
- Well... yes.
- You mean you agree?

184
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,034
- Of course.
- What do you mean, of course?

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,510
You could have hired and actor
to say it all foryou.

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,148
And why not just sign
your letters with a rubberstamp?

187
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,709
Orget an Assistant Principal
to sign them foryou.

188
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,279
They write them anyway.

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,398
Assistant Principals
do notwrite my letters!

190
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,998
UnderSecretaries do that.

191
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,391
I rest my case, my lord.

192
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,710
- You think I've become a puppet?
- Yes, I do.

193
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,832
Get Miss Piggy to do yourjob.
She's prettier.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,592
I don't knowwhat to do.

195
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,910
I'm just swamped by the work.

196
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,397
Oh, Annie, I'm so depressed.

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,516
As we're not going to Paris,

198
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,428
let's at least go out
fora quiet little dinnertonight.

199
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,235
No, I can't.

200
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,914
Bernard's told me
to get through three boxes.

201
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,036
What do you mean,
Bernard's told you?

202
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,038
When you edited "Reform"
you were quite different.

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,475
You went in,
you told people what to do,

204
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,358
and you got what you wanted!

205
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,671
Eitheryou get them by the throat
orthey get you by the throat!

206
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,116
Howmany articles
did you tearup in those days?

207
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,317
- Dozens.
- And howmany official papers?

208
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,313
- I'm not allowed to!
- Not allowed to?

209
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,439
Darling, you're the Minister,
you can do anything you like.

210
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,795
No, Humphrey, I've decided
that Frank was right.

211
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,234
And Bob McKenzie too.

212
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,039
The National Data Base has got
to be organised differently.

213
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Yes, Minister.

214
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,396
We want all possible
built in safeguards.

215
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,551
- Yes, Minister.
- Right away.

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,632
What precisely do you mean,
right away?

217
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,913
I mean right away.

218
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,431
I see, you mean right away?

219
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,434
- Got it in one, Humphrey.
- Well, Minister...

220
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,273
We are still in the early months
of this Government.

221
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,919
And there's an awful lot to get...

222
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,150
The Data Base rules
have got to be changed. Now!

223
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,630
- But you can't, Minister.
- Yes, I can, I'm the Minister.

224
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,512
Yes, indeed you are, Minister.

225
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,356
And quite
an excellent Ministerat that.

226
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,511
Nevermind the soft soap,
Humphrey.

227
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,030
I want all citizens to have a right
to see theirown files

228
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,875
and I want legislation to make
unauthorised access, illegal.

229
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,829
- Very well. It shall be done.
- Good.

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,396
But the legislation necessary
to give the public the right

231
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,870
to take legal action
is extremely complicated

232
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,077
and would take
considerable time to draft,

233
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,798
promulgate and enact.

234
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,555
Legislation isn't necessaryfora
citizen to see his own files, is it?

235
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,388
- No...
- Then, we'll startwith that.

236
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,836
I suppose we could manage that
slightly quicker,

237
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,310
but there's an awful lot of
administrative problems as well.

238
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,391
This must have been
examined before.

239
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,393
The Data Base has been
in preparation foryears.

240
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,199
There must have been
discussions about it.

241
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,272
- Yes, indeed.
- What conclusions were reached?

242
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,758
Humphrey, what conclusions
were reached?

243
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,998
What did my predecessor
want to do about it?

244
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,316
Humphrey, can you hearme?

245
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,473
My lips are sealed.

246
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,309
I beg yourpardon?

247
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,438
I am not at liberty to reveal
previous plans, Minister.

248
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,669
Why not?

249
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,435
Would you like everything that
you have said in this office

250
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,558
to be revealed subsequently
to one of youropponents?

251
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,715
I see. No.

252
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,714
We cannot give youropponents
political ammunition against you.

253
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,951
But Tom Sargent
was my predecessor.

254
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,680
It isn't a party
political mattersurely?

255
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,434
It's a matterof principle.
It justwouldn't be...

256
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,513
I see and we don'twant
to do anything thatwouldn't be...

257
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,715
No.

258
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,350
- Oh, excuse me, Minister.
- Yes, Bernard?

259
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,078
A slight problem, Minister.

260
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,237
Because of the adverse...

261
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,313
not entirelyfavourable press
reaction to your interview,

262
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,199
the otherChannel wants you
fortheirprogramme.

263
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,509
- Say no.
- No?

264
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,113
- Yes, no.
- Yes no?

265
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,112
- Yes, say no! That's final.
- If that's what you want.

266
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,589
But they would go ahead
with the item

267
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,513
and nobody would be there
to state yourcase.

268
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,999
No? Okay, yes.

269
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,793
No, okay, yes...

270
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,071
- Oh, I see what you mean.
- Yes.

271
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,599
Finallyfinal?

272
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,679
Thank you, Bernard.

273
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,031
What am I going to tell them
about safeguards. Humphrey?

274
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,760
Perhaps you could
remind them, Minister,

275
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,115
that Rome wasn't built in a day?

276
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,589
Tom.

277
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,834
- Oh, my dearfellow.
- Mind if I join you?

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,319
No, of course not.

279
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,389
Well, how are you enjoying
being in opposition?

280
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,671
How are you enjoying
being in Government?

281
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,752
Well, not as much as I expected,
actually.

282
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,071
- Well, not at the moment.
- Humphrey got you undercontrol?

283
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,191
It's so hard to get things done.

284
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,158
- Did you manage to get things done?
- Oh, almost nothing.

285
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,391
When I did cotton on to his technique,
there was the election.

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,751
- Technique?
- Stalling technique.

287
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,874
- Stalling technique?
- It comes in five stages.

288
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,717
First, he'll tell you there's lots
of things to be getting on with.

289
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,115
- He told me that this morning.
- Quite.

290
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,512
Then, if you still persist,
he'll say something like

291
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,877
"Ah, yes, Minister,
I quite appreciate the intention,

292
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,996
certainly something
ought to be done,

293
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,277
but are you sure this is
the rightway to achieve it?".

294
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,873
I must make a note of this.

295
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,476
Now, if you are still undeterred,
he will shift his ground.

296
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,558
He will shift from telling you
how to do it

297
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,472
to when you should do it.

298
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,113
I mean, he'll say,

299
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,640
"Now, Minister, this is not the right time,
forall sorts of reasons".

300
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,553
- And Ministers settle forthat?
- Well, lots do.

301
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,633
And if you don't, he'll say that
the policy"has run into difficulties".

302
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,759
- Such as?
- Technical, political, legal...

303
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,158
Legal are the best sort.

304
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,959
He can make those
totally incomprehensible.

305
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,279
And with any luck, this technique
will have lasted forthree years

306
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,000
and you'll be at the final stage
when he says:

307
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,913
"We're getting very close
to the next general election.

308
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,071
Are you sure you can get
this policy through?"

309
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,196
Howhas it taken three years?

310
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,796
Sir Humphrey will do absolutely
nothing unless you chase him.

311
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,871
And you've got
fartoo much to do.

312
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,589
You see, it's what they call
"creative inertia".

313
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,997
What's the policy you're trying
to get through anyway?

314
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,118
I'm trying to make
this National Integrated Data Base

315
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,952
a bit less of a Big Brother.

316
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,392
Oh, is that what it is?

317
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,358
- He's told you it's all quite new?
- Well, yes.

318
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,636
My dearfellow,
we spent years on that.

319
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,268
We had a White Paper
when they called election.

320
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,759
I've done it all.

321
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,278
- And administrative problems?
- I've solved them.

322
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,274
And you couldn't see
any of the previous papers?

323
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,635
No wonder.
He's wiped the slate clean.

324
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,473
D'you knowwhat his next move's
gonna be?

325
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,313
- No.
- Howmany boxes have you got?

326
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,630
- Three? Four?
- Five.

327
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,439
Did he tell you not to worry
about the fifth one?

328
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,114
- Yes.
- Right. I'll take a bet.

329
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,192
You will find at the bottom
of the fifth box a memo

330
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,194
which explains exactly why
any newmoves on the Data Base

331
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,476
must be delayed.
If you don't find it,

332
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,837
he won't do anotherblind thing,
but in six month's time

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,788
he'll say that he has told you
all about it.

334
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,035
Tom, you were in office foryears.
You know all the Civil Service tricks.

335
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,839
Not all, old boy.
Just a fewhundred.

336
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,913
And how do you make them do
something they don'twant to do?

337
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,831
My dearfellow, if I knew that
I wouldn't be in Opposition.

338
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,992
But I don't get it.
Tom's the opposition.

339
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,798
Why did he tell you all this?

340
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,475
- The Opposition aren't the opposition.
- Of course not. Silly of me.

341
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,757
- They are called that.
- They're the opposition in exile.

342
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,473
The Civil Service are
the Opposition in residence.

343
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,869
Now then, bottom of the fifth box,
Tom said.

344
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,998
But you can't really do anything.

345
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,309
Oh, can't I?

346
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,954
Tom's given me all his papers
on the Data Base.

347
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,198
Three year's worth!

348
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,748
Marvellous!

349
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,833
Found it.

350
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,835
It had slipped
into an 80 page report

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,752
on Welfare procedures.

352
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,269
"Safeguards
still underdiscussion...

353
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,196
programme not finalised...

354
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,398
nothing precipitate...

355
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,112
failing instructions to the contrary,
propose await developments".

356
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Typical!

357
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,989
- Ring Humphrey and tell him.
- I'll see him first thing.

358
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,999
- Ring him now!
- It's two o'clock.

359
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,515
- He'll be fast asleep.
- Exactly!

360
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,795
Annie.

361
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,315
Why should he be asleep
and you're still working?

362
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,789
He's had you on the run.
Now it's yourturn.

363
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,477
I couldn't do that.

364
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,668
What's his number?

365
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,157
Itwas in the fifth box,
you couldn't have got to it earlier.

366
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,509
True.

367
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
Yes?

368
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,834
Humphrey,
sorry to ring you so late.

369
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,471
I didn't interrupt you
in the middle of dinner, did I?

370
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,195
No, we finished dinner
some while ago.

371
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,918
- Oh, good.
- What's the time?

372
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,553
Er, two a. m.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,589
- Good God, what's the crisis?
- No. No crisis.

374
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,991
I'm going through my boxes, and
I knew you'd still be hard at it.

375
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,392
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Nose to the grindstone.

376
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,518
Well, I've just come across
this Data Base paper.

377
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,671
Oh, you've found...
you've read it!

378
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,072
Thought I'd bettertell you
I'm not happy with it.

379
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,630
You'll welcome an opportunity
to work on something else.

380
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,031
- You didn't mind my calling you?
- No. Not at all Minister.

381
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,197
Always a pleasure
to hearfrom you.

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,992
I meant to tell him to see me
about it before Cabinet.

383
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,593
Don't ring him now.

384
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,191
You're right, it is a bit late.

385
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,031
Give him anotherten minutes.

386
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,237
If you could be fairly quick.

387
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,039
- He does have Cabinet at 10.
- I can be very quick.

388
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,237
The word "No" is one
of the shortest in the language.

389
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,271
Sorry to be so late.
Lots of reading to do this morning.

390
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,195
Good morning, Bernard.
Thank you, George.

391
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,833
Now, Humphrey, the Data Base.

392
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,477
Have you drafted
yoursafeguards?

393
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,148
Well, Minister,
I quite appreciate your intention

394
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,959
and fully agree
that there is need forsafeguards,

395
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,633
but is this

396
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,717
- the rightway to achieve it?
- Well, it's my way.

397
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,719
One.

398
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,358
That's my decision, anyway.

399
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,394
Well this is not really the time
forall sorts of reasons.

400
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,033
Two.

401
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,033
It's the perfect time.

402
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,715
Safeguards should be developed
alongside systems,

403
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,279
that's common sense.

404
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,558
We tried all this before and
we ran into all sorts of difficulties.

405
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,949
Three.

406
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,789
Such as?

407
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,717
- Well, technical, for instance.
- No. No problems.

408
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,031
We can use the same basicfile
interrogation programme

409
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,158
as the U. S. State Dept. And
the Swedish Ministry of the Interior.

410
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,953
No problems there.

411
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,915
Yes, but there are also formidable
administrative problems.

412
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,711
And all departments are affected.

413
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,669
- An interdepartmental committee...
- No. No. No, Humphrey.

414
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,919
You'll find that the existing
security procedures are adequate.

415
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,833
This is simply an extension.
Anything more?

416
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,231
- Well, yes, Minister.
- Legal problems, forexample?

417
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,751
- Yes, Minister.
- Good, good.

418
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,629
- Do we have the legal power?
- I'll answer it. We have.

419
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,792
All personnel affected are bound
by theirstaff agreements.

420
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,509
Yes, but Minister, there will be
a need forextra staffing.

421
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,389
Will you be able to get it
through the parliamentary party?

422
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,313
Yes, I'm quite sure.
Anything further?

423
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,357
I don't think so.
We can go ahead then.

424
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,759
You're very silent.

425
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,799
You don't seem to realise
the amount of work that's involved.

426
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,269
Haven't you examined
safeguards before?

427
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,919
Underanothergovernment?

428
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,755
I remembersome written answers
to parliamentary questions.

429
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,069
Well, in the first place as we've
agreed that question is not...

430
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,558
In the second place,
if there had been investigations,

431
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,995
which there haven't
ornot necessarily,

432
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,628
orl am not at liberty
to say whetherthere have,

433
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,791
there would have been
a project team, which,

434
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,235
had it existed,
on which I cannot comment,

435
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,834
which would nowhave
disbanded if it had existed

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,070
and the members returned
to do theirdepartments,

437
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,390
if indeed there had been
any such members.

438
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,598
Ornot as the case may be.

439
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,874
- Quite so, Minister.
- I want these safeguards

440
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,837
made available immediately.

441
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,355
- Minister, it is not possible.
- It is.

442
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,033
- It isn't.
- It is.

443
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,553
- It isn't.
- It is.

444
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,393
- It isn't.
- 'Tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis, 'tis.

445
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,680
Just to remind you,
you have Cabinet at 10.00,

446
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,956
the Anglo American Society
at one,

447
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,317
and the "World in Focus"
interview, this evening.

448
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,950
- Can't you get me out of the lunch?
- It's been announced.

449
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,553
I see... I suppose I...

450
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,914
- What's that you just said?
- We can't get out of it.

451
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,310
It's been announced,
it's in the programme.

452
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,519
Thank you, Bernard.

453
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,358
Thank you very much.

454
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,033
Forwhat, Minister?

455
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,515
Foreverything, Bernard.

456
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,198
And our Man on the Spot tonight
is the Right HonourableJim Hacker,

457
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,351
MinisterforAdministrative Affairs,

458
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,910
the man at the heart of the Big
Brothercomputercontroversy.

459
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,191
He's talking to Godfrey Finch.

460
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,989
Minister, as you know there's been
an outcry this week about

461
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,869
the dossierthat the Civil Service
bureaucracy has apparently

462
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,918
been building up
on every citizen in this country.

463
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,039
Now, it's rumoured that
this is not in fact, yourown policy,

464
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,590
that you'd like to have safeguards
forthe individual citizen,

465
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,150
but that you are being totally
frustrated at every stage

466
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,834
of the game
by the Civil Service machine.

467
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,236
You know, Godfrey,

468
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,795
there's a lot of nonsence
talked about the Civil Service.

469
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,396
It's a marvellous, efficient,
professional organisation,

470
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,711
capable of enormous energy
and speed.

471
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,316
It's staffed by a lot of talented,
dedicated people

472
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,876
who do everything in theirpower
to help the Government

473
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,712
make it's policies into law.

474
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,553
Well, thank you
forthe commercial, Minister.

475
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,509
Perhaps we can start
the programme now?

476
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,599
The fact of the matter is that
the Civil Service and I

477
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,354
are in complete accord
overthis whole business

478
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,351
and I'm happy to announce
that we're nowready

479
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,718
to put ourproposals
into publication.

480
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,950
In fact, tonight I can say
that from Septemberthe first,

481
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,793
every citizen of the U. K.
Will have the absolute right

482
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,633
to inspect his personal file
and check any information

483
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,314
that he has eversupplied
to the Government.

484
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,833
Secondly,

485
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,037
no civil servant will be allowed
to examine personal files

486
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,158
from anotherdepartment, without
written authorityfrom a Minister.

487
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,949
And I shall be announcing in the House
next week legislation

488
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,556
enabling citizens to take legal action
against any civil servant

489
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,473
who gains unauthorised
access to his file.

490
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,717
Encouraging, Minister.

491
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,197
Why did you not say so first,
and put people's minds at rest?

492
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,353
I didn't believe that the Civil Service
could meet ourdeadlines.

493
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,590
But they've convinced me
that they can.

494
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,910
And, in fact,
my Permanent Secretary

495
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,672
has staked his reputation on it.

496
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,594
And if not, heads will roll...

497
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,037
Anyway, Assistant Heads.

498
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,115
Thank you very much, Minister.

499
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,919
- It can't be done.
- It's been announced on TV.

500
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,436
Bernard, what did you make
of our Minister's performance?

501
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,956
Well, I... I think it's check mate,
Sir Humphrey.

502
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,590
See me on the box last night,
Humphrey?

503
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,599
Of course, Minister.

504
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,830
Howwas I? Good?

505
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,553
A most remarkable performance,
Minister, if I may say so.

506
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,154
- You may, you may.
- Thank you, Minister.

507
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,117
We have been working
very hard all night,

508
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,548
and I'm happy to be able to tell you
thatwe have come up

509
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,030
with some draft proposals
which would enable you to achieve

510
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,589
yourdesired objectives
by the stated dates.

511
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,875
Well done.

512
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,430
I told the nation how splendid
you were and I was right.

513
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,752
- I had every confidence in you.
- Quite so, Minister.

514
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,872
You must have had quite a night.

515
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,789
- Yes, Minister, quite a night!
- Let's see yourproposals.

516
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,308
Here they are.

517
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,638
And here are mine.

518
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,751
You have specific proposals too?

519
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,393
Oh, indeed I have.

520
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,836
Now, Humphrey, you read out
what you've got on safeguards,

521
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,037
and I'll read out what I've got
and we'll see how they compare.

522
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,155
"Personal data 1A:

523
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,559
Safeguards must be applied
with reference to...

524
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,988
Two criteria.

525
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,953
The need to know
and the right to know.

526
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,110
1A1. The need to know

527
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,552
only those officials...

528
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,837
forwhom the information
was submitted may be deemed,

529
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,560
prime facie,
to have a need to know.

530
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,275
We seem to be of the same mind,
Humphrey.

531
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,668
Indeed, Minister.

532
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,629
Where did those proposals
come from?

533
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,828
Minister?

534
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,193
Can you hearme?

535
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,473
Where did those proposals
come from?

536
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,750
Humphrey, my lips are sealed.
