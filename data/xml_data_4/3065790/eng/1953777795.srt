1
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:04,068
My siblings and I
are the first vampires

2
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,554
in all of history,
the Originals.

3
00:00:06,555 --> 00:00:09,974
300 years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

4
00:00:09,975 --> 00:00:12,893
Now we have returned
to find the city has a new king,

5
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:15,529
one who rules with the aid
of a powerful girl.

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,315
They have taken possession
of my brother Elijah.

7
00:00:18,316 --> 00:00:20,985
A coven of witches
want this girl for themselves.

8
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,770
The seek to enlist my help,

9
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:25,239
using my unborn child
as leverage,

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,491
though I suspect they have
ulterior motives.

11
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:34,447
So I've made a plan
of my own.

12
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:37,701
I will free my brother and
reclaim the city for our family.

13
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:39,919
Then I will be King.

14
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,915
Over the course of my life,

15
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,635
I've encountered no shortage
of those who would presume

16
00:00:54,636 --> 00:00:57,270
to speak of good and evil.

17
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,109
Such terms mean nothing.

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,817
People do what is
in their best interest,

19
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:12,335
regardless of who gets hurt.

20
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:17,774
Is it evil to take
what one wants,

21
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:21,045
to satisfy hunger
even if doing so

22
00:01:21,046 --> 00:01:23,130
will cause another suffering?

23
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,166
What some would call evil

24
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:27,468
I believe to be
an appropriate response

25
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:30,954
to a harsh and unfair world.

26
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:32,640
No offense,
but I'm not sure I follow

27
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,841
why you've
invited me here.

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,945
Because I enjoy
your company,

29
00:01:37,946 --> 00:01:39,747
and I sense you have
the capacity

30
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:43,734
for understanding
someone of my complexity.

31
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:46,020
You see, I returned
to New Orleans

32
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:48,972
to investigate a threat
posed against me.

33
00:01:48,973 --> 00:01:51,141
What I found was
a young woman,

34
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:53,744
pregnant, in need
of protection.

35
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:55,329
My brother, always
the do-gooder,

36
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,814
tried to manipulate
me into helping her.

37
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:59,416
He thought it might
redeem me.

38
00:01:59,417 --> 00:02:01,318
Trouble is, I've
since learned

39
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,206
of another young women,
a girl really,

40
00:02:05,207 --> 00:02:07,892
one with vast potential,

41
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:12,329
held in captivity
by a tyrant.

42
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,932
I want to help both
of these women...

43
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:18,185
Protect one
and free the other.

44
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:22,672
So tell me, Cami,

45
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:25,526
does that sound
evil to you?

46
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:28,062
I don't believe in
evil as a diagnosis.

47
00:02:28,063 --> 00:02:31,181
I think you have unstable
personal relationships,

48
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:33,350
stress-related
paranoia,

49
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,519
chronic anger issues,
fear of abandonment.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,519
I think you could benefit from
talking to someone professionally.

51
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:45,696
I think I prefer
to talk to you,

52
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,798
so I'm going to
offer you a job

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,052
as my stenographer.

54
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:54,054
Ok. What are we
writing?

55
00:02:54,055 --> 00:02:56,724
My memoirs of course.

56
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,893
Someone should
know my story,

57
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:00,477
and it will give us time
to discuss

58
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,379
other riveting subjects

59
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,048
like your
handsome suitor Marcel.

60
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,599
Excuse me.
My private life is...

61
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,936
Your private life is,
as it turns out,

62
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:10,938
essential to my plans.

63
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,574
You see, Marcel
wants you,

64
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,342
and because of that,
he will trust you,

65
00:03:15,343 --> 00:03:18,279
which serves me.

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,748
The thing is
the French quarter is

67
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:22,750
on the verge of war.

68
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:25,936
On the one side,
there's me,

69
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:30,257
and on the other Marcel

70
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:32,209
and an army of vampires.

71
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,129
What?!

72
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,298
You're frightened.

73
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:39,015
Don't be.

74
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:50,027
I'm not scared anymore.

75
00:03:50,028 --> 00:03:51,695
That's amazing.
How did you...

76
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,314
It's called compulsion.

77
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,982
It's a neat bit
of vampire trickery.

78
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:57,201
I'll tell you
all about it,

79
00:03:57,202 --> 00:04:02,989
but first, let's talk
a little more about Marcel.

80
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:09,746

81
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:11,482
Sucker's resilient.

82
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,751
He's like a cockroach
in a suit.

83
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:16,953
Doesn't matter. Time to give
old Elijah back to Klaus anyway.

84
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,640
You asked me to figure out
how to kill the Originals.

85
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,841
I'm not done.

86
00:04:20,842 --> 00:04:22,509
Silver dagger
hurts them,

87
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,127
but that's it.

88
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:26,647
Davina, we've been
through this.

89
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:29,633
Klaus saved my life.
I owe him one.

90
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,301
Since he wants
his brother back...

91
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:34,071
Tonight's the annual Dauphine
street music festival.

92
00:04:34,072 --> 00:04:36,273
I want to go.

93
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,025
Please.

94
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:39,309
The whole point of you
being up here

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,144
is so you're never
spotted out there.

96
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,080
You know what's smack in the
middle of Dauphine street...

97
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:45,499
Sophie Deveraux,
pain-in-the-ass witch,

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,818
and you know what the witches
will do to you if they find you.

99
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:49,336
But you control
the witches.

100
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,654
Make her go away.

101
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,089
Marcel,
it's one night.

102
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,706
I said no.

103
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,961
I do anything you say,

104
00:04:57,962 --> 00:05:02,349
but sometimes, I think you
forget what I'm capable of.

105
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,686
Did you know I can make
someone's blood boil?

106
00:05:05,687 --> 00:05:07,720
All I have to do
is focus.

107
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,077
Fine. We compromise,
all right?

108
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:32,195
You going out alone
too dangerous,

109
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:34,715
but I'll introduce you to a friend
of mine that's gonna be there,

110
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:36,467
all right, nice lady.

111
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,469
You two are really
gonna hit it off.

112
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,261
Hello, Cami.

113
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,233
How is it that when
you come up to me now

114
00:05:53,234 --> 00:05:54,601
and no one else
is around

115
00:05:54,602 --> 00:05:56,854
I suddenly remember
that you just told me

116
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,440
you're a vampire and
you're mind controlling me,

117
00:05:59,441 --> 00:06:01,275
and then you leave,
and I go back to thinking

118
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,393
you're just
some hot guy

119
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:04,711
with a cute accent
and money to burn

120
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:06,563
on your
sprawling memoir?

121
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:08,916
Well, that's how
compulsion works, love.

122
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,584
Yeah, but what's
happening?

123
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:13,003
Is it hypnosis, are my neurons
being shut down somehow?

124
00:06:13,004 --> 00:06:15,672
You're always
the curious scholar.

125
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:18,792
Let's talk about Marcel.

126
00:06:18,793 --> 00:06:22,746
You said you have a
little information for me.

127
00:06:22,747 --> 00:06:25,382
He's bringing someone
to the music festival tonight,

128
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:26,850
a girl he's mentoring.

129
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,469
Apparently she's going
through a hard time,

130
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,154
rebelling against authority,
anger issues,

131
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:31,472
that sort of thing.

132
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,756
I guess with my
psych degree

133
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:34,024
he figured I could
set her straight,

134
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,425
but I said no.

135
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:36,677
I'm gonna go ahead
and insist

136
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:39,228
you change
your answer to yes.

137
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:46,068
You're gonna force me
to do this, aren't you?

138
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,324
Why even bother
with politeness?

139
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:52,458
Because I like you.

140
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:58,448
I like the way
your mind works.

141
00:06:58,449 --> 00:06:59,883
Under different
circumstances,

142
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:02,836
I think we might
be friends.

143
00:07:02,837 --> 00:07:06,623
However, I don't
have the luxury

144
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:09,960
of passing up
tonight's opportunity.

145
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,563
You see, in addition
to being Marcel's

146
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:14,064
rather potent
secret weapon,

147
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:19,403
this girl Davina is
holding my brother captive.

148
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,955
In other words,

149
00:07:21,956 --> 00:07:24,074
the girl needs
you help.

150
00:07:24,075 --> 00:07:25,742
Call Marcel,

151
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:28,661
tell him you'll be
happy to oblige.

152
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,500
I told you, Agnes,
I feel great.

153
00:07:33,501 --> 00:07:36,170
You are overdue
for a checkup.

154
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:39,690
What am I gonna do, pop into the
quarter for a quick ultrasound?

155
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:42,593
A pregnant werewolf
escorted by a witch?

156
00:07:42,594 --> 00:07:44,061
Nothing to see here.

157
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,995
A lot of women
would kill to have a child.

158
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:48,798
Strikes me as odd that you're
not taking better care of yours.

159
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:55,222
I know a doctor out in
bayou off the beaten path.

160
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:57,558
Now I took the liberty
of making an appointment

161
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:01,361
for you tonight
after hours, just us.

162
00:08:01,362 --> 00:08:04,447
Vampires will never
get word of it.

163
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,619
Ok. Fine.

164
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,737
Bayou baby doctor
it is.

165
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,079
Please, sister, tell me
you're not still at it

166
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,363
with the Internet
search.

167
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:21,964
How does one begin
anyway,

168
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,867
just type in
"anonymous attic"?

169
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,135
Someone has to
find Elijah,

170
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:27,137
even if I have to search
every bloody attic

171
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:28,204
in New Orleans.

172
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:29,389
Like looking
for a needle

173
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,592
in a rather large pile
of needles.

174
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:34,061
I remember details about
the attic Marcel took me to.

175
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,896
There were shutters
on the windows

176
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,547
behind Elijah's coffin.

177
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,433
Well, that should
narrow it down immensely.

178
00:08:39,434 --> 00:08:41,818
Myself, I prefer
actual strategy

179
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:43,987
as opposed to
mind-numbing labor.

180
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,023
Marcel's delay
in returning our brother

181
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:50,060
makes me suspect he's no longer
in charge of the situation.

182
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,247
If Davina's loyalty
to Marcel is strained,

183
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:55,132
perhaps the young witch
will be open to

184
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,734
discussing
a new alliance.

185
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,087
As usual, your power grabs
are more important

186
00:09:00,088 --> 00:09:01,872
than rescuing
your brother.

187
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:05,759
I prefer to think of it as killing
two birds with one stone...

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,478
Rob Marcel
of his secret weapon,

189
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,631
bring our brother home.

190
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:17,887
Hey, Diego.

191
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:26,446
Right. So, um, any
way to fast track

192
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,449
the whole getting
a daylight ring thing?

193
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,102
You get a daylight right when you
get invited to the inner circle.

194
00:09:32,103 --> 00:09:34,988
For you, it may
never happen.

195
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,773
Yeah, but there's
an opening, right?

196
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,609
I mean, now that Thierry's,
like, you know...

197
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,328
You shut up
about Thierry, all right?

198
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:42,796
He didn't deserve
what he got.

199
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:45,332
Marcel was just
showing off for Klaus.

200
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,385
Can't wait till his
ancient ass is out of here.

201
00:09:48,386 --> 00:09:50,504
You and me both.

202
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,671
Look alive, boys.
We got ourselves

203
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:54,558
one high-class
Original vampire.

204
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,842
Hmm. A real charmer.

205
00:09:55,843 --> 00:09:57,677
What if I told you that
I could help you out

206
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,462
with your Klaus problem
in exchange

207
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:02,015
for the tiniest bit
of gossip?

208
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:03,450
Like what?

209
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,851
You might have heard the
rumors that Marcel and I

210
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,070
were quite the item
back in the day.

211
00:10:07,071 --> 00:10:08,304
He seems to
have moved on,

212
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:11,491
and I would like to
know with whom.

213
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:13,327
You've seen him
with the bartender.

214
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,946
What, that plain Jane
that he carries on with?

215
00:10:15,947 --> 00:10:18,782
Well, only a blind man
would choose her over me.

216
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:22,035
There must be another
girl in his harem.

217
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:26,673
Look. I just need the
tiniest bit of closure,

218
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,090
and then I can leave
New Orleans,

219
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,043
and I'll be sure to take
Klaus with me,

220
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:34,931
which, let's face it, would make
your life a whole lot easier.

221
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:38,602
Look. Marcel's got
a full plate.

222
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:39,920
If he's seeing
some other honey,

223
00:10:39,921 --> 00:10:41,388
she's somewhere
in the quarter.

224
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:44,891
She's probably close by,

225
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,309
and that, my lady,
is all I got.

226
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:02,292
Big event tonight,
a lot of people drinking,

227
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,543
a lot of eyes
watching.

228
00:11:03,544 --> 00:11:04,878
I don't want
any trouble,

229
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,246
which means
no witches.

230
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:07,530
Send word through
the cauldron.

231
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:09,466
Any witches come here,
we kill them,

232
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,134
and while we're
at it, no Originals.

233
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,969
I don't like how Rebekah's
been snooping around.

234
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,087
I got my girl Cami coming,

235
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,371
her and a little friend
of hers.

236
00:11:15,372 --> 00:11:17,257
I want eyes on them
at all times,

237
00:11:17,258 --> 00:11:19,393
eyes only, all right?

238
00:11:19,394 --> 00:11:21,094
I don't want anybody going
anywhere near either of them.

239
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:23,980
Everybody's got a post,
everybody keeps an eye out.

240
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:25,649
You cool?

241
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,192
Come on!

242
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:50,507
So is it everything
you hoped for?

243
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:53,176
Yeah!

244
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:01,768
So we should probably
go over the rules.

245
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:03,419
I won't talk to anyone
about anything,

246
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,722
I won't say anything
about witches or vampires

247
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,190
or Originals or you.

248
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,695
But you said you weren't
gonna hover.

249
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,941
This is
the doctor's office.

250
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,609
Dr. Paige is only
this far out

251
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,546
because Marcel's men kept
terrorizing her patients.

252
00:12:29,547 --> 00:12:32,298
Go. She won't bite.

253
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:46,886
Send them in now
and tell them to do it quickly.

254
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,970
It's good to see you.

255
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:16,338
I was worried you thought
I was some hot head

256
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,724
after that display
at the masquerade.

257
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,894
We all have
our hot-headed moments.

258
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:23,846
Anyway, I'm almost done
here until cleanup,

259
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,347
so the two of us girls
can hang out

260
00:13:25,348 --> 00:13:28,317
if you need to go
schmooze or whatever.

261
00:13:28,318 --> 00:13:32,637
You know, he was supposed to stop
hovering, like, 10 minutes ago.

262
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:34,990
You see what I mean?
Authority issues.

263
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,525
I'll go talk
to the mayor.

264
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:39,327
He actually knows how
to show some respect.

265
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,753
So what's his name?

266
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:51,006
Hot guy
with the fiddle.

267
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:53,258
Tim.

268
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,510
I knew he'd be here.

269
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:55,928
He always performs
at these kind of things.

270
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:57,412
How long have you two
known each other?

271
00:13:57,414 --> 00:14:00,599
Since we were 10.

272
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,334
I had to leave school,

273
00:14:02,335 --> 00:14:04,269
and I didn't get
to say good-bye,

274
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,807
so I was just hoping
to talk to him tonight.

275
00:14:11,394 --> 00:14:13,144
That's it!

276
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,876
Church is closed.

277
00:14:27,877 --> 00:14:28,961
You want your
horror fix,

278
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,262
go take
a ghost tour.

279
00:14:30,263 --> 00:14:32,030
I don't much care
for ghosts.

280
00:14:32,031 --> 00:14:34,750
I am, however, fascinated
by window shutters.

281
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,202
I've been on a town tour
of them all day.

282
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:41,757
I noticed the windows
of your attic have shutters.

283
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:45,427
Are you really
interested in shutters?

284
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:48,430
I can assure it's
my current life obsession.

285
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,565
What's your name?

286
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:51,734
Father Kieran,
and you are?

287
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:54,403
Mildly curious.

288
00:14:54,404 --> 00:14:56,337
What happened here?

289
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,795
St. Anne's used to be the
heart of the neighborhood.

290
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,614
Its been abandoned
for a while now

291
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:07,582
since the night
of the massacre.

292
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:18,626
9 seminary students were
killed by one of their own.

293
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,599
You're standing
on blood.

294
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,684
I'm not squeamish.

295
00:15:25,685 --> 00:15:26,801
Where's the attic?

296
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:29,854
Like I said, the church is closed.

297
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:34,476
Where is the attic?

298
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,696
Past the sacristy
up the stairs.

299
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:41,149
Thank you.
Now forget I was here.

300
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:51,626
I knew it.

301
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:04,789
What the bloody hell?

302
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,426
Rebekah,
language, please.

303
00:16:07,427 --> 00:16:09,076
Elijah!

304
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,900
What is all this?

305
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:16,985
You don't remember?

306
00:16:16,986 --> 00:16:20,289
You and I went to the
opera house together.

307
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,574
It was your first foray back
into New Orleans society

308
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:25,194
after Klaus removed
the dagger from you.

309
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:27,496
It's a memory that
only you and I share.

310
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:31,733
Also I need you to know it's
not another of Davina's tricks.

311
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,168
Well, how are you
even awake?

312
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:34,303
Davina withdrew
the dagger,

313
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:35,871
unaware that doing so
even once

314
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:38,040
would negate
its power.

315
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:39,991
In a few hours,
I shall be as good as new.

316
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:41,326
So put me back
into the attic,

317
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:42,677
and we can find a way
to get you out.

318
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,213
I'm afraid I'm not
quite ready

319
00:16:44,214 --> 00:16:45,997
to leave yet, Rebekah.

320
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:49,017
This girl Davina,
she's curious,

321
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,103
willful, too.

322
00:16:51,104 --> 00:16:52,504
Soon I shall be able
to speak to her,

323
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:54,723
perhaps even to propose
a truce of some kind,

324
00:16:54,724 --> 00:16:56,692
so if we can end
this war

325
00:16:56,693 --> 00:16:58,510
between the vampires
and the witches,

326
00:16:58,511 --> 00:16:59,978
we'll be able to
eliminate the threat

327
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,013
to Hayley and her baby.

328
00:17:02,014 --> 00:17:04,700
Perhaps then Niklaus
and our entire family

329
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,401
can finally know peace.

330
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,788
In the meantime,
I need you to look after Hayley.

331
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:11,855
She is our family
now, Rebekah,

332
00:17:11,857 --> 00:17:13,742
so I need her
and her unborn child

333
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:15,894
to fall underneath
our protection.

334
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:18,829
Swear to me, Rebekah.

335
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:21,415
I swear.

336
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:28,557
Your baby's heart rate
is perfect.

337
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,676
I knew it.
She's a tough one like her mom.

338
00:17:37,048 --> 00:17:40,051
That's a unique
birthmark.

339
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,770
We're pretty much
done here, right?

340
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:46,942
Your blood pressure's
a bit high.

341
00:17:46,943 --> 00:17:48,693
I've got something
for it.

342
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:18,757
Uh, you know, I'm actually
not that good with pills.

343
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:21,943
Well, me neither,
truth be told.

344
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,125
Aah!

345
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:07,990
Hello, Tim.

346
00:19:07,991 --> 00:19:11,492
I believe you and I
share an acquaintance.

347
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:16,030
Be a good lad and help
me send her a message.

348
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,704
Well, he couldn't
have gone far.

349
00:19:22,705 --> 00:19:25,207
He just got offstage
a minute ago.

350
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:27,509
It doesn't matter.
This was a stupid idea anyway.

351
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,127
No, it wasn't.
Davina...

352
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:31,763
Just forget it.

353
00:19:31,764 --> 00:19:34,349
Tell her this is
from one of the musicians.

354
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,000
She'll want to leave,

355
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:38,353
and you're going to help
her slip out the back exit

356
00:19:38,354 --> 00:19:40,305
so Marcel doesn't see.

357
00:19:40,306 --> 00:19:41,506
Whatever you do,

358
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:44,308
don't let her out
of your sight.

359
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,947
Wait, Davina!

360
00:20:01,413 --> 00:20:03,298
I can't do this.

361
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:10,835
Hey.

362
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,425
Tim, I got your note.

363
00:20:13,426 --> 00:20:14,760
I got your
text message.

364
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,061
Thanks for agreeing
to meet here.

365
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:22,117
It's so amazing
to see you.

366
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:24,119
I can't even believe
I'm standing here right now.

367
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,955
I just...

368
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:29,540
Wow!

369
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,293
So where have
you been,

370
00:20:31,294 --> 00:20:33,145
and why did you
want to meet here?

371
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,980
It's so creepy,

372
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,965
all the terrible stuff
that happened.

373
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,751
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

374
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:41,136
You know, it's quiet.

375
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,721
I mean, the place can't
be bad for all time

376
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:45,924
just because one bad thing
happened, right?

377
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:48,427
Wait. No. All right.
Back up.

378
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:51,630
So where... one day,
you just stop coming to school,

379
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:54,183
and then it's like
you just vanished.

380
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:58,520
There was an emergency, and I
needed to take care of some things.

381
00:20:58,521 --> 00:20:59,855
Oh. Are you ok?

382
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,573
I mean, you look ok.

383
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:04,410
You look great
actually.

384
00:21:04,411 --> 00:21:07,662
So are you coming
back to school?

385
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:12,229
No.

386
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:20,118
But I need you to know
that even though I was away,

387
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,343
I miss you.

388
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,516
I miss seeing you
at school

389
00:21:27,517 --> 00:21:30,835
and seeing you play
your violin.

390
00:21:34,723 --> 00:21:37,509
Well...

391
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,311
This place does have
good acoustics.

392
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,205
The boy has a gift.

393
00:22:23,206 --> 00:22:27,576
You can't compel someone
to play like that.

394
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:29,945
I know what you are.

395
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:33,115
It's crazy to me,
but at least it makes sense,

396
00:22:33,116 --> 00:22:38,420
but this massacre was just
a pointless, brutal thing.

397
00:22:38,421 --> 00:22:40,722
In all your life,
have you ever heard

398
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:42,740
of anything like that,

399
00:22:42,742 --> 00:22:44,676
a good man,
an aspiring priest

400
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:48,746
just goes on a killing
spree out of nowhere.

401
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:52,584
I've seen
quite a lot

402
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:54,937
in my time.

403
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:57,773
The world is
a rather awful place.

404
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,859
Best to meet it
on its own terms.

405
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,896
No. The world
isn't awful.

406
00:23:03,897 --> 00:23:06,565
People are
not awful.

407
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,283
They want
to be good.

408
00:23:08,284 --> 00:23:10,368
Something makes
them bad,

409
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,287
something breaks
them down,

410
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:14,155
makes them snap.

411
00:23:16,325 --> 00:23:18,560
There are always signs,

412
00:23:18,561 --> 00:23:21,530
symptoms before someone
has a psychotic break.

413
00:23:21,531 --> 00:23:24,066
The guy who did this
had none of them.

414
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,084
He didn't drink,
he didn't do drugs.

415
00:23:26,085 --> 00:23:28,836
You're well-informed
on the matter.

416
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:37,145
You knew him,
didn't you?

417
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:40,115
His name was Sean.

418
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:43,151
He was my brother,

419
00:23:43,152 --> 00:23:44,969
my twin actually.

420
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,275
I can't sleep.

421
00:23:50,276 --> 00:23:54,196
I dream about
what happened,

422
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:55,664
and I hate it.

423
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:58,250
I hate that
I couldn't help him.

424
00:23:58,251 --> 00:24:01,920
We all must stand alone
against our demons.

425
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:06,791
What if someday his
demons become mine, too?

426
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:12,214
I have some business

427
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:13,699
I should attend to,

428
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,135
but before I do,

429
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,437
you should go.

430
00:24:18,438 --> 00:24:22,557
Enjoy the music,
put this out of your mind.

431
00:24:32,651 --> 00:24:34,184
Marcel.

432
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,573
Father Kieran,
welcome back.

433
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,024
I wasn't sure when
you'd be coming home.

434
00:24:39,025 --> 00:24:40,626
I can tell,

435
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:43,495
judging by what's going
on in my church attic.

436
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,631
Oh. I didn't think
you'd mind.

437
00:24:45,632 --> 00:24:48,133
Lord knows, I'd done
you a favor or two.

438
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:52,537
I take it you know
the Originals have returned.

439
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:55,557
The sister Rebekah,
I saw her earlier,

440
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:58,809
snooping around the church,
asking about the attic.

441
00:24:58,811 --> 00:25:01,229
She doesn't know
I take vervain.

442
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,649
You got a problem
on your hands.

443
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,567
No disrespect for
the grieving process,

444
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,902
for you and your church,

445
00:25:06,903 --> 00:25:08,904
but just so I know,
are you here to help,

446
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:12,908
or are you just gonna
drop in with criticism?

447
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,911
Never forget, Marcel,

448
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:18,196
that you live
in this city by the grace

449
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:20,698
of those that know
your secret

450
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,035
and tolerate you.

451
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,121
And this city thrives
because of me

452
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:27,506
and my people.

453
00:25:27,507 --> 00:25:28,907
Anytime you need
a reminder of that,

454
00:25:28,908 --> 00:25:32,410
just let me know.

455
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:36,581
Marcel, Diego said
he lost eyes on the girls.

456
00:25:36,582 --> 00:25:38,099
To be continued.

457
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:49,528
You two are
absolutely adorable.

458
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:51,396
It warms my heart,
it really does,

459
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:53,231
but I do need a word
with the young lady,

460
00:25:53,232 --> 00:25:56,818
so, Tim,
go sit down,

461
00:25:56,819 --> 00:26:01,106
count to 100,000.

462
00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:03,291
Quietly now.
There's a good boy.

463
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:06,244
I assume you know
who I am.

464
00:26:06,245 --> 00:26:09,113
Then let's get right to it,
shall we?

465
00:26:14,503 --> 00:26:18,623
Your current dilemma strikes
me as a case of poor alliances.

466
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,792
You're loyal to Marcel,

467
00:26:20,793 --> 00:26:23,211
and yet he keeps you
tucked away in an attic.

468
00:26:23,212 --> 00:26:28,433
Surely you'd prefer just
a little bit more freedom,

469
00:26:28,434 --> 00:26:31,319
and yet Marcel
keeps you prisoner.

470
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,021
Marcel doesn't
keep me prisoner.

471
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:34,523
He keeps me safe.

472
00:26:34,524 --> 00:26:35,990
He's my friend.

473
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:38,026
Well, I have
no doubt he is,

474
00:26:38,027 --> 00:26:42,664
but for a girl caught in a war
between the witches and the vampires,

475
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:46,184
I might be
a better friend.

476
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:49,421
I would keep you safe,

477
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:53,675
and I'd allow you
your freedom.

478
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:56,428
If Marcel could do that,

479
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:58,329
why hasn't he
done so already,

480
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,349
and it does
beg the question

481
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,668
if Marcel can't
protect you,

482
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:05,687
then what of those
you care about?

483
00:27:05,688 --> 00:27:08,857
If anyone tries to hurt
anyone I care about,

484
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:10,058
I'll kill them.

485
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:11,510
Well, then.

486
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:15,112
Sounds like you don't
need Marcel at all.

487
00:27:15,114 --> 00:27:18,116
Perhaps you've
suspected it all along.

488
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:20,986
Your dear friend
Marcel tricks you

489
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:22,704
into doing
his bidding,

490
00:27:22,705 --> 00:27:27,876
and all the while, you
rot in an attic alone

491
00:27:27,877 --> 00:27:32,080
while young Timothy
moves on with his life.

492
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,382
You feel that?

493
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:37,251
That's your blood
starting to boil.

494
00:27:44,042 --> 00:27:45,543
Such a shame
to lose him

495
00:27:45,544 --> 00:27:47,145
just as you found
him again,

496
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:50,649
and I really did admire
your skill with that violin.

497
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,566
Don't you dare
hurt him!

498
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,236
Well, I hope I won't
have to, sweetheart,

499
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:56,771
but then that
depends on you.

500
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:08,750
Let him go now!

501
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:11,486
You should know I don't
do well with demands.

502
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:14,205
Ugh! Aah!

503
00:28:14,206 --> 00:28:15,957
Unh!

504
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:18,709
Impressive, but you don't
want to fight me, love.

505
00:28:18,711 --> 00:28:20,027
Innocent people
have a way

506
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:21,496
of winding up dead.

507
00:28:21,497 --> 00:28:22,547
Please let me go.

508
00:28:22,548 --> 00:28:24,499
Your choice,
little witch.

509
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,050
Swear allegiance
to me alone,

510
00:28:26,051 --> 00:28:27,552
and the boy lives.

511
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,920
Stand against me...

512
00:28:37,428 --> 00:28:39,947
Aah!

513
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:22,089
I have to say
I'm impressed.

514
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,224
How'd you find me?

515
00:29:23,225 --> 00:29:24,392
Your text got me
halfway,

516
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:25,810
vamp hearing
did the rest.

517
00:29:25,811 --> 00:29:26,928
Who are they?

518
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:29,563
Witches, warlocks,
whatever.

519
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,068
There are more of them.

520
00:29:34,069 --> 00:29:35,652
Run!

521
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:38,606
If I had a dollar
for every mess

522
00:29:38,607 --> 00:29:40,774
my family's gotten
me into.

523
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:45,747
Rebekah!

524
00:29:57,725 --> 00:29:59,427
Where is she?
Where's Davina?

525
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:02,146
She went to meet a boy
in St. Anne's church.

526
00:30:02,147 --> 00:30:04,631
Stay here in case
she comes back.

527
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:22,866
What the hell?

528
00:30:24,535 --> 00:30:28,577
Hayley? Hayley?

529
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:38,882
Tim.

530
00:30:45,172 --> 00:30:46,858
What do you mean
she's missing?

531
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:48,142
What do you
think I mean?

532
00:30:48,143 --> 00:30:49,811
There's blood and bodies
everywhere,

533
00:30:49,812 --> 00:30:51,279
someone's ripped
this lot to shreds,

534
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,283
and there's no
smart-aleck pregnant girl.

535
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,734
Keep looking.
I'm on my way.

536
00:31:01,823 --> 00:31:03,491
Please don't hurt me.

537
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:05,460
It wasn't
my intent to,

538
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:09,497
but sadly,
I've run out of time to play nice.

539
00:31:26,555 --> 00:31:28,723
Tim? Oh, no!

540
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:31,843
No, please.

541
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,762
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

542
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:35,931
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

543
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,299
One of the tragic
consequences of war,

544
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,803
innocent bystanders.

545
00:31:41,804 --> 00:31:44,105
What terrible guilt
you'll have to live with,

546
00:31:44,106 --> 00:31:46,992
young Timothy's blood
on your hands.

547
00:31:46,993 --> 00:31:48,141
Get away from him!

548
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:50,311
Now, now, let's not
be hasty.

549
00:31:50,312 --> 00:31:53,581
After all, I can
heal him.

550
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:58,485
All you have to do...

551
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:02,106
Is ask.

552
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:11,049
Please.

553
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,436
For you, Davina,
with pleasure.

554
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,990
You will forget everything that
happened after the concert,

555
00:32:34,991 --> 00:32:39,694
including the fact
that you saw Davina.

556
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:42,130
What? No.

557
00:32:42,131 --> 00:32:43,832
If he remembers
seeing you,

558
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:45,333
he might come looking.

559
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:46,534
If the witches learn
of him,

560
00:32:46,535 --> 00:32:47,752
if they know you have
a weakness,

561
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:49,871
then poor Tim might
end up as leverage

562
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:53,925
in an awful scheme
to control you again.

563
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:57,646
Ok. Come on.
Up you come.

564
00:32:57,647 --> 00:32:59,731
Take your violin case
with you.

565
00:32:59,732 --> 00:33:04,169
You'll remember losing the instrument
backstage after the performance.

566
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:09,074
You really should be
more careful.

567
00:33:09,075 --> 00:33:11,192
All fixed.

568
00:33:11,193 --> 00:33:13,360
Now you owe me
a favor.

569
00:33:31,546 --> 00:33:34,382
Davina.

570
00:33:34,383 --> 00:33:35,750
What happened?

571
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,352
What are you
doing here?

572
00:33:37,353 --> 00:33:39,419
I live her, remember?

573
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:56,388
Well, you abandoned
your quest for power

574
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:58,239
to help out
your family.

575
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,541
Having an off day?

576
00:33:59,542 --> 00:34:00,541
Who took her, Rebekah?

577
00:34:00,543 --> 00:34:01,710
I don't know.

578
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:04,112
What do you mean
you don't know?

579
00:34:04,113 --> 00:34:05,714
Then who killed
her attackers?

580
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:08,783
I don't know.
I had an arrow in my heart.

581
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:10,552
If it wasn't Hayley
who killed them, then...

582
00:34:14,724 --> 00:34:18,458
Lovely. Perhaps her cousins
will know where she is.

583
00:34:23,965 --> 00:34:28,603
Hayley, what happened?
Tell me what happened.

584
00:34:28,604 --> 00:34:32,140
I can't remember.

585
00:34:32,141 --> 00:34:34,526
You've completely healed.

586
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:35,910
There's not
a scratch on you.

587
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:38,163
One of the perks
of being a werewolf, remember?

588
00:34:38,164 --> 00:34:40,115
No. Not that fast

589
00:34:40,116 --> 00:34:41,648
Leave her alone.

590
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,537
It's the baby,

591
00:34:45,538 --> 00:34:49,958
the vampire blood,
Klaus' blood in your system.

592
00:34:49,959 --> 00:34:53,094
It can heal
any wound.

593
00:34:53,095 --> 00:34:56,831
Your own child
healed you.

594
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:57,981
How did you escape?

595
00:34:57,983 --> 00:35:00,602
You were outnumbered,
unarmed.

596
00:35:00,603 --> 00:35:04,105
Those men were
ripped to shreds.

597
00:35:04,106 --> 00:35:07,442
I think it was
the wolf.

598
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:09,227
I think it's trying
to protect me.

599
00:35:09,228 --> 00:35:13,114
The witches were
supposed to protect you.

600
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:14,699
When I get my hands
on Sophie Deveraux...

601
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,201
It wasn't Sophie.

602
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:17,368
It was Agnes.

603
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:18,486
Fine. Agnes, Sophie.

604
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,171
It's all the same to me.

605
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:21,289
I'll slaughter
the lot of them.

606
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,690
Not if Elijah
gets there first.

607
00:35:22,691 --> 00:35:25,693
Elijah?

608
00:35:25,694 --> 00:35:26,978
Did you find him?

609
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:30,698
He's been in touch,
and he has a plan.

610
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:33,467
All he asked is that
we take care of you.

611
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:43,060
Hey. So can we
go home now?

612
00:35:43,062 --> 00:35:46,180
I'd really like to
sleep for a few days.

613
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:50,718
Whoa!

614
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,887
I've got you, love.
I've got you.

615
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,483
I was crystal clear...

616
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:09,652
Eyes on my girls
at all times.

617
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:12,538
What? Girl's little friend
sneaks away from your party,

618
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:14,323
and that's my fault?

619
00:36:14,324 --> 00:36:17,709
What, Marcel, you gonna send
me to the garden now, too?

620
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,385
When he wakes up,

621
00:36:26,386 --> 00:36:28,220
tell him that an apology
would have gotten him

622
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:31,089
a lot further
than his attitude.

623
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,846
Awful what happened
at the church.

624
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,748
I hear they're
calling it a gas leak.

625
00:36:39,749 --> 00:36:41,483
Such a pity.

626
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:43,719
I heard that you were quite
the woman on a mission today.

627
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,988
What can I say?
I want Elijah back.

628
00:36:45,989 --> 00:36:48,072
Is that all you want?

629
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:51,627
You'll get Elijah back.

630
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:53,545
In the meantime,
stay out of this bar

631
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,447
and stay away
from my guys.

632
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:56,915
What's wrong?
You jealous?

633
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:59,168
Me? I've already found
my queen.

634
00:36:59,169 --> 00:37:02,538
Cami the bartender?

635
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:05,674
Stop fooling
yourself, Marcel.

636
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:06,925
She's comfort food,

637
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:08,627
something to
distract you

638
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,328
from what you
really want,

639
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,930
which after all
these years

640
00:37:11,931 --> 00:37:13,432
is impossible to deny

641
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:16,017
because I'm standing
right in front of you.

642
00:37:37,658 --> 00:37:40,409
Klaus?

643
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,576
What are you
doing here?

644
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,795
I've had
quite a night.

645
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:50,836
I recall you mentioned something
about nightmares and insomnia.

646
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:54,673
I believe I can help.
May I come in?

647
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,508
This is superweird.
Come in.

648
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,848
Wait.

649
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,284
That's right.
I told you what happened.

650
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:11,284
I never tell anybody,
but I told you,

651
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:13,692
and you said something
about Sean standing

652
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:16,195
alone
against his demons.

653
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,613
When he killed
those men,

654
00:38:17,614 --> 00:38:19,198
I thought he must be
mentally ill,

655
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,735
but what if
it was demons?

656
00:38:23,736 --> 00:38:25,821
What if a vampire
compelled him?

657
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:27,790
And if so,
would you devote yourself

658
00:38:27,791 --> 00:38:30,659
to finding
the guilty party?

659
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,763
Would you sacrifice everything
to find out the truth?

660
00:38:34,764 --> 00:38:36,581
To what end?

661
00:38:36,582 --> 00:38:38,267
To what end?

662
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:40,969
This is the entire reason
I'm in New Orleans.

663
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,755
Cami, whatever lies on the
other end of this mystery

664
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,191
will only offer
you pain.

665
00:38:46,192 --> 00:38:49,394
Nothing will bring
your brother back.

666
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:53,448
Your only hope for peace
is to forget this...

667
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:55,067
No.

668
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,318
And move on.

669
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:57,452
No. Don't compel me
to forget this.

670
00:38:57,453 --> 00:38:59,371
And if I allow you
to remember,

671
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,540
the knowledge
will eat away at you.

672
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,877
Your quest for truth will
only put you in danger.

673
00:39:04,878 --> 00:39:06,912
You don't care
about me!

674
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:09,214
You just want me to forget this
so I can be focused on Marcel,

675
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:12,284
so I'll be a good,
little spy for you.

676
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:14,553
I need your
loyalty, yes,

677
00:39:14,554 --> 00:39:16,088
and, though that
may appear selfish to you,

678
00:39:16,089 --> 00:39:19,007
the scope of my plan
goes far beyond myself.

679
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:24,897
Power aside, I am trying
to honor my brother.

680
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:27,465
What about my brother,

681
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:30,635
my twin brother?

682
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:34,022
We were bonded
our whole lives,

683
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:38,744
and I know, I know
he didn't just snap,

684
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,612
and I need to know
who did this,

685
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:43,415
and I need to
make this right.

686
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:46,650
No. Don't take this
away from me!

687
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,654
You will do nothing.

688
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,757
Your bother was ill.

689
00:39:51,758 --> 00:39:54,993
He killed those people
and himself,

690
00:39:54,994 --> 00:39:58,496
and it was a tragedy.

691
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:02,633
All you can do
is move on.

692
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,398
Know that your brother
is at peace

693
00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:20,319
and that you
needn't worry.

694
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,487
I will find out
what happened,

695
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:25,157
and when I do,

696
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:29,878
I will make sure
whoever harmed your brother

697
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:32,831
will suffer,

698
00:40:32,832 --> 00:40:35,801
and as for you,

699
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:38,921
tonight, you will sleep,

700
00:40:38,922 --> 00:40:44,709
and you will dream of a world
far better than this one,

701
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:50,732
a world where there is
no evil, no demons,

702
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:54,018
and all people desire...

703
00:40:57,522 --> 00:40:59,991
Only to be good.

704
00:41:43,485 --> 00:41:47,439
It's all right,
Davina.

705
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,575
I don't mean you
any harm,

706
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:53,461
though I do think it's
time we had a talk.

707
00:41:59,305 --> 00:42:03,328
