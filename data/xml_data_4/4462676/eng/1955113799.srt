1
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:16,561
Sorry about the hiccup, folks.

2
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:18,723
Won't be long.

3
00:01:28,904 --> 00:01:31,397
You got five minutes.

4
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:36,819
Howdy, folks!

5
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:41,675
Can someone tell me if Mrs.
Alma May Urbano is on board?

6
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:43,937
Alma May Urbano?

7
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,998
There you are!

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,162
Hello, dear.

9
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:50,025
Very good to meet you.

10
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:50,590
My name's Jimmy.

11
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,586
I tried to visit
you at Sandpiper,

12
00:01:52,588 --> 00:01:54,315
but they wouldn't allow me to.

13
00:01:54,317 --> 00:01:56,544
Hey, you know what?
It doesn't matter.

14
00:01:56,546 --> 00:02:01,168
I saw your bus broken down.
Here you are! Lucky me!

15
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,333
Do you prefer to be called

16
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,792
Mrs. Urbano or Alma May
or just plain Alma?

17
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:09,251
My last name is McGill,
but you can call me Jimmy.

18
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,114
Hey, everyone.
My name's Jimmy McGill,

19
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,742
I'm an attorney at law. But...

20
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,139
Don't mind me.

21
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,168
Just talk amongst yourselves.

22
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,858
Now, Alma May, do you recall responding
to a mailer from my law firm,

23
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,451
Davis & Main of
Santa Fe, New Mexico?

24
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:27,181
I... I don't know.

25
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:30,939
We were looking to help
any Sandpiper residents

26
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:36,295
who may have been overcharged
for basic goods and services.

27
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,024
Now, does that ring a bell?

28
00:02:38,026 --> 00:02:40,885
Oh! Maybe. Was it yellow?

29
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:44,111
It's canary yellow.
I picked that color myself!

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,003
Well, ma'am, I'm here to make
sure you get your money back.

31
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:50,964
What're you talking about?
Who took Alma May's money?

32
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:54,058
Uh, well,
that's a very good question.

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,019
And thank you for asking,
Mister...

34
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,582
Amos. Amos Lydecker.

35
00:02:58,584 --> 00:03:00,378
Mr. Lydecker, Jimmy McGill.

36
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,535
Now, nobody took
anybody's money, exactly.

37
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:07,829
Okay? It's not like the
Sandpiper people, you know,

38
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:14,548
put on a ski mask and mugged
Alma May here at gunpoint.

39
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,675
So, I want you to put that mental
image right out of your head.

40
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:18,939
See, what we're talking
about here

41
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,668
is more of a...
It's just a discrepancy.

42
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,893
It's just a little thing.
It's fairly innocent.

43
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:26,922
But, we need to fix it.

44
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,718
You follow me?

45
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,247
Well, put it this way.

46
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:34,739
Alma May, let's say you're out
on a date with your boyfriend.

47
00:03:34,741 --> 00:03:37,567
You do have a boyfriend, right?

48
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,962
Ah! You don't? Come on!

49
00:03:39,964 --> 00:03:42,323
Alma May's holding out on me.

50
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,718
Do you have a nephew?

51
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,213
Nephew? Oh, yes. Steve.

52
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:48,843
Okay, Steve,
is he a good guy?

53
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:50,008
Yes, very good.

54
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,697
Okay. So let's say you and
Steve go out to dinner at,

55
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:55,429
well, Birdie's.

56
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:57,691
That's where you're
all headed today, right?

57
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,388
All right.

58
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,849
So, both of you
have a great meal.

59
00:04:01,851 --> 00:04:06,706
Chicken fried steak and green
beans, and it's all perfect.

60
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,570
Here comes the check...

61
00:04:07,572 --> 00:04:13,991
"Hey, wait a dog-gone, 24 bucks for
a side of buttermilk biscuits?"

62
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,920
- That doesn't sound right now, does it?
- No.

63
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:21,142
No, it does not. It sounds like
something got added up wrong.

64
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:24,602
Well naturally, you send your nephew,
Steve, to talk to the manager.

65
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:28,128
And naturally, the manager
corrects the mistake.

66
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,356
And what's more,
he gives you a coupon

67
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:34,348
for a free meal next time you come in.
How about that!

68
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:40,036
Well, that same kind of thing is
what happened at Sandpiper Crossing.

69
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:46,257
And nothing makes me sadder

70
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,682
than to see people
of the Greatest Generation,

71
00:04:49,684 --> 00:04:53,042
people like my
own Nana and Bobo,

72
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:57,167
getting overcharged
by some great big company.

73
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,230
Even if it was an accident.

74
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:02,822
Now, I know that
the good people

75
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:05,017
at Sandpiper want
to make this right.

76
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:06,049
Sooner or later.

77
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:09,807
But you know what?
Well, sometimes,

78
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,071
it's just easier

79
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:16,792
if you get your nephew, Steve,
to go take care of it for you.

80
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:21,084
And that's how I
want you to think of me.

81
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:25,807
Georgiana. Hey there, Georgie Girl.
Thank you.

82
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,104
Oh! It's all there,
everything I need.

83
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,799
Thank you so much.
Enjoy your lunch.

84
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:35,620
Alma May. You did it. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

85
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:37,749
Thank you, Henry.

86
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,576
All right. Hey, Sue...

87
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,640
Okay.

88
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,266
Beautiful penmanship!
A lost art...

89
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,629
Schweikart and Cokely are
pursuing an aggressive strategy,

90
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,192
but looking at
the relevant case law,

91
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:08,651
I don't think it's going to play
with this magistrate judge.

92
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:11,312
I've read over a dozen of
her rulings, all of which

93
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:14,606
have sided with the plaintiff
on cases like this.

94
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,533
I've included a memo to that
effect in today's materials,

95
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:18,963
which you can
peruse at your leisure.

96
00:06:18,965 --> 00:06:24,219
Thanks, Erin. How about we
move on to client outreach?

97
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,175
Jimmy?

98
00:06:29,776 --> 00:06:31,104
You still with us?

99
00:06:31,106 --> 00:06:32,069
Uh...

100
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:33,566
I'm going to save you
from having to brag.

101
00:06:33,568 --> 00:06:37,723
Over 200 new Sandpiper clients
signed over the past three weeks.

102
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:40,052
Well done, Jimmy.
Thank you.

103
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:40,684
Thanks, Cliff.

104
00:06:40,686 --> 00:06:42,613
Uh, right now,
we're in the process

105
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:44,643
of mapping out
the entire Southwest,

106
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:48,334
targeting the largest
Sandpiper facilities first.

107
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:51,860
Phoenix, Colorado Springs,
Fort Worth, Provo.

108
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,626
That's just for starters.

109
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:56,618
Ideally, my goal, another 200
by the end of the month.

110
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,908
With this many folks, we have an
excellent shot at a solid batch

111
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,769
of plaintiffs for the classes
in each district.

112
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,229
Excellent. Look forward
to the next report.

113
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:10,821
On to a stickier wicket,
coordinating actions.

114
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:12,218
Um, sorry.
Before we move on.

115
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,176
I'd like to go back to client
outreach, just for a moment.

116
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:18,472
Looking over
these numbers, here.

117
00:07:18,474 --> 00:07:22,863
Really astonishing results,
Jimmy. Incredible.

118
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:25,357
Your last trip to Amarillo,

119
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,686
you came back
with 22 new clients?

120
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,748
Twenty-four.
Twenty-four.

121
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,179
I'm confused.

122
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:33,141
Um, how many people
out there actually

123
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:36,268
responded to
our direct mailer?

124
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:38,663
One.

125
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,923
Hmm. Oh, right, yeah.

126
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,883
A Mars Alma May Urbano.

127
00:07:45,384 --> 00:07:50,771
But you got 24 new clients
from this one response?

128
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,865
That is...

129
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:54,430
Wow!

130
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,824
Well, you're welcome. I mean,
what, is there a problem?

131
00:07:56,826 --> 00:08:02,346
Well, might not some parties, the
opposing counsel for example,

132
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:04,576
see this differential
and conclude that

133
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:08,201
there may have been some
solicitation involved?

134
00:08:08,203 --> 00:08:08,833
I did not solicit.

135
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,929
I'm just wondering how you
account for your success.

136
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:16,185
Because it will definitely raise
eyebrows over at Schweikart and Cokely.

137
00:08:16,852 --> 00:08:18,579
I'm sorry, but it will.

138
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,939
Particularly in a case
involving seniors

139
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:22,937
for whom
the ethical guidelines

140
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,694
on solicitation were virtually
created by the ABA.

141
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,822
Chuck, I'm sure that...

142
00:08:31,022 --> 00:08:35,045
Jimmy, if you could clear this
up that would be helpful.

143
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,505
I went to Amarillo to
confer with the client

144
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:43,893
and to make sure that we had
a solid good-faith basis

145
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:46,354
for our case there.
Overall.

146
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:47,486
As many of you are aware,

147
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:50,446
I've visited more than
my share of retirement homes.

148
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,207
These are close-knit communities.
Let me tell you,

149
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:54,970
word gets around real fast.

150
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:59,827
Dorothy in Phase 2 gets a new Rascal
Scooter, well, it's big news.

151
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:02,055
So these other 23 residents,
they approached you?

152
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:06,247
Cliff, they heard the scuttlebutt
before I crossed state lines.

153
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:10,304
And I certainly didn't have
to go knockin' on any doors.

154
00:09:10,306 --> 00:09:11,968
And is it any surprise
that they wanna

155
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,897
speak with
the guy who was there

156
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:16,226
to show them they may have
money coming their way?

157
00:09:16,228 --> 00:09:21,714
I gotta tell ya, with all that in
mind, I should've done better.

158
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,005
Makes sense. Howard?

159
00:09:27,736 --> 00:09:29,398
Chuck?

160
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,760
We good to move on?

161
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:36,150
And, Chuck,
not incidentally,

162
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:38,812
it is absolutely vital
that we dot our I's

163
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:39,976
and cross our T's here.

164
00:09:39,978 --> 00:09:42,437
Invaluable. So, thank you.

165
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:44,865
The price of excellence
is eternal vigilance.

166
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,361
Indeed.

167
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:49,789
Coordination. I believe
that's where we left off.

168
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:54,678
That's right. Brian, this is your
thing, so why don't you take this?

169
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,876
Sure.

170
00:09:55,878 --> 00:09:58,271
Considering the dimensions
of these cases,

171
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,334
taken together
and individually,

172
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:03,594
it makes sense to designate
someone to handle the scheduling.

173
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:07,285
What I'm proposing is that we
create a small team at D&M

174
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:09,181
dedicated specifically
to coordinating

175
00:10:09,183 --> 00:10:10,945
all elements of the
individual actions.

176
00:10:10,947 --> 00:10:12,774
We'll loop in HHM
when anything...

177
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:15,236
Brian. I'm sorry.
Excuse me for interrupting.

178
00:10:15,238 --> 00:10:19,061
I just want to say that
I take Chuck's point.

179
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:19,593
I do.

180
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:23,086
I mean, this is like a
"wife of Caesar" type thing.

181
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:29,206
There can't even be a hint of
solicitation, so I'm gonna pull back.

182
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:33,531
No more meet-and-greets
at Sandpiper facilities.

183
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,491
I'll find another way
to proceed.

184
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:38,553
Well, Jimmy,
we'll leave that up to you.

185
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,314
You know, client outreach
is your department.

186
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:45,206
Uh, where was I?
Okay, right.

187
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:47,568
If we have a more
consolidated nerve center

188
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:49,498
here in New Mexico,
where the...

189
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:59,177
Hey, Kim, where can I get a copy
of that Neiderman deposition?

190
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,902
I've got an extra Neiderman, Jimmy.
You can have one of mine.

191
00:11:02,904 --> 00:11:04,599
Oh, wow, thanks, Erin.

192
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,196
No worries.

193
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,458
Shoot.
Where did I put that?

194
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,387
Thanks that's...

195
00:11:12,651 --> 00:11:15,277
Man, can you believe
Chuck in there?

196
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,206
I mean, Jesus.
Solicitation?

197
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,035
Let me tell you, when we
were building this case,

198
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:21,763
I was chasing down
eighty-year-old mall walkers.

199
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,488
That was solicitation!
But did he say "boo"?

200
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,019
Bullshit, he did!

201
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:29,314
What happened in Texas?

202
00:11:29,748 --> 00:11:31,742
Nothing. I did my job.

203
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:35,002
You didn't do a song and dance in
the day room for the old-timers?

204
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:37,497
No! No.

205
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:38,794
Not in the day room.

206
00:11:38,796 --> 00:11:42,786
Jimmy, you know solicitation can
get you disbarred. This matters.

207
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:44,549
Well, here's what
I think matters,

208
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,511
twenty-four senior citizens
now have representation.

209
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:49,306
Before I went they didn't even
know they were getting ripped off.

210
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,663
Now they have us in their corner.
How is that not a win?

211
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,890
You said in there
you'd find another way.

212
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:58,852
Did you mean it?

213
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:02,478
Sure. Absolutely.

214
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:08,399
Look, I...

215
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:12,923
I need you to understand
something very critical here.

216
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:14,221
Shoot.

217
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,778
I put myself on
the line to get you this job.

218
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:20,208
Okay.

219
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,101
I thought it was because I'm
sensational with old people.

220
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:26,129
Yeah, and who do you
think told them that?

221
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:28,324
So what
you threw me a bone?

222
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,653
No. Asshole.

223
00:12:31,187 --> 00:12:33,779
You know
I believe in you.

224
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,074
But then I made my
beliefs known to them.

225
00:12:36,076 --> 00:12:39,500
Now everything you do reflects back on me.
With Howard.

226
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:40,964
Because ultimately,
I talked him into

227
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:43,758
going out on
a limb for you, too.

228
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:49,480
Do you understand? It's, it's my word.
It's my judgment.

229
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:50,910
Yeah.

230
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,093
You and I both know
you can do this job.

231
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:07,143
But please,
you just have to do it right.

232
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:17,821
Well...

233
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:22,677
You wanna make sure you put in
the batteries the right way.

234
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,640
Or it won't work.

235
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,902
Then you close him up.

236
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,532
And...

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,563
I think...

238
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:32,623
I think you're good
to go, young lady.

239
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:36,682
Why don't you give
his foot a squeeze?

240
00:13:41,307 --> 00:13:43,501
He's funny!

241
00:13:43,503 --> 00:13:45,463
Oh, darling...

242
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,454
I think I'll name you...

243
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:52,216
Mr. Snuggles.

244
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:55,110
Are you hungry?

245
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:57,604
I'm gonna get you
some mashed potatoes.

246
00:13:57,606 --> 00:14:00,831
That should get you
through to next month.

247
00:14:01,232 --> 00:14:03,492
Mike, thank you.

248
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,587
But you shouldn't
feel that you need to...

249
00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:07,849
Too late.

250
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:15,034
Something up?

251
00:14:15,934 --> 00:14:17,296
Feels like something's up.

252
00:14:17,298 --> 00:14:20,423
No. It's...
I didn't get much sleep.

253
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:21,954
My head's...

254
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:22,452
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:26,411
You tell me it's none of
my business, I'll drop it.

256
00:14:26,413 --> 00:14:28,007
I don't want you to worry.

257
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,037
Not the worrying kind.

258
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,224
Last two nights,
I heard gunshots.

259
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:40,348
First night, they were maybe a
block or two over. Woke me up.

260
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,077
My first thought
was firecrackers,

261
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,040
I mean, that's what I
assumed at the time.

262
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:44,739
But then last night...

263
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:48,265
There's no mistaking it. There was
three of them. They were quick.

264
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:50,261
Pop, pop, pop Closer.

265
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:53,521
It was like they
were right outside the house.

266
00:14:53,523 --> 00:14:54,885
You call the cops?

267
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:55,682
Yeah.

268
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:56,814
Took 'em over
an hour to get here,

269
00:14:56,816 --> 00:14:58,710
then they looked around
for a whole two minutes.

270
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:02,336
But by then, of course,
there was nothing to see.

271
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,429
I'm staying here tonight.

272
00:15:05,431 --> 00:15:07,525
No, Mike.
No, that's not necessary.

273
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,953
It is not a problem.
I'll take the couch.

274
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:14,211
Mike, you asked,
so I answered.

275
00:15:14,744 --> 00:15:17,770
Please, don't make me sorry
I told you.

276
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:24,722
Kaylee, come, hmm?

277
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,652
Get your supper.

278
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,108
What about Colorado Springs?

279
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,173
Um...

280
00:15:48,175 --> 00:15:51,333
Two hundred and eighty-three
residents, and...

281
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:52,498
We sent out 283 mailers.

282
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,223
Yeah, and how many
response cards came back?

283
00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:57,720
Zero.

284
00:15:57,722 --> 00:15:59,150
Zero?

285
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:04,007
Son of a bitch.

286
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,268
Dana, Toni.
Have a good one.

287
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,932
You too, Mr. Main.

288
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,292
Cliff, uh,
can I have a second?

289
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,090
What's up?

290
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:13,986
Uh, it's those
Sandpiper mailers.

291
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:18,044
We should be getting
responses of like 12 to 15%.

292
00:16:18,046 --> 00:16:19,740
But we're
getting ones and twos.

293
00:16:19,742 --> 00:16:21,370
In Colorado Springs, zero.

294
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,267
Wow!
How can that be?

295
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:24,464
I'm thinking it's the staff.

296
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:27,025
They're tossing the mailers before
they can reach the residents.

297
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,484
Maybe they got told to do it
by the Sandpiper front office.

298
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:33,012
Which would be
actionable as hell.

299
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:34,676
If we could prove it.

300
00:16:34,678 --> 00:16:35,774
Big "if."

301
00:16:35,776 --> 00:16:38,069
And to do so would take more
manpower than I can spare.

302
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:41,129
For now, let's just stick with
getting those client numbers up.

303
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:43,524
Guess you'd better
think of another way.

304
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,254
I think I got it.

305
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:47,782
TV commercial.
Highly targeted.

306
00:16:47,784 --> 00:16:52,040
Let me tell you, at Sandpiper,
the trains run on time.

307
00:16:52,042 --> 00:16:54,035
Mussolini would be proud.

308
00:16:54,037 --> 00:16:55,964
Every one
I've visited so far,

309
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,428
same exact schedule.

310
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:58,692
10:00 a.m., water aerobics,

311
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:00,722
2:00 p.m., line dancing.
So on, and so forth.

312
00:17:00,724 --> 00:17:04,114
They always leave 3:00 p.m.
to 4:00 p.m. free.

313
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,511
Why? <i>Murder, She Wrote.</i>

314
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:08,771
It's been in syndication
since, like, the 1850s.

315
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:10,135
And let me tell you,
when that thing comes on?

316
00:17:10,137 --> 00:17:13,894
It draws the blue-hairs like
moths to a bug zapper.

317
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:17,320
3:14 p.m., end of
the first act cliff-hanger.

318
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:22,044
First commercial up, Davis & Main.
Guaranteed eyeballs.

319
00:17:22,046 --> 00:17:22,509
Lots of 'em.

320
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,306
There's nothing
Sandpiper can do about that.

321
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:28,530
We ran a commercial a few years
back, another class action case.

322
00:17:28,532 --> 00:17:32,389
Kind of a new thing for us.
It's not exactly my go-to,

323
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,950
but generally speaking,
I'm open to it.

324
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:37,045
We will talk next week.

325
00:17:37,047 --> 00:17:40,272
Great! Safe travels.

326
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:11,041
<i>Mesothelioma is</i>
<i>a rare lung disease</i>

327
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:13,669
<i>usually associated with</i>
<i>exposure to asbestos,</i>

328
00:18:13,671 --> 00:18:15,365
<i>a known human carcinogen.</i>

329
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:17,694
<i>Long-term inhalation</i>
<i>of asbestos fibers</i>

330
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:19,357
<i>can cause serious</i>
<i>or fatal illnesses</i>

331
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,282
<i>including malignant lung cancer,
mesothelioma and asbestosis.</i>

332
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:27,872
I remember they worked real
hard to get that just right.

333
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,469
To get what just right?

334
00:18:29,471 --> 00:18:31,731
Oh, the swirl.

335
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:35,656
They wanted it kind of nebulous,
but not too nebulous.

336
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,219
Then there was
the issue of the speed.

337
00:18:37,221 --> 00:18:41,178
I remember there were a lot
of meetings about that.

338
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,043
I'll bet.

339
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:47,465
<i>For your free consultation, call
Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.</i>

340
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:51,456
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

341
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,344
Cliff signed off on this?

342
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:59,972
The partners were very happy.

343
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,301
What do you think?

344
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:03,398
I think...

345
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,057
Whatever happened
to showmanship?

346
00:19:11,085 --> 00:19:13,311
Yo. Check it out.

347
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,640
Ricola!

348
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:16,804
Ricola!

349
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:17,336
Hey!

350
00:19:17,338 --> 00:19:19,731
Would you two ass-clowns
act like the professionals

351
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,126
your parents are
paying for you to become?

352
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:25,718
This happens to
be very valuable.

353
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,847
Yeah?
What is it?

354
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:30,509
This one is
the Alpine Shepherd Boy.

355
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:32,005
It's for her nephew.
So, come on.

356
00:19:32,007 --> 00:19:36,297
Join me. Production meeting.
Bring it in. All right.

357
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,124
Now look, teamwork
makes the dream work.

358
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:42,716
Together, we can make something,
dare I say it, bravura.

359
00:19:42,718 --> 00:19:45,710
And this is a golden opportunity,
especially for you guys,

360
00:19:45,712 --> 00:19:47,373
'cause it's gonna play
all around the Southwest.

361
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,236
So, who knows what
it could lead to?

362
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,298
Better lead
to 100 bucks each.

363
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,729
What is it with you
and money?

364
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:53,461
Saving up for a VX2000.

365
00:19:53,463 --> 00:19:58,217
Hey! Pop quiz. What do we three
have in common with the greats?

366
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:02,209
Welles, Fellini, Bergman.
The biggies.

367
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:02,875
What?

368
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:06,500
All three of them, to a man,
worked in the highly lucrative,

369
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:09,594
creatively rewarding field,
of advertising.

370
00:20:09,596 --> 00:20:11,755
And tonight, we join them.

371
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:13,984
This is heady stuff, right?

372
00:20:13,986 --> 00:20:16,579
Okay. So, pay attention.

373
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:20,071
We open on granny,
and she is rocking.

374
00:20:20,073 --> 00:20:22,833
So she's back and forth...

375
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:25,793
Just very back and forth.

376
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:32,678
And then, very slowly and
smoothly, the camera, uh...

377
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,572
Moves towards...
Dolly?

378
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:37,635
A dolly. Good, yeah.

379
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:38,666
You see a dolly here?

380
00:20:38,668 --> 00:20:40,595
You guys
didn't bring a dolly?

381
00:20:40,597 --> 00:20:42,325
Nope. No dolly.

382
00:20:42,327 --> 00:20:43,589
You didn't ask for a dolly.

383
00:20:43,591 --> 00:20:45,186
Gotta ask, dude.
Dolly's extra.

384
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:46,383
It's true.

385
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:49,710
Okay. No dolly. Um.

386
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,703
We will improvise then.

387
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:53,468
Stay with me.

388
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,862
She's rocking,
she's shivering,

389
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:03,414
she's clutching at
a tattered shawl.

390
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:08,270
They turned the heat off on
her, these evil bastards.

391
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,597
She's cold and hungry,
she's friendless.

392
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,688
This is
heart-rending stuff, man.

393
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:20,944
Okay. It's a one-er. And it's
shot in glorious black and white.

394
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,474
We can do that, right?

395
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:23,971
Yeah.

396
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:29,560
So, that's it? Old lady in a chair?
That's your commercial?

397
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,053
Does anybody like you?

398
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,341
I'm ready for my close-up,
Mr. McGill!

399
00:22:17,728 --> 00:22:20,587
<i>It wasn't exactly set because
Perez wasn't back up in time.</i>

400
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:25,177
<i>Low ball. Strike one out right now.
Dale Carey at the plate.</i>

401
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,006
<i>Perez at first base.</i>

402
00:22:27,008 --> 00:22:30,300
<i>3-2.</i>
<i>Bottom of the ninth inning.</i>

403
00:22:30,302 --> 00:22:33,160
<i>And the pitch.</i>
<i>Perez is going...</i>

404
00:22:33,162 --> 00:22:36,519
<i>And it's over left,</i>
<i>third baseman Nick Johnson.</i>

405
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,715
<i>Perez goes into third,</i>
<i>he slides, safe!</i>

406
00:22:38,717 --> 00:22:41,310
<i>Perez gets all</i>
<i>the way around the bases.</i>

407
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:44,370
<i>Perez to third base.</i>
<i>Dale Carey still at first.</i>

408
00:22:44,372 --> 00:22:49,858
<i>Looking to get to second. But he'll
stay at first. A great play.</i>

409
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:29,550
Morning.

410
00:24:57,327 --> 00:25:00,219
Hey, honey,
what's happening?

411
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:02,148
What's wrong?

412
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:04,910
What happened?

413
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,745
Where's Kaylee?
She's at school.

414
00:25:19,747 --> 00:25:21,675
She's fine,
she doesn't know about it.

415
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:23,104
Are you all right?

416
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,500
Let me show you.

417
00:25:27,265 --> 00:25:29,890
It's up,
it's up there.

418
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:33,416
You see it?
It's right up there.

419
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,341
You see that?
You see the shape of it?

420
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,969
You do see it, right?

421
00:25:39,971 --> 00:25:41,733
I see it.

422
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,727
What time did
you hear the shots?

423
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:47,420
2:13 this morning.
I looked at the clock.

424
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:50,381
It was three of them,
It was exactly like last time.

425
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,111
And you didn't call
the police? Or did you?

426
00:25:52,113 --> 00:25:55,072
No. I...
What's the point?

427
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,029
Um...

428
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:02,090
I'm thinking
outside the box, but...

429
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:05,915
Do you think maybe it's
possible that you dreamed it?

430
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:06,681
It happens sometimes.

431
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:12,002
I didn't dream it, Mike, because I
didn't sleep a wink last night.

432
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:12,900
That came from a bullet.

433
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,697
I mean,
it must have, it wasn't there

434
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,593
before last night,
I promise you that.

435
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,090
And I,
I don't know what to...

436
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:19,720
Okay.

437
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,184
Okay.

438
00:26:21,186 --> 00:26:22,946
Jesus.

439
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:26,706
I mean, I was here.
I was here and you weren't.

440
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:28,901
I believe you.

441
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:32,726
I believe you.

442
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,815
All right.

443
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:43,104
That's it. We're getting you
and Kaylee out of this house.

444
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:45,067
End of story.

445
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,818
You ever wonder
about these things?

446
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,515
What things?

447
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:12,177
This. Like,
what's the story with these?

448
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,834
Who was it who first said, "Hey,
I know, a big bowl of balls!"

449
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:20,160
I don't know.
They came with the place.

450
00:27:20,228 --> 00:27:20,825
No shit.

451
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:23,354
They're in every corporate
apartment in the world.

452
00:27:23,356 --> 00:27:24,585
They're like the
Gideon Bible.

453
00:27:24,587 --> 00:27:28,742
Hey. Don't be jealous of my big
bowl of balls. It's unbecoming.

454
00:27:28,744 --> 00:27:31,469
Why do they all have
to have empty vases?

455
00:27:31,471 --> 00:27:35,361
Well, it's the law.
Plus, it's a metaphor.

456
00:27:35,729 --> 00:27:39,586
I gotta say, I will miss the
nail salon's vibrating chairs.

457
00:27:39,588 --> 00:27:43,079
For you, I can make any chair
in this place vibrate.

458
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:45,674
You ready for this?

459
00:27:47,172 --> 00:27:48,667
Okay, here it goes.

460
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,531
You're 86 years old,
you're a resident

461
00:27:50,533 --> 00:27:52,193
of Sandpiper,
Colorado Springs.

462
00:27:52,195 --> 00:27:55,819
You just finished your
afternoon snack, lime Jell-O.

463
00:27:55,821 --> 00:27:56,451
Lime. Got it.

464
00:27:56,453 --> 00:27:59,345
You're in the day room, you're
watching your favorite TV program.

465
00:27:59,347 --> 00:28:03,237
And what's this? There's been
another murder in Cabot Cove?

466
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:03,835
No!
Yes!

467
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:05,166
The sheriff is
in over his head.

468
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:07,961
And once again, Jessica Fletcher
has to put aside the novel

469
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:10,522
she's been writing,
and assist law enforcement.

470
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:14,447
Shocker! The killer
left behind a cryptogram.

471
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:16,509
And commercial.

472
00:28:24,594 --> 00:28:29,017
<i>My husband and I
scrimped and saved for so many years.</i>

473
00:28:29,019 --> 00:28:31,012
<i>We did our best to</i>
<i>build a nest egg,</i>

474
00:28:31,014 --> 00:28:33,840
<i>so that we wouldn't be</i>
<i>a burden to our family.</i>

475
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:38,862
<i>After Ronald passed, I moved to
an assisted living facility.</i>

476
00:28:38,864 --> 00:28:39,461
<i>A nice place.</i>

477
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:42,522
<i>They told me they'd take
care of everything. But...</i>

478
00:28:42,524 --> 00:28:46,114
<i>Then one day, they said
all my money was gone.</i>

479
00:28:46,116 --> 00:28:51,503
<i>How could that be?</i>
<i>Where did it all go?</i>

480
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:53,565
That's not
a real tear is it?

481
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:54,164
It's Visine.

482
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,727
<i>If you or a
loved one is a resident</i>

483
00:28:55,729 --> 00:28:56,858
<i>of a Sandpiper</i>
<i>Crossing facility</i>

484
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,084
<i>or other associated retirement
community, you may be eligible</i>

485
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,979
<i>to receive compensation.</i>
<i>For a free consultation,</i>

486
00:29:02,981 --> 00:29:08,999
<i>call the law offices of</i>
<i>Davis & Main at 505-242-7700.</i>

487
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:13,324
<i>That's 505-242-7700.</i>

488
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:18,213
Well?

489
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,575
You made that?

490
00:29:20,577 --> 00:29:22,604
With some film students?

491
00:29:22,606 --> 00:29:24,068
I directed.

492
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,561
It looks professional.

493
00:29:28,794 --> 00:29:29,190
And?

494
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:33,249
And if I were an 86-year-old
Sandpiper resident,

495
00:29:34,115 --> 00:29:35,111
I'd be dialing.

496
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,307
Yes! Up top.

497
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,434
And all made in accordance
with the rules and regulations

498
00:29:40,436 --> 00:29:43,926
of the American
Bar Association.

499
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:45,456
Good.

500
00:29:48,752 --> 00:29:53,473
I can 't believe
Davis & Main went for it.

501
00:29:53,807 --> 00:29:55,702
Well, I'm in charge
of the department.

502
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,132
Yeah,
but still you know...

503
00:29:57,134 --> 00:30:00,492
Cliff Main was fine with this.

504
00:30:00,494 --> 00:30:02,654
Why wouldn't he be?

505
00:30:02,656 --> 00:30:05,215
No, it's...
No, It's fantastic!

506
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:08,674
Let's celebrate. I'm getting more wine.
You want some?

507
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,637
Absolutely.

508
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,944
Colorado Springs, Colorado.

509
00:31:26,946 --> 00:31:32,068
Yeah, I'd like the number
for KKTV Channel 11.

510
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:34,761
Omar!
What's the cut-off for FedEx?

511
00:31:34,763 --> 00:31:37,822
I need to get a package
out <i>tout de suite.</i>

512
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:38,155
Oh.

513
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:42,379
Uh, yes, can you connect me
to your ad sales department?

514
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:43,576
Thanks.

515
00:31:43,578 --> 00:31:46,736
Gums look good.
No recession.

516
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,599
Tongue looks good, too.

517
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:49,730
Eyes are clear.

518
00:31:49,732 --> 00:31:51,427
This little
lady's in fine fettle.

519
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,055
I could have one of the girls
trim her nails, if you like.

520
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:56,150
No. Some other time.

521
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,843
What do you got for me?

522
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:03,036
Bodyguard job. 200 bucks.

523
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,699
What else?

524
00:32:04,701 --> 00:32:07,926
For you,
that's the best fit I've got.

525
00:32:10,755 --> 00:32:16,208
I know a loan shark, always
needs enforcement and recovery.

526
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:18,669
Pays good
and it's steady work.

527
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:21,830
Most of the time, we're
just talking intimidation.

528
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:23,260
Strictly verbal.

529
00:32:23,262 --> 00:32:25,122
"Most of the time."

530
00:32:25,124 --> 00:32:28,317
I'm not breaking legs.
What else?

531
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,106
Look, we discussed this.

532
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:36,433
You want next-level pay,
you gotta do next-level work.

533
00:32:36,435 --> 00:32:38,461
I respect where you're
coming from on this thing,

534
00:32:38,463 --> 00:32:42,087
I do.
But that's just how it goes.

535
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:48,607
All right.

536
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:50,670
She's gonna need a DHPP shot.

537
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:54,894
In six months. We'll send
you a reminder card.

538
00:32:54,896 --> 00:32:56,724
Until then.

539
00:32:57,391 --> 00:32:59,451
Give me the bodyguard job.

540
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,711
For 200?

541
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:07,734
I'll call you with
the where and the when.

542
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,821
So everybody knows to...

543
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,386
They know.

544
00:33:46,388 --> 00:33:50,045
Every line starting with 7700 has
been re-routed to the bullpen.

545
00:33:50,047 --> 00:33:51,043
Plus your office.

546
00:33:51,045 --> 00:33:52,473
All the assistants
know to keep them open.

547
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:55,268
So if you're on a call
and another call comes in,

548
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,831
the call doesn't go to
an answering machine, right?

549
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:00,158
Because, very important, old people
don't like talking to robots.

550
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,519
If I'm on a call and
another call comes in,

551
00:34:02,521 --> 00:34:03,384
they'll roll over to Maida.

552
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:07,708
After that, Iris will get the
next one, and then Julian,

553
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,139
and then Barbara and Yvon.

554
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,434
Yeah.
Right on down the line.

555
00:34:11,436 --> 00:34:11,999
Good.

556
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:14,793
Let's make that the plan,
then.

557
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:17,655
Oh, so...

558
00:34:18,055 --> 00:34:18,919
What time do you have?

559
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:23,176
Uh, quarter after. It should
be running now, right?

560
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:28,831
Is there anything else?

561
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:30,993
No, thanks.

562
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,353
It's...
I'll just be in my office.

563
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:42,302
Come on.

564
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:58,269
Come on.

565
00:34:58,937 --> 00:35:01,163
Come on, Colorado Springs...

566
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,927
Come on.

567
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:25,080
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.
Attorneys at law.

568
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:26,277
How may we help you?

569
00:35:26,279 --> 00:35:29,704
Yes, ma'am. Yes,
ma'am, that is unfortunate.

570
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,799
Now, to get your case started,

571
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:33,529
may I ask for a name
and a number

572
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,594
for one of our
attorneys to reach you?

573
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:36,490
Good afternoon, Davis
& Main, attorneys at law.

574
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:37,687
How may we help you?

575
00:35:37,689 --> 00:35:39,882
Good afternoon, Davis
& Main, attorneys at law.

576
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:41,313
Yes, sir. That is correct.

577
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:42,876
Good afternoon, Davis & Main.

578
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:43,608
One of our attorneys...

579
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,005
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main...

580
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,768
...one of our
attorneys get back to you.

581
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,534
Give me one second,

582
00:35:47,536 --> 00:35:49,562
- I'm just going to take down...
- Yes. That is correct...

583
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,660
And you're
currently a resident

584
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:52,024
at the Colorado
Springs facility?

585
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,786
Good afternoon,
Davis & Main...

586
00:35:53,788 --> 00:35:54,385
Yes, ma'am.

587
00:35:54,387 --> 00:35:57,146
We'll be happy to send an information
packet right out to you.

588
00:35:57,148 --> 00:35:59,142
May I ask,
are you currently a resident

589
00:35:59,144 --> 00:36:00,838
of the Sandpiper
Crossing facility?

590
00:36:06,462 --> 00:36:08,490
Bingo.

591
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:13,246
I'll just need
a name and a phone number.

592
00:36:51,468 --> 00:36:51,965
Yeah?

593
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:57,187
<i>Something came in this evening
and it's definitely next level pay.</i>

594
00:36:57,189 --> 00:36:57,754
Yeah?

595
00:36:57,756 --> 00:37:01,213
<i>It's probably a long
shot given your selectivity.</i>

596
00:37:01,847 --> 00:37:03,209
<i>What's the job?</i>

597
00:37:03,211 --> 00:37:05,270
I asked,
the guy wouldn't tell me.

598
00:37:05,272 --> 00:37:09,428
But whatever it is,
it's serious money.

599
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,292
And the guy,

600
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:14,751
he specifically asked for you.

601
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,944
And who's the guy?

602
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:19,175
<i>I can't hold it, sir.</i>

603
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:22,934
<i>No control on the planes, Captain.
We're going down and fast.</i>

604
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,564
"We're going down and fast."

605
00:37:24,566 --> 00:37:26,726
Check this out,
this is a good part.

606
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:27,923
So do they all die?

607
00:37:27,925 --> 00:37:30,817
Tell me that much.
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

608
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:34,410
Does Rock Hudson run
'em into an iceberg?

609
00:37:35,576 --> 00:37:39,766
Is this before or after
he did <i>McMillan & Wife?</i>

610
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:42,227
Shut up. Watch the movie.

611
00:37:44,989 --> 00:37:46,817
What is this weird
fascination you have

612
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:50,310
with stories of men trapped
on the North Pole?

613
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:52,538
<i>Ice Station Zebra</i>
is on the North Pole.

614
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,035
<i>The Thing</i> takes
place on the South Pole.

615
00:37:54,037 --> 00:37:57,029
They literally could not
be any more different.

616
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,458
My Dad loves this one.

617
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:01,952
Yeah, him and Howard Hughes.

618
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:04,214
I know, right?

619
00:38:04,216 --> 00:38:06,110
Can't get two finer
reviews than that.

620
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:08,272
<i>How much pressure
left in the air banks?</i>

621
00:38:08,274 --> 00:38:10,534
<i>Down to 800 pounds, sir.</i>

622
00:38:10,536 --> 00:38:12,796
<i>Secure after group blow.</i>

623
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,748
Mmm-mmm.

624
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,046
It's the boss.

625
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,176
At this hour?

626
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:22,776
Yeah.

627
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:26,967
Well, it's never too
late for congratulations.

628
00:38:28,566 --> 00:38:31,823
Cliff! Jesus,
you're still at the office?

629
00:38:31,825 --> 00:38:32,987
<i>You ran a commercial?</i>

630
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:37,744
Yeah. And, oh, my God, let me tell
you, the response has been...

631
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,706
You ran a commercial without
ever showing it to me?

632
00:38:39,708 --> 00:38:41,935
Without first consulting
me and my partners?

633
00:38:41,937 --> 00:38:43,998
Did you actually think
that was going to fly?

634
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,457
<i>I was planning on</i>
<i>telling you in the morning.</i>

635
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,122
The day after it aired!

636
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:51,748
I only ran it once.
Just in one small market.

637
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,711
It was kind of an experiment,
all right

638
00:38:53,713 --> 00:38:56,571
kind of under the radar.

639
00:38:56,573 --> 00:38:57,370
And in all fairness,

640
00:38:57,372 --> 00:39:00,430
you did tell me client
outreach was my department.

641
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:01,295
<i>Don't be disingenuous.</i>

642
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:05,652
This commercial, I take it
my firm's name is mentioned?

643
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:09,046
Yes. Yeah.

644
00:39:09,048 --> 00:39:09,611
Jesus.

645
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,241
Howard said you were
a little eccentric.

646
00:39:11,243 --> 00:39:14,501
He didn't tell me you were
a goddamn arsonist!

647
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,991
Cliff, to be fair,
I don't think...

648
00:39:18,993 --> 00:39:19,423
Uh...

649
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:23,748
I apologize if there was any misreading
of the situation on my part.

650
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:26,010
But there's a very
positive headline here.

651
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:29,170
We got 103 phone calls today.

652
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:31,033
Off a measly $700 ad buy!

653
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,327
Now, that kind of return on
investment, you can't...

654
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,654
Tomorrow morning. 8:00.
My office, with the partners.

655
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:37,652
And we want
to see this thing.

656
00:39:37,654 --> 00:39:41,145
Cliff, when you see this,
I know you'll...

657
00:39:46,403 --> 00:39:48,230
Yeah, Cliff.

658
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:52,987
Thank you. Yeah, you too.

659
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:55,249
Okay. See ya.

660
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,842
Golden Boy.

661
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,535
That's me.

662
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:09,020
So, what'd I miss?
Anything blow up yet?

663
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:15,049
Feeling cautious?

664
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:20,271
You going to tell me
what we're doing here?

665
00:41:21,071 --> 00:41:22,533
I've got a problem.

666
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:24,762
Okay.
This problem,

667
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:26,325
I can't solve it myself.

668
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:30,882
This problem,
is it a who or a what?

669
00:41:33,246 --> 00:41:35,672
There's a guy.

670
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:39,830
I need him to go away.
