00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,589
Kids, in late 2012, <i>I received</i>
<i>a very important text message.</i>

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,037
<i>Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin</i>
<i>were engaged,</i>

3
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:16,355
<i>marking a truly happy time</i>
<i>for our little group.</i>

4
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:20,145
<i>The problem was</i>

5
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:23,732
<i>one of us was</i>
<i>definitely not happy.</i>

6
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:27,436
Marvin will not
stop crying.

7
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:28,437
What do you guys think it is?

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,804
Is he hungry?

9
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,241
Well, that must be it.

10
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:33,275
Huh!

11
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:35,527
Thank you for thinking
of that, Ted.

12
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:37,412
And here we were
just watering him

13
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:39,364
and facing him
towards the sunlight.

14
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:42,868
Sorry, I haven't slept in...

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,036
January.

16
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:45,220
Food going in

17
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:46,488
isn't the problem,

18
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,874
it's what's coming out,
or not coming out.

19
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,992
He hasn't pooped
in three days.

20
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,044
Yeah, normally

21
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:53,862
I wouldn't wish one
of his dirty diapers

22
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:57,182
on my worst enemy,
but now I kind of miss

23
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:59,101
popping the hood
in the morning

24
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,436
and finding that first
big juicy, black...

25
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:04,239
Lily, I'm eating chili.

26
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:06,174
I'm eating chili, Lily.

27
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:08,110
Confetti.

28
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:09,645
Big blast of confetti.

29
00:01:09,647 --> 00:01:12,114
Normally, the kid's
a confetti machine.

30
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:13,782
He's Rip Taylor
in a diaper.

31
00:01:13,784 --> 00:01:15,000
I have a feeling

32
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,235
at this point, Rip Taylor

33
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:17,736
is Rip Taylor in a diaper.

34
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:19,648
And with that image,
dinner is done.

35
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:20,472
Hey, guys.

36
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,706
Hey.
Well, well, well.

37
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,542
Here comes the bride.

38
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,028
Now the annoying part, right?

39
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,546
Planning the wedding?

40
00:01:27,548 --> 00:01:29,632
So not fun, right?

41
00:01:29,634 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know-- I'm kind of
looking forward to it.

42
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:32,701
Fine, I'll do it for you.

43
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:35,037
First thing we need
to do is set a date.

44
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,555
May 25, 2013.

45
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:37,556
Thank you, Ted.

46
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:38,874
The ladies are talking.

47
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:40,309
Actually, that is the date.

48
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,679
Ted offered to help
with the planning a little.

49
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,015
And, well, uh...

50
00:01:46,017 --> 00:01:47,266
That's a big binder.

51
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,417
Oh, this?

52
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,186
This is just cakes.

53
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:52,404
Anyway, we're having
the ceremony

54
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,490
at that beautiful little
church out on Long Island,

55
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:56,759
where Victoria almost got
married-- lovely spot.

56
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,361
And then we're gonna have a
reception in a big white tent

57
00:01:59,363 --> 00:02:01,030
on the front lawn
of the hotel.

58
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,616
Oh, and, uh, the
colors are cream

59
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,301
and lilac.

60
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,704
I will cut you, bitch.

61
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:09,955
No, L-L-Lily...

62
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Original Air Date on January 14, 2013

63
00:02:14,005 --> 00:02:19,005

64
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:25,135
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

65
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,970
I'm cool, I'm cool.

66
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:27,971
Hey, Robin, where's Barney?

67
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:31,191
Did he skip town already?

68
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,609
If so, exactly
what time was it?

69
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,195
It's important
for the over/under.

70
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,982
Barney's fine, it's just...
well, earlier this morning...

71
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:42,219
So, it's been three days
since I said yes.

72
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,236
True.

73
00:02:43,238 --> 00:02:44,404
And your panic
attacks are getting

74
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:45,739
shorter and further apart.

75
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:49,743
I can't do this!
I feel like I'm drowning!

76
00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:51,712
Also true.

77
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:53,446
So I guess we're
officially engaged.

78
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:55,248
Maybe we should
tell our parents.

79
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,167
I assume my dad already knows--
you did call him

80
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,135
and got his permission, right?

81
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,087
Yeah, yeah, Robin.

82
00:03:00,089 --> 00:03:03,223
I bought you with an ox
and some spices from the East.

83
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,291
Uh, he's gonna put
you in a cage.

84
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,979
and send you on horseback
to my remote desert camp.

85
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,931
Okay, Barney...
Hold on, I'm not done.

86
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:13,767
Where you'll be bathed
in perfumes and oils

87
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,335
and delivered to my tent.

88
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:16,903
After you perform
the traditional

89
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,139
Dance of the Seven Veils,
we'll adjourn

90
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:20,907
to the tiger skin
rug where we'll...

91
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,576
Barney...
Robin!

92
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,695
If we're gonna build
a marriage together,

93
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,748
we have got to stop interrupting
each other all the time.

94
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,383
Fine, finish your story.

95
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:30,367
Thank you.

96
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,539
Where we'll do it.

97
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,623
Did you ask
for my father's permission?

98
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,874
No, I did not.

99
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:41,178
So, as some of you know,
my dad is a little scary.

100
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,182
A little? Dude's a
stone cold Slytherin.

101
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:46,883
He always looks like he
just came from slapping

102
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,519
some guy tied to a
chair in a back room.

103
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,354
Anyway, we go get lunch...

104
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,306
Look, I know I already
told you this,

105
00:03:53,308 --> 00:03:56,176
but my dad is a scary guy.

106
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,012
Please, I think
I can handle...

107
00:04:00,231 --> 00:04:02,282
Oh, vampire in the daylight,
vampire in the daylight!

108
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,734
Oh, my God.

109
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,037
Hello, Robin.

110
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,022
Hello, sir.

111
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:10,373
Put that thing away,

112
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,992
Give your old man a hug.

113
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:17,447
And then it got
really scary.

114
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:18,965
I'm glad you could
meet me here

115
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,134
at my favorite
restaurant.

116
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,587
Carol and I come
here all the time.

117
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,839
I... you...

118
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:28,141
When... Da...
who's Carol?

119
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,826
Oh, right,
you haven't met Carol, um...

120
00:04:31,096 --> 00:04:32,379
Very special woman.

121
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:35,298
48 years old, dental
hygienist, no kids.

122
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,150
Likes Zumba.

123
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:39,936
She's the reason I moved
to New York City.

124
00:04:39,938 --> 00:04:42,489
Eight months ago.
Thanks for the call, by the way.

125
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,557
Well, I figured you knew.

126
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:46,126
It's on my Facebook page.

127
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,829
You really should respond
to my friend request.

128
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,531
I post a lot of great stuff.

129
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:52,949
Are you familiar with memes?

130
00:04:52,951 --> 00:04:55,335
There's a cat who says,

131
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,204
"I can has cheeseburger""

132
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,506
Okay, what the hell
happened to you?

133
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:04,077
Robin, I know in the past,
I have been...

134
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,962
emotionally distant.

135
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:07,047
But Carol has

136
00:05:07,049 --> 00:05:10,016
brought out a whole
new side of me.

137
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,385
I have a new outlook
on life

138
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,639
a devil-may-care insouciance
that embodies the credo,

139
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:18,692
"No shirt, no shoes,
no problem."

140
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,811
Robin...

141
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:22,112
I'm fun now.

142
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:23,763
Oh, God.

143
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,116
He's fun now?
That does not sound fun.

144
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:28,535
No child should have to see
a parent go through that.

145
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,570
Well, it probably took
some of the pressure

146
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:32,105
off the Barney of it all.

147
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,374
Sir, hi.

148
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,543
My name
is Barney Stinson.

149
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,129
This is Barney?

150
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,464
This man is blond.

151
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,099
Grown men are not blond.

152
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,201
Dad.

153
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,719
Pleased to meet you.

154
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,438
That's a very...

155
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,674
fun hair color.

156
00:05:50,676 --> 00:05:52,309
That's nothing-- when he met me,
his first words were,

157
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,643
"Nice blouse""
You were wearing a blouse.

158
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,061
It was not a blouse!

159
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,313
Oh, great.
You're all here.

160
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,797
Let's talk
about our wedding band.

161
00:05:57,799 --> 00:05:59,883
How much do you guys think
they should rock?

162
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:01,184
'Cause I vote, a million.

163
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:05,005
Yeah, yeah, I think we
already settled on a DJ, so...

164
00:06:05,007 --> 00:06:06,106
Lily,

165
00:06:06,108 --> 00:06:07,073
do you remember
the band you guys

166
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,158
almost hired
for your wedding?

167
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,526
Remember them?

168
00:06:09,528 --> 00:06:11,778
I'll call them up
and book them for you.

169
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,863
Just say the word.

170
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:15,282
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel
like we keep coming back

171
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:17,317
to this DJ thing.

172
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,251
What do you think, baby?

173
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,452
Yeah, I don't think

174
00:06:19,454 --> 00:06:21,037
anyone should book anything
right now.

175
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,956
Why not?

176
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:25,892
Well, I am going to go the room
marked "Spaghettis,"

177
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,660
which I'm hoping
is the ladies room.

178
00:06:27,662 --> 00:06:29,713
"Meatballs" has
to be men's, right?

179
00:06:29,715 --> 00:06:30,897
I don't know
what the hell

180
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:32,515
"Calamaris" is.

181
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:39,723
Um...

182
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:41,775
Sir, I-I-I...

183
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,343
Permission denied.

184
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:44,394
Ooh.

185
00:06:44,396 --> 00:06:46,863
And it turns out,
"spaghettis" are men.

186
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,783
I saw a noodle.

187
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,049
He said no?

188
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,225
Yeah, I don't know
what we're gonna do.

189
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:58,293
Relax, baby.
I got this.

190
00:06:58,295 --> 00:06:59,961
I know how to be persuasive.

191
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,180
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Uncle Barney met Robin's dad</i>

192
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:03,798
<i>for lunch</i>
<i>at the same restaurant.</i>

193
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,767
<i>This time, with a plan.</i>

194
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:07,569
Hello,
Mr. Scherbatsky.

195
00:07:07,571 --> 00:07:10,605
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

196
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,575
You have my attention.

197
00:07:13,577 --> 00:07:14,943
I left the meatball at home

198
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:17,062
so I could talk to you
spaghetti to spaghetti.

199
00:07:17,064 --> 00:07:18,380
Sir...

200
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:20,932
I'm very serious
about marrying your daughter.

201
00:07:20,934 --> 00:07:26,020
Barney, when I wanted
to marry Robin's mother,

202
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:28,540
I slaughtered
a whole family of bears

203
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:29,991
with my bare hands.

204
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,192
I gave

205
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:34,045
the pelts and the bear meat

206
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,548
to her father as tribute.

207
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,751
You know what we call that
in Canada?

208
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:41,035
Manners.

209
00:07:41,037 --> 00:07:42,036
Would either

210
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,338
of you like a mudslide?

211
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,806
I just had one.
Thank you.

212
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:45,974
I'll have

213
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:49,728
a Jazzy Pizzazzy
Razzleberry Rainbow Milkshake

214
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,763
with a swirly straw?

215
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:54,132
You didn't say the magic word.

216
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,519
I'll go get your drink.

217
00:07:58,805 --> 00:07:59,854
Still crying, huh?

218
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,823
Yeah. We've tried
everything short

219
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:04,492
of a pack of smokes
and a cup of coffee.

220
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,444
Still nothing but clean dipeys.

221
00:08:06,446 --> 00:08:08,280
There's only one
explanation for this.

222
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:09,230
Marvin

223
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:10,532
has potty-trained himself.

224
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,500
He sneaks into the bathroom
while we're sleeping.

225
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,119
I'll ask Barney
to check the tapes.

226
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,371
Barney has cameras
in our bathroom?!

227
00:08:16,373 --> 00:08:18,673
Well, I mean, don't you think?

228
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,959
Hey, guys.
Robin, good.

229
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,761
You're here. Bad news.

230
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:25,797
That wedding band you wanted
is booked for May 25.

231
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,383
Oh, no. What are you gonna do?

232
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,969
Oh! Oh, hey! Here's an idea.

233
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,305
Oh, God, Ted,
if you suggest a DJ...

234
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,472
Far from it.

235
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,141
I was going to suggest a band.

236
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:38,760
A band called...
Kool and the Gang.

237
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:40,195
Robin,

238
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:41,896
would you like for me

239
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:44,316
to get Kool and the Gang
to play at your wedding?

240
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:46,701
Uh... I... yeah, guess so.

241
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,653
And would it be okay
if they invited their friends,

242
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:50,956
Beyonce and-and ABBA,

243
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,106
and the Bee Gees,

244
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:53,608
and Journey,

245
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,626
and Queen?

246
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:55,877
What? You're...?
What are you say...?

247
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,245
How... how is that
even possible?

248
00:08:57,247 --> 00:08:58,546
I'll tell you how.

249
00:08:58,548 --> 00:09:00,048
You hire a DJ.

250
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,716
Wicka-wicka-wicka-burn.

251
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:03,117
Ugh!
God, this is, like,

252
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:05,720
the fifteenth time my dad
has sent me a friend request.

253
00:09:05,722 --> 00:09:07,339
I'm just gonna hit "accept."

254
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:08,890
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, don't do it, Robin.

255
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,843
You don't want to see
what's behind that door.

256
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,011
What are you talking about?

257
00:09:13,013 --> 00:09:14,396
He's talking about

258
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:18,299
my mom's 2,000-word review
of <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i>

259
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,569
And 14 of those words
were "vulva."

260
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:24,739
You're gonna get endless
requests to play some game

261
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:27,475
that has something to do
with gangsters and farming.

262
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,527
Never mind the embarrassing
cheerleading photos

263
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:30,862
from high school.

264
00:09:30,864 --> 00:09:33,365
- Begged my mom to burn those.
- Robin,

265
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:37,452
trust me, no good can come from
accepting that friend request.

266
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:41,656
Yeah, I-I think I may have given
you guys the wrong impression.

267
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:42,624
Okay, my dad

268
00:09:42,626 --> 00:09:44,209
is actually not
that bad of a guy.

269
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:46,928
Do it, Barney.
Squeeze that trigger.

270
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,513
I don't want to do this.

271
00:09:48,515 --> 00:09:50,632
Well, you think I wanted
to kill that bear?

272
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:52,517
Yeah, kind of.
Oh, yeah, you're right.

273
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,554
I can't do this.

274
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,274
Oh.

275
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,610
What... what the hell is this?!

276
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:03,778
Your dad is crazy!

277
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,781
He wanted me
to kill Fluffernutter!

278
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,450
I told you not
to give him a name!

279
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:09,784
Well, I did!

280
00:10:09,786 --> 00:10:11,703
I gave him a name
and a backstory!

281
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,371
He comes from a magical
rabbit warren

282
00:10:13,373 --> 00:10:14,656
underneath the old
rusty tractor.

283
00:10:14,658 --> 00:10:17,042
He was the runt of the litter,
but he persevered.

284
00:10:17,044 --> 00:10:19,828
He...
Oh, give me this. Give it to me!

285
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,529
Dad,

286
00:10:21,531 --> 00:10:23,832
is there, um,
something you want to tell me?

287
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,802
Well, in the early '80s,
I did some wet work for the CIA.

288
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,704
Yes, Daddy,
I remember the bedtime stories.

289
00:10:29,706 --> 00:10:32,257
No, I'm, uh, talking
about your Facebook page?

290
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:34,225
It says you're married.

291
00:10:34,227 --> 00:10:36,144
Well...

292
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:39,180
yes, uh, Carol and I were
in Key Largo

293
00:10:39,182 --> 00:10:42,016
at a performance of the
recording artist James Buffett.

294
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,719
We're what are known
as Parrotheads.

295
00:10:44,721 --> 00:10:45,620
And, uh,

296
00:10:45,622 --> 00:10:47,722
well, one thing led

297
00:10:47,724 --> 00:10:50,942
to the other, and, uh...

298
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:52,327
we got married.

299
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,496
You didn't want
to tell me about it?

300
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:57,449
I Facebooked it...
on Facebook.

301
00:10:57,451 --> 00:10:59,084
Okay, you know what, Dad?

302
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:02,003
Since you obviously have
no interest in involving me

303
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:04,456
in your personal life,
I may as well tell you:

304
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,908
Barney and I are
already engaged.

305
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,077
That's right.

306
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,464
I'm behind you
on this, Robin.

307
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:15,082
Directly behind you.

308
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,384
Anyway, this is happening.

309
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:18,553
And since I wasn't invited
to your wedding,

310
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:20,221
you're not invited to mine.

311
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,073
Good-bye.

312
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:30,148
Oh, no!

313
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:33,964
Fluffernutter peed
all over my pants!

314
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:41,761
So, I just called up

315
00:11:41,763 --> 00:11:44,213
that wedding band's road manager
to get the number

316
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:46,416
of the people who booked them
for the 25th,

317
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,219
so I could bribe them into
giving up the band.

318
00:11:48,576 --> 00:11:51,110
You did what?!
That is so dishonest!

319
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:53,629
No matter what happens next,
I think we can all agree,

320
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,297
you're in the wrong here,
Lily.

321
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,799
It's your number, Ted.

322
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,117
All right, you got me!

323
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,736
I put a non-refundable
deposit on that band

324
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:03,089
to keep Barney and Robin
from booking them.

325
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,624
And I would've
gotten away with it

326
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,960
if it wasn't a really stupid
and expensive plan.

327
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:09,895
Dude, why would you do that?

328
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:11,814
I don't see
what the big deal is.

329
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,516
The big deal is
Robin deserves better

330
00:12:13,518 --> 00:12:15,484
than some crappy,
unreliable band!

331
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,153
Sure, bands seem cool

332
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:19,805
with their nice suits and
their well-rehearsed moves,

333
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,942
but let's be honest:
bands let you down.

334
00:12:22,944 --> 00:12:24,944
They-They cheat, they deceive,
and God knows they've slept

335
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,495
with every girl
in New York City.

336
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:28,414
I just, I can't believe

337
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,865
Robin is going through
with marrying...

338
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,785
the idea of getting a band.

339
00:12:32,787 --> 00:12:35,755
And that is, that's a perfectly
normal way to phrase that.

340
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:38,657
Okay, Ted, bar. Now.

341
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,709
Nice try.

342
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:42,378
You're gonna stick
me with that baby

343
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,463
so that you guys
can spend five minutes

344
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,798
sorting out
his love life,

345
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,967
followed by an hour
of you getting drunk

346
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,102
and pretending to be
in <i>The Departed.</i>

347
00:12:50,104 --> 00:12:52,521
You know what?
I'm sorry, Lily, okay?

348
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,806
But I just need to know:

349
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,891
Are you a cop?
I'm not a cop!

350
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:57,910
Are you a cop?
I'm not a cop!

351
00:12:57,912 --> 00:12:59,562
Uh-uh.

352
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:01,147
I got this.

353
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,514
Ted, you, me, upstairs.

354
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,449
Roof. Now.

355
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:05,017
What? It's January.
Move!

356
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:07,870
Let's cut the crap.

357
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:08,871
We're both freezing--

358
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,522
just say it
and we can go downstairs.

359
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:11,523
Say what?

360
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:12,625
Say how much you hate

361
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:14,743
that Robin and Barney
are getting married.

362
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,745
What? No. I...

363
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:17,863
I'm happy for them.

364
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:21,217
I-I encouraged Robin
to go after Barney.

365
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,869
I know-- because you thought
you were okay letting her go.

366
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,387
But now that
she's really gone,

367
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:26,872
it hurts.

368
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:29,341
Kids, at that point in my life,

369
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:32,194
<i>I'd been hurt</i>
<i>quite a few times already.</i>

370
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:35,264
Today, we're gonna braid
friendship bracelets.

371
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,387
♪ I fell in love...

372
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,524
There is a very
simple explana... ah!

373
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:47,576
This one time,
I was playing tennis, and...

374
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:50,579
Ooh!

375
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,448
Oh, ow!
Ow!

376
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,452
Hey, Schmosby, remember
when you dookied

377
00:13:56,454 --> 00:13:58,287
in your pants
down by the lake?

378
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,405
Unbelievable!

379
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,414
Do you love me?

380
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,801
No.

381
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,105
<i>But when I saw</i>
<i>that text message,</i>

382
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,307
<i>and found out Robin</i>

383
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,896
Unbelievable!

384
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:25,764
No.

385
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:28,951
<i>...times a million.</i>

386
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:31,070
I am happy for them.

387
00:14:31,072 --> 00:14:33,272
Is all you'll let yourself
say out loud,

388
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,607
because if you said anything
to the contrary, well,

389
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:36,942
that would make you

390
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,161
the most awful person
on this rooftop.

391
00:14:39,163 --> 00:14:41,664
So, I'm gonna give you an out.

392
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,415
And how are you gonna do that?

393
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:46,785
By saying something
that is even more awful.

394
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,671
Like what?

395
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,341
Sometimes I wish
I wasn't a mom.

396
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:54,843
Sometimes I want to pack a bag

397
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:58,180
and leave in the middle
of the night and not come back.

398
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,903
Robin shouldn't be with Barney,

399
00:15:03,905 --> 00:15:05,637
she should be with me.

400
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:15,497
You serious?

401
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,865
I don't know.

402
00:15:16,867 --> 00:15:19,868
I mean, I love
being a mom, and...

403
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,588
I love Marvin so much.

404
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,706
But...

405
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:24,990
but do you remember

406
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,759
when I wanted to be an artist?

407
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:28,761
Art was my whole life.

408
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,179
And-and now it's been months

409
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,514
since I've even
picked up a brush.

410
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:34,600
I-I spend the whole day

411
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:36,018
taking care of kids at my job,

412
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,103
and I come home
and it's more of the same.

413
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,688
It just...

414
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,308
It never lets up, it...

415
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:46,061
It's just really,
really hard, Ted.

416
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,182
Have you talked to Marshall
about how you feel?

417
00:15:50,184 --> 00:15:53,569
Have you talked
to Robin about how you feel?

418
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:56,155
Fair enough.

419
00:15:56,157 --> 00:15:59,875
I just think we have to accept
our lots in life,

420
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,544
and I have to be a mom to a...

421
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,546
a beautiful, wonderful--

422
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,465
if slightly constipated--

423
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,133
little boy, and...

424
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:12,721
you have to let
Robin and Barney get a band.

425
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,009
All right, let's see
what's in this dipey.

426
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:19,178
Nothing.

427
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,931
Absolutely nothing.

428
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,768
Hey.

429
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,720
Are you finally
giving Daddy a smile?

430
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,689
Oh!

431
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:31,890
Oh, God!

432
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:33,442
<i>And, no, it wasn't confetti.</i>

433
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:34,777
Oh!

434
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh, God!

435
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,899
Please!

436
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,787
Holy confetti.

437
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,790
<i>That night, Robin agreed</i>

438
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:49,458
to meet her dad one more time.

439
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,126
Your Dad has something to say.

440
00:16:55,416 --> 00:17:00,019
I'm sorry for getting married
without consulting you.

441
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,421
It was wrong of me.

442
00:17:02,423 --> 00:17:03,389
There. Now, Robin...

443
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:04,606
I know that
no mere

444
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,809
apology will fix this.

445
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,611
And that is why

446
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:11,596
I've asked Carol for a divorce.

447
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,165
What?!

448
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,150
She's heartbroken,
understandably.

449
00:17:15,152 --> 00:17:16,535
Possibly suicidal.

450
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:17,536
I did not tell him...

451
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:19,438
But if that's
the price

452
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,824
for my daughter's love...

453
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:24,660
then I will gladly
let Carol pay it.

454
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:28,780
Was that not what you wanted?

455
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:31,300
You want to know what I want?

456
00:17:32,336 --> 00:17:34,453
A normal dad. That's all.

457
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,005
I want you to give
this blond guy

458
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:38,223
permission to marry me.

459
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,142
Come to the wedding,
give me away,

460
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,961
smile in the pictures,
and then...

461
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:46,148
dance with me like a normal dad.

462
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:48,567
Is that too much to ask?

463
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,601
"Of course not.

464
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,104
"Oh, Robin, my darling girl,

465
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:53,272
"of course
I'll do all stuff.

466
00:17:53,274 --> 00:17:56,024
"I love you
and I'm proud of you."

467
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,826
He didn't say that?

468
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:58,977
No.

469
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,497
Fine. One dance--

470
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:03,315
"Cheeseburger in Paradise."

471
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,085
And Carol's going to sing it.

472
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,838
Well, see you at the wedding.

473
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,173
But it's kind of amazing.

474
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:14,726
I mean, he's never apologized
to me in his life.

475
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,496
Barney made it happen.

476
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:19,431
He must really love me.

477
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:22,434
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

478
00:18:24,053 --> 00:18:26,238
I'm really happy for you guys.

479
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:27,973
But I still think

480
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,007
you should get a DJ.

481
00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:30,943
Ju-Ju..
For God's sakes, Ted.

482
00:18:30,945 --> 00:18:32,311
Hear me out.

483
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:34,179
<i>I made a pretty strong case</i>
<i>that night,</i>

484
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>she didn't want a DJ.</i>

485
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:37,366
<i>She wanted a band.</i>

486
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,067
<i>And guess what happened.</i>

487
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,737
That's right, the band cancelled
at the last minute,

488
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,288
just like I said they would.

489
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,041
The wedding is in a week,
and no bands.

490
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,027
When will people realize
I always know what's what?

491
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:51,380
He says to the lesbian
he dated for a month.

492
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,165
That's a fair point.

493
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:54,366
Anyway, you guys

494
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,501
wouldn't, uh, happen to know

495
00:18:55,503 --> 00:18:56,885
of any good wedding bands

496
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,720
available at the last minute,
would you?

497
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:02,040
Ted, do you believe
in destiny?

498
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:03,859
You really don't know me,
do you?

499
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:06,145
We just had brunch
with my ex-roommate.

500
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:07,129
The bass player?

501
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,713
No, she's not
just a bass player.

502
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,599
She's a bass player
in the best wedding band

503
00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,817
in the tri-state area.

504
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,735
They had a gig lined up
for this weekend,

505
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,654
but it just fell through
this morning.

506
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:18,490
You, my friend, are
gonna save that wedding.

507
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,192
Do you know any DJs?

508
00:19:20,194 --> 00:19:21,243
Dude, come on.

509
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,945
Let it go, bro.
Just let it go.

510
00:19:22,947 --> 00:19:23,946
All right, all right,

511
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:24,913
all right.

512
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:26,231
Well, I guess, uh...

513
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,899
