Previously on Why Women Kill...

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:11,117
I have a date.

3
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:12,351
With your married man.

4
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:14,279
It's at this really fancy nightclub.

5
00:00:14,304 --> 00:00:15,711
He's taking you out.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,037
In public.

7
00:00:18,062 --> 00:00:19,908
I thought Rob was taking
her to the club tonight.

8
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:22,140
Do you honestly think I'm
going to let that happen?

9
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,649
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

10
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:25,826
did you happen to move any papers?

11
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,828
I know better than to touch your things.

12
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:29,773
I'll have to stay late and redo it.

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,266
<i>Would you like to come
with me to the club tonight?</i>

14
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,506
Rob canceled on me.

15
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:35,687
I love music.

16
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,975
- I used to play the piano.
- Do you still play?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,754
My husband...
didn't care for my playing.

18
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:43,170
Oh, honey. Your husband's dead.

19
00:00:43,195 --> 00:00:45,414
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

20
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,960
Honey!

21
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:51,150
Maybe when Mr. Grove moves out,

22
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:52,517
we could start doing this in your bed.

23
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:55,087
He won't be leaving
until after my daughter's wedding.

24
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:57,071
Well, it... Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25
00:00:57,096 --> 00:00:58,392
That's two months away.

26
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,844
She gave me her hand in marriage.

27
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:03,736
- Karl...
- And I'm never going to let it go.

28
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:06,321
Oh! Bloody hell!

29
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,416
I got fired.

30
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,447
I'm not surprised.

31
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,556
- Simone...
- One day, I will divorce Karl,

32
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,009
but I will never hate him.

33
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:13,291
Where does that leave me?

34
00:01:13,316 --> 00:01:14,736
In the back of a van,

35
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,110
having a marvelous time.

36
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:17,830
Van came with the job, so...

37
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:19,291
We'll figure it out.

38
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,143
I'm not worried about Duke anymore.

39
00:01:21,492 --> 00:01:22,712
He stopped texting me.

40
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:23,814
So what's his deal?

41
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,087
- Is he crazy?
- A little.

42
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:27,126
He was always accusing
me of cheating on him.

43
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,541
Come with us to Venice tomorrow.

44
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:31,376
- Oh, my God!
- Tomorrow? Really?

45
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,603
Are you going to Venice?

46
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:34,349
I don't know yet.

47
00:01:34,374 --> 00:01:36,437
I asked you, before,
if you were in love with her.

48
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:39,608
Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

49
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,878
Live with us.

50
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:41,983
Be with us.

51
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:43,826
You just got home.

00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,501
The purpose of an autopsy
is to provide clarity.

54
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,415
How did the victim die?

55
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:08,533
Was death the result of a gunshot?

56
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:11,746
Stabbing?

57
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:16,017
Poison?

58
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,822
How someone is killed
is easy to understand.

59
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:23,618
Why it happened, that's never so simple.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,298
But it always begins with a choice.

61
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,322
It might be a decision

62
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:33,806
to conduct a tawdry affair.

63
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:38,470
A plan to keep secrets from a loved one.

64
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,009
Or an agreement

65
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:45,603
to bring a stranger into your bed.

66
00:03:47,023 --> 00:03:51,854
Yes. People make all sorts
of questionable choices.

67
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,340
Of course,
that's what keeps me in business.

68
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:06,161
Our waitress is giving me odd looks.

69
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:09,168
You're wearing sunglasses
indoors, at night.

70
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:10,911
I think she recognizes me.

71
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,971
I don't even recognize you
and we've had sex ten times.

72
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,698
- Lower your voice.
- Relax.

73
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,535
Nobody here recognizes you.

74
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,890
Let me see your eyes.

75
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,041
So, I got you a present.

76
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,765
Jewelry?

77
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,284
You shouldn't have.

78
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,901
It's called a Swatch.

79
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,995
And... it's waterproof.

80
00:04:42,265 --> 00:04:45,151
Oh, so it's safe from my tears of joy.

81
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,260
I wanted to do something special.

82
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:49,920
It's our first date.

83
00:04:49,945 --> 00:04:52,862
I mean, outside of the van.

84
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:54,909
I'm not sure I'd call it a date.

85
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:55,934
Why not?

86
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,471
We're at a table, and there's food.

87
00:05:00,505 --> 00:05:02,721
I wouldn't call it food, either.

88
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:05,237
You don't make it very
easy to be your boyfriend.

89
00:05:05,262 --> 00:05:06,307
Boyfriend?

90
00:05:06,332 --> 00:05:08,105
Ah, another word you don't like.

91
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:11,541
It's just not how I would describe you.

92
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,721
What would you call me, then?

93
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,448
Your... lover?

94
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:20,621
Why do you need a job title?
What's wrong with "Tommy"?

95
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:23,402
Are you gonna put it on?

96
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:27,386
Why would I do that?

97
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,949
Because it's a gift,
and I'm asking you to.

98
00:05:29,974 --> 00:05:31,497
Oh, for God's sake.

99
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,785
What's wrong?

100
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,363
Am I embarrassing you?

101
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,019
Shh. Shush. Sit down.

102
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,855
Oh, I'm sorry.
Next time, I'll buy you a gift

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,752
that you'll actually
wear on a date with me,

104
00:05:40,777 --> 00:05:42,496
like a ski mask.

105
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,433
Tommy.

106
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,425
Uh, what did I do now?

107
00:05:51,007 --> 00:05:52,667
Can I get you anything else to eat?

108
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:56,089
Oh, God, no. The food is dreadful here.

109
00:05:56,707 --> 00:05:58,246
And he's too young for you,

110
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:00,441
while we're offering
unsolicited opinions.

111
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,941
Sheila. What can I do for you?

112
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:18,577
I have no food in my house,

113
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,285
and my kids are starting to
make some real ugly threats.

114
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,011
Maybe I can find a jar of peanut butter.

115
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,941
That's more than they deserve.

116
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:29,246
What's with the skates?

117
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:30,425
They're cute, huh?

118
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,325
Rob bought them for me
on our first date.

119
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,005
He took me to Happytime Roller Rink.

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,420
So why are you digging them up now?

121
00:06:35,444 --> 00:06:38,404
I'm going skating later
today, with April.

122
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:40,833
- The waitress?
- Oh, yes.

123
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,339
Last week, we went to
an Andy Warhol exhibit.

124
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:45,380
Next week,
she's going to teach me to surf.

125
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,122
Can you imagine? Me, surfing?

126
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:50,848
I thought the plan was
to gain the girl's trust

127
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:52,911
and convince her to end the affair.

128
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,901
That's what I'm doing.

129
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,059
You sure?

130
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,485
'Cause it sounds like
the two of you are becoming close.

131
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,298
Well, maybe a little.

132
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:03,032
April is very sweet.

133
00:07:03,057 --> 00:07:05,015
She's so free-spirited.

134
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,423
You wouldn't believe
the fun we have together.

135
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,579
Mm-hmm. She sounds nice.

136
00:07:09,604 --> 00:07:11,955
For a girl who's sleeping
with your husband.

137
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,678
I know it's odd, but I like her.

138
00:07:13,703 --> 00:07:15,055
I can't help it.

139
00:07:15,475 --> 00:07:17,782
What's wrong with her being a friend?

140
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:19,860
Nothing.

141
00:07:20,078 --> 00:07:23,081
As long as you don't forget
she's also the enemy.

142
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,540
Okay. Well, how about, uh, you know,

143
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,891
classic "she's our lover"?

144
00:07:32,916 --> 00:07:35,157
Oof. That is too sexual.

145
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:39,032
Yeah? All right.
Um, our "special friend"?

146
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:41,415
That makes me sound slow.

147
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,227
All right. Uh,
she's the third prong of our throuple.

148
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:49,165
Ugh. Barf.

149
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,790
Well, now that Jade's
gonna live with us,

150
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:52,455
we got to have some
way to introduce her.

151
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,907
Well, why don't we
just say she's family?

152
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:00,001
- Aww. I love that.
- Yeah.

153
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,743
That's nice.

154
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:05,423
Wait.

155
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:07,516
Jade, does that look like
Duke's truck to you?

156
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,688
Oh, shit.

157
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:13,469
Wait, like, like, scary ex Duke?

158
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:15,588
Did you tell him you were staying here?

159
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:17,493
No. I didn't tell anyone.

160
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:19,993
Oh, God. He's getting out the car.

161
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:21,486
- Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...
- Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

162
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,728
Okay, all right, all right. Look.

163
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,040
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

164
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,493
- I got this.
- Wait, what do you mean, you got this?

165
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:27,813
I'm gonna talk to him. You know?

166
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:30,407
- Man to man.
- No. Eli... No... don't... E...

167
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:32,610
Oh, that's not good. Okay.

168
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:35,055
Can I help you?

169
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,680
Yeah, I'm looking for my girlfriend.

170
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:38,213
A guy told me that she's staying here.

171
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,485
Oh. Uh, who's your girlfriend?

172
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,525
Jade.

173
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:43,032
Jade.

174
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,087
Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade,
Jade, Jade, Jade...

175
00:08:45,112 --> 00:08:47,305
- No... Jade who?
- She's in that window, man.

176
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:51,798
- Oh, Jade. Right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,822
- I need to talk to her.
- Oh, okay. Well, uh, the thing is,

178
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,065
she's not really
available right now, so...

179
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:56,385
- Yeah, I think she is.
- Yep.

180
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,105
Oh, shit.

181
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,618
All right, look... look, man.

182
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:02,532
I don't want to get
physical with you, okay?

183
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,329
You're right. You don't.

184
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,579
What do you think you're doing?

185
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,055
You must be the fuck buddy.

186
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,337
And you must be Duke,
the two-time felon.

187
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,508
Those were both felonies, right?

188
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:17,555
So if I were to call the
cops and they came here

189
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,118
to see you committing a third assault,

190
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,360
that sounds like three strikes to me.

191
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,649
This is the part where you walk
away to avoid going to prison.

192
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:31,423
Tell Jade I'll be in touch.

193
00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:40,477
You know, that was unnecessary.

194
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:41,923
I had it under control.

195
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,173
- Honey, it was a team effort.
- I know.

196
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,626
Thank you so much.

197
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:48,243
I was so freaked out.

198
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,196
Aww. Oh...

199
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,399
You're my hero.

200
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:53,696
Jade, I'm not your hero.

201
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:56,337
I just, I'm... want
to make sure you're okay.

202
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:06,704
Ooh, we should invite the
Prescotts to the wedding.

203
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:07,852
Must we?

204
00:10:07,877 --> 00:10:09,174
Well, I can't stand them, either,

205
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:11,524
but they spent $10,000
at the gallery last year.

206
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,438
Just put them on the maybe list.

207
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:16,165
Another maybe?
Amy will be here in an hour.

208
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,079
We promised we'd have
the guest list done.

209
00:10:18,508 --> 00:10:21,188
What about the... Randalls?

210
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,171
Absolutely not. I despise them.

211
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:24,407
Since when?

212
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:26,469
We went to their son's
wedding a month ago.

213
00:10:26,494 --> 00:10:28,782
And never got a thank you
note for the candy dish.

214
00:10:28,807 --> 00:10:30,361
- That's awfully petty.
- I agree.

215
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,415
How hard is it to write a simple note?

216
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,355
I meant you.

217
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,899
What is going on?

218
00:10:35,924 --> 00:10:37,446
What do you mean, "going on"?

219
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:40,996
You've been in a foul mood ever
since you came home last night.

220
00:10:41,629 --> 00:10:43,813
What could it be?

221
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,055
I broke a nail? No, that's not it.

222
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,641
My husband sleeps with men?
No, couldn't be that.

223
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,649
Fine. Don't tell me.

224
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:55,266
Look, we have prepaid
the caterer for 400 guests.

225
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,712
If we don't finish our list,

226
00:10:56,737 --> 00:11:00,079
then Brad's family will invite
more rubes from Oklahoma,

227
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:02,798
and the entire wedding
will turn into a hoedown.

228
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,180
Do they have hoedowns in Oklahoma?

229
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,684
Oh, well, they do in the musical.

230
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,015
First number of act two.

231
00:11:09,024 --> 00:11:11,446
How did I not know what
I was getting with you?

232
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,471
What?

233
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,274
Oh, Amy, you're early.

234
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,680
We haven't quite finished
the guest list yet.

235
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,305
Brad slept with his ex-girlfriend.

236
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,805
The wedding's off. I require wine.

237
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,125
Watch out, watch ou... watch out!

238
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,594
That was a blast.

239
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:51,964
Can I just say,
every day I spend with you

240
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:53,633
feels like an adventure.

241
00:11:54,072 --> 00:11:56,188
We do have fun together, don't we?

242
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,126
To be honest,

243
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,501
I've been feeling a
little lonely in L.A.

244
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,837
I know how you feel.

245
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:06,438
It's nice to have
a real girlfriend out here.

246
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:12,665
Well, it's getting late. I should go.

247
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,180
Wait, do you think you have time
for one more adventure tonight?

248
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,473
- I suppose.
- Okay.

249
00:12:20,062 --> 00:12:21,454
April?

250
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,090
What are you up to?

251
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,766
Go ahead. Try one.

252
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,610
Brownies? How are they an adventure?

253
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,235
My recipe calls for
a special ingredient.

254
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:36,782
Like what?

255
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:38,251
Grass.

256
00:12:39,038 --> 00:12:40,290
From your lawn?

257
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,594
No, I'm talking about pot.

258
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,149
You know, marijuana?

259
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,094
You mean reefer?

260
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:52,079
Oh. Look, it's not a big deal.

261
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,235
Lots of people do it.

262
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,360
Criminals. Musicians.

263
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:57,112
- Please don't be angry.
- You are a good girl.

264
00:12:57,136 --> 00:12:58,611
How could you do such a thing?

265
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,220
Rob wanted to.

266
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:05,962
Your married man?

267
00:13:05,987 --> 00:13:07,205
Yeah.

268
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,259
That stuns me.

269
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,095
Given how you've described him.

270
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,486
He can be such a square.

271
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:17,064
I think he was just looking
for a way to cut loose.

272
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,032
Oh.

273
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:22,743
Look, I really didn't
mean to offend you.

274
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:26,595
I'm fine. It's just something
I... wasn't expecting.

275
00:13:28,744 --> 00:13:30,587
So are we friends again?

276
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:35,025
Great. I'll go put these away.

277
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,790
- Wait.
- Hmm?

278
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,509
Oh, what the heck.

279
00:13:52,806 --> 00:13:54,212
But how did you find out?

280
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:56,126
I've had my suspicions for a while,

281
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,923
and then Brad finally admitted

282
00:13:57,948 --> 00:13:59,330
that he's been lying to me about Cindy

283
00:13:59,354 --> 00:14:01,181
the whole time we've been engaged.

284
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,025
I know so many whores named Cindy.

285
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,798
And did I mention she's fat?

286
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,392
140 pounds if she's an ounce.

287
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:09,032
Oh, 140, where did he find her,
a carnival?

288
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,689
You know, darling,
it's not even noon yet.

289
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:14,048
My fiancé fucked a beluga whale.

290
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:16,384
Can I please get some support here?

291
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,892
I'm sorry. Uh...

292
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:21,299
So he's been sleeping
with Cindy this whole time?

293
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,846
No, I didn't say that.

294
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:24,369
I'm confused.

295
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:26,666
He's been lying the whole time.

296
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:29,362
They hooked up that weekend
you took me to Hawaii.

297
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:30,667
Hang on, that was two years ago.

298
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:32,494
Were you and Brad even engaged yet?

299
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,580
No, but we were together.

300
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:36,563
Mm, off and on.

301
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:38,588
Okay, Brad hadn't proposed yet,

302
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,197
but we both knew he was going to.

303
00:14:40,222 --> 00:14:41,447
Exactly.

304
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:42,705
Yeah, or at least I knew.

305
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,541
Well, maybe you should've told him.

306
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,455
I can't believe you're
taking Brad's side.

307
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,361
I'm just saying the situation is not

308
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,080
quite so cut and dried.

309
00:14:50,105 --> 00:14:51,861
Brad is a good man.

310
00:14:51,886 --> 00:14:54,447
You might consider forgiveness.

311
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:55,830
Forgiveness?

312
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:58,525
Boy, did you marry
into the wrong family.

313
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:00,783
I'm going to my room.

314
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,416
Darling, I know you're upset,

315
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:06,275
but when you drink without
a glass, Brad wins.

316
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,470
Mmm.

317
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,121
I don't think it's working.

318
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,947
Takes a while to kick in.

319
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:20,869
I hope I recognize the sensation.

320
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,145
I'd hate to be high and miss it.

321
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,390
Trust me, you'll know.

322
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:30,080
Hey, want to order in Chinese
food and listen to records?

323
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:32,291
Aren't you having dinner with
your married man tonight?

324
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:34,840
That's tomorrow.
Tonight, Rob has plans with his wife.

325
00:15:37,357 --> 00:15:38,357
What?

326
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:39,503
I don't know.
It's been planned for weeks.

327
00:15:39,527 --> 00:15:41,166
Some dinner party with his boss.

328
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,010
Wednesday!

329
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,611
Today is Wednesday.

330
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,353
Yeah. Why?

331
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:54,528
I was supposed to feed
my neighbor's cat on Monday.

332
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,999
Oh! Poor Mittens.

333
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,545
I should go.

334
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,710
Damn it! Where's my other skate?

335
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:03,725
- It's under your armpit.
- Oh, yes.

336
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,999
Well, thank you for the reefer.

337
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:08,311
Yeah.

338
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,764
Where have you been?

339
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:34,788
We need to leave in five minutes.

340
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:36,085
I know, I know.

341
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,647
Were you roller skating?

342
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,419
Whoa.

343
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:13,936
Come on. We have to go now.

344
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,249
Let's go over a few things.

345
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:33,702
When he's out of the office,
my boss likes to be called Hal.

346
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,295
His wife is Vivian.

347
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,155
Vivian.

348
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,624
Dale and Gretchen Clark will be there.
He's tall.

349
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,522
She's brunette.
Pamela and Joe, they'll be the old ones.

350
00:17:42,547 --> 00:17:45,186
And Myron Paul is coming,
he'll be the short one.

351
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:47,475
Myron is short.

352
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,381
The guest of honor is
Mr. Tashiro from Japan.

353
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,241
Should be obvious who he is.

354
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,467
Why?

355
00:17:55,418 --> 00:17:56,913
Is that a joke?

356
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,686
Sure.

357
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,928
Duke, please,
I've apologized, like, 20 times.

358
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:16,303
What? Please, I'm begging you,

359
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:17,983
please, don't hurt her.

360
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,092
Duke! Duke, please.

361
00:18:20,117 --> 00:18:22,561
What is wrong with you?

362
00:18:22,586 --> 00:18:24,663
She's just a baby!

363
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:26,678
Duke!

364
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,381
Hello?

365
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:30,022
Oh, my God.

366
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:31,202
Jade, what's going on?

367
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:33,163
Duke is gonna kill Teacup.

368
00:18:33,991 --> 00:18:35,163
- Teacup?
- Our dog.

369
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,530
He says if I don't meet with him,

370
00:18:36,555 --> 00:18:38,131
he's gonna put her down.

371
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:39,983
Holy shit.

372
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:41,710
He can't do that, right?

373
00:18:41,735 --> 00:18:43,045
Legally?

374
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:44,686
I'm honestly not sure.

375
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,639
You don't think he'd hurt
his own dog, do you?

376
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:49,436
He went to prison for
choking his accountant.

377
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:52,053
My dad's an accountant.

378
00:18:52,078 --> 00:18:53,553
I have to go over there.

379
00:18:53,578 --> 00:18:54,983
I love that dog.

380
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,661
Jade, it's too dangerous.

381
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:58,389
I don't care. I have to save Teacup.

382
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:00,024
Fine, fine,

383
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:02,319
but you're not going alone.
I will go with you, okay?

384
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:03,350
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

385
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,803
- Thank you.
- Yes, of course.

386
00:19:05,818 --> 00:19:07,147
Whoa, whoa.

387
00:19:07,172 --> 00:19:08,608
What about me?

388
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,703
I-I'm just saying, you know, two's good,

389
00:19:11,727 --> 00:19:13,076
three's better, right?

390
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:15,514
Yeah. Okay.

391
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,237
All right.

392
00:19:35,055 --> 00:19:36,266
Oh.

393
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:38,460
If that's Brad, I'm not here.

394
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:41,772
Hello? Ah, good morning, Brad.

395
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:42,952
I'm not here!

396
00:19:42,977 --> 00:19:44,500
Yes, actually, Amy's...

397
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:46,336
Okay, yes, you heard that.

398
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:47,536
Good!

399
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:50,842
Look, I-I really couldn't say, Brad.

400
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:52,406
I mean, you know women.

401
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,087
Oh, I know. Tell me about it.

402
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:56,741
Stop talking to him.

403
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:59,281
Oh, no, if anything, worse.

404
00:19:59,813 --> 00:20:02,073
- No, I know it's ridiculous, but...
- Give me that.

405
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,667
Right, well, uh, I'm off to the gallery.

406
00:20:08,022 --> 00:20:10,597
I'd love to start the day with a kiss.

407
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,145
Mm. Ask the gardener.

408
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,761
- Oh, I won't make that mistake twice.
- Hmm.

409
00:20:37,084 --> 00:20:38,605
- Tommy!
- I was up all night,

410
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,722
thinking about our date,
and I-I was super upset,

411
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,119
but I should not have walked out,
and I am sorry.

412
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:45,215
Are you crazy? You can't come
to my house with flowers.

413
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:46,511
I waited for Karl to leave.

414
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,246
Well, he's not the only one
who could see you.

415
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,776
- You have to go now.
- But, wait, at least take the flowers.

416
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:52,573
- No!
- If you won't accept a simple gift,

417
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:53,738
then what does that
say about our future?

418
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:55,355
We have no future.

419
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,644
- Are you breaking up with me?
- Yes, it's over. Now go.

420
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,149
Tommy Harte?

421
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:01,323
Amy?

422
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:04,847
I haven't seen you since last Christmas.

423
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:07,167
Yes, it's been a while.

424
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:10,839
Hi. So who are the flowers for?

425
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:16,339
They're for you, of course.

426
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:17,730
For me?

427
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,362
How did you know I was here?

428
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,909
What a good question.

429
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:28,152
Well, I called Naomi to tell her
the wedding was off,

430
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:30,402
and she shared the bad news with Tommy,

431
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,098
and then he brought you
this lovely bouquet.

432
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:35,581
That's so sweet.

433
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,144
You're welcome.

434
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,590
Tommy, you should really go.

435
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:42,598
Amy and I have million
things to do today.

436
00:21:42,623 --> 00:21:44,519
I'll just put these in your room.

437
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:46,160
Well, it was very nice to see you, Amy.

438
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,611
Tommy, are you free tonight?

439
00:21:50,204 --> 00:21:52,723
I don't know if you're
seeing anyone these days,

440
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:55,142
but I could really use some cheering up.

441
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:02,473
Well, I was seeing someone,

442
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:05,894
but, uh, she recently broke up with me.

443
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,769
Amy! You can't go out tonight.

444
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:12,668
We have to let people
know the wedding's off.

445
00:22:12,693 --> 00:22:14,121
So there are calls to make.

446
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:15,582
I'll make them tomorrow.

447
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,855
So I'll see you at Herberto's, 7:00?

448
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,941
We can console each other.

449
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,293
That'll be nice.

450
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:25,105
Goodbye, Mrs. Grove.

451
00:22:28,568 --> 00:22:32,224
Amy, what could you
possibly be thinking?

452
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,199
Well, I'm thinking I'm going to have

453
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,301
revenge sex with Tommy Harte.

454
00:22:36,866 --> 00:22:39,402
Well, uh... you can't do that.

455
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,301
He's not even your type.

456
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,724
I know he's a little young,
but he's gotta learn from someone.

457
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,927
So you're-you're telling me
that this took four hours?

458
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:04,022
Well, yes.

459
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:05,834
- That's very impressive.
- That was the quick version.

460
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:09,122
Oh, there they are. Hey.

461
00:23:09,147 --> 00:23:11,927
We were just about to
send out a search party.

462
00:23:11,952 --> 00:23:14,419
So sorry. It takes Beth Ann
a while to get dressed.

463
00:23:14,444 --> 00:23:15,444
Yes.

464
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:16,865
So I recall.

465
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:21,341
This is my wife, Vivian.

466
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:24,872
It is so lovely to meet you, Beth Ann.

467
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:29,208
And I want to introduce you
to Gretchen and Dale Clarkson,

468
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,388
- and Pamela and Joe Kensington.
- Hi.

469
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,560
Where's Myron?

470
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,661
- Oh, Myron had to cancel
- Oh.

471
00:23:36,686 --> 00:23:37,982
Oh, here's our guest of honor.

472
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:40,333
This is the young executive
I was telling you about.

473
00:23:40,358 --> 00:23:42,279
- Robert Stanton.
- Sir, it's an honor.

474
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:44,677
I've heard a lot of wonderful
things about your work.

475
00:23:44,702 --> 00:23:46,865
I hope I live up to your expectation.

476
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,544
So Myron's not here?

477
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,490
Uh, no.

478
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:53,654
Dinner is served.

479
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,638
- Shall we?
- Thank goodness. Yes.

480
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:57,685
Thank you. I'm starving.

481
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,174
What is your name?

482
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:01,904
Beth Ann.

483
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:05,232
You must be Tashiro.

484
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:06,646
I am.

485
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,841
You were right.

486
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,060
It was obvious.

487
00:24:16,285 --> 00:24:18,021
I made place cards for everyone.

488
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:20,318
Uh, Mr. Tashiro,
you'll be right here in the center.

489
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:21,780
Thank you.

490
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:26,357
Um, Beth Ann,
did you find your place card?

491
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:29,661
Honey?

492
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:34,263
Sorry, I was looking at the swan.

493
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:35,732
Do you like it?

494
00:24:36,282 --> 00:24:39,552
It's the most amazing
thing I've ever seen.

495
00:24:39,577 --> 00:24:42,449
That is so sweet of you to notice.

496
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:43,823
Most don't.

497
00:24:44,386 --> 00:24:45,669
Rob,

498
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,294
do you see this?

499
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,404
It's very pretty.

500
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:52,997
Now put it on your lap.

501
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:55,411
Oh, I don't want to unfold it,
it took too much work.

502
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:57,443
It's fine, Beth Ann, I'm, uh...

503
00:24:57,468 --> 00:24:58,927
I'm sure it's not that difficult.

504
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,661
How would you know?

505
00:25:00,686 --> 00:25:01,849
Sweetie, don't you, uh,

506
00:25:01,874 --> 00:25:03,194
do this at all our dinner parties?

507
00:25:03,218 --> 00:25:05,169
Well, do you think that makes it easy?

508
00:25:05,194 --> 00:25:07,622
I'm sure I could do it if I tried.

509
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,786
I bet you couldn't!

510
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:13,911
That sounds like a challenge.

511
00:25:13,936 --> 00:25:15,981
No, no, she's not challenging you.

512
00:25:16,006 --> 00:25:19,201
Make a swan. I dare you.

513
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,630
Well...

514
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:23,966
She's feisty. You're on.

515
00:25:23,991 --> 00:25:26,443
Oh, well, this should
be very interesting.

516
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,074
Oh, piece of cake.
Come on. How would I begin?

517
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:30,857
I think you've got to
lay it flat to start.

518
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:32,388
Brilliant.

519
00:25:34,507 --> 00:25:36,958
The-the-the trick is in
the first fold, am-am I right?

520
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:38,654
- Well, I'm not helping you.
- Great.

521
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,115
Wait, wait, wait. Almost...

522
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Got it.

523
00:25:42,968 --> 00:25:44,091
Keep your day job.

524
00:25:44,116 --> 00:25:45,951
Not so easy, is it?

525
00:25:45,976 --> 00:25:48,185
All right, I'm gonna get it this time.

526
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,263
Honey, I dropped my fork on the floor.

527
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,463
Would you get it for me?

528
00:25:52,886 --> 00:25:54,154
Sure.

529
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:00,341
What is wrong with you? Huh?

530
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:03,234
You're acting like you're drunk.

531
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:04,474
Am I?

532
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:08,294
That might be the pot.

533
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,716
Pot?

534
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:12,208
That means marijuana.

535
00:26:12,233 --> 00:26:14,061
I had some before dinner.

536
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:16,779
Where in God's name
did you get marijuana?

537
00:26:17,503 --> 00:26:19,044
What's wrong?

538
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:21,388
Am I not allowed to cut loose?

539
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,215
We will talk about this later.

540
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Good.

541
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:30,154
Then you can tell me where
you get your marijuana.

542
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:31,818
What?

543
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:33,279
That's right.

544
00:26:34,733 --> 00:26:37,365
I know what you've been up to.

545
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:43,994
All right.

546
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,521
- It's impossible. I give up.
- Oh.

547
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:49,044
Here, here. Let me help you.

548
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,279
Thank you, my dear.

549
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:51,724
It's more like a duck.

550
00:26:58,547 --> 00:26:59,888
This is it.

551
00:26:59,913 --> 00:27:02,437
Duke's place is just down the pathway.

552
00:27:03,276 --> 00:27:04,513
Okay...

553
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,779
let's do this.

554
00:27:05,804 --> 00:27:07,857
Okay, why are you talking like that?

555
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:09,607
Like what?

556
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,366
Like the star of a
low-budget action film.

557
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:14,497
What? I'm not doing that.

558
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,478
All right, let's stay close, people.

559
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:22,872
Here we are.

560
00:27:22,897 --> 00:27:24,310
- What's the plan?
- Okay,

561
00:27:24,335 --> 00:27:25,858
so I'm gonna knock on the door.

562
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:28,076
When Duke answers, I'll confront him...

563
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:29,779
No confronting.

564
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:31,115
Duke is a violent felon.

565
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,315
Are you crazy?

566
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,122
You brought a hammer?

567
00:27:36,147 --> 00:27:38,552
I prefer to call this "Plan B."

568
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:40,560
That's your plan B, aggravated assault?

569
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,146
It's not assault if he hits me first.

570
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:44,513
Oh, he will definitely hit you first.

571
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:47,185
Great, great, anyway,

572
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,685
so while we're struggling,
Jade's gonna rush in,

573
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,581
she's gonna grab the
dog, and then we run.

574
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:53,701
Honey, that is a stupid plan.

575
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,857
That's a bit harsh,
but, okay, fine, you go.

576
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,607
Here's my plan: Duke opens the door

577
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,193
and I write him
a massive check for the dog.

578
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:02,708
Oh, that's good. Duke is always broke.

579
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:04,827
Fine. I mean,
if you want to be the kind of person

580
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,647
that just solves all of
her problems with money.

581
00:28:06,671 --> 00:28:08,146
I very much do.

582
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,732
Jade, go ahead.

583
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:15,013
Duke!

584
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:17,921
Oh, my God.

585
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:18,946
Oh, my God.

586
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:21,574
Oh, my God, it's Teacup.

587
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,849
Honey, honey, it's okay.

588
00:28:23,874 --> 00:28:25,380
Mommy's here.

589
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:27,555
I guess Duke's not home.

590
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,333
No, no, no. No, no, no.

591
00:28:29,358 --> 00:28:31,154
He's definitely, definitely home.

592
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,702
He doesn't go to work till 5:00.

593
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:37,372
Alright. Come on, Duke, open up.

594
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:41,435
Okay.

595
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,599
He's clearly not home. You know what?

596
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:46,857
We'll just write him a note
and we'll say that you came by

597
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:49,754
and you are willing to make him
a generous offer to buy the dog.

598
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:52,880
W-What, w-we're just
gonna leave her here?

599
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:55,029
For now, yeah.

600
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,390
Okay, I left my pen in the car. Hold on.

601
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,576
I don't like this.

602
00:29:02,601 --> 00:29:04,864
I know, but, I mean,
what else can we do?

603
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:06,530
You don't understand,
if something happens to my dog,

604
00:29:06,554 --> 00:29:08,560
I will fucking lose my mind.

605
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:10,990
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Please, please, please.

606
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:27,966
Start the car!

607
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:30,630
What? Oh, shit.

608
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:32,763
Start the car now.

609
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,138
Jade!

610
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:44,872
You bitch!

611
00:29:45,944 --> 00:29:47,741
You're fucking dead!

612
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,763
Mom, have you seen my car keys?

613
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:59,616
I'm gonna be late to meet Tommy.

614
00:29:59,641 --> 00:30:00,898
Sorry.

615
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,708
I could've sworn they were in my jacket.

616
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,536
What the hell?

617
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,036
I'm going on a date

618
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,841
and you're inviting
Aunt Kay to the wedding?

619
00:30:11,866 --> 00:30:13,115
That makes no sense.

620
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,404
I know she's dull, but she's
good for a gravy boat at least.

621
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,279
I'm not getting married. Okay?

622
00:30:18,304 --> 00:30:20,826
I'm going to meet Tommy Harte for sex,

623
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:22,786
if I ever find my damn keys.

624
00:30:22,986 --> 00:30:25,349
Yes, dear. If.

625
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,061
Did you hide my keys?

626
00:30:29,434 --> 00:30:32,630
Yes. And once you've calmed
down, you'll thank me. Sit.

627
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:34,701
No! Where are my keys?

628
00:30:34,726 --> 00:30:36,294
They're not in my purse.

629
00:30:39,847 --> 00:30:41,155
I told you they weren't in there.

630
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:42,958
Fine, keep the keys. I'll walk.

631
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:45,599
In those heels, you won't
make it past the driveway.

632
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,615
I know you're upset,
but if you sleep with Tommy,

633
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,310
you're slamming
the door on Brad forever.

634
00:30:50,335 --> 00:30:52,404
I know. That's the point.

635
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:54,605
But you love him, and he loves you.

636
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,544
The hall's booked,
the caterer's been paid,

637
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:57,990
your dress is gorgeous.

638
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:00,740
Why are you on Brad's side?
What's changed?

639
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,396
Who got to you?

640
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:03,810
Hello.

641
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:04,974
Was it him?

642
00:31:04,999 --> 00:31:06,896
It was you. This is all your fault.

643
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,607
Yes, I'm sure it is.
Sorry, what are we talking about?

644
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:13,419
Amy's decided to pay Brad
back by seducing Tommy Harte.

645
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:16,130
Tommy? Isn't he a little young for you?

646
00:31:16,155 --> 00:31:17,794
What is he, 17?

647
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,982
He's 18 and mature for his age.

648
00:31:22,144 --> 00:31:23,599
But that's beside the point.

649
00:31:23,624 --> 00:31:25,017
You made a promise, young lady,

650
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:27,529
to Brad, to us,
and to the Biltmore Hotel.

651
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:29,943
Oh, you're one to talk about promises.

652
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:32,419
You divorced Daddy, the guy after him,

653
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:33,826
and now with Karl sleeping

654
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,661
in the guest room, I'm assuming
he's on his way out as well.

655
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:38,310
Look.

656
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,154
I love Brad,

657
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:42,138
but I don't know if I can trust him,

658
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:44,383
and I don't want to be another you.

659
00:31:45,238 --> 00:31:47,414
With three husbands by 40.

660
00:31:54,773 --> 00:31:56,583
Your keys are in the freezer.

661
00:31:57,061 --> 00:31:58,177
Go.

662
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:01,888
A-Amy, Amy. You're right.

663
00:32:03,198 --> 00:32:06,724
Your mother and I are
sorting through some issues,

664
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:09,044
and I'm not a perfect husband,

665
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:10,786
and maybe Brad won't be either,

666
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:13,204
but love is always a risk,

667
00:32:13,547 --> 00:32:16,497
and I know it's easy to think
this is never going to last,

668
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:19,089
so why don't I end it now, but...

669
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,065
the chance for love doesn't
come around every day.

670
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,673
One must think long and hard
before one casts it aside.

671
00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:32,095
Mm. Tommy's waiting.

672
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,556
Oh, go, go. I...

673
00:32:33,581 --> 00:32:35,595
I hope you have a nice dinner.

674
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:45,016
Do you, uh...

675
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:47,587
think my pretty speech helped?

676
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:51,162
More than you know.

677
00:32:52,153 --> 00:32:53,961
I need to make a phone call.

678
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:03,000
My baby.

679
00:33:04,601 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm gonna take Teacup upstairs.
It's nice and quiet up there.

680
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,191
Yeah. She's had a stressful day.

681
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:12,215
What you did today,

682
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,840
that was the nicest thing that
anyone's ever done for me.

683
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:17,715
- Oh. No big deal.
- No. It absolutely was.

684
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,371
- Ow!
- Oh...

685
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:20,816
Son of a bitch.

686
00:33:22,028 --> 00:33:24,222
Please hide this.
Somewhere he can't find it.

687
00:33:24,247 --> 00:33:26,075
Okay. Thanks.

688
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,246
Come on, Teacup.

689
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:28,918
Oh, that's a good girl.

690
00:33:33,916 --> 00:33:35,074
It's a good day, huh?

691
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:36,448
Is it?

692
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,527
I mean, we got the dog back, didn't we?

693
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,621
All right. I know we might've
broken the law a little bit.

694
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:48,113
You broke the law, a lot.

695
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,207
And you made me an accomplice.

696
00:33:50,232 --> 00:33:52,769
All right, yeah, but you saw
how happy it made Jade, right?

697
00:33:52,794 --> 00:33:55,543
- I think it was worth it.
- Absolutely, you're right.

698
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:58,090
The smile on Jade's
face more than makes up

699
00:33:58,115 --> 00:34:00,175
for the fact that I could be disbarred.

700
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:03,550
I'm sorry.
I mean, I had to do something.

701
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,480
No, you didn't. I had a plan.

702
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,566
Yeah? So did I.

703
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:10,027
Mine actually worked.

704
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:11,105
That's not the point.

705
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,457
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The point is that I finally do

706
00:34:13,482 --> 00:34:15,481
something right and you
can't even be happy about it.

707
00:34:15,505 --> 00:34:17,519
What am I supposed to be happy about?

708
00:34:17,544 --> 00:34:20,144
For the last two years,
I've been pathetic Eli

709
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:21,957
who-who can't finish a screenplay,

710
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,129
who can't help pay the bills.
I-I get it.

711
00:34:24,154 --> 00:34:26,340
You're frustrated with me.
Well, guess what?

712
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,505
I'm frustrated with me, too.

713
00:34:28,956 --> 00:34:31,152
- Eli, you're not pathetic.
- No?

714
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:33,707
'Cause this morning,
I couldn't even defend my own home.

715
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:34,988
My wife had to come save me.

716
00:34:35,013 --> 00:34:36,700
'Cause I thought he was
gonna beat you to a pulp.

717
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:37,941
He probably would have.

718
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,652
But the fact that you had to step in,

719
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:41,505
that makes it hurt even worse.

720
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,550
- I was just trying to be helpful.
- I know.

721
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:46,957
But sometimes, honey,

722
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:48,941
I just need a fucking win.

723
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,863
Okay? I just want to feel like a man

724
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:54,630
and save a dog and have
that be good enough.

725
00:34:57,423 --> 00:34:58,598
You're right.

726
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,755
- It was a good day.
- Thank you.

727
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:06,614
I didn't lock the door.

728
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:08,958
Okay, all right. Call the police.

729
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,599
Hey. Look, hey,
man, l-let me just start

730
00:35:13,624 --> 00:35:15,114
by offering my...

731
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:17,349
No!

732
00:35:17,795 --> 00:35:19,622
Get off me, you bitch!

733
00:35:21,555 --> 00:35:22,700
Jade!

734
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,099
Jade!

735
00:35:29,342 --> 00:35:30,888
Jade!

736
00:35:33,825 --> 00:35:35,411
Where the fuck is she?

737
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:58,903
You broke my leg, you crazy bitch!

738
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:02,653
Fuck with my family again,
and I'll break the other one.

739
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:11,364
- How's your food?
- Excellent.

740
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:14,599
- Yours?
- Yeah, it's-it's really good.

741
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:15,974
Good.

742
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:19,716
So you're going to college in the fall?

743
00:36:19,741 --> 00:36:22,222
- Art school.
- Oh, that's right.

744
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,919
You like to draw.

745
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:26,165
That's cute.

746
00:36:27,177 --> 00:36:28,544
Yeah.

747
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,653
Oh, what the hell?

748
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,489
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
Hello, Tommy.

749
00:36:36,514 --> 00:36:37,544
Mrs. Grove.

750
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:38,962
What are you doing here, Mom?

751
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,620
I need a moment.

752
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:42,028
For what?

753
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,100
I brought someone.

754
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:46,552
Brad would like to talk to you.

755
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,786
I'm in the middle of dinner.

756
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:53,747
Well, Tommy doesn't mind. Do you?

757
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:55,309
No.

758
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:04,904
- Simone...
- Don't look at me.

759
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,607
People will see.

760
00:37:07,646 --> 00:37:08,786
Okay.

761
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:11,537
There's something I want to say.

762
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:14,224
Look, I only went out with
Amy to make you jealous.

763
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:18,286
It was a, it was dumb thing to do.
I was just hurt, you know?

764
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:20,997
Because I like you so much.

765
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:24,513
But I was thinking that
if we put a name to what

766
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:27,802
we've been doing, then I would know
how you felt about me,

767
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:30,161
but you're not into it, so I'll...
I will back off.

768
00:37:30,186 --> 00:37:31,884
You can look at me now.

769
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,893
I must really like you a lot
to wear this god-awful thing.

770
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:51,482
Well.

771
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:53,708
I guess the wedding's back on, then.

772
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,591
Oh. Apparently so.

773
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,302
Back to us.

774
00:37:58,646 --> 00:37:59,979
Are you free Friday?

775
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,700
Yes, ma'am.

776
00:38:01,725 --> 00:38:04,099
Don't call me ma'am.

777
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:05,966
Yes, lover.

778
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,482
Ma'am will be fine.

779
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,341
Thank you again for inviting us.
Everything was lovely.

780
00:38:17,366 --> 00:38:19,114
We are so glad you came.

781
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:21,528
I can't remember the last
time we laughed so hard.

782
00:38:21,553 --> 00:38:23,607
You're an absolute delight.

783
00:38:24,642 --> 00:38:26,905
I hope we see you again very soon.

784
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:29,302
Robert, you're a lucky man, son.

785
00:38:29,698 --> 00:38:31,005
Hope you know that.

786
00:38:32,505 --> 00:38:33,669
Yes, sir.

787
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:38,122
- Good night.
- Good night.

788
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,739
So how did you figure it out?

789
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,172
Oh, crap. I left a joint
in my pocket, didn't I?

790
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,985
You did.

791
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:13,489
You absolutely did.

792
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,974
I knew something was up.

793
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:18,724
You've been acting strangely for weeks.

794
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,456
So why did you smoke it?

795
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,403
To get back at me?

796
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:29,919
Well...

797
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,239
I don't blame you.

798
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:35,692
I'm sorry.

799
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:42,974
My walk on the wild side is over.

800
00:39:44,338 --> 00:39:45,817
Won't happen again.

801
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,060
I have one question.

802
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,085
What's that?

803
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,052
Why did you want to try marijuana?

804
00:40:08,996 --> 00:40:11,505
I thought it would be
fun to break the rules.

805
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:14,692
Does that sound... stupid?

806
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:18,311
Not at all.

807
00:40:18,487 --> 00:40:23,646
My life feels like one of
those stupid swan napkins.

808
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,888
It's rigid, it's all tight folds
and sharp edges.

809
00:40:27,913 --> 00:40:29,393
And people admire it,

810
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:33,370
but it takes so much work.

811
00:40:33,952 --> 00:40:36,253
And it's goddamned exhausting.

812
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:38,444
Course it is.

813
00:40:40,985 --> 00:40:43,987
We've forgotten to find
time in our life for joy.

814
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,385
Joy?

815
00:40:45,888 --> 00:40:48,456
Hell, I'd settle for a
few laughs now and then.

816
00:40:49,437 --> 00:40:51,401
I would love to hear you laugh again.

817
00:40:52,738 --> 00:40:54,846
I'd break every rule
in the book for that.

818
00:40:57,662 --> 00:40:58,662
I'm starting to realize

819
00:40:58,687 --> 00:41:00,823
you're not the good little
girl I thought you were.

820
00:41:02,804 --> 00:41:04,023
No, sir.

821
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,120
I'm a rebel.

822
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:10,940
Okay. Okay.

823
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:16,174
We've got to do something, tonight.

824
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:17,721
Something...

825
00:41:19,167 --> 00:41:20,534
crazy!

826
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,784
Crazy and hilarious.

827
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:25,198
But what? I mean...
what can we do? What?

828
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:28,167
I'm actually getting excited.

829
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:36,971
Rob...

830
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:45,213
We're being too loud.

831
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,807
I thought you were a rebel.

832
00:41:47,741 --> 00:41:49,096
You're right.

833
00:41:55,923 --> 00:41:58,159
If you visit your local morgue,

834
00:41:58,184 --> 00:42:00,596
you'll find the bodies of good people

835
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:03,026
who made bad choices.

836
00:42:06,174 --> 00:42:09,346
Some engaged in reckless love affairs.

837
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:15,588
Some invited violent
strangers into their home.

838
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:18,956
And some kept dark secrets

839
00:42:18,981 --> 00:42:21,878
from those they loved.

840
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:27,625
Yes, it's choices like these
that lead to death.

841
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:32,938
And more importantly, murder.

842
