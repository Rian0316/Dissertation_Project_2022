Please, God, don't let us
get pistol-whipped in here.

180
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:57,675
It's either that Guinevere
or spider-man came out.

181
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:03,680
Caroline, can I talk to you
about a private matter,

182
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:06,449
by which I mean the matter is my privates.

183
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,385
Okay, but hurry, Oleg.

184
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,286
I'm in the middle of
a dream catcher situation,

185
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:12,555
and it's a nightmare.

186
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:13,823
And why me?

187
00:08:13,825 --> 00:08:15,892
'Cause I trust and respect you

188
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:19,596
and I feel like you know
your way around a limp penis.

189
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,733
Maybe.

190
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,369
I talked to my therapist...

191
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:29,972
Roy, you know, down at the Starbucks.

192
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:31,641
He told me it's all mental.

193
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,276
We didn't get much further than that.

194
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,846
He spilled a grande
mochaccino on his sandals.

195
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:38,881
You're probably just scared.

196
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,850
Intimacy is so hard for some guys,

197
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,220
it's not hard for some guys.

198
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:47,290
Yeah, that's all over my head.

199
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,692
Oh, no, Max forgot the order slips.

200
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:52,428
Oleg, I'm sure it'll all work out.

201
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,998
Good luck getting your penne al dente.

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,168
Again, over my head.

203
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,058
Max, what are you doing?

204
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,226
What are you doing?

205
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:08,778
What am I doing?

206
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,279
Well, I think I'm watching you shove

207
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,615
our delivery bike into
the back of an uber car.

208
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:15,384
Well, this is uber-awkward.

209
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:17,720
Come on, come on. In or out.

210
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,856
All right, Caroline,
this is Milesh, with a “K.”

211
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,591
he doesn't go to the airport,

212
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:25,327
and he once drove some of Maroon 5...

213
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,264
So Maroon 3.

214
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:29,698
No, stop. Caroline.

215
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,901
If you want me to deliver the cupcakes,

216
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,236
I can't use the bike,
I have to use the car.

217
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,404
Why?

218
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:38,107
Oh, my God, are you pregnant?

219
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:43,479
You ask me that every day,
and almost every day I say no.

220
00:09:43,481 --> 00:09:46,448
Look, I want to tell you,
but it's a secret.

221
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,983
And you can't tell anybody.

222
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:50,119
Do you seriously think
I would ever tell anyone

223
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:52,454
anything about this life?

224
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:54,123
Right.

225
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:56,425
I don't know how to ride a bike, okay?

226
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,427
You don't know how to ride a bike?

227
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,330
Max doesn't know how to ride a bike?

228
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:03,465
Damn it, Caroline!

229
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:04,766
[Laughing]

230
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:06,535
Max doesn't know how to ride a bike.

231
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:07,836
Oh, happy day.

232
00:10:07,838 --> 00:10:09,738
I finally have something over her.

233
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,939
There is a God,

234
00:10:10,941 --> 00:10:13,075
and he's laughing at her too.

235
00:10:14,644 --> 00:10:16,311
Lordy, this is harder to watch

236
00:10:16,313 --> 00:10:19,882
than Jim Carrey in a drama.

237
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:22,017
[Laughing]

238
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:28,002
[Knock at door]

239
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:31,593
Max, are you up?

240
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,196
What's that smell? Did you
bring home Greek food?

241
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,964
No, that's me.

242
00:10:35,966 --> 00:10:38,967
That's how you smell after you ride a bike

243
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:42,504
all over Williamsburg delivering
14 orders of cupcakes,

244
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:44,773
and I do not wish to smell like this again,

245
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,643
so you have to learn how to
ride that bike, all right?

246
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,278
Who do you think you are busting in here

247
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,548
smelling like hummus but having no hummus?

248
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,217
What is the problem?

249
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,952
Didn't your mother ever teach
you how to ride a bike?

250
00:10:56,954 --> 00:11:00,055
No, my mother was too busy
being the town bike.

251
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,656
Well, then I'll teach you.

252
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,158
Nope. Never getting on a bike.

253
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,626
It's one of my three “nevers.”

254
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:06,127
Yes, well, your first “never” was,

255
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,463
“never having a blonde roommate.”

256
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:12,234
You are chipping away at me
piece by piece, lady.

257
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:16,304
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what's going on.

258
00:11:16,306 --> 00:11:19,407
I'd sit on your bed, but
that's your third “never.”

259
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:20,909
[sighs]

260
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:23,411
When I was little, there was
this kid, Tommy Doonan.

261
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:26,514
Nice kid, solid hopscotcher.

262
00:11:26,516 --> 00:11:28,883
Used to give me his fruit
roll-up at lunch every day.

263
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,885
Max, did he give you these fruit roll-ups,

264
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,986
or did you take them?

265
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:33,721
Don't interrupt.

266
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:36,524
One day, Tommy Doonan got a new bike.

267
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:39,427
He was out front with this nice, older man

268
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:40,929
who looked just like him.

269
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,798
You mean his dad?

270
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,767
Mm, is that what they call them?

271
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:48,536
I assumed it was a predator.

272
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:51,472
So anyway, I was making fun of him

273
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,541
'cause he seemed happy.

274
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:56,377
I thought that was our thing.

275
00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:58,980
And he started showing off,
doing wheelies and stuff,

276
00:11:58,982 --> 00:12:00,381
to put me in my place,

277
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:03,384
but then he flipped up over the handlebars

278
00:12:03,386 --> 00:12:06,454
and came down hard on his face.

279
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,755
Sad,

280
00:12:07,757 --> 00:12:11,392
but not worth me having baklava pits.

281
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,027
Well, wait.

282
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,896
After I stopped laughing

283
00:12:14,898 --> 00:12:18,566
and the man picked him up
and hugged him predator-style,

284
00:12:18,568 --> 00:12:22,937
I saw Tommy's teeth
had busted through his cheek.

285
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:24,338
To put it plainly,

286
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,409
his mouth was on the outside of his face.

287
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:31,645
Ew, that's like something
out of a horror movie,

288
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:35,416
like<i> Bike of the Living Dead</i>
or<i> Texas Bike Chain Massacre</i>

289
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,419
or... well, that's probably enough.

290
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:41,589
Every time I see a bike,
I think of his little face

291
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:45,059
and his little teeth
chomping out the side of it.

292
00:12:45,061 --> 00:12:47,027
He had to eat apples like this...

293
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,530
[Babbling]

294
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,600
Max, you are not responsible for that.

295
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:54,268
Yeah, I know,

296
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,838
and 1 out of the 12 jurors agreed.

297
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,874
Thank you, number six.

298
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:04,378
Anyway, it freaked me out, so good night.

299
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,779
No, Max.

300
00:13:05,781 --> 00:13:07,448
It is not going to work that way.

301
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,782
You're learning how to ride a bike.

302
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:10,951
I'm already on one painful cycle.

303
00:13:10,953 --> 00:13:12,753
I don't want to get on another one.

304
00:13:12,755 --> 00:13:14,988
Max, I have access to tootsie rolls,

305
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:17,925
and if you get on a bike,
I will give you four.

306
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,126
What am I, a chimp?

307

- Five.
- Let's go.

Don't look so smug, chestnut.

309
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:31,805
You don't know how to ride a bike either.

310
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,007
Come on, Max, just out here in the alley.

311
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,077
Oh, hell no!

00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:39,446
- What?
- She's been back here too.

313

- Who?
- Guine-queer.

00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:46,052
There's so much yarn-bombing,
it's like craft-ganistan.

315
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,548
Max, let it go.

316
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,922
Stay focused.

317
00:13:48,924 --> 00:13:49,890

- Nope.

to get your balance.

00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:07,099
I'm teaching Max how to ride a bike,

356
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:08,567
and it's pretty hard.

357
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:10,770
Oh, yeah, I wish I had that problem.

358
00:15:10,772 --> 00:15:13,806
I'm dancing with a rope in here.

359
00:15:13,808 --> 00:15:15,841
We're trying some exotic, new locales

360
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:17,410
for our lovemaking.

361
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:20,746
It's exotic because
this isn't even our car.

362
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:22,181
(Sophie) Oh, uh...

363
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:25,584
We better hurry before
that rabbi comes back.

364
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,420
Maybe try barking at it again.

365
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:29,788
There was some movement earlier.

366
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,323
[Sophie barking]

367
00:15:31,325 --> 00:15:33,892
Come on, Caroline, teach me
how to ride this thing.

368
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:36,462
I got to get away from Temple Gross Shalom

369
00:15:36,464 --> 00:15:38,097
as fast as possible.

370
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,665
Okay, I'm gonna get behind you

371
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,133
and hold on to your seat.

372
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:42,868
Not without three long island iced teas

373
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,304
and one, “your butt
looks good in those jeans.”

374
00:15:45,306 --> 00:15:48,807
- Tootsie?
- Yeah.

375
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:49,942
Max, don't look.

376
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:51,276
Yarn-bombing?

377
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:52,378
(Han) Hey, Max.

378
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,846
(Max) Han?

379
00:15:53,848 --> 00:15:55,547
I'm just riding my bike to the bike store

380
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,716
to buy more bikes.

381
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:59,184
Is that Han or

382
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,153
Lance Armstrong's runaway testicle?

383
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:02,754
Sorry, couldn't hear you.

384
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,857
I was too busy knowing how to ride a bike.

385
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:08,715
Damn it! Now I got to do this.

386
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,496
You know how quickly society
will crumble around us

387
00:16:11,498 --> 00:16:15,267
if Han starts feeling like
he can freely tease me?

388
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:16,702
- You sure?
- Yep.

389
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:18,236
Making fun of Han

390
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,372
is one of my two free
sources of entertainment.

391
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:22,874
The other one is located
right above this bar.

392
00:16:22,876 --> 00:16:24,843
Okay, I'll keep my Hand on the seat,

393
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:27,112
and then when you're ready,
tell me, and I'll let you go.

394
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,381
Okay, but don't let go until I say so.

395
00:16:30,683 --> 00:16:31,716
Okay, let go.

396
00:16:31,718 --> 00:16:32,918
Already did.

397
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,452
I'm riding a bike?

398
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,921
Max, look out! Pothole!

399
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:41,660
[Groaning]

400
00:16:41,662 --> 00:16:44,129
There goes my other free
source of entertainment.

401
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,797
Tootsie?

402
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:48,633
Yes, obviously!

403
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,916
[Bell rings] Table ten. Pick up, Max.

404
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,221
Yeah, be right there.

405
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:06,257
Like, you know, in a month.

406
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,759
Uh, Max, how you doing?

407
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:12,563
I heard about your vag-accident.

408
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,431
Look, if you need to see a doctor,

409
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,067
my cousin in Florida is a good one,

410
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,905
but then again, the bumpy
bus ride might kill you.

411
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:23,207
No, no, it'll be fine, Earl.

412
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,576
I'm icing it. I just have to keep it cold.

413
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,452
We're out of Ginger ale.

414
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,423
I think you mean the
Ginger ale is out of you.

415
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,925
Max, let me get that for you.

416
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,094
I feel like it was kind of my fault.

417
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,028
Kind of?

418
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,330
Was Lincoln's death

419
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:47,498
kind of John wilkes booth's fault?

420
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,465
[Bell rings]

421
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,400
Pick up, Caroline.

422
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,002
How'd it go with Sophie?

423
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,238
Were you able to do the thing,
you know, the man does

424
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,507
while the woman makes
shopping lists in her head?

425
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,209
Shh. Come on.

426
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,478
I don't want anyone to
know I can't get it up.

427
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,914
Oleg can't get it up?

428
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,116
[Laughing]

429
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,518
OMG. Oleg can't get it up.

430
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
[Laughing]

431
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,588
Best week ever.

432
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,523
Hey, everybody!

433
00:18:15,726 --> 00:18:17,093
What's up?

434
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,428
Not your boyfriend.

435
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,698
[Laughing]

436
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,899
If anyone needs me,

437
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,634
I'll be outside riding my bike

438
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,636
with an erection.

439
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:30,774
Oh, no, no, no, no.
He didn't hear it from me.

440
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,442
I only told two people...

441
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,045
Max and my manicurist, Ming Wa.

442
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,180
And you don't have to worry about her

443
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,215
because she doesn't care about anything

444
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:43,319
except loving some guy named long time.

445
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,757
Sophie, baby,

446
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,426
this is hard.

447
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,195
Yeah, maybe we better
not try to be serious.

448
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,664
I mean, the real truth is,

449
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:57,700
I only like you for your penis anyway.

450
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,703
Say that again.

451
00:19:00,705 --> 00:19:03,206
What, that I only like you for your penis?

452
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,575
One more time.

453
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,478
Well, what, that I don't have
any real feelings for you?

454
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,213
That it's completely sexual

455
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:14,317
and I only like you
for your big, stupid penis?

456
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,885
I'm back, baby.

457
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,654
Sophie, can I see you in the kitchen?

458
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:20,990
And we better hurry.
I'm making three-minute eggs.

459
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:24,527
Cancel my eggs.

460
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:30,132
I would've so left during
that whole conversation,

461
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:33,970
but I'm holding a can of
Dr. Pepper between my legs.

462
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,305
What? He's a doctor. He's seen it.

463
00:19:37,574 --> 00:19:39,408
Well, I think we're pretty much even.

464
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,278
Your legs are a little sore,
and I'll never have children.

465
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,482
So I guess what I'm saying is thanks.

466
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:49,752
So you really don't want
to get back on the bike?

467
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,253
You're just gonna give up?

468
00:19:51,255 --> 00:19:54,123
I bet even Tommy Doonan
got back on the bike.

469
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,257
Whatever happened to him?

470
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:57,326
I caught up with him on Facebook.

471
00:19:57,328 --> 00:20:00,429
Well, more like really-messed-up-face-book.

472
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:01,797
He's happily married.

473
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,966
I bet right now he's driving his car,

474
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:06,402
looking straight ahead,
and smiling at his wife

475
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:10,306
in the seat next to him.

476
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,107
So that's it for deliveries?

477
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,943
Oh, you can deliver wherever
and whenever you want,

478
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:18,414
but there is no way I am ever
getting on that bike again.

479
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:23,485
Max, look. Guinevere.

480
00:20:23,487 --> 00:20:24,987
Oh, hell no!

481
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:27,789
She yarn-bombed our darn barn!

482
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:30,092
You two should've tipped.

483
00:20:30,094 --> 00:20:32,761
I'm an artist.

484
00:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,864
Eat my stitches, bitches.

485
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,832
[Gasps]

486
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:39,334
That was not whimsical at all.

487
00:20:39,336 --> 00:20:40,669
Give me the damn bike.

488
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:42,704
Knit's about to hit the fan.

489
00:20:42,706 --> 00:20:44,539
[Can thuds]

490
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,610
Max, you're doing it.

491
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,779
What happened to your fear of bikes?

492
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:54,116
I guess the only thing stronger
is my hatred of that nerd!

493
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,249
