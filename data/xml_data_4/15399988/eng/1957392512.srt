1
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,839
Hello, Mr Herriot.

2
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,599
Hello, Tom. Good of you to
help out the Dalbys like this.

3
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,279
They've always been good
friends of my grandparents.

4
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,480
Mrs Dalby's up in t' field.
I'll take you.

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
Thanks, Tom.

6
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,839
Morning, Mr Herriot.

7
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,719
Thanks for coming out to see us.

8
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,639
And thank you for
being there yesterday.

9
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,239
Billy was a good man.

10
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,439
I wanted to pay my respects.

11
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,279
Their breathing don't
sound right, Mr Herriot.

12
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,199
They were really fit when they
turned out earlier this month.

13
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,120
Then, well...

14
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,760
Let's have a look, then, shall we?

15
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,199
The stirks have got husk, I'm afraid.

16
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,479
For an older cow
this may not be our problem

17
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,959
but as they are still so young...

18
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,879
Aye, and what is husk, exactly?

19
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,439
Well, it's a parasite.

20
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,839
A tiny worm which infests
the bronchial tubes

21
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,999
and sets up bronchitis.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,039
The larvae climb up the blades of grass

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,039
and the cattle eat them as they graze.

24
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,240
Some pastures are badly
affected with it.

25
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,559
I'm sorry but they're pretty bad,
Mrs Dalby.

26
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
A mild attack isn't so bad

27
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:44,639
if you can get them
off the grass right away

28
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,239
but this has gone
a long way beyond that.

29
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,199
What can we do about it, Mr Herriot?

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,679
For a start, we can get them
all inside immediately.

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,519
Every mouthful of this grass
is adding to the worm burden.

32
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Right you are, Mr Herriot.

33
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,239
Can I... tempt you with
the last egg, Mrs H?

34
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,679
No thanks.

35
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,120
Seems a shame to waste it.

36
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,199
I thought you'd be joining your friends

37
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,799
down in London for the cricket.

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,079
Yes, I thought so too

39
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,079
but unfortunately tickets require
money and money requires wages,

40
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,959
neither of which I possess.

41
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,839
So instead, my plan is
three uninterrupted days

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,599
with my feet up, the radio on
and a lovely, cool glass of...

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,799
Well, it took all of five hours

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,319
but Gladys produced
a whopping 18 piglets.

45
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,159
Darrowby record, I believe.

46
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,839
Smells like one, too.

47
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,239
They need cleaning. Get them off.

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,519
Any chance of some breakfast?

49
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,839
I can make you a bacon sandwich.
And those.

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,400
Think I've had enough pig
for one day. Got any eggs?

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,359
You can have the rest
of this one if you like.

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,519
So I'm out working my trousers off

53
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,799
while you're lazing around stuffing
your face with my hard-earned eggs?

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,039
Such is life, big brother.
Such is life.

55
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,959
Go and get changed.
I'll make you some toast.

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,519
You really didn't need to go
to all this trouble. Nonsense.

57
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,439
I hope that tea isn't too
strong for you. It's perfect.

58
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,119
Thank you, Mrs Dalby.

59
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,399
I'll be back up tomorrow
to check on the stirks.

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,439
Meanwhile, it's very important
that you keep them inside.

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,079
Oh. But they'll need feeding.

62
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,359
Well, at this point,

63
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,559
I would start by giving
them the best possible food -

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,799
good hay and high-protein cake.

65
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,959
Cake?

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,879
That's expensive stuff, isn't it?

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,159
And if we give them the hay now,
we'll need to buy more for winter.

68
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,679
I know but a good diet is
our best hope at this stage.

69
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,999
And they can't go out to
feed on the grass ever?

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,159
No. I'm sorry, not on those fields.

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,799
If it was a mild attack,
you could have turned them out

72
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,999
after the dew had left in the mornings

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,360
but that's not the case here.

74
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,439
Right.

75
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,599
Well, thank you, Mr Herriot.
We know where we are anyway.

76
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,679
Billy, love, why don't you take your
brother outside for a kickaround?

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,879
Have we got a young
Gordon Hodgson in the making?

78
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,080
He's my favourite player.

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Good choice.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Go on, Billy, love.

81
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,319
Oi, you.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,519
Excuse me.

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,480
Come on.

84
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,760
So cheeky.

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,199
Do you think we can save them?

86
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Well... we can always hope.

87
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,639
Funny.

88
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,920
That's what my Billy
always used to say.

89
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,599
He was ever the optimist.

90
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,359
Even when the doctor
said it was cancer,

91
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,120
Billy still insisted he'd be fine.

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,160
Time is so fleeting, Mr Herriot.

93
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,319
Any other calls come in?

94
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,520
Nothing.

95
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,199
Shame.

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,319
I guess we will be taking a day off.
Not so fast.

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,999
Equipment needs polishing. Done.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,279
Well, then, the medicines
need topping up. Done.

99
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,839
All done. Play starts
in five minutes, Mrs H.

100
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,679
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What about the...?

101
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,439
What's wrong with Tristan
enjoying the cricket?

102
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,479
He spent all last night
polishing and topping things up.

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,879
There's always more to be done.

104
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,359
Lambing season's almost over.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,359
Summer's our quietest time of year.

106
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,479
Surely the lad's earned
a day or two off now.

107
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,520
Earned?

108
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,600
Well, now he's passed
his exams and all.

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,599
Oh!

110
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,279
James, I'm so sorry.
I didn't see you there.

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
I've probably had worse flung at me.

112
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,159
I wanted to drop in and see
how you were after yesterday.

113
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
Oh, I'm all right, thanks.

114
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,959
It's Phyllis we're worried about.

115
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,999
I was just over there now.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,879
Her stirks have got husk.

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,759
Oh, on top of everything else.

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,759
We offered to help
her out with the kids

119
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,640
but she's determined she can manage.

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,919
Our Jenny was around the same
age as Billy when my mam died.

121
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,520
All the things that family
never got to do together.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,759
Now they never will.

123
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,799
Must have brought back
a lot of painful memories.

124
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,120
Life's cruel sometimes.

125
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,000
Be seeing you again soon? I hope so.

126
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,719
What are you doing tomorrow night?

127
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,759
Going out with you by the sounds of it.

128
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,400
I could pick you up at seven?

129
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,840
I'd like that.

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,760
Thank you.

131
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,279
What on earth?

132
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,839
Tristan, just the man.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,439
Help me carry these out to the barn.

134
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
What's going on? You'll see.

135
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,759
Now, one cannot be a great vet

136
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,399
until one has reared one's own animals.

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,039
Funny, never heard that one before.
Mm-hm.

138
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,839
So here you are, Tristan.

139
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
Meet your new brood.

140
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,719
Wait, what?

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,519
May I suggest you make a start
building a nest box for them?

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,680
A nest box? Nothing like
a fresh egg, warm from the nest.

143
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,200
Hang on, how come James never
had to rear his own animals?

144
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,960
This better not be a flock of sheep.

145
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,999
Is Uncle Herriot here?

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,599
No, Uncle...
Mr Herriot is not here, I'm afraid.

147
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,959
As I'm sure you're aware,
Mrs Pumphrey is attending

148
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,559
the Test match in London and
I am under strict instruction

149
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,760
to deposit Tricki Woo into his
guardianship for the duration.

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,559
I'm sure Mr Farnon can
provide temporary guardianship

151
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,439
until Uncle Herriot returns.

152
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,640
Most kind.

153
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,079
Now the evening sun sends
long shadows over the gasometers,

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,839
Hutton has reached 150

155
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,440
and, with Leyland by his side,
looks like going on to 1,000.

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,079
Oh, thought you were Siegfried.

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,479
Since when do we have hens?

158
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,719
Since my big brother decided I need
to rear my own animals.

159
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,639
What for? Exactly.

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,559
I thought now that
I'm a fully qualified vet

161
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,039
he'd finally stop hectoring me.

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,359
Perhaps he just
doesn't know how to yet.

163
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,759
I don't know.

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Doesn't seem to matter
what I do, it's never enough.

165
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,079
Then why don't you try
standing up to him?

166
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,319
Worked for me.

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,919
You make it sound easy.

168
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,559
Perhaps it is.

169
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,040
Have you met my brother?

170
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,999
What is this supposed to be?

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,159
A nest box?

172
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,320
Give it here.

173
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,679
How was your visit to the Dalbys?

174
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,199
It's not looking good.

175
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,400
Oh, dear.

176
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,279
This is Maggie, by the way.

177
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,959
Say hello, Maggie.

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,919
And, oh, look, this one here is Brenda.

179
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,079
Let me guess - they're all named
after your ex-girlfriends.

180
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,919
No, not at all.

181
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,159
Here she is.

182
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,239
This is Helen,
especially for you, James.

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Who knows? This one might
even let you take her out.

184
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,519
I'll have you know that Helen and I

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,799
are going out on a date tomorrow night.

186
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,039
James!
That's fantastic... Sorry... news!

187
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,239
And where are you taking
the lovely Helen?

188
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,919
Probably just the Drovers.

189
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,199
The Drovers?

190
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,639
Look, tomorrow is your big chance
to finally impress Helen.

191
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,839
You should take her to the Renniston.

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,239
Trust me, women like
to be wined and dined.

193
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,440
Seems a bit grand.

194
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,799
Can't you see it, Jim?

195
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,399
The music oozing out of
Benny Thornton's trombone

196
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,079
and you full of champagne,
and Helen leaning across the table,

197
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,639
the look of love in her eyes.

198
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,560
Oh, kiss me, Helen.

199
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
Oh, OK.

200
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,280
Maybe.

201
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,400
I mean, after Hugh,

202
00:12:42,401 --> 00:12:45,480
she is probably more used
to the finer things in life.

203
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
You still at it?

204
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,199
Sorry.

205
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,640
I'm still struggling to find
anything that might help Mrs Dalby.

206
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,759
Don't worry.

207
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,280
Here, I'll make a fresh pot.

208
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,599
Oh, Mrs Hall,
do you have a spare stamp?

209
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,639
Leave it here and I'll post it for you.

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,840
Thank you.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,319
How is your mother?
Still struggling.

212
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm just trying to help out
where I can but it's...

213
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,319
I'm sure she's grateful
for any help you can manage.

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,520
It still doesn't feel like it's enough.

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,839
To be honest, I just...

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,119
I still have no idea

217
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,440
what I'm supposed to do
about the Glasgow job.

218
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,239
Tricki's finally grown on you, then?

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
Like a fungus.

220
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:57,559
Well, he's definitely
taken a shine to you.

221
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,079
I assure you I've given him
absolutely no reason to.

222
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,239
Could say the same about Tristan.

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,439
He'd follow you
to the ends of the earth.

224
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,640
Only to push me off.

225
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,559
How are Phyllis's stirks
getting on? Not good.

226
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
It's the worst case of
husk I think I've seen.

227
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,080
Where are you up to?

228
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,839
So we've taken the stirks off the field

229
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,599
and I've suggested
a diet of hay and cake. Mm-hm.

230
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,799
But without an effective
treatment to speak of,

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,239
I'm a bit lost as to what else
I can do to try and save them.

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,239
Perhaps you can't save them.

233
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,399
Every problem has a solution.
I just need to find it.

234
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,159
I take it you've given them
the throat injection.

235
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,319
That's just an old farmer's tale.

236
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,999
Don't say that to their faces.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,279
I don't want to give her any more
false hope than I already have done.

238
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,239
And there's not much evidence
to suggest it actually helps.

239
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,679
There's not much evidence
that it doesn't help either.

240
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,759
So what have you got to lose?

241
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,439
Morning, all.
Morning. Morning, Tristan.

242
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,279
Fresh eggs coming right up.

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
We'll make a poulterer of you yet.

244
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,799
Good morning, ladies.

245
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,120
What have you got
for me today, then, hey?

246
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,319
They're just getting used
to their new home.

247
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
Poppycock, they're chickens.

248
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:30,199
They don't know their beak
from their feet.

249
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,239
It's your job to know what's
best for them. My job - exactly.

250
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,479
And I say they just need a bit of
time and they'll figure it out

251
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,719
for themselves.
What they need is guidance.

252
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,479
Find yourself something resembling
an egg then put it in the nest...

253
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,119
No.

254
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,399
No, what? No, I'm not
listening to you any more.

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,119
You put me in charge of these hens
so I'm going to do it my way.

256
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,559
You're being ridiculous.

257
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,799
And I can guarantee that
by tomorrow morning,

258
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,079
these hens will have eggs
coming out of their...

259
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,799
..ears.

260
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,039
Wh...

261
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,159
Oh, God damn it,
you stupid bloody animal.

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,400
God!

263
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,039
Morning, Mrs Dalby.
Hello. How are they today?

264
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,880
Still fighting. I've been giving
them the cake and hay like you said.

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,159
I emptied my penny jar to pay for cake.

266
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,879
You're a good lad, Billy.
Your dad would be proud.

267
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,240
Hey, Billy, give us a hand with this.

268
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,919
I actually dipped into the family
savings to pay for the cake.

269
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,799
But Billy was so desperate to help

270
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,039
that I let him think
we used his pennies.

271
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,439
Probably scatter them on the farm
when he's not looking,

272
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,999
let him think he's found more.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,119
What about a throat injection?
Farmers round here swear by it.

274
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,719
We could try.

275
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,679
It's a mix of chloroform,
turpentine and creosote.

276
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,999
There's no guarantee that it will
help but... We can always hope.

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,960
Right, Mr Herriot? Right, aye.

278
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,599
It's nothing serious.

279
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,439
Just a small cut, by the looks of it.

280
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,479
Well, thank God for that.

281
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,719
Mrs Pumphrey would
have our guts for garters.

282
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,959
That'll teach him to get
involved with the chickens.

283
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,879
Will it? What?

284
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,599
You know very well, what.

285
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,919
If you'd left well alone,
none of this would have happened.

286
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,039
How is it my fault that he...?
All he wants to do is make you proud

287
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,279
but you set these standards for him
that are impossible to meet.

288
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,079
If you just left him to it once
in a while, maybe he'd surprise you.

289
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,159
We're not talking about Tricki Woo
any more, are we?

290
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,119
We're simple folk, really, Mr Farnon.

291
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,959
We all just want the occasional
pat on the head.

292
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,159
Isn't that right, Tricki?

293
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,919
Hm?

294
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
Mm?

295
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,879
Thanks for helping us
with all of this, Mr Herriot.

296
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,639
Yeah, thank you, Mr Herriot.

297
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,959
Not at all.
You did all the hard work.

298
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,719
I had the easy job.

299
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,440
Mr Herriot! Mrs Dalby!

300
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,680
Hey, Billy, why don't you give me
a hand to fetch them some more hay?

301
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,200
I'm so sorry.

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,159
I'm not a farmer.

303
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,799
Billy was the farmer.

304
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,519
He knew everything there was to know

305
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,039
and he was so proud the life we'd
built here and I'm letting him down.

306
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,639
Phyllis, you're not
letting anyone down.

307
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,279
I know it can feel like that sometimes

308
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,439
but you're doing the best you can.

309
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,680
But what if my best isn't good enough?

310
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,800
What you're trying to do here is hard.

311
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Anyone would doubt themselves.

312
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,920
Mum, are we going to be all right?

313
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
Come here, love.

314
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
Of course we are.

315
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,839
Here we go, James.

316
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,039
All fresh and aired.

317
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
Thanks, Mrs H.

318
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,839
Oh, very handsome.

319
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,319
It'll be a miracle if they
make it through the night.

320
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,519
Having been proved wrong
more than once,

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,080
I've learned never to underestimate
the resilience of nature.

322
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,919
Right, well, I best be off.

323
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,759
Cheerio. Good luck.

324
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,319
Oh...

325
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
Wait a sec.

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,079
I've posted your letter for you.
Thanks.

327
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,399
I know it's hard but you've done
what you can today

328
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,879
for Phyllis and your mother.

329
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Now go have a wonderful time
with Helen. It's important.

330
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,679
Mr Ingledew. Good evening.

331
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,919
I presume this is yours.

332
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,359
I saw them arrive yesterday.

333
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
Tristan?

334
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
Tristan!

335
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,320
Thanks, James.

336
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,120
Come on, Annabel, let's get you home.

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,039
God!

338
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,240
That was close.

339
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,400
Damn it.

340
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, no!

341
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,880
Damn it.

342
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,599
Oh, dear.

343
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,080
You'd better come in, James.

344
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,919
Oh, dear, indeed.

345
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,119
The car ran into a bit of
a ditch on the way over.

346
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,839
Perhaps you can borrow
a pair of my dad's shoes.

347
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,399
Oh, no, that's quite all right.
You can't go out like that.

348
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,759
Dad, lend James some shoes
and socks, will you?

349
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,840
There's really no need...
Nonsense. Dad don't mind.

350
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,000
Here. You can wipe your trousers
down with this. Thanks.

351
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,279
There you go.

352
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,440
My old dancing shoes.

353
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,439
Been a while since
they've had an outing.

354
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,199
Oh... Honestly, I'll be fine.

355
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,960
Are they not to your liking, James?

356
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,359
No, no, these are...

357
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,560
They're perfect.

358
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,639
Thank you, Mr Alderson.

359
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,599
Aye.

360
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,120
I'll go see what Helen's up to.

361
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,120
James is here.

362
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,479
Can you make sure dad checks
the tarpaulin on the barn roof

363
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,919
and make sure...?
Stop worrying. Go enjoy yourself.

364
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Me and Dad will be
just fine without you.

365
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,800
Sorry, James.

366
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,639
I thought we could go to the
Renniston for dinner.

367
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,120
I should go and get changed, then.
No, you look...

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,600
..perfect.

369
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,480
Go on, then. Don't want to
be late for the Renniston.

370
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,479
I won't be late.

371
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,680
Enjoy yourself, love.

372
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
Goodbye.

373
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:05,960
I'll get it!

374
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,000
Tristan!

375
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,359
I give you this simple, little job
one would have thought even you

376
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,599
would be hard put to make a mess
of it and look at the situation.

377
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,399
Not one solitary egg have we seen,

378
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,119
the bloody hens are flying
about the place like pigeons

379
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,559
and we are now permanently
estranged from our neighbours.

380
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,879
I'm sorry, Siegfried.
I'm sure I put the latch down.

381
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,120
I always double-check.
I don't...

382
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,279
..want to hear it. Just... try not to
burn the house down while I'm out.

383
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,799
Who's up for games night?

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,999
Sorry, Mrs Hall, I'm out
with Diana tonight.

385
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,719
In fact...

386
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,000
..I'm running late as it is.

387
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,279
I've got to see a man...

388
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,319
..about a chicken.

389
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,800
Sorry, Mrs H.

390
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,760
Right...

391
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,520
Just me then, is it?

392
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,480
Thank you.

393
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,480
Miss Alderson, how lovely
to see you again. Hello.

394
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,439
Would you care for a table, sir?

395
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,439
Yes, please.

396
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,640
Table for two.

397
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,920
This way, please.

398
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,400
Excuse me?

399
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,640
How's Phyllis getting on?

400
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,319
She lost one of her stirks
when I was there today.

401
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,919
Oh, James, I'm so sorry. That must
have been difficult for you both.

402
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,919
I just wish I'd seen them sooner.

403
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,479
She might have had
a fighting chance a week ago.

404
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,959
Well, you're there now,

405
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
and if anyone can pull it off,
it's Phyllis.

406
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,919
I just worry it's too little, too late.

407
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,119
It's not like you to give up so easily.

408
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,479
You didn't see her today.

409
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,679
She's already having to use
her winter supply of hay

410
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,599
and spending money that she
doesn't have on expensive cake.

411
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,559
I just want to give her
any more false hope.

412
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,679
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be
burdening you with all of this.

413
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,159
You're not burdening me.

414
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,400
It's nice that you care.

415
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,719
Farming's a tough life.

416
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,919
So much loss and hardship.

417
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,200
It's bloody hard work.

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,639
Do you ever think you could leave?

419
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,799
Do something different? Me?

420
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,039
I think about it all the time.

421
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,799
I think what it might be like to
not have dirt under my fingernails

422
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,040
every day, not have to worry
about money, or shovel muck.

423
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,560
Thank you.

424
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
Thank you.

425
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,199
I've been thinking
about Phyllis and farming

426
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,679
and what you were saying
just now and... and...

427
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,599
And what, James?

428
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,519
Well, perhaps it doesn't
have to be a struggle...

429
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,239
..for Phyllis.

430
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,999
All the other farmers think
she should sell the farm

431
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,239
and maybe they're right.
Maybe it's not too late.

432
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,879
She could sell up, move away,
make a fresh start somewhere new.

433
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,039
All the memories of Billy
are tied up in that farm.

434
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,639
All the boy's memories.

435
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,439
That would mean her leaving behind
everything she's ever known.

436
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,079
It's what I had to do.

437
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,640
That's different.
You made a choice to come here.

438
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,479
It doesn't mean it was easy.

439
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,320
My life was in Glasgow,
my friends, my family.

440
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,240
It's not the same.

441
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
Why not?

442
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,080
Because I'm not a farmer?

443
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,999
Because your life isn't
the ground under your feet.

444
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,799
You haven't poured blood, sweat and
tears into the soil you plough.

445
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,639
You haven't raised animals from
birth knowing they could be

446
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,279
taken from your any moment
and, with them, your livelihood.

447
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,159
I feel like you're making
my argument for me.

448
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,919
Billy Dalby took on
that farm from his father,

449
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,239
and his father before him.
It's young Billy's birthright.

450
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,600
So long as there's
something left to inherit.

451
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,920
So you can see yourself
ever leaving, then?

452
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,839
Well, I'm not going to
live with my dad forever

453
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,480
but I could never be too far away.

454
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
I can't expect you to understand that.

455
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,159
No.

456
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,720
You're probably right.

457
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,799
Is there a spare one of those going?

458
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,399
Coming right up.

459
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,479
Its not the good stuff I'm afraid,
Siegfried would kill me.

460
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,800
As long as it's strong and large,
I don't care.

461
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Want to talk about it?

462
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,839
Not really.

463
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,519
What have you been up to?

464
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,879
The usual - disappointing Siegfried,
annoying the neighbours,

465
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,240
creating avian anarchy.

466
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,399
Siegfried still on your case then?

467
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,759
I think it's his life's work
to be on my case.

468
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,479
His magnum opus will be the utter
destruction and destitution

469
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,879
of his little brother.

470
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,479
Did you try standing up to him,
like I suggested?

471
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,759
I did, yes.

472
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,519
Now it's made everything worse.

473
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,080
But I've got a plan.

474
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,920
Won't it feel like a shallow victory?

475
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,880
A victory is a victory nonetheless.

476
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,440
Hello.

477
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,600
Look at that!

478
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,840
He's only gone and bloody done it.

479
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,880
The taste of a fresh egg,
can't beat it.

480
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
Are you heading up to
the Dalby's today?

481
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,479
Unfortunately, yes.

482
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,559
I have no idea what to say to the
poor woman. I could see the look

483
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,760
of hope on her face when I gave
the stirks the throat injection.

484
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,279
I don't know.

485
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,079
I just don't feel like I'm
being honest.

486
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,640
Honesty is the best policy.

487
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,279
Of course, the throat injection
was never going to work.

488
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,559
What?

489
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,039
But you were the one that told me
to give it to them.

490
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,680
This isn't about the injection.

491
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,199
Look, it's the worst part of the job

492
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,639
when you realise everything
is in the lap of the gods.

493
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,039
But at least now you can
look Phyllis in the eye and tell her

494
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,959
you have tried absolutely everything.

495
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,239
And as long as you've tried everything,

496
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,600
then you've done your job.

497
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,680
You'll find the right thing to say,
I have no doubt.

498
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,240
Thanks, Siegfried.

499
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,799
I know that I can set these high
standards at times,

500
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,039
and perhaps come across
as slightly overbearing...

501
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,240
Slightly.

502
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,120
It's only because I want
the best for you both.

503
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,880
And, Tristan, maybe I should
trust you a bit more.

504
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,560
And...

505
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,040
..recognise your successes
when you have them.

506
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,159
It's a week's wage.

507
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,439
Well done.

508
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,039
You were right about the hens

509
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,640
and you've more than proved
yourself of late.

510
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,839
Thanks, Siegfried.

511
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,200
You've earned it.

512
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,640
Actually, I've got
a confession to make.

513
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
I think I'd better get going.

514
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
Confession?

515
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,999
It's just, I wanted
so desperately to make you proud

516
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,280
and do something right for
a change and...

517
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,080
..I lied.

518
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,239
I bought the eggs from the grocers
and planted them

519
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,600
in the nest box last night.

520
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
Here.

521
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,079
Right...

522
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,639
Take it.

523
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,159
We all make mistakes.

524
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,440
The thing is to forgive and...

525
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
..learn from them.

526
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,359
What mistakes?

527
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,239
Well, it might have been me
that left the barn door open.

528
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,920
In my defence, Tricky had just
been attacked and...

529
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,999
I suppose that makes us even,
doesn't it?

530
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
Does it?
I'd take it if I were you.

531
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,520
I'll get it.

532
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,120
Thanks, Siegfried.

533
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,039
I see you've lost another one.

534
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,759
We have.

535
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,159
But Mrs Dalby's sure she noticed an
improvement in the others' appetite.

536
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,399
That must be a good sign.

537
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,280
Let's go have a look at them, shall we?

538
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,119
How are they looking, Mr Herriot?

539
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,479
I wish I had some better news,
but they're still very sick.

540
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,079
Now, I know you've told me
not to turn the young beasts

541
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:22,320
out onto the field any more,
but isn't there a way around it?

542
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,679
Perhaps it could help to get them
back outside.

543
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,959
No, I'm sorry.

544
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,719
Until there's a vaccine,
there's no way of safeguarding them

545
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,920
against husk.

546
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,239
Then we will just have to find
another solution.

547
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,440
I...

548
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,319
Mrs Dalby,

549
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,200
this is what I've been meaning to
talk to you about.

550
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,919
I've been giving the matter a great
deal of thought and, well,

551
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,400
you've lost so much already...

552
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,760
I just couldn't live with myself if
I didn't give you my honest opinion.

553
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
I see.

554
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,159
I'm so sorry.

555
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,479
I really am, but we've tried
everything now, and there's still

556
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,560
a very real chance you could end up
losing the entire herd.

557
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,480
So there's a chance that we
might not then?

558
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
A slim one, yes.

559
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,080
I've given you so much
false hope already.

560
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,279
I really think that now your best
course of action is to sell

561
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,520
the farm before it's too late.

562
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,719
There's nothing false about hope,
Mr Herriot.

563
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,000
Yes, but...
I appreciate your honesty, I do.

564
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,239
But I've been giving it a great
deal of thought too,

565
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,080
and I understand the risk involved.

566
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,560
But, when I look around...

567
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,119
..I don't just see the things
I've lost or might lose,

568
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,400
I see everything I have.

569
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,440
I see my boys.

570
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,760
How I have so much
worth fighting for still.

571
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,839
And I owe it to them,
to my family, not to give up.

572
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,520
Even if it is the slimmest
of chances, I'll take it.

573
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,599
I might not have been able to
save my husband, Mr Herriot,

574
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,200
but I can save our farm.

575
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,000
Our home.

576
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,200
So we're staying put.

577
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,519
Like my Billy always used to say,

578
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,320
only them as has them can lose them.

579
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,439
Now, come on,
you must have one of these scones,

580
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,800
they're fresh from the oven.

581
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,679
That's it, that's the record.

582
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,160
He's done it!

583
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,160
Brilliant, brilliant.

584
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
Wonderful.

585
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,040
I'll get it.

586
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Tricky, Mummy's here.

587
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Darling, dearest boy,
how have you been?

588
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,639
Mrs Pumphrey, do come in.

589
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,479
Thank you.

590
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,079
Forgive my early arrival,

591
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,079
our separation became far too
unbearable.

592
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,679
Quite all right.
I'll fetch some tea.

593
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,199
Do sit down, Mrs Pumphrey.
Allow me.

594
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,400
Thank you.

595
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,199
I so appreciate his Uncle Herriot
looking after him so well.

596
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,879
Where is our dear James?

597
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,039
Out on a call, I'm afraid.

598
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,039
Oh, what a pity.

599
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,039
How was your trip?

600
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,839
Hutton and Leyland made quite the pair.

601
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,799
I almost dropped my binoculars
in all the excitement.

602
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,199
We just heard,
Hutton beat Bradman's record.

603
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,039
Terrific!

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,359
Which reminds me, I do hope you are
practising your inswinger,

605
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,879
ready for
my little cricket match this summer.

606
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,559
Of course, wouldn't miss it for the
world, Mrs Pumphrey.

607
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,719
Wonderful.

608
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,119
Look, Tricky, your favourite.

609
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,959
He does love a home-made biscuit.

610
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,199
They're actually for you, Mrs Pumphrey.

611
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,719
Oh, I only eat a Fortnum myself.

612
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,239
But Tricky is a little less fussy.

613
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,759
And how was my darling boy been?

614
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,480
I do hope he has behaved himself.

615
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Well...

616
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,599
Honesty...

617
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,800
Yes, um...

618
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,159
Truth be told, there was
a slight incident.

619
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,159
I took temporary charge
of Tricky while James...

620
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,719
While Uncle Herriot was on a call,

621
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,559
turned my back for a second

622
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,639
and Tricky did receive a tiny
peck from one of our hens.

623
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:29,399
I take full responsibility,
I'm terribly sorry.

624
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,679
Tricky always goes
completely cracker-dog

625
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,679
when there's a chicken in sight.

626
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,119
Tricky woo-lally I call it.

627
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,039
I couldn't tell you what
he has against them

628
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,359
but that will be the fifth peck
he has had this year.

629
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,199
Oh, right.

630
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,839
Perhaps it's because he's an only dog.

631
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,439
I do think that an only
develops more prejudices

632
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,960
than one from a large family.

633
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,680
Wouldn't you agree?

634
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,200
Try not to be upset.

635
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
You will see your uncles
again very soon.

636
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,840
And the pain of parting is
nothing to the joy of meeting again.

637
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,319
Thank you.

638
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,640
Good day, Mrs Pumphrey.

639
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,160
Goodbye, Tricky.

640
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,119
Oh, of course, Tricky, yes,
where are my manners?

641
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,840
Francois, would you mind?

642
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,800
You reminded me...

643
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,319
To say thank you.

644
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,560
Oh.

645
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,960
To his Uncle Herriot.

646
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,280
The kippers - exquisite.

647
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,639
Right, home, please, Francois.

648
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,479
Toodle-oo.

649
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,080
Bye-bye.

650
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,000
Come on!

651
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,360
Phyllis lost another stirk.

652
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,520
A few more are on their way out.

653
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,279
But she is determined to keep going,

654
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,000
even if it's only with half a herd.

655
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,999
You were right.

656
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,720
I get it now, and I'm sorry about...

657
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,920
This was my mum's favourite spot
up here on this roof.

658
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,439
Used to come up here at lunchtime
and eat our sandwiches.

659
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,679
She'd point out different
parts of the farm and tell me,

660
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,760
"That's where you scraped your knee
trying to jump over the bales."

661
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,120
"That's where you helped out
with your first lambing."

662
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,040
"And that spot there..."

663
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,640
"..that's where I told your dad
I were pregnant with you."

664
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,320
"And his grin filled
his whole face."

665
