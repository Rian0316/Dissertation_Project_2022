00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,963
This town was my home once. I want it back.

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,783
Genevieve: Drink.

4
00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:08,118
It's the only way I can show
you what you need to see.

5
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,252
Rebekah: There's only ever been one man

6
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,487
Klaus has truly feared... my father, Mikael.

7
00:00:10,489 --> 00:00:11,821
We'd like you to find Mikael.

8
00:00:11,823 --> 00:00:12,856
Of course.

9
00:00:12,858 --> 00:00:14,257
You needed to see it,

10
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:18,194
and now you can take your revenge.

11
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:22,532
Yaagh! Go.

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,119
Run as far and as fast as you can.

13
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:27,055
I'm afraid you're trapped.

14
00:00:27,057 --> 00:00:28,456
Boundary spell.

15
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,558
The Originals can enter,
but they can't leave.

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,295
Rebekah! Cherish the breath in your lungs!

17
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,331
It'll be your last.

[Whimpers]

23
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:58,986
Hush now. It's just a storm.

24
00:00:59,038 --> 00:01:03,374
Don't be afraid. I won't let it hurt you.

25
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:08,646
Nik, don't go.

26
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:20,157
I carved it for father.

27
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,727
It's a brave knight.

28
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,697
Now you can be brave, too.

29
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,901
Will you stay with me till the storm ends?

30
00:01:34,806 --> 00:01:37,608
I will always stay with you, Rebekah,

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,910
no matter what.

32
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,685
Klaus: Rebekah!

33
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,222
- Walk away.
- Don't move!

34
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:53,590
Leave us now.

35
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,893
I can't. I'm stuck here.

36
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,364
Elijah, he has a white oak stick.

37
00:02:00,366 --> 00:02:02,499
I brought it for you, sister.

38
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,834
Elijah: Get out of his sight.

39
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:05,969
Your presence here only
serves to anger him.

40
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,539
Leave him to me now.

41
00:02:13,912 --> 00:02:18,215
I'm asking you brother to brother,

42
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,684
we end this nonsense now.

43
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,419
You would side with that traitor?

44
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:24,655
I am not choosing sides,
but I will not allow you

45
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:26,957
to hurt our sister.

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,696
We cannot leave this cemetery, Elijah.

47
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:36,066
How long do you think you can defend her?

48
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:41,671
As long as it takes...

49
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:46,510
by whatever means necessary.

Do whatever it takes. Just stay alive.

53
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:56,953
I promise you, I'll get you out of there.

54
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,622
I've never seen him like this before.

55
00:02:58,624 --> 00:03:00,056
He's out of his mind with rage,

56
00:03:00,058 --> 00:03:01,758
up all night howling one
obscenity-laced tirade

57
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,660
after the next.

58
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,762
He's gonna kill me.

59
00:03:05,764 --> 00:03:07,630
All right. Stay as far
away from him as you can.

60
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:08,965
That's a brilliant strategy,

61
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:10,333
but, given that that dead bitch Celeste

62
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,569
has trapped us in here till moonrise,

63
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:13,970
my options are somewhat limited.

64
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:15,472
I'm not leaving you in there.

65
00:03:15,474 --> 00:03:17,474
Davina will find a
loophole, get you out early.

66
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,842
Then we can all go together.

67
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:20,076
If Klaus comes after us,

68
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:21,744
we will take him on one hell of a ride.

69
00:03:21,746 --> 00:03:23,947
I lived for centuries
looking over my shoulder,

70
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:26,282
ready to run at a moment's notice.

71
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,850
Am I to go back to that?

72
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,152
Worry about that later.

73
00:03:29,154 --> 00:03:30,787
Right now, just buy me some time.

74
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:32,522
I promise you, I'll get you out of there.

76
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:39,028
Hey, D., how you feel?

77
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Got you some stuff...

78
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,683
organic soap and scented candles,

79
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:47,420
some incense.

80
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:48,955
Just trying to help
you get back to feeling,

81
00:03:48,957 --> 00:03:51,924
you know, yourself.

82
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:02,344
Word on the street is, the
witches are celebrating.

83
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:04,046
3 out of the 4 girls
sacrificed in the harvest

84
00:04:04,048 --> 00:04:05,614
have come back.

85
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,182
First, it was your friend Monique

86
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:10,085
and then another girl, now you.

87
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:11,954
What I hear, the others are
saying that the ancestors

88
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:14,389
were with them while they were...

89
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:16,024
dead, you know,

90
00:04:16,026 --> 00:04:17,759
talking to them, teaching them.

91
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:19,728
They say they're stronger than ever.

92
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:24,099
Was it like that for you?

93
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,002
No.

94
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:29,237
There was nothing.

95
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:32,441
It was cold, empty, and dark,

96
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:34,910
and it went on forever.

97
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:40,996
I'm sorry, D.

98
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:43,231
I don't want to talk about it.

99
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:47,569
Please, Marcel, don't make me.

100
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:52,174
Elijah: You've been at this for hours...

101
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,775
to what end?

102
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:56,912
Niklaus, I know you, and
I grew up fighting you.

103
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:59,406
I can't be beaten, nor can I be persuaded.

104
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,641
You cannot get past me.

105
00:05:01,643 --> 00:05:03,376
Klaus: I could get past you,

106
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:04,611
although it might have to be

107
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,479
over your dead body.

108
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,048
You did stab me with that blade,

109
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,416
forcing me to endure hours

110
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:11,384
of unspeakable pain.

111
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:15,989
Perhaps I should direct my rage toward you.

112
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,791
You should see yourself...

113
00:05:17,793 --> 00:05:21,294
the murderous expression,
the self-righteous posturing.

114
00:05:21,296 --> 00:05:24,164
You look like father.

115
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:29,202
I'm not him.

116
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:32,005
Rebekah's betrayal justifies my anger.

117
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,907
His was that of a madman.

118
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:36,509
You were never the
recipient of his cruelty.

119
00:05:36,511 --> 00:05:38,545
None of you were... not Kol, not Finn,

120
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,846
none of you!

121
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:45,485
I think you've forgotten
what he was truly like.

122
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,387
No.

123
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,356
I have not forgotten.

124
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:54,027
Be still.

125
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:56,329
Deep breath.

126
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:58,564
Hold. Now.

127
00:06:01,602 --> 00:06:03,569
Your aim is improving.

128
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,605
Next time.

129
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:08,040
Mikael: You encourage him, Elijah,

130
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:11,244
but he grows more pathetic every day.

131
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,278
I'm not pathetic.

132
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,714
Do not talk back to me.

133
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,622
Not man enough to hold this weapon.

134
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:17,894
If you can't hunt,

135
00:06:17,896 --> 00:06:19,296
you're nothing but a burden.

136
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:20,430
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,998
It's a shame we can't feed

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,466
on sad-eyed apologies.

139
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,235
It's your one and only skill.

140
00:06:25,237 --> 00:06:26,736
Elijah: Father, stop.

141
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:29,839
Stay back, or you'll be next.

142
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,775
The boy needs to be made strong.

143
00:06:31,777 --> 00:06:33,877

[Wind whistling]

145
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:51,628
Niklaus, I understand your anger,

146
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,163
but, I implore you, be better than him.

147
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,232
Do what he could not.

148
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,003
Demonstrate the grace of mercy

149
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,671
rather than this petty cruelty.

150
00:07:01,673 --> 00:07:04,574
You ask me to show mercy
to one who has wronged me.

151
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,712
You really don't know me
at all, do you, brother?

152
00:07:09,714 --> 00:07:12,148
Rebekah: Enough.

153
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,217
Whatever I have done wrong,

154
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,187
my guilt is nothing compared to yours.

155
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,223
You want revenge?

156
00:07:20,225 --> 00:07:22,358
Fine, but before you have it,

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,626
I will look you in the eye and tell you

158
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:27,530
why it was your cruelty and your spite

159
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,266
that led us to this.

160
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:32,501
Go on, then.

161
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:34,537
Speak your piece,

162
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:36,672
and when you are finished, I will grant you

163
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:40,009
the punishment you deserve,

164
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,212
even if I have to go
through Elijah to do so.

165
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,298
Davina...

166
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:10,718
Marcel told me you were up here.

167
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:13,612
Do you want to tell me what happened?

168
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:19,317
I died...

169
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,421
And at first, I was alone,

170
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:25,824
but then I heard them,

171
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:28,894
voices whispering to me.

172
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:32,731
- Who?
- The ancestors.

173
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:36,535
They're so angry with me.

174
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:39,271
I used my power against my own,

175
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:43,074
and they said they'd
do horrible things to me

176
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,377
if I misuse my magic again.

177
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,165
Kieran: So a century
ago, you betrayed Klaus,

178
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,200
the most dangerous vampire in history,

179
00:08:52,202 --> 00:08:53,835
and the only one that can save you

180
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:57,072
is the girl that you had
locked up in my attic,

181
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:58,907
but she's a basket case.

182
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,508
So really, your only hope

183
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,477
is my niece, psychoanalyst

184
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:04,312
to resurrected teen witches.

185
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:05,914
Does that about sum it up?

186
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:09,050
You're pretty smug for
a guy with a witch's hex.

187
00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:11,686
Davina's magic is you only shot at a cure.

188
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:16,391
Let's not dance around the obvious.

189
00:09:16,393 --> 00:09:19,027
This hex is going to be the end of me.

190
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,062
Every spell has a loophole.

191
00:09:21,064 --> 00:09:23,464
You, of all people, should have more faith.

192
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:28,736
I lost my faith when Sean died.

193
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:33,107
When I came back to New Orleans,

194
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:35,076
I had nothing but hope of preventing a war

195
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:36,944
between the vampires and the witches,

196
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:38,613
and now the witches are out of control,

197
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,415
and you allowed an Original vampire

198
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:44,619
to take control of the quarter.

199
00:09:44,621 --> 00:09:47,388
No. There is no hope...

200
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,856
not for you, not for the city,

201
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:51,058
and certainly not for me.

202
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
I get Davina back, she will find a way

203
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,562
- to take down Klaus.
- No.

204
00:09:54,564 --> 00:09:57,098
He's going to get out of
this trap that he's in,

205
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,533
and when he does, he's going to find you,

206
00:09:59,535 --> 00:10:02,169
and he is going to tear you into pieces.

207
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:07,274
You reap what you sow, Marcel.

208
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:09,076
Klaus: Let it begin...

209
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,613
the trial of Rebekah Mikaelson.

210
00:10:12,615 --> 00:10:15,316
What a relief. His ego is in check.

211
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,818
Just speak your truth.

212
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,588
I'll make certain he behaves himself.

213
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,690
You stand accused of
betraying your own blood.

214
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:25,059
How do you plead?

215
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,494
I plead you to shut up and listen.

216
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:30,130
You summoned our father.
You brought him to our home.

217
00:10:30,132 --> 00:10:32,266
What possible defense could you have?

218
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:33,968
I knew he was the only
thing that you feared,

219
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,636
and I wanted you to run.

220
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:36,937
Because you hated me.

221
00:10:36,939 --> 00:10:38,138
Because you were hateful.

222
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,807
You denied me the freedom to love.

223
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:42,576
Oh, so that's your defense?

224
00:10:42,578 --> 00:10:45,512
You called Mikael... the destroyer,

225
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,948
the hunter of vampires...
because I detained you

226
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,184
from pursuing some dull suitors.

227
00:10:50,186 --> 00:10:51,785
You were cruel

228
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:53,820
and controlling and manipulative.

229
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,423
I was trying to protect you

230
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:59,359
from imbeciles and leeches,

231
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:01,628
not to mention your own poor judgment.

232
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:02,963
And what about the one

233
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:05,165
that you loved enough to call friend?

234
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,367
Why did you forbid me to love Marcel?

235
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:10,203
Do not mention his name.

236
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:13,540
What has happened to you?

237
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:16,543
I remember the sweet boy who made me laugh

238
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,846
and gave me gifts,

239
00:11:19,848 --> 00:11:23,650
who loved art and music.

240
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,186
I wanted to be just like you.

241
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,057
How could you have fallen so far?

242
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,497
You say you despise Rebekah

243
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,232
for her betrayal,

244
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:42,502
and yet no one has stood by your side

245
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:45,205
for so long, not even I myself.

246
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:48,308
Perhaps it's you that's forgotten.

247
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,976
I remember the day that father

248
00:11:49,978 --> 00:11:51,745
caught you whittling little chess pieces

249
00:11:51,747 --> 00:11:54,047
with his hunting knife.

250
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:58,585
He beat you so mercilessly and for so long,

251
00:11:58,587 --> 00:12:00,753
I actually feared for your life.

252
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,355
- Aah!
- Father!

253
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,858
- Please.
- Stay back.

254
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,894
- No.
- Stop it. Stop it.

255
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,766
I will not let you hurt him anymore.

256
00:12:13,768 --> 00:12:18,137
You stand against me

257
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,772
for him?

258
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:37,290
So you would paint her as a loyal sister,

259
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:41,460
but she betrayed me out of lust for Marcel.

260
00:12:41,462 --> 00:12:44,330
Perhaps that was why you did it...

261
00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:46,365
for love.

262
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,200
Perhaps I might temper my rage

263
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,635
if Rebekah will admit she was a victim

264
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,705
of her own idiocy, that
her great love Marcel

265
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:56,909
used her to oust this
family and to take my city.

266
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:59,745
Marcel did not manipulate me.

267
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,116
You defend him, and yet you can't help

268
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:07,286
but wonder, what if I'm right?

269
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:09,455
We loved each other.

270
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,357
It was your refusal to respect that

271
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,758
that led to your ruin.

272
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,393
Then why didn't he chase after you

273
00:13:14,395 --> 00:13:16,328
when you fled New Orleans?

274
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,930
Oh, yes. That's right.

275
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:20,299
He was here stealing what I built.

276
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,668
You want me to renounce Marcel,

277
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,006
to beg for your forgiveness?

278
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,607
I won't.

279
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:31,777
Marcel is not at fault. I called Mikael.

280
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,612
Elijah: Rebekah, you must...

281
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:35,347
I was the one who
brought him to New Orleans

282
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,517
because of your wickedness.

283
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,419
I wanted love and happiness,

284
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:42,855
and denied me the freedom to have either.

285
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:47,092
Yes. I hated and I was
afraid of our father,

286
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,661
but he was a lesser evil than you,

287
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,130
my bastard brother who loomed over me,

288
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,199
threatening me as you are now.

289
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,668
I wanted rid of you,

290
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,239
and given the choice, I'd do it again.

291
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,308
Yaah!

292
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,810
Uh!

293
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,153
Sister, leave us.

294
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,188
I won't go.

295
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,356
I said, leave us, please.

296
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,163
You wouldn't listen to her.

297
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:27,832
So now you must deal with me.

298
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,325
I've studied the effects
of trauma and abuse.

299
00:14:42,327 --> 00:14:44,527
The witches that forced
you into that ritual,

300
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:45,595
they've lied to you.

301
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:47,630
- They hurt you.
- Cami...

302
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:49,132
There's nothing you've studied in some book

303
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:51,000
that can help me.

304
00:14:51,002 --> 00:14:55,204
Ok. Forget the books.

305
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:58,441
Let me tell you what
I know from experience.

306
00:14:58,443 --> 00:15:02,378
When my brother died, I
never thought I'd be ok again.

307
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,213
I cried for weeks. I blamed myself.

308
00:15:04,215 --> 00:15:06,149
I blamed him, and then I realized

309
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:10,553
all that sadness was swallowing me up,

310
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:14,023
and I made a choice I
wasn't going to let it.

311
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:17,527
You can make that choice, Davina.

312
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,064
You say that like it's so simple,

313
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:24,867
but the witches aren't
just gonna let me go.

314
00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:26,636
They're not done with me.

315
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:29,505
No one can control you unless you let them.

316
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:31,874
How do I even know who to trust?

317
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,543
Should I trust Marcel?

318
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,580
The first thing he did when I came back

319
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,416
was try to use me again to help Rebekah.

320
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:44,587
Be honest, Cami.

321
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,589
Isn't there something you want, too?

322
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:51,160
Yeah. My Uncle is sick.

323
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,395
I thought you could help him.

324
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:58,067
That's not why I'm here.

325
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:01,237
I care about you. I want to help you.

326
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,838
What can you do?

327
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,840
When I came back, the voices I heard,

328
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,542
they said the only ones who could help me

329
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,977
are the witches, but
after what I did to them,

330
00:16:08,979 --> 00:16:11,580
they hate me.

331
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:14,616
So how can I go back and
ask for their help now?

332
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,296
Rebekah: What a fool I am.

333
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:30,265
I actually thought Davina
would come to the rescue.

334
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,633
I'll get someone else.

335
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:32,935
Whole town is full of witches.

336
00:16:32,937 --> 00:16:34,469
All of whom despise you.

337
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:35,704
I'll figure this out.

338
00:16:35,706 --> 00:16:36,872
Meantime, just don't piss Klaus off

339
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:38,206
any more than he already is.

340
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,808
It's a little late for that.

341
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:42,144
I may have provoked him further,

342
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,613
but then, I didn't much
care for his accusations

343
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:46,782
that you seduced me into bringing Mikael.

344
00:16:46,784 --> 00:16:49,584
Wait a minute. I would never do that.

345
00:16:53,756 --> 00:16:56,291
We almost got away.

346
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,592
If we just kept going,

347
00:16:57,594 --> 00:16:59,861
we could be anywhere in the world by now.

348
00:17:01,297 --> 00:17:03,298
Klaus might've found us and killed us,

349
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,367
but he'll do that, anyway.

350
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,103
Would've been nice to have
a little happiness first.

351
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:10,772
He's not gonna kill you. You're his sister.

352
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,140
And you're like a son to him,

353
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:14,309
and, believe me, he means to kill you.

354
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:22,350
You know, I've never
much thought about dying,

355
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:25,053
one of the perks of
being immortal, I guess.

356
00:17:27,022 --> 00:17:30,692
What an odd thing it
is to be here one minute

357
00:17:30,694 --> 00:17:33,228
and gone the next...

358
00:17:34,663 --> 00:17:36,664
rather terrifying.

359
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,075
Rebekah...

360
00:17:40,077 --> 00:17:42,777
You need to run, Marcel.

361
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,612
When the moon reaches its apex,

362
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,047
Klaus will be free, and he will do to you

363
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,784
what he's going to do to me, only worse.

364
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:53,154
Go now and don't look back.

365
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:54,889
[Beep]

366
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,060
Klaus: So what's it gonna be?

367
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:01,229
You hold both weapons.

368
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:02,797
Tunde's blade'd put me down,

369
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,466
but the stake could finish me off for good.

370
00:18:05,468 --> 00:18:08,303
Well... unlike you, brother...
I have no taste for fratricide.

371
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:12,173
I only hold this to keep it from you.

372
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,109
This is just my insurance.

373
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:18,079
Why must you defend her?

374
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:20,448
Rebekah betrayed you, as well,

375
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,050
when she brought Mikael here.

376
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:24,152
Because she is our sister

377
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:26,120
and because I like to remember
her the way that she was

378
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:28,756
before we became what we became.

379
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,291
Ha ha ha!

380
00:18:30,293 --> 00:18:31,492
Elijah, voice-over: She
was an innocent girl,

381
00:18:31,494 --> 00:18:34,328
quick to laugh, full of life.

382
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:41,067
My memories serve to make
her betrayal more painful.

383
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:43,803
Can you not then accept
some small part of the blame?

384
00:18:43,805 --> 00:18:46,339
After all, Niklaus, it was your cruelty

385
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,207
that led her to do what she did.

386
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,542
Do you not see, Elijah?

387
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:50,843
She didn't mean to chase me off.

388
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,044
She wanted me dead.

389
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,479
You're wrong.

390
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:56,816
She has always hated me.

391
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:58,851
You know that's true.

392
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:01,587
You have no idea, do you?

393
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:05,603
You have no idea what she
was prepared to do for you.

394
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,472
When our sister sees
something that she perceives

395
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:10,641
to be an injustice, she can be stubborn,

396
00:19:10,643 --> 00:19:14,778
impetuous, and, at times,
downright dangerous,

397
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,580
and never was this more apparent

398
00:19:16,582 --> 00:19:19,483
than the night she
tried to kill our father.

399
00:19:19,485 --> 00:19:21,418
What is this,

400
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
some melodramatic fiction

401
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,456
designed to garner my sympathy?

402
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,791
It is the truth.

403
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:30,928
I was there...

404
00:19:32,163 --> 00:19:34,831
Elijah, voice-over: And
she would have done it,

405
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:39,336
all to protect you, had I not stopped her.

406
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:46,743
I often wished that I
could revisit that moment,

407
00:19:46,745 --> 00:19:49,112
complete the task myself.

408
00:19:49,114 --> 00:19:52,616
Why are you telling me this now?

409
00:19:52,618 --> 00:19:56,153
Niklaus, sometimes our
sister acts without thinking.

410
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:57,587
She's short of temper.

411
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:01,091
She's quick to fall in
love, but she loves you,

412
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:05,529
but your malicious treatment
has broken her heart.

413
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:08,098
So, yes, she responded
by summoning our father.

414
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,834
Yes, that was a mistake.

415
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm not entirely sure that I can blame her.

416
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:19,542
I can.

417
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:25,882
Niklaus, so help me...

418
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:27,884
Are you really going to stand against me?

419
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:29,552
And not with that pathetic blade.

420
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:31,621
You'd just have to pull it out someday,

421
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:34,290
and then I'd hate you as I do her now.

422
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,693
If you want to protect Rebekah,

423
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,662
you'll need to use the white oak stake.

424
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:41,731
I don't have to listen to this nonsense.

425
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:45,001
Oh, don't pretend you
haven't thought about it.

426
00:20:45,003 --> 00:20:46,502
You look at me, and you see

427
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:49,172
everything you abhor in yourself.

428
00:20:49,174 --> 00:20:51,574
Sure, you dress it up with your fancy suits

429
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:54,544
and your handkerchiefs.

430
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:59,549
You with your mask of
civility and eloquence,

431
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:04,654
you're every bit the
abomination I am or worse.

432
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:09,258
Go on, Elijah. Go on.

433
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,261
Use the white oak stake.

434
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:20,870
I'm not so cowardly that I
have to kill you, Niklaus,

435
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:23,906
but if I have to make you
suffer to protect Rebekah,

436
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,043
that is what I will do.

437
00:21:28,879 --> 00:21:31,080
You see?

438
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,915
I knew you couldn't do it.

439
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,917
You still cling to the hope

440
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,619
that I can be redeemed,

441
00:21:36,621 --> 00:21:40,556
and if the bastard can be saved,

442
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:42,658
then maybe there's hope for you.

443
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,462
Aah!

444
00:21:46,464 --> 00:21:48,130
There.

445
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:50,900
Now you know how it feels.

446
00:21:50,902 --> 00:21:54,603
Aagh! Aah!

447
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,141
That was supposed to be my line.

448
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:04,647
Now I have this.

449
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:08,317
So I decide who lives and who dies.

450
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,264
I'm taking out that blade.

451
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,899
You'll have to kill me first,

452
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,434
and now you hold the means to do so.

453
00:22:22,436 --> 00:22:25,436
Why not finish what you
started a century ago?

454
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:28,506
I did not want you dead.
I wanted you to run.

455
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:30,942
Liar! You wanted revenge.

456
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:33,077
You drove me to betray you,

457
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,546
and now you want to twist it

458
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:35,914
and make it worse so you can justify

459
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,917
killing me instead of
accepting your own fault.

460
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,752
All I did was love your friend.

461
00:22:40,754 --> 00:22:43,721
You could've been happy for us,

462
00:22:43,723 --> 00:22:47,558
but instead in your paranoia,

463
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,627
you feared losing us both,

464
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:52,730
and, because of that, you did.

465
00:22:52,732 --> 00:22:57,502
There is no one else to blame, Nik,

466
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:00,204
only you.

467
00:23:00,206 --> 00:23:03,841
Where is Marcel now, hmm?

468
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:06,444
I thought he loved you,

469
00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:09,947
and yet he left you
trapped in here with me.

470
00:23:12,117 --> 00:23:14,619
Genevieve: The trouble with
the witches in this city

471
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,253
is, they lack direction.

472
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:20,024
Fortunately, our coven
has found a new leader...

473
00:23:20,026 --> 00:23:21,792
me.

474
00:23:21,794 --> 00:23:23,494
You ask a favor of me,

475
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:25,596
to lower Celeste's boundary spell,

476
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:27,598
but you don't control the witches anymore.

477
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,966
You want to help your people,

478
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,968
you need to broker peace,

479
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,636
a treaty with the vampires.

480
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:34,171
I can help.

481
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,273
The last time I arrived for a negotiation,

482
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,641
you tried to kill me.

483
00:23:37,643 --> 00:23:39,076
I learned my lesson...

484
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:40,611
if you can't beat them, make them an offer.

485
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,846
So here's the deal.

486
00:23:41,848 --> 00:23:45,015
You help me right now...
you have my word...

487
00:23:45,017 --> 00:23:46,884
vampires stay out of the Cauldron,

488
00:23:46,886 --> 00:23:49,286
no more executions.

489
00:23:49,288 --> 00:23:51,789
A nice start, but if you want my help

490
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:53,357
lowering that spell,

491
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:56,894
you're going to have to
give us Davina Claire.

492
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:01,465
Haven't your people
done enough to that girl?

493
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:04,368
You must know it's your
fault she suffered in death.

494
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,136
She was shunned by the ancestors

495
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:08,038
because of her alliance with you,

496
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,040
but all that's over.

497
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,775
Now we can welcome her home.

498
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,644
She will be revered by her people,

499
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:16,380
and I will teach her
how to control her power,

500
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:18,849
give her a home where she's safe,

501
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:22,386
not surrounded by vampires.

502
00:24:22,388 --> 00:24:24,655
Bring Davina to us,

503
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:28,158
and I'll find a way to
break Celeste's spell.

504
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,128
If not, well, let's just say

505
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,897
that I won't be the one to mourn Rebekah.

506
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,334
Klaus: You against me?

507
00:24:37,336 --> 00:24:38,802
It's hardly a fair fight, is it?

508
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:40,237
I mean, perhaps, if Marcel were here,

509
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:42,906
you'd stand a chance, but I expect

510
00:24:42,908 --> 00:24:45,642
he's already found another girl,

511
00:24:45,644 --> 00:24:48,245
no doubt younger and prettier.

512
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:50,046
You take joy in other people's pain,

513
00:24:50,048 --> 00:24:51,681
and then you wonder why I hate you.

514
00:24:51,683 --> 00:24:54,884
Yes, and that hatred led
you to do what you did.

515
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:56,820
Admit the truth.

516
00:24:56,822 --> 00:24:58,722
Admit you wanted me dead.

517
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:00,924
I wanted you to run... that is all...

518
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:02,525
despite your delusions.

519
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:04,194
Elijah lies suffering,

520
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,096
and I will allow you to help him.

521
00:25:06,098 --> 00:25:08,064
All you have to do is admit it.

522
00:25:08,066 --> 00:25:10,533
- You're insane.
- Yes! Yes!

523
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,836
I am a vicious, heartless monster,

524
00:25:12,838 --> 00:25:14,437
and so you summoned Mikael to kill me.

525
00:25:14,439 --> 00:25:15,905
- Admit it.
- It's not true.

526
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,407
You know what you did.

527
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:18,541
- Admit it.
- I didn't.

528
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:21,478
You wanted me dead!

529
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,381
Admit it.

530
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:35,558
Maybe I did.

531
00:25:40,464 --> 00:25:42,331
[Panting]

532
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,334
Nik...

533
00:26:01,563 --> 00:26:04,331
[Wind whistling]

534
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,918
You missed my heart.

535
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,687
Perhaps I did...

536
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:33,560
Or perhaps I never meant to kill you.

537
00:26:33,562 --> 00:26:35,729
Perhaps I just wanted
you to feel a fraction

538
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:39,566
the fear I felt when father came for me.

539
00:26:39,568 --> 00:26:42,802
Do you yourself know the truth?

540
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:44,871
I know this.

541
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,240
You accuse me of being evil,

542
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:49,676
and yet you are the one who conspired

543
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,911
to kill your own blood.

544
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:54,214
You made our lives a living hell.

545
00:26:54,216 --> 00:26:56,249
You tormented us.

546
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:58,752
I love my family...

547
00:26:58,754 --> 00:27:02,622
you, Elijah.

548
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:07,460
I loved all of you.

549
00:27:15,703 --> 00:27:18,238
I know I can be difficult,

550
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,441
but I did not make myself this way.

551
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:26,913
It was Mikael who ruined me.

552
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:30,116
He ruined me, too.

553
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:32,018
That's what you forget.

554
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,956
Centuries later,

555
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:39,492
each of us is broken...

556
00:27:39,494 --> 00:27:43,129
you with your anger and paranoia,

557

me with my fear of abandonment...

558
00:27:50,304 --> 00:27:52,672
and poor Elijah...

559
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:56,475
he dedicates himself

560
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:59,278
to everyone but himself.

561
00:28:01,915 --> 00:28:04,150
We are the strongest
creatures in the world,

562
00:28:04,152 --> 00:28:07,186
and yet was are damaged beyond repair.

563
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:11,524
We live without hope,

564
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:14,193
but we will never die.

565
00:28:17,264 --> 00:28:21,867
We are the definition of "cursed"...

How is she?

Depressed.

569
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:38,851
She needs real help, maybe a stay

570
00:28:38,853 --> 00:28:40,119
in an institution where she can get

571
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:41,653
round-the-clock care and medication.

572
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:43,689
No, no, no. She stays in a place like that,

573
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:44,690
she is never getting out.

574
00:28:44,692 --> 00:28:47,426
You have a better idea?

575
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,864
I could take her back to her people.

576
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:54,533
What?

577
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:56,835
There are bigger things
going on here, Cami.

578
00:28:56,837 --> 00:28:58,337
It's the only chance that she has.

579
00:28:58,339 --> 00:28:59,504
We have to talk about this.

580
00:28:59,506 --> 00:29:01,673
I'm not asking for permission.

581
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:23,829
Yaah!

582
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,764
Uh! Aah!

583
00:29:25,766 --> 00:29:28,600
Ugh...

584
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,136
Now we're even.

[Trumpet playing]

586
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:44,973
So we have a deal?

587
00:29:44,975 --> 00:29:46,308
Davina is asleep.

588
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,676
When she wakes up, I'll explain everything.

589
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:48,944
Then I'll bring her here.

590
00:29:48,946 --> 00:29:50,845
Meantime, we need to lower that barrier.

591
00:29:50,847 --> 00:29:52,781

592
00:29:52,783 --> 00:29:56,117
Fortunately for you, she's gone.

593

Her power bled back into the earth.

594
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:03,691
Now I can channel it, manipulate it.

595
00:30:03,693 --> 00:30:05,527
It'll take some doing,

596
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,228
but then, I'm pretty good at what I do.

597
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,963
One more thing,

598
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,999
I need you to fix the priest.

599
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:13,968
Sorry.

600
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,304
A hex like that, if it's
had time to take root,

601
00:30:16,306 --> 00:30:18,306
there's no undoing it.

602
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:21,276
Fine. Just get Rebekah out.

603
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,579
I'll have to undo the entire spell.

even if Klaus is free, if
you hurt Davina in any way...

608

Marcel, it's over. You lost.

609

What's done is never done.

620

It remains within us,

621
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,537
a story we tell ourselves

622
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:26,440

00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:02,586
and speaking of your child,

729
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:05,121
our family has no shortage of enemies.

730
00:40:05,123 --> 00:40:07,157
She will inherit all of them.

731
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:10,126
Please be careful.

732
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:16,599
You know you can always
come back and visit.

733
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,302
I've been known to keep a
secret or two from Klaus.

734
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:21,905
Well, if I can't,

735
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:23,673
you make sure to tell that little girl

736
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:26,509
stories of her crazy Auntie Bex

737
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:30,146
and let her know, despite my absence,

738
00:40:30,148 --> 00:40:32,982
I do love her very much.

739
