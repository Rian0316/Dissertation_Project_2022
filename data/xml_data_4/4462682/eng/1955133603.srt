1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
Previously on "Better Call Saul."

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,630
This is both strike one and strike two.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,030
Howard can't just stick you in doc review

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,560
because of something I did.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,810
I told you this would happen.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,730
I screwed up!

7
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,100
That came from a bullet!

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,620
That's it, we're getting you and Kaylee out of this house.

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,690
Wallet!

10
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,030
Let go!

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,660
That all you got?

12
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,380
What did I do that was so wrong?

13
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,690
You're like an alcoholic who refuses to admit he's got a problem.

14
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,940
Come on down, chuck!

15
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,150
Roll around in the dirt with me!

16
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,720
- Wonderful. - ‭Are the leeks too overpowering?

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,860
Not at all.

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,910
That's as good ‭as the one we had in Florence.

19
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,400
- All right, don't humor me. ‭- I'm not.

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,810
How was rehearsal?

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,790
Did what's-her-name behave herself?

22
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:42,410
She takes the whole section for granted.

23
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm debating ‭whether to say something.

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,730
I think you should, absolutely.

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,140
Don't keep it inside.

26
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,530
Ready for the chiffonade?

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah. Thanks.

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,020
And after all, if she's compromising the work...

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,650
Mm. Well, it's debatable.

30
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,180
I mean, the Schubert is coming along nicely.

31
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,180
It's more about morale.

32
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,060
Morale can affect quality.

33
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,850
God knows the hoops that Howard jumps through

34
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,350
- just to keep the troops humming. - ‭Well, true.

35
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,980
You deserve a medal for this.

36
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,520
Please. It's no big deal.

37
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,950
Your soy-ginger marinade?

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,240
Well, I found a citrus one that looked good,

39
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,880
so I thought I would try that.

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,790
Well, anyway, you are a trouper.

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,190
I apologize in advance.

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,240
Let's just say he's... something of an acquired taste.

43
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,190
Oh, how bad can he be?

44
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,700
Well, just in case, let's have a high sign.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,110
How about ‭the old Carol Burnett thing?

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, where she pulls her earlobe?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,990
Exactly.

48
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,900
You do this, and I'll say I have briefs to read,

49
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,960
- and we'll get rid of him. - All right. Whatever you want.

50
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,430
You know why she did that -- Carol Burnett?

51
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,180
It's a great story.

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,560
It was a signal to her grandmother,

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,630
who had raised her, as --

54
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,760
Seriously?

55
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,630
He's early.

56
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,250
You're a doll.

57
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,670
Holy shit. Look at this place.

58
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,250
Hey, Jimmy, thanks for coming.

59
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,810
Bring it on in here.

60
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,310
Hey! ‭Little taste of home for you.

61
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,830
Had to look all over town to find a place that had it.

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,450
‭Didn't have time to wrap it.

63
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,670
Well, thanks.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,770
You're good.

65
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,280
Yeah.

66
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,600
I'm looking for a place.

67
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,530
Been staying at the Ramada.

68
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,040
And thanks for the help, by the way.

69
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,420
I've found a few that I like.

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,360
This one place, ‭the beachcomber, has a pool.

71
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,570
And since the Mcgill clan

72
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,090
is whiter ‭than a pack of albino rats...

73
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,950
‭...I figure I better start working on my tan.

74
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,770
So, seriously considering that option.

75
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,390
I strongly suggest sunscreen.

76
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,070
We're up about 5,000 feet here.

77
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,270
You'll fry.

78
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,270
Excellent point. Sunscreen -- check.

79
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,160
So... A violinist?

80
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,910
And according to Chuck, a crazy talented one at that.

81
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,880
Mm. ‭I mean, wow.

82
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,570
Well, Chuck is very gracious.

83
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,050
She's being modest.

84
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,160
Rebecca is widely respected amongst her peers.

85
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,420
‭Yo-yo Ma came to our wedding.

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,260
That's, um...

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,390
Right on, man.

88
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,200
About the wedding, um,

89
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,180
I've been meaning ‭to apologize...about that.

90
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,220
- I am truly sorry I wasn't... - No worries, please.

91
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,400
So, tell us about your first week at Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

92
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,770
It was great.

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,670
I mean, they got me working in the mailroom, which

94
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,990
you gotta start somewhere.

95
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,220
I learned how to use the Xerox machine,

96
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,280
which is surprisingly complicated.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,250
I mean, press a button, a piece of paper spits out --

98
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,880
Not anymore. ‭Mm.

99
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,390
Thing's practically a computer.

100
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,400
It's like goddamn space shuttle.

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,410
It's got, like, double-sided printing, automatic stapling, you know?

102
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,580
Met some nice folks -- guys and gals.

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,860
Well, gal -- singular, actually.

104
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,020
Learned everyone's name, and I licked a ton of stamps.

105
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,430
My tongue is like hamburger meat -- I mean, seriously.

106
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,750
Yeah?

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,100
I got -- thing's raw as hell.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,010
Then I found out ‭there's a sponge for that.

109
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,340
Oops! Rookie mistake.

110
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,290
Well, it sounds like you had a very productive week.

111
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,240
Yeah, it was really great.

112
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,240
Hey, guys, um...

113
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,300
Um, I want to thank you for having me over.

114
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,230
This is, like, the best meal I've had in a decade.

115
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,590
I mean, the fish is perfection, and the, uh...

116
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,340
Risotto.

117
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,740
Risotto.

118
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,770
Thank you. That's very kind.

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,030
Well, you're a wonderful chef, you know?

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Aside from being super talented with the...

121
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,260
You got a good one, Chuck -- I mean, lucky, lucky man.

122
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,260
‭Well, ‭cheers to that.

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,200
Pardon me.

124
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,130
All right.

125
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,130
What's the difference between a vacuum cleaner

126
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,250
and a lawyer on a motorcycle?

127
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,560
The vacuum cleaner ‭has the dirt bag on the inside.

128
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,780
Aha, lawyer jokes.

129
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,220
I've only been in the mailroom a week,

130
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,510
and I've heard maybe a hundred.

131
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,550
Yeah. ‭It all comes ‭from a place of affection.

132
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,800
Sure. Of course.

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,890
What do you get when you cross the Godfather with a lawyer?

134
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,350
An offer you can't understand.

135
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,890
Very clever.

136
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,070
Never heard that one.

137
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,980
And believe me --

138
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,050
I have nothing but the utmost respect for your profession.

139
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,550
I mean, ‭it's the pillar of -- oh!

140
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,150
Why do they bury lawyers under 20 feet of dirt?

141
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,850
Because deep down, ‭they're really good people.

142
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,620
Uh, w-what do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 60?

143
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,780
"Your honor."

144
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,670
What's the difference between a tick and a lawyer?

145
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,310
Oh, no.

146
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,770
The tick falls off when you're dead! Bam!

147
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,710
Love that one.

148
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,850
You like that? Just joking.

149
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,700
I want you to know ‭how seriously I take my job.

150
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,300
I'm, uh, grateful for the -- oh.

151
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,730
How many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb?

152
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,220
Classic setup here.

153
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,020
Three -- one to climb the ladder, one to shake it,

154
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,110
And one ‭to sue the ladder company.

155
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,690
Comedy gold.

156
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,840
- I'm here all night! - More. Go, go.

157
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,690
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

158
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,350
Dessert, anyone?

159
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,270
We have a homemade blueberry crumble with vanilla ice cream.

160
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,370
Yeah, blueberry crumble -- sounds terrific.

161
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,950
I love a fruit-based, uh, blueberry --

162
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,300
- Wait. I think I know one. - Oh, bring it on.

163
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,070
Yeah, yeah.

164
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,340
Um, what do lawyers and sperm have in common?

165
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,960
Oh, just... ‭Um.

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,220
3 million -- no, wait.

167
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,210
Um, 1 in 3 million...

168
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,490
- have a chance ‭of becoming a human being. - Of becoming a human being.

169
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,540
Love that one.

170
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,740
Well, that went well, don't you think?

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,690
Sure. Thanks again.

172
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,270
I don't know ‭what you were worried about.

173
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,510
Jimmy's great.

174
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,390
Yeah. No, he's...

175
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,540
Yeah.

176
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,890
So, what's going on tomorrow?

177
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,770
Well, I've got the ‭Gernstetter deposition at 10:00,

178
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,820
Back-to-back partner meetings after lunch.

179
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,120
It shouldn't be a late one.

180
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,540
Thought any more about what's-her-name?

181
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,870
It's your reputation, too, you know?

182
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,750
Well, we start the Tchaikovsky on monday,

183
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,970
so I'll see what kind of mood she's in when we wrap.

184
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,890
Smart.

185
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,600
What do you call 25 attorneys buried up to their chins in cement?

186
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,610
- Not enough cement. - ‭What?

187
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,140
Hello. You've reached the voicemail of Kim Wexler.

188
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,090
Please leave me a message,

189
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,790
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

190
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,550
It's me again.

191
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,820
Look, I think I found something that could help get you outta there.

192
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,320
I'm gonna make things right.

193
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,930
Call me, would you?

194
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,710
Hi.

195
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,020
Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

196
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,570
- I just thought everyone was gone. ‭- Nope.

197
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,910
I'm here late most nights.

198
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,980
By the way, ‭i noticed in your office...

199
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,420
You threw away a soda can.

200
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,560
You're going through my trash?

201
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,330
No.

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,550
I was just dropping off papers at lunchtime,

203
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,430
and I happened to notice it in your trash can.

204
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,200
I fished it out, so it's fine.

205
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,170
Office cans ‭are for recyclable paper --

206
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,310
there's a separate big can in the kitchen for plastic,

207
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,600
glass, and aluminum.

208
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,950
We take our ecological footprint pretty seriously here.

209
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,410
okay, so, the big can

210
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,100
is where I should throw my empty Scotch bottles.

211
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,830
No, I-I get it.

212
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,210
Go green.

213
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,460
Good. Was there anything else?

214
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,390
Yeah, one quick thing.

215
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,410
I have the brief you gave Cliff this morning --

216
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,650
the plaintiff's opposition to the defendant's motion?

217
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,580
I have a few notes.

218
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,940
I think they're pretty clear,

219
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,520
but it's probably easier if we just go over them together.

220
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,880
Jesus. Th-those are Cliff's?

221
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,210
No, they're my notes.

222
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,340
I'd love go to over them now, if you have a minute.

223
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,670
It looks worse than it is.

224
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,150
It's -- it's just that we have a particular house style.

225
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,020
Okay, no offense,

226
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,420
But, uh, you're a second-year associate, right?

227
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,990
- Yep. ‭- And I came in as a fourth-year.

228
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,900
That's right.

229
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,160
So, why is a second-year giving notes to a fourth-year?

230
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,750
Well, like I said, I know the house style.

231
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,910
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?

232
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,760
No.

233
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,490
This is just one associate helping another.

234
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,880
Like here, ‭the Roman numeral headings --

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,430
we use all caps for those.

236
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,910
And you indented them, which is perfectly fine,

237
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,700
but Cliff likes them centered.

238
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,820
Oh, and before I forget,

239
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,370
we put two spaces after a period on all our documents.

240
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:36,970
I know it seems like a minor thing,

241
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,660
but really looks so much cleaner on the page.

242
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,870
You went a tad overboard with the quotations.

243
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,770
It's okay to present a quote from a controlling legal opinion,

244
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,110
but when you use too many,

245
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,540
it disrupts ‭the flow of your argument,

246
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,240
and it gives the impression

247
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,070
you don't know how to write an argument of your own.

248
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,720
‭And I'm sure you do, so...

249
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,390
‭You have a tendency to overuse the words "Clearly" and "Obviously."

250
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,630
Again, it's a matter of personal opinion --

251
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,750
I really appreciate this, Erin,

252
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,190
But, uh, ‭I was just on my way out.

253
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,750
So, if we could continue this first thing tomorrow morning...

254
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,960
Well, I was thinking we should just get 'er done now.

255
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,250
No time like the present.

256
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,720
Sure.

257
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,470
Let's roll up our sleeves and apply a little elbow grease.

258
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,180
Great!

259
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,050
So, I'm gonna get my favorite pen,

260
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,410
and I will see you momentarily.

261
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,510
You got it.

262
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,360
Uh, Miss Wexler?

263
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,200
You can call me Kim.

264
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,570
Kim, it's 20 to midnight.

265
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,650
Are you asking me if you can leave?

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,530
Guys, I'm not your supervisor.

267
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,060
Don't stick around on my account.

268
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,740
You coming, Kim?

269
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,080
Right behind you.

270
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,400
Just finishing up this last one.

271
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,160
Again, thanks.

272
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,190
Hey, Gesualdo, could you skip vacuuming tonight, please?

273
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,680
Five minutes -- just give me five minutes.

274
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,730
Here's how we're gonna handle this travesty of justice.

275
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,260
Wexler vs. Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill --

276
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,620
You want me to sue my own firm?

277
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,000
Filing's all typed up. It's ready to go.

278
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,720
This is not my area of expertise, all right?

279
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,080
So, first order of business --

280
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,310
we get a great employment-law attorney.

281
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:53,950
Show 'em we mean business.

282
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,050
‭Come on.

283
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,490
Hey, look at you. ‭

284
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,440
Okay, you're here at midnight in this glorified cellblock

285
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,410
busting your ass -- for what?

286
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,110
It has nothing to do with your performance.

287
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,410
You're being mistreated.

288
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,270
Chuck is punishing you to get to me.

289
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:11,500
This is extortion, pure and simple.

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,040
No, that's Howard, ‭who has an image to uphold.

291
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,010
He did the same thing after the Kettleman fiasco,

292
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,070
and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

293
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,950
I'm telling you -- Chuck is behind this.

294
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,500
No, you are behind this.

295
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,410
I told you this would happen, and now I'm paying the price.

296
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,390
I shoulda known better.

297
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,610
So now I'm keeping my head down, and I'm getting through this.

298
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,910
And I'm most certainly not suing HHM.

299
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,040
- Kim - Even if I won, who would hire me?

300
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,450
That would be career suicide.

301
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,630
All right.

302
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,660
Then I quit Davis & Main.

303
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,180
What does that accomplish?

304
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,690
It's the only way to get you outta dutch

305
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,240
because this is about Chuck,

306
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,870
whether you want to believe it or not.

307
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,700
I give him what he wants -- he lets up on you.

308
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,170
My knight in shining armor.

309
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,240
That is some sacrifice --

310
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,230
Quitng a job that you've been trying to tank since day one.

311
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,470
That's not true.

312
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,150
I dig myself out of this hole.

313
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,800
You do your job, Jimmy.

314
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,840
Prove you can go one week -- hell, one day --

315
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,600
without breaking the rules of the New Mexico Bar Association

316
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,130
or pissing off your boss.

317
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:22,610
And don't insult my intelligence

318
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,160
by saying you are doing any of this for me.

319
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,100
You don't save me.

320
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,200
I save me.

321
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,960
Just please go.

322
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,260
Hey, is Erin in yet?

323
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,490
God damn pixie ninja.

324
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,850
I owe you a big apology.

325
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,060
I have a medical condition --

326
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,750
Gerd, ‭gastroesophageal reflux disease.

327
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,530
I know -- it's a mouthful, right?

328
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,410
It affects ‭the lower esophageal sphincter.

329
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,190
I took a risk yesterday at lunch with some onion rings,

330
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:30,860
and last night --

331
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,160
Are we doing this or not?

332
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,080
You bet.

333
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,990
Hey, Jerry. It's Kim Wexler.

334
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,600
How's things with the alumni group?

335
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,930
Top 50?

336
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,770
Go, UNM law!

337
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,900
Hey, wondering if you've heard that Santa Fe place

338
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,990
is looking for new outside counsel.

339
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,090
They should really be considering

340
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,750
Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill. We --

341
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,940
Must've just been a rumor.

342
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,670
Yeah, let's grab a drink soon.

343
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,110
You too. Okay, bye.

344
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,860
Hey, uh, I remember you mentioned

345
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,180
your brother worked in Intel's legal department.

346
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,150
I'm an attorney at Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

347
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,740
Would you happen to know

348
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,910
if Intel is happy with their legal representation?

349
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,530
That's -- that's flattering,

350
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,430
but I'm seeing someone at the moment, so...

351
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,250
you know what?

352
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,570
Just call the main number, and they'll find me.

353
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,830
Yeah, no, we had drinks a few days ago.

354
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,850
And she said you had a friend who...

355
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,720
Oh, so they already settled.

356
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,650
I heard you ended up at harvard law.

357
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,840
Yeah, yeah, she was my roommate.

358
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,140
Listen, uh, I'an attorney at Hamlin, Hamlin, Mcgill.

359
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,170
We're actually known for teaming with other firms on large contracts.

360
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,870
Schweikart?

361
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,960
Sure. Yeah, I know them well. It's a great firm.

362
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,810
We met at that ABA mixer last year.

363
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,640
Yep, bourbon shots. That was me.

364
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:04,110
well, congrats on landing that Honeywell contract --

365
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,640
Huge amount of work.

366
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,550
You, too.

367
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,030
- How was your lunch? - ‭Good.

368
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,380
What'd you have? ‭Uh, turkey wrap.

369
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,890
How's the place?

370
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,760
It's great.

371
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,510
It's safe, quiet.

372
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,650
They allow dogs.

373
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,550
I can't ask for more than that.

374
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,830
I can't get Kaylee out of the pool.

375
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,970
By the end of the day, she's a prune.

376
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,780
‭I'm glad she's enjoying it.

377
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,510
Hey, I better get her dinner started soon.

378
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,760
Go to the restaurant.

379
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,140
No, it's too expensive. I have groceries in the room.

380
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,010
Oh, don't worry about that.

381
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,110
- Take her out. ‭- Thanks, Mike.

382
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,710
She misses you.

383
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,240
Do you think you might come by later?

384
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,890
Oh, not yet.

385
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,900
I don't want her to see me lookin like this.

386
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,870
How bad was it?

387
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,340
Well, I can tell ya the next car I get's gonna have airbags.

388
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:31,290
Well, ‭whenever you feel you're ready.

389
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,240
Ah, it's okay. ‭It looks worse than it is.

390
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,160
You give Kaylee a kiss for me.

391
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:36,950
I will.

392
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,560
All right. Bye, darlin.

393
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,000
Hold up.

394
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,700
What the hell happened to you?

395
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,560
I get it -- the first rule of fight club, right?

396
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,200
Uh, let me introduce you.

397
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,470
This is my babysitter, Erin.

398
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:55,280
Erin, this is my grandpa, Mike.

399
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,280
Nice to meet you.

400
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:10,680
Thanks, Tim.

401
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,260
Good seein you, Jimmy.

402
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,400
Listen, this clerk and I go way back.

403
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,550
We're like this.

404
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,180
But she needs a little finessing, so can I handle it?

405
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,070
Yeah, sure.

406
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,530
Surprise!

407
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,780
Bet you never thought you'd see me again.

408
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,590
I need a summary judgment hearing

409
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:30,320
with Michaelis for Bray v. O'Connell,

410
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,520
And I'm hopin for Thursday at 10:00, before he, uh...

411
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,440
Don't have it.

412
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,230
Thursday at noon, perhaps?

413
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,210
Nope.

414
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,340
Thursday at 2:00 -- now, that's my final --

415
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,730
You're pretty.

416
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,450
Will you be my new mommy?

417
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,540
What are you doing?!

418
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,880
- What? ‭- That's a bribe.

419
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,360
It's a gift.

420
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,890
That's how it works here --

421
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,730
grease the wheels of justice.

422
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,720
- Give me -- - That's not how it works.

423
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,340
You submit the paperwork, and you get a date -- period.

424
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,390
What don't you understand about finessing?

425
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,890
I apologize for my colleague.

426
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,150
She's new.

427
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,960
Is there any possible way we could still get Thursday?

428
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,570
I'll give you 2:30 Thursday.

429
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,640
The 14th.

430
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,110
That's next month.

431
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,070
We'll take it.

432
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,590
So, does this go ‭on my official stasi report?

433
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,770
I'm not trying to get you in trouble --

434
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,540
I'm trying to keep you out of it.

435
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,100
I'm gonna hit the men's room.

436
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,140
The men's room.

437
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,270
Hey, how you doing, Bill?

438
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,160
How am I doing? How are you?

439
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,900
Oh, you know, hanging in.

440
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,820
Yeah, word on the street is you're over at Davis & Main now.

441
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,460
You lucky son of a bitch.

442
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,330
Ah, you know, dancing with the devil.

443
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,940
So, how are things ‭at the district attorney's--

444
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,380
Davis & main!

445
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,060
Man, that must be sweet!

446
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,040
Give you a car?

447
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,010
Bet they gave you a car.

448
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,520
Yeah. They gave me a car.

449
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
- What kind? - ‭It's a --

450
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,600
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know.

451
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,540
I bet it's German. Is it German?

452
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,270
Yeah, it's German.

453
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,130
Uh, the cup holder's actually --

454
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,430
You have a sick office?

455
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,510
I bet you have a sick office.

456
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,070
Pretty sick.

457
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,810
It's got a little fireplace.

458
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,990
Fireplace?

459
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,360
I'd kill my mother for a fireplace.

460
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,330
Hell, I'd kill her for a window.

461
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,220
You, uh, you have an assistant, right?

462
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,150
Don't tell me -- is she hot?

463
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,120
She's hot, right?

464
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
She is a bright young man named omar.

465
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,620
Omar.

466
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,550
Hey, you got a little something on your, uh...

467
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,320
That's vomit...Again.

468
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,550
The worst part --

469
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,990
Could've come ‭from two different defendants.

470
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,960
Scumbags. They're all scumbags.

471
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,410
Oh, my god. Where you living? They put you up?

472
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,990
It's a corporate apartment. It's just --

473
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,210
Ah, no, don't tell me.

474
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,490
Christ.

475
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,410
Ah, damn it. I gotta run.

476
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,430
I'm putting away ‭some brain-dead suck wad...

477
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,870
who tried to rob a library.

478
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,600
Good seeing you, Bill.

479
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,180
Have a great day.

480
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,110
Lucky bastard.

481
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,550
Hello. Hi.

It's Kim Wexler.

483
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:12,660
I did leave a message, and I was just...

484
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,770
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,750
Sorry to bother you.

486
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,680
Hi. This is Kim Wexler.

487
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,230
I was looking for Carolyn Lipitz.

488
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,890
No, not his secretary. I'm an attorney.

489
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,500
Yes, I did -- I got your number from Chris.

490
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,240
Sure. I will let them know.

491
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,110
Okay. Nope, got it.

This is Kim Wexler from Hamlin Hamlin & Mcgill.

494
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,480
Actually -- hey -- can I just --

495
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,400
Would you tell him I'll call him right back?

496
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,490
Okay. Just let me know when is a good time.

497
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,930
Got it.

This is Kim Wexler.

503
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,150
I was looking for a Jillian Kogan.

504
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,400
I met you last year at an ABA mixer.

505
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,550
You know I have a fear of heights.

506
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,280
Keep coming every summer.

507
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,680
All right, just give me a call. Great.

508
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,630

509
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,570
Okay. I totally get it.

Kim wexler. Hey. How are you, Paige?

511
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,860
You did?

512
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,450
That's -- that's so nice to hear.

513
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:10,100
I thought we hit it off, as well.

514
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,260
Really?

515
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:16,180
I --

516
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I, uh, I-I couldn't be more thrilled.

517
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,090
It -- I mean, the firm and I.

518
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,480
Absolutely. I'll tell him right now.

519
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,150
I'm sure we can get something on the books tomorrow --

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,540
Day after, at the latest.

521
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,380
Thank you, Paige.

522
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,010
Me, too. Okay, bye.

523
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,670
Yes!

524
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,020
- There she is. ‭- Hi.

525

Uh, Paige, Kevin, this is Howard Hamlin, our senior partner.

We're thrilled ‭to have you folks here.

533

Kevin, true story -- when I was 7 years old,

534
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,120
my very first bank account was at Mesa Verde,

535
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,130
if you ‭can believe it.

536
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:47,460
I can. Mine was, too, back when my dad ran the place.

537
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,340
I can remember ‭the cover of my first passbook.

538
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,310
- It was a silhouette of a... - Cowboy.

539
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,610
Cowboy on horseback, yes, standing next to a cactus.

540
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,300
I loved that cowboy.

541
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,760
Far as I was concerned, I was saving up for that horse.

542
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:02,880
What the heck else is money good for when you're 7 years old?

543
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,960
So, we have ‭a little presentation for you

544
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,000
in our conference room, along with some snacks

545
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,970
and a soymilk latte with your name on it.

546
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,920
This one -- she's a keeper.

547
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,810
Shall we?

548
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,780
Let's do it.

549
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,220
Well, I think that ‭couldn't have gone any better.

550
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,890
- Pleasure to meet you. - ‭Fantastic. I'll see you soon.

551
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,240
Thanks for setting this up. Talk to you soon.

552
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,840
Lovely to meet you, Paige.

553
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,560
Congratulations.

554
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,900
Right back at you.

555
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:58,840
I'll circle back with Paige, get the ball rolling,

556
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,230
start talking strategy, you know?

557
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,980
Maybe...put together a list of staff associates we can put on this.

558
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,480
I'll put Francis on that.

559
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,290
You've got enough on your plate in doc review.

560
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,800
Coming.

561
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,800
Catch you at a bad time?

562
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,560
Not at all. Come in.

563
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,610
I hear clinking.

564
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,990
Does that mean ‭we have something to celebrate?

565
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,910
We sure do.

566
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,930
What are we drinking to?

567
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,460
Got a juicy one for you.

568
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,100
- Mesa Verde? - ‭On retainer.

569
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,430
Oh, even better.

570
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,750
Congratulations.

571
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,780
One of your golf-course conquests?

572
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,720
Kim Wexler brought them in.

573
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,560
Fourth-year associate snags a quarter of a million in billings?

574
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,120
She's probably having a couple of drinks herself.

575
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,370
She's out of the doghouse, I assume?

576
00:34:32,910 --> 00:34:33,940
We'll see.

577
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,640
Interstate expansion -- it's a complex case.

578
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,470
That's two, maybe three regulatory commissions we'll be dealing with

579
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:51,730
Months of work for HHM, maybe years.

580
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,650
Good morning, Rudolpho.

581
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,870
Good morning, Mr. McGill.

582
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,240
Oh, sorry.

583
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,510
I didn't know anyone was here.

584
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,340
Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff.

585
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,550
You're in early.

586
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,740
More like late.

587
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:48,200
Well, regardless of the hour, good to see you here.

588
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,910
Yeah, ‭I'm trying something new.

589
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,330
I'm coming in, working until 9:00.

590
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,690
It's easier before the place opens,

591
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,770
without all the lights and the phones ringing.

592
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,160
How about some coffee?

593
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,760
No, thank you.

594
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,800
W-would you mind making me some?

595
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,340
I apologize.

596
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,610
It's just I-I can't do it myself,

597
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,450
what with the electricity.

598
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,400
- Sure. ‭- No sugar.

599
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,270
Just a splash of soy milk.

600
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,490
I think we have it.

601
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,030
Kim?

602
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,070
Um, make two cups.

603
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,670
Well, I guess it's true what they say --

604
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,080
The early bird gets the worm, which is good if you like worms.

605
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,660
May I ask you a question?

606
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,800
Of course.

607
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,230
Do I have a future at this firm?

608
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,500
We have a lot in common, you and I.

609
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,760
My brother left you holding the bag.

610
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,540
If it makes you feel any better,

611
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:16,570
you're not the first person to go out on a limb for him.

612
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,700
I made the same mistake over and over again.

613
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,020
And now Howard has...

614
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,350
And he blames you.

615
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,960
It's a damned mess.

616
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,250
Jimmy ever tell you anything about our father?

617
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,640
Not much, no.

618
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,790
My dad -- our dad -- he was --

619
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:52,270
well... the personification of good.

620
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,080
I'm not sure he could even see sin in any form,

621
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,230
like he was born without the gene.

622
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,800
He ran a little corner store in Cicero --

623
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,330
cigarettes behind the counter, penny candy --

624
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,870
nothing special, ‭but it kept food on the table.

625
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,440
And the neighborhood loved dad.

626
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,050
He knew everybody's name, what was going on in their lives.

627
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,570
This little corner -- he made it better.

628
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,440
I was named after him.

629
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,760
Before that, he'd worked for a lot of people over the years,

630
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,470
and his dream was to be his own boss --

631
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,560
put everything he had into that place.

632
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,920
I was away at college when he put Jimmy to work there.

633
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,570
Jimmy grew up in that store, watching our father.

634
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:54,440
But dad was not the world's greatest businessman,

635
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,900
and eventually, ‭he ran into money troubles.

636
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,080
I, um, ‭had a clerkship at the time,

637
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,400
but I came home to help him get his books in order,

638
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,810
set the ship straight.

639
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,710
Now, I'm no accountant,

640
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:12,690
but I discovered $14,000 was just gone.

641
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,960
Vanished over the years.

642
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,340
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered it in dribs and drabs --

643
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,790
just took it out of the till.

644
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,440
My dad wouldn't hear it.

645
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:32,480
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

646
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,690
He ended up having to sell.

647
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,220
Six months later, he was dead.

648
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,870
At the funeral, ‭no one cried harder than Jimmy.

649
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,130
My brother is not a bad person.

650
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,680
He has a good heart.

651
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,490
It's just...

652
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,170
...he can't help himself.

653
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,170
And everyone's left picking up the pieces.

654
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,140
Is there any coffee left?

655
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,830
No, I got it.

656
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,500
I'll talk to Howard,

657
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,130
pour a little oil on troubled waters.

658
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:30,770
You're being wasted down in doc review.

659
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,480
Good job with Mesa Verde.

660
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,170
Mind if I join you?

661
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,370
Hi.

662
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,640
What can I get you?

663
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,300
Coffee -- black.

664
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,210
Coming right up.

665
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,160
He really did a number on you.

666
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,460
Sorry. I know you?

667
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,390
The young man who did that to you.

668
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,480
He's my nephew -- ‭hothead, always has been.

669
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:50,560
Kid thinks he's a boxer.

670
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:53,800
He should have shown you respect.

671
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,450
I apologize to you on behalf of my family.

672
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,090
Apology accepted.

673
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,100
And you know what?

674
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,630
He should go to jail -- best thing for him.

675
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,190
Teach him respect for his elders.

676
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,360
But... not for eight years --

677
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,730
less, much less.

678
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,060
You see what I'm getting at?

679
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,490
Not really.

680
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,550
The gun charge -- that's 8 years he's going away, maybe 10.

681
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,570
Aggravated assault, the gun, plus he got your wallet.

682
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,750
That's right.

683
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,860
I would like for you to tell the police

684
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,740
that the gun was yours.

685
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:05,670
Would you?

686
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,730
You're both ‭a little hot under the collar

687
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,380
about whether ‭you bumped his car or not.

688
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,490
But there was a scuffle, and, uh, he got your gun.

689
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,180
My gun?

690
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,120
Your gun from your pocket -- he got it,

691
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,280
and that's how his prints got on it.

692
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:28,230
And then I'd be subject to the gun charge.

693
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,010
You're an ex-cop.

694
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,240
They'll go easy on you.

695
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:37,040
So you're a psychic.

696
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,070
I'll even twist Tuco's ear, make him apologize.

697
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,210
And he serves for battery -- nothing else.

698
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:56,670
I'm looking for the best possible outcome for everybody.

699
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,430
And for your trouble...

700
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:05,420
you take home $5,000.

701
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,890
Think about it.
