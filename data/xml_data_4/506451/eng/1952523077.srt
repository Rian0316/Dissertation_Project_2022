1
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,881
Mr. Cretites?

2
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:28,455
...Paul Cretites.

3
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:29,456
My name is Latimer.

4
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,531
I've come to meet you,
Mr. Cretites.

5
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,228
Just come this way,
Mr. Cretites.

6
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,623
We have a carriage waiting.

7
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:40,294
During my long and
intimate acquaintance...

8
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,862
...with Sherlock Holmes,

9
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,965
I'd never heard him refer to his relations,

10
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,835
and hardly ever to his own early life.

11
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:50,971
Because of this reticence,
I sometimes found myself...

12
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,840
...regarding him as an
isolated phenomenon...

13
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,708
...as deficient in human sympathy...

14
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,293
...as he was pre-eminent in intelligence.

15
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,914
I'd come to believe that he was an orphan...

16
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,783
...with no relatives living.

17
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:06,198
But one day, to my very great surprise,

18
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,620
he began to talk to me about his family.

19
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,594
My singular gift of
observation introduction...

20
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,496
...may have come from my grandmother,

21
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,432
who was a sister of Bernais,
the French artist.

22
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,867
The art in the blood...

23
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,469
...is liable to take the strangest forms.

24
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:25,289
For example,
my brother, Mycroft.

25
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,207
Your brother?

26
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,112
I didn't know you had a brother?

27
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,947
Oh, yes.

28
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,249
And I can assure you,

29
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,118
he possesses a far greater faculty...

30
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,654
...of observation and deduction than I do.

31
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,390
Holmes, I know that you are a modest man

32
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,825
Ha-ha.

33
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,460
My dear Watson,

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,362
I cannot agree with those...

35
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:50,664
...that rank modesty among the virtues.

36
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:52,299
To the legation,

37
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,735
everything should be seen exactly as it is.

38
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,236
And to underestimate one's self...

39
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,005
...is as much a departure from the truth...

40
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,673
...as to exaggerate one's own ability.

41
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,308
What I have just told
you about my brother...

42
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,243
...is the exact and literal truth.

43
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:06,013
Well, naturally,
I don't doubt your word.

44
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,082
But if there is another man in England...

45
00:04:08,182 --> 00:04:09,817
...with such singular powers,

46
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,219
how is it that neither
the police nor the public...

47
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,974
...have ever heard of him,
let alone myself?

48
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,826
He's very well known in his own circles.

49
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,627
Where then?

50
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,163
The Diagones Club.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,599
It is the oddest club in London,

52
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,269
and my brother one of the oddest men.

53
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,747
I suppose you wish to meet him?

54
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,016
Well, of course I do,

55
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:47,554
even if it's just to prove that he exists.

56
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,461
Then you shall,
this afternoon.

57
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,964
He has come across the
most singular problem,

58
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,299
which he thinks might interest me.

59
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,368
But why does Mycroft not use...

60
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,537
...his great powers for detective work?

61
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,606
If the art of the detective began...

62
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,974
...and ended in reasoning
from an arm chair,

63
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,009
my brother would be the
greatest criminal agent...

64
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:10,644
...that ever lived.

65
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,513
What is to me a means of livelihood...

66
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,149
...is to him the merest hobby of a dilettante.

67
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:18,394
But he has no ambition and no energy.

68
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,156
What is his profession, then?

69
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:24,792
He has an extraordinary faculty for figures.

70
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:25,826
He audits the books...

71
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:29,496
...for some of the government departments.

72
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,499
But what are the qualifications...

73
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,901
...for the Diogenes Club?

74
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,469
Shyness and misanthropy...

75
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,671
...my brother is one of
the founding members.

76
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,606
It contains the most unsociable...

77
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,542
...and clubful men in time
who speak not a word...

78
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:45,379
...and shun even the merest glance.

79
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,613
Now, let us enter.

80
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:47,481
Yes, but...

81
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,581
Not a word.

82
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:46,938
Holmes, have you...

83
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:03,857
We can talk in here.

84
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,957
Well,
thank goodness.

85
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:23,027
Look at those two men, Sherlock.

86
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,214
What do you make of them?

87
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,849
The brilliant marker of the other.

88
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,917
Precisely.

89
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,318
What do you make of the other?

90
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:33,153
An old soldier,
I perceive.

91
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,655
And very recently distraught?

92
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,023
Served in India,
I see.

93
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,624
And a non-commissioned officer.

94
00:07:37,724 --> 00:07:38,892
Relativity,
I fancy.

95
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:40,160
And a widower?

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,096
With a child.

97
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:46,166
Children, my dear boy,
children.

98
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,468
Ha-ha.

99
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,569
Mycroft Holmes.

100
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,639
Glad to meet you,
Dr. Watson.

101
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,742
I hear of Sherlock everywhere...

102
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:56,844
...since you became his...

103
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:58,378
Well, thank you.

104
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,814
For anyone who wishes to study mankind,

105
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,250
this is the spot.

106
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,685
But surely you were taking things...

107
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,587
...a little too far just now?

108
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,255
It is not hard to say,
Watson,

109
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,857
that a man of that bearing,

110
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:10,924
and especially of authority...

111
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,993
...and some big skin as a soldier...

112
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,495
...is more than a private,

113
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,530
and is not long for India.

114
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,298
That is not long since left the service...

115
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:21,468
...shown by his still wearing
his ammunition boots,

116
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:22,970
as they're called.

117
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,620
He has not the cavalry stride,

118
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:27,441
but he wore his hat on one side...

119
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,410
...as is shown by the lighter skin...

120
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,612
...on one side of his brow.

121
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,615
His weight is against him being a sapper.

122
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,517
He is in the artillery.

123
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,852
There goes his complete
mourning shows...

124
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,587
...that he has lost someone very dear.

125
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,322
The fact that he's doing his own shopping...

126
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:44,158
...looks as though it was his wife.

127
00:08:44,258 --> 00:08:46,493
He's been buying things for children,

128
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,062
as you can see.

129
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,898
There is a wrap, which
shows that one of them...

130
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:53,000
...is very,
very young.

131
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,037
And the fact that he has
a picture book under his arm...

132
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,857
...shows there is another child.

133
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:04,244
Aha, Mr. Merlas.

134
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,314
Come in, sir.

135
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,922
These are my friends.

136
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,092
This is Dr. Watson,

137
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,930
and this is my younger brother, Sherlock.

138
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,999
You're Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

139
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,402
I've asked Mr. Merlas to step across.

140
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,671
He lodges on the first floor above me,

141
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,108
and I thought you'd be
interested in his story.

142
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,211
He's the reason why I
asked you to call today.

143
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,812
Mr. Merlas,

144
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,015
he came to me, well...

145
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,053
But I think I shall ask Mr. Merlas to tell...

146
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,389
...his own very remarkable experiences...

147
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:50,290
...in his own fashion.

148
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,390
Thank you,
Mr. Holmes.

149
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:56,797
For many years,

150
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,897
I have been the chief

151
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,601
Greek interpreter in London.

152
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:04,104
I do not think that the
police believe my story.

153
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,204
On my word,
I do not.

154
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,909
Just because they have
never heard of it before,

155
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,912
they think that such a thing cannot be.

156
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:15,783
But I know that I shall
never be easy in my mind...

157
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:19,686
...until I know what has
become of my poor man...

158
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,589
...with a sticking plastered up on his face.

159
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:25,125
Sticky...

160
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,694
Mr. Merlas,
please sit down.

161
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,464
Thank you, Mr. Holmes,
I prefer to stand.

162
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,564
Watson.

163
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,003
I am all attention.

164
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,344
All this happened only two days ago,

165
00:10:44,444 --> 00:10:46,613
on Monday night.

166
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,482
I am Greek by instruction.

167
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,851
And earn my living as an interpreter.

168
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:53,587
It often happens that I'm
sent for at strange hours...

169
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:55,856
...by foreigners who would
get into difficulties...

170
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:57,858
...or by travelers who would arrive late...

171
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,998
...and wish my services.

172
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,641
Mr. Merlas?

173
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,476
Yes?

174
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,512
I apologize for this intrusion,

175
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,280
but I need the services...

176
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,748
...of an interpreter immediately.

177
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,884
My name is Latimer.

178
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,819
Immediately?

179
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,888
I wouldn't insist unless it were urgent,

180
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,123
but a Greek friend of
mine has just arrived...

181
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,625
...in this country on business matter.

182
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,326
Unfortunately,
he speaks nothing...

183
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,928
...but his own tongue.

184
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,229
I likewise so.

185
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,831
Mr. Merlas, please.

186
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,566
My carriage is waiting outside.

187
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,605
How far away?

188
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,041
Only to Kensington.

189
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,533
I'm sorry to have to cut off
your view, Mr. Merlas,

190
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,702
but the fact is, I have no intention that you...

191
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,371
...should see the place
to which we are driving.

192
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,474
It might possibly be inconvenient to me...

193
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,276
...if you were able to find
your way back again.

194
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,646
This is very extraordinary
conduct, Mr. Latimer.

195
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:01,415
You must be aware that
what you're doing...

196
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:03,515
...is quite illegal.

197
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,886
It is somewhat of a liberty, no doubt,

198
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,366
but we'll make it up to you.

199
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,399
For nearly two hours,
we drove,

200
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:21,769
without my having the least
idea as to where I was.

201
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:24,004
Did you not notice any change...

202
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,873
...of sound under the wheels?

203
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,973
I listened,
Mr. Holmes.

204
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:31,311
Sometimes we seemed to
be on a paved causeway,

205
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,411
sometimes on asphalt,

206
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:36,116
but there was nothing
to tell me where I was.

207
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,885
And no other sounds...

208
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:41,054
...a ship's siren or church bell?

209
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:43,223
I'm sorry,
nothing like that.

210
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,191
At what time...

211
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,126
...did you finally reach your destination?

212
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:50,130
Ten minutes to 9:00,
exactly.

213
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,744
Is this Mr. Merlas,
Harold.

214
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:11,478
Yes.

215
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,881
Well done,
Ha Ha Ha,

216
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,981
well done.

217
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:20,721
No ill will, Mr. Merlas,
I trust,

218
00:15:20,821 --> 00:15:23,657
but we could not get on without you.

219
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:27,728
If you deal fair with us,
you'll not regret it,

220
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:31,231
but if you try any tricks,
God help you.

221
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,331
What do you want of me?

222
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,935
Only to ask a few questions...

223
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,438
...of a Greek gentleman who's visiting us,

224
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,306
and to let us have the answers.

225
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:42,209
But, you say no more than you are told,

226
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,879
or it were better you had never been born.

227
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,155
Mr. Merlas,
pray continue.

228
00:15:55,255 --> 00:16:01,662
Well then, this man,
this evil man,

229
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:04,865
showed me to a room
which appeared to be...

230
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,202
...very curiously furnished.

231
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:13,740
But again, the only light
was afforded by a single lamp,

232
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:15,841
half turned down.

233
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,372
The slate, Harold.

234
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:53,345
Are his hands loose?

235
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,126
Take this.

236
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:16,236
You will ask the questions, Mr. Merlas,

237
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:19,339
and he will write the answers.

238
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,775
Ask him,
first of all,

239
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:26,313
whether he's prepared to sign the papers?

240
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,749
'Never.'

241
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,692
On no conditions?

242
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,276
He writes,
'only if I see her married...

243
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,980
...in my presence by a Greek
priest, whom I know.'

244
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,815
Ha Ha.

245
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:38,552
You know what awaits you, then?

246
00:18:50,764 --> 00:18:55,969
He says, 'I care nothing for myself.'

247
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,605
And so it went on,
again and again

248
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,241
I had to ask him whether he would give in...

249
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,143
...and sign the document.

250
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:07,681
Again and again, I had
the same indignant reply.

251
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:12,753
But soon,
a thought came to me.

252
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,589
I took to adding on little
sentences of my own...

253
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,344
...to each question,
innocent ones at first,

254
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,929
to test whether either of our companions...

255
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,198
...knew anything of the matter.

256
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:26,900
And then, as I found that
they showed no sign,

257
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,672
I played a more dangerous game.

258
00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:41,381
This obstinacy is doing you no good.

259
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,237
He says,
'I care not.'

260
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:13,781
In fact, he had also told me...

261
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,116
...he was a stranger in London.

262
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,420
He then told me he had
been here three weeks,

263
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,155
and was being forcibly starved.

264
00:20:24,825 --> 00:20:27,528
Starved?

265
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:30,697
Did you manage to find out his name?

266
00:20:30,831 --> 00:20:32,366
Cretites.

267
00:20:32,466 --> 00:20:34,902
He was from Athens.

268
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:38,572
But that was all I could
discover, unfortunately.

269
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:39,339
Another five minutes,

270
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,941
and I should have wormed out...

271
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:44,411
...the whole story under their very noses.

272
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:48,215
Ask him again,
Mr. Merlas.

273
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,653
But at that instant,
the door opened,

274
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:57,825
and a woman stepped into the room.

275
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,426
He says, 'never.'

276
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,526
Well, ask him again.

277
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,700
Harold, I could not stay away any longer.

278
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,138
Sophia,
Sophia, Sophia.

279
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:31,925
That will do,
Mr. Merlas.

280
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,097
As you perceive,

281
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:41,468
we have taken you into our confidence...

282
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,543
...over some very private business.

283
00:21:48,876 --> 00:21:53,814
Here are five sovereigns,
which will, I hope,

284
00:21:53,947 --> 00:21:55,649
be a sufficient fee.

285
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:59,753
But remember, if you speak
to anyone about this,

286
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:05,759
one human soul,
mind, well,

287
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:12,399
may God have mercy on your soul.

288
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:39,226
As before, I was taken
in a closed carriage...

289
00:22:39,326 --> 00:22:42,029
...for almost two hours.

290
00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:47,835
There I was abandoned, as
I was later to discover,

291
00:22:47,935 --> 00:22:50,204
near Wentsworth Common.

292
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,555
I did not know where I had been,

293
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:11,358
nor whom I had spoken with nor anything,

294
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,838
saving what I have told you.

295
00:23:19,266 --> 00:23:21,835
But I know there is foul play going on,

296
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:24,571
and I want to help that unhappy man...

297
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:27,074
...before God, I do.

298
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,882
Mycroft.

299
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:12,953
Mycroft.

300
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:14,354
Huh?

301
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,124
What steps have you taken so far?

302
00:24:17,224 --> 00:24:20,594
Well, this was in all the daily papers:

303
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:23,897
'Anyone having information
as to the whereabouts...

304
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:26,967
...of a Greek gentleman
named Paul Cretites,

305
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:29,536
who cannot speak English,
will be rewarded.

306
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,472
As ever a reward will be paid to anyone...

307
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,540
...having information about a Greek lady,

308
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,542
whose first name is Sophia, '

309
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,642
but no answer as yet.

310
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,146
What about the Greek Legation?

311
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:40,180
I have tried.

312
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,315
They know nothing.

313
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,517
The head of the Athens police, then.

314
00:24:43,617 --> 00:24:49,089
Sherlock has all the energy in the family.

315
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:51,392
When you take up a case,
by all means,

316
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,761
let me know if you do any good.

317
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:55,129
Certainly.

318
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,229
Mr. Merlas, sir.

319
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:02,836
I should be extremely careful,

320
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:05,172
if I were you,
but of course,

321
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:07,241
through these advertisements,

322
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,656
they'll know that you've betrayed them.

323
00:25:53,353 --> 00:25:54,722
Whoops.

324
00:25:54,822 --> 00:25:57,591
On your way.

325
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,394
It seems to me obvious that
this Greek girl has been...

326
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,362
...carried off by the young Englishman,

327
00:26:02,462 --> 00:26:03,030
Harold Latimer.

328
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,898
Carried off from where?

329
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,266
Athens, perhaps?

330
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,968
No, no, no...
this Harold Latimer...

331
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,236
...cannot speak a word in Greek.

332
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:11,004
The girl speaks English fairly well,

333
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:13,741
inference that she has been
in England some little time,

334
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:16,391
and he has not been in Greece.

335
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,219
Thank you Miss Jackson.

336
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:29,857
Then, let's presume that the girl...

337
00:26:29,957 --> 00:26:32,259
...was visiting in England
and that this Harold...

338
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:34,061
...persuaded her to fly with him.

339
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,396
That is more probable.

340
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:38,332
Then the brother, that
must be the relationship,

341
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,501
comes over from Greece
in order to intervene,

342
00:26:40,601 --> 00:26:41,702
they see him,

343
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:45,372
use violence to force him
to sign some documents,

344
00:26:45,472 --> 00:26:47,574
making over the girl's fortune to them.

345
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:49,510
He's probably the trustee.

346
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,212
This, as we have heard,
he refuses to do.

347
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,380
So far.

348
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,516
But these men will not stop now.

349
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,718
Whatever happens, Watson,
we must find them.

350
00:26:57,818 --> 00:26:59,153
How can we?

351
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:01,922
Well, if our conjecture is correct,

352
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,425
and the girl's name is...
or was... Sophia Cretites,

353
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:06,960
we should have no difficulty in tracing her.

354
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,355
That must be our main hope.

355
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:13,339
The brother, of course,
is a complete stranger.

356
00:27:34,087 --> 00:27:35,456
Come in,
Sherlock.

357
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:36,824
Come in, sir.

358
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,293
You don't expect such energy
from me, do you, Sherlock...

359
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:40,728
...hmm?

360
00:27:40,828 --> 00:27:42,730
Now, How did you get here?

361
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,099
I passed you while you were
in the telegraph office.

362
00:27:45,199 --> 00:27:48,259
I had an answer to my advertisement.

363
00:27:48,302 --> 00:27:50,304
It came within a few
minutes of your leaving.

364
00:27:50,404 --> 00:27:51,939
And what effect?

365
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,844
It is written with a Jay
pen on royal cream paper...

366
00:27:56,944 --> 00:28:01,024
...by a middle-aged man
with a weak constitution.

367
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:04,318
'Sir, in answer to your
advertisement of today's date,

368
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,920
I beg to inform you
that I know the young lady...

369
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,822
...in question very well.

370
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,924
If you should care to call upon me,

371
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,793
I could give you some particulars...

372
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,928
...as to her painful history.

373
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,898
She's at present at Memerkle's Beckinum.

374
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:21,034
Yours faithfully,
Jay Davenport.'

375
00:28:21,168 --> 00:28:23,203
He writes from Lower Brigestone.

376
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:25,672
Do you not think we
should drive there now...

377
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,374
...and learn these particulars?

378
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:28,976
My dear Mycroft.

379
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:31,111
Her brother's life is more important...

380
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,780
...than the sister's story.

381
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,581
But we should call at Scotland Yard...

382
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:35,349
...for Inspector Gregson...

383
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:37,885
...and then go straight out to Beckinum,

384
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:41,088
where we know that a man
is being done to death,

385
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:42,956
Every hour maybe vital.

386
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,893
Better pick up Mr. Merlas on the way?

387
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,528
Why?

388
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:51,028
Because we may need a Greek interpreter.

389
00:28:51,098 --> 00:28:53,400
Excellent, Watson.

390
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,703
I should say from what we have heard,

391
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,839
that we are dealing with...

392
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,659
...a particularly dangerous guy.

393
00:29:16,323 --> 00:29:17,725
Mr. Merlas?

394
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:18,759
Yes.

395
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,295
There's a gentleman
downstairs to see you, sir.

396
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:22,796
What gentleman?

397
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:27,231
Well, he said he met you
today at the Diogenes Club.

398
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:33,240
Mr. Holmes.
Thank you.

399
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:47,488
Good evening,
Mr. Merlas.

400
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:37,137
Good evening,
Mrs. Sterd,

401
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:40,107
Would you tell Mr. Merlas
I need to see him urgently.

402
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:42,176
Well, Mr. Merlas is not here, sir.

403
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:44,678
A gentleman just called for him, and he left.

404
00:30:44,778 --> 00:30:46,080
Can you tell me where?

405
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,448
Oh, I don't know,
sir.

406
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:48,549
All I know is,

407
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:50,651
he drove off with a gentleman in a carriage.

408
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,052
Did the gentleman give a name?

409
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:53,187
No, sir.

410
00:30:53,287 --> 00:30:55,656
He wasn't a tall,
handsome, dark, young man?

411
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:56,790
Oh, no, sir.

412
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,293
He was a little gentleman, with glasses,

413
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:02,763
thin in the face, but very
pleasant in his ways.

414
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,532
He was laughing all the time he was talking.

415
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:07,632
Thank you.

416
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,072
Scotland Yard,
and hurry.

417
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,120
It cannot be done without a warrant.

418
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,656
We are not disputing that, Inspector.

419
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,759
Even if they are criminals,

420
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:34,395
it is a private house and the law demands...

421
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:37,664
The law demands that we act quickly.

422
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:39,600
Can you not find a Magistrate...

423
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,535
...to sign this warrant for us?

424
00:31:41,635 --> 00:31:43,635
A this hour?

425
00:31:47,141 --> 00:31:49,209
At this very minute...

426
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:52,012
...our kidnapping could become murder.

427
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:55,449
I can but try.

428
00:31:55,549 --> 00:31:57,549
Please do.

429
00:32:10,197 --> 00:32:15,702
Tell him,
I have ceased being reasonable.

430
00:32:15,836 --> 00:32:19,373
If he does not sign the papers now,

431
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:22,409
I will kill him.

432
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:27,080
Tell him I have no more patience.

433
00:32:41,028 --> 00:32:43,028
No.

434
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:46,465
No.

435
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:52,370
No.

436
00:32:53,173 --> 00:32:55,173
No.

437
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:57,478
Please, Inspector...

438
00:32:57,578 --> 00:32:59,346
...will you not come without a warrant?

439
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:00,981
I am sorry, gentlemen...

440
00:33:01,081 --> 00:33:03,050
We have wasted nearly an hour.

441
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:06,653
The law cannot be hurried, Mr. Holmes.

442
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:12,259
The life of Mr. Merlas
is in your hands, Inspector.

443
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:23,003
Tell him... hmm...
tell him if I kill him...

444
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:27,200
...I have no use anymore...

445
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:31,278
...for his sister,
and she will die, also.

446
00:33:31,378 --> 00:33:32,212
But you wouldn't...

447
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,312
TELL HIM.

448
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,577
Here it is, gentlemen...
it's signed.

449
00:34:03,677 --> 00:34:05,012
Now get someone to drive us...

450
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:05,979
...to London Bridge Station.

451
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,289
I pray we're not too late.

452
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:43,050
A carriage heavily loaded with luggage...

453
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,552
...has passed that within the last half-hour.

454
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:47,652
Wait for us here.

455
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:19,553
The nest is empty and the birds are flown.

456
00:35:50,384 --> 00:35:52,384
It's sulfur.

457
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:55,789
Mycroft, get the lamp.

458
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:58,092
Come, help me with the bodies.

459
00:35:58,192 --> 00:36:00,192
Right.

460
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,708
Quick.

461
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:20,781
The poor wretch must be Paul Cretites.

462
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:23,684
No more, I'm afraid.
His life is over.

463
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:26,353
We should have been
here sooner, Inspector.

464
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:29,156
He must have been dead about four hours.

465
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,625
The gas made of sulfur,

466
00:36:31,725 --> 00:36:33,127
am I not right,
Dr. Watson?

467
00:36:33,227 --> 00:36:35,227
Beaten to death.

468
00:36:37,397 --> 00:36:39,133
But Mr. Merlas still lives.

469
00:36:39,233 --> 00:36:41,668
Quick. Let's get him out
of here as fast as possible.

470
00:36:41,768 --> 00:36:43,037
Inspector, brandy.

471
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:46,006
Relax, Mr. Merlas,
you're in safe hands.

472
00:36:46,106 --> 00:36:48,106
Get the ropes off him.

473
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:12,299
From a brief look at her room,

474
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:13,534
the lady left in haste,

475
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,502
but without a struggle.

476
00:37:15,602 --> 00:37:21,275
That man Latimer must still
have some power over her.

477
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:24,011
One wonders,

478
00:37:24,144 --> 00:37:27,581
with how much remorse
she abandoned her brother...

479
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,681
...for Harold Latimer?

480
00:37:29,716 --> 00:37:32,653
You still retain your low opinion of women?

481
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:37,057
In this instance,
I cannot maybe justify.

482
00:37:37,157 --> 00:37:44,498
Holmes, they appear to have
consulted a Bradshaw.

483
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,034
Look at this page.

484
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:55,307
The boat train.

485
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,789
The murderers won't get far.

486
00:37:57,811 --> 00:38:00,080
Have man at every port
in England, if need be.

487
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,417
The boat train makes one stop
between London and Dover.

488
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:09,723
At Hurn Hill in 23 minutes, precisely.

489
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:10,724
Exactly.

490
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,826
Stay with your chief witness, Inspector.

491
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:15,095
You may need a statement from him.

492
00:38:15,195 --> 00:38:16,997
And he will need your help.

493
00:38:17,097 --> 00:38:21,347
A little brandy, and ammonia
at frequent intervals.

494
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:44,625
Mycroft, I'm not built for running so hard.

495
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:23,297
Tickets, please.

496
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:27,392
Will you kindly have your
tickets ready, please?

497
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,106
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

498
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:34,374
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

499
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,377
Well, I've read about your cases, sir.

500
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:37,544
Are we the last passengers...

501
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:38,979
...from whom you have collected tickets?

502
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,647
Indeed, sir.

503
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:41,615
I always work at the engine, start there,

504
00:39:41,715 --> 00:39:43,283
and work my way back to the garden.

505
00:39:43,383 --> 00:39:44,551
Then you can help me.

506
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,987
There are three passengers,
two men and a woman,

507
00:39:47,087 --> 00:39:48,422
traveling together.

508
00:39:48,522 --> 00:39:50,257
They may not appear to be companions,

509
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:52,393
but they will be in a compartment alone.

510
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,062
The elder man wears thick-lensed glasses,

511
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:56,430
and the younger one is quite handsome.

512
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,098
They will have a great deal
of luggage marked...

513
00:39:58,198 --> 00:39:59,400
...for the Continent.

514
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,168
Have you seen such a party?

515
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,303
Yes, indeed, I can help you, Mr. Holmes.

516
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,772
I never doubted it.

517
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:05,939
There are two parties...

518
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:07,741
...who fit that description,
Mr. Holmes.

519
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,876
Two?

520
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:10,976
Ticket, please.

521
00:40:13,614 --> 00:40:15,916
In Compartment B4...

522
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:17,084
B4.

523
00:40:17,184 --> 00:40:18,519
...and D8.

524
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,120
Thank you,
Inspector.

525
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,656
How do you know which
two are the murderers?

526
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,326
It couldn't be simpler.
No, don't wake him.

527
00:40:26,326 --> 00:40:29,726
There's danger enough for the two of us.

528
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,987
A left-handed printer from Detford.

529
00:40:54,087 --> 00:40:56,657
His older brother drinks too much...

530
00:40:56,757 --> 00:40:59,307
...and is pained by his liver.

531
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:00,994
Can't harm mine then.

532
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:03,094
Whatever.

533
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:12,806
And the girl?

534
00:41:12,906 --> 00:41:14,475
She knows neither of them,

535
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,676
she's a machinist from Bradford...

536
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,910
...who's going on a Holiday...

537
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,612
...to find romance.

538
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:20,280
Which means,
undoubtedly,

539
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,695
the murderers aren't in Compartment B4.

540
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,322
Thank you,
Miss Cretites.

541
00:42:02,422 --> 00:42:08,428
Do sit still, Mr. Latimer.
Do come in, Watson.

542
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:22,709
Who the hell are you?

543
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,845
The third member of the party is absent,

544
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:27,325
but I'm sure he will return.

545
00:42:57,678 --> 00:42:59,279
Miss Cretites, may I ask...

546
00:42:59,379 --> 00:43:01,615
...if you are this man's
prisoner or companion?

547
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,384
Don't say anything.

548
00:43:03,484 --> 00:43:06,186
They have no right to ask
you anything at all.

549
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:08,655
If they were the police,
they would have said so.

550
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,791
Why the police,
Mr. Latimer?

551
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:13,227
Were you expecting to meet them?

552
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:15,596
Look, I don't know who you are,

553
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:18,465
nor do I know how you know my name,

554
00:43:18,565 --> 00:43:20,334
but I'm traveling with my fiancèe...

555
00:43:20,434 --> 00:43:22,803
...to the Continent to get married.

556
00:43:22,903 --> 00:43:24,438
So, would you please leave us alone?

557
00:43:24,538 --> 00:43:26,874
Otherwise, I shall be obliged to call a guard.

558
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,974
Please do.

559
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:32,376
I'm sure Dr. Watson would do it for you.

560
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,283
Ah, I see you know who I am?

561
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,486
Then may I be permitted to ask...

562
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,789
...your fiancèe the question again?

563
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:44,725
It's true what he said.

564
00:43:44,825 --> 00:43:46,660
We are going to be married?

565
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,128
Where?

566
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:49,930
In Athens.

567
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,265
I fear not.

568
00:43:51,365 --> 00:43:52,800
And who is going to stop us?

569
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,401
If not the police,
then I will.

570
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,570
Miss Cretites, do you
seriously want me to believe...

571
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,240
...that you are leaving England willingly?

572
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:01,475
Yes.

573
00:44:01,575 --> 00:44:04,478
To marry the man who has
just murdered your brother?

574
00:44:04,578 --> 00:44:06,080
That's not true.

575
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:08,549
No. Murdered?

576
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,250
It isn't true, is it?

577
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,553
He's going to meet us in
Greece as soon as he's well.

578
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,355
That's what you said to me.

579
00:44:14,455 --> 00:44:16,623
And he will Sophia,
he will.

580
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:18,959
Your brother is dead,
Miss Cretites.

581
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,761
Don't listen to him.

582
00:44:20,861 --> 00:44:24,941
I found his body myself
in the house in Beckinum.

583
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,601
He had been murdered.

584
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:29,236
tortured to death.

585
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,738
No, it can't be.

586
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,141
Harold, tell me what's happened.

587
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:35,976
As for you,
Mr. Latimer,

588
00:44:36,076 --> 00:44:41,014
Mr. Merlas is alive as
a witness to see you hanged.

589
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,470
Help me, Sophia, help me.

590
00:45:03,604 --> 00:45:09,943
Help me. Help me.

591
00:45:44,211 --> 00:45:47,714
...went very well,
very well indeed.

592
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:50,617
I have friends dead.

593
00:45:50,717 --> 00:45:54,388
Yes, but I need not elaborate,

594
00:45:54,521 --> 00:45:57,891
as I see you are a man of the world, sir?

595
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,660
On the contrary...

596
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,563
I've never left England in my life.

597
00:46:02,663 --> 00:46:04,064
Haven't you?

598
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:05,566
No.

599
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:08,736
Then sir, if you must choose one country,

600
00:46:08,836 --> 00:46:11,205
it must be Greece...

601
00:46:11,305 --> 00:46:14,705
...the land of Gods,
olives and intrigue.

602
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:20,114
It is my destination,
Greece.

603
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,549
Do you speak Greek, sir?

604
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:26,987
No, but one can always
find a good interpreter.

605
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:31,790
Thank you.

606
00:46:31,892 --> 00:46:34,361
An excellent meal.

607
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,797
well, good bye, sir.

608
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:39,066
It was a pleasure meeting you.

609
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,434
Well, good bye.

610
00:46:40,534 --> 00:46:43,509
It was an interesting conversation.

611
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:46,640
I do apologize.

612
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:52,913
Sometimes,
I forget my size.

613
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:00,852
Goodbye again.

614
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:17,504
Is it true about Paul?

615
00:47:17,604 --> 00:47:19,604
I'm afraid so.

616
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,747
I hated Harold Latimer.

617
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,684
I hated him,
and I loved him.

618
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:34,321
I would have done anything he said.

619
00:47:34,455 --> 00:47:38,192
I would have gone anywhere with him.

620
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:41,195
Even though he murdered your brother?

621
00:47:41,295 --> 00:47:46,233
Yes, even then.

622
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,773
Mr. Cana,

623
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:54,873
we were expecting you.

624
00:48:00,447 --> 00:48:04,885
I believe this is your revolver, sir?

625
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:35,282
Well, brother of mine...

626
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,384
...we seem to be heading
down the path of crime.

627
00:48:37,484 --> 00:48:39,286
The only path I intend to take...

628
00:48:39,386 --> 00:48:41,488
...is the door to the Diogenes Club,

629
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:44,053
which I will close behind me.

630
00:48:50,164 --> 00:48:51,832
What will become of her?

631
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:54,142
After questioning,
nothing.

632
00:48:54,168 --> 00:48:56,537
There's not a crime to her cold heart,

633
00:48:56,637 --> 00:48:59,782
and not a single shred of compassion.

634
