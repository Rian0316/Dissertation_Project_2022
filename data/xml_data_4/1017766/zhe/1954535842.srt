Does it make you kind of sad that we don't share the same last name?

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,520
在21世纪的今天来看
You know, in a totally evolved 21st-century kind of way,

是有一点儿

你知道我们该做什么
You know what we should do?

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,230
我们应该用一个全新的姓
We should come up with a whole new last name.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,600
这个容易 莉莉和马修・斯凯沃克

00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,810
宣布什么?
Tell people what?

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,100
那不行  到底宣布什么?
Absolutely. Tell people what?

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,920
你见过巴尼吗
- Hi. Have you met Barney? - Hey. Barney Stinson.

你好  巴尼・斯汀森

34
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,050
衣服很漂亮
Lovely dress. I know, I'm sick of these things, too.

35
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,050
我也对这种事情厌烦透了

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
就像同一个婚礼重复一遍又一遍  你完全说对了
It's like the same wedding over and over again. You're totally right.

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,230
要跳舞吗? 好极了  舞池上见
You want to dance? Great, see you out there. Tell people what?

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,990
宣布什么?

39
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,930
我们现在不想谈论这个话题 好吗  巴尼?
Look, this is just not something we want to talk about right now, okay, Barney?

40
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,830
好吧
Okay.

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,370
差点儿包不住了
Whoo, that was a close one.

42
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,170
你想他会就这么算了吗?
Think he'll actually let it go?

43
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,640
宣布什么?宣布什么?宣布什么?
Tell people what? Tell people what? Tell people what?

44
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,840
宣布什么?宣布...
Tell people what? Tell people...

45
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,400
停车场有一辆黑色尼桑没有关车灯
There's a black Nissan Stanza in the parking lot with it's lights on.

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,990

请给我一杯水
Can I get a water please?

54
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,900
- 宣布什么? - 天呐  好吧
- Tell people what? - Oh, God! Okay.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,200
我们是有些...事情要说
Look, we have some... news.

56
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,680
但今天是莉莉和马修的好日子 我们不想让大家把视线从他们身上挪开
But we don't want to draw attention away from Lily and Marshall's big day.

57
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,490
所以别再提这事了 等他们去度蜜月了再说
So just forget about it until they leave for the honeymoon.

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,750
好吧
Fine.

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,030
- 那可是个惊人的消息 -上帝啊  快告诉我
- It's pretty big, though. - Oh, my God, just tell me!

60
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,800
- 帮帮我们 - 怎么了
- Oh, help us. - What's wrong?

61
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,240
我快饿死了
We're starving.

62
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,240
我们让酒店安排了 这么美味的食品
We planned this amazing meal with the caterers,

63
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,940
可我们还一口都没吃上
and we haven't had a bite of it.

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,150
每次刚想吃总会被鸡尾酒代替
Every time we get near the food, we get cocktail weiner blocked.

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,810
马修
Marshall!

66
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,060
我们一整天都没吃东西了
We haven't eaten all day.

67
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,530
我们来想想办法
All right, let's run some interference.

68
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,680
让你们能安稳的坐到餐桌上去
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table. Come on.

69
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,230
你们在这里
Oh, there you are.

70
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,660
亲爱的  你真漂亮
My dear, you look so beautiful.

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,170
谢谢  格兰 我们正打算...
Thanks, Grammie, but we really need to...

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,840
还有你... 看起来就像四十年代的电影明星
And you... you look like a 1940s movie star.

73
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,510
你看起来就象撒上胡椒粉的烤小羊 再配上薄荷果冻
And you look like a pepper-crusted rack of lamb with mint jelly.

74
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,580
让他俩去吃点东西
All right, let's get these two back to their table.

75
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,250
一会你们会一起来跳康迦舞?
We will see you on the floor for the conga line later, won't we?

76
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,390
那个问题早在几周前就有答案了
The answer to that one was decided weeks earlier.

77
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,320
几周前

78
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,320
康迦舞
Conga line.

79
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,530
当然
Oh, yes, definitely.

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,550
放一段展现你们俩 这些年生活片段的幻灯片怎么样
How about a slide show of you guys through the years

81
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,440
就像格林・德的作品《你们的日子》 (摇滚乐队)
set to Green Day's "Time of Your Life"

82
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,450
以你们孩子一张张的照片为结尾
and ending with your baby photos side by side.

83
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,820
棒极了  记到清单上
Oh, that's great. Going on the list.

84
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,750
什么清单
What list?

85
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,100
传统的  土气的东西 在我的婚礼上统统不要
Horrible wedding clichs we're not going to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,180
就像First Corinthians (古典音乐)?
Oh, like First Corinthians?

87
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,590
圣经诗歌?
That Bible verse?

88
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,890
每个婚礼上都会颂读的
They do that at every wedding.

89
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,940
什么内容?
How's it go?

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,530
爱  是忍耐和宽容
"Love is patient and kind.

91
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,410
爱  不能嫉妒和炫耀
"Love does not envy or boast.

92
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,690
也不是傲慢和粗鲁
"It is not arrogant or rude.

93
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,900
爱  不会固执己见
"Love does not insist on it's own way.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,940
不急躁  也不怨恨
"It is not irritable or resentful.

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,730
爱  承担一切
"Love bears all things,

96
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,970
相信一切
"believes all things,

97
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,070
憧憬一切
"hopes all things...

98
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,580
忍耐一切
"endures all things."

99
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,850
- 老土 - 记到清单上
- Lame. - Going on the list.

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,390
我们做到了一个 新奇而有趣的婚礼
We've done it. A wedding with zero clichs.

101
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,720
难道说在大厅里举行婚礼 不是传统做法?
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception hall bathroom kind of a clich?

102
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,340
好吧  就这一项?
Well, okay, one clich?

103
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,430
严格说来  是两项
Well, technically two.

104
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,060
不  他们又把盘子收走了!
No! They cleared our plates again!

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,470
撒了胡椒粉的烤羊肉 你到哪里去了?!
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb, where did you go?!

106
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,190
在我的新婚之夜应该有你相伴的
It's my wedding night. I was supposed to have my way with you.

107
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,510
别伤心了  你还有我
Well, you still have me.

108
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,700
是...
Yeah...

109
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,200
事实上我们正在讨论一些事情
Anyway, guys, we're kind of in the middle of something,

110
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,170
所以你们要么滚一边淌口水去 要么去享受一份无性但紧张的宁静
so if you could go bicker or share a tense, sexless silence

111
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,550
或者做一些已婚人士该做的事 那就最好不过了
or whatever married people do somewhere else, that'd be great.

112
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,410
不  巴尼 这可是我的婚礼
No, Barney, this is my wedding,

113
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,250
我想坐哪儿就坐哪儿
and I will sit wherever I damn well...

114
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,730
那是些小蛋饼吗
Are those mini quiches?

115
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,560
快说  什么秘密
Tell the secret.

116
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,230
好吧...
Okay, uh...

117
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,900
在我们交往一周年纪念日
it was our anniversary,

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,830
我们去了卡尔麦可餐厅
so we went to this restaurant Carmichael's,

119
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,780
就是我们第一次约会的地方
which is where we went on our first date.

120
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,580
在那里我为罗宾偷了蓝色的法国号
Remember, the place where I stole the blue French horn for Robin?

121
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,560
原来是你
Oh, right, that was you.

122
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,500
我就知道是我认识的什么人
I knew that was somebody I knew.

123
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
什么
What?

124
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,650
老兄  你明明在那里
Dude, you were there.

125
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,130
那是我们生命里 一个值得记住的时刻
That was like a big iconic moment in all of our lives.

126
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,610
对你来说可能是 我可有一大堆精彩的故事
Maybe in your life-- I got a lot of stuff going on.

127
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,760
我们正坐着  侍者过来了...
Okay, so we're sitting there and the waiter comes over...

128
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,180
香槟?
Champagne?

129
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,260
我们没点香槟
Um, we didn't order champagne.

130
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,820
餐厅致以特别祝贺
Compliments of the house.

131
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:36,710
Wow.

132
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,190
多谢
Thanks.

133
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,620
干杯
Cheers.

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,920
就在我的香槟杯底
And there, sitting at the bottom of my champagne glass is...

135
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
小蛋饼
Mini quiche.

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,810
你这个大混蛋
You're a mega-douche.

137
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,840
他们把那张桌子搬回厨房了
Oh, that's right, they moved that table back toward the kitchen,

138
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,400
因为他们要在那里做巧克力喷泉 给你们一个惊喜
because that's where they're setting up a surprise chocolate fountain.

139
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,510
我说漏嘴了...
Oh, no, I gave it away.

140
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,550
杯子里有什么?
So what was in the glass?

141
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,430
对了
Right.

142
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,080
侍者拿着两杯酒过来
So the waiter comes up with two glasses of Dom.

143
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,410
他说香槟?我们没点香槟
He says, "Champagne?" "We didn't order any champagne."

144
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,010
餐厅致以特别祝贺
"Compliments of the house." "Wow."

145
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,910
那些你已经说过了!
You said that already!

146
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,320
罗宾往里一看
Right. So Robin looks down,

147
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,290
就在她的杯子里
and there at the bottom of her glass...

148
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,500
有一枚订婚戒指
Is an engagement ring.

149
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,900
想对新郎新娘说点什么?
Anything you want to say to the bride and groom?

150
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,230
千万不要结婚
Don't get married.

151
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,230
我一会再来好了
Why don't I come back.

152
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,540
订婚戒指?
An engagement ring?

153
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,710
不...不...
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

154
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,410
你不能这样对我  不行
Ted, you cannot do this to me. No.

155
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,950
不  不  绝对不行!
No, no, no!

156
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,410
那正是她说的话
That's what she said.

157
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,880
不
No.

158
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,620
不...不...泰德 你不能这样对我
No, no, no, no, no. Ted, you cannot do this to me.

159
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,640
不  万万不要
No. No, no, no.

160
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,940
你在说些什么?
What are you talking about?

161
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,780
这个...这就是我在说的 它怎么会在我的香槟里?
This. This is what I'm talking about. What is this doing in my champagne?

162
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,850
我得离开这里
Oh, God, listen... I just got to get out of here.

163
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,390
那不是我的
That's not mine.

164
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,550
什么
What?

165
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,340
那不是我的戒指
That's not mine.

166
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,950
那是谁的
Then whose is it?

167
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,770
是我的
It's mine.

168
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,650
詹娜...
Janna...

169
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,610
愿意嫁给我吗
will you marry me?

170
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,210
是的
Yes.

171
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:23,012
Wow.

172
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,250
真是一出闹剧 我好像有点...
That was hilarious. I was like... what?

173
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,150
算了
Anyway.

174
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,830
那是怎么了
What the hell was that?

175
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,780
什么怎么了
What the hell was what?

176
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,540
那种反应?
That reaction?

177
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,350
我以为你在向我求婚
I thought you were proposing to me.

178
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,860
就这样?听起来就像 是我要把你往火坑里推
Really? Because it sounded like you thought I was trying to set you on fire.

179
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,130
你知道我对婚姻的态度
Ted, you know how I feel about marriage.

180
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,590
现在更清楚了
Now more than ever.

181
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,700
对不起 你本计划今晚求婚吗
I'm sorry, were you planning on proposing tonight?

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,400
没有
No.

183
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,490
那为什么这么介意
Then why is this an issue?

184
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,150
因为我在想 我们在一起已经一年了
Because even though you don't want to get married,

185
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,270
我们彼此相爱 就算你不想结婚
I'd like to think the fact that we've been together for a year,

186
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,700
也应该是个稍微温和点的反应
and that we love each other might get me a gentler reaction

187
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,940
而不是  不...不...
than, "No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

188
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,810
你不能这样对我
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.

189
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,350
不...不...
"No. No, no, no."

190
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,870
你说得对我反应过度了
Okay, you're right, I just... freaked out.

191
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,430
我也不知道为什么
I don't know why.

192
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,040
对不起
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,830
我们别把它放在心上好吗
Can we please just let it go?

194
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,400
我做不到
No.

195
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,760
斯汀森
Hey, Stinson.

196
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,130
别再说那些巧克力喷泉的谎话
Never lie to a man about a chocolate fountain.

197
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,000
那你们找到什么吃的了吗
So did you guys find anything to eat?

198
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,580
我吃了4个草莓
I had four strawberries.

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,990
是不是在每个草莓还带着一杯香槟酒?
Was there a side of champagne with each of the strawberries?

200
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,400
正是
Yes.

201
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,350
莉莉你可以打嗝 或是回答  是的
Lily, you could have burped or said the word "Yes,"

202
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,940
可你两样一起做 那正是我娶你的原因
but the fact that you did both is exactly why I married you.

203
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,130
看  还有好多草莓
Oh, look, more strawberries!

204
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,350
后来怎样了?
So what happened next?

205
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,640
- 泰德  别这样 - 不  我是认真的
- Ted, don't do this. - No, seriously.

206
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,440
你觉得你今后五年会在哪儿?
Where do you see yourself in five years?

207
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,060
那你呢?
Where do you see yourself?

208
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,390
老实说今后五年...
Honestly, in five years...

209
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,700
我或许已经结婚了
I probably want to be married.

210
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,830
可我很可能去了阿根廷
And I probably want to be in Argentina.

211
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,800
- 阿根廷? - 或者东京或是巴黎
- Argentina? - Or Tokyo, or Paris.

212
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,640
听我说  泰德 我不知道五年后我在哪里
Look, Ted, I don't know where I'm going to be in five years.

213
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,670
我也不想知道 我希望生活充满冒险
And I don't want to know. I want my life to be an adventure.

214
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,620
我们的关系结束了?
We have an expiration date, don't we?

215
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,570
天呐
Oh, my God.

216
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,560
你们分手了
You guys broke up.

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,280
你们竟然分手了简直不敢相信
You guys broke up. I can't believe it.

218
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,570
巴尼...
Barney...

219
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,440
故事还没有结束
story's not over.

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,390
我们能不能不要 在这里谈这个话题?回家再说不好吗?
Can we please not talk about this here. Can we go home?

221
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,230
是的  当然可以
Yeah, of course.

222
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,280
不好意思  我们能不能...
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this. Can we actually...

223
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,820
上帝啊  是你
Oh, my God, it's you.

224
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,330
我...什么?
Wha... what?

225
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,340
就是你这狗杂种 偷了我们的蓝色法国号
You're the son of a bitch who stole our blue French horn.

226
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,020
快跑!
Run!

227
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,520
跑?你的计策就是逃跑?
Run? Your strategy was run?

228
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,930
这是个完美的办法
It was a perfectly good idea.

229
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,570
他们又没有我们的信用卡资料
They didn't have our credit card information.

230
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,860
他们根本不认识我们
They didn't know us from Adam.

231
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,960
我是这么打算的
I stand by it.

232
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,660
是吗
Yeah?

233
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,290
那结果怎样了?
And how did that work out for you?

234
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,210
我不明白为什么他们 要扣下我的信用卡和驾照
I don't see why they had to keep my credit card and driver's license

235
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,740
直到我们把号送回来
till we bring the horn back.

236
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,710
得了吧  这也能怨他们?
Well, come on, Ted, can you blame them?

237
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,820
对不起 我很抱歉拿了法国号
Look, I'm sorry about the French horn.

238
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,540
我希望还能弥补这事
I want to make this right.

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,920
我们现在最好是... 跑!
So what we're going to do right now is, we're going to run!

240
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,950
那么...阿根廷?
So... Argentina.

241
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,560
阿根廷
Argentina.

242
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,950
怎么以前从没听你提过阿根廷?
Why is this the first I've heard of Argentina?

243
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,710
看来美国的学校地理教得太烂了
Mmm, American schools suck at geography.

244
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,440
告诉你我想去阿根廷重要吗
What would be the point in telling you that I want to live in Argentina?

245
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,620
你不想住这里
You don't want to live there.

246
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,940
我也可以在阿根廷生活
I could want to live in Argentina.

247
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,950
不  你不行
No, you couldn't.

248
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,020
你的生活  你的事业都在这里
I mean, you life is here and your career.

249
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,210
我是记者  我的工作 决定了我可能去任何地方
I'm a journalist, my career could take me anywhere,

250
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,040
我也希望这样
and I hope it does.

251
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,370
我也可以去任何地方  做为建筑师
Hey. I could be an architect anywhere, too.

252
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,260
阿根廷也有不少建筑
They have buildings in Argentina.

253
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,720
还有巴黎  甚至东京
And Paris. And even Tokyo.

254
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,740
我不知道你有没有看过哥斯拉 可他也不会去掀翻没撑开的账蓬
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.

255
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,830
什么意思?你在说 你愿意搬到阿根廷去?
So, what? You're saying you want to move to Argentina?

256
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,190
我总为大学期间没能 花一年时间出国看看感到遗憾
Well, I always regretted not taking a year in college to live abroad.

257
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,770
我刚刚完成一个大工程
I just finished a big project at work.

258
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,020
存了些钱
I got some money saved up.

259
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,310
如果我生命中 有段时间想要这么做 那就是现在
If ever there were a time in my life to do something like this, it's right now.

260
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,900
我们搬到阿根廷去
Let's move to Argentina.

261
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,970
别说了
Oh, shut up.

262
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,100
你感到吃惊?我没有开玩笑
You're scared I might not be kidding.

263
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,500
是吗
Aren't you?

264
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,880
没有
Nope.

265
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,520
去吧  特布罗斯基
Your move, Scherbatsky.

266
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,640
好吧
Okay.

267
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,480
就这么办 一起搬到阿根廷去
Let's do it-- let's move to Argentina.

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,250
不  难以置信
No es posible!

269
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,650
没人会去阿根廷
Nobody moves to Argentina.

270
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,800
阿根廷比索五年内贬值三分之二
The Argentinean peso has dropped two-thirds in five years,

271
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,190
政府反对自由贸易的改革
the government is opposed to free market reforms,

272
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,590
铁道部门罢工后 铁路交通也一片混乱
and the railroad has been a mess since the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.

273
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,710
我在扬基体育馆旁边
I hooked up with an Argentinean exchange student

274
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,550
钓到过一名阿根廷交换生
in a Porta-John outside Yankee Stadium.

275
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,380
她特别健谈
Man, she was chatty.

276
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,920
怎么样  怎么样
Right? Right?

277
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,480
你接到了新娘捧花?
You caught the bouquet?

278
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,720
巴尼
Barney.

279
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,020
故事还在继续
The story's not over yet.

280
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,490
- 等等  等等 - 怎么了
- Wait, wait, wait, wait. - What?

281
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,160
我不知道该不该这么做
I don't know if I can do this to you.

282
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:06,950
做什么?
Do what?

283
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,990
你说愿意搬去阿根廷
Well, you say you want to move to Argentina,

284
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,560
可你想要孩子
but you want to have kids.

285
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,820
没错儿  那里没有孩子
Oh, right. 'Cause there are no kids there.

286
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,270
在圣诞老人的地图上 阿根廷是一个大黑X
On Santa's map of the world, there's a big black "X" over Argentina.

287
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,870
- 你懂我的意思 - 不  我懂
- You know what I mean. - No, I don't.

288
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,390
好吧  假定我们有了孩子
Okay, say we had kids.

289
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,930
他们也不一定要在农村长大
They wouldn't have to grow up in some suburb somewhere.

290
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,920
他们也可以 跟我们一起过冒险的生活
They would grow up on the road having adventures with us.

291
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,150
想想看他们能 收集多少"硬石咖啡"的T恤
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts they could collect.

292
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,810
你知道我从来没想过要孩子
Ted, you know that kids were never a part of my plan.

293
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,720
但是如果有一天我想要孩子了
But if I was going to have someone's babies,

294
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,650
那一定是你的
I'd have your babies.

295
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,100
是时候逃跑了
That's when you run.

296
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,850
快说你跑掉了  泰德
Tell me you ran, Ted.

297
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,910
等等  等等 我们可不想现在就要小孩
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to start having babies right this second.

298
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
你有没有...?
Do you have a...?

299
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,260
不  没有
No, I don't.

300
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,000
也许我们不该继续
Well, we probably shouldn't.

301

是啊
Yeah.

302
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,300
- 赌一次? - 赌一次

303
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,490
不
No.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,830
女士们  先生们 都到这里来
All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're all gather around,

305
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,490
下面莉莉和马修要切蛋糕了

快说故事还没完!
Say the story's not over!

310
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,850
上帝  有人怀孕了 这是我碰到的第12件让人烦心的事了
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried I've ever been that someone's pregnant.

311
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,970
别闹了  莉莉
Okay, Lily.

312
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,690
我真的饿了  千万瞄准 好不好?
I'm really hungry, so let's just, uh, aim for my mouth, okay?

313
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,250
还有  蛋糕的污渍很难洗  记得吗
Besides, the smearing the cake thing's a clich? remember?

314
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,860
不  那样才有趣
No, it's going to be so funny.

315
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,180
莉莉
Lily.

316
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,690
莉莉  快把蛋糕扔我嘴里

00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,250
她没事
And she's okay.

320
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,370
- 她很好 - 只是个玩笑
- She's all right. - That was funny.

321
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,190

结婚生子
Getting married, having kids.

326
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,580
完全是个错误  可怕的错误
It's all a mistake. It's a horrible, horrible mistake.

327
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,860
这家伙完全没有建设性
God, this guy's giving me nothing.

328
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,530
在苏格兰玩开心点
All right, have fun in Scotland.

329
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,970
如果见到尼斯湖水怪 就说泰德向他问好
If you see the Loch Ness Monster, tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"

330
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:46,090
尼斯水怪是女性 泰德  别忘了
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.

331
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,660
老兄
Hey, kiddo.

332
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,390
你会被一大堆 家庭琐事缠得脱不开身
You are going to miss out on a lot of awesome stuff.

333
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,420
当我在外面逍遥快活时
You'll be at home with the kid

334
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,310
你还得在家看孩子
while I am out awesome-ing all over the place.

335
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,110
还有你  会变成个肥婆
And you're going to get fat.

336
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,430
故事还没完呢  巴尼
The story's not over, Barney.

337
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,860
是时候把法国号还给那餐馆了
Okay, time to get the horn back to the bistro.

338
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,770
我不知道是不是 能再来一次  我累坏了
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again. That tuckered me out.

339
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,230
我不是指那个
Not a euphemism.

340
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,580
那好吧  等我换件衣服 我们这就去
Right. Okay, let me just go change, and we'll leave.

341
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,640
你要换衣服  我不用吗
Whoa, whoa, you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.

342
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,100
有点团队精神  小姐
Solidarity, sister.

343
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,470
那可不行  我有换洗衣服 你却没有  得了吧
That is crazy. I have a change of clothes and you don't. Suck it up.

344
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,160
如果我们要共同生活 我的生活用品就应试应该在这里
Well, if we'd actually moved in together, all my stuff would be here,

345
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,980
可我们没有所以...
but we didn't, so...

346
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,860
是啊
Yeah.

347
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,840
我们只是说说而已?
We were all talk, weren't we?

348
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,790
我们没法在一起了?
We're not doing this, are we?

349
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,760
我不想在阿根廷生孩子
I don't want to have kids in Argentina.

350
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,650
我更不想
And I don't want to have kids in Argentina.

351
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,300
那我们该何去何从?
So where does that leave us?

352
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,850
也许...
Well...

353
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,620
我们还是可以一起生活...
we could stay together and...

354
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,170
假装这些事情都不会发生
pretend this stuff doesn't matter.

355
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,910
或者...
Or...

356
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,640
我们把法国号还回去
we could give back the blue French horn.

357
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,780
你为我偷来的蓝色法国号
You stole a blue French horn for me.

358
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
我愿意为你偷整个乐队
I would have stolen you a whole orchestra.

359
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,470
你们确实分手了?
You did break up.

360
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,150
不错
Yep.

361
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,560
你也没有怀孕?
You're not pregnant?

362
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,780
没有
Nope.

363
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,510
马修和莉莉还一无所知?
An-And Marshall and Lily don't know?

364
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,690
后来  我们过来想要告诉你们
Well, afterwards, uh, we came by to tell you guys,

365
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,600
可莉莉实在压力很大
but Lily was pretty stressed out, so...

366
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,190
我们决定在婚礼结束前什么也不说
We decided not to say anything till after the wedding.

367
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,640
你们还好吧
You guys okay?

368
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,960
这两周当然不会好过 不过...
Well, it hasn't been the easiest two weeks of our lives, but...

369
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,010
我们还挺得住
But we're okay.

370
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,560
多亏了那酒吧
The open bar helps.

371
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,620
打扰了  女士
- Excuse me, Miss. - Hi.

372
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,570
能请你跳支舞吗
Could I have this dance?

373
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,710
我们都知道这一天终究会来
Well, we knew this day would come eventually.

374
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,510
照顾好她  小绅士
Take care of her, little man.

375
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,450
这是目前为止 你醉得最厉害的一次了
This is by far the drunkest I've ever seen you.

376
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,170
司机
Uh, driver.

377
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,461
Hello!

378
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,750
瑞吉
Ranjit.

379
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,600
回酒店之前能先停一下吗
Hey, can we make a stop before we head back to the hotel?

380
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,850
不用停
You do not have to stop.

381
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:19,670
你们可以就在后座上办事
You can be together as man and wife right back there,

382
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,850
我是好哥们儿
and because we are friends...

383
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,180
我不会偷看的
I will not watch.

384
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,870
不  事实上 我们有别的事要办
Um, no, we actually had something else in mind.

385
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,800
当然
Okay.

386
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,600
莉莉  去坐下
Lily, go sit down.

387
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,720
欢迎来到维勒饼屋
Welcome to Wienerburger.

388
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:39,793
Hi.

389
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,420
我要1号餐  别加泡菜
Can we get a number one, please, with no pickles?

390
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,910
再来一个4号餐  不要洋葱
And a number four with no onions.

391
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,530
让我猜一下 刚参加完杰斐逊高级舞会?
Let me guess. Jefferson High prom?

392
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,860
不
No.

393
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,200
不过谢谢你
But thank you.

394
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,920
其实  我们刚刚结婚了
Actually, we just got married.

395
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,190
- 恭喜了 - 谢谢
- Wow. Congratulations. - Thank you.

396
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,110
7.80美元
That's $7.80.

397
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,410
- 老兄 - 什么
- Hey, dude. - Yeah.

398
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,380
我不知道怎么说才好 你妻子刚刚吐到垃圾箱里了
I don't know how to say this, but your wife just threw up in the trash.

399
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,290
我的妻子
My wife.

400
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,920
马修和莉莉终成眷属
So Marshall and Lily were married,

401
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,030
罗宾和我却分道扬飙
and Robin and I were broken up.

402
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,810
那时候的确很难过
And as hard as it was at the time,

403
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,810
最终我们还是选择了忠于自己
in the end we both got what we wanted.

404
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,780
她如愿去了阿根廷
She did eventually go on to live in Argentina

405
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,430
摩洛哥  希腊还有俄罗斯
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,

406
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,390
甚至在日本小住一段时间
even Japan for a little while.

407
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,040
而我  则遇到了你们的老妈
And I... well, I met your mom.

408
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,760
我深刻地认识到 如果你知道自己想要什么样的生活
I think for the most part if you're really honest with yourself

409
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:39,480
并且诚实面对自己的心意
about what you want out of life,

410
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,200
那么你会得到想要的一切
life gives it to you.

411
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,310
当然  在那一刻 我其实想要一杯威士忌加苏打
Of course, at that moment, all I really wanted was a scotch and soda

412
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,920
再来支雪茄
and a cigar.

413
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,410
你和罗宾的事我真的很遗憾
I'm really sorry about you and Robin.

414
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,260
我平时总到处开玩笑 希望你们俩分手
I know I was always joking around about wanting you two to break up,

415
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,050
可说实话你们是天生一对
but you were really good together.

416
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,820
是的...
Yeah...

417
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,960
的确
we were.

418
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,490
只是她不是 命中注定的那一个  你懂吗?
She just wasn't the one, you know?

419
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,560
注定的  泰德  够了
The one. Oh, Ted, no.

420
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,350
别又跟我说你要重新开始寻找真爱了
Do not tell me you're going to start searching for "the one" again.

421
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,420
只有当我听说你找到注定的那个的时候
The only time I want to hear you saying "the one"

422
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,350
再跟我说什么 "姻缘天定"的鬼话  怎么样
is if it's followed by the word "hundredth." What up?

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,470
不  我要摆脱这一切
No, I need a break from all that, I...

424
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,070
我要离开这里 去找点乐子  明白吗
I just want to get out there and have fun for a while, you know?

425
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,450
是吗
Really?

426
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,360
因为...
'Cause...

427
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,580
你知道吗?你们恋爱已经一年了
you know, you've been in a relationship for a year.

428
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,880
你已经有点迟钝了
You're going to... be a little rusty.

429
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,750
- 没错 - 我是说
- Yeah. - I'm just saying...

430
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,640
你会需要 需要一点点帮助
you're gonna need, need, need some help out there.

431
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,610
可能吧
Could be.

432
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,720
泰德?
Ted?

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,520
干嘛  巴尼
Yes, Barney.

434
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,370
你有没有觉得...
Do you think...

435
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,020
也许你...
Do you think maybe you might...

436
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,400
又需要一个搭档了?
need a wingman again?

437
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,150
是的
I do.

438
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,320
太好了
Yes!

439
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,880
是的  我们又回到从前了
Yes! We're back.

440
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,710
我们回去了
We are back.

441
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,190
泰德  好小子 我们会成为传奇...
And Ted, my boy, it's going to be legend...

442
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,500
Wait for it.
