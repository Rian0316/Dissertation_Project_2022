00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,210
孩子
Hello.

2
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,970
你没事吧
Are you all right?

3
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,230
怎么了  亲爱的  是不是迷路了
What is it, dear? Are you lost?

4
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:33,630

5
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,780
巴斯克维尔的猎犬

6
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,550
- 无聊死了  - 你就这样搭地铁
- Well, that was tedious.  - You went on the tube like that?

7
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,290
出租车都不肯载我
None of the cabs would take me.

8
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,190
有新闻吗
Nothing?

9
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,480
乌干达军事政变
Military coup in Uganda.

10
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,150
又是一张你的照片  戴着那顶...
Another photo of you with the...

11
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,420
内阁重组
Well, um, Cabinet reshuffle?

12
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,850
就没点重要的事吗
Nothing of importance?

13
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,420
真要命
God!

14
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,190
约翰  我得来点  给我弄去
John, I need some. Get me some.

15
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,030
- 不行  - 给我弄点来
- No.  - Get me some.

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,170
不行  我们说好了完全戒烟
No. Cold turkey we agreed, no matter what.

17
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,290
反正你打点了附近所有商店  记得吗
Anyway, you've paid everyone off, remember?

18
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,680
两英里内没人会给你半根烟丝
No- one within a two- mile radius will sell you any.

19
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,380
这么蠢的主意是谁出的
Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?

20
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,250
赫德森太太
Mrs Hudson!

21
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,700
听着  夏洛克  你最近表现很好
Look, Sherlock, you're doing really well,

22
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,470
- 别前功尽弃  - 快告诉我放哪了
- don't give up now!  - Tell me where they are!

23
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,260
拜托  快说
Please, tell me.

24
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,650
求你
Please.

25
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,380
帮不了你  抱歉
Can't help, sorry.

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,030
我告诉你下周彩票中奖号码
I'll let you know next week's lottery numbers.

27
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,330
我就知道  可总得一试
It was worth a try.

28
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,160
我的私藏呢  把我的私房烟弄哪去了
My secret supply, what have you done with my secret supply?

29
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,580
香烟  你把它们藏哪了  藏哪了到底
Cigarettes, what have you done with them?  Where are they?

30
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,660
你根本不让我收拾你的东西  
You never let me touch your things!

31
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,090
幸好你不让
Chance would be a fine thing.

32
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,400
- 记得你不是我们管家  - 的确不是
- I thought you weren't my housekeeper.  - I'm not.

33
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,270
来杯茶怎么样
How about a nice cuppa

34
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,890
也许你可以先把鱼叉放一边
and perhaps you could put away your harpoon?

35
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,240
茶不够劲儿
I need something stronger than tea.

36
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,710
得比茶高七成的威力才行
Seven percent stronger.

37
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,260
你又去找查特吉先生了吗
You've been to see Mr Chatterjee again.

38
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,100
什么
Pardon?

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,520
三明治店那个  你穿着新裙子
Sandwich shop. That's a new dress,

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,070
袖子上沾了面粉
but there's flour on the sleeve.

41
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,480
你不会穿成这样做点心
You wouldn't dress like that for baking.

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,230
- 夏洛克  - 指甲里有金属屑
- Sherlock...  - Thumbnail. Tiny traces of foil.

43
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,430
你又玩刮刮乐
Been at the scratch cards again.

44
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,440
我们都清楚你玩那东西没好结果
We all know where that leads, don't we?

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,640
皇城之夜  
Kasbah Nights.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,600
周一早上就擦这个有点太过了吧  你觉得呢
Pretty racy for a Monday morning, wouldn't you agree?

47
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,640
我写了篇关于香水鉴定的博客
I wrote a blog on the identification of perfumes.

48
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,230
就在我的网站上
It's on the website.

49
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,190
你该去看看
You should look it up!

50
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,500
- 够了吧  - 别指望那个查特吉
- Please!  - Don't pin your hopes on

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660
会带你一起坐船出海了
that cruise with Mr Chatterjee,

52
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,830
他在唐卡斯特有老婆  
he's got a wife in Doncaster

53
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,180
- 只是别人不知道   - 夏洛克
- that nobody knows about.  - Sherlock!

54
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,480
当然除了我
Well, nobody except me.

55
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,230
我不知道你在说什么  我真不知道
I don't know what you're talking about, I really don't!

56
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,490
你到底在搞什么飞机 
What the bloody hell was all that about?

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,560
你不懂
You don't understand.

58
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,170
追上去  向她道歉
Go after her and apologise.

59
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,600
道歉
Apologise?

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,360
约翰  我真嫉妒你
John, I envy you so much.

61
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,260
你嫉妒我个什么
You envy me?

62
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,460
你的头脑  简单平和  基本不转
Your mind, it's so placid, straight- forward, barely used.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,880
而我的就像个引擎  不受控制地转个没完
Mine's like an engine, racing out of control.

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,450
就像枚火箭  被卡在了发射台上
A rocket, tearing itself to pieces,

65
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,240
快被自己炸成碎片了  
trapped on the launch pad.

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,250
我要新案子
I need a case!

67
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,480
你才刚解决了一个
You've just solved one,

68
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,510
而且还是用鱼叉叉头死猪
by harpooning a dead pig, apparently!

69
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,760
那都是早上的事了
That was this morning.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,160
- 下一个呢  - 网站上没消息
- When's the next one?  - Nothing on the website?

71
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,260
亲爱的夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生  
"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes.

72
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,160
我的铃兰不见了
I can't find Bluebell anywhere.

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,020
求你了  能帮帮我吗
Please, please, please can you help?"

74
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,870
铃兰是啥鬼
Bluebell?

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,640
是只兔子  约翰  还有下文
A rabbit, John! But there's more.

76
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,690
铃兰失踪前  它开始发光
Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous.

77
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,750
好像小精灵  这是小柯丝蒂的描述
"Like a fairy," According to little Kirsty.

78
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,960
第二天早上  铃兰就失踪了
Then the next morning, Bluebell was gone.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,610
笼子锁着  没有强行闯入的痕迹
Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry.

80
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,570
我说啥来着  真是精彩
What am I saying, this is brilliant!

81
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,740
打给雷斯垂德
Phone Lestrade.

82
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,320
告诉他有只兔子跑了
Tell him there's an escaped rabbit.

83
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,250
你开玩笑  
Are you serious?

84
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,500
不玩这个就玩妙探寻凶[推理卡牌]
It's this or Cluedo.

85
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,660
才不要  再也不跟你玩那个了
No. We are never playing that again.

86
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,320
- 为啥  - 因为凶手
- Why not?  - Because it's not actually possible

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
不能是被害人  夏洛克
for the victim to have done it, Sherlock. That's why.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,150
这是唯一可能的解法
It was the only possible solution.

89
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,010
但这不符合游戏规则
It's not in the rules.

90
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,060
那就是游戏规则错了
Well, then, the rules are wrong!

91
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,900
一声铃
A single ring.

92
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,950
力度极大  还不到半秒
Maximum pressure, just under the half second.

93
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,790
是委托人
Client!

94
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,100
达特摩尔是个充满神话和传奇色彩的地方
Dartmoor, it's always been a place of myth and legend,

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,670
但在茫茫荒野中是否还隐藏着其他什么
but is there something else lurking out here?

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,480
某种真实存在的生物
Something very real.

97
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,470
达特摩尔一直以来也是
Dartmoor is also home to one

98
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:40,570
政府顶级机密行动的基地
the government's most secret of operations,

99
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,150
这里的生化武器研究中心
the chemical and biological weapons research centre,

100
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,930
敏感度据说甚至超过波顿镇实验室
which is said to be even more sensitive than Porton Down.

101
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,500
自二战结束后
Since the end of the Second World War,

102
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,680
关于巴斯克维尔实验的传闻
there have been persistent stories

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,620
从未断绝过
about the Baskerville experiments.

104
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,870
利用基因变异培养用于战场的生物
Genetic mutations, animals grown for the battlefield.

105
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,210
很多人相信在这些栅栏后
There are many who believe that within this compound,

106
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,600
在这片古老荒野的腹地中
in the heart of this ancient wildness,

107
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,820
有着超乎想象的恐怖存在
there are horrors beyond imagining.

108
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,720
但真正的问题是  
But the real question is,

109
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,440
他们还被控制在基地内部吗
are all of them still inside?'

110
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,490
那时我还是个孩子
I was just a kid.

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,650
亨利・奈特
格林盆居民

112
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,440
就在那片荒原上
It was on the moor.

113
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,450
亨利的绘画（9岁）

114
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,320
天很黑  可我确定我看见了
It was dark, but I know what I saw.

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,270
我知道是什么东西杀死了我父亲
I know what killed my father.

116
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,900
你看见了什么
What did you see?

117
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,350
下面正要说到了
I was just about to say.

118
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
对  可那是电视采访  
Yes, in a TV interview.

119
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,260
我更想听听原版
I prefer to do my own editing.

120
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,960
对  抱歉  当然了
Yes. Sorry, yes, of course.

121
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,310
不好意思
Excuse me.

122
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,600
不着急
In your own time.

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,610
还是快点
But quite quickly.

124
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,950
- 你知道达特摩尔吗  福尔摩斯先生  - 不
- Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes?  - No.

125
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,310
那是个神奇的地方  与众不同
It's an amazing place, it's like nowhere else,

126
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,340
虽然荒凉  却很美
it's sort of bleak, but beautiful.

127
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,080
没兴趣  继续说
Not interested. Moving on.

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,070
妈妈过世后  我和爸爸常出去散步
We used to go for walks, after my mum died, my dad and me.

129
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,010
每天晚上  我们都会去那片荒原
Every evening, we'd go out onto the moor.

130
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,800
很好  直接跳到你父亲被杀那晚
Yes, good. Skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed,

131
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,990
事发地在哪
where did that happen?

132
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,830
那里有个地方
There's a place,

133
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,020
可以说是个地标  叫恶魔谷
it's a sort of local landmark, called Dewer's Hollow.

134
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,490
那是魔鬼的古称
That's an ancient name for the devil.

135
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,590
然后呢
So?

136
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,300
那晚你们看见魔鬼了吗
Did you see the devil that night?

137
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,190
看见了
Yes.

138
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,810
它体型巨大
It was huge.

139
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:40,680
煤黑色皮毛  红色眼睛
Coal- black fur with red eyes.

140
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,520
它抓住了他
It got him.

141
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,830
撕扯他  把他撕成了碎片
Tore at him, tore him apart.

142
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,580
其它的我记不起来了
I can't remember anything else.

143
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,970
第二天早上被找到时  
They found me the next morning,

144
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,590
我就在荒原上游荡
just wandering on the moor.

145
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,130
我父亲的尸体至今没有找到
My dad's body was never found.

146
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,780
红色眼睛  煤黑皮毛  体型巨大
Red eyes, coal- black fur, enormous...

147
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,760
狗  还是狼
A dog? Wolf?

148
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,710
也许是基因实验产品
Or a genetic experiment.

149
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,670
你是在笑我吗  福尔摩斯先生
Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes?

150
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,220
怎么  你在开玩笑吗
Why, are you joking?

151
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,420
我父亲一直在怀疑
My dad was always going on about the things

152
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,250
巴斯克维尔的秘密
they were doing at Baskerville.

153
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,630
他们究竟造出了什么样的怪兽
About the type of monsters they were breeding there.

154
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,260
过去别人总是嘲笑他
People used to laugh at him.

155
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,210
至少电视台的人把我说的当回事
At least the TV people took me seriously.

156
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,410
我猜这节目带动了德文郡的旅游业  
And I assume did wonders for Devon tourism.

157
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,220
好了...
Yeah...

158
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
亨利  无论你父亲发生了什么事  
Henry, whatever did happen to your father,

159
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,610
那已经是20年前了
it was 20 years ago.

160
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,270
为什么现在才来找我们
Why come to us now?

161
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,960
我不确定你是不是能帮我
Not sure you can help me,

162
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,350
福尔摩斯先生  你竟然以为这是笑话
Mr Holmes, since you find it all so funny!

163
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,780
因为昨晚发生的事
Because of what happened last night.

164
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,350
什么  昨晚发生了什么事
Why, what happened last night?

165
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,770
你怎么知道
How... How do you know?

166
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,310
我并不知道  我观察到的
I didn't know, I noticed.

167
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,120
你坐德文郡开出的第一班火车过来
You came up from Devon on the first available train this morning.

168
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
吃了差劲的早餐  喝了清咖啡
You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee.

169
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,150
过道对面的女孩吸引了你
The girl on the seat across the aisle fancied you.

170
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,170
虽然你最初很热情  不过很快又冷淡了
Though initially keen, you've now changed your mind.

171
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,700
而你现在  正急不可待地
You are, however, extremely anxious

172
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,960
想要抽今天的第一支烟
to have your first cigarette of the day.

173
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,040
奈特先生  请坐下抽完这支烟  
Sit down, Mr Knight, and do please smoke.

174
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,700
我很乐意你这么做
I'd be delighted.

175
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,300
你到底怎么会注意到这些
How on Earth did you notice all that?

176
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,240
这不重要...
It's not important...

177
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,640
穿孔纸屑证明你被检过票  
Punched out holes where your ticket's been checked.

178
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,390
现在不是时候  夏洛克
Not now, Sherlock.

179
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,940
- 我都快憋死了  - 你这是炫耀
- Oh, please, I've been cooped- up for ages!  - You're showing off.

180
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,830
我就是爱炫耀
Of course I am a show- off,

181
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,440
我们这类人就这样
that's what we do.

182
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,490
你用火车上的餐巾擦过溅出的咖啡
Train napkin you used to mop up the spilled coffee.

183
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,490
那污渍表明你没有加牛奶
Strength of the stain shows that you didn't take milk.

184
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,500
上面还有番茄酱渍  
There are traces of ketchup on it

185
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,070
在你的嘴角和袖口也有
and on your lips and your sleeve.

186
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,250
英式早点  差不多就是
Cooked breakfast, or the nearest thing

187
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,410
火车上能提供的那些  大概是三明治
those trains can manage. Probably a sandwich.

188
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,810
你怎么知道早餐很差劲
How did you know it was disappointing?

189
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,490
火车上还能有什么  
Is there any other type of breakfast on a train?

190
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,950
那女孩
The girl.

191
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,580
女性笔迹很有特点  
Female handwriting's distinctive,

192
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,890
纸巾上是她的电话
wrote her phone number down on the napkin.

193
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:57,760
从书写的角度来看
I can tell from the angle

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,230
她写字时面对你
she wrote at that she was sat across from you

195
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,950
还隔着条走道
on the other side of the aisle.

196
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,450
我猜在她下车后不久
Later after she got off, I imagine

197
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,260
你用纸巾擦了洒出来的咖啡
you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee,

198
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,610
不小心把号码弄糊了
accidentally smudging the numbers.

199
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,760
你用另一支笔重描了后四位
You've been over the last four digits in another pen,

200
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,680
所以你打算留着号码
so you wanted to keep the number.

201
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,560
可刚才你又用它擦鼻子
Just now you used the napkin to blow your nose,

202
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,530
所以你对她已经没什么兴趣了
so maybe you're not that into her after all.

203
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:14,060
你颤抖的手指上有
Then there's the nicotine stains on your fingers,

204
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,580
尼古丁熏染的痕迹
your shaking fingers.

205
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,950
我熟悉这种痕迹
I know the signs.

206
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,510
你在火车上没机会抽烟
No chance to smoke when on the train,

207
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,750
打车来这里前也没时间
no time to roll one before you got a cab here.

208
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,240
现在才刚过9点15  你很绝望
It's just after 9.15, you're desperate.

209
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,020
从埃克塞特到伦敦的第一班车5点46发
The first train from Exeter to London leaves at 5.46am.

210
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,790
你坐了第一班车  说明昨晚
You got the first one, so something important

211
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,360
一定发生了很重要的事  没错吧
must have happened last night. Am I wrong?

212
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:33,880
没错
No.

213
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,170
你说得对
You're right.

214
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,730
一点不差  相当准确
You're completely, exactly right.

215
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,180
见鬼  我早听说过你思维敏捷
Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.

216
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,880
这是我的工作  现在别说了先来一支
It's my job. Now shut up and smoke.

217
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,620
亨利  你父母都去世了
Henry, your parents both died

218
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,710
当时你是七岁左右
and you were what, seven years old?

219
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,650
我想那...
I know, that...

220
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,470
那一定是巨大的创伤
That must be quite a trauma.

221
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,900
你有没有考虑过
Now, have you ever thought

222
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,270
也许是你幻想了这个故事...
that maybe you invented this story, this...

223
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,480
来掩饰这种创伤
to account for it?

224
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,310
莫蒂默医生也这么说
That's what Dr Mortimer says.

225
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:18,720
谁  
Who?

226
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,390
- 他的心理医生  - 我的心理医生
- His therapist.  - My therapist.

227
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,400
显然如此
Obviously.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,410
露易丝・莫蒂默
Louise Mortimer.

229
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,440
她让我回到达特摩尔
She's the reason I came back to Dartmoor.

230
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,940
她觉得我必须面对心魔
She thinks I have to face my demons.

231
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,290
你昨晚回到恶魔谷后
What happened when you went back

232
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,060
发生了什么  亨利
to Dewer's Hollow last night, Henry?

233
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,560
你听了心理医生的话回到那里
You went there on the advice of your therapist

234
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,850
可你现在却来求助咨询侦探
and now you're consulting a detective.

235
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,930
你看到了什么让你改了主意
What did you see that changed everything?

236
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,470
那处山谷很诡异
It's a strange place, the Hollow.

237
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,880
让人内心冰冷  异常恐惧
It makes you feel so cold inside, so afraid.

238
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,390
如果我想读诗  
Yes, if I wanted poetry,

239
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,740
我可以读约翰给女友的电邮
I'd read John's emails to his girlfriends,

240
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,980
比这有趣得多  直说你看到什么
much funnier. What did you see?

241
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,550
脚印
Footprints.

242
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,370
就在我看见我父亲被撕碎的地方
On the exact spot where I saw my father torn apart.

243
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,890
男人的还是女人的
Man's or a woman's?

244
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:03,540
- 都不是  那是...  - 如此而已
- Neither. They were...  - Is that it?

245
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,700
没别的了  脚印  就这些吗
Nothing else? Footprints, is that all?

246
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,090
是的  可那些脚印...
Yes. But they were...

247
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,210
抱歉  莫蒂默医生说对了
No, sorry, Dr Mortimer wins.

248
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,670
用自编的记忆掩盖儿时的心理创伤
It's a childhood trauma masked by an invented memory.

249
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,170
无聊  请吧  奈特先生
Boring. Goodbye, Mr Knight,

250
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,020
谢谢你的烟
thank you for smoking.

251
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,610
可那些脚印呢
What about the footprints?

252
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,860
也许是兽爪印
They're probably paw prints,

253
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,770
什么都可能  也就是什么都没有
could be anything, therefore nothing.

254
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,380
我精神支持你  回去吃点奶油茶点吧
Off to Devon with you and have a cream tea on me.

255
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,230
福尔摩斯先生  
Mr Holmes,

256
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,790
那是一头巨型猎犬的脚印
they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.

257
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,360
再说一遍
Say that again.

258
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,520
我看到一些脚印  非常大...
I found footprints, they were big...

259
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,310
不  要你刚才的原话
No, no, no, your exact words.

260
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,310
原样重复你刚才那句话
Repeat your exact words from a moment ago,

261
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,060
要一字不差
exactly as you said them.

262
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,420
福尔摩斯先生
Mr Holmes,

263
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:50,040
那是一头巨型猎犬的脚印
they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.

264
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,830
- 这案子我接了  - 啥
- I'll take the case. - Sorry, what?

265
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,450
多谢你提醒了我
Thank you for bringing this to my attentions,

266
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,400
- 这里大有文章  - 等会  怎么回事
- it's very promising. - No no no, sorry, what?

267
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:03,200
刚还说脚印无聊呢  现在又说大有文章
A minute ago, footprints were boring, now they're very promising?

268
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,600
跟脚印无关
It's got nothing to do with footprints,

269
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,870
你就没仔细听  巴斯克维尔  听说过吗
you weren't listening. Baskerville, ever heard of it?

270
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,740
大概吧  相当机密的地方
Vaguely. It's very hush- hush.

271
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,590
- 从那查起准没错  - 你要去吗
- Sounds like a good place to start. - You'll come down then?

272
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,100
不  现在我不能离开伦敦  太忙了
No, I can't leave London at the moment, far too busy.

273
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,940
别担心  我最得力的助手会跑一趟
But don't worry, I'm putting my best man onto it.

274
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,480
靠约翰把相关数据传给我肯定没问题
I can always rely on John to send me the relevant data,

275
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,330
虽然他自己一点都不明白
as he never understands a word of it himself.

276
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,790
什么叫你很忙  你手头根本没案子
What are you talking about you are busy? You don't have a case!

277
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,790
- 你刚还在抱怨...  - 约翰  我有铃兰的案子
- A minute ago you were complaining... - Bluebell, John! I've got Bluebell!

278
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,430
那个无故消失的夜光兔子
The case of the vanishing glow- in- the- dark rabbit.

279
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:31,110
- 北约都乱成一团了  - 所以你不去了
- NATO's in uproar. - Sorry, you're not coming, then?

280
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,850
好吧
Ok.

281
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,960
你赢了
Ok.

282
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,370
用不着了  我要去达特摩尔高原
I don't need those any more, I'm going to Dartmoor.

283
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,790
你先去吧  亨利  我们随后就到
You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow later.

284
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,520
所以你要去
Sorry, so you are coming?

285
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,520
20年前的迷案  巨型猎犬
20- year- old disappearance, a monstrous hound?

286
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,660
绝对不能错过
I wouldn't miss this for the world!

287
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,080
说什么一起游船  你根本不想带我上船
..cruise together, you had no intention of taking me on a boat!

288
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,950
看来赫德森太太终于找到
Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to

289
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,670
那个在唐卡斯特的老婆了
the wife in Doncaster.

290
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,380
等她发现伊斯兰堡的那个再说吧
Wait until she finds out about the one in Islamabad.

291
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,810
麻烦去帕丁顿车站
Paddington Station, please.

292
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,430
那边是巴斯克维尔
There's Baskerville.

293
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,030
那是格林盆镇
That's Grimpen Village.

294
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,960
那边肯定是...
So that must be...

295
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,460
对  恶魔谷
Yes, Dewer's Hollow.

296
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,620
那是什么
What's that?

297
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,200
雷区吧
A mine field?

298
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,620
严格说巴斯克维尔是个军事基地
Technically, Baskerville's an army base,

299
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,010
我猜他们一直都不准外人入内
so I guess they've always been keen to keep people out.

300
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,670
看来是
Clearly.

301
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,390
对  一天三次  告诉你们朋友  告诉大家
Right, three tours a day. Tell your friends, tell anyone.

302
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,780
非常欢迎各位  记住
Don't be strangers. And remember,

303
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,390
提防猎犬

304
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,260
晚上千万别去旷野上
stay away from the moor at night,

305
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,800
如果你不想死的话  保重
if you value your lives! Take care.

306
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,170
我冷
It's cold.

307
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,070
十字键旅店
精品套房  提供素食

308
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,670
那部分记忆没变
That part doesn't change.

309
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,710
什么变了
What does?

310
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:59,870
还有别的  是一个词
There's something else. It's a word.

311
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,130
自由
Liberty.

312
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,420
自由
Liberty?

313
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,150
还有个词
And there's another word.

314
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,130
在
In.

315
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,510
IN
I. N.

316
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,030
自由在  这什么意思
Liberty In. What do you think it means?

317
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,520
抱歉不能给你们双人房
Sorry we couldn't do a double room for you boys.

318
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,550
没事  我们不是...
That's fine. We're not...

319
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,330
给
There you go.

320
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,270
- 谢啦  我找你钱  - 谢
- Ta. I'll just get your change. - Ta.

321
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,200
肉类供应

322
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,180
给
There you go.

323
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,490
我注意到
I couldn't help noticing,

324
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,270
那片旷野的地图上  摆着骷髅头
on the map of the moor, a skull and crossbones?

325
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,400
那个啊
That.

326
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,650
- 海盗吗  - 不  叫格林盆大雷区
- Pirates? - No. The Great Grimpen Minefield, they call it.

327
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,540
这样
Right.

328
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,650
不是你想的那样  那是巴斯克维尔试验场
It's not what you think. It's the Baskerville testing site.

329
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,240
有80多年了
It's been going for 80- odd years.

330
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,650
我估计没人知道里面到底有什么
I'm not sure anyone really knows what's there any more.

331
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,800
- 炸弹吗  - 不止是炸弹
- Explosives? - Not just explosives.

332
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,480
他们说闯进那地方
Break into that place and if you're lucky,

333
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,390
被炸死算走运的了
you just get blown up, so they say.

334
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,250
- 免得你散步散到那边  - 谢啦  我会记得
- In case you're planning a wee stroll. - Ta. I'll remember.

335
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,280
嗯  对旅游业有所影响
Aye. No, that buggers up tourism a bit,

336
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,650
多谢那条恶魔猎犬
so thank God for the demon hound.

337
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,140
- 你看那节目了吗  那纪录片  - 前不久看过
- Did you see that show? The documentary? - Quite recently, yeah.

338
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,900
上帝保佑亨利・奈特和那怪物
God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell.

339
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,920
- 见过吗  那猎犬  - 我吗  没有
- Ever seen it? The hound? - Me? No, no.

340
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,580
弗莱彻见过
Fletcher has.

341
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,550
他会带游人参观
He runs the walks,

342
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,250
参观怪物出没的地方  他见过
the monster walks for the tourists, you know. He's seen it.

343
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,110
这生意不错
That's handy for trade.

344
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,810
比利  我们真是要忙死了
I'm just saying we've been rushed off our feet, Billy.

345
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,060
对  很多怪物猎人
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.

346
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,340
费不了多大事
It don't take much these days,

347
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,020
在推特上一发人就都来了
one mention on Twitter and whoomph!

348
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,400
我们没酒了
We're out of WKD.

349
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,430
- 好  - 又是怪物又是监狱的
- Right. - What with the monster and the ruddy prison,

350
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,030
这我们怎么睡得着
I don't know how we sleep nights.

351
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,090
你呢  盖瑞
Do you, Gary?

352
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,770
- 睡得可死了  - 说瞎话  他打呼噜
- Like a baby.- That's not true. He's a snorer. Hey, ssh.

353
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,380
- 你家那位打呼噜不  - 有薯片不
- Is yours a snorer? - Got any crisps?

354
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,200
行  保重  再见
Yeah. No. All right? Right, take care. Bye.

355
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,150
比赛

356
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,790
介意我坐这么
Mind if I join you?

357
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:30,080
假的吧  你根本没见过什么猎犬吧
It's not true, is it, you haven't actually seen this hound thing?

358
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,030
- 你是记者么  - 不  绝对不是  就是好奇
- Are you from the papers? - No, nothing like that, just curious.

359
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,200
- 你见过吗  - 大概吧
- Have you seen it? - Maybe.

360
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,740
有证据吗
Got any proof?

361
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,180
我干嘛告诉你  失陪了
Why would I tell you if I did? Excuse me.

362
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,190
- 我给亨利打了电话  - 打赌结束  约翰  抱歉
- I called Henry. - Bet's off John, sorry

363
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:47,620
- 啥  - 打赌
- What? - Bet?

364
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,460
我的计划得等到天黑才行
My plan needs darkness.

365
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,380
- 还有一个半小时呢  - 等等  什么赌啊
- We've got another half an hour of light. - Wait, wait, what bet?

366
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,110
我跟约翰赌了50英镑
I bet John here 50 quid

367
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,570
说你没法证明你见过猎犬
that you couldn't prove you'd seen the hound.

368
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,910
嗯  酒吧里的人说你可以
Yeah, the guys in the pub said you could.

369
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,150
- 那你就等着输钱吧  老兄  - 是嘛
- Well, you're going to lose your money, mate. - Yeah?

370
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,600
对  我见过
Yeah. I seen it.

371
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,330
就在一个月前  在山谷里
Only about a month ago. Up at the Hollow.

372
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,200
当时有雾  看不太清
It was foggy, mind, couldn't make much out.

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,370
- 明白了  没目击者是吧  - 对  但是...
- I see. No witnesses, I suppose. - No, but...

374
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:11,920
根本没猎犬
Never are.

375
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,020
等等  看那
No, wait. There.

376
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,070
就这样  这叫什么证据
Is that it? It's not exactly proof, is it?

377
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:20,800
抱歉  约翰  我赢了
Sorry, John, I win.

378
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,190
等等  不仅如此
Wait, wait, that's not all.

379
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,950
人们不喜欢去那里
People don't like going up there, you know.

380
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,730
恶魔谷
To the Hollow.

381
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,860
让他们感觉很不好
Gives them a bad sort of feeling.

382
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,890
是闹鬼了么  这样就想说服我啊
Is it haunted? Is that supposed to convince me?

383
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,030
别傻了  才不是那样
Nah, don't be stupid! Nothing like that.

384
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,300
我估计那确实有什么东西
But I reckon there is something out there.

385
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,140
从巴斯克维尔逃出来的东西
Something from Baskerville, escaped.

386
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,120
- 克隆生物  超级狗  - 也许
- A clone? A super- dog? - Maybe.

387
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,170
谁知道这些年他们排放的气体是啥
God knows what they've been spraying on us all these years,

388
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,390
或者水里放了啥
or putting in the water.

389
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,290
我死活都不会信他们
I wouldn't trust them as far as I could spit.

390
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,510
最多就这样么
Is that the best you've got?

391
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,410
我有个曾在国防部工作的朋友
I had a mate once who worked for the MOD.

392
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,250
某个周末我们约好去钓鱼
One weekend we were meant to go fishing,

393
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,970
他没出现  很晚才过来
but he never showed up. Well, not till late.

394
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,170
他来的时候脸色惨白
When he did, he was white as a sheet.

395
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,820
我到现在都记忆犹新
I can see him now.

396
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,510
"我今天看见些东西  弗莱彻"  他说
"I've seen things today, Fletcher," He said,

397
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,350
"我再也不想见第二次"
"and I never want to see again."

398
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,750
"可怕的东西"
"Terrible things."

399
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,970
他被派去过某个秘密军事基地
He'd been sent to some secret army place.

400
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,370
可能是波顿镇
Porton Down, maybe.

401
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,400
也许是巴斯克维尔  或者其他地方
Maybe Baskerville, or somewhere else.

402
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,630
在那边的秘密实验室里
In the labs there, the really secret labs,

403
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,880
他说他见过可怕的东西
he said he'd seen terrible things.

404
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,310
说老鼠和狗一样大
Rats as big as dogs, he said.

405
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,670
狗呢  和马一样大
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.

406
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,100
50块拿来吧
We did say 50.

407
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,750
谢啦
Ta.

408
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,650
危险

409
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,250
禁止入内

410
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,020
巴斯克维尔

411
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,040
禁止入内

412
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,410

谢谢
Thank you.

414
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,640
你还有巴斯克维尔的证件
You've got ID for Baskerville?!

415
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,300
怎么弄的
How?

416
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,600
不是这里的  是我哥哥的证件
It's not specific to this place. It's my brother's.

417
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,720
哪儿都能进  那啥
Access all areas. I, um,

418
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
我好久前拿到的  以防万一
acquired it a quiet ages ago. Just in case.

419
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,830
- 这下好了  - 怎么了
- Brilliant. - What's the matter?

420
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,210
- 我们会被逮捕  - 才不会
- We'll get caught. - No, we won't!

421
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,990
- 目前不会  - 五分钟内就会被捕
- Well, not yet. - Caught in five minutes.

422
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,900
"你好  我们就来看看"
"Hi, officially, we come and have a wander

423
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,460
"你们顶级秘密武器基地"
around your top secret weapons base."

424
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,290
"真的  太好了进来吧  水正好开了"
"Really? Great. Come in, kettle's boiled."

425
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,410
会不会被打死还难说呢
That's if we don't get shot.

426
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,260
- 好了  非常感谢  - 谢谢
- Clear. Thanks very much. - Thank you.

427
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,490
一直向前  长官
Straight through, sir.

428
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,610
顶着麦考夫的名字去哪都行
Mycroft's name literally opens doors.

429
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,530
我早说过  他基本就代表了英国政府
I've told you, he practically is the British Government.

430
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,890
我估计在他们发现不对劲之前
I reckon we've got about 20 minutes

431
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,370
我们有20分钟
before they realise something's wrong.

432
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,830
怎么了  有什么问题吗
What is it? Are we in trouble?

433
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,190
请叫我长官
Are we in trouble, sir.

434
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,350
是  长官  对不起  长官
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

435
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,500
你在等我们么
You were expecting us?

436
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,180
看到您的证件信息就立刻过来了  福尔摩斯先生
Your ID showed up straight away, Mr Holmes.

437
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,570
我是莱昂下士  保安人员
Corporal Lyons, security.

438
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,400
有什么问题吗  长官
Is there something wrong, sir?

439
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,750
下士  我希望没有
I hope not, Corporal, I hope not.

440
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,720
这里通常没有人来检查  长官
We don't get inspected here. You see, sir?

441
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,810
太反常了
It just does't happen.

442
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,050
听说过抽查么
Ever heard of a spot check?

443
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,100
约翰・华生上尉
Captain John Watson,

444
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,800
- 诺森伯兰第五燧发枪手团   - 长官好
- Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. - Sir.

445
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
巴里莫尔少校会不高兴  长官
Major Barrymore won't be pleased, sir.

他一定想见您二位

只怕我们没时间见他  我们要参观一圈

很多  长官
Lots, sir.

有逃走的吗
Any ever escape?

470
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,270
要逃走得学会用电梯  长官
They'd have to know how to use that lift, sir.

471
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,650
我们不会把它们养得那么聪明
We're not breeding them that clever.

没事  弗兰克兰博士
It's all right, Dr Frankland,

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,360
我带两位先生参观一下
I'm just showing these gentlemen around.

476
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,410
新面孔  真好
New faces, how nice.

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,860
不过小心别困在这
Careful you don't get stuck here,though,

478
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,310
我只是过来修龙头
I only came to fix a tap.

那电梯能下几层
How far down does that lift go?

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,470
很多层  长官
Quite a way, sir.

481
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,710
下面是什么
And what's down there?

482
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,620
总得有地方放垃圾  长官
Well, we have to keep the bins somewhere, sir.

483
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,040
两位这边请
This way please, gentlemen.

00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,210
你们在这里都做些什么
So what exactly is it that you do here?

485
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,720
我以为您知道  长官  这不是检查么
I thought you'd know, sir, this being an inspection.

486
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,380
可我不是专家吧
Well, I'm not an expert, am I?

487
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,310

斯坦佩顿博士  请给予我们应得的尊重
We are to be accorded every courtesy, Dr Stapleton.

506
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,480
你在巴斯克维尔是做什么的
What's your role at Baskerville?

507
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,580
刚也说了要以礼相待吧
Accorded every courtesy, isn't that the idea?

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,760
我不能说  政府机密
I'm not free to say. Official secrets.

509

你绝对能说  我强烈建议你这么做
You most certainly are free, and I suggest you remain that way.

510
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,140
我负责多个项目
I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

我喜欢搞混合
I like to mix things up.

513
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,170
大多数时候是混合基因  有时也会摆弄真手指
Genes, mostly. Now and again, actual fingers.

514
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,380
斯坦佩顿  我就知道我听过你的名字
Stapleton! I knew I knew your name.

00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,330
我想没有吧
I doubt it.

人们说这世上绝无巧合
People say there's no such thing as coincidence.

他们的生活一定很无聊

你跟我女儿聊过吗
Have you been talking to my daughter?

520
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:23,120
为什么要弄死铃兰  斯坦佩顿博士
Why did Bluebell have to die, Dr Stapleton?

521
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,240
- 那只兔子  - 失踪了  而笼子锁着
- The rabbit? - Disappeared from inside a locked hutch,

522
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,870
- 很耳熟吧  - 那只兔子
- which was always suggestive. - The rabbit?

523
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,610
- 显然是被人监守自盗  - 你这么想的吗
- Clearly an inside job. - You reckon?

524
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,520
为什么  因为它在黑暗中会发光吗
Why? Because it glowed in the dark.

525
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,920

为什么没人通知我
Why wasn't I told?!

Major Barrymore, is it?

是啊  不错
Yes, well, good.

- ID unauthorised, sir. - What?

557
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,570
我刚接到一通电话
I've just had the call.

558
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,480
是吗  你们是谁
Is that right? Who are you?

559
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,680
听着  显然是哪里搞错了
Look, there's obviously been some kind of mistake.

560
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,690
显然没有  麦考夫・福尔摩斯
Clearly not, Mycroft Holmes.

561
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,800
是计算机出错了  少校  这都要写进报告里
Computer error, Major. It'll all have to go in the report.

562
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,210
这到底是怎么回事
What the hell's going on?

563
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,010
没事的  少校  我很清楚这两个人是谁
It's all right, Major, I know exactly who these gentlemen are.

564
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,210
- 是吗  - 是啊  我现在认人有点慢了
- You do? - Yeah, I'm getting a little slow on faces,

565
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,600
不过这位福尔摩斯先生
but Mr Holmes here

566
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,330
我是没想到会在这见到他
isn't someone I expected to show up in this place.

567
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,430
- 这个嘛...  - 很高兴又见面了  麦考夫
- Well... - Good to see you again, Mycroft.

568
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,230
我有幸在世界卫生组织大会上
I had the honour of meeting Mr Holmes

569
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:35,090
见过福尔摩斯先生  是在布鲁塞尔吧
at the WHO conference in... Brussels, was it?

570
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,040
- 是维也纳  - 维也纳  没错
- Vienna. - Vienna, that's it.

571
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,370
这位正是麦考夫・福尔摩斯  少校
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major.

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,770
显然是哪里搞错了
There's obviously been a mistake.

出了事唯你是问  弗兰克兰博士
On your head be it, Dr Frankland.

574
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,630
- 我送他们出去  下士  - 好的  先生
- I'll show them out, Corporal. - Very well, sir.

575
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,890
谢谢
Thank you.

576
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,590
你们是为亨利・奈特来的吧
This is about Henry Knight, isn't it?

577
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,340
我就猜到了
I thought so.

578
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,590
我知道他想找人帮忙  可没想到
I knew he wanted help, but I didn't realise

579
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,990
他会去找夏洛克・福尔摩斯
he was going to contact Sherlock Holmes!

580
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:15,550
别担心  我知道你们的真实身份
Don't worry, I know who you really are.

581
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,980
我一直看你的网站
I'm never off your website.

582
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,900
不过我以为你会戴那顶帽子呢  
I thought you'd be wearing the hat, though.

583
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,980
那不是我的帽子
That wasn't my hat.

584
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,660
他没戴帽子我差点没认出来  
I hardly recognise him without the hat.

585
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,560
说了不是我的帽子
It wasn't my hat.

586
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,270
- 你的博客我也很喜欢  华生医生  - 多谢
- I love the blog, too, Dr Watson. - Cheers.

587
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,280
粉色的那起案子
The pink thing.

588
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,860
- 还有铝拐杖那起  - 可不是
- And that one about the aluminium crutch. - Yes.

589
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,240
- 你认识亨利・奈特  - 我跟他父亲更熟
- You know Henry Knight? - Well, I knew his dad better.

590
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,420
他对这里有各种疯狂的看法
He had all sorts of mad theories about this place.

591
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,190
不过他很够朋友
Still, he was a good friend.

592
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,350
听着  我现在真的不方便说话
Listen, I can't really talk now.

593
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,660
这是我的手机号
Here's my cell number.

594
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,750
如果我能帮上亨利  给我打电话
If I can help with Henry, give me a call.

595
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,230
我还没问  弗兰克兰医生
I never did ask, Dr Frankland,

596
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,960
你在这儿到底是做什么的
what exactly is it that you do here?

597
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,050
福尔摩斯先生  我很想告诉你
Mr Holmes, I would love to tell you,

598
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,950
不过  当然啦  那样我就得杀你灭口了
but then, of course, I'd have to kill you.

599
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,660
那你这大话说得可有点太离谱了
That would be tremendously ambitious of you.

600
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,530
跟我说说斯坦佩顿博士
Tell me about Dr Stapleton.

601
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,050
我从不说同事的坏话
I never speak ill of a colleague.

602
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,810
但你也不想说他们好话
But you'd speak well of one, which you're clearly omitting to do.

603
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,840
确实如此  不是吗
I do seem to be, don't I?

604
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,560
- 回头联系你  - 没问题
- I'll be in touch. - Any time.

605
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,100
- 说说吧  - 说什么
- So? - So?

606
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,560
兔子的事是怎么回事
What was all that about the rabbit?

607
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,910
拜托  我们这次别来这套  行不行
Please, can we not do this, this time?

608
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:27,010
- 哪套  - 你一副神秘莫测的样子  板着脸
- Do what? - You being all mysterious with your... cheekbones,

609
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,350
还竖起大衣领子扮酷
and turning your coat collar up so you look cool.

610
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,010
- 我哪有  - 你就有
- I don't do that. - Yeah, you do.

611
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,260
这么说  柯丝蒂的那封电邮
So, the email from Kirsty.

612
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:52,080
失踪的夜光兔
The missing luminous rabbit.

613
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,250
柯丝蒂・斯坦佩顿
Kirsty Stapleton,

614
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,090
她妈妈专门搞基因操控
whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation.

615
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,650
她把自己女儿的兔子变成夜光的了
She made her daughter's rabbit glow in the dark?

616
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,180
大概加入了荧光基因
Probably a fluorescent gene.

617
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,480
从别处取出再植入样本体内  现在这不难办到
Removed and spliced into the specimen. Simple enough, these days.

618
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,010
所以呢
So?

619
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,420
所以我们就知道斯坦佩顿博士
So we know that Dr Stapleton

620
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,230
在拿动物进行秘密基因实验
performs secret genetic experiments on animals.

621
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,470
问题在于
The question is,

622
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,410
她有没有拿比兔子更致命的东西做实验
has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit?

623
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:22,440
公平地说  这个范围可有点广
To be fair, that is quite a wide field.

624
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,550
请进
Come in, come in.

625
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,740
这房子...
This is...

626
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,950
你...很有钱吗
Are you, um, rich?

627
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,480
- 是啊  - 了解
- Yeah. - Right.

628
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,090
有几个词
There's a couple of words,

629
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,810
我总是看见这几个词
it's what I keep seeing.

630
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,010
自由
Liberty.

631
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:14,900
自由
Liberty?

632
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,030
自由  还有
Liberty. And...

633
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,490
在
In.

634
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,070
就是这样
It's just that.

635
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,710
你不用了吗
Have you finished?

636
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,690
你想到什么了吗
Mean anything to you?

637
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,880
自由即死亡  是这么说的吧
Liberty in death, isn't that the expression?

638
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,180
死亡才是真正的解脱
The only true freedom.

639
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,460
那现在怎么办
What now, then?

640
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,200
- 夏洛克...有个计划吧  - 是的
- Sherlock's... got a plan? - Yes.

641
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,210
- 好  - 我们带你回荒野去
- Right. - We take you back out onto the moor.

642
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,220
- 好  - 看看有没有东西来袭击你  - 什么
- OK... - And see if anything attacks you. - What?

643
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,380
- 这应该能给我点线索  - 晚上吗
- That should bring things to a head. - At night?

644
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,980
你想要我晚上去那儿吗
You want me to go out there at night?

645
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,790
这就是你的计划吗  真不错
That's your plan? Brilliant!

646
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,280
- 你还有更好的办法吗  - 这不叫计划
- Got any better ideas? - That's not a plan.

647
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,730
约翰  如果那里真有怪兽
If there is a monster out there, John,

648
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,180
我们只能做一件事  找到它的窝
there's only one thing to do. Find out where it lives.

649
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,660
夏洛克...
Sherlock...

650
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,750
UMQRA
UMQRA...

651
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,620
安克拉...
UMQRA...

652
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,490
夏洛克
Sherlock...

653
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,070
危险

654
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:58,470
夏洛克...
Sherlock...

655
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,300
夏洛克...
Sherlock...

656
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,360
- 我遇见了你的一位朋友  - 什么
- Met a friend of yours? - What?

657
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,870
弗兰克兰博士
Dr Frankland?

658
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,590
鲍勃啊  是啊
Right. Bob, yeah.

659
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,270
他似乎很担心你
He seems pretty concerned about you.

660
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,020
他就是爱操心  保佑他
He's a worrier, bless him.

661
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,230
我回来后他一直对我很好
He's been very kind to me since I came back.

662
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,530
- 他认识你父亲吗  - 对
- He knew your father? - Yeah.

663
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,450
但他在巴斯克维尔工作
But he works at Baskerville.

664
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,300
你父亲不是对那里有意见吗
Didn't your dad have a problem with that?

665
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,970
可朋友到底是朋友  不是吗
Well, mates are mates, aren't they?

666
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,470
瞧瞧你和约翰
I mean, look at you and John.

667
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,630
我们怎么了
What about us?

668
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,700
我是说  他是个挺坦率的人  而你...
Well, I mean, he's a pretty straightforward bloke and you...

669
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,560
鲍勃叔叔和我爸爸说好不谈工作的事
Well, they agreed never to talk about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.

670
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,600
这里就是恶魔谷
Dewer's Hollow.

671
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,670
夏洛克...
Sherlock....

672
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:31,150
我的天  我的天  我的老天爷啊
My god, my god, my god! My god! My god!

673
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,540
你看见了吗
Did you see it?

674
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,620
你们听见了吗  
Did you hear that?

675
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,910
我们看见它了  我们看见了
We saw it. We saw it!

676
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,270
不  我什么都没看见
No, I didn't see anything.

677
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,270
什么  你说什么啊
What? What are you talking about?

678
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:59,660
我什么都没看见
I didn't see anything.

679
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,150
他肯定看见了
Look, he must have seen it.

680
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,160
我看见了  他肯定也看见了  肯定看见了
I saw it. He must have. He must have.

681
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,160
我...为什么  他为什么要那么说
I... Why? Why? Why would he say that?

682
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,920
它确实在那儿  真的
It was there, it was.

683
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,290
亨利  你得坐下
Henry, Henry, I need you to sit down.

684
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:21,240
- 请你放松下来  - 我没事  我很好
- Try and relax, please. - I'm OK, I feel OK.

685
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,420
我会给你点帮你入睡的东西  好吗
I'm going to give you something to help you sleep. All right?

686
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,270
这是好事  约翰
This is good news, John.

687
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,430
这...这是好事
It's... it's... it's good.

688
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,150
我没疯
I'm not crazy.

689
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,610
那里确实有猎犬  确实有
There is a hound there, there is.

690
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,040
夏洛克  他也看见了
And Sherlock, he saw it too.

691
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,420
不管他嘴上怎么说  他看见了
No matter what he says, he saw it.

692
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,460
他状态很不好  很狂躁
Well, he's in a pretty bad way. He's manic.

693
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,490
完全坚信有条...
Totally convinced there's some...

694
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,860
超级变种狗在荒野游荡
mutant super- dog roaming the moors.

695
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,500
不过没有这回事  对不对
And there isn't, though, is there?

696
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,410
如果人们在制造超级变种狗
Cos if people knew how to make a mutant super- dog,

697
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:07,640
我们肯定会知道
we'd know.

698
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,700
肯定会有的买  世道就这样
It'd be for sale. I mean, that's how it works.

699
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,940
听着  在荒野的时候我看见有人打信号
Listen, on the moor I saw someone signalling,

700
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,370
摩尔斯码
Morse.

701
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,970
我猜是摩尔斯码  不过似乎说不太通
I guess it's Morse. It doesn't seem to make much sense.

702
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,190
U  M  Q  R  A  有什么含义吗
U, M, Q, R, A, does that mean anything?

703
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:28,780
那好吧  我们都掌握了什么情况
So, OK, what have we got?

704
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,870
我们知道有脚印  因为亨利发现了
We know there's footprints, because Henry found them,

705
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,310
那个导游也发现了
and so did the tour guide bloke.

706
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,390
我们听到了什么声音
We all heard something.

707
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,380
或许我们该去找养了条大狗的人
Maybe we should just look for whoever's got a big dog.

708
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,370
- 亨利说得没错  - 什么
- Henry's right. - What?

709
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,980
我也看到了
I saw it, too.

710
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,400
- 什么  - 我也看到了  约翰
- What? - I saw it too, John.

711
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,580
等等  你看到什么了
Just... just a minute, you saw what?

712
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,880
猎犬  就在山谷那里
A hound. Out there in the Hollow.

713
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:03,960
一条巨大的猎犬
A gigantic hound.

714
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,410
听我说  夏洛克  我们得保持理智
Look, Sherlock, we have to be rational about this.

715
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,680
好了  你
OK, now you,

716
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,890
你是最不该...
of all people, can't just...

717
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,260
我们关注目前了解的情况  好吗
Let's just stick to what we know, yes?

718
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,450
只讲事实
Stick to the facts.

719
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,080
一旦你排除了所有的不可能
Once you've ruled out the impossible,

720
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,930
剩下的不管多么难以置信  一定就是真相
whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.

721
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,050
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

722
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,650
瞧瞧我  我害怕了  约翰
Look at me, I'm afraid, John.

723
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,060
居然害怕了
Afraid.

724
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,020
夏洛克
Sherlock.

725
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:46,410
我一直都冷眼旁观
I've always been able to keep myself distant.

726
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:51,560
不动感情
Divorce myself from feelings.

727
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,550
可你瞧  我的身体背叛了我
But look, you see, body's betraying me.

728
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,990
有意思  是啊  动感情了
Interesting, yes, emotions.

729
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,250
白璧微瑕  美中不足
The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment.

730
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,250
好吧
Yeah, all right,

731
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,240
斯波克  放松点
Spock, just... take it easy.

732
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,240
斯波克  星际迷航里的人物  来自高智慧零情感的种族

733
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,890
你最近一直都很兴奋  这你知道
You've been pretty wired lately, you know you have.

734
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,760
我觉得你刚刚走的这趟
I think you've just gone out there

735
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,410
- 把自己搞得有点激动了  - 激动
- and got yourself a bit worked up. - Worked up?

736
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,920
刚刚又黑又吓人
It was dark and scary.

737
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,900
我吗  我什么事都没有
Me? There's nothing wrong with me.

738
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,120
夏洛克
Sherlock...

739
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,640
- 夏洛...  - 我什么事都没有  懂吗
- Sherl... - There is nothing wrong with me! Do you understand!?

740
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,370
你要让我证明吗
You want me to prove it, yes?

741
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,990
我们要找的是条狗  巨大的狗
We're looking for a dog, yes? A great big dog,

742
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,750
你的天才论断  是在找狗[法语]
that's your brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien!

743
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,520
很好  非常棒
Good! Excellent! Yes.

744
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,340
那我们从何开始  从他们如何
Where shall we start? How about them?

745
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,120
伤心的寡妇  和她失业的渔夫儿子
The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman.

746
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,340
- 答案是她有狗  - 有吗
- The answer's yes. - Yes?

747
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,610
她养了条西部高原小猎犬  名叫威士忌
She's got a West Highland Terrier called Whisky,

748
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,990
但不是我们要找的目标
not exactly what we're looking for!

749
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,030
- 拜托  - 看他的毛衣  几乎全新
- For God's sake! - Look at his jumper, hardly worn.

750
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,180
显然穿着很不自在
Clearly he's uncomfortable.

751
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,090
可能是因为材质或图案太丑
Could be the material or the hideous pattern,

752
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,830
毛衣应该是别人送的  多半是圣诞礼物
suggests it's a present, probably Christmas.

753
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,570
他想讨母亲欢心  为什么  多半是为钱
He wants into his mother's good books. Why? Probably money.

754
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,950
他请母亲来吃饭  自己那份点的却很少
He's treating her to a meal, but his own portion is small.

755
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:12,230
是想感动她
He wants to impress her,

756
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:13,790
却在自己那份上省钱
but he's trying to economise on his own food.

757
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,170
或许他不饿吧
Maybe he's not hungry.

758
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:18,380
不  小盘前菜  他连盆子都快舔干净了
No, small plate, starter. He's practically licked it clean.

759
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,840
而她连蛋白水果甜饼都没吃完
She's nearly finished her pavlova.

760
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,170
若是她请客  他完全可以放开了吃
If she'd treated him, he'd have had as much as he wanted.

761
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,420
他手头没钱  饥寒交迫
He's hungry and not well- off,

762
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,160
你可以看他的袖口和鞋
you can tell by his cuffs and shoes.

763
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:27,700
只有母亲会送他那样的圣诞礼物
Only a mother would give him a Christmas present like that.

764
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,750
当然也可能是姑姑或长姐  但母亲最有可能
It could be an aunt or older sister, but mother's more likely.

765
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,960
他曾是渔夫
He was a fisherman,

766
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,550
手上的疤痕很独特  是鱼钩造成
the scarring on his hands is distinctive, fish hooks.

767
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,300
伤疤是很久前的了  说明失业已久
They're old, suggesting long- term unemployment.

768
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,630
这里工业并不发达
Not much industry here,

769
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,350
所以他才找自己的寡母求助
so he's turned to his widowed mother for help.

770
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,580
是寡母吗  当然  明摆着
Widowed? Yes, obviously.

771
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,490
她项链里挂了个男戒
She's got a man's wedding ring on a chain around her neck,

772
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,700
明显是她丈夫的  她自己戴太大了
clearly her late husband's and too big for her finger.

773
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,170
她衣着精致  但首饰都是便宜货
She's well- dressed, but her jewellery is cheap.

774
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,710
她可以戴更好的  但一直留作纪念  多愁善感
She could afford better, but she's kept it, sentimental.

775
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:52,330
我怎么知道她养狗  她腿上有小细毛
The dog? There are tiny hairs on her leg

776
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:53,190
但都不超过膝盖
but none above the knees,

777
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,070
说明是条小狗  估计是小猎犬
suggesting it's a small dog, probably a terrier.

778
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:56,750
是条名叫威士忌的西部高原小猎犬
It is a West Highland Terrier called Whisky.

779
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,060
夏洛克  你怎么会知道
"How do you know that, Sherlock?"

780
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,120
她跟我们同一辆火车过来
She was on the same train as us

781
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,610
我有听到她喊  那不是作弊  而是善于倾听
and I heard her call its name. That's not cheating, that's listening.

782
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:04,460
我会利用自己的感官  不像某些人  所以我很好
I use my senses, unlike some people, so you see, I am fine.

783
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,040
而且是好得不能再好  所以别吵我了
In fact, I've never been better, so just leave me alone!

784
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,340
好吧
Yeah, OK.

785
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,830
好
Ok.

786
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,540
你干嘛要听我的话
Why would you listen to me?

787
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,220
- 我只是你朋友  - 我没有朋友
- I'm just your friend. - I don't have friends.

788
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,540
没有吗
No.

789
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,600
怪不得没有
I wonder why.

790
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:42,130
塞尔登先生  你又来了
Mr Selden, you've done it again!

791
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:45,450
我的皮带老弄不下来
I keep catching it with my belt.

792
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,270
天哪
God!

793
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,050
亨利的心理医生现在在十字键酒馆
夏

794
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,430
那又如何

795
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,320
那有如何
So?

796
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,250
想找她聊聊吗

797
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,400
那又如何

798
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,200
图片下载中. . . . .

799
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,850
你真是太讨厌了
You're a bad man.

800
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,170
真是太刻薄了
That's so mean!

801
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:06,110
- 再来点酒吗  医生  - 你是要灌醉我吗  医生
- More wine, doctor? - Are you trying to get me drunk, doctor?

802
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,670
怎么可能
The thought never occurred.

803
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,020
因为我刚还以为你在搭讪我
Because a while ago I thought you were chatting me up.

804
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:12,770
那我是什么时候露的馅
Where did I go wrong?

805
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:14,630
你开始跟我打听我的病人
When you started asking about my patients.

806
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,480
我是亨利的老朋友
Well, I am one of Henry's oldest friends.

807
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,200
而他是我的病人  我不能说他的事
Yeah, and he's one of my patients, so I can't talk about him.

808
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,580
当然他有跟我提过他的老朋友
Although he has told me about all his oldest friends.

809
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,660
- 你是其中哪位  - 新的那位
- Which one are you? - A new one?

810
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,660
那他父亲呢  他不是你病人了吧
OK, what about his father? He wasn't one of your patients.

811
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,280
他是那种阴谋论疯子...阴谋论专家吗
Wasn't he some sort of conspiracy nutter... theorist?

812
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,040
- 只有你错了才是疯了  - 那他说得对吗
- You're only a nutter if you're wrong. - And was he wrong?

813
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,660
- 我认为他是  - 他念念不忘巴斯克维尔
- I should think so. - But he got fixated on Baskerville, didn't he?

814
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,190
执着于查明那里面到底在做什么
With what they were doing in there.

815
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,470
有没有可能亨利也一样  幻想出一条猎犬
Couldn't Henry have gone the same way, started imagining a hound?

816
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:47,420
为什么你觉得我会谈这些
Why do you think I'll talk about this?

817
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:49,210
因为我觉得你很担心他
Because I think you're worried about him

818
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,890
因为我也是医生
and because I'm a doctor too.

819
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,170
因为我另外一位朋友
And because I have another friend

820
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,670
他可能也有了同样的问题
who might be having the same problem.

821
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,760
华生医生
Dr Watson!

822
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,030
调查进展如何了
How's the investigation going?

823
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,360
什么  什么调查
What, investigation?

824
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,000
你不知道吗  你没看过那个博客吗  夏洛克・福尔摩斯
Didn't you know? Don't you read the blog? Sherlock Holmes.

825
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
- 是这样  - 夏洛克什么
- It's... - Sherlock who?

826
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:21,140
- 私人侦探  这位是他的私人助理  - 私人助理
- Private detective. This is his PA. - PA?

827
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,830
- 同居在一起的私人助理  - 很好
- Well, live- in PA. - Perfect!

828
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:24,540
同居
Live- in..?

829
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:27,370
这位是莫蒂默医生  亨利的心理医生
This is Dr Mortimer, Henry's therapist.

830
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,980
你好  我是鲍勃・弗兰克兰
Hello. Bob Frankland.

831
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,970
告诉夏洛克  我会盯着斯坦佩顿
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been keeping an eye on Stapleton.

832
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:38,270
他想找我聊随时都可以  好吗
Any time he wants a little chat. All right?

833
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:47,850
何不请他喝一杯  他好像很喜欢你
Why don't you buy him a drink? I think he likes you.

834
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,080
早  睡得好吗
Morning! How are you feeling?

835
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:12,600
我
I...

836
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:15,180
- 睡得不好  - 真可惜 
- I didn't sleep very well. - That's a shame.

837
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,640
我来泡点咖啡吧  看  你房子渗水了
Shall I make us some coffee? Look, you've got damp!

838
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,340
听着  昨晚...
Listen, last night...

839
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,210
你为什么说自己什么都没看到
Why did you say you hadn't seen anything?

840
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:50,580
- 我明明看到那条猎犬  但  - 是猎犬吗
- I mean, I only saw the hound for a minute, but... - Hound?

841
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,150
- 什么  - 你为什么要说它是猎犬
- What? - Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound?

842
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,340
- 你什么意思  - 很奇怪吧
- Why? What do you mean? - It's odd, isn't it?

843
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,400
你选这词很奇怪  年代久远了
It's a strange choice of words, archaic.

844
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,090
所以我才接了这案子
That's why I took the case.

845
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:02,940
福尔摩斯先生  那是头巨型猎犬的脚印
"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound."

846
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,090
为什么要说"猎犬"
Why say "Hound"?

847
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:05,950
我不知道  我从没...
I don't know, I've never...

848
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,530
咖啡还是算了吧
Actually, I'd better skip the coffee.

849
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,670
那摩斯电码有头绪了吗
Did you get anywhere with that Morse code?

850
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,710
U M Q R A  是这样吗  安克拉
U, M, Q, R, A, wasn't it? Umqra.

851
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,590
没什么
Nothing.

852
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,720
算了吧  我以为自己发现了什么  其实不是
Look, forget it. I thought I was onto something, I wasn't.

853
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,430
- 确定吗  - 确定
- Sure? - Yeah.

854
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,380
- 露易丝・莫蒂默那边呢  有什么发现吗  - 没有
- How about Louise Mortimer, did you get anywhere with her? - No.

855
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,780
太糟糕了  但你这边有什么消息吗
Too bad. But did you get any information?

856
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,820
你现在幽默多了
You're being funny now?

857
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,020
说不定能打破点僵局呢
Thought it might break the ice, a bit.

858
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,600
幽默不适合你  还是冷一点好
Funny doesn't suit you. Let's stick to ice.

859
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,570
- 约翰  - 我没事
- John... - It's fine.

860
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,160
等等  昨晚的事...
Wait, what happened last night...

861
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,480
是因为我有了前所未有的感觉
something happened to me something I've not experienced before.

862
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,330
你说了  你害怕了  夏洛克・福尔摩斯害怕了
Yes, you said. Fear, Sherlock Holmes got scared, you said.

863
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:17,350
不仅如此  约翰  是我开始怀疑了
It was more than that, John. It was doubt.

864
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,260
我感觉到怀疑
I felt doubt.

865
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,130
我一直能相信自己的感觉
I've always been able to trust my senses,

866
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,600
相信眼见为实的证据  直到昨晚
the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.

867
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,930
你不能相信自己看到了某种怪物
You can't actually believe that you saw some kind of monster?

868
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,710
是  我不相信
No, I can't believe that.

869
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,410
但我确实看到了  所以问题是  怎么会看到
But I did see it, so the question is, how? How?

870
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,750
是啊
Yes.

871
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:36,810
很好
Yeah, right, good.

872
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,110
这么说你有头绪了  祝好运
So you've got something to go on, then. Good luck with that.

873
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:45,400
约翰  我之前说的话  是真心的
Listen, what I said before, John, I meant it.

874
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,110
我没有朋友
I don't have friends.

875
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,790
身边就只有你
I've just got one.

876
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:56,660
好吧
Right.

877
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:00,790
约翰
John.

878
00:53:01,450 --> 00:53:04,880
约翰  你简直太神奇太了不起了
John! You are amazing! You are fantastic!

879
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,070
我知道了  你不用这么夸张
Yes, all right, you don't have to overdo it.

880
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,460
你或许不是发光的人
You may not be the most luminous of people,

881
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,990
但你是传递光的人  无与伦比
but as a conductor of light, you are unbeatable.

882
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,250
多谢  什么
Cheers. What?

883
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:13,500
有些人不是天才
Some people who aren't geniuses

884
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
却有着激发天才的非凡能力
have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others.

885
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,490
你刚不在道歉呢嘛  别这么快就扫兴好吗
You were saying sorry a minute ago. Don't spoil it.

886
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,560
我做什么了  这么能激发人
So what have I done that's so bloody stimulating?

887
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,000
猎犬

888
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,030
什么
Yeah?

889
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:26,360
如果这不是一个词  而是单独的字母呢
What if it's not a word, what if it is individual letters?

890
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,750
你觉得这个是首字母缩写词吗
You think it's an acronym?

891
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:30,840
完全没头绪  不过...
Absolutely no idea, but...

892
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,370
你在这里搞什么鬼
What the hell are you doing here?!

893
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,040
我也很高兴见到你
Nice to see you too

894
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,110
- 我在度假  你信吗  - 我不信
- I'm on holiday, would you believe? - No, I wouldn't.

895
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:40,580
- 你好  约翰  - 格雷格
- Hello, John. - Greg.

896
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,810
听说你们在这边  忙什么呢
I heard you were in the area. What are you up to?

897
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:45,990
追查电视里说的那条地狱犬吗
Are you after this Hound of Hell, like on the telly?

898
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,070
你还没解释呢  探长  你为什么会在这里
I'm waiting for an explanation, Inspector, why are you here?

899
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:50,210
我说过了  我在度假
I've told you, I'm on holiday.

900
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,060
你晒得这么黑
You're brown as a nut.

901
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,360
明显是刚度假回来
You're clearly just back from your holidays.

902
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,130
我还想再度一个
I fancied another one.

903
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,710
是麦考夫搞的鬼吧  当然是了
This is Mycroft, isn't it? Of course it is.

904
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,840
听到巴斯克维尔出了事
One mention of Baskerville

905
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,910
就派我的监护人来暗中监视我  还用化名
and he sends down my handler to spy on me, incognito.

906
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:06,180
- 所以你才自称什么"格雷格"  - 他本来就叫那个名字
- Is that why you're calling yourself "Greg"? - That's his name.

907
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,260
- 是吗  - 没错  你压根就没关心过吧
- Is it? - Yes. If you'd ever bothered to find out.

908
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:10,960
听好  我不是你的监护人
Look, I'm not your handler.

909
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,460
我只是被你哥哥使唤惯了
And I just do what your brother tells me.

910
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,820
- 事实上  你来得正好  - 为什么
- Actually, you could be just the man we want. - Why?

911
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:18,530
我可没闲着  夏洛克
Well, I've not been idle, Sherlock.

912
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,420
我可能找到了点线索  这里
I think I might have found something. Here.

913
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,420
我之前不知道是不是有关系
I didn't know if it was relevant.

914
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,000
不过现在看上去似乎有点意思
Starting to look like it might be.

915
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,050
素食餐厅  可用不了这么多肉啊
That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant.

916
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,550
太棒了
Excellent.

917
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:30,420
有了亲切又恐怖的苏格兰场探长
A nice, scary inspector from Scotland Yard,

918
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:33,420
只要几通电话就能摆平  超便利
who can put in a few calls, might come in very handy.

919
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,270
点单
Shop.

920
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,500
这是什么
What's this?

921
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,850
- 咖啡  我泡了咖啡  - 你从来不泡咖啡
- Coffee. I made coffee. - You never make coffee.

922
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:57,610
- 你不想喝吗  - 你不用没完没了地道歉
- Don't you want it? - You don't have to keep apologising.

923
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
谢谢
Thanks.

924
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,880
我不加糖
I don't take sugar.

925
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:15,640
这些记录可追溯到将近两个月前
These records go back nearly two months.

926
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,020
很好喝  很香
That's nice. It's good.

927
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:21,110
你们是在电视播出后  想到这主意的吗
Is that when you had the idea, after the TV show went out?

928
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,900
是我  是我的错
It's me. It was me.

929
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,480
抱歉  盖瑞  我忍不住
I'm sorry, Gary. I couldn't help it.

930
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,800
我在卡尔婚礼上吃了个熏肉三明治
I had a bacon sandwich at Cal's wedding

931
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,150
- 然后就一发不可收拾了  - 好借口  
- and one thing led to another. - Nice try.

932
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,680
我们只是想办法
Look, we were just trying to

933
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,270
添油加醋了一番  好吗
give things a bit of a boost, you know?

934
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,510
荒野里有条失踪的大狗
Let a great big dog run wild up on the moor,

935
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,600
简直是天赐良机
it was heaven- sent.

936
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,790
就像我们有了自己的尼斯湖水怪
It was like us having our own Loch Ness monster.

937
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,010
你们把它关在哪
And where do you keep it?

938
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,910
那边有个老矿井  不太远
There's an old mine shaft. It's not too far.

939
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,940
- 它本来在那挺好  - 本来
- He was all right there. - Was?

940
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:51,800
我们控制不住那畜生了
We couldn't control the bloody thing.

941
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:53,510
它实在太凶残
It was vicious.

942
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,890
然后  一个月前
And then, a month ago,

943
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:01,770
比利带它去了兽医那里  然后...
Billy took him to the vet and, you know...

944
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:02,990
它死了吗
He's dead?

945
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,310
我们杀了它
Put down.

946
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,170
对  我们别无选择
Yeah. No choice.

947
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,020
一切都结束了
So it's over.

948
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:11,570
这只是个玩笑
It was just a joke, you know.

949
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,390
是啊  很好笑
Yeah, hilarious

950
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,350
你们差点把一个人逼疯掉
You've nearly driven a man out of his mind.

951
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,600
其实他很高兴你来了
You know he's actually pleased you're here?

952
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,060
偷偷高兴着呢
Secretly pleased.

953
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:38,920
是吗
Is he?

954
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:41,090
不错
That's nice.

955
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,510
估计他就是喜欢所有熟人凑在一起
I suppose he likes having all the same faces back together.

956
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,410
- 以满足他的...  - 阿斯伯格综合症吗
- Appeals to his... his... - Asperger's?

957
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,410
自闭症的一种  一般被认为是没有智能障碍的自闭症

958
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,170
你相信他们杀掉那条狗了吗
So, you believe them about having the dog destroyed?

959
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:53,070
没理由不相信
No reason not to.

960
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,930
希望没造成什么伤害
Well, hopefully there's no harm done.

961
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:56,680
我也不确定该以什么罪名起诉他们
I'm not quite sure what I'd charge them with, anyway.

962
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,250
先跟本地警方谈谈再说
I'll have a word with the local force.

963
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,010
好  就这样吧  回头见
Right, that's that, then. Catch you later.

964
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:03,430
我很喜欢这里
I'm enjoying this.

965
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,900
伦敦的污浊气一扫而空的感觉真好
It's nice to get London out of your lungs.

966
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,490
人们在荒野上看到的就是他们的狗吗
So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor?

967
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,450
貌似是的
Looks like it.

968
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,740
但不是你看到的那条  那不是普通的狗
But that wasn't what you saw, that wasn't just an ordinary dog.

969
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:14,840
没错  它体型庞大
No. It was immense.

970
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,220
目如赤焰  还在发光  约翰
It had burning red eyes, and it was glowing, John,

971
00:57:17,230 --> 00:57:20,500
它全身都在发光
its whole body was glowing.

972
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,560
我有个猜想
I've got a theory,

973
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,680
但还得回巴斯克维尔验证一下
but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it.

974
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:29,260
怎么去  上次的把戏不能再用了
How? Can't pull off the ID trick again.

975
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,170
也没必要再用
Might not have to.

976
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:36,710
喂  亲爱的哥哥  你好吗
Hello, brother, dear. How ARE you?

977
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,830
下午好  先生  请关闭引擎
Afternoon, sir. Can you turn the engine off?

978
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,190
谢谢
Thank you.

979
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:07,600
我一进去就得去找巴里莫尔少校
I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside.

980
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,670
- 好的  - 所以
- Right. - Which means

981
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,000
- 你来找那条猎犬  - 好
you'll have to start the search for the hound. - OK.

982
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,230
在实验室找  先找斯坦佩顿那里
In the labs. Stapleton's first.

983
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:15,990
可能会很危险
It could be dangerous.

984
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,590
你也知道我很乐意
Oh, you know I'd love to.

985
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:34,920
我当然乐意让你在这里为所欲为
I'd love to give you unlimited access to this place.

986
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:35,490
为什么不呢
Why not?

987
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,100
这个请求很简单  少校
It's a simple enough request, Major.

988
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,760
我可从没听过这么荒谬的说法
I've never heard of anything so bizarre.

989
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,060
你要给我24小时
You're to give me 24 hours,

990
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,290
- 这是说定了的  - 一秒也不许多待
- it's what I negotiated. - Not a second more.

991
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,340
我不得不服从命令
I may have to comply with this order,

992
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:46,760
但我不必非要喜欢
but I don't have to like it.

993
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,260
我不明白你究竟想在这找到什么
I don't know what the hell you expect to find here, anyway.

994
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,590
- 或许是真相  - 什么真相
- Perhaps the truth. - About what?

995
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,810
我懂了
Oh, I see.

996
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,680
瞧你这身打扮  我早该看出来
The big coat should have told me.

997
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:58,070
你也是个相信阴谋论的家伙吧
You're one of the conspiracy lot, aren't you?

998
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,970
那好  去吧  发掘真相吧
Well, then, go ahead, seek them out,

999
00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:04,340
什么怪物  致命射线  外星人
the monsters, the death rays, the aliens.

1000
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,650
你这有这些东西吗
Have you got any of those?

1001
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:07,590
我就是好奇而已
Oh, just wondering.

1002
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,850
有两个  60年代在这里坠机了
A couple. Crash landed here in the '60s.

1003
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,600
我们叫它们两傻组合
We call them Abbott and Costello.

1004
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,600
两傻组合  喜剧演员
善于恶搞惊悚题材

1005
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,920
祝你好运  福尔摩斯先生
Good luck, Mr Holmes.

1006
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:47,560
天啊
God!

1007
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:35,750
请勿靠近  除非你想感冒

1008
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,470
天啊
Oh. God. Ow.

1009

禁止通行

1013
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:05,940
有人吗
Hello?

1014
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:32,990
别  拜托了  拜托了
No, come on. Come on.

1015
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:47,030
多幼稚  别胡思乱想
Naive. Don't be ridiculous.

1016
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:48,510
接电话呀
Pick up.

1017
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,350
该死
Damn it.

1018
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:52,090
好吧
Right.

1019
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,830
它在这儿  跟我在一个房间里
It's here. It's in here with me.

1020
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:01,860
你在哪儿
Where are you?

1021
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,030
把我救出去  夏洛克  你得救我出去
Get me out, Sherlock, you've got to get me out.

1022
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,170
我在大实验室  我们看的第一个实验室
The big lab, the first lab that we saw.

1023
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,340
约翰  约翰
John... John?

1024
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,610
现在就来  夏洛克  求你了
Now, Sherlock! Please!

1025
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,910
好  我这就来找你  你接着说话
All right, I'll find you. Keep talking.

1026
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,870
不行  它会听到我
I can't, it'll hear me.

1027
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,040
接着说  你看到什么了
Keep talking. What are you seeing?

1028
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:30,840
- 约翰  - 我听着呢
- John? - Yes, I'm here.

1029
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,330
你看见什么了
What can you see?

1030
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:42,360
我不知道  但我能听见它的声音
I don't know. I don't know, but I can hear it now.

1031
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:45,890
你听到了吗
Did you hear that?

1032
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:48,370
冷静  保持冷静  你能看见它吗

I can see it.

1036
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,370
它在这儿
It's here. It's here.

1037
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:11,460
你还好吗  约翰
Are you all right? John?

1038
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:14,070
我的老天  就是那条猎犬
Jesus Christ! It was the hound!

1039
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:17,040
夏洛克  它就在这  我发誓
Sherlock, it was here, I swear it,

1040
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,090
夏洛克  它肯定是...
Sherlock, it must, it must...

1041
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,410
你看见它了吗  你肯定看见了
Did- did you see it? You must have!

1042
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:25,250
没事了  现在没事了
It's all right, it's OK now.

1043
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:28,620
不  才怪  怎么会没事  
No, it's not! It's not ok!

1044
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:30,920
我看见它了  之前是我错了
I saw it, I was wrong!

1045
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,470
- 别急着下结论  - 什么
- Well, let's not jump to conclusions. - What?

1046
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,280
你看见什么了
What did you see?

1047
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:35,820
我说过了  我看到那条猎犬了
I told you, i saw the hound.

1048
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,140
- 体型巨大  目如赤焰  - 没错
- Huge, red eyes? - Yes.

1049
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:37,810
- 发着光  - 是的
- Glowing? - Yeah.

1050
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:38,990
- 不  - 什么
- No. - What?

1051
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:40,760
发光那部分是我编的
I made up the bit about glowing.

1052
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,900
你听过我的描述  所以以为自己看到了
You saw what you expected to see because I told you.

1053
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,990
你被下了药  我们都中招了
You have been drugged. We have all been drugged.

1054
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,740
下药
Drugged?

1055
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,420
- 你还能走吗  - 当然
- Can you walk? - Of course I can walk.

1056
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,530
来吧  是时候摆平这妖孽了
Come on, then. It's time to lay this ghost.

1057
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,470
又来了
Oh, Back again?

1058
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,350
这次又是为什么
What's on your mind this time?

1059
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,840
这是谋杀  斯坦佩顿医生
Murder, Dr Stapleton.

1060
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:06,920
精心策划  冷血无情的谋杀
Refined, cold- blooded murder.

1061
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,490
是你来为小柯丝蒂揭开
Will you tell little Kirsty

1062
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,370
铃兰的失踪之谜呢  还是我来
what happened to Bluebell, or shall I?

1063
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,950
好吧  你究竟想怎样
OK. What do you want?

1064
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:20,340
能借你显微镜一用吗
Can I borrow your microscope?

1065
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:27,290
氢

1066
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,680
水

1067
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:33,790
水

1068
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:38,520
你真的没事吗
Are you sure you're OK?

1069
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,490
你看起来很憔悴
You look very peaky.

1070
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:41,540
不  我很好
No, I'm all right.

1071
01:07:44,330 --> 01:07:46,120
是水母的绿色荧光蛋白基因
It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish,

1072
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,210
要是你好奇的话
in case you're interested.

1073
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:47,850
什么
What?

1074
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,400
- 让兔子发亮的  - 对  没错
- In the rabbits. - Right, yeah.

1075
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,740
基因取自水晶水母  如果你想知道的话
Aequorea victoria, if you really want to know.

1076
01:07:53,870 --> 01:07:56,190
- 为什么这么做  - 为什么不呢
- Why? - Why not?

1077
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:59,340
我们现在不想这种问题  试验还没完成
We don't ask questions like that here. It isn't done.

1078
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:00,750
总之这是个基因混合体
It was a mix- up, anyway.

1079
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,360
我发现女儿的宠物竟是试验样品
My daughter ended up with one of the lab specimens,

1080
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:05,980
可怜的铃兰不得不消失了
so poor Bluebell had to go.

1081
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,390
- 你可真够慈悲  - 我知道
- Your compassion is overwhelming! - I know.

1082
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,560
有时我也讨厌自己这一点
I hate myself sometimes.

1083
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:16,090
那好  你可以信任我  我也是个医生
So, come on, then, you can trust me, I'm a doctor,

1084
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,980
你这还藏了什么不可告人的东西
what else have you got hidden away up here?

1085
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:21,550
听着  你好好想想
Listen, if you can imagine it,

1086
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,060
其他地方可能也有人从事这种研究
someone is probably doing it somewhere.

1087
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,300
这是肯定的
Of course they are.

1088
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,050
克隆吗
Cloning?

1089
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,790
当然  克隆羊多利  还记得吗
Yes, of course. Dolly the Sheep, remember?

1090
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,400
- 克隆人呢  - 有何不可
- Human cloning? - Why not?

1091
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,080
还有什么克隆动物  除了羊
And what about animals? Not sheep.

1092
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:41,990
大型的动物
Big animals.

1093
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,180
体型大小不难控制  小菜一碟
Size isn't a problem. Not at all.

1094
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,420
唯一的约束就是伦理与法律
The only limits are ethics and the law and

1095
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:49,460
但这些都可以变通
both those things can be very flexible.

1096
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:51,260
但在这不是  在巴斯克威尔不是
But not here, not at Baskerville.

1097
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,300
老天  什么都没有  说不通呀
Jesus! Nothing there! It doesn't make any sense!

1098
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,070
你以为能找到什么
What were you expecting to find?

1099
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:58,790
当然是某种药物  肯定有某种药物
A drug, of course. It has to be a drug.

1100
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:01,430
可以引发幻觉或精神错乱之类
An hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind.

1101
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,630
糖里什么都没有
There's no trace of anything in the sugar.

1102
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,280
- 糖  - 糖  是的
- Sugar? - Sugar, yes.

1103
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,600
简单的排除法
A simple process of elimination.

1104
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,140
我看到了猎犬  当然那是我的幻觉
I saw the hound, saw it as my imagination expected me to see it.

1105
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,650
让我以为那是个转基因怪物
A genetically engineered monster.

1106
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,020
我知道自己看到的是假象
I knew I couldn't believe the evidence with my eyes,

1107
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,520
所以可能有七种解释
so there were seven possible reasons for it,

1108
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:18,880
最有可能的一种就是药物影响
the most possible being narcotics.

1109
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:20,700
亨利・奈特  他也看见了
Henry Knight, he saw it too,

1110
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:23,060
但你没有  约翰  你没看见
but you didn't, John. You didn't see it.

1111
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,720
自从来到格林盆  我们吃的喝的
We have eaten and drunk exactly the same things

1112
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,850
都一模一样  只有一个例外
since we got to Grimpen, apart from one thing.

1113
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:31,010
- 你喝咖啡不加糖  - 懂了  然后呢
- You don't take sugar in your coffee. - I see, so?

1114
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,160
我从亨利的厨房里拿了点糖
I took it from Henry's kitchen, his sugar.

1115
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,770
但它完全没问题
It's perfectly all right.

1116
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:38,600
- 或许并非药物所致  - 不  肯定是
- But maybe it's not a drug. - No, it has to be a drug.

1117
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,240
药物究竟是如何进入我们的身体
How did it get into our systems? How?

1118
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,210
肯定有些什么东西
There has to be something, something...

1119
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:49,790
一些
Something...

1120
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:54,120
一些藏得很深的线索
Something buried deep.

1121
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:57,050
- 出去  - 什么
- Get out. - What?

1122
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,190
出去  我要进入我的思维殿堂
Get out, I need to go to my mind palace.

1123
01:09:59,190 --> 01:09:59,800
你的什么
Your what?

1124
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,920
这种时候他会变得少言寡语
He's not going to be doing much talking for a while,

1125
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,240
我们还是出去吧
we may as well go.

1126
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:09,720
- 他的什么  - 他的思维殿堂
- His what? - His "Mind Palace".

1127
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,760
这是一种记忆方式  一种思维地图
It's a memory technique, a sort of mental map.

1128
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,430
你在地图上绘制地点
You plot a map with a location,

1129
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:17,280
不必是真实的地点
it doesn't have to be a real place.

1130
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,140
把记忆存储在那里
You deposit memories there.

1131
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:20,830
理论上来说  这样你什么都不会遗忘
Theoretically, you never forget anything.

1132
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,370
只要找对途径  就能找回记忆
All you do is find your way back to it.

1133
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:24,390
所以这种意念化地点可以是任何场所
So this imaginary location could be anything,

1134
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,190
- 比方一座房子或一条街  - 是的
- a house or a street? - Yeah.

1135
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:28,370
可他说是"殿堂"  他说那是殿堂
But he said "palace", he said it was a palace?

1136
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:29,930
是啊  他就这德性  还能咋样
Yeah, well, he would, wouldn't he?

01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,670
其实不是动物吧  亨利
It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry?

1348
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:55,840
不是个怪物
Not a monster.

1349
01:18:57,290 --> 01:18:58,610
而是个人
A man.

1350
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,820
你还只是个孩子  你接受不了
You couldn't cope. You were just a child.

1351
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:47,920
所以你把它解释成很奇怪的东西
So you rationalised it into something very different.

1352
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:51,000
但你开始想起来了  有人要阻止你
Then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped.

1353
01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:52,400
把你逼疯
Driven out of your mind

1354
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,340
这样就没人会相信你说的话
so that no- one would believe a word that you said.

1355
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,670
夏洛克
Sherlock!

1356
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,110
没事的
It's OK.

1357
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:00,050
没事了  伙计
It's OK, mate.

1358
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:05,140
但我们看到了猎犬  那天晚上  我们都看到了
But we saw it, the hound, last night. We did, we s...

1359
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,420
不  是有条狗  亨利
No, but there was a dog, Henry,

1360
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,880
留下脚印  惊吓路人
leaving footprints, scaring witnesses,

1361
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:11,790
但那不过是条普通的狗
but nothing more than an ordinary dog.

1362
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:15,630
因为我们中毒了  所以我们的想象变成了事实
We both saw it, saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it.

1363
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,730
恐惧和刺激  就是这么回事
Fear and stimulus, that's how it works.

1364
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,510
但其实根本就没有什么怪物
But there never was any monster.

1365
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:27,770
夏洛克
Sherlock?

1366
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:32,140
- 不  不要  - 亨利  - 夏洛克
- No! No, no, no, no! - Henry, Henry... - Sherlock!

1367
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:34,870
不  不要
No, no! No, no, no, noooo!

1368
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:35,960
亨利
Henry.

1369
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:41,640
夏洛克  你看到了吗
Sherlock, are you seeing this?

1370
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:44,280
好吧  他没被下药  夏洛克  那是什么
Right, he is not drugged, Sherlock, so what's that?

1371
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:45,980
- 不  - 到底是什么
- No! - What is it?!

1372
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:47,700
好吧  它还在这儿
All right, it's still here.

1373
01:20:48,570 --> 01:20:50,440
但只是条狗  亨利
But it's just a dog, Henry.

1374
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:53,200
一条普通的狗罢了
It's nothing more than an ordinary dog.

1375
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:54,520
上帝啊
My god!

1376
01:20:57,700 --> 01:20:58,790
老天爷
Christ!

1377
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:14,440
不
No. No!

1378
01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:24,460
不是你  不可能是你
It's not you, not you!

1379
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,730
- 是烟雾  - 什么  - 是这里的雾  雾里有毒
- The fog. - What? - It's the fog, the drug, it's in the fog!

1380
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,920
气态传播  记录里就是这么写的
Aerosol dispersant, that's what it said in the records.

1381
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,840
猎犬计划  是雾
Project HOUND, it's the fog!

1382
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,620
化学雷区
A chemical minefield.

1383
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,500
老天爷  快杀了它
For God's sake, kill it! Kill it!

1384
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:00,220
看看  亨利
Look at it, Henry.

1385
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,430
- 不  - 快看
- No, no, no. - Come on, look at it!

1386
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,560
你个混蛋
You bastard.

1387
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,050
王八蛋
You... bastard!

1388
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:18,120
- 20年了  我白白痛苦了20年  - 现在都结束了
- 20 years! 20 years of my life, making no sense! - It's all over now, come on.

1389
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,880
为什么你不直接杀了我
Why didn't you just kill me?

1390
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,550
因为死人反而会引起疑心
Because dead men get listened to,

1391
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,460
他的目的不是要杀你
he needed to do more than kill you.

1392
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,230
他必须摧毁你父亲所说的一切
He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father.

1393
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:30,120
而他的武器就在他脚下
And he had the means right at his feet.

1394
01:22:30,590 --> 01:22:33,240
化学雷区  地底下的压力垫
A chemical minefield, pressure pads in the ground,

1395
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:35,980
你每次回到这里  都会对你下药
dosing you up every time that you came back here.

1396
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:39,050
既是凶器也是犯案现场
Murder weapon and scene of the crime all at once.

1397
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,510
这个案子真是  太谢谢你了  亨利
This case, Henry. Thank you.

1398
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:45,650
- 简直太妙了  - 夏洛克  - 啥
- It's been brilliant! - Sherlock. - What?

1399
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,370
注意场合
Timing.

1400
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:52,800
- 不合适吗  - 不  没事
- Not good? - No, no, it's OK.

1401
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,780
没关系  因为这意味着
It's fine. Because this means...

1402
01:22:56,610 --> 01:23:00,850
这意味着我父亲说的没错
this means that my dad was right.

1403
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:03,010
他确实发现了秘密
He'd found something out, hadn't he?

1404
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:07,260
所以你杀了他  因为他说对了
And that's why you killed him, because he was right,

1405
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:13,510
他发现了你不可告人的试验
and he'd found you right in the middle of an experiment!

1406
01:23:21,110 --> 01:23:22,290
弗兰克兰
Frankland!

1407
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:27,180
弗兰克兰  接着跑
Frankland! Keep running.

1408
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,080
快点  跟上
Come on, keep up!

1409
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,980
没用的  弗兰克兰
It's no use, Frankland.

1410
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,480
谢谢  比尔
Thanks, Bill.

1411
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,240
- 这么说他们没杀死那条狗  - 显然
- So they didn't have it put down then, the dog? - Obviously.

1412
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,490
估计他们只是下不了手
I suppose they just couldn't bring themselves to do it.

1413
01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:49,860
懂了
I see.

1414
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,500
不  你不懂
No, you don't.

1415
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:56,140
- 好吧  我不懂  这算多愁善感吗  - 是的
- No, I don't. Sentiment? - Sentiment.

1416
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:00,690
那个  我在实验室里是怎么回事
Listen, what happened to me in the lab?

1417
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:03,680
你要加点沙司吗
Do you want some sauce with that?

1418
01:25:03,690 --> 01:25:05,410
我没去过山谷
I hadn't been to the Hollow.

1419
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,170
我怎么会听到那种声音
How come I heard those things there?

1420
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,610
你说的恐惧和刺激
Fear and stimulus, you said?

1421
01:25:08,610 --> 01:25:11,140
你肯定在别处被下药了  也许在实验室里
You must have been dosed with it elsewhere. In the lab, maybe?

1422
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,920
你看到那些管子了  年代久远  可能泄露了
You saw those pipes, pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.

1423
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:15,070
而那里面是有气体的
And they were carrying the gas,

1424
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:18,630
- 那  来点番茄酱吗  - 慢着
- so... Ketchup was it, or brown? - Hang on.

1425
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,170
你以为是在糖里
You thought it was in the sugar.

1426
01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:21,880
你当时确定是在糖里
You were convinced it was in the sugar.

1427
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:24,580
我最好快走了  火车还有一个半小时就开了
I'd better get going, there's a train leaving in half an hour,

1428
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:25,960
所以如果你想...
so if you want...

1429
01:25:26,060 --> 01:25:29,000
老天  是你
God! It was you.

1430
01:25:29,170 --> 01:25:31,810
你把我关在那该死的实验室里
You locked me in that bloody lab.

1431
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,580
- 我不得不这么做  那是个试验  - 试验
- I had to, it was an experiment. - An experiment?!

1432
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:37,090
我吓坏了  夏洛克  快吓死了
I was terrified, Sherlock, I was scared to death!

1433
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,830
我以为毒药在糖里  所以在你咖啡里放了糖
I thought the drug was in the sugar, so I put some in your coffee.

1434
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:42,180
接着我找巴里莫尔少校安排了一切
Then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.

1435
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,510
完全科学的实验控制环境  真心的
Totally scientific, laboratory conditions, literally.

1436
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,320
好吧  接着说  我这就来找你
All right, keep talking, I'll find you.

1437
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:56,310
接着说
Keep talking.

1438
01:25:56,310 --> 01:25:57,550
不行  它会听到我
I can't, it'll hear me.

1439
01:25:57,550 --> 01:25:59,100
说你看到什么了
Tell me what you're seeing.

1440
01:26:02,350 --> 01:26:04,810
我不知道  但我能听见它的声音
I don't know, but I can hear it now.

1441
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,030
我知道毒药对天才大脑的作用
I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind,

1442
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:09,220
所以我得在常人的大脑上试试
so I needed to try it on an average one.

1443
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,490
你知道我是什么意思
You know what I mean.

1444
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,280
但药不在糖里
But it wasn't in the sugar.

1445
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:18,560
我不知道你已经接触过气体了
No, well, i wasn't to know you'd already been exposed to the gas.

1446
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:20,420
- 所以你搞错了  - 没有
- So you got it wrong. - No.

1447
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:25,150
- 你就是错了  不在糖里  你弄错了  - 错了一点
- You were wrong. It wasn't in the sugar, you got it wrong. - A bit.

1448
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:27,710
不会再错了
It won't happen again.

1449
01:26:31,970 --> 01:26:33,440
有长期副作用吗
Any long- term effects?

1450
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:37,740
不会  你排泄掉了就没事了  我们都会这样
None at all. You'll be fine once you've excreted it. We all will.

1451
01:26:38,990 --> 01:26:40,920
那我想我已经搞定这个问题了
I think I might have taken care of that already.

1452
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:49,730
- 你去哪  - 马上回来
- Where are you going? - I won't be a minute.

1453
01:26:51,060 --> 01:26:52,920
去找个男人聊聊一条狗
Got to see a man about a dog.

1454
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:13,250
好吧  放他走
All right, let him go.

1455
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:23,250

1456
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1457
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1458
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1459
01:27:26,110 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1460
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1461
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:34,350
夏洛克

1462
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:33,000
夏洛克

1463
01:27:28,110 --> 01:27:33,000
夏洛克

1464
01:27:28,710 --> 01:27:33,850
夏洛克

1465
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:33,850
夏洛克

1466
01:27:29,710 --> 01:27:33,850
夏洛克

1467
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:34,000
夏洛克

1468
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:34,000
夏洛克

1469
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:34,000
夏洛克

1470
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,000
夏洛克
