1
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,533

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,360
Hey, do me a favor and take Table Seven.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,200
You mean the one with my 118-pound

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,950
rock-hard stud of a fiance

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,470
who's prone to canker sores and pinkeye?

6
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,130
Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,680
and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend,

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,770
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.

9
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,590
Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?

10
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,850
Oh, please-- you're not that kind of person.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,930
I know.

12
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,920
But if she orders something low-fat

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,660
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

14
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,590
Uh, that's my water.

15
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,340
What?

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,650
My water. You're drinking it.

17
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,450
D-Dear Lord!

18
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,380
Have you been drinking it?

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,290
Yes. It's my water.

20
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,720
Well, that's it then.

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,920
I'm dead.

22
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,480
Here we go...

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,390
I'm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you?

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,160
The backwash into this glass

25
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,480
is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home.

26
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,050
Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue

27
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,140
of your subtropical girlfriend.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,900
Hey! That's my sister

29
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,750
and my country you're talking about.

30
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,030
Leonard may have defiled one,

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,660
but I won't have you talking smack about the other.

32
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,690
You guys ready to order?

33
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,490
Yes, I'd like a seven-day course of penicillin,

34
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,840
some, uh, syrup of ipecac-- to induce vomiting.

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
and a mint.

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,780
I don't understand.

37
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,260
He drank from Leonard's glass.

38
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,610
"He drank from Leonard's glass"--

39
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,800
the words they'll be carving into my tombstone.

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,170
That's actually my napkin.

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,960
Oh, this is a nightmare!

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,030
- Where are you going? - To the bar,

43
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,640
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,570
Gang way! Dead man walking!

45
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,190
All right. Here you go.

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,810
Two lemonades,

47
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,500
one iced tea

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,770
and a root beer for Priya.

49
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,740
- Is it diet? - That's what you ordered.

50
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,640
Thank you.

51
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,660
Hey, have you and Howard

52
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,520
started planning your wedding yet?

53
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,430
Yeah. We're thinking of having it on a cliff

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,410
overlooking the ocean.

55
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,300
Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters

56
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,360
like the thought of falling and drowning.

57
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,100
What did your mother say

58
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,940
when you told her you were getting married?

59
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,060
He hasn't told her yet.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,270
He's waiting for the right time.

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,340
I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.

62
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,950
Howard, you've got to tell your mother.

63
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,290
Hey, have you told your parents you're dating

64
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:51,190
this short glass of skim milk here?

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,440
Uh... that's different.

66
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,290
First of all, we're not engaged;

67
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,970
and second, Indian parents

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,880
are very protective of their children.

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,810
Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,610
take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons.

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,420
I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.

72
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,690
- You all right? - Fine.

73
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,210
Thank you for asking.

74
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,190
I love you so much.

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,300
Fire demon.

76
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,410
Ooh, fire demon.

77
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,630
Sheldon's turning up the heat...

78
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,560
Troll master.

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,610
Check it! Howard pulls one out

80
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,040
from under the bridge. Nice!

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,540
Water nymph.

82
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,450
Oh, yeah, she's got puddles

83
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,390
in all the right places.

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,630
Could you please play the game

85
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,160
without commenting on every card?

86
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,000
Sorry.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,590
Walking tree.

88
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,220
Last one.

89
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,560
I'm taking a stroll and I'm sporting wood.

90
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,640
Okay, the Eagle has landed.

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,520
What's going on?

92
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,870
Bernadette and my mother are having

93
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,310
a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.

94
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,610
Oh, that sounds lovely.

95
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,470
Hope so.

96
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,770
Of course, if history is any indication,

97
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,900
my mother will swallow her whole

98
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,900
and spit out her bones like an owl.

99
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,950
Have you met Bernadette's parents?

100
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,640
You mean Adolf and Eva?

101
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,640

102
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:24,640
Not yet.

103
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,600
One goose step at a time.

104
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,610
Sheldon, that's my water.

105
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,590
Oh, dear Lord!

106
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,630
That's not your water.

107
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,770
I know.

108
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,080
Where's the mouthwash?!

109
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,720
"Where" indeed.

110
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,850
Ma, I'm home!

111
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,990
Where are you?

112
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm in the toilet!

113
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,400
So, how'd it go?!

114
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,780
Too soon to say!

115
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,580
I'm not done yet!

116
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,830
No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette!

117
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,110
I had a pastrami sandwich.

118
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,470
She had eggplant lasagna.

119
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,810
Like that's what a person orders in a Jewish deli.

120
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,460
Besides food, did you get along?

121
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,300
Did you talk?

122
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,820
Oh, sure! Did you know she's going to school

123
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,350
to become a microbiologist?!

124
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,080
No, she never mentioned it.

125
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,280
I bet she did and you didn't listen!

126
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,190
Yeah, that's probably it. So, what do you think?

127
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,390
Do you like her? She's great, huh?

128
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,110
She's a lovely girl!

129
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,760
Cute as a button!

130
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,980
That's good to hear, 'cause I've got some news.

131
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,620
I hope it's good news,

132
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,870
because I've got nothing but disappointment in here!

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,240
Bernadette and I are getting married.

134
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,880
Ma?

135
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,540
You too busy bearing down?

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
Ma?

137
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,390
Oh, my God, Ma? Ma? Ma?

138
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,190
Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down!

139
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,060
Son of a bitch! Ma, help!

140
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,970
Hello.

141
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,120
Haven't seen you in a while.

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,230
How's it going?

143
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,400
Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period

144
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,210
of the virulent organisms

145
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,970
trooping through my microvilli

146
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,970
into my circulatory system -- hunky-dory.

147
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,520
Did I say something amusing?

148
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,020
I don't know, maybe, I have no idea what you said.

149
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,060
So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy

150
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,930
with no semantic content at all?

151
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,480
My mirth. Classic.

152
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,960
Is there a station coming up

153
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,790
where I can board your giggling train of thought?

154
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,460
It's not a big deal, Sheldon.

155
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,190
It's just, ever since Leonard's been dating Raj's sister,

156
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,090
 I've had to keep my distance.

157
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,450
I don't get to hear all your jibber-jabber.

158
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,920
Jibber-jabber?!

159
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,380
I don't jibber-jabber.

160
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,070
What are you doing at work these days?

161
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,680
Oh, I'm working on time-dependent backgrounds

162
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,830
in string theory,

163
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,820
specifically quantum field theory

164
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,930
in "d-dimensional" de Sitter space.

165
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,950
Okay, come on, even you have to admit that's jibber-jabber.

166
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,710
Interesting, do you know

167
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:52,630
where the phrase "jibber-jabber" comes from?

168
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,510
Oh, my God, you're about to jibber-jabber

169
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,390
about jibber-jabber.

170
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,520
Howard and his mother are at the hospital.

171
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,220
- Come on, we gotta go.  - Oh, my God! What happened?

172
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,860
I don't know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry.

173
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,230
Okay.

174
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,890
Sheldon, let's go!

175
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,820
To a hospital?!

176
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,750
Full of sick people?!

177
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,250
Oh, I don't think so.

178
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,350
Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there,

179
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,190
we're going.

180
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,790
I can't.

181
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,900
Oh, don't tell me you're afraid of germs.

182
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,910
Not all germs.

183
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,750
Just the ones that will kill me.

184
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,920
It's the same way I'm not afraid of all steak knives --

185
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,440
just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax.

186
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
Fine, I'll tell Howard you didn't come

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,140
because you're more concerned

188
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,000
about your own well-being than his.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,660
I would think he would know that.

190
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,320
Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable.

191
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,270
You buy all these superhero T-shirts,

192
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,030
but when it's time for you

193
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,460
to step up and do the right thing,

194
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,840
you just hide in the laundry room.

195
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,830
Fine, I'll go.

196
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,570
Just for the record,

197
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,040
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.

198
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,110
She went in to visit my Uncle Roger,

199
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,560
caught something and bit the dust a week later.

200
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,070
The two of them now share a coffee can

201
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,840
on my mother's mantel.

202
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,210
So I knocked down the bathroom door,

203
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,580
picked up my poor unconscious mother,

204
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,400
carried her to the car,

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,210
and drove like a madman to the emergency room.

206
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
You're a real hero, Howard.

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,860
No, I did what any son would do.

208
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,580
Hang on a second -- you picked up your mother?

209
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,080
Her own legs are barely able to do that.

210
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,480
I was filled with adrenaline.

211
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,100
It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.

212
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,670
Yeah, I'm saying, it'd be easier to lift a car.

213
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,540
What can I tell you? After I found the courage

214
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,600
to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable.

215
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,960
So, how is she?

216
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,970
They're running tests-- I don't know.

217
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,740
It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.

218
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,710
What's the difference?

219
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,480
A heart-attack-like event

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,450
is an event that's like a heart attack.

221
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,190
Thanks for clearing that up.

222
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,230
Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable.

223
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,380
What's more likely going to kill Howard's mother

224
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,840
are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs

225
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,870
festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital.

226
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,490
Okay, you're not helping.

227
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,130
Disagree.

228
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,400
Go sit over there.

229
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll sit over there-- it looks cleaner.

230
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,830
Is there a history of heart disease in your family?

231
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,100
My family is the history of heart disease.

232
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,040
There's a cave painting in France

233
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,300
of one of my ancestors doing this:

234
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,190
So it's probably genetic.

235
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,550
Well, maybe.

236
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,530
Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her.

237
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,810
What?

238
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,370
It's not important.

239
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,840
Come on, Howard, I'm going to be your wife.

240
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,370
You can share anything with me.

241
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,590
You'd think that. But no.

242
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,360
You told her we were going to get married

243
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,160
and she had a heart attack?

244
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,930
You can't take that personally.

245
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,880
How else is she supposed to take it?

246
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,430
What you've got to keep in mind is that

247
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,290
ever since my dad left,

248
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,850
I've been the whole world to my mother.

249
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,700
I mean, she'd be threatened by any woman

250
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,450
who can give me what she can't.

251
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,420
You mean sexual intercourse?

252
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,190
Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy.

253
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,190
What happened?

254
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,750
Howard's mother had a heart attack

255
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,970
because I have sex with him and she can't.

256
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,230
Bernie, wait!

257
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,030
I'll give you $1,000 if you'll drive me home.

258
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,720
Nice of you to come for Howard.

259
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, he's my friend. It's what you do.

260
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,200
I'm sorry, did I miss something?

261
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,470
It's just so weird.

262
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,830
Howard Wolowitz is my friend.

263
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,330
You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat

264
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,420
and I broke his nose.

265
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:18,790
That's a little easier to believe than he's your friend.

266
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,450
Yeah, tell me about it.

267
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,100
You know, my brother had a group of friends like this in India.

268
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,940
They dressed up in leotards and goggles

269
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,870
and called themselves the New Delhi Power Rangers.

270
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,800
You mean when he was little.

271
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,570
Not as little as you'd want him to be.

272
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,330
You know, this stuff is horrible.

273
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,670
You want to see if we can find the cafeteria

274
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,840
- and get real coffee? - Sure.

275
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,640
We're going to the cafeteria to get some coffee.

276
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,720
You want anything?

277
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,140
I'm fine.

278
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,710
That's nice that they're getting along.

279
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,400
Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together?

280
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,250
Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you.

281
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,360
What are you talking about?

282
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,380
One of them broke up with you.

283
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you really want her telling the other one why?

284
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,620
I don't care.

285
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,130
I don't have anything to hide.

286
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,120
Good, good.

287
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,950
Then you have nothing to worry about.

288
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,440
No, I do not.

289
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,630
You are a mean little man.

290
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,400
You'd think it'd be because my parents didn't love me,

291
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,150
but actually they loved me a great deal.

292
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,780
Bernie, it's not you.

293
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,810
She's just set in her ways.

294
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,460
How can we be together if the thought of us

295
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,120
getting married might kill your mother?

296
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,870
It's the circle of life, sweetie.

297
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,220
One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you.

298
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,570
Howard, I have to go to the bathroom

299
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,100
and no one will take me home.

300
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,920
What's wrong with the bathroom here?

301
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,920
Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus

302
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,000
and other assorted coccuses.

303
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,860
Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed

304
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,570
and my fiance is grief-stricken over putting her there.

305
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,670
I'm not taking you home.

306
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,360
Will you at least go with me to the restroom here,

307
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,250
so you can open the door and flush the urinal?

308
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,580
No!

309
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,030
This might be a good time to point out, Howard,

310
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,700
that friendship requires a certain give and take.

311
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,140
Hold the door.

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,200
Mr. Wolowitz?

313
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,660
- Is she okay? - It wasn't a heart attack.

314
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,270
She's awake, she's resting comfortably--

315
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,750
we're still running tests.

316
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,820
Can I see her?

317
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,080
Actually, she said, and I quote,

318
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,520
she'd "like to see the little Catholic girl first."

319
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,290
Me? Why me?

320
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,160
Jews have been asking that for centuries.

321
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,300
There's no real good answer.

322
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:50,450
Okay, well, wish me luck.

323
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,960
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

324
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,560
Let's just hide Mr. Cross.

325
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,380
If it touches her, it burns.

326
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,210
- You brought a Catholic girl home to your mother? - Yeah.

327
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,210

328
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,210
Why don't I write you a prescription for Xanax.

329
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,730
Finally.

330
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,650

331
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,880

332
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,120
Oh, what fresh hell is this?

333
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,310
Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed.

334
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,510
No, I haven't.

335
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,510
It's all good.

336
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,300
You want to talk about crazy mothers,

337
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,890
Leonard's mom wouldn't give him any sort of approval growing up.

338
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,520
Oh, the poor thing.

339
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,540
It makes him desperate to please women.

340
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,820
That's why the foreplay goes on and on.

341
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,010
It does, doesn't it?

342
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,420
It's like he's trying to win a prize.

343
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,380
A word of advice-- don't doze off.

344
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,390
You will never hear the end of it.

345
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,500
Help me!

346
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,230
Come back!

347
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
Penny!

348
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,100
There are a couple of things I did with Penny

349
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,960
that might be a little silly, but...

350
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,140
Like what?

351
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,160
Every once in a while, before we'd go to bed,

352
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,650
I'd put on a little show for her.

353
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,460
What do you mean "a show"?

354
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,270
Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off.

355
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,300
Like, to music?

356
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,950
I'd look pretty stupid if there was no music.

357
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,560
So you'd do a striptease?

358
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,290
I wasn't swinging around a pole.

359
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,330
Good, good.

360
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:49,630
There was one time I put body glitter on.

361
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,740
Well, I don't think you have to worry

362
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,480
about Penny telling my sister that.

363
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,880
No, she wouldn't.

364
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,100
Your big problem is me telling her.

365
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,420
You really are a mean little man.

366
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,840
Oh, God, that's so true.

367
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,510
Yeah, I know, right?

368
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,850
Hey, what took you guys so long?

369
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,730
Oh, we were just chatting.

370
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,310
That's nice. What about?

371
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,470
We were just comparing notes

372
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,660
about how you are in the sack.

373
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,770
- That's funny. - Yeah.

374
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,340
What if she wasn't kidding?

375
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,660
It doesn't matter.

376
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,810
I'm the king of foreplay.

377
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,680
Hey, how'd it go?

378
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,650
You're a putz.

379
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,720
You know what that means?

380
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,750
Yeah. Do you?

381
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,670
Your mother just taught it to me.

382
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,780
She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli

383
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,860
and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.

384
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,940
And are you?

385
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,560
No, because I'm engaged to a putz.

386
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,830
You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack.

387
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,970
Well, based on the available evid--

388
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,530
Shut up!

389
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,490
She said I'm a wonderful girl

390
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,690
and that you're lucky to have me.

391
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,510
Where are you going?

392
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,630
To the toilet!

393
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,170
Is that okay with you?!

394
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,960
Is it just me,

395
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,050
or does she sound sexy when she's angry?

396
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
Mountain Elf.

397
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,770
He takes the elf from off the shelf.

398
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,390
Hell Hounds.

399
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,480
Hell Hounds-- who let the Satanic dogs out?

400
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,340
Who? Who-who?

401
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,410
Colossal Serpent.

402
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,970
I got a colossal serpent right here.

403
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,180
Must you?

404
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,540
Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up.

405
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,550
Rotting Zombie.

406
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,610
Sheldon's new Facebook photo.

407
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,500
Zandor, Wizard of the North.

408
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,220
Ha! I win.

409
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,180
If you skip the part about being

410
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,350
under a two-week quarantine

411
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,840
because you were exposed to a deadly disease,

412
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,390
absolutely.
