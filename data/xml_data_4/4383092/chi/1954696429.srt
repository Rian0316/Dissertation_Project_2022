没 但我确定自己得了葡萄球菌
No, but I'm pretty sure I picked up a staph infection.

他们真的是一毛不拔
So they literally gave me their two cents worth.

这太让人尴尬了
This is so embarrassing,

5
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:18,243
连钱上的林肯都不忍直视
even Abe Lincoln won't make eye contact.

00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:20,945
姑娘们 你们得帮我做件事
Girls, I need you to do something for me.

规矩你懂 你那里 你身上 你身边
You know the rule: nothing for you,

8
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:26,618

'Cause I'm not.

18

我可不敢玩火 还有惹长老教会的人
I don't mess with fire or Presbyterians.

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,748
着火了 着火了!

你觉得这地方被烧没了你会很开心吗
You'd think you want this place to burn to the ground.

25

You'd think that.

26

衣服沾上的韩式烧烤的味儿
You know you can never get the smell of Korean barbecue

30
00:01:25,744 --> 00:01:27,744
可是永远挥之不去的
out of your clothes.

31
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,323
他要么是在灭火
Either he put the fire out,

32
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:42,091
要么就是这小机器人高潮了

欢迎来到糕潮甜品吧
Welcome to The High dessert bar.

36
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:05,309
我是迎宾员兼准经理
I'm the hostess slash quasi-manager.

37
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,911
我第一天来就升职了
First day in, got a huge promosh.

38
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,013
我不想炫耀
I hate to brag,

39
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,214
但有人说我非常耀眼
but the word dezzaling was used.

40
00:02:13,083 --> 00:02:15,853
是啊 你自己说的
Yeah, by you.

41
00:02:15,854 --> 00:02:18,989
小小权利就让你冲昏了头
Little to no power has really gone to your head.

42
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,424
就是
It has.

43
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:24,027
她就像是糕点界的普京
She's like the Putin of pastry.

44
00:02:24,028 --> 00:02:25,429
不在餐馆打工的这种感觉
But doesn't it feel good

45
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,598
难道不好吗
to not just be working at the diner?

46
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,168
我一整天都没有踩到用过的婴儿尿布
I haven't slipped on one used baby diaper all day.

47
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:33,904
说到婴儿
Speaking of babies,

48
00:02:33,905 --> 00:02:36,565
看 Han来了
look, there's Han.

49
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,246
这已经是我第三次
That's, like, the third time

50
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,081
看到他在偷窥我们了
I caught him spying on us.

51
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:48,351
他干嘛要跟踪他最差的两个雇员啊?
Why would he stalk two of his worst employees?

52
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:49,452
就是啊
I know.

53
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:50,754
就像"沃利藏在哪了"这动画
It's like Where's Waldo

54
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,890
可是你都不想找到沃利啊
when you don't want to find Waldo.

55
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:57,027
怎么没有见到迎宾小姐
Not seeing a hostess up in here.

56
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,296
她想说的是准经理
She meant quasi-manager.

57
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:01,197
要是马丁·斯科塞斯走进来
If Marty Scorsese walks in here,

58
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:02,465
你想让他自己找地方坐吗?
do you want him to seat himself?

59
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,435
他会迷路的 迷路
He'll be lost. Lost.

60
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,671
不好意思 Joe 我只是在那边给Max..
Sorry, Joe, I was just over there giving Max...

61
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:09,672
亲爱的 我如果想要听故事的话
Honey, I'll download an audiobook

62
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,675
会自己去下载有声书刊的
if I want to hear a story.

63
00:03:12,676 --> 00:03:14,310
有个人我想介绍给你
I want you to meet someone.

64
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,713
我也想见 只要时机合适
Me too, and I'm sure I will when the time is right

65
00:03:16,714 --> 00:03:19,382
而且我愿意接纳别人
and I'm open to it.

66
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:21,184
现在还是专注于自己的事比较好
Kind of focusing on me right now.

67
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,286
停
Stop.

68
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,622
学会读懂表情
Learn to read faces.

69
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,090
我说的不是你
I'm not talking about you.

70
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,425
我是在说他
I'm talking about him.

71

Nashit是一个印度的名字
Nashit's an Indian name,

74
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,632
然后我听到的是爱尔兰口音吧?
and isn't that an Irish accent I detect?

75
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
或者是你一口大白牙
Or have I just lost consciousness

76
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,403
把我闪得人都傻了?
from how white your teeth are?

77
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:41,738
是的
Yes, it is.

78
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,973
我爸爸是印度人 我妈妈是爱尔兰人
My father's Indian. My mother's Irish.

79

他是爱尔兰人 还是印度人

80
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:46,809
他就是东方与西方的碰撞
He's East meets West.

81
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,144
他是一切
He's everything

82
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,981
热腾腾的爱尔兰咖啡 男孩乐队
in a hot Irish coffee, boy band package.

83

我在街上发现了他
I found him on the street

84
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,819
他就坐在一个脏乎乎的椅子旁边
next to a dirty chair.

101
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,633
嗯 你觉得你很好看对吧

110
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:07,955
我待会儿来做他这个服务员

111
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,698
给你 这不是你们的 对吧?
Here you go. This isn't yours, is it?

112
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,468
不是 因为他们已经吃过甜点了
No, because they already have dessert.

113
00:05:19,469 --> 00:05:21,703
妈的
Damn it.

114
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:24,005
你一个小时之前就要水了 对吧?

哦 别担心我们的嘴唇会干
Oh, don't you worry those lips.

117
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:33,014
漫漫人生 等一个小时候又何妨?
And what's an hour when we have our whole lives ahead of us?

118
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,116
Max 我不知道该怎么办了
Max, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

119

我这个服务员太差劲了
I stink as a waiter.

120
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,386
这真是太难受了
This is desperate.

121
00:05:38,387 --> 00:05:42,056
难受的时候需要亲热
Well, desperate times call for us making out.

122
00:05:43,058 --> 00:05:45,293
嘿 我有个问题问你
Hey, I have a question for you.

123
00:05:45,294 --> 00:05:47,362
你的皮肤如此光滑白皙
Your skin is so creamy and white.

124
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,064
你肯定有爱尔兰人血统吧
You must have a little Irish in you.

125
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:53,168
我体内有很多爱尔兰因子哦
I've had a lot of little Irishes in me.

126
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:55,236
这是挑逗的话吧?
That's meant to be dirty, right?

127
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:58,740
我只是想说我觉得你非常漂亮
Well, I just mean that I think you're quite beautiful.

128
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:03,077
好吧 我只是想说我们做定了
Oh, well, then I just mean we're doing it.

129
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,612
我以前觉得没人
I did not think there was somebody

130
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:06,948
有比我还漂亮的鼻子 或者做服务员
who had a prettier nose or was worse than me

131
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,083
比我还差 但你做到了
waiting tables, but here we are.

132
00:06:09,084 --> 00:06:11,986
Nashit 客人的甜点里没有叉子
Nashit, there's not a fork in the mix out there.

133
00:06:11,987 --> 00:06:15,256
现在 赶紧去叉那些女人
Now, get out there and fork those women.

134
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,391
别难为他
Take it easy on him.

135
00:06:16,392 --> 00:06:17,825
我可不想他为我服务的时候
I don't want him to be all forked out

136
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,128
都累坏了
by the time he gets to me.

137
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,797
我要和Nashit在床上大战三百回合
I'm gonna have so much sex on my bed with Nashit

138
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,966
以至于到换新床单的地步
that I'm gonna need a new sheet.

139
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,968
你这年纪对他来说有点大了吧?
Aren't you too old for him?

140
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,738
嗯 但测试说我心理年龄只有十四岁
Yeah, but that test said mentally I'm 14,

141
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:33,341
所以我们完全能做
so we can totally do it.

142
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,376
我要去唐人街找人
Well, I'm off to Chinatown to have someone

143
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,144
做针灸了
put needles in me.

144
00:06:37,145 --> 00:06:39,247
天啊 我大爱你的外套啊
Oh, my God. I love your coat.

145
00:06:39,248 --> 00:06:40,448
你看起来美极了
You look gorgeous.

146
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,650
我是说 外套如此飘逸
I mean, the way it flows.

147
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:45,920
好吧 我看出来你是个马屁精了
Okay, so I can see you're a kiss-ass,

148
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:46,954
是这样的
so here's the thing.

149
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,656
作为我的准经理
As my quasi-manager,

150
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:51,592
或者随便你跟别人说的什么
or whatever nonsense you're telling people,

151
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:54,762
我要你告诉Max和Nashit别兴奋
I need you to tell Max and Nashit to cool it.

152
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:56,797
"糕潮"的员工之间不能勾搭
There are no hookups here at The High.

153
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,966
没问题 要是咱们对经理任命意见一致
Done, and we can stop saying quasi

154
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,868
那个"准"字就可以免了
if we're both on board with the manager thing.

155
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,170
我没看好
We're not.

156
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:04,839
"糕潮"的招牌是精致糕点
The High is about fine pastry,

157
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,907
而不是你们的淫秽私生活
not someone's sordid love life.

158
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:09,210
但作为讽刺性的反转 要是我女朋来了
And in an ironic twist, I need you to kick

159
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,045
我要你把她从这里
my girlfriend's hot ass out of here

160
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:13,380
弄出去
if she comes in.

161
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:14,882
这是一百块
Here's $100.

162
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,016
一百块啊
That's $100.

163
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,719
赶她这事儿没商量
Consider her hot ass out the door.

164
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,387
我们吵架了
We're in a fight.

165
00:07:20,388 --> 00:07:22,222
她喝醉了 偷了我的黑卡
She got drunk, stole my Black Card,

166
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,192
在巴尼·格林格拉斯餐厅请了九十个人喝汤
and bought 90 people soup at Barney Greengrass,

167
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,328
关键是那里的汤根本不好喝
and the soup isn't even good there.

168
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,632
别误会我在拒绝你 因为我很需要钱
Do not take this as a no, because I want the money,

169
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,567
但你为什么不自己告诉她呢?
but why can't you just tell her yourself?

170
00:07:33,568 --> 00:07:34,935
我不能亲口跟她说
I can't tell her myself.

171
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,104
她比我年轻 大家都知道
She's younger than me, and everyone knows

172
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,905
妈妈式的女人可不性感
the mommy thing just isn't sexy.

173
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,778
保证她吃点东西 并且安全到家
Make sure she eats something and gets home safe.

174
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,316
Caroline 我有个问题问你
Caroline, I have a question for you.

175
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,451
我该怎么处理女人们给我的纸条啊?
What do I do with the notes the women give me?

176
00:07:51,452 --> 00:07:53,086
你收到纸条了?
You've gotten notes?

177
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,121
几张而已
Just a few.

178
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:59,259
女人们怎么这么饥渴?
How could women be this desperate?

179
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,528
Max 这张是你写的
Max, this one's from you.

180
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:03,763
几乎都是我写的
They're mostly all from me,

181
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,265
除了那张名片
except the business card.

182
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,633
我可不需要什么名片
I don't need no damn card

183
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,935
来告诉他我随时接客
to let him know I'm all business.

184
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:11,805
Max Joe刚跟我说"糕潮"店里不能勾搭
Max, Joe just told me there are no hookups at The High,

185
00:08:11,806 --> 00:08:14,808
而从你这细节生动的画来看
and judging from this very detailed picture you drew,

186
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,409
你一门心思只想勾搭啊
that's exactly what you're planning.

187
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,412
哦 我想的还多着呢 但是纸不够用了
Oh, I was planning more. I just ran out of paper.

188
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,947
我们不能丢了这份工作
We can't lose these jobs.

189
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:23,783
我有两张百元大钞 而且就差这么一点
I have two $100 bills, and I'm this close

190
00:08:23,784 --> 00:08:26,152
就能申请亚马逊金牌会员了
to pulling the trigger on an Amazon Prime account.

191
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,587
亚马逊金牌服务?
Amazon Prime?

192
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,888
你真是被权利冲昏头脑了
You have been driven mad with power.

193
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,978
新鲜的千层酥饼
Fresh, flakey pastry.

194
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,312
说起小薄饼
And speaking of flakes,

195
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:44,182
Joe的古怪女朋友在那边
there's Joe's flakey girlfriend.

196
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,819
谁帮我把椅子从外套上拿下来?
Can someone help me get my chair off my coat?

197
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,420
她怎么进来的?
How did she get in here?

198
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,657
估计是坐毒品云飘进来的
Probably floated in on a cloud of Valium.

199
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,793
该行动了 也就是她得离开
It's go time, as in she's got to go.

200
00:08:55,794 --> 00:08:58,396
你还不如去搬运失事列车呢
You have a better chance moving an actual train wreck,

201
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:59,864
但祝你好运
but good luck.

202
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:03,434
- Allie 嗨 你...  - 嘘
- Allie, hi, you...  - Shh.

203
00:09:03,435 --> 00:09:06,537
Allie 嗨
Allie, hi.

204
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,506
- 你得...  - 抱歉
- You need...  - Sorry.

205
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,608
但我还宿醉着呢 而且头疼
But I am hungover, and I have a headache.

206
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,344
能给我杯拿铁配大麻么?
Could I get a latte with a side of weed?

207
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,346
不行 因为这里不是阿姆斯特丹
No, because this isn't Amsterdam

208
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,415
或者比尔·马赫的家
or Bill Maher's house.

209
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,883
你得走了
Now, you need to leave.

210
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,418
你知道Joe不想你进来
You know Joe doesn't want you in here.

211
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:21,452
我不走
Well, I'm not leaving.

212
00:09:21,453 --> 00:09:22,787
我的腿动不了
My legs won't move

213
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,189
因为肌肉松弛剂刚开始起效
because my muscle relaxers just kicked in.

214
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,291
John 能帮我个忙吗?
John, can you do me a favor?

215
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,626
送Allie出去
Walk Allie outside,

216
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,294
也就是说 把她抬起来
and by that, I mean pick her up

217
00:09:30,295 --> 00:09:31,862
扛到外面去
and carry her outside.

218
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,898
我上的是糕点学校
I went to pastry school.

219
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,701
我不是怪物史莱克
I'm not Shrek.

220
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,504
当然不是 你更像维奥娜公主
Of course not. You're much more Fiona.

221
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,072
妹子 说得好
Girl, that's good.

222
00:09:42,073 --> 00:09:44,674
我本想说驴子的 因为我屁股很翘
I was gonna say the donkey, 'cause I have a fine ass.

223
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,347
啊哦 好吧
Okay, fine.

224
00:09:50,348 --> 00:09:54,784
司机 停两站 巴尼斯精品店和冰冻酸奶店
Driver, two stops. Barney's and Fro-Yo.

225
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,392
Earl 我们又迟到了 你帮我们照应着没？
Earl, we're late again. Did you keep us alive?

226
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,129
Max 我都自身难保了
Max, I can barely keep myself alive.

227
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,432
今天上午 我不得不把手指插到
This morning, I had to jump-start my heart

228
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,334
插座里给心脏起搏
by putting my finger in the socket

229
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,535
猫捉老鼠里的姿势
Tom and Jerry style.

230
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,572
哦 你好
Oh, hello.

231
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,507
姑娘们 你们今天做什么了?
So what did you girls do today?

232
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:21,078
自昨晚起 我就没见过你们了
I haven't seen you since right here last night.

233
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,613
哦 是吗 Han?
Oh, really, Han?

234
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,915
因为我发誓我看见你潜伏在
'Cause I swear I saw you lurking around

235
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,216
"糕潮"外面
outside The High.

236
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,417
要么是你
It was either you,

237
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,555
要么是皮卡丘造访纽约了
or Pikachu is visiting New York.

238
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,423
这话有点伤到我了
That one barely grazed me,

239
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,458
因为我是韩国人
because I'm Korean,

240
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,827
而皮卡丘是日本的
and Pikachu is Japanese.

241
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:40,796
你根本不了解"神奇宝贝"
You don't know anything about Pokemon.

242
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,367
Han 你也许不是日本人
Han, you may not be Japanese,

243
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,036
但我敢说你在未来
but in the future, you're definitely

244
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:49,406
肯定会被日本人日了
gonna be poked by a Mon.

245
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,041
而那个人就是你
And it was you.

246
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,409
不 不是
No, it was not.

247
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,777
- 是 就是  - 不是
- Yeah, it was.  - Wasn't.

248
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,011
- 是  - 不是
- Was.  - Wasn't.

249
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:57,547
- 不是  - 是... 不是
- Wasn't.  - Was... wasn't.

250
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,016
英语是我的第二语言
English is my second language.

251
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,718
承认吧 你是嫉妒
Admit it, you're jealous

252
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,953
我们把时间都花在另一间餐厅了
we're spending time with another restaurant.

253
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,555
我不是嫉妒
I am not jealous.

254
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,723
- 是  - 不是
- Are so.  - Am not.

255
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,091
- 不是  - 是... 不是
- Am not.  - Are so... not.

256
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,891
天啊!
Oh, my God!

257
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,731
Caroline 你在搞什么鬼?
Caroline, what the hell are you doing?

258
00:11:14,732 --> 00:11:16,699
我在闻一张百元纸币
I'm smelling a $100 bill.

259
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,334
这是从我的另一间餐厅拿的
It's from my other restaurant.

260
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,169
它能给我买很多好东西
It buys me nice things.

261
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,005
嫉妒吗?
Jealous?

262
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:25,240
我在你一无所有的时候 收留了你
I took you in when you had no one.

263
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,178
嗨 能帮我个忙吗?
Hi, can you help me?

264
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,980
我找Max
I'm looking for Max.

265
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,618
有事吗 你好 现在做基佬还来得及吗
Why, hello. Is it too late to be gay?

266
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,420
Nashit 你怎么来了?
Nashit?

267
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,622
天啊 他在太平间的灯光下
Oh, my God, he even looks good here

268
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,757
还是那么好看
in morgue light.

269
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,593
我们绝对要上床
We are so doing it.

270
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,795
Caroline 你把手机落在餐厅的
Caroline, you left your phone on the table

271
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,230
桌子上了
at the restaurant.

272
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,699
我承认 我以此为借口
I confess, I used it as an excuse

273
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,400
来见Max
to come and see Max.

274
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,602
这不是我的 这是Joe的女朋友的
This isn't mine. It's Joe's girlfriend's.

275
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:54,937
我没有"苹果6"
I don't have an iPhone 6.

276
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:57,205
我有"苹果"病
I have an iPhone sick.

277
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:03,978
来做吧
D-O-I-N-G it!

278
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,249
Max Nashit怎么会在这儿?
Max, why is Nashit here?

279
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,320
因为是上帝欠我的
Because God owes me.

280
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,756
你不能真的喜欢上他
You can't seriously be into him.

281
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,658
他看起来像是男孩乐队的成员
He looks like someone in a boy band.

282
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,661
是的 然后他就可以直插无误...
Yeah, and he's going one direction...

283
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,933
下面
Down there.

284
00:12:24,934 --> 00:12:26,702
但要是你跟他睡了
But if you sleep with him,

285
00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,071
Nashit会遇到麻烦的
then Nashit is gonna hit the fan.

286
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,307
你怎么知道你喜欢他?
How do you know you even like him?

287
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:35,276
你知道我喜欢什么吗? 就是我们在嘿咻
You know what I like? That we're doing it.

288
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,179
嘿 各位亲!
Hey, everybody!

289
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:41,316
我刚刚被一辆的士撞了
I just got hit by a cab,

290
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:46,321
不过我有兴致吃蟹腿呢
and, boy, am I in the mood for crab legs.

291
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,323
关于你的这件事 宝贝...
The thing about you, baby...

292
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:51,326
每个晚上的每次重击后
you bounce back from a good pounding

293
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,328
你都恢复得很快
every single night.

294
00:12:56,598 --> 00:13:00,669
等等
Wait a minute.

295
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,772
那是我的位置
That's my booth.

296
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,006
哦 很高兴见到你
Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

297
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,345
什么?
What?

298
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,815
那究竟是什么口音?
What the hell kind of accent is that?

299
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,750
我来自爱尔兰
I'm from Ireland.

300
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,318
什么?
What?

301
00:13:19,054 --> 00:13:20,622
Max 你不能做
Max, you are not doing it.

302
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:21,623
- 做  - 不做
- Are.  - Not.

303
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,924
- 做  - 不做
- Are.  - Not.

304
00:13:22,925 --> 00:13:25,927
- 不做  - 拜托 我是沃顿商学院出来的
- Not.  - Please, I went to Wharton.

305
00:13:25,928 --> 00:13:28,530
听着 我们做的时候 应该去你家
Look, we should go to your place when we do it

306
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:31,399
这样 Caroline就不会在我们做的过程中出现
so that Caroline won't be there while we're doing it.

307
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,503
很好 可我两天前才刚来美国
Lovely, but I just came to America two days ago.

308
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,205
我没地方可去
I have no place to go.

309
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,607
事实上 我一直睡在那张脏椅子上
In fact, I've been sleeping on that dirty chair

310
00:13:39,608 --> 00:13:42,977
Joe说过的那张
Joe spoke of.

311
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:46,915
什么?
What?

312
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,816
他在唱歌吗?
Is he singing?

313
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,520
天啊
Oh, my God.

314
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:55,056
他又迷人又无家可归?
He's gorgeous and homeless?

315
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,525
那就是你的梦中情人啊
That's your dream guy.

316
00:13:57,526 --> 00:13:59,926
我们绝对要嘿咻
We are so doing it!

317
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,769
呃 这不可能
Ugh, this is impossible.

318
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,172
我感觉自己穿上了珍藏版的奥斯卡礼服
I feel like I'm putting an Oscar dress on Precious.

319
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,612
我正在给Nashit铺沙发
I'm making up the couch for Nashit.

320
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,313
你真是太好了
That is so nice of you.

321
00:14:19,314 --> 00:14:21,315
在我们做爱后 他需要有个地方休息
He's gonna need a place to crash after we have sex.

322
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,151
不 我们不讨论这个
No, that's off the table.

323
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,319
我不敢相信 你邀请他留在这里
I can't believe you invited him to stay here.

324
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,954
我也不敢相信 你今晚
And I can't believe you refused

325
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:31,359
拒绝睡在星巴克 为我们腾出私人空间
to sleep at Starbucks tonight to give us some privacy.

326
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,062
你简直就是诺拉·琼斯
I mean, you like Nora Jones.

327
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,902
Max的菜
Max likey.

328
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:45,306
- Max 听着  - 不 你听着
- Max, listen.  - No, you listen.

329
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:50,644
我买不起糖 所以我只能舔他
I can't afford candy, so he has got to be it.

330
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:52,246
谢谢你的浴室
Thanks for the shower.

331
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:55,715
天啊 他的肌肉一直蔓延到他的鸡鸡
Oh, no, his muscles point to his penis.

332
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,310
Max 别再敲了
Max, stop with the banging.

333
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:12,014
我不会在你还"性"致勃勃时 让你出来的
I'm not letting you out while you're still in heat.

334
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:13,382
不是我
It's not me.

335
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:17,052
我正在想杀你的方法!
I'm making a list of ways to kill you!

336
00:15:18,654 --> 00:15:21,157
我感觉自己成了个麻烦
I feel like I'm being a bother,

337
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:25,094
而且感觉自己睡在烟斗上
and I think I'm sleeping on a bong.

338
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:27,496
开门
Open up.

339
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:29,198
我知道里面在做什么
I know what's going on in there.

340
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,466
天啊
Oh, my God.

341
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,168
是Joe
That's Joe.

342
00:15:32,169 --> 00:15:34,236
她一定已经发现 你和Max在约炮了
She must've found out about you and Max hooking up.

343
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,471
哦 不
Oh, no.

344
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,239
Max Joe在这里
Max, Joe is here.

345
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,574
你要像你以前那样
You need to do that thing you do

346
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,975
把走廊里的人吓跑
to scare people out of the hallway.

347
00:15:39,976 --> 00:15:41,310
怎么做 装看门狗
What do we think, guard dog

348
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,012
还是持着枪 但视力不好的
or little old lady with poor eyesight

349
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,246
老婆婆?
and loaded gun?

350
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:48,250
得 我走了
Fine, I'm going.

351
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:50,653
这就是我不肯离开曼哈顿的原因
This is why I never leave Manhattan.

352
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,788
嘿 你要进姑娘们的房间吗?
Hey, you need to get in the girls' apartment?

353
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:54,556
我有钥匙
I have a key.

354
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,625
我在大包里找找
Find it here in my big bag.

355
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,761
我知道它就在里面
I know it's in here somewhere.

356
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,430
我找到唇膏
Well, I got the lip balm.

357
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,500
还有... 看啊 我找到本圣经
I got... Oh, look, I got the Holy Bible.

358
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:06,033
还有...
I got...

359
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:11,140
看啊 这是直播电视的遥控机
Oh, look. Oh, the DirecTV remote.

360
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,109
天啊 我的雌性激素没了
Oh, my God, I'm losing estrogen.

361
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,695
Max 你和Nashit躲到你房间去
Max, you and Nashit go hide in your room,

362
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:19,064
但不准啪啪啪
but no sex.

363
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,465
你听她说了 不准啪啪啪
You heard her, no sex,

364
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,401
所以除此之外都要 我是说除此外的一切
so everything but, and I mean everything,

365
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,901
我是说都要
and I mean but.

366
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,905
找到了 它在...
Oh, here it is. It's right...

367
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:30,874
原来一直放在冷切肠下面啊
It was right under the cold cuts the whole time.

368
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:34,579
嗨Caroline
Caroline.

369
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,448
嗨 Joe
Hey. Hi, Joe.

370
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,052
哦!
Oh!

371
00:16:41,053 --> 00:16:42,687
耶
Yeah.

372
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,689
哈!
Ha!

373
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,361
原来你剪短发是因为这原因
Yeah, the shorter hair makes sense now.

374
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:50,895
好啊
Yeah.

375
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,965
不错嘛 Caroline
Good for you, Caroline.

376
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,568
我希望你会喜欢又臭又长的故事
I hope you like long, boring stories.

377
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,840
好了 Allie在哪? 我知道她在这
Okay, where's Allie? I know she's here.

378
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:04,075
我在她手机里装了个监视应用
I put a spy app on her phone,

379
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:08,046
虽然不光彩 但我是个嫉妒心很强的女人
and I'm not proud of it, but I'm a jealous woman.

380
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,049
她的手机啊 在我这
Oh, her phone. I have it.

381
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,585
她今天被我赶出去时 把它落在"糕潮"了
She left it at The High when I threw her ass out today

382
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,386
遵从你的指示哦
per your instructions.

383
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,821
我真不知道我为什么会
I don't know how I thought this thing

384
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:18,523
从一开始就认为我们会合适
was gonna work out to begin with.

385
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:19,924
我们在科切拉音乐节遇见的
We met at Coachella.

386
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:23,461
当时我们都迷上了一个性感的
We were both on Molly, this intensely hot

387
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:27,498
菲律宾女孩
Filipino girl.

388
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,734
- 嘘  - 我听见啪啪啪的声音
- Shh, shh.  - I'm hearing sexual sounds.

389
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:34,939
还有一丝偷偷摸摸的羞愧 是从卧室传来的
And hints of secret shame coming from the bedroom.

390
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,442
- Allie就在这  - 不 这没人
- Allie is here.  - No, no one's here.

391
00:17:37,443 --> 00:17:39,210
那只是我们的白噪声机
That's just our white noise machine.

392
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,545
我吓呆了 你都不是她的菜
I'm shocked. You're not even her type.

393
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:44,314
你的嘴唇像是用圆珠笔画的
Your lips are like two flair-pen marks.

394
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:53,224
真性感
That's hot.

395
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:55,760
不要开除Nashit!
Please don't fire Nashit!

396
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,629
戴苏斯博士的帽子是我的主意
The Dr. Seuss hats were my idea.

397
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,629
{\an8}戴苏斯博士 美国最受欢迎的儿童作家

398
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,134
{\an8}戴苏斯博士所著的书

399
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,134
我们在玩"在老爸身上跳来跳去"
We were playing Hop on Pop.

400
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,536
我是老爸
I was Pop.

401
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,571
我都不知道里面有个男的
I didn't even know there was a boy in there.

402
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:09,840
我只看见了你
I only saw you.

403
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,410
好吧 鉴于"糕潮"不允许员工谈恋爱
Okay, since there are no hookups at The High,

404
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:16,547
如果你不立刻跟他断交
if you don't stop sleeping with him immediately,

405
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,915
我的新经理...
my new manager...

406
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,385
Caroline就要把他那漂亮的屁屁
Caroline here is gonna have to kick

407
00:18:21,386 --> 00:18:23,487
赶回马路边去
his beautiful butt to the curb.

408
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:28,125
但人家还在做啊!
But I was mid-doing-it!

409
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:31,795
亲爱的 这里真的有股怪味
Honey, there's a real funky smell in here.

410
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,464
我得离开这
I got to get out of here.

411
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:37,401
另外 你就住这?
PS, this is where you live?

412
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,669
再收下这100刀吧
Take another $100.

413
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,144
Earl  嗨
Earl, hi.

414
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:48,712
Max现在的心情怎么样
What kind of mood is Max in?

415
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:50,280
不错啊
Pretty good.

416
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,983
按她的标准 就是没有醉
On the Max scale, she's below slightly drunk

417
00:18:52,984 --> 00:18:56,320
但是想把客人赶跑
but above punching a customer out.

418
00:18:56,321 --> 00:18:57,587
这就好
Oh, good.

419
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:58,955
我还担心她会对我发火
I was worried she'd be mad at me

420
00:18:58,956 --> 00:19:00,691
因为我迫不得已赶走了他的男宠
'cause I had to get rid of her boy toy.

421
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:03,126
Caroline 我要是想听你讲故事
Caroline, I'd put my hearing aids back in

422
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,861
就会把助听器戴上
if I wanted to hear a story.

423
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,032
猜猜我包里给你准备了什么
Guess what I have for you in my purse.

424
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:11,134
我上周问你要的卫生棉条?
The tampon I asked for last week?

425
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:13,470
不对 我还是要为那事道歉
No, and again, so sorry about that.

426
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,306
真的忘掉了
Really dropped that ball.

427
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,741
粘毛虫软糖
Gummy worms.

428
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:19,643
我确实赶走了你的甜心
Yes, I took away your man candy,

429
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:22,212
但我给你带了你爱的畅销糖果
but I got you these, the hot ones that you like

430
00:19:22,213 --> 00:19:24,748
就是那家有个打喷嚏的保安的高级糖果店
from the good candy store with the sneeze guards.

431
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:27,017
高级货
Fancy.

432
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,318
还有别担心Nashit
And don't worry about Nashit.

433
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:30,553
我给他找了份新工作
I got him another job.

434
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,389
毛毛虫!
Hot worm!

435
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,226
干净的酒杯来了
Clean glasses coming through.

436
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,594
挂着好看
Nice rack.

437
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:41,731
现在我知道为什么男人喜欢跟我说这个
Now I know why guys like saying that to me.

438
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:42,999
他在这
There he is!

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,135
新员工在这
There's the new employee.

440
00:19:45,136 --> 00:19:47,303
Han 我不敢相信你会因为Max求你
Han, I can't believe you would hire someone

441
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,172
而雇一个新员工
just 'cause Max asked you to.

442
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,474
这事跟你和Max没关系
This has nothing to do with Max or you.

443
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,076
这孩子跟我说了一句
The boy here said something to me

444
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:54,978
你俩永远理解不了的东西
that you two couldn't understand.

445
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,212
是什么 老板?
What's that, sir?

446
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:57,413
我是个勤劳肯干的员工?
That I was a hard worker?

447
00:19:57,414 --> 00:19:59,282
对! 就是这个
That's it! Yes!

448
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:00,750
天降甘露啊
Manna from heaven.

449
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,786
我居然招到个肯干活的员工
I actually have an employee who works.

450
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,287
嫉妒吗?
Jealous?

451
00:20:06,522 --> 00:20:08,257
这个活 我干得了
Now, this job, I can do.

452
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,359
我从小到大 有5个兄弟姐妹
You know, growing up, I had five brothers and sisters,

453
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,195
因为我长得最难看
and since I was the least attractive,

454
00:20:12,196 --> 00:20:14,363
全部的盘子都得我洗
I had to clean all the dishes.

455
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,365
洗盘室见 Nashit
Meet you in the dish room, Nashit.

456
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,800
Max 你在干嘛
Max, what are you doing?

457
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,902
也许"糕潮"不允许员工勾搭
There may not be hookups at The High,

458
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:23,105
但是在这低谷可以尽情放纵
but there are hookups here at our lowest low,

459
00:20:23,106 --> 00:20:24,873
还有我们就是要做
and we are doing it.

460
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:30,445
Caroline的最爱
