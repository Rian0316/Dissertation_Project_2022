Max, did you pick up
the tip from table two?

No, but I'm pretty sure
I picked up a staph infection.

3
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:13,003
So they literally gave me
their two cents worth.

A fire?

14
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:44,100
No, a way out of this job.

15
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:48,439
Lord Jesus, there's a fire.

16

You'd think you want this
place to burn to the ground.

Welcome to The High dessert bar.

40
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:05,308
I'm the hostess slash quasi-manager.

41
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,911
First day in, got a huge promosh.

42
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:09,013
I hate to brag,

43
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,213

I'm Nashit.

Nashit's an Indian name,

78
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,632
and isn't that an Irish accent I detect?

79
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
Or have I just lost consciousness

Here you go. This isn't yours, is it?

117
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:19,468
No, because they already have dessert.

Well, I just mean that I think
you're quite beautiful.

Oh, well, then I just
mean we're doing it.

Now, get out there and fork those women.

140
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:17,824
I don't want him to be all forked out

141
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,127

142
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,797
I'm gonna have so much sex
on my bed with Nashit

143
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,966
that I'm gonna need a new sheet.

144
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:26,968
Aren't you too old for him?

145
00:06:26,968 --> 00:06:30,737
Yeah, but that test said mentally I'm 14,

146
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,341
so we can totally do it.

147
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:35,375
Well, I'm off to Chinatown
to have someone

148
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,144
put needles in me.

149

Okay, so I can see you're a kiss-ass,

153
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,954
so here's the thing.

154
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,656
As my quasi-manager,

155
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:51,591
or whatever nonsense
you're telling people,

156
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:54,762
I need you to tell Max
and Nashit to cool it.

157
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,797
There are no hookups here at The High.

158
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:58,966
Done, and we can stop staying “quas”"

159
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,867
if we're both on board
with the manager thing.

160
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:03,170
We're not.

161
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,838
The High is about fine pastry,

162
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:06,906
not someone's sordid love life.

163
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:09,209
And in an ironic twist,
I need you to kick

164
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,045
my girlfriend's hot ass out of here

165
00:07:11,045 --> 00:07:13,379
if she comes in.

166
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,882
Here's $100.

167
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:16,016
That's $100.

168
00:07:16,016 --> 00:07:18,718
Consider her hot ass out the door.

169
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,387
We're in a fight.

170
00:07:20,387 --> 00:07:22,221
She got drunk, stole my Black Card,

171
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:25,192
and bought 90 people soup
at Barney Greengrass,

172
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:28,327
and the soup isn't even good there.

173
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,632
Do not take this as a no,
because I want the money,

174
00:07:31,632 --> 00:07:33,567
but why can't you
just tell her yourself?

175
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,935
I can't tell her myself.

176
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,103
She's younger than me,
and everyone knows

177
00:07:37,105 --> 00:07:39,904
the mommy thing just isn't sexy.

178
00:07:42,776 --> 00:07:45,778
Make sure she eats something
and gets home safe.

179
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,316
Caroline, I have a question for you.

180
00:07:49,317 --> 00:07:51,451
What do I do with the
notes the women give me?

181
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,086
You've gotten notes?

182
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,120
Just a few.

183
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:56,389
[gasps]

184
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:59,259
How could women be this desperate?

185
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,528
Max, this one's from you.

186
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,762
They're mostly all from me,

187
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,264
except the business card.

188
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,632
I don't need no damn card

189
00:08:06,634 --> 00:08:08,935
to let him know I'm all business.

190
00:08:08,935 --> 00:08:11,805
Max, Joe just told me there
are no hookups at The High,

191
00:08:11,805 --> 00:08:14,807
and judging from this very
detailed picture you drew,

192
00:08:14,809 --> 00:08:16,408
that's exactly what you're planning.

193
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,411
Oh, I was planning more.
I just ran out of paper.

194
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,947
We can't lose these jobs.

195
00:08:20,947 --> 00:08:23,783
I have two $100 bills,
and I'm this close

196
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:26,151
to pulling the trigger on
an Amazon Prime account.

197
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:27,586
Amazon Prime?

198
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:29,887
You have been driven mad with power.

199
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,977
Fresh, flakey pastry.

200
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:41,312
And speaking of flakes,

201
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,182
there's Joe's flakey girlfriend.

202
00:08:44,182 --> 00:08:47,818
Can someone help me get
my chair off my coat?

203
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,419
How did she get in here?

204
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,657
Probably floated in
on a cloud of Valium.

205
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,793
It's go time, as in she's got to go.

206
00:08:55,793 --> 00:08:58,395
You have a better chance
moving an actual train wreck,

207
00:08:58,397 --> 00:08:59,864
but good luck.

208
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:03,433
- Allie, hi, you...
- Shh.

209
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:06,537
[whispering] Allie, hi.

210
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:08,505
- You need...
- Sorry.

211
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,607
But I am hungover, and
I have a headache.

212
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,344
Could I get a latte with a side of weed?

213
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:15,346
No, because this isn't Amsterdam

214
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,414
or Bill Maher's house.

215
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,883
Now, you need to leave.

216
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,418
You know Joe doesn't want you in here.

217
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,451
Well, I'm not leaving.

218
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:22,787
My legs won't move

219
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,188
because my muscle
relaxers just kicked in.

220
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,291
John, can you do me a favor?

221
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,625
Walk Allie outside,

222
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:30,293
and by that, I mean pick her up

223
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:31,861
and carry her outside.

224
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,898
I went to pastry school.

225
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,701
I'm not Shrek.

226
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,504
Of course not. You're much more Fiona.

227
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,072
Girl, that's good.

228
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,673
I was gonna say the donkey,
'cause I have a fine ass.

229
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,346
(Allie) Okay, fine.

230
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:54,783
Driver, two stops. Barney's and Fro-Yo.

231
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,392
(Max) Earl, we're late again.
Did you keep us alive?

232
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:06,129
Max, I can barely keep myself alive.

233
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:08,432
This morning, I had to
jump-start my heart

234
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,333
by putting my finger in the socket

235
00:10:10,335 --> 00:10:12,534
<i>Tom and Jerry</i> style.

236
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,572
Oh, hello.

237
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:17,506
So what did you girls do today?

238
00:10:17,508 --> 00:10:21,077
I haven't seen you since
right here last night.

239
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,613
Oh, really, Han?

240
00:10:22,614 --> 00:10:24,914
'Cause I swear I saw you lurking around

241
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,216
outside The High.

242
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,417
It was either you,

243
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:31,554
or Pikachu is visiting New York.

244
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,423
That one barely grazed me,

245
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,457
because I'm Korean,

246
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,826
and Pikachu is Japanese.

247
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:40,796
You don't know anything about Pokemon.

248
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:44,366
Han, you may not be Japanese,

249
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:46,036
but in the future, you're definitely

250
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:49,405
gonna be poked by a Mon.

251
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:51,040
And it was you.

252
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:52,408
No, it was not.

253
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:53,777
- Yeah, it was.
- Wasn't.

254
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,010
- Was.
- Wasn't.

255
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:57,547
- Wasn't.
- Was... wasn't.

256
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,015
English is my second language.

257
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,717
Admit it, you're jealous

258
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,952
we're spending time
with another restaurant.

259
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:05,554
I am not jealous.

260
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,722
- Are so.
- Am not.

261
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:08,091
- Am not.
- Are so... not.

262
00:11:08,091 --> 00:11:09,890
Oh, my God!

263
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:14,730
Caroline, what the hell are you doing?

264
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:16,698
I'm smelling a $100 bill.

265
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,333
It's from my other restaurant.

266
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,168
It buys me nice things.

267
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:22,004
Jealous?

268
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:25,240
I took you in when you had no one.

269
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:29,177
Hi, can you help me?

270
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:30,980
I'm looking for Max.

271
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,618
Why, hello. Is it too late to be gay?

272
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:37,419
Nashit?

273
00:11:37,421 --> 00:11:39,621
Oh, my God, he even looks good here

274
00:11:39,623 --> 00:11:41,756
in morgue light.

275
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,592
We are so doing it.

276
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,794
Caroline, you left your
phone on the table

277
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:47,230
at the restaurant.

278
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,698
I confess, I used it as an excuse

279
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,399
to come and see Max.

280
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,601
This isn't mine. It's
Joe's girlfriend's.

281
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:54,937
I don't have an iPhone 6.

282
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:57,205
I have an iPhone sick.

283
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,977
D-O-I-N-G it!

284
00:12:05,246 --> 00:12:07,249
Max, why is Nashit here?

285
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,320
Because God owes me.

286
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,755
You can't seriously be into him.

287
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:15,658
He looks like someone in a boy band.

288
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:19,661
Yeah, and he's going one direction...

289
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,932
Down there.

290
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:26,701
But if you sleep with him,

291
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:29,071
then Nashit is gonna hit the fan.

292
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,307
How do you know you even like him?

293
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:35,275
You know what I like?
That we're doing it.

294
00:12:36,378 --> 00:12:38,178
Hey, everybody!

295
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:41,316
I just got hit by a cab,

296
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:46,321
and, boy, am I in the
mood for crab legs.

297
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:48,322
The thing about you, baby...

298
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:51,326
you bounce back from a good pounding

299
00:12:51,326 --> 00:12:54,327
every single night.

300
00:12:56,597 --> 00:13:00,668
Wait a minute.

301
00:13:00,669 --> 00:13:03,772
That's my booth.

302
00:13:03,773 --> 00:13:06,005
Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

303
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:10,345
What?

304
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:13,815
What the hell kind of accent is that?

305
00:13:13,816 --> 00:13:15,750
I'm from Ireland.

306
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,317
What?

307
00:13:19,053 --> 00:13:20,621
Max, you are not doing it.

308
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:21,623
- Are.
- Not.

309
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,923
- Are.
- Not.

310
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:25,927
- Not.
- Please, I went to Wharton.

311
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:28,529
Look, we should go to
your place when we do it

312
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,399
so that Caroline won't be
there while we're doing it.

313
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,503
Lovely, but I just came
to America two days ago.

314
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:37,205
I have no place to go.

315
00:13:37,206 --> 00:13:39,606
In fact, I've been sleeping
on that dirty chair

316
00:13:39,607 --> 00:13:42,976
Joe spoke of.

317
00:13:42,977 --> 00:13:46,914
What?

318
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:49,816
Is he singing?

319
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:52,519
Oh, my God.

320
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,056
He's gorgeous and homeless?

321
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,524
That's your dream guy.

322
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,926
We are so doing it!

323
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:07,769
Ugh, this is impossible.

324
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,172
I feel like I'm putting an
Oscar dress on Precious.

325
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,611
I'm making up the couch for Nashit.

326
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,312
That is so nice of you.

327
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:21,315
He's gonna need a place
to crash after we have sex.

328
00:14:21,316 --> 00:14:23,150
No, that's off the table.

329
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,318
I can't believe you
invited him to stay here.

330
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,953
And I can't believe you refused

331
00:14:26,955 --> 00:14:31,359
to sleep at Starbucks tonight
to give us some privacy.

332
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,062
I mean, you like Nora Jones.

333
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:38,364
[whistling]

334
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:41,902
Max likey.

335
00:14:41,903 --> 00:14:45,306
- Max, listen.
- No, you listen.

336
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:50,644
I can't afford candy,
so he has got to be it.

337
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:52,245
Thanks for the shower.

338
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:55,715
Oh, no, his muscles point to his penis.

339
00:15:03,072 --> 00:15:05,374
[knock at door]

340
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,309
Max, stop with the banging.

341
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:12,014
I'm not letting you out
while you're still in heat.

342
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,381
(Max) It's not me.

343
00:15:13,383 --> 00:15:17,052
I'm making a list of ways to kill you!

344
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:21,157
I feel like I'm being a bother,

345
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:25,094
and I think I'm sleeping on a bong.

346
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,195
[knock at door]

347
00:15:26,196 --> 00:15:27,495
(Joe) Open up.

348
00:15:27,496 --> 00:15:29,197
I know what's going on in there.

349
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:30,466
(Caroline) Oh, my God.

350
00:15:30,466 --> 00:15:32,168
That's Joe.

351
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:34,235
She must've found out about
you and Max hooking up.

352
00:15:34,236 --> 00:15:35,471
(Nashit) Oh, no.

353
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:37,239
Max, Joe is here.

354
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,573
You need to do that thing you do

355
00:15:38,575 --> 00:15:39,975
to scare people out of the hallway.

356
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,309
What do we think, guard dog

357
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,011
or little old lady with poor eyesight

358
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:44,245
and loaded gun?

359
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:46,981
[Max imitating dog barking]

360
00:15:46,982 --> 00:15:48,250
Fine, I'm going.

361
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,653
This is why I never leave Manhattan.

362
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,788
Hey, you need to get
in the girls' apartment?

363
00:15:52,788 --> 00:15:54,556
I have a key.

364
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,625
Find it here in my big bag.

365
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,760
I know it's in here somewhere.

366
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,429
Well, I got the lip balm.

367
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,500
I got... Oh, look, I got the Holy Bible.

368
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,033
I got...

369
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:11,139
Oh, look. Oh, the DirecTV remote.

370
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,109
Oh, my God, I'm losing estrogen.

371
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,695
Max, you and Nashit
go hide in your room,

372
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:19,063
but no sex.

373
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,465
You heard her, no sex,

374
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:22,400
so everything but,
and I mean everything,

375
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,900
and I mean but.

376
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:26,904
Oh, here it is. It's right...

377
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:30,874
It was right under the
cold cuts the whole time.

378
00:16:33,077 --> 00:16:34,578
(Joe) Caroline.

379
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,447
Hey. Hi, Joe.

380
00:16:36,448 --> 00:16:41,052
Oh!

381
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:42,687
Yeah.

382
00:16:42,687 --> 00:16:44,688
Ha!

383
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,360
Yeah, the shorter hair makes sense now.

384
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:50,894
(Sophie) Yeah.

385
00:16:50,895 --> 00:16:53,965
Good for you, Caroline.

386
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,567
I hope you like long, boring stories.

387
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,840
Okay, where's Allie? I know she's here.

388
00:17:01,841 --> 00:17:04,075
I put a spy app on her phone,

389
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:08,046
and I'm not proud of it,
but I'm a jealous woman.

390
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:11,048
Oh, her phone. I have it.

391
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:13,585
She left it at The High when
I threw her ass out today

392
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,385
per your instructions.

393
00:17:15,386 --> 00:17:16,820
I don't know how I thought this thing

394
00:17:16,821 --> 00:17:18,522
was gonna work out to begin with.

395
00:17:18,523 --> 00:17:19,923
We met at Coachella.

396
00:17:19,924 --> 00:17:23,461
We were both on Molly,
this intensely hot

397
00:17:23,461 --> 00:17:27,498
Filipino girl.

398
00:17:27,499 --> 00:17:29,733
- Shh, shh.
- I'm hearing sexual sounds.

399
00:17:29,734 --> 00:17:34,939
And hints of secret shame
coming from the bedroom.

400
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,442
- Allie is here.
- No, no one's here.

401
00:17:37,442 --> 00:17:39,210
That's just our white noise machine.

402
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:41,545
I'm shocked. You're not even her type.

403
00:17:41,546 --> 00:17:44,314
Your lips are like two flair-pen marks.

404
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:49,487
[Nashit laughs]

405
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:53,223
That's hot.

406
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,759
Please don't fire Nashit!

407
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,628
The Dr. Seuss hats were my idea.

408
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,134
We were playing <i>Hop on Pop.</i>

409
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,536
I was Pop.

410
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:07,570
I didn't even know
there was a boy in there.

411
00:18:07,571 --> 00:18:09,839
I only saw you.

412
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,410
Okay, since there are
no hookups at The High,

413
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:16,547
if you don't stop sleeping
with him immediately,

414
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:17,914
my new manager...

415
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,148
[clicks tongue]

416
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,384
Caroline here is gonna have to kick

417
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,487
his beautiful butt to the curb.

418
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:28,125
But I was mid-doing-it!

419
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:31,795
Honey, there's a real
funky smell in here.

420
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,463
I got to get out of here.

421
00:18:33,464 --> 00:18:37,401
PS, this is where you live?

422
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,669
Take another $100.

423
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,144
Earl, hi.

424
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:48,711
What kind of mood is Max in?

425
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,279
Pretty good.

426
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,982
On the Max scale, she's
below slightly drunk

427
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:56,319
but above punching a customer out.

428
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,586
Oh, good.

429
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:58,954
I was worried she'd be mad at me

430
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:00,691
'cause I had to get rid of her boy toy.

431
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:03,125
Caroline, I'd put my
hearing aids back in

432
00:19:03,126 --> 00:19:05,861
if I wanted to hear a story.

433
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:09,031
Guess what I have for you in my purse.

434
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:11,134
The tampon I asked for last week?

435
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,470
No, and again, so sorry about that.

436
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,306
Really dropped that ball.

437
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:17,740
Gummy worms.

438
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,643
Yes, I took away your man candy,

439
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:22,211
but I got you these, the
hot ones that you like

440
00:19:22,212 --> 00:19:24,748
from the good candy store
with the sneeze guards.

441
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:25,714
[gasps]

442
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:27,017
Fancy.

443
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:28,317
And don't worry about Nashit.

444
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,553
I got him another job.

445
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,388
Hot worm!

446
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,226
Clean glasses coming through.

447
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:37,594
Nice rack.

448
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:41,730
Now I know why guys
like saying that to me.

449
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:42,999
There he is!

450
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,134
There's the new employee.

451
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:47,302
(Caroline) Han, I can't believe
you would hire someone

452
00:19:47,304 --> 00:19:49,172
just 'cause Max asked you to.

453
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:51,473
This has nothing to do with Max or you.

454
00:19:51,474 --> 00:19:53,076
The boy here said something to me

455
00:19:53,076 --> 00:19:54,978
that you two couldn't understand.

456
00:19:54,979 --> 00:19:56,211
What's that, sir?

457
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,413
That I was a hard worker?

458
00:19:57,413 --> 00:19:59,281
That's it! Yes!

459
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,750
Manna from heaven.

460
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,786
I actually have an employee who works.

461
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,287
Jealous?

462
00:20:06,521 --> 00:20:08,257
Now, this job, I can do.

463
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:10,358
You know, growing up, I had
five brothers and sisters,

464
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:12,194
and since I was the least attractive,

465
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:14,363
I had to clean all the dishes.

466
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:16,365
Meet you in the dish room, Nashit.

467
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,799
Max, what are you doing?

468
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,902
There may not be hookups at The High,

469
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:23,105
but there are hookups
here at our lowest low,

470
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,873
and we are doing it.

471
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:30,444
Caroline likey.

472
