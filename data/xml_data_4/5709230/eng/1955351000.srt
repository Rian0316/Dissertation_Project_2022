00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
With me, it's...

177
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,160
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

178
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,680
I was waiting for a prostitute.

179
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,120
Escort, hooker,
whatever they call them now.

180
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,400
I got a family, which is great.

181
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,040
You get bored.

182
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,360
I mean, when I was young,
I used to like...

183
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,320
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

184
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,360
For old times' sake, I don't know.

185
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,080
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

186
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,400
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

187
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,520
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

188
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,680
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

189
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,280
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

190
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,920
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

191
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,400
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

192
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Sucked up the whole hard drive
like an audit.

193
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,640
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

194
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,800
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

195
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,720
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

196
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,920
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

197
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Custody, she'd win.

198
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,280
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

199
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,880
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

200
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,240
[sobs]

201
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,280
They filmed me.

202
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,760
- Filmed you...
- Through my computer camera.

203
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,160
- What, like, filmed you?
- Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

204
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,560
- Like sex?
- No. Like, you... you know.

205
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,560
Jerking off.
Jerking off to porn or something?

206
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
Well, everyone does that.

207
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,640
- The fucking pope probably does that.
- They're gonna put it everywhere.

208
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,400
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

209
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,280
- Oh, shit the fuck!
- What? What?

210
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,080
- How long's that light been on?
- What light?

211
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,440
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

212
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I won't be a minute.

213
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,840
Unleaded. Unleaded.

214
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Oh, bugger!

215
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

216
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,960
Have you got any money?

217
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,240
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

218
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,280
- Visa card...
- Just the number!

219
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,680
- Uh... 3109.
- Okay, go!

220
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,880
[man] Pump four!

221
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
[chattering]

222
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
- What's your pump number?
- Four.

223
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,920
- You want some chocolate?
- No.

224
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
- It's two for one this week.
- I'm okay.

225
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
31.89.

226
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,440
Pop your PIN in.

227
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,280
[machine beeps]

228
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,360
[beeps]

229
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,400
- [woman] If you're sure you don't mind?
- [man] No, no, of course not.

230
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,120
- I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
- Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

231
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,200
- Okay.
- Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

232
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,280
Okay.

233
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,920
This is, uh...

234
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,640
my nephew.

235
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,160
Nice to meet you.

236
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
- Kenny.
- Kenny. I'm Karen.

237
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,840
We're both Ks. [laughs]

238
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,880
I'm head of the PTA at Theo
and Cassie's school, for my sins.

239
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,360
Just roped poor Hector into sorting out
the catering for the quiz night.

240
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,000
Been the usual balls up.

241
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,200
Listen, we better get this guy
to the station.

242
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,840
His train's... So we better go.

243
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,640
- Cansroad Station?
- Yeah.

244
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,840
Oh, couldn't drop me
at the end of my road, could you?

245
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,320
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

246
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,800
It's the bus otherwise and that goes
all the way around the common.

247
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,200
- We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
- Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

248
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,040
I'll hop out.
Hardly need to slow down. Yeah?

249
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,000
- Yep. Sure. Let's go.
- Brilliant. Thanks!

250
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,720
I'll just get in the back.

251
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,560
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

252
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,560
- What's that? Present?
- It's a cake.

253
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,440
- It's just a... it's a cake for Penny.
- Oh, lucky her.

254
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,520
So how is Penny?

255
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,760
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

256
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,120
She's good.

257
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,400
- She still planning to get back to work?
- Yeah. Yep.

258
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,840
[phone chimes]

259
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,200
- [Karen] I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

260
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,960
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

261
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,720
Yeah, he had a good time.

262
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,120
[Karen gasps]
Oh, Anna's having a sleepover.

263
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,560
Cassie's probably already told you
about it.

264
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,440
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad! [laughs]

265
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,800
[phone chimes]

266
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,400
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

267
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,480
- Sorry. What?
- Are you going home or...?

268
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,160
- Uh...
- Train. Birmingham.

269
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
Yeah. Uh...

270
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,360
- Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
- Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

271
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,960
- What part are you?
- South.

272
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,600
[Karen] South.

273
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,240
- Mainly.
- Right.

274
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,400
[chiming]

275
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,080
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound...

276
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that...

277
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
that... I don't have the accent.

278
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,680
- [phone chimes]
- [horn alert plays]

279
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,120
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

280
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
- [phone chimes]
- Like London. I grew up in London.

281
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
[Karen] Okay.

282
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,240
And is your mum and dad
on Hector's side or Penny's?

283
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,960
[revs engine]

284
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,400
[tyres screeching]

285
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,640
Someone crossing! Crossing!

286
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,680
[tyres screech]

287
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,840
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

288
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,680
- [tyres screeching]
- [horn honking]

289
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,480
- This is me.
- [tyres screech]

290
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,400
[Karen sighs, mutters]

291
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

292
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,960
- Yes, of course.
- Bye, then.

293
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,600
- Bye, Karen.
- Bye.

294
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,120
[horn blares]

295
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,000
We're gonna make it, okay?

296
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,720
It's this junction.

297
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,480
- What? This one?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
[stops engine]

299
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,040
You sure this is it?

300
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,360
- [horn alert plays]
- [phone pings]

301
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,320
"Look in the cake."

302
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,000
Let's look in the cake.

303
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,560
Look in the cake.

304
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,440
In the cake, I suppose.

305
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,760
I got something.

306
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
What the fuck?

307
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,600
[Kenny] Oh, my God.

308
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
[phone chimes]

309
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,320
"Five minutes to decide."

310
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,160
- Decide what?
- [horn alert plays]

311
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,280
[phone chimes]

312
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,560
- "Who is driver?"
- "Who is robber?"

313
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,680
Oh, no. No.

314
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,600
- W-w-we can't. We...
- I'm driver.

315
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,960
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

316
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,760
I'll be right here
with the engine running.

317
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
We... We can't. We...

318
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,680
Then how else are we gonna deal
with this, Kenny?

319
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,160
- I'm not...
- Listen to me.

320
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,280
- I'm not...
- Shut up and listen!

321
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,800
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

322
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,320
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

323
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:25,040
Shut up! Point two,
in a robbery, staff are trained.

324
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
I am not...

325
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,760
They are trained to hand over the cash.

326
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,520
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

327
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,680
It's not easy.

328
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,760
I know it isn't easy, but what the fuck
else are we gonna do? Hey?

329
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,680
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

330
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,480
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

331
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,600
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

332
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:54,400
- I only looked at pictures and...
- And beat one off on camera?

333
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,080
That's what they got, yeah?

334
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,080
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

335
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,120
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

336
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,720
And her friends.
All eyes on you, giving it that.

337
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,040
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

338
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,920
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

339
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,840
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

340
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,680
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

341
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,160
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

342
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,280
It'd be glued to your name,
