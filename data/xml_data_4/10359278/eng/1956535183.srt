Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Grove.

Please tell me you have
the veal piccata tonight.

181
00:08:10,002 --> 00:08:12,466
Just the thought of it
has kept me going all day.

182
00:08:12,491 --> 00:08:16,134
I'm sorry, but I can't seat you.

183
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,639
Oh... oh, you're not overbooked again?

184
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,712
Well, I see our usual table is empty.

185
00:08:20,737 --> 00:08:22,322
I don't know who you promised it to,

188
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,320
Thank you.

- There we go.

190

It's bizarre.

Sorry, darling, is it my imagination,

193
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,345
or are people staring at us?

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,462
I'm wearing Givenchy.

195
00:08:43,487 --> 00:08:45,698
They always stare when I wear Givenchy.

196
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:50,345
No, no, I think, actually,
they're just staring at me.

197
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:53,766
You're right.

198
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,993
It must be your jacket.
I told you plaid is over.

199
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,921
Mr. and Mrs. Grove.

200
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,681
Henry, how lovely to see you.

201
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,102
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid
I have to ask you to leave.

202
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,962
Oh, for God's sake,
he can take the jacket off.

203
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,610
What's wrong?

204
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,196
Someone should have notified you.

this club for 15 years.

Why on earth would you
want to kick us out?

210
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,315
It's because I'm ill, isn't it?

211
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,967
We have to protect our members.

You don't get it by sharing
a fucking tennis court.

Mason Reed over there
is addicted to heroin,

with her brother-in-law.

219
00:09:47,198 --> 00:09:50,423
And you don't want to know
what happens in the club sauna.

220
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,790
That's not helpful.

00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:56,529
For the last time,
Mr. and Mrs. Grove, please go.

I'm curious,

have you had a chance to
discuss Rob's expectations?

pouring his martini.

talented than she is.

Yeah, she wanted to
be a concert pianist,

725
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,912

Based on the initial exam,

has Pneumocystis pneumonia,

738

that we had this conversation.

895
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:06,087
What?

896
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,599
Rob can't know.

897
00:46:11,676 --> 00:46:14,264
I've decided not to leave him.

898
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:17,231
I don't understand.

899
00:46:17,256 --> 00:46:19,014
You don't have to.

900
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:24,364
All you need to do is
give me your solemn vow.

901
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:26,241
Do that...

902
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:29,514
and you have my forgiveness.

903
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:32,342
Okay.

904
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:35,815
I promise.

905
00:46:39,788 --> 00:46:41,423
Thank you, Claire.

906
00:47:12,283 --> 00:47:13,367
Hey, girl,

907
00:47:13,392 --> 00:47:14,685
what are you doing here?

908
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:16,483
She missed you.

909
00:47:16,508 --> 00:47:18,038
Jade.

910
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:20,885
I hope you don't mind.

911
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:24,217
I let myself in. Your lock's busted.

912
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,288
Why do I get the feeling
that you busted it?

913
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:29,381
Don't be mad. I wanted to see you.

914
00:47:29,406 --> 00:47:30,710
Why, so you could break my other leg?

915
00:47:30,734 --> 00:47:32,897
Oh, God, I'm so sorry about that.

916
00:47:32,922 --> 00:47:34,749
Things got a little crazy last time,

917
00:47:34,774 --> 00:47:37,186
but I'm trying to make it up to you.
[CHUCKLES]

918
00:47:39,067 --> 00:47:40,295
See you cleaned a little bit.

919
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,991
It was kind of a pigsty.

920
00:47:42,257 --> 00:47:43,428
Not that I'm being critical.

921
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:45,381
I know you've been busy with, um,

922
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:47,319
jail and stuff.

923
00:47:47,726 --> 00:47:50,741
- And you're cooking?
- Yeah, pot roast.

924
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:52,202
The recipe you like.

925
00:47:52,227 --> 00:47:54,092
Why aren't you cooking
for your rich friends

926
00:47:54,117 --> 00:47:55,834
in their fancy mansion?

927
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:57,788
Did they kick you out?

928
00:47:57,813 --> 00:47:59,616
Eli found out about my past,

929
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:02,519
so I packed up my stuff and I left.

930
00:48:03,952 --> 00:48:05,616
What a shame.

931

[SIGHS]

932
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,311
Did you talk to him?

933
00:48:09,002 --> 00:48:10,561
Now, why would you think that?

934
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:12,964
Because you're the only
one who knows my real name.

935
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,530
Hand to God, I did not tell Eli.

936
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,146
Did you tell someone else?

937
00:48:19,811 --> 00:48:21,717
Taylor came to see me in jail.

938
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,311
Oh, shit!

939
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:26,319
Yeah, she offered to pay my bail

940
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,388
if I ratted you out, so...

941
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:30,249
Taylor is a lawyer!

942
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,850
She knows people,
and the cops are still looking for me.

943
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:34,256
I could end up in prison!

944
00:48:34,281 --> 00:48:36,381
Yeah, and I may be walking
with a cane for a year,

945
00:48:36,406 --> 00:48:37,952
so I guess we're even.

946
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,842
I got to get out of town. I need money.

947
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:43,851
- Don't look at me, I'm busted.
- Well, you must have something.

948
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,476
Like, what about your
grandfather's watch?

949
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,522
- What about it?
- Give it to me! I'll pawn it.

950
00:48:47,547 --> 00:48:48,924
The hell you will!

951
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:52,209
Goddamn it, Duke! You owe it to me!

952
00:48:52,234 --> 00:48:54,538
You really fucked me this time!

953
00:48:54,563 --> 00:48:55,881
I don't owe you shit.

954
00:48:55,906 --> 00:48:58,076
Now get the fuck out of my house!

955
00:48:58,522 --> 00:49:00,600
You stay away from me.

956
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,444
Again with the crazy eyes, huh?

957
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:06,983
Look, baby,
just put the knife down, okay?

Just put the knife...
