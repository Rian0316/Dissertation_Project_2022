第十二季  第三集

23
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,440
佩妮  我們跟鄰居聊天
So, Penny, we were talking to our neighbors,

24
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,460
他們說在考慮賣掉房子搬家
and they're thinking of moving and selling their house.

25
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,400
真的嗎  為什么
Really? Why?

26
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,740
好像跟孩子哭鬧
Something about babies crying

27
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,940
整晚睡不好覺有關  原因不重要
and keeping them up all night; it's not important.

28
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,500
你們倆應該考慮下要不要買
You guys should totally take a look at it.

29
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,760
那樣我們就可以做鄰居了
Then we could be neighbors.

30
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,600
慢著  那我們呢
Hey. Wait a minute, what about us?

31
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,690
我們現在結婚了
I mean, we're married now.

32
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,420
也許我們想買到你們隔壁呢
Maybe we want to buy the house next door.

33
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,100
艾米  我們可不能搬家
Well, Amy, we can't move.

34
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,320
不然我就得換掉我內褲上的所有標簽了
I'd have to change all the tags in my underwear.

35
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,680
你可以買新的
You can buy new ones.

36
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,290
什么  換新房子  還要換新內褲  怎么
What-- new house, new underwear. What am I,

37
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,830
{\an8}美國聯邦司法部管理的證人保護項目
為受到威脅的證人提供新身份與住所

38
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,830
我是進了證人保護計劃嗎
in the Witness Protection Program?

39
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,450
好吧  你們怎么想
Okay. Guys, so what do you think?

40
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,700
我說不好  我們在這里住得挺好
Well, I don't know, w-we're pretty happy here.

41
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,650
對  再說  要是我們想搬家
Yeah. Plus, if we moved,

42
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,850
可能會去市區找一間躍層式公寓
we'd probably just get a loft downtown.

43
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,460
真的嗎
Really?

44
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,060
我一直以為我們會找個帶院子的房子
I always figured we'd get a place with a yard.

45
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,340
行吧  這就說得通了
Oh, sure, yeah, that makes sense,

46
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,460
那你就可以去投籃和修剪草坪了
so you could shoot hoops and mow the lawn?

47
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,660
你倆是怎么結婚的
How are you two married?

48
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,800
你當時在場  我磨得她煩了不得不嫁
You were there. I wore her down.

49
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,700
沒錯
He did.

50
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,090
你們應該在約會的時候
You guys should've talked about all this stuff

51
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,790
就把這些都聊明白
while you were dating.

52
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,200
我和安奴就已經對彼此了如指掌了
I mean, me and Anu already know so much about each other.

53
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,210
慢著  我忘了  安奴是你的脫毛師嗎
Wait, I forget, is Anu your waxer?

54
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,940
不是  那是安妮特
Uh, no, that's Annette.

55
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,800
安奴是我爸給我介紹的相親對象
Anu is the woman my father fixed me up with.

56
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,350
明天我們就要第一次約會了
We're going on our first date tomorrow.

57
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,900
這提醒了我  我得找安妮特脫個毛
Which reminds me, I need to see Annette.

58
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,440
你真的讓你父親來給你挑選妻子嗎
You're really letting your father pick out a wife?

59
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,720
為什么要拒絕
Why not?

60
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,410
包辦婚姻已經延續上千年了
Arranged marriages have been working for thousands of years.

61
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,270
我和安奴出身相仿
Anu and I come from similar backgrounds,

62
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,320
我們的家庭交好
our families get along

63
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,720
我們還各自填了問卷
and we each filled out questionnaires,

64
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,810
這樣就不會把時間浪費在
so we know we're not wasting our time

65
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,480
跟你不匹配的人身上
with someone who's not compatible.

66
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,720
這也太枯燥死板了吧
Oh, that sounds so dry and clinical.

67
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,240
你這個幸運的小子
You lucky duck.

68
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,650
我只是覺得沒有有對方相處過
I just don't think you can truly know someone

69
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,290
是無法真正了解一個人的
until you've spent a lot of time with them.

70
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,810
真的嗎  那佩妮夢想的度假地是哪里
Really? What's Penny's dream vacation?

71
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,410
馬里布海景別墅
Malibu beach house.

72
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,390
那是芭比娃娃的夢想度假地
That's Barbie's dream vacation.

73
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,170
不如你把問卷發給我們吧
Maybe you should send us that questionnaire.

74
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:12,470
讀書還開心嗎
Enjoying your book?

75
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,920
開心得要死
So much.

76
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,980
你為什么要一直在書上戳戳戳
Why do you keep poking at it?

77
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,060
被你發現了  我在手機上購物
Fine, I'm shopping on my phone.

78
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,690
是你說要多讀點書的
You're the one who said you wanted to read more.

79
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,380
對  我還告訴別人我只給孩子吃有機食品呢
Yes, I also tell people I only feed the kids organic.

80
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,950
隨口一說罷了
It's just stuff you say.

81
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,040
好啊
Hello.

82
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,630
玩兒得開心嗎
How was your night?

83
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,360
挺棒的  我們去看即興表演了
Ah, it was great. We went to an improv show.

84
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
他們要觀眾提一個詞來表演
Yeah. They asked the audience to suggest a word,

85
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,400
最后用了斯圖爾特的
and they used Stuart's.

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,780
棒  什么詞
Oh, cool, what was it?

87
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,840
椰子
Coconuts.

88
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,620
這詞太妙了
It was such a good one.

89
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
我靈機一動
It just came to me.

90
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,300
-你們倆在干什么  -讀書
- Uh, what are you guys up to? - Reading.

91
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,080
真好  我也希望能多讀點書
Oh, nice, I wish I read more.

92
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,600
如果讀書對你很重要  那你總能擠出時間的
Well, if it's important, you find the time.

93
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,870
你想參觀下我的房間嗎
You want to see my room?

94
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,140
-好  -好極了
-Yeah. -‭Cool.

95
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,010
你什么感覺
How do you feel about this?

96
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,970
她顯然能找個更好的  不過我沒發言資格
That she can clearly do better, but that's not for me to say.

97
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,940
不  我是說他們在里面干什么呢
No, with them in his room, doing stuff.

98
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,620
不會的  我們就坐在外面
Oh, come on, we're sitting right out here.

99
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,060
他們不會做什么的
They're not gonna do anything.

100
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,270
我想更改答案
I'd like to change my answer.

101
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,270
你真的很擅長涂指甲
Wow, you really are good at this.

102
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,180
我可是用了大把時間給模型上色的人
Well, I've spent a lot of time painting D&D miniatures.

103
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,370
我知道你為此欲火焚身想扒了我的衣服
I know that makes you want to rip my shirt off,

104
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,880
不過先等指甲干了吧
but wait until your nails are dry.

105
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,150
是拉杰
Oh, it's Raj.

106
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,530
他把那份印度婚姻問卷發來了
He sent us that Indian marriage questionnaire.

107
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,740
-快念念  -好
- Ooh, read one. ‭- Okay.

108
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,050
你對宗教有多虔誠
"How religious are you?"

109
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,570
這個簡單  我倆都不信教
That's easy, both of us: not at all.

110
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,560
不  我不是一點都不信
No, I wouldn't say not at all.

111
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,260
我對精神洗滌很感興趣
I mean, I am pretty spiritual.

112
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,390
我會去做瑜伽  所以...
I do go to yoga, so...

113
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,970
好  那你的教堂就是女士彈力褲
Great, so your church is Our Lady of the Stretchy Pants.

114
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,250
下一個問題
Next question.

115
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,750
你和家人有多親密
Uh, "How close are you with your family?"

116
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,910
很親
Pretty close.

117
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
我覺得我家不是很親
I'm gonna say not too close,

118
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,780
我希望再疏遠些
but I'm hoping to get farther.

119
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,020
你對孩子有什么看法
How do you feel about children?

120
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,600
還行吧
Um, they're okay, I guess.

121
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,350
我看到孩子不會對著他扔石頭的
I mean, if I saw one, I wouldn't throw a rock at it.

122
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,090
你為什么要對一個孩子扔石頭
W-Why would you throw a rock at a child?

123
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,260
我說了我不會扔
I just said I wouldn't.

124
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,810
這問題是問你想不想要孩子
The question is would you like to have kids.

125
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,040
答案是肯定的  我們想要孩子
So, yeah, we want kids.

126
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,430
好吧  以后會有的
Yeah-- someday.

127
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,230
嗯  五年內吧
Right, like, in the next five years.

128
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,430
行吧  下一個問題
Sure, uh, next question.

129
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,020
你跟寵物相處得好嗎
"How are you with pets?"

130
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,560
我照顧了謝爾頓十五年
Well, I did take care of Sheldon for 15 years,

131
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,070
他只咬過我兩次
and he only bit me twice.

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,300
在讀了你填的問卷以后  我得說
I have to say, uh, after reading your questionnaire,

133
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,410
我感覺已經很了解你了
I feel like I already know you.

134
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,150
沒錯  我也這么覺得  服務員
Totally. Me, too. Excuse me.

135
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,300
把水換成起泡酒
Can we please get sparkling instead of tap,

136
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,370
上點擦亮的銀器餐具  再看看他們在吃什么
some clean silverware and find out what they're having?

137
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,680
看起來很美味
That looks delicious.

138
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,550
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,510
謝謝
Thank you.

140
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,690
這么說  你是天文物理學家
So, you're an astrophysicist.

141
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,670
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,930
我  我是說  是的
I-I mean, uh, just yes.

143
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,300
除非你想要我稱你為"女士"
U-Unless you prefer "Ma'am."

144
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,000
不必了
I don't.

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,680
好  因為你不像一位高傲的女士
‭Good, because you don't seem like a ma'am.

146
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,320
而是一個小甜心
You seem more like a sweet thang.

147
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,520
你真的對撩妹一竅不通
You are not good at this.

148
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,540
要是我懂怎么撩妹
Well, if I was good at this,

149
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,750
又何必讓我爸來給我安排相親
I wouldn't need to be fixed up by my father.

150
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,670
我也從沒想過我會接受家里的安排
I never thought I'd let my family set me up, either,

151
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,670
可我已經34歲了  我想要孩子
but I'm 34, I'd like to have kids

152
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,620
但我工作太忙沒時間約會
and it's hard to date because I work so much.

153
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,330
對了  你是酒店禮賓
Oh, yes, uh, you're a concierge.

154
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,570
暫時是這樣  我打算五年內自己經營一家酒店
For now. I plan to be managing a hotel in the next five years.

155
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,950
要是能把現在的老板踢走  四年就能搞定
Four, if I can get the current manager out of the way.

156
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,140
他是個煙鬼  祝他好運
He's a smoker, so fingers crossed.

157
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,270
我明白  你知道嗎  我以前給未來的妻子
I-I get it. You know, um, I used to have a long list

158
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,980
列過一長串的要求
of what I wanted from a wife.

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,180
{\an8}美國女演員  一頭濃密棕發  曾憑影片《弱點》獲奧斯卡最佳女主

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,140
要有桑德拉·布洛克那樣的眼睛
Uh, eyes like Sandra Bullock,

161
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,180
桑德拉·布洛克那樣的秀發
hair like Sandra Bullock,

162
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,150
還要有瑞安·斯通那樣的勇氣
and the bravery of Ryan Stone.

163
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,380
那是桑德拉·布洛克在《地心引力》里的角色
That's Sandra Bullock's character in Gravity.

164
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,890
不過現在
But now,

165
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,790
我只希望遇到一個性格好的
I-I just want someone nice.

166
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,420
我覺得我性格很好  你呢
I think I'm nice. Are you nice?

167
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,750
我性格可好了
Oh, I'm definitely nice.

168
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,250
每次有姑娘跟我分手  說的第一句話都是
Every time a girl breaks up with me she always starts with,

169
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,700
"你是個好人"
"You're a nice guy."

170
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,520
聽著  你很貼心
Look, your whole sweet,

171
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,050
你的不自信也很可愛
insecure thing is cute,

172
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,320
但說實話  我沒那么多閑工夫
but honestly, I have no time for that.

173
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,400
如果你不是認真的
If you're not serious about this,

174
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,900
現在就走人
you need to walk away now.

175
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,990
我是認真的
I-I am serious.

176
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,810
很好
Good.

177
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,150
好的
Okay.

178
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,950
好的  這是什么意思
O-Okay, w-what does this mean?

179
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,910
意思就是我可能是未來的...
I think it means I might be the future Mrs....

180
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,740
庫薩帕里夫人
Koothrappali.

181
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,660
如果我不跟夫姓  你會有何感想
How would you feel if I didn't change my name?

182
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,310
有點受傷  但我不會告訴你  因為我是大好人
A little hurt, but you wouldn't know, because I'm too nice.

183
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,120
想去吃午餐嗎
Hey, want to get lunch?

184
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,780
不行
I can't.

185
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,150
哈雷和邁克爾整晚沒睡  我的進度完全落后了
Halley and Michael were up all night, and I'm way behind here.

186
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,710
-他們病了嗎  -不是
- Oh, no, are they sick? - ‭No.

187
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,450
他們只是像兩個小混蛋一樣邊笑邊玩
They were just laughing and playing like a couple of jerks.

188
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,650
他們是很可愛  但什么都被他們毀了
Boy, they're cute, but they ruin everything.

189
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,080
我明白
I get that.

190
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,550
最近我一直在想
You know, I've been thinking lately

191
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,060
也許我不想要孩子
that maybe I don't want kids.

192
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,100
你瘋了嗎
Are you crazy?

193
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,410
你當然要生孩子  他們棒呆了
Of course you want them. It's amazing.

194
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,680
你剛說什么都被他們毀了
You just said they ruin everything.

195
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,800
我有權利這樣說  我笑的時候漏尿是他們的錯
I'm allowed to. It's their fault I pee when I laugh.

196
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,470
等等   為什么我說
Hang on, why is it crazy

197
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,320
不想要孩子就是瘋了
to say I might not want kids?

198
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,290
不是瘋了
Oh, it's not crazy.

199
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,400
只是錯了
It's just wrong.

200
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,740
你只是現在想著你不要孩子
You only think you don't want kids,

201
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,480
但你一旦生了孩子  你會發現其實你是想要孩子的
but once you have kids, you'll realize that you did want them.

202
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,440
又或者我不要孩子  我就不會生孩子  你別管我
Or I don't want them, so I won't have them, so back off.

203
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,380
你這口氣真像我還沒有成為母親
Aw, you sound just like me before I became a mom

204
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,340
沒有領悟愛的真諦的時候
and learned what the meaning of love was.

205
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,140
不敢相信你居然一副高高在上的樣子
Wow, I cannot believe how condescending you're being.

206
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,530
我知道很嚇人  但你會成為很好的母親
Look, I know it's scary, but you're gonna be a great mom.

207
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,200
我知道  但重點是我不想當媽
I know I'd be great, but the point is I don't want to be one.

208
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,320
也許你當不了一個好母親  你的脾氣太爆
Maybe you wouldn't be great. You kind of got a temper.

209
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,700
不是所有人都需要孩子來實現人生價值
You know, not everyone needs to have kids to be fulfilled.

210
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,680
你說得對  你有萊納德了
You're right, you've got Leonard.

211
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,110
還需要什么孩子呢
What more do you need?

212
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,120
-各位  -你好
- Hey, guys. - Hello. ‭

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,160
約會怎么樣
How was your date?

214
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,720
讓我用一個問題來回答
Ah, let me answer that with a question.

215
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,580
你愿意做我的伴郎嗎
How would you like to be my best man?

216
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,480
慢著  你不會真要娶一個
Wait, you're not seriously

217
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,350
只見過一次的女人吧
marrying a woman you've met once.

218
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,330
有何不可  她人很好  我人很好
Why not? She's nice, I'm nice.

219
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,760
我們有可能會和其他夫妻一樣幸福
We're just as likely to be happy as any other two people.

220
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,100
也許更幸福
Maybe even happier.

221
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,060
抱歉  我沒有針對你
Sorry, that was not a swipe at you.

222
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,900
我本來沒覺得你針對我
I didn't think it was.

223
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,580
很好  因為我沒有
Yeah, good, 'cause it was not.

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,580
我個人來說
Well, I, for one,

225
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,800
為拉杰的決定喝彩  他放棄了感情束縛
applaud Raj's decision to forgo emotional attachment

226
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,670
通過屈服于三千年的獨裁傳統
and find a life partner by bowing

227
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,660
找到了人生伴侶
to a 3,000-year-old authoritarian tradition.

228
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,840
你說什么呢
What are you talking about?

229
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,350
你娶了自己愛的女人
You married a woman you're in love with.

230
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,310
我不敢相信你用這件事回擊我
I can't believe you're throwing that back in my face.

231
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,290
你為什么不能為我開心
Why can't you just be happy for me?

232
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,750
因為你這樣很傻
Because you're being dumb.

233
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,470
你對她一點也不了解
You don't know anything about her.

234
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,130
憑什么你們都結婚了
W-Well, how come you all get to be married

235
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,530
就我一個人單身
and I have to stay single?

236
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,230
這問題恐怕要專業的心理咨詢師才能回答
I think that's a question for a licensed professional.

237
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,620
知道嗎  你不僅羞辱了我
You know what, you're not just insulting me.

238
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,310
你還羞辱了我的家人  我的文化
Okay? You're insulting my family, my culture

239
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,190
和我未來的新娘安努
and my future bride, Anu,

240
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,480
她是畢業于康奈爾大學的碩士  她吃素
a vegetarian with a master's degree from Cornell

241
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,290
最愛的水果是菠蘿
whose favorite fruit is pineapple.

242
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,800
我不確定這話是否有幫助  但你們知道嗎
Now, I'm not sure if this helps, but did you know

243
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,790
菠蘿曾經非常稀有
that pineapples were once so rare

244
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,340
查爾斯國王找人繪制肖像時曾讓菠蘿一起入畫
that King Charles posed for a portrait with one?

245
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,530
這話能有什么幫助
How does that help?

246
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,080
幫了我  幾年來我一直設法
Oh, it helped me. I've been trying to slide that

247
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,140
在聊天中提起這事
into a conversation for years.

248
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,220
親愛的  今天過得好嗎
Hey, honey, how was your day?

249
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,250
怎么了
What's wrong?

250
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,780
拉杰說
Raj is talking about

251
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,170
要娶他剛認識的女人
marrying this woman he just met.

252
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,960
我說這樣做很傻  現在他生我氣了
I told him it was dumb, and now he's mad at me.

253
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,860
我有同樣的遭遇
The same thing happened to me.

254
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,250
佩妮說她不想要孩子
Penny said she didn't want kids,

255
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,640
我說她這樣很傻
and I told her she was being silly,

256
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,470
她指責我高高在上
and she accused me of being condescending.

257
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,640
真是瘋了  如果我想要高高在上
Which is crazy, because if I wanted to be condescending,

258
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,390
我會說  啊  你居然會用
I would've said, "Ooh, 'condescending.'

259
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,900
"高高在上"這么高級的詞
That's such a big word."

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,530
我們的朋友為什么不聽我們的勸
Why won't our friends just listen to us?

261
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,760
顯然我們是有經驗的
We obviously know what we're talking about.

262
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,700
我知道
I know.

263
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,880
我們結婚了  我們有很好的孩子
We're married, we have great kids,

264
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,140
很好的工作  很好的房子
great jobs, this great house.

265
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,140
萊納德  還記得昨天
Hey, Leonard, remember yesterday

266
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,890
-我們說以后會生孩子嗎  -怎么了
- when we were talking about having kids someday? - Yeah?

267
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,090
如果不是以后呢
Well, what if it wasn't someday.

268
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,380
我的天
Oh, my God.

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,110
我的天  你懷孕了嗎
Oh, my God, are you pregnant?

270
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,960
沒沒沒  沒有  絕對沒有
No. No. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

271
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:35,140
那...
So?

272
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,630
沒有
No. ‭

273
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,880
我意思是
What I meant was,

274
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,460
如果我們不要孩子呢
what if, what if we didn't have kids?

275
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,990
永遠不要嗎
Ever?

276
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,610
我們的生活這么幸福
I mean, our life is so great.

277
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,270
為什么要改變呢
Why would we want to change that?

278
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,990
當然  當然
Sure. Sure.

279
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:51,890
當然
Sure.

280
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,490
我想在你從沒告訴過我的
And I guess it would be hard raising kids

281
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:57,460
你想要的躍層式公寓里養孩子是挺難的
in the-the loft you never told me you wanted.

282
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,730
-等等  別生氣  -我沒生氣
- Well, wait, don't be mad. - I'm not mad.

283
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,080
我為什么要生氣
Why would I be mad?

284
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,860
根本沒什么可生氣的
There's nothing to be mad at!

285
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,700
你得轉一下那個
You have to-to turn the thing.

286
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
我知道
I knew that!

287
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,060
-萊納德  -我沒生氣
- Hi, Leonard. - I'm not mad!

288
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,910
你安靜得出奇
You're awfully quiet.

289
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,660
-抱歉  -不  我喜歡
- Sorry. - No, I like it.

290
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,380
我有很多煩心事
Got a lot on my mind.

291
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,940
你想談談嗎
Would you like to talk about it?

292
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
不想
Not really.

293
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,050
早餐吃全谷麥片  安靜的行車旅程  
Grape Nuts for breakfast, quiet car ride,

294
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,940
我今天真是事事順心
things are really breaking my way today.

295
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,220
佩妮的重大消息殺了我一個措手不及
It's just Penny hit me with some pretty big news

296
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,040
要消化的東西太多了
and it's a lot to process.

297
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,490
你想安靜地消化  我尊重你
And you'd like to do that quietly. I respect that.

298
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,270
她說她不想要孩子
She said she doesn't want to have kids.

299
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,630
也許她不是認真的
Maybe she didn't mean it,

300
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,940
就像你說你不想談這事
like when you said you didn't want to talk about this.

301
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,000
算了
Forget it.

302
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,500
你想要孩子嗎
Do you want to have children?

303
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,870
我一直以為以后會有的  但現在我發現
Well, I always assumed we would and now I find out, you know,

304
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,070
霍夫斯塔德一家到我這可能就絕子絕孫了
I might be the last of the Hofstadter line.

305
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,700
你哥不是有孩子嗎
Doesn't your brother have children?

306
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,000
還有你姐  她保留了娘家姓
And your sister. She kept the Hofstadter name

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,230
生了五個健康的兒子
and has five healthy boys:

308
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,180
尼爾  杰弗里  斯科特  威廉  還有理查德寶寶
Neil, Jeffrey, Scott, William and baby Richard.

309
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,590
我還是繼續安靜吧
I'm going back to being quiet.

310
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,570
太好了
Sweet.

311
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,510
我能坐下嗎
Hey. Mind if I sit?

312
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,580
你是來告訴我  我犯下了天大的錯誤嗎
Did you just come here to tell me I'm making a gigantic mistake

313
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,360
因為我點了藍莓松餅
by having this blueberry muffin

314
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,990
我應該像你一樣吃肉桂卷
and I should've got a cinnamon roll like you did?

315
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,750
不是
No.

316
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,430
那就好  因為我對自己的選擇很滿意
Good, 'cause I'm happy with my choice.

317
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,570
不過那個肉桂卷確實挺香的
Although that cinnamon roll does smell good

318
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,090
你能分我一半嗎
if you're open to halfsies.

319
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,780
-行吧  -謝謝
- Fine. ‭- Thanks.

320
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,510
昨天的事我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

321
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,420
你說得對  我當時太...
You're right. I-I was being...

322
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,390
我的老天鵝  太好吃了
Oh, my God, that is so good!

323
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,180
等會再說吧
I can wait.

324
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,890
不  抱歉
No... Sorry.

325
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,250
你繼續
Go on.

326
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,280
我們認識很久了
I've known you a long time.

327
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,390
你是我見過的最相信浪漫的人
You believe in romance more than any person I've ever met

328
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,170
看到你放棄  我很難受
and it's hard to see you give up on that.

329
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,440
但如果你真覺得跟這個女人結婚
But if you really think marrying this woman

330
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,370
能讓你快樂
is gonna make you happy,

331
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,690
那我全心全意支持你
then you have my complete and total support.

332
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,240
我會陪你走過每一步
I will be with you every step of the way.

333
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,130
謝謝  霍華德  這番話意義重大
Thanks, Howard. That means a lot.

334
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,050
那婚禮會在印度舉行嗎
So, hey, is this wedding gonna be in India?

335
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,180
有可能哦
Ah, maybe.

336
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,430
搞毛啊  佩妮
What the hell, Penny?!

337
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,890
你得說具體一點我才知道
I'm gonna need more than that.

338
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,930
你不打算生孩子
You're not having kids?

339
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,820
你怎么能這樣對我
How could you do this to me?

340
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,120
這關你什么事啊
How is it any of your business?

341
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,930
因為你的小孩本該當我家小孩的朋友
Because your kids were supposed to be friends with my kids.

342
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,800
現在誰來當他們的朋友
Who's gonna be friends with them now?

343
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,670
他們會交到其他朋友啊
They will find other friends.

344
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,710
當然了  因為擁有我和謝爾頓基因的小孩
Oh, sure, 'cause Sheldon's DNA plus my DNA

345
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,470
一定八面玲瓏很會交朋友  成熟一點
equals a kid who knows how to make friends. Grow up!

346
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,110
這是我和萊納德兩個人的事
This is between me and Leonard.

347
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,390
萊納德吃屎吧  我們本該一起懷孕
Screw Leonard! We were supposed to get pregnant together.

348
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,710
一起孕吐
We were gonna be barf buddies.

349
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,750
并用維他命E幫對方
We were supposed to massage each other's perineums

350
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,200
按摩會陰
with vitamin E.

351
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,880
你現在就快把我說吐了
I'm about to be your barf buddy right now.

352
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,430
聽著  你有小孩后
Listen, when you have kids,

353
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:15,610
我還是會陪在你身邊
I'm still gonna be there.

354
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,810
我會是他們好玩的佩妮阿姨  給他們糖吃
I'm gonna be their fun Aunt Penny who gives them candy,

355
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,030
教他們罵臟話
and teaches them swear words

356
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,130
還會跟他們說媽媽有多奇葩
and tells them stories about what a weirdo their mother is.

357
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,220
這我應該能接受
I guess I could live with that.

358
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,150
真正艱難的是放棄我們
What is gonna be hard is letting go of the dream

359
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,460
用母乳喂養彼此小孩的夢想
of us breastfeeding each other's babies.

360
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,420
忘記你說過這段話也很艱難
And it's gonna be hard to forget you said that.

361
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,100
拒絕
No.

362
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,310
要是我說浴袍底下的我
What would you say if I told you

363
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,460
一絲不掛  你有什么想法
I was totally naked under this robe?

364
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,520
我會覺得還不錯
I would say that sounds pretty good.

365
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,190
真的嗎  還真沒料到
Really? Well, I did not see that coming.

366
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,110
馬上就好
One second.

367
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,260
不是吧
Oh, come on.

368
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,400
等等  別被嚇軟
Wait. Stay in the mood.

369
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,410
我來放我們的音樂  蓋過他們
I'll put on our own music and drown them out.

370
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,390
{\an8}小甜甜布蘭妮熱單《Work Bitch》

371
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,390
這是什么
What's this?

372
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,170
我健身專用的合集
It's from my workout mix.

373
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,880
我鍛煉臀大肌時就聽這首歌
It's what I listen to when I'm firming up my glutes.

374
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,090
你去看看他吧
Can you get him?

375
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,500
好
Sure.

376
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,670
-霍華德  -干嘛
- Hey, Howard. - ‭Yeah?

377
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,680
你緊實的臀大肌看起來能夾爆核桃
It looks like you could crack a walnut in those glutes.

378
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,860
不行  我試過了
I can't. I tried.

379
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,320
我給你做了晚飯
I-I made you dinner.

380
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,020
你的最愛  快餐店買的漢堡拆了包裝用盤子裝起來
Your favorite: In-N-Out Burger out of the wrapper on a plate.

381
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,740
謝謝  但你不必這么做  我沒事
Thank you, but you don't have to do this. I'm fine.

382
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,120
我知道這不是嬰兒  但被捧起時它也會漏汁[尿]哦
I-I know it's not a baby, but it does leak when you pick it up.

383
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,990
你不是吧  現在還拿這個開玩笑了
Really? We're joking about this now?

384
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,300
不是的  對不起
No, look, I'm sorry.

385
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,230
我不是有意這么突然就告訴你的
I didn't mean to just drop all of this on you.

386
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,780
我只是很驚訝
I-It just took me by surprise.

387
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,490
我以前常想象生孩子的事
I-I always imagined having kids.

388
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,660
我知道
I know you did.

389
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,240
但我想象過很多
But I've imagined having a lot of things

390
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,750
我永遠也得不到的東西
that I'm never gonna get:

391
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
{\an8}《蝙蝠俠》中的高科技戰車

392
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,480
諾貝爾獎  能開的蝙蝠戰車a Nobel Prize, a working Batmobile.

393
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,970
但我也擁有很多從沒想過能得到的事物
But I also have a lot that I never thought I'd have...

394
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,780
比如你
like you.

395
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,180
你確定這就足夠了嗎
Are you sure that's enough?

396
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,370
是的
Yeah.

397
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,340
-你真能接受這個決定  -是的
- You're really okay with this? - ‭I am.

398
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,560
爸爸
Hey, Daddy.

399
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,480
萊納德說
What's this Leonard says

400
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,720
你不想給我生外孫  怎么回事
about you not wanting to give me grandbabies?

401
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,320
他可能有其他想法  先閃了
He might feel differently. Bye.

402
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,340
我告訴爸媽我們第一次約會很順利
I told my parents our first date went well

403
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,000
他們很興奮
and they got very excited.

404
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,010
可不是嘛
Oh, tell me about it.

405
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,360
我爸媽也高興壞了
My parents were so thrilled,

406
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,990
他們竟然跟對方說話了
they actually spoke to each other.

407
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,610
那結局并不美好
So that was a disaster.

408
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,570
干杯
Cheers.

409
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:09,920
好了  如果我們要舉行婚禮
Okay. I guess if we're going forward with this wedding,

410
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,560
現在該討論接下來的步驟了
we should talk about the next steps.

411
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,780
你是指婚禮主題和用哪些花嗎
Oh, like themes and flowers?

412
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,530
其實是財務和稅務
Actually, finances and taxes.

413
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,270
我們不能用這個
Oh. We can't use that.

414
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,320
這是我爸媽的離婚主題
That was the theme of my parents' divorce.

415
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,860
我知道錢可能會使新婚夫婦
I know that money can be a source of friction

416
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,150
產生摩擦  我希望能避免這一點
in a new marriage and I want us to avoid that.

417
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,320
當然了  對
Of course. Yeah, right.

418
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,760
這樣很明智
That's s-smart.

419
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,150
我的會計強烈建議
So, my accountant feels strongly

420
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,830
我們婚后第一年分別報稅
that we should file separately the first year

421
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,630
之后再根據我們的共同資產重新評估
and then we can re-evaluate based on our joint assets.

422
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,920
你還好嗎
You okay?

423
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,410
我不能這么做
No, I can't do this.

424
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,850
為什么
Why not?

425
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,530
我有些方面你可能不太了解
Th-There's something you may not know about me

426
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,450
因為我們只見過一次面  但是
'cause, you know, we've only met once, but...

427
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,980
我浪漫得不可救藥
I'm a hopeless romantic.

428
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,170
你看起來很優秀
And you seem great

429
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,720
我也確實想結婚
and I do want to get married.

430
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,930
想定下來  但是
I-I do want to settle down, but...

431
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,320
這不是我以后想告訴孫輩的愛情故事
this isn't the story that I want to tell my grandkids.

432
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,990
我懂
I understand.

433
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,630
要是浪費你時間了  我很抱歉
I'm so sorry if I wasted your time.

434
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,460
拉杰
Raj.

435
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,030
我知道我們彼此不太了解
I know we don't know each other very well,

436
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,910
但你看起來會是個好父親
but you seem like you'd make a good father

437
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,640
而且你夠高  我不怕穿上高跟鞋會比你高
and you're tall enough so I can wear heels and...

438
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,290
我認為這就值得我們為之努力了
I think that's something worth fighting for.

439
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,640
你愿意娶我嗎
Will you marry me?

440
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,770
天啊天啊天啊
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

441
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,400
當然愿意  我當然愿意娶你
Yes, of course, of course I'll marry you!

442
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,310
-你想的話可以吻我  -太好了
- If you'd like to kiss me you can. - ‭Oh, great.

443
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,220
先提醒你一下  我有舌釘
I should warn you I have a tongue piercing.

444
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,210
你也沒那么乖嘛
Oh, you're not that nice.

445
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,150
你要告訴我這是去哪兒嗎
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?

446
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,680
因為如果目的地有"農貿"或"市場"這幾個字
Because if it has the words "Farmers" or "Market" in it,

447
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,900
我不想去
I don't want to go.

448
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,020
你之前說到有些事物
You were talking about all the things

449
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,530
你認為自己永遠都得不到
you thought you would never have,

450
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,940
所以我就送你一樣
so I thought I would get you one.

451
