00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,582
<i>All right. There you go.</i>

36
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:33,407
<i>That completes our week-long

40
00:07:37,768 --> 00:07:40,062
Of course,
I am open to requests.

41
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:43,588
That's right.
All you gotta do is call me.

42
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,953
Anytime.

43
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:47,548
All right?

44
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,378
Bye. Call me.

45
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,206
Boundaries, Mrs. Nguyen.
Boundaries.

46
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:56,000
Why are you here?
You lose that job already?

47
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:57,198
I should be so lucky.

48
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,762
You don't like your job?

49
00:07:58,764 --> 00:07:59,793
Boo-hoo. Poor baby.

50
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:04,951
You know, some people work for a living.
No one gives us free cars.

51
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:05,816
So why you here?

52
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:09,643
This place is paid up. I'm within
my rights as your legal tenant.

53
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,107
That's all you need to know.

54
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:13,935
Do I smell coffee?
Have you got a pot on?

55
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:14,800
Why?

56
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,597
How about a fill-up?

57
00:08:16,598 --> 00:08:18,892
You can afford to buy your own!

58
00:08:18,894 --> 00:08:22,620
Faster I get coffee,
the faster I'm out of here.

59
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,200
<i>Chao cac co,</i> ladies.

60
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:49,704
Son of a...

61
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:27,936
You haven't unpacked yet?

62
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,332
Kevin and Paige are here.

63
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:32,128
Absolutely.

64
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:01,143
I don't know exactly what
Chuck may have said to you,

65
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:06,201
but just so you know, I did not
ask him to step in on my behalf.

66
00:10:25,236 --> 00:10:27,296
Hi, guys! Sorry for the wait.

67
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,093
Not a problem. Hi.

68
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,323
So good to see you again.
Howard.

69
00:10:31,325 --> 00:10:31,922
Hi, Kim.

70
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,517
Good to see you, too!
Hi, Paige. Hi, Kevin.

71
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,383
Kim, great to see you.

72
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,279
Please have a seat. Thank you.

73
00:10:37,281 --> 00:10:38,543
Kevin, how's your grandson?

74
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:42,969
Out of control. Just running
circles around all of us.

75
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,159
Hello. Can I help you?

76
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,953
You know why I'm here?

77
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:51,014
He needs an answer.

78
00:11:55,974 --> 00:12:00,165
Respectfully,
I'm gonna have to say no.

79
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:06,453
You sure about that?

80
00:12:06,455 --> 00:12:08,017
I am.

81
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,022
Your Honor, the defense has made
the very reasonable request

82
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,985
that the plaintiffs produce their
medical records, or barring that,

83
00:13:21,987 --> 00:13:26,477
a signed HIPAA release so that we
can examine the records ourselves.

84
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:28,208
Your Honor, our clients'
medical records

85
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,537
have no bearing on
the merits of this case.

86
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,300
The medical records
are plainly relevant

87
00:13:32,302 --> 00:13:33,997
as they bear directly
on our contention

88
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,826
that the plaintiffs are not
adequate class representatives.

89
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:41,583
This is a transparent attempt
at intimidation, nothing more.

90
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:41,983
How so?

91
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,578
Many of our clients have information
in their medical records

92
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,574
that they prefer
to keep private.

93
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:47,773
They're fearful,
as any of us would be,

94
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,370
at the thought of
a bunch of strangers

95
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:50,900
poking around in
their personal files.

96
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,232
And by forcing them
to reveal this information,

97
00:13:52,234 --> 00:13:55,493
the defense is banking on them
simply dropping out of the case.

98
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:59,020
Your Honor, this is about class
certification. That's all.

99
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:00,783
If the named
plaintiffs are suffering from

100
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,280
dementia or other
mental deficiencies...

101
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,578
You're saying
they're incompetent?

102
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,441
I'm saying we have
a right to any record

103
00:14:05,443 --> 00:14:06,606
that would speak
to their competency

104
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:07,903
as regards this class
certification issue.

105
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,133
Your Honor, it seems like the
defense wants it both ways, then.

106
00:14:10,135 --> 00:14:12,162
If our clients are
suffering from dementia,

107
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:13,626
then the residency
contracts they signed

108
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:16,022
with Sandpiper couldn't have
been entered into knowingly.

109
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,087
No. No,
that is not what we...

110
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,716
The defense wants to claim that
their residents are competent enough

111
00:14:19,718 --> 00:14:23,608
to be held to their contracts,
but too incompetent to sue.

112
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,141
So which is it?

113
00:14:24,143 --> 00:14:26,836
Many of the residents signed
their contracts years ago.

114
00:14:26,838 --> 00:14:29,565
And at the time, they
were perfectly competent.

115
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:30,596
But that can change,

116
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,525
especially when we're talking
about elderly individuals.

117
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,652
Or maybe Sandpiper preyed on
mentally incompetent seniors

118
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,183
and bilked them
out of their money.

119
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,614
Ms. Wexler...

120
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:44,339
I am simply trying to defend our
clients from bullying by the defense.

121
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,268
Your Honor, as stated in
the brief in front of you,

122
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,694
this is a standard request granted
in every case of its kind.

123
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:52,857
This is not about bullying.

124
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,720
Granting this
invasion of privacy

125
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:56,750
allows our clients to
be doubly victimized.

126
00:14:56,752 --> 00:15:00,377
I ask that you deny the
defense's motion, Your Honor.

127
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:02,439
I'm leaning toward
granting the motion,

128
00:15:02,441 --> 00:15:05,334
but I would like to review the
pleadings and briefs again.

129
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:08,329
I'll have my
decision for you shortly.

130
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:10,126
Adjourned.

131
00:15:15,385 --> 00:15:18,810
I'm gonna meet you
back at the office.

132
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,927
Ms. Wexler?

133
00:15:27,929 --> 00:15:28,659
Hey.

134
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,920
I just wanted to say,
good work in there.

135
00:15:31,922 --> 00:15:33,950
Thanks. But I'm
pretty sure I lost.

136
00:15:33,952 --> 00:15:36,213
Of course you did.
It's an unwinnable position.

137
00:15:36,215 --> 00:15:38,143
That's why your boss
didn't bother showing up.

138
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:42,168
But you went down swinging,
and I admire that.

139
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:43,233
Thank you.

140
00:15:43,235 --> 00:15:45,396
What are you doing for lunch?

141
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:48,824
Probably just grabbing something
from the vending machines.

142
00:15:48,826 --> 00:15:51,951
Oof.
We can do better than that.

143
00:15:53,783 --> 00:15:55,545
Mr. Schweikart.
Good to see you, sir.

144
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:56,743
How you doing, Sean?
Very well.

145
00:15:56,745 --> 00:15:59,970
Can I get some drinks for you two?
Your usual Moscow Mule?

146
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:00,569
Absolutely.

147
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:04,428
You want one? Best
Moscow Mule in the city.

148
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,588
Fresh ginger, real
copper mug, the works.

149
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,350
That's very vintage.
But I'm good.

150
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,879
Just an iced tea. You sure?

151
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,609
All right, then.
I'll be the sole degenerate

152
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:17,805
who's drinking in
the middle of the workday.

153
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,868
That, too, is vintage.

154
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,763
I'll get those started.

155
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:27,721
So, you've been with HHM,
what? Ten years?

156
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:31,048
Yeah. Last August.

157
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,543
And you started
in the mail room?

158
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,873
I did. I was six years there.

159
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:36,638
How did you know that?

160
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,268
I asked around.
It's a small town.

161
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,461
It sounds like you
certainly paid your dues.

162
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:43,326
I was very fortunate.

163
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,688
HHM put me through
law school while I worked.

164
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,986
That's great that they
foster talent like that.

165
00:16:46,988 --> 00:16:50,181
And I imagine you're paying
it off as part of your deal?

166
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,046
Yeah, happily.

167
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:52,543
It's a pretty
standard arrangement.

168
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,138
I have to say,
watching you in court today,

169
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,566
it sure did bring back
some old memories for me.

170
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,897
One in particular, anyway.

171
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,026
Yeah? I was a year
out of law school

172
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:05,986
at this firm in Boston, and I was
finally put on my first big case.

173
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,581
This huge employment
discrimination suit.

174
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,943
That thing kept us in
billing for a decade.

175
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:13,673
Anyway, we landed this monster,

176
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:15,702
and I find out I'm
second chair to one of

177
00:17:15,704 --> 00:17:17,632
the partners on
the preliminary hearing.

178
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:19,662
And I think, "This is it!"

179
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,889
"This is what will define
the rest of my career."

180
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:25,052
So, the hearing's
getting closer and closer.

181
00:17:25,054 --> 00:17:27,315
I even get this new
suit that I can't afford.

182
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:29,045
I split it over
three credit cards.

183
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,072
I'm probably still
paying it off to this day.

184
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:37,063
So, I go in bright and early, I'm
wearing my new suit, prepping my table,

185
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:39,160
and in walks
the opposing counsel.

186
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:39,859
There's four of them.

187
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:43,186
One senior partner and three
high-level associates.

188
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,312
These guys have been litigating
longer than I've been alive.

189
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:49,308
But I think... ""

190
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:52,136
"I'm good, I've got my boss
coming, it'll be fine."

191
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:58,392
So I'm sitting alone at my table,
waiting for my boss to show.

192
00:17:58,694 --> 00:18:00,988
And I'm waiting.
And I'm waiting.

193
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:04,415
And then suddenly they're calling
us to order, and I realize

194
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,742
that no one from my firm is coming.
It's just me.

195
00:18:07,744 --> 00:18:10,937
So I think, "All right, then.
This is the moment."

196
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:13,865
And I get up there and I argue
like my life depended on it.

197
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:17,691
I'm sweating and I'm citing
statutes left and right.

198
00:18:17,693 --> 00:18:20,553
And I'm doing okay.
Respectable.

199
00:18:20,555 --> 00:18:24,746
But I'm just a BB gun
to these four howitzers.

200
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:28,971
And I lose, of course.

201
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,036
It was inevitable.

202
00:18:30,038 --> 00:18:35,893
But later, it hit me that my
boss never intended to show.

203
00:18:36,826 --> 00:18:38,088
And they all laughed about it.

204
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,683
They patted me on the back,
said it was my trial by fire.

205
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:43,312
And I laughed with them.
But, you know,

206
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:46,040
it never really
sat well with me.

207
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,337
You want them to have your back.

208
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:52,562
Because at the end of the day, it
wasn't about proving my mettle.

209
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:57,021
My boss had a tee time
that he didn't want to miss.

210
00:18:58,488 --> 00:19:00,848
I wasn't there long.

211
00:19:03,412 --> 00:19:07,868
Could I ask why we are here?

212
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:10,630
You know, I've had my
eye on you for a while.

213
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:14,557
Since that Kettleman thing. It was
an excellent deal you got for him.

214
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,914
And I'm wondering why someone who
can put together a deal like that

215
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,973
is arguing a losing
position with no backup.

216
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,666
I have no complaints about HHM.

217
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,561
That's great. However,

218
00:19:30,563 --> 00:19:33,955
if on the off-chance
you're pondering a change,

219
00:19:33,957 --> 00:19:35,652
Schweikart & Cokely
would be more than happy

220
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,148
to put your talents to good use.

221
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:39,379
I...

222
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,743
Of course we'd have to have
a more formal meeting,

223
00:19:40,745 --> 00:19:45,002
work out specifics, but we think
you would be a great fit.

224
00:19:48,464 --> 00:19:52,988
Well, I'm flattered, but there's
clearly an ethical issue here.

225
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,251
Well, of course,
we'd take you off Sandpiper.

226
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:56,948
And rest assured,
we wouldn't be expecting

227
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,876
any information
about HHM's strategy.

228
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:03,037
Look, we're a large,
diversified firm.

229
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,098
And just think what you
can do with our resources

230
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,024
and the freedom to
really spread your wings.

231
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,015
That's...

232
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:17,976
I owe a lot to HHM.

233
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:21,704
Your tuition debt?
We could take care of that.

234
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:25,031
That's very generous.

235
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:27,592
Well, give it some time,
you think about it.

236
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,325
And you give me a call,

237
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:32,418
and we'll set up a meeting with
the rest of the senior partners.

238
00:20:32,719 --> 00:20:34,846
And, to be clear,

239
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:36,942
I'm talking partner track.

240
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,406
Jesus, Sean, did you have
to send to Moscow?

241
00:20:39,408 --> 00:20:43,098
Sorry for the
wait, Mr. Schweikart.

242
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,694
Are we ready to order?

243
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:01,711
<i>For the gourmet Quick Chop.</i>

244
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:04,240
<i>It's the fastest,
easiest and safest way</i>

245
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:08,066
<i>to chop, mince or dice
any vegetable. Guaranteed.</i>

246
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:08,831
<i>Here's how it works.</i>

247
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,427
<i>Just place the vegetable on
the board, give it a tap,</i>

248
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:13,756
<i>and you've got finely
shredded cabbage in seconds.</i>

249
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:17,782
<i>For crunchy coleslaw.
Tap again and chop celery...</i>

250
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:19,146
<i>for a delicious stir-fry.</i>

251
00:24:19,148 --> 00:24:21,775
<i>It even works on
your tougher vegetables.</i>

252
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:22,374
<i>Like potatoes.</i>

253
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,837
<i>Make home fries
with just one tap.</i>

254
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,833
Get down.

255
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:28,596
Get down.

256
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:31,025
<i>Quick Chop peels and chops it
with just a tap.</i>

257
00:24:31,027 --> 00:24:33,221
<i>Keep tapping for freshly minced garlic.</i>

258
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,415
<i>The secret's the six
carbon steel blades,</i>

259
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:37,846
<i>combined with
the rotating action.</i>

260
00:24:37,848 --> 00:24:41,640
<i>Each time you tap, it rotates
and chops on a different angle,</i>

261
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:42,571
<i>and never misses a thing.</i>

262
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:45,765
<i>One tap, and you've got
sliced onions for burgers.</i>

263
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,962
<i>A few more taps,
and you've got...</i>

264
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,892
What's the message?

265
00:24:49,994 --> 00:24:51,223
Take the $5,000.

266
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:54,117
It took two guys
to tell me that?

267
00:24:55,384 --> 00:24:58,144
We were just supposed to scare you.
That's all.

268
00:24:58,146 --> 00:25:00,739
Then try harder next time.

269
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,669
Get out.
<i>It has the power to chop nuts.</i>

270
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:04,465
<i>Almonds, walnuts, pecans.</i>

271
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:07,793
<i>The Quick Chop even has
the muscle to crush ice.</i>

272
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:08,691
Get out.

273
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,621
<i>Call now and
you'll get Quick Chop</i>

274
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,518
<i>for $14.99. But that's not all!</i>

275
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,213
<i>We'll also include the grater
and the gripper free.</i>

276
00:25:15,215 --> 00:25:18,840
<i>Remove the blades
and it instantly converts...</i>

277
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:48,081
Hey, Julie. Come on in.

278
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,776
I've got those
Sandpiper documents.

279
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:51,841
Great, just put them anywhere.

280
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:54,403
Howard asked if you could
go through them now.

281
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:56,300
It's 1:15. I was just
about to grab some lunch.

282
00:26:56,302 --> 00:26:59,727
Yeah. He needs them done by
2:30 so he can draft a letter.

283
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:03,620
I brought these. Figured I could
petty cash a lunch order for you.

284
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,480
I got accounting to approve
that new fancy salad place.

285
00:27:26,248 --> 00:27:27,011
Kaylee.

286
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:31,570
Kaylee, come on.
Not too far from the side.

287
00:27:31,838 --> 00:27:34,665
Throw the ball, Pop-Pop.

288
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,986
When are we going home?

289
00:27:40,988 --> 00:27:42,783
What?

290
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,813
You don't like it here?

291
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:46,443
It's okay.

292
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:48,074
"It's okay"?

293
00:27:48,076 --> 00:27:51,401
You've got a pool.
What more do you want?

294
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,798
I guess.

295
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,159
You guess? You guess? Well...

296
00:27:56,161 --> 00:27:58,123
You want to come out of there?

297
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:58,755
No! I'm staying.

298
00:27:58,757 --> 00:28:01,450
Well, you want me to come
in there and get you?

299
00:28:01,452 --> 00:28:04,179
I can't have you in
a pool that's only "okay."

300
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,608
It's good! It's good!

301
00:28:10,303 --> 00:28:12,131
You sure? You sure?

302
00:28:12,133 --> 00:28:14,427
I'm sure!

303
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,117
Kaylee, honey,
it's time to come out now.

304
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,681
Just a few more minutes!

305
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:00,744
No. You do what Pop-Pop says.

306
00:29:00,746 --> 00:29:05,070
Come on, baby, before
you turn into a prune.

307
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,334
Miss?

308
00:30:40,336 --> 00:30:41,731
The gentleman
would like me to let

309
00:30:41,733 --> 00:30:44,293
you know that your
next drink is on him.

310
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,487
Just let me know
when you're ready.

311
00:31:13,842 --> 00:31:15,737
I'm ready.

312
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,414
I wasn't sure that was gonna work.

313
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:32,407
Don't tell me that's the
first time you've done that.

314
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:33,872
So, what kind of
return on investment

315
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:36,566
are you getting on these drinks?

316
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,861
None as pretty as you.

317
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,124
Man.

318
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:49,510
I'm Dale, by the way.

319
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:51,739
Giselle.

320
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:06,679
Okay, item number 44,
what do we have?

321
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:12,303
Residency contract
for Abigail Hildreth.

322
00:32:17,229 --> 00:32:19,656
"Abigail Hildreth."

323
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:22,152
And what's the date on that?

324
00:32:22,154 --> 00:32:25,546
Dated August 1st, 1999.

325
00:32:26,113 --> 00:32:29,372
August 1st, 1999.

326
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,236
August 1st, 1999.

327
00:32:31,238 --> 00:32:35,595
And do we have the corresponding
deposition for Mrs. Hildreth?

328
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:37,225
Yes.

329
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:58,287
Have you ever heard the expression,
"A watched pot never boils"?

330
00:33:04,445 --> 00:33:05,873
Here it is.

331
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,303
Thank you. See?

332
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:11,763
I've got her down as item 12.

333
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,725
Date of depo, September 15th.

334
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,222
September 15th.

335
00:33:16,224 --> 00:33:19,216
Fifteenth of September.

336
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,381
September 15th.

337
00:33:20,383 --> 00:33:22,743
Or yeah, September 15th.

338
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:26,404
Thank you.
Okay, item number 45.

339
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:33,292
Jimmy?

340
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:37,517
It's my grandma. She's old.

341
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,647
I'll be right back.

342
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:41,943
Kim?

343
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:44,172
<i>How fast can you get downtown?</i>

344
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:45,836
Santa Fe downtown?

345
00:33:45,838 --> 00:33:47,466
<i>Albuquerque.</i>

346
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:48,664
Why?

347
00:33:48,666 --> 00:33:50,960
I'm at the bar at Forque.

348
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,320
And I've got a live one on the hook.

349
00:33:57,317 --> 00:34:00,509
I'm on my way. What's the shot?

350
00:34:00,578 --> 00:34:01,907
Definitely two or three.

351
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:04,869
You don't think they do?
They could.

352
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:07,531
I know, but they don't have to.

353
00:34:09,596 --> 00:34:13,553
That's possible, but I don't
understand why that's an issue.

354
00:34:13,555 --> 00:34:14,784
You can always go back.

355
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:15,982
Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:19,908
Viktor! There you are!

357
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:22,238
So sorry I'm late.
I had to put out a few fires.

358
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,901
No problem.
I made a new friend.

359
00:34:23,903 --> 00:34:25,565
Dale, my brother Viktor.
Hey, how you doing?

360
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:28,593
Nice to meet you, Dale. Thanks
for keeping sis company.

361
00:34:28,595 --> 00:34:29,458
My pleasure.

362
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,385
You need a drink.
Let's get you a drink.

363
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:35,880
So, what do you do, Dale?

364
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:37,776
I'm an engineer.

365
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:40,438
Like Casey Jones, with the hat?

366
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,766
No, idiot.
An engineer-engineer.

367
00:34:43,768 --> 00:34:45,164
Not an "engineer."
Dale builds things.

368
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,491
I design things. Spillways
and drainage fields, mostly.

369
00:34:48,493 --> 00:34:50,188
I don't actually build them.

370
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,052
Well, that's cool. Yeah.

371
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:55,578
But you could still wear the hat, though.
Right? Nothing stopping you.

372
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,277
Yeah, I guess I could.

373
00:34:56,279 --> 00:34:58,473
I'm just saying there's no rule
about that, as far as I know.

374
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:01,534
You are such a brat!
Why the good mood?

375
00:35:01,536 --> 00:35:03,963
Did it go well today?

376
00:35:03,965 --> 00:35:06,126
Please tell me it went well.

377
00:35:06,128 --> 00:35:08,388
Yeah, it went well.

378
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:11,750
Very well? Like, very, very?

379
00:35:11,752 --> 00:35:14,977
Beyond our wildest... Yeah.

380
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:17,040
Whoo!

381
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:19,303
How many of these has she had?

382
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:21,499
I'm just getting started, baby!

383
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:22,430
Remember these faces, Dale!
Giselle.

384
00:35:22,432 --> 00:35:25,158
They're gonna be on the cover of
<i>Fortune Magazine,</i> January issue.

385
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,390
Giselle. Please.
Dale's a good guy.

386
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:28,386
He's not gonna do anything.
You're boring the man.

387
00:35:28,388 --> 00:35:30,084
No, no, not really.

388
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,580
Thank you.

389
00:35:31,582 --> 00:35:34,077
All right, I'm off to
the little girl's room.

390
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,568
Say only nice things about me
while I'm gone, okay?

391
00:35:42,496 --> 00:35:44,691
She's something.

392
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,387
Yeah.

393
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:53,375
So, Giselle was telling me you
two are starting a business?

394
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:56,935
What exactly did she tell you?

395
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,531
Nothing much.
Just something about a dotcom.

396
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:04,888
Some way for people to hook up with
each other using the Internet?

397
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,483
Look, I'm sure
you're a nice guy,

398
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:10,345
but she was
talking out of school.

399
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:12,674
We're full up on this thing.

400
00:36:12,676 --> 00:36:13,239
Okay.

401
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:16,600
We sign one more investor,
we gotta go public.

402
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:19,728
And I'm just... No.

403
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,321
We cannot take anyone else on.

404
00:36:23,323 --> 00:36:24,519
No offense.

405
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:26,682
It's okay. Yeah.

406
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:31,573
No worries.

407
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:27,807
Spread your arms.

408
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:40,550
No.

409
00:37:43,514 --> 00:37:44,776
He's got a gun.

410
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:47,638
I don't care about the gun.

411
00:38:40,146 --> 00:38:44,703
Tomorrow, you go to
the district attorney.

412
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:49,927
And you explain to him that
my nephew's gun was yours.

413
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:54,818
The DA will ask you, "Why you
didn't say anything before?"

414
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,312
You tell him you forgot.
You were rattled.

415
00:38:58,314 --> 00:39:01,806
Make up anything you want,
I don't give a shit.

416
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:04,035
But it's your gun.

417
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:08,394
Let's discuss my payment.

418
00:39:08,396 --> 00:39:12,720
That time has passed.
No $5,000 for you.

419
00:39:12,722 --> 00:39:14,216
The price is $50,000.

420
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:17,577
How about your
payment is you get to live?

421
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:19,541
Not enough.

422
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:22,236
You think you can
negotiate with me?

423
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:26,761
I say the word, my nephews
go to a certain motel.

424
00:39:26,763 --> 00:39:29,090
Pay a visit to
your daughter-in-law

425
00:39:29,092 --> 00:39:31,885
and your little granddaughter.

426
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,414
What do you think happens then?

427
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:39,106
Consider your
position carefully.

428
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:42,134
I get my money,

429
00:39:42,136 --> 00:39:45,228
or neither of us
walk out of here.

430
00:39:54,547 --> 00:39:58,005
You're willing to die for this?

431
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:03,761
Maybe I need the $50,000
more than you do.

432
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:21,497
How you manage to live so
long with a mouth like that?

433
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,218
$50,000.

434
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:32,876
And the gun is yours.

435
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:12,839
He sent you?

436
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,502
I volunteered.

437
00:41:14,837 --> 00:41:17,729
Only safe way for us to talk.

438
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:38,061
You really pushed it in there.

439
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:43,850
That thing we did?

440
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,543
He finds out, we're both dead.

441
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:49,639
You get that, right?

442
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,301
What thing we did?

443
00:41:57,461 --> 00:41:59,755
What's this? $25,000.

444
00:41:59,757 --> 00:42:01,053
What for?

445
00:42:01,055 --> 00:42:05,245
We made a deal.
I didn't hold up my end.

446
00:42:06,046 --> 00:42:10,935
Your problem is coming back
sooner than we expected.

447
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,697
You gonna cash that? I might
know a guy who can help.

448
00:42:33,031 --> 00:42:35,624
It's better as a souvenir.

449
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:39,650
I figured you'd be,
maybe, I don't know,

450
00:42:39,652 --> 00:42:41,647
a touch happier this morning.

451
00:42:41,649 --> 00:42:43,909
Maybe a smidge? Possibly?

452
00:42:43,911 --> 00:42:46,705
I am. I'm totally happy.

453
00:42:46,906 --> 00:42:49,366
Why wouldn't I be?

454
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,029
I...

455
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:56,187
I had a job offer.

456
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,850
Really? From where?

457
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:01,379
Schweikart & Cokely.

458
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:02,443
Seriously?

459
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,007
Rich Schweikart
said that they would

460
00:43:04,009 --> 00:43:06,736
even pay off my
law school loans.

461
00:43:06,738 --> 00:43:07,734
That's great!

462
00:43:07,736 --> 00:43:10,528
Please let me be there
when you tell Howard.

463
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,159
Please.

464
00:43:12,261 --> 00:43:13,856
So why the sad puppy eyes?

465
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:15,187
What, you don't want that job?

466
00:43:15,189 --> 00:43:18,015
No, no, of course I do.
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

467
00:43:18,017 --> 00:43:21,675
It's a huge firm. You get
out from under Howard's thumb.

468
00:43:21,677 --> 00:43:22,474
Right. Exactly.

469
00:43:22,476 --> 00:43:27,365
Besides, HHM is looking more and
more like a dead end for me anyway.

470
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:30,393
Exactly. So what's the problem?

471
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,322
I just...

472
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:39,844
I don't know.

473
00:43:39,845 --> 00:43:43,670
I keep thinking of you
floating in that pool.

474
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,993
You knew what you wanted,
but I got in the way.

475
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:51,190
What are you talking about?

476
00:43:51,192 --> 00:43:55,183
You took the Davis &
Main job because of me.

477
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:58,343
I took that job because it
was the right decision.

478
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,941
A steady pay check? Done.

479
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:04,233
A place to live that's more than,
five square feet? Boom.

480
00:44:04,235 --> 00:44:06,562
A car that's all one color?
Nailed it.

481
00:44:06,564 --> 00:44:10,721
I'm good.
I got what I wanted.

482
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:12,318
And you?
With this Schweikart thing?

483
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,080
You could have
everything you ever wanted.

484
00:44:15,082 --> 00:44:17,809
What's not to love about that?

485
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:22,633
Yeah. What's not to love?
