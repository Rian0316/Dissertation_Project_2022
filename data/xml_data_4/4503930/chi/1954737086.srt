全场的座位都湿了
There's not a dry seat in the house.

4
00:00:13,586 --> 00:00:16,488
如果那些女士这么喜欢轻度折磨
If those ladies are that into light torture,

5
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:19,724
她们就应该申请我们的工作
they should just apply for our jobs.

6
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:21,459
嘿
Hey.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,062
哦 你们俩真让人羡慕
Aww, you two are so adorable.

8
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:29,100
就像罗密欧和朱丽叶 只是没有美好的未来
Like Romeo and Juliet, but without the bright future.

9
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,902
对...
Yeah...

10
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:33,171
我要他离开餐厅
I want him out of the diner.

11
00:00:33,172 --> 00:00:34,405
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:34,406 --> 00:00:35,840
在这间餐厅工作的所有人
Anyone who works in this diner

13
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,642
都像是坐在斯玛特车里的胖子
is like a fat guy in a Smart car.

14
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:39,978
永远别想出去
You can never get out.

15
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:41,379
没错
It's true.

16
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,882
1962年 我为了一杯咖啡来到这里
I came in here in 1962 for a cup of coffee.

17
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:49,487
有人让我兑开一美元 我就没离开过了
Someone asked me to break a dollar, and I never left.

00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:52,490
听我说 和同一个人一起生活 工作 睡觉
Look. Living, working, and sleeping with the same guy

19
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:54,359
绝不是个好主意
is never a good idea.

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,528
不信去问希拉里·克林顿
Just talk to Hillary Clinton.

21
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,430
我想我还是能炒掉一个洗碗工的
I guess I can get a dishwasher fired.

22
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:03,634
当我还是有钱人时 我曾把沃尔夫刚·帕克从他自己的餐厅炒掉
When I was rich, I got Wolfgang Puck fired from Wolfgang Puck.

Get yours, Max!

25
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:08,139
先干 再走
Hit it then quit it.

26
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,810
在我二三十岁的时候 这方法对我很管用
That strategy served me well in my 20s and 30s.

27

不上也行
Or don't.

35
00:01:38,358 --> 00:01:40,359
谁在乎呢?
Who gives a crap?

36
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,195
有人心情不好哦 怎么了 Oleg?

37
00:01:43,196 --> 00:01:47,265
Axe身体喷雾停产了吗?
Did they discontinue making Axe body spray?

38

不许开这个玩笑
Don't even kid.

39
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:53,171
不是 我心情不好是因为我现在没有做爱
No. I'm cranky because I'm not having sex right now.

40
00:01:53,172 --> 00:01:55,073
是啊 我还想着 在你说话时能看见你的两只手
Yeah. I thought it was weird seeing both your hands

41
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,676
真是奇怪
while you were talking.

42
00:01:57,677 --> 00:02:00,278
Sophie的主意 这是某种古老的波兰礼仪

新郎和新娘在婚礼前的30天里
The bride and groom remain chaste for 30 days

44
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,549
不能做爱
before the wedding.

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,418
显然 在婚礼上伤心的
Apparently, the "something blue" at the wedding

46
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:09,888
应该是我的蛋蛋
has got to be my balls.

47
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,423
这么说 你是在练习禁欲
So, you're practicing celibacy.

48
00:02:11,424 --> 00:02:13,892
我在努力 但是女人无处不在
I'm trying, but there are women everywhere.

49
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:18,530
我觉得自己像是阴道群里的公牛
I feel like a bull in a vagina shop.

50
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,331
安静 听我说!
Hear ye, hear ye!

51
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:23,501
我要公布餐厅的一个重要改进!
I'm unveiling a major improvement to the diner!

52
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:26,204
我们会想你的 Han

53
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:29,140
想得美 Max 但是就像瑞安·西克莱斯特
Nice try, Max, but like Ryan Seacrest,

54
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:29,140
{\an8}"美国偶像"主持人

我做的每件事都可能是最后一件
Every step I take could be my last.

61
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,793
现在...
And now...

62
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,695
不用说无脑台词...
Without further a-douche...

63
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,030
准备好让你的心怒放了吗?
Ready to have your minds blown?

64
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:57,301
这里插一句 我准备好让一切怒放了
At this point, I'm ready to have anything blown.

65
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,237
当当!
Ta-da!

66
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:01,572
这是我收到过的最糟糕的礼物
That is the worst gift I ever received

67
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:04,374
去年 我儿子买给我的是棺材
and last year, my son bought me a coffin.

68
00:03:07,912 --> 00:03:10,514
这个真的很棒 因为不是给你的
This works out great then, because it's not for you.

69
00:03:10,515 --> 00:03:12,049
是给Nash的
It's for Nash.

70
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,352
哦 那真的是很好
Oh, well, that's real nice.

71
00:03:14,353 --> 00:03:17,655
因为Max家的淋浴器完全坏了
Because the shower at Max's place doesn't work at all.

72
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,523
你最好认为它很好
You better believe it's nice.

73
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,492
这可是"喷头5000"
That's the Spritzy 5000.

74
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:25,596
"洗碗工周报"给它评了四个盘子的高分
Dishwasher Weekly gave it four out of four Dishies.

75
00:03:25,597 --> 00:03:28,599
你知道我们的烤箱坏了 对吧?
You know our oven doesn't work, right?

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,070
嘿 老板娘 要是我们努力工作 我们也有礼物吗?
Hey, boss lady, if we work hard, do we get a gift?

77
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:35,306
要是你努力工作 那我就死时无子女
If you work hard, I'll die childless

78
00:03:35,307 --> 00:03:37,841
而且我会惊讶地张着嘴死掉
with my mouth frozen open in shock.

79
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,244
对 我说过了!
Yeah, I went there!

80
00:03:40,245 --> 00:03:45,282
Nash工作努力 所以只有他能使用我漂亮的管子!
Nash works hard, so only he may handle my beautiful hose!

81
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:46,884
要是他用上了Han的管子
Well, if he's handling Han's hose,

82
00:03:46,885 --> 00:03:49,553
那他不可能被炒了
he's never getting fired.

83
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:51,121
好了 站上来 Nash
Okay. Step up here, Nash.

84
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:53,256
我给你展示下 这小东西能做什么
I'll show you what this puppy can do.

85
00:03:57,294 --> 00:04:01,298
目前 这小东西拿不到水管
So far the puppy can't reach the hose.

86
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:03,299
帮个忙
A little help.

87
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,106
哦 没什么比一个帅哥抱着个婴儿更可爱的了
Aww, there's nothing cuter than a hot guy holding a baby.

88
00:04:12,743 --> 00:04:16,546
现在只要抓着它 挤到它喷出来就可以了
Now just grab that thing and squeeze it till it sprays.

89
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,883
在婚礼前 请暂停使用"抓""挤"
Move to call a moratorium on the words "grab," "squeeze,"

90
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,184
"喷"这些词
and "sprays" till the wedding.

91
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:33,263
天啊! 真性感
Damn! That's hot.

92
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:36,833
我什么都不做 就能看到他裤子里的东西
And me without any singles to stuff down his pants.

93
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,836
我还是去男厕所弄干吧
Well, I better go dry off in the men's room.

94
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,838
别占着茅坑太久
Don't be too long in that stall.

95
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,374
我下次中间休息时 还要跟拿着蓝多湖黄油袋子的女士
I've got a date with the Land O'Lakes butter package lady

96
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,874
约会
on my next break.

97
00:04:53,883 --> 00:04:57,220
对不起 女士们 我全湿了
Oh. Pardon me, ladies. I'm all wet.

98
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,092
Max? 你看到我眼前的景象了吗?
Max? Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

99
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,294
那些女生看着他 就好像他是Sizzler's(泰国)餐厅的
Those ladies looking at him like he's a senior special

100
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,297
高级服务生?
at Sizzler's?

101
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,233
我们也许不能让Nash被炒
We might not be able to get Nash fired,

102
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:12,936
但我们可以让他被雇为时尚模特
but we can get him hired as a fashion model.

103
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,470
看看她们的脸
Look at their faces.

104
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,373
他可以成为CK(时装品牌)的未来巨星
He could be the future bulge of Calvin Klein.

105
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:19,342
你现在在聊未来吗?
Now you're talking about the future?

106
00:05:19,343 --> 00:05:21,477
你怎么就不肯承认 我们因一个很垃圾的礼物
Why can't you just accept that we are stuck

107
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:23,780
而陷入困境了呢?
with a really crappy present?

108
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,748
不准说"喷头5000"的坏话!
Quit trash-talking the Spritzy 5000!

109
00:05:32,688 --> 00:05:34,891
下午好 欢迎光临"糕潮"
Good afternoon. Welcome to The High.

110
00:05:34,892 --> 00:05:36,759
我去让人给你拿杯水
I'll have somebody get you some water.

111
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,462
不是我 因为我不做这种事了
Not me, 'cause I'm past that.

112
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:41,597
也就在这里不做
You know, here.

113
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:43,766
我觉得我又为了我们老板 让一个拉拉相亲会的人
I think I just sat another one of those lesbian blind-dates

114
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,401
坐下了
for our boss.

115
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:48,170
在外面给皮条客干活真不容易
It's hard out there for a pimp.

116
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:50,473
你为什么以为我不干拉皮条了?
Why do you think I got out of pimping?

117
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,942
因为有人在我头上爆了一个啤酒瓶
That and someone broke a beer bottle over my head.

118
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,977
你给Nash找到模特工作了吗?
So, did you get Nash a modeling job yet?

119
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:56,445
我正在找
I'm working on it.

120
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:59,281
这不是给泰拉·班克斯(超模)打个电话就行的
It's not like I can just call Tyra Banks.

121
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:01,984
那是我打过去的时候 她的人说的
Well, that's what her people said when I called.

122
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:05,287
呃 电话治疗进行了好久
Ugh, phone therapy ran long.

123
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:07,823
显然 罗茜(主持)离开"观点"节目给我带来的问题
Apparently I have more issues than I realized

124
00:06:07,824 --> 00:06:11,594
比想象中更多
about Rosie leaving The View.

125
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:14,263
我的约会对象们到了吗?
Are my dates here yet?

126
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:16,899
不要告诉我 是她 她 或者她
Please don't tell me it's her, her, or her.

127
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,302
就是她 她 以及她
It's her, her, and her.

128
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,104
赶走她们
Lose them.

129
00:06:22,105 --> 00:06:23,906
我要怎么赶走她们?
How am I supposed to get rid of them?

130
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:26,075
大家想让拉拉走的时候怎么说的 就怎么说
Just say what anyone says when they want a lesbian to leave,

131
00:06:26,076 --> 00:06:29,945
"外面有辆斯巴鲁 可以拿到票哦"
"There's a Subaru outside that's about to get a ticket."

132
00:06:29,946 --> 00:06:31,547
你要是在十年前告诉我
If you had you told me, ten years ago,

133
00:06:31,548 --> 00:06:35,717
我会上一个约会网站 叫"拉拉约会"
I'd be on a dating site called "Lez Meet Up,"

134
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:38,887
我就会告诉那位跟我结过婚的年轻牧师
I would've told the youth pastor I was married to,

135
00:06:38,888 --> 00:06:43,458
"你已经疯了"
"You've lost your mind."

136
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:46,828
哦 我刚收到
Oh, I just got some interest

137
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,864
Del Monico模特经纪公司的回复
from the Del Monico Modeling Agency.

138
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:50,799
但他要有照片去面试
But for the interview, he needs photos.

139
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,702
不能是你手机里他屁股的照片
And not just the pictures of his butt on your phone.

140
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:55,670
好吧 你搞定
Fine, you handle it.

141
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,339
我对于模特行业的了解仅限于
The only thing I know about modeling is

142
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,875
几年前 我曾是医疗网上带状疱疹的封面模特
a couple of years ago, I was the face of shingles on WebMD.

143
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:12,554
姑娘们 来让我拍照的时机刚刚好
Girls, perfect timing to ask me to do this photo shoot.

144
00:07:12,555 --> 00:07:15,857
联邦调查局上周刚把我的相机还给我
The FBI just gave me my camera back last week.

145
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,293
他们把你的相机还给你了
Oh, so you get your camera back,

146
00:07:18,294 --> 00:07:19,961
可我却还在等那一公斤的
but I'm still waiting on that kilo of coke

147
00:07:19,962 --> 00:07:24,533
我花了几小时小心塞满我屁股的可卡因?
that I spent hours carefully filling my butt with?

148
00:07:24,534 --> 00:07:26,301
我来改一下设置
Let me just change the settings.

149
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:31,840
这台相机原本是用来拍摄800英尺(250米)外的照片的
This camera is used to taking pictures from 800 feet away.

150
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:35,176
把照片还给我们 Oleg!
And we want those pictures back, Oleg!

151
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:37,245
嘿 大家好!
Hey, everybody!

152
00:07:37,246 --> 00:07:38,747
就管我这叫"高潮期"吧
Just call me "rush hour traffic"

153
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:42,851
因为我太饥渴了
'cause I sure am horny.

154
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:47,055
哦 Caroline 真不知道你这么多多
Oh, Caroline, I do not know how you go years, and years,

155
00:07:47,056 --> 00:07:50,358
多多多多年
and years, and years, and years, and years

156
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:53,661
是怎么守住贞操的
without doing the nasty.

157
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:56,564
这才这么多多年
It's only been years and years.

158
00:07:56,565 --> 00:07:58,800
- 拜托  - 多多多年
- Come on.  - And years.

159
00:07:58,801 --> 00:08:01,035
我想来份鲜肉三明治
Well, I could go for a brisket sandwich.

160
00:08:01,036 --> 00:08:02,504
打烊了 Sophie
We're closed, Sophie.

161
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:06,007
我知道 我自己有带
I know. I got one in my purse.

162
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:09,744
还有你们为什么在这肮脏的洗碗间里拍大片?
And why are you doing the photo shoot in this skanky dishroom?

163
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:13,114
因为我们打算用"性感洗碗工"的主题
Because we're going with the "hot dishwasher" angle.

164
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:15,316
经纪公司说每个模特都要有勾引人的噱头
The agency said every model needs a hook.

165
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:17,318
比如辛迪·克劳馥的美人痣
Yeah, like how Cindy Crawford has a beauty mark

166
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:19,654
还有安娜·妮可·史密斯的死
and Anna Nicole Smith is dead.

167
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:24,258
没错 我妹妹在波兰也是名模特 她也有"勾"引人的地方
Yeah, yeah. My sister is a model in Poland and she has a hook.

168
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,863
就是她的左手 用来烤肉串一级棒
It's her left hand, yeah. It's is also great for kabobs.

169
00:08:28,864 --> 00:08:30,465
出来吧 Nash!
Come on, Nash!

170
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:32,567
脚步里带点爱尔兰的活力
Put a little Irish Spring in your step.

171
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,268
我有点小紧张
I'm a little nervous.

172
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:37,004
我唯一一次拍照是在学校
The only other time I had my picture taken was at school.

173
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:41,576
神父说他需要一个光膀子的人来点名
The priest said he needed a shirtless one for the roll call.

174
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,646
你上的是什么学校 "猎捕恋童癖"圣母学院?
Where did he go to school, Our Lady of To Catch a Predator?

175
00:08:41,577 --> 00:08:45,646
{\an8}美国真人秀节目

176
00:08:45,647 --> 00:08:49,550

说话注意点 Sophie
Careful, Sophie.

178
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:52,586
这是我的小鲜肉
That's my brisket.

179
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,589
我说的可不是这位丹尼尔·戴-卢瑟
I'm not talking about Daniel Day-Loser here.

180
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:55,589
{\an8}丹尼尔·戴-刘易斯 奥斯卡影帝 爱尔兰籍 

181
00:08:55,590 --> 00:09:00,027
我说的是Oleg
I'm talking about Oleg.

182
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:04,632
你全身流汗就像是条被太阳
You are sweating like an old knockwurst

183
00:09:04,633 --> 00:09:09,603
烤出油的老香肠
that has been left out in the sun.

184
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:13,908
让人垂涎欲滴
It's really breathtaking.

185
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:17,678
好了 Nash 拿着水管站在这
Okay, Nash, stand over here near the hose

186
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,381
摆出目光呆滞的性感面孔
and give me hot face, dead eyes.

187
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,483
就像我把白加黑的日夜片混着吃一样
You know, like me when I mix NyQuil and DayQuil.

188
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,752
我管它叫下午片
I call it AfternoonQuil.

189
00:09:24,753 --> 00:09:26,487
好了 我要开始拍摄了
Okay. Now I'm gonna start shooting.

190
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:30,691
对 摄起来 宝贝! 摄起来!
Yeah. Shoot, baby! Shoot!

191
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:32,226
你觉得怎样?
What do you think?

192
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,895
表情的确僵硬 但不是无神那种
Well, he's stiff, but not in the good way.

193
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,530
啊 真是受不了
Ugh, this is painful.

194
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,733
他就像是没星范的苏珊·鲍尔
He's like Susan Boyle without the star quality.

195
00:09:36,531 --> 00:09:39,733
{\an8}苏珊·鲍尔: 因参加"英国达人秀"而一夜爆红

196
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,835
我们得弄成像上次那样
We need a little of what he had the other day.

197
00:09:41,836 --> 00:09:43,837
你之后会为此感谢我的
You'll thank me for this later.

198
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,008
对 Nash 就是这样!
Yes, Nash, yes!

199
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:52,112
把衣服撕破!
Tear your shirt!

200
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:55,981
- 就是这样  - 哦 就是这样
- Yeah, yeah.  - Oh, yeah, yeah.

201
00:09:58,786 --> 00:10:02,789
住手!
Stop!

202
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,692
这里什么情况?
What the hell is happening in here?

203
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:07,828
我没同意把餐厅借给你们
I didn't give anyone permission to use my diner

204
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:09,129
拍大片啊
for a photo shoot.

205
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,430
别激动
Calm down.

206
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,465
我们想帮他找份模特的工作
We are trying to get him a modeling job.

207
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:15,335
他有工作! 他是我的头号员工
He has a job! He's my number one worker.

208
00:10:15,336 --> 00:10:18,038
就像医生在你妈生你时说的话
Like the doctor said to your mother when you were born, 

209
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,673
运气不佳
tough break.

210
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,341
你们两个坏家伙什么都不肯给我!
You two crows don't let me have anything!

211
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,783
好了 Nash 模特面试的一部分
Okay, Nash, part of the model audish

212
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:32,452
是看你在广告里的表现
is to see how you'd be as a performer in commercials,

213
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,988
还有电影 还有别的没人看的东西
and movies, and other things people don't watch anymore.

214
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:36,923
显然 作为新手
Now, obviously, right out of the gate,

215
00:10:36,924 --> 00:10:40,093
你比不上Aflac广告里的白鸭子
you're not gonna be as good as that duck who says "Aflac,"

216
00:10:40,094 --> 00:10:43,463
但你至少要比本·阿弗莱克强
but you've got to be at least as good as Ben Affleck.

217
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:46,099
我能帮上忙 有段时间 我的演艺事业挺辉煌的
I can help. For a time, I had a rich acting career.

218
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,167
最开始是"安妮"里的一个小角色
It started with a starring role in Annie,

219
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,736
最后扮演的是罗莎·帕克斯
and ended when I portrayed Rosa Parks

220
00:10:48,168 --> 00:10:49,736
{\an8}罗莎·帕克斯: 黑人人权运动之母

221
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,170
因为这个考虑不周的高中舞台剧
in an ill-advised high school production

222
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:53,840
引起了有色人种协进会的调查
that led to an investigation by the NAACP.

223
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:57,710
哦 这是早餐麦片的广告!
Ooh, this is a commercial for breakfast cereal!

224
00:10:57,711 --> 00:11:00,513
啊! 每个演员的梦想啊!
Ah! Every actor's dream!

225
00:11:00,514 --> 00:11:01,748
嘿 Nash 读一下
Hey, Nash, read this.

226
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,382
想象自己是詹姆斯·迪恩
Think James Dean.

227
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:03,382
{\an8}詹姆斯·迪恩: 好莱坞青春偶像

228
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:07,620
但要有生气 还要假装在吃可可米花
But alive and eating Cocoa Puffs.

229
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,589
"美味的可可米花是任何
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part

230
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,060
营养搭配的早餐的必备品"
of any well-balanced breakfast."

231
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:15,428
我在想要怎么说得客气...
I'm trying to find a nice way to say...

232
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:19,465
你逊毙了 伙计
You suck, bro.

233
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:21,167
你... 你懂吧
You... you get it.

234
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:23,436
在通常不吃巧克力的时段
You know the thrill of eating chocolate

235
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:26,706
吃巧克力的兴奋感
at a traditionally non-chocolatey time of day.

236
00:11:26,707 --> 00:11:29,241
往这方向想
Let's tap into that.

237
00:11:29,242 --> 00:11:30,543
好的 从头开始
Okay. Take it from the top.

238
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,179
但这一次 疯狂(杜鹃)点
And this time, go cuckoo.

239
00:11:30,544 --> 00:11:33,179
{\an8}麦片的吉祥物

240
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,482
我为可可米花狂
Go cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

241
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:37,717
"美味的可可米花..."
"Cocoa Puffs are a delicious..."

242
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,752
打住
Stop.

243
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:43,422
别这样子来 这不是葡萄干麦片
Don't phone this in. It's not Raisin Bran.

244
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,857
"美味的割口迷花..."
"Pocoa Cuffs are a delicious..."

245
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,759
"割口迷花"?
"Pocoa Cuffs"?

246
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,895
割口迷花?
Pocoa Cuffs?

247
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:53,465
我受不了这些糟糕透顶的业余者 Caroline
I just can't with these rank amateurs, Caroline.

248
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,967
Max 冷静点
Max, calm down.

249
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:56,902
这是麦片广告的试演
It's a fake tryout for a cereal commercial,

250
00:11:56,903 --> 00:12:00,105
不是"舞蹈妈妈"
not Dance Moms.

251
00:11:56,903 --> 00:12:00,105
{\an8}舞蹈真人秀 其中的舞蹈老师略毒舌

252
00:12:00,106 --> 00:12:02,808
我太紧张了 我不是演戏的料
I'm nervous. I'm not an actor.

253
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,710
可不 你才不是
Uh, no, you are not.

254
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:07,079
把它给我
Give me that.

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,014
啊哈 啊哈 啊哈
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

256
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:12,651
行了
Got it.

257
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:16,088
美味的可可米花是任何早餐的必备品!
Cocoa Puffs are a delicious part of any well-balanced breakfast!

258
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:17,689
有益健康 父母最爱
They're good for you, which parents love,

259
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,125
糖果味道 我的最爱!
and they taste like candy, which I love!

260
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:23,128
我忍不住了! 我为可可米花狂!
I can't help it! I'm cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

261
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:26,598
狂!
Cuckoo!

262
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:31,470
我要流泪了 而且不是因为这房间里长了黑霉
I'm tearing up, and it's not just the black mold in here.

263
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:34,873
Max 我觉得你把演戏水准定太高了
Max, I think you may have just set the acting bar too high.

264
00:12:34,874 --> 00:12:36,441
哦
Oh.

265
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:39,744
我从没把酒吧闹得太嗨过(标准定太高)
I've never set a bar too high before.

266
00:12:39,745 --> 00:12:43,348
我只是烧过酒吧 嗨着离开酒吧过
I've set a bar on fire and I've left a bar too high.

267
00:12:43,349 --> 00:12:44,950
嘿 姑娘们
Oh, hey, girls.

268
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:47,786
介意我在你们这待一会儿吗?
Oh, do you mind if I hang down here with you for a while?

269
00:12:47,787 --> 00:12:50,689
Oleg在楼上 他想色诱我
Oleg is up there, he's trying to seduce me

270
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,190
他正在打扫公寓呢
by cleaning the apartment.

271
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:56,294
而且那场面 太"肮脏"了
And it's, oh, oh, so dirty.

272
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,967
不好 他在用真空吸尘器 也就是说他也是"真空"的
Oh, oh, he's vacuuming now, which means he's naked.

273
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:07,472
哎 我和我的波兰价值观啊
Oh, me and my Polish values.

274
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:09,340
波兰价值观?
Polish Values?

275
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,910
跟我在布鲁克林最喜欢的一元店同名啊
That's the name of my favorite dollar store in Brooklyn.

276
00:13:13,112 --> 00:13:17,782
啊 他在深层清理那团粗毛
Oh, he's deep-cleaning the shag.

277
00:13:17,783 --> 00:13:19,818
天啊 来个人帮帮我
Oh, my God. Somebody, do something

278
00:13:19,819 --> 00:13:22,220
别让我老想着滚床单
to make me not want sex.

279
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:25,288
好了 Nash 展示下你的台步吧?
All right, Nash, why don't you show us your runway walk?

280
00:13:28,826 --> 00:13:30,328
就这样
That was it.

281
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:33,664
我还以为你要去拿支笔呢
Oh, I thought you were going to pick up a pen.

282
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,500
谢谢 好极了
Thanks, perfect.

283
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:39,804
现在性趣全无了
Now I'm completely turned off.

284
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:44,041
看那家伙走过去 简直出奇地有效
Watching that potato walk across the room really did the trick.

285
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,843
Nash 集中精力
Nash, concentrate.

286
00:13:45,844 --> 00:13:47,145
跟我学
Follow my lead.

287
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:48,479
右扭 左扭 右扭 左扭
Bam. Pow. Bam. Pow.

288
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,648
前一步右扭 转过身左扭
And step and bam, and step and pow,

289
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,717
退一步右扭!
and step and bam!

290
00:13:52,718 --> 00:13:55,019
这下更好了！
Oh, even better!

291
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,356
看完这个 我可以拿私处
I mean, after that, they could film the sequel

292
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:01,224
拍"冰雪奇缘"续集了
to Frozen on my lady parts.

293
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,831
同感

因为我的下面"随它吧"

老娘憋不到婚礼了!

他走得很熟练
He's bamming and powing up a storm.

00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:56,054
他出名了以后希望他还能记得我们
When he's famous, I hope he remembers us.

306

Nash准备了可可米花的广告
Nash rehearsed the Cocoa Puffs commercial.

313
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:14,539
我想你会被他打动的

不一样的内容
a little different today.

316
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:21,980
别慌 这种情况经常发生
Don't panic. They do this all the time.

317
00:15:21,981 --> 00:15:23,448
他们就是想看看你能否随机应变
They want to make sure you're flexible.

318
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:24,916
开始吧 Nash
Yeah. Go ahead, Nash.

319
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:28,253
不管是什么牌子的麦片 假装它很好吃就行了
Whatever cereal it is, act like it's delicious.

320
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:31,589
除非是"米脆"的 它们的广告太无聊!

00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,733
我们是拿漏了一页吗?
Uh, are we missing a page?

325
00:15:41,734 --> 00:15:45,036
和我小时候知道的麦片广告差太多了
Cereals have changed since I was a kid.

326

327
00:15:46,572 --> 00:15:48,072
没穿内裤的内容吗?
the teacher's not wearing any panties?

329
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:52,443
怪不得外面等着的人都好奇怪

别大惊小怪的
Don't act so surprised.

00:15:58,217 --> 00:16:02,787
是人都知道可可米花就是色情片的代号

Max, this has gone too far.

348
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:45,646
我知道 我一开始也只是以为你是来暂住几天

349
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,666
然后就会找到自己的公寓
for a couple of days and get your own place.

350

我们真的要为了不让他在餐厅工作
Are we really gonna let Nash do porn

351
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,502

小姐们 你们讨论出据结果了吗?

439
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:43,296
我会恨死我自己的
follow your dreams.

440
00:20:43,297 --> 00:20:48,067
即使那意味着你要搬出去住了
Even if it means you moving out of the apartment, too.

441
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:51,804
去吧
Now go.

442
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,539
眼泪都流出来了
Here comes that tear again.

443
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,575
我都要哽咽了
I'm all choked up.

444
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:59,547
Max 你演罗莎·帕克斯一定很棒
Max, you would have made a great Rosa Parks.

445
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:01,148
如果你是黑人的话
If you had been black

446
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,763
我猜他们关注的点就是这个
which I guess is what they insist on.

447
00:21:05,521 --> 00:21:08,534
但至少你让他搬出去了! 你真棒
But you got him to move out! You are good.

448
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,969
他也许长得是帅 不过...
Yeah, well, I mean... he is cute, but...

449
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,943
但我也没那么为他痴狂
I'm not all that coo coo for his Cocoa Puffs.
