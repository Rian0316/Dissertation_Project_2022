有谁会在做爱的时候说这样的话啊
Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?!

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:08,621
我不知道  高潮时刻  情不自禁嘛
I don't know. It was the heat of the moment!

4
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:10,211
放屁  高潮时刻应该是说
No, the heat of the moment is

5
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:11,551
"对  太爽了"
"Ooh, yeah, just like that."

6
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,411
而不是说"你愿意嫁给我吗"
Not, "Will you marry me?"

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:20,081
可航空航天局很想把我的望远镜装上太空站
NASA really wants my telescope up on the Space Station,

8
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:23,071
所以他们要让我提前升空
so they're putting me on an earlier launch.

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,141
什么时候
When?

10

I'll call them back.

00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,551
等你回来咱们再举办婚礼
We'll have the wedding when you get back.

18

你爸会气疯的
Your dad's going to be furious.

19
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:44,841
他不可能会同意我们延迟婚礼
There's no way he's going to let us postpone this wedding.

20
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,151
至少咱们努力过
Well, we tried.

21
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,201
我去跟他谈
I'll talk to him.

22

他不会拒绝他的宝贝女儿的
He won't say no to his little girl.

23
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:53,601
不  应该我去跟他谈
No! I, uh, I should talk to him.

24
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,131
来场男人跟男人间的对话
Man to man.

25
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,941
好吧  我跟你说老实话
All right, look, I'm going to level with you.

26
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,481
我很害怕进入太空
I'm terrified about going into space.

27
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:03,591
要是我回不来怎么办
You know, what if I don't make it back?

28
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,851
会没事的  女婿
It's going to be okay, son.

29
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:08,931
你真的这么想吗
You really think so?

伯纳黛特那么漂亮
A pretty girl like Bernadette,

32

肯定会找到新归宿
she'll find a new guy.

00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:18,941
时至今日...

34
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,221
发射步骤12  显示正常

35
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,891

42
00:01:38,171 --> 00:01:40,701

完毕
Check.

84
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,252
因此被人拿来形容基

85
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,252
他叫你果麦圈客  是因为你那基友发型吗
He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?

86
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,222
不  是因为我跟妈妈住
No, it's... 'cause I live with my mom

87
00:03:55,222 --> 00:03:57,392
她有帮我弄水果麦圈早餐

00:03:58,132 --> 00:04:01,142
还是用你很基的原因吧  那个比较好接受
Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.

94
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:19,232
还没有  两位不介意的话
Not exactly. Listen, if you don't mind,

95
00:04:19,232 --> 00:04:21,572
我真的不打算聊天了
I'm not really up for chatting.

96
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:23,072
我只想静静坐在这里
I'm just going to sit here quietly

97
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:26,382
让我的人生在眼前一一闪现
and let my life flash before my eyes.

98
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:32,062
闪现得太快了  我再试一遍

108
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,662
回头带到太空站里去
so I can take it to the International Space Station.

109
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:05,272
那样的话  等我回家
That way, when I come home,

110
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:09,252
你就能拥有一颗上过太空的星
you will have a star that was actually in space.

111
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:12,062
天啊
Oh... my God.

112
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,282
接招吧  送过你礼物的弱爆男人们

113
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:20,052
这是我收到的最棒的礼物
This is the most amazing gift I've ever gotten.

114
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,442
真的吗  你真这么喜欢的话
Really? Well, if you like it that much,

115
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,132
闭上眼睛  伸出手来
then close your eyes and put out your hand.

116
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:31,622
我要去超市给你买路上吃的零食
I'm going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip!

00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,652
不要  我吃水果麦圈的时候
No! When I eat Froot Loops,

120
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,972
别的宇航员都取笑我
the other astronauts make fun of me!

121
00:05:45,162 --> 00:05:46,722
霍华德  我不想等到
Howard, I don't want to wait until

122
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,962
你回来再结婚
you're back to get married.

123
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,362
什么
What?

124
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,232
我想在你还没上火箭前就嫁给你
I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.

125
00:05:52,232 --> 00:05:54,962
但我过两天就要走了
But I'm leaving in two days.

126
00:05:54,972 --> 00:05:57,212
谷物麦片要买吗
What about Apple Jacks?!

127
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:01,452
我不用自备麦片粥好吗
I don't need to take cereal!

128
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,032
你以为你在俄罗斯
What kind of breakfast do you think

129
00:06:03,032 --> 00:06:05,302
他们会给你什么早饭吃啊
they're going to give you in Russia?!

130
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,822
他们发明了薄卷饼  饿不死我的
They invented blintzes! I'll be fine!

131
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,252
灯泡还是在纽泽西发明的呢
They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey!

132
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:16,312
去纽泽西也不会有人送你灯泡啊
It doesn't mean they hand them out to you when you go!

133
00:06:18,692 --> 00:06:20,962
我们就跟朋友们办个小仪式就好了
We'll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends,

134
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:24,062
等你回来了  还是可以再办盛大婚礼的
we'll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.

好呀  我们结婚吧

这样吧  给你买个高纤维的
You know what, I'll buy you All-Bran

137
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:38,292
免得你到时候在太空便秘
in case you get stopped up in outer space.

138
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,012
总之  我们决定今天下午
So anyway, we decided to go down to

-大家都能出席  -不行不行不行
- to come with us. - No, no, no,

144
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,552
这不是我想要的婚礼
this is not the wedding I wanted!

145
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:00,162
我要的是我穿着伴娘礼服
I want to wear my maid of honor dress

146
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:02,402
在万众瞩目下  步上红毯
and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me,

147
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:04,942
弦乐四重奏演奏着《今晚的你如此美丽》
while a string quartet plays "The way you look tonight."

148
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:07,772
我们没有要用这首歌啊
That wasn't going to be our processional music.

149
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,332
但我要用啊
Well, it was going to be mine!

150
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:14,072
谢谢你们的邀请  但我不去了
Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline

151
00:07:14,072 --> 00:07:16,682
因为感觉挺没意思的
because it doesn't sound like something I'll enjoy.

152
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,652
别这样  谢尔顿  会很有意思的
Come on, Sheldon, it'll be fun.

153
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:22,202
烂片《绿灯侠》你也说过有意思啊
That's what you said about The Green Lantern movie.

154
00:07:24,082 --> 00:07:27,072
你大错特错了足足114分钟
You were 114 minutes of wrong.

155
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:30,172
艾米  你的答案呢
So, what do you say, Amy?

156
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:33,302
我能穿伴娘礼服去吗
Can I wear my maid of honor dress?

157
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:35,412
拜托  你真想穿着那身衣服去市政厅啊
Seriously? You're going to wear that thing to City Hall?

158
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:37,722
我就剩这点指望了  连这你也要夺走吗
It's all I have left! You're going to take that from me, too?!

159
00:07:46,802 --> 00:07:48,922
-艾米  你真漂亮  -我知道
- Amy, you look great. - I know.

160
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,262
你上哪弄的啤酒
Where'd you get a beer?

161
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:57,222
从那边有纹身的小俩口那弄的
From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos.

162
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,722
可歌可泣啊  他们身处对立的贩毒团伙
Beautiful story: they're in rival drug gangs,

163
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:01,552
却要冒险来结婚
and they're getting married.

164
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:04,392
嘘  别让其他人知道
Shh, no one can know.

165
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,902
看看这些恋爱中的人
Look at all these people in love.

166
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,852
总会让你不禁思考  对吧
It kind of gets you thinking, doesn't it?

167
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,692
没错  确实
It does, indeed.

168
00:08:12,142 --> 00:08:13,572
莱纳德
Leonard...

169
00:08:13,572 --> 00:08:15,192
鉴于你最近向佩妮求婚了
is it awkward being here with Penny given that

170
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,272
跟她一起来是不是很尴尬
you recently proposed to her?

171
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:21,982
你向佩妮求婚了吗
You proposed to Penny?

172
00:08:21,982 --> 00:08:22,972
我不想讨论这件事
I don't want to talk about it.

173
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,232
他在哪求婚的
Where did he pop the question?

174
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,082
你怎么回答
What did you say?

175
00:08:25,082 --> 00:08:26,432
她不答应  能打住了么
She said, "no." Can we drop it now?

176
00:08:26,432 --> 00:08:27,982
那不算正式的求婚
It wasn't a real proposal.

177
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:29,552
为什么不算正式求婚
Why wasn't it a real proposal?

178
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,322
他在交媾的时候问的
He asked her during coitus.

179
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:36,702
你有单膝下跪吗  还是本来就这姿势了
Did you get down on one knee or where you already there?

180
00:08:39,302 --> 00:08:41,512
霍华德  婚礼的日子别这么说话
Howard, don't talk like that on your wedding day.

181
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:42,972
我错了  妈...  马...
Sorry, Ma... Bernadette.

182
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,872
我"马"上收声  我的伯纳黛特
Ma... Burna... You're ma Bernadette.

183
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:47,942
多亏你告诉了谢尔顿
Good move telling Sheldon.

184
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:50,512
怎么  不许我求婚  也不许我跟朋友说吗
What, I can't propose? I can't talk to my friends?

185
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:51,852
还有什么事是我不许做的啊
Is there anything else I'm not allowed to do?

186
00:08:51,852 --> 00:08:53,412
够了  别吵了
All right, that's enough.

187
00:08:53,982 --> 00:08:55,212
今天的主角不是你们俩
Today is not about you two.

188
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:58,402
今天的主角是霍华德和伯纳黛特
Today is about Howard and Bernadette

189
00:08:58,402 --> 00:08:59,652
还有我
and me.

190
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,232
各位请注意
Folks, can I have your attention.

191
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,342
现在已经五点了
It's five 0'clock ,

192
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,712
我们只能再注册三对新人
we're going to be able to take three more couples.

193
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,162
其他的人星期一再过来吧
The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.

194
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,452
不是吧
Oh, no.

195
00:09:09,452 --> 00:09:10,812
交给我
I got this.

196
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,042
不好意思
Excuse me?

197
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,512
能不能通融一下  让我们先注册
But is there any way you could squeeze us in?

198
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,522
其实  我是一名宇航员
See, I'm an astronaut and

199
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:21,332
我周日就要去俄罗斯
I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so

200
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:24,742
乘坐联盟号火箭上国际空间站了
I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.

201
00:09:24,742 --> 00:09:27,482
我也是呢  到时候见
Yeah, me, too. I'll see you there.

202
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,832
我不敢相信我们结不成婚了
I can't believe we're not going to get married.

203
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,532
失陪一下  我过去看看
Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple

204
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,322
排在前面的新人需不需要伴娘
at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.

205
00:09:44,426 --> 00:09:45,526
我跟我老婆说
So, I tell my wife,

206
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,726
"买狗  或者不买狗
"get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it,

207
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:50,316
我就在这里  我就不遛狗  不喂不清"
I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."

208
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,616
遛狗就是祸  是祸躲不过
You know you're going to wind up walking it.

209
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,956
我知道
I know.

210
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,526
你们不是该说些太空的事吗
Uh, shouldn't you guys be talking about

211
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:03,246
怎么说起狗来了
space stuff instead of dogs?

212
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:04,436
迪米特里
Dimitri,

213
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,536
果麦圈客说  我们谈谈
Froot Loops would be more comfortable

214
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:08,916
太空的事他会比较舒坦
if we talked about space stuff.

215
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:11,456
行啊
Okay,

216
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:13,036
我要去太空了
I'm going into space,

217
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:16,156
回来后  老子还得去捡狗屎
and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.

218
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:20,646
这样好点没
Is that better?

219
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:23,756
谢你们全家啊
Thanks.

220
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,236
其实我们可以开车去拉斯维加斯结婚啊
You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.

221
00:10:29,476 --> 00:10:31,546
那也太俗气老套了吧
No, it's that kind of tacky?

222
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:33,966
我就认识很多在那里结婚的人呢
Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.

223
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,666
有到现在还没离婚的吗
Are any of them still married?

224
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:38,646
有啊  配偶不是同一个罢了
Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but...

225
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:42,566
天下之大  一定有能让我们结婚的特别之地
There's got to be some place special we could do it.

226
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:46,536
莱纳德  你以前想象在哪跟佩妮结婚呢
Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?

227
00:10:48,686 --> 00:10:51,056
你别哪壶不开提哪壶
Will you shut up?

228
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,666
我知道怎么办比较特别
Well, I know how to make it special.

229
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:58,016
音乐之声  舞台剧/电影

230
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,356
我说过我们不模仿《音乐之声》
I told you we are not recreating the wedding

231
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,016
里面的婚礼
from The Sound of Music.

232
00:10:59,176 --> 00:11:01,536
我知道  你早残忍地跟我挑明了
Yes, you made that brutally clear to me.

233
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,276
我想建议的是
What I was going to suggest is

234
00:11:04,276 --> 00:11:06,926
如果你们愿意等到星期天早上结婚
if that you're willing to wait until Sunday morning,

235
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:09,646
谷歌的卫星会经过帕萨迪纳上空
the Google satellite will be over Pasadena.

236
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:12,796
卫星将会从太空拍下你们婚礼的照片
You can have your wedding photographed from space.

237
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,586
哇  酷毙了
Oh... That's so cool.

238
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,576
-挺有想法的嘛  拉杰  -我一直说
- Oh, way to go, Raj. - I keep telling you,

239
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:18,086
如果我没去当天体物理学家
if I wasn't an astrophysicist,

240
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,986
肯定会去当派对策划人
I would have been a party planner.

241
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:23,336
凡事都有两面性嘛
It was always a coin flip.

242
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:27,136
好  仪式的时间定在周日早上
Okay, so we know we're going to do it Sunday morning.

243
00:11:27,136 --> 00:11:31,096
现在得找一个卫星照得到我们的好位置
Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.

244
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:32,786
我们屋顶如何
How about our roof?

245
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:35,236
-我喜欢  -不错
- Oh, I like that. - That's great.

246
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,666
天啊  真不敢相信我的伴娘服
Oh, my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honor dress

247
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,686
要上谷歌地球的空照图了
is going to be on Google Earth.

248
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,336
地点和时间已经有了
So, we have the where and the when,

249
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,626
就差婚礼的证婚人了
but we still need to figure out who's going to do the ceremony.

250
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:48,106
那简单  谁都可以上网
Well, that's easy. Anyone can go online

251
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:49,596
受任当证婚牧师
and get ordained as a minister.

252
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:51,676
我知道一家刺青穿洞店  只要100块
I know a piercing parlor, where, for a hundred bucks,

253
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,036
他们就帮你证婚  你送你免费穿洞
they'll marry you and stick a wedding ring

254
00:11:53,036 --> 00:11:54,676
想把婚戒穿入哪部位都行
through any body part you want.

255
00:11:57,946 --> 00:11:59,956
不错  那谁来当证婚人呢
Great, well, who's it going to be?

256
00:11:59,956 --> 00:12:01,066
我来吧
I'll do it,

257
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:03,756
前提是得让用克林贡语主持仪式
provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.

258
00:12:05,406 --> 00:12:06,606
没门儿
No.

259
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,296
你是看上她哪点啊
What do you see in her?

260
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:15,006
指挥中心  请再说一次 漏的速度有多快

261
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,596
漏  什么漏了
Leaking? What's leaking?

262
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:20,306
当然是燃料啊  安静
Fuel. Shh.

263
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,546
还行

264
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,156
应该可以照常发射

265
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:27,386
收到  谢谢指挥中心

266
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,986
燃料在泄漏  我们还要照常发射啊
There's fuel leaking and we're still going to go?

267
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,426
别吓掉你的"圈子"[戒指]哦  果麦圈客
Don't lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.

268
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,166
这事经常发生
This happens a lot.

269
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,636
十次有九次都屁事没有
Nine times out of ten, no problem.

270
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:42,206
那第十次呢
What happens on the tenth time?

271
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:43,606
身后事
Problem.

272
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:49,166
伙计们  趁我还记得
Hey, guys, before I forget,

273
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,516
我给你们准备了伴郎小谢礼
I got you a little groomsman present.

274
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:52,896
-谢谢  -你太客气了
- Oh, thanks, man. - You didn't have to do that.

275
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:56,106
《神奇四侠》  1965年第三册

就是神奇先生和隐形女侠结婚的那集
The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.

278
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:04,876
哎哟喂
Oh, dear.

279
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,456
-我就害怕这样  -哪样
- I was afraid of this. - What?

280
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,336
虽然是很有心思的礼物
While a thoughtful gift,

281
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,286
但状态良好的这本漫画
this comic book in this condition

282
00:13:12,286 --> 00:13:14,576
现在至少值100块钱呢
is worth at least a hundred dollars.

283
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,676
是啊  然后呢
Yeah, so?

284
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:19,786
我送给你和贝纳黛特的船形调味壶才88块
I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth $88.

285
00:13:20,816 --> 00:13:22,946
这样就变成我欠你了
Which places me in your debt

286
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:24,916
而我不想欠你
and I can't be in your debt

287
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,016
因为哪天你可能会让我帮忙搬家
because someday you might ask me to help you move...

288
00:13:29,326 --> 00:13:32,576
...或帮你去杀人
...or to kill a man.

289
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:35,996
想杀人也不会找你帮吧
I doubt he'll ask you to kill a man.

290
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,436
万一他没得选了呢
Well, what if it's his only way out?

291
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,436
我不能冒这个险
I can't risk it.

292
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,856
这里是12块
Here is $12.

293
00:13:44,856 --> 00:13:46,076
现在不拖不欠了
Now, we're even.

294
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,796
慢着
Wait...

295
00:13:47,796 --> 00:13:49,916
我还有送卡片  退我2块钱
I bought a card. Give me two dollars.

296
00:13:53,486 --> 00:13:56,106
所以我说嘛  我最讨厌送礼了
And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.

297
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:01,806
谁呀
Who is it?

298
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,256
新郎
It's the groom.

299
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:06,626
你不能进来  婚前见新娘会倒霉的
You can't come in. Bad luck to see the bride.

300
00:14:08,796 --> 00:14:10,246
好吧
Okay, uh, fine.

301
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:12,666
妮妮  我得去接我妈
Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother!

302
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,286
马上就回来
I'll be right back!

303
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,566
她为什么不能自己开车过来
Why can't she drive herself?!

304
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,446
她不想坐皱她的裙子
She doesn't want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it

305
00:14:19,446 --> 00:14:23,636
得让她平躺在小面包车后座才能载过来
so I'm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbor's van!

306
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:26,236
好吧  快去快回
All right, just hurry!

307
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:28,706
收到  妈...  马...
Okay, I'll see you later, Ma... uh...

308
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,466
"马"上见哦  准新娘
lovely bride-to-be.

309
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:34,066
我真得好好注意下了
I really got to watch that.

310
00:14:40,526 --> 00:14:42,316
快点  拉杰  可以开始了
Come on, Raj, we're ready to start.

311
00:14:42,316 --> 00:14:43,786
什么  可不可以
What, we're ready,

312
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:46,106
得我说了才算
when I say we're ready.

313
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,876
好了  现在可以开始了
Okay, now we're ready.

314
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:57,156
妈  不坐过来怎么看得到啊
Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?!

315
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:58,946
坐这儿就挺好
I'm fine where I am!

316
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:01,186
我可不想从屋顶上摔下去
I don't want to fall off the roof!

317
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:05,886
在你摔下去前  屋顶早被你压穿了
You'll fall through the roof before you fall off it.

318
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:09,586
佩妮
Penny.

319
00:15:14,646 --> 00:15:17,706
你的新婆婆是个狠角色啊
Your new mother-in-law's a piece of work.

320
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,126
老爸  稍后再谈
Not now, Dad.

321
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:23,026
她的胡子比我的还"雄壮威武"
She's got a bigger mustache than me.

322
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,656
上吧  少年
Here you go.

323
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:31,146
什么"上吧  少年"  我又不是橄榄球
"Here you go"? What am I, a football?

324
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:41,176
他这废柴要真能接到橄榄球就好了
Like that guy could catch a football.

325
00:15:43,366 --> 00:15:44,746
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard and Bernadette,

326
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:47,546
今天我们作为你们的朋友兼牧师
the five of us stand before you as your friends

327
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,736
站在你们的面前
and newly ordained ministers.

328
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:51,406
大声点
Louder!

329
00:15:53,236 --> 00:15:56,306
他们都有牧师资格  要一起给我们证婚
They all got ordained, they're all marrying us,

330
00:15:56,306 --> 00:15:57,276
场面超有爱
it's adorable!

331
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:59,766
欲知详情  滚过来听
If you want to hear it, come closer!

332
00:16:02,846 --> 00:16:05,426
两位  当我看到你们
Guys, when I look at the two of you

333
00:16:05,426 --> 00:16:10,296
即将开始共度的人生旅程时  我心...
starting your lives together, it fills... my heart...

334
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:14,246
我心充满...
It fills my... heart...

335
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,576
我需要点时间平复一下
Okay, I'm going to need a minute.

336
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:19,516
还是我来致辞吧
Okay, I'll, I'll go.

337
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:22,006
霍华德与伯纳黛特  我知道
Howard and Bernadette, I know you two

338
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:24,766
这与你们计划的美妙婚宴大相径庭
planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding,

339
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:25,826
但只要彼此相爱
but when you're in love,

340
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:28,686
人间处处能成婚  形式不过锦上添花
it doesn't matter where or how these things happen.

341
00:16:28,686 --> 00:16:31,356
因为拥有对方  便拥有全世界
It just matters that you have each other.

342
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,366
有意见吗
Problem?

343
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:40,306
没有
No.

344
00:16:40,306 --> 00:16:44,456
我想牧师霍夫斯塔特是在讽刺
I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection

345
00:16:44,456 --> 00:16:47,656
你对爱情的看法以及
between your statement about love and your rejection

346
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:49,686
在你房里求婚被拒的事
of his proposal in the bedroom.

347
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:52,126
-少幼稚了你  -话又不是我说的
- Oh, grow up. - Hey, I didn't say it.

348
00:16:52,126 --> 00:16:53,086
够了  你们两个都收声
All right, that's enough from the both of you.

349
00:16:53,086 --> 00:16:53,916
他先挑事的
Well, he started it!

350
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,146
那我息事可以了吧
Well, I'm ending it!

351
00:16:58,786 --> 00:17:01,966
伯纳黛特  我想感谢你
Bernadette, I want to thank you

352
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:04,106
给我当你伴娘的机会
for allowing me to be your maid of honor.

353
00:17:04,536 --> 00:17:06,166
我也想告诉你
I also want you to know,

354
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:07,996
如果你们以离婚告终
that I will be happy to do it again

355
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:09,926
我也愿再当你的伴娘
if this marriage craps out.

356
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,736
谢谢致辞  艾米
Thank you, Amy.

357
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:19,556
"感人肺腑"啊
Very touching.

358
00:17:21,406 --> 00:17:23,196
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard and Bernadette,

359
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:26,616
能与最好的朋友彼此相爱  实乃三生有幸
you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other.

360
00:17:26,616 --> 00:17:28,956
这样的爱  情比金坚
And that's the strongest kind of love

361
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:32,586
因为你们的爱  充满着善意
because at its core, it has kindness,

362
00:17:32,586 --> 00:17:34,116
耐心与尊重
patience, and respect.

363
00:17:34,876 --> 00:17:39,106
这些优点在"某些人"身上偏寻不得啊
Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.

364
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,366
要来点芦荟修复精华吗
Would you like some aloe vera?

365
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,476
你被人虐得体无完肤啊
You just got burned.

366
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,206
好啦  轮到我了
All right, my turn.

367
00:17:53,716 --> 00:17:56,796
霍华德  伯纳黛特
Howard, Bernadette...

368
00:17:57,516 --> 00:18:00,716
[克林贡语]

369
00:18:00,716 --> 00:18:03,416
谢尔顿  说了不许用克林贡语
Sheldon! I told you no Klingon!

370
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:09,386
好吧  我用英语说
Fine, I'll do it in English,

371
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:11,176
但祝辞会略失风味
but it loses something.

372
00:18:12,836 --> 00:18:15,206
人穷尽一生追寻另一个人类
The need to find another human being

373
00:18:15,206 --> 00:18:16,986
共度一生的事
to share one's life with,

374
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:18,876
我一直无法理解
has always puzzled me.

375
00:18:20,606 --> 00:18:23,576
或许我自己太有意思  无需他人陪伴
Maybe because I'm so interesting all by myself.

376
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:28,506
所以  我祝你们在对方身上得到的快乐
With that being said, may you find as much happiness

377
00:18:28,506 --> 00:18:31,686
与我给自己的一样多
with each other as I find on my own.

378
00:18:32,706 --> 00:18:34,826
克林贡版本绝对能让你们痛哭流涕
The Klingon would have made you cry.

379
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:39,866
你们两个准备了婚誓吧
I believe you two have prepared vows?

380
00:18:43,986 --> 00:18:45,546
霍华德・约尔・沃罗威茨
Howard Joel Wolowitz,

381
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:48,866
我的婚誓如同你  短小但美妙
like you, this is going to be short and sweet.

382
00:18:50,606 --> 00:18:52,876
我全心全意  从灵魂深处爱着你
I love you with all my heart and soul

383
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:55,326
我愿一生一世  与你永不分离
and promise to be with you forever.

384
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:03,916
伯纳黛特・玛丽安・罗斯滕科斯基
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski...

385
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:05,556
大声点
Speak up!

386
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:06,596
喂  现在起
Hey, from now on,

387
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:08,736
能吼我的女人只有她一个
she's the only women who can yell at me!

388
00:19:13,746 --> 00:19:15,516
遇到你之前
Until I met you,

389
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:17,336
一生一爱
I couldn't imagine

390
00:19:17,336 --> 00:19:20,626
共度一生对我如同天方夜谭
spending my life with just one person...

391
00:19:21,576 --> 00:19:24,766
而现在
...and now I can't imagine

392
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:27,556
分离一刻  便有如生离死别
spending one day of it without you.

393
00:19:30,196 --> 00:19:34,286
以我们被加利福尼亚州所赋予的权利
By the power vested in us, by the state of California...

394
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:36,136
与克林贡最高议会
and the Klingon High Council...

395
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:42,296
我们现在宣布你们成为夫妻
...we now pronounce you husband and wife.

396
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:04,817
开始点火了
That's ignition.

397
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:06,687
我爱死这部分了
I love this part!

398
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:08,317
我也爱
Me, too!

399
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:11,437
我内心五味杂陈啊
I have strongly mixed feelings!

400
00:20:14,257 --> 00:20:16,107
天啊  要开始了
Oh, my God, it's happening.

401
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:17,157
我错过了吗
Did I miss it?

402
00:20:17,157 --> 00:20:18,727
没  快来看
No, come on in. Hurry.

403
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:22,827
他是我的挚爱
I love that man.

404
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,357
也是我的
Me, too.

405
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:31,307
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

406
00:20:31,307 --> 00:20:34,867
之前我心里总是对这事有小小的怀疑
This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.

407
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:41,737
时刻已到
This is it.

408
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:45,107
勇往直前吧  霍华德・沃罗威茨
Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.

409
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:52,707
亲娘咧
NOy vay...!
