1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,700
previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,300
Were you with a woman?

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,600
He cheated on you.
You said you were going to hate him forever.

4
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,300
You shouldn't listen to a woman
who's just had her heart broken.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,000
Sometimes ending a relationship...

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,400
I don't care what we call it.
I just want to be with you.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,800
I don't think that would be wise.

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,200
Can be very hard.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm the one who was sleeping with your son.

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
But, Helen, it's over now.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,200
But keeping secrets...

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,700
It's not even close to being over.

13
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,100
is even harder.

14
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.

15
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,000
I killed my baby sister.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000


17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Okay,30 seconds is up now.
I want you to put this --

18
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
whoa, whoa, whoa! Back here, back here!

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,700
Come back here! I want the toys picked up!

20
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,400
How many times do I have to tell you, pick up your toys!

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,700
You want a spanking? Okay!

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,700
There's a look that parents of well-behaved children
give to the parents of the not-so-well-behaved.

23
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,700
Porter, don't you dare look at me like that.
I will wipe that smirk off your face...

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,800
It's a look that says,
"you should learn to control your kids."

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,300
We're just going to clean the yard...

26
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,500
"After all, they're your responsibility."

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,300


28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,200
Hey! I'm not fooling!

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,100
Of course, it was easy for Susan to feel
smug with a daughter like Julie.

30
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,400
She always brought home straight A's.

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,100
Oh, you did it again!

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,700
She was helpful around the house.

33
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700


34
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,600
How you feeling?

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,900
She was bright, affectionate, and considerate of others.

36
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,400


37
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,800
To her mother's way of thinking,
Julie was the perfect child.

38
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:43,700
Unfortunately, Susan was about to discover
that no such creature existed.

39
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,000


40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,900
Mom.

41
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,800
What's going on here?
W-were you just kissing my daughter?

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,400
Uh, I -- a little.

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,100
What are you thinking?

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,800
Mom, calm down.

45
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,500
She's only 14!

46
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah, I should -- I should probably be going.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,500
You think?

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500


49
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh, just...

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,800
See you Friday.

51
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,200
Well -- what is he talking about?
What-- what's happening on Friday?

52
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,500
He's taking me to the school dance.

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,800
No, he's not.

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Mom, I know you saw us kissing,
but you've got to chill now.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,100
Well, don't tell me to chill.
I have no intention of chilling.

56
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,500
Whatever. I'm taking out the trash.

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,700
You're not going anywhere.
You're going to stay here and talk about this.

58
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm not going to talk to you while you're freaking out.

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,300
Just so we're clear, you are not
allowed to see him anymore.

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,000
There is also a look the parents of not-so-well-behaved
children give to parents like Susan.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,900
It says, "welcome to the club."

62
00:02:38,900 --> 00:03:14,700


63
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,900
Episode 13 : Your Fault

64
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,100


65
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:28,000
Suburbia is a place filled with responsible people
trying to live responsible lives.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,500


67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:36,300
Of course, even the most responsible among
us has mistakes in their past...

68
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,700


69
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,900
Mistakes they'd like to forget.

70
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,400


71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Mistakes that sometimes come back to haunt them.

72
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,200
I'm going to go get the mail.

73
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,600


74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Helen, uh, what are you doing here?

75
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,900
Hello, Gabrielle.
I don't believe you've met my husband Bob.

76
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,300
Hi. So nice to meet you.

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,700


78
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,400
Um... we, uh, came to talk to you about our son.

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,100
I haven't seen John in weeks.

80
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,300
He's called and left messages,
but I haven't returned any.

81
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
It's over, I swear.

82
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,600
We're not here about that.
We need you to do something for us.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,700
Oh. Okay.

84
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,000
John surprised us last night when he announced
he was turning down his college scholarship.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,900
Instead, he's decided to expand his gardening business
-- mow lawns full-time.

86
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,800
Well, why -- uh, why would he do that?

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,600
We don't know why.
Do you think we'd be talking to you if we did?

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,400
You'll have to forgive my wife.
She's still upset over the whole, um...

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Statutory rape thing.

90
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,500
Helen.

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,100
What do you want me to do?

92
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,700
He's refusing to talk to us.

93
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,300
If you could just convince him
that he's making a big mistake...

94
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,700
John and I made a clean break.
I think it's best that we just keep our distance.

95
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
Please.

96
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Last week he turned 18 and moved out of the house.

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,100
We're stuck.

98
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm -- I'm -- I'm so sorry.
I just can't handle this right now.

100
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,700
I  have my own personal things going on.
My life is falling apart.

101
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't care.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Helen.

103
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,500
We haven't gone to the police about what you did.

104
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
But that can easily change.

105
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,400


106
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,200
I'll see what I can do.

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200


108
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Good.

109
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,500


110
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,100
So  nice to meet you.

111
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,800
Ahem.

112
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,600


113
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,500
You can do this, all right?

114
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Just -- just scooch down a-a few inches and --
and I'll -- I'll grab you.

115
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
No, you'll drop me.

116
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not going to drop you.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,600
I might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place,
but drop you, no. Come on.

118
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,700


119
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey, okay, just wait, okay?

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,500
- Grandpa!
- Look at me. Don't come down.

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,400
Look who I found wandering around the airport.

122
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,100
Hey, Rodney!

123
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Is Parker back up on the roof?

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Yep.

125
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Yeah. See if he can find that frisbee while he's up there.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Yeah, I'm going to get right on that.

127
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,200
Oh, how's my favorite girl?

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,300
She's so happy to see you.
It's such a shame that Allison couldn't make it.

129
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,300
Oh, just another business trip
for the wandering salesman.

130
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,700
She'd be bored to tears.

131
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,600
Hey, Parker!
Come on. Aren't you going to give me a hug?

132
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,800
It's grandpa!

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,600
Don't take it personally.
He's scared to climb down.

134
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,900
Oh. Can I give it a shot?

135
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,300
Yeah, sure.
Knock yourself out.

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Yeah.

137
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,700
Be careful.

138
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,000
Parker, I got a question for you.
It's only one, but it's kind of an important question.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,800
A character-defining question, actually. Want to hear it?

140
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,200
Mm-hmm.

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Only a little girl would be afraid to come down the ladder.
Now, you're not a little girl, are you?

142
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:52,800


143
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm not looking at a little girly-girl, am I?

144
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,900


145
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,900
Are you okay?

146
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,600
Come on.

147
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,100
Wow, you got him down.
How'd he do that?

148
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,500
Sexism.

149
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,800


150
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Let's start off by addressing the division of assets.

151
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,900
Well, we're not prepared to discuss either the primary
residence or the retirement plans at this time.

152
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,000
Are you prepared to discuss the cars, the antiques?

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'd like to start by discussing
the country club membership.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,200
Access to the facilities is integral to
Dr. Van De Kamp's medical practice.

155
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
What are we doing here?

156
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,300


157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,400
Uh, I'm sorry, Rex?

158
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm talking to my wife,

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,100
surrounded by lawyers, dividing up our stuff.

160
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:39,400
I don't want this. I thought I did, but I don't.

161
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,400
Maybe we should talk this over before it's too late.

162
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
What do you say, Bree?

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,900
Should we send the vultures home?

164
00:07:48,900 --> 00:08:00,400


165
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
I want to keep the club membership.
Rex is terrible at tennis.

166
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
And he hates buffets.

167
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,500
Okay.

168
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,900
If you'll turn to page 2of the proposed settlement,
you'll find our prioritized list.

169
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,300
Right.

170
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,500
They were kissing, huh?

171
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,900
Right at my kitchen table.

172
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
You must have shocked the hell out of them.

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,000
Well, I'm glad you can laugh about this.

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
They're just being kids.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,400
This is easy for you. You're the father of the boy.

176
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,700
I'm the mother of the girl.
You know, if things get out of hand --

177
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,200
Yes, yes. I get it, Susan.

178
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
Now...what is it you want from me?

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,300


180
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,600
Well, I want to know that I am not the only one
who's worried about this,

181
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,100
and I want to know that if the two of the mare over here,
that they are going to be supervised,

182
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,800
and I really want you to stop looking at me like I'm crazy.

183
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,100
The only reason I'm smiling is because
it's practically irrelevant.

184
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
I've sold the house.

185
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
Really?

186
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,100
Mm-hmm.
We'll be moving at the end of the month.

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,900
You sold the house?

188
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,500
Zach.

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,900
Why didn't you tell me about this?

190
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,300
I wanted to wait until it was official.

191
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,900
You told me when I got back from Silver Crest
that you'd reconsidered. You lied to me.

192
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
I think you need to take your medicine.

193
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,100
What, you think pumping me full of drugs
is going to keep me quiet?

194
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,200
Upstairs now!

195
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Well, you don't care about me,
and you didn't care about mom!

196
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,900
You know what?

197
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,200
I wish she'd shot you instead.

198
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,100


199
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,800
So you're moving.

200
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,000
& nbsp;

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We're all going to miss you.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,200
In the future, checklists mean is it in the car,
not, like, do you remember it, okay?

203
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,300
The next morning, before Parker Scavo's
little league game had even begun...

204
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,200
- hurry!
- Hey! I'm not the one that forgot my mitt.

205
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,200
A major player was about to be tagged out.

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200


207
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,900
Hi.

208
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,000


209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I, uh... I thought you guys were at -- at practice.

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,700
Oh, Parker, um, forgot his catcher's mitt.

211
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,600


212
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,000
Uh, Lynette, this is Lois McDaniel.

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
She's one of my major supplier sin the area.

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She's in paper products manufacturing.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,900


216
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,500
It's nice to meet you.

217
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,800
Nice to meet you, too. You have a lovely home.

218
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
Thank you.

219
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,500
Just working out, uh, some of these new contracts.

220
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,900
You know, hammering out some of the little things,
the minor details --overhead, the shipping costs.

221
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,600
Mommy, look what I found.

222
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200


223
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm sorry. These are mine.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Thank you.
They must have fallen out of my purse.

225
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,700


226
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,200
Well, um, we don't want to be late for the game.

227
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,900
Nice to meet you.

228
00:10:50,900 --> 00:11:03,000


229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,900
Hey.

230
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm not speaking to you.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,300
Didn't like the settlement talks, huh?

232
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,900
You only demanded the good china
because you know I love it.

233
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,700
You take our timeshare in aspen, and I'm vindictive?
Come on. You'll hardly ever use that place.

234
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
Hardly?

235
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,600
- How about never?
- All right, fine.

236
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,600
When I move out, I'm going to use
your good china for takeout food.

237
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Yeah -- pizza, spare ribs...

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,100
Well, you know what? At our next settlement talks,
I plan on asking for your golf clubs.

239
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,800


240
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Isn't divorce fun?

241
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,700


242
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
It's time for your heart medication.

243
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,400


244
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,700
You know, I meant what I said at that meeting.

245
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,600
I will fire my lawyer tomorrow. Just give me the word.

246
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
Sweetie, I think it's too late.

247
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,700
Why?

248
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Because you were unfaithful.

249
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
But if you could find a way to forgive me,

250
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,000
if we could find a way to be happy,
wouldn't you want that?

251
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,500
You know what I really, truly want?

252
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,200
Revenge.

253
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,600


254
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,700
I mean, if somehow we could level the playing field,
then, um, maybe I could find a way to come back.

255
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,200


256
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,700
So what does that mean, you want to have an affair?

257
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,600


258
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Okay, uh... so who are we talking about here --
your dopey pharmacist?

259
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,200
Would that hurt you, Rex, if I slept with another man?

260
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,600
It would devastate me.

261
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,900


262
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,800
Here you go.

263
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,100
Bree, you --you can't possibly --

264
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,600
Rex, time to take your medicine.

265
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:54,800


266
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
I got it!

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:09,900


268
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,800
She doesn't hate you. My mom just worries.

269
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,200
She thinks I'm crazy.

270
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
No, she doesn't.

271
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
Well, maybe a little.

272
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
You didn't tell her what I told you, did you?

273
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
About what happened to Dana?

274
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,700
Zach, I can keep a secret.

275
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,700
I promise I will never tell her.

276
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,000
What's that noise?

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:14:00,800


278
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,500
Hi. W-what are you doing here?

279
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,100
I was walking outside, and I saw you in the window.

280
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,400
I was surprised. I never thought
of you as a diner person.

281
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm not. The coffee's just dreadful, and --

282
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,500
Well, it's late, and I needed to get out of the house,
and it was the only place still open.

283
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
Yeah.

284
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,200


285
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,400
I didn't mean to interrupt.

286
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,700


287
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,500
George?

288
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500


289
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:36,600
Would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?

290
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,000


291
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,300
It was my first week in college, and I went to a meeting
of the young republicans where Rex gave a speech,

292
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,500
and I went up to him afterward and introduced myself

293
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,100
and told him that I agreed with
his stance on the death penalty.

294
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,700
He took me out to a diner, and, uh...

295
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:05,300
We stayed uptill 2:00 in the morning talking about big
government, gun control... and illegal immigration.

296
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,300
Oh, it was just -- t was just such a magical night,

297
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:20,500
and I knew by the time he got me back to my dorm hat
one day, I was going to be Mrs. Rex Van De Kamp.

298
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,400
Wow.

299
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,000


300
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,900
And  even now, you know, after the betrayal, I --
I know that we're supposed to be together, but...

301
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,600
I don't know how I can be with someone I don't trust.

302
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,800
So...what are you going to do?

303
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800


304
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,600
That I don't know.

305
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,300
What do you think I should do?

306
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,100
You're asking me?

307
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,500
Oh, I should not have done that. I'm --

308
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,300
Oh, no, no. No, it's okay.

309
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,900
No, George, it's not okay. It was insensitive.

310
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,700
I know how you feel about me, and I --

311
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,100
No, Bree, I --I want to help.

312
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,000


313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,300
Thank you.

314
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,000


315
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,700
So...does he love you?

316
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,500


317
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes.

318
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,700
Is he a good person?

319
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,000
Aside from the adultery, yes.

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,700
Well, then it's easy.

321
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,000
If I could get a good person to love me,
would find a way to forgive them.

322
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,900


323
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,500
You are such a special man, George Williams.

324
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,000
And you deserve such a special woman.

325
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,100
I think so.

326
00:16:40,100 --> 00:17:30,500


327
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,800
Where are you going?

328
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I thought I'd just eat this in my room.

329
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:39,200
You know, the house isn't that big, Rodney.
You're going to have to stop avoiding me.

330
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:39,400


331
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,300
Okay, okay.

332
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,500
Lois isn't a supplier.

333
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,400
Really.

334
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
And I want to apologize.

335
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,000
I-I thought you and the kids ere
going to be gone all afternoon.

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,500
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?

337
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Well, for starters, you can wipe that
disgusting smirk off your face.

338
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,700
Lynette.

339
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,100
How could you do something like this to Allison?

340
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know. I don't know.
It happens a little bit at a time.

341
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Years go by, the kids burn you out,
I'm on the road so much.

342
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,500
We just drifted apart. It's complicated.

343
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,200
It's not complicated. It's completely irresponsible.

344
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,800
For years, I have stayed married to a woman that
I don't love because I made a vow to god.

345
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,200
So don't talk to me about responsibilities.

346
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,700
So your take on this is you're the victim?

347
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, I can see that we're just going to
have to agree to disagree.

348
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,500
We're not done here.

349
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,400
Oh, yeah, we are, cause my sex life
is my own business, not yours,

350
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,800
and there's nothing you can do about it anyway.

351
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:53,800


352
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,400
Dad?

353
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,700
What are you doing?

354
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't want to talk about it.

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,700
Talk about what? Does Lynette know you're out here?

356
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,500
Oh, yeah, she knows.

357
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,900
Will you drive me to the airport?

358
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Wait here.

359
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey, Lynette.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Yeah?

361
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Why is my dad sitting out on the curb?

362
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
Because I kicked him out of the house.

363
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,800
I-I see. You want to tell me why?

364
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,500
Hold on.

365
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,700
I made you a drink.

366
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,300
Oh, god. What did he do?

367
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,400


368
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,700
Yesterday, I came home, and I walked in
on your dad with a woman.

369
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,100
He's having an affair. I am so, so sorry.

370
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,700
God.

371
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,400
I know, I know. Are you okay?

372
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,500
Yeah. Um, I should go talk to him.

373
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
That's it?

374
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,400
What?

375
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,800
I just --I expected a bigger reaction.
I've been sitting herewith knots in my stomach.

376
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,100
Okay, look, I never mentioned this before because
I knew how you'd react, but, um...

377
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm not that surprised by this.

378
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,300
My father's been having affairs for years.

379
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300


380
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,500
You knew about this?

381
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,300
Yeah. Kind of, yeah.

382
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,100
I mean, I mean, it was mostly in the past.
I mean, I didn't know that he was still at it.

383
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,500
I mean, I figured he was getting too old.

384
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
In some strange way, I'm actually impressed, you know?

385
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,000
Impressed?

386
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,300
Impressed? I --

387
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,000
Tom, please, please don't tell me
you're all right with this.

388
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm not. No, no.
He should never have brought that woman over here.

389
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,100
No, he should never have been with her in the first place.

390
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,000
I know, I know.
But, you know, that's who he is.

391
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,800
I mean, it's been going on for years.
My mom's made peace with it.

392
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,500
I seriously doubt that.

393
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,800
Look, you know, there's no point in talking about this,

394
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
but I'm going to go get my father,
I'm going to bring him back in here,

395
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,300
I'm going to put him in his room,
and we can all just cool off.

396
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,000
That man is not coming back in this house.

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes, he is.

398
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
No, he's not.

399
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,400
Lynette, he is my father, this is my house.
You can't tell me what to do.

400
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,700


401
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,800
I say we go up there and kick the door down.

402
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Yeah, dad, you do that.
Let me knowhow that works out for you.

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000


404
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,800
Hi, um...

405
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,400


406
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,900
I don't know if I have the right address.

407
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,200
Does John Rowland live here?

408
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,600
I'm really glad you came by.
I was going to call you again tomorrow.

409
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,100


410
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,400
Uh, yeah, I'm --
I'm sorry I haven't returned any of your calls.

411
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,300
It's okay. I'm just happy to see you.

412
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,600
I heard about Mr. Solis.

413
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,500
It sucks you had to take a job.

414
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,900
Yeah, well, you know me --
I'll survive.

415
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,900


416
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,700
Come here.

417
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:51,800


418
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,500
Oh, no, John.

419
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I, uh...I didn't come here for that.

420
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,800
What's wrong?

421
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,900
Well, I heard that you're going full-time
with your gardening business.

422
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:01,700
What happened to college?

423
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,800
I decided not to go.

424
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,900
Why?

425
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:09,500
Well, an opportunity has presented itself,
and for me to take advantage of it,

426
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,900
I need to start making money.

427
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:17,000
John, what opportunity is more important than college?

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
For the longest time, the only thing
I had to offer you was my heart,

429
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,200
and Mr. Solis gave you security, and I couldn't compete.

430
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
You know, but now, he can't even
offer you that, and I can.

431
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,300
My business is taking off. I can take care of you.

432
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,100
We can finally be together.

433
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,500


434
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,200
Mrs. Solis...

435
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,100


436
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,300
will you marry me?

437
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,300


438
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,400
Please. Why else would you want
to chaperone the dance?

439
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,800
Mrs. Van De Kamp needed volunteers.

440
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,000
She begged me.

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're so transparent.

442
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,500
Anyway, you won't even know I'm there.

443
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,200
Well, not too much.

444
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,700
Julie, you know you can tell me anything, right?

445
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,000
Yeah, mom.

446
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,700
So if you had a problem or some sort of
secret was weighing on you...

447
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,400
Of course.

448
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,100
I'd tell you everything.

449
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,900


450
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,400
You know, I can't believe you're
just uprooting us like this.

451
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,500
We need a fresh start.

452
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,100
Here.

453
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,800
You want to get it about like this.

454
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,700
So many bad things have happened around here.

455
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,000
Finally I have someone I can talk to.

456
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,700
It's like you want to take that away.

457
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,000
You mean Julie?

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,300
Yeah.

459
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,000
What bad things do you talk to her about?

460
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,400
Do you talk to her about your mother?

461
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,500
Yeah.

462
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,800
And other stuff.

463
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,200
Like what?

464
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,500
Zach. Like what?

465
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Dad...

466
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,800
This is what I've been trying to talk to you about.

467
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,100
Okay...

468
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:11,700
Ever since mom died, I've --I've started to remember things, just quick flashes from when I was little.

469
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,100
Nice and taut like this.

470
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,500
What kind of things?

471
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,200


472
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,500
Lots of blood...

473
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,300
mom screaming...

474
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
and Dana.

475
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,900


476
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,300
I remember killing Dana.

477
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,800


478
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,400
You told this to Julie?

479
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,700
I trust her.

480
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,900
Did she tell her mother?

481
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,400
I don't know.

482
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000


483
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
Start from the beginning.

484
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,000
I want you to tell me everything that you told Julie.

485
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:08,500


486
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,300
Hey.

487
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,700
Hey. What's that?

488
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,400
Uh, well, I was going to give it to you,

489
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,300
but I saw that the other girls weren't wearing flowers,
so I guess it's not that kind of dance.

490
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,500
If you don't want to stand out, I'd understand.

491
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,700
I like standing out.

492
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:50,200


493
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
What's Paul doing here?

494
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,300
Oh, he's chaperoning.
He called a couple of hours ago and volunteered.

495
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Really?

496
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,400
Why? What's wrong?

497
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,200
Well, the other day, he could have cared less
about Julie and Zach dating,

498
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,700
and now, all of a sudden, he shows up at the dance?

499
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,000
Maybe he's just trying to be supportive.

500
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,500
Maybe.

501
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:15,600


502
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,100
Dr. Van De Kamp.

503
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,900
Hello, George.
My cardiologist phoned in a prescription.

504
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,700
Oh, right, right.
I've got it here somewhere.

505
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,800


506
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,000
So have you seen Bree lately?

507
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,300
Yeah, I ran into her last night at the dineron
maple avenue. We had a nice talk.

508
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,700
Mm.

509
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,700
That's all you did --just talk?

510
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,100
We're just friends, Dr. Van De Kamp -- nothing more.

511
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,200
That's good to hear.

512
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,100
You know, if you ever do get a vibe from Bree that
she's interested in more than just friendship,

513
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,000
I'd be careful if I were you.

514
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,700
Excuse me?

515
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,900
I just want you to know that she'd only be using
you to even the score with me.

516
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,500
Don't fall for it.

517
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,700
Bree would never do anything like that.
She's a lady.

518
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,300
Exactly. A very beautiful, classy lady.

519
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,300
Remember, they tend to end up
with doctors, not pharmacists.

520
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,900


521
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,500
Bree is very beautiful and very classy,
but she's not very perceptive.

522
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,700
For instance, she thinks you're a good person,
and it's now very clear to me

523
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,400
you aren't.

524
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,700


525
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,900
I'd like my prescription now, George.

526
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,300


527
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,900
- R. VAN DE KAMP -

528
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,800


529
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,900
I can't seem to find it.

530
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,600
Guess I'll have to have it delivered.

531
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,300
Thank you.

532
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,100
No. Thank you.

533
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:41,700


534
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,800
Paul.

535
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,700
Did you notice? They're playing a classic.

536
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,300


537
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,100
Yeah.

538
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
Care to dance?

539
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,100


540
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,100
I'd love to.

541
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:07,000


542
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,400
I have a little confession to make.

543
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,600
Oh?

544
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:16,300
I have been so concerned about Julie lately that
I sort of eavesdropped on her the other day

545
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,400
while she was having a phone conversation with Zach.

546
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,700
Really.

547
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,800
They were having a very interesting conversation.

548
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
About?

549
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,100
Zach was telling Julie about what happened to Dana.

550
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,800
Was he now?

551
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes.

552
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,300


553
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,300
How much did you hear?

554
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,000
Everything.

555
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,200


556
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,200
You realize it was an accident.

557
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,700
Oh, of course. I assumed as much.

558
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,100
He didn't mean to kill Dana.

559
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,800


560
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,000
He was practically a baby himself.

561
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
He didn't understand what he was doing.

562
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,600
No, of course he didn't.

563
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,900
So what happened exactly?

564
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,300
Mary Alice and in ever really knew.

565
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,700
We heard the baby screaming.

566
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,100
By the time we got up to the crib, it was too late.

567
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,800
Paul, I am so sorry.

568
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Thank you.

569
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,500


570
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,900
So you and Mary Alice just kept this
to yourselves all these years?

571
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,700
It was a very dark chapter in our lives.

572
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,000
We preferred not to relive it.

573
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,300
It was also a private family matter.

574
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,100
I'd appreciate your discretion.

575
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:52,500


576
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,900
Sure.

577
00:30:54,900 --> 00:31:12,700


578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,800
Look...

579
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,100
I want you to know that I'm really sorry I talked to Julie,

580
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,100
but she did promise me that she wasn't
going to say anything to her mom.

581
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,400
It's okay. I handled Susan.

582
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,100
Good.

583
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,200
But we need to talk about these things
that you think you remember.

584
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,300
They're not true.

585
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,900
How can they not be true?

586
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,400
Memories lie, Zach.

587
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,000


588
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,700
You didn't kill anyone.

589
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,700


590
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,500
Dana is very much alive.

591
00:31:50,500 --> 00:32:05,300


592
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
Hi. What are you doing here?

593
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,200
Where is it?

594
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,600
- What?
- The ring, Gabrielle. My grandmother's ring.

595
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,200
John caught me off-guard.
Obviously, I'm going to give back the ring.

596
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,700
Well, you better, because make no mistake,
if you try to ruin my son's life,

597
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,300
I will ruin yours.

598
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,400
Helen, okay. Go to the car.

599
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,800
Come on, please.
Just -- please.

600
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,300


601
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:37,600
Obviously, I'm not leaving my husband
and marrying John.

602
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,900
Well, I think that's wise.

603
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
I-I'll talk to John tomorrow and give back the ring.

604
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,200
Okay, good, good.
Um, we appreciate everything you've done.

605
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,600
Hey, Bob.

606
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I get why she's so angry with me, but what
I don't get is why you're so nice.

607
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,200
Well, John's a big boy.

608
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,600
Whatever happened between the two of you
is his mistake as much as yours.

609
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,800
I guess.

610
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,500
I understand if, uh, if you hate me just a little.

611
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:20,300


612
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,700
When I was a kid, I always played by the rules.

613
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:30,500
I never cheated on a test, never even missed a curfew.

614
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,400
But I can't help but think...

615
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:39,800
how wonderful it would have been to have made
at least one mistake like you.

616
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,400


617
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
That's sweet. You're -- you're very sweet.

618
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,800
Yeah. I'm a little sweet.

619
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,700


620
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,000
Mostly I'm just middle-aged.

621
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:05,300


622
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,600
- SOLD -

623
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,700


624
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,600
Are you okay?

625
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,200
I know this is a lotto digest all at once.

626
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,900
I'm fine.

627
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:22,600
I'm just happy you finally told me the truth.

628
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,600


629
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,100
One thing, though -- why are you telling me all this now?

630
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,800
I couldn't let you keep thinking that you killed someone.

631
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
No one should carry that kind of burden.

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,200
Or you just didn't want me running my mouth.

633
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,300
That's not what it's about.

634
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes, it is.

635
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,300


636
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,600
I won't tell anyone.

637
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,300
I'll keep your secret.

638
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300


639
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,200
Dad.

640
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,900
Thank you.

641
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,300
But we're not moving.

642
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,700
That's out of the question.

643
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,300


644
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,100
Well, I'm not leaving Julie, and if you
want my support, that's the deal.

645
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,000
And if I refuse?

646
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,700
You won't.

647
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:23,300


648
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,100
So here's the thing --

649
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,700
I feel really awful about how I acted before.

650
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,300
For god's sake, Lynette, you threw
me out of my own house.

651
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,300
I overreacted, I know. I'm sorry.

652
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,800
Look...

653
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,800
I know you love my mom, but how she decides to live
her life, it's just --it's entirely up to her.

654
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,600
You're right. You're right.

655
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,000


656
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,700
I guess I just got so upset because... oh, whatever.

657
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,800
Let's not beat a dead horse. It's over.
I'm sorry. Good night.

658
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,100


659
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,900
Okay, get it off your chest.

660
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,200
Well, you knew your dad was having an affair,
and it didn't seem to bother you that much,

661
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,200
and that worries me, because if you can find it
in you to condone something like that,

662
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,800
then what's going to happen when you've
been on the road for 40 years?

663
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,300
Lynette...

664
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm not my father.

665
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,700
I know. Of course.

666
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,500
You're not your father.

667
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,500


668
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,100
And just so we're absolutely clear,
I am definitely not your mother,

669
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,700
because if you ever betray me, I will leave you.

670
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:45,800
I will take the kids, and I will walk out that door,
and you will never see any of us again.

671
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,000


672
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,100
Whoo. Glad to get that off my chest.
Thank you. I love you.

673
00:36:51,100 --> 00:37:00,200


674
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,300
Couldn't sleep, huh?

675
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,400
No.

676
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,300
Me either.

677
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,600


678
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,900
I'm so sorry about the ruckus I caused.

679
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,600
It's okay. I'm not, uh...

680
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm not upset about that.

681
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,200
No?

682
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,500
No.

683
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,200


684
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,200
What's wrong?

685
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,900


686
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,600
There's something that Lynette doesn't know about,
dad -- something that I did.

687
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,800
And I don't know what's going to happen
if she ever finds out.

688
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000


689
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,700
The next morning, Gabrielle returned the
engagement ring to her former lover,

690
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,800
a gesture that was met with... measured enthusiasm.

691
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,200
Please, calm down.

692
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
This doesn't make any sense, okay?
You love me. I know you love me.

693
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,000
Love isn't enough.

694
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Where would we live --here, with your roommates?

695
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,800
The only decoration in the bathroom is a bong.

696
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
We could get our own place.

697
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
How? You're barely making minimum wage.

698
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,100
Okay, sure, we'd be poor at first, but we'd be happy.

699
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,900
I've tried poor but happy.
Guess what --it wasn't that happy.

700
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:05,200
Mr. Solis is going to jail.
You want to stick around for that?

701
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,600
I don't know.

702
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,200
You know, every once in a while,
even I want to do the right thing.

703
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,700
Mrs. Solis, I love you so much.

704
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,100
I mean, doesn't that mean anything to you?

705
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,400


706
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,100
Honestly, no.

707
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,500
John, you're a toy -- a sweet, dumb toy,

708
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:34,100
so you might as well go to college,
because you and me -- no future.

709
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:41,100


710
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,800
Ms. Mayer, hey. Is Julie home?

711
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,500
She's in the shower.

712
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,800
Oh.

713
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Well, I just came by to give her some good news.

714
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,900
What's that?

715
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,500
Well, it turns out that my dad
and I aren't moving after all.

716
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,400
What?

717
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah, he reconsidered, so I guess
we're going to keep living across the street.

718
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,400
Okay.

719
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,700
Wow, uh... wow.

720
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:11,300
You know, uh, c-can you sit down?
I-I need to talk to you.

721
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,900


722
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,200
Hey.

723
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,600


724
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Do you know that Julie is the first girl
I ever gave a flower to?

725
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,800
Really?

726
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,200
Yeah.

727
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,300
Yeah, I-I really like her, Ms. Mayer.

728
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
Zach, um...

729
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:34,600


730
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,900
Julie is only 14 years old,

731
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,800
and sometimes girls, when they're that age,
they just don't always make the right decisions,

732
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:50,100
and, um... as her mother, it is
my responsibility to protect her.

733
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,800
You want to protect her from me?

734
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
No, I-I just --

735
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,700
I think that you should slow things down.

736
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:05,000
I-I want you to not see her for a while.

737
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
No.

738
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
"No"?

739
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,900
You're not taking her away from me.

740
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,100


741
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,600
Listen, I know being dramatic is the birth
right of every teenager, but come on.

742
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Why are you laughing?!

743
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,700
Do you think this is funny?

744
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,300


745
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:24,500
Thank you, Zach.
You have just made this really easy for me.

746
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,900
You are now forbidden from seeing or
talking to my daughter ever again,

747
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,500
and if you come within 10 feet of her, I will call the police,
and I will have you arrested. Now get out.

748
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:59,900


749
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:07,600
Sooner or later, the time comes when we
all must become responsible adults

750
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600


751
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:15,800
and learn to give up what we want so
we can choose to do what is right.

752
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,400


753
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,800
Of course, a life time of responsibility isn't always easy.

754
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:30,000


755
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,800
And as the years go on, it's a burden
that can become too heavy for some to bear.

756
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,800
But still, we try to do what is best, what is good --
not only for ourselves...

757
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,800
but for those we love.

758
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,700


759
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,000
Hey.

760
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,400
I'm glad you came.

761
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,000
Zach, I can't stay long.
If my mom catches me, she'll freak.

762
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,200
Come here.

763
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,100


764
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,600
She said I can't see you anymore.

765
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,300
What are we going to do?

766
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,800
I'm not sure.

767
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,300


768
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,500
Yes, sooner or later,
we must all become responsible adults.

769
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,000
No one knows this better than the young.

770
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:41,000
