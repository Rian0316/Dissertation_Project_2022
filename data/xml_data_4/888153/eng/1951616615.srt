52
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,042

53

<i>once the decorations
came out.</i>

60
00:03:35,035 --> 00:03:38,595
<i>for some, that meant
pulling out the colored lights.</i>

61
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,425
<i>for others, it meant
locating that holiday wreath.</i>

62
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,186
<i>and then there were those</i>

63
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,473
<i>eager to display
their nativity scene.</i>

64
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,521
<i>but for a romantic few,</i>

65
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,794

(chuckles)
mmm.

69
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:04,978
while you're in
a good mood,

70
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:06,943
i thought
i'd spring something on you.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,041
my parents
are coming to town.
your parents? really?

72
00:04:10,105 --> 00:04:11,239
and i wondered
if you might be free

73
00:04:11,312 --> 00:04:12,886
to join us
for dinner saturday.

74
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:19,380
absolutely. uh, so i assume
this means they know about me?
but of course.

75
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:20,795
and they know
about me as in...

76
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,036
(british accent)
"mum, dad, bloody good ns.

77
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:25,786
i've got melf
a smashing new girlfriend."
(laughs) that's adorable.

78
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,601
please don't do it
in front of them.
(normal voice) right.

79
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,905
so, um, do you want me

80
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:34,624
<i>to make reservations
at that little french place?
we--we could do that,</i>

81
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:36,520
but it's a--
it's a 4-hour layover

82
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,431
and they're
going to be exhausted,

83
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,432
and i thought we might have
a more enjoyable time

84
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,759
if they came here and--and you
made dinner for them.

85
00:04:44,432 --> 00:04:47,822
okay, i guess it's time
we have the conversation.

86
00:04:50,109 --> 00:04:51,310
ian...

87
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:55,224
haven't you ever wondered
why i've never cooked for you?

88
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,516
?????

89
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,859
no, i wish.

90
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:03,794
my cooking...
is not good.

91
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,797
well, my parents won't
be expecting a gourmet meal.

92
00:05:06,854 --> 00:05:08,719
will they be expecting
stomach cramps,

93
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,997
acid reflux, night sweats?

94
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,910
(laughs) come on,
you can't be that bad.

95
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:20,745
<i>oh. oh,
it is really important</i>

96
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,711
that i make them
a home-cooked meal?

97
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,307
well, it's just that

98
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:26,603
they're very old-fashioned
hearth-and-home types,

99
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:29,284
and they might wonder why--
why you didn't make the effort.

100
00:05:30,507 --> 00:05:33,212
oh, but it's okay. you--you--
you'll win them over...

101
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,058
eventually.

102
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:40,129
okay, i'll give it a shot.
(laughs)

103
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,081
thank you.

104
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:44,671
now nothing elaborate.

105
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:46,288
just a simple roast
and, uh,

106
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:49,070
and something appropriate
to go with it.
right...

107
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,792
like an ambulance.

108
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:52,879

109
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:02,126
<i>no, amy, small steps.

00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,542

112
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,053
getting there, sweetie.

113
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:09,846
(under breath)
if she was a horse,

114
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:11,162
we'd have to shoot her.

115
00:06:12,723 --> 00:06:15,107
(under breath) poor thing,
she tries so hard.

116
00:06:15,164 --> 00:06:18,667
(normal voice) yeah, she's
a trooper. let's dump her.
(normal voice) what?! why?

117
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,722
pageant consultants are judged
on the strength of their roster.

118
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:22,945
you know,
we can't afford to bounce

119
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,418
every nose-picking
no-talent,

120
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:25,466
but we can definitely lose
the one

121
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,058
who's dragging us down,
and that's amy.

122
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:30,666
(under breath) we can't do that!
her mother died last year.
yes, i know, i know,

123
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:32,968
and it's tragic,
but we are running a business.

124
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,720
amy is sucking up
all of our time,

125
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,376
and we should be
focusing on sherri.

126
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,928
she actually has
a shot at winning.

127
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,567
how will i tell her family?
we'll do it together.
we'll be very diplomatic.

128
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:44,592
are you sure about this?

129
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:48,638
the poor kid's been through
the wringer and--
amy! for god sakes,

130
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,086
little miss snowflake
does not scratch down there!

131
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,501
(sighs)
well, then again,
her mother died a year ago.

132
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:55,651
how long
is she gonna milk it?

133
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,288
ahh... mother hodge,
i have your breakfast.

134
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,624
just put it over there.
i'll pick through it later.

we also have cable.

142

you're gonna do about orson?

143
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,483
decided?
yes. have you
called a lawyer yet?

144
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,723
i don't think
that's any of your concern.

i don't mean to pry,

146
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,115
but i think
you're a good christian woman,

147
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,547
and you deserve better
than my son.

148
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:40,202
well, i will take that

i saw those pictures.

173
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:52,330
those boys
were on his swim team.

174
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:53,705
he was proud of them.

175
00:08:54,352 --> 00:08:56,017
turning that
into something dirty

176
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,681
says more about you
than him.

177
00:08:57,873 --> 00:09:00,640
you can defend him all you want.
i know what i know.

178
00:09:00,727 --> 00:09:03,704
ar engine starts)

179
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:07,559
did you know
my brother got spit on

180
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,543
athe hardware store
yesterday,

181
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,302
that they refused
to serve us at the diner,

182
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:17,724
that our tire got slashed
at the church parking lot?

183
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:18,293
(exhales deeply)

184
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:24,804
i am not a well woman.
i don't need this stress.

185
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,651
well...
i am sorry that happened.

186
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:33,369
have you considered
even for a moment

187
00:09:33,394 --> 00:09:34,937
that you could be wrong,

188
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,790
that you misinterpreted
what you saw,

189
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:40,911
<i>that you are ruining
my brother's life and mine</i>

190
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,534
over nothing?

191
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,701
i have kids, okay?

192
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:48,942
better safe than sorry.

193
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,355
so i'm cooking dinner

194
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:08,836
for ian's parents
tomorrow night,

195
00:10:08,893 --> 00:10:10,203
and it's the first time
i'm meeting them,

196
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:14,467
so i sort of
wanna impress them.
and yet you're cooking?!

197
00:10:14,802 --> 00:10:15,849
well, that's the thing.

198
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:19,546
uh, so i was hoping--you know,
if you're not too busy...

199
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,505
oh, no, no, these things
practically build themselves.

200
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:25,184
thank you.
you are a lifesaver.

201
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,188
actually...

202
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:29,360
i could probably use
the distraction.

203
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,302
oh?

204
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:36,071
(sighs) i asked orson
to move out last night.

205
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,141
oh, come on! why would you
bury your toolbox in the woods?

206
00:10:42,197 --> 00:10:45,037
i knew the cops were
looking for it, and i panicked.

207
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,710
i was just trying
to buy myself me time.

208
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:50,125
well, you may have
bought yourself 20 to life!
oh, let the guy
enjoy his breakfast.

209
00:10:50,181 --> 00:10:51,413
stay out of this, carlos.

210
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:54,044
mike, i want you
to look at me.

211
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,619
yeah, you look me in the eye
and you swear to me

212
00:10:56,701 --> 00:10:58,194
that you
didn't kill anybody.

213
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:01,235
how many times do i have
to tell you? i can't remember.

214
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:03,443
<i>you can't remember,
or you don't wanna remember?</i>

215
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,149
um, guys.

216
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:20,153
bree, you have got to go
to the police with all of this.

217
00:11:20,273 --> 00:11:23,249
i can't. not yet.
i-i need some time to think.

218
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,888
his wife goes missing,
then his mistress turns up dead.

219
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:27,294
what is there
to think about?

220
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:27,935
(bree sighs)

221
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:33,559
i know it sounds suspicious,
but in my heart of hearts,

222
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:36,070
i just can't believe that
orson could do such a thing.

223
00:11:36,103 --> 00:11:37,557
sweetie,
we all wanna believe

224
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,181
the best of the people
we care about,

225
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,270
but you cannot
let your feelings for a man

226
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:43,093
blind you
to cold hard facts.

227
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,980
what in the world?

228
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:52,882
oh, my god!

229
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:57,755
what's going on?

230
00:11:57,906 --> 00:11:59,779
they just arrested mike
for murder.

231
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,234
what?!

232
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,258
they're saying he killed
that woman othe news,

233
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:04,585
that monique person.

234
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,088
oh, thank god!

235
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,647
i can't believe we're gonna
break that little girl's heart.
do not
wimp out on me here.

236
00:12:14,744 --> 00:12:16,088
we gotta do
what's best for the business.

237
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:18,696
what if the father
yells at me?
then i will jump in
and defend you.

238
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:20,959
okay, but if you do,
try and be diplomatic.

239
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:22,199
i'm always diplomatic.

240
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,495
now just get in there,
you spineless 'mo.

241
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:27,926
excuse me, mr. pearce?

242
00:12:30,046 --> 00:12:31,677
i'm so glad
you could come today.

243
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:33,221
this is
my partner gabrielle.

244
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:36,876
pleasure to meet you.

245
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,524
(laughs)

246
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:39,492
(vern) shall we?

247
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:44,715
so, uh, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

248
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:45,835
is there a problem
with amy?

249
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,587
not a problem, per se.

250
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,041
we're just
a little concerned

251
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,457
that she might not
have the, um...

252
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,847
temperament
for pageant competitions.
and what does that mean?

253
00:12:54,881 --> 00:12:56,961
well, when it comes
to performing,

254
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,768
she's not exactly...

255
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:04,533
well, she tends to be--
feel free to jump in.

256
00:13:05,113 --> 00:13:07,033
i have no idea
where you're going with this.

257
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,943
well,
as gaby and i discussed,

258
00:13:13,798 --> 00:13:15,454
amy has certain limitations

259
00:13:15,526 --> 00:13:16,863
and her odds of winning
are slim.

260
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:17,951
vern!

261
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,046
(scoffs)
he is so competitive.

262
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,557
i constantly have to remind him
they're just kids. (chuckles)

263
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:26,757
when did you lose the joy?
oh, i think you know.

264
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,261
wait, i'm--i'm confused.
are you--are you dumping amy?

265
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,922
of course not, bill.

266
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:33,649
can i call you bill?

267
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:35,150
(chuckles) it's just,

268
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:38,416
we feel that amy would benefit
from some private coaching.

269
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:40,070
maybe i could
come to your house?

270
00:13:40,168 --> 00:13:41,735
say, friday, 5:00?

271
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,095
sure.
(laughs) yeah, i guess.

272
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,000
great! it's a date.
(laughs)

273
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,038
maybe i should come, too.

274
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:53,870
after the harsh things
you said about amy?

275
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,126
i don't think so. (laughs)

276
00:13:58,736 --> 00:13:59,876
i'm gonna need
a good lawyer

277
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,001
and that may take
a lile research.
uh-huh.

278
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,895
and whoever takes my case
will need a retainer,

279
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:07,409
so if you don't mind,
i promise i'll pay you back.

280
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:11,997
oh, okay.
and makeure
he knows about my wrench.

281
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:16,160
apparently, they tested it ??????

282
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:19,661
what's wrong?

283
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,124
i don't know if you
picked up on this, mike,

284
00:14:24,164 --> 00:14:26,860
but...
i haven't been happy.

285
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:31,107
no, i didn't
pick up on it.

286
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,776
well, i wanted
to tell you this weeks ago

287
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:34,598
and i wish that i had,
because now i know

288
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,173
you're gonna think that
i'm breaking up with you

289
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,052
over this whole
blood on the ax thing.
wrench.

290
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,645
whatever. but believe me,
that's not it.

291
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:45,891
it's jus..

292
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,571
we are moving too fast.

293
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,539
what are you trying to say?

294
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,178
well, may--maybe
we should just... take a break.

295
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,833
you know...
date other people.

296
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:01,334
you're telling me this

297
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:03,525
on the day
i'm put in a men's prison?

298
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,189
well,
i said the timing was bad.

299
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:12,887
i am sorry.
i... i really am.

300
00:15:13,534 --> 00:15:16,019
(whispers)
i just can't do this.

301
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:32,826
they told me
somebody was coming,

302
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,905
but i did not expect it
to be you.

303
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:37,769
is edie
getting you a good lawyer?

304
00:15:38,969 --> 00:15:41,721
(chuckles) i doubt it.
she dumped me today.

305
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,712
what? why?

306
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,895
<i>well,
i was arrested for murder.</i>

307
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:47,528
still...

308
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,743
it's tacky.

309
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,152
(chuckles)

310
00:15:52,303 --> 00:15:54,102
well, okay then, uh...

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,604
i-i'll help get you out.

312
00:15:57,341 --> 00:15:59,580
uh... what's your bail?

313
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,513
a million dollars.

314
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:07,215
oh. (laughs)

315
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:09,536
you don't
have to help me, susan.

316
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,144
i want to.

317
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,831
aren't you gonna ask?

318
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:21,752
what?

319
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,238
if i killed that woman?

320
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:28,781
i don't have to.
i know you didn't.

321
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,949
i wish i was that sure.

322
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:42,715
i... i have these flashes
where i see her face,

323
00:16:42,739 --> 00:16:43,963
so i must've known her.

324
00:16:44,635 --> 00:16:46,012
and if i did,
maybe something happened.

325
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:47,610
maybe i got angry, maybe--

326
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,426
there's an explanation f this,
and we're gonna figure it out.

327
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,137
n't worry about a thing.

328
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:05,632
miss gabrielle!

329
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,671
when are you gonna
come outside and watch me?

330
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:10,840
oh, um, the grass, honey,
and my allergies...

331
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:13,350
go ahead and practice.
i'll watch you from here.

332
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,926
are you sure
i can't help with anything?

333
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,162
ah, i've been a single dad
for a while now.

334
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:24,472
i got
the nner thing down.
mmm, i've got
the restaurant thing down.

335
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,809
i can't bring myself
to cook for one.

336
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:29,104
not that i ever
cooked for two. (chuckles)

337
00:17:30,024 --> 00:17:33,576
well, no restaurant tonight.
you are having dinner with us.

338
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,288
oh, that's sweet.

339
00:17:35,313 --> 00:17:37,833
it's the least i can do
to thank you for helping amy.

340
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,824
oh. it's nothing.

341
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:47,765
yeah,
she's a special girl.

342
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,876
so...

343
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,284
how is it for you,
being single again?

344
00:17:55,212 --> 00:17:58,276
oh, honestly? um...
mm-hmm.

345
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,162
i hate it. it's like
i've forgotten how to date.

346
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,798
me, too. you know,
i even let a friend of mine

347
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:06,652
talk me into one of
those speed dating things.
how was it?

348
00:18:06,741 --> 00:18:08,514
mmm, i didn't even go in.

349
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,226
i just sat
in this hotel lobby.

350
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,970
i watched all these

351
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:13,610
lonely, desperate
single people filing in,

352
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:16,106
and then it hit me--
i'm one of them.

353
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:18,633
i know what you mean.

354
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,144
did you see that?

355
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,160
it spun three times
and then i caught it.

356
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,687
um...

357
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:27,913
you didn't see.

358
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:30,991
yeah, i-i'm sorry, sweetie.
i-i was distracting gabrielle.

359
00:18:31,064 --> 00:18:32,927
oh, no, no,
it's totally my fault.

360
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:35,613
i'm sorry, sweetie.
go outside and do it again.

361
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:37,303
i promise this time
we're gonna watch.

362
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,535
(knock on door)

363
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:55,715
come in.

364
00:18:56,147 --> 00:18:56,346
(door closes)

365
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:00,323
hey. wow, oh,
those are gorgeous.

366
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,340
well, i, uh, i figured
you'd be too busy cooking

367
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,658
to manage a centerpiece.

368
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:08,378
well, you, uh,
you may not be a good cook

369
00:19:08,401 --> 00:19:10,313
but you're--
you're certainly a tidy one.

370
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,537
don't worry.
dinner's all taken care of.

371
00:19:12,561 --> 00:19:13,705
we're having...

372
00:19:13,977 --> 00:19:16,804
<i>blanquette de veau
and a grand marnier soufflé.</i>

373
00:19:16,844 --> 00:19:18,518
well, that's
very ambitious of you,

374
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,061
and, uh, when will bree
be done making it?

375
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:23,117
5:30. (chuckles)

376
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,580
but i am rewarming it
all by myself.

377
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,352
oh, what's, uh,
what's all this?

378
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,018
um, mike was
arrest for murder.

379
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,500
my god.
i-i mean, of course
he's totally innocent.

380
00:19:35,548 --> 00:19:37,395
i'm just trying
to help him find a lawyer.

381
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,739
oh. shouldn't, um, shouldn't
his girlfriend be doing that?

382
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:43,241
yeah. edie dumped him.

383
00:19:43,738 --> 00:19:44,657
hmm.

384
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:51,610
okay, i know how this looks,
but i just feel bad.

385
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:54,239
he's just a friend now.

386
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,817
(sighs) yes. yes, a friend
you sat by for six months,

387
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:00,079
hoping he'd wake up
and ravish you again.

388
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:04,143
<i>you are the only one
allowed to ravish me these days,</i>

389
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,382
so stop worrying.

390
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,988
(lowered voice) orson,
it's me again. please call.

391
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,612
we need to talk.

392
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:16,972
(sighs)

393
00:20:19,707 --> 00:20:20,855
i'll do the chips.
you deal.

394
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:22,188
you got it.

395
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:27,467
guys, why has it been so long
since we've played poker?

396
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:28,585
i really need this.

397
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:30,808
oh, me, too.
there's nothing more relaxing

398
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:33,455
than an afternoon
of finger food and girl talk.

399
00:20:33,561 --> 00:20:36,553
hi, ladies!
(lynette)
hey! how you doing?

400
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:38,784
(sighs) so did you
tell the police

401
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:40,631
that you think
orson killed monique?

402
00:20:40,691 --> 00:20:41,711
what?!

403
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,191
no, i did not,
and i don't plan to.
but mike is in jail,

404
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,461
and you said yourself
you thought orson did it.

405
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:49,599
i said i had concerns,

406
00:20:49,637 --> 00:20:53,437
concerns that have disappeared
now that mike has been arrested.

407
00:20:53,494 --> 00:20:55,613
what are you saying?
you think mike is guilty?

408
00:20:55,653 --> 00:20:57,389
hey, why don't we start
that girl talk?

409
00:20:57,468 --> 00:21:00,333
i'll get the ball rolling.
anybody have a yeastnfection?

410
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,316
they found monique's blood
on the wrench

411
00:21:03,356 --> 00:21:05,268
that mike
was trying to dispose of.

412
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:09,306
<i>i mean, that hardly screams
innocence.
her teeth were pulled.</i>

413
00:21:09,388 --> 00:21:11,066
you don't think
that's worth telling the cops

414
00:21:11,227 --> 00:21:13,169
<i>she was messing around
with a dentist?</i>

415
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:15,322
orson was slipping it
to the dead chick?

416
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:18,145
mike is innocent.
i know that in my heart.

417
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,657
we all have
convictions, susan.

418
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,057
i believe mike's last one
was for manslaughter.

419
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:24,872
okay, okay, we've all made
some excellent points

420
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:26,664
and blown off
a little steam.

421
00:21:26,687 --> 00:21:28,816
whoo!
let's play some cards.

422
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,430
if you're so sure
that orson is innocent,

423
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:35,998
why don't we go through
his things? where's his desk?
at his office.

424
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:38,630
and what did you think
you'd find there anyway?
i don't know.

425
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:41,558
a blackmail letter,
a necklace made of teeth?

426
00:21:41,581 --> 00:21:44,213
we're not gonna play cards,
are we?
nope.

427
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,076
well, i am certainly not
playing with a woman

428
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,508
that is willing to let mike take
the fall for her psycho husband.
well, needless to say,

429
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:53,827
i won't be cooking dinner
for ian's parents.
fine. i'll cook myself.

430
00:21:53,908 --> 00:21:56,659
good. let me know
if there are any survivors.

431
00:21:56,709 --> 00:21:59,433
and if you take orson back,
you do the same.

432
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:00,378
(exhales deeply)

433
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,800
(bree) well, that was
incredibly awkward.

434
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,000
i'm sorry you both
had to sit through it.

435
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
was it me?
was i out of line?

436
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,100
hey, come on in.
you're just in time.

437
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,300
thanks so much, rita.

438
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,400
i think
it's such a good idea

439
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
that we all get together
and talk and...

440
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>wow. wow.
what is all this?</i>

441
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,500
oh, we decided
to stage a protest

442
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,900
in front of art's house.

443
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
a protest?
mm-hmm.

444
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,700
rita, i want the word
"pedophile" to really stand out.

445
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,100
do we have any glitter?

446
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
say "molester."
it sounds scarier.

447
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,400
i'm sorry.

448
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,300
i-i-i thought we were
all gonna talk about

449
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,500
how to keep an eye
on this guy.

450
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
we're past talking.
the guy's a menace.

451
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,800
well, that's what we think,
but we don't exactly have proof.

452
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,200
the youth center just fired him.
how much proof to you need?

453
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,600
but, see,
the only reason they fired him

454
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,400
is because
people were gossiping,

455
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
and the only reason
they're gossipg

456
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,700
is because
of what i told mrs. mccluskey.

457
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,300
yeah, and you told me
to spread the word.

458
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,600
so--so that people could watch
their kids and be vigilant.

459
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,500
so you wanna wait

460
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,600
until he actually molests
one of our kids?

461
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,200
whose side are you on,
lynette?
knock it off, gert.

462
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
remember,
if it weren't for lynette,

463
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
we never would've found out
about this cre.

464
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,000
she's our hero.

465
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,900
(door opens)

466
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,900
(door closes)

467
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,900
(susan sighs)

468
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>(man) ...the 22-yard line,
the give is to harrison,</i>

469
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,200
<i>who is hit immediately
and dropped for a loss</i>

470
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,100
<i>in his own backfield...</i>

471
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,400
(amy) bye-bye, daddy.

472
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
(bill) see you, sweetie.
have fun. mwah.

473
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,400
so i was, uh,
i was thinking you--

474
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,400
you wanna grab a cup of coffee
or something after class?

475
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,900
i'd love to grab
a cup of coffee...

476
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,300
or something. (laughs)

477
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,300
(sighs) amy, you are so lucky
to have such a nice dad.

478
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,000
yeah, i know.

479
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,800
leave him alone.

480
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,700
excuse me?

481
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,800
you heard me.
i don't want you dating him.

482
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,600
oh, sweetheart.

483
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,200
i have a feeling
i know what this is about.

484
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,100
no u don"t

485
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,600
i think you do 

486
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,000
miss your mommy,
and it feels funny

487
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,800
seeing your daddy
be nice to somebody else.

488
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,100
but believe me, i'm not trying
to replace your mom.

489
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,700
well, i am,

490
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,300
and i have someone
all picked out.

491
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,400
what?

492
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,600
i want my dad
to marry sherri's mom.

493
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,600
sherri from class?

494
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,700
we're best friends,
and we have it all planned out.

495
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,300
our parents
are gonna get married,

496
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,300
and then
we'll be real sisters.
what about your dad?

497
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,700
???

498
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,100
my mom died.

499
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,000
all my dad wants
is for me to be happy.

500
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,000
now get in there and teach me
how to work the runway.

501
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,900
that's what
we're paying you for, right?

502
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
<i>(man) ...runs it left,
swings it around.</i>

503
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,300
<i>he fights his way to the 25
for another first down,</i>

504
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,800
<i>and that should
just about do it.</i>

505
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>i tell you, with 1:12
left on the clock</i>

506
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,900
<i>and no time-outs remaining...</i>

507
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,300
(turns off television)

508
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
(orson sighs)

509
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,900
(bree) orson?

510
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,300
(orson) bree?

511
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,100
orson. why haven't you
returned any of my calls?

512
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,700
i was afraid you were calling
to ask me for a divorce.

513
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
(sighs) no, i wasn't.

514
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
they arrested mike

515
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,000
for the murder
of monique polier.

516
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,700
they did?
the other night,

517
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
you wanted a chance
to explain everything.

518
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,700
well, here it is,
and i want it all.

519
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
if i find out
you've left anything out,

520
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,700
then i will ask
for that divorce.

521
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,000
okay.

522
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,000
(sighs)

523
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
<i>you're working
so hard, sherri.</i>

524
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,100
you must really wanna
win this pageant.

525
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,900
more than anything.

526
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,600
aw. well, i think dedication
should be rewarded,

527
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,600
so i have
a little surprise for you.

528
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,400
what is it?

529
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,500
well, you know how the pageant starts with
a big opening number?

530
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,300
this year, all the contestants
are gonna dance in pairs,

531
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,200
and i've arranged

532
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,400
for yoto dance with
your best friend amy!

533
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
what's wrong, sweetie?

534
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,500
well...

535
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
amy sucks.

536
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,700
well, i thought you two
were practically sisters?

537
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,800
we are...
but she still sucks.

538
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,400
and first impressions
are everything.

539
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
you said so yourself.

540
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,300
well, that's true--
and this is
the opening number.

541
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,400
if the judges see me
tripping all over that klutz,

542
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,000
there's no way
i'm gonna win.

543
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,400
that's a good point.
now i wish i hadn't told amy.

544
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,600
you already told her?!

545
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,100
she was so excited.

546
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,700
(sighs)

547
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,400
well,
she's your best friend.

548
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,000
why don't you just tell her
the truth? she'll understand.

549
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,600
what if she doesn't?

550
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
well, friends come and go...

551
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,500
but a crown is forever.

552
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,600
i never loved alma.

553
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,000
my mother
pushed us together,

554
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,300
and... i was stupid enough
to get her pregnant.

555
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,600
you had a child?

556
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,000
alma miscarried
a month after the wedding.

557
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,500
i was trapped.

558
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,300
well,
you could've left her.

559
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,200
mother wouldn't hear of it.

560
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,700
divorce is a sin.

561
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,900
so i stayedin the marriage,

562
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,800
hoping i would come to feel
what i was supposed to,

563
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,100
but i never did.

564
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,400
so i resigned myself
to a life without love.

565
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,300
and then i met monique.

566
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,600
it was wrong. i didn't care.

567
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,000
i loved her more than
i'd loved anyone...

568
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
till you.

569
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,000
so why couldn't you
tell me this?

570
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,600
because you told me
about rex,

571
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,800
how he cheated on you,
how hurt you were.

572
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,100
bree, i needed you
to feel safe with me.

573
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
(bree) well, you haven't done
a very good job.

574
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,700
handling the truth would have
been a hundred times easier

575
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:12,000
than dealing with
all the doubt and suspicion.

576
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,300
(orson speaking indistinctly)

577
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,300
so you stayed in a loveless
marriage because of your mother?

578
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,100
i know how it sounds.

579
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,800
but after my father died,
she s all i had.

580
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,800
his death caused me
so much pain.

581
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,900
(orson speaking indistinctly)

582
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
i would've
done anything for her.

583
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,200
(bree speaks indistinctly)

584
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,400
(orson speaks indistinctly)

585
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,800
she saw that weakness,
and she ran with it.

586
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,200
(orson speaking indistinctly)

587
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
you--you've got no idea
how manipulative she can be.

588
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,900
she ruins lives.

589
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,100
now i've told you
everything.

590
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,000
what happens now?

591
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,200
well...

592
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,000
first you pack up your things
and come home,

593
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,400
and then...

594
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,500
we toss your mother out
on her evil ass.

595
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,800
god, i love you.

596
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,700
hi!
i'm sorry i'm late.

597
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,000
where are your folks?

598
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,900
they're not coming.

599
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
their plane was snowed in
at o'hare.

600
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,800
oh. well, that's too bad.
well, no harm done then, huh?

601
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,200
you're 40 minutes late.

602
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,200
but they're not here.
you didn't know that.
and where's dinner?

603
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,700
uh... bree and i
sort of had a fight.

604
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,000
um... look, i'm awfuy sorry
that i'm late.

605
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,500
i-i had an emergency.

606
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,700
did this emergency
have anything to do with mike?

607
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
i'm pretty sure
that bree's husband

608
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,500
murdered the woman
the cops think mike killed.

609
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,700
i went to his office--

610
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,500
oh, for god sakes, susan.

611
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,600
no, no,
i found evidence. look.

612
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,100
orson was committed
to a mental institution

613
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,600
for over a year.

614
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,700
i mean, doesn't that suggest
he's some sort of--
i don't care!

615
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,000
tonight meant a great deal
to me, and you blew it off.

616
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,000
i said i was sorryian.

617
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,300
i have to help mike.
i'm all he's got.

618
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
actually, you're wrong.
he's got me.

619
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,500
what?

620
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,300
tomorrow, i'll hire the best
lawyer in town to defend him,

621
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,800
and i'll pay
every cent of his bill.

622
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,800
you would do that for mike?

623
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,800
yes, on one condition...

624
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,900
you can't see him anymore.

625
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,200
why?

626
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
if you start visiting him,
being a friend to him,

627
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,800
he'll fall in love
with you again.

628
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,300
then you'll have to decide whose
heart to break, his or mine.

629
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,000
as jealous ultimatums go,
that's very flattering,

630
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
but i don't think
that's necessary.

631
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,100
mike and i are done.

632
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,500
then you should have no problem
accepting my generous offer.

633
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,900
you would really get him
the best lawyer in town?

634
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
an absolute piranha.

635
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,700
do we have a deal?

636
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,600
well, okay then.

637
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,400
you know,
mike barely remembers me.

638
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,100
what makes you so sure

639
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,800
he would fall in love
with me again?

640
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,500
what a perfectly asinine
question.

641
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,800
how could he not?

642
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:23,100
(all shouting at once)

643
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,200
(shouting continues)

644
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,300
god, i was only
in the house 15 minutes.

645
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,700
are there more of them now?

646
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
yep.

647
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
(shouting continues)

648
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,100
go ahead, say it.
i know you want to.

649
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,300
this is all your fault.
you should've listened to me.

650
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,000
i know, but be fair.

651
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,100
there is no way
i could've anticipated this.

652
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,600
you tell people
frankenstein's on the loose,

653
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,600
<i>then you're surprised to see
the torch-wielding villagers?</i>

654
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,300
i'm putting the kids
to bed early.

655
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,800
i don't want 'em
to see this.

656
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,200
(siren wailing)
is that an ambulance?

657
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,200
(amy) i can't believe
you're doing this!

658
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,600
???

659
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,400
god, i hate you!
i hate you!

660
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
don't ever talk to me again!

661
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,300
hi. bill?

662
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,500
i was wondering, do you
have plans saturday night?

663
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,800
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

664
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,700
excuse me. i'm sorry.

665
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,000
what--excuse me, can you--
can you tell me what happened?

666
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,300
ma'am, i need you
to step back.
okay.

667
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
we're brinng in
a female, late 30s.

668
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,800
and get crash ca ready.
she's in cardiac arrest.

669
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,900
there he is.
there he is.

670
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,800
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

671
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,700
(all shouting at once)

672
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,200
stop it! stop it!
you can't do this to people!

673
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,100
have you lost your minds?!

674
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,700
well, excuse us for wanting
to feel safe in our own homes.

675
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,500
well, that's my home,

676
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,800
and i don't feel
very safe right now.

677
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,700
please, please, all of you,
just leave this street.

678
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,500
please, i beg of you. go!
just get off my street, please!

679
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,000
wait, wait!
art, wait, i'm sor--

680
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,500
(shouting continues)

681
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
i'm sorry.

682
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,600
you're an idiot
to take him back.

683
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,600
i am no longer interested
in your opinion.

684
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
i thought
i made that clear.

i should thank you.

714
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,200
my sister was...

715
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,000
a really wonderful person.

716
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
she always saw
the best in me.

717
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,300
but there were things
she couldn't see...

718
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,100
or chose not to,
god love her.

719
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,200

720
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,300
i think you know.

721
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,300

722
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,800
that i had
to take care of rebecca,

723
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,500
so i could never
let myself...

724
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,200
slip and do something
that would hurt her.

725
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,500

726
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,900
