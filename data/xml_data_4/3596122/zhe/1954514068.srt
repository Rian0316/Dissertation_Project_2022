连钱都可能携带性病病毒的
There's a good chance even the dollars have herpes.

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,420
如果那些单身钱都有性病
Well, if those singles have herpes,

9
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,950
那他们应该把病情隐瞒到结婚之日
They should just lie about it till they get married

10
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,750
就像所有人一样
Like everybody else does.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,270
朋友 我们在这蛋糕窗口

而且还是在旁边家破餐厅辛苦工作
and that is after eight hours of slinging hash

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,810
八小时后 就赚那么点点的钱
at the diner next door for lousy minimum wage,

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,150
可是那群有钱的政客 身处... 帮帮我

就她说的那地方... 不给我们涨薪
What she said... don't wanna raise.

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,120
然后我们还得走回自己的非法单间
Then, we walk home to our illegal one bedroom apartment,

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,490
靠着吃感冒药才能睡上三小时
get three hours of nyquil induced sleep

26
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,660
之后起床 我们只能分食一碗

所以 我不会把这血汗钱给你
So, no, I am not about to give you our hard-earned money.

30
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,010
如果你要开枪打我 最好瞄准点
And if you're gonna shoot me, better aim good.

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,180
否则 如果你失手了 我就会翻出这个柜台
'cause if you miss, I will climb over this counter,

32
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,310
揪下你的脑袋 用来做新的小费瓫
tear off your head, and it'll be our new tip jar.

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,990

克兰布斯店倒闭关门的 太吓人了

就像是一个连环杀手在追杀
It's like there's a serial killer out there

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
纸杯蛋糕

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,140
那他应该很容易逃脱

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,970
因为有个胖胖的嗜血法医

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,410
我不是去搞基 我只是关心餐厅发展

我都担心得睡不着觉了
I already lie awake in bed

75
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,870
担心食物堆积得过高
worrying about how high the food bar is here.

76
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,850
端菜! 手撕猪肉
Pick up! Pulled pork.

77
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,200
这道菜味道会很好 因为我在撕之前
And it's good 'cause before I pulled it,

78
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:44,460
因为我已经给它做了个干擦
I gave it a dry rub.

79
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,380
新菜是标价四美元的土司
It's $4 toast.

$4 toast?

比我们现在的土司还贵五美元
That's $5 more than our toast is worth.

At first, I was reluctant to put something so big in my mouth.

84

但是当那热呼呼的奶油顺着我的下巴流下
But the hot butter drizzling down my chin

85

00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,740
Han 这个土司太前卫了
Han, that toast is trendy foodie food.

87
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,240
它会死在这里的 正如我的灵魂
It'll die here, like my soul did.

88
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,510
我们的顾客都是些庸人 凡人
Our customers are just plain, normal people.

抱歉 我孩子是尼日利亚人

要想住在这里 就得学英语

152
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,300

156
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,920
上帝终于为我们开了一扇门

157
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,640
所以我要关一扇窗
And I'm closing a window.

给我一个理由 
Just give me one good reason

164
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,820
为什么不和卡戴珊姐妹同行
why we shouldn't keep up with the Kardashians.

165

她们的妈妈真大胆 竟然给一个也许
That mother has some nerve, naming a kid

173
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,380
从未看过Kindle电子书的孩子起这名字
who's probably never even read a book "Kindle."

174
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,970
我们需要这个机会
We need this.

175
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,190
所有人都看"与卡戴珊姐妹同行"

177
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,970
"与星共舞"
but without the stars.

178
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,730

181
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,300
这个秀讲的是一个家庭
Well, it's all about this family

182
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,240
他们努力地想要...
and their struggle to...

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,740
同行

Max把我们的旧电视给炸了
Max turned our old one into a bong.

188
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,100

"金买了新帽子"
"Kim gets a new hat."

191
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,940
还是"克莱在科切拉音乐节痛哭"?
Or "Kylie cries at Coachella"?

192
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,860
还是"克洛伊来了次比基尼蜜蜡脱毛"?
Or "Khloe gets a bikini wax"?

193
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,310

196
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,520
卧室里那个录了53集

197
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,740
我喜欢听着金的声音入睡
I like to go to sleep with the sound of Kim's voice.

198
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,960
她说这句话的时候太怡人了
It's so comforting when she says,

199
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,660
"真是超级尴尬的"
"this is super awkward."

200
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,000
要知道她有时候会弯下腰
And you know, sometimes she arches her back

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,470
做这个动作说
when she says it, like this.

202
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,470
"真是超级尴尬的"
"This is super awkward."

203

我打赌如果我留在波兰
You know, I bet you if I stayed in Poland,

205
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,400
我和姐妹们也会有自己的真人秀
my sisters and I would have had our own show.

206
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,940
名字就是"与卡金斯基姐妹同行"
It would've been called, Keeping Up with the Kachinskis.

207
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,110
可惜她们没活到20岁就死了
It's too bad we all didn't live to see 20.

208
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,450
真不好
It's not cute.

209
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,330
你知道我想有人能逗笑我
You know I need someone to make me laugh.

210
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,620
金在哪儿? 她老是迟到
Where's Kim? Kim is always late.

211
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,790

就这样 结束了 给钱吧
That's it, we're done. Money.

214
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,380
嘿 你们出去! 都早上了!
Hey, get the hell out! It's morning!

215
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,680
我知道 但是看着她们无所事事
I know, I know, but we couldn't stop

216
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,690
让我们看上瘾了
watching them do nothing.

217
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,310
这真人秀太厉害了!
This show is freaking genius!

218
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,190
金发妹子是在哭吗?
Is the blonde one crying?

219
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,640
恩 克丽斯和金在维也纳的时候
Mm-hmm. Kris and Kim are in Vienna

220
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,310
有人偷了克丽斯的宝缇嘉定制包
and someone stole Kris's Bottega bag

221
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,700
香奈儿手包 以及她在巴黎买的
and her Chanel clutch with the matching pumps

222
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,400
配套高跟鞋
that she bought in Paris.

223
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,040
好吧 我要去吃早晨醒神药了
All right, well, I have to go take my morning tinkle.

224
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,830
但我回来的时候 你们必须得走
But when I come back, I want you two to be out of here

225
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:49,480
因为我需要那个秋千做运动
because I need that swing for my exercises.

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,050
我们必须参与这个真人秀
We have to do this show.

227
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
对我们的生意很有好处
It'll be so great for our business.

228
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,670
否则要想得到同样的曝光度
The only way we'd get more exposure

229
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,010
除非是奥兰多·布鲁姆和贾斯汀·比伯
is if Orlando Bloom and Bieber bitchslapped each other

230
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,760
在我们店门口对扇耳光
in front of our shop.

231
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:05,430
谁还管我们的生意呀?
Who cares about our business?

232
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,770
我要那妈收养我!
I want that mother to adopt me!

233
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,360
她家小孩拍了个性爱录像带 她能用它赚了几百万
Her kid makes a sex tape, she turns it into millions.

234
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,580
我拍了个性爱录像带 我妈竟然只是
The only thing my mother ever did with my sex tape

235

241
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,100
我什么都不会说的
I won't have to say anything.

242
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,890
克丽斯看到我的嘴唇和大胸
Kris will see me and recognize me

243
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,940
以及我想住富人区的念想
as one of her own with my lips, my boobs,

244
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,810
就会觉得我是她亲生的
and my willingness to live in some place called Calabasas.

245
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,730
他们来了 我的人生要改变了!

她们不来了
They're not coming.

251

穿高跟鞋走过来太远了
It's too far to walk in heels.

252
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,830
看看 她也许真的是我亲妈
See? She might as well have been my real mom

253
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,790
因为她选了高跟鞋而不要我
'cause she just chose a heel over me.

254
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,630
嗨 我是来见我的闺蜜金金的

看看我的新裙子! 和她同款的!

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,510
抱歉 她不来了
Sorry, she's not coming.

259
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,100
噢
Oh.

260
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,650
这真是超级尴尬的
Well, this is super awkward.

261
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,210
愚蠢的卡戴珊姐妹!
Stupid Kardashians!

262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,000
金 大脚踝 臭脾气
Kim, Kankels, Krank,

263
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,430
小的那俩叫"性爱运动"和"儿童足球"

264
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,390
才不屑你们拍马屁呢
You can kiss my keister.

265
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,890
Max 停下! 我想睡觉
Max, stop it! I'm trying to sleep.

266

抱歉 但我很生气 反正也11点半了
Well, sorry, but I'm pissed and it's 11:30 anyway.

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,780
你怎么了?
What's going on?

268
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,900
金哪怕发一条状态 她那两千两百万的
Even one tweet from Kim would have exposed us

269
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,270
粉丝就会知道我们了
to 22 million followers.

270
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,700
基督教科学派都没那么多教众
Scientology doesn't even have those numbers.

271
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,900
我们被耍了 我就知道
They screwed us. I know.

272
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,240
所以我在为卡戴珊姐妹
That is why I'm making hate cupcakes

273
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,740
做恶意满满纸杯蛋糕 瞧
for the Kardashians, see?

274
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,630
"吃屎" "去死"
"Eat it," "Bite me,"

275
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,080
还有这三个... "找" "攻" "做"
and these three... "Get" "A" "Job."

276
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,150
还有一个以防万一 是给她妈妈做的
Oh, and one for the mom that says, "I still love you,"

277
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,250
"我还爱你"
just in case.

278
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,750
快点起床
Now come on, get up.

279
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,120
你儿子要出去散步拉屎了
Your son needs to go out and take an 8-foot crap.

280
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,030
不 我罢工了
No, I'm done.

281
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,640
如果大家都不要纸杯蛋糕了 我也不要了
If everyone's done with cupcakes, so am I.

282
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,560
我不想再假装一切都会顺利了
I'm done pretending that everything's gonna work out.

283
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,150
在我们的真人秀里 一切都糟透了
In our reality show, it's not.

284
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:39,490
听好了 现在起床 不然我就把你连床一起合起来
Look, get up, or I will close this bed with you in it,

285
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,570
你的新真人秀就是"真人真事: 我住在墙里"
and your new reality show will be True Life: I live in a wall.

286
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,450
我绝对不会起床的
I'm not getting up. Ever.

287
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,660
啊! Max 住手! 住手!
Aah! Max, stop, stop it! Stop it!

288
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,250
放我下来! 放我下来!
Put me down! Put me down!

289
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,500
怎么了?
What's happening?

290
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,010
我抬不起头了
I can't lift my head.

291
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,510
是不是中风了?
Did I have a stroke?

292
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,760
冷静点 没人在你床上中风过
Calm down. No one has stroked in your bed

293
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,200
除非... 做上一年?
Since... What is it, going on a year?

294
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,180
Max 我的头发被夹住了
Max. My hair is caught.

295
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,100
我的头发被夹住了! 我的头发被夹住了!
My hair is caught! My hair is caught!

296
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,440
你在对谁吼呢?
Who are you yelling at?

297
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,800
这该死的状况! 想想办法!
The whole situation! Do something!

298
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,390
我来看看
Let me look.

299
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,360
没错 都卷进床的齿轮里了
Oh yeah, it's all caught up in the bed gears here.

300
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,650
天啊 我的床竟然有齿轮
Oh my god, I have a bed with gears

301
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,480
我的头发还被夹住了!
and my hair is caught in it!

302
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,540
不行
Ooh, nope.

303
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,650
真的完全卷进去了
It's really all stuck up in there.

304
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,290
太奇怪了
It's so odd.

305
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,710
真不知道怎么会发生这种事
I don't know how a thing like this could happen.

306
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,050
是你要把我翻到墙上的
Uh, you put me up into the wall.

307
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:40,330
现在我被卡在折叠床上
And now I'm trapped in a murphy bed

308
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,000
就像个倒霉版的长发公主
like some welfare rapunzel.

309
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,840
别惊慌 我有剪刀
Stop panicking, I'll get a scissors.

310
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,920
对 没错! 快去拿剪刀
Oh, yeah, yeah! Get the scissors.

311
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,810
然后一下扎进我胸口 因为要剪头发
Then plunge 'em into my heart 'cause I'd rather die

312
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,980
我宁愿死
than cut my hair.

313
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,810
好吧 Max 我想到办法了
Okay, Max, I think I have something that might work,

314
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,550
但你得保证
but you have to promise me

315
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,350
不会再提起这件事
that you will never bring this up again.

316
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,480
什么事? 你的头卡在
What? The fact that your head

317
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:00,990
床上这件事?
is stuck to your bed?

318
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,520
抱歉 我肯定会再提的
Sorry, that's coming up again.

319
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,910
去翻我的床头柜
Go into my nightstand

320
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,940
然后把我那瓶肉桂味的卸妆油拿出来
and get my cinnamon-flavored make-up remover.

321
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,330
你是说润滑油吧?
You mean the lube?

322
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,530
我们能不能就叫它卸妆油?
Can we please call it make-up remover?

323
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,340
求你了! 就这样叫吧
Please! I need us to do that.

324
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,170
快用完了
It's almost empty.

325
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,710
天啊 你还真是卸了很多妆
Man, you've removed a lot of make-up.

326
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,260
别说了! 挤点出来
Stop it! Just squeeze some out

327
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,710
涂到我们想要润滑的部位
and put it on the parts that we need to move.

328
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,050
这个我在行
Yeah, I'm familiar.

329
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,180
呃!
Ew!

330
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,220
拜托告诉我这方法有用
Please tell me it's working.

331
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,780
我在试 但我觉得没法把你的头发救出来
I'm trying, but I don't think I can get your hair out.

332
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,060
好消息是 我觉得可以轻松插入了
Good news is, I think we can fit a penis in there.

333
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,950
会是谁?
Who could that be?

334
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,650
我们经常为之卖命的强奸犯
A rapist we've done most of the work for.

335
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,250
我们正好说到你
Oh, we were just talking about you.

336
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:04,000
Max 你得帮我做Han要的土司面包
Max, you gotta help me with the bread for Han's toast.

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,720
我已经烤焦十条了
I've already burned ten of these.

338
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,220
事实证明我能成功烤出来的只有兴奋剂
Turns out the only thing I can successfully bake is meth.

339
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,430
Oleg 快到床上来 我需要你!
Oleg, come to the bed. I need you!

340
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,680
好啊!
All right!

341
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,980
尽管等了四年时间 但我就在这里 宝贝
Only took you four years, but I'm here, baby.

342
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
不 不是你想的那样 Oleg
No, it's not like that, Oleg.

343
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,600
快点过来!
Just get over here!

344
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,740
好的
Okay.

345
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,770
拿好
Hold this.

346
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,420
Earl 你在这里干什么?
Earl, what are you doing here?

347
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,780
Oleg打电话给我 说他没法让Caroline
Oleg called me when he couldn't get Caroline

348
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,570
停止尖叫
to stop the screaming.

349
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:48,130
Max 嗨 Earl分了我一块布朗宁
Hi, Max. Earl gave me part of a brownie.

350
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,840
事实证明 青光眼和头发被夹住
Turns out, glaucoma and having hair stuck

351
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,800
治疗的方子完全一样
take the exact same prescription.

352
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,020
快看!
Look!

353
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,020
这就对了 伙计们!
That's right, you mothers!

354
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,770
我做到了!
I did it!

355
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,810
我烤出了完美的面包!
I made the perfect bread!

356
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,310
你是个厨师 却花了19个小时才做出一条面包
You're a chef who took 19 hours to make one loaf of bread.

357
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,150
史蒂芬·霍金百米跑的成绩都比你好
Stephen Hawking was more successful at the 100-yard dash.

358
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,320
还有你... 你知不知道
And you... You are aware

359
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,790
我跑去曼哈顿 给金·卡戴珊
that I went all the way into Manhattan,

360
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,820
住的酒店送了一堆恶意纸杯蛋糕
cupcake-bombed Kim Kardashian's hotel,

361
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,630
结果回来你竟然还躺着
and you're still just laying here, right?

362
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:23,980
你不用嘘嘘吗?
Didn't you have to pee?

363
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,160
大部分尿我都憋住了
I held most of it in.

364
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,300
真是疯了 你都这样一整天了
This is crazy. You've been here all day.

365
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,250
我们还是把你的头发剪掉吧
Let's just cut your damn hair already.

366
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,090
没了头发 我就不是我了
I wouldn't be me without my hair.

367
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,640
我活不下去的
I can't live without it.

368
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,340
你能活下去
Yes, you can.

369
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,760
没有钱 没有电
You have lived without money,

370
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,310
没人陪你做活塞运动
you've lived without electricity,

371
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,850
你不都活下来了
you've lived without plumbing.

372
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,560
你觉得我是靠什么撑过来的?
What do you think got me through it?

373
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,520
我的头发
My hair.

374
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,020
我就想 "钱都没了 马桶堵了
I'd be like, "Lost all my money, the toilet's clogged,

375
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,190
幸好我的头发还在"
still got my hair."

376
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,190
亲爱的 我想那些布朗宁可能不够劲
Darling, I don't think those brownies are kicking in.

377
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,160
我还有棒棒糖哦
I also have some lollipops.

378
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,580
我希望你满意了
I hope you're happy.

379
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,200
猫眼里什么都没看到
I didn't see anything through the peep-hole,

380
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,170
所以我猜是Han来了
so I'm guessing it's Han.

381
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,590
你们好!
Ah, hello!

382
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,840
餐厅开门了 员工却没影了!
I have an open diner and no diner staff!

383
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,960
Han 看呀 我做出了完美的面包
Han, look, I made perfect bread.

384
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,720
哇 这比我习惯的尺寸要大得多
Oh, wow. It's bigger than I'm used to.

385
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,190
让我冷静一下 深呼吸
Let me just take a minute and breathe.

386
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,860
我确信自己可以完全吞进去
And I'm sure I can take it all in.

387
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,780
如果你需要帮助
Well, if you need any help,

388
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,730
Caroline有卸妆油的
Caroline's got some make-up remover.

389
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,790
金金发了 金金发了 金金发了!
Kiki tweet, Kiki tweet, Kiki tweet!

390
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,370
她是在说"金金发了"!
She's saying "Kiki tweet"!

391
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,240
他怎么听懂呢? 难道他是海豚人?
How did he understand that? Is he part dolphin?

392
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,550
金·卡戴珊发了我那些恶意蛋糕的照片
Kim Kardashian tweeted a pic of my mean cupcakes

393
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:54,300
然后写着 "Max的手工纸杯蛋糕 #不厚道"
and said, "Max's homemade cupcakes #notcool."

394
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,640
天啊 金·卡戴珊竟然讨厌我认识的人了!
Oh, my God, Kim Kardashian hates someone I know!

395
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:06,260
两千两百万的粉丝都看到了!
That went out to 22 million people!

396
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,600
- 我很抱歉  - 干嘛道歉?
- I'm so sorry.  - Why?

397
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,270
你知道有多少人受不了卡戴珊姐妹吗?
Do you know how many people can't stand the Kardashians?

398
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,940
我们的蛋糕店窗口会被挤爆的!
Our cupcake window will be packed!

399
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,570
快来剪掉
Cut me loose.

400
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,630
嘿 Caroline 我们终于要动剪刀了
Hey, Caroline, we're finally about to scissor.

401
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,580
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

402
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,450
我们有生意要做
We got a business to run.

403
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:26,870
快剪 我不会有事的
Cut it, I'll be fine.

404
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,100
啊!
Aah!

405
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,520
好吧 你还是吃根棒棒糖吧
Yeah, you're gonna need that lollipop.

406
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,910
我明白 卡戴珊姐妹最讨厌了
Yeah, I know, those Kardashians are the worst.

407
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,500
所以我再也不跟她们同行了
That's why I don't keep up with them anymore.

408
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,670
好了 Max 挺不错的
All right, Max. Okay, that's it.

409
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,870
只剩一个了 是不错
Just one left. Not bad.

410
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,290
你的发型也不错
And your hair's not bad either.

411
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,790
现在是不错
Yeah, now,

412
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,620
幸好我及时赶到发廊
after the emergency trip to that salon.

413
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,960
在你刚剪完的时候
When you got done with me,

414
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,210
我看上去就像只做过化疗的小鸟
I looked like a baby bird on chemo.

415
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,930
抱歉我花光了最后的积蓄去剪了这个头发
I'm sorry I had to use the last of our savings for my hair cut.

416
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,300
- 你才不抱歉  - 没错 我爱这个发型
- No, you're not.  - No, I am not, I love this.

417
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,640
嗨 我是金
Hi, I'm Kim.

418
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,910
我只是想来道歉
I just wanted to say sorry

419
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,820
我们那天没有过来拍摄
that we didn't film here the other day.

420
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,320
光看着她 我就快被亮瞎了
It almost hurts to look at her.

421
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,460
我知道你们两个为了生意
I know how hard us girls really work

422
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,740
有多努力工作
to keep our businesses going,

423
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,210
所以我会买个小蛋糕
so I'll take a cupcake

424
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,710
然后认认真真发一条微博
and I'll totally tweet about it for real.

425
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,380
太谢谢你了
Thank you so much.

426
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,750
这个蛋糕 拿着 拿着
Here, here, here, here, here.

427
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,670
100块的我们找不开 无所谓了
We can't break a $100, and anyway,

428
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,720
这个就当我们请的
this is so on the house.

429
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,670
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

430
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,190
发型很不错
Cute hair.

431
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,480
等等 就一个问题...
Wait. Real quick...

432
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,180
你觉得你妈妈会收养我吗?
Do you think your mother would adopt me?

433
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,270
这真是超级尴尬的
This is super awkward.
