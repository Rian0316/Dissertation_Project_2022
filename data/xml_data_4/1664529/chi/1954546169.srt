1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,400
The great artisans say the more the teapot is used

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,040
the more beautiful it becomes.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,000
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly pouring tea over the surface.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,320
The deposit left on the clay creates this beautiful patina over time.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,760
Some pots, the clay has been burnished by tea made over 400 years ago.

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,160
This museum will be closing in 10 minutes.

7
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,200
400 years old, they're letting you use it to make yourself a brew.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,360
Some things aren't supposed to sit behind glass,

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,040
they're made to be touched.

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,160
To be handled.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,560
These pots need attention.

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,440
The clay is cracking.

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,880
Well, I can't see how a tiny splash of tea is going to help.

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,200
Sometimes you have to look hard at something to see its value.

15
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,440
See?

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,640
This one shines a little brighter.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,720
I don't suppose...

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,840
Um, I mean...

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't suppose that you want to have a drink?

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,080
Not tea, obviously. Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,320
You wouldn't like me all that much.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,720
Can I maybe decide that for myself?

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,680
I can't.

24
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Please stop asking.

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,440
Is that security?

27
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,920
Hello?

28
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,800
Can the till supervisor please go to...?

29
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,480
Unexpected item in bagging area,

30
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,640
please try again.

31
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Item not scanned. Please try again.

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,600
Can you maybe keep your voice down?

33
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,160
- Card not authorised. - Yes, all right! I've got it.

34
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,760
Please use an alternative method of payment. Card not authorised.

35
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,760
Please use an alternative method of payment.

36
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,320
Keep it. Keep that.

37
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,720
- You took your time. - Yeah, I didn't get the shopping.

38
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
What? Why not?

39
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,560
Because I had a row in the shop with a chip and PIN machine.

40
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,840
You...You had a row with a machine?!

41
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,430
Sort of. It sat there and I shouted abuse.

42
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,920
Have you got cash?

43
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Take my card.

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,840
You could always go yourself, you know, you've been sitting there all morning,

45
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,280
you've not even moved since I left.

46
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,670
And what happened about that case you were offered - the Jaria diamond?

47
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,880
Not interested.

48
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,560
I sent them a message.

49
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,360
Don't worry about me, I can manage.

50
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


51
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


52
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


53
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


54
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


55
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,340


56
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,760
- Is that my computer? - Of course.

57
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,560
- What? - Mine was in the bedroom.

58
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,520
What? And you couldn't be bothered to get up?

59
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,080
It's password protected.

60
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,200
In a manner of speaking.

61
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,040
Took me less than a minute to guess yours,

62
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
not exactly Fort Knox.

63
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,600
Right. Thank you.

64
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,760
- Need to get a job. - Oh, dull.

65
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,520
Listen, um...

66
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
..if you'd be able to lend me some...

67
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,080
- Sherlock, are you listening? - I need to go to the bank.

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
Yes, when you said we were going to the bank...

69
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,540


70
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,820


71
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,580


72
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,640
Sherlock Holmes.

73
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,920
Sherlock Holmes.

74
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,600
- Sebastian. - Hiya, buddy. how long - eight years

75
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
since I last clapped eyes on you?

76
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,670
This is my friend, John Watson.

77
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,160
- Friend? - Colleague.

78
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,280
Right.

79
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Grab a pew.

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,720
Do you need anything, coffee, water?

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,600
No. We're all sorted here, thanks.

82
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,120
So you're doing well. You've been abroad a lot.

83
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,760
Well, so?

84
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,200
Flying all the way around the world twice in a month.

85
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,480
Right. You're doing that thing.

86
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,190
We were at uni together,

87
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,280
and this guy here had a trick he used to do.

88
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
It's not a trick.

89
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,840
He could look at you and tell you your whole life story.

90
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,170
Yes, I've seen him do it.

91
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,280
Put the wind up everybody, we hated him.

92
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,400
We'd come down to breakfast in the formal hall

93
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,440
and this freak would know you'd been shagging the previous night.

94
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,530
I simply observed.

95
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,900
Go on, enlighten me.

96
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,140
Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world,

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,600
you're quite right.

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,940
How could you tell?

99
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,120
Are you going to tell me there's a stain on my tie

100
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,600
from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan?

101
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,080
- No, I... - Is it the mud on my shoes?

102
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,080
I was just chatting with your secretary outside.

103
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,640
She told me.

104
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm glad you could make it over, we've had a break-in.

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
Sir William's office -   the bank's former chairman.

106
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,520
The room's been left here like a sort of memorial.

107
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,600
Someone broke in late last night.

108
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,160
- What did they steal? - Nothing.

109
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,640
Just left a little message.

110
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
60 seconds apart.

111
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,920
So, someone came up here in the middle of the night,

112
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,520
splashed paint around and left within a minute.

113
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
How many ways into that office?

114
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,480
Well, that's where this gets really interesting.

115
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,320
Every door that opens in this bank, it gets locked right here.

116
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,280
Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.

117
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,760
That door didn't open last night?

118
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,760
There's a hole in our security.

119
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,400
Find it and we'll pay you -

120
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
five figures.

121
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,760
This is an advance.

122
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,400
Tell me how he got in.

123
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,920
There's a bigger one on its way.

124
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,120
I don't need an incentive, Sebastian.

125
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,680
He's, er..he's kidding you, obviously.

126
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,440
Shall I look after that for him?

127
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,920
Thanks.

128
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,980


129
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,420


130
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,860


131
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Two trips around the world this month.

132
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,180
You didn't ask his secretary,

133
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,240
you said that just to irritate him.

134
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,080
- How did you know? - Did you see his watch?

135
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
His watch?

136
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,160
The time was right, but the date was wrong.

137
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
Said two days ago. Crossed the date line twice and he didn't alter it.

138
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,160
- Within a month? How did you get that? - New Breitling.

139
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,600
Only came out this February.

140
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,320
OK. So do you think we should sniff around here for a bit longer?

141
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Got everything I need to know already, thanks.

142
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,560
That graffiti was a message.

143
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,420
Someone at the bank, working on the trading floors.

144
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,060
We find the intended recipient and...

145
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
They'll lead us to the person who sent it?

146
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Obvious.

147
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,180
Well, there's 300 people up there, who was it meant for?

148
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,700
- Pillars. - What?

149
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,780
Pillars and the screens.

150
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,580
Very few places you could see that graffiti from.

151
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,270
That narrows the field considerably.

152
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,180
And, of course, the message was left at 11:34 last night.

153
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,300
That tells us a lot.

154
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,140
- Does it? - Traders come to work at all hours.

155
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,900
Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night.

156
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,220


157
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,260
That message was intended for somebody who came in at midnight.

158
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,020
Not many Van Coons in the phone book.

159
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,300


160
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,060
Taxi!

161
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,820


162
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,900
So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for him to come back?

163
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,860
- Just moved in. - What?

164
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,140
- Floor above, new label. - Could have just replaced it.

165
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,460


166
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,130
No-one ever does that.

167
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,260
Hello?

168
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,940
Hi, um, I live in the flat just below you. I don't think we've met.

169
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,540
No, well, er, I've just moved in.

170
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,700
Actually, I've just locked my keys in my flat.

171
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,100
Do you want me to buzz you in?

172
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,620
Yeah. And can we use your balcony?

173
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,740
What?!

174
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,100
Sherlock?

175
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,060
Sherlock, are you OK?

176
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,220
Yeah, any time you feel like letting me in!

177
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,660
Do you think he'd lost a lot of money?

178
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,860
Suicide is pretty common among City boys.

179
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,900
- We don't know that it was suicide. - Come on.

180
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,020
The door was locked from the inside, you had to climb down the balcony.

181
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,140
Been away three days judging by the laundry.

182
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,460
Look at the case, there was something tightly packed inside it.

183
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,300
- Thanks. I'll take your word for it. - Problem?

184
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,940
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around some bloke's dirty underwear.

185
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,500
Those symbols at the bank, the graffiti, why were they put there?

186
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,580
- Some sort of code? - Obviously.

187
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,980
Why were they painted? Want to communicate, why not use e-mail?

188
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,580
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

189
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,100
Oh, good, you follow.

190
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,940
No.

191
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:33,540
What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid?

192
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,580
What about this morning?

193
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,060
- Those letters you were looking at? - Bills?

194
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,140
Yes. He was being threatened.

195
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,780
Not by the Gas Board.

196
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,580
...see if we can get prints off this glass.

197
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,540
Sergeant, we haven't met.

198
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,860
Yeah, I know who you are

199
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,260
and I would prefer it if you didn't tamper with any of the evidence.

200
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,550
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?

201
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,020
He's busy. I'm in charge.

202
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,860
And it's not Sergeant, it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

203
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,500
We're obviously looking at a suicide.

204
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,100
It does seem the only explanation of all the facts.

205
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,620
Wrong, it's one possible explanation of some of the facts.

206
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,020
You've got a solution that you like, but you are choosing

207
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,060
to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it.

208
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,980
- Like? - Wound's on the right side of his head.

209
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,260
- And? - Van Coon was left-handed.

210
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,700
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

211
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,120
- Left-handed? - I'm amazed you didn't notice.

212
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,340
All you have to do is look around this flat.

213
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,260
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

214
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,900
coffee mug handle pointing to the left.

215
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,850
Power sockets, habitually used the ones on the left.

216
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,410
Pen and paper on the left of the phone.

217
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,660
Because he picked up with his right, took messages with his left.

218
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,460
- D'you want me to go on? - No, I think you've covered it.

219
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,220
I might as well, I'm almost at the bottom of the list.

220
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,940
There's a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade

221
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,020
because he used it with his left.

222
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:50,660
It's highly unlikely

223
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,900
that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right of his head.

224
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,060
Conclusion, someone broke in here and murdered him -

225
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,980
only explanation of all of the facts.

226
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,060
- But the gun? - He was waiting for the killer.

227
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,900
- He'd been threatened. - What?

228
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,780
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

229
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,820
He fired a shot when his attacker came in.

230
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,340
- And the bullet? - Went through the open window.

231
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,260
Oh, come on!

232
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,020
What are the chances of that?!

233
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,260
Wait until you get the ballistics report.

234
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,060
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

235
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,300
If his door was locked from the inside, how did the killer get in?

236
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,180
Good, you're finally asking the right questions.

237
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,500
He's left trying to sort of cut his hair with a fork,

238
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,300
which of course can never be done.

239
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,180
It was a threat, that's what the graffiti meant.

240
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,340
I'm kind of in a meeting.

241
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:42,700
Can you make an appointment with my secretary?

242
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,940
I don't think this can wait. Sorry, Sebastian.

243
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,940
One of your traders, someone who worked in your office, was killed.

244
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,740
- What? - Van Coon.

245
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,820
The police are at his flat.

246
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:56,070
- Killed?! - Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion.

247
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,900
Still want to make an appointment?

248
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,180
Would maybe nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit?

249
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,060
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

250
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,100
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

251
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,780
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

252
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,020
Lost 5 million in a single morning, made it all back a week later.

253
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,620
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

254
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,020
- Who'd want to kill him? - We all make enemies.

255
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,780
You don't all end up with a bullet through your temple.

256
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,220
Not usually. Excuse me.

257
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,460
It's my chairman.

258
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,340
Police have been on to him.

259
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,010
Apparently they're telling him it was a suicide.

260
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,340
Well, they've got it wrong, Sebastian. He was murdered.

261
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:43,220
Well, I'm afraid they don't see it like that.

262
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,460
- So? - And neither does my boss.

263
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,660
I hired you to do a job. Don't get sidetracked.

264
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,580
I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards.

265
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,580
I need you to get over to Crispians.

266
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,700
Two Ming vases up for auction - Chenghua.

267
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,410
Will you appraise them?

268
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,900
Soo Lin should go. She's the expert.

269
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,500
Soo Lin has resigned her job. I need you.

270
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,140


271
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,820


272
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,900
- Just locum work. - No, that's fine.

273
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,100
You're, um... well, you're a bit over-qualified.

274
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,180
Er, I could always do with the money.

275
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,700
Well, we've got two away on holiday this week

276
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,180
and one's just left to have a baby.

277
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,940
It might be a bit mundane for you.

278
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,740
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

279
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,340
Mundane works.

280
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,540
- It says here you were a soldier. - And a doctor.

281
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,940
Anything else you can do?

282
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,980
I learned the clarinet at school.

283
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,620
Oh..well, I'll look forward to it.

284
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,380
I said, could you pass me a pen?

285
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,780
- What? When? - About an hour ago.

286
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,700
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

287
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,740
I went to see about a job at that surgery.

288
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,660
- How was it? - Great. She's great.

289
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,620
Who?

290
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,900
The job.

291
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,980
She?!

292
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,100
It.

293
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,420
Yeah, have a look.

294
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,940
"The intruder who can walk through walls."

295
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,070
It happened last night.

296
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,070
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

297
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,440
Doors locked, windows bolted from the inside.

298
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,180
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

299
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,220
- God! You think...? - He's killed another one.

300
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,460


301
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,270
Brian Lukis, freelance journalist,

302
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,580
murdered in his flat.

303
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,790
Doors locked from the inside.

304
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,630
You've got to admit, it's similar.

305
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,290
Both men killed by someone

306
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,670
who can walk through solid walls.

307
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,220
Inspector, do you seriously believe

308
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:50,550
that Eddie Van Coon was just another city suicide?

309
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,590
You have seen the ballistics report, I suppose?

310
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,930
And the shot that killed him was it fired from his own gun?

311
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:01,940
- No. - No. So this investigation might move a bit quicker

312
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:04,070
if you were to take my word as gospel.

313
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,640
I've just handed you a murder inquiry.

314
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,780
Five minutes in his flat.

315
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,360
Four floors up.

316
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,770
That's why they think they're safe.

317
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
Put a chain across the door,

318
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,820
bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.

319
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,780
They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in.

320
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,660
- I don't understand. - Dealing with a killer who can climb.

321
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,130
What are you doing?

322
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,250
Clings to the walls like an insect.

323
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,090
That's how he got in.

324
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,210
What?!

325
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,410
He climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof,

326
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,050
dropped in through this skylight.

327
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,180
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

328
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,250
He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building,

329
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,420
jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.

330
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,850
Oh, hold on!

331
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,350
And of course that's how he got into the bank -

332
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,440
He ran along the window ledge onto the terrace.

333
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,940
I have to find out what connects these two men.

334
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,460


335
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,400
Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died.

336
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,420
Sherlock?

337
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,410
So, the killer goes to the bank,

338
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,220
leaves a threatening cipher for Van Coon.

339
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,310
Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in.

340
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,100
Hours later, he dies.

341
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,050
The killer finds Lukis at the library,

342
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,220
he writes the cipher on the shelf where he knows it'll be seen.

343
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,800
Lukis goes home.

344
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,950
Late that night, he dies too.

345
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,290
Why did they die, Sherlock?

346
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,680
Only the cipher can tell us.

347
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,200
The world's run on codes and ciphers, John.

348
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,890
From the million-pound security system at the bank

349
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,700
to the PIN machine you took exception to.

350
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,670
Cryptography inhabits our every waking moment.

351
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,850
Yes, OK, but...

352
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,040
But it's all computer generated

353
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,090
electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods.

354
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,280
This is different.

355
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,430
It's an ancient device.

356
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,640
Modern code-breaking methods won't unravel it.

357
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,650
- Where are we headed? - I need to ask some advice.

358
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,250
What?! Sorry?

359
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,500
You heard me perfectly. I'm not saying it again.

360
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,170
- You need advice? - On painting.

361
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,030
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

362
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,760
Part of a new exhibition.

363
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,640
- Interesting. - I call it...

364
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,860
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.

365
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,490
Catchy!

366
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:43,560
I've got two minutes before a Community Support Officer

367
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,980
comes around that corner.

368
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,650
Can we do this while I'm working?

369
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,940
Know the author?

370
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,310
I recognise the paint.

371
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,360
It's like Michigan...hard-core propellant.

372
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,020
I'd say zinc.

373
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,140
And what about the symbols? Do you recognise them?

374
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,110
I'm not even sure it's a proper language.

375
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,530
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

376
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,820
Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them.

377
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,190
And this is all you've got to go on?

378
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,760
- It's hardly much, is it? - Are you going to help us or not?

379
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,280
I'll ask around.

380
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,310
Somebody must know something about it.

381
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,090
What the hell do you think you're doing?

382
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,000
This gallery is a listed public building.

383
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,800
No, no. Wait, wait. It's not me who painted that.

384
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,120
I was just holding this for...

385
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,130
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

386
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:46,160
She was right in the middle of an important piece of restoration.

387
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,990
Why would she suddenly resign?

388
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:50,150
Family problems. She said so in her letter.

389
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,280
But she doesn't have a family.

390
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,030
She came to this country on her own.

391
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,820
- Andy! - Look, those teapots, those ceramics.

392
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,220
They've become her obsession.

393
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,800
She's been working on restoring them for weeks.

394
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,820
I can't believe that she would just...abandon them.

395
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,880
Perhaps she was getting a bit of unwanted attention?

396
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,470
You've been a while.

397
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,310
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

398
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,700
Custody sergeants don't really like to be hurried, do they?

399
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,940
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

400
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,750
charge sheet, and I've got to be in Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.

401
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:36,700
- What? - Me, Sherlock! In court, on Tuesday!

402
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,180
- They're giving me an ASBO! - Good, fine.

403
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,820
You want to tell your little pal, he's welcome to go and own up any time.

404
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,390
This symbol, I still can't place it.

405
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,620
No, I need you to go to the police station

406
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,050
and ask about the journalist.

407
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,690
The personal effects will have been impounded.

408
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,470
Get hold of his diary, or something that will tell us his movements.

409
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,110
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

410
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,310
If you retrace their steps, somewhere they'll coincide.

411
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,320
Scotland Yard.

412
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,820
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

413
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,490
Looks like he had back-to-back meetings with the sales team.

414
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,970
Can you print me up a copy?

415
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,270
- Sure. - What about the day he died?

416
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,810
Can you tell me where he was?

417
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,380
Sorry, I've got a gap.

418
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,410
I have all his receipts.

419
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,080
- Your friend... - Listen, whatever you say,

420
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,100
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

421
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,610
...he's an arrogant sod.

422
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,760
Well, that was mild. People say a lot worse than that.

423
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:48,180
This is what you wanted, isn't it? The journalist's diary?

424
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,980


425
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,980


426
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,980


427
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,400
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative?

428
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,360
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

429
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,600
The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag.

430
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,670
Like that hand cream. He bought that for you, didn't he?

431
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,890
Look at this one.

432
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,170


433
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,790
That would get him to the office.

434
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,480
Not rush hour. Check the time. Mid-morning. 18 would get him

435
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,310
- as far as... - ..The West End. I remember him saying.

436
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,610
Underground, printed at one in Piccadilly.

437
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:31,230
So he got a Tube back to the office.

438
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,640
Why would he get a taxi into town, and then the Tube back?

439
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,750
Because he was delivering something heavy.

440
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,660
You wouldn't lug a package up the escalator.

441
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,290
Delivering?!

442
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,020
To somewhere near Piccadilly Station.

443
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,690
Dropped the package, delivered it, and then...

444
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,640
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

445
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,380


446
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,220


447
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,460
So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station

448
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,350
but where were you headed from?

449
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,930
Where did the taxi drop you?

450
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,260
Oof! Right.

451
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,980
Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died.

452
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,480
Whatever was hidden inside that case...

453
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,620
I've managed to piece together a picture

454
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,070
using scraps of information - credit card bills, receipts.

455
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,660
- He flew back from China, then he came here.  - Sherlock.

456
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,020
Somewhere in this street, somewhere near. I don't know where, but...

457
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,260
That shop, over there.

458
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,740
How could you tell?

459
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,500
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

460
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,800
He wrote down the address.

461
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:48,700
Hello.

462
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,140
You want... lucky cat?

463
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,780
No, thanks, no.

464
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:02,540


465
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,820
I think your wife, she will like.

466
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,820
Um, thank you.

467
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,980
Sherlock...

468
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,640
- The label there.  - Yes, I see it.

469
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,740
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

470
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,560
It's an ancient number system. Hang Zhou.

471
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,920
These days only street traders use it.

472
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,080
Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library.

473
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,160
Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect.

474
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,840
It's a 15.

475
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,960
What we thought was the artist's tag, it's a number 15.

476
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,920
And the blindfold, the horizontal line. That was a number as well.

477
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,320
- The Chinese number one, John.  - We found it.

478
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,240
Two men travel back from China,

479
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,880
both head straight for the Lucky Cat emporium.

480
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,080
What did they see?

481
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,160
It's not what they saw.

482
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,520
It's what they both brought back in those suitcases.

483
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,680
And you don't mean duty free.

484
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,040
Thank you.

485
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,440
Think about what Sebastian told us.

486
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,160
About Van Coon, about how he stayed afloat in the market.

487
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,080
- Lost 5 million.  - Made it back in a week.

488
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,920
That's how he made such easy money.

489
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,680
He was a smuggler. Mm.

490
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
Cover would have been perfect.

491
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,800
Businessman, making frequent trips to Asia.

492
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,000
Lukis was the same, a journalist writing about China.

493
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,440
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

494
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,720
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

495
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,880
But why did they die?

496
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,310
It doesn't make sense.

497
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,560
If they both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods,

498
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,240
why would someone threaten them

499
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,480
and kill them after the event, after they'd finished the job?

500
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,600
What if one of them was light-fingered?

501
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,560
- How do you mean?  - Stole something.

502
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,080
Something from the hoard.

503
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,080
The killer doesn't know which of them took it

504
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,560
so threatens them both. Right.

505
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,160
Remind me.

506
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,760
When was the last time that it rained?

507
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,540


508
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,600
It's been here since Monday.

509
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,500


510
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,360
No-one's been in that flat for at least three days.

511
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,400
Could have gone on holiday.

512
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,200
Do you leave your windows open when you go on holiday?

513
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,960
Sherlock!

514
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,280
Someone else has been here.

515
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,730
Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase,

516
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:17,320
just like I did.

517
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,960
Do you think maybe you could let me in this time?

518
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,160
Can you not keep doing this, please?

519
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,320
I'm not the first.

520
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,360
- What?  - Somebody's been in here before me.

521
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,960
What are you saying?

522
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,480
Size eight feet.

523
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,240
Small, but...athletic.

524
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,040
I'm wasting my breath.

525
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,040
Small, strong hands.

526
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,880
Our acrobat.

527
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,800
Why didn't he close the window when he lef...?

528
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,720
Oh, stupid, stupid!

529
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Obvious.

530
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
He's still here.

531
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,960
Any time you want to include me...

532
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,760
John...

533
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,880
John!

534
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone

535
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,600
because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect!

536
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,320
The milk's gone off and the washing's started to smell.

537
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,200
- Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago.  - Somebody?

538
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,920
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

539
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,640
How, exactly?

540
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,640


541
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,240


542
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,720
We could start with this.

543
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,720
You've gone all croaky. Are you getting a cold?

544
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,360
I'm fine.

545
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,080
When was the last time that you saw her?

546
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,600
Three days ago. Here at the museum.

547
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,560
This morning they told me she'd resigned.

548
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,120
Just like that. Left her work unfinished.

549
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,000
What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon?

550
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,320
She does this demonstration for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

551
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,920
So she would have packed up her things and just put them in here.

552
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,120
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

553
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,440
- If she's still alive.  - Sherlock!

554
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,080
Oh, look who it is.

555
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,520
Found something you'll like.

556
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,880
Tuesday morning,

557
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,000
all you've got to do is turn up and say the bag was yours.

558
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,600
Forget about your court date.

559
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,120
Dude, that was rad!

560
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,600
You want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it,

561
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,280
wouldn't you say?

562
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,960
People would just walk straight past, not knowing,

563
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,760
unable to decipher the message.

564
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,040
There. I spotted it earlier.

565
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,920
They've been here. And that's the exact same paint?

566
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
Yeah.

567
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,160
John, if we're going to decipher this code,

568
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,840
we need to look for more evidence.

569
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,720
Answer your phone. I've been calling you.

570
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,480
I found it.

571
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,240
It's been painted over.

572
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,080
I don't understand. It was... here.

573
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,640
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

574
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,400
A whole load of graffiti.

575
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,480
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

576
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,760
- Sherlock, what are you doing...?  - Ssh! John, concentrate.

577
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,600
I need you to concentrate. Close your eyes.

578
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,120
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

579
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,800
I need you to maximise your visual memory.

580
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,760
Try to picture what you saw.

581
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,880
- Can you picture it?  - Yeah.

582
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,640
- Can you remember it?  - Yes, definitely.

583
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,720
Can you remember the pattern?

584
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,440
- Yes.  - How much can you remember it?

585
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,600
Look, don't worry.

586
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,040
Because the average human memory on visual matters is only 62% accurate.

587
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,320
- Well, don't worry, I remember all of it.  - Really?

588
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,760
At least I would, if I could get to my pockets. I took a photograph.

589
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,760
Always in pairs, John, look.

590
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,480
Numbers...

591
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,360
come with partners.

592
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,760
God, I need to sleep.

593
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,080
- Why did he paint it so near the tracks? - No idea.

594
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,160
Thousands of people pass by there every day.

595
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
Just 20 minutes...

596
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,160
Of course.

597
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,480
Of course, he wants information. He's trying to communicate

598
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,600
with his people in the underworld.

599
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,720
Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.

600
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,360
It's somewhere here, in a code.

601
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,640
We can't crack this without Soo Lin Yao.

602
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,600
Oh, good.

603
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,360
Two men who travelled back from China were murdered.

604
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,480
And their killer left them messages in Hang Zhou numerals.

605
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

606
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,360
That cipher, it was just the same pattern as the others.

607
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,120
He means to kill her as well.

608
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,040
Look, I've tried everywhere -

609
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,640
friends, colleagues. I don't know where she's gone.

610
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,960
I mean, she could be a thousand miles away.

611
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,120
- What are you looking at? - Tell me more about those teapots.

612
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:19,640
The pots were her obsession. They need urgent work.

613
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,000
If they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble.

614
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,120
Apparently, you have to just keep making tea in them.

615
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,960
Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining.

616
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,680
Now, there are two.

617
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,800
Fancy a biscuit with that?

618
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,800
Centuries old. Don't want to break that.

619
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,320
Hello.

620
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,120
You saw the cipher.

621
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,720
Then you know he is coming for me.

622
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,280
You've been clever to avoid him so far.

623
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,520
I had to finish.

624
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,400
To finish this work.

625
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,480
It's only a matter of time.

626
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,040
I know he will find me.

627
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,960
Who is he? Have you met him before?

628
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,040
When I was a girl, we met in China.

629
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,480
I recognised his...

630
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,840
- signature. - The cipher?

631
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,040
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

632
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:21,600
- Zhi Zhu? - The spider.

633
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,200
You know this mark?

634
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,320
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

635
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,920
- Huh? - Ancient crime syndicate, based in China.

636
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,920
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

637
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,240
Everyone who hauls for them.

638
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,160
Hauls?

639
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,680
You mean you were a smuggler?

640
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,680
I was 15.

641
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,280
My parents were dead.

642
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,320
I had no livelihood.

643
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,040
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

644
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,040
except to work for the bosses.

645
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,840
Who are they?

646
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,880
They are called the Black Lotus.

647
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,240
By the time I was 16,

648
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,400
I was taking thousands of pounds worth of drugs

649
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,320
across the border into Hong Kong.

650
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:35,200
I managed to leave that life behind me.

651
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,000
I came to England.

652
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,920
They gave me a job, here.

653
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,760
Everything was good. New life.

654
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,560
And he came looking for you.

655
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,040
Yes.

656
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,280
I hoped, after five years...

657
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,400
maybe they would have forgotten me.

658
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,280
But they never really let you leave.

659
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,880
A small community like ours...

660
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,400
..they are never very far away.

661
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,480
He came to my flat.

662
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,120
He asked me to help him to track down something that was stolen.

663
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,040
And you've no idea what it was?

664
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,320
I refused to help.

665
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,640
So, you knew him well when you were living back in China?

666
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,400
Oh, yes.

667
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,040
He's my brother.

668
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,200
Two orphans.

669
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,080
We had no choice.

670
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,760
We could work for the Black Lotus,

671
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,440
or starve on the streets, like beggars.

672
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,560
My brother has become their puppet.

673
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,240
In the power of the one they call Shan.

674
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,000
The Black Lotus general.

675
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,640
I turned my brother away.

676
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,360
He said I had betrayed him.

677
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,320
Next day, I came to work

678
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,720
and the cipher was waiting.

679
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,920
Can you decipher these?

680
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,360
- These are numbers. - Yes, I know.

681
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,680
Here, the line across the man's eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

682
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,440
And this one is 15. But what's the code?

683
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,000
All the smugglers know it.

684
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,680
It's based upon a book...

685
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,160
He's here.

686
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:19,680
Zhi Zhu has found me.

687
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,960
No, no, Sherlock.

688
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,000
Sherlock, wait!

689
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,840
Come here.

690
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,800
Get in. Get in!

691
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,160
I have to go and help him. Bolt the door after me.

692
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,040
Careful!

693
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,400
Some of those skulls are over 200,000 years old. Have a bit of respect.

694
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,240
Thank you.

695
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,240
Liang.

696
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,160


697
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,280


698
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,880
Oh, my God.

699
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,960
How many murders is it going to take

700
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,680
before you start believing that this maniac's out there?

701
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,800
A young girl was gunned down tonight.

702
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,640
That's three victims in three days. You're supposed to be finding him.

703
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,000
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

704
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,360
were working for a gang of international smugglers.

705
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,920
A gang called the Black Lotus, operating here in London

706
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,160
right under your nose.

707
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,560
Can you prove that?

708
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:51,160
- What are you thinking? Pork or pasta? - Oh, it's you.

709
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,200
I suppose it's never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

710
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,760
I'd stick with the pasta.

711
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,040
Don't want to be doing roast pork, not if you're slicing up cadavers.

712
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:03,400
What are you having?

713
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,840
I don't eat when I'm working. Digesting slows me down.

714
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,720
So you're working here tonight?

715
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,560
- Need to examine some bodies. - Some?

716
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,360
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

717
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,920
They're on my list.

718
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,800
Could you wheel them out again for me?

719
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,040
Well...their paperwork's already gone through.

720
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,800
- You changed your hair. - What?

721
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,400
The style. It's usually parted in the middle.

722
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,000
Yes, well...

723
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,240
It's good.

724
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,640
It...suits you better this way.

725
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,360
We're just interested in the feet.

726
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,160
- The feet? - Yes.

727
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,960
Do you mind if we have a look at them?

728
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,320
Now, Van Coon.

729
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,640
- Oh! - So...

730
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,960
So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo Parlour,

731
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:19,070
- Or I'm telling the truth. - What do you want?

732
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:21,590
I want every book from Lukis' apartment and Van Coon's.

733
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,830
Their books?

734
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:30,750
Not just a criminal organisation. It's a cult.

735
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,230
Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders.

736
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,670
Soo Lin said the name.

737
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,430
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

738
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,110
We're still no closer to finding him.

739
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,430
Wrong! We've got almost all we need to know.

740
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,510
She gave us most of the missing pieces.

741
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,110
Why did he need to visit his sister?

742
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,610
Why did he need her expertise?

743
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,670
She worked at the museum.

744
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:53,870
- Exactly. - An expert in antiquities.

745
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,820
Of course, I see.

746
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,430
Valuable antiquities, John.

747
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,270
Ancient Chinese relics purchased on the black market.

748
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,510
China's home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao's revolution.

749
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:04,950
The Black Lotus is selling them.

750
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,950


751
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,470
Check for the dates...

752
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:15,110
Here, John, "arrived from China four days ago".

753
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,670
Anonymous.

754
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:20,150
The vendor doesn't give his name.

755
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,630
"Two undiscovered treasures from the East."

756
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,040
One in Lukis' suitcase,

757
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,150
...and one in Van Coon's.

758
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,150
"Antiquities... sold at auction."

759
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,790
Look, here's another one.

760
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:36,040
Arrived from China a month ago,

761
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,950
Chinese ceramic statue sold for 400,000 pounds.

762
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:43,350
Look, a month before that, Chinese painting, 500,000 pounds.

763
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:45,670
All of them from an anonymous source.

764
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:48,060
They're stealing them back in China

765
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,530
...and one by one feeding them into Britain.

766
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,110
Every single auction

767
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,590
coincides with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.

768
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,230
So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China?

769
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,790
What if one of them stole something?

770
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,110
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.

771
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,270
Sorry, are we collecting for charity, Sherlock?

772
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,430
What?

773
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,310
A young man's outside with crates of books.

774
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:17,870
So the numbers are references.

775
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,270
To books.

776
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,670
To specific pages and specific words on those pages.

777
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,070
Right, so... 15 and 1, that means?

778
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,270
Turn to page 15 and it's the first word you read.

779
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:30,420
OK, so what's the message?

780
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,480
Depends on the book.

781
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:34,590
That's the cunning of the book code.

782
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:36,550
It has to be one that they both own.

783
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,350
OK, fine. This shouldn't take too long, should it?

784
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:01,110
We found these at the museum. Is this your writing?

785
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,710
Er, we hoped Soo Lin could decipher it for us.

786
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,230
Anything else I can do?

787
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:11,390
To assist you, I mean.

788
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,750
Some silence right now would be marvellous.

789
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,780


790
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:30,790
Cigarette.

791
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,790
Imagine.

792
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:00,820


793
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,190
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

794
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,990
but we haven't got anything now until next Thursday.

795
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:28,830
This is taking ages.

796
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,190
Sorry.

797
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:33,550
What's the point of booking an appointment if they can't stick to it?

798
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,190
Um, what's going on?

799
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:40,030
That new doctor you hired, he hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

800
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:42,730
Let me go and have a word.

801
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,950
Excuse me. Sorry.

802
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,470
John?

803
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,070
Looks like I'm done. I thought I had some more to see.

804
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,150
- Oh, I did one or two of yours. - One or two?

805
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:13,430
Well, maybe five or six.

806
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:16,170
I'm sorry, that's not very professional.

807
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,810
No, not really.

808
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,290
I had... a bit of a late one.

809
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:25,050
Oh, right.

810
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:27,490
Anyway, see you.

811
00:59:27,490 --> 00:59:32,370
So... what were you doing to keep you up so late?

812
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:35,330
I was attending a sort of book event.

813
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:39,490
Oh. Oh, she likes books, does she, your girlfriend?

814
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,370
No, it wasn't a date.

815
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:45,370
- Good. I mean, I'm...  - And I don't have one tonight.

816
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,290
A book that everybody would own.

817
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:51,900


818
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:53,980


819
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,570
15, entry 1.

820
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,620


821
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,060


822
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,670


823
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:18,350
I need to get some air. We're going out tonight.

824
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,160
- Actually, I've got a date. - What?

825
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,320
Where two people who like each other go out and have fun?

826
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,360
That's what I was suggesting.

827
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:28,480
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

828
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,980
Where are you taking her?

829
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,940
Er, cinema.

830
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,120
Dull, boring, predictable...

831
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:35,400
Why don't you try this?

832
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,280
In London for one night only.

833
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,540


834
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,920
Thanks, but I don't come to you for dating advice.

835
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,120
It's years since anyone took me to the circus.

836
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,360
Right, yes.

837
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:51,480
A friend recommended it to me and I phoned up.

838
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,560
Oh! What are they, a touring company or something?

839
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,280
I don't know much about it.

840
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,160
I think they're probably from China.

841
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,520
I think so, yes. There's a coincidence!

842
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,920
That's wonderful, thank you very much.

843
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:08,080
Hi, I have two tickets reserved for tonight.

844
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,280
- And what's the name? - Holmes.

845
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,040
Actually, I have three in that name.

846
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,560
No, I don't think so, we only booked two.

847
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:22,120
Then I phoned back and got one for myself as well.

848
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,200
I'm Sherlock.

849
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,200
- Hi.  - Hello.

850
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,640
You couldn't let me have just one night off.

851
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,360
Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day.

852
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,160
It fits.

853
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,880
The Tong sent an assassin to England...

854
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:42,160
Dressed as a tightrope walker. Come on, Sherlock, behave!

855
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,240
We're looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope.

856
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,960
Where else would you find that level of dexterity?

857
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,240
Exit visas are scarce in China.

858
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,160
They need a good reason to get out of that country.

859
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,960
All I need to do is have a quick look around...

860
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,120
Fine. You do that, I'll take Sarah for a pint.

861
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,040
I need your help.

862
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,800
I do have a couple of other things on my mind this evening.

863
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:00,040
Like what?

864
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,080
- You are kidding? - What's so important?

865
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,410
Sherlock, I'm in the middle of a date.

866
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,920
You're going to chase some killer while I'm trying to...

867
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,000
What?

868
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,120
While I'm trying to get off with Sarah.

869
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,760
Hey... Ready?

870
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,240
Yeah.

871
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,070
You said circus. This is not a circus.

872
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,180
Look at the size of this crowd.

873
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,600
Sherlock, this is... art.

874
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,550
This is not their day job.

875
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:34,660
Sorry, I forgot,

876
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,880
...they're not a circus, they're a gang of international smugglers.

877
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,970
Classic Chinese escapology act.

878
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:16,540
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

879
01:04:17,170 --> 01:04:20,070
The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires.

880
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:57,510
She splits the sandbag, the sand pours out.

881
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,860
Gradually, the weight lowers into the bowl.

882
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,300
-Thank God. - My God!

883
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,810
Ladies and gentlemen.

884
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,690
From the distant moonlit shores of the Yangtze River,

885
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,500
we present, for your pleasure,

886
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,950
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

887
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,980
Did you see that?

888
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,920
Well, well.

889
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:34,290
Found you.

890
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,730
Come on. Come on. Let's go!

891
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:46,040
I sent a couple of cars. The old hall is totally deserted.

892
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,540
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.

893
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:51,310
The tattoo that we saw, on the two bodies, the mark of the Tong.

894
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,950
Lukis and Van Coon were part of a smuggling operation.

895
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:57,550
One of them stole something in China. Something valuable.

896
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:58,830
The circus performers were gang members

897
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,890
-sent here to get it back. - Get what back?

898
01:09:03,090 --> 01:09:04,000
We don't know.

899
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,890
You don't know?

900
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:10,300
Mr Holmes, I've done everything you asked.

901
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:12,810
Lestrade, he seems to think your advice is worth something.

902
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,340
I gave the order for a raid.

903
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,220
Please tell me I'll have something to show for it.

904
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,740
Other than a massive bill for overtime

905
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,700
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

906
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,910
No, they won't leave without what they came for.

907
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:31,270
We need to find a hideout.

908
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,680
A rendezvous.

909
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,080
Somewhere in this message it must tell us.

910
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:43,650
Well, I think perhaps I should leave you to it.

911
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:46,450
- No, you don't have to go. Stay. - Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

912
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:49,280
He's kidding. Please stay if you'd like.

913
01:09:51,130 --> 01:09:53,410
Is it just me or is anyone else starving?

914
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:54,790
Oh, God.

915
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,200
So this is what you do.

916
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,140
You and John, you solve puzzles for a living.

917
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,510
Consulting detective.

918
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,530
What are these squiggles?

919
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,650
They're numbers. An ancient Chinese dialect.

920
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,850
Oh, right. Well, of course. I should have known that.

921
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,580
I've done punch and a bowl of nibbles.

922
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:43,220
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

923
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:45,330
If it was Monday, I'd have been to the supermarket.

924
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,680
Thank you. Thank you.

925
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:57,170
- So these numbers, it's a cipher? - Exactly.

926
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:58,780
And each pair of numbers is a word?

927
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,540
How did you know that?

928
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:03,820
Well, two words have already been translated. Here.

929
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,160
John.

930
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,700
John, look at this.

931
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:15,220
Soo Lin at the museum, she started to translate the code for us.

932
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,540
We didn't see it.

933
01:11:17,950 --> 01:11:19,220
Nine mill.

934
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:18,260


935
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:20,580


936
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:22,780
Does that mean millions?

937
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:26,740
Nine million quid. For what?

938
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,800
We need to know the end of this sentence.

939
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:29,520
Where are you going?

940
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:31,730
To the museum, to the restoration room.

941
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:34,640
- We must have been staring right at it. - At what?

942
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,130
The book, John. The book. The key to cracking the cipher.

943
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,490
Soo Lin used it to do this.

944
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:39,960
Whilst we were running around the gallery,

945
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,800
She started to translate the code.

946
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,130
It must be on her desk.

947
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:46,620
Taxi!

948
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,100
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

949
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:51,370
Ja, danke!

950
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:09,900


951
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:15,420


952
01:12:16,420 --> 01:12:17,710
A book that everybody would own.

953
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:22,940
Please, wait!

954
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,320
Bitte!

955
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,340
Was wollt er?

956
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:29,810
Hey, du, was machst du?

957
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:30,620
Minute!

958
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,420
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

959
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,500
Yeah. No, absolutely.

960
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,260
I mean, a quiet night in is just what the doctor ordered.

961
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,450
I mean, I love to go out of an evening

962
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,390
and wrestle a few Chinese gangsters generally,

963
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,300
- but a girl can get too much. - OK.

964
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,590
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

965
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,450
Yeah.

966
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,670
Page 15, entry 1...

967
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:01,410
Page 15, entry 1.

968
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:06,960
Dead man.

969
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:08,580


970
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,700


971
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:10,840


972
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:11,580


973
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:11,580


974
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,470
He was threatening to kill them.

975
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:10,490
That's the first cipher.

976
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,760
9... 0... 15...
9... 0... 15...

977
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:20,580
Er, 15 and 36.

978
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:22,030
36, 39, 39...
36, 39, 39...

979
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,060
39...
39...

980
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,790
9...
9...

981
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:33,860
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

982
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:45,280
Blimey, that was quick.

983
01:13:45,340 --> 01:13:46,560
I'll just pop down.

984
01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:49,400
Do you want me to lay the table?

985
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,480
- Um...eat off trays? - Yeah.

986
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:58,230
70...35...
70...35...

987
01:14:00,330 --> 01:14:01,630
Jade...

988
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,580
Jade.

989
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,850
Sorry to keep you. How much do you want?

990
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,460
Do you have it?

991
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,030
What?

992
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:12,300
Do you have the treasure?

993
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,330
I don't understand.

994
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,300
tramway

995
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:30,730
"Nine mill for Jade pin.

996
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,750
"Dragon den, black...

997
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,810
"tramway."

998
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:48,310
John! John, I've got it.

999
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:51,910
The cipher, the book. It's the London A-Z that they use...

1000
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,580
A book is like a magic garden,

1001
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,990
carried in your pocket.

1002
01:15:29,090 --> 01:15:31,740
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.

1003
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,550
I'm...I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

1004
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:39,740
Forgive me, if I do not take your word for it.

1005
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,420
Debit card, name of...

1006
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:47,980
S Holmes.

1007
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,190
Take my card.

1008
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:52,820
Yes, that's not actually mine. He lent that to me.

1009
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:58,780


1010
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:02,220
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

1011
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:05,620
Tickets from the theatre collected by you, name of Holmes.

1012
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,460
Yes, OK.

1013
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,050
- What's the name?  - Er, Holmes.

1014
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,300
I realise what this looks like.

1015
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:11,160
But I'm not him.

1016
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:14,390
- We heard it from your own mouth. - What?

1017
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,200
"I am Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone."

1018
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:23,140
Because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect.

1019
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:24,710
Did I really say that?

1020
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:32,200
I suppose there's no use me trying to persuade you I was doing an impression.

1021
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,280
I am Shan.

1022
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:40,030
You're... You're Shan?

1023
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:44,100
Three times we tried to kill you and your companion, Mr Holmes.

1024
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,740
What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight?

1025
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:06,060
It tells you that they're not really trying.

1026
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,460
Tramway.

1027
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,580
There.

1028
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:34,860
Not blank bullets now. OK.

1029
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:37,040
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,

1030
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:37,900
we would have done it by now.

1031
01:17:37,900 --> 01:17:40,700
We just wanted to make you inquisitive.

1032
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,580
- Do you have it?   - Do I have what?

1033
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:49,100
- The treasure. - I don't know what you're talking about.

1034
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,180
I would prefer to make certain.

1035
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,820
Everything in the West has its price.

1036
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:04,700
And the price for her life - information.

1037
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:31,260
- Where's the hairpin? - What?

1038
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,180
The Empress pin valued at 9 million sterling?

1039
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:37,460
We already had a buyer in the West,

1040
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,170
and then one of our people was greedy,

1041
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,260
he took it, brought it back to London,

1042
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,980
and you, Mr Holmes, have been searching.

1043
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:46,260
Please, please. Listen to me.   I'm not...

1044
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:49,580
I'm not Sherlock Holmes. You have to believe me.

1045
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,420
I haven't found whatever it is you're looking for.

1046
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:54,160
I need a volunteer from the audience.

1047
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:55,540
No, please, please!

1048
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:58,060
Ah, thank you, lady.

1049
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:02,220
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

1050
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,460
Ladies and gentlemen,

1051
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:30,700
from the distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

1052
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:34,380
we present for your pleasure,

1053
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:39,450
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion in a death-defying act.

1054
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,420
Please!

1055
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:46,450
You've seen the act before.

1056
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:48,260
How dull for you.

1057
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,820
You know how it ends.

1058
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,740
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

1059
01:19:51,740 --> 01:19:53,260
I don't believe you.

1060
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,180
You should, you know.

1061
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:58,220
Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him.

1062
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:01,780
How would you describe me, John?

1063
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:04,850
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?

1064
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,660
Late?

1065
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,220
That's a semi-automatic. If you fire it,

1066
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,060
the bullet will travel at over 1,000 metres per second.

1067
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,580
Well?

1068
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,940
Well...

1069
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,140
..the radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres.

1070
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,420
If you miss, the bullet will ricochet.

1071
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,100
Could hit anyone.

1072
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,020
Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.

1073
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:43,660
It's all right.

1074
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,140
You're going to be all right. It's over now.

1075
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,740
Don't worry.

1076
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:58,780
Next date won't be like this.

1077
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:15,220
We'll just slip off. No need to mention us in your report.

1078
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:16,550
Mr Holmes...

1079
01:22:16,550 --> 01:22:18,340
I have high hopes for you, Inspector.

1080
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,660
A glittering career.

1081
01:22:20,660 --> 01:22:22,700
I go where you point me.

1082
01:22:24,740 --> 01:22:26,220
Exactly.

1083
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,180
So, nine million.

1084
01:22:37,180 --> 01:22:38,070
- Million. - Yes

1085
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:42,540
Nine million for Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

1086
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,020
An instruction to all their London operatives.

1087
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,700
A message. What they were trying to reclaim.

1088
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,540
- What, a jade pin? - Worth 9 million pounds.

1089
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:50,700
Bring it to the Tramway,

1090
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,860
their London hideout.

1091
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:54,460
Hang on. A hairpin worth 9 million pounds?

1092
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:56,700
- Apparently. - Why so much?

1093
01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:58,860
Depends who owned it.

1094
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,820
Two operatives based in London.

1095
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:09,700
They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases.

1096
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:13,060
One of them helps himself to something, a little hairpin.

1097
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,540
- Worth 9 million. - Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1098
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:17,540
he stole the treasure when he was in China.

1099
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:19,220
How do you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis?

1100
01:23:19,220 --> 01:23:22,300
- Even the killer didn't know that. - Because of the soap.

1101
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:36,820
- Amanda?   - He brought you a present.

1102
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,300
Oh, hello.

1103
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,980
A little gift when he came back from China.

1104
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:42,380
How do you know that?

1105
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:45,380
You weren't just his PA, were you?

1106
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:46,980
Someone's been gossiping.

1107
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:48,820
- No. - Then I don't understand why...

1108
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:50,780
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1109
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:54,220
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1110
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,220
Sorry...?

1111
01:23:55,220 --> 01:23:59,220
I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap,

1112
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:01,340
not unless he had a lady coming over.

1113
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,940
And it's the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk.

1114
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,580
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1115
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:12,720
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.

1116
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,180
He was my boss.

1117
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,780
What happened? Why did you end it?

1118
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:21,780
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1119
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:23,580
Took me for granted.

1120
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,900
Stood me up once too often.

1121
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,490
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,

1122
01:24:29,490 --> 01:24:30,700
and then he'd just leave.

1123
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,460
Fly off to China at a moment's notice.

1124
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,700
And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry.

1125
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:40,420
Can I just have a look at it?

1126
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:49,380
He really climbed up onto the balcony?

1127
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:51,220
Nail a plank across the window

1128
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,460
and all your problems are over.

1129
01:24:54,780 --> 01:24:56,380
Thanks.

1130
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:59,820
He said he bought it in a street market.

1131
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:02,740
Oh, I don't think that's true. I think he pinched it.

1132
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:04,260
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1133
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:06,700
Didn't know its value, just thought it would suit you.

1134
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,620
Oh? What's it worth?

1135
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,820
9 million pounds.

1136
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:18,060
Oh, my God.

1137
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,620
Oh, my God!

1138
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,740
Nine million?!

1139
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:40,580
Over 1,000 years old and it's sitting on her bedside table every night.

1140
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:41,860
He didn't know its value.

1141
01:25:41,860 --> 01:25:43,620
Didn't know why they were chasing him.

1142
01:25:45,180 --> 01:25:47,860
Should we just got her a lucky cat.

1143
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:54,260
- You mind, don't you? - What?

1144
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:57,220
That she escaped. General Shan.

1145
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,180
It's not enough that we got her two henchmen.

1146
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,980
Must be a vast network, John.

1147
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:02,740
Thousands of operatives.

1148
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:05,260
You and I, we barely scratched the surface.

1149
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,380
You cracked the code though, Sherlock.

1150
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:10,220
And maybe Dimmock can track down all of them now he knows it.

1151
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:14,660
No. No, I crack this code,

1152
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:18,740
all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book.

1153
01:26:44,060 --> 01:26:46,820
Without you...

1154
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:49,820
without your assistance,

1155
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,100
we would not have found passage into London.

1156
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:58,540
You have my thanks.

1157
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:17,140


1158
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:17,140


1159
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,380
We did not anticipate...

1160
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:15,980
We did not know this man would come.

1161
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:20,500
This Sherlock Holmes.

1162
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,580
And now your safety is compromised.

1163
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:36,780


1164
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:39,980
I will not reveal your identity.

1165
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:49,980
