1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,860
Previously on "The Originals"

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,420
This town was my home once,

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,550
and in my absence,

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,760
Marcel has gotten everything
that I ever wanted.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,950
I want it back.

6
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,910
I hereby pledge my allegiance to you.

7
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,480
You have the keys to my kingdom.

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,810
You're choosing him over
me, aren't you, again?

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,710
The only reward anyone ever
gets from loving Niklaus

10
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,400
is suffering and death.

11
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,590
Niklaus, the girl is carrying your child.

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,690
You're coming with me, little wolf.

13
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,960
I've been deemed under protection
by the almighty Klaus.

14
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,030
I believe it is time for my
niece Cami to leave town.

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,460
Leave New Orleans. Forget everything.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,340
Do I know you?

17
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,810
You've been compelled.

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,550
It's ok. I can fix you.

19
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,630
For centuries, people
have come to New Orleans

20
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,460
looking for a fresh start,

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,800
hoping to find fortune,
adventure, even love,

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,820
young society women imported
from France with the promise of

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,340
marrying a proper New Orleans gentleman,

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,250
Like the legendary Casket Girls.

25
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,010
Little did they know that the men

26
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,130
who awaited them were far from proper

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,750
and not at all gentle.

28
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,940
Get them out. We want to see the women.

29
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,560
Come out. Come out here.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,270
Come on. We want the women.

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,580
Oh, there, there, little lambs.

32
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,750
All the bad men have gone away.

33
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,200
Us girls have got to stick together.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,300
Now, is there anything you
want to take with you?

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,720
The Casket Girls' legend lives on,

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,390
now celebrated in typical
New Orleans fashion

37
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,870
with stylish costumes
and supernatural flair.

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,870
It's a yearly reminder of how women

39
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,110
can be oppressed by selfish men

40
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,820
and how they can triumph

41
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,700
when brave enough to fight for themselves.

42
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,310
Oh, god, it hurts!

43
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,470
I'm sorry, Cami.

44
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,440
It's the only way to break
all of Klaus' compulsion.

45
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,320
Believe me, I know what it's like.

46
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,040
You're ok, and, hey, all
these notes that you made,

47
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,090
It's very "memento" of you.

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,040
Nice work.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,010
We've been at this all night.

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,430
I don't understand what's happening to me.

51
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,430
I don't understand any of this.

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,610
But you will.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,440
I will unlock every stolen memory,

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,070
undo every piece of mind control

55
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:41,760
that any vampire has ever done to you.

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,220
When I am done, you will
understand all of it,

57
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,890
and you'll be free.

58
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,420
I can stop if you want me to.

59
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,850
No. Don't stop.

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,310
I want to remember everything.

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,310
Would you like some help?

62
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,550
You might need to use all
your vampire strength.

63
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,320
Allow me.

64
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,050
Thanks.

65
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,920
Not too many pregnant
Casket Girls, I guess.

66
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,800
I think you look lovely,

67
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,020
only I would...

68
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,040
I know, keep the freaky
werewolf birthmark covered.

69
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,760
Well, I don't suspect any
of the riffraff here

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,220
would dare lay a hand on you

71
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,090
knowing that you're under the
protection of my family.

72
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,570
Still, we shouldn't take any chances.

73
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,260
All knocked up and nowhere to go.

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,140
You know...

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,230
If you wanted to attend
the festivities tonight,

76
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,340
I'd be more than willing to take you.

77
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,660
You and Klaus are barely on speaking terms.

78
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,340
Let's not rock the boat, ok?

79
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,950
Of course.

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,760
Elijah...

81
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,400
Do you mind?

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,980
Not at all.

83
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,600
Dull, dreary, hideous.

84
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,430
Talking about the clothes
or something else?

85
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,090
Why, feeling insecure?

86
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
This festival might as well be in my honor.

87
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,690
I need a proper costume, so bugger off.

88
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,810
-Bekah...  -Don't.

89
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,810
You made your choice.

90
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,290
You and Klaus are best friends again.

91
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,240
You've relinquished your right to touch me.

92
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,600
Wonder who that could be.

93
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,660
What's up?

94
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,410
Bit of an issue.

95
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,590
Seems our little bird has flown the coop.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,410
You should start to feel
it, like a weight lifting.

97
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,470
And your cheat sheets are about
to make a lot more sense.

98
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,430
I promise, as soon as the
world stops hunting me,

99
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,670
I will find the daylight ring spell.

100
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,680
I know. Just don't worry
about that right now.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,340
I remember why I wrote this.

102
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,870
I found a picture of

103
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,440
Klaus and Marcel from 1919.

104
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,090
Klaus compelled me

105
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,380
to go out with Marcel to spy on him.

106
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,170
That's what he said yesterday

107
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,310
before he told me to forget.

108
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,960
I'm remembering.

109
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,010
Let's take you back more.

110
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,900
Leave New Orleans. Forget me.

111
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,060
Put your number in Cami's phone.

112
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,700
Most of the quarter is shut down right now.

113
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,850
We'll have to walk,

114
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,140
and the sun is taking forever to go down.

115
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,880
Hey, no tears.

116
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,840
Promise you'll meet us as
soon as it gets dark out.

117
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,100
Yeah, but don't worry about me.

118
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,070
Just don't let them find you.

119
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,240
I know Klaus told you to follow me,

120
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,440
but does it really mean you have

121
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,850
to follow me to the bathroom?

122
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,630
Just give me two minutes.

123
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,400
It's my gynecologist.

124
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,820
What the hell do you want?

125
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,080
I know you don't trust me,

126
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,960
but you need to listen.

127
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,230
Everything is about to change.

128
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,590
Davina is on the loose.

129
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,260
Figured that out on your own, huh?

130
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,930
Remind me again why I should give a damn.

131
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,450
I need something from you

132
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,840
so that the witches can
complete the harvest.

133
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,010
On what planet

134
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,500
would I help you witches get more power?

135
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,620
All you've done is hex me left and right.

136
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,710
You'll help me because if we
don't complete the harvest,

137
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,270
our access to magic will fade for good,

138
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,680
which doesn't bode well for your family.

139
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,910
What do you know about my family?

140
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,110
You're from the crescent wolf bloodline.

141
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,680
Marcel forced a witch to curse them

142
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,270
so they'd be trapped in wolf form.

143
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,170
And I should keep listening

144
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,640
to you because--

145
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,680
Because my bloodline executed that curse.

146
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,540
Help me complete the harvest,

147
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,060
and I'll undo the curse for you.

148
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,230
But what can I do?

149
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,300
I need to consecrate the
remains of a powerful witch

150
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,260
so I can absorb their magic.

151
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,440
I know of one whose body was never found.

152
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,500
Her name is Celeste Dubois.

153
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,650
I believe you and she
have a friend in common.

154
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,780
Elijah.

155
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,380
Story goes that when she
died, he buried her

156
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,110
in a secret spot at her request.

157
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,440
All you need to do is find out where.

158
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,830
There's people everywhere.

159
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,760
Just keep walking. No one knows it's you.

160
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,100
Cami...

161
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,380
We have to get off this street.

162
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,320
Kieran is gonna call me
first if he hears anything.

163
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,140
Ah, you two look rather cozy.

164
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,010
Hardly. I was just telling
Elijah how we're wasting time.

165
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,780
You don't like festivals?

166
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,440
I don't see why not?

167
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,980
Who doesn't love a street fair?

168
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,100
Sister, come to help us find our stray?

169
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,440
We can't let your secret weapon

170
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,250
get in the wrong hands, can we?

171
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,300
For the record, we are moments
away from retrieving her.

172
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,030
Recognize that tone of voice, Niklaus.

173
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:19,990
Clearly, you have some
diabolical machination.

174
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,530
What is it?

175
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,160
Timothy...

176
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,090
Might I have a word?

177
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,060
Cami, hey, it's me... again...Stalking you.

178
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,930
Heh. Look. Just really need
to know where you guys are

179
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,770
so I can meet you before
the sun comes up...Again.

180
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,280
Uh, hello?

181
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,030
Joshua, my most disappointing minion,

182
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,450
I suspected you wouldn't answer the call

183
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,730
were it from me.

184
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,960
Klaus, hey, what up?

185
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,250
Guess what. I just moved to Turkey.

186
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Weirdly, they don't eat turkey here.

187
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,140
- Go figure. - You're lying.

188
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,810
In fact, Marcel and I were just chatting

189
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,540
about your failed double agent status,

190
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,840
and we've surmised that
you're likely still in town

191
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,770
and in the company of a friend--

192
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,840
A young, angry witch.

193
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Nope. Nope. No witches here.

194
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,000
Totally digging turkey, though.

195
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,580
Are you really gonna leave Davina's

196
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,720
fiddler soulmate Timothy alone with me?

197
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,890
Oh, Josh, what would she think of that?

198
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,560
I assure you, I just want to talk to her.

199
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,530
Tim and I will be at the compound.

200
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,350
I really do hope she comes home soon.

201
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,130
We should keep moving. How
long do we have to wait?

202
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,010
Give it a few minutes.

203
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,880
Then I'll check to see
if the coast is clear.

204
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,820
Josh, sorry I missed your calls.

205
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,740
What?

206
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,060
I didn't want to tell
you, but I know Klaus.

207
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,710
If Davina doesn't show up, he'll kill Tim.

208
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,570
We'll think of something.

209
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,710
Make your way to the quarter. Stay hidden.

210
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,380
We'll text you when we have a plan.

211
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,480
- I have to go. - Davina, wait.

212
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,130
I can't let Tim die.

213
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,410
What's wrong?

214
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,530
The witches.

215
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,630
Gadyen nan balans. Gadyen nan la foi.

216
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,180
Se pou nou fe sa yo dwe fe.

217
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,890
No!

218
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,940
Cami?

219
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,930
I'm just grabbing some clothes.

220
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,720
Give me two minutes, please.

221
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,490
Your brother was ill.

222
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,890
There's no reason to stay.

223
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,030
You don't have to be Sherlock
Holmes to know the obvious.

224
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,220
Our secret weapon has escaped.

225
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,820
She wouldn't just leave.

226
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,440
She knows the witches want her back.

227
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,780
Her violin is missing.

228
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,450
She may have left of her own volition.

229
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,050
What did you say to her in the attic?

230
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,990
She lied to my face so
she could stay up there

231
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,920
thinking that you'd help
her control her magic.

232
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,610
How do we know that you didn't take her?

233
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,590
I have no idea where Davina
is or why she ran away.

234
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,390
Can I suggest you take a step back?

235
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,880
I can assure you, I have
absolutely no desire

236
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,820
to see that child come into harm's way.

237
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,660
She's suffered enough with
this harvest ritual nonsense.

238
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,110
That child to whom you
refer so affectionately

239
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,850
is the most powerful witch in New Orleans.

240
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,480
If she's fled, what's to
stop her from destroying us,

241
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,080
in fact, destroying all we've worked for?

242
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,680
No. If she's not a friend to this family,

243
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,070
then she is our enemy.

244
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,340
She is a friend, Klaus.

245
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,810
Well, let's hope so.

246
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,230
Lucky for you, I know how to get her back.

247
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,770
Follow my lead.

248
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,000
You know how Niklaus operates.

249
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,160
If he perceives a threat,

250
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,790
he can become quite ruthless.

251
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,600
This would not bode well for Davina.

252
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,750
I'm not gonna let anybody
lay a finger on her.

253
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,000
Nor will I.

254
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,750
So the witch is missing, huh?

255
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,930
Walked right out the
front door, apparently.

256
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,890
Know anything about it?

257
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,860
No,

258
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,620
although I did tell her

259
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,130
that the witch elders were dead.

260
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,050
Well, why would she care when the witches

261
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,490
tried to kill her in their ritual?

262
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,300
I think it was more that
Marcel didn't tell her

263
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,150
that the one thing preventing
her from being free

264
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,470
had been eliminated.

265
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,520
So you are the reason she's run off.

266
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,830
Hey, I was just telling her the truth.

267
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,770
She's the one who realized
they were just using her

268
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,860
to keep their control over the witches.

269
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,980
Well, I've never been a
fan of the boys club.

270
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,290
Just wait. Elijah will join them,

271
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,060
and the three of them will be impossible.

272
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:22,220
Used by the witches, lied to by Marcel,

273
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,470
manipulated by Elijah,
threatened by Klaus...

274
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,140
She's like a modern-day casket girl.

275
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,810
Are you talking about Davina or yourself?

276
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,460
Does it matter?

277
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,360
Either way, us girls have
got to stick together.

278
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,970
Sorry to interrupt.

279
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,570
Been calling you for like an hour.

280
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,080
I thought you'd have taken the hint.

281
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,690
You've been acting like this
since Agnes was killed.

282
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,290
Yeah. Can you blame me?

283
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,630
It's not like I have a lot
to keep me going these days.

284
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,560
Well, while you've been
drowning your sorrows

285
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,580
by nailing everything that walks,

286
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,850
I've been doing my tours,

287
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,380
keeping my head down my ears open.

288
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,320
Marcel's daywalkers are
scouring the whole town

289
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,780
looking for a girl-- brown hair, blue eyes.

290
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,750
Sound familiar?

291
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,750
If Davina is not with Marcel,

292
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,870
he won't know if we're practicing magic.

293
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,560
And if we can actually get her back,

294
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,430
we can fix everything.

295
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,140
Sun goes down,

296
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,240
vampire search parties quadruple.

297
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
I got this from her family's old house.

298
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,440
Feel like a locator spell?

299
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,390
Keep drinking.

300
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,400
You need the vervain in your system

301
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,610
so you can't be compelled again.

302
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:12,380
Hey, Cami,

303
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,530
you don't have any human blood
in your fridge, do you?

304
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,000
For crying out loud, here.

305
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,860
Davina?

306
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,820
Someone is practicing magic.

307
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,060
They're trying to find me.

308
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,620
Then we have to run.

309
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,660
There is no way to sneak
me out of the quarter.

310
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,330
By now, everyone is looking for me--

311
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,350
The witches, Marcel, Klaus.

312
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
My uncle will know what to do.

313
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,210
- Cami...
- I mean, he has to know somewhat of

314
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,970
- what's going on in this town, right...
- Cami, stop.

315
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,890
Unless he's been compelled.

316
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,950
He knows.

317
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,490
What are you talking about?

318
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,550
He knows.

319
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,490
He works with Marcel.

320
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,840
They're practically friends.

321
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,930
I hear them talk.

322
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,990
He knows everything.

323
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,990
No.

324
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,440
He would've told me if he knew

325
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,940
the witches put a hex on my brother.

326
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,920
He knows?

327
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,690
Cami...

328
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
Oh, my god.

329
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,200
He knows.

330
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,160
Hey, you guys seriously
need to go, like now--

331
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,640
Plane, train, automobile, whatever.

332
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,760
Take my car. It's parked down at the docks.

333
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,820
I'll text you the where.

334
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,520
Celeste entrances me.

335
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:06,580
She is perfection.

336
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,420
She is dead.

337
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,050
Even as the sun rises, I see only night.

338
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,060
But for the promise I made to her

339
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,590
that in death, I would bury
her far from the mayhem

340
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,280
of witches, vampires, and men.

341
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm so sorry, Elijah.

342
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,230
Hey. It's just me. Don't, like, melt me.

343
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,990
What are you doing?

344
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,780
You're supposed to be hidden.

345
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,500
Yeah. So are you, remember,

346
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,270
but you're kind of working that
whole "girl on a mission" Look

347
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,630
that makes me nervous.

348
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,960
Are you sure that you really want to mess

349
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,220
with the baddest dude in all of history?

350
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,350
He messed with me when he took Tim.

351
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,620
I'll kill him, all of them.

352
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,850
Davina, originals can't be killed.

353
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,330
Maybe they can.

354
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,060
I have so much power,

355
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,450
I've never felt anything like it before.

356
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,560
It's growing, gathering inside me.

357
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,240
I'm strong, Josh.

358
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,750
If you kill them, then--

359
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

360
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,870
If you're gonna do it,

361
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,820
don't hold back.

362
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
You hit them with all you got.

363
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,600
That was very sweet,

364
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,240
not telling Davina that if she kills Klaus,

365
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,050
You die, too, very noble.

366
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,660
Problem is, she goes after my brother,

367
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,460
she'll be the one who ends up dead,

368
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,270
A very unnecessary end

369
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,320
to an already-tragic story.

370
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,270
Perhaps you'd like to help me help her.

371
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,770
Where's Rebekah gotten off to?

372
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,810
It's not Rebekah that I'm concerned about,

373
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,800
and how are you be so certain
that Davina will come?

374
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
One might think you've
forgotten what it's like

375
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,770
to be in the grip of an
all-consuming infatuation.

376
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,990
She'll come.

377
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,290
Are the maudlin theatrics
absolutely necessary, Niklaus?

378
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,690
Ha! It's a fair point,

379
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,050
Timothy, play something a
little more upbeat, please.

380
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,400
That's a good lad.

381
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,260
Took you long enough to spread the word.

382
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,020
Have you met his nightwalkers?

383
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,630
Not the brightest assortment.

384
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,930
All that matters is, I got it covered.

385
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,680
When Davina gets here, you two need

386
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
to let me do the talking.

387
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,460
Well, I'm sure you'll have your chance.

388
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,090
Hello, luv.

389
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,120
Silence is golden, Timothy. Thank you.

390
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,120
Davina?

391
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,030
You got me here. Now let him down.

392
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,600
Well, first, we have to have a little chat

393
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,890
about you returning to the fold.

394
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,190
What did I say, Klaus?

395
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,530
I got this. D., what happened?

396
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,260
Why'd you run? Talk to me.

397
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,660
Hey, I can make it right.

398
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,520
How, by threatening my friend?

399
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,080
Actually, that was my idea. Apologies.

400
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,250
I've been known to go too
far to make a point,

401
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,420
But I do always get results.

402
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,170
You pretend to be so confident,

403
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,380
but I know the truth.

404
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,310
you're afraid everyone can
see what you really are--

405
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,310
an animal...

406
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,400
a beast.

407
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,380
Why don't you show us your real face?

408
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,300
That's enough of you.

409
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,840
Davina, you don't have to do this.

410
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,110
You--

411
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,370
You looked me in the eyes
and lied to my face,

412
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,720
pretended you wanted to help me.

413
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,000
Listen to me.

414
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
You call yourself the noble one,

415
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,270
but you're a killer just like your brother.

416
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:19,040
For 1,000 years, you fed on innocent blood.

417
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,630
Why don't you choke on it?

418
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,460
And you--

419
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,850
I trusted you.

420
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,780
I loved you,

421
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,380
but you were just using
me to stay in power.

422
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,220
You don't care about me.

423
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,500
You're wrong.

424
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,940
When you lost to Klaus, you
handed me over like some trophy.

425
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,490
Maybe I should boil you in bronze.

426
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,890
I care.

427
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:00,130
I took you in like you were my own blood.

428
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,290
Come on now, luv.

429
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,300
Don't tell me you were falling for that.

430
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,880
Isn't it time for us girls to have a chat?

431
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,020
Now, that is impressive,

432
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,340
and well-deserved, in my opinion.

433
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,770
Now, before you turn on me,

434
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,210
I have a surprise for you.

435
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,650
Josh, what are you doing? Get out of here.

436
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,670
What are you doing?

437
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,130
Now, if I were Klaus, I would rip

438
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,330
Josh's head from his neck,
feed it to a nightwalker,

439
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:48,800
and that would be the end of your friend...

440
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,720
But hurting people is such
a boyish thing to do,

441
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,900
like how Klaus compelled
your fiddler on the roof,

442
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,990
and, while I am many things,
I'm certainly not my brother.

443
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,530
It's ok, Timothy. You can come down.

444
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,960
No one is gonna hurt you.

445
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,970
He told me I couldn't
climb down off this beam.

446
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,640
Then don't climb, silly.

447
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,430
Am I the only smart one in the room? Jump.

448
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,230
Davina, how did you do all that?

449
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,150
How did I even get here?

450
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,620
I'll explain everything, I promise.

451
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,840
Why are you doing this?

452
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,850
Seems to me that you're the
one holding all the cards,

453
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,110
but you don't know who to trust.

454
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,190
I've just proven that you can trust me.

455
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,290
Now I'd like to show you one more thing.

456
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,810
Won't take long.

457
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,910
You can bring your friends.

458
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,080
Oh, Sophie, I told you
everything that I found.

459
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,190
You said he buried her

460
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,650
between two lovely oak saplings.

461
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,310
News flash-- that was 200 years ago.

462
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,660
They're all just trees now.

463
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,080
You want to be the all-powerful
witch, keep looking.

464
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,110
Say a prayer. Have a little faith.

465
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,630
You can do this.

466
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,690
Ok.

467
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:45,230
Soeurs et freres, mwen rele sou nou.

468
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,200
Mennen me sa me chache.

469
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,900
Please, please help me.

470
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,010
I'm trying to do the right thing.

471
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,370
Oh, don't worry.

472
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:36,450
They're not really dead,
just really hungry,

473
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,080
and I'm not helping.

474
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,020
You think my brother Nik is awful?

475
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,680
Marcel learned from the best.

476
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,980
This is how he treats his so-called friends

477
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,270
who betray him.

478
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,950
Most of what these poor souls did

479
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,050
is no worse than what Josh did.

480
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,940
Take Thierry, for example.

481
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,760
He was Marcel's most trusted friend.

482
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,550
Klaus tricked him

483
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:00,570
into breaking one of Marcel's rules.

484
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,650
Marcel knows this, and yet he keeps Thierry

485
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,790
locked in here day after day suffering.

486
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:07,900
This is insane.

487
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,640
Why are you telling me this?

488
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,180
Because you need to know
who you're dealing with,

489
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,450
who you can trust.

490
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,640
Hey, hey, it's gonna be ok.

491
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,610
I mean, you're gonna be all right.

492
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,260
Here. Drink something.

493
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,660
Davina, both you and I have been lied to

494
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,350
and taken advantage of by Marcel and Klaus.

495
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,340
Maybe together, we can
get a little payback.

496
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,540
Uh, guys?

497
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,340
Tim?

498
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,530
It was Klaus. He made me do it.

499
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,740
I didn't even know what I was doing

500
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,960
until I made you--

501
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,370
Made her what?

502
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,530
Drink.

503
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,430
Tim?

504
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,830
Klaus poisoned the water.

505
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,390
Tim?

506
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,100
Davina?

507
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,030
Oh, no.

508
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,170
Cami, are you all right?

509
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,410
Did you eat today?

510
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,330
Oh, you must have fainted.

511
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,700
Yeah, or I got mystically
cold cocked by 3 witches.

512
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,320
Where's Davina?

513
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,700
Does your friend Marcel know she's here?

514
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,200
Cami, I can explain.

515
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,970
Vampires? Witches?

516
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,020
My brother, your nephew, hexed by a witch.

517
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,220
How could you not tell me?

518
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,640
It's complicated.

519
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,510
There's a lot you don't understand.

520
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,920
You hid the truth from me.

521
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,820
You let me believe that Sean was crazy,

522
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,720
that I was crazy,

523
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
instead of telling me the truth.

524
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,200
I was protecting you.

525
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,350
You saw what happened to Sean.

526
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,500
Cami, please--

527
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,720
Get the hell away from me.

528
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,020
You are every bit as bad

529
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,960
as the other monsters in this city.

530
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:37,750
Oh, isn't this monumentally awkward.

531
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,660
Rebekah, where are you?

532
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,440
I'm with Davina, and she's dying

533
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,080
because of your treachery.

534
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,180
Well, I tried to talk to her

535
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,340
out of respect for Marcel,

536
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,340
but she made it quite clear

537
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,970
she is not our friend.

538
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,810
My apologies is you thought she was yours.

539
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,340
Just tell me how to cure her.

540
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,280
Vampire blood isn't working.

541
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,680
No. It wouldn't.

542
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,830
You see, the poison I
compelled Timothy to feed her

543
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,730
is quite potent.

544
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,960
It's just a matter of time for her.

545
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,090
For both of them, you diabolical bastard.

546
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,520
They're children.

547
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,780
We could've dealt with her fairly.

548
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,500
There is no dealing with
those who threaten us.

549
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,530
Davina sealed her fate
when she stood against me.

550
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,960
This was her choice, not mine.

551
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,940
Oh, come on.

552
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,270
The stench of your
judgment is overwhelming.

553
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,880
Need I remind you that Davina
just bested the lot of us?

554
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,140
I did what had to be done.

555
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,950
Don't worry, Elijah. I remain
as redeemable as ever.

556
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,520
So you compelled that boy to poison Davina

557
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,530
without consulting Marcel or myself.

558
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,630
You know what the worst part is?

559
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,630
Is that you're so predictable,

560
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:57,410
I had to make an alliance
with your brother,

561
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,940
who I don't even like.

562
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:05,750
Judging by your expression,

563
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,450
you have something you'd like to share.

564
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:08,780
Damn straight, I do.

565
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,260
I got a call from Kieran earlier,

566
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,180
right after Sabine and some witches

567
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,100
almost got their hands on Davina first.

568
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,440
Oh, hello.

569
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,680
Let me guess, protection spell?

570
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,730
You think I'd let a day
where witches can do magic

571
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,140
pass by without one?

572
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,950
They all should've done the same.

573
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,820
You broke one of my rules, Sabine,

574
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,490
and I'm guessing that spell of yours

575
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,350
is probably a one-time deal.

576
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,300
I'll give you two choices--

577
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,800
an immediate reunion with
your dearly departed friends

578
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,760
or you can do that same spell

579
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,320
for a young witch friend of mine.

580
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,660
Yeah. You probably know which
one I'm talking about.

581
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,110
So when you slipped away to allegedly
check on your nightwalkers,

582
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,810
you were, in fact, colluding with a witch.

583
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,320
That's very clever.

584
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,550
I suppose I should be proud.

585
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,230
Eh, I just wanted to make sure

586
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,770
I had a failsafe just in case,

587
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,790
as Elijah expected, you
started acting like you.

588
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,490
Except that now you've
involved the witches,

589
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,700
who, last time I checked,

590
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,760
were enemy to us all,
to everything we have,

591
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,510
and to our family.

592
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,140
Davina is Marcel's family, Niklaus,

593
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,720
or did that somehow slip your mind

594
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,080
as you tried to take her life?

595
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,500
You will call Rebekah.

596
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,510
You'll tell her that Davina will recover.

597
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,290
Do wish the same could
be said for that boy.

598
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,490
Tim.

599
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,640
Tim? Tim?

600
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:15,020
Tim, Tim, wake up. Tim, please wake up.

601
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,680
Open your eyes. No, no.

602
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,420
Please wake up.

603
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,570
Please don't leave me alone.

604
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,350
Is she ok?

605
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,330
She's devastated and exhausted.

606
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,190
Where's her room?

607
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,930
No. I got her.

608
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,610
I got her.

609
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,100
It is said that this is a man's world,

610
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
and sometimes it is.

611
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,390
For every Casket girl that was saved,

612
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,590
countless others were not...

613
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:56,430
She'll never trust me again.

614
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,950
Perhaps.

615
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,890
You must never surrender the
fight to reclaim that trust.

616
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,410
But women are more resilient
than given credit for...

617
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:09,730
These drawings, what are they?

618
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,360
She drew those the whole
time she was in the attic,

619
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,550
said they're different than what
she draws when she senses magic.

620
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,900
These ones, she called them evil.

621
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,210
And some women, well,

622
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:32,050
let's just say, their oppressors
had better watch out.

623
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,410
Surprised to see me?

624
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,450
After all, you did compel me to leave town.

625
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,000
You remember.

626
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,720
Chalk one up for decompulsion.

627
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,730
Hurts like hell, but it's worth it,

628
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,080
Made me realize exactly why
I want to stick around,

629
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,690
Oh, and, Klaus, if you hurt Davina

630
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:02,070
or Josh in any way, I'll
expose you to the world,

631
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,100
and then you can kiss the
french quarter good-bye

632
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,860
forever.

633
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,910
Have a nice night.

634
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,640
I, too, am resilient,

635
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,630
and I'm tired of being oppressed.

636
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,700
For 1,000 years, my brother
has taken what he wants

637
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,840
in whatever way he wants,
regardless of the consequences.

638
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,780
Marcel seems determined to allow it,

639
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,910
and Elijah stands right by his side

640
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,830
futilely awaiting the
day that he'll change.

641
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,160
So men suck.

642
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,860
What do you want me to do about it?

643
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,570
Despite your dire warnings to Marcel,

644
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,570
he just can't seem to quit my brother.

645
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,930
The two of them stand side by side

646
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,860
ruling this city whilst
you're left in here to rot.

647
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,010
I want you to help me take New Orleans

648
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,400
right out from under all of their noses,

649
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,720
and I have something they won't see coming,

650
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,410
someone on the inside.

651
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:06,090
She's quite the resilient girl herself.

652
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,680
You ok?

653
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,210
I'm better now.

654
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,160
How was your day?

655
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,700
Killer.

656
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,420
What's with the artwork?

657
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,380
Davina's sketches.

658
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,960
I wonder if they represent
some kind of premonition.

659
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,750
They seem to suggest something is coming...

660
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,000
Something sinister.

661
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:22,960
Oh, my god,

662
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,270
isn't that--

663
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,480
Hello, Celeste.

664
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,550
Come on, Sophie. Pick up. Pick up.
