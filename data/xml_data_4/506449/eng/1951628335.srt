1
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,602
Elsie, what's the matter?

2
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,897
Elsie!

3
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:22,953
So, Watson.

4
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:24,162
Hmm.

5
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:31,295
You do not propose to invest
in South African securities?

6
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,257
How on earth
do you know that?

7
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,510
Now, confess, you are
utterly taken aback.

8
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,220
I am!

9
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,264
I should make you sign a paper
to that effect.

10
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:42,890
Why?

11
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:43,974
Because in a few minutes
you will say

12
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,310
it is all
so absurdly simple.

13
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,353
I should say
nothing of the kind!

14
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,898
You see, my dear Watson,
it is not really difficult

15
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,942
to construct a series
of inferences,

16
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,361
each dependent upon
its predecessor

17
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,280
and each simple in itself.

18
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:58,947
If, after doing so,

19
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,783
one simply knocks out
the central inferences

20
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,993
and presents one's audience

21
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,705
with the starting point
and the conclusion,

22
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,542
one may produce a startling,

23
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:14,463
though possibly
a meretricious, effect.

24
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:17,966
I can tell by an inspection
of the groove

25
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,344
between your
left forefinger and thumb,

26
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,596
that you have decided not
to invest your small capital

27
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,431
in the gold fields.

28
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,809
I can see no connection.

29
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,311
Very likely not;

30
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,355
but I can quickly give you
a close connection.

31
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,441
Here are the missing links
in the very simple chain:

32
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,401
You had chalk between
your forefinger and thumb

33
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,237
when you returned
from the club last night.

34
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,158
You put chalk there when you
play billiards, to ease the cue.

35
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,786
You never play billiards
except with Thurston.

36
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,622
Now, Thurston, you told me,
four weeks ago,

37
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,958
had an option on some
South African security

38
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,000
which expired in a month,

39
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,795
and which he desired you
to share with him.

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,797
Your checkbook is
locked in my drawer,

41
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,090
and you have not asked
for the key.

42
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:01,593
So, you do not propose to invest
your money in that manner.

43
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:07,516
How absurdly simple!

44
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,855
Quite so.

45
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,608
Every problem is absurdly simple
when it is explained to you.

46
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,861
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

47
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,613
Holmes, why are you
so cheerful?

48
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:24,157
You're unemployed,
you have no case to solve.

49
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:28,161
Now, normally that produces
black moods

50
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,248
and the infernal lethargy
of the cocaine bottle.

51
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:33,834
You have not used
the logical principles

52
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,253
which I constantly expound.

53
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,717
Sherlock Holmes is cheerful,

54
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:45,721
so, Sherlock Holmes
must have a case.

55
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,473
Pa!

56
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:53,896
See what you can make of that,
friend Watson.

57
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,565
Why, Holmes,
it's a child's drawing.

58
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:57,900
Ah, is that your idea?

59
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,401
Well, what else
should it be?

60
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,403
Well, that is what
a Mr. Hilton Cubitt,

61
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,948
of Ridling Thorpe Manor,
Darbyshire, is anxious to know.

62
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,576
That conundrum came
by the first post,

63
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,246
and he is to follow
by the next train.

64
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,808
Hilton Cubitt.

65
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,478
No, no, I have already
looked him up, Watson.

66
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,773
His family has owned land in
Darbyshire for over 500 years,

67
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:43,278
so I presume that Mr. Cubitt is
as respectable as he is worthy.

68
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:48,033
With a fresh face,
an open countenance,

69
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:51,245
and wearing
a brown bowler hat.

70
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh, no, you cannot
possibly know that.

71
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,207
Really, Holmes?

72
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,216
Uh, you will stay and keep
a record of the case?

73
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,594
My dear fellow.

74
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,227
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

75
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,938
This way, Mr. Cubitt.

76
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,067
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

77
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,110
Hilton Cubitt.

78
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,903
And this is my friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson.

79
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:25,904
Dr. Watson, sir.

80
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:26,613
How do you do?

81
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,990
Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

82
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,200
Thank you.

83
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,748
So, what do you make of it,
gentlemen? This thing.

84
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,334
Have you had time
to study it?

85
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,211
Absurd little figures
dancing in a line,

86
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,672
it's a childish prank.

87
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,091
Why do you attach importance
to something so trivial?

88
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,384
I don't, Mr. Holmes.

89
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,344
I--I never should.

90
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:52,181
No, it's--it's--
it's my wife, you see.

91
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,682
She--

92
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,935
Go on, Mr. Cubitt,
you're with friends.

93
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,897
But it's--it's frightened her
almost to death.

94
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,149
She says nothing,
tries to appear normal,

95
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:08,780
but I've never
seen anyone so upset.

96
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,658
In white chalk on a garden seat,
it is a precise copy?

97
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,203
Oh, it's as exact
as I could make it.

98
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,913
I did think it might be
the stable boy,

99
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,457
but the lad denied it.

100
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,792
If there's any danger
threatening my wife, Mr. Holmes,

101
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:24,713
I'd spend my last penny
to protect her.

102
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,132
Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

103
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:30,385
Do you smoke, Mr. Cubitt?

104
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:31,136
Uh, yes.

105
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,681
Uh, no, no, no,
I won't, thank you.

106
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:46,193
Tell us about your wife,
Mr. Cubitt.

107
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,239
Well, uh, I've always
lived in Darbyshire,

108
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,158
Ridling Thorpe Manor,
near Matlock.

109
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,494
I was a bachelor
and thought I'd remain one

110
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,206
until three years ago I came
down to London on a visit.

111
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,084
It's a rare thing for me, but--

112
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,879
well, I had a mind to see
the Queen's Golden Jubilee.

113
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:08,340
I put up at a boardinghouse
in Russell Square,

114
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,426
because Parker,
he's the vicar of our parish,

115
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,054
he was staying there.

116
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,058
There was also a young
American lady staying there,

117
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,478
Patrick was her name,
Elsie Patrick.

118
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,648
We were both alone,
and we became friends,

119
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,108
did the sites and that.

120
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,068
At your expense?

121
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,444
Certainly not.

122
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,237
Are you suggesting--

123
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,241
No, he's not,
Mr. Cubitt, not at all.

124
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:41,331
Was this Miss Elsie Patrick in
London merely for the Jubilee?

125
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,251
No, no, no,
she'd been here some time.

126
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,503
She'd tired of America,
traveled about,

127
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,590
and finally settled
in England.

128
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:54,761
Well, not to make a labor of it,
before my holiday was over,

129
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:59,016
I was as much in love
as any man ever has been.

130
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,476
To my surprise
and joy, she--

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,772
she reciprocated my feelings,
and we were married.

132
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:07,107
Excellent.

133
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:10,736
Quietly, in a--
in a Register Office.

134
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,614
You think I'm mad, Mr. Holmes,
taking a wife in such a fashion,

135
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,575
knowing nothing about her?

136
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:21,371
Explain, Mr. Cubitt,
and come to the point!

137
00:10:21,497 --> 00:10:29,046
Oh, uh, yes, in fact, it was
on the very day of our marriage.

138
00:10:29,171 --> 00:10:34,760
Nothing could have made me
unhappy, nothing on that day.

139
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,597
But now I look back,
it was odd.

140
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,310
Elsie?

141
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,230
There is something
I have to say to you, Hilton.

142
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,482
We don't want to be late,
my dear.

143
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,776
I've put it off till now.

144
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:55,697
But I must still give you
the chance to change your mind.

145
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:59,326
Elsie, what in the world?

146
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,662
Let me finish!

147
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,582
And what I say,
I do mean.

148
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,377
I love you dearly,

149
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:12,381
but you know nothing of my life
before we met.

150
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,883
I never asked.

151
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,763
One of the things which has
made me so fond of you.

152
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,517
If you marry me, Hilton,
I promise you marry a woman

153
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:28,272
who has nothing personally
to be ashamed of.

154
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,024
But you'll have to take
my word for it,

155
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,402
and allow me
to be silent forever

156
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,656
as to my life
before we met.

157
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,075
If that's too much to ask,

158
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,578
then you must go back
to your Darbyshire

159
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:47,082
and leave me to the lonely life
in which you found me.

160
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:53,589
It's little enough to ask,
and I shall never let you go.

161
00:11:55,591 --> 00:12:00,387
These have been the happiest
three years of my life.

162
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:02,639
And when did the first cloud

163
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:09,104
cover the sun
of this great happiness?

164
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,398
You have a way of putting
things, Mr. Holmes.

165
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,191
And you have a way

166
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,902
of prevaricating with
your answers, Mr. Cubitt.

167
00:12:17,321 --> 00:12:20,365
Well, it was, uh,
some months ago, May in fact.

168
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,121
Hilton?!

169
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:28,290
Hello!

170
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:31,668
Here, in the drawing room!

171
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,465
Well, what do you think?

172
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,093
Yes, great improvement!

173
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,182
Thank you, Saunders.

174
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:50,145
I met the postman,
saved him a journey.

175
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,774
Here's a bill.

176
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:58,445
Here's one for you,
an American stamp, Chicago.

177
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,740
Oh!

178
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,661
I hope lunch is ready,
I'm ravenous.

179
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:34,523
She burned the letter,
unopened?

180
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:38,151
Yes, I don't know why.

181
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,362
Of course you don't.

182
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,116
America is her past, and the
subject of a solemn promise.

183
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,036
Yes, but she's not had
an easy hour from that moment.

184
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,373
If only she'd trust me.

185
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:56,128
Now, I have every faith in her,
you must believe that.

186
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:00,465
Whatever there was in her past,
I'm sure it's no fault of hers.

187
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,676
And the dancing men?

188
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,721
Oh, yes,

189
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,348
well, I thought she was
getting over the letter,

190
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,684
and then these--
these drawings appeared.

191
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,853
It's just a childish scrawl,

192
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,522
but it made everything
worse than before.

193
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,358
Well, I couldn't
just leave it.

194
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,277
And it wasn't the sort of thing
I could take to the police

195
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,989
for they would have
laughed at me,

196
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,034
so I've come to you.

197
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:31,955
Don't you think,
Mr. Cubitt,

198
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,499
that your best plan would be

199
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,459
to make a direct appeal
to your wife,

200
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:38,545
and ask her to share
her secret with you?

201
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:41,840
A promise is a promise,
Mr. Holmes.

202
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,760
If Elsie wishes to tell me,
then she will.

203
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:48,263
But I have no right
to force a confidence.

204
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:54,520
However, I do feel entitled
to take my own line, and I will.

205
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:08,742
Then I will
help you with all my heart.

206
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,703
Have you seen or heard of any
strangers in the neighborhood?

207
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,205
No, no, I haven't.

208
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:14,665
Some of the farmers
take in lodgers,

209
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,168
but I've not heard
of any lately.

210
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,130
Then I suggest that you return
to Darbyshire, Mr. Cubitt,

211
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:23,799
and keep a sharp lookout.

212
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,050
And make an exact copy

213
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,594
of any fresh dancing men
that may appear.

214
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,722
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.
I will.

215
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,183
Oh, and Mr. Cubitt,

216
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,562
this letter which
started your wife's torment,

217
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,690
you are quite certain that
it was from the United States?

218
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:43,151
Yeah, the postmark was Chicago.

219
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:58,876
Goodbye!
And don't worry.

220
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,232
It's perfectly natural

221
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,693
she should receive
a letter from America,

222
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,903
she's from America.

223
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:29,364
Yes, but it is not natural to
throw it onto the fire unopened.

224
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,866
Ah.

225
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,830
It's beginning
to look like semaphore.

226
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,833
You have read my monograph
on secret ciphers?

227
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,710
Some of it.

228
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,213
I found it rather
heavy going.

229
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,757
It evidently has a meaning.

230
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:51,845
If it is purely arbitrary,
it may be impossible to solve.

231
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,725
However, if it is systematic,

232
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:00,020
we should be able to get
to the bottom of it.

233
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:04,566
But we need more messages,
and preferably long ones.

234
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,570
Well, I doubt if Hilton Cubitt
would agree with that.

235
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:51,947
Walker,

236
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,248
do you know anything
about this?

237
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:02,291
No, sir.

238
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,459
I've not been out
in the front all day.

239
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:06,253
Has Mrs. Cubitt
been out here?

240
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:11,049
I've no way of knowing,
have I, sir?

241
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,302
When I've done this,
I want you to wash it off,

242
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:16,221
and tell no one about it,
and then come to me.

243
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:20,475
I shall have an urgent letter
for you to post.

244
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,377
Elsie?

245
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:33,173
Elsie,

246
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,758
what are you doing?

247
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,760
I was looking for you.

248
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:41,640
I thought I heard the door.

249
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:47,062
Have you been out today,
out of the house?

250
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:05,622
Hilton, come to bed,

251
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:08,917
everything will look better
in the morning.

252
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,212
Will the drawings look better?!

253
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,756
Will the dancing men
look better?!

254
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,341
Why do they fuss you so?

255
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:18,051
Fuss me?!

256
00:20:18,135 --> 00:20:21,513
They're just a joke,
a bit of mischief!

257
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:34,109
The moon's high.

258
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:42,743
Where I come from, they say a
moon like that drives you crazy.

259
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,969
Why don't we travel, Hilton,
why don't we go away?

260
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:21,073
I love this place
as much as I love you.

261
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,785
Hilton--

262
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,288
What did you see?

263
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,791
Nothing, nothing at all!

264
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,918
Please, dearest.

265
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,796
Hilton, I beg you!

266
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,632
There's somebody outside.

267
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:40,634
Hilton!

268
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:43,762
Hilton, wait!

269
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:45,806
You'll come to harm!

270
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:49,852
Or are you afraid
he will come to harm?!

271
00:22:08,537 --> 00:22:10,664
These two are identical.

272
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,166
Yes.

273
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,876
Well, I had that one
washed off,

274
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,128
then it must have reappeared.

275
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:19,173
You know, it's a pity you didn't
get a closer look at this chap.

276
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,425
If only she hadn't
tried to stop me.

277
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,302
I've never been angry
with her before,

278
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,054
but she knew who was out there,
of that I'm sure.

279
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,892
And she knows
what these figures mean.

280
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,561
Was this a mere
addition to this,

281
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:35,063
or did it appear to be
entirely separate?

282
00:22:35,147 --> 00:22:38,317
That was on a separate panel
of the door.

283
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:49,745
Well, I know
what I'm going to do,

284
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,788
I shall go home,

285
00:22:51,914 --> 00:22:54,500
sit with half a dozen of my lads
in the shrubbery,

286
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:55,292
and if this fellow
calls again,

287
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:58,045
give him such a thrashing he'll
leave us alone in the future.

288
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,671
Well, that would
be one way.

289
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:07,429
Mr. Cubitt, this case is too
deep for such a simple remedy.

290
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,599
I must go now
if I'm to catch my train.

291
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,434
I'd not leave
Elsie alone at night.

292
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,268
Elsie!

293
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,645
Quite right.

294
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,189
Good day, Mr. Cubitt.

295
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:20,776
We will join you in a couple
of days, and be patient!

296
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:22,069
Good bye, Dr. Watson.

297
00:23:22,194 --> 00:23:23,612
I'll find my own way.

298
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,572
Bye.

299
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,245
You weren't
exactly sympathetic.

300
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,581
He doesn't come to me
for sympathy.

301
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,972
It is a considerable challenge.

302
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,100
I shall work better
for silence.

303
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,768
Oh, well,

304
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:59,314
I dare say I can find
something quiet to do.

305
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,982
Whoa, sit.

306
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:43,025
Where did you find this?

307
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,360
Down by the garden bench.

308
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,320
Will that, uh, mean

309
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:51,325
you'll be wanting me to take
another letter for London, sir?

310
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,494
Very well.

311
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,788
I'll have to get a move on if
I'm gonna catch the last post.

312
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,043
Walker, just do
what you're told!

313
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,677
Yes, Watson?

314
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:15,015
Uh, I thought you
might like the Times, Holmes.

315
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,810
What do you make
of my progress?

316
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,939
Well, it still
doesn't mean very much, does it?

317
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:26,527
Quite enough for me to send
a telegram to the United States.

318
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:29,738
What on earth does
that mean, "ABESLANE"?

319
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:34,701
Watson, if this is E,

320
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:37,371
flag denotes
the end of words.

321
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:33,927
Mm, this grouse is superb.

322
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:40,017
Mrs. Hudson has really surpassed
herself this time.

323
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:43,270
What time is the last train
to Matlock?

324
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,189
I'm afraid we've missed it.

325
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:53,614
Holmes, I do wish
you would try and eat a bite.

326
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:58,202
I just need an answer
to my telegram from America,

327
00:26:58,327 --> 00:27:00,954
and the story is complete.

328
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,928
Abe, I wanna stay,
and I'm going to stay.

329
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,639
What about your
friends in Chicago?

330
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,600
What about your family?!

331
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,310
Friends do you call them;

332
00:28:46,435 --> 00:28:50,397
killers, robbers,
extortionists, some family.

333
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,649
But you and I
were engaged!

334
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:56,361
I'm sorry, Abe,
my father forced me into it.

335
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:59,448
How could I be happy
with you in that life?!

336
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:07,748
Please go away,
please, I beg you.

337
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,583
You beg me?!

338
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,460
Yes.

339
00:29:11,585 --> 00:29:12,628
Hilton is
such a good man.

340
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:17,424
It would break my heart
if scandal ever touched him.

341
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:20,427
Here's money,

342
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,346
it's all that I have.

343
00:29:34,775 --> 00:29:35,567
No!

344
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:36,235
You're coming home!

345
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:36,818
No!

346
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:37,402
You're coming home!

347
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:38,278
No!

348
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,697
What the--

349
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:41,698
No!!

350
00:29:47,746 --> 00:29:49,122
Watson?

351
00:29:51,542 --> 00:29:54,002
What the devil is going on?

352
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:57,089
An answer to your telegram?

353
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,801
No, it's another letter
from Hilton Cubitt.

354
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:12,354
"ELSIE

355
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,357
PRE-P ARE."

356
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,462
Mr. Holmes, sir.

357
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,631
Thank you.

358
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:46,096
It's from Wilson Hargreave,
of the Chicago Police Bureau.

359
00:30:46,221 --> 00:30:47,181
"In reply to your inquiry,

360
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:49,933
Abe Slaney is one of the most
dangerous men in Chicago."

361
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,355
Come along, come along.

362
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,236
There's a cab!

363
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:02,738
Ridling Thorpe Manor,
gentlemen?

364
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,740
As fast as you can!

365
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,160
How do you know?

366
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,829
Bet you're the surgeon
from London, sir.

367
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,164
I beg your pardon,
what makes you--

368
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:13,624
She's not dead yet, sir.

369
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:18,462
You may be able to save her,
but she's for the gallows.

370
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,005
The gallows?!

371
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:23,467
Right, sir,
she murdered her husband.

372
00:31:55,374 --> 00:31:59,211
Inspector of Police, and Doctor
of Medicine, I perceive?

373
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,923
Yes, indeed, Inspector Martin,
Darbyshire Constabulary.

374
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,801
And I am Dr. Carthew,
the surgeon.

375
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:06,885
This way, gentlemen.

376
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,721
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

377
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:14,268
and I am his friend
and colleague, Dr. Watson.

378
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:21,358
Mr. Holmes, but what do you know
of this business?!

379
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,735
A good deal.

380
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:27,739
Mr. Hilton Cubitt
was my client.

381
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:30,951
But the crime was only committed
at 3:00 o'clock this morning.

382
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:32,244
How could you hear of it
in London

383
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,787
and get to the spot
as soon as I?

384
00:32:33,871 --> 00:32:35,289
I anticipated it.

385
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:40,085
We came in hope
of preventing it.

386
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,295
Then you must have
important evidence

387
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,963
of which I am ignorant.

388
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:45,382
Only the evidence
of the dancing men.

389
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:46,091
The dancing men?

390
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:49,178
I will explain
all that to you later.

391
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,141
Since we are too late
to prevent this tragedy,

392
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,436
I am anxious to insure
that justice is done.

393
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,438
Will you associate me
in your investigation,

394
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,982
or will you prefer that
I should act independently?

395
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:06,320
I should be proud for us
to work together, Mr. Holmes.

396
00:33:06,445 --> 00:33:09,573
But I must warn you, there seems
very little to investigate.

397
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:14,036
Mr. Hilton Cubitt has been shot
through the heart and he's dead.

398
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:20,042
And Mrs. Cubitt?

399
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,628
Seriously wounded.

400
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:24,463
The bullet passed through
the front of her brain,

401
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:27,049
and she's still unconscious.

402
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:29,384
Excuse me, gentlemen.

403
00:33:30,928 --> 00:33:34,973
Only one gun has been found,
lying on the floor between them.

404
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:37,142
Two bullets have been fired.

405
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,268
With respect, Mr. Holmes,

406
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,104
it seems quite clear that
Mrs. Cubitt murdered her husband

407
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,607
and then turned the gun
upon herself.

408
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:47,110
But they were
a most devoted couple!

409
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:49,363
The murder room is through here,
Mr. Holmes.

410
00:33:49,488 --> 00:33:54,409
No, I would like to start
by interviewing the servants.

411
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:55,327
And I beg you, nothing,

412
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,789
absolutely nothing
is to be moved.

413
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:05,546
Is this the way
to the kitchen?

414
00:34:10,551 --> 00:34:12,553
I should think it must
have happened about

415
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:16,682
3:00 o'clock
in the morning, sir.

416
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:18,308
Where are your rooms?

417
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,101
On top, sir.

418
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:20,352
The attics!

419
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:22,729
I was awoke
by this terrible bang,

420
00:34:22,813 --> 00:34:25,732
an explosion
is the only word.

421
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:26,984
And about a minute later--

422
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,651
It was less than a minute.

423
00:34:27,776 --> 00:34:31,405
--there was another bang,
only not so loud.

424
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:33,073
What did you do?

425
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:34,783
We came downstairs, sir,

426
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,910
expecting to find
Mr. Cubitt up and about,

427
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,913
chasing burglars or
the house on fire, or--

428
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,957
And the bedroom door was open.

429
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:45,586
We looked in but the bed
was empty so we came on down.

430
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:46,420
There was smoke,

431
00:34:46,545 --> 00:34:48,338
and the smell
was worse down here.

432
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,591
Smell?

433
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,509
Ah, you mean
of the gunpowder?

434
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,596
I suppose it was, sir, yes.

435
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,431
Now, you say the smell
was worse downstairs.

436
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,683
Could you also smell
gunpowder upstairs?

437
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,602
Yes, sir.

438
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:02,436
I commend that fact

439
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,272
very carefully to your
attention, Inspector.

440
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,441
Mrs. King,

441
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:14,823
would you like to sit down,
Mrs. King?

442
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:22,080
Now, was the library door
open when you reached it?

443
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:24,249
Open, yes, sir.

444
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:28,045
We could see the candle alight
on the table and so we came in.

445
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,049
Then, oh dear,

446
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:36,470
as terrible a thing as
ever I saw or ever fear to see.

447
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,223
She was terrible
wounded, sir.

448
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:41,391
She was moaning and groaning,

449
00:35:41,517 --> 00:35:43,268
then she sort of
collapsed on the floor

450
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:46,772
and she hasn't said
anything since.

451
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:49,816
Saunders?

452
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,860
We moved her
to her bedroom, sir,

453
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:55,197
and sent Fred Walker for
the doctor and the police.

454
00:35:56,365 --> 00:36:01,829
And there was no sign of
a break-in, or of an intruder?

455
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:02,996
No, sir.

456
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,748
And all the doors
and windows was locked,

457
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:07,960
as we had left them
when we went to bed.

458
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,880
Inspector...

459
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,383
Oh, yes...

460
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:19,304
Apart from poor Mrs. Cubitt,

461
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,139
nothing else
has been moved?

462
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:22,015
No, sir.

463
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,894
No, we've touched nothing,
Mr. Holmes.

464
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:29,022
Thank you.
Then I think we can proceed.

465
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:39,283
Almost instantaneous death,
presumably.

466
00:36:39,408 --> 00:36:42,870
Mm, straight
through the heart.

467
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:47,291
The bullet's still there.

468
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:50,711
What about the bullet
that wounded Mrs. Cubitt?

469
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:53,005
That's still in her, as well.

470
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:57,092
It will take hands more nimble
than mine to move it.

471
00:36:59,052 --> 00:37:01,430
Is this Mrs. Cubitt's handbag?

472
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:04,266
Yes, it is, Mr. Holmes.

473
00:37:04,391 --> 00:37:08,145
At least twenty
50-pound notes,

474
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,690
a bribe that failed.

475
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:18,530
So, two bullets fired,

476
00:37:18,614 --> 00:37:20,407
two wounds inflicted,
as you said.

477
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,617
Yes, Doctor.

478
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:22,951
Then how do you account
for the bullet

479
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:28,499
that has so obviously
struck the window frame?

480
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:32,628
By George,
however did you see that?!

481
00:37:32,753 --> 00:37:36,381
Because, Dr. Carthew,
I looked for it.

482
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,760
Wonderful, why,
the bullet's still there!

483
00:37:39,885 --> 00:37:42,763
So a third shot
must have been fired.

484
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,974
Which means that a third person
must have been present.

485
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:48,185
Exactly!

486
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,770
When you came into
this room last night,

487
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:54,066
you say that the door was ajar;
was not that window also open?

488
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,776
I don't know, sir.

489
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:56,944
No, sir.

490
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,779
It was shut.

491
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,282
Saunders, will you and Cook
wait in the library,

492
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:05,077
and you, Walker.

493
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:10,666
Dr. Carthew,
you may remove the body.

494
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:22,469
It was Mrs. Cubitt herself
who shut that window.

495
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:28,559
If Saunders and the Cook smelled
smoke and gunpowder upstairs,

496
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:33,397
then there must have been
a strong through draft.

497
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,190
Otherwise, it would not
have spread so quickly

498
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,483
through the house.

499
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:40,028
We know that door was open,

500
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,114
that window, too,
must also have been open,

501
00:38:42,197 --> 00:38:43,991
but only for a short time.

502
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,119
Why only for a short time?

503
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:50,205
Because the candles
have not gutted.

504
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:52,833
There is
no trail of wax.

505
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:56,253
Wonderful, wonderful!

506
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:01,216
If the late Mr. Hilton Cubitt

507
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:06,138
fired the bullet which
pierced the window frame,

508
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,015
he must have been
aiming at

509
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,352
someone who was
standing either inside

510
00:39:12,477 --> 00:39:14,188
or just outside the window.

511
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:15,731
Oh, thank you, Inspector.

512
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,025
Which means that the bullet
which killed Mr. Cubitt

513
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,234
could have been fired by--

514
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,655
Inspector, your thoughts
and mine agree entirely.

515
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,513
This is the cartridge case

516
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:53,310
of the bullet which killed
Mr. Hilton Cubitt.

517
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:05,072
Holmes,

518
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,615
if three shots were fired,

519
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,703
why did Mrs. King and Saunders
only hear two shots?

520
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,874
They were telling the truth,
but lied without realizing it.

521
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:18,961
I'm not sure
that I follow you.

522
00:40:19,086 --> 00:40:22,756
You remember
what Mrs. King said,

523
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:28,595
"I was awoken by this
terrible bang, an explosion,

524
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,429
it is the only word.

525
00:40:29,555 --> 00:40:30,472
And then a minute later

526
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:34,685
there was another bang
but not so loud."

527
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:41,441
The first bang was two shots,
fired almost simultaneously;

528
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,069
one from the window,
which killed Hilton Cubitt,

529
00:40:44,153 --> 00:40:45,445
and one from Hilton Cubitt,

530
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,574
which missed and went
into the window frame.

531
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:54,163
And the third shot?

532
00:40:54,288 --> 00:41:00,085
The saddest of all,
Mrs. Cubitt,

533
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:03,922
self-administered
in her despair.

534
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:12,723
Now, do any of you know of
an inn in the neighborhood

535
00:41:12,848 --> 00:41:16,977
called Elrige's?

536
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:23,817
There's a farmer of that name,
lives some miles off,

537
00:41:23,942 --> 00:41:27,070
in the direction of,
uh, Milbrook.

538
00:41:27,196 --> 00:41:28,822
Is it a lonely farm?

539
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:30,908
Very lonely, sir.

540
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:32,242
Then it is just possible

541
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,827
that the news of what happened
here last night

542
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,496
has not reached them.

543
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:37,372
Maybe not, sir.

544
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:39,166
Excellent!

545
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:42,002
Walker,

546
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,295
I want you
to take this note

547
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:47,257
to a Mr. Abe Slaney
of Elrige's Farm.

548
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,885
Do not say that
the note is from me,

549
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,054
and make no mention of
what happened here last night.

550
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,264
Now, you understand?

551
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,808
Yes, sir.

552
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,937
Thank you, Walker.

553
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:08,445
I am expecting a visitor
in answer to my note.

554
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:12,366
Now, Saunders, he will
ask for Mrs. Cubitt.

555
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:15,410
I want you to show him
into this room.

556
00:42:15,494 --> 00:42:18,080
I want this house
to look quite normal,

557
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:22,584
and you must not give anything
away of what has happened.

558
00:42:22,668 --> 00:42:24,837
Very good, sir.

559
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,048
Now, I suggest you return
to your duties.

560
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:32,386
And, Dr. Carthew, I suggest
you return to your patient.

561
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:37,057
Oh, Mrs. King,

562
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,270
your mistress
is quite innocent.

563
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:06,962
But how did
you break the code?

564
00:43:07,045 --> 00:43:09,173
Well, you see,

565
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:13,802
the rules which guide us in
deciphering all secret writing

566
00:43:13,927 --> 00:43:15,596
depend on the fact that E,

567
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:21,435
E is the most common letter
in the English language.

568
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,061
So, you see,
we were very fortunate

569
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:26,565
that Mrs. Cubitt's name
was Elsie,

570
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:28,233
and that it featured
in the second message,

571
00:43:28,317 --> 00:43:34,781
which gave us not only the E,
but the L, the S and the I.

572
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,284
Now, next,
it seemed likely to us

573
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,621
that two of the messages
were appeals of some sort

574
00:43:40,746 --> 00:43:43,165
to Mrs. Cubitt...

575
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,517
...by adding the T and the G,
the message reads:

576
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:07,314
"AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

577
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,151
Well, if this Abe Slaney
is indeed the murderer,

578
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,362
we must make an immediate move
to arrest him.

579
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,530
Calm yourself, Inspector.

580
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,824
I expect him here
at any moment.

581
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,492
But why should
Slaney come here?

582
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,619
Because I have written
and asked him.

583
00:44:20,702 --> 00:44:22,871
But won't his
suspicions be roused?

584
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:24,289
Will he not try to escape?

585
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:25,374
Saunders?

586
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:29,211
Excuse me, sir, there's a
gentleman approaching the house.

587
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,423
Do you think he'd be armed?

588
00:44:33,549 --> 00:44:36,176
He's a fool if he's not.

589
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:51,859
Good day, sir.

590
00:44:51,942 --> 00:44:53,485
Is Mrs. Cubitt at home?

591
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:57,281
I'll inquire, sir,
if you'll step inside.

592
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:07,374
What name shall I say?

593
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:10,127
Tell her it's an old friend.
She's expecting me.

594
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,005
If you'll wait
in the library a moment.

595
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:32,608
Well, gentlemen, it looks like
you've got the drop on me,

596
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:35,027
but what the hell
is going on?

597
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:37,237
Abe Slaney, I believe.

598
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:38,864
What if I am,
and who are you, anyway?

599
00:45:38,947 --> 00:45:40,199
My name would mean
nothing to you,

600
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:42,201
though I suspect
that of Wilson Hargreave

601
00:45:42,284 --> 00:45:45,162
of the Chicago Police
Department, will.

602
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,583
Ah, I see that it does.

603
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:55,964
Mr. Slaney,
you should know

604
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:01,470
that Mrs. Elsie Cubitt
is very seriously ill.

605
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:03,597
I don't believe you.

606
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:06,225
This is some cheap trick.

607
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,811
Mrs. Elsie Cubitt wrote me
a note just an hour ago,

608
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,939
a note that only
I can understand.

609
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:16,401
What one man can invent,
another can discover:

610
00:46:17,152 --> 00:46:23,951
"I'M HERE, ABE SLANEY.
AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

611
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:25,494
And your last note to her:

612
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,748
"ELSIE PREPARE
TO MEET THY GOD."

613
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,418
And this.

614
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:36,505
You wrote that note?

615
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,840
But you were lying about Elsie.

616
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:41,093
Slaney, when you shot and killed
Hilton Cubitt,

617
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:45,305
Elsie Cubitt, in her despair,
attempted to kill herself,

618
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:46,557
and is now
at death's door.

619
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:47,850
No.

620
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:49,810
No, I gotta see her!!

621
00:46:49,893 --> 00:46:52,479
I gotta see her, I love her,
for God's sake, Elsie!!

622
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:54,481
I love you, Elsie!!

623
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:56,817
Elsie, Elsie!!

624
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:00,362
I believe that she fled
from America to avoid you.

625
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:02,906
Because you followed her
and made her life a misery,

626
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,575
she now lies
under grave suspicion

627
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,035
of murdering the husband
she loved.

628
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:11,748
The least you can do
is to clear her of that.

629
00:47:14,376 --> 00:47:17,421
I guess the very best case
I can make for myself now

630
00:47:17,546 --> 00:47:20,841
is to tell you
the absolute, naked truth.

631
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,134
It is my duty to warn you

632
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:26,597
that it will be
used against you.

633
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:27,681
I guess you probably know

634
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:31,143
that Elsie's father's the most
powerful man in Chicago.

635
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:35,856
One of the most powerful
criminal men in Chicago.

636
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:39,109
It was he who invented
the dancing men.

637
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,487
We used it as a code
in the old days.

638
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,405
I've known Elsie
since she was a child.

639
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,282
She was promised to me.

640
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,450
I may have threatened her,

641
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:50,996
but I wouldn't have touched
a hair on her pretty head.

642
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:55,709
But you're right, she hated
the whole Chicago business.

643
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:58,879
That's why she ran away
to Europe.

644
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:01,924
It was only after her marriage
to this Englishman

645
00:48:02,007 --> 00:48:04,218
that I was able
to find out where she was.

646
00:48:04,343 --> 00:48:08,388
I wrote to her,
but I got no answer.

647
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:10,807
She burned your letter.

648
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:15,854
She was happy in her
new life in Darbyshire.

649
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:20,234
I came here to England
to take her home!

650
00:48:20,317 --> 00:48:22,069
I sent her notes.

651
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:24,613
I did everything I could
to coax Elsie away,

652
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:29,284
then my temper got the better of
me and I began to threaten her.

653
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,121
But yesterday
she sent me a letter!

654
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,916
She said she would come down
when her husband was asleep

655
00:48:35,999 --> 00:48:39,378
and speak to me
through the end window

656
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:44,967
if I would go away afterwards
and leave her in peace.

657
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:51,723
Can I make you see?

658
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:55,310
I've never been so happy
as I've been here with him.

659
00:48:55,435 --> 00:48:57,521
I love him.

660
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,819
Abe, I wanna stay,
and I'm going to stay.

661
00:49:03,944 --> 00:49:06,238
What about your
friends in Chicago?

662
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:08,198
What about your family?!

663
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:09,825
Friends do you call them;

664
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,954
killers, robbers,
extortionists, some family.

665
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,290
But you and I
were engaged!

666
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:19,084
I'm sorry, Abe,
my father forced me into it.

667
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:25,465
How could I be happy
with you in that life?!

668
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:31,180
Please go away,
please, I beg you.

669
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:32,973
You beg me?!

670
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,017
Yes.

671
00:49:35,142 --> 00:49:36,143
Hilton is
such a good man.

672
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:39,563
It would break my heart
if scandal ever touched him.

673
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:44,526
Here's money,

674
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:46,820
it's all that I have.

675
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:51,492
Now, please go away.

676
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:54,161
No!

677
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:54,870
You're coming home!

678
00:49:54,995 --> 00:49:55,496
No!

679
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:56,163
You're coming home!

680
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:56,914
No!

681
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:58,999
What the--

682
00:50:05,088 --> 00:50:06,673
No!!

683
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:26,503
I think we've heard enough
for the moment, come along.

684
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:28,589
Can't I see her before I go?

685
00:51:28,714 --> 00:51:31,133
Nobody can see her,

686
00:51:31,258 --> 00:51:35,637
even we have not
been given that privilege.

687
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:44,646
Mr. Holmes,

688
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:47,691
I hope that if ever again
I have an important case,

689
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:51,612
I shall have the good fortune
to have you by my side.

690
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:55,282
Good afternoon,
and thank you.

691
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:00,162
Holmes?

692
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:01,455
Hmm.

693
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:04,583
What did you write
in that note?

694
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,961
See if you could read it.

695
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:22,142
"COME-HERE-AT-ONCE,"

696
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:25,312
"COME HERE AT ONCE."

697
00:52:25,395 --> 00:52:29,441
How absurdly simple.

698
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,944
And so the dancing men,

699
00:52:32,027 --> 00:52:34,154
which had so often been
the agents of evil,

700
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:37,241
were finally used
on the side of justice.

701
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:40,369
Abe Slaney was condemned
to death at the Darby assizes,

702
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,663
but his sentence was
changed to penal servitude

703
00:52:42,788 --> 00:52:45,833
in consideration of
mitigating circumstances

704
00:52:45,958 --> 00:52:51,380
in the certainty that Hilton
Cubitt had fired the first shot.

705
00:52:51,463 --> 00:52:53,966
Mrs. Cubitt made
a complete recovery,

706
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:58,971
and lives still
at Ridling Thorpe Manor.
