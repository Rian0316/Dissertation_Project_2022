1
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:04,478
来个纸杯蛋糕吗?
Care for a cupcake?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,564
我们的新的室外座位区
Well, our new outdoor seating area

3
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:10,067
就如保拉・迪恩在NBA现场一样倍受冷落
is about as popular as Paula Deen at an NBA game.

4
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:10,067
{\an8}保拉・迪恩: 美国明星厨师

5
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:14,572
我们还要在这里坐多久?
How much longer do we have to be out here?

6
00:00:14,574 --> 00:00:16,123
我们好冷
We are cold.

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,826
超级冷
So, so cold.

8
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:20,661
我都能看到呼出的空气
I can see my breath.

9
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,080
我的鸡鸡冻得戳到胸口了
And my boys are up by my rib cage.

10
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:27,651
我都能闻到他的口臭
I can smell his breath.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,172
我的鸡鸡被冻得跟年轻时一样硬了
And my boys are up by where my boys used to be.

12
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:36,177
这些顾客根本帮不上忙
And these customers aren't helping.

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,345
我们怎么会以为Han坐在门口
How could we have thought a strong Han presence

14
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,264
能增加蛋糕销量的?
would make it more popular?

15
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,899
Max 我就说了吧
Max, in hindsight,

16
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:44,685
不重新花钱去买取暖灯
it feels like us not springing for those heat lamps

17
00:00:44,687 --> 00:00:46,020
是个错误的决定
was a bad call.

18
00:00:46,022 --> 00:00:48,272
是你自己觉得吧?
Uh, you think?

19
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:52,159
各位 为了保暖 我刚撒了点尿
Guys, I just peed a little to keep warm.

20
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:58,165
我也撒了点尿
Well, I peed a little

21
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,151
因为我没办法了
'cause I had no choice.

22
00:01:02,505 --> 00:01:04,505
好吧 他们黏在长椅上了
Great, they're stuck to the bench.

23
00:01:07,043 --> 00:01:09,293
去把挡风玻璃铲拿过来
Go get the windshield scraper.

24
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:14,193
破产姐妹花 第四季第10集

你在看"我们"周刊吗 Earl?
Reading Us Weekly, Earl?

28
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,922
噢 "明星 和平凡人一样"
Ooh, "Stars. They're just like us."

29
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,808
如果他们真和我们一样 那怎么没有
Well, if they're just like us, where's the picture

30
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,876
他们把内裤翻过来重复穿的照片?
of them turning their underwear inside out?

31
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:41,516
Caroline把这个留在了男厕所里
Caroline left it in the men's room.

32
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,902
当我把这话说出来时
And as I said that out loud,

33
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,905
我就意识到我肯定是错入了女厕所
I realized that I must have been in the ladies' room.

34
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:50,442
我眼睛不好 Max
I can't see, Max.

35
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,412
Max 我有个让人兴奋消息!
Max, I've got some exciting news!

36
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,332
我发过誓 在看过最后一部"夺宝奇兵"之后
Eh, I vowed I'd never get excited about anything again

37
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,785
我不会再为任何事兴奋了
after that last Indiana Jones.

38
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,088
我在"雪丽清单"网上找到了两盏折扣取暖灯
I found us two discount heat lamps on Sherry's list.

39
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,373
它和分类广告网相似 但降低了
It's like Craigslist, but without the high probability

40
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,426
被某个疯狂医学生杀掉的风险
of being murdered by a deranged medical student.

41
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,212
那些取暖灯?
And about those lamps?

42
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,847
才不要
Uh, no.

43
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,465
我们不必再担心室外生意啦
We can't worry about our outdoor business.

44
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,517
因为店里都快没生意了
We barely have an indoor business.

45
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,886
照你这个态度 我们再也不会有生意了
And we never will, with that attitude.

46
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,855
我再求你一次:
I'm gonna ask you one more time:

47
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:22,057
拜托去听听我们在垃圾里找到的
please listen to those Tony Robbins tapes

48
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,860
托尼・罗宾斯的励志磁带吧
we found in the garbage.

49
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:26,528
姑娘们
Well, girls,

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,363
明天就是我盼了三年的
tomorrow's the day I've been looking forward to

51
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,564
大好日子
for three years.

52
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,068
你要去洗牙了吗?
You're getting your teeth cleaned?

53
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,537
抱歉 那是我们盼望着的事情
Sorry, that's what's we've been looking forward to.

54
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,405
我要搬去和Sophie同居
I'm moving in with Sophie.

55
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:42,577
从现在开始 不出家门我也能上辣妹了
From now on, the booty call is coming from inside the house.

56
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:45,080
我只是无意听到的
I couldn't help but overhear.

57
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,548
这么远都能听到?
From way back there?

58
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,669
你的耳朵真该给你的全身做个身残志坚的演讲
Your ears should give a pep talk to the other parts of your body.

59
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,588
Oleg 如果你搬家需要帮手的话
And, Oleg, if you need any help with the move,

60
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,674
我可以去帮你忙吗?
might I offer my services?

61
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,010
我的教练Skylar说我有肌肉了
My trainer Skylar says I'm getting ripped.

62
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,063
是啊 你是Skylar给坑了吧
Yeah, ripped off by Skylar.

63
00:03:02,065 --> 00:03:03,331
谢了 Han
Thanks, Han.

64
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:04,983
作为小小的回报
And as a bit of a payback,

65
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:08,019
我今晚回来时会洗手的
I'll wash my hands back here tonight.

66
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,323
一会儿见 邻居们
See you later, neighbors.

67
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:12,607
Oleg要搬过来?
Oleg's moving in?

68
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,609
这是我遇上最糟糕的事情
This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

69
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,912
比损失了20亿还糟糕
And I lost $2 billion.

70
00:03:16,914 --> 00:03:20,081
有什么问题? 这都是好消息
What is the problem? This is all good news.

71
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,117
Sophie和Oleg相爱了
Sophie and Oleg are in love.

72
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,201
没错!
Yeah!

73
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,603
他们就会在我们的楼梯上
And they'll be in love

74
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,588
在我们的大厅里
on our stairs,

75
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,590
在洗衣房
in our hallway,

76
00:03:28,592 --> 00:03:31,593
所有的平面上相亲相爱
and on every surface of the laundry room.

77
00:03:31,595 --> 00:03:35,046
再说 你懂什么爱 单身"相亲"汉?
What do you know about love anyway, Christian Single?

78
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:38,800
我知道上帝为我准备了妹子
I know Jesus has a girl for me.

79
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,051
他必须准备
He has to.

80
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,938
我在相亲网上花了400刀
I'm $400 deep into that damn website.

81
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,775
听着 我们必须制定条约
Look, we just make a pact

82
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,560
无论楼上 楼梯上
that no matter what happens upstairs,

83
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,929
还是洗衣房里发生了什么事
or on the stairs or in the laundry room,

84
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,814
绝对不能让他们进我们的公寓
we don't invite it into our apartment.

85
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,649
各位好!
Hey, everybody!

86
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:04,125
外面在下倾盆大羊
It's raining cats and goats out there.

87
00:04:04,127 --> 00:04:06,711
你是想说"倾盆大雨"吗?
Don't you mean "cats and dogs"?

88
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:10,131
一走进门就被纠正错误的感觉真好
Oh, it's so nice to be corrected as you walk in the door.

89
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,634
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

90
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:16,221
你能相信24小时内 我们就要活在罪恶里吗?
Can you believe in 24 hours we'll be living in sin?

91
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,422
别担心
Oh, don't worry.

92
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,175
我父母不知道
My parents don't know.

93
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,428
我明晚要开个晚宴来庆祝
I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night to celebrate.

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,481
还有个原因 我有15磅牛肉
And also because I have 15 pounds of beef

95
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,984
快要变质了
that's about to go bad.

96
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:30,835
Max Caroline 你们来吗?
So, Max, Caroline, are you in?

97
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,153
Sophie 其实我们很忙...
Actually, Sophie, we're busy...

98
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:34,322
我们会去的
We'll be there.

99
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,241
只要有牛肉 我就会去
If there's beef involved, I'm involved.

100
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,195
你忘了我们刚才制定的条约吗?
What happened to the pact we just made?

101
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,529
我真不愿告诉你...
I hate to tell you this...

102
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,949
要在你和牛肉间选的话
if it comes down to you or beef,

103
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,667
我永远会选牛肉
I'm always going beef.

104
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,296
是"雪丽清单"的雪丽发来的
That was Sherry from Sherry's list.

105
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,964
她非要我那么叫她
She makes you call her that.

106
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,916
她说如果我们能自己去提货
She said she's consider charging us $150

107
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:03,902
她可以考虑取暖灯只收我们150刀
if we pick up the heat lamps themselves.

108
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,221
你打扰了我看"坐劣质高脚凳的婴儿"视频
And I'm charging you with three counts of interrupting

109
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,139
我要罚你三倍的金额
this "Baby in a Faulty High Chair" video.

110
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,727
有人摔倒了!
Someone fell in real life!

111
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,265
你说在你手上的
You told me you had it.

112
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,267
我说了我没拿
I said I didn't have it.

113
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:21,486
是Oleg和Han在搬家
It's Oleg and Han moving in.

114
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,021
离门远点!
Get away from the door!

115
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,606
Han能从门缝里看到你的脚
Han will see your feet under the door.

116
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:26,608
这正对他的视平线啊
They're right at his eye level.

117
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,912
简直就是恐怖片... 电锯惊魂3
This is like a horror movie... Saw III.

118
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:32,447
因为Han弯腰的时候
Because when Han bent over,

119
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,949
我看到他露出的3英寸屁股沟
I saw 3 inches of his crack.

120
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,086
所以你啥都看到了?
So you saw his whole crack?

121
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,755
后退!
Step away!

122
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,290
开门 Max
Open the door, Max.

123
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,608
我要杀了Han
I'm about to kill Han,

124
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,293
我知道你想看的
and I know you're gonna want to see that.

125
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:47,178
该死! 他说得对
Damn it! He's right.

126
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,885
这服装挺可爱的 Han
Cute outfit, Han.

127
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,637
穿的和"雷霆猛男"里面的
Like one of those male strippers

128
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,722
脱衣舞男一样
from "No Thunder From Down Under."

129
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,192
这箱子太重了
This is so heavy.

130
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,144
Oleg 你这里面装了什么呀?
Oleg, what do you have in here?

131
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:04,979
袜子!
Socks!

132
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,815
不是吧 Han
Really, Han,

133
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:10,568
你的两条胳膊只是用来装饰的啊
It's like your arms are only there for decoration.

134
00:06:12,489 --> 00:06:14,038
公平来说 Oleg的袜子里
To be fair, Oleg's socks

135
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,292
也许装着他千千万万的子孙后代
probably have some pretty heavy loads in them.

136
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,962
Oleg 你把你的垃圾都堆这干嘛?
Oleg, what is all your junk doing out here?

137
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,498
我确实是听到妹子的尖叫声了吗
Do I actually smell girls screaming?

138
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,135
我把东西搬上去 Sophie说了句"我不要"
I bring things up, Sophie says "No,"

139
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,970
我就得把这些东西都搬回去
I bring them right back down.

140
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,005
这烂楼里就没个电梯吗?
Is there no elevator up in this bitch?

141
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,093
Oleg 你忘了你的画
Oleg, you forgot your painting,

142
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,562
这也是明确被拒绝的东西之一
and this one's a definite "No."

143
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,897
Sophie 我还没听到你说一句"我要"呢
Sophie, I haven't gotten a "Yes" yet,

144
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,568
除了咱俩在厕所洗水池上速战速决那会儿
aside from the quickie we had up against the bathroom sink.

145
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,019
哪是什么速战速决
Not such a quickie.

146
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,740
他们把我锁在外面 我只得在货车里吃午饭
They locked me out and I had to eat my lunch in the truck.

147
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:52,076
那我租一辆货车又有什么意义?
Then what was the point of me renting a moving truck?

148
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,913
除了可以倚着车厢壁完成高难度动作的一炮
I mean, besides the rough sex we had up against the sides?

149
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:59,000
那次他们把我锁在车外 扔在路上了
They locked me outside on the side of the road for that one.

150
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,870
好了 我们该回去了
Okay, well, we have to go back in.

151
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:05,206
今晚的牛肉全餐见
See you tonight at the beef-a-thon.

152
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,425
不 Oleg
No, Oleg.

153
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,594
也许是我做得不公平
Maybe I'm being unfair.

154
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,597
这些东西都是你喜欢的
I mean, you have all this stuff that you like,

155
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,799
而她们又有个公寓
and they have an apartment.

156
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,768
把它们放进去吧
Put it in there.

157
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,603
喂Sophie!
Sophie!

158
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,555
8点见!
I'll see you at 8:00!

159
00:07:20,557 --> 00:07:22,557
你们说呢 妹子们?
So what do you say, girls?

160
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:23,891
绝对不行
Absolutely not...

161
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,276
可以
Yes.

162
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,062
Max 我答应自有我的道理
Max, there's a method to my madness.

163
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,315
Oleg 可以让我们说几句话吗?
Oleg, will you excuse us a second?

164
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,983
你可以帮帮Han拿箱子
And maybe help Han with that box.

165
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:34,986
站在那堆短裤里面 他都要得疝气了
In those shorts, I can actually see a hernia happening.

166
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,575
我还以为我们不牵涉其中的!
I thought we weren't getting involved!

167
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,076
如果我们帮Oleg的忙
If we help Oleg out,

168
00:07:42,078 --> 00:07:43,244
他会把那辆货车借给我们
he'll let us use the moving truck

169
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,295
去运我们的加热灯啊
to pick up our heat lamps.

170
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,830
我已经说了"我不要"
I already said "No" to those.

171
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,582
但是我们说好了啊!
But we just talked about it!

172
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,917
我没在听啊!
I wasn't listening!

173
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,971
那个小宝宝可是把脸摔进了土豆泥里了!
That baby fell face-down into mashed potatoes.

174
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,974
但是你答应了这个牛肉全餐
But you said "Yes" to the dinner party,

175
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,728
所以你要吃你的肉 那我要我的热
so if you get your meat, I get my heat.

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,565
别以为你说得押韵我就同意了
Just because you rhyme doesn't make it okay.

177
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,101
而且那句话肯定是蕾哈娜对克里斯・布朗说的
And I'm pretty sure that's what Rihanna said to Chris Brown.

178
00:08:17,462 --> 00:08:19,746
我们要去哪里跟这妹子见面买加热灯啊
Where are we meeting this chick with the heat lamps?

179
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,665
自从计划生育在新泽西实施起
I haven't gone this far for something I didn't want

180
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,918
我就没有为自己不想要的东西而跑过这么远
since Planned Parenthood moved to New Jersey.

181
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,086
喂!
Hello!

182
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,637
我在后面都要晕车了
I'm getting truck sick back here.

183
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,174
人人皆认为我的开车技术烂 你比我还烂
You're a worse driver than people assume I am.

184
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,260
快点! 快点!
Come on! Come on!

185
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,928
我们快要赶不上晚餐啦!
We're gonna be late to dinner!

186
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,230
有人愿意和我玩剪刀石头布吗
Would any of you be interested in playing

187
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,266
赢的人就可以坐前面
rock-paper-scissors for a seat up front?

188
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,600
不行!
No!

189
00:08:40,602 --> 00:08:44,070
妹子们 我可以问你们一个感情问题吗
Girls, can I ask you a relationship question?

190
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,438
不行!
No!

191
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,241
而且 我们哪会了解什么感情问题
And besides, what would we know about relationships?

192
00:08:48,243 --> 00:08:49,442
就像你去问唐纳德・特朗普
That's like asking Donald Trump

193
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:52,245
有什么好发型师一样
for the name of a good hairstylist.

194
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:53,914
她到底是怎么回事?
I mean, what's the deal with her?

195
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:55,448
她让我搬过去
She asks me to move in,

196
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,534
但是连一副画都不能带过去?
and then won't even let me have my painting?

197
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,786
Sophie连奶牛都买了一头
I mean, Sophie already bought the cow.

198
00:08:59,788 --> 00:09:02,589
她也许还会允许那奶牛拉屎
She might as well let the cow's crap in.

199
00:09:02,591 --> 00:09:05,041
所以你的意思是我有理
So you're saying I'm right.

200
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,876
不 不 但我确实觉得...
No, no, but I do think...

201
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:08,261
不 你才不觉得
No, you don't think,

202
00:09:08,263 --> 00:09:10,130
你纯粹就是没话找话说罢了
or your mouth wouldn't be moving right now.

203
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,432
我只是说
I'm just saying,

204
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,467
他有权把他的东西搬进
he has the right to move some of his stuff

205
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:17,304
Sophie公寓 并从我们公寓搬出去
into Sophie's apartment and out of ours.

206
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,139
说起他的东西
Speaking of his stuff,

207
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,807
这盒子里面有个东西
there's something in a box back here

208
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,310
正震动... 哦 停下了
is humming, and... oh, it stopped.

209
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,479
哦 又开始了
Oh, it started again.

210
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:29,950
这玩意可是有着仿真的人类嘴部
That's my lifelike mouth with authentic jaw action.

211
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:31,651
Oleg 看路!
Oleg, watch the road!

212
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,571
我真心不想听到"仿真嘴"
这种东西
The last words I hear can't be "lifelike mouth."

213
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,911
你这里相当不错啊 Sophie
Everything looks very nice, Sophie.

214
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,663
是嘛
Yeah, see,

215
00:09:43,665 --> 00:09:46,666
在其他客人来到之前我不打算说话
I'm not gonna talk until the other guests arrive.

216
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,921
我要把热情的待客之道留给真正的贵宾
I got to save my hostess sparkle for the real guests.

217
00:09:53,976 --> 00:09:54,975
嘿 宝贝
Hey, baby.

218
00:09:54,977 --> 00:09:57,727
你究竟死哪儿去了
Where the hell have you been?

219
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,597
这待客之道真是热情的要命
That was a pretty loud sparkle.

220
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:02,766
Sophie 大伙儿迟到全怪我
It's my fault we're late, Sophie...

221
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,484
没事 坐下吧
It's okay. Just sit down.

222
00:10:04,486 --> 00:10:06,186
你想不想知道我刚刚...
Don't you want to know what I was...

223
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,187
不想
No, really.

224
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,521
我这里的炖牛肉
I got a pot roast over here

225
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:10,523
比你有趣多了
that's a hell of a lot more interesting.

226
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,693
Max 感谢上帝你来了
Max, thank God you're here.

227
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,495
刚才的安静真是太尴尬了
There was so much awkward silence,

228
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:18,581
我还得假装接到一条香蕉的来电
I pretended I got a phone call from a banana.

229
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,168
我得去厕所冲一冲
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

230
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,088
Oleg 晚饭做好了
Oh, Oleg, Dinner is ready.

231
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,425
没时间让你去打飞机了啊
You don't have time to run down to the "Y" now.

232
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,429
不 我是说要在这里冲个澡
No, I meant I would shower here.

233
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,514
这里...
Here...

234
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,185
用我的浴室?
In my bathroom?

235
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:40,603
呃...
Uh...

236
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,855
是啊
Yeah.

237
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,940
我都搬来住了
I live here now.

238
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,226
哦 对啊
Oh, yeah.

239
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,445
还真是呢
That's right.

240
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,196
我要想象一下
Imagine that.

241
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:53,950
嘿 Oleg 你不如过来
Hey, Oleg, why don't you just come over here

242
00:10:53,952 --> 00:10:55,652
坐Earl旁边?
and sit next to Earl?

243
00:10:55,654 --> 00:10:58,988
因为他年纪大了 嗅觉没那么灵敏的
Because he's old and I'm sure his smeller is shot.

244
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:04,911
Sophie你一定要出本"待客之道"的书
Sophie, you really must write a "how to entertain" book.

245
00:11:06,581 --> 00:11:07,881
要上菜了
Here we go:

246
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:11,217
金克斯基姥姥的招牌炖肉
Grandma Chinkski's pot roast.

247
00:11:11,219 --> 00:11:12,552
看起来真可口
This looks amazing.

248
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,637
我特喜欢在冬天吃根菜
I love a root vegetable in the winter.

249
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,725
可以只以我为中心吗?
Can it ever just be about me?

250
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:24,431
# 小啊小牛肉 #
# Beef, beef, beef #

251
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,100
# 牛啊牛啊肉 #
# B-beef, b-beef, beef #

252
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,102
咋了 我在唱自己的牛肉歌啊
What? That's my beef song.

253
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,574
我想敬Sophie一杯
I'd like to make a toast to Sophie.

254
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,509
真是贴心
Oh, that's sweet.

255
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,611
但别用那酒杯
But not with that glass.

256
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:40,780
那是金斯基姥姥的玻璃杯
That's Grandma Chinski's crystal.

257
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:43,950
宝贝 我正在给你敬酒呢
Baby, I was in the middle of a toast.

258
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:45,919
真是不好意思 可...
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

259
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:48,254
这些杯子是我的最爱啊!
those are my favorite thing!

260
00:11:48,256 --> 00:11:52,375
是金斯基姥姥用两个傻表兄换来的
Grandma Chinski traded two of my slow cousins for those.

261
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,847
说来好笑
Well, you know, it's funny.

262
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,799
我也有个最爱
I have a favorite thing too.

263
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,352
要不 我去拿来给你看看?
In fact, why don't I just go and get it?

264
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,270
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

265
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,272
马上就要见着洛尼・安德森了!
I'm about to meet Loni Anderson!

266
00:12:04,272 --> 00:12:06,272
{\a6}洛尼・安德森 美国女星 

267
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,193
有人能帮我提下叉子吗?
Can someone help me lift up my fork?

268
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:13,229
搬趟东西我的双臂已经酸得不行了
My arms are still sore from the move.

269
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:14,481
张开嘴
Open up.

270
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,401
换你们来喂Han吧
Someone else has to feed Han.

271
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,204
他刚刚舔到了我的小指
He just licked my pinky.

272
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:24,574
Earl 在那干啥呢?
Earl, what are you doing over there?

273
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,712
在陪节奏布鲁斯歌手闲逛呢
Just hanging out with R&B sensation,

274
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:33,049
大名鼎鼎的大麻玛丽
Mary J.-juana.

275
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:34,634
好极了
Oh, good.

276
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:37,504
你这心态最适合去喂一个30岁的男人了
So you're in the right mind-set to hand-feed a 30-year-old man.

277
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,458
哦 别别别别
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

278
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,310
我估计波兰人就这么说"不"的
I think that's Polish for "No."

279
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:46,513
啊哈 就是这个 Sophie
Uh... huh. Yes, Sophie.

280
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:49,649
这是我的油画 说错了 我们的油画
It's my painting. Excuse me... our painting.

281
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,902
现在要挂在我们的墙上
And it's going up on our wall.

282
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:54,904
是我的问题呢
Is it me,

283
00:12:54,906 --> 00:12:57,690
还是这派对的气氛相当紧张啊?
or is this party tense as hell?

284
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,695
我觉得Sophie和Oleg合不来啊
I don't think Sophie and Oleg are gonna make it.

285
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:07,083
啊哦... 我大声说出来了吗?
Uh... oh. Am I talking out loud right now?

286
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:13,289
早跟你说了 我不要这东西挂在这里
I told you, I don't want that thing in here.

287
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:15,208
我不明白 不就是幅油画嘛
I don't understand. It's just a painting.

288
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,543
有什么大不了的?
What's so bad about it?

289
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,380
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

290
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,217
不错吧?
Nice, huh?

291
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,468
我亲手画的
I did it myself.

292
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,403
我的个人肖像
It's a paint-by-numbers.

293
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:30,056
你是想说普京肖像吧
You mean it's a Putin-by-numbers.

294
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:33,059
为什么上面乳头这么大?
Why are his nipples so big?

295
00:13:33,061 --> 00:13:35,111
我觉得不会太大啊
They don't seem that big to me.

296
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:41,868
哦 我已经嗨得受不了
Oh, I am too high for this.

297
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,870
我还不够嗨呢
I'm not high enough.

298
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:49,542
在我那 大乳头意味着财富和权力
In my culture, big nipples mean power and wealth.

299
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:51,544
在我这 大乳头意味着
In our culture, big nipples means,

300
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:54,380
"麻烦穿上衣服再去泳池"
"Wears a t-shirt in the pool."

301
00:13:54,382 --> 00:13:56,149
挂好了
There.

302
00:13:56,151 --> 00:13:57,417
我挺喜欢的
I like it.

303
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,089
给这房间带来种莫名的格调
Adds a certain something to the room.

304
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:06,075
每面墙都得挂上乳头
Every wall needs nipples.

305
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:08,144
那样男人们就知道看哪了
So a guy knows where to look.

306
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,732
谢谢你的主意 Caroline
Thank you for telling me to do this, Caroline.

307
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,653
她的主意?
She did?

308
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,025
我想站起来溜走 但我双腿发软
I'd get up and run, but my legs are like taffy.

309
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,777
说真的
Seriously,

310
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,247
你居然让他把那玩意儿挂起来?
you told him to hang that thing up?

311
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,250
说实在的 我当时还没见着那油画
In fairness, I had not seen the painting

312
00:14:30,252 --> 00:14:32,035
所以我才这么建议他的
when I suggested something like that.

313
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,120
我是说 我明白
I mean, I get it.

314
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:36,456
这确实很霸气
It's gorgeous.

315
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,592
但这跟屋内的装潢不搭
But it doesn't go with the decor.

316
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:41,261
什么?
What?

317
00:14:41,263 --> 00:14:45,798
所以你要丢掉这幅霸气的里外两用的挂像?
Is it throwing off this gorgeous outdoor-indoor swing?

318
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,185
再说小心我拿餐刀砍你!
I'll cut you with the carving knife!

319
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
谁也别砍谁
Nobody is cutting anyone.

320
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,892
特别是我
Especially not me.

321
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,227
你不懂吗?
Do you never learn?

322
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:00,480
赶紧像我这样用餐巾包住牛肉
Just put some beef in your napkin like I did,

323
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,982
然后赶紧离开这里
and let's get out of here.

324
00:15:02,984 --> 00:15:05,500
Sophie是你叫我搬来住的
Sophie, you asked me to move in.

325
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,987
现在可好? 我搬进来了
Guess what? I moved in.

326
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:10,456
是 是我叫你搬来的
Yes, I asked you to move in,

327
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,493
但没说带上这乳头大得出奇的普京像
but not with big weird-nipple Putin.

328
00:15:14,963 --> 00:15:17,046
那多大的乳头算正常?
Well, how big are nipples supposed to be?

329
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:18,798
因为... 算了
'Cause... never mind.

330
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:22,051
那你现在又发什么疯?
And what's your problem anyway?

331
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,587
我都给你挪了个抽屉
I gave you a drawer.

332
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:26,255
就这个!
This!

333
00:15:26,257 --> 00:15:28,341
大家快看 这就是我的抽屉
This is my drawer, everybody.

334
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,394
这么小有什么用?
What good is this?

335
00:15:31,396 --> 00:15:34,514
连个堵嘴球都装不下
I can't even get one of my ball gags in there.

336
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,852
你说要个抽屉 这不给了你个抽屉!
You asked for a drawer, I gave you a drawer!

337
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:43,156
再说谁用得上一打堵嘴球?
And who needs 12 ball gags anyway?

338
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,526
哦 现在你又不喜欢戴堵嘴球了?
Oh, so now you don't like ball gags?

339
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,578
你个女人算什么?
Who are you, lady?

340
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,832
我告诉你我就是...
I'll tell you who I am...

341
00:15:52,834 --> 00:15:57,704
我就是把这普京像丢进垃圾桶的女人!
I'm the lady who's "Putin" this is the trash!

342
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,676
你丢那个我就砸了这个
You trash that, I'll trash this.

343
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:04,877
哦 别
Oh, no.

344
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,262
哦 你是觉得你能摔
Oh, you think you're gonna break

345
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,014
金斯基姥姥的玻璃杯是吧?
one of Grandma Chinski's glasses?

346
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:11,134
没门 就算是摔 也是老娘摔!
No, if anyone's gonna break one, it's gonna be me!

347
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:16,222
这让我想起了我第二段婚姻的前半段
This reminds me of the first half of my second marriage,

348
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,358
和我第三段婚姻的后半段
and the second half of my third marriage.

349
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:22,612
Sophie我受够了
Sophie, I'm done.

350
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,697
正如你第一次约会时跟我说
And as you said to me on our first date,

351
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:27,233
"我不知道自己受得了多少"
"I don't know how much more of this I can take."

352
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:33,656
多么有趣的聚会啊
Fun party.

353
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:35,324
一点都不尴尬
Not awkward at all.

354
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:36,793
但是我真该走了
I should get going though.

355
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,911
我明天还得早起... 去啥来着?
Got to be up early for... what's a thing?

356
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:40,213
教会?
Church?

357
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,918
牛肉 牛肉 牛肉?
Beef, beef, beef?

358
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,921
牛 牛肉 牛肉 牛肉 牛肉?
B-beef, beef, beef, beef?

359
00:17:00,456 --> 00:17:03,040
昨天的聚会真是不好意思啊
Sorry about that dinner party last night.

360
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:06,793
我有点失控了
It kind of got away from me a little bit.

361
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:10,047
你们能早起帮我把Oleg的东西运回去
But I really appreciate you getting up early

362
00:17:10,049 --> 00:17:12,799
我实在是太感激了
and helping me move Oleg's stuff back.

363
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:15,052
我只是觉得我也有错...
I just actually feel like this is a little bit my fault...

364
00:17:15,054 --> 00:17:16,720
说真的!
Seriously!

365
00:17:16,722 --> 00:17:20,057
可以让我做焦点吗?
Can it ever just be about me?

366
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:22,059
嘿 唔
Hey, um,

367
00:17:22,061 --> 00:17:24,277
我们要把他的东西运到哪儿去?
where are we taking his stuff anyway?

368
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:26,480
我觉得即使是好意 也无法接受
I don't think goodwill will take a love seat

369
00:17:26,482 --> 00:17:30,317
那张沾满爱液的性爱椅子
that's actually covered in love.

370
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,319
呃 我在想
Well, I was thinking,

371
00:17:32,321 --> 00:17:34,621
你们也知道 我和Oleg的关系
you know, since Oleg and I

372
00:17:34,623 --> 00:17:37,240
确实不一般
really did have something special,

373
00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:39,242
所以我想着我干脆
I was thinking I would just take his stuff

374
00:17:39,244 --> 00:17:41,661
把他的东西丢到河里得了
and dump it down by the river.

375
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:43,462
好吧 我一定要说出来...
Okay, I'm just gonna say it...

376
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,032
Sophie 让Oleg把那幅破画
Sophie, would it kill you

377
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:48,051
挂在墙上 会要了你的命吗?
to just let Oleg hang the damn painting?

378
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:56,810
天啊 你就这样
So what, you just park the truck

379
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,895
把货车停在高速公路上?
in the middle of the Van Wyck Expressway?

380
00:17:58,897 --> 00:18:00,847
你就不能受点教训吗?
Do you never learn?

381
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:03,850
我差点连租车公司的地毯都吃下去了
I almost ate Rent-A-Truck floor mat.

382
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:07,687
Caroline 你把话说清楚...
Caroline, you get this straight...

383
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:09,689
是Oleg的错
Oleg was wrong.

384
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:13,193
普京乳头实在是太大了
And those nipples were way too big.

385
00:18:14,196 --> 00:18:17,030
太尴尬了
This is awkward.

386
00:18:17,032 --> 00:18:19,750
你在卡车里?
You're in the truck?

387
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:22,702
不 是你在我的房间里
No, you're in my apartment.

388
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,176
我觉得我们被撞了
I think something hit us.

389
00:18:32,815 --> 00:18:34,815
你们只是需要接受配偶治疗
You guys just need some couples therapy.

390
00:18:34,817 --> 00:18:35,803
我来帮你们调解吧
I'll mediate it,

391
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:37,151
我曾经给自己做过治疗
since I've had therapy myself.

392
00:18:37,406 --> 00:18:40,788
虽然我没有另一半 但希望在未来有
Not as a couple, but hopefully someday.

393
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,957
我只想坐在这等拖车
I'm just sitting here waiting for the tow truck to come.

394
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:46,126
你的脖子还好吗 Max?
How's your neck, Max?

395
00:18:46,128 --> 00:18:47,444
还好
Not so bad.

396
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:49,913
被第一辆车撞歪的脖子
The second car that hit us kind of knocked

397
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:53,667
又被第二辆车给撞回原位了
what the first car knocked out of place back in place.

398
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:54,752
我先来
I'll start.

399
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:57,137
这个女人就是一个骗子
This woman is a fraud and a liar.

400
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:58,554
好吧 呃
Okay, well,

401
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,842
要欧普拉式的真情 少点杰里・斯普林格式的讽刺
we need a little more Oprah, a little less Jerry Springer.

402
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,627
嘿 别说杰里・斯普林格的坏话
Hey, don't dis Springer.

403
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:05,963
他们的绿屋子里的零食很好吃
They have great snacks in the green room.

404
00:19:05,965 --> 00:19:07,917
你上过杰里・斯普林格的节目?
You were on Jerry Springer?

405
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:09,545
没错 我参加了"我讨厌我室友"
Yeah, I was on "I hate my roommate

406
00:19:09,545 --> 00:19:11,947
但不知道怎么告诉她"那期节目
and I don't know how to tell her."

407
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:15,425
Oleg和我说不清楚的
Oleg and I are not gonna talk this thing out.

408
00:19:15,425 --> 00:19:16,748
如果你想浪费时间
If you want to waste your time,

409
00:19:16,748 --> 00:19:19,026
就去市中心的中学教书吧
go teach in an inner city high school.

410
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:22,113
你知道吗? 为了更有效地治疗
You know what? Even better...

411
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:23,814
我来帮Oleg说话
I'll do the talking for Oleg.

412
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:25,983
哦 那么 Max... 你来帮我 好吗Max?
Oh, then, Max... you be me, okay, Max?

413
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:27,234
呃... 我不知道是不是...
Oh... I don't know if...

414
00:19:27,236 --> 00:19:29,236
你还想不想要剩下的牛肉了?
Do you want the rest of the beef, or not?

415
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:32,323
这个家伙是个混蛋 那些画应该被丢掉
This guy is a bum, and the painting has to go.

416
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,874
简直太蠢了
It's stupid.

417
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,376
非常 非常好 Max
Really, really good, Max

418
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,411
但是下一次 你的腰得挺直 嗯 没错
but next time just arch your back a little, and, yeah.

419
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:39,246
好的
Yeah.

420
00:19:39,248 --> 00:19:41,248
好吧 你来当我
Okay, you be me.

421
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,920
不 我不要受你勃起的老二威胁
No, I don't feel like getting a threatening erection right now.

422
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:48,800
但是 当人们住在一起时
But I will say, anytime people move in together,

423
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,018
就得相互妥协
it's a compromise.

424
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:50,982
看看Max...
Look at Max...

425
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:54,478
当我需要安身之所 她还让我保留了自己的马
when I needed a place to stay, she let me have my horse.

426
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,815
这么说吧 我在斯普林格的节目也这么说的
Let me just say... and I brought this up on Springer...

427
00:19:57,817 --> 00:20:01,852
我是为了那匹马才让你住的
I only let you in because of the horse.

428
00:20:01,854 --> 00:20:04,188
还有就是我终于不再反对
And I finally stopped putting up a fight

429
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,990
同意让Max在街上裸奔
and let Max walk around naked.

430
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:07,158
这是什么时候的事?
When did that happen?

431
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,360
明天
Tomorrow.

432
00:20:09,362 --> 00:20:10,407
哦 Oleg
Oh, Oleg,

433
00:20:10,407 --> 00:20:13,864
我不想阻止你在街上裸奔
I wouldn't want you to give up walking around naked.

434
00:20:13,866 --> 00:20:17,168
只要你别坐在白色的东西上面就行
I mean, as long as you don't sit down on anything white.

435
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,836
有道理
Makes sense.

436
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:22,256
没人喜欢在椅子上留下个巧克力色的印迹
Nobody likes a chocolate starfish on an ottoman.

437
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:27,628
Sophie得分
Point, Sophie.

438
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,015
哈! 我赢了 看见没! 
Ha! I'm winning, everybody!

439
00:20:31,017 --> 00:20:32,550
呃 这是治疗性谈话
Well, it's therapy.

440
00:20:32,552 --> 00:20:34,401
没有输赢
There are no winners and losers.

441
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:37,938
听起来像是输家说的话
Sounds like something a loser would say.

442
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,558
你知道吗 Oleg
You know, Oleg,

443
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,111
这不是这些破画的问题
this isn't about that silly little painting.

444
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:46,947
只是 呃
It's just, uh,

445
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:51,068
在这么短的时间里发生了这么多变化...
a lot of change in a short amount of time...

446
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:56,874
让我感到害怕
I'm so scared.

447
00:20:58,744 --> 00:21:00,161
Sophie宝贝啊
Sophie,

448
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:03,547
只要有你 其他东西我都不在乎
I don't care about my stuff, as long as I have you.

449
00:21:06,302 --> 00:21:09,303
我们做了什么?
What did we just do?
