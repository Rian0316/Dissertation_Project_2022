1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,660
Previously on Desperate Housewifes...

1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,760
My name is Bree, and I am an alcoholic.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,400
Bree put her problem behind her.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,860
- There's at least one employer who'd love to hire me.  - Who?

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,500
- Orson asked for a job.  - You.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,430
- Dave lost his temper...  - Damn it, Edie! I said no!

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,260
- And aroused the suspicion...  - This guy is up to something.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,500
- of his neighbor.  - It was all Karen Mccluskey's fault.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,700
She kept asking me all this stuff about your background.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,100
She reminds me of my grandmother when we first started to notice.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,600
- The dementia, that is.  - You think Karen's going senile?

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,830
It could have been such a lovely evening.

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,600
You see, the idea was to have a surprise birthday party.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,600
People would bring food and gifts

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,600
and wait in the dark

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,760
for the guest of honor to arrive.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,760
But it turned out to be a night full of surprises...

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,860
The kind most people don't care for.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,800
Damn it, Lynette. Why do you have to be such a buzz kill?

19
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,760
Why can't you, just once, give me a little support?

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,330
Fine. I'll get you a towel.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,800
For what?

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,430
If I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,100
No, it wouldn't.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,600
Mm.

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's worth,

26
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,100
the guilt has been tearing me apart.

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,430
Get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,100
Orson, please. You're putting me in an impossible position.

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,660
Then let me make it simpler for you.

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,530
I want a divorce.

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,300
Oh, yes, it could have been such a lovely evening,

32
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,330
but this was one party that was over...

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,700
before it even began.

34
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,800
Surprise!

35
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,300
You think you can screw with me?

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,760
Uhh!

37
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,930
Moments before she was to leave for the party,

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
Gabrielle Solis was at her mirror,

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,100
halfheartedly putting the final touches on her lips.

40
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,660
You see, a problem had come to her attention...

41
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Damn.

42
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,860
One she couldn't gloss over.

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,730
Mommy, what are you doing?

44
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,730
Uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month,

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,700
and she's late, and that's bad.

46
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,700
- Why?  - Because she's the one who assures me

47
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,030
- that you won't get a baby brother or sister.  - But I want a little brother.

48
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,730
I don't care.

49
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,600
Oh, sorry.

50
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,660
It's just... Mommy really misses her friend,

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,760
and mommy's gonna be really sad

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,760
if her friend doesn't show up soon.

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,600
Now go downstairs and play. Mommy has some praying to do.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,030
Well, I have your test results.

55
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,360
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,860
Aah!

57
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,260
Mrs. Solis.

58
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,460
I don't care. You told me this couldn't happen.

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,730
- You said it was impossible!  - The human reproductive system is complicated

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,230
and often unpredictable.

61
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Sometimes miracles happen.

62
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,630
This isn't a miracle. This is a disaster.

63
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,900
My husband's blind. Neither one of us have jobs.

64
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,800
My husband's blind.

65
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,330
Trust me. Children are a blessing.

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,430
You'll see. It'll all work out.

67
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,560
Well, I hope to god you're right.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,730
And what does this number mean anyway?

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,230
That's your beta number,

70
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,930
and it's high, which indicates the possibility of twins.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,730
Ow!

72
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,330
Gaby, relax. This baby is gonna be the best thing

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,700
- that ever happened to us.  - I am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full.

74
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,560
The glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account.

75
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,560
Is that what you're worried about... money?

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,460
Look, I'll get a job.

77
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,460
What are you gonna do,

78
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,330
take up piano and get a contract with motown?

79
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,330
Actually, I was thinking about becoming a masseur.

80
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,160
You don't need your eyes for that. It's all about the touch.

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,630
Well, I guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had.

82
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,630
But it's not just about the money, Carlos.

83
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,130
It's...

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,800
Oh, after my miscarriage, I gave up on this dream.

85
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,800
I just figured God decided

86
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,800
I couldn't possibly be a good mom,

87
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,860
so he didn't make it happen.

88
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,860
Well, he obviously changed his mind.

89
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,130
Well, I wish he'd stop doing that.

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,230
Nobody likes a fickle God.

91
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,860
Babe, believe me.

92
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,060
You getting pregnant is... is... is a one-in-a-million shot.

93
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,560
It's a miracle.

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,960
Now let's embrace it and celebrate.

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,730
Hello, Mrs. Solis.

96
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,030
I have your test results.

97
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
Great. So do I have anemia?

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,060
Is that why I've been so tired?

99
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,700
No. Not exactly.

100
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,530
And please don't slap me.

101
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,230
- I'm pregnant!  - Oh, my god. It's another miracle.

102
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,230
Yeah, we're up to two miracles,

103
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,560
And if you come back from the dead after I kill you,

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,460
- It'll be three.  - Why... why you mad at me?

105
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,460
"Oh, Gaby, why do I need to wear a condom?

106
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,230
There's no way lightning's gonna strike twice."

107
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,230
Well, I didn't think it would.

108
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,700
Put the baby down, Carlos.

109
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,560
I don't want to.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Do it. I need to hit something, and it needs to be you.

111
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,400
You are looking at this all wrong.

112
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,900
This is one-in-a-million.

113
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,200
We should... we should celebrate and embrace...

114
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,260
Oh, cram it, you fertile freak.

115
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,060
You're getting a vasectomy.

116
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,600
I can't do that.

117
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:53,930
We're catholic. It's against our religion.

118
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,600
I got news for you. We just converted to judaism.

119
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,930
Problem solved. Mazel tov!

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,030
Gaby, it's not just that. There are other reasons...

121
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,460
I am done fighting off your bionic sperm.

122
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,200
You're getting snipped, and that's final.

123
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,100
You're awfully quiet tonight.

124
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,260
Got a lot on my mind.

125
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,030
I think I'm pregnant.

126
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,530
What?

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,800
I know. It's crazy. You had a vasectomy. It's impossible.

128
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,830
Yeah. So what makes you think you're preant?

129
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,330
My period's late, and that never happens to me.

130
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,230
- I'm like a swiss clock.  - Oh, come on. There could be a lot of reasons for that.

131
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,760
So let's not worry about it right now.

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,260
We're going to a party. You gotta lighten up.

133
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,430
- Okay. But I'm gonna talk to Bob.  - Bob? Why?

134
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,960
Because he and Lee are here. Bob's an attorney.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm gonna get him to sue the Qck

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,960
Who obviously botched your vasectomy.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,960
Oh, Gaby, let's not go there. Hiring an attorney's expensive,

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,460
and I don't know that we can prove anything.

139
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,460
Well, I'm gonna find out.

140
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,030
Fine. But...

141
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,000
Let's not talk to Bob.

142
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't want our neighbors involved in our business.

143
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, don't worry. He's a professional.

144
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,500
He'll keep it confidential.

145
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,530
Gaby, no. You can't talk to him.

146
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,700
- Why the hell not?  - I never got a vasectomy.

147
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,000
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.

148
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,230
Earlier that evening,

149
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,730
As she waited for her guests to arrive,

150
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,060
Susan Mayer took a moment to do her eyebrows.

151
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,330
Of course, she had no way of knowing

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,460
Just how high those eyebrows...

153
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,930
- Sorry I'm late.  - Would soon be raised.

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,930
What took you so long? People are gonna be here any minute.

155
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
I need you to pour the cheap vodka

156
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,460
- into the expensive bottles.  - I couldn't find my pants.

157
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,200
I'm here so much that when I go back to my place,

158
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,800
- I can't remember where anything is.  - Well, just please change your shirt.

159
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,160
You know, I've been thinking

160
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,000
- that I spend so much time with you now anyway that...  - Fine. You can have a little space in the closet.

161
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,000
I think I've got some clothes from the '80s

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,660
- I'm ready to part with.  - Actually, I'm talking about moving in.

163
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,130
Moving in? Here?

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,860
Yeah. That's where we're headed.

165
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,400
We should take the plunge. What do you think?

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,430
So obviously, this is the bedroom.

167
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,430
Right. So do you want to stick with this color

168
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,430
or switch it up or what?

169
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,060
I don't know. Um...

170
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,100
I'm sort of going through

171
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,200
A difficult transition in my life right now.

172
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,500
I need a change.

173
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,900
Uh, I was thinking....

174
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,230
Taupe.

175
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,930
Sounds good.

176
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,060
You know, I like this place.

177
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,130
It's got a good vibe.

178
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,260
Uh, thanks.

179
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,800
And a nice scent. What is that, your perfume?

180
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,060
Get out

181
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,360
Excuse me?

182
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,830
I was not born yesterday, pal. You're coming on to me.

183
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,330
No, I'm not.

184
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Oh, please. Telling me I smell good?

185
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,360
- I'm not even wearing deodorant.  - I said the house smells good.

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Semantics.

187
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,260
And then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver?

188
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,430
You know, why not just ask for a massage?

189
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,430
I sat because my feet hurt from you dragging me around

190
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,160
- for an hour, telling me you want to paint every room taupe.  - You said you liked it.

191
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,160
Look, you're obviously going through a rough patch.

192
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,660
I was afraid

193
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,030
If I suggested anything outside the beige family,

194
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,600
I might send you over the edge.

195
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,600
I'll let myself out.

196
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,300
No. No, don't go.

197
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,060
That was very sweet of you to consider my feelings.

198
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,930
You know what?

199
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,730
You're hired.

200
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
Uh, thanks...

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,260
I think.

202
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,460
So do you need to look these over one more time?

203
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,200
Okay, then just sign them,

204
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,060
and you'll be officially divorced.

205
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,660
You know what? We need a minute.

206
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,630
Take your time.

207
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,730
Are we doing the right thing here?

208
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,860
You're kidding me, right?

209
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,460
Once we sign these papers, there's no going back.

210
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,330
I can't believe this.

211
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,900
You were the one who called the lawyer.

212
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,430
I know.

213
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm thinking...

214
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,230
That maybe that was a mistake.

215
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,130
We've been separated for a year.

216
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,130
All we're doing today is making it official.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,130
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident.

218
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,660
You know that. Before that, we were good.

219
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,460
We could get back there.

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,530
Susan...

221
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,900
It's nobody's fault, but I can't do this anymore.

222
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,830
Oh, come on!

223
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,960
We were Mike and Susan, remember?

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,530
You only get one of those in a lifetime.

225
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,300
We could make things right again.

226
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,030
Yeah.

227
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,560
And here's how.

228
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,300
Hey. You're back.

229
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,600
So what do you think?

230
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,800
Uh... It... it looks good.

231
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,800
Yeah, I... I... I think you were right to stick with this color.

232
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,300
It looks fantastic.

233
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,530
Thanks.

234
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,560
Do you like Scotch?

235
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,400
Okay...

236
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,560
I need to be honest about something.

237
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,900
H-honest? Okay.

238
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,400
I don't usually do this kind of thing,

239
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,900
Hook up like this, out of the blue.

240
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,730
Not that it wasn't great,'cause it was,

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,960
But I'm not really looking to start anything.

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,060
Work is crazy,

243
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,760
And I just got a dog, and...

244
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,460
I'm just not in that place right now.

245
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,160
So just to be clear,

246
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,460
You're saying you don't want a relationship?

247
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,600
Sorry. I probably should have said that right up front.

248
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,300
No, uh...

249
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,800
It's fantastic.

250
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,730
Really?

251
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,530
I don't want a relationship either.

252
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,900
All I want from you is exactly what we just did.

253
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,300
Except next time, it's Susan.

254
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,730
Yeah.

255
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,660
"mrs. Mayer" was probably a little formal for the moment.

256
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,630
So there's gonna be a next time?

257
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,430
Unless you're not interested.

258
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,930
Are you kidding?

259
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,230
I'm this close to doing a victory lap around the bed.

260
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,300
So you're really fine with this,

261
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,160
Just a purely physical thing?

262
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,160
I gave romance a shot and...

263
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,160
I'm ready for something a little more casual.

264
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,330
Wow.

265
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,430
I've heard of women like you, but...

266
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,630
I thought you were an urban myth.

267
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,300
Hmm.

268
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,100
Did you hear what I said?

269
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,960
Uh, yeah.

270
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,100
You want to move in.

271
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,230
I-it's just that when I'm not with you,

272
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm waiting to be with you.

273
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,000
I've never felt like this before.

274
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,130
So... What do you think?

275
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,200
Do you want to live together?

276
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,000
Uh...

277
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,460
No.

278
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,030
So that's it? Just no?

279
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,900
You're not gonna give me a reason?

280
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,900
What's wrong with the way things are?

281
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,560
Why change everything now?

282
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,260
Because... I've fallen in love with you.

283
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,030
Hi, guys. Welcome to the party.

284
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,060
The last thing lynette Scavo did before a party

285
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,700
Was to check for gray hairs.

286
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,000
Penny!

287
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,060
Let's go! Time for bath!

288
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,060
She had no way of knowing before this evening was over,

289
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,060
She would have a few more.

290
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,830
Penny!

291
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,560
Oh. Penny.

292
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,100
If you're thinking of taking that for a spin,

293
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,600
I've got bad news.

294
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,160
You're 9.

295
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,530
Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?

296
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,660
Is daddy dying?

297
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,960
What? Of course not.

298
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,060
Why would you say something like that?

299
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,500
I heard Porter and Preston

300
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Fighting about who's gonna get daddy's car when he dies.

301
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,730
Oh. They're just being silly.

302
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
They're always silly.

303
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:16,800
That's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house.

304
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,560
Come on.

305
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,430
But everybody dies someday, right?

306
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,630
Yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age

307
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,630
Unless he doesn't get home

308
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,630
In time for Mrs. Mccluskey's party,

309
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,630
And then all bets are off.

310
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,130
Oh, daddy's gonna be fine. Come on.

311
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,260
Hi. My husband... I'm Lynette Scavo.

312
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,800
- Dr. Baron called me...  - I'm Dr. Baron.

313
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,360
Oh. Hi. What happened?

314
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,000
Your husband was working on an electrical panel

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,960
- At his restaurant...  - Uh-huh.

316
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,560
And received a massive shock.

317
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,330
- Essentially, his heart stopped pumping.  - Oh. Is he...

318
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,600
Fortunately,

319
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,600
There was a policeman eating in the restaurant.

320
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,230
He administered C.P.R. until the ambulance got there.

321
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,760
So he's okay?

322
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,500
His heart restarted.

323
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,000
Now it's a matter of determining if there's any tissue damage.

324
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,060
We're optimistic, but the next 36 hours are critical.

325
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,800
Father O'brien, please report to the...

326
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,830
Hey

327
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
Hey.

328
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,330
So I'm thinking

329
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,600
No more electrical work, okay?

330
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,430
Huh?

331
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,260
The kids know everything's fine.

332
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,800
They send their love.

333
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,130
Don't worry about anything, okay? Just rest.

334
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,030
I'll come back soon, okay?

335
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,700
You know what I thought?

336
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,630
When I was lying there on the floor,

337
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,030
I thought, I'm gonna die in a pizza place.

338
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,030
I mean, my whole life was gonna be summed up

339
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,860
With this obituary headline...

340
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,330
"local pizza shop owner dies."

341
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,860
But it doesn't matter because you're not dying.

342
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,330
I need more, lynette. I need... th... there's gotta be more.

343
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,030
Okay. Okay. We'll find more.

344
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,030
Just rest now, okay?

345
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,700
Hey, sexy.

346
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,730
Drop the rake and get in.

347
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,230
What the hell is this?

348
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,800
This is the car that I have wanted my whole life.

349
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,800
When I was 12 years old,

350
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,760
I had a poster of this baby up on my wall.

351
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,300
And when I was 12, I had a poster of Shaun Cassidy,

352
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,500
But you don't see me driving around in him, do you? I want to show you something.

353
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,630
What, do machine guns come out of the headlights?

354
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,300
I carry this around to remind me

355
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,730
Of the day that I almost died.

356
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,730
That day you promised me that we would find more.

357
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm keeping the car.

358
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,860
So do you want a ride?

359
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,360
Ooh!

360
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,960
Where have you been?

361
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,460
So help me, if Mccluskey gets there before us,

362
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,130
- I will brain you.  - Sorry. Let's go.

363
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,260
- Well, Sheesh.  - Oh.

364
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,960
Sweetie, we already got Karen a candle.

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,530
An R.V. might be overkill.

366
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,430
Yeah, but that's not for her. That's for us.

367
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,760
Huh?

368
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,760
I'm about to blow your mind, Iynette.

369
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,630
Oh, don't. I like my mind the way it is.

370
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,600
What would you say to the idea

371
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,900
Of taking the kids out of school for a year

372
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:21,400
And bopping around the country in one of these sweet rides?

373
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,060
Well, I might not say anything.

374
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,060
I might just put my finger to my ear

375
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,700
And twirl it in small circles.

376
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,830
- We can't do something like that, Tom.   - Yes, we can. We can do whatever we want. Life is short.

377
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,900
Okay, let me ask you one tiny question

378
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,900
About this big adventure plan of yours

379
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,900
Who's gonna be running our restaurant

380
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,030
While we're off doing "the electric Kool-Aid acid test"?

381
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,430
That won't be our problem. The last few weeks,

382
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,500
I've been talking to a guy from Passentino's pizza.

383
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,530
They want to buy us out.

384
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,960
This afternoon, I said yes.

385
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,130
Hey, guys.

386
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,700
You ready to party?

387
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,600
Moments before she was due at her friend's party,

388
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,460
Bree Hodge was at the mirror, applying her eyeliner.

389
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,300
Aren't you dapper?

390
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,400
When I tell everyone I'm your new partner,

391
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,460
- I want to look the part.  - It would not be the last time that evening

392
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,600
- Bree would find herself...  - Um, actually, dear...

393
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,160
Drawing a line.

394
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,530
I'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.

395
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,500
But, Bree, this is the first party in months

396
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,600
When I can answer the question, "what's new?"

397
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,730
- Without mumbling into my drink.  -Well,it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party.

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,430
Mm. You haven't told Katherine yet, have you?

399
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,230
It's not that easy.

400
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,200
You know she'll be furious.

401
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,160
Yes, but the great thing about Katherine is she'll express it

402
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,130
so passive aggressively, we'll hardly notice.

403
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,530
Look, I know she's your friend, but she's also our employee.

404
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Why is this so difficult for you?

405
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,430
It's... complicated.

406
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,830
Well... another dead soldier.

407
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,500
Careful, dear. You don't want to be ill tomorrow.

408
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,500
Yes. Nothing like a headache

409
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,200
to spoil a perfectly nice first day in prison.

410
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,000
Uh, would anybody like some more frittata?

411
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,630
Is my wife amazing or what? I mean, how many inmates

412
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,030
get sent off with a festive champagne brunch?

413
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,030
Uh, when you're in jail,

414
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,460
you might want to avoid words like "festive" and "brunch."

415
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,030
They kind of say, "Hi. I'm husband hunting."

416
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,160
Andrew, please.

417
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
It's fine.

418
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,560
This is my last taste of freedom for three years.

419
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,900
I want jokes. I want fun, laughter.

420
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,900
Anyway, prison won't be such a big change.

421
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,360
You're a dentist. You're used to cavity searches.

422
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,760
You vowed to me that you wouldn't say that.

423
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,830
Bree tells me

424
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,100
- that you're going to make very good use of your time away.  - Mm.

425
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,860
Uh, yes. He's going to read a lot of classic books,

426
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,200
- maybe study a language.  - Oh.

427
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,160
Yes, uh, he can learn the Italian for,

428
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,300
"I cost five cigarettes."

429
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,760
Andrew, really.

430
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,600
Bree, he's joking. Everything's fine...

431
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,160
Except my glass,

432
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,460
which seems to be empty.

433
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,330
Bree?

434
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,100
Bree?

435
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,430
Oh, for god sake. Get up.

436
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,660
We have the garden club lunch in...

437
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,100
You've been drinking?

438
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,900
Go away. I don't feel well.

439
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,460
We have a lunch to cater.

440
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,660
I'm too tired. Can you do it?

441
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,730
Get up.

442
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,430
Oh.

443
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,430
When did this start?

444
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,100
When Orson left, I...

445
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,030
Began having a glass of white wine now and then.

446
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,060
Then when Danielle took Benjamin,

447
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,360
I didn't see any reason to stop at just one.

448
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,730
So is this why you missed the lunch last week

449
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,800
and the Braverman Bar Mitzvah?

450
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,460
I can't help myself, all right?

451
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,460
My husband's gone. My son's gone.

452
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
I have nothing left.

453
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,900
No, actually, you have a lunch for 40 in 3 hours,

454
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,930
- and I'm not letting you out of it.  - Oh, Katherine, please.

455
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,930
Okay, so you have a void in your life.

456
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,800
Welcome to the club. Don't fill it with wine.

457
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,930
Fill it with work, with accomplishments.

458
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,930
Just think about the woman you could be

459
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,730
by the time Orson gets back.

460
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,860
Or is this the woman you want him to come home to?

461
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,260
He's gonna be so ashamed of me.

462
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,330
No, he won't...

463
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,200
Because you're not gonna tell him.

464
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,460
You know he'd just blame himself.

465
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,030
I don't know if I can make it this time.

466
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,600
Yes, you will,

467
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,900
Because I am moving in.

468
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,060
You would do that?

469
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,030
When I had nothing,

470
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
you made me your partner.

471
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,060
I'm not gonna forget that.

472
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,530
I am gonna get you through this.

473
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,800
And when we're done, that scary woman over there...

474
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,600
She's never gonna be seen in this house again.

475
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,260
When you think about it,

476
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,260
tonight is the ideal time for you to tell Katherine.

477
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
The presence of the other guests

478
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,300
will keep her from causing a scene,

479
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,300
- and as word spreads that we're partners...  - And how is word going to spread?

480
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,300
I'll be spreading it. People will be congratulating me,

481
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,300
- and Katherine will have to join in and risk looking petty.  - And she'll be twice as mad

482
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,300
at having been put in that position.

483
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,800
- I am not telling her tonight.  - Fine. Then I will.

484
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,830
- No, you will not. I forbid it.  - You know, for a partner, you're sounding a lot like a boss.

485
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,830
- I am telling her.  - Look, if we can't agree on something this basic,

486
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,830
- maybe we shouldn't work together.  - What are you saying?

487
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,830
I'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company.

488
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,830
- I have no intention of reconsidering.  - Fine. You're fired.

489
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,830
Hey, guys. You ready to party?

490
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,730
The party was in full swing,

491
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,860
and everyone was waiting to surprise the guest of honor.

492
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,760
Little did they know,

493
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
an even bigger surprise was on its way.

494
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,900
Sorry I'm late. There was a line at the bakery.

495
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,860
Well, you really went all out.

496
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,560
Yeah, she deserves it.

497
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
Can I help you, Mrs. Mccluskey?

498
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:24,960
This letter for Edie came to my house by mistake.

499
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,500
I'm making sure that none of my stuff, uh, came here.

500
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,030
Well, it's all yours.

501
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Hey.

502
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
Anything interesting?

503
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:42,000
Fortunately, no.

504
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,930
I just saw your friend Karen outside.

505
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,130
Is she still asking you questions about me?

506
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,060
A few, but don't take it personally.

507
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,930
Prying is what people too old to have sex do

508
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,460
to keep life interesting.

509
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,130
She's turning 70 next week.

510
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,460
No kidding.

511
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,760
Hey, we should throw her a party.

512
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,600
I'm already taking her out for a drink. That's plenty.

513
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,060
She'll be 70, sweetheart.

514
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't you think that calls for something bigger?

515
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,430
Look, Karen's a friend,

516
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,560
But I don't like having her in my house.

517
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,860
It would be one thing

518
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,560
- if we had a bathroom with a window you could open,but...  - Well,couldn't you ask someone else to host it?

519
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,230
Well, I suppose I could palm it off to Mayer.

520
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,860
Good. Tell her we'll supply the food and liquor.

521
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,830
You know, Karen's not a fan of yours.

522
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,560
Why do you want to throw her a party?

523
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,500
It's a big day for her.

524
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,900
I just want to make sure it's special.

525
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:36,200
So...

526
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,830
What do you think?

527
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,760
I think that is one hell of an outfit

528
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,230
to wear to a 70th birthday party.

529
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,960
It's my gift to Karen.

530
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,830
I figure she'll get at least five good boob jokes out of it.

531
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,760
Well, she'll be here soon,

532
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,860
So let's go over this one more time.

533
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,830
Okay. I take her home,

534
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,730
Then I come up with some excuse to get her over to Susan's,

535
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,030
where everyone jumps out and yells, "Surprise!"

536
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,930
Which I still say isn't the smartest thing to do

537
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,860
to a 70-year-old.

538
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,200
Mrs. Mccluskey.

539
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,360
Happy birthday.

540
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,260
Jeez, Edie, are we going for drinks or mammograms?

541
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,500
That's one.

542
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,400
Oh, let me grab my earrings, and we're good to go.

543
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,700
So...

544
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,860
70.

545
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,360
It's quite a milestone.

546
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,860
How's it feel?

547
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,130
No big whoop.

548
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,230
Edie told me that she takes you

549
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,200
Out for a birthday drink every year.

550
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,360
I think that's a great tradition.

551
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,960
Look, I'm just trying to be friends here.

552
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,560
All righty then.

553
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,800
- I'll see you later.  - Mm...hmm.

554
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,730
Come on. Let's go.

555
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,200
I get enough friends.

556
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,860
Oh.

557
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,430
Where's Karen?

558
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,400
- She'll be here as soon as she gives her cat some medicine.  - Mm.

559
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,400
- Mm.  - Do I you think she'll be surprised?

560
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,760
Oh, absolutely.

561
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,700
What the...

562
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,430
Dave.

563
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,700
Just so I'm clear,

564
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,960
You want us to sell our thriving business

565
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,360
So we can live in a bus, like Carnies?

566
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,060
Come on. This is cool. We can go wherever we want.

567
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,330
The...the kids could see America.

568
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,460
And when we start stealing to support ourselves,

569
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,400
the kids can see the inside of a prison.

570
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,530
You're right, Tom. It's a brilliant idea.

571
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,600
Damn it, Lynette. Why do you have to be such a buzz kill?

572
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:57,500
Why can't you, just once, give me a little support?

573
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,700
Fine. I'll get you a towel.

574
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,130
For what?

575
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,130
Bree you can't fire me. Not after all the sacrifices I made for you.

576
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,130
Orson, stop throwing jail in my face.

577
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,060
You cellmate was a crooked C.P.A.

578
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,800
Who helped you form a bridge club. It wasn't exactly Attica.

579
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,530
Bree, I need this job.

580
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Do you have any idea what it's like to wake up every morning

581
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,000
And have no reason to get out of bed?

582
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,960
To smile and nod at neighbors

583
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,800
Who knows your wife's supporting you

584
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:30,530
Because no one will hire a felon?

585
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,260
I am drowning, and for you to throw me a lifeline

586
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,160
- And then snatch it away...  - Orson, I should have never offered you that job.

587
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,600
- It wasn't fair to Katherine.  - I am your husband.

588
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:42,160
- Why are you putting Katherine's feelings ahead of mine?  - Orson, please.

589
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,000
- You're putting me in an impossible position.  - Then let me make it simpler for you.

590
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,560
I want a divorce.

591
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,130
Hi.

592
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,000
Katherine, great dress.

593
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,560
You're gonna turn some heads with that one.

594
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,560
I hope you're enjoying this party, Carlos,

595
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,830
Because you're not gonna live to see another one.

596
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,460
Look, I'm sorry that I lied, and for what it's worth,

597
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,330
- The guilt has been tearing me apart.  - You know what's gonna tear me apart?

598
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,360
Another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.

599
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,330
Honey, look at it this way,

600
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
God blessed us again because you are such a great mom.

601
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,130
Oh. Get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch.

602
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,060
I told you I love you.

603
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,460
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

604
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,430
Yes. It means that someone forgot

605
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,030
That we had an agreement to keep things casual.

606
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,230
Wow. Okay.

607
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,660
So if we're not in a relationship,

608
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,060
If I was with another woman, that wouldn't bother you?

609
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
No, it wouldn't.

610
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,100
Mm.

611
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:51,460
Quiet, everyone.

612
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,060
She's coming. Move it.

613
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Surprise!

614
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,130
You think you can screw with me?

615
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:13,000
What do you mean?

616
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,560
Aah!

617
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,960
Karen, what the hell are you doing?

618
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,930
- Ask that husband of yours!  - No!

619
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,900
- Let's not be doing that.  -No, that man broke into my house tonight!

620
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:25,800
- What?  - Yes, and he...and he moved things around,

621
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,660
And he...and he took a picture off the wall,

622
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,360
And then he put the table next to the couch,

623
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,300
And the dish for the keys...it's always by the... Shh.

624
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,260
It's always by the door.

625
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,630
And that's not the first time he's broken in either.

626
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,560
He stole my cat, and then he put him back.

627
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,400
Okay, Mrs. Mccluskey, why would I do those things?

628
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,260
Karen, I hate to say it,

629
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,260
But you're not making a lot of sense right now.

630
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,630
Maybe you need to lie down.

631
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,260
- You...  - Hey!

632
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,100
I think we should call 9-1-1.

633
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:04,030
Let go of me!

634
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,830
Why are you all acting like I'm crazy?

635
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,000
Whoo-hoo!

636
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,760
Halle-damn-lujah, I got my period!

637
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,300
Oh, was she surprised?

638
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,700
She seemed totally disoriented, babbling.

639
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,860
I just hope it isn't dementia.

640
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,230
She lives by herself.

641
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,760
We'll alert the hospital.

642
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,030
- We're gonna need a psych evaluation.  - Thank you. Thank you.

643
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,260
Poor Karen. I hope she's okay.

644
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,700
Yeah, me, too.

645
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,160
We should probably talk now, huh?

646
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,830
Yeah. Let's talk.

647
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,460
Does this relationship have a future?

648
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,800
Jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well.

649
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,400
Answer the question.

650
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:10,760
Can't we just keep going the way we are?

651
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,800
And there's my answer.

652
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:27,060
It seems like they're taking good care of her.

653
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,730
I hope you didn't mean what you said earlier.

654
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,330
You just don't understand what I owe to Katherine

655
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,560
You're right. I don't.

656
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,060
You started the company

657
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,030
And gave her a job when she needed one badly.

658
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,500
Why are you the one who owes her?

659
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,600
You know that...

660
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,130
Brunch we had for you right before you left for prison?

661
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,930
I was very tense,


662
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,760
And I was very unhappy.

663
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,660
So I had...

664
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,030
A glass of champagne.

665
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,700
She's tough.

666
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,660
I'm sure she'll be okay.

667
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,200
How about the crazy married couple throwing drinks?

668
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,960
How are they gonna be?

669
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
You know,I just thought that you got it,

670
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,830
That you knew what I was going through after accident.

671
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,800
You know,obviously I was wrong.

672
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,660
No,I get it. The sports car,the garage band...

673
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,630
Maybe what we need now, Tom, is for you to get it.

674
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Hey,I was the one laying on the floor

675
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,630
With a cop pounding on my chest.

676
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,600
And I had cancer. I get it. I get it.

677
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,700
You want your life to count for something.

678
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,660
Exactly. I just don't want to keep making pizzas every day

679
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,700
Till I drop to the floor for real.

680
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:00,300
I want my life to be exciting. You know,I need adventure.

681
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,260
Scavo's was the adventure. We changed our whole lives

682
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,500
So you could live out your dream,and now you're bored.

683
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,460
We can't keep doing this,Tom.

684
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,430
We can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air

685
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,860
Every time you get a little restless.

686
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,530
Let's call it a night.

687
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,530
We have to work t omorrow.

688
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,000
Are you coming?

689
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,900
I'll come when I'm ready.

690
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,030
Did she really need an ambulance?

691
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,560
I don't know.

692
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,900
But you would have if I hadn't started my period.

693
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,460
How could you have done this?

694
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:56,930
- Isn't it obvious?  - I want another kid. We can't handle another kid.

695
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,060
- We're living hand to mouth as it is.  - That's what you said before we had Juanita

696
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,660
And before we had Celia,and somehow we manage.

697
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,630
And can you imagine our lives without them?

698
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,830
Of course I can't. It's just...

699
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
How could you have lied to me?

700
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,000
I just couldn't shake

701
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,130
the idea that maybe god had one more miracle in store for us.

702
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,500
Maybe a son.

703
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:25,430
And we have so much love in our lives,

704
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,060
I got greedy,and I wanted more.

705
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,600
But you're right.

706
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:34,360
It was selfish and stupid,and I am so sorry.

707
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,330
I will call tomorrow and schedule a vasectomy.

708
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,200
Or... We use birth control,

709
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:47,400
And I'm talking double-bagging,

710
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,400
At least until we both decide it's a good idea.

711
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,500
Wow.

712
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,330
I think I gotta kiss you.

713
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,560
And until we get a box of condoms in that house,

714
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,100
That's all you're getting.

715
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,660
Orson. What's up?

716
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,060
Bree told me what you did for her when I was in prison.

717
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,030
I just want to thank you.

718
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,530
It's nothing.

719
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,330
Not to Bree or me.

720
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,330
And you were dead right to stop her from telling me.

721
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,000
I'd consider it an honor to work for somebody that wise.

722
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,500
Work for?

723
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:32,960
The last I heard,it was partner.

724
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,760
All right,how's this?

725
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,760
I'll become a partner...

726
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,730
But only after you decide I've earned it.

727
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,230
I'm a patient man.

728
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,800
I don't care if it takes two years.

729
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,660
Oh,honey...

730
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,160
Working for Bree...

731
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,400
You're not gonna last ten months.

732
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,360
Mind if I say good-bye to our girl?

733
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,130
Sure,but she's a little groggy.

734
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:16,200
You planned the whole thing.

735
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,500
You're trying to get rid of me.

736
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,730
Yes.

737
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,260
And I'm sorry it had to be you.

738
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:30,130
'Cause I know you're up to something...

739
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,060
Something awful.

740
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,600
You don't know what "awful" is.

741
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,230
You take care of yourself, Karen,

742
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,900
And I mean that.

743
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:05,000
Yes,it was a night filled with surprises.

744
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,260
Some had learned

745
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,100
Of their husband's plans for the future...

746
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,830
Others had discovered the truth of their wife's past...

747
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,460
Some were touched by their husband's secret longings...

748
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,660
Others were hurt by their lover's quick departure.

749
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,160
But for one resident,

750
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,500
The evening had gone as planned,

751
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,230
And he now turned his thoughts to his real agenda.

752
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,560
It wouldn't be long now

753
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,660
Before he destroyed the man who had ruined his life,

754
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,800
But he knew he had to move carefully.

755
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:58,430
After all,he wanted it to be a surprise.
