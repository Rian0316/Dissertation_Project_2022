《少年谢尔顿》前情提要
Previously on Young Sheldon...

24
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,230
什么情况
What the hell's going on?

25
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,160
妈妈觉得我疯了
Mom thinks that I'm crazy.

26
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,450
我们不是说好不提这种字眼吗
I thought we weren't supposed to say stuff like that.

27
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,460
宝贝  有件事我得告诉你
Baby, there's something I need to tell you.

28
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,970
斯特吉斯博士
Dr. Sturgis

29
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,270
不是住进了你想的那种医院
is not in the kind of hospital you think he is.

30
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,330
那他是在哪种医院
What kind of hospital is he in?

31
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,630
精神病院
The psychiatric kind.

32
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,880
你觉得因为我和他都有天赋
And you think since he and I are both gifted,

33
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,500
我以后也会变成他那样吗
I'm going to end up like him?

34
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,020
宝贝
Oh, baby.

35
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,040
看见没  一点沟通就能有巨大的效果
See how valuable a little communication can be?

36
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,780
这事你屁功劳都没有
You do not take credit for this.

37
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,920
你永远不会知道科学灵感何时会来临
You never know where scientific inspiration will strike.

38
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,160
牛顿是坐在苹果树下时
For Newton, it was under an apple tree.

39
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,680
阿基米德是坐在浴缸里时
For Archimedes, it was sitting in a bathtub.

40
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,890
而我呢  在那一天
For me, on this particular day,

41
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,260
感觉会在"流汗的人们吃着肉"时来灵感
it had a "Sweaty people eating meat" kind of vibe.

42
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,510
谢尔顿  你一定要在这里搞这些吗
Sheldon, do you really have to do that here?

43
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,300
如果店里的人不想我解开统一场论
If the management didn't want me to solve unified field theory,

44
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,010
那他们为什么要给我蜡笔呢
why would they give me a crayon?

45
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,590
我就跟你说车窗开个缝  把他留车上吧
I told you to crack a window and leave him in the car.

46
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,550
我灵光一闪
It occurred to me

47
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,890
如果麦克斯韦方程组中加入一个磁单极子
that Maxwell's equations would achieve full symmetry

48
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,050
就能达到完全对称
by adding a magnetic monopole.

49
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,030
我画了一只瓢虫
I drew a ladybug.

50
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,300
好啦好啦
All right, y'all.

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,700
我可以把菜放下吗
Oh... ‭Is it okay to set this down?

52
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,790
我现在这里正忙着  你能等会再上菜吗
I'm a little busy. Could you come back later?

53
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,080
谢尔顿  我很饿了
Sheldon, I'm hungry.

54
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,490
我们坐过去隔壁桌吧
Let's just sit over there.

55
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,090
不行  我们一家得坐同一桌一起用餐
No. We're gonna eat together as a family.

56
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,740
这样就不是电力  而是电磁力
Instead of electricity, we'll have magnetricity.

57
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,150
我快举不动了
It's getting heavy.

58
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,710
我们就坐隔壁  有事就叫我们
We'll be right over here if you need us.

59
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,910
过去吧
Let's go.

60
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,770
再见啦  小瓢虫
Bye, ladybug.

61
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,100
宝贝  你必须得吃点东西
Baby, you need to eat something.

62
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,050
感觉我可以改变
But it looks like I can change the definitions

63
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,750
电力与电磁场的定义
of electric and magnetic fields

64
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,730
这样磁荷这个变量就不会为0
and rotate the magnetic charge away mathematically to zero.

65
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,540
或许吃一点炸秋葵会有帮助
Maybe some fried okra would help.

66
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,030
理查德·费曼发明量子电动力学时
Richard Feynman didn't develop quantum electrodynamics

67
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,550
靠的可不是吃炸秋葵
by filling up on fried okra.

68
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,770
那可能是因为他妈妈爱他的程度
Well, maybe that's because his mama didn't love him

69
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,490
没有我爱你那么深啊
as much as I love you.

70
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,080
理查德·费曼是犹太人
Richard Feynman was Jewish.

71
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,650
他的妈妈才不可能给他吃炸秋葵[黑人菜]
His mother didn't give him fried okra.

72
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,850
我是漏了哪里呢
Ugh. What am I missing?

73
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,590
你再吵醒我一次
Wake me up one more time,

74
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,830
我就往你手套里打喷嚏
and I will sneeze in your mittens.

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,890
打一个带鼻涕的大喷嚏进去
A big, wet, snotty one.

76
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,680
小宝贝  你在干嘛呢
Baby, what are you doing?

77
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,800
做事
Working.

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,670
你是一整晚没睡待在这里吗
Have you been out here all night?

79
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,010
没有啊  怎么这么问  现在几点了
No. Why, what time is it?

80
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,320
7点30
7:30.

81
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,940
那我是待了一晚
Oh. Then yes.

82
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,560
我了个...
Son of a...

83
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,900
老爸  你在忙吗
Dad, you busy?

84
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,770
我表情看起来像在忙吗
Do I look like I'm busy?

85
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,500
你在水槽底下  我看不见你表情啊
I can't see what you look like. You're under the sink.

86
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,380
找我什么事
What do you want?

87
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
你可以教我怎么投球吗
Would you teach me how to throw a baseball?

88
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,220
怎么突然想学了
What's bringing this on?

89
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,190
我也不知道  就感觉挺好玩
I don't know, just seems fun.

90
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,080
行啊  有何不可
Sure, why not?

91
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,600
太好了  我去拿手套
Great, I'll get the gloves.

92
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,110
不是现在
Not now!

93
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,250
有什么新鲜事啊
So, what's new?

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,090
我有点担心谢尔顿
I'm worried about Sheldon.

95
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,110
我说了是"新鲜事"
I said "new."

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,680
他都不睡觉  也不吃饭
He's not sleeping, he's not eating.

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,250
我们昨晚出门吃烧烤
We went out for barbecue last night,

98
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,720
他一口都没吃
and he didn't touch a thing.

99
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,460
他还开始咬指甲了
He also started biting his nails.

100
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,280
我从没看过他有这习惯
I've never seen him do that before.

101
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,860
他心里有什么烦恼吗
Is he worried about something?

102
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,530
他一心想着一个科学的问题
He's fixated on some science problem.

103
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,790
我确定他会解开的
Well, I'm sure he'll solve it

104
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,630
然后一切就会变回原来那样
and then everything will go back to normal.

105
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,040
希望如此
I hope so.

106
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,750
约翰最近怎么样了
What's going on with John?

107
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,720
一切如常
Not much.

108
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,110
我们就书信往来
We write letters back and forth.

109
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,350
那很浪漫啊
That's romantic.

110
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,370
他是上前线写信才浪漫啊
Romantic if he were off to war,

111
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,390
他进精神病院有什么浪漫的
not in a mental hospital.

112
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,480
他也是在跟心魔打仗啊
Well, he's at war with his inner demons.

113
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,520
-你是右撇子吧  -你不知道吗
- You're right-handed, yeah? - You don't know?

114
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,490
行啊  聪明鬼  那我是左撇子还右撇子
Okay, smartass, which one am I?

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,280
我是右撇子
I'm right-handed.

116
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,530
那把手套戴上你的左手
Put this on your left hand.

117
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,040
你以前投过球吗
You ever thrown a ball before?

118
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,730
只用石头丢过谢尔顿
Just rocks at Sheldon.

119
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,120
有丢中吗
Did you hit him?

120
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,300
每次都中了
Every time.

121
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,730
很好  那我们算有些基础
So, we got something to work with.

122
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,170
好  根据我新学到的  你是右撇子
All right, since you're right-handed, which I now know,

123
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,590
你要把你的右手臂举起
you're gonna bring your arm up

124
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,180
然后顺着这动作丢出去
and follow through like this.

125
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,740
好
Okay.

126
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,390
很棒  你可能很有天赋
Nice. You might be a natural.

127
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,110
我不意外  这可是我平常画画上色的那只手
I'm not surprised. This is the arm I color with.

128
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,200
我都没意识到我在啃手指
I wasn't even aware I was chewing them.

129
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,290
宝贝  我觉得这个数学题
Baby, I think this math problem

130
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,520
你为了解开  把自己逼过头了
you're working on is stressing you out.

131
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,700
很有可能  毕竟爱因斯坦辛苦了30年
It makes sense. Einstein struggled with it for 30 years

132
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,490
最后都还是没有解开
and never found a solution.

133
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,490
或许你先别想  放一放  之后灵感就来了呢
Maybe if you stop thinking about it, it'll just come to you.

134
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,590
-不  我不能停下  -谢尔顿
- No. I can't stop. ‭- Sheldon.

135
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,230
如果我停下  就会失去动力
If I stop, I'll lose momentum.

136
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,950
然后就永远解不开  我就会是个失败者
I'll never solve it. I'll be a failure.

137
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,290
我的人生就会比咸鱼还不如
My life will be worthless.

138
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,470
好了够了  你必须停止搞科学一阵子
Okay, that's it. You're taking a break from science.

139
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,060
给我一个应该这么做的好理由
Give me one good reason why I would do that.

140
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,480
斯特吉斯博士现在沦落到哪了
Where is Dr. Sturgis right now?

141
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,890
这是个好理由
That's a good reason.

142
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,470
你要记得  眼睛盯着
All right, remember, you need to look

143
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,850
你想要球飞过去的落点
right where you want the ball to go.

144
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,020
不然我还能看哪里
Where else would I look?

145
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,220
光是刚才五分钟
Well, in the last five minutes,

146
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,780
我就看到你看了蝴蝶
I saw you watch a butterfly,

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,330
一只松鼠  还有卖冰激凌的卡车
a squirrel and the ice cream truck.

148
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,440
你自己也看了冰激凌卡车啊
You looked at the ice cream truck, too.

-是受我们喜爱的队伍吗  -是啊
- Is that a team we like? - Uh, yeah.

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,140
这里大多数的人都支持他们
Yeah, that's who most people around here root for.

153
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,100
那如果要聊这队  我可以说些什么呢
Okay. And what's something I could say about the Rangers?

154
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,710
说出来会让人惊叹的
You know, to sound cool.

155
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,770
-这是跟小男生有关吗  -不是
- Is this about a boy? - ‭No.

156
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,280
抱歉  是我误会了
All right, sorry.

157
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,460
如果想聊  你可以说"虽然诺兰·莱恩老了
If you want, you could say, "Even though Nolan Ryan is old,

158
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,800
但游骑兵队招揽他来十分明智"
the Rangers were still smart to get him."

159
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,140
真有这回事吗
That's a real thing?

160
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,320
这是真的
That's a real thing.

161
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,580

美国职棒大联盟史上第一的三振王
1947年出生  1993年在游骑兵队退休

163
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,940
我这年纪
My age.

164
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,830
恶心
Ew.

165
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,990
我太习惯整天想着科学了
I'm so used to thinking about science,

166
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,910
我不知道该怎么让自己停下
I'm not sure how to make myself stop.

167
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,900
一旦我开始想着
As soon as I think about

168
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,370
我要不想科学  我就又重新开始想了
not thinking about it, I'm thinking about it.

169
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,550
那你为什么不想点别的呢
Well, why don't you just think about something else?

170
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,630
-比如呢  -不知道啊
- Like what? ‭- I don't know.

171

当绿魔在飞...
When the Green Goblin flies...

177

-我说行了  -是科学

我知道你不会想听这个

但我发现祈祷可以给心灵带来无上平静
but I find prayer can bring incredible peace of mind.

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,490
别闹了  玛丽  我在想办法帮这孩子呢
Come on, Mary, I'm trying to help the kid.

181
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,560
你需要一个新爱好

182
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,930
很好  那你有什么爱好
Very well. What are yours?

抽烟  喝酒  赌博
Smoking, drinking and gambling.

184
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,340

I'm wondering if you have any books

231
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,750
戒掉坏习惯的书

233
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,020
-科学  -妈呀
- Science. - ‭Yowza,

234
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,120
不是永远戒掉啦
It's not permanent.

235
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,630
我只是想放下一段时间
I'm just looking to take a break.

236
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,420
这话我以前听过
I've heard that one before.

237

你放下过什么
What did you take a break from?

我尝试了几种不同的活动
I've tried a few different activities,

241
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,460
但不管我做什么  最终都把我引回科学
but whatever I do just leads me back to science.

242
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,350
我们来想想看  什么是跟科学截然相反的
Well, let's think about it. What's the opposite of science?

243
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,970
科学基于事实
Science is based in facts,

244
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,200
事实的对立面就是虚构作品
and the opposite of facts is fiction.

245
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,640
奇幻小说怎么样
How about fantasy?

246
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,120
有魔法和龙
Magic and dragons.

247
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,790
图书馆里有一整区都是这个分类
We have a whole section here.

248
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,160
听上去智商就要破底了
Ooh, that sounds intellectually bankrupt.

249
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,610
我愿意试一试
I'll give it a shot.

250
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,760
好消息
Good news.

251
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,960
我找到方法暂时放下科学了
I found a way to take a break from science.

252
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,840
太好了  什么方式
That's great. What is it?

253
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,080
叫《指环王[主]》的长篇奇幻小说
A fantasy book series called The Lord of the Rings.

254
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,450
至少书名里含有"主"
Well, it's got "The Lord" in it.

255
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,920
很了不起了
That's something.

256
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,860
刚才这一投还带了旋啊
That one had some zip on it.

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,080
带旋是好事吧
Zip's a good thing, right?

258
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,060
是的
Yes.

259
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,360
所以看起来我像懂行的吗
So it looks like I know what I'm doing?

260
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,270
跟职业球手没两样
Just like a pro.

261
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,090
但是淑女职业球手
But like a lady pro?

262
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,170
当然  非常淑女
Oh, yes. Very much.

263
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,520
还有什么游骑兵队的好话是我能说的
Is there anything else good I could say about the Rangers?

264
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,660
我想想啊
Uh, let's see.

265
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,530
告诉有兴趣的人
Tell whoever's interested

266
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,810
绝对没人能撼动诺兰·莱恩的三振出局纪录
that no one's ever gonna touch Nolan Ryan's strikeout record.

267
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,680
因为他经常被三振出局
'Cause he strikes out all the time.

268
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,790
不是的
No.

269
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,260
因为他经常投出好球  让对手三振出局
Because he throws ‭strikeouts all the time.

270
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,790
差别很大
Oh. Big difference.

271
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,270
晚饭好了
Dinner's ready.

272
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,110
再五分钟行吗
Five more minutes?

273
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,760
她想跟亲亲老爸再玩五分钟嘛
She wants five more minutes with her ole dad.

274
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,160
他们在外面干什么
What are they doing out there?

275
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,700
联络感情  那很棒  谢尔顿  书看得怎么样
They're bonding. It's great. Sheldon, how's your book?

276
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,820
话题转得真硬
Nice pivot.

277
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,600
非常棒  有个叫咕噜的人物
Excellent. There's a character named Gollum

278
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,310
被力量之戒吞蚀了心智
who was corrupted by the Ring of Power.

279
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,570
现在他光着身子到处乱跑  还喜欢一口咬掉鱼头
Now he runs around naked and bites the heads off fish.

280
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,110
那叫寿司
That's called sushi.

281
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,200
不过说真的  我宁死也不吃那玩意
Which, by the way, I will die before I eat.

282
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,130
说到死  你死了之后
Speaking of dying, when you do,

283
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,550
你的车能给我吗
can I have your car?

284
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,160
这不可能啊
This can't be right.

285
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,290
又怎么了
What now?

286
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,290
甘道夫在跃马旅店
In the letter that Gandalf leaves for Frodo

287
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,580
留给佛罗多的信上说  那天是年中日[6月22日]
at The Prancing Pony, he says that it's Mid-year's Day,

288
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,860
夏尔纪年1418年
Shire year 1418.

289
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,560
然而在附录二里  写着甘道夫于6月29日
However, in Appendix B, it says that Gandalf met Radagast

290
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,460
遇到褐袍瑞达加斯特  那是不可能的  因为...
on June 29, which is impossible because...

291
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,650
喂
Hey!

292
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,180
下次丢的就是老娘的鞋子
Next time, it's my shoe.

293
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,350
我还会带上旋
And I will put zip on it.

294
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,330
"住在镇上的男人个子很高"
"The man who lived in the town was tall."

295
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,480
这句话里哪个词是关系代词
Which word is the relative pronoun?

296
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,710
谢尔顿
Sheldon.

297
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,010
你读过《指环王》吗
Have you read The Lord of the Rings?

298
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,100
读过
Um, I have,

299
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,240
但我们现在不是在讨论这个
but that's not what we're really doing right now.

300
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,660
关系代词是"who"
The relative pronoun is "who."

301
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,350
你有没发现在《护戒使者》里
Now, did you notice that in Fellowship,

302
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,550
埃尔隆德说巴拉多的地基
Elrond says that the foundations of Barad-dur

303
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,280
由至尊魔戒所建成
were made with the One Ring?

304
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,940
就当做是吧
Let's say sure.

305
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,550
然而在附录二《纪年传说》中  显然
However, in Appendix B, "The Tale of Years," It's clear that

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,400
魔王索伦于第二纪元1000年开始建造巴拉多
Sauron began building Barad-dûr in Second Age 1000,

307
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,530
那比铸造魔戒还早了600年
600 years before the ring was forged.

308
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,630
小乔治
Georgie.

309
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,650
想象一下跟这奇葩一起生活
Imagine living with this.

310
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,780
每天一小时就够我受的了
An hour a day is enough.

311
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,610
时间线根本说不通啊
The timeline doesn't make sense.

312
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,890
山姆·詹吉的出生年份既有2963
I mean, it lists Samwise Gamgee's birth year as both

313
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,810
也有2980
2963 and 2980.

314
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,630
或许他谎报年龄了
Maybe he lied about his age.

315
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,560
-为什么  -我也不知道  或许
- Why? ‭- I don't know. Maybe he thinks

316
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,030
他认为他的颈纹让他显老
his neck makes him look older than he is.

317
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,880
但他才三十几岁
But he's only in his 30s.

318
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,030
还很年轻
That's young.

319
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,390
谢谢你啦
Thank you.

320
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,300
对霍比特人而言  人类到这岁数就是大妈了
For a hobbit. For a human, that's mommy-age.

321
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,160
谢你全家
Thank you.

322
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,160
当佛罗多和山姆骑马穿过夏尔时
When Frodo and Sam are riding through the Shire,

323
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,960
书里说月亮往西移动了
the book says the moon went westward,

324
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,730
但根据托尔金创作的历法
but according to the calendar Tolkien created,

325
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,240
当时不应该能看见月亮
there should have been no moon visible.

326
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,400
但在附录里  托尔金辩解道
But in the appendix, Tolkien covers himself

327
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,520
《西界红皮书》的翻译可能有误
by saying there may be mistranslations from the Red Book.

328
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,010
这是小说里的托尔金说的
Fictional Tolkien says that,

329
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,880
但我很想知道  是不是该书作者
but I can't help wondering if real Tolkien,

330
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,170
真正的托尔金犯了这个错
who wrote the book, made the mistake

331
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,840
还是这是小说版托尔金
or if it was an intentional mistake

332
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,010
他根据原始来源翻译出
made by the fictional Tolkien,

333
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,620
这些真实世界的事件时
who translated these real-world events

334
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,410
故意犯的错
from an original source.

335
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,780
妈呀
Oh, no.

336
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,640
别人听我说话时也是这感受吗
Is that how I sound to people?

337
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,040
闺女  你想玩投球吗
Hey! You want to throw the ball around?

338
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,950
不要  走开
No, go away.

339
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,020
学校里出什么事了吗
Did something happen at school?

340
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,230
我不想说
I don't want to talk about it.

341
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,250
好吧
Okay. Well...

342
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,900
如果你想谈  我随时都在
You change your mind, you know I'm here for you.

343
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,410
他喜欢别人
He likes someone else.

344
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,710
你说什么  宝贝
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

345
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,290
她连诺兰·莱恩是谁都不知道
She doesn't even know who Nolan Ryan is.

346
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,620
这男生听起来是个大白痴
This guy sounds like an idiot.

347
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,410
他才不是  他很完美
He's not. He's perfect.

348
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,570
好吧
All right.

349
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,490
想让我叫妈妈来吗
Want me to get your mom?

350
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,700
不要
No.

351
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,130
想让我去揍他一顿吗
You want me to beat this guy up?

352
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,210
不要
No.

353
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,830
我能做什么
What can I do?

354
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,880
真不错
Nice.

355
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,830
怎么投出曲球啊
How do you make it curve?

356
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,680
这有点难度
Well, that's a little tricky.

357
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,190
把两根手指压在接缝上
You... you put two fingers on the seam.

358
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,730
看到了吗  然后转动手腕
Right? And then you flick your wrist.

359
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,640
-好  -知道了吗  来  试一下
- Okay. - ‭Yeah? Here, try it.

360
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,030
两根...  放这里啊
Two... Oh, so there.

361
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,890
这就对了  放在接缝上
There you go, right on the stitch there.

362
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,470
两根手指放在上面
Two fingers on it.

363
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,760
-然后球脱手前一刻  转动手腕  -这样吗
- Then at the end, you flick your wrist. - ‭Like that?

364
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,640
就是这样  投一个试试
There you go. Give her a shot.

365
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,150
还挺厉害啊
Hey! How about that?

366
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,820
对吧  我就说了跟职业球手没两样
Right? Just like a pro, I'm telling you.

367
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,690
我们要再多练习
Well, we'll work on that, shall we?

368
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,790
绝对的
Definitely. ‭

369
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,030
不错
Nice.

370
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,260
遍寻答案无果后
Having found no answers,

371
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,540
我决定自己纠正
I took it upon myself to rectify

372
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,700
《指环王》中前后矛盾的时间线
the inconsistent timeline in Lord of the Rings.

373
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,390
J.R.R.托尔金是很聪明没错
J.R.R. Tolkien had a brilliant mind,

374
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,630
但老实说
but let's be honest.

375
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,960
他跟S.L.库珀比差远了
He was no S.L. Cooper.

376
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,090
你还好吧
You okay out here?

377
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,140
等我完成这个就会好了
I will be once I finish this.

378
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,050
纵使我很努力想排列出前后一致的年表
As hard as I tried to work out a consistent chronology,

379
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,410
我还是不断遇到障碍
I kept running into roadblocks.

380
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,670
我漏掉了什么
What am I missing?

381
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,970
我们永远都不会想明白的
We're never going to figures it out.

382
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,220
我们可以的  我们很聪明  我们绝顶聪明
We can, we're smarts. We're so smarts.

383
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,210
我们的大脑就是宝贝
Our brains is precious.

384
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,440
如果我们的大脑是宝贝
If our brains is precious,

385
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,460
那都浪费在霍比特人身上了
we're wasting it on hobbitses.

386
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,000
我们喜欢科学
We like sciences.

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
我们暂时放下科学了
We took a break from sciences.

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,730
科学快把我们逼疯了
It was making us crazy.

389
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,250
结果我们现在成什么样子了
And look at us now.

390
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,970
瞧那些恶心的霍比特人对我们做了什么
Look at what those nasty hobbitses have done to us.

391
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,040
不  是物理
No, it was physicses.

392
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,300
是物理害我们变成这样
Physicses did this to us.

393
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,360
是霍比特人
Hobbitses.

394
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,550
是物理
Physicses.

395
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,300
霍比特人
Hobbitses.

396
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,760
我警告过你的
I warned you.

397
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,180
妈妈  妈妈
Mom. Mom.

398
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,450
怎么了
‭What's wrong?

399
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,570
我变成咕噜和史麦戈了  在一个山洞里
I was Gollum and Smeagol and I was in a cave

400
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,980
跟我自己争辩物理和霍比特人
fighting with myself over physics and hobbits.

401
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,640
但之后我意识到  虽然物理使我崩溃沮丧
And then I realized that even though physics is frustrating,

402
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,600
但它不会把我变成受尽折磨
it won't turn me into a tormented creature

403
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
爱把鱼头生生咬下来的怪物
who bites the heads off fish.

404
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,280
说完了  晚安
Okay, good night.

405
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,840
我给米希当好爸爸了
I've been doing a great job with Missy.

406
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,480
你去给他当好妈妈
This one's on you.
