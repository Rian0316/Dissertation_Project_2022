1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,850
纽约城的周六晚

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,210
年轻的城里人都纷纷出门...

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,010
体验纽约才有的疯狂生活方式

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,430
100!

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,740
100次? 我们度蜜月时才82次

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,970
Robin? 我想介绍个男人给你

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,100
他很可爱 风趣 很聪明

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,370
他的"但是"(缺点)呢?

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,080
你什么意思?

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,070
有人想为你介绍朋友时 
总会先告诉你对方的优点

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,220
但他们故意不提对方的严重缺陷

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,560
她绝对性感 绝对幽默

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,660
但是她有颗坏牙

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,510
她性感无比 还事业有成

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
但是她喜欢把哈巴狗放婴儿车里
到处推着跑

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,840
她太可爱了 极其聪明

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,610
但是她最近一任男友不得不
把她关在家里


18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,280
接着他的猫和真空吸尘器就不翼而飞了

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,970
哇 介绍给我!

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,480
我仍然确信她杀死了我的海龟

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,080
嘿 知道不? 
不是所有的相亲都有个"但是"

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
那个...Jamie 怎么说?
Lily介绍给你的?

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,600
- 对哦
- 她人真的很好

24
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,870
如果我没记错的话 她有大大的"但是"

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,130
她的屁股太大了
("但是"和"屁股"在英文里谐音)

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,100
- 一语中的!
- 对哦

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,700
这家伙毫无缺点

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,070
他真是个好人 真的很可爱

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,970
- 但是?
- 好吧

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,660
但是他有个孩子

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,950
就是说嘛!

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
Robin不会和有孩子的男人出去

33
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,270
但他真的很出色 他孩子也很可爱

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,170
他在我的班上

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,240
那不重要 Robin痛恨孩子

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,920
我不恨孩子

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,170
你告诉我 说你还是孩子时就恨孩子了

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,930
Robin 你能和我一起看卡通片吗?

39
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,900
我整个礼拜都要上学

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,910
我就不能留5分钟给自己 
看看报纸大标题 喝点橙汁吗?

41
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,330
好吧  孩子不是我最喜欢的 
但我喜欢他们

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,880
你不想要孩子

43
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,260
我喜欢跑车 但这不代表我就想
自己生一辆法拉利出来

44
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,890
这我早说过了

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,980
你不能因为我们把孩子看做麻烦
就责怪我们

46
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,000
如果我们是加菲猫的朋友
就不会安排它和星期一去相亲

47
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,950
很好

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,730
你们知道不? 孩子不是问题

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,600
我要去见见这家伙

50
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,070
- 很好 真酷
- 是啊

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,980
那我的"但是"呢? 我是个...

52
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,330
我真得很不错 但是...

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,220
但是她害怕承诺

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,750
但是她爱枪成痴

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,290
但是她是加拿大人

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,240
但是她不爱看《梦幻之地》(电影名)

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,140
- 我想不出...
- 你没有"但是"

58
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,190

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,190
翻译: SharonTang 雨池

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,090

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,970
好吧  我搞到手了

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,870
Here. Put on this eye patch.
给 戴上这眼罩

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,550
Why?
干嘛?

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,930
终极破冰人

65
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,830
一群眼镜蛇游走在中央公园

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,480
你和我正在慢跑...

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,610
为成为死亡峡谷的钢铁超人受训 
没啥大不了的

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,180
我们每年都要训练

69
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,320
突然 我们看到这些该死的小蛇
正游向一个小婴儿

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,700
虽然我们并不当班

71
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,920
你抓住孩子 我空手扼死六条响尾蛇

72
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,230
纽约的女士们 一次上一位 拜托大家了

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,860
那么眼罩是怎么回事?

74
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,950
我们被蛇咬了

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
- 咬在眼睛上了?
- 对

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,700
两个都咬了?

77
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,900
咬到不同的眼睛了

78
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,070
我看不出这怎么惹着你了

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,080
戴上眼罩!

80
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,120
Robin去和George约会了
那家伙有一个孩子 后来...

81
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,390
好吧 这就是问题所在

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,980
George是个好男人 我们玩得很高兴

83
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,380
但是?

84
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,040
太好了 我等不及见到他

85
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,300
等不及见到他?

86
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
我干嘛要说那句话?

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,270
我不想见他的孩子

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,500
你知道 你早晚得见他

89
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,050
我只想以后见他 比如再过20年
我是钓小帅哥的老妇 他长到他爸那样性感

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,550
Rboin 那有什么关系?

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,740
他只是个孩子 他不会咬你

92
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,660
也许他会咬人 
我们正教育他们不要咬人

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,160
为什么孩子会在她身边?
他不该和妈妈在一起吗?

94
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,500
什么样的律师能整天照顾孩子?

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,690
好的律师 他赢得了监护权

96
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,550
他赢得了? 是他赢到的? 

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,320
上帝 得到孩子就是获胜 是不是?

98
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,210
- 别告诉别人我这样说
- 当然了

99
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,370
我出去买了眼罩

100
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,260
你打算怎么做赢得美眉芳心?

101
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,690
好吧 我要告诉你点小秘密

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,520
真正的游戏中 玩家不需要眼罩

103
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,440
瞧这德行

104
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,100
不 不 不

105
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,030
没有我 你都不知道游戏怎么玩
我是最棒的游戏高手

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
我玩过太多游戏了 
我是Cornish游戏鸡(即童子鸡)

107
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,400
是吗? 我是纽约州游戏专员

108
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,540
那我就是游戏了

109
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,420
制作精湛 悬念引人 卡司强大
Michael Douglas和Sean Penn领衔主演

110
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,630
你们在这里 没去厕所啊

111
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,140
对 怎么了?

112
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,850
我也许和某个穿的鞋与你们相同的人
发表了番关于同志的不恰当言论

113
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,140
- 好吧 Marshall?
- 我在

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,780
我们俩谁赢的游戏多?

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,700
你们谁都没赢过 行了吧?
否则你们就象我这样 结婚了

116
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,040
什么?

117
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,960
如果约会是游戏 结婚就是游戏获胜

118
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,140
没错 如果你玩的是女人游戏

119
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,720
你开玩笑 我的游戏玩得棒极了 兄弟

120
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,230
行了 第一: 我们赞同不再说"兄弟"

121
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,670
这周不错 我们玩得很高兴 但结束了

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,920
第二: 你和Lily在一起有11年了

123
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,940
你对好游戏的想法就是
戴上苏斯博士(儿童文学作家)的帽子

124
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,970
亮出两张Spin Doctor的音乐会门票
(90年代初的摇滚乐队名)

125
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,570
我不想这么说 但你有点过时了

126
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,190
什么? 我可没过时

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,060
我有很多点子 我能帮到你们

128
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,110
我不想被排除在外

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,230
Ted 你玩过的游戏不比我多

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,510
仅仅在Sheerbers 我就赢你了

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,300
得了 朋友 你看过我的征服者名单

132
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,710
你们想听听我的故事吗?

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,620
首先 我居然没被邀请看那份名单 
我仍感到惊诧莫名

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,490
真正的游戏在乎质量 而不是数量

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,480
任何时候 上档次的女孩总喜欢选我
而不是你

136
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,670
你是模特吗?

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,930
说得真动听 是句恭维话

138
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,750
对女孩来说

139
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,470
- Ted 我向你挑战 进行一次钓美眉奥运会
- 没问题

140
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,160
在11周内 展开26项竞赛

141
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,260
我们将去一个中立城市 
由一个国际裁判团...

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,510
或者我们只挑一个女孩
看谁先勾上手 谁就是赢家?

143
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
那也不错

144
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,130
就她 怎么样?

145
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,540
同意

146
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,950
我们开始前 干嘛不确定基本规则呢?

147
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,860
很好 不许戴眼罩 或任何其他道具...

148
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,190
有一次 我碰到某个女孩 
我试了你那个模特的说法

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,740
我隔着衣服看到她的胸部激突了

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,790
伙计 别说了 你唠唠叨叨
快把人都赶跑了

151
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,570
规则二-- 赌注为100万美元

152
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,710
- 我赢了
- 怎么赢的?

153
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,160
我和她睡过 大概一年前

154
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,310
我刚才忘记了

155
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,570
那不算数

156
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,610
赌约从我们握手那刻开始

157
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,150
但我不能再和她睡了 她恨我

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,080
有意思 看看现在谁大幅领先了

159
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,920
没你干扰 我就能享受甜蜜时光了

160
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,870
Ted 她就要走了

161
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,870
别挡着道

162
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,200
根据那鞋子的式样 你的厕所朋友来了

163
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,420
看看谁赢了比赛

164
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,550
那么说 你是个喜欢孩子的人 哈?

165
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,410
我最最喜欢孩子了

166
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,110
我觉得孩子太伟大了 特别是 小娃娃

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,000
你知道的...小胖墩 还坐不起来
牙齿都没长出来时

168
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,930
- 牙牙学语的婴儿?
- 对 我就喜欢那样的

169
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,510
Doug差不多要6岁了 所以...

170
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,190
哦 6岁太棒了

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,610
你会喜欢6岁孩子的

172
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,050
6岁就是当他们真正开始 呃...

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,060
我讨厌孩子

174
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,960
抱歉 你说什么?

175
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,940
我是说 我不恨孩子

176
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,920
我- 我只是不喜欢孩子

177
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,520
我是说 对 他们的鞋子真是小得可爱

178
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,650
但除此以外 还有什么吸引人的?

179
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,130
- 你一定觉得我是个怪人
- 什么? 不 不 不

180
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,500
我...那么说你不喜欢孩子 那又怎样?

181
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,250
我没在为Doug找母亲

182
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,770
我们干嘛不推迟见他的时间呢?

183
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,290
是啊 慢慢来

184
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,060
孩子 那正是她要面对的

185
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,050
于是 在另一天--绝不是次天清晨

186
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,090
Robin不得不面对她最恐惧的场面

187
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,190
嘿 什么事?

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,730
它就在这里 Lily

189
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,920
它正朝我看

190
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,400
那个孩子 我该怎么办?

191
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,510
只要和他聊聊就好 你能做到的 Robin

192
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,220
你是谁?

193
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,590
我是Robin

194
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,790
那是鸟的名字
(Robin有知更鸟的意思)

195
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,060
不 不是 事实上 它只是鸟的一个种类

196
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,710
我朋友Patrick有只长尾小鹦鹉就叫Robin
所以这么说

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,190
你想用摩尔斯电码来说话吗?

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,980
朋友 我是- 我只是在看报纸 所以...

199
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,570
我饿死了 你能为我做麦片吗?

200
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,770
当然可以

201
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,900
你在干什么? 你该先倒牛奶的

202
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,020
什么? 不 你该先倒麦片 
这样你就知道该放多少牛奶了

203
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,690
先放牛奶 味道更好!

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,520
一旦倒进碗里 尝起来就是一个味了

205
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,750
你干嘛穿我爸爸的裤子?

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,090
那就先放牛奶吧

207
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,800
你在看什么?

208
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,710
商业版

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,960
美联储将降低利率以刺激次优抵押贷款

210
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,510
一堆傻瓜

211
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Aldrin小姐说骂人不好

212
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,480
如果他们不是傻瓜 我就不会那样叫他们

213
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,170
我当时也这么说

214
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,350
你真酷

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,970
你也是

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,390
与此同时 Stacey和我开始约会

217
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,430
Stacey就是酒吧里那女孩

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,060
无论如何 我快要成功时 
意想不到的事发生了

219
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,050
我开始喜欢上她了

220
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,760
瑜珈课开心

221
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,680
她正在增强她的核心力量

222
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,540
我觉得那会很棒

223
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,950
是吗? 好的

224
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,710
过一会见 鳄鱼

225
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,010
看到这个了吗?

226
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,220
游戏大王

227
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,600
随你说吧 Ted

228
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,530
看看这个

229
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,810
她在一个雷吉乐队当贝司手

230
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,960
他们周五有场演出

231
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,350
很了不起吧?

232
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,870
她知道那首歌吗?

233
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,760
Mm-mm,chaka,mm-mm,chaka 

234
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,240
这歌叫什么名来着?

235
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,050
对了 它就叫"每一首雷吉歌"

236
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,050
- 我没跑题
- 什么?

237
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,450
我算过数字了

238
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,480
如果我和Lily每周2次作爱 坦率说 
我们都知道这数字太保守了

239
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,980
我们在一起10年了 加上蜜月时17次多

240
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,210
减去2周无性生活 因为我说杂货店的店员
很象年轻时的Lily

241
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,300
- 这样我们的作爱次数总共--等等
- 不错

242
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,890
1053又二分之一次

243
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,840
那半次是我妈打电话来

244
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,360
但比Barney的总做爱次数多多了

245
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,250
根据你的观点 Ted, 
Lily是个上档次的女孩

246
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,880
我赢了

247
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,440
法定胜利

248
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,350
不算数

249
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,700
- 当然算数
- 你是对的

250
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,700
它算数 只能算一次

251
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,600
你只有过一次性约会 怎么样?

252
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,710
我还是不错

253
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,290
好吧 Ted 去赢下赌注吧

254
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,030
我祝福你 她是个好姑娘

255
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,500
我该知道的

256
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,790
好的

257
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,910
好吧 我知道你打什么主意

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,160
我们从来没分享过女人 对吗 Ted?
那不是很有意思吗?

259
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,100
现在是你和她在一起

260
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,680
一年前 我和她在一起

261
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,370
你自己算算 对她来说 
就是洗200次淋浴之前的事

262
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,890
你扪心自问一下 洗200次够了吗?

263
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,540
知道不?

264
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,640
我才不介意呢

265
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,520
是啊 你当然不介意了

266
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,145
就象第二个爬上珠穆朗玛峰的人
历经千辛万苦攀上顶峰...

267
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,790
只发现Edmund Hillary爵士的旗杆
深深地插入柔软顺从的顶峰

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,190
不 我确定你和她在一起时
你才不会想到我呢

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,780
亲吻我早已亲吻过的地方

270
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,580
爱抚我早已爱抚过的地方 做...

271
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,040
做我早就做过的事

272
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,810
- Barney 我不怕抓你留下的虱子 好吧?
- 真的吗?

273
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,010
- Ted 不怕虱子?
- 当然了

274
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,620
好吧 我想你也不介意尝一口
我的琴酒加汤力水了?

275
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,080
没问题

276
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,100
我只用小拇指搅过它

277
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,440
猜猜谁才是爱Robin的人

278
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,370
孩子 孩子热爱Robin

279
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,510
Doug认为我很酷

280
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,390
真的 那太好了!

281
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,770
你和George 都是我牵线搭桥

282
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,540
对 我打算和他分手

283
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,300
什么?

284
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,830
就是...

285
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,410
和孩子的事有点过于认真了

286
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,950
这不是我想寻求的生活

287
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,640
所以现在分手 比他粘得更紧时分手要好

288
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,190
什么?

289
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,310
我讨厌告诉你这个 但是...太晚了

290
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
"我的新妈妈" 今天上课时他画的

291
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,970
哦 见鬼

292
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,010
这幅画不可能是我

293
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,540
那个女人戴着圆环型耳环

294
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,060
我甚至都没有圆环型耳环

295
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,820
我有过一副 是金耳环 那些是水果环

296
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,840
你在抗拒现实 你做的就象
你在感情关系里做的那样

297
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,380
一旦你接近某个男人 你就想退出

298
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,770
好吧 正式说法 他才6岁 
但这观点仍然成立

299
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,970
好吧  我们去问问男人们

300
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,590
他们会告诉你 她不是我

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,860
那绝对是你

302
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,820
你... 你们简直是胡说

303
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,540
嘿 这是谁画的robin?

304
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,340
这不是我

305
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,350
你在开玩笑吧?

306
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,250
这不是我!

307
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,880
我是新妈妈

308
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,580
好像有个漂亮的戒指蕴含其中

309
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,660
嘿 如果你当妈妈的话 你会不会开始
穿裤腰一直到胸部的牛仔裤?

310
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,690
你们真的觉得这是我吗?

311
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,070
宝贝 这就是你啊

312
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,930
如果你想和george分手的话
你也必须要和他的孩子分手

313
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,580
真的吗?

314
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,500
是啊 你不能就这么把他扔在一边

315
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,470
你得亲口和他说

316
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,730
来吧 robin
你也知道这么做才是对的

317
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,320
噢 天哪

318
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,250
Doug说的对: 你真是个难缠的主儿

319
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
今晚我真的很高兴

320
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,690
- 我也是
- 是吗?

321
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,620
嘿 Ted 再怎么生气也没用
我已经先你一步了

322
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,840
从这里出发

323
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,900
我也已经探索过下面的两座大山了

324
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,820
ted?

325
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,380
怎么了?

326
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,650
嘿 doug

327
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,090
你是来见我爸爸的吗?

328
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,510
他正在洗澡

329
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,950
实际上 我是来见你的

330
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,090
我写了首诗 你想听听吗?

331
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,110
当然了 怎么能不听呢?

332
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,190
致我的新妈妈

333
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,010
你很漂亮

334
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,530
你很善良

335
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,230
你的味道就像菊花

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,130
哇 真是太好了

337
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,160
尽管一点都不押韵

338
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,820
听着 嗯 doug

339
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,500
说这些话一直都很难 嗯...

340
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,700
Robin阿姨不知道该说些什么

341
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,380
从来没有人甩过这些孩子

342
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,990
于是她意识到...

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,650
从来没有人甩过这些孩子

344
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,860
她可以用书上的那些酸词了

345
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,860
我们得谈谈了

346
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,350
我只是觉得 我们都需要一些空间

347
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
问题不在你 问题在我

348
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,680
我知道这听起来很难过
但你应该拥有个更好的女人

349
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,040
我现在只是想把重心放到事业上

350
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,710
你明白吗?

351
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,430
我只是希望我们还能继续做朋友

352
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,970
我叫Brooke 我是来和george约会的

353
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,450
你一定就是那个保姆了

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,240
我刚才喝太多咖啡了
我得赶紧去趟洗手间 你好啊 dougie

355
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,150
这是怎么一回事?

356
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,910
那是我的新妈妈

357
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,300
这么说...

358
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,680
这上面画的不是我了?

359
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,560
我为什么要画你?

360
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
她和你爸爸约会过几次?

361
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,290
两次

362
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,800
我差不多和你爸约会过五次了
但你却更喜欢她?

363
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,820
我们之间真的很有感觉

364
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,960
那和我呢?

365
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,270
你觉得我就是为城里的每个
孩子冲麦片的吗?

366
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
你干吗这么生气啊 roberta?

367
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,280
Robin 我叫robin

368
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,120
和小鸟的名字一样 还记得吗?

369
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,630
好吧好吧

370
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,810
这么说结束了 是吧?

371
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,740
- 听着 你人很好 但是...
- 好吧

372
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,820
总会有但是

373
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,980
嗯 我做不到

374
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,260
我和她分手了

375
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,750
顺便说一下 这都要感谢你

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,700
一个漂亮的性感女孩
但我想的却都是你已经捷足先登了

377
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,500
你就像一首瑞格舞曲
一样萦绕在我的脑袋里

378
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,370
哪首瑞格舞曲?

379
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,980
哇 看来事情有了奇妙的转机了

380
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,400
看起来似乎我要获胜了

381
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,970
你怎么能说获胜?
你连和她说话都做不到

382
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,680
上次你去搭讪结果被扇了一巴掌

383
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,290
那是你认为的情况

384
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,760
嗯 好极了
规则一: 不许用眼罩或是别的小道具...

385
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,840
事情是这样: 我朋友刚被人甩了
所以他现在有点腼腆

386
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,310
但他很想请你喝上一杯
然后认识认识你

387
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
但问题是 他觉得像你这样的漂亮女生
是不会看上他那样的人的

388
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,090
所以你能不能扇我一巴掌
让他相信你不喜欢那种油嘴滑舌的人?

389
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,710
你看怎样? 就当是为了我的朋友?

390
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,820
你真是太好了

391
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,660
所以 无论Ted对她表现的多好
在她的印象里

392
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,830
我就是那个比他还要好的人

393
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
那你没和她上过床了?

394
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,010
绝对没有

395
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,010
哇 这招赞

396
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,070
实际上还要更好

397
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,810
还记得Ted和她打的那次电话吗?

398
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,300
好吧 好好享受瑜伽吧

399
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,010
嗯...

400
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,850
- 我...
- 对不起

401
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,600
- Stacey 没记错吧?
- 没错...

402
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,980
- 噢 你是那天酒吧里面Ted的朋友 对吧?
- 是啊

403
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,000
- 等等 别告我说你也在这里练瑜伽
- 我是在这里练啊

404
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,280
她在瑞格乐队里面担任贝斯手

405
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,340
接下来我准备去听场瑞格音乐会

406
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,780
- 我是瑞格音乐的狂热粉丝
- 噢 天哪!

407
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,530
- 我就是瑞格乐队的
- 不会吧

408
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,690
那怎么Ted不早告诉我
我说过了 我是瑞格音乐的狂热粉丝

409
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,840
嗯...

410
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,100
那我进去了

411
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,520
一会儿见 小鳄鱼

412
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,680
- 再见 鳄...
- 在家 鳄...

413
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,560
我们真是心有灵犀

414
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,820
哇 那你保重吧

415
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,480
嗯 你好(印度语)

416
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,310
你真是小人

417
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,940
那可是我的瑜伽垫

418
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,120
现在既然Ted已经出局了

419
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,420
我就要来夺取胜利果实了

420
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,340
为什么?
Parce que j'ai le jeu,mes chiennes

421
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,710
翻译过来是: 因为我才是游戏玩家 贱人们

422
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,930
不 不 这什么也说明不了 因为...

423
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,330
等一下

424
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,020
是stacey

425
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,960
嘿 stace?

426
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,950
怎么了呀?

427
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,430
他不会这样吧!

428
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
待着别动

429
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,990
我马上就过去

430
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,810
我当初就应该戴着那个破眼罩

431
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,280
噢 真不敢相信你被六岁的孩子甩了

432
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,590
管他呢 他是个傻瓜

433
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
我是... 我是再也不想接触小孩了

434
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,280
当然了 robin最后还是喜欢上了小孩子

435
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,320
你们也知道 她在很多人的作品中
都出现过 尤其是你们的作品

436
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,480
我们和ROBIN阿姨

437
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,790
我们和ROBIN阿姨去动物园

438
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,330
我们和ROBIN阿姨去海滩

439
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,190
一个月之后

440
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,510
嘿

441
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,070
知道吗 我真的很感谢你
同意让我们的关系慢慢发展

442
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,000
自从ted之后 你也知道 我...

443
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,450
我实在不想太快的有身体关系

444
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,070
你就是这样特别 宝贝

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,490
不管了 一想到明天就要
演奏"光斑" 我就很激动

446
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,690
我们大概要从11:00演到6:00

447
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,150
所以保险起见你最好9:00前就到场

448
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,590
噢 那里会有不少泥巴的

449
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,670

450
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,730

451
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,990



1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:02,850
It was saturday night in new york city,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,210
and the young metropolitan
set was out on the town,

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,010
living the kind of crazy lifestyle
you can only find in the big apple.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,430
100!

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,740
A hundred? We only got
to 82 on our honeymoon.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,970
So,robin? I've got a guy for you.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,100
He's cute. He's funny.He's smart.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,370
What's his but?

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,080
What do you mean?

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,070
When someone wants to set you up,they
always tell you their good qualities first,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,220
but then they leave out their huge flaw.

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,560
She's totally hot and really fun.

13
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,660
Barney: But she has a dead tooth.

14
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,510
She's super-hot,and
she's so successful.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
But she has a pug that she
pushes around in a stroller.

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,840
She's so cute,and she's so smart.

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,610
But her last boyfriend had to get
a restraining order against her,

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,280
and then his cat and new
vacuum cleaner both went missG.

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,970
Set it up!

20
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,480
I'm still convinced
she killed my turtle.

21
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,080
Hey,you know what? Not
every setup has a but.

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,680
What about,um,jamie,that girl
that lily set you up with?

23
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,600
- Yeah.
- She was really nice.

24
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,870
If memory serves me,she had a huge but.

25
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,130
Her huge butt.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,100
- Nailed it!
- Yeah.

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,700
Well,there'innoths g
wrong with this guy.

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,070
He's really nice,and he's really cute...

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,970
- but?
- Fine.

30
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,660
But he has a kid.

31
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:18,950
There it is!

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
Robin's not going out
with a guy with a kid.

33
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,270
But the guy is really
great,and his kid's sweet.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,170
He's in my class.

35
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,240
It doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.

36
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,920
I don't hate kids.

37
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,170
You told me even when you
were a kid,you hated kids.

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,930
Robin,will you watch cartoons with me?

39
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,900
I go to school all week.

40
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,910
Can't I just have five minutes to myself
to read highlights and drink my juice?

41
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,330
Okay,yes,kids are not my favorite
thing in the world,but I like them.

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,880
Well,you don't want to have them.

43
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:52,260
I like sports cars,but it doesn't mean I
want to push a ferrari through my vagina.

44
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,890
Shotgun.

45
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,980
you can't blame us for thinking
that the kid would be a problem.

46
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,000
I mean,if we were friends with garfield,we
wouldn't set him up on a date with mondays.

47
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,950
nice.

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,730
You know what? The kid is not a problem.

49
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,600
I want to meet this guy.

50
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:07,070
- Okaythat's awesome!
- Yeah.

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,980
Hey,what's my but? You know,I'm A...

52
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,330
I'm really nice,but...

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,220
But she's afraid of commitment.

54
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,750
But she's a gun nut.

55
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,290
But she's canadian.

56
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,240
But she didn't like field of dreams.

57
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,140
- I can't think of...
- you don't have a but.

58
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:28,190

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,190

60
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,090

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,970
Okay. I've got it.

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,870
Here. Put on this eye patch.

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,550
Why?

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,930
The ultimate ice-breaker.

65
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,830
A bunch of cobras got
loose in central park.

66
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,480
You and I are jogging...

67
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:54,610
training for the death
valley iron man no big deal.

68
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,180
We do it every year.

69
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,320
Suddenly,we see these snake bastards
sneaking towards a little baby.

70
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,700
Not on our watch.

71
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:09,920
You grab the kid,I strangle
six cobras with my bare hands.

72
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,230
Women of new york,one at a time,please.

73
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,860
So what are the eye patches for?

74
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,950
We got bit.

75
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,760
- On the eye?
- Yes.

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,700
Both of us ?

77
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,900
They're different eyes.

78
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,070
I don'owt kn see why this bumps you!

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,080
Patch up!

80
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,120
Ted: So robin went on a date with
george,the guy with the kid,and afterwards...

81
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,390
okay,here's the thing.

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,980
George is a great guy.
We had a wonderful date.

83
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,380
But?

84
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,040
Great. I can't wait to meet him.

85
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,300
Can't wait to meet him?

86
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,710
Why did I say that?

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,270
I don't want to meet his kid.

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,500
Well,you knew you'd
meet him sooner or later.

89
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,050
I was just hoping for later,like in 20 years
when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.

90
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,550
Robin,what's the big deal?

91
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,740
He's just a kid. He's not going to bite.

92
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,660
He may bite. We're working on biting.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,160
Why is this kid around anyway?
Shouldn't he be with his mom?

94
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,500
I mean,what kind of lawyer does this guy have
if he has to take care of the kid all the time?

95
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,690
A good one. He won full custody.

96
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,550
He won? He won?

97
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,320
Oh,god,getting the kid
is winning,isn't it?

98
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,210
- Don't tell anyone I said that.
- No.

99
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,370
I'm going out buying eye patches.

100
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,260
What are you doing to help score chicks?

101
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,690
Okay,I'm going to let
you in on a little secret.

102
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,520
People with real game
don't need eye patches.

103
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,440
Theodore.

104
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,100
No,no,no.

105
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:41,030
You can't spell game without
me,and me has the best game.

106
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,320
Yeah,well,I got so much
game,I'm cornish game hen.

107
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,400
Oh,yeah? I'm the new york
state gaming commissioner.

108
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,540
Well,I'm the game.

109
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,420
Well-crafted,keep-you-guessing thriller
starring michael douglas and sean penn.

110
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,630
You're heer and not in stall two.

111
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,140
Yeah. So?

112
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:06,850
I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic
comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.

113
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,140
- Okay,marshall?
- Yes.

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,780
Which one of us has more game?

115
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,700
Neither of you guys has any game,right?
Or else you'd be married like me.

116
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,040
What?

117
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,960
If dating is the game,then
marriage is winning the game.

118
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,140
Yeah. If you're playing
in the women's league.

119
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,720
You're joking. I have mad game,brah.

120
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,230
Okay,one: We agreed not
to ever say brah anymore.

121
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,670
It was a good week,we had
a lot of fun,but it's over.

122
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,920
You've been with lily for 11.Ears y

123
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,940
your idea of good game is
slapping on a dr.Seuss hat

124
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,970
and flashing two tickets
to a spin doctors concert.

125
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,570
Yeah,I hate to say
it,buddy,but,uh,you're kind of irrelevant.

126
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,190
What? I am not irrelevant.

127
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,060
I know tons of stuff.
I can help you guys.

128
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,110
I don't want to be left out.

129
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,230
Ted,you do not have more game than me.

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,510
By sheerbers alone,I win.

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,300
Come on,dude. You've seen my list.

132
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,710
You guys want to hear one of my lines?

133
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,620
First of all,I did not ask to see
that list,and I am still horrified.

134
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,490
And true game is about
quality,not quantity,

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,480
and a quality girl would
pick me over you any day.

136
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,670
Are you a model?

137
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,930
That one's good because it's flattering.

138
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,750
To the girl.

139
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,470
- Ted,I challenge you to a picking up girls olympiad.
- Fine.

140
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,160
There will be 26 events
spread out over 11 weeks.

141
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,260
We will travel to a neutral city where
a panel of international judges...

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,510
or we could just choose a girl,and
the first one to seal e deal wins?

143
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
That's good,too.

144
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,130
How about her?

145
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,540
You're on.

146
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,950
Before we start,why don't we jot
down a few basic ground rules?

147
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,860
Okay,great. No eye
patches or props of any...

148
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,190
One time,I was with this
girl,and I tried that model line,

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,740
and I totally got some over-the-shirt
boob action in the just say no assembly.

150
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,790
Man,just stop. You're
bumming everybody out.

151
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,570
Rule number two-- this bet
is for one million dollars.

152
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,710
- I win.
- How?

153
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,160
Oh,I slept with her. About a year ago.

154
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,310
I just forgot.

155
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,570
Oh,well,that doesn't count.

156
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,610
The bet started the moment we shook.

157
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,150
But I can't sleep with
her again. She hates me.

158
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,080
Interesting. Look who just
took a commanding lead.

159
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,920
Now with you out of the
picture,I can take my swt time.

160
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,870
Ted,she's leaving.

161
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,870
Get out of my way.

162
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,200
By the look of those shoes,here
comes your bathroom buddy.

163
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,420
Look who's got game.

164
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,550
So,you're a big kids person,huh?

165
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,410
Only the biggest ever.

166
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:54,110
I think kids are so
great,especially,um,the little ones.

167
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,000
You know,uh... pudgy,can't
sit up,don't have teeth yet.

168
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,930
- Yoan babies?
- Yeah,I like that kind.

169
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,510
Well,doug's almost six,so...

170
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,190
oh,six is great.

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,610
Oh,you are going to love six.

172
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,050
Six is when they,uh,they
really start to,um...

173
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,060
I hate kids.

174
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,960
Excuse me. What?

175
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,940
I mean,I don't hate kids.

176
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm-I'm just not a kiderson.

177
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,520
I mean,yeah,it's cute that
their shoes are real little,

178
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,650
but beyond that,what's the draw?

179
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,130
- You must think I'm nuts.
- What?No,no,no.

180
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,500
I... so you don't like kids,so what?

181
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,250
And I'm not looking
for a mother for doug.

182
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,770
Uh,why don't we just hold
off on you meeting him?

183
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,290
Yeah. Let's take things slow.

184
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,060
Ted: And kids,that's
exactly what she did.

185
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,050
Then,on a totally different day that
was definitely not the next morning,

186
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,090
aunt robin had to face her worst fear.

187
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,190
Hey,what's up?

188
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,730
It's here,lily.

189
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,920
It's looking at me.

190
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,400
The kid. What do I do?

191
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,510
Just talk to him. You can do this,robin.

192
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,220
Who are you?

193
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,590
Um,I'm robin.

194
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,790
That's a bird's name.

195
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,060
Ah,no,it's not. It's
actually a type of bird.

196
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,710
My friend patrick has a
parakeet named robin,so there.

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,190
Do you want to talk in morse code?

198
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,980
Dude,I'm-I'm just
reading my paper,so...

199
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,570
I'm starving. Will you make me cereal?

200
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,770
Sure.

201
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,900
What are you doing? You're
supposed to pour the milk first.

202
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,020
What? No,you pour the cereal first
so you know how much milk you need.

203
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,690
It tastes better milk first!

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,520
It all tastes the same
once it's in the bowl.

205
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,750
Why are you wearing my dad's pants?

206
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,090
Milk first it is.

207
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,800
What are you reading?

208
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,710
The business section.

209
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,960
The fed's going to lower rates again
to bail out these sub-prime lenders.

210
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,510
Bunch of idiots.

211
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Ms.Aldrin says it's not
nice to call people names.

212
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,480
Well,maybe if they weren't such
idiots,I wouldn't have to call them that.

213
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,170
That's what I said.

214
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,350
You're pretty cool.

215
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,970
You,too.

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,390
Meanwhile,stacey and
i had started dating.

217
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,430
Oh,stacey was the girl from the bar.

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,060
Anyway,I was close to winning the bet
when something unexpected happened.

219
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,050
I started to really like her.

220
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,760
Well,have fun in yoga.

221
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,680
She's stngthening her core.

222
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,540
I think that's going to be good.

223
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,950
Yeah? All right.

224
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,710
After a while,crocodile.

225
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,010
you see this?

226
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,220
Game face.

227
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,600
Whatever,ted.

228
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,530
Get this.

229
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,810
She plays bass in a reggae band.

230
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,960
They're hing a show this friday.

231
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,350
How cool is that?

232
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,870
Oh,does she know that one song?

233
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,760

Mm-mm,chaka,mm-mm,chaka.

234
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,240
What's that song called?

235
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,050
Oh,right. It's called every reggae song.

236
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,050
- I am not irrelevant.
- What?

237
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,450
I ran the numbers.

238
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,480
If lily and I have sex twice a week,which let's
be honest,we all know is being conservative,

239
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,980
and we've been togethe for ten
years,plus 17 more times on the honeymoon,

240
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,210
minus the two-week drought when I said the checker
at the grocery store reminded me of a young lily,

241
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,300
then we have had sex a total
of-- wait for it-- nice.

242
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,890
1,053-1/2 times.

243
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,840
My mom called once.

244
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,360
But that's more times than
barney has ever had sex,

245
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,250
and to your point,ted,lily
is a quality girl.

246
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,880
I win.

247
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,440
Lawyered.

248
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,350
Doesn't count.

249
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,700
- It totally counts.
- You're right.

250
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,700
It does count. It counts as one.

251
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,600
You've had sex once. How was it?

252
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,710
I still matter.

253
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,290
Okay,ted,go win the bet.

254
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,030
You have my bles ng.
Sishe's a wonderful girl.

255
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,500
I should know.

256
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,790
Oh,okay.

257
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,910
Okay,I see what you're doing.

258
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,160
We've never shared a woman,have
we,ted? Isn't that funny?

259
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,100
You're with her now.

260
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,680
I was with her a year ago.

261
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,370
You figure,for her,that's
like 200 showers ago.

262
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,890
You've got to ask
yourself,ted,is 200 enough?

263
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,540
You know what?

264
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,640
I don't mind.

265
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,520
No,of course you don't mind.

266
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,140
Just like the second guy to climb mount everest
didn't mind getting all the way to the top

267
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:16,790
only to find sir edmund hillary's
flagpole thrust into its supple peak.

268
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,190
No,I'm sure when you're with her,I'll
be the furthest thing from your mind.

269
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,780
Kissing what I've already kissed,

270
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,580
nuzzling what I've
already nuzzled,going...

271
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,040
on what I've already gone on.

272
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,810
- Barney,I'm not afraid of catching your cooties,'kay?
- Really?

273
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,010
- Ted's not afraid of cooties?
- No.

274
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,620
Okay,well,then I guess you'd have no
problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.

275
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,080
Fine.

276
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,100
and I only stirred that with my pinky.

277
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,440
Guess who loves robin.

278
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,370
Kids. Kids love robin.

279
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,510
Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.

280
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,390
Really,that's great!

281
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,770
You and george,all thanks to me.

282
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,540
Yeah,I'm going to have
to break up with him.

283
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,300
What?

284
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,830
Well,it's just...

285
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,410
it's getting a little
bittoo serious with the kid.

286
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,950
Just not what I'm looking for.

287
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,640
So better I break it off now
before he gets too attached.

288
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,190
What?

289
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,310
I hate to tell you,but... too late.

290
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,290
{/a6}MY NEW MOMMY He
drew it in class today.

291
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,970
Oh,crap.

292
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,010
there's no way that's a picture of me.

293
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,540
That woman has on hoop earrings.

294
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,060
I don't even own hoop earrings.

295
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,820
I have one pair and they're
gold. Those are fruit loops.

296
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,840
You are so in denial right now and you're
doing what you always do in relationships:

297
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,380
The second you get close
to a guy,you want to bail.

298
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,770
Okay,granted,he's si
but the point stands.

299
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,970
Well,we'll ask the guys.

300
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,590
They'll tell you that's not me.

301
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,860
That's totally you.

302
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,820
Wh... you guys are crazy.

303
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,540
Hey,who drew the picture of robin?

304
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,340
It's not me.

305
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,350
You're joking,right?

306
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,250
It's not me!

307
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,880
My new mommy.

308
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,580
Kind of has a nice ring to it.

309
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,660
Hey,now that you're a mom,are you going to start wearing
those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?

310
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,690
Do you guys really think this is me?

311
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,070
Honey,it's you.

312
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,930
And if you're going to break up with
george,you have to break up with his kid,too.

313
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,580
Really?

314
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,500
Yeah,you can't just abandon him.

315
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,470
You have to talk to him.

316
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,730
Roanscome on,robin,you know
it's the right thing to do.

317
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh,man.

318
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,250
Doug was right: You
are a pain in the ass.

319
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,000
So I had a really nice time tonight.

320
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,690
- Me,too.
- Yeah?

321
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,620
Hey,ted,pucker up all you
want,but I was here first.

322
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,840
From this spot,

323
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:04,900
I also launched an expedition to
those two large ridges down there.

324
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,820
ted?

325
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,380
Something wrong?

326
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,650
Hey,doug.

327
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,090
Are you here to see my dad?

328
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,510
He's taking a shower.

329
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,950
Actually,I came to see you.

330
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,090
I wrote a poem. Do you want to hear it?

331
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,110
Sure. Why not?

332
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,190
To my new mommy.

333
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,010
You are pretty.

334
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,530
You are nice.

335
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,230
And you smell like daisies.

336
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,130
Aw,that is so sweet.

337
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,160
Even though it doesn't rhyme.

338
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,820
Look,uh,doug.

339
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,500
There's no good way to say this,uh...

340
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,700
aunt robin didn't know what to say.

341
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,380
This kid has never been dumped before.

342
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,990
But then she realized...

343
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,650
this kid had never been dumped before.

344
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,860
She could use every clich? in the book.

345
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,860
We need to talk.

346
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:09,350
I just think,um,we both could
use some space right now.

347
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It's not you. It's me.

348
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,680
I know this hurts,but you
deserve someone better.

349
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,040
I'm just really trying to
focus on my career right now.

350
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,710
You know?

351
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,430
I just hope we can still be friends.

352
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,970
I'm brooke. I'm here
for my date with george.

353
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,450
You must be the babysitter.

354
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,240
I had so much coffee earlier. I need
to run to the loo,but hey,dougie.

355
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,150
What the hell was that?

356
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,910
That was my new mom.

357
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,300
So...

358
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,680
this picture is not of me?

359
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,560
Why would I draw a picture of you?

360
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
How many dates has she
been on with your dad?

361
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,290
Two.

362
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,800
I've been on,like,five
and you like her better?

363
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,820
We just really connected.

364
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,960
And what about me?

365
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,270
You think I just go around pouring
cereal for every boy in town?

366
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
Why are you getting so upset,roberta?

367
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,280
Robin. My name is robin.

368
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,120
Like the bird,remember?

369
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:20,630
Whatever.

370
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,810
So that's it,huh?

371
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,740
- Look,you're great,but...
- yeah.

372
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,820
There's always a but.

373
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,980
Well,I couldn't do it.

374
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,260
I broke up with her.

375
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,750
Thanks a lot,by the way.

376
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,700
A beautiful,sexy girl and all I could
think about was you being there first.

377
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:40,500
You were stuck in my head
like a chumbawamba song.

378
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,370
Which chumbawamba song?

379
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,980
Well,what an interesting turn of events.

380
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,400
It looks like I'm going to win.

381
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,970
What do you mean win? You
couldn't even talk to her.

382
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,680
You tried and you got slapped.

383
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,290
That's what you think happened.

384
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,760
Okay,great,rule #1: No eye
patches or props of any...

385
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,840
here's the deal: My friend just
got dumped,so he's a little shy,

386
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,310
but he'd love to buy you a
drink and get to know you.

387
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
The problem is,he thinks a pretty girl
like you won't go for a guy like him.

388
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,090
So would you slap me across the face so he can
see you're not into guys who'd feed you lines?

389
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,710
What do you say? For my friend?

390
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,820
You are so sweet.

391
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,660
So now,whatever nice things
ted does for her,in her mind,

392
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,830
I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.

393
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,040
So you never slept with her?

394
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,010
Not even at all.

395
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,010
Wow,that's good.

396
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,070
It gets better.

397
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,810
Remember ted's phone conversation?

398
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,300
Well,have fun in yoga.

399
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,010
Well...

400
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,850
- I am...
- sorry.

401
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,600
- Stacey,right?
- Yeah...

402
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,980
- oh,you're ted's friend from the bar,right?
- Yeah.

403
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,000
- Wait,don't tell me you go to yoga here,too.
- I do.

404
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,280
She plays bass in a reggae band.

405
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,340
And then I'm going to head
out to a reggae concert.

406
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,780
- I'm a huge fan of reggae.
- Oh,my gosh!

407
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,530
- I play in a reggae band.
- No way.

408
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,690
I wonder why ted didn't tell me about
that. Like I said,I'm a huge reggae fan.

409
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,840
Well...

410
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,100
I should go inside.

411
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,520
After a while,crocodile.

412
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,680
- See you later,allig...
- see you later,allig...

413
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,560
we are two peas.

414
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,820
wow,well,take care.

415
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,480
Um,namaste.

416
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,310
You are a sociopath.

417
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,940
And that was my yoga mat.

418
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,120
so now with ted out of the picture,

419
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,420
I'm going to swoop in
and win the whole thing.

420
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,340
Why? Parce que j'ai le jeu,mes chiennes.

421
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,710
Translation: 'Cause I got game,bitches.

422
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,930
No. No,this doesn't
prove anything because...

423
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,330
hold on a second.

424
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,020
It's stacey.

425
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,960
Hey,stace?

426
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,950
What happened?

427
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,430
He did not!

428
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,280
Stay there.

429
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,990
I'll be right over.

430
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,810
I should've just worn
that stupid eye patch.

431
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,280
Oh,I can't believe you got
dumped by a six-year-old.

432
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,590
Whatever. He's a stupid-head.

433
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,280
I'm just... I'm done with kids.

434
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,280
Of course,robin eventually
made her peace with kids.

435
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:05,320
And as you guys know,she went on to appear
in some very important works of art: Yours.

436
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,480
US AND AUNT ROBIN

437
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,790
US AND AUNT ROBIN AT THE ZOO

438
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,330
US AND AUNT ROBIN AT THE BEACH

439
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,190
one month later

440
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,510
hey.

441
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,070
You know,I really appreciate how cool
you've been about us taking things slow.

442
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,000
since ted,you know,I...

443
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,450
I don't really want to
get physical too fast.

444
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,070
That's what makes you so special,baby.

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,490
Anyway,I am so psyched to be
playing sunsplash tomorrow.

446
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,690
We go on sometime
between 11:00 and 6:00,

447
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,150
so you probably want to get
there before 9:00 just to be safe.

448
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,590
Oh,and it's gonna be muddy.

449
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,670
