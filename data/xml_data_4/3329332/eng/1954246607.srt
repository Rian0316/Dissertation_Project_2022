1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,915
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:05,119
some sort of community,

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,387
then what's the point?

4
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:07,954
Kill each other
and get it all over with.

5
00:00:07,956 --> 00:00:09,857
I'm invested in protecting
the people of this city,

6
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:11,391
and to do that, I need the key.

7
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:12,378
I had Josh lift it for me.

8
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,794
Off my uncle.

9
00:00:13,795 --> 00:00:15,929
My brother taught me
this code 15 years ago.

10
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,364
You're Klaus' father?

11
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,558
- I need you.
- What can I do?

12
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,332
You can bring me back to life.

13
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:24,673
werewolves from the curse.

14
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:25,706
What do I have to do?

15
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:27,206
I need to know what stone it housed.

16
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:30,010
A ring of empowerment, something
to control this curse.

17
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,977
What kind of spell?

18
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:32,279
A spell of my mother's.

19
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,081
All I ask is that
the child is kept safe.

20
00:00:34,082 --> 00:00:37,662
Our daughter should be raised by
her parents in our family home.

21
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,235
us to kill Klaus' child.

22
00:00:40,236 --> 00:00:41,888
Whatever it is you got
coming with the wolves,

23
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,877
just know that I'm gonna
fight for my guys,

24
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,394
I'm gonna fight for my city, and
I will fight until I am dead.

25
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:49,985
I would expect nothing less.

26
00:00:56,903 --> 00:01:00,106
for a bag of rocks.

27
00:01:00,107 --> 00:01:02,474
We'll be in the quarter by dawn.

28
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,077
Sure the hybrid will do his part?

29
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,679
Hayley will make sure of that.

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,481
Yeah. I forgot your fiancée has got
him wrapped around her finger.

31
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:10,445
You know, Ollie, I love
you like a brother,

32
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:14,187
but if you don't lay off Hayley,
we're gonna have a problem.

33
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:15,784
Pay attention, Romeo.

34
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:23,166
All right. Relax.

35
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:25,131
We ain't done anything.

36
00:01:25,132 --> 00:01:26,132

37
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,761
Evening, officers.

38
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:37,305
Step out of the car, both of you.

39
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,680
What's this about?

40
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:44,563
do what the man says...

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,111
Before things take a nasty turn.

00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:01,872

44
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,573
Have I told you that you're awesome?

45
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:12,090
Because you are, along with
the sun, daylight rings...

46
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,846
That guy jogging in the tank top.

47
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,640
Josh, now that you have a ring,

48
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:23,222
I think you need to leave town.

49
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:26,146
Whoa, wait.
We're breaking up?

50
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,661
I'm serious.
Yeah. I know.

51
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:30,029
Serious is kind of
your default setting,

52
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,765
which is why you need me
around to lighten you up.

53
00:02:32,766 --> 00:02:35,200
Ergo, not leaving.

54
00:02:40,606 --> 00:02:42,241
Hey...

55
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:43,246
You ok?

56
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,678
Just witch stuff.

57
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:48,335
Marcel came to me yesterday.

58
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,683
He wanted a cloaking spell.

59
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:53,786
He's gonna make a move
against Klaus, a big move.

60
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,051
Wow. Ok. Guess he forgot to call me.

61
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:59,257
Rude. Well, did you help him?

62
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,759
Yes, because I don't
want him to get killed,

63
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,294
but if Klaus finds out...

64
00:03:02,295 --> 00:03:03,629
Hey, look.

65
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,698
If Marcel has got a plan,
maybe Klaus will buy a clue,

66
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:08,105
realize he's a negative
on the popularity chart,

67
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,469
and go into vampire retirement.

68
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,526
I hear Palm Springs is nice.

69
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:17,656
Klaus isn't the only thing
we need to be afraid of.

70
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,244
Look. If there's a war coming,

71
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:21,493
promise me you'll go before
you get caught up in it.

72
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:29,221
Your mother's spell is as
complicated as it is elegant.

73
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,795
She was clearly a very gifted witch.

74
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,626
Is this the bit here?

75
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:38,009
Hey, like I said, it's complicated.

76
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:41,833
She bound protection magic
to black kyanite stones.

77
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,669
A werewolf with the stones is
free from turning on a full moon.

78
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,101
And what of the improvements?

79
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,979
This spell will enhance
speed, strength, and agility.

80
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:51,643
There should be something
in there about fangs.

81
00:03:51,644 --> 00:03:54,526
It's what my mother used on us
when she turned us into vampires.

82
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,348
Not just fangs.

83
00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:01,658
You said you want venom so the
bite is still lethal to vampires.

84
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:05,412
Hmm. Here.

85
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,038
Should make a nice gift.

86
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:08,960
I'm sure Hayley will be thrilled.

87
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,462
Oh, not just Hayley.

88
00:04:10,463 --> 00:04:12,597
You'll be making quite a few of these.

89
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,700
Let's call it an even hundred.

90
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,802
That's not the deal
I made with Elijah.

91
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:20,427
Well, you're dealing with me now...

92
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:25,765
And I am offering considerably more.

93
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,018
You think because I sleep with you,

94
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,728
I'm suddenly at your beck and call.

95
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,646
Because you sleep with me, luv,

96
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:34,485
I will protect you from those
who might do you harm,

97
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:36,954
including my brother.

98
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,946
Because I need you, however,

99
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:44,896
I'm prepared to offer something
more valuable than my protection.

100
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,165
Which is what?

101
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,957
My mother's grimoire, from
which I took these spells.

102
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:54,211
You see, Elijah is offering
you a mere peek at its pages,

103
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:58,342
but I will grant it to you as a gift

104
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:01,479
if you pledge your loyalty to me,

105
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,849
beginning with the creation
of those rings.

106
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,099
This has been your plan all along.

107
00:05:08,654 --> 00:05:12,089
You want to build a werewolf army,
and you're using me to do it.

108
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,149
Sweetheart, I'm not the enemy.

109
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:18,062
Nor are the wolves.

110
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:20,898
Your abusive coven expects
you to sacrifice yourself

111
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:23,156
for the last of the harvest girls.

112
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:28,161
Do this one favor for me,

113
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:34,084
and you need never fear
anyone ever again.

114
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:47,624

115
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,517

116
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,596
Folks, you need to leave now.

117
00:05:52,597 --> 00:05:54,854
Hey...
Hey, what are you...

118
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:57,899
to be nice about this.

119
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:00,944
Who the hell do you think you are?

120
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,974
I am the new owner
of this gumbo shack.

121
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,741
Ink is not dry on the contract yet,

122
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:07,878
but I can tell you, I got it cheap.

123
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,313
Business is not what is used to be

124
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:11,997
since Sophie Deveraux
kicked the bucket.

125
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,619
Look. I don't want any trouble.

126
00:06:16,621 --> 00:06:19,122
I don't really care what you want.

127
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:20,957
Let's talk about what I want.

128
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,257
Right.
My uncle's key.

129
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,463
You said you were gonna use it to
protect the innocents of the city.

130
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:29,766
Seems pretty ironic,
given your line of work.

131
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:33,810
I'm a legitimate businesswoman who's
never been convicted of a crime,

132
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,825
and, as leader of the human faction,

133
00:06:37,826 --> 00:06:41,478
that key is mine.

134
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,547
I gave you time to mourn.

135
00:06:44,548 --> 00:06:46,281
Now time is up.

136
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,685
Message received.

137
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:53,655
Let me just go find
that key I don't have.

138
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,358
My family has been in New Orleans

139
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:59,996
for a long time, Cami,
even longer than yours,

140
00:06:59,997 --> 00:07:03,500
and we've learned
it's a very hard city

141
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,343
to get by in if you
don't have any friends.

142
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,472
I'd like to be your friend.

143
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,777
So I'm gonna give you until tomorrow,

144
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:17,771
and after that,
I won't be so friendly.

145
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,526

146
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:32,161
Uh! Uh!

147
00:07:32,162 --> 00:07:33,453
Uh! Uh!

148
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,704
Leave him alone!

149
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:37,700
We'll leave your boy alone when
you tell us what Klaus is up to.

150
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,303
How the hell should
I know what he is up to?

151
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,872
See, I know you've been meeting him.

152
00:07:42,873 --> 00:07:46,576
The stones in your duffel bag,
it's black kyanite.

153
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,177
It's pretty rare.

154
00:07:48,178 --> 00:07:50,346
I also know enough about witchcraft

155
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:54,250
to recognize the
ingredients of a spell.

156
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:58,019
So you gonna make me ask again?

157
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,483
Ok.

158
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:10,131
with having two werewolf hostages?

159
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,236
You really only need one.

160
00:08:14,237 --> 00:08:17,339
think you're a bunch of badasses,

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,741
but back in '25, I wiped out

162
00:08:18,742 --> 00:08:20,415
a whole bloodline
of Guerrera werewolves.

163
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,978
They were a lot tougher than you.

164
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,255

165
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:36,558
You let him go, I will
tell you about the stones,

166
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,979
about Klaus...
Whatever.

167
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,106
Gah!

168
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,867
All right. All right.

169
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,969
A deal is a deal,
but since nirvana here

170
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,204
is gonna turn into a wolf
in about 8 hours, D.,

171
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:51,607
drop his ass off way out in the bayou.

172
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:53,950
Will I at least get to kill this fool?

173
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,035

174
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,163
No. I got a better idea.

175
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,987

176
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,322

177
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,590
Yes, brother?
What is it?

178
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,460
It appears our wolves have
gone astray, brother.

179
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,660
They should've been back hours ago.

180
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:13,929
We need to find them.

181
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,230
Well, that might be a bit tricky.

182
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:16,890
You see, we've located their car

183
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,058
on a back road
in the middle of nowhere.

184
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,236
I suspect they've been shanghaied.

185
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,772
And you didn't feel the need
to share this information?

186
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:26,174
It was my intention
to present you with the problem

187
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,318
only after I'd found
an appropriate solution.

188
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:29,811
Well, do enlighten us.

189
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:31,580
I'm closing in on it as we speak.

190
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:34,616
The only person who would be
bold enough to snatch

191
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:37,618
my wolf allies is the one
who has the most to lose.

192
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,622
Marcel.
No. He'll kill them.

193
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,090

194
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:44,659
that Marcel has procured
a cloaking spell.

195
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,378
The only witch who will
aid Marcel is Davina.

196
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,532
I just need to get
one last bit of leverage

197
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,759
before I pay her a visit...

198
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,141
And there it is.

199
00:10:00,307 --> 00:10:01,676
Hello, Joshua.

200
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:03,710
Agh...

201
00:10:13,971 --> 00:10:16,241
Davina...

202
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,187
Uh!

203
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:32,757
Josh?
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,467
What happened?

205
00:10:34,992 --> 00:10:38,295
Joshua went and got
himself a werewolf bite.

206
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,865
Well, a hybrid bite, technically,
but it will kill him just the same.

207
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:43,433
Why are you doing this?

208
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,434
I blame you.

209
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,236
After all my overtures of friendship,

210
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:50,340
you once again sided with Marcel,
forcing me to do horrible things

211
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,777
to someone you care about.

212
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:57,647
I'm not without mercy, Davina.

213
00:10:57,648 --> 00:11:01,077
I can cure him,
but you have to cooperate

214
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,352
and tell me where to find Marcel.

215
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,707
Why, so you can kill him, too?

216
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:09,259
Marcel chose his path.

217
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,262
Seems unfair that Josh
should have to suffer for it.

218
00:11:17,033 --> 00:11:18,535
Davina...

219
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:21,069
He's at a warehouse at the docks...

220
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,807
Thierry's place.

221
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:24,707
You see?

222
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,410
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

223
00:11:27,411 --> 00:11:30,680
What about Josh?

224
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:32,567
Well, he'll live
another 24 hours or so.

225
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:36,070
I may need you, and Joshua
serves as wonderful leverage.

226
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:41,390
The next time I ask a
question, answer quicker.

227
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:46,529

228
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,364
I didn't realize my uncle
even had this place

229
00:11:48,365 --> 00:11:50,032
until a read about it in his will.

230
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,468
This building has been in
my family for decades.

231
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:55,632
You uncle helped us raise the funds
to restore it after Katrina.

232
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,041
I figured he'd kept this
room for extra space.

233
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,137
Anyway, I didn't ask any questions.

234
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:08,683
You know, Father K.,
he was as good as they come.

235
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,688
Sorry for your loss.

236
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,112
Um...

237
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,739
Do you mind if I go in alone?

238
00:13:06,174 --> 00:13:09,377
Here's to buried treasure.

239
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,474
Hello.

240
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,736
Elijah should've called by now.

241
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:24,285
Worrying isn't going to help.

242
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:26,949
You should sit down, try to keep calm.

243
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:32,393
What are you now,
magician-slash-zen life coach?

244
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,562
The treatment of pregnant women

245
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,864
has advanced remarkably
since I was a nurse,

246
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:40,535
but even I know high blood pressure
is bad for you and your baby,

247
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:44,305
especially now that
you're so close to term.

248
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,040
I hate this.

249
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,943
I feel completely useless.

250
00:14:48,944 --> 00:14:52,683
Don't you get it?
You're the point of all this.

251
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:57,985
Klaus and Elijah running all
over town, it's all for you.

252
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,920
I'm a bit envious.

253
00:14:59,921 --> 00:15:01,651
Great. Lucky me.

254
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:04,737
Is there anything I can get you?

255
00:15:05,227 --> 00:15:07,031
How about a moonlight ring?

256
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:11,160
The spell can't be performed until
the full moon reaches its apex,

257
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:16,431
and, of course, I need the stones,
which will be here soon enough.

258
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,210
Have a little faith.

259
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:31,285
Accolades to Marcel.

260
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:34,475
He did quite a dance across
the bridge of your nose.

261
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,855
Where is he now?

262
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:41,561
Nowhere to be found...

263
00:15:43,497 --> 00:15:47,822
Although he did leave us
a delightful parting gift.

264
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,282
What about the stones?

265
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,871
I don't know. Untie me.
I'll help you find them.

266
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:52,952
Sit still.

267
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,538
You'll be freed as soon as it's safe.

268
00:15:58,612 --> 00:16:01,794
Our focus should be the stones.

269
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,483
Considering Jackson is competition

270
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,619
for Hayley's affection,
I think you'd agree.

271
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,020

272
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,455
Over the course
of the last millennium,

273
00:16:08,456 --> 00:16:10,344
his capacity for tact
is somewhat diminished.

274
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,125
Oh, that's typical, isn't it?

275
00:16:12,126 --> 00:16:14,026
Marcel fills a room with dynamite,

276
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,225
and yet I'm the tactless one.

277
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,332
I recognize these explosives
from the attack on the bayou.

278
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:23,024
Could you remind me again why you
believed that Marcel was innocent?

279
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,528
Remind me to ask him before
I pull out his innards.

280
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,645
Ah. Ok.

281
00:16:31,646 --> 00:16:34,243
Exercise extreme caution
in this general area.

282
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:35,548
Bit of a mess.

283
00:16:35,549 --> 00:16:37,784

284
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:40,416
Impeccable timing.

285
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,755
What's going on?

286
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:42,922

287
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,557
He's a little tied up right now.

288
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:46,422
Could we call you back?

289
00:16:49,462 --> 00:16:50,676

290
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,065
Oh, that doesn't bode well.

291
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:53,596
Jackson; Are you trying to kill us?

292
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,567
Elijah, tell me what's going on now.

293
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,541

294
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,409

295
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,626
Thank God you're alive.

296
00:17:17,627 --> 00:17:19,497
Ok.

297
00:17:22,498 --> 00:17:26,501
Thanks for asking.

298
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:28,536
What about the stones?

299
00:17:28,538 --> 00:17:31,472
Scattered across the bed of
the Mississippi, I imagine.

300
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:33,008

301
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:34,376
He knows an empowered werewolf army

302
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:36,878
would mean the end of vampires
in New Orleans.

303
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,048
The explosion is his way of
saying he means to prevent that,

304
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:41,782
for all the good it'll do him.

305
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:43,718
Well, it did him pretty
damn well, didn't it?

306
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,232
I will find a way to fix it.

307
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,924
No, Jack. You're hurt,
and no one is blaming you.

308
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,112
I'm blaming you.

309
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:55,063
Those stones will be hard to replace.

310
00:17:55,064 --> 00:17:58,799
Fortunately, I always have
a backup plan.

311
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:01,903

312
00:18:01,904 --> 00:18:03,104
She's a gangster.

313
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:06,877
I see her more as a means to procuring
rare items at short notice.

314
00:18:07,443 --> 00:18:09,778
Greetings, Ms. Correa.

315
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:11,924
I see you've brought company.

316
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,415
These are my brothers.

317
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,150
I always include them
in delicate business matters.

318
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:19,265
Fellas, meet Mr. Mikaelson.

319
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,523
Please, call me Klaus.

320
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,090
All my friends do.

321
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,729
I don't know if I'd call us friends,

322
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,129
but if you and Marcel are planning
on having a little throwdown,

323
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,945
I'd prefer my family to be on the
same side as the inevitable Victor.

324
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,936
Then you have what I asked for.

325
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:39,174
Not enough for an army at such
short notice, but it's start.

326
00:18:39,175 --> 00:18:43,011
Strange, I wasn't aware that she
was familiar with our plan.

327
00:18:43,012 --> 00:18:45,946
My price for doing business
is full disclosure.

328
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:47,460
Your brother complied.

329
00:18:48,017 --> 00:18:50,752
How does the human faction
expect to benefit from all this?

330
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:54,592
I only want to solidify our
allegiance to the ruling class.

331
00:18:55,157 --> 00:18:56,457
It's good for business.

332
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,472
your capacity for reason.

333
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,129
Sadly, they don't.

334
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,697
Marcel is being especially vindictive.

335
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,633
I'm worried he might come after me

336
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:08,503
or my family just
for meeting with you.

337
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:12,240
It might be in our best interests
if we combine our efforts.

338
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,941
So be it.

339
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:17,677
The more bodies we have to
defend the compound, the better.

340
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,658
Let's get started, shall we?

341
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:26,354
There.
Thank you.

342
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,722
Don't thank me.

343
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,690
It was Elijah who vamped
your ass to safety.

344
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:33,260
Yeah. He really seems
to care about you.

345
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,196
It's complicated.

346
00:19:35,197 --> 00:19:38,385
I think that's the
understatement of the year.

347
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:44,038
Look. I got to go, get back to the
bayou before the moon rises, so...

348
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,477
Jackson, this will be the last time.

349
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:50,523
After tonight, you'll
never have to turn again...

350
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,110
No more pain, no more hiding
in the bayou, I promise.

351
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:59,085
You know, Klaus isn't doing this
out of the kindness of his heart.

352
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:02,523
He's doing it for you, Hayley.

353
00:20:02,524 --> 00:20:05,079
You're the one who's gonna
change everything for us.

354
00:20:09,563 --> 00:20:12,920
Seems I owe you yet again.

355
00:20:20,674 --> 00:20:24,377
I understand he risked
his life to save his friend.

356
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,726
He's a good man.

357
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,851
Yes. He is.

358
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:34,358
Elijah, there is something
that I need to tell you.

359
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:40,761
My family wanted me...

360
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:45,399
I was supposed to be
betrothed to Jackson.

361
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,134
I wanted to tell you sooner.

362
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:49,535
I just didn't know how.
It's this insane custom.

363
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:51,605
No. You don't need
to explain anything.

364
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:55,421
I understand the need to make
sacrifices for one's family.

365
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,245
Oh, come on, Elijah.

366
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:01,510
For once in your immortal life,
can you just not be so noble?

367
00:21:01,676 --> 00:21:02,970
What would you have me do?

368
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,218
I just told you that I'm betrothed

369
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:10,269
according to some backwater arrangement
by people that I never knew.

370
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,992
Tell me that you think
betrothals are stupid.

371
00:21:12,993 --> 00:21:15,608
Tell me that I have a choice.

372
00:21:27,073 --> 00:21:29,538
You will always have a choice.

373
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:35,169

374
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,548
I trust you are ready.

375
00:21:39,714 --> 00:21:42,301
The last ingredient is personal.

376
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,924
As this spell is designed
to control transformation,

377
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:48,261
I need the blood of a werewolf
who doesn't turn on a full moon.

378
00:21:48,262 --> 00:21:50,696
My first thought was Hayley
because of the pregnancy.

379
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,498
Out of the question.

380
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:53,933
I'd just as soon limit the mother

381
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:57,900
of my unborn child to the side
effects of your witchery.

382
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,862
I am half wolf.
I control my form.

383
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:04,323
Use my blood.

384
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:14,291
If you fail to uphold
your end of the deal,

385
00:22:14,788 --> 00:22:19,824
the consequences for you
will be apocalyptic.

386
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:23,928
You say the most romantic things.

387
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:44,530
I appreciate you all coming.
It's been a while.

388
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:47,386
By now, you've heard what's going on.

389
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:51,390
Klaus found a way to make
werewolves lethal to us 24/7.

390
00:22:51,391 --> 00:22:55,499
The fireworks at the docks, that
was me trying to spoil his plan.

391
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,294
He's moving forward, anyway.

392
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:02,067
He's got as witch, he's got a spell,

393
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:07,770
and if he pulls this off, in one
night, we go from hunter to prey.

394
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:11,410
Now, I know what
some of y'all are thinking.

395
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:14,579
"We stood against Klaus before,
and we failed."

396
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,717
Uh-uh. That's on me.
I failed.

397
00:23:18,718 --> 00:23:20,719
I called off the attack
because I thought it was

398
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,188
the only way to save lives,
but make no mistake.

399
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:26,792
If we don't stand against him now,

400
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:30,561
our lives aren't worth a damn, anyway.

401
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:32,130
Yeah.

402
00:23:32,131 --> 00:23:35,767
Wise man said, "if you know
yourself and know your enemy",

403
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:38,876
then you don't need to fear
the outcome of battle."

404
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,797
I know myself, I know my
friends, and I know my enemy.

405
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,967
I know his strengths,
I know his pride,

406
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:51,015
and I know his house,
every nook and cranny.

407
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:53,385
We're gonna go there tonight

408
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:56,101
hard and fast all at once
from every angle.

409
00:23:56,267 --> 00:24:00,272
We kill their witch, destroy her
spell book, and get the hell out...

410
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,159
Yeah!
Yeah!

411
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:05,630
And as for Klaus,
he'll be coming for me,

412
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:07,654
and that's exactly what I want.

413
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,615
I'll lead him away.

414
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,160
I just need the rest of you
to get past Elijah

415
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,996
and do what needs to be done.

416
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,290
So that's the plan.

417
00:24:18,844 --> 00:24:22,379
I need to know right now,
who's with me?

418
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,548
Yeah!
Yeah!

419
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:39,436
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

420
00:24:39,602 --> 00:24:42,129
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

421
00:24:42,131 --> 00:24:44,817
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

422
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,468
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

423
00:24:46,469 --> 00:24:50,772
My people say Marcel is on the
move and he's bringing friends.

424
00:24:50,773 --> 00:24:52,140
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

425
00:24:52,141 --> 00:24:53,842
Get Hayley to safety.

426
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:55,342
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

427
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:57,112
Come with me.
No.

428
00:24:57,113 --> 00:24:59,123
Someone needs to watch her.

429
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,382
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

430
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,127
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

431
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,686
You should help Klaus.

432
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,186
My brothers and their security detail

433
00:25:06,188 --> 00:25:08,549
won't be much against a vampire army.

434
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,125
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

435
00:25:11,127 --> 00:25:12,993
I'll stay with Hayley.

436
00:25:12,995 --> 00:25:14,396
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

437
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:16,797
Go, Elijah...

438
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,017
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

439
00:25:19,183 --> 00:25:20,811
And don't hold back.

440
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:24,505
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

441
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:27,609
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

442
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,028
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

443
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,563
I thought this lot would've
learned their lesson.

444
00:25:48,564 --> 00:25:52,032
Well, they're not exactly
renowned for their genius.

445
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:55,012
So where's the ringleader
of this circus...

446
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:59,183
Too afraid to show his face?

447
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,375

448
00:26:01,376 --> 00:26:06,547
I'm gonna offer you one last
chance to pack your stuff

449
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,149
and get the hell out of my town.

450
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:12,286
men to rush to their deaths again?

451
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:13,554

452
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,282
Every vampire in the quarter came out.

453
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:19,860
They want their city back,
no surrender this time.

454
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:21,955
You're gonna have to kill us all.

455
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,697
Ok.

456
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:26,934
I think I'll start with you.

457
00:26:26,935 --> 00:26:30,404
Fine. Come get me.

458
00:26:30,405 --> 00:26:32,090
If you don't kill him, I will.

459
00:26:32,256 --> 00:26:34,607
He's mine.

460
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:37,763
This won't take long.

461
00:26:38,246 --> 00:26:41,414
Gentlemen...

462
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,584
Shall we?

463
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,395
Raah!
Raah!

464
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:57,449
Not bad,

465
00:26:57,932 --> 00:27:00,536
but not nearly good enough.

466
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:08,040
How pathetic you've become.

467
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:11,745
Explosives, Marcellus, really?

468
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:14,925
I should've know it was you who
detonated those bombs in the bayou.

469
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,761
The docks, that was me.

470
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,953
I got the detonators from Francesca.

471
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,307
Why don't you ask her
about the bayou bombing?

472
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,851
Lies and distractions.

473
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:27,461
I never went after Hayley.

474
00:27:27,462 --> 00:27:30,464
I'm not a monster, Klaus.

475
00:27:30,465 --> 00:27:33,402
I'm not you.

476
00:27:59,459 --> 00:28:03,724
My family has been in New
Orleans for a long time.

477
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:18,155
Take him down now!

478
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,983

479
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,460
Ms. Correa, we need to go.

480
00:28:34,461 --> 00:28:36,496
Your brothers are already
heading out the back.

481
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:37,830
Not yet.

482
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:41,366
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

483
00:28:41,368 --> 00:28:44,302
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

484
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:47,976
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

485
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:50,510
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

486
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:54,858
Matera et lunare tua virtuse.

487
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:03,923
The stones are finished.
I've done my part.

488
00:29:03,924 --> 00:29:05,391
Now it's up to you.

489
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:06,926
I'll get them to the bayou.

490
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,695
Actually, she was talking to me.

491
00:29:09,696 --> 00:29:11,297
What the hell is this?

492
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:13,043
Call it a side deal.

493
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:17,297
Point is, I'm taking the stones.

494
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:18,903
Are you out of your mind?

495
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:21,039
You think that humans
can go up against Klaus?

496
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:24,012
No. I don't, but I'm not human.

497
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:30,394

498
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:41,446
I'm like you, Hayley, and now
I'm gonna take back my town.

499
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:44,563
Like hell, you are.

500
00:29:44,564 --> 00:29:45,564

501
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,645
Don't look so dour, Genevieve.

502
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:01,239
We both got what we wanted.

503
00:30:22,512 --> 00:30:26,658
Marcellus,
how well your name fits you,

504
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:29,453
little warrior,

505
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:32,221
though ultimately one
of no consequence.

506
00:30:39,162 --> 00:30:42,299
My name is Marcel.

507
00:30:45,001 --> 00:30:47,204
Is there no end to your defiance?

508
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:50,340
You summoned Mikael,
turned Rebekah against me,

509
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:55,912
tried to bury me in your garden,
and yet you always fail.

510
00:30:56,981 --> 00:31:01,797
What is there left to do but
put you out of your misery?

511
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:04,362
Raah!

512
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,393
Hayley, I've called 6 times.
Call me back.

513
00:31:10,394 --> 00:31:11,895
You said you wanted
to know if I learned

514
00:31:11,896 --> 00:31:13,329
anything about Francesca Correa.

515
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,916
Her family is descended
from a werewolf bloodline.

516
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:22,756
We've spent two generations
living a lie, and now our time...

517
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,508
Our time has come.

518
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:31,280
You know what do to.

519
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:35,602
Aagh!

520
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,986

521
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:39,287

522
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,280
Ahh! Uh! Uh!

523
00:31:56,973 --> 00:31:59,140
Uh!

524
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:03,679
Yeah.

525
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,590
Agh!

526
00:32:16,092 --> 00:32:17,936
Raah!

527
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:26,235
Are we done?

528
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,772

529
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:31,739
Saved me the trouble

530
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,177
of killing all these vampires myself.

531
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:36,178
Rrgh!
Raah!

532
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,013
Aagh!

533
00:32:38,014 --> 00:32:39,048
Argh! Rrgh!

534
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:40,515
Agh! Aah!

535
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:44,921
Run!

536
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:49,509
Kill as many of them as you can.

537
00:32:51,627 --> 00:32:53,294
Aagh!

538
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:58,534
Aah!

539
00:32:58,535 --> 00:32:59,967
Raah!

540
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:12,848

541
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,150
Aah!

542
00:33:15,151 --> 00:33:17,719
I'm sorry, mate, but
I'm a bit famished.

543
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,248
No. No! Aah!

544
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:24,493
Raagh!

545
00:33:24,494 --> 00:33:26,161
Arr...

546
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:28,897
Oh...

547
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:30,098
Uh...

548
00:33:30,099 --> 00:33:32,400
Ha! You look awful.

549
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:34,679
Why aren't I healing?

550
00:33:34,845 --> 00:33:36,348
What have you done to me?

551
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,207
You were the one that
wanted me to cast the spell.

552
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:44,230
So I made your stones by linking
their power to your blood,

553
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,349
and now each full moon
whenever a werewolf

554
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,050
uses their power to keep from turning,

555
00:33:49,051 --> 00:33:53,053
they will be drawing from your
strength and causing you pain.

556
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:56,242
After all I offered you,
you will betray me?

557
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:03,732
Look me in the eyes, Nik.

558
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:08,880
Were you ever planning to give
me your mother's grimoire?

559
00:34:09,046 --> 00:34:12,926
Did you care about me,
even for a moment?

560
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:18,723
I suppose you'll never know.

561
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:30,318
Francesca kept her end of the deal.

562
00:34:30,484 --> 00:34:33,863
There is, after all,
honor among thieves,

563
00:34:34,029 --> 00:34:38,910
even if they are werewolves, and
as for you, the great irony is,

564
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:42,570
in wanting to take the city,
you've lost everything...

565
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:46,751
Your sister Rebekah,
your adopted son Marcel...

566
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:50,978
And now even your child
and her mother will suffer,

567
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:53,133
all because of your greed.

568
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,615
Raah! Aagh!

569
00:34:55,617 --> 00:34:58,218
I will kill you.

570
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,058
As weak as you are?
Doubtful.

571
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:06,426
Aah!

572
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:16,191
Josh, please drink this.

573
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,797

574
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:22,664

575
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,415
Oh, man.

576
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:29,204
Just hang on, please.

577
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,644
No!

578
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,095
Surely, you're not surprised.

579
00:35:39,261 --> 00:35:43,685
Deep down, you knew Niklaus
would leave Joshua to die.

580
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,852
Why are you still here?

581
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:50,692
I haven't much time left, but
then, neither does your friend.

582
00:35:52,858 --> 00:35:55,612
I can heal him.
I'll find a way.

583
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,741
Even if you could, how long
till it happens again?

584
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,670
As long as Niklaus
remains in New Orleans,

585
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:05,413
you and your loved ones will
continue to suffer his torment.

586
00:36:05,909 --> 00:36:10,668
I am the only man in history who's
been able to drive him off,

587
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,481
to bring him fear and pain.

588
00:36:13,483 --> 00:36:17,550
If your friend needs
Klaus' blood to survive,

589
00:36:17,716 --> 00:36:22,857
I've been known to spill
a fair share of it.

590
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,558
You'll help me save Josh?

591
00:36:25,724 --> 00:36:31,200
I do have personal reasons for
wanting Niklaus to suffer,

592
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:36,236
but, yes, I'd like nothing
more than you help you.

593
00:36:36,773 --> 00:36:39,208
And all I have to do
is raise you from the dead.

594
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:41,324
A small price to pay
to cure your friend

595
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,493
and live a life free of a monster.

596
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,579
Think, Davina.

597
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:50,185
There still exists a weapon
that can kill Klaus.

598
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:55,624
Bring back the one being who
has the strength to use it.

599
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,126

600
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:05,566
Who were you talking to?

601
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,504
Doesn't matter.
I'm gonna fix you.

602
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,747
It's done.

603
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,592
A deal is a deal.

604
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:40,267
You said the bombing was gonna
be minor, no casualties.

605
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:43,052
All I wanted to do was rally the
crescents against the vampires.

606
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,340
And isn't that exactly what happened?

607
00:37:45,341 --> 00:37:48,943
People died...
My people, my pack!

608
00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:50,978
Your pack?

609
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,414
That's funny...

610
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:54,849
Because it looked to me
like they were ready

611
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,444
to follow Hayley,
but now, thanks to me,

612
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:04,325
we have control of the very
thing that will inspire loyalty

613
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:08,195
from both the crescents
and the Guerreras...

614
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:14,125
The means to make our
people even more powerful.

615
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:19,507
The only thing I had to trade
away was the one person

616
00:38:19,508 --> 00:38:22,509
who could've challenged us.

617
00:38:24,843 --> 00:38:27,948
Poor Hayley.
It is a shame.

618
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,976
The witches drive a hard bargain,

619
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:35,255
but every revolution
requires sacrifice.

620
00:38:36,524 --> 00:38:38,993
This city will belong
to the wolves again.

621
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:42,320
All we have to do...

622
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,597
Is take it.

623
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,683

624
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:19,599
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no.

625
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:26,273
No. No. No. No.

626
00:39:26,274 --> 00:39:28,908
No. No, no, no!

627
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,869
Marcel...

628
00:39:32,035 --> 00:39:33,245
Marcel, I'm sorry.

629
00:39:38,218 --> 00:39:42,588
Uh. Uh! Uh! Uh...

630
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:48,929
Oh, my God, Marcel, I've been
trying to find someone, anyone.

631
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,464
What's happening?

632
00:39:50,465 --> 00:39:52,032
You need to get out of here.

633
00:39:52,033 --> 00:39:53,566
My guys have been bitten by wolves.

634
00:39:53,568 --> 00:39:57,037
They'll get sick and then blood-crazy.

635
00:39:57,038 --> 00:40:00,941
We need to find Klaus.
His blood can heal you.

636
00:40:00,942 --> 00:40:03,142
Where is she?

637
00:40:05,745 --> 00:40:07,030
Where's Hayley?

638
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,115
He doesn't have her.
Please.

639
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,701
I know you don't trust him,
but you know I wouldn't lie.

640
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,486
He doesn't have her.

641
00:40:13,487 --> 00:40:16,188
Someone does.

642
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,210
Where's my brother?

643
00:40:21,729 --> 00:40:24,364
I left him in the street.

644
00:40:24,365 --> 00:40:26,432
He was gonna kill me,

645
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:29,835
and then he got jacked up
by some witch's spell.

646
00:40:32,105 --> 00:40:34,340
Genevieve.

647
00:40:34,341 --> 00:40:36,042

648
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:40,013

649
00:40:40,014 --> 00:40:41,414
Get her down on the floor.

650
00:40:41,415 --> 00:40:42,782
We should take her
to the city of the dead.

651
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,567
We won't make it.
The baby is coming now.

652
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,277
No.
It's too soon.

653
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,287
Aah!
Apparently not.

654
00:40:48,288 --> 00:40:50,189
The plan was to induce her
when the sacrifice was ready.

655
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,326
I had to subdue her, and the trauma
caused a placental abruption.

656
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,762
So the baby is coming, and
we'll just have to adapt.

657
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:57,163

658
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,707
You need to be calm, Hayley.

659
00:40:59,873 --> 00:41:01,566
Why are you doing this to me?

660
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:05,471
To be reborn, we must sacrifice.

661
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:07,340
What the hell does that mean,
you psychotic, little bitch?

662
00:41:07,341 --> 00:41:10,843
The ancestors demand an
offering in exchange for power.

663
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,379
And you child will be a fine offering.

664
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,598
No. No.

665
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,185
You will not take my baby.
I will kill all of you.

666
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:22,488
No, you won't, and neither
will Klaus or Elijah.

667
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:23,889
When your baby is born,

668
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,983
we will offer it up to
those who came before us.

669
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:27,276

670
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:31,497
I'm sorry, Hayley, but this
is the way it had to be.

671
00:41:31,498 --> 00:41:35,034
No. No!

672
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,337
No! No!

673
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:40,873
Aah! Arrgh!

674
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,176

675
00:41:49,448 --> 00:41:53,594
Raagh!
