1
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:04,328
这游戏怎么玩
So how does this game work?

2
00:00:02,538 --> 00:00:04,328
{\an8}Xbox360 Kinect运动: 第二季

3
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:05,938
就像手里真的有球那样扔出去吗
I just throw out like a real ball?

4
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:08,058
没错  就放轻松  往本垒投去
Yep. Just nice and easy, right over the plate.

5
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:09,398
好的
All right.

6
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:11,818
你个废物  沃罗威茨
You suck, Wolowitz!

7
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:14,328
你什么意思
What's that about?

8
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:15,288
起哄闹你啊
I'm heckling you.

9
00:00:15,288 --> 00:00:17,298
这是棒球中很有爱的一部分
It's a beloved part of baseball.

10
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:18,928
他说得对
He's right.

11
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:20,398
而且估计你现在还在等着
And given that you're probably still waiting

12
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:22,288
被选进你五年级时那场球赛的队伍
to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade,

13
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,118
我敢肯定你绝对废
I'm sure you do suck.

14
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:27,268
大家好  在干嘛啊
Hi. What's going on?

15
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:28,328
打棒球
Baseball.

16
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,558
我叫你们出去玩  指的可不是这样
Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play.

17
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:33,258
他在练习
He's practicing.

18
00:00:33,258 --> 00:00:34,338
练来干嘛
For what?

19
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:38,098
天使队想找一个宇航员来当开球嘉宾
The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch,

20
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:37,398
{\an8}美国职棒大联盟  洛杉矶安那罕天使队
主场位于加州橘郡的安那罕  也是迪士尼乐园所在地

21
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,898
所以你猜他们找了谁
so guess who they called?

22
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,678
什么  找你吗 
What, you? Really?!

23
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:44,438
其他获邀的人都没空  于是就找我啦
Well, a lot of people who weren't available, but then me!

24
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:48,208
太酷了  恭喜你
That's so cool! Congratulations.

25
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:50,428
你现在算是你们小组里的运动健将了
I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.

26
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:51,938
不只他是好吗
Well, not just him!

27
00:00:51,938 --> 00:00:54,178
我得提醒你一下  你正在跟
May I remind you that you're talking to the

28
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:56,928
找球手  击球手  追球手  与递水员说话好吗
seeker, beater, chaser and water boy

29
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:59,738
我们是第三名格里菲斯公园魁地奇队
of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team.

30
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,008
我知道
I know.

31
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:02,698
看着自己男朋友鸡鸡下夹着一根扫把
Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick

32
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,318
这场面永生难忘好吗
between his legs isn't something you forget.

33
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:07,788
来吧  投一球试试
C'mon now, throw one.

34
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:09,378
好的  来吧
All right, here we go.

35
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:11,888
你看起来像个傻逼
You look like a jackass!

36
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,578
别闹了  你伤到人家的小心肝了
Cut it out! You're hurting my feelings!

37
00:01:14,578 --> 00:01:16,768
现在你知道我们为什么不是在外面玩了
Now you know why we're not outside.

38
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,378
今天的讲课还喜欢吗
Did you enjoy my lecture?

39
00:01:46,378 --> 00:01:48,788
不喜欢  我们的服务员也不喜欢
No, and neither did our waiter.

40
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:52,798
如果他们要卖康沃尔童子鸡
Well, if you're going to serve Cornish game hen,

41
00:01:52,798 --> 00:01:55,378
就应该对康沃尔的历史了然于胸
you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall

42
00:01:55,378 --> 00:01:57,228
否则就得做好准备学习
or be prepared to learn it.

43
00:01:58,148 --> 00:01:59,528
你这话的确很难反驳
It's hard to argue with that.

44
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,418
我懂是因为
And I know

45
00:02:00,418 --> 00:02:02,348
我目睹一个只是撒胡椒的服务员
because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill

46
00:02:02,348 --> 00:02:04,668
数次尝试  但都失败告终
desperately try and fail.

47
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:10,728
晚餐如何
Hey, how was dinner?

48
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:13,098
很棒  我吃了康沃尔童子鸡
Good, I had Cornish game hen.

49
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,328
可怜的服务员啊
Oh, that poor waiter.

50
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:19,598
谢尔顿  我们明天晚上去看个电影如何
Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?

51
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,488
你们要连续两晚出去吗
You guys are going out two nights in a row?

52
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:25,178
我在火车之旅期间错过了数次约会之夜
I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip,

53
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:27,268
所以根据我们的恋爱合约
and I'm contractually obligated to make them up

54
00:02:27,268 --> 00:02:30,038
我有义务把错过的夜晚补上
under the terms of the Relationship Agreement.

55
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:32,228
好热辣的恋情啊
That's so hot.

56
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,138
比热辣还辣  是契约"捆绑"
It's better than hot, it's binding.

57
00:02:38,088 --> 00:02:39,648
如果你们明晚有空
If you're free tomorrow night,

58
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,438
我很乐意邀请你们来双重约会
I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

59
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,668
你知道双重约会不能抵两次约会的吧
You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.

60
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:53,118
那你们爱来不来  我无所谓
Well, then come or don't. I don't care.

61
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:59,428
真不敢相信你腰酸背疼
I can't believe you're sore.

62
00:02:59,618 --> 00:03:03,558
就连职业投手比赛完都需要有人按摩
Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game.

63
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:06,578
但人家投的是真球
But they throw an actual ball.

64
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,128
你是往电视投空气
You were throwing air at a TV.

65
00:03:11,128 --> 00:03:11,768
那我不得不提
For your information,

66
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:14,568
我还跟莱纳德来了一发超赞的击掌
I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.

67
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,308
我有点惊讶你会答应
I'm kind of surprised you agreed to do this

68
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,228
在整个球场的人面前做这事
in front of a stadium full of people.

69
00:03:19,228 --> 00:03:21,798
人家要办个太空日  而太空总署邀请我了
They're doing Space Day and NASA asked me.

70
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:23,578
我不好意思拒绝嘛
I felt like I couldn't say no.

71
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,738
好吧
Okay.

72
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,518
如果你需要  我可以帮忙你训练啊
Well, if you want, I could help you practice.

73
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:28,418
我成长期间打过不少垒球
I played a lot of softball growing up.

74
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,378
谢谢  这会很有帮助
Thank you, that would be great.

75
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,408
很好  那既然要做
Great. And while we're at it,

76
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:32,398
或许我们可以纠正你的跑步姿势
maybe we could butch up your run

77
00:03:32,398 --> 00:03:34,498
好让你跑去投手丘时可以爷们点
for when you head out to the mound.

78
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,888
我的跑步姿势有啥问题
What's wrong with the way I run?

79
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:39,068
我就开个玩笑
Oh, just kidding.

80
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,428
当然没问题
Nothing.

81
00:03:48,788 --> 00:03:51,678
谢尔顿  我有点惊讶你会选去酒吧
Sheldon, I'm surprised you'd choose to go to a pub.

82
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:53,278
在委员会会议时
At our committee meeting,

83
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:55,838
艾米发起了去公园野餐的提议
Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park,

84
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:58,058
我给这提议附加了一堆修正
but I tacked so many amendments on that thing

85
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,168
提议就像铅做的气球一样坠落了
it sank like a lead balloon.

86
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,568
所以我就提议去酒吧
I then suggested a pub.

87
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:04,768
我一开始心中也有诸多疑虑
Yeah, which I was initially skeptical of

88
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:08,178
直到我在网上看到他们有卖约克郡布丁
until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding.

89
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,078
你都不喜欢吃约克郡布丁
You don't even like Yorkshire pudding.

90
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,178
是啊  恶心透了
No, it's yucky,

91
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:13,968
但是教导人们约克郡的历史
but informing people about the history of Yorkshire

92
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,828
那就是赞赞赞了
is yummy, yum-yum.

93
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,518
经过一场唇枪舌战
After a lively debate,

94
00:04:18,518 --> 00:04:21,468
酒吧的提议以2比0的优势通过
that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.

95
00:04:22,858 --> 00:04:24,018
真高兴看见两人这么忙碌
Nice to see a busy couple

96
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:26,348
还能坚持把官僚主义作风贯彻到底
keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.

97
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:30,348
无视他们  艾米  他们是嫉妒
Ignore them, Amy. They're just jealous

98
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:33,658
因为他们的感情永远不会像我们的这么好
because they'll never have a relationship as good as ours.

99
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,988
这时候他是不是要补一句"抖你玩"之类的
Isn't this when he says "bazooka" or something?

100
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,418
我不是在开玩笑
I wasn't making a joke,

101
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:42,258
我只是在陈述事实
I was merely stating fact.

102
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:46,258
我和艾米的感情比你们俩的好
Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours.

103
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:48,478
你不会真的这么认为  对吧
You don't honestly think that, do you?

104
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:50,008
对...莱纳德
Y... Leonard,

105
00:04:50,008 --> 00:04:52,348
我还以为你知道呢
I assumed you knew.

106
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:55,308
从感情质量来看  我们这个圈子的
The ranking of relationships in our circle

107
00:04:55,308 --> 00:04:57,688
排名顺序是  我和艾米
by quality is: me and Amy,

108
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:00,508
霍华德和伯纳黛特  拉杰和他女朋友
Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend,

109
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,698
佩妮和夏敦埃酒  佩妮和你
Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you.

110
00:05:06,068 --> 00:05:07,878
根本不存在什么排名
There isn't any ranking.

111
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:10,748
就算有  我们也不可能垫底啊
And if there were, we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.

112
00:05:10,748 --> 00:05:13,898
就是  而且我喝的是白苏维翁酒
Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc.

113
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,688
所以你只对酒名错了有意见吗
That's the part you have a problem with?

114
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,498
安啦
Relax.

115
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:21,558
瞧  他们又吵起来了
There they go, fighting again.

116
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:25,458
你绝对不会听到她对白苏维翁酒这么说话
You'd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc.

117
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,868
你小时候从未打过棒球吗
So you never played baseball as a kid,

118
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:32,748
连少年棒球联盟都没参加吗
not even Little League?

119
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,778
我本来要去的  但选拔赛那天
Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts

120
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:37,258
我发现了我爸的《花花公子》系列藏书
I found my dad's Playboy collection.

121
00:05:39,288 --> 00:05:40,868
我的手都累坏了
Threw my arm out.

122
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:45,238
职棒大联盟里投手丘的位置
All right, the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball

123
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:47,618
应该是离本垒板60英尺又6英寸[18.4米]
is 60 feet, six inches away from home plate.

124
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:49,728
很好  你拿着这个
Great. You take this

125
00:05:49,728 --> 00:05:52,068
够了就喊停
and say when to stop.

126
00:05:57,998 --> 00:05:59,128
还有多远
How much further?

127
00:05:59,128 --> 00:06:00,518
继续退
Keep going.

128
00:06:03,148 --> 00:06:04,168
现在呢
How about now?

129
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:06,038
好了我会告诉你
I'll let you know.

130
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:09,868
你是喊停了吗
Are you saying "stop"

131
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:12,238
是不是我们太远听不见了
and we're just too far away to hear you?

132
00:06:12,948 --> 00:06:14,658
好了  停
Okay, stop.

133
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,418
你这是在耍我吗
Are you kidding me?!

134
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,018
这距离就是60英尺
That's 60 feet.

135
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,428
60英尺不可能有这么远
There's no way this is 60 feet.

136
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:26,338
老娘看着卷尺的数呢
I'm looking at it.

137
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,468
你要明白现在不是我让你
You realize this isn't one of those times

138
00:06:29,468 --> 00:06:32,978
故意夸大"某物"长度的时候
I want you to exaggerate how long something is.

139
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,948
好吧  我得...
Okay, I got to... I-I just...

140
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,358
我不得不问
I got to ask:

141
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,158
你凭什么认为你们的感情如此美妙
what makes you think that your relationship

142
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,788
而我们俩的却不是呢
is so wonderful and ours isn't?

143
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:48,298
首先
For starters,

144
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:51,008
我们享受在一起的时光
we enjoy spending time together.

145
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:55,838
我们也是
So do we.

146
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:58,078
我见过你们俩无视对方存在
And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours

147
00:06:58,078 --> 00:06:59,938
好几个小时  各忙各的
doing totally different things.

148
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:03,748
这叫"平行游戏"
It's called parallel play.

149
00:06:59,938 --> 00:07:03,748
{\an8}在同一场所玩相同的或者不同的玩具时
相互之间没有互动和交流

150
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:07,058
{\an8}多半发生在3岁前的儿童之间

151
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,508
是啊  三岁小孩都这么玩
Yeah, toddlers do that.

152
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,058
不如我们玩得好
Not as well as we do.

153
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:11,958
那家伙真是有毛病  什么都要赢
You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.

154
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,168
那又怎样  你干嘛这么在乎
So what? Why do you even care?

155
00:07:14,168 --> 00:07:15,738
你听他们的对话
Oh, listen to them.

156
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,608
这还没结婚呢  蜜月就已经结束了
Not even married and the honeymoon's over.

157
00:07:19,718 --> 00:07:21,348
随你怎么说  你连去约会
Whatever. You can't even go on a date

158
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,908
都要三番四次核查你的《恋爱协议》
without checking your relationship agreement.

159
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,428
如果你对基于合同的关系有意见
If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract,

160
00:07:27,428 --> 00:07:30,728
我想告诉你有13个有种的殖民地
I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies

161
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,738
缔结了一份"关系协议"
that entered a "Relationship agreement"

162
00:07:32,738 --> 00:07:35,328
又名美国宪法
called the U.S. Constitution.

163
00:07:35,668 --> 00:07:37,588
但或许这么说不太好
And it may not be cool to say so,

164
00:07:37,588 --> 00:07:40,738
但我认为直至今天  那份感情都还很火热呢
but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.

165
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:45,248
还好我现在没穿着国旗图案的内裤
It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now,

166
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,258
不然它会火热的烧起来
 'cause there's about to be a fire.

167
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,948
其实没那么难
Okay, it's not that hard.

168
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:57,748
你只需看着你要投球的地方
You just look to where you want to throw it,

169
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,368
朝着那方向往前迈一步
step towards where you want to throw,

170
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:00,508
然后把球投出去
and throw it.

171
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:05,018
这就是你的建议吗
That's your help?

172
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:07,948
就好像在说"开飞机的步骤如下:
That's like saying, "Here's how you fly a plane:

173
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,138
首先上飞机
Get in the airplane,

174
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:12,388
知道目的地  然后开飞机"
know where you want to go and fly it."

175
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,678
先投球试试  看看你的实力
Just throw the ball. Let's see what we're working with.

176
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:28,918
加油  霍华德  燃烧你的小宇宙
Come on Howard, fire it in.

177
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,138
快给老娘投球
Throw the damn ball!

178
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:04,954
你们俩打算什么时候结婚
So when do you guys plan on getting married?

179
00:09:04,954 --> 00:09:07,084
还不确定  但我想再等等
Uh, we're not sure. But I want to wait long enough

180
00:09:07,084 --> 00:09:09,614
证明给我妈看  我不是带球结婚
to prove to my mother I'm not pregnant.

181
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:12,994
我可以吃一根你的薯条吗
May I have one of your fries?

182
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:14,124
当然可以
Of course.

183
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:16,544
我可以咬一口你的汉堡吗
Can I have a bite of your burger?

184
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,224
当然不可以
Absolutely not.

185
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,024
真是"完美"的一对
Some perfect couple.

186
00:09:21,024 --> 00:09:22,704
他连食物都不愿意跟她分享
He won't even share his food with her.

187
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,654
汉堡有牛油果
It has avocado on it.

188
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:26,694
而她对牛油果过敏
She's allergic to avocado.

189
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:28,844
你嫉妒我和艾米到
Are you so jealous of our relationship

190
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,894
想她死这么严重吗
you want Amy to die?

191
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:33,924
我才没有嫉妒
I'm not jealous.

192
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,384
我只是觉得你把恋爱
I just think it's silly for you to compare relationships

193
00:09:36,384 --> 00:09:38,814
拿来比较  就跟感情可以量化一样
like they're something that can be quantified.

194
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:40,794
任何事物都可以量化
Everything is quantifiable.

195
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:43,184
这炸薯条  7分
That French fry? A seven.

196
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:45,454
《蜘蛛侠》  9分
Spider-Man? A nine.

197
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:48,844
9这个数  奇怪的是只能得4分
The number nine-- oddly, only a four.

198
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:52,214
-这家伙有多奇怪啊  -百分百
- How ridiculous is he? - A hundred.

199
00:09:55,414 --> 00:09:57,554
谢尔顿  你这只是按自己的喜好
Sheldon, you're just assigning random numbers

200
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,324
给东西乱打分罢了
to things based on your opinion.

201
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:00,604
才不是呢
No, I'm not.

202
00:10:00,604 --> 00:10:02,624
炸薯条有三个变量
French fries have three variables--

203
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,764
松脆度  含盐量  形状
crispiness, saltiness and shape.

204
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:07,354
所以卷卷薯条只能得2分
Which is why a curly fry only gets a two.

205
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:10,904
如果想吃卷卷  我还不如点盘小丑的假发呢
If I wanted curls for dinner, I'd order a clown wig.

206
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,734
恋爱比炸薯条复杂多了
Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry.

207
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,264
贝尔伊德  施奈德和尾本的研究可不是这么说的
Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto.

208
00:10:19,264 --> 00:10:21,854
那三个流氓又说了什么
Oh, what did those rascals do now?

209
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,844
他们编写了恋爱亲密度问卷
They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory,

210
00:10:25,844 --> 00:10:28,554
用行为来预测恋人关系的稳定度
which predicts the stability of a couple based on behavior.

211
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:29,994
不要和炸薯条
Yeah, not to be confused

212
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:31,994
好坏问卷搞混了
with the French Fry Goodness Inventory.

213
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:33,814
那个是我库珀的大作
That's pure Cooper.

214
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:36,364
这问卷准确性高吗
So, this is accurate?

215
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:38,164
已经流行了25年
It's been around for 25 years,

216
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:40,994
也被其他研究者普遍证实有效
and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers.

217
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:43,544
这不会让恋爱有点不浪漫吗
Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships.

218
00:10:43,544 --> 00:10:45,744
有点  是完全不浪漫好吧
Kind of? It does it perfectly.

219
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:49,864
谢尔顿和我得了8.2分
Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.

220
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:52,284
好  我们马上就做
Fine. We'll take it right now.

221
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:54,314
-别做  -怎么了
- No, don't. - What?

222
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,834
-别做就是了  -为什么啊
- Just don't take it. - Why not?

223
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,574
这太傻了  谁在乎得多少分呢
'Cause it's stupid. Who cares what number it is?

224
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:58,724
别这样  挺好玩的
Come on. It'll be fun.

225
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,644
我说了不让你做
I said I don't want you to.

226
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,384
我再去拿杯酒
I'm getting another drink.

227
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:06,524
抱歉
Sorry.

228
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,724
这次就算你两次约会吧
I'm gonna let you count this as two dates.

229
00:11:11,724 --> 00:11:13,484
他们真是好累人啊
They're a lot of work.

230
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:21,004
觉得他有进步吗
Think he's getting any better?

231
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:25,404
有进步
Yup.

232
00:11:26,774 --> 00:11:28,434
就差一点而已
That was a close one!

233
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,764
好的
Okay!

234
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,064
他不能推掉邀请了吗
Is it too late for him to cancel?

235
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:34,654
大概是吧
I think so.

236
00:11:39,734 --> 00:11:41,834
小心啦  球来了
Heads up! Watch out!

237
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:50,984
你生气了吗
Are you mad at me?

238
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:53,314
别傻了  我没生气
No, stop being stupid.

239
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,934
我...松了口气
Um... whew?

240
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:00,884
你是气测试  还是气我们俩
Is this about the test, or is this about us?

241
00:12:00,884 --> 00:12:02,004
我不需要通过测试
Look, I don't need a score on a test

242
00:12:02,004 --> 00:12:04,274
让我担心原本就在担心的事情
to make me worry about something I'm already worried about.

243
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:05,704
你担心什么呢
What are you worried about?

244
00:12:06,494 --> 00:12:08,904
我们订婚了  可我们没什么共同点
That we're engaged and have nothing in common,

245
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,824
这让我很害怕
and it scares me.

246
00:12:12,054 --> 00:12:14,174
我也挺害怕的
Yeah, that scares me, too.

247
00:12:14,174 --> 00:12:15,284
真的吗
It does?

248
00:12:15,284 --> 00:12:16,794
有时候吧
Sometimes.

249
00:12:16,794 --> 00:12:18,904
这可不是好事啊
Well, that's not good!

250
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:23,004
咱俩感情中坚固的基础
You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock

251
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:25,264
就是你盲目地迷恋我
we were building this relationship on!

252
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:29,624
那这么说会不会让你感觉好一点
Okay, well, this might make you feel better.

253
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:33,764
我俩都害怕婚姻会变成一场灾难
Uh, we're both scared that our marriage will be a disaster,

254
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,504
这就是我俩的共同点嘛
and so, that's something that we have in common.

255
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:45,214
而且  我俩都觉得我这人不好笑
Also, we both think I'm not funny.

256
00:12:46,554 --> 00:12:48,684
看吧  你连笑都不笑
Huh? See, you're not laughing.

257
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:55,584
果麦圈客  你好啊
Hey, Froot Loops, what's up?

258
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,564
麦克  你好
Hey, Mike.

259
00:12:57,564 --> 00:12:59,974
航天总局邀请我
Listen, NASA asked me to

260
00:12:59,974 --> 00:13:03,174
为天使队开球
throw out the first pitch at an Angels game.

261
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:04,714
你能给我点建议吗
You got any advice?

262
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:06,884
可以  不要去
Yeah. Don't do it.

263
00:13:08,404 --> 00:13:10,204
你还有什么事
What else you up to?

264
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:12,114
我为什么不能去呢
Why shouldn't I do it?

265
00:13:12,114 --> 00:13:13,334
这事就没好处
There's no upside.

266
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,034
你开了好球  没人会在意
If you do well, no one cares.

267
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:17,314
如果你搞砸了
And if you screw up,

268
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:19,634
你的蠢态将在视频网站上千古流传
you're an idiot on YouTube forever.

269
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:23,664
可这是为了公益啊
But it's for a good cause.

270
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,484
都是为了全场看比赛的孩子们啊
What about all the kids that'll be there?

271
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:26,904
所以我才这么建议你
That's what I'm telling you.

272
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,734
小孩最贱了
Kids are the worst.

273
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:33,424
我亲生女儿上微博宣传我有个大鼻子
My own daughter tweeted I have a giant nose.

274
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:37,634
没准我投了个好球呢
Well, maybe I'll do a good job.

275
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:38,724
这可说不准
I don't know.

276
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:40,684
在太空里你连只笔都丢不过来
In space, you couldn't even toss me a pen,

277
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:42,664
那时候还是零重力呢
and that was in zero gravity.

278
00:13:45,004 --> 00:13:46,644
谢谢你给我打气
Okay, thanks for the pep talk.

279
00:13:46,644 --> 00:13:48,474
不客气  果麦圈客
Anytime, Froot Loops.

280
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:50,574
替我问候你的太太
Give your wife a hug for me.

281
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:51,774
她比你可爱一万倍  
She's so much cuter than you,

282
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:53,574
都不知道你怎么泡到的
I don't know how you ever got her.

283
00:13:56,004 --> 00:13:57,694
他人真好
He's so nice.

284
00:14:02,764 --> 00:14:04,294
不好意思
Hey, sorry about that.

285
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:05,774
不  是我们不好意思
No, we're sorry.

286
00:14:05,774 --> 00:14:08,954
我们一开始就不应该比较感情
We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place.

287
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:11,224
凭什么呀  我们赢了
Why? We won.

288
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:15,224
下次咱跟库萨帕里和他的狗约会吧
You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog.

289
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:17,284
给我们来点有难度的对手
Really give ourselves a challenge.

290
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:19,774
我只想多说一点
I just want to say one more thing about this.

291
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:22,054
佩妮和我是完全不同的人
Just because Penny and I are very different people

292
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:24,444
并不代表我们是差劲的情侣
does not mean that we're a bad couple.

293
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:27,544
一个简单测试便知答案
The answer is one simple test away.

294
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:29,024
就像那次我以为
You know, it's like when I thought

295
00:14:29,024 --> 00:14:31,164
我的衣柜里有负鼠一样
there was a possum in my closet.

296
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:32,764
我只是袖手旁观怀疑吗
Did I sit around wondering?

297
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:36,654
不  我派莱纳德带着尖头棍和袋子一探究竟
No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag.

298
00:14:37,424 --> 00:14:39,844
我杀了他的楚巴卡拖鞋
I killed his Chewbacca slippers.

299
00:14:43,114 --> 00:14:44,234
我们接受测试
Let's just take the test.

300
00:14:44,234 --> 00:14:45,504
不  我不想
No, no, no, I don't want to.

301
00:14:45,504 --> 00:14:47,164
因为你知道我们的分数会很差
Oh, well, 'cause you know we're gonna do bad.

302
00:14:47,164 --> 00:14:48,514
因为这根本不重要
Because it doesn't matter.

303
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:50,994
我不在乎我们得10分还是2分
I don't care if we're a ten or a two.

304
00:14:50,994 --> 00:14:53,784
或1分  1分也是有可能的
Or a one. A one is possible.

305
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:57,114
婚姻令人害怕
Marriage is scary.

306
00:14:57,114 --> 00:14:58,664
你害怕  我害怕
You're scared, I'm scared.

307
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:01,494
但这并没有令我不想结婚
But it doesn't make me not want to do it.

308
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:02,494
而是
It-it just...

309
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,754
令我想牵着你的手  与你一起步入婚姻殿堂
makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you.

310
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,064
莱纳德
Leonard...

311
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,714
如果你说这样的话  我会开心死的
It would make me so happy if you said things like that.

312
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:17,164
我们得了8.2分
We got an eight-point-two.

313
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,834
相信我  你已经开心死了
Trust me, you're happy.

314
00:15:29,244 --> 00:15:31,684
我喜欢他们在中外场设计了瀑布
I love how they put a waterfall at center field.

315
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:34,654
令整个体育场浑然一体
It really ties the whole stadium together.

316
00:15:34,654 --> 00:15:36,844
瞧你  居然在聊体育
Look at you, talking sports.

317
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,244
这真有意思对吗
This is fun, huh?

318
00:15:40,244 --> 00:15:42,154
来看咱们朋友投出开场球
We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch,

319
00:15:42,154 --> 00:15:43,844
吃个热狗  看看比赛
have a hot dog, watch the game.

320
00:15:45,584 --> 00:15:48,444
没人说要看比赛啊
Nobody said anything about watching the game.

321
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:51,864
谢尔顿  那你以为会做什么
Sheldon, what did you expect?

322
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,454
我以为看霍华德投球  
I expected to see Howard throw the baseball,

323
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,944
吃完热狗
finish my hot dog,

324
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,884
麻利地过街去迪士尼乐园
and hightail it across the street to Disneyland

325
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:00,654
正好赶上米奇的音乐大游行
just in time for Mickey's Soundsational Parade.

326
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:03,094
这样吧
I'll tell you what.

327
00:16:03,094 --> 00:16:06,354
如果我们留下来  我就给你买棉花糖和摇头娃娃
If we stay, I'll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead.

328
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,414
谁的摇头娃娃
Who's the bobblehead of?

329
00:16:09,414 --> 00:16:11,054
有区别吗
Does it matter?

330
00:16:11,494 --> 00:16:13,564
没有  只要摇头就行
No, as long as it bobbles.

331
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,014
华仔  我真为你骄傲
Howie, I am so proud of you.

332

他真会投球吗

-咱们魁地球队中他...  -那就是不行
- On our Quidditch team, he... - Yeah, that's a "No."

346
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:55,644
我要对今天在座的年轻人说几句
I have a message for the young people here today.

347
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:58,994
当我被邀请来开球时
When I was asked to throw the first pitch,

348
00:16:59,224 --> 00:17:04,394
我脑袋里有个小声音说  "你不行"
a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it.

349
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:07,524
所以我反复练习
So, I practiced and practiced,

350
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:09,084
你们猜怎样
and you know what?

351
00:17:09,454 --> 00:17:11,064
那个小声音
That little voice...

352
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:13,894
是正确的  但是
...was right, but...

353
00:17:15,794 --> 00:17:19,814
我想起我不是运动员
...then I remembered that I'm not an athlete.

354
00:17:19,814 --> 00:17:22,044
我是科学家
I'm a scientist.

355
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:24,264
所以今天的第一球
So, today's first pitch

356
00:17:24,264 --> 00:17:28,294

投吧

362
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,094
为什么这么慢
Why is it going so slow?!

363
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,934
因为我是白痴  没考虑周全
'Cause I'm an idiot who didn't think this through!

364
00:18:01,094 --> 00:18:03,934
{\an8}火星车的最高速度为50毫米/秒  平均速度10毫米/秒

365

You suck, Wolowitz!

372
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,314
他说得太对了
He makes a valid point!

373
00:18:52,368 --> 00:18:55,398
