1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,673
Barney is just a look. 

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:07,525
Three blonde drinking drinks 
of bad decisions to 8:00. 

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:11,624
Nice catch, radar. 
This is my wife. 

4
00:00:11,842 --> 00:00:13,254
No, I will dispense. 

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,058
Really? But blondes are 
and are drunk. 

6
00:00:16,093 --> 00:00:17,342
Not your type? 

7
00:00:17,377 --> 00:00:20,174
Maybe I do not 
has a type, Lily. 

8
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:25,070
Wow, you think the mind 
men are simple is that? 

9
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:27,820
We have a 
preferred type? 

10
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:30,535
Credo ... 
Asian, with booby. 

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,299
I go to the bathroom and I have. 

12
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:36,792
Barney has noted how 
acted weird lately? 

13
00:00:36,827 --> 00:00:37,965
I noticed it. 

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,122
Remember as Barney always says 
not buying flowers for women 

15
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:42,244
why make things 
remember the babies? 

16
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,481
- Yeah. 
- Well, these days 

17
00:00:44,516 --> 00:00:47,135
I saw the flowers 
buying roses. 

18
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,719
- What? 
- Now that touched on the subject, 

19
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:52,764
Barney was the one thing 
strange at work yesterday. 

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,326
Okay, until Saturday. 

21
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:57,487
I'm planning a brunch, go to 
market and to an escalation. 

22
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,348
I love you too. 
Bye. 

23
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,077
I thought he was 
just chatting 

24
00:01:03,112 --> 00:01:05,098
with some girl who 
were trying to take. 

25
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:08,948
Or with Ted, maybe. 
But now, you will know. 

26
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:12,764
Does Barney Stinson 
has a girlfriend? 

27
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:15,902
- That I will. 
- Wait Barney. 

28
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:17,702
- Where are you going? 
- The anywhere. 

29
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:21,369
To the beach. It is winter. 
Play laser sight. Home. 

30
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:23,951
Shut up, you 
is going somewhere. 

31
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:27,958
My God, he will 
meet with her. 

32
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,128
To where Barney is going? 

33
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:35,474
We are not 
More in Manhattan. 

34
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,882
Where this girl lives? 

35
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:40,383
We are talking about a girl who 
managed to tie Barney Stinson. 

36
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,344
Must be in Narnia. 

37
00:01:43,266 --> 00:01:44,534
He is stopping. 

38
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:59,058
- What are you doing here? 
- Where is she? 

39
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:00,917
- Who? 
- Your girlfriend. 

40
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:03,147
Hello! 

41
00:02:03,182 --> 00:02:06,372
You do not have a 
same type, huh? 

42
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,941
These are my friends. 

43
00:02:08,976 --> 00:02:11,832
Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin. 

44
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,688
People, this is Laurette. 

45
00:02:14,723 --> 00:02:15,692
My mother. 

46
00:02:15,727 --> 00:02:17,663
It is a pleasure to meet them. 

47
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,714
I feel like now 
you all know. 

48
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:22,885
Barney talks about you all 
the days that talk. 

49
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,596
You connect all 
days for his mother? 

50
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:27,813
No, mother! 

51
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,514
So this is your 
big secret? 

52
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,007
Not that I know 
which is the little boy's mom? 

53
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:38,221
Yeah, I got. 
I think I can go. 

54
00:02:38,256 --> 00:02:41,418
- Hello! 
- Oi. 

55
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,619
Barney, who are 
these people? 

56
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:47,750
Ted, Marshall, Lily and Robin. 

57
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,939
I would submit them 
Betty, my wife. 

58
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,625
And my son, Tyler. 

59
00:02:56,633 --> 00:03:00,730
- - = How I Met Your Mother - = - -- 
- - = S04E15 - The Stinsons = - -- 

60
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,545
Translation 
koe and Joker 

61
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:05,445
 

62
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,889
 

63
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:09,625


65
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:20,951
This reminds me that you can not 
steak, after which the doctor said 

66
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,175
on cholesterol. 

67
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,783
This woman wants 
I live forever. 

68
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:25,358
Guilty! 

69
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:27,273
- I love you. 
- I love you too. 

70
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,234
- I love you more! 
- Get out, pestinha! 

71
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:36,024
- So, I see you at the bar? 
- Barney, what the hell is that? 

72
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:38,419
All right, is a 
long history. 

73
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:40,744
As I know, 
my father had to 

74
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:42,821
leave my mother 
when I was a child 

75
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,992
for presenter 
of "The Price is Right!" 

76
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,729
- Oh, yeah! 
- Absolutely. 

77
00:03:46,764 --> 00:03:47,738
He is your father! 

78
00:03:47,773 --> 00:03:52,272
She had to create my 
brother and me alone. 

79
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:53,648
And the only dream she had, 

80
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:56,802
was that their children 
ended not alone 

81
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,301
as she was. 

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,903
So seven years ago, 
she was very sick. 

83
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,547
It seemed not 
could escape. 

84
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:08,274
Therefore decided 
realize the dream of her. 

85
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:11,931
Mom, this is Betty. 
We are engaged. 

86
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:16,306
I hired an actress to 
interpret my girlfriend Betty. 

87
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,077
The real name 
it is Margaret. 

88
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:19,885
It shows in the theater of 
Broadway one time or another. 

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,934
Wonderful actress. Was 
so to win a Tony. 

90
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:24,208
But as you know, there is much bureaucracy, 
then will not go into it. 

91
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,615
But has a problem. 

92
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:29,980
Betty has a small 
tendency to flee from the roadmap. 

93
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:33,151
See, Mom? I found 
someone who makes me happy. 

94
00:04:33,186 --> 00:04:36,253
- Just like you wanted. 
- This is wonderful. 

95
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:40,921
I live just one more 
just to take my grandchildren. 

96
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,788
I'm pregnant! 

97
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,789
Then my mother improved. 

98
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:52,195
It was a miracle, 
but meant that 

99
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,531
I have to keep 
Betty around, 

100
00:04:54,566 --> 00:04:56,985
and a child to climb 
interpret my son, Tyler. 

101
00:04:57,155 --> 00:04:58,753
This is crazy. 

102
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:01,098
Did you even test 
to choose your child? 

103
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,944
For a while I was the nanny 
the children of my neighbors. 

104
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,830
In one Christmas when my mother 
was drunk with Eggnog, 

105
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,681
I cheated with a bag of 
flowers and a mask of Chuck. 

106
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,751
But there came a day that I had 
to do tests on cast. 

107
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:22,401
4, 8, and 13 can stay. 
The rest is not required. 

108
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:27,523
He said that if I sleep with you, 
my son would take the role. 

109
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:30,481
It seems that I am better 
actor than his son. 

110
00:05:30,516 --> 00:05:32,346
Bring them to 11hs. 

111
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:38,401
So that the role 
Tyler went to the Grant. 

112
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,422
What is the Grant me 
looks good actor. 

113
00:05:41,457 --> 00:05:46,136
Really? 
Look at this. 

114
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:50,816
Hey Tyler! Tyler! 
Tyler! 

115
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:55,076
- Grant. 
- You? 

116
00:05:55,234 --> 00:05:58,594
See? It is an amateur sitting there. 
You can call me crazy, 

117
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,954
but the actors were children 
much better in the 80s. 

118
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,827
Barney, it seems that their 
Mom kept the room 

119
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:09,889
of his childhood in the same 
the way they left. 

120
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:13,024
Yes, and by the way, 
beautiful poster of Karate Kid. 

121
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:14,748
Karate Kid is a great movie. 

122
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,589
It is the story of a young man 
the karate wonder, whose dream 

123
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:22,361
led him across the road 
to Karate Championship. 

124
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:26,051
Of course, unfortunately, it loses 
in the final round for that nerd. 

125
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,923
But he learns the beautiful 
lesson to accept defeat. 

126
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,615
Wait, when you 
watch Karate Kid, 

127
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,484
fan for that 
blonde boring? 

128
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,993
No, I hope for that 
loser of New Jersey 

129
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,950
you hardly know what karate. 

130
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,198
When I watch Karate Kid I 
hope for the real karate kid. 

131
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:51,064
Johnny Lawrence. 
Connects, Lily. 

132
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,578
I just find 
where you know. 

133
00:06:56,965 --> 00:07:03,208
I saw you showing 
Misdirection in the theater, 

134
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:07,077
last fall. 
You were a revelation. 

135
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:09,474
- Really? 
- Absolutely. 

136
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,039
Thank you, not 
was sure. 

137
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:16,298
The objective of Braxford, 
is alienating the public, of course. 

138
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,483
Sorry, here is a fan of him. 

139
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:22,834
You know even the 
theater that attends. 

140
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:26,788
The Miss. Theater grabbed my 
heart and never released. 

141
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:32,064
Every year I put up a piece 
for parents with other children. 

142
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:35,742
Wow, Santa, think 
we can leave this snow? 

143
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,496
Cut, cut and cut! 

144
00:07:38,531 --> 00:07:41,142
Ricky, Grandma and Grandpa 
come here in half an hour 

145
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,170
and is still using 
my words. 

146
00:07:43,205 --> 00:07:46,382
Looks like I will have to 
manage and operate this thing. 

147
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:48,317
Give me the hat and go sit down. 

148
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,408
I always wanted to be 
actor, secretly. 

149
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:54,428
One of those dreams that 
flee from the hands, I think. 

150
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,414
If you like, you can give 
some tips of performance. 

151
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,087
- Really? 
- I love. 

152
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,608
Okay. 
Rule of Practice 1. 

153
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:03,656
Do not be afraid of ... 

154
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,265
At least someone is 
encouraged to act. 

155
00:08:07,117 --> 00:08:08,279
I miss it. 

156
00:08:08,314 --> 00:08:10,506
So you do not like 
interpret the son of Barney? 

157
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,005
I hate. But the 
What can I do? 

158
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,186
- I find another role. 
- I know what you mean. 

159
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,588
I am a news presenter. 

160
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:18,921
But I had to 
accept a job 

161
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,560
the presenter of 
a morning program 

162
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,746
which goes to air at 4:30 in the morning. 

163
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,693
I should be very well 
applicable to that time, you know? 

164
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:28,416
I am almost 30 years. 

165
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,806
Ah, speaking seriously. You 
is still very beautiful. 

166
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,792
I love the plastic 
that made the nose. 

167
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:35,571
Never did the plastic nose. 

168
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:38,650
Yeah, me neither. 

169
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,235
I do not believe that not 
before we know it. 

170
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,722
I wish that Barney 
had a mother so sweet. 

171
00:08:45,757 --> 00:08:47,186
Thank you, honey. 

172
00:08:47,221 --> 00:08:50,716
The truth is I never went 
the best mother when he was young. 

173
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:54,069
Do not say that I have 
sure was great. 

174
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,185
No, I was half bitch. 

175
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,363
- Excuse me? 
- Bitch, baby. 

176
00:08:59,398 --> 00:09:01,530
A dirty whore. 

177
00:09:01,565 --> 00:09:03,602
I am not proud of it. 

178
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,906
Although I had my fun. 

179
00:09:08,454 --> 00:09:13,529
There is no greater pleasure than looking 
in the eyes of a man thinking 

180
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,196
"I do not know your name, 
or you know my, " 

181
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:23,213
but in the next 8 minutes 
we will put you break. 

182
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:27,748
Then go 
in opposite directions. 

183
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,066
Continue driving. 

184
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:37,141
Mother of Barney? 
Laurette? 

185
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,833
Anyway, this is everything 
in the past now. 

186
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:46,383
I did the best I could, 
but sometimes I wonder 

187
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:48,920
Barney is as 
came out so perfect. 

188
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:52,248
You must tell the truth 
to your mother, understand? 

189
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,775
She is a sweet woman, 
sweet, caring, 

190
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:57,764
way too detailed, 
you deserve something better. 

191
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,933
No, no way. 
The fact kill her. 

192
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:05,426
I do not think lying to a 
a lady so loving. 

193
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,160
She reminds me 
my own mother. 

194
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:09,285
Okay ... 

195
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:11,866
- What? 
- Baby? 

196
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:15,898
Remember our votes when I 
said that we would be forever? 

197
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:21,633
On the way back, she said, 
not forever, baby. 

198
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:23,798
The Marshall goes to heaven. 

199
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,892
- She was making a joke. 
- She hates me, Marshall. 

200
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:30,012
But okay, because ... 
Whatever. 

201
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:33,176
What? What say? 

202
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,654
Nothing, do what you want 
in the room of Barney's New? 

203
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:40,002
- In my carpet? 
- The feeling is great, man. 

204
00:10:40,037 --> 00:10:43,651
Hey Lily, is now 
learned something, 

205
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,151
is that sincerity is important 
when it comes to family. 

206
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:50,046
Whatever it is you 
feel for my mother, 

207
00:10:51,006 --> 00:10:56,008
are together for 12 years, 
I think I can handle. 

208
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,022
- Really? 
- Sure. 

209
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,520
Okay. I hate his mother. 

210
00:11:02,716 --> 00:11:04,363
Guess what? 

211
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,241
I hate you! 

212
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:11,255
Two minutes for the cookies 
get ready meat! 

213
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,455
Meat cake? 
Tyler does not like! 

214
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,395
Grant, we talked about 
that millions of times. 

215
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,717
You can not 
have a stick. 

216
00:11:21,752 --> 00:11:23,524
But it is funny. 

217
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,718
Grant, not afraid 
to climb another actor. 

218
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:29,877
Go decorate their speeches 
to the scene of the dinner. 

219
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,055
Wait. You wrote 
we have dinner? 

220
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,619
Just a short script. 

221
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,856
Things will 
my mother happy. 

222
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,206
For example? 

223
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,289
And I really thought 

224
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:43,695
Barney had forgotten that 
our anniversary. 

225
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,758
So I went to the backyard 
spitting fire ... 

226
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:51,097
Huge flames, when she 
is angry, which I love. 

227
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:54,200
See them there. 
Look them up! 

228
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,228
You can stop, good guy. 

229
00:11:56,263 --> 00:11:59,296
Sure. Sorry. 
Continue. 

230
00:11:59,331 --> 00:12:02,057
What is really 
a good relationship. 

231
00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,170
So I left 
to the yard ... 

232
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:09,816
and had candles around corner. 
And a string quartet. 

233
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:14,072
- Believe that? 
- Not a bit. 

234
00:12:14,107 --> 00:12:17,262
And my little Ty-ty, 
you have done? 

235
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:18,691
Funny story. 

236
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:22,104
Another night, that silly 
had a nightmare. 

237
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,894
And when he was telling us about 
which was, remember what I said? 

238
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:32,053
Page four. 

239
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,094
Bones of dinosaur won 
life and came chasing me? 

240
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,098
Thanks, man, I do not 
needed to sleep today. 

241
00:12:42,133 --> 00:12:46,073
No. Tyler said: 
"My nightmare was 

242
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:50,020
you and Mom did not 
knew how much I loved those. 

243
00:12:50,055 --> 00:12:53,933
So I came here to say 
it was this big. " 

244
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:57,289
- How cute! 
- How happy family and baby. 

245
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:00,611
I'll get ice cream 
downstairs in the fridge 

246
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,126
and comeremos sundae 
in the kitchen. 

247
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:08,732
Wow, 
no error in that scene. 

248
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,635
- Bravo! 
- No fills, Barney. 

249
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,827
You do not know how 
hard work for you. 

250
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,682
Grant, I love your story 
on the bones of dinosaur. 

251
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,717
Can you stop 
to talk about it? 

252
00:13:23,253 --> 00:13:26,721
- Go eat your sundae. 
- I can not. 

253
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:29,791
I am intolerant to lactose. 

254
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:32,791
Guess who is not? 
Tyler! 

255
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:37,786
Tyler is in there 
and enjoy each bite. 

256
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:40,941
- Time of the ice cream! 
- Yummy! 

257
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:44,937
My God! 

258
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,920
- Ted! 
- Tyler does not like. 

259
00:13:47,955 --> 00:13:50,868
You will not 
have a stick. 

260
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,492
- I understand. 
- I understand. 

261
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:05,161
I follow. 
I. .. 

262
00:14:05,196 --> 00:14:09,123
I was betrayed by 
my best friend. 

263
00:14:09,158 --> 00:14:11,602
How could you do that, Ted? 

264
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:14,011
Think of the poor 
of Tyler ... 

265
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:17,032
trying bravely 
hold the tears. 

266
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:20,429
All right, son. 
You can cry. 

267
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:23,035
Weep. 

268
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,121
I do not want Mom 
and Dad divorced. 

269
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:35,943
What has to say 
in his defense? 

270
00:14:37,032 --> 00:14:39,221
1 rule of action. 

271
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:40,957
Do not be afraid 
to improvise. 

272
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:45,378
It was I who betrayed you ... 

273
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:48,324
and you betrayed me? 

274
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,740
How? 

275
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:52,667
Rule of action 5. 

276
00:14:52,702 --> 00:14:55,740
Make a good story 
for your character. 

277
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:59,314
14 November 1998. 

278
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,483
The night train 
to Monte Carlo. 

279
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:05,601
I was in the car, 

280
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:09,020
taking a few thousand 
of the Algerian dinar. 

281
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,303
When you seduced 
my bride, 

282
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:17,026
who is blind and found 
you were me. 

283
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:18,510
Good! 

284
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,142
What are you talking about? 

285
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:23,615
Rule of action 
number eight: 

286
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,395
Do not be afraid 
to be aggressive. 

287
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,773
You know very well 
what I'm talking about. 

288
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:31,135
No, I do not know. 

289
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:33,103
You know, yes! 

290
00:15:33,138 --> 00:15:35,417
And, by God, 
hear you say: 

291
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,002
Mom, can you excuse us? 

292
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:41,669
Sure. 

293
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:44,988
Have chocolate 
and butterscotch. 

294
00:15:45,023 --> 00:15:48,392
Has several types of 
sprinkler and marshmallows. 

295
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,638
You lost your mind? 

296
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:55,179
You were great! 

297
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:57,927
Almost become 
in character. 

298
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,135
Not trying 
interpret the Ted, 

299
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,621
but leaving 
the way of it. 

300
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:04,628
What with? 

301
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,281
As I will explain 
this to my mother? 

302
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,319
Perhaps it is time to count 
the truth, Barney. 

303
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:12,506
I do not know, no. 
Sometimes, honesty 

304
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,623
leads people 
to say bad things 

305
00:16:14,658 --> 00:16:17,398
about a woman who 
always cared about me. 

306
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,822
Because I was 
the dwarf family. 

307
00:16:19,857 --> 00:16:22,834
For the love of God, 
I only have 1.93. 

308
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:28,486
- I said well you? 
- He very well. 

309
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,448
See? Even in a 
job you hate, 

310
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:33,275
you still like 
of what it does. 

311
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,312
Maybe so for you 
in his new job. 

312
00:16:36,347 --> 00:16:39,194
- You think? 
- I'm sure. 

313
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,879
Thanks, Grant. 

314
00:16:40,914 --> 00:16:43,622
You are very intelligent, 
you know? 

315
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:51,663
Sorry, sorry. 
I thought I was rolling a climate. 

316
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:56,723
- Honey, you okay? 
- Look, Mom ... 

317
00:16:56,758 --> 00:16:58,928
must tell you something. 

318
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:02,245
Something I should have 
counted for a long time. 

319
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,854
Tyler is dying. 

320
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:11,815
And Betty said that 
when it is, 

321
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,445
it will depart. 

322
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,099
And that everything must 
happen soon. 

323
00:17:16,134 --> 00:17:19,336
- My God! 
- Okay, no, no. 

324
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,768
None of this is true. 

325
00:17:21,803 --> 00:17:24,165
The truth is ... 

326
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:29,947
The truth is that 
Tyler and Betty are actors, 

327
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,047
I hired to 
pretend to be my family. 

328
00:17:33,082 --> 00:17:34,510
What? 

329
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:38,393
I thought that I 
had the life you want. 

330
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:41,255
I wanted it 
proud of me. 

331
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,371
I know that sounds crazy, 
and sorry for everything. 

332
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:48,237
- So, Betty is not your wife? 
- No. 

333
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:50,365
Thank God! 

334
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,140
I do not like that woman. 

335
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:55,455
- Really? 
- Yes 

336
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:57,985
And Tyler ... 

337
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,567
I know that his grandmother 
and should love him, 

338
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:04,686
but hate that kid. 
"Tyler does not like." 

339
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:06,461
- What is this drug? 
- Not? 

340
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:10,925
And those false friends 
give me will die. 

341
00:18:11,593 --> 00:18:14,399
I know! 
They are not horrible? 

342
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:17,205
So, seriously, 
is not mad? 

343
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,874
No, I'm just confused. 

344
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,214
Why think 
you should do that? 

345
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:24,513
Barney, I love him with 
or no perfect family. 

346
00:18:24,548 --> 00:18:26,923
I love you, no matter 
what happens. 

347
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,288
- Really? 
- Really. 

348
00:18:34,475 --> 00:18:37,108
I am so relieved! 

349
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:40,695
Because the truth is that I am 
as far away from marriage 

350
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,824
possible. My history with 
women to leave shocked. 

351
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,805
No matter. 
Still love him. 

352
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,619
Seriously, can not imagine 
things I did. 

353
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:53,487
When you had three years, 
I left with the babysitter 

354
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:58,340
I spent 3 weeks with 
round like a ball. 

355
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,490
Mom! 

356
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,573
Just do me a favor. 

357
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:04,742
If you know 
someone special, 

358
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,353
not go as I did. 

359
00:19:07,388 --> 00:19:09,807
Take a chance. 

360
00:19:09,842 --> 00:19:12,414
Barney, the taxi arrived. 

361
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,762
I will try. 

362
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,781
<i> And so ended one of the evenings 
more alien to our lives. </ i> 

363
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:27,809
I just wanted to say that 
if some day seem cold 

364
00:19:27,844 --> 00:19:30,882
or hostile, 
sorry. 

365
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,773
- Who is she talking about? 
- With my mother. 

366
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:37,980
Mean much to me 
if we could be closer. 

367
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:42,153
Take a deep breath, as if that 
will say now is difficult. 

368
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:48,428
- I love you. 
- I love you ... 

369
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:50,749
- Mother 
- Yes! 

370
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:52,268
Mother 

371
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,446
- Pretend that told me something. 
- Pretend that told me something. 

372
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:02,993
I mean, its really cool 
Party say that, Judy. 

373
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:06,796
You, too. 
Bye. 

374
00:20:15,012 --> 00:20:16,414
Let me get this straight. 

375
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:19,547
You are telling me 
when you see "Karate Kid", 

376
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:22,203
- No fan for Daniel Son? 
- No. 

377
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,789
For those twists 
in "Hard to Kill"? 

378
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:28,130
Hans Gruber. 
International charming bandit. 

379
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:32,142
In the end, it is hard to kill. 
It is the character of the title. 

380
00:20:32,177 --> 00:20:35,125
Sure. 
"Club of the five"? 

381
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,883
The teacher who 
takes care of the arrest. 

382
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:40,498
He is the one guy 
USA movie that suit. 

383
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:43,416
I know. 
"Terminator of the Future"? 

384
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,265
What is the name 
the film, Robin? 

385
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:49,257
Who among us has 
not shed a tear 

386
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:54,100
when the red olhinho it 
he did not kill people? 

387
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,713
Sorry, this movie ... 

388
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,659
Never watch 
movie with you. 

389
00:21:01,694 --> 00:21:04,325
Not trying to help him.

390
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
