《絕命律師》前請提要
Previously, on "Better Call Saul."

32
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,590
前兩晚  我聽到了槍聲
Last two nights, I heard gun shots.

33
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,050
那你和凱莉要離開這棟房子
We're getting you and Kaylee out of this house.

34
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,640
五萬塊  槍是你的
50,000 and the gun is yours.

35
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,140
如果你碰巧正在尋求改變
If you're pondering a change,

我對哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所沒有怨言
I have no complaints about HHM.

39
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,650
你進戴維斯梅因律所是為了我
You took the Davis and Main job because of me.

40
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,090
我去那里工作是因為這是正確的決定
I took that job because it was the right decision.

41
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:24,280
我得到了我想要的
I got what I wanted.

42
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,290
你可以得到你想要的一切
You could have everything you ever wanted.

還有什么不滿意的
What's not to love about that?

44

Hi. How are ya?

你好  先生
Hello, sir.

51
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,350
不知道你能不能幫我個忙
Uh, I was wondering if maybe you could help me.

52
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,220
什么事
Yeah?

53
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,540
我今早開車進城
Well, I drove into the city this morning.

54
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,640
通常我都搭火車  但今天特別趕時間
U-usually, I take the train, but I was in just such a rush

55
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,000
趕著給我兒子弗萊迪買藥
to get some medicine for my son, Freddie.

56
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,010
他有癲癇
He has epilepsy.

57
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,010
今天早上發作的時候
He had an attack this morning, but during his fit,

58
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,370
打翻了我妻子手中的藥
he knocked the bottle of medicine out of my wife's hand

59
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,890
砰一聲  撒了一地
and just -- bam, one huge puddle.

60
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,070
真糟糕
That's terrible.

61
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,990
長話短說吧  我開車進城
Well, long story short -- drove into town,

62
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,380
身上所有錢都拿去買了藥
bought the new medicine with every last nickel in my pocket,

63
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,310
接著我的車就拋錨了
and then my car died.

64
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,510
我的天  這實在...
Oh, god, that's -- that's just, uh...

65
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,460
我知道
I know.

66
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,440
屋漏偏逢連夜雨  對吧
When it rains, it pours, right?

67
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,860
我試著發動  怎么也點不著
I-I tried the ignition, just nothin' -- not firing.

68
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,810
總之  我只知道
And, anyway, now I've convinced myself

69
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,520
在我帶藥回家之前
that Freddie's ‭gonna have another seizure

70
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,410
弗萊迪的癲癇隨時會再次發作
before I get back with the medicine.

71
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,250
要是你能幫我  我會感激不盡
So, i-if you can help me, I would be so grateful.

72
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,620
我可以幫你檢查一下車子
Well, I could come out and check your car for ya.

73
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,020
可能只是火花塞的問題
You know, ‭maybe it's just a spark plug.

74
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,690
我儲藏室里有一盒火花塞
I-I-I got a box of plugs back in the stockroom.

75
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,110
謝謝  我很感激
Thanks, ‭and I-I appreciate that,

76
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,630
但如果你能給我五塊就好了...
but if you could possibly just spare $5 instead...

77
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,840
我寧可打車也不愿再折騰我那破車
I'd rather grab a cab than take a chance with my old clunker.

78
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,670
好啊  五元
Yeah, $5.

79
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,410
如果能給的話
I-if you can spare it.

80
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,930
行  當然
Yeah, okay, sure.

81
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,210
爸  過來一下
Dad, c'mere!

82
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,420
過來一下
C'mere!

83
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,980
爸  這是詐騙  跟上周那個乞丐一樣
Dad, it's a rip-off, just like that bum from last week.

鎮上的騙棍都知道
Every grifter in town knows that

86
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,760
這里是騙取施舍的好地點
this is the spot to come for an easy handout.

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
"騙棍"  你哪里學來的詞
Grifter? Where in the world did you learn that word?

88
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,830
爸  他鬼話連篇
Dad, his story's baloney.

89
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,800
他多半根本沒有兒子
He probably doesn't even have a son.

90
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,640
他在敲詐你
He's conning you.

91
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,930
吉米  萬一你錯了呢
Jimmy... What if you're wrong?

92
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,660
這樣吧
Y-you know what?

93
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,710
很抱歉麻煩你們  我這就走
Sorry to bother you folks. I-I'm gonna get outta here.

00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,800
-我這就...  -不不不

沒事  這樣吧
Of course, and -- and you know what?

101
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,520
我去后面儲藏室
I'm gonna go back in the stockroom.

102
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,680
找點火花塞
I'm gonna find those spark plugs.

103
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,420
或許能幫你把車發動  如何
Maybe we'll get your car started for you, okay?

104
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,870
來吧  吉米  幫我看一會兒行嗎
Come on, Jimmy. Just man the till, okay?

105
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,350
我馬上回來
And I'll just be back in a jiff, okay?

106
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,190

How much for a carton of Kools?

107
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,030
四塊錢
4 bucks.

是你的槍嗎  厄門紹特先生
Was it your gun, Mr. Ehrmantraut?

他沒這么說
No, he's not saying that.

能讓厄門紹特先生自己說嗎
Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?

00:07:02,269 --> 00:07:03,619
槍不是塞拉曼加的
The gun wasn't Salamanca's.

142

我只知道這么多
That's all I can tell you.

143
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:06,499
你原來說是他的
You told us it was.

你說塞拉曼加掏出槍對著你
You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.

145

他沒有
Well, he didn't.

146
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:13,539

- Why are you changing your story? ‭- Good citizenship.

槍上只有一個人的指紋
Look, there was only one set of prints on the gun --

148

Salamanca's.

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:19,339
槍怎么可能不是他的呢
How's that gonna happen if it wasn't his?

這個就不能問我的委托人了  對吧
That's not really for my client to say, now, is it?

他又不是鑒定專家

我是說有好多可能性
I mean, ‭the possibilities are endless.

塞拉曼加威脅你了嗎  厄門紹特先生

槍是最關鍵的  你們知道
The gun makes all the difference. You know that.

Okay, that's it. We're done. Okay. Let's go.

You're doing the right the thing.

169
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:28,679
這個叫塞拉曼加的
This Salamanca character?

170
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,039
簡直是瘋子
Maniac.

29
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,959


171
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:31,909
我自己也
I had my own...

172
00:08:34,619 --> 00:08:35,729
跟他打過交道
...thing with him.

173
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,309
之前因為利益沖突啊啥的  就沒有說
I didn't wanna say it before because of conflict of interest,

174
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,749
但是他確實是個神經病
yadda yadda, but, yeah, he's nuts.

175
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,389
他把我五花大綁帶到沙漠里
I'm talking he had me hog-tied in the desert

176
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:49,279
拿槍頂著我腦袋
with a gun to my head.

177
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,239
當著我的面折了兩個家伙的腿
Broke two guys' legs right in front of me.

178
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,509
要是我沒說服他  他可能就把他們...
If I hadn't talked him down, he probably would've...

179
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:59,569
血淋淋的細節就不談了  總之很慘
I'll spare you the gory details, but it was a deal and a half --

180
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:01,349
讓人永生難忘啊
not something you forget.

181
00:09:03,449 --> 00:09:05,059
你跟我說這些干嘛
And you're telling me this why?

182
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,009
別太苛責自己
Don't be too tough on yourself.

183
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,459
人們說  謹慎即大勇
Like they say, discretion is the better part of valor.

184
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,109
換我也會這樣做
I would've done the same thing.

185
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:16,719
今天算我幫你  不收費
Hey, today, ‭it's on me -- no charge.

186
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,169
你搭下趟電梯
You take the next one.

187
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,739
照常收費
And bill me.

188
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:29,219
忘恩負義
Ingrate.

189
00:09:33,109 --> 00:09:33,819
喂  吉米
Hey, Jimmy.

190
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:35,249
你跟霍華德說了嗎
Did you tell Howard yet?

191
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,229
我現在還不能說
I can't really talk right now.

192
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,429
你沒跟他說啊
You didn't tell him.

193
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:41,159
還沒  等確定了我才能說
No, and I won't until it's rock-solid,

194
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,019
要等到錄用通知書到手
like offer-letter-in-hand solid.

195
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:45,139
你什么時候能拿到錄用通知書
When are you gonna get that offer letter?

196
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,969
下禮拜四吧
‭I'm guessing next Thursday,

197
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:48,599
跟合伙人面試過以后
After my interview with the partners.

198
00:09:48,609 --> 00:09:51,439
-那只是走個流程吧  -差不多
- Yeah, but that's just a formality, right? ‭- Basically.

199
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:52,519
希望是
I hope.

200
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:53,809
到底給你開的什么條件
What's the offer you think?

201
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:55,619
我是說實質的
I mean, brass tacks.

202
00:09:56,489 --> 00:09:58,679
比不上你在戴維斯梅因律所的
Well, it's not gonna be as much as your deal at Davis & Main,

203
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:00,719
但是兩年后可以成為合伙人
but they'll make me partner in two years,

204
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:03,669
而在HHM需要五年或者永遠不能
as opposed to somewhere between five years and never at HHM.

205
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,039
不錯嘛
Not too shabby.

206
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,059
還幫我還法學院貸款
Yeah, and then there's my law-school loans.

207
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:08,629
還要還多少  幾千塊嗎
What is that -- a couple grand by now?

208
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:09,449
只有幾千就好了
I wish.

209
00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:10,469
我還有其他開支
I had to finance the whole thing

210
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,739
當時還拿的是收發室工資
and was only making mailroom money.

211
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,939
還剩一萬五沒有還完
I've got ‭like $15,000 left.

212
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:16,559
斯韋卡特還真是想挖你啊
Schweikart wants you bad, huh?

213
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:17,989
但是  吉米
But, J -- but, Jimmy,

214
00:10:17,989 --> 00:10:19,229
你找我有什么事
Did you have something you needed?

215
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:20,969
不不  就打電話問問
No, no. I was just checking in.

216
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:22,589
一會兒見  好嗎
Uh, I'll see you later, okay?

217
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:24,339
如果你表現好的話
If you play your cards right.

218
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:25,179
拜拜
Bye.

219
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:35,399
奧馬爾  你在哪
Omar, where are you?

220
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:39,879
奧馬爾  幫我寫封信行嗎
Omar, would you be so kind as to take a letter for me?

221
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,659
"最親愛的克利福德"  不  太過了
"Dearest Clifford..." No, that's too much.

222
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,739
"親愛的克利福"
"Dear Cliff..."

223
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,259
你覺得應該叫克利福德還是克里福
Whaddaya think -- Clifford or Cliff?

224
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,809
我不知道  要看是什么信吧
I don't -- it depends on what the letter is.

225
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,569
沒事  你看著寫吧
That's fine. Treat yourself.

226
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:56,179
親愛的  加什么都可以
Uh, "Dear..." Whoever you put in.

227
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:00,559
接下來  "我的心沉重得就像"
Continuing -- ‭uh, "My heart is heavy as --"

228
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,149
不行  聽起來像是身體出狀況了
No, that sounds like a medical condition.

229
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,199
這么寫吧
Let's go with, um,

230
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,869
"我懷著沉重的心情"  好吧
"It is with a heavy heart," Okay?

231
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:13,339
"我懷著沉重的心情向戴維斯梅因律所
"It is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation

232
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,239
"正式提交辭呈"
"to Davis & Main."

233
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:17,619
用"提交"比"上交"好吧
"Tender" is better than "Submit," Yeah?

234
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:18,519
你說辭呈嗎
Resignation?

235
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,599
是啊
Yes, sir.

236
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,659
"向戴維斯梅因律所提交...
So, "Tender," Blah, blah, blah, "To Davis & Main.

237
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:26,399
"在這里工作的日子
"These have been, uh,

238
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,999
"是我一生中最有職業成就感的一段時間"
"some of the most professionally satisfying days of my life..."

239
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:35,399
怎么了
What's wrong?

240
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,359
是不是說得有點過了
Do you think ‭I'm laying it on too thick?

241
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:38,599
不是...
No, um...

242
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:43,359
我只是沒想到你在這里這么受氣
I just didn't realize how unhappy you were here.

243
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,589
不是受氣
Not unhappy, per se.

244
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:48,409
而是...不開心
More like... Not happy.

245
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:51,799
我完全沒看出來
I had no idea.

246
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,279
不是你的錯  伙計
‭It's not your fault, buddy.

247
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,209
你很能干
It's just -- you're top-notch.

248
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:57,559
我們寫到哪了
Where were we?

249
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,339
可是你那么努力才爭取到這一切
It's just y-you worked so hard to get here,

250
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,269
現在放棄的話你會失去很多
and it's so much to give up --

251
00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:05,039
單說你的特別待遇
I-I mean, the perks alone.

252
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:05,839
是啊
Yeah.

253
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,499
公寓確實...不錯
The apartment is, uh... Yeah.

254
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:10,119
還有車
And the car.

255
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,419
那輛車整體上是相當不錯的
For the most part, car is pretty sweet.

256
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,689
還有簽約獎金
And the bonus.

257
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,969
獎金已經到手了
The bonus is a done deal.

258
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,429
他們早就把支票給我了
It's -- ‭they already cut me the check.

259
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,449
獎金我可以留著
I get to keep the bonus.

260
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,319
除非你辭職
Not if you quit.

261
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,979
在一定時間內辭職  我記得你的是一年內
Before a certain term -- I think yours is a year --

262
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,849
你就要把錢還回來的
You have to pay the money back.

263
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:37,429
是...
It's, um...

264
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,289

266
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:46,809
應該是這兒
I think it's right, uh, there.

267
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:47,669
我看看
Yeah.

268
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:01,519
奧馬爾  這個
Omar...That whole, ‭uh,

辭職信的事情
letter-of-resignation thing

270
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,049
我不是認真的  一個字也不作數
that -- I didn't mean that, not a word.

271
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,049
我...
I...

272
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,499
我只是
I-I'm so incredibly

273

壓力太大了
stressed out.

274

壓力太大
I'm stressed out.

275
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:20,509
而且  坦白說
And frank-- to be honest,

276
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,589
適應戴維斯梅因的工作節奏
it has been more of an adjustment

277
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:27,049
比我預想中更困難
than I expected here at Davis & Main.

278
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:31,319
所以我有點  別把我剛才說的告訴別人
And so I just -- don't repeat what I said to anyone.

279
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:33,779
我就覺得有些不對勁
I figured ‭something had to be wrong --

280
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,549
肯定不對勁  因為你很喜歡在這里工作吧
I mean, really wrong because you like it here, right?

281
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:39,549
愛死了
I love it.

282
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:43,749
剛剛  就當是一瞬間失去理智吧
It -- call it ?A momentary lapse of reason.

283

我們
And but just --

284
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:50,109
我們忘了這回事吧
Let's just rewind the tape and, you know, forget this happened.

285
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:54,259
沒問題  絕對不說出去
Mum's the word. No problem.

286
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,659
我感覺好多了
Yeah, I feel better already.

287
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:59,069
有時候必須把想說的大聲發泄出來
I -- you know, sometimes, you have to say something out loud

288
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:01,759
才知道那聽起來有多荒唐
to hear how crazy it sounds.

Because, uh, you've got suction that way, leverage.

所以我剛才說的你一個字都聽不懂
So you don't understand a word I've been saying.

317
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:36,691
那好吧
Well...

318
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:38,571
晚安
Good night.

319
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,711
來  你試一下  倒著吸
No, you try. Backwards.

320
00:17:52,151 --> 00:17:53,111
不好意思
Excuse me.

321
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:55,191
請大家注意一下
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

322
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,431
都能聽見嗎  很好
Everyone can hear me? Good.

323
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,031
坦白說  我從沒想到
Frankly, this is not a conversation

324
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,101
在自己的職業生涯中要進行這種講話
I ever thought I would have in my professional career,

325
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,981
但我注意到
but it's been brought to my attention

326
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,831
洗手間出了狀況
that we have an ongoing situation in the washroom.

327
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:07,471
有人上完不沖水
Someone is not flushing.

328
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:09,811
一次是意外  兩次也是
Once is an accident -- maybe even twice.

329
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:11,421
三次就形成模式了
Three times -- no, that's a pattern.

330
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:12,871
而且還不是小便
And we're not talking about a number one.

331
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:14,731
是的  謝謝你  艾琳
Yes. Thank you, Erin.

332
00:18:14,891 --> 00:18:16,801
我不是來給誰難堪的
Now, I'm not here to shame anyone --

333
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:19,041
我都不想知道是誰干的  但是...
Nor do I even want to know who did it, but --

334
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:21,331
克利福德  是我干的
Uh, Cliff, it was me.

335
00:18:21,581 --> 00:18:23,121
吉米  我說了我不想知道
Jimmy, I just said I didn't want to know.

336
00:18:23,121 --> 00:18:25,651
我們需要節約水
Hey, we need the water.

337
00:18:26,161 --> 00:18:28,151
我聽說圣達菲的水位
I read somewhere that the Santa Fe watershed

338
00:18:28,151 --> 00:18:31,271
今年下降了五厘米
is down ‭two full inches this year.

339
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:33,191
每沖一次水
Every time you flush a toilet,

340
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,381
都會浪費一加侖水  一加侖呢
you waste a gallon of water -- a gallon!

341
00:18:36,401 --> 00:18:38,171
還有比不沖水更好的節約方法嗎
What could be greater than this?

342
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,921
那些都是低流馬桶  吉米
They're low-flow toilets, Jimmy.

343
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,561
從現在開始  你要沖水
From now on, flush.

344
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:44,031
低流  不錯啊
Low-flow -- that's good.

345
00:18:44,031 --> 00:18:45,111
好主意
Good thinking.

346
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:22,011
什么聲音
What is that?

347
00:19:35,071 --> 00:19:37,391
吉米  里面怎么回事
Jimmy, ‭what's goin' on in there?

348
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:39,961
吉米
Jimmy!

349
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,541
你隔著門也能聽見嗎
Oh, you could hear this through the door?

350
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,951
我沒注意到  抱歉
I didn't realize. I'm sorry.

351
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,611
你在干什么
What do you think you're doing?

352
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,131
我接受了你的建議
Uh, I took your advice.

353
00:19:47,131 --> 00:19:48,591
我在釋放壓力
I'm blowing off steam.

354
00:19:49,081 --> 00:19:50,411
釋放壓力
Blowing off steam?

355
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:52,891
是啊  就像你彈吉他一樣
Yeah, yeah, like you and your guitar, you know?

356
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:55,511
不得不說  你說得沒錯
Um, I got to say -- you're right.

357
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:57,701
這非常有助于緩解壓力
I mean, ‭it really helps with stress.

358
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:00,141
聲音不怎么好聽  但我剛學
I know I don't sound very good, but I'm just learning.

359
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:03,051
我聽說關鍵是要一直讓這個氣囊充氣
I heard that the key is you have to keep this bag inflated.

360
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:04,231
夠了
Enough!

361
00:20:04,231 --> 00:20:05,791
趕緊給我放下來
Put that down. Now.

362
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:07,521
你來我辦公室一趟
I want you in my office.

363
00:20:17,661 --> 00:20:18,501
你贏了
You win.

364
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:20,651
我贏了什么
What do I win?

365
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,831
你被炒了
You're fired.

366
00:20:22,241 --> 00:20:24,121
什么  克利福德  如果是因為那個風笛...
What? Cliff, if this is about the bagpipes --

367
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,451
不是因為那個風笛
It's not about the bagpipes.

368
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:28,571
當然是因為風笛了
Well, of course it's the bagpipes.

369
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,071
是因為風笛  是因為不沖水
It's the bagpipes, ‭and it's the not flushing

370
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,981
還因為你這身...扎眼的所謂西裝
And this -- this optical migraine you call a business suit.

371
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,571
是因為...是因為你想保住你的獎金
It's about -- it's about you keeping your bonus.

372
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,971
都是因為這個
That's what this is about.

373
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:42,101
你最近一直在溫習合同法吧
Been brushing up on ‭your contract law, haven't you?

374
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,811
你顯然想離開這里
You want outta here, clearly,

375
00:20:43,811 --> 00:20:46,201
但你不能辭職  否則獎金不保
But you can't just up and quit and expect to keep your bonus.

376
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,341
如果我因為你的不當行為解雇你
And if I fire you for cause --

377
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:49,261
在你拍廣告時我就應該炒了你...
Like I should have done for the TV commercial --

378
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:50,431
獎金也沒有
Again, no bonus.

379
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:51,761
但是
However,

380
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:55,081
如果無緣無故  就因為你是個混蛋而解雇你
if I fire you not for cause but for being an all-around jackass...

381
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,381
你就能得逞了
Yeah.. ‭Hurray for you.

382
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,701
如果你認為我有什么瀆職行為...
If you think there's been some malfeasance here --

383
00:20:59,701 --> 00:21:00,891
省省吧
Oh, save it.

384
00:21:01,071 --> 00:21:03,411
我可以和你爭  但我不想為你浪費時間
I could fight you on this, but you're not worth my time.

385
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,671
你最好趕緊走人
I'd rather just have you gone.

386
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:10,441
你這么想我很抱歉
I'm sorry you feel that way.

387
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:13,921
我去...收拾東西
I'll just, uh... pack up.

388
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,961
首先...行行好
First... Do me the favor

389
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,201
不要把我當傻子
of not treating me like a fool for once.

390
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,021
告訴我  我到底對你哪里不好了
Tell me -- ‭how exactly did I mistreat you?

391
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,011
我到底做了什么讓你這樣對我
What did I do to deserve is kind of behavior?

392
00:21:24,011 --> 00:21:26,211
我們給了你機會  鼓勵你發展
We gave you opportunities, encouraged you to excel.

393
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:27,581
給你配了車  配了房
We got you a car, an apartment.

394
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:29,351
還有黃檀木辦公桌
Hell, that cocobolo desk.

395
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:31,001
你在這兒看到過那樣的桌子嗎
Do you see a desk like that in here?

396
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:33,111
你根本沒有認真考慮
You never gave this a chance.

397
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,121
為什么
Why?

398
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,081
我努力想要適應  真的
I tried to make it work -- really, I-I did.

399
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:42,431
我只是...不適合這里
I'm just... a square peg.

400
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:45,071
如果你早就知道  為什么還要接受這份工作
If you knew that, why did you take the job?

401
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,951
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,211
那張桌子多少錢
How much was the desk?

403
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:56,961
七千
$7,000.

404
00:21:59,191 --> 00:22:00,531
我會給你開張支票
I'll write you a check.

405
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:03,441
隨便  雖然不知道有什么用
Fine, ‭for whatever good that does.

406
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,281
帶上你的桌子離開這里
Take your desk and get out.

407
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:12,041
克利福德  不管怎么樣  我覺得你是一個好人
Hey, Cliff, for what it's worth, I think you're a good guy.

408
00:22:13,381 --> 00:22:15,391
不管怎么樣  我覺得你是一個混蛋
For what it's worth, I think you're an asshole.

409
00:22:45,995 --> 00:22:49,235
{\an8}哈姆林先生
抱歉通知你  我將辭去

410
00:23:02,045 --> 00:23:03,745
門開著
Uh, yeah, it's open.

411
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:08,825
-吉米  -我能和你談談嗎
- Jimmy. ‭- Hey. Can I talk to you for a minute?

412
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:10,575
霍華德知道你來嗎
Does Howard know you're here?

413
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,545
當然不知道  我溜進來的
God, no. I snuck in.

414
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,515
好吧  但是快點
Well, uh, yeah, but make it quick.

415
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:18,185
其實  我們能不能去會議室談
Actually, can we, uh, talk in the conference room?

416
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,135
為什么
Why?

417
00:23:19,135 --> 00:23:20,885
這樣更正式
It's just more appropriate.

418
00:23:20,885 --> 00:23:24,185
四點之前沒人要開會  我看過了
Um, no one's gonna need it till 4:00 -- I checked.

419
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:26,145
行嗎
Please?

420
00:23:26,145 --> 00:23:27,515
最多十分鐘
10 minutes, tops.

421
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,105
你先請
After you.

422
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,145
坐吧
‭Have a seat.

423
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,085
怎么...怎么回事
What -- what is going on?

424
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:36,055
說吧
Spill it.

425
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:39,765
好吧
Okay.

426
00:23:40,645 --> 00:23:43,185
斯韋卡特考科利會幫你付清欠哈姆林麥吉爾的債務
Schweikart and Cokely will pay your debt to HHM

427
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,585
并在兩年之后將你提拔為合伙人吧
and make you a partner in two years, correct?

428
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,775
顯然是的
Apparently.

429
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:49,095
是這么約定的
That's the deal, yes.

430
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:49,965
怎么了
Why?

431
00:23:50,635 --> 00:23:52,405
要不要考慮一個更好的工作機會
Would you entertain a better offer?

432
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,835
誰給的  哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所嗎
From whom -- HHM?

433
00:23:55,905 --> 00:23:56,915
我
From me.

434
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:00,095
我明天就讓你成為合伙人
I'll make you a partner tomorrow.

435
00:24:01,295 --> 00:24:03,955
以此為證
Consider that proof of concept --

436
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:08,015
韋克斯勒麥吉爾合伙律所
Wexler-Mcgill, partners at law.

437
00:24:08,075 --> 00:24:09,785
你和我一起
You and me, together.

438
00:24:11,385 --> 00:24:13,585
斯韋卡特可以幫你償還債務  我也可以
If Schweikart can pay your debt, so can I.

439
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,375
再加上我的簽約獎金
And with my signing bonus,

440
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,245
你就可以從頭開始了
you'll have a clean slate.

441
00:24:17,265 --> 00:24:18,565
前程無限好
The sky's the limit.

442
00:24:19,135 --> 00:24:20,295
我倆合作很好的
Hey, we're good together.

443
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:21,655
這你知道的
You know that.

444
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,245
還猶豫什么
So, what's stopping us?

445
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,405
全身心投入  做自己的老板
Let's jump in with both feet, be our own bosses,

446
00:24:26,405 --> 00:24:27,905
共建屬于我們的未來
build our own future.

447
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:31,465
"做自己的老板"
"Be our own bosses."

448
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:33,945
哪里來的委托人呢
What about clients?

449
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:36,085
你剛剛簽了梅薩維德銀行  是吧
Mesa Verde just signed with you, didn't they?

450
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,865
想把他們挖走很難
It'll be a hard sell to take them with me.

451
00:24:37,865 --> 00:24:40,115
那就再找一個梅薩維德銀行
So, then there will be another Mesa Verde.

452
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,195
這全都靠你  金
That was all you, Kim.

453
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,525
你能簽下這個  再簽一個有何難
You did it once. You can do it again.

454
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:48,625
你說得輕松
You make it sound easy.

455
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:51,125
不  你面前的這個男人
No. You're talking to a guy

456
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,195
可是在美甲店里蝸居了多年的
who lived ‭in the back of a nail salon.

457
00:24:53,655 --> 00:24:55,785
當然不容易  肯定要付出很多心血和汗水
No, this is gonna be a whole lot of blood, sweat, and tears --

458
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,375
至少一開始肯定很艱難
at least, at the start.

459
00:24:57,405 --> 00:25:01,065
但是最終我們會擁有完全屬于我們的生意
But in the end, we'll have a practice that is 100% ours,

460
00:25:01,065 --> 00:25:02,335
很值得
that's worth it.

461
00:25:02,965 --> 00:25:05,065
也有可能失敗  兩手空空
Or we fail ‭and end up with nothing.

462
00:25:05,415 --> 00:25:06,725
你說得對  這就是一場賭博
Well, you're right -- it's a gamble.

463
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:07,795
這是一場豪賭
It's a big one.

464
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:09,765
沒錯  但你是把賭注壓在自己身上
Yeah, ‭but you're betting on yourself,

465
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,585
就我看來  你贏的幾率很大
and from where I sit, the odds are in your favor.

466
00:25:12,585 --> 00:25:14,385
你是一名出色的律師
You're an amazing lawyer.

467
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:16,635
這是你向世界展示的機會
This is your chance to show the world that.

468
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:22,235
那我為什么不去斯韋卡特呢
So, why not go to Schweikart?

469
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:23,065
他們也會讓我成為合伙人
They'll make me partner,

470
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,805
而且他們律所可靠  聲譽又好
and they are a solid, respectable firm.

471
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,925
這一點無可否認
You can't deny that.

472
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:28,315
你不該只滿足于這樣的橫向調動
You deserve more than just a lateral move.

473
00:25:28,535 --> 00:25:30,695
這就是斯韋卡特代表的
Bottom line -- that's what Schweikart represents.

474
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,185
他只是另一個霍華德·哈姆林罷了
He's just Howard Hamlin by a different name.

475
00:25:33,525 --> 00:25:34,765
你一直在說我和斯韋卡特
You keep talking about me and Schweikart.

476
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:36,275
那你和戴維斯梅因怎么辦
What about you and Davis & Main?

477
00:25:36,595 --> 00:25:38,625
結束了  我今天辭職了
That's over. I quit today.

478
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,325
嚴格來講  是我被炒了
Well, technically, I got fired.

479
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,695
怎么了
What happened?

480
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:46,405
互相看不順眼  而且由來已久
It was mutual and a long time coming.

481
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:48,405
這份工作從一開始就不適合我
That job was never the right fit for me.

482
00:25:48,405 --> 00:25:49,595
這份才是
This is.

483
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:56,215
如果我們倆要成為律所合伙人
If we're gonna be law partners,

484
00:25:56,215 --> 00:25:57,555
有一件事我需要確認
I need to know one thing.

485
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:02,325
你會是什么樣的律師
What kind of lawyer are you gonna be?

486
00:26:03,485 --> 00:26:05,855
我不是指你要專攻哪一方面  我指的是
I don't mean what kind of law are you gonna practice. I mean

487
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:09,115
你會照章辦事嗎
are you gonna play it straight,

488
00:26:09,845 --> 00:26:10,945
還是繼續
or are you gonna...

489
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:13,305
耍各種花招
be colorful?

490
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:17,975
我會照章辦事  絕不出格
I'm gonna play it straight, right down the line.

491
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:21,175
我會萬分謹慎
I'm gonna dot every "I," and I'm gonna cross every...

492
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,685
如果我不能做自己  那這又有什么意義
There's no point in me doing this if I can't be myself.

493
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,485
每一次我照著別人的方法來做事
Every time I try to do things someone else's way,

494
00:26:37,485 --> 00:26:38,705
我都會把事情搞砸
it blows up in my face.

495
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:41,045
在戴維斯梅因律所就是如此
That's what happened at Davis & Main.

496
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:42,435
看看結果如何
Look how that turned out.

497
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:46,365
我差點毀了你的事業  惹毛了所有人
I almost derailed your career, pissed everyone off.

498
00:26:47,635 --> 00:26:50,605
我一直都努力活在別人的期望中
I've been trying to be the person someone else wants me to be for...

499
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:52,535
我也不知道有多久了
I don't know how long.

500
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:54,175
一開始是查克
I mean, first, it was Chuck,

501
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:57,285
然后是你  這并不是你的錯
then it was you -- ‭and that's not your fault.

502
00:26:57,335 --> 00:26:58,565
那是我自己的選擇
That was my choice.

503
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,455
但是如果我們要這么做
But if we're gonna do this,

504
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,905
我要做我自己
I got to go into it as me.

505
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:05,475
所以  沒錯
So, yeah.

506
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,885
我估計會繼續耍小花招吧
Colorful, I guess.

507
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:09,825
你覺得怎么樣
What do you say?

508
00:27:12,345 --> 00:27:13,325
我只是
I just...

509
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,845
我不明白為什么我倆非要在一起工作呢
I don't see ‭why it's so important to you that we work together.

510
00:27:18,235 --> 00:27:19,385
我們已經...
I mean, we're already...

511
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,345
你為什么還要拉我入伙呢
‭Why do you need me for this?

512
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:24,025
我不是需要你  我想要你
I don't need you -- I want you.

513
00:27:25,985 --> 00:27:27,045
你已經擁有我了...
You've got me...

514
00:27:29,035 --> 00:27:30,665
只不過不是合伙人
Just not as a law partner.

515
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,045
我得回去工作了
I have to get back to work.

516
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,365
你沒事吧
You okay?

517
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:46,175
沒事
Yeah.

518
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:48,105
沒事  我很好
No, I'm fine.

519
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:50,565
去吧
Go on.

520
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:54,805
那一會見
See you later? ‭

521
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:56,405
一會見
Yeah.

522
00:28:03,835 --> 00:28:06,705
你也看到了  這房子可以拎包入住
It's move-in ready, as you can see.

523
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:09,025
在過去三年里已經重新裝修過了
And they've renovated within the past three years --

524
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:11,345
地板和廚房都是新的
new floors, new kitchen.

525
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:15,025
空間也很大
And it's a good amount of space.

526
00:28:17,385 --> 00:28:19,225
你覺得這房子不算太過吧
It's not too much house, you think?

527
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:20,895
一點也不過分
No, not at all.

528
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,065
看看那后院啊
And look at that backyard.

529
00:28:23,985 --> 00:28:25,175
他們把小房子都留在這了
They're leaving the playhouse.

530
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,555
是不是很棒
Isn't that amazing? ‭

531
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:28,745
凱莉肯定愛死了
Kaylee will go crazy for that.

532
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:31,765
-她肯定進去了就不想出來  -是吧
- You'll never get her outta there. - I know, right?

533
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:33,595
最重要的是
And the most important part --

534
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,265
周圍的學校很不錯  鄰居也很棒
the schools are good and the neighborhood is great.

535
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:39,245
我打了本警區的電話  問了犯罪率
I called the local precinct and asked about the crime stats --

536
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:40,955
這里是市里最低的之一
they're some of the lowest in the city.

537
00:28:40,955 --> 00:28:42,915
而且  他的語氣很好
Plus, I got a good vibe from him.

538
00:28:42,925 --> 00:28:44,905
聽起來很負責任
Like, they sounded really responsive.

539
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:46,365
這很不錯
That sounds perfect.

540
00:28:46,615 --> 00:28:47,495
是的
Yeah.

541
00:28:48,395 --> 00:28:49,555
你喜歡嗎
Do you like it?

542
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,765
你開心我就開心
If you're happy, I'm happy.

543
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:52,935
你喜歡嗎
Do you like it?

544
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:55,455
是  我喜歡  但是我
Yeah, I do, but I'm --

545
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:58,615
-但是什么  -需要一大筆錢
- But what? - ‭It's a lot of money.

546
00:28:58,825 --> 00:29:01,165
我知道我一直重復  但確實要很多錢
I know -- I'm like ‭a broken record, but it is.

547
00:29:01,175 --> 00:29:02,175
這你不必擔心
You don't worry about that.

548
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,805
無論多少錢都要買下來
We'll make it happen, whatever the cost.

549
00:29:03,805 --> 00:29:05,675
-麥克  -我說真的
- Mike. - ‭Hey, I'm serious.

550
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:07,225
別多想了
Not another thought.

551
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:09,385
你想要就買吧
If you want it, it's yours.

552
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,015
房子怎么樣
How we looking?

553
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,055
非常棒
Oh, it's perfect.

554
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,955
-成交  -非常好
- Let's do it. ‭- Fantastic.

555
00:29:25,955 --> 00:29:27,025
你們還有時間嗎
Do you have another hour?

556
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:28,205
我們可以去辦公室
We could go down to the office,

557
00:29:28,215 --> 00:29:29,785
申請貸款預批之類的
get the pre-approval in order, all that.

558
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:31,385
可以  我們在那兒見
Oh, sounds good. We'll meet you there.

559
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,775
行  一會兒見
Sure. See you in a few.

560
00:29:33,995 --> 00:29:36,565
我終于能松口氣了
Oh, I feel like I can finally breathe.

561
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,285
行  我很高興
Good. I'm glad.

562
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,115
你想坐我的車嗎
You wanna ride together?

563
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:43,695
不  我跟著你開
No, I'll follow you over.

564
00:29:44,585 --> 00:29:45,425
車不錯
Car looks good.

565
00:29:45,425 --> 00:29:47,385
連剮蹭的痕跡都看不出來
Wouldn't even know ‭you so much as scratched it.

566
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,025
沒錯  修車工技術好
Yeah, um, my guy knows his stuff.

567

抱歉  剛才紅綠燈差點把你弄丟了
Sorry I almost lost you at that light.

571
00:31:06,515 --> 00:31:07,525
沒事
No problem.

572
00:31:14,025 --> 00:31:15,385
小心魚缸
Watch the fish tank.

573
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:21,575
左邊
To the left.

574
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,295

還行
Yeah.

580

這東西要怎么處理
‭What should I... do with this?

581
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:51,665
丟到路邊去
Dump it ‭on the side of the road --

582
00:31:51,795 --> 00:31:53,665
我當初也是在路邊撿的
That's where I got it in the first place.

583
00:32:08,545 --> 00:32:09,955
-給  伙計  -不用
- Hey, buddy. - ‭Oh, no.

-你幫我太多了  去喝一杯呢  -真的沒關系
- This is over and above. ‭How about a drink?‬ - That's okay, really.

585
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:13,595
-我想喝一杯  -不用了
- I know I could use one. - ‭No.

Come on. I'm buying.

我真不用  開長途車
No, I'm good. Long drive.

588

喝些黃瓜水再上路
Cucumber water for the road?

你現在準備怎么辦
What are you gonna do now?

593
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,175
勇往直前
Onward and upward.

594

謝謝  奧馬爾
Thanks, Omar.

這里是詹姆斯·M·麥吉爾先生的律所
You've reached the law offices of James M. McGill, esquire.

598
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:17,535

Hi.

這里是吉米·麥吉爾的律所
You've reached the law offices of Jimmy McGill.

601
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:38,195
請留言
Please leave a message,

603
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:41,335
謝謝
Thanks.

604
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:48,795
簡易判決嗎  是的  我處理過六起
Summary judgments? Uh, yes. I've handled six.

605
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:52,175
其實最近一起非常復雜
Actually, one recently was quite complex.

606
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:56,015
一起訴訟案  離婚不順造成的
It was a litigation -- the result of a nasty divorce.

607
00:34:56,015 --> 00:34:57,945
我的委托人起訴她以前的公司
My client was suing her former company,

608
00:34:57,945 --> 00:35:00,185
她和前夫在協議書中分了該公司的財產
which she and her ex had split in their settlement.

609
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:03,635
其中的問題讓我研究了幾周判例法
The issues involved had me chasing case law for weeks.

610
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,965
-誰審理的  -皮特曼法官
- Who heard it? ‭- Judge Pittman.

611
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:09,145
他很難纏啊
That guy -- he's a handful, huh?

612
00:35:09,145 --> 00:35:11,105
他有時候是很難搞
Well, he can be a tough nut to crack,

613
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:12,995
但他做出了有利于我的判決
but he did rule in my favor.

614
00:35:13,955 --> 00:35:16,085
行了  別總說法律了
All right, ‭enough about law, law, law.

615

我是中西部人

地圖上都沒有的小鎮

堪薩斯和內布拉斯加交界處

Which way was that?

最好的情況
Best case?

634
00:35:57,865 --> 00:36:00,845
可能是嫁給鎮上開加油站的那個人
Probably married to the guy that ran the town gas station.

635
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:03,035
也可能是在辛奇丁奇當個收銀員
Maybe cashiering down at the Hinky Dinky.

-辛奇什么  -辛奇丁奇

No, no, no, no. I'm happy to be confused with Howard.

怎么  你又覺得這么做不好了
‭What? You don't think it's a good idea now?

700

Good.

708
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:46,765
為此  我有個提議
To that end... I have a pitch for you.

709
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:57,905
不是韋克斯勒麥吉爾  而是韋克斯勒
Not Wexler-McGill, but Wexler...

710
00:40:58,645 --> 00:41:00,535
以及麥吉爾
and McGill.

711
00:41:01,455 --> 00:41:04,245
我們找間辦公室  平攤物業費
We find an office, ‭share the housekeeping costs,

712
00:41:04,245 --> 00:41:06,705
房租  電費  一切
the rent, electricity -- everything.

713
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:09,825
但我是律師金·韋克斯勒
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law,

714
00:41:09,825 --> 00:41:11,885
你是律師吉米·麥吉爾
and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law,

715
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:14,205
我們都可以按自己意愿執業
both free to practice as we see fit.

716
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:17,875
同一屋檐下兩間律所
Separate firms under one roof?

717
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,465
我們都要出城  為什么不拼車呢
We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?

718
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:24,245
你按你的方式來  我按我的來
You do things your way, and I do them mine.

719

我們有自由
We'll have freedom,

720
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:28,245
但也不會孤軍奮戰
but we aren't each trying to go it alone.

721
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:33,575
不是合伙人  而是一起工作的個體律師
Not partners -- ‭solo practitioners, together.

722
00:41:35,985 --> 00:41:36,965
你覺得怎么樣
What do you think?

723
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:39,435
我不知道說什么好
I don't know what to say.
