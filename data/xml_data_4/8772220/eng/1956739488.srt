1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,309
Completely.

2
00:00:01,311 --> 00:00:02,618
iEl amigo del cártel!

3
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:06,772
You hit?

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:09,500
You're in shock.

5
00:00:09,502 --> 00:00:11,293
You're his wife,

6
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:14,113
and you got scared enough to talk to me.

7
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,330
Just tell me where you sent him.

8
00:00:15,332 --> 00:00:16,873
I don't think so.

9
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:19,680
Jimmy?

10
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,516
Yeah.

11
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,835
It's me.

12
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,599
I'm okay.

13
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:53,071

14
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,938
You're sure?

15
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,683
Alright. Stay put, and call
me if there's a problem.

16
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:32,037
Doesn't look like anyone's
been down that road,

17
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,722
definitely no one official.

18
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,375
Bodies, trucks... it's all still there.

19
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,802
Couple of flatbeds headed their way.

20
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,395
They'll clear it all out.

21
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:42,214
Like it never happened.

22
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:44,550
And the one who followed you.

23
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:47,384
We'll be damn lucky if
we ever find that guy.

24
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:49,163
That'll have to do.

25
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:51,415
He's in the middle of nowhere.

26
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,910
Don't go to sleep yet.

27
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:57,963
We gotta work on your story.

28
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:02,968
Alright. Let's do it.

29
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:17,469
De Guzman. Jorge.

30
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:36,026
$7 million?

31
00:05:36,028 --> 00:05:37,294
Yep.

32
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,632
I'm fine.

33
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,577
$7 million.

34
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,414
Your client has $7 million.

35
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,141
Where'd it come from?

36
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:20,511
It's not for me to ask where
a client gets his money.

37
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,759
And just who exactly is your client?

38
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:30,397
Jorge de Guzman.

39
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:53,746
Yes, hello?

40
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,876
This is extra.

41
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:08,636
And now Mr. De Guzman?

42
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:24,485
Well.

43
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:27,655
You must have a story.

44
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:29,956
Car trouble.

45
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:33,385
Ah, broke down about six
miles from the pick-up site.

46
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,288
Y'know there's no cell
reception out there, right?

47
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:39,908
Car trouble.

48
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:42,920
Yeah. Just kaput.

49
00:07:44,398 --> 00:07:45,839
So, um...

50
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,675
why so long?

51
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:49,677
It's not that far back to the main road.

52
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,661
You didn't just hitchhike?

53
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:53,922
I thought of that, but, you know,

54
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:55,154
with $7 mil in cash,

55
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:57,756
I was kind of afraid
who might pick me up.

56
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,412
I didn't think it was worth the risk.

57
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,763
I walked north.

58
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:03,768
Probably not the smartest move,

59
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,935
but after a night lost in the desert,

60
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:09,947
I made it.

61
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:15,427
Well, that was the right call.

62
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,021
Hey, hey, you did good, eh?

63
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:24,194
Anyway, listen, I wouldn't be too happy.

64
00:08:24,196 --> 00:08:25,954
The $7 mil... it...

65
00:08:25,956 --> 00:08:28,273
it really sent up a huge flare.

66
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,942
They're looking into you.

67
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,719
I-I don't know how long

68
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:33,268
"Jorge de Guzman" is gonna hold up.

69
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,811
Hey, listen, by the time
these dipshits figure it out,

70
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:40,079
I will be long gone, man.

71
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:42,765
Back home in Mexico, y'know?

72
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:45,457
Yeah.

73
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,217
Hey, hey, hey, but don't worry.

74
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:49,886
You and me? We're not done.

75
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,056
We're gonna do things, big things.

76
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:56,059
"Friend of the cartel", right?

77
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,394
- Right.
- Right.

78
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:07,646
So, hey, my, um... my cousins...

79
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:08,997
they pay you?

80
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,665
Uh... yep.

81
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,593
Perfecto.

82
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,067
So make sure you buy
something nice for the wife.

83
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:16,577
Man, she's a looker, huh?

84
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:19,566
Uh, my... my what?

85
00:09:19,568 --> 00:09:22,418
Yeah! The abuela, man...
she came by to see me.

86
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,053
Hey, nice job, man.

87
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:29,171
I mean, for somebody who
marries that far up...

88
00:09:29,173 --> 00:09:31,278
bien hecho, man.

89
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,021
Respect, you know?

90
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,615
Yeah.

91
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:49,129
Let me help.

92
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,025
Here.

93
00:09:57,285 --> 00:09:58,490
Oh, my God, Jimmy.

94
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,440
You need to go to the emergency room.

95
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:01,942
I'm okay. I'm okay.

96
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:04,223
I cleaned it out real
good at the truck stop.

97
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:07,447
Alright, well, let's at least
just go get you an I.V., huh?

98
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:08,540
You're dehydrated.

99
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:09,948
No. I don't need an I.V.

100
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,791
I-I've been pounding
sports drinks nonstop.

101
00:10:12,793 --> 00:10:14,563
I'm really o-okay.

102
00:10:14,565 --> 00:10:17,873
Alright. Come on. You're
gonna get in this bath, though.

103
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,691
It'll help your skin.

104
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,058
What is this, Cream of Wheat?

105
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,817
Oatmeal. It's an oatmeal bath.

106
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,485
Anti-inflammatory.

107
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:31,588
It'll help your sunburn.

108
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:40,422
The temp okay?

109
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:43,016
Yeah. It's good.

110
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,920
You sure?

111
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:47,186
Yeah.

112
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,263
Okay.

113
00:10:48,265 --> 00:10:51,358
You don't want any food
or anything else to drink?

114
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,860
No. I'm good.

115
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,844
I just need to sit.

116
00:10:54,846 --> 00:10:57,180
This is good.

117
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,456
I can't believe you walked
through the desert alone

118
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,124
for 36 hours.

119
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:19,628
I c... I can't even fathom it.

120
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,638
That's right.

121
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,467
All by myself.

122
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,236
So...

123
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,489
is there anything you want to tell me?

124
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,678
- About... ?
- Lalo.

125
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,205
You saw Lalo?

126
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,400
Yeah.

127
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:53,145
Jimmy, short of going to the police,

128
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,664
Lalo was the only lead I had
to figure out what happened...

129
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,300
Kim, you have to stay
away from people like Lalo.

130
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,911
- Jimmy...
- You don't see Lalo.

131
00:12:01,913 --> 00:12:04,005
I see Lalo. Okay?

132
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:05,915
I'm in the game. You're not in the game.

133
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:08,268
What... The game?

134
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,742
Listen, it was perfectly safe.

135
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,934
I was at the MDC, surrounded by guards,

136
00:12:13,936 --> 00:12:15,655
like any lawyer visiting a client, okay?

137
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,519
But he's not your client.

138
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:20,920
He's my client, so
please just keep away.

139
00:12:20,922 --> 00:12:24,009
Jimmy, I was worried about you.

140
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:26,769
And I'm worried about you.

141
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,290
Kim, when I was out there...

142
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:33,293
I didn't think I was gonna make it.

143
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,537
I thought I was...

144
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:37,539
done.

145
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:42,194
I was that close to giving up.

146
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:46,548
And the only thing that kept me going...

147
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,601
was knowing that you were here.

148
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,355
So...

149
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,316
Okay.

150
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,152
I won't see Lalo again.

151
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,564
Good.

152
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:06,218
Good.

153
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:35,355
After all this...

154
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,275
was it worth it?

155
00:13:43,014 --> 00:13:45,556
Go look in the bag.

156
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:50,370
The bag in the living room.

157
00:13:54,268 --> 00:13:56,785
It's on the chair.

158
00:13:56,787 --> 00:14:00,297
It's a gray bag.

159
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,246
You see it?

160
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,326
Yeah, Jimmy.

161
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:40,829
I see it.

162
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,650
That's what it's all about.

163
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:07,107
Six guys, three vehicles, heavily armed.

164
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,506
My guess is

165
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,441
they followed the Salamanca
cousins up from Chihuahua,

166
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:12,741
trailing the money

167
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:15,174
but not wanting to
take these two guys on.

168
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:18,867
And I'm no expert, but they had tattoos,

169
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:22,020
same symbol I saw on a job back East.

170
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,522
A Colombian gang.

171
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,800
Draw it for me.

172
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:56,479
These men were hired.

173
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:59,624
By who?

174
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,843
Sí?

175
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,373
I trust you heard the good news.

176
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,024
Gustavo. Which good news is that?

177
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,509
Our colleague has been released

178
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,542
by the American authorities.

179
00:16:28,544 --> 00:16:32,682
At a substantial price, but he's free.

180
00:16:32,684 --> 00:16:35,777
And I'm told he will be returning home

181
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,537
to continue operations.

182
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:39,221
That is good news.

183
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,315
But coming south, you say?

184
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:42,434
That's correct.

185
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,702
Forfeiting bail is the only way

186
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:46,788
to assure he remains out of prison.

187
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,365
Well, then, all will
be returning to normal.

188
00:16:49,367 --> 00:16:52,868
And, I trust, your run of
bad luck will be behind you.

189
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,721
Bad luck?

190
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,539
The DEA.

191
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,966
The fire.

192
00:16:57,968 --> 00:16:59,875
The arrests.

193
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:03,288
My hope is that it's over.

194
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,748
Yes.

195
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,400
I believe the coming
weeks will be our best yet.

196
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,403
Excellent. I'll pass on the good news.

197
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,358
Buenas noches, Gustavo.

198
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,201
Thank you. Enjoy your evening.

199
00:17:20,688 --> 00:17:23,689
I just spoke to the man
responsible for the attack.

200
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,662
Someone we need to worry about?

201
00:17:27,664 --> 00:17:31,258
He was trying to protect
his own business...

202
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,668
by protecting our business.

203
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,821
If that's him trying to help...

204
00:17:36,823 --> 00:17:39,824
He knows nothing of what
we are trying to accomplish.

205
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:43,919
Once Salamanca is south of the border,

206
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:47,757
our actions must be unimpeachable.

207
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,776
Any reflection on me

208
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:53,399
will not be greeted with kindness.

209
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,020
Alright.

210
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,814
Yes?

211
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,752
There's one other
thing we should discuss.

212
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:11,856
Nacho Varga.

213
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,633
He wants out.

214
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,198
He's done everything we asked.

215
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,804
He held up his end.

216
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,365
I think it's time we cut him loose.

217
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,884
I see no reason to give up an asset.

218
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:24,969
Once Salamanca's dealt with,

219
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,704
we have no use for Varga.

220
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,313
He's the only guy they
have running things up here.

221
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:30,654
He disappears,

222
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,558
Salamanca operation falls apart.

223
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,220
Varga stays.

224
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,138
Better to control the opposition

225
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,890
without their knowledge.

226
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,412
You have a gun to his father's head.

227
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:54,232
That doesn't sit with me.

228
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,902
You want to keep Varga for the long run,

229
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:01,514
I don't think fear is a great motivator.

230
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:10,005
A dog who bites every owner he's had...

231
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:14,194
can only be disciplined
with a firm hand.

232
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,989
Or... put down.

233
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:32,286
He's taking care of business tonight.

234
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:35,715
Tomorrow morning he's
seeing Hector to say goodbye.

235
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,276
Um, after that, I drive him south.

236
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,535
He didn't tell me where.

237
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:41,462
All I know is I'm dropping him off

238
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:44,707
and somebody else is
taking him over the border.

239
00:19:44,709 --> 00:19:46,467
That it?

240
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:49,287
Yeah. Hey, um...

241
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,883
Once he's down, that's it, right?

242
00:19:53,885 --> 00:19:55,793
He's done?

243
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,970
Just do what you're told,
don't worry about it.

244
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,652
Hey.

245
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,262
Hungry?

246
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:25,156
You good with cereal?

247
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,268
Or you want me to try an omelet?

248
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:29,919
Uh, cereal,

249
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:32,680
probably the safest
thing for my stomach.

250
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,469
- Okay.
- I'll get it.

251
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:36,000
No, no, no, no, no. I got it.

252
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:39,094
Just... Just relax.

253
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:49,770
You goin' in late today?

254
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,700
Uh...

255
00:20:52,702 --> 00:20:55,587
I just thought I'd stay home today.

256
00:20:57,207 --> 00:21:00,024
Kim, I can take care of myself.

257
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,784
Well, I already called in sick,

258
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:04,620
so you're stuck with me.

259
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,051
Oh! Damn it!

260
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,557
Shit.

261
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,222
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

262
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,532
I guess my stomach's just
not ready for this yet.

263
00:21:52,837 --> 00:21:55,813
I-It's okay.

264
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,751
Not a big deal.

265
00:22:20,565 --> 00:22:23,216
Are you sure you don't
have to go into work?

266
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,460
Yeah, I'm sure. We both
need to take it easy.

267
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,221
How about a day without drama?

268
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:31,966
That sounds real good, actually.

269
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:33,634
Oh, hiya, Skinny.

270
00:22:33,636 --> 00:22:35,469
- Hello, Ruth.
- Hello, Maisie.

271
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,805
- Well, look who's here.
- Hello, Hildy.

272
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:38,881
How are you?

273
00:22:38,883 --> 00:22:40,215
Tell me... is the lord
of the universe in?

274
00:22:40,217 --> 00:22:41,884
Yes, he's in. In a bad humor.

275
00:22:41,886 --> 00:22:43,236
Somebody must have
stolen the crown jewels.

276
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:44,720
- Shall we announce you?
- Oh, no, no.

277
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:46,072
I'll blow my own horn.

278
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:48,241
He's in. Bruce, you better wait here.

279
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,225
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

280
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:53,487
Even 10 minutes is a long
time to be away from you.

281
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:56,732
- What did you say?
- Huh?

282
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,492
Well... Go on.

283
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,645
- Aww...
- Well, go ahead.

284
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:02,738
Well, I just said even 10 minutes

285
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,498
is a long time to be away from you.

286
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,484
I heard you the first time. I like it.

287
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:08,410
That's why I asked you to say it again.

288
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:10,412
I can stand being spoiled a little.

289
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:12,990
The gentleman I'm going in to
see did very little spoiling.

290
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,583
I'd like to spoil him just once.

291
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,085
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

292
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,604
Oh, no, I can handle it.

293
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:19,446
Well, if things gets rough,
remember, I'm here.

294
00:23:21,517 --> 00:23:23,759
Hi, Hildy! Welcome back!

295
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,947
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

296
00:23:29,934 --> 00:23:31,266
I'm... I'm sorry.

297
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:33,901
No, today... uh, it's impossible today.

298
00:23:33,903 --> 00:23:36,168
I-I can't help you.

299
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,497
Yeah, that's right.

300
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:43,296
A little more around the chin, boss.

301
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,949
Uh, w-wait. What are they saying?

302
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:51,545
Uh, y... Just wait 45
minutes. I-I-I can be there.

303
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:54,732
- What? Jimmy, no.
- Yeah, you tell them I'm on my way.

304
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,534
So, how's the big slot-machine king?

305
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,311
- Oh, I ain't doing that no more.
- Jim... Jimmy.

306
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,761
- You can barely walk.
- What are you doing?

307
00:24:00,763 --> 00:24:03,541
It's my client. He's in big trouble.

308
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,210
They're trying to kill his plea deal

309
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,212
because his buddy was carrying weed.

310
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:09,471
Well, okay.

311
00:24:09,473 --> 00:24:10,731
So get a continuance.

312
00:24:10,733 --> 00:24:12,158
You don't have to do this today.

313
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,016
No, this guy's scared out of his mind.

314
00:24:14,018 --> 00:24:16,570
I-I wouldn't feel right
leaving him hanging.

315
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:21,125
Jimmy, look, I know you're lying.

316
00:24:24,822 --> 00:24:29,027
And I know something terrible
happened in the desert.

317
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,828
This isn't about our deal.

318
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,072
I'm not insisting or
forcing you to tell me.

319
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,407
I just...

320
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:40,335
want you to know that I'm here...

321
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:42,814
for you.

322
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:50,530
And you can tell me, okay?

323
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,824
No judgments.

324
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,830
No judgments.

325
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,103
You're right.

326
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:09,215
Something did happen out there.

327
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,723
When I was in the desert...

328
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:20,930
I had to drink my own pee.

329
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,879
I was out of water,

330
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:28,383
and, uh, in order to
survive, I had to drink pee.

331
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:33,131
Yeah, that's it, so...

332
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,649
And there you go.

333
00:25:35,651 --> 00:25:37,301
Look...

334
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,819
I will recover,

335
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,896
and we never need to mention this again.

336
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:44,876
I'm gonna go get changed,
and I'm gonna get down there.

337
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:02,602
Kim.

338
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,743
- Feeling better?
- Oh, yeah.

339
00:26:04,745 --> 00:26:06,606
Just a 24-hour thing. It passed.

340
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,090
Besides, I thought I should come in

341
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:09,683
and prep the Colorado meeting.

342
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,019
Oh, they moved that up to
this morning. Stef handled it.

343
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,596
There was no pushback
from Boulder city council?

344
00:26:14,598 --> 00:26:16,755
Stef cleared up the
conditional use issue.

345
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:18,464
Everything's moving forward.

346
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:21,695
Wow. That's great.

347
00:26:21,697 --> 00:26:23,080
Great.

348
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:27,426
Well, uh...

349
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:28,628
Okay.

350
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,810
You wanted to write letters

351
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:31,872
to the planning board in Broomfield.

352
00:26:31,874 --> 00:26:34,358
Right. Yes, that's right.

353
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,193
I'll get started on that,

354
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,742
if you can just get me those names.

355
00:26:37,744 --> 00:26:39,525
List is on your desk.

356
00:26:39,527 --> 00:26:41,367
Of course. Great.

357
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:48,372
First letter is for Mr. Armand Bekaris,

358
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:50,891
Chairman of the Planning
and Zoning Commission,

359
00:26:50,893 --> 00:26:53,727
and, uh, let's just c.c. the Vice Chair,

360
00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:56,585
Elaine Perlman while we're at it.

361
00:26:56,587 --> 00:26:59,128
"Dear Mr. Bekaris.

362
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,143
Mesa Verde Bank and
Trust respectfully submit

363
00:27:01,145 --> 00:27:04,388
the following request
for your consideration.

364
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:12,329
In regards to the resolution
number PZ 2004-dash-36

365
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,507
Variance appeal to allow for

366
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,714
a six-and-one-half-foot
encroachment into the...

367
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:25,036
Into the minimum
required rear setback...

368
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:35,271
Um, minimum required rear setback

369
00:27:35,273 --> 00:27:39,991
for a drive-through awning to allow..."

370
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:41,016
Strike that.

371
00:27:41,018 --> 00:27:44,251
"To facilitate...

372
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:46,780
access to...

373
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:49,358
the property at..."

374
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,545
"... 841 North".

375
00:27:54,031 --> 00:27:56,273
So, can you call his assistant

376
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,442
and get some intel on
what he's into right now?

377
00:27:58,444 --> 00:27:59,793
Kim.

378
00:27:59,795 --> 00:28:01,946
They told me you were out sick today.

379
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,280
Yeah, no.

380
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:06,208
I, uh... Rich, you free to talk?

381
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,119
Yeah. Is everything okay?

382
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,386
Yeah.

383
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:10,879
I just need a minute.

384
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:12,732
Okay. Mm.

385
00:28:17,388 --> 00:28:19,572
So, what's up?

386
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:23,317
I, uh... I know this
is going to sound...

387
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,899
What?

388
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:34,378
I'm sorry that I can't
give you more notice...

389
00:28:47,608 --> 00:28:50,157
Marcie, uh, can you do me a favor?

390
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,604
Copy all the pro bono files

391
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:53,180
and send the originals to my place.

392
00:28:53,182 --> 00:28:54,412
Also, it's no rush,

393
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:57,014
but box up my diplomas
and photos, please.

394
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:59,022
Are... we moving offices?

395
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,595
I don't want you to worry.
I talked to Rich.

396
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:02,281
You'll be reassigned to another partner.

397
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:03,765
Wait. Reassigned?

398
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:06,435
Oh, and they're gonna want these.

399
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,956
I'm parked in my usual spot.

400
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,683
If I left anything else in there,

401
00:29:12,685 --> 00:29:15,086
just put it in the box.

402
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:19,131
Thank you, Marcie.

403
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:21,450
- Good luck.
- Kim?

404
00:30:52,113 --> 00:30:54,212
Hi there.

405
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:56,453
We're bringing birthday
cake out for Louise,

406
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,712
one of our residents.

407
00:30:57,714 --> 00:30:59,037
Everyone's going to sing.

408
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,308
Hector really doesn't
like to miss these.

409
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,643
Yeah.

410
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:06,146
Could you give us a minute, please?

411
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,326
Okay, guys.

412
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:40,922
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

413
00:31:40,924 --> 00:31:45,260
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

414
00:31:45,262 --> 00:31:49,648
♪ Happy birthday, dear Louise ♪

415
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,102
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

416
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:19,457
Where to?

417
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:23,011
Go. The border.

418
00:32:48,992 --> 00:32:50,734
Hey.

419
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,495
That was something
what happened in there.

420
00:32:53,497 --> 00:32:54,895
Hey, look, don't feel bad.

421
00:32:54,897 --> 00:32:57,732
You can't win 'em all.
But that one? Jeesh!

422
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,659
I thought for sure I was gonna lose.

423
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:01,929
There wasn't a chance in hell
I was supposed to win that one.

424
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:03,597
But there you were.

425
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,175
Snatching defeat from
the jaws of victory.

426
00:33:07,177 --> 00:33:09,083
Ball in your hand,

427
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:11,954
at the goal line, fumble!

428
00:33:11,956 --> 00:33:14,796
Law students are gonna
review the "Goodman Debacle"

429
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,852
as a teachable moment, so
at least there's that.

430
00:33:17,854 --> 00:33:20,931
No, think of all the kids you'll
help learn "what not to do"

431
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:22,857
when faced with underwhelming odds.

432
00:33:22,859 --> 00:33:24,451
So embarrassing.

433
00:33:24,453 --> 00:33:27,019
You'll probably have to
change your name... again.

434
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:39,616
Hey, just so you know,

435
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:41,376
I don't think any less of you.

436
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:44,379
You're still, uh... a lawyer.

437
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:23,052
You can start talking any time.

438
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,421
You said this goes away.

439
00:34:26,423 --> 00:34:29,400
So, what's the timeframe on that?

440
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,838
It's different for different people,

441
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,023
I suppose.

442
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:37,674
For me.

443
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,828
When will this be over for me?

444
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:45,349
Well, here's what's gonna happen.

445
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:47,076
One day...

446
00:34:47,078 --> 00:34:50,954
one day you're gonna wake
up, eat your breakfast,

447
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:54,791
brush your teeth, go
about your business.

448
00:34:56,045 --> 00:34:58,286
And sooner or later,

449
00:34:58,288 --> 00:35:02,493
you're gonna realize you
haven't thought about it.

450
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,478
None of it.

451
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:10,482
And that's the moment.

452
00:35:10,484 --> 00:35:13,802
You realize you can forget.

453
00:35:13,804 --> 00:35:15,970
When you know that's possible,

454
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:17,305
it all gets easier.

455
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:19,042
But what about you?

456
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:22,043
Like, what happened out
there doesn't bother you?

457
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,647
Them wanting to steal the $7 million

458
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:27,315
didn't work for me.

459
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:30,336
Not to mention they wanted
to shoot you in the head.

460
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,821
It was them, or it was us.

461
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:34,048
Cut and dried.

462
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:38,093
They were in the game.

463
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:44,591
What about Fred?

464
00:35:44,593 --> 00:35:47,077
From Travel Wire.

465
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,688
Was he in the game?

466
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,359
No.

467
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:56,862
There was a lot wrong
with what happened there.

468
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,347
Yeah. Lalo.

469
00:35:59,349 --> 00:36:01,516
Lalo killed that guy.

470
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,369
And for what?

471
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:06,705
He killed that guy,
and we're helping him.

472
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:13,361
All this shit just to...

473
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:17,532
so he can get out of
jail and just get away?

474
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,536
It's not the end of the story.

475
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,359
Wait a minute.

476
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:26,374
What does that mean, uh,
"not the end of the story"?

477
00:36:26,376 --> 00:36:27,607
What... What are you saying?

478
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:29,544
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

479
00:36:29,546 --> 00:36:31,121
Is something gonna happen to Lalo?

480
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:33,580
I didn't say that.

481
00:36:33,582 --> 00:36:35,047
Aw, Jesus.

482
00:36:35,049 --> 00:36:37,961
What have I gotten
myself involved with here?

483
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,798
Look, just tell me. What
are you saying is gonna...

484
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,799
Look.

485
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:46,578
We all make our choices.

486
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,973
And those choices...
they put us on a road.

487
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,433
Sometimes those choices seem small,

488
00:36:52,435 --> 00:36:55,125
but they put you on the road.

489
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:57,762
You think about getting off.

490
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,910
But eventually you're back on it.

491
00:37:01,912 --> 00:37:04,930
And the road we're on
led us out to the desert

492
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:06,823
and everything that happened there

493
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:11,030
and straight back to
where we are right now.

494
00:37:12,181 --> 00:37:14,589
And nothing...

495
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:17,776
nothing can be done about that.

496
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,364
Do you understand that?

497
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:28,345
I can't believe...

498
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:32,199
I can't believe there's, like,

499
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:34,851
over a billion people on this planet

500
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,797
and the only person I have
to talk about this to is you.

501
00:39:08,447 --> 00:39:11,223
You want me to wait?

502
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:14,136
Nah. They'll be here.

503
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:16,664
Really. Go.

504
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:19,623
You sure?

505
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,308
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,051
Look, I'll be in touch, man.

507
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:25,404
Hey, that fire you did at Fring's...

508
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:28,222
that was good work, man.

509
00:39:28,224 --> 00:39:29,800
We're gonna do more.

510
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,205
Sounds good.

511
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,606
Take me back up the road.

512
00:40:00,608 --> 00:40:03,333
Slow.

513
00:40:06,096 --> 00:40:08,505
- What for?
- Just do it.

514
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:11,508
Six or seven miles back.

515
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:27,024
What are we looking for?

516
00:40:27,026 --> 00:40:30,527
Lawyer said his car broke down.

517
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,698
Six miles from the pick-up.

518
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,308
Where is it?

519
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:44,541
Ohh, let me out here. Let me out here.

520
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,542
Come.

521
00:42:01,544 --> 00:42:04,120
Back to Albuquerque.

522
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,217
What about Marco and Leonel?

523
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:10,350
What about them?

524
00:42:10,352 --> 00:42:12,720
I'll get them a message. Let's go.

525
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:00,160
Jimmy?

526
00:43:01,513 --> 00:43:04,030
You okay?

527
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,278
Yeah, what time is it?

528
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,281
It's 6:30.

529
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:15,358
I'm sorry.

530
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,118
You want to go back to sleep?

531
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,363
No. I-I'm up.

532
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:24,701
You can still go to a doctor, you know.

533
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:26,645
No harm in getting checked out.

534
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,814
I'm fine.

535
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:32,542
I, uh, think I just need food.

536
00:43:32,544 --> 00:43:35,378
I haven't eaten since, um...

537
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:39,140
well, really before everything.

538
00:43:39,142 --> 00:43:40,717
Okay.

539
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,496
Maybe go easy, just some soup at first.

540
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:46,723
I'm okay, Kim, really.

541
00:43:46,725 --> 00:43:49,150
I know.

542
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:50,972
Good.

543
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:53,487
Good.

544
00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:54,914
What about you?

545
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:57,171
You seem, uh...

546
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,569
worried, maybe?

547
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:01,087
No, no, no.

548
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:02,755
It's just...

549
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:05,684
I have news, but it can wait.

550
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,577
Let's get some food in you first.

551
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,836
What news?

552
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,172
What kind of news?

553
00:44:11,174 --> 00:44:13,583
Nothing bad.

554
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:17,720
So, tha... that means it's good news?

555
00:44:18,773 --> 00:44:21,941
Yeah. I think so.

556
00:44:21,943 --> 00:44:24,494
Great. Lemme hear it.

557
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:30,950
I, uh...

558
00:44:30,952 --> 00:44:34,504
quit Schweikart and Cokely.

559
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:39,509
And I gave up Mesa Verde.

560
00:44:41,613 --> 00:44:44,431
How 'bout we get some food together?

561
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,708
Wait.

562
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,060
What happened?

563
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:51,035
Did somebody say something
about what we did?

564
00:44:51,037 --> 00:44:52,392
- No, no.
- Was it Rich?

565
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:53,957
Nobody said anything.

566
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:56,568
Uh... It just... It... It felt right.

567
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,145
- It felt right? What... How?
- I...

568
00:44:59,147 --> 00:45:01,222
I-I just...

569
00:45:01,224 --> 00:45:04,984
I keep pushing Mesa Verde
away to do my pro bono work,

570
00:45:04,986 --> 00:45:07,987
and then when you were gone,

571
00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:09,639
I didn't know what happened.

572
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:10,898
I mean, I...

573
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,643
I thought you were dead.

574
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:15,145
So...

575
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,480
that was, um...

576
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:21,760
all of it helped me to see
what's important and what isn't.

577
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:26,322
So you're just gonna throw it all away?

578
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,600
I mean, you busted
your ass for all of it.

579
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:30,401
I'm not throwing it away.

580
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:33,329
I did S&C. I did Mesa Verde.

581
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,165
I-I achieved that.

582
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,168
I had that experience, but...

583
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,837
it doesn't make me happy.

584
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,264
Look, it's been a rough couple of days,

585
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:46,081
so why don't you just hold
off on a final decision?

586
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,361
Call Rich. Tell him
you're thinking it over.

587
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:49,921
I already talked to Rich.

588
00:45:49,923 --> 00:45:51,197
And I called Paige.

589
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:53,850
We had a nice, very long conversation.

590
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,293
It's done.

591
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,795
Then I spent the afternoon
at the courthouse

592
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:57,959
with pro bono clients

593
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,984
without Mesa Verde hanging over my head.

594
00:45:59,986 --> 00:46:02,101
Best afternoon I've had in a long time.

595
00:46:02,103 --> 00:46:04,093
Alright, "pro bono" is wonderful.

596
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,046
It is, but "pro bono" means no money.

597
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:09,273
So, what's the plan here?

598
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:12,293
I don't know. But I'll figure it out.

599
00:46:12,295 --> 00:46:14,015
Okay.

600
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:15,891
Leaving Schweikart... I get that.

601
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:17,056
It's a bunch of stuffed shirts.

602
00:46:17,058 --> 00:46:18,708
But, uh, Mesa Verde?

603
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,543
Hey, that's like leaving the Yankees

604
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:22,931
to play amateur ring toss.

605
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:23,996
No, it's not.

606
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:26,419
I'm... I'm leaving something that makes

607
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:27,975
zero difference in the world

608
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:30,553
to help people who are actually in need.

609
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:33,072
This is a bad idea.

610
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,058
What?

611
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,836
Look, we all make choices, right?

612
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:40,897
And those choices...
they put us on a road.

613
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,340
And the road has good choices,

614
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:43,808
and it has bad choices.

615
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,679
And this is a bad choice road.

616
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:49,422
- What are you even talking about?
- I'm...

617
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,726
... saying that bad
choices lead to bad roads

618
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,895
that lead to bad places.

619
00:46:57,024 --> 00:47:00,341
When you decided to be "Saul Goodman",

620
00:47:00,343 --> 00:47:03,409
I didn't get it, still don't, really,

621
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:05,194
but I stood by your decision.

622
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:06,960
And I'm not changing my identity.

623
00:47:06,962 --> 00:47:08,107
I'm just leaving a job.

624
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,276
What I did was completely different!

625
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:12,935
- How?
- 'Cause I was leaving failure for success!

626
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:14,129
It's not different.

627
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,357
You believed it was right for you.

628
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:17,542
Give me the courtesy

629
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:19,033
of believing this is right for me.

630
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:21,048
And I'm giving you a reality check.

631
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:22,863
This is too far, too fast.

632
00:47:22,865 --> 00:47:24,572
And I'm giving you a reality check.

633
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,610
This is really none
of your damn business.

634
00:47:36,396 --> 00:47:37,896
Yeah?

635
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,305
Listen to me.

636
00:47:39,307 --> 00:47:40,714
Put your phone down.

637
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,567
Leave it on so I can hear.

638
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:44,250
So you can hear? Hear what?

639
00:47:44,252 --> 00:47:46,959
Do what I said right now.

640
00:47:46,961 --> 00:47:50,847
Put it down, somewhere it can't be seen.

641
00:47:52,612 --> 00:47:54,871
Jimmy.

642
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:10,895
Hey, guys!

643
00:48:10,897 --> 00:48:13,765
I come in?

644
00:48:14,884 --> 00:48:16,342
Lalo.

645
00:48:16,344 --> 00:48:19,920
Thought you'd be down South,

646
00:48:19,922 --> 00:48:21,589
enjoying your freedom.

647
00:48:21,591 --> 00:48:24,075
Yeah, well...

648
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,945
had some business to attend to.

649
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:29,355
Told you he'd be back.

650
00:48:29,357 --> 00:48:32,433
Nice! I like it.

651
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:35,678
Hey, look, you want a drink?

652
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,697
Uh, we got some beer in the fridge.

653
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:40,199
Unless you're not staying that...

654
00:48:41,611 --> 00:48:44,521
You shouldn't... I'm sorry. Um...

655
00:48:44,523 --> 00:48:46,372
Sorry.

656
00:48:46,374 --> 00:48:48,374
Y-You shouldn't, uh, do that.

657
00:48:48,376 --> 00:48:51,094
It upsets the fish.

658
00:49:07,729 --> 00:49:10,989
Look, you want to talk, we can talk,

659
00:49:10,991 --> 00:49:13,716
but, uh, Kim was just
stepping out, so...

660
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,386
Nah. She can stay.

661
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:20,593
I mean, she is part of
the "legal team", right?

662
00:49:22,323 --> 00:49:24,012
Hey, relax.

663
00:49:24,014 --> 00:49:25,564
Sit down. We're just gonna talk.

664
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:28,565
C'mon.

665
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:31,217
Sit!

666
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,638
Okay.

667
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:45,598
So...

668
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,509
Tell me what happened.

669
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:50,920
What happened?

670
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:54,774
Yeah, when, uh... when
you picked up the money.

671
00:49:54,776 --> 00:49:58,578
Just... walk me through it.

672
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:02,523
What I told you already?

673
00:50:02,525 --> 00:50:05,335
Yes.

674
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,621
Fine.

675
00:50:08,623 --> 00:50:11,365
Uh, I-I picked up the
money from your cousins.

676
00:50:11,367 --> 00:50:14,509
It was right where you
told me it would be.

677
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,944
Driving back, my car crapped out

678
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:21,896
about six or seven miles
from the pick-up site.

679
00:50:21,898 --> 00:50:24,421
There's no phone service,

680
00:50:24,423 --> 00:50:28,549
so I walked north through
the desert all night.

681
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:31,402
Well, I slept a little,
but then in the morning,

682
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:35,122
I walked again until I
made it to a truck stop.

683
00:50:35,124 --> 00:50:37,558
I went into the bathroom and cleaned up.

684
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,579
I bought some clothes,
and I... I called a cab.

685
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:43,278
I delivered the money.

686
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,127
Took 'em a couple hours to
count it, usual rigmarole,

687
00:50:47,129 --> 00:50:49,188
and then I... then I saw you.

688
00:50:57,747 --> 00:51:00,306
Tell me again.

689
00:51:01,255 --> 00:51:02,627
What?

690
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:07,421
Tell. Me. Again.

691
00:51:17,951 --> 00:51:21,010
I picked up the money

692
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:25,439
from those two, uh, fine gentlemen.

693
00:51:25,441 --> 00:51:26,891
My car broke down

694
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:29,702
after about, well, just 10 minutes.

695
00:51:29,704 --> 00:51:32,112
There was no phone service,

696
00:51:32,114 --> 00:51:34,023
and I was afraid to hitchhike

697
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:37,543
'cause of how much money it was.

698
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:40,621
And, uh, I ran out of water.

699
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:43,791
So I had to drink my own pee.

700
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:45,793
- Ugh!
- A lot of it.

701
00:51:45,795 --> 00:51:47,720
So, you wanted details, there you go.

702
00:51:47,722 --> 00:51:52,041
And then I, uh, finally
made it to a truck stop,

703
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:54,210
I called a cab.

704
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,434
And I waited,

705
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:57,655
and then he took me
directly to the courthouse.

706
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,640
I paid your bail, and I gotchu out.

707
00:51:59,642 --> 00:52:02,885
I'm... I'm not sure what
you're looking for here,

708
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:05,905
but there... there you go.

709
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:12,152
I just want to hear the story.

710
00:52:14,156 --> 00:52:16,415
Lalo, this is exactly what he told me,

711
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:19,085
- so if you could just...
- Shh.

712
00:52:21,255 --> 00:52:24,648
I just like to hear the story.

713
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,834
I mean...

714
00:52:26,836 --> 00:52:30,003
I paid a lot of money for that story.

715
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:33,766
So I think I can hear
it as much as I want.

716
00:52:43,595 --> 00:52:47,171
So...

717
00:52:47,173 --> 00:52:50,190
tell me again.

718
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:57,181
I picked up two big bags of money.

719
00:52:57,183 --> 00:53:00,610
$7 million.

720
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:04,722
Two heavy, heavy bags
that you paid me to get.

721
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:08,893
I put 'em in the trunk of my car.

722
00:53:08,895 --> 00:53:13,046
Then about, uh, 10 minutes later,

723
00:53:13,048 --> 00:53:15,048
my car's engine went.

724
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,476
Um, I tried to fix it,

725
00:53:17,478 --> 00:53:19,386
but it was overheated or something.

726
00:53:19,388 --> 00:53:22,890
So I walked north through the desert.

727
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:25,076
I walked and I walked and I walked

728
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:28,137
with those heavy, heavy bags.

729
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:30,748
I walked and I walked and I walked

730
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,826
and I finally made it to a truck stop.

731
00:53:33,828 --> 00:53:35,494
And I went right to the bathroom

732
00:53:35,496 --> 00:53:37,997
and I stuck my head under the faucet

733
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:40,983
and I bought a giant
pack of energy drinks.

734
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:44,745
And I called a taxi, and I waited.

735
00:53:44,747 --> 00:53:47,323
I don't know what the problem is,

736
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:51,844
but can she leave here?

737
00:53:51,846 --> 00:53:53,904
She doesn't need to be here.

738
00:53:53,906 --> 00:53:55,599
She had nothing to do with it.

739
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:56,941
It was me.

740
00:53:56,943 --> 00:53:58,592
It was all me.

741
00:53:58,594 --> 00:54:01,058
It was all you, huh?

742
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:03,750
Yeah.

743
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:08,769
What'd you do, Saul, hmm?

744
00:54:08,771 --> 00:54:12,406
Whatever you think I did,

745
00:54:12,408 --> 00:54:14,405
I don't really know.
I just... She just...

746
00:54:14,407 --> 00:54:16,276
I saw your car.

747
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,088
Okay?

748
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:21,540
You push it in a ditch?

749
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:23,025
I, what?

750
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:26,045
Did you push it in a ditch?

751
00:54:27,974 --> 00:54:30,382
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?!

752
00:54:30,384 --> 00:54:33,202
Well, I mean, you
either did or you didn't.

753
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:36,038
So, um, which one is it?

754
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:40,728
I don't know what you want.

755
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:42,044
Do you want the money back?

756
00:54:42,046 --> 00:54:44,972
'Cause it's... it's in a bag in
the other room. You can take it.

757
00:54:44,974 --> 00:54:46,807
I just want what happened.

758
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:48,809
I-I told you what happened.

759
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:50,143
Did you?

760
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,505
Look, okay, I...

761
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:55,545
Geez. Are you... Are
you kidding me with this?

762
00:54:55,547 --> 00:54:56,575
Kim, really...

763
00:54:56,577 --> 00:54:58,636
Do you know what he did for you?

764
00:54:58,638 --> 00:55:00,919
$7 million of your money.

765
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:03,007
He hauled it across a goddamn desert

766
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:04,750
without one penny missing.

767
00:55:04,752 --> 00:55:07,494
And he got you out of
jail for a murder that,

768
00:55:07,496 --> 00:55:09,997
let's face it, you're
definitely guilty of.

769
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:11,924
He did everything you asked

770
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:15,072
and went way beyond what any
other lawyer would ever do.

771
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:18,839
So what, exactly, is it
that you're getting at?

772
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:20,841
What do you want?

773
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:27,590
I found his car in a ravine.

774
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:30,609
Bullet holes on the side.

775
00:55:30,611 --> 00:55:32,336
So...

776
00:55:32,338 --> 00:55:35,264
I'm just waiting to
hear how that happened.

777
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:41,546
Bullet holes.

778
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:44,106
That's it?

779
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:47,937
Look, I don't know what
it's like where you're from,

780
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:51,046
but here in New Mexico,
you leave a soda can out,

781
00:55:51,048 --> 00:55:52,464
someone's taking a shot at it.

782
00:55:52,466 --> 00:55:55,025
That... That... That's
what you're on about?

783
00:55:55,027 --> 00:55:57,619
You don't think it's possible
a couple of yahoos with guns

784
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,455
shot up a piece-of-junk car,

785
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:03,367
then rolled it down in
a ditch, end of story?

786
00:56:03,369 --> 00:56:07,296
What kind of operation
are you running, anyway?

787
00:56:07,298 --> 00:56:08,739
Tell me.

788
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:12,577
'Cause I think I know why
you sent him to do this job.

789
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:14,061
It's obvious.

790
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:17,489
You have no one else you can trust.

791
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:19,308
Right?

792
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:22,903
So you sent some lawyer
through the desert with your...

793
00:56:22,905 --> 00:56:24,730
with your 7 million bucks?

794
00:56:24,732 --> 00:56:26,424
That... I... No offense,

795
00:56:26,426 --> 00:56:29,743
but you need to get your house in order.

796
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:31,754
Really?

797
00:56:31,756 --> 00:56:33,155
Yeah, really.

798
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:36,175
If you don't trust your
men with your money,

799
00:56:36,177 --> 00:56:39,252
you have bigger problems than
if you trust Saul Goodman.

800
00:56:40,681 --> 00:56:43,849
And for the record, he doesn't lie,

801
00:56:43,851 --> 00:56:46,611
not to me, not to his clients.

802
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:49,188
He's telling you the truth.

803
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,932
But next time you have a bunch of money

804
00:56:51,934 --> 00:56:53,784
and no one you can trust,

805
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:55,845
leave him out of it, okay?

806
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,875
Try a... a wire transfer.

807
00:56:57,877 --> 00:57:00,635
Try a... a shell company or... or...

808
00:57:00,637 --> 00:57:03,059
You've heard of the Cayman
Islands, right? Jesus.

809
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:07,269
Get your shit together and
stop torturing the one man

810
00:57:07,271 --> 00:57:10,709
who went through hell to save your ass.

811
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:30,339
What now?

812
00:58:32,034 --> 00:58:35,177
Mexíco.

813
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:39,965
Back to the same place?

814
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:43,352
No. Change of plans.

815
00:58:46,474 --> 00:58:50,050
Come on, Ignacio. Go.

816
00:58:50,052 --> 00:58:54,129
We got a long way ahead of us.
