1
00:00:00,378 --> 00:00:02,782
For those of you
who were too fucking busy,

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,068
this is what happened
last week on <i>Shameless:</i>

3
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:06,759
Hey, you filthy fucking Portuguese.
<i>Stan's losing his marbles.</i>

4
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:09,185
What happened?
I know you fucked my sister!

5
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:11,281
<i>You're right, he shouldn't</i>
<i>be left alone up there.</i>

6
00:00:11,316 --> 00:00:13,116
Call his daughter. I'm gonna come down
there and I'm gonna kick your ass!

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,680
He wants to stay
in his apartment.

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,351
Where the hell've you been?
Brazil.

9
00:00:16,386 --> 00:00:18,352
We should get together, have
lunch, just to catch up.

10
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,684
<i>I'm seeing someone.</i> <i>So am I.
Bring him.</i> <i>A double date.</i>

11
00:00:20,718 --> 00:00:21,750
Estefania doesn't really
speak English.

12
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:23,516
You're married?
Ah, <i>si!</i>

13
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,953
You married a drug lord's
daughter, to hang onto your ear?

14
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:27,655
I missed you.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,726
Hey!
Okay.

16
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,563
Whoa.

17
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:36,896
- <i>Was it weird seeing Jimmy?
- Who's Jimmy?</i>

18
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,165
Jimmy is Steve.

19
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,168
V, they're gone.
Ethel and Jonah.

20
00:00:40,202 --> 00:00:41,637
<i>All their stuff is gone.</i>

21
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,371
<i>His clothes,</i>
<i>her suitcase, gone.</i>

22
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:44,805
Fuck you, Lip!

23
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,139
I'll make West Point on my own.
I don't need you.

24
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,308
She's a married mother,
publicly flaunting

25
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,708
the geriatric
she's sleeping with.

26
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,508
<i>Come on, I need an accomplice.</i>

27
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,876
When I tell Hal we're going out
for a girls' night,

28
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:54,878
then I won't be lying.

29
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:56,245
I'm sorry, who are you?

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,712
I'm your grandmother,
sweetheart.

31
00:00:57,746 --> 00:00:59,713
Grammy showed up.
Grammy's back.

32
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:02,115
Jesus...
They let you out?

33
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,316
Surprised to see you, Peg.

34
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,016
Thought you were
doing 20 to life.

35
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,617
I will fuck you up!

36
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,451
Oh my God, there's a woman...

37
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:09,319
Shit. Shit!
<i>...with a gun.</i>

38
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,953
She's at a party,
she's shooting people!

39
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,586
Go ahead and pull it!

40
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:15,388
Do it! Do it!

41
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,022
...and I'm gonna kick your ass.

42
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,189
Put some pants on, man.
I got pants on.

Come on, you know I hate that.

66
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:49,864
I'm going to stick my thumb in
your butt if you don't stop.

67
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,132
Mm.

68
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:53,868
Now we're talking.

69
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,303
Morning, sunshine.

70
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:58,172
Who let you in?
Carl.

71
00:02:58,207 --> 00:03:01,309
We don't let people
in the house before I wake up!

72
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:03,744
Which guy doesn't like
a finger up the butt?

73
00:03:03,778 --> 00:03:05,345
What are you doing here?

74
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,547
I came to invite you out
in David's boat today.

75
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,215
I thought you weren't
allowed on the boat.

76
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:10,482
Isn't it the wife's?

77
00:03:10,517 --> 00:03:11,917
Yeah, but they're in Indiana.

78
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:13,552
Dropping one of the brats
off at college.

79
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,390
Steve's back in town.
Not sure what to do about it.

80
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,224
Bring him.
Boat's got a Jacuzzi.

81
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:24,026
Nah. Kids start school Tuesday.
I got a lot to do to get ready.

82
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,329
So, come for an hour!

83
00:03:26,363 --> 00:03:28,264
Everybody says that,
but it never happens.

84
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:29,865
I'll kick you out
after an hour, then.

85
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,901
Shouldn't you be getting your
kids ready for school, too?

86
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:34,002
Hal's on it.
He loves doing that crap.

87
00:03:34,037 --> 00:03:35,237
So you'll come?

88
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,905
I'll think about it.

89
00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:39,273
I gotta take a shower now,
wash your slobber off me.

90
00:03:39,308 --> 00:03:41,509
You know, men pay lots
of money for that slobber.

91
00:03:41,543 --> 00:03:43,911
Oh, yeah.
Thanks for the visual.

92
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:46,447
Mm. Go make yourself useful.
I need coffee.

93
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:49,916
You look like shit, Frank.
You just getting in?

94
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,418
Just got up.
It's 7:00 a.m.

95
00:03:52,453 --> 00:03:54,921
Hurry up in there. I gotta
help my mother out of bed

96
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,122
and take her to the bathroom.
Really putting a damper

97
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,590
on your drink, puke,
sleep schedule, huh?

98
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,758
I can't take it anymore.

99
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,726
Your problem. Not ours.

100
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:08,065
What about this little guy?

101
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,467
Hey, fella!

102
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:11,936
Ah, I don't know, V.

103
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,638
Oh, come on, he's so cute.

104
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:15,739
How could anyone
have abandoned him?

105
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:17,074
And his tongue is almost
as good as yours.

106
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:18,943
A dog is not going to

107
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,779
fill the hole in my heart.

108
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,447
When you going to
get over this, Kev?

109
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,215
Doesn't it bother you
that Ethel's gone?

110
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,783
It bothers me we're not gonna
get the money anymore.

111
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:28,451
How could she just
leave us like that?

112
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:29,719
Because she's
an ungrateful bitch.

113
00:04:29,753 --> 00:04:31,154
All right, stop.
I'm serious.

114
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,488
If she doesn't give
a shit about us,

115
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,756
why should we
give a shit about her?

116
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,624
She was family.

117
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,426
Well, we have to move on.

118
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,060
I liked having someone
depending on me.

119
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,128
Well, then pick out
a stupid dog!

120
00:04:41,163 --> 00:04:42,563
Dogs are too much
responsibility.

121
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,832
A kid isn't?
A cat, then.

122
00:04:44,866 --> 00:04:46,567
It's gonna piss everywhere.

123
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,835
Well... we're not leaving
here without something.

124
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:51,405
Fine.

125
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,807
We'll get that.

126
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:01,149
This baby's pushing
on my bladder.

00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:02,984

129
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,754
Not again.

130
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:08,957
Knowing you were peeing
made me horny.

131
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,759
You're a sex addict.

132
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:14,463

00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:19,659
Can't.

159
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,194
Got a big day planned.

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:22,696
Where?

161
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,431
At the Alibi?

162
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:27,534
We can go after you take
me to Indian Bingo.

163
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,369
Was thinking...

164
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:32,339
we should look for a new place
for you to live today.

165
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:34,675
Why the hell
would I want to do that?

166
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:36,343
Be a lot more comfortable.

167
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:38,112
Walk-in tub.

168
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,348
One of those
chair-stair things.

169
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:41,884
A ramp on the front porch.

170
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,553
You'd be a lot more
independent.

171
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,955
Don't need it;
I have you.

172
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,692
Well, I can't always be here.

173
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,860
Got a full-time job,
six kids to raise.

174
00:06:51,895 --> 00:06:54,864
Are we talking
about the same person?

175
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:56,698
Scrub harder.

176
00:06:56,733 --> 00:07:00,235
You're scrubbing like a pussy.

177
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,206
Disturbing image.

178
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
Morning, Lip.

179
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:07,276
How's it going, Grams?

180
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:11,448
You fuck girls
with that pecker?

181
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,751
As often as they let me.

182
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,253
Hard to believe he got Karen
pregnant with that thing.

183
00:07:16,288 --> 00:07:19,290
It's so small, isn't it?

184
00:07:19,324 --> 00:07:21,426
Don't kiss up to me
because you feel

185
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:23,295
like a worthless piece of shit.

186
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:27,432
Missed a spot, Frank.

187
00:07:28,768 --> 00:07:30,902
Ass fuck.
Jack off.

188
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,424
You guys still not talking?

189
00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:53,327
Dude?!
Carl?!

190
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,695
What the fuck?

191
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,130
Holy crap, why have I
never done that before?

192
00:07:56,164 --> 00:07:57,832
You have too much
time on your hands.

193
00:07:57,866 --> 00:07:59,100
Summer school next year.

194
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,635
How's your head?

195
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,671
Little dizzy.
You're fine.

196
00:08:02,705 --> 00:08:04,039
Go have some breakfast.

197
00:08:04,073 --> 00:08:05,507
How much we looking at
in the winter-squirrel fund?

198
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,609
Just over nine grand.
That's all we made

199
00:08:07,644 --> 00:08:08,944
to get us through
the entire winter?

200
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:11,046
Frank screwed us
when he gave Liam away.

201
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,947
And there was that new
compressor for the fridge.

202
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:14,982
And that stuff for Liam's
ear infection, mwah!

203
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,517
Everyone needs
to get winter jobs.

204
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,784
Debs, get down here.

205
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,019
Breakfast.

206
00:08:19,053 --> 00:08:20,287
I'll be right there.

207
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:26,727
I'll use the downstairs toilet.

208
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:28,863
School supplies and clothing,
nothing else.

209
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,699
No candy, drugs, beer,
or concert tickets.

210
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,000
And I want receipts.

211
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:34,302
What if the drugs
are really good?

212
00:08:34,337 --> 00:08:35,337
You're still here?

213
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,172
I got caught up
reading a magazine.

214
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:38,474
Hey, that's mine.

215
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:40,810
Debs, I need you to find
the backpacks

216
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:42,979
and any old school books.
Carl, put the day care supplies

217
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,648
- back in the basement.
- Okay.

218
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:47,050
Roger that.
Lip, you and Ian clean out the pool.

219
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:49,052
I think there's a few
surprises in there for you.

220
00:08:49,086 --> 00:08:50,719
Carl, tell Lip to
do it himself.

221
00:08:50,754 --> 00:08:52,888
Lip, Ian says you
can do it yourself.

222
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,823
Carl, tell Ian he's being
a douchebag

223
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,224
for still not talking to me.

224
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,525
Ian, Lip says you're being a...

225
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,060
Okay, whatever it is
that you guys are

226
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:01,195
still doing, I want it over
before school starts.

227
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,430
So figure it out.

228
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:03,731
Mommy, what's my assignment?

229
00:09:03,765 --> 00:09:05,265
Uh, go home to your family.

230
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,202
Actually, I need to
go get the boat ready.

231
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:09,437
Belmont Harbor.

232
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:11,705
Slip 22. 2:00.

233
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,773
I said I'll think about it.

234
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:13,974
Uh-huh.

235
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,545
I'm gonna see what
Fiona's cooking for breakfast.

236
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,614
Rooster in the henhouse.
Rooster in the henhouse.

237
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:22,883
Hide the money!

238
00:09:22,917 --> 00:09:25,052
Morning, Gram. Morning, Gram.
Morning, Grams.

239
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,454
Bye, Gram.
Bye, Grammy!

240
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,661
Your grandmother thinks
you're being selfish

241
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,162
by not spending
more time with her.

242
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:36,931
Why don't you two hang out?
Have girl time.

243
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:38,166
I'm gonna go.

244
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,668
Frank,

245
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:42,637
give me two three-minute eggs,
dry toast,

246
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,240
and a cup of Maxwell House
before we go to Indian Bingo.

247
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:48,476
Have fun, you guys.

248
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:52,412
Only one cup.

249
00:09:52,447 --> 00:09:53,914
Huh?

250
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:56,182
That's your second cup.
So?

251
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:59,618
So the baby book says caffeine's
not good for the fetus.

252
00:09:59,653 --> 00:10:01,453
Well, it's good for me.

253
00:10:01,488 --> 00:10:04,623
Hey, you want our baby
to come out healthy?

254
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:06,759
You okay?

255
00:10:06,793 --> 00:10:08,595
Yeah.
Sure?

256
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:10,363
Yes, stop asking me.

257
00:10:10,397 --> 00:10:11,865
I'm fine.

258
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,867
They're here.

259
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,335
Door's open.
Who's here?

260
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,004
My friends from tattoo
school, I told you.

261
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:19,607
Come in, come in.

262
00:10:19,642 --> 00:10:23,812
They're gonna give us some info
about natural childbirth.

263
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,848
Hey, you guys!

264
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:28,950
Look at this man,
hey, motherfucker!

265
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,652
Yeah, looking good,
looking good.

266
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:34,789
Just fucking sits there.

267
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:36,523
Should we take her
out of the cage?

268
00:10:36,558 --> 00:10:38,158
Probably needs to acclimate.

269
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:41,828
Let's call her
Ethel Number Two.

270
00:10:43,664 --> 00:10:45,398
What did we do wrong, V?

271
00:10:45,432 --> 00:10:47,000
We didn't do
anything wrong, Kev.

272
00:10:47,034 --> 00:10:49,903
I just feel like we should be out
there looking for her or something.

273
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,972
Social services says they're on it.
Oh, please.

274
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:53,808
Social services; you
think they have any time

275
00:10:53,842 --> 00:10:56,010
to go look for her?
You heard that woman.

276
00:10:56,044 --> 00:10:57,979
85% of foster kids run away.

277
00:10:58,013 --> 00:10:59,981
Well, there's nothing we can do.

278
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,550
Maybe she didn't
like living here.

279
00:11:01,584 --> 00:11:04,186
You just said 85% of
foster kids run away.

280
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,889
What makes you think we're
in the top 15% of households?

281
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:10,092
How can you be so cold
about this?

282
00:11:10,126 --> 00:11:12,561
'Cause she hurt my Kev.

283
00:11:12,596 --> 00:11:15,831
And no one hurts my Kev.

284
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,301
Come here.

285
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:21,904
Mmmmm.

286
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:24,440
Mmmm, my baby's
getting his mojo back.

287
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,876
It was never gone,
just on hold.

288
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,717
Oh, shit.

289
00:11:34,751 --> 00:11:36,386
What?

290
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,622
One of her weird underwear
things, so what?

291
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:40,956
I-I'm not in the mood anymore.

292
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,758
What? Well, where are you going?

293
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:45,527
The Alibi Room. We can do Lady
and the Tramp, if you want.

294
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,763
You know, I'm sorry if it's
gonna take me longer

295
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:49,664
to get over losing
our child than you, V.

296
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:55,303
Please don't go out in
public with that shirt.

297
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,812
Hey!

298
00:12:05,847 --> 00:12:07,481
I didn't text you back
for a reason.

299
00:12:07,515 --> 00:12:09,283
I wanna explain.

300
00:12:09,317 --> 00:12:11,585
Don't. I got everything
I need, Jimmy.

301
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,587
I'm still Fiona, by the way.
Fiona, Fiona.

302
00:12:13,622 --> 00:12:15,823
When I found out that you were
married, I was hurt.

303
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,726
But then when you had
a whole other life,

304
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,261
man, I realized I
dodged a bullet.

305
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:21,130
I was trying to explain
at the restaurant.

306
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:22,965
Not necessary.
We're totally cool.

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,302
Everything's great,
Jimmy-Steve.

308
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:31,874
I'll be seeing you around.

309
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:44,485
These powdered
donuts are fantastic!

310
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,853
I got them at Costco.

311
00:12:45,887 --> 00:12:47,655
Case was only five dollars.

312
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,991
We were there to get
a Vizio flat screen.

313
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,928
200 bucks later, no Vizio,
just a cart full of groceries.

314
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,997
Which we needed more than a TV.

315
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:57,467
It's hard to watch the game
on a baked ham, hon.

316
00:12:57,501 --> 00:13:00,203
You guys can use our membership
card anytime you want.

317
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,706
Great. Lots of stuff we need
around the house, huh, babe?

318
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,941
I guess.

319
00:13:03,975 --> 00:13:05,643
You know what you and I should
do, Karen?

320
00:13:05,677 --> 00:13:07,844
Can you pass the
Pop-Tarts, honey?

321
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,481
We should go in on a couple
of cases of diapers together.

322
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:13,316
Huh? Since our babies will
probably be born

323
00:13:13,351 --> 00:13:14,618
around the same time.

324
00:13:14,653 --> 00:13:16,220
You're pregnant?

325
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,688
Why do you think
I'm eating so much?

326
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:20,657
You could save a bundle
on your hospital bills

327
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:23,660
if you just have the baby
at home. You have a tub?

328
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:25,461
Yeah, upstairs.
Besides, if you

329
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:27,163
deliver at the hospital,
you run the risk

330
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:28,664
of them slicing you
like a turkey.

331
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,734
- What?
- Yeah, it's true.

332
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,702
Victor here-- come here, baby--

333
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:35,872
he was nine pounds.

334
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:39,343
His little elbow was stuck
behind my pelvis.

335
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:42,313
Doctors had to give me an episiotomy.
What's that?

336
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,850
It's where they cut you open
from vagina to anus.

337
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:47,852
You don't feel a thing.
It's good drugs.

338
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:49,020
I've got the video.

339
00:13:49,055 --> 00:13:52,091
Honey, she doesn't wanna
see that. Nobody wants to see.

340
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,694
I'm telling you, just have
the baby in the tub upstairs.

341
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:57,197
It'll squirt right out.
My lady business hasn't been

342
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:58,598
the same since the episiotomy.

343
00:13:58,633 --> 00:14:00,868
I swear I could fit
a walrus up there.

344
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,336
It's not that bad.

345
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,371
Then why did you wrap your
penis in toilet paper

346
00:14:04,405 --> 00:14:06,039
before putting
the condom on the other night?

347
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:07,908
You saw that?

348
00:14:07,942 --> 00:14:10,710
I've been pulling pieces
of tissue out of me all week.

349
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:13,013
Hey, Karen, you okay?

350
00:14:13,047 --> 00:14:17,017
Guess who the big winner was
in Indian Bingo.

351
00:14:18,886 --> 00:14:20,420
That a girl, Peggy!
Did you cheat?

352
00:14:20,454 --> 00:14:22,055
Of course.

353
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:24,958
"How" about you, Frank?
You win anything?

354
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:27,227
Come on, Mom, let me play.

355
00:14:27,261 --> 00:14:28,895
Did you bring any cash?

356
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:30,530
No...

357
00:14:30,564 --> 00:14:32,132
Then no Bingo for you.

358
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,366
Fuck you, Tommy.

359
00:14:34,735 --> 00:14:36,069
Hey, Kev.

360
00:14:36,103 --> 00:14:39,406
Hey, guys. What can I get you?

361
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,441
Couple of Old Styles
with whiskey backs

362
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,276
and a round for everyone on me.

363
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:48,447
Except for Jinny.
I haven't forgotten

364
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:52,718
you fucked my husband, you
miserable excuse for a vagina.

365
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:55,955
Hey, Kermit.

366
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,457
Frank.

367
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:00,661
Was wondering, your
sister still has MS, right?

368
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:02,463
Yeah, it kinda doesn't go away.

369
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:04,064
So your house is tricked out

370
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:06,099
with all that
handicapped crap then?

371
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:08,903
Handrails, shower bench,
Rascal scooter.

372
00:15:08,937 --> 00:15:11,772
How would you feel about taking in my mother?
She could pay rent.

373
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,640
No. It's just that I'm
getting really busy.

374
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,277
I'm not taking care
of your mother, Frank.

375
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,780
When he was ten,
our family cat was in heat.

376
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:22,082
And he thought that meant
we should open the windows.

377
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:30,824
Fire in the hole.

378
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:34,428
Jasmine invited me out
to David's boat today.

379
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:35,762
I never been on a boat.

380
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,798
Said it has gold-plated
bathroom fixtures. You going?

381
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:39,366
I don't know if I have time.

382
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,769
It's the end of summer.

383
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,671
Before you know it,
you'll be back to mittens

384
00:15:43,705 --> 00:15:45,306
and multiplication tables
again.

385
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,975
Maybe. I'm coming down.

386
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,344
It'll be a nice distraction
for Kev.

387
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:53,214
He's driving me crazy.
He's still upset?

388
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:55,516
It's not like Ethel was our real kid.
She was our job.

389
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,118
I'm getting them now!

390
00:15:57,152 --> 00:15:59,353
Bring down the Jergens.

391
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,856
I need you to massage my feet.

392
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,391
Fiona?
Hmm?

393
00:16:03,425 --> 00:16:05,326
We have to get rid
of your grandmother.

394
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,460
What?

395
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:07,795
Where are the toenail clippers?

396
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:09,196
I didn't wanna have

397
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,199
to say this,
but she's not happy here.

398
00:16:11,233 --> 00:16:13,835
Put 'em back when you're done.

399
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,472
These are never gonna cut
through her crusty talons.

400
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:19,974
How could she not be happy?

401
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,010
She just moved in a week ago.
Ah, he's full of shit.

402
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:23,878
He just doesn't wanna deal with her.
That's not true.

403
00:16:23,912 --> 00:16:26,881
I love having her here.
I wish I could spend

404
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:29,417
all my waking hours with her.
Do we have any bolt cutters?

405
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,220
Good, because she's staying.
The kids like having her around.

406
00:16:32,254 --> 00:16:33,822
It's not their house.

407
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:36,057
Do they pay rent?

408
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:38,760
She buys 'em things.

409
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,662
And she likes good food

410
00:16:40,696 --> 00:16:42,030
that she pays for.

411
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,598
You should've been here
two nights ago.

412
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,666
We had porterhouse.

413
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,668
You're invited and I'm not?

414
00:16:46,702 --> 00:16:50,037
And I need some
more chocolate Ensure.

415
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:53,541
Fiona, she's gone, with
or without your help.

416
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,249
What do you make
of these, Kermit?

417
00:17:01,283 --> 00:17:03,217
Three of the most boring
states of our country.

418
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:05,353
My foster daughter ran away.
Been sending me these.

419
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,589
I'm trying to figure out a
clue where she might be going

420
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:08,556
or why she left.

421
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,926
"Having a nice time
in Kansas. Ethel."

422
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,127
What does it mean?

423
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:14,029
If I had to guess,

424
00:17:14,063 --> 00:17:16,031
I'd say she's having
a nice time in Kansas.

425
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:19,268
Or she's being held at gunpoint.
Forced to write that.

426
00:17:19,302 --> 00:17:20,903
Great, Tommy. Like I'm not
worried enough, already.

427
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:23,773
I'm just saying you should get
these postcards DNA tested.

428
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:25,442
See if there's any other
fingerprints on them.

429
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:28,044
That's not gonna prove anything.
You know how

430
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,213
many people have touched this postcard before it got here?
Then throw a blue light on it.

431
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:33,382
Check to see if there's any
blood or sweat on it.

432
00:17:33,417 --> 00:17:35,751
Or semen. That'll
tell you a lot.

433
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:37,719
Could be right.
Many foster kids become prostitutes.

434
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,387
Jesus! Give me those!

435
00:17:39,421 --> 00:17:40,622
There's no semen on them,

436
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,323
and my kid's not a prostitute.

437
00:17:42,358 --> 00:17:43,824
Social services is on it.

438
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,326
Yeah, like they're on my
sister's welfare checks

439
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,261
that keep getting stolen
out of her mailbox?

440
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:50,464
I got to go to my game.
I'll see you guys later, okay?

441
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,635
Stan, Stan, what
the fuck are you doing?

442
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:55,836
Holy shit!

443
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,671
Look at the hog on Stan!

444
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,574
Got a baseball game.
What do you think?

445
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:00,975
I've heard rumors
about that thing.

446
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:02,844
Go back to your
apartment, please.

447
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:04,746
Oh, get your hands off
me, you knucklehead.

448
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,414
You're gonna make me
late for my game.

449
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:07,782
You don't have a baseball game.

450
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:10,017
Yes, I do-- it's
at Archer Field.

451
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:12,953
I saw it today on my calendar.
Oh, yeah, your calendar

452
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:14,821
from 1984? Come on,
let's go back upstairs.

453
00:18:14,856 --> 00:18:16,323
Well, who's gonna
play first base?

454
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,158
You know, I just got a call.

455
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:20,627
They canceled the game.
Oh, geez!

456
00:18:20,661 --> 00:18:22,462
I had a lot of
money on it, too.

457
00:18:22,496 --> 00:18:24,263
Damn it!

458
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:25,965
Damn it!

459
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:27,433
Come on, Kevin.

460
00:18:27,468 --> 00:18:28,969
It's time to call
Stan's daughter.

461
00:18:29,003 --> 00:18:31,038
Put him in a home.
Shut the fuck up, Kermit.

462
00:18:31,072 --> 00:18:33,474
Stan's not going anywhere.
And Ethel is not a prostitute.

463
00:18:35,644 --> 00:18:38,013
I'm surprised you called.

464
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,949
I need you to do
something for me.

465
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:42,718
What?

466
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:44,720
Get rid of Jody.

467
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:46,121
Kill him?
No.

468
00:18:46,156 --> 00:18:47,456
Just make him go away.

469
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,790
Everything he does

470
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:50,992
is bugging me.
Get a divorce.

471
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:54,796
Can't. He'll take half of the money
from my dad's life insurance.

472
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,131
Oh, you didn't get that yet?

473
00:18:57,165 --> 00:18:59,333
No, they said another
couple of months.

474
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,967
The police are
still investigating.

475
00:19:01,001 --> 00:19:03,536
Oh, yeah? But when I do
finally get it, though,

476
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,404
I'm gonna open a tanning salon.

477
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,005
Or buy a convertible.

478
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,040
Or get a boob job.

479
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,344
I should've done a prenup.

480
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:15,347
Well, it's not too late.

481
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,916
Aren't you supposed to get that
<i>before</i> you get married?

482
00:19:17,951 --> 00:19:19,918
Yeah, if you want to do things

483
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:21,187
the traditional way.

484
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,489
Look, we can print
one up online.

485
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:25,224
I know a guy;
he's a notary.

486
00:19:25,258 --> 00:19:27,360
He'll predate it for a
couple hundred bucks.

487
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:28,561
Really?

488
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:31,330
All you got to do is
get Jody to sign it.

489
00:19:31,365 --> 00:19:34,400
That'll be
easy-- he's an idiot.

490
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,403
You said it, not me.

491
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:40,040
...and the detectives
working with him decided

492
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:43,043
the time had come to pick up
the suspected murderer...

493
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,045
You're in my way.

494
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,513
What's wrong with the TV?

495
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:49,116
Nothing. This show's
in black and white.

496
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,786
You're still in my way.

497
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,020
Looks old.

498
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:54,222
So do I.

499
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,358
- Now, move.
- Here, Carl.

500
00:19:56,392 --> 00:19:59,595
I found these old
readers you can use.

501
00:20:06,003 --> 00:20:08,070
Little old for third
grade, aren't you?

502
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,806
It's my second time.

503
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:13,208
Not too smart, huh?

504
00:20:13,243 --> 00:20:15,077
Anything you're good at?

505
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:20,081
How about let's
teach you a skill?

506
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,651
Okay, we'll
have to do the best we can.

507
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:31,292
I'm not promising I'm having
any fun today, ladies.

508
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,961
Here it is.
Wow.

509
00:20:32,995 --> 00:20:35,296
Thought she was only
having a few people over.

510
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:43,607
Why don't we party like this?
'Cause you keep forgetting

511
00:20:43,641 --> 00:20:45,442
to buy us a boat.
Oh, that's right.

512
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,080
♪ ♪

513
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,448
Fiona! Hey!

514
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:53,450
Hi! Come on board!

515
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:55,851
Grab some champagne.
There's sushi.

516
00:20:55,886 --> 00:20:57,486
Guess who's here?

517
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,755
Right there!

518
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,256
With his W-I-F-E.

519
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,490
Oh, shit.

520
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,592
Are we doing this?

521
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,661
I want to see the Jacuzzi.

522
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,166
Excuse me.

523
00:21:13,201 --> 00:21:15,435
My grandmother's having
an allergy attack,

524
00:21:15,469 --> 00:21:17,270
and I need to buy
her some Sudafed,

525
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:19,973
but I'm under 18 and her
driver's license was revoked.

526
00:21:20,007 --> 00:21:21,341
Can you please buy it for her?

527
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:23,177
You making meth?

528
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:25,179

Yes, Officer...
Rodrigues.

536
00:21:44,268 --> 00:21:45,968
I think we may have a problem.

537
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:47,703
What kind of problem?
Well, uh,

538
00:21:47,737 --> 00:21:49,338
I'm not one to be a rat,

539
00:21:49,372 --> 00:21:52,041
but I think you might have
released an inmate in error.

540
00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:54,209
And who might that be?
Peggy Gallagher.

541
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:56,078
You mean Body Bag?
That's her

542
00:21:56,112 --> 00:21:58,846

Yes, she was released on medical furlough.

00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,214
That's just the thing.

544
00:22:00,249 --> 00:22:02,183
She's not sick;
she's faking it.

545
00:22:02,217 --> 00:22:04,185
Are you her doctor?
No.

546
00:22:04,219 --> 00:22:06,654
But I saw her in a
kick-boxing class today.

547
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:10,025
A 78-year-old woman?
I'm trying to do my part

548
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:12,928
to preserve the integrity
of our penal system.

549
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:14,730
She's old;
she can barely walk.

00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:17,433

Ooh, that shit is awesome.
Oh, you should've been

565
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:49,799
hanging out with me sooner.

566
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,968
It was snowing all summer

567
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:53,203
in Chicago!

568
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:54,738
So this is where
the party's at.

569
00:22:54,772 --> 00:22:56,473
What's up, you dirty fucker?

570
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:58,808
How's it hanging? Long and hairy.
Hard to carry.

571
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,812
I miss you, man.

572
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:03,547
You sure that's not
just the drugs talking?

573
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:04,648
It might be.

574
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,116
You remember Kev and the gang.

575
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,251
<i>Si, si. Ola.</i>

576
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,252
<i>Ola!</i>

577
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,587
Ooh, I love this song!

578
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:12,489
Estephania, let's go dance.

579
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:15,259
Have you ever done
Jell-O shots?

580
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:16,927
Ooh, you are so sexy!

581
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:19,229
What are you waiting for, bro?
Drop trou, jump in.

582
00:23:19,263 --> 00:23:21,097
All right. What?

583
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:30,005
Ooh!

584
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,810
What do you expect? I've been in
Brazil for the past six months.

585
00:23:41,952 --> 00:23:44,187
Where are you going?

586
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,824
I thought you said
we were totally cool.

587
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,929
I like your bathing suit.
Thank you.

588
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:57,101
For the first day of school,
what if I wear this red top,

589
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:59,770
with these blue shorts?

590
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,139
Must be nice to not
get hand-me-downs.

591
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,142
Or is the pink top better?

592
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:06,344
Not stuck with Lip's old crap.

593
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,713
It has flowers on it.

594
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,882
Flowers are for
babies, aren't they?

595
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,151
You're lucky Fiona's clothes
don't fit you yet.

596
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:14,686
Get to have

597
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,154
all new stuff.

598
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:18,957
Ian, I'm gonna need
a little more help than this.

599
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:20,826
Oh, good, you're here.

600
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,661
I'm trying to make
a good impression

601
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:24,663
for my last year
of elementary school.

602
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,731
Red top, blue shorts.

603
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,998
That's what I thought.

604
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28,633
Thanks.

605
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,737
Karen and I are
getting back together.

606
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,840
She ditched Jody.

607
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:38,009
Now I can step up,
be a father to our kid.

608
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,577
Why? What's wrong with Jody?

609
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:40,912
He's a tool.

610
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,380
He is?
Mm-hmm.

611
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,649
How will I know if
I'm dating a tool?

612
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:45,683
You'll figure it out.

613
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,886
Or I'll beat the shit
out of him for you.

614
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,489
Okay. Cool.

615
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,833
Pathetic.

616
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,269
Ladies and gentlemen,
he speaks!

617
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:05,406
You could have
anything you want.

618
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,441
This is the life you choose?

619
00:25:07,476 --> 00:25:10,578
I'm not gonna split
on my kid like Frank.

620
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:11,946
Fucking waste.
You know what?

621
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,614
You're the one that's
pretending to date Mandy

622
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:15,383
so you can fuck her brother.

623
00:25:15,417 --> 00:25:18,285
You know, even the Pentagon
says it's okay to be gay,

624
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,254
but you're too chicken-shit
to let anyone know.

625
00:25:20,288 --> 00:25:22,555
At least I'm not getting trapped
by some pregnant skank.

626
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,723
Fuck you!

627
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:25,391
You'll probably quit
high school, huh?

628
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,727
Start working at Best Buy.
Watch your fuckin' mouth!

629
00:25:27,761 --> 00:25:30,029
Wonder how long it takes
before you start huffing glue.

630
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:33,566
Hey! Hey!

631
00:25:35,469 --> 00:25:41,742
Put all that Sudafed
down in the basement, Carl.

632
00:25:41,776 --> 00:25:44,277
I know what's going on here.

633
00:25:44,312 --> 00:25:48,149
Saw it with my own boys.

634
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:51,152
One of the lions
has to leave the den.

635
00:25:51,187 --> 00:25:53,989
Strongest one's got
to push the other one out,

636
00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,224
or eat him.

637
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:56,925
Only one way to resolve this,

638
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,494
somebody's got to bleed.

639
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,829
Fight it out.

640
00:25:59,864 --> 00:26:01,731
See who's alpha wolf.

641
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:02,899
I'll kick your fuckin' ass.

642
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,768
You won't last two minutes.

643
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,570
No knives, no guns, no bricks.

644
00:26:06,604 --> 00:26:07,838
Just fists.

645
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:09,139
Tomorrow?

646
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,007
Labor Day.
I work till 5:00.

647
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:12,976
At 6:00, then, under the El.
Okay.

648
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:17,180
Dark chocolate Ensure,

649
00:26:17,214 --> 00:26:18,948
just like you wanted.

650
00:26:18,983 --> 00:26:20,250
Too late.

651
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:21,818
Got to go to bed.

652
00:26:21,853 --> 00:26:23,954
Take me upstairs.

653
00:26:23,988 --> 00:26:26,756
And I'm gonna need you to
powder under my tits.

654
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,893
I'm chafing like
a son of a bitch.

655
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,963
Honey, I'm so sorry.

656
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:35,099
We should try to get
on <i>Take the Money and Run</i>

657
00:26:35,133 --> 00:26:36,333
after you have the baby.

658
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:37,602
We could totally win.

659
00:26:37,636 --> 00:26:40,137
Oh, gosh, I forgot.

660
00:26:40,172 --> 00:26:42,273
I need you to sign
a few things.

661
00:26:42,307 --> 00:26:44,508
Can it wait till
after the show's over?

662
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:47,278
It'll just take a second.

663
00:26:47,312 --> 00:26:48,879
What are they?

664
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:50,648
Joint credit card application.

665
00:26:50,682 --> 00:26:51,983

Safety-deposit box.

667
00:26:53,652 --> 00:26:55,620
Just some boring bank stuff.

668
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,455
Oh, man, poor guy's crying

669
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,291

670
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:01,527
Just sign here.

00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:14,806

Good. I'm glad

Hey, did V tell you we're
gonna hit the highway,

689
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,546
try to find Ethel?
We're what?

Shit, did I not say that
out loud to you yet?

No.
The idea came to me

692
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:03,885
when I did my third
line of coke.

693
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,388
We are not riding
down Route 66 looking for Ethel.

694

698
00:28:14,063 --> 00:28:15,296
Guys, guys, guys, come on,

00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,234

Oh, you know what?
You're not leaving. I'm leaving.

702
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,906
I said it first.
Yeah, well, I said it last.

703
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,975
I will throw your ass
over the boat! Keep it up!

704
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,210
I'm gonna check

I'm gonna kill her.

789
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:27,513

Stan, look after each other.

Where's your mother?

799
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,204
Said she didn't need me
this morning,

800
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,740
had some personal
business to do.

801
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:56,977
I change her diaper-- what's
more personal than that?

802
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:58,611

but you were right.

807
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:12,760

816
00:34:32,479 --> 00:34:34,346
Talked to my friend Lisa,
and she said

817
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,648
this is what happens to women

818
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:37,816

00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,796
Get out.
You're lucky I don't

879
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,130
drown you.
Ah, get out.

880
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:08,399
Geez...

881
00:37:08,433 --> 00:37:10,902
Okay, so we'll clean up the meth
lab, air the place out,

882
00:37:10,936 --> 00:37:12,738
and then call the cops.

883
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,906
They'll bring her to
a geriatric psych ward,

884
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,575
Hold her 72 hours,
do an evaluation.

885
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,843
What if they find her normal?

886
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:19,946
Aw, get the f...
Okay, you're right.

887
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,615
When she doesn't pass,
they'll hold her

888
00:37:21,649 --> 00:37:23,817
for another 14 days
and test her again.

889
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:25,919
Why didn't we think
of this sooner?

890
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,021
I warned you about
this yesterday.

891
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:31,591
But do you listen to
me? No, you don't.

892
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:33,159
Shit, Carl.
We could've avoided every...

893
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,295
What's going on?
What happened?

894
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,297
I'm fine.

895
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:39,932
Don't listen to them.

896
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,366
Are you the guardians
of Margaret Gallagher?

897
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:43,435
She is.

898
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,936
She's my grandmother.

899
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,137
What happened?

900
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:47,672
Well, your grandmother
blacked out.

901
00:37:47,706 --> 00:37:49,874
She was at an Ace
Hardware, fell,

902
00:37:49,908 --> 00:37:52,009
Was taken to the emergency room.
What was it?

903
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:53,944
E.R. doc says cancer.

904
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:55,379
Stage four pancreatic.

905
00:37:55,413 --> 00:37:56,681
Doesn't have long to live.

906
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,949
Thank you, Lord.

907
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:00,150
Grammy.

908
00:38:00,185 --> 00:38:02,152
Hey, it smells in here.

909
00:38:02,187 --> 00:38:03,620
You blow up our lab?

910
00:38:03,654 --> 00:38:05,889
A little bit.
Oh, come here.

911
00:38:05,923 --> 00:38:08,191
We'll get it right next time.

912
00:38:08,226 --> 00:38:10,360
She's got to be in
a lot of pain.

913
00:38:10,394 --> 00:38:12,462
Shouldn't be leaving the house.

914
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:14,798
These morons don't know
what they're talking about.

915
00:38:14,832 --> 00:38:17,334
Sign this form, please.

916
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:19,069
If she were my grandmother,
I'd call hospice.

917
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:23,307
They can manage her pain,
make her more comfortable.

918
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:29,046
Hey, knucklehead,
set up the card table.

919
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,582
I want to teach Carl a
little five card stud.

Now, where were we?

930
00:39:08,452 --> 00:39:11,788
You know, it's okay.
It's okay.

931
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:15,525
But I owe you for the prenup.

932
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,960
It's a little hard to keep going

933
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,029
with Michael Bolton
out there serenading us.

934
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:21,964
I'm gonna get a
restraining order.

935
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,299
That's okay.

936
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:26,068
I got to go beat the shit
out of Ian anyway.

937
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:29,139
I'll call you later.

938
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:32,142
If you don't like Air
Supply, I know other songs.

939
00:39:36,314 --> 00:39:37,814
You're late.

940
00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:40,417
Where the fuck have you been?
Getting blown

941
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:43,720
by some pregnant skank,
as you called her.

942
00:39:43,755 --> 00:39:45,155
'Cause that's what she is.

943
00:40:10,013 --> 00:40:11,047
Ow!

944
00:40:15,988 --> 00:40:17,054
Fuck.

945
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:32,538
I'm sick of living
in your shadow.

946
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:35,340
Who the fuck's asking you to?

947
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:39,211
It's hard not to when all my
clothes are hand-me-downs.

948
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:42,047
Yeah, well it's not my
fault I was born first

949
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:45,783
or more handsome or...

950
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,318
...smarter.

951
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:48,786
Asshole.

952
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,155
Dickhead.

953
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:01,834
Want to get a beer?

954
00:41:04,071 --> 00:41:06,005
Yeah.

955
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,224
Let's go.

956
00:41:24,258 --> 00:41:25,859
School, come on, monkeys.

957
00:41:25,894 --> 00:41:28,929
Carl, come on.
Get out of there.

958
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:30,898
Our house still
smells like meth.

959
00:41:30,932 --> 00:41:32,466
Yeah? Whose
fault is that?

960
00:41:34,603 --> 00:41:35,836
Whoa, good way to start school.

961
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,074
Wow, you look nice, Debs.

962
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:41,308
Thanks.

963
00:41:42,878 --> 00:41:46,113
Hey, little fella, did you get
out of your crib yourself?

964
00:41:46,148 --> 00:41:47,415
My gosh.

965
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:49,951
Lip, come on, wake up.

966
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:53,421
The Gallagher tickle spot.

967
00:41:53,455 --> 00:41:55,223
Come on, first day
of school, senior.

968
00:41:55,257 --> 00:41:57,559
Oh, not going.
You sick?

969
00:41:57,593 --> 00:41:58,893
Nope.

970
00:41:58,928 --> 00:42:00,061
Dropped out.

971
00:42:00,096 --> 00:42:01,263
What are you talking about?

972
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,031
Quit.

973
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:04,266
You only have a year left.

974
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,634
Got to get a job.

975
00:42:05,668 --> 00:42:08,570
Take care of Karen and my kid.

976
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:21,883
Kev?

977
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:24,919
Kev, wake up.

978
00:42:24,954 --> 00:42:26,788
What is it?
Ethel's missing.

979
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,890
I know, for two weeks.

980
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:30,859
Not that Ethel,
Ethel Number Two.

981
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,397
Ethel!

982
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:37,132
How'd she get out
in the first place?

983
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:38,333
Ethel!

984
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,169
Baby?

985
00:42:40,203 --> 00:42:41,670
Was cleaning out her cage.

986
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:42,905
Ethel!

987
00:42:42,939 --> 00:42:44,607
And?
Forgot the back door was open.

988
00:42:44,641 --> 00:42:46,008
V...

989
00:42:46,043 --> 00:42:47,911
It was hot inside.

990
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:49,846
Yeah, well, you let
our new bunny escape.

991
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,148
I didn't do it on purpose.

992
00:42:58,387 --> 00:43:01,623
Hey. Come here, I'm
sorry, don't cry.

993
00:43:01,657 --> 00:43:02,958
It's all my fault.

994
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:06,961
No, it isn't.

995
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:10,131
I was... I was cold to her
when she first got here.

996
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:12,334
Yeah, but you warmed
up real quick.

997
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:15,004
'Cause I loved her.

998
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:16,606
She knew that.

999
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,212
Then why did she leave us?

1000
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:24,348
I wish I knew.

1001
00:43:29,521 --> 00:43:32,456
We're talking about
the real Ethel, right?

1002
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:39,863
I think we should
have our own kid.

1003
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,798
Are you serious?

1004
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:44,233
Yeah.

1005
00:43:44,268 --> 00:43:45,501
Yeah?

1006
00:43:45,536 --> 00:43:46,736
Well, hell.

1007
00:43:48,238 --> 00:43:49,906
Could we start right now?

1008
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,741
Mm-hmm!

1009
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,176
Ethel!

1010
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:57,147
Oh, shit, there she is.
Hey, hold on.

1011
00:43:57,182 --> 00:43:59,850
Don't you hop away from us,
you dumb fucking whore.

1012
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:02,353
Hi, I'm calling
about my brother.

1013
00:44:02,387 --> 00:44:03,587
Uh, yeah, I can hold.

1014
00:44:03,621 --> 00:44:04,822
Hey.

1015
00:44:04,856 --> 00:44:06,724
Hi, I'm on hold.

1016
00:44:06,758 --> 00:44:08,392
Sorry about the other night.

1017
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:09,593
I was pretty drunk.

1018
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:10,861
Uh, yeah, I'm still here.

1019
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:12,529
Uh, Phillip Gallagher,
12th grade,

1020
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:14,431
Uh, won't be in school today.

1021
00:44:14,466 --> 00:44:15,665
He's sick.

1022
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,401
I think it's just
a summer cold.

1023
00:44:17,435 --> 00:44:18,603
He'll be there tomorrow.

1024
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:20,705
Okay, okay, bye.

1025
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm pretty embarrassed
about the other night.

1026
00:44:22,474 --> 00:44:25,076
It's okay, don't-don't
even worry about it.

1027
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,378
Hey, I have some
blow left over.

1028
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:29,046
Could get into some
trouble today.

1029
00:44:29,081 --> 00:44:30,548
Uh, you should go home.

1030
00:44:30,582 --> 00:44:32,850
Actually, I don't have a home.

1031
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:34,719
What?

1032
00:44:34,753 --> 00:44:35,720
Yeah, Hal found out about David.

1033
00:44:35,754 --> 00:44:37,255
He kicked me out
a couple of weeks ago.

1034
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:39,391
Jesus.
Yeah, it's okay.

1035
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:41,593
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, right?

1036
00:44:41,627 --> 00:44:42,761
I guess so.

1037
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:44,229
Now I get to start over.

1038
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,632
Do what I want,
be a single woman.

1039
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:49,568
What about your kids?

1040
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,803
Are they doing okay?

1041
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:52,538
Hal's better with them.

1042
00:44:52,572 --> 00:44:54,573
I've just been staying
on David's boat, although

1043
00:44:54,607 --> 00:44:56,708
he didn't know about it until
the cops showed up last night.

1044
00:44:56,742 --> 00:44:58,142
You've been breaking in
to his boat?

1045
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:00,578
He never uses it;
it's just sitting there.

1046
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:03,581
I gave him the best
blow jobs of his life.

1047
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,082
You saw him.

1048
00:45:05,117 --> 00:45:06,584
I was so out of his league.

1049
00:45:06,618 --> 00:45:09,253
I got to get in the shower.

1050
00:45:09,287 --> 00:45:10,788
Start looking for a job.

1051
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:13,324
Hey, do you think I could
stay here for a couple of days?

1052
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:14,791
What?

1053
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:16,760
Yeah, I'll kick
in some rent money.

1054
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:18,495
No.

1055
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,896
No?

1056
00:45:19,931 --> 00:45:21,331
But I do everything for you.

1057
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:23,233
What are you talking about?

1058
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,434
I brought Steve to the party,

1059
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,168
I gave you a job this winter.

1060
00:45:26,203 --> 00:45:29,138
I-I gave you clothes
and jewelry.

1061
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:50,261
She still alive?

1062
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:51,862
I haven't been up there.

1063
00:45:51,897 --> 00:45:53,230
Fuck me.

1064
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:58,135
I got Estefania drunk

1065
00:45:58,169 --> 00:45:59,936
so that you could
have sex with Steve.

1066
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,372
I didn't want
to have sex with Steve.

1067
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,640
Right.

1068
00:46:04,675 --> 00:46:06,309
I don't need you
meddling in my life.

1069
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:07,711
Meddling?

1070
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:09,946
When you need something
from me it's fine,

1071
00:46:09,981 --> 00:46:11,381
but when I need something,

1072
00:46:11,416 --> 00:46:13,150
suddenly little Miss
Fiona just runs away?

1073
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:14,552
Okay, you need to go.

1074
00:46:14,586 --> 00:46:16,654
Fine! I don't give a shit!

1075
00:46:16,688 --> 00:46:19,824
You just kick me out,
like David and Hal.

1076
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:22,493
You're all just a
bunch of assholes!

1077
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:30,368
Jasmine?

1078
00:46:30,403 --> 00:46:33,238
Fuck...

1079
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:39,677
Get out of my yard.

1080
00:46:41,613 --> 00:46:43,680
Why didn't you meet
me at the airport?

1081
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:48,852
I was on my way.

1082
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:51,387
What happened?

1083
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:54,858
Doesn't matter now.

1084
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:57,729
I love you.

1085
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:03,735
