不敢相信,我们做到了
I can't believe we just did that.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,574
嘿,Eddie
Hello,Eddie.

19
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,853
再给我点时间
I need more time.

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,970
- 时间到了,我要拿回我的一万块 - 我现在没钱
- Time's up,I want my 10,000. - I haven't got it.

21
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,779
都怪那群该死的骗子 他们不肯付钱
It's these bloody grifters,they don't pay for anything.

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,533
那你就不该让他们在你酒吧里面赌,不是么?
Then you shouldn't let them gamble in your bar,should you?

23
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,737
我的意思是,我是个警察 我必须上报这件事
I mean,I am a police officer.I've got to report it.

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,418
- 你将失去你的执照 - 你不能这么做
- You're gonna lose your license. - But you can't.

25
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,532
这个地方是我所有的全部了
This place is all I've got.

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,291
你从没蹲过监狱吧,Eddie?
You ever been to prison,Eddie?

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,255
那是什么?
What's that?

28
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,699
这是要你在前台收银的抽屉 里解决的假钞
That's counterfeit money you've been laundering through your till.

29
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,369
求你了
Please.

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,573
告诉你,要我帮你,也得给我个名头 我要得是大鱼
I tell you what,I will settle for some names.I want the big fish.

不,不行.我不会告密的

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,929
回答错误,Eddie
Wrong answer,Eddie.

好的,好的!
Okay!

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,168
有伙人常在这里喝东西 他们很善于干这个
There's this crew that drink in here,they play the long con.

飞天大盗 第2季第4集
S02E04 Missions

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,579
也许我在这儿漏了点儿什么
Maybe I am missing something here.

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,211
只是,我觉得我们不是骗子么
Only,I thought we were grifters.

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,059
- 我的意思是,我不可能偷了这个的呀 - 那又怎么样?
- I mean we could've lifted this. - And then what?

44
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,210
我不知道,干好我们的本份,不是嘛?
I don't know.Do our thing,don't we?

45
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,259
创造奇迹
Work the magic.

46
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,974
说得好,Danny
Great plan,Danny.

47
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,576
我们干活的资金不够了 我们要搞点现金
It's wiped out our working capital.We will have to raise some cash.

48
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,892
把它当作一项投资
Think of it as an investment.

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,616
黑色风暴曾是个超级英雄,而这个
Black Storm was one of the original superheroes,and this...

50
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,977
就如同连环画界的蒙娜丽莎
is the Mona Lisa of comic book artwork.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,009
这就是我们为什么要付11万镑的原因
That's why we had to pay ?10,000 for it.

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,212
他们说你要绞尽脑汁来存钱
They say you have to speculate to accumulate.

53
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,979
不对,你知道,这不对劲
No,you know,it feels all wrong.

54
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,977
我们应该为我们自己而感到自豪
We should be really proud of ourselves.

55
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:06,894
终于有这么一次 我们不用犯法了
For once,we did not break the law.

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,095
Ash,拍卖所的平面图看起来怎么样?
Ash,how are the auction house blueprints looking?

57
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,139
不简单,不过可以搞定
It won't be easy,but it's definitely doable.

58
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,013
是的,我们距离拍卖还有两周时间
Right,we've got two weeks until the next auction.

59
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,058
同时,我们要去搞点活动资金
Meantime,we'll need to raise some working capital.

60
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,088
但这个美妙之处在于 我们的人马可以推迟现金的流动
But the beauty of it is,our guy can delay the currency movement...

61
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,136
以便我们能够部好局
just long enough for us to place a spread bet.

62
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,656
我们就净赚百分之三百四百的利润了 轻而易举
We've been clearing 300,400% profit,easy.

63
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,809
太棒了!
Wow!

64
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,375
- 这太美妙了 - 美妙是美妙,但是是违法的
- That's beautiful. - That's beautiful,but illegal.

65
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,132
- 但是万无一失? - 完全没问题
- But foolproof? - Completely.

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,009
算我一份,当然,我们一块干
I'm in.Definitely.Let's do it.

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,654
没错
Right.

68
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,617
你做不做傻瓜?这是2万5千镑
You'd have to be an idiot not to.?5,000.

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,854
谢谢
Thank you.

70
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,577
让我们看看我们有多少了
Let's see what we've got here.

71
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,612
哦,谢谢
Yeah.Thank you.

72
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,339
生活所迫啊
Beats working for a living.

73
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,768
有事吗?
Can I help you?

74
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,899
我以诈骗罪逮捕你们
I am arresting you for fraud.

75
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,698
你们可以保持沉默
You don't have to say anything...

76
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,578
Danny当你对所问的不说话将会
but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned...

77
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,776
成为你日后的成堂证供
something which you later rely on in court.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,779
我们可以现在就开始
You can go for now.

79
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,530
我会联系你的,来做笔录的
I will contact you,take a statement.

80
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,854
转过来
Turn around.

81
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,216
好了,我们做个交易
Okay,here's the deal.

82
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,978
要么你们两个去监狱 要么我带着钱
You two can go to prison,or I can walk out of here...

83
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,210
从这里走出去,然后我们 当作什么也没发生过
with the money and we all forget this ever happened.

84
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,494
两面派警察
A bent copper.

85
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,415
- 这就是所谓的"保护公民,服务社会" - 真聪明
- So much for "Protect and Serve." - Brilliant.

86
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,893
你认为我们会让你
You think for one second that we are going to let you...

87
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,494
从这里大摇大摆走出去,还带着2万5千镑?
swan out of here with ?5,000?

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,373
想得美,小妞
You're dreaming,missy.

89
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,293
恐怕这正是你们所要做的
I think that's exactly what you're going to do...

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,929
除非Mickey现在有更好的主意
unless Mickey here fancies another spell inside.

91
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,099
还没有
Not particularly.

92
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,091
嘿,像你这样的人 让警察有了个坏名声
People like you,yeah,they give the police a very bad name.

93
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,658
我接受,那我们来谈谈吧,就现在,好吧
I take it we have a deal.Now,okay.

94
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,569
一干蠢事,他就来作证 而你们俩,就进监狱
Do anything stupid,he testifies,you two go to prison.

95
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,329
明白了没有?
Got it?

96
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,499
你明白他们所说的,该来的躲不掉
You know what they say,what goes around comes around.

97
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,455
那如果我是你的话 我现在就会很担心的
Then I'd be seriously worried,if I were you.

98
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,820
- 你们的? - 是的,我喜欢画画
- Yours? - Yeah,I like to draw.

99
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,537
- 你很了不起么? - 我的美术老师也这么说
- You are very good,aren't you? - That's what my art teacher said.

100
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,088
现在,一伙骗子
Now,what would a couple of grifters be doing...

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,856
要价值10万英镑的艺术品干吗
with artwork worth 100,000?

102
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,375
正如目录上所说 我们要对它进行拍卖
Like the catalogue says,we're auctioning it.

103
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,250
是的,我是说这个完全合法 我们有收据和一切证明
Yeah,I mean it's completely legit.We got receipts,we got everything.

104
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,335
她想干吗?
What's she doing?

105
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,854
你要干吗?
What are you doing?

106
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,485
基本上,你有5秒钟的时间
Basically you've got five seconds 

107
00:07:38,486 --> 00:07:40,933
来告诉我你们的计划,要么我就点着了它
to tell me the score or I torch it.

108
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,578
告诉你吧,没有什么计划
We told you.There's no score.

109
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,935
是的,我们只是在拍卖一些艺术作品
Yeah,we're auctioning some artwork.

110
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,254
没有法律说这个不行
No law against it.

111
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,018
- 没有什么计划 - 你敢
- There's no score. - You wouldn't dare.

112
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,975
好吧好吧!我们告诉你!快灭了它!
All right!We will tell you!Put it out!

113
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,012
现在,我要你一五一十老实交代
Now,you tell me everything...

114
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,137
这次,可不仅仅只是一块啤酒垫子
or this time,it won't be a beer mat.

115
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,096
我们打算今天下午拍卖这件艺术品
We're auctioning the artwork this afternoon.

116
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,490
我们需要一个真品 因为拍卖行会进行鉴定
We needed a genuine piece because the auction house like to authenticate...

117
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,298
艺术品,然后才会卖了它
the artwork before they sell it.

118
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,650
当它在台上展示的时候
While it's on display at the viewing...

119
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,977
我们就用赝品把真品换了
we switch the authentic artwork for a forgery.

120
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,131
真正拍卖掉的是赝品
It's the forgery that gets auctioned.

121
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,733
然后在另一方面
And then on the side...

122
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,698
我们把它卖给对头的收藏家
we sell the authentic artwork to a rival collector.

123
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,490
是的,我们说明白了吧?10万美元的利润?
Yeah,and we clear 100,000 profit.

124
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,296
你明白了没有?5万英镑的利润 我拿另外的5万
You clear 50,000 profit.I get the other 50.

125
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,255
5万英镑?
Fifty?

126
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,218
打个电话到拍卖所 你一毛钱不用出
One phone call to the auction house,you don't make a penny.

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,060
现在,我们要2万5来付赝品
Now,we need the 25,000 to pay the forger.

128
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,175
很公平
Fair enough.

129
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,578
放心,拍卖结束后 我们会跟你碰头的
Don't worry,we will meet you back here after the auction.

130
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,652
你知道吗?我想我会尾随其后的
You know what?I think I will tag along for the ride.

131
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,219
一个条件
One condition.

132
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,811
一旦你拿到钱 告诉我们,谁出卖了我们
Once you get your money,tell us who sold us out.

133
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,176
你凭什么认为有人出卖了你们?
What makes you think someone sold you out?

134
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,937
那么,去哪里?
So,where to?

135
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,058
我们要去拿赝品
We need to pick up the forgery.

136
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,932
再见,Eddie
Bye,Eddie.

137
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,133
- 一切还好吧,Mick? - 好得不得了
- Everything all right,Mick? - Absolutely fantastic.

138
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,813
这下好了,你说我们现在怎么办?告诉其他人吗?
This is great.What do you think we should do?Tell the others?

139
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,016
不,他们有事情要做,所以...
No,they've got their jobs to do.So...

140
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,295
没人告诉你们窃窃私语很不礼貌?

有什么问题吗?

我们在最后时刻要出价高过这 两个收藏家,他们可不想再输了
The two collectors we outbid at the last auction won't want to lose out again.

150
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,777

- 稍稍的鼓励就可以了 - 完全正确

嘿,你看,这是你的事
Well,that's your problem,you see.

159

你天天早出晚归,而你却能够得到 煤气的安全检查
You're out all day,you get a buildup of gas from a faulty appliance.

160
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,370
你一回来,轻轻一按开关,!
You come home,flick on a light switch,bang!

161
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,770
还有件事情你要知道 他们会让你脑浆流一地的
Next thing you know,they are scraping your brains off the pavement.

162
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,818

打扰一下

虽然,我一直更喜欢作为普通人的Clark Kent,你知道
Although,I've always preferred him more as Clark Kent,you know.

170
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,095
强壮,但是显得脆弱,你知道
Strong,but vulnerable,you know...

171
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,092

这是我的店
It's my shop.

178
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,173
你怎么看?
What do you know about that?

179
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,894
不好意思
Excuse me.

180
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,379
什么?
Yeah?

181
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,135
我无意中看到你的拍卖目录 是snap
I couldn't help noticing your auction catalogue.Snap.

182
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,778
你肯定是为流行艺术展而来吧
You must be here for the pop-art exhibition.

183
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,657
是的,我是Lichtenstein的超级粉丝
Yeah,I am a sucker for Lichtenstein.

184
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,493
- 你是收藏家吗? - 我被认为是在浪费时间
- Are you a collector? - I've been known to dabble.

185
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,696
或许你能够为我解释一些问题
Perhaps you could clear something up for me.

186
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,011
你对于
What do you make of the idea...

187
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,297
Lichtenstein在他的作品中 嘲笑自己的主题这个说法,怎么看?
that Lichtenstein is mocking his subjects in his paintings?

188
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,259
一个很普遍的误解.我能做过来吗?
A common misconception.May I?

189
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,656
哦,当然,请坐
Please,yes,of course.

190
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,932
Lichtenstein的连环画所 展示的是一个成年人
What Lichtenstein's comic book paintings show is a grown man finding...

191
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,534
在他所应该抛弃的垃圾中 寻到了生活意义
meaning in junk he's supposed to have thrown away.

192
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,494
这是关于能力和成年人梦幻的故事

是的
Yes.

194
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,372
那么,为什么是连环画?
So,why comic books?

195
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,451
Mickey还是孩子的时候就迷上了他们
Mickey was into them when he was a kid.

196
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,532
因为传统艺术世界有太多的保安
Because there's too much security in the traditional art world.

197
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,339
他就是那种有点作的孩子 你知道,一天到晚哭
He was one of those specky kids.You know,a lot of crying.

198
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,819
- 请不要欺侮我 - 而且,这件艺术品也很容易仿造
- "Please don't bully me." - Plus,the artwork is easier to forge.

199
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,290
是,没错,Mickey 你一直这么跟你的同伴这么说的,对吧?
Yeah,that's right,Mickey.You keep telling yourself that,mate,yeah?

200
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,373
谁会想到会干这么个小勾当
Who would have thought it,the great Mickey Bricks taking the easy option.

201
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,299
对,很好 从你这样的寄生虫口里说出来
Yeah,that's good,coming from a parasite like you.

202
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,612
就在靠右边
It's just down here on the right.

203
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,256
真是太棒了,tim肯定会喜欢的
It's perfect.Tim will love it.

204
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,016
- 多谢帮忙 - 没事,很乐意效劳
- Thanks for all your help. - No,it was a pleasure.

205
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,888
那,再见
Bye-bye,then.

206
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,334
3,2,1
Three,two,one.

207
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,689
你待会儿有事吗?
Are you doing anything later?

208
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,692
待会儿有个拍卖,关于连环画艺术的
There's an auction,comic book artwork.

209
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,089
也许你和你侄子会想来?
Maybe you and your nephew would like to come?

210
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,415
- 我们很乐意 - 太好了
- We'd love to. - Great.

211
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,015
很好
Great.

212
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,253
同样栩栩如生的风格 大胆的主色
It's the same energetic style,bold primary colors.

213
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,777
你会在后来Warhol的作品里 找到同样专心致志的东西
The same single-mindedness you later find in Warhol's work.

214
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,769
正是连环画激发了流行艺术运动
The comics inspired the pop-art movement.

215
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,613
我愿不惜一切代价拥有 它的原始的版本
I'd sell my soul to own an original piece.

216

告诉你个小秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.

I'll be bidding for some original artwork at the auction.

218
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,489
真的?是哪位艺术家?
Really?Which artist?

219
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,655
黑色暴风,连环画界的蒙娜丽沙
Black Storm,the Mona Lisa of comic book artwork.

220
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,851
那我们一起去拍卖会
We could go to the auction together.

221
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,457
好了,我们要2万5英镑
Right,we'll need the 25,000.

222
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,010
- 我跟你一块去 - 别,那可不是个好主意
- I'm coming in with you. - No,that might not be such a good idea.

223
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,173
- 你也知道那些艺术家的样子 - 是啊,你知道,他们非常敏感
- You know what these artists are like. - Yeah,you know,very sensitive.

224
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,730
一说错话,你就侮辱了他
Say the wrong thing and you'll crush him.

225
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,417
别说我们没有警告过你
Don't say we didn't warn you.

226
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,539
要25,000 这幅赝品应该不错
For 25,000,this forgery had better be good.

227
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,859
Danny,你这个帅气的小捣蛋鬼 过来
Danny,you handsome little prick.Come here.

228
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,011
别给我个熊抱(大大的拥抱)
Not the bear hug.

229
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,176
- 嗨,Mickey - 你好吗?
- Hey,Mickey. - How you doing?

230
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,093

好了,现在我们来找出哪个是赝品

235

- 这是胡扯,是不是? - 到底哪一幅?
- Is that the dog's bollocks,or what? - Which one is it?

236
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,817
哦,真是出神入化
Wow,that's brilliant.

237
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,336
- Max,你真是太了不起了 - 简直难辨真伪
- Max,you've excelled yourself. - That is spot on.

238
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,779
你肯定拍卖行认不出来?
Are you sure the auction house won't spot it?

239
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,693
如果他们认出来了 mickey可以拿回那1万5千英镑
The auction house spots it,Mickey can have his 15,000 back.

240
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,528
- 一万五千美元? - 已经打对折了
- Fifteen? - Cheap at half the price.

241
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,298
如果再像这样耍花招 饶不了你
Any more stunts like that,and it won't be the dog's bollocks...

242
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,018
你小心点
that you have to worry about.

243
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,251
- 你俩要不要单独找个房间? - 干什么?
- You two want to get a room? - To do what?

244
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,219
- 我想他吃醋了 - 我可不这么想
- I think he's jealous. - Somehow I doubt it.

245
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,810
那么剩下的一万元呢
Now,what happens to the other 10,000?

246
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,458
那你就好好猜猜吧
Take a wild guess.

247
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,215
干得好,Romeo
Well done,Romeo.

248
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,419
好,接下来干什么?
Okay,what's next?

249
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,459
我要去办些事情
There are some things I need to do.

250
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,895
你干吗不送他把艺术品带回酒吧?
Why don't you take him and the artwork back to the bar?

251
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,459
"他"?我就在这儿,你知道
"Him"?I am here,you know.

252
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,292
我没有艺术品我能干吗?
What can I possibly do without the artwork?

253
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,813
是啊,你来告诉我
Yeah,you tell me.

254
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,616
我来告诉你,你干吗不跟她一块儿?
I tell you what,why don't you stay with her,yeah?

255
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,658
我去取东西
I'll go and pick the stuff up.

256
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,935
好了,看着我 我俩待一块儿,明白没有?
Okay,watch my lips.We stick together.You got it?

257
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,856
不管怎样,我可没心情听 Eddie的抱怨
Anyway,I am really not in the mood for Eddie's whining.

258
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,249
Eddie?
Eddie?

259
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,499
等等.Eddie让你找上我们的
Wait.Eddie put you on to us.

260
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,214
是Eddie?Eddie,Eddie的酒吧.是Eddie?
Eddie?Eddie,Eddie's Bar,Eddie?

261
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,695
Eddie干的,我要宰了他 我会的
Eddie did this.I'm gonna kill him,I will kill him.

262
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,295
算了吧 Eddie只是为了保住面子,跟你一样
Get over it.Eddie's just saving his skin,like you.

263
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,133
我们可跟他不同
He's nothing like us.

264
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,049
天哪,你们对于"小偷间的尊严" 看得有点过头了
God,you really overdo the whole "honor among thieves" business.

265
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,779
我的意思是,要想干有尊严的事情 那就去吧
I mean,want to do the honorable thing,go straight.

266
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,569
好主意,不是吗?真是好 出自你这种警察的嘴里
That's good,isn't it?That's good,coming from a bent cop.

267
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,137
- 我可没有搭过架子 - 那是因为你不能
- I don't pretend there's any honor in it. - That's because you can't.

268
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,575
我去查查有没有我的邮件
I'll just check if there's any mail for me.

269
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,654
你回来晚了,是吧?Max怎么样?
You running a bit late,ain't you?How's Max?

271
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,333
- 她谁? - Phillips警官

272
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,651
- Eddie出卖了我们 - Eddie?谁告诉你的?
- Eddie sold us out. - Eddie?Who told you that?

273
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,692
不可能,她在撒谎.他不会(出卖我们)
No,she's lying.He wouldn't.

274
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,848
我是说,不可能是Eddie
I mean,not Eddie.

275
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,808
这些是不是拍卖行的地图?
Are these the blueprints for the auction house?

276
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,175
就把我当作你沉默的拍档
Think of me as your silent partner.

277
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,296
你打算怎么解决闭路电视的问题?
How are you handling the CCTV?

278
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,053
每个季度都有安全系统来负责
Security system's due for its quarterly service.

279
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,810
包括闭路电视
That includes the CCTV.

280
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,649
我会搞定带子,让带子走 但不会记录下任何东西
I'll rig the tapes so they will be running,they just won't record anything.

281
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,700
这是不是用来掉包艺术品的?
Is that the modified case for switching the artwork?

282
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,215
是的,这个很好用
Yeah.It's good to go.

283
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,929
框架的后面正好跟箱子吻合
The back of the frames match the case.

284
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,896
现在,当Mickey分散大家的注意力
Now,while Mickey distracts everyone...

285
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,132
你就把箱子的另一边推进去
you press the other side of the case against the original...

286
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,138
你加紧快速的把箱子翻过来
you clip it on,you flip the case over...

287
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,491
赝品出来了,然后你就离开
the forgery releases,and off you go.

288
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,412
好的,小菜一碟
Yeah,piece of cake.

289
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,939
小菜一碟
Piece of cake.

290
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,375
保安系统就在你脚下
You will have security down on you like a ton of bricks.

291
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,859
听着,也许该由你来做
Listen,maybe you should do it.

292
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,456
好了,你们都泼我冷水 啊?我来,行吧?我能搞定的
Yeah,does everyone want to chill out,okay?I'll do it,okay?I'm going to do it.

293
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,771
- 你们管好你们自己 - 没人会为我担心的
- You just look after your end. - No one's worried about my end.

294
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,899
Mickey,也许你该给自己找个好姑娘 那所有都会改变的
Mickey,maybe you should find yourself a nice girl and all that will change.

295
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,617
给我的时间,行吧,Mickey?
Been a while,has it,Mickey?

296
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,177
是,我能说什么?我会慎重选择的
Yeah,what can I say?I'm very choosy.

297
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,736
你去下拍卖行
You need to get down to the auction house.

298
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,209
是的,我搞定了他们的闭路电视 我就打电话给你
Yeah.I will call when I've rigged the CCTV.

299
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,370
那之前,你最好别去
You don't want to set foot in there before then.

300
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,609
好好练习一下,Danny
Keep practicing,Danny.

301
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,498
下次.直接上,没问题的 这个不是问题
Next time.Go straight on,all right.It's not a problem.

302
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,492
那,分散了注意力
And distraction.

303
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,813
正如我所说的,Mickey,这个小意思
Like I said,Mickey,it is a piece of cake.

304
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,099
好吧,那我们去吧
Okay,we got to go.

305
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,696
哦,等等,稍稍奖励一下 应该不会误事的
Yeah,hang on a minute,a little bit of appreciation for that wouldn't go amiss.

306
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,089
你搞定了,我给你买个冰激凌
You pull this off,I'll give you an ice cream.

307
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,730
你在后面行吧,Mickey?够不够地方搁你的小腿?
You all right in the back,Mickey?Got enough room for your little legs?

308
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,209
- 右转 - 向右,你疯啦?应该直走
- Take the next right. - Right.You mad?It's straight on.

309
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,768
右转可以避免单行道 右转
Turning right avoids the one-way system.Take a right.

310
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,691
别听他的,亲爱的,直走
Don't listen to him,love,straight on.

311
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,575
- 老实说,我们现在哪里? - Manor路上
- Actually,where are we? - Manor Road.

312
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,373
对,哦,没错.右转
Right,yeah,it is right.Take the next right.

313
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,778
Danny,闭嘴
Danny,shut up.

314
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,140
- 我们干吗停下来? - 两分钟
- Why are we stopping? - I'll be two minutes.

315
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,179
- 干吗? - 我们来不及了
- Doing what? - We don't have time for this.

316
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,179
好吧,那这么办
Okay,here's the deal.

317
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:21,093
安全起见我们各自拿着一件艺术品
We keep one set of artwork each as security.

318
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,979
- 你在开玩笑? - 干吗不让我们跟你一快?
- Are you having a laugh? - Why don't we just come with you?

319
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,528
你们在这里等着 我来拿真品
You wait here.I will take the genuine piece.

320
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,454
如你所说,我们没有时间搞这个
Like you said,we don't have time for this.

321
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,177
好了,谢谢你
Great,thank you.

322
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,857
哪里也别想去,啊?
Weren't planning on going anywhere,were you?

323
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,454
不,我从来没有过这个想法
No,the thought hadn't even crossed my mind.

324
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,578
有没有认跟你说过你有点妄想症?
Has anyone ever told you you're paranoid?

325
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,128
有,我还要你的电话
Yep,I will take your phones,too...

326
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,531
以防你们在我背后搞小动作
just in case you were tempted to make any arrangements behind my back.

327
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,415
我会给你的,但我的意思是说
I would give it,but I mean,

328
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,852
我奶奶说过今天要打电话给我,她非常孤单
me Nan said she might call today.She gets very Ionely.

329
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,815
哦,如果奶奶打来了
Yeah,if me Nan calls...

330
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,418
就跟她说明天我会去看她
just tell her I'll come and see her tomorrow.

331
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,855
你拿到你要的东西了吗?
Did you get what you needed?

332
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,613
画还在,Danny
It's still there,Danny.

333
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:34,656
那么,你男朋友是不是在这里工作?
So,your boyfriend work round here,does he?

334
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,580
你有没有男朋友?没有?
You got a boyfriend?No?

335
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,498
怎么,你脾气不好?
What,you're more of a cat person?

336
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,130
嘿,停下里
Hey,stop them !

337
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,051
把我们的包还给我们,小偷!
Give our bag back,pricks!

338
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,895
嘿,停车!
Hey,stop that car!

339
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,095
这下好了
Great.

340
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:02,375
- 你怎么追的啊? - 好啊,我就是这么追的
- You call that running? - Yes,I call that running.

341
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,610
- 那你去哪里了? - 就在你后面
- Where were you? - Right behind you.

342
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,612
- 如果我知道你会减速 - 听着,这是我的错
- lf I knew you were going to slow down... - Look,it's not my fault.

343
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,656
- 这可不是我的错 - 当然是你的错
- Do not make this my fault. - It is your fault!

344
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,776
你让个白痴拿了箱子 这还我的错?
You let some idiot take the case and it's my fault?

345
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,498
- 闭嘴! - 我是跟着你过来的
- Shut up! - I've had it up to here with you.

346
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,333
- 你老是自做主张 - 我们现在去把它找出来
- Always got to have things your own way. - Let's sort it out now!

347
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,978
闭嘴,Danny,上车!
Shut up,Danny,and get in the car!

348
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,577
哦,这算什么意思?
Is that supposed to mean something?

349
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,538
我们刚刚搞砸了,好吗?那是真品
We just got screwed,all right?That was the real artwork.

350
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,973
我们真的要这么千方百计 要我打电话给拍卖行
Do we really have to go through the whole me phoning the auction house...

351
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,416
让我在最后一刻制止我?我想如果你们想的话,我可以这么做
you stopping me at the last minute thing?I mean,we can if you like.

352
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,809
跟你说吧,她不会这么做的
Told you she wouldn't go for it.

353
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,289
我想你没有更好的主意了
I didn't see you coming up with any better ideas.

354
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,211
你到底怎么做到的?
When exactly did you arrange it?

355
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,098
我去看邮件的时候 在旅馆留了张便条给Ash
I left a note for Ash at the hotel,when I checked my mail.

356
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,939
你不能因此怪我们吧?
You can't blame us for trying,can you?

357
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,013
哦,好吧,如果你们不这么急着摆脱我 我想我也不会这么急
Yeah,well,I'd probably be more worried if you weren't trying to ditch me,I suppose.

358
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,499
换给你
Here you go.

359
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,533
他把艺术品拿哪里了?
Where's he taking the artwork?

360
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,936
你真的以为我们不知道?
Did you really think we wouldn't find out?

361
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,569
什么?你很抱歉?哦,这太迟了,不是吗?
What's that?You're sorry?Well it's too late,son,isn't it?

362
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,019
她买了没有?
Did she buy it?

363
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,054
放了他
Let him go.

364
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,453
我说了,放他走
I said,let him go.

365
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,414
Mickey,我很抱歉 是她威胁我
Mickey,I'm sorry.She was trying to blackmail me.

366
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,417
她弄了假钞 她说我会进监狱
She planted some counterfeit money.She told me I was going to prison.

367
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,934
当我们来跟你算帐的时候 你会希望如此的
You'll wish you had when we get through with you.

368
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,020
Mickey,求求你.我们认识多久了?
Mickey,please.How long have we known each other?

369
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,932
我别无选择
I didn't have any choice.

370
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,529
Danny?
Danny?

371
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,533
上帝,Eddie,你让我有揍你的冲动
Jesus,Eddie,you're making me want to kick you.

372
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,295
我想我们还要去拍卖会
I believe we have an auction to go to.

373
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,893
他怎么办?
What about him?

374
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,976
我拿到我的钱,这就是你的事
What you do after I get my money,that's your business.

375
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,614
我们有过协议
We had a deal.

376
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,019
- 你不能这样! - 待会见,Eddie.
- You can't do this! - Later,Eddie.

377
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,099
我不小心滑了下
I slipped.

378
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,977
- 一点历史 - 它在哪儿?
- A slice of history. - And where is it?

379
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,655
今天下午晚点会到
It's not arriving till later this afternoon.

380
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,648
我已经迫不及待要看一眼了
I didn't expect to get another shot at it so soon.

381
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,857
- 你料到这么多的竞争了吗? - 都是些怪人
- Are you expecting much competition? - Only the geek.

382
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,530
Neil Davis.连环画收藏家
Neil Davis.Comic book collector.

383
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,089
纯粹是处于角色的神秘
Thinks it's all about the mythology of the characters.

384
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,614
与艺术意义完全无关
No appreciation of the artistic significance.

385
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,089
我想他甚至与无法拼出Lichtenstein
I mean he couldn't even spell Lichtenstein.

386
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,449
那一旦他得到了这么件真品 那将是巨大的悲哀
Then it would be a tragedy if he acquired such an important piece.

387
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,055
我会确保他不会得逞
I will just have to make sure that he doesn't.

388
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,052
嗨,你来了
Hi.You made it.

389
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,009
给你
Here.

390
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,852
- 你没必要这样 - 哦,我心甘情愿
- You didn't have to do that. - Yeah,I wanted to.

391
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,458
这位是谁啊?
And who's this?

392
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,889
这是鸟?飞机?不,这是
Is it a bird?Is it a plane?No,it's....

393
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,815
是Tim.跟Neil打个招呼,Tim
This is Tim.Say hello to Neil,Tim.

394
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,173
他非常喜欢自己的装扮 不肯脱下来
He absolutely loves his costume.Wouldn't take it off.

395
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,613
我希望我也有这么套行头
I wish I'd got one.

396
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,336
也许下一次?
Maybe some other time?

397
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,018
- 我们进去吧? - 好的
- Shall we go in? - Yeah.

398
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,090
他非常兴奋
He's really excited.

399
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,979
好吧,他要花些时间 那我们找个地方坐坐
Right,he'll be a while.So let's take the weight off.

400
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,489
那我们现在在看的是什么?
So,what is it we are looking at?

401
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:31,899
黑色风暴原版的封面,出品的第一版
The original artwork for the cover of Black Storm,Issue One,when it arrives.

402
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,378
所以我可以把它当作是个大买卖?
And I take it this is a big deal?

403
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,535
是的
Yeah.

404
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,930
他是第一个真正意义上的超级英雄 有着巨大的影响力
He was one of the very first superheroes.Massively influential.

405
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,970
为我们所知的后来的连环画建立了雏形
Shaped the future of comics as we know them.

406
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,859
- 噢,了不起  - 我打算竞拍它
- Wow. - I'm bidding for it.

407
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,532
那人是谁?
And who's that?

408
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,657
Gideon Sturock,竞争对手
Gideon Sturock.The competition.

409
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,449
看上去是个自命不凡的傻子
Looks like a pretentious little prat to me.

410
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,217
他自称是艺术收藏家
He calls himself an art collector.

411
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,574
他根本不顾画中的人物或神话
He doesn't care about the characters or the mythology.

412
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,292
对他来说,这不过是又一个战利品
It's just another trophy to him.

413
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,135
那我希望你别让他得逞
I hope you are not going to let him buy it,then?

414
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,858
我会尽我所能的
Not if I can help it.

415
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,208
- 那个怪人 - 真的吗?
- The geek. - Really?

416
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,049
跟他在一起的迷人女士是谁?
Who's that rather attractive young woman with him?

417
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,339
如果她和这么个没用的人在一起 大概是个妓女

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,975
我想你该试着相信我

Cole警官,Martin探员
D.I.Cole,this is D.S.Martin.

561

在过去几个月里,我打入这群人内部
I've been working the inside with this crew for the last couple of months.

562
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,935
告诉我们,你为什么要卖这件艺术品
Tell us why you put the artwork up for sale.

563
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,732
艺术专家认识他们
The art expert knew them.

564
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,459
这是让他们拿着它进来的唯一的办法
It was the only way I could get them to go through with it.

565
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,692
听着,他们的名字是 请记住这个,行吗
Look,their names are,just remember this,all right...

好了,她的身份没错,对不起
Okay.She checks out.Sorry.

568
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,575
谢谢你们,他们溜了 而我也暴露了身份
Thanks to you,they've got away,and my cover's blown.

569
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,013
我又怎么会知道?
How was I to know?

570
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,568
身份证和艺术品都有可能是假的
The ID and artwork could've both been forgeries.

571
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,218
那么,摄像头在哪里?
So,what's the scam?

572
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,976
听着,他们在展品展出的时候 把真的和假的掉了包
Look,they switched the authentic artwork for a forgery while it was on display.

573
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,332
- 我知道,那这里的闭路电视呢? - 不管用的
- I take it you have CCTV here? - Won't help.

574
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,457
Ash Morgan曾是个工程师
Ash Morgan posed as an engineer.

575
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,213
他改装过了闭路电视 所以它什么也不会录下
He rigged the CCTV,so it recorded absolutely nothing.

576
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,771
今天,我们没有请过工程师
We haven't had an engineer here today.

577
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,450
我个人授权所有的维修 如果我们有,我会知道的
I personally authorize all maintenance.I would've known if we had.

578
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,092
我们为什么不去看一看?
Why don't we take a look at it?

579
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,534
正如我所说的,它工作正常
Like I said,it's working perfectly.

580
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,769
这个男人Ash并没有离开拍卖行
This guy Ash didn't leave the auction room.

581
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,492
听着,他准备了个假身份证 我是说,我明明看见了
Look,he prepared a fake ID.I mean I saw it,so....

582
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,414
即使有了假身份证
Even with a fake ID...

583
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,890
他在闭路系统附近什么也干不了
there is no way he would've got anywhere near the CCTV system.

584
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,059
就这里,这就是他们 Mickey,那个黑人小子
There you go.That's them.Mickey,the black guy.

585
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,698
他用了个Henshaw的假名字
He was using the name Henshaw.

586
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,817
他从你哪里买到了真品,2个星期前
He bought the artwork from you,like,about two weeks ago.

587
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,330
那不是Henshaw先生 Henshaw先生是白人
That's not Mr.Henshaw.Mr.Henshaw's white.

588
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,689
11美元
One-ten.

589
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,498
也不是另外一个
It's not the other guy,either.

590
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,055
那儿,现在,我跟着他们,对吧
There,now,I follow them,okay.

591
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,012
到楼梯间的摄像头
Go to the camera in the stairwell.

592
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,809
楼梯间没有摄像头
There are no cameras in the stairwell.

593
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,331
如果闭路电视正常 你会看到他们换画
If the CCTV's working,you will see them switch the artwork.

594
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,217
没问题,他们并没有走近 黑色暴风连环画
Nope,they didn't go anywhere near the Black Storm artwork.

595
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,938
等等,你知道的,他们肯定会的
Wait,you know,they must have.

596
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,737
我能看到你在边上
I can see you near it.

597
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,856
- 现在怎么了? - 没什么
- What's happening now? - That's nothing.

598
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,291
有个孩子放了他的气球
Some kid let go of his balloons.

599
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:02,619
那么我们唯一失去图像的时候 是你站在它边上
So the only time we lose sight of the artwork,you're standing right next to it.

600
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,929
- 盒子里是什么? - 没什么,是空的
- What's in the case? - Nothing.It was empty.

601
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,490
从我为他们送了画开始我就拿着它
I still had it from when I delivered the artwork for them.

602
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,616
那么,我听说你的专家今天没来
So,I understand your own expert isn't in today.

603
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,890
Paul?不,他今天早上打电话来请了病假
Paul?No,he called in sick this morning.

604
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,650
好吧,在我检查的时候 我要你把热帽打开
Okay,I need you to turn the hot tap on in the bathroom while I check it.

605
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,774
对不起,伙计
Sorry,pal.

606
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,258
现在箱子在哪里?
Where's the case now?

607
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,817
我把它还给Mickey和Danny
I gave it back to Mickey and Danny.

608
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,700
当我们遗失画的时候Mickey 和Danny在哪里?
Where were Mickey and Danny when we lost the picture?

609
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,491
在大厅,没有靠近展品黑色风暴
In the foyer,nowhere near the Black Storm artwork.

610
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,695
你还拿着那张银行汇票,是不是?
You do still have the banker's draft,don't you?

611
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,736
是的,当然
Yeah,of course.

612
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,049
那个女人,和带气球的孩子
The woman and the kid with the balloons.

613
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,735
那么,这是什么?也许我们该去查查
So,what's this?Maybe we should check this out.

614
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,773
我还有其他证据
I've got other evidence.

615
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,214
听着,他们在骗一个地产商 这里
Listen,they were running a con on some estate agent.Here you go.

616
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,208
Richard Shaw,对吧?这就是他们骗的那个人
Richard Shaw,all right?That's the guy they were conning.

617
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,609
他可以完全解释我的话
He will totally back up my story.

618
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,017
你做不做傻瓜?这是2万5千镑
You'd have to be an idiot not to.25,000.

619
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,652
Richard Shaw地产商?
Richard Shaw.Estate agent?

620
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,819
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

621
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,539
听着,我可以带你们去 那个伪造的工作室
Look,I can take you to the forger's studio.

622
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,330
好吧,让我们来找出赝品
Okay.Let's play Spot the Forgery.

623
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,615
我告诉你们了,他们把钥匙塞给我的
I told you,they planted the key on me.

624
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,692
那为什么保险箱是以你的名字登记的?
How come the safe deposit box is registered in your name?

625
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,576
拍卖行的地图?
Blueprints for the auction house.

626
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,492
关于黑色风暴的调查
Research on Black Storm.

627
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:40,572
而这里有1万英镑
And there's got to be 10,000 here.

628
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:43,130
剩下的一万呢?
What happens to the other 10,000?

629
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,979
好好猜猜吧
Take a wild guess.

630
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,218
他们把我开到了这里
They steered me here.

631
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,178
但这是你的保险箱 是你登记的
But it's your safe deposit box.It's registered to you.

632
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:58,378
是的,但他们知道我会在 去的路上看保险箱
Yeah,but they knew I'd see the safe depository when we drove past.

633
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,653
- 老实说,我们在哪里? - Manor路
- Actually,where are we? - Manor Road.

634
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,258
哦,对,没错,右转

635
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:15,498
他们早知道我有个保险箱在这里
They must have known I had a box here.

636
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,855
那他们怎么拿到你保险箱里的东西呢?
And how would they get inside your safe deposit box?

637
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:00,413
这个假的

638
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,653
那这是什么?
What's this,then?

639

她就是那个两面派警察

她抓了Billy和他手下 到这儿来赌博,你知道
She caught Billy and his crew gambling down here,you know...

642
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,059

643
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,373
她要1万英镑,否则我就得丢执照
She wants 10,000,or I lose me license.

644

我可能一无所有,Mick
And I could lose everything,Mick.

645
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,453
- 你和我想得一样吗? - 是的
- Are you thinking what I am thinking? - Yup.

646
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,013
她漂亮吗?

647
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,373
- 好吧,我可以带你们去他们的旅馆 - 住宾馆并没有违法
- Okay,I can take you to their hotel. - It's not illegal to stay in a hotel.

648
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,497
- 是的,但我们可以搞张搜查令 - 出于什么理由?
- Yeah,but we can get a search warrant. - On what grounds?

649
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,772
Mickey和Danny并没有来卖画 是你卖的
Mickey and Danny didn't put the artwork up for sale,you did.

650
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,131
是你拿了银行支票
You collected the banker's draft.

651
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,415
就我们所知,他们也没有调包画 而你
As far as we can tell,they didn't switch the artwork,either,whereas you....

652
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,418
那是闭路电视的镜头,这是证据
There's CCTV footage,witnesses. 

653

听着,所有这一切,拍品

654
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:07,900
都是Mickey和Danny的
It's all Mickey and Danny.

655
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,096
没有任何证据表明,你跟他们说过话
There's no evidence you even spoke to them.

656
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:14,048
也没有所谓的伪造者Max 没有Richard Shaw
There's no Max the Forger.There's no Richard Shaw.

657
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,897
Mickey和Danny没有做出 任何违法的事情
This Mickey and Danny don't appear to have done anything illegal.

658
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,698
不管怎么说,至少今天没有
At least not today,anyway.

659
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,298
- 而这些从哪儿来的? - 他们设计的
- Where did all this come from? - They planted it.

660
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,690
- 是他们算计了我 - 你能证明吗?
- They are setting me up. - Can you prove it?

661
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,011
我没有选择的余地,对不起
I don't have any choice.I'm sorry.

Samantha Phillips.I am arresting you on suspicion of theft,fraud,and deception.

663

你可以保持沉默
You do not have to say anything...

664
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,618
但这将影响你的辩护 如果你对所提问的只字不提
but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned...

665
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,691
这都将会是你的成堂证供
something which you later rely on in court.

666
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:49,419
看吧,桌上的卡片
Come on,cards on the table.

667
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,295
你会不会对她粗暴点?
Would you have a little knock-about with her?

668
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,572
正如所说的,Danny,我很挑剔的
Like I said,Danny,I'm very choosy.

669
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,015
是的,但是挑剔也没什么不好
Yeah,but choosy ain't getting you nowhere.

670
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:02,775
尤其当她把警棍拿出来对着我的时候
When she got that truncheon out,did it for me.

671
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:05,814
女人是氪(你克星)
Women are your kryptonite.

672
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:09,411
你在干吗,你那是在干什么?旅游还是什么?
What are you on about,what are you on?Are you tripping or something?

673
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,968
我是他们的氪 Albert,我,听着
I'm their kryptonite.Albert,I....Listen.

674
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:16,137
- 女人对我无法抗拒 - 是的,接着做梦吧
- Women are powerless to resist me. - Yeah,dream on.

675
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,932
- 好的,我来载你们 - 不,我来开

676
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,419
让我来开
Let me drive.

677

- 要让我们干所有的事情,是不是? - 谢谢
- Want us to do everything,yeah? - Thank you.

679
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:36,691
我不想开车,行了吧?所以我骗了你,我赢了
I didn't want to drive,okay?So I tricked you,so I won.

680
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,896
你开,我不开.算了吧
You drive,I am not driving.Forget it.

681
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,619

683
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,936

686
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,658
走吧,我们回家去
Come on,let's get you home.

687
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,138
- Eddie,怎么了? - 我滑了一跤
- Eddie,what happened? - I slipped.

688
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:22,536
是的,在你来酒吧前我没时间用填充物
Yeah,I didn't have time to fit the padding before you got to the bar.

689
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,170
哦,我们什么也不能说,对吧?
Yeah,I couldn't exactly say anything,could I?

690
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,296
欺骗是个很危险的游戏,Eddie
Grifting's a dangerous game,Eddie.

691
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,099
但从好的一面来看
But look on the bright side...

692
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,648
至少Phillips警官 不会再打扰你了
at least D.I.Phillips won't be bothering you anymore.

693
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:34,331
是得,这下好了,谢谢,伙计们
Yeah,nice one.Thanks,fellas.

694
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:41,335
那我呢就去兑现了来自拍卖行的汇款
