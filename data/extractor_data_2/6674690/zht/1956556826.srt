00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,500
你在干嘛呢
Hey, whatcha doing?

24
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,850
把我們的結婚照修更好
Improving our wedding photos.

25
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,200
那挺好
Oh, that's nice.

26
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,040
等等  修完我還在里面吧
Wait, I'm still in them, right?

27
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,950
當然啦   不只是你還在
Of course. And not only you.

28
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,370
我還加進了幾個不克前來的賓客
I've added some guests who couldn't be there.

29
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,380
在我爸爸旁邊的是誰啊
Who's that next to my father?

30
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,530
萊特兄弟[發明飛機]
The Wright brothers.

31
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,570
他們為什么來了我們婚禮
And why are they at our wedding?

32
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,440
弟弟奧維爾·萊特是因為我崇拜他
Orville, because I admire him;

33
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,480
哥哥威爾伯·萊特則是弟弟帶來的伴
Wilbur, because he was Orville's plus-one.

34
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,580
你收到了一個叫丹的人給你寄的電郵
You got an e-mail from someone named Tam.

35
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,790
丹嗎  他找我想干嘛
Tam? What does he want?

36
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,760
他好像要帶他兒子來參觀加州理工
looks like he's coming to give his son a tour of Caltech.

37
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,460
他希望能跟你敘敘舊
He's hoping you guys can meet up.

38
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:40,240
他當然希望啦  可不是嗎
He would like that, wouldn't he?

39
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,320
這電郵的重點的確在此
Well, that is the gist of the e-mail.

40
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,860
丹是誰啊
Who's Tam?

41
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,700
他是我成長階段時最要好的朋友
He was my best friend in the whole world growing up.

42
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,030
真的嗎  那我怎么從來沒聽你提過他
Really? Why have I never heard you mention him before?

43
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,100
我當然有過啊   我肯定光是這周
Oh, of course I have. I'm sure I've mentioned him,

44
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,530
我就起碼提了有5次吧
like, five times this week.

45
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,910
我可不這么認為
I don't think you have.

46
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,110
丹  丹  丹  丹  丹  才周四就已經五次了呢
Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! Tam! There, it's only Thursday.

47
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,130
我不只是喝到瘋牛奶  我還買回了頭瘋牛
I didn't just drink the crazy milk, I bought the crazy cow.

48
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,470
所以你真的跟這個認識不久的女人訂婚了嗎
So, are you actually engaged to this woman you just met?

49
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:36,980
是啊
Yeah.

50
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,060
老實招來  是不是她把你肚子搞大了
Tell us the truth. Did she get you pregnant?

51
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,460
呵呵
Very funny.

52
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,990
各位  我很需要你們的幫助
Guys, I need your help, okay?

53
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,010
我想給她買個訂婚戒指
I'm trying to buy her engagement ring.

54
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,250
你覺得這款如何
What do you think of this?

55
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,350
你覺得她會喜歡這款嗎
Do you think she'll like this one?

56
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,680
很難說啊  我對她的認識那么少
Well, it's hard to say, not knowing much about her.

57
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,100
她有手指嗎
Does she have fingers?

58
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,800
有  她有十根手指
Yes, she has ten fingers

59
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,680
以及十根腳趾  應該啦
and ten toes. Probably.

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,860
等我看到她穿涼鞋我再告訴你
I'll get back to you after I see her in sandals.

61
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,940
你們知道謝爾頓小時候
Hey, did you guys know that Sheldon had

62
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,260
有一個死黨叫丹嗎
a best friend growing up named Tam?

63
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,410
是那只幻想出來的會說話的考拉嗎
Was that the imaginary talking koala?

64
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,130
不  他是個活人  貌似背叛過他
No. He's a real person who apparently betrayed him.

65
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,440
是啊  那只考拉也背叛過他
Yeah, so did the koala.

66
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,280
我試著問過他
I tried to ask him about it,

67
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,580
但他引用了婚姻協議中的第3節第5條
and he invoked section three, article five of the marriage contract:

68
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,090
"屁事  關你"
beeswax comma none of your.

69
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,330
我也不能窺探他隱私
I can't pry. I mean,

70
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,040
我得尊重他的意愿
I have to respect his wishes.

71
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,500
我真好奇那兄弟是做了什么事
Wow. I wonder what that guy could've done

72
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,160
能讓謝爾頓不跟他說話20年
to make Sheldon not talk to him for 20 years.

73
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,910
不知道我也做一次還能不能有效
I wonder if it'd work a second time.

74
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,830
我在擠母乳
I'm pumping!

75
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,110
我是佩妮
It's Penny.

76
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,430
請進
Oh. Come in.

77
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:43,760
我以為你在擠母乳呢
I thought you were pumping.

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,470
我以為你是我老板
I thought you were my boss.

79
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,820
你聽我說
Okay, listen,

80
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,180
我好擔心拉杰婚姻這件事啊
I'm really worried about this whole Raj thing.

81
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
是啊  他這么著急想結婚  也是奇怪了
I know, he's so desperate to get married, which is weird,

82
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,260
我們明明做了這么不好的示范
because I can't imagine we make it look that great.

83
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,240
就是啊
I know, right?

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
如果這女人以后會加入我們的圈子
You know, if this woman's gonna be around,

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
我覺得我們應該先去觀察她一下
I think we should check her out a little.

86
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,240
我在網上搜過  她沒有照片分享網的賬號
I looked online. She doesn't have an Instagram,

87
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,710
所以她不是80歲了就是有古怪
which means she's either 80 or something's wrong with her.

88
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,960
我可以讓我爸查查她
Well, I could ask my dad.

89
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,710
或許他可以讓他以前的警察朋友
Maybe he can get some of his old cop buddies

90
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,140
對她做一個背景調查
to do a background check on her.

91
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,890
-他會愿意嗎  -當然啦
- Would he do that? - ‭Of course.

92
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,240
他是個只按自己規矩辦事的退休警察
He's a retired cop who plays by his own rules.

93
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,220
老爸
Hi, Daddy.

94
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,270
沒  我挺好的
No, everything's good.

95
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,510
我只是有個忙想請你幫
I just have a favor to ask.

96
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,970
是這樣的  我的朋友拉杰
Yeah, so, my friend Raj

97
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,080
要娶一個他都不太熟的女人
is marrying this woman that he barely knows,

98
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,980
我想問問你能不能托關系
and I wanted to see if you could use your connections

99
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,360
挖一點她的黑料出來
to dig up any dirt on her.

100
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:26,770
沒問題
Sure.

101
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,080
好的  愛你
Okay. Love you.

102
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,660
-他愿意嗎  -不行  他不愿意  說是非法的
- Is he in? - Absolutely not. He won't do it. It's totally illegal.

103
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,430
你不是說他只按自己規矩辦事嗎
I thought you said he played by his own rules.

104
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,830
的確  但很不巧  他的規矩跟真實法律很接近
He does, but apparently, they're very similar to the actual rules.

105
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,990
真不敢相信謝爾頓有一個
I still can't believe Sheldon had a best friend

106
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,480
我們從沒聽說過的死黨
we've never heard about.

107
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,320
某人在吃醋
Ooh, somebody's jealous.

108
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,230
我才不吃醋
I'm not jealous.

109
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,710
萊納德  在這里可以放寬心  你允許脆弱  
‭Leonard, this is a safe space-- it's okay to be vulnerable.

110
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,930
我的意思只是
All I'm saying is

111
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,120
我連這家伙的如廁時間都了如指掌
you know the timing of a fellow's bowel movements,

112
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,250
怎么會想到他還那么多秘密
you don't think there's a lot left to discover.

113
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,810
真好奇丹到底做了什么
I wonder what Tam could have done.

114
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,770
如果謝爾頓不愿意談
Hmm. Well, if Sheldon doesn't want to talk about it,

115
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,480
那肯定是令他很難過的事情了
it's got to be pretty upsetting.

116
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,160
我有他哥哥小喬治的電話  他可能知道
I have his brother George's number-- he might know.

117
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,780
真的嗎  你有小喬治的電話
Really? You have George's number?

118
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,530
醋缸要滿了
So so jealous.

119
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,890
當然  我記得丹這號人物
Yeah, sure, I remember Tam,

120
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,840
謝爾頓的越南人好朋友
Sheldon's little Vietnam buddy.

121
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,780
他倆從小就一起玩
The two of them were always running around together.

122
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,080
所以發生什么事了
So, what happened?

123
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,090
什么意思
What do you mean?

124
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,010
謝爾頓從來沒提過他
Well, I mean, Sheldon never talks about him.

125
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,220
他們多年不曾聯絡  他也沒來參加婚禮
They haven't spoken in years. He wasn't at the wedding.

126
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,740
他沒來嗎
He wasn't?

127
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,740
好吧  這就尷尬了
All right. Well, this is embarrassing.

128
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,080
因為我跟一位我以為是丹的人聊了可久了
'cause I had a long conversation with someone who I thought was Tam.

129
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,710
等等  所以你不知道他們為什么而吵
Wait, wait, so you don't know what their fight was about?

130
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,340
我也希望我知道答案
I wish I could help you, boys.

131
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,240
不過你們知道嗎
But, you know,

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,840
謝爾頓小時候曾經有一個仇敵名單
Sheldon used to keep an enemies list when he was a kid.

133
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,180
他現在還留著呢
Oh, he still does.

134
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,980
真的嗎  我以為那已經和他的如廁時間表
Really? I figured that went the same way

135
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,560
同樣下場了
as his bathroom schedule.

136
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,950
如果你是指電子化  云端化并帶注釋  你答對了
If you mean digitized, annotated and put online, it did.

137
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,370
也許那上面有答案
Maybe that'll tell you something.

138
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,750
你們看的時候  如果名單還有
Hey, while you're looking at it, if I'm still on there

139
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,670
我尿在他洗發水瓶里的那件事...
for peeing in his shampoo bottle...

140
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,310
算了  留在上面吧
Eh, you know what, just leave it.

141
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,550
回見了各位
See ya, boys. Bye.

142
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,750
再見  好了  找到他的仇敵名單了
Bye. ‭All right, got his enemies list.

143
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,150
他更新了他的界面
Ooh, he updated the interface.

144
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,300
可以按姓  名
You can search by first name,

145
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,410
和怨恨的程度分別查找
last name or length of grudge.

146
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,150
丹在上面嗎
Is Tam on it?

147
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,850
找找看哈
Let's see.

148
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,340
找到了  在這里  丹·阮
Yep. Right here. Tam Nguyen.

149
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,650
太好了  他到底做了什么
Oh, great. What did he do?

150
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,150
等等  我得先同意這些服務條款
Hold on. I have to agree to the terms of service.

151
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,820
不  我不是個機器人
No, I'm not a robot.

152
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,420
好了
Okay.

153
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,320
"以下物品哪些是植物"
"Which of these are plants?"

154
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,100
成功了
And we're in.

155
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,120
好的  上面說什么
Great. What-what does it say?

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,190
那個
Well...

157
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,730
"他心知肚明自己做了什么"
"He knows what he did."

158
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,510
搞什么呀
Oh, come on.

159
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,590
等等  等等
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,

160
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,890
如果丹知道自己做了什么  我們可以直接問他
if Tam knows what he did, we can just ask him.

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,390
他明天要帶兒子來學校參觀呢
He's gonna be on campus tomorrow showing his son around.

162
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
這不會讓謝爾頓生氣嗎
Won't that make Sheldon mad?

163
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,580
任何事都能讓謝爾頓生氣
Everything makes Sheldon mad.

164
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,230
看看這名單
Yeah. Look at his list.

165
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,010
吉姆·韓生[芝麻街布偶之父]
Jim Henson for, quote,

166
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:56,460
"在電視上創造了一個又大又黃又嚇人的鳥
"Putting a terrifying, giant yellow bird on television

167
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,250
引發我噩夢連連"
and in my nightmares."

168
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,010
這里真不錯
Oh, this is so nice. Mm-hmm.

169
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,600
也許除了和安努打招呼之外
Maybe instead of introducing ourselves to Anu,

170
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,910
我們可以訂個房間
we could just get a room,

171
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,720
點些吃的  好好小睡一覺
order some food and take a nap.

172
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,390
我以前上過這種鬼話的當
Yeah, I've fallen for that line before.

173
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,010
最后絕對不是以小睡結束的
It never leads to napping.

174
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,760
那肯定是她了
That must be her.

175
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,510
她真可愛
Oh. She's cute.

176
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,060
我已幫您訂好了《漢密爾頓》音樂劇的兩張票
Okay, I got you two seats to Hamilton tonight.

177
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,200
您可以來服務臺去取票
Your tickets will be at the concierge desk.

178
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,950
不用謝
Of course. My pleasure.

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,540
有什么可以幫您的嗎
May I help you?

180
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,230
我是來取《漢密爾頓》音樂劇票的
Yes, I'm here to pick up our Hamilton tickets.

181
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,110
住嘴
Stop.

182
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,710
你好  我們是拉杰的朋友
Hi. We're Raj's friends.

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,930
我是佩妮  這位是博納黛特
I'm Penny. This is Bernadette.

184
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,960
我們想來和你打個招呼
We just came by to introduce ourselves.

185
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,660
所以你們是來打探我的嗎
So you came to check me out?

186
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,140
她好聰明  我喜歡
She's smart. I like her.

187
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,240
我們只是想看看能否約你吃晚飯
We just want to see if we could take you to dinner

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,390
多了解你一點
and get to know you a bit.

189
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,930
你們人真好  不如今晚下班后吧
That sounds nice. How about tonight after work?

190
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,160
我們可以去巴維爾餐館
Maybe we can go to Bavel.

191
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,860
我也想去呀  可那地方不可能訂到位
Oh, I wish. That place is impossible to get into.

192
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,610
拜托  我的超能力就是進各種不可能的地方
Oh, please. Getting into impossible places is my superpower.

193
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,930
我也是
Me, too.

194
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,260
我可以把自己塞進一個烘干機
I can fit my whole body in our dryer.

195
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,250
安排好了  8點半
All set. 8:30.

196
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,380
太好了  那就今晚見了
Wow. Okay, well, we'll see you tonight.

197
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,360
回見了
See you then. ‭Okay.

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,160
拜
Bye.

199
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,720
她什么餐館都能訂到位
She can get into any restaurant,

200
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,830
卻只能找拉杰做她的丈夫嗎
but the best husband she can find is Raj?

201
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:16,920
不是丹
Not Tam.

202
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,230
不是丹
Not Tam.

203
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,820
不是丹
Not Tam.

204
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:23,690
找到他了
Got him.

205
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,390
-你是丹·阮嗎  -是我
Tam Nguyen? ‭Yeah. Yes.

206
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,430
我兒子參觀完了嗎
Is my son done with his tour?

207
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,240
我不知道  我們其實是謝爾頓·庫珀的朋友
No idea. We're actually friends of Sheldon Cooper.

208
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,550
我一直嘗試在聯系他呢
Oh, I've been trying to get in touch with him,

209
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,600
但從來沒收到回信  他還好嗎
but I never heard back. Is he okay?

210
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,700
如果你是指生理上  還好
Well, if you mean physically, yes.

211
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,620
如果你是指其他方面  不好
If you mean every other way, no.

212
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,040
-他人在這里嗎  -不在
- So, is he here? - Uh, no.

213
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
他沒有來
He-he didn't come.

214
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,100
他有點...
He's, uh...

215
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,460
他還生氣呢
he's still pretty upset about...

216
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,730
你懂的
you know.

217
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,740
我懂什么
I know what?

218
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,710
就是那個呀  你肯定知道的
Come on, you-you must know.

219
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,350
我不知道呀  我們快20年沒講話了
No, we haven't talked in, like, 20 years.

220
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,790
對嘛  就是因為...
Right. Because...

221
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,830
你懂的
you know.

222
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,460
我覺得他不懂呢
I don't think he knows.

223
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,580
你們在說什么呀
What are you guys talking about?

224
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,650
你是為什么和謝爾頓鬧掰的呢
Why did you and Sheldon stop being friends?

225
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,050
-你做了什么  -別擔心
- What did you do? - And don't worry,

226
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,110
雖然我們才剛見面
even though we just met you,

227
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,240
我們覺得你是對的  他肯定錯了
we think you're right and he's wrong.

228
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,870
我什么都沒做呀
I didn't do anything.

229
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,240
他搬去加州  我們就漸行漸遠了
He moved to California, and we just drifted apart.

230
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,010
拜托  中間肯定還有些什么事...
Oh, come on, there's got to be something...

231
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,610
-你們在干什么  -嘿  謝爾頓
- What is going on here? - Oh, hey, Sheldon.

232
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,340
-我們剛見到了...  -謝爾頓  見到你真好
- We just met... - Sheldon! So good to see you!

233
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,090
丹
Tam.

234
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,900
好久不見了
It's been a long time.

235
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,750
并沒有久到讓背叛的傷痛灰飛煙滅
Mm, not long enough to erase the sting of betrayal.

236
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,270
我怎么背叛你了
How did I betray you?

237
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,970
你知道自己做了什么
You know what you did.

238
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,930
我給你劇透一下
Uh, let me catch you up.

239
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,840
他真心不知道
He does not.

240
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,200
當我搬到加州時  你做了什么
When I moved to California, what did you do?

241
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,340
我留在德州了啊
I stayed in Texas.

242
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,390
你們看看這貨
Do you believe this guy?!

243
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,050
所以他是你小時候的死黨嗎
So, he was your best friend growing up?

244
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:54,800
是的
Yes.

245
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,320
你們德州是沒有其他小朋友了嗎
Were there no other kids in Texas?

246
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,240
你這人到底怎么回事
Hey. What is going on with you?

247
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,730
我不想聊這件事
I don't want to talk about it.

248
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,770
你一定有一個足夠蠢的理由
Well, I'm sure you have a perfectly stupid reason.

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,950
我才不會為了蠢理由做什么事
I don't do anything for a stupid reason.

250
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,810
除了"學海盜說話日"
Except, perhaps, Talk Like a Pirate Day,

251
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,050
但我覺得那是滑稽多過蠢
and I'd argue that's more whimsical than stupid.

252
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,600
我之前想搞清楚丹做錯了什么
You know, I was curious to find out what Tam had done wrong.

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,170
結果他根本什么都沒做  而我一點都不意外
Why am I not surprised the answer is nothing?

254
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,930
這么說你站在他那邊了
So you're taking his side.

255
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,130
你個壞血病爛狗
You scurvy dog.

256
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,130
{\an8}壞血病又稱水手病  主要由缺乏維生素C導致

257
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,500
你給我小心點  我的敵人名單現在有空位了  
You watch yourself. There is room on my enemies list

258
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,950
因為食堂的阿姨們終于告訴我
now that the cafeteria ladies finally told me

259
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,130
辣椒醬里放了什么了
what's in the chili.

260
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,840
順便說下  別吃那個辣椒醬
By the way, don't eat the chili.

261
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,660
等一下  其實呢
Wai-Wai-Wait, you know what?

262
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,500
吃吧
Do.

263
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,550
小心點  謝爾頓
Be careful, Sheldon.

264
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,150
你承受不了失去第二個死黨
I don't think you can afford to lose a second best friend.

265
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,520
我可沒看到有人要排隊當你第三個死黨
I don't see anyone lining up to be your third.

266
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,630
等一下
D... Wait.

267
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,870
搜索"回懟金句"
"Snarky comebacks..."

268
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
找到了
Oh, here we go.

269
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,590
"你這輩子都是混球
"You have your entire life to be a jerk,

270
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,290
休息一天也無妨吧"
why not take today off?"

271
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,820
這句挺刺耳的  不過是他自找的
That was harsh, but he was asking for it.

272
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,430
這地方太贊了
This place is amazing.

273
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,910
真不敢相信你給我們訂到了位子
I can't believe you got us in here.

274
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,560
這算是我的工作
Well, it's kind of my job.

275
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,520
通常客人會有小費  但我就讓你們自己決定吧
Usually I get tipped for it, but I'll leave that up to you.

276
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,190
快看  那個好像是勒布朗
Look, I think that's LeBron over there.

277
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,270
球星詹姆斯嗎
James?

278
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,000
不然是詹姆斯·路人甲嗎
No, LeBron Kershenbaum.

279
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,860
你們想知道什么
So, what do you want to know?

280
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,930
你看起來是個聰明成功的女性
Well, you seem like a smart, successful woman,

281
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,310
你為什么會想跟一個剛認識的人結婚
why would you want to marry someone you just met?

282
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,710
問得好
Fair question.

283
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,200
我二十幾歲時  試過普通的戀愛方式
In my 20s, I tried this the normal way.

284
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,310
遇到了一個男人  墜入愛河
You know, met a guy, fell in love,

285
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,620
然后我們同居了
we moved in together.

286
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,210
我供他上烹飪學校  編劇課程
I put him through culinary school, screenwriting classes,

287
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,260
最后在他想當助產士時把他甩了
and finally dumped him when he wanted to become a midwife.

288
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,640
然后我意識到
Then I realized,

289
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,460
我父母很幸福  他們就是包辦婚姻
my parents are happy; they had an arranged marriage.

290
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,270
我為什么要抗拒這個
Why am I fighting this?

291
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,400
我也說不好  我為愛而結的婚
I dunno, I married for love

292
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,330
結果也...
and it turned out...

293
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,460
還行
fine.

294
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,850
我的也是
Oh, yeah, me, too.

295
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,910
你好
Hi.

296
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,790
霍華德  今天你走運了
Howard, today is your lucky day.

297
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,640
萊納德出局了  現在你是我新任死黨
Leonard's out, you're my new best friend.

298
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,420
我也不為此感到激動
Well, I'm not thrilled about it either,

299
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,500
不過就這樣了
but here we are.

300
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,100
好吧
Okay, fine.

301
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,440
伯納黛特在嗎
Is Bernadette there?

302
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,720
不在
Sh... No.

303
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,090
只有斯圖爾特
Just Stuart?

304
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,520
我等會再打給你
Let me call you back.

305
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,870
讓我猜猜
Let me guess.

306
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,530
丹的事嚴重性升級
This thing with Tam escalated,

307
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,790
現在你生萊納德的氣了
and now you're mad at Leonard

308
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,500
要找新一任死黨
and looking for a new best friend?

309
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,980
你好了解人家
You know me so well.

310
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,940
可惜你不能當我死黨
It's too bad you can't be my best friend.

311
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,010
我可以啊
I can be.

312
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,330
你不能同時當我的妻子和最好的朋友
You can't be my wife and my best friend.

313
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,030
不然我要跟誰抱怨你的事
Who would I complain about you to?

314
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,850
告訴我發生什么了
Just tell me what happened.

315
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,600
萊納德背著我去找丹聊了  還站在他那邊
Leonard talked to Tam behind my back and took his side.

316
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,720
他可是對我做出過那么過分的事  你能相信嗎
And after what he did to me. Can you believe it?

317
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,550
不能  我很震驚  也很憤怒
No. I'm-I'm shocked and outraged.

318
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,180
現在告訴我  我為什么震驚和憤怒
Now, tell me why I'm shocked and outraged.

319
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,340
好吧
Fine.

320
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,110
當我被加州理工的研究所錄取時
When I got accepted to grad school at Caltech,

321
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,300
我很害怕要搬到離家這么遠的地方
I was afraid to move so far away from home.

322
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,530
于是丹說他會跟我一起搬出來
So Tam said he'd move out here with me

323
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,780
做我的室友
and be my roommate.

324
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,470
然后在暑假期間  他找了個女朋友
Then, over the summer, he got a girlfriend,

325
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,020
即使他已經看完我給他的
even after reading all the pamphlets

326
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,080
那些介紹性病的小冊子
I gave him about social diseases.

327
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,470
我記得你給過我那些小冊子
Aw, I remember when you gave me those pamphlets.

328
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,730
總之  丹陪她留在了德州
Anyway, Tam stayed with her in Texas,

329
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,220
我只能獨自搬來這里
and I had to move out here all by myself.

330
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,060
你當時一定很害怕
That must've been scary.

331
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,690
是的
It was.

332
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,380
我很孤單寂寞
I was lonely, and I thought

333
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,060
心想我再也交不到朋友了
I'd never make a friend again.

334
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,140
有很長一段時間  我確實沒交朋友
And for a long time, I didn't.

335
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,040
但之后你交到了
But then you did.

336
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,740
還是很棒的摯友
And great friends.

337
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,240
你想想  如果當初丹跟你一起搬來
If you think about it, if Tam had moved out here with you,

338
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,750
誰知道你的生活會變成什么樣子
who knows what your life would've been like.

339
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,520
什么事
Yes.

340
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,980
我是萊納德·霍夫斯塔德  
Uh, I'm Leonard Hofstadter.

341
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,080
{\an8}第3季第22集

342
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,080
我在電話里說想租你的公寓 你說...
I called you about the apartment. You said...

343
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,340
叫他滾蛋  你已經有室友了
Tell him to go away. You already have a roommate.

344
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,410
新來的鄰居
New neighbor?

345
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,410
{\an8}第1季第1集

346
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,370
你們好呀
Oh, hi.

347
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,490
-你好  -你好
- Hi. - ‭Hi.

348
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,600
-你好  -你好
Hi. ‭Hi.

349
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,080
丹  快看啊
Tam, look.

350
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,680
謝爾頓在擁抱我
Sheldon's hugging me.

351
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,680
{\an8}第2季第11集

352
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,750
這是農神節的奇跡
It's a Saturnalia miracle.

353
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,530
謝爾頓  出來
Sheldon, come here.

354
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,530
{\an8}第3季第14集

355
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,450
逗你玩
Bazinga.

356
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,140
不  我的生活還是會很棒
No, my life would've still been great.

357
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,320
客人提過最瘋狂的要求是什么
So what is the craziest request anyone's ever made?

358
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,170
其實我不能說
Oh, you know, I can't really say.

359
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,210
禮賓部和客人之間有保密協議
Concierge-guest confidentiality.

360
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,560
不是吧  真有這回事
Really, that's a thing?

361
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,100
沒有
No.

362
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
有一次  我得在凌晨三點到沃爾瑪去
This one time, I had to go to Walmart at 3:00 a.M.

363
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,480
因為歌手小甜甜布蘭妮想吹泡泡
because Britney Spears needed to blow bubbles.

364
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,510
好酷啊
Oh. ‭That is so cool.

365
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,300
對了  千萬別告訴拉杰你見過小甜甜布蘭妮
By the way, do not tell Raj that you met Britney Spears,

366
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,120
因為他會激動到原地去世
because he will literally die.

367
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,250
我們聊了很多我的事了
We've been talking so much about me,

368
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,420
跟我說說拉杰吧
tell me about Raj.

369
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,810
你是想把我們灌醉
Okay, are you trying to get us drunk

370
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,440
讓我們大聊朋友的八卦嗎
so we'll dish on our friend?

371
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,590
效果卓越  你想知道什么
'Cause it's totally gonna work, what do you want to know?

372
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,530
他是什么樣的人
What kind of guy is he?

373
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,860
他是好人
He is great.

374
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,120
非常好的人
So great. ‭

375
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,580
那他為什么還單身
How come he's still single?

376
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,150
-他是好人  -非常好的人  沒錯
- He's great. - ‭So great. Yeah.

377
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,840
少來
Come on.

378
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,160
真的沒什么可說的
There's really nothing to tell.

379
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,650
和拉杰在一起玩非常開心
Raj is so much fun to hang out with.

380
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,050
他像我們的閨蜜
He's like one of our girlfriends.

381
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,800
我這話是褒義
And I mean that in a good way.

382
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,030
但也是貶義
But also a bad way.

383
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,980
還有嗎
Anything else?

384
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,920
-沒了  -沒了
- No. - ‭No.

385
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,860
他和他的狗一起洗澡
I mean, h-he takes baths with his dog,

386
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,310
但并不是以奇怪的方式
but not in a weird way.

387
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,720
也不是正常方式  他們都穿泳衣
Or a normal way; they both wear swimsuits.

388
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:40,660
每次休·杰克曼唱歌他都會哭
He also cries every time Hugh Jackman sings.

389
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,440
不是梨花帶雨嬌美狀  而是一把鼻涕一把淚
But not cute sniffles-- full-on snot sobs.

390
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,260
但他真的很好
But he is great.

391
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,550
-太好了  -沒錯
- So great. - ‭Yeah.

392
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:54,030
你好  謝爾頓
Hello, Sheldon.

393
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,410
你好  丹  感謝你來
Hello Tam. Thank you for coming.

394
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,840
我只想讓你知道
I just want you to know that, um...

395
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,060
我原諒你
I forgive you.

396
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,030
我什么都沒做
I didn't do anything.

397
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,270
但我依然愿意
And yet, here I am,

398
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,760
做大度的那個人
still being the bigger man.

399
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,340
聽著  我當時愛著貝絲
Look, I was in love with Beth,

400
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,460
她令我開心
and she made me happy.

401
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,520
是嗎
Y... Really?

402
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,760
她讓你玩她的火車模型嗎
Did she let you play with her train set?

403
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,070
可以說她讓我"玩她的"
In a manner of speaking.

404
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,960
謝爾頓  我需要留在德州
Sheldon, I needed to stay in Texas.

405
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,600
你需要來這里
And you needed to come here.

406
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,510
我知道你會有出色的成績
I knew you were gonna do amazing things,

407
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,960
會認識尊敬你的出色的人
and meet amazing people who were gonna respect you,

408
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,100
因為你才華橫溢
because you're brilliant.

409
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,850
也因為他們永遠不必從大垃圾箱中把你撈出來
And because they never had to fish you out of a dumpster.

410
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,140
還是撈過的  那時候
Well, they have, but it was during

411
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,950
我短暫地迷上了跑酷
my short-lived parkour phase.

412
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,630
我不是有心讓你生氣
I didn't mean to upset you.

413
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,570
我想讓你知道  對于你的成績
And I want you to know I'm really proud

414
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,190
我非常驕傲
of everything you've done.

415
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,650
謝謝你
Thank you.

416
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,740
我的日子的確過得不錯
It did work out for me.

417
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,020
很遺憾你的日子過得不好
And I'm sorry that things didn't work out for you.

418
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,820
我也過得很好啊
They did work out for me.

419
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,430
丹  你不必因為我偽裝堅強
Oh, Tam, you don't need to be brave on my account.

420
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,220
我沒有
I'm not.

421
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,100
我有出色的妻子和孩子
I have a great wife and amazing children.

422
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,440
我非常快樂
I'm very happy.

423
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,470
堅強  堅強的丹
Brave, brave Tam.

424
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,310
似乎佩妮和伯納黛特昨晚玩得很開心
Sounds like Penny and Bernadette had fun last night.

425
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:10,850
我知道
I know.

426
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,390
妮妮回家時很醉了
Bernie came home pretty drunk.

427
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,330
她還想睡在烘干機里
She tried to sleep in the dryer.

428
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,330
你們都認識丹  我在高中時的死黨
Hello, you all remember Tam, my best friend from high school.

429
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,690
-當然  -你好嗎
- Yeah. ‭Of course. ‭- How's it going?

430
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,540
謝爾頓帶我和我兒子到處參觀
Sheldon's been showing me and my son around.

431
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,490
現在我們知道了所有干凈的衛生間在哪里
Now we know where all the clean bathrooms are. ‭

432
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,250
你要善用記憶法
You just remember the mnemonic:

433
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,950
小號小號  圖書館讓你笑
if it's number one, the library's fun,

434
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,100
大號大號  地下室剛剛好
if it's number two, the basement's for you.

435
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,950
我很高興你們和好了
I'm glad you guys made up.

436
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,410
我意識到我的生活很幸福
Well, I realized my life turned out great,

437
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:40,110
記仇太傻了
and it's silly to hold a grudge.

438
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,550
我根本不知道我們吵架了  所以和好很容易
And I had no idea we were fighting, so it was easy.

439
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,050
別擔心  萊納德
Uh, don't worry, Leonard,

440
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,080
你依然是我的加州死黨
you're still my California best friend.

441
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,820
酷
Cool.

442
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,940
你現在想做什么
So, what do you want to do now?

443
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,260
去火車玩具商店  還是漫畫書店
Go to the train store, go to the comic book store?

444
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,850
其實我要帶兒子去機場了
Actually, I have to grab my son and head to the airport.

445
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,420
我正準備叫出租車
I was just about to call a cab.

446
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,690
別傻了  你不用叫出租車
Don't be silly, you don't have to call a cab.

447
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,040
你是我交情最老的朋友
You're my oldest friend.

448
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,790
萊納德會送你的  對嗎  萊納德
Leonard will take you. Right, Leonard?

449
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,140
當然
Sure.

450
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,610
可以走了嗎
Shall we?

451
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:10,490
慢著慢著
Eh, eh, eh, hold on.

452
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,180
我20年沒見丹了
I haven't seen Tam in 20 years,

453
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,750
給我一個機會道別
give me a chance to say good-bye.

454
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,580
拜
Bye.

455
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,030
你看
Check it out--

456
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,470
勒布朗·詹姆斯在網上發了我和他的合影
LeBron James posted a picture of me and him on Instagram.

457
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,730
我沒看到你
I don't see you.

458
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,840
在他后面
Look right behind him.

459
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,180
沒看到
No.

460
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,700
你看到他左肩后的桌子嗎
Okay. You see that table just past his left shoulder?

461
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,210
再過去兩桌  看右邊
Now go back two more tables and over to the right.

462
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,490
我只看到一塊黃斑
All I see is a yellow smudge.

463
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,660
那是我
That's me!

464
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,540
是拉杰
Oh, it's Raj.

465
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,760
拉杰  我和佩妮在一起
Hey Raj, I'm here with Penny.

466
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,560
你們對安努亂說了些什么
What the hell did you two say to Anu?

467
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,830
你這話是什么意思呢
Whatever do you mean?

468
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,950
你們為什么告訴她
Why, why would you tell her

469
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,980
我用女士體香劑
I wear ladies' deodorant?

470
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,020
因為你是男人  很好玩啊
Uh, because you're a boy and it's really funny.

471
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,250
好吧  請原諒我
Oh, oh, okay. Pardon me

472
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,200
能有身上帶雛菊飄香的自信    
for having the confidence to smell daisy-fresh.

473
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,180
幫我個忙  離她遠一點
Just do me a favor and stay away from her.

474
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,380
老天  現在我覺得好內疚
Ugh, God, now I feel bad.

475
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,570
是啊
I know.

476
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,740
也許我們應該再和她出去
Maybe we should take her out again

477
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,190
說些拉杰的好話
and do some damage control.

478
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,760
這是個好主意
You know, that's a good idea.

479
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,690
你覺得她能把我們搞進蘇荷館嗎
Think she can get us into SoHo House?

480
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,580
不知道  但我們欠拉杰人情  必須試試
I don't know, but we owe it to Raj to try.
