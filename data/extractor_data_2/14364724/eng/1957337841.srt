356

deems useless.

357
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,618

right?

new sheets.

364
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,383
I need breakfast.

365
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:10,177
And I, lunch.

366
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,595
[Declan] She sounds great.

367
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,222
Do you have a photograph of her?

368
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,683
No. Now, why would I do that?

369
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,601
We were connecting. It was real.

370
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,603
Why would I just take
her photograph?

371
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,689
So I could see her.
What about her socials?

372
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,649
- Has she got
a Facebook account?
- I don't know.

373
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,484
- Insta?
- I don't know.

374
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,488
- Can you find out?
- I don't know her second name.

375
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,240
Why don't you text her?

376
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:33,951
I don't have her number
or her email or her address.

377
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,161
So how are you gonna contact
this woman?

378
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,705
I'm not.

379
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,416
We arranged to meet
on the Galway train on the 28th

380
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,167
two weeks from now.

381
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,169
That is so fuckin' romantic.

382
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,546

385

I was thinking.

386
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,847
[exhales] Oh...
I fucking love this.

387
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,849
- She's never gonna show.
- How do you know?

388
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,268
Because you only met her on
the train for, like, two hours.

389
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,353
Of course she is.
It was a deep connection.

390
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,689
She's not gonna show.
Trust me. She's a lady.

391
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,775
She's gonna wake up and forget
a little bit more about you

392
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,986
each day, and meanwhile,
you'll do the opposite.

393
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,071
This is why God invented
phone numbers.

394
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,658
To keep reminding her of you
again and again.

395
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,784
It's military.

396
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,036
You needed to close the deal.

397
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,081
You've never been
a deal closer, Michael.

398
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,875
And sadly, that has
always been the difference

399
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,210
between me and you.

400
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,796
- [Jane] Hmm.
- I think he's actually

401
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,548
in advertising,
but he calls it "tech."

402
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,550
You sure about this guy?

403
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,093
I know. On paper,
I kind of hate him.

404
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,803
But it doesn't matter.

405
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:35,805
Oh, bless.

406
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:38,432
I feel like there's
so much pressure

407
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,767
around compatibility these days,

408
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,769
and all we have
to have in common,

409
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,812
but what about the benefits
of incompatibility?

410
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,564
[Declan] If you don't have
her phone number,

411
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,232
how are you gonna do
some sexting?

412
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,734
I don't want to do some sexting.

413
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,944
- She's a modern woman.
- Isn't that the whole point

414
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:53,071
- of having a mobile phone,
though?
- Yes.

415
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,365
That's the entire reason
they were invented: sexting.

416
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,326

not some teen hookup

419

Eh, I'll be the judge of that.

420
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,373
What's she studying?

421
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:05,126
- She's a medievalist.
- Okay.

422
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,169

she's gonna be there.

542
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,913
This was so right.

543
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,665
I know she feels the same way.

544
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,291

You can't break the two K, dude.

548
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,549
I'm sure you'll
bump into her again.

549
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,968

- Yeah, I can't rely on that.

- I get it,

553

Special? Special how?

It seems like

Anyway, it's my own fault

You didn't think you'd need to.

It's totally romantic.
It's wonderful.

564
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,249
You relied on your connection.

565
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,375
It's sheer poetry.

Sheer poetry?

[Declan] It's amazing
how you tech liberals

568
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,464
are always the ones
to break the rules.

569
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:30,260
They start out
all disruptive and cool,

570
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,762
and then it's like, "Oh,
but we don't want to pay taxes,

571
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,306
and we don't want to give
our workers

572
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,558
their rights, 'cause we're
just a scrappy little startup

573
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,560
that started over a pizza shop,

574
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,645
and the rules don't apply to us
now that we have the wealth

575
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,272

Also, I can't believe

Top right of the cupboard.

581

You've never followed
a rule in your life.

582
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,829
It's not just a rule,
it's common sense.

583
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,247
It's about caring
for your neighbor

and not just yourself

585
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,251

you want to be in.

586
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,128
This is real life, Michael.

587
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,088
Exactly. It's my life.

588
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,216
You are literally one step away

589
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:12,135
from: "It's a free country,
and I can do what I want."

590

But it is.

591

- It's my life. I only get one.
- No, it isn't.

592
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,226
It's our life,
and we're all in this together.

593
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:21,811
And for the first time,
the world might actually unite.

594
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,688
But you're more interested
in what happened

595
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,274
to some girl who you met
on a train for half an hour.

596
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,360
There's millions of them, man.
They're just girls.

00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,527
Yeah, not this girl.

wasn't even that special.

601
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,869
You know?

602
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,080
His facial hair was
kind of annoying.

603
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,082
And he works
in a business I loathe.

604
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,417
He sounded wonderful.

605
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,294
Lots of people are wonderful.

606
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,630
What if he shows up
and you don't?

607
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:49,631
You'll never know.

608
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,174
He's not gonna show up, Mum.

609
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,634
He's a really responsible
type of guy,

610
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,011
and he's not just gonna
flout the rules

611
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,429
for someone like me.

612
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,390
But I need to know
how this turns out.

613
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:00,684
I've got bets
with all the neighbors

614
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:02,686
on whether he'll show up.

615
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,853
What?

616
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,314

on tenterhooks.

[Declan] This isn't about you!

00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,193
It's about the world
coming together!

619
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,028
You saw the Gal Gadot video.

620
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,030
Hell, we all saw it
and we all cried.

621
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:18,535
Listen to Gal Gadot
and her celebrity mates.

622
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:19,995
This'll pass
and get back to normal,

623
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,496
and I'll be on my own again.

624
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,164
I'll be damned if I'm gonna miss

625
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,125
this one chance
at something real

626
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,585
because of some temporary rules.

627
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,838
This woman was incredible.

628
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,214
I haven't spent a minute

629
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,174
not thinking
about everything she said.

630
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,635
If she shows up and I don't,

631
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,721
I'll never forgive myself.

632
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,556
It'll-it'll haunt me.

I'm not gonna
physically stop you, dude,

636
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,690
but don't ask my blessing.

637
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,984
You do what you want.

638
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:53,611
Anyway, she's not gonna show.

639
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,906
Wanna bet?

640
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,658
No.

641
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,660
Okay, this is my actual life
we're talking about,

Mm-hmm.
