1
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,430
Woman over walkie-talkie:
They're coming up on
vinton and 20th now...

2
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,265
Check over that way,
would you?
Will do.

3
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,867
...heading over to salvage
and recycling.

4
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,473
Man over walkie-talkie:
Copy that. I'm about 5 out.

5
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,645
You see a guy
in a corduroy coat go by?

6
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,314
Sir?

7
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:37,316
Sir.

8
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,352
Young guy, dark hair,
corduroy coat.

9
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,726
How about it?

10
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,402
Hey, Nick.
Come here.

11
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,573
Wanna come on
out here?

12
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,750
Go ahead and open
your jacket for me.

13
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,657
I'm placing you
under arrest, sir.

14
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,592
Put your hands
on your head, please.

15
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,000
Nick, you want
to grab those for me?

16
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,535
Nick:
You got it.

17
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,009
All right, let's go.

18
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,878
Nice job.

19
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,314
Say nothing, you understand?!
Get a lawyer!

20
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,024
Get a lawyer.

21
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,027
Asshole.

22
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,672
Ladies.

23
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:07,873
Sam:
Hey, gene.

24
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,408
Raquel:
Nice lunch?

25
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,710
Oh, yeah.
Whatcha need?

26
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,046
Rolls about
to come out.

27
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:15,814
You got it.

28
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,460
Jimmy: So, can I, uh,
tell Howard

29
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,362
you're not quitting
or retiring or whatever?

30
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,532
And can we take all this shit
down off the walls?

31
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,637
I'm gonna go call Howard.

32
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,072
Jimmy.

33
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:18,810
You do realize
you just confessed to a felony?

34
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,812
I guess.

35
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,482
But you feel better,
right?

36
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,717
Besides,
it's your word against mine.

37
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,523
Ohh!

38
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,691
Ugh!

39
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,562
Jimmy: Absolutely.

40
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:11,763
Coming back.

41
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,866
What's it matter
what I said, Howard?

42
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,535
Why you lookin' a gift horse
in the mouth?

43
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,136
He just --

44
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,173
yeah, well, whatever it was,
he's over it now, all right?

45
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,942
And by the way, you're welcome.

46
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,221
Well,
Howard's breathing again.

47
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:38,623
You made him
very happy.

48
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,752
Jimmy!

49
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:09,187
Jimmy,
if you're gonna help,

50
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,590
a-at least use a little finesse,
would you?

51
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:12,791
"Finesse"?
Whaddya...

52
00:08:12,793 --> 00:08:14,092
Would --
quit yanking at it.

53
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,595
You're -- you're pulling
the varnish

54
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,063
right off the walnut.

55
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,764
Not pullin'
any varnish off the walnut.

56
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,800
You most certainly are.
Look. Look! See?

57
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,569
Well, maybe you shoulda thought
about the friggin' walnut

58
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:26,238
before you covered it
in duct tape.

59
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,006
I don't need
your help!

60
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,242
I don't recall
ever asking for it.

61
00:08:30,244 --> 00:08:31,977
I'm sorry,
okay?

62
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,946
Finesse, fine.
Show me. Demonstrate.

63
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,715
Like this.

64
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:38,183
Gently...

65
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,521
...roll it
with your thumbs.

66
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,789
Left,
and then right.

67
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,157
See?

68
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,628
Alternate the thumbs,
up and down.

69
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,664
Get a nice,
tight roll going.

70
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:54,699
Chuck,
i think you're the one

71
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,234
that needs a nice,
tight roll.

72
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,938
Come on.
Show me.

73
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,139
Gently.

74
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,641
Gently.

75
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,009
Left,
then right.

76
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,644
Left, right.

77
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:08,813
I get it.
Wax on, wax off.

78
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,549
Mr. miyagi.

79
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,551
"Karate kid."

80
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,756
Seriously?

81
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,202
Oh, my god.

82
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,004
"The adventures of Mabel."

83
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:35,907
I-i haven't thought about this
in forever.

84
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,842
You remember this,
Chuck?

85
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,177
I do.

86
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,314
Harry thurston peck.
Yeah!

87
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:44,282
Mabel goes
into the mountain,

88
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,851
and she meets
the king of the brownies,

89
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,186
and he gives her...

90
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,189
Some kind of
super delicious jelly and...

91
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,993
Holy crap.
1912.

92
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,228
Yeah. Belonged to
grammie Davenport.

93
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,030
She wrote her name
in it.

94
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,333
She was reading that
to her schoolkids

95
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:03,768
the year
the Titanic went down.

96
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,970
Damn.

97
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:07,172
And mom
read it to me.

98
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,174
<i> I</i> read it
to you.

99
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,876
You don't remember.

100
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,211
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,713
I do,
now that you say it.

102
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,114
Yeah.

103
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:20,118
What was I --
like 5 or 6?

104
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,723
You had
this weird night-light

105
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,725
that you were
so crazy about.

106
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,226
It was, um...

107
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,362
It was daffy duck!

108
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:32,864
It was some daffy duck rip-off
with this weird red bill.

109
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,899
Mouth. Oh, yeah, yeah,
the bill. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

110
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:37,402
And it used to get so
hot, we thought it would
burn the house down, but --

111
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,671
Right.
...You wouldn't
let anybody touch it.

112
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:42,941
Yeah, that's a --
you got a great memory, Chuck.

113
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,143
That red bill
and everything.

114
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,911
Hey.

115
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,179
What was the name
of that little girl

116
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,882
that lived, uh,
three houses up from us?

117
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,785
She had, like,
a pageboy haircut.
Jimmy.

118
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,054
And she was always in the dirt,
always dirty.

119
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,255
Jimmy!
I liked her.

120
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:59,424
She was always --
Jimmy.

121
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:03,795
Don't think I'll ever forget
what happened here today.

122
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:14,039
And you<i> will</i> pay.

123
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,457
You didn't mention
my garden.

124
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,060
Well, your garden
is part of your backyard,

125
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,961
so it's automatically
included

126
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,430
in the property
that goes to jenn.

127
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,066
It comes
with the house, mom.

128
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:44,469
Well, I think you need
to mention it by name

129
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:48,306
in case some dirty judge
decides to play tricks.

130
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:51,176
Okay,
we can do that.

131
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:55,313
Let's see.
Garden.

132
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,483
Hey, I'm back.
Oh, hi, ladies.

133
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,884
Jimmy mcgill.

134
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,186
Hey, Jimmy.
We are almost done here.

135
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,854
Great.
Can I, uh...

136
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,055
We're almost done.

137
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,124
I'll be with you
in a minute.

138
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,465
Oh.

139
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:16,067
And mention
my Lily pond.

140
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,337
It's in my garden.

141
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,740
Lily pond.

142
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,519
Kim:
Okay, ladies.

143
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,187
Jenn: Thanks so much
for your help.

144
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,455
Oh,
you're very welcome.

145
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,090
Thank you both
for being so patient.

146
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,792
And, Mrs. aherne,
if you or Margaret

147
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,894
ever need anything from me --
anything at all --

148
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,195
you can call me
day or night.

149
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,865
This is Mrs. siemasko
and her daughter jenn.

150
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,967
I'm sorry. I got my wires
crossed a little.

151
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:50,168
Uh...
Bye.

152
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,369
Mrs. siemasko: Bye.
Drive safe.

153
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,372
Thank you.
Okay, thank you.

154
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,042
You are
a superhero.

155
00:12:58,044 --> 00:13:00,779
I owe you big-time.

156
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:13,191
So, how's Chuck?

157
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,393
Crisis averted...

158
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,995
I guess.

159
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,497
I mean, he's back to being
the same old Chuck, so...

160
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:24,002
Wanna talk about it?

161
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,403
Depends.

162
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,138
It may
or may not involve

163
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,241
that thing you said you never,
ever wanted to discuss.

164
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,911
Um.
Okay, then, thanks.

165
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,112
I gotta
get back to it.

166
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:35,413
How 'bout
we call it a day?

167
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,948
I'll buy you
some dinner.

168
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,250
You're kidding,
right?

169
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,252
You realize
how far behind I am?

170
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,521
Not to mention now I've got
eight entire wills to finish up.

171
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,256
Whaddya talking about?
I'll do the wills.

172
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,091
No, you won't.
'Course I will.

173
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:49,060
Do the wills.
They're<i> my</i> clients.

174
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,261
They're<i> my</i> clients.

175
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,529
You and I aren't partners,
remember?

176
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,198
Once I take
these people on,

177
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,166
I can't just reassign them
to you.
Aw, c'mon.

178
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,268
Why you getting all,
like, legal on me, huh?

179
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,304
Who cares?

180
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,940
Look, I told every single
one of them the situation --

181
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,575
that they'd be getting me
instead of you.

182
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:06,077
I tried to talk them all
into coming back another day.

183
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,112
Six of 'em left.
Maybe you'll get those back.

184
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,148
I mean, look, if this is about
the money, I have --

185
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,116
it's not about the money.
You can keep the money.

186
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,419
Don't act
like I<i> wanted</i> this.

187
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:17,021
Jesus, like I need more
on my plate.

188
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,598
Are you mad?

189
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,033
I'm not mad.

190
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:33,037
I'm just, uh...

191
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,041
...thinking about things.

192
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:47,118
For 10 minutes today,
Chuck didn't hate me.

193
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,389
I forgot
what that felt like.

194
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,249
Chuck:<i> Jimmy.</i>

195
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,555
<i> You do realize</i>
<i>you just confessed to a felony?</i>

196
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,658
Jimmy:<i> I guess.</i>

197
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,027
<i> But you feel better,</i>
<i> right?</i>

198
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,364
<i> Besides,</i>
<i>it's your word against mine.</i>

199
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,500
That's the end of it.

200
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:37,535
Howard?

201
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,170
That's the end.
Mm.

202
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:43,975
Could you...?

203
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,944
Oh, yeah.

204
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:52,550
Well, now do you
believe me?

205
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:57,121
I don't even know
where to begin.

206
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:59,657
But yes,
i believe you.

207
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,461
Your brother is one
world-class son of a bitch.

208
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,697
No offense.

209
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:10,401
I just -- I really wish
you'd told me

210
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,570
about these plans of yours
before you went out and did it.

211
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:15,239
I know, Howard,
and I regret misleading you.

212
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,342
It's just that
a certain...

213
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,577
<i> Vérité</i>
had to be established.

214
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,079
I'm not talking about
the heart attack

215
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,981
that you nearly
gave me.

216
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:24,482
Chuck,
this tape --

217
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,418
I'm not sure
exactly what it accomplishes.

218
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,388
Look, you know evidentiary rules
better than I do,

219
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,256
but a secretly
recorded tape

220
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,725
with a problematic
chain of evidence?

221
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,461
You're gonna have a helluva time
getting that admitted.

222
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,029
I agree.

223
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,263
And if you somehow put it
in front of a jury,

224
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,631
Jimmy'd call
a dozen audio experts,

225
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,100
say that voice
isn't his,

226
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,568
say the -- the tape
had been edited.

227
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,103
He would, indeed.

228
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:46,304
Are you thinking about
playing this

229
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,206
for Kevin wachtell
at mesa verde?

230
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,041
Because as much
as I would love to,

231
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,342
that ship has sailed.

232
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,578
We're never getting them back,
regardless.

233
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,381
Oh, I doubt we could even
get in the door over there.

234
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,017
Chuck, if that tape is useless
in a court of law

235
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,285
and no help
in the court of public opinion,

236
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:02,553
what's the point?

237
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,223
Because I can't think of
a single use for it.

238
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,592
<i> I</i> can.

239
00:21:54,747 --> 00:22:00,351
hey, mister,
we're closin' in 15 minutes.

240
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,659
Call me a cab,
will ya?

241
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,397
What about
your vehicle?

242
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,835
Keep it.

243
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,572
Man: Five j's
auto salvage.

244
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:26,577
Broadway, uh,
at -- at Bobby foster's.

245
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:30,915
Yeah, ehr-- ehr-- ehr--
how is it again?

246
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,550
Ehrmantraut.

247
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:34,618
Yeah, ehrmantraut.

248
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,920
Yeah.

249
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:40,524
Just tell him
to pull up to the gate and honk.

250
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,960
Okay, yeah.
Thanks.

251
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,463
They're on their way.

252
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,099
Thank you.

253
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:38,449
you sell a gas cap
for an '87 caprice wagon?

254
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:39,884
Should.

255
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:43,754
Gm caps should be in the blue
on the bottom there.

256
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:27,525
Torrent downloaded from RARBG

257
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,811
Now, you're sure
i can't help you

258
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,012
carry those to your car,
Mrs. vankamp?

259
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,680
Don't be a silly.

260
00:26:56,682 --> 00:26:58,215
I only hope I didn't take
too much of your time

261
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,017
with all my
dusty old photos.
Goodness, no.

262
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,885
Your -- your grandson's wedding
was gorgeous.

263
00:27:01,887 --> 00:27:03,687
When I come back,

264
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:05,089
I'll show you
my niece's confirmation.

265
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:06,857
Wait'll you see
the flowers!

266
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,058
Ohh!

267
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,259
Roses.
Uh-huh.

268
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,894
Petunias, orchids.
Yeah.

269
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,730
They don't smell,
you know?
Well...

270
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:14,632
And baby's breath
and bachelor buttons.

271
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,133
Okay.
Lilies of the valley.

272
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,968
Well, I'll believe it
when I see it.

273
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,903
Daisies --
daisies don't tell.

274
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:21,739
Now I've got something
to look forward to.
Okay.

275
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,073
Okay, bye-bye.
Bye.

276
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,742
See ya!

277
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:28,912
Uh, thank you
for waiting so patiently.

278
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,981
Who do we have next?

279
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,321
That'd be me.

280
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,826
Hello, hello.

281
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,162
It's so good
to see you again.

282
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,799
I escorted you and your clients
onto my base.

283
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:52,102
I treated you
with hospitality and respect,

284
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,404
and now
i come to find

285
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:55,272
every word out of your mouth
is a damn lie.

286
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:56,774
Captain, please.
Why don't -- sit down.

287
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:58,108
Take a load off.

288
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,377
Hey, I'll get you
a complimentary coffee

289
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,912
or a soft drink?

290
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,014
And your so-called war hero,
"fudge" talbott?

291
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,716
No such person --
never was.

292
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,252
Granted, some artistic license
may have been taken.

293
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,854
You entered government property
under false pretenses, sir.

294
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:12,056
Whoa, whoa.

295
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,791
I am no expert
on your procedures

296
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,225
and your protocols
and whatnot,

297
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,728
so if -- if we failed to
cross a "t" or dot an "i,"

298
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,297
I sincerely apologize
for any misunderstanding.

299
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,899
N-no, no, no, it's not
a misunderstanding!

300
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,300
Just step back!
B-big picture this, okay?!

301
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:24,802
It --
what damage was done?!

302
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:26,036
Hey,
who was hurt, huh?

303
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:27,337
What was damaged?

304
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,839
The -- the base
is still there, right?

305
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,340
The b-52 is,
i presume, still --

306
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,176
b-29.
Huh?

307
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:35,045
B-29.
Fifi's a b-29.

308
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,347
I don't...

309
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,184
Oh, this is all just
one big joke to you, huh?

310
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:42,152
You don't like
the commercial.

311
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,454
No, no, I don't,

312
00:28:43,456 --> 00:28:45,022
but this has nothing to do
with the comm--

313
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,490
well, constructive criticism
is always welcome.

314
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:48,192
But I didn't --
but you should realize

315
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:50,327
that most people find it
uplifting -- patriotic, even.

316
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,296
No.
You check
your recruiting numbers.

317
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,431
I-i-i --
i think you're gonna see
an uptick, and you know what?

318
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,734
If it turns out that fudge
wasn't actually in the war --

319
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,936
fudge is not a person.
He<i> wasn't</i> in the war.

320
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:00,404
Well,
neither was tom cruise,

321
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,006
and look what "top gun" did
for you.

322
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:06,343
You lied to me,
you lied to my face,

323
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:08,045
and I can't let you
get away with it.

324
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,346
I-i think we just --

325
00:29:09,348 --> 00:29:11,849
we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree,

326
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:14,384
so, uh, can I get you
that coffee to go or...?

327
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,254
No, no.<i> I-I'm</i> gonna tell<i> you</i>
what's happening now.

328
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,490
You're gonna take that ad
off the air.

329
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,024
And if you play that ad
one more time,

330
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,826
I'm gonna go
to the judge advocate,

331
00:29:22,828 --> 00:29:24,228
and we will
take you down --

332
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,996
trespassing,
false representation,

333
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,865
stolen valor --
the whole nine yards.

334
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,867
Seriously, for eight seconds
of a TV commercial?

335
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,036
You take that ad down,
or there'll be hell to pay.

336
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,038
That clear enough
for you?

337
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:39,009
Make me.

338
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,277
Yeah?
Yeah.

339
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,146
Make you?
Yeah, let's do this.

340
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,881
You bring
your commander down here,

341
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,216
and I'll explain to him
how you let us on the base,

342
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,418
red-carpet treatment.
No, b-because you lied
your way in.

343
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,287
Not how
i remember it.

344
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,790
What happened --
and I've got witnesses
to back me up.

345
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,491
Do you like being
an air force captain, huh?

346
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,260
You think
the United States

347
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:58,195
wants to bring action against
an old man in a wheelchair?!

348
00:29:58,197 --> 00:30:00,531
He was standing on TV.
He wasn't even in a wheelchair!

349
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,999
Well, yeah.

350
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:03,200
Well, periodically,
he is.

351
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:04,802
And when he shows up
in court,

352
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,436
you better believe
he'll be in a wheelchair!

353
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,905
Right, because you're an
ambulance-chasing piece of shit,

354
00:30:07,907 --> 00:30:09,540
'cause you're all
the same --

355
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,008
you're the same
as all the others.
Always on a high horse.

356
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,977
Always trying to make me
feel like I'm --

357
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:22,920
look, um,
I'm a lawyer,

358
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:25,088
and this is what I do
all day, every day,

359
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,557
so h-how about this?

360
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,026
I-i won't
fly jet planes --

361
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,261
you, uh,
stay out of court.

362
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:33,330
Does that sound good?

363
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:39,469
You know,
guys like you --

364
00:30:39,471 --> 00:30:43,440
you think
you're so damn smart,

365
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:47,244
and you think you don't have to
play straight with anybody.

366
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,079
The wheel
is gonna turn.

367
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:52,182
It always does.

368
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,598
"A lawyer
you can trust."

369
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,366
My ass!

370
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:14,204
Thank you
for your service!

371
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:27,604
3:30 in the morning?
Seriously?

372
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30,140
You get me that?

373
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:36,680
I don't know.

374
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,451
It's a real thing?
Yeah.

375
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:43,587
Then, yeah.
I know someone who can get it.

376
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,122
How much?

377
00:33:45,124 --> 00:33:46,723
What do I look like --
radioshack?

378
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,725
It's gonna cost you
whatever it costs me,

379
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:50,293
plus my end.

380
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:51,661
Well, let's start
with that.

381
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,298
Normally,
be about $500,

382
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,503
but seeing that this is
an after-hours house call,

383
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,772
let's make it
a grand.

384
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,152
Hey,
how's the pup?

385
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,720
Doing okay?

386
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,057
Yeah.

387
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,392
She's not being left alone
all day, is she?

388
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,828
She's got
plenty of company.
Good.

389
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,332
Hey, uh, this is gonna
take me a few days,

390
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,334
so I'll let you know.

391
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:33,136
And next time,

392
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:37,741
let's try to make business
happen during business hours.

393
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:14,644
Mm-hmm.

394
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:19,549
Well, this will certainly help
my Thursday powerpoint.

395
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,285
Excellent.

396
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,389
That's a draft letter from Kevin
to the Arizona regulator.

397
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,126
I know he likes
the personal touch.

398
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,394
He's gonna love it.

399
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,864
Oh, I can't believe you did
all of this in three days.

400
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,234
Am I reading this right --

401
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:38,869
did you get the rehearing
moved up?

402
00:35:38,871 --> 00:35:41,304
Yeah. Those are
three possible dates,

403
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,406
pending your
and Kevin's schedule.

404
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:45,575
The soonest I could get
is the 4th.

405
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,377
You moved it up
almost three weeks.

406
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,746
I'll give it another shot
and see if I can do better.

407
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,749
Are you kidding me?

408
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:56,586
Kevin'll be
popping champagne!

409
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:58,555
I knew
you were the right one for this.

410
00:35:58,557 --> 00:36:00,357
Well, I appreciate
the opportunity.

411
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,360
Yeah, you should have heard
how that arrogant jerk

412
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,728
spoke to me
at the hearing.

413
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,830
Right there,
in front of Kevin,

414
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:09,466
he accuses me
of muddying the waters --

415
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:12,235
muddying...The...Waters.

416
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,436
I mean,
he's the one

417
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:16,473
who can't even
get the address right.

418
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,408
Yeah, that's --
wow.

419
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,310
I know you have friends
over at hhm,

420
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,445
and they sure talk a good game,
but come on.

421
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,948
Guys like that,
when crunch time comes,

422
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:27,484
it's always
someone else's fault.

423
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,921
Paige?

424
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,690
I'm sorry to interrupt.
It's almost 11:30.

425
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,859
Thanks, Greta.
I'll be right up.

426
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:38,461
So, are we still on
for lunch Tuesday?

427
00:36:38,463 --> 00:36:39,963
Kim:
Absolutely.

428
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,299
And, Paige, thank you...
For everything.

429
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,733
Paige:
No, thank you

430
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,802
for cleaning up that mess
mcgill left behind.

431
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,538
Actually, would you mind
if I messenger that over

432
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,940
tomorrow morning,
first thing?

433
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:51,942
I'd like to take one last look
before we submit,

434
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:54,411
just double-check
a few things.

435
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:57,480
Sure.
So, tomorrow, first thing?

436
00:36:57,482 --> 00:36:58,882
Absolutely. Thanks.

437
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,718
I'll see you,
Paige.
Okay, bye.

438
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,255
[Telephone ringing in distance,

439
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,665
How's it coming
in there?

440
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:51,835
Good!

441
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,408
Don't mean
to rush ya.

442
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,377
No, it's okay.

443
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,283
I'm done.

444
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,027
Half a rainbow?

445
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:18,495
Don't you want
to keep going

446
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,729
till you do
the whole thing?

447
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,399
No.
If you're done, I'm done.

448
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:25,702
You know, your clients
seem to like that rainbow.

449
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,937
Think they're gonna miss it?

450
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:30,407
Wait till they see
what's going up next.

451
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,409
They're gonna love it.
<i>You're</i> gonna love it.

452
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,577
Yeah?
Should I be worried?

453
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,579
Nope.

454
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,048
Whaddya say
we get the hell outta here?

455
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,750
Sounds good.

456
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,054
Mm.

457
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,043
You ready ta hit it?

458
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,778
Sorry. I just need
to check one thing.

459
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:13,583
It'll be two minutes,
tops.

460
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,516
Chuck: Ernesto.

461
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,551
Morning,
Mr. mcgill.

462
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,986
They didn't have
fuji apples,

463
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,721
so I got you honeycrisp.

464
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,857
Hope that's all right.
I'm sure
it'll be fine.

465
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,492
Um, did you get the,
uh...

466
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,993
Yeah.
I got them.

467
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,728
I went ahead and, um --

468
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,897
I figured
i should maybe...

469
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,139
I wrapped them up --
you know, for safety.

470
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:10,840
That's very thoughtful
of you,

471
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,443
but I need them now,
so, if you...

472
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:15,745
You sure it's okay?
It's okay.

473
00:40:22,521 --> 00:40:23,787
Um.

474
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,588
Yip.

475
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:37,066
Perfect.

476
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:38,935
Ah.

477
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,012
Shit!

478
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:09,466
Ahh.

479
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:15,238
Ernesto,
could you come in here, please?

480
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,076
Thought
i could do this myself.

481
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:23,179
Uh, would you mind, uh,
changing the batteries?

482
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:24,581
Sure thing,
Mr. mcgill.

483
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,583
Yeah.

484
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,985
Thanks.

485
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,593
Jimmy:
<i>I changed 1261 to 1216.</i>

486
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,895
<i> It was me.</i>
Turn that off!

487
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,630
Turn it off!
Jimmy:
<i>It all went down exactly --</i>

488
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,098
turn it off!

489
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,733
Aah!

490
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:47,136
You did not hear that!

491
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:53,109
All right.

492
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:54,911
Okay, Ernesto...

493
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:58,681
That'sss my fault,
not yours.

494
00:41:58,683 --> 00:42:00,984
Um, but now that
you've heard it,

495
00:42:00,986 --> 00:42:03,520
you need
to understand something.

496
00:42:03,522 --> 00:42:06,055
You know
about confidentiality, right?

497
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:09,158
As employees
of Hamlin, Hamlin, mcgill,

498
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,761
you and I are both bound
by the strictures

499
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:13,263
of client confidentiality --

500
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:15,265
by law, both of us --
by law.

501
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,534
You understand
what I'm saying?

502
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:19,769
So I'm not
supposed to tell anyone?

503
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:22,071
That's right,
no matter who,

504
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:25,775
no matter what reasons
you think you might have,

505
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:28,811
you must not --
you<i> cannot</i> tell anyone.

506
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,748
There could be
terrible consequences --

507
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,716
life-changing consequences.

508
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:37,587
And we don't want you
to get into trouble.

509
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:41,090
If something were to happen
to you because of this,

510
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,093
I'd feel sick about it.

511
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,264
Okay.
Enough said.

512
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,832
I guess...

513
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,168
I'll go finish
puttin' away the groceries.

514
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,570
Okay?

515
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,172
Thank you,
Ernesto.

516
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,032
Hmm.

517
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,501
<i> Highs for Tuesday --</i>

518
00:46:11,503 --> 00:46:13,402
