1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:02,523
Previously on Young Sheldon...

2
00:00:02,525 --> 00:00:05,717
Well, we've covered
football and grandkids...

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,953
Maybe we've run out
of stuff to talk about.

4
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:09,654
We forgot about your ex-husband.

5
00:00:09,656 --> 00:00:12,216
The one you're dating.

6
00:00:12,218 --> 00:00:15,227
Well, I know not to piss
him off during a hailstorm.

7
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,162
Well, did he tell you that I was naked

8
00:00:17,164 --> 00:00:18,296
when he locked me out?

9
00:00:18,298 --> 00:00:19,998
What were you doing naked

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,167
with a golf club in a hailstorm?

11
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,036
Ah, you know, it was the '70s.

12
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:27,639
I was just calling to let
you know I read your paper.

13
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:29,708
The masses for your
neutrinos are impossible.

14
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,845
I completely rewrote the
whole thing from scratch.

15
00:00:33,847 --> 00:00:36,538
I know credits are usually
listed alphabetically,

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,984
but I'm completely fine
with my name going second.

17
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:41,786
I'm not putting your
name on it in any way.

18
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:44,823
- Grant Linkletter.
- Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work

19
00:00:44,825 --> 00:00:46,958
and is using it in his own paper.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,028
How dare you accuse me of plagiarism!

21
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,240
I don't want to see
you in my class anymore.

22
00:00:55,736 --> 00:00:57,970
I see, Dr. Sturgis.

23
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,641
Yes, that is unforgivable behavior.

24
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:05,277
Okay. Bye.

25
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,493
Did he apologize?

26
00:01:06,495 --> 00:01:08,801
No. He is very upset with you.

27
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:10,448
Well, I'm upset with him.

28
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,552
That doesn't excuse you from trying

29
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:15,186
to get him in trouble by
calling Dr. Linkletter.

30
00:01:15,188 --> 00:01:17,188
Who else was I supposed to tattle to?

31
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,324
I doubt his mother's still alive.

32
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,638
Sheldon, I understand why you're upset,

33
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,195
but you still owe him an apology.

34
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:26,097
Then you don't understand.

35
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,124
Well, for now, it sounds like you two

36
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:30,702
could use a little quiet time.

37
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:33,462
Fine. I'll switch over
to Dr. Linkletter's class.

38
00:01:33,464 --> 00:01:34,990
He's a foot taller than Sturgis

39
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,644
and can reach more of the chalkboard.

40
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,810
What I meant was...

41
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:42,280
maybe it's time to take a
break from your college classes.

42
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:44,649
What? Why? I've gotten straight As.

43
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:46,918
I know you're smart enough for college.

44
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,155
I'm just not sure you're mature enough.

45
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:52,891
Well, it appears you've
backed me into a corner.

46
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,732
I would throw a tantrum right now,

47
00:01:54,734 --> 00:01:58,029
but that would just prove your point.

48
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,331
Where are you going?

49
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:01,196
To play with my trains.

50
00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:05,001
Which may sound immature, but
it's a hobby many old men enjoy.

51
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:24,122

52
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,896
I'm the only cheerleader
you should be looking at.

53
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:34,699
Oh. Hi. Oh, I was trying to find you.

54
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:37,258
- Just wanted to wish you a good game.
- Thank you.

55
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,193
- I'm gonna be cheering for you.
- Great.

56
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,172
Unless I catch you
looking at someone else.

57
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:42,474
Then you'll regret it.

58
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:45,845
I'm not kidding.

59
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:48,980
Hi, George.

60
00:02:48,982 --> 00:02:51,149
Oh, hey, Ms. Hutchins.

61
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,785
I don't think I've ever
seen you at a game before.

62
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:56,586
Well, uh, it's Friday,
and I promised my therapist

63
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:59,547
- I'd try one new thing a week.
- And you picked football.

64
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:00,592
Good for you.

65
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:02,894
I don't suppose Sheldon's here?

66
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:05,864
Nah, he doesn't much
care for outdoor sports.

67
00:03:05,866 --> 00:03:07,399
Or sports.

68
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:09,034
Or the outdoors.

69
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:11,469
I was hoping I'd have
someone to sit with.

70
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:13,505
- Ah, sorry.
- That's okay.

71
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:16,708
It was my fault for
letting myself feel hope.

72
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,577
You're welcome to watch
from the sidelines.

73
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,832
Thanks. Watching life
go by from the sidelines

74
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,939
is kind of my thing.

75
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,776
Hey, heads up!

76
00:03:30,857 --> 00:03:33,191
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

77
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:34,626
I don't think so.

78
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:36,161
Call an ambulance.

79
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:37,696
Don't worry,

80
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,030
we're gonna get you taken care of.

81
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:43,135
If I die, tell my therapist I hate him.

82
00:03:44,054 --> 00:03:45,076
And who says

83
00:03:45,078 --> 00:03:46,867
you have to be mature to go to college?

84
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:48,339
I've seen Animal House.

85
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,508
- You have?
- Well, I've seen the poster.

86
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,111
Those people are not college material.

87
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,380
Moon Pie, I know you
don't like to hear this,

88
00:03:55,382 --> 00:03:57,716
but there are some things in life

89
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,851
that can only be learned in time.

90
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,120
So you must have learned them all, huh?

91
00:04:02,122 --> 00:04:04,657
Get out of my house.

92
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,960
Hang in there. I'm hangin'.

93
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:12,009
Hey, this will be quite a story
to tell your grandkids, huh?

94
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,531
I live alone. I'm single.

95
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:15,667
I don't think grandkids
are in the picture.

96
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,870
Oh. Well, I... I got
a wife, kids. It's...

97
00:04:18,872 --> 00:04:21,656
It's overrated.

98
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:22,981
And then my mother said

99
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:24,778
I wasn't mature enough for college.

100
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,211
Can you believe that?

101
00:04:26,213 --> 00:04:27,679
Absolutely.

102
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:29,347
So you're on their side, too?

103
00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:31,382
I'm Vietnamese. In my culture,

104
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,751
until your parents die,

105
00:04:32,753 --> 00:04:34,986
- you're basically a baby.
- Really?

106
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:37,689
My grandmother still
treats my dad like a child.

107
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,291
At dinner, he can't sit until she sits,

108
00:04:40,293 --> 00:04:42,727
and he can't speak until he's spoken to.

109
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:44,863
Well, I'm glad I'm not Vietnamese.

110
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:46,898
It's not as fun as I make it look.

111
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,233
Mm.

112
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:51,836
Well, you can't bring her
home to an empty apartment.

113
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,505
Bring her here, and we'll look after her

114
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,000
until she's back on her feet.

115
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,915
- You sure?
- Of course.

116
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:58,610
We'll set her up in Georgie's room.

117
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:00,411
Thanks, Mare. See you in a bit.

118
00:05:00,413 --> 00:05:01,980
Hey, George.

119
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:05,583
It's real nice of you,
taking care of her like this.

120
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:07,519
Well, it was kinda my fault.

121
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:09,487
Kinda? It was all your fault.

122
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:11,256
Bye.

123
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,657
Hey.

124
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:14,859
Hey. How'd we do?

125
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:16,861
- You didn't miss anything.
- That bad?

126
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:19,531
I can safely say you saw
the best hit of the night.

127
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:21,299
Whew.

128
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:22,600
How's she doing?

129
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,669
Well, not bad.

130
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,709
Could be worse.

131
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:28,740
A little whiplash,

132
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,942
couple of bruised ribs,

133
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,443
broken arm...

134
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,245
and collarbone.

135
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,780
But that's it.

136
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:37,515
Pretty funny how you
jumped out of the way

137
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,583
and let her get clobbered.

138
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,039
I did not jump out of the way!

139
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:41,352
Oh, yeah, you did.

140
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,054
They got you on tape.

141
00:05:43,056 --> 00:05:44,088
Okay, fine.

142
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,624
But that was pure instinct.

143
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:49,994
Besides, she shouldn't have
been standing on the sidelines.

144
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,497
Why was she there?

145
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,965
I told her she could.

146
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,900
Oh, man, you must feel terrible.

147
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,302
Yeah, of course I do.

148
00:05:57,304 --> 00:05:59,437
I mean, it's all on you.

149
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,905
You done?

150
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:04,710
Oh-ho-ho, baby, I'm
just getting started.

151
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,415
Oh, you poor dear. Come on in.

152
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,922
Thanks. I hope I'm not putting you out.

153
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:14,153
Of course not.

154
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:16,754
Hi, Sheldon.

155
00:06:16,756 --> 00:06:20,059
Can you believe my mother
said I can't go to college?

156
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:26,575
So you just put her in my
room without consulting me?

157
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,876
Consulting you?

158
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,311
Who cares what you think?

159
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:30,637
Well, I ain't gonna sleep on the couch.

160
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,014
It's just for a few nights

161
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,749
until she can take care of herself.

162
00:06:33,751 --> 00:06:35,918
Can I at least stay at Meemaw's?

163
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,886
If you promise not to come back.

164
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,222
Why you got to be so mean to me?

165
00:06:40,224 --> 00:06:42,491
It just feels right.

166
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,350
And then after Dr. Sturgis
incorporated my math,

167
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:49,265
he refused to give me a coauthor credit.

168
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,034
Sheldon, she doesn't
want to hear about that.

169
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,168
It's okay.

170
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,928
So, when your bones broke,
did you hear a crunch?

171
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,252
No.

172
00:06:57,254 --> 00:07:00,345
- Did my dad have to give you mouth-to-mouth?
- No.

173
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:03,482
I don't know how my mom kisses him.

174
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:06,615
Next up, we have this rose..

175
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:09,184
Who buys this crap?

176
00:07:09,186 --> 00:07:10,986
Me, after three beers.

177
00:07:10,988 --> 00:07:13,289
I mean, look at this damn thing.

178
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,424
What was I thinking?

179
00:07:18,162 --> 00:07:20,229
Can I ask you a personal question?

180
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:21,664
You're not in my will.

181
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,365
It's about my girlfriend.

182
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,466
Uh-oh.

183
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,701
Uh, nothing bad.

184
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,237
It's just, I've been
seeing Jana for a while now,

185
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,005
and I like her fine...

186
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,509
but it feels like she's getting
more serious than I want to be.

187
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,412
Georgie, until you're married,

188
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,079
you are not tied down to anybody.

189
00:07:39,081 --> 00:07:41,083
You just go ahead and
do whatever you want.

190
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,485
Play the field. Have some fun.

191
00:07:43,487 --> 00:07:45,020
Interesting.

192
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:47,657
That's what Dale said, too.

193
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:49,925
Oh, did he?

194
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,660
Yeah.

195
00:07:51,662 --> 00:07:53,529
My boyfriend?

196
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:55,231
Yeah.

197
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:58,067
If I don't go

198
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,902
to college, what am I supposed to do?

199
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:01,860
Spend all my days in high school?

200
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:03,218
How sad is that?

201
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,643
Pretty sad.

202
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,368
You always did get me.

203
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,793
Sounds like you're
feeling misunderstood.

204
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,597
I am... by Dr. Sturgis, my mother,

205
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,517
and possibly the entire
Vietnamese culture.

206
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:20,289
Do you understand that I'm in
a little bit of pain right now?

207
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,225
Oh, I'm sorry. I should
be exhibiting compassion.

208
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:24,360
Aw.

209
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,061
Wait, I can do better.

210
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:27,296
Aw.

211
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,731
Nailed it.

212
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,165
It's time for your pain pill.

213
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,415
Be careful. You could become addicted

214
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,469
and lose your job.

215
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,570
Which is all you have.

216
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:36,773
Get out of here.

217
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,141
Thank you.

218
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,510
You-you comfortable?

219
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,190
Can I get you anything else?

220
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,647
No. I-I'm okay.

221
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:49,041
You've been so kind to
welcome me into your home.

222
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:50,419
Well, it's the least we could do.

223
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:54,357
It's so nice to be
around a family like this.

224
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:58,264
I've been alone

225
00:08:58,266 --> 00:09:00,963
for... so long.

226
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:04,166
Honestly, if it weren't for
the cats, I'd have no one.

227
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,468
Oh, wait. The cats!

228
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,637
I abandoned Edgar and Allan.

229
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:10,093
Edgar and Allan?

230
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,740
Poe ran away.

231
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:14,309
Would you please go feed them
and tell them I love them?

232
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,613
Uh... any chance this
could wait till morning?

233
00:09:17,615 --> 00:09:19,916
I guess.

234
00:09:21,746 --> 00:09:23,068
Where you off to?

235
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,587
Cats!

236
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:27,627
So you think he's seeing somebody else?

237
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:29,886
I don't think I should
be talking about this.

238
00:09:29,888 --> 00:09:33,028
- He's my boss.
- Well, he's my boyfriend, so spill it.

239
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,465
It's weird when old
people say "boyfriend".

240
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,401
Fine. My lover.

241
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:40,602
Well, that's worse.

242
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:41,770
Then talk!

243
00:09:41,772 --> 00:09:44,106
The only woman I've really seen him with

244
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,642
- is his ex-wife.
- Oh, yeah, but he hates her.

245
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,477
Don't seem like it.

246
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:50,979
What do you mean by that?

247
00:09:50,981 --> 00:09:53,882
- They seem friendly.
- How friendly?

248
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,352
- I don't know. He's nice to her.
- How nice?!

249
00:09:57,354 --> 00:09:59,822
Do you mind? I'm trying to watch this.

250
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,490
Now look at this little guy...

251
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:11,733
Son of a bitch!

252
00:10:11,735 --> 00:10:13,101
Here! Edgar! Or Allan.

253
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,703
Whichever the hell one you are.

254
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:16,138
They ever leave the store together?

255
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,163
Can I please just go to bed?

256
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,375
Just answer the damn question.

257
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:22,779
I feel like I'm gonna
get fired for this.

258
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:24,012
Georgie, don't worry.

259
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,982
Anything you say is
gonna stay right here.

260
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:28,617
But you lie all the time.

261
00:10:28,619 --> 00:10:30,219
I learned to lie from you.

262
00:10:30,221 --> 00:10:32,221
See what a special bond we have?

263
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:34,457
Now answer the damn question!

264
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:41,230
Why were you gone for so long?

265
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,233
I don't want to talk about it.

266
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,012
- Whoa.
- What's that?

267
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:56,749
It's a ghost detector
that came in my cereal box.

268
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,806
It's just a piece of paper.

269
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:02,898
Then why did it move in my hand?

270
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,366
From perspiration.

271
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:05,534
Or ghosts.

272
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,504
Mornin'.

273
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:09,905
Did you check on Ms. Hutchins?

274
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,373
Is she still alive?

275
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,442
Of course she is. Why?

276
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,177
No reason.

277
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:17,012
I'm gonna go eat my breakfast with her.

278
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,914
Sheldon, just let her rest.

279
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,082
It's okay. She enjoys my company.

280
00:11:21,084 --> 00:11:23,952
Also, she understands what I'm
going through with Dr. Sturgis.

281
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:25,120
Excuse me.

282
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:27,054
I am just trying to help you grow up

283
00:11:27,056 --> 00:11:28,757
to be a functional adult.

284
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,660
Me? This one's looking
for cereal ghosts.

285
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,162
Looking for and found 'em.

286
00:11:33,164 --> 00:11:35,664
I don't care. You are
not ready for college.

287
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:39,735
If it were up to you, I'd
still be in grade school.

288
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:43,639
If you think this is
mature behavior, it isn't!

289
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,678
Being a mom's hard, isn't it?

290
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,714
Sometimes.

291
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,516
If you ever want to talk about it,

292
00:11:54,518 --> 00:11:55,551
I'm here for you.

293
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:57,187
Ooh, it's moving again.

294
00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:00,289
You're so lucky.

295
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,425
You're gonna have to
walk me through that.

296
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,541
Well, you don't have anyone
in your house telling you

297
00:12:05,543 --> 00:12:07,296
what you can or can't do.

298
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:08,696
Right, Sheldon.

299
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,365
I don't have anyone.

300
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,481
I just said that.

301
00:12:11,483 --> 00:12:13,802
Are you becoming a drug addict already?

302
00:12:13,804 --> 00:12:14,970
Mornin'.

303
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:18,474
Got you some Shipley's
Do-Nuts and coffee.

304
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:20,375
What happened to your face?

305
00:12:20,377 --> 00:12:21,643
Oh. Uh...

306
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,679
either Edgar or Allan.

307
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,095
Oh, that was Edgar.

308
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:27,431
He can be a rascal.

309
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:32,754
Good mornin'.

310
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:34,556
Mornin'.

311
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:36,391
Did you sleep good?

312
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:37,693
Yeah.

313
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:39,495
Want some pancakes?

314
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:40,696
Sure.

315
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,664
Just one more question about Dale.

316
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:43,765
Bye.

317
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:52,310
There we go.

318
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:53,842
Nice little bite-size pieces.

319
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,230
Thanks, George,

320
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,812
but I-I think I can manage.

321
00:12:56,814 --> 00:12:58,147
No, no. My pleasure.

322
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,079
He feels so guilty, he'll
do anything you ask him.

323
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:02,642
- That's enough from you.
- He bought me

324
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:05,077
an Easy-Bake Oven when he
closed the car door on my thumb.

325
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:06,740
Unlike my mother, who feels no guilt

326
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:08,624
after hurting her children.

327
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:09,869
How dare you.

328
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,562
I am trying to keep you safe

329
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:13,862
until such a time as you
can make adult decisions.

330
00:13:13,864 --> 00:13:16,282
- I can make them now.
- Hey, hey. We have a guest.

331
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,200
Let's pretend like we like each other.

332
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,803
Mare, do your grace thing.

333
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,672
♪ I love the melody... ♪

334
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:25,340
You okay with Mexican?

335
00:13:25,342 --> 00:13:26,701
Oh, yeah. Terrific.

336
00:13:26,703 --> 00:13:27,709
All right.

337
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:30,012
Now, I got Tums in the
glovebox for the ride home.

338
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,447
Great.

339
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:34,816
So, you talk to June lately?

340
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:38,220
Uh, not in a couple of days. Why?

341
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:39,488
Oh, no reason.

342
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,256
I was just kind of thinking
about calling her myself.

343
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,192
I mean, if you're okay with that.

344
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:46,072
You want to call my ex-wife, go ahead.

345
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,162
Call her.

346
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,464
Well, I wouldn't want
you to feel uncomfortable.

347
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,799
Yeah, you would.

348
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:51,867
Yeah, I would.

349
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:53,702
I think it's nice

350
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:55,437
that y'all get along as well as you do.

351
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:56,872
Mm-hmm.

352
00:13:56,874 --> 00:13:58,626
Where are we going with this?

353
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,709
Oh, just nothing. Makin' conversation.

354
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,311
Okay.

355
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:03,445
You sleeping with her?

356
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:04,813
Lord, no.

357
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:07,062
She's my ex-wife. Come on.

358
00:14:07,064 --> 00:14:11,153
Oh, my gosh, what kind of
sicko sleeps with their ex-wife?

359
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:12,654
Where is this coming from?

360
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,289
Are you jealous?

361
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,824
No.

362
00:14:15,826 --> 00:14:18,010
I'd just like to know, you know,

363
00:14:18,012 --> 00:14:19,528
what kind of relationship we're in.

364
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,564
I mean, are we seeing
other people or what?

365
00:14:22,566 --> 00:14:24,366
Connie Tucker,

366
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:27,135
are you asking me to go steady?

367
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,705
You know what I'm asking, jackass.

368
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,234
All right, all right, all right.

369
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,555
You listen to me. Now, I'm 72 years old.

370
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:35,094
Do you think I have enough stamina

371
00:14:35,096 --> 00:14:37,279
to go playing around with other women?

372
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,074
You saying the only
reason you're seeing me

373
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,049
is you're too old and tired to see anybody else?

374
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:43,386
Give me the Tums.

375
00:14:51,729 --> 00:14:54,696
I could kiss you forever.

376
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,598
Uh, that's kind of a long time.

377
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
You got somewhere else to be?

378
00:14:58,102 --> 00:14:59,901
No. It's just that,

379
00:14:59,903 --> 00:15:01,670
eventually, we're gonna get hungry.

380
00:15:01,672 --> 00:15:05,040
Why do I keep getting the
feeling you're not into this?

381
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,676
Oh, I am into this.

382
00:15:07,678 --> 00:15:09,578
But?

383
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:14,883
I mean, we're real young, and
who knows what's gonna happen?

384
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:16,952
I know. And you should, too.

385
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,865
Don't feel bad.

386
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:20,589
I don't know lots of stuff.

387
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:23,014
So, as long as we're on the subject,

388
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:24,526
are you seeing anybody else?

389
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,728
No.

390
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:29,053
How about that nutty professor?

391
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,165
We're just friends.

392
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,634
Yeah, well, that's
what June and I are...

393
00:15:32,636 --> 00:15:34,470
just friends.

394
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,042
So what are we?

395
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,363
I don't know.

396
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:42,865
What do you want to call it?

397
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:47,049
I guess, a...

398
00:15:47,051 --> 00:15:50,052
committed relationship.

399
00:15:50,054 --> 00:15:52,621
Mm. Works for me.

400
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:54,723
- Okay.
- Hmm.

401
00:15:54,725 --> 00:15:56,926
It's settled.

402
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:03,532
Connie.

403
00:16:03,534 --> 00:16:06,469
This relationship is suffocating me.

404
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:11,485
What'd I say?

405
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:12,974
I'm not enough for you.

406
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:14,676
I didn't say that.

407
00:16:14,678 --> 00:16:16,678
Just be honest.

408
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,547
You want to date other girls.

409
00:16:18,549 --> 00:16:20,575
I don't want to date
other girls instead of you,

410
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:23,785
just... in addition to you.

411
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:26,322
Drop dead.

412
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:38,133
Okay, but I'm gonna follow you
and make sure you get home safe!

413
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:40,102
Do whatever you want.

414
00:16:40,104 --> 00:16:42,972
If you walk to Dairy Queen,
I'll buy you a Blizzard.

415
00:16:44,074 --> 00:16:46,541
Want me to turn on some music?

416
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:56,551
Well, this is just delicious, Mary.

417
00:16:56,553 --> 00:16:57,687
Thank you.

418
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:00,122
Bite-sized enough for you?

419
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,125
Oh. Perfect.

420
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,209
How long do I have to sit here

421
00:17:06,211 --> 00:17:08,263
and sulk before someone
asks me what's wrong?

422
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:10,599
Maybe people are tired
of hearing about it.

423
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:12,801
Ms. Hutchins, would
you care to chime in?

424
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:15,203
Oh, I-I don't want to get in the middle

425
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:17,038
of a family issue, but...

426
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,390
I will say that I once had a falling out

427
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,009
with someone very close to me.

428
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:22,210
What happened?

429
00:17:22,212 --> 00:17:25,281
We ended up parting ways on bad terms.

430
00:17:26,116 --> 00:17:28,083
I-I still regret it.

431
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:30,018
But you were right and they were wrong?

432
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,153
You know what,

433
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,988
it doesn't feel like it matters anymore.

434
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,092
And not a day goes by
that I don't miss them.

435
00:17:38,328 --> 00:17:41,930
Perhaps I do owe Dr. Sturgis an apology.

436
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:44,199
I was talking about your mother.

437
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:46,436
I'll circle back to her.

438
00:17:49,249 --> 00:17:50,538
Thank you.

439
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,463
I can't believe you got through to him.

440
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:53,508
Happy to help.

441
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,044
So, who was the person
you had the fight with?

442
00:17:56,046 --> 00:17:57,654
It was my cat, Poe.

443
00:17:57,656 --> 00:18:00,792
She ran away when I
switched to dry food.

444
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:04,287
It was cheaper.

445
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:10,426
- Good night, baby.
- Night, Mama.

446
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,029
I'm really sorry, Mom.

447
00:18:14,031 --> 00:18:16,398
I forgive you.

448
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,950
But just because you
straightened things out

449
00:18:18,952 --> 00:18:21,570
with Dr. Sturgis doesn't mean
you're going back to college.

450
00:18:21,572 --> 00:18:23,148
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

451
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,208
I hope you know you're
jeopardizing our relationship.

452
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,443
I will take that risk.

453
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:30,246
Good night.

454
00:18:31,215 --> 00:18:33,515
You know I'll eventually wear you down.

455
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:35,510
We'll see.

456
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,353
I'm pretty tough.

457
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,389
I eventually wore her down.

458
00:18:41,391 --> 00:18:44,193
There's just so much
of me anybody can take.

459
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:48,674
In local news, Friday
night's football game

460
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:51,410
was marred by a brutal injury,

461
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:54,291
when football coach
George Cooper saved himself

462
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:58,628
at the expense of beloved
school librarian Cheryl Hutchins.

463
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,686
Oh, no.

464
00:18:59,688 --> 00:19:03,579
We warn you, the following
footage is hard to watch.

465
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:05,171
Well, then, don't show it.

466
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,208
Let's see it again in slow motion.

467
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,444
This is not news.
