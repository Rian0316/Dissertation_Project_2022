17
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:02,950
我的哥哥们和我都是历史上
My brothers and I are the first vampires,

18
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,710
最早的吸血鬼  是始祖家族
in all of history-- the originals.

19
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,030
三百年前  我们帮助建立了新奥尔良
300 years ago, we helped build New Orleans.

20
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,570
现在我们回到了这个战争中的城市
Now we've returned to find a city at war.

21
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,590
吸血鬼马塞尔领导着一支部队
The vampire Marcel leads an army

22
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,160
对抗一群绝望的女巫
against a coven of desperate witches.

23
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,540
我的哥哥克劳斯与他们两者为敌
My brother Klaus is playing against both sides,

24
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,000
他渴望权力
hungry for power

25
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,100
希望保护怀着他孩子的狼人
and hoping to protect the werewolf carrying his child,

26
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,090
但是马塞尔有一个优势
but Marcel has an advantage.

27
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,480
他在一个秘密武器的帮助下
He holds our brother Elijah captive

28
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,510
俘获了我们的哥哥以利亚
with the aid of a secret weapon.

29
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,330
现在为了救回我深爱的哥哥
Now in order to get back the brother I love,

30
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,310
我别无选择  
I have no choice 

31
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,810
只能支持我无法信任的那个哥哥
but to side with the one I cannot trust.

32
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,890
1359年8月
August 1359.

33
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,460
我注意到兄弟姐妹之间的一个不同
I have noticed a difference in my siblings.

34
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,380
我们之间的联系
Our bond strains 

35
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,120
在吸血鬼生活的压力之下更为紧张
beneath the pressure of our life as vampires.

36
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,310
一旦被吸血鬼的魔性缠身  
Each day removes them further from the humanity 

37
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,760
就会离人性日渐日远
they once possessed.

38
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,600
我亲爱的妹妹丽贝卡
My sweet sister Rebekah

39
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,090
变得越来越冷漠无情
has grown quite indifferent to brutality.

40
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,290
然而  问题最大的还是尼克劳斯
However, the true problem remains, my brother Niklaus.

41
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,740
他依然用残忍掩饰着自己的孤独
He continues to hide his loneliness with cruelty.

42
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,790
不过  我依然坚持相信  我作为他们的大哥
Still, I cling to the hope that I, as their eldest brother,

43
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,840
可以将他们领回正轨
can lead them down the correct path,

44
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,600
受到家族力量指引的正轨
a path charged with the power of a family united...

45
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,700
如果我失败了
For if I fail,

46
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,430
我们的家族只能在黑暗中沦陷
our family's legacy will end in darkness.

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,390
我不敢相信
I cannot believe 

48
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,360
你居然不等我  自己处理了那些吸血鬼
you disposed of those vampires without me.

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,510
我知道我最喜欢火烧一切了
You know how I love to set things on fire.

50
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,180
难道我该把他们留在前院任由他们腐烂吗
Was I supposed to leave them in the front yard to rot?

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,820
再说了  他们是我该负的责任
Besides, they were my responsibility.

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,440
他们攻击了怀着我孩子的
They attacked the helpless, pregnant girl

53
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,950
无助的小孕妇
who's carrying my child.

54
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,570
我好感动啊
Oh, I am so moved

55
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,240
你对怀着你的混血儿孩子的狼人的
by your newfound sense of fatherly duty

56
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,400
新生父亲的职责
towards the werewolf carrying

57
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,330
好让我感动
your hybrid bun in her oven.

58
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,230
狼女想知道计划是什么
The werewolf would like to know what the plan is.

59
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,490
那要看你说的是什么计划
Well, that depends what plan you mean, luv--

60
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,490
是我统治全球的计划
My plan for global domination

61
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,790
还是丽贝卡在残酷世界中寻找真爱的计划
or Rebekah's plan to find love in a cruel, cruel world.

62
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,320
营救以利亚的计划
The plan to rescue Elijah,

63
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,930
你知道  那个好哥哥
you know-- the good brother,

64
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,440
被你从背后插入匕首
the one who is now in the possession

65
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
现在被你的死敌
of your mortal enemy after you stabbed him

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,330
所控制的那个
in the back.

67
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,470
明确点说  是从前面
In the front, if we're being specific.

68
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,970
你们俩说过你们会救回他的
You two said that you would get him back.

69
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,760
那么现在有计划吗
So is there a plan, or what?

70
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,720
好吧
Ok.

71
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,020
首先  马塞尔不是我的死敌
Well, firstly, Marcel is not my mortal enemy.

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,210
他是我的朋友   
He's my friend, 

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,360
虽然他没有意识到
albeit one who is unaware 

74
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
我正试图破坏
that I am trying to sabotage 

75
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,220
他对整个超自然法属区的控制 
his hold over the supernatural community of the french quarter, 

76
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,050
但是尽管如此  还是朋友
but a friend nonetheless,

77
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,720
第二点  我用匕首封住以利亚
and secondly, I daggered Elijah

78
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,040
是为了赢得马塞尔的信任
in order to gain Marcel's trust.

79
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,090
要是我早知道
If I had known 

80
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,050
他会让我的哥哥被一个
he would place my brother in the hands of 

81
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,670
特别暴躁的十几岁的巫师控制
a particularly nasty teenage witch,

82
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,390
我绝对会考虑做出略微不同的选择  
I certainly would have weighed my options a bit differently, 

83
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,080
第三点  妹妹  请说
and thirdly, sister, please.

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,360
第三点  正如你所要求的
And thirdly, the plan, as you have demanded,

85
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,260
计划就是尼克劳斯直接向马塞尔要回以利亚
is for Niklaus to simply asks Marcel for Elijah back.

86
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,820
这并不是全部的计划  是吗
That's not the whole plan, is it?

87
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,000
拜托
Oh, please.

88
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,140
克劳斯也许作为一个兄弟并不称职  
Klaus may be a miserable excuse for a sibling, 

89
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,390
但是没有别的坏心了
but there is none more diabolical.

90
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,530
这就是唯一的计划  亲爱的
That's only the plan "A," luv.

91
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,260
但总有备用计划
There's always a plan "B."

92
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,320
备用计划是什么
And what's plan "B"?

93
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,680
开战
War.

94
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,780
讨厌  我穿西装太帅了
Damn, I do look good in a suit.

95
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,750
{\an8}即时新闻
游客失踪

96
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,780
约书亚·罗森  18岁
Joshua Rosen, 18,

97
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,510
近日来到新奥尔良  作为...
had recently arrived in New Orleans as part of...

98
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,850
我在码头的手下会主动站出来
My guy at the docks is gonna come forward 

99
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,370
做目击证人
as an eyewitness,

100
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,310
证明他看到
say he saw 

101
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,560
这两个喝醉了的人摔进了密西西比河
those two drunkenly fall into the Mississippi.

102
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,550
他们会被调查好几周
They'll be dredging for weeks.

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,350
没人会到这附近察看
No one will come looking around here.

104
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,040
那很好  
That's good, 

105
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
考虑到一个死在了县停尸房后面的垃圾桶里
considering one is dead in a dumpster behind the county morgue

106
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,340
而另一个现在已经是吸血鬼了
and the other one is a vampire now.

107
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,490
还有什么吗
Anything else?

108
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,500
请让我来  亲爱的
Allow me, darling.

109
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,900
还有一件事
One thing.

110
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,390
我派出了4个夜行吸血鬼
I sent 4 nightwalkers 

111
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,150
去调查法属区出现的一个狼人
to look into a werewolf sighting in the quarter.

112
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,590
之后就再也没有他们的消息了
I haven't heard from them since.

113
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,630
那上周一共死了10个夜行吸血鬼了
That makes 10 dead nightwalkers in the last week.

114
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,750
你觉得是狼人重新回到这里
You think the werewolves are back in town

115
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,350
想要制造麻烦吗
trying to start some trouble?

116
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,650
我知道你和克劳斯是朋友
Look. I know you and Klaus are friends,

117
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,630
但事实是  自从始祖们出现
but the fact is, since the originals showed up--

118
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,320
快住嘴吧  蒂埃里
Oh, come now, Thierry.

119
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,910
你不会还在为我之前给你的
You're not still upset about that 

120
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,750
一小口有毒的狼人伤口而生气吧
little, toxic werewolf bite I gave you, are you?

121
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,250
我以为那已经是过去的恩怨了
I thought we were at bygones.

122
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,000
我看你现在也给了他在这片区域自由行动的特权
I see you've given him free rein of your compound now, too.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,280
没错  就当做是我的家人和我
Yes. Well, seeing as my family and I

124
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,310
曾住在这里  建立了这地方  实际上
lived here, built the place, in fact--

125
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,450
行了  别这样
All right. Come on.

126
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,810
你们俩都知道规矩
You both know the drill.

127
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,490
蒂埃里是我的人  亲信
Thierry is my guy, inner circle.

128
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,990
克劳斯是我的旧友和忠主
Klaus is my old-time friend and sire.

129
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,830
还是这里的客人
He's also a guest here.

130
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,200
和平共处  行吗  行吗
Peace, all right? All right?

131
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,320
你有何需要  兄弟
What you need, my brother?

132
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,770
我想我妹妹丽贝卡坚持让我要回以利亚
I'm afraid my sister Rebekah is insisting I demand Elijah's return.

133
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,940
她对此非常生气
She's quite worked up about it.

134
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,790
当然
I'll say.

135
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,320
马上就要有3个始祖在镇上活动了  是吗
We're not gonna have 3 originals walking around town, are we?

136
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,960
我们有一半人
Half our guys 

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,550
都觉得是他妹妹杀死了夜行吸血鬼
think the sister killed the nightwalkers.

138
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,480
那是对一个始祖的指控吗
Is that an accusation against an original?

139
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,370
我刚刚不是说了要和平共处吗
What did I say about peace?

140
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,060
来
Come on.

141
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,870
跟我走走
Walk with me.

142
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,250
你的亲信缺乏幽默感
Your inner circle man lacks a sense of humor.

143
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,800
他有点过分保护我  但是十分忠诚
He's a little overprotective, but loyal to a fault.

144
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,720
在四十年代  我救了他
I saved his life back in the forties,

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,670
在退伍军人医院外发现他因战伤快要死掉
found him dying of a war wound outside a VA hospital.

146
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,970
他会为我杀人  为我而死
He'd kill for me and die for me.

147
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,220
还有  那个男孩吹小号真的好到不行
Plus, that boy can play the trumpet like you would not believe.

148
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,290
也许看看今晚能不能让他在派对上表演一下
Maybe I'll see if he can play a little tonight at the party.

149
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,410
你会来的  对吧
You're coming, right?

150
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,680
我怎么能错过认识议员的机会呢
How can I miss my chance to meet the city councilman

151
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,540
他可是接受了你们巨额的慈善捐款呢
as he accepts your gigantic charitable donation?

152
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,960
他是个笨蛋
Oh, he's a schmuck, 

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,920
但是为了某些社区服务  
but he lets us do our thing 

154
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,710
他允许我们做自己的事情
in exchange for certain community services,

155
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,150
比如不把我们的尖牙对准当地人
like keeping our fangs out of the locals.

156
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,130
听着
Listen. 

157
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,470
关于你哥哥
About your brother,

158
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,340
我很想帮你排忧解难  但是蒂埃里说得对
I would love to help you out, but Thierry is right.

159
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,620
我的人都紧张不安
My guys are on edge.

160
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,710
他们看到始祖家族回到这里
They see the original family moving in,

161
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,710
有吸血鬼死掉  这让他们非常紧张
vampires dying, it makes them nervous.

162
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,020
如果我现在把以利亚还给你
If I hand Elijah back now,

163
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,590
也许会产生错误印象  
it might give the wrong impression 

164
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,740
让他们不知道谁是这里真正的老大
about who's really in charge here.

165
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,950
你懂我意思嘛
You know what I mean?

166
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,420
你得理解我不得不开口
You understand I had to ask.

167
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,470
克劳斯  帮抹大拉的玛利亚[娼妓]问一句
Hey, Klaus, for the love of Mary Magdalene,

168
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,510
一个简单的问题要问多久
how long does it take to ask a simple question?

169
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,750
比你们想的要久多了
Much longer than you'd think,

170
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,250
因为回答正如预期中一样  是不行
considering the answer was, as expected, no.

171
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,300
马塞尔的手下  蒂埃里很多疑
Marcel's man Thierry is suspicious.

172
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,430
他绝对是你杀死了10个夜行吸血鬼
He thinks you killed 10 nightwalkers.

173
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,200
说谎  我只杀了8个
Well, that's a lie. I only killed 8.

174
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,330
我应该让蒂埃里成为第九个吗
Should I make Thierry the ninth?

175
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,100
马塞尔在假装友善
Marcel is playing friendly.

176
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,730
我们不能杀死他最爱的儿子  
We can't kill the favorite son, 

177
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,780
否则他会对付我们的
or he'll catch onto us.

178
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,050
-那就开战吧  -的确是
- So war it is, then. - Indeed.

179
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,900
你知道怎么对付那个女巫吗
Do you know what to do with the witch?

180
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,670
-我觉得知道  -很好
- I believe I do. - Good.

181
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,850
你对付索菲·德弗罗
You manage Sophie Deveraux.

182
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,970
我来负责下一步
I'll take care of the next step.

183
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,140
我命令你放干他的血
I ordered you to drain him of blood.

184
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,830
怎么这么久
What's taking so long?

185
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,160
抱歉  我不是什么中世纪拷问专家
Sorry. I'm not medieval torture expert guy.

186
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,250
他到底对你做了什么
What did he do to you, anyway?

187
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,720
和他做了什么无关
It's not about what he did.

188
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,780
而是我们完事之后他会做什么
It's about what he's going to do when we're done here,

189
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,250
也就是我想要让他做什么都行  和你一样
which is whatever I want him to, just like you.

190
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,010
比如  用这个刺穿他的身体
For example, drive this through his torso.

191
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,130
真是太疯狂了
That is crazy.

192
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,230
我不想这么做  但却做了
I didn't want to do it, but I did it, anyway.

193
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,900
这叫精神控制
It's called mind compulsion.

194
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,530
吸血鬼可以控制人类
Vampires can compel humans.

195
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,570
像我和我兄弟姐妹这样的始祖可以控制吸血鬼
Originals like my siblings and I can also compel vampires,

196
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,440
而没人能控制始祖
and no one can compel originals.

197
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,900
你懂了吗  很好
You following? Good.

198
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,300
那就是像你这样的全新的夜行吸血鬼
That is how a brand-new nightwalker such as yourself 

199
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,240
为何在这里在谁都没察觉的情况下听从我的命令
is here doing my bidding with no one the wiser.

200
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,670
但是我的血液从来没流干过
But I never had my guts drained out of me.

201
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,730
是的  那个嘛  年轻的约书亚
Yes. That, young Joshua,

202
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,410
是因为在你体内没有一点马鞭草时
is because I got to you before you had even 

203
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,840
我就已经控制你了
a drop of herbal vervain in your system.

204
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,850
马鞭草能阻止控制
You see, it prevents compulsion.

205
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,870
马塞尔让他所有的同伴
Marcel has had his whole crew 

206
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,870
在我回来后开始饮用马鞭草
taking it since I returned to town,

207
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,820
那也就是为什么我们这位朋友需要放干血液
and that is why our friend here needs to be bled dry of it

208
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,790
那样我就能控制他听从我的命令了
so I can compel him to follow my every command,

209
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,630
现在我的哥哥被俘等待我的营救
and with my brother currently in captivity awaiting rescue, 

210
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,800
我们就不能那么温柔了
we can't afford to be gentle about it.

211
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,240
不是吗
Can we?

212
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,350
真高兴你能来
Oh, so glad you could make it.

213
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,580
在你磨磨蹭蹭的时候 
Elijah only lies daggered and rotting 

214
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,190
以利亚身插匕首躺着腐烂呢
whilst you dillydally.

215
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,630
我能来你就该庆幸了
You're lucky I came at all.

216
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,480
你想要干嘛
What do you want?

217
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,380
昨晚海莉被马塞尔的人攻击了
Hayley was attacked last night by Marcel's crew

218
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,960
因为有人告诉他在法属区看到一只狼人
because somebody told him there was a werewolf in the quarter.

219
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,580
她只去过一个地方
She only made one stop.

220
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,450
不管是谁看到的她  出卖了她
Whoever saw her here ratted her out.

221
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,680
看好  学着点
Watch and learn.

222
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,410
-你好  索菲  -你好  凯蒂
- Hey, Soph. - Hey, Katie.

223
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,850
那里面都是金盏花
That's filled with marigold,

224
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,880
很能吸引异性
great for attracting the opposite sex,

225
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,190
很配你
Would look awesome on you.

226
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,520
深表怀疑
I very seriously doubt that.

227
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,180
你还有其他的吗  有...
Do you have any others, one with, say--

228
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,060
我不知道  也许是附子草
I don't know-- wolfsbane, perhaps?

229
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,660
附子草  你为什么想要那个
Wolfsbane? Why would you want that?

230
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,720
别跟我装傻
Please do not play dumb with me.

231
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,730
丽贝卡
Rebekah!

232
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,990
我只卖了一些药草给那个狼人  仅此而已
I just sold the werewolf some herbs. That's all.

233
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,590
你在骗我吗  凯蒂
Are you lying to me, Katie?

234
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,140
我建议你诚实回答我的问题
I suggest you answer my question honestly.

235
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,210
回答她的问题  凯蒂  拜托
Just answer the question, Katie, please.

236
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,470
是  我告诉别人了  但是你不理解
Yes. I told someone, but you don't understand.

237
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,650
我爱他
I--I love him.

238
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,560
告诉我  你的吸血鬼情人是谁
Then tell me, who is this vampire Romeo of yours?

239
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,430
要我倒数吗
Shall I count to 3?

240
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,830
快点
Be quick about it.

241
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,800
我还要建立一整个部队呢
I have an army to build, 

242
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,820
一个被控制的仆从可不是一支部队
and one compelled minion does not an army make.

243
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,000
怎么样
Well?

244
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,460
你说对了谁是叛徒
You were right about the traitor.

245
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,660
幸运的是  她只是个孩子
Luckily, she's just a kid 

246
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,030
对我们一无所知  也不知道我们的目的
and she doesn't know anything about us and what we're up to.

247
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:08,600
你想听听
Do you want to hear the part

248
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,960
最能让你高兴的事吗
that's gonna please you the most?

249
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,050
请说吧
Oh, do tell.

250
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,780
她爱着马塞尔的一个亲信
She's in love with someone in Marcel's inner circle.

251
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,580
猜猜是谁
Guess who it is.

252
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:19,920
左膀右臂  得力助手
Right-hand-man type, favors silly caps?

253
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,300
回答正确加两分
Two points for you.

254
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,030
蒂埃里和敌人越来越亲近了
Thierry is fraternizing with the enemy.

255
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,590
那就意味着他不知不觉
Well, that means he just unwittingly 

256
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,560
变成了我们整个计划的关键
became the key to our entire plan.

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,970
我说了这能让你很高兴
I told you you'd be pleased.

258
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,020
在一个吸血鬼和女巫对峙的城市里
Oh, to be young and in love in a city

259
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,960
血气方刚  深陷热恋
where witches and vampires are at war.

260
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,810
真是太不幸了
How very tragic.

261
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,960
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

262
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,630
-不行  -这很简单
- No way. - It's very simple.

263
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,330
我们只要你施一个小小的
We need you to perform a teeny,

264
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,920
非常小的定位咒帮我们找到我们的哥哥
tiny locator spell to help us find our brother.

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,240
在镇上任何使用魔法的女巫都会被抓
Witches who practice magic in this town get caught, 

266
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,210
然后会被杀
and they get killed.

267
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,080
对  这事嘛
Yes. About that, 

268
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,520
在我们交易时  似乎你遗漏了一个重要细节
it seems you left out a crucial detail when we made our deal--

269
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,450
马塞尔的秘密武器
Marcel's secret weapon, 

270
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,380
他知道女巫使用魔法的办法
the way he knows when a witch is using magic.

271
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,110
这么高的小女孩  很可爱  很容易生气
Girl about yay high, cute as a button, anger issues.

272
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,690
达维娜
Davina?

273
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,820
你在哪看到她的
Where have you seen her?

274
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,890
不知道
I don't know.

275
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,090
那个小屁孩抹去了我的记忆
The little brat erased my memory

276
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,110
就在她用她该死的意念把我扔出窗外之后
right after she threw me out a window with her bloody mind.

277
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,870
我来说重点吧
Let me cut to the chase.

278
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,910
以利亚在达维娜手上
Davina has Elijah.

279
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,500
你们女巫  我想  
You witches, I assume, 

280
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,550
会很想把达维娜和马塞尔分开
want to get Davina away from Marcel.

281
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,340
我们不知道她在哪
We don't know where she is.

282
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,290
因此  我们需要魔法
Ergo, we need magic.

283
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,180
达维娜会感觉到的
Davina would sense it.

284
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,660
当然除非  另一个女巫
Unless, of course, another witch--

285
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,560
比如  因为一个叛徒
Say, a traitor to the cause,

286
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,330
比如凯蒂
Katie, for example-- 

287
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,890
同时在施一个更加强大的魔法
was to perform much more powerful magic at the same time.

288
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,420
那样就会产生一个烟雾
That would create a smokescreen

289
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,090
能够掩盖你的小小咒语不被达维娜发现
concealing your very small spell from Davina.

290
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,170
凯蒂不该死
Katie doesn't deserve to die.

291
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,800
索菲·德弗罗
Sophie Deveraux...

292
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,700
你不可能这么有原则
You're in no position to be so principled.

293
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,760
没有战略上的损失是不能赢得战争的
You can't win a war without a few strategic losses,

294
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,060
不管那损失会有多让人可惜
no matter how regrettable they may be.

295
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,660
有多少次吸血鬼总是领先一步
How many times have the vampires been one step ahead,

296
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,140
知道一些他们不该知道的事情
known something they shouldn't,

297
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,270
你的姐姐在公共广场被处决
your sister executed in the public square

298
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,590
就因为使用魔法  谁先知道她会被抓住
for practicing magic who knew she'd be caught?

299
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,860
她有没有试图逃走
Did she even attempt to flee?

300
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,930
她藏在一艘货船的货舱里  
She was caught hiding in a cargo hold of a freighter 

301
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,180
就在船准备在密西西比河里起航时被抓了
before it set sail down the Mississippi.

302
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,760
那么是谁  请你告诉我
And who, pray tell,

303
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
在马塞尔的最重要亲信中
in Marcel's valued inner circle

304
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,640
管理他的码头生意
manages his business at the docks?

305
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,980
凯蒂的男朋友  蒂埃里
Katie's boyfriend Thierry.

306
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,840
你说得对  他很不错
You're right. He's good.

307
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,520
对吧  我叫他音乐人
Right? Music man I call him.

308
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,300
女士们都爱他  但是他心有所属了
Ladies love him, but he's spoken for.

309
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,900
他总是围绕着他美丽的小女巫
He knocks around with this pretty, little witch,

310
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,080
说他爱她  但是我不知道
says he loves her, but I don't know.

311
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,750
你最重要的战士和你的敌人
Your brightest soldier is fraternizing

312
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,200
情谊深厚  你却不在意
with your enemy, and you don't care.

313
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,570
我当然在意  但是蒂埃里是个成熟男人了
Well, of course I care, but Thierry is a grown man.

314
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,070
他会自己做决定
He makes his own choices,

315
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,770
我也能得到一些重要内情
and I get some good intel.

316
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,290
再说了  他也不会做什么
Besides, he's not gonna do anything

317
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,250
危害我们事业的事情
to jeopardize what we're doing here.

318
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,590
你瞧瞧
I mean, check this out,

319
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,700
一个吸血鬼主持着一个奢华的慈善晚会
a vampire hosting a ritzy charity event.

320
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,370
我们在这里是一个整体  没人会破坏
We have a community here. No one is gonna mess that up.

321
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,750
不过呢
Still...

322
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,000
你还是不会想让那些女巫们太大胆了
You don't want the witches to get too bold,

323
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,950
考虑到一个女巫说镇上有狼人
given that a witch's tip about a werewolf in town

324
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,450
导致了你的夜行吸血鬼的失踪
led to the disappearance of your nightwalkers.

325
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,040
我确定你考虑了
I'm sure you've considered

326
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,550
这可能是个陷阱的可能性
the possibility that it could've been a trap.

327
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,190
也许我该给点暗示了
Maybe I'll send a little message.

328
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,200
蒂埃里
Thierry...

329
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:11,180
今晚带一队夜行吸血鬼去女巫那
Take a team of nightwalkers to the cauldron tonight,

330
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,520
小小的骚扰一下
do a little rousting...

331
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,580
蒂埃里  不用太客气了
Oh, and, Thierry, make it nasty.

332
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,670
于是然后
And so with that, 

333
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,980
我搬回这里为了更亲近我的哥哥们  因为
I moved back here to be closer to my brothers because--

334
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,180
实话实说吧  家人最重要了  对吧  卡米尔
let's face it-- family is important, right, Camille?

335
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,570
叫我卡米  我得改掉这个胸牌
Cami. I have to change this name tag.

336
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,590
喝醉了的人都喜欢用法语跟我搭讪
Drunk guys keep hitting on me in French.

337
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,020
你真的以前没来过这里吗
You sure you haven't been in here before?

338
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,890
你看起来很面熟
Your face looks so familiar.

339
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,810
你一定是见过我在外面走过吧
You must have seen me out and about.

340
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,960
你不是在和马塞尔·杰拉德约会吗
Aren't you dating Marcel Gerard?

341
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,550
他是我的朋友  算是吧
He's a pal of mine... sort of.

342
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,130
我听说他在卢梭时期就喜欢金发的酒保了
I heard he had a crush on the blond bartender at Rousseau's.

343
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,430
我不会管那叫约会
I would hardly call it dating.

344
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:54,250
他在追求我  算是吧
He's wooing me... sort of.

345
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,100
我不知道
I don't know.

346
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,790
他很有魅力
He's very charming,

347
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,920
这大概意味着我该赶快逃走
which probably means I should run for the hills.

348
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,600
我自己现在有点处在分分合合的状态中
I'm kind of in an on-again/off-again thing myself at the moment.

349
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
这样最糟了  不是吗
Those are the worst, aren't they,

350
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,140
有些你放不下
the ones you can't shake,

351
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,370
虽然你不会上当
even though you know better,

352
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,180
你总是很明白
and you always know better?

353
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,930
我喜欢你  卡米
I like you, Cami.

354
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,250
大部分女孩都很烦地爱发牢骚
Most girls have the unfortunate tendency of being whiny,

355
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,560
嘲讽别人
little twits.

356
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,430
谢了  
Thanks...I think.

357
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,580
我该去参加今晚这个慈善家举办的
Hey, I'm supposed to go to this posh charity thing

358
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,660
奢华的慈善晚会
thrown by this philanthropist tonight.

359
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,540
他有点像盖茨比  筹办了一个低劣的派对
He's a bit of a Gatsby, throws a mean party.

360
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,350
有兴趣吗
Any interest?

361
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,140
小妹
Little sister.

362
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,400
哥哥  我相信我确保了
Well, brother, I believe I've made certain

363
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,670
马塞尔今晚会有点分心
Marcel will be properly distracted tonight.

364
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,910
我该问吗
Dare I ask?

365
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,210
只能说他的注意力不会在我们身上
Let's just say his attention will not be on us.

366
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,230
我尽到了自己的绵薄之力
I did my bit.

367
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,590
你在忙什么来确保以利亚的平安回来
What are you doing to ensure Elijah's safe return?

368
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,050
现在呢  我在准备以防心肠软的做个保险
Currently, I'm preparing insurance against the tender-hearted.

369
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:54,820
什么意思
Meaning?

370
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,000
我们需要给凯蒂做个合适的动机
We need proper motivation for Katie

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,410
在今晚施个强大的咒语
to cast a powerful spell tonight.

372
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,200
我在制作动机呢
I'm creating that motivation.

373
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,570
马塞尔下令骚扰女巫
Marcel has ordered a rousting of the witches.

374
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,950
不
No!

375
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,190
我就反过来  安排事情悲剧地出错
I, in turn, have arranged for things to go tragically wrong.

376
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,140
明白要做什么吗
You understand what you're to do?

377
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,130
没问题
Good.

378
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,320
外面怎么了
What's happening out there?

379
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,880
是克劳斯
Oh, it's Klaus.

380
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,620
他让马塞尔觉得女巫
He's convinced Marcel that the witches

381
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,840
在计划采取行动对付他
are planning to make a move against him.

382
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,010
马塞尔想让我们来给个暗示
Marcel wants us to send a message,

383
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,650
如果他觉得我偏宠了
and if he thought I was playing favorites

384
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,310
就因为我爱上了一个女巫
just because I'm in love with a witch--

385
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,570
再说一次
Say that again.

386
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,090
我爱你  凯蒂
I love you, Katie,

387
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,240
一切都会好起来的  我保证
And all this is gonna be ok, promise.

388
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,540
马塞尔也许不在意
Marcel may not be concerned

389
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,320
蒂埃里那些你侬我侬
with Thierry's romantic entanglements.

390
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,570
那边我已经去过了
I already got that one.

391
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,170
但还有些罪过对他而言
But there are other crimes which he'll be

392
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,580
就不那么容易原谅了
less inclined to so easily forgive...

393
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,850
蒂埃里
Aah! Thierry! Aah!

394
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,660
放开她  滚开
Leave her alone. Get off.

395
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,930
杀死自己的同僚  就算一个
Killing a vampire, for example.

396
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,800
那将是不可原谅的
That would be unforgivable.

397
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,110
如果凯蒂想让她的爱人
If Katie hopes to save her one true love

398
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,580
免于马塞尔的惩罚
from Marcel's punishment, 

399
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,270
而想要救他
well, a rescue mission

400
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,720
必须使用魔法
like that will require something positively magical,

401
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,640
不过话说回来
But then...

402
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,810
除了爱情还有什么值得付出生命呢
What's worth dying for if not love?

403
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,810
{\an8}化妆舞会

404
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,810
{\an8}造福全城

405
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,640
不得不赞一句  这个背景音乐
Well, it's certainly a fitting backdrop

406
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,550
很适合今晚
for tonight's events, I must say.

407
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,720
她在这里做什么
What's she doing here?

408
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,410
还有什么比让马塞尔的的人类小女友
What better way to distract Marcel

409
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,420
置身于吸血鬼扎堆的地方
than to put his very human, 

410
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,860
更能分散他精力
new girl in a room chock full of vampires?

411
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,580
你好  亲爱的  你好美
Hello, darling. You look precious.

412
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,070
这个舞会真荒诞
This party is ridiculous,

413
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:24,580
但我觉得我会慢慢喜欢上它
but I think I could get to enjoy this place.

414
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,550
他就是那个臭名昭著的令人捉摸不定的家伙
Is he the infamous on-again/off-again?

415
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,860
实际上  你说的那个是哥哥
He's the brother, actually,

416
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,280
而我妹妹说得没错
and my sister is right.

417
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:38,080
你的确很美
You do look stunning.

418
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,770
你这身行头也很不错
You clean up pretty well yourself.

419
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,500
别被唬弄了  亲爱的
Well, don't be fooled, love.

420
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,250
我可是只披着羊皮的狼
I'm the devil in disguise.

421
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,900
你俩聊  我要来点酒
You two chitchat. I need booze.

422
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,530
-跳舞吗  -好的
- Shall we? - Ok.

423
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,450
苏格兰威士忌  谢谢
Scotch, please.

424
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,160
你邀请她来是想让自己招人喜欢吗
You're trying to be cute inviting her here?

425
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,560
我觉得她很珍贵
I think she's darling.

426
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
我敢说你爱的就是她那颗纯洁的心
I can tell you fancy her pure heart.

427
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,390
或许哪天我会亲手喂给你
Perhaps I'll feed it to you.

428
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,600
你吃醋的样子真好看  丽贝卡
Hmm, jealousy looks good on you, Rebekah.

429
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:26,310
丽贝卡说的那个人
The guy of hers Rebekah was talking about,

430
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,850
我觉得应该就是马塞尔
I'm sensing that would be Marcel.

431
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,910
要是我才不想那么多呢
I wouldn't worry about it.

432
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,800
多事老黄历了
Ancient history.

433
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,280
我在想的是你妹妹是个贱人
I'm beginning to think your sister is a bit of a bitch.

434
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,580
这个词儿好像还是她首创的
It's as though she invented the term.

435
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,200
听着
Listen.

436
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,080
允许我离开一下
Pardon me for a moment.

437
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,440
卡米
Cami.

438
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,490
杀手舞会
Hey, killer party.

439
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:00,570
这是应付公事的
Oh, it's more of a work thing.

440
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,490
我本打算邀请你...
I would've invited you...

441
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,430
没事  不过是约过一次会而已
Oh, no. We've been on one date.

442
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,470
不需要解释什么
No explanation necessary.

443
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,450
你做你的事  我会自娱自乐的
You do your thing. I'll entertain myself.

444
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,820
什么  弃你不顾
What, leave you alone,

445
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,020
看着你和别人一起
looking the way you do?

446
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,080
想都别想
Hell with that.

447
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,270
你不该到这里来的
You're not supposed to be out here.

448
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,280
你是谁
Who are you?

449
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,530
对不起  我没想吓着你
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

450
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,900
我是萨宾  我们见过
I'm Sabine. We met.

451
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,660
我是索菲的朋友
I'm one of Sophie's friends.

452
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,870
你是这里的女巫
You're one of the witches.

453
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,460
索菲让我在大家
Sophie just asked me to come

454
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,520
都出去玩的时候过来陪你 
keep you company while everyone is out.

455
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,240
它被你吸引了
You know, it's drawn to you.

456
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,570
你肚里的孩子
The child you're carrying

457
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,050
一半吸血鬼  一半狼人
is part vampire, part werewolf.

458
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,920
你和克劳斯创造了一个很特别的东西
You and Klaus made something special.

459
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,810
你说话口气像以利亚
You sound like Elijah.

460
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,450
他觉得这个孩子会给我们营造
He thinks this baby is gonna make us

461
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,860
一个欢乐的大家庭  但他现在却不在了
one big, happy family, but now he's gone,

462
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,430
还有...
And... 

463
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,280
我甚至都不知道它究竟...
I don't even know what...

464
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,120
是什么
it is.

465
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,560
听着  如果你想得话我可以帮你
You know, I can do something about that if you want,

466
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,570
我是说  帮你知道它是男是女
I mean, find out if it's a boy or girl.

467
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,070
我还以为你们不能在这儿使用巫术
I thought you couldn't do witchy stuff around here.

468
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,400
这不是巫术  只是一个老把戏
It's not magic, just an old trick

469
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,960
我奶奶教我的
My grandmother taught me.

470
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,200
来吧
Come on.

471
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,980
你肯定有点好奇的
You have to be a little curious.

472
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,130
我记得你说你是做社区工作的
I thought you said you were in community work.

473
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,070
社区筹款
Community fundraising.

474
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,340
办派对  让人们打开钱包捐款  
Throw a party, folks open their wallets.

475
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,740
我就是干这个的
It's kind of my thing.

476
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,220
我大概就是你们说的不好却必不可少的人[恶魔]
Guess I'm what you call a necessary evil.

477
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:18,520
那丽贝卡呢  她是你的捐款人之一吗
And Rebekah, she's one of your donors?

478
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,970
她是个老朋友
She's an old friend.

479
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,740
也不会太老
Can't be that old.

480
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,210
她看上去比我年轻
She looks younger than me.

481
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,430
你会大吃一惊的
You'd be surprised.

482
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,850
我遇见她的时候还是个孩子
I was a kid when I met her.

483
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,210
别再说她了
Enough about her.

484
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:33,380
我只是想跟你在一起
I just want to be right here with you.

485
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,450
你还真是个令人发指的小恶魔  是不是
You really are a hideously evil little thing, aren't you?

486
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:40,950
废话  他们两个是绝配
Nonsense. They're perfect for each other.

487
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,950
你想分马塞尔的心  这就成了
You wanted Marcel distracted. Voila.

488
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,500
我该走了
My cue to leave.

489
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,110
失陪
Excuse me.

490
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,550
你到底干了什么
What the hell did you do?

491
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,830
别在这儿说  换个地方说
Not here. No, not here.

492
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,670
我知道你觉得他是个禽兽
I know you think he's a monster.

493
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,690
我怎么想不重要
It doesn't matter what I think.

494
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:53,910
蒂埃里又杀了一个吸血鬼
Thierry killed another vampire.

495
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,350
他打破了马塞尔最重大的规矩
He broke Marcel's biggest rule.

496
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,750
你再也见不到他了
You'll never see him again...

497
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,850
除非我们做点什么
Unless we do something.

498
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,870
"我们"
"We"?

499
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,990
我想要救我的族人
I want to save our people.

500
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,260
你想救蒂埃里吗
You want to save Thierry?

501
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,700
要达到这两个目的只有一种方法
There's only one way we can do both.

502
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,050
准备好了吗
You ready?

503
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,090
马塞尔  要出事了
Marcel. Something is coming.

504
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,810
魔法
Magic.

505
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,390
我想听听你怎么说
I want to hear your side of it.

506
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,250
马塞尔  别这样
Hey, Marcel, come on.

507
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,170
你的版本  说
Your version. Go.

508
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,810
我们当时正在扔锅炉
We were tossing the cauldron.

509
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,590
那个人  某个夜行吸血鬼
This guy, some nightwalker,

510
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,930
无缘无故袭击了凯蒂
he attacked Katie for no reason.

511
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,390
他叫麦克斯  是我转化的
His name was Max. I turned him.

512
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,050
他并不需要什么原因
As far as reasons go, he doesn't need one.

513
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,850
她是个女巫  而他是个吸血鬼
She was a witch. He was a vampire.

514
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,470
现在他死了
Now he's dead.

515
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,270
我不是有意的
I didn't mean for it to happen.

516
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,550
你打破了我最重要的规矩
You broke my most important rule.

517
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,210
该死  我们做朋友多久了  七十年
Damn it, t. How long we been friends, 70 years?

518
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,490
是的
Yeah.

519
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,400
我把你变成了不死之身
I turned you into something that would never die.

520
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,160
我给了你一份礼物
I gave you a gift.

521
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,720
我对你也一直很忠诚
And I have been loyal to you all this time,

522
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,110
我现在依旧很忠诚
and I still am.

523
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,410
我依旧是你的朋友  马塞尔
I'm still your friend, Marcel.

524
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,350
我发誓  这没有变
I swear, that hasn't changed.

525
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,930
你说的对  亲爱的
You were right, love.

526
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,050
他脾气很大  不是吗
He's got a temper, doesn't he?

527
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,640
或许现在我该记起我早就知道会这样的
I guess this is the moment I remember I know better.

528
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,100
这是我们在他女人那里找到的
We found this at his girl's place.

529
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,940
还是我的朋友  是吗
Still my friend, huh?

530
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,250
真搞笑
That's funny because it looks to me

531
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,050
因为你的小女巫手里
like that little witch of yours got her hands on a spell

532
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,170
有我一直锁起来的咒语
that I keep locked away.

533
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,890
马塞尔  我从没见过这个
Marcel, I have never seen that.

534
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,510
闭嘴
Shut up.

535
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,900
我看你手上依旧戴着
I see on your hand, you still have

536
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,120
我给你的日光戒指
the daylight ring I gave you.

537
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,090
你还要制作戒指的秘方干什么
So what would you need with the recipe for making new ones?

538
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,580
除非你准备背叛我
Unless maybe you and Katie were gonna go off

539
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,070
和凯蒂一起另立门户
and start a little kingdom of your own?

540
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,020
不是的  马塞尔
Marcel, no.

541
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,930
让我教教你什么是朋友
Here's a lesson in friendship.

542
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,410
朋友不会欺骗我  违反我的规矩
Friends don't lie to me, they don't break my rules,

543
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,090
更不会偷走属于我的东西
and they do not steal what is mine.

544
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,680
鉴于其谋杀同伴的罪行
For the crime of murdering one of his own,

545
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,720
我宣判将蒂埃里·范舒囚禁于花园100年
I sentence Thierry Vanchure to 100 years in the garden.

546
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,790
好戏上演了
And it begins.

547
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,930
你的决定是正确的
You're doing the right thing.

548
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,160
这是唯一能找到以利亚的方式
It's the only way to find Elijah.

549
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,720
我只是做我该做的
I'm doing what I have to do.

550
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,720
不要  凯蒂
Katie, no!

551
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,450
出现得正是时候
Like clockwork.

552
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,820
快点
Hurry.

553
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,810
不
No!

554
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,110
你来拯救自己的男人吗
You're here to save your man.

555
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,970
放马过来吧  小姑娘
Well, come on, little girl.

556
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,510
去死吧  你这个贱人
Die, you son of a bitch.

557
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,990
不要  凯蒂
No! Katie!

558
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,330
事情不对劲
Something's wrong.

559
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,990
凯蒂的魔法停止了
Katie's magic stopped.

560
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,600
我可以继续
I can keep going.

561
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,870
不行  她会察觉的
You can't. She'll sense it.

562
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,370
我可以找到达维娜  再给我一点时间
No. I can find Davina. I just need another moment.

563
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,940
你或许可以为了夺回你的女巫奋不顾身
You may be willing to die to get your witch back,

564
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,920
但海莉和孩子会跟着你送死
but Hayley and the baby will die with you.

565
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,260
以利亚永远不会原谅我们
Elijah will never forgive us,

566
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,260
救回他也变会得毫无意义
and rescuing him will be for nothing.

567
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,650
都结束了  我们失败了
It's over. We failed.

568
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,730
不  凯蒂  不不不
No. Katie. No, no, no, no.

569
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,070
不
No.

570
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,540
告诉我
Just tell me this.

571
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,340
她值得吗
Was she worth it?

572
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,640
我爱他
I loved her.

573
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,950
把他封起来
Seal him up

574
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,540
让他在这腐烂
And let him rot.

575
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,930
凯米看见了多少
How much did Cami see?

576
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,390
她只见到了一场争执  伙计
She just saw an argument, mate.

577
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,650
没什么你应付不来的
It's nothing you can't fix.

578
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,640
你真的很喜欢她  是吗
You really like her, don't you?

579
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,100
我喜欢她没有被牵扯进这一切的样子
I like that she's not a part of any of this.

580
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,250
有时用人类的视角看看这个世界
Sometimes it's good to see the world

581
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,920
也是一件好事
the way the humans do.

582
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,400
蒂埃里的事我很抱歉
I am sorry about Thierry, you know?

583
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,850
看得出他是你很好的朋友
I can tell he was a good friend.

584
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,940
是我一手打造了他
I made him what he was.

585
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,570
显然  我不该信任他
Obviously, my trust was misplaced.

586
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,160
这也不会好过一点
Doesn't make it easier.

587
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,910
你今晚救了我  我欠你份人情
You saved me tonight. I guess I owe you one.

588
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,940
你想要回你的哥哥
You asked for your brother back.

589
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,700
这是我唯一能为你做的了
Seems like the least I can do.

590
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,550
-凯米  -想都别想
- Cami.  - Don't even try it.

591
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,440
我知道你为什么来
I get the bro code.

592
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,640
你是来为你朋友说好话的
You're here to smooth things over for your friend.

593
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,850
你是个好人  但是...
It's very nice of you, but--

594
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,450
但你曾被伤害过
But you've been hurt before,

595
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,830
你不敢再轻易尝试
and you aren't taking any more chances.

596
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,300
诸如此类的
Something like that.

597
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,110
今晚我见到的他
The guy I saw tonight,

598
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,700
不是我想象中的他
not the guy I thought he was.

599
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,500
如果他能轻易就这样发怒...
And if he can turn on a dime like that--

600
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,110
听上去不止是普通的心碎
Sounds like more than just a broken heart.

601
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,040
看来有人背叛了你的信任
Someone broke your trust...

602
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,350
勇敢的酒保  卡米尔
Camille, the brave bartender.

603
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:07,050
我很抱歉
I'm sorry...

604
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
但我希望你能再给马塞尔一次机会
But I need you to give Marcel another chance.

605
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,030
看来是我会错意了
Wow. I totally misread that.

606
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,910
不  你看的很准
No. You read it quite well,

607
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,130
但我们都有自己的角色要扮演
But we all have our roles to play.

608
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,870
你去见了马塞尔  与他共舞
You went to Marcel's. You danced.

609
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,130
你为他与朋友争执感到难过
You feel badly that he had a row with his friend,

610
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,320
但除此以外  你只记得他很完美
But otherwise, all you remember is that it was perfect.

611
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,480
今晚真是彻底的失败
Well, tonight was an epic failure.

612
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,570
恰恰相反  妹妹
On the contrary, sister.

613
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,090
今晚成功极了
Tonight was a masterpiece.

614
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,330
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

615
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,600
凯蒂在索菲完成咒语前死了
Katie died before Sophie could complete the spell.

616
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,510
我很清楚  我杀了凯蒂
Oh, I'm well aware. I killed Katie.

617
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,040
你干了什么
You what?

618
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,970
我们寻死的小女巫没理由
There's no way our little suicide witch

619
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,540
不试图让马塞尔和她陪葬
wasn't gonna try and take out Marcel with her.

620
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,670
我救了他的命  正因如此
I saved his life, and in doing so,

621
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,510
他正遂我愿
I now have him exactly where I want him.

622
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,350
索菲信任你
Sophie trusted you.

623
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,700
我信任你  而不是我更靠谱的本能
I trusted you against all my better instincts.

624
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,320
醒醒吧  丽贝卡
Wake up, Rebekah.

625
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,310
女巫们只为她们自己谋划
The witches are on no one's side but their own.

626
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,240
她们只想得到达维娜这个姑娘
This girl Davina, that's all they want,

627
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,010
当她们拥有了她  你觉得会怎样
and when they have her, what do you think happens then?

628
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,090
休战吗  当然不是
A truce? Of course not.

629
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,200
他们会用达维娜的力量对抗我们所有人
They will use Davina's power against all of us.

630
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,120
即便你说得对  计划是找到以利亚
Even if you're right, the plan was to find Elijah,

631
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,200
而你让我们失望了
and you failed us.

632
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,770
你总对我缺乏信心
You always did lack faith.

633
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,510
由于保护马塞尔  他更信任我了
By protecting Marcel, I've cemented his trust,

634
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,860
信任到他同意把以利亚还给我们
so much so that he's agreed to return Elijah to us.

635
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,780
时机一到
And when the time is right,

636
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,950
等他告诉了我达维娜所有的事
when he has told me everything I need to know about Davina,

637
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,110
我要亲自掌控她
I will have her for myself.

638
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,200
我毫不怀疑
I have all the faith in the world

639
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,040
你能心想事成  尼克
that you'll get what you want, Nik.

640
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,960
你一直如此
You always do,

641
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,300
不管我们其他人付出的代价
no matter what it costs the rest of us.

642
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,070
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

643
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,930
你还好吗  我很担心
Are you ok? I was so worried.

644
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,510
谢谢
Thank you.

645
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,120
我感觉到了你所做的一切
Whatever you did, I felt it.

646
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,210
你帮助了我
You helped me.

647
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,240
是那些老家伙  对吗
It was the old ones, wasn't it?

648
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,820
其实克劳斯是今晚救我的人
Actually, Klaus is the one that saved me tonight.

649
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,720
我要纠正错误
I'm gonna make things right,

650
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,820
从归还他的哥哥开始
starting off by giving him his brother back.

651
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:02,770
不行
No. 

652
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,710
怎么了
What?

653
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:06,830
-达维娜  -不行
- Davina. - No.

654
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,560
你说过那帮老家伙很危险
You said the old ones were dangerous.

655
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,410
得知如何杀死他们前我不会归还他
I won't give him back until I know how to kill them.

656
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,280
我觉得你可能想知道
I thought you might like to know,

657
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,540
以利亚要回来了
Elijah is returning to us.

658
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,140
恭喜
Congratulations.

659
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,330
我想作恶多端也有好处
I guess being diabolical has its perks.

660
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,790
你不了解他  但你却想念他
You hardly know him, and yet you miss him.

661
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,870
我的哥哥为何
What is it about my brother

662
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:03,990
总能引人敬佩
that always inspires such instant admiration?

663
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,930
他对我很好
He was kind to me.

664
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,940
有时我会怀疑
There are moments when I doubt

665
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,060
我的家族能否得到救赎
if my family is capable of redemption...

666
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,790
我今天知道一件事
Hey, I learned something today.

667
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,470
我觉得是个女孩
I think it's a girl.

668
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,670
但每当我想放弃时
Yet each time that I am tempted to surrender,

669
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,840
我看到一丝善良
I see it, the glimmer of goodness

670
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,870
让我相信救赎
that allows me to believe.

671
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,810
{\an8}圣彼得街

672
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,210
你在跟踪我
You're following me.

673
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,270
也许是你挡了我的路
Maybe you're just in my way.

674
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,110
我告诉过你这帮罪恶的盟友
I told you no good would come

675
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,100
不会带来好处
from this unholy alliance of yours.

676
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,080
至少我有所作为
At least I'm doing something.

677
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:40,880
你呢
What about you?

678
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,330
萨宾  告诉他们你看到的
Sabine, tell them what you saw.

679
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,230
是那个狼人姑娘
It's the girl, the wolf.

680
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:58,810
我觉得是个女孩
I think it's a girl.

681
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,820
不  等等
No. Wait.

682
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,150
等什么
Wait what?

683
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,730
快告诉我这不是个小克劳斯
Please tell me I'm not having a mini Klaus.

684
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:15,140
[咒语]
Hoc est infantima malom.

685
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,860
