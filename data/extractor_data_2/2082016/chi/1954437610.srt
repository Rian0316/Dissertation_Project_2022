1
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:09,023
然后让反质子的自旋反向
And reverse the spin on the antiproton...

2
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:12,673
γ变成了α
and γ becomes α...

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:17,623
乘以矩阵(-i,0)
Multiplied by a matrix of (-i,0)...

4
00:00:17,623 --> 00:00:20,013
有成果了
And there we have it.

5
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:25,313
证明我九点过后就是一条废柴的证据
Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after 9 o'clock.

6
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:31,153
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

7
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,363
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

8
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:54,453
好了  好了
All right, all right.

9
00:00:54,453 --> 00:00:56,283
我看穿了你们的诡计
I see what's going on.

10
00:00:56,283 --> 00:00:59,923
万圣节前的装神弄鬼罢了
A little pre-Halloween hijinkery.

11
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:09,163
阴森的呜咽
A ghostly moan,

12
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,233
铁链的响声
a rattling of chains,

13
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,233
女巫的奸笑
a witch's cackle.

14
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:17,073
老套的鬼屋三元素
The trifecta of haunted house cliche.

15
00:01:17,073 --> 00:01:20,143
普通人尖叫  哥只想睡觉
Instead of "eek," I say, "yawn."

16
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:26,153
谢尔顿...
Sheldon...

17
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:32,123
滴血之墙
Oh, the walls are dripping blood,

18
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:35,323
看上去假得就像把碳酸钠溶液
which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator

19
00:01:32,123 --> 00:01:38,363
碳酸钠溶液呈碱性  遇酚酞变红

20
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,363
滴进了酚酞里一样
exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.

21
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,683
"我们地狱里见谢尔顿"
"See you in hell Sheldon."

22
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:49,293
这话最恐怖的地方  是你忘了加逗号了
The most frightening thing about that is the missing comma.

23
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:55,943
好  很好
Okay, all right.

24
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:58,283
这招高
That one was clever.

25
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:01,813
缆绳上挂着个含磷的骨架
Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line.

26
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,553
现身吧  快活的恶作剧者们[也是乐队名]
Come on out, merry pranksters.

27
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,623
该谢幕了
Take a bow.

28
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:12,393
你真该看看你刚才的表情
You should've seen your face.

29
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:16,163
有什么呀  不过就是稍稍受到惊吓
Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes

30
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:18,403
然后瞳孔小小地放大了一点
of mildly startled.

31
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:19,793
你就承认吧  谢尔顿
Come on, admit it.

32
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,963
我们吓着你了
We got you, Sheldon.

33
00:02:20,963 --> 00:02:24,723
拜托  惊吓惊吓  有惊才有吓
Please, fright depends on an element of surprise.

34
00:02:24,723 --> 00:02:26,063
而事实是
The simple fact is,

35
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:28,073
在能未卜先知的我面前
because I am much smarter than you,

36
00:02:28,073 --> 00:02:30,303
你们两个臭皮匠的烂招  只是笑话
and able to anticipate your actions,

37
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,863
想吓到我诸葛亮
it is highly unlikely that you two rubes

38
00:02:32,863 --> 00:02:34,883
门都没有
could ever surprise me.

39
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:36,883
他说的对吧
He's probably right.

40
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:39,703
我们吓不倒他  他太聪明了
We can't beat him. He's just too smart.

41
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:40,763
先生们
Gentlemen.

42
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,433
谁刚才赌他会晕倒来着
Who had money on "faints"?

43
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,583
我赌的是尿裤子
I had "pee his pants."

44
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,823
等等
Hang on.

45
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:54,013
看来我们都赌中了
Looks like everyone's a winner.

46

生活大爆炸  第五季第七集

55
00:03:19,138 --> 00:03:19,978
当心了  谢尔顿
Oh. Watch out, Sheldon.

56
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:23,818
这个《鬼马小精灵》可是个鬼-鬼-鬼-鬼啊
This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!

57
00:03:24,578 --> 00:03:25,978
可笑
Droll.

58
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:27,818
那也可笑不过一个成年人
Not as droll as a grown man

59
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,018
晕倒在自己的一滩尿上
passed out in a puddle of his own urine.

60
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:33,058
的确太可笑了
That was pretty droll.

61
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,888
尿液中含氨

62
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,888
笑声中还带着一丝氨气的芬芳
With a hint of ammonia.

63
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:39,018
接着沾沾自喜着吓人的胜果吧  先生们
Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen.

64
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,758
觉得自己吓倒了一名胆小的大学学者
You think you've poked fun at a milquetoast academic.

65
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,358
可你们忘了一件事
Well, you've forgotten one thing:

66
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,728
我可是孤星州[德州别称]之子
I am also a son of the Lone Star state.

67
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,898
我可是彻头彻尾的德州人
I'm Texas through and through.

68
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:50,648
我们可会修理人了
And we know how to settle scores down there.

69
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:54,318
不信就去问  常被我们修理的墨西哥人
If you doubt me, ask Mexico.

70
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:59,268
辣妹出没  九点钟方向
Hot girl, nine o'clock.

71
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:02,408
别同时抬头看人家
Don't everybody look at once!

72
00:04:04,748 --> 00:04:06,218
她来漫画书店做什么
What is she doing in a comic book store?

73
00:04:06,218 --> 00:04:10,098
我不清楚  估计是迷路了
I don't know, she might be lost.

74
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:14,808
无所谓了  都学着点儿
Doesn't matter. Watch and learn.

75
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:21,768
-你好啊  -你好
- Hi.  - Hi.

76
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,828
呃...呃...呃
... it-it-it...

77
00:04:33,268 --> 00:04:35,078
都闭嘴
Shut up.

78
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:38,708
你要买这期《Next Men》吗
Are you getting this Next Men?

79
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:40,608
是的  这是第二十一期的那本
Uh, yeah. It's issue number 21.

80
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:41,818
地狱男爵第一次登场的那期
First appearance of Hellboy.

81
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:44,548
我知道  我找了它很多年
I know. I've been looking for it for years.

82
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:47,618
-抱歉了  -要是我假装来泡你
- Sorry.  - Hey, if I pretended to hit on you,

83
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,518
我的美貌够不够让你分心  好让我把书偷走
could I distract you enough to sneak it away?

84
00:04:51,788 --> 00:04:55,098
够的  但滥用超能美貌做坏事是不对的
Yes, but you'd be using your superpowers for evil.

85
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:58,828
该死  我在氪星的老爸禁止我用能力使坏
Damn, I'm forbidden by my Kryptonian father to do so.

86
00:04:55,098 --> 00:04:58,828
Kryptonian  超人家族所在星系

87
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,338
我叫爱丽丝
I'm Alice.

88
00:05:01,338 --> 00:05:02,698
我叫莱纳德
Leonard.

89
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,438
你真可爱  莱纳德
You're very cute, Leonard.

90
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:05,108
谢谢  你也是
Thanks. You, too.

91
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:07,108
这书你拿去吧
You know, go ahead and take it.

92
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:11,208
不  不行  这样我就做坏事了
No, no. No, no, I-I did evil.

93
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,078
你接受以物易物吗
Would you be open to a trade?

94
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,848
可以  没问题
Yeah, yeah, sure, I guess.

95
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:16,218
好吧  给
Okay. Here.

96
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:18,418
这是我的电话号码
This is my number.

97
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:19,888
记得打给我
Call me.

98
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:22,358
抱歉  手掌有点出汗
Sorry, palm's a little sweaty.

99
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:23,588
那是个什么词儿呀
What's that word?

100
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:26,628
-爱丽丝  -对哦  你的名字
- Alice.  - Oh, right, your name.

101
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,998
刚看成"爱鸡鸡"还纳闷呢
That makes more sense than "Penis".

102
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,688
回见了
Later.

103
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:37,298
我们亲眼目睹到你在漫画店成功把到妹吗
Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?

104
00:05:37,308 --> 00:05:39,368
如果是真的  我要把你的肖像
'Cause if you did, you get your picture up there

105
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:41,238
挂在英雄榜上
on the Wall of Heroes.

106
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,648
没有吧  应该没有把到她
No, I don't think I picked her up.

107
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,628
更何况我还有家室呢
Besides, I have a girlfriend.

108
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:46,778
无所谓  你算是最成功的一个了
Doesn't matter. This is the closest anyone's ever come.

109
00:05:46,778 --> 00:05:48,718
你入榜了  伙计
You're going on the wall, my friend.

110
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,616
一定要开信箱
Be sure to check the mail.

111
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:57,196
你还要提醒我几次呀
How many times are you gonna tell me?

112
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,996
-你没事吧  -没事
- What's with you? - Nothing.

113
00:05:58,996 --> 00:06:00,886
我锲而不舍有什么奇怪的
It's not suspicious that I'm fixating.

114
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:02,816
我个性向来坚持不懈
It's consistent with my personality.

115
00:06:03,856 --> 00:06:05,076
好吧
Right.

116
00:06:05,076 --> 00:06:05,726
伙计们
Hey, guys.

117
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,926
又买万圣节糖果了啊
More Halloween candy?

118
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:08,336
你昨天不是刚买了一堆吗
Didn't you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?

119
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,756
那堆啊  吃完了
Oh. Yeah. That's gone.

120
00:06:12,536 --> 00:06:14,626
万圣节和大姨妈一起来
It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS

121
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,606
我是屋漏偏逢连夜雨呀
hit at the same time.

122
00:06:17,686 --> 00:06:19,066
莱纳德没时间聊天
Leonard doesn't have time to chat,

123
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:20,126
他要去开信箱
he has to get the mail.

124
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,716
你就不能消停会吗  我马上就开
Will you relax? I'll get it in a minute.

125
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,826
-你工作怎么样了  -快开信箱
- How was work?  - Open the mail!

126
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,316
等我一下
Excuse me.

127
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:37,736
几份广告而已  没什么重要的东西
A couple of circulars, nothing important.

128
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,426
-他怎么了  -等着瞧
- What's with him? - Hang on.

129
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:54,586
你是德州人又怎样  哥还是新泽西人呢
You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.

130
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,146
看这个
Check it out.

131
00:06:59,146 --> 00:07:03,566

两年前的动漫展上吉姆・李帮我画的

136
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:15,246
哇  肯定有不少女生对你"投怀送抱"吧
Wow, you must have gotten so laid.

137
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:18,976
没有  但洁西卡・阿尔芭有揉我毛毛的肚子
No. But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.

138
00:07:21,206 --> 00:07:23,576
要看看我画的漫画吗
Want to see a comic I draw?

139
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,656
开玩笑吧  你自己有画漫画啊
You're kidding. You have your own book?

140
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,166
是的  灵感是来自我的生活
Yeah. It's kinda based on my life.

141
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,556
厉害啊
Cool.

142

在动漫展上吗
Comic Con?

146
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:42,376
你以为是  不过非也
You'd think, but no.

147
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,336
你真有才  画得真好
You're very talented. This is really good.

148

你是不是...
Did you do...

149
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:56,846
我能用我的漫画换你的《地狱男爵》吗
So, can I trade you my comic for the Hellboy?

150
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:59,296
换我车子都行
You can have my car.

151
00:08:13,947 --> 00:08:15,407

我的老天爷啊
Oh, dear...

153
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:24,017
妈啊  妈啊  妈啊
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear...

154
00:08:24,017 --> 00:08:26,377
救命啊  救命啊  救命啊
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

155
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:30,117
洗手液  洗手液  洗手液  洗手液
Purell, Purell, Purell, Purell.

156
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:47,547
早上好  谢尔顿
Good morning, Sheldon.

157
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:49,647
今早是好啊
It is, isn't it?

158
00:08:56,777 --> 00:08:59,027
哎呀  讨厌
Oh, bother.

159
00:08:59,027 --> 00:09:01,007
每次都这样
Isn't that just always the way?

160
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,737
要用订书机  才发现没钉书针了
You go to staple something, and you're out of staples.

161
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:08,637
史泰博:  美国著名办公用品品牌  与订书针同字

162
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,947
老天  要是我早些在史泰博的时候
Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today

163
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,637
知道就好了
when I was at Staples.

164
00:09:09,317 --> 00:09:11,867
那里有回形针啊
You ever think of paper clips right there?

165
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:16,437
不  我需要能把纸钉牢的东西
No, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers.

166
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:21,417
你不是把订书钉放在第一格抽屉的吗
Say, don't you keep staples in your top desk drawer?

167
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,177
不知道  也许吧
I don't know. Maybe.

168
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:26,277
行行好  看一下嘛
Be a lamb and check.

169
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,697
好吧
All right.

170
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:34,487
是哪个小可爱躲在这呀
Who do we have here?

171
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,117
是条蛇  一条吓人的蛇
It's a snake. A terrifying snake.

172
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:43,217
是不是哪个坏蛋把你丢到抽屉里啦
Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?

173
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,767
别装可爱说话了
Stop talking like that.

174
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:47,547
你应该被吓得说不出话来才对
You've been rendered speechless by fear.

175
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,767
咱们去生物实验室
Let's go to the biology lab

176
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:53,637
给你搞点美味的小白鼠来吃吧
and find you some nice yummy mice.

177
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,237
我居然想用蛇来吓唬印度佬
I tried to scare an Indian with a snake.

178
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:01,617
加油啊  库珀  你就这么点能耐吗
Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.

179
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,787
门没锁
It's open.

180
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,167
你现在有空吗
Hey, you got a minute?

181
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:10,497
当然  进来吧
Yeah, sure, come on in.

182
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,267
谢了
Thanks.

183
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,957
来点芝士通心粉吗
Want some mac and cheese?

184
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,877
不了  有乳糖  吃了会放屁
No. Lactose. Gas.

185
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,277
-酒呢  -不了  有亚硝酸盐  喝了会头痛
- Glass of wine?  - No. Sulfites. Migraines.

186
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:22,647
好吧  我本来想给你吃万圣节糖果
Okay, well, I'd offer you Halloween candy,

187
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,427
不过都吃完了
but that's gone.

188
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:26,667
怎么了
So, what's up?

189
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,837
好吧  我们以前不是约过会吗
Okay, we used to go out, right?

190
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,067
老天  总算想起来你是谁了
Oh, my God, that's where I know you from.

191
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:34,947
我碰到了点难题
I'm dealing with a situation

192
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:37,347
是跟感情有关的
and it's kind of about my love life,

193
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,017
我知道咱俩谈这个  可能有点尴尬
so I know that might be weird for us to talk about,

194
00:10:40,017 --> 00:10:41,247
但在这方面  你也知道
but in this area, as you know,

195
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:44,987
我其他的朋友实在是  蠢得可以
all my other friends are just so stupid.

196
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:47,087
好吧  怎么回事
All right, what's going on?

197
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:48,687
这么不介意我跟你谈吗
So, you're okay talking about this?

198
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:50,157
-当然  -你不会觉得尴尬吧
- Yes. - You're sure it's not weird.

199
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:51,587
真的不会
It's okay.

200
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:53,067
好吧  如果有天你想和我谈
You know what, if you ever want to talk to me

201
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,067
你跟男人的感情问题
about a problem in your life with a guy,

202
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,667
我也愿意听
then I would be fine with that.

203
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,467
那好  现在就有个我以前好过的小子
Okay, good, because there's this one guy I used to date

204
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,067
他要是再这样拐弯抹角
who's about to be force-fed wine and cheese

205
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,767
我就要灌他吃红酒和芝士
if he doesn't get to the point.

206
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,737
好吧
Okay,

207
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:06,577
是这样的
here it is.

208
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:08,947
这样算不算偷腥  如果一个男的有女朋友
Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriend...

209
00:11:08,947 --> 00:11:10,807
应该算的
Yeah, probably.

210
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:13,297
别这样嘛
Come on.

211
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,437
对不起  你说
I'm sorry, go ahead.

212
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:17,037
我新认识一个女孩子  她人很好
I met this girl, and she's great.

213
00:11:17,037 --> 00:11:18,397
跟我有很多共同话题
we have a lot in common.

214
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:19,697
那你们搞了吗
Did you guys do it?

215
00:11:19,697 --> 00:11:21,797
没有  只是亲热了一下下
No. We just made out a little.

216
00:11:21,797 --> 00:11:25,147
哎呦  瞧你个小坏蛋
Oh, look at you, you bad boy.

217
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:26,347
你跟她提过普丽娅吗
Did you tell her about Priya?

218
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:30,057
我也想提  可她的舌头在我嘴里呢
Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth.

219
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:33,037
真恶心
That's gross.

220
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:36,947
现在的情况是
Here's the thing,

221
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,147
我不是那种四处偷腥
I-I'm not one of those guys who sneaks around

222
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:41,077
拈花惹草的男人
and sleeps with more than one woman.

223
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:42,177
好孩子
Well, good for you.

224
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:45,077
可问题是  我想成为那种男人
The problem is, I want to be one of those guys.

225
00:11:46,797 --> 00:11:48,787
那就瞒着普丽娅  把那女的睡了
So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.

226
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:50,387
我不是那种人
Oh, that's not who I am.

227
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,687
那好  那就跟那女的一刀两断
All right, then break it off with the new girl.

228
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:54,187
也别草率行事
Now, let's not do anything rash.

229
00:11:54,197 --> 00:11:56,297
她真的很正点
She's really hot.

230
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:57,897
既然你这么喜欢这个女孩子
If you like this girl so much,

231
00:11:57,897 --> 00:11:59,697
那干嘛不跟普利娅分手
why don't you just end things with Priya?

232
00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:01,297
普丽娅和我深爱对方
Priya and I are in love.

233
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:03,627
我们以后说不定会结婚呢
I think we could get married someday.

234
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:06,227
莱纳德  你是想找个两全其美的办法
Leonard, you're looking for a way to sleep with both women

235
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:07,947
好让你左拥右抱
and have everybody be happy about it.

236
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:09,917
终于说到点上了
Now we're getting somewhere.

237
00:12:13,117 --> 00:12:14,757
你的第一直觉是什么
What does your gut tell you?

238
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:17,387
"去问佩妮  她知道该怎么做"
"Go ask Penny; she'll know what to do."

239
00:12:26,047 --> 00:12:27,737
你好  霍华德
Hello, Howard.

240
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:31,547
我知道你们吓我是闹着玩的
I've realized that you scaring me was all in jest.

241
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:35,127
请容许我说  吓得很成功
Allow me to say, job well done.

242
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,037
完美
Perfect.

243
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:52,887
你在干嘛呢
What are you doing?

244
00:12:52,887 --> 00:12:55,317
搞科研呢  你不会懂的
Science. You wouldn't understand.

245
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,217
那好  再见  我出门了
Hey, well, see you. I'm going out.

246
00:13:06,857 --> 00:13:09,647
我以为你是要出门呢
I thought you were leaving the apartment.

247
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:12,467
我也以为  可我下不了决心
Yeah, me, too. I can't make up my mind.

248
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:14,737
你是不是担心外面的世界
Are you concerned because the world is filled

249
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:16,857
充满着疯狗和坏蛋
with big dogs and bullies?

250
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:21,857
不是  我正面临道德上的难题
No. I'm having a moral crisis.

251
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:23,767
如果需要帮忙的话
Well, if it's of any help,

252
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,937
我读过各种伦理学家的著作
I've read all the great moral philosophers,

253
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:29,207
美国著名作家及漫画家  以儿童书出名

254
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:29,207
包括苏斯博士的书哦
including Dr. Seuss.

255
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:32,817
死马当活马医吧
Oh, what the hell.

256
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:34,607
我本来要去见
I'm supposed to go see that girl

257
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:36,807
在漫画书店认识的那个女孩子  爱丽丝
from the comic book store, Alice,

258
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:37,997
可我不知道该不该去
but I don't know if I should,

259
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,127
因为我现在跟普利娅在一起
because I'm going out with Priya,

260
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,737
可她人又远在印度
but she's in India.

261
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:45,787
好吧  这么说现在的主题是性忠贞
All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.

262
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:48,437
苏斯博士在这方面估计靠不住
Probably won't be relying on Seuss here.

263
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:51,407
苏斯博士1960年著作

264
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:51,407
不过《一条鱼  两条鱼  红色的鱼  蓝色的鱼》
Although <i>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</i>

265
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:53,657
倒可能惊人的适用
might be surprisingly applicable.

266
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,537
继续
Go on.

267
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:57,457
那个
Well...

268
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,197
别人都说  人到了暮年
they say at the end of your life,

269
00:13:59,197 --> 00:14:00,727
比起自己做过的事
you regret the stuff you didn't do

270
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:02,417
会更后悔没有做过一些事
more than the stuff that you did,

271
00:14:02,417 --> 00:14:06,407
而我非常确定我很想跟爱丽丝"做"
and I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do.

272
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:11,517
德国哲学家弗里德里希・尼采
You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche,

273
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,987
相信道德只是低等人群体
believed that morality is just a fiction

274
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,757
用来阻碍少数高等人的
used by the herd of inferior human beings

275
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:21,697
虚构事物
to hold back the few superior men.

276
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,047
死马还真给医活了
That actually does help.

277
00:14:24,047 --> 00:14:27,117
值得一提的是  他后来死于梅毒
It's worth noting that he died of syphilis.

278
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:33,907
-管他呢  我去也  -你回家的路上
- Screw it, I'm going.   - On your way home,

279
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,177
-能不能买点橙汁回来  -拜托
- will you pick up some orange juice? - Do you mind?

280
00:14:36,177 --> 00:14:38,217
我正在质疑我人生中很多的人事物呢
I'm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.

281
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:42,087
你喜欢橙汁也需要质疑吗
Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?

282
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:44,507
-不用  -那就对了  纯果乐  要没果肉的
- No.  - Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

283
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,567
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

284
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:56,267
谁啊
Who is it!

285
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,577
沃罗威茨太太  是我  谢尔顿
It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.

286
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:01,697
那不是我妈  是伯纳黛特
That's not my mom, it's Bernadette.

287
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:06,397
真的吗  真分不出来
Really? That's very unsettling.

288
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:07,957
嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

289
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,777
-嗨  -有事吗
- Hi.  - What's up?

290
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:14,307
我刚想到  我一直都还没正式恭祝过
It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you

291
00:15:14,307 --> 00:15:15,727
你们即将到来的婚事
on your pending nuptials.

292
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:16,767
于是我跳上首班车
So I hopped on

293
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,407
一路狂奔过来跟你握手道贺
the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand.

294
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:23,187
快把手伸过来  你这家伙
Put 'er there, you old so-and-so.

295
00:15:23,677 --> 00:15:26,767
再过12小时  咱俩就一起上班了
Well, I-I'm gonna see you at work in...12 hours

296
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,457
你怎么不等上班了再跟我握手呢
don't you think it could have waited until then?

297
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:33,337
我的老天  我怎么就没想到呢
Holy smoke, why didn't I think of that?

298
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,577
你果然比我聪明  霍华德・沃罗威茨
You're a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz.

299
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:38,147
快把手伸出来  你个小聪明
You put 'er there, you son of a gun!

300
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:40,757
那随你吧
Whatever.

301
00:15:41,717 --> 00:15:43,377
天啊
My...oh...

302
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,597
我
it's...

303
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,697
天啊  霍华德
Oh, my God, Howard!

304
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,797
你对他做了什么
What did you do?

305
00:15:49,797 --> 00:15:52,247
只是个无恶意的万圣节恶作剧而已  看
It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.

306
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:55,107
霍华德有心脏病  你又不是不知道
Howard has a heart condition! You know that!

307
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,297
我还以为他那是瞎编的呢
Well, I thought he made that up.

308
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,777
犹太人不是常有
I-Isn't hypochondria

309
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,607
疑病症的问题吗
a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?

310
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,037
这是肾上腺素
This is adrenaline --

311
00:16:06,037 --> 00:16:07,947
我们得把这个注射到他的心脏里
we're gonna have to inject it into his heart.

312
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:09,377
-我们得做吗  -是你做
- We are?  - You are.

313
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,317
我可没那么大劲扎穿他的胸腔
I'm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate,

314
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,507
而且机会只有一次
and we've only got one shot.

315
00:16:13,507 --> 00:16:17,047
不  我做不来
Oh, no! I can't!

316
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:17,557
快点
Hurry!

317
00:16:17,557 --> 00:16:19,637
咱们时间不多了
We're running out of time!

318
00:16:20,607 --> 00:16:21,277
-好吧  -快扎呀
- Okay.  - Just do it!

319
00:16:21,277 --> 00:16:23,137
上帝啊
Oh, God!

320
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,997
一  二
One...two...

321
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,837
三
three!

322
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,557
不给糖就捣蛋  笨蛋
Trick or treat, bubbeleh.

323
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:30,897
什么
What?

324
00:16:32,397 --> 00:16:35,297
不是吧  你们居然设局耍我
No. You mean this was all a ruse?

325
00:16:35,297 --> 00:16:39,087
我怎么会笨成这...
Oh, how could I be so stu...

326
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:47,177
该死的  不行
Damn it, I can't.

327
00:16:47,177 --> 00:16:48,727
我不能这样
I can't do this.

328
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:49,897
是因为我的舌环吗
Uh, is it my tongue stud?

329
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:51,067
要是有穿舌环就会吓到你
'Cause if that freaks you out,

330
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:52,857
那待会儿你会更大吃一惊哦
you're in for a real surprise later on.

331
00:16:52,857 --> 00:16:54,177
不  不是
No, no, no.

332
00:16:54,177 --> 00:16:56,407
是我不能跟你这样
I-I can't do this.

333
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,617
相信我  我真的很想
Believe me, I really want to.

334
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,547
-但是呢  -但是我有女朋友了
- But...?  - But I kind of have a girlfriend.

335
00:17:01,547 --> 00:17:02,587
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

336
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,277
你不介意咱俩只做朋友吧
You're cool with you and me just being friends, right?

337
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:06,717
我真不敢相信
I don't believe this.

338
00:17:06,717 --> 00:17:09,747
等等  我...你不相信哪部分
Wait, I don't... Which part?

339
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,417
我真是笨到家了
I'm so stupid.

340
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:12,697
我还以为我终于遇上了个好人呢
I thought for once I'd met a good guy,

341
00:17:12,697 --> 00:17:14,287
结果你也只不过又是一个混蛋而已
but you're just another jackass.

342
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:17,407
不  不  你误会了
Oh, no, no, you have it wrong.

343
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,987
不  我本来是要当个混蛋
No. I-I was going to be a jackass,

344
00:17:19,987 --> 00:17:22,227
但是我克制住了
but I stopped myself.

345
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:24,867
我决定做个好人  所以
I stayed a good guy, so...

346
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,837
我还是不跟你滚床单了
I'm gonna pass on the sex.

347
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,197
但是你要知道  这并不代表你不够辣
But you should know, that's not a comment on your hotness

348
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:32,837
这只是说明我品德高尚
but on my goodness.

349
00:17:32,837 --> 00:17:34,367
这也算是我的超能力了吧
That's kind of my superpower.

350
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,387
我就像是  好人队长
I'm, like, Captain Good Guy.

351
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:42,697
没啥了不起的
It's okay.

352
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:45,217
做了对的选择
Did the right thing.

353
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:48,067
我悔得肠子都青了
You idiot!

354
00:17:51,316 --> 00:17:52,766
普丽娅
Hey, Priya.

355
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:54,246
亲爱的  一切都好吗
Hey, sweetheart. How's it going?

356
00:17:54,246 --> 00:17:55,446
不怎么样
Uh, not so good.

357
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:56,746
咱俩得谈谈
We have to talk.

358
00:17:56,746 --> 00:18:00,196
好像很严重的样子啊  怎么了
Oh, sounds serious. What's up?

359
00:18:00,196 --> 00:18:03,436
好吧  事情是这样的
Okay, uh...here it is.

360
00:18:03,436 --> 00:18:05,246
我认识了一个女生  我们接吻了
I met this girl and I kissed her,

361
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:06,546
我觉得很内疚
and I feel terrible about it.

362
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:08,686
但都结束了  绝无下次
But it's done, it's never gonna happen again.

363
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:11,326
我真的非常非常抱歉
And I am so, so sorry.

364
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,926
莱纳德  别紧张
Leonard, relax.

365
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:13,726
没事的
It's okay.

366
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,886
真的吗
It is?

367
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,536
是啊  这种事情很正常
Yeah, these things happen.

368
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:18,746
人之常情嘛
They happen to everybody.

369
00:18:18,746 --> 00:18:21,776
天啊  你真是太好了
Oh, my God, you are amazing.

370
00:18:21,776 --> 00:18:23,766
我怎么这么命好呀
I mean, I don't deserve you.

371
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:26,296
等  等会  你说"人之常情"是什么意思
Wh-what do you mean "everybody"?

372
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:31,146
莱纳德  我不知道该不该说
Leonard, I didn't know if I should tell you,

373
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:34,336
不过我好像也背叛你了
but I kind of cheated on you, too.

374
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:36,876
什么叫好像
Kind of?

375
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:39,426
几周前
A couple of weeks ago,

376
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:42,466
我跟我前男友上床了
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

377
00:18:42,466 --> 00:18:45,466
所以说  我们俩都犯了点小错误
So, I guess we both messed up a little.

378
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:50,666
不  我是犯了点小错  你可是犯了大错
No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot.

379
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:52,926
咱这又不是在比赛
Well, it's not a competition.

380
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:57,996
就是比赛  而且你赢了
Oh...yeah, it is, and you won.

381
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:01,566
对  对不起  我要下线了
I-I-I'm sorry, I have to go.

382
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:05,386
老天爷你玩我啊
I don't believe this.

383
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,926
吓到了吧  小混蛋  现在我们扯平了
Bazinga, punk. Now we're even.
