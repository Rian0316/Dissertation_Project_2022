For what are you getting 2 grand?

212
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,004
It was for going after your grandma,

213
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,870
just for taking a header over
her car and then b-bracing her.

He stole a million and
a half bucks from the county.

230

He's gonna be indicted
for embezzlement any day now.

I'll get my name out, and...

233
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,084
Anyway, I thought if I had these two

Just me. [Chuckles]

Tuco freaked you out, huh?

746

It's cool. He doesn't know I'm here.

747
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,010
So, uh... what can I do for you?

748
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,180
I've been thinking about what you said

749

out there in the desert.

750

Those people
that you were trying to scam...

751

How much did they steal?

752
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:42,825
Um, north of a million
and a half bucks... I think.

753
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:49,198
So, they have a million
and a half bucks somewhere.

754
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,199
In what, cash?

755
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,535
I don't... well...

756
00:42:52,537 --> 00:42:55,171
Why are you asking me?

757
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:59,008
- I'm gonna rip them off.
- Oh.

758
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,843
I like ripping off thieves

759
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:04,213
'cause they can't go to the
cops... they have no recourse.

760

Mm.

761
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,684
You point me
at where they have their cash...

762
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,686
I'll pay you... a what do you call it?...

763
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:15,641
A finder's fee... call it 10%, 100 large.

Well, uh, why w... why would you
come to me for that?

765
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:25,485
You already tried ripping them off.

766
00:43:25,537 --> 00:43:28,037
I'm gonna finish what you started.

767
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,872
I... I wasn't trying to rip them off.

768

- Okay. [Chuckles]
- [Sighs]

770

nobody gets hurt.

I crossed a line. I made a mistake.

778
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,986
I'm not doing that again, not ever.

779
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:03,189
I got between you and tuco.

780
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:06,576
Do you think you'd be here
now... I kept my mouth shut?

781
00:44:06,611 --> 00:44:10,780
And I appreciate that. I owe you.

God forbid,<i> legal</i> trouble,

785
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:25,294
No... no angle. [Chuckles]

786
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:28,931
And I'm not saying anything
about this to anybody.

787

789

is privileged.
