00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,533
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
KLAUS: Previously on The Originals ;

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,400
这座城市曾经是我的家
我要夺回来
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:08,006
这城市已习惯了有国王的统治
The city grew accustomed
to having a king.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,972
既然你想要这个宝座
You wanted this throne.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,907
如果你不愿意做的话，那我来
If you won't do anything, I will.

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,606
基兰是我唯一的亲人
我受够了总是一个人
Kieran's the only family I have left.
I'm tired of being alone.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,917
你本来是个收获祭女孩
但或许你不属于这里
You're supposed to be a Harvest girl,
but maybe you don't belong here.

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,578
战争一触即发，小提
A battle is brewing, T.

9
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,189
大家都忙着选择阵营
While everyone's busy choosing sides,

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,087
我会想办法夺回我们的城市
I'm gonna find a way
to take back our city.

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,091
日光戒指保护吸血鬼不受阳光侵害
KLAUS: Daylight rings shield
vampires from the sun,

12
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:32,460
那为什么不能有一个月光戒指
保护狼人免受诅咒之苦呢？
so why not a moonlight ring to
protect werewolves from the curse?

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,066
你和克劳斯米卡森做了交易？
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,498
我们最终可以控制自己
We could finally control what we are.

15
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:39,400
猎杀我们的人类
诅咒我们的女巫
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

16
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,131
憎恨我们的吸血鬼
the vampires who hate us,

17
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,675
我们将不再只与他们势均力敌
我们将统治他们
we wouldn't just be their equals.
We'd be their superiors.

18
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,713
你起得真早
You're up early.

19
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,515
激情了一夜，我以为你会多睡会呢
After the night we had,
I expected you to sleep in.

20
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:00,092
是啊，但清晨的阳光是最佳的作画光源
Yes, well, morning sun
offers the best light.

21
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,520
别动
Hold still.

22
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:06,295
我快完成了
I'm almost finished.

23
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,000
如果在前世，这么赤裸着躺在这里
一定让我害羞死了
In my last life, I was far too
modest if I was in the nude.

24
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:14,572
那你可真是进步不少
Well, then consider
yourself much improved.

25
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,309
害羞是弱者才有的表现
Modesty is for the weak.

26
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:29,811
- 你不给我看看吗？
- 这幅画是一份礼物
-Well, are you gonna show me?
-The painting is a gift.

27
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:33,790
一份庆祝我们结盟的贺礼
A token to honor our pact.

28
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,458
我们的结盟？
昨晚如此美妙
Our pact?
We had such a lovely night

29
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,394
却只是你为达目的而使的手段
and now I see it was
all a means to an end.

30
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:44,128
一个能达到双赢目的的美好手段
A rather delicious means
to a mutually beneficial end.

31
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,704
告诉我，除了昨晚的欢愉
Tell me.
Beyond the pleasures of last night

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,003
和你承诺送给我的杰作
and the promise of what
I'm sure is an exquisite painting,

33
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,134
与你结盟对法语区的女巫们来说
what exactly would
a French Quarter witch gain

34
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,973
还有什么好处？
from aligning with you?

35
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,480
我亲爱的哥哥与城市里
Well, the treaty my
dear brother negotiated

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,447
各方势力所签下的协定
between the warring
factions of this city,

37
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:01,145
就是你亲自签名的那份
the one that you yourself signed.

38
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,287
尽管大家都有心遵守
但毕竟这里…
No doubt everyone means well,
but this is after all--

39
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,757
仍然是法语区？
-Still the French Quarter?
-(CHUCKLES)

40
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:10,488
一个充满着宿敌的城市
A borough rife with natural enemies.

41
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,360
你和你的女巫们需要的
What you and your witches need

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,435
是只有我能提供给你们的保护
is the protection only I can provide.

43
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,594
没有人，无论是吸血鬼还是狼人
No one.... not vampires,
not werewolves,

44
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:22,333
有我站在你们这边
就算是我哥哥也不敢招惹你们
not even my brother will dare trifle
with you if I am on your side.

45
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,806
作为交换…
And in exchange...

46
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:30,404
你要我给你什么呢？
...I am to offer you what, exactly?

47
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,981
我只希望你保证对我效忠
All I ask is for the promise
of your allegiance.

48
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,922
能有一个强大的女巫盟友总是有备无患
One never knows when a powerful
witch might come in handy.

49
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,160
我同意
Well, then.

50
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,496
莫妮克，你还好吗？
Monique, are you OK?

51
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:23,193
莫妮克，你听起来像是被附身了
Monique, you sounded like
you were possessed.

52
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,361
我没有被附身
I wasn't possessed.

53
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,564
我是在跟祖先们交流
I was channeling the ancestors.

54
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,005
他们说是时候完成收割仪式了
They say it's time
to complete the reaping.

55
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,405
为此，第四个收获祭女孩必须复活
To do that, the fourth Harvest
girl must be resurrected,

56
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,143
也就是说，洁妮薇必须死
which means...
it's time for Genevieve to die.

57
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:46,558
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：极度不安

58
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,328
我真是受够这些噪音了
Enough with all the racket!

59
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,729
有什么问题吗，弟弟？
主演：约瑟夫摩根
Is there a problem, brother?

60
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,893
各位，先离开好吗？
Gentlemen, please.

61
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,367
我只同意让你简单装修一下
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
I agreed to a general sprucing up,

62
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,462
不是让你在这搭个马戏团
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
not a bloody three ring circus.

63
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,199
不是让你在这搭个马戏团
not a bloody three ring circus.

64
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,137
大半个世纪来，马赛尔和他的手下
主演：菲比托金
Marcel and his minions
abused our home

65
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,938
对我们的家肆意践踏
主演：菲比托金
for the better part of a century.

66
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,602
或许你愿意住在这种废墟里，但我可不
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Now, you might be content
to live in squalor. I'm not.

67
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,179
我同意你哥哥说的
I agree with your brother.

68
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,282
法语区已进入了新时代
主演：莉雅派普斯
It's a new era in the French Quarter.

69
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,680
这地方也该好好翻新一下了
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
This place could use a makeover.

70
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,118
小心点，以利亚
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
Careful, Elijah.

71
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,781
当这女人同意你的说法时
说明她必有所图
When this one agrees with you, it's
a sure sign she wants something.

72
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,487
事实上…
我的确有个请求
Actually....
I do have a request.

73
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:24,961
我听说自从马赛尔限制女巫使用魔法后
I'm told our coven hasn't been
able to celebrate feast days

74
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,158
我们的族人便无法公开庆祝节日
in the open since Marcel
restricted the use of magic.

75
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:31,293
如今和平时代来了
我希望能有所改变
Now with the new peace,
I'd like that to change.

76
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,065
我想你已经决定一个特定的节日了
Am I to assume that you have
a certain feast day in mind?

77
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,903
恩典节
The Fete des Benedictions.

78
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,510
也就是祈福的节日
Feast of the blessings.

79
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,045
在过去，社区里的人们
向女巫们进献礼物
In the past, members of the community
offered witches gifts

80
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,875
以换取她们的祝福
in exchange for blessings.

81
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,313
我们想借这个机会
We'd like to use it as a forum

82
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,248
向公众介绍那些年轻的收获祭女孩
for introducing our young
Harvest girls to society.

83
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,082
你的族人试图破坏我的家庭
So your coven attempted
to destroy my family

84
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,919
而你让我的手足
承受了难以言喻的痛苦
and you yourself held my
siblings in unspeakable torment.

85
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,391
如今你居然请求让女巫开派对
And you would like
a party for the witches.

86
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,890
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
(KLAUS LAUGHS)

87
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,929
我与你弟弟已冰释前嫌
I made my amends with your brother.

88
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,368
你何不好好考虑一下？
Why don't you think it over?

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,775
别这么不近人情，以利亚
Don't be such a stiff, Elijah.

90
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,399
游客们最喜欢热闹的节日了
The tourists love a good festival.

91
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:12,738
再说，还有什么比得上
Besides, what better way
to cement solidarity

92
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,804
向旧时敌人示好更有利于…
制片：兰斯安德森
than a show of faith

93
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:16,041
…巩固我们的结盟呢？
toward a onetime enemy?

94
00:05:16,182 --> 00:05:20,619
一个你已走得过于接近的旧时敌人
A onetime enemy with whom you've
grown rather nauseatingly intimate.

95
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,813
谁说结盟的同时不能找点乐子呢？
Who said maintaining
alliances can't be fun?

96
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:26,254
你不是有些更应该做的事吗
One would think you'd
be a little more interested

97
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:29,225
比如说，关心你孩子的母亲？
in attending to the needs
of the mother of your child.

98
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:34,026
原来如此贴心的整修
都是为了她吧
So she's the reason behind this
oh-so-thoughtful renovation.

99
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,897
事实上，以利亚
我孩子的母亲在狼人中有很高的地位
Elijah, the truth is the mother
of my child is werewolf royalty.

100
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,833
她在河口与族人待在一起
She's far safer in
the bayou with her pack

101
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,666
比在我们身边要安全得多
than she would ever be here with us.

102
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:45,907
别担心，我会在她分娩前把她带回来的
Don't worry. I'll bring her
home before the birth.

103
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,010
我的孩子绝不会…
制片：邦妮怀斯
No child of mine

104
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,310
…在沼泽地里出生
will be born in a swamp.

105
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,010
开什么玩笑
说真的，这是怎么回事？
You've gotta be kidding me.
Seriously, what is going on?

106
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:54,449
这些人是谁？
Who are all these people?

107
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,818
为什么他们都如此怪异地站在那里？
Why are they standing out
here all weird and lurky?

108
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,152
他们来自各地的各个族群
They've come from all over.
All the packs.

109
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,285
为什么？
来看一个还没出生的婴儿吗？
Why? To see a baby
that isn't even born yet?

110
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:05,226
别提婴儿了
Forget the baby.

111
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,424
这些怪胎，他们是来看你的
These freaks,
they came here to see you.

112
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,898
要知道，因为你父母
You know, given
the place your parents

113
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,696
在族群中的地位，他们或许认为
held in pack hierarchy,
maybe they think

114
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:12,361
你就是他们等待多年的
编剧：玛格丽特麦金泰尔
you're gonna be the long-lost

115
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,134
狼人救世主什么的
编剧：麦可鲁梭
werewolf messiah or something.

116
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,140
太好了，还真是一点都没压力
导演：莱斯利里布曼
Great. No pressure or anything.

117
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,672
喂？
Hello?

118
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:24,544
奥利佛，关于我们谈的事
我相信你有进展了吧
Oliver. I trust you have an update
on the matter we discussed.

119
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,482
嗯…关于那件事
Yeah... About that.

120
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,815
如今这里聚集了无数狼人
We got wolves coming in
by the truckload right now,

121
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,117
要在这里面找一个人可不太客易
so it's gonna be a little
tricky to find just one guy.

122
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,816
毕竟你只给了我一个名字
I mean, all you gave me
was a first name.

123
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,621
没错，他叫凯瑞
Yes. His name is Cary.

124
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,821
金色头发、褐色瞳孔
He's got blond hair and brown eyes.

125
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,864
他是我的族人之一
来自东北大西洋族群的
He's one of my clan,
a distant relative

126
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,796
远房亲戚
from the Northeast Atlantic pack.

127
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:45,301
你若想继续我们的计划就得找到他
His presence is required if
we are to continue with our plan.

128
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,463
找到他，把他带来给我
You find him and you bring him to me.

129
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,939
好吧，我尽力
All right, fine. I'm on it.

130
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,067
还有一件事，我哥哥最近会邀请你
Another thing....
my brother will soon invite you

131
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:54,145
参加一场向女巫致敬的聚会
to a feast honoring the witches.

132
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,738
你和你的朋友们要识趣地接受邀请
You and your friends will
graciously accept the invitation.

133
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,079
凭什么啊？
Why the hell would I do that?

134
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,084
因为让以利亚觉得他的协定奏效了
Because if Elijah believes
his treaty is working,

135
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,212
他就不会来找我麻烦了
he'll be less inclined
to get in my way.

136
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,286
（卢梭酒吧）

137
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,023
你来干嘛？
What do you want?

138
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,536
我最近结识了一个友人
或许能帮你叔叔
I formed an alliance with someone
who may be able to help your uncle.

139
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:23,199
我猜是那个
别有用心的红发高个儿女吧
Let me guess.
Tall, redhead, axe to grind?

140
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:24,468
当初就是那些复活的女巫
Those resurrected witches

141
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,907
对基兰下咒的
are the ones who
hexed Kieran in the first place.

142
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,376
她又怎么会帮忙？
Why would she want to help?

143
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,845
因为我要她这么做
Because it's my decree that she does.

144
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,915
我想你至少说句“谢谢”吧
I believe the words you're
looking for are "thank you."

145
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,615
不管怎么说，你也可以拒绝
By all means,
say no if you have an alternative.

146
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
我拒绝
No.

147
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,401
等一下
Wait.

148
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:57,774
尽你所能帮助他
Do whatever you have to do.
Just help him.

149
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,348
你要我盯着克劳斯，我照做了
You wanted me to
keep an eye on Klaus. I did.

150
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,818
要我说，这是一件好事
If you ask me, this is a good thing.

151
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,217
他在讨好和你很要好的女孩
Him fawning all over a girl

152
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,187
这对我们很有利
you've got wrapped around
your finger helps us.

153
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,986
我不能让卡蜜受到伤害
I don't want Cami getting hurt.

154
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,026
女巫已经盯上她了
She's already got witches
spying on her.

155
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,027
你知道要是克劳斯发现我们俩是一伙的
Do you have any idea
what Klaus is gonna do

156
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,688
他会怎么做吗？
when he finds out that we hooked up?

157
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:20,958
不关我的事
Not my problem.

158
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,263
我们要担心的是那混合种在谋划什么
The thing we need to worry about
is what his hybrid ass is up to.

159
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:26,428
他和女巫们结成了一伙
He's got something going
on with the witches,

160
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,540
背着以利亚暗中谋划
and he's doing it
behind Elijah's back.

161
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,165
不管他居心何在，要是让我抓到把柄…
Whatever he's up to,
if I can find proof--

162
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,904
你要怎样？
跟他哥哥告状吗？
You'll what? You're gonna rat
him out to his older brother?

163
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,536
让他们兄弟反目成仇吗？
You're gonna turn them
against each other?

164
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,239
你已经被驱逐出法语区了
You're exiled from the Quarter.

165
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,476
你还没走近，以利亚就会要了你的命
Elijah even smells you
coming and you're dead.

166
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,678
我比你了解他们
You don't know them like I do.

167
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,719
他们已经互有戒心了
They're half turned
against each other already.

168
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:49,385
一千年的家族恩怨
自大、愧疚、嫉妒
A thousand years of family
drama, pride, guilt, envy,

169
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,554
全堆积成了一个炸药桶
all built up like a powder keg.

170
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,222
只需要你去把它点燃
All you have to do is light a match.

171
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,867
怎样才能点燃？
Then where do we buy matches?

172
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,701
醒醒吧，马赛尔，我们一无所有
Look around, Marcel.
We have nothing.

173
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,399
我起初也一无所有
I started with nothing.

174
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,841
直到我转变了你，一切才有起色
Hell, things didn't get
rolling until I turned you.

175
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,819
你和你的音乐，还有属于我们的城市
You and your music
and the whole city for the taking.

176
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,784
那些风光的日子，小提
Those were the days, T.

177
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:17,950
让我们把它夺回来
Let's go get 'em back.

178
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,851
谁让你做主的？
And who put you in charge?

179
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,928
我和祖先们交谈过了
I communed with the ancestors.

180
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,089
他们说是时候该让你做出牺牲了
They said it's time for
you to sacrifice yourself.

181
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,038
当然
Of course.

182
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,801
为我们族人履行我的义务是我的荣幸
It will be an honor
to fulfill my duty to our coven.

183
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,575
但现在时候未到
But it's not quite my time yet.

184
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,146
祖先们很清楚
The ancestors were very clear.

185
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,146
只有你死了，我们的族群才能
We need for you to die
so our community can have

186
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,012
获得收获祭的所有力量
the full power of the Harvest.

187
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,779
注意措辞，莫妮克
Careful, Monique.

188
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,388
不久之前，我也是祖先之一
Not so long ago,
I was one of those ancestors.

189
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,753
我就这样看着女巫一点一点地
A spirit forced to watch
as little by little,

190
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,089
向吸血鬼屈服
witches surrendered
everything to vampires.

191
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,991
我们或许已不受马赛尔控制
We may no longer live
under Marcel's thumb,

192
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,467
但我也不会乖乖服从于以利亚
but I for one don't particularly
enjoy answering to Elijah, either.

193
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,096
在我离开之前，我要确保
Before I take my leave,
I'd like to ensure

194
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,004
你们有能力掌控自己的命运
that you have the power
to control your own fate.

195
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,536
米卡森家的母亲艾丝塔是个强大的女巫
The Mikaelsons' mother,
Esther, was a powerful witch.

196
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,511
她的魔法书里有我们用得上的地方
Her spellbook contains enchantments
that we can use to our own ends.

197
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,620
我可以为我们族人偷来这本书
I can steal it for our coven

198
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,949
这样我们就再也不会受到欺压了
and we'll never be held
in subjugation again.

199
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,387
你们会得到需要的献祭
You'll have your sacrifice.

200
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:32,628
但在我死之前，我还有事要办
But I have things to do before I die.

201
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:39,161
你要我们卑躬屈膝地去参加
女巫的活动，还要献礼？
You want us to go to a witch event
on bended knee and give them a gift?

202
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,466
真抱歉，但我没记错的话
(SCOFFS) I'm sorry,
but I just remembered,

203
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:44,269
那晚我们正好已经有安排了
we're busy doing just about
anything else that night.

204
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,775
迪亚哥，这不是请求
Diego, this isn't a request.

205
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,276
协定上有你的名字
Your name is on that treaty.

206
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,438
如果你对你的新职位
Now, if you have
any difficulty whatsoever

207
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,413
有什么不适应的话
with your newfound position,

208
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,814
我很愿意把你换掉
I'd be more than willing
to remove you.

209
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,083
我还真没想到会有这一天
I never thought I'd see the day.

210
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:01,216
吸血鬼向女巫屈服
Vampires bowing down to witches.

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,590
我视它为一种实力的展现
I see it as a demonstration
of strength.

212
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,856
向弱小致敬
Acknowledging a lesser faction.

213
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,024
但你并不是在请求，对吧？
But you're not asking, are you?

214
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,633
看来他们关于你的言论是真的，以利亚
I see it's true what
they say about you, Elijah.

215
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,903
你会把暴力也伪装得很高尚
You make even
strong-arming seem noble.

216
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,645
不过…
Well....

217
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,541
游客们很吃这一套
The tourists do eat this stuff up.

218
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,017
你能想像当他们突然发现
Can you imagine what they'd think if

219
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,985
这一切都是真的会怎么想吗？
they suddenly found
out it was all real?

220
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:32,747
我想你是要我出席公开表演
I take it you want me
at the public show

221
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,951
和之后的私人聚会是吗？
and the private party afterward?

222
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,584
是的
That is correct.

223
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,287
我很乐意参加
I'd be happy to attend.

224
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,266
这样你就欠人类一个人情了
And in return, you will
owe the humans a favor.

225
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:45,734
你们族人能有如此气魄
Your people are uniquely poised

226
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,339
为法语区的其他族群树立榜样
to set an example for
the rest of the French Quarter.

227
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,443
这也就是为什么狼人参与
此次活动如此重要
Which is why it's important
for the wolves to attend.

228
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,306
心意领了，但我们不去
Thanks but no thanks?

229
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,674
先听他说完
Let's hear the man out.

230
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,749
那些女巫对你们狼群施了咒
The witches are the ones
that cursed your pack.

231
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,316
也是她们，自我一进城
And they've been
nothing but crap to me

232
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,114
就给我找麻烦，不去
since I first came to town. No.

233
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,279
我们不会去
We're not going.

234
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,119
此一时彼一时了，海莉
It's a new day
in the Quarter, Hayley.

235
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,351
我同意奥利佛的想法
I agree with Oliver.

236
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,229
只有相互配合，才能共存
If we're gonna coexist,
we have to play ball.

237
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,492
我们会派代表带着礼物前去
We'll send a representative
with a gift.

238
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,744
这未免太容易了
That was too easy.

239
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,750
不要相信他
Don't trust him.

240
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,752
不要相信他们任何人
Don't trust any of them.

241
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,627
别试图反抗了
You don't stop squirming,

242
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,794
我可不管你认识什么人
再动我就打碎你的膝盖
I don't care who you know,
I'm gonna kneecap you right here.

243
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,100
我是要你把凯瑞当作客人带来给我
When I asked you to bring Cary
to me, it was as my guest.

244
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,799
你最好放开他
Might I recommend you release him

245
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,638
不然我就送你上西天
before I opt to release you
from your mortal coil.

246
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:05,348
我照你的吩咐找到了他
然后他攻击了我
I found him like you
asked and he jumped me.

247
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,418
他的狼群一直在攻击我的狼群
Now, his pack's been going at mine
since the beginning of time.

248
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,679
我可什么都不欠他
I don't owe him a thing.

249
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,755
瞧，就是这样的短见
You see, it's that
shortsighted attitude

250
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,858
导致了狼人的垮台
that led to the demise
of the werewolves.

251
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:15,119
我确定这是马赛尔和女巫造成的
I'm pretty sure Marcel
and the witches did that.

252
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,161
狼群本该团结一心
The packs should have been united.

253
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,764
马赛尔发现了你们的弱点并利用它
Marcel saw that weakness
and he exploited it.

254
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,197
如果你们只想靠新月族重建狼族
If you seek to rebuild
with only the Crescents,

255
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,564
那你们就该待在沼泽的茅舍别出来
you may as well stay
in your hovels in the bog.

256
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:31,669
我想我还没有幸自我介绍一下
I don't believe we've had
the pleasure of an introduction.

257
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,608
传闻你是我族一脉的后裔
Legend says you're
descended from our line.

258
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,509
传闻是真的
The legends are true.

259
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:40,278
凯瑞，我知道这枚戒指是我们家族
Now, Cary, I understand that
this ring was passed down

260
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,046
世世代代传下来的
through generations of our family.

261
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,558
我想知道它放在哪个石头里
I need to know what stone it housed.

262
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:48,387
我从没见过什么石头
I never saw it with a stone.

263
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,052
能帮我打听一下吗，兄弟？
Could you ask around
for me, mate? Hmm?

264
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,529
看看能不能有所发现
See what you can find out.

265
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,533
你无法光靠自己就发动一场革命
DlEGO: You can't just start
a revolution all on your own

266
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,000
结束流放重掌大权
from exile across the river.

267
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,197
我是说，不管你喜不喜欢
以利亚的计划就是新的现实
I mean, like it or not, Elijah's
plan is the new reality.

268
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,308
以利亚要你对女巫卑躬屈膝
Elijah's got you
bowing down to witches.

269
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,570
过不了多就你就要对狼人俯首称臣了
How long until you're
kowtowing to werewolves?

270
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,876
好吧，那谁来领导这次谋反？你吗？
Right. And who's gonna lead
this rebellion? You?

271
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,146
我倒是有些想法
I got a few ideas.

272
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,420
我记得上次与你一起对抗真祖时的情形
I remember the last time I stood
with you against an Original.

273
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,719
过程并不顺利
Didn't go so well.

274
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,261
我们所要做的就是表明我们不会屈服
All we gotta do is show
that we won't bow down.

275
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,988
制造足够的泥乱，他们就会离开
Make enough noise, they'll leave.

276
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,895
我想如果我们团结起来，力量会更大
I figure we can be a lot louder
if we're in it together.

277
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,998
听着，以利亚米卡森无疑是个混蛋
Look, Elijah Mikaelson's
a dick, no doubt.

278
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,138
但和他在一起，我至少清楚自己的立场
Thing is, with him,
at least I know where I stand.

279
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,503
是吗？
Do you?

280
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,577
我们一直在监视克劳斯
We've been watching Klaus.

281
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:44,444
他和女巫做交易
与狼人秘密会面
Making deals with witches, holding
secret meetings with werewolves.

282
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,141
你不能相信这些人
You can't trust these people.

283
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,412
是你捡起了克劳斯的硬币
You're the one who
picked up Klaus's coin.

284
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,785
是你，马赛尔
小提也许记性不好，但我不是
You, Marcel. Maybe T's
got a short memory, but I don't.

285
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,890
你是个懦夫
You're a coward.

286
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,859
我捡起硬币的时候，是在为你们着想
When I picked up that coin,
I was saving your ass.

287
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,767
克劳斯要把你们全部杀掉
Klaus was gonna kill all of you.

288
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:10,040
一个好的领袖知道何时该放手择日再战
A good leader knows when
he's gotta fight another day.

289
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:13,201
现在这一天来了
我准备好了，你要与我并肩作战吗？
Now that day's here.
I'm ready. You gonna fight with me?

290
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,542
用什么战？
看看四周
With what? Look around.

291
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,583
你只有提艾里和一堆空话
All you got is Thierry
and a whole bunch of talk.

292
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,811
你们看来还没认清现实，你已经输了
You guys don't seem to get it.
You lost, all right?

293
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,718
我选择了赢的那一方
如果你想要开战
I picked the winning side,
so if you want to start a war...

294
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,090
你就是我的敌人
...you're fighting against me.

295
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,497
该以行动说话了
Time we got more persuasive.

296
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,969
怎么了？这是高中吗？
What is this?
High School?

297
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,043
你还是接受暗示管好你自己的事吧
Why don't you take the hint
and mind your own business?

298
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,140
这是我的族群
所以这就是我的事
This is my pack.
That makes it my business.

299
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,581
没必要动气，对你不好，海莉
No need to get all riled up.
It's not good for you, Hayley.

300
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,085
我刚刚已经试过好好说了
I have tried to play nice.

301
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,054
怀孕后期荷尔蒙和情绪波动比较大
The last month of pregnancy is
all hormones and mood swings,

302
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,523
除非你希望我把你的胳膊扭断
so unless you want me
to snap your arm like a twig,

303
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,685
不然你最好告诉我发生了什么事
I suggest that you
tell me what is going on.

304
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,490
- 你去死吧
- 别这样
-You can go to hell.
-Knock it off.

305
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,893
没理由瞒着她
There's no reason
to keep it from her.

306
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,499
我倒是有个理由
I can think of a reason.

307
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,125
高大永生，口袋还放手帕的人
Tall and immortal and wears
a pocket scarf.

308
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,501
海莉，你是我们的一员，你应该知道
Hayley, you're one of us.
You deserve to know.

309
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,800
有话好好说
Now, come on..

310
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:26,009
我们缔结了一个联盟
We made an alliance...

311
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,244
这对狼人将是个重大转折
...that's gonna change everything
for the wolves.

312
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,014
与谁结盟？
An alliance with who?

313
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,350
克劳斯
Klaus.

314
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,022
跟我详细说
Tell me everything.

315
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,561
你大老远跑来就是求我救一个人类？
You came all this way to
beg for some human's life?

316
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:42,565
基兰神父就快没时间了
他一直是我的盟友
Father Kieran's time is running out
and he has been an ally to me.

317
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:45,829
你的盟友，也是卡蜜的叔叔
Your ally, and Cami's uncle.

318
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:50,572
抱歉，就像我说过的
这个咒语没办法撤销
Sorry. As I've already said,
there's no way to undo that hex.

319
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,473
得了吧，我们都知道咒语总有漏洞
Oh, come on. You and I both
know there's always a loophole.

320
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,375
这个没有
Not for this.

321
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,072
至少我的族人没找到
At least not among my people.

322
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,877
不过我倒是很好奇
Although I do wonder.

323
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,551
你的母亲很强大
Your mother was powerful.

324
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,088
她会各种形式的咒语
She would have had access
to all manner of spells.

325
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,591
也许我可以看看她的魔法书
Perhaps I could take a look
through her grimoire.

326
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:10,661
你想用基兰神父的病痛当作借口
You want to use
Father Kieran's ailment

327
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,128
趁机翻看我母亲的魔法书
as an excuse to look through
my mother's spellbook.

328
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,459
真狡猾
Very devious.

329
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,728
得了吧，魔法书对你来说根本没用
Come on.
The grimoire is worthless to you.

330
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,237
但借助它的力量
我就能巩固我在族群的地位
But with its power, I could
solidify my place in the coven.

331
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,601
不行，抱歉，亲爱的
No, I'm sorry, love.

332
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:25,733
我母亲的力量被你的祖先神圣化
已经够糟了
It's bad enough my mother's power was
consecrated with your ancestors.

333
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,005
我绝对不会让你看到
The last thing I need is
for you to get a look

334
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,638
她那一整本龌龊的小伎俩
at an entire book
of her dirty, little tricks.

335
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,047
那真是太遗憾了
That's unfortunate.

336
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,085
尤其是对可怜的基兰神父来说
Particularly for poor Father Kieran.

337
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,186
我想还是由你来告诉卡蜜吧
I guess you'll be the one
to tell Cami.

338
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,258
你觉得你能掌控我吗？
You think you have leverage over me?

339
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,421
我不会被操纵的
I will not be manipulated.

340
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,069
我也不会被威胁，所以
And I won't be threatened.
So, between the two of us,

341
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,504
既然我们都清楚自己的立场
we each know where we stand.

342
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,270
只要我们能保持互相尊重
As long as we can retain
that mutual respect,

343
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,902
我看就没必要再展示各自的力量了吧
I don't see a need for any
further demonstrations of power.

344
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,004
别再打给我了
Don't call me again.

345
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,914
是时候了
It's time.

346
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:48,788
克劳斯会出席活动
也就是说宅邸没人
Klaus will be at the event, which
means the compound will be empty.

347
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,485
你知道该怎么做
You know what to do.

348
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:12,978
现在，根据恩典节的程序
Now, in accordance with
the Fete des Benedictions,

349
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,815
纽奥良的女巫们会赐福予你们所有人
the witches of New
Orleans bless you all.

350
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:30,321
有点太容易了，不是吗？
KLAUS: A little too easy, isn't it?

351
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,365
我正在等你
I've been expecting you.

352
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,090
你迟到了
You're late.

353
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,737
黛维娜
Davina.

354
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,613
以利亚
Elijah.

355
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,976
很高兴见到你
It's lovely to see you.

356
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,312
而且状况还蛮不错的
And under far better circumstances.

357
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,886
是吗？
Is it?

358
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,421
我朋友提姆还是死的
而你的弟弟还活着
My friend Tim is still dead and
your brother's still breathing.

359
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,047
黛维娜，够了
Davina, that's enough.

360
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,092
以利亚是今晚活动的赞助人
Elijah has been a patron
to us this evening.

361
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,354
我们应该对他尊重些
We will show him respect.

362
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:09,862
谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you for all of this.

363
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,401
这不是为了你
This isn't for you.

364
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,027
你我都清楚
如果我们不对你的族人表示些尊重
You know as well as I that your
people would never accept a truce

365
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,072
她们永远不会接受休战
unless we showed them some respect.

366
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,301
那就这样吧
So be it.

367
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,012
祝你派对愉快
Enjoy your party.

368
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:34,087
真奇怪，我以为你会
和你那些有趣的朋友在一起呢
Strange. I thought you'd be in the
company of your colorful friends.

369
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,657
你需要一个狼人代表
You asked for a representative
for the werewolves,

370
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,822
所以接不接受随你
so.... take me or leave me.

371
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:53,210
有什么问题吗？
Is something wrong?

372
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,439
这些人是来赞美女巫的
These people came to praise witches.

373
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,209
她做了什么证明了自己的价值？
What's she done
to prove herself worthy?

374
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:02,184
她是个收获祭女孩，和你一样
She's a Harvest girl.
Like you.

375
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,889
我们的力量是祖先的恩赐
Our power is a gift
from the ancestors.

376
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,822
为了这份恩赐我做出了牺牲
I've had to make sacrifices
to honor that gift.

377
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,796
我失去了我的母亲、阿姨
I lost my mother.
My aunt.

378
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,899
黛维娜除了跟我们作对什么都没做
Davina has done nothing
but stand against us.

379
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,831
她只是需要一些教训
She just needs a little lesson.

380
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,530
如果要说我擅长什么的话
那就是让人们安守本分
If there's one thing I'm good at,
it's putting people in their place.

381
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,180
欢迎
Welcome.

382
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:32,283
现在要进行我们历史悠久的传统
As is our time-honored tradition,

383
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,580
很欢迎各位送上你们的祭品
you are all welcome
to deliver your offerings.

384
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,385
我们的传统是任何人都不应被拒绝
It is our custom that no one
should be turned away,

385
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,958
任何祝福都不应被拒绝
no blessing be denied.

386
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,265
你收到礼物了吗？
Do you get any gifts?

387
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:29,603
你来这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

388
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,039
其实我是擅自进来的
但我是来见你的
Technically, I'm crashing,
but it's you I came to see.

389
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:35,010
别担心，我只想说完要说的话
然后我就会离开
Don't worry, I just want to say
my piece and then I'll leave.

390
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:37,046
给你
Here.

391
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:38,983
这是什么？
And what is this?

392
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,085
是我的祭品
An offering, from me.

393
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,743
我知道我们没理由喜欢彼此
I know we have no reason
to like each other,

394
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:45,220
但我想向以利亚建立的一切表示敬意
but I want to honor
what Elijah has built.

395
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,291
我叔叔也曾为此努力过
What my uncle worked for.

396
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,089
原来是为了你叔叔的事
Oh. So this is about your uncle.

397
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,560
如我所说，我知道你没理由帮我
Like I said, I know you have no
reason to help me,

398
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,895
但克劳斯说
很久以前，你被欺骗死去
but Klaus said a long time ago,
you were cheated out of life, and

399
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:02,166
如果我不能帮他，如果你不能帮他
他也帮不了他
if I can't help him, if you can't
help him, so will he.

400
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,243
所以我请求你，求求你
And so I'm asking you.... please.

401
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,608
克劳斯说你来自这个时代
Klaus said you were from this era.

402
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:18,348
- 我想你有头红发…
- 我曾经有一个和这个一样的
-And I thought with your red hair....
-I had one just like this.

403
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:27,662
也许我能帮你
Perhaps I can help you.

404
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,783
小约，你怎么来了？
Josh. What are you doing here?

405
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,285
你开玩笑吗？
我才不会错过你的重要日子
What, are you kidding?
No way I'd miss out on your big day.

406
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,413
再说了，音乐、微风、火焰
Besides, music, wind, fire....

407
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:54,923
内心那个爱玩的我彷佛置身天堂
The club kid in me
is, like, in heaven.

408
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,554
不过你看起来并不开心
You don't look like you're
having much fun, though.

409
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:06,196
来吧，我们离开这里
Come on. Let's get out of here.

410
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,431
约书亚
Joshua.

411
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:11,098
真是太巧了，能在这找到你
What a fortunate coincidence
finding you here.

412
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,438
我们还有事没了结呢
We have unfinished business.

413
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,218
你给我马上离开这里
You need to leave here right now.

414
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,321
平心而论，亲爱的
你已经不像以前那样强大了，不是吗？
To be fair, love, you're not quite as
powerful as you once were, are you?

415
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,252
你没资格下命今
You're in no position to give orders.

416
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,919
- 来吧，小伙子
- 我们能谈一下吗？
-(GROANlNG)
-Come along, lad.
OK, can we talk about this?

417
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:31,323
小约
Josh!

418
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:37,665
各位来宾，请注意
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

419
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:43,570
今天我们齐聚一堂
向我们爱戴的女巫们表示敬意
We are gathered here today to pay
homage to our beloved witches.

420
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,971
但有一位非常特别的女巫
But one very special witch

421
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,944
却完全被忽略了
has been utterly ignored.

422
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,910
在我看来有点不公平
That seems a little unfair to me.

423
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,046
不要
No.

424
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:02,220
我不想要你的礼物
I don't want your gift.

425
00:26:04,663 --> 00:26:08,690
鉴于我们的过往
我了解你为什么拒绝我
I understand why you would
reject me, given our past.

426
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:16,266
事实上，今天在场有许多人
在我哥哥一纸协定所终结的冲突中
In truth, many of us here today
have been wronged in the conflict,

427
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,399
被冤枉了
which my brother's treaty ended.

428
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,979
你的朋友小约曾密谋杀我
Your friend Josh was involved
in a plot to kill me.

429
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,673
此时此刻，我本有权利
It would be well within my right

430
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:28,445
在此处决他
to execute him here and now.

431
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,755
但是，秉着团结一致的精神
But.... in the spirit of solidarity,

432
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:39,955
以及看在你的份上，黛维娜
我在此原谅他
and for your favor, Davina,
I hereby pardon him.

433
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:46,431
小约，从今往后，你再也不用害怕我
Josh.... from this day forward,
you have nothing to fear from me.

434
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,266
请收下
Please.

435
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:15,427
你要打开吗？
So are you gonna open it?

436
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:29,343
怎么了？是什么？
What? What is it?

437
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,642
这是制作日光戒指的咒语
It's the spell
that makes daylight rings.

438
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:43,258
我听说你让狼人们留下了深刻的印象
I hear you made quite an
impression with the wolves.

439
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,621
我与他们的安排本该是个秘密
My arrangement with them
was supposed to be a secret,

440
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:48,392
而你却逼他们说出来
and yet you forced it out of them.

441
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,023
真是大胆
It's very bold.

442
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:54,696
就像你今天决定代表他们独自来出席
As was your decision to represent
them here today, on your own.

443
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,609
我相信你绝不会做出危害我们目标的事
I trust you'll do nothing
to harm our cause.

444
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,177
你真的要背着以利亚吗？
Are you really gonna go
behind Elijah's back?

445
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,904
得了，只要对你的族人有利
Come on, what difference
does it make to you

446
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,310
这对你有何区别？
as long as your people benefit?

447
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:08,977
如果让我发现你在玩什么把戏
试图为了你的某个阴谋
If I find out that you are playing
some game, trying to manipulate us

448
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,384
- 而操纵我们…
- 你真是大有长进啊
-for one of your schemes--
-You know, you've come a long way...

449
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,854
小狼
...Iittle wolf.

450
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,816
我知道你很强悍，也知道你很精明
I knew you were tough,
I knew you were cunning,

451
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,293
但我从不知道你是女王
but I never knew you were a queen.

452
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:47,817
恩典节快乐
Happy Fete des Benedictions.

453
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:52,692
我们有消息要带给你们
We have a message
for all of you,

454
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,322
是马赛尔杰拉德的
from Marcel Gerard.

455
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,112
控制好自己
Control yourselves.

456
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,810
这是个下流的诡计
This is a vulgar trick.

457
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,083
我们不能违反协定
We do not violate our agreement.

458
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,056
海莉
Hayley!

459
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,533
带她们离开这里
Get them out of here!

460
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,335
- 以利亚？
- 海莉
-Elijah?
-Hayley.

461
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:44,073
没事
没事了
It's OK.
It's all right.

462
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,030
（永无宁日）

463
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,765
墙上的血迹、一堆尸体
THlERRY: Blood on the walls.
Pile of bodies.

464
00:30:07,902 --> 00:30:09,597
总而尝之，消息大家都收到了
All in all, I'd say message received.

465
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:10,999
有没有先把黛维娜带出去？
Did you get Davina out first?

466
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:13,107
正如计划的一样，小约照顾黛维娜
As planned, Josh took care of Davina.

467
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,573
我确保其他收获祭女孩安全离开
I made sure the other Harvest
girls got out in the clear.

468
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,678
那只是个警告
That was just a warning shot.

469
00:30:17,812 --> 00:30:19,143
现在我们要加倍了
Now we double down.

470
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,645
马赛尔！
-ELlJAH: Marcel!
-(THlERRY GRUNTlNG)

471
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:26,910
我警告过你了
I warned you.

472
00:30:28,789 --> 00:30:30,848
但你还是回到了法语区
And yet still you return
to the French Quarter.

473
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,620
你要杀了我吗，以利亚？动手吧
You gonna kill me, Elijah? Go ahead.

474
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:36,025
但你就没法知道克劳斯和他的女巫
But then you won't know
what Klaus has got going

475
00:30:36,164 --> 00:30:37,654
有何打算了
with that witch in his pocket.

476
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:40,733
我究竟该怎么做呢？
我想我可以直接问他
Whatever shall I do?
I suppose I could just ask him.

477
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:43,268
是啊，一定要让他告诉你
Yeah. Make sure
he tells you all about

478
00:30:43,404 --> 00:30:45,872
他和狼人的那些秘密会面
the secret meetings
with the werewolves.

479
00:30:46,007 --> 00:30:48,601
就是说，一旦他知道你杀了我
That is, if he's
still speaking to you

480
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:50,301
他还会告诉你吗？
once he knows that you killed me.

481
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:52,139
难道你不了解我吗？
Do you not know me?

482
00:31:02,023 --> 00:31:03,547
你不听话的下场
For your violation.

483
00:31:08,696 --> 00:31:10,857
不，不，不
No. No, no.

484
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:15,367
不
No.

485
00:31:18,072 --> 00:31:23,100
你生，或死，都由我决定
You live.... or you die
according to my will.

486
00:31:25,246 --> 00:31:26,736
努力记住吧
Try to remember that.

487
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:40,623
你没有拿我的祭品就离开了
You left without my offering.

488
00:31:41,696 --> 00:31:43,596
你的吸血鬼毁了我的派对
Your vampires ruined my party.

489
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:46,825
他们不再是我的吸血鬼了，亲爱的
They're not my
vampires anymore, love.

490
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:50,335
尽管马赛尔显然是效仿了
我擅长的戏剧效果
Although Marcel certainly took a page
out of my book of dramatic effect.

491
00:31:51,772 --> 00:31:55,833
听着，我欠黛维娜一些安慰
因为我杀了她的初恋
Look, I owed Davina some consolation
because I killed her first love.

492
00:31:58,045 --> 00:32:00,445
我真的想弥补我做过的坏事
I do try to make up
for my wrongdoings.

493
00:32:00,581 --> 00:32:02,811
至于我们先前的小小争执
As with our little quarrel earlier.

494
00:32:04,252 --> 00:32:06,550
来，给你
So. Here.

495
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:09,452
我今晚早些时候选的
I picked it out earlier tonight.

496
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,922
你的一位朋友帮了我一下
A friend of yours gave me a hand.

497
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:14,155
哪位朋友？
And what friend was that?

498
00:32:14,295 --> 00:32:15,922
打开吧，自己看
Well, open it.
See for yourself.

499
00:32:21,102 --> 00:32:25,630
你真以为我会让我母亲的魔法书
就那样不受保护吗？
Did you really think I would leave
my mother's grimoire unprotected?

500
00:32:31,812 --> 00:32:38,012
一个世纪前，我曾梦想着
认识你会是怎样
A century ago, I dreamed of what
it would be like to know you.

501
00:32:39,587 --> 00:32:40,884
现在我很庆幸我之前不认识你
Now I'm glad I didn't.

502
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:44,116
我也许太天真才会爱上你，或害怕你
I might have been naive enough
to fall for you, or fear you,

503
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:47,921
但我从死亡中学到了很多
相信我，克劳斯米卡森
but I learned a lot in death
and trust me, Klaus Mikaelson,

504
00:32:48,062 --> 00:32:50,394
你才应该害怕我
it's you who should be afraid of me.

505
00:32:54,368 --> 00:32:56,598
真可惜，我会怀念和你上床的
Pity. I will miss the sex.

506
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:00,835
你的朋友卡蜜今晚来过
Your friend Cami showed up tonight.

507
00:33:02,143 --> 00:33:04,737
她的祭品真的很不错
Her offering was quite sweet.

508
00:33:05,413 --> 00:33:08,473
所以我给了她希望
说我会解除基兰的诅咒
So I gave her hope
that I would lift Kieran's hex,

509
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:09,844
但根本就没希望
but there is no hope.

510
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:13,587
或者曾经有，但现在没了
Or if there was, there isn't now.

511
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:16,419
如果神父死了，相信我
If the priest dies, then believe me,

512
00:33:16,557 --> 00:33:18,252
你会迅速随他而去的
you will follow swiftly after him.

513
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:23,257
如果你要杀了我，一个潜在的盟友
It would be foolish of
you to kill me,

514
00:33:23,397 --> 00:33:25,627
只为了一个软弱无力的人类
a potential ally,

515
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:28,860
那你真是太傻了
而她，顺便一提
in defense of some powerless
human who is, by the way,

516
00:33:29,003 --> 00:33:31,904
还和你的敌人马赛尔上床了
sleeping with your enemy.... Marcel.

517
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:38,635
我学到教训了
I've learned my lesson.

518
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,246
一开始我反对你的计划
At first I was against your plan.

519
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:43,214
我以为我们能在以利亚的协定下生存
I thought that we should just
live with Elijah's treaty,

520
00:33:43,351 --> 00:33:46,843
但在这派对之后，那些无辜的人
but after that party,
those innocent people.

521
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:48,955
绝不会有和平
There will never be a peace.

522
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,288
弱者永远只能任凭强者宰割
The weak will always be at the mercy
of whoever is calling the shots.

523
00:33:53,427 --> 00:33:54,985
适者生存
It's survival of the fittest.

524
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:57,120
我们得保护自己
We need to protect ourselves.

525
00:33:57,998 --> 00:34:02,367
我们必须保护彼此
And we.... we need
to protect each other.

526
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:11,607
趁克劳斯还愿意提供帮助
我们要加以利用
We need to use Klaus's help
while he's still willing to give it.

527
00:34:11,746 --> 00:34:13,611
但杰克森
But Jackson....

528
00:34:13,748 --> 00:34:16,911
从今往后，你不能对我有所隐瞒
From now on, you
have to tell me everything.

529
00:34:17,785 --> 00:34:22,518
并且不管怎样
我们都不能相信克劳斯
And no matter what....
we do not trust Klaus.

530
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:34,528
看来你已经为小狼报仇了
Well, I see that you've already
avenged the little wolf.

531
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:40,563
但看你的表情，你还要继续杀人
But judging by your look,
you're still out for blood.

532
00:34:40,708 --> 00:34:44,007
如果疯狂的定义就是反覆做同样的事情
If the definition of insanity is
doing the same thing repeatedly

533
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,373
还期待着不同的结局
and expecting different results,

534
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:47,811
那么无疑我对你的救赎的追求
then surely my quest
for your salvation

535
00:34:47,948 --> 00:34:50,246
已让我成了最疯狂的人之一
ranks me as one
of the maddest of men.

536
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:56,312
说吧
这个私生子这次又干了什么可怕的事？
Come on, then. What horrible deed
has the bastard done this time?

537
00:34:56,457 --> 00:34:59,483
你知道在过去，我确实很欣赏
Do you know, in the past,
I actually appreciated

538
00:34:59,627 --> 00:35:01,652
你操纵一切的手段
the methods to your manipulations.

539
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:04,924
然而，我们现在
处在一个新时代的边缘
However, now here we are,
poised on the brink of a new era

540
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:07,124
不仅有利于你的家，还有利于你的孩子
which will benefit not only
your home but your child,

541
00:35:07,268 --> 00:35:10,465
而你却背着我跟狼人勾结
and you go behind my back
to conspire with wolves.

542
00:35:10,604 --> 00:35:13,471
家庭会议用不上勾结这个词吧
Conspire is hardly the word
I would use for a family council.

543
00:35:13,607 --> 00:35:15,472
你不要忘了，以利亚，他们是我的家人
Lest you forget, Elijah,
they are my family

544
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:16,735
和任何米卡森家的人一样
as much as any Mikaelson,

545
00:35:16,877 --> 00:35:19,937
而这名字，实际上，都不能算是我的姓
a name, in truth,
I cannot even call my own.

546
00:35:21,482 --> 00:35:24,815
你怎么能随意就否认了
你姓了一千年的姓
How casually you disavow 1,000
years of allegiance towards you.

547
00:35:24,952 --> 00:35:26,476
既然我找到了我的其他家人
And now that I've found the remnants

548
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,645
我难道要无视他们的困境吗？
of my other family,
am I to ignore their plight?

549
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:30,984
我本以为你会支持我
想要帮助他们的愿望
I would've thought you'd
support my desire to help them,

550
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:33,491
这样做，我也算帮了海莉和孩子
when in doing so,
I help Hayley, and the child.

551
00:35:33,627 --> 00:35:35,993
不要质疑我对孩子的真心
Do not question my allegiance
towards that child.

552
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,791
那我想你对海莉的感情
Oh, and I suppose
your affection for Hayley

553
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:40,025
和你不知疲倦的奉献毫无关系
has nothing to do with
your tireless dedication.

554
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,568
是的，我今晚看到你对她的关心
Yes, you see, I saw how
you cared for her tonight.

555
00:35:43,704 --> 00:35:45,763
黑暗中呼唤着她的名字
Called her name in the dark.

556
00:35:45,906 --> 00:35:49,137
特别热衷杀死所有会伤害她的人
The zeal with which you destroy
those who would harm her.

557
00:35:52,179 --> 00:35:56,240
我克制住每一次对那个女人的冲动
I have denied every single impulse
I have ever had for that woman.

558
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:57,816
是出于对你的尊敬
Out of some misbegotten respect

559
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,113
而你根本不在乎
for intentions that
you don't even have.

560
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:03,187
- 我警告你…
- 我警告你
-I'm warning you--
-I'm warning you.

561
00:36:03,324 --> 00:36:05,656
我原谅了你，我站在你这边
I've forgiven you.
I have stood by you.

562
00:36:05,793 --> 00:36:07,761
我抛弃了一切欲望
I've forsaken every single
one of my desires

563
00:36:07,895 --> 00:36:10,796
只为了你的可笑的救赎
in the name of your
ridiculous redemption.

564
00:36:10,931 --> 00:36:14,196
再也不会了
如果我想要什么
No more.
If I want something...

565
00:36:15,836 --> 00:36:18,031
我就会得到它
...I'll take it.

566
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:23,769
没有什么，什么都不会阻碍我
And nothing.... nothing....
will stand in my way.

567
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:47,792
- 克劳斯，你…
- 我是来道歉的
-Klaus, what are you--
-I came here to apologize.

568
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:51,237
我犯了一个严重的错误
I've made a terrible mistake.

569
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,170
不管是什么，你该睡一觉把它忘记
Whatever it is,
you should sleep it off.

570
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:55,036
我确定可以等到明天早上再说
I'm sure it can wait till morning.

571
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,778
你去找了洁妮薇
You went to Genevieve.

572
00:36:58,913 --> 00:37:00,710
她被你的恳求打动了
She was moved by your plea.

573
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,213
她甚至可能治好基兰
She may even have cured Kieran.

574
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:04,613
但我侮辱了她
But I insulted her.

575
00:37:06,153 --> 00:37:10,590
作为报复的一种手段
她拒绝帮助他
And as a means of revenge,
she is refusing him aid.

576
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:15,562
基兰会因我而死
Kieran will die because of me.

577
00:37:17,164 --> 00:37:20,156
而且会死得很惨
And it will be a horrible death.

578
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,599
你为什么要告诉我？
Why are you telling me this?

579
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:29,175
因为我相信秘密就是毒药
Because I believe that
secrets are a poison.

580
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,210
需要吐出来
They need to be spat out.

581
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,541
就像你的秘密
Like your secret...

582
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:37,344
你和马赛尔在一起的秘密
...about your time with Marcel.

583
00:37:43,958 --> 00:37:46,017
这不正是你想要的吗？
Isn't that what you wanted?

584
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:49,218
你魅惑我与马赛尔约会
You compelled me
to go out with Marcel.

585
00:37:49,363 --> 00:37:50,796
你让我做你的间谋
You made me your spy.

586
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:52,922
也许我们在一起是你的错
And maybe it's your fault
we got together,

587
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,399
你生气是因为你没能控制住
and you're just mad because
you didn't get to control it.

588
00:37:57,871 --> 00:38:01,637
你告诉马赛尔，如果再让我见到他
You tell Marcel if I see him again...

589
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,468
我会杀了他
...I'll kill him.

590
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:29,064
你不用一直来
You don't need to keep coming out.

591
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,206
如果出问题，我会告诉你的
I'd tell you if something was wrong.

592
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:37,436
她现在很好
But she's doing ok.

593
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,581
这女孩有着领导的天赋
The girl has a natural gift
for leading.

594
00:38:42,716 --> 00:38:44,650
她让所有人都很惊讶
She surprised everyone.

595
00:38:46,387 --> 00:38:47,718
不是所有人
Not everyone.

596
00:38:59,366 --> 00:39:01,857
你想加入我们吗？
Do you want to.... join us?

597
00:39:05,105 --> 00:39:06,470
我想要的…
What I want...

598
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,410
只是那女孩能快乐
...is for that girl to be happy.

599
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:16,874
别告诉她我来过
Don't tell her I was here.

600
00:39:22,322 --> 00:39:24,347
这是提艾里范舒
MARCEL" This is Thierry Vanchure,

601
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:26,083
出色的小号手
mean-ass horn player,

602
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:28,820
勇敢女人的恋人
Iover of feisty women,

603
00:39:28,962 --> 00:39:31,089
女巫、吸血鬼，还有人类
witch, vampire, and human alike.

604
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:41,534
我和他一起重建了这座城市
他一直支持着我
I rebuilt this city with him
and he always had my back.

605
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:44,143
即使我搞砸了，忘记了
Even when I screwed up
and forgot to have his.

606
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,273
而现在…
And now...

607
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,142
我只能向你保证，小提
...all I can do
is promise you this, T.

608
00:39:53,187 --> 00:39:54,916
我不会让你白白牺牲
I won't let you die in vain.

609
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:59,017
我会夺回我们的城市
I will take back our city.

610
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:02,322
即使我得先将它烧成灰烬
Even if I have to burn it down first.

611
00:40:07,367 --> 00:40:09,335
要继续对抗真祖吗？
Going up against The Originals?

612
00:40:11,905 --> 00:40:13,532
真的，绝不放弃吗？
For real, no backing down?

613
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:15,232
绝不放弃
No backing down.

614
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:43,662
你让我们失望了
You failed us.

615
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:45,601
我说过，这需要时间
I told you. It will take time.

616
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,969
你觉得祖先会在乎你的借口吗？
Do you think the ancestors
care about your excuses?

617
00:40:48,108 --> 00:40:50,668
吸血鬼攻击了我们
我们没有获得全部力量前
The vampires attacked us.
We can't retaliate

618
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,836
根本无法报复
until we possess our full strength.

619
00:40:53,947 --> 00:40:56,074
你的献祭是最后一步
Your sacrifice is the final step.

620
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,567
他们说什么？
-What are they saying?
-(PANTlNG)

621
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,935
他们说让你活着
They told me to let you live.

622
00:41:26,947 --> 00:41:29,040
但他们想要其他祭品作为交换
But in exchange,
they want another offering.

623
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:32,647
他们选中的人
One of their choosing.

624
00:41:32,786 --> 00:41:35,687
告诉我，不管他们想要什么
我都会保证献给他们
Tell me. Whatever it is they want,
I will make sure they get it.

625
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:36,949
我发誓
I swear it.

626
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,580
是那个孩子
It's the child.

627
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:43,426
他们要我们杀了克劳斯的孩子
They want us to kill Klaus's child.

628
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:52,366
