This town was my home once.
I want it back.

The city grew accustomed
to having a King.

I'm gonna find a way
to take back our city.

vampires from the sun,

12
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:30,705
so why not a moonlight ring to
protect werewolves from the curse?

13
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,406
You made a deal with Klaus Mikaelson?

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,032
We could finally control what we are.

15
00:00:35,033 --> 00:00:37,611
The humans who hunt us,
the witches who curse us,

16
00:00:37,612 --> 00:00:39,282
the vampires who hate us,

17
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:42,789
we wouldn't just be their equals.
We'd be their superiors.

I'm almost finished.

23
00:01:06,848 --> 00:01:10,526
In my last life, I was far too
modest if I was in the nude.

24
00:01:10,527 --> 00:01:12,632
Well, then consider
yourself much improved.

25
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:15,301
Modesty is for the weak.

26

Well, are you gonna show me?

27
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:27,521
The painting is a gift.

28
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:32,050
A token to honor our pact.

We had such a lovely night

31
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,886
and now I see it was
all a means to an end.

32
00:01:37,887 --> 00:01:42,449
A rather delicious means to
a mutually beneficial end.

Tell me.
Beyond the pleasures of last night

sure is an exquisite painting,

a french quarter witch gain

00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:54,641
Well, the treaty my
dear brother negotiated

38

between the warring
factions of this city,

39
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,577
the one that you yourself signed.

What you and your witches need is
the protection only I can provide.

No one... not vampires,
not werewolves,

not even my brother will dare trifle
with you if I am on your side.

46

And in exchange...
I am to offer you what, exactly?

00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:33,442
All I ask is for
the promise of your allegiance.

To do that, the fourth harvest

Careful, Elijah.

Elijah, the truth is the mother
of my child is werewolf royalty.

Look around, Marcel.
We have nothing.

174
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:01,624
I started with nothing.

175
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:06,129
Hell, things didn't get
rolling until I turned you.

176
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:11,984
You and your music and the
whole city for the taking.

177
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:14,655
Those were the days, T.

178
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,264
Let's go get them back.

179
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,307
And who put you in charge?

180
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:22,360
I communed with the ancestors.

181
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,398
They said it's time for
you to sacrifice yourself.

182
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:35,033
Of course. It will be an honor
to fulfill my duty to our coven.

183
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:39,075
But it's not quite my time yet.

184
00:09:39,076 --> 00:09:40,513
The ancestors were very clear.

185
00:09:40,514 --> 00:09:42,616
We need for you to die so
our community can have

186
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,456
the full power of the harvest.

187
00:09:44,457 --> 00:09:46,291
Careful, Monique.

188
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,918
Not so long ago,
I was one of those ancestors.

189
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:51,129
A spirit forced to watch
as little by little,

190
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,344
witches surrendered
everything to vampires.

191
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:59,406
We may no longer live
under Marcel's thumb,

192
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,975
but I for one don't particularly
enjoy answering to Elijah, either.

193
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:06,561
Before I take my leave,
I'd like to ensure

194
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:09,916
that you have the power
to control your own fate.

195
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,820
The Mikaelsons' mother
Esther was a powerful witch.

196
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:17,993
Her spellbook contains enchantments
that we can use to our own ends.

197
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:19,964
I can steal it for our coven

198
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,163
and we'll never be held
in subjugation again.

199
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:25,704
You'll have your sacrifice...

200
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,961
But I have things to do before I die.

201
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:38,075
You want us to go to a witch event

202
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:39,516
on bended knee and give them a gift?

203
00:10:40,915 --> 00:10:42,686
I'm sorry, but I just remembered.

204
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,433
We're busy doing just about
anything else that night.

205
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:46,923
Diego, this isn't a request.

206
00:10:46,924 --> 00:10:48,424
Your name is on that treaty.

207
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:50,625
Now, if you have
any difficulty whatsoever

208
00:10:50,626 --> 00:10:54,904
with your newfound position, I'd be
more than willing to remove you.

209
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:00,172
I never thought I'd see the day.

210
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,340
Vampires bowing down to witches.

211
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:04,775
I see it as a demonstration
of strength...

212
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,080
Acknowledging a lesser faction.

213
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:10,003
But you're not asking, are you?

214
00:11:13,488 --> 00:11:16,825
I see it's true what
they say about you, Elijah.

215
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:19,993
You make even
strong-arming seem noble.

216
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:27,503
Well...
The tourists do eat this stuff up.

217
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:28,872
Can you imagine what they'd think if

218
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:31,773
they suddenly found
out it was all real?

219
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,972
I take it you want me
at the public show

220
00:11:33,973 --> 00:11:36,192
and the private party afterward?

221
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:37,677
That is correct.

222
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:39,345
I'd be happy to attend.

223
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,184
And in return, you will
owe the humans a favor.

224
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,921
Your people are uniquely poised

225
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:49,425
to set an example for
the rest of the french quarter.

226
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:52,529
Elijah: Which is why it's important
for the wolves to attend.

227
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,544
Thanks but no thanks?

228
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,796
Let's hear the man out.

229
00:11:55,797 --> 00:11:58,899
The witches are the ones
that cursed your pack.

230
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,368
And they've been
nothing but crap to me

231
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,402
since I first came to town. No.

232
00:12:04,105 --> 00:12:05,224
We're not going.

233
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,039
It's a new day in the quarter, Hayley.

234
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,336
I agree with Oliver.

235
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:13,408
If we're gonna coexist,
we have to play ball.

236
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,486
We'll send a representative
with a gift.

237
00:12:30,394 --> 00:12:31,794
That was too easy.

238
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,698
Don't trust him.

239
00:12:36,268 --> 00:12:37,702
Don't trust any of them.

240
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,893
Oliver: You don't stop squirming,

241
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,644
I don't care who you know, I'm
gonna kneecap you right here.

242
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:56,263
When I asked you to bring Cary
to me, it was as my guest.

243
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,024
Might I recommend you release him

244
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:00,613
before I opt to release you
from your mortal coil.

245
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:06,345
I found him like you
asked and he jumped me.

246
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,412
Now, his pack's been going at mine

247
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,744
since the beginning of time
I don't owe him a thing.

248
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,820
You see, it's that shortsighted attitude

249
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,957
that led to the demise
of the werewolves.

250
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,087
I'm pretty sure Marcel
and the witches did that.

251
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,378
The packs should have been united.

252
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,838
Marcel saw that weakness
and he exploited it.

253
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,141
If you seek to rebuild
with only the crescents,

254
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,513
you may as well stay
in your hovels in the bog.

255
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,783
I don't believe we've had
the pleasure of an introduction.

256
00:13:32,784 --> 00:13:34,720
Legele says you're
descended from our line.

257
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,604
The legends are true.

258
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:41,131
Come here. I understand that
this ring was passed down

259
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:42,997
through generations of our family.

260
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:47,699
I need to know what stone it housed.

261
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,534
I never saw it with a stone.

262
00:13:49,535 --> 00:13:52,161
Could you ask around
for me, mate? Hmm?

263
00:13:52,162 --> 00:13:54,479
See what you can find out.

264
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,482
Diego: You can't just start
a revolution all on your own

265
00:13:57,483 --> 00:13:59,085
from exile across the river.

266
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:02,257
I mean, like it or not, Elijah's
plan is the new reality.

267
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,391
Elijah's got you
bowing down to witches.

268
00:14:04,392 --> 00:14:07,695
How long until you're
kowtowing to werewolves?

269
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:11,902
Right. And who's gonna lead
this rebellion, huh? You?

270
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:15,005
I got a few ideas.

271
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:21,484
I remember the last time I stood
with you against an original.

272
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,859
Didn't go so well.

273
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,290
All we gotta do is show
that we won't bow down.

274
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,157
Make enough noise, they'll leave.

275
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,830
I figure we can be a lot louder
if we're in it together.

276
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:34,769
Look, Elijah Mikaelson's
a dick, no doubt.

277
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,138
Thing is, with him at
least I know where I stand.

278
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:38,503
Marcel: Do you?

279
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,505
We've been watching Klaus.

280
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,506
Making deals with witches, holding
secret meetings with werewolves.

281
00:14:45,507 --> 00:14:47,383
You can't trust these people.

282
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,469
You're the one who
picked up Klaus' coin.

283
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,508
You, Marcel.

284
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:52,909
Maybe T's got a short you're
the one who memory, but I don't.

285
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:55,895
You're a coward.

286
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:59,612
Thierry: Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

287
00:15:03,348 --> 00:15:06,049
When I picked up that coin,
I was saving your ass.

288
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,698
Klaus was gonna kill all of you.

289
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:11,217
A good leader knows when he's
gotta fight another day.

290
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:12,449
Now that day's here.

291
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,385
I'm ready. You gonna fight with me?

292
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:17,588
With what? Huh?
Look around.

293
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:20,626
All you got is Thierry
and a whole bunch of talk.

294
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:22,896
You guys don't seem to get it.
You lost, all right?

295
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:25,627
I picked the winning side, so
if you want to start a war...

296
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,162
You're fighting against me.

297
00:15:34,863 --> 00:15:36,976
Time we got more persuasive.

298
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,810
[Door creaks]

299
00:15:43,046 --> 00:15:44,981
What is this?
High School?

300
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:47,150
Why don't you take the hint
and mind your own business?

301
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,489
This is my pack.

302
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,118
That makes it my business.

303
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,560
Jackson: No need to get all riled up.

304
00:15:54,561 --> 00:15:55,595
It's not good for you, Hayley.

305
00:15:55,596 --> 00:15:57,230
I have tried no need to get
to play nice.

306
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,289
The last month of pregnancy is
all hormones and mood swings,

307
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,497
so unless you want me to
snap your arm like a twig,

308
00:16:02,498 --> 00:16:04,898
I suggest that you
tell me what is going on.

309
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:06,467
Oliver: You can go to hell.
Jackson: Knock it off.

310
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:07,969
There's no reason to keep it from her.

311
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:09,438
I can think of a reason.

312
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:12,010
Tall and immortal and wears
a pocket scarf. Uhh!

313
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:15,447
Hayley, you're one of us.
You deserve to know.

314
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:16,681
Go on.

315
00:16:24,989 --> 00:16:29,293
We made an alliance... That's gonna
change everything for the wolves.

316
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:31,237
An alliance with who?

317
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,237
Klaus.

318
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,132
Tell me everything.

319
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,672
You came all this way to
beg for some human's life?

320
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:43,809
Father Kieran's time is running out
and he has been an ally to me.

321
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,978
Your ally, and Cami's uncle.

322
00:16:48,214 --> 00:16:51,782
Sorry. As I've already said,
there's no way to undo that hex.

323
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:54,585
Oh, come on. You and I both
know there's always a loophole.

324
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:56,522
Not for this.

325
00:16:56,523 --> 00:16:58,059
At least not among my people.

326
00:16:58,155 --> 00:16:59,994
Although I do wonder.

327
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,764
Your mother was powerful.

328
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,314
She would have had access
to all manner of spells.

329
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:07,944
Perhaps I could take a look

330
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,772
through her grimoire.

331
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:11,875
You want to use
father Kieran's ailment

332
00:17:11,876 --> 00:17:14,209
as an excuse to look through
my mother's spellbook.

333
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,508
Very devious.

334
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,828
Come on.
The grimoire is worthless to you.

335
00:17:18,978 --> 00:17:22,451
But with its power, I could
solidify my place in the coven.

336
00:17:22,452 --> 00:17:23,753
No, I'm sorry, love.

337
00:17:23,754 --> 00:17:26,959
It's bad enough my mother's power was
consecrated with your ancestors.

338
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,622
The last thing I need is for you to

339
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:31,839
get a look at an entire book
of her dirty, little tricks.

340
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,064
That's unfortunate.

341
00:17:34,065 --> 00:17:36,098
Particularly for poor father Kieran.

342
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,100
I guess you'll be
the one to tell Cami.

343
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,443
You think you have leverage over me?

344
00:17:44,444 --> 00:17:47,380
I will not be manipulated.

345
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,382

[Groaning]

347
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:56,086
And I won't be threatened.
So, between the two of us,

348
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,621
we each know where we stand.

349
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,326
As long as we can retain
that mutual respect,

350
00:18:00,327 --> 00:18:02,957
I don't see a need for any
further demonstrations of power.

351
00:18:03,464 --> 00:18:05,001
Don't call me again.

00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:48,237
It's time.

354
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:52,073
Klaus will be at the event, which
means the compound will be empty.

355
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,508
You know what to do.

356
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,271
Now, in accordance with
the fete des benedictions,

357
00:19:16,272 --> 00:19:19,992
the witches of New
Orleans bless you all.

Klaus: A little too easy, isn't it?

360
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:37,486
I've been expecting you.

361
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:40,403
You're late.

[Music playing]

363
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,977
Davina.

364
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:52,957
Elijah.

365
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,218
It's lovely to see you.

366
00:20:55,392 --> 00:20:57,587
And under far better circumstances.

367
00:20:57,588 --> 00:20:59,055
Is it?

368
00:20:59,056 --> 00:21:01,727
My friend Tim is still dead and
your brother's still breathing.

369
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,231
Davina, that's enough.

370
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:05,386
Elijah has been a patron
to us this evening.

371
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:07,558
We will show him respect.

372
00:21:11,574 --> 00:21:13,009
Thank you for all of this.

373
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,687
This isn't for you.

374
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,214
You know as well as I that your
people would never accept a truce

375
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:19,451
unless we showed them some respect.

376
00:21:19,452 --> 00:21:20,751
So be it.

377
00:21:23,378 --> 00:21:25,159
Enjoy your party.

378
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:37,496
Strange. I thought you'd be in the
company of your colorful friends.

379
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,796
Oh. You asked for a representative
for the werewolves,

380
00:21:40,797 --> 00:21:44,099
so... take me or leave me.

381
00:21:54,817 --> 00:21:56,019
Is something wrong?

382
00:21:57,662 --> 00:22:00,459
These people came to praise witches.

383
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,561
What has she done
to prove herself worthy?

384
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:05,162
She's a harvest girl.
Like you.

385
00:22:06,834 --> 00:22:09,305
Our power is a gift
from the ancestors.

386
00:22:09,306 --> 00:22:11,905
I've had to make sacrifices
to honor that gift.

387
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:16,165
I lost my mother.
My aunt.

388
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:18,128
Davina has done nothing
but stand against us.

389
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:21,212
She just needs a little lesson.

390
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:24,718
If there's one thing I'm good at,
it's putting people in their place.

[Clinking]

392
00:22:30,487 --> 00:22:35,732
Welcome. As is our
time-honored tradition,

393
00:22:35,733 --> 00:22:38,970
you are all welcome to
deliver your offerings.

394
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:42,879
It is our custom that no one
should be turned away,

395
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,181
no blessing be denied.

396
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,799
Cami: Do you get any gifts?

397
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:32,604
What are you doing here?

398
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:35,369
Technically, I'm crashing,
but it's you I came to see.

399
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,167
Don't worry, I just want to say
my piece and then I'll leave.

400
00:23:38,979 --> 00:23:40,210
Here.

401
00:23:40,781 --> 00:23:42,293
And what is this?

402
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:44,413
An offering, from me.

403
00:23:44,414 --> 00:23:46,172
I know we have no reason
to like each other,

404
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,591
but I want to honor
what Elijah has built.

405
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:50,676
What my uncle worked for.

406
00:23:50,677 --> 00:23:53,429
Oh. So this is about your uncle.

407
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,395
Like I said, I know you have no
reason to help me, but Klaus said

408
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,167
a long time ago,
you were cheated out of life, and

409
00:24:00,168 --> 00:24:05,507
if I can't help him, if you can't
help him, neither will he.

410
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:09,406
And so I'm asking you... please.

411
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,036
Klaus said you were from this era.

412
00:24:17,037 --> 00:24:21,525
And I thought with your red hair...
I had one just like this.

413
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:30,170
Perhaps I can help you.

414

[Music playing]

415
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,194
Josh. What are you doing here?

416
00:24:50,195 --> 00:24:51,530
What, are you kidding?

417
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,163
No way I'd miss out on your big day.

418
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:55,741
Besides, music, wind, fire...

419
00:24:55,742 --> 00:24:58,122
The club kid in me
is, like, in heaven.

420
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:03,752
You don't look like you're
having much fun, though.

421
00:25:05,781 --> 00:25:09,630
Hey. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

422
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,354

423
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:14,304
What a fortunate coincidence
finding you here.

424
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:17,593
We have unfinished business.

425
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:26,468
You need to leave here.
Right now.

426
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:27,770
Now, to be fair, you're not

427
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,572
quite as powerful as
you once were, are you?

428
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,339
You're in no position to give orders.

429
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:34,609
Come along, lad.

430
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,942

Klaus: Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

We are gathered here today to pay
homage to our beloved witches,

434
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,054
but one very special witch
has been utterly ignored.

435
00:25:57,894 --> 00:26:00,017

a little unfair to me.

No.

I don't want your gift.

438
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,843
I understand why you would
reject me, given our past

439
00:26:16,812 --> 00:26:22,453
in truth, many of us here today
have been wronged in the conflict

440
00:26:22,454 --> 00:26:24,618
which my brother's treaty ended.

441
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,088
Your friend Josh was involved
in a plot to kill me.

442
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:34,088
It would be well within my right
to execute him here and now.

443
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:41,971
But. In the spirit of solidarity,

444
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:46,063
and for your favor, Davina,
I hereby pardon him.

have nothing to fear from me.

What? What is it?

It's the spell that
makes daylight rings.

I hear you made quite an
impression with the wolves.

My arrangement with them was
supposed to be a secret,

453
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,511
and yet you forced it out of them.

454
00:27:54,512 --> 00:27:56,046
It's very bold.

455
00:27:56,047 --> 00:28:01,677
As was your decision to represent
them here today, on your own.

I trust you'll do nothing
to harm our cause.

Are you really gonna go
behind Elijah's back?

458
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:10,497
What difference does it make to you
as long as your people benefit?

If I find out that you are playing
some game, trying to manipulate us

I knew you were tough,
I knew you were cunning,

464
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:25,151
but I never knew you were a queen.

As planned, Josh took care of Davina.

I made sure the other harvest
girls got out in the clear.

That was just the warning shot.

I suppose I could just ask him.

Yeah. Make sure he tells you all about

the secret meetings
with the werewolves.

That is, if he's still speaking to you

it would be like to know you.

Now I'm glad I didn't.

00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:52,827
I might have been naive enough
to fall for you, or fear you,

520
00:32:52,828 --> 00:32:56,564
but I learned a lot in death,
and trust me, Klaus Mikaelson:

521
00:32:56,565 --> 00:32:58,999
It's you who should be afraid of me.

522
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,108
Pity. I will miss the sex.

523
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:09,321
Your friend Cami showed up tonight.

524
00:33:10,668 --> 00:33:13,180
Her offering was quite sweet.

525
00:33:13,983 --> 00:33:17,215
So I gave her hope that I
would lift Kieran's hex,

526
00:33:17,216 --> 00:33:18,371
but there is no hope.

527
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,125
Or if there was, there isn't now.

528
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:25,192
If the priest dies, then believe me,

529
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:26,959
you will follow swiftly after him.

530
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:34,170
[Chuckles] It would be foolish of
you to kill me, a potential ally,

531
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:37,471
in defense of some powerless
human who is, by the way,

532
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:40,545
sleeping with your enemy... Marcel.

533
00:33:45,581 --> 00:33:47,148
Hayley: I've learned my lesson.

534
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,915
At first I was against your plan.

535
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:51,886
I thought that we should just
live with Elijah's treaty,

536
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:55,614
but after that party,
those innocent people.

537
00:33:55,615 --> 00:33:57,531
There will never be a peace.

538
00:33:57,532 --> 00:34:01,953
The weak will always be at the mercy
of whoever is calling the shots.

539
00:34:01,954 --> 00:34:03,580
It's survival of the fittest.

540
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:06,375
We need to protect ourselves.

541
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:11,299
And we... we need
to protect each other.

542
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:20,388
We need to use Klaus' help while
he's still willing to give it.

543
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:26,430
But Jackson... From now on, you
have to tell me everything.

544
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:31,069
And no matter what...
We do not trust Klaus.

545
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:43,081
Well, I see that you've already
avenged the little wolf.

546
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:49,292
But judging by your look,
you're still out for blood.

547
00:34:49,293 --> 00:34:51,460
If the definition of insanity is doing

548
00:34:51,461 --> 00:34:54,061
the same thing repeatedly and
expecting different results,

549
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:56,596
then surely my quest
for your salvation

550
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:58,967
ranks me as one of the maddest of men.

551
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,100
Come on, then. What horrible deed
has the bastard done this time?

552
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:08,145
Do you know, in the past,
I actually appreciated

553
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:10,355
the methods to your manipulations.

554
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:13,692
However, now here we are, poised
on the brink of a new era

555
00:35:13,693 --> 00:35:15,944
which will benefit not only
your home but your child,

556
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:19,239
and you go behind my back
to conspire with wolves.

557
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,117
Conspire is hardly the word I
would use for a family council.

558
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:24,130
Lest you forget, Elijah,
they are my family

559
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:25,463
as much as any Mikaelson...

560
00:35:25,464 --> 00:35:28,543
A name, in truth,
I cannot even call my own.

561
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,542
How casually you disavow 1,000
years of allegiance towards you.

562
00:35:33,543 --> 00:35:35,143
And now that I've found the remnants

563
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:37,340
of my other family,
am I to ignore their plight?

564
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:39,745
I would've thought you'd
support my desire to help them,

565
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:42,115
when in doing so,
I help Hayley, and the child.

566
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:44,764
Do not question my allegiance
towards that child.

567
00:35:44,765 --> 00:35:46,519
Oh, and I suppose
your affection for Hayley

568
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,810
has nothing to do with
your tireless dedication.

569
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,025
Yes, you see, I saw how
you cared for her tonight.

570
00:35:52,492 --> 00:35:54,441
Called her name in the dark.

571
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:57,655
The zeal with which you destroy
those who would harm her.

572
00:36:00,796 --> 00:36:05,035
I have denied every single impulse
I have ever had for that woman.

573
00:36:05,036 --> 00:36:06,574
Out of some misbegotten respect

574
00:36:06,575 --> 00:36:09,956
for intentions that
you don't even have.

575
00:36:09,957 --> 00:36:11,944
Klaus: I'm warning you...
Elijah: I'm warning you.

576
00:36:11,945 --> 00:36:14,294
I've forgiven you.
I have stood by you.

577
00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:16,421
I've forsaken every single
one of my desires

578
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:19,466
in the name of your
ridiculous redemption.

579
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:22,806
No more.
If I want something...

580
00:36:24,595 --> 00:36:25,891
I'll take it.

581
00:36:26,739 --> 00:36:32,238
And nothing... nothing...
Will stand in my way.

582
00:36:55,225 --> 00:36:56,259
Cami: Klaus, what are you...

583
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,293
I came here to apologize.

584
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:01,845
I've made a terrible mistake.

585
00:37:02,332 --> 00:37:03,932
Whatever it is, you
should sleep it off.

586
00:37:03,933 --> 00:37:05,564
I'm sure it can wait till morning.

587
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,434
You went to Genevieve.

588
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:11,335
She was moved by your plea.

589
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,974
She may even have cured Kieran.

590
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:15,024
But I insulted her.

591
00:37:16,705 --> 00:37:21,072
And as a means of revenge,
she is refusing him aid.

592
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,590
Kieran will die because of me,
and it will be a horrible death.

593
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:35,086
Why are you telling me this?

594
00:37:35,182 --> 00:37:40,236
Because I believe that
secrets are a poison.

595
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:42,939
They need to be spat out.

596
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,075
Like your secret...

597
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,477
About your time with Marcel.

598
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,519
Isn't that what you wanted?

599
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,899
You compelled me
to go out with Marcel.

600
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,358
You made me your spy.

601
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,528
And maybe it's your fault
we got together,

602
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:06,029
and you're just mad because
you didn't get to control it.

603
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:14,298
You tell Marcel if I see him again,
I'll kill him.

[Indistinct chatter, laughter]

606
00:38:37,798 --> 00:38:39,500
You don't need to keep coming out.

607
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:46,146
I'd tell you if something was wrong.

608
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:47,580
But she's doing ok.

609
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:53,023
The girl has a natural
gift for leading.

610
00:38:53,024 --> 00:38:55,166
She surprised everyone.

611
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:58,062
Not everyone.

613
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:12,216
Do you want to join us?

614
00:39:15,491 --> 00:39:16,955
What I want...

615
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,862
Is for that girl to be happy.

616
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:27,206
Don't tell her I was here.

617
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,955
Marcel: This is Thierry Vanchure.

618
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:39,292
Mean-ass horn player,

[Sigh]

622
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:52,206
I rebuilt this city with him
and he always had my back.

623
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:54,507
Even when I screwed up
and forgot to have his.

624
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:57,677
And now...

625
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:01,485
All I can do is promise you this, t.

626
00:40:03,557 --> 00:40:05,403
I won't let you die in vain.

627
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,360
I will take back our city.

629
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:19,834
Going up against The Originals?

630
00:40:22,185 --> 00:40:24,169
For real, no backing down?

631
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,789
No backing down.

632
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,465
Monique: You failed us.

633
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:56,201
Genevieve: I told you.
It will take time.

634
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:58,635
Do you think the ancestors
care about your excuses?

635
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,471
The vampires attacked us.
We can't retaliate

636
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:03,378
until we possess our full strength.

637
00:41:04,544 --> 00:41:06,614
Your sacrifice is the final step.

What are they saying?

They told me to let you live.

But in exchange, they
want another offering.
