1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,130
那么...
So...

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,000
你们竟然没有一个人回复说参加
couldn't help but notice none of you RSVP'd

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,760
我的杀人推理解密聚会
to my murder mystery dinner party.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,030
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,260
我们打算回复你的
We were meaning to do that.

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,630
不 因为聚会是在一个礼拜前的
No, you weren't because it was a week ago

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,460
而且一个人都没来!
and nobody came!

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:18,560
所以 那个冷落死者Koothrappali 
So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,460
不来聚会的负心汉凶手
Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference,

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,800
就是你们几个
it was all of you.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
我觉得这个不算是推理
I don't think that qualifies as a mystery.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,060
因为我们都知道了啊
We all knew what we were doing.

13
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,630
我们很抱歉 Rajesh
We're sorry, Rajesh.

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,330
要不下周吧
Maybe we can do it next week.

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,360
等等 这补偿有点太过了吧
Whoa, whoa, we're not that sorry.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,260
别担心了 我知道你们不喜欢
Don't worry, I can take a hint.

17
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,400
不会有什么杀人解密聚会了
No more murder mystery parties.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,930
- 太好了  - 哈利路亚
- Great. Thank you.  - Hallelujah.

19
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,760
因为我想了一个更好的主意
Because I've got something even better planned.

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,430
- 噢不! 搞啥啊?  - 别啊
- Aw! Why?  - Come on.

21
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,930
你们先听着
Just hear me out.

22
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,130
我决定让你们参加
I'm going to make you guys

23
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,630
一个寻宝游戏 就像麻省理工他们举办的那个
a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,200
嗯...
Oh...

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
那不错
I loved those.

26
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,630
当时我们每年都玩这个
I did them every year there.

27
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,730
我们普林斯顿也玩这个
We did them at Princeton, too.

28
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,730
哦 真好
Oh, that's cute.

29
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,230
听起来普大像一流大学似的(嘲讽Leonard母校)
Like it's a real college.

30
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,860
真好玩... 我本来打算黑麻省理工的(嘲讽Howard母校)
That's amusing... I was going to say that about M.I.T.,

31
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,200
不过黑普林斯顿也行
but it works for Princeton, too.

32
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,730
哈佛的寻宝游戏很难
Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough.

33
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,700
我每次第一步就被卡住了...
I always got stuck on the first challenge...

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,400
那就是找个队友都找不到
trying to find someone to be on a team with me.

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,600
好吧 这是个悲伤的故事
I guess that story's more sad than funny.

36
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,900
我喜欢寻宝游戏
I love scavenger hunts.

37
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,200
我经常和朋友去玩
My friends and I had them all the time.

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,630
我们说的可能不太一样
Oh, these are a little different.

39
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,830
顶尖的几所名校都有一个传统
There's a tradition at elite universities.

40
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,400
普林斯顿也有
And Princeton.

41
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,730
一个通过解谜题
A tradition of hunts

42
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,730
来寻找宝物的游戏 解谜需要用到
full of puzzles that rely on logic

43
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,560
逻辑 科学和一些偏门知识
and obscure knowledge, science.

44
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,630
我们就是在城里乱逛
Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store

45
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,900
然后找酒喝
that would sell us beer.

46
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,330
那么 谁参加?
So, uh, who's in?

47
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,600
- 我觉得应该很有意思  - 恩 我也来
- I think it sounds fun.  - Yeah, me, too.

48
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,630
- 我玩  - 搞起来
- I'm in.  - Let's do it.

49
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,160
等下 我们是真的要玩
I'm sorry. Are we really doing this

50
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,860
还是跟上次聚会一样
or are we tricking Koothrappali again

51
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,730
耍Koothrappali玩玩的? 
like with the dinner party?

52
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,530
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

53
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,830
* 140亿年前终于爆了炸... 等着瞧! *
* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! *

54
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,500
* 地球开始降温 *
* The Earth began to cool *

55
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,200
* 自养生物来起哄 穴居人发明工具 *
* The autotrophs began to drool, Neanderthals developed tools *

56
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,700
* 我们建长城 我们建金字塔 * 
* We built the Wall We built the pyramids *

57
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,400
* 数学 自然科学 历史 揭开神秘 *
* Math, Science, History, unraveling the mystery 

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,300
* 一切由大爆炸开始 * 
* That all started with a big bang *

59
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,300

为了赢得寻宝游戏
Oh, everything I could possibly need

64
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,530
所需要的道具
to win the scavenger hunt.

65
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,260
你真以为他会把我们带去保龄球场?
You really think he's gonna send us to a bowling alley?

66
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,560
如果去的话
Well, if he does,

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,660
你知道那儿的保龄球有多脏吗?
do you know how filthy those rental balls are?

68
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,300
简直是让我伸进去
They might as well stand on the corner

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,430
做直肠检查
and give away free rectal exams.

70
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,030
好了 大家注意
Okay, everybody.

71
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,160
你们准备好...
Who's ready for a...

72
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,200
去寻宝了吗?
scavenger hunt?

73
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,200
在这个...
Somewhere...

74
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
Pasadena城市某处
in the city of Pasadena,

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
我藏着
I've hidden

76
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,700
一枚金币
a golden coin.

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,930
哦!
Oh!

78
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,660

最后一个谜题
The last of which

85
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,730
则会指出宝藏的地点
will lead you to the coin.

86
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,400
第一个发现宝藏的队伍...
The first team that finds it...

87
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,200
胜利!

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,100
一身的表演细胞啊
He is a born showman.

89
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,560
有问题吗?
Any questions?

90
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,360
我有 为了公平 
Yes, to be fair, do people

91
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,060
要不要让一下普林斯顿的? (嘲讽Leonard)
who went to Princeton get a head start?

92
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,530
这不好笑
That's not funny.

93
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,700
你听懂之后 就会觉得好笑了
Oh, it actually is if you get the joke.

94
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,960
这个讽刺的梗是
It's based on the premise

95
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,460
普林斯顿不是一所好学校
that Princeton isn't a very good school.

96
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,730
哈 哈
Ha-ha.

97
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,360
瞧? 现在他懂了
Oh, see? Now he gets it.

98
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,430
好了 开始吧
Okay, guys, go ahead

99
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,400
分成两个组
and divide yourselves into teams of two.

100
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,160
情侣组队?
Should we just do couples?

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
情侣可以
Couples sounds great.

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,830
也可以试试抽签
Or we could mix things up.

103
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,260
从帽子里抽名字
Maybe pick names out of a hat.

104
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,430
随便了
Whatever.

105
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,430
等等...
Whoa, whoa...

106
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,700
等下
whoa.

107
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,900
你为啥就不承认
Why don't you just admit

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,760
你不想和我一队呢
you don't want to be on a team with me.

109
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,960
我说了"情侣组队也不错"
I just said, "Couples sound great."

110
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,730
我知道了 你认为我是笨蛋
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't think I'm smart enough.

111
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,560
觉得我是个累赘
You think I'm gonna be a liability.

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,860
尽管我说话还用了
Even though I totally just used

113
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,130
"累赘"这种高级词汇
the word "liability" correctly

114
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,060
还用对了
in a sentence.

115
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,700
用对了
Yeah.

116
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,930
好吧 那就... 那就情侣吧
All right, let's... let's do couples.

117
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,030
我想和你一队
I want to.

118
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,100
不 不 不
No, no, no.

119
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,530
我们随机组队
Let's mix things up.

120
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,700
我和Sheldon一队 把你打得屁滚尿流!
I choose Sheldon, and we're gonna kick your ass!

121
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,900
嗯... 真的吗?
Yeah... really?

122
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,730
我第一次组队就得
The only time I'm ever picked first for a team

123
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,960
带着个累赘?
and I'm stuck with the liability?

124
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,900
别这么说 Penny才不是累赘
Stop that. Penny is not a liability.

125
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,800
谢谢 你想和我组队吗?
Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,760
我们还是随机抽名字吧
Maybe we pick names out of a hat.

127
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,800
好了 快点把门关上
All right, hurry up and close the door

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
别让他们听到了
so they can't hear us.

129
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,660
你能别撅嘴了吗?
Would you stop pouting?

130
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,830
是你自己抽到我的
So, you picked my name.

131
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,230
别纠结了
Get over it.

132
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,130
没错 你知道我要抽到你
Yes, and do you know what the odds are

133
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,630
有多难吗?
I'd pick your name?

134
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,760
不知道
No.

135
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,660
还挺难的... 五分之一呢
It's not hard... one in five.

136
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,760
现在你知道我干嘛要撅嘴了
Now you know why I'm pouting.

137
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,600
各小组注意
All right, teams.

138
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,960
准备好打开第一个谜题
Get ready to open your first puzzle.

139
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,030
开始!
Go!

140
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,130
看到我的良苦用心了吗?
Do you see what I did?

141
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,700
第一道谜题就是拼图!
The first puzzle is a puzzle!

142
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,960
天啊 多可爱啊
Oh, my God, how adorable is that?

143
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,700
我真希望我有个像我一样的朋友
I wish I had a friend like me.

144
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,430
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

145
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,860
拼图得从边框开始
You have to start with the edges.

146
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,030
拼图又没有定则 Sheldon
Well, there's no right way, Sheldon.

147
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,630
我已经找到几块能拼在一起的了
I already found a few pieces that fit.

148
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,130
没错 那就拆了它们 从边框开始拼
Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges.

149
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,200
别再浪费时间了
And stop wasting time.

150
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,160
你拼图技术真不错
Wow, you're really good at puzzles.

151
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,830
我小时候经常拼
I did them all the time as a kid.

152
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,130
我妈妈说
As my mom used to say,

153
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,330
"当你拼图的时候
"When you're doing a puzzle,

154
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,460
感觉就像是有一千个小伙伴"
it's like having a thousand friends."

155
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,660
她总是说这样有趣的谎言
She was full of fun lies like that.

156
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,200
比较一下 你会好受点
If it makes you feel any better,

157
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,100
我妈只会吃油腻的蛋糕
my mom's just full of pound cake.

158
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,100
很抱歉 你得跟我一组
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.

159
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,860
我猜你肯定很想和Bernadette一组
I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.

160
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,530
你和Bernadette一起玩过游戏吗?
Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?

161
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,430
没有
No.

162
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,460
你有没有和狼人一起
Have you ever gone

163
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,830
被关在铁笼子里过?
into a steel cage with a wolverine?

164
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,160
快点 快点 快点!
Faster, faster, faster!

165
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,300
你听得懂吗?
Do you not know that word?

166
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,930
就是"再快点"!
It means "more fast"!

167
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
别对我大吼大叫
Stop yelling at me.

168
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,660
嘿!
Hey!

169
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,800
我这可不算大吼大叫
You'll know when I'm yelling at you.

170
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,130
噢 是漫画书店!
Ooh, ooh, it's the comic book store!

171
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,200
好了 我们走吧
All right, come on.

172
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,630
我们得去那儿
That's where we have to go.

173
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,230
但我们还没拼完图
But we haven't finished the puzzle.

174
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,360
这... 这又没关系!
Well, it... it doesn't matter!

175
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,660
我们知道答案了!
We know the answer!

176
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,900
得了吧 你自以为知道了答案
Come on. You think you know the answer.

177
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,660
说不定这是个陷阱
But it could be a trick.

178
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,330
万一等拼完图
What if when the puzzle's complete,

179
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,130
发现窗玻璃上有个标志写着
there's a sign in the window that says,

180
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,200
"去卖小火车的店"?
"Go to the train store"?

181
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
根本不会有这样的标志
Okay, it's not gonna say that.

182
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,860
我希望你错了
Well, I hope you're wrong.

183
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,300
因为我真的很想去卖小火车的店
I really want to go to the train store.

184
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,760
是漫画书店
It's the comic book store.

185
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,860
我们走!
Let's go!

186
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,900
快点 蠢货 是漫画书店!
Come on, numb nuts, it's the comic book store!

187
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,230
是漫画书店 就是漫画书店
It's the comic book store, it's the comic book store,

188
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,900
肯定是漫画书店!
it's the comic book store!

189
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,400
的确是漫画书店
It's the comic book store.

190
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
你觉得Penny在生我的气吗?
Do you think Penny's mad at me?

191
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,400
因为你在右车道
Because you're in the right lane

192
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
前面有辆公交车 你却不超车?
behind a bus and you won't go around it?

193
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,700
她肯定觉得这很迷人
I'm sure she finds it charming.

194
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,600
不是 因为我不想和她一组
No, because I didn't want her on my team.

195
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
我开始觉得她闪过了一枚子弹
I'm starting to think she dodged a bullet.

196
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,000
还是世界上最慢的子弹
The slowest bullet in the world.

197
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,130
天啊 我从来都不知道你那么好斗
Geez, I never realized you were so competitive.

198
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,230
我知道
Yeah, I know.

199
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,700
可能... 是因为我和
It's... it's probably because I grew up

200
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
五个兄弟姐妹一起长大
with five brothers and sisters

201
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,330
所以我得为每个...
so I had to fight for every...

202
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,960
天啊 刚才有鸟飞过 你竟然踩刹车!
Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird!

203
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,830
它们会飞的 懂吗?!
You know they fly, right?!

204
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,830
我觉得这是第一次
I think this is the first time we've ever

205
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,500
我们俩单独在一起
actually been alone together.

206
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,830
我猜你说对了
Huh, I guess you're right.

207
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,730
这是什么原因呢?
Wonder why that is?

208
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,560
要我说 最有可能是因为除了交际圈
Well, off the top of my head, I'd say we don't have a lot

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
我们没什么共同点
in common except for the people we're involved with.

210
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,130
再加上我们刚认识的时候 Penny警告我
Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never

211
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,900
别单独上你的车
to get into a car alone with you.

212
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,960
这样啊
Yeah.

213
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,800
我猜我们的共同点比想象中的多
You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think.

214
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,500
比如?
Such as?

215
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,960
我不知道
I don't know.

216
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,730
跟我说说你喜欢什么
Tell me some things you like.

217
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,960
我想想
Uh, let's see.

218
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,760
我喜欢竖琴 "普雷里的小屋"
I like harps, Little House on the Prairie,

medieval poetry, medieval literature...

220
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,360
要不还是听听音乐吧?
Hey, how about some music?

221
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,760
好啊
Great.

222
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,430
Sheldon从来不让我在车里听音乐
Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car.

223
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,400
他不想别人觉得他是黑社会的
He doesn't want to be mistaken for a gang member.

224
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,230
找点你喜欢的歌

And then the word "He",

307
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,300
并不是那个人称代词男他
it wasn't the masculine pronoun,

308
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,800
而是 "HE"
but rather, "H-E",

309
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,230
氦元素的缩写
the abbreviation for helium.

310
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,060
知道我意思了吗?
See where I'm going with this?

311
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,400
知道
Yes.

312
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,100
装得真像
Nice try.

313
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,400
元素小子的超能力
Now, Element Lad's ability

314
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,530
是改变化学元素本身
is the power to transmute chemical elements.

315
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,160
氦的原子序数为2
Helium has an atomic number of two.

316
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,760
要是你拿2乘以"N"的原子序数...
If you multiply that by the atomic number of "N"...

317
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,200
也就是氮...
nitrogen...

318
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,530
得出14 原子序数14对应的元素是...?
you get 14, which is the atomic number of...?

319
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,830
逗你玩儿的 是硅
I'm just funnin' you, silicon.

320
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,260
而硅是地球表面
And that is the most common element

321
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,360
含量最丰富的元素
in the Earth's surface.

322
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,500
所以就把范围缩小到
So that narrowed it down

323
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,560
地质学实验室和化学实验室了
to the geology lab or the chemistry lab.

324
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,800
哇
Wow.

325
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,730
有什么了不起的 我能在水下喝啤酒
I can drink a beer underwater.

326
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,400
你父母想必异常骄傲
And I'm sure your parents are proud.

327
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,100
最后呢
Now, finally,

328
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,800
"此物便在屋中寻"这句
the line "in this room the thing you'll see"

329
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,260
明显是指
was an obvious reference

330
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
神奇四侠里的石头人
to Fantastic Four member The Thing,

331
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,400
全身都由...
who's made entirely of...

332
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,960
停
Shut up.

333
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,130
我想出来了
I solved it.

334
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,400
是地图坐标
Those are map coordinates.

335
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,500
记下了 走吧
Got 'em. Let's go.

336
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,000
等等
Well, wait.

337
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,800
你... 你不想知道我怎么想出来的吗?
D... Don't you want to know how I figured it out?

338
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,460
百事通注定孤独一生啊 Penny
No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.

339
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,930
# 在船上 在飞机上 #
# On the boats and on the planes #

340
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,630
# 他们要来美帝啦 #
# They're coming to America #

341
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,460
# 再也不要回头 #
# Never looking back again #

342
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,100
# 他们要来美帝啦... #
# They're coming to America... #

343
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,700
呃 你开我的车不要紧
Um, I'm okay with you driving my car.

344
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,760
可是不要飞我的车行不行
I'm not okay with you flying my car.

345
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,730
别担心 我老爸是条子 出了事他救咱们
Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop. He can fix things.

346
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
呃呵
Uh-huh.

347
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,800
死了也能救回来?
Like death?

348
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,100
也许你孩子是个三好学生
Your kid may be an honor student

349
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,460
不过你是个三级脑残!
but you're a moron!

350
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,330
Penny不回我短信
Penny's not answering my texts.

351
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,300
管它呢? 注意力放到游戏上
Who cares? Focus on the game.

352
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
就是因为这个蠢游戏 她才生我的气的
This stupid game is why she's mad in the first place.

353
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,930
我要告诉她我不玩了
I'm telling her I'm quitting.

354
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,930
不行!
No!

355
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,100
你要是考虑感情的话
Quitting would be the worst thing

356
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,260
最坏的就是你退出了
for your relationship.

357
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,360
为什么?
Why?

358
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,830
因为这会让她更加认定
Because it would make you seem like

359
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,660
你是那样的人
something she already thinks you are.

360
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
她认为我是什么样的人?
What does she think I am?

361
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,960
怎么说好呢?
How do I put this?

362
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,500
她一直都用某个女性部位
She's been known to call you a name

363
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
称呼你
that usually applies to a lady part.

364
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,530
或是猫
Or a cat.

365
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,730
或是爱哭鬼
Or a willow.

366
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
我不相信她居然这样说我
I can't believe she would say that about me.

367
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,530
你要是想哭的话
If you're gonna cry about it

368
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,660
我包里就有纸巾
there's tissues in my purse.

369
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,600
也许你自己包里也有
Unless you got some in yours.

370
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,000
大爱哭鬼
Big willow.

371
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,460
# 他们要来美帝啦 #
# They're coming to America #

372
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,360
# 他们要来美帝啦 #
# They're coming to America #

373
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,800
# 此时此刻 #
# Today #

374
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,500
# 就在今天 #
# Today #

375
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,460
# 今天 #
# Today #

376
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,530
# 今天! #
# Today! #

377
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:36,860
哦... 再开30尺
Okay... another 30 feet.

378
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,200
好吧
Okay.

379
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,430
哦
Oh.

380
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,660
是个保龄球馆
It's a bowling alley.

381
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,800
哦
Yes.

382
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,000
太棒了!
Yes!

383
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,960
我真是个旷世奇才!
My brain is better than everybody's!

384
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,130
# 把爱刻在石头上 #
# Love on the rocks #

385
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,260
# 那都不算什么 #
# Ain't no big surprise #

386
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,000
# 给我一杯酒 #
# Just pour me a drink #

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,200
# 谎话说出口... #
# And I'll tell you some lies... #

388
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,430
说我不是爷们
Call me a lady part.

389
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,430
我们走着瞧吧
We'll see about that.

390
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,700
拿到线索了吗?
Can you reach the clue?

391
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,460
差一点
Almost.

392
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,200
快点 保龄球馆里
Hurry, Sheldon and Penny

393
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,930
Sheldon和Penny就在我们后面
were right behind us in the bowling alley.

394
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,560
拿到了!
Got it!

395
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,630
太棒了 爬上来吧
Great,climb back up.

396
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,660
快点!
Come on!

397
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,360
Penny有可能说对了
Yeah, Penny might be onto something.

398
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,460
去天文馆!
To the planetarium!

399
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,400
走起!
Let's go!

400
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,730
{\an8}著名化石遗址 也是个博物馆

401
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,730
去沥青坑!
To the tar pits!

402
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:35,830
走起!
Let's go!

403
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,630
下个月有尼尔・戴蒙德的演唱会!
There's a Neil Diamond concert next month!

404
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,530
走起!
Let's go!

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,930
三个袋子 都没打开
Three bags, no one's opened 'em.

406
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,030
我们是最先到达的!
We're the first ones here!

407
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,260
- 是脏衣服 交给你了  - 什么?
- It's dirty laundry. You're up.  - What? You...

408
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
干嘛给我?
Why me?

409
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,530
因为你一辈子都在
Because you've been training

410
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,660
训练自己
for this your whole life.

411
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,000
怎样在脏衣服堆里生存
You live in a pile of dirty laundry.

412
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,960
他们已经到了
They're here first.

413
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,560
就怪你让我给那个盲人让路 我才慢下来的
This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.

414
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,830
好了 线索一定藏在袋子里
Okay, the clue must be in the bag.

415
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,160
线索一定藏在袋子里
The clue must be in the bag.

416
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
这... 这只有几条裤子
What's... it's just a bunch of pants.

417
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
这只有几条裤子
It's just a bunch of pants.

418
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,630
真不敢相信
You know, I'm surprised

419
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,030
你竟然抄我的答案
you want to copy my answers

420
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,960
你看 我都不够格和你一组
since I'm not even smart enough to be on your team.

421
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,430
你为什么非要和一个
Well, why would you want to be on someone's team

422
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,830
你叫他...
who you like to call a...

423
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,800
我都不好意思在Sheldon面前说出这个词
I can't even say it in front of Sheldon.

424
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,230
你什么意思啊?
What are you talking about?

425
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,130
你知道我什么意思
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

426
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,060
她不知道
No, she doesn't.

427
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,500
这都是我编的
I just made that up.

428
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,830
你为什么要编这个?
Why would you do that?

429
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,400
因为你要放弃了 像个...
Because you were about to quit like a big...

430
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,630
Sheldon 捂住耳朵
Sheldon, cover your ears.

431
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,030
我不是小朋友了
I'm not a child.

432
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,230
我知道"傻瓜"这个词
I know the word "ninny."

433
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,500
你还是早认输为好
Yeah, well, you should have quit

434
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,730
要不然我会把你打的满地找牙的
'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.

435
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,800
真希望我们队也有个这样的汉子
Wish I had a man like her on my team.

436
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,230
我... 我和Penny
Hey, I... I am every bit

437
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,160
一样是个真汉子
as much of a man as Penny.

438
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,300
开始吧!
Now, let's do this!

439
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,060
等等 不全是裤子 有一件T恤衫
Wait, it's not all pants, there's one shirt.

440
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,160
哦
Oh.

441
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,960
嘿 这是我的T恤衫
Hey, that's my shirt.

442
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,600
- 这件也是  - 不 那件可不是我的
- This one is, too.  - No, no, that's not mine.

443
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
上面有个大污点
That has a big spot on it.

444
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
看看这个
But wait.

445
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,700
也有个大污点
So does this one.

446
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,460
也许这个点就是线索
Maybe the spot's the clue.

447
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,460
"Sheldon的点儿"
"Sheldon's spot."

448
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,060
金币藏在你的专座下!
The coin is in your spot!

449
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,300
哦 好机智
Oh, that's clever.

450
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,460
快点!
Hurry!

451
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,930
马上就来
Be there in a minute.

452
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,330
我先用洗衣液泡上!
I just have to pre-soak these!

453
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,800
拦住她 Leonard! 拦住她!
Stop her, Leonard! Stop her!

454
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,460
金币到底在哪里?
Well, where the hell's the coin?

455
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,800
难道不是Sheldon的专座吗?
Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?

456
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,300
你说对了 Leonard
Oh, yes, Leonard.

457
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,360
金币本来在这儿
Yes, it was.

458
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,160
那它现在哪去了?
Then where's the coin?

459
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,930
对啊
Yes, exactly.

460
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,160
现在哪去了?
Where is the coin?

461
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,860
为什么不看一下你们的口袋呢?
Why don't you look in your pockets?

462
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,030
早些时候我悄悄放进去的
I slipped them in there earlier today.

463
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,160
我不懂
I don't get it.

464
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,200
有什么不懂的?
Don't you see?

465
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,860
我们一起享受了快乐时光
When we're all having fun together,

466
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,930
这就是胜利
we're already winners.

467
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,100
等下
Oh, look.

468
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,430
看见没?
See?

469
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,730
我也赢了
Even I'm a winner.

470
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,760
你玩我们呢吧?
Are you kidding me?

471
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,730
这是我见过最蠢的事情了
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

472
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:20,030
你烂透了
You suck so hard.

473
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,360
我是想...
Well, I thought...

474
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,130
我不想让任何人
Come on, I didn't want anyone

475
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,800
因为输掉游戏而难过
to feel bad at the end of the game.

476
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,260
有些谜题又确实很难
And some of those puzzles were really hard

477
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,930
我也不知道谁会沦落到和Penny一组
and I didn't know who was gonna get Penny.

478
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,100
受死吧
Run.

479
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,260
好吧... 我刚不是那个意思
Okay, okay, that... that came out wrong,

480
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,600
你们得承认
but you have to admit,

481
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,800
大家玩得很开心
you all had a wonderful time.

482
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,960
快躲回印度吧
Run to India.

483
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,800
我只是想做件好事!
I just wanted to do something beautiful!

484
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,030
看啊
Hey, look.

485
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,400
我赢了
I won.
