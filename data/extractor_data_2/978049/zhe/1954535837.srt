1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,890
孩子们 2007年的春天 我和罗宾之间的关系发展得很顺利
Kids, in the spring of 2007, everything was great between me and Robin.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,440
所以我们想要进一步发展
So we decided to try and make it even better.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,400
我们决定同居
We decided to move in together.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,330
我打算叫搬家公司的车明早8点到
So, I can have the moving truck here by 8:00 am.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,720
大家觉得怎么样?
Does that sound good to everybody?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,800
顺便问一下 泰德走后 他的屋子怎么处理?
By the way, what are you guys doing with Ted's room?

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,770
如果你们需要分担房租的话 我愿跟你们合租...
'Cause if you need help with the rent, I'll take it.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,570
你为什么想跟我们住在一起
Why would you want to live with us?

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,020
我才不认为你们 那个样子就叫"生活"
I don't call what you guys do "living."

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,360
这么说吧 我需要一间 离这个酒吧较近的房子
Here's the deal, I need a room closer to the bar.

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,820
从酒吧带个女孩回我的公寓
It takes me exactly 23 minutes

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,330
要花上整整23分钟
to get a girl from the bar back to my apartment.

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,190
而在这漫长的23分钟里会发生很多事情
A lot can go wrong in 23 minutes.

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,010
一切都将非常的热辣
This is going to be so hot.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,030
她来付钱
She's paying.

16
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,800
我发誓  如果他不给我回电话
I swear, if he doesn't call me back,

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,220
我就要这么做了
I'm going to go through with this.

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,410
快点 司机
Please hurry, sir.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,680
咱们来点刺激的
I want to do dirty stuff with you.

20
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,970
这事他想都别想
Stuff I won't let him do.

21
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,380
闯一个红灯多加二十的车费
Every red light run is an extra $20.

22
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,530
亲爱的?
Baby?

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,620
不不不  都是我的错
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It was all my fault.

24
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,080
我醉了
I am so drunk.

25
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,350
我一醉就会发狂
When I'm this drunk, I go crazy!

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,070
我相信你会的
I bet you do.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,510
看着啊
Check this out.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,190
出什么事了 我的纽约警察?
What up NYPD?

29
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,160
这么近?
So close.

30
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,140
明白了吧?如果我在这儿住 那我直接带她上楼就行了
See? If I had a room here all I have to do is get them upstairs.

31
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,130
合租吧 大家都会过得很愉快的
Come on, guys. It'll be great!

32
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,190
我们会在你们睡着了以后进去
We'll come in after you guys are asleep

33
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,960
并在你们起床之前离开
and I'll be gone before you wake up.

34
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,820
也就是说 你们做完事后 到早晨让我们喊那讨厌的女孩起床
So, you get to have sex and we get to wake some skanky girl up in the morning

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,290
然后把她轰走?
and kick her out?

36
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,520
拜托 莉莉
God, Lily.

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,330
我当然会告诉她 我的确爱上过她之后假装上厕所
Some guy just told her that he loved her then pretended to go to the bathroom

38
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,780
之后就不会再露面了 你就不能给她沏杯咖啡?
and never came back you can't make her a cup of coffee?

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,160
真不错
Real nice.

44
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,180
你所有的厚夹克都 放在标着"冬季"的箱子里面了
I put all your heavy jackets in this box marked "winter."

45
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,950
所有的花色毛衣都在 标着"比利・克斯比"的箱子里
And all your colorful sweaters in this box marked "Bill Cosby."

46
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,380
真有意思 不过美国人 还是挺喜欢比利・克斯比这小子
Make fun, but America loved that guy for a reason.

47
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:20,630
Wow!

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,970
快完了
Almost done.

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,370
还没呢
Not so fast.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,240
拿着你的剑
Take your sword.

51
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:29,932
Wow.

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,920
- 一个时代结束了 - 是啊
- End of an era. - Yeah.

53
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,230
把这两把剑分开是有点无奈 但是你需要这把剑
It's a bummer to break up the set, but you're going to need that sword.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,340
没错 我住的地方有好多坏人
It's true-- my building is infested with dragons.

55
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,240
我们的大男孩终于要搬走了
Looks like our little boy is finally moving out.

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,780
就像他昨天还是个可爱的小家伙
It seems like just yesterday he was a cute little freshmen.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,810
时而跳瑞格舞 时而玩极限飞盘
Discovering Reggae and ultimate Frisbee.

58
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,300
他这一步比别人迈出得晚 但我们从未催过他
He did it later than the other kids but we never pushed him.

59
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,840
因为我们知道 总有一天他会迈出这一步的
We knew he'd get there.

60
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,170
你们还没有搬到一起 对吧?
You haven't moved in yet, have you?

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,850
你们需要做一下这个测试
Good. You guys have to take this quiz.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,230
我在一本杂志上找到的
I found it in a magazine.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,240
题为"你们准备好同居了?"
It's called the "Are you ready to move in together?" quiz.

64
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,230
如果是"你们穿内裤吗"诸如此类的问题
Well, if it's anything like you're "Are you wearing panties" quiz,

65
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,570
我退出
I'm out.

66
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,420
第一题
Question one,

67
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,500
泰德 你想搬去和罗宾住?
Ted, "Do you want to move in with Robin?"

68
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,430
想
Mm. Yes.

69
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,190
你第一题就错了
Oh, you got the first one wrong.

70
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,250
答案应该是"不" 事实上你想单身
The answer is "no," you secretly want to be single

71
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,490
并且和你的好友巴尼在一起
and hang out with your awesome friend Barney."

72
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,870
第二题
Question two.

73
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,990
你觉得你还能找到比泰德更棒的男孩?
Robin, "Do you think you can score a hotter guy than Ted?"

74
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,070
正确 答案就是尴尬的沉默
Correct. The answer was awkward silence.

75
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,810
第三题 我编了这个 测试是为了证明一个问题吗?
Question three, "Did I just make up this quiz to prove a point?"

76
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,930
是的
Yes.

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,520
是的
Yes, I did.

78
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,230
真的吗?你是说测试题 不是从《老黄页杂志》上抄来的?
Really? You mean it's not from Old Yellow Legal Pad Magazine?

79
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,150
那么 我们都同意啦?
So? We all agree?

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,630
我们把泰德的东西搬回来吧?
We move Ted's stuff back up here?

81
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
我不同意 我们还是想住到一起
Mm... no. We're still moving in together.

82
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,050
为什么?简直疯了
Why? This is crazy.

83
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,630
你不要命啦?那女人...
Ted you're throwing your life away. This girl is blinding you.

84
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,730
用她亮丽的头发 容易让人迷失的乳房蒙蔽了你
With her shiny hair and her boobed shaped boobs.

85
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,250
这对你来说 也没什么好处 你知道的...
This is bad for you, too, you know.

86
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,420
当他看到没化妆的你 你会有什么感觉?
How are you going to feel when he sees you without any makeup?

87
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,760
我现在就没化妆
I'm not wearing makeup right now.

88
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,130
上帝啊 你真漂亮
Holy crap, you're beautiful.

89
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,330
当你不能再偶尔偷偷地 吸烟的时候你有什么感觉?
All right then, how will you feel when you can't sneak the occasional cigarette?

90
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,050
拜托 罗宾不吸烟
Oh, come on, Robin doesn't smoke.

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,580
等等 你吸烟?
Wait, do you?

92
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,320
当然不 为什么这么问?
Of course not. Why?

93
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,380
不要告诉我该怎样生活!
Don't tell me how to live my life!

94
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,060
泰德 我不能让你这么做
Ted, I can't let you do this.

95
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,370
拜托 现在已经进行中了
Come on. This is happening.

96
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,150
与其在那争论 为什么不帮帮我?
So instead of fighting it why, why don't you just help?

97
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,380
- 你希望我帮你? - 是啊
- You want me to help you? - Yeah.

98
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,550
好吧  泰德
Okay, Ted.

99
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,700
我来帮你
I'll help you.

100
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,360
真不敢相信 他帮我们搬了一箱东西下去
Can't believe we actually got him to take a box down.

101
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,530
也许他最终会上路的
Maybe he's finally getting on board.

102
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,200
卡车呢?
Where's the truck?

103
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,660
巴尼呢?
Where's Barney?

104
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,470
等车呢
Wait for it.

105
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,740
简直难以相信 除了这一整箱的锅盖
I can't believe this! Everything I own in the world is in there.

106
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,680
我所有的一切都在那卡车上了
Except for this box of pot lids.

107
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,270
还有这把剑
And the sword.

108
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,140
我要杀了他 我向上帝保证我要杀了他
I'm going to kill him. I swear to God I'm going to kill him!

109
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,990
这把剑现在还是让我给你保管
Right. Maybe I'll just hold on to that. For now.

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,090
马修  这儿只有我们俩了
Marshall, we live alone.

111
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,540
这太爽了!
This is so great!

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,410
现在我们终于可以自由地 过我们梦想已久的二人世界了
We can finally do all the things we always said we wanted to do if we lived alone.

113
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,960
我知道我开始想做什么了
Oh, I know what I want to start with.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,690
我们开始了 是吗？
So, here we are, right?

115
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,950
赤裸裸的坐在公寓里
Sitting around the apartment naked.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,890
- 棒极了 - 是啊
- Awesome. - Yep.

117
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,200
看来没有我想象中的那么棒
It's not as awesome as I thought it would be.

118
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,460
- 我屁股痒 - 我冷了
- My butt itches. - I'm cold.

119
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,810
我也发现了
I noticed.

120
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,040
好像你就是一个聊天的对象
Yeah, like you're one to talk, Pointy.

121
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,650
我不知道你有没有看见我那47条短信
Barney, I don't know if you got my other 47 messages,

122
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,480
如果我的东西在一小时内 还没有出现 我就要报警了
but if my stuff isn't here within the hour I'm calling the cops.

123
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,600
这是我最后一次打电话给你
This is the last time I'm calling you.

124
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,220
因为我的充电器也在那卡车上
Because my charger's in the back of the truck.

125
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,060
别担心 巴尼 他会把东西送来的
Don't worry, it's Barney. He'll bring the stuff back.

126
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,620
知道吗?我希望真正地搬进来
No, it's just... I was really looking forward to settling in, you know?

127
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,310
希望已经放好电视
Maybe setting up my TV.

128
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,340
躺在床上看电影
Watching a movie in bed.

129
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,820
怎么了?
What?

130
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,560
真的要在卧室里放台电视?
Do we really want a TV in the bedroom?

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,470
我想是这样的
I thought we did.

132
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,110
我可不想这样
I'm not sure that we do.

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,510
那好 你说电视放哪儿?
Well, where else would we put my TV?

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,110
我们可以把它放在地下室的储藏室里
We could just put it in our storage unit in the basement.

135
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,470
要是我们想看电视怎么办?
But wouldn't we miss my TV?

136
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,720
- 会吗? - 会
- Would we? - Yes, we would.

137
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,440
那台电视陪伴我们很多年了
We've had that TV for a long time

138
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,570
如果放在卧室的话 会更有家的感觉
and we would feel more at home if it were setup in our bedroom.

139
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,600
- 我们需要喝点酒 不是吗? - 看来是的
- We need wine, don't we? - Yes, we do.

140
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,670
我们要不要到卧室去?
Should we, um, move this to the bedroom?

141
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,910
为什么?
Why?

142
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,980
泰德已经搬走了
Ted doesn't live here anymore.

143
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,480
我们可以在任何地方做这件事
We can do it wherever we want.

144
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,210
还有件事你知道吗?
You know what else?

145
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,300
我们再也不需要保持安静了
We don't have to be quiet anymore.

146
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,670
想多大声就多大声
We can be as loud as we want.

147
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,750
我认为我们需要制订一些基本规则
Okay, I think we need to lay down some ground rules.

148
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,820
我们不需要保持安静 但是不意味着必须出声
Just because we can be loud doesn't mean we have to be loud.

149
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,360
即使这会使你兴奋
And although it might turn you on,

150
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:21,690
你尖叫着"我是最棒的" 这个对我并不起作用
you screaming, "I'm the best," doesn't do much for me.

151
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,770
这比一直大喊"泰德搬走了"好多了
Well, it's a lot better than yelling, "Ted's not here," over and over again.

152
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,380
至少我说的是实话
Well, at least what I said is true.

153
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,930
那不是必需的
Well, that was unnecessary.

154
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,730
虽然我只有这一箱东西了 我想我还是可以打开它
Well, since I only have one box I figure I might as well unpack it.

155
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,030
你说这些东西该放哪儿?
Mm, where do you think we should put it?

156
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,060
我认为可以放在橱柜里 除非你有个专门用来放锅盖的房间
Well, unless you have a separate pot lid room, I was thinking the cupboard.

157
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
怎么了?
What?

158
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,400
关键是我的厨房有点小
Uh, the thing is my kitchen is kind of small.

159
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,810
还有我已经有很多锅盖了
And, um, I already have a bunch of pot lids

160
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,760
而且是带着锅的  所以...
and mine come with pots, so...

161
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,940
你的意思是不可能为我 劳神费力搬进来的
You're saying there's no way to make room for the single box of stuff

162
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,580
这点儿东西腾地方了?
I try to move into our place?

163
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,390
你为什么不把他们放到...
Well, why don't you just take it down to the...

164
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,090
不要说储藏室
Do not say storage space.

165
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,490
我想说的是垃圾箱
I was going to say Dumpster.

166
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:06,640
这箱东西是我在这世界上 唯一财产了
Damn it, Robin, this is all I have left in the world--

167
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,210
八个锅盖和一把剑
eight pot lids and a sword.

168
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,870
是啊 关于那把剑...
Yeah, about the sword.

169
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,540
喂?
Hello.

170
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,730
莫斯比先生 穿上西服
Put on the suit, Mr. Mosby.

171
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,260
巴尼 我知道是你 我的东西呢?
Barney, I know it's you. Where's my stuff?

172
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,480
不是我
It's not me.

173
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,620
如果你还想见到你的宝贝
If you want to see your precious possessions again,

174
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,200
穿上那件西服
put on the suit.

175
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,110
哪件?
What suit?

176
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,570
什么在响?门铃?
Ding-dong. Oh, what's that? The doorbell.

177
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,860
我说的就是那件西服
That's the suit I'm talking about.

178
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:34,010
我还没有走到门那儿呢
I haven't gotten to the door yet.

179
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,750
好吧 到门那了说一声
Oh, okay, let me know when you get there.

180
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,840
好 我打开门了 确实有一件西服
Okay, I opened it. And there's a suit there.

181
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,000
那就是我说的西服
That's the suit I'm talking about.

182
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,030
- 巴尼... - 我不是巴尼
- Barney.... - This isn't Barney.

183
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
但我听说那家伙挺出色的
But I hear that guy's awesome.

184
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,060
好吧  听好了
All right. Listen very carefully.

185
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,140
如果你能完成一系列的挑战 你就可以拿到你的那些东西了
You will get your stuff back if you are able to complete a series of challenges.

186
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,710
任务一 穿上西服
Number one, put on the suit.

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,550
任务二  一小时内到麦克莱儿酒吧见我
Number two, meet me at McClaren's in an hour.

188
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,830
我们都没有见过面 我怎么知道哪个是你?
How will I know who to look for since we've never met?

189
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,600
我长得像巴尼
I look like Barney.

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,410
泰德 你好啊
Oh, hey, Ted.

191
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,430
西装配运动鞋
Suit and sneakers.

192
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,900
有点像艾伦・德杰尼勒斯的风格 (艾伦・德杰尼勒斯 Showtime1982年度"全美最滑稽的人")
A little Ellen DeGeneres but you pull it off.

193
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,140
我没有别的鞋子了  因为你偷走了它们
I don't have any other shoes because you stole them along

194
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,000
还有我的其他财产
with everything else I own in the world.

195
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,500
巴尼 卡车在哪?
Where's the truck, Barney?

196
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,870
巴尼
Barney.

197
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,380
并未被我勒索卡车的那人在叫我巴尼
People's whose trucks I'm not holding for ransom call me Barney.

198
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,650
我想你该叫我将军
I think you should call me The Commodore.

199
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,420
-我是不会那样叫你的... -那你就拿不到你的东西了
- I'm not calling you... - You're not getting your stuff back.

200
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,470
我可以拿回我的东西?
Can I please have my stuff back...

201
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,260
将军...
The Commodore?

202
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,460
不行
No.

203
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,230
情况是这样的 泰德 咱们是哥们
Here's the deal, Ted, you're my bro.

204
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,680
而你即将变成怕老婆的 令人沮丧的  没有尊严的小男人
And you're about to become a henpecked, beaten down, shell of a man.

205
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,880
所以今晚是咱哥俩 最后一次这么开心的聚会
So tonight, we are going to have one last awesome night together as bros.

206
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,920
这是个兄弟散伙会
It's a bro-ing away party.

207
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,100
是个非常特别的时刻
A special bro-casion.

208
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,900
是兄弟抉择的聚会
A bro-choice rally.

209
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,700
是阿波罗上的兄弟们大喜的日子
Bro-time at the Apollo.

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,160
我的兄弟
Oh, bro me.

211
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,970
好吧 我该做什么?
Well, so what do I have to do?

212
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,350
错 不是你该做什么 而是你想做什么?
No, it's not what you have to do, it's what you want to do,

213
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,990
你想在回去之前
and you want to have a good time

214
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,140
度过一个美好的时光
before you go take Fun Ted out back and shoot him.

215
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,670
那么... 第一件事应该是...
So... first thing on the docket...

216
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,600
- 去把那个女孩的电话搞来 - 不 绝不
- get me that girl's number. - Absolutely not.

217
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,080
太糟了
Mm. That's too bad.

218
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:27,000
这样吧 我们设想一下 如果我是你的那些东西
Hey, hypothetical question: if I was all your stuff,

219
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,560
我是想待在东河的底部 还是哈德逊河的底部
would I rather be at the bottom of the East River or The Hudson?

220
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,330
快看 世界级大力士
Hey, look, world's strongest man is on.

221
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,550
是卢・费雷格诺用牙齿把汽车
Ooh, it's the one where Lou Ferrigno pulls the bus

222
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,440
从帕却吉家拖走的那段
from the Partridge family with his teeth.

223
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,940
是最精彩的部分 泰德 快来看
It's the best one. Hey, Ted, get in...

224
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,780
- 就我们俩个 - 恩
- We live alone. - Yay.

225
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,750
我赢了
Well, I win.

226
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,810
你必须把你的 电话号码告诉我朋友
You need to give my friend your phone number.

227
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,510
我真的没想到卢・费雷格诺 可以拖动那辆汽车
Wow, I really didn't think Lou Ferrigno could pull that bus.

228
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,320
你确定这是直播? 看上去画面有点老
Are you sure this is live? It looks pretty old.

229
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,050
是直播  看上去老 是因为电视有些年头了
Yeah, that's 'cause the, uh, TV is old.

230
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,810
那... 我明天可以打电话给你？
So, I'll, uh, call you tomorrow?

231
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,890
可以 不过不要太早 我要去做礼拜
Yeah. Um, not too early. I have church.

232
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,660
兄弟 你很有魅力啊
You were impressive, buddy.

233
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,530
干得不错 好吧 我们开始下一个挑战
Nice work. All right, next challenge.

234
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,330
行啦　不要再挑战了 听着 这是我和罗宾同居的第一夜
No. No next challenge. Look, this is my first night living with Robin.

235
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,670
她可能正为我 在这儿跟你鬼混生气
She's probably pissed I'm spending it out with you.

236
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,270
小朋友  也许今晚 就是我们最后在一起了
This might be our last hurrah, my little friend.

237
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,060
今天我要给你做一顿 你从来没有享受过的超级晚餐
Marshall, I am gonna cook you the best dinner of your life.

238
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,310
你喜不喜欢吃...
How would you like a...

239
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,160
带番茄酱和保鲜膜的鸡蛋卷？
one-egg omelet with some ketchup and film?

240
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,280
我猜平时都是泰德去买东西
Guess Ted's the one who did the shopping.

241
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,390
重大发现 速食比萨
Ooh, look, a microwave pizza!

242
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,930
估计微波炉也是泰德的
Guess the microwave was Ted's, too.

243
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,190
是啊
Yeah.

244
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,220
连浴巾都是他的
So were all the towels.

245
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,700
终于发现在这个公寓里所有 有用的东西都是泰德的
Turns out that everything that was useful in this apartment was Ted's.

246
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,720
所有那些过时的令人啼笑皆非的海报 都是我在大学的时候买的
Everything that was a Foghat poster we bought ironically in college was mine.

247
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,710
马修
Marshall.

248
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,110
怎么了 亲爱的
Yeah, baby?

249
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,910
我想泰德了
I miss Ted.

250
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,450
刚分别就给他打电话是不是太快了？
Is it too soon to call him?

251
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,920
不  我们不能打
No, we shouldn't.

252
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,080
这可是他和罗宾的第一夜啊 我不想打扰他们
I don't want to interrupt his first night living with Robin.

253
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,160
好枪法
Ha, nice shooting.

254
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,730
如果我们再赢一局就可以在 银河系快餐店吃到免费的洋葱圈了
You know, if we win this one it's free onion rings at the Intergalactic Snack Shack.

255
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,750
不错啊
What a bargain.

256
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,690
只要每局游戏交20元钱
We only had to spend 20 bucks a game.

257
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,550
认栽吧　你玩得多愉快啊
Admit it, you're having fun.

258
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,770
也许吧
Maybe.

259
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,940
我觉得那小女孩 掉进那大桶里时挺好玩
I mean, it was pretty funny when that little girl fell over that space barrel.

260
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,120
好样的 我们赢了
Nice... We win.

261
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,360
灰溜溜的走了 游戏输了 怎么了?
Oh, walk of shame, walk of game-- what up?

262
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,180
再来一局?
Okay. Let's go one more.

263
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,640
- 算了吧 - 我知道你想玩
- I don't know. - You know you want to.

264
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,460
好吧 再来一盘 我要先给罗宾打个电话
All right, let's do it-- I just got to call Robin real quick.

265
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,210
这就是以后会发生的事情
Oh, so that's what it's gonna be like from now on?

266
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,470
算了 你给你的老女人打吧 去请求她的允许吧
No. Okay, okay. You call your old lady and ask permission to have fun.

267
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,380
至于我  我要去 吃我们的战利品洋葱圈了
Me, I will be at the Snack Shack eating our victory onion rings Han style.

268
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,060
{\an8}Han Solo 星球大战的男主

269
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,060
我自己去了
Solo.

270
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,840
- 嗨　泰德 - 嗨　亲爱的 听我说
- Hey, Ted. - Hey, sweetie listen,

271
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,300
真不好意思  我很晚才能回去 别等我了
I'm really sorry but I'm gonna be pretty late, so don't wait up.

272
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,650
没事  继续忙你的就是了
Oh, it's totally fine. You do what you got to do.

273
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,140
你真是太善解人意了 我爱你
Thanks. You're the best. I love you.

274
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,980
我也爱你 再见
I love you, too. Bye.

275
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,410
不好意思久等了
Hey, sorry about that. Thanks for holding.

276
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,930
如果您能把《枪与军火》的定金退还给我
Um, so if you could go ahead and cancel my subscription to Guns and Ammo,

277
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,200
我将很感激
that would be great.

278
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,110
不不 这本杂志挺好的 真的
No, it's a great magazine. Really great.

279
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,930
他们还登了我的三封信
They've printed three of my letters.

280
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,580
只是因为我男朋友要搬来和我住
It's just that my boyfriend is moving in

281
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,320
他不喜欢跟武器有关的东西
and he kind of doesn't approve of the whole gun thing.

282
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,420
一个免费的手榴弹电话?
A free hand grenade phone?

283
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,710
这样吧  我给你我工作的地址
You know what? Let me give you my work address.

284
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,640
我搞定了 亲爱的!
I did it, baby!

285
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,610
我买了啤酒 还有食物
I got beer. I got food.

286
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,500
我们再也不需要泰德了
We don't need Ted anymore.

287
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,710
我现在是这个公寓的供应商了
I am the provider of this apartment now,

288
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,450
而且我已经开始供应了
and I have provided!

289
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,650
"P-r-o-v-o-d-e"? Provided (马修在考虑动词的不同时态)
"Provode"? Provided.

290
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,650
总之  我买了我们需要的一切
Anyway, I got us everything we need.

291
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,590
你能把卫生纸递给我?
Could you toss me the toilet paper?

292
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,370
亲爱的再等会儿啊 我马上回来
Be right back, baby. Sit tight.

293
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,390
我得承认 原来我不认为... 但是
Hey, I got to admit, um... I didn't think I would, but, uh...

294
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,360
今晚我的确过得很愉快
I had a really good time tonight.

295
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,550
你真够朋友 巴尼
You're a good friend, Barney.

296
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,690
那兄弟 你何不...
Hey, man, why don't you, uh...

297
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,160
何不告诉我我的卡车在哪?
why don't you tell me where my truck is.

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,600
我可不这么认为
No, I don't think so.

299
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,250
你把我的卡车弄哪去了?!
Where's my truck?!

300
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,120
你知道我为什么 没有把你的东西还给你?
Do you know why I haven't given you any of your possessions back yet?

301
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,060
因为你是英国皇家海军的杰克上将?
Uh, because you're Admiral Jerk of the British Royal Douchery?

302
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,670
因为你不想要它们
Because you don't want them back.

303
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,390
你本来随时可以离开 但是 泰德你没有
You could've left at any time tonight, but you didn't, Ted.

304
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,420
为什么会这样?
Why is that?

305
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,730
因为我不想空着手回罗宾那儿
Because I didn't want to go back to Robin's without my stuff.

306
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,970
错  你知道我怎么想的?
False. You know what I think?

307
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,300
你和她整天腻在一起 感觉不爽
I think you spent one day with her and it already sucked.

308
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,970
你不想去那 她也不想你待在那
I think you didn't like being there, she didn't like having you there

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,030
你们俩同时都意识到这是个巨的错误
and you both realized that you made a huge mistake.

310
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,180
这就是为什么你和罗宾同居的第一夜
And that's why you spent your first night living with Robin

311
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,830
你却在外面陪我玩激光射击
out playing laser tag with me.

312
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,150
这也是为什么三秒钟前
And that's why three seconds ago

313
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,800
你没有说 我家 我们的家 或者 家
you didn't call it "my place" or "our place" or "home,"

314
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,790
而是说 罗宾那儿
you called it "Robin's."

315
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,010
你知道我想说什么吗?
You know what?

316
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,810
你可以拿着我的东西
You can keep my stuff.

317
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,310
怎么样?东西找到了吗?
- Hey. - Hey, did you get the truck back?

318
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,380
没有
No.

319
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,900
为什么没拿回来啊 怎么回事?
Why not? What happened?

320
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,160
他把我惹恼了 所以我回来了
Oh, he pissed me off so much, I left.

321
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,960
我只想回来 安安静静地看部电影
Anyway, I just wanted to come back here, space out and watch a movie.

322
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,740
有没有不是吴宇森导演的电影啊?
Do you anything that wasn't made by John Woo?

323
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,700
为什么 你有?
Why, do you?

324
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,590
不看电影了 我坐下来休息下吧
You know, forget the movie. I just want to sit.

325
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,880
怎么了?
What?

326
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,310
也没啥  只是我 在这张桌子上吃饭
It's just I eat at that table.

327
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,750
那好 我把鞋脱了
Fine, I'll take my shoes off.

328
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,850
你为什么不连同把我一起丢尽储藏室?
You know, why don't you just throw me down in the storage space

329
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,050
看来那儿是这里唯一可以容我的地方
where you have room for me.

330
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
- 泰德 别这样 - 不 是你要这样的
- Ted, come on. - No, you come on.

331
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,130
我今晚一晚上都对巴尼唯命是从
I had to jump through hoops all night for Barney

332
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,950
然后我花了一个小时才回到这儿
and then it took me an hour to get home because his place

333
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,870
因为他家离酒吧太远了
is so far away from the bar.

334
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,390
- 上帝啊 - 怎么了?
- Oh, my God. - What?

335
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,850
我知道巴尼把我的卡车藏哪了
I know where Barney put my truck.

336
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,770
回我住的地方去吧
Let's go back to my place.

337
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,690
我想我家更近些
I bet you my place is closer.

338
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,600
到了
Here we are.

339
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,140
你住在酒吧后的装货月台上吗?
You live in the loading dock behind the bar?

340
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,250
当然不是　亲爱的 这只是我的坐骑
I don't live here, baby. This is just my ride.

341
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,790
不成不成不成 我可不进任何带篷货车
No, no, no, no. I'm not getting into any van,

342
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,790
我看过《沉默的羔羊》
I've seen Silence of the Lambs.

343
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,910
我们在移动的后备箱里喝着香槟
Oh, my God. We're drinking champagne in the back of a moving van.

344
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
这有什么　萨拉 就是这样
Why, yes, Sara. Yes, we are.

345
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,330
那些说你不够活跃的火箭都是疯子
Those other Rockettes who called you slow are crazy.

346
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,940
我就知道  你绑架我
Oh, my God. I knew it. You're kidnapping me.

347
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,620
-　救命 救命 -　不 我没有
- Help! Help! - No, no, no, no.

348
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,130
听我解释
I can explain.

349
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,850
喂?
Hello?

350
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,860
享受旅途的快乐
Enjoying the ride?

351
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,080
泰德?泰德 让我们出去 快让我们出去
Ted? Ted, you let us out of here. You let us out of here this instant!

352
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,680
我不是泰德
This isn't Ted.

353
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,200
但我听说那个家伙很出色
But I hear that guy's awesome.

354
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,550
最后我把萨拉送回了家 把巴尼丢在了离他公寓很近的酒吧那
So I took Sara home and I took Barney to a bar near his apartment.

355
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,970
显然　他还从来没用那个策略
Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.

356
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,340
那个可怜的女孩肯定很困惑
That poor girl must've been so confused.

357
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,430
是啊
Yeah.

358
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,080
至少巴尼得到了深刻的教训
Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson.

359
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,500
想必你是不会愿意被人戳你痛处
You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.

360
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,130
我们是不是该开始搬家了?
So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.

361
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,400
是的
Yeah.

362
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,410
我认为该搬了
Yeah, I guess we should.

363
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,320
在亚马逊雨林的深处
Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest,

364
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,250
有一种树 他们只能围绕一棵大树成长
there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree.

365
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,410
没有那棵树  它就活不了
It cannot survive without this tree.

366
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,630
它被那棵树
It is supported...

367
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,260
支撑着 养育着
by this tree.

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,400
我们就是那种树
Lily, we are that tree.

369
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,350
-　是里面那颗还是外面那颗 -　外面的
- The inside tree or the outside tree? - The outside tree.

370
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,660
- 不是应该有三棵吗? - 不 我和你是一棵树
- Shouldn't there be three trees? - You and I are one tree.

371
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,100
重点是我们是围绕着泰德存活的
Okay, look, Lily, the point is that we grew around Ted

372
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,440
没有他 我们就会慢慢地死去
and without him, we're slowly dying.

373
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,250
我们该怎么做?
What do we do?

374
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,800
我认为我们是要结婚
I think we can marry each other.

375
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,120
但同时要和泰德住在一起
But we also have to marry Ted.

376
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,510
我现在就可以肯定地告诉你 我父亲是不会为这样的婚礼付钱的
I'll tell you right now, my Dad is not gonna pay for that wedding.

377
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,530
泰德!
Ted!

378
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,200
你来这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

379
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,270
罗宾和我不打算同居了
Robin and I aren't gonna move in together after all.

380
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,800
怎么啦?
What happened?

381
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,030
我原来认为我们已经准备好了
I thought we decided we were ready?

382
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,480
我也觉得
I know.

383
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,430
我们怎么得出的那个结论?
How did we come to that again?

384
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,720
我不记得了  我们吵架了?
I don't remember. We were fighting?

385
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,960
- 这个越来越模糊了 - 是啊
- It's all so blurry. - Yeah.

386
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,740
有种说法同居让性生活更美好
The "let's move in together" sex was pretty amazing.

387
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,760
我知道
I know.

388
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,950
我做那事时没用手 通常是要两手齐上的
I did that thing with no hands I normally need both to do.

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,290
你知道吗? 跟你在一起很开心
You know... I'm really happy with you.

390
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,180
在一起很开心 这才是最重要的
I really happy with you. The way things are.

391
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,990
也许我们不该因为那个搅乱了生活
Maybe we shouldn't mess with that.

392
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,790
我也觉得不应该那样
I don't know that we should.

393
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:38,400
知道吗?我听说 不同居性生活会更美好
Hey... I hear the "let's not move in together" sex is pretty incredible.

394
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
还是回我那去吧
Let's go back to my place.

395
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,160
- 谢谢 - 不用谢
- Ooh, thank you. - You're welcome.

396
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,040
- 不 谢谢 - 你会很开心的
- No, thank you. - You'll be very happy.

397
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,570
我知道你们很想独享二人世界
Look, I know you guys are really excited about having the place to yourself.

398
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,500
直到婚后 我想说 如果不是很勉强的话...
Until after the wedding, I mean, if it's not too much of an imposition...

399
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,850
上帝啊 这感觉真是太棒了
God, this feels so right.

400
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,100
永远不要离开我们了
Never leave us again.

401
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,700
伙计们 罗宾还在卡车上 那还有很多的箱子
Guys, Robin's down in the truck and there's actually a lot of boxes,

402
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,190
也许我们应该...
so maybe we should...

403
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,070
我们有时间做这个?
Do we have time for this?

404

Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my hand a copy of tonight's Top Ten list.
