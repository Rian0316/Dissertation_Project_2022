1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,300
****
战士兄弟们 我是征服者Sheldor
我们将要向堡垒出发

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,050
Now,this is a long run,so
let's do another bladder check.
今天 我们将长时间作战
再次检查下 膀胱是否排空

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,940
All right,Barry,we'll wait for you
again,but you really should see a doctor.
好吧 Barry 我们再等你会儿
但你真的需要去看医生了

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,640
Sheldor is AFK.
Sheldor 暂停一下(AFK)

5
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,030
Penny,are you experiencing
some sort of difficulty?
Penny 你遇到什么难题了吗?

6
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,600
Yes. I can't get my stupid door open.
对 我打不开这该死的门了

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,690
You appear to have put your car key in
the door lock-- are you aware of that?
显然你插的是车钥匙
你意识到了吗?

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,160
Yeah.
对

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,530
All right,then.
好吧

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,840
Damn it,damn it,damn it,damn it,damn it!
该死 该死 该死 该死 该死!

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:49,510
Would it be possible for you to
do this a little more quietly?
你可以小声点弄吗?

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
I can't get the damn key out.
这个该死的钥匙拔不出来了

13
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,420
Well,it's not surprising-- that Baldwin lock on
your door uses traditional edge-mounted cylinders,
那是自然不能了
你门锁上用的是传统的边缘锁柱

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,460
whereas the key for your Volkswagen
uses a center cylinder system.
而你的大众车钥匙
是开中央锁柱的系统的

15
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,750
Thank you,Sheldon.
谢谢讲解 Sheldon

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,920
You're welcome.
不用谢

17
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,490
Point of inquiry: why did you
put your car key in the door lock?
关键问题是:
为什么你把车钥匙放门锁里?

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,470
Why?I'll
tell you why--
原因? 我告诉你吧--

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,390
because today I had an audition,it
took me two hours to get there,
因为今天我去试镜 花了两个小时才赶到

20
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,320
I waited an hour for my turn,and before I could even
start,they told me I looked too Midwest for the part.
又花了一个小时才轮到我 还没开始演
他们就说 我对于角色太中西部化了

21
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,590
Too Midwest-- what the
hell does that even mean?
太中西部化 到底什么意思?

22
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,290
Well,the American Midwest was mostly
settled by Scandinavian and Germanic people.
美国中西部的大部分居民 都是
斯坎迪纳维亚人和日耳曼人后裔

23
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,090
- They have a characteristic facial bone structure...
- I know what it means,Sheldon!
- 他们的面部骨骼结构特征明显...
- 不需要你解释 Sheldon!

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,020
God! You know,I have been in
L. A.for almost two years now,
天! 我到洛杉矶都快两年了

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,870
and I haven't gotten
a single acting job.
我没有找到一份专职的演出工作

26
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,380
I've accomplished nothing,haven't gotten a
raise at work,haven't even had sex in six months,
我一事无成 没有升职
6个月没有做爱了

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,080
and just now,when I was walking up those
stairs,a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it!
而我刚上楼梯时
一只苍蝇飞进我的嘴里被我吞了!

28
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,440
Well,actually,insects are a
dietary staple in many cultures.
其实 在很多文化里 昆虫是主食

29
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,910
They're almost pure protein.
几乎全是蛋白质

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,480
Oh,son of a bitch!
他奶奶的!

31
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,780
I believe the condensation on your frozen foods
weakened the structural integrity of the bag.
我想是你的冷冻食物上的水珠
破坏了袋子的结构完整

32
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:08,960
But returning to your key conundrum,perhaps you should
call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.
还是说你的钥匙难题
或许你可以找个开锁匠人来

33
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,850
I did. He said he'll get
here when he gets here.
我叫了 他说到时候他就会到了

34
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,770
And you're frustrated because he phrased his
reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
你因他无意义的重复措辞而沮丧?

35
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,040
No!
没有!

36
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:22,640
I am frustrated because I am a failure at
everything and my breath smells like fly.
我沮丧是因为我是很废材
而且我嘴巴里一股苍蝇味

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,960
There,there.
明白了

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,430
Would you prefer to
wait in our apartment?
你想在我们那边等会吗?

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,880
No,Sheldon,I'd rather sit on this freezing-cold
floor sobbing like a three-year-old.
不 Sheldon 我更想坐在冰冷的楼板上
呜呜的像个三岁女孩

40
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,040
All right,then.
好 回头见

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,890
For heaven's sake.
受不了了我

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,980
Just when I think I've
gotten the hang of sarcasm.
我还以为自己找到讽刺的诀窍了

43

I'm about to level up here.
嗯 说重点 我快要升级了

sense of achievement in their real life,

But probably in a different way.

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,490
She's gotten really hooked on Age
of Conan. She's playing nonstop.

Ah,yes,online gaming addiction.

Oh,yeah? Well,your attempt at juvenilizing me by
excluding me from the set of adult males,just...
噢 什么? 你故意把我排除在"男人们"之外

噢 我没精力跟你斗嘴

No one's supposed to be in my room.
没人能进我的卧室

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,930
I would postulate that she's escaping into the
online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.
我认为 她以网游度日
是因为在性方面得不到满足

235
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,240
I do that,too.

236
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,380
But probably in a different way.

00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,260
That's not what she's doing,Leslie.
不是这么回事 Leslie

238
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,980
She's just trying to shore up her
self-esteem. It has nothing to do with sex.
她只是想增强下自尊心 和性无关

239
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,580

Hang on,Leonard.

While I have no respect for Leslie as a
scientist or a human being,for that matter,
虽然我对于作为科学家或者人类的Leslie
不怀有丝毫敬意

245
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,130
we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the
interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.

这些相关领域的成绩是有目共睹的

246
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,430
