00:00:00,527 --> 00:00:02,896
Where the hell were you
last week, you fools!

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,236
This is Colonel Curt McNally.

3
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,580
I was hoping you could tell me
a little bit about West Point.

4
00:00:07,614 --> 00:00:09,946
Go watch the kids,
please! Okay, guys,

5
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,181
I'm going up to my office.

6
00:00:11,216 --> 00:00:12,552
Debs and Ethel are in charge.

7
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,054
Do you know what this is?
Liberation.

8
00:00:15,088 --> 00:00:18,190
Today, a grocery truck.
Tomorrow, the world.

9
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:20,225
I want to marry Karen.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,893
<i>We can't have sex anymore.</i>

11
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:24,061
Is that my ring?

12
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:25,429
Fuck!

13
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,064
- Are we on for later?
- I haven't decided

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,598
if I still like you, Adam.

15
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,300
You went to high school
with this Craig Heisner?

16
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,637
- He's hot. Sent him your number.
- What's the opposite of thank you?

17
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:39,275
- Bet he thinks you're gonna hook up.
- He's married.

18
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,478
Well, it's a good thing that
I met up with Craig Heisner.

19
00:00:41,512 --> 00:00:43,412
He's married.

20
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:45,081
I was surprised to hear
from you on Facebook.

21
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:46,482
You were always with that
bitchy cheerleader.

22
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:48,450
What was her name, Lucy Joe?

23
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:49,451
You mean my wife.

24
00:00:49,486 --> 00:00:50,985
Oh, shit.

25
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,587
- So that was fun.
- Yeah, it was.

26
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,255
If I weren't married, maybe
things would be different.

27
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,555
- Why'd you want to meet here?
- You said I should

28
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,323
have made a move on you
in high school.

29
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:59,926
What about your wife?
I didn't have a wife in high school.

30
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,294

from Debbie? Come in the pool?

163
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,414
No, thank you, sir.

I know. She won't

176
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:17,240
I'm really starting
to worry that

177
00:08:17,274 --> 00:08:19,041
she doesn't interact
with anybody her own age.

178
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,710
Should I force her or what?

179
00:08:20,744 --> 00:08:23,178
I don't know. I'm making this
shit up as I go along.

180
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,514
How'd she find out?
Lucy Joe?

181
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:27,582
Jesus, what is that, a rash?

182
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:30,251
What? Yeah, I think
it's from that laundry soap

183
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:31,753
I got at the family
dollar store.

184
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,267
Made in China.
Probably tainted with melamine.

185
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,790
No way. You're not
going in the pool with that.

186
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:38,392
- Come on. We gotta show that to V.
- What about my kids?

187
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:40,060
I don't have basketball
practice until later.

188
00:08:40,095 --> 00:08:42,029
- Me and Ethel can watch 'em.
- Ethel and I.

189
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:44,766
You and I are gonna go
show this to Veronica.

190
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,067
Let's go. Go on.

191
00:08:46,102 --> 00:08:49,771
- Be careful!
- Yeah!

192
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,773
Whoo!

193
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,115
You got Jody. Hello?

194
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,817
It's possible for a
guy to be named Jody

195
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,252
and not be a douche bag?

196
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,720
Ever thought about
calling him "Choady"?

197
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,289
Tool hijacked my sex buddy.

198
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:09,391
Revisionist's history.

199
00:09:09,425 --> 00:09:10,925
- What?
- More than a sex buddy.

200
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,927
Nah, that was just
my little brain doing all

201
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,995
the thinking while my ass
was doing all the talking.

202
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:17,497
You guys wanna come on
the ice cream truck later?

203
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,765
Can't. Volunteering at the VA.

204
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,767
- That's a waste of time.
- It's gonna look good on

205
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:21,801
my West Point application.

206
00:09:21,836 --> 00:09:23,270
You know, you should
be figuring out

207
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:25,506
how to work the system
instead of playing into it.

208
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,908
- America is a meritocracy.
- They don't even make boot straps anymore,

209
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,443
then how the hell you supposed
to pull yourself up by 'em?

210
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:32,446
- Dumbass.
- Dumbass.

211
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:36,283
Hey, I'm totally stealing
"Choady," by the way.

212
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:37,785
Veronica's not a real nurse.

213
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:39,587
How's she supposed
to diagnose this rash?

214
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,823
She can at least tell us if it's
worth ponying up for the clinic.

215
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,926
- Uh-oh, you came to hide under the bed?
- I know.

216
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,428
I thought Craig was just gonna
be about coffee and catching up.

217
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:50,097
Just sorta happened.
Would you check out this rash?

218
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,299
Damn, that's nasty.

219
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,468
Almost looks like shingles.

220
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:55,470
Scabies, maybe?

221
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:57,205
Let's see here.

222
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:59,807
Been hiking in the
woods lately?

223
00:09:59,842 --> 00:10:01,509
What woods?

224
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:02,877
I called Steve.

225
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:04,378
- What?
- What? Why?

226
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,980
Change in your diet?

227
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:07,148
I don't know.
I just wanted

228
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:08,315
to hear his voice, I think.

229
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,183
Does your throat hurt?

230
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,518
No. Where is he?

231
00:10:10,552 --> 00:10:11,952
I didn't ask.

232
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:14,822
- Best guess, stress rash.
- I knew it.

233
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,624
Daycare is too much
for you to handle.

234
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:17,825
This is my fault.

235
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:19,994
Why does everything always
have to become about you?

236
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,463
So, no need for a doctor?

237
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,533
Steroid cream first. Should do
away with the breakout, but

238
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,735
if it's stress, you're gonna
have to start relaxing.

239
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,172
We done here? I got a house full
of kids I need to get back to.

240
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:33,040
Gonna call Steve again?

241
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,342
I don't know.

242
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,578
Might wanna figure out why
you wanna talk to him first.

243
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:43,280
This one here is
Mrs. Johnson's favorite.

244
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,519
It likes to drink every day,

245
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:48,155
but this one over here is
a bit finicky,

246
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,225
and only wants a little
sip on the weekend.

247
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,893
Weekends. Got it.

248
00:10:53,928 --> 00:10:57,196
Let me show you
the upstairs plants.

249
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,402
Ew. What the hell
you want with them

250
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:04,403
nasty old boulder holders?

251
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:05,538
I practice opening 'em.

252
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:06,739

- Two weeks?

- Till school starts.
- Deb, you're 11.

the pool and then sleep over.

should have fucked Dottie to death.

I could have made that work.

525!

302
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:29,090
I made it!

303
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:32,761
This is better than sex.

304
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,865
Maybe I'll get lucky, and she'll have
a relapse by the end of the week.

305
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,867
Looks like she'll be
joining you for a drink

306
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,403
- at the Alibi by the end of the week.
- Shit!

307
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:44,072
My room still open at home?

308
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,176
Uh... you wanna stay here?

309
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,279
- It's where the heart is.
- Left side.

310
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:54,749
My advice, no one trades an MVP.

311
00:13:54,783 --> 00:13:58,252
Make myself valuable,
un-tradable.

312
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,521
Exactly.

313
00:13:59,555 --> 00:14:03,358
You know what, the world
out there is a scary place.

314
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:06,930
Maybe it needs to
get even scarier.

it going, man?

316

Good, good.
You know, I'm good, Choady.

Hey, is that
short for anything?

318
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,847
- Uh, Jody?
- Nope.

anywhere these days?

Nope.

From around here, or...?

322
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,257
Wilmette.

323
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:33,058
Family still there?

324
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:34,293
No.

325
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:39,932
Hey, you want to
grab a beer with me

326
00:14:39,967 --> 00:14:42,001
tonight at the Alibi?

327
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:45,771
Kind of hoping my next time at
the Alibi would be with mom.

328
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:47,906
Oh, your mom?

329
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,441
Sheila.

330
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:53,112
Right, well, hey, you know
what you should do,

331
00:14:53,146 --> 00:14:55,013
you should scope
the place out for her first.

332
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,749
Kind of like the
secret service does

333
00:14:56,783 --> 00:14:59,851
before the president
goes anywhere.

334
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:01,419
Copy that.

335
00:15:01,454 --> 00:15:03,022
See you tonight.

336
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:05,791
Great.

337
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:07,994
Yo, can you hustle, please?

338
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:09,529
I know you can run
faster than that.

339
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,531
Ronelle, come on, man.

340
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:14,033
Pretend like
you just stole something.

341
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:15,368
Got to move.

342
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:18,938
Got to push your body.

343
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,373
Rebound. Push it.
Outlet.

344
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:21,808
Push it.

345
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:24,210
Hey, Ethel,

346
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:26,346
you think you might
want to play a little bit?

347
00:15:26,381 --> 00:15:29,016
I could throw you
in there for a few drills.

348
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,551
What are you looking at?

349
00:15:30,586 --> 00:15:32,620
Malik?

350
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:33,822
Are you looking at Malik?

351
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:36,825
Yo, Malik!

352
00:15:38,194 --> 00:15:40,462
What's up, coach?

353
00:15:40,497 --> 00:15:42,531
This is Ethel.

354
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,665
Hey.

355
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,666
Hello.

356
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,468
This your little brother?

357
00:15:46,502 --> 00:15:48,369
No, this is Jonah, he's my son.

358
00:15:48,404 --> 00:15:50,571
Oh, no shit?

359
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:54,075
We should get our kids together for
a play date, or some shit like that.

360
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:55,810
Oh! How old is
your...?

361
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:59,379
- Girl. 13 months tomorrow.
- Such a sweet age.

362
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:01,515
You better stay away
from my man.

363
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,319
Tanisha, why you trippin'? You
know we're not together no more.

364
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:06,154
I meant no harm, Tanisha.

365
00:16:06,188 --> 00:16:08,156
Where I come from, it's an
honor to share your man.

366
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,060
Really? How about I honor you
with a brick upside your head?

367
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,595
All right, all right, Tanisha.

368
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:13,930
This isn't <i>Jerry Springer.</i>
Calm down.

369
00:16:13,964 --> 00:16:15,365
Put all that spunk
out on the court.

370
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,233
You, too. Go.

371
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,338
You're a little shit starter.

372
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,048
Frank?

373
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:35,520
Frank, can you come take
a look at the stove?

374
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:37,088
It's not lighting.

375
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,722
You got it, babe.

376
00:16:38,757 --> 00:16:40,924
I just smelled gas, honey.

377
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,760
It was fine this morning.

378
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:48,598
Let's see what we got here.

379
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:52,634
Aha.
Just a little loose.

380
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:53,435
Oh.

381
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,204
Voila.

382
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:57,906
Thank you, Frankie.

383
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,941
- That's what I'm here for.
- Oh!

384
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,744
Boy, glad you noticed that.

385
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:04,546
Could have blown
up the whole house.

386
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,248
Took out an entire block
in California. 16 dead.

387
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,383
I know. Terrible.

388
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:09,818
Did you see that article

389
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,119
- in the paper yesterday?
- What article?

390
00:17:11,153 --> 00:17:12,754
A guy walked into a market

391
00:17:12,788 --> 00:17:14,723
and cut off a woman's
head with a machete.

392
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:15,890
Which market?

393
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:17,058
What?

394
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,226
Which market was it?

395
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,061
Who cares?

396
00:17:20,096 --> 00:17:22,297
What matters is that he
would do that for no reason.

397
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,001
- Well, he must have had a reason.
- Says he just went nuts.

398
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:29,071
Well, that's a reason.

399
00:17:29,105 --> 00:17:33,276
I'm trying to tell you it's
dangerous out there, Sheils.

400
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,079
So promise me you
won't go to a market.

401
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:38,349
Well, Frank, you never
told me which market.

402
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,852
Any of 'em. Ever!

403
00:17:40,886 --> 00:17:43,654
I don't want anything

404
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,590
to happen to you,
because I love you.

405
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:50,161
So stop asking stupid
fucking questions.

406
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,930
Frank, sweetie, I love you too,

407
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,667
but I have learned in therapy

408
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,703
that you can't control what
goes on in the world.

409
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:04,374
No, you can just choose to be
a part of it every single day.

410
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,285
Ha-ha! I almost didn't make it.

411
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,453
I had to take
the long way around

412
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,354
to avoid Lucy Joe
and her banner.

413
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,795
Don't you wish the sex
was worth the punishment?

414
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,200
Hi, Craig, you need to call off your
mouth-foaming-bitch-of-a-wife!

415
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:32,634
And this is Fiona Gallagher.

416
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:33,669
Thank you.
Bye.

417
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:35,137
Smooth.

418
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:37,139
I still don't understand
why he told her.

419
00:18:37,173 --> 00:18:39,641
'Cause he's a pussy.
You always pick pussies.

420
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,244
Well, they are what they eat.

421
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:44,881
Oh, Richard's back from
France this week.

422
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,383
The Jasmine set-up?

423
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,351
Yeah, me, Jasmine, David
and him are gonna hang out.

424
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:49,653
- Maybe you and Kev?
- Pass.

425
00:18:49,687 --> 00:18:51,722
Have fun in the
Viagra triangle.

426
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,423
Deb's having a sleepover
party night after next

427
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,726
'cause I told her that she had to.
And you have to come.

428
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,661
Oh, I can't. I'm working
overnight at the home.

429
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:59,330
Do you want to
hear her guest list?

430
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:02,166
- Fiona, Veronica and Aunt Ginger.
- Poor kid.

431
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,336
Three people on her list, and two of 'em
are stuck in an old age home all night.

432
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,870
She's got no friends, V.

433
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:10,706
How did I not see that
she had no friends?

434
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,009
Hey, you.
Can I see some ID, please?

435
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:16,177
Are you kidding me?

436
00:19:16,212 --> 00:19:19,113
- Show me something. I gotta cover my ass.
- All right.

437
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,855
Thank you, Dwayne Foster.

438
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,558
Can I just get a coke?

439
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:38,032
Now, why would you do that?

440
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,200
What?

441
00:19:39,234 --> 00:19:41,002
Not drink.

442
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:47,208
Gotta piss.

443
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,280
How the hell am I supposed

444
00:19:52,314 --> 00:19:54,382
to loosen him up and get
any shit on this guy

445
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,616
if he's stone sober?

446
00:19:55,651 --> 00:19:57,985
Man, I'm telling ya,
I don't think the guy has any

447
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,887
- dirt on him at all.
- He's gotta have an angle.

448
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:02,456
I think he's just some
Joe-bag-a-donuts dude.

449
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:06,761
Or a John Wayne Gacy.
I'm gonna pinch his wallet.

450
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:09,564
Hey, got your coke.

451
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:13,668
Weird, Karen's number's
written in the stall.

452
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:14,902
Oh. There you go.

453
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:17,572
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry, man.

454
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:19,740
I uh, I got some on my leg.
I'll be right back.

455
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:21,675
Ah, I'm sorry about that.

456
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:33,486
Fucking dick.

457
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:41,427
Give me his fucking wallet
and phone, you retard.

458
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:45,265
You know, that dyke chick on <i>Glee</i>
says it's not cool to use that word.

459
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,335
Why are you such a dick?

460
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,869
On the subject of dicks,

461
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:50,605
does Choady have
a choad, or what?

462
00:20:52,308 --> 00:20:54,142
You're better
than this guy, Karen.

463
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,052
Thing is, Lip, I'm not.

464
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:20,334
Malik may come by
today with Tamika,

465
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:22,202
if that's okay.

466
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:23,737
Fine. But they eat,
we charge 'em.

467
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:26,874
Thought you'd still be asleep.

468
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:28,642
We have a party to plan.

469
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:31,912
Most important part of any birthday
celebration-- the cake.

470
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,680
What are you feelin'?

471
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:36,215
Strawberry and cheese
coffee cake from Weber's bakery.

472
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,716
Definitely.

473
00:21:37,751 --> 00:21:41,086
Even your taste in food is
like a 40-year-old.

474
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,522
Okay, it's your party.

475
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,992
Triple espresso lattes!

476
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,160
Hey, Jasmine.

477
00:21:48,194 --> 00:21:49,494
Does she have a key now?

478
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:50,996
It was open.

479
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:55,100
You really shouldn't sleep
in your makeup, by the way.

480
00:21:55,134 --> 00:21:56,735
Just look at Courtney Love.

481
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:59,104
Ooh, you are so welcome,
miss Debbie.

482
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:02,240
- So, has he called you?
- Who?

483
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:03,775
Richard.
I gave him your number.

484
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,410
Of course you did.

485
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:07,712
You haven't been home yet,
have you, dirty girl?

486
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:09,247
Spent the night
on David's boat.

487
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:11,182
Richard's somewhere on
business. Rome? Singapore?

488
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,516
Someplace exotic.

489
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:14,618
I got a little
left over from last night.

490
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:16,086
You want some?

491
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,954
Jesus, it's 8:00
in the morning.

492
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:19,856
David, I think, might be
taking me to Paris.

493
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:22,259
He's got some kind
of conference.

494
00:22:22,293 --> 00:22:24,295
What are you going to tell Hal?

495
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:26,530
Uh, I don't know,
I'll think of something.

496
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:28,432
What'd you tell him last night?

497
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:31,402
My mom's sick. I've been
nursing her back to health.

498
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:33,938
You're using your mom's breast
cancer to cheat on your husband?

499
00:22:33,972 --> 00:22:36,074
It's the only good thing
about her double mastectomy.

500
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,409
Daughter of the year.

501
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,977
You're one to talk.

502
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,446
Mrs. Heisner been back around
with the baby and the bat?

503
00:22:41,481 --> 00:22:43,215
You hear about that?

504
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,250
It's priceless.

505
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:50,055
Oh. My ball and chain.

506
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:52,458
I got to get back home.

507
00:22:52,493 --> 00:22:55,128
Do you mind if I shower
and change upstairs?

508
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:56,629
Sure.

509
00:22:56,664 --> 00:22:58,231
Oh, and when Richard does call,

510
00:22:58,265 --> 00:23:00,633
just say yes.
He's a good one.

511
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:03,003
He's got the cash to
treat you right,

512
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:06,273
and he can probably
still get it up on his own.

513
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:10,111
Did you know that the
trigonometric moment problem

514
00:23:10,145 --> 00:23:11,913
has infinitely many solutions

515
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:13,815
if the Toeplitz
matrix a is invertible?

516
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,518
Yeah. Nothing but
parking tickets.

517
00:23:16,552 --> 00:23:18,520
This Choady guy makes
vanilla taste like

518
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:19,921
fucking thai spice.

519
00:23:19,956 --> 00:23:21,456
You ran a background check?

520
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,957
Tony.

521
00:23:22,991 --> 00:23:24,959
You know, the only
remotely interesting thing

522
00:23:24,993 --> 00:23:26,093
is a restraining order

523
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:27,461
against his ex-girlfriend

524
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:28,996
because she threw
a camera at him.

525
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,697
He's fucking
ridiculous, this guy.

526
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:33,933
You're like Liam when someone
touches one of his toys.

527
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:37,203
I don't find any dirt,
I'll just have to make some.

528
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:38,471
You guys think
you could hang out

529
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,006
at some point Saturday night?

530
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,641
Deb's sleepover-- help
fill out the guest list?

531
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:44,845
- Sure. - Yeah, I'll bring some
strippers and a hookah pipe.

532
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:48,015
I'm kidding.

533
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:49,550
I thought it was funny.

534
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:54,355
♪ the people on the bus
all smell like pee ♪

535
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,826
♪ smell like pee,
smell like pee ♪

536
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,561
♪ the people on the bus
all smell like pee ♪

537
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:02,863
♪ most likely because
they peed. ♪

538
00:24:02,898 --> 00:24:06,800
you know what works?
Unfiltered apple juice.

539
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:08,801
I'm gonna try that.
This little girl here

540
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:10,837
hasn't made a dookie
in like, three days.

541
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:11,938
Poor baby.

542
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:17,643
So you live with your
great-grandparents?

543
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:19,545
I do, which is pretty cool.

544
00:24:19,579 --> 00:24:23,215
I mean, they're good people
and all, but it sucks

545
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,085
because they're getting so old it's
kind of hard for them to do stuff

546
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,155
like go to the park, lift
things, work the remote.

547
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:31,724
Hmm, it's the same with
my husband, Clyde.

548
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:34,762
We had to get one of those
phones with the giant numbers.

549
00:24:34,796 --> 00:24:35,997
Oh.

550
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,266
Need a hand with
this diaper change.

551
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,767
All the way up the back.

552
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,103
- Oh.
- I'll be back in a minute.

553
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:44,005
Okay.

554
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:48,876
- Whoa!
- Oh! I know!

555
00:24:48,911 --> 00:24:50,511
- Oh, God.
- Got to tell his mom

556
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:52,447
to knock it off with
the fruit strips.

557
00:24:52,481 --> 00:24:54,282
Get the wipes, quick.

558
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:57,451
So, are you and Malik like,
boyfriend and girlfriend now?

559
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:00,221
What? Shh...

560
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:02,356
No, of course not.
We're just friends.

561
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:04,459
He totally likes you.

562
00:25:04,493 --> 00:25:07,896
We have a lot in common because
of our children, but that's it.

563
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,031
Uh-uh-uh-uh!

564
00:25:09,065 --> 00:25:12,301
Besides the fact that
I'm already married.

565
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:16,105
So, Clyde gets to have ten wives,
but you can only have one husband?

566
00:25:18,008 --> 00:25:23,446
Lamp's on the fritz.
I'll look at it later today.

567
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,481
Where are you going?

568
00:25:25,515 --> 00:25:28,117
- Karen and I are going to look
at wedding dresses. - What?

569
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:31,386
What did I tell you about what can
happen to a woman shopping?!

570
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,056
Sheils, I need
you here with me.

571
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,591
Safe. With your head on.

572
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,726
Sweetie, nothing's
going to happen.

573
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:39,061
I'll be with Karen.

574
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:41,130
We'll use the buddy system.

575
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,299
Don't worry.

576
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,801
Karen!

577
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,170
You're not going to take
Cole Street, are you?

578
00:25:48,205 --> 00:25:50,640
That woman was just
attacked on Cole street.

579
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,141
What woman?

580
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:55,012
Uh, 77 years old.

581
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:56,781
Animal tried to rape her.

582
00:25:56,815 --> 00:25:59,751
Luckily, her dog
scared him away.

583
00:25:59,785 --> 00:26:01,753
We should get a dog.

584
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:03,521
We have Frank.

585
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,691
The hell is that
supposed to mean?

586
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,293
You <i>have</i> shit on the carpet.

587
00:26:07,327 --> 00:26:08,527
You know,
why do you have to...?

588
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:10,496
You guys, listen,

589
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,032
this is a big day
for me, all right?

590
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:14,300
No bickering.

591
00:26:14,334 --> 00:26:15,535
Sorry, mom.

592
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:17,037
Let's go.

593
00:26:17,071 --> 00:26:18,872
Go get 'em, mom.

594
00:26:18,907 --> 00:26:20,908
Thanks, Jody.

595
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,044
Proud of her.

596
00:26:24,078 --> 00:26:26,313
Yeah, no, me, too.

597
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:28,882
I just hope she doesn't
push herself too hard.

598
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:32,018
Her doctor tells me she's
very fragile right now,

599
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,553
ripe for a relapse.

600
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:36,189
I hear you, man, Karen's
pretty fragile, too.

601
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:39,959
Not the first word
that comes to mind, but okay.

602
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:41,727
Like a baby deer in the forest

603
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,729
and life's like the hunter.

604
00:26:45,531 --> 00:26:48,166
<i>I think you should try</i>

605
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,401
to expand your
social circle a little.

606
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:53,170
Why? You have us and V
and your pushy friend Jasmine,

607
00:26:53,204 --> 00:26:54,738
and that seems to be enough.

608
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:57,073
I'm actually trying to
expand my circle, too,

609
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,575
meet new people.

610
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:12,056
What about Ethel?

611
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,891
Why not invite her?

612
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,492
She's more of a colleague.

613
00:27:15,527 --> 00:27:18,496
- Come on.
- Okay, fine, so it'll be you,

614
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,563
me, and Ethel.

615
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:21,232
And... and Carl.

616
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,867
- What?
- Saturday night,

617
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:24,235
you're coming
to Deb's sleepover.

618
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:25,369
Sounds gay.

619
00:27:25,404 --> 00:27:27,238
- You can bring a friend.
- Okay.

620
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,773
I want you to invite
two more kids

621
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:30,107
from your class that you like.

622
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,442
I don't like any
kids in my class.

623
00:27:31,476 --> 00:27:33,911
Well, then, two more
that you sort of like

624
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,214
or can stand to be around
or think are cool

625
00:27:36,248 --> 00:27:38,616
or think maybe might like you.

626
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,685
Hey, you're a good kid, Deb.

627
00:27:41,719 --> 00:27:43,187
You deserve friends.

628
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,592
No money, no drink.

629
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:49,894
I'm not here to drink.

630
00:27:49,928 --> 00:27:51,462
I'm here to borrow something.

631
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:53,097
A brain or a heart?

632
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:56,033
- That.
- Stan's Luger? No way.

633
00:27:56,068 --> 00:27:58,970
He pulled that off a dead
kraut's fingers on the rhine,

634
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:01,706
then shot the guy in the nuts
just for shits and giggles.

635
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
Can I just see it?

636
00:28:02,775 --> 00:28:04,910
You can see it from there.

637
00:28:13,453 --> 00:28:16,388
♪ ah... ♪

638
00:28:16,422 --> 00:28:19,491

639
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,797

641
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:29,802
Debbie, hi,

642
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:31,137
I was just about
to cross check.

643
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:32,171
You want to watch?

644
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,972
Bullshit.

645
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:35,240
Where?

646
00:28:35,275 --> 00:28:37,643
There.

647
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:40,179
You know Holly Herkimer, right?

648
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:41,347
Holly hickey-maker?

649
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:42,915
Yeah, why?

650
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,817
Son of a bitch.

651
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,520
You introduce me to Holly,
you can come to my sleepover.

652
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:49,188
Cool, w-when is it?

653
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:50,456
Tomorrow.

654
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,324
Okay, yeah, let me just
check my schedule.

655
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,428
Yeah.

656
00:28:55,462 --> 00:28:56,996
Yeah, that should,
that should work.

657
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,965
Great.

658
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:07,541
Gearing up for
bank robbery season?

659
00:29:07,576 --> 00:29:08,942
I don't have any
whippets, Frank.

660
00:29:08,977 --> 00:29:10,177
Saw a couple spray paint cans

661
00:29:10,211 --> 00:29:11,445
behind the liquor store
you could huff.

662
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,013
Why do you think
I want something?

663
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,381
You're breathing.

664
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:15,715
Hoping to gank

665
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:18,051
a couple of rounds
of ammo from you.

666
00:29:18,085 --> 00:29:20,353
Who you hunting?

667
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:22,722
Trying to scare off
a neighborhood dog.

668
00:29:22,757 --> 00:29:25,992
Yeah, anybody I know?

669
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:27,527
A fucking Luger?

670
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:28,795
That's sweet, man.

671
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,363
It was my father's.

672
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:32,199
Hey, I don't think they make
ammo for that anymore.

673
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:34,034
- Ah, come on, just one cap.
- What do you mean one cap?

674
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,502
Slugs are specific
to each gun, Frank.

675
00:29:35,536 --> 00:29:36,970
It's not a fucking
mix and match.

676
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:38,205
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

677
00:29:38,239 --> 00:29:40,073
Guns ain't garanimals.

678
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:41,841
Look at that.

679
00:29:41,876 --> 00:29:43,576
Perfect fit.

680
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,189
Aah, Jesus.

681
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:59,491
What the hell was that?

682
00:29:59,526 --> 00:30:00,826
I'm sure it was just

683
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,761
a car backfiring, sweetie.

684
00:30:03,796 --> 00:30:06,364
Scratched cornea.

685
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,099
Brass bits and gas
ripped into my eye.

686
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,101
You're lucky that's all
that happened to you.

687
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:12,103
Cartoons-- whole
head explodes.

688
00:30:12,137 --> 00:30:15,439
She's not giving up, Kev.

689
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:17,574
Sheila's going to be down here
tomorrow unless I can stop her.

690
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:19,576
Maybe it won't even
be that big a deal.

691
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:21,912
She'll come down, she'll
sit down, have a drink,

692
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,246
laugh a little, dance maybe.

693
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,248
Could be totally harmless.

694
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:27,451
I know we all love

695
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:29,853
to bust balls around here,

696
00:30:29,887 --> 00:30:33,223
but seriously, guys, if
Sheils makes it down tomorrow,

697
00:30:33,257 --> 00:30:35,292
you promise to keep your
mouths shut about me?

698
00:30:35,326 --> 00:30:36,793
- No. - Yeah, right.
- Fuck you.

699
00:30:36,828 --> 00:30:39,195
You banged her kid--
I'm telling.

700
00:30:50,343 --> 00:30:52,711
Dan, my man.

701
00:30:54,414 --> 00:30:55,949
- Ha.
- Very funny, asshole.

702
00:30:55,983 --> 00:30:57,217
Oh, come on,

703
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:59,085
I'm just messing with you.

704
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,121
Look at us, we look like
a couple of pirates.

705
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:04,990
Let me buy you a
drink, ol' Danny boy.

706
00:31:07,861 --> 00:31:10,262
What do you want, Martin?

707
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:11,496
Uh, uh,

708
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:13,998
s-Simon... my, my name is Simon.

709
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:16,267
This is my friend
Debbie Gallagher.

710
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:18,402
Hi, we're actually in
the same history class.

711
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:20,171
We are?

712
00:31:20,205 --> 00:31:22,473
I let you cheat off
me all the time.

713
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:25,010
Oh, good for you.

714
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:26,445
Um...

715
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,282
Gallagher-- any relation to Lip?

716
00:31:30,316 --> 00:31:32,785
Yeah, he's my brother.

717
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:34,520
It's short for Philip.

718
00:31:34,554 --> 00:31:36,522
Lip is.

719
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:41,494
So I was just wondering

720
00:31:41,528 --> 00:31:43,763
if maybe you'd want to
come to my sleepover

721
00:31:43,797 --> 00:31:46,332
tomorrow night?

722
00:31:46,366 --> 00:31:47,767
Is there going to be food?

723
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,168
Hell, yeah.

724
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:51,537
- Can we watch an R-rated movie?
- Sure.

725
00:31:51,572 --> 00:31:53,606
Is your brother going
to be there?

726
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,642
Probably, yeah.

727
00:32:00,246 --> 00:32:02,214
Okay.

728
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,618
Oh, cool.

729
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:07,020
I'll see you there.

730
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,860
Linda doesn't know it yet,
but she's letting me borrow

731
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:14,195
her kids' Kinect
for Deb's party.

732
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,831
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

733
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:20,236
What are you watching?

734
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,573
Some shit on the Learning
Channel about pole dancers.

735
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,040
Speaking of hookers,
how's Karen?

736
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,009
Fuck off.

737
00:32:27,043 --> 00:32:29,211
Still working
on Operation Choady.

738
00:32:29,246 --> 00:32:31,880
Got a couple ideas
on how to lose the guy.

739
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,348
Why don't we just kill him?

740
00:32:33,383 --> 00:32:34,884
So not worth the time
in jail, dude.

741
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:36,852
I was thinking something
more along the lines

742
00:32:36,887 --> 00:32:39,722
of planting naked photos
of Liam on his laptop.

743
00:32:39,756 --> 00:32:40,990
Oh, good one.

744
00:32:41,024 --> 00:32:42,391
Yeah, I thought so.
All right.

745
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:48,764
Now, seriously, this does
nothing for you?

746
00:32:50,934 --> 00:32:53,268
Eh... still gay.

747
00:32:53,302 --> 00:32:54,870
Still gay.

748
00:32:54,904 --> 00:32:56,271
<i>Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down</i>
is X-rated.

749
00:32:56,306 --> 00:32:58,373
I said you could watch
something R-rated.

750
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:00,275
It's got to be edgy
an-and cool.

751
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:02,677
The object is to be
scared, not scarred.

752
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:05,279
Maybe Lip and Ian
have something.

753
00:33:05,313 --> 00:33:06,780
You are not gonna be happy.

754
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:08,448
We got to work tomorrow night.

755
00:33:08,483 --> 00:33:10,217
I can't, Deb's party
is tomorrow night.

756
00:33:10,251 --> 00:33:12,219
Well, Ivan rented out the place
for a private party.

757
00:33:12,253 --> 00:33:14,621
You're the one who made me
have the stupid party.

758
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,389
You flake, it's gonna suck.

759
00:33:16,424 --> 00:33:18,124
- No, it won't.
- Yes, it will!

760
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,526
Can somebody else
take my shift?

761
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,094
Some Richard dent
hall of fame party.

762
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:23,396
Said anybody who
doesn't work is fired.

763
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,265
Maybe we can make
the party another night.

764
00:33:25,299 --> 00:33:26,866
Work your shift.

765
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:29,235
- We got the party.
- You can be here all night?

766
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,937
Of course-- it's going to be
the hottest party ever.

767
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:32,205
Mandy's coming, too.

768
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,876
Oh, my God, this is going

769
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,077
to be so cool.

770
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:54,461
It's Steve.

771
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:56,830
Leave some words.

772
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:58,765
Total long shot--

773
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,167
do you want to come to Debbie's
sleepover tomorrow night?

774
00:34:02,202 --> 00:34:04,737
Might be tough coming
from halfway around the world.

775
00:34:04,772 --> 00:34:06,573
I mean, it looks

776
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:09,843
like I may not even be able to
make it, and I live right here.

777
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:12,680
I'm making no sense.

778
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:14,916
Okay.

779
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:16,952
Call me.

780
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:23,459
♪ maybe too quiet... ♪

781
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:28,497
♪ you've been holding back now ♪

782
00:34:37,673 --> 00:34:39,640
good morning, baby.

783
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:40,974
Morning.

784
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:42,476
Where's Ethel?

785
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,545
She's over at Malik's crib
having a playdate.

786
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,513
You let her go?

787
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:48,148
They're just friends.

788
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:50,484
Boys like Malik don't have
friends with vaginas.

789
00:34:50,518 --> 00:34:52,286
Well, I just think it's awesome
that she's hanging out

790
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,621
with people her own age, doing
something other than chores.

791
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:56,657
He's probably got her
doing his chores.

792
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,158
What's your beef with Malik?

793
00:34:58,193 --> 00:35:00,294
I don't want Ethel
dating that black kid.

794
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:01,562
Racist.

795
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:02,830
You're a racist.

796
00:35:02,864 --> 00:35:04,131
I am not a racist.

797
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,067
I don't hate all
black people, Kev,

798
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:09,404
just the ones who make babies
at 14 and probably can't read.

799
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,344
What the hell you smiling at?

800
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:17,246
- You're a mama bear.
- What?

801
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,249
You're turning into a mama bear
with your little baby Ethel cub.

802
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,317
Shut up.

803
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:24,652
- My mama bear.
- Shut it down.

804
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:25,887
My little mama bear.

805
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:29,057
So, you're kind of
like a 12-year-old girl.

806
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:30,391
Which flick do you think

807
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:31,659
we should watch tonight
at Deb's party?

808
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:33,695
<i>Nightmare On</i> <i>Elm Street.</i>

809
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,930
Remake-- still
scary as shit.

810
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:37,765
Karen got ready for work
with the drapes open,

811
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:39,033
which was awesome.

812
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,601
Then she stopped
for some cigarettes

813
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,237
and then she went straight
to work at the movies.

814
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:43,671
Be there till late.

815
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,540
Last show gets out at,
like, 1:00, plus clean-up.

816
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:46,908
Thanks, man.

817
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:50,179
You got Carl following
her around now?

818
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,080
I can't believe you're
still cock-blocking Karen.

819
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,349
She has no cock.

820
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:55,251
- How am I blocking it?
- Let it go, man.

821
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,288
What do you want,

822
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:02,024
huh, you want to marry
her, be with her forever?

823
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,692
Look, I'm just
looking out for her.

824
00:36:03,727 --> 00:36:05,961
- She's my best friend.
- No, I'm your best friend.

825
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:07,395
- She's your fuck buddy.
- No, you're my brother

826
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,130
who should shut the fuck up.

827
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:11,565
Friends usually want
what's best for each other.

828
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,267
This could be
the best thing for Karen.

829
00:36:13,301 --> 00:36:15,268
Oh, so now you know
what's best for everyone?

830
00:36:15,303 --> 00:36:17,136
The kid who wants
to die for a country

831
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:18,604
that thinks he's one
of God's mistakes?

832
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:20,973
The shrink at school says
I'm one of God's mistakes.

833
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,641
The girl has "whore"
tattooed on her arm.

834
00:36:22,676 --> 00:36:24,910
She put my dick in her mouth
'cause you asked her to.

835
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:26,579
- What?!
- You need to shut the fuck up.

836
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:28,914
So, what, you get
her to dump the guy,

837
00:36:28,949 --> 00:36:31,617
stick around for when
Carl gets his first woody

838
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:33,919
so she can work him, too?

839
00:36:33,954 --> 00:36:36,088
I already had my first woody

840
00:36:36,122 --> 00:36:37,390
in history class, talking about

841
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:39,959
how Marie Antoinette's
head got chopped off.

842
00:36:41,328 --> 00:36:43,295
What, are you freebasing
lycopene now,

843
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,498
you worthless piece of shit?

844
00:36:46,533 --> 00:36:49,401
Why you got to be
such an asshole?

845
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:51,436
Apple fell where you dropped it.

846
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:56,408
You think, uh, Karen and
that guy are a done deal?

847
00:36:56,442 --> 00:36:57,775
Who knows?

848
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,744
She's a flighty thing.

849
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:02,847
Actually, kind of reminds
me of your mother--

850
00:37:02,881 --> 00:37:05,183
a beautiful mess.

851
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:09,856
That was smart, coming
in your pajamas already.

852
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,325
These aren't my pajamas.

853
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:13,360
One strawberry and cheese

854
00:37:13,394 --> 00:37:15,529
coffee cake from Weber's.

855
00:37:15,563 --> 00:37:16,830
Thanks. Yum!

856
00:37:16,865 --> 00:37:20,835
I got to get ready for work.
You look gorgeous, party girl.

857
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:23,639
Oh, my, you look lovely.

858
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,173
Thank you.

859
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,176
Dinner was great, mom.

860
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,346
Well, schnitzel is the
same thing as chicken parmesan,

861
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,215
only without the tomato
sauce and cheese.

862
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,850
Did you know that?

863
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:36,185
No.

864
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:37,720
Did you know that, Frank?

865
00:37:37,754 --> 00:37:39,722
Yeah, it's breaded chicken.

866
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,123
Chicken nuggets are
just mini schnitzels.

867
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:42,358
This is the same shit.

868
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:44,694
It really is.

869
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:47,664
I've got to go.

870
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,366
Wait, w-w-wait,
go where, where?

871
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,002
I'm going to Gayle's house
to watch a movie,

872
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,705
and it's only a half a
block from the Alibi,

873
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,908
which means tomorrow
I'll make it there.

874
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:58,176
Let me get this.

875
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,845
Oh, thank you, Frankie.

876
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,847
You know what?

877
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,349
I feel so frisky tonight.

878
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:06,884
- Oh...
- Stay home, stay home.

879
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,019
- Thank you.
- Will ya? Stay home and play with me.

880
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:10,387
- Oh, Frank.
- Come on.

881
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:12,089
- You know what, sweetie?
- Huh?

882
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,858
I am very flattered,
but Gayle--

883
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,360
she's the one that tried to
hang herself that one time,

884
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:20,863
so I really try not
to let her down.

885
00:38:20,897 --> 00:38:22,832
- But I'm flattered.
- Wait.

886
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,835
Do I feel hot to you?
I think I'm getting sick.

887
00:38:25,869 --> 00:38:27,403
Will you stay and make
some soup for me?

888
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,738
You feel fine.

889
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,541
I'll be back
before you know it,

890
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,675
and if you're still
feeling oogie,

891
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,712
I'll make you some ginger tea.

892
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:36,047
Good luck, mom.

893
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,281
Thank you, Jody.

894
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,683
Shit.

895
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,888
You want to play Husker Du?

896
00:38:44,256 --> 00:38:45,623
Don't, d...

897
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:47,792
- Oh, thank God.
- Oh, my God!

898
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,227
Thank God someone is home.

899
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:50,461
Please help me!

900
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:51,729
What happened?

901
00:38:51,764 --> 00:38:53,464
Hey, Frank, call 911!

902
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,866
I was walking down the street
when this bus mirror

903
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:58,702
caught my arm and
just kept going!

904
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,936
Dragged me, like, 50 feet!

905
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:01,471
Where's my arm?!

906
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,739
Frank, put
some pressure on this.

907
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,973
I'm gonna go look for the arm!

908
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,310
How was I?

909
00:39:07,344 --> 00:39:10,880
It was a good performance,
just wrong audience.

910
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:13,917
You eating this?

911
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,986
Knock yourself out.

912
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,062
Thanks, guys.

913
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:25,563
Hey, it's your party.

914
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:27,765
No working. Come on.

915
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:28,967
Got a light?

916
00:39:29,001 --> 00:39:30,936
Yeah.

917
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,337
Thanks for
sticking around tonight.

918
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:35,240
It's for Deb, it's not for you.

919
00:39:35,275 --> 00:39:37,243
Still, thanks. Okay.

920
00:39:39,613 --> 00:39:40,813
- Hey, party girl.
- Hi.

921
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,281
Brought you a couple
of black lights.

922
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,682
Thought it'd set the mood.

923
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:45,317
It makes most people
better looking.

924
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:47,786
Aren't they also good for
finding traces of blood?

925
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,120
Well, my dad used 'em
to snuff out fake bills.

926
00:39:50,155 --> 00:39:51,655
Jesus, that shirt
gets any lower,

927
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:52,790
it'll be underwear.

928
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:53,824
More skin, more skins.

929
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:56,493
Ding dongs!
Awesome!

930
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,161
Carl, those are for guests.

931
00:39:58,195 --> 00:39:59,329
Good, I brought one.

932
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:00,463
Hey, birthday girl.

933
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,665
I'm Little Hank.

934
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,600
Hi. I'm Debbie.

935
00:40:03,634 --> 00:40:05,969
It's not really my birthday.

936
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,772
Good, 'cause I didn't really
bring you a present.

937
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,882
I'm here for the
Gallagher thing.

938
00:40:16,917 --> 00:40:19,886
Really?

939
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,221
You invited Holly Herkimer?

940
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,622
She's, like, 15.

941
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:24,557
You said it could be
anyone from my class.

942
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,459
It's not her fault she's
still in the fourth grade.

943
00:40:26,493 --> 00:40:27,827
Yes. It is.

944
00:40:27,862 --> 00:40:29,863
Yo, still got sparklers
from the fourth.

945
00:40:29,897 --> 00:40:31,798
Make sparkler bombs.

946
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:32,866
Where's the duct tape?

947
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,401
In my kidnap kit in the van.

948
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:36,903
- I'll get it.
- Let's go.

949
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:37,870
You sure you got this?

950
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:39,205
Yeah, no problem.

951
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,809
Okay, have fun.
But not too much fun.

952
00:40:42,843 --> 00:40:45,078
I'm sorry, I got to go.

953
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:47,080
I hope you have a really
great time tonight.

954
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:49,082
Me, too.

955
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:50,517
Okay.

956
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:54,855
Chris! All right!

957
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:56,323
Hey! Hey! Chris!

958
00:40:56,357 --> 00:40:59,393
Stop! Chris! Stop!

959
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,336
Can I get you another
slice of pizza, Hank?

960
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,870
Little Hank.

961
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:13,039
Hank's my old man;
He's an asshole.

962
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,240
My dad, too.

963
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,117
What are you doing?

964
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,052
Just wanted to see what
your hair smelled like.

965
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,787
Thought it would smell
like flowers and shit,

966
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:31,022
but it's cigarettes
and coconuts.

967
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,790
Still totally hot.

968
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:36,427
I've already seen this movie,
and this pizza sucks.

969
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,962
Sorry. Can I make you
a grilled cheese?

970
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,396
You can make me one.

971
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:41,732
Where's Lip?

972
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,802
God, you're so fucking hot.

973
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,103
This is amazing.

974
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:48,738
Flattery will get
you everywhere.

975
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,143
Shh. I don't want
Ian to hear us.

976
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,745
He won't.

977
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,638
I bet you could get
any guy into bed, huh?

978
00:42:20,673 --> 00:42:24,508
Yeah. Why?

979
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,917
Karen home?

980
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:36,752
At work, pulling a double.

981
00:42:38,555 --> 00:42:40,122
Mind if I wait?

982
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:55,305
♪ I almost lost you ♪

983
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,310
♪ now you're back ♪

984
00:42:59,344 --> 00:43:02,313
♪ your beautiful smile ♪

985
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,420
It's Steve. Leave some words.

986
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:14,791
Caw-caw!

987
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,859
Hey, I bet you're
wondering where I've been.

988
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,494
Not really.

989
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:20,295
- China. Putting together a deal.
- Oh!

990
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:22,030
Anybody pee in your coke?

991
00:43:22,065 --> 00:43:23,031
Ooh.

992
00:43:23,066 --> 00:43:24,400
Is that an offer?

993
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,202
Oh, I'd love to, but
I got to get home.

994
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:27,403
Oh, come on, I'll drive you.

995
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,504
Such a gentleman.

996
00:43:28,538 --> 00:43:30,573
Uh-uh. Ulterior motive.

997
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:32,675
I figure this way,
maybe I get an offer

998
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:34,310
to come inside for a nightcap.

999
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:35,578
I think you've had enough.

1000
00:43:35,612 --> 00:43:36,880
How about I drive you?

1001
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,185
- Right.
- Yeah, all right, okay.

1002
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,887
Now, this is a big
first step, all right?

1003
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,022
I don't let anybody drive her.

1004
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,323
Not even Valets.

1005
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:47,391
Oh, that's smart.

1006
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:48,860
I hear they steal cars.

1007
00:43:48,894 --> 00:43:50,662
Yeah, okay.
Easy, easy, easy.

1008
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,598
Relax. I know how
to work a stick.

1009
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:54,600
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

1010
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:55,869
All right.

1011
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:17,290
Psst.

1012
00:44:17,325 --> 00:44:19,092
I got duct tape if you want.

1013
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,427
We could put her in the van.

1014
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:27,533
Want to see how fast
I can unhook your bra?

1015
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,201
I don't wear a bra, runt.

1016
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:31,436
Move, I have to pee.

1017
00:44:32,638 --> 00:44:33,871
Ow!

1018
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:35,072
Ow.

1019
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,489
My God, woman, you work fast.

1020
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:53,492
True. I've done
some of my best work

1021
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,327
- on a hall pass.
- What the...

1022
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:57,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Holly!

1023
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,631
I won't tell.

1024
00:44:58,665 --> 00:45:00,800
Fuck! Get out now!

1025
00:45:00,834 --> 00:45:02,969
Holly, out! No!

1026
00:45:13,513 --> 00:45:14,813
- Ow!
- Ow!

1027
00:45:14,847 --> 00:45:16,815
- What the...
- What's going on?

1028
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:17,916
Lip's an asshole.
I'm out of here.

1029
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,750
What'd he do?

1030
00:45:18,785 --> 00:45:20,185
Want me to kick his ass?

1031
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,654
- I'm making waffles for breakfast.
- Yeah?

1032
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,489
Well, you can shove
mine up Lip's ass.

1033
00:45:24,523 --> 00:45:26,925
- Aha!
- Easy, easy, easy.

1034
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:27,959
That was good.

1035
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:31,363
The Fast And The Furious, huh?

1036
00:45:31,397 --> 00:45:33,966
- Thanks for the ride.
- Mm-hmm.

1037
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,033
Oh.

1038
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:36,368
Sorry for throwing up.

1039
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:39,804
Holly?

1040
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,539
Carl, what happened?

1041
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:42,774
I don't know.

1042
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:44,809
Jesus.

1043
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:46,344
What is going on?!

1044
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:48,112
Holly left my party
in the middle of the night

1045
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:49,314
because of something Lip did.

1046
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:50,849
- You didn't.
- No, I didn't.

1047
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,851
All right, I blew her off,
and she split.

1048
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:55,388
You could've just done her so
my party wouldn't have sucked!

1049
00:45:55,422 --> 00:45:56,389
Deb, she's 14!

1050
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:57,557
Which one's Holly?

1051
00:45:57,591 --> 00:45:59,225
She left!

1052
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,827
And then Little Hank left, too.

1053
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:06,699
Deb, I'm sure the rest
of the party was awesome.

1054
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:08,734
How would you know?

1055
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,836
You weren't here.

1056
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:12,138
You Craig?

1057
00:46:12,172 --> 00:46:14,306
- Who?
- No.

1058
00:46:14,341 --> 00:46:16,508
Hey, you want to open
my present now?

1059
00:46:16,543 --> 00:46:19,544
No, Simon. I don't really
give a shit about your present.

1060
00:46:19,578 --> 00:46:21,012
Great job chaperoning.

1061
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:22,547
What the hell would
you have had me done,

1062
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:24,416
sleep with the kid?

1063
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:26,919
This is my worst birthday ever.

1064
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:29,322
Deb, let me make it up to you.

1065
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,259
Okay? How about I take you
to an R-rated movie sometime?

1066
00:46:32,293 --> 00:46:34,194
Little Hank, too?

1067
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,166
He's not gonna go with just me.

1068
00:46:39,201 --> 00:46:40,701
Can Holly come, too?

1069
00:46:40,736 --> 00:46:42,770
Fine.

1070
00:46:42,804 --> 00:46:44,071
A double date.

1071
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:45,739
No. Just me buying...

1072
00:46:45,773 --> 00:46:48,107
Escorting.

1073
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,543
Deal.

1074
00:46:54,648 --> 00:46:56,115
I should, um,

1075
00:46:56,149 --> 00:46:57,783
I should probably
brush my teeth

1076
00:46:57,817 --> 00:46:59,618
before we make out or anything.

1077
00:46:59,652 --> 00:47:01,186
Sleep it off on the couch.

1078
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:02,720
No. Hey, I-I can drive.

1079
00:47:02,755 --> 00:47:04,756
No, you can't.

1080
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,758
I'll see you in the morning.

1081
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,765
Hey, do you think my car
will still be there?

1082
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,801
Parts of it.

1083
00:47:25,979 --> 00:47:27,780
Jesus Chr-- that's--

1084
00:47:27,814 --> 00:47:29,248
don't do that.

1085
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:31,417
Top of the morning.

1086
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:33,419
Let's go to the Alibi!

1087
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:34,887
Come on. I want to meet

1088
00:47:34,921 --> 00:47:36,288
- all your co-workers.
- I don't--

1089
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:37,722
my shift doesn't start
until noon.

1090
00:47:37,756 --> 00:47:38,957
Oh.

1091
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:42,126
Okay.

1092
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:46,664
You know what they say.

1093
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:50,501
"The early bird
catches the worm."

1094
00:47:50,536 --> 00:47:51,836
I caught it.

1095
00:47:55,507 --> 00:47:57,641
Oh, Jesus! Is that your fist?

1096
00:47:57,675 --> 00:48:00,244
No, it's my foot.

1097
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,812
No, no, no, no, no, no,

1098
00:48:01,847 --> 00:48:02,813
no, no, no, no.

1099
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:04,615
You said no toys.

1100
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,084
Ooh, I can wiggle my toes.

1101
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,821
This little piggy
went to market.

1102
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,089
Ah!

1103
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,194
And this little
piggy stayed home.

1104
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,496
Okay, that's
two piggies, right?

1105
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:21,864
This little piggy...

1106
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,534
...Had roast beef.

1107
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:26,669
And this little piggy had none.

1108
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:27,803
Oh, God.

1109
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:28,805
But this little piggy...

1110
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:30,139
No, no, no, no.

1111
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,807
Not all the way home.
Not all the way home.

1112
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:32,808
...He went all
the way home.

1113
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:34,176
Oh!

1114
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,045
Whoo!

1115
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,052
Carl!

1116
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,720
Knock it off!

1117
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,029
Yeah, throw it.

1118
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:55,330
Throw it, let me play baseball.

1119
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,336
I'm sorry I had to miss
your party.

1120
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,308
So, tell me about Hank.

1121
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:08,744
He's cute, isn't he?

1122
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:13,249
Hey, uh, you got any coffee?

1123
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,485
Hi. Uh, I'm Adam.

1124
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,087
You married?

1125
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,094
Oh, just hit me with
the bat already.

1126
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,763
I don't have time for this.

1127
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,398
Wasn't my idea to come
to an adulterer's house.

1128
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:31,201
It was mine.

1129
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:33,069
Well, actually, our priest.

1130
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,172
He thinks we can put
this whole thing behind us,

1131
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:36,907
but we just need your help.

1132
00:49:36,942 --> 00:49:38,275
My help?

1133
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,777
Who the hell is this?

1134
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,045
Hi. I-I'm Adam.

1135
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,448
Just go and do
what you came here to do.

1136
00:49:47,386 --> 00:49:52,222
I am asking both of you

1137
00:49:52,257 --> 00:49:53,624
for your forgiveness.

1138
00:49:53,658 --> 00:49:55,692
I forgive you.

1139
00:49:55,727 --> 00:49:57,127
We done now?

1140
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,628
Do you forgive me?

1141
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,264
I want to.

1142
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,432
I really do.

1143
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:04,601
But every time
I start to picture it,

1144
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,969
I just want
to rip your head off

1145
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:07,538
and I want to shit
down your neck.

1146
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:10,140
Okay. What I hear you saying...

1147
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,943
Is that you want to forgive me,

1148
00:50:12,977 --> 00:50:14,478
you just need
a little bit more time.

1149
00:50:29,094 --> 00:50:31,229
- So fuck father Nichols.
- Lucy-jo, come on now...

1150
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:49,682
Come on!

1151
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:51,116
Kev's, like, a giant.

1152
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,618
- That's not fair.
- Life's not fair, Debs.

1153
00:50:52,652 --> 00:50:54,687
- Haven't you learned that by now?
- All right, bring her down!

1154
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,423
Come on, little girl,
you're going down!

1155
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,759
I don't play! I don't play!

1156
00:51:01,662 --> 00:51:03,663
- Looks like your rash is clearing up.
- Yeah.

1157
00:51:03,698 --> 00:51:06,167
You guys done
with your therapy?

1158
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:07,535
They're still in the house.

1159
00:51:07,569 --> 00:51:09,203
He's singing
"Your Body Is A Wonderland."

1160
00:51:09,237 --> 00:51:10,204
Hmm.

1161
00:51:10,238 --> 00:51:11,539
Who's this?

1162
00:51:11,573 --> 00:51:12,807
Oh. Kevin, Adam.

1163
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:14,141
- Adam, Kevin.
- How you doing, man?

1164
00:51:14,176 --> 00:51:15,643
Nice to meet you.
Oh, sorry, bro.

1165
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:17,311
Welcome.

1166
00:51:17,346 --> 00:51:20,481
Hey, you okay?

1167
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:22,850
Why the fuck

1168
00:51:22,884 --> 00:51:25,853
was Mandy Milkovich at my
house trying to screw Jody?!

1169
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:28,655
He turned her down
and told me what happened!

1170
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,390
Yeah, 'cause he's
a fucking pussy.

1171
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:32,892
- Fuck you!
- Okay! Hey!

1172
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:35,695
Stay the fuck away from me!
Stay the fuck away from Jody!

1173
00:51:35,729 --> 00:51:39,666
And stay the fuck away
from this baby!
