00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,510
你不是個真正的律師

當然
Absolutely.

I just, um

85

聽著  是這樣
Listen, here's the thing.

86
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:41,577
如果我接受這份工作  是否意味著我倆...
If I take this job, does that mean the two of us...

87
00:07:42,257 --> 00:07:44,287
我是說...
I mean, uh...

88
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,947
是否意味著...
Does it mean, uh...

89
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:48,637
什么  你到底想說什么
What? What -- what the hell is this?

90
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:52,327
如果我今天接受戴維斯梅因律所的工作
If I take this job today, with Davis and Main,

91
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:55,107
是否意味著你和我...
does that mean that you and me...

92
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:59,387
能成嗎
Is this -- is this gonna happen?

93
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,987

我...
I...

95
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:20,347
這兩件事沒有任何聯系
One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.

96
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:22,637
完全無關嗎
Nothing at all.

97
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,247
無關
No.

98
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:25,867
當然無關了  為什么會有呢
Of course not. Why would it?

99
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:28,677
好吧
Great.

100
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:34,327
非常抱歉
Oh, sorry about that.

101
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,407
我想說  衷心感謝你們
Listen, I just wanted to say thank you sincerely

102
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:38,597
考慮我
for your interest in me.

103
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,407
這是我的榮幸
It's a honor to be considered,

104
00:08:40,407 --> 00:08:43,307
但是現在  尤其是現在
but at this time...at this time,

105
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:46,357
我想我還是不加入了
Um...I'm gonna have to take myself out of the running.

106
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:47,577
非常感謝
Thanks.

107
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,027

不收費
No charge.

111
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,517
幫我想想
Help me out here.

112
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:02,177
我是在做夢
Did I dream it?

113
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:07,327
還是我辦公桌上真的有一百六十萬美元現金
Or did I had 1.6 million dollars on my desk in cash?

114
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,447
地球上沒人知道我們有這錢
No one on god's green earth knew we had it.

115
00:09:10,447 --> 00:09:12,137
我們可以五五分成
We could have split it 50/50.

116
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:17,497
我們本可以每人帶八十萬美金回家  不用交稅
We could have gone home with $800,000 each, tax-free.

117
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:19,717
你想說什么
Your point being?

118
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:21,737
我們為什么沒那么干
Why didn't we?

119
00:09:22,057 --> 00:09:25,607
我記得你說  要做對的事
I remember you saying something about doing the right thing.

120
00:09:25,717 --> 00:09:27,727
你想知道我為什么沒拿那錢嗎
You want to know why I didn't take that money?

121
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:29,327
你是在問這個嗎
Is that what you're asking?

122
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,707
沒錯  我是想問那個問題
Yeah, that's what I'm asking.

123
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:34,847
對我個人來說  別人雇我干活
Me, personally -- I was hired to do a job.

124
00:09:35,047 --> 00:09:38,137
我干完了  就結束了
I did it. That's as far as it goes.

125
00:09:37,807 --> 00:10:17,927


126
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:39,317
是的
Yeah.

127
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:42,157
我知道是什么阻止了我
Well, I know what stopped me.

128
00:09:42,537 --> 00:09:43,737
聽好了
You know what?

129
00:09:44,107 --> 00:09:46,217

It's never stopping me again.

為什么
Why?

152
00:12:23,507 --> 00:12:25,817
這樁生意要求克制
This business requires restraint.

153
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:29,117
但這車恰恰相反
That is the opposite of restraint.

154

但是我喜歡它
But...I like it.

155
00:12:32,797 --> 00:12:34,247
我是說  我為它自豪
I mean, I'm proud of it.

156
00:12:34,257 --> 00:12:34,917
好的
Good.

157
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,547
那你一個人自豪去  別拉著我
Then you be proud of it on your own time, but not with me.

158
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,297
我拒絕上車
I'm not getting in that.

159
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,697
好吧  那  那就別上車了
Okay. Then -- then don't.

160
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:49,517
實話說  你也沒干什么
Honestly, uh, you don't really do anything.

161
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:52,227
你只是站在我背后而已
I've been paying you the salary of three people

162
00:12:52,227 --> 00:12:54,147
我就要付你三人份的報酬
to just stand behind me.

163
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,557
而且  而且最近幾次交易
You know? And -- and these-- these last few deals --

164
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:59,077
這個叫納喬的  他都是一個人來的
This Nacho fella, he's been coming alone.

165
00:12:59,257 --> 00:13:00,847
如果他不需要帶人
I mean, if he doesn't need backup men,

166
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:03,637
那我為什么要帶你呢
then, I mean, why do I need you?

167
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:05,727
我應該一個人去
I should just go alone.

168
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:07,917
不然我就浪費錢了
I'm throwing -- I'm throwing away money.

169
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:11,077
跟扔垃圾堆里一樣
Just tossing it away. Into the trash.

170
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:14,017
隨你怎么辦
Look, you do whatever you want,

171
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,327
但是我建議你  如果沒有人跟著你
but I'm advising you -- do not go to that meet

172
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:18,417
別一個人去
without someone watching your back.

173
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,027
是啊  你當然會這么說了
Yeah, well, of course you're gonna say that.

174
00:13:21,027 --> 00:13:23,787
你才不想失去這份輕松賺大錢的工作
I mean, you don't want to be out of this easy-peasy job.

175
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:27,237
不過抱歉  這個肥差
Well, I'm sorry, but this is the gravy train,

176
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:29,927
馬上就要溜走了
and it's leaving the station right now.

177
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:32,347
所以最后一次機會
So last chance.

178
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:34,947
上車
All aboard.

179
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,347

Seriously, last chance.

去紀念品商店買件泳衣

這里是印錯了嗎
Uh, is that a misprint right there?

257
00:18:51,621 --> 00:18:52,741
一定是印錯了
It's got to be, right?

258
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:53,971
-陳年藍寶石嗎  -是的

沒印錯  真的

老天爺  一杯龍舌蘭要五十美金嗎

不過也看個人喜好了
I mean, it's kind of a personal-choice kind of thing.

263
00:19:03,701 --> 00:19:06,501
這輩子一定得嘗嘗五十美金的龍舌蘭
Well, I can't die without trying a $50 shot of tequila,

264
00:19:06,501 --> 00:19:08,991

吉米  在西塞羅市發生了什么
Jimmy... did something happen in Cicero?

275
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,611
為什么西塞羅市一定要有事發生
Why did something have to happen in Cicero?

276
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,731
因為我跟你說戴維斯梅因律所時
Because when I talked to you about Davis & Main,

277
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:43,011
你都準備好接受那份工作
you were ready to take the job.

278
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:45,781
現在你回來了  突然要放棄法律工作
Now you're back, and you're suddenly quitting the law,

279
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,051
在酒店騙喝昂貴的酒
cheating hotels out of expensive liquor,

280
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:50,511
帶一個奇怪的尾戒
wearing a weird pinkie ring?

281
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,041
怎么  加入黑手黨了嗎
What, are you in the mafia now?

還問我們有沒有未來
Asking if we have a future.

00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:01,001
到底怎么回事
I mean, where did that come from?

284
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:03,381
我不知道  只是
I don't know. I just...

285
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,871
西塞羅跟這沒關系
Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.

286
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,311
是我的人生
It's my whole life.

287
00:20:09,321 --> 00:20:13,151
從查克讓我來到阿爾布開克開始
Well, my life since Chuck made me come to Albuquerque.

288
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:14,621
自從我來到這兒
Ever since I got here,

289
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:17,321
我所做的一切都是為了讓查克高興
all I've done is try to make Chuck happy,

290
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:20,031
使出渾身解數來討好查克
bend over backwards to please Chuck.

291
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:23,651
查克  查克  查克  再也不這樣了
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck. Well, no more.

292
00:20:24,081 --> 00:20:26,761
你放棄從事法律  這不正是查克想要的
You quitting the law -- isn't that exactly what Chuck wants?

293
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:28,131
誰在乎呢
Who cares?

294
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,351
這是為了我自己  好嗎
This is for me, okay?

295
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:32,931
因為各種錯誤的原因  我開始從事法律
I-I got into the law for all the wrong reasons.

296
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,781
我相信自己的直覺
I'm trusting my instincts.

297
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:38,211
我的才華還是發揮在別處比較好
I think that my talents are better spent elsewhere.

298
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:40,811
在哪兒  漂在別人的泳池里嗎
Where? Floating in somebody else's pool?

299
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:45,601
吉米  你是個了不起的律師
Jimmy, you're a great lawyer.

300
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:46,951
為什么要放棄
Why give that up?

301
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:49,631
也不是說我不享受做律師
I'm not saying it didn't have its moments,

302
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:50,901
只是我所喜歡的事
but the stuff I liked about it --

303
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,811
說服別人  讓別人信服
selling people, convincing people --

304
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,341
不當律師也可以做到
I don't have to be a lawyer to do that.

305
00:20:55,501 --> 00:20:58,471
還有  我知道別人怎么看我
Besides, people tell me how they see me,

306
00:20:58,471 --> 00:20:59,941
他們并不把我當律師
and it's not as a lawyer.

307
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:03,031
這是您要的酒
All right. Here you go.

308
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:03,891
謝謝
Thank you.

309
00:21:04,201 --> 00:21:06,221
還需要什么隨時叫我
Lemme know if I can get you guys anything else, okay?

310
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,271
波比  怎么樣  伙計
Bobby, what up, brother man?

311
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:09,201
謝謝
Oh, thanks.

312
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,361
做空
Short it.

313
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,401
做空
Short it.

314
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:16,131
做空  把那垃圾做空
Short it. Short that shit.

315
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:18,211
那支股毫無價值  沒有前途
That stock is useless. It's got no legs.

316
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:20,161
就像馬戲團的怪咖  但毫無樂趣
It's like a circus freak minus the fun.

317
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:22,091
那支更糟糕  誰跟你推薦的
And that one's even worse. Who's giving you these?

318
00:21:22,461 --> 00:21:23,881
幫我一個忙  拿個枕頭
Please do me a favor. Take a pillow,

319
00:21:23,891 --> 00:21:25,921
放在那支股票的臉上
put it over that stock's face

320
00:21:26,031 --> 00:21:27,401
直到你聽到垂死呻吟
until you hear the deathbed queef.

321
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:28,881
-是個賠錢貨  -好吧
- It's a loser. - Okay, so...

322
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,491
如果你不做律師  要做什么
if you're not gonna be a lawyer, then what?

323
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:35,051
漂著等磯鷂渡的錢到手嗎
Float around and wait for your Sandpiper money to roll in?

324
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,871
-不  -那可能要好幾年
- No. - That could take years.

325
00:21:36,871 --> 00:21:39,081
磯鷂渡跟這沒關系
Sandpiper has no bearing on this at all.

326
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,381
這個有前途
Yeah, it's got legs.

327
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,691
那好  有什么計劃
Okay, then, what's the plan?

328
00:21:43,871 --> 00:21:45,221
用開放的心態迎接未來
To be open to the universe.

329
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,441
那就是沒計劃
Okay, so no plan.

330
00:21:46,561 --> 00:21:47,901
隨心所欲
Just walk the Earth,

331
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,701
像《低俗小說》結尾的朱爾那樣嗎
like Jules at the end of "Pulp Fiction"?

332
00:21:49,701 --> 00:21:52,221
無論未來給我什么
Look, whatever the universe presents,

333
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:55,561
無論有什么樣的機會  我都會接受
whatever opportunity arises, I will take it.

334
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:56,711
-無論什么樣的機會嗎  -是的
- Whatever opportunity? - Yeah.

335
00:21:56,711 --> 00:21:58,831
戴維斯梅因律所不是一個機會嗎
Wasn't Davis & Main an opportunity?

336
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:01,971
是非常好的機遇  但你放棄了
It's a great opportunity, and you're walking away from it.

337
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,601
不是他  不是那個人...
Not him, not the guy who...

338
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:08,211
拒絕前難道不該至少試一下這份工作嗎
Look, shouldn't you at least try the job before you say no?

339
00:22:08,431 --> 00:22:10,421
浪費所有人  包括我自己的時間
And waste everyone's time, including my own?

340
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:13,651
金  謝謝你的關心  但那不適合我
Kim, I appreciate your concern, but it's not for me.

341
00:22:13,651 --> 00:22:14,701
我不想要
I don't want it.

342
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:18,081
吉米  你記得你為司法考試學了多久
Jimmy, do you remember how long you studied for that bar?

343
00:22:18,091 --> 00:22:19,501
你有多用功
How hard you worked?

344
00:22:19,861 --> 00:22:22,421
所有努力都付之一炬嗎
All that effort, you're just gonna toss it away?

345
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:24,771
這是沉沒成本謬誤
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy.

346
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,971
{an3}{pos(374,227)}認為已經花了很多時間  金錢和精力的事就應該繼續下去

347
00:22:25,171 --> 00:22:25,971

W-- The what?

348
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:29,331
沉沒成本謬誤  是賭徒行為
The Fallacy of Sunk Cost -- it's what gamblers do.

349
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:31,071
賠了夫人又折兵
They throw good money after bad

350
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:33,041
以為自己運氣好  能回本
thinking they can turn their luck around.

351
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,861
我已經花了這么多錢和時間
It's like, "I've already spent this much money or time --

352
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,961
無論怎樣我都得繼續
whatever, I got to keep going!"

353
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,471
但游戲最后是沒有回報的
No, there's no reward at the end of this game.

354
00:22:40,471 --> 00:22:42,181
你錯了
You are making a mistake.

355
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:44,681
我知道你錯了
I know you're making a mistake.

356
00:22:44,681 --> 00:22:46,981
我這些年一直在做所謂正確的事
I've been doing the "right" thing for all these years now,

357
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:48,991
但我落得什么下場  糟透了
and where has it gotten me? Nowhere.

358
00:22:48,991 --> 00:22:50,421
抱歉  我不...
I'm sorry. I don't...

359
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:56,201
我沒點
It's not my thing.

360
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:57,721
我不懂
I don't get it.

361
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,601
-我就是不懂  -這才是對的事
- I just don't get it. - It's what's right for me.

362
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:02,811
扯淡
Donkey balls.

363
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:04,781
純粹扯淡  伙計
Pure donkey balls, dude.

364
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:05,891
華爾街是廢柴待的地方
Wall Street's for suckers.

365
00:23:05,891 --> 00:23:07,411
誰吃飽了撐的想去那兒啊
Who needs that aggravation?

366
00:23:07,651 --> 00:23:08,801
如果股神巴菲特不非得待在那兒
If the the Oracle doesn't have to live there,

367
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,261
那我肯定不去
then I sure as hell don't.

368
00:23:10,651 --> 00:23:12,661
我坐馬桶上  用手提電腦就能交易
I can make a million-dollar stock trade on my laptop

369
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:13,881
一百萬美元的股票

就像麥德斯往我王座上拉金磚
Like Midas, shitting gold bricks on my throne.

372
00:23:16,891 --> 00:23:18,691
所以斯皮爾格曼和戴伊奇才這么想要我的生意
That's why Speigelman and Deitch want my business so bad.

373

我是大金主
I'm a golden God.

我當然記得  誰會忘記那種事
Look, of course I remember that. Who forgets a thing like that?

那種屁話是被壓抑的弱勢群體的憤怒

但我不小心聽到了
but I kind of was.

389
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,351
我們聽到你說股票的事
Uh, we heard you talking about stocks.

390
00:24:06,491 --> 00:24:07,571
那么問題來了
Yeah, so, question --

391
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,091
你能不能解決我和我妹妹的爭論
if you could settle a debate between me and my sister.

392
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,551
算了吧  我們不該打擾這位...
Uh, you know what? We probably shouldn't be bothering this --

393
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:14,771
我們一般不麻煩別人  是吧
We wouldn't normally do this -- right?

394
00:24:14,771 --> 00:24:16,041
但我們需要一個專家
But we need an expert.

395
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,091
他聽起來好像很懂行
This guy sounds like he knows his stuff.

396

沒錯  你說
Yeah, go.

397
00:24:21,371 --> 00:24:23,121
行  問題是這樣的
Okay. Here's the question.

398
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:25,121
在股票市場中
Uh, when it comes to the stock market,

399
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:26,911
允許個人投資的數額
is there, like, a financial limit

400
00:24:26,911 --> 00:24:29,561
有沒有限制
to how much a person's allowed to invest?

401
00:24:30,641 --> 00:24:31,601
限制
A limit?

402
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,851
沒  沒限制
No. No limit.

403
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:37,581
我就知道  那如果是遺產呢
Knew it. Oh, even if it's an inheritance?

404
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:39,961
比如  要交遺產稅之類的
You know, with, like, inheritance taxes and whatnot?

405
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,201
同樣沒有
Nope. Same.

406
00:24:41,201 --> 00:24:43,801
太棒了  謝謝  伙計
That's -- oh, fantastic. Thank you, buddy.

407
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,981
聽到沒  沒限制  跟你說了我們能全投進去
See? No limit. Told you we could invest it all.

408
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,761
而且這也是明智之舉
And it's a smart move, too.

409
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:51,251
全存銀行里  不行
Sticking it all in the bank? No.

410
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:53,881
沒錯  你可以投資所有的錢
Yeah. You can... invest all your money.

411
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:55,881
但確保要分散投資
Just make sure you diversify.

412
00:24:55,881 --> 00:24:58,161
沒錯  分散投資
Yeah. Diversify.

413
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,371
那...  你得...
That's -- You got to --

414
00:25:00,371 --> 00:25:03,471
你說的"分散投資"是什么意思
Oh, hey, um... what do you mean, "diversify"?

415
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:05,371
分散投資就是
Well, diversify is --

416
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,531
你聽過一句名言
Y-you know that saying,

417
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:08,821
"雞蛋別全放在一個籃子里"  是吧
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket," right?

418
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:09,931
一個道理
Same principle.

419
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,201
沒錯  完全說得通  謝謝
No, it makes complete sense. Thank you.

420
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:13,631
如果你能告訴你要投多少錢
Now, if I had an idea of the money we're talking about --

421
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:17,261
大致數目  我可以教你精明地分散投資
ballpark -- I could give you examples of smart diversification.

422
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:19,961
好吧...
Yeah, um...

00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:25,261

Look, an uncle on our father's side recently passed,

424
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:31,351
給我們留下了大約一百四十萬的遺產
and he left us somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.4 million.

425
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:33,501
不是我這人貪心  但我覺得
And I don't mean to be greedy, but I think,

426
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:35,391
如果我們現在明智地投資
if we invest it smart now,

427
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:37,541
我們可以將它翻兩倍  三倍
we could double it, triple it --

428
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:40,511
甚至可以將這筆錢翻四倍  對嗎
we could quadruple the whole inheritance, right?

429
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,091
在我看來
In my opinion?

430
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:44,641
財富屬于有膽量的人  兄弟
Fortune favors the bold, man.

Now, if you guys are free to join me for a drink,

我可以給你們簡單參謀一下
I can give you a quick consult.

433
00:25:48,551 --> 00:25:50,001
沒關系  我們自己能行
That's all right. We were gonna do it ourselves

434
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:51,981
用那種在線經紀網站就行
through one of those online brokerage websites.

435
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:54,641
我們打算選個經典點的  比如...
We're just gonna pick, uh, a classic, like --

對  對  你們自己完全沒問題
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can totally do it yourself.

438
00:25:58,621 --> 00:26:00,001
就挑那些可靠的
Shoot for the tried and true.

439
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,181

00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,648
他們怎么進來的
How'd they get in?

599
00:34:23,888 --> 00:34:25,988
那邊的后門
Uh, the back door over here.

600
00:34:26,628 --> 00:34:28,768
我回家吃午飯的時候發現它開著
It was open when I came home for lunch.

601
00:34:28,768 --> 00:34:30,108
本來是鎖上的
I mean, it was locked,

602
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:33,108
他們肯定是撬了鎖還怎么的
but they must have jimmied it open or something.

603
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,738
你覺得大概是什么時候的事
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?

604
00:34:36,738 --> 00:34:39,918
我8點15分去上班  12點半回家吃午飯
I left for work at 8:15, came home for lunch at 12:30,

605
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,268
然后立馬就報警了
and called you immediately.

606
00:34:41,268 --> 00:34:42,658
有沒有丟失其他物品
Was anything else taken?

607
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:45,138
現金  不少現金
Cash -- a fair bit. Uh, um...

608
00:34:45,138 --> 00:34:46,188
有多少
How much cash?

609
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:48,028
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

610
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:51,048
先關注最重要的東西好嗎
You know, let's focus on what's important here, you know?

611
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,638
我只關心我的棒球卡
All I really care about are my baseball cards.

612
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:56,358
我有一張托普斯家的米奇·曼托新秀卡
You know, I have a Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card

613
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:58,038
那是獨一無二的
that's irreplaceable.

614
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,128
那是鑄幣級的
It's a mint,

615
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:01,048
定位比例正面為60/40  反面為90/10
60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.

616
00:35:01,048 --> 00:35:02,128
我可以列舉出很多特色
I can go on.

617
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:03,818
我所有的卡片都是小心存儲的
All my cards are in top-loaders,

618
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,898
如果把它們拿出來風吹日曬的
but if they're taken out and exposed to the elements,

619
00:35:06,908 --> 00:35:09,428
或者是彎折了  天吶可千萬別
I mean, or creased, God forbid,

620
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:13,118
短短幾秒鐘  就會貶值一大截
I mean, you're looking at a 9-point downgrade in a matter of seconds.

621
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,948
我知道像這樣的案子
I understand the first 48 hours

622
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,748
案發后四十八小時是破案的黃金時期
are the most important in investigations like this,

623
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:19,568
時間過去越久
so the more time passes,

624
00:35:19,568 --> 00:35:22,208
找到失物的可能性就越小
I mean, the less likely we are of a recovery.

625
00:35:22,428 --> 00:35:26,808
所以  時間寶貴啊  兄弟們
So...time is of the essence here, guys.

626
00:35:26,808 --> 00:35:29,688
我們會盡全力幫助你的  沃莫爾德先生
Well, we're gonna help you out the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

627
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:30,698
很好
Good.

628
00:35:32,468 --> 00:35:34,368
他們還真是把這地方翻了個底朝天
They really tossed this place.

629
00:35:34,878 --> 00:35:37,058
你確定他們不是在找其他東西嗎
I mean, are you sure they weren't looking for anything else?

630
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,288
比如說
Like what?

631
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:42,068
我不知道  只是問問你的想法
I don't know. J-Just wondering your thoughts.

632
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,388
我猜他們想找更多的棒球卡吧
I assume more baseball cards.

633
00:35:44,388 --> 00:35:45,598
除了鎖在那個盒子里的那些
Did you have more baseball cards

634
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,038
你還有其他棒球卡嗎
than the ones you keep locked in that case here?

635
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:48,818
有  在后面  好幾千張呢
Yes, in -- in back -- thousands.

636
00:35:48,818 --> 00:35:52,178
但是這些才是極品
But these were the crown jewels over here.

637
00:35:52,178 --> 00:35:54,058
全明星陣容
You know, t-the all-star lineup.

638
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:55,538
好吧
Right.

639
00:35:59,918 --> 00:36:00,768
怎么了
What?

640
00:36:00,768 --> 00:36:02,228
我只是想理清一下狀況
Just trying to make sense of it.

641
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:04,518
有什么好理的  不就是
What's to make sense of? I mean, isn't it as simple

642
00:36:04,518 --> 00:36:07,328
小偷來偷棒球卡嗎  多簡單
as the perp was looking for more baseball cards?

643
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,708
或者是嗑藥嗑嗨了
Or hopped up on speed or whatever

644
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:12,278
瘋了一樣來這掃蕩一通
and went nuts with the vandalism?

645
00:36:12,288 --> 00:36:14,008
是啊  也有可能
Yeah. I mean, that could be.

646
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:18,628
外面那輛悍馬挺酷的
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.

647
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:19,898
是你的嗎
That yours?

648
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,528
對  是我的
Yeah, that's mine.

649
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:23,158
租來的
Uh, it's a lease.

650
00:36:24,218 --> 00:36:25,618
價錢特別劃算
Got a great deal on it.

651
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,038
真酷
It's very sweet.

652
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,968
你知道嗎  他們說悍馬
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger

653
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:33,248
就是為了阿諾德·斯瓦辛格而生的
is the reason that Hummers exist.

654
00:36:33,248 --> 00:36:35,298
我也不知道為什么  他們就這么說的
I don't know how, but that's what they say.

655
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:36,498
真的啊
No kidding.

656
00:36:38,578 --> 00:36:40,818
你是做什么工作的  沃莫爾德先生
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?

657
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,438
我是搞IT的
Uh, I work I.T.,

658
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,678
在一家制藥公司上班
uh, for a pharmaceutical company.

659
00:36:45,678 --> 00:36:48,078
哇  搗鼓電腦的
Wow. Computers.

660
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,108
天哪  我就該學計算機的
God, I should've gotten into computers.

661
00:36:50,548 --> 00:36:52,298
-那我也能開那樣的悍馬了  -沒錯
- I'd have that same Hummer. - Yeah, right.

662
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:54,608
兄弟們  我很高興你們喜歡我的車
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car,

663
00:36:54,608 --> 00:36:56,438
但我覺得我們現在
but I think we're looking through

664
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:58,558
重點錯了吧
the wrong end of the telescope here.

665
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:01,948
最重要的是要找到我的棒球卡
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.

666
00:37:01,948 --> 00:37:03,028
當然
Of course.

667
00:37:03,048 --> 00:37:07,808
好的  我把我的所有藏品列了一份詳細的清單
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest of my entire collection

668
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:11,298
高價的卡片旁邊標了星號
and asterisks next to the high-ticket items,

669
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:14,008
所以很容易就能看出來他們會最先出手哪些
so it's clear which ones they're gonna try to fence first,

670
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:16,068
因為這些超級超級值錢
'cause they're super, super valuable.

671
00:37:16,158 --> 00:37:19,528
你們需要拿著這份清單去找典當行
So you're gonna want to get this list out to pawnshops,

672
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,728
收藏愛好者  查問所有
uh, collectors, question anyone who's done

673
00:37:22,728 --> 00:37:24,768
有類似前科的人
any sort of crime like this in the past.

674
00:37:24,768 --> 00:37:27,238
那些按常理來說有嫌疑的人
You know, the -- the usual suspects.

675
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:30,418
我能把名單給你們  好讓你們開始調查嗎
Uh, can I get you the list so you can start investigating?

676
00:37:30,418 --> 00:37:32,258
好的  要是你能給我們列個名單...
Yeah, you -- Yeah, if you could get us that list...

677
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,838
我會...我會打印出來的
Okay, I'll -- I'll print it out.

678
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:35,778
漢克·阿倫卡  鑄幣級
Hank Aaron, mint.

679
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:38,568
天  我的德瑞克·基特簽名
God, my signed Derek Jeter.

680
00:37:38,768 --> 00:37:40,488
威利·梅斯  奧皮奇收藏卡
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.

681
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:43,438
深呼吸  深呼吸
Got to breathe. Just keep breathing.

682
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:44,388
繼續深呼吸
Keep breathing.

683
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,018
-好吧  -我就說嘛
- Okay. - I know, right?

684
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,308
沒拿走電視機
Left the TV.

685
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:50,798
-沒拿走電腦  -沒錯
- Left the computer. - Right.

686
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,508
眼前這情況看上去有點不對勁
There's something wrong with this picture.

687
00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:28,797
喂  是我
Hey, it's me.

688
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:30,827
我又在這個天堂度過了完美的一天
Another perfect day in paradise out here.

689
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,417
我在泳池里
I'm in the pool.

690
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:34,957
給我回電
Okay, call me.

691
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,737
-你好嗎  -寶貝  吃過中飯了嗎
- How are you? - Hey, babe. Did you get lunch?

692
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:54,787
我吃了
I did.

693
00:39:54,787 --> 00:39:56,807
我覺得我背上快被曬焦了
You know, I think I'm burning up back here.

694
00:39:56,997 --> 00:39:58,907
真的嗎  你可真走運
Oh, really? Well, you're just in luck.

695
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,007
-瞧瞧我拿了什么  -太好了
- Look what I have. - Oh, hey, great.

696
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,907
你這里都被曬紅了
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here. Yeah.

697
00:40:08,407 --> 00:40:09,767
好爽啊  寶貝
That feels good, babe.

698
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,457
我跟你說過了不要在太陽下待太久
I told you not to spend so much time in the sun.

699
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:13,557
你就是不聽
You don't listen.

700
00:40:15,557 --> 00:40:17,147
喂  又是我
Yeah, it's me again.

701
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:21,517
我說話這當兒  離我不到八米的地方
Listen, as I speak, not 25 feet away from me,

702
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:24,617
我正看著目標
I'm looking at the mark.

703
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:28,487
{an3}{pos(374,227)}喜劇《蓋里爾的島》中的大富翁

704
00:40:24,617 --> 00:40:28,487
想象下豪威爾·瑟斯頓三世和金吉同居后的樣子
Think Thurston Howell III if he shacked up with Ginger.

705
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:30,217
他渾身上下都是古馳牌的
He's dripping in Gucci.

706
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:32,287
就好像  我蹲在水坑里
It's like I'm at the watering hole,

707
00:40:32,287 --> 00:40:35,507
我是準備出擊的母獅  看著那頭
and I'm watching the fattest, slowest water buffalo

708
00:40:35,507 --> 00:40:39,737
最肥最遲緩的水牛向我露出了脖子
expose his neck to me, and I'm the lioness ready to strike.

709
00:40:41,037 --> 00:40:42,097
來吧  金
Come, Kim.

710
00:40:42,427 --> 00:40:45,897
加入我吧  加入獅群吧
Join me. Join the pride.

711
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:50,547
我剛說母獅
Um, I said "Lioness"

712
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:53,817
是因為狩獵是母獅的活兒
because it's the females who do all the hunting.

713
00:40:53,817 --> 00:40:56,567
只是想準確描述這個物種
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate,

714
00:40:56,567 --> 00:40:58,047
跟我的性別無關
irrespective of my own sex.

715
00:40:58,047 --> 00:41:00,427
就像《國家地理》上提過的那樣...
It's a National Geographic thing. Anyway...

716
00:41:01,677 --> 00:41:02,717
我掛了
Get out here.

717
00:41:03,867 --> 00:41:04,757
再見
Bye.

718
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:49,807
圣達菲  新墨西哥州
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

719
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:53,207
我想知道戴維斯梅因律所的電話
I need the number of a law firm -- Davis & Main.

720
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:56,247
好的  幫我轉接下
Yeah, you can connect me.

721
00:43:35,527 --> 00:43:38,847
公司用車上有多種選擇
There are a few options on the company cars.

722
00:43:38,847 --> 00:43:41,277
您有空的時候我們可以安排試駕

723
00:43:41,277 --> 00:43:43,087
公司用車  哇

00:43:46,937 --> 00:43:48,967
如果您覺得不滿意
And if you find you're not happy with it,

727
00:43:49,117 --> 00:43:50,607
隨時都能換
it's not a big deal to change it out.

728
00:43:50,607 --> 00:43:52,417
聽上去真是...
That sounds really, uh...

729
00:43:53,777 --> 00:43:54,617
太好了
Yeah.

730
00:44:03,257 --> 00:44:05,307
真有意思
This is, uh, interesting.

731
00:44:05,607 --> 00:44:06,937
如果...
Oh, if, uh...

732
00:44:07,087 --> 00:44:09,277
如果這不符合您的品味
If this isn't to your taste,

733
00:44:09,277 --> 00:44:11,037
我們倉庫里有各種畫作
we have a collection of art in-house

734
00:44:11,037 --> 00:44:12,627
您可自由選擇
you can, uh, choose from.

00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,647
我能給您一些樣品供您挑選
I can put together some samples for you to review.

737
00:44:15,937 --> 00:44:18,187
我...不  我就喜歡這個
I-I-I -- No, I like this.

738
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:23,127
好的  您要是還有別的需要  我隨時效勞
Good. Uh, well, any other needs you have, I'm here to help.

有什么指定的食物想放在冰箱里嗎
Anything special you want stocked in the fridge?

741
00:44:28,747 --> 00:44:31,947
要加濕器嗎  這里有點干燥
Uh, maybe a humidifier? Gets kind of dry in here.

742
00:44:31,947 --> 00:44:34,087
奧馬爾  我這人很隨意的
Omar, I-I'm pretty low-maintenance.

743
