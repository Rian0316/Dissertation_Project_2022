00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
缘竿而上

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,680
汉弗莱 你胡说什么?
Humphrey, what are you havering about?

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,310
没说什么 只说大臣不一定批准
I'm simply saying we can't take the Minister's approval for granted.

7
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,074
意大利政府出了份大合同
The Italian government have offered a massive contract

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,516
要我们在莫西塞德郡生产丙醇
to manufacture propanol at our Merseyside plant,

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,992
这份合同 让我们正要倒闭的工厂起死回生
which means saving a plant we were going to have to close,

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,948
免除失业 增加出口税
saving jobs, earning export royalties.

11
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,352
这还不明显?他非批不可      但如果大臣想...
He has to give us the go-ahead. But if the Minister thinks...

12
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,192
大臣哪会想事
Ministers don't think!

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,111
别跟我提大臣
Don't talk to me about Ministers.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,829
我做了10年英国化工集团董事长
I've been chairman of British Chemical Corporation forten years,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,629
一共跟19名大臣打过交道      天哪天哪
and in that time dealt with nineteen different Ministers.

16
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,234
他们总在瞎忙 没空见我
They've usually not had time to see me,

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,349
整天行贿工会领导人让他们别罢工
because they're too busy bribing Trade Union leaders not to strike.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,671
得了 沃利 他们没行贿      真的吗?
They've never bribed anybody. Oh, no?

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,310
进公营机构吧 张三 当骑士吧 李四 领爵位吧 王五
"Have a quango, Tom; a knighthood, Dick; a peerage, Harry".

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,155
可大臣担心...      大臣他当然担心了
But the Minister's worried... Of course he's worried!

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,595
我要是不能让这些
If I'd neverdone anything to worry

22
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,433
胆小鬼 做秀家 拉票狂担心起来
those vote-grabbing baby-kissing jellies,

23
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,068
我们集团10年前就玩完了
we'd have gone down the tube ten years ago!

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,199
可你说丙醇含变性二恶英      那又如何?
But propanol contains metadioxin. So what?

25
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,114
二恶英在萨维索(意大利)泄漏过 会伤害胎儿
Dioxin was released at Seveso. It can damage the foetus.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,558
二恶英归二恶英 变性二恶英是种非活性化合物
That's dioxin, for Christ's sake! Metadioxin is an inert compound.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,996
华盛顿食品药物管理局都开出了安全证明
It's been given a clean bill of health by Washington.

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,991
你设立的亨德森委员会
The Henderson Committee, which you set up,

29
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,434
也会这么说的
will give it the OK, too.

30
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,434
我知道 沃利 但这名字可能有些政治敏感性
I know, Wally, but the name could be politically sensitive.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,433
可我在提案里没提变性二恶英
But I've taken metadioxin out of the proposal.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,034
单单是丙醇      你真英明
I call it propanol. Very wise of you.

33
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,590
你让我写的      那我真英明
You told me to. Very wise of me!

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,596
照我说 大臣不会反对的 只是手段问题
But the Ministermay raise no objections, it just needs tact.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,275
好的 那就是没问题了
Fine. In that case, there's no problem.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,273
我跟你去 使些手段
I'll have a tactful word with Hacker

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,193
亲自说服哈克那浆糊脑袋
and persuade the blancmange myself.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,031
我觉得...不是我不信你 沃利
Don't take this amiss, Wally,

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,839
幸运的话 凭我就能说服他
but I might just be able to manage

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,151
不用你那种...自成一家的...手段
without your unique... brand of tact.

41
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,518
多好的消息啊 汉弗莱      是 大臣
This is wonderful news, Humphrey. Yes, Minister.

42
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,152
濒临倒闭的工厂 一夜间成了化工集团的摇钱树
We turn a run-down plant from loss-maker into a profitable unit,

43
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,153
他们成了欧洲最大的丙醇工厂
the largest manufacturer of propanol in Europe.

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,949
是 大臣      英国制造的领先设备
Yes, Minister. Equipment made in UK factories.

45
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,033
地方政府得益 出口贸易交流
Income for the local authorities, foreign exchange from exports.

46
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,430
好得不像真的      确实是真的 大臣
Too good to be true! It is true.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,752
丙醇真好...到底什么是丙醇?
Good old propanol... What is propanol, actually?

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,000
很有意思 丙醇从前用二恶英制造
It used to be made with dioxin

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,711
自从意大利萨维索泄漏事故
until the Seveso explosion

50
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,510
之后就重新开发了安全化合物 名为变性二恶英
then they developed a safe compound, metadioxin.

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,231
意大利的工厂被封闭 得请英国化工集团来制造
Italian factory is sealed off so they've asked the BCC to make it.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,630
算他们倒霉      确实有点
An ill wind. Quite so.

53
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,076
这东西真的安全吧?     绝对安全     那就好
But this stuff is perfectly safe? Perfectly.

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,631
软弱的大臣或许会对相似名字抱以怀疑
Weak Ministers might have doubts over the similarity of the names,

55
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,394
但有骨气的大臣不会
but no one with any backbone would be deflected

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,312
拒绝如此有利的项目
from such a beneficial project

57
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,710
就为这点细枝末节
on such a useless pretext.

58
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,515
可不是 我知道那种大臣 政治软脚虾
I know just the sort of Minister you mean. Political jellyfish.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,513
不敢做决策 生怕招惹谁
Terrified of taking any decision.

60
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,672
反正 决策总会得罪人的
Afterall, every decision upsets someone, doesn't it?

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,858
尽责的政府做出正确决策
Good government is doing what's right

62
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,958
而不是受欢迎的 是吧汉弗莱?
not just what's popular.

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,953
所言极是 大臣      不过这会受欢迎吧?
Absolutely, Minister. But this will be popular?

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,795
肯定大受欢迎      汉弗莱 确认一下
Very popular. Humphrey, I want to be sure.

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,077
你不是要我展现魄力吧?
You're not asking me to make a courageous decision, are you?

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,996
绝对没有 大臣 这说哪里话
Of course not, Minister.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,197
那就好 要提上内阁吗?
Good, good. Should I take it to Cabinet?

68
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,033
我觉得越低调越好      为什么?
I think the less said, the better. Why?

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,634
尽管变性二恶英完全无害
Although metadioxin is totally harmless,

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,110
这名称可能会让无知的人紧张
the name may cause anxiety in ignorant minds.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,989
汉弗莱 你是说我的内阁同僚?
Humphrey, you're talking about my Cabinet colleagues.

72
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,116
我说的是"地球之友"组织      这倒是
I was referring to the Friends of the Earth.

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,235
喂? 琼・利特勒来了 大臣 她是西南利物浦的议员
Yes? Joan Littlerhas arrived, MP for Liverpool South West.

74
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,038
好的 她来有何打算?
Know what she wants?

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,997
当然 她是首相的政务次官
She's the Prime Minister's PPS,

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,549
新工厂坐落于她的选区
and the new plant is in her constituency.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,600
好 让她进来 汉弗莱你先出去好吗?
Showher in. If you'll excuse us?

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,589
首相政务次官? 我还是留下吧
The PM's PPS? I think I'll stay.

79
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
琼・利特勒 大臣 西南利物浦的议员
Joan Littler, memberfor Liverpool South West.

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,714
琼 你认识汉弗莱・阿普比吗?     很高兴见到您
Do you know Humphrey Appleby? Delighted to meet you.

81
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,677
快坐下
Do take a seat.

82
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,354
谢谢 伯纳      伯纳
Thank you, Bernard. Bernard...

83
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,520
好吧 有什么我能效劳的?
Now, what can I do foryou?

84
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,231
吉姆 化工集团要把我的选区怎样?
Jim, what's the BCC up to in my constituency?

85
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,030
即将启动一项振奋人心的新项目 促进就业和投资
They'll be announcing a very exciting project, with new jobs.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,875
对 但有些很可怕的传闻
Yes... but there's some very worrying rumours.

87
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,508
比如?      有关有害化学品
Such as? Rumours of dangerous chemicals.

88
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,035
化学品都有害
All chemicals are dangerous...

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,512
大臣说那是空穴来风 不必担心
The Ministermeans the rumours are unfounded, no cause for alarm.

90
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,356
我不管 你能保证先做公开调查吗?
Can I have your assurance there'll be a full public enquiry?

91
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,559
调查一下也不错
Not a bad idea...

92
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,191
大臣是说完全不必公开调查
The Ministerwas about to say there's no need foran enquiry.

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,071
已经在研究了 近期会公布报告
A report will be issued shortly.

94
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:46,071
听好 我是来问吉姆的
I came here to talk to Jim.

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,313
你是在问他啊      可都是你替他答的
You are talking to him. But he's not answering, you are!

96
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,517
大臣与我想法一致      谁的想法 你的?
The Ministerand I are of one mind. Whose? Yours?

97
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,554
我听说就是这种产品污染了意大利萨维索
I've heard this factory made the chemical that poisoned Seveso!

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,836
没那事      是吗?
That's not true. Isn't it?

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,913
萨维索那是二恶英 这是变性二恶英
The chemical in Seveso was dioxin. This is metadioxin.

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,550
还不是一样      名字相似而已
That's virtually the same thing. Just a similar name.

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,156
只不过前面加了变性两字
It's the same name with "meta" stuck on the front.

102
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,518
这就大不相同了      为什么 变性是什么意思?
That makes all the difference. Why? What does "meta" mean?

103
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,100
变性什么意思 汉弗莱?
What does "meta" mean, Humphrey?

104
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,633
简单 意思是"副" "后"或"超"
"With", "after" or "beyond".

105
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,828
词源来自希腊 就是"后二恶英"或"超二恶英"
From the Greek, of course. "After" dioxin or "beyond" dioxin.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,073
如果用宾格 就是"超"或"后"
If it's in the accusative, it's "beyond orafter",

107
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,199
用所有格就是"副" 拉丁语也是 您当然记得
with the genitive it's "with", as in Latin, as you no doubt recall.

108
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,830
"副"作前缀就得用离格
The ablative is used forwords needing "with" to precede them.

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,879
不过当然 希腊语没有离格
But of course, there isn't an ablative in Greek.

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,156
说得好 伯纳      谢谢
Well done, Bernard. Thank you.

111
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,036
明白了吧?      不 不明白
You see? Not exactly, no.

112
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,670
我觉得挺清楚的      我想知道的是
I thought thatwas perfectly plain. What I insist on knowing

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,231
这两种药品的本质区别何在
is what is the actual difference between dioxin and metadioxin.

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,312
好说 变性二恶英是二恶英的一种非活性化合物
Metadioxin is an inert compound of dioxin.

115
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,393
我好像明白了 汉弗莱
I think I follow that, Humphrey,

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,711
不过你能不能再解释清楚一点?
but could you explain it a little more clearly?

117
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,476
哪一方面 大臣?      非活性是什么意思?
In what sense, Minister? What does "inert" mean?

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,551
就是它没...
It means it's not...

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,594
活性
... ert.

120
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,470
连只苍蝇都"活"不了
Wouldn't "ert" a fly.

121
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,508
你说什么 伯纳?      没什么 大臣
What did you say, Bernard? Nothing, Minister.

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,875
实际应用中什么意思?
What does that mean in practical terms?

123
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,234
你是说化学上?
You mean chemically?

124
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,109
对 化学上     化学上怎么说?
Yes, chemically. What does it mean chemically?

125
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,192
我不知道怎么用通俗语言解释
I can't explain it in layman's language...

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,875
你懂化学吗?      当然不懂 大臣
Do you know any chemistry? Of course not, Minister.

127
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,395
我是拿奖学金项目的
I was in the scholarship form.

128
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,394
古典文学系
Classics.

129
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,190
化合物又是什么?     你也不懂化学?
And what's a compound? Don't you know any chemistry?

130
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,588
不懂 你呢?
No. Do you?

131
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,034
我们应该懂点 对吧?      化合物就是...
We ought to, oughtn't we? A compound is a...

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,753
你们都知道复合利息吧?
You know what compound interest is?

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,514
对对 让人高兴的东西
Yes, well, a jolly good thing.

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,035
化合物大概就这意思
That's the sort of thing a compound is.

135
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,559
就是这样
That's it, then.

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,998
总而言之 我们已经达成共识
To sum up, I think we're all of the same mind, broadly speaking.

137
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,469
可以批准了
We're ready to go ahead.

138
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,712
我可没这么说过
I've said no such thing!

139
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,439
我们都同意 只是名称问题
The only difference is in the name,

140
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,479
二恶英和变性二恶英 就像利特勒和希特勒
dioxin and metadioxin, like... Littlerand Hitler.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,436
总不会因为名字像 你为人也像他吧
Not that you're like Hitler because yourname's similar!

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,795
重点不在这里      那在哪里?
That's not the point. What is the point?

143
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,872
重点是 这工厂在我选区里
The point is this factory is in my constituency!

144
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,510
这会给选区带来更多资金和就业
It'll be good forthe constituency, more jobs, more money.

145
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,389
我们最多得罪几个杞人忧天的环保主义者
The only people we'll offend are a few environmentalists.

146
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,711
顶多...百来张票
At most, it won't cost us more than 100 votes.

147
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,231
我的多数票只有91票
My majority is 91.

148
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,909
还不提旁边3个边缘选区票更少
Not to mention the three marginal constituencies bordering mine!

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,036
说到这个 我能不能再插一句?
Could I intervene just once more?

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,034
化工集团这个丙醇项目可是倍受期待
The case forthe BCC manufacturing propanol is overwhelming.

151
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,315
倍受期待
Overwhelming.

152
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,359
好工作 高收入 出口订单也跑不了
Great jobs, increased income and secure, profitable export orders.

153
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,078
出口订单      另外
Export orders. Furthermore...

154
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,596
华盛顿食品药品局宣布该产品安全
The drug has been declared safe by Washington,

155
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,069
华盛顿      我们也在准备相关报告
Washington. We're preparing a report, too.

156
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,071
大臣坚信
The Minister is confident

157
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,313
这个项目能使你的选区乃至全国受益
this scheme is to the advantage of constituency and country.

158
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,109
如果证实了不安全 我也不会批
If it proves not to be safe, I won't allow its manufacture here.

159
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,397
可如果报告说它安全 不批就亏了 是吧?
But if the report says it is safe, that'd be absurd, wouldn't it?

160
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,114
我可不服气 吉姆
I'm not satisfied with that, Jim.

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,156
记住 是政党让你作议员
Rememberthat the party made you an MP,

162
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,916
如果下次政党落选 你也别当大臣了
and you can't be a Minister if your party loses the next election.

163
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,115
您还是不放心 大臣
You still don't look happy, Minister.

164
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,637
看起来行 可如果报告没你说的那么准
Suppose the report isn't as conclusive as you say.

165
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,156
谁是亨德森 我要不要去见见他?      没必要
Oughtn't I to meet this Henderson? No need.

166
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,154
亨德森教授是剑桥优秀生化专家 我们精心挑选的
He's a brilliant Cambridge biochemist, chosen with some care.

167
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,596
如果他的报告说"有待观望"呢?
Suppose he produces a cautious, wait-and-see report?

168
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,752
那我们不公布 改用美国报告
We don't publish it. We use the American report instead.

169
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,114
很好很好
Fine!

170
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,594
你是说禁掉它?      当然不是 只是不公布而已
You mean we suppress it? No, we just don't publish it.

171
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,231
有什么区别?      区别可大了
What's the difference? All the difference in the world!

172
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,039
查禁是独裁专政的手段
Suppression is the instrument of dictatorships.

173
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,112
我们自由国家不讲这些
We don't talk of that sort of thing in a free country.

174
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,714
我们经民主程序决议不公布
We take a democratic decision not to publish.

175
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,834
好 那我对媒体和议会怎么说?
Fine. What am I to say to the press and parliament?

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,117
"我们期待报告说这个决策很英明"
"We hoped the report would say it was a wise decision.

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,909
"但它说不行 所以我们当它不存在"
But we've cocked it up so we'll pretend the report doesn't exist".

178
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,355
很好笑 大臣      那该怎么说?
Very droll. What would I say?

179
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,432
有一套官方程序用来查禁...
There's a Government procedure for suppress...

180
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,512
决议不公布报告      真的?
...deciding not to publish reports. Really?

181
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,194
当然 只要降低它的可信性
You simply discredit them.

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,839
老天啊
Good heavens!

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,395
怎么做?
How?

184
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,719
第一步 从公众利益角度出发
Stage One, give your reasons in terms of the public interest.

185
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,919
暗示存在泄密隐患      我记个笔记行吗?
Hint at security considerations... Mind if I make a note?

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,716
好像很有用 可以拿来
This could be useful for discrediting

187
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,633
打发党内某些笨蛋的研究文件
some of the party's idiotic research documents.

188
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,113
指出该报告将给政府施加压力 引起误解
The report could put pressure on Government and be misinterpreted.

189
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,989
什么都可能被误解 耶酥的山上宝训也逃不过
Anything could be misinterpreted. The Sermon on the Mount could be!

190
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,598
确实 如果山上宝训是政府文件 绝对不宜发表
Indeed the Sermon should not have been published.

191
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,270
该文件非常不负责任
A most irresponsible document.

192
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,908
那套善有善报的说法
All that stuff about the meek inheriting the earth

193
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,550
有可能严重降低国防预算
could do irreparable damage to the defence budget.

194
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,550
我看也是 还有吗?
I suppose you're right. What else?

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,191
然后说 最好等待长期具体报告
Say it's better to wait for a more detailed study over longertime.

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,633
如果没有呢?      那更好 自己派人写
Suppose there isn't one? Commission one.

197
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,155
更加游刃有余
Gives you even more time to play with.

198
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,869
这些都是第一步?      对 在第二阶段
All this is Stage One? Yes. In Stage Two...

199
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,474
推翻那些你未公开的证据
discredit the evidence you're not publishing.

200
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,270
没公开怎么推翻?      大臣 没公开更好推翻
How, if you're not publishing it? It's easier if it's not published.

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,512
给媒体透个风 当然是小道消息
Do it by press leaks, of course, not directly.

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,036
说有些重要问题尚待解决
Say it leaves important questions unanswered,

203
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,997
证据说服力不强
the evidence is inconclusive,

204
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,118
数据可以有别的阐释
the figures are open to other interpretations,

205
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,795
某些研究结果自相矛盾
that certain findings are contradictory,

206
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,714
某些重点结论被人质疑
and that some of the main conclusions have been questioned.

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,474
要是没人质疑呢?      自己质疑啊
Suppose they haven't? Then question them!

208
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,878
这不就有了
Then they have!

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,350
要提出质疑 得仔细读懂它吧
But you'd have to go through it with a fine-toothed comb.

210
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,195
不用不用 没读过也能提
No, no, no. You'd say all these things without reading it.

211
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,956
凡是报告 都有没解决的问题
There's always some questions unanswered.

212
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,634
比如说?      那些还没提出来的问题啊
Such as? The ones that weren't asked.

213
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,037
第二步结束?      对 第三步
That's Stage Two? Yes. In Stage Three...

214
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,634
贬低报告中的建议
you undermine recommendations.

215
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,395
说它不足以作为长期计划的基础
"Not a basis for long-term decisions.

216
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,916
没有足够信息
Not sufficient information

217
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,230
进行有效评估
on which to base a valid assessment".

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,193
当前政策并不需要推翻重来
"Not really any need for a fundamental rethink of policies".

219
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,353
总的来说 与现有做法区别不大 就这么简单
"Broadly speaking, endorses current practice". It's easy.

220
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,351
有用吗?      几乎次次成功
That works? Nearly always.

221
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,273
没成功怎么办?      那就进入第四步
Suppose it doesn't? Move on to Stage Four.

222
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,475
还有四?
Stage Four?

223
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,189
第四步 质疑报告撰写者
Discredit the man who produced the report.

224
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,952
当然不能明说
Off the record.

225
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,159
暗示他对政府早已不满 或者想出风头
Say that he's harbouring a grudge against the Government

226
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,312
更有甚者 说他为跨国公司
or, betterstill, that he used to be a consultant

227
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,596
做过顾问
to a multi-national company.

228
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,957
他没做过呢?      那就是想做
Supposing he wasn't? Then he's hoping to be.

229
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,839
人人都想做跨国公司顾问
Everybody's hoping to be a consultant to a multi-national.

230
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,279
要么他觊觎爵位 或学院院长职位
Orhe's trying for a knighthood orvice-chancellorship.

231
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,034
大臣您看 可能性多了去了
There are endless possibilities.

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,599
打扰一下 大臣
Excuse me.

233
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,038
宣传办来电话 说丙醇工厂上了新闻
The press officerrang to say there's an item on the news.

234
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,430
好好 快开电视 我怎么不知道有
Yes, yes. Why wasn't I told?

235
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,797
化工集团没有义务向我们报告
The BCC aren't obliged to clear itwith us.

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,710
默西赛德地区爆发了骚乱
A rowhas blown up on Merseyside

237
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,953
抗议特批意大利政府委托化工集团
about a plan for the BCC to manufacture propanol

238
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,350
在该地区生产丙酮
under licence forthe Italian government.

239
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,193
很明显 丙醇内含变性二恶英
Apparently, propanol contains metadioxin,

240
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,830
化工集团宣称其无毒无害
which the BCC claims to be completely harmless.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,468
然而 这是二恶英的化合物
It is a compound of dioxin,

242
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,270
二恶英曾在意大利萨维索泄漏
the chemical released after an explosion at Seveso

243
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,714
于1976年7月
in July 1976,

244
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,077
毒雾扩散到方圆4英里内
spreading poisonous dust over a 4-mile radius.

245
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,795
今天 默西赛德抗议者们在工厂门外疾呼
On Merseyside, protesters voiced their opposition to the BCC scheme

246
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,871
抗议化工集团的计划
outside the factory gates.

247
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,918
我跟你说 我们要怎样
I'll tell you what we'll do.

248
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,516
叫沃利爵士带上他的毒药赶紧滚蛋
Sir Wally can take his poison chemicals somewhere else!

249
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,310
我闺女还有3个月就生娃了
I've a daughter expecting a baby,

250
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,869
我可不想要个怪胎孙子
and my grandchild's not gonna be deformed

251
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,871
便宜那些意大利佬
for them bloody Eyeties'sake!

252
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,798
政府若把我们小民放在眼里 他们绝不会批准
If the Government cared about people, they'd never allow it!

253
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,672
化工集团称 丙醇的安全性报告
The BCC said a report on the safety of propanol

254
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,355
近期将由行政事务部发布
was due to be published shortly by Administrative Affairs.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,150
下面是国际新闻 今天...
And now abroad again...

256
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,100
这变性二恶英简直是炸药
This metadioxin is dynamite.

257
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,519
大臣 我保证它完全无害
It's totally harmless.

258
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,910
化学上无害 政治上有害
Only chemically, not politically.

259
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,277
它伤不了人      它能把我报销掉
It can't hurt anyone. It could finish me off!

260
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,597
喂? 大臣 10号找您
Yes? Minister, Number 10 on the phone.

261
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,472
是政治部 首相刚刚看了新闻
The political office, the PM's just seen the news.

262
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,919
你好 我是吉姆
Hello, Jim here!

263
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,838
对 我刚才也看了
Yes, I just saw that, too.

264
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,195
地方上有点困难 别太担心
We don't need to be too worried about a little local difficulty.

265
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,793
想想就业机会和出口利益
Not in view of the jobs and exports...

266
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,198
不 没那么多岗位
No, not many jobs.

267
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,993
90来个吧 我觉得
Ninety, I think.

268
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,794
对 可是...
Yes, but...

269
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,234
你当然了
You do, do you?

270
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,273
对 好吧
Yes, well...

271
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,112
我也刚想这么说呢 对对
I was coming round to that viewpoint myself.

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,314
汉弗莱
Humphrey...

273
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,357
我突然想到一件事情      我看出来了
Something just struck me. I noticed.

274
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,796
你看 这项计划的争议很大
There are arguments against this scheme.

275
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,598
大臣 您已经同意...      对 但它可能损害
Minister, you've already agreed... It could lead to a loss of...

276
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,870
公信力      您说选票?
...public confidence. You mean votes?

277
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:45,558
选票? 不不 和选票无关 不用考虑它
Votes? No, no. It's not the votes that are a consideration at all.

278
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,314
但是你看 这是公众的意愿
But you see, it's the public will.

279
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,198
我们提倡民主
This is a democracy...

280
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,148
人民并不同意      人民既愚昧又盲目
and the people don't like it. They are ignorant and misguided.

281
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,356
汉弗莱 就是人民选出我的
It was the people who elected me!

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,317
大臣 事情在一周之后就能平息
In a week, the whole thing will have blown over,

283
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,917
一年之后 莫西塞德工厂将安全成功地运营着
and in a year's time, we'll have a safe and successful factory.

284
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,638
一周对政治算长的 汉弗莱
Aweek's a long time in politics.

285
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,791
一年对政府算短的
A year's a short time in Government.

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,077
你属于政府 我属于政治 现在首相很生气
You're in Government, I'm in politics and the PM is not pleased.

287
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,596
大臣 尽管我极其尊敬...      又想讽刺我了?
With the greatest respect... Going to insult me again?

288
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,550
可以说您把政党置于国家之上
You're putting party before country.

289
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,029
又是这陈词滥调?没点新鲜的吗?
Can't you think of a new clich?

290
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,115
大臣 "新鲜的陈词滥调"恐怕自相矛盾
Minister, a new clich?could be said to be a contradiction in terms.

291
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,113
汉弗莱 你不懂 你的生活安稳有保障
Humphrey, you lead a sheltered life.

292
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,714
而我必须在政坛存活 我才不得罪首相
I intend to survive and I'm not crossing the PM.

293
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,590
大臣 您为什么一定要顺竿爬?
Why must you be so concerned with climbing the greasy pole?

294
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,308
这很重要 我必须爬
The greasy pole is important. I have to climb it.

295
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,708
为什么?
Why?

296
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,997
因为有竿在那里
'Cause it's there!

297
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,355
请接泰晤士报的编辑 谢谢你 伯纳
The editor of the Times, please. Thank you, Bernard.

298
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,033
怎么泰晤士报比我还先看到报告?
How come the Times knows about the report before I do?

299
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
有人泄漏出去 大臣      我也知道
There's been a leak. I know that!

300
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,915
这是机密 我昨晚才拿到草案
Itwas "Confidential". I only got a draft last night.

301
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,389
幸好不是"内参"      为什么?
At least itwasn't "Restricted". Why?

302
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,393
"内参"的话昨天就见报了
"Restricted" means itwas in the papers yesterday.

303
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,077
"机密"才拖到今天
"Confidential" means it won't be in the papers till today.

304
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,151
谁泄漏的?汉弗莱?
Who leaked this? Humphrey?

305
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,040
我确定不是他 大臣      真的?
I'm sure he didn't, Minister. Are you?

306
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,789
大概不是他      是吗?
He probably didn't. No?

307
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,555
可能是其他人      这些泄漏真是耻辱
It might have been someone else. These leaks are a disgrace!

308
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,679
人民会以为是政客干的      本来也是这样
People think it's the politicians. It has been known.

309
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,549
依我看 我们漏的远没有被漏的多
In my opinion, we're farmore leaked against than leaking.

310
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,876
"政治懦夫否决化工集团提案 明哲保身"
"Political cowardice to reject the BCC proposal".

311
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,473
"哈克别无选择"
"Hackerhas no choice".

312
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,589
汉弗莱以为能让我负责 是吗?
Humphrey thinks he's got me committed!

313
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,035
这是非官方消息 漏的是草案
It's an unofficial leak of a draft report.

314
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,792
您无需负责
You're committed to nothing.

315
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,474
研究报告向着您吗?
Does the report give you a way out?

316
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,917
顺便 大臣 沃利・麦克弗兰爵士要见您
SirWally McFarlane is waiting to see you.

317
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,355
好吧 不过他来也白来
All right. But he's wasting his time.

318
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,670
沃利爵士 请进      谢谢您 早安
Come in, please, Sir Wally. Thank you. Morning.

319
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,274
早安      我能参加吗 大臣?
Morning. May I join you, Minister?

320
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,917
想来就来吧 请坐      谢谢 吉姆
Lf you like. Do sit down. Thank you, Jim.

321
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,870
那么      谢谢 伯纳
Now... Thank you, Bernard.

322
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,352
对不起
Sorry about that.

323
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,796
我看报了 亨德森报告明确支持我们
I see from the press the Henderson Report comes clearly on ourside.

324
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,272
我也看见了      那研究组漏得像筛子
I've seen that, too. That committee leaks like a sieve.

325
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,551
好了大臣 那新工厂就没阻力了
So there's no real case for refusing permission for the new plant.

326
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,032
我不太确定      听好 吉姆
I'm not sure yet. Now look, Jim...

327
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,069
这合同花费我们两年心血 至关重要
We've been working on this for two years, it's very important.

328
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,509
我是董事长兼化学家 我告诉你 变性二恶英无毒
I'm the chairman, and I tell you as a chemist, metadioxin is safe.

329
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,989
怎么你们专家总以为自己没错?
You experts always think you're right.

330
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,994
难不成门外汉了解得更清楚?
The more inexpert you are, the more likely you are to be right?

331
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,957
大臣们不是专家
Ministers are not experts.

332
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,237
选他们就是因为他们无知
They're chosen because they know nothing.

333
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,515
你承认啦?
You admit that?

334
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,711
对技术细节一无所知
Nothing about technical details.

335
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,029
大臣必须为国家大局着想 所以我还不确定
Ministers must take a broaderview, that's why I cannot commit yet.

336
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,428
听着 哈克
Look, Hacker!

337
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,068
你在犯错误 你心里清楚
This is the wrong decision and you know it.

338
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,753
懦弱 没骨气
It's cowardly and craven!

339
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,309
我不是懦夫      给我坐下
I am not cowardly... Sit down!

340
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,474
不就是为了那几个选区的几张选票吗?
You'll lose a few votes from a few people in those constituencies?

341
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,756
这是可悲      这是政治
It's pathetic! It's politics!

342
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,114
没错
Exactly!

343
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,472
我要上报工业部长
I'll be writing to the Secretary of State for Industry.

344
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,150
你不批项目我就辞职
I am prepared to resign if you block this one!

345
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,788
这下您意下如何 大臣?
How do you feel that went, Minister?

346
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,751
再选一个董事长不就完了      再选一个?
We'll have to get another chairman. Get another?

347
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,480
没人想接手这份工作
Nobody would accept a job like that!

348
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,316
没人想管国营企业 这是自取灭亡
Nobody wants to be chairman of nationalised industry: Instant ruin

349
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,951
最好上任当天就拿遣散费走人 早晚一样
They may as well accept the golden handshake the day they start.

350
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,715
总能找到一个      找个研究老年病的美国废物
We'll find someone. Some useless American geriatric.

351
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,438
不见得
Not necessarily.

352
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,831
正经人谁敢接手工业部门
How do you expect to find a decent replacement,

353
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,754
如果他的前任为正确决策而被迫辞职
when we forced his predecessor to resign fortaking a sound decision,

354
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,036
而且还是政治原因?
which we blocked for political reasons?

355
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,034
又是这套 我别无选择啊      大臣可以随心所欲
I have no choice. A Minister can do what he likes.

356
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,679
民主至上
It's the people's will.

357
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,195
我是他们的领头人 应该跟他们走
I am their leader. I must follow them.

358
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,071
我良心清白 两手干净
My hands are clean.

359
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,869
我觉得一个人见竿就爬
I thought itwas rather difficult to keep one's hands clean

360
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,429
想两手干净也难
while climbing the greasy pole.

361
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,549
伯纳 得阻止沃利闹事
We must stop Wally making a fuss.

362
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,518
他会在记者招待会上骂我目光短浅
Press conferences accusing me of lack of faith.

363
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,229
还有全景周刊采访(左翼刊物)     我该怎么办?
Interviews on Panorama. What am I to do?

364
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,030
如果我不批 泰晤士报和每日邮报会骂我政治懦夫
If I stop it, the Times will accuse me of political cowardice.

365
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,194
如果我批了 镜报和太阳报又会说我扼杀胎儿
If I let it, the Mirror will say I'm murdering unborn babies.

366
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,353
要是报告说变性二恶英不安全就好了
If only the report had any doubt about the safety of metadioxin.

367
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,830
它肯定不会说吗 大臣?      目前是没有
Are you sure it doesn't, Minister? Not as it stands.

368
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,638
伯纳 亨德森是剑桥的学者?      是
Henderson's a Cambridge man? Yes.

369
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,079
哪所学院?      国王学院 怎么?
Which college? King's. Why?

370
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,157
没事 就想看看是不是我的校友
Nothing. Just wondered if it was my old college.

371
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,958
您不是伦敦政治经济学院毕业的吗?
Weren't you at the LSE?

372
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,393
对对 没错
Yes, so I was.

373
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,960
你有他的档案吗 伯纳?      有 报告里附了
Have you got his file? It's with the report.

374
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,634
给我接剑桥大学       大臣 您应该知道
Got a Cambridge telephone...? You do realise,

375
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,791
当然您不是蓄意的
not that you have any such intention,

376
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,996
但您不应该干涉
but it would be most improper to influence

377
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,037
这种独立报告吧?
an independent report of this nature?

378
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,316
太不应该了 绝对的
Most improper! Out of the question.

379
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,439
我只想去国王学院 会会老朋友
Just it might be nice to pop down to have tea with my old friend,

380
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,479
RA克利顿 国王学院院长 接他的电话
R.A. Crichton, Provost of King's. Get him on the phone.

381
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,552
是 大臣 请接剑桥大学
Yes, Minister. Get me King's College, Cambridge.

382
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,430
谁知道 没准亨德森教授也会去喝茶
Who knows? Professor Henderson might drop in for tea.

383
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,114
无巧不成书嘛 是吧?
That'd be a happy coincidence, wouldn't it?

384
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,193
太正常了 学院同事嘛      这就没什么不妥了吧?
Perfectly natural. Nothing improper about that.

385
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,875
巧遇有什么不妥的?      我也这么觉得
How can a coincidence be improper? Myfeeling entirely.

386
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,635
喂
Yes?

387
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,913
请找克利顿院长
Lord Crichton, please.

388
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,832
从下院升到上院感觉如何?
How's the move from the Commons to the Lords?

389
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,355
像从动物界进了植物界
Like moving from animals to vegetables.

390
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,671
亨德森教授来了      谢谢 见到你太高兴了
Professor Henderson's here. Good to see you.

391
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,479
来见见我的老朋友 吉姆・哈克
Come and meet an old friend, Jim Hacker.

392
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,792
吉姆 这位是亨德森教授      亨德森教授
Jim, this is Professor Henderson. Professor Henderson!

393
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,110
真没想到 大臣也在这里
I didn't expect to see the Minister.

394
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,239
瞧这巧劲      是啊 真巧啊
What a coincidence! Yes, what a coincidence!

395
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,675
你们认识?      第一次见面
You know each other? We haven't met.

396
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,958
我在为他们部写报告      那真巧呢
I'm writing a report forhim. Well, what a coincidence.

397
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,635
是啊 真巧      巧得不能再巧了
Yes, what a coincidence! Extraordinary coincidence.

398
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,588
您对我的报告还满意吧?      当然 非常满意
You're happy with my report? Absolutely. Delighted.

399
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,000
你一定下了不少功夫
You must've worked very hard.

400
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,673
大部分都归功于华盛顿食品药物管理局
Most of it was done by Washington.

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,150
失陪 我去给我老婆倒杯茶
Excuse me, I'll go and help with the tea.

402
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:14,835
说说看 你原来写过政府报告吗?
Tell me, have you everwritten a Government report before?

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,232
没有      你的名字会载入史册
No. Yourname will be on it forever.

404
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,719
"亨德森报告"
"Henderson Report".

405
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,589
有点不朽的意味      这我倒没想过
It's a kind of immortality. I hadn't thought of it like that.

406
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,636
但报告万一出了差错      差错?
But if it were to go wrong... Go wrong?

407
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,079
如果变性二恶英没你说的那么安全
If this metadioxin isn't as safe as you say...

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,274
你的前途...
your career...

409
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,959
非常勇气可嘉
Very courageous!

410
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,472
各标准化测试都显示不存在致畸形毒素
None of the standard tests show evidence of teratogenic toxicity.

411
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,355
标准化测试?原来如此      您想说什么?
Standard tests? Quite. What do you mean?

412
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,275
你看 来时我在火车上记了些问题
Well, I was making a few notes on the train coming down.

413
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,273
尽管我不是生化学家 但似乎
I'm not a biochemist, but it would appear

414
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,195
美国报告中有些重要问题没解决
that the US report leaves some important questions unanswered.

415
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,799
有些证据说服力不强 有些结论被人质疑
Some evidence is inconclusive, some findings have been questioned,

416
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,474
数据可以作别的阐释      所有数据都...
the figures are open to interpretation,

417
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,078
长期深入研究或许会有不同发现
and different results might come from a more detailed study.

418
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,711
当然...      对对 可一旦报告有误
Obviously, but... But if anything did go wrong,

419
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,668
就算十年后出了事 媒体头一个就找你的报告
a delayed effect, the press would go straight to your report.

420
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,071
如果被查出你曾经...比如
And if it turned out that you'd everdone...

421
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,949
为跨国药品公司做过研究
laboratory trials fora multi-national drug company...

422
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
那都过去15年了      14年
Thatwas 15 years ago. 14.

423
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,715
你也知道媒体的可怕
You know what the press is like.

424
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,872
空穴来风 那麻烦可不小
No smoke without a fire. It could be a millstone!

425
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,432
一旦出差错 通俗杂志可要大放厥词
The popular press would be merciless, if anything went wrong:

426
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,558
"亨德森报告的牺牲品们辗转求死"
"Death Agony of Henderson Report Victims".

427
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,434
是
Yes...

428
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,594
是啊
Yes...!

429
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,751
我能怎么办呢?
I don't know what to do!

430
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,278
我不能篡改证据 它确实无毒 报告得承认
I can't alterthe evidence, the report says it's a safe drug.

431
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,194
确实 你没办法了      打扰二位一下
Quite. I see you have no choice. Stop talking shop.

432
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,796
经济学教授急着想与您交谈      是吗
Our Professor of Economics is dying to talk to you.

433
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,032
在为报告的事烦心?我原来写过不少
You're not worried about this report? I've done lots of these

434
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,671
改结论就行 媒体只看那个
It's the phrasing of the conclusion, that's all the press everread.

435
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,910
结尾怎么写的?
Now... how does it end?

436
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,837
我说 据已有证据 委员会没有理由拒绝该项目
"On existing evidence, there is no reason not to proceed".

437
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,471
好吧 这个结论只需要稍加润色
Well, it's just a question of a tidy bit of re-drafting.

438
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,950
"尽管就现有证据 委员会"
"While the committee feel there's no reason

439
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,078
"认为该项目可行"
not to proceed on existing evidence,

440
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,109
"仍需强调 变种二恶英问世未久"
it must be emphasised that metadioxin is a recent compound,

441
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,558
"不可贸然否认 若经长期研究"
and itwould be irresponsible to deny, after further research,

442
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,793
"也许会发现该产品危害人体健康"
its manufacture might be proved to be associated with health risks".

443
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,632
是 这结论能讲通
Yes, that seems perfectly fair.

444
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,355
你能不能再说一遍?
Could you just say that again?

445
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,071
与其那样 不如我给你写下来吧
Better than that... I'll jot it down for you.

446
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,152
行政事务部大臣 詹姆斯・哈克
The Minister for Administrative Affairs, James Hacker,

447
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,153
对外宣布他不会支持

448
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,709
英国化工集团制造丙醇
for the BCC to make propanol.

449
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,236
亨德森报告虽认为该药物大体安全
The Henderson Committee, while generally approving the drug,

450
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,996
却承认经长远研究 也许会发现其有害
said it could not deny that future research might disclose risks.

451
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,676
哈克先生今天访问该工厂时发表了这一讲话
Mr Hackermade his announcement today while visiting BCC's factory,

452
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,274
受到群众热烈欢迎
where he was greeted by an enthusiastic crowd.

453
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,037
体育方面 继昨日大胜...
And now sport. Following last night's defeat...

454
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,675
怎样 大臣
Well, Minister?

455
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,399
怎样 汉弗莱
Well, Humphrey?

456
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,793
您觉得您像个英雄?      是啊
Do you feel like a hero? Indeed I do.

457
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,953
首相一定很满意      我见过的最糟的政府决策
And Number 10 will be delighted. One of the worst decisions ever!

458
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,998
这是我做过的最好的政治决策
And one of the best political decisions I've made.

459
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,030
你觉得呢 伯纳
What do you think, Bernard?

460
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,755
这个...
Well...

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,314
综观多方因素 全面考虑
bearing everything in mind and after due consideration...

462
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,677
总而言之 统而言之
considering all the implications and points of view...

463
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,628
总统而言之 一言以蔽之
well, in otherwords, in fact, I am bound to say...

464
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,438
您非常上镜 大臣
you look awfully good on television, Minister.

465
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,114
汉弗莱 能不能给亨德森颁个巴思勋章?
Humphrey, can we manage a CBE for Henderson?

466
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,193
没门 他这人缺乏判断力 完全靠不住
Certainly not! He's unreliable and lacking in judgement.

467
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,191
我不明白他怎么就在
I can't think why he cast doubt

468
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,669
报告末尾突然转向
on his whole report in that final paragraph.

469
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,152
我觉得他判断准确 高大伟岸 极富人格魅力
He has excellent judgement, enormous stature and great charm.

470
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,479
我记得您说您没见过他
I thought you said you'd nevermet him.

471
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,080
是说他境界伟岸 汉弗莱
I meant intellectual stature, Humphrey.

472
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,559
