1
00:00:04,714 --> 00:00:06,524
这个退休派对真不错
It was a nice retirement party.

2
00:00:06,524 --> 00:00:07,704
是啊
I guess.

3
00:00:07,704 --> 00:00:08,564
不过还是挺可惜的
Still, it's a shame

4
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:11,594
罗斯曼教授是被迫退休的
Professor Rothman was forced to step down.

5
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:13,284
学校也没办法啊
What choice did the university have?

6
00:00:13,284 --> 00:00:14,164
他已经精神崩溃了
He snapped.

7
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,004
理论物理学家不都这样吗
It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.

8
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:20,084
我想知道谢尔顿还有多久才崩溃
I wonder how long Sheldon's got.

9
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,924
这几个虾仁大小都一样
These shrimp are all the same size.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,534
吃的时候都找不到一个有逻辑的次序
There's no the logical order to eat them in.

11
00:00:28,414 --> 00:00:30,044
没多久了
Can't be very long.

12
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:33,974
看啊  这是罗斯曼的办公室人去楼空
Hey, look, there's Rothman's empty office.

13
00:00:34,504 --> 00:00:37,484
-真可悲  -对啊  -超可悲的
- Sad. Mm, indeed. - Yeah. - So sad.

14
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:39,794
归我了
Dibs.

15
00:00:43,474 --> 00:00:44,974
各位好呀
What's up, fellas?

16
00:00:45,274 --> 00:00:46,834
你在这儿干嘛  克莱皮克
What are you doing here, Kripke?

17
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:49,354
量一量我的新办公室该装多大的窗帘啊
Ah, measuring my new office for drapes.

18
00:00:49,724 --> 00:00:51,304
这不是你的新办公室
This is not your office.

19
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:52,814
归谁还不一定呢
It hasn't been assigned yet.

20
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:54,284
早在圣诞节派对上
Well, I called dibs at the Christmas party

21
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:55,904
罗斯曼教授试图跟玩具盒里的公仔做爱时
when Professor Rothman tried to have intercourse

22
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:58,014
我就说了这里归我了
with the Toys for Tots collection box.

23
00:00:59,094 --> 00:00:59,924
归你
Dibs?!

24
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,264
咱这儿可是堂堂的大学  不是游乐场
This is a university, not a playground.

25
00:01:02,264 --> 00:01:03,504
办公室可不会因为
Offices are not assigned

26
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,114
谁喊归谁就归谁
because someone called dibs.

27
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:05,934
你刚就喊了
You just called dibs.

28
00:01:05,934 --> 00:01:07,094
闭嘴
Shut it.

29
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:09,774
办公室的分配得根据资历来
Offices are assigned by seniority.

30
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:11,634
我先来的学校
I arrived at the university first.

31
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:13,394
我先来的办公室
I arrived at the office first.

32
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:15,644
我就是传说中的"早起的鸟儿"
I'm the proverbial early bird.

33
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:17,994
诸位
Gentlemen.

34
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,014
罗斯曼教授
Professor Rothman.

35
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:24,794
晚上好
Good evening.

36
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:31,754
真好  现在又开始流行戴帽子了
I'm glad that men are wearing hats again.

37
00:01:33,264 --> 00:01:35,044
真的显得很高贵
They're so distinguished.

38
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:41,554

生活大爆炸  第五季第十七集

47
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:04,727
我有样小东西要送给你
I got you a little something.

48
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,177
小东西
A little something?

49
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,917
哇  这个...
Oh, it...

50
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,877
这也太大了吧
Oh, this is huge.

51
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:14,867
你对我的帮助才叫大呢
What's huge is what you've done for me.

52
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:16,507
别啊  艾米  我从没帮过你什么
Oh, no, Amy, I haven't done anything.

53
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:19,727
不  在认识你之前  我是一个在舞会上坐冷板凳的胆小鬼
No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower.

54
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:20,977
可你看看我现在
But look at me now.

55
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:23,767
就像那种热衷于各种派对的城市潮女
I'm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl.

56
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,297
有闺蜜  有男友
With a posse, a boyfriend

57
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:29,707
还有一个能镇住全场的新蕾丝文胸
and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things.

58
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:32,157
快打开  快打开
Open it. Open it.

59
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:33,537
好吧
Okay.

60
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,207
我想送你一件前所未有的礼物
I wanted to get you something you didn't have.

61
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:48,527
哇
Wow!

62
00:02:48,527 --> 00:02:50,307
我...我不知道该说...
I... I don't know what to...

63
00:02:50,317 --> 00:02:51,767
哇
Wow.

64
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:53,477
你喜欢吗
Do you like it?

65
00:02:53,477 --> 00:02:56,777
我喜不喜欢  哇
Do I like it? Wow.

66
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:59,147
那你准备挂在哪儿呢
So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?

67
00:02:59,147 --> 00:03:01,967
上帝啊  还得挂起来啊  哇
Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow.

68
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:03,967
这个嘛  我还得去找个钩子
Um, you know, I'd have to go get a hook

69
00:03:03,967 --> 00:03:05,607
还有钉子锤子啥的
and nails and a hammer and...

70
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:07,347
-没问题  -瞧
- No problem. - Oh, look.

71
00:03:07,347 --> 00:03:08,447
你都...
You got...

72
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,017
你...你都准备好了  哇
You just... you got it all right there. Wow.

73
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:19,527
找到他了  在洗手间呢
I found him. He's in the bathroom.

74
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:21,667
赛博特校长
President Siebert?

75
00:03:21,967 --> 00:03:22,777
就不能等等吗
Can't this wait?

76
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:25,167
-不好意思  我俩有话要说  -非得现在说吗
- I'm sorry. We just need a word. - Now?

77
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:28,277
你们知道我是老板  而且手里还握着二弟呢吧
You realize I'm your boss, and I am holding my penis?

78
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,687
谢尔顿  咱先出去吧
Sheldon, give the man some privacy.

79
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:35,047
真是不好意思  这家伙简直无法无天了
I'm sorry. This guy's got no respect for boundaries.

80
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:37,007
你们想干嘛
What do you want?

81
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,037
你能亲口告诉这个疯子
Will you tell this lunatic

82
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:40,397
罗斯曼教授的办公室就应该归我吗
that Professor Rothman's office is rightfully mine?

83
00:03:40,397 --> 00:03:42,507
这种事不能找你们系主任商量吗
Can't you take this up with your department chairman?

84
00:03:42,507 --> 00:03:45,277
找过了  他的助理说他在休假
We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical.

85
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:48,977
尽管我们清楚地听见了他办公室窗户的开关声
Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.

86
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,447
二位  我有件要紧事要办
Gentlemen, there's a task I'm trying to accomplish here,

87
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:53,647
可我现在却办不了
and I'm having trouble doing it.

88
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:57,417
天啊  赛博特校长  我不想危言耸听
Oh, my. President Siebert, I don't mean to be an alarmist,

89
00:03:57,417 --> 00:03:59,537
但是排尿困难可能是
but difficulty initiating a urine stream

90
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:03,077
良性前列腺增生的症状
could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

91
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,527
如果您感兴趣
If you're interested,

92
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:06,477
我可以发给您一个YouTube视频地址
I can send you a link to a YouTube video

93
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:09,377
它会告诉您如何自己进行直肠检查
that'll show you how to perform your own rectal exam.

94
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:13,967
小贴士  记得先剪指甲哦
Uh, helpful hint-- trim your nails first.

95
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:17,607
别理他  赛博特校长
Ignore him, President Siebert.

96
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,387
我相信像您这样的青壮年一定有一个非常...
I'm sure a young man such as yourself has a perfectly...

97
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:21,427
健康的前列腺
healthy prostate.

98
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,887
他在拍您的马屁呢[字面为"给您上黄油"]
Oh, he's just trying to butter you up.

99
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:24,817
顺带告诉您
And for the record,

100
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,797
黄油可是直肠检查的最佳润滑剂
butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam.

101
00:04:28,647 --> 00:04:31,657
二位  我现在允许你俩自行解决这个问题
Gentlemen, I'm going to allow the two of you to work this out

102
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:33,887
因为  第一  你俩都是优秀的科学家
because A. you're both brilliant scientists,

103
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,377
第二  至于罗斯曼的办公室归谁
B. as far as who gets Rothman's office,

104
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:39,027
我他妈一点都不在乎
I couldn't give the furry crack of a rat's behind.

105
00:04:44,107 --> 00:04:46,177
既然我们都来了
Well, as long as we're here,

106
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:47,677
我也放个水好了
I might as well take a leak.

107
00:04:50,877 --> 00:04:51,997
克莱皮克
Kripke?

108
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:52,837
怎么了
Yes?

109
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:54,457
那是我的专用尿池
You're in my spot.

110
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:14,137
这画真大
That is big.

111
00:05:15,257 --> 00:05:16,587
超大
So big.

112
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:18,267
画得好丑
And ugly.

113
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,727
超丑
So ugly.

114
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,527
我该怎么办
What am I gonna do?

115
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:23,327
我不知道
I don't know.

116
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,027
你不可以拿下来  艾米会伤心的
You can't take it down. You'll break her heart.

117
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,747
看看那张脸
Look at that face.

118
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:32,277
那张让人心烦又抓狂的大脸
That enormous, unsettling, crazy face.

119
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,887
你说有没有可能  我会慢慢喜欢上这幅画
Is there any chance I'll learn to love it?

120
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:38,407
看情况
That depends.

121
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:41,407
你会喜欢把你画得像个爷们的画像吗
Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?

122
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,437
好吧  把它撤下来
Allright, it's got to go.

123
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:47,177
那你回头怎么跟艾米说
What will you tell Amy?

124
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:48,647
不如我告诉她
How about I tell her

125
00:05:48,647 --> 00:05:50,317
这画没有把你画进去
the painting makes you feel jealous

126
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,437
让你嫉妒到抓狂
because you're not in it?

127
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:54,027
不要  万一她也送一幅给我怎么办
Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one?

128
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,697
我已经有张我和霍华德妈妈在威尼斯海滩
I already have a picture of me and Howard's mom

129
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:00,597
双双顶着满头小辫子的合影了
getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach.

130
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,197
我已经够遭罪了
I've suffered enough.

131
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:04,487
或者我可以先拿下来
Well, I guess I could take it down

132
00:06:04,487 --> 00:06:07,117
等她过来时再挂上去  但这画好重
and put it up when she comes over, but it's kind of heavy.

133
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:10,287
可惜你不像画中的男人婆那么壮
Oh, too bad you're not as strong as the dude in the painting.

134
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:15,847
看看这个
Would you look at this?

135
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:18,107
我花了二十五块跟易趣上一个小孩
I paid $25 to some kid on eBay

136
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:19,947
买了这根手工制作的哈利・波特魔杖
for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand.

137
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,737
结果他给我寄来根树枝
He sent me a stick.

138
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,217
是他在自家后院捡的一根小树枝
He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick.

139
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,467
上面有编号
It's numbered.

140
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:34,957
还是限量版的呢  太棒了
Limited edition. Nice.

141
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:38,297
应该是克莱皮克
Oh, that'll be Kripke.

142
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:39,317
他来这干嘛
What's he doing here?

143
00:06:39,317 --> 00:06:42,017
我们准备像绅士一样解决办公室归谁
We're going to work this office situation out like gentlemen.

144
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:45,097
要是这样还不行  我就在他的茶里下毒
And if that doesn't work, I'm going to poison his tea.

145
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,937
-库珀  -克莱皮克  请进
- Cooper. - Kripke. Come in.

146
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,587
我正在泡茶
I'm making tea.

147
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:52,927
要来一杯吗
Would you like a cup?

148
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,607
我像穿着连衣裙的娘儿们吗
Am I wearing a summer frock?

149
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,457
不  哥不喝茶
No, I don't want tea.

150
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,437
我们直接谈正事吧
Let's get down to brass tacks.

151
00:06:59,647 --> 00:07:03,357
好吧  为了保护咱俩的友谊...
Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendship...

152
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,697
咱俩不是朋友
We're not friends.

153
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:07,967
这话有点伤人  不过好吧
Well, that's a little hard to hear, but all right.

154
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:13,127
众所周知  外交的本质就是妥协
As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise.

155
00:07:13,127 --> 00:07:14,167
以该本质为指导思想
With that in mind,

156
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,927
我提出如下建议
I propose the following.

157
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,497
罗斯曼的办公室归我
I will take Rothman's office,

158
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:22,117
你一边哭去吧
and you will find a way to be okay with that.

159
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,767
不如这样  罗斯曼的办公室归我
How about I take Rothman's office,

160
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,697
而你滚一边凉快去
and you go suck a lemon?

161
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,887
你确定不用我给你倒杯茶吗
You sure I can't get you that cup of tea?

162
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,037
不如你们这样
How about you decide this

163
00:07:40,037 --> 00:07:42,657
用"石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克"来决定
with Rock-Paper-Scissors Lizard-Spock?

164
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,247
这他妈又是什么
What the frig is that?

165
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:49,537
"石头剪刀布蜥蜴史波克"
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock

166
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,067
是由互联网先驱萨姆・卡斯发明的
was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass

167
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,897
是对经典游戏"石头剪刀布"的改进
as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors.

168
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:56,547
萨姆・卡斯万岁
All hail Sam Kass.

169
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:57,787
万岁
Hail.

170
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:00,437
怎么玩的
How does it work?

171
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,917
非常简单
Oh, it's very simple.

172
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,637
剪刀剪布  布包石头
Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock,

173
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:07,537
石头砸死蜥蜴  蜥蜴毒死史波克

174
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,867
史波克踩碎剪刀  剪刀斩首蜥蜴
Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard,

175
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,867
蜥蜴吃掉纸[同义布]  论文[布]证明史波克不存在
lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock,

176
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,677
史波克使石头蒸发
Spock vaporizes rock,

177
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,547
最后和以前一样  石头砸坏剪刀
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

178
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,187
抱歉  再说一遍好吗
I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

179
00:08:26,617 --> 00:08:27,327
当然
Well, of course.

180
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,807
剪刀剪布  布包石头

181
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:32,037
石头砸死蜥蜴  蜥蜴毒死史波克

186
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,917
最后和以前一样  石头砸坏剪刀
and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.

187
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,617
差不多明白了  再说一遍吧
Almost got it. One more time.

188
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,867
没问题  剪刀剪布  布包石头  石头...
Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock...

189
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,397
谢尔顿  闭嘴
Sheldon, stop.

190
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,277
他摆明在耍你
He's screwing with you.

191
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:53,327
真的吗
Is he?

192
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,937
那好吧
Well, then,

193
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,047
看来谈判陷入僵局了
it seems we have reached an impasse.

194
00:08:57,047 --> 00:09:00,247
除了跟你决斗  我别无选择了
I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel.

195
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:01,737
我本该把手套甩你脸上的
I'd smack you with a glove,

196
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:01,737
中世纪欧洲骑士挑战时把手套扔向对方
对方捡起就表示接受挑战

197
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:04,407
可上周我刚把冬天的衣物收了起来
but just last week, I packed away my winter things.

198
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:07,447
现在都21世纪了
It's the 21st century.

199
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,477
不能随便决斗
You can't have a duel.

200
00:09:08,477 --> 00:09:10,537
等一下  霍华德
H-Hang on, Howard.

201
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,527
巴里  你枪法有多好
Barry, how good of a shot are you?

202
00:09:16,837 --> 00:09:19,317
不是用手枪  是用脑子
Not pistols. Minds.

203
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:20,567
我们举行知识问答竞赛
A trivia contest,

204
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,457
你来选择知识范围好了
and you may choose the field of battle.

205
00:09:22,457 --> 00:09:23,517
是选择《星际迷航》知识问答
Star Trek trivia,

206
00:09:23,517 --> 00:09:25,637
还是《星际迷航:下一代》知识问答

209
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:31,357

or model trains.

210
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,917
在知识问答方面你有完全优势
You have a complete advantage in trivia.

211
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:36,157
你过目不忘
You have an eidetic memory.

212
00:09:36,157 --> 00:09:37,737
再加上  我好久没看《星际迷航》了
Plus, I haven't watched Star Trek

213
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,877
自从发现我家附近的脱衣舞俱乐部
since I discovered the strip club near my apartment

214
00:09:39,877 --> 00:09:41,397
有免费自助餐后就没看过了
has a free buffet.

215
00:09:43,677 --> 00:09:44,727
要找到你俩同时擅长的事情
It's gonna be hard to find something

216
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,547
实在是困难啊
you're both equally good at.

217
00:09:46,547 --> 00:09:48,827
那你们俩都不擅长的是什么
Is there anything you're both equally bad at?

218
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:50,397
运动
Sports.

219
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:55,654
好吧  一对一
All right, this is one-on-one.

220
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:58,484
谁先投中五个  办公室就归谁  有问题吗
First person to five wins the office. Any questions?

221
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,474
谢尔顿  请说
Yes, Sheldon.

222
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,764
五个什么
Five what?

223
00:10:02,994 --> 00:10:04,574
投中五个球
Balls in the basket.

224
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:22,744
这算出界了吧
It's out, right?

225
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,564
暂停
Time.

226
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,024
空间不够了
Ran out of room.

227
00:10:38,684 --> 00:10:39,834
还记得以前学校的恶霸
You know all those terrible things

228
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,214
是怎么欺负我们的吗
bullies used to do to us?

229
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,224
记得
Yeah.

230
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:43,974
我明白原因了
I get it.

231
00:10:55,414 --> 00:10:56,684
喂
Hey!

232
00:10:57,064 --> 00:10:58,474
他故意拿球砸我
He did that on purpose!

233
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,594
不  他没有
No, he didn't.

234
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,794
他要是故意的才砸不中你呢
Nothing that's happening here is being done on purpose.

235
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,064
好了  别来一对一了
Okay, uh, forget one-on-one.

236
00:11:06,064 --> 00:11:08,314
这次来自由投球
Let's try a free throw contest.

237
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:11,314
谁的球先碰到篮筐  办公室就归谁
First person who makes a basket wins the office.

238
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:13,304
这样太简单了  霍夫斯塔德
Making it too easy there, Hofstadter.

239
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:15,104
鬼才信
No. No, I'm not.

240
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,754
原力  谢尔顿
Use the force, Sheldon.

241
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:20,754
源自《星球大战》

242
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,474
原力
Use the force.

243
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,514
我需要更多原力
I'm gonna need more force.

244
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:33,694
好了  库珀  你的玻璃心准备碎成渣渣吧
All right, Cooper, prepare to have your heart broken.

245
00:11:38,434 --> 00:11:39,964
那算得分吗
Do I get points for that?

246
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:02,654
好了  已经四十五分钟了
All right, we gave it 45 minutes.

247
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:05,304
玩腻了  我们来点其他的
It's no longer funny. Let's try something else.

248
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:07,884
你有什么建议
What do you propose?

249
00:12:07,884 --> 00:12:09,514
数到三
Uh, on the count of three,

250
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,424
你们一起用力往地上拍球
both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can.

251
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:13,094
谁的球弹得最高  办公室就归谁
The highest bounce wins the office.

252
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:15,094
你死定了  库珀
Oh, you are going down, Cooper.

253
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:16,494
别这么自信  克莱皮克
I don't think so, Kripke.

254
00:12:16,504 --> 00:12:18,814
我可是拍橡皮球的高手
I've bounced many a rubber ball in my day.

255
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:20,774
好了  废话少说
All right, that's enough trash talk.

256
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:26,294
一  二  三
One, two, three.

257
00:12:28,684 --> 00:12:30,164
谢尔顿的弹得更高
Sheldon was higher.

258
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:32,764
恭喜你  谢尔顿  办公室归你了
Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office.

259
00:12:33,114 --> 00:12:35,584
谁才是真正的体育白痴
Who's unsatisfactory in P.E. Now?

260
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:46,704
这电影真棒
Oh, what a great movie.

261
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,204
真敢相信你没看过《火爆浪子》
I cannot believe you've never seen Grease.

262
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:50,784
我妈妈不让我看
My mother didn't allow me to watch it.

263
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:53,044
她担心我看了会加入黑帮
She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.

264
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,654
我得走了
I've got to go.

265
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,034
明天我还得早起
I've got to get up early.

266
00:12:58,034 --> 00:12:59,614
我们公司在测试一种
My company's testing a new steroid

267
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,344
据说不会让睾丸缩水的新类固醇
that supposedly doesn't shrink testicles,

268
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:03,784
最晚上班的人要负责测量睾丸的工作
and the last one there has to do the measuring.

269
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,474
那我差不多也要走了
I guess I should get going, too.

270
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:10,694
晚安  画里的佩妮
Good night, painting Penny.

271
00:13:12,094 --> 00:13:13,644
晚安  真的佩妮
Good night, real Penny.

272
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:16,194
晚安  真的艾米
Good night, real Amy.

273
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,924
你不用对画里的艾米说再见
You don't have to say good night to painting Amy,

274
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,614
因为她一直都在
'cause she's never leaving.

275
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:25,574
晚安  真的佩妮
Good night, real Penny.

276
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:26,834
拜
Bye.

277

晚安  异装癖佩妮
Good night, transvestite Penny.

278
00:13:33,064 --> 00:13:36,184
好了  我要把你拿下来
Okay. Let us take you off the wall.

279
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:41,084
眼不见  心不烦
Out of sight, out of mind.

280
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:43,414
真的就好了
I wish.

281
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:47,964
我能借那部电影吗
You know, can I borrow that movie?

282
00:13:47,964 --> 00:13:50,734
那些唱歌的小流氓真的让我春心荡漾
Those singing hooligans really got my motor running.

283
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:53,444
当然  你拿去看吧
Sure, sure. Enjoy.

284
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:55,684
我是说  看完了再还给我  或者...
I mean, get it back to me when you can, or...

285
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:56,964
实际上  送给你好了
you know what, actually, you keep it.

286
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:58,354
就当是我给你的礼物
It's just going to be my gift to you.

287
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,594
-谢谢  -拜
- Thank you. - Bye.

288
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:02,274
等等  那幅画呢
Wait... Where'd the painting go?

289
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,024
在那里
It's right over there.

290
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,034
为什么
Why?

291
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,764
我不知道  那画感觉很怪
I have no idea. That is weird.

292
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:14,084
-你讨厌它  -没有
- You hate it. - No.

293
00:14:14,084 --> 00:14:17,054
没有没有  只是它太大了
No, no. It's just, it's a little big.

294
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,114
-我觉得自己好傻  -没有  你不傻
- I feel like an idiot. - No, come on, you're not an idiot.

295
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,624
帮我把它挂回去吧
Look, just help me put it back up.

296
00:14:20,624 --> 00:14:22,714
为什么  好等我走了你再拿下来吗
Why? So you can just take it down when I leave?

297
00:14:22,714 --> 00:14:25,434
-我不需要你可怜我  -艾米  别这样
- I don't need your pity. - Oh, Amy, come on...

298
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:27,694
真庆幸我没做成雕塑
I'm just glad I didn't go for the sculpture.

299
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:35,024
战利品
Ah, the spoils.

300
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:37,194
终于知道为什么胜者喜欢战利品了
I see why Victors love them.

301
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:39,664
我真为你高兴  谢尔顿
I'm happy for you, Sheldon.

302
00:14:39,674 --> 00:14:42,934
同时我也承认  我会怀念和你共享一间办公室的日子
But I have to admit I'm going to miss sharing an office with you.

303
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,164
那是当然
Oh, of course you are.

304
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:46,304
随时欢迎你来看我
Feel free to drop by any time.

305
00:14:46,304 --> 00:14:48,194
-谢谢  -记得先打电话哦
- Thank you. - Yeah. Call first.

306
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:56,744
你好
Oh. Hello.

307
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:00,054
罗斯曼教授
Professor Rothman.

308
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,844
这已经不是你的办公室了
This isn't your office anymore.

309
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,254
你退休了
You're retired.

310
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:07,694
你应该说  "我看不见你"
I think the word you're looking for is... "Invisible."

311
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:15,174
我来向你道歉
I came to say I'm sorry.

312
00:15:15,174 --> 00:15:16,254
不用了
Don't bother.

313
00:15:16,254 --> 00:15:19,014
-艾米  别这样  -我太受打击了
- Oh, Amy, please. - I'm so humiliated.

314
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,704
我坐在那里看《火爆浪子》的时候
I sat there the whole time that we were watching "Grease,"

315
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:22,994
-还以为你喜欢那幅画呢  -我知道
- thinking you liked the painting. - I know.

316
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:25,104
我从电影的开题
I was a fool from "Summer Lovin'" To the very last

317
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,154
傻到电影的结尾
"Rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong."

318
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:30,644
你说的没错  一点没错
You're right. You're absolutely right.

319
00:15:30,644 --> 00:15:31,844
我应该对你说实话
I should have been honest with you

320
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:34,454
我该跟你坦白这礼实在太重了
and told you the gift was too much.

321
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:36,074
没错  太重
Yes, too much.

322
00:15:36,074 --> 00:15:38,384
因为咱俩的友谊根本不对等
Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical.

323
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,634
显然  我喜欢你多过你喜欢我
I clearly like you more than you like me.

324
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,504
人与人之间的感情
I don't think you can put a number on

325
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:44,944
不能用数字来衡量
how much one person likes another.

326
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,494
我送了你一幅十二平方英尺的油画
I bought you a painting that's 12 square feet in area.

327
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:48,774
这就是数字
There's a number.

328
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,594
艾米  拜托...
Amy, come on...

329
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:52,184
你要是不喜欢用英尺作单位  我可以换成美元
If you don't like feet, you can try dollars.

330
00:15:52,194 --> 00:15:54,104
这幅画花了我三千美元
The painting set me back three grand.

331
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:57,594
三千...  我的天
Three gr... Oh, my God!

332
00:15:58,804 --> 00:16:00,104
艾米
Look, look, Amy,

333
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:02,794
记住  你一直都是我的朋友
all you need to know is, you are my friend

334
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,864
我不想失去你
and I don't want to lose you out of my life.

335
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,034
抱歉  现在你说话我可不敢相信
I'm sorry, I'm just having trouble believing you right now.

336
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,254
拿上锤子  咱们走
Grab your hammer.

337
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,314
没用  心已经碎成渣了
No. Damage is done.

338
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:18,574
好吧  本来我不想说的
Okay, look, I didn't want to say this,

339
00:16:18,574 --> 00:16:21,644
但我把画摘下来的真正原因是...
but the real reason I took the painting down was...

340
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:24,884
伯纳黛特一看见  就嫉妒得牙痒痒
because it made Bernadette very jealous.

341
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,284
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness,

342
00:16:28,284 --> 00:16:30,684
我怎么就没注意到呢
how could I have not seen that?

343
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:31,444
这幅画简直就是
The painting is

344
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:33,524
在不停地提醒她  咱们三人中
a constant reminder that of the three of us,

345
00:16:33,524 --> 00:16:35,424
就她最逊
she is the least cool.

346
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:40,484
对  没...没错...所以...
Yeah, that's... that's what it is, so...

347
00:16:40,784 --> 00:16:42,124
你真是太善良了
You have such a good heart.

348
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,684
是啊...我尽力而为
Yeah... I try.

349
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:46,164
走
Come on.

350
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:47,884
咱们要去哪儿
Whoa, whoa, where are we going?

351
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,514
去把这幅画挂回你家墙上
We're going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.

352
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:51,544
-那伯纳黛特怎么办  -管她呢
- Well, what about Bernadette? - Oh, screw her.

353
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,484
带她玩就算给她天大的面子了
She's just lucky we let her hang out with us.

354
00:17:17,224 --> 00:17:18,414
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

355
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:20,574
我在努力提升这屋的温度
I'm trying to raise the temperature in here

356
00:17:20,574 --> 00:17:22,664
太凉了  我激凸得都要扎破衬衫了
before my nipples tear through my shirt.

357
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:27,034
把空调调高点不就行了
Why don't you just turn up the thermostat?

358
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:28,404
问得好
Aha! Good question.

359
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:30,934
我发现我新办公室的空调开关
It turns out the thermostat for my new office

360
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:33,324
不在这个屋  对  在隔壁屋
isn't in my new office. No. It's next door,

361
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,304
达文波特教授的办公室里
in Professor Davenport's office,

362
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:39,124
而她正经受着更年期一波又一波的潮热
who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause.

363
00:17:40,634 --> 00:17:42,154
这里怎么有个洞
Why is there a hole here?

364
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:44,254
我新办公室为什么会有个洞呢
Why is there a hole in my new office?

365
00:17:44,254 --> 00:17:46,444
我排除到只剩2种可能性
I've narrowed it down to two possibilities:

366
00:17:46,444 --> 00:17:48,344
一种可能是墙里有什么东西
"There was something in the wall

367
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:50,544
而墙外有人想得到
that someone outside the wall wanted,"

368
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:52,094
另一种更让人心烦
or the more disturbing,

369
00:17:52,094 --> 00:17:55,104
就是墙里有什么东西想出来
"There was something in the wall that wanted out."

370
00:17:56,584 --> 00:17:58,744
好吧  至少你终于有可以打开的窗户了
Well, at least you finally got a window that opens.

371
00:17:58,754 --> 00:17:59,424
多好啊
That's nice.

372
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,544
是吗  请听
Is it? Listen.

373
00:18:03,594 --> 00:18:04,614
怎么了  难道你不喜欢风铃吗
What, you don't like wind chimes?

374
00:18:04,614 --> 00:18:06,524
不喜欢  讨厌死了  而且还有更糟的呢
No, I hate them, but it gets worse.

375
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:12,884
-听到了吧  -你是说鸟叫吗
- There it is. - The bird?

376
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,744
跟风铃声完全不搭
It's completely out of tune with the wind chimes.

377
00:18:16,764 --> 00:18:17,464
那又如何
So?

378
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,644
你还没明白吗
You don't get it, do you?

379
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:19,774
窗外那是只知更鸟
That's a mockingbird.

380
00:18:19,774 --> 00:18:21,944
这种鸟啼声婉转曲调多变
Mockingbirds can change their song,

381
00:18:21,944 --> 00:18:24,424
也就是说它唱跑调是故意的
which means he's out of tune on purpose.

382
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:26,834
它故意气我
He's mocking me.

383
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:30,674
天啊  又来了  你们感觉到了吗
Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?

384
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,054
渐渐感觉到你是个
The growing realization

385
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:33,934
性格古怪的王八蛋吗  我们感觉到了
that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.

386
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:36,604
才不是呢  我是说这个振动
No. The vibration.

387
00:18:36,604 --> 00:18:38,944
这办公室正好在地质实验室下面
We are directly underneath the geology lab,

388
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:41,324
他们又开了那个讨厌的振动筛
and they're running their confounded sieve shakers again.

389
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:42,434
喂  你们这些石猴子
Hey, gravel monkeys,

390
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:45,394
想筛石头  直接用自己脑袋摇着筛吧
if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!

391
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:47,764
谢尔顿  淡定
Sheldon, relax.

392
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:49,074
你让我怎么淡定
How can I relax?

393
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:51,004
我的神经系统紧绷得就像竖琴弦
My nervous system is being stretched out

394
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:54,694
被这些事不停拨弄  墙洞  小鸟
like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds

395
00:18:54,694 --> 00:18:57,174
风声  还有那个总亮出他下垂的蛋蛋
and wind and the low-hanging scrotum

396
00:18:57,174 --> 00:18:59,394
整天阴魂不散的罗斯曼教授
of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.

397
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:02,114
你要是这么不开心
If you're not happy,

398
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,264
干嘛不把办公室给克莱皮克
why don't you just let Kripke have the office?

399
00:19:04,264 --> 00:19:05,474
难不成把革命成果拱手相让
Wait, and let him win?

400
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:07,284
你觉得我疯了吗
Do I look crazy to you?

401
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:09,044
我们楼下还要思考呢
We're trying to think down here,

402
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:11,644
你们这帮研究石头的技工
you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!

403
00:19:11,934 --> 00:19:13,184
还有你...
And you...

404
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,704
C调  D调  E调  G调  还有A调
the notes are C, D, E, G and A.

405
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:18,574
挑一个好好唱  不然我就砍了你的树
You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!

406
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:25,655
怎么样
How's that?

407
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,235
右边再高点
Little higher on the right.

408
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,075
-行吗  -再高点
- Now? - Little more.

409
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:31,475
别动了  就这样
No. That's got it.

410
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:36,945
对  好  挺...挺好
Yeah, okay. That's, uh, that's good.

411
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:40,315
告诉你个小秘密
I'll let you in on a little secret.

412
00:19:40,695 --> 00:19:42,805
一开始画的咱俩是裸体的
Originally we were painted nude.

413
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,855
但是我让画家填上衣服了
But I had him add clothes, 'cause I thought

414
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:55,495
我觉得没必要发掘咱们的同性恋潜质
it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality.

415
00:19:57,755 --> 00:19:58,925
没错  改得好
Yeah, good call.

416
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:01,635
不过  你要是改主意了
But if you ever change your mind, all it would take

417
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,515
只需来点温肥皂水和几块海绵[共浴]
is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges.

418
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:08,975
-你是说洗掉画上的衣服吗  -当然
- You're talking about the painting, right? - Sure.

419
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:17,235
救命  来人救命啊
Help! Somebody help!

420
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:21,915
这是怎么回事
What happened?

421
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:25,475
我想看看洞里有什么  结果脑袋卡住了
I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.

422
00:20:26,615 --> 00:20:27,845
你为什么非要看啊
Why would you do that?

423
00:20:27,845 --> 00:20:30,575
这叫对科学的探索精神
It's called scientific curiosity!

424
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:33,195
快去给我弄点黄油
Now go get butter.

425
00:20:34,475 --> 00:20:35,385
挺住
Hang in there.

426
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,995
我马上回来
I'll be right back.
