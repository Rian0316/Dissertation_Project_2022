1
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,470
then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong.

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,380
Yes, well, if we lived in a world

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,290
where slow-moving xenon produced light,

6
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,340
then you'd be correct.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,960
Also, pigs would fly,

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,410
my derriere would produce cotton candy,

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,180
and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic.

10
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,180

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,340
Oh, you're so arrogant.

12
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,330
If you were a superhero,

13
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,060
your name would be Captain Arrogant.

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,070
And you know what your superpower would be?

15
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,730
Arrogance.

16
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,800
You're wrong again.

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,580
If my superpower were arrogance,

18
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,440
my name would be Dr. Arroganto.

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,220
I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.

20
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,430
Yeah, it's like if Alien and Predator decided

21
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,780
to go partners in a Jamba Juice.

22
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,780

23
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,520
Has it occurred to you you're missing the big picture?

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,500
- If you look at neutron scattering data...  - Oh, Penny?

25
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
- Penny?  - What's up?

26
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,640
Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,260
No, no, no.

28
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,210
He won. Suck it up.

29
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:00,480
Well, I'd ask you guys if you want dessert,

30
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,390
but I know Sheldon doesn't eat dessert on Tuesdays.

31
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,210
And even if Raj wanted something, he couldn't tell me.

32
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,320
Howard won't order anything,

33
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,910
involving the words pie or cheesecake.

35
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,360
And Leonard's lactose intolerant,

36
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,500
so he can't eat anything here

37
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,490
without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal.

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,130
Hang on a second.

39
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,710
I could have the fruit platter.

40
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,730
You want the fruit platter?

41
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,080
- Does it have melon on it?  - Yeah.

42
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,860
No, I can't eat melon.

43
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,330
Oh, Howard, heads up.

44
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,930
Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift.

45
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,680
When was the last time you saw her?

46
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,100
Oh, not since we broke up.

47
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,000
Wow. How am I going to play this?

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,980
Sophisticated and relaxed?

49
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,540
Friendly, noncommittal?

50
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,140
Cold and distant?

51
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,580
Hi, guys.

52
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,470
Hello.

53
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,550
I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.

54
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,290
It's one of his best moves.

55
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,820
So, my dear, we meet again.

56
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,440
Hello, Howard.

57
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,920
I've missed you.

58
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,150
I've missed you, Katee Sackhoff.

59
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,150

60
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,200
- One question.  - Anything.

61
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,810
Why am I wearing my Battlestar Galactica flight suit in bed?

62
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,250
Why are you in bed with me?

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,610
If we start to question this, it all falls apart.

64
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,990
Sorry.

65
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,020
Oh, ravish me, Howard.

66
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,320
My loins ache for you.

67
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,410
Okay, if you insist.

68
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,710
Howard, have you seen my girdle?!

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,080
No, Ma!

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,660
I can't find it, and I'm late for my Weight Watchers meeting!

71
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,510
Maybe it committed suicide!

72
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,230
Leave me alone!

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,890
Now, where were we?

74
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:35,690
I believe you were about

75
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,440
to rip off my uniform with your teeth.

76
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,940
Bernadette?!

77
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,510
What are you doing here?

78
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,340
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say I'm here

79
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,010
because you saw me earlier this evening,

80
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,310
and you're still hung up on me.

81
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,690
No, I'm not.

82
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,360
Clearly you are.

83
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,070
Otherwise, based on past experience,

84
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,420
we'd be done by now.

85
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,640
Okay, I'm a little confused here.

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,480
Oh, my. Can I help?

87
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,910
Not that kind of confused.

88
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,550
What's George Takei doing here?

89
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,550

90
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,190
Howard, do you have latent homosexual tendencies?

91
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,910
No, of course not.

92
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,620
So you say.

93
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,230
Yet, here I am.

94
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,350
George, let me ask you something.

95
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,590
How did you deal with being typecast as a science fiction icon?

96
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,700
It's difficult.

97
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,800
You try and stretch as an actor--

98
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,690
do Strindberg, O'Neill,

99
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,960
but all they want is, "Course laid in, Captain."

100
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:37,200
Tell me about it.

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,440
It's frackin' frustrating.

102
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,840
Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?

103
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,020
She's leaving because you really want to be with me.

104
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,880
Howard, I found my girdle!

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,060
It was in the dryer!

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,220
Great, Ma!

107
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,700
I think it shrunk!

108
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,750
I'm spilling out like the Pillsbury Doughboy here!

109
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,750

110
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,140
And with that mental picture,

111
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,940
I think we're done for the evening.

112
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,800
You never told me what happened between you and Bernadette.

113
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,390
I did a stupid thing.

114
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,240
Yeah, I guessed that.

115
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:20,540
It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.

116
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,640
That covers anything from farting in bed

117
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,820
to killing a homeless guy.

118
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,430
Oh, my God.

119
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,670
You ran over a hobo.

120
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,580
No. Stop asking.

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,700
All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her,

122
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,100
but you're too ashamed to face her

123
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,470
because of whatever it is you did.

124
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,760
- In a nutshell. - Okay.

125
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,680
Well, how about this?

126
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,440
Kidnap Bernadette from the opera

127
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,650

128
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,650
wearing a creepy mask so she doesn't know it's you.

129
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,030
Now, you see, I don't know if you're kidding or not.

130
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,220
You're being unreasonable.

131
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,080
Why can't I have a desk?!

132
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,380
Our collaboration is a work of the mind.

133
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,200
We don't need desks.

134
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,380
You have a desk.

135
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,000
- Correct. - But I can't have one.

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,740
You're two for two.

137
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,070
Why can't he have a desk, Sheldon?

138
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,700
Oh, Lord, will this day never end?

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,900
As I've explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali,

140
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,750
whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him

141
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,070
when it's convenient.

142
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,960
There's absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture.

143
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,590
Oh, but there's money for a drawer full of Red Vines,

144
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,380
a marshmallow shooting rifle,

145
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,200
and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?

146
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,360
Yes.

147
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,300
Okay, what if he buys his own desk?

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,510
Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?

149
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,110
- That's ridiculous. - Why?

150
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,040
Because...

151
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,570
Yes?

152
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,860
It's my office.

153
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,570
- Sheldon. - All right, all right.

154
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,830
He can buy his own desk.

155
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,360
And I can put it in your office?

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,170
Well, you really want to dot the I's and cross the T's, don't you?

157
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,310
Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?

158
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,840
They do some of their best work at night.

159
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,300
Ah, it's okay.

160
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,680
Penny?

161
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,510
Penny?

162
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,620
Penny?

163
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,110
Penny?

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,370
Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?

165
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,130
Not since I found out

166
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,130
the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.

167
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,510
I just have a question.

168
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,070
Does Bernadette ever talk about me?

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,080
Oh, absolutely.

170
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,210
- She does? - Yeah, sure.

171
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,340
Just yesterday, she asked,

172
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,640
"Why is Howard hiding under the table?"

173
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,180
She saw that, huh?

174
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,220
Oh, no, not at first.

175
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,500
Right after I pointed it out.

176
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,890
Let me ask you something else.

177
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,450
Is she seeing anybody?

178
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,130
Oh, not that I know of.

179
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,220
Hey, while we're on the subject,

180
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,880
why did you guys break up anyway?

181
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,900
Oh, I'd rather not say.

182
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,160
Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.

183
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,600
But it's embarrassing...

184
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,920
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on. Spill.

185
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,910
Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?

186
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,740
Um, the online game? Sure.

187
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,740
Well, did you know

188
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,160
that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?

189
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,630
Oh, God. I think I see where this is going.

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,060
Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

191
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,600
Bernadette walked in on me

192
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,230
while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.

193
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,050
Oh, you're right. That is so embarrassing.

194
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,140
Would you talk to her?

195
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,330
Bernadette or the troll?

196
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,780
Bernadette. She was so mad at me,

197
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,920
she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.

198
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,180
Well, what was your side?

199
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,350
Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman.

200
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,750
I mean, she could've been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey.

201
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,270
Really? And that didn't make her feel better?

202
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,820
Will you talk to her, see if there's any chance at all

203
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,640
we could get back together?

204
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,850
Oh, gee, Howard, I really don't want to get in the middle of this.

205
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,700
No. Why would you?

206
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,500
I'm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother,

207
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,510
trying to find any scrap of happiness he can.

208
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,380
You know, maybe to make up for

209
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,100
the fact that his dad left him when he was 11.

210
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,830
Okay, I will think about it.

211
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,440
You know, I've always blamed myself

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,870
for him leaving.

213
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,280
I always thought it was because I wasn't the son he wanted.

214
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,480
Yeah, I said I'd think about it.

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
I wasn't athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly...

216
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,380
Okay, fine. Look, look, I'm calling her now! See?!

217
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,820
Thank you.

218
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,350
So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette,

219
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,990
and she did,

220
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,630
and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee.

221
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,190
- One question.  - Yeah?

222
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:50,670
Why on earth are you telling me all this?

223
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,780
I don't know.

224
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,410
Sometimes your movements are so lifelike,

225
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,060
I forget you're not a real boy.

226
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,740
You said I could buy a desk.

227
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,290
This isn't a desk.

228
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,510
This is a... Brobdingnagian monstrosity.

229
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,960
Is that the American idiom for "Giant, big-ass desk"?

230
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,700
It's actually British.

231
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,840
Can you say it again for me?

232
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,640
Brobdingnagian.

233
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,650
One more time?

234
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,670
Brobdingnagian.

235
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,130
Now three times fast?

236
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,190
Brobdingnagian, Brobdingna...

237
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,350
How did you even get it in here?

238
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,630
That's for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know

239
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,230
and you to find out.

240
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,910
All right, you've made your point.

241
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,190
A fine prank, very amusing.

242
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:05,220
Now get it out.

243
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,320
- No.  - Yes.

244
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,200
- No.  - Yes.

245
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,240
- No.  - Yes!

246
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,860
I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon--

247
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,040
I can do this all day.

248
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,900
All right, if you're not going to remove it,

249
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,410
I'll remove it for you.

250
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,560
Knock yourself out.

251
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,180
Help me move my desk.

252
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,210
- No.  - Yes.

253
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,180
- No.  - Yes.

254
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,300
No. It's too Brobdingnagian.

255
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,880
Why do you even want this here?

256
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,230
Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.

257
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,200
Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off,

258
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,580
I'd say it's spot-on.

259
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,230
All right, I see what's going on.

260
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,910
This is the opening salvo in what will be

261
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:01,220
an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges.

262
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,440
Well titted.

263
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,340
Thank you.

264
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,200
Stand by for my upcoming tat.

265
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,890
Hey, Sheldon?

266
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,770
Yes?

267
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,760
No.

268
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,680
See what I did there? I turned it around.

269
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,100
Sorry, I had to clock out.

270
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,880
Oh, no, that's okay.

271
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,870
How have you been?

272
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,230
Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?

273
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,440
Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer,

274
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,140
but it turns out I'm terrified of the ocean.

275
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,440
Too bad.

276
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,100
You wouldn't know anybody

277
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,500
who wants to buy a wet suit, boy's large?

278
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,960
Yeah, forget it. Not important.

279
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,160
So, are you seeing anyone?

280
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,890
- Well, to be honest, I...  - Hey, how are we doing over here?

281
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,810
Can I get you something to drink?

282
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,570
- Not for me, thanks.  - I'm okay.

283
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,790
Are you gonna want to order food?

284
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,610
- Maybe later.  - Okay.

285
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,690
So, are you seeing anybody?

286
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,350
No.

287
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,010
That's what I told him when he asked me.

288
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,250
I hope that's not out of line.

289
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,310
- No, it's fine.  - Penny, can we have a little privacy?

290
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,710
Oh. I'm sorry.

291
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,950
What about you, have you been seeing anybody?

292
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,300
Well, you know how it is with guys.

293
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,530
I mean, we have needs and...

294
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,190
So you've been seeing other girls?

295
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,380
Well, not real girls.

296
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,620
Does that mean slutty trolls?

297
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,010
You know, you look thirsty.

298
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,940
- I brought you some iced tea.  - Thank you.

299
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,150
It's passion fruit, new on the menu.

300
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,830
- I know. I work here.  - Oh, sorry.

301
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,390
Yeah, you're right. Doy.

302
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,170
So, Howard, trolls yay or nay?

303
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,860
Isn't there somewhere else you can be?

304
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,930
Not where I can hear you guys.

305
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,660
Okay, fine.

306
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,260
I'll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet

307
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,890
where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones.

308
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,260
The only reason I go there,

309
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,810
the only reason I've ever gone there

310
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,780
is because I don't have a real woman in my life.

311
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,770
- You happy? - Yeah, that'll hold me for a while.

312
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,040
Howard, you did have a real woman.

313
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,760
I was right there in the next room

314
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,000
while you were clicking that troll's brains out.

315
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,540
Yeah, but we weren't...

316
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,500
I-I mean, you and I never...

317
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,580
Had sex?

318
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,300
Yeah.

319
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,490
Well, whose fault was that?

320
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,940
Complimentary nachos!

321
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,120
You enjoy.

322
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,240
Never had sex?

323
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,250
What do you mean, whose fault was that?

324
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,630
Well, we could've been having sex,

325
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,360
but you never made the move.

326
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,650
I didn't think you wanted me to make the move.

327
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,380
Howard, a girl doesn't go out with a man like you,

328
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,660
with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants

329
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,890
if she's not expecting him to eventually make the move.

330
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,260
Really?

331
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,820
Really.

332
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,310
Son of a bitch.

333
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,180
Hey, this is a little awkward,

334
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,140
but my manager says I can't actually give nachos away.

335
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,290
So... just take that when you're ready.

336
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,930
Yeah, we had a really great talk,

337
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,030
and we're gonna start seeing each other again.

338
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,750
Oh, congratulations.

339
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,930
Have you broken it to the troll yet?

340
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,400
Did Penny tell you about that?

341
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,720
No. Steve Patterson told me.

342
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,470
The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?

343
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,110
- Yeah. - How'd he know about it?

344
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,980
He's Glissinda the troll.

345
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,390
Sorry, dude, the thermostat's on my side of the room,

346
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,080
so it stays Mumbai hot in here

347
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,500
until you turn off that stupid Indian music!

348
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,060
I'll turn off the music

349
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,640
when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!

350
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,280
Oh, too bad! Sheldon's pathologically afraid of birds!

351
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,490
Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!

352
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,000
That's it! Prepare for marshmallow death!

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,850
Eat flaming Nerf!

354
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,210
So anyway...

355
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,520
That's great news about you and Bernadette.

356
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,170
Yeah. I think I'm gonna take her to miniature golf.

357
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:18,240
Ah. I guess for you guys that's like regular golf.

358
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,580
Short jokes? Really?

359
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,700
You're, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me.

360
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,610
Yeah, and don't you forget it.

361
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,500
I had a good time.

362
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,120
Me, too.

363
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,910
Kiss her good night.

364
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,860
All right, now a little tongue.

365
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,010
Hold on there.

366
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,420
We've only just rekindled the romance.

367
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,980
Let's not sully the moment with the exchange of saliva.

368
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,360
Don't listen to him.

369
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,770
She wants it.

370
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,920
Tongue.

371
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,660
See?

372
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,070
Now make the move.

373
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,720
Too soon.

374
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,580
Trust me, she's ready.

375
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,790
Make the move.

376
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,200
No, no, no.

377
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,130
A lady wants to be wooed,courted slowly.

378
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,990
How would you know?

379
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,740
I read.

380
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,220
Listen to me, Howard, it's time.

381
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,140
Make the move, now.

382
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,520
What are you doing?

383
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,600
You said... well, the "Move," Remember?

384
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,950
Oh, not now.

385
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,280
We're starting a new relationship.

386
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,380
I need to get to know you again.

387
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,510
No, you don't.

388
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,770
It's me.

389
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,410
The lusty charmer with the fancy patter

390
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,110
and the hoochie pants.

391
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,360
Be patient; we'll get there.

392
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,040
Told you.

393
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,860
Oh, God, what's that smell?

394
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,200
Yes?

395
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,780
What are you doing in there?

396
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,410
I'm making hydrogen sulfide and ammonia gas.

397
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,020
Just a little experiment in pest control.

398
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,830
It's not gonna work, dude; I grew up in India--

399
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,010
an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street,

400
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,110
and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement.

401
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,140
Well, we'll just see how long you can hold out.

402
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,180
Well, we'll just see how your noxious gas

403
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,000
fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles.

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,070
Didn't you say you're making hydrogen sulfide gas?

405
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,090
- Yes. - Isn't that flammable?

406
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,350
Highly.

407
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,680
Oh, dear.

408
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,970
This is not over.
