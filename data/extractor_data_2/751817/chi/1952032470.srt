4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
两害相权

5
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,885
真让人忍无可忍
It's absolutely intolerable.

6
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:50,285
是 大臣     当然 大臣
Yes, Minister. Quite so, Minister.

7
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:55,927
本来那些部门零敲碎打 各买各的文字处理设备
Each department about to order different word-processing equipment,

8
00:00:56,095 --> 00:01:02,443
是我说服他们 由行政部出面下团购订单
and I persuaded them to place one big central order for everyone

9
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:07,484
金额大到能让英国厂家投资开发新设备
big enough for UK manufacturers to invest in systems development.

10
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:10,044
是 大臣     跟你们说也是白说
Yes, Minister. I don't have to tell you.

11
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:11,694
是白说 大臣
No, Minister.

12
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:16,212
谈判几个月 眼看就能发布特大新闻
Months of negotiation and we were nere a press announcement:

13
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:19,572
"哈克大力投资现代科技"
"Hacker's massive investment in modern technology."

14
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:22,613
"吉姆的国民工业信任票"
"Jim's vote of confidence in British industry."

15
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:25,289
"英国制造能行 吉姆说"
"'Britain can make it,' says Jim."

16
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:27,013
当然 大臣     是 大臣
Quite so.

17
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:32,090
布鲁塞尔突然发出指令 叫欧共体成员
And now this directive from Brussels saying all EEC members

18
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:36,453
全体遵循那些麻烦的欧洲标准
must conform to some niggling European word-processing standards

19
00:01:36,615 --> 00:01:40,813
必须赞成欧共体委员会的计划
that we have to agree to the plans of committees

20
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:45,526
还要开欧洲文字处理设备大会 在布鲁塞尔
at the forthcoming Word-Processing Conference in Brussels.

21
00:01:46,615 --> 00:01:48,890
哎 说话啊
Well, say something!

22
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,050
是 大臣     当然
Yes, Minister. Quite so.

23
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,728
就这样?
Is that all?

24
00:01:55,895 --> 00:02:00,810
大臣 恐怕我们假装欧洲人 总得受点惩罚
That's the penalty we pay for pretending we're Europeans.

25
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:03,443
我完全明白您对欧洲的敌意
I fully understand your hostility to Europe.

26
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:07,893
我不像你 汉弗莱 我是亲欧洲 反欧共体
I'm not like you, Humphrey. I'm pro-Europe, just anti-Brussels.

27
00:02:08,055 --> 00:02:11,127
有时我觉得你倒是反欧洲 亲欧共体
I sometimes think you're anti-Europe and pro-Brussels.

28
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:13,889
大臣 我既不亲谁 也不反谁
I'm neither pronor antianything.

29
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:18,845
我只是卑微的社会公器 盛放您深思熟虑的果实
I'm merely a humble vessel for the fruits of your deliberations

30
00:02:19,015 --> 00:02:23,611
但可以看出 考虑到大欧洲理念的荒谬
It could be argued that given the absurdity of the idea,

31
00:02:23,775 --> 00:02:27,211
欧盟已尽力辩不可辩之理
that Brussels does its best to defend the indefensible

32
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:31,493
行不可行之事     话不能这么说 汉弗莱
and make the unworkable work. That's not true, Humphrey!

33
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,933
不是我浮夸 靠着欧洲理念
Without sounding pompous

34
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,933
我们才能超越狭隘的国家利益
we must avoid narrow national self-interest.

35
00:02:36,095 --> 00:02:38,404
一点都不浮夸     很好
It doesn't sound pompous... Good.

36
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,167
只是不准确罢了
Merely inaccurate.

37
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,050
听好了 卑微的社会公器
Listen, humble vessel,

38
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:48,049
欧洲各国本是一体 致力于同一个目标
Europe is a community of nations dedicated towards one goal.

39
00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:51,806
什么这么好笑 汉弗莱?
May we share the joke?

40
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,284
大臣 我们客观地来看
Minister, let's look at this objectively.

41
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:59,210
这是各国利益的博弈场 我们为什么加入?
It's a game played for national interests. Why did we go in?

42
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:02,287
为了加强自由西方国家的联盟
To strengthen the free Western nations.

43
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:06,767
大臣 是为了离间德法 从而压倒法国
We went in to screw the French, splitting them from the Germans.

44
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:12,534
那法国呢?     为保护他们没用的农民免遭竞争
Why did the French? Protect their farmers from competition.

45
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:16,847
德国不是吧?     他们是为洗清种族灭绝的罪名
And the Germans? To cleanse themselves of genocide

46
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:19,893
请求重新加入人类社会
and apply for re-admission to the human race.

47
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:22,250
这也太尖酸刻薄了
I've never heard such cynicism!

48
00:03:22,415 --> 00:03:25,088
那些小国总不是为自身利益吧?
The small nations didn't join for selfish reasons.

49
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:28,247
是吗? 卢森堡是为了赏钱
Really? Luxembourg is in it for the perks.

50
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:32,203
作为欧共体首都 外国资金滚滚而来
The EEC capital, all that foreign money pouring in.

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,172
他们本来就在中心位置
A sensible central location.

52
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,771
总部在布鲁塞尔 议会在斯特拉斯堡?
Administration in Brussels and Parliament in Strasbourg?

53
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:40,568
大臣 这就像把下院设在大西北
Minister! It's like having the Commons in Swindon

54
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:43,168
公务员放在中南部
the Civil Service in Kettering!

55
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,565
这么说 别的国家又图什么?     比如?
Why do other nations try to get in?

56
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,765
想想希腊
Take the Greeks...

57
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:55,044
我想不通希腊 尽管我对外国人一向很开明
Difficult to take the Greeks openminded as I am about foreigners

58
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:59,485
他们要什么? 橄榄山和松香酒湖
They'll want an olive mountain and a retsina lake.

59
00:03:59,655 --> 00:04:01,452
我不信这些
I don't accept this!

60
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:05,847
对不起 大臣 您有些好朋友是希腊人?
I'm sorry. I suppose some of your best friends are Greeks?

61
00:04:06,015 --> 00:04:07,494
很好笑
Very droll.

62
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,692
欧共体的问题不在国际合作 而在官僚主义
The problem isn't internationalism but too much bureaucracy.

63
00:04:11,855 --> 00:04:15,211
可官僚主义正是国际合作的后果
The bureaucracy is a consequence of the internationalism.

64
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,969
不然为什么一名英国总长
Why else is there an English Commissioner,

65
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:23,926
下设一名法国主任 再往下又是一名意大利科长?
a French Director below him, an Italian Chef-du-Division?

66
00:04:24,095 --> 00:04:27,167
我同意     这是巴别塔     我同意
It's like the Tower of Babel. I agree.

67
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:29,610
或者简直是联合国     我同意
Like the United Nations. I agree.

68
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:32,926
能插句嘴吗? 你们俩是不是彼此都同意?
If I may interject? You are in fact in agreement.

69
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:35,290
没那事
No, we're not.

70
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,212
典型欧共体官员什么样? 意大利人的组织能力
A Common Market official has the organising of the Italians,

71
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:45,288
德国人的弹性 法国人的谦逊
the flexibility of the Germans, the modesty of the French,

72
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:48,731
再加比利时人的想象力 荷兰人的慷慨
the imagination of the Belgians, the generosity of the Dutch

73
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,011
还有爱尔兰人的智力水平
and the intelligence of the Irish!

74
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:54,133
而且还是个保险箱     怎么讲?
It's all a gravy train! How do you mean?

75
00:04:54,295 --> 00:05:00,006
喝香槟 吃鱼子酱 公家豪华轿车 私人飞机
Live on champagne and caviar, Mercedes, private aeroplanes.

76
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,175
个个都伸嘴在食槽里拱
Every official has his snout in the trough

77
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:05,807
大多数人连前蹄也伸了进去
most of them their trotters as well!

78
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:11,925
抱歉我不同意 布鲁塞尔的人都是辛劳的公仆
Brussels is full of hard-working public servants

79
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:15,167
他们整日奔波 忍受无聊的招待
enduring exhausting travel and tedious entertainment.

80
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:19,851
是无聊哦 干掉那么多熏鲑鱼 灌进那么多香槟酒
Working their way through smoked salmon and all that champagne

81
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:26,123
大臣 反正错不在他们     怎么讲?
You're blaming the wrong people. What do you mean?

82
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:32,484
是您某位内阁同僚把团购计划捅到欧共体
One of your Cabinet colleagues warned Brussels of your plan

83
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:35,488
所以指令才来得这么快
which is why the directive appeared so quickly.

84
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:40,969
内阁同僚? 不用说 又是那个死科贝
Cabinet colleagues? Don't tell me! Bloody Corbett again!

85
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:45,965
每当想到科贝 我都替犹大喊冤
When I think of Corbett, I warm to Judas Iscariot!

86
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:51,446
对 确实是工商大臣捅的
Yes, it was the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

87
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:57,804
那个背信弃义 刚愎自用 好大喜功的小人
Treacherous, disloyal, arrogant publicity-seeking creep!

88
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,485
对不起 说得太难听了
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.

89
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:02,800
正相反 大臣
No, Minister

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,528
比起他常任秘书的评价 您这算赞歌了
Compared to what his Secretary says that's a generous tribute.

91
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,894
他怎么做到的?     谁知道?
How did he do it? Who knows?

92
00:06:10,055 --> 00:06:11,773
晚报上有 大臣
The evening paper, Minister.

93
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:15,928
每当科贝靠近 我都觉得背后挨了一刀
Whenever Corbett comes near me I feel stabbing pains in the back

94
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,484
干吗给我这个 伯纳?
Why did you give me this, Bernard?

95
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,725
在这里     哦
Just there. Oh, yes.

96
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:24,126
天啊 内阁改组
Good God! Cabinet reshuffle!

97
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,968
"有消息称 首相将宣布内阁重大变动"
"It's rumoured that the PM will announce Cabinet changes

98
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,603
"就在本次会议期间"
"before the end of the present session."

99
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:36,368
我怎么不知道? 他们怎么知道? 真的假的?
Why didn't I know about this? How do they know? Is this true?

100
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:41,450
大臣 我只是一介公务员 不参与这种高层变动
I'm a humble civil servant, do not move in such exalted circles

101
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:43,890
不像内阁大臣和记者
as Cabinet Ministers and journalists.

102
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,364
确实是真的?     真的
But is it true? Yes.

103
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,491
你怎么知道 你不是不参与么?
How do you know?

104
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:51,885
我是说 真的有这个消息
I mean, it's true that it's rumoured.

105
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:57,531
内阁改组 我才刚开始着手我的...我们的...
Cabinet reshuffle I've hardly started the things that I...we...

106
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:00,448
也许不会动您 大臣
Perhaps you won't be moved, Minister.

107
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:05,131
不动的话 我的事业也就不会前进了
Ah... If I'm not, it means my career isn't moving forward

108
00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:08,128
至少它不会倒退
At least it's not moving backwards.

109
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:12,766
倒退? 你不是说...天啊 可我...
Backwards? You don't mean...? Good God! But I...

110
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:18,214
该不会...会不会...我干的还不错吧?
It's not... I mean, it's... I've been doing all right, haven't I?

111
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,333
我们还不错吧?     您干的不错
We've done all right? You've done all right.

112
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,168
我们还不错吧 伯纳?     是 大臣
We've done all right? Yes, Minister.

113
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:29,363
就算我称不上功臣 可也不算失败
I may not be the outstanding success, but I'm not a failure.

114
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,404
大臣 您干的不错     其实我挺成功的
You've done all right. I've been quite successful.

115
00:07:35,295 --> 00:07:40,164
如果马丁去财政部 我可能调去管外交部
If Martin were moved to Treasury, I could get Foreign Office!

116
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,567
可能吧
Perhaps you might.

117
00:07:46,735 --> 00:07:49,044
你也拿不准啊     拿不准
You don't sound very certain. I'm not.

118
00:07:49,215 --> 00:07:53,094
你有什么消息?     没消息 所以我才拿不准
What have you heard? Nothing, it's why I'm not certain.

119
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:57,407
卡弗怎么知道?     也许他说话首相听得入耳
Why does Bob Carver know? Perhaps he has the PM's ear.

120
00:07:57,575 --> 00:08:01,966
首相把他揣在兜里     首相的耳朵还真长
He's in the PM's pocket. Then the PM must have a large ear.

121
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:08,164
好 这事咱们先不操心     好 大臣
Right, well... Let's not worry about it any more.

122
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:16,965
放下不谈了     是 大臣 我是说不谈了
We'll say no more about it. Yes, Minister. I mean, no, Minister.

123
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:20,127
急也是干着急 对吧?
There's no point worrying about it, is there?

124
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:25,849
根本就没什么可急的吧?     是 大臣
Nothing to worry about, is there? No, Minister.

125
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,485
好吧大臣 参加布鲁塞尔大会吗? 我觉得应该去
Shall we attend the Brussels conference? We should.

126
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:31,850
可如果首相要调动弗雷德...
But if the PM should move Fred...?

127
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,529
参不参加布鲁塞尔大会?
Shall we attend the conference in Brussels?

128
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:38,244
什么会?     文字处理设备
What? Word-processing.

129
00:08:38,415 --> 00:08:42,772
哦 改组之前还是之后开?
Ah! Well, does it take place before or after the reshuffle?

130
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:47,725
谁知道?     算了 我听过这种事
Who can say? Well, no. I've known this happen before.

131
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,808
今天你不在其位 明天就不在位了
One day you're out of your office the next you're out of office.

132
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,170
这不是出国乱转的时候
This is no time for an idiotic foreign junket!

133
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:58,328
大臣 您不能为改组提心吊胆
Minister, you mustn't allow the reshuffle to prey on your mind.

134
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:00,725
我才没有提心吊胆
It's not preying on my mind.

135
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:04,693
我根本就不想它了     太好了
I'm not thinking any more about it. Splendid.

136
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:09,531
伯纳 6点来改组院...洗牌院...下院见我
Meet me at 6 o'clock in the House of shuffles...cards...Commons

137
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:18,448
晚上好 汉弗莱爵士     晚上好 少校
Good evening, Sir Humphrey. Good evening, Major.

138
00:09:20,855 --> 00:09:24,404
阿诺德 改组的事几时能定?
Arnold, when will we know about the reshuffle?

139
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:26,486
还得等一阵
A little while yet.

140
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,771
我们部有什么消息吗?
Any news yet about my department?

141
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,646
得了 汉弗莱 我只是内阁秘书
I'm only Cabinet Secretary

142
00:09:31,646 --> 00:09:34,646
又不是旗帜报政治通讯员
not political correspondent of the New Standard.

143
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:38,169
对我的大臣评价如何?
But how does my Minister stand?

144
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:41,452
首相似乎认为他干的不错
I think the PM feels he's done all right.

145
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:45,085
不过有个动向很有意思
But there's been an interesting development.

146
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,723
嗯?     嗯...
Mmm? Mmm.

147
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,445
啊
Aahh!

148
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:54,652
什么?
What?

149
00:09:55,975 --> 00:10:01,095
布鲁塞尔问他有没有空担任下届总长 只要他愿意
Brussels have asked if he'd be available for commissionership

150
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,564
他总归是亲欧洲派嘛
After all, he's a good European.

151
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:06,169
当然这都属于机密
In strict confidence, of course.

152
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:08,485
是要给他和平免职吗?
Is he being gently eased out?

153
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,566
汉弗莱爵士 阿诺德爵士
Sir Humphrey, Sir Arnold.

154
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,044
你来了 伯纳
There you are, Bernard.

155
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,968
好 喝杯咖啡如何 伯纳?
Right. Would you like a coffee, Bernard?

156
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,603
谢谢     一起坐坐 来杯咖啡
Thank you. Pull up a chair.

157
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:26,404
伯纳 换个大臣你觉得怎样?
Well, Bernard, how do you feel about having a new Minister?

158
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:29,772
你是说他...     不 汉弗莱爵士是在假设
You mean, he's... No, Sir Humphrey is conjecturing.

159
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,847
当然 我会很遗憾的
Ah, of course, I'd be very sorry.

160
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:38,409
怎么了 你不会吗?
Er... Why? Wouldn't you?

161
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:40,767
当然不会
Of course not!

162
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:43,608
可他开始拿得起工作了啊     正是
But he's getting a grip on the job. Exactly!

163
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:46,812
拿得起工作的大臣是祸害
Ministers with a grip on the job are a nuisance.

164
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:49,535
会提出争论     大臣都争论
They argue. All Ministers argue.

165
00:10:49,695 --> 00:10:55,133
拿得起工作才危险 他们可能是对的
There's a real danger they'll be right.

166
00:10:56,575 --> 00:11:00,807
你告诉他们这事不可能 他们会挖出过去的报告
One tells them something is impossible, they dig out an old paper

167
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:04,206
里头你写着这事很好办 真无聊
in which one had said it was easy very tedious.

168
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:08,891
把他们送走 你就可以彻底清盘 从头调教新人
Once they've gone, one can start with a new boy.

169
00:11:09,055 --> 00:11:12,889
改组真是一件盛事 首相也喜欢
Wonderful things, reshuffles. And Prime Ministers like them too.

170
00:11:13,055 --> 00:11:16,411
干净利落 赶着大家团团转
Fresh, decisive, keeps everyone on the hop.

171
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:18,486
只有大臣们最慌张
Only Ministers panic about them.

172
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,969
有意思 能不能让大臣固定不动
Wouldn't it be interesting if Ministers were fixed

173
00:11:22,135 --> 00:11:24,524
常任秘书改来改去?
and Permanent Secretaries were shuffled around.

174
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:34,768
那样的话 伯纳 会给整个体制致命一击
That, Bernard, would strike at the very heart of the system

175
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:38,211
直至动摇不列颠的国本
that has made Britain what she is today.

176
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:40,286
天长地久才是权力
Power goes with permanence.

177
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:44,243
变幻无常让人无力     轮流上台等于阉割
Impermanence is impotence. Rotation is castration.

178
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:46,406
是该让他们轮上一轮了
It's time they all had a little spin.

179
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,889
没错 可民主要求...
Yes, but surely in a democracy...

180
00:11:50,055 --> 00:11:52,523
谢谢 伯纳 没你事了
Thank you, Bernard, that'll be all.

181
00:11:52,695 --> 00:11:55,607
对 可我的...     谢谢 伯纳
Yes, but I've only... Thank you, Bernard.

182
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,970
好的 谢谢 汉弗莱爵士
Yes, thank you, Sir Humphrey.

183
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,603
晚安 阿诺德爵士
Good night, Sir Arnold.

184
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:11,095
如果你们大臣真去了布鲁塞尔 也别高兴得太早
If he does take Brussels, I wouldn't get out the champagne

185
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:16,885
怎么讲?      关于他的接班人有些风声
What do you mean? There is talk of his possible successor.

186
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,974
谁?
Who?

187
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:23,093
我不知该怎么告诉你 可是...
I don't know how to put this, but, well...

188
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,086
巴希尔・科贝
...Basil Corbett.

189
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:34,528
你怎么了 亲爱的? 吉姆?
What's the matter, darling? Jim?

190
00:12:35,975 --> 00:12:37,931
吉姆     对不起
Jim! I'm sorry.

191
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,644
出什么事了?     没事
Something wrong? No, nothing, really.

192
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,612
肯定有事
Something is.

193
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:46,050
报纸上全是改组的消息
The papers are full of a reshuffle.

194
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:48,285
真的假的?     我不知道
Are they true? I don't know.

195
00:12:48,455 --> 00:12:52,084
怎么 你在内阁啊     内阁总是最后知道
You're in the Cabinet. We're the last to find out.

196
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:54,644
不能问首相吗?     当然不能
Can't you ask the PM? Of course not.

197
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,251
怎么不能?     就是不能
Why not? Well... I just can't.

198
00:12:58,455 --> 00:13:03,051
别人会以为我在发慌呢      这样啊
It would look as if I were insecure. I see.

199
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:07,572
不知是好事还是坏事 不知我要上还是要下
whether it's good or bad news, whether I'm up or down.

200
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:09,373
还是照例原地打转
Or round and round.

201
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:12,891
也不知我算成功还是失败
I don't know whether I'm a success or failure.

202
00:13:13,055 --> 00:13:17,173
你觉得呢?     我觉得你干的不错
What do you think? I think you've done all right.

203
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,965
不错行吗?     我不知道 行吗?
Is that good enough? I don't know.

204
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,684
我不知道 行吗?     我不知道
I don't know, is it? I don't know.

205
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:27,894
说不准 也许首相嫌我太成功
The PM might think I've been too successful.

206
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,410
你知道 威胁到他的权威
You know, a challenge to the leadership.

207
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,167
你?
You?!

208
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:37,890
不是我 是马丁加上我的支持
No, not me, but Martin with my support.

209
00:13:38,055 --> 00:13:41,127
你看 如果首相要铲除异己
If the PM is standing by to repel boarders,

210
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:44,093
又不能安稳地撵走马丁
and Martin can't be got rid of safely

211
00:13:44,255 --> 00:13:48,248
外交大臣确实不好撵走 当然得拿我开刀了
as Foreign Secretary, I'm the obvious one for demotion.

212
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:51,293
孤立马丁     会送你去哪呢?
Isolate Martin. Where would you be sent?

213
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,015
挂名闲差多得是
There's no shortage of useless non-jobs.

214
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:58,248
枢密院长 掌玺大臣 体育部长
Lord President, Lord Privy Seal... Minister of Sport...

215
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:03,570
旱灾涝灾特派员
...with special responsibility for droughts and floods.

216
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,525
没准你会升职呢 亲爱的
Maybe you'll get promotion, darling.

217
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:09,687
也许吧 别忘了巴希尔・科贝
Maybe... Don't forget there's Basil Corbett.

218
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:12,733
他专门跟我过不去     他跟谁都过不去
He's out to get me. To get everyone.

219
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,808
他是个尖牙利齿死鱼眼 两面三刀的小人
He's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed, cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

220
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,205
他为什么这么吃香?
Why's he so successful?

221
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,366
因为他是个尖牙利齿死鱼眼
Because he's a smooth-tongued, hard-nosed,

222
00:14:21,535 --> 00:14:23,446
两面三刀的小人
cold-eyed, two-faced creep.

223
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:26,607
还有呢?     他电视形象不错
Apart from that? He looks OK on TV.

224
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:29,084
你也是啊     是吗?
So do you! Do I?

225
00:14:29,255 --> 00:14:31,723
对     你说真的?
Yes! Really mean that?

226
00:14:31,895 --> 00:14:34,853
对     你太好了
Yes. What a nice thing to say!

227
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,693
我和科贝彼此掣肘 挤来挤去
I've got to elbow Corbett or he'll elbow me.

228
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,813
手肘 政坛上最有力的武器
Elbows, the most important weapon in a politician's armoury.

229
00:14:41,975 --> 00:14:47,129
除了正直之外     正直?
Other than integrity. Integrity?!

230
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:54,814
喂?
Yes?

231
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,604
哪位? 等等 是布鲁塞尔的加斯顿・拉罗
Who's speaking? Hold on. It's Gaston Larousse from Brussels.

232
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,766
布鲁塞尔?
From Brussels?

233
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:06,372
晚上好 专员(法语)...专员
Bonsoir, Commissionaire... Commissar...

234
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,294
对(意大利语)
Si...

235
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:13,891
非常有意思
That's very interesting.

236
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:17,286
请容我考虑一下
I shall need a little time to think about it.

237
00:15:17,455 --> 00:15:19,605
我非常荣幸
I'm very honoured.

238
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:24,929
10号(意大利语)知道你在通知我吗?
Does Numero Dix know you're talking to me about this?

239
00:15:26,655 --> 00:15:28,646
10号
Number 10.

240
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:33,370
唐宁街
Downing Street.

241
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:39,729
这样啊 那你给我留个家里电话
I see... Tell you what, give me your home telephone number.

242
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,253
好
Yes...

243
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:49,407
我会尽快答复你 非常感谢 再见
I'll give you a ring very soon. Thank you very much, goodbye.

244
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,531
什么事?
What was that?

245
00:15:52,695 --> 00:15:55,050
我不知道     什么叫不知道?
I don't know. What do you mean?

246
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:02,288
他们要提名我担任英国驻欧共体专员
They want me as one of Britain's commissioners for the EEC.

247
00:16:05,575 --> 00:16:08,851
什么意思?     搬家去布鲁塞尔呗
What does it mean? Living in Brussels.

248
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:12,128
不不 我是说 这是什么意思?
No, I mean, what does it mean?

249
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:16,527
10号知道了 那就是和平撤我职?
Number 10 knows, so is it a plot to ease me out?

250
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:20,893
是巧合? 是暗示? 究竟什么意思?
Is it just a coincidence? What does it mean? Is it a hint?

251
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:24,013
首相想让我光荣隐退?
Is the PM giving me a face-saving exit?

252
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:27,053
或者跟首相无关 本来就要派我去?
Or was the post coming up anyway?

253
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:30,571
某种方面说...是挺光荣的
It's a great honour... in a way.

254
00:16:30,735 --> 00:16:33,613
这职位怎样?     惨透了
Is it a good job? Terrible.

255
00:16:34,895 --> 00:16:38,205
跟英国政治完全隔绝
It's curtains as far as British politics is concerned.

256
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:43,845
比领爵位还惨 永世不得翻身
It's worse than a peerage. Absolute failure, total failure.

257
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:48,647
要想回来 除非自己建个党
You're reduced to forming a new party if you want to get back.

258
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,404
这工作具体干什么?
What does the job involve?

259
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:56,205
身处恐怖的欧共体官僚中心 进了保险箱
The heart of that ghastly Brussels bureaucracy, the gravy train.

260
00:16:56,375 --> 00:17:00,084
每年薪水5万磅 报销2万磅
50,000 a year salary, 20,000 a year expenses.

261
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:04,774
香槟 龙虾 周游列国 高级酒店
Champagne, lobsters, foreign travel, luxury hotel...

262
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:07,731
豪华轿车 私人飞机
...private limousines, private aircraft...

263
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,810
午休时间
...siestas in the afternoon...

264
00:17:12,535 --> 00:17:15,368
比利时海滩度周末
...long weekends at Knocke-le-Zoute...

265
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,328
我们去看看吧?      好啊
We should go over and have a look. Why not?

266
00:17:20,495 --> 00:17:23,692
偶尔失败一下也不错
Sometimes we deserve a bit of failure.

267
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:29,450
内阁要改组 先生?
Going to be a reshuffle, sir?

268
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,925
对 从旗帜报上看来的吧
Yes, I suppose you saw that in the Standard.

269
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,973
对 先生     我也是
Yes, sir. So did I, actually.

270
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,774
当然 我几个星期前就听说了 先生
I first heard it a couple of weeks ago, sir.

271
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:40,891
是吗?     是 先生
Did you? Yes, sir.

272
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:44,570
其实我也是 听说什么?
So did I, really. Where did you hear it?

273
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,295
司机都知道了     怎么知道的?
All the drivers knew. How?

274
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:49,605
听首相的司机说的
From the PM's driver.

275
00:17:49,775 --> 00:17:52,494
还有内阁秘书的司机     哦 对
The Cabinet Secretary's driver. Oh, yes.

276
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:57,091
还听说什么?     就是那些
What else did they hear? Just the usual.

277
00:17:57,255 --> 00:18:01,692
科贝要提拔了 首相不能再忽略他
Corbett's in line for promotion, PM can't overlook him.

278
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:06,485
显然 老弗雷德...抱歉 是就业大臣
Apparently, old Fred the Employment Secretary, sorry, sir -

279
00:18:06,655 --> 00:18:09,249
他会被明升暗降 踢到上院去
he's going to get kicked upstairs.

280
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:12,930
他们怎么知道?     他换司机了
How do they know? His driver's been re-assigned.

281
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:17,731
关于我有什么消息?
What's the gossip about me?

282
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,363
还真没什么消息 先生
Well, nothing really, sir.

283
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,093
没有?     没有
Nothing? No.

284
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,815
我们都说不出个所以然来
We don't know what to make of that.

285
00:18:24,975 --> 00:18:28,854
您有消息吧 先生?     我当然有
You'll know, won't you, sir? Yes, of course.

286
00:18:29,495 --> 00:18:32,328
不过 当局者迷 旁观者清
Sometimes it's difficult to know about oneself.

287
00:18:32,495 --> 00:18:35,885
就是 我到底有多成功...
You, know, just how successful...

288
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:41,969
你们圈子里...有没有...?
What do your mates say... about...?

289
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:46,333
都说您干的不错 先生
They all think you've done all right, sir.

290
00:18:47,855 --> 00:18:52,371
伯纳 我有点进退两难     我能帮忙吗 大臣?
I'm in a bit of a quandary. Can I help, Minister?

291
00:18:52,535 --> 00:18:55,413
内阁洗牌的事要下注了
It's this reshuffle that's on the cards.

292
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,049
非常巧妙 大臣
That's very witty, Minister!

293
00:19:01,695 --> 00:19:05,973
对不起 我以为您在讲...请继续
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a... Do please carry on.

294
00:19:07,575 --> 00:19:11,887
更麻烦的是 他们请我去做欧共体专员
To complicate matters, I've been asked to be an EEC Commissioner.

295
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:15,172
很好啊     好吗 伯纳? 这就是问题
Very nice. Is it nice, Bernard?

296
00:19:15,335 --> 00:19:19,214
伯纳 你跟我说实话
Bernard, tell me, quite frankly...

297
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:25,364
我在这当大臣 是不是当的不错?
...as Minister here, do you think I've done all right?

298
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,206
是啊大臣 您确实不错
You've done all right.

299
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,054
你看 汉弗莱到处拦我的路
Humphrey's blocked me on so many issues.

300
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:34,490
从来没有诚心诚意站我这边
He's never really been on my side.

301
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:39,012
老实说 "不错"其实不算好吧?
To be honest, "all right" isn't really good enough, is it?

302
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:42,408
这个 它算...不错
Well, it's... all right.

303
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:50,965
你听到...什么小道消息吗?
Have you... er... heard anything... on the grapevine?

304
00:19:51,495 --> 00:19:53,053
关于您?
About you?

305
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,206
没什么消息 大臣
Nothing really, Minister, no.

306
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,606
只说英国驻欧洲专员发了封电报
Only that the British Commissioner in Europe sent a telegram

307
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:01,653
给外交部和内阁欧洲委员会
to the FCO and the Cabinet Committee on Europe.

308
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:05,285
是布鲁塞尔提出请您做专员
The idea for you to be a Commissioner came from Brussels,

309
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,253
但终归得首相任命
but it is a Prime Ministerial appointment.

310
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,966
首相已经跟外交部长和内阁秘书谈过
The PM discussed it with Foreign Secretary and Cabinet Secretary

311
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:16,332
并且同意他们探探您的口风
and cleared the way for you to be sounded out.

312
00:20:16,495 --> 00:20:20,329
首相府和财政部都相信您会接受
As it's believed at Number 10 and Number 11 that you might accept

313
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:24,488
还问了内阁里的某人愿不愿接您的班
a colleague has been sounded out about becoming Minister here.

314
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,930
恐怕我知道的就这些
I'm afraid that's all I know.

315
00:20:29,335 --> 00:20:31,485
没别的了?
No more than that?

316
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:37,005
问谁愿不愿接我的班?
Which colleague has been sounded out to take my place?

317
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:43,444
伯纳 如果我不去欧洲...
Bernard, if I were not to go to Europe...

318
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:48,484
不 如果我去...不 如果我不去
No, if I did go... No, if I were not to go to Europe,

319
00:20:48,655 --> 00:20:52,568
我会升还是降?
would I go up or down?

320
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,813
汉弗莱爵士要来开会了 大臣
Time for your meeting with Sir Humphrey, Minister.

321
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,694
喂 好的     什么事?
Yes, fine. What's it about?

322
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:05,972
去不去文字处理设备大会的事
The visit to the word-processing conference.

323
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,490
文字处理设备大会?
The word-processing conference?

324
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:13,126
汉弗莱 告诉你个好消息 我改主意了
Humphrey, you'll be pleased to hear that I've changed my mind,

325
00:21:13,295 --> 00:21:16,173
我确实应该去布鲁塞尔
I shall be going to Brussels after all.

326
00:21:16,335 --> 00:21:19,691
您要辞掉行政部的职位?
You're resigning from the Department?!

327
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:23,165
不不不 我要参加文字处理设备大会
No, I'm talking about this word-processing conference.

328
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:26,611
这样啊     我还是想去布鲁塞尔转转
I see. I would like to see Brussels.

329
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:29,084
理由呢?     没理由不去
Why? Why not?

330
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:31,769
是没理由不去 可理由呢?
Why not, indeed, but why?

331
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:35,211
我好奇嘛     您是挺好奇的 大臣
I'm a curious person. You certainly are.

332
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:37,605
我昨天言重了
I've been a little hasty.

333
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,847
你对布鲁塞尔的辩护很有说服力
Your arguments on behalf of Brussels were thoroughly convincing.

334
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:44,291
大臣 我又回味了一下您的观点
Minister, I've been reflecting on your views,

335
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:47,492
您对布鲁塞尔的批评非常明智
and I find wisdom in your criticism of Brussels.

336
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:52,046
您暗示的腐败和...     不不不
You implied it is corrupt and... No, no, no.

337
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:54,410
大臣 求您...     不对 汉弗莱
Minister, please... No, Humphrey.

338
00:21:54,575 --> 00:21:57,009
是你说服了我
It is you who have convinced me.

339
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:01,327
我现在相信 布鲁塞尔都是敬业的官员
I'm now convinced that Brussels is full of dedicated men,

340
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:05,966
肩负着四处奔波 公关接待的重担
all bearing a heavy burden of travel and entertainment.

341
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:08,330
奢侈是工作需要
They need all that luxury.

342
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,451
喝喝小酒
The odd drinky!

343
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:14,132
鱼子酱 香槟 私人飞机 豪华轿车?
Caviar and champagne, private planes, air-conditioned Mercedes?

344
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:16,286
这是外交的润滑油
It oils the diplomatic wheels.

345
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:19,291
伸嘴拱食?
Snouts in the trough.

346
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:24,529
别说的这么难听     对不起 真不知我跟谁学的
That's not an attractive phrase I can't think where I picked it up

347
00:22:24,695 --> 00:22:28,085
我们都去布鲁塞尔开会 说定了?
We'll all go to this conference, agreed?

348
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:33,090
大臣 您改主意完全因为我的话?     当然是
Is your change of heart due to my arguments? Of course.

349
00:22:33,255 --> 00:22:38,045
不是因为传说中布鲁塞尔专员的职位?
It's nothing to do with the rumour of your post in Brussels?

350
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,530
汉弗莱 你怎么能这么想
That thought is not worthy of you.

351
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:44,812
世上还有正直这回事
There is such a thing as integrity.

352
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,771
好的 谢谢
Oh, yes, thank you.

353
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:58,004
科贝 你不能让科贝这种人...
Corbett! You can't let someone like Corbett...

354
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,811
不能让科贝这种人管我们部
You simply can't let Corbett loose on the department.

355
00:23:04,975 --> 00:23:08,251
这是灭顶之灾 不管你跟他说什么
It'd be disastrous. Everything one says to Corbett

356
00:23:08,415 --> 00:23:10,929
明天一早准上太阳报
appears in the Sun the next morning.

357
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:14,206
很高兴你还读太阳报 (煽情小报 三版有裸女)
Glad to know you read the Sun.

358
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:18,813
你一定要制止 阿诺德 我求你
You must stop it, Arnold, I implore you.

359
00:23:18,975 --> 00:23:20,931
我又不是首相
I'm not the Prime Minister.

360
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:23,609
可实际控制改组的是你吧
It is really you who arranges the reshuffles.

361
00:23:23,775 --> 00:23:27,484
不 如果首相真决定任命谁
No, if there's an appointment the PM is set on,

362
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:30,215
内阁秘书只能勉为其难地照办
the Cabinet Secretary must reluctantly acquiesce.

363
00:23:31,055 --> 00:23:33,694
大方向上是你掌舵吧
You do keep your hand on the tiller.

364
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,733
如果哈克拒绝欧共体职位
If Hacker decides to turn down Brussels,

365
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:41,524
科贝就不那么容易去你们部
it would be easier to keep Corbett away from your department.

366
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:44,448
问题就在这里 他打算接受欧共体职位
This is the trouble, he'll take Brussels.

367
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:47,611
哦     是啊 我知道
Oh. Yes, I know.

368
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,892
他说他相信大欧洲理念
He says he believes in the European ideal.

369
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,444
对 我知道 我知道
Yes, I know, I know.

370
00:23:54,535 --> 00:23:58,210
政客职业病嘛 会上自己的当
Politicians get taken in by their own speeches.

371
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:04,570
你也有错 汉弗莱 你三天两头泼他冷水
This is partly your fault. You've blocked Hacker time and again.

372
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:08,968
都是为了政府好 阿诺德
Only in the interests of good government, Arnold.

373
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:14,209
那当然 不过你最好让他这两天出点成就
Quite. But what you need is a big success in the next few days.

374
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:16,935
出点成就?     对
A big success? Yes.

375
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,325
就这两天?
The next few days?

376
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:25,211
这样我...首相就有充分理由留下他
That would give me, give the PM a good case for keeping him here.

377
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,129
然后 就好把科贝调到就业部去了
Then, we might be able to move Corbett to Employment.

378
00:24:29,655 --> 00:24:31,771
弗雷德非撤不可吗?
Is Fred definitely going?

379
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,574
对 他老在内阁会议上打瞌睡
Yes, he keeps falling asleep in Cabinet.

380
00:24:36,135 --> 00:24:38,171
我以为他们都打瞌睡
I thought they all did.

381
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,293
对 不过总不至于在说话的时候
Yes, but not while they're actually talking.

382
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:56,172
汉弗莱 有消息吗?     什么消息 大臣?
Ah, Humphrey! Any news? Of what, Minister?

383
00:24:56,335 --> 00:24:58,326
当然是内阁改组     没有
The Cabinet reshuffle. No.

384
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:01,089
你中午不是和内阁秘书吃饭了吗?
Didn't you have lunch with the Cabinet Secretary?

385
00:25:01,255 --> 00:25:03,166
对     有什么结论?
Yes. What came up?

386
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,927
眼下没结论
Nothing as yet!

387
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:09,088
我只知道改组的事周一公布
All I know is the reshuffle will be announced on Monday.

388
00:25:09,255 --> 00:25:11,815
您有消息吗?     什么消息?
Have you any news? Of what?

389
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,610
专员的事 您去不去布鲁塞尔?
The Commissionship. Are you going to Brussels?

390
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,326
这个...
Well...

391
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:22,615
作为议员来说 我觉得不该去
With my Parliamentary hat, I don't think it would be a good idea.

392
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:27,053
不过作为内阁大臣 我觉得应该去
With my Cabinet hat on, it would be a good idea.

393
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:31,766
而作为党派成员 该去也不该去
With my party hat on, there could be arguments on both sides.

394
00:25:31,935 --> 00:25:34,768
懂了 您到底把自个当什么?
Which hat are you talking through now?

395
00:25:35,895 --> 00:25:41,333
您决定要去布鲁塞尔了?     是也不是
Have you decided about going to Brussels? Yes and no.

396
00:25:41,495 --> 00:25:47,172
您在犹豫什么呢 大臣?      我不知道
What are the pros and cons, Minister? I don't know.

397
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:52,528
我以前可能没说过
I haven't said this before,

398
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:57,644
但这取决于我是不是还不错 你们说呢?
but it depends on whether I've done all right. What do you think?

399
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,806
您确实不错
You've done all right.

400
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,648
如果我真的不错 那就错不了
If I've done all right, that's all right,

401
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:05,090
我得留下 结果应该还不错
I shall stay because I'll be all right.

402
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:09,373
可如果我只是不错 留下就错了 没错吧?
But if I've only done all right, to stay would be wrong, right?

403
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,535
大臣 我有个建议
Minister, I have a suggestion

404
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,404
为稳妥起见 您得做出点成就
to be on the safe side, you need a big success.

405
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,805
可不是     大获全胜那种     对
Yes. A triumph, in fact.

406
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:21,127
得提升个人形象 做出一大政绩
You need some publicity for a great political achievement.

407
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:25,288
对对 你有什么主意?     我不知道 我正在想
What have you in mind? I'm trying to think of something.

408
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:28,731
多谢你 帮大忙了 干吗突然要政绩?
Thank you, that's a great help. What's the purpose?

409
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:30,851
午餐时确实有些结论
Something did come up at lunch.

410
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:33,290
阿诺德爵士说有了这么个胜利
Sir Arnold feels that with this triumph,

411
00:26:33,455 --> 00:26:35,571
首相就不好给您降职
the PM couldn't move you downwards,

412
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:39,853
伯纳和我就有幸能把您留在身边
Bernard and I have the good fortune of you staying on with us.

413
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,085
不可能给我升职吗?
So there's no chance of moving up?

414
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,530
哦...
Ooh...

415
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:46,890
可惜啊 大臣 没有
Sadly, Minister, alas.

416
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,933
人还是现实点好     好吧
One must be a realist. Oh, well.

417
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,369
就这么办 我得去布鲁塞尔了
That's it, it's got to be Brussels.

418
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:56,925
且慢 我想到了

419
00:26:57,095 --> 00:27:00,292
如果您不搭理欧共体

还没正式签发 目前只是请求
It hasn't been ratified, it's merely a request.

我们不能对欧洲友邦背后捅刀子 当面吐口水
We can't stab our partners in the back and spit in their face.

什么?
What?

435

I'd have to give up all that...

食槽     对
Trough. Right.

439
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:58,927
事到临头 人总得以本国为重
When it comes down to it, one's own country must come first.

440

尽管严格说来 这不算政府事务 大臣

您走了我个人也会痛惜之至
I, personally, would be deeply sorry to lose you.

是吗 汉弗莱 你说真的?
Really, Humphrey, is that true?

444

千真万确 大臣 绝对是肺腑之言
Yes, I mean that, Minister, most sincerely.

445
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:18,009
你太好了 汉弗莱 我们彼此是有些好感
I suppose we have got fond of one another.

446
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,689
某些方面      某些方面 对
In a way. In a way, yes.

447
00:28:20,855 --> 00:28:23,210
就像恐怖分子和他的人质
Like a terrorist and his hostage.

448
00:28:25,975 --> 00:28:27,613
你们俩谁是恐怖分子?
Which is the terrorist?

449
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,731
他是
He is!

450

告诉我 汉弗莱 如果我走了谁会接班?
Tell me, Humphrey, who would have got my position?

453

我不知道
I don't know...

454
00:28:44,975 --> 00:28:48,206
您不是说是巴希尔・科贝吗?
Didn't you tell me it was Basil Corbett?

455
00:28:49,335 --> 00:28:51,451
巴希尔・科贝?
Basil Corbett?!

456
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:54,775
