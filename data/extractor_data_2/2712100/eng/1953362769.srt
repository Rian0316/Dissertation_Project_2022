00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:04,468
Thanks.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,053
That's weird.
I have a message.

3
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:08,126
That's weird.

4
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:09,461
You still have
an answering machine.

5
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:11,313
(beep)

6
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:12,931
Ted, this is the Captain.

7
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:15,967
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

8
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:19,101
Oh, crap.

NARRATOR:
Kids, you remember the Captain.

12
00:00:33,987 --> 00:00:36,088
<i>He was one of the richest men</i>
<i>in New York,</i>

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,290
<i>and when I met him,</i>
<i>he was married to Zoey,</i>

14
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:41,176
who I ended up... befriending.

15
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:44,263
Oh, man, he seems pissed.
Does he?

16
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:46,215
Yes. Listen.
(beep)

17
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:49,017
Ted, this is the Captain.

18
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:52,721
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

19
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:54,923
Oh, I hear it now.

20
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:56,024
What? I don't know.

21
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:58,009
Listen again.
(beep)

22
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,513
Ted, this is the Captain.

23
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:07,236
Please call me back
at your earliest convenience.

24
00:01:07,238 --> 00:01:08,904
MARSHALL:
<i>He sounds pissed.</i>

25
00:01:08,906 --> 00:01:10,873
Yeah, and I think
I know why.

26
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,158
It has to do
with the last time I saw him.

27
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,794
It was, um... it was, like,
a year and a half ago.

28
00:01:15,796 --> 00:01:18,196
Oh, boy, that was a crazy story.

29
00:01:18,198 --> 00:01:19,798
(chuckling):
Oh, boy, yeah.

30
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,867
I remember.

31
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,918
You weren't there.

32
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,137
Ted, <i>bubbeleh.</i>

33
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:28,039
If you have a crazy story,
I was there.

34
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:29,925
That's just a law
of the universe.

35
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:31,059
So what happened?

36
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:32,427
Well, it was a few weeks

37
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:35,264
after Zoey and I broke up,
and I was on the rebound,

38
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:39,084
and I kind of rekindled things
with that girl, Becky.

39
00:01:39,086 --> 00:01:41,854
Becky?
Boats, boats, boats.

40
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,121
Boats, boats, boats!

41
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:45,474
Boats!

42
00:01:45,476 --> 00:01:47,209
What's this
a commercial for again?

43
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:49,227
I can't quite...

44
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,063
Boats, boats, boats!

45
00:01:52,065 --> 00:01:53,365
Oh, get a room, you two.

46
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,616
TED:
<i>You weren't there.</i>

47
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,234
I was, too.

48
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,337
All right, you were there?
Tell me the story.

49
00:01:58,339 --> 00:01:59,788
I like the way you tell it.

50
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,507
Please, I insist.

51
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:03,342
Okay, we'll tell it together.

52
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:05,260
Okay.

53
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:07,930
Lily...
Lily...

54
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:09,932
had invited us...
...had invited us...

55
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:10,933
...to an art...

56
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,885
...Garfunkel concert.

57
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:14,186
...gallery opening.

58
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,271
An Art Garfunkel
gallery opening concert.

59
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:18,390
Go on, Ted.
You're doing great.

60
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:19,391
Anyway,

61
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,776
I get to the gallery...

62
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:23,278
This place is so fancy.

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,447
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

64
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:26,448
What? Lily, come on.

65
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,983
You got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

66
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:31,102
Dude, look who it is.

67
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,938
And who should walk in but...

68
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,490
Daddy's home.

69
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:37,459
Nope.

70
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,629
Well, well, Ted Mosby,
my old nemesis.

71
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:41,880
What are you doing here?

72
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:44,950
Um, well, uh,
Lily saw an ad for this...

73
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:46,084
Gallery?

74
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,787
So we... we came
to check out the...

75
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:50,255
Artwork.

76
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:52,558
And then we ran into...

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,759
Me.

78
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:55,394
TED:
<i>Man, this guy's so rude.</i>

79
00:02:55,396 --> 00:02:57,462
<i>I mean, I get why he's mad.</i>

80
00:02:57,464 --> 00:03:00,265
<i>I did stick it</i>
<i>to his ex-wife... repeatedly.</i>

81
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,351
<i>Still, he's being a jerk.</i>

82
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:05,020
<i>Someone needs</i>
<i>to bring him down a peg.</i>

83
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,805
I'm sorry. Where are my...

84
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,690
Manners.

85
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,159
That's how that feels.

86
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,411
This is my art
consultant.

87
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:13,946
Shelly.

88
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:15,781
Art consultant? What's that?

89
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:17,366
Oh, Shelly helps the Captain

90
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:19,117
select artwork
based on its aesthetic appeal

91
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:21,336
and value
as an investment.

92
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:23,956
That's why I think
she's gonna love

93
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,490
this elephant painting.

94
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:28,326
I think this artist
is going places.

95
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:29,428
Well, I should go.

96
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,263
Captain, we'll
talk tomorrow?

97
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:32,764
At ease.

98
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,883
Hey, if you like art,

99
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:36,852
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

100
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:39,104
It's in my apartment
just upstairs.

101
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,942
It's gonna blow you away.

102
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:47,229
Anyone with this kind
of ashtray money

103
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,731
probably has an island
where he hunts people.

104
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:51,950
Probably somewhere
in the Caribbean.

105
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:55,120
I bet there's good snorkeling.

106
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,690
Hello, my darling,

107
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:02,127
my one true love, my everything.

108
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,328
So, who wants to see

109
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,963
that painting?

110
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,832
Okay, Captain, we know why

111
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:08,166
you brought us up here.
It's, uh...

112
00:04:08,168 --> 00:04:09,635
it's about me and Zoey.

113
00:04:09,637 --> 00:04:11,003
Ted,

114
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:14,372
if you've got something
to say,

115
00:04:14,374 --> 00:04:16,475
say it.

116
00:04:16,477 --> 00:04:17,676
A harpoon gun?

117
00:04:17,678 --> 00:04:19,728
A double-barreled
harpoon gun.

118
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,430
One barrel.

119
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:22,514
With a scope.

120
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,182
No scope.

121
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:26,268
I know you're upset, Captain,
but I promise you

122
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,686
nothing happened
between me and Zoey

123
00:04:27,688 --> 00:04:29,187
until after you guys
split up, okay?

124
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:30,322
So let's...

125
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:32,858
Let's please,
just-just-just put this down.

126
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,028
Okay? Okay,
oh, there we go.

127
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,396
Look, Ted,

128
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:39,498
I'm not mad at you.

129
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,949
The truth is
I'm in love

130
00:04:40,951 --> 00:04:43,118
with somebody else now,
so we're fine.

131
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,005
Just don't steal this one
from me, too, okay?

132
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:48,790
Okay?

133
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,208
(laughter)
Of course.

134
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,911
I promise.
Okay.

135
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:54,546
But that got me thinking.

136
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:56,214
Who was this new
lady in his life?

137
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:58,917
I-I had this weird
sinking feeling.

138
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:00,352
We both did.

139
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,353
I had to see that picture.

140
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,271
<i>So I waited until everyone</i>

141
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:05,757
was out of the room, and then...

142
00:05:15,318 --> 00:05:16,985
BECKY:
<i>Boats, boats, boats!</i>

143
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:18,236
No.

144
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:21,123
No...!

145
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,909
She's "boats, boats, boats,"
and he's the Captain.

146
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,627
That's sweet;
I'm happy for those two.

147
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,995
Ted, you suck.

148
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,131
(phone rings)

149
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,033
(gasps)
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

150
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:32,634
It's him, it's him.
What do I do?

151
00:05:32,636 --> 00:05:34,136
What do I do?
Ted, wait a second.

152
00:05:34,138 --> 00:05:36,338
What do I do?
Wait a second. Wait a second!

153
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,791
Hey, is there any chance
that he is calling

154
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:42,811
to invite the three of
us out on his boat?

155
00:05:42,813 --> 00:05:45,680
Uh, I don't know,
maybe like one percent.

156
00:05:45,682 --> 00:05:48,299
Ted's phone. Hold for Ted.

157
00:05:49,802 --> 00:05:51,353
Hello.

158
00:05:51,355 --> 00:05:53,021
Ted, I'm gonna
ask you something,

159
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,441
and I want you
to be completely honest.

160
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,111
What's your friend
Robin's number?

161
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:00,495
What?

162
00:06:00,497 --> 00:06:02,664
Ted, ask about the boat.

163
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:09,515
Uh, Captain, can...
can I put you on hold?

164
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:11,014
Affirmative.

165
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:14,586
He wants Robin's number.

166
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,871
Should I give it to him?

167
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:18,173
Is he trying to hook up
with my fiancée?

168
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:19,541
No, uh-uh. (snorts)

169
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:20,775
The only way that's happening

170
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,911
is if I get to hook up
with someone, too.

171
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,513
Wait a second... No.

172
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,781
Unless... Absolutely not.

173
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,216
However... Forget it.

174
00:06:28,218 --> 00:06:29,801
On the other hand... Ixnay!

175
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,938
Guys, guys,
I got to make a decision here.

176
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,806
Okay, you know
what, I say do it.

177
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,057
If it is a booty call,

178
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,526
then Robin will just
let him down easy,

179
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,594
but in the meantime, Ted is back
on the Captain's good side.

180
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:42,030
We all get to go out on his
boat; I get to steer it.

181
00:06:42,032 --> 00:06:43,264
Everybody wins.

182
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,599
Okay.

183
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,701
Fine. Give him her number.

184
00:06:46,703 --> 00:06:48,102
You don't think she'll mind?

185
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,237
I don't think she'll mind.

186
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,223
You gave the Captain my number?

187
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,407
She minds.

188
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:53,942
Do you not remember that night

189
00:06:53,944 --> 00:06:56,611
we hung out with him
at the art show?

190
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:58,046
Oh, right, of course
you don't remember

191
00:06:58,048 --> 00:06:59,247
because,
earlier that night,

192
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:01,249
you shared a big,
fat sandwich with Becky.

193
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:03,785
Boats, boats, boats!

194
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:07,255
What's this
a commercial for again?

195
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:08,423
Yeah, so?

196
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,559
I hardly think that
changes the story.

197
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,394
Mmm. Mmm.

198
00:07:12,396 --> 00:07:13,595
Delicious!

199
00:07:13,597 --> 00:07:16,314
This place is so fancy.

200
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,233
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

201
00:07:18,235 --> 00:07:19,401
Oh, come on, Lily.

202
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:21,302
You got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

203
00:07:24,407 --> 00:07:25,907
Dude, look who's here.

204
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:27,308
Daddy's home.

205
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,613
Nope.
Nope.

206
00:07:31,615 --> 00:07:32,581
Well, well.

207
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,615
(screams)

208
00:07:33,617 --> 00:07:35,250
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.

209
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,451
What are you doing here?

210
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:39,754
Well, Lily...

211
00:07:39,756 --> 00:07:42,707
saw an ad for this...

212
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:48,463
Gallery.

213
00:07:50,266 --> 00:07:52,267
So we thought we'd, um...

214
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:54,469
come and check out the...

215
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,224
Artwork?

216
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,981
And then we ran into...

217
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:10,068
Me?

218
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,020
ROBIN: <i>And the Captain</i>
<i>wasn't glaring at you.</i>

219
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,655
<i>He couldn't take</i>
<i>his eyes off...</i>

220
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:15,189
Hey, nice to see you again.

221
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,408
Yeah, you, too.

222
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,709
Oh.

223
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,995
Man, this guy is so rude.

224
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,463
I mean, I get
why he's upset.

225
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:25,533
I did stick it
to his ex-wife... repeatedly.

226
00:08:25,535 --> 00:08:27,385
Still,

227
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,586
the guy's being a jerk.

228
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:30,922
Someone needs
to take him down a peg.

229
00:08:30,924 --> 00:08:32,724
(clears throat)
Sorry.

230
00:08:32,726 --> 00:08:34,476
Where are my manners?

231
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,811
This is Shelly,
my art consultant.

232
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:38,480
Art consultant?
What's that?

233
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:40,598
Shelly helps the Captain
select artwork

234
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,883
based on aesthetic...

235
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:43,685
Manners!

236
00:08:43,687 --> 00:08:46,271
That's how that feels.

237
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:51,026
...appeal

238
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:53,411
and value
as an investment,

239
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,229
and that's why I think
she's gonna love

240
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,531
this elephant painting.

241
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,784
I think this artist
is going places.

242
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,253
Well, I should go.

243
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:05,290
Captain, we'll
talk tomorrow.

244
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:08,093
If you like art,

245
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,046
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

246
00:09:12,214 --> 00:09:16,718
It's gonna blow you away.

247
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:19,754
Snorkeling.

248
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,773
ROBIN: <i>Then, after I saved you</i>
<i>from destroying</i>

249
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,257
a priceless crystal ashtray...

250
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:25,143
<i>You're welcome.</i>
(screams)

251
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,479
Hello, my darling,

252
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:30,315
my one true love, my everything.

253
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:32,901
Ahoy?

254
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,654
So who wants to see
that painting?

255
00:09:36,656 --> 00:09:38,990
Okay, Captain.

256
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:41,960
We all know why
you brought us up here.

257
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:45,213
This is about me and, um...
(snaps fingers)

258
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,132
Zoey.

259
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:49,334
All right, Ted.

260
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:50,952
If you've got something to say,

261
00:09:50,954 --> 00:09:53,638
say it.

262
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,006
Whoa, whoa.

263
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:56,124
A remote control?

264
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:57,291
A remote control.

265
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,761
Let's relax.

266
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:02,230
I-I know you're upset, Captain.

267
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,265
I-I just...
I want to assure you

268
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,167
nothing happened
between me and Zoey

269
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,269
until after you
guys had split up.

270
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:10,105
So let's just...
let's just...

271
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:11,940
let's put this down.

272
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:15,476
Okay, okay.

273
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,645
There we go.

274
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,616
Ted, I'm not mad at you.

275
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:22,917
Truth is, I'm in love

276
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:25,820
with somebody else now.

277
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,791
So he invited me back
to his bedroom

278
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,876
to show me
this painting, and...

279
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,129
Finally.

280
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:35,630
We're alone.

281
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:37,265
BARNEY:
<i>Robin, no, I don't want</i>

282
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:38,883
to picture that.
Nothing happened.

283
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:41,436
Aw, that means hand stuff.
What?

284
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:42,604
No.

285
00:10:42,606 --> 00:10:44,355
I'm serious--
he was on the rebound.

286
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:48,026
I told him to take some time
to pull himself together and...

287
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:49,861
call me in a year
and a half.

288
00:10:49,863 --> 00:10:51,529
BARNEY:
Ah, great.

289
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:52,864
What if he asks you out?

290
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:55,450
What does that mean
for our relationship?

291
00:10:55,452 --> 00:10:58,536
What, are we planning to be
in some super-enlightened,

292
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:00,288
forward-thinking marriage,

293
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,158
where we don't get hung
up on the suffocating

294
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,577
and outdated principles
of monogamy,

295
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:06,911
and instead enjoy

296
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,580
the company of
multiple partners,

297
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:12,366
sometimes bringing said
partners into our marital bed,

298
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:14,535
but just girls, not dudes,

299
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:16,671
except maybe one time just
to see what that's like?

300
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:19,207
I mean, is that
what you want?

301
00:11:19,892 --> 00:11:21,142
No.

302
00:11:21,144 --> 00:11:23,178
Okay.

303
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Me, neither!

304
00:11:25,182 --> 00:11:27,599
Okay, Robin, look,
you-you need to call the Captain

305
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,068
and let him down easy, okay?

306
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:32,237
Let him move on
with his life.

307
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,389
Let him go out on his boat
with his old friends,

308
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,742
maybe some new friends.

309
00:11:37,744 --> 00:11:41,029
Maybe let one of those
new friends steer the boat.

310
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:44,082
Just so that one
of them could say,

311
00:11:44,084 --> 00:11:47,202
"Iceberg straighthead!"

312
00:11:47,204 --> 00:11:49,204
Fine.

313
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:51,405
(sighs)

314
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:54,042
Ahoy.

315
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:56,410
Hi. Captain, it's Robin.

316
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:57,962
Ahoy.

317
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,514
Uh, look,

318
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:01,432
I, uh, have to be
upfront with you.

319
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm engaged.

320
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:04,919
Engaged? I thought you
were married to Marshall.

321
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:07,105
This is Robin right?

322
00:12:07,107 --> 00:12:08,439
The redheaded
kindergarten teacher

323
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,508
who wore the gray dress
and the blue shoes

324
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,860
to that art show?

325
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:13,561
Can you please
hold a moment?

326
00:12:13,563 --> 00:12:14,896
Dropping anchor.

327
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:18,199
He's looking for Lily.

328
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:20,151
Should I give him
her number?

329
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,620
Yeah. We've already
discussed it.

330
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:24,605
It's $4 million cash.

331
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,658
Oh, her phone number.

332
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,276
Yes, I don't think
she'll mind.

333
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:30,628
You gave the Captain my number?

334
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,881
She minds.
(sighs)

335
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:35,583
It finally happened.

336
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:38,136
My past finally caught up
with me.

337
00:12:38,138 --> 00:12:39,254
Oh, God.

338
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,922
Lily, if you tell me that you

339
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:42,757
slept with the Captain
for anything under 2.8,

340
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:45,293
which we agreed was as low
as we were going to go...

341
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,428
No, it's nothing like that.

342
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,631
Do you guys remember the
last time we saw the Captain?

343
00:12:50,633 --> 00:12:52,066
ALL: Yes.
LILY: Oh, right.

344
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:54,836
Of course you don't.
Barney, you weren't there.

345
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,021
Ted, you had just floated out
of a Snoop Dogg B-side.

346
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,157
And, Robin,
you had just come from that

347
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,276
big meeting that ran long.

348
00:13:05,748 --> 00:13:07,481
(whooping)

349
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:10,151
(imitating drums)
Delicious. Shrimpy for me.

350
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:11,953
This place
is so fancy.

351
00:13:11,955 --> 00:13:14,539
I hope I don't
embarrass myself.

352
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:17,759
Come on, Lily, you have nothing
to be embarrassed about.

353
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:20,795
Dude!

354
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:22,330
Look who's here!

355
00:13:22,332 --> 00:13:23,381
Daddy's...

356
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:25,717
Nope.
Nope.

357
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,485
Well, well.
(Ted shrieking)

358
00:13:27,487 --> 00:13:29,220
Ted Mosby, my old nemesis.

359
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:32,223
Hello, sailor.

360
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,391
ROBIN:
<i>No!</i>

361
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:36,945
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

362
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:39,731
Okay, yeah,
that's what happened.

363
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,150
This is Shelly,
my art consultant.

364
00:13:42,152 --> 00:13:43,117
(scoffs)

365
00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,619
Art consultant!

366
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:46,437
What's that?

367
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,189
Shelly helps the Captain
select artwork

368
00:13:48,191 --> 00:13:50,241
based on its aesthetic appeal

369
00:13:50,243 --> 00:13:52,026
and its value
as an investment,

370
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,495
which is why I think
she's gonna love

371
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,863
this elephant painting.

372
00:13:55,865 --> 00:13:59,584
I think this artist
is going places.

373
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:02,420
You'd have to be a real Dumbo
not to enjoy this painting.

374
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,388
(laughs) Get it?

375
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,922
'Cause he's an elephant?

376
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:08,476
Your sense of humor is as
good as your taste in art.

377
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:10,345
Captain?

378
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:11,712
We'll talk tomorrow?

379
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:14,649
If you like art,

380
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:16,684
you should see the painting
I just acquired.

381
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:17,735
It's in my...

382
00:14:17,737 --> 00:14:19,404
Manners.

383
00:14:19,406 --> 00:14:21,222
That's how that feels.

384
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:27,161
In my apartment right upstairs.

385
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:29,364
It's gonna blow you away.

386
00:14:29,366 --> 00:14:31,582
Snorkeling.

387
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,168
LILY: <i>Then, after I saved you</i>
<i>from destroying</i>

388
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,503
a priceless crystal ashtray...

389
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,954
<i>You're welcome.</i>

390
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,172
(shrieks)

391
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,576
Hello, my darling,
my one true love, my everything.

392
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,850
So, who wants
to see that painting?

393
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,968
Ooh, if you
show me yours,

394
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,421
I'll show you mine.

395
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,423
So we check out the painting.

396
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:57,675
Huh. You know,

397
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,028
that elephant painting
would look nice in here.

398
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,562
You're looking at a masterpiece,

399
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:04,032
and you're talking
about some elephant painting?

400
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:06,984
TED (yelling):
No...!

401
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:10,121
Oh, this one's nice, too.

402
00:15:10,123 --> 00:15:13,157
I just like
the elephant painting better.

403
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,712
You know, it doesn't matter
what you like.

404
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:20,214
You're just
a kindergarten teacher.

405
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:23,718
Ah, finally we're alone.

406
00:15:25,554 --> 00:15:27,088
(giggles)

407
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:31,092
(snoring)

408
00:15:31,094 --> 00:15:33,311
Oh, no, Lily, what did you do?

409
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:35,163
He was a jerk--
he deserved to have

410
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:37,348
that precious painting stolen.

411
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,067
Oh, God, Lily, you didn't...?

412
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,601
Of course I didn't.

413
00:15:41,403 --> 00:15:43,688
I stole this ashtray instead.

414
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:50,432
Lily!
Hey, you know the rules.

415
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,700
You misbehave, I take away
one of your toys.

416
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,418
Aldrin Justice, baby.

417
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,137
So you're telling me
that that ashtray

418
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:58,571
that's been in our apartment

419
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:00,173
for over a year and a half

420
00:16:00,175 --> 00:16:02,459
is not only stolen,
but also very expensive.

421
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,294
Both of those things-- yes.

422
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,796
Guys, can you leave us alone
for a minute, please?

423
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,798
Ooh, they're gonna do it.

424
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,050
No, we're gonna fight.

425
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:13,386
And then maybe afterwards
we'll do it.

426
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,006
I can't believe

427
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,357
that was the same ashtray.

428
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:18,942
I should've recognized it.

429
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,944
I know-- me, too.

430
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,762
Barney, you weren't there.

431
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,264
Why is it so important that
you be part of this story?

432
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,034
Because crazy stories
are my thing.

433
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,486
You have architecture,

434
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,620
Marshall has the law,

435
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,821
Lily has art,

436
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,657
Robin has pleasing
me sexually.

437
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,076
You all have a passion
that drives you.

438
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,944
Well, if I have a passion,
it's taking life

439
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:40,330
and turning it into a
series of crazy stories.

440
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,083
If you can do that
without me, then...

441
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,386
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

442
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:50,924
You know what, Barney?

443
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,426
Now that I think about it,

444
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,794
you were there.

445
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:55,729
That's right, you were.

446
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,763
I was?
Yeah.

447
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,297
I mean, I know I was.

448
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,850
That's what I'm
saying, guys.

449
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:04,604
We just, uh... we just didn't
realize it because...

450
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,406
you were in disguise.

451
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:07,691
Yeah, you were doing, uh,

452
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,409
one of your plays
from the playbook.

453
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:11,578
On Shelly, the art consultant.

454
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,280
Yes, it was, uh, some play
that had to do with art...

455
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,983
The Royal Archduke
of Grand Fenwick?

456
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:18,585
A simple play
you can do

457
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:20,837
using two everyday
household objects--

458
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,155
a Prussian
military costume

459
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,673
and an oil painting
of yourself?

460
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,543
That's the one,
and it worked on Shelly.

461
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,828
I totally nailed her!

462
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,464
And then I nailed her sister
who was even hotter.

463
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:33,049
(laughing)

464
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,185
Good times.

465
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,336
You are gonna return that
ashtray, and you're gonna pray

466
00:17:37,338 --> 00:17:39,439
that he doesn't press charges,
because I can't be

467
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:41,507
in a marriage where
one of us is in prison.

468
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,393
I know that we role-play
conjugal visits a lot,

469
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,395
but I can't do that
for realsies.

470
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,180
I'm sorry--
all rulings are final.

471
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:48,748
I am not taking it back.

472
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,366
Oh, my God!

473
00:17:50,368 --> 00:17:51,451
Lily,

474
00:17:51,453 --> 00:17:53,119
what is the big deal?

475
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,370
Okay, so what?

476
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,372
So he said you're just
a kindergarten teacher.

477
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,907
Why do you let that bother you?

478
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:59,209
Because he was right.

479
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:01,327
I am just
a kindergarten teacher.

480
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:02,962
And, yes,
I have a degree

481
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:05,582
in art history and I was meant
to do something with it,

482
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,833
but I didn't.

483
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,201
Somewhere along
the line,

484
00:18:08,203 --> 00:18:10,804
I forgot to pursue
my dream, and...

485
00:18:10,806 --> 00:18:14,424
and now I'm old and I'm a mom
and it's just too late for me.

486
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,759
Lily, okay, okay.

487
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,376
It's too late.
No, no, no, it's not too...

488
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:18,845
it's not too late.

489
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,730
You're gonna quit
your job tomorrow,

490
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,650
and you're gonna...
you're gonna go back and pick up

491
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,819
right where you left off
with that art stuff.

492
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:27,386
And then you know what?

493
00:18:27,388 --> 00:18:30,607
I'm gonna find Shelly, and I'm
gonna punch her in the face.

494
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,826
I am-- I'm gonna
punch a girl...

495
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:34,727
and run away.

496
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:37,280
Look.

497
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,998
I promise you,

498
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,252
your best
and your most exciting days

499
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:44,420
are all ahead of you.

500
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:49,108
I love you so much
for saying that,

501
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,928
but there gets to be
a point in life

502
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,014
where that just
stops being true.

503
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:59,052
I'm sorry I stole this.

504
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,854
I'll return it
first thing tomorrow.

505
00:19:00,856 --> 00:19:03,273
NARRATOR: <i>And so the next day,</i>
<i>Lily returned</i>

506
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,058
<i>to the Captain's apartment.</i>

507
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,559
Well, how about that.

508
00:19:06,561 --> 00:19:08,394
I didn't even realize
it was gone.

509
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,947
No harm done.

510
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,733
Wait, if you weren't calling
about the ashtray,

511
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,485
then why'd you want to see me?

512
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,870
Follow me.

513
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:22,208
Oh, my gosh.

514
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:24,878
Yep, that night,
I ducked back down

515
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,579
into the gallery and bought it.

516
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:28,281
Shelly didn't stop you?

517
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:31,084
Shelly was off with some
archduke she met at the party.

518
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:33,469
No, I just... well,

519
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:36,005
I liked what you said
about how you just liked it.

520
00:19:36,007 --> 00:19:37,757
I still do.

521
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,893
Me, too.

522
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:41,792
Anyway, I just sold
it for $4 million.

523
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:42,680
What?

524
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,098
In the year and a half
since I bought this piece,

525
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,067
the artist has turned into
a huge star in the art world.

526
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:50,103
The next Basquiat,
they're saying.

527
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,988
And nobody saw it coming
except you.

528
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,608
So I've decided to give you
half my earnings from the sale.

529
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,476
(gasps)
I'm just kidding.

530
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:59,495
I'm not giving you
two million bucks.

531
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:01,647
(groans)
I mean, I could.

532
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,816
Easily-- it wouldn't even
make a dent for me.

533
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,703
But trust me,
the tax code being what it is,

534
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,955
you do not want
to be rich right now.

535
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:10,707
So here's what I'm thinking.

536
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,675
I want to get back
in the art game,

537
00:20:12,677 --> 00:20:15,595
and I need a new art consultant.

538
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,632
Wait, are you offering me a job?

539
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,134
If you want it.

540
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,886
What do you say?

541
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,772
And she said yes.
Guys, it was amazing!

542
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,006
You should have been there.
Barney!

543
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,441
You were not there.
Let her tell her story.

544
00:20:28,443 --> 00:20:29,576
Guys!
You were not there.

545
00:20:29,578 --> 00:20:32,445
What did you say, baby?

546
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:34,113
I said yes.

547
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,514
Ha! Told you!

548
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:38,585
How would I know that
