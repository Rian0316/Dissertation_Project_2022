4
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,871
仁爱社会

5
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,840
今天忙什么呢 先生?      内阁开会
What is it today, sir?           The Ministry.

6
00:00:51,005 --> 00:00:54,441
一上午讨论公共医疗卫生的事
All morning on Health service administration.

7
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:56,960
啊 收音机里刚刚还在播
A chap just now on the radio

8
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:01,243
说公共医疗 教育和卫生的问题
said the trouble with health,education and transport

9
00:01:01,405 --> 00:01:04,600
在于政府官员都去私立医院
is that people in Governmentgo to private hospitals

10
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,723
把孩子送去私立学校      好好
and send their kidsto private schools.        Very good.

11
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,605
喜剧节目吧?
Comedy programme, was it?

12
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:13,757
上班都坐公家车
And go to workin chauffeur-driven cars.

13
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:18,118
多少有点道理吧 先生?
Think there's something in it, sir?

14
00:01:18,285 --> 00:01:21,516
如果您和汉弗莱爵士搭公交上班
If you and Sir Humphreywent to work on a number 27...

15
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,004
不切实际
Quite impracticable!

16
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,651
我们工作时间够长了
We work long enough hours as it is,

17
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,681
哪有空等公交
without having to wait at bus stops.

18
00:01:27,845 --> 00:01:31,520
你们需要更有效率的公交      可不是
You'd need more efficient buses.Certainly would.

19
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:34,722
对 广播也是这么说的
Yes, that's what he was saying.

20
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:39,724
医疗系统也一样 您加入联合福利协会了吧 先生?
Same with the Health Service.You a member of BUPA, sir?

21
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:43,321
现在在播什么 罗伊?      "昨日议会" 先生
Anything on the radio, Roy?"Yesterday in Parliament".

22
00:01:43,485 --> 00:01:45,043
还是算了...
Don't bother...

23
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,595
兰弗先生 伯明翰的反对党成员
Mr Lanford,opposition member for Birmingham,

24
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:51,882
询问行政事务大臣吉姆・哈克
asked the AdministrativeAffairs Minister, James Hacker,

25
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,560
公共医疗行政减员一事
about reducing administratorsin the Health Service.

26
00:01:56,205 --> 00:02:00,721
是的 我们已经削减了11.3%
We have already achieveda reduction of 11.3 %

27
00:02:00,885 --> 00:02:03,115
书记和管理人员
in administrative staff

28
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:06,561
经济效益正在稳步提高
and are actively pursuingfurther economies.

29
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:10,604
大臣能否解释一下您对下院的保证
Would you explainhow his assurance to the House

30
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:15,680
为何与您部里的会议记录不同?
squares with this minutefrom his own department?

31
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,474
于是 兰弗先生戏剧化地拿出一张纸
Then Mr Lanford dramaticallyproduced a paper.

32
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:23,194
原文:"如果将行政人员重新分类"
I quote,"If admin staff were reclassified

33
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:25,674
"改为技术头衔"
from administrativeto technical...

34
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:31,995
"单位由财政年转为公历年"
and the comparison changedfrom the financial to calendar year,

35
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:37,444
"统计数字就会减少11.3%"
then the figures will showa fall of 11.3 %".

36
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:41,200
大臣能否解释一下这阴谋诡计?
Would the Minister care to commenton this shabby deception?

37
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:45,044
上套了 先生
Bit of a googly, sir.

38
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:49,361
我...我...
I... I...

39
00:02:49,525 --> 00:02:53,837
我对你手里那张纸一无所知
I have no knowledge of the documentyou're brandishing.

40
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,561
我愿意向大臣提供文件
I shall givethe file reference to the Minister

41
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:04,083
来交换一次完全独立的调查
in exchange for an assuranceof a full independent enquiry.

42
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,721
我保证发起调查
I will give that assurance.

43
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:12,844
下院宣读了苏格兰渔业法案
The Houseread the Scottish Fisheries'Bill...

44
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:16,441
不好办啊 "独立调查"
That's a bit rough, innit?"A full independent enquiry"!

45
00:03:17,725 --> 00:03:21,843
您被套进去了      我觉得我逃脱了
You were dropped in it there.I think I got away with it.

46
00:03:22,005 --> 00:03:26,237
幸好他们没问圣爱医院的事 先生      为什么?
Lucky they didn't ask youabout that new hospital, sir.Why?

47
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:31,320
完工了15个月 还没有病人
They finished it 15 months ago,and it's still got no patients.

48
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,397
一定是卫生部没钱请员工
The DHSS can't afford to staff it.

49
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:38,194
有员工 500名行政人员
It's got staff, 500 administrators.

50
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:40,560
只缺病人      谁告诉你的?
Just no patients.Who told you?

51
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:44,115
我朋友查理 卫生部长的司机
My mate Charlie,a driver for the Health Secretary.

52
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,876
汉弗莱 我太震惊了      我也是 大臣
I'm appalled!           So am I.

53
00:03:50,045 --> 00:03:51,922
玩忽职守 太不像话
The incompetence of it!

54
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:54,599
就是 真不知您中了什么邪
I can't think what came over you.

55
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,278
你说什么
I beg your pardon!

56
00:03:56,445 --> 00:04:01,121
完全独立的调查?      汉弗莱 我不是说这个
A full independent enquiry.Humphrey, that's not what I meant.

57
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:04,402
您说玩忽职守      我是说你 汉弗莱
But you mentioned incompetence.Yours, Humphrey, yours!

58
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:07,803
我 大臣?     你害我套进去的
Mine?           You dropped me into it?

59
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,765
我们不能总面面俱到
We can't foresee a small omissionfrom the brief, 

60
00:04:10,965 --> 00:04:12,800
可是独立调查?
but a full enquiry?

61
00:04:12,965 --> 00:04:16,924
我也不想被调查 但如果你落水了 有绳子就抓
I don'twant an enquiry, but ifyou're drowning and thrown a rope...

62
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:19,838
这不是绳子 这是绞索
That wasn't a rope, it was a noose!

63
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,200
职责要求您站在部里的立场上
You should've stood upfor the department!

64
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:25,357
不 汉弗莱 我为昨天的质询做了万全准备
I prepared thoroughlyfor yesterday's Question Time,

65
00:04:25,525 --> 00:04:29,404
偏不知道你在玩弄数据
but nowhere was the suggestionyou'd juggled the figures

66
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:31,476
让我误导下院
so I'd mislead the House.

67
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:36,560
大臣 您吩咐减少行政人员数目 我们就减少数目
You wanted the figures reduced?So we reduced the figures!

68
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:41,196
对 但没减少行政人员      当然没有
Yes, but not the administrators.Of course not.

69
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:46,234
这不是我的本意      大臣 我们可没有心灵感应
That's not what I meant.Minister, one isn't a mind-reader!

70
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:49,761
您说减数目 我们就减数目      还有一件事
You said reduce them, so we did.And another thing:

71
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:52,393
他们怎么知道的?又一次泄漏?
How did this get out?Another leak?

72
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:56,562
这哪是行政部 简直是漏锅
This isn't a department,it's a colander!

73
00:04:56,725 --> 00:04:58,682
什么都告诉后座议员
How can we govern responsibly,

74
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:01,082
怎能权责分明?
if back benchers get all the facts?

75
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:06,080
调查给了我们缓冲时间      那就是定时炸弹
The enquiry gives us some time.So does a time-bomb.

76
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:08,884
有没有抢险队?      抢险队?
Is there a disposal squad?Disposal squad?

77
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:12,879
能否让独立调查为我们开脱?
Couldn't we get the independentenquiry to exonerate us?

78
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:18,238
您想操纵调查?      没有没有
Do you mean rig it?No, no, no, no!

79
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:19,997
这个...对
Well... yes.

80
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,004
大臣
Minister!

81
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:25,319
这取决于主席是谁
It depends on who the chairman is.

82
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:28,795
他一定得可靠      怎么个可靠法?
He absolutely has to be sound.Sound?

83
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:34,358
得有觉悟 一点就通
He will knowwhat is required.He will perceive the implications.

84
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:38,234
有洞察力 对我们抱同情
He will have a sympathetic insightinto the problems.

85
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:41,283
总而言之 他得可靠
In short, he will be "sound".

86
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,197
你是说...收买他?
You mean... bent?

87
00:05:43,365 --> 00:05:45,356
不 当然不是
No, of course not!

88
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,676
他得自己心胸宽大
He will be a manof broad understanding.

89
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:51,518
那就...找退休政客?
How about... a retired politician?

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,358
正直得无懈可击
And unimpeachable integrity.

91
00:05:54,525 --> 00:05:56,720
对 我懂你的意思
Yes, I see what you mean.

92
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:59,001
商人?      哦 开玩笑
A businessman?Oh, really!

93
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:02,123
学者?      不 不 不
An academic?No, no, no.

94
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:07,359
你想找谁?      我想 退休公务员也许可以
Who've you got in mind?Perhaps a retired civil servant.

95
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:11,404
好主意 汉弗莱      莫里斯・威廉爵士
Good thinking, Humphrey.Sir Maurice Williams.

96
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,715
他不会太独立吧?
Might not he be too independent?

97
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:17,798
他想要个贵族头衔      就靠这个?
Well, he's hoping for a peerage.Not through this?

98
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:21,799
不 可是出对了结论能攒工分
No, but the right findingwill earn him Brownie points!

99
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,719
工分?      攒够了换徽章嘛
Brownie points?They all add up towards the badge!

100
00:06:27,205 --> 00:06:30,322
好吧 就找莫里斯爵士      谢谢您 大臣
Well, Sir Maurice it is.Thank you, Minister.

101
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:32,919
谢谢 大队长
Thank you... Brown Owl.

102
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,915
早安 伯纳
Good morning, Bernard.

103
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:43,155
两件事 首先是古巴难民      又来了
Two points, the Cuban refugees.Not that again?

104
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:46,681
关于我们拒绝出台更多优惠政策
It's about our refusalto do any more for them.

105
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:50,633
不怪我 怪财政部 谁能对抗财政部      没错
It's not my fault, it's the Treasury.You can't beat the Treasury!

106
00:06:50,805 --> 00:06:52,602
我不表态
I shall say nothing.

107
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,020
再公开丢一次脸
One more public humiliation 

108
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,283
我自己都成政治难民了
and I'llbecome a political refugee myself.

109
00:06:58,445 --> 00:07:02,836
还有一件呢?      您问伦敦北郊那间空壳医院
And the other point?The alleged empty hospital.

110
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,964
对对      我提醒过您 司机消息网并不完全可靠
As I warned you, the driver's networkis not wholly reliable.

111
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,037
罗伊说错了      谢天谢地
Roy's wrong.Thank heavens forthat!

112
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:13,993
怎么查到的?      私人秘书消息网
How did you find out?The private secretaries' network.

113
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:15,484
详情呢?
And?

114
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:20,355
实际上医院里行政人员只有342名
In fact, there are only 342administrative staff at the hospital.

115
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:24,916
其他170人是门房 清洁工 洗衣工和厨子之类
The other 170 are porters, cleaners,laundry workers, cooks, etc.

116
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:26,643
医护人员呢?
And medical staff?

117
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:28,875
那倒没有
Oh, none of them.

118
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,079
没有?      没有
None?             No!

119
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,043
伯纳 我们说的是圣爱医院吧?
We are talkingabout St Edward's Hospital?

120
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,958
是 刚落成15个月 人员齐备
Yes. It's brand-new and fully-staffed.

121
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,844
不幸赶上政府削减预算
Unfortunately, there were cutbacks,

122
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,963
所以没钱开展医疗了
so there was no moneyfor medical services.

123
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:47,834
一家新医院 500名行政人员 没医生 没病人?
A hospital with over 500 non-medicalstaff and no patients?

124
00:07:48,005 --> 00:07:50,041
有一名病人      一名?
There's one patient.One?

125
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:54,403
副主管绊在脚手架上 摔断了腿
The deputy administrator fell overscaffolding and broke his leg.

126
00:07:54,565 --> 00:07:56,123
老天爷
Good God!

127
00:07:56,285 --> 00:08:00,403
幸好下院没问 为什么消息没泄漏?
Thank heavens I wasn't askedabout this! Why hasn't it got out?

128
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,762
实际上 它被打扮成工地
It's been contrivedto look like a building site,

129
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:07,076
至今没人发现它开业了
and so far no one's realisedit's operational!

130
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,521
像脚手架 水泥车 正常工程用品
You know, scaffolding, skips,the normal thing?

131
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:14,674
正常?我得赶在反对党前面去看看
Normal? I'd better look at itbefore the opposition does.

132
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:18,121
对 很奇怪媒体还没发现
Yes, it's surprisingthe press haven't found out.

133
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:21,118
伯纳 幸好大多数记者素质底下
Fortunately, most journalistsare so incompetent,

134
00:08:21,285 --> 00:08:23,879
大概连今天星期三都不知道
they wouldn't knowtoday is Wednesday.

135
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,003
今天是星期四 大臣
It's actually Thursday, Minister.

136
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,680
就坐那边
Let's sit down there.

137
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:36,678
你们大臣干吗对圣爱医院感兴趣?
Why is your Minister interestedin this hospital?

138
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:40,474
他很担心那里没病人
He's greatly concernedthat it has no patients.

139
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,398
林子大了      就是
It takes all sorts.           Yes.

140
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,681
晚上好      晚上好
Evening.Good evening.

141
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:51,634
没有医护人员哪来的病人?      就是
How can there be patientswhen it has no nursing staff?

142
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:56,274
谢谢      太好了
Thank you.Splendid.

143
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:58,720
汉弗莱爵士      谢谢
Sir Humphrey?Thank you.

144
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:05,203
卫生部认为开业需要时间
We've found at the DHSSthat it takes time to get things going.

145
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:08,881
首先得安排好
First of all, you have to sort out

146
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,081
日常运转
the smooth running of the hospital.

147
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,333
收治病人可不能改善现状
Having patients aroundwould be no help at all.

148
00:09:15,605 --> 00:09:18,039
他们只会碍事
They'd just be in the way.

149
00:09:18,205 --> 00:09:23,643
告诉他现在是磨合期      对 磨合期
Tell him this is the run-in period.Yes, yes, the run-in period.

150
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,562
要磨合多久?你看
How long is the run-in periodgoing to last?

151
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,603
我们大臣承诺发起独立调查
My Minister's agreedto an independent enquiry.

152
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:34,963
你知道我最恨这个      我知道 可是...
You knowwhat I think about that.Yes, I know, but...

153
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:40,719
我们会给圣爱医院找些病人
We are going to getsome patients in to St Edward's...

154
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,197
终究会吧?
eventually?

155
00:09:44,045 --> 00:09:45,797
不是吗?
Aren't we?

156
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:47,956
有可能
It's possible.

157
00:09:49,725 --> 00:09:52,523
确实有这个意向
Certainly our present intention.

158
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:55,596
一两年之内
In a year or two.

159
00:09:56,525 --> 00:10:00,677
大概...等财政状况改善点
Probably... when the financialsituation has eased up a bit.

160
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,278
此前不会吗?      不
Not till then?            No

161
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:06,723
到处都在关闭 怎能破例开40个新病房?
How can I open 40 new wardswhen I'm closing everywhere else?

162
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:11,879
财政部和内阁都会反对      我们大臣可能要关闭它
Treasury wouldn't wear it.My Minister may want to shut the place.

163
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,240
不可能 工会怎么办?
Impossible! What about the unions?

164
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:19,203
已经有工会了?      这倒是
Are the unions active there yet?Good point.

165
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:25,757
记得在萨瑟医院煽风点火那人吗?
Remember that fire brand agitatorat Southwark Hospital?

166
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:30,323
比利・弗雷泽 讨厌鬼 可能有用
Billy Fraser, odious man.Could be useful.

167
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:33,124
该放他出马了
Time he was moved on.

168
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:41,156
卫生部门正在官僚之路上高歌猛进
The Health Service is an advancedcase of galloping bureaucracy!

169
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,237
怎能说高歌猛进
Oh, certainly not galloping!

170
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,715
最多算稳步前进
A gentle canterat the most.

171
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:53,003
每天有报告涌进来 对吧伯纳      哪来的 大臣?
Instances flood into this office.From whom, Minister?

172
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:56,441
议员 选民 医生 护士 公众
MPs, constituents,doctors, nurses, the public.

173
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,436
刁民
Trouble makers!

174
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:01,403
公众?      他们最不安分
The public?They're the worst.

175
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,398
听听这个
Listen to this.

176
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:06,637
"申请听诊器:基于目前状况"
"Stethoscope requisition:Due to current situation,

177
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,878
"无法按需核发听诊器"

178
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,481
"但可以为现有听诊器"
We can, however,supply longertubes

179
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:17,239
"配备更长的胶管"
for your existing stethoscopes".

180
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:21,714
怎么了?      你不觉得奇怪吗?
Well?Doesn't that strike you as odd?

181
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:24,843
不 如果增加胶管...      不 不
Lf they have long tubes...No, no.

182
00:11:25,005 --> 00:11:28,475
他们不要长胶管 要听诊器
No, not longer stethoscopes,MORE stethoscopes.

183
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,318
如果胶管够长
If they had really long tubes,

184
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:36,400
医生可以坐在原地 听遍所有病人
the doctor could stand in one placeand listen to all the chests.

185
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,281
这个呢? "护士制服"
What about nurses' uniforms?

186
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:45,801
"显然目前标准制服"
"Apparently the latestconsignment of nurses' coats

187
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:50,117
"均以半透明材料制作"

188

"护士请求上报制服监督委员会"

189
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:57,556
"评估问题严重程度"
who will assessthe extent of the problem".

190
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:04,116
这倒是个美差      汉弗莱 我说真的!
Nice work if you can get it.Humphrey, I'm serious!

191
00:12:04,885 --> 00:12:10,403
"请注意 柔软型卫生纸专供病人而非职工"
"Please note that the soft toiletrolls are for patients not staff.

192
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:15,355
"似乎近来职工在用柔软型卫生纸"
It would appear that staff havebeen using the soft toilet rolls

193
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,198
"作此种或彼种用途"
for one reason or another".

194
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:23,997
"圣史蒂芬太平间圣诞期间将关闭"
"St Stephen's Mortuarywill be closed over Christmas.

195
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:27,362
"节日期间 请医护人员"
During the holiday,medical staff are to cooperate

196
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:30,517
"减轻太平间负担"
in keeping pressureoff this department".

197
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:34,843
非常合理 情有可原
A very civil and reasonable request.

198
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:40,159
平常医生该让太平间繁荣昌盛吗?
You think the rest of the yeardoctors work hard to keep it busy?

199
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:43,523
大臣 这些都是特例
These are a few isolated examples.

200
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:48,964
大体上 医疗部门已达到政府最高效率
The Health Service is as efficientas the Government allows it.

201
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,037
胡说 汉弗莱 看数字就知道
Nonsense!The figures speak for themselves.

202
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:57,233
10年来 医疗部门行政人员增加了4万名
In ten years, the number ofadministrators has risen by 40,000.

203
00:12:57,405 --> 00:13:00,841
病床减少了6万张
The number of hospital bedshas fallen by 60,000.

204
00:13:01,005 --> 00:13:07,001
医疗年度支出增加了1500万 净增长
The annual cost of the HealthService has gone up by ?.5 billion!

205
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:11,158
工业增长也有这个速度就好了
If only British industrycould match this growth record.

206
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,204
你觉得多拨款少治病人
You think spendingmore money on fewer patients

207
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:17,799
余钱拿来雇行政人员
so we can employmore administrators

208
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:22,038
是对国会和纳税人负责吗?
is a good way of spendingthe taxpayer's money?

209
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,274
当然
Certainly.

210
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:27,120
汉弗莱 拨款是为了把病人治好 要专款专用
This money is solelyto make sick people better.

211
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,163
不不 大臣
No, no, no, Minister.

212
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:32,885
是为了我们大家好
It is to make everybody better.

213
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:37,402
更好体现大家的关注与仁爱之心
Better for showing the extentof their care and compassion.

214
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:42,844
您看 当款项集中投入医疗或社会服务
You see, when money is allocatedto the Health orSocial Services,

215
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:46,395
议会和国民都觉得...升华了
Parliament and the countryfeel...cleansed.

216
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:51,239
净化了 赎罪了 这是种牺牲
Purified. Absolved. It is a sacrifice.

217
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:53,043
花言巧语
Dreadful claptrap!

218
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,000
牺牲仪式之后
After the sacrifice is made,

219
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,283
没人会问祭品去了哪里
nobody questionswhat happened to the offering.

220
00:13:59,445 --> 00:14:02,198
汉弗莱 你错了 公众确实反对滥用
The public does careif it's misspent.

221
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:05,880
恕我直言 他们反对公开滥用
They care it's not seento be misspent.

222
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:10,755
才不是呢 看看那桩精神病院丑闻
That's not true. Look at the uproarover mental hospital scandals.

223
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,802
正是如此 大臣
My point exactly.

224
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,480
顺顺当当浪费了多少年 几十年
Those abuses had been going onhappily for years.

225
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,638
没人关心钱花到哪去了
Nobody was concernedwhat was being done with their money.

226
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,273
他们只恨知道了真相
What outraged themwas being told.

227
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,197
汉弗莱 多世故的烟幕弹
A cynical smokescreen!

228
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,008
你我都同意
Are we or are we not agreed

229
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:30,678
医院不能专养行政人员吧?
there's no pointin a hospital run solelyforthe staff?

230
00:14:30,845 --> 00:14:35,839
我不会这么说      我会
That's not how I would express it.It's how I would.

231
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,199
确实
Indeed.

232
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:42,475
那你怎么说?      当然 总的来说
How would you express it?At the end of the day,

233
00:14:42,645 --> 00:14:45,762
治病救人是医院的职能之一
one of a hospital's prime functionsis patient care.

234
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,244
之一?还有什么?
One?

235
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:51,318
没有钱请医护人员
Until we have the moneyfor nursing and medical staff,

236
00:14:51,485 --> 00:14:55,524
这一职能18个月内不能履行
it's a function we can't pursue.In 18 months orso...

237
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:58,882
18个月?      届时可以开些病房
18 months?We can open some wards.

238
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,400
不行 汉弗莱 必须现在病房全开
No, it's got to be now.

239
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:06,035
好吧 那就组成部门联席委员会
I suppose we could forman inter-departmental committee

240
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:09,322
考察提早收治病人
to examine the feasibilityof monitoring a proposal

241
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,158
这一提案的可行性
for admitting patients earlier.

242
00:15:12,605 --> 00:15:15,642
出结果要多久?      不久
How long would that take to report?Not long.

243
00:15:15,805 --> 00:15:19,241
多久?      大概18个月
How long?About 18 months.

244
00:15:19,965 --> 00:15:23,560
我提议裁掉所有人员
I suggestwe get ridof all the staff there

245
00:15:23,725 --> 00:15:28,241
省下钱开放其他医院闲置病房      大臣
and use the money to openclosed wards in other hospitals.

246
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:33,798
等有钱了 再给圣爱医院配备医生开业 您可同意?
When we can afford it, we openSt Edward's with medical staff.

247
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:37,753
大臣 如此您把开业时间推后了好几年
Do that and you'll delaythe opening for patients for years.

248
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:41,281
为什么      您觉得没病人 行政人员就闲着?
Why?You talk as if the staffhave nothing to do!

249
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:43,800
有什么事      拜托 大臣
What do they do?Really, Minister!

00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:37,317
悬壶济世 治病救人
Ill people! Healing the sick!

283
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:43,162
可是大臣 这些基本工作和病人不相干
But all these vital tasks mustbe done with or without patients.

284
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,756
为什么?

285
00:17:46,685 --> 00:17:49,563

还得怎么说?为什么?

288
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,678
不打仗您就遣散军队吗?
Would you sack the armybecause there's no war?

289
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:02,679
两码事 医院必须出效益
Completely different!A hospital must produce results.

290
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:08,477
大臣 效益不看结果 得看行动 现在医院很景气
We don't measure our successby results but by activity.

291
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:13,002
这500人已经操劳过度了
Those 500 peopleare seriously overworked.

292
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:19,041
预计编制有650人

293

您要看医院的报告吗?

没有行政人员 医院永不能开业
We need administratorsor the hospital will never open.

297
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:35,875
裁掉后勤工人      也不行 工会不同意
Sack the ancillary staff.The unions won'twear it.

298
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:40,914
各裁一半 省下钱来请医生护士
Sack half and use the moneyto get doctors and nurses,

299
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,440
开几个病房

我们不占理 就照你的来
Not much of a case.Can't fight you on it.

313
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,955
什么意思?
What do you mean?

314
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:49,358
我们承认不能在空壳医院里养后勤人员
We realise you can't keep ancillarystaff on in an empty hospital.

315
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:52,723
会不会太悲观了?
Isn't that a bit defeatist?

316
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:55,681
什么?
What?

317
00:19:55,845 --> 00:19:59,440
你们不会不管他们吧?      你是说...
Surely, you can stick up forthem?You want us to...?

318
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:02,722
可不是你们一方的事
It's not just your workers, you know?

319
00:20:02,885 --> 00:20:08,323
那342名公务员得有人可管理
The 342 civil servants must havesome workers to administer.

320
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:13,320
怎会裁到公务员头上?      时世艰难啊
Civil servants are never laid off.We live in disturbing times.

321
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:18,960
你是说 我们全行业反抗 你会支持?
You mean, if we take industrialaction, you'll support us?

322
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:22,435
亲爱的布赖恩 我是常任秘书

324
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:29,115
我怎么能支持罢工呢
I couldn't possibly countenanceany such action.

325
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:33,601
不过...如果各位工友
But... if there wereeffective opposition

326
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,120
强烈施压
from the ancillary workers,

327
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:39,004
公务员也会支持
the civil servantswould have to stay.

会员都认命了
They're resigned to it by now.

比利・弗雷泽也认命啦?

那就不一样了 工人们就缺人撑腰壮胆
Well, that's a different matter,with some real shop-floor militancy.

管理500人是个大工程 大臣
Running an organisationof 500 people is a big job.

But if they weren't here,they wouldn't be here!

359
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:29,875
这不对头 不能这样下去
This is wrong. It won't do.

360
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:33,117
再不收病人 我就关闭医院
Either get some patientsor I'll close it.

361
00:23:33,285 --> 00:23:38,234
总有一天 大臣...      别"总有一天" 马上!
Well, in the course of time...Not in the course of time. Now!

You mean 300 jobs lost?          Yes, I do.

医院不是就业处 它是治病用的
A hospital is a placefor healing of the sick!

它是我们会员的衣食父母 你要裁掉他们
It's employment for my members,and you want to sack them.

374
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:32,559
这算哪门子"仁爱社会"?
Is that your compassionate society?

375
00:24:32,725 --> 00:24:35,717
对病人仁爱 不是对你们会员
Compassionate to patientsrather than your members!

How can you do this to patients?It's Mr Hackerthat's doing it.
