- 午安  - 好吧
- Afternoon.  - Yeah.

56
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:11,390
他总是这副样子
He's always like that.

57
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,720
今天过得不太顺吗?
Bad day was it?

58
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,200
昨天你才搬进来跟他一起住 今天就和他一起破案了
Since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together.

59
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,840
你看你这副高兴的样子 一点都不体面
Mwah! Look at you, all happy, it's not decent.

60
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,810
管它体面不体面呢 哈德森太太 游戏开局了!
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!

61
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,910
不要搞英雄崇拜 约翰
Don't make people into heroes, John.

62
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,180
英雄并不存在 就算存在 我也不在其列
Heroes don't exist and, if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.

63
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,630
我要让你下地狱
I will burn the heart out of you.

64
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,030
好了 这样应该就可以了
Right, this should do it.

65
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,380
- 你有穿裤子吗?  - 没
- Are you wearing any pants?  - No.

66
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:39,940
好吧
OK.

67
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,240
我就想你这样记住我 记住我是揍过/打败了你的女人
This is how I want you to remember me, the woman who beat you.

68
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,280
但其实根本就没有什么怪物
But there never was any monster.

69
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,510
夏洛克? 我们终于走到这步了
Sherlock? Here we are, at last.

70
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,450
- 再见 约翰  - 夏洛克!
- Goodbye, John.  - Sherlock!

71
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,040
那东西会要了你的命
Those things will kill you.

72
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,710
你这个混蛋!
Oh, you bastard!

73
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,050
追寻罪犯的快感令人血脉贲张
The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins,

74
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,350
你我二人对阵整个世界
just the two of us against the rest of the world.

75
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,140
等一下!
Wait!

76
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,620
我们得协调一致才行
We're going to need to coordinate.

77
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,340
我只向你再要一个奇迹
I asked you for one more miracle.

78
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,800
- 我要你不要死掉  - 我听到你的话了
- I asked you to stop being dead.  - I heard you.

79
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,480
闭嘴! 你才不是什么破案专家呢 从来都不是
Shut up! You are not a puzzle solver, you never have been.

80
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,590
你只是爱作秀!
You're a drama queen!

81
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,130
现在里面有个人就要死了
Now there is a man in there about to die.

82
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,000
游戏开局了 那就解决它!
The game is on, solve it!

83
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,720
他就是勒索界的拿破仑
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

84
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,630
你这次当不了英雄了 福尔摩斯先生
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr. Holmes.

85
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,840
我是个高智商的反社会分子!
I'm a high-functioning sociopath!

86
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,240
无论把夏洛克
There is no prison in which

87
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,240
关进哪一所监狱
we could incarcerate Sherlock without

88
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,010
都会引起日常暴动
causing a riot on a daily basis.

89
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,240
但另一种选择 则需要征得您的首肯
The alternative, however, would require your approval.

90
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,240
致那些最好的时光 约翰
To the very best of times, John.

91
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,800
你想我了吗?
Did you miss me?

92
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,280
你想我了吗?
Did you miss me?

93
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:42,360
这怎么可能?
How is this possible?

94
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,840
- 流放生活过得如何?  - 我才走了四分钟
- How is the exile going?  - I've only been gone four minutes.

95
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,910
希望你已经吸取了教训
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.

96
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,330
这次又是谁需要我了?
Who needs me this time?

97
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,150
想我了吗?
Miss me?

98
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,700
英格兰
England.

99
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,870
"第二次阿富汗战争予以多人荣誉和晋升
"The Second Afghan War brought honours and promotion to many.

100
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,710
但它带给我的只是不幸与灾难"
But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster."

101
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,440
会没事的 上尉
All right, Captain.

102
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,250
"我拖着无法康复的身体回到了英格兰
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined

103
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,370
未来一片黯淡
and my future bleak.

104
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,450
在这种情况下 我自然而然地选择了伦敦
Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London.

105
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,130
这个帝国所有的闲散之人都被丢弃在了..."
That great cesspool into which all the loungers..."

106
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:51,270
- 华生!  - "这藏污纳垢之所 "
- Watson!  - "And idlers of the empire are drained."

107
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,970
华生!
Watson!

108
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,380
我是斯坦福啊
Stamford.

109
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,890
还记得我吗?
Remember?

110
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,210
之前巴茨医学院的同学
We were at Barts together.

111
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,370
当然记得 斯坦福
Yes, of course. Stamford.

112
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,460
天啊! 你这些年去了哪里?
Good Lord! Where have you been?

113
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
你都瘦得皮包骨了!
You're as thin as a rake!

114
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,370
好歹我还活着回来了 很多人可没我这么幸运
I made it home. Many weren't so lucky.

115
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,380
- 现在情况怎么样?  - 我需要一个住的地方
- So what now?  - I need a place to live.

116
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,860
要找一个看得上眼 价格还能承受的地方可不容易
Somewhere decent at an affordable price. It's not easy.

117
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,490
你知道吗 你是今天第二个对我说这话的人了
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.

118
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,390
第一个是谁?
Hmm? Who was the first?

119
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,450
天啊
Good Lord.

120
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,250
显然他是在做实验啊
It's an experiment, apparently.

121
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,410
通过抽打尸体 
Beating corpses to establish how long

122
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,410
观察死后淤青的存留时间
after death bruising is still possible.

123
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,250
- 这样做有什么医学上的目的吗?  - 不确定
- Is there a medical point to that?  - Not sure.

124
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,250
我也不知道 你说的那位朋友现在在哪里?
Neither am I. So, where's this friend of yours, then?

125
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,730
不好意思
Excuse me.

126
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,690
但愿我们没有打扰到你
I do hope we're not interrupting.

127
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,320
据我观察 你去过阿富汗
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.

128
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,650
这位是华生医生 这位是夏洛克先生...
Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock...

129
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,840
反应能力出色 你可以的
Excellent reflexes, you'll do.

130
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,410
不好意思 你说什么...?
I'm sorry...?

131
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,820
我看中了摄政公园附近的一套房子
I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.

132
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,900
我们可以一起租下来
Between us we could afford them.

133
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,730
房子? 谁说房子的事了?
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms?

134
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,690
我说了 我和他今天早上提过这件事 
I did, I mentioned it this morning,

135
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,690
说我需要找人合租
I was in need of a fellow lodger.

136
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,650
然后他中午就携一个人出现了
Now he appears after lunch in the company

137
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,650
这个人有军队素养
of a man of military aspect

138
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,730
皮肤黝黑 最近负伤
with a tan and a recent injury, both suggestive

139
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,650
由此可以推断他参加了阿富汗战役 然后被强制退役
of the campaign in Afghanistan and an enforced departure from it.

140
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,410
结论就相当明显了 
The conclusion seemed inescapable.

141
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,410
我们明天晚上继续探讨细节
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.

142
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,770
恕我先失陪了
Now, if you'll excuse me,

143
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,690
旺兹沃思有场绞刑 我要赶去参加
I have a hanging in Wandsworth and I'd hate them to start without me.

144
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,410
- 绞刑?  - 我有专业兴趣
- A hanging?  - I take a professional interest.

145
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,840
我还拉小提琴 抽烟斗 我想这些应该都不是问题
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe. I presume that's not a problem.

146
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,500
不是...
Er, no, well...

147
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,130
很明显你不介意被人插话
And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting

148
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,810
我们一定能好好相处的
to the end of a sentence. We'll get along splendidly.

149
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,050
那就定明晚七点
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.

150
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,290
我叫夏洛克・福尔摩斯 
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes

151
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,890
地址是贝克街221B
and the address is 221B, Baker Street.

152
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,010
没错... 他总是这副样子
Yes... he's always been like that.

153
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,350
报纸! 报纸!
Papers! Papers!

154
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,330

00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,690
- "蓝宝石案"卖得怎么样?  - 非常畅销 华生医生
- Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing?  - Very popular, Dr. Watson.

156
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,050
下个月还会有谋杀案报道吗?
Is there going to be a proper murder next month?

157
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,130
我去找那些罪犯聊聊吧
I'll have a word with the criminal classes.

158
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,670
那就太好了
If you wouldn't mind.

159
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,900
那是他吗? 他在车上吗?
Is that him? Is he in there?

160
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,370
嗷! 不在
Ow! No.

161
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,110
不 不 他不在 回见
No, no, not at all. Er, good day to you.

162
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,740
走吧
Let on, walk.

163
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,860
圣诞快乐 福尔摩斯先生!
Merry Christmas, Mr. Holmes!

164
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,410
福尔摩斯先生!
Mr. Holmes!

165
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,290
你回家之前能不能先通知我一下!
I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home!

166
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,080
我自己都不知道 哈德森太太
I hardly knew myself, Mrs. Hudson.

167
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,610
被肢解的乡绅就是这点不好
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.

168
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,190
想和他们约时间见面太难了
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.

169
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,910
- 这里面是什么东西?  - 别管了
- What's in there?  - Never mind.

170
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,230
谢谢
Thank you.

171
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,990
你抓到凶手了吗 福尔摩斯先生?
Did you catch the murderer, Mr. Holmes?

172
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,230
抓到凶手了 但是还没找到受害者的双腿 算是平局吧
Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs. I think we'll call it a draw.

173
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,340
华生医生 我看到你又出版了一篇故事
And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr. Watson.

174
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,770
- 是的 你觉得好看吗?  - 不好看
- Yes, did you enjoy it?  - No.

175
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,230
是吗?
Oh?

176
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,250
- 你写的都不好看  - 为什么?
- I never enjoy them.  - Why not?

177
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,510
我好像什么话都没有 是吧?
Well, I never say anything, do I?

178
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,670
照你写的 我只会领人上楼 给你们做早饭
According to you, I just show people up the stairs and serve you breakfasts.

179
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,250
从叙事的角度看 笼统地讲 这些就是你的功能
Well, within the narrative, that is, broadly speaking, your function.

180
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:19,750
我的什么?!
My what?!

181
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,520
别以为就你一个不高兴 哈德森太太 那个讲狗的故事里我也没什么笔墨
Don't feel singled out, Mrs. Hudson, I'm hardly in the dog one.

182
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,440
"讲狗的"?
"The dog one"?

183
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,870
我是你们的房东 不是为情节服务的小配角
I'm your landlady, not a plot device.

184
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,850
你是说贝克斯菲尔德的猎狗?
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles?

185
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,510
而且这房子还被你搞得阴森森的
And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.

186
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,510
你去找那个插画师啊 他简直是在胡闹!
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control!

187
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,250
我现在不留胡子别人还认不出我来了
I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.

188
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,030
"这么多年来 我很高兴能够记录我了不起的朋友
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record

189
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,630
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生的成就
the exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

190
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,350
有时候 我很难在他办过的那么多案子里
it has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many

191
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,190
选出一件来呈现给读者
cases to set before my readers.

192
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,630
有一些故事还太敏感
Some are still too sensitive to recount,

193
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,760
还有些故事发生的时间离现在太近
whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.

194
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,390
但在这些冒险故事里 只有一个案子让我的朋友
But in all our many adventures together, no case pushed my friend

195
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:03,630
在精神和身体上都走向了极端
to such mental and physical extremes

196
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,840
那就是可恶的新娘一案!"
as that of The Abominable Bride!"

197
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,550
天啊!
Good Lord!

198
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,730
哈德森太太 我的客厅里站着一个女人!
Mrs. Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!

199
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,570
你是故意的吗?
Is it intentional?

200
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,870
她是你的客户 我和她说了你不在家 她非要等你
She's a client. Said you were out, insisted on waiting.

201
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,460
你要不要坐下来说话?
Would you, er, care to sit down?

202
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,550
你问过她是来干什么的吗?
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?

203
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,040
你自己问啊!
You ask her!

204
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,030
你怎么没问她?
Why didn't you ask her?

205
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,800
我怎么问啊 书里的我不是没台词吗?! 
How could I, what with me not talking and everything?!

206
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,050
天啊 随便给她几句台词吧 不然她得饿死我们!
Oh, for God's sake, give her some lines, she's perfectly capable of starving us!

207
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,800
下午好 我是夏洛克・福尔摩斯 这是我的朋友兼同事 华生医生
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes, this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

208
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,950
- 在他面前你可以畅所欲言 反正他也听不懂  - 福尔摩斯!
- You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.  - Holmes!

209
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,950
不过 你先别说话 让我来观察推理一下
However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.

210
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,510
你有一种很顽皮的幽默感
You have an impish sense of humour,

211
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,030
你用这种幽默来减轻自己的痛苦
which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.

212
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,540
你最近和一个看上去很绅士的男人结了婚
You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition,

213
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,150
但是他离开了你
who has now abandoned you

214
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,790
去干一些莫名其妙的事情
for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.

215
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,500
你最后的办法就是来到这里
You have come to this agency as a last resort,

216
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,970
想要和你的丈夫和好
in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.

217
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,550
天啊 福尔摩斯!
Good Lord, Holmes!

218
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,190
当然这一切 我都是根据你的香水推断出来的
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.

219
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,190
她的香水?
Her perfume?

220
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,830
是的 她的香水 对我来说是个提示 对你则是灾难
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.

221
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,660
为什么?
How so?

222
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,670
因为我认出来了 而你没有
Because I recognised it and you did not.

223
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,050
- 玛丽!  - 约翰
- Mary!  - John.

224
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,550
你怎么假装成顾客跑过来了?
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client?

225
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,580
因为我只有这样才能见到我的丈夫 丈夫啊
Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.

226
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,150
这可是让全世界的人都感兴趣的故事啊
It was an affair of international intrigue.

227
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:39,200
- 是一个乡绅被谋杀了而已  - 不管怎样 事情紧急
- It was a murdered country squire.  - Nevertheless, matters were pressing.

228
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,170
我不是不让你去 亲爱的 可是你一走就把我丢下了
I don't mind you going, my darling, I mind you leaving me behind.

229
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,300
可是你能做什么呢?!
But what could you do?!

230
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,870
那你又会做什么 不就是走来走去 记记笔记 做个惊讶的表情嘛?!
Well, what do you do, except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?!

231
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,910
够了!
Enough!

232
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,720
舞台已经搭好了 幕布也已经升起
The stage is set, the curtain rises.

233
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,120
我们可以开始了
We are ready to begin.

234
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,370
开始什么?
Begin what?

235
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,430
有时候想要破一个案子 得先把另外一个破了
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.

236
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,790
- 原来你手头上有案子 还是新的?  - 是老案子 很老很老的案子
- Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?  - An old one, very old.

237
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,130
我得往深处探索
I shall have to go deep.

238
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,610
深处? 什么深处?
Deep? Into what?

239
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,570
我自己
Myself.

240
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,310
雷斯垂德! 别待在门外了 进来吧
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.

241
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,950
- 你怎么知道是我?  - 听脚步声肯定没错
- How did you know it was me?  - The regulation tread is unmistakable.

242
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,020
你的比琼斯的轻 比格雷森的重
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.

243
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,690
我 我刚上楼... 哈德森太太现在好像都不说话了
I, I just came up... Mrs. Hudson didn't seem to be talking.

244
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,750
她已经开始用讽刺的方法进行文学批评了
I fear she has branched into literary criticism by means of satire.

245
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,160
现在的房东都喜欢这么干
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.

246
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,810
你不上班怎么跑到这里来了?
What brings you here in your off-duty hours?

247
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,070
- 你怎么知道我不上班?  - 自从你到这里
- How do you know I'm off duty?  - Well, since your arrival,

248
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,830
你百分之四十的时间都在看着我的酒瓶
you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.

249
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,720
华生 给探长倒杯酒吧
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.

250
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:51,160
雷斯垂德 你来干什么?
So... Lestrade, what can we do for you?

251
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,470
我不是为了公事来拜访的 我只是顺路经过
Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.

252
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,310
你只是随便来看看的?
A social call?

253
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,410
是啊 来给你们道一声节日快乐的
Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.

254
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,430
- 圣诞快乐  - 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas.  - Merry Christmas.

255
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,350
- 圣诞快乐  - 圣诞快乐
- Merry Christmas.  - Merry Christmas.

256
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,670
终于说完了
Thank God that's over.

257
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,270
探长 到底是发生了什么奇怪的事情
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you

258
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,790
让你来到我家 却觉得说出来有些尴尬呢?
to my door, but embarrasses you to relate?

259
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,910
谁说出事了?
Who said anything happened?

260
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,000
你说的 每一句简短的话语都有这个意思
You did. By every means short of actual speech.

261
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,470
等等 等等 福尔摩斯 你这次判断错了
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.

262
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,490
那么 医生 请纠正我
Then, correct me, Doctor.

263
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,640
他并不是想要喝一杯 而是需要喝一杯
He didn't want a drink, he needed one.

264
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,200
他也并非感到尴尬 而是有些害怕
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.

265
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,080
看来我的朋友也在学习嘛 进步还不小呢
My boswell is learning. They do grow up so fast.

266
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,830
华生 我们来帮他重拾苏格兰场的信心吧
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.

267
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,820
探长 请坐下说吧
Inspector, do sit down.

268
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,550
我... 我其实也不是害怕
I'm... I'm not afraid, exactly.

269
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,910
恐惧是面对危险时的智慧
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger,

270
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,630
没什么丢人的
it is nothing to be ashamed of.

271
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:51,950
谢谢
Thank you.

272
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,790
那么 请从头开始说吧
From the beginning, then.

273
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,240
你!
You!

274
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,380
别 求求你了!
No, please!

275
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,580
你呢?!
You?!

276
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,190
等一下
A moment.

277
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,710
这是什么时候的事?
When was this?

278
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,610
昨天上午
Yesterday morning.

279
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,260
人们是如何描述那位新娘的外表的?
The bride's face, how was it described?

280
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,430
"她的脸如死人般惨白 嘴唇鲜红如同流血的伤口"
"White as death, mouth like a crimson wound."

281
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,350
这是诗歌还是真相?
Poetry or truth?

282
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,790
很多人都会表示这俩是一样的
Many would say they're the same thing.

283
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,910
没错 你个笨蛋 但这是诗歌还是真相?
Yes, idiots. Poetry or truth?

284
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,190
那之后 我也亲眼看到了她的脸
I saw her face myself. Afterwards.

285
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,550
什么之后?
After what?

286
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,110
你?
You?

287
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,490
还是我?
Or me?

288
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,710
天啊 雷斯垂德 一个女人在大庭广众之下开枪自杀
Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public

289
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,320
你竟然还需要我帮你找凶手?
and you need help identifying the guilty party?

290
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,700
苏格兰场的水准真是越来越没有底线了
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.

291
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,270
我不是因为这个才来的
That's not why I'm here.

292
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,680
- 我猜也是  - 她叫什么 那个新娘?
- I surmised.  - What was her name, the bride?

293
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,430
她叫艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提 昨天是她的婚礼
Emelia Ricoletti. Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.

294
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,280
当然 有人报警了
The police, of course, were called.

295
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,830
她的尸体也被送到了停尸房
And her body taken to the morgue.

296
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,770
这是标准流程 你为什么要告诉我们显而易见的事?
Standard procedure. Why are you telling us what may be presumed?

297
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,470
因为后面的事与这有关
Because of what happened next.

298
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,590
这是几个小时之后 发生在莱姆豪斯的事
Limehouse. Just a few hours later.

299
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,260
他是艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提的丈夫 托马斯・瑞可兰提
Thomas Ricoletti. Emelia Ricoletti's husband.

300
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
或许他正要去停尸房认领遗体?
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains?

301
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,670
看起来没这个必要了
As it turned out, he was saved the trip.

302
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:13,430
# 请不要忘记我 #
# Do not forget me #

303
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,420
# 请不要忘记我 #
# Do not forget me #

304
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,430
# 记住那个女孩... #  
# Remember the maid... #

305
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,910
你是谁?
Who are you?

306
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,590
# 那个磨坊里的女孩... #
# The maid of the mill... #

307
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,660
你为什么要杀我? 你到底是谁!
Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are!

308
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,000
亲爱的 你还记得我们的歌吗?
You recognise our song, my dear?

309
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,590
在我们的婚礼上 我还唱过呢
I sang it at our wedding.

310
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,800
艾米莉亚?
Emelia?

311
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,150
你... 你不是已经死了吗 你不可能还活着 你都死了啊!
You... you're dead, you can't be here, you died!

312
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,030
我漂亮吗 托马斯?
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?

313
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,920
是不是和你娶我那天一样漂亮?
As beautiful as the day you married me?

314
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,200
这到底是怎么回事?!
What the hell is all this about?!

315
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,700
小警员 你难道看不出来吗?
What does it look like, my handsome friend?

316
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,060
这是个有枪杀案的婚礼
It's a shotgun wedding.

317
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,420
直到死亡将我们分开 这案子里还来了两遍
Till death us do part. Twice in this case.

318
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:30,880
太神奇了
Extraordinary.

319
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,000
这不可能
Impossible.

320
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,010
真是精彩
Superb.

321
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,790
当街自杀 死人行凶 雷斯垂德 我们都要被你惯坏了
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse. Lestrade, you're spoiling us.

322
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:38,930
华生 去拿你的帽子和大衣吧
Watson, your hat and coat.

323
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,300
- 我们要去哪?  - 停尸房
- Where are we going?  - To the morgue.

324
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,750
一般不用着急去停尸房 不过这次我们一分钟都不能耽误
There's not a moment to lose, which one can so rarely say of a morgue.

325
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,110
我难道只能坐在这里吗?
And am I just to sit here?

326
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,790
当然不是 亲爱的 我们回来的时候肯定很饿
Not at all, my dear. We'll be hungry later.

327
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,270
等下 福尔摩斯 我难道要穿着苏格兰花呢外套去停尸房?
Holmes, just one thing, tweeds in a morgue?

328
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,790
华生 形势所迫 也只能这样了
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.

329
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,910
再见 夫人
Ma'am.

330
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,990
- 要知道 我参加了运动  - 什么运动?
- I'm part of a campaign, you know.  - Oh, campaign?

331
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,790
- 女权运动  - 您是支持还是反对?
- Votes for women.  - And are you for or against?

332
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,060
出去
Get out.

333
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,750
哦 他们又都走了吧?
Oh, have they gone off again, have they?

334
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,470
真是不知道那些先生们过的是什么日子
I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.

335
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,470
是啊 那些先生们!
Huh, yes. Those gentlemen!

336
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,790
别担心了
Oh, never you mind.

337
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,770
我差点忘了 这是给你的
Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.

338
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,330
哦
Oh.

339
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,540
哈德森太太 请告诉我丈夫 我今天得晚些回家了
Mrs. Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late,

340
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,550
我有点急事
I have some urgent business.

341
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,110
没出什么事吧?
Is everything all right?

342
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,350
没什么 就是有个朋友要我去帮忙
Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.

343
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,110
天啊 什么朋友?
Oh, dear. What friend?

344
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,950
英国
England.

345
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,690
这也太宽泛了
Well, that's not very specific.

346
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,610
今天是谁在停尸房值班?
Who's on mortuary duty?

347
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,220
- 你知道的  - 总是他
- You know who.  - Always him.

348
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,280
是哪个蠢货这么干的!
Please tell me which idiot did this!

349
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,680
这么做是为了大家的安全
It's for everyone's safety.

350
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,950
这个女人已经死了 她的半个脑袋都不见了
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.

351
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,250
她是不会带来任何危险的
She's not a threat to anyone.

352
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,560
跟她丈夫说这话吧 他就在那边 也已经死了
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.

353
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,830
我认为 无论昨天晚上在莱姆豪斯发生了什么
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think

354
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,000
我们都可以假定 那不是这个死去的女人干的
we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.

355
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,300
有时候 就是会发生奇怪的事情
Stranger things have happened.

356
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,960
比如...?
Such as...?

357
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,440
比如... 就是奇怪的事情嘛
Well... Strange things.

358
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,000
你像个小屁孩一样胡说八道
You're speaking like a child.

359
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,150
这显然是人干的 他在哪?
This is clearly man's work. Where is he?

360
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,520
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

361
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,920
琥珀
Hooper.

362
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,630
说你呢 快去工作!
You, back to work!

363
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,510
猜你又跑来用小伎俩震惊我们了?
So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose?

364
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,950
你有什么想引起我注意的事情吗?
Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention?

365
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:16,790
完全没有 福尔摩斯先生
Nothing at all, Mr. Holmes.

366
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,950
你随时都可以走
You may leave any time you like.

367
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,460
琥珀先生 是我请福尔摩斯先生到这儿来合作办案的
Dr. Hooper, I asked Mr. Holmes to come here. Cooperate.

368
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,880
这是命令
That's an order.

369
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,510
有两个"很有意思的特征"
There are two "features of interest",

370
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,830
你在华生一身的故事里经常这么说
as you are always saying in Dr. Watson's stories.

371
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,190
我从没这么说过
I never say that.

372
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,460
实际上 你经常这么说的
You do, actually, quite a lot.

373
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,450
首先 这确实是艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.

374
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,350
我们可以断定死者身份
She has been categorically identified.

375
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,550
毫无疑问 这就是她
Beyond a doubt, it is her.

376
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,550
那昨晚在莱姆豪斯的又是谁?
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?

377
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,150
那也是艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.

378
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,270
不可能 她死了 就在这里
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.

379
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,670
她丈夫在死前的几秒内 明确地辨认出了她
She was positively identified by her own husband, seconds before he died.

380
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,390
他没理由说谎 也不太可能弄错
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.

381
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,310
马车夫也认得她 毫无疑问就是她
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.

382
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,150
但是她不可能同时出现在两个地方 对吧?
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she?

383
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,430
是的 华生 其中一个是刚死的人 活动范围非常有限
No, Watson, one place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased.

384
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:06,470
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

385
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,130
- 有可能是双胞胎吗?  - 不可能
- Could it have been twins?  - No.

386
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,070
为什么不可能?
Why not?

387
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,790
因为从来不可能是双胞胎
Because it's never twins.

388
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,030
艾米莉亚不是双胞胎 她也没有姐妹
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.

389
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:15,830
她的哥哥四年前死了
She had one older brother who died four years ago.

390
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:19,670
嗯 有可能是那种秘密双胞胎
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.

391
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,270
什么玩意?!
A what?!

392
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,710
秘密双胞胎
A secret twin.

393
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,390
嗯? 你懂的?
Hmm? You know?

394
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,830
无人知晓的双胞胎
A twin that nobody knows about.

395
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,790
这整件事可能都被计划好了
This whole thing could have been planned.

396
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,710
从谋划的那一刻起吗 那她是得多有远见啊
Since the moment of conception. How breathtakingly prescient of her.

397
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,530
- 从来不可能是双胞胎 华生!  - 那你是怎么想的?
- It is never twins, Watson!  - Then what's your theory?

398
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,790
我就直说吧 你怎么了?
More to the point, what's your problem?

399
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,230
- 我 我不知道啊...  - 你这么害怕干嘛?
- I, I don't understand...  - Why were you so frightened?

400
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,750
目前没有任何证据显示是你弄坏了我的细颈瓶
Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter,

401
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,590
还有你为什么要让一个死掉的女人被捕呢?
and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest?

402
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,350
还有一个很有意思的特征
Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.

403
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,110
她指尖上有一抹血迹
A smear of blood on her finger.

404
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,550
有很多种途径会造成这个结果
That could have happened any number of ways.

405
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,550
确实 还有一件事
Indeed. There's one other thing.

406
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,630
早些时候没有这血迹
It wasn't there earlier.

407
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,710
那个东西也是
Neither was that.

408
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,590
你! 
You!

409
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,310
你?
You?

410
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,110
你?!
You?!

411
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,950
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

412
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,270
吞枪而死 子弹穿脑而过...
Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain...

413
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:28,630
脑后被打得干干净净
Back of the head blown clean off.

414
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,590
他怎么可能生还?
How could he survive?

415
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,750
你指的是"她"吧
"She", you mean.

416
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,550
不好意思?
I'm sorry?

417
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,430
不是"他" 是"她"
Not "he", "she".

418
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,950
当然
Yes, yes of course.

419
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,630
谢谢你们提供了这么一个迷人的案子
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.

420
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,670
我破案之后会给你们发电报的 华生 走了
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it. Watson.

421
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,670
枪伤绝对是致死原因
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death,

422
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,230
但还有一些值得推敲的地方
but there are clear indicators of consumption.

423
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,630
不妨验个尸
It might be worth a postmortem.

424
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,670
所有可能获得的信息我们都要拿到
We need all the information we can get.

425
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,470
顶头上司一走 他就变得这么有洞察力了!
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone!

426
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,790
我在某些方面还是很有洞察力的 正像福尔摩斯在其它方面特别瞎一样
I am observant in some ways, just as Holmes is quite blind in others.

427
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,270
真的吗?
Really?

428
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,590
没错 是真的
Yes, really.

429
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:21,750
真神奇... 一个人为了在男人的世界里出人头地竟能这么努力
Amazing... what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.

430
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,270
他为什么那么说?
What's he saying that for?

431
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,750
快去工作!
Get back to work!

432
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,830
福尔摩斯? 你肯定已经有了些头绪了吧?
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?

433
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,090
还没有 水很深啊 华生 水很深
Not yet. These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.

434
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,830
所以我得探得更深
And I shall have to go deeper still.

435
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,790
"直到好几个月后 我们才理出
"It was not for several months that we were to pick up

436
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,590
理出这诡异案子的头绪
the threads of this strange case again.

437
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,630
而且还是在让人意想不到的情况下"
And then under very unexpected circumstances."

438
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,740
五个人 全一样 毫无例外
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.

439
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,590
嘘 拜托 这件事无比重要
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.

440
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,320
什么?
What is?

441
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,250
黄赤交角 我必须得搞明白
The obliquity of the ecliptic. I have to understand it.

442
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,640
是什么东西?
What is it?

443
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,690
我不知道 我正在努力搞懂
I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.

444
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,150
我还以为你什么都知道呢
I thought you understood everything.

445
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,980
当然不是 那是对大脑空间的极大浪费 我只专攻一方面
Of course not, that would be an appalling waste of brain space. I specialise.

446
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,760
那这件事有什么可重要的?
And what's so important about this?

447
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,770
那这五起无聊的谋杀案有什么重要的?
What's so important about five boring murders?

448
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:37,390
不无聊啊 五个人死了 在家里被谋杀 
They're not boring. Five men dead, murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor

449
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,310
地上像婚礼一样撒了米 墙上还写了血字"你"!
like at a wedding, and the word "You" written in blood on the wall!

450
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,160
是她啊 那个新娘 她又出现了
It's, it's her, it's the Bride. Somehow she's risen again.

451
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,130
- 破案了  - 不可能!
- Solved it.  - You can't have solved it!

452
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,990
当然可能了 非常简单
Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.

453
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,150
神秘的瑞可兰提夫人事件
The incident of the mysterious Mrs. Ricoletti, the killer from

454
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,950
那个从坟墓里爬出来的凶手 被各大媒体争相报道 
beyond the grave, has been widely reported in the popular press.

455
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,190
现在人们都用幽灵之为来伪装他们自己
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders as the

456
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,870
无聊的小谋杀 以迷惑愚蠢至极的苏格兰场
work of a ghost, to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.

457
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,430
就是这样 案子破了
There you are, solved.

458
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,350
出门的时候去见哈德森太太一面 她喜欢多一点参与感
Pay Mrs. Hudson a visit on your way out, she likes to feel involved.

459
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,950
你确定?
You sure?

460
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,950
当然了 走吧 华生! 我准备好了
Certainly. Go away. Watson! I'm ready.

461
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,630
戴上帽子 穿好鞋子 我们有重要的约会要赴
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.

462
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:19,070
华生医生不是几个月前就已经搬走了吗?
Didn't Dr. Watson move out a few months ago?

463
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,830
好像是这样
He did, didn't he?

464
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,710
那我这段时间都是在和谁说话?
Who have I been talking to all this time?

465
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,990
我代表愚蠢至极的苏格兰场表示 
Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard,

466
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,310
那把椅子上肯定没有坐人
that chair is definitely empty.

467
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:33,270
是啊 对吧? 这样倒也没什么大碍
It is, isn't it? Works surprisingly well, though.

468
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,260
我本来还以为他有长进了呢
I actually thought he was improving.

469
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,550
你去哪里了?
Ah. Where have you been?

470
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,790
对不起 先生 今天早上我有点不在状态
Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.

471
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:17,430
你连鸡蛋都不会煮吗?!
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?!

472
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,950
这里的火一直都是灭着的 到处都是灰尘
The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere

473
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,530
你在清洗我靴子的时候还差点把它刷坏了
and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.

474
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,190
要不是因为和你们打交道是我妻子的事 我早就自己找你谈了
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff, I would talk to you myself.

475
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,270
我的妻子呢?
Where is my wife?

476
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,460
对不起 先生 夫人已经出门了
Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.

477
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,510
- 出门了? 这么早就出门了?  - 是的 先生
- Out? At this hour of the morning?  - Yes, sir.

478
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,850
您不知道吗 先生?
Did you not know that, sir?

479
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,150
她去哪里了? 她这段时间老是出门
Where did she go? She's always out these days.

480
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,230
您也差不多吧... 先生
Not unlike yourself... sir.

481
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,590
你说什么...?
I'm sorry...?

482
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,270
我只是比较会观察而已 先生
Just observing, sir.

483
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,890
够了 没人要你到处观察
Well, that's quite enough, nobody asked you to be observant.

484
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,110
对不起 先生 我只是想说你们两个最近很少同时在家了 先生
Sorry, sir, I just meant you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.

485
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,510
你越来越无礼了
You are dangerously close to impertinence.

486
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,390
我得和我妻子谈谈 让她要好好和你谈谈
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.

487
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,790
很好 先生 您打算什么时候见她?
Very good, sir. And when will you be seeing her?

488
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,470
你给我听着...
Now, listen...

489
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,390
我差点忘了 先生 有您的电报
Oh, I nearly forgot, sir. A telegram came for you.

490
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:58,960
你忘了?!
You forgot?!

491
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,990
- 不 是我差点忘了  - 你一早上都在干点什么啊?
- No, I nearly forgot.  - What have you been doing all morning?

492
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,870
在杂志上读您新发表的故事啊 先生
Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.

493
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,790
你喜欢吗?
Did you enjoy it?

494
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,750
您为什么从来不写我 先生?
Why do you never mention me, sir?

495
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,270
下去吧
Go away.

496
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,310
- 什么交什么?  - 黄赤交角
- The what of the what?  - The obliquity of the ecliptic.

497
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,590
你让我赶紧过来 我以为是什么重要的事呢
"Come at once," you said. I assumed it was important.

498
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,870
是很重要
It is.

499
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,710
它是地球的赤道和太阳
It's the inclination of the earth's equator to the path of the sun

500
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,660
在黄道上的轨道的夹角
on the celestial plane.

501
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,700
你最近学习挺刻苦啊?
You been swotting up?

502
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,150
- 我为什么要这样?  - 为了让别人觉得你很聪明啊
- Why would I do that?  - To sound clever.

503
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,960
- 我本来就很聪明  - 我懂了
- I am clever.  - Oh, oh, I see.

504
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,330
你懂什么?
You see what?

505
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,800
我推断 我们要去见一个比你还聪明的人
I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.

506
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,750
闭嘴
Shut up.

507
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:02,030
嘘... 
Sh...

508
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,030
对不起 什么? 哦
Sorry, what? Oh.

509
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,950
这是最适合研究人类的地方了
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.

510
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,270
真不错 你真是越长越胖 背都粘在椅子上了
Handy really, as your ever-expanding backside is permanently glued to it.

511
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,570
- 早上好 哥哥  - 夏洛克 华生医生
- Good morning, brother mine.  - Sherlock. Dr. Watson.

512
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,270
你看上去... 气色不错
You look... well, sir.

513
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,620
真的吗? 我感觉我已经胖得不成样子了
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.

514
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,430
说起这个 你吃这么多东西
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption

515
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,110
实在是对你的健康不太好啊
is incredibly injurious to your health.

516
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,880
你的心脏...
Your heart...

517
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,490
- 这种事就不用担心了 华生  - 什么?
- No need to worry on that score, Watson.  - No?

518
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,110
他心脏的部位其实是空空如也
There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.

519
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,990
- 我们家的人都这样   - 我又没有批评你的意思
- It's a family trait.  - Oh, I wasn't being critical.

520
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,070
如过你一直这样的话 先生 你最多再活五年
If you continue like this, sir, I give you five years at the most.

521
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,230
五年? 我们以为我只能活三年的 对吧 夏洛克?
Five? We thought three, did we not, Sherlock?

522
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,550
我还是感觉是四年
I'm still inclined to four.

523
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,470
一直都是这样 你会看 但是你不会观察
As ever, you see but you do not observe.

524
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,950
你看到我眼白部分的变色了吧
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes,

525
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,790
眼角膜附近的这圈脂肪
the visible rings of fat around the corneas.

526
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,800
是的 你说得对 我要改成赌你三年零四个月加十一天
Yes, you're right. I'm changing my bet to three years, four months and 11 days.

527
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,450
打赌?!
A bet?!

528
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,630
我知道你为什么不赞同 华生
I understand your disapproval, Watson,

529
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,190
但是如果他想要和我争的话 他想早点死完全是可以做到的
but if he's feeling competitive, it's perfectly within his power to die early.

530
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,720
- 这个险你就得自己冒了  - 你用自己的生命打赌?
- That's a risk you'll have to take.  - You're gambling with your own life?

531
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,780
这又怎么了? 这比用别的东西打赌有意思多了
Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.

532
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,590
如果你吃那个布丁 我就赌你三年!
Three years flat, if you eat that plum pudding!

533
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,290
成交
Done.

534
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,670
我几天前就想和你见面 谈一谈庄园案的事情
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.

535
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:31,110
我觉得你可能搞不定了
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.

536
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,550
没有啊 我把案子破了
No. I solved it.

537
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,030
- 肯定是亚当吧  - 是的 是亚当
- It was Adams, of course.  - Yes, it was Adams.

538
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,630
都是嫉妒惹的祸 他给皇家天文协会写了一篇论文
Murderous jealousy. He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society

539
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,110
讲的是黄赤夹角
on the obliquity of the ecliptic,

540
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,760
然后他读到了一篇批评他的文章
and then read another that seemed to surpass it.

541
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,990
- 我知道 我读过了  - 你懂了吗?
- I know, I read it.  - Did you understand it?

542
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,550
懂了 我当然看懂了 它挺简单的
Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.

543
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:51,150
不是 我是问你懂不懂嫉妒心
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy?

544
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,110
一个聪明的人很难想象一个比他更聪明的人
It is no easy thing for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.

545
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,030
你叫我过来是专门羞辱我的吗?
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me?

546
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,430
是的
Yes.

547
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,710
当然不是 但这是最有趣的了
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.

548
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,310
那你能不能说清楚你叫我们来到底是...?
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon..?

549
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,110
我们的生活正受到了一个看不到的敌人的威胁
Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.

550
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,150
每天都在威胁着我们
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.

551
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:17,150
这些敌人无处不在... 看不到... 也无法阻挡
These enemies are everywhere... undetected... and unstoppable.

552
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:18,750
社会主义者?
Socialists?

553
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,990
不是社会主义者 医生 不是
Not socialists, Doctor, no.

554
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,470
- 无政府主义者?  - 不是
- Anarchists?  - No.

555
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,910
法国人? 妇女政论者?
The French? The suffragists?

556
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:27,670
有没有不让你疑虑的人群啊?
Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about?

557
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,350
华生医生无比警觉 请详细说明...
Dr. Watson is endlessly vigilant. Elaborate...

558
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,990
不 调查
No. Investigate.

559
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,710
这是我的一个猜测 我需要你去证实
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.

560
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,230
我交给你一个案子
I'm sending you a case.

561
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,030
- 苏格兰人?  - 苏格兰人?!
- The Scots?  - The Scots?!

562
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,310
你知道最近那些关于
Are you aware of recent theories concerning what is

563
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,590
妄想症的理论吗?
known as paranoia?

564
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,470
像是塞尔维亚人
Oh, sounds Serbian.

565
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,030
一位女士会拜访你 卡迈克尔女士
A woman will call on you, Lady Carmichael.

566
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,470
我想让你接受她的案子
I want you to take her case.

567
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,390
但这些敌人 你不告诉我们他们身份的话
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them

568
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,070
我们又如何打败他们?
if you won't tell us about them?

569
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,590
我们不打败他们 我们很可能会输给他们
We don't defeat them. We most certainly lose to them.

570
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:55,920
为什么?
Why?

571
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:01,550
因为他们是对的 而我们错了
Because they are right. And we are wrong.

572
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,390
卡迈克尔女士女士的案子 是什么?
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it?

573
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,150
放心 这案子据对有趣
Rest assured, it has features of interest.

574
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:09,550
- 我从没用过这说法  - 你真的用过
- I never really say that.  - You really do.

575
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,710
那我猜 你早就破案了?
And you've solved it already, I assume?

576
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,870
只是猜想而已 我需要你们跑腿
Only in my head. I need you for the, er, legwork.

577
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,750
为什么不直接告诉我们你的答案?
Why not just tell us your solution?

578
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,350
那样还有什么意思?
And where would be the sport in that?

579
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,710
你愿意吗 夏洛克?
Will you do it, Sherlock?

580
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,970
我保证你会喜欢的
I can promise you a superior distraction.

581

Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.

585
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,030
谢谢你 维尔德
Thank you, Wilder.

586
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,150
一位梅拉斯先生想见您 福尔摩斯先生
Also, a Mr. Melas to see you, Mr. Holmes.

587
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,870
哦 给我五分钟时间 我有个赌要赢
Ah. Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.

588
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,310
十五分钟才行
Better make that 15.

589
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,630
滴答
Ticktock.

590
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,750
福尔摩斯先生 我是来求取您意见的
Mr. Holmes, I have come here for advice.

591
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,910
- 这很容易  - 还有帮助
- That is easily got.  - And help.

592
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,870
这不总那么简单了
Not always so easy.

593
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:06,190
出事了 福尔摩斯先生 一些... 不寻常
Something has happened, Mr. Holmes, something... unusual

594
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,600
并且... 吓人的事
and... terrifying.

595
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,430
那你走运了
Then you are in luck.

596
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,890
走运?!
Luck?!

597
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:14,610
那些是我的专长 嗯 看起来很有意思啊
Those are my specialisms. Hmm, this is really very promising.

598
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,790
福尔摩斯...
Holmes...

599
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:20,070
请吧... 告诉我们何事让您如此烦心
Please... do tell us what has so distressed you.

600
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,790
我 我费心想了很久该怎么做
I, I thought long and hard as to what to do,

601
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,790
然后突然想到我的丈夫
but then it occurred to me that my husband was

602
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,310
与您的哥哥相识 或许通过他...
an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him...

603
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,390
其实 我不确定这是否与您的领域相关 福尔摩斯先生
The fact is, I'm not sure this comes within your purview, Mr. Holmes.

604
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,590
哦?
No?

605
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,470
上帝保佑 我认为这可能该请教牧师
Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.

606
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,710
你上午作何打算 亲爱的?
And what does your morning threaten, my dear?

607
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,450
是开心地刺绣呢?
A vigorous round of embroidering?

608
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,610
还是在女帽商那里有个恼人的约会?
An exhausting appointment at the milliners?

609
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,470
我希望你是在说笑 尤斯塔斯
I hope you are teasing, Eustace.

610
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,650
怎么了?
What is it?

611
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,530
尤斯塔斯?
Eustace?

612
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,630
丹尼尔 索菲 出去玩吧
Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.

613
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,860
但是 妈妈...
But, Mama...

614
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,650
听妈妈的话 快去
Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.

615
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,830
尤斯塔斯 这是什么意思?
Well, Eustace, what does this mean?

616
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,670
死亡
Death.

617
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,000
什么?
What?

618
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,050
它意味着死亡
It means death.

619
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,750
呃 没什么 这没什么
Er, nothing, it's, er, it's nothing.

620
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,910
我... 误会了
I was... mistaken.

621
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,790
亲爱的 你脸色变得苍白
My dear, you've gone quite pale.

622
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,460
都说了没什么!
It's nothing!

623
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:57,990
- 尤斯塔斯...  - 信封您留着吗?
- Eustace...  - Did you keep the envelope?

624
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,550
我丈夫毁掉了 但信封是空的
My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.

625
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,710
没有名字地址什么的
No name or address of any kind.

626
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,270
告诉我 尤斯塔斯爵士去过美国吗?
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America?

627
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,630
- 没有  - 你们结婚前也没有?
- No.  - Not even before your marriage?

628
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,470
- 据我所知没有  - 嗯
- Well, not to my knowledge.  - Hmm.

629
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,670
请继续您的精彩讲述吧
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.

630
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,150
这件事发生在星期一早晨
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.

631
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,870
两天后的星期三 我丈夫才第一次见到她
It was two days later on the Wednesday that my husband first saw her.

632
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,920
谁?
Who?

633
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,550
尤斯塔斯?
Eustace?

634
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,950
她来找我了 路易莎!
She's come for me, Louisa!

635
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:41,870
上帝啊 救救我 我的罪恶找上门来了!
Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out!

636
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,500
谁来找你了? 尤斯塔斯 你吓到我了
Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.

637
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,370
快看 快看!
Well, look, look!

638
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,150
你没看到她吗?
Don't you see her?

639
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,170
没 我没看到有人
No, I see no-one.

640
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,830
走了
Gone.

641
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,830
你瞒了我很多秘密 这是另一个吗?
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another?

642
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,990
你看到谁了?
Who have you seen?

643
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,660
是她!
It was her!

644
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,270
是那个新娘!
It was the Bride!

645
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,950
而你什么也没看到?
And you saw nothing?

646
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,190
什么也没有
Nothing.

647
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,820
- 你丈夫有没有描述...?  - 没有 直到今天早晨
- Did your husband describe...?  - Nothing, until this morning.

648
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,130
尤斯塔斯?!
Eustace?!

649
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,600
尤斯塔斯?!
Eustace?!

650
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,300
尤斯塔斯?
Eustace?

651
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,840
尤斯塔斯?!
Eustace?!

652
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,070
该死!
Blast!

653
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,630
尤斯塔斯?!
Eustace?!

654
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,230
你在哪里? 是我啊!
Where are you? It's me!

655
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,510
# 请不要忘记我 #
# Do not forget me #

656
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,990
# 请不要忘记我 #
# Do not forget me #

657
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,590
# 记住那个女孩 #
# Remember the maid #

658
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:42,070
# 那个磨坊里的女孩... #
# The maid of the mill... #

659
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,470
你是谁?
Who are you?

660
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,600
我命令你报上名来
I demand you speak, who are you?!

661
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,680
尤斯塔斯 看在上帝的份上 和我说话啊!
Eustace, speak to me. In the name of God!

662
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,770
她...
She's...

663
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,980
她是艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
She is Emelia Ricoletti.

664
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,000
不 不要啊
No, not you.

665
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,690
不...
No...

666
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,590
求你了!
Please!

667
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:37,070
今夜 尤斯塔斯・卡迈克尔 你就会死掉!
This night, Eustace Carmichael, you will die!

668
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,390
- 福尔摩斯?  - 安静点 华生
- Holmes?  - Hush, Watson.

669
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,150
可是那个新娘 艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.

670
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,670
- 你知道她的大名?  - 你得原谅华生
- Well, you know the name?  - You must forgive Watson,

671
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,150
他就喜欢陈述明显的事实 对此近乎狂热
he has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious, which borders on mania.

672
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,070
请问一下你丈夫今天早上状态如何?
May I ask, how is your husband this morning?

673
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:19,350
他不愿意谈起那件事
He refuses to speak about the matter.

674
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,250
你也能想到 我把他赶出家门了
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.

675
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,950
不 他得待在原处才行
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.

676
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,710
你不觉得他现在有危险吗?
Well, you don't think he's in danger?

677
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,960
当然 有人明显想要杀掉他 但这对我们有利
Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to kill him, but that's good for us.

678
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,750
舍不得孩子套不住狼
You can't set a trap without bait.

679
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,840
我的丈夫可不是诱饵 福尔摩斯先生
My husband is not bait, Mr. Holmes.

680
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,410
没错 但要是我们用对方法 他就能变成诱饵
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.

681
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,070
听着 你得马上回家
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.

682
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:37,110
我和华生医生会赶下一趟火车跟上
Dr. Watson and I will follow on the next train.

683
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,090
时间不等人 尤斯塔斯爵士今晚就要死了
There's not a moment to lose, Sir Eustace is to die tonight.

684
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,660
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

685
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,390
我们应该... 大概可以救他吧
And we should... probably avoid that.

686
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,510
- 肯定  - 肯定可以救下他
- Definitely. - Definitely avoid that.

687
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,950
我的弟弟已经接下了这个案子
Little brother has taken the case, of course.

688
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,430
我现在需要你去打探情况
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things,

689
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,990
但绝不能让他发现你是跟我一伙的
but he must never suspect you are working for me.

690
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,990
明白了吗 华生?
Are you clear on that, Watson?

691
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,470
就交给我吧 福尔摩斯先生
You can rely on me, Mr. Holmes.

692
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,390
- 你不该...  - 我确实不该 你也一样
- You don't suppose...  - I don't and neither should you.

693
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,030
我话还没说完呢
You don't know what I was going to say.

694
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,910
你是想说这件事中可能有超自然的因素
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency

695
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,610
而我打算嘲笑你一番
involved in this matter. And I was about to laugh in your face.

696
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,630
可是福尔摩斯 那位新娘艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提又出现了
But the Bride, Holmes, Emelia Ricoletti again.

697
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,100
已逝去的女人死而复生了
A dead woman walking the earth.

698
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,890
- 你真是让我惊讶 华生  - 是吗?
- You amaze me, Watson.  - I do?

699
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,370
你什么时候有的想象力啊?
Since when have you had any kind of imagination?

700
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,570
大概就从我让读者大众相信
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that

701
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:34,370
某个没原则的瘾君子是个绅士英雄之后吧
an unprincipled drug addict was some kind of gentleman hero.

702
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:37,450
你既然说到了 我得说那确实挺了不起的
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.

703
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,170
不过你可以放心 这个世上并没有鬼
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.

704
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,010
除了一些我们自己闹出来的
Save those we make for ourselves.

705
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,930
你刚刚说什么?
Sorry, what did you say?

706
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,020
我们自己闹出来的鬼 是什么意思?
Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean?

707
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,850
梦游症
Somnambulism.

708
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,600
你说什么?
I beg your pardon?

709
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,970
我会梦游 仅此而已 这是个再普通不过的症状了
I sleepwalk, that's all. It's a common enough condition.

710
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,730
你是个医生连这个都不知道!
I thought you were a doctor!

711
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,850
这一切都是个... 噩梦
The whole thing was a... bad dream.

712
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,430
你收到的那个信封里的东西也是吗?
Including the contents of the envelope you received?

713
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,670
那是个怪诞的恶作剧罢了
Well, that's a grotesque joke.

714
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,570
你给你的妻子感觉可不是这样 先生
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.

715
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,860
- 她是个癔病患者 异想天开  - 不
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.  - No.

716
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,010
- 不好意思 你刚刚说什么?  - 我说她不是个癔病患者
- I'm sorry, what did you say? - I said no, she's not an hysteric.

717
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,330
她是位有着超凡洞察力的高智商女人
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.

718
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,090
我的妻子看见一个橙子核都害怕
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.

719
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,250
你的妻子能看到别人看不到的世界
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see

720
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,930
还有其中有价值的东西
anything of value whatsoever.

721
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,130
真的吗?
Can she really?

722
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,210
那你是怎么"推断"出这个的呢 福尔摩斯先生?
And how do you "deduce" that, Mr. Holmes?

723
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,650
她嫁给了你
She married you.

724
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,570
所以我想她应该找到了特别的原因才是
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.

725
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,130
我今晚会尽全力救你一命 
I'll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would

726
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,050
但你最好先解释一下你和瑞可兰提案件的联系
help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.

727
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,650
瑞可兰提?
Ricoletti?

728
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,130
是的 请详细说明
Yes. In detail, please.

729
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,810
我从来没有听说过这个女人
I've never heard of her.

730
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,130
那就有意思了 我可从来没说过她是个女人
Interesting. I didn't mention she was a woman.

731
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,210
我们告辞了 但愿明天早上还能再见到你
We'll show ourselves out. I hope to see you again in the morning.

732
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,440
不可能了
You will not.

733
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,350
那就遗憾了 我就等着破你的谋杀案吧 日安
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder. Good day.

734
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,440
好歹你试过了
Well, you tried.

735
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,010
能麻烦你将这个交给卡迈克尔夫人吗 谢谢
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this. Thank you.

736
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,310
- 午安  - 没问题 先生
- Good afternoon.  - Certainly, sir.

737
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,380
那是什么东西?
What was that?

738
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,680
今晚卡迈克尔夫人
Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight,

739
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,520
会因为头剧痛而独睡
upon the pretence of a violent headache.

740
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,960
房子的所有门窗都会上锁
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.

741
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,760
你觉得幽灵 不 新娘
Ha! You think the spectre, er, Bride,

742
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,280
会再来把尤斯塔斯爵士引诱到外面去吗?
will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again?

743
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,600
当然了 要不这威胁预告还有什么意思?
Certainly. Why else the portentous threat?

744
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,720
- "今夜你就会死掉!"  - 他肯定不会跟着她走的吧?
- "This night you will die!"  - Well, he won't follow her, surely?

745
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,400
很难说他究竟会怎样做
Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.

746
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,160
- 愧疚正在啮噬他的灵魂  - 愧疚? 他有什么可愧疚的?
- Guilt is eating away at his soul.  - Guilt? About what?

747
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,560
他对过去的事心怀愧疚 那些橙子核让他想起了过去
Something in his past. The orange pips were a reminder.

748
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,590
- 那不是个恶作剧吗?  - 根本不是
- Not a joke?  - Not at all.

749
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,260
橙子核是一种用来预示复仇死亡的经典方法 源于美国
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death, originating in America.

750
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,760
尤斯塔斯爵士非常了解这一点
Sir Eustace knows this only too well,

751
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,040
他也知道自己要受到惩罚了
just as he knows why he is to be punished.

752
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,160
这和艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提有什么关系吗?
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti?

753
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,840
我想是的 人人都有不堪的过去 华生 至于鬼魂
I presume. We all have a past, Watson. Ghosts.

754
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,120
他们是为了衬托那些阳光灿烂的日子而存在的阴霾
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.

755
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,960
尤斯塔斯爵士知道他已经被盯上了
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.

756
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,760
他所恐惧的绝不是有人想谋杀他那么简单
There's something more than murder he fears.

757
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,000
他对自己将要被瑞可兰提夫人死而复生的亡灵
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse

758
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,520
拖入地狱这件事情深信不疑
of the late Mrs. Ricoletti.

759
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,460
刚才纯粹是胡说 对吧?
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?

760
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:25,140
当然啦 你带左轮枪了吗?
God, yes. Did you bring your revolver?

761
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,450
对付鬼魂 左轮枪有什么用?
What good would that be against a ghost?

762
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,140
- 是没用 那你带了吗?  - 带了 当然带了
- Exactly. Did you bring it?  - Yeah, of course.

763
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,130
那就来吧 华生 来吧 游戏已经开始了
Then come, Watson, come. The game is afoot.

764
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,780
- 坐下 华生 真是的!  - 对不起 我有点抽筋
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake!  - Sorry. Cramp.

765
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,570
- 灯还点着吗?  - 是的
- Is the lamp still burning?  - Yes.

766
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,220
尤斯塔斯爵士睡下了
There goes Sir Eustace.

767
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,510
卡迈克尔女士也是
And Lady Carmichael.

768
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,630
整个屋子都睡了
The house sleeps.

769
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,030
上帝啊 这绝对是我这辈子度过的最漫长的夜晚
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.

770
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,750
耐心点 华生
Have patience, Watson.

771
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,150
才刚十二点
Only midnight.

772
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,550
我发现 我们很少一起这么坐着
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.

773
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,190
说得没错 这姿势对膝盖非常不好
I should hope so. It's murder on the knees.

774
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,350
两个老朋友说说话 闲聊几句
Two old friends just talking. Chewing the fat.

775
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,010
男人之间的对话
Man-to-man.

776
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,830
看起来 这个女人很值得尊敬
So, a remarkable woman.

777
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,990
- 哪个?  - 卡迈克尔女士
- Who?  - Lady Carmichael.

778
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:37,630
女性这个方面一直是你的专长 华生
The fair sex is your department, Watson.

779
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,820
所以我就相信你说的
I'll take your word for it.

780
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,240
你喜欢她这种类型的 "一个具有超凡洞察力的女人"
Well, you liked her. "A woman of rare perception."

781
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:45,070
还有非常高的足弓 我从她进屋的步伐里注意到这点
And admirably high arches. I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.

782
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,270
- 是的 我觉得他配不上她  - 你也这么觉得吗?
- Huh, she's far too good for him.  - You think so?

783
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,830
不 但你是这么想的 我看得出来
No. You think so. I could tell.

784
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,520
恰恰相反 我在这件事情上不抱任何观点
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.

785
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,190
你绝对有
Yes, you have.

786
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:56,870
- 我并不会细想婚姻的问题  - 为什么?
- Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.  - Oh, why not?

787
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:57,930
你今天晚上是怎么了?
What's the matter with you this evening?

788
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,050
你带着的那块怀表 表盖里面有一张照片
That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.

789
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:04,670
我有一次不小心看到了 我相信那应该是艾琳・艾德勒
I glimpsed it once. I believe it is of Irene Adler.

790
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,770
你那不叫不小心看到 你是蓄意等到我睡着了
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep

791
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,130
- 然后翻出来看的  - 好吧 没错
- and looked at it.  - Yes, I did.

792
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,390
- 你真的以为我不会发现吗?  - 艾琳・艾德勒
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice?  - Irene Adler.

793
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,710
值得尊敬的对手 非同寻常的经历
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.

794
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,050
- 还有心旷神怡的照片  - 你为什么用这种口气说话?
- A very nice photograph.  - Why are you talking like this?

795
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,810
- 你为什么坚决要一直单身呢?  - 你没毛病吧 华生?
- Why are you so determined to be alone?  - Are you quite well, Watson?

796
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,690
- 这个问题很奇怪吗?  - 如果是个维也纳精神病医生问 不奇怪
- Is it such a curious question?  - From a Viennese alienist, no.

797
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,720
但是从一个退役的军医嘴里问出来 非常奇怪
From a retired Army surgeon, most certainly.

798
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,160
福尔摩斯 应该没人能反驳这一点
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever,

799
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,490
- 我是你最好的朋友  - 我同意这点
- I am your closest friend.  - I concede it.

800
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,170
现在我正尝试着和你
I am currently attempting to have

801
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,370
用一种非常正常的方式对话
a perfectly normal conversation with you.

802
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:37,740
- 别这样说话  - 你为什么要一直单身呢?
- Please don't.  - Why do you need to be alone?

803
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,610
如果你指的是个人情感纠葛方面的事情 华生
If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson,

804
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,830
我觉得你就是 那么我以前经常这么解释
which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before,

805
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,860
我厌恶所有的情感
all emotion is abhorrent to me.

806
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:47,610
就像精密仪器里漏进的沙子
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.

807
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,630
- 透镜上的裂痕一样  - 透镜里的裂痕 没错
- The crack in the lens.  - The crack in the lens. Yes.

808
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,860
既然这样 看吧 我早就告诉过你
Well, there you are, you see, I've said it all before.

809
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,070
不 那些是我写的
No, I wrote all that.

810
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,130
你在引用杂志上刊登的小说里的"你"说的话
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.

811
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,460
- 是啊 没错  - 那些是我说的 不是你说的!
- Well, exactly.  - Those are my words, not yours!

812
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,660
那是我向公众展现的你 不是真正的你
That is the version of you that I present to the public.

813
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,740
没有人性的大脑 精妙的计算机器
The brain without a heart. The calculating machine.

814
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,110
那些都是我社稷出来的 福尔摩斯 读者们愿意接受这个
I write all of that, Holmes, and the readers lap it up.

815
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,310
但我不相信你是这样的人
But I do not believe it.

816
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:10,790
好吧 那我应该得写信告诉你的编辑
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.

817
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,380
你是个活生生的 会喘气的人
You are a living, breathing man.

818
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,820
- 你也有自己的生活 自己的过去  - 什么?
- You've lived a life, you have a past.  - A what?!

819
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,100
- 你肯定有过一个...  - 有过什么?
- Well, you must have had...  - Had what?

820
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:20,180
- 你懂的  - 不懂
- You know.  - No.

821
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,180
一些经验
Experiences.

822
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,740
把你的手枪给我 我突然觉得需要用一下
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.

823
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:29,150
该死的 福尔摩斯 你也有血有肉 有感情 你有...
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood, you have feelings, you have...

824
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,270
你肯定有... 某些冲动
You must have... impulses.

825
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,030
天啊 我从没这么急切地想被杀人鬼袭击了
Dear Lord, I have never been so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost.

826
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,380
作为你的朋友 作为一个关心你的人...
As your friend, as someone who worries about you...

827
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,880
是什么把你变成这样的?
what made you like this?

828
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,850
哦 华生...
Oh, Watson...

829
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,110
没有人能改变我
Nothing made me.

830
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,990
我就是我
I made me.

831
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,720
红胡子?
Redbeard?

832
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,670
上帝啊!
Good God!

833
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,980
我们该怎么办?
What are we to do?

834
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,560
我们去和她聊聊吧
Why don't we have a chat?

835
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,220
瑞可兰提夫人 是你吧!
Mrs. Ricoletti, I believe!

836
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,740
真是个令人愉快的夜晚啊 不是吗?
A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not?

837
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,020
这不是真的 福尔摩斯 不可能是真的!
It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!

838
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,340
没错 这不是真的
No, it can't.

839
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,740
- 锁上了吗?  - 就像之前布置的那样
- Is it locked?  - As per instruction.

840
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,660
那是窗户被打碎的声音 对吧?
That was a window breaking, wasn't it?

841
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,400
我们只需要关心一扇特定的窗户是否被打碎了
There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.

842
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,990
- 待在这里 华生  - 什么? 不行
- Stay here, Watson.  - What? No.

843
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:57,310
所有的门窗都已经锁上了
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.

844
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,310
这是他们唯一的出路 我需要你守在这!
This is their only way out, I need you here!

845
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,450
但那声音离得很近 肯定是从房子的这一侧传来的
But the sound was so close. It had to be from this side of the house.

846
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:02,170
待在这里!
Stay here!

847
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,830
哦!
Oh!

848
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,270
不!
No!

849
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,790
你说过会保证他的安全的 你保证过!
You promised to keep him safe. You promised!

850
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,060
你...
You...

851
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,900
你是人 我知道的
You're human, I know that.

852
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,090
你肯定是
You must be.

853
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:08,420
我们这样在黑暗中站着也没什么意思
Little use us standing here in the dark.

854
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,580
毕竟现在都是十九世纪了
After all, this is the 19th century.

855
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,860
请不要忘记我!
Do not forget me!

856
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,500
请不要忘记我!
Do not forget me!

857
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:10,820
华生!
Watson!

858
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,710
- 她就在那! 就在那下面!  - 别告诉我你扔下那里不管了!
- She's there! She's down there!  - Don't tell me you abandoned your post!

859
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,530
什么? 福尔摩斯 她就在那里 我看见她了!
What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her!

860
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,730
没人了 都怪你!
Empty, thanks to you!

861
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,120
凶手跑了!
Our bird is flown!

862
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,890
不! 不 福尔摩斯 不是你想的那样的
No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.

863
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,260
我看见她了! 她是鬼!
I saw her! The ghost!

864
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:29,540
根本就没有鬼!
There are no ghosts!

865
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:36,090
出什么事了? 尤斯塔斯爵士呢?
What happened? Where is Sir Eustace?

866
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,700
死了
Dead.

867
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,970
你要知道 这事真的不怪你
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.

868
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,170
- 你说得对  - 很高兴你想明白了
- No, you're quite right.  - I'm glad you're seeing sense.

869
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,540
华生也有做的不对的地方
Watson is equally culpable.

870
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,940
我们本来可以破了这个案子的
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.

871
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:54,860
我答应过要保护好那个人的
I gave an undertaking to protect that man,

872
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,060
可是现在他却被一把匕首捅死了
now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.

873
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,940
其实你是答应了要调查他的谋杀案
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.

874
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,290
我本来有信心 认为事情不会发展成这样!
In the confident expectation I would not have to!

875
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:05,330
你有什么发现吗 医生?
Anything you can tell us, Doctor?

876
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,540
杀他的人用了不小的力气
Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.

877
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,660
- 所以凶手应该是个男人?  - 有可能
- It's a man, then?  - Possibly.

878
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,500
匕首非常锋利 所以也可能是女人吧?
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman?

879
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,100
理论上讲 没错 但是我们知道凶手是谁了 我看到她了
In theory, yes, but we know who it was, I saw her.

880
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,020
- 华生!  - 我看到鬼了 我亲眼看到的!
- Watson!  - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes!

881
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,460
你什么都没看见! 你看见的是你以为应该看见的东西!
You saw nothing! You saw what you were supposed to see!

882
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,380
你自己都说了 我没什么想象力
You said yourself, I have no imagination.

883
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,350
那就动动脑子 排除所有不可能的情况 去观察剩下的线索
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible,

884
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,840
在这个案子里 鬼就是不可能出现的情况 
which in this case is the ghost, and observe what remains,

885
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:30,180
而剩下的线索就是破案的关键
which in this case is a solution

886
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,300
只需要简单的观察就行了 这可是雷斯垂德都会的事!
so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out!

887
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:33,340
多谢!
Thank you!

888
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,660
别再想什么另一个世界的鬼怪了!
Forget spectres from the other world!

889
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,300
只有一个人有作案的动机和机会
There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.

890
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,700
- 他们可能也会留下什么讯息  - 他们确实留下了信息
- They might as well have left a note.  - They did leave a note.

891
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,060
还有另一扇被打破的窗户
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.

892
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,420
- 什么另一扇窗户?  - 没错! 没有别的了
- What other broken window?  - Precisely! There isn't one.

893
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,660
只有我和华生进来的时候打破了一扇窗户
The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through,

894
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,500
可是 在那之前 我们确实听到了...
yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of...

895
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,870
- 你刚才说什么?  - 什么?
- What did you just say?  - Sorry?

896
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,760
讯息之类的 你刚才说什么来着?
About a note, what did you just say?

897
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:56,460
- 我说凶手确实留下了信息  - 没有啊
- I said the murderer did leave a note.  - No, they didn't.

898
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,300
匕首上系着一张留言 你没看见吗!
There's a message tied to the dagger. You must have seen it!

899
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,980
- 没有留言啊  - 有的!
- There's no message.  - Yes!

900
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,380
我发现尸体的时候并没有留言啊
There was no message when I found the body.

901
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:20,500
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

902
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,420
写了什么?
What is it?

903
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,900
你想吗?
Do you?

904
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,260
想什么?
Do I what?

905
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,540
你... 你是怎么拿到留言的?
How... how did you get that?

906
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,140
我把它留在犯罪现场了
I left it at the crime scene.

907
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,940
"犯罪现场"? 你从来学来的这些好听的说法
"Crime scene"? Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

908
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:00,660
你想他吗?
Do you miss him?

909
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,060
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty is dead.

910
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,460
可是呢...?
And yet...?

911
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,420
他的尸体从来没被找到过
His body was never recovered.

912
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,700
对于一个被人推下瀑布的数学教授 这是有可能的
To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.

913
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,580
真实的理由常被戏剧性的表象所掩盖
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.

914
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,220
你的生命也得以保全
Your life in a nutshell.

915
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,660
你是从哪学来的这些好听的说法?
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions?

916
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,480
你的体重又长了吗?
Have you put on weight?

917
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,860
你昨天才来看过我的 有可能吗?
You saw me only yesterday. Does that seem possible?

918
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,020
- 不可能  - 可是我的体重确实长了
- No.  - Yet here I am, increased.

919
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,950
由此可以看出 我们英国最优秀的侦探也不过如此吧?
What does that tell the foremost criminal investigator in England?

920
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,860
英国?
In England?

921
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,220
你陷得很深 夏洛克 比你想象的更深
You're in deep, Sherlock, deeper than you ever intended to be.

922
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,460
- 你列出清单了吗?  - 什么清单?
- Have you made a list?  - Of what?

923
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,260
所有的线索 我们需要一个清单
Everything. We will need a list.

924
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,500
真棒
Good boy.

925
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,380
不行 我还没写完
No, I haven't finished yet.

926
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,420
莫里亚蒂可能不会赞同
Moriarty may beg to differ.

927
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,300
他是在转移我的注意力 让我分心
He's trying to distract me. To derail me.

928
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,820
没错
Yes.

929
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,140
他就是透镜上的裂痕 粥里的老鼠屎
He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment,

930
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,860
数据中的病毒
the virus in the data.

931
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,020
我要结束这一切
I have to finish this.

932
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:30,340
如果莫里亚蒂真的在莱辛巴赫瀑布死里逃生了的话
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron,

933
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,870
他会自己找上门来的
he will seek you out.

934
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,160
那我就等着他
I'll be waiting.

935
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,540
好吧
Yes.

936
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,860
我猜你也会等他
I'm very much afraid you will.

937
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:32,190
他像这样已经两天了
Two days he's been like that.

938
00:53:33,340 --> 00:53:35,820
- 他吃东西了吗?  - 没有 一口都没吃
- Has he eaten?  - No, not a morsel.

939
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:40,700
媒体今天都跑出来了 外面现在还有记者围着呢
Press are having a ruddy field day. There's still reporters outside.

940
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,070
他们一直在那待着 我赶都赶不走
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.

941
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,230
我一直忙着给他泡茶
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.

942
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,990
你为什么要给他泡茶?
Why do you make him tea?

943
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,590
我也不知道 就是想这么做
I dunno, I just sort of do.

944
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,140
他说"只有一个嫌疑人" 然后就走了
He said, "There's only one suspect," and then he just walks away

945
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,380
什么也不肯解释
and now he won't explain.

946
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,540
这真奇怪 毕竟他挺喜欢这样的
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.

947
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,140
他还说这案子简单得我都能想明白
Said it was so simple I could solve it.

948
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,860
我确定他把事情夸大了
I'm sure he was exaggerating.

949
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,100
你觉得他在干什么呢?
What's he doing, do you think?

950
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,580
- 他说他在等待  - 等待什么?
- He says he's waiting.  - For what?

951
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:15,220
那个恶魔 我不觉得惊奇
The devil. I wouldn't be surprised.

952
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,020
在这里万事皆有可能
We get all sorts here.

953
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,140
- 有什么进展就发电报给我  - 好的
- Well, wire me if there's any change.  - Yeah.

954
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,990
我要说的话你都已经想到了
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.

955
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,780
那么我的答案你也许也想到了
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.

956
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,880
就像一颗子弹
Like a bullet.

957
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,980
这个习惯很危险啊
It's a dangerous habit,

958
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:24,420
把手指扣在上膛的手枪扳机上 揣在晨衣口袋里
to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

959
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,210
还是说你很高兴见到我呢?
Or are you just pleased to see me?

960
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:35,140
- 请原谅 我需要自我防卫  - 你不自我防卫才让我生气呢
- You'll forgive me for taking precautions.  - I'd be offended if you didn't.

961
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:38,830
很明显 出于礼貌我也有防卫
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.

962
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:51,790
我喜欢你的房间 闻起来很有...
I like your rooms. They smell so...

963
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,160
男人味
manly.

964
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:58,740
我相信你早就对它够熟悉了吧
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.

965
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:02,700
对啊 你总不在家 出去斯特兰德大街上冒险
Well, you are always away, on your little adventures for The Strand.

966
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,500
告诉我 你会带着画师出门吗?
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you?

967
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,990
推理的时候... 要不要摆个造型?
Do you have to pose... during your deductions?

968
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,820
我知道你趁我不在的时候
I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments

969
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,620
- 来过我的公寓六次  - 我知道你知道
- during my absence.  - I know you are.

970
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,160
顺便说一句 你的床真是舒适无比
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.

971
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:26,170
你知不知道灰尘大部分是由人体皮肤组成的?
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin?

972
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:28,100
知道
Yes.

973
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:31,950
尝起来味道不一样 你得保持皮肤水分
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.

974
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:34,470
- 有点脆  - 要坐下吗?
- Just a little crispy.  - Won't you sit down?

975
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,750
人们就是这样 
That's all people really are, you know,

976
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,470
四处散布人体灰尘
dust waiting to be distributed.

977
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,190
弄得到处都是 
And it gets everywhere. Ugh.

978
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:43,030
每呼吸一下 灰尘就在阳光下飞舞
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam,

979
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:45,350
一群精疲力竭的人们
all the used-up people.

980
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,370
引人注目 我知道 你能坐...
Fascinating, I'm sure. Won't you sit...

981
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,720
人们 人们 人们! 总是弄脏身边的东西
People, people, people! Can't keep anything shiny.

982
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,440
你不介意我开枪吧?
Do you mind if I fire this?

983
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,100
清理一下枪膛
Just to clean it out.

984
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,140
没错 咱们别互相戏弄了
Exactly, let's stop playing.

985
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,940
我们不需要用玩具杀死对方
We don't need toys to kill each other.

986
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,280
- 那样就显示不出咱们的亲密了  - 坐下
- Where's the intimacy in that?  - Sit down.

987
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,480
- 为什么? 你想怎样?  - 你选择了来这里
- Why? What do you want?  - You chose to come here.

988
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,270
才不是 你知道不是这样
Not true, you know that's not true.

989
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,410
你想要什么 夏洛克?
What do you want, Sherlock?

990
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,380
真相
The truth.

991
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,010
这样啊 真相太无聊了!
That. Truth's boring!

992
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,810
你没想到我会在犯罪现场现身吧?
You didn't expect me to turn up at the scene of the crime, did you?

993
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:42,290
可怜的尤斯塔斯老爵士 报应来了挡不住
Poor old Sir Eustace. He got what was coming to him.

994
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:43,940
但是杀了他的不可能是你
But you couldn't have killed him.

995
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:47,500
那又怎样? 有什么大不了的? 省省吧 省省
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it. Stop this.

996
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:50,220
你才不关心尤斯塔斯 那个新娘 什么都不关心
You don't care about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or any of it.

997
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:53,820
整个案件勾起你兴趣的只有一件事
There's only one thing in this whole business that you find interesting.

998
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,260
我知道你在干什么
I know what you're doing.

999
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,630
新娘把枪放到嘴里打爆了半个脑袋
The Bride put a gun in her mouth and shot the back of her head off

1000
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:01,980
然后又复活了
and then she came back.

1001
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:07,180
不可能 但是她复活了
Impossible. But she did it.

1002
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,910
你想知道她是怎么做到的
And you need to know how.

1003
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:10,950
怎么做到的?
How?

1004
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:11,810
没错吧?
Don't you?

1005
00:58:12,270 --> 00:58:14,510
不知道真相 搅得你心烦意乱
It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.

1006
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:20,200
你在试图阻止我... 让我分心 误导我
You're trying to stop me... To distract me, derail me.

1007
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:22,280
这案子不会让你联想到另外一个案子吗?
Because doesn't this remind you of another case?

1008
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,700
这案子以前没发生过吗?
Hasn't this all happened before?

1009
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:28,210
人世间的事总是翻来覆去 是哪一个案子?
There's nothing new under the sun. What was it?

1010
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,180
哪一个? 哪一个案子呢?
What was it? What was that case? Huh?

1011
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,660
你还记得吗?
Do you remember?

1012
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,890
话已经到嘴边了 话已经到嘴边了
It's on the tip of my tongue. It's on the tip of my tongue.

1013
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,530
话已经到嘴边了
It's on the tip of my tongue.

1014
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:42,030
话已经到...
It's on the tip...

1015
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,290
嘴边了
of my tongue.

1016
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,010
为了哈德森太太的墙纸着想 我要提醒你一下
For the sake of Mrs. Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you

1017
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,730
一不小心动了手指 你就死定了
that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.

1018
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,730
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

1019
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:06,670
死亡... 才是性感新潮流
Dead... is the new sexy.

1020
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:19,370
你猜怎么着 我的头脑清醒了不少
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.

1021
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:21,950
- 你怎么可能会活着?  - 我看起来怎么样?
- How can you be alive?  - How do I look?

1022
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,850
你说实话 这个伤口明显吗?
You can be honest, is it noticeable?

1023
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,090
你的脑袋都炸开了 怎么还能活下来?
You blew your own brains out, how could you survive?

1024
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:35,490
也许可以把头发朝上梳
Or maybe I could backcomb.

1025
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:36,770
我看到你死了
I saw you die.

1026
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,590
你为什么没死?
Why aren't you dead?

1027
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,690
因为杀死你的不是瀑布 夏洛克
Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.

1028
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,950
只有你才知道 不是瀑布
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall,

1029
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,960
根本不是瀑布
it's never the fall.

1030
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,570
是降落!
It's the landing!

1031
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,970
我们已经降落了 先生 我们已经降落了
We've landed, sir. We've landed.

1032
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,840
不 不 现在不行 现在不行!
No, no, not now, not now!

1033
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,670
现在不行 现在不行
Not now, not now.

1034
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,430
您的旅程很愉快吧 先生?
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir?

1035
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,580
旅程比我们想象的要短 亲爱的弟弟
Well, a somewhat shorter exile than we'd imagined, brother mine,

1036
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,830
但考虑到您的强迫症 旅程也足够了 
but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.

1037
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,030
- 我要回去!  - 什么?
- I have to go back!  - What?

1038
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,910
我... 已经接近了 我已经接近答案了! 
I was... I was nearly there, I nearly had it!

1039
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,510
你到底在说什么?
What on earth are you talking about?

1040
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,540
回去? 你根本没走多远
Go back where? You didn't get very far.

1041
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,330
瑞可兰提和他那可恶的老婆! 你们听不懂吗?!
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?!

1042
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,490
我们当然听不懂 你根本就在胡扯 夏洛克
No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.

1043
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,910
这是个100年前的著名案件
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.

1044
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,150
保存在我的硬盘里 她看起来已经死了 但是又复活了
Lodged in my hard drive, she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.

1045
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:46,280
什么 就像莫里亚蒂那样?
What, like Moriarty?

1046
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,170
她对着头部开枪 完全和莫里亚蒂一样
Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.

1047
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:49,500
但是你才刚知道
But you've only just been told.

1048
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:52,530
我们也是刚刚才知道 现在电视上都在说他
We've only just found out, he's on every TV screen in the country.

1049
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,370
是吗? 然后呢? 自从迈克罗夫特打电话来已经过了五分钟了
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.

1050
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,470
你们有什么进展吗? 你们都在干什么?
What progress have you made? What have you been doing?

1051
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:59,310
更重要的是 你在干什么?
More to the point, what have YOU been doing?

1052
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:00,640
我在我的思维宫殿里
I've been in my Mind Palace, of course.

1053
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:00,960
当然
Of course.

1054
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,770
我在进行思想实验 我如过在1895年的话
Running an experiment. How would I have solved the crime,

1055
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:06,800
- 我会怎么破案  - 夏洛克啊
- if I'd been there in 1895?  - Oh, Sherlock.

1056
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,160
所有的细节我都搞清楚了
I had all the details perfect.

1057
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,360
我就在那里 一切都在 我沉浸在里面
I was there, all of it, everything. I was immersed.

1058
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,560
当然如此
Of course you were.

1059
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:15,140
你一直在读约翰的博客 你们相遇的故事
You've been reading John's blog. The story of how you met.

1060
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:18,400
有时候用他的眼光看问题对我还是有帮助的
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.

1061
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,720
我聪明多了
I'm so much cleverer.

1062
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,680
你觉得有谁会信你吗?
Do you really think anyone is believing you?

1063
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,040
不 他会这个 我看他做过
No, he can do this, I've seen it.

1064
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,240
思维宫殿 就好像他的脑海里有一整个世界
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.

1065
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,200
是的 我需要重新回去
Yes, and I need to get back there.

1066
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,920
思维宫殿是一种记忆技巧 我知道它能用来做什么
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do

1067
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,680
我也知道它肯定不能用来做什么
and I know what it most certainly cannot.

1068
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,500
也许有几件事在我们两个之间只有我知道
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.

1069
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,540
肯定有 你列清单了吗?
Oh, there are. Did you make a list?

1070
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,750
你胖了不少 你的背心比外套要新
You've put on weight. That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.

1071
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,950
别说了! 别说了! 你列过清单了吗?!
Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?!

1072
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:51,300
什么清单?
Of what?

1073
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,500
都要 夏洛克 你吸的所有东西
Everything, Sherlock. Everything you've taken.

1074
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,020
不是那个 他有时候会出神 我看到过
No, it's not that, he goes into a sort of trance. I've seen him do it.

1075
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,880
我和我弟弟有一个协议 自从那天起
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.

1076
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:17,240
不管我在哪里找到他 不管是小巷还是豪宅...
Wherever I find him, whatever back alley or doss-house...

1077
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,040
他都能给我一个清单
there will always be a list.

1078
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,230
他总不会花了五分钟就把那些全吸掉了吧
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.

1079
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,720
- 他上飞机之前已经飘飘欲仙了  - 他看上去还挺正常的啊
- He was high before he got on the plane.  - He didn't seem high.

1080
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,440
- 没有人比吸毒的人更会骗人  - 我没有成瘾 我只是随便吸吸
- Nobody deceives like an addict.  - I'm not an addict, I'm a user.

1081
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,200
我用它来找点乐子 有时候帮助我思考
I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.

1082
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,800
天啊! 这些会杀了你的!
For God's sake! This could kill you!

1083
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,680
- 你会死的!  - 有节制地吸毒就不会死了
- You could die!  - Controlled usage is not usually fatal

1084
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,040
而且不吸毒也不代表永生
and abstinence is not immortality.

1085
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,120
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

1086
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,800
艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提 我在搜索她
Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.

1087
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,200
我也觉得应该查一下
Oh, I suppose we should.

1088
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,000
我可以看得到军情五处的机密文件
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.

1089
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,800
我看的就是那个
Yep, that's where I'm looking.

1090
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,040
你觉得军情五处的安全系统怎么样?
What do you think of MI5 security?

1091
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,480
要是有就好了
I think it would be a good idea.

1092
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,020
艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提 "未解决" 他说得没错
Emelia Ricoletti, "unsolved", like he says.

1093
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,840
你们能不能就闭嘴五分钟! 我必须要回去
Could you all just shut up for five minutes! I have to go back.

1094
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:09,840
你来打扰我之前我已经快好了
I was nearly there before you stepped on and started yapping away!

1095
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,160
"打扰?" 对不起 我们打扰到你了吗?
"Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session?

1096
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,800
- 夏洛克 听我说  - 不 它只会鼓励你
- Sherlock, listen to me.  - No, it only encourages you.

1097
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,760
- 我没生你的气  - 太好了!
- I'm not angry with you.  - Oh, that's a relief!

1098
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,160
我还很怕... 等等 其实我一点都不担心
I was really worried... No, hold on, I really wasn't.

1099
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,130
我以前也陪着你
I was there for you before.

1100
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:25,530
我现在也会陪着你
I'll be there for you again.

1101
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,120
我一直都会陪着你
I'll always be there for you.

1102
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,400
这是我的错
This was my fault.

1103
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,000
这和你没关系
It was nothing to do with you.

1104
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,140
在监狱里待了一个礼拜 我应该早点注意到的
A week in a prison cell, I should have realised.

1105
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:40,080
- 注意到什么?  - 你的情况是
- Realised what?  - That, in your case,

1106
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,680
你一个人把自己锁起来 和你的宿敌在一起
solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.

1107
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,080
- 天啊!  - 吗啡还是可卡因?
- Oh, for God's sake!  - Morphine or cocaine?

1108
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,800
- 你说什么?  - 我什么都没说
- What did you say?  - I didn't say anything.

1109
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,640
不 你说过 你说过...
No, you did, you said...

1110
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:56,590
"今天是哪种? 吗啡还是可卡因"
"Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine."

1111
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,200
"福尔摩斯?"
"Holmes?"

1112
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,640
吗啡和可卡因... 你今天注射了哪种?
Morphine or cocaine... which is it today?

1113
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,860
回答我 该死!
Answer me, damn it!

1114
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:07,940
莫里亚蒂刚刚在这里
Moriarty was here.

1115
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,000
莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty's dead.

1116
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,880
- 我刚刚在一架喷气式飞机上  - 什么?
- I was on a jet.  - A what?

1117
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,480
你也在 还有迈克罗夫特
You were there, and Mycroft.

1118
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,600
你没有离开过这个房间 福尔摩斯
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.

1119
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,640
你... 没有... 动过
You... haven't... moved.

1120
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,720
好了 告诉我 吗啡还是可卡因?
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine?

1121
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,400
可卡因 7%的溶液
Cocaine. A 7% solution.

1122
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:34,440
- 你想试试吗?  - 不想
- Would you care to try it?  - No.

1123
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,800
不过我倒想找到剩下的那些药
But I would quite like to find every ounce of the stuff

1124
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,080
然后把它们倒在外面
in your possession and pour it out of the window.

1125
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,680
我应该阻止你的
I should be inclined to stop you.

1126
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,400
那你就得记得了
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly,

1127
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:46,800
我们中谁是当兵的 谁是吸毒的
which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.

1128
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,760
你不是士兵 你是个医生
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.

1129
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:49,960
我是随军医生
I'm an army doctor,

1130
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,880
我可以一边打烂你的骨头 一边叫出它们的名字
which means I could break every bone in your body while naming them.

1131
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,880
亲爱的华生 你让情绪影响了你的判断力
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.

1132
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,800
从来不在破案的时候吸毒
Never on a case.

1133
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,680
你保证过我的 永远不在破案的时候吸毒
You promised me, never on a case.

1134
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:03,260
不 我只是在你写的故事里这么说过
No, I just said that in one of your stories.

1135
01:05:03,290 --> 01:05:06,950
听着 我很乐意当你的丑角
Listen, I'm happy to play the fool for you.

1136
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,670
我可以在你身边装成是个傻子
I will run along behind you like some halfwit,

1137
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:11,830
让你看上去聪明一点 如果你需要这样的话
making you look clever, if that's what you need.

1138
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:16,550
但是天啊 你得对自己要求高一点!
But dear God above, you will hold yourself to a higher standard!

1139
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:18,550
- 为什么?  - 因为人们需要你这样
- Why?  - Because people need you to.

1140
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,750
什么人 为什么? 是因为你那些白痴的故事吗?
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories?

1141
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,950
是的 就是因为我那些"白痴的故事"
Yes, because of my "idiot stories".

1142
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:24,750
福尔摩斯先生!
Mr. Holmes!

1143
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,580
福尔摩斯先生 有电报 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes, telegram, Mr. Holmes.

1144
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,470
这是什么? 怎么了?
What is it? What's wrong?

1145
01:05:38,470 --> 01:05:40,710
- 是玛丽  - 玛丽? 她怎么了?
- It's Mary.  - Mary? What about her?

1146
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,110
- 她很有可能有危险  - 有危险?
- It's entirely possible she's in danger.  - Danger?

1147
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:47,110
- 没有时间浪费了  - 你是可卡因注射多了吗?
- There's not a moment to lose.  - Is this the cocaine talking?

1148
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,470
玛丽能有什么危险?
What danger could Mary be in?

1149
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:50,690
她应该是在拜访朋友吧
I'm sure she's just visiting with friends.

1150
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,460
走了!
Come on!

1151
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,830
出什么事了? 你现在清醒着吗?
What is happening? Are you even in a fit state?

1152
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:04,070
玛丽出事了 当然清醒 不要怀疑 华生
For Mary, of course. Never doubt that, Watson.

1153
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,870
不要怀疑我的神智
Never that.

1154
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:07,510
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

1155
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,790
我没事 我没事!
I'm fine. I'm fine!

1156
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:11,910
别戴那个!
Not that one!

1157
01:06:13,030 --> 01:06:14,910
戴这个
This one.

1158
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,510
- 为什么?  - 你是夏洛克・福尔摩斯 把这该死的帽子戴上
- Why?  - You're Sherlock Holmes. Wear the damn hat.

1159
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,350
马车! 马车!
Cab! Cab!

1160
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:32,030
告诉我 她在哪?
So tell me, where is she?

1161
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:33,990
你必须告诉我 怎么回事?!
You must tell me, what's going on?!

1162
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,270
行了 亲爱的华生!
Oh, good old Watson!

1163
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:37,750
你什么时候能闭嘴不问问题?!
How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?!

1164
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,270
夏洛克 快说我的老婆在哪里 你这自负的混蛋
Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is, you pompous prick,

1165
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,990
不然我把你打开花!
or I'll punch your lights out!

1166
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,830
福尔摩斯 她在哪?
Holmes, where is she?

1167
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:48,790
在个不怎么神圣的教堂里
A de-sanctified church.

1168
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,950
她觉得她找到答案了 而且没有更好的解释了
She thinks she's found the solution and, for no better reason than that,

1169
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,670
她把自己处于了危境之中
she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.

1170
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,590
真是会选妻子
What an excellent choice of wife.

1171
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,150
见鬼?!
What the devil?!

1172
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,470
我找到他们了
I've found them.

1173
01:07:19,630 --> 01:07:22,830
- 到底怎么回事 玛丽?  - 这里是他们的老巢 约翰
- What is all this, Mary?  - This is the heart of it all, John.

1174
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,670
整个阴谋的核心
The heart of the conspiracy.

1175
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:46,990
老天爷啊 这是个什么地方?
Great God, what is this place?

1176
01:07:46,990 --> 01:07:49,070
你到底在这里干什么?!
And what the devil are you doing here?!

1177
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:51,390
我一直在查案
I've been making enquiries.

1178
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:53,070
是福尔摩斯先生的指令
Mr. Holmes asked me.

1179
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,350
福尔摩斯 你怎么能这样?
Holmes, how could you?

1180
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,950
不是他 是聪明的那个
No, not him, the clever one.

1181
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:00,550
很明显这个案子无法一个人实施
It seemed obvious to me that this business could not be managed alone.

1182
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:03,150
我认为是有人帮了瑞可兰提夫人
My theory is that Mrs. Ricoletti had help.

1183
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:04,670
是她的朋友们帮了她
Help from her friends.

1184
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:06,750
- 干得漂亮 玛丽  - "聪明的那个?" 我...
- Bravo, Mary.  - "The clever one?" I...

1185
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,350
我还以为我要失去你了
I thought I was losing you.

1186
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,790
我以为我们...
I thought perhaps we were...

1187
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:15,310
- 正在冷战  - 搬出去住的是你
- neglecting each other.  - Well, you're the one who moved out.

1188
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:16,710
我在和玛丽说话
I was talking to Mary.

1189
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:19,790
你在为迈克罗夫特做事?
You're working for Mycroft?

1190
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:21,910
他喜欢照顾他那有点不正常的弟弟
He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.

1191
01:08:21,910 --> 01:08:24,270
然后就找了个间谍 你从没有怀疑过
And he had a spy to hand. Has it never occurred to you

1192
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:26,330
你的妻子对于护士的职业过分娴熟吗?
your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse?

1193
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,870
当然不会 因为他知道护士都有什么能力
Of course it hasn't, because he knows what a nurse is capable of.

1194
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,150
- 你什么时候怀疑过?  - 大概只有现在吧
- When did it occur to you?  - Only now, I'm afraid.

1195
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:35,670
当一个迟钝的弟弟一定很不好过吧
Must be difficult, being the slow little brother.

1196
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,230
时间不等人 话说够了 干正事吧
Time I sped up. Enough chatter, let's concentrate.

1197
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:40,430
对啊 这是怎么回事?
Yes, all right. What's all this about?

1198
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:44,110
- 他们想要干什么?  - 去看看不就行了
- What do they want to accomplish?  - Why don't we go and find out.

1199
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,790
抱歉! 看到锣我就手痒
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.

1200
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,670
- 抗拒不了对戏剧的向往  - 真是想不到!
- Or a touch of the dramatic.  - Never have guessed!

1201
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,830
看来大家和我一样努力
Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.

1202
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,070
精彩绝伦
Excellent.

1203
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:15,430
上好的演出
Superlative theatre.

1204
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,470
真该为你们的表演鼓掌
I applaud the spectacle.

1205
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,230
艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提朝自己开了枪
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself,

1206
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,630
接着又从墓中复活 杀死了自己的丈夫
then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.

1207
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:28,750
所以...
So...

1208
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,030
怎么做到的呢?
how was it done?

1209
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,910
让我来理一理事情经过
Let's take the events in order.

1210
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:38,710
瑞可兰提夫人巧妙地吸引了所有人的注意
Mrs. Ricoletti gets everyone's attention in very efficient fashion.

1211
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,310
你!
You!

1212
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,150
你?!
You?!

1213
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:45,910
还是我?
Or me?

1214
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:47,910
她把一把左轮手枪放进了嘴里
She places one of the revolvers in her mouth,

1215
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,150
实际上开的是朝向地面的那把枪
while actually firing the other into the ground.

1216
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:52,150
一个同伙朝窗帘上泼出血液
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood

1217
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:53,550
因此楼下惊慌的众人
and thus her apparent suicide

1218
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,110
见证了她的自杀
is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.

1219
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,470
一具与瑞可兰提夫人非常相似的尸体
A substitute corpse, bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs. Ricoletti

1220
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:03,150
代替了她的位置 并随后被转移到停尸间
takes her place and is later transported to the morgue,

1221
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:06,390
小小的自杀案件不受伦敦警察局过多关注
a grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.

1222
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:10,150
与此同时 真正的瑞可兰提夫人溜走了
Meanwhile, the real Mrs. Ricoletti slips away.

1223
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,550
接下来是最聪明的作案手段
Now comes the really clever part.

1224
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,390
瑞可兰提夫人说服了一个认识她的马车夫
Mrs. Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her,

1225
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:22,910
去她丈夫常去的鸦片馆外拦住了他
to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.

1226
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,310
在完美的舞台上完成了完美的表演
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.

1227
01:10:26,350 --> 01:10:27,990
你是谁? 你想怎样?
Who are you? What do you want?

1228
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,590
艾米莉亚?
Emelia?

1229
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:32,830
来人!
Help!

1230
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:35,030
凶手指认确凿无比
A perfect positive identification.

1231
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,270
这位瑞可兰提夫人从墓中爬了出来
The late Mrs. Ricoletti has returned from the grave

1232
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,190
只需要一点点技术性的化妆
and a little skilled make-up

1233
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:41,870
整个案件 只有复仇的鬼魂才说得通
and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.

1234
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:57,430
剩下只有一件事要做了
There was only one thing left to do.

1235
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,190
快动手吧 不要哭
Swiftly now. No tears.

1236
01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:06,710
只需要把瑞可兰提夫人真正的尸体
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs. Ricoletti

1237
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:08,310
和停尸间里的替换即可
for the corpse in the morgue.

1238
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:11,150
这时候 不管是谁去指认
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her,

1239
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:13,590
那尸体绝对就是艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
it would be positively, absolutely her.

1240
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:15,550
但是她为什么那么做?
But why would she do that?

1241
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,190
为了一具尸体而自杀?
Die to prove a point?

1242
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:19,510
欲成一事必有牺牲
Every great cause has martyrs.

1243
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:23,990
每场战争必有敢死之行 没错 这是一场战争
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.

1244
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:26,670
一半的人类都在这个军队中对抗着另一半
One half of the human race at war with the other.

1245
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:31,550
一只看不见的军队在我们身边徘徊
The invisible army hovering at our elbow,

1246
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,590
支撑着我们的家园
tending to our homes,

1247
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:34,910
抚养着我们的后代
raising our children.

1248
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,670
被无视 被施舍
Ignored, patronised,

1249
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,270
被漠视
disregarded.

1250
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,910
连选举权都不允许享有
Not allowed so much as a vote.

1251
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,670
尽管如此 一个军队
But an army nonetheless,

1252
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:57,670
已抱着最大的善意准备崛起
ready to rise up in the best of causes.

1253
01:11:57,670 --> 01:12:01,710
去匡正那些如人性本身一般古老的不公
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.

1254
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:06,910
你明白了吧 华生 迈克罗夫特是对的
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.

1255
01:12:06,910 --> 01:12:08,710
这一战我们必败
This is a war we must lose.

1256
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:10,070
她快死了
She was dying.

1257
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:13,510
- 谁?  - 艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提
- Who was?  - Emelia Ricoletti.

1258
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:16,170
她有很明显的肺结核表征
There were clear signs of consumption...

1259
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,030
我怀疑她原本就时日不多了
I doubt she was long for this world.

1260
01:12:18,030 --> 01:12:20,230
所以她决定让自己死得其所
So she decided to make her death count.

1261
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,430
她对美国的秘密社团已经很熟悉了
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.

1262
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:27,270
她也有能力用她们惊吓
And was able to draw on their methods of fear

1263
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:29,630
和恐惧的方式公开地
and intimidation to publicly, very publicly,

1264
01:12:29,630 --> 01:12:32,950
让尤斯塔斯・卡迈克尔直面自己过去的罪恶
confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.

1265
01:12:32,950 --> 01:12:34,590
他是在美国认识她的
He knew her out in the States.

1266
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:38,710
向她承诺了一切
Promised her everything.

1267
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:40,910
婚姻 地位
Marriage, position.

1268
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:45,310
然后他占有了她...
And then he had his way with her...

1269
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:48,230
又把她抛弃了
and threw her over.

1270
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,110
令她孓然一人 身无分文
Left her abandoned and penniless.

1271
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:52,350
琥珀!
Hooper!

1272
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,870
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

1273
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:03,350
我得说一句 福尔摩斯 她可没糊弄到我
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.

1274
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,510
你为什么从来没提起过我呢 先生?
Why do you never mention me, sir?

1275
01:13:13,030 --> 01:13:17,110
艾米莉亚以为她会在瑞可兰提那里找到幸福
Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti,

1276
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,760
但是他也是一个畜生
but he was a brute too.

1277
01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:27,930
艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提是我们的朋友
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.

1278
01:13:27,930 --> 01:13:30,530
你不知道那个混蛋是怎么对她的
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.

1279
01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:35,810
但是那个新娘 福尔摩斯 我们看到她了
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.

1280
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,970
是的 华生 我们确实看到了
Yes, Watson, we did.

1281
01:13:37,970 --> 01:13:39,890
玻璃碎裂的声音是吗?
The sound of breaking glass?

1282
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:41,770
并不是窗户
Not a window,

1283
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:43,970
只是一个老式的剧场小伎俩
just an old theatrical trick.

1284
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:47,210
- 不可能 福尔摩斯 这不可能  - 不 这不可能
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot!  - No, it can't.

1285
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,770
这叫做佩珀尔幻象
It's called Pepper's Ghost.

1286
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:54,970
简单地在玻璃上反射出活人的影像
A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.

1287
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:59,930
她们犯下的唯一错误就是在移动它的时候把它打碎了
Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.'

1288
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,490
看看你们周围
Look around you.

1289
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,610
这间屋子里全是新娘
This room is full of brides.

1290
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:14,530
一旦她要出现
Once she had risen,

1291
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,970
任何人都可以是她
anyone could be her.

1292
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:20,170
那个复仇的鬼魂
The avenging ghost.

1293
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:22,930
晴天霹雳般的恐惧直射进
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man

1294
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,850
恶意满满的男人心里
with malicious intent.

1295
01:14:24,850 --> 01:14:27,490
一个纠缠那些未受惩罚
A spectre to stalk those unpunished brutes

1296
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,530
却早该遭末日审判的畜生的鬼魂
whose reckoning is long overdue.

1297
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:33,610
复仇女神的联盟觉醒了
A league of furies awakened.

1298
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:35,290
我...
The women I...

1299
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:37,930
我们欺骗 背叛过的女人
we have lied to, betrayed.

1300
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,730
我们无视或者贬低过的女人
The women we have ignored and disparaged.

1301
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:52,850
一旦这个念头出现
Once the idea exists,

1302
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,090
就无法消除
it cannot be killed.

1303
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:58,450
这是一心一意的人才能干出的事
This is the work of a single-minded person.

1304
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:02,890
一个最直接感知尤斯塔斯精神虐待的人
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.

1305
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:05,170
这个幽暗的秘密
The dark secret,

1306
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:07,330
只有她最亲密的朋友们知道
kept from all but her closest friends,

1307
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,050
包括艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提...
including Emelia Ricoletti...

1308
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,490
她丈夫多年前对不住的女人
the woman her husband wronged all those years before.

1309
01:15:14,970 --> 01:15:17,610
如果一个人不理会鬼魂
If one disregards the ghost,

1310
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:19,170
那么就只有一个嫌疑人
there is only one suspect.

1311
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:22,810
对吗 卡迈克尔夫人?
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?

1312
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:28,690
然而有一个小细节我不是很明白
One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.

1313
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:36,010
为什么要让我阻止一个你想要犯下的罪行?
Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit?

1314
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,170
嗯?
Hmm?

1315
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:41,170
说不怎么通啊 说不怎么通啊
Doesn't quite make sense, doesn't quite make sense.

1316
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,610
当然说不通 并不是真的
Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.

1317
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:46,130
夏洛克
Oh, Sherlock.

1318
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,850
躲猫猫
Peek-a-boo.

1319
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,170
不
No.

1320
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:54,890
不 不是你
No, not you.

1321
01:15:56,090 --> 01:15:57,330
不可能是你
It can't be you.

1322
01:15:57,330 --> 01:15:59,850
来嘛 严肃点嘛
I mean, come on, be serious.

1323
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:02,370
服装 铜锣?
The costumes, the gong?

1324
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,250
作为一个犯罪大师
Speaking as a criminal mastermind,

1325
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,330
我们实际上并没有铜锣或者特殊的服装
we don't really have gongs or special outfits.

1326
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:10,410
到底发生了什么事?
What the hell is going on?

1327
01:16:12,090 --> 01:16:13,810
这对你来说够蠢了吗?
Is this silly enough for you yet?

1328
01:16:15,210 --> 01:16:18,410
够哥特吗? 对你来说够疯狂吗?
Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you?

1329
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:22,390
说不通啊 夏洛克 因为并不是真的
It doesn't make sense, Sherlock, because it's not real.

1330
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,810
- 一个都不是  - 他在说什么?
- None of it.  - What's he talking about?

1331
01:16:25,810 --> 01:16:27,370
因为这些都是你想象出来的
This is all in your mind.

1332
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:30,190
夏洛克?
Sherlock?

1333
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,230
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

1334
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,330
你在做梦
You're dreaming.

1335
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:35,930
他在做梦吗?
Is he dreaming?

1336
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:39,850
醒过来了
And there he is.

1337
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:41,490
有那么一会儿 还以为我们要失去你了
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.

1338
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:44,570
我可以检查下吗 这就是你说的"控制用量"?
May I just check, is this what you mean by "controlled usage"?

1339
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:47,610
艾米莉亚・瑞可兰提夫人 我必须知道她埋在哪里
Mrs. Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.

1340
01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:51,130
- 什么 120年前?  - 是的
- What, 120 years ago?  - Yes.

1341
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,090
哪怕记录存在的话 也得找好几个星期呢
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.

1342
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,210
- 就算是用我的资源  - 找到了
- Even with my resources.  - Got it.

1343
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:00,530
我不明白 这有什么关联嘛?
I don't get it, how is this relevant?

1344
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:02,370
我必须知道自己是正确的 这样我才能确信
I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.

1345
01:17:02,370 --> 01:17:03,810
- 你是指莫里亚蒂是怎么做到的吗?  - 是的
- You mean how Moriarty did it?  - Yes.

1346
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,130
但是这些统统没有发生 全是你想象出来的
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.

1347
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:07,650
我在大脑中调查排演
My investigation was the fantasy,

1348
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:09,490
案件发生如我所料
the crime happened exactly as I explained.

1349
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:11,530
墓碑是她的一群朋友立的
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.

1350
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:13,160
我不知道你在这能查出什么
I don't know what you think you'll find here.

1351
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:14,660
我要试一试!
I need to try!

1352
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,050
瑞可兰提夫人是埋在这的 那另外一个呢?
Mrs. Ricoletti was buried here, but what happened to the other one?

1353
01:17:25,050 --> 01:17:28,090
那具代替她"自杀"的尸体呢?
The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide?

1354
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,370
- 当然被他们移走了  - 但是去哪了?
- They'd move it, of course they would.  - But where?

1355
01:17:30,370 --> 01:17:31,970
肯定不是在这
Well, not here.

1356
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:34,290
但是... 这事一定得有人去做
But that... That's exactly what they must have done.

1357
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:36,210
作案者们一定有内应帮他们
The conspirators had someone on the inside.

1358
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:39,170
他们找到了一具尸体 就好比那次茉莉・琥珀给我找了一具...
They found a body, just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when...

1359
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:41,570
好吧 这事就不用再说一遍了
Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we?

1360
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:43,250
你不会真想这么做吧?
You're not seriously going to do this?

1361
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,490
要不然我们来这里干什么 我得知道真相
It's why we came here. I need to know.

1362
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,930
典型的瘾君子症状
Spoken like an addict.

1363
01:17:46,930 --> 01:17:49,770
- 这对我很重要!  - 不 这说明你需要治疗!
- This is important to me!  - No, this is you needing a fix.

1364
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,170
- 约翰...  - 莫里亚蒂回来了
- John...  - Moriarty's back.

1365
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,790
咱们还有案子 当下有个真真实实的问题存在着
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.

1366
01:17:53,820 --> 01:17:56,300
我知道 这事等一下解决 我要先把这事做好
Getting to that, it's next on the list. Just let me do this.

1367
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,540
不 大家总是随你想干什么就干什么
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.

1368
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,340
- 所以你才会变成这样!  - 约翰 拜托了...
- That's how you got in this state!  - John, please...

1369
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:02,600
这次我不干了 夏洛克 我不干了!
I'm not playing this time, Sherlock. Not any more!

1370
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,430
等你准备开始工作了 再联系我
When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.

1371
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,230
- 我要带玛丽回家了  - 你要干什么?
- I'm taking Mary home.  - You're what?

1372
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:09,030
- 玛丽带我回家  - 这还差不多
- Mary's taking me home.  - Better.

1373
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:13,230
- 他说得对  - 他对又怎样?!
- He's right, you know.  - So what if he's right?!

1374
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,670
他总是有道理 有什么意思!
He's always right, it's boring!

1375
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,870
你会帮我吗?
Will you help me?

1376
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,270
找出那个女人
Cherchez la femme.

1377
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:10,310
瞧瞧呀
Oh, dear.

1378
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,550
空空如也
The cupboard is bare.

1379
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:15,790
他们一定埋在下面了
They must have buried it underneath.

1380
01:19:15,790 --> 01:19:18,550
他们一定是埋在棺材下面了
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.

1381
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,830
运气不好啊 夏洛克
Bad luck, Sherlock.

1382
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,830
也许他们用了别的办法处理尸体
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.

1383
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:39,260
很有可能
No... More than likely.

1384
01:19:39,590 --> 01:19:41,510
不管怎样 这是很久以前的事了
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.

1385
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,870
我们确实还有更要紧的事要做 兄弟
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother.

1386
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,190
莫里亚蒂? 死而复生?
Moriarty? Back from the dead?

1387
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:51,270
# 请不要忘记我 #
# Do not forget me. #

1388
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:55,870
# 请不要忘记我! #
# Do not forget me! #

1389
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:11,070
这里?
This?

1390
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:12,310
我明白了
Oh, I see.

1391
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:15,710
我还没醒呢?
Still not awake, am I?

1392
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,990
太深了 夏洛克 实在太深了
Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.

1393
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:47,830
恭喜 你将成为史上第一个
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history

1394
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,950
被埋葬在自己记忆宫殿的人
to be buried in his own Mind Palace.

1395
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:54,780
这个背景设置有点夸张了 不是吗?
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think?

1396
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:56,110
对于你和我来说?
For you and me?

1397
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:58,710
一点都不夸张
Not at all.

1398
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,420
你到底是什么人?
What are you?

1399
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,420
你知道我是什么人
You know what I am.

1400
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:07,260
我是莫里亚蒂
I'm Moriarty.

1401
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:08,980
犯罪界的拿破仑
The Napoleon of Crime.

1402
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,420
- 莫里亚蒂已经死了!  - 在你的心里可没死
- Moriarty's dead!  - Not in your mind.

1403
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,660
在那里我永远不会死
I'll never be dead there.

1404
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:16,540
你有次把你的大脑叫做硬盘
You once called your brain a hard drive.

1405
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:18,190
那就和我这个病毒打个招呼吧
Well, say hello to the virus.

1406
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:21,030
这就是咱俩的结局
This is how we end, you and I.

1407
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:24,220
永远在这里
Always here,

1408
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,550
永远在一起
always together.

1409
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:31,220
你有个精妙绝伦的大脑 莫里亚蒂
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.

1410
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,100
我很欣赏
I admire it.

1411
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:36,740
我承认你的大脑甚至比得上我自己的大脑
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.

1412
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,110
我很感动
I'm touched.

1413
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:41,780
我很荣幸
I'm honoured.

1414
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:44,380
但是说到在悬崖边缘
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat

1415
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:46,410
徒手搏斗...
on the edge of a precipice...

1416
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:50,140
你才是掉进瀑布的那一个
you're going in the water,

1417
01:21:50,150 --> 01:21:52,420
小矮个
short-arse.

1418
01:22:04,110 --> 01:22:06,780
你觉得你很高大强壮吗 夏洛克!
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock!

1419
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,290
我可不这么想
Not with me.

1420
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:23,580
我是你的弱点!
I am your weakness!

1421
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:27,180
我压制了你!
I keep you down!

1422
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,170
你的每一次差错 每一次失败
Every time you stumble, every time you fail,

1423
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,690
在你虚弱之时
when you're weak,

1424
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,850
我... 就...
I... am...

1425
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:37,340
出现了!
there!

1426
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,210
不 
No,

1427
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:42,930
别想挣扎了
don't try to fight it.

1428
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,500
躺好接受失败!
Lie back and lose!

1429
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,770
要不要一起跳下去?
Shall we go over together?

1430
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,530
永远在一起 不是吗?
It has to be together, doesn't it?

1431
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:57,810
结局永远都是你
At the end it's always just you

1432
01:22:57,820 --> 01:22:59,730
还有我!
and me!

1433
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,850
教授 如果你不介意离我的朋友远一点的话
Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend,

1434
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:11,140
他应该不会觉得你那么烦人了
I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.

1435
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:16,570
这不公平 你们有两个人!
That's not fair, there's two of you!

1436
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:18,860
我们两个总是在一起 你难道没看过杂志上连载的故事吗?
There's always two of us. Don't you read The Strand?

1437
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:22,420
跪下 教授
On your knees, Professor.

1438
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,220
双手抱头
Hands behind your head.

1439
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,740
多谢了 约翰
Thank you, John.

1440
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,260
你从什么时候开始叫我约翰了?
Since when do you call me John?

1441
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:37,930
你会感到吃惊的
You'd be surprised.

1442
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,220
那倒不会
No, I wouldn't.

1443
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,220
你该醒过来了 夏洛克
Time you woke up, Sherlock.

1444
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,770
我是写故事的人 我在故事里的时候 自己会知道的
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.

1445
01:23:47,780 --> 01:23:49,610
没错
Of course.

1446
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:50,940
你当然会知道 约翰
Of course you do, John.

1447
01:23:51,980 --> 01:23:53,410
那么 他是什么样的?
So what's he like?

1448
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:55,780
另一个世界里的另一个我?
The other me in the other place?

1449
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,050
比看起来要聪明
Smarter than he looks.

1450
01:23:59,060 --> 01:24:00,500
那就是非常聪明了
Pretty damn smart, then.

1451
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:03,210
确实非常聪明
Pretty damn smart.

1452
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:06,970
天啊 你们俩怎么不干脆私奔了算了!
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?!

1453
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,730
这话太难听了
Impertinent.

1454
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:10,450
我也觉得被冒犯了
Offensive.

1455
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:13,090
你介不介意我来处理?
Actually, would you mind?

1456
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,260
当然不介意
Not at all.

1457
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,410
- 也该轮到我了  - 确实
- It was my turn.  - Quite so.

1458
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:28,020
你打算怎么醒过来?
So how do you plan to wake up?

1459
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,730
呃...
Oh...

1460
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,180
我想应该这样
I should think like this.

1461
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:36,730
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

1462
01:24:36,740 --> 01:24:39,930
和你在一起的时候 我总能死里逃生
Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.

1463
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:41,180
可是要怎么做?
But how?

1464
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:44,300
用演绎法 亲爱的华生
Elementary, my dear Watson.

1465
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:18,210
- 想我了吗?  - 夏洛克 你还好吗?
- Miss me?  - Sherlock, are you all right?

1466
01:25:18,220 --> 01:25:19,890
当然了 为什么会不好?
Yes. Of course I am, why wouldn't I be?

1467
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,530
因为你可能用药过量了 你应该去医院
Because you probably just OD'd. You should be in hospital.

1468
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,250
没时间了
Hm, no time.

1469
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:26,810
我必须马上回贝克街 莫里亚蒂又出现了
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.

1470
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:31,300
如果他能让你别吸毒了 我倒是有点希望他回来了
I almost hope he is, if it'll save you from this.

1471
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,810
不需要这个了 还有更实际的案子等着我
No need for that now, I've got the real thing.

1472
01:25:36,820 --> 01:25:38,540
- 我还有工作  - 夏洛克...
- I have work to do.  - Sherlock...

1473
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:41,460
答应我
promise me.

1474
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,570
你还在这里干什么?
What are you still doing here?

1475
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:46,970
你难道不应该像个懂事的哥哥一样
Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something,

1476
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:48,220
去给我弄个赦免令之类的吗?
like a proper big brother?

1477
01:25:53,380 --> 01:25:54,700
华生医生...
Dr. Watson...

1478
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,140
请照顾好他
look after him.

1479
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,260
拜托了
Please.

1480
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,690
夏洛克 等等 你解释一下 莫里亚蒂还活着吗?
Sherlock, hang on, explain. Moriarty's alive, then?

1481
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:28,810
我从来没说他还活着 我说他又出现了
I never said he was alive, I said he was back.

1482
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:30,210
所以他死了?
So he's dead?

1483
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:33,610
他当然死了 他对着自己的脑袋开了枪 没人能在那种情况下活下来
Of course he's dead, he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.

1484
01:26:33,620 --> 01:26:37,130
我刚刚以过量用药为代价证明了这一点
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.

1485
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:39,540
毫无疑问 莫里亚蒂已经死了
Moriarty is dead, no question.

1486
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:44,580
但是更重要的是 我清楚地知道他下一步要做什么
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.

1487
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:56,370
飞行器
Flying machines,

1488
01:26:56,380 --> 01:26:58,690
还有 呃 叫电话的通信装置?
these, er, telephone contraptions?

1489
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,330
这也太疯狂了吧?
What sort of lunatic fantasy is that?

1490
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:03,290
这仅仅是我对未来世界 以及对你和我在那个世界所扮演的角色的
It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like

1491
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:05,770
简单的设想
and how you and I might fit inside it.

1492
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,050
懂逻辑的人能够通过一滴水推断出
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer

1493
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,610
它来自大西洋还是尼亚加拉河
the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.

1494
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:12,130
又或是莱辛巴赫大瀑布?
Or a Reichenbach?

1495
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,780
你写完这个案子了吗?
Have you written up your account of the case?

1496
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,090
- 写完了  - 嗯
- Yes.  - Hmm.

1497
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,050
你会把它写成是我为数不多的失败吧?
Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course?

1498
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:19,660
当然
Of course.

1499
01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:24,890
就叫做...
The Adventure Of...

1500
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:26,220
无形的军队
The Invisible Army.

1501
01:27:28,140 --> 01:27:29,380
复仇女神的联盟?
The League Of Furies?

1502
01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:32,410
魔鬼军团?
The Monstrous Regiment?

1503
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:35,680
我觉得 不如叫做"可恶的新娘"
I rather thought The Abominable Bride.

1504
01:27:36,380 --> 01:27:37,310
有点惊悚的感觉
A trifle lurid.

1505
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:39,440
这样销量才好 毕竟里面也有谋杀的内容
It'll sell. It's got proper murders in it too.

1506
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:40,770
这方面你是专家
You're the expert.

1507
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,850
在现实状态里
As for your own tale,

1508
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:47,570
你服用的真的只是百分之七的溶液吗?
are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take?

1509
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,690
我觉得你可能增加了剂量
I think you may have increased the dosage.

1510
01:27:49,700 --> 01:27:51,900
或许那也是我的幻觉
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.

1511
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,460
不过这种事情也时有发生
But perhaps such things could come to pass.

1512
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,450
在任何时候 我都知道在那样的世界里我也能很自在
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.

1513
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,100
- 哈 我可不这么觉得  - 我很怀疑
- Huh, I don't think I would be. - I beg to differ.

1514
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:06,330
不过我一直明白 我从来都是个与时代格格不入的人
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
