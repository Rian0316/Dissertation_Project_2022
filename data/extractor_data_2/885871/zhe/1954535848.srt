1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,140
就这样在分开六个月之后
And so, after six months apart,

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,870
莉莉阿姨和马修叔叔 终于重修旧好了
Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall were finally back together.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,310
天那
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,810
这些煎饼太好吃了
These pancakes are delicious!

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,130
谢谢
Yes. Thank you.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,170
你不在的这个夏天 我学会了做饭
Um, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,960
那今晚你来做饭吧
Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,180
好啊
Yeah, sure.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,310
煎饼如何
How about pancakes?

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,570
一切恢复了正常 几乎是...
And things were back to normal... almost.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,080
也许你没有太多的灶具 但至少我嫁了个
You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,300
会烧煎饼的男人
who knows how to make pancakes.

13
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:34,291
Oh, um...

14
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,880
我意思是...
I mean, um...

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,410
我知道我们俩还没讨论
Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,650
我们和好是不是意味 我们要结婚
whether us getting back together means us getting married, but...

17
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,850
但我仍然想结
I still wanna.

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,670
你还想结吗?
Do you still wanna?

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,430
真的吗?
Really?

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,420
当然了　我爱你
Of course, I love you.

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,730
等等  你就这么向我求婚?
No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it?

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,870
就句　你还想结婚? 这是我听过的最寒碜的求婚
"Do you still wanna?" That's like the lamest proposal ever.

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,980
当我向你求婚的时候 我单膝跪下　也许我会说
When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.

24
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,380
马修・埃里克森 你愿意...
Marshall Eriksen, will you ma...

25
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,560
- 不行　不行 - 怎么啦
- No, no, no, no, no, no. - What?!

26
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,220
你不能这么开门见山 要循序渐进
You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that.

27
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,920
你要先来个演讲暖场
You got to have, like, a little speech.

28
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,770
你还记得你是怎么向我求婚的
Do you remember your proposal to me?

29
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,780
我确实准备了一篇演讲
I had a speech prepared.

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,790
那你想听什么呢
What do you want to hear?

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,280
我不知道　也许 你可以说
I don't know. I mean, you could tell me,

32
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,070
比如说　你可以讲讲我有多帅 我既幽默又聪明
like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am

33
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,600
我后来有一段时间有健身
and I've been working out lately.

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,900
如果你能提到这个就更好了
It might be nice for you to mention something... about that.

35
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,430
马修...
Marshall...

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,330
- 你太帅了... - 谢谢
- you are good-looking... - Thank you.

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
- 你又幽默 - 谢谢
- You're funny. - Oh, thanks.

38
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,590
- 又聪明 - 你不妨再掉几滴眼泪
- You're smart. - And a few tears wouldn't hurt.

39
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,420
你他妈的就不能跟我结婚吗?
Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?

40
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,640
我当然会和你结婚了
I'll marry you. Of course.

41
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,110
在我把戒指带上以前 别指望我会跟你上床?
But, um, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,070
好的
Yeah, right.

我会给你这个
I'll give you this.

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,600
这是个糖浆的妙用
That was a very creative use of syrup.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,090
我现在甚至不能直视Mrs Butterworth (一种糖浆)
I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye.

51
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,630
天那　我们要结婚了
Oh, my God. We're getting married!

52
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,360
我知道　我知道
I know, I know.

53
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,890
先是一阵幸福
It was a moment of happiness,

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,770
紧接着　却是一阵恐慌
followed of course by a moment of total panic.

55
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,890
知道吗　莉莉阿姨 第一次取消婚礼
See, when they called off their first wedding,

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,200
然后只身去了旧金山
Aunt Lily took off for San Francisco

57
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,570
留下马修叔叔和一大堆烂摊子
leaving Uncle Marshall with the unfortunate task

58
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,340
他得去跟他的整个家族解释
of telling his entire family.

59
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,320
是　她走了 婚礼也取消了
Yeah, so now she's gone and the wedding's off.

60
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,710
这种自己一走了之  不管后果 的人你们管他叫什么?
What do you call someone who just takes off and leaves like that?

61
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,200
你管她叫什么
What do you call that?

62
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,910
这会不会有点过啦
I think that that's a little strong.

63
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,060
我真不敢相信你会用这个词
I can't even believe you would use a word like that.

64
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,980
天那　奶奶
Geez, Grandma.

65
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,390
我取消婚礼把事情搞得一团糟 对吧
Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?

66
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,350
不要紧　宝贝
It's okay, baby.

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,610
不过你不是 现在才意识到吧?
You're not just realizing that now, are you?

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,740
一想到要站在一群
God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people

69
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,640
讨厌我的人前面...
who hate my guts...

70
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,910
就让我有马上跑到 大西洋城结婚的冲动
just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.

71
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,430
对啊
Yeah.

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,880
11点新闻 东河里还有食人鱼?
Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River?

73
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,730
无知能让你被吃掉
What you don't know... could eat you.

74
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,990
罗宾　停一下
Robin! Stop the news!

75
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,120
- 怎么啦? - 没事　他们是我的朋友
- What the hell? - It's okay. They're my friends.

76
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,980
我们要去大西洋城结婚 你跟我们一起去吧
We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.

77
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,970
天那　太棒了
Oh, my God, that is so fantastic!

78
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,870
我不知道我现在能不能走
I-I don't know if I can just leave work.

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,500
好了　今晚就让 迈克来播新闻好了
It's  okay; Mike can read the news tonight.

80
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,600
迈克　你识字吧?
Hey, Mike... you can read, right?

81
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,010
我朗读最在行了
Yeah, I'm the best at reading.

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,170
- 让我们一起大西洋城吧 - 走
- Let's go to Atlantic City! - Yeah!

83
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,340
你们俩要私奔　这太棒了
You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic.

84
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,110
你这样作是不是因为 罗嗦的泰德叔叔总有一天会知道?
Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,020
我不希望... 因为我们要喝醉了去结婚
I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.

86
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,340
哥们　这听起很有意思 但我手头工作放不下...
Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work.

87
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,070
我现在有点重要 我是项目经理
I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.

88
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,080
泰德　在以后
Ted, for the rest of our lives,

89
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,270
我们都会一直传说着
we are going to be telling the amazing story

90
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,950
我们怎么去大西洋城结婚的故事
of how we went to Atlantic City and got married.

91
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,470
你不想出现在这个故事里吗
Don't you want to be in that story?

92
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,960
我当然想了
Of course I do.

93
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,770
- 让我们一起去吧 - 好的
- Let's go to Atlantic City! - Yeah!

94
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,060
但是以后说起这个故事的时候 能不能把我刚才犹豫这部分省略掉
Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?

95
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,550
没问题
You got it.

96
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,380
嘿　哥们
Hey, guys.

97
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,110
哇　足浴啊
Wow. A pedicure.

98
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,940
如果一个男人 去足浴有什么不妥的话
Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure

99
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,120
我觉得也不至于 成为男性杂志上的特写
I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.

100
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,870
我们现在要去大西洋城结婚
We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!

101
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,280
莉莉　恭喜你
Oh, congratulations, Lily.

102
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,240
马修　你要结婚? 你有什么毛病啊?
Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?

103
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,210
去还是不去?
So are you in or not?

104
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,660
开玩笑 我当然要去
Hell, yeah, I'm in!

105
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,190
但　等等　我快好了
Just... I'm almost done.

106
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,010
- 没关系　我们也来... - 实际上　我意思是...
- No, we got to get going to the... - Well, actually, I mean...

107
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,160
今天是我结婚的日子 既然我们在这了
It is my wedding day, and since we're here...

108
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,730
那我们也先做个足浴 然后才去了
So we all got a pedicure and then headed down...

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,040
大西洋城
to Atlantic City.

110
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,770
看这地方
Wow. Look at this place.

111
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,040
我想我会挑些旧的
I guess I'll have my pick of something old.

112
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,420
还有蓝色的... 真该有人过来给检查一下这位女士
And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.

113
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,740
大西洋城的生意一直在衰退
Ah, A.C., always in decline,

114
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,420
但绝不会崩溃
never hitting bottom.

115
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,680
老朋友 我又回来了
It's good to be back, old friend.

116
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,130
你以前来过这?
You been here before?

117
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,790
恩　一两次
Oh, uh, once or twice.

118
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,130

Three times, maybe.

121
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,020
婚礼小教堂就在那
The wedding chapel-- this is it.

122
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,840
你准备好了吗
Are you ready to do this?

123
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,240
好了
I'm ready.

124
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,480
- 我们去结婚吧 - 好
- Let's get married. - Yeah.

125
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,920
糟了　我没面纱
Oh, crap. I don't have a veil.

126
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,860
我是个新娘 我不能没面纱就结婚
I'm a bride; I can't get married without a veil.

127
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,770
还有花束 我需要面纱和花束
And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet.

128
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,310
我们马上要结婚了
Oh, my God, we're getting married.

129
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,600
不要担心　放松 我马上给你找面纱
Don't  worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.

130
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,960
罗宾　你这件礼服真漂亮
Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.

131
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,210
真的? 谢谢
Oh, really? Thanks.

132
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,050
是的　但你不能穿 我是新娘　你不能比我漂亮
Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride; you can't look better than me.

133
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,300
好
Done.

134
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,290
我们去找花束 你们男人去找面纱
I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil.

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,360

We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes.

136
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:23,940
走　分头行动
Ready, break.

137
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,810
你们想要赌一把吗
You  guys want to go gamble?

138
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,260
不　我们要去找面纱
No, we got to go get the veil.

139
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,510
或者我们说　我们找遍了 但找不到
Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.

140
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,890
好主意
Yeah, okay.

141
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,920
你们去赌吧 我去找面纱
No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil.

142
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,350
你就这样过? 这可是你最后20分钟的单身生活了
So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life.

- How are you feeling? - Great, a little nervous.

145
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,010
- 是吗? 想便便? - 不是那种紧张
- Yeah? Craps? - Not that nervous.

146
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,500
- 不是　我意思是你想玩骰子吗 - 当然了
- No, I mean do you want to play craps. - Oh, yeah, definitely.

147
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,140
好　我找到面纱了
Okay, I got the veil.

148
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,600
她还没做好准备要结婚
She wasn't ready to be married.

149
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,170
现在我们讨论下单身派对
All right, let's talk bachelor party.

150
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,330
你们是想要看全套脱衣舞? 还是我们开个房间
Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,110
开个私家"用具"展览会
and have a private toy show-- whew.

152
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,560
你刚才说什么来着?
What did you just say?

153
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,560
- 巴尼　不行 - 马修　我是你的伴郎
- Barney, no. - Marshall, I'm your best man.

154
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,250
- 你不是我的伴郎 - 我才是
- You're not my best man. - Right here.

155
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,140
作为伴郎 我要 给你开个单身派对
And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party.

156
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,740
这就是好朋友要做的事
That's part of being a best friend.

157
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,810
- 你不是我最好的朋友 - 我才是
- You're not my best friend. - Right here.

158
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,120
巴尼　我没时间开单身派对
Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party.

159
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,410
我只有大概18分钟
I've got, like, 18 minutes.

160
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:17,080
18分钟
18 minutes.

161
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,060
你找到面纱了吗
Oh, good. Did you get the veil?

162
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,190
当然了
Of course.

163
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,330
正好花了我们18分钟
And it took us exactly 18 minutes.

164
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,480
我们去了脱衣舞俱乐部
We went to a strip club.

165
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,010
- 哥们 - 难以置信
- Dude! - Unbelievable!

166
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,720
我们在那时间很短 这并不是说我没有时间
We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time

167
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,780
让人坐我大腿上跳舞 有人已经在我腿上跳过了
to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.

168
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,250
- 这是你最后一次跳这样的舞了 - 对...
- Your last lap dance ever. - Right...

169
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,230
什么?
What?

170
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,330
好　我来了
Okay, I'm here. Right?

171
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,400
人们来大西洋城烧钱 不就是为这个
Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.

172
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,140
我好像闻到 脱衣舞娘的味道了
Does it smell like strippers in here?

173
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,510
有点怪　对吧
That's weird, right?

174
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,750
马修和莉莉要结婚了
Marshall and Lily are getting married!

175
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,870
对　看这个东西
Hell, yeah, look at this.

176
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,420
宝贝　就是这个
Oh, baby, this is it.

177
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,640
- 让我们开始吧 - 好的
- Let's do this thing. - All right.

178
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,700
我们是来这结婚的
Hi. We're here to get married.

179
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,900
恭喜你 我们提供各种服务
Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages

180
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,410
让你实现你梦想中 这个特殊时刻
to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.

181
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,480
我们不需要这些 一个最简单快捷的婚礼就可以了
We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.

182
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,770
对
Yeah.

183
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,870
你知道吗 这里不是拉斯维加斯
You know this isn't Vegas, right?

184
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,700
那当然　在拉斯维加斯 空气里都弥漫着赌场的味道
Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen.

185
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,000
这里大家除了自己 什么都没带
Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.

186
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,170
什么?
What?

187
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,790
在新泽西办个 结婚证最快要三天
It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey.

188
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,850
你们能登记到的 最早也要星期一
The earliest I could book you for is Monday.

189
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,310
不行　不行 必须是今天　这才有意思
No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.

190
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,780
我不知道该怎么说好
Look, I don't know what to say,

191
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:39,400
但如果你们不定星期一
but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday

192
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,290
或者不玩把基诺 我就没法帮你
or play a round of keno, I can't help you.

193
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,130
三十五号
Thirty-five.

194
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,000
等等　我搞不懂 人们随时都可以在大西洋城结婚的
Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.

195
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,190
是的　但他们不是私奔
Yes, they do, but they don't elope.

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,140
他们选择大西洋城 因为这里有白色的沙滩
They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches,

197
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,510
世界级的高档度假设施 和有异国情调的海滨
world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.

198
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,090
你去过外面吗?
Have you been outside?

199
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,650
离遮阳伞不到20英尺的地方 有只腐烂了一半的虎鲸
There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.

200
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,140
哥们　放松点
You guys, take it easy, guys.

201
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,530
你确定?
Are you sure about this?

202
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,400
这个小礼堂所在州的婚姻法?
About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel?

203
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,250
是的　我很确定
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

204
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,770
往好处想 单身派对可以继续了
Bright side: the bachelor party continues!

205
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,630
对
Yes!

206
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,290
继续吗?你是说"开始" 他是说"开始"
Continues? You mean "start." He means "start."

207
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,140
我们去过脱衣舞俱乐部了
We went to a strip club.

208
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,740
二十七号
Twenty-seven.

209
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,320
有没有别的方法 让我们今天拿到结婚证
Is there any way that we could get a license today?

210
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,910
你可以去法院
You could go to the courthouse.

211
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,700
在特殊情况下 等待时间可以取消
In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived,

212
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,580
但你必须有足够的理由
but you have to have a good reason.

213
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,950
我们深爱对方
Well, we're in love.

214
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,850
还有比这更好的理由吗
What better reason could there be?

215
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,940
我最近听到的一个是
The last one I heard was,

216
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,800
我明天就要去伊拉克 保卫我们的国家
"I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country,"

217
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,870
但是你可以去试试
but, you know, give yours a whirl.

218
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,620
于是我们去了法庭...
So we went to the courthouse.

219
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,960
我觉得要等到天荒地老一样
God, this is taking forever.

220
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,540
我不敢相信他们要结婚了
Can't believe they're getting married.

221
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,450
我知道
I know.

222
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,360
我为他们感到骄傲 他们在一起经历了这么多
I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through.

223
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,300
事实上 那条疯狂之路
In fact, that crazy road has led them

224
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,750
直接把他们带到了大西洋城
all the way here to Atlantic City.

225
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,350
泰德　抬头
Ted, up here.

226
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,740
你一直盯着我衣服上的胸部看
You were just staring at my shirt boobs.

227
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,240
我没有
No! I wasn't.

228
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,510
我...是在看这件 衣服下面的美女
I-I was checking out the hot bod underneath the shirt.

229
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,790
好了　也许 我是在看你的衣服
Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt,

230
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,890
但...这衣服很有意思
but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.

231
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,030
嘿　是巴尼!
Hey, it's Barney!

232
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,910
- 巴尼 - 你好
- Barney! - Hi.

233
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,030
...穿上西装
...suit up.

234
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,810
...传
...legend.

235
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,760
...奇
...Daddy.

236
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,450
传奇
American daddy.

237
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,560
这怎么回事吗
What the hell was that?

238
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,120
一个... 中国人
A... Chinese guy?

239
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,990
你好　我们要办个结婚证
Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license,

240
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,980
但我们想跳过等待期
but we need to skip the waiting period because...

241
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,130
我们深爱着对方
we're in love.

242
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,000
我将帮你们取消等待期
Aw. I'm gonna waive this waiting period right now.

243
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,070
真的?!
Oh, really?!

244
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,380
要是我能这么作 我肯定会
Is what I would say if I could waive the waiting period,

245
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,460
但遗憾的是只有法官才能
but unfortunately, only a judge can do that.

246
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,150
那我们能见法官吗
Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?

247
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,080
- 当然了 - 真的?!
- Absolutely. - Really?!

248
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,110
假如你们今天有机会可以见到的话 我当然会让你们见
Is what I would say if there was any chance of you seeing a judge today,

249
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,450
不过今天没机会
which there isn't.

250
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,610
你为什么老是耍我?!
Why are you doing this to us?!

251
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:35,040
因为正在拍录像!
'Cause you're on Candid Camera!

252
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,930
- 真的?! - 要是...
- Really?! - Is what I would say...

253
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,750
你知道吗? 我们知道了
You know what? We get it.

254
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,170
好　这是第二套方案
Okay, this is a good plan B.

255
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,360
法官是人 是人就要去厕所
Judges are people. People go to the batoom.

256
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,420
法官就必定要经过这里
A judge is bound to come by eventually,

257
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,780
然后我们就可以结婚了
and we'll get married.

258
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,020
我肯定我们不用等多久
I'm sure we won't be waiting long.

259
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,880
天那　我们就去 自动售货机才30秒钟
Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.

260
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,200
一帮老家伙
Vultures.

261
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,760
什么?
What?

262
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,460
这里?
Here?

263
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,900
我们可以打发打发时间
Yeah. Got a little time to kill.

264
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,760
天哪　都是因为 这件衣服　对吧?
Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?

265
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,840
不是
No.

266
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,150
有点
A little.

267
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,710
今天你实在不对劲
Something is seriously wrong with you.

268
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,780
那是同不同意?
So what, is that a no?

269
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,620
- 行　我们干吧 - 好的
- All right, let's do it. - All right.

270
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,440
恩　那这个?
Um, also...?

271
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,340
- 是的　我不脱 - 太好了
- Yes, I'll leave it on. - Sweet.

272
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,260
哥们　我们放弃吧 这不可能发生了
Guys, let's bail. This is never gonna happen.

273
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,340
我知道现在事情有点糟糕
Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster,

274
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,560
但是　相信 这比那个烂摊子要好
but believe me, it's better than the alternative.

275
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,620
你给你大学里 所有疯狂的单身朋友
You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food

276
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,190
开了个派对　那么多酒 东西都免费吃
and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college?

277
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,120
是的　很高兴 结果不是最糟的
Yeah,  glad we dodged that bullet.

278
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,580
法官 法官 快来　快来
Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!

279
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,900
- 关了它 - 好的
- Turn it off. - Okay.

280
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,330
我们可以今天结婚吗?
May we please get married today?

281
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,390
一般来说我会说不可以
Now, normally I would say no to a request like that,

282
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,500
但是你们两个让我印象深刻
but you two impress me.

283
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,640
你们两个在一起 同甘共苦过了十年
Just the fact that you've been together for ten years,

284
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,220
站在彼此的身边不离不弃
standing by each other's side through thick and thin,

285
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,530
从没动摇
never wavering.

286
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,960
- 那是什么? - 什么吗?
- What was that? - What was what?

287
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,950
你们的表情!是怎么回事?
That little look. What was that?

288
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,700
爱的表情
A look of love.

289
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,820
你们两个人一起同甘共苦?
You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?

290
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,510
- 你知道　什么胖　什么瘦? - 是　我意思　我都经历过
- You know, what's thick, what's thin? - Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.

291
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,700
我有...
I have.

292
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,160
那个表情到底是怎么回事?
All  right, what was that look?

293
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,540
怎么啦?
What's going on?

294
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,310
他们在夏天的时候曾经分手过
They broke up over the summer.

295
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,970
莉莉跑到了旧金山 这两个人刚刚在柜子里做爱
Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet.

296
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,230
什么? 在这 我们要宣誓诚实
What? We're under oath.

297
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,620
我们没有
No, we're not.

298
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,270
我们有必要诚实 他是个法官
Yeah, we are. He's a judge.

299
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,890
我们为什么要宣誓?
Wh-- did we take an oath?

300
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,850
你知道什么是宣誓
Do you even know what an oath is?

301
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,940
知道　法院
Uh, yeah. Courthouse.

302
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,130
宣誓　我们就在这下面
Oath. We're under it.

303
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,850
哥们　看来今天是不行了
Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.

304
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,410
不　马修　今天一定要结婚
No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.

305
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,580
宝贝　无论去哪我们 都要拿到结婚证
Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.

306
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,210
除了国际公共水域
Except international waters.

307
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,580
所以　我们去找个船长
So-so let's find a ship captain.

308
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,360
船长能让我们结婚
A ship captain can marry us.

309
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,490
这地方船很多
There's boats all over this place.

310
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,380
那些垃圾堆里 不是浮着些木船吗
Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?

311
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,560
好主意　这能行 我们走吧
This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.

312
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,190
打扰了 你是船长吗
Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?

313
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,320
这是我的游戏机
This is my machine.

314
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,750
- 我去跟她谈谈 - 不　让我去
-  I should go talk to her. - No, let me.

315
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,110
- 我们去赌一把? - 好的
- Blackjack? - Yeah.

316
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,600
我找到了一个人 他说可以用他的船带我们出去
Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip,

317
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,450
所以我们又接近了点
so we're getting closer.

318
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,530
好　莉莉 今天结婚就那么重要吗
Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?

319
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,680
因为　如果我们 今天不结婚的话
Because... if we don't do it today,

320
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,420
以后就要举办一个盛大的婚礼
I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding

321
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,990
然后就会有一大群中西部来的人
with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,140
一边喝着蛋黄酱
looking all disapproving and judging me

323
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,110
一边不屑的谈论我
while sipping little cups of mayonnaise

324
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,050
还有整晚都会 开我以前逃跑的玩笑
and-and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.

325
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,750
- 没人会这样 - 是的　他们不会
- Nobody's gonna do that. - No, they're not

326
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,450
因为我不会 给他们这样的机会
because I'm not gonna give them the chance.

327
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,490
我要去找个船长　然后今晚就结婚
I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.

328
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,180
宝贝　这太疯狂了
Sweetie, this is crazy.

329
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,490
你不可能找到船长的
You're never gonna find a ship capt...

330
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,720
莉莉　我们找到一个船长了
Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.

331
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,230
- 什么 - 真的
- What? - Yeah.

332
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,640
第一个跟我们说话的人就是个船长
First guy we talked to. Ship captain.

333
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,110
要多巧有多巧
How great is that?

334
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,990
看到了吗?这就是命运
See? See, this is destiny.

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,790
船长　你能带我们到国际公共水域 并给我们证婚吗?
So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?

336
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,830
当然可以
I sure can.

337
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,520
如果要说两件我最喜欢做的事 就是给人们证婚
If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage

338
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,770
- 和挣5000美元 - 什么
- and making $5,000. - What?

339
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,140
5000美元　成交 我们接受了　各位 来吧
Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody.

340
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,050
把你们的现金交拿出来 不要犹豫　行动吧
Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.

341
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,520
我能帮你们弄到钱
I can get us that money.

342
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,640
怎么弄?
How?

343
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,350
今天你们有没有注意到
Have you noticed that all day today

344
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,270
那些中国人过来跟我打招呼
Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?

345
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,580
你有没有注意到 我没问你为什么
Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it

346
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,590
因为我怕听到答案
because I'm too scared of the answer?

347
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,020
其实他们是我的赌友
Well, those are my old gambling buddies.

348
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,610
事实上　我曾经 一天到晚都在这呆着
Truth is... I used to come here all the time.

349
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,460
玩一个古老的中国玩法 "行还是不行"
Play an old Chinese game called "Shing Hasabu Shing".

350
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,560
然后出了点小问题
Had a small gambling problem.

351
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,590
事实上也不怎么小
Actually, it wasn't so small. I...

352
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,740
我输掉了我所有的积蓄
kind of lost my entire life's savings.

353
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,390
但今晚我觉得我运气很好
But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot.

354
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,790
我想我能赢钱
I think I can win us that money.

355
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:32,740
不行　我不能 让你拿我们的钱赌
No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.

356
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,800
如果你知道自己会赢 这就称不上赌了
Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win.

357
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,850
我能赢到那笔
I'll get us that money.

358
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,880
我发誓...
I swear it, nay...

359
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,100
我宣誓
I oath it.

360
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,580
在那一晚之前我去很多赌场
Now, I had been to a lot of casinos before that night,

361
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,010
之后我也去过很多赌场
and I've been to a lot of casinos since,

362
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,720
但我从来没 见过象这样的赌法
but in all that time I've never seen a game quite like this one.

363
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,330
到现在  我都 不明白怎么玩的
To this day, I have no idea how it was played.

364
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,410
但幸运的是　巴尼懂
But luckily, Barney did.

365
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,350
你知道这怎么玩吗?
Do you understand what's happening?

366
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,130
毫无头绪.
Not a clue.

367
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,640
你觉得他是在赢吗
Do you think he's winning?

368
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,660
我根本不知道他是不是开始赌了
I don't even know if he's playing.

369
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,130
等等　我知道了 我知道怎么玩了
Wait, I get it. I understand this game.

370
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,870
你不知道
No, you don't.

371
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,190
西奥多 我完全知道怎么玩了
I totally understand the game, Theodore.

372
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,610
巴尼　把你的筹码都押上
Barney, split your tiles.

373
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,610
如果你能找到那个软心豆粒糖 就能赢三倍的钱
You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.

374
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,800
马修　别吵... 你以为我不知道自己在干什么吗...
Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm...

375
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,230
天那　对啊
My God, you're right.

376
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,010
天那　太美了
Wow. It's beautiful.

377
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,430
谢谢　巴尼
Thanks, Barney.

378
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,080
你们看到了吗? 我今天手气太好了
Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight.

379
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,520
我现在迫不及待想回去
Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore.

380
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,320
上帝　我爱赌博!
God, I love gambling!

381
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,260
回家以后我们得开个小会了
When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?

382
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,370
为什么我就不能再玩一会?
Why can't I do it just a little?

383
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,790
好
Okay.

384
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,630
让我们开始吧
Let's get this started.

385
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,070
好...
Okay, uh...

386
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,800
你们想要严肃的 还是很有趣的?
you guys want the serious one or the funny one?

387
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,030
我想严肃的最好
Oh, I think... serious would be best.

388
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,850
你确定?那你就 听不到很多笑话了
You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there.

389
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,060
比如说你们如何浮起对方的船
Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.

390
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:06,140
还是严肃的好
Yeah, serious is probably good.

391
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,240
我们今天在这里
"We stand witness today

392
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,890
来庆祝莉莉和马修的结合
"to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall.

393
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,600
今天他们两人将合二为一
"Today, you two will become one,

394
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,660
共同分担生活中

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,080
这太棒了
This is pretty cool.

398
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,510
我不相信 你说绝不结婚
I can't believe you never want to get married.

399
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,700
我从没说"绝不"
I never said "never."

400
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,710
...来见证你们对彼此
"...to declare your love

401
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,440
爱和投入
"and devotion to each other

402
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,750
在你们家人和朋友
"in front of friends and family,

403
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,840
以及所以对你们来说 重要的人前面
"all the people who matter most to you."

404
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,560
怎么啦?
What was that?

405
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,400
什么怎么啦?
What was what?

406
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,240
那个表情 你们刚才 看了对方一眼
That little look. You two just shared a look.

407
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,040
- 我们不想结婚了 - 我们不结了
- We don't want to do this. - We don't.

408
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,130
你们开什么玩笑?
Are you kidding me?

409
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,510
你们第二次取消婚礼?
You guys are calling off another wedding?

410
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,150
在我花了所有钱 买了件伴娘的衣服之后?
After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?

411
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,350
我是不是跟谁赌他们会取消婚礼? 是吧? 我是跟谁赌的
Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?

412
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,620
你们还指望我们中有哪个人 会去参加你们第三次婚礼?
You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?

413
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:13,910
当然了
Yes.

414
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,430
那一些会很棒
'Cause it's gonna be amazing.

415
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,280
以前我害怕面对马修的家人
Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family

416
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,250
而且我讨厌那些程序...
and-and I didn't want to do all that work, but...

417
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,210
现在我们到了这里
now that we're here...

418
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,410
我发现我必须要面对他的家人
I realize that I have to face Marshall's family

419
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,730
我发现我必须面对那些结婚的程序
and I really want to do all that work.

420
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,110
我也是
So do I.

421
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,030
虽然...我的家人 可能仍然生你的气
And yeah... my family might still be upset with you.

422
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,010
但他们看到我们在一起 他们将会知道到我们彼此有多相爱
But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other.

423
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,140
没有什么事情会影响我们
And none of that other stuffs are gonna matter

424
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,640
我爱你 马修
I love you , Marshall

425
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,810
我也爱你 小百合
I love you too,Lily-pad

426
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,640
我现在宣布 你们成为丈夫和妻子
I now pronounce you man and wife.

427
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,110
- 什么?! - 什么?!
-What ?! -What ?!

428
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,110
怎么 我说错了吗?
Was that not right ?

429
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,810
我们结婚了?
Are...we married..?

430
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,510
你刚才宣布我们成婚了? 我们刚才讲那么多你都没听啊?
Did you just marry us..why don't you listening..

431
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,740
我们不想结婚了
We don't want to be married

432
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,870
我以为
Uh....I..surpose

433
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,710
我可以宣布婚姻无效
I could unpronounce you

434
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,270
-快点宣布无效 -快点宣布无效
-Unpronounce us -Unpronounce us

435
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,710
好的  我现在宣布婚姻无效
Okay, I unpronounce you man and wife

436
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,370
事情结束了
