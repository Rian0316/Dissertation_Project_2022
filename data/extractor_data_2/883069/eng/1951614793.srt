1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Previously on.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,490
the new neighbor...

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,110
- he's cute.
- He's a bachelor.

4
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:06,790
Became a hero.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,270
In a crisis that brought julie and austin together,

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,740
while carlos and gaby broke apart.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,990
I had a career and a future,
but I gave it all up for you,

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:18,970
and what did I get in return?

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,080
The police assembled their pieces of evidence.

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,100
Your phone number was written on her hand.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,470
I can't help you.

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,120
No memory,huh?
That's convenient.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,710
karen mccluskey had always believed
in helping others,

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,900
whether they wanted her help or not.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,040
What's all this?

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,750
You know how you never got around
to painting your garage door?

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,620
Well,it's done.

18
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,890
Hope you like blue.

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,990
Baxter!
You found him!

20
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,650
Yeah,and I got him neutered,too.

21
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,310
I figured you wouldn't want any more
strays around here.

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,020
- Karen!
- Hi,alberta.

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,170
I took these down for you since,you know,
christmas was six months ago.

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,750
Yes,mrs.Mccluskey's
helping hand was known throughout wisteria lane.

25
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,480
But on this day,it was about to get slapped.

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,680
What the hell are you doing?

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,320
jeez,edie,you scared me.

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,700
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,460
Getting mike's house ready.
He comes back from the hospital tomorrow.

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,600
Since when do you have a key to his garage?

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:30,820
He gave me one...
in case of an emergency.

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,680
Don't lie to me,prune.

33
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,120
Fine,I found it under his mat.
Look,I'm not doing anything wrong.

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,150
I just come over once a week and start his mower
so the engine doesn't get rusty.

35
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,410
And do you mow your lawn with it,too?

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,580
What's the big deal?
I'm doing him a favor.

37
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,920
Well,he doesn't need any favors from you.

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,210
I'm gonna go through mike's house room by room,

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,810
and if I find as much as one paper clip missing,
I'm calling the cops.

40
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,550
Funny you should talk about stuff that's missing.

41
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,640
I found those pictures of mike
and susan you threw out.

42
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,590
Pictures?

43
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,730
Oh,don't act for me.

44
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,340
I know that mike's been having
troubles with his memory.

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,880
My guess--

46
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,380
you don't want him to remember how crazy
he was about his old girlfriend.

47
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,720
I don't need to resort to deception to land a man.

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,200
Oh,edie,I saved the pictures...

49
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,870
and I can sh them to mike anytime I like.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,870
Yes,karen mccluskey believed in helping others...

51
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,790
where are you going with this?

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,280
Which she felt gave her the right...

53
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,410
to help herself.

So remember to be polite...

58
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,940
each year as part of their fund-raising drive,

59
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,810
the fairview adventure scouts
would award a shiny new bike

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,920
to whoever sold the most magazine subscriptions,

61
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,360
and each scout would set out utterly
convinced the prize would be hers.

62
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,020
That's the beauty of youth.

63
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,000
Young girls believe anything is possible...

64
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,670
that is,until they grow up anget divorced.

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,260
Hi.

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,300
What if I told you there is a way
you could help cldren while

67
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,580
also reading your favorite magazines
at a reduced price?

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,610
Would you like to hear more?

69
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,720
Sure,knock yourself out.

70
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,300
Wise choice.

71
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,450
For the lady of the house,we offer.

72
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,490
"Redbook," "glamour," "vog-you"...

73
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,590
I think you mean "vogue," sweetie.

74
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,410
You sure?

75
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,740
I should know.
I was on the cover.

76
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,560
No way.

77
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,260
Uh,way.

78
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,040
oh,see that coat I'm wearing in this shot?
That's genuine ocelot fur.

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,650
Although the photographer was the real animal,
if you know what I'm saying...

80
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,940
which I hope you don'T.

81
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,040
And don't ever do drugs,okay?

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,770
Being a model must be so amazing.

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,730
Why did you stop?

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,510
Well,I fell in love,

85
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,840
got married and moved to the suburbs for
the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing.

86
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,270
That was a crock.

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,930
So you going back to modeling?

88
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,870
No.
No,no,no,no,no,no.

89
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:00,910
Why not?

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,030
What else are you gonna do?

91
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,650
You're going back to modeling?
This is so sudden.

92
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,280
Well,let's not get ahead of ourselves.

93
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,770
I'm just gonna fly to new york,meet with
my old agent and take it from there.

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,880
Come on,you guys,this is exciting.
Be happy for me.

95
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,200
Oh,we are.
We're just gonna miss you,that's all.

96
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,010
Well,now that my divorce is final,
I need a reason to wake up in the morning.

97
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,140
I have this hole in my life that
can't be filled by shopping.

98
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,430
That's right,I said it.

99
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,220
Oh,my gosh.
Lynette.

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,560
I'll get the kids.
They're dying to see you.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,040
- okay.
- HeY.

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,450
Hey!
Oh,my gosh!

103
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,120
You didn't have to do this!

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,020
- hello!
- hi!

105
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,260
You look great.

106
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,590
Well,apparently,taking a .38
slug to the shoulder agrees with you.

107
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,700
Yeah,um,listen,about that...
the kids don't know what happened.

108
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,490
They don't?

109
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,900
I thought they were little young to deal
with their mother getting shot.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,660
All I told them is kayla is
staying with her grandmother,

111
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,580
and I madep a story about how I got hurt.

112
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,530
- hey,mom!
- oh,here they are!

113
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,420
- Hey!
- mommy!

114
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,460
Oh,this side.
Hi!

115
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,580
Hello!

116
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,150
I can't believe you got in a fight with a hobo.

117
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,150
Yeah...

118
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,320
well,let's see how well you do
on a morphine drip.

119
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,730
Mommy,come inside.We helped mrs.Mccluskey
make your favorite lunch.

120
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,290
Fantastic!
Lead the wa I'm coming in.

121
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,560
Hurry up.I'm hungry.
let's go.

122
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,910
There she is!
Hi,my little bunny!

123
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,110
Hey,why don't you go inside
and get the party started?

124
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,670
I've gotta--
okay?

125
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,750
- Gotcha.
- Hi,bunny.I'll be right there.

126
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,050
Hey.

127
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,060
- Hey,lynette!
- Uh,yeah.

128
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,650
- You're home.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,050
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

130
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,060
I just...

131
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,470
how do I...

132
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,640
thank the man who saved my life?

133
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,550
Oh,no,no,no.
You don't have to say anything.

134
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,430
I'm gonna make you a cake.

135
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,010
- a cake?
- Yeah.

136
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,390
I ver make cakes.
This is huge.

137
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,490
In that case...

138
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,320
thanks.

139
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,210
yeah,I'm gonna make you a cake.

140
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,980
christmas carols?
It's not even thanksgiving.

141
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,220
I'm starting my cards early this year.

142
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,560
It puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,300
And with the pack of lies in this
family newsletter,she spreads holiday denial.

144
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,810
Andrew,it's etiquette.
Nobody wants to read the truth at christmas.

145
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,940
Well said,darling.

146
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,800
honey,would you put on another cd?
Something with sleigh bells.

147
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,350
Oh,by the way,orson,I need,uh,
your mother's address at the nursing home.

148
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,430
Oh,well,I appreciate the thought,darling,
but you needn't send her a card.

149
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,480
Ohdon't be silly.
I'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.

150
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,110
I can certainly send one to your mother.

151
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,010
She's completely senile.
She'll only try to dunk it in her coffee.

152
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,050
Well,all the more reason to send her one.

153
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,340
Let the nurses know that she has family
at home who loves her

154
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,940
and who could drop by at any minute
and slap them with a lawsuit.

155
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,690
Bree,I hear what you're saying--

156
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,620
orson,what's the big deal?
It's just an address.

157
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,610
Fine.
I'll get my book.

158
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,250
The home is somewhere over in lakeview.

159
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,930
Lakeview?Oh,you gave me the impression
that she was back east.

160
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,680
Well,that's because,frankly,
I wanted to avoid this conversation.

161
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,860
But if she's only 30 minutes away,
why haven't you been visiting her?

162
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,200
Okay,the truth is...

163
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,380
it--
it breaks my heart to see her now.

164
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,690
I want to remember her as she was.

165
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,430
- But,orson--
- bree,

166
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,110
I refuse to sit in a room that smells of
disinfectant and lime jell-o,

167
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,700
making small talk with a woman
who doesn't remember me.

168
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,930
Now let it go,damn it.

169
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,580
but by all means,do send a card.

170
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,560
The elves will tickle her.

171
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,330
- Well,shall we?
- Wait.

172
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,780
Julie's gonna know we came home early
from the restaurant to check up on her.

173
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,220
I don't want her to think
I'm overprotective and clingy.

174
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,530
The girl was held hostage.It's only natural
you're gonna be a little bit clingy.

175
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,170
Yeah,it's been a week.
I'm getting on her nerves.

176
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,030
How about this?
We came home early because we hated the restaurant.

177
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,830
The service was dreadful,
and the lobster was inedible.

178
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,740
Okay.

179
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,880
wait,if we hated the restaurant,
then why are we bringing home food?

180
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,220
Good point.

181
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,120
Wait,wait,wait,wait!
Are you kidding?!

182
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,980
That's lobster!

183
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,760
Okay,i thought the restaurant was fantastic,

184
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,160
and you were the fussy snob who
was impossible to please.

185
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Why do I have to be the fussy snob?

186
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,800
Because you're british.

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,470
Fine,but I trust you'll make
it up to me later by

188
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,200
doing the things a gentleman expects
when he's sprung for lobster.

189
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,350
I'm not getting any tonight,am I?

190
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,600
you're supposed to be having dinner!

191
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,120
It's my fault.
I found the restaurant to be absolutely--

192
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,340
oh,let it go.We came home because I was
worried about u,and with good reason.

193
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,010
You,put on your shirt and get out.

194
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,420
Well,I-I didn't bring a shirt.

195
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,080
- See,I was out running and--
- who cares?!Go!

196
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,950
how could you treat him like that?

197
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,440
If austin hadn't been in that supermarket,
I might not be here.

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,500
Yes,and I am grateful,but I found a way to say
"thk you" without taking my top off.

199
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,390
A couple of buttons came undone.
It's not like my boobs were out.

200
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,480
Okay,well,it's,uh,it's getting late and--
and I really--

201
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,010
no,ian,am I overreacting here?

202
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,380
Well,I can understand on the heels of a crisis,
two people might bondand find themselves...

203
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,440
you're a very naughty girl!

204
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,250
Julie,that boy drinks,he steals,

205
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,760
and now I find him mauling you on my couch?
That's it.

206
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,050
I forbid you to see him.

207
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,030
You can't do that.
I choose who I date.

208
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,040
Yeah?Well,I choose to ground you.
Two weeks,baby.

209
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,470
Fine,I'll just see him at school.

210
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,560
Well,then you won't go to school.
I'll homeschool you.

211
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,880
Right,you're gonna teach me trig?
You can't even balance your own checkbook.

212
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,540
Yes,and you will be poorly educated,
and you won't get into college,

213
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,220
and you will work for minimum wage for the
rest of your life,all because of that boy!

214
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,240
I hope you're happy!

215
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,650
Mom,I like this guy,and I'm sorry
if it makes you unhappy,

216
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,960
but I'm going to keep seeing him.

217
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,280
Doesn't the place look great?

218
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,830
I came in and straightened up.
I wanted everything to look nice for you.

219
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,500
You okay?

220
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,520
Yeah.
Yeah,it's just that...

221
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,890
I'm home,but it doesn't really feel like home.

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,080
It will.
Give it time.

223
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,480
The important thing is that you're
back from the hospital,

224
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,370
and every day you're getting better.

225
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,560
Hey,the worst is behind you.

226
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,900
I need the delfino search warrant.

227
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,920
We're not gonna get it without proble cause.

228
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,180
The guy's phone number was written
on a dead girl's hand.

229
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,210
The judge is gonna need more.

230
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,290
I thought you might say that.
Here's monique polier's lab work.

231
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,870
The infrared spectroscopy matched
paint fragnts

232
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,940
in the head wound to the proximo
line of pipe wrenches.

233
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,180
They're high-end,only used by professional plumbers,

234
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,110
and guess what our boy delfino
does for a living?

235
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,650
I'll see what I can do.

236
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,810
What do you mean you can't shoot her?

237
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,710
Francesco,if you can airbrush her acne,
you can airbrush the track marks.

238
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,460
Now don't call me again unless she O.D.S.

239
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,970
Gabrielle,ma petite fille!

240
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,760
Oh,sit!

241
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,740
You look amazing,younger than ever!

242
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,170
It's my new dermal filler.

243
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,920
It's banned here,so my assistant
smuggles it in from brazil.

244
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Isn't it fun?
I have my own drug mule.

245
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,070
that's great!

246
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,690
Well,I have some fun news of my own.

247
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,310
- I'm ready to model again.
- Really?

248
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,690
The last time we spoke,
you couldn't wait to quit.

249
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,720
You were giving it all up for love.
What happened to prince charmi?

250
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,890
Divorce.

251
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,850
oh,single again?

252
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,660
Isn't that ironic,since I'm the one you called--

253
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,790
oh,how did you put it?

254
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,730
A "career-obsessed lesbo who would die alone
and be eaten by her cats.¡±

255
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,820
- did I say that?

256
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,710
Water under the bridge.
I thought it was funny.

257
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,450
it's even funnier now.

258
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,810
Look,marcella,I'm back,and we made such
a great team before,and I think we can be again.

259
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,240
I don't know,darling.
Things are different now.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,310
You're not gonna be able to jump right back
in where you left off.

261
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:29,360
Well,I just wanna work.

262
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,850
Boy,I'm still not sure.

263
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,860
You know what might help?

264
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,320
If you groveled.

265
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,940
Are you serious?

266
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,120
Well,I-I can't tell because your
face doesn't move anymore.

267
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,400
No,I'm joking!
Welcome back,darling!

268
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,530
Hi.

269
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,070
Thank you.

270
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,840
well,hello there!

271
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,310
How pretty you look today!

272
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,250
It's wonderful that you're up and about!

273
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,250
You mu be enjoying these colorful balloons!

274
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,100
why are you talking to me like I'm a moron?

275
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,850
Oh,I'm--
I'm so sorry.

276
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,430
the--the nurse pointed me over here.
I'm--I'm looking for gloria hodge.

277
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm gloria hodge.

278
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Who might you be?

279
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,270
Well,I must say,I'm surprised
at how lucid you are.

280
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,620
Orson led me to believe--

281
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,810
that I was in the final stages of dementia?

282
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,430
no,I'm afraid that's just wishful
thinking on his part.

283
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,080
Well,how can he feel that way?
You're his mother.

284
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,020
I wouldn't judge him too harshly.

285
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,120
Ours is A...
complicated relationship.

286
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:59,470
There is love,to be sure,but we have
a way of disappointing each other.

287
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,580
Well,how does he disappoint you?

288
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:06,310
He's cold,rigid...

289
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,190
and...

290
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,600
and utterly incapable of
letting go of the past.

291
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,200
And how do youdisappoint him?

292
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,390
I rese to die.

293
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,590
Yes,I see.
Well,surely this rift isn't irreparable.

294
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,200
Do you know how people in nursing homes
spend their days,bree?

295
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,560
They think about the past and all the things
they'd do differently if they had the chance.

296
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,470
Please tell orson that I'm sorry,

297
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,870
and in spite of everything,I still love him.

298
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,540
Well,I have a better idea.
Why don't you tell him yourself?

299
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,830
that would be great.
I really appreciate it.

300
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,280
Okay.
Thank you.

301
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,270
So what did ed say?
When do you have to go back to work?

302
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,890
He said take as much time as I want with pay.

303
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,860
You should get gunned down more often.

304
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,430
- hey,there they are!
- hey,guys!

305
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,300
How was school?

306
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,620
Mommy,were you shot?

307
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,520
Shot?
Where did you hear that?

308
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,560
Jordan blackwelder.

309
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,170
That's the same little creep who tried to
ruin santa claus!

310
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:31,830
And he said that the same crazy lady that
shot you killed auntie nora dead.

311
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,030
It was on the news and everything.

312
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,580
Okay,listen,kids.
I am sorry.

313
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,300
We shouldn't have lied,but sometimes parents
wanna protect the kids fromcary things.

314
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,110
- And look,the good news is,mommy's fine now.
- Yeah.

315
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,000
And we'll all see auntie nora again in heaven.

316
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,400
Or wherever.

317
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,340
Did they let you keep the bullet?

318
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,940
no,no,afraid not.

319
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,640
That blows.
We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.

320
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,380
hey,sweetheart,you okay?

321
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,390
What if the crazy lady comes back?

322
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,300
She won'T.

323
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,690
- How do you know?
- Come on.

324
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,460
Well,because she'S...

325
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,620
up in heaven with auntie nora.

326
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,440
Or wherever.

327
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,200
julie mayer,you get back here!

328
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,740
You're grounded,remember?!

329
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,570
edie britt,I wanna talk to you.

330
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,930
I just survived a hostage situation.

331
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,870
Haven't I suffered enough for one week?

332
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,710
You keep your nephew away from
my daughter or else.

333
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,590
Look,I don't like it either,but the harder
we try to keep them apart,

334
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,840
the more they're gonna fight to be together.

335
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,610
Just let it run its course.

336
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you crazy?!

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,460
If we don't do something,
those two could end up having sex!

338
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,850
"Could"?

339
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,810
Oh,my god.

340
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,140
- You don't--
- let me put it this way--

341
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,230
I got a box of condoms in my dresser.
11 are gone.

342
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,610
Can only account for eight of 'em.

343
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,680
How can you be so calm about this?

344
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,830
- edie?
- Yeah?

345
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:29,730
Can you help me with this tie?
I...

346
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,180
- Hey.
- Mike...

347
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,270
you're out of the hospital.

348
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,290
Yeah.
He's home.

349
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,050
In fact,we're gonna go out
and celebrate tonight.

350
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,650
I'll be with you in one sec,okay,babe?

351
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,180
Yeah.

352
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:55,810
Since you asked,I'm calm because I know
if two people are meant to be together,

353
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,720
there's nothing anyone can do about it.

354
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,640
Okay,I should be back at around 6:00.
They can have one snack.

355
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,120
Try and push apples,but if they
threaten violence,

356
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,570
I have an emergency candy bar under the sink.

357
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,910
Not anymore you don'T.

358
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,600
Oh,jeez.

359
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,730
Mommy?
Where are you going?

360
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,040
- To the market.
- No!

361
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,210
Hey,sweetie,it's a different market.

362
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,430
- You're gonna get shot again.
- No,I won'T.

363
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,560
Lots of mommies go to the store every day,
and they're fine.

364
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,240
It's really not a scary place.

365
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,790
You went to the store,and you got shot,
and auntie nora died.

366
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm only gonna be in there ten minutes,
I promise.

367
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:44,280
Can't she go?

368
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,900
Fine.
I'll go.

369
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,600
Thanks.

370
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,230
Don't give a hoot if I get shot,do ya,kid?

371
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,530
You must be tanya.

372
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm gabrielle.
We're gonna be co-models today.

373
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,590
Now I don't know if you've ever done one of
these big shoots before,but don't be nervous.

374
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,780
Durkin and I are old friends.
He's a sweetheart.

375
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:29,950
now just remember,he's the king,
do extly what he says,
and you'll be fine.

376
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,020
I've been modeling for two years,

377
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,810
I've done six magazine covers,
and I'm sleeping with durkin.

378
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,230
Well,I guess you're all set then.

379
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,480
I've got some wardrobe choices.

380
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,110
I want to be buried in this dress!

381
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,940
This is for tanya.

382
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,850
The "mom" stuff is at the end.

383
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,620
"Mom"?

384
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,180
Okay,luv,let's get the blood pumping!

385
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,360
The concept is "lock up your daughters.

386
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,730
Okay? Get to work,everybody.

387
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,660
Tanya,I want you to hover down here on
the lawn,looking absolutely delicio.

388
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,180
thank you very much-- and up here on the
porch,mom and dad looking all scandalized.

389
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,380
Excuse me,durkin?

390
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,840
Yes,luv?

391
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,590
it's gaby.

392
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,000
Gabrielle marquez.
You shot me in milan,remember?

393
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,720
Yes! Yes!

394
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,240
Lovely to see you again.

395
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,700
Did you have a question then?

396
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,220
I do.

397
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,400
aren't you a little worried
that I'm gonna pull focus?

398
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,790
I mean,it's a little confusing.

399
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,550
People are gonna see tanya,
and then they're gonna.

400
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,870
see that guy,and they're
gonna wonder who I am.

401
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,730
You're the mum.

402
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,990
People aren't gonna buy that,
so here's what I was thinking.

403
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,010
I slap on one of those gow,

404
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,020
I play tanya's "big sister" home
from college to raise a little hell.

405
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,170
And we're gonna cram all
that on a subtitle,are we?

406
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,120
I'm sorry. Is just,
this outfit is hideous!

407
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:14,040
Just make it work.

408
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,090
Fine. I just need a moment
to get into character.

409
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,060
Gabrielle,what's the holdup?

410
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,830
We've got to get moving here.

411
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,860
Ready,ready!

412
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,060
what's that?

413
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh,I made it work. I'm "hot mom.

414
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,350
get me her agent.

415
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:51,640
Before we begin,would either of you
like some cookies,milk,lemonade,perhaps?

416
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,830
Mom,why are we here?

417
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,530
Ah,cutting to the chase. I like it.

418
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,140
I have a confession to make.

419
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,740
This whole dating drama has
been keeping me up at night,

420
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,670
and I hate being the bitchy,naggy mom.

421
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,450
When it comes to parenting,I am much
more comfortable playing the good cop.

422
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,410
Do you see where I'm
going with this,kids?

423
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,670
no

424
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,880
Well,in that case.

425
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,390
meet the bad cop.

426
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,740
daddy!

427
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,370
Hey,baby girl.

428
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,720
That the guy?

429
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:30,890
Yep! Get him.

430
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,730
this is so unfair.

431
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,110
Look,you defied my wishes,
you broke my rules.

432
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,400
Did you really think I was
just gonna throw in the towel?

433
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,700
Face it. I outsmarted you.

434
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,060
- who's ian?
- What?

435
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,200
You're dating some british guy named ian.

436
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,450
How did that come up?

437
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,230
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a big secret.

438
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,960
Hey,you know,when you said it was
true love with you and the plumber,

439
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,170
I-I was a good guy.

440
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,810
I stepped aside,and now
you're on to someone else.

441
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,300
Big picture,karl-- his hand
up our daughter's shirt.

442
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:16,390
- Don't change the subject!
- That is the subject!

443
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,390
How serious is it with this ian guy?

444
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,370
I don't know! It's--it's complicated.

445
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,860
Yeah,he's kind of married.

446
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,880
He's what?

447
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,470
It's not what you think.

448
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,310
Well,in her defense,
his wife is in a coma.

449
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,870
All right,that--that's it!

450
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,970
All right,I forbid
you to see this guy!

451
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
What?

452
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,430
No! I don't take orders from you!

453
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,530
Mom has a point,dad.

454
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,310
You can't tell a woman who
she can and can't date.

455
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,680
- It's her choice.
- Exactly. Thank you.

456
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,030
Wait,no,that does not apply toou.

457
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,600
You know,if you don't care about my
feelings,I don't know what I'm doing here.

458
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,780
Your feelings?

459
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,120
My god,you are the worst bad cop ever!

460
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:59,360
Go to your room.

461
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,470
Not you!

462
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,580
get back here! You're under arrest!

463
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,970
no,I'm not!

464
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,490
Hey,buddy,you've been reading
comic books for a while.

465
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,800
Don't you wanna go and play?

466
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,700
No,I-I wanna stay with you.

467
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,180
Yeah? Okay.

468
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,500
hey,art.

469
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,220
- Oh,hey! How are ya?
- Good.

470
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:40,100
listen,as if saving my life wasn't
enough,I have a little favor to ask.

471
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,220
Sure. What's up?

472
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,820
My kids are having a hard time.

473
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,830
They're pretty freaked out
by that whole supermarket thing.

474
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,120
You're my hostage!

475
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:49,720
Keep moving,or I'll
blow your face off!

476
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,360
okay,it's my turn. Give me the gun.

477
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,820
- Not so much them.
- right.

478
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,780
But my other son,parker.

479
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,850
so. back to the favor.

480
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,640
hey,parker,I want you to
meet our new neighbor,art.

481
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,200
He lives in the house ross the street.

482
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,140
His sister has the cool
wheelchair witthe joystick.

483
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,360
Hey there,parker.

484
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,280
Hi.

485
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,600
In the daytime,

486
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,430
art coaches swimming
at the rec center,but.

487
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,490
please,I can tell parker? Please?

488
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,020
And compromise my secret identity?
No way,mrs. Scavo. No way.

489
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,500
Secret identity?

490
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:38,180
Oh,great,now the cat's out of the bag.

491
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,150
Oh,might as well tell him.

492
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,780
It's okay. You can trust him,really.

493
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,820
Art is the one who saved
me at the supermarket.

494
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,800
He's sort of a superhero.

495
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,490
Give me a break.

496
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,020
It's true.

497
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,410
All right,if you're a
superhero,what's your name?

498
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,020
I'M. "protector man,"

499
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,550
because I protect people from bad guys.

500
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,550
You don't believe me,do you?

501
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,840
Okay.

502
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,100
I really shouldn't do this,but.

503
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,840
Did you really save my mom?

504
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,360
I really did.

505
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,370
He really did.

506
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,750
That's why you don't have to worry.

507
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,300
That's protector man's job.

508
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:45,740
Your job is to run
and play and have fun.

509
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,170
Okay?

510
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,280
- Okay.
- Okay.

511
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,810
Oh,my cousin nt to purdue.

512
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,180
What the hell?

513
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,200
Delfino.

514
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,760
Nice to see you up and about.

515
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:24,690
Here's our search warrant.

516
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,910
Search warrant? Let me see that.

517
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:34,200
How we doing?

518
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,090
We couldn't find a toolbox.

519
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,200
The man's a plumber. Keep looking.

520
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,650
Sir,I can't find a thing.

521
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,150
You tired?

522
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,960
you,come with me.

523
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,130
Marcella,look,I don't
know what they told you,

524
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,000
but all I'm asking for
is a simplcostume change.

525
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,650
You don't get to pull diva crap.

526
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,750
Tanya gets away with
it because she's a star.

527
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,640
You are nothing.

528
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:04,320
Where do you get off
talking to me like that?

529
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,100
I shot 36 covers by the time I was 20!

530
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,120
Well,you're 30 now.

531
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:12,910
When you make that face,you look 35.

532
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,160
Do you know how many photographers
would die to work with me again?

533
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,720
Yeah. Zero.

534
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,260
I had to call in major favors
just to get you this job.

535
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,680
I don't believe that.

536
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,920
Well,you know what I don't believe?

537
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,960
You gave up a brilliant career
to play house in the suburbs,

538
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,460
and the minute it falls apart,you come
back here expecting a homecoming parade.

539
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,960
Well,guess what,sweetie?

540
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,510
We've moved on.

541
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Now get your polyester ass over there

542
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,910
and act like the pro you used to be.

543
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,180
beautiful,tanya. That's it. Chin up.

544
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:48,060
Fantastic!

545
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,220
Mother,hold the plate higher.

546
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,220
beautiful,tanya. Oh,you are gorgeous!

547
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,940
Yes,girl! Lovely,lovely!

548
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,720
hiya,mike. Welcome home. You remember me?

549
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,400
Yeah,I-I think so.

550
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:09,340
The--the corner house with
all the gnomes out front?

551
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,140
You're thinking of martha huber.

552
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,180
Terrible story.

553
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,520
Someone beat her to death,and
then buried her in the forest.

554
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,590
Ironic,huh?

555
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,450
Isn't that where gnomes live?

556
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,490
I don't really know
that much about gnomes.

557
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,610
Anyway,I know the cops were here earlier.

558
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,870
So?

559
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,750
Well,you won't remember this,
but one night two years ago,

560
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,060
you drove me to the hospital
after I had an attack of angina.

561
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,330
Probably saved my life.

562
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,460
Anyway,I figure I owe ya. Here.

563
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,230
You might wann wash that wrench off.

564
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,620
It's got something on it.

565
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,500
Sorry I'm late. Mrs.Prescott broke a crown and.

566
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,910
orson,how well you look.

567
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,930
Hello,mother.

568
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,340
A word,darling?

569
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,090
I can't believe you did this!

570
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,300
And I can't believe you told me
that she was senile! You lied to me.

571
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:17,190
Yes,to spare us the misery of her
company. You don't know her,bree.

572
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,020
She's a loathsome woman,and I
refuse to break bread with her.

573
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,990
Now you listen to me. That woman gave you life,

574
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,720
and the fifth commandment tells us to honor our
parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be.

575
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,060
- That's not exactly what-
- orson,it's implied!

576
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,950
Now get out there anshow her some spect!

577
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,320
Fine,but if you expect anything
more from me than forced civility,

578
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,870
you will be deeply disappointed.

579
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,770
Bree,this salmon is superb.

580
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,310
Well,thank you!

581
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,190
It did win me the blue ribbon
at the gourmet county cookoff.

582
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,890
I just love the sauce.

583
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,590
What gives it that kick?

584
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,280
You'd never ask a magician
how a trick is done.

585
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,200
you've barely touched your salmon,dear.

586
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,380
Is everything okay?

587
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,270
Yes.

588
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,190
I was just wondering why you're here.

589
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,270
I want us to be friends.

590
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,030
Okay,let's suppose I just had a
massive head injury and believe you.

591
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,770
We're pals. Now what do you want?

592
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,260
Orson,why does she have to
have an ulterior motive?

593
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,760
I want out of that home.

594
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,180
Ah,there it is.

595
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,530
It's a hellhole! Besides,
I'm perfectly healthy now.

596
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,950
My hip is better,I can handle the stairs,

597
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,990
and you said when I got strong
enough I'd get to go back to my house.

598
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,360
Oh,here's the thing-- I sold it.

599
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,060
What?

600
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,970
You hed me.

601
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,480
What about my things?

602
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,070
All gone. Oh,I also sold the car.

603
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,520
See,that's the thing about hellholes.

604
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,590
They don't pay for themselves.

605
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,330
How dare you? You had no right!

606
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,540
Okay! Maybe I will share
my secret ingredient.

607
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,420
I should have smothered you in
your crib when I h the chance.

608
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,040
Paprika! There,it's out!

609
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,700
That's the mother I remember!

610
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,650
I was wondering when she'd show up.

611
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,070
Yes,orson,I am your mother,

612
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,910
so you more than anyone should
know how I deal with betrayal.

613
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,930
So. can we call her grandma?

614
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,520
I've got one more load,and
then I'm gonna do my homework.

615
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,520
Do you have anything you
want me to throw in?

616
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,600
No,I'm good. Thanks.

617
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:57,330
Mom,listen.

618
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,780
I know I've put you through
the wringer lately,and I'm sorry.

619
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,680
16 years of being perfect.

620
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,720
You were due.

621
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,020
That's what I don't get.

622
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,740
You've always trusted my judgment.

623
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:14,950
Why can't you trust me about austin?

624
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,730
Relationships have nothing
to do with good judgment.

625
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,410
It doesn't matter how smart you are.

626
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,010
You can still get hurt.

627
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:29,700
You do your homework.
I'm gonna finish the laundry.

628
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,800
Okay.

629
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,530
there you go,mrs. H.

630
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,830
All right.

631
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:56,370
- Can I use your bathroom,just.
- come on in.

632
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,600
Please,stay for dessert.

633
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,970
I'll work on orson,and
we'll discuss this together.

634
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,120
You saw what he sentenced me to--

635
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,040
a room no better
than a furnished coffin.

636
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,520
I have nothing to say to him.

637
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,150
Well,then talk to me.

638
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,920
I know you're upset,but
don't shut me out. Please.

639
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,640
Please,gloria,let me in.

640
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,240
Well,I. I didn't mean
it literally,but okay.

641
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:27,180
We'll,um,we'll sit together. and we'll talk.

642
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,580
What are you doing?

643
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,050
I'm not going back to that place.

644
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,530
Gloria,stop!

645
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,800
Let's get my mother back
to the home,shall we?

646
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,030
not that it's any of my business,but,
is everything okay with you folks?

647
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,020
Oh,yeah,there was a little tension earlier,
but I think it's all been resolved.

648
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,130
oh,what the hell?

649
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,090
no,I absolutely forbid it!

650
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,920
Just for a few weeks till we find
a place where she'll be happier.

651
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,820
You should've heard her in the car.

652
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,460
She's absolutely miserable
in that nursing home.

653
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,850
I don't care.

654
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,810
My mother's not moving in here
till she fits in a jar on the mantle.

655
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,530
how can you be so cold?

656
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,230
You don't know who she is.

657
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,580
I've worked my entire life to
get away from that woman.

658
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:21,540
Why?

659
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,580
What could she possibly have done
to make you hate her so much?

660
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,850
Look,there is nothing to be
gained by dredginup the past.

661
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,430
Orson,if there's something I should know.

662
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,660
could I speak to my son a moment?

663
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,100
Of course.

664
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,620
so you know,I've decided to
accept your wife's kind invitation.

665
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,140
I won't allow it.

666
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,140
Oh,I think you will.

667
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,140
We're going to end our
quarrel right now,

668
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,760
or I'll tell your
wife what it's about.

669
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,070
You wouldn'T.

670
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,900
Just try me.

671
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,290
I gave you life.

672
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,820
You know I won't hesitate to take it away.

673
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:24,020
Now give mother a kiss.

674
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,730
Why in the hell would I wanna do that?

675
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:50,270
Hey,you're back!

676
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,660
I'd give you a hug,but I'm really sweaty.

677
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,650
- So how was new york?
- Oh,it was fine.

678
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,310
Bree said you got a job on the first day.

679
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,820
You're such a star! I want details.

680
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:03,790
you know,just hours and hours
of sitting around,looking pretty.

681
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,300
but I think I'm done with modeling.

682
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,990
So you're not gonna move to new york?

683
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,190
Well,if something great
comes up,I-I might fly out,

684
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,600
but I'm pretty settled here.

685
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,890
oh,thank god!

686
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,650
We were all so worried
we were losing you.

687
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,750
Okay,now I'm hugging you.

688
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,350
oh,it's amazing.
Your life is such an adventure.

689
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,950
Can't wait to see what you do next.

690
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,120
yeah,me,too.

691
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Okay.

692
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,860
Mr. Protector man?

693
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,310
That's a secret. Hello?

694
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,930
Hello?

695
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,300
Ah,sweet!

696
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,510
mom,look!

697
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,130
Hey,don't touch anything.

698
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,270
I'm just gonna write a
note,and then we'll go.

699
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,960
Okay.

700
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,160
Parker? Hey!

701
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,500
Come back here!

702
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,050
Honey? Come on,we're leaving.

703
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,120
Parker.

704
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,180
Parker,come on,we're leaving.

705
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,510
Why didn't you come when I called?

706
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,130
superhero houses are great!

707
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,470
Parker,come on,
we're gonna get out ofere.

708
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,880
- Why?
- Oh,I just say so.

709
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:19,280
Come on.

710
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,830
There are so many things
we wis we could tell the young.

711
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,530
We'd like to persuade them
not to grow up so fast,

712
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,200
but they won't listen.

713
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:43,060
We want to tell them that beauty fades.

714
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,610
But they refuse to believe it.

715
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,170
we warn them that their
actions will have consequences,

716
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:57,410
but still they defy us.

717
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:04,090
Sadly,the young can't begin to understand
the world is a dangerous place.

718
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,960
So it's up to us to do
anything we can to protect them.

719
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,810
What if I told you there is a
way you could help children.

720
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,140
absolutely anything.

721
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,000
