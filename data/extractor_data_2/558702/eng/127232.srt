<i>Previously on <b>Desperate Housewives</b>:

2
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:03,500
Is anybody here?

3
00:00:03,535 --> 00:00:06,300
It appears there may have been
a breakdown in our chain of care.

4
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,900
Are you trying to buy us off?

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,300
<i>Sometimes, if you're not careful...

6
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,500
There's this place called Camp Hennessy.

7
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm not going to a stupid camp
for juvenile delinquents!

8
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:15,500
You don't have a choice.

9
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,400
<i>...past mistakes...

10
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,200
We pulled it out of Rockwater Lake.

11
00:00:19,235 --> 00:00:21,300
I must have sold several hundreds of these,
just like it.

12
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:24,200
We have a list of customers' names on file.

13
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:26,100
<i>...will come back to haunt you.

14
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:30,135
I won't tell anyone.
I'll keep your secret, Dad.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,800
<i>There were many things
Gabrielle Solís knew for certain.

16
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:42,935
<i>She knew red was her color.

17
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:46,700
<i>She knew diamonds went with everything.

18
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:50,735
<i>And she knew men were all the same.

19
00:00:53,835 --> 00:00:57,835
<i>But the one thing
Gabrielle knew above all else:

20
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,935
<i>she would never want children.

21
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:09,335
<i>Unfortunately for Gabrielle,
her husband Carlos felt differently.

22
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm so lucky to have you.

23
00:01:30,135 --> 00:01:33,200
OK, I'll bite.

24
00:01:33,235 --> 00:01:35,600
Why are you so lucky?

25
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,900
Because --

26
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:41,935
I don't want to have kids and you do.
- Oh, that.

27
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:46,300
Most men would leave over something like that.

28
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:49,300
And you're still here.

29
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:53,335
I'm grateful.
I know the sacrifice you're making.

30
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:57,400
There's still a little part of me
that's hoping you'd change your mind.

31
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:01,300
Once you had a baby,
I think you'd love it so much that...

32
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,700
Honey --

33
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:04,800
it's not gonna happen.

34
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,200
You never know.

35
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:08,500
No, sometimes you do.

36
00:02:08,535 --> 00:02:12,535
Well, it is a sacrifice.

37
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:18,135
But you're worth it.

38
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:24,535
<i>Yes, Gabrielle Solís knew without a doubt
she didn't want to be a mother.

39
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:28,300
<i>But what she couldn't know was

40
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:31,500
<i>how much her husband
wanted to be a father.

41
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,235
<i>Or that he'd been tampering
with her birth control for months.

42
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:42,935
<i>Or that within one week's time

43
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:49,735
<i>she would be pregnant.

00:02:51,635 --> 00:02:55,635
episode 18
CHILDREN WILL LISTEN

45
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:35,735
<i>Saturdays on Wisteria Lane
belong to the children.

46
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:41,735
<i>And while most would spend the day
practicing their sports

47
00:03:42,835 --> 00:03:46,835
<i>and riding their bikes

48
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,700
<i>and jumping their ropes,

49
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:53,300
<i>others were no longer
engaged in child's play.

50
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:57,335
<i>Indeed, some children were being forced
to grow up very quickly.

51
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:01,500
Sorry to bother you on the weekend.
We have a few questions.

52
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:03,300
About what?

53
00:04:03,335 --> 00:04:07,335
12 years ago, your late wife
purchased a toy chest.

54
00:04:08,935 --> 00:04:11,100
Toy chest.

55
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:13,300
Yes, about this big and

56
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:15,500
with little dancing bears on it?

57
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:18,100
Gosh, I'm sorry.

58
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:21,900
The craftsman who makes these chests
keeps a list of customers.

59
00:04:21,935 --> 00:04:25,900
Apparently you purchased one
in August 1992.

60
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:29,200
We'd like to know
where that chest is now.

61
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,600
Well, I wish I could help you.

62
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:34,800
I don't recall any toy chest.

63
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:35,900
I remember.

64
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:39,100
It had little bears and blooms on it, right?

65
00:04:39,135 --> 00:04:40,900
Yes, son, that's right.

66
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,934
We threw that chest away
when I was little.

67
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:47,134
I was standing on it and it busted.
Remember, Dad?

68
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:51,035
Vaguely.

69
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:55,735
I guess that's all then.
Thank you both for your time.

70
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:58,200
Hey --

71
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:00,400
what's the deal with this chest anyway?

72
00:05:00,435 --> 00:05:03,400
One just like you had
washed up on Torch Lake.

73
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,200
Had a woman in it.

74
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:09,235
A woman?

75
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:13,335
She was all chopped up.

76
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:25,935
Obviously, we need to talk.

77
00:05:29,735 --> 00:05:31,200
You lie filth.

78
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:32,200
You said there was a man in the box!

79
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:34,000
No, I didn't lie.

80
00:05:34,035 --> 00:05:37,100
The policeman said it was a woman's body!
Of course you lied!

81
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:39,400
I told you a private detective would come
to take you away from us.

82
00:05:39,435 --> 00:05:42,900
I never said it was a man.

83
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:44,700
You didn't?
- No.

84
00:05:44,735 --> 00:05:47,100
Why--I--I thought that...
- No.

85
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,800
Stop, please, stop, I--
I know that you're lying for me.

86
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:51,800
Ok, I know that you're lying.

87
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,500
For the last time:

88
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,000
Someone came and
tried to take you away from us--

89
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,900
Yes, a woman!

90
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,900
A woman came.
- Yes, she tried to steal you.

91
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,700
From the only family
that you've ever really known.

92
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:05,200
And we couldn't let that happen.

93
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:07,000
And we didn't.

94
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:11,035
And that--is the truth.

95
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,100
We can't cancel now,
it's two days away!

96
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,900
Rex, I'm not going.
That's all there is to it.

97
00:06:21,935 --> 00:06:24,400
Counselling is part of the treatment
at Camp Hennessy. You knew that.

98
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:27,600
Nowhere in that brochure did it say
that we were expected to attend.

99
00:06:27,635 --> 00:06:30,000
What will Andrew think
if you don't show up?

100
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:34,035
I'm making him his care package!
He'll know that I'm thinking about him.

101
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,300
Why are you putting in lemon squares?

102
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:38,400
They told us not to send him sweets.

103
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,600
Well, I don't understand why.

104
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:43,635
I guess they feel baked goods from Mom
undercut the boot camp experience.

105
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:46,900
Fine! I won't send them.
But I think it's a stupid rule.

106
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:49,200
So are you going to this thing or not?

107
00:06:49,235 --> 00:06:50,100
No.
- Why?

108
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:52,900
Because the minute I get there,
Andrew will start

109
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:55,600
attacking me for abandoning him.

110
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:56,500
And I don't want to hear it.

111
00:06:56,535 --> 00:07:00,535
There's no reason to feel guilty.
You did everything you could for him.

112
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:05,635
I don't feel guilty.

113
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:11,935
OK.

114
00:07:22,035 --> 00:07:23,200
Please, Christie--

115
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:27,235
there's no way I can get another babysitter
this late in the day.

116
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:31,000
Parker! Knock it off!

117
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:34,100
Because I'm having drinks
with friends I used to work with,

118
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:36,000
and they never call,
and if I blow them off,

119
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:40,000
that's it. I'm dead to them.

120
00:07:40,035 --> 00:07:43,800
No, I can't call Patty Binks.

121
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,700
Because she steals things.
Damn it, Christie, you're 13.

122
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:50,800
You got a lot of trips to the mall
ahead of you.

123
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:54,835
OK. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I raised my boys.-- I'm calm.

124
00:07:56,135 --> 00:07:58,300
I'm starting to think
this is about money.

125
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:01,900
So what is it
that will make it worth your while?

126
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:05,500
$100? That's extorsion!
There's no way in hell that I--

127
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:09,535
Hello? Hello?

128
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:14,335
Parker, I swear I will spank you!
Knock it off!

129
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:19,935
Hi, Mrs Binks. Is Patty there?
Thank you.

130
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,135
Hi honey, I'm back.

131
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:28,100
Hey sweetie.

132
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,700
This is Mr Steinberg,
the attorney from the hospital.

133
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, have we met?

134
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:35,300
Yes, Mrs Solís. We've met.

135
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,300
Don't you remember?

136
00:08:36,335 --> 00:08:38,600
Was that when Mamá died?

137
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:40,800
Apparently, the hospital was negligent

138
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:44,200
and agreed to a 7-figure settlement cheque.

139
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:47,500
A cheque I was never told about.

140
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:51,535
Oh, that!

141
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:54,600
Uh--

142
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:55,600
Mr Steinberg--

143
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,635
I was just leaving.

144
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:10,800
What were you thinking?!

145
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:12,100
Wait! Let me explain!

146
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,000
No!
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

147
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:16,300
Because I couldn't trust you
to make the right decision.

148
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:19,000
The right decision was
to use that money for my lawyers.

149
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:20,500
We could have bought the indictment,

150
00:09:20,535 --> 00:09:21,800
and I wouldn't have had to
take a plea bargain.

151
00:09:21,835 --> 00:09:24,900
If you didn't take the plea deal,
the Government would have seized the settlement.

152
00:09:24,935 --> 00:09:26,300
Ow, we could have bought that at court.

153
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:29,000
Exactly, and then you would have
blown all the money into the lawyers!

154
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,800
Who cares? If there was a chance
that I'd have to go to jail?

155
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:36,400
You had Laotian convicts
sowing casual wear for 2¢/h.

156
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:39,100
Don't you think you deserve a time out?

157
00:09:39,135 --> 00:09:42,900
8 months! Thanks to you,
I'm going away for 8 months!

158
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:46,935
And when you get out, we have money
to start over with. Thanks to me.

159
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:52,800
You know,
once you calm down

160
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:55,500
you'll realize I did the right thing.

161
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:59,535
And when that happens,
I'd appreciate an apology.

162
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:17,935
Grandma's here!

163
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:29,535
Now that is just perfect.
Stay put.

164
00:10:33,135 --> 00:10:35,200
I'm so sorry--

165
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,200
Hey, Mom!

166
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,900
Hey Susan.
I goofed.

167
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:41,735
What happened?

168
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:45,735
Oh, you know me.
No depth perception whatsoever.

169
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,300
Some day I gonna shoot my licence.

170
00:10:48,335 --> 00:10:50,300
So you're Susan's mom?

171
00:10:50,335 --> 00:10:54,335
Yeah.
I'm Sophie Bremer. And you are?

172
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:56,100
Mike Delfino.

173
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh! You're Mike?

174
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:03,435
Oh my god!
Susan's told me so much about you!

175
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:07,835
Don't you stand there,
give me a hug!

176
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:14,635
Mom-- Mike and I aren't--
together anymore.

177
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,300
Oh.

178
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:20,500
Sorry.

179
00:11:20,535 --> 00:11:22,800
I guess I just made this very awkward, ha?

180
00:11:22,835 --> 00:11:25,700
Yeah, you really did.

181
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:29,600
So let's call your insurance company.

182
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:33,300
Well--
it's nice meeting you anyway, Mike.

183
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:36,000
You too. And I'd never guessed
that you're Susan's mom.

184
00:11:36,035 --> 00:11:38,900
I know. I look too young.

185
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,600
I got pregnant when I was a tiny teenager.

186
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:42,600
OK.

187
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:45,800
That was the first time I got drunk.
Ever. Can you believe it?

188
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:46,635
Let's go.

189
00:11:46,635 --> 00:11:48,000
Her father was a Marine.

190
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:51,600
Afterwards, he gave me
three of his medals.

191
00:11:51,635 --> 00:11:53,600
Mom!

192
00:11:53,635 --> 00:11:56,800
Let's just go inside
and call the insurance company.

193
00:11:56,835 --> 00:12:00,835
All right.

194
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,900
What are you smiling about?

195
00:12:09,935 --> 00:12:11,800
I used to have all these questions

196
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:14,900
about how you got to be the way you are.

197
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:18,935
They're all just answered.

198
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,300
Hi!

199
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Hi!

200
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,300
Hi! What's going on?

201
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:47,700
Oh, um--

202
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,200
My babysitter cancelled.

203
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,600
Oh Lynette, I--
I'm so swamped today.

204
00:12:51,635 --> 00:12:55,500
My house is a mess, and
I've got millions of errands to run, so--

205
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,300
Please, hear me out.
This is important.

206
00:12:57,335 --> 00:13:01,300
Today I have a chance to
rejoin the human race for a few hours.

207
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:04,400
There are actual adults
waiting for me with Margaritas.

208
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:07,300
Look, I'm in a dress!
I have make-up on!

209
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:13,335
If it were any other day--
- For god's sakes, Bree, I'm wearing pantyhose!

210
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:15,600
Bring them in.

211
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:18,800
Thank you, thank you.
OK, in you go!

212
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:21,700
And then the police showed me his mugshot.
- No!

213
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:25,300
Yes! Mike served time
for selling drugs and manslaughter.

214
00:13:25,335 --> 00:13:27,800
I can't believe it.
- Well, it's true.

215
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:30,600
He has such nice manners, you know?

216
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:33,000
I know.

217
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:37,035
Suzie-- I don't want you
worrying too much about this Mike thing.

218
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,900
The right man will come along.

219
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:44,000
Just give it time.

220
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:48,035
I think I would have given up entirely
if it weren't for you and Morty.

221
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,600
Morty?
- Yeah, you know--

222
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:54,635
It's the 3rd time round for both of you,
and you're really clicking.

223
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,835
Gives me hope.

224
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,000
What's wrong?

225
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:05,035
Nothing, nothing. I'm just-- tired.

226
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:09,535
You're not tired. You took a nap.
What is it?

227
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,500
I left Morty.

228
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,200
What? Why?

229
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:16,600
Because he shoved me.

230
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:18,200
Morty? No!

231
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:21,300
You think I'm lying?
Fine!

232
00:14:21,335 --> 00:14:22,500
Why would he shove you?

233
00:14:22,535 --> 00:14:24,500
Because I confronted him

234
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:28,400
about how much time he was spending
at that damn pancake restaurant.

235
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,000
If that's where he's really been.

236
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,700
You can't be serious. Morty?

237
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:34,900
You think men his age don't have needs?

238
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:38,935
You should see the waitresses he hires.
Every year they get younger and younger.

239
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:43,500
Maybe you just feel that way because
every year you get older and older.

240
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:45,300
That's a horrible thing to say.

241
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:46,135
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm not that old.

243
00:14:47,135 --> 00:14:49,300
I said I was sorry.

244
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,300
People think we are sisters.

245
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:53,100
Well, that's 'cause you tell them that.

246
00:14:53,135 --> 00:14:57,000
One time! You gotta like all that.

247
00:14:57,035 --> 00:15:01,035
OK, look. I'm just saying
I don't think Morty cheated on you.

248
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:05,735
Well he did shove me.
The least you can do is be supportive.

249
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:09,900
You're right.
You're right!

250
00:15:09,935 --> 00:15:12,000
He also threw a book at me.

251
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh come on!

252
00:15:15,435 --> 00:15:19,300
I mean-- he shouldn't have done that.

253
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,335
Thank you.

254
00:15:34,735 --> 00:15:36,700
Porter, honey, those cookies are hot.

255
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:40,735
Wait a few minutes,
I'll give you one when they're cool, OK?

256
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:45,835
Um-- you know, pictures are prettier
if you color inside the lines.

257
00:15:50,135 --> 00:15:54,135
Well, art is subjective.

258
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,600
Porter! What did I tell you?

259
00:15:56,635 --> 00:15:57,700
But I'm hungry!

260
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:01,735
Then I will fix you a very nice
bowl of peaches and cottage cheese.

261
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,600
Ew, barf!

262
00:16:03,635 --> 00:16:06,600
Don't be common, young man!
Now come on.

263
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:08,400
If you play around
with those cookies one more time,

264
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm gonna have to spank you!

265
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,300
We don't get spanked.
- Really?

266
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:16,300
Mummy always says she's gonna,
but she never does.

267
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:20,335
Well, I am not your mummy,
and if you misbehave in my house,

268
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,935
you will get spanked.
So be good.

269
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,500
It was an accident!

270
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:46,200
Porter, I warned you.

271
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm sorry. I'll be good.

272
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:52,300
Those cookies were made from scratch.

273
00:16:52,335 --> 00:16:55,400
Your fate is sealed!

274
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:58,700
Come here.
- No, no!

275
00:16:58,735 --> 00:17:02,735
Ow! Ow! Ow! Owwww!

276
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,100
What's that?

277
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:11,900
It's called a postnuptial agreement.

278
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,100
It's a legal document that--

279
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:17,135
I know what a postnup is.
What is it doing on my coffee table?

280
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, I can forgive that stunt you pulled
with the settlement cheque,

281
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:24,900
if I'm sure that you'll really be around
when I get out of jail.

282
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,300
Hm.

283
00:17:26,335 --> 00:17:30,100
And the postnup
changes the terms of the prenup, so--

284
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:33,900
So if you try and divorce me
while I'm gone,

285
00:17:33,935 --> 00:17:35,900
you get nothing.

286
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,100
You don't trust me?

287
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,100
Free, no.

288
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:43,135
Well, that's too bad,
because I'm not signing that paper.

289
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,500
You're a very beautiful woman, Gabrielle,

290
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:51,535
but-- you're not very bright.

291
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:54,800
See, if you don't sign it,

292
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:58,200
I'll pull the plug on the settlement agreement,
divorce you,

293
00:17:58,235 --> 00:18:02,235
and then you get
about 50% of our current savings,

294
00:18:03,435 --> 00:18:07,435
which is basically nothing.

295
00:18:08,035 --> 00:18:11,700
So what do you expect to happen
now, Carlos?

296
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:15,100
I sign the paper and
jump right back into your arms?

297
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,700
It doesn't mean that I don't love you.

298
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:21,735
I think you're the perfect woman.

299
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:29,935
Oh, but I'm not.
I have flaws.

300
00:18:31,035 --> 00:18:35,035
Flaws?
- M-hm. I'll give you an example.

301
00:18:35,535 --> 00:18:39,535
Remember when you were in jail
and you told me about your secret compartment?

302
00:18:39,935 --> 00:18:43,500
And you told me to burn the papers
that I found in there?

303
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:47,535
Well, me being pretty and therefore stupid,
I forgot.

304
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,200
You didn't burn the papers.

305
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,800
Worse.
I read them.

306
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:55,635
OK--

307
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,700
You have some nerve
talking to me about trust

308
00:18:57,735 --> 00:19:00,000
when you have a secret bank account
on the Cayman Islands!

309
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:02,400
That was a safety net
for both of us!

310
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:03,700
I'll bet.

311
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,300
Have you told anyone else about this?

312
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,300
No. But I could.

313
00:19:07,335 --> 00:19:11,000
Hey, isn't that why the prosecution
didn't have a case against you?

314
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,800
They couldn't find the profits you made.

315
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,900
So if I were you, Carlos,

316
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:17,200
I wouldn't mention the words
"divorce",

317
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,600
"trust",

318
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,400
"postnup" ever again.

319
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:24,435
You don't want to piss me off.

320
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:35,035
I know, baby.
It hurts to lose.

321
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:45,300
Ante up.

322
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:49,335
Well, look at me!
Finally in at one of your legendary Poker Parties.

323
00:19:51,235 --> 00:19:54,300
Susan's always telling me
how much fun you girls have.

324
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:55,500
The rules are simple:

325
00:19:55,535 --> 00:19:57,800
We play for cash,
the dealer picks the game,

326
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:01,835
and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.
- Aaah!

327
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,000
Bree, thanks again for watching my boys.
Sure they weren't too much to handle?

328
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, no. We had a wonderful time.

329
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:09,800
Although I think
Porter had a little less fun.

330
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,300
OK, I'll bet.

331
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:15,335
Sophie, Susan said you guys are
going to the spa tomorrow? All day?

332
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:18,600
What do you mean, Porter had less fun?
I'll raise.

333
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,300
He was misbehaving,
so I had to punish him.

334
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:25,000
So, yes! Susan is treating me
to an entire day of...

335
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:28,300
If you say punishment,
what exactly are we talking about?

336
00:20:28,335 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, I had to spank him.

337
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:33,200
OK, I will re-raise.

338
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:37,235
You spanked my son?

339
00:20:38,535 --> 00:20:42,535
Las Brisas spa.
Yep, that's where we're going!

340
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:47,900
Lynette, is there a problem?

341
00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:49,900
Tom and I don't believe in hitting our kids.
I thought you knew that.

342
00:20:49,935 --> 00:20:53,200
Sorry. I didn't know.

343
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:56,500
It won't happen again.

344
00:20:56,535 --> 00:20:59,800
Of course, I'm somewhat surprised
you don't spank them.

345
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:03,835
Everybody knows they're a little bit--
out of control.

346
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm just dragging today.
Should we put on another pot of coffee?

347
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:12,700
Yeah, I'll do it.

348
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,300
I'll-- I fold.

349
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:19,100
Yeah, you're right, Bree.
I've got a lot to learn about parenting.

350
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:23,135
I feel blessed to get sage advice
from such an impeccable mother like you.

351
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,700
I mean, your kids turned out perfect.
As long as you don't count Andrew.

352
00:21:26,735 --> 00:21:29,300
Where is he again? Hm?

353
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:32,700
Some kind of, uh--
boot camp for juvenile delinquents?

354
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:34,500
OK, girls.

355
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,500
I never said I was perfect.

356
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:39,800
Oh honey, nobody's blaming you.
- The hell I'm not.

357
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:43,835
Lynette!

358
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:51,735
If you will excuse me.

359
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:55,500
Lynette, won't you go after her?

360
00:21:55,535 --> 00:21:59,535
She spanked my son.
I'm not apologizing.

361
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:08,835
Usually poker is more fun than this.

362
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:13,100
Help me. If you don't
back me up on this, I will lose it.

363
00:22:13,135 --> 00:22:15,700
Yes, Bree shouldn't have
spanked Porter, but--

364
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,500
it's not like she hurt him.

365
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:20,900
That is not the point.
You don't spank other people's children!

366
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:24,200
He was misbehaving.
She had to do something.

367
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:27,900
B-but make no mistake,
she definitely crossed the line.

368
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:31,200
Yeah, you're damn right, she could've
tried something else, like a time-out.

369
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:34,000
Or she could've simply
threatened to spank him.

370
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah. 'Cause that works out so well
when we do it.

371
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:40,300
It does work.
Most of the time.

372
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:42,100
It used to work.

373
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:46,135
They figured out it's an empty threat.
They're on to us.

374
00:22:46,635 --> 00:22:50,100
My mom used to beat the hell out of
my sisters and me.

375
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,300
And I won't do it.

376
00:22:53,335 --> 00:22:57,335
I will not become my mother.

377
00:22:59,935 --> 00:23:03,935
Fine.
But the boys are getting older and smarter.

378
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:08,800
And eventually --believe me--
they'll figure out that they outnumber us.

379
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:12,835
And then--
- We're screwed.

380
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:17,035
Exactly.

381
00:23:29,135 --> 00:23:33,135
Excuse me, Zachary.
Would you mind helping me with these bags?

382
00:23:33,435 --> 00:23:36,600
There's some banana bread in it for you
if you do.

383
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:40,635
Uh-- yeah, sure.

384
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:44,000
Hm. This is really good, Mrs Tilman.
Thanks a lot.

385
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:46,300
You're welcome, Zachary.

386
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:48,800
I've never actually been
in Mrs Huber's house before.

387
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,800
Obviously you haven't missed much.

388
00:23:51,835 --> 00:23:55,835
This is the place where
good taste goes to die.

389
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:03,700
So-- I heard you and your father
arguing the other day.

390
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,000
Evetrything all right at home?

391
00:24:05,035 --> 00:24:09,035
Yeah.
We just have-- problems sometimes.

392
00:24:09,835 --> 00:24:13,200
I bet you miss your mother.

393
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:17,235
I'm sure things were different
when she was alive.

394
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:21,835
Such a warm, loving woman.

395
00:24:23,835 --> 00:24:27,000
You--

396
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:28,700
knew my mother?

397
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:31,100
Yup.
Years ago, in Utah.

398
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:33,700
We worked together.

399
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:36,000
I didn't know that.

400
00:24:36,035 --> 00:24:38,300
It's true.

401
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,500
In fact--

402
00:24:41,535 --> 00:24:44,600
I'll tell you a secret.

403
00:24:44,635 --> 00:24:48,635
I once met you
when you were a little baby.

404
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,300
Really?

405
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:54,000
M-hm.

406
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:58,035
Your mother loved you so much, Zachary.

407
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:05,835
Of all the things I remember,
I remember that the most.

408
00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:21,735
You want to know
what else I remember?

409
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:27,135
How lovely your original name was.

410
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:37,235
Dana.

411
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,900
Isn't this nice.

412
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:51,935
Just the two of us girls
hanging out, getting pretty.

413
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:56,735
Aw, thank you!
- My pleasure.

414
00:25:57,835 --> 00:26:01,600
So-- I was thinking
maybe you should call Morty.

415
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:05,635
You know, to start
working things out?

416
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:10,400
Why would I want to work things out
with a man who abuses me?

417
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,400
Oh, you don't have to gasp.
My mother-- exaggerates.

418
00:26:13,435 --> 00:26:15,500
She won't be happy
till I have bruises.

419
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:19,000
OK, um-- can we just focus?
What I want to know is,

420
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:23,035
have you thought about what'll happen
if you don't go back to Morty?

421
00:26:24,335 --> 00:26:26,500
What do you mean?

422
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:29,400
You don't have a place to live,
you don't like to work,

423
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:33,435
you didn't want to marry Morty,
so he doesn't have to pay you alimony--

424
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:37,535
if you don't go back to this man who
allegedly shoved you once in 5 years,

425
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:41,500
what are your options?

426
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:43,500
I thought I could live with you.

427
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,800
What?

428
00:26:45,835 --> 00:26:47,100
Oh my god, are you all right?

429
00:26:47,135 --> 00:26:51,135
Get away!
- I'm so sorry-- Lean back.

430
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,800
I'm not saying permanently.
Just for a couple of years.

431
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:55,200
You broge by dose!

432
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,900
No, no, it's just banged a little.

433
00:26:56,935 --> 00:27:00,300
Till I get back on my feet.
- Can we talk about this later?

434
00:27:00,335 --> 00:27:01,800
Should we call 911?

435
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:03,900
No, it's just a nosebleed. She's fine.

436
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:05,400
Won't you be excited by the idea?

437
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:07,800
It's not that I'm not excited.

438
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,835
I'm not stupid, Susan.
It's obvious you don't want me here.

439
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:15,700
No, that's not true! Mom--

440
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:19,200
Don't go! Mom, come back!

441
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:22,600
I need to--
We're good, right?

442
00:27:22,635 --> 00:27:26,635
Just go!

443
00:28:11,635 --> 00:28:14,500
Why aren't you dressed yet?

444
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:18,535
I wanted to wear Andrew's favorite color,
and then I realized--

445
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:23,200
I don't know what it is.

446
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:27,235
I think the fact you decided to come at all
would make him happy.

447
00:28:27,535 --> 00:28:31,535
Yours is blue.
Danielle loves pink.

448
00:28:33,335 --> 00:28:36,800
And I have no idea
what my own son's favorite color is.

449
00:28:36,835 --> 00:28:38,700
I'm telling you,
it doesn't matter.

450
00:28:38,735 --> 00:28:41,800
How can you say that?
Of course it matters!

451
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:43,800
Bree--
- That is what makes a good mother!

452
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:46,300
Someone who knows their child
inside and out,

453
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:50,335
so that if they get in trouble,
they know what to do.

454
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:56,435
I don't know him well enough.

455
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:03,735
You are a good mother.

456
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,635
Brown or green or--
just don't know.

457
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:18,335
I'll wait in the car.
Whenever you're ready.

458
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:28,600
Green.

459
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:32,635
I'll go with the green.
Everybody loves green.

460
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:56,300
Told you.
I'm not signing this.

461
00:29:56,335 --> 00:29:59,800
Oh, I think you are.
Because if you don't--

462
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:03,300
I will divorce you.

463
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:06,400
Then I'll go to the police.

464
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,500
And tell them what?

465
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:12,535
That there's a secret bank account
on the Cayman Islands that no longer exists?

466
00:30:14,135 --> 00:30:18,135
You moved the money?
- Of course I moved the money.

467
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:23,635
But-- that was risky!
The Feds are watching you right now.

468
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:28,335
I had to do something.
Couldn't let you make a fool out of me.

469
00:30:38,635 --> 00:30:42,600
Stop, Carlos! Stop it! Put me down!
- OK.

470
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,500
Put me down--

471
00:30:44,535 --> 00:30:47,200
Let me go!

472
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:51,235
Stop! You're hurting me, Carlos!

473
00:30:53,535 --> 00:30:56,900
Sign it.

474
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:00,935
SIGN IT!

475
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:12,800
I know, baby.

476
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:16,835
It hurts to lose.

477
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:46,200
Mr and Ms Van de Kamp?

478
00:31:46,235 --> 00:31:48,800
Uh, yes. Is it our turn?

479
00:31:48,835 --> 00:31:52,400
Well, uh-- sort of.
Andrew's waiting inside, but--

480
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:53,600
What's wrong?

481
00:31:53,635 --> 00:31:57,200
He said he won't go forward
with the session if--

482
00:31:57,235 --> 00:32:01,200
his mother is about.
He only wants to talk to his dad.

483
00:32:01,235 --> 00:32:04,800
We drove 200 miles to be here today.
This is unacceptable.

484
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:07,900
I share your frustration.

485
00:32:07,935 --> 00:32:10,400
To hell with him then.
We're going home.

486
00:32:10,435 --> 00:32:13,000
No.
- I won't let him insult you like this!

487
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:17,035
He blames me for his being here.
He blames me for everything.

488
00:32:18,135 --> 00:32:19,300
And he's probably right.

489
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:22,900
Any mistakes made
were made by both of us.

490
00:32:22,935 --> 00:32:26,000
One of us should go talk to him,
see how he is.

491
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:29,500
I'm OK.

492
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:33,535
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

493
00:32:35,235 --> 00:32:39,235
Right this way.

494
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,400
Mom! Mom!!
- I'm coming.

495
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:12,435
What is it?
Why aren't you guys brushing your teeth?

496
00:33:12,935 --> 00:33:14,100
Parker, what happened?

497
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:17,400
Porter pushed me and it fell in!
- He pushed me first!

498
00:33:17,435 --> 00:33:19,600
Can I flush it?

499
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:21,200
No, I'll fish it out later.

500
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:25,235
You're off the hook for tonight.
But not you two, so start brushing.

501
00:33:27,235 --> 00:33:31,235
Preston, did you not hear me?
Start brushing your teeth!

502
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:34,300
What are you doing?

503
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:37,400
Don't You Dare.

504
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,400
Do it! Do it! Do it!

505
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,200
Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Preston, don't listen to them.

506
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:44,235
Back away from the toilet,
and no one gets hurt.

507
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:48,435
I mean it this time!
These are not just words!

508
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,600
If you do this, so help me--

509
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:55,300
<i>Hearing the hollowness of her own voice,

510
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:59,335
<i>Lynette realized that it was time
to get one step ahead.

511
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:05,535
I will walk you over to Mrs Van de Kamp's,
and we all know what happens when she gets mad.

512
00:34:10,235 --> 00:34:14,235
Now go brush your teeth,
and I want them to sparkle! Go on!

513
00:34:18,335 --> 00:34:21,900
Sorry you had to bring your kid back.
What happened this time?

514
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,935
Well, a couple of months back
I caught Ty going through my purse.

515
00:34:26,435 --> 00:34:30,300
Hard bacon have you got.
Was he looking for real money?

516
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:32,900
Who knows at this point.

517
00:34:32,935 --> 00:34:36,700
Anyway, I knocked a couple back
and things got heated,

518
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:40,700
pretty soon we're both screaming,
throwing stuff around the apartment--

519
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:43,500
Next thing you know, the lady upstairs
calls the cops on us.

520
00:34:43,535 --> 00:34:47,535
Aw, gimme a break.

521
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:53,035
So now I got some social worker
trying to tell me how to raise my boy.

522
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,635
Kids. If I knew then what I know now,
I'd have had that hysterectomy 20 years ago.

523
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,800
Bree--
- Don't get up. I'll be quick.

524
00:35:14,835 --> 00:35:18,835
Andrew. All any parent can do is try to provide
their child with the tools to succeed in life.

525
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:24,100
Education, love, a good clean safe home.

526
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:27,300
I have given you those things,
and I am through feeling guilty.

527
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:30,500
So if you want to piss your life away
and blame it on how horrible things are, go ahead.

528
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:34,535
But I want it stated for the record
that I am a good mother.

529
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:38,635
Did you hear me?
I -- am a good -- mother.

530
00:35:40,535 --> 00:35:43,300
Bree.

531
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:45,600
Andrew just told me
he thinks

532
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:49,300
he might be gay.

533
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:50,034
What?

534
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:53,000
That's why he wanted me to come in first.

535
00:35:53,035 --> 00:35:57,035
He thought I could take it better.

536
00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:05,835
Well, that's right.
I will be waiting in the car.

537
00:36:13,635 --> 00:36:17,635
Mrs Solís!
Where are you going to?

538
00:36:21,735 --> 00:36:21,934
OK--

539
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:25,400
Are your roommates here?
- No.

540
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:28,700
Are you OK?
- Yeah.

541
00:36:28,735 --> 00:36:31,300
What's this?
- That-- uh--

542
00:36:31,335 --> 00:36:33,200
Carlos just got a little rough.

543
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:34,600
Made me sign some paper.

544
00:36:34,635 --> 00:36:38,635
Did he hurt you?

545
00:36:39,735 --> 00:36:41,200
John, what are you doing?

546
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:42,200
I'll take care of this.

547
00:36:42,235 --> 00:36:43,100
You won't do anything.

548
00:36:43,135 --> 00:36:45,000
We won't let him get away with this.

549
00:36:45,035 --> 00:36:47,900
You really want to get back on him?
Then kiss me.

550
00:36:47,935 --> 00:36:50,400
How's that gonna help?
- Does.

551
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:54,435
One day, when the time is right, I'll tell him
how he drove me right into your arms.

552
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:59,335
And that will kill him.

553
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:05,735
And tonight-- whatever you do,
don't call me beautiful.

554
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,900
Oh Morty, look who's here!

555
00:37:19,935 --> 00:37:22,600
Hey Molly, hi.

556
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:25,100
Suzie, what brings you here?

557
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:29,135
Mom.
She's right over there.

558
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:32,400
What's she doing out there?

559
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:35,800
She says she won't come in
until you go out and apologize.

560
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:37,600
But for what?

561
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,400
For shoving her.

562
00:37:39,435 --> 00:37:42,500
I only shoved her
'cause she wouldn't stop hitting me.

563
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:44,700
Why was she hitting you?

564
00:37:44,735 --> 00:37:47,400
I threw-- threw a book at her.

565
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:49,500
Morty!
- It was a paperback!

566
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:52,900
Even so!
- At least I missed.

567
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:56,500
And she-- she hit me square in the gut.

568
00:37:56,535 --> 00:38:00,500
Wanna see the bruise?
- That's OK.

569
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:04,535
It really hurt.
- I understand.

570
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:09,035
So-- could you just go out
and apologize?

571
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,500
No.
- Why?

572
00:38:12,535 --> 00:38:13,700
'Cause I don't want her back.

573
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:16,700
Morty?
- Look, I'd love her. But--

574
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:20,400
the pancake shack
is just starting to take off.

575
00:38:20,435 --> 00:38:24,435
We're talking about hooking in another one.
That's practically a chain.

576
00:38:25,535 --> 00:38:28,300
I don't have time for her hysterics.

577
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:32,200
I sympathize, I really do.
But you have to take her back.

578
00:38:32,235 --> 00:38:36,235
Why?
- Because she wants to move in with me.

579
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:37,700
Oh.

580
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:41,700
Morty, I'd like to have a relationship again,
and at my age, with the kid--

581
00:38:41,735 --> 00:38:45,300
If she moves into my house,
even for a couple of years, I'm doomed.

582
00:38:45,335 --> 00:38:48,900
Wasn't there a plum--
Your mother said you're in love with a plumber.

583
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:51,600
I am.
I mean, I was.

584
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:55,635
It didn't work out.
- I'm sorry.

585
00:38:56,035 --> 00:39:00,035
And she will burn up all my oxygen,
and I need it.

586
00:39:00,735 --> 00:39:02,800
Please, can't you give her another chance?

587
00:39:02,835 --> 00:39:04,800
You guys are really good together.

588
00:39:04,835 --> 00:39:08,700
You know, when--
when there's no violence.

589
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:12,735
We do have chemistry.
- Absolutely.

590
00:39:12,935 --> 00:39:16,935
And the sex was like-- wow.

591
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:20,100
There was this one time we were
coming home on the Interstate--

592
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:24,135
You don't have to sell me.
Just go talk to her.

593
00:39:24,835 --> 00:39:28,835
Now.

594
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:33,635
OK.

595
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:43,400
That was a mighty big sigh.

596
00:39:43,435 --> 00:39:46,400
I just keep thinking it's coming nearer
and I can't stop it.   - What?

597
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:50,435
The day my mother will need to
move in with me, and I won't have a choice.

598
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:52,700
Mhm.
- You know, it's years away.

599
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:56,735
She's youthful and vibrant, thank god.
But time flies.

600
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:01,000
One day, she won't be able to
take care of herself anymore

601
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:05,035
and I have to step up.
- I suppose that's true.

602
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:09,835
It's nature's little joke that children
ultimately end up parenting their parents.

603
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:14,500
When that day comes,
I'll be ready.

604
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:18,535
Honey, you better get out there.

605
00:40:56,435 --> 00:41:00,435
Hey.

606
00:41:01,435 --> 00:41:05,435
I just wanted to apologize.
- Lynette. Don't.

607
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:11,200
The fact that you just crossed that street
means the world to me.

608
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:15,000
And if anyone here should apologize,
it's me.

609
00:41:15,035 --> 00:41:19,035
Thank you.

610
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:25,935
Looks like Tom's got the mob under control.
You want to have some coffee?

611
00:41:26,335 --> 00:41:30,335
Sit around-- bitch about that case--

612
00:41:30,835 --> 00:41:34,835
I would love to.
- OK.

613
00:41:39,735 --> 00:41:43,735
<i>Children come into the world
with their own agendas.

614
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:48,235
<i>Some, to brighten our days.

615
00:41:48,935 --> 00:41:52,935
<i>Some, to test our patience.

616
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:59,835
<i>Some, to give us purpose.

617
00:42:04,035 --> 00:42:08,035
<i>Some, to take care of us.

618
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:15,735
<i>Yes, when they come,
children change everything.

619
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,600
<i>Especially
when they're not invited.
