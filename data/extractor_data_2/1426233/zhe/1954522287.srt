What?

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,460
********
在不违反"我不得批评你的工作"
协议之下 我无法做出评价

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,630
Then what was "Oh, boy"?
那干吗说"好家伙的"?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,660
Great restraint on my part.
已经是极度的克制了

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,800
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say, "Science."

You actually had it
right in the first place.

For the next 840 minutes, I'm
effectively one of Heisenberg's particles;
在接下来的840分钟里
我就是海森堡的一颗微粒
(德国物理学家 量子力学创始人之一)

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,180
I know where I am or I know how fast
I'm going, but I can't know both.
我要么只知道自己在哪儿
要么只知道自己有多快

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,060
Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this
huge annoying thing hovering over my head?
这么件烦人的事儿在我脑海盘旋
我这要怎么活下去?

his wife, their sullen teenage daughter.
你 校长 他妻子

time it is and whether people know it.
他们一家子都像着了魔似的

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,380
You went to President Seibert's
house in the middle of the nig?
你大半夜的跑到Seibert校长家去了?

He didn't respond to my e-mail,
his phone number is unlisted.

基金会的拨款提议吗?

38
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,820
to detect slow-moving monopoles
at the magnetic North Pole?

Hardly a day goes by when
I don't think about it.

Of course not. I'm a
theoretical physict.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,520
A career I chose in no small
part because it's indoors,
我选择这个职业主要是因为
它是室内工作

49
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,900
but if I'm able to detect
slow-moving magnetic monopoles there,
要是我能去北极探测

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,690
I will be the scientis
to confirm string theory.

People will write books about me.

Third-graders will create macaroni-art
dioramas depicting scenes from my life.
三年级的小盆友们会用通心粉

trying to pummel you to death.

I'm on the horns of a dilemma.

Cooper, at the North Pole?

How can I possibly go?

Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to
end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?
Sheldon 我要说什么你才肯罢休
放我回去睡觉哇?

Odd, President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

- How was it resolved?
- It wasn't.

and rendered the question moot.
他妻子把他们家的狗放了出来
导致这个问题最终悬而未决

have an entire summer without Sheldon.

Yes.
是的

85
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,330
Is this just so we won't touch
your stuff while you're away?
是为了防止你不在时 我们碰你东西?

86
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,230
I'll admit that was a concern.
我承认这是顾虑之一

But the fact is, I'll
need a support team.

- 你们仨则是我的首选

Well, there are others who
might be more qualified,

but the thought of interviewing
them gave me a stomachache.

few moments discuss it?
你们几个何不花点时间商量一下?

the North Pole with him, are we?

I'm still within earshot!

don't want to go on an NSF expedition,"
好办啊 不要说"不 我们不想
参加国科会的科考队"

101
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,150
say, "No, we don't want to spend "three months stuck
in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag."
要说"不 我们不想和疯子
在极地小屋待三个月"

102
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,400
But if we were part of the team
that confirmed string theory,

108
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,720
You still might get on a magazine.

in this life we are rewarded in the next.

and I'm reborn as a well-hung
billionaire with wings!
我就能转世投胎成一个

the expedition's team leader,
很好 告诉你们哈

Let me see if I
understand this correctly.
看看我理解的对不

264
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,410
Her missing you is an emotional
state you find desirable?
她对你的想念之情是你所希望的吧?

265
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,230
- Yes, obviously.
- All right.
- 对 显然
- 好吧

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,380
Well, given that missing you
is predicated on you leaving,
那么 既然思念是要以你离开为前提

267
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,690
logic dictates you must leave.

Yes, okay, but I'm gonna
be gone for three months.

269
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,870
What if she doesn't miss me that
long and she meets someone else?
如果她不能想念我这么长时间
她遇到了别人呢?

She does have a short attention span.

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,430
- So, I can't .
- Leonard, you may be right.
- 所以 我不能走
- Leonard 也许你是对的

272
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:22,160
It appears that Penny secretly wants you in
her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion.
看起来Penny内心希望你是她生活一部分
非常亲密又有肉体接触的那种

273
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:24,030
You really think so?

Of course not.
当然不是

275
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,870
Even in my sleep-deprived state, I've managed
to pull off another one of my classic pranks.

Oh, Leonard, what time is it?

What did you mean when you
said you're going to miss me?

You'll be gone and I'll notice.

this? What does this mean?
好吧 那么 这个是怎么回事?

Wine, credit card and late night
television are a bad combination.
我想是酒精作用 信用卡账单和
深夜电视混在一起的"杰作"?

All right, fine. What about that
really long hug? What did that mean?

That wasn't a long hug.

288
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,550
It was at least five Mississippis.

289
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,920
A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.

Leonard, I don't know what to
tell you. It was just a hug.
