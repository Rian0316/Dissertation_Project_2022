1
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,036
We can't economise in accommodation?

2
00:00:48,207 --> 00:00:50,323
(WOMAN) 'Fraid not, Minister.

3
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:54,638
- Data-processing equipment?
- Not possible.

4
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:59,198
- The further education budget?
- Sadly, it can't be.

5
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:03,957
At least the universities won't cost us as much,

6
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:08,006
with overseas students paying fees
covering education costs.

7
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:12,922
- Unless you make exceptions...?
- No, sorry, no exceptions.

8
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,998
At least, that's one saving.

9
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,842
- Minister, it's...
- Yes, of course.

10
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:21,601
That's all, I'm afraid. Meeting over.

11
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:24,122
- Thank you
- Thank you.

12
00:01:24,287 --> 00:01:26,198
Before Sir Humphrey comes,

13
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:31,076
Number 10 asked you to approve
recommendations for the honours list.

14
00:01:31,247 --> 00:01:33,681
That's the eighth time you've asked.

15
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:37,077
Are honours the most serious
concern of this department?

16
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:41,957
They are to the people on the list.
Some haven't slept for days!

17
00:01:42,126 --> 00:01:46,358
What are they worried about?
Ministers never veto honours.

18
00:01:46,527 --> 00:01:50,122
It's possible.
They're worried about the delay.

19
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:54,279
How do people know they're listed?
It's marked "Strictly Confidential".

20
00:01:54,446 --> 00:01:56,199
Oh, Minister...

21
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,605
Silly of me.

22
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:03,726
If they'd put some of that effort
into cutting expenditure...

23
00:02:03,886 --> 00:02:07,003
How can I make people want economies

24
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,761
in the same way they want OBEs and KCBs?

25
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:14,442
I've been thinking... No, no, no.

26
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:17,246
- What?
- No, no, nothing...

27
00:02:17,967 --> 00:02:19,365
Spit it out.

28
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:24,482
It's not my place, and I couldn't
possibly recommend it...

29
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:28,765
Suppose you were to refuse
to recommend any honours

30
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:33,921
for civil servants who hadn't cut
their budgets by 5%...?

31
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,924
- Bernard!
- Sorry, Minister...

32
00:02:38,086 --> 00:02:41,203
No, Bernard! It's brilliant!

33
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:47,123
It's the answer. It's the only hold
we have over the civil servants.

34
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:50,757
I can't stop their pay rises or their promotions.

35
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:55,442
I don't even write their reports,
but I can withhold their honours!

36
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,883
- Well done.
- You thought of it, Minister.

37
00:02:59,047 --> 00:03:03,278
- No, no, you thought of it.
- No, you thought of it.

38
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:06,635
Please!

39
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:13,086
Just a touch, please. Thank you very much.

40
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:17,160
Splendid dinner. I always enjoy my visits here.

41
00:03:17,326 --> 00:03:20,557
I'm afraid this could be your last.

42
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:24,515
Why? Did I pass the port the wrong way?

43
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:28,520
- Tell him, Bursar.
- The college's going to the wall.

44
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:34,125
It's your new policy of charging
overseas students full rates.

45
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,596
Other Oxford colleges can cope,

46
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:41,521
but we've always had many
overseas students here at Baillie.

47
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:45,236
You simply charge them a full fee, no problem.

48
00:03:45,406 --> 00:03:49,319
Unless they can't pay £4,000 a year.
They won't come.

49
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:55,800
I've been all over the USA, selling
them the idea of an Oxford education.

50
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,878
Africa is crawling with British professors

51
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:03,676
frantically trying to flog
sociology courses to the natives.

52
00:04:03,846 --> 00:04:08,078
And India and the Middle East.
Competition is cut-throat.

53
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:12,558
Why not fill up vacancies
with British undergraduates?

54
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,877
I don't think that's awfully funny, Humphrey.

55
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:22,035
- I wasn't trying to be funny.
- Anything but home students!

56
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:27,565
- Why?
- We only get 500 a head for them.

57
00:04:27,727 --> 00:04:32,481
We'd have to take 400
to replace a mere 50 foreigners.

58
00:04:32,646 --> 00:04:37,117
The staff/student ratio would go from 1:10 to 1:34.

59
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:42,565
We'd have classrooms, dormitories...
like Wormwood Scrubs!

60
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,119
Or the University of Sussex!

61
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:54,246
The Master thinks the pictures
may fetch £20-30,000.

62
00:04:54,407 --> 00:04:56,715
The pictures and silver together

63
00:04:56,887 --> 00:05:00,277
might just pay the mortgage interest.

64
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:03,041
Dear, oh, dear!

65
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:07,722
Or we could get the Government
to treat us as an exception.

66
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,559
Interestingly, Humphrey,

67
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:15,880
it seems to be your Minister
who has the authority.

68
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:25,280
How might one persuade a Minister
of the importance of Baillie College?

69
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:29,565
Why not get him down to a High Table dinner?

70
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:34,675
Is he of the intellectual calibre
to understand our case?

71
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,797
Oh, yes!

72
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,518
It's intelligible to anyone

73
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:44,804
with the intellectual calibre of Winnie the Pooh!

74
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,764
Quite!

75
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:51,920
And Hacker is of the intellectual
calibre of Winnie the Pooh?

76
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,164
Oh, yes!

77
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:58,077
On his day.

78
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,635
- Morning, Minister.
- Morning, Humphrey.

79
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:05,603
Two things, Minister.

80
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:11,204
Firstly, the departmental
recommendations for the honours list.

81
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,563
- The honours list again!
- Yes, Minister.

82
00:06:14,726 --> 00:06:19,322
- Let's leave that for the moment.
- We can't leave it, Minister.

83
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:22,797
- It's getting near the five weeks.
- Five weeks?

84
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,925
All recipients are notified five weeks before.

85
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,157
It gives them time to refuse.

86
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:31,922
When did a civil servant last refuse an honour?!

87
00:06:32,086 --> 00:06:34,840
Somebody in the Treasury refused a knighthood.

88
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,443
- When?
- I think it was 1496.

89
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,204
- Why?
- He'd already got one.

90
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,597
- If you've approved the list...
- Humphrey...

91
00:06:45,766 --> 00:06:49,077
...did you know that 20%
of honours go to civil servants?

92
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,045
A fitting tribute to their devotion to duty.

93
00:06:52,206 --> 00:06:54,277
That's what they get paid for.

94
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:58,326
The rest of us have to do
something special to get an honour.

95
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:03,356
They work for years with the mentally
handicapped to get an MBE.

96
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:06,757
Your knighthoods simply come up with the rations.

97
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,760
Minister, her Majesty's
civil servants spend their lives

98
00:07:10,927 --> 00:07:16,364
working for a modest wage
and at the end retire into obscurity.

99
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:20,485
Honours are a small reward for a lifetime of loyal,

100
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:25,880
self-effacing discretion
and devoted service to the nation.

101
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,402
- "A modest wage"?
- Alas, yes.

102
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,876
You get over £30,000 a year!

103
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:36,757
- That's £7,000 more than I get.
- But still relatively modest.

104
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:39,804
Relative to whom?

105
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,322
Elizabeth Taylor, for example.

106
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,686
You are not relative to Elizabeth Taylor.

107
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:48,800
There are important differences.

108
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,596
Indeed, yes. She didn't get a first at Oxford.

109
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:54,802
And retire into obscurity?!

110
00:07:54,967 --> 00:08:00,086
You take a massive pension
and become directors of oil companies.

111
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,282
But very obscure directors.

112
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:06,759
You're in no danger of the sack.
In industry, you get the boot.

113
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:10,077
In the civil service,
if you screw up, I get the boot!

114
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:13,922
- Very droll, Minister. The list...
- No, Humphrey.

115
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:18,443
I'll not approve any honour
to any civil servant who hasn't earned it.

116
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:22,643
- What do you mean, "earned it"?
- I mean "earned it".

117
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:27,641
- Done something to deserve it.
- But that's unheard of!

118
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:33,195
My new policy is to withhold
all honours from civil servants

119
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:38,918
who do not make a cut
in their budgets of 5% per year.

120
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:43,155
Your silence indicates approval?

121
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:47,286
It does not! Where did you get
that preposterous idea?

122
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:49,440
It...

123
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:57,721
...just came to me.
- It's ridiculous! Unheard of!

124
00:08:57,887 --> 00:09:00,447
The whole idea is... It's...

125
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,643
It strikes at the very roots of...

126
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:06,400
It's the beginning of the end!

127
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:10,798
The thin end of the wedge! A Bennite solution!

128
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,561
What next? Abolition of the monarchy?

129
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:15,364
Don't be absurd.

130
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:18,802
The system has worked so well in the past.

131
00:09:18,967 --> 00:09:20,286
It hasn't.

132
00:09:20,447 --> 00:09:24,679
- Give it a fair trial.
- I thought you might say that...

133
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:31,605
The Most Noble Order of the Garter
was founded in 1348 by Edward III.

134
00:09:31,766 --> 00:09:34,679
It's at the end of its trial period now.

135
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:39,601
Minister, if you block honours pending economies,

136
00:09:39,766 --> 00:09:43,237
you might create a dangerous precedent.

137
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:48,561
If we do the right thing now,
we'll have to do the right thing next time?

138
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:51,958
- Nothing would get done at all!
- On the contrary.

139
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:56,324
- Many things must be done, but...
...nothing done for the first time!

140
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:57,806
No, Minister!

141
00:09:57,967 --> 00:10:03,757
I'm fully seized of your aims,
and I'll try to put them into practice.

142
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,246
To that end,

143
00:10:05,407 --> 00:10:09,559
I recommend we set up a committee
with broad terms of reference,

144
00:10:09,726 --> 00:10:13,561
so we're in a position to think
through the various implications

145
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:16,878
and decide based on long-term considerations

146
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:21,119
rather than rush prematurely
into precipitate and ill-conceived actions

147
00:10:21,286 --> 00:10:25,074
which might have unforeseen repercussions.

148
00:10:26,007 --> 00:10:28,646
You mean "no"?

149
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:33,641
I mean, as far as one can see,
in the fullness of time...

150
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,480
No, no, no, Humphrey.

151
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:38,797
You know me: Action now!

152
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,561
(MUTTERS) Action now.

153
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:44,719
Nobody in their right mind can want honours.

154
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:48,003
They encourage sycophancy, snobbery, jealousy,

155
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,204
and civil servants shouldn't get them all!

156
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:55,804
- But Minister...
- No, no! I'm sorry. I have decided.

157
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:58,800
- Your other point?
- Other point?

158
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:01,800
- You had two.
- Did I?

159
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:05,561
Yes, I'm sorry. The shock!

160
00:11:06,246 --> 00:11:11,923
Yesterday, I had representations
from Baillie College, Oxford.

161
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:17,559
Grants for overseas students...
They'll lose millions a year.

162
00:11:17,726 --> 00:11:20,878
They must just take more British students.

163
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,800
Nothing would please them more, but you see...

164
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,844
...Baillie has many foreign students,

165
00:11:28,007 --> 00:11:30,077
and there could be repercussions

166
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:33,717
at the schools of tropical medicine,
international law,

167
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:37,003
and the Arabic department
may have to close down.

168
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:40,762
We can't educate foreigners
at the taxpayer's expense.

169
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,679
Not just foreigners.

170
00:11:42,847 --> 00:11:48,284
If the diplomatic service had nowhere
to immerse its recruits,

171
00:11:48,447 --> 00:11:53,282
the results could be catastrophic,
with a pro-Israeli Foreign Office!

172
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,606
What would happen to our oil policy?

173
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:59,485
Its recruits must go elsewhere.

174
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:02,081
Where else would they learn Arabic?

175
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:04,282
Arabia?

176
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:07,119
Baillie College has an outstanding record.

177
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:10,835
- It's filled our jails for years.
- Jails?

178
00:12:11,007 --> 00:12:14,840
Yes. The letters "JB" are the finest
honour in the Commonwealth.

179
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:18,601
- "JB"?
- "Jailed by the British".

180
00:12:18,766 --> 00:12:21,679
Gandhi, Nkrumah, Makarios,

181
00:12:21,847 --> 00:12:25,840
Ben-Gurion, Kenyatta, Nehru, Mugabe.

182
00:12:26,007 --> 00:12:31,081
The list of leaders is endless
and contains several of our students.

183
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:33,202
"Our students"?

184
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:37,405
Humphrey... which college did you go to?

185
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:39,956
That is quite beside the point.

186
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,119
I like being beside the point.

187
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:46,802
Humour me, Humphrey.
Which college did you go to?

188
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:50,675
Was it Baillie, by any strange coincidence?

189
00:12:50,847 --> 00:12:56,398
It so happens... I am a Baillie man,
but that has nothing to do with it!

190
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,398
No, of course not.

191
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:00,797
Perish the thought. Naughty.

192
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:03,961
Yes? The division, Minister.

193
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:07,436
That rather settles it. No more time.

194
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,074
Am I voting "aye" or "no"?

195
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:13,523
- "No". It's a...
- I don't want to know what it is.

196
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:17,679
I don't want to go through the wrong door.

197
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,958
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

198
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,246
Arnold?

199
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,001
Humphrey! Do sit down.

200
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:34,204
Hope you don't mind my dragging you here.

201
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:38,996
- No, please.
- I was worried about your Minister.

202
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:42,480
Linking honours to economies.

203
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:45,161
That? A lot of nonsense.

204
00:13:45,327 --> 00:13:48,717
Good. You mean it's not true?

205
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:55,166
Not exactly. That is, he did just mention it.

206
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:59,442
- But...
- But what?

207
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,838
I can't find any effective arguments against it.

208
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:06,800
- It's the thin end of the wedge.
- That's what I said.

209
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,800
- A Bennite solution.
- I said that.

210
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:12,527
- Where will it end?
- That's what I said.

211
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:16,715
No, it's intolerable, but...

212
00:14:18,286 --> 00:14:19,958
...irresistible.

213
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:24,405
I'm not reprimanding you,
I don't know the facts well enough.

214
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:28,958
I'd like your assurance
that he won't be putting it into practice.

215
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:31,197
I certainly hope he won't.

216
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,483
I'm not sure that hopes are good enough.

217
00:14:34,646 --> 00:14:39,402
If he applied it to your department,
the contagion would spread!

218
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,284
Every department!

219
00:14:42,086 --> 00:14:47,480
- Presumably, we can count on you?
- I shall certainly try.

220
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:54,516
- But... it's rather tricky.
- You know what you're doing.

221
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,476
This could cause people
to reflect on your soundness.

222
00:14:59,646 --> 00:15:02,605
I've no doubts about you myself, but...

223
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:07,282
- I thought a chat would be useful.
- Absolutely. Thank you.

224
00:15:07,447 --> 00:15:11,644
By the way, I had our college
master on the phone.

225
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:14,798
- He said you dined at Baillie.
- Right!

226
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:20,077
I assured them your Minister would
treat them as a special case.

227
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,561
Yes... Yes...

228
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:28,686
I've got the Minister coming
to a benefactors' dinner.

229
00:15:28,847 --> 00:15:31,202
Good. Sound man.

230
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:36,121
I must be getting over to Number 10.
Thanks for dropping in.

231
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,606
Pleasure...

232
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,358
...Arnold.

233
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:51,282
Sir Humphrey saw the Cabinet Secretary
and got the most frightful wigging.

234
00:15:51,447 --> 00:15:56,362
Really tore him off a strip because
of your economies-honours scheme.

235
00:15:56,527 --> 00:16:00,804
- Your scheme.
- We've been through all that.

236
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,356
Sorry. My scheme.

237
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,000
Why wig someone as high up as Humphrey?

238
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:10,842
Normally, it's civilised,
but this time it was no-holds-barred.

239
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,556
Sir Arnold said he wasn't
actually reprimanding him.

240
00:16:14,726 --> 00:16:17,525
- Bad as that, was it?
- Yes.

241
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:22,556
He suggested some people
might not think he was sound.

242
00:16:22,726 --> 00:16:25,081
- A real punch-up!
- Indeed.

243
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:29,684
What has Sir Arnold to fear?
He has all the honours he could want.

244
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:32,280
- He has his "G".
- "G"?

245
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:36,280
- You get your "G" after your "K".
- You speak in riddles.

246
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:40,679
First you get the CMG,
then the KCMG and the GCMG,

247
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:44,362
the Command of the Order
of St Michael and St George,

248
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,802
Knight Grand Cross of St George.

249
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:51,403
In the service, CMG stands for "Call Me God".

250
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:55,355
And KCMG for "Kindly Call Me God".

251
00:16:56,806 --> 00:16:58,445
And GCMG?

252
00:16:58,606 --> 00:17:01,599
"God Calls Me God".

253
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:06,679
Why should Sir Arnold worry?
He has his full quota of honours.

254
00:17:06,847 --> 00:17:08,166
Nowhere near!

255
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:11,717
There's a peerage, the CH,
the OM, the Knight of the Thistle...

256
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:14,161
Knight of the Thistle? Who for?

257
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:18,764
- Scotsmen and donkeys?!
- There's a distinction.

258
00:17:18,927 --> 00:17:22,362
You haven't met the Scottish Nationalists!

259
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:27,521
- How do they award the Thistle?
- A committee sits on it.

260
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:35,362
Does Humphrey think I'll change university policy

261
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:37,438
over High Table dinner?

262
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:41,599
I believe Baillie College give
a very good dinner, Minister.

263
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:47,041
- How much further?
- A few minutes. The M40's good.

264
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:51,521
So's the M4...

265
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:55,235
Why did we get two really good roads to Oxford

266
00:17:55,407 --> 00:18:01,242
before any to Southampton
or Dover or any of the ports?

267
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:05,445
Nearly all our Permanent Secretaries
went to Oxford, Minister,

268
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:10,282
and most Oxford colleges give very good dinners.

269
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:13,405
- The Cabinet allow that?
- Certainly not.

270
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:16,956
They said no motorway to take
civil servants to Oxford,

271
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:20,675
unless there was one to take
Ministers hunting in the shires.

272
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:24,965
That's why the M1 stopped in Leicestershire!

273
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:27,686
Oh, come!

274
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:33,402
What about the M11 just completed?

275
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:36,081
Doesn't Cambridge give as good dinners?

276
00:18:36,246 --> 00:18:38,806
Yes, of course, but it's been years

277
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:43,722
since Transport had a Permanent
Secretary from Cambridge.

278
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,364
(CHATTER)

279
00:18:57,086 --> 00:19:01,159
For a college on the edge
of bankruptcy, not a bad dinner!

280
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:04,682
The Fitzwalter Dinner is paid for by endowment,

281
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:07,644
a great 16th-century benefactor.

282
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:12,835
Most nights we eat Mother's Pride
and processed cheese.

283
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:16,362
You need a 20th-century benefactor.

284
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:20,963
- Interesting you should say that.
- Why?

285
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:23,481
Benefactors are few and far between.

286
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:28,322
Isaac Wolfson is only the second man
to have a college named after him

287
00:19:28,487 --> 00:19:31,047
- at Oxford and Cambridge.
- Who's the first?

288
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:33,083
Jesus.

289
00:19:33,246 --> 00:19:36,159
- Jesus?
- Jesus... Christ.

290
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:41,485
Some of our most revered benefactors are men

291
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:45,161
who saved the college
from the depredations of Government.

292
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,842
Their names are remembered
and hallowed for centuries.

293
00:19:49,007 --> 00:19:52,601
- It's a sort of immortality.
- Really?

294
00:19:52,766 --> 00:19:55,519
What did these benefactors do?

295
00:19:55,686 --> 00:20:00,317
Take Sir William de Vere, his coat
of arms are there and in chapel.

296
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:04,958
He diverted the baronial army
away from Baillie in the 15th century.

297
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:09,085
He had the soldiers billetted
at St George's College.

298
00:20:09,246 --> 00:20:14,719
- I didn't know there was a St George's.
- There isn't. Not since that.

299
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:20,119
Then, there's George Monkton,
whom Monkton Quad's named after.

300
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:24,485
He stopped Cromwell melting
all the college silver down

301
00:20:24,646 --> 00:20:26,398
to pay for his army.

302
00:20:26,606 --> 00:20:31,476
He told them the silver was better
quality at Trinity, Cambridge!

303
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:36,838
Now, it looks like there'll be
no college left to remember.

304
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:42,717
Unless we can solve
the problem of overseas students.

305
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,478
(MURMURS OF AGREEMENT)

306
00:20:44,646 --> 00:20:48,242
Well, of course, one would like to...

307
00:20:48,407 --> 00:20:49,965
...help oneself.

308
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,085
Er... help one's friends.

309
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,715
Help the college.

310
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:59,721
- Nothing to do with the honour.
- Of course not! Ignoble thought.

311
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:03,880
The Minister believes
it's a politician's duty to help others.

312
00:21:04,047 --> 00:21:06,686
(SLURRING)
Absolutely. Name of the game.

313
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:10,760
That's why we go into politics, to help others.

314
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,998
I'm an idealist, nothing to do with the honour.

315
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:18,556
Most of the honour comes after you're dead.

316
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:22,639
Not much satisfaction from having
your name on the silver sconce

317
00:21:22,806 --> 00:21:25,878
when you're six feet under!

318
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:32,677
Incidentally, Master,
to change the subject completely...

319
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:38,039
...when do you award
your honorary doctorates?

320
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:42,438
The ceremony's not for a few months,
but we have to decide in two weeks.

321
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:45,326
- Doctorate?
- Aren't they decided?

322
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,637
There is one Doctorate of Law still to be decided.

323
00:21:48,806 --> 00:21:53,516
We're wondering whether it should go
to a judge or someone in Government.

324
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:56,155
(SLURS) Judge?!

325
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:02,005
You don't want to make a judge a Doctor of Law!

326
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,954
The politicians make the laws and pass the laws.

327
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:10,358
If it wasn't for politicians,
the judges wouldn't be able to judge.

328
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:13,563
There'd be no laws to judge!

329
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:15,603
- Yes, indeed.
- Quite!

330
00:22:15,766 --> 00:22:19,442
They'd have nothing to do.
Queues of unemployed judges...

331
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,326
...in silly wigs!

332
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:26,476
It's all right for judges.

333
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:31,436
They don't have to suck up
to TV producers, lie to journalists.

334
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:35,394
They don't have to pretend
to like their Cabinet colleagues.

335
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:37,682
I'll tell you something else...

336
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:42,956
...if judges had to put up
with some of my colleagues,

337
00:22:43,126 --> 00:22:46,835
they'd bring capital punishment back tomorrow!

338
00:22:47,726 --> 00:22:49,364
Bloody good job, too!

339
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:51,960
I'll tell you another thing...

340
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:56,005
...I can't send him to prison.

341
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,282
Can't send him to prison.

342
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:04,760
If I were a judge, I could whiz
old Humpy off to the Scrubs.

343
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:08,643
Feet wouldn't touch. Clang bang!
See you in three years.

344
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:14,119
One third remission for good conduct.
I can't do that!

345
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,523
I have to listen to him.

346
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,405
Oh, God!

347
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:24,005
On and on and on!

348
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:28,956
Some of his sentences
are longer than Judge Jeffreys'!

349
00:23:29,126 --> 00:23:32,802
No, no, no. Politicians are much more deserving.

350
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,277
You don't want to give
your doctory honourates to judges.

351
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:38,677
Definitely not!

352
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:41,963
Beautifully argued, Minister.

353
00:23:42,126 --> 00:23:46,166
I see now... we shouldn't give it to a judge.

354
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:50,838
- You put the case most expertly.
- Almost like a Doctor of Law.

355
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:54,556
I can see you there now in the Sheldonian,

356
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:57,764
standing there in those magnificent crimson robes,

357
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:02,795
receiving your doctorate in front
of an assembly of eminent scholars.

358
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,481
(HUMPHREY) Wonderful.
(MASTER) Marvellous.

359
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:08,719
How funny you should say that.

360
00:24:08,887 --> 00:24:12,402
I was just thinking the same thing.

361
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:20,327
Morning, Minister. Morning, Bernard.

362
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,677
Most enjoyable dinner last night.

363
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:30,126
I wonder if we could have
a private chat. Forgive us, Bernard.

364
00:24:30,286 --> 00:24:33,164
Minister...

365
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:36,956
...the master of Baillie has asked me to enquire

366
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:41,119
whether you'd accept an honorary doctorate of law.

367
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,644
Me? Good heavens!

368
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:46,844
- It's... not an offer.
- No, of course not.

369
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:51,159
Of course, in view of your
well-known hostility to honours...

370
00:24:51,327 --> 00:24:54,478
Don't be silly. This is quite different.

371
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:56,557
Not entirely, Minister.

372
00:24:56,726 --> 00:25:01,721
It's a matter of accepting it
without doing anything to deserve it,

373
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:06,277
as you might put it
in your refreshingly blunt fashion.

374
00:25:06,447 --> 00:25:09,041
I'm a Cabinet Minister!

375
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:12,994
- Isn't that what you're paid for?
- Yes, but... No!

376
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,199
Yes, but...

377
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:20,282
I can't refuse a vote of confidence
in the Government, not just oneself.

378
00:25:20,447 --> 00:25:24,759
No, quite. As I say, it's not certain, it's...

379
00:25:27,407 --> 00:25:30,318
(HUMPHREY HUMS TO HIMSELF)

380
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,284
Humphrey, to change the subject completely,

381
00:25:33,447 --> 00:25:37,998
I'd like to do what I can for Baillie
in this overseas students business.

382
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,759
Oh, good!

383
00:25:39,927 --> 00:25:43,362
But wouldn't I need a pretext... a reason?

384
00:25:43,527 --> 00:25:45,438
No, Minister, no problem.

385
00:25:45,606 --> 00:25:49,565
The Palace has been under pressure
from certain African leaders.

386
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:51,797
We can't embarrass the Palace,

387
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:56,358
so we'll redesignate Baillie
as a Commonwealth Education Centre.

388
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:04,079
But where am I to find the money?
I'm set on 5% cuts across the board.

389
00:26:04,246 --> 00:26:07,398
If that's achieved, anything's possible.

390
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:11,275
- The committee are waiting.
- Very well, show them in.

391
00:26:11,447 --> 00:26:15,998
I suppose we could achieve the cuts
in this department,

392
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:21,320
if the absurd idea of linking
honours to cuts were to be shelved.

393
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,920
- I see.
- Yes...

394
00:26:28,407 --> 00:26:32,001
(HUMPHREY) Thank you, Bernard.
(HACKER) Morning.

395
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:35,876
Now, minutes of the previous meeting?

396
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:38,958
Matters arising: Accommodation.

397
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:40,764
Oh, yes!

398
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:46,320
I'm happy to be able to tell you
that we have found a 5% cut,

399
00:26:46,487 --> 00:26:48,876
by selling an office in High Wycombe.

400
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:50,878
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

401
00:26:51,047 --> 00:26:53,083
- Yes, very good.
- Yes.

402
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:54,646
Stationery acquisition?

403
00:26:54,806 --> 00:26:59,561
We've discovered a new stock control
system to reduce expenditure.

404
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:04,117
- By how much?
- About 5%, wasn't it?

405
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:07,565
Excellent! Parks and Forestry?

406
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:11,766
If we delay the new computers,
we can make a saving.

407
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,804
- By how much?
- Yes...?

408
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,434
- About 5%.
- Yes, about 5%.

409
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:19,996
- Really?
- That cuts data processing, too.

410
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,760
- By...?
- By...

411
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:25,315
By about 5%.

412
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:28,047
- This is most satisfying.
- Yes.

413
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:30,880
Incidentally, while I think of it,

414
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:36,679
have you finished with the list
for the honours secretary?

415
00:27:36,847 --> 00:27:39,679
Yes, Humphrey. No problem there.

416
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:42,235
Bernard will give it to you.

417
00:27:42,407 --> 00:27:46,115
- Thank you, Bernard.
- All right, Humphrey?

418
00:27:46,286 --> 00:27:49,039
Yes, Doctor... er, Minister.

419
