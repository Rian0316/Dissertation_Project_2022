00:00:04,814 --> 00:00:07,667
You guys. You guys will not
believe what just happened.

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:09,016
On my way here, a taxi

3
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,318
jumped the curb
and it pinned this old lady,

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,687
and I-I just went into this,
like, crazy adrenaline mode

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,239
and I somehow lifted it off her.

6
00:00:15,241 --> 00:00:16,857
Oh, my God, Ted,
your wrist.

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,475
Oh, yeah, I guess
it's a little swollen.

8
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,244
I must've strained it lifting.
No,

9
00:00:20,246 --> 00:00:21,829
I believe our dear
friend Lily was referring

10
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,030
to your other wrist.

11
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,082
The one wearing the
male birth control.

12
00:00:25,084 --> 00:00:26,350
ROBIN:
I was gonna go with

13
00:00:26,352 --> 00:00:27,418
"chastity bracelet."

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,820
God, is it possible
to love you more?

15
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:31,255
TED: Really?
Really? I just

16
00:00:31,257 --> 00:00:33,340
saved someone's life, and
you guys are focusing on this?

17
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,042
Yeah, you know what,
guys? Leave him alone.

18
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,210
All right,
he's a hero.

19
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:37,344
Thank you.

20
00:00:37,346 --> 00:00:39,830
Do you think that your
super strength came from

21
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:41,382
wearing Wonder Woman's
magic wrist cuff?

22
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:43,133
(laughter)

23
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:45,168
Yeah, I'll have you know
that because of this cuff,

24
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,637
I have a date.

25
00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:47,888
With some hand lotion
and the Internet?

26
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,307
It is possible
to love you more!

27
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,010
She exists.

28
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,479
And she's right outside.

29
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,363
Great. Bring her in.

30
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,731
You know what? It's so nice out.

31
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,733
Why don't... why don't
we just all go for a walk.

32
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,785
It's pouring rain, Ted.
I think it's pretty obvious

33
00:01:01,787 --> 00:01:03,404
she can't fit through the door.
Mm.

34
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,472
She is a gorgeous,
athletic woman.

35
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,908
"Athletic"?
Sideburns, no cans.

36
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,093
She is hot.

37
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,028
So why can't
she come in, Ted?

38
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,914
She can come in.

39
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,250
(quietly):
In six and a half months.

40
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:18,202
Wait.
Are you saying she's...

41
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:19,236
Twenty.

42
00:01:19,238 --> 00:01:20,337
And a half.

43
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:21,538
(clears throat)
Almost.

Ah-ah! Hold up, guys.

47
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:43,610
She had to bounce. Um,
a flash mob broke out in front

48
00:01:43,612 --> 00:01:46,363
of a line of Korean-Mexican
food trucks in Williamsburg.

49
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:47,397
The only thing

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,016
that would make her
more of a 20-year-old

51
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:50,617
is an ironic form

52
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,669
of transportation.
BARNEY: Yeah.

53
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:52,853
She's roller skating there.

54
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:53,837
(laughs)

55
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,456
I don't know
which is more pathetic--

56
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,458
that you're going out
with a 20-year-old

57
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,377
or that you bought a leather
cuff to get a date with her.

58
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:01,745
TED:
I didn't buy this

59
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:02,930
to get a date.

60
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,548
I just happened to be out

61
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,916
catching up on
some Saturday afternoon

62
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,250
leather cuff shopping,
ROBIN: Oh.

63
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,220
and she just happened to be
a leather cuff saleswoman.

64
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,272
(others groan)

65
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:14,475
God, I am so glad I am
done chasing bimbos.

66
00:02:14,477 --> 00:02:16,927
Now that I'm engaged,
that whole part of my life

67
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,529
just seems
sad and empty.

68
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,596
I don't want this
to sound

69
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,899
too harsh, Ted,
but you disgust me.

70
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:25,536
Until a month ago, your
headboard had a lube dispenser.

71
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:26,820
Uh, yeah.

72
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,239
We got rid of that, okay?
Yeah.

73
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,491
ROBIN:
Anyway, speaking of engaged,

74
00:02:30,493 --> 00:02:32,659
check out what got back
from being resized.

75
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:35,829
Oh, my God.
Look at the size of that rock.

76
00:02:35,831 --> 00:02:37,164
Barney, you don't

77
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,449
start with the
I-got-caught-cheating diamond.

78
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,451
You give yourself
room to grow.

79
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,452
It's a family heirloom.

80
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,954
Yeah, I got
a few dirty looks

81
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,422
from Barney's half-sister
over Christmas,

82
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,258
so I had to sit her down
and explain very respectfully...

83
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,343
that she can suck it.

84
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:50,293
(chuckles)
TED: Okay.

85
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,294
I got to bounce.

86
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,179
Stop saying that.

87
00:02:52,181 --> 00:02:53,981
This DJ from Dubai is spinning

88
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,833
at an abandoned loading dock
in Bushwick.

89
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,484
I'm worried I don't
have enough layers.

<i>with a girl</i>
<i>over a decade younger than me</i>

94
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:05,692

00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,495
...disaster. She's like
an entirely different species.

(sneezes)

97
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,949

have enough layers.

100
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,456
Didn't you check your phone?

101
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:21,508
I just "means of contacting" you

102
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,761
on "currently hot
social networking site."

103
00:03:23,763 --> 00:03:24,711

00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:31,852
Oh. Wow, my phone has a clock.

107
00:03:31,854 --> 00:03:35,305
<i>And they subsist on a diet of</i>

Ooh.

109
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,142
Hey, do you want to split
a kimchi cupcake

110
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:39,309
with bacon frosting?

111
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,694
They are the best here.

112
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,362
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, that'll go great with my

113
00:03:42,364 --> 00:03:44,314
cucumber jalapeño
egg cream.

114
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,482
Chug it! Come on. Come on.

115
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:47,117
We got to get going.
Right. Okay.

116
00:03:50,488 --> 00:03:52,522
<i>Then later, at a club</i>
<i>in Chinatown</i>

117
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,875
<i>somehow located</i>
<i>beneath a manhole cover,</i>

118
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:55,993
<i>it got weird.</i>

119
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,294
God, I just love those

120
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:59,797
tiny gray hairs
in your eyebrows.

121
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:02,699
Old men are so sexy.

122
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,834
(Marshall, Lily, Barney
and Robin groan)

123
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,452
All right, to be fair,

124
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:08,138
some of those gray hairs
were dried egg cream.

125
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,339
Turns out, when you

126
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,507
projectile vomit on skates,

127
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:11,758
you roll right into the spray.
(Barney groans)

128
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,311
Wait, how old does
she think you are?

129
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:16,046
So, were you in Vietnam?

130
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,080
(others groan)

131
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:18,632
Hold that groan.

132
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:19,683
(helicopter blades whirring)

133
00:04:19,685 --> 00:04:22,820
Charlie was everywhere.

134
00:04:22,822 --> 00:04:24,738
(others groan)
She's hot! She likes old guys!

135
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,906
Don't judge me!

136
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:29,076
Anyway, when we got out
on the dance floor, th...

137
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,695
I swear, this is what all
the 20-year-olds looked like...

138
00:04:31,697 --> 00:04:34,665
(dance music playing)

139
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,783
(others groan)

140
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,402
I want to thank you for your
service to this nation, Private.

141
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,737
Colonel.

142
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,371
Aw.

143
00:04:41,373 --> 00:04:43,040
I got to end this.

144
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,508
Yeah, seriously, Ted.

145
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,127
Pretending to be someone else
just to get laid?

146
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,012
That's... (scoffs)
embarrassing.

147
00:04:49,014 --> 00:04:50,130
Your Highness!

148
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,349
Let's go.

149
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,918
Ew. Marshall,
take that off.

150
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,221
What? I think it looks
kind of cool.

151
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:58,555
Cool?

152
00:04:58,557 --> 00:05:01,475
You look like one of those jerks
who's in some lame band

153
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:05,529
and rides a motorcycle without
a helmet and has a wallet chain

154
00:05:05,531 --> 00:05:07,898
and neck tattoos
and a drug problem.

155
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,533
Not a... a big one, just, uh...

156
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:13,237
enough that he deals a little
bit on the side, and...

157
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:16,740
he can never...
ever be true to one woman.

158
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,775
Finish that damn pickle
and do me!

159
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,378
(both moaning)

160
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,796
(door opens)
(Robin sighs)

161
00:05:22,798 --> 00:05:25,382
Okay, you guys know how
my mornings usually go.

162
00:05:25,384 --> 00:05:26,750
Why would we care how...

163
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:27,968
Usually it's like this.

164
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,303
(bright, cheerful music plays)

165
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:31,288
After you.

166
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,723
Aw, thank you.

167
00:05:32,725 --> 00:05:35,125
(giggles, gasps)

168
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,263

<i>Wow.</i>

178
00:06:02,538 --> 00:06:05,923
Do little bluebirds help you
get dressed in the morning, too?

179
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,208
♪ She's exaggerating

180
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:14,298
♪ To make a point!

181
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,433
But today was different.

182
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:18,018
(bright, cheerful music plays)

183
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,269
(music ends)
That'll be $3.75.

184
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:21,438
But I didn't have
to pay yesterday.

185
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,106
Okay. $7.50.

186
00:06:23,108 --> 00:06:24,358
(sighs)

187
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,693
Oh, honey-sweetie-baby.
It's the ring, Robin.

188
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:28,178
The ring has power.

189
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,013
When a woman puts on
an engagement ring,

190
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,149
it's like when Bilbo Baggins
wears the One Ring

191
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:33,233
in <i>The Hobbit.</i>

192
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,018
Okay, can you say that again
but not in nerd?

193
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,687
Sure. Uh, the ring
is like the cloak

194
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,040
that Harry Potter wears
to sneak around Hogwarts.

195
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,491
Yeah, I don't speak virgin
either.

196
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,127
The ring-- it
makes you invisible.

197
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:46,330
(ominous music plays)

198
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:49,800
RING (whispers):
You're not precious.

199
00:06:56,474 --> 00:06:59,209
(muffled shouting, gasps)

200
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,177
Oh, good, you're awake.

201
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,812
(gasping)

202
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:03,063
Look, Ted,

203
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,765
there's something
we have to talk about.

204
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,150
Boundaries?
Invasion of privacy?

205
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:09,186
Losing your key privileges?

206
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,571
It's about the 20-year-old, Ted.

207
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,556
You have to bang her.

208
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,025
For me!

209
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:21,033
Why do you want me to hook
up with this 20-year-old?

210
00:07:21,133 --> 00:07:22,516
I thought I disgusted you.

211
00:07:22,518 --> 00:07:24,185
Yeah, that was
all an act.

212
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:26,437
Look, look, look, I love Robin

213
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,806
and she's the only girl
I want to be with.

214
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:32,810
But my body is detoxing
after years of one-night stands.

215
00:07:32,812 --> 00:07:33,794
They don't make

216
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:36,313
gum or a patch for this, Ted.

217
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:38,199
But, hey,
billion-dollar idea alert.

218
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:40,701
(muttering indistinctly)
Oh, yeah.

219
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,870
That's okay. I'll just buy
a new dream journal.

220
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:47,291
What-what-what
are you looking for?

221
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:48,259
Your phone.

222
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,461
There's got to
be some pictures

223
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:50,427
of her in here.

224
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,129
Damn it. No.

225
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,581
Those are all worthless.

226
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,999
I need some one-night-stand
material, Ted.

227
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,269
Oh. Oh. Here's your mom.
Hello, Virginia.

228
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:01,272
Um, my mother is not
one-night-stand material.

229
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:03,808
Yeah, you're right. It wasn't
night and we weren't standing.

230
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,175
Hey-oh!

231
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:06,560
That didn't happen.

232
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:08,979
You're right. It didn't.
(clicks tongue)

233
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:09,897
You just winked.

234
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:11,198
No, I didn't.
(clicks tongue)

235
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,199
You just did it again!

236
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,852
Look, bottom
line: I need you

237
00:08:14,854 --> 00:08:16,787
to proxy bang this girl for me.

238
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:17,955
Be my stand-in

239
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,040
and put your gland in.

240
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,076
Hey, wow,
that'd be good on a hat.

241
00:08:22,078 --> 00:08:23,577
(sighs)
Barney,

242
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,747
she's just using me
for my gracefully aging body.

243
00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:29,366
You're picking now
to get some self-respect?

244
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:33,304
You once banged a blind girl by
pretending to be Sean Connery.

245
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:34,505
That was you.

246
00:08:34,507 --> 00:08:36,206
(imitates Sean Connery):
Yeah, that conquest

247
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,975
was most enjoyable.

248
00:08:37,977 --> 00:08:39,727
I'm sorry.
T-To hook up with a girl,

249
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:42,045
I have to connect with her
at least a little.

250
00:08:42,047 --> 00:08:44,148
Then find a connection.

251
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,399
Just go simple.

252
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,485
Nothing about weird poets
or buildings

253
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,221
or any of those stupid articles
you've ever e-mailed me

254
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:53,724
with the subject line
"Food for thought."

255
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,360
Please, Ted.

256
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,995
I need this.

257
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,663
Fine. You win.

258
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:00,464
I'll bang

259
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,032
a hot 20-year-old.

260
00:09:02,034 --> 00:09:02,883
(sighs)

261
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:03,901
But I'm not gonna enjoy...

262
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:04,902
Oh, who am I kidding?

263
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:06,086
It's gonna be awesome.

264
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,256
Now, turn off the lights and go.

265
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,459
Not all the way!

266
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,513
Hello. Yeah, three...

267
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,999
Okay, normally New York
is the friendliest,

268
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,135
most affordable city
in the world.

269
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:24,371
Now it's as rude and expensive
as San Francisco.

270
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:26,390
Guys?

271
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,309
Oh, hey, that's life
once you're engaged.

272
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:31,362
Oh, tell her, baby.
Make it hurt.

273
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,564
I'll be at the booth.

274
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,482
My panties may
or may not be on

275
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,100
when you get there.

276
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:39,153
(whispers):
They won't be!

277
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:42,072
Okay, what is going
on with you guys?

278
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:43,324
It's the cuff.

279
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:45,876
It turns out that picturing me
as a loser musician

280
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,162
with a Vicodin addiction
and a beat-up van

281
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:52,166
I use to steal copper wire
really turns Lily's crank.

282
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,167
Who knew?

283
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,919
Whoa, what-what happened
to your wrist?

284
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,955
Oh. It's an allergic reaction.

285
00:09:57,957 --> 00:09:59,340
So take it off.

286
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,291
Robin, once you have a child,

287
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:03,477
anything that gets you
even remotely close

288
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:06,847
to the possibility of sex is
worth a few pus-filled blisters.

289
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:09,400
Better the sores
weep than I.

290
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:12,469
Hey, hold on. That
slut just got here.

291
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,571
How'd she get
beer already?

292
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,624
Do you see a ring
on that finger?

293
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,525
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,160
Are you saying that
this invisibility thing

295
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:22,196
means I might not be able
to get beer?

296
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,999
I was just getting used to the
idea of having to pay for coffee

297
00:10:25,001 --> 00:10:26,200
and bagels and rent.

298
00:10:26,202 --> 00:10:27,301
Rent?
But not being able

299
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,753
to get a beer? Unacceptable.

300
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,089
(sighs)

301
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,874
Excuse me.

302
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:35,793
Hot girl coming through.

303
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:41,348
(sighs)

304
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,600
(bright, cheerful music plays)

305
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,853
Huh.
(chuckles)

306
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,355
Three beers, please.

307
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:49,673
♪ Take the...

308
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:51,859
(music stops)

309
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,479
ROBIN:
Damn it, ring!

310
00:10:55,481 --> 00:10:57,347
Oh, yeah, baby.
Mm-hmm.

311
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,616
Later you should totally
go out and buy a switchblade.

312
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:00,951
Mm. Sure.

313
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,854
While I'm out, maybe Daddy
picks up some diapers

314
00:11:03,856 --> 00:11:07,074
and a little mild salsa
because we're low.

315
00:11:07,076 --> 00:11:08,859
(both moaning)

316
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,829
ROBIN:
Well, you're right--

317
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:14,665
I'm invisible.

318
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,200
(Lily moaning)

319
00:11:17,202 --> 00:11:19,670
(Robin gulping)

320
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,538
NARRATOR:
<i>That night, the only person</i>

321
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,425
<i>in worse shape than Robin</i>
<i>was her fiancé.</i>

322
00:11:24,427 --> 00:11:26,260
(panting):
Ted, I'm desperate.

323
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:28,262
Earlier today,
I saw that wrist cuff

324
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:30,314
and I got a partial
for Marshall.

325
00:11:30,316 --> 00:11:31,982
Did you bang that girl yet?

326
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,018
Don't get your hopes,
or anything else, up.

327
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,652
I tried to connect with her,

328
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,554
but everything
just comes back

329
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:39,857
to her weird fetish
about how old I am.

330
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:43,226
Well, j-just go simple--
does she like TV?

331
00:11:43,228 --> 00:11:44,244
No.

332
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:46,330
But I'll watch <i>60 Minutes</i>
with you

333
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,500
as loud and as long as you want.

334
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,534
Sports?

335
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:51,785
No.

336
00:11:51,787 --> 00:11:54,371
But I bet you look super hot
playing shuffleboard,

337
00:11:54,373 --> 00:11:57,791
just... slathered in Bengay.

338
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,209
Well, does she like books?

339
00:11:59,211 --> 00:12:00,744
No.

340
00:12:00,746 --> 00:12:02,763
But I bet you do.

341
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,014
(quietly):
Mm-hmm.

342
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,100
I bet you have a big, thick

343
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:08,302
pair of bifocals.

344
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:11,388
She doesn't have daddy issues,
she has granddaddy issues.

345
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,923
I'm ending it.

346
00:12:12,925 --> 00:12:16,110
Ted, I beg of you, don't quit
on a body that won't quit.

347
00:12:16,112 --> 00:12:18,428
Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet
on a bumper sticker.

348
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,646
That's going in the journal.

349
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,031
TED:
Wait, did you steal

350
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:22,366
my dream journal?

351
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,952
No! Now, get back in there
before all your teeth fall out

352
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,154
and you're naked in front
of Shaker Heights High School

353
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,872
in a play
you never rehearsed for.

354
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,273
Bastard!

355
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:33,110
We don't connect
on a single thing. It's over.

356
00:12:33,112 --> 00:12:35,496
(beep)
It's not...

357
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:37,131
Look, Carly, I got
to tell you something.

358
00:12:37,133 --> 00:12:39,950
I just, I don't see
a future here.

359
00:12:39,952 --> 00:12:42,219
Oh, my God.

360
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,421
Are you dying?

361
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,424
(sighs):
Oh, that is so hot.

362
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,977
(robotic beeping)

363
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,512
Hey...

364
00:12:51,514 --> 00:12:53,147
is that R2-D2?

365
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,399
Do you like <i>Star Wars?</i>

366
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,300
I love <i>Star Wars.</i>

367
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,635
Me, too!

368
00:12:58,637 --> 00:13:01,972
♪

369
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:04,575
I mean, I've only
seen the new ones.

370
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,610
Close enough.

371
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,482
So?

372
00:13:12,484 --> 00:13:13,367
Yeah.

373
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:15,085
I knew it!
I could feel it.

374
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,122
It's almost like we were
hooking up with her together.

375
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:19,373
You felt that, right?

376
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,924
I couldn't have performed
if I did.

377
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,292
Don't you see, Ted?

378
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,962
We had a bro-nnection.

379
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:27,164
(clicking tongue)
All right, I got to know

380
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,715
what she looks like--
show me a picture.

381
00:13:28,717 --> 00:13:30,667
Well, normally,
I'm above such things,

382
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:33,804
but it's been a while,
and, uh, Teddy's braggin'.

383
00:13:33,806 --> 00:13:35,505
(chuckles)
Okay, here she is.

384
00:13:36,057 --> 00:13:38,642
Okay. Scrolling up.

385
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,860
Oh, yeah, those are

386
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,845
"plow me" heels. Nice.
Uh-huh.

387
00:13:41,847 --> 00:13:45,365
The knee bruise is encouraging.

388
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,685
Working our way up
to those 20-year-old ta-tas.

389
00:13:48,687 --> 00:13:51,121
Oh... gravity's cruel grasp

390
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:54,191
hasn't found you yet,
my sweet perky miracles.

391
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:55,742
(chuckles)

392
00:13:55,744 --> 00:13:57,828
Now, let's get a gander
at Dirty Girl's face.

393
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:58,829
Mm-hmm.

394
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,197
(gasps)

395
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:04,084
Her face says, "Ready to bone,"
am I right?

396
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,088
I say again, am I right?

397
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:11,752
That's my half sister.

398
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:17,396
Then you probably shouldn't
scroll to the next picture.

399
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,384
No!

400
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:27,128
That's my sister, Ted!

401
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:28,728
Well, look,
I didn't know!

402
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,529
None of us even knew
you had a sister

403
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:32,498
until two years ago,
including you!

404
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,233
This is just
some crazy coincidence.

405
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,569
There are four million women
in the city of New York,

406
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:38,070
Ted, and you sleep
with my sister?

407
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,104
Why would the universe
do that to me?

408
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:40,991
I don't know.

409
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:43,075
It's not like you've ever
treated women in such a way

410
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:44,627
that would invite some sort
of karmic retribution.

411
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,945
You banged my sister!

412
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,799
My sweet, little, innocent...

413
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,267
Pierced.
Really? Where?

414
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,619
Don't answer that!
Now I know

415
00:14:53,621 --> 00:14:56,806
why I felt everything
you did to her last night.

416
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:00,559
It wasn't a bro-nnection,
it was a sis-nnection!

417
00:15:00,561 --> 00:15:01,844
Oh, my God.

418
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:04,980
Ted... did you...

419
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:09,185
Big-time.

420
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:10,469
Nice! High five!

421
00:15:10,471 --> 00:15:12,021
Wait! No! No!

422
00:15:12,023 --> 00:15:13,272
Retraction five!

423
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,908
(speaks words
in reverse)

424
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,527
Hey, hey, you're the one
who begged for a proxy bang.

425
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:20,162
And while we're
on the subject of family,

426
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:22,865
I'm pretty sure you banged
my mom-- mom beats sister.

427
00:15:22,867 --> 00:15:25,334
I never banged your mom.
(clicks tongue)

428
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:27,152
You just did
the winking thing again!

429
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,004
No, I didn't.
(clicks tongue)

430
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:31,207
Fine. Hey, Barney,
let me ask you something.

431
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,209
Were you, uh, feeling
a little sore this morning?

432
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,460
Especially...

433
00:15:36,046 --> 00:15:37,179
(gasps)

434
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,382
Friendship over!

435
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:42,635
Oh, yeah.

436
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:47,807
Who's your guitar-player-biker-
who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa-

437
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:51,193
but-said-screw-it-
and-went-medium bad boy?

438
00:15:51,195 --> 00:15:53,011
(moans)

439
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:54,563
Marshall, your hand!

440
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:56,599
NARRATOR: <i>Okay, I'm pretty sure</i>
<i>it wasn't that bad,</i>

441
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,351
but this is how Uncle Marshall
<i>likes to tell the story.</i>

442
00:15:59,353 --> 00:16:02,238
Oh, yeah, no,
that's the cuff.

443
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,357
I'm woozy,
and I can't flex my fingers...

444
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:06,525
(sniffs)

445
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,627
...and the rotten fish smell
is getting stronger.

446
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,497
But I'm learning to compensate
with my left.

447
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:14,633
Is that why last night when
I asked you to honka honka me

448
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,085
you only honka'd me?

449
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:17,536
I didn't think you noticed.

450
00:16:17,538 --> 00:16:20,556
Snap's been jealous
of Crackle all day.

451
00:16:20,558 --> 00:16:22,475
Just take the cuff off.

452
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,760
No, but, baby,
then all the sex will stop.

453
00:16:24,762 --> 00:16:28,681
Marshall, you don't need a cuff
for me to find you sexy.

454
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,182
All you have to do

455
00:16:30,184 --> 00:16:32,785
is smile, and I'm ready
for you to hop on Pop.

456
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:35,237
(chuckles softly)
Thanks, baby.

457
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:38,557
Are you too woozy to
do it one last time

458
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,193
before we seek emergency
medical attention?

459
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:43,061
Only one way to find out.

460
00:16:43,063 --> 00:16:45,063
Mm.

461
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:53,005
I'm sorry, bro,
I totally overreacted.

462
00:16:53,007 --> 00:16:54,740
You think?
I can't believe

463
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:56,842
you're allowed
to ship a dead possum.

464
00:16:56,844 --> 00:16:58,344
He died?

465
00:16:58,346 --> 00:17:01,547
That possum was supposed
to be an olive branch.

466
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:04,967
Are you sure
he's not just playing dead?

467
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,936
He smells like Marshall's hand.

468
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:08,888
And wait, you-you forgive me?

469
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,106
Absolutely.
Hey, I got a couple "cee-gars."

470
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:12,308
Get over here!

471
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:15,227
All right.
So, where are those "cee-gars"?

472
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:16,929
Eh, we'll break 'em
out in a minute.

473
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,781
(knocks)
Hey, Barn.

474
00:17:19,616 --> 00:17:21,317
Ted?

475
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,435
Barney, what is
your sister doing here?

476
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:25,437
Nothing, bro.
Or should I say,

477
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,623
bro-in-law!

478
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:31,660
(organ playing "Wedding March")

479
00:17:38,618 --> 00:17:40,336
("Wedding March" continues)

480
00:17:40,338 --> 00:17:41,670
Congratulations!

481
00:17:41,672 --> 00:17:44,423
You're marrying
my sister!

482
00:17:44,425 --> 00:17:47,426
And you spared no expense,
you big crazy!

483
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,298
You know what?
I love Barney,

484
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,600
but this ring thing sucks.

485
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,819
Some gross guy just
brushed up against my rack

486
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:58,270
and then apologized.

487
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,689
And I think he really,
really meant it.

488
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:04,076
Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice
to be groped by strangers,

489
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:06,161
but nothing beats
the rush you get

490
00:18:06,163 --> 00:18:08,647
when that one special person
looks at you.

491
00:18:08,649 --> 00:18:10,115
It's true.

492
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:14,169
Like here in this bar, there's
only one thing that I see,

493
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:17,373
and I see her brighter
and more clearly

494
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,209
than anything else
in this world.

495
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:22,177
You know what that is?

496
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:23,829
That's love.

497
00:18:24,564 --> 00:18:26,131
And possibly alcohol

498
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:29,351
mixed with some
very powerful antibiotics.

499
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,171
And that's how Barney sees you.

500
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,891
And I know that's
how you see Barney.

501
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,845
(clears throat) I'd like
to start the service

502
00:18:39,847 --> 00:18:42,197
with a passage
from Ted's dream journal.

503
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:44,700
"Drowning.

504
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,702
"Gasping for air.

505
00:18:46,704 --> 00:18:48,854
No escape."

506
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:51,356
Wait, is that
about Vietnam?

507
00:18:51,358 --> 00:18:52,541
It's about Whole Foods.

508
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,242
Barney.

509
00:18:53,244 --> 00:18:54,359
We are not

510
00:18:54,361 --> 00:18:55,527
getting married.

511
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:58,581
And those aisles
are too narrow!

512
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,832
BARNEY:
But you two

513
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,667
have to get married--
otherwise, it's just

514
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:05,037
a cheap, meaningless,
disgusting one-night stand.

515
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,806
Wait, just to be clear,
you're saying you're <i>opposed</i>

516
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,676
to cheap, meaningless,
disgusting one-night stands?

517
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:11,710
Yes.

518
00:19:11,712 --> 00:19:13,879
Barney... don't you see?

519
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,881
Your detox is done!

520
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:17,900
You're over one-night stands!

521
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:20,235
Oh, my God, you're right!

522
00:19:20,237 --> 00:19:21,937
I'm free!
Yeah.

523
00:19:21,939 --> 00:19:25,107
So if you think about it--
but not too much--

524
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,776
it's actually good that
Carly and I hooked up.

525
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:29,745
Yeah, it's really good.

526
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:33,365
I mean, this guy goes at it
like he's still in his 50s.

527
00:19:33,367 --> 00:19:35,784
Hey, have a cigar,
you big crazy!

528
00:19:35,786 --> 00:19:36,785
(chuckles)

529
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:38,621
Hey, don't try
to make this okay.

530
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,205
You still slept with my sister.

531
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:43,125
Promise me you will never,
ever do that again.

532
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,911
I promise.
(clicks tongue)

533
00:19:45,913 --> 00:19:47,046
You just winked.

534
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:49,048
No, I didn't.
(clicks tongue)

535
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,966
You did it again!
No, I didn't!

536
00:19:50,968 --> 00:19:52,017
You swear, right?

537
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:54,419
Yeah. Of course.

538
00:19:54,971 --> 00:19:56,772
(clicks tongue)

539
00:19:59,809 --> 00:20:01,457
Hey.
<i>That night,</i>

540
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:03,425
<i>even though</i>
<i>she still couldn't get a beer,</i>

541
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:06,845
<i>Robin realized</i>
<i>the</i> true <i>power of the ring.</i>

542
00:20:06,847 --> 00:20:10,415
♪

543
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,487
Hey, Robin.

544
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:16,909
Did you ever figure out
how you're gonna get

545
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,827
a drink at the bar now
that you're engaged?

546
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:21,580
Oh, sure. I know a way
that's gonna last forever.

547
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,281
Scotch on the rocks?

548
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:24,416
Coming right up.

549
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:33,642
Now, before you say anything
about the hat...

550
00:20:33,644 --> 00:20:37,295
this new girl's ass
is <i>phenomenal!</i>

551
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,020
LILY: Hey, Marshall,
you got to see this.

552
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:46,245
The catalog must have
mixed up my order.

553
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:48,011
You won't believe the jeans
they just sent me.

554
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,112
(mumbles)

555
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,947
Hilarious, right?

556
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,483
Totally.
(laughs)

557
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,102
You look like some

558
00:20:55,104 --> 00:20:57,952
suburban mom
who drives a minivan

559
00:20:58,052 --> 00:21:01,187
filled with stale Cheerios
and empty juice boxes...

560
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,851
(laughs)
probably makes

561
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,939
chili mac and
Frito pie for dinner...

562
00:21:05,941 --> 00:21:08,612
smells like that menthol
cigarette that she snuck while

563
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:10,692
she was waiting
to pick her kids up

564
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,158
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
