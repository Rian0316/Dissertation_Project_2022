老爸老妈浪漫史
第八季  第十四集

13
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,830
各位  刚才发生的事太神奇了
You guys. You guys will not believe what just happened.

14
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,090
我过来时  一辆出租车撞上人行道的路缘
On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb

15
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,290
压住了一位老太太
and it pinned this old lady,

16
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,650
我马上过去帮忙  开启了大力士模式
and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode

17
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,100
把车从她身上抬了起来
and I somehow lifted it off her.

18
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,980
天啊  泰德  你的手腕
Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist.

19
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,470
对哦  是有点肿了
Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen.

20
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,980
-肯定是抬车时拉伤了  -不
- I must've strained it lifting. - No,

21
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,580
我觉得亲爱的莉莉指的是
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring

22
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,910
你另外一只手腕
to your other wrist.

23
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,150
带着男性节育环的那只
The one wearing the male birth control.

24
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,150
一般节育环是放置于女性子宫内部

25
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,350
我本来准备说"婚前禁欲手镯"的
I was gonna go with "Chastity bracelet."

26
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,350
这种手镯一般只是信基督教的女人才戴

27
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,680
天啊  还能更爱你吗
God, is it possible to love you more?

28
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,870
真的假的  我刚才救了别人一命
Really? Really? I just saved someone's life,

29
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,300
而你们关注的重点竟然是这个
and you guys are focusing on this?

30
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,990
就是  各位  不要嘲笑他了
Yeah, you know what, guys? Leave him alone.

31
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,040
他是个英雄
All right, he's a hero.

32
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,200
谢谢
Thank you.

33
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,510
你觉得你有超能力是因为
Do you think that your super strength came from

34
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,660
戴着神奇女侠的魔力护腕吗
wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?

35
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,070
我告诉你们  因为这个护腕
Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff,

36
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,310
我有了个约会
I have a date.

37
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,870
是跟护手霜和互联网约"打飞机"吗
With some hand lotion and the Internet?

38
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,980
原来真的可以更爱你
It is possible to love you more!

39
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,420
是跟真人约会
She exists.

40
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,140
她就在酒吧外
And she's right outside.

41
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,540
太好了  带她进来啊
Great. Bring her in.

42
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,960
其实外面天气很好
You know what? It's so nice out.

43
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,720
我们何不出去散散步
Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.

44
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,070
外面下倾盆大雨呢  泰德  
It's pouring rain, Ted.

45
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,420
显然是她太胖  进不了酒吧的门
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.

46
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,430
她是个漂亮的运动型姑娘
She is a gorgeous, athletic woman.

47
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,680
"运动型"  浓鬓角没胸部
"Athletic"? Sideburns, no cans.

48
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,800
她是辣妹
She is hot.

49
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,880
那她为什么不能进来  泰德
So why can't she come in, Ted?

50
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,180
她当然能进来
She can come in.

51
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,090
再等六个半月后就能了
In six and a half months.

52
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,040
等等  你是在说她今年...
Wait. Are you saying she's...

53
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,070
二十岁
Twenty.

54
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,320
半
And a half.

55
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,610
左右
Almost.

56
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,150
等等  各位
Hold up, guys.

57
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,600
她得闪了
She had to bounce.

58
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,640
因为有一群快闪族出现在
Um, a flash mob broke out in front

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,020
威廉斯堡的一排墨西哥韩式快餐车前
of a line of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg.

60
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,160
唯一能让她更像20岁姑娘的东西是
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old

61
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,550
她搞笑的交通工具
is an ironic form of transportation.

62
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,290
她穿着轮滑鞋
She's roller skating there.

63
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,500
我不知道哪件事更可悲
I don't know which is more pathetic--

64
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,430
是你和二十岁的小妞约会
that you're going out with a 20-year-old

65
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,420
还是你为了和她约会买了个皮质护腕
or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.

66
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,770
我又不是因为她才买这个
I didn't buy this to get a date.

67
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,420
只是碰巧赶上
I just happened to be out

68
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,230
我周六下午出门
catching up on some Saturday afternoon

69
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,330
选购皮质护腕
leather cuff shopping,

70
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,400
而她  碰巧是卖皮质护腕的妹子
and she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.

71
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,430
天啊  真庆幸我的泡妞生涯结束了
God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos.

72
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,680
现在我订婚了  过去泡妞的生活
Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life

73
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,590
看起来可悲又空洞
just seems sad and empty.

74
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,740
我不是故意要说得这么难听
I don't want this to sound too harsh,

75
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,830
泰德  但是你让我恶心
Ted, but you disgust me.

76
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,460
一个月前  你家床头板上还有润滑油机呢
Until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser.

77
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,660
对
Uh, yeah.

78
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:29,190
-我们把它扔了  -对
- We got rid of that, okay? - Yeah.

79
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,480
说到订婚
Anyway, speaking of engaged,

80
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,750
快瞧什么东西改好尺寸啦
check out what got back from being resized.

81
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,990
天啊  好大一颗钻石
Oh, my God. Look at the size of that rock.

82
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,820
巴尼  你不能一开始就买
Barney, you don't start with

83
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,470
一颗"偷情赎罪级"的大钻石
the I-got-caught-cheating diamond.

84
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,350
你得给自己留点发展空间啊
You give yourself room to grow.

85
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
这是传家宝
It's a family heirloom.

86
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,830
圣诞节期间
Yeah, I got a few dirty looks

87
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,400
巴尼的嫂子一直对我甩白眼
from Barney's half-sister over Christmas,

88
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
所以我请她坐下  然后毕恭毕敬地解释
so I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully...

89
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,960
让她羡慕嫉妒恨吧
that she can suck it.

90
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,290
好吧  我得闪了
Okay. I got to bounce.

91
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,370
别这样说
Stop saying that.

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,120
迪拜来的DJ在布什维克
This DJ from Dubai is spinning

93
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,070
一个废弃的装货码头打碟
at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.

94
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,840
我担心我衣服穿少了会冷
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.

95
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,250
<i>就算我朋友们都不看好又怎样</i>
<i>So what if my friends thought it was doomed?</i>

96
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,210
<i>我当时还年轻</i>
<i>I was still young, </i>

97
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,080
<i>知道和比我小十岁的姑娘</i>
<i>and I knew that a night of partying with a girl</i>

98
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,670
<i>狂欢一晚  完全是一场...</i>
<i>over a decade younger than me would be a total...</i>

99
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,470
灾难  
...disaster.

100
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,650
她和我简直是两个世界的人
She's like an entirely different species.

101
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,730
而且我衣服绝对穿少了
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.

102
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,890
她说的词语  我一半都听不懂
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.

103
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,810
我听起来都像嬉皮士版的填词游戏
To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs.

104
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,350
你没看手机吗
Didn't you check your phone?

105
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,530
我刚在"目前很热的社交网站"上
I just "means of contacting" you

106
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,860
"联系"了你
on "currently hot social networking site."

107
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,950
表演改到
The show's been moved

108
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,030
"你从未听说过的纽约郊区"去了
to "New York neighborhood you've never heard of."

109
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,680
我的手机上居然会显示时间
Oh. Wow, my phone has a clock.

110
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,730
而且他们很爱吃超怪异的混合风食品
And they subsist on a diet of pointlessly weird combinations.

111
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,050
你要不要跟我分吃个泡菜小蛋糕
Hey, do you want to split a kimchi cupcake

112
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,200
上面有培根糖霜哦
with bacon frosting?

113
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,500
这是最美味的搭配
They are the best here.

114
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,080
好啊  跟我的黄瓜胡椒蛋蜜乳
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that'll go great with my

115
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,270
估计也会很搭吧
cucumber jalapeno egg cream.

116
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,700
快喝  快点  快点
Chug it! Come on. Come on.

117
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
-我们得走了  -好吧
- We got to get going. - Right. Okay.

118
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,520
然后  在唐人街
Then later, at a club in Chinatown

119
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,880
井盖下的一个酒吧
somehow located beneath a manhole cover,

120
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,100
事情变得很诡异
it got weird.

121
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,170
天啊  我真喜欢
God, I just love those

122
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,660
你眉毛里的小灰毛
tiny gray hairs in your eyebrows.

123
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,610
老人好性感
Old men are so sexy.

124
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,340
好了  公平地说
All right, to be fair,

125
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,430
有些小灰毛其实是干了的蛋蜜乳
some of those gray hairs were dried egg cream.

126
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,420
原来一边溜冰一边呕吐
Turns out, when you projectile vomit on skates,

127
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,940
吐出来的东西会直接溅你一脸
you roll right into the spray.

128
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
她到底觉得你有多老
Wait, how old does she think you are?

129
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,080
你去越南参战了吗[1959年-1975年]
So, were you in Vietnam?

130
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,450
等等再叹息
Hold that groan.

131
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,580
越共无所不在啊
Charlie was everywhere.

132
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,960
她是辣妹  喜欢老人
She's hot! She likes old guys!

133
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,130
别批判我
Don't judge me!

134
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,100
总之  当我们进入舞池时
Anyway, when we got out on the dance floor, th...

135
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,490
我发誓  二十岁的人就是这个样子
I swear, this is what all the 20-year-olds looked like...

136
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,190
谢谢你对国家做出的贡献  士兵
I want to thank you for your service to this nation, Private.

137
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,400
是上校
Colonel.

138
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,600
我得做个了断
I got to end this.

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,480
没错  说真的  泰德
Yeah, seriously, Ted.

140
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,000
假扮别人  骗妞上床
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid?

141
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,830
那  太尴尬了
That's... embarrassing.

142
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,240
殿下
Your Highness!

143
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,390
我们走
Let's go.

144
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,300
马修  把护腕脱了
Ew. Marshall, take that off.

145
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,450
为什么  我觉得挺酷的
What? I think it looks kind of cool.

146
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,350
酷
Cool?

147
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,390
你看就像某个烂乐队的小混混
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band

148
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,000
骑摩托车不带头盔
and rides a motorcycle without a helmet

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,720
腰上挂着钱包链  脖子上有纹身
and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,110
还爱吸毒
and a drug problem.

151
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,230
毒瘾不是很大
Not a... a big one, just, uh...

152
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,660
但也够让他暗地里贩贩毒
enough that he deals a little bit on the side, and...

153
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,700
他绝不会对女人动真情
he can never... ever be true to one woman.

154
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,390
快把你的咸菜吃完  开"干"了
Finish that damn pickle and do me!

155
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,070
你们都知道我的早晨通常是怎样的吧
Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go.

156
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,610
我们不想知道
Why would we care how...

157
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,460
通常是这样的
Usually it's like this.

158
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,880
你先
After you.

159
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,300
谢谢
Aw, thank you.

160
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,910
送你的  罗宾
On the house, Robin!

161
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,940
贝果圈送你 *
* Take this bagel on the house

162
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,930
报纸送你 *
* Have a paper on the house

163
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:46,700
只要你愿意 *
* I'd give you a house on the house

164
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,050
房子也可送你 *
* If I could

165
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,380
沉鱼落雁之姿 *
* You're so beautiful

166
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,020
世间万物皆可送你 *
* Everything in life should be free

167
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,440
做自己感觉真美好 *
* It's so wonderful to be me!

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,950
知更鸟也会在早上帮你更衣吗
Do little bluebirds help you get dressed in the morning, too?

169
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,380
她只是夸张地表达观点 *
* She's exaggerating to make a point!

170
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,880
但是今天一切都变了
But today was different.

171
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,560
3.75元
That'll be $3.75.

172
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,400
我昨天就没付钱啊
But I didn't have to pay yesterday.

173
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,640
好吧  那就7.5元
Okay. $7.50.

174
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,020
-我亲爱的乖乖  -是戒指  罗宾
- Oh, honey-sweetie-baby. - It's the ring, Robin.

175
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,130
那戒指有魔力
The ring has power.

176
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,920
当女人戴上订婚戒指时
When a woman puts on an engagement ring,

177
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,260
就像《指环王》哈比人中比尔博・巴金斯
it's like when Bilbo Baggins wears the One Ring

178
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,040
戴上至尊魔戒一样
in The Hobbit.

179
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,950
这么宅男的解释我听不懂
Okay, can you say that again but not in nerd?

180
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,850
好吧  戒指就像哈利波特
Sure. Uh, the ring is like the cloak

181
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,880
在霍格沃茨潜行时穿的斗篷
that Harry Potter wears to sneak around Hogwarts.

182
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,370
这么"处男"[童话]的解释  我也听不懂
Yeah, I don't speak virgin either.

183
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,580
那枚戒指  会让你变隐形
The ring-- it makes you invisible.

184
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,620
你不是宝贝...[改自指环王]
You're not precious.

185
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,680
很好  你还没睡
Oh, good, you're awake.

186
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,140
泰德
Look, Ted,

187
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,760
有些事我们得谈一谈
there's something we have to talk about.

188
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,220
朋友界线  侵犯隐私
Boundaries? Invasion of privacy?

189
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,450
没收我家的钥匙
Losing your key privileges?

190
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,480
是关于那个20岁的小妞  泰德
It's about the 20-year-old, Ted.

191
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,630
你必须把她上了
You have to bang her.

192
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,100
为了我
For me!

193
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:21,210
你为什么要我勾搭20岁的女孩
Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?

194
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,480
你不是很恶心我的行为吗
I thought I disgusted you.

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,730
对  不过那是我装的
Yeah, that was all an act.

196
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,550
听我说听我说  我爱罗宾
Look, look, look, I love Robin

197
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,890
我只想和她在一起
and she's the only girl I want to be with.

198
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,010
但是因为常年的一夜情
But my body is detoxing

199
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,360
我的身体还没完全戒掉
after years of one-night stands.

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,690
世上也没有戒掉
They don't make gum

201
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,630
一夜情的贴片或口香糖  泰德
or a patch for this, Ted.

202
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,870
但这貌似是个挣大钱的点子
But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert.

203
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,340
好吧  没事
Oh, yeah. That's okay.

204
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,770
我再买一本新的梦之日记
I'll just buy a new dream journal.

205
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,400
你在找什么
What-what-what are you looking for?

206
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,660
你的电话
Your phone.

207
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,550
手机里一定有她的照片吧
There's got to be some pictures of her in here.

208
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,320
我靠  不
Damn it. No.

209
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,830
这些都没用
Those are all worthless.

210
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,140
我需要一夜情的素材  泰德
I need some one-night-stand material, Ted.

211
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,630
这是你妈  你好啊  弗吉尼亚
Oh. Oh. Here's your mom. Hello, Virginia.

212
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,540
我妈可不是一夜情[站]的素材
Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material.

213
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,430
你说得对  
Yeah, you're right.

214
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,150
当时不是夜里  我们也不是站着
It wasn't night and we weren't standing.

215
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,350
你们没有"干"嘛吧
That didn't happen.

216
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,070
没  当然没
You're right. It didn't.

217
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,090
你眨眼了
You just winked.

218
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,110
不  我没有
No, I didn't.

219
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,400
你又眨眼了
You just did it again!

220
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,750
行了  总之  我需要你
Look, bottom line: I need you

221
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,390
替我  上了那妞
to proxy bang this girl for me.

222
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,820
做我的替身
Be my stand-in

223
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,480
用你的"小弟"
and put your gland in.

224
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,850
这印在潮帽上应该挺酷
Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat.

225
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,890
巴尼
Barney,

226
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:27,010
她只是喜欢我优雅老去的身体
she's just using me for my gracefully aging body.

227
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,760
你挑这个时候来获得自尊吗
You're picking now to get some self-respect?

228
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,520
你曾经假装肖恩・康纳利  骗盲女和你上床
You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.

229
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,000
苏格兰电影演员  007第一任扮演者

230
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,010
那是你干的
That was you.

231
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,170
没错  那次经历真是滋味无限
Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable.

232
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,180
抱歉  要勾搭女孩
I'm sorry. T-To hook up with a girl,

233
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,200
我至少得和她有点共同之处吧
I have to connect with her at least a little.

234
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,240
找一个共同之处呗
Then find a connection.

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,890
找点简单的
Just go simple.

236
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,870
别找什么奇怪的诗或建筑之类 
Nothing about weird poets or buildings

237
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,520
或是任何你取名为《精神粮食》
or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me

238
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,340
电邮给我的烂文章
with the subject line "Food for thought."

239
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,530
拜托了  泰德
Please, Ted.

240
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,280
你不"上"  我会死啊
I need this.

241
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,880
好吧  你赢了
Fine. You win.

242
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,520
我会上一个20岁的姑娘
I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.

243
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,980
但是我可不会乐在其中
But I'm not gonna enjoy...

244
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,180
骗谁呢
Oh, who am I kidding?

245
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,830
肯定是爽翻了
It's gonna be awesome.

246
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,640
现在  关灯  滚蛋
Now, turn off the lights and go.

247
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,450
别全关掉
Not all the way!

248
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,790
你好  三杯...
Hello. Yeah, three...

249
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,270
纽约本来是全世界最友好
Okay, normally New York is the friendliest,

250
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,580
最住得起的城市
most affordable city in the world.

251
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,890
现在呢  和旧金山一样  又粗鲁又昂贵  
Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.

252
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,380
你们说呢
Guys?

253
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,610
这就是订婚后的生活
Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged.

254
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,010
告诉她吧  宝贝  让她伤心吧
Oh, tell her, baby. Make it hurt.

255
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,430
我去卡座了
I'll be at the booth.

256
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,720
等你来时  我的小内内
My panties may or may not be on

257
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,360
可能在  也可能不在哦
when you get there.

258
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,340
肯定不在了
They won't be!

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,330
你们是怎么回事啊
Okay, what is going on with you guys?

260
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,570
是护腕的魔力
It's the cuff.

261
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,020
把我想象成嗑药的蹩脚音乐人
It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician

262
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,460
还有一辆用来偷铜线的破旧货车
with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van

263
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,170
让莉莉性趣盎然
I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.

264
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,310
谁会想得到呢
Who knew?

265
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,220
你的手腕怎么了
Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?

266
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,230
对护腕过敏了
Oh. It's an allergic reaction.

267
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,740
那就取下来呀
So take it off.

268
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,550
罗宾  一旦为人父母之后
Robin, once you have a child,

269
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,640
只要能换来一点点滚床单的可能性
anything that gets you even remotely close

270
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,580
几个化脓的水泡又算得了什么
to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters.

271
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,710
再疼也胜过我"下半身"煎熬啊
Better the sores weep than I.

272
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,810
等一下  那个小荡货刚进酒吧
Hey, hold on. That slut just got here.

273
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,690
怎么这么快就买到酒了
How'd she get beer already?

274
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,980
你看她手指上有戴订婚戒了吗
Do you see a ring on that finger?

275
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,830
你是说这戒指的隐形作用
Are you saying that this invisibility thing

276
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,590
会害得我以后都没法买到酒了吗
means I might not be able to get beer?

277
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,090
人家才刚刚开始习惯自己买咖啡
I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee

278
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,410
-贝果圈和付房租呢  -房租啊
- and bagels and rent. - Rent?

279
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,610
现在连一杯酒都买不到  
But not being able to get a beer?

280
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,350
我决不接受
Unacceptable.

281
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,070
抱歉
Excuse me.

282
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,110
请为辣妹让一下路
Hot girl coming through.

283
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,320
请给我三杯啤酒
Three beers, please.

284
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,890
靠  我讨厌这戒指
Damn it, ring!

285
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,660
亲爱的
Oh, yeah, baby.

286
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,880
一会记得出去买把弹簧刀
Later you should totally go out and buy a switchblade.

287
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,210
好呀
Sure.

288
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,120
或许爸爸会顺便买些尿布
While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers

289
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,350
和微辣的莎莎酱  因为我们无比堕落
and a little mild salsa because we're low.

290
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,570
好吧  你说对了
Well, you're right--

291
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,390
我已经化为无形了
I'm invisible.

292
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,420
<i>那一夜  唯一一个比罗宾还狼狈的人</i>
<i>That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin </i>

293
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,680
<i>是她的未婚夫</i>
<i>was her fiance.</i>

294
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,770
泰德  我快被逼疯了
Ted, I'm desperate.

295
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,570
今天上午  我看到那护腕
Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff

296
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,600
就给马修买了一副
and I got a partial for Marshall.

297
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,310
你把那妞上了吗
Did you bang that girl yet?

298
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,630
你别激动   也别"鸡"动 
Don't get your hopes, or anything else, up.

299
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,230
我试着和她找话题
I tried to connect with her,

300
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,950
可不管说什么
but everything just comes back

301
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,120
最后总是回到她对我年纪的痴迷上去
to her weird fetish about how old I am.

302
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,540
先从简单入手吧  她喜欢看电视吗
Well, j-just go simple-- does she like TV?

303
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,930
不喜欢
No.

304
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,480
但如果我愿意陪你一起看《60分钟》
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you

305
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,480
美国老牌新闻节目

306
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,370
开多大声看多久都没问题
as loud and as long as you want.

307
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,730
体育呢
Sports?

308
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,060
不喜欢
No.

309
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,500
不过我猜你玩沙壶球时一定帅爆了
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard,

310
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,500
一种老年人常玩的运动

311
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,740
想象你厚厚地涂满止痛药膏的样子
just... slathered in Bengay.

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,520
好吧  那她喜欢读书吗
Well, does she like books?

313
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,850
不喜欢
No.

314
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,450
可我猜你一定喜欢
But I bet you do.

315
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,420
你一定有一个又大又厚的...
I bet you have a big, thick

316
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,760
老花眼镜
pair of bifocals.

317
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,600
她这已经不是恋父情节了  
She doesn't have daddy issues,

318
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,280
而是恋祖父情节
she has granddaddy issues.

319
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,190
我要和她说再见了
I'm ending it.

320
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,500
泰德  求你了  
Ted, I beg of you,

321
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,830
只要她一息尚存  你就不能放弃
don't quit on a body that won't quit.

322
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,890
这句话用来做车标不错
Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker.

323
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:20,680
我要写在日记上
That's going in the journal.

324
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,580
等等  你偷走了我的梦之日记吗
Wait, did you steal my dream journal?

325
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,840
才没有  好了  在你牙齿落光
No! Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out

326
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,560
和你在自己高中全校师生面前裸体出演
and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School

327
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,960
没排练过的戏剧前  快回去吧
in a play you never rehearsed for.

328
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,480
你个王八蛋
Bastard!

329
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,920
我们之间毫无共通处  绝对要分手了
We don't connect on a single thing. It's over.

330
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,220
不要
It's not...

331
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,730
听着卡莉  我要告诉你
Look, Carly, I got to tell you something.

332
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,260
我们之间不会有未来
I just, I don't see a future here.

333
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,960
我的妈呀
Oh, my God.

334
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,070
你是要死了吗
Are you dying?

335
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,000
真是迷死人了
Oh, that is so hot.

336
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,590
我说  你这是R2-D2的声音吗
Hey... is that R2-D2?

337
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,590
星球大战宇航技工机器人

338
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,960
你喜欢《星球大战》吗
Do you like Star Wars?

339
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,880
我超爱《星球大战》
I love Star Wars.

340
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,420
我也是
Me, too!

341
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,450
虽然我只看过最新的几部
I mean, I've only seen the new ones.

342
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,470
那也成啊
Close enough.

343
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,420
-结果...  -上了
- So? - Yeah.

344
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,760
我就知道  我能感应得到
I knew it! I could feel it.

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,410
感觉就跟咱俩一起上了她似的
It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.

346
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,900
你也有同感  对吧
You felt that, right?

347
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,270
要真有这感觉  我就不做了
I couldn't have performed if I did.

348
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,740
你没发现吗  泰德
Don't you see, Ted?

349
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,360
我们俩有兄弟感应啊
We had a bro-nnection.

350
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,430
好了  我得知道她长什么样
All right, I got to know what she looks like--

351
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,270
给我看照片
show me a picture.

352
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,350
一般来说  我不屑于干这种事的
Well, normally, I'm above such things,

353
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,470
但我单身已经很久了  泰德也想炫耀一下
but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'.

354
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,200
好了  这就是她
Okay, here she is.

355
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,750
好  从下往上慢慢看
Okay. Scrolling up.

356
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,700
脚踩"求开垦"高跟鞋  不错不错
Oh, yeah, those are "plow me" Heels. Nice. Uh-huh.

357
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,760
膝盖的瘀痕  让人食指大动
The knee bruise is encouraging.

358
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,190
一路上拉到二十岁的尖峰处
Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.

359
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,910
哇  地心引力的残酷魔爪
Oh... gravity's cruel grasp

360
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,980
还没有伸向你  我可爱的奇迹翘乳
hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles.

361
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,030
现在  让我们瞧瞧小浪娃的庐山真面目吧
Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face.

362
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,380
她的脸上写着"欢迎来搞"  对不对
Her face says, "Ready to bone," Am I right?

363
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,310
再重复一次  我说得对不对
I say again, am I right?

364
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,990
这是我同父异母的妹妹
That's my half-sister.

365
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,040
那你还是不要看下一张照片的好
Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.

366
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,500
天啊
No!

367
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,560
这是我妹啊  泰德
That's my sister, Ted!

368
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,050
问题是  我又不知道
Well, look, I didn't know!

369
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,600
不光是我们  连你都是两年前才知道
None of us even knew you had a sister

370
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,580
你有个同父异母妹妹的
until two years ago, including you!

371
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,560
这不过是奇怪的巧合罢了
This is just some crazy coincidence.

372
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,830
整个纽约市整整4百万女人
There are four million women in the city of New York,

373
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,410
泰德你就偏偏睡了我妹妹
Ted, and you sleep with my sister?

374
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,190
-上天你为什么要这样对我  -我哪知道
- Why would the universe do that to me? - I don't know.

375
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,950
你又没有视女人如弃履过
It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way

376
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,330
"不应该"会招来天谴报应呀
that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.

377
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,360
你睡了我妹妹
You banged my sister!

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,170
我可爱的  幼嫩的  无辜的
My sweet, little, innocent...

379
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,390
-她有穿环  -真的吗  在哪里
- Pierced. - Really? Where?

380
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,160
别告诉我  
Don't answer that!

381
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,810
现在我知道昨晚我怎么会
Now I know why I felt everything

382
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,320
感应到你对她干的好事了
you did to her last night.

383
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,180
不是什么兄弟感应  是兄妹感应啊
It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!

384
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,110
我的天
Oh, my God.

385
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,980
泰德  你有没有
Ted... did you...

386
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,630
超厉害的
Big-time.

387
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,990
有你的  击掌相庆
Nice! High five!

388
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,160
不  等一下
Wait! No! No!

389
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,590
收回击掌
Retraction five!

390
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,000
是你哭着求我帮你上了她的
Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang.

391
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,580
既然我们提到家人这个问题了
And while we're on the subject of family,

392
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,170
我知道你还睡过我妈呢  
I'm pretty sure you banged my mom--

393
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,330
妈妈比妹妹严重多了
mom beats sister.

394
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,580
我才没有睡过你妈呢
I never banged your mom.

395
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,320
你刚刚又眨眼了
You just did the winking thing again!

396
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,920
我没有
No, I didn't.

397
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,290
好吧  巴尼  我问你
Fine. Hey, Barney, let me ask you something.

398
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,550
你今天早上有感觉到酸痛吗
Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?

399
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,930
尤其是...
Especially...

400
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,170
友谊到此为止
Friendship over!

401
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,510
好爽
Oh, yeah.

402
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,420
谁是你的吉他兼摩托车手  
Who's your guitar-player-biker-

403
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,440
找不到微辣莎莎酱
who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa-

404
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,220
骂句去你的  然后买中辣酱的坏男孩啊 
but-said-screw-it- and-went-medium bad boy?

405
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,050
马修  你的手
Marshall, your hand!

406
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,240
<i>好吧  我肯定没有肿成那样</i>
<i>Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad,</i>

407
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,970
<i>但马修叔叔讲这件事时总喜欢说成这样</i>
<i>but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story.</i>

408
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,480
没事  都是护腕弄的
Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff.

409
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,700
我晕乎乎的  而且也动不了指头
I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers...

410
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,780
死鱼的臭味也越来越浓了
...and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger.

411
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,510
但我在学着使用左手
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.

412
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:14,600
所以说昨晚我要你双掌袭胸
Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me

413
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,730
结果你只是一只手上吗
you only honka'd me?

414
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,150
我没想到你会注意到
I didn't think you noticed.

415
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,100
左咪咪嫉妒右咪咪一整天了呢
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.

416
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,560
取下护腕吧
Just take the cuff off.

417
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,890
不  宝贝  这样我们就没机会享性福了
No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop.

418
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,450
马修  你不需要戴护腕来让我觉得你性感
Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy.

419
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,890
你只需要冲我微笑
All you have to do is smile,

420
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,720
我就准备好让你扑上来了
and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop.

421
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,720
hop on Pop是著名儿童读物  字面意为跳到爸爸身上来

422
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,130
谢谢  宝贝
Thanks, baby.

423
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,990
你这么晕还能不能坚持最后做一次
Are you too woozy to do it one last time

424
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,130
然后再去看急诊呢
before we seek emergency medical attention?

425
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,420
只有试了才能知道啊
Only one way to find out.

426
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:53,350
抱歉  兄弟  我的反应太过了
I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted.

427
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,110
你觉得呢  我真不敢相信
You think? I can't believe

428
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,120
快递公司居然接受你的死负鼠
you're allowed to ship a dead possum.

429
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,740
它死了吗
He died?

430
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:02,050
那只负鼠可是我抛给你的橄榄枝[和平]
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.

431
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,250
你确定它不是在装死吗[负鼠的强项]
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?

432
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,470
它的味道和马修的手一个味儿
He smells like Marshall's hand.

433
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,240
等等  你原谅我了吗
And wait, you-you forgive me?

434
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,840
当然了  我有两根上好雪茄
Absolutely. Hey, I got a couple "Cee-gars."

435
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,330
过来吧
Get over here!

436
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,540
好啦  雪茄拿出来吧  
All right. So, where are those "Cee-gars"?

437
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,500
稍后奉上
Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute.

438
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,090
巴哥
Hey, Barn.

439
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,810
泰德
Ted?

440
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,960
巴尼  你妹妹怎么来了
Barney, what is your sister doing here?

441
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,970
没什么  兄弟  或者我该称呼你为
Nothing, bro. Or should I say,

442
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,280
妹夫
bro-in-law!

443
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,140
恭喜
Congratulations!

444
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,740
你现在要娶我妹妹
You're marrying my sister!

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,180
而且你得不惜血本办婚礼  你这个疯子
And you spared no expense, you big crazy!

446
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,110
知道吗  我爱巴尼
You know what? I love Barney,

447
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,620
但戒指的事太令人沮丧了
but this ring thing sucks.

448
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,230
有个恶心的家伙碰到我的胸
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack

449
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,550
然后向我道歉
and then apologized.

450
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,350
而且我觉得他是真心道歉呢
And I think he really, really meant it.

451
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:04,690
亲爱的  被陌生人袭胸是件很美滋滋的事
Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers,

452
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,590
但没什么比得上那个特别的人
but nothing beats the rush you get

453
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,490
注视你时带给你的悸动
when that one special person looks at you.

454
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,870
真的
It's true.

455
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,560
比如说现在在这个酒吧  我只看得见一个人
Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see,

456
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,780
她的面容比世界上任何人
and I see her brighter and more clearly

457
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,200
还要更亮更清晰
than anything else in this world.

458
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,620
知道这是什么吗
You know what that is?

459
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,430
是爱情
That's love.

460
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,300
也有可能是酒精
And possibly alcohol

461
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,120
与非常强效的抗生素产生的效果
mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.

462
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,750
巴尼就是这样看你
And that's how Barney sees you.

463
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,310
我知道你也是这样看巴尼
And I know that's how you see Barney.

464
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,080
婚礼仪式就从
I'd like to start the service

465
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
泰德梦境日记中截选的一段开始
with a passage from Ted's dream journal.

466
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,810
"溺水
"Drowning.

467
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,160
渴望空气
Gasping for air.

468
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,330
无处可逃"
No escape."

469
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,430
你梦到了越战吗
Wait, is that about Vietnam?

470
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,850
他梦到了全食超市
It's about Whole Foods.

471
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,850
全美最大天然有机食品零售商

472
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,700
巴尼  我们不会结婚的
Barney. We are not getting married.

473
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,850
超市的过道太窄了
And those aisles are too narrow!

474
00:18:59,100 --> 00:18:59,960
但你们两个必须结婚
But you two have to get married--

475
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,970
否则  你们之间就只是一次廉价
otherwise, it's just a cheap,

476
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,270
无意义  恶心的一夜情
meaningless, disgusting one-night stand.

477
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,450
等等  说清楚下  你是说你反对
Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed

478
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,900
廉价  无意义  恶心的一夜情吗
to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?

479
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,000
是的
Yes.

480
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,390
巴尼  你没明白吗
Barney... don't you see?

481
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,190
你戒瘾成功了
Your detox is done!

482
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,470
你已经戒掉"一夜情瘾"了
You're over one-night stands!

483
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,090
我的天  你说对了
Oh, my God, you're right!

484
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,370
-我自由了  -对
- I'm free! - Yeah.

485
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,800
所以如果你想想  别想得太深刻
So if you think about it-- but not too much--

486
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,450
卡莉和我上床其实是件好事
it's actually good that Carly and I hooked up.

487
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,100
是啊  非常好
Yeah, it's really good.

488
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,060
他的表现就像他还是五十多岁一样
I mean, this guy goes at it like he's still in his 50s.

489
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,970
来根雪茄吧  你这个大疯子
Hey, have a cigar, you big crazy!

490
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,930
别想糊弄过去
Hey, don't try to make this okay.

491
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,620
你还是跟我妹妹上床了
You still slept with my sister.

492
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,950
向我保证你永远不会再这样做
Promise me you will never, ever do that again.

493
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,790
我保证
I promise.

494
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,260
你刚刚眨眼了
You just winked.

495
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,070
我没有
No, I didn't.

496
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,190
-你又眨了  -我没有
- You did it again! - No, I didn't!

497
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,050
你可以保证  对吗
You swear, right?

498
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,070
对  当然了
Yeah. Of course.

499
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>那天晚上</i>
<i>That night,</i>

500
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,760
<i>虽然罗宾依然无法拿到啤酒</i>
<i>even though she still couldn't get a beer,</i>

501
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,730
<i>但她了解到戒指的真正魔力</i>
<i>Robin realized the true power of the ring.</i>

502
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,410
罗宾
Hey, Robin.

503
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,920
你弄清楚怎么在订婚的情况下
Did you ever figure out how you're gonna get

504
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,610
从吧台那里拿到喝的了吗
a drink at the bar now that you're engaged?

505
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,700
当然  我知道一个永远有效的方法
Oh, sure. I know a way that's gonna last forever.

506
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,940
威士忌加冰
Scotch on the rocks?

507
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,560
马上来
Coming right up.

508
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,330
在你们对帽子发表看法之前
Now, before you say anything about the hat...

509
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,340
这位妹子的屁屁真是太赞了
this new girl's ass is phenomenal!

510
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,150
马修  你得看看这个
Hey, Marshall, you got to see this.

511
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,250
网购肯定弄混了我的订单
The catalog must have mixed up my order.

512
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,370
你不会相信他们寄给我什么样的牛仔裤
You won't believe the jeans they just sent me.

513
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,980
真滑稽  对吗
Hilarious, right?

514
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,460
绝对的
Totally.

515
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,740
你看起来像是
You look like some

516
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,970
郊区妈妈  开着迷你面包车
suburban mom who drives a minivan

517
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,730
车上全是变味儿的麦圈和空果汁盒
filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes...

518
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,540
有可能
probably makes

519
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,290
用辣椒通心粉和玉米馅饼做晚餐
chili mac and Frito pie for dinner...

520
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,150
车上全是薄荷烟的味道  
smells like that menthol cigarette that

521
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,780
她在等着孩子们
she snuck while she was waiting to

522
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,680
冰球训练时  偷偷在车上抽的
pick her kids up from hockey practice.

523
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,050
快过来
Get over here!
