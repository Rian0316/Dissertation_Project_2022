我就说一星期12先令

一间小的起居室和卧室

68
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,045
他说愿意付一星期3镑

69
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,596

这没什么 大多数房客都有
That's all right most of my lodgers have them

75
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:12,119
但他要求完全一个人
but he was to be left entirely to himself

76
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,746
决不能被打扰
and never on any account to be disturbed.

77
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:18,415
这也没什么奇怪的
Well, there's nothing very wonderful about that.

78
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,968
算不上个理由 可这又是根本没有道理的

他住进来有10天了

我们把饭放在他门口的椅子上
We put them on a chair outside his door.

94
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:57,420
要是他还需要些什么的话

101
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,564
为了隐瞒他的笔迹
Well, to conceal his handwriting.

可能和订房间的人不是同一个人了

Possibly.

154
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,143
但这解释不了房客的举动
Well, it doesn't explain the lodge's behavior.

155
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:09,354
举动?
Behavior?

156
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:11,838
什么举动?
What behavior?

157
00:11:15,459 --> 00:11:17,747
你怎么知道这儿的?
How do you know this address?

158
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:20,494
从福尔摩斯先生那里
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

159
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:22,756
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

160
00:11:22,836 --> 00:11:26,382
他总是保留着他过去委托人的相关记录
He always keeps a record of his past clients.

161
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:28,292
要是福尔摩斯要问我的话
But if Holmes has something to ask

162
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:29,956
为什么他不亲自来
why does he not come himself,

163
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,114
为什么派你来 华生医生?
why send you, Dr. Watson?

164
00:11:32,195 --> 00:11:36,749
我偶尔也自己行动
Well, I do on occasion act for myself.

165
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,190
恐怕我帮不了你
Well, I cannot help you I'm afraid.

166
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,421
我对Warren太太的这个房客一无所知
I know nothing of this lodger of Mrs. Warren's.

167
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,827
他是不是你的一个同乡
Is he perhaps a fellow countryman of yours

168
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:48,927
刚从美国来 需要帮助?
recently arrived from America in need of help?

169
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,108
那你告诉福尔摩斯我就在这里 如果他需要我的话
Then tell him I'm here if he needs me.

170
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:53,561
只能说这么多了
That is all I can say.

171
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,233
失陪了
Excuse me,

172

<i>("纽约时报" 意大利商人命丧布鲁克林)</i>

现在我得去工作了
I must go to work now.

174
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:01,894
可能是Warren太太需要帮助
It may be that Mrs. Warren needs help.

175
00:12:01,976 --> 00:12:03,743
这个男人在打扰她的家庭
The man is disturbing her household.

176
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,737
为什么 他做了什么了?
Why, what does he do to them?

177
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,149
这个案子更主要是关于他没有做什么
Well, it's more a case of what he doesn't do.

178
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,035
他从早到晚从不露面
He doesn't appear from dawn till dusk.

179
00:12:10,117 --> 00:12:12,495
他的饮食留在门外
He has his meals on a tray left outside the door.

180
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:14,952
如果他是一个亡命之徒
If he's a fugitive from justice

181
00:12:15,022 --> 00:12:17,025
我们应该把他交给警察
we should turn him over to the police.

182
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:18,825
警察?
Police?

183
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:22,296
不 不
No, no.

184
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,549
再见 妈妈
Caio Mama.

185
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:37,299
如果有什么问题的话
If there is a problem,

186
00:12:37,568 --> 00:12:39,659
福尔摩斯知道在哪里找我
Holmes knows where to find me

187
00:12:39,898 --> 00:12:41,348
在剧院 别来这里
at the theatre not here,

188
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,248
别再来这里了 医生 你听明白了么?
never here Doctor, do you understand?

189
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,109
在这行当 你树了不少敌人吧
You have enemies in your line of work.

190
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,714
每个人都有敌人 不管他们是干什么的
Everyone has enemies whatever they do,

191
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,625
真实的生活就是这样
is that not true of life.

192
00:12:52,424 --> 00:12:54,156
但有些人冒的风险更高
But some are more at risk than others

193
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,034
由于他们的信念
with their beliefs

194
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:58,815
和他们的勇气
and their courage.

195
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:01,598
我做我该做的 医生
I do what I do, Doctor,

196
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:04,773
别要求我做一个圣徒
don't make me out to be a saint.

197
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,896

我今早不该去找他的

紧接着Firmani被谋杀了
And then Firmani is murdered

273
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:20,462
是因为不肯说出这个藏身之处
rather than give away the hiding place.

274
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,966
不 不
No, no.

275

甚至写一封信都可能被截获

那么他是怎么收到外面的消息?

有什么事 福尔摩斯先生?

321
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,840
可能会是个陷阱 来引那个人出去?

322
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:39,758
不大可能
Unlikely.

323
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:42,312
我们是不是该把已经知道的 红圈会的事告诉警察

00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:43,838
告诉警察?

福尔摩斯先生 医生 你最好快一点

应该交给警察 福尔摩斯先生

请泡一壶茶 Hudson太太

I'm at the end of my patience when it comes to knocking my old man about.

339
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:23,760
谁要伤害他?

340
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:25,875
我要是知道就好了
I wish I knew that.

341

好的

347
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,849
小心点 福尔摩斯 他心脏不太好
Take care, Holmes, his heart.

00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:51,351
你来说说吧 Warren先生

我出门还没有走上10步

那些人

359
00:23:20,128 --> 00:23:21,681
你有没有看清他们的长相?

360
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:25,207
没有 先生 好像是变魔术一样 我被抓进去
No, sir, I was picked up as if by magic

361
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,451

其中一个用意大利语赌咒发誓

366
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:44,440
钱可不是万能的
Money is not everything.

367
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:47,691
我今天就要把他给赶出去 就在今天
I'll have him out of here before the day is done.

368
00:23:47,995 --> 00:23:50,544
我想见见你的这个房客

很明显他的敌人们弄错了

这样G就可以进到那里去

00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:53,168
福尔摩斯 我觉得我们应该通知苏格兰场

我们在监视

让我们看看房子后面有什么吧
Let's see what lies behind these lodgings.

他就是喜欢小题大做
He just likes a fuss made of him.

393
00:27:15,978 --> 00:27:17,602
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

之后就再没有见过他

00:27:36,692 --> 00:27:38,079
你说是一个外国绅士

我们可以签个合同

412
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,929
住着我们焦虑的女士
our agitated lady.

413
00:28:06,564 --> 00:28:08,545
只需要再等几个小时
Only a few more hours to wait

414
00:28:08,617 --> 00:28:09,887
就会发信号

黄昏之后 G
After dusk, G.

416
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,479
一切都符合为爱私奔的条件
It has all the makings of some love escapade.

417
00:28:20,272 --> 00:28:21,630
爱?

418
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:25,984
爱或许是这件事的根源
Love may be at the root of it

419
00:28:27,266 --> 00:28:29,321
但她的脸
but her face,

420
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:31,240

来伦敦避难

424

为了躲避某种威胁
from some instant and terrible fear.

425
00:28:41,982 --> 00:28:44,942
丈夫为了最大限度保证妻子的安全
The man desires her utmost safety

426
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:47,651
而采用如此原始的方式
and arranges to communicate

427
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:49,525
来进行联络
in such original fashion

428
00:28:49,563 --> 00:28:53,396
甚至是女房东 也不知道房客已经换人了
for not even the landlady knows of the substitution.

429
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:57,678
字条是用印刷体写的 以防有人通过笔迹认出来
And there's printed messages to prevent the fact that she's a woman

430
00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:00,232
房客是一个女人

431
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,142
看

432
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:06,336
蜡烛和火柴

他们的信号

434
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,340
现在其实没这个必要
But there's no need for this now surely,

435
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,171
就不能直接让他们见面么?
can't we just simply bring them together?

436
00:29:15,243 --> 00:29:17,247
你能保证我们能一直保护他们
And guarantee that we'd protect them forever

437
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:18,930
免遭红圈会的毒手么?
from the Red Circle?

438
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,230
不能
No.

439
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:23,684
我们得让他们继续这么下去
We must let them play this thing out.

440
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,046
我先回贝克街
I must return briefly to Baker Street.

441
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,923
你能不能找个借口留在公寓?
Do you have reason enough to stay in the lodgings?

442
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,109
就说是为了Warren先生的健康
Mr. Warren's health gives me every excuse.

443
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:37,477
或许我有必要把你的左轮手枪带来
It might be advisable for me to bring back your revolver.

444
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:39,520
不用 我已经带着了
No need to man, I have it.

445
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:40,882
好极了
Good, splendid.

446
00:29:48,956 --> 00:29:50,598
我们一小时后见

447
00:29:56,367 --> 00:30:00,399
Hawkins 希望到头来有情人终相聚

448
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:02,724
我会主持正义的 福尔摩斯先生
I'll do you this justice, Mr. Holmes.

449
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,742
我办案子的时候只要是跟您合作
I was never in a case yet

450
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,016
就没有一次觉的不踏实
I didn't feel stronger for having you on my side.

451
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:10,861
逃亡的人可能是Gennaro和Emilia Lucca
Fugitives may be Gennaro and Emilia Lucca

452
00:30:10,897 --> 00:30:12,937
如果是这样 那他们处境危险
if so in grave danger,

453
00:30:12,974 --> 00:30:15,715
很需要我们协助
expect agent imminently.

我们被迫逃走 我们的朋友还是难逃一死

574
00:40:39,274 --> 00:40:42,820
不止一次 侦查行动的作用有限

得等待那些无法预知的事发生

00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:05,198
他丈夫发出的暗号
for her husband's signal.

617
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:06,858
什么暗号 福尔摩斯先生?
What signal, Mr. Holmes?

618
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:19,420
Leverton 灯
Leverton, the lamp.

619
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:25,356
这么说Gennaro Lucca就在那儿?
So Gennaro Lucca is over there now?

620
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,261
还没有 但我想他会来的
Not yet but he will be I hope.

621
00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:30,030
当我到伦敦的时候 我也找不到Lucca
I couldn't find Lucca when I got to London.

622
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,650
我们通过Enrico Firmani进行联系
My contact was Enrico Firmani

623
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:34,567
但那家伙找到了他
but the brute reached him first

624
00:43:34,604 --> 00:43:37,936
在杀死他之前肯定也让他开口了
and he must have made him talk before killing him.

625
00:43:37,973 --> 00:43:40,459
我们是不是该上楼去看看Lucca夫人?
Shall we not go upstairs to reassure Mrs. Lucca?

626
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:41,947
她不会让我们进到房间里去的 华生
She won't admit us, Watson.

627
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,595
她现在只听她丈夫的
She'll only answer to her husband.

628
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:47,404
噢 看哪 是Hawkins
Oh, look, Hawkins

629
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,964
不是很显眼
not too conspicuous.

630
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:53,754
对 Hawkins警督 他看来来很能干
Yes, Inspector Hawkins, he seems an able fellow.

631
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:55,960
是苏格兰场最好的一个
One of Scotland Yard's finest.

632
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:57,844
业务熟练
He knows his business.

633
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:16,971
先生们
Gentlemen,

634
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:21,751
Gennaro Lucca刚刚进来
Gennaro Lucca has just gone in.

635
00:44:22,808 --> 00:44:24,270
目前为止一切顺利
So far so good.

636
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,388
夫人是在红圈会计划要杀掉Castallote
Mrs. Lucca came to us

637
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:29,140
那天晚上来找我们的
the night the Red Circle planned to kill Castallote.

638
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:33,193
他们已经杀掉了他的合伙人Zamba
They'd already murdered his partner Zamba.

639
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:36,236
我们设法把团伙成员一网打尽
We managed to round up most of the gang

640
00:44:36,273 --> 00:44:40,089
但那个Black Gorgiano漏网了
but Black Gorgiano slipped the net.

641
00:44:41,665 --> 00:44:43,264
一听说他来英国
When we heard he'd left for England,

642
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:45,921
我也就尽快赶来了
I followed after him fast as I could.

643
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,628
我和苏格兰场取得了联系
I got in touch with Scotland Yard

644
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:51,322
他却没有踪影了
but he'd gone to ground.

645
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:54,546
开始发出暗号了 是什么意思?
There's a single light, what does it mean?

646
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:56,812
两个灯光
Two lights.

647
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:03,712
-消失了 -不 又有了
-Gone. -No, no, there it is again.

648
00:46:06,903 --> 00:46:10,893
缓慢的闪三下
Three lights measured slow.

649
00:46:12,122 --> 00:46:14,468
他要说什么 到底什么意思?
What's he saying, what does it mean?

650
00:46:14,871 --> 00:46:15,736
没什么意思
Nothing,

651
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,620
没什么
nothing.

652
00:46:18,281 --> 00:46:21,453
但他下一步肯定是要确认一下
But his next actions must confirm it.

653
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:26,015
他肯定是来这里等她
He must come here to collect her.

654
00:46:33,136 --> 00:46:34,474
又消失了
It's gone.

655
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,543
收到消息了
The message received.

656
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:37,649
什么消息?
But what message?

657
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,241
Gennaro
Gennaro.

658
00:46:46,948 --> 00:46:50,804
我最好的朋友
My dearest friend in all the world,

659
00:46:52,515 --> 00:46:56,974
和兄弟会的叛徒
and betrayer of the brotherhood.

660
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:01,739
这不是在发信号 有个人跟他在一起
There's no message there's somebody with him.

661
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,024
华生?
Watson?

662
00:47:06,118 --> 00:47:07,470
你听到了么 福尔摩斯?
Did you hear that, Holmes?

663
00:47:07,544 --> 00:47:09,168
是的 危险
Yeah, danger.

664
00:47:09,249 --> 00:47:12,024
天哪 看 她跑出来了 跑到街上了
My God, look she's out there on the street.

665
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:13,347
华生
Watson.

666
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:35,962
Hawkins 你要抓的人在那
Hawkins Your murderer is up there.

667
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:38,091
不可能 这只有一个入口
Impossible, there's only one entrance.

668
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:39,655
等一下 他是我的人 Hawkins
Just a minute he's mine, Hawkins,

669
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:41,184
-我来负责 -不 你不能 先生
-I'll take responsibility. -No you won't sir,

670
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:43,802
伦敦的事由伦敦警方负责
London dangers are up to the London force.

671
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:47,444
Gennaro
Gennaro.

672
00:48:07,942 --> 00:48:09,495
Emilia
Emilia.

673
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:23,704
华生 带他们离开这个恐怖的地方
Watson, take them away from this horror.

674
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:54,217
请把船票给我 先生
I'll take those tickets, sir.

675
00:48:55,816 --> 00:48:59,329
求求你 我们的船黎明时起锚
Please, our ship sales at dawn.

676
00:49:07,505 --> 00:49:09,314
你打算把它怎么办 警督?
What are you going to do with him, Inspector?

677
00:49:09,627 --> 00:49:12,377
他将被逮捕 并以谋杀Gorgiano的罪名被指控
He'll be arrested and tried for the murder of Gorgiano,

678
00:49:12,415 --> 00:49:14,088
法律就是法律
that is the law.

679
00:49:14,742 --> 00:49:17,497
我不知道你们英国的法律会怎么对他
Well, I don't know what your British law may be

680
00:49:17,535 --> 00:49:19,110
但我想要是在纽约
but I guess that in New York,

681
00:49:19,147 --> 00:49:22,888
这位女士的丈夫会收到很多的感谢信
this lady's husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks.

682
00:49:25,249 --> 00:49:27,996
这世上没有哪一个法官 会给这个男人判刑
There's not a judge on earth that will condemn this man.

683
00:49:28,504 --> 00:49:31,444
我想Lucca夫妇没有什么好担心的
I don't think Mr. And Mrs. Lucca have too much to fear

684
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:33,670
但我们还是得遵守法律程序
but we have to go through the procedures.

685
00:49:34,573 --> 00:49:35,994
带他们下楼
Take them downstairs.

686
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:44,994
要是你一个人在这里 福尔摩斯先生
No doubt if you'd been here on your own, Mr. Holmes,

687
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:47,239
你会有不同的解决方法吧
you'd have found a different solution.

688
00:49:47,515 --> 00:49:50,175
我们生活在法律之下 警督
The law is what we live with, Inspector.

689
00:49:51,097 --> 00:49:56,719
但有的时候正义更难实现
Justice is sometimes harder to achieve.

690
00:49:57,466 --> 00:49:59,665
我还是不明白 你是怎么一开始
What I still don't understand is how you came to be mixed up

691
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:00,934
就卷到这件事里来的
in all this in the first place.

692
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:02,960
晚安警督
Good night, Inspector.

693
00:50:04,229 --> 00:50:05,929
晚安 福尔摩斯先生
Good night, Mr. Holmes.

694
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,599
<i>看来英国的司法 对这对年轻夫妇很友善</i>
<i>English justice looked kindly on the young couple</i>

695
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:43,345
<i>不久 他们就去了澳大利亚</i>
<i>and soon afterwards they left for Australia.</i>

696
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:46,824
<i>在那里终于摆脱了红圈会的威胁</i>
<i>There they found a new and happier life</i>

697
00:50:46,904 --> 00:50:50,242
<i>过着新的幸福生活</i>
<i>free from the threat of the Red Circle.</i>

698
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:59,779
