00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,725
卖报 卖报
Paper, paper.

5
00:02:57,868 --> 00:02:59,317
成了
Finished.

6
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,574
华生 你对它有什么看法?
What do you make of it Watson?

7
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:13,917
嗯?
Huh?

8
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,443
我想你后脑勺上一定长眼睛了吧 福尔摩斯
I believe you got eyes in the back of your head Holmes.

9
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,285
我眼前放着一个擦得锃亮的咖啡壶
Well I have a well-polished coffee pot in front of me.

10
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,946
哈德森太太说是昨晚你出门时
Mrs. Hudson said it was left last night

11
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:23,852
有人落下的
while you were out.

12
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,665
你对它有什么看法?
What do you make of it?

13
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,054
我想
Well

14
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:32,147
至少我们知道了他的名字
his name at least we know.

15
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:38,219
我认为 摩梯末医生是一位功成名就
I think Dr. Mortimer is a successful,

16
00:03:38,257 --> 00:03:40,578
年岁较大的杏林人士
elderly medical man,

17
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,469
受人尊敬
well esteemed,

18
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,831
认识他的人们送给他
since those who know him gave him

19
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,065
这件表示感激的纪念品
this mark of their appreciation.

20
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:48,119
没错
Yeah.

21
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,554
我还认为他是位乡村医生
I think he's a country practitioner,

22
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:53,195
出诊时大多是步行的
does a good deal of his visiting on foot.

23
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,944
'C.C.H.的朋友们'
'Friends of the C.C.H.'

24
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,189
我猜可能是当地的猎人会 (打猎的首字母为H)
I should guess that to be the local hunt.

25
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:03,419
哦好啊 好极了 华生
Oh bravo, bravo Watson.

26
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
你知道 我不能不说
You know I am bound to say

27
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:08,328
你已经习惯性地低估自己的能力了
you habitually underrate your abilities.

28
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:13,760
也许你本身并不能发光
It may be that you are not yourself luminous,

29
00:04:13,798 --> 00:04:16,133
但你是光的传导者
but you are a conductor of light.

30
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:20,112
有些人本身并不是天才
Some people without possessing genius

31
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:22,340
却有着可观的激发天才的力量
have remarkable power for stimulating it.

32
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,774
我得说 我亲爱的伙伴
I confess, my dear fellow,

33
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,692
我真是太感谢你了
that I am very much in your debt.

34
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,554
谢谢
Thank you.

35
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:34,260
但是 我恐怕
But I'm afraid that

36
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:36,935
你的大多数结论都是错误的
most of your conclusions were erroneous.

37
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:39,838
'H'
'H'?

38
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:42,753
肯定指的是"医院" (医院也是H打头)
Surely hospital.

39
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:45,367
'C.C.'应该是查林十字会 (Charing Cross)
'C.C.' suggests Charing Cross.

40
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:48,036
在我的推理中 这是一个年轻人
I mean if so I would postulate a young man

41
00:04:48,074 --> 00:04:50,594
不到三十岁 和蔼可亲
under thirty, amiable,

42
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,351
做事马马虎虎
absent-minded,

43
00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:54,658
不追求功名
unambitious

44
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,727
还养了一条狗
and the possessor of a dog.

45
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:58,225
能给我看看手杖吗?
Can I see the stick?

46
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,837
谢谢
Thank you.

47
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,547
养的狗比梗犬大
Larger than a terrier,

48
00:05:11,826 --> 00:05:14,635
比獒犬要小
smaller than a mastiff.

49
00:05:28,142 --> 00:05:29,865
我是对的
I was right,

50
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:32,983
是一只卷毛的斯班尼犬
a curly haired spaniel.

51
00:05:35,926 --> 00:05:37,276
摩梯末医生?
Dr. Mortimer?

52
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:38,635
太感谢您了 先生
Thank you sir.

53
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:40,020
谢谢您
Thank you.

54
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:41,672
我不敢肯定是把它落在了这里
I wasn't sure whether I left it here

55
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,967
还是忘在了轮渡公司
or at the shipping office.

56
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:44,523
S.S.直布罗陀号
The S. S. Gibraltar

57
00:05:44,563 --> 00:05:48,203
今天到了特伯利的码头
you see docks today at Tewberry.

58
00:05:50,107 --> 00:05:52,846
我对您很感兴趣 福尔摩斯先生
You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes.

59
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:56,410
我真想不到会看见如此长的头骨
I had hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull

60
00:05:56,448 --> 00:05:59,988
和这么深陷的眼窝
or such well-marked supra-orbital development.

61
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,618
您不反对我用手指
Would you have any objection to my running

62
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,078
沿着您的头顶骨缝摸一摸吧?
my finger along your parietal fissure?

63
00:06:04,116 --> 00:06:06,188
得了吧 摩梯末医生
Please Dr. Mortimer.

64
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:07,665
在没有得到您头骨的实物之前 先生
A cast of your skull, sir,

65
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,097
如果能拥有它的模型该多好
until the original becomes available.

66
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,218
我并不想讨人厌
It is not my intention to be fulsome,

67
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:18,043
但我得承认 我实在很觊觎您的头骨
but I confess that I covet your skull.

68
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:21,136
您还是乖乖坐下吧 摩梯末医生
Behave and sit down Dr. Mortimer.

69
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,408
好孩子
Good boy.

70
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:31,492
好吧 我想您今天赏光来贝克街
Well I presume that it was not your phrenological passion,

71
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:33,556
恐怕不是为了研究我的头骨吧?
which drew you to Baker Street?

72
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:36,876
很可惜 确实不是
Unfortunately it was not sir.

73
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:37,980
斑斑
Spot.

74
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:40,911
我这里...
I have here...

75
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,132
我这里有一份传说的手稿
I have here the statement of a certain legend,

76
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,653
在巴斯克维尔家族流传着
which runs in the Baskerville family.

77
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:48,222
巴斯克维尔?
Baskerville?

78
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:52,010
是的 我是查尔斯・巴斯克维尔爵士的遗嘱执行人
Yeah, I'm an executor of Sir Charles Baskerville's will

79
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:53,765
这是在他的文件里发现的
and found it amongst his papers.

80
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:56,332
这件事关系到修果・巴斯克维尔
It concerns Hugo Baskerville;

81
00:06:56,371 --> 00:06:59,153
他是个庄园主 也是达特姆尔高原上的恶棍
he was Lord of the manor, Grimpen on Dartmoor.

82
00:06:59,191 --> 00:06:59,991
达特姆尔高原?
Dartmoor?

83
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:02,094
两百多年前的事了
Some 200 years ago.

84
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,374
这份文件的年代在那之后
The document is somewhat later.

85
00:07:08,153 --> 00:07:09,484
"得知此事后
"Learn then from this story

86
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:11,833
将来定要小心慎行
to be circumspect in the future,

87
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:13,878
以免我们家族过去所尝到的深重痛苦
that those foul passions whereby

88
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:16,739
由于我们这些后代的败落
our family has suffered may not be loosed

89
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:19,673
而重新降临
again to our comparable ruin,

90
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:22,199
1742年11月8日"
8th of November 1742," was it?

91
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,365
这序言真吸引人 是不是?
Intriguing preamble.

92
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:28,083
我在报上看到过 查尔斯・巴斯克维尔爵士的死讯
I've read of Sir Charles Baskerville's death.

93
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:30,439
从医学角度来说
From a medical point of view

94
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:32,498
真没报道出什么内容
it was a poorly informed article.

95
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:33,775
不用了 谢谢
No thank you.

96
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:38,262
他死于呼吸困难和心脏衰竭
He died of dyspnea and cardiac exhaustion.

97
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:39,190
这两个症状是连锁出现的
Were the conditions linked

98
00:07:39,227 --> 00:07:39,875
还是同时出现的?
or were they parallel?

99
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:41,434
依我看来 症状是连锁出现的
Oh they were linked in my opinion.

100
00:07:41,471 --> 00:07:46,739
他的面部有些...有些扭曲变形
There was some, some facial distortion.

101
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:49,496
可以推测是心绞痛引起的吗?
Caused by the cardiac pain presumably?

102
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:50,634
可以
Yes.

103
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,791
听你的口气好像有点怀疑啊
You sound doubtful.

104
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:55,887
那面孔可不是一般的扭曲变形
It was not merely facial distortion.

105
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:57,134
这里写着 在1692年
Well here in 1692

106
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:59,879
修果・巴斯克维尔掳走了一个年轻姑娘
Hugo Baskerville abducted a young girl

107
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:04,778
但是她穿过沼泽逃了出去
but she escaped across the moor

108
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,949
在一个诅咒之夜
at night cursing.

109
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,770
他把犬舍里的狗都放出来去追她
He unkenneled his pack of hounds

110
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:15,792
就像狩猎一只小动物一样
and hunted her down like a wild animal.

111
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,404
当他那另三个醉醺醺的狐朋狗友赶到时
When his 3 drunken companions followed,

112
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:26,003
只见那姑娘已深陷沼泽
they found the girl in a deep dip or goyal

113
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:30,094
因为过度疲惫和惊恐而死
dead from fear and fatigue.

114
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,597
她丧命的原因是
And it also confronted the cause of her death,

115
00:08:33,636 --> 00:08:37,735
一只巨大的恶魔般的猎犬
a huge, demonic hound.

116
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:39,665
他们目睹了
Even as they looked

117
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:43,355
猎犬撕扯着修果・巴斯克维尔的喉咙
the hound tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville.

118
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:47,519
其中一个当晚就被吓死了
One companion died that very night of what he saw,

119
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:50,254
剩下的两个也被吓得精神失常
and the other twain were broken men

120
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,494
终身都成了废人
for the rest of their days.

121
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:55,241
这个传说从那时起便一直萦绕着这个家族
The sound is supposed to have haunted the family since then

122
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,661
不祥的气氛始终笼罩着他们
to the general misfortune of the line.

123
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:01,404
这个故事
Well this may appeal

124
00:09:01,443 --> 00:09:05,136
倒是很对你那喜欢恐怖小说的胃口
to your lurid taste in fiction Watson.

125
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:08,900
这是个神话故事 先生
It's a fairy tale sir.

126
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,933
当然是的 福尔摩斯先生
Of course Mr. Holmes

127
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,538
但如果其中没有一点事实的话
but fairy tales would not survive

128
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:14,092
也不会流传这么久
without a kernel of truth.

129
00:09:15,745 --> 00:09:18,070
查尔斯爵士死去的那天晚上
On the night Sir Charles died

130
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:21,340
我在刚点灯的时间 就到了巴斯克维尔庄园
I arrived at Baskerville Hall at first light.

131
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,770
我要告诉你们我所看见的
I shall tell you what I found.

132
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:33,352
绝无添减
No more or less.

133
00:09:34,598 --> 00:09:36,231
这边走 先生
This way please sir?

134
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,898
我关注他的状况有一段时间了
I had been concerned about him for some time.

135
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,728
他对猎犬的传说
He had become obsessed

136
00:09:40,765 --> 00:09:41,967
深信不疑
with the Legend of the Hound.

137
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,773
在凉亭那边
It's by the summerhouse.

138
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,074
他坚信他听到过
He believed he had heard

139
00:09:46,113 --> 00:09:47,498
从沼泽传来的猎犬的吠声
the hound itself upon the moors,

140
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,280
他甚至坚信他看到过它
he even believed he had seen it.

141
00:09:53,404 --> 00:09:55,039
当时我认为这些可怕的幻想
At the time I took such morbid fancies

142
00:09:55,076 --> 00:09:56,315
正是查尔斯爵士
to be part and parcel

143
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:58,661
生理处于病态的部分表现
of Sir Charles' pathological condition.

144
00:09:59,088 --> 00:10:00,708
而现在呢?
And now?

145
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,658
我绝不会那么认为了
I no longer believe that to be the case.

146
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,126
在那里 先生
There sir.

147
00:10:06,165 --> 00:10:08,774
据我们所知没有人动过他 先生
We didn't like to move him sir. Once we knew.

148
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:12,443
好的 做得好 白瑞摩
Yes, Yes quite Barrymore.

149
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:17,844
这真是一场悲惨的意外 白瑞摩太太
A sad occasion Mrs. Barrymore

150
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,026
您一定彻夜未眠
an unhappy vigil for you.

151
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:22,938
他是我们的希望 医生
He was our hope doctor.

152
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:27,722
是这附近乡村所有人的希望
Hope for the country here about's.

153
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,921
他就是我们的全部世界
He brought the world to us.

154
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,064
是我们大家的希望
He was our hope.

155
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,436
在查尔斯爵士向小径跑去之前
Before Sir Charles ran up the alley

156
00:10:55,474 --> 00:10:57,185
他就站在门前
he had eloquently stood at the gate

157
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,038
至少站了十分钟
for at least ten minutes.

158
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,491
你怎么知道的?
How do you know that?

159
00:11:01,122 --> 00:11:03,712
他抽的雪茄掉了两次烟灰
The ash had dropped twice from his cigar

160
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:06,192
而且那里还有3根用过的火柴
and there were also 3 spent matches.

161
00:11:06,876 --> 00:11:08,599
您很出色 摩梯末医生
I'm impressed by Dr. Mortimer.

162
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,666
还有别的痕迹吗?
Was there anything else?

163
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:13,160
有
Yes.

164
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,678
莫非有脚印?
Footprints?

165
00:11:15,184 --> 00:11:16,758
男人的还是女人的?
A man or a woman's?

166
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,864
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

167
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:24,916
是只特大型的猎犬的爪印
they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.

168
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,246
许多人都曾在沼泽见过那只怪物
Several people have seen a creature upon the moor,

169
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:29,641
是只巨型的怪物 狰狞可怕
a huge creature, ghastly, and spectral.

170
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:31,418
我盘问过两个声称见过它的人
I've crossed examined 2 of them.

171
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,547
都是脚踏实地的老实庄稼人
Hardheaded countrymen both

172
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,660
描述的情形也都和传说对得上
and their stories tally.

173
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:38,097
希望您能告诉我
I want you to advise me what I should do

174
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:39,973
亨利・巴斯克维尔爵士应该怎么办呢
with Sir Henry Baskerville.

175
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:44,696
亨利・巴斯克维尔爵士原先生活在美国
Henry Baskerville has spent his life in America.

176
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:47,603
他乘坐S.S.直布罗陀号到这里
He has come over on the S. S. Gibraltar

177
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,054
有您亨利爵士乘坐客船 我们不胜荣幸
Been a pleasure having you aboard Sir Henry.

178
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:52,964
亨利爵士
Sir Henry,

179
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:55,784
这头衔我听着还不太习惯呢
I still haven't gotten used to that title.

180
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:58,070
还有别人有权继承查尔斯爵士的遗产吗?
Was there any other claim upon Sir Charles' estate?

181
00:11:58,315 --> 00:11:59,479
没有
None.

182
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:00,764
他最小的弟弟 罗杰
His youngest brother, Roger,

183
00:12:00,802 --> 00:12:03,019
因为黄热病死于中非
died in Central America of yellow fever

184
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,565
三十多年前的事了
some 30 years ago.

185
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,043
亨利爵士是巴斯克维尔家族最后的子嗣
Sir Henry is the last of the Baskerville's.

186
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,392
当时您为什么没有马上请我去调查?
Why did you not consult me immediately?

187
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:27,520
有的问题 就连最精明老练的侦探
There's a realm in which the most accomplished

188
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:28,966
也是毫无办法的
detective is helpless sir.

189
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:31,339
有些事物
There are certain things here,

190
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:32,874
虽然全然不符合自然规律
which are impossible to reconcile

191
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,092
可依旧存在着
to the settled order of nature.

192
00:12:36,454 --> 00:12:38,180
如果您认为这属于超自然的范畴
If you believe this to be supernatural

193
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:40,283
找个神父岂不是更好
you'll find more help from a priest.

194
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,240
不 不 不 不 不
No, No, No, No, No.

195
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:53,777
我怎样才能帮您呢?
How can I assist?

196
00:12:54,856 --> 00:12:57,259
得给我个说法
And I'll have an answer damn it.

197
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,051
他正为靴子的事发火呢 先生
He's in a stir sir about his boot.

198
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:09,309
搞什么啊 如果找不到我的旧黑靴 就要他好看
By thunder if that fellow can't find my old black boot.

199
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:11,673
您丢的是一只新的棕色靴子吧
Surely it was a new brown boot.

200
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,814
不 昨天晚上他们把棕色的那双拿走了
No last night they took one of the brown ones.

201
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:16,675
今天他们又偷走了一只黑的
Today they've sneaked one of the black.

202
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,506
很抱歉 摩梯末医生
I'm sorry Mortimer

203
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:19,427
很抱歉为这些琐事麻烦你
I'm sorry to trouble you with this nonsense

204
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:21,752
可这还是所谓第一流的旅店啊!
but this is a first class hotel damn it!

205
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,086
哦 你好
Oh hello.

206
00:13:24,123 --> 00:13:26,439
夏洛克・福尔摩斯为您效劳
Mr. Sherlock Holmes at your service.

207
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:28,321
我倒觉得这件事
I think it is worth troubling about

208
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,526
很值得讨论
as a matter of fact.

209
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:32,783
您何出此言?
You do why?

210
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,822
因为这件事不合常理
Because it's inexplicable.

211
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,858
好
Good.

212
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,140
很好
That's good.

213
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:50,996
老天
My God.

214
00:13:51,035 --> 00:13:52,362
你感冒了么 华生?
Have you got a cold Watson?

215
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,585
都是这里污浊的空气闹的
Why it's this poisonous atmosphere.

216
00:13:54,621 --> 00:13:57,283
我想这烟也确实够浓的了
This is a big thick I suppose.

217
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:57,963
浓?
Thick?

218
00:13:58,002 --> 00:13:59,274
简直不能忍受
It's intolerable.

219
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,582
你一整天都待在俱乐部里吧
You've been at your club all day.

220
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:05,199
你怎么知道的?
How'd you know that?

221
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:10,019
你觉得我去了哪儿?
Where do you think I've been?

222
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:11,543
显然就待在这儿啊
Well here clearly.

223
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,074
显然?
Clearly?

224
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,204
我去了德文郡
I've been at Devonshire.

225
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,445
灵魂出窍?
In spirit?

226
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,721
正是
Quite so.

227
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:22,671
我派人从斯塔福德警局取来一份地图
I sent out for a map from Stamford's.

228
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,051
看到了么?
Now see here?

229
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:32,277
巴斯克维尔庄园
Baskerville Hall.

230
00:14:32,926 --> 00:14:35,958
这里是格林盆村 只有几座零星散布的房屋
Grimpen, just a clutter of cottages.

231
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:38,598
这两间房在沼地上
2 moorland houses,

232
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,217
都是农舍
farmhouses,

233
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:42,596
赖福特庄园
Lafter Hall,

234
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,529
梅利琵宅邸 就这些了
Merripit House and that is all.

235
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:48,483
这些代表沼泽地区
Oh this represents marshland

236
00:14:50,297 --> 00:14:52,201
这里就是
and these barrows,

237
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,166
曾经上演悲剧的舞台
some prehistoric settlement

238
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,505
或是埋葬的坟场
or burial ground.

239
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,508
10英里?
10 mile?

240
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:02,682
不用那么远
Disused is it

241
00:15:03,306 --> 00:15:08,555
周围的一切都是多余
and all the rest is waste

242
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,783
我们那高明的罪犯
as far as the great convict,

243
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,114
最远也就只能到普林斯顿监狱了
the prison of Princeton.

244
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:19,983
这地方真是合适 如果魔鬼想要插足于人间之事的话...
It is a worthy setting if the devil did decide

245
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:22,380
这种想法也不是毫无道理
to dabble in the affairs of man.

246
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:24,524
这么说 你自己也倾向于
Then you yourself are inclined

247
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,492
神怪的说法了?
towards a supernatural explanation?

248
00:15:31,827 --> 00:15:34,056
你最好给摩梯末医生捎个话
You'd better send word to Dr. Mortimer,

249
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:36,671
说我们明早和他共进早餐
we'll eat breakfast with him tomorrow.

250
00:15:38,946 --> 00:15:41,396
这是今早寄来的
It arrived by post this morning.

251
00:15:45,652 --> 00:15:48,277
对您来说是小菜一碟吧 福尔摩斯先生?
So you think of little puzzles Mr. Holmes?

252
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:51,828
它已经超过了我思考的能力
This one wants more thinking than I'm able to give it.

253
00:15:52,002 --> 00:15:53,524
昨天寄出的?
Posted yesterday?

254
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:55,066
没错
Yes.

255
00:15:56,318 --> 00:15:57,832
多半是玩笑吧
A joke, as like it's not.

256
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,474
亨利爵士 请告诉我
Tell me Sir Henry

257
00:15:58,513 --> 00:16:00,516
您到了伦敦后 还遇到了什么奇特的事?
has anything interesting happened to you since you've been in London?

258
00:16:00,554 --> 00:16:02,272
不 我想没有
No I don't think so.

259
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,495
有没有被人跟踪?
Ever been followed?

260
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,461
什么?
What?

261
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,433
好像我生活在离奇小说里似的
I seemed to have walked right into a dime novel.

262
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:10,856
为什么有人要跟踪我?
Why should anyone follow me?

263
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,732
这封信是寄到旅店来的
That letter was delivered to the hotel.

264
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:16,796
所以你确实被人跟踪了
You are being followed Sir Henry.

265
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,491
"若你珍视生命或还有理性的话
"If you value your life or your reason

266
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,024
远离沼泽地"
keep away from the moor. "

267
00:16:23,235 --> 00:16:25,197
我在想的是...
The issue I suggest is whether it constitutes

268
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,219
这究竟是个善意的警告还是威胁
a friendly or an unfriendly warning.

269
00:16:28,256 --> 00:16:31,024
显然不能确定啊
That is surely impossible to determine.

270
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:33,031
还是有一些线索的
However has features that may help,

271
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:35,593
比如说信封
the envelope for example.

272
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:38,376
如果说它有点被揉过还能见人的话
If somewhat trampled is presentable.

273
00:16:39,701 --> 00:16:43,346
里面的东西就不是了
It's contents mostly are not.

274
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:45,959
这封信是被人
The letter has been torn

275
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:48,164
很仔细地从一份
neatly enough along a fold

276
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:50,610
泰晤士报的社论上剪下来的
and the leader article in the Times

277
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,295
绝对错不了
the Leaded Bourgeois printers,

278
00:16:52,333 --> 00:16:56,007
肯定是从社论上剪下的字拼出的信息
unmistakable has been chosen from which to cut the message

279
00:16:56,044 --> 00:16:58,074
但都是在匆忙之中剪下的
but the message is all quickly cut

280
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,508
用的是一把短刃的剪刀
with an appropriate short bladed scissors

281
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:02,336
而且在把这些铅字粘到纸上时
and the gluing of the print of the paper

282
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,360
弄出了不少污迹 也没有高低对齐
is smudged and misaligned.

283
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:07,150
给我看一下好吗?
May I see it?

284
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:17,504
这只是半张空白信纸
Only half a sheet of paper

285
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:19,024
水印依然清晰
and yet the watermark is clear.

286
00:17:19,061 --> 00:17:21,461
哈德鲸鱼
Hudson whale.

287
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:22,804
这种纸在中等规格的旅店里
You will find that paper

288
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:25,490
都能找得到
in a hundred middle grade hotels

289
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,500
但这里不会有
but not from here.

290
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:33,243
上等旅舍提供的纸张会重一些
A first class hotel would have a paper of a greater weight.

291
00:17:34,123 --> 00:17:37,589
这种墨水很常用
The ink is institutional.

292
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:42,472
也令我想到了是一家旅店
I would also suggest a hotel.

293
00:17:42,509 --> 00:17:46,354
从中我们又能知道什么呢?
Yet what can we determine from this?

294
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,930
口袋里的棉絮
Pocket fluff.

295
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,402
我推断写下这封信的人
I infer that the person who wrote this message

296
00:17:55,438 --> 00:17:57,335
就住在附近的某间旅店里
is staying at a nearby hotel.

297
00:17:58,356 --> 00:17:59,971
他做事细致
He's neat of habit.

298
00:18:00,932 --> 00:18:03,462
在这件事上也费了一番苦心
And studied the task methodically.

299
00:18:04,301 --> 00:18:06,335
但他之后开始怕被人发现
But then he began to fear discovery.

300
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:08,387
在慌张中完成
He rushed it through

301
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:12,894
然后把信塞在口袋里
and put the result in his pocket

302
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,959
直到找到机会把它寄出去
until such time as he posted it.

303
00:18:15,752 --> 00:18:20,539
诚然 有个可怕的人在威胁着你
It is true that fearful people threaten

304
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,311
但我的解释是
but my interpretation is

305
00:18:22,348 --> 00:18:24,554
这是一封善意的警告
that this is a friendly warning.

306
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,560
因为似乎泄露出这个消息
Because it seems a risk was incurred

307
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:29,201
他也是在冒险
in its execution.

308
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,703
真是太棒了 福尔摩斯先生
Bravo Mr. Holmes

309
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,961
您果然是名不虚传
you fulfill your reputation sir no mistake,

310
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,665
但是 按您的说法 送这封信的人害怕的
but if you're right and this fellow's afraid

311
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:42,448
不只是他自己的问题
then he's afraid not only for his own skin

312
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,899
还在为我担心
but what might happen to me.

313
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,970
没错
Quite so.

314
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,935
摩梯末医生 我想现在应该您来解释了
Dr. Mortimer I think it is time that you explain.

315
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,703
现在您了解情况了 亨利爵士
Well now you know the facts Sir Henry.

316
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:12,866
问题就是
The question is whether or not

317
00:19:12,904 --> 00:19:15,607
您究竟该不该到达特姆尔去
you should go to Dartmoor.

318
00:19:15,644 --> 00:19:17,694
没有任何地狱里的魔鬼
There's no devil in hell

319
00:19:17,732 --> 00:19:19,067
或是世人
nor no man on this earth

320
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:21,772
能阻止我回到我的家乡
that's going to prevent me from going to the home of my own people.

321
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:27,969
这样的话 我们就看看... 怎样把危险减到最低吧
Then we'll see how we can mitigate the danger.

322
00:19:29,645 --> 00:19:31,760
您当真相信会有危险?
You really believe there is danger?

323
00:19:32,358 --> 00:19:35,467
我想如果真有危险 就一定会出大事
I think that if it is, that it is considerable.

324
00:19:36,363 --> 00:19:38,285
您一定不能单独行动
You certainly cannot go alone.

325
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,735
摩梯末医生和我一同回去
Dr. Mortimer returns with me.

326
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:44,642
他的诊所和家离你那儿还有几英里远
He has his practice and he lives some miles distant.

327
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:45,527
您能亲自去么?
You'll come yourself?

328
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:48,913
我得待在伦敦 有一桩勒索的案子
I have to stay in London, blackmail case.

329
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,906
我委托我的朋友华生前去
I recommend my friend Watson.

330
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:59,021
您真是太好了 医生
That's very kind of you Doctor.

331
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:04,731
我会的
I will.

332
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,287
-摩梯末医生... -谢谢你
Dr. Mortimer...Thank you.

333
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,680
华生!
Watson?

334
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:34,663
这边
This way.

335
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:14,792
那人是谁?
Who was that man?

336
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,339
我不知道
I have no idea.

337
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:17,501
你怎么知道
Well how did you know

338
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,227
有人在跟踪巴斯克维尔先生?
someone's been following Baskerville?

339
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,731
如果不是跟踪
How else did they know so immediately

340
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,269
他们怎么能立刻知道他住在哪?
where he was staying?

341
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,201
起码现在他们不会再跟踪他了
At least they'll not continue to follow him now.

342
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,137
华生 当危险到来的时候
When the crisis comes Watson,

343
00:21:33,498 --> 00:21:35,080
肯定会到来的
and it will,

344
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:37,256
要向我报告
report to me.

345
00:21:43,244 --> 00:21:45,751
华生 你知道查尔斯・巴斯克维尔爵士
Watson do you know what the residue

346
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:47,725
留下来的遗产有多少么?
of Sir Charles Baskerville's estate was?

347
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,336
我不知道
No I don't.

348
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:51,321
差不多一百万
Close to a million.

349
00:21:51,856 --> 00:21:54,656
就是这人演这出危险大戏的赌注
A stake on which a man might play a dangerous game.

350
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,544
这可是很大一笔财富
Such a sum has a definite materiality.

351
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:09,304
不过现在 一切还都天差地远呢
And yet of all things in heaven and earth.

352
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:12,394
我们都是讲科学的人 福尔摩斯
We are men of science Holmes.

353
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,615
没错
Yet.

354
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,801
这可是桩邪恶又危险的案子 华生
It's an ugly, dangerous business Watson.

355
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,583
相信我 如果你能平安回到贝克街
Believe me I should be very glad

356
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:32,605
我会很高兴的
to have you back safe and sound in Baker Street Watson.

357
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:36,460
谢谢你 福尔摩斯
Thank you Holmes.

358
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:24,845
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

359
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:38,135
我亲爱的华生 我不会说任何建议和怀疑
My dear Watson I will not bias your mind

360
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,743
来干扰你的思维
by suggesting theories or suspicions.

361
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:43,497
只要讲事实报告给我
Simply report facts to me

362
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:45,917
尽可能写得详细
in the fullest possible manner.

363
00:23:46,244 --> 00:23:49,493
随后的日子里你得集中注意力
Concentrate your attention upon the following.

364
00:23:59,634 --> 00:24:03,488
总之 一如古老的羊皮纸上写的那样
Above all, avoid the moor,

365
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,061
别在黑夜降临 罪恶势力嚣张之时
when as the old parchment frankly put it,

366
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:09,758
走过沼泽地
the paths of evil are exalted.

367
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:14,204
怎么回事 伯金斯?
What is this Perkins?

368
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,742
有个罪犯从普林斯顿监狱越狱了 先生
Convict, escaped from Princetown sir.

369
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:20,289
有三天了
Its 3 days now.

370
00:26:20,327 --> 00:26:22,607
到处都在搜
They've been watching all over,

371
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,831
还没发现他的任何踪迹
they ain't seen no sign of him.

372
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,894
农户们都有些不安
Farmers don't like it.

373
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:29,596
逃出来的是谁?
Who is he?

374
00:26:29,634 --> 00:26:32,410
塞尔丹 在诺丁山杀人的凶手
Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.

375
00:26:32,643 --> 00:26:36,399
家家都门窗紧锁呢
Folk are locking their doors I can tell you.

376
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:40,008
这人干了什么?
What'd the man do?

377
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:42,300
他杀了一家人
He murdered a whole family

378
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:46,301
手段极其残忍
with such savagery they deemed him insane.

379
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:01,698
欢迎您 亨利爵士
Welcome Sir Henry.

380
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:03,253

这边请 亨利爵士

正如我想象中的
Just as I imagined it.

393
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:19,270
完全就和我想的一模一样
To much as I imagined it.

394
00:29:19,684 --> 00:29:21,097
这地方需要放上些
This place needs the products

395
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,167
斯旺或是爱迪生的东西 (指两者发明的电灯)
of Mr's Swann and Edison

396
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:26,903
但我想我会适应的

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,214

白瑞摩
Barrymore,

我妻子和我都很乐意留在您身边

00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,972
做出你自己的安排
and made your arrangements.

410
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,448
但是你的家族世代与我们在一起
But your family's been with us for generations.

411
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:11,123
如果我在这里开始的新生活
I'm sorry to start my life here

412
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,950
要打破这段悠久的往来 我会很遗憾的

Thank you sir.

我妻子和我都很敬爱查尔斯爵士

00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:31,291
我们觉得没有什么...
We feel that nothing can be...

417
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,103
我们觉得...
we feel...

418
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:40,726
继续留在这里 会使我们很不好受 先生
we feel we shall never be easy here at the hall sir.

419
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,936
的确
Right.

420
00:32:46,974 --> 00:32:49,189
你们有何打算?
Well what do you mean to do?

421
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:51,034
由于查尔斯爵士的慷慨

423
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,013
做些小本买卖 先生

谢谢你告诉我这些
Well thank you for telling me.

425
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,628
我可以期待一下 某天在你家
Might I look forward to you pulling me a pint

426
00:33:02,668 --> 00:33:04,708
得到你一杯美酒的招待吗?

就这么约定了?
Mind you call it Baskerville arms?

430
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,677
好的 先生
Yes sir.

431
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,714
谢谢您 先生
Thank you sir.

432
00:33:29,956 --> 00:33:31,852
这个男人害怕了
That man is frightened.

433
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:57,965
是的
Yes.

434
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,948
晚上不好捱啊
Turning into a rough night.

435
00:33:55,271 --> 00:33:57,038
早上我要步行
I shall walk over to the post office

436
00:33:57,075 --> 00:33:58,778
去格林盆的邮局
at Grimpen in the morning.

437
00:34:02,034 --> 00:34:04,117
很抱歉 可是福尔摩斯嘱咐过我
I'm sorry but Holmes asked me

438
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:05,830
不能让您单独离开房子...
not to let you leave the house without...

439
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,254
医生 这玩意儿可以对付任何一条狗
Doctor, this shall take care of any dog

440
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:10,796
就算没有你的相陪
that I may meet in your absence.

441
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:12,849
就算你有武器
Even armed.

442
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:17,338
好吧
All right.

443
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:20,699
明天早上我会留在家里
Tomorrow morning shall find me at home.

444
00:34:20,736 --> 00:34:22,534
在家总安全了吧?
I'm safe at home am I?

445
00:34:22,571 --> 00:34:25,363
福尔摩斯是这么相信的
Well that's what Holmes believes.

446
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:57,915
这可是桩邪恶又危险的案子 华生
It's an ugly and dangerous business Watson.

447
00:34:57,953 --> 00:35:01,212
相信我 如果你能平安回到贝克街
I shall be glad to have you back safe and sound

448
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:04,283
我会很高兴的
in Baker Street once more.

449
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:19,870
有的问题就连最精明老练的侦探也束手无策
There's a realm in which the most accomplished detective is helpless.

450
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,298
有些事物
There are certain things here,

451
00:35:23,335 --> 00:35:24,947
虽然全然不符合自然规律
which are impossible to reconcile

452
00:35:24,985 --> 00:35:27,946
可依旧存在着
to the settled order of nature.

453
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:42,845
总之 一如古老的羊皮纸上写的那样
Above all avoid the moor

454
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:46,199
别在黑夜降临 罪恶势力嚣张之时
whereas the old parchment quaintly puts it,

455
00:35:46,237 --> 00:35:49,803
走进沼泽地
the powers of evil are exalted.

456
00:36:10,186 --> 00:36:13,502
你知道查尔斯・巴斯克维尔爵士 留下来的遗产有多少么?
Do you know what the residue of Sir Charles Baskerville's estate was?

457
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,367
差不多一百万
Close to a million.

458
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:20,975
就是这人演这出危险大戏的赌注
Such a sum has such a distinctive materiality about it.

459
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:47,938
早上好
Good morning.

460
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,723
今天您好吗?
How are you today?

461
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:51,912
很好 谢谢
Oh very well thank you.

462
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,144
给你
There we are.

463
00:36:53,181 --> 00:36:54,824
-谢谢 先生 -谢谢
-Thank you sir. -Thank you.

464
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:00,620
再见
Goodbye.

465
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:02,698
再见 先生
Goodbye sir.

466
00:37:14,586 --> 00:37:16,139
华生医生?
Dr. Watson?

467
00:37:17,556 --> 00:37:18,989
请饶恕我的冒昧推测
Excuse my presumption.

468
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:22,147
摩梯末医生在您经过他诊所窗前的时候
Dr. Mortimer pointed you out to me

469
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:24,165
把您指给了我看
from the window of his surgery as you passed.

470
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,716
或许他已经告诉你的名字
Possibly he's told you my name,

471
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,505
梅利琵宅邸的斯泰普顿
Stapleton of Merripit House.

472
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,662
是的 当然 您好
Yes indeed, how do you do?

473
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:31,635
我们都很担心
We were concerned,

474
00:37:31,671 --> 00:37:33,858
弗兰克兰  摩梯末 和我
Frankland, Mortimer and I.

475
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:35,380
担心?
Concerned?

476
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:37,345
不太希望亨利爵士回来
Less Sir Henry should not have come.

477
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:41,048
你知道那个恶犬的传说
You know the legend of the fiend hound.

478
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,435
我们本以为这会让他噩梦缠身
We thought it might seize his imagination

479
00:37:43,472 --> 00:37:46,900
就像可怜的查尔斯伯爵受到的影响一样
just as it seized poor Sir Charles's.

480
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:50,343
夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生还好吗?
How is Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

481
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,961
华生医生 您既然因此而来到此地
Dr. Watson you are here of it.

482
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:56,174
那么这一定引起了福尔摩斯先生的兴趣
It follows then that Mr. Holmes is interested.

483
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,550
我恐怕无法回答你的问题
I'm afraid I cannot answer your question.

484
00:38:00,225 --> 00:38:04,351
请容我一问 我们有这个荣幸见到他吗?
Well may I ask if he is going to honor us with a visit himself?

485
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:05,441
他离不开城里
He cannot leave town.

486
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,758
有别的案子要忙
Other cases engage his attention.

487
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:08,612
你可以相信
I assure you

488
00:38:08,651 --> 00:38:10,991
我来这只是单纯拜访我的朋友 亨利爵士
I'm simply here to visit my friend, Sir Henry.

489
00:38:11,028 --> 00:38:12,534
我不需要帮助
I do not need help.

490
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:15,258
我为我的打扰道歉
I apologize for the intrusion.

491
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:20,573
沿着这条小径慢慢走
A moderate walk along this path

492
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:21,901
可以把我们带到梅利琵
brings us to Merripit House

493
00:38:21,939 --> 00:38:27,295
或许您愿意抽出一个小时 华生医生
I wonder or perhaps you would spare me an hour Dr. Watson

494
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:30,009
让我有这个荣幸 把您介绍给我的妹妹认识
that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.

495
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,825
巴斯克维尔庄园的人还在等我回去
I'm expected back at Baskerville hall.

496
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:34,995
但是我想一个小时不会有大碍
I'm sure an hour will not hurt.

497
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,206
谢谢 斯泰普顿先生
Thank you Mr. Stapleton.

498
00:38:41,709 --> 00:38:43,028
是因为对昆虫学的研究
It was entomology was it

499
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:44,741
让你走进这片沼泽吗?
that brought you to the moor?

500
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:48,411
的确 但是它本身也吸引了我
Indeed although I delight in it for it's own sake.

501
00:38:48,447 --> 00:38:51,395
这里如此广阔
It is so vast,

502
00:38:52,318 --> 00:38:53,484
如此荒凉
so barren,

503
00:38:53,522 --> 00:38:55,402
如此神秘
so mysterious.

504
00:38:56,069 --> 00:38:58,053
比如看那儿
Well there for instance

505
00:38:58,089 --> 00:38:59,491
你有何感受?
what do you make of that?

506
00:38:59,528 --> 00:39:02,050
是块少有的能纵马奔驰的地方
Well it would be a rare place for a gallop.

507
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,614
那就是伟大的格林盆泥沼
That is the great Grimpen Mire.

508
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:11,720
无论人畜 在那儿走错一步 就意味着死亡
False step down means death to man or beast.

509
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:15,985
昨天我还看到一匹小马驹闯进那里
Well only yesterday I saw one of the moor ponies wonder into it.

510
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,124
再也没有出来
Never came out.

511
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:20,461
过了很长时间我还看到它的脑袋
I could see his head for quite some time

512
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,427
从泥坑里探出来
straining out of the bog hole,

513
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,110
但最终还是被吞噬了
but it sucked him down at last.

514
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:28,206
就算是在旱季里 要穿越它也是很危险的
Even the dry season it is a danger to cross it,

515
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,223
而最近连续下了几场雨
but after these recent rains

516
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,328
它就成了一块不幸之地
it is an awful place.

517
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,336
然而
And yet

518
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:38,577
我可以找到一条直达它腹地的路
I can find my way to the very heart of it

519
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,277
再活着回来
and return alive.

520
00:39:41,314 --> 00:39:45,879
但是你为什么想要去那么恐怖的地方呢?
But why should you wish to visit such a horrible place?

521
00:39:45,915 --> 00:39:50,455
你看到那里低矮的小山了吗?
You see the low hills there beyond it?

522
00:39:50,493 --> 00:39:52,546
它们是真正的岛屿
They're really islands.

523
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,970
那里的植物群与世隔绝
Flora there is undisturbed,

524
00:39:55,006 --> 00:39:55,718
这就意味着
which mean of course,

525
00:39:55,757 --> 00:39:57,705
会有稀有的物种生长在那里
that rare species can breed there

526
00:39:57,744 --> 00:39:59,707
其中有一种兰凯尼迪的亚种
and one of them a subspecies Lycanidi

527
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:02,235
是这里特有的
is unique to the place.

528
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:07,346
事实上是我发现的它
In fact I'm credited with its discovery.

529
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:08,823
真的?
Really?

530
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:19,260
沼泽里到处是声响
The moor is full of noises.

531
00:40:19,914 --> 00:40:21,676
但这是什么?
But what was it?

532
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:24,724
农夫说它是巴斯克维尔的猎犬
The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles

533
00:40:24,763 --> 00:40:26,504
正在捕食
calling for its prey.

534
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:29,160
你不会相信这种无稽之谈吧?
You don't believe such nonsense surely?

535
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:32,354
你有听过鸬鹚叫吗?
Did you ever hear the boom of a bittern?

536
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:33,817
没有
No.

537
00:40:33,857 --> 00:40:36,476
据说这种鸟眼下只有在
The bird is said, now, to be confined to

538
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:40,430
诺福克的沼泽里出没 但为什么这里就不能有呢?
certain Norfolk fens but why not here?

539
00:40:40,468 --> 00:40:41,663
我听说它的叫声
I've heard its cry described

540
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,304
被描绘成介于
as being something between

541
00:40:43,341 --> 00:40:46,434
尖锐的雾角和 灵魂的惨叫声之间
a foghorn and a soul in torment.

542
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:48,068
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

543
00:40:49,352 --> 00:40:51,107
啊...
Ah,

544
00:40:52,218 --> 00:40:53,913
凯罗派德飞蛾
Cyclopides.

545
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:23,906
回去!
Go back!

546
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:26,806
马上就回伦敦!
Go straight to London instantly!

547
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:29,367
看在上帝的份上 照我说的做!
For God's sake do as I ask.

548
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,983
回去吧 再也不要踏入这里半步
Go back and never set foot on the moor again.

549
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,154
嘘 我哥哥回来了
Sh, my brother is coming.

550
00:41:34,193 --> 00:41:35,282
斯泰普顿小姐
Miss Stapleton.

551
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,245
不惜一切代价离开这里
Get away from this place at all costs.

552
00:41:40,198 --> 00:41:41,797
您看见那兰花了吗?
Do you see that orchid?

553
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:45,689
是 我看见了
Yes, yes I do.

554
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:47,234
真可惜您来晚了
It's a pity you came so late.

555
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:50,484
我们最好的兰花都已经凋谢了
Our best orchids are nearly over.

556
00:41:50,522 --> 00:41:52,285
Jack
Jack.

557
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:55,438
我看见你已经自我介绍过了
You have introduced yourselves I see.

558
00:41:55,477 --> 00:41:56,735
是的
Yes.

559
00:41:56,772 --> 00:41:57,975
我正对亨利爵士说
I was telling Sir Henry

560
00:41:58,014 --> 00:42:02,356
他错过了我们沼泽最美的风景
it's a pity he has missed the beauties of the moor.

561
00:42:02,392 --> 00:42:05,255
如果我是亨利爵士 斯泰普顿小姐
Were I Sir Henry Miss Stapleton

562
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:07,439
我一定不会错过您的美丽
I'm sure I would not miss your beauty

563
00:42:07,477 --> 00:42:09,008
可惜我不是
but I'm afraid I'm not,

564
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:10,313
亨利爵士是...
Sir Henry that is,

565
00:42:10,348 --> 00:42:11,528
我算是他的朋友
merely his friend

566
00:42:11,567 --> 00:42:15,286
约翰 华生医生愿意为您效劳
Doctor John Watson at your service.

567
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:17,957
你抓住你的蝴蝶了吗?
Did you catch your butterfly?

568
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:19,175
没有
No.

569
00:42:19,213 --> 00:42:21,972
高山上的飞虫就像是巫女
Highly flies like a witch I'm afraid.

570
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:26,420
啊 在那儿
Ah there.

571
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,608
看这个
Look at this.

572
00:42:29,645 --> 00:42:31,560
请您原谅并忘记
You must forgive and forget

573
00:42:31,597 --> 00:42:33,166
我刚才愚蠢的鲁莽 华生医生
my foolish outburst Doctor Watson.

574
00:42:33,203 --> 00:42:35,191
我忘不了 斯泰普顿小姐
I cannot forget Miss Stapleton.

575
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:36,838
您必须得忘
You must.

576
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:38,190
亨利爵士是我的朋友
Sir Henry is my friend.

577
00:42:38,228 --> 00:42:40,936
我在乎他的安危
His welfare is a very close concern of mine.

578
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:42,400
告诉我你为何如此急于
Tell me why you are so eager

579
00:42:42,438 --> 00:42:44,261
让他回伦敦?
that he should return to London?

580
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:45,765
你知道猎犬的故事吧?
You know the story of the hound?

581
00:42:45,803 --> 00:42:47,893
我不相信这种无稽之谈
I do not believe such nonsense.

582
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,565
但是我信
But I do.

583
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,630
如果亨利爵士肯听您的
If you have any influence with Sir Henry

584
00:42:51,668 --> 00:42:53,265
带他走吧
take him away.

585
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:55,375
恐怕除非你告诉我
I fear that unless you can give me

586
00:42:55,414 --> 00:42:56,840
比这更可靠的理由
more definite information than this

587
00:42:56,878 --> 00:42:58,584
否则是没法让他离开这儿的
it would be impossible to get him to move.

588
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:01,452
我说不出确切的理由
I cannot say anything definite

589
00:43:01,489 --> 00:43:03,493
因为我不知道什么是确切的
for I do not know anything definite.

590
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:05,237
斯泰普顿小姐
Miss Stapleton,

591
00:43:05,276 --> 00:43:07,632
我想再问你一个问题
I would ask you one more question,

592
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,258
如果仅仅如此而已
if you meant no more than this

593
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,209
为何刚才你向我开口的时候
when you first spoke to me,

594
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:12,050
如此焦急 而且不让你的哥哥
why were you so eager that your brother

595
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,634
听到你所说的话?
should not overhear what you said?

596
00:43:13,672 --> 00:43:14,748
并没有什么是他
There is nothing to which he,

597
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:17,140
或是谁会反对的呀
or anybody else, could object.

598
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,968
我哥哥很希望庄园能有人居住
My brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited.

599
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:23,285
他觉得这是件好事
He thinks it's for the good

600
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,155
对住在沼泽上的穷人来说
of the poor folk upon the moor.

601
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:27,662
他一定会生气
He would be very angry

602
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:29,298
如果让他知道我说了这些
if he knew I had said anything,

603
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:32,607
劝亨利爵士离开的话
which might induce Sir Henry to go away.

604
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:40,070
运气好吗?
Any luck?

605
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:41,650
恐怕没有
Afraid not.

606
00:43:42,561 --> 00:43:46,369
飞虫就像是巫女 却如此美丽
Flies like a witch and so beautiful.

607
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:49,041
纹黄蝶
Pale, clouded yellow.

608
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,897
我已经抓住了不少
I have a number of them I've caught.

609
00:43:52,646 --> 00:43:54,552
一定得给你看看我的收藏
I must show you my collection.

610
00:43:59,176 --> 00:44:01,906
英格兰这块土地让我不再从医
The English led the Doctor out of my field.

611
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,541
我对那些昆虫已经做了特别的研究
And I've made a particular study of those insects,

612
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:10,783
它们栖息于石南和湿地的周边
which inhabit the margins of heath and marsh.

613
00:44:15,657 --> 00:44:17,340
真是庞大的收藏
A magnificent collection

614
00:44:17,378 --> 00:44:20,814
很有科学家的风范
and the work of a serious scientist.

615
00:44:20,852 --> 00:44:23,256
甚至是那些奇特品种
Even the exotica,

616
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:27,040
我必须提一下这一神奇的物种 被称为莫普迪斯兰匹达
I must mention a brilliant creature called Morpo peridis lapida

617
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:30,350
被按照日期编制成目录
was dated and cataloged with the carrier replies

618
00:44:30,389 --> 00:44:34,951
归入他个人的发现 英国兰凯尼迪蝶
to his personal field, the British Lycanidi.

619
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:40,896
它们正是这沼泽里独有的
One of which is unique to the moor.

620
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:44,000
我也要向你报告
I must also report

621
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:47,128
那只新的棕色靴子出现了
that the new brown boot has turned up.

622
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:49,466
Barrymore找到了它
Barrymore found it

623
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:52,519
就在他解开亨利先生的行礼时
amongst Sir Henry's luggage when he unpacked.

624
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:56,894
斯泰普顿小姐落落大方
Miss Stapleton is very handsome

625
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,182
星期二我们会在这里吃晚饭
and on Tuesday we are to dine here

626
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:01,999
同时邀请巴斯克维尔庄园的左邻右舍
at Baskerville Hall with all our neighbors.

627
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:03,497
于是 亨利爵士
So Sir Henry,

628
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,985
在受到你禁足令后终于喜上眉梢
who chaffs a little at the restrictions you have imposed upon him,

629
00:45:07,023 --> 00:45:11,160
会有机会自己来评价对方美丽与否了
will have a chance to judge her beauty for himself.

630
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:25,549
我们也会和摩梯末医生的太太见面
We're also to meet Dr. Mortimer's wife

631
00:45:25,587 --> 00:45:28,735
以及格林盆年长的牧师 他们说为人极其害羞
and the old vicar of Grimpen who is very shy they say

632
00:45:29,473 --> 00:45:31,116
还有弗兰克兰
and Mr. Frankland,

633
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:32,937
算得上一名业余的天文学家
an amateur astronomer of some note

634
00:45:32,975 --> 00:45:36,091
在人心目中是个得理不饶人的人
who has a reputation of being litigious to a fault.

635
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,690
这是个大喜的日子
A red-letter day.

636
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:40,330
法律就是法律 我得好好教教他们
The law is law and I need to teach them.

637
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,566
我被大家高高抬起
I have established a right-of-way

638
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:45,780
从老米德尔顿公园中央游行而过
slapped through the middle of old Middleton's Park.

639
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:48,689
今天宣判的结果
Case decided today.

640
00:45:48,727 --> 00:45:50,592
我们必须教训教训那些混蛋
We must teach these magnets

641
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,193
他们不能冷酷无情地肆意践踏百姓的权利
they cannot ride roughshod over the rights of commoners.

642
00:45:53,231 --> 00:45:54,615
今天宣判的结果
Case decided today.

643
00:45:54,654 --> 00:45:56,208
今天 弗兰克兰先生?
Today Mr. Franklin?

644
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:57,897
今天 先生
Today sir.

645
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:59,453
你为什么问?
Why do you ask?

646
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,904
听说你在芬尼沃斯的森林
Seeing you in Fernworthy that you had the

647
00:46:01,943 --> 00:46:04,644
要对村名关闭也是在今天
wood bear closed to the villagers also today.

648
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:06,758
所以我说了是个大喜的日子
Red-letter day as I said.

649
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:08,537
没错 先生
True sir.

650
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:11,757
今晚我的肖像又要被人在芬尼沃斯焚烧了
I shall be burnt in effigy tonight in Fernworthy

651
00:46:11,796 --> 00:46:14,383
但是我有案子能告他们
but I have the case against them.

652
00:46:14,681 --> 00:46:17,612
坏人被认为没有财产权
Infernal people seem to think there are no rights of property.

653
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,794
他们随意而居
They can swarm where they like

654
00:46:18,833 --> 00:46:20,672
带着他们野餐的报纸和瓶子
with their picnic papers and bottles

655
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,085
他们还有什么好抱怨的?
but why should they complain?

656
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,797
现在没人去森林了
No one goes to the wood now.

657
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:25,478
他们必须穿过沼泽才能到那儿
They have to cross the moor to get to it;

658
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,397
没人会去穿越沼泽的
no one will cross the moor.

659
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:28,973
为什么呢 先生?
And why is that sir?

660
00:46:29,013 --> 00:46:31,209
你肯定听说过了吧
You've surely heard?

661
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:33,689
猎犬在沼泽里出没
The hound walks abroad upon the moor.

662
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,803
巴斯克维尔的猎犬 亨利爵士
The hound of the Baskervilles Sir Henry.

663
00:46:36,844 --> 00:46:37,766
我听说了
I've heard.

664
00:46:37,802 --> 00:46:41,216
只有你一个人这么想吗 弗兰克兰先生?
Is it a phenomenon you believe in yourself Mr. Frankland.

665
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:43,487
问问牧师吧
Ask the vicar.

666
00:46:43,525 --> 00:46:46,229
天文和法庭辩论是我的强项
Astronomic and forensic matters are my domain,

667
00:46:46,267 --> 00:46:48,906
当地的事务是他的强项
demonic matters are his.

668
00:46:50,899 --> 00:46:54,825
真有猎犬吗 牧师 还是别的什么?
Is it a hound of hell vicar or what?

669
00:46:56,016 --> 00:46:57,797
是
Yes.

670
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:00,989
一个有趣的问题
An interesting question.

671
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:03,866
不管被看见的究竟是什么
Whatever it is that is being seen

672
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,450
它的确存在着
it is undoubtedly something.

673
00:47:07,921 --> 00:47:10,008
我们的蹄铁匠 托马斯 查博
Our farrier, Thomas Chub,

674
00:47:10,046 --> 00:47:13,176
并不是一个无中生有的人
is not a man given to visions

675
00:47:13,214 --> 00:47:15,927
而他在那里看到了某种东西
and he saw something out there.

676
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,043
他说是一条狗
A dog he said,

677
00:47:18,082 --> 00:47:20,254
个头有小牛那么大
about the size of a calf.

678
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:25,423
说当地人有些歇斯底里
And I do not think local hysteria

679
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:30,396
在我看来理由并不充分
is an adequate explanation myself.

680
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:34,261
不管它到底是什么
I pray nightly

681
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,002
我每天晚上都祈祷
that it remove itself

682
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:38,871
它能离开我们这个地方
from us whatever it is

683
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,797
让我们有更安稳的觉睡
and that we all may sleep the more soundly.

684
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,529
没错
Yes.

685
00:47:47,644 --> 00:47:49,040
我觉得让大伙儿坐卧不安的
I believe it is Selden

686
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:51,518
应该是那个杀人犯塞尔丹
the murderer who frightens the folk.

687
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:55,888
格林盆一带的人都相信他仍在沼地里
In Grimpen they believe he is still upon the moor.

688
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:59,294
我们总是太富于优越感了
We are too ready to condescend and attribute

689
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:02,067
还总说这些可怜的人很迷信
superstition to these poor people

690
00:48:02,104 --> 00:48:03,167
而事实上
when they are, in fact,

691
00:48:03,207 --> 00:48:07,926
他们只是出于自然的本能的恐惧罢了
subject to a natural and sensible fear.

692
00:48:07,964 --> 00:48:10,649
妙极了 斯泰普顿小姐
Bravo Miss Stapleton,

693
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:11,477
妙极了
Bravo.

694
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:13,010
这条恶犬是无法逃脱法律的惩罚的
This hellhound's existence

695
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:16,190
纯粹是乡间传闻
would not survive a court of law, mere hearsay.

696
00:48:16,228 --> 00:48:17,840
把它带到法庭上
Bring the thing before the bench

697
00:48:17,879 --> 00:48:22,371
经受法律的考验 我才会相信它真的存在
in the full blaze of jurisprudence say I then I will believe in it.

698
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:37,368
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

699
00:48:38,337 --> 00:48:40,139
谢谢你今晚的盛情款待
Thank you for a nice evening.

700
00:48:40,229 --> 00:48:42,273
-晚安 医生 -很高兴见到你
-Goodnight Doctor. -Very nice to see you.

701
00:49:02,191 --> 00:49:03,093
亨利爵士?
Sir Henry?

702
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,157
哎
Yes.

703
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,620
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

704
00:49:07,393 --> 00:49:09,024
亨利爵士
Sir Henry.

705
00:49:09,064 --> 00:49:11,163
亲爱的朋友 今晚真是太好了
My dear fellow it's wonderful.

706
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:14,203
你的红葡萄酒真是不错
I must compliment you on that claret.

707
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:14,945
味道好极了
Delicious

708
00:49:14,984 --> 00:49:16,778
真是太令人愉快了
Absolutely delightful.

709
00:49:16,815 --> 00:49:17,784
谢谢
Thank you.

710
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:18,970
晚安
Goodnight.

711
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,350
是白瑞摩吗?
Barrymore?

712
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:12,295
是的
Yes.

713
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:15,352
他在那儿呆了半个小时了
He's been there a half an hour.

714
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:23,436
他在干嘛?
What's he doing?

715
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:25,469
不知道
I don't know.

716
00:51:27,946 --> 00:51:29,280
瞧!
Look!

717
00:51:30,507 --> 00:51:32,647
在沼地上
Out on the moor.

718
00:51:58,175 --> 00:51:59,711
事发偶然  亨利爵士
It just happened Sir Henry.

719
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:02,393
我们肯定不能再到沼地里去了
We must not go on to the moor undoubtless.

720
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,409
他们是不是有些夸大其词了 医生?
And then the powers are exalted Doctor?

721
00:52:04,448 --> 00:52:06,802
妖怪是用来吓唬小孩的 老兄
Bogie's to frighten children man.

722
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,343
去吧 我们今晚有机会把事情查个水落石出
Come on, we have a chance of getting to the bottom of this business tonight.

723
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:44,306
在那儿
There.

724
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:53,827
华生
Watson.

725
00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:16,029
怎么了 你还好吧?
what You all right?

726
00:53:17,788 --> 00:53:20,199
我想开枪 可是开不了
I felt to shoot but I couldn't.

727
00:53:20,977 --> 00:53:22,140
来吧
Come on.

728
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,201
天呐
My God.

729
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,580
你觉得这些传言可信吗?
You believe there's any truth in these rumors?

730
00:53:40,546 --> 00:53:41,966
看呐!
Look!

731
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:45,463
那是什么?
What is it?

732
00:53:45,707 --> 00:53:47,191
白瑞摩?
Barrymore?

733
00:53:48,163 --> 00:53:51,578
无论如何不是塞尔丹
It's not Selden at any rate.

734
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:53,431
在伦敦我们就被跟踪了
We were followed in London

735
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:55,828
现在仍然受到跟踪
and we're followed still.

736
00:53:56,359 --> 00:54:00,079
走吧 回屋子里去
Come on let's get back to the house.

737
00:54:20,587 --> 00:54:22,668
到底怎么回事 白瑞摩?
What's this all about Barrymore?

738
00:54:22,706 --> 00:54:24,278
先生 也许...
Sir it may...

739
00:54:24,317 --> 00:54:26,486
也许看上去我们辜负了您的信任
it may seem that we have betrayed your trust.

740
00:54:26,523 --> 00:54:27,529
看上去?
Seem?

741
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,109
见鬼 白瑞摩 根本就是!
Damn it Barrymore you have!

742
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:30,985
先生...先生 这不是他的错 先生
Sir...sir no fault of his sir.

743
00:54:31,463 --> 00:54:33,211
他不想那样干的 都是我
He didn't want it it's me.

744
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:35,641
是我 是我的错
It's me and mine.

745
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,892
那个可怜人来向我求助 先生
The poor creature came to me for help sir.

746
00:54:38,932 --> 00:54:40,561
我怎么忍心拒绝呢?
How could I refuse

747
00:54:40,599 --> 00:54:42,870
看到他受了他们那么多罪
after what they have done to him?

748
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:45,852
白瑞摩太太 我不明白
So then Mrs. Barrymore I don't understand

749
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:48,893
他干嘛要来找你这样可敬的女士呢?
why should he come to respectable woman?

750
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,569
他是她的弟弟 先生
He's her brother sir.

751
00:54:53,609 --> 00:54:55,048
什么?
What?

752
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,493
是真的 先生
It's true sir.

753
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:01,687
他到这儿来的时候饿得半死
He dragged himself here half starved.

754
00:55:02,976 --> 00:55:04,630
你觉得我们还能怎么做呢?
And what would you expect?

755
00:55:04,671 --> 00:55:06,397
我们给了他食物
We fed him.

756
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,529
我们把食物带出去给他 先生
We took food out for him sir,

757
00:55:08,566 --> 00:55:11,534
就像您会对待一条狗那样
no more than you would for a dog.

758
00:55:11,573 --> 00:55:13,340
我们希望他走掉
We hoped he'd go

759
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:17,243
但是夜复一夜那灯光都在那里闪烁着
but the light has been there night after night.

760
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:19,011
是真的吗 白瑞摩?
Is this true Barrymore?

761
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:21,127
是的 先生
Yes sir.

762
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,038
你知道那家伙干过什么吗 白瑞摩?
Have you any conception what this man did Barrymore?

763
00:55:25,074 --> 00:55:26,214
是的 先生
Yes sir.

764
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:29,817
但他已经是一个没有伤害力的人了
But he's a broken man.

765
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:34,473
他们对他做了手术 驯服了他 先生
They done surgery sir to tame him.

766
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,603
他就像是个孩子 先生
He's like a child sir.

767
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,463
求您了 先生
Please sir.

768
00:55:42,786 --> 00:55:44,231
白瑞摩太太 请你...
Mrs. Barrymore please.

769
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:45,528
请你起来
Please get up.

770
00:55:45,564 --> 00:55:47,061
这样做有失尊严
This is not dignified please.

771
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,232
亲爱的
My dear.

772
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:54,466
先生 他已经被安排好离开这里
By a leave sir arrangements have been made.

773
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:57,158
几天后他就会离开这个国家
He'll be out of the country in a few days.

774
00:55:57,198 --> 00:56:01,098
我恳求您 先生 别向警方举报他
I beg you sir say nothing to the police.

775
00:56:05,046 --> 00:56:07,409
你觉得呢 医生?
What do you think Doctor?

776
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:10,211
你说他现在不会再害人了 白瑞摩
You say he's harmless now Barrymore

777
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,774
可是他还拿大石头砸我们
yet he threw a rock at us.

778
00:56:11,813 --> 00:56:14,659
就像小孩子扔石头那样啊 先生
As a child might throw stones sir.

779
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:18,415
那些谋杀常常萦绕在他心里
The murders are going to haunt him.

780
00:56:18,453 --> 00:56:22,227
他现在就像是个受了惊的孩子 先生
He's a frightening baby now sir.

781
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:26,358
这个形容很恰当
This is an apt description.

782
00:56:27,203 --> 00:56:29,430
他不会再害人了
He will be harmless.

783
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:35,351
很好
Very well.

784
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,967
请把你的妻子带回房吧
Please take your wife to your room.

785
00:56:39,006 --> 00:56:42,248
对这件事我们不会提起
We'll say nothing about this matter.

786
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,649
谢谢您 先生
Thank you sir.

787
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:11,706
我还以为我们得到了
I thought we had a chance

788
00:57:11,746 --> 00:57:14,241
一个彻底查清此事的机会
of getting to the bottom of this business.

789
00:57:14,279 --> 00:57:18,001
可是我们所做的 似乎只是犯下了重罪
All we've seemed to of done is compound a felony.

790
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:29,905
不过我还是很高兴
I'm glad though that you

791
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:32,158
你在沼地里听到了那个声音
heard that sound on the moor.

792
00:57:32,646 --> 00:57:35,095
我原来已经开始觉得是我的幻听了
I was beginning to think I'd dreamt it.

793
00:57:36,307 --> 00:57:37,952
我曾经去过保护区
I was in the territories once.

794
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,255
在那儿见到过不少狼
I've heard wolves up there

795
00:57:41,091 --> 00:57:42,535
但是没有什么能像今晚的声音
but nothing to freeze the blood

796
00:57:42,573 --> 00:57:44,797
那样让我毛骨悚然
Iike that sound tonight.

797
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,520
你确信就是那条恶犬吗?
Are you convinced it's the hound?

798
00:57:47,558 --> 00:57:48,937
是的
I am.

799
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:52,186
我真希望福尔摩斯在这里
I wish to God Holmes was here.

800
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:55,350
他怎么还不来?
Why does he not come?

801
00:58:01,818 --> 00:58:03,095
但是 福尔摩斯
And yet Holmes

802
00:58:03,303 --> 00:58:06,162
当天亮了 小鸟又开始歌唱
when daylight and birdsong return

803
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:10,810
夜晚那种阴暗的景象荡然无存
the black imaginings of the night evaporate.

804
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,282
即使是摩梯末医生不断地拜访
Even Dr. Mortimer assiduous visits,

805
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,908
以及期间他不变的
accompanied as they are,

806
00:58:14,945 --> 00:58:18,467
有关骨头和尸体的谈话
by constant talk of bones, or mortal residue,

807
00:58:18,504 --> 00:58:22,842
也无法抹杀沼地秋日的美景
fail to sour the beauties of the moor in autumn.

808
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,515
可是 我们...
We are, however,

809
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,271
对于这个谜团依然毫无头绪
still far from the heart of the mystery.

810
00:58:33,308 --> 00:58:37,483
而最让我烦恼的问题就是
The question, which most persistently nags me,

811
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,251
石山上的那个人究竟是谁?
is who's the man on the tor?

812
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,854
我觉得要是我们知道了他的身份
With his identity known

813
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,067
我们就能找到
I feel we should have the key

814
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,266
解开这个谜团的钥匙
to this fatal riddle within our grasp.

815
00:58:49,595 --> 00:58:51,763
这块布料很好的
This is rather a nice piece of cloth.

816
00:58:51,801 --> 00:58:52,924
我觉得...
I think they...

817
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:55,404
与此同时 我还发现了
Meanwhile, I have discovered a

818
00:58:55,441 --> 00:58:59,017
我们的男主人心地非常善良
streak amiable tender heartedness in my host.

819
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:02,489
他对差点射杀男仆的那个杀人犯小舅子
So guilty did he feel of nearly shooting

820
00:59:02,528 --> 00:59:04,471
深感内疚
his servant's murderous brother-in-law

821
00:59:04,509 --> 00:59:06,226
于是他就给了白瑞摩
that he's given Barrymore

822
00:59:06,266 --> 00:59:09,478
不少他从美国带来的做工一流的衣服
many of his excellent American clothes.

823
00:59:09,516 --> 00:59:11,099
他决心当好
Determined, as he now is,

824
00:59:11,137 --> 00:59:13,106
一个英国乡绅的角色
to play the role of English squire

825
00:59:13,145 --> 00:59:16,730
不管是从服装还是从其他方面
in dress as in anything else.

826
00:59:16,769 --> 00:59:18,787
太美国化了 而我正打算翻开生活崭新的一页
Much too American and I'm turning over a new leaf.

827
00:59:18,825 --> 00:59:19,519
你拿去吧
You take it.

828
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,888
谢谢您的好意 爵士
Thank you kindly sir.

829
00:59:38,773 --> 00:59:40,639
这衣服真不错啊  亨利爵士
Very smart Sir Henry.

830
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:42,180
是的
Yeah.

831
00:59:42,217 --> 00:59:45,047
我打算散步去梅利琵庄园
Well I'm going to stroll up to Merripit House

832
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:48,014
我觉得我该邀请斯泰普顿和他妹妹
I thought I'd invite Stapleton and his sister

833
00:59:48,053 --> 00:59:52,176
我更愿意说是斯泰普顿小姐和她哥哥
rather I should say, Miss Stapleton and her brother

834
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,565
星期一到我们这来用午餐
to luncheon on Monday.

835
00:59:54,603 --> 00:59:59,133
好吧 我知道你不想要我跟你一起去
Well I know you won't want me to come with you there

836
00:59:59,171 --> 01:00:00,910
可福尔摩斯坚持要我...
but Holmes insisted that I...

837
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:02,148
可是 我的朋友
Now look here my friend,

838
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:06,194
福尔摩斯不可能预见到某些事的发展
Holmes could not have foreseen certain developments.

839
01:00:06,233 --> 01:00:08,282
你会成为一个很文明的电灯泡
You'd make a very civil gooseberry

840
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:12,610
我想我还是自己去就好了
but no I'm afraid I have to go alone.

841
01:00:32,163 --> 01:00:34,123
下一站 伦敦
London next stop.

842
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:37,173
下一站 伦敦
London next stop.

843
01:02:08,268 --> 01:02:09,981
巴斯克维尔!
Baskerville!

844
01:02:10,019 --> 01:02:12,811
巴斯克维尔 你怎么敢这样 先生
Baskerville how dare you sir

845
01:02:12,853 --> 01:02:15,009
这样来占我妹妹的便宜!
make advances at my sister in such a fashion.

846
01:02:15,048 --> 01:02:15,682
杰克!
Jack!

847
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,122
我肯定我妹妹并没有做什么事情
I'm sure the lady gave you no reason

848
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:18,876
让你误会了她的好意吧?
to presume upon her good intentions.

849
01:02:18,917 --> 01:02:21,196
我们欢迎您加入我们的圈子 先生
We welcome you into our circle sir

850
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:22,351
而你却用这种让人厌恶的关心
and you repay the hospitality

851
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:24,814
来回报我们的热情
by forcing your disgusting attentions upon her.

852
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:25,818
不是的 我向你保证 先生
No but I assure you sir

853
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:28,530
-我的动机是纯洁高尚的 -滚吧 先生...滚回你老家去
-my intentions are honorable. -Away sir...away to the hall.

854
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:30,445
滚吧
Go on?

855
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:08,553
你好 华生
Hello Watson.

856
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,895
你是从哪儿冒出来的?
Where have you dropped from?

857
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:12,451
我跟踪了你
I took it upon myself to follow you.

858
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:17,003
我对福尔摩斯的承诺 比得体的行为更重要
I'm afraid my duty to Holmes overrode my tact.

859
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:20,357
我明白
I see.

860
01:03:21,147 --> 01:03:25,342
希望在格林盆没有人卖票 (让大伙儿来看我出丑)
Well hope they're not selling tickets in Grimpen.

861
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,442
我想你都看到了?
I assume you saw what happened?

862
01:03:36,039 --> 01:03:38,059
你觉不觉得这个当哥哥的
Did he ever strike you as a bit crazy

863
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:40,747
有些神经质?
this brother of hers?

864
01:03:40,787 --> 01:03:42,148
不太觉得
Not particularly.

865
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:44,028
我不明白他怎么会对我这样
I don't know why he does me.

866
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:45,873
是什么让他这么激动?
What's he getting so heated about?

867
01:03:45,913 --> 01:03:47,250
我当他的妹夫
What objection can he have

868
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:48,517
他有什么好反对的?
to me as a brother-in-law?

869
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,396
我是说他肯定不是反对我的身份
I mean he can't object to my worldly position

870
01:03:50,433 --> 01:03:54,432
那么...他反对的就是我这个人了
so it's got to be me myself.

871
01:03:54,473 --> 01:03:56,530
噢 我不明白
Oh I don't know.

872
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:57,298
你明白吗?
Do you see it?

873
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:58,691
不明白
Not at all.

874
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:00,215
我也是
Nor me.

875
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,907
谢谢
Well thanks.

876
01:04:02,654 --> 01:04:05,519
他一刻也不许我们在一起
He won't let us be together not for a moment.

877
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:08,654
他应该意识到才对
He must realize.

878
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:12,705
她眼里有一种光芒
You know what I don't understand

879
01:04:12,745 --> 01:04:14,634
胜过千言万语
there's a light in her eyes

880
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,430
我了解这种感觉...打心底里明白
that speaks louder than words.

881
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:20,413
可我不明白的是
I know it...I know it in my heart

882
01:04:21,003 --> 01:04:23,813
他把我当成了一个...
but he treats me as if I was a...

883
01:04:23,851 --> 01:04:28,089
一个闹剧里疯狂的色情骗子
if I was a mad seducer in an old melodrama.

884
01:04:28,131 --> 01:04:30,532
真是够荒谬的
Oh it's absurd.

885
01:04:31,247 --> 01:04:32,903
也许吧
Perhaps.

886
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:35,849
你说什么?
What?

887
01:04:35,888 --> 01:04:38,078
我是在想
I was just thinking

888
01:04:38,117 --> 01:04:40,680
有关这条猎犬事情
that this business with the hound

889
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,747
还有对这个家族的诅咒等等
and the family curse and so on;

890
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:46,409
要是斯泰普顿有些信以为真的话
if Stapleton partly believes it's true

891
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:50,213
也许他会因此不想让他妹妹嫁给你
perhaps he might want his sister not to be.

892
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,925
是啊 我明白了
Yes I know.

893
01:04:58,926 --> 01:05:01,861
等到这个事情解决了再说吧
Just till the business is resolved.

894
01:05:05,873 --> 01:05:07,715
好的
Yes of course.

895
01:05:07,828 --> 01:05:10,116
我们一起走回去吧
Well shall we walk home together?

896
01:05:21,357 --> 01:05:23,819
赖恩天文台
The Ryan Observatory please.

897
01:05:47,582 --> 01:05:50,710
我会永远为此对你感到抱歉
I am forever in your debt.

898
01:05:50,751 --> 01:05:52,464
噢 根本不必如此
Oh no not at all.

899
01:05:52,504 --> 01:05:54,562
日安
Well good day.

900
01:05:54,601 --> 01:05:56,762
日安 亨利爵士
Good day Sir Henry.

901
01:06:20,084 --> 01:06:21,824
好极了哦
Well well.

902
01:06:22,877 --> 01:06:24,036
发生什么事了?
What happened?

903
01:06:24,074 --> 01:06:25,920
斯泰普顿
Stapleton.

904
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,792
我还是觉得这家伙神经兮兮的
I still think the fellow's crazy

905
01:06:27,831 --> 01:06:30,610
可是他刚刚向我表达了
but he's just given me the most complete apology

906
01:06:30,651 --> 01:06:32,430
我这一辈子能听到的最由衷的歉意了
a man's ever likely received in his life

907
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:36,396
而且他还邀请我们明天去他那用餐 也就是星期五
and he's invited us to dinner tomorrow, Friday indeed.

908
01:06:36,433 --> 01:06:39,872
好啊 我很想去呢
Good I'll look forward to it.

909
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:44,810
格林盆的邮局
The post at Grimpen.

910
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:46,735
正是
Just so.

911
01:06:58,611 --> 01:07:00,755
谢谢 先生
Thank you sir.

912
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:08,879
我能跟您说句话吗 先生?
May I have a word sir?

913
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:09,871
当然可以
Of course.

914
01:08:13,124 --> 01:08:16,057
您...您对我们一直很好 先生
You...you've been very good to us sir

915
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:21,318
我愿意为您效犬马之劳
and I should like to do the best I can for you.

916
01:08:21,396 --> 01:08:23,303
我发现了一件事情 先生
There's something I found out sir.

917
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:25,554
什么?
Yes?

918
01:08:25,636 --> 01:08:28,325
我们是在聆讯后发现的
We found it after the inquest

919
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:32,806
我们谁也没告诉 不知该怎么说
hadn't told a mortal soul didn't know how.

920
01:08:32,882 --> 01:08:35,851
是有关查尔斯爵士之死 先生
It's about Sir Charles' death sir.

921
01:08:40,298 --> 01:08:41,995
你知道他是怎么死的吗?
You know how he died?

922
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:44,250
不 先生
No sir.

923
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:45,926
那是什么事?
Well what then?

924
01:08:46,007 --> 01:08:49,010
我知道那时他为什么会出现在大门口
I do know why he was at the gate at that hour.

925
01:08:49,082 --> 01:08:50,954
为什么?
Why?

926
01:08:51,031 --> 01:08:52,903
去跟一个女人会面 先生
To meet a woman sir.

927
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:54,095
女人?
Woman?

928
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:55,293

这边走 医生

964
01:11:48,774 --> 01:11:49,492
怎么回事呢?
How's that?

965

01:11:53,568 --> 01:11:55,422
她对她爸爸都做了些什么吗?

969
01:11:55,507 --> 01:11:57,519
这边走
This way.

嫁给了一个骗子 先生

一个艺术家

972

所谓的艺术家
so called,

973
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:04,720
不是那种艺术家

974
01:12:04,759 --> 01:12:06,004
那种艺术家能挣钱养活自己
that artist earned his living.

975
01:12:06,042 --> 01:12:08,346
她的那个艺术家太伟大了 伟大到无法出去挣钱

976
01:12:08,428 --> 01:12:09,083
艺术家?

罗拉 莱茵斯

他追的是她的钱...其实是我的钱

983
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:23,254
上周在芬尼沃斯他们焚烧了我的肖像
I was burned in effigy in Fernworthy last week.

984
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:24,792
我记得你曾经预言过会发生这样的事情
You predicted that I remember.

985
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:28,685
一点没错 因为我知道这里执法机关办事拖拉
Exactly so because I know the slackness of authority here abouts.

986
01:12:28,766 --> 01:12:30,394
我对政府的诉讼案
A case of Frankland v. Regina

987
01:12:30,473 --> 01:12:33,167
将会引起公众的关注
will bring the matter of all the attention to the public.

988
01:12:33,244 --> 01:12:34,872
我告诉过警方
I told the police they would have occasion

989
01:12:34,952 --> 01:12:36,172
他们那样对待我迟早会后悔的
to regret their treatment of me

990
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,123
而我的话现在已经应验了

991
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:40,177
怎么回事?
How so?

992
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:42,906
我可以告诉他们一件 他们迫切想知道的事情
I could tell them what they are dying to know.

993
01:12:42,983 --> 01:12:43,863
可你并不打算这样做吧?
But you're not going to?

994
01:12:43,941 --> 01:12:45,126
当然不
Certainly not.

995
01:12:45,207 --> 01:12:46,731
是偷猎之类的事情吗?
Some case of poaching?

996

偷猎 哼 胡说八道
Poaching fiddlesticks.

997
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:52,713
是那个逃犯塞尔丹 先生 那个疯狂的刺客
The convict sir, Selden, the mad stabber.

998
01:12:52,796 --> 01:12:54,528
你该不会是说你知道他在哪儿吧?
You don't mean to say you know where he is?

999
01:12:54,604 --> 01:12:56,746
差不多吧
Near enough.

1000
01:12:56,828 --> 01:12:58,422
警方从来就没想到
It has never occurred to the police

1001
01:12:58,504 --> 01:12:59,967
抓住这个人的最好方法就是
that the way to catch the man

1002
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:01,913
找出他食物的来源
was to find out where he got his food

1003
01:13:01,988 --> 01:13:03,546
再顺藤摸瓜去抓他
and so trace it to him.

1004
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:04,849
白瑞摩
Barrymore.

1005
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:06,836
他的食物是由一个小孩送去的
His food is taken to him by a child.

1006
01:13:06,911 --> 01:13:08,096
小孩?
A child?

1007
01:13:08,176 --> 01:13:09,466
对啊
Why not?

1008
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:12,605
我观察了这孩子一个多星期了
I have observed the child for more than a week.

1009
01:13:14,911 --> 01:13:16,237
小孩的本性天真
It is in the nature of children

1010
01:13:16,311 --> 01:13:18,453
很容易对错误的对象忠心耿耿
to form perverse allegiances.

1011
01:13:18,533 --> 01:13:20,708
但是事情当然更有可能是
But surely it's more likely to be

1012
01:13:20,788 --> 01:13:23,139
沼地牧人的儿子
the child of a moorland shepherd

1013
01:13:23,216 --> 01:13:24,436
给他父亲送饭罢了
taking him his lunch.

1014
01:13:24,515 --> 01:13:26,247
如果是放牧的话 地点是常有变化的

01:14:15,102 --> 01:14:16,292

1024
01:14:18,282 --> 01:14:19,608

1025
01:14:19,683 --> 01:14:21,590
今天工人们都不在
The laborers aren't here today.

1026
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:25,449
真是非常漂亮
It is quite, quite beautiful.

1027
01:14:41,662 --> 01:14:43,032
如果这世上还有一种我不能容忍的动物的话
If there's one animal on this planet,

1028
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,466
那应该就是兔子了
which I cannot abide, it is a rabbit.

1029
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:47,699
为啥?
Really?

1030
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,070
兔子老是挖地洞
Rabbit's burrow.

1031
01:14:49,147 --> 01:14:49,881
你有没有想过
Have you any conception

1032
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:50,978
一窝兔子
of what a family of rabbits

1033
01:14:51,016 --> 01:14:54,022
一夜之间就能对挖掘工作造成的破坏吗?
can do to the chronology of a dig in a single night?

1034
01:14:57,009 --> 01:14:59,081
你是要到墓地去 对吧?
You were on your way to Necropolis.

1035
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:00,964
要是你愿意的话 我可以带你去参观
I could show you around if you like.

1036
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:03,321
墓地?
The Necropolis?

1037
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,507
很多人认为那是一个新石器时代的村落
Most people think it an in Neolithic village

1038
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:08,009
但是我有理由认为那是一个墓地
but I have reason to believe that a burial ground

1039
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:10,060
有着一些非常有趣的特征
some most interesting features.

1040
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:12,588
很高兴有你陪伴

是谁?
Who is it?

1043
01:15:16,253 --> 01:15:17,915
是那个亨利爵士一到这儿
It's the man who has been at Sir Henry's heels

1044
01:15:17,997 --> 01:15:19,460
就开始跟踪他的人
since he landed here.

1045
01:15:19,535 --> 01:15:22,575
我觉得他心怀不轨
I can't think his motives are benevolent so

1046
01:15:22,645 --> 01:15:25,030
所以要是你能来 再带上你擅长使用的那把枪
if you come I shall be obliged

1047
01:15:25,107 --> 01:15:28,587
我将感激不尽
if you bring that gun you handle so well.

1048
01:15:28,661 --> 01:15:30,219
也许会有危险
There may be some danger.

1049
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:31,730
如果有危险的话
If there's to be danger

1050
01:15:31,805 --> 01:15:35,346
两把枪总比一把强
then 2 guns will be better than one.

是的
Yes.

也是我的病人之一

1055

她住在库柏特斯
She lives in Coombe-Tracey.

1056

He's cut her off you know without a penny.

1057
01:15:48,246 --> 01:15:50,901

1058
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,643
噢 那倒是有可能

1059
01:15:52,723 --> 01:15:54,083
她的婚姻出现问题之后
After her marriage went wrong

她开始出去工作
she was able to set up for herself

01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,666
当打字员挣点薪水
in a small way as a typist.

1062
01:15:57,749 --> 01:15:59,693
也许工作是查尔斯爵士帮她找的
Sir Charles may have made that possible.

1063
01:15:59,765 --> 01:16:01,940
他为不少慈善事业捐资
He was a man who fostered many good causes.

1064
01:16:02,021 --> 01:16:04,033
她也许就是受资助者之一
She may have been one of them.

1065
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,351
莱茵斯是怎样的一位画家?

1066

'华生医生在赖福特庄园'

1068
01:17:46,376 --> 01:17:47,141
也许那位神秘人所跟踪的人
Perhaps it is you

1069
01:17:47,181 --> 01:17:49,241
就是你
who's been dogged by this secret man.

1070
01:17:49,316 --> 01:17:51,293
而并非亨利爵士
Not Sir Henry at all.

1071
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:55,972
我们该怎么做?
What do we do?

1072
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,994

当我看见一个雪茄烟头
When I see a cigarette stub

1078
01:18:50,412 --> 01:18:53,101
牌子是布莱德雷 牛津街

那枪要小心点哦
Be careful with that gun.

1081
01:19:02,681 --> 01:19:04,378
我还以为你在贝克街
I thought you were in Baker Street

1082
01:19:04,459 --> 01:19:06,600
忙着那起勒索案呢
working on that case of blackmail?

1083
01:19:06,681 --> 01:19:09,303
我就是想让你这样认为
That's what I wished you to think.

1084
01:19:15,634 --> 01:19:17,331
你该对我有更好的印象 福尔摩斯
I've deserved better at your hands Holmes.

1085
01:19:17,411 --> 01:19:19,039
你利用我又不信任我
You used me and do not trust me.

1086
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:20,409
呃 要是我出现了
Well my presence would have warned

1087
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,184
我们的厉害对手就会警惕起来
our very formidable opponents

1088
01:19:22,264 --> 01:19:23,070
提防着我们
and put them in our guard.

1089
01:19:23,111 --> 01:19:25,227
有必要让你和亨利爵士认为
It was essential that you and Sir Henry

1090
01:19:25,306 --> 01:19:26,934
我一直在伦敦
believed me to be in London all the time

1091
01:19:27,015 --> 01:19:27,800
那样你们的行为才不会露馅儿
and behaved accordingly.

1092
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,325
摩梯末医生
Doctor Mortimer.

1093
01:19:29,408 --> 01:19:30,288
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

1094
01:19:30,364 --> 01:19:31,584
你在德文郡呆了多久了?
How long have you been in Devon?

1095
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:35,518
我来的第二天晚上你就看见我了
Right after you saw me on my second night

1096
01:19:35,592 --> 01:19:36,918
当时我真是很蠢
when I was foolish enough

1097
01:19:36,995 --> 01:19:39,450
竟然站在月光下
to show myself against the moon.

1098
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,363
那我的报告全都白费了?
All of my reports have been wasted.

1099
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:44,163
并非都是白费的
Not all of them you know.

1100
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,625
都在这儿呢
Here they are

1101
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,936
我向你保证我都认真拜读了
and very well thumbed I assure you.

1102
01:19:50,016 --> 01:19:54,067
我还不得不贿赂这里的邮局呢
I had to subvert the local post office.

1103
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:56,805
干得好 亲爱的朋友
Brilliant my dear fellow,

1104
01:19:56,884 --> 01:20:00,364
真是太好了
brilliant.

1105
01:20:00,438 --> 01:20:01,979
我知道你们肯定有好多事要商谈
You must, I know, have much to discuss

1106
01:20:02,019 --> 01:20:03,848
而我也得回家了
and I must be getting home.

1107
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:06,170
我还有个问题 福尔摩斯先生
Please one question Mr. Holmes.

1108
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:08,260
您是不是快发现
Are you any closer to discovering what,

1109
01:20:08,334 --> 01:20:10,712
那条所谓的猎犬到底是什么了?
if anything, the hound is?

1110
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:15,708
是的
I am.

1111
01:20:15,785 --> 01:20:17,343
它真的存在吗?
Does it exist?

1112
01:20:20,535 --> 01:20:23,700
确实存在
It does.

1113
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:25,992
谢谢 摩梯末医生
Thank you Dr. Mortimer.

1114
01:20:26,069 --> 01:20:28,931
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

1115
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:30,265
日安 华生医生
Good day Doctor Watson.

1116
01:20:30,343 --> 01:20:33,205
谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for your help.

1117
01:20:33,283 --> 01:20:36,519
让我看看我能给你点什么吃的
Now let me see what meager refreshment I can provide.

1118
01:20:42,475 --> 01:20:45,407
卡怀特 听差所的那个小男孩
Cartwright, the little chap from the express office,

1119
01:20:45,484 --> 01:20:48,276
我把他带到这儿来了
I brought him down with me

1120
01:20:48,354 --> 01:20:50,705
以满足我简单的日常需要
to look after my simple wants.

1121
01:20:50,781 --> 01:20:52,887
一条面包和一条干净的衬领就足够了
A loaf of bread and a clean collar.

1122
01:20:52,968 --> 01:20:54,362
我发现有个住在库柏特斯的女人
I've discovered that there's a woman

1123
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:57,439
名字的缩写就是L.L.
Iiving in Coombe-Tracey with the initials L.L.

1124
01:20:57,513 --> 01:21:00,749
噢 是的 弗兰克兰的女儿罗拉 莱茵斯
Awe yes Frankland's daughter, Lora Lyons.

1125
01:21:00,828 --> 01:21:03,586
我们调查方向一致啊
Our research has been running along the same lines.

1126
01:21:05,647 --> 01:21:06,420
你知道
Did you know that she's

1127
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:08,915
她正打算跟她的丈夫离婚吗?
seeking a divorce from her husband?

1128
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:10,728
但她却没有钱来打离婚官司
But she lacks the means to carry it through.

1129
01:21:10,808 --> 01:21:11,958
那笔费用可不菲
It is a costly business.

1130
01:21:12,039 --> 01:21:13,365
尝尝我的炖菜
Do try my stew.

1131
01:21:13,441 --> 01:21:16,480
噢 摩梯末医生认为查尔斯爵士
Awe, now Dr. Mortimer thought that Sir Charles

1132
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:19,075
应该是她背后的捐助人
might have been a discreet benefactor.

1133
01:21:19,148 --> 01:21:21,184
是嘛?
Really?

1134
01:21:21,267 --> 01:21:22,253
有意思
That's interesting.

1135
01:21:22,326 --> 01:21:23,511
吃吧 华生
Please Watson.

1136
01:21:28,169 --> 01:21:33,048
很恶心哎 福尔摩斯
Its quite disgusting Holmes.

1137
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,485
是的
Yes.

1138
01:21:34,561 --> 01:21:37,868
是的  没错
Yes it is.

1139
01:21:37,945 --> 01:21:40,528
呃 趁热吃更好吃
Well it's better when it's hot.

1140
01:21:40,611 --> 01:21:41,831
你知道吗? 罗拉 莱茵斯
Did you know there was a close intimacy

1141
01:21:41,909 --> 01:21:43,372
和那个昆虫学家斯泰普顿
between Lora Lyons

1142
01:21:43,446 --> 01:21:45,526
两人关系亲密
and the entomologist, Stapleton?

1143
01:21:45,566 --> 01:21:46,976
我不知道
No I did not.

1144
01:21:47,014 --> 01:21:49,999
是的 他们私会还相互通信
Yes they meet, they write.

1145
01:21:50,078 --> 01:21:52,940
她无疑正指望成为他的太太
She's no doubt counting on becoming his wife.

1146
01:21:53,016 --> 01:21:55,599
这是我们手中最有力的武器了
That is the most powerful weapon in our hands.

1147
01:21:55,682 --> 01:21:56,527
怎么回事?
How?

1148
01:21:56,605 --> 01:21:58,034
我不明白
I don't understand.

1149
01:21:58,108 --> 01:21:59,537
因为事实上斯泰普顿小姐
Because Miss Stapleton is in reality

1150
01:21:59,612 --> 01:22:01,997
是斯泰普顿的妻子 而不是他妹妹
Stapleton's wife not his sister.

1151
01:22:02,072 --> 01:22:03,257
他的妻子?
His wife?

1152
01:22:03,337 --> 01:22:05,653
往诺森布兰德旅馆 给我们发来警告的
Yes it was she who sent us that warning

1153
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:07,230
正是她
to the Northumberland Hotel.

1154
01:22:07,302 --> 01:22:09,245
为什么要如此精心地欺骗我们呢?
Why this elaborate deception?

1155
01:22:09,318 --> 01:22:10,608
别问我细节 华生
Don't ask me the particulars Watson

1156
01:22:10,684 --> 01:22:13,209
不过这是一起谋杀
but it is murder.

1157
01:22:13,282 --> 01:22:16,996
一起精心策划的冷酷的故意谋杀
Refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder.

1158
01:22:17,075 --> 01:22:19,799
你是怎么得出这个结论的?
What led you to it?

1159
01:22:19,878 --> 01:22:22,263
他是一位真正的昆虫学家
He is a genuine entomologist.

1160
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,846
但是他唯一的一次声明
But that mention of his sole, claim to fame,

1161
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,285
是他发现了兰凯尼迪蝶亚种
his discovery of a subspecies Lycanidi

1162
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,166
那对于他来说恰好是致命的证据
that was his fatal moment.

1163
01:22:33,241 --> 01:22:37,199
因为一个物种只能有一个发现者
There can only be one discoverer of a species.

1164
01:22:37,273 --> 01:22:39,553
这就暴露了他
That pinpointed him.

1165
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:41,053
真是一次很辛苦的追踪...
It has been a hard trail...

1166
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:55,034
快
Quickly.

1167
01:23:11,348 --> 01:23:12,811
是亨利爵士
It's Sir Henry.

1168
01:23:36,125 --> 01:23:40,864
是塞尔丹
It's Selden.

1169
01:23:40,944 --> 01:23:45,380
是亨利爵士的衣服 把这可怜的恶棍送上了西天
Sir Henry's clothes were the poor devils death.

1170
01:23:45,663 --> 01:23:48,393
真是个可怜的恶棍
Poor devil indeed.

1171
01:23:48,463 --> 01:23:51,255
事实上都不成人样了
There's only a half-life in truth.

1172
01:23:51,334 --> 01:23:54,849
暂时不能让任何人知道
No one must know for the moment.

1173
01:23:54,922 --> 01:23:56,584
我们必须把尸体藏起来
We must hide the body.

1174
01:24:15,463 --> 01:24:19,212
不能让亨利爵士知道这条猎犬的事
Sir Henry must know nothing of hearing the hound.

1175
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:20,113
这样他才会有更好的勇气
He'll have a better nerve

1176
01:24:20,154 --> 01:24:25,020
去经受明天的考验
for the ordeal he must undergo tomorrow.

1177
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:29,363
这就是巴斯克维尔庄园了?
So this is Baskerville Hall?

1178
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:38,623
请稍等一会儿
One moment please.

1179
01:25:19,303 --> 01:25:21,339
看这是谁?
Who?

1180
01:25:21,423 --> 01:25:25,381
是斯泰普顿!
It's Stapleton!

1181
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,360
他也是巴斯克维尔家的人
He's a Baskerville.

1182
01:25:30,172 --> 01:25:31,834
查尔斯爵士的弟弟
Sir Charles' brother,

1183
01:25:31,916 --> 01:25:33,578
在哥斯达黎加死于黄热病的那个
who died of yellow fever in Costa Rica,

1184
01:25:33,657 --> 01:25:35,460
他并非没有后裔
did not die childless.

1185
01:25:35,537 --> 01:25:38,576
我们逮到他了 华生 我们逮到他了
We have him Watson, we have him.

1186
01:25:38,647 --> 01:25:40,788
我发誓 到明天晚上
And I do swear that by tomorrow night

1187
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:42,428
他就会落入我们的网中
he will be fluttering in our net

1188
01:25:42,508 --> 01:25:44,824
像他的蝴蝶那样无助地挣扎
as helpless as well as his own butterflies.

1189
01:26:00,212 --> 01:26:02,737
华生和我得去伦敦一趟
I feel that Watson and I must go to London.

1190
01:26:04,895 --> 01:26:06,453
伦敦?
London?

1191
01:26:06,536 --> 01:26:08,198
我觉得在这儿节骨眼上
I think we will be more useful there

1192
01:26:08,279 --> 01:26:10,011
我们在那儿会更有用
at this present juncture.

1193
01:26:15,353 --> 01:26:18,518
抱歉
Excuse me.

1194
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,741
可以给我来杯新鲜的咖啡吗?
Might I have some fresh coffee?

1195
01:26:20,819 --> 01:26:22,179
当然了 先生
Certainly sir.

1196
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:22,974
可我还以为
But I thought you were going

1197
01:26:23,013 --> 01:26:24,742
你是打算来帮我渡过难关的
to see me through this business?

1198
01:26:33,330 --> 01:26:35,575
相信我 亲爱的朋友
Trust me my dear fellow.

1199
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:38,994
我相信
I do.

1200
01:26:39,070 --> 01:26:40,958
告诉斯泰普顿
Tell Stapleton that I would have been happy

1201
01:26:40,998 --> 01:26:41,640
我本来很乐意陪你一同前往的
to come with you

1202
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:45,454
可是有急事需要我去城里一趟
but the urgent business requires me to be in town.

1203
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,326
我不明白
I don't understand

1204
01:26:47,365 --> 01:26:48,839
难道我不能跟你们一起去伦敦吗?
should I not come with you to London?

1205
01:26:48,914 --> 01:26:50,274
为什么要我单独留下?
Why should I stay here alone?

1206
01:26:50,349 --> 01:26:52,325
不行 你必须留下
No you must stay

1207
01:26:52,398 --> 01:26:54,374
而且一定要按我说的去做
and do exactly as I tell you.

1208
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,729
我当然会
Of course I will.

1209
01:26:56,809 --> 01:26:58,950
开车去梅利琵庄园
Drive to Merripit House,

1210
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:00,689
再把车打发回来
send the truck back and let it be known

1211
01:27:00,728 --> 01:27:04,833
让大家以为你要步行回家
that you intend to walk home.

1212
01:27:07,334 --> 01:27:08,996
穿过沼地吗?
Across the moor?

1213
01:27:12,323 --> 01:27:13,881
在晚上?
At night?

1214
01:27:13,965 --> 01:27:15,837
如果我对你的胆识和勇气
If I had not every confidence

1215
01:27:15,913 --> 01:27:17,716
没有足够的信心的话
in your nerve and courage

1216
01:27:17,793 --> 01:27:20,073
我是不会建议你那样做的
I would not suggest it.

1217
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:24,821
你必须得这样做
It is essential that you do this.

1218
01:27:24,901 --> 01:27:27,625
我会按你说的做
Then I will do just what you say.

1219
01:27:27,704 --> 01:27:29,167
走小路
Take the path.

1220
01:27:29,242 --> 01:27:32,070
一定要走从梅利琵庄园 到格林盆大路的那条小路
Exactly on the path from Merripit House

1221
01:27:32,147 --> 01:27:35,072
就是你回家通常会走的那条路线
to the Grimpen Road, it is your natural way home.

1222
01:27:37,957 --> 01:27:39,551
你们打算什么时候走?
And when do you intend to leave?

1223
01:27:43,323 --> 01:27:47,350
早餐后就动身
Immediately after breakfast.

1224
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:48,504
谢谢 白瑞摩
Thank you Barrymore.

1225
01:27:48,585 --> 01:27:49,595
不用谢 先生
Sir.

1226
01:29:01,073 --> 01:29:02,433
你是莱茵斯太太吗?
Mrs. Lyons?

1227
01:29:02,508 --> 01:29:03,458
是的
Yes.

1228
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:12,445
你承认是你要求查尔斯爵士
So you admit that you asked Sir Charles

1229
01:29:12,524 --> 01:29:14,769
十点钟在门口见面
to meet you at the gate at ten o'clock

1230
01:29:14,846 --> 01:29:16,987
而你却说你没有赴约?
but you say that you did not keep the appointment?

1231
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:18,216
我没去
I did not.

1232
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:22,664
你知道那是他死亡的确切时间吗?
You do realize that was the very hour of his death?

1233
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:25,126
你是在指控我吗 先生?
Is that an accusation sir?

1234
01:29:25,202 --> 01:29:27,273
不 不是的
No, no.

1235
01:29:27,356 --> 01:29:30,663
我只不过是在问你
I'm merely asking if you can forge a connection

1236
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:32,507
是否能推断出这两者间有什么联系
between the two events.

1237
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:35,133
没有什么联系
There is no connection.

1238
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:40,269
莱茵斯太太  我们认为这是一起谋杀
Mrs. Lyons we believe this to be a case of murder

1239
01:29:40,342 --> 01:29:41,866
而证据正指向
and the evidence may implicate

1240
01:29:41,948 --> 01:29:44,368
你的朋友斯泰普顿先生
not only your friend Mr. Stapleton

1241
01:29:44,443 --> 01:29:46,246
还有他的太太
but his wife as well.

1242
01:29:46,324 --> 01:29:49,386
他太太?
His wife?

1243
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,703
莱茵斯太太  他所谓的妹妹
Mrs. Lyons the person who has passed for his sister

1244
01:29:52,782 --> 01:29:54,956
其实是他的妻子
is really his wife.

1245
01:29:58,969 --> 01:30:00,841
他妻子?
His wife?

1246
01:31:05,065 --> 01:31:06,459
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

1247
01:31:10,532 --> 01:31:15,004
斯泰普顿承诺
Mr. Stapleton offered me marriage

1248
01:31:15,077 --> 01:31:16,949
如果我能跟我丈夫离婚
on condition that I could obtain a divorce

1249
01:31:17,025 --> 01:31:18,828
就会娶我为妻
from my husband.

1250
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,618
他告诉我...
He told me...

1251
01:31:25,229 --> 01:31:28,434
他怎么能骗我呢!
how he has lied.

1252
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:32,736
他一而再再而三地欺骗我
He has lied and lied and lied.

1253
01:31:35,415 --> 01:31:37,426
我干嘛还要真心对他呢?
Why should I preserve faith with him

1254
01:31:37,499 --> 01:31:40,431
他根本就没有真心对我!
he never kept any with me?

1255
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:45,020
你们尽管问吧
Ask me what you will.

1256
01:31:45,059 --> 01:31:48,119
我不会有任何隐瞒
There is nothing I shall hold back.

1257
01:31:48,195 --> 01:31:50,475
你说查尔斯爵士帮你
You have said Sir Charles helped you

1258
01:31:50,554 --> 01:31:53,593
当上了专职的打字员
to set yourself up as a professional typist,

1259
01:31:53,663 --> 01:31:57,714
大概是在你丈夫弃你而去之后的事吧
presumably that was after your husband deserted you.

1260
01:31:57,798 --> 01:31:59,834
是的
Yes.

1261
01:31:59,916 --> 01:32:04,142
查尔斯爵士知道我父亲是不会帮我的
Sir Charles knew my father would not help me.

1262
01:32:04,225 --> 01:32:06,366
有件事情我得向您发誓
One thing I swear to you,

1263
01:32:06,445 --> 01:32:07,805
我写那封信的时候
when I wrote the letter

1264
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:10,265
压根就没想要伤害那位老人
I never dreamed of any harm to the old gentleman

1265
01:32:10,340 --> 01:32:13,953
他一直是我最仁慈的朋友
who had been my kindest friend.

1266
01:32:15,945 --> 01:32:18,947
我完全相信你 夫人
I entirely believe you madam.

1267
01:32:19,023 --> 01:32:20,966
查尔斯爵士是不是请斯泰普顿
And Sir Charles used Stapleton

1268
01:32:21,038 --> 01:32:23,970
出面做这件事?
as an intermediary?

1269
01:32:24,045 --> 01:32:27,586
因为他不想人们知道他的善行
He did not like to be seen to be doing good.

1270
01:32:27,666 --> 01:32:29,294
在查尔斯爵士死亡的当天
And the letter that you sent to Sir Charles

1271
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,877
你写给他的那封信呢?
on the day of his death?

1272
01:32:33,854 --> 01:32:37,603
我离婚需要钱
I needed money for my divorce.

1273
01:32:37,683 --> 01:32:40,173
我听说他要去伦敦了
I had heard he was leaving for London.

1274
01:32:40,246 --> 01:32:44,369
寄信的主意是斯泰普顿出的吧?
And the sending of the letter was suggested by Stapleton?

1275
01:32:44,449 --> 01:32:46,425
那封信是他口述的
He dictated it.

1276
01:32:48,586 --> 01:32:50,283
他的理由是
The reason he gave

1277
01:32:50,361 --> 01:32:51,955
查尔斯爵士会帮我
was that Sir Charles would help

1278
01:32:52,037 --> 01:32:55,099
支付我离婚所需的诉讼费用
with the legal expenses of my divorce.

1279
01:32:56,923 --> 01:32:59,405
是他阻止你去赴约的吗?
And he dissuaded you from keeping the appointment?

1280
01:33:01,469 --> 01:33:04,741
还让我发誓一个字也不要说出去
And swore me to silence concerning it.

1281
01:33:04,819 --> 01:33:05,735
他说这起死亡
He said that the death

1282
01:33:05,772 --> 01:33:07,544
是一起非常神秘的事件
had been a very mysterious one

1283
01:33:07,584 --> 01:33:09,729
要是人们知道了事实
and that I should certainly be suspected

1284
01:33:09,807 --> 01:33:13,624
我自然会受到怀疑
were the facts to become known.

1285
01:33:13,704 --> 01:33:16,672
他吓唬我要我保持沉默
He frightened me into silence.

1286
01:33:18,798 --> 01:33:25,448
你差点就犯罪了 莱茵斯太太
A very fortunate escape Mrs. Lyons.

1287
01:33:25,529 --> 01:33:28,591
你一直处在危险的边缘
You have been near the edge of the precipice.

1288
01:33:36,088 --> 01:33:37,926
学犯罪学的学生们应该记得
Students of criminology will remember

1289
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:40,076
66年在"小俄罗斯"(位于托特汉姆一带 俄罗斯移民聚集地)的格兰德
the incidents in Grodno, in Little Russia,

1290
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:41,771
所发生的那些案件
in the year '66, and of course

1291
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:46,404
当然还有北卡罗莱纳州的安德森谋杀案
there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina,

1292
01:33:46,479 --> 01:33:47,984
但这起案件
but this case possesses features

1293
01:33:48,024 --> 01:33:52,586
绝对是独一无二
which are entirely its own.

1294
01:33:54,408 --> 01:33:56,622
华生医生告诉我你枪法不错
Dr. Watson tells me that you handle a gun.

1295
01:33:56,698 --> 01:33:59,049
算是个神枪手吧
I'm a fairly proficient.

1296
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:00,857
嗯 最初是你
Well it was you, who first,

1297
01:34:00,937 --> 01:34:03,392
让我们开始注意这起案件的
brought this case to our attention.

1298
01:34:03,464 --> 01:34:06,432
案件的高潮怎么能没有你的参与呢?
Isn't it right that you'd be with us at the climax?

1299
01:34:10,299 --> 01:34:11,216
谢谢
Thank you.

1300
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,626
摩梯末医生和我看守这条小道的时候
While Dr. Mortimer and I guard the path

1301
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,432
你负责看着那座房子 华生
you watch the house Watson.

1302
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,569
我不喜欢这样
I don't like it.

1303
01:35:07,648 --> 01:35:09,893
起雾了
There's fog in the air.

1304
01:35:09,973 --> 01:35:12,147
洼地里已经雾蒙蒙了
It's in the hollows already.

1305
01:35:17,252 --> 01:35:18,646
小心点 华生
Be careful Watson.

1306
01:35:29,829 --> 01:35:32,319
你能来我太高兴了
I'm so pleased you could come.

1307
01:35:32,391 --> 01:35:34,940
华生医生得回伦敦去真是太遗憾了
It's a pity Dr. Watson had to return to London.

1308
01:35:35,023 --> 01:35:36,252
但是我相信
Nevertheless I'm sure we'll have

1309
01:35:36,291 --> 01:35:37,779
我们今晚在一起会过得很愉快的
a pleasant evening together.

1310
01:35:55,631 --> 01:35:59,205
抱歉我得离开一会儿 亨利爵士
If you'd excuse me for a moment Sir Henry.

1311
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:00,206
我很快回来
I shant be long.

1312
01:36:08,856 --> 01:36:11,311
救命!
Help!

1313
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:13,635
救命!
Help!

1314
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:15,035
救救我!
Please!

1315
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:19,788
请救救我啊!
Help me Please!

1316
01:36:44,674 --> 01:36:48,667
我离开的时候亨利爵士还在屋子里
Sir Henry was still inside the house when I left.

1317
01:36:48,741 --> 01:36:50,067
天色越来越暗了
It's getting late.

1318
01:36:52,363 --> 01:36:53,826
你是说贝莉 斯泰普顿不在那儿吗?
You said Beryl Stapleton was not there?

1319
01:36:53,902 --> 01:36:54,946
不在
No.

1320
01:36:55,030 --> 01:36:56,658
我想不出她能在哪儿
I cannot think where she might be

1321
01:36:56,738 --> 01:36:59,600
晚餐桌只摆了两个人的位子
and there were only 2 places laid for dinner.

1322
01:36:59,677 --> 01:37:02,609
雾气一直在加重
That fog is getting thicker all the time.

1323
01:37:02,684 --> 01:37:05,209
鼓起勇气 亨利爵士
Courage Sir Henry.

1324
01:37:05,283 --> 01:37:07,121
勇敢些!
Brave it.

1325
01:37:36,895 --> 01:37:38,256
来了
It's coming.

1326
01:38:22,315 --> 01:38:24,047
你是一个勇敢的人
You're a brave man.

1327
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,973
医生
Doctor?

1328
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:28,864
没事的 亨利爵士
It's all right Sir Henry.

1329
01:38:28,945 --> 01:38:32,110
没事了
It's all right.

1330
01:38:32,192 --> 01:38:34,916
那猎犬窜到我们前头去了
The hound got past us

1331
01:38:34,994 --> 01:38:38,194
你要是还撑的住的话
now if you can manage it

1332
01:38:38,277 --> 01:38:40,895
我们必须尽快回到那屋子里去
we must get back to the house as soon as possible.

1333
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:46,400
竟然是磷?
Phosphorus?

1334
01:38:58,782 --> 01:38:59,559
不
No.

1335
01:38:59,635 --> 01:39:00,515
先生 不行
Sir no.

1336
01:39:00,593 --> 01:39:02,151
先生
Sir.

1337
01:39:02,232 --> 01:39:03,558
我抗议 先生
I protest sir.

1338
01:39:03,634 --> 01:39:05,808
先生 你不可以...
Sir you are not allowed.

1339
01:39:05,892 --> 01:39:06,703
华生!
Watson?

1340
01:39:10,162 --> 01:39:12,745
停下 先生 停下
Stop sir stop.

1341
01:39:42,595 --> 01:39:43,815
门锁住了
The door's locked.

1342
01:39:43,894 --> 01:39:45,357
救命!
Help!

1343
01:39:45,432 --> 01:39:46,956
救救我!
Help me!

1344
01:39:47,038 --> 01:39:48,501
救命!
Help!

1345
01:39:48,576 --> 01:39:50,519
救我!
Please help!

1346
01:39:50,593 --> 01:39:52,022
在里头!
In here!

1347
01:39:52,095 --> 01:39:53,455
救命!
Help!

1348
01:40:05,391 --> 01:40:06,820
她伤得很重
She's badly hurt.

1349
01:40:14,243 --> 01:40:16,011
畜生!
The brute.

1350
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:44,174
你没事了
You're all right.

1351
01:40:54,570 --> 01:40:58,558
我以为他爱我
I thought this man loved me.

1352
01:40:58,637 --> 01:41:00,509
他什么也不爱!
He loves nothing!

1353
01:41:03,252 --> 01:41:04,646
他在哪儿?
Where is he?

1354
01:41:04,722 --> 01:41:05,872
警方已...
The police have...

1355
01:41:05,952 --> 01:41:07,172
他跑了
He escaped.

1356
01:41:11,283 --> 01:41:13,972
他会去沼地中他的那个小岛
He'll go to his island in the mire.

1357
01:41:46,486 --> 01:41:48,976
我必须小心
I must take care.

1358
01:41:49,048 --> 01:41:50,886
非常小心
Great care.

1359
01:41:53,728 --> 01:41:55,122
不
No.

1360
01:41:59,299 --> 01:42:01,275
不
No.

1361
01:42:08,118 --> 01:42:10,087
救命
Help me.

1362
01:42:10,169 --> 01:42:13,579
有人吗 救我啊!
Please somebody help me!

1363
01:42:25,957 --> 01:42:27,142
救命!
Help me!

1364
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:46,842
福尔摩斯确定
Holmes had established that Stapleton

1365
01:42:46,882 --> 01:42:49,527
斯泰普顿的这条狗是他从玛格兰仕...
had bought the dog from Mangles of the...

1366
01:42:49,607 --> 01:42:54,486
伦敦弗汉姆路的罗斯&玛格兰仕店中买下
Ross and Mangles of the Fulham Road in London.

1367
01:42:54,563 --> 01:42:59,442
伦敦弗汉姆路的罗斯&玛格兰仕店中买下
Ross and Mangles of the Fulham Road in London.

1368
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:04,334
他带着它沿着德文郡的北线走
He took it on the north Devon line

1369
01:43:04,374 --> 01:43:05,515
走了很长的路程
and walked a great distance

1370
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:06,410
穿过沼地到了他的家
over to the moor to his home,

1371
01:43:06,450 --> 01:43:07,478
正如我们所知道的
as we know he eventually kenneled it

1372
01:43:07,518 --> 01:43:10,644
他最后把它养在格林盆沼地中央
at the heart of the Grimpen Mire.

1373
01:43:10,729 --> 01:43:12,323
格林盆沼地
Of the Grimpen Mire.

1374
01:43:12,403 --> 01:43:14,443
如果那畜生把亨利爵士撕成碎片
How on earth did he expect

1375
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:16,015
他到底打算怎么
to claim the inheritance if this creature

1376
01:43:16,097 --> 01:43:17,865
来宣称他对遗产的继承权呢?
had mauled Sir Henry to death?

1377
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:20,698
撕成碎片 用词很好 华生
Mauled, very good word Watson.

1378
01:43:20,776 --> 01:43:22,882
通过一些中间机构
Through intermediaries Baron Stapleton said

1379
01:43:22,965 --> 01:43:25,827
巴罗 斯泰普顿说他打算回到中美洲去
that he intended to return to Central America

1380
01:43:25,903 --> 01:43:27,846
通过英国政府机构
and conduct his claim upon the estate

1381
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:29,991
确认他是巴斯克维尔家族后人的身份
from the depths of Costa Rica.

1382
01:43:30,073 --> 01:43:32,762
再从哥斯达黎加内陆
Having established his identity as a Baskerville

1383
01:43:32,842 --> 01:43:34,818
发来他对遗产继承权的声明
through the British authorities there.

1384
01:43:34,891 --> 01:43:36,519
当然他对房产是没有什么兴趣的
Of course he had no interest in the estate.

1385
01:43:36,599 --> 01:43:38,437
他只不过是想要钱
He simply wanted the money.

1386
01:43:38,516 --> 01:43:40,015
靴子的事情又是怎么回事?
What about the boot?

1387
01:43:40,086 --> 01:43:40,762
他偷了靴子
He stole the boot presumably

1388
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,254
大概是想要亨利爵士衣物中的一件物品
to have an article of Sir Henry's clothes

1389
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:44,693
可以让猎狗以此来追踪他
and to set the hound on him.
