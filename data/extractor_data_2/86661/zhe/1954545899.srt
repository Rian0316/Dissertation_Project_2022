噢...天哪
Oh, my dear.

6
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,190
最亲爱的
My dearest.

7
00:01:55,304 --> 00:01:57,879
我警告过你 我说过
I warned you, I said,

8
00:01:57,986 --> 00:02:00,229
千万不要走近悬崖
do not go to near the edge.

9
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,029
你为什么推我 Baron?
Why did you push me Baron?

10
00:02:07,632 --> 00:02:11,183
我亲爱的太太 你是在做梦呢
Dear wife, you're dreaming.

11
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:16,856
不 你撒谎...撒谎
No.You're lying.

12
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:21,760
噢 我亲爱的
Oh, my darling.

有什么激动人心的事吗 福尔摩斯?
Anything stirring Holmes?

15
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,151
我了解的就这么多
I know no more than this.

16
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,298
也许是一个自大的傻胖子
There may be some fatty self-important fool,

17
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:25,843
也许是一件生死攸关的事情
it may be a matter of life or death.

18
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,718
嗯 你同意会面了?
Mmm, you grant this interview?

19
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:30,556
我已经确认过了
I've already confirmed it.

20
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:31,951
对于这个人你有什么了解吗?
Do you know anything of the man?

21
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,421
只知道陆军上校James Damery爵士
Only that the name Colonel Sir James Damery

22
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:36,057
是一个家喻户晓的名字
is a household word in society.

23
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:38,243
我可以告诉你更多
I can tell you a little bit more than that.

24
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:40,059
他擅长处理棘手而微妙的事情
He has rather the reputation

25
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:41,648
因而名声在外
for arranging delicate matters,

26
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,853
这些事情是不为媒体所知
which are to be kept out of the papers.

27
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,112
他举世闻名 在外交方面天赋过人
He's a man of the world with a natural turn for diplomacy.

28
00:03:47,354 --> 00:03:49,754
所以我们可以认为
And then, therefore to hope

29
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:52,074
这不是一个错误的警报
it is not a false scent,

30
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:55,983
他应该真的需要我们的帮助
that he has some real need of our assistance.

31
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,878
我们?
Our?

32
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:01,481
嗯 华生 要是你能好心帮帮忙的话
If you'll be so good Watson.

33
00:04:01,518 --> 00:04:03,419
我很荣幸
I shall be honored.

34
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:06,740
那么在四点半以前
Then until four-thirty o'clock

35
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,395
我们可以暂时把这事抛在脑后了
we can put the matter out of our heads.

36
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:15,600
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

37
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,321
这次我们要对付的是欧洲最危险的人
we are dealing on this occasion with the most dangerous man in Europe.

38
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:21,804
我曾经有几个对手
I've had several opponents 

39
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,804
也可以被冠之以这样的称呼
to whom that flattering term has been applied.

40
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,566
他是一个暴徒
A man to whom violence is familiar

41
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:29,203
杀人不眨眼
and who will literally stick at nothing.

42
00:04:30,164 --> 00:04:30,974
您不抽烟吗?
Do you smoke?

43
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:32,328
请原谅我抽烟
Excuse my pipe.

44
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:34,314
要是您说的这个人
But if your man is more dangerous

45
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:35,810
比已故的Moriarty教授还要危险
than the late Professor Moriarty,

46
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:36,958
那他就真值得会上一会了
he's indeed worth meeting.

47
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:38,202
他叫什么呢?
May I ask his name?

48
00:04:38,239 --> 00:04:40,834
您听说过Baron Gruner吗?
Have you ever heard of Baron Gruner?

49
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,227
那个奥地利的杀人犯?
The Austrian murderer?

50
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:47,042
那么您已经把他列为杀人犯了?
So you've already sized him up as a murderer?

51
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,057
我们的业务就是关注欧洲大陆各种罪案
It is our business to follow the details of Continental crime.

52
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:53,235
在Splugen隘道那起所谓的事故中
I'm sure that he killed his wife

53
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:54,883
正是他杀了他的妻子
when that so called accident happened

54
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,377
对此我毫不怀疑 就像亲眼所见一般
at the Splugen Pass as if I'd seen him do it.

55
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,961
我还肯定
Just as I am certain

56
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:01,230
是他除掉了唯一的目击证人
that he disposed the only witness,

57
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,330
那个无辜的牧童
that innocent shepherd boy.

58
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:05,991
Baron Gruner现在在英国
Baron Gruner is now in England.

59
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,921
他听说他就住在Kingston附近?
Residing near Kingston I'm informed?

60
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,466
没错
That is so.

61
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,076
我想您应该
Might I also suppose

62
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:14,652
也听说过Merville将军的名字吧?
you will have heard of General Merville?

63
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,387
他以前是个风云人物
Khyber Pass fame.

64
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:19,608
是的
Indeed,

65
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:23,273
Merville将军有个女儿叫Violet
General Merville has a daughter, Violet.

66
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,154
年轻 富有 多才多艺
Young, rich, accomplished,

67
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,289
不管从哪方面看 都是个非凡的女孩儿
a wonder woman in every way.

68
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,569
她是个单纯的孩子
It is she an innocent

69
00:05:30,606 --> 00:05:34,505
我们要努力把她从那个魔鬼手里救出来
we are endeavoring to save from the clutches of this fiend.

70
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,144
他控制着她吗?
He has some hold over her?

71
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,507
福尔摩斯先生 对女人最有力的控制就是...
The strongest of all where women are concerned, Mr. Holmes.

72
00:05:39,544 --> 00:05:42,705
哈 爱情
Ah, love.

73
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,097
对极了
Exactly.

74
00:05:47,418 --> 00:05:49,282
亲爱的 要是我娶了你
In marrying you, my darling,

75
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:52,672
我过去的罪恶就可以得到宽恕了
all my past sins shall be absolved.

76
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,917
你告诉我的那些并不是什么罪恶
These aren't sins you've told me of.

77
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:56,990
那些都是诽谤
These are slanders.

78
00:05:57,447 --> 00:05:58,394
我的天使
My angel.

79
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:02,175
跟所有伟人一样 你当时被诱入歧途了
You were seduced, as are all great men.

80
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,856
然而我还是决定让你知道我的过去
Yet I am determined you shall know my history,

81
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:06,099
详详细细地
every part of it.

82
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,019
那样的话 当我步上圣坛
Thus shall I come to the altar

83
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,447
心境澄明
purified in soul and spirit

84
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:13,862
最终我才对得起你的爱 对吧?
and worthy at last of your love?

85
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,974
不过是六个星期
Just six weeks,

86
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:18,493
噢 Adelbert
Oh Adelbert.

87
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,470
我不能假装过去清白无暇
I cannot pretend my past is without stain.

88
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:28,826
没有一个出身贫困
No man born in poverty

89
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,887
而又白手起家的人可以那样说
who has created his own fortune

90
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,991
说实话吧 不是的
can say that and speak the truth, oh, no.

91
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,988
我曾经被迫做出不少无情的事情 亲爱的
I have been forced to many a ruthless act, my dear.

92
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,311
我该从哪儿说起呢?
Where shall I begin?

93
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,600
福尔摩斯先生 看到有人
To observe, Mr. Holmes, an atrocious event,

94
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,654
就在您眼前谋划着一起残忍的罪行
preparing itself before your very eyes

95
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,542
却无力改变它
and yet be powerless to avert it.

96
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,430
还有任何人面对过
Could anyone, any human being

97
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,721
比这更难受的事情吗?
be placed in a more trying position?

98
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:55,934
也许没有
Perhaps not.

99
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:59,764
那么您应该能够同情 我当事人的处境
Well then you will sympathize with the client in whose interest I am acting.

100
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:03,212
我不明白
I did not understand

101
00:07:03,249 --> 00:07:05,499
您居然只是中间人
that you were merely an intermediary,

102
00:07:05,536 --> 00:07:07,577
那谁是委托人呢?
who is the principal?

103
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:11,023
我恳求您不要问这个问题
I beg of you not to press that question.

104
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,180
他的名字不能被牵扯进来
His name cannot be dragged into this matter.

105
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,891
他的动机是非常高尚的
His motives are to the last degree honorable

106
00:07:16,928 --> 00:07:19,395
但是他不想让别人知道
but he prefers to remain unknown.

107
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:23,547
而您的费用是不成问题 我可以保证 福尔摩斯先生
I need not say that your fees will be assured, Mr. Holmes.

108
00:07:27,553 --> 00:07:29,721
而且您不会受到任何约束
And you will be allowed a free hand.

109
00:07:32,254 --> 00:07:35,688
委托人的名字又有何相关呢?
Surely the actual name of your client is immaterial.

110
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,271
我只能拒绝您的要求了 James爵士 我很抱歉
I must decline to act, Sir James, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,016
我习惯了案件本身的迷雾重重
I'm accustomed to having mystery at one end of my cases

112
00:07:41,053 --> 00:07:43,599
但连您这边也是 未免太让人困惑了
but to have it at both ends is too confusing.

113
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:44,700
不行
No.

114
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,763
您让我太为难了
You place me in the most serious dilemma.

115
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,946
福尔摩斯先生
Dare I say, Mr. Holmes,

116
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:54,988
我得说您没有意识到您这样做的后果
you hardly realize the affect of your own action.

117
00:07:55,544 --> 00:07:56,653
我保证过
I have given my word

118
00:07:56,654 --> 00:07:59,869
不泄露我当事人的名字
 not to reveal the identity of my client.

119
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:04,259
能否允许我至少把可以讲的事 先告诉您?
May I at the least lay all I can before you?

120
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,120
您必须明白
It is understood.

121
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,411
我没有做出任何承诺
I commit myself to nothing.

122
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:22,139
那是当然 我明白
But of course, yes, yes.

123
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,498
画得太像了
A perfect likeness.

124
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:29,055
是谁画的?
Who painted it?

125
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:30,568
Innsbruck的Hans
Hans of Innsbruck,

126
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:33,972
他是雕刻家Claus的后代 以雕刻铜像而著称
a descendant of Claus the sculptor famous for his bronzes

127
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,499
就像这尊
such as this.

128
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:42,122
我将委托Hans来为你 画一幅肖像 我亲爱的
I shall commission Hans to attempt your likeness, my precious.

129
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,737
我爱这个房间
I love this room.

130
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:48,092
到处都有你的气息
It breathes of you.

131
00:08:55,304 --> 00:08:57,123
这是什么呀?
What's this?

132
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,069
你的日记吗?
Your diary?

133
00:09:00,658 --> 00:09:02,390
不 不 它是...
No, no, it is,

134
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,495
是我的日常记事本
it is my commonplace book.

135
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,173
里面记录着我看过的
In it I record things I've seen,

136
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,377
读过的和欣赏的东西
read, admired,

137
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,535
也许有时还有
occasionally perhaps

138
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:13,940
我的一点儿想法
a thought or two of my own.

139
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,517
但是它上了锁
But it's locked.

140
00:09:16,907 --> 00:09:18,692
它代表我的一部分
It is a little part of me,

141
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:22,960
何况 我怕仆人会偷窥
besides a servant might pry.

142
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:25,414
有一天 也许...
One day, perhaps,

143
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,654
我们可以一起读一读
we shall look at it together.

144
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:33,480
不 我尊重你的隐私 亲爱的
No, I respect your privacy, my darling.

145
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:36,034
无论我们分享多少
We must all keep something of our own,

146
00:09:36,758 --> 00:09:39,156
总该有一些自己保留的东西
however much else we share.

147
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:45,551
你真是太完美了
You are perfect.

148
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,349
你应该教我一些瓷器的知识 Adelbert
You must teach me about porcelain, Adelbert.

149
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:51,593
好的
I shall.

150
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,912
收藏是一大乐事
Collecting is such a pleasure,

151
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:55,498
赏心悦目
such a delight,

152
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:56,885
总能让我充满激情
it is a passion with me

153
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:59,594
就像你一样 我亲爱的
just as you are, my precious.

154
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,558
这个恶棍黏上了这位女士
The villain has attached himself to a lady

155
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:03,300
而且是彻彻底底
with such effect that he has completely 

156
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:07,144
赢得了她的芳心
and absolutely won her heart.

157
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,781
对他不利的话她一句也不想听
She will not hear one word against him.

158
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,162
总而言之 她打算下个月就要嫁给他
To sum up, she proposes to marry him next month.

159
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,650
她已经成年了而且意志坚决
As she of age and has a will of iron

160
00:10:15,687 --> 00:10:18,396
真不知道如何阻止她
that's hard to know how to prevent her.

161
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,566
这个被爱冲昏头脑的女士
Does the infatuated young woman

162
00:10:21,603 --> 00:10:23,190
知道发生在瑞士的那件事情吗?
know of the Swiss episode?

163
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:23,981
这个狡诈的恶魔
The cunning devil

164
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,890
把他过去所有令人厌恶的丑事都告诉了她
 has told her every unsavory scandal of his past life

165
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,566
可是总把自己说成是
but always in such a way

166
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:31,721
无辜的受害者
as to make himself out to be the innocent martyr.

167
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,667
她完全听信于他
She accepts his version

168
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:34,819
别人的话也不听
and will listen to no one,

169
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:36,796
连长辈们的话也听不进去
not even her fathers.

170
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,046
天哪 James爵士
Dear me, Sir James,

171
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:41,924
您是不是不小心泄露了 你的委托人的名字?
have you not inadvertently let out the name of your client?

172
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:42,951
将军吗?
The General?

173
00:10:42,988 --> 00:10:44,487
噢 不 华生医生
Oh no, Dr. Watson,

174
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:48,866
那位坚强的军人受此打击 已经一蹶不振了
that strong soldier has been utterly demoralized by this incident.

175
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,312
MHudson太太
Mrs. Hudson.

176
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:57,458
您摁铃了吗 先生?
You rang, sir?

177
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,803
能不能麻烦你把这个 送到街角屠夫家的男孩那儿?
Will you deliver this to the butcher's boy around the corner?

178
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:02,205
那个一只眼睛长得很可笑的小坏蛋吗?
That young rascal with the funny eye?

179
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,410
另一只眼睛却是无价之宝啊 还有他的自行车
The other is invaluable, so is his bicycle.

180
00:11:05,895 --> 00:11:07,322
好的 先生
Sir.

181
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:17,216
我该怎么联系您呢 James爵士?
How may I keep in touch with you, Sir James?

182
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,442
您接受我的委托了吗?
You accept my commission?

183
00:11:18,548 --> 00:11:22,646
不妨说是您的问题引起了我的兴趣
Let us just say that your problem interests me.

184
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:24,499
通过Carlton俱乐部可以找到我
The Carlton Club will find me.

185
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,972
Baron在Kingston的具体地址是什么?
And the Baron's exact address in Kingston?

186
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:28,074
Vernon宅邸
Vernon Lodge,

187
00:11:28,112 --> 00:11:29,544
一座大宅
the large house,

188
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,870
他是个有钱人
he's a rich man.

189
00:11:30,908 --> 00:11:34,645
啊哈 投机者在成功的时候都是有钱人 James爵士
Uh-huh, speculators when successful frequently are, Sir James,

190
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:35,880
您还能提供
what further information

191
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,389
更多有关这个人的信息吗?
can you give us about the man?

192
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,019
他的嗜好所费不菲
He has expensive tastes.

193
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:40,588
收藏书籍 绘画
Collects books, pictures,

194
00:11:40,624 --> 00:11:42,331
噢 还有中国瓷器
oh, and Chinese pottery.

195
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,285
他是这方面公认的权威
He's a recognized authority,

196
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:46,622
写过一本相关的书
written a book upon the subject.

197
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:48,358
James爵士 您可以告诉您的委托人
Well, Sir James, you may tell your client

198
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:51,004
我会开始注意Baron Gruner的
that I'm turning my attention towards Baron Gruner.

199
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:53,082
福尔摩斯先生 我毫不怀疑
I have no doubt, Mr. Holmes,

200
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:55,547
您不费吹灰之力就可以 追查出我的委托人的身份
you can easily trace my client.

201
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,593
但我必须请求您以名誉担保
But I must ask you as a point of honor

202
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,997
请您不要这样做
to refrain from doing so.

203
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:04,320
不要去挖出他的名字
Do not, I beg you, break in upon his incognito.

204
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:05,967
我想这点我可以保证
I think I can safely promise that.

205
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:07,411
谢谢
Thank you.

206
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:09,514
再见 医生
Dr. Watson.

207
00:12:29,972 --> 00:12:32,092
你这是在浪费时间 华生
You're wasting your time, Watson.

208
00:12:32,096 --> 00:12:33,542
Merville将军的生涯
Now the career of General Merville

209
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,688
也许正好帮我们查出我们委托人的身份
might well give us a pointer as to our client.

210
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:36,889
他是如此杰出
He's clearly illustrious.

211
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:38,141
但是您没有听到James爵士说的话吗?
But did you not hear, Sir James?

212
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:40,581
他要求的是你 福尔摩斯
His request was to you, Holmes.

213
00:12:40,618 --> 00:12:42,517
这样做不光彩 华生 不光彩
But that is shameful, Watson, shameful

214
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:48,108
再说我们的脑子要用在更有价值的地方 打消这念头吧
besides our minds should be  more gainfully employed, desist.

215
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:54,318
对这件事你有什么看法吗?
Any views?

216
00:12:54,355 --> 00:12:55,448
你没有吗?
Have you none?

217
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:56,850
还没有
Not yet.

218
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,430
只有一个想法 我已经着手行事了
Beyond the one I've already acted upon.

219
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,877
屠夫家的男孩
The butcher's boy.

220
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:04,042
这样做比发电报谨慎
More discreet than any telegraph.

221
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:10,028
嗯 我倒是觉得 你最好亲自去见见这位年轻女士
Well, I shall think you better see the young lady yourself.

222
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,672
从她入手
Start with her.

223
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:13,848
呃 要是那可怜的崩溃了的父亲 都不能说服她
Well, if her poor broken down father cannot move her,

224
00:13:13,885 --> 00:13:15,986
我这样一个陌生人又怎能成功呢?
how can I, a complete stranger prevail?

225
00:13:16,023 --> 00:13:17,603
呃 要是所有做法都不行
Well, if all else fails,

226
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:20,024
也许我会去的
Perhaps.

227
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:24,407
但是首先要利用下层社会
But first, the underworld.

228
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,700
因为他们能接触到犯罪的邪恶本质
For it is among the dark roots of crime

229
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:29,247
我们必须搜寻Gruner的秘密
that we must hunt for Gruner's secrets.

230
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,923
你已经派人去找Shinwell Johnson了 (福尔摩斯在伦敦黑社会里的一个耳目)
You've sent for Shinwell Johnson.

231
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:37,850
我有一个想法
I have but one insight,

232
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,156
Merville小姐也许能够宽恕谋杀
that Ms. Merville might well condone murder

233
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:48,000
但不会原谅某些更小的风流韵事
yet some smaller affair that might (unintelligible)

234
00:13:50,305 --> 00:13:51,696
我们走着瞧吧
We shall see.

235
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,102
他们请到了最好的侦探
They have engaged the very best.

236
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,539
让他进来
Show him in.

237
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:10,089
这位是歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生  先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, sir.

238
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:24,126
我早知道我们迟早会见面 福尔摩斯先生
I rather thought I should see you sooner or later, Mr. Holmes.

239
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,079
你肯定是受到了Merville将军的委托吧
You've been retained no doubt by General Merville

240
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:36,970
来阻止我和他女儿Violet的婚事
to prevent my marriage with his daughter, Violet?

241
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,827
是这样的吧?
That is so, is it not?

242
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,671
福尔摩斯先生 我竭力劝告您
Let me advise you very strongly, Mr. Holmes,

243
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,275
就此罢手
to draw off at once.

244
00:14:51,312 --> 00:14:52,970
罢手?
Draw off?

245
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,450
亲爱的朋友
My dear man,

246
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,749
那不仅会毁掉你的好名声
you'll only ruin your well-deserved reputation.

247
00:14:56,786 --> 00:15:00,280
在这件事情上 你是没有希望成功的 罢手吧 先生
This is not a case in which you  can possibly hope to succeed, draw off sir.

248
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,387
听上去有些奇怪 不过这也正是我要给你的忠告
It is curious but that is the very advice that I've come to give you.

249
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:07,220
我坦率地说了吧
Let me put it to you man to man.

250
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:08,978
如果你坚持要缔结这桩婚事
If you persist in this marriage,

251
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:12,257
你将会树起无数劲敌
you will raise such a swarm of powerful enemies,

252
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:14,296
到时连在英国的立足之地都没有
England would be too hot to hold you.

253
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:19,037
你就此罢手将会是更明智的做法
Surely you will be wiser to draw off.

254
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,090
原谅我的忍俊不禁 福尔摩斯先生
Excuse my amusement, Mr. Holmes,

255
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:27,534
手上没有牌
but it really is very funny

256
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:30,941
却想赌上一把 这实在太滑稽了
seeing you trying to play a hand with no cards in it.

257
00:15:30,978 --> 00:15:32,660
连一张大牌都没有 先生
Not a color card there, sir,

258
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,305
除了小之又小的牌 你什么也没有
nothing but the smallest of the small.

259
00:15:34,342 --> 00:15:35,066
你自以为
So you think.

260
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,909
不是'认为' 先生 是'知道'
So I know, sir, so I know.

261
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,470
让我明白地告诉你
Let me make the thing clear to you.

262
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:40,324
你觉得自己胜券在握
You consider your hand so strong

263
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,309
让我看见了也无妨吗?
that you could afford to show it?

264
00:15:42,347 --> 00:15:44,764
当然了 因为事情是明摆着的
Certainly, since it becomes plain that in this instance

265
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,113
在这件事上你完全无能为力 福尔摩斯先生
you are clearly out of your depth, Mr. Holmes.

266
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,863
有没有可能你的能力被夸大了呢?
Could it be that your capabilities have been subject to hyperbole?

267
00:15:53,345 --> 00:15:55,540
你的一手牌呢 给我看吧
Your hand, show it.

268
00:15:56,105 --> 00:15:57,890
你不坐下来吗?
Won't you sit down?

269
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,287
我想还是不要了
I think I shan't.

270
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,015
那就随你的便
Please yourself.

271
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:09,691
呃 先生
Well, sir,

272
00:16:11,313 --> 00:16:14,615
我碰巧就是很走运
it happens I have been fortunate enough

273
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:18,626
赢得了Merville小姐全心的爱
to win the entire affection of Ms. Merville.

274
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:19,832
尽管我曾经清楚地对她讲过
This in spite of the fact

275
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:22,311
过去发生在我身上的
that I have informed her clearly

276
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:27,916
所有那些不令人愉快的事件
of all the unhappy incidents in my past.

277
00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:32,831
我还警告她说 某些耍阴谋的人会去找她
I have warned her that certain  designing persons would come to her.

278
00:16:33,322 --> 00:16:35,921
我希望你认清这一点
I hope you recognize yourself in this

279
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:38,426
并把这些事情告诉她
and would tell her of these things.

280
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,049
我已经教过她如何来对付这些事情
I have instructed her how to treat them.

281
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,555
她对你的拜访已经做好准备了
She is well prepared for you.

282
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:53,015
她肯定会答应见你
She will no doubt give you an appointment

283
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,611
而且听完你的陈述
and she will listen.

284
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,976
但你的所作所为都是徒劳
It will be to no avail, however.

285
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,482
要是你想说些什么
If you wish to speak,

286
00:17:03,518 --> 00:17:05,713
现在正是时候
now is your moment.

287
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,836
不
No,

288
00:17:10,027 --> 00:17:11,691
还不到时候
this is not the moment.

289
00:17:14,762 --> 00:17:17,334
顺便说一句 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, by the way, Mr. Holmes,

290
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,991
你认识法国侦探Labrun吗?
did you know the French Agent Labrun?

291
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:22,893
当然认识
Of course.

292
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:25,210
那你也知道他出了什么事情吧?
So you know what befell him?

293
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,239
他在巴黎的Lamont区遭到了毒打
He was beaten in the Lamont District of Paris

294
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,078
落下了终生残废
and crippled for life.

295
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:30,841
没错
Quite so.

296
00:17:30,878 --> 00:17:32,389
奇怪的巧合是
By an odd coincidence

297
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,645
他之前同样在调查我
he had been inquiring into my affairs.

298
00:17:34,682 --> 00:17:38,842
还是别那样做的好 福尔摩斯先生 那样做不吉利
Don't do it, Mr. Holmes, it's not a lucky thing.

299
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:40,400
我的最后忠告是...
My last word to you is

300
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:44,562
你走你的阳关道 我走我的独木桥吧
 you go your way,let me go mine.

301
00:17:46,248 --> 00:17:47,970
好自为之吧 Gruner
Mind you Gruner,

302
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:51,185
如果你指望为英国社交界所接受
because if you aspire to be accepted into English Society

303
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,613
你就要学会在点雪茄之前
you'll do well to remove the band

304
00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:54,365
先把外头的标签去掉
from your Havana before lighting it

305
00:17:54,403 --> 00:17:57,784
否则人家会把你当成一个暴发户而瞧不起你
otherwise you'll be put down for a bounder.

306
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:13,381
Hudson太太 福尔摩斯回来了吗?
Mrs. Hudson, has Holmes returned?

307
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:16,492
还没呢 先生 不过有两个客人在等着
Not yet, sir, but there are two visitors waiting.

308
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,596
谢谢 Hudson太太
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

309
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,091
啊 Johnson
Why Johnson.

310
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,101
晚上好 医生
Evening, Doctor,

311
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,554
福尔摩斯先生给我捎话了
Mr. Holmes sent word to me.

312
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,488
我知道 Johnson 我知道
I know, Johnson, I know.

313
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,073
我还把Kit带来了 因为...
And I brought Kit here because...

314
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,552
我在博物馆耽搁了一会儿
That's when I was delayed at the museum

315
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,713
然后又是交通
and then the traffic,

316
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,719
有辆马车在Great Russell街翻车了
an omnibus overturned on Great Russell Street,

317
00:18:37,756 --> 00:18:40,057
他们得拖走两匹死马
two dead a horse had to be put down.

318
00:18:40,094 --> 00:18:41,100
请原谅 先生们
Gentlemen forgive me,

319
00:18:41,136 --> 00:18:43,185
我沉浸在自己的谜题中
I was absorbed by the mysteries of me,

320
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,711
而忘记了时间 女士
I quite forgotten the hour, madam.

321
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,012
这是Winter小姐 福尔摩斯先生
This is Ms. Winter, Mr. Holmes,

322
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,114
我们叫她Kitty
Kitty we call her

323
00:18:49,151 --> 00:18:50,453
对于Gruner她没有什么不知道的
and what she don't know about Gruner.

324
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,038
当然了 请讲吧
Of course, please.

325
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:53,609
呃 Kitty自己可以讲
Well, Kitty can speak for herself.

326
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,611
不管怎么说 一接到您的口信
Anyway I put me hand right on her

327
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,991
一个钟头之内我就找到她了 先生
within an hour of your message, sir.

328
00:18:57,027 --> 00:18:58,535
很容易就能找到我
I'm easy to find.

329
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,213
该死的 伦敦次次都让我犯迷糊
Hell, London gets me every time,

330
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,873
小胖也是
same address goes for Porky.

331
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,187
小胖? 那是你的外号吗 Johnson?
Porky, is that your nom-de-guerre Johnson?

332
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,098
你可从没说起过
You have never revealed that.

333
00:19:08,135 --> 00:19:10,652
小胖 哈哈哈
Porky, well.

334
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,566
小胖和我是老相识了
We're old mates, Porky and me.

335
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:16,747
但是还有一个人 该下到比我们更深的地狱去
But there's someone who ought to be down in a lower hell than us

336
00:19:16,784 --> 00:19:18,891
那个人就是你在调查的人  福尔摩斯先生
and that's the man you're after, Mr. Holmes.

337
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,746
我想我们能得到你帮助的吧 Winter小姐?
I gather we have your good wishes, Ms. Winter?

338
00:19:20,782 --> 00:19:22,564
要是我能帮上忙让他露出原形
If I can help put him where he belongs,

339
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:25,591
我任您差遣 先生
I'm yours to the rattle, sir.

340
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:26,735
你知道他的企图
Do you know what he intends,

341
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:28,895
和目前的情况吗?
how the matter stands?

342
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,968
小胖说他又追上了某个可怜的傻瓜
Porky tells me he's after some other poor fool

343
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,851
只不过这次他想娶她
only this time he wants to marry her

344
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:35,848
而您想阻止他?
and you want to stop it?

345
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,225
是的
Yes.

346
00:19:37,262 --> 00:19:39,513
您对这个恶棍肯定有足够的了解
Surely you know enough about this devil

347
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,250
去阻止任何头脑清醒的正派女子
to prevent any decent girl in her senses

348
00:19:41,286 --> 00:19:42,935
陷入与他的纠葛之中
wanting to have anything to do with him.

349
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:45,582
可是她现在脑子并不清醒 Winter小姐
But she's not in her senses, Ms. Winter,

350
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,678
她狂热地爱着他
she's madly in love

351
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:49,325
而且她也听说过他的那些事了
and she has been told all about it.

352
00:19:49,361 --> 00:19:50,225
可是她不在乎
She cares for nothing.

353
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:52,552
她也知道他杀过自己的妻子吗?
Told about the murder of his wife?

354
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:53,939
是的
Yes.

355
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:57,535
天哪 她肯定有很坚强的神经
My lord, she must have a nerve.

356
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,217
确实如此
She has.

357
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,463
您就不能把证据给她看吗?
Can't you lay proofs before her?

358
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,558
你能否帮我们这样做?
Can you help us do so?

359
00:20:03,595 --> 00:20:04,836
我就是一个证据
I am proof,

360
00:20:05,544 --> 00:20:07,236
活生生的证据
living proof.

361
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,380
要是我能站在她面前
If I was to stand before her

362
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,549
告诉她我是如何被他利用的就好了
and tell her how he used me.

363
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:16,144
你愿意吗?
Would you do this?

364
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,547
愿意
Would I,

365
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:20,366
难道会不愿意吗?
would I not.

366
00:20:20,403 --> 00:20:22,119
也许值得一试
It might be worth the trying.

367
00:20:22,157 --> 00:20:25,350
噢 不 他没有把全部都告诉她 先生
Oh no he didn't tell her all, sir.

368
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:28,983
全部?
All?

369
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:32,364
他收藏了我
He collected me,

370
00:20:33,252 --> 00:20:35,368
他收藏女人
he collects women.

371
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:38,524
我是一个绘画模特
I was an artist's model,

372
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,394
一个受人尊敬的绘画模特
a respectable artist's model.

373
00:20:40,431 --> 00:20:42,573
当然了 他书房里的那副肖像 就是以你为模特的
Of course, you sat for that painting in his study.

374
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:45,494
你去过Kingston了
You've been to Kingston,

375
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:48,010
那你也看过他的坛坛罐罐了
then you'll have seen all his crocks.

376
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,330
女人和瓷器
Women and china,

377
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:52,500
他酷爱的两样东西
they're his twin passions.

378
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,995
Gruner请别人画了这幅画
Gruner commissioned that painting

379
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:56,900
而之后
and afterwards,

380
00:20:58,235 --> 00:20:59,954
之后...
and after...

381
00:21:04,188 --> 00:21:08,126
呃 我们就这么说吧-- 在那之后我就再也无法工作了
well, let's just say I can never work again.

382
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,248
再也工作不了
Never.

383
00:21:12,553 --> 00:21:13,979
再也...
Never.

384
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:21,719
我对你十分感谢 Winter小姐
I am exceedingly obliged to you, Ms. Winter,

385
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,289
我们会让你
we shall indeed interview you

386
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,876
跟Merville小姐见面的
and Ms. Merville together.

387
00:21:26,914 --> 00:21:29,939
我的委托人会对你做出大方的补偿的
My client will compensate you most liberally.

388
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,225
噢 福尔摩斯先生 用不着的
Oh, none of that, Mr. Holmes.

389
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,528
我又不缺钱
I'm not out for money.

390
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,275
我就想看着这个人跌进泥潭
Just let me see this man in the mud,

391
00:21:36,525 --> 00:21:39,130
让我给他的脸狠狠地踩上一脚
in the mud with my foot in his face

392
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,175
我就满足了
that's my price.

393
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:55,628
谢谢
Thank you.

394
00:22:11,505 --> 00:22:12,658
来自Kingston的
From Kingston.

395
00:22:12,694 --> 00:22:15,711
谢谢 Hudson太太 我不回复了
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, no reply.

396
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:17,039
我们去吃饭吗?
Shall we dine?

397
00:22:21,646 --> 00:22:23,782
可这是一封死亡威胁啊 福尔摩斯
This is a death threat, Holmes.

398
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:27,388
你还能指望Baron Gruner给我发来 什么更友善的东西吗?
Did you expect anything less from Baron Gruner.

399
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:28,687
福尔摩斯 还是小心为好
Holmes, have a care.

400
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,933
噢 华生 走吧
Oh, Watson, come along.

401
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,911
我们得吃东西了
We must eat.

402
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:57,587
快跑
Come on girl.

403
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:43,403
他们没有跟上来
They ain't following no more.

404
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,259
千万别这么想
Don't you believe it.

405
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:51,849
我说得没错吧
What'd I say.

406
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:54,610
你站到一边去 Kitty
Now you stand over there, Kitty,

407
00:23:54,648 --> 00:23:56,192
这样才是个好女孩
there's a good girl.

408
00:23:56,229 --> 00:24:01,360
好吧 谁先上 你吗? 还是你?
Right, who's first, you or you?

409
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,049
业余选手
Amateurs,

410
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:42,179
都是些生手
they've done no time,

411
00:24:42,216 --> 00:24:44,674
什么也不懂 我们走吧
don't know nothing, come on girl.

412
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:53,532
有两个人想见您 先生
There's two persons wish to see you sir.

413
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:54,938
什么人?
Persons?

414
00:26:54,975 --> 00:26:58,869
坦白地说 恐怕不能算是什么绅士
I couldn't in honesty term them gentlemen, sir.

415
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,159
我就来
I'll come.

416
00:27:19,362 --> 00:27:21,348
他带着武器吗?
Was he armed?

417
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:23,410
没有 先生
No, sir.

418
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,925
到厨房里去
Go through to the kitchens,

419
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,062
把自己好好洗干净
clean yourselves up

420
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,253
然后走吧
and clear out.

421
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:56,442
我是出于对我父亲的尊敬
I have agreed to this visit

422
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,384
才同意与你会面的 福尔摩斯先生
out of respect for my father, Mr. Holmes,

423
00:27:58,421 --> 00:27:59,746
这样做可不是为了你
rather than for you.

424
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:01,643
我的未婚夫对我说
My fianc?assures me

425
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,138
你已经不是原来的你了
you are no longer what you were,

426
00:28:04,107 --> 00:28:05,634
有钱能使鬼推磨啊
a spent force.

427
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:07,981
而Winter小姐你...
And you, Ms. Winter,

428
00:28:08,706 --> 00:28:12,337
你的出现应该是毫无必要的
surely you must also be superfluous.

429
00:28:12,375 --> 00:28:15,851
我们完全是出于好意
Our intentions are the best.

430
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:17,968
我们是来帮你的
We are here to aid you.

431
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,212
是嘛?
Really?

432
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:22,552
你们到这儿来诽谤我的未婚夫 也算是好意吗?
When you call to malign my fianc?

433
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:27,100
Merville小姐 我不是以富有爱心而出名的
I am not renowned, Ms. Merville,  for the warmth of my affections

434
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,546
但我却能欣赏别人的爱心
but I can appreciate them in others.

435
00:28:29,992 --> 00:28:31,766
如果我有个女儿
Had I a daughter,

436
00:28:31,803 --> 00:28:35,540
我会为她着想的 就像将军为你那样
I should, I hope feel for you as the General does,

437
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:38,236
我们的关切也不是没有根据的
nor is our concern without foundation.

438
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:41,509
看来你已经开始在恶意中伤了
There, the slander begins.

439
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:42,976
非也 我并非那种会轻易上门拜访...
No, I do not readily call upon anyone

440
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:44,647
...并且去恳求别人的人
to beg or to plead

441
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:47,913
但事关Baron Gruner 请你认真听我说 我从来都不会毫无根据地乱说话
but in Baron Gruner, please, I never speak idly.

442
00:28:47,949 --> 00:28:52,885
你选择了他 既不明智又很危险
You've chosen not only unwisely but dangerously.

443
00:28:52,923 --> 00:28:56,810
Merville小姐
Marry him, Ms. Merville, and I assure you

444
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,271
根据我对犯罪心理的了解
with all the knowledge I have

445
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:00,012
如果你嫁给他
of the criminal mentality,

446
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,551
我敢说你将面临极大的危险
you will be in mortal danger.

447
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:06,210
会落得前男爵夫人那样的下场
Just as the former baroness was,

448
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:08,988
她也是太为他着迷
she too was infatuated,

449
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,733
以致付出了死亡的代价
and paid the fatal price,

450
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,112
用她的性命为他换来了一大笔财产
her life for a fortune.

451
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:16,485
满口谎言
That's a lie.

452
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:20,242
你应该注意到
You are of course aware

453
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,012
Splugen隘道
that the Splugen Pass

454
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:23,757
是连接意大利和瑞士的吧?
where your predecessor died

455
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:27,490
那就是他的前一任夫人死去的地方
runs between Italy and Switzerland?

456
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:29,699
这跟地理学又有什么关系?
What does the geography matter?

457
00:29:29,736 --> 00:29:31,952
如果你打算把一个无助的女人
A great deal,

458
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:33,845
从一个国家境内的悬崖推下去
when you plan to hurl a helpless woman

459
00:29:33,883 --> 00:29:34,885
而正好让她在另一个国家摔断脖子
off a cliff in one country

460
00:29:34,922 --> 00:29:36,662
那地理学的关系可就大得很了
to break her neck in another.

461
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,749
但那只是一起意外
But it was an accident.

462
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:40,802
那为什么
Then why did the shepherd boy

463
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:42,438
那个目睹男爵夫人坠崖的牧童
who saw the baroness fall

464
00:29:42,475 --> 00:29:45,092
会死于砒霜中毒呢?
die of arsenical poison?

465
00:29:45,878 --> 00:29:49,086
谋杀他的女人便是受了Gruner的诱骗
His murderess whom Gruner had seduced

466
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:50,689
她在审讯时供认
confessed at her trial

467
00:29:50,726 --> 00:29:53,719
是他威胁她去投毒的
that he'd obliged her to administer the fatal substance

468
00:29:53,756 --> 00:29:55,674
不然的话
or risk disfigurement for life

469
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:58,344
他就会用硫酸将她毁容
by oil of vitriol.

470
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,595
这些都是事实 Merville小姐
Those are the facts, Ms. Merville.

471
00:30:02,632 --> 00:30:04,402
我恳求你
I beg you,

472
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:06,745
想象一下
picture the awful situation

473
00:30:06,782 --> 00:30:08,324
要是你在婚后
you will find yourself in

474
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:12,779
才对你未婚夫的本性有清醒的认识
if you only wake to your fianc?s true character

475
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:15,411
那情形将会是多么可怕
after you have married him.

476
00:30:23,376 --> 00:30:26,615
我一直在很耐心地听你说话 福尔摩斯先生
I have listened to you with patience, Mr. Holmes.

477
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:31,097
我知道我未婚夫过去的生活颇为颠沛
I am aware my fianc? has had a stormy life

478
00:30:31,133 --> 00:30:35,295
招致了许多非常不公平的中伤
in which he has incurred most unjust aspersions.

479
00:30:35,976 --> 00:30:37,793
也许你的用意是好的
Possibly you mean well

480
00:30:38,677 --> 00:30:40,864
尽管我知道你只不过 是人家花钱雇佣的侦探而已
though I learn you are a paid agent

481
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:45,526
但是不管怎么说我爱Baron Gruner
but in any case I love Baron Gruner

482
00:30:45,563 --> 00:30:47,036
而他也爱我
and he loves me.

483
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,930
你已经向我介绍了这位女士的名字
You have told me this young lady's name

484
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:55,243
而且说她的到来是有原因的
and that there is a reason for her presence.

485
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,762
确实是有原因的
I'll say there is.

486
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:58,588
你到底是什么人 Winter小姐?
And what exactly are you, Ms. Winter?

487
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:02,313
我吗? 我来告诉你吧
Me, I'll tell you.

488
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,283
我来告诉你我是什么人
I'll tell you what I am.

489
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,511
我曾经是他的情妇
I was his mistress that's who,

490
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:09,145
是他上百个情妇中的一个
one of a hundred more.

491
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:12,996
他引诱我们 利用我们 毁掉我们 然后就把我们扔在一边
He's tempted, used, ruined and thrown aside,

492
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:13,965
他也会这样对你的
as he will you too.

493
00:31:14,001 --> 00:31:15,127
得了吧
Please.

494
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,628
你要是嫁给他 你就完了
You marry this man it'll be the death of you.

495
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:21,242
你最后从他那里得到的 不是一颗破碎的心就是一个折了的脖子!
It may be a broken heart or a  broken neck but he'll have you.

496
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,308
噢 是嘛
Oh really.

497
00:31:22,344 --> 00:31:24,546
你也许觉得你跟别人不一样 好了 Kitty
-You may think yourself different. -Thank you, Kitty,

498
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,278
你已经说得够清楚的了
you've made yourself admirably clear.

499
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:30,027
我知道 我未婚夫曾有三次
I'm aware of three occasions in my fianc?s life

500
00:31:30,064 --> 00:31:33,391
被颇有心计的女人纠缠不休
when he has become entangled with designing women.

501
00:31:33,428 --> 00:31:36,713
而他真心的悔悟已经使我放下心来
And I'm assured by him of his hearty repentance.

502
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,099
他?
Him?

503
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,418
他会悔悟?
Repent?

504
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:41,178
还说只有三个女人?
And only three?

505
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,511
噢 你这个傻瓜!
Oh, you fool,

506
00:31:43,548 --> 00:31:45,349
你真是个愚蠢的傻瓜!
you stupid fool.

507
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:46,852
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

508
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,404
我遵照我父亲的意愿与你见面
I have obeyed my father's wish in seeing you

509
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:53,486
但我不想被迫 去听这些话带诽谤的疯言疯语...
but I'm not compelled to listen to the slanderous ravings...

510
00:31:53,523 --> 00:31:54,446
疯言疯语?
Ravings?

511
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:57,290
你说我疯言疯语!
Ravings!

512
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,781
哦 天哪
Oh my god,

513
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:04,144
我要让你看个明白
I'll show you.

514
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,579
看啊
Look,

515
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:16,352
看啊
look.

516
00:32:19,072 --> 00:32:20,633
你看见了吗?
You see that?

517
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:26,752
这里 都是硫酸造成的
And here, oil of vitriol.

518
00:32:27,503 --> 00:32:28,867
就是他干的
He did it.

519
00:32:29,551 --> 00:32:32,596
没错 就是他干的
Oh, yes, he did it,

520
00:32:32,633 --> 00:32:34,736
就是你的未婚夫干的好事
your fianc?

521
00:32:34,772 --> 00:32:36,437
你骗人!
That's a lie.

522
00:32:37,214 --> 00:32:39,650
你骗人! 好了  Kitty
-It's a lie. -Thank you, Kitty.

523
00:32:48,402 --> 00:32:50,412
你可以告诉Baron 不把他绳之以法
You can tell the Baron that I shall not rest

524
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,523
我决不罢休
until I bring him to justice.

525
00:33:00,722 --> 00:33:02,086
Winter小姐
Ms. Winter.

526
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,574
为什么呢 Kitty 到底怎么回事?
Why Kitty, why?

527
00:33:18,925 --> 00:33:21,872
不 请别再问了 为什么Gruner会这样对你?
-No please. -Why did Gruner treat you so?

528
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,334
因为...
Because...

529
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:27,824
-不 我说不出口 福尔摩斯先生 -在这节骨眼上你一定要告诉我
-no, I can't tell you, Mr. Holmes. -You must at this instant.

530
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:29,167
你说他收藏女人
You said that he collects women,

531
00:33:29,204 --> 00:33:30,919
是什么意思?
what did you mean by that?

532
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,442
他有一个本子
It's a book he has.

533
00:33:34,834 --> 00:33:35,902
一个本子?
A book?

534
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:39,582
褐色皮面的 还上了锁
Brown leather with a lock

535
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,938
上面还有他的金色盾徽
and his coat of arms in gold on it.

536
00:33:41,974 --> 00:33:44,442
不 我实在不该提起它
No, I can't speak of it.

537
00:33:44,479 --> 00:33:46,679
他对他的女人都做了记录吗?
He keeps a record of his women?

538
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:49,399
我们都在那个本子里
We're all in there.

539
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:53,849
照片 姓名 每人的详细情况
Photographs, names, details,

540
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:56,029
有关我们的一切都在那里头
everything about us.

541
00:33:56,812 --> 00:33:58,924
他要我念它们 在我和他...
He tried to make me read it while he...

542
00:33:58,961 --> 00:34:00,953
不 我实在说不出口
oh, no, I can't.

543
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,264
当你拒绝的时候.....?
And when you refused?

544
00:34:03,089 --> 00:34:04,517
他就开始发狂
He went berserk.

545
00:34:04,554 --> 00:34:06,145
他跑出了房间
He ran out of the room.

546
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:08,091
我当时正要穿衣服
I was trying to dress,

547
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:10,695
他就跑回来了 手里还拿着那个瓶子
he come back in with this bottle.

548
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:13,009
我当时还半裸着身子
I was half-naked

549
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:16,281
他就把硫酸直接往我身上泼
and he threw it straight at me.

550
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:20,131
那个本子在哪里?
Where is this book?

551
00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:21,546
-我不知道 -你想啊
-I don't know. -Think.

552
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:22,920
不 不
No, no.

553
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:24,213
在书房里还是在卧室里?
In the study in the bedroom?

554
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:26,519
那是一年多以前的事情了
It's more than a year since I was there.

555
00:34:26,556 --> 00:34:27,948
那你可以记起来的 Kitty 想啊
Than you can remember Kitty think.

556
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,428
在书房里
In the study,

557
00:34:32,313 --> 00:34:34,561
在写字台的后面
back of the bureau.

558
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,247
谢谢 Kitty 谢谢
Thank you, Kitty, thank you.

559
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,956
Winter小姐的伤疤 也打动不了Merville小姐吗?
Ms. Winter's scars could not move Ms. Merville?

560
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:45,561
她很震惊 但很快就平静了
She was shocked but recovered instantly.

561
00:34:45,598 --> 00:34:46,771
天哪
Good heavens,

562
00:34:47,521 --> 00:34:48,915
似乎太没人性了
it seems inhuman.

563
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:52,437
我承认 我心里多少有些想看 她和Gruner的好戏
I confess that part of me could wish her joy with Gruner.

564
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,563
在知道了这件事情后 还任由她被命运摆布吗?
Abandon her to her fate after all this?

565
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,424
当我把Merville小姐跟Kitty对比的时候
When I compare Ms. Merville with Kitty

566
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:58,476
我确实是这样想的
whose spirit is as fine

567
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,313
Kitty的身体是受到玷污了 可她的心灵还是纯洁的
as her body is blemished, yes.

568
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,358
你不会放弃这个案子了吧?
You wouldn't withdraw from the case?

569
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:03,476
不用担心 华生
Have no fear, Watson,

570
00:35:04,327 --> 00:35:09,359
我对Merville小姐的厌恶 与我要让Gruner受挫的决心相比 算不了什么
my disgust with Ms. Merville counts as  nothing against my determination to foil Gruner.

571
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:11,940
有一件事情让我懊恼
One thing irks me,

572
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,526
那就是我初次与Kitty见面的时候
that I've not paid more regard

573
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:16,123
我没有多留意她的举止
to Kitty's deportment when we first met,

574
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,351
还有她头发的样式
the manner in which she dressed her hair.

575
00:35:18,388 --> 00:35:20,813
啊 太晚了
Huh, it's late.

576
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:24,772
我们该走了
We must be gone.

577
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:30,633
我的诊所还有堆积如山的事情 要完成呢 福尔摩斯
I've got a mountain of work to do at the surgery Holmes

578
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,744
明早再见你了
so I'll see you in the morning.

579
00:35:31,782 --> 00:35:33,584
那明天见
Until tomorrow then.

580
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,142
好啊 歇洛克.福尔摩斯 看我们怎么收拾你
All right, Sherlock Holmes, let's be having you.

581
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:53,355
啊 我知道是谁指使你们的
Ah and I can guess to whom I owe this pleasure.

582
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:34,743
歇洛克.福尔摩斯受到致命袭击! 看报看报!
Read all about it.

583
00:36:35,189 --> 00:36:37,588
歇洛克.福尔摩斯受到致命袭击!

00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,185
歇洛克.福尔摩斯受到致命袭击!

00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:47,763
歇洛克.福尔摩斯受到致命袭击!
Murderous attack on Sherlock Holmes,

587
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,333
看报看报!

00:36:50,244 --> 00:36:52,133
看报看报!

589
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:54,986
歇洛克.福尔摩斯受到了致命袭击!
Murderous attack on Sherlock Holmes.

590
00:37:13,754 --> 00:37:15,273
没事的 华生
It's all right, Watson,

591
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,054
别一副吓坏的样子
don't look so scared.

592
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:20,319
你不该说话的
You mustn't talk.

593
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:24,359
胡说 我得说话
Nonsense, I need to.

594
00:37:26,304 --> 00:37:28,857
我该怎么做呢 福尔摩斯?
What can I do, Holmes?

595
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:32,438
肯定是那个该死的奥地利人
Of course it was that damned Austrian.

596
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:35,546
你发话吧
Give me the word

597
00:37:35,582 --> 00:37:37,465
我马上去狠揍他一顿
and I'll go and thrash the hide off him.

598
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:39,551
我的好华生
Good old Watson,

599
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:41,785
不不不 不用的
no, no, no, no.

600
00:37:42,953 --> 00:37:44,172
这两个人
Was it the same pair

601
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,391
是不是袭击Johnson和Winter小姐的那两个?
that attacked Johnson and Ms. Winter?

602
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,588
有一个也许是的
One may have been,

603
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:51,709
另一个嘛  我怀疑不是
the other I doubt it

604
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,924
不过这个想法提醒了我
but (unintelligible).

605
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:58,420
我们必须给Johnson捎个口信
We must send a note to Johnson.

606
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,378
让他给Kitty在市郊 找一处安静的安身之所
Tell him to find a quiet suburb for Kitty.

607
00:38:02,415 --> 00:38:06,382
她必须呆在那里 直到危险过去
She should stay there until the danger has passed.

608
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,011
然后...
And then,

609
00:38:11,024 --> 00:38:14,353
我们必须夸大我的伤势
then we must exaggerate my injuries.

610
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,988
没必要那样做
There's no need for that.

611
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:19,500
就算如此 我们也得给媒体来点轰动的消息
Even so we must lay it on thick for the press.

612
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:22,099
我也许活不过这个星期了
I might not live the week out,

613
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:23,263
脑震荡 说胡话
concussion, delirium,

614
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,117
你想怎么说都行
I don't care what would you like?

615
00:38:27,366 --> 00:38:30,308
要让他们收到最沉重的消息
They must receive the gravest bulletins.

616
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:32,135
还有什么吗?
Anything more?

617
00:38:32,172 --> 00:38:34,381
有的
Yes.

618
00:38:35,135 --> 00:38:39,322
把我的烟斗和烟条放在桌子上
Put my pipe on the table and the tobacco slip.

619
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,503
你必须休息 不可以抽烟
You must rest not smoke.

620
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:49,941
好的 医生
Very well, Doctor.

621
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:08,935
噢 我最亲爱的
Oh my dearest

622
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,939
对我而言你一天比一天更让我珍爱
every day you become more precious to me.

623
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,139
怎么啦?
What is it?

624
00:39:19,097 --> 00:39:21,018
就是...
It's just that,

625
00:39:21,055 --> 00:39:23,997
你非去美国不可吗?
must you really go to America?

626
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:26,710
噢 亲爱的
Oh, my darling,

627
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,493
只不过是短途旅行罢了
it's only a short trip.

628
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:31,598
我在芝加哥有很重要的金融业务
I have important financial business,

629
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:34,126
和某些产权需要管理
certain interests to regulate in Chicago

630
00:39:34,162 --> 00:39:35,670
不过我会很快回来的
but I shall be back so soon,

631
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,571
就一眨眼的工夫
in the twinkle of an eye.

632
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,140
晚报 先生
The late editions, sir.

633
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,968
谢谢
Thank you.

634
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,643
你看过报纸了吗?
Have you seen the papers?

635
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,904
那可怜的福尔摩斯
That poor man Holmes,

636
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:48,139
一天不如一天
he sinks daily.

637
00:39:49,302 --> 00:39:51,178
恐怕你不能指望我
I'm afraid you cannot expect me

638
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:53,289
对福尔摩斯先生和他的不幸
to have very much sympathy with Mr. Holmes

639
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:54,558
怀有什么同情心
and his misfortune.

640
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:57,913
嗯 得了脑炎
Mmm, encephalitis has set in.

641
00:40:02,674 --> 00:40:03,908
你读了新闻吗?
Have you seen the news?

642
00:40:03,945 --> 00:40:04,720
没有
No.

643
00:40:04,757 --> 00:40:07,727
星期五Gruner 要坐Ruratania号去美国了
Gruner sales for America on the Ruratania on Friday.

644
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:10,197
震撼性的消息
News hits hard.

645
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:12,851
星期五 那意味着他将从利物浦出发
Friday, that means he sails from Liverpool

646
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,777
而不是从南安普顿出发
not from Southampton.

647
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:17,297
那个小流氓想摆脱我们
That little rascal means to get away from us

648
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,960
但是他逃不了
but he won't.

649
00:40:18,997 --> 00:40:22,006
我发誓他逃不了
By the Lord Harry he won't.

650
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:27,475
华生 我需要你去做件事
Watson, I need you to do something for me.

651
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:29,545
尽管差遣
I'm here to be used.

652
00:40:29,582 --> 00:40:31,697
那未来的24小时
Then spend the next 24 hours

653
00:40:31,734 --> 00:40:35,337
你要深入钻研中国瓷器
in an intensive study of Chinese pottery.

654
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:17,744
哇 1368年到1390年
Wow, 1368-1390,

655
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:20,415
他睡了 先生
He's sleeping now, sir.

656
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:22,561
应该是吗啡的作用
That would be the morphine.

657
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,090
您不会熬通宵吧?
You won't let the lamp smoke, will you?

658
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:28,829
不 不会的 下面的门锁了吗?
No, no, no, you locked up below?

659
00:42:29,723 --> 00:42:31,067
我刚才锁上了
I did that a while back,

660
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:32,821
附近可是有杀人凶手啊
there's murderous folk about.

661
00:42:32,858 --> 00:42:35,832
没错 没错
True, true.

662
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:38,214
不要强迫自己太用功了 先生
Don't drive yourself too hard, sir,

663
00:42:38,251 --> 00:42:40,151
否则明天早上你什么也干不了
you'll be good for nothing in the morning.

664
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:42,554
不会的 我就快好了
No, I shan't be long.

665
00:42:46,707 --> 00:42:47,779
Hill Barton医生
Dr. Hill Barton,

666
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,013
半月街369号
369 Half Moon Street,

667
00:42:50,051 --> 00:42:51,732
西区的上流社区啊 这人是谁?
Mayfair West, who's this?

668
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:52,761
是你
You.

669
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,346
我?
Me?

670
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:57,880
这就是你今晚要用的名字 Hill Barton
That is your name this evening, Dr. Hill Barton.

671
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:58,778
是嘛?
It is?

672
00:42:58,814 --> 00:43:00,755
是的 而且你将会拜访Baron Gruner
Yes, and you'll call upon Baron Gruner

673
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,574
大概在八点半左右
about half past eight.

674
00:43:02,611 --> 00:43:04,578
他那时会有空
He'll be disengaged.

675
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,917
我已经派人捎去口信 说你会去拜访他
I sent a note telling him that you'll call.

676
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:13,893
而且 你得带上这个
Also, that you're bringing this.

677
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:20,387
这可是真正的明朝青花瓷
It is the real eggshell of the Ming Dynasty.

678
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:23,368
完整的一套可是价值连城
The complete set would be worth a king's ransom.

679
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:25,204
你是一个收藏家
You are a collector.

680
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:27,400
这套瓷器到了你手里
The set has come your way.

681
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:29,916
你听说了Baron的爱好
You've heard of the Baron's interest

682
00:43:29,952 --> 00:43:32,645
打算把它卖个好价钱
and an investor is selling at a price.

683
00:43:33,439 --> 00:43:34,246
什么价钱?
What price?

684
00:43:34,284 --> 00:43:35,280
要是你说它举世无双
We will not exaggerate

685
00:43:35,317 --> 00:43:37,421
也并非夸大其词
if you say it would hardly matched in the world.

686
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:39,283
这碗是James爵士替我找来的
Sir James got it for me.

687
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:41,844
来自他的一个主顾的收藏品
It comes from a collection of his client.

688
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:43,781
或者我可以说
Or I could say that

689
00:43:43,818 --> 00:43:45,375
应该由专家来估价
it should be valued by an expert.

690
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:48,026
噢 华生 你今天的脑子真是灵光啊
Oh, Watson, you scintillate today.

691
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:50,182
我建议由Sotheby或是Christie来鉴定
I suggest Sotheby's or Christie.

692
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,413
你肯定他会见我吗?
You're certain he'll see me?

693
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,917
当然了
Oh, yes, it's the collection mania

694
00:43:54,954 --> 00:43:57,290
他对收藏有着疯狂的热爱
in its most acute form.

695
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,778
我还要问最后一个问题 福尔摩斯
One last question, Holmes.

696
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:03,754
为什么你要我冒充一个古董经纪人呢?
Why have you made me a broker in antiques?

697
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:04,956
为了赢得时间
To gain time,

698
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:10,081
得到像这样一套瓷器的机会
the opportunity to acquire the set such as this

699
00:44:10,118 --> 00:44:12,134
也许会让Baron
may persuade the Baron

700
00:44:12,171 --> 00:44:15,587
推迟去美国的行程
to postpone his visit to the United States.

701
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,248
现在我明白了
Now I understand.

702
00:44:17,285 --> 00:44:20,170
简单的心理学罢了 华生
Elementary psychology, Watson?

703
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:38,442
去Kingston  司机
Kingston please driver.

704
00:45:15,352 --> 00:45:17,071
很好
Very fine.

705
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:27,233
非常好
Very fine indeed.

706
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:37,040
你是说你有相应的一整套?
And you say you have a set to correspond?

707
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:48,273
我知道在英国只有一个可以与它相匹配
I know of only one in England to match it.

708
00:45:51,271 --> 00:45:55,912
要是我问你是怎么得到这个的
Would it be indiscreet of me

709
00:45:55,949 --> 00:45:58,842
会不会有些唐突?
if I were to ask how you obtained this?

710
00:46:02,778 --> 00:46:04,376
从哪里得到的真有关系吗?
Does it really matter?

711
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,782
当然有关系了
Of course it matters

712
00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:11,480
像这样珍贵的藏品 出处就意味着一切
with precious objects such as these provenance is all.

713
00:46:11,516 --> 00:46:13,827
呃 你都看到了 这个可是真品
Well you can see the piece is genuine.

714
00:46:14,594 --> 00:46:17,407
至于价值嘛...
As to the value I'm perfectly content

715
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,585
请专家来估价最好了
to take an expert's assessment.

716
00:46:21,409 --> 00:46:24,448
我想你就是专家吧 Hill Barton医生
I had supposed you were an expert, Dr. Hill Barton.

717
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:28,211
我说的是中立方的估价
I meant an independent assessment.

718
00:46:28,249 --> 00:46:29,724
当然可以了
Of course.

719
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:36,018
我最近刚得到了一些青瓷
I have some recently acquired pieces of celadon

720
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:37,954
你想看看吗?
you might care to view?

721
00:46:39,014 --> 00:46:40,683
当然了
By all means.

722
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,218
请吧
Please.

723
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:51,653
完美无瑕
It's flawless.

724
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:55,401
典型的12世纪的宋代瓷器
Typical 12th Century Sung, I'd say,

725
00:46:56,395 --> 00:46:58,264
你觉得呢?
wouldn't you?

726
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,248
你说得没错
You're right.

727
00:47:09,402 --> 00:47:10,863
那这个呢?
And this?

728
00:47:20,019 --> 00:47:21,521
我得说
That's an excellent example,

729
00:47:21,558 --> 00:47:23,515
这是非常出色的秦朝瓷器
Ching Dynasty I should say

730
00:47:23,553 --> 00:47:27,148
大概在公元265年
circa 265 A.D.

731
00:47:28,867 --> 00:47:30,758
完全正确
Precisely.

732
00:47:36,777 --> 00:47:39,363
那这些呢?
And these?

733
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,992
经典的青花瓷 对吧?
Typical of celadon would you say?

734
00:47:42,029 --> 00:47:43,361
让我看看 让我看看
Give me time, give me time.

735
00:47:43,398 --> 00:47:45,665
我会让你看的 先生
I am giving you time, sir.

736
00:47:45,703 --> 00:47:47,720
没错
Quite so.

737
00:47:47,757 --> 00:47:50,498
我想听听你对
I should also be interested in your views

738
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,863
明朝洪武年间瓷器上印记的看法
on the marks of the Hung Wu.

739
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,966
洪武瓷器的印记?
Marks of the Hung Wu?

740
00:47:56,629 --> 00:47:59,671
这可是个争论不休的问题
That's a vexed question.

741
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,731
的确是个争论不休的问题 先生
Vexed question indeed, sir.

742
00:48:03,035 --> 00:48:05,559
真正的洪武瓷器是没有印记的
There are no marks on the genuine Hung Wu.

743
00:48:05,596 --> 00:48:07,872
真是让人难以忍受 先生
This is intolerable, sir.

744
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:09,549
我来这里是想给你点好处的
I came here to do you a favor,

745
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,905
而不是来做一个受拷问的学童
not to be examined as if I were a schoolboy.

746
00:48:11,942 --> 00:48:13,748
你是来这儿侦查
You came here to spy.

747
00:48:13,785 --> 00:48:15,151
不是的
Not so.

748
00:48:15,188 --> 00:48:16,577
也许你觉得
You may have found it easy

749
00:48:16,613 --> 00:48:18,348
撒个谎 伪装个身份
to inveigle your way in here

750
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:20,251
进入我的屋子很容易
upon false pretenses

751
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:22,262
但是我发誓 先生
but by god sir,

752
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:26,182
你会发现从这儿出去很难
you shall find it harder to get out.

753
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:30,856
把你的手举过头顶 华生医生
Raise your hands above your head, Dr. Watson.

754
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:34,367
怎么回事?
What's that?

755
00:48:36,177 --> 00:48:38,798
福尔摩斯 你!
Holmes, you.

756
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:40,609
不许动
Don't move.

757
00:48:43,213 --> 00:48:46,159
我会射穿你的脑袋
I shall shoot you through the head

758
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:48,724
而不是心脏
rather than the heart

759
00:48:50,129 --> 00:48:52,195
然后我会告知警方
and inform the police

760
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,558
说我把你误认成盗贼了
I mistook you for a common burglar.

761
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:57,805
我以前也扮过小偷
That is a role that I've played before

762
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,223
而且还成功了
with some success.

763
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,242
毫无疑问 先生
Without any doubt, sir,

764
00:49:02,279 --> 00:49:05,557
这是你最后一次演出了
this will be your last time.

765
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:07,188
-Baron! -Kitty!
-Baron! -Kitty!

766

恶有恶报
Be done by your debt.

767
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:20,122
医生 医生 救我 救我
Doctor, doctor, help me, help me.

768
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,363
打电话给Baron的医生

769
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:51,365

Ah, Sir James,

770
00:49:51,402 --> 00:49:53,335
请原谅我这么晚来打扰
forgive me for summoning you at this late hour

771
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:58,107
但是事情紧急 你必须在苏格兰场 掺和进来之前 得到这个
but there's no time to be lost. You must have this before Scotland Yard bumbles in.

772
00:49:58,144 --> 00:49:59,141
苏格兰场?
Scotland Yard?

773
00:49:59,178 --> 00:50:03,331
Baron Gruner要指控我们 指控华生冒名顶替
Baron Gruner's laid a complaint against us, Watson as an impostor,

774
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:04,273
而我则是入室盗窃

775
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,101
我们两个都是
we were both.

776
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:06,644
我转移了Gruner的注意力
I diverted Gruner's attention

777
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,900
而福尔摩斯则找到了那个
while Holmes procured that.

778
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:11,670
你必须把这个拿给Merville小姐看
You must show it to Ms. Merville,

779
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:14,524
她会发现自己只是上百个女人之一

所玩的游戏的记录

782
00:50:20,004 --> 00:50:22,029
也许最终可以

783
00:50:22,066 --> 00:50:23,422
让Merville小姐睁开眼睛
open Ms. Merville's eyes.

784
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:26,245
你真是干得太妙了 福尔摩斯先生 太妙了
You've done wonders, Holmes, wonders.

785
00:50:26,283 --> 00:50:29,076
除了Kitty Winter
Except for Kitty Winter.

786
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:31,582
华生解释吧 我得休息了
Watson explain, I must rest.

787
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:34,382
Winter小姐是Gruner以前的一个情妇
Ms. Winter is a former mistress of Gruner's,

788
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:35,475
她跟踪我到了Kingston
she followed me to Kingston,

789
00:50:35,512 --> 00:50:37,981
身上藏了一瓶硫酸
concealed about her was a flask of vitriol.

790
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:39,655
她把硫酸都泼到Gruner身上了
Which she unleashed upon Gruner.

791
00:50:39,692 --> 00:50:42,085
他的右手严重受伤

792
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:44,862
还有他的脸

793
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,565
他将终身毁容
He will be disfigured for life.

794
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:49,680
但是如果这些伤
But surely if these injuries

795
00:50:49,717 --> 00:50:51,890
像你描述的那么可怕
are as terrible as you described them

796
00:50:51,928 --> 00:50:54,307
那我们的目的就达到了啊...
then our purpose is sufficiently gained...

797
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,151
她会更爱他
She'd love him the more

798
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:58,638
把他当成一个毁了容的殉道者
as a disfigured martyr.

799
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:03,511
我们应该毁掉的 是他的道德形象而不是他的容貌
It is his moral side not his physical which we have to destroy.

800
00:51:03,548 --> 00:51:05,538
那个本子将会让她彻底清醒
That book will bring her down to earth

801
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:06,975
我想没有别的能做到这一点
and I knew nothing else that could.

802
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:08,610
都是他亲手写的
It's in his own handwriting,

803
00:51:08,647 --> 00:51:10,272
她肯定认得出来
she cannot get past it.

804
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:14,077
福尔摩斯 我和我的委托人对您感激不尽
Neither my client nor myself can thank you enough, Holmes.

805
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:16,940
要是Winter小姐甚至是你本人
Should either Ms. Winter or even you yourself

806
00:51:16,977 --> 00:51:18,334
被警方为难
be incommoded by the police

00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,097
不过说实在的
but to tell the truth,

810
00:51:23,134 --> 00:51:27,021
我从未受到苏格兰场的骚扰
I rarely if ever find myself inconvenienced by Scotland Yard.

晚安
Good night.

00:51:29,952 --> 00:51:31,811

福尔摩斯 我发现我们委托人的身份了
Holmes, I've discovered the identity of our client.

822
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:19,492
原来就是...

一位忠诚的朋友和一位古道热肠的绅士
A loyal friend and a chivalrous gentleman,

824
00:52:21,483 --> 00:52:22,812
不管是现在还是将来

00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,192
我们知道这一点就够了
