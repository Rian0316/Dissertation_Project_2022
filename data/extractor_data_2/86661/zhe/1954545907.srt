00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:48,297
楼下有位绅士
There's a gentlemen downstairs...

5
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:52,820
让他等一会儿 哈德森夫人
Ask him to wait a moment, Mrs. Hudson.

6
00:00:52,821 --> 00:00:56,196
他非常坚持
He's most insistent.

7
00:03:05,028 --> 00:03:06,452
现在放松
Easy now.

8
00:03:06,526 --> 00:03:08,745
放松
Easy.

9
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,807
我必须道歉
I must apologize.

10
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,934
我有点劳累过度了
I have been a little overwrought.

11
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,178
我是医生 先生
I'm a doctor, sir,

12
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:15,990
现在你必须放松
and I must insist that you relax yourself

13
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,644
在吃东西前先不要讲话
and say nothing until you have eaten.

14
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:18,496
谢谢
Thank you.

15
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,057
如果您给我点饼干和牛奶
If I might have a biscuit and a glass of milk

16
00:03:22,128 --> 00:03:23,826
那样的话我一定会好些
I have no doubt I should soon be better.

17
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,621
哈德森夫人现在正准备吃的呢
Mrs. Hudson is preparing something at this moment.

18
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:30,965
拜托 请原谅我的衰弱
Please, please, please forgive this weakness.

19
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,157
我真的必须...
I really must...

20
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:35,149
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

21
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:38,772
听您吩咐
At your service.

22
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,754
文学硕士
Master of arts.

23
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,705
哲学博士
Doctor of Philosophy.

24
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,336
修道学校的校长
Principal of the Priory School.

25
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,972
哈克斯达堡博士 像您这样显贵的漂流者 
Is it not everyday, Doctor Huxtable,

26
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,107
在我家炉前的地毯上遇难
that so distinguished a castaway as yourself

27
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,028
这可不是每天都有的事
is beached upon on the hearthrug.

28
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,704
为了猜测是什么风暴把您吹到这里
In speculating what storm had blown you here,

29
00:03:53,786 --> 00:03:55,840
我擅自查看了您的个人物品
I took the liberty of searching your person,

30
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,404
希望您会原谅
I hope you will forgive me.

31
00:03:57,477 --> 00:03:59,138
是的 当然可以
Oh yes, yes of course.

32
00:03:59,218 --> 00:04:01,853
请坐
Please sit down.

33
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:03,217
您的表
Your watch.

34
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:04,920
以前的三十年里没出现一点瑕疵
Unblemished for at least thirty years,

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,893
然而今天早上却被刮花了
suddenly this morning scratched.

36
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,465
当您把这些硬币揣进背心口袋里时
When you thrust those coins,

37
00:04:10,537 --> 00:04:12,614
在无意之中将其划破了
unthinkingly into your waistcoat pocket.

38
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:17,288
一生的严习被置于不顾
The stern habit of a lifetime trampled under foot.

39
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:19,132
这件事可能微不足道
A small occurrence perhaps

40
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,119
但值得思考
but own small think in a way

41
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,033
一根颤动的针
that a vibrating needle

42
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:25,994
可能就预示着一场地震
may signal an earthquake.

43
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,124
你脏乱的胡须表明
The state of your beard demonstrates

44
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:30,271
你的生活方式被明显打乱了
a considerable disruption to your routine.

45
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,778
在三天前?
Three days ago?

46
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:32,859
是的 先生
Yes sir.

47
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,462
是的 先生
Yes sir.

48
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:37,108
福尔摩斯先生 我请求你与我一同
Mr. Holmes, I beg you to accompany me

49
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,090
立即北上前往麦克尔顿
north to Mackleton immediately.

50
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,040
这是极为重要的事情
A matter of the utmost importance.

51
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,628
恕难从命
Awe, I regret.

52
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,233
华生大夫和我
Doctor Watson and I

53
00:04:46,304 --> 00:04:48,879
目前焦头烂额
are extremely pressed just at the moment.

54
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:52,145
我要处理费尔斯文件案
I'm retained in the case of the Ferrers Documents,

55
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,260
华生大夫还告诉我
and Doctor Watson tells me

56
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,567
他正为目前猩红热的流行
that he's run off his feet

57
00:04:54,568 --> 00:04:56,624
忙得不可开交
by this recent epidemic of this Scarlet Fever.

58
00:04:56,626 --> 00:04:57,630
而且阿巴加文尼
And then of course, 

59
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,997
谋杀案马上就要开审了
there's Abergavenny murder coming off trial. 

60
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,536
现在 唯有极其重要的案件
Now, only a very important issue

61
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:02,039
才能引起我们的注意
could call us away at the present.

62
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,179
重要的 先生?
Important, sir?

63
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:05,168
重要的案件?
Important?

64
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,178
请问您听说过
I dare say you've heard of

65
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,991
霍尔得芮斯公爵吗?
the Duke of Holdernesse?

66
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:13,392
前内阁大臣?
The former cabinet minister?

67
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:16,139
不仅如此 华生
More than that, Watson.

68
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,239
他名字背后的头衔
The letters after his name, huh,

69
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,387
可是数不胜数
almost half the alphabet.

70
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,662
国王最伟大的臣民之一
One of the greatest subjects of the crown,

71
00:05:23,743 --> 00:05:25,059
是吗 哈克斯达堡博士?
hey Doctor Huxtable?

72
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,833
不但是最伟大的
One of the greatest and probably

73
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:29,415
而且还是最富有的人
one of the wealthiest.

74
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,063
容我骄傲地宣布 他也是我的邻居
He is also, I'm proud to say, in my neighbor.

75
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,611
霍尔得芮斯府 他的乡间住宅
Holdernesse Hall, his countryseat,

76
00:05:35,687 --> 00:05:38,916
离修道院公学很近
is across from the valley from the Priory School.

77
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:42,474
公爵深居简出
Duke is an intensely solitary man.

78
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:46,336
他回避公众的视线
He appalls the prospect of public scrutiny

79
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:48,777
但在此事上 这也成了他焦虑的来源
but such is his anxiety in this matter

80
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:50,762
公爵大人已经准备好
that his grace is prepared to write a check

81
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:54,873
花五千英磅来掩人耳目
for five thousand pounds to see the business off

82
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:56,750
另一千英磅
and another thousand pounds

83
00:05:56,827 --> 00:06:00,579
使坏人得到应有的惩罚
to see justice visited upon the villains.

84
00:06:02,817 --> 00:06:05,915
事情就是如此重要
That is how important it is.

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,544
诱人的回报 哈克斯达堡博士
A princely offer, Doctor Huxtable.

86
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,599
但您并没有陈述案情
You have failed in describing villainy.

87
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:22,037
请原谅
Forgive me.

88
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,898
萨特尔勋爵 公爵的独子
Lord Saltire, the Duke's son, his only child,

89
00:06:25,976 --> 00:06:28,861
被绑架了
has been abducted.

90
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:32,904
从修道公学里吗
From the Priory School?

91
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,746
是的
Yes.

92
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:37,530
在你的管护下?
When he was in your care?

93
00:06:37,608 --> 00:06:39,377
不错
Quite.

94
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:43,277
此事就发生在三天前?
And this abduction happened three days ago?

95
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:44,945
上周六的晚上
Last Saturday night.

96
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:47,390
你为何过了这么久才来找我
Why have you waited so long before consulting me?

97
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:49,163
公爵大人担心
His Grace has a deep horror

98
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,736
这会把他的家庭不幸
of his family unhappiness

99
00:06:50,808 --> 00:06:52,648
公之于众
being dragged before the world.

100
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,564
公爵要求警方
The police have been requested by the Duke

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,382
带着这种警戒行事 他们...
to proceed with such caution that they...

102
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,859
我明白了
I see.

103
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,869
事件处理得极为不妥当
This affair has been deplorably handled.

104
00:07:04,947 --> 00:07:07,975
我不得不承认
I feel it and admit it.

105
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,755
索要多少赎金呢?
What form of the demand for ransom take?

106
00:07:10,832 --> 00:07:12,423
没有
There has been none.

107
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:13,751
不要赎金?
No demand for ransom?

108
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:15,323
不要
None.

109
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:16,785
有一件事
It is one of the most

110
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,557
最为令人困惑
perplexing aspects of the business

111
00:07:18,634 --> 00:07:22,243
那就是男孩并不是唯一失踪的人
for the boy was not alone in his flight.

112
00:07:22,413 --> 00:07:24,987
德育教师赫尔・黑底格
Herr Heidegger, the German master,

113
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:27,647
也失踪了
is also missing,

114
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:30,537
顺便说一句 连同他的自行车
as indeed, by the way, is his bicycle.

115
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,348
如果是他绑架了男孩
If he has abducted the boy

116
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:34,645
为何没有接到索要赎金的要求呢
why has no demand for money been received?

117
00:07:34,724 --> 00:07:36,635
黑底格是从瑞士来投奔我的
Heidegger came to me from Switzerland

118
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,965
对他的评价一向很好
with the very best references.

119
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:42,140
只有一辆自行车丢失吗
Was any other bicycle missing?

120
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,566
是的
Oh no.

121
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,887
你确定吗      确定
You're certain?        Right.

122
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,017
艾威灵先生检查过所有的自行车
Quite Mr. Aveling checked all the bicycles.

123
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:48,856
哈克斯达堡博士 你的意思是
Doctor Huxtable do you really mean to suggest

124
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,091
这个德语教师骑着自行车
that this German master rode off upon his bicycle

125
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:53,454
把男孩夹在腋下
in the dead of night

126
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,121
在黑夜出逃吗?
bearing the boy in his arms?

127
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,792
不是
No.

128
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:59,378
那你得出的是什么结论?
Then what is this theory in your mind?

129
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:02,477
自行车可能是个障眼法
The bicycle may have been a blind.

130
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:04,248
他可能把车藏在什么地方
He may have hidden it somewhere,

131
00:08:04,328 --> 00:08:05,953
双双步行离开
and the pair gone off on foot.

132
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,195
当然他也可以藏上两辆自行车
Surely he would have hidden a couple of bicycles

133
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,972
如果他想造成这种假象的话
if he desired to give that impression.

134
00:08:11,048 --> 00:08:12,508
我想是的
Yes I suppose he would.

135
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,427
当然他会 哈克斯达堡博士
Of course he would. Doctor Huxtable,

136
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:19,509
你的障眼法理论显然说不通
this blind theory of yours will not do.

137
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,232
但这也算是
It is an admirable starting point

138
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:28,089
一个调查的良好开端
for an investigation.

139
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,205
华生 你能马上叫辆马车吗
Watson, would you send for the cab immediately?

140
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:36,081
现在吗 福尔摩斯
Now Holmes?

141
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,504
叫车 收拾东西
Set, and pack.

142
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:41,600
我们刚好
We got just enough time

143
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,530
可以赶上从圣潘拉斯出发的午夜火车
to catch the overnight train from St Pancras.

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,141
哈克斯达堡博士 我将去你那里
Doctor Huxtable I shall do a little

145
00:08:45,213 --> 00:08:47,053
做一点调查
work at your doors.

146
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:48,480
或许火车上不算太冷
Perhaps the train is not so cold

147
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,145
但像华生和我这样的两条老猎犬
but the two old hounds like Watson and myself

148
00:08:50,227 --> 00:08:52,447
可能会嗅出点什么来的
make get a sniff on it.

149
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:53,915
我想萨特尔勋爵
I imagine the arrival

150
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:55,377
到你的学校就读
of Lord Saltire at your school

151
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,256
对你来说一定是无尚荣耀吧
must have been quite a feather in your cap.

152
00:08:57,332 --> 00:08:59,482
是我最骄傲的时刻 福尔摩斯先生
My proudest moment, Mr. Holmes.

153
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,294
布莱克威尔发表
Ever since Blackwell's published

154
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:03,663
《哈克斯达堡对贺拉斯之管见》时
Huxtable's Sidelights on Horace,

155
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,402
在当时可是小有名气
a notable little success in his day.

156
00:09:05,482 --> 00:09:06,427
你可能听说过      没有
You may have heard of it.        No.

157
00:09:06,432 --> 00:09:09,986
那孩子有多大      九岁
How old is the boy?        Nine.

158
00:09:09,994 --> 00:09:11,289
他入学多久了?
And he's been with you how long?

159
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:14,524
从冬季学期开始
Oh since the beginning of the winter term.

160
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:18,155
一个特别的孩子 他很快适应了学校生活
An unusual boy, he seemed to be fitting in well.

161
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:21,566
他 呃..
He um...

162
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:23,754
怎么了
Yes?

163
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,533
我正要说
I was about to say

164
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,460
他在家里过得不怎么开心
he was not entirely happy at home.

165
00:09:28,537 --> 00:09:30,971
公爵的婚姻不算幸福
The Duke's marriage has not been a peaceful one.

166
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:34,691
去年双方协议分居
It ended in separation by mutual consent last year.

167
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,230
公爵夫人搬回了
The Duchess has returned

168
00:09:36,304 --> 00:09:38,666
她父亲在威尼斯的府邸
to her father's palatso in Venice.

169
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,149
关于公爵的婚姻状况
This picture, of the Duke's marriage,

170
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:43,648
你是如何得知的?
how did you come by it?

171
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:45,631
这事人尽皆知吗?
Is it common knowledge?

172
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,519
我跟瓦尔德先生私下聊过几次
I've had some confidential talks with Mr. Wilder,

173
00:09:48,596 --> 00:09:49,843
他是公爵的秘书
the Duke's secretary.

174
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,415
他提供了很多信息
He's been most helpful.

175
00:09:51,488 --> 00:09:54,301
我想已经证实
And I suppose it has been established

176
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,004
那孩子并没有
that the boy has not returned

177
00:09:56,084 --> 00:09:57,365
去意大利找他母亲吧
to his mother in Italy?

178
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:58,583
是的 已经证实了
Oh yes. Yes it has.

179
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,299
我无法告诉你 福尔摩斯先生
I cannot tell you, Mr. Holmes,

180
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,583
这对我是多大的心理安慰...
what a relief it is to me...

181
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,420
华生
Watson?

182
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,347
来了      您的饭 先生
Coming!        Your picnic, sir.

183
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:09,244
哈德森夫人 你怎么猜到的?
Mrs. Hudson, how did you guess?

184
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:11,682
经验而已 福尔摩斯先生
Experience, Mr. Holmes.

185
00:10:11,756 --> 00:10:13,773
这意味着这两位先生可以在火车上
Well that means the two doctors can picnic away

186
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,553
边吃饭边讨论重要问题
to their hearts content on the train.

187
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:18,436
就算是我 可能都会发现
Even I may find my appetite

188
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:20,281
在充满乡土芳香的气氛中
is keener for a few days

189
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:23,138
胃口忽然变好了呢
in the bracing atmosphere of the peat country.

190
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,009
我想我可以公正地说
I think I will do myself no injustice

191
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:32,925
修道院公学是英格兰
when I say that the Priory School

192
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:36,027
最好的预备学校
is the most select preparatory school in England.

193
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:38,319
莱瓦斯托克伯爵
Lord Leverstoke,

194
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,132
布莱克沃特的伯爵
the Earl of Blackwater,

195
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,358
以及卡其卡特・索姆兹爵士
Sir Cathcart Soames,

196
00:10:42,438 --> 00:10:46,545
他们都把自己的儿子托付给我
they all have entrusted their sons to me.

197
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:49,430
你从这儿是看不见霍尔德芮斯府的
You can't see Holdernesse Hall from here

198
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:53,022
但在礼拜堂塔上的视线是绝佳的
but there's a very fine view from the chapel tower.

199
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:55,357
这些遗址就不用看了
Heritage is skipping you.

200
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:58,901
我从那孩子的房间开始
I will begin with the boy's room.

201
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,397
他父亲写的? 
From his father?

202
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,542
是他失踪那天早上送来的
It arrived on the morning of his disappearance.

203
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:36,058
他收到过从意大利来的信吗
Had he received one from Italy?

204
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,874
最近没有
Not recently.

205
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:39,934
信在哪儿
Where is the letter now?

206
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:41,667
找不着了
It cannot be found.

207
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,279
他被绑架时
It must have been on the boy's person

208
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,940
信一定在他身上
when he was abducted.

209
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:48,464
谁睡在隔壁房间?
Who sleeps in the adjoining room?

210
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:53,455
没什么大事 你们干你们的
It's alright. Just keep going.

211
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:54,801
我敢说你这孩子
I know this sort of chap I dare say.

212
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:59,508
睡觉遇到打雷也闹不醒
He could sleep through a thunderstorm.

213
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,204
我不这么认为 先生
I don't think he would sir.

214
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,789
真的吗 你为什么这么想?
Really and why is that do you suppose?

215
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:05,286
有只老鼠 先生
There's a mouse sir.

216
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:07,305
在壁板上 先生
In the wainscot, sir.

217
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:09,434
把我们俩都吵醒了 先生
And it wakes us both up sir.

218
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:10,609
这事时而会发生 先生
Sometimes sir.

219
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,005
老鼠?
Mouse?

220
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,681
那萨特尔勋爵房间有什么声音
So any noise from Lord Saltire's room...

221
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:16,258
门的响声 先生
Well the door creaks sir.

222
00:12:16,331 --> 00:12:17,826
总会听到门响的
You always hear the door.

223
00:12:17,896 --> 00:12:20,224
他失踪的那天晚上
On the night of the disappearance,

224
00:12:20,301 --> 00:12:22,284
有听到什么异常吗?
did you hear anything then?

225
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:24,015
没有 先生
No sir.

226
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,946
甚至连哭声都没听到
You couldn't even hear the crying.

227
00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:30,883
哭声?
Crying?

228
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,275
是的 先生
Yes sir.

229
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,463
他有时会哭 先生
He sometimes cries sir.

230
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:37,085
有时而已 先生
Sometimes sir.

231
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,396
谢谢你们
Thank you boys.

232
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:49,031
在地面上没有发现什么吗?
You have found nothing in the grounds?

233
00:13:51,337 --> 00:13:53,700
我发现的东西都没很大用处
There's no knowing what I have found.

234
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,888
痕迹都被毁了
The trail is cold.

235
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:58,154
校长
Headmaster!

236
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,781
校长
Headmaster!

237
00:14:01,854 --> 00:14:03,552
霍尔德芮斯公爵到了 校长
The Duke of Holdernesse is here headmaster.

238
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,762
谢谢 艾威灵先生
Thank you, Mr. Aveling.

239
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,316
和瓦尔德先生一起
With Mr. Wilder.

240
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:11,807
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

241
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,344
是的
Yes.

242
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,645
公爵在等着呢 福尔摩斯先生
The Duke is waiting, Mr. Holmes.

243
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:19,432
怎么会没用呢
That will never do.

244
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:39,391
公爵大人
Your Grace,

245
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,927
瓦尔德先生
Mr. Wilder.

246
00:14:40,998 --> 00:14:42,909
我昨天给你打电话了 哈克斯达堡博士
I called yesterday, Doctor Huxtable,

247
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:43,896
但要阻止你去伦敦
but I was too late

248
00:14:43,898 --> 00:14:46,390
已经太晚了
to prevent your starting for London.

249
00:14:46,466 --> 00:14:48,580
哈克斯达堡博士 公爵大人很惊讶
His Grace is surprised, Doctor Huxtable,

250
00:14:48,661 --> 00:14:50,288
你在没有咨询他意见的情况下
that you should of invited Mr. Holmes

251
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,066
就擅自邀请福尔摩斯先生
to undertake an investigation

252
00:14:52,143 --> 00:14:53,841
来进行调查
without consulting him first.

253
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,689
我想警察们没有进展
Well I thought that the police had failed.

254
00:14:55,765 --> 00:14:57,081
没有确切证据表明
It is by no means certain

255
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:58,654
警察没有进展
that the police have failed.

256
00:14:58,725 --> 00:15:00,221
不错 但说实话 瓦尔德先生
Yes, but surely, Mr. Wilder...

257
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:01,824
你一定很明白 哈克斯达堡博士
You're well aware, Doctor Huxtable,

258
00:15:01,895 --> 00:15:02,838
公爵大人很焦虑
how anxious his Grace is

259
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,193
他极其想避免公众丑闻
to avoid all public scandal.

260
00:15:05,273 --> 00:15:06,969
他希望在这件事情上
He prefers to take as few people as possible

261
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:08,818
知情的人越少越好
into his confidence.

262
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:10,248
抱歉 瓦尔德先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilder.

263
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:11,854
这很容易补救的
The matter is easily remedied

264
00:15:11,925 --> 00:15:13,480
歇洛克・福尔摩斯先生可以
Mr. Sherlock Holmes can return to London

265
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:15,117
坐早晨的火车回伦敦
by the morning train.

266
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,931
不尽然
Hardly that.

267
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,920
不尽然
Hardly that.

268
00:15:18,995 --> 00:15:22,603
我喜欢北部爽朗的空气
I enjoy your invigorating northern air.

269
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,153
无论如何 我都会
I shall spend, at any rate,

270
00:15:24,154 --> 00:15:26,341
在您的旷野上度过几天
a few days upon your moors.

271
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:28,072
谁知道我会不会找到
Who knows I may at least find

272
00:15:28,153 --> 00:15:30,185
赫尔・黑底格的自行车或者别的啥东西呢
Herr Heidegger's bicycle, if nothing else.

273
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:36,089
这可不是小事 福尔摩斯先生
This is not a trivial matter, Mr. Holmes.

274
00:15:36,165 --> 00:15:40,996
我很高兴您能这么想 公爵大人
I am gratified that you think not, your Grace.

275
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,718
如果要说有什么意义 福尔摩斯先生
If there was meaning in that remark, Mr. Holmes,

276
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:48,030
恐怕我没有看出来
I'm afraid it escaped me.

277
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,222
您唯一的孩子失踪了
Your only child has disappeared.

278
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:52,179
您的希望 您的未来
Your hopes, your future,

279
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:54,058
您高贵的家族前程
your noble family itself

280
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:55,630
有断送的危险
is threatened with disillusion.

281
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,719
你想说什么 先生
Your point, sir?

282
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,331
我想问公爵大人
I ask your Grace,

283
00:16:00,403 --> 00:16:03,039
什么才是本质
what is modesty to this,

284
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:07,714
您儿子的生命对家族更重要
to your child's life?

285
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:13,248
亦或是他的名声对家族更重要?
Or his reputation?

286
00:16:13,324 --> 00:16:15,198
这个问题我暂时无法回答
Not then it might be replied

287
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:22,017
没有荣誉 还谈什么延续
what is continuance without honor?

288
00:16:22,099 --> 00:16:24,153
然而我觉得你的话基本是正确的
However, I believe you are largely in the right,

289
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,065
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

290
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,856
如果你是指
If you refer to the constraints

291
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,977
我给警方活动所设下的约束
I have placed upon the activities of the police

292
00:16:31,051 --> 00:16:34,981
或许我是有点强人所难
then perhaps I have imposed too much.

293
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:37,347
我有种病态的恐惧
I have a morbid fear

294
00:16:37,424 --> 00:16:40,796
害怕公共的注意
of the public gaze.

295
00:16:40,872 --> 00:16:42,890
如果我们不接受福尔摩斯先生的帮助
It would be foolish not to avail ourselves

296
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,180
那将是愚蠢的 詹姆斯
of Mr. Holmes' services, James,

297
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:47,549
何况他已经来了
now that he is here.

298
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:50,097
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

299
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,867
公爵大人
Your Grace?

300
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,477
或许你应该跟我们一起
Perhaps you would like to come and stay with us

301
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:55,043
住在霍尔德芮斯府
at Holdernesse Hall.

302
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,539
谢谢您 公爵大人
I thank your Grace,

303
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,559
但我想为了我的调查能顺利进行
but I think for the purposes of my investigation

304
00:16:58,633 --> 00:17:01,067
我还是留在这奇案发生的现场
it would be wiser for me

305
00:17:01,141 --> 00:17:04,749
要更加明智
to remain here at the scene of the mystery.

306
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:06,291
随你
As you wish.

307
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:07,918
瓦尔德先生或是我自己
Mr. Wilder or myself

308
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:10,115
会给你提供任何
will be available to provide you with

309
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,937
你可能需要的帮助
any assistance that you might require.

310
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:14,405
我能不能问问
Might I ask whether

311
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:16,105
对于你儿子的神秘失踪
you have formed any explanation

312
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:20,044
你想起什么起因没?
as to the mysterious disappearance of your son?

313
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:26,313
不 先生 没有
No, sir. I have not.

314
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:39,064
他是个好孩子 福尔摩斯先生
He is a fine boy, Mr. Holmes.

315
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:41,213
他到你班上多久了?
And how long has he been in your class?

316
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:43,277
从他到这儿开始
Since his arrival here.

317
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,010
关于他的家庭 他谈得多吗
Did he speak much of his family?

318
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,515
不多
Not much.

319
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:48,571
以我个人之见 他想念他母亲
It's my belief that he missed his mother

320
00:17:48,643 --> 00:17:51,497
可能这与他父亲所作所为有关 你知道...
this is something of his father's doing, do you know...

321
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:53,194
关于公爵和公爵夫人的分居
The separation between the Duke and the Duchess,

322
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:54,699
他谈起过吗
did he talk about that?

323
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,090
不见得
Not really.

324
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,978
有点神秘 那孩子强调
It's a little mysterious. The boy insisted

325
00:17:57,979 --> 00:17:59,185
他们两人互相深爱着彼此
that they loved each other very much.

326
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:00,195
你不认为不和的传闻
You don't soppose there'll be whistling

327
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:01,899
只是流言吗?
in the wind and all that?

328
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,031
不 他是个非常现实的孩子
No he is a very realistic child.

329
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:06,575
嗯 但不是个非常现实的家庭
Awe, but not a very realistic family.

330
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:08,072
有人告诉我 他们
I was told that they

331
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:10,745
曾经是地狱火俱乐部的成员
were once members of the Hellfire Club.

332
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,322
我想你应该不会知道
You wouldn't know, I suppose,

333
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,199
在失踪案的那天晚上
what time Herr Heidegger retired to his room

334
00:18:14,275 --> 00:18:16,078
赫尔・黑底格是何时回房的吧
on the night of the disappearance?

335
00:18:16,155 --> 00:18:17,996
不确切 但很晚了
Not really but quite late.

336
00:18:18,072 --> 00:18:19,352
十一点之后
After eleven.

337
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,163
他是那晚的值班老师
He was duty round master that night.

338
00:18:21,241 --> 00:18:23,675
我想他还骑自行车吧?
And a cyclists I believe?

339
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:26,182
是的 不错
Yes, oh yes.

340
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,759
萨特尔勋爵会不会骑车
Did Lord Saltire ever accompany him.

341
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:33,037
不 他还保持不了平衡
No he is not yet able to retain his balance.

342
00:18:33,118 --> 00:18:35,717
我猜你应该不会碰巧知道
You wouldn't, I suppose,

343
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:38,018
黑底格的自行车轮胎
happen to know the make of tires

344
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:40,211
是什么牌子的吧
on Herr Heidegger's bicycle?

345
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,845
当然知道
Certainly.

346
00:18:41,928 --> 00:18:44,502
布瑞门出产的 不错的自行车
A lovely bicycle by the way made in Bramen.

347
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,592
轮胎是帕默牌的
The tires were Palmer,

348
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,160
就是上面有条状花纹的那种
you know the ones with longitudinal tread.

349
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,786
这个我知道
I know the ones.

350
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,007
谢谢
Thank you.

351
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:52,333
太有用了
Doubly helpful.

352
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,630
我的荣幸 福尔摩斯先生
Pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

353
00:18:58,644 --> 00:19:01,184
晚饭八点开始
Dinner will be at eight.

354
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:14,862
请原谅
I beg your pardon.

355
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,086
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

356
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,336
这个案子吸引住我了 华生
This case grows upon me, Watson.

357
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:29,393
有几点显然
There are decidedly points of interest

358
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:30,783
与此案有重大联系
in connection with it.

359
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,150
来看看这幅地图
Here look at this map.

360
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,376
可以肯定有些地点
There are certain geographical features,

361
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:36,880
与我们的调查
which may have a good deal to do

362
00:19:36,953 --> 00:19:38,413
关系密切
with our investigation.

363
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:42,617
黑色方框是修道院公学
This dark square is the Priory School.

364
00:19:42,699 --> 00:19:45,169
这个 大路在一英里之内
This, the main road with no side turning

365
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:47,045
是没有拐弯的
for a mile either way.

366
00:19:47,122 --> 00:19:48,617
学校的北部
To the north of the school

367
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,672
地势缓缓升起
the land rises slowly.

368
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:52,443
南部
To the south,

369
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,147
一大块荒原
a large district of arable land,

370
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:55,853
有高墙和篱笆
with high walls and hedgerows,

371
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,154
骑自行车是不可能通过的
impossible territory for a bicycle.

372
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:00,036
你在奥卡堡有什么发现?
Oh what did you discover at Oakborn?

373
00:20:00,114 --> 00:20:01,846
警察在那儿
Well the police had reports

374
00:20:01,925 --> 00:20:04,144
做了全面的询问
from all over the place

375
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:06,656
是否看到一个男人跟一个男孩在一起
on a man and a boy seen together.

376
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,640
他们在今天清晨
They completed their investigation on the site

377
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:09,929
完成了这项调查
early this morning.

378
00:20:09,931 --> 00:20:11,388
什么结果?      一无所获
What result?        Useless.

379
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:13,134
跟勋爵与德语教师的特征
None bore the slightest resemblance

380
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,739
没有丝毫相似
of the boy or the German master.

381
00:20:15,433 --> 00:20:16,823
太好了
Excellent.

382
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:19,046
这些错误的观点
This mass of mistaken sightings, Watson,

383
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:22,012
证实了我的怀疑
it confirms my suspicion.

384
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:24,378
我想他们没走大路
I don't believe they used the road.

385
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:27,578
通往静谧之处的荒凉小径
That path of curiosity of quiet places

386
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,679
一定会带来发现的
will surely find the light.

387
00:20:29,751 --> 00:20:31,626
我认为他们根本就没走大路
I don't think they used the road at all.

388
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:34,098
但自行车呢
But the bicycle?

389
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:36,250
骑车高手不一定非得在大路上才能骑
A good cyclist does not need a road, Watson.

390
00:20:36,332 --> 00:20:39,704
荒原上小路错综复杂
The moor is intersected with paths.

391
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,320
我记得那时是满月
I remember the moons that were full.

392
00:20:42,392 --> 00:20:44,338
但我们问题的答案
Now it is to the north

393
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,145
一定就藏在北方
that our quest must lie.

394
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,683
你做得很好 华生
You have done well, Watson.

395
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,833
快到晚饭时间了 很高兴吧
Dinner's soon, you'll be happy to hear

396
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:51,897
但还有一点
but I have do just have one point

397
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:54,474
我需要做一些调查
on which I need to be satisfied.

398
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:56,244
赫尔・黑底格的房间
Herr Heidegger's room.

399
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:59,764
就十分钟
Ten minutes.

400
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,059
福尔摩斯博士正在探寻
Doctor Holmes is being delving

401
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,774
霍尔德芮斯家庭的起源
into the origins of the Holdernesse family.

402
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:06,386
就像许多远古的线索
Like many ancient lines

403
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:08,118
来自一条肮脏的来源
it sprang from a very muddy source.

404
00:21:08,198 --> 00:21:09,693
肮脏专家?
Muddy Doctor?

405
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:12,021
不用说得太详细了
Well not to be too delicate about it,

406
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:15,649
他们是盗牛贼
they were cattle thieves.

407
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:17,596
农民阶级 有胆有谋
A worrier class, ingenious,

408
00:21:17,672 --> 00:21:19,999
但他们钱财的来源
daring but the basis of their wealth

409
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:23,827
却与别人家的牛休戚相关
was running off with other people's cows.

410
00:21:26,237 --> 00:21:29,051
福尔摩斯甚至还告诉我 霍尔德芮斯
Holmes even tells me that Holdenesse has furnished

411
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:33,236
给地狱火俱乐部的疯子提供过资助
one of the madder members of the Hell Fire Club.

412
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:44,312
哈克斯达堡博士 怎么了
What is the matter Doctor Huxtable?

413
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,044
没什么
It is nothing.

414
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:50,506
但显然是有事的
But it's clearly something.

415
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:52,565
我的期望过高了
I expect too much I'm sure.

416
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:54,132
这是兼职
It is a part-time job.

417
00:21:54,204 --> 00:21:57,266
说说你的期望吧
Tell us your expectations?

418
00:21:57,339 --> 00:22:00,046
我不期望奇迹
I do not expect miracles.

419
00:22:00,124 --> 00:22:01,619
我想我并不是一个
I think I am not a man

420
00:22:01,691 --> 00:22:04,019
需要奇迹的人
who demands the miraculous...

421
00:22:04,095 --> 00:22:07,324
但你还是什么都没发现
but you have discovered nothing.

422
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:09,136
我们一无所获
We haven't found,

423
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:11,475
从我们离开伦敦后一点证据也没发现
not a jot since the moment we left London.

424
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,480
虽然在事实上并不是这样
Although indeed that is not true.

425
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:17,468
你发现了两件事 但都微不足道
You have discovered two things, both falsums.

426
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:20,692
一个是一条无中生有的流言
One, a squalid piece of gossip

427
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:24,172
另一个就是关于我伟大赞助人家世的
and the other an epocriful and insulting fancy

428
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:28,062
无礼猜测
about the origins of my great patron.

429
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,425
我请你们来 福尔摩斯先生
I did not employ you to come here

430
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:34,694
并不是要给霍尔德芮斯的家庭蒙羞的
to blacken the name of the Holdernesses', Mr. Holmes.

431
00:22:34,775 --> 00:22:39,216
冷静下来 哈克斯达堡博士
Calm yourself, Doctor Huxtable.

432
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,689
事实上 我们已经发现了一些线索
We have in fact, found some way,

433
00:22:42,764 --> 00:22:45,013
我可以向你陈述一些细节
I can describe to you in some detail

434
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:46,550
是关于在那个戏剧性的夜晚
what took place in this school

435
00:22:46,623 --> 00:22:49,156
学校里到底发生了什么
on that fateful night.

436
00:22:49,228 --> 00:22:51,797
以及你那极其忠诚的
Also the behavior of your excellent

437
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:54,639
德语教师的作为
and faithful German master.

438
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:57,489
忠诚的黑底格吗?
Faithful, Heidegger?

439
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:59,579
是什么 先生
What sir?

440
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,503
赫尔・黑底格在十一点过后
Herr Heidegger retired to his room

441
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,455
回到了他的房间
soon after eleven o'clock.

442
00:23:06,529 --> 00:23:08,849
他是那晚的值班人
He was the duty master that night.

443
00:23:08,925 --> 00:23:10,832
现在我的朋友兼同事 华生大夫
Now my friend and colleague, Doctor Watson,

444
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:13,298
将重现当晚的情形
will impersonate.

445
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,332
黑底格还要工作两个小时
Heidegger has still two hours work ahead of him

446
00:23:18,411 --> 00:23:21,360
他已经度过了劳累的一天
and it's been a long day.

447
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,089
他脱了外衣
He allows himself the comfort

448
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:25,598
让自己更舒服些
of removing his jacket.

449
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:29,521
他走到门边的箱柜
He moves across to the chest by the door

450
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,355
给自己倒了一杯雪莉酒
and pours himself a glass of sherry.

451
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:37,198
眼前的工作
Badly needed fortification

452
00:23:37,276 --> 00:23:40,427
十分需要酒的支撑
of the task that lies ahead.

453
00:23:46,378 --> 00:23:48,663
他拿起烛台
He collects the candle

454
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:50,435
将其放到桌上
and moves to his desk

455
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:54,918
还有22本作业要批
to correct twenty-two exercise books,

456
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:57,729
不仅包括语法练习
which contain not only Grammatik exercises

457
00:23:57,731 --> 00:24:03,356
还有一篇冗长的作文
but also a lengthy composition.

458
00:24:03,437 --> 00:24:05,686
我的观点是 哈克斯达堡博士
You see my point, Doctor Huxtable,

459
00:24:05,764 --> 00:24:07,458
如果他没再干什么别的事的话
it would have been well after midnight

460
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:09,858
当他吹灭蜡烛时
if he had done nothing else,

461
00:24:09,934 --> 00:24:14,198
应该是午夜过后了
when his candle fails him.

462
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:17,911
蜡烛放在门边的箱子里
The candles are kept in the chest by the door.

463
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:21,013
他起身想再拿一支
He arises from the desk to fetch another one

464
00:24:21,086 --> 00:24:23,714
但没有光线 他找不到蜡烛
but he cannot see to find them,

465
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,490
所以他走到窗旁
so he turns to the windows

466
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:26,642
拉开窗帘
to draw the curtains

467
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:28,065
想借助月光看得更清楚点
to see better by the moonlight.

468
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:34,902
在门塔的屋顶上
Across the rooftops on the gate tower

469
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:37,516
男孩正在等待黑暗的到来
the boy has been waiting for darkness,

470
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:42,266
这样他的逃跑就不会被发现了
knowing that his flight must not be observed.

471
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,397
赫尔・黑底格看到了
Herr Heidegger watches

472
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:47,238
那孩子翻过墙
as the boy hurries across the ledge

473
00:24:47,316 --> 00:24:53,321
去赴河边的约会
to keep his prearranged meeting by the river.

474
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:57,459
感到事态严重
Sensing the enormity of what was taking place,

475
00:24:57,531 --> 00:25:01,451
黑底格跑向门口
Heidegger runs to the door,

476
00:25:01,525 --> 00:25:03,290
就是这样碰倒了
knocking over what remains

477
00:25:03,366 --> 00:25:07,109
他喝剩的那杯雪莉酒
of his glass sherry as he goes.

478
00:25:09,552 --> 00:25:11,766
我明白了
I see.

479
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,413
谢谢
Thank you.

480
00:25:14,485 --> 00:25:16,392
看来是我低估你了
It seems I misjudged you.

481
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:18,017
他做出去追赶孩子的这一决定
The wisdom of his choice

482
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,721
其理性是值得商榷的
to pursue the boy is questionable.

483
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:23,435
我相信他的命运由此扭转了
I believe his fate may be sealed.

484
00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:25,838
请容我发问 福尔摩斯先生
You'll allow me, Mr. Holmes?

485
00:25:25,914 --> 00:25:27,300
你的意思是?
Do you mean?

486
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:29,069
我希望不是这样 但如果我的推断没错
I hope not but if my reasoning is correct

487
00:25:29,145 --> 00:25:32,296
那我真的为他担心
then I do fear for him.

488
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,071
那孩子呢?
And the boy?

489
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,246
哈克斯达堡博士 此案的关键
The key to that, Doctor Huxtable,

490
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:42,440
就在那儿
remains out there.

491
00:25:42,522 --> 00:25:44,914
就在吉尔桥的另一边
Beyond the Drover's Bridge.

492
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:04,821
可怜的牲畜
Poor beast.

493
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:09,797
报喜鸟
Carrying crows.

494
00:26:09,878 --> 00:26:13,557
他们名不符实
They ruin their name.

495
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,783
我们假设
So were assuming the boy

496
00:26:14,785 --> 00:26:17,355
那孩子被绑上马背带走了
was taken away on horseback are we not?

497
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,817
不错
Certainly.

498
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,008
否则黑底格就不会
Otherwise Heidegger would not have

499
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,255
骑自行车来追赶他们了
needed a bicycle to pursue them.

500
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:25,491
但我们只能找到牛的脚印 福尔摩斯
But the only tracks we've found are cattle, Holmes.

501
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:26,600
福尔摩斯
Holmes?

502
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:32,102
福尔摩斯 
Holmes?

503
00:26:32,184 --> 00:26:34,687
痕迹 华生
A track, Watson!

504
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,011
有痕迹
A track.

505
00:26:42,311 --> 00:26:43,804
自行车的?
A bicycle?

506
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:45,891
当然是某辆自行车的
Certainly a bicycle

507
00:26:45,962 --> 00:26:47,387
但不是我们要找的那辆
but not the bicycle.

508
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,990
我很熟悉42种
I'm familiar with forty-two

509
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:50,969
轮胎留下的不同印迹
different impressions left by tires.

510
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:54,106
这是邓洛普牌的
This is a Dunlop

511
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:57,367
外胎是加厚的
with a patch upon the outer cover.

512
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:01,551
黑底格的车胎是帕默牌的
Heidegger's tires were Palmers,

513
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:05,228
这不是黑底格的车轮留下的痕迹
this is not Heidegger's track.

514
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,449
那是谁的?
Who's then?

515
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:07,987
到底是谁的?
Who's indeed?

516
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,198
华生
Watson!

517
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,774
这个是帕默牌的
These are Palmer tracks,

518
00:27:14,846 --> 00:27:16,956
黑底格走过这条路
Heidegger has been this way.

519
00:27:22,362 --> 00:27:27,227
绝对不寻常
Absolutely extraordinary.

520
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:30,945
邓洛普的车胎痕迹行驶过150码后
Dunlop tracks for a hundred fifty yards,

521
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:32,795
就消失了
they vanish

522
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:35,504
而帕默车胎很清楚地
and Palmer tracks quite clear

523
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:37,423
指向了这些岩石
leading to these rocks,

524
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:39,515
然后也消失了
they vanish too.

525
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:43,542
到处都没有马的痕迹
Not a sign of a horse anywhere.

526
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,734
华生 对于明显痕迹的发现
Watson, you have a blazing talent

527
00:27:45,815 --> 00:27:47,962
你有惊人的天赋
for observing the obvious.

528
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,852
我应该带点午餐来的
I should have brought some luncheon.

529
00:27:54,932 --> 00:27:58,647
到底赫尔・黑底格在追什么
Anyway what was Herr Heidegger cycling after,

530
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:01,642
牛吗?
cows?

531
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:03,450
按理说他们不会用牛背
Presumably they didn't abduct the child

532
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,854
来绑架那孩子
on the back of a cow.

533
00:28:09,861 --> 00:28:13,538
马的痕迹被抹去了
All traces of horses obliterated.

534
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,458
证据显示
In much evidence the two bicycles

535
00:28:15,534 --> 00:28:17,857
两辆自行车凭空消失了
have vanished into thin air.

536
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,073
这不可能
Impossible.

537
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:19,625
绝对不可能
Precisely.

538
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:22,107
我们不可能再犯早前的错误
It is impossible as we have mistaken it,

539
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,101
所以 在某个方面
therefore, in some respect,

540
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:25,155
我们一定是理解错了
we must have mistaken it wrong.

541
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,234
荒原边上更远一点
There's a hostelry mark

542
00:28:32,305 --> 00:28:34,594
有旅店的标记
on the further edge of the moor.

543
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,819
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

544
00:28:36,899 --> 00:28:39,746
彻斯特菲尔德路上有个旅店
there's a hostelry on the Chesterfield Road.

545
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:46,183
如果我们沿着这个方向走
Yes if he we keep on this line

546
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:48,241
我们就能到了
we should come up to it.

547
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:54,852
我得到那儿去碰碰运气
Well that's where I'm going to try my luck.

548
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:56,797
我饿了
I'm hungry.

549
00:29:03,624 --> 00:29:05,700
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

550
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,241
吃午饭
Lunch.

551
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:10,752
我亲爱的朋友 你一定饿扁了
Of course my dear fellow you must be starving.

552
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:12,809
现在看看地图
Now observe that map.

553
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,169
你会看到有家旅店
You will see that there's a hostelry

554
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:18,094
沿这个方向再走三英里
about three miles in this direction.

555
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:21,159
我们一会儿要见霍尔德芮斯公爵
We'll need some food if we're going to

556
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:23,699
我们得好好吃点东西
face the Duke of Holdernesse later.

557
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:44,227
没有发现吗?
Nothing?

558
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,891
没有发现
Nothing.

559
00:29:45,972 --> 00:29:48,048
我必须告诉公爵大人
I must tell his Grace.

560
00:29:59,682 --> 00:30:02,601
没有发现吗?
Nothing?

561
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,169
没有发现
Nothing.

562
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,423
抱歉
I'm sorry.

563
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,091
抱歉
I'm sorry.

564
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:47,600
锁上了
It's locked.

565
00:30:50,176 --> 00:30:52,749
这旅店就像这板上的画
Primitive but forceful

566
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,773
破旧却可憎
as sporting portraits go.

567
00:31:03,816 --> 00:31:05,832
卢宾・黑斯先生?
Mr. Reuben Hayes?

568
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:07,456
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

569
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:10,041
门上印着的
It's printed over the door.

570
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:12,891
我们想吃点东西
We were looking for some refreshment.

571
00:31:12,968 --> 00:31:14,390
是吗?
Were ya?

572
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:16,967
您能提供的话将不胜感激
And would be obliged if you could furnish it.

573
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,186
是吗?
Would ya?

574
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:21,519
会的
We would.

575
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,515
你得问问那女人
You must ask the woman.

576
00:31:30,436 --> 00:31:34,671
可怜的人
Insufferable lout.

577
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:35,599
如果今天下午
If were going all the way

578
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,090
要去霍尔德芮斯府的话
to Holdernesse Hall this afternoon

579
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:41,150
我们可以雇几匹马
let us try to hire those unpreconditioned beasts.

580
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:43,063
你说什么?
What do you say?

581
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,814
要骑多远?
How far are you taking them?

582
00:31:57,891 --> 00:31:59,515
从这到府邸一个来回
Just to the Hall and back.

583
00:31:59,596 --> 00:32:01,815
您应该知道路程吧?
You know the way, I dare say?

584
00:32:01,893 --> 00:32:05,120
我在那儿工作了十五年
I worked there for fifteen years.

585
00:32:10,313 --> 00:32:12,366
好的 你们可以骑
Yeah, you can take them.

586
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:15,984
黑斯先生 你受伤了
My word, Mr. Hayes, you have injured yourself.

587
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,444
没事
It's nothin'.

588
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,143
我是医生 我确定你真的伤着了
I am a Doctor sir, and assure you it is.

589
00:32:23,223 --> 00:32:25,442
你应该包扎一下
You should have it attended.

590
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,145
您怎么伤到的?
How did you come by it?

591
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:32,054
我的狗咬的
One of my dogs did it.

592
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,707
那些是抓伤
Those scratches.

593
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,332
是怎么回事
What about them?

594
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,862
粗看之下 伤痕之间离得很远
Well at a gentler glance they were that far apart.

595
00:32:40,937 --> 00:32:44,056
什么动物能造成这样的抓伤呢
What animal would make such a scratch?

596
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:47,436
可能是公鸡中的战斗鸡
Probably a descendent of the champion jack.

597
00:32:47,513 --> 00:32:49,352
斗鸡是法律明文禁止的
Cockfighting is forbidden by law

598
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,715
而且被禁了五十年了
and has been for fifty years.

599
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:53,216
法律禁止的东西可多了
Many things are forbidden by law.

600
00:32:53,291 --> 00:32:56,837
在这样的地方哪有什么法律可言
What law is there in such places as these?

601
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:59,899
太棒了 黑斯夫人 谢谢你
Awe excellent, Mrs. Hayes, thank you.

602
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:02,544
你煮了什么?
What have you cooked?

603
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:08,215
血布丁 甜点和坚果
Blood pudding, sweets and nuts

604
00:33:12,917 --> 00:33:15,941
怎么样 华生
How is it, Watson?

605
00:33:16,012 --> 00:33:20,011
太恶心了 福尔摩斯
It is disgusting, Holmes.

606
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,408
那个女人
That woman,

607
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:24,324
她被什么东西吓坏了
she's frightened of something

608
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,519
或许不单是被她的丈夫
and more than that husband of hers.

609
00:33:27,601 --> 00:33:31,314
诡计一环套一环
Deception upon deception.

610
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:35,805
但这一环环都是为了隐藏什么呢?
What was it intended to hide?

611
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,100
诡计?
Deception?

612
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,327
华生
Oh, Watson,

613
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:01,588
马蹄是跛的
my horse is lame.

614
00:34:09,253 --> 00:34:11,685
太奇怪了
That's odd.

615
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:22,510
旧蹄铁 新掌钉
Old shoes, new nails.

616
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:55,459
先士们
Gentlemen.

617
00:34:55,535 --> 00:34:58,761
公爵大人现在要见你们
His Grace will see you now.

618
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:13,554
瓦尔德先生
Awe, Mr. Wilder.

619
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,326
福尔摩斯先生 华生医生
Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson,

620
00:35:15,403 --> 00:35:17,515
欢迎来到霍尔德芮斯厅
welcome to Holdernesse Hall.

621
00:35:17,596 --> 00:35:19,649
公爵大人一会儿就过来了
His Grace will be joining us shortly.

622
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:23,195
我们对您的推理绝技抱以厚望
We are placing high hopes on your skills Mr. Holmes.

623
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:25,058
您带来什么新闻了吗
Did you bring news?

624
00:35:25,072 --> 00:35:26,225
只有一点
There is just one point

625
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:27,683
我还没搞清楚
in which I need to be satisfied.

626
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:29,346
是什么 福尔摩斯先生?
Yes Mr. Holmes?

627
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:33,769
这牵扯到公爵的个人隐私
It concerns the Duke's private concerns.

628
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,493
作为公爵大人的私人秘书
As his Grace's private secretary

629
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:38,135
也许我能帮上点忙
perhaps I can be of some assistance.

630
00:35:38,138 --> 00:35:40,376
我知道在事情发生的那一天
I believe his Grace wrote to his son

631
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,711
公爵大人曾写信给他的儿子
upon the day this incident occurred.

632
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,073
不 那是在前一天写的
No I believe he wrote on the day before.

633
00:35:45,074 --> 00:35:47,721
是的 但是他是那一天收到的
Yes but he would have received it upon that day.

634
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,148
是的 很有可能
Yes, quite probably.

635
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:51,445
那封信里会不会有什么东西
Might there have been anything in that letter

636
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:53,812
诱引那孩子逃跑呢
which would have prompted the boy to run away?

637
00:35:54,422 --> 00:35:55,800
哦 我可不这么想
Oh, I hardly think so.

638
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:59,350
他能去的地方只有这里
Anyway he would have run here if anywhere.

639
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,613
也许他去意大利找她母亲呢?
Or to his mother in Italy?

640
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:04,259
不会 先生
No sir.

641
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:07,926
萨特尔勋爵肯定知道
Lord Saltire would realize

642
00:36:07,928 --> 00:36:10,823
那样是不可能的
the impossibility of achieving such a goal.

643
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:15,770
即使是被那个德国人教唆
Even if abetted by this German,

644
00:36:15,847 --> 00:36:20,324
他可是个聪明实际的孩子
he is an intelligent and practical child.

645
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:23,223
但他睡觉时也会哭泣
And yet he cries in his sleep.

646
00:36:24,563 --> 00:36:27,366
公爵大人是自己寄的信吗
Did his Grace post the letter himself?

647
00:36:27,368 --> 00:36:29,836
公爵大人可没有寄信的习惯
His Grace is not in the habit of posting letters.

648
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:32,207
那封信和其他信件一起
The letter was laid with others

649
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,067
放在书桌上
upon the study table

650
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:35,115
是我亲自放在那儿的
and I, myself, put them there.

651
00:36:35,992 --> 00:36:38,277
除我以外能接触到它们的人
The only other person who would handle them

652
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:39,466
就只有瑞瓦兹了
would be Rivers,

653
00:36:39,752 --> 00:36:41,964
他送日报到学校门房
who delivers the Daily Post to the lodge.

654
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,881
你确定这封信跟它们在一起
And you're sure this letter was among them?

655
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:46,034
是的 我能肯定
Oh yes. I observed it.

656
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:50,113
你发现什么了 福尔摩斯先生
And what have you observed, Mr. Holmes?

657
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:53,183
你的调查有进展了吗
How does your investigation progress?

658
00:36:53,256 --> 00:36:55,926
你会让我失望吗
Are you to disappoint me?

659
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,388
我仍希望能带给您最大的希望
I hope still to render your greater happier

660
00:36:59,389 --> 00:37:01,376
并使我自己成为更富裕的人
and myself a richer man.

661
00:37:01,378 --> 00:37:03,479
你发现了什么?
And what have you discovered?

662
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:06,581
我澄清了一件事
It is mostly a matter of clarification.

663
00:37:06,654 --> 00:37:08,914
我相信那孩子是
My belief is that the boy was

664
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:10,808
被事先安排好的诱饵引出了学校
tempted out of the school by a prearrangement

665
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,975
而我怀疑 他的母亲
and I suspect that his mother

666
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:17,125
可能正是诱饵
may have been the bait.

667
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:20,443
德语教师发现了他的出逃
The German master observed his departure

668
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:22,168
出发去追
and set off in pursuit.

669
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,440
我们在荒原上费了一番周折
We tracked the passage of his bicycle

670
00:37:26,441 --> 00:37:29,687
追踪到了他的自行车踪迹
across the moors with much difficulty.

671
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:32,678
车胎印就好像
It is almost as if the tracks

672
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:36,149
被人有意擦拭过一样
were deliberately sponged by someone...

673
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:40,922
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

674
00:37:40,999 --> 00:37:42,730
有人驾着马车
Someone driving cattle.

675
00:37:42,807 --> 00:37:45,096
你不会碰巧知道荒原上的马车...
You don't happen to know if the cattle on the moor...

676
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:46,727
它们怎么了?
What about them?

677
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:49,028
我希望你没有看见
I hope you have seen none.

678
00:37:49,941 --> 00:37:51,941
在这种高地气候下
We cannot winter cattle outside

679
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:53,385
冬天我们是不驾车外出的
in our upland climate.

680
00:37:54,432 --> 00:37:55,902
在接下来的这两周里
They will not be out of the yard for,

681
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:58,324
它们是不会再外出的
oh at least another two weeks.

682
00:38:00,973 --> 00:38:05,801
那我还真是闭目塞听了
Then I've been as blind as the beetle.

683
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,860
谢谢你 公爵大人
I thank you, Grace.

684
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,262
旧蹄铁新掌钉 旧蹄铁新掌钉
Old shoes and new nails! Old shoes and new nails!

685
00:38:16,263 --> 00:38:17,895
福尔摩斯 你应该来看看这个
Holmes there's something you should see!

686
00:38:17,897 --> 00:38:21,021
一头牛如此行走奔跑可不寻常
It is a remarkable cow which walks, canters, and gallops.

687
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:22,639
看到这些马蹄铁了吗
Do you see those horseshoes?

688
00:38:22,641 --> 00:38:23,033
看到了
I saw them.

689
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:25,347
带走霍尔德芮斯勋爵的人
Whoever took Lord Holdernesse

690
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:27,547
给他的马钉了不同的马蹄铁
Shoed their horses with different horseshoes.

691
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,896
以避免被人发现
To escape detection.

692
00:38:30,967 --> 00:38:34,071
卢宾・黑斯是利用了
Reuben Hayes took advantage of

693
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:36,187
当地的历史
a piece of local history?

694
00:38:44,086 --> 00:38:47,297
太糟了 华生 太糟了
It's bad Watson, bad.

695
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:53,446
北边的秃鹰为我们指明了犯罪现场
Those vultures of the north mark the spot.

696
00:39:08,515 --> 00:39:11,184
德语教师
German master.

697
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:18,006
从尸体上能看出些什么?
What's left of him?

698
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:30,211
你好
Hello!

699
00:39:32,091 --> 00:39:33,599
你好
Hello!

700
00:39:35,225 --> 00:39:36,530
你好
Hello!

701
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:40,609
你好
Hello, hello!

702
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,641
血肉模糊
Skin and blood.

703
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,980
用显微镜才能知道是不是人干的
Only a microscope would tell if it's human.

704
00:39:52,981 --> 00:39:55,233
肯定与黑斯脖子上的抓痕相吻合
A consistent no doubt to the scratch on Hayes' neck.

705
00:39:55,235 --> 00:39:56,374
是的
Oh yes.

706
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,260
死因呢
Cause of death?

707
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,497
勒杀
Strangulation.

708
00:39:58,726 --> 00:40:00,220
喉头被重压
The larynx is quite crushed.

709
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,593
那个牧羊人
That shepherd can be

710
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:03,125
可以帮我们将这噩耗
our messenger to the priory school

711
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:05,034
传到修道院公学
with the news of this tragedy.

712
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,593
我们得靠走的了 华生
We must proceed on foot, Watson.

713
00:40:07,604 --> 00:40:09,478
我曾很暖和
I was warm!

714
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:10,949
在那小旅馆里
At that Inn,

715
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:14,091
就像孩子们说的 很暖
warm as the children say.

716
00:40:14,915 --> 00:40:16,293
我越是远离小路
The trail grows colder

717
00:40:16,295 --> 00:40:19,318
我就越是寒冷
every step I take away from it.

718
00:40:23,642 --> 00:40:26,421
我怎么知道把尸体放到哪里
How was I supposed to know where to put the body.

719
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,076
现在都结束了 阿瑟
It's all over now, Arthur.

720
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:49,160
卢宾・黑斯
Reuben Hayes.

721
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:51,497
但愿我们还不算太晚
Let's hope we're not too late.

722
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:57,033
邓洛普牌的外部加厚的车胎
A Dunlop with a patch on the outer cover.

723
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,412
这儿发生什么了 黑斯夫人
What happened here Mrs. Hayes?

724
00:41:11,422 --> 00:41:12,362
我很高兴
I'm satisfied that you

725
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,894
你并不赞同对这桩买卖
have no liking for this business

726
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:15,913
并在他们的威逼下进行了反抗
and that you acted under coercion.

727
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:19,484
有人带走了那孩子
Someone came for the boy.

728
00:41:22,284 --> 00:41:24,881
是公爵的秘书 瓦尔德先生吗?
The Duke's secretary, Mr. Wilder?

729
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:33,588
他们朝哪走了?
Which way did they go?

730
00:41:33,982 --> 00:41:34,717
是穿过荒原跑了吗?
Across the moor?

731
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:37,276
沿着彻斯特菲尔德路
It's aboard the Chesterfield Road

732
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:39,674
往他的小别墅跑去了
where be his cottage.

733
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:41,515
谢谢 黑斯夫人
Excellent Mrs. Hayes.

734
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:46,003
我必须得去警告公爵 华生
I must alert the Duke's household, Watson.

735
00:41:46,725 --> 00:41:50,580
你现在是那孩子的守护天使
You are now the boy's guardian angel.

736
00:42:39,576 --> 00:42:42,335
我想公爵大人的支票簿就在桌子底下吧
I fancy I see your Grace's checkbook upon your desk.

737
00:42:43,231 --> 00:42:44,506
我将很高兴看到您写一张
I would be glad if you would make me out a check

738
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,469
金额为6000磅的支票给我
for six thousand pounds.

739
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,672
最好您再背签下
Perhaps it would be best if you were to cross it.

740
00:42:48,684 --> 00:42:50,508
我的代理银行是城乡银行
The Capital and Counties Bank,

741
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:52,594
牛津街支行
Oxford Street branch, are my agents.

742
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:54,282
福尔摩斯先生
I do not possess a temperament,

743
00:42:54,283 --> 00:42:55,812
我可没有这种闲情
Mr. Holmes that appreciates

744
00:42:55,813 --> 00:42:57,201
来欣赏将您那所谓的
the kind of acidulous pleasantry

745
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:59,076
尖酸的幽默
that clearly amuses you.

746
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:01,790
抱歉 但我可看不出来
I am sorry, but I do not see how

747
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:04,089
詹姆斯 就是瓦尔德先生
James, Mr. Wilder

748
00:43:04,091 --> 00:43:05,917
会牵涉到这件事中
could possibly be implicated in this business

749
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,549
而且您也没有证据
and you average not proof of it.

750
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,865
不 我有证据
But I possess the proof.

751
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:10,182
这是毋庸置疑的
It is beyond debate.

752
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,848
你窗扉上的马蹄铁
The mud is scarcely dry on the

753
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:14,445
泥引还没全干呢
cloven horseshoes in your casements.

754
00:43:14,447 --> 00:43:16,463
你为什么不相信我的话?
Why do you doubt my word?

755
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,722
你似乎对一切都闭目塞听
You seem to suffer from a blindness.

756
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:22,472
你这种做法会带你走向疯狂
Your own interest, which borders on madness.

757
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,952
公爵大人
Your Grace,

758
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,739
大厅里的画像
those portraits in the hall

759
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:30,993
是年轻时的你和你父亲
of you and your father as young men,

760
00:43:33,158 --> 00:43:36,741
你的家庭秘密已经无法掩盖了
there your family liniments are very clear.

761
00:43:36,813 --> 00:43:38,262
瓦尔德先生
How long has Mr. Wilder

762
00:43:38,263 --> 00:43:39,424
为你效力已经多久了
been in your service?

763
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:41,616
你什么意思
What is your meaning?

764
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,437
你怎么敢 先生!
How dare you sir!

765
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:46,318
你根本不明白
You do not understand!

766
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,989
你是个无礼的人
You are a barbarian!

767
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,703
你永远不会...请立刻离开
You will never... please leave me immediately.

768
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:53,966
我不会...我
I won't...I...

769
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:04,633
如我所料
Then it is as I suspected

770
00:44:11,177 --> 00:44:13,334
詹姆斯・瓦尔德先生是你的儿子
Mr. James Wilder is your son.

771
00:44:24,651 --> 00:44:28,274
当我还年轻的时候 福尔摩斯先生
When I was a very young man, Mr. Holmes,

772
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:31,321
我也曾爱过
I loved,

773
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:34,760
爱之深
with such a love

774
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:37,573
一生唯有一次
that comes only once in a lifetime.

775
00:44:40,736 --> 00:44:42,955
我想跟她结婚
I offered the lady marriage

776
00:44:45,018 --> 00:44:46,375
但她拒绝了
but she refused it

777
00:44:46,377 --> 00:44:48,602
因为那样的结合
on the grounds that such a match

778
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:52,382
可能会毁了我的事业
might mar my career.

779
00:44:55,672 --> 00:44:56,403
如果她还活着
Had she lived,

780
00:44:56,404 --> 00:44:59,546
我绝对不会跟别人结婚的
I would certainly never had married anyone else

781
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:04,058
但她死了
but she died

782
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:08,048
只留下一个孩子
and left with one child,

783
00:45:09,877 --> 00:45:12,811
就是詹姆斯 因为对她的爱
James, whom for her sake

784
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:15,387
我抚养和培育这个孩子
I have tended and cared for.

785
00:45:17,554 --> 00:45:21,094
我不能向世人承认我们的父子关系
I could not acknowledge paternity to the world

786
00:45:21,095 --> 00:45:21,931
但除此之外
but in all other ways

787
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:24,632
我一直以亲生儿子待他
I have treated him like my son.

788
00:45:28,364 --> 00:45:29,479
他要求过
He has required,

789
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,509
但他不断辜负了
but not warranted,

790
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:35,341
我对他的原谅
a father's forgiveness many times

791
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,663
对此我也原谅他了
and I have forgiven.

792
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,382
我原谅他
I have forgiven.

793
00:45:45,702 --> 00:45:46,886
我一再原谅他
I have forgiven much.

794
00:45:50,455 --> 00:45:52,282
公爵大人 对瓦尔德先生来说
Awe your Grace you have done all you can

795
00:45:52,284 --> 00:45:53,431
您已经尽力了
for Mr. Wilder.

796
00:45:55,207 --> 00:45:57,400
你必须意识到你已经失去他了
You must realize that he is lost to you.

797
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:01,712
他蓄谋绑架萨特尔勋爵
He's conspired to abduct Lord Saltire.

798
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:03,059
他是一起谋杀案的帮凶
He's an accessory to a murder,

799
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,027
不管他是否知情
however unwittingly.

800
00:46:05,339 --> 00:46:07,062
在他犯下一桩
He must be found

801
00:46:08,994 --> 00:46:11,009
更严重的案子前 我们必须找到他
before he's attempted to a crime even more terrible.

802
00:46:13,694 --> 00:46:14,989
在你失去
He must be found

803
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,019
你倾力照顾的儿子之前
before you loose the son

804
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:19,280
我们必须找到他
that is left to you.

805
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:36,936
瑞瓦兹?
Rivers?

806
00:46:38,135 --> 00:46:39,910
你负责搜查荒原
You are to organize a search of the moor.

807
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:41,373
沿着西边的森林
West Woods in a line 

808
00:46:41,374 --> 00:46:42,783
从寺庙到凉亭一路搜查
from the temple to the pavilion.

809
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:46,000
要让你的人
You are to employ the entire staff

810
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,036
全部出动
without exception.

811
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:52,739
你要找的是我的儿子 萨特尔勋爵
You are looking for my son, Lord Saltire.

812
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,144
如果你找到了瓦尔德先生
If you find Mr. Wilder,

813
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:00,952
请务必扣留他
please see that he is detained

814
00:47:02,942 --> 00:47:03,872
并将他带给我
and brought to me.

815
00:47:15,528 --> 00:47:17,418
瓦尔德截下了你的信
Wilder intercepted your letter

816
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:18,889
并在里面塞了一张纸条
and substituted a note,

817
00:47:18,974 --> 00:47:20,985
由此诱导你儿子相信
which deceived your son into believing

818
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:22,170
他要见到他母亲了
that he was to see his mother.

819
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:25,757
凶狠的黑斯就是他的雇佣帮凶
The murderous Hayes was his paid accomplice

820
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:27,292
但警察都已被告知
but the police have been alerted.

821
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:28,679
黑斯跑不了的
Hayes will not escape.

822
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:29,822
华生?
Watson?

823
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,379
我把他们引到荒原上了
I tracked them over to the moor

824
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:35,007
可他们不见了
but they disappeared.

825
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:37,104
我把附近都搜过了
I searched the area

826
00:47:37,176 --> 00:47:40,854
但他们就像用了遁地术凭空消失了
but it's as if the earth just swallowed them up.

827
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:42,631
根据我对你家世的调查
With my research into your family history

828
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,175
我似乎听到过
I've seemed to recall mention

829
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:48,024
有一个巨大的石灰石洞穴
of a huge limestone cavern

830
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:51,471
那里关着偷来的牛
where the stolen cattle were penned.

831
00:47:51,548 --> 00:47:53,529
去大教堂
The cathedral.

832
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,977
快点
Come on.

833
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:02,081
快点
Come on!

834
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:47,796
把他交过来
Hand him over?

835
00:49:47,876 --> 00:49:48,944
不 
No!

836
00:49:49,025 --> 00:49:52,120
你得不到他
You shall not have him!

837
00:49:52,191 --> 00:49:54,408
父亲
Father!

838
00:49:54,488 --> 00:49:55,590
父亲 过来
Come Father!

839
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:57,959
父亲
Father!

840
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:01,334
父亲
Father!

841
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:03,630
詹姆斯
James!

842
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:34,148
我打算好好去爱弗朗西丝卡
I was disposed to love Francesca

843
00:50:34,227 --> 00:50:36,553
不再是少年的激情
and not with a boy's passion

844
00:50:36,628 --> 00:50:40,377
而是男人的真爱
but with a man's love.

845
00:50:43,031 --> 00:50:44,869
我与她的婚姻
My marriage to her

846
00:50:44,945 --> 00:50:49,773
被詹姆斯所嫉妒
founded on James' jealousy.

847
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:56,353
只要我还能在他身上
As long as I could see

848
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,618
看到他母亲的容貌和风度
his mother's face and manner in him

849
00:50:59,698 --> 00:51:01,774
詹姆斯就知道他能阻挡
James knew he could keep me

850
00:51:01,856 --> 00:51:06,755
我本该给我妻子的爱
from the love I owed my wife.

851
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:14,590
就算他对阿瑟很残暴
Even his cruelty to Arthur

852
00:51:14,662 --> 00:51:18,552
我还是无法就这样放弃他
I could not send him away even for that.

853
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:23,150
所以我就把阿瑟送走了
So I sent Arthur away instead.

854
00:51:23,223 --> 00:51:24,882
通过绑架他的弟弟
What did he hope to achieve

855
00:51:24,961 --> 00:51:27,358
他想达到什么目的呢
by kidnapping his brother?

856
00:51:27,433 --> 00:51:29,415
钱吗?
Money?

857
00:51:31,295 --> 00:51:33,584
还是身份?
Legitimacy?

858
00:51:33,663 --> 00:51:36,022
还有权力
And power.

859
00:51:36,098 --> 00:51:39,254
在我之上的权力
Power over me.

860
00:51:39,334 --> 00:51:44,577
他喜欢对我发号施令
He delighted in exercising power over me,

861
00:51:44,657 --> 00:51:49,665
因为我们都否定他的权力
for me and you were to have denied him power.

862
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:53,177
你是否怀疑他就是绑架事件的幕后黑手?
But you suspected that he was behind the abduction?

863
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:57,809
是的 那是我最黑暗的时刻
In my darkest moments, yes.

864
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:03,161
但我仍希望能
Yet somehow I hoped to

865
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,167
救他
save him.

866
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:13,672
这看起来就像是漫长的忏悔
Well, a long penance it had seemed.

867
00:52:13,748 --> 00:52:16,145
我只能希望
I can only hope that

868
00:52:16,219 --> 00:52:21,261
弗朗西斯卡能原谅我
Francesca will forgive me.

869
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:37,444
谢谢你 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

870
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,163
公爵大人?
Your Grace?

871
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:48,232
这是巨额酬金
This is a king's ransom.

872
00:52:48,303 --> 00:52:56,150
你又为我带回了未来
You have given me back my future.

873
