对你而言 天气也许不好
Unkind for you perhaps

15
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,163
但对我们英国人来说 你知道的
but we British, you know,

我有Moore和Ogelby的作品

这里很不错
It's very nice.

28
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:27,639
华生  我们必须认为
I suppose Watson we must look upon you

29
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,960
你是一名作家
as a man of letters.

30
00:03:30,036 --> 00:03:34,092
你怎么解释“怪诞”一词的
How do you define the word 'grotesque'?

31
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,144
怪诞
Grotesque.

32
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:39,162
奇怪-不同寻常
Strange-remarkable.

33
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:40,569
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

34
00:03:40,607 --> 00:03:43,700
肯定不只是那样
Surely there's more to it than that.

35
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:45,888
还有一些潜在含义
Some underlying suggestion

36
00:03:45,968 --> 00:03:49,208
比如悲惨或者恐怖的事情
of a tragic or terrible.

37
00:03:49,285 --> 00:03:51,056
如果你回想一下那些事件
If you cast your mind back to those narratives

38
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,725
你那些长期折磨
with which you've inflicted

39
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,576
公众的文章
a long-suffering public,

40
00:03:54,652 --> 00:04:00,013
你会发现“怪诞”一词如此频繁地
you will see how often the word 'grotesque'

41
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:03,129
同犯罪结合在一起
has deepened into the criminal.

42
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:09,238
我想
I suppose

43
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,567
红发会事件
the affair of the redheaded men

44
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:14,229
开头相当怪诞
was grotesque enough at the outset.

45
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,506
五个桔核事件
Most grotesque affair

46
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:21,036
一直很怪诞
of the five orange pips.

47
00:04:21,073 --> 00:04:22,640
是的 那直接引出一宗谋杀案
Yes, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy.

48
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:26,949
现在这个词...让我警惕
Now the word puts me on the alert.

49
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,796
电报里有这个词么
Have you it there?

50
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:33,792
我遇到一件难以置信
I've just had the most incredible

51
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,558
和怪诞之事
and grotesque experience.

52
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:40,528
我可以向您求教么 Scott Eccles
May I consult you Scott Eccles?

53
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,051
查林十字街邮局
Post-Office, Charring Cross.

54
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,276
男的还是女的
A man or woman?

55
00:04:45,354 --> 00:04:47,370
男的
A man.

56
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:49,757
女人不会发这种预付了回电费的电报
No woman would send a reply-paid telegram.

57
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:52,455
她会直接上门来的
She would have come.

58
00:04:52,533 --> 00:04:54,818
你要见他么
Will you see him?

59
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:58,376
哦 我亲爱的华生
Oh my dear Watson,

60
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:04,392
你知道自从我们关押了 卡鲁塞斯上校之后
you know how bored I've been

61
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:07,845
我有多无聊么
since we locked up Colonel Carruthers.

62
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:13,688
生活平淡
Life is commonplace

63
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:16,153
报纸枯燥无味
the newspapers are sterile

64
00:05:16,226 --> 00:05:18,918
冒险和罗曼史似乎从这个罪恶的世上
audacity and romance seem to have passed forever

65
00:05:18,995 --> 00:05:20,732
永远消失了
from the criminal world.

66
00:05:20,806 --> 00:05:22,717
我当然要见他
Of course I'll see him.

67
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,759
如果我没弄错的话 这位就是我们的委托人
Unless I'm very much mistaken, this is our client.

68
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,490
福尔摩斯先生么?
Mr. Holmes?

69
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:28,275
谢谢你 Hudson太太
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

70
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:29,680
-您是福尔摩斯先生么? -是的
Well are you Mr. Holmes? --Certainly.

71
00:05:29,717 --> 00:05:30,319
是的 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, Mr. Holmes,

72
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:32,074
我遇到了一件极奇怪
I have just had a most singular

73
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,817
极不愉快的事
and unpleasant experience.

74
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:37,233
我有生以来还从未有过这样的遭遇
No way in my life have I been subject to...

75
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,992
真是奇耻大辱
to such embarrassment

76
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,086
难以容忍
and been placed in such a position.

77
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,479
请坐 Scott Eccles先生
Please sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,052
这位是我的朋友和同事 华生医生
my friend and colleague Doctor Watson.

79
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:45,522
首先 请问
In the first place, my I ask,

80
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:47,703
你为什么要来找我
why you have came to me at all?

81
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,657
嗯 先生 这件事看来
Well, sir, it didn't appear

82
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:51,500
和警察无关
to be a matter which concerned the police,

83
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:53,305
但是 等你听完这件事
yet,when you've heard the facts,

84
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:54,380
你肯定同意
you must admit

85
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,076
我不能就这么算了
I couldn't just leave it where it was.

86
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:57,987
而对于私家侦探
Now the private detectives

87
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,828
你们这一类人呢
they are a class with whom I'm absolutely,

88
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:01,162
我不是很感兴趣
I have no sympathy.

89
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,475
坐下 Scott Eccles先生
Sit, Mr. Scott Eccles.

90
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,742
虽然如此
Nonetheless,

91
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,766
我久仰您的大名
having heard your name...

92
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:14,903
-华生 -我决定...
-Watson! -I decided...

93
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:16,639
其次
Now in the second place,

94
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,527
为什么你不立刻就来?
why did you not come to me at once?

95
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:19,673
什么意思
What do you mean?

96
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,849
现在已经2点15分了
Well it is now a quarter-past two.

97
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:25,315
你的电报是1点发的
Your telegram was dispatched about one.

98
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,546
瞧您这身装扮
No one could glance at your toilet and attire

99
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,362
就会知道您是在
without seeing that your disturbance dates

100
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,457
起床的时候遇上麻烦的
from the moment of your waking.

101
00:06:34,483 --> 00:06:36,219
是这样的 福尔摩斯先生
But you're right, Mr. Holmes.

102
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,126
我从没想过要梳洗一下
Yet I never gave a thought to my toilet.

103
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:43,909
我是如此急于逃离那座房子
I was only too glad to get out of such a house.

104
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,271
哦 不用了 谢谢你
Oh no, no thank you.

105
00:06:46,345 --> 00:06:48,968
你看 在我来这之前
You see but I have been running round

106
00:06:49,047 --> 00:06:52,325
我四处打听情况
making inquiries before I came here.

107
00:06:52,362 --> 00:06:55,022
我打电话给房屋管理处 你知道的  是的
I called the house agents, you know, oh yes,

108
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:57,214
是的 但他们说... 他们说
yes, and they said... they said

109
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:01,050
Garcia先生的房租已经付过了
that Mr. Garcia's rent was paid up all right

110
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,779
还说威斯特里亚寓所里一切正常
and that everything was in order in Wisteria Lodge.

111
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,892
冷静 冷静  Eccles先生
Then they you'll come, come, sir Eccles.

112
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:08,399
你和我的朋友华生一样
You know you're like my friend, Watson,

113
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:10,106
都有个坏习惯 叙述事情
who has the bad habit of telling his stories

114
00:07:10,175 --> 00:07:10,877
老是头尾颠倒
wrong end foremost.

115
00:07:10,914 --> 00:07:14,612
现在 请你...请你 整理一下思路
Now please, please arrange your thoughts

116
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,867
按顺序告诉我
and let me know, in their due sequence,

117
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:20,185
到底发生了什么事
exactly what those events are,

118
00:07:20,261 --> 00:07:22,510
什么事让你就这样跑出来
which have sent you out

119
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:24,322
头也不梳脸也不刮
unbrushed and unkempt,

120
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,534
靴子和背心的口子也没扣好
with your dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry,

121
00:07:27,612 --> 00:07:31,400
就这样来寻求建议和帮助
in search of advice and assistance.

122
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:34,750
我是一个单身汉
Well I'm a bachelor

123
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:38,543
由于喜欢社交
and being of a sociable turn

124
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:42,339
我结识了一大帮朋友
I cultivate a large number of friends.

125
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,681
在最近的一次聚会上
At the table of one of them recently,

126
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:46,609
我认识了一位名叫Garcia的年轻人
I met a young fellow named Garcia,

127
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,088
一个令人愉快的家伙
a pleasant chap

128
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:49,416
有西班牙血统
of Spanish decent,

129
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:52,500
和西班牙大使馆有些联系
connected in some way with the Embassy.

130
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,880
我们发现彼此对测绘地图有共同的兴趣爱好
We discovered a common interest in cartography

131
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:57,621
或者我是这么认为的
or so I thought.

132
00:07:57,698 --> 00:07:59,807
我们研究老地图
That's the study of old maps.

133
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:02,986
我们计划追寻五十年前
The plan was to retrace Surrey as Thomas Mould

134
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,454
Thomas Mould绘制地图的路线
engraved it some fifty years ago.

135
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:08,056
当我昨晚到达的时候
Well as soon as I arrived yesterday evening

136
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,001
我发觉那里的气氛
I knew something was wrong.

137
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,011
有些不对劲
The atmosphere of the place,

138
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,750
屋子里昏暗陈旧
the house was tumbledown,

139
00:08:14,826 --> 00:08:16,328
压抑的很
depressing.

140
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,498
Garcia告诉我说他有个很棒的厨子
Garcia told me he had a wonderful cook,

141
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:22,678
那人有一半西班牙血统 是他在旅途中认识的
a half breed he had picked up on his travels

142
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:24,459
但是那天的晚餐
but the dinner,

143
00:08:24,536 --> 00:08:26,203
如此糟糕
well it was so ill-prepared

144
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,016
服务很不周到
and served with such bad grace

145
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,410
饭菜难以下咽
that it was barely edible.

146
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:33,794
我向你保证那天晚上
I can assure you that there were many times

147
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,745
有好几次
in the course of the evening

148
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:38,745
我真想找个借口离开
I wished I could have invented some excuse to leave.

149
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:39,464
你说什么
What did you say?

150
00:08:39,502 --> 00:08:40,690
房间非常棒
Well the rooms is fascinating.

151
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:42,264
John Rogglbe
John Rogglbe.

152
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:43,565
那么很热门咯
Across the heat then?

153
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:47,593
不仅热门 伙计 可以说是风靡全郡
Wasn't just heat lad, it was all over the county.

154
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,334
你没有什么不舒服吧
I tell you, you feeling all right?

155
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,526
没有
Yes.

156
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:53,758
对不起
Sorry.

157
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:54,956
嘿  嘿
Please, Please.

158
00:08:54,994 --> 00:08:56,536
给客人再上点酒
Some more wine for our guest.

159
00:08:56,573 --> 00:08:58,188
好的
Yes.

160
00:09:01,356 --> 00:09:05,867
[西班牙文]
[Speaking Spanish]

161
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:25,246
还有客人要来么
Are we expecting company?

162
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,363
可以的话 我还想喝点那个
I would like a drink of that if it's possible.

163
00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:49,589
他没有对字条上的内容
And he made no remark

164
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,611
说些什么吗?
as to the contents of the note?

165
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:54,339
没有
None.

166
00:09:54,418 --> 00:09:56,189
但从那时起
But for that moment

167
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,850
他收起了谈话时的所有伪装
he gave up all pretence at conversation.

168
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,363
就坐在那儿
He just sat there

169
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,962
不停地抽着雪茄
smoking these endless cigarettes.

170
00:10:03,033 --> 00:10:06,075
大概11点的时候 我很高兴可以去睡觉了
About eleven I was glad to go to bed.

171
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,428
2小时以后
Two hours later

172
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,733
他来到我房间里
he looked in at my door.

173
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,029
你有摇铃叫我么
Did you ring?

174
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,393
我有摇铃么?
Did I ring?

175
00:10:12,469 --> 00:10:15,534
哦 别起来 现在快1点了
Awe, please don't wake up it's nearly one o'clock.

176
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,316
继续睡吧
Please go back to sleep.

177
00:10:17,393 --> 00:10:18,919
晚安
Good night.

178
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:22,073
接下来就到最关键的部分了
And now I come to the amazing part of my tale.

179
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:33,869
当我醒来的时候 天已经大亮了
When I woke it was broad daylight,

180
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,675
快9点了
nearly nine.

181
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,245
我特别交待他们 要在8点钟叫醒我
I had particularly asked to be called at eight,

182
00:10:38,315 --> 00:10:39,914
所以我很震惊
so I was very much astonished

183
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:41,648
怎能如此健忘
at this forgetfulness.

184
00:10:43,335 --> 00:10:45,312
我说有人在吗
I say is anybody here?

185
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:47,781
我想要点热水
I'd like some hot water.

186
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,485
我摇铃叫仆人
I rang for the servant.

187
00:10:49,564 --> 00:10:51,545
没有回应
There was no response.

188
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:53,689
有人吗
Somebody?

189
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:01,082
我说有人服务没
I say is there a servant available.

190
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,563
真该死
This is damnable.

191
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,372
我把房间挨个找了一遍
I went from room to room,

192
00:11:19,444 --> 00:11:21,693
都是空的
all were deserted.

193
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:23,329
主人房也一样
Even my host room,

194
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,520
床铺没人睡过
the bed had never been slept in.

195
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:26,855
外国主人
Foreign host,

196
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:28,224
外国仆人
foreign footman,

197
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:29,767
外国厨子
foreign cook,

198
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:32,296
在晚上全消失了
all vanished in the night.

199
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,893
您的经历
Your experience is,

200
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:35,476
就我看来
so far as I know,

201
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:37,284
非常奇特
perfectly unique.

202
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,973
还有什么别的情况么
Now what else can you tell me?

203
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:44,058
恩 我异常愤怒
Well, I was furious.

204
00:11:44,128 --> 00:11:46,482
我收拾了行李
I packed my bags

205
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:48,595
摔上大门
and I banged the front door behind me

206
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:51,262
出发去Esher了
and I set out for Esher.

207
00:11:51,342 --> 00:11:53,766
后来我给 Allan Brothers'地产经纪
Then I called at Allan Brothers',

208
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,712
打电话
the land agents,

209
00:11:55,786 --> 00:11:57,697
我发现这栋别墅
and found it was from them

210
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,018
是向他们租来的
that the villa had been rented.

211
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,143
租的?
Rented?

212
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,959
你看
Well you see

213
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,631
我不敢相信
I couldn't believe

214
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,073
他们消失了
that they had gone

215
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:08,907
就为了作弄我
simply to make a fool of me.

216
00:12:08,984 --> 00:12:11,815
我想他们肯定是想赖租金
I thought, you know, it must be the rent

217
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,244
但我错了
but I was wrong.

218
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,219
房屋经纪人感谢我的提醒
See the agent thanked me for my warning

219
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,541
并告诉我说租金已经预付了
but said that the rent had been paid in advance.

220
00:12:19,616 --> 00:12:21,795
我猜也许是大使馆付的
By the Spanish embassy I imagine?

221
00:12:21,872 --> 00:12:24,599
我给西班牙大使馆打电话
I called at the Spanish embassy.

222
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,134
他们不认识这些人
The man is unknown to them.

223
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,315
我也问了把他们介绍给我认识的朋友
I also asked my friend who introduced us

224
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,852
他和我一样不了解他们
and he seemed to know less about Garcia than I did.

225
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:35,374
现在 这座房子
Now, this house,

226
00:12:37,838 --> 00:12:40,845
威斯特里亚公寓
Wisteria Lodge,

227
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,582
我想它是否和你离开时一样
I wonder if it's still as you left it.

228
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,687
想什么呢 华生
What's troubling you, Watson?

229
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,949
厄
Huh?

230
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:50,578
恐怕等我们到那儿的时候
Well I fear some mundane explanation of the events

231
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:53,227
也许会发现原因其实很简单
may await us upon our arrival.

232
00:12:53,738 --> 00:12:54,349
有可能
It's possible.

233
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,404
感谢我们的好运气
We can thank our lucky fate,

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,434
把我们从百无聊赖中
which will rescue us for a few hours

235
00:12:58,002 --> 00:13:01,829
拯救出来几个小时
from the insufferable fatigues of idleness.

236
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:16,630
这位先生推荐村里的公牛旅馆
This gentleman recommends The Bull in the village,

237
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:19,297
我们可以在那里过夜
that's if we're to stay overnight.

238
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:26,009
我问他是否认识Garcia
I asked him if he knew Garcia

239
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,884
或者他的仆人
or his servants.

240
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,357
他认识么?
Did he?

241
00:13:29,428 --> 00:13:31,165
不认识
No.

242
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,249
外边没有什么特别的
Nothing unusual about the outside.

243
00:13:34,318 --> 00:13:37,698
让我们看里面的情况
Let's see what the interior holds for us.

244
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:39,100
我希望我们不会因非法侵入
I don't suppose we could be charged

245
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:41,188
而被起诉
with housebreaking can we?

246
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,147
怎么这么乱七八糟的 也不收拾
Who on earth could leave such a mess?

247
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,241
的确如此
Yes indeed.

248
00:14:03,548 --> 00:14:06,042
到屋子里四处看看 华生
Take a glance around the house, Watson.

249
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,981
福尔摩斯先生么?
Mr. Holmes?

250
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:24,807
欢迎您来威斯特里亚公寓 福尔摩斯先生
Welcome to Wisteria Lodge, Mr. Holmes.

251
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:28,158
我是Surrey 警队的Baynes警长

252

253
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:38,326

And you are Mr. John Scott Eccles

254
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,387

Scott Eccles先生
Mr. Scott Eccles

257
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:47,136
我们跟了您一个上午了
we've been following you about all the morning.

258
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:50,265
我想您是通过电报找到他的吧
You traced him through his telegram, I presume?

259
00:14:50,302 --> 00:14:53,285
没错 福尔摩斯先生
Exactly, Mr. Holmes.

260
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:57,080
我们在查林十字街邮局发现了他的踪迹
We picked up the scent at Charring Cross Post-Office.

261
00:14:57,156 --> 00:14:59,813
你想干什么
But what'd you want?

262
00:14:59,892 --> 00:15:01,522
为什么跟踪我
And why did you follow me?

263
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,363
我们想要您一份证词 Scott Eccles先生
We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles,

264
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:06,547
关于住在Esher附近
as to the events which led up to the death

265
00:15:06,627 --> 00:15:09,424
威斯特里亚寓所的

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,299

是的
Yes.

270
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,323
怎么死的
But how?

271
00:15:20,405 --> 00:15:21,323
意外么?
An accident?

272
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,350
谋杀 先生 如果世界上发生过谋杀的话
Murder, sir, if ever there was one on earth.

273
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:31,162
哦 上帝啊
Good God!

274
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:36,266
这太可怕了
This is awful!

275
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:38,796
您不会认为我是嫌疑犯吧
You don't mean that I'm suspected?

276
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:42,211
先生 我们在死者身上
Well, sir, you're note was found

277
00:15:42,285 --> 00:15:44,394
发现了您写的字条
on the dead man's body

278
00:15:44,474 --> 00:15:46,070
上面说
and from it we learned

279
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,258
你打算昨晚上
that you had planned to stay here

280
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:50,516
在这里过夜
in this house last night.

你在这过夜了 是么
Oh, you did, did you?

283
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,488
等一下
Wait.

284
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:58,931
Baynes 我想
Baynes, I mean surely

285
00:15:59,004 --> 00:16:01,463
你要的只是一份简单的证词吧
all you need is a simple statement.

286
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:04,365
是的 福尔摩斯先生 但是我有责任
Yes, Mr. Holmes, but it is my duty

287
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,481
提醒Scott Eccles先生
to warn Mr. Scott Eccles

288
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:12,609
这份证词将作为呈堂证供
that it may be used against him.

289
00:16:12,678 --> 00:16:15,307
这位是我的同伴 华生医生

-是的 当然 -医生 来一下
-Yes of course. -Doctor your attention.

292
00:16:21,568 --> 00:16:23,339
Scott Eccles 先生 您看上去
Mr. Scott Eccles you look as if

293
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:24,792
好像需要喝点酒吧
you could do with a drink.

294
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,335
我在书房发现了些白兰地 如果你想...
I found some brandy in the library if you think...

295
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,900
谢谢你
Thank you.

296
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,163
[西班牙文]
[Speaking Spanish]

297
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,473
我向您保证警长
Well I can assure you, Inspector that, you know,

298
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,365
我说的每个字都是真的
every word I've said it is the truth.

299
00:17:20,441 --> 00:17:23,961
我一定要说的是 Scott Eccles先生
I'm bound to say, Mr. Scott Eccles,

300
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:26,898
您说的每件事
that everything you've said

301
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,394
和我们注意到的事实
does agree with the facts

302
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,925
都完全一致
as they've come to our notice.

303
00:17:31,996 --> 00:17:36,881
比如说 晚餐时送来的字条
For example, the note that arrived during dinner.

304
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:39,412
Scott Eccles先生 这张字条后来怎么了
Mr. Scott Eccles what became of the note?

305
00:17:39,484 --> 00:17:41,080
Garcia 把它揉成一团
Well, Garcia rolled it up

306
00:17:41,158 --> 00:17:43,302
扔到火里去了
and threw it in the fire.

307
00:17:43,381 --> 00:17:45,455
对此你有什么要说的么  Baynes先生
What do you say to that, Baynes?

308
00:17:45,535 --> 00:17:48,028
这是个带栅栏的壁炉 福尔摩斯先生
It was a dog-grate, Mr. Holmes,

309
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:51,992
他扔过头了
he over pitched it.

310
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:56,950
我在炉子后面找到了 这张没有烧着的字条
I found this unburned of the back.

311
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,968
您一定把房子搜查得
You must have made a very careful

312
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,670
十分仔细
examination of the house

313
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,730
才能找到这么小的纸条
to find a single pellet of paper.

314
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,657
哦 是的 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, I did, Mr. Holmes, I did.

315
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,937
这正是我工作作风
It's my way.

316
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:13,628
字条是写在一张普通的乳黄色
The note is written on ordinary cream-laid paper

317
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:16,060
带水印的纸上
with a watermark.

318
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,207
它有四分之一张纸那么大
It's a quarter-sheet.

319
00:18:18,287 --> 00:18:21,352
用短刃剪刀 剪了两下
The paper's cut off in two snips

320
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,743
剪下来的
with a short-bladed scissors.

321
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:28,430
折叠两次后
It's been folded twice

322
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,786
用红色的蜡封口
and sealed with scarlet wax.

323
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,597
字条是送给
It's addressed to

324
00:18:33,672 --> 00:18:36,166
威斯特里亚公寓的Garcia先生
Mr. Garcia, Wisteria Lodge

325
00:18:36,236 --> 00:18:39,278
上面写着
and it says

326
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:43,508
"我们自己的颜色 绿和白"
Our own colors, green and white.

327
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:45,696
"绿色开"
Green open,

328
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:47,757
"白色关"
white shut.

329
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,598
"主楼梯"
Main stairs,

330
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,746
"第一个走廊"
first corridor,

331
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:54,589
"右边第七"
seventh right,

332
00:18:54,665 --> 00:18:57,462
"绿粗呢"
green baize.

333
00:18:57,535 --> 00:19:00,228
"祝成功"
Godspeed.

334
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,799
署名"D"
D.

335
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,745
是女人的笔迹
It's in a woman's writing,

336
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:08,571
笔头非常尖
done with a very sharp-pointed pen,

337
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,949
但是地址是用不同的笔写的
but the address is either done with a different pen

338
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,725
或者是别人写的
or by someone else

339
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,668
因为字迹更粗重
because it's thicker and bolder,

340
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:21,017
你看 福尔摩斯先生
as you may see, Mr. Holmes.

341
00:19:21,092 --> 00:19:23,678
这是一张不同寻常的字条
It's a remarkable note.

342
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,565
我必须得祝贺您
I really must congratulate you

343
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:27,749
注意到了细节
on your attention to detail.

344
00:19:27,827 --> 00:19:30,765
但是还要补充一些
There are a few trifling points

345
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,910
小细节
which might perhaps be added.

346
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,567
字条是用袖口封口的
The seal is a sleeve-link

347
00:19:36,648 --> 00:19:39,958
还会有其他什么东西是这样的形状呢
what else is of such a shape?

348
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:43,237
剪刀是弯头的指甲剪
The scissors were bent nail scissors.

349
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:45,155
虽然剪的两下都不长
Short as the two snips are,

350
00:19:45,229 --> 00:19:46,825
你还是能清楚地看到
you can distinctly see

351
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,293
每一刀都有一样略弯的曲线
the same slight curve in each.

352
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:59,275
我还以为已找到了全部线索了 福尔摩斯先生
I thought I had squeezed it dry, Mr. Holmes,

353
00:19:59,348 --> 00:20:03,987
但显然我还是漏掉了一些东西
but I see there was some still left over after all.

354
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,325
我得说
I'm bound to say

355
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,649
我并不太明白纸条的意思
that I make nothing of the note

356
00:20:11,725 --> 00:20:15,850
但我知道有人在搞名堂
except that there's something's on hand,

357
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,587
这件事照例
and a woman, as usual,

358
00:20:18,665 --> 00:20:20,914
还牵涉到一个女人
is at the bottom of it.

359
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,628
警长 我很高兴你找到了这张纸条
I'm very glad you found the note, Inspector,

360
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,682
因为它证明了我说的话
because it collaborates my story.

361
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:35,793
但是 你知道 我要说的是
But, you know, I do beg to point out

362
00:20:35,862 --> 00:20:37,225
我还不知道
that I haven't yet heard

363
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,314
Garcia先生发生了什么事
what has happened to Mr. Garcia,

364
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:42,356
或者他家里发生了什么事
or what has become of his household.

365
00:20:42,426 --> 00:20:46,109
Garcia先生么 很容易回答
As for Mr. Garcia, that's easily answered.

366
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:49,800
今天早上发现他死在
He was found dead

367
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:54,249
Oxshott公有地上
on Oxshott Common this morning.

368
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:59,475
他的脑袋被沙袋或类似的东西
His head had been beaten to a pulp by a sandbag

369
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:03,273
打成了肉酱
or some such object,

370
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,077
不仅是打破了 简直是稀巴烂
which had crushed rather than wounded.

371
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:08,543
很明显 他最初
Apparently he'd been

372
00:21:08,614 --> 00:21:11,073
是被人从后面袭击的
first struck down from behind,

373
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,907
但是凶手在他死后
but his assailant went on beating him

374
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:15,163
还打了很久
long after he was dead.

375
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,964
这是一次非常残暴的袭击
It was a very furious assault.

376
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,963
可以说是我们见过的
Awe, I mean this activity that we saw

377
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,447
最严重的一次行凶了
has to be approached at the highest.

378
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,643
发现脚印或其他犯罪线索了么
Were there any footsteps or clues as tothe criminal?

379
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,989
没有 还没有
No, no, as yet.

380
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,585
Garcia 被抢劫了么?
Had Garcia been robbed?

381
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,340
没有
No.

382
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:34,654
没有抢劫的迹象
No sign of robbery.

383
00:21:34,735 --> 00:21:36,312
我们的租户好像
Well our tenants seem to have left

384
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:38,490
什么东西也没有留下
little or nothing behind them.

385
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,638
除了衣服
Apart from the clothes,

386
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:42,523
几个烟斗 几本小说
some pipes, a few novels,

387
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:44,883
其中有两本是西班牙文的
two of them in Spanish.

388
00:22:19,932 --> 00:22:22,624
其中一把不见了
One of them is missing.

389
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:28,734
是的
Yeah.

390
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,502
可以认为'G'代表Garcia
We might assume the 'G' stands for Garcia.

391
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:36,230
也许是祖传的
Family heirloom perhaps.

392
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:38,861
另一把枪不在死者身上
The other was not on the body

393
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,981
在附近也没有找到
nor has it been found in the vicinity

394
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,007
但我的人还在寻找
though my men are still looking.

395
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:44,347
你想看看房子周围么
Do you wish to look around the house?

396
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,942
稍稍看一下
A brief look.

397
00:23:03,283 --> 00:23:04,879
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

398
00:23:06,394 --> 00:23:07,990
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

399
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,516
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

400
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:57,771
华生!
Watson!

401
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:58,634
看见什么了
What have you seen?

402
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:01,089
就像个魔鬼
Could have been the devil for all I know.

403
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:02,795
瞪着眼睛从窗外朝里看
Staring eyes at the window.

404
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,766
有黑人特征 像是黑白混血儿
Negroid features, mulatto like.

405
00:24:04,803 --> 00:24:06,832
穿过空地跑了
It's got away across the field.

406
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:07,557
也许这样也好
Maybe just as well

407
00:24:07,594 --> 00:24:09,409
我想我可能打不过他
I don't think I could have laid hands on him.

408
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,338
哦 看看这个
Awe, look at this.

409
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:15,896
如果他的身材和脚般配的话
If he is all the same scale as his foot

410
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,799
他一定是个巨人
then he is certainly a giant.

411
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,974
不管他是谁 他想干嘛
Well whoever he was, whatever he wanted

412
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:25,095
目前他逃走了
he's gone for the present,

413
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,847
我们要关心更重要的事
and we have more important things to attend to.

414
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,247
Downing 你留下
Downing, you stay here.

415
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:42,768
诸位请跟我到局里一趟
And you sir shall come to the station with me.

416
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:45,721
-好的 先生 -我要做份笔录
-Yes sir. -And let me have a written statement.

417
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:46,875
是的 我立刻就来
Yes certainly I'd come at once.

418
00:24:46,912 --> 00:24:47,576
我希望您不介意
I hope you don't my

419
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,019
我们一起合作 警长
collaborating with you Inspector.

420
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,972
我很荣幸 福尔摩斯先生
I'd be honored, Mr. Holmes.

421
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:52,615
荣幸之至
I'd be honored.

422
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,046
警长 有没有线索证明
Inspector, is there any clue

423
00:24:54,123 --> 00:24:55,824
那人准确的死亡时间么
as to the exact hour of the man's death?

424
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,461
一点钟
One o'clock.

425
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,136
那时候在下雨
It rained about that time

426
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:03,341
死亡肯定在下雨之前
and the death certainly occurred before the rain.

427
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:05,531
不 不 不
No. No, no.

428
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:08,884
那绝对不可能 Baynes先生
That's perfectly impossible, Mr. Baynes.

429
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,617
不 不 他的声音很特殊
No, no, his voice is very unmistakable.

430
00:25:11,695 --> 00:25:12,953
我发誓
I could swear to it

431
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,417
那个时候在我房间里和我说话的人
that it was he who addressed me in my room

432
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,365
就是他
at that very hour.

433
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,140
他和我说话 你知道
Well he spoke to me, you know,

434
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:20,615
他有那种可笑的口音
in that funny accent of his.

435
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,901
他说就要1点了
He said he's it's nearly one o'clock.

436
00:25:22,977 --> 00:25:25,879
很好 但是我们要分清不太可能
Remarkable but we must not confuse the unlikely

437
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:28,131
和绝不可能
with the impossible.

438
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,401
他什么意思
What does he mean of that?

439
00:25:32,482 --> 00:25:35,547
显然那房子里的人很古怪
Certainly some strange people occupy that house,

440
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:37,223
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

441
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,039
有一个已经死了
One of them is dead.

442
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:40,675
是他的同伴
Did some of his companions

443
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:42,492
跟着他然后杀了他么?
follow him and murder him?

444
00:25:42,567 --> 00:25:46,646
如果是这样的话 我们会在被监视的每个港口抓到他们
If so, we should have them for every port is watched

445
00:25:46,739 --> 00:25:50,083
但我不这么认为 福尔摩斯先生
but my views are different, Mr. Holmes.

446
00:25:50,158 --> 00:25:52,920
是的先生 我有不同的看法
Yes sir, my views are very different.

447
00:25:52,995 --> 00:25:54,555
你很有一套
You have a theory?

448
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,329
我要自己干 福尔摩斯先生
And I'll work it myself, Mr. Holmes.

449
00:25:57,405 --> 00:25:58,815
你已经名闻天下了
Your name is already made,

450
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,799
我还在努力中
I have yet to make mine

451
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,701
我将来会说
and I shall like to be able to say afterwards,

452
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:07,278
我没有依靠你的帮助 解决了这个案子
that I solved it without your help.

453
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:08,985
那么你走你的阳光道
Then you do follow your path

454
00:26:09,063 --> 00:26:09,708
我走我的独木桥
and I will follow mine.

455
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:10,916
再见 Scott Eccles先生
Goodbye, Mr. Scott Eccles.

456
00:26:10,953 --> 00:26:11,877
再见 福尔摩斯先生
Goodbye, Mr. Holmes.

457
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:13,487
Scott Eccles
Scott Eccles.

458
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:16,511
我们研究下字条吧
Let us consider this note.

459
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:18,181
这牵涉到一位女士么?
Is there a woman involved?

460
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,276
嫉妒的丈夫?
A jealous husband?

461
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,603
上帝保佑
Godspeed.

462
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,642
上帝保佑D  她会成为我们的引路人
Godspeed D, that must be our guide.

463
00:26:25,714 --> 00:26:27,077
这个男子是个西班牙人
The man was a Spaniard

464
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:31,076
我猜 'D'代表Delores
I suggest that the 'D' stands for Delores.

465
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:33,806
它是常用的西班牙妇女的名字
It's a common female name in Spain.

466
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,134
西班牙人之间会用西班牙文通信的
A Spaniard would write to a Spaniard in Spanish,

467
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:38,353
华生

Henderson庄园...High Gable... George Ffolliott
Henderson, High Gable, George Ffolliott.

472
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:07,457
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes?

473
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,078
看看我发现了什么
Look what I've found.

474
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,903
从灌木丛里
In the bush.

475
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,473
好极了

476
00:29:40,793 --> 00:29:42,156
非常抱歉
I'm terribly sorry.

477
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,271
我好像…
I've seemed to have...

478
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:53,016
[西班牙文]
[speaking Spanish]

479
00:29:54,408 --> 00:29:55,463
你侵入了我们的住所
You are trespassing.

480
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,151
非常抱歉 我迷路了
I'm terribly sorry. I've seemed to have lost my direction.

481
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:59,092
你们老是这么好奇…
Is it your custom to wonder...

482
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,102
啊 Rayfield医生
Awe, Doctor Rayfield,

483
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:04,730
我的朋友和制图伙伴
my friend and fellow cartographer.

484
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:06,081
是的
Yes indeed.

485
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:08,104
你那么认真地
You were so engrossed

486
00:30:08,178 --> 00:30:09,915
找寻一条通往
in trying to chase the bridal path

487
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:14,667
已消失的圣玛丽村的结婚路线
to a now vanished Hamlet of Obligor St Mary

488
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:16,003
因此我们分开了
that we mislaid each other.

489
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:18,555
由于来见Henderson先生有点晚了 我想
And since we're late for Mr. Henderson, I thought,

490
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,880
很高兴你找到这儿了
I'm so glad you found your way here.

491
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,606
我很抱歉
Well I very much regret that

492
00:30:21,643 --> 00:30:24,583
Henderson先生今天很忙不能见您
Mr. Henderson is too busy to see you today.

493
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,081
不 Lucas
No Lucas,

494
00:30:27,152 --> 00:30:29,437
我要见他们
I will see them.

495
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:01,913
先生们
Gentlemen.

496
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,741
我们拜访的目的是
The purpose of our visit

497
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,190
想咨询一下High Gable的历史
is to inquire into the history of High Gable,

498
00:31:18,265 --> 00:31:19,733
我们相信英国内战以来
which we believe has an

499
00:31:19,803 --> 00:31:22,052
这里有一段迷人
intriguing and blood fested past.

500
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:25,542
但充满血雨腥风的过去
Since the days of the English civil war.

501
00:31:25,615 --> 00:31:29,192
对此我一无所知
I would have no knowledge of that.

502
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:31,663
我只是个新近的侵略者
I'm only a recent invader.

503
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:39,150
但是书房里可能会有些过去的资料
But there are local records in the library.

504
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:41,435
这房子里没有发现
There are no records of any past

505
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:44,206
任何过去的纪录
found in this house.

506
00:31:50,402 --> 00:31:52,418
我明白了
I see.

507
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:59,490
那么我不再打扰你了
Then I will detain you no more.

508
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:01,639
日安
Good day.

509
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:15,621
我以为你去伦敦了
I thought you were in London.

510
00:32:15,702 --> 00:32:17,577
只是上午在那里
For the morning only.

511
00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:19,082
由于和往常一样
Well with your usual reluctance

512
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,751
你不愿意告诉我你的想法
to confide your thoughts to me

513
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,359
我分析了一下情况
I exercised my own mind in the matter.

514
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:25,607
你的名单上圈了两个名字
You'd circled two names on your list,

515
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:27,211
Henderson 和 High Gable
Henderson and High Gable.

516
00:32:27,291 --> 00:32:29,132
恩 其他的人
Well the others are,

517
00:32:29,205 --> 00:32:31,186
可以说 都是有名望的人
per say, respectable people.

518
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:33,167
和浪漫史沾不上边
Far aloof from romance

519
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:35,151
除了这位 Henderson
but this man, Henderson,

520
00:32:35,223 --> 00:32:37,880
是一位特别的人物
but he's a very singular creation.

521
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,484
的确如此
Yes indeed.

522
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:40,823
你也可能注意到了
As you may have noticed...

523
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:42,086
我不喝
no tea for me...

524
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:43,899
屋子有两翼
the house is double winged.

525
00:32:43,975 --> 00:32:47,145
一边住着仆人 另一边住着主人
One side the servants the other side the family.

526
00:32:47,223 --> 00:32:49,542
中间只有一扇连接的门
There is one single connecting door

527
00:32:49,616 --> 00:32:51,795
用来给Henderson家人上菜
for the Henderson family meals.

528
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,131
我相信在我们拜访的如此短暂的时间里
I'm sure you couldn't have observed all that

529
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:54,360
你不可能注意到这些的 福尔摩斯
in the short time we there, Holmes.

530
00:32:54,437 --> 00:32:56,208
我通过流言蜚语和被解雇的仆人
I was looking for evidence in gossip

531
00:32:56,283 --> 00:32:57,786
寻找证据
and discharged servants

532
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:59,523
我很幸运地找到一位
and I was lucky to enough to find one

533
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:00,752
他被专横的
who had been sacked

534
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,776
主人Henderson解雇了
by his imperious master Henderson

535
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,784
并且饱受他的暴虐之苦
and a victim of violent temper.

536
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,218
我们的Henderson小姐们
Now the Henderson girls,

537
00:33:07,292 --> 00:33:08,959
就是我们遇见过的那两位
who we encountered,

538
00:33:09,036 --> 00:33:11,051
有一位家庭教师
have a governess.

539
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,067
Burnet小姐 一位英国女士
A Miss Burnet, an English woman.

540
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:15,457
很奇怪的是
Here is the very singular fact.

541
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:16,929
谋杀案之后
She has not been seen

542
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:18,469
她再也没出现过
since the night of the murder.

543
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,970
她彻底消失了
She has utterly vanished.

544
00:33:20,008 --> 00:33:22,367
我见过她
I've seen her.

545
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:23,998
肯定是
Of course,

546
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:25,815
我见过她 她还活着
I've seen her and she is alive.

547
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:28,955
我看见她站在High Gable的窗户前
I saw her at the window at High Gable.

548
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:32,077
上帝啊 被囚禁了
My God a prisoner.

549
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,804
那可怕的女孩们袭击我的时候
She slipped my mind.

550
00:33:34,883 --> 00:33:38,426
我看见她了
The moment those awful girls descended upon me.

551
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,000
她还活着 我见到她了
She is alive, I've seen her.

552
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:48,616
那就是我看见和追过的那个男人
That's the man I saw and chased.

553
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,317
Baynes抓错人了
Baynes has arrested the wrong man.

554
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:53,654
华生 快点 我们必须阻止他
Now Watson, quickly, we must stop him.

555
00:34:07,737 --> 00:34:08,414
他是凶手么?
Is he the murderer?

556
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,367
他杀了西班牙人吗?
Did he kill a Spaniard?

557
00:34:10,437 --> 00:34:13,607
你们在哪里抓到他的
Where did you capture him?

558
00:34:13,686 --> 00:34:16,727
这人是受害者的厨子
This man is the murdered man's cook

559
00:34:16,797 --> 00:34:18,708
他在案发当晚失踪了
who disappeared on the night of the crime.

560
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,482
我们相信房子里
We believe there were valuables

561
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,061
存有贵重物品
left in the house

562
00:34:22,131 --> 00:34:23,727
这就是引出了
and that there abstraction

563
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,436
作案动机
was the motive.

564
00:34:25,516 --> 00:34:27,018
有人看见他曾经
The man had been seen

565
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:28,521
出现在屋子周围
in the vicinity of the house once before.

566
00:34:28,593 --> 00:34:30,841
第二次
The second time,

567
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:35,521
抓牢他 Higgins
subdue him Higgins.

568
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:40,240
第二次 我们留守的人抓到他了
The second time we let a man escape for him

569
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:43,082
在把他送交地方官之前
we shall be applying for remand

570
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,441
我们要申请遣送
when the prisoner's brought before the magistrate.

571
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:46,948
目前就这些情况 先生们
That will be all for now, gentlemen.

572
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,487
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

573
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:49,816
是在路上吗
Was it on the way?

574
00:34:49,892 --> 00:34:51,220
你们在哪里抓到他的
Where did you capture him?

575
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:52,923
Baynes
Baynes?

576
00:34:53,003 --> 00:34:54,844
我不认为你走对路了
I am not convinced that you're on the right line.

577
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,687
福尔摩斯先生 不想你错的太离谱
Mr. Holmes doesn't want you to commit yourself too far

578
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,292
除非你有确凿把握
unless you're sure.

579
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,148
哦 你们真是好人
Oh, you're very kind gentlemen

580
00:35:03,225 --> 00:35:06,501
但我们有协议
but we did agree

581
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:09,885
各行其事 对么
to work on our own lines didn't we?

582
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,616
这就是我所做的
And that's what I'm doing.

583
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:17,031
欢迎你们来我的新闻发布会
You're welcome always to my news.

584
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:19,762
这家伙壮得像匹拉车的马
This fellow is as strong as a carthorse

585
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,751
和魔鬼一样凶猛
and fierce as the devil.

586
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:24,959
在被制服之前
He nearly bit off Constable Downing's thumb

587
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,868
他几乎咬掉了Downing警官的大拇指
before they managed to master him.

588
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,959
他几乎不会说英语
He speaks hardly any English

589
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:34,703
除了咕哝声 我们从他嘴里问不出什么
and we can get nothing out of him but grunts.

590
00:35:34,782 --> 00:35:38,022
你认为你有证据
And you think that you have evidence

591
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:40,719
证明他杀了他的雇主
that he murdered his late master?

592
00:35:40,798 --> 00:35:44,550
我没这么说 福尔摩斯先生
I didn't say so, Mr. Holmes.

593
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:48,718
我没这么说
I didn't say so.

594
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,100
我们都有自己的小窍门
We all have our own little ways.

595
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:55,563
你走你的阳光道
You will go yours

596
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,104
我走我的独木桥
and I will go mine.

597
00:35:57,175 --> 00:35:59,832
那就是协议
That was the agreement.

598
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,751
就这么办吧
So be it.

599
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:06,735
我想Baynes终究会摔个大跟头
I think Baynes is riding for the fall.

600
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:09,134
我同意你的观点
I would have to agree with you there.

601
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:31,323
你知道我们面临的困难 华生
You appreciate our difficulty, Watson.

602
00:36:31,398 --> 00:36:34,314
我们没有申请保释的理由
There's nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant.

603
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:36,416
在我们尊敬的警长
And with our worthy Inspector

604
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:38,018
把嫌犯抓到之后
making his arrests

605
00:36:38,098 --> 00:36:39,616
地方官只会认为
our theory would seem fantastic

606
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:41,052
我们的推理是荒谬的
if laid before the magistrate.

607
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:43,221
你还是认为那位女士有生命危险么
Yet you think the lady's in danger of her life?

608
00:36:43,294 --> 00:36:44,657
是的
Yes.

609
00:36:44,731 --> 00:36:46,361
我确信这一点 华生
I'm sure of it Watson,

610
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,141
我们得靠自己
therefore we must take

611
00:36:48,217 --> 00:36:51,866
来伸张正义了
the law into our own hands.

612
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:02,809
左边最上面
Top left bay.

613
00:37:02,885 --> 00:37:05,682
我们可以从外屋进去
We could reach it from that outhouse.

614
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:54,364
快来
Come.

615
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,401
他们往火车站去了
They're heading for the station.

616
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:11,470
我们跟着马车去伦敦
We'll follow the coach to London.

617
00:38:11,508 --> 00:38:12,663
好的
Right.

618
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,590
停下火车
Stop the train.

619
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:32,285
停下火车
Stop the train.

620
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,178
停下
Stop it.

621
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,314
为什么会这样 福尔摩斯先生
Why, Mr. Holmes,

622
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,750
你给了我所有我想要的证据
you have given me the very evidence I wanted.

623
00:40:01,787 --> 00:40:04,960
我们一开始是站在同一起跑线上的
We were both on the same scent from the start.

624
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:06,637
你也在追查Henderson么
Were you after Henderson too?

625
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:08,453
是这样的 你先到那里
Quite so well, you first

626
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:11,664
后来 华生医生
and then Doctor Watson here

627
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,653
爬过High Gable的树篱笆
came crawling through the under growth

628
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,228
也来了
at High Gable.

629
00:40:15,297 --> 00:40:17,791
那时候我正在一棵大树上观察你们呢
I was up a tree observing you both.

630
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:18,927
问题的关键是
It was just a question

631
00:40:18,964 --> 00:40:21,354
谁先拿到证据
of who got the evidence first.

632

你为什么要抓那个混血儿?

我相信这位自称Henderson的人

发觉自己受怀疑了

635
00:40:31,093 --> 00:40:32,795
他在认为自己仍处于危险中时
and he would make no move

636
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:34,911
是不会采取任何行动的
so long as he thought he was in danger

637
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,952
所以我故意抓错人
so I arrested the wrong man.

00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:18,336
残暴的统治长达12年之久

653
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,641
是不是圣佩德罗的绿白旗

爆发了反对这位暴君的起义

660
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:41,929
当人们冲进Murillo的宫殿的时候 发现已经人去楼空了
but it was an empty palace they stormed on Murillo,

661
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,769
他的秘书

00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:59,388
成为欧洲报纸常谈论的题材

668
00:41:59,426 --> 00:42:02,597
我们一年前发现了他
We discovered him a year ago.

669
00:42:03,574 --> 00:42:06,563
Burnet小姐
Miss Burnet?

670

你怎么会牵扯进来的 Burnet小姐

一位英国女士竟卷入这样一宗谋杀案

672
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,866
因为这世界上

673
00:42:14,902 --> 00:42:17,484
找不到另一种方式来伸张正义
by which justice can be gained.

674
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:24,107
多年前圣佩德罗血流成河的时候
What does the law of England care about

675
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:27,093
或在这个人用船偷运走我们的财富的时候
the rivers of blood shed so many years ago in San Pedro

676
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:31,019
英国法律起到了什么用呢

对于你们而言

不幸的是 Murillo觉得我丈夫对他不忠

685

并枪杀了他

我丈夫拒绝带我一起回国

后来这个魔鬼垮台了

691
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:34,201
他像你们说的那样逃走了
He escaped as you have described.

692
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:36,384
但是许多生命被他毁了

695
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:40,241
他们不会就此罢休的
would not let the matter rest.

696
00:43:40,241 --> 00:43:42,537
我们结成一个团体
We banded ourselves into a society,

697
00:43:42,537 --> 00:43:43,963
任务一天没完成

00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:32,664
法律程序才刚刚开始
but our legal work begins.

791
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:35,098
是的 福尔摩斯先生 是的
Exactly, Mr. Holmes, yes.

792
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:36,499
Garcia的死
Garcia's death

793
00:51:36,572 --> 00:51:38,203
若一个经验老到的律师
in the hands of a portable lawyer

794
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:41,113
会把谋杀说成正当防卫
could look like an act of self-defense.

795
00:51:41,187 --> 00:51:43,506
但我认为法律不至于这样吧
But I think better of the law than that.

796
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:44,979
正当防卫是一回事
Self-defense is one thing

797
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:46,998
但是冷血地怀着蓄意谋杀的目的
but to entice a man in cold-blood

798
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:48,664
去诱骗别人又是另一回事了
with the object of murdering him is another.

799
00:51:48,744 --> 00:51:51,132
不管那个人会给你造成什么危险
Whatever danger you fear from him.

800
00:51:51,205 --> 00:51:53,749
我想我们会看到正义得到伸张的
I think we shall justice done at the next

801
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,852
我想你把那个混血儿放了吧
I thought you had released the mulatto.

802
00:51:55,923 --> 00:51:57,905
是的先生 他又是个自由人了
Yes sir, he's a free man again.

803
00:51:57,974 --> 00:51:59,780
你的人跟着逃亡者上火车了么
And your man is with the fugitives on the train?

804
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:02,441
是的 先生 而且我已经给苏格兰场打电话了
He is, sir, yes, and I've wired Scotland Yard

805
00:52:02,522 --> 00:52:05,423
他们会派人在滑铁卢车站
to have their men at Waterloo Station

806
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:07,512
等着他们的
to receive them, yes.

807
00:52:07,581 --> 00:52:10,623
我必须要祝贺你 警长
You know I really must congratulate, Inspector.

808
00:52:10,692 --> 00:52:12,766
无意冒犯 允许我这么说 您的能力
Your powers, if I may so, without offense,

809
00:52:12,847 --> 00:52:14,956
比您的职场运气强
are superior to your opportunities.

810
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:17,727
没错 福尔摩斯先生
Your right, Mr. Holmes.

811
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:20,461
在我们蜗居的这个省份
In the province as we stagnate

812
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:24,945
这样一件案子会给人带来机会
a case like this gives a man a chance.

813
00:51:05,364 --> 00:51:43,524
