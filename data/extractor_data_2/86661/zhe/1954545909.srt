00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,013
打场猎?
Rough shooting?

8
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:32,204
或者再钓会鱼?
Perhaps a little fishing.

9
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,751
还有萨塞克斯郡最棒的厨师
And the best cook in the county of Sussex

10
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:36,900
你说是吗?
wouldn't you say?

11
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:38,641
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

12
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,601
还有雷金纳德・马斯格雷夫
And Reginald Musgrave.

13
00:03:41,678 --> 00:03:42,957
他是英国最古老的
Well he is a sign

14
00:03:43,035 --> 00:03:44,694
一个家族的后裔
of one of the oldest families in England.

15
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,399
他是我的大学同学
He was in the same college as myself.

16
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,031
在同学中
He was not generally popular

17
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,144
不太受欢迎
among the undergraduates

18
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,578
但我总认为
but he always seemed to me

19
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:52,111
他表现出的那种傲慢
that what was set down as pride,

20
00:03:52,183 --> 00:03:53,736
是为了掩饰他的
was really a cover for

21
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,249
天生羞怯的表现
extreme natural diffidence.

22
00:03:56,324 --> 00:03:57,853
每当我想起他那
Indeed I never think of his

23
00:03:57,924 --> 00:03:59,582
苍白 瘦削的脸
pale, lean face

24
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,394
以及头部的姿态
and the poise of his head

25
00:04:01,472 --> 00:04:04,696
脑海里总会浮现灰色的拱道
without associating him with gray archways,

26
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:06,128
直棂窗
mullioned windows

27
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:09,428
还有一堆封建古堡的颓垣败瓦
and all the venerable wreckage of a feudal keep.

28
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:11,346
既然你诸多不满
Well if you feel so uncharitable

29
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,437
为什么还要接受他的邀请?
why didn't you accept his invitation?

30
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:16,045
想逃离死气沉沉的气氛
To escape my lethargy

31
00:04:16,118 --> 00:04:17,884
还有你对打扫贝克街
and you're constant bullying

32
00:04:17,961 --> 00:04:19,728
那房子的孜孜不倦
to tidy our room in Baker Street.

33
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:22,094
没有孜孜不倦
Hardly constant.

34
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:25,195
我打算用整个周末
So I have decided to devote my weekend

35
00:04:25,268 --> 00:04:31,031
来整理我早期的案件
to the collating of some of my early works.

36
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,462
什么早期的案件?
What early works?

37
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,959
在我的传记作家
It was before my biographer

38
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:35,421
来颂扬我之前的案件
came to glorify me.

39
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,225
你是说你有早期案件的记录?
Do you mean you have records of your work?

40
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:38,928
不是都是成功的案子
Not all successes.

41
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,296

案件的详细记录
and his abominable wife

48
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:59,277
还有铝制拐杖案
and the singular affair of the aluminum crutch.

49
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,268
铝制拐杖?
Aluminum crutch?

50
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:07,913
那东西有点过分讲究
Now that was something a little recherché?

51
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:13,227
我希望我也有这些案子的笔记
I wish I had notes of these cases.

52
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:16,225
想得倒美
Yes my boy.

53
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:18,209
随房主参观
Well you may hold my interest for a few hours

古董历史长廊
while you potter with our host

55
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,358
也许能让我感兴趣个几个小时
through the antiquities of a by gone age.

56
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,947
房子能让你感兴趣吧?
Surely the house interests you?

57
00:05:28,024 --> 00:05:30,655
那房子冷极了 华生!
The house is freezing Watson!

58
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:33,761
那是历史

你上次拜访时
I remember you telling me

62

和一名男管家有许多

他叫布兰斯顿吗?

一名当起了管家的年轻教师

00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:55,009
他是不是...是不是会几国语言?

是的 还会弹奏几乎所有乐器

还在将你在大学时让人吃惊的

88
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:40,798
那套本事运用到现实生活中
with which you used to amaze us at college.

89
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,362
是的 我还是靠脑子为生
Yes, I'm still living by wits

90
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:45,102
女主人呢?
and how is the dear wife?

91
00:06:45,183 --> 00:06:48,444
我没结婚呢 福尔摩斯
I'm not married Holmes.

92
00:06:48,523 --> 00:06:51,438
明智
How wise.

93
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:54,847
窗户的年代可追朔至1596年

全国尚有人居住的最古老的庄园

00:06:58,472 --> 00:07:00,902
我知道北方也有姓马斯格雷夫的
I once knew some northern Musgrave's.

97
00:07:00,977 --> 00:07:03,549
他们的确来自北方
They did come from the north originally.

98
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:05,245
家族中的一支庶系分支
A cadet branch of the family

99
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,341
脱离了北方的马斯格雷夫家族

100
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:09,037
于十七世纪初来到了

in the early seventeenth century.

102

103
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,698
福尔摩斯?

再来点白兰地吗 先生?
More brandy sir?

105
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:13,154
不了 布兰斯顿
No, Brunton.

106
00:08:18,554 --> 00:08:20,284
这就是事情的经过 兰德尔
That's how the story goes, Randall,

107
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:21,891
我可以保证
and I can vouch for it.

108
00:08:21,962 --> 00:08:24,701
但是委任状在这
But the commission is over here,

109
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,376
由鲁珀特王子签发的
signed by Prince Rupert.

110
00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:30,269
从我的祖先拉夫・马斯格雷夫流传下来的

113
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,781
太让人吃惊了
Astonishing.

114
00:08:40,852 --> 00:08:44,149
这是那天穿的靴子
It's one of the boots worn that day.

115
00:08:44,227 --> 00:08:45,923
恕我无礼 先生
If I may be so bold sir.

116
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:47,553
嗯?
Huh?

117
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:49,402
这对靴子是他哥哥穿的
The boot was worn by his brother,

118
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,591
罗兰・马斯格雷夫先生
Sir Roland Musgrave.

119
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,275
实际上
That was indeed,

120
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,366
我的管家曾是一名教师
my butler was once a schoolmaster,

121
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,585
他的学识以及对我家族史的了解
I must bow to his scholarship over mine

122
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:05,367
都远在我之上
and matters of my own family's history.

123
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,726
不 不 不 不用了
No, no, no never mind

124
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:12,985
你可以离开了
you may leave us now.

125
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:19,035
对了 布兰斯顿
Yeah but Brunton

126
00:09:19,119 --> 00:09:20,921
瑞秋今晚去哪了?
where is Rachel tonight?

127
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:23,013
她发低烧
She has a slightest temperature.

128
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,337
我让她回房间了
I told her to go to her room.

129
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,793
晚安 先生们
Good night, gentlemen.

130
00:09:58,186 --> 00:10:01,446
福尔摩斯...福尔摩斯跟我说过
Holmes... Holmes has told me

131
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,264
布兰斯顿的奇思妙想
of Brunton's extraordinary idea.

132
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:05,802
我记得上一次拜访的时候
But I remember on my last visit

133
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,497
他花了几个小时
where he spent several hours

134
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:12,617
用法语给我讲述
explaining to me in French

135
00:10:12,692 --> 00:10:16,855
短笛的起源
the origins of the piccolo.

136
00:10:16,935 --> 00:10:19,674
他满足于这个职位如此之久
It is wonderful that he should be satisfied

137
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:24,344
实在太让人惊讶了
for so long with such a position

138
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,837
我想...
but I suppose...

139
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,642
我想他过得太安逸了
I suppose he's been comfortable

140
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:31,397
也就不思进取了
and lacked the energy to make a change.

141
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:33,872
的确如此
Oh yes, indeed.

142
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:36,272
赫尔斯通的男管家
The butler of Hurlstone.

143
00:10:36,348 --> 00:10:38,115
总让来访的宾客
It's always a thing that is remembered

144
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,957
印象深刻
by all who visit us.

145
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:42,845
亲爱的马斯格雷夫
Oh dear Musgrave,

146
00:10:42,922 --> 00:10:46,776
但是 这个完人有一个缺点
However, this paragon does have one fault,

147
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:49,425
有点唐璜(玩弄女性的荒淫贵族)的风格
a bit of a Don Juan.

148
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,157
在安静的乡村扮演这样的角色
Well it's not a difficult part to play

149
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:52,766
可没有难度
in quiet country district.

150
00:10:52,837 --> 00:10:54,425
他结婚的时候 尚算检点
When he was married he was all right,

151
00:10:54,506 --> 00:10:55,893
但成了鳏夫以后
but since he's become a widower

152
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,949
就麻烦不断了
we've had no end of trouble with him.

153
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,921
几个月前
I mean, a few months ago

154
00:10:59,014 --> 00:11:00,524
他终于有安定下来的希望了
we were in hopes he was about to settle down again.

155
00:11:00,937 --> 00:11:02,236
他和瑞秋・豪威尔订婚了
He became engaged to Rachel Howells,

156
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:03,890
我的第二任女仆
my second housemaid

157
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,275
但他把她抛弃了
but he has thrown her over.

158
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,109
和珍妮・特雷杰丽丝
Taken up with Janet Tregallis,

159
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,551
猎场看守人的女儿好上了
my gamekeeper's daughter.

160
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,763
瑞秋是个好女孩
Rachel is a very good girl,

161
00:11:10,822 --> 00:11:13,535
但她有着威尔士人的那种易激动的脾气
but she is of an excitable Welsh temperament.

162
00:11:13,954 --> 00:11:16,727
现在她像个鬼魂似的到处游荡
Now she wonders around like a black-eyed shadow,

163
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:21,774
害得上上下下都闷闷不乐
thoroughly unsettling the household.

164
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:24,067
瑞秋?
Rachel?

165
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:57,712
早上好 福尔摩斯
Good morning, Holmes,

166
00:11:57,786 --> 00:11:59,444
雷金纳德先生
Sir Reginald.

167
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:18,994
谢谢
Thank you.

168
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:26,581
布兰斯顿去哪了?
Where's Brunton this morning?

169
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,876
没事 没事
It's all right, it's all right.

170
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,342
没事
Nothing.

171
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,909
没事了
It's all right.

172
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,820
她要晕过去了 华生
The girl is fainting, Watson.

173
00:12:38,522 --> 00:12:40,739
年轻的女士
My dear young woman,

174
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,311
你不该干活
you should not be at work

175
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:44,007
而该待在床上
you should be in bed.

176
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,889
你可以请假 瑞秋
You may leave your duties, Rachel.

177
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,220
感觉好些了再回来
Come back when you're feeling stronger.

178
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:50,206
我很好 先生
I am strong enough, sir.

179
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,559
这由我说得算
I'll be the judge of that.

180
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:52,739
你得回房间
You must go to your room.

181
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,028
不
No.

182
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,351
躺下
Lie down.

183
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:56,982
回房的时候告诉布兰斯顿
And on your way tell Brunton

184
00:12:57,065 --> 00:12:59,424
我想见他
that I wish to see him.

185
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:02,000
管家走了
The butler is gone.

186
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,495
走了?
Gone?

187
00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:04,706
走去哪?
Gone where?

188
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:06,139
他走了
He's gone.

189
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,421
他现在不在房间
He's not in his room now.

190
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:09,444
没有人见到他
No one's seen him.

191
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,911
没错 没错 他走了
Oh, yes, yes, he's gone.

192
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,374
他走了
He's gone.

193
00:13:23,531 --> 00:13:24,781
没事了
It's all right.

194
00:13:27,213 --> 00:13:28,767
没事了
It's all right.

195
00:13:30,104 --> 00:13:31,798
轻轻地 轻点
Gently.Gentle.

196
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,152
放轻松 瑞秋
Gently Rachel.

197
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,099
没事了
It's all right.

198
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:41,892
放轻松 瑞秋 放轻松
Gently, Rachel, gently.

199
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,242
轻点
Gentle.

200
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:08,997
床没有睡过的痕迹
The bed's not been slept in.

201
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:10,628
你找过房子的其他地方么?
Have you searched the house?

202
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,954
从顶楼到地窖都找过了
From cellar to garret.

203
00:14:12,032 --> 00:14:13,524
那女孩说得没错 没有他的踪影
The girl's right there's no trace of him.

204
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:15,054
他走了
He's gone.

205
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:16,785
不知道他怎么出去的
Do not see how the man could have left.

206
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,499
窗户和门都锁着
I mean the windows and door are all fastened.

207
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,204
为什么一个人大半夜出走
What man goes away in the middle of the night

208
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:22,777
却什么都没带?
and leaves all his possessions behind?

209
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,688
没带钱 怀表?
And money, watch?

210
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,186
我已经让那女孩
Well I've given the girl

211
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,026
平复下来了
something to calm her down

212
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:29,525
而且自作主张
and I've taken the liberty

213
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,128
请了位本地护士
to sending for a local nurse.

214
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,665
她现在精神极度紧张
She's in a most unusual nervous state.

215
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,328
她绝对不适宜
And she should, on no account,

216
00:14:35,408 --> 00:14:36,937
独自呆着
be left alone for a while.

217
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:38,501
她就是和布兰斯顿订婚的女孩?
This is the girl who was engaged to Brunton?

218
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:40,305
瑞秋・豪威尔 是的 是的
Rachel Howells, yes, yes.

219
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:42,364
有着威尔士人脾气的女孩
Girl with a fine Welsh temper.

220
00:14:42,436 --> 00:14:43,989
华生
Oh Watson.

221
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,252
各位 我无意让如此琐碎的
Look gentlemen I had no intention of this

222
00:14:46,331 --> 00:14:47,884
家庭小事
small domestic incident

223
00:14:47,967 --> 00:14:49,697
破坏你们的周末
should ruin your weekend.

224
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,515
我提议依计划去打猎
I propose we continue our plans for a shoot

225
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:54,181
希望回来的时候
and we'll return hopefully

226
00:14:54,264 --> 00:14:56,729
能有答案
to some simple explanation.

227
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:26,327
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

228
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:32,909
干的好 华生
Well done, Watson.

229
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:46,926
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

230
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,389
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

231
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:50,230
正如我跟华生所说
As I was telling Watson,

232
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,489
昨晚发生了一些事情
something happened last night,

233
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,901
也许能为这件事提供点线索
which may throw some light on this matter.

234
00:15:55,976 --> 00:16:00,139
这么说很丢脸 但...
This is very embarrassing but I...

235
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:03,731
我需要你的建议
I find I need your advice.

236
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:07,381
晚饭后不明智地喝了杯咖啡
I couldn't sleep after foolishly taking

237
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:09,136
导致我睡不着
that cup of Coffee after dinner

238
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,553
大约两点的时候 我放弃了尝试
and about two o'clock I gave up the struggle.

239
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:14,137
去楼下图书馆
I came downstairs to fetch a novel I'm reading,

240
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,306
拿我在读的一本小说
which I'd left in the library.

241
00:16:15,552 --> 00:16:16,284
你能想象我有多惊讶
Well you can imagine my surprise

242
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:19,065
当我看到门开着
when I saw a glimmer of light

243
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,848
里面透出灯光
coming from the open door.

244
00:16:21,928 --> 00:16:23,944
我记得我们离开前
I'd remembered I had extinguished the lamp

245
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:27,110
已经熄了灯关了门
and closed the door when we retired.

246
00:16:27,181 --> 00:16:29,777
自然而然我就想到盗窃
Naturally my first thought was burglars.

247
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:12,573
这就是你回报我的信任的方式
So this is how you repay my trust,

248
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,503
窥探我的家族资料?
prying into my family documents?

249
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:19,355
明天马上离职
You will leave my service tomorrow.

250
00:17:56,691 --> 00:17:59,678
马斯格雷夫先生
Mr. Musgrave, sir,

251
00:17:59,752 --> 00:18:02,906
我不想带着耻辱离开
I can't be a disgrace.

252
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:06,496
我一直都为自己的地位自豪
I've always been proud about my station in life,

253
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:10,009
耻辱会让我生不如死
and disgrace would kill me.

254
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,408
如果你把我逼上绝路
My blood will be on your head sir,

255
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:16,338
你的手上就会沾满我的鲜血
it will indeed if you drive me to despair.

256
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:17,836
什么?
What?

257
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,332
如果我不能保住工作
If you cannot keep me after this,

258
00:18:19,406 --> 00:18:20,959
那看在上帝的份上
then for God sake

259
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,594
让我向你辞职
let me give you notice

260
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,170
在一个月内离开
and leave in a month

261
00:18:24,242 --> 00:18:25,771
当作是我自己的意愿
as of my own free will.

262
00:18:25,842 --> 00:18:27,430
一个月太长了
A month is too long.

263
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,836
我可以忍受 马斯格雷夫先生
I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave,

264
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:31,680
只要不是当着
but not to be cast out

265
00:18:31,757 --> 00:18:33,629
我认识的人面前被赶走
before all the folk I know so well.

266
00:18:33,705 --> 00:18:35,993
你不配这种照顾 布兰斯顿
You don't deserve consideration, Brunton.

267
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,746
你已经声名狼藉了
Your conduct has been infamous.

268
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,705
然尔 我无意让你
However, I've no wish

269
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,799
当众受辱
to bring public disgrace upon you.

270
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,400
一个星期内自行离开
You take yourself away in a week,

271
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:47,894
无论你用什么理由
and you give whatever reason you like.

272
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,397
一个星期 先生?
A week, sir?

273
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:53,353
只有一个星期?
Only a week?

274
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,583
两周 起码两周
A fortnight-say at least a fortnight!

275
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:58,287
不 一个星期!
No a week!

276
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,993
你要意识到
And you may consider yourself

277
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,220
这已经是宽大处理了
to have been very leniently dealt with.

278
00:19:09,466 --> 00:19:10,995
奇怪之处在于
But what is strange

279
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,663
他似乎非常紧张能否久留
is that he seemed most anxious to stay.

280
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:15,796
之后的事情就显而易见了
Well it's quite plain to me what happened.

281
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,741
他回到房间
He went back to his room,

282
00:19:17,814 --> 00:19:19,473
深思熟虑
thought it over,

283
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:21,321
决定立刻消失
decided to stage his disappearance,

284
00:19:21,399 --> 00:19:23,236
非常明智
there and then cleverly.

285
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,600
也许在新女朋友的帮助下
Possibly with the help of his new woman friend.

286
00:19:25,677 --> 00:19:26,992
珍妮?
Janet?

287
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,420
不 不 不
No, no, no,

288
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:29,847
她和她父亲
She lives with her father

289
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,095
住在湖对岸
on the other side of the lake

290
00:19:31,174 --> 00:19:32,525
而且 我怀疑她是否有
and besides I doubt if she'd have

291
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,710
帮助他的本事
the wit to help him.

292
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:37,601
这张纸
This piece of paper

293
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,939
布兰斯顿认为值得
which Brunton thought worth his while to consult,

294
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:43,034
冒失去工作的危险一读
even at the risk of the losing his job?

295
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:44,599
什么都不是
Well it's nothing.

296
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,244
什么重要的信息也没有
It's nothing of any importance at all.

297
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:53,226
尽管如此
Nevertheless.

298
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,108
这只是份古老奇怪的礼典抄件
It's simply a copy of the singular old observance

299
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,368
叫做马斯格雷夫礼典
called the Musgrave Ritual.

300
00:20:02,447 --> 00:20:04,427
我的家族对此毫不陌生
Seldom peculiar to our family,

301
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,159
每个马斯格雷夫家族成员
which each Musgrave has to go through

302
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,510
成年时都需要接受
when he's coming of age.

303
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,742
是份奇怪的教义问答集
This is a strange catechism.

304
00:20:13,823 --> 00:20:17,332
没有日期 但却使用
Undated but written in the style

305
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,102
十七世纪中叶的风格拼写
of the middle of the seventeenth century.

306
00:20:19,181 --> 00:20:20,734
你和华生能
Would you and Watson be good enough

307
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:22,344
为我读一下吗?
to read it out to me?

308
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,634
医生 我已经烂熟于心了
Oh Doctor, I know it by heart.

309
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:29,642
它是谁的?
Whose was it?

310
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,488
那个离开的人
His who is gone.

311
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:33,581
谁应拥有它?
Who shall have it?

312
00:20:33,652 --> 00:20:35,039
那个将到来的人
He who will come.

313
00:20:35,114 --> 00:20:37,022
太阳于何处?
Where was the sun?

314
00:20:37,096 --> 00:20:38,340
橡树之上
Over the oak.

315
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,150
影子于何处?
Where was the shadow?

316
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:41,720
榆树之下
Under the elm.

317
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,495
如何测量?
How was it stepped?

318
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,864
向西八步乘八步
West eight by eight,

319
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,087
向南七步乘七步
south seven by seven,

320
00:20:49,168 --> 00:20:51,183
向西六步乘六步
west six by six,

321
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,002
向南五步乘五步 两步乘两步
south five by five and two by two,

322
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,133
于此下方
and so under.

323
00:20:57,204 --> 00:20:59,564
用何物换取?
What shall we give for it?

324
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:01,334
倾吾所有
All that is ours.

325
00:21:01,413 --> 00:21:03,843
为何换取?
Why should we give it?

326
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:07,071
因为守信
For the sake of the trust.

327
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:12,888
这是个寻宝迷题
Why, it's a treasure hunt.

328
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:16,259
不 不 我记得小时候
Oh no, no, I remember as children

329
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,865
我们总想破解它
we often tried to solve it.

330
00:21:17,937 --> 00:21:19,359
总是徒劳无功
It leads nowhere.

331
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:22,658
布兰斯顿以前看过这份东西吗?
Could Brunston have seen this before last night?

332
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,326
有可能
Well it's possible.

333
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:26,280
我们从不费心藏起来
We took no pains to hide it

334
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:28,193
但他要来有什么用呢?
but what could he want with it?

335
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,432
明显是想加深记忆
Obviously he was refreshing his memory.

336
00:21:32,514 --> 00:21:35,882
你说你进去时
You say that he had some map or chart,

337
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,687
他正把某些地图或图表
which he was thrust back into his pocket

338
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,116
往口袋里塞?
the moment you appeared?

339
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,851
似乎是的
That's what it looked like.

340
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,070
好吧
Yes.

341
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,402
我们必须再次研究这份礼典
We must reexamine this ritual.

342
00:21:44,481 --> 00:21:45,868
这些数据明显是指向
The measurements obviously refer

343
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:47,185
某一特定地点
to some exact spot

344
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:49,859
礼典的其余部分没有明确指明
to which the rest of the document eludes.

345
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:52,158
有两个提示?
You are given two guides?

346
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:57,063
是的 榆树和橡树
Yes, an elm and an oak.

347
00:21:57,142 --> 00:22:04,234
先生们 橡树中有棵树王
And gentlemen, there is a patriarch among oaks.

348
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,493
绝对是庄园内最古老的橡树
Certainly the oldest oak on the estate.

349
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:12,158
这棵树肯定在诺曼底人
This tree must have been here

350
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,770
征服英国时就存在了
in the time of the Norman Conquest.

351
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,227
非常可能
In all probability

352
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,724
但我告诉你
but I tell you

353
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,257
这不可能是礼典中的橡树 福尔摩斯
it can't be the oak referred to, Holmes.

354
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:19,466
历代的马斯格雷夫
Generations of Musgrave's

355
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,791
都尝试破解这礼典
have attempted to solve it.

356
00:22:20,868 --> 00:22:22,634
有一半的地都被挖过
They've dug up half this field.

357
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,399
你说得对 马斯格雷夫
You are right, Musgrave,

358
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:38,573
这不是礼典中的橡树
this is not the oak referred to in the ritual.

359
00:22:38,644 --> 00:22:40,410
这附近还有没有
Are there any other large oaks

360
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:42,112
别的大橡树?
in the immediate vicinity?

361
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:47,303
房子一英里内没有
Not within a mile of the house.

362
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:50,981
太阳于何处?
Where was the sun?

363
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:53,282
橡树之上
Over the oak.

364
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:54,947
你今天什么也做不了
You can make nothing of it today, old man,

365
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:57,105
天气变了
the weather's turned.

366
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,927
理查德先生      早上好
Sir Richard.        Good morning.

367
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:02,025
这有八英尺深
It's eight foot deep here.

368
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:04,425
可怜的疯女孩
Poor demented girl.

369
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:05,942
还有希望
We must live and hope, old man.

370
00:25:05,993 --> 00:25:07,863
尸体还没找到呢
There's been no body found yet.

371
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,705
一无所获 先生
Nothing so far sir.

372
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:12,482
我们都快捞遍了
We've just about covered all of it.

373
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:14,742
这里有发现!
We found something!

374
00:25:51,946 --> 00:25:56,390
里面有什么?
What does it contain?

375
00:25:56,466 --> 00:25:59,522
毫无价值的东西
Nothing of value.

376
00:25:59,593 --> 00:26:01,464
任何人任何时候能抛这么个袋子
It could have been thrown in by anyone at anytime.

377
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,648
是最近扔的 否则水早就把它腐蚀了
No recently or the water would have rotted the bag.

378
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,228
女仆昨晚抛的
The maid last night.

379
00:26:08,805 --> 00:26:10,819
这能表明她来过湖边
Well it would explain her journey to the mere

380
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:15,084
但接着又去哪了呢?
but then where did she go?

381
00:26:19,963 --> 00:26:23,186
这里啥都没有 福尔摩斯
There's nothing here, Holmes.

382
00:26:23,265 --> 00:26:24,888
只是一堆
It's just a mass of,

383
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:30,276
生锈褪色的金属和鹅卵石
rusted and discolored metal and some pebbles.

384
00:26:30,356 --> 00:26:32,335
而布兰斯顿和瑞秋
And where is Brunton

385
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:33,935
在哪里?
or Rachel?

386
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:35,700
为什么有人会费神
Why should anybody bother

387
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:37,887
把这些东西扔进湖里?
to throw this into the lake?

388
00:26:45,164 --> 00:26:46,514
我确信
I am convinced

389
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:47,975
没有三个谜团
that there are not three mysteries here,

390
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,257
只有一个
but only one,

391
00:26:49,336 --> 00:26:50,923
只要解开一个
and the solution of one

392
00:26:51,004 --> 00:26:53,776
就能顺藤摸瓜 解决其余的谜团
may prove the solutions to the others.

393
00:26:53,854 --> 00:26:55,548
布兰斯顿肯定在这里发现什么
Apparently Brunton saw something in this,

394
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:58,257
而你未能发现 马斯格雷夫
which escaped your forbears, Musgrave,

395
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:00,909
他希望能从中得利
from which he expected some personal advantage.

396
00:27:00,981 --> 00:27:04,168
如果我没推测错
If I can read it right

397
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,885
我手中掌握着
I hold in my hand the clue

398
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:10,561
关于管家布兰斯顿和女仆瑞秋
to the truth concerning both the butler Brunton

399
00:27:10,643 --> 00:27:13,629
事情真相的线索
and the maid Howells.

400
00:27:13,702 --> 00:27:16,272
太阳于何处? 橡树之上
Wherever is the sun over the oak?

401
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,850
影子于何处? 榆树之下
Where was the shadow on the elm?

402
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:29,092
这就是榆树生长的位置?
So this is where it grew?

403
00:27:29,171 --> 00:27:30,723
是的
Yes.

404
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:32,119
我想已经不可能告诉我
I suppose it's impossible

405
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:33,722
树的高度了吧?
to tell me how high it was?

406
00:27:33,794 --> 00:27:35,322
我立马就能告诉你
I can give you that at once.

407
00:27:35,393 --> 00:27:38,899
六十四英尺
It was sixty-four feet.

408
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,702
我以前的家庭教师
It's my old tutor;

409
00:27:40,781 --> 00:27:42,438
教我学三角学(研究三角形边和角间关系的学科)
he used to give me lessons in trigonometry.

410
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,761
我小时候就知道
When I was a lad I used to know

411
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,153
庄园内每棵树
the height of every tree

412
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,209
每座建筑的高度了
and building on this estate.

413
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:51,096
我很感激你的家庭教师
I am grateful to your tutor.

414
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:53,947
布兰斯顿曾经在这个草坪
Tell me did Brunton ever ask you such a question

415
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:58,218
问过同样的问题吗?
here on this lawn?

416
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,658
你让我想起来了
Now that you call it to my mind.

417
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:22,448
布兰斯顿?
Brunton?

418
00:28:22,528 --> 00:28:26,035
你在这做什么呢?
What are you doing here?

419
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:28,014
享受美好的夜晚 先生
Enjoying the evening, sir.

420
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,498
这是我的私人草坪
This is my private lawn.

421
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:34,586
请原谅我请教一个问题
You pardon me for asking sir,

422
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,187
曾经在这里的那棵
the elm that once stood here,

423
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:38,057
被雷击中的榆树
that was struck by lightning,

424
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:39,627
你已经不记得有多高了
you wouldn't remember the height of it

425
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,270
是吗 先生?
would you sir?

426
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:44,970
你为什么想知道这个呢?
Well why should you want to know that?

427
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:47,517
我和特雷杰丽丝先生在争论呢
Well I'm arguing with Mr. Tregallis about it.

428
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,469
我说是五十英尺高 他说不止
I say it was fifty feet, he put it higher.

429
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:52,975
我们打了个小赌
We have a small wager on it.

430
00:28:53,048 --> 00:28:55,856
那你得输了 布兰斯顿
Oh, well you've lost your wager, Brunton.

431
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:58,598
是六十四英尺高
It was sixty-four feet.

432
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,522
是吗?
Awe, was it?

433
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,506
我还是大方点
I shall just have to be a good sport

434
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,629
愿赌服输吧
and pay up then.

435
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,401
谢谢 先生
Thank you sir.

436
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:37,781
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

437
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:41,740
没错 华生
Huh?

438
00:29:41,816 --> 00:29:44,482
我的天啊!
Oh good lord!

439
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,362
我们现在必须找到
Now we must find where

440
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,454
当太阳偏离橡树时
the shadow of the elm would have fallen

441
00:29:48,526 --> 00:29:51,369
榆树的影子会落到哪里
when the sun is just clear of that oak.

442
00:29:51,446 --> 00:29:53,139
那很有难度 福尔摩斯
Well that'll be difficult, Holmes,

443
00:29:53,218 --> 00:29:54,875
因为榆树已经没了
since the elm's no longer there.

444
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:56,483
来吧 华生
Oh now come, Watson.

445
00:29:56,556 --> 00:29:59,506
如果布兰斯顿能做到 我们也能
If Brunton can do it then so can we.

446
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:03,086
答案就在三角学中
The answer lies in trigonometry.

447
00:30:03,158 --> 00:30:05,693
马斯格雷夫 我需要庄园里的
Musgrave I need all the fishing rods

448
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,466
所有鱼竿
that you have in the hall.

449
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,217
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

450
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:51,951
是的
Yes.

451
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:54,461
我...我不太明白
I... I don't quite follow this.

452
00:30:54,536 --> 00:30:57,414
太好了!
Awe splendid!

453
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:01,791
马斯格雷夫?
Musgrave?

454
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:04,712
庄园里所有的鱼竿
Every rod in the house.

455
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,412
谢谢
Thank you.

456
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,925
请把尺子给我 华生
Measuring stick please, Watson.

457
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,612
请帮我拿着好吗 马斯格雷夫?
Would you hold that for me, Musgrave please?

458
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:32,972
还有那个?
And that?

459
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,228
现在将绳子一端
Now will you take the last yard of the string

460
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,188
绑在鱼竿底部 华生
and tie it to the base of the fishing rod, Watson?

461
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:40,372
好的
Yes.

462
00:31:40,453 --> 00:31:41,839
完成以后
And when you've done that

463
00:31:41,914 --> 00:31:43,537
带着礼典
would you bring the Ritual

464
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,940
来草坪找我
and join me on the lawn?

465
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,512
请量一下那个影子好吗 华生?
Would you measure that shadow, please Watson?

466
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:24,449
九英尺
Nine feet.

467
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:26,082
这一来就很容易计算了
So the calculation is now a simple one.

468
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:27,857
如果鱼竿是六英尺
If a fishing rod of six feet

469
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:29,523
投下个影子是九英尺
throws a shadow of nine feet

470
00:32:29,605 --> 00:32:30,793
榆树高六十四英尺
then a tree of sixty-four feet

471
00:32:30,927 --> 00:32:31,899
那影子是?
would throw one of?

472
00:32:32,071 --> 00:32:32,886
九十八
Ninety-eight.

473
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:35,472
九十六
Ninety-six.

474
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,936
没错
Yes of course.

475
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,665
两者肯定在
And the line of one of course

476
00:32:38,747 --> 00:32:40,821
同一直线上
would be the line of the other.

477
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:04,217
华生 看!
Watson look!

478
00:33:04,296 --> 00:33:06,582
距离我的记号两英寸
Two inches from mine.

479
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,566
布兰斯顿作的记号
A mark made by Brunton.

480
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,654
把步数念给我听
Now read out the steps.

481
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,297
向西八步乘八步

483
00:33:37,284 --> 00:33:41,349
向南七步乘七步

向西
West.

486
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:53,922
六步乘六步

487
00:33:58,627 --> 00:34:00,178
三十六步 然后
Thirty-six and

488
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:02,829
向南五步乘五步
South Five by five.

489
00:34:42,737 --> 00:34:43,909
然后呢?
And?

490
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,091
两步乘两步
Two by Two.

491
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:50,336
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

492
00:34:50,419 --> 00:34:52,493
不可能
I don't believe it.

493
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:57,918
你计算有误
Some mistake in your calculations.

494
00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,420
不可能
That's impossible.

495
00:35:06,478 --> 00:35:07,941
布兰斯顿还没来过这
Brunton hasn't been here.

496
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,299
两步乘两步 于此下方
Two by two and so under.

497
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,294
这些石头很多年没有动过了
These stones haven't been moved in many a long year.

498
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:16,204
于此下方
And under.

499
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:17,938
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

500
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:21,112
你忘记了"于此下方"
You've forgotten the 'and under.'

501
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:23,883
这里有地窖么?
Is there a cellar under here?

502
00:35:23,962 --> 00:35:26,591
有 年代和房子一样老
As old as the house.

503
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:46,658
这里原本遍地都是木材
There's been wood all over the floor.

504
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,387
那是布兰斯顿的围巾
That's Brunton's muffler.

505
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:49,676
我确定
I'd swear to it.

506
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:51,341
华生!
Watson!

507
00:37:00,249 --> 00:37:01,977
巡官 这是我的一位朋友
Inspector, this is a friend of mine,

508
00:37:02,056 --> 00:37:03,334
华生医生
Doctor Watson.

509
00:37:03,412 --> 00:37:04,655
巡官
Inspector,

510
00:37:04,733 --> 00:37:07,162
我在法医学方面有些许经验
I have some experience in forensic pathology.

511
00:37:07,236 --> 00:37:09,286
这名男子已经死亡两天了
The man has been dead for two days.

512
00:37:09,356 --> 00:37:11,500
窒息死亡
Cause of death suffocation.

513
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:14,673
没有伤口或瘀伤 先生?
No wound or bruise on this person, sir?

514
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:16,367
没有
None.

515
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,085
意外 是吗?
Accident hey?

516
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:21,753
毫无疑问
Oh there's no doubt about it.

517
00:37:21,836 --> 00:37:23,423
他肯定一个人在那里
He must have been down there alone

518
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:27,662
石板就盖上了 可怜的人
and the flagstone just fell shut on him, poor fellow.

519
00:37:27,744 --> 00:37:28,987
雷金纳德先生
Sir Reginald,

520
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:30,759
据说您的管家所在的地下室
I'm told that your butler was down in the cellar

521
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:34,025
已经废弃不用了
in an unused part of the house.

522
00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:36,321
他在那里做什么 先生?
What was his business there sir?

523
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,891
管家的工作
A butler's duties

524
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,492
是多样且多变的 巡官
are many and varied, Inspector.

525
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:41,187
我无法回答那个问题
I can't possibly answer that question.

526
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:42,724
在那个地方 没有人能听见
Well no one would have heard his cries for help

527
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,324
他的呼救声
in that part of the house,

528
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,160
那便是关键 巡官
that is the point surely, Inspector.

529
00:37:57,743 --> 00:37:59,816
特雷杰丽丝
Tregallis.

530
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:00,867
瑞秋!
Rachel!

531
00:38:00,941 --> 00:38:02,148
是她干的!
She done it!

532
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:03,328
她把他给杀了!
She killed him!

533
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,422
所以逃跑了!
That's why she ran away!

534
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:06,737
特雷杰丽丝!
Tregallis!

535
00:38:06,815 --> 00:38:08,438
瑞秋?
Rachel?

536
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,869
没什么
It's nothing.

537
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:11,885
仆人们伤心这很正常
The servants are naturally upset.

538
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,487
瑞秋是谁?
Well who is this Rachel?

539
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:14,979
我的女仆之一
One of my housemaids.

540
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,440
她和布兰斯顿订婚了
She was engaged to Brunton.

541
00:38:16,514 --> 00:38:18,658
请把他盖上
Do please cover him up.

542
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:20,124
有一天晚上他失踪了
One evening he disappeared.

543
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,854
她就病恹恹然后离开了
She became ill and left.

544
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,523
我想见见她
Well I shall want to see her.

545
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,132
还有刚刚那位年轻女士
I shall want to see that young woman also.

546
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,931
巡佐
Sergeant.

547
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,340
把他抬走
All right take him away

548
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:32,597
医生 请
Doctor please.

549
00:38:42,097 --> 00:38:43,649
当地的巡官 福尔摩斯
The local inspector Holmes.

550
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:45,947
如果你能找到一个解释
If you could find a plausible explanation

551
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:50,777
能避免家丑外扬...
to avoid publicity in this retched...

552
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:52,965
我得承认
I must confess

553
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,061
迄今为止 我对自己的调查
that so far I am disappointed

554
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:57,941
非常失望
in my investigation.

555
00:38:58,017 --> 00:38:59,746
我一度认为
I had reckoned upon solving the matter

556
00:38:59,824 --> 00:39:01,245
只要来到礼典所指的地方
when once I'd find the place

557
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,670
就能解开迷题
referred to in the Ritual

558
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:05,315
但现在我身在此地
but now that I'm here

559
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,151
仍然无法得知
I'm as far as ever

560
00:39:07,228 --> 00:39:08,957
你家族如此精心埋藏的
from knowing where it was your family concealed

561
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,702
究竟是什么
with such an elaborate precautions.

562
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:14,104
但你解决了布兰斯顿的迷题
But you've solved my mystery of Brunton.

563
00:39:14,181 --> 00:39:15,981
究竟是怎样?
But how?

564
00:39:16,058 --> 00:39:19,281
他为什么会死
How did his fate come upon him

565
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,947
以及失踪的女士
and what part has been played

566
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,245
在这其中又扮演了什么角色?
by the woman whose disappeared?

567
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:33,887
我要解释一下福尔摩斯的破案方式
I should explain Holmes methods in such cases.

568
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:37,431
他...他在估量对方的智慧后
He... he puts himself in the man's place

569
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:40,728
把自己代入对方的角色
having first gauged his intelligence

570
00:39:40,808 --> 00:39:42,360
然后他...
and then he...

571
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:44,550
会想象假如是他
he tries to imagine how he himself

572
00:39:44,631 --> 00:39:46,325
在同样的情况下
would have proceeded

573
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:48,654
会如何处理
in similar circumstances.

574
00:39:48,732 --> 00:39:51,161
这个案件中
In this case

575
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:54,353
布兰斯顿绝顶聪明
Brunton's intelligence is first rate.

576
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,161
因此不必担心
So you see it is unnecessary

577
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,269
他观察问题会出现"个人观察容许误差"
to make allowance for the personal equation.

578
00:40:03,506 --> 00:40:06,277
这是天文学家的说法
As the astronomers have dubbed it.

579
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:36,247
他知道有东西被藏起来了
He knows something is concealed.

580
00:40:41,185 --> 00:40:43,472
他发现了地点
He has spotted the place.

581
00:41:30,998 --> 00:41:32,762
他发现靠一个人的力量
He has found the stone is too heavy

582
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,747
难以拉动石板
for a man to move unaided.

583
00:41:34,821 --> 00:41:40,486
他该怎么办呢?
So what does he do?

584
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:42,213
找外人帮忙
Help from outside.

585
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:44,024
没有人可以信任
No one to trust.

586
00:41:44,103 --> 00:41:48,653
找内部的人帮忙? 找谁呢?
Help from inside but who?

587
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:51,426
瑞秋
Rachel.

588
00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:53,058
她还爱着他
She still loves him.

589
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,734
从她的眼里就能看出来
He sees it in her eyes.

590
00:42:07,878 --> 00:42:10,507
我是来道歉的 亲爱的
I'm here to say I'm sorry my love.

591
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,082
我是个愚蠢的人
I'm a foolish man.

592
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,575
我配不上你
I don't deserve you.

593
00:42:13,649 --> 00:42:15,271
你配不上
You don't.

594
00:42:15,352 --> 00:42:17,675
原谅我 瑞秋
Forgive me Rachel.

595
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,515
为什么?
Why?

596
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:21,535
没有别的人能拥有我的心
There's no one else for me.

597
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,595
从没有过 你知道的
No one ever has been, you know that.

598
00:42:24,668 --> 00:42:29,183
这个房子在吞噬你的灵魂
It's this house it eats into your soul.

599
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,542
让我带你离开
Let me take you away from here.

600
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:34,048
重新开始
We'll start afresh.

601
00:42:34,123 --> 00:42:36,064
你的承诺
Your promises.

602
00:42:36,138 --> 00:42:41,447
哦 理查德 你毫无顾忌和他人发生关系
Oh Richard, you make love so freely.

603
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:46,490
你从未爱过我
You never loved me.

604
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:49,136
你错了
Oh you're wrong.

605
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,750
我既爱你的美貌 也爱你的内心
I love you for your beauty and your spirit.

606
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:54,898
我们是天造地设的一对
We're a perfect match.

607
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:57,821
我的头脑加上你的心灵
With my brains and your heart

608
00:42:57,899 --> 00:43:00,884
自由在呼唤我们
what do we want with service to others

609
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:03,872
为什么还要为他人服务呢? 亲爱的
when a world is out there calling us, my love?

610
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:07,205
身无分文怎么生存?
And how do we get out there with no money?

611
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:10,649
我们会有钱的
We'll have all the money we need.

612
00:43:10,726 --> 00:43:12,596
我在这所房子里找到了
I found something in this house

613
00:43:12,672 --> 00:43:15,136
所有地主都找不到的东西
all them country squires have missed.

614
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:17,779
而我找到了 我们可以离开了
Now I've found it and we're ready to go.

615
00:43:17,851 --> 00:43:19,830
和你一起离开
But not without you,

616
00:43:19,902 --> 00:43:23,576
没了你我无法生存
I couldn't live without you.

617
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:26,155
我要做你的丈夫 瑞秋
I'm to be your husband, Rachel.

618
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:32,689
什么钱?
What money?

619
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:36,436
你找到什么了?
What have you found?

620
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,591
跟我来
Come with me.

621
00:43:38,673 --> 00:43:40,722
穿上衣服 我带你去
Put on your gown, I'll show you.

622
00:43:46,251 --> 00:43:48,395
轻点
Softly now.

623
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:09,215
就在这 在石板下面
There it is, under that stone.

624
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:12,390
只需把石板拉起
All we have to do is lift it.

625
00:44:15,207 --> 00:44:17,706
那块木头
Now there's some wood.

626
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:21,488
我拉起来的时候你把它塞进去
Now when I lift this you wedge it.

627
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:24,338
快点 女人 按我说的做!
Come on woman, do as I tell you!

628
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:29,936
准备好了吗?
Ready?

629
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:37,239
再加一块
And another one.

630
00:44:43,883 --> 00:44:46,347
再来一块
And that one over there.

631
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:56,143
这块木头上有轻微的凹痕
There is a slight indentation on this log.

632
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:59,209
这块也是
And on this.

633
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:01,426
由石板的重量造成的
Caused by the weight of the stone.

634
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:03,936
对女士来说是个重活
Heavy work for a woman.

635
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,829
而这个 我认为
And this, I think,

636
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:14,671
作为最后的支撑
has been used finally as a support.

那就是我们的宝贝
There's our treasure.

638
00:45:26,847 --> 00:45:29,346
那箱子已经在这200多年了
That box is laying there for two centuries or more.

639
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,077
你要偷了它吗?
Will you steal it?

640
00:45:31,158 --> 00:45:33,337
没人知其存在的东西 怎么偷?
How can you steal what nobody knows exists?

641
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,040
那你是怎么知道的?
Well how did you know then?

642
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:36,777
靠智慧 姑娘
Brains my girl.

643
00:45:36,858 --> 00:45:39,392
历史和数学
History and mathematics.

644
00:45:39,464 --> 00:45:43,315
来 帮我举着灯
Here, hold the light for me.

645
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:12,791
把灯举近点
Bring the light closer.

646
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:15,712
赚大钱!
Make a fortune!

647
00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,047
是啊 真有赚头啊
Oh yes, that's a fine profit.

648
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:21,306
安静点
Be quiet.

649
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,531
这里肯定有点价值的
There must be some value in it.

650
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:26,240
你真聪明啊!
Oh how clever are you!

651
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:28,608
应该叫自负
A pride more like.

652
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,936
比自己的主人博学!
Known better than your masters!

653
00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:32,401
安静点 女人
Quiet woman.

654
00:46:32,474 --> 00:46:33,717
我知道你所谓的聪明
I know your cleverness.

655
00:46:33,796 --> 00:46:37,267
丈夫 你只想利用我!
Husband, you just needed me to help you!

656
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:38,761
如果真有什么财宝
If it had been treasure

657
00:46:38,835 --> 00:46:40,600
你早就把我甩得远远的了!
you'd of been over the way without me!

658
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,522
你会带着她走!
You would have gone with her!

659
00:46:43,598 --> 00:46:46,405
你是个白痴
You're a fool if you believe that.

660
00:46:52,427 --> 00:46:57,533
拿着
Here take this.

661
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,865
帮我上去
Now help me out of here.

662
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,894
瑞秋!
Rachel!

663
00:47:03,968 --> 00:47:05,946
瑞秋!
Rachel!

664
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:09,490
我亲爱的 找人帮忙
My love, get help.

665
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:12,192
我呼吸不了
I can't breath.

666
00:47:12,275 --> 00:47:15,984
去找福尔摩斯先生 快
Get Mr. Holmes, quickly.

667
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:18,493
求你了 亲爱的
Please, my love.

668
00:47:18,566 --> 00:47:20,889
瑞秋!
Rachel!

669
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:24,022
上帝啊 救救我
Oh God, help me.

670
00:47:24,095 --> 00:47:26,168
瑞秋!
Rachel!

671
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:28,084
瑞秋!
Rachel!

672
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:29,890
救命!
Help!

673
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:32,562
瑞秋!
Rachel!

674
00:47:32,644 --> 00:47:34,065
救救我!
Help me!

675
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:35,903
瑞秋!
Rachel!

676
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:38,446
瑞秋 救救我!
Rachel, help me!

677
00:47:54,682 --> 00:47:57,005
那就能解释她第二天早餐时
That will explain her blanched face

678
00:47:57,081 --> 00:47:58,537
苍白的脸
and her fevered brain

679
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:00,553
和低烧了
at breakfast the next morning.

680
00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:06,075
只有些菌类植物
Nothing but fungi.

681
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:08,404
箱子里有什么 福尔摩斯?
But what was in the box, Holmes?

682
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:23,007
查理一世国王
Sir Charles the First.

683
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:26,968
也许能找到查理一世的其他物品
We may find something else of Charles the First.

684
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:33,575
湖里钓上来的袋子
The bag that was fished from the mere.

685
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:38,236
先生们 看
Gentlemen, look.

686
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:41,908
宝石
It's a jewel.

687
00:48:41,992 --> 00:48:44,136
传家宝
A family heirloom.

688
00:48:44,216 --> 00:48:45,673
很可能
Well it's possible.

689
00:48:45,746 --> 00:48:47,440
你的祖先拉夫・马斯格雷夫
You're ancestor, Sir Ralph Musgrave,

690
00:48:47,518 --> 00:48:50,326
是位杰出的保皇党党员吗?
was he a prominent cavalier?

691
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:51,825
是的
Oh yes indeed.

692
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:53,522
是的 共和国时期(克伦威尔为首的清教徒建立)
Yes he was close to Charles the Second

693
00:48:53,602 --> 00:48:56,268
他与被放逐的查理二世十分亲密
in his wanderings during the Commonwealth.

694
00:48:56,349 --> 00:48:58,635
这构成我们所需信息的
Then I think that should give us

695
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:01,141
最后一环
the last link that we wanted.

696
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:07,001
先生们 你们必须知道
Gentlemen, you must bear mind

697
00:49:07,059 --> 00:49:09,584
当皇室成员被流放时
when the royal party were driven into exile

698
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:11,046
多会将其
they probably left

699
00:49:11,121 --> 00:49:13,788
许多珍贵的财物
many of their most precious possessions

700
00:49:14,006 --> 00:49:15,048
埋藏起来
buried behind them

701
00:49:15,712 --> 00:49:17,088
以备在和平时期
with the intention of returning for them

702
00:49:17,169 --> 00:49:20,226
他们回归故土时使用
in a more peaceful time.

703
00:49:20,299 --> 00:49:23,805
黄金 马斯格雷夫
Gold, Musgrave.

704
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:28,464
华生 你手中的碎片
Watson I believe you have in your hand a relic,

705
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:30,823
不仅其本身价值很高
which is not only of great intrinsic value,

706
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,610
其历史价值亦不相伯仲
but also great importance as a historical curiosity.

707
00:49:34,687 --> 00:49:37,744
这是什么?
Well what is it?

708
00:49:37,816 --> 00:49:42,958
这是一块碎片
Nothing less than a fragment

709
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:46,989
属于古英格兰国王皇冠的一部分
of the ancient crown of the kings of England.

710
00:49:47,063 --> 00:49:49,041
皇冠!
The crown!

711
00:49:49,115 --> 00:49:50,536
不 不 福尔摩斯
Oh no, no, Holmes.

712
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:52,752
这太不切实际了
It's too amiable.

713
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,956
回想一下礼典
Now consider the ritual.

714
00:50:01,036 --> 00:50:03,879
是怎么说的?
How does it run?

715
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:05,579
它是谁的?
Whose was it?

716
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:08,124
那个离开的人
His who is gone.

717
00:50:08,197 --> 00:50:10,697
那是指被处死的查理一世
That was the execution of Charles.

718
00:50:10,769 --> 00:50:14,099
接着是"谁应拥有它?"
And then who shall have it?

719
00:50:14,176 --> 00:50:16,534
那个将到来的人
He who will come.

720
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,718
这是指查理二世
That was Charles the Second,

721
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,023
其归来已经预见到了
whose advent was already foreseen.

722
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,637
我想 毫无疑问 先生们
There can, I think, be no doubt, gentlemen,

723
00:50:24,709 --> 00:50:28,453
这个破碎得不成型的皇冠
that this battered and shapeless diadem

724
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:31,275
曾经属于斯图亚特王朝
once encircle the brows of the royal Stuart's.

725
00:50:31,347 --> 00:50:35,506
那怎么会出现在我家?
But how came it into my family?

726
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:38,182
当查理一世被处决时
When Charles the First was executed

727
00:50:38,265 --> 00:50:40,136
皇冠被抢走了
the crown was seized.

728
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:42,154
摔成碎片
Broken into pieces

729
00:50:42,228 --> 00:50:45,806
高价卖出
and sold for a thousand guineas.

730
00:51:04,265 --> 00:51:07,700
至此下落不明
Since then there has been no trace of it,

731
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,683
直至现在
until now.

732
00:51:09,758 --> 00:51:12,328
为什么查理二世回来时不拿走?
But why did Charles not get it back on his return?

733
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:15,517
这个问题 也许永远不会有答案
That is a question, which may never be answered.

734
00:51:15,598 --> 00:51:20,493
你的祖先去世时 由于疏忽
When you ancestor died by some oversight,

735
00:51:20,568 --> 00:51:24,348
将这个指引留给其子孙
he left this guide to his descendent

736
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:27,757
而没对其内容做任何解释
without ever explaining the meaning of it.

737
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:30,535
世代相传
Father to son.

738
00:51:30,614 --> 00:51:33,456
直至落入一名男子手中
Until at last it came within reach

739
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:39,685
将谜团解开
of a man who tore it's secret out of it

740
00:51:39,756 --> 00:51:44,722
并丧命于这场冒险中
and lost his life in the venture.

741
00:51:44,797 --> 00:51:46,846
瑞秋!
Rachel!

742
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:55,701
瑞秋!
Rachel!

743
00:51:57,762 --> 00:51:59,419
木棍真的是自行滑落吗
Was it chance that the wood slipped

744
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:02,201
她的罪仅在于没有呼救吗?
was she only guilty of silence?

745
00:52:02,281 --> 00:52:04,531
她有着容易激动的凯尔特人脾性
She had a passionate, Celtic soul.

746
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:05,924
那个男人负了他
The man had wronged her.

747
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,421
她可以决定其生死
She had it in her power.

748
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:10,089
是为了复仇
Might it rather been vengeance

749
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:12,458
而将石板盖上吗?
that sent the stone crashing?

750
00:52:12,536 --> 00:52:15,415
用她的双手把木棍抽走
Her hand that dashed it away.

751
00:52:15,491 --> 00:52:17,884
她现在在哪里呢?
Now what has become of her?

752
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:21,559
可能已经带着她的秘密
Very probably she's far away from Hurlstone now

753
00:52:21,643 --> 00:52:25,007
远走高飞了
and carries her secret with her.

754
