决一死战
account with Professor Moriarty,

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,216
莫里亚蒂是当时最危险的罪犯

10
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,208
两个人在险要之地单独决斗
The two men were alone in that dreadful place

11
00:01:05,283 --> 00:01:06,706
但是结果
but the outcome of their struggle

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,591
正如如人人所料
was obvious to a trained observer.

13

福尔摩斯击败了
Holmes had achieved the destruction

00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,248
他的死敌
of his archenemy,

15
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,135

从我亲爱的朋友去世
It is now three long years

18
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:53,336
已经过去漫长的三年了
since my dear friend plunged to his death.

19
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:57,267
在那漩涡激荡的无底深渊中
There deep down under the swirling water

伦敦的每一个角落
there is hardly a corner of London

25
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:20,410
都会令我忆起自己的老朋友
that does not remind me of my old friend.

26
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:24,899
我再也未曾踏足贝克街
I never walk down Baker Street

27
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:26,257
因为我们一起在那里渡过的日子里
where we shared rooms

28
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,959
经历了无数惊心动魄的案件
for so many eventful years

29
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,319
能让我脑海总是浮现出
without it reminding me

30
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,412
过去的往事
only too keenly of the past

31
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,394
还有那位我认为是
and the loss of one I shall ever regard

32
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:37,181
世上最优秀聪明的人
as the best and wisest man I have ever known.

我仍对刑事案件
I retained a keen interest

34
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,863
保持着浓厚的兴趣
in criminal matters

35
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,990
通过做警局的法医
and supplemented my meager practice

36
00:02:57,062 --> 00:03:00,159
来补充匮乏的消息来源
by working as a police surgeon.

37
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:06,384
那是1894年的早春
It was in the early spring of 1894

38
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:08,227
我一大早便应约
that I was called out early in the morning

39
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:10,734
前往西郊
to an appointment in the west end.

40
00:03:12,863 --> 00:03:13,799

很高兴见到你
I'm glad to see you.

48
00:03:32,524 --> 00:03:34,955
那可是尊敬的罗诺德・阿德尔
The Honorable Ronald Adair.

49
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,762
请不要放在那里
Not there sir if you please.

50
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:38,856
抱歉
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,443
23岁

00:03:47,523 --> 00:03:48,626
梅鲁斯伯爵夫妇的

他父亲是澳大利亚某殖民地的总督
father is governor of one of the Australian colonies,

55
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,690
他母亲冬天住在伦敦
mother in London for the winter,

56
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,230
儿子和女儿
son and daughter

57
00:03:57,302 --> 00:03:59,353
和他一起住在这房子里
are living in this house with him.

58
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,397
自杀?
Suicide?

59
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:01,962
不是
No.

60
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,252
没有发现武器
No weapon.

61
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,584
呃 还有这个
Oh uh, this.

62
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,732
这个是在尸体旁的地板上发现的
This found on the floor beside the corpse.

63
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:13,307
一颗软弹头的左轮枪子弹
It's one of those soft nose revolver bullets,

64
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,731
可怕的东西
horrible things.

65
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:16,086
肯定是直接打穿了
Must have gone right through

66
00:04:16,163 --> 00:04:19,188
可怜的罗诺德的脑袋
the poor fellows head.

67
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:20,506
不同寻常 不是吗
It's unusual, isn't it,

68
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,908
一把手枪竟然有这么大的威力
for a pistol to have such velocity?

69
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,752
更像是一把来福枪
More like a rifle.

70
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:26,488
没错
Yes.

71
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,715
应该是谋杀 警探
Well it's murder then Inspector.

72
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:30,455
是的
Oh yes.

73
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,780
有没有什么推断?
Any idea who it was?

74
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:33,281
没有
No.

75
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:34,457
现在为时尚早
It's early days yet

76
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:35,890
但这个案子
but this one looks to me

77
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,210
看起来像是
as if it could turn out to be

78
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:39,504
谜团重重
a bit of a puzzle.

79
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,909
假设他当时
Well presumably he was

80
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,930
坐在那把椅子上
sitting in that chair.

81
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:47,160
我想他正在数钱
I suppose counting that money.

82
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,734
杀人者不可能
Oh the murderer doesn't appear

83
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,159
是个小偷
to have been a thief.

84
00:04:50,234 --> 00:04:51,622
阿德尔整晚
Adair had spent the evening

85
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:53,497
都在俱乐部打牌
playing cards at his club.

86
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,122
准备好最后一搏了
Time for one last hand?

87
00:05:13,201 --> 00:05:14,410
是的 当然
Oh yes indeed.

88
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:16,850
终于可以复仇了
Now we can get our revenge.

89
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,672
谢谢
Thank you.

90
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:31,848
罗纳德 你下多少赌注呢?
Now Ronald, what's the damage?

91
00:06:50,956 --> 00:06:52,450
罗纳德?
Ronald?

92
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:55,997
罗纳德?
Ronald?

93
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:59,199
罗纳德?
Ronald?

94
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,545
我想罗纳德
I don't think Ronald

95
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:08,834
不可能又出去了
couldn't have gone out again.

96
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:09,979
是的 夫人
No my lady.

97
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,243
我听到他大约十点半回来的
I heard him come home at about half past ten.

98
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:13,675
之后没有再出去
And he hasn't gone out again,

99
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,552
我很确定
that I'm sure.

100
00:07:21,824 --> 00:07:23,354
罗纳德先生?
Mr. Ronald?

101
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,226
罗纳德先生
Mr. Ronald sir.

102
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:33,337
我去撞开门吧 夫人
Let's break it down my lady.

103
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,691
从尸体的姿势来看
From the condition of the body

104
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:51,915
死亡发生在一瞬间
death was instantaneous.

105
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:55,638
我想杀人者
I suppose the murderer

106
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,306
是从窗户进来的
came in through the window.

107
00:07:57,388 --> 00:08:00,199
窗户是开着的
The window was open.

108
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,664
同样的问题是
Same spot of the matter is

109
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:04,206
没有任何侵入者的痕迹
there are no signs of any intruder,

110
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,233
什么都没有 屋内外都没有
nothing, inside or out.

111
00:08:10,787 --> 00:08:12,804
我可不想大半夜从这里爬上来
I wouldn't like to climb up here at night.

112
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,023
只有猴子才能做得到
It must have been a monkey.

113
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,797
正如你所说 那是不可能的
As you say Doctor, an impossibility.

114
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,026
好像杀人者长了翅膀一样
Looks like the murderer had wings.

115
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,584
这种案子我们的老朋友
Sort of case that would have interested

116
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,874
福尔摩斯肯定会很感兴趣的
our old friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

117
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,412
绝对的
Yes indeed.

118
00:08:30,484 --> 00:08:33,058
多么大的损失啊 医生
What a loss he is Doctor.

119
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:36,735
我不经常用他的理论
I didn't always approve of his methods

120
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:38,312
但他是私人侦探中最棒的
but he was the best amateur there was

121
00:08:38,384 --> 00:08:40,009
空前绝后的
or ever likely to be.

122
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,549
有几次
There were times when

123
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,502
他做的甚至比我还棒
he even got the better of me.

124
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:45,682
好了 警探
All right, Inspector,

125
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:47,042
你该把他
if you arrange for our friend

126
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:48,542
送到太平间去了
to be brought down the mortuary

127
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:49,861
我下午会去验尸的
I'll conduct an autopsy this afternoon.

128
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:51,634
好的 医生
Yes indeed Doctor.

129
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:53,966
到时候再见
See you at the inquest.

由一颗0.45口径的左轮手枪子弹引致

145
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,869

抱歉 法官
I'm sorry sir.

150
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:21,768
我不明白您的意思
I don't understand.

151
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,063
你说子弹来自一把
You say that the bullet

152
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,847
0.45口径的左轮手枪
came from a point four-five revolver

153
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,251
那纯粹是你的个人推断
that is pure speculation on your part.

154
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,911
你没有责任妄自猜测
It is not your business to start guessing

155
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,872
凶器的型号
at the type of weapon used.

156
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,256
这属于警局的职责范围
That is a subject for the police.

157
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,567
抱歉 法官

那么继续吧
Prey continue.

受害人死于致命创伤
Death occurred as the result of a wound

160
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:51,806
该伤口由一颗软弹头铅弹造成

华生 介意我在你的询诊室里

298
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,230
抽根烟吗?
in your consulting room?

难道你还活着?

你真的觉得现在有精神谈这事了吗?

瞧我这多此一举的戏剧性的出现

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,740
让一个高个子一连几个小时
It's no joke when a tall man

323
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:23,305
弯腰驼背
has to take a foot off his stature

324
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:25,630
可不是件轻松的事
for several hours on end.

325
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:35,061
我亲爱的老朋友
Now, my dear fellow,

326
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:36,799
还有一个晚上的
we have a hard and dangerous

327
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:39,549
艰险工作等着我们
night's work ahead of us.

328
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,123
或许最好是
Perhaps it would be better

329
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,749
等这项工作完了以后
if I gave you an account of the whole situation

330
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,862
我再把全部是情况告诉你
when that work is finished.

331
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,190
不 不 不
No, no, no.

332
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:46,726
我很想知道
I'm full of curiosity.

333
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:48,114
更喜欢现在就知道
I should much prefer to hear now.

334
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,065
今晚愿意跟我一起去吗?
But you will come with me tonight?

335
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:51,277
随你说什么时候
When you like,

336
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:52,673
去什么地方都行
where you like.

337
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,102
哈!
Ha!

338
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:56,014
华生
Watson.

339
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,246
真的还像过去那样
This is just like the old days.

340
00:18:59,326 --> 00:19:00,951
我们出发前还有时间
We might have a chance for a mouthful of dinner

341
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:02,312
吃点晚饭
before we need go.

342
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:03,203
当然 晚饭
Dinner of course

343
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,370
但你得先告诉我所有的事
but first you must tell me everything.

344
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:06,838
你确定没关系吗?
You sure you're all right?

345
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,715
是的 我很好
Yeah, I'm fine.

346
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:11,886
好吧...
Well then...

347
00:19:14,185 --> 00:19:17,175
说说那个峡谷
about that chasm.

348
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:18,778
我要爬上来
I had no serious difficulty

349
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:20,581
根本没有什么难度
in getting out of it,

350
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,082
因为很简单
for the very simple reason

351
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:23,649
我根本就没掉进去
that I was never in it.

352
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,859
你根本没掉进去?
You were never in it?

353
00:19:24,939 --> 00:19:26,670
没有 华生
No, Watson.

354
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,037
我根本没掉进去
I never was in it.

355
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,190
可是我在莱辛巴赫瀑布
The note that I left on the rock

356
00:19:31,272 --> 00:19:32,518
给你留的便条
at the Reichenbach Falls

357
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:35,000
完全是真的
was absolutely genuine.

358
00:19:39,765 --> 00:19:41,911
我一点也不怀疑
I had little doubt

359
00:19:41,991 --> 00:19:44,280
我的末日到了
that my career had come to an end

360
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:47,027
当我发现邪恶的莫里亚蒂的身影
when I perceived the somewhat sinister figure of Moriarty

361
00:19:47,107 --> 00:19:48,909
就站在狭窄的走道上
standing upon the narrow pathway

362
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:52,320
那条窄道通向安全地带
that led to safety.

363
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:57,748
在他灰色的眼睛里我看到了邪恶的意图
I read an inexorable purpose in his gray eyes.

364
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:00,150
我得到他的同意
I managed to obtain his courteous permission

365
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:01,435
写下了一张便条
to write the note,

366
00:20:01,513 --> 00:20:03,495
就是你后来看到的那张
which you afterwards received.

367
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:15,641
我将它视若珍宝 好好保存着
It has remained my treasured possession.

368
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:16,921
直到几个月后
It was a few months later

369
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:18,767
我津津有味的读到了
that I read with great interest

370
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:21,869
你对我的死的描述
your description of my death.

371
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,150
写得很好
It was excellently done,

372
00:20:23,229 --> 00:20:24,024
充满生动
the most picturesque

373
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,125
而刺激的想象
and exciting piece of fiction.

374
00:20:27,197 --> 00:20:28,513
当然 我发自内心的高兴
Well I'm certainly glad

375
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:29,597
因为我写的
from the bottom of my heart

376
00:20:29,668 --> 00:20:31,162
并没有发生
that it was fiction,

377
00:20:31,233 --> 00:20:33,250
可是究竟发生了什么?
but what did really happen?

378
00:21:03,354 --> 00:21:05,193
当我走到岩架
When I reached the ledge

379
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:06,965
我站在峭壁边
I stood at bay.

380
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:08,537
他并没有掏出武器
He drew no weapon,

381
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:10,306
而是冲了过来
but rushed at me

382
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:13,124
用他颀长的胳膊抱住我
and threw his long arms around me.

383
00:21:13,202 --> 00:21:14,696
他知道一切都完了
He knew that his game was up.

384
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:18,697
只急着报复我
He was only anxious to revenge himself upon me.

385
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:22,070
但是 我懂得一些日式摔跤
I have, however, some knowledge of baritsu,

386
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,092
或者说是柔道
or the Japanese system of wrestling,

387
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,826
过去好几次我都用上了这一手
which has on more than one occasion,

388
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:28,645
非常管用
been very useful to me.

389
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:34,698
天啊
My God.

390
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:39,086
可是...你是怎么从那里逃生的?
But... but how did you get away from that place?

391
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:41,761
那可不是件让人高兴的事
It was not a pleasant business.

392
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,529
就在莫里亚蒂掉进深渊时
Even as Professor Moriarty disappeared into oblivion

393
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:55,069
我突然想到命运给我安排了绝佳的机会
it struck me what an extraordinary lucky chance

394
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:57,464
安全近在眼前
Fate had placed in my way.

395
00:21:57,539 --> 00:21:59,199
但我知道至少
I knew that at least

396
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,329
还有一个莫里亚蒂的余党
one of Moriarty's henchmen

397
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,902
想置我于死地
would seek my demise now.

398
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:05,778
这念头因为他们主人的死
With even keener determination

399
00:22:05,854 --> 00:22:07,313
变得更加强烈
to revenge their dead leader

400
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:08,917
我想最好让全世界都相信
but if I could convince the world

401
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:11,063
我也一同丧命
that I too was dead,

402
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:17,198
所以我决定
so I decided

403
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,800
消失
to disappear

404
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,540
就在那一瞬间的决定
then and there.

405
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:25,095
老天爷啊
Heavens above.

406
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:27,260
但那些足迹呢? 福尔摩斯
But the tracks Holmes?

407
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:30,082
我亲眼所见
I saw them with my own eyes.

408
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:32,590
两个人的足迹通往下面 没有回来的
Two went down the path and none returned.

409
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,465
我不是个富于幻想的人 华生
I'm not a fanciful person Watson,

410
00:22:44,008 --> 00:22:45,145
但一点不假
but I give you my word

411
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:49,494
好几次 当我往上爬时
there were times during that climb

412
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:52,869
仿佛听见莫里亚蒂的声音
when I seemed to hear Moriarty's voice

413
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:54,333
从深渊中
screaming at me

414
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,388
冲我喊叫
from out of the abyss.

415
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:38,887
最后 我爬到了一个地方
At last I reached a place

416
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:42,021
没有被人发现
where I was able to remain unseen.

417
00:24:06,023 --> 00:24:07,374
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

418
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,613
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

419
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:15,022
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

420
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,059
在那个隐蔽的地方
From my concealed place

421
00:25:07,134 --> 00:25:09,420
我看着你们
I watched you and your followers

422
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:12,308
充满怜惜
investigate in the most sympathetic

423
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,878
却毫无效率地勘察
and inefficient manner

424
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,546
我丧生之地的环境
the circumstances of my death.

425
00:25:20,697 --> 00:25:23,721
最终你们都意见统一
At last, when you had all formed your

426
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:26,638
做出了完全错误的判断
inevitable but totally erroneous conclusions,

427
00:25:26,714 --> 00:25:28,481
然后你离开了
you departed.

428
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,731
是该上路的时候了
It was time for me to be on my way.

429
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:58,185
当然 这意味着什么就很清楚了
Of course, the meaning of this was obvious.

430
00:26:58,258 --> 00:27:00,890
莫里亚蒂不是一个人来的
Moriarty had not been alone.

431
00:27:00,972 --> 00:27:03,153
他的一个余党
A confederate

432
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:05,378
在远处目睹了
from a distance had been witness

433
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,613
他朋友的灭亡和我的逃脱
to his friend's demise and my escape.

434
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:19,608
我的思考没有耽搁多少时间 华生
I did not take long to think about it, Watson.

435
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:21,379
我拼命的跑
I took to my heels

436
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,226
在山里摸黑前进
and covered ten miles

437
00:27:23,302 --> 00:27:25,661
逃出了十英里
over the mountains in the pending darkness.

438
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,946
一周后
A week later

439
00:27:35,024 --> 00:27:37,975
我到了佛罗伦萨
I found myself in Florence,

440
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,152
确定这世上
with the certainty that

441
00:27:39,231 --> 00:27:40,547
没有人
no one in the world

442
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,124
知道我的下落
knew what had become of me.

443
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:48,757
我只有一个可以信赖的人
I had one confidant-

444
00:27:48,831 --> 00:27:50,491
我哥哥迈克罗夫特
my brother Mycroft.

445
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,028
我必须告诉他这事
I had to confide in him

446
00:27:52,101 --> 00:27:54,946
为了得到我需要的钱
in order to obtain the money I needed to live.

447
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:57,073
当然
Of course.

448
00:27:57,144 --> 00:28:00,297
我得再三向你道歉 华生
I owe you many apologies, my dear Watson,

449
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:01,516
但是当时最重要的是
but it was all-important

450
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:03,883
让人们相信我已经死了
that it should be thought I was dead,

451
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,727
你要是不相信我死了
and it is quite certain that you would

452
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:07,296
也肯定写不出一篇令人信服的
not have written so convincing an account

453
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:08,992
关于我不幸结局的
of my unhappy end

454
00:28:09,073 --> 00:28:13,412
感人故事来
had you yourself not thought that it was true.

455
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:15,292
我几次要提笔写信给你
I have taken up my pen to write to you,

456
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:19,674
但总害怕
but always I feared

457
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,003
你对我的深切关心
lest your affectionate regard

458
00:28:22,082 --> 00:28:23,540
会让你不慎
might tempt you to some indiscretion,

459
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:25,271
泄露秘密
which would betray my secret.

460
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,662
我还以为
I would have thought

461
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:36,471
我和你哥哥一样值得信任呢
I was as trustworthy as your brother.

462
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,917
你当然是 华生...
Of course you are Watson...

463
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:46,947
但是你更加善良
but you have a kinder heart.

464
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,731
可是你这些年都在做什么
But what have you done all these long years?

465
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:54,975
你也许看到过
As you may have read

466
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:56,477
一位名叫西格森的
of the remarkable explorations

467
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:00,651
挪威探险家的考察报告
of a Norwegian called Sigerson,

468
00:29:00,723 --> 00:29:02,454
但我保证你从没有想到过
but I am sure that it never occurred to you

469
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,061
你看到的
that you were receiving

470
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:05,483
是你朋友的见闻
news of your friend.

471
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:06,837
是你
You?

472
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:09,620
我在西藏
For two years I traveled

473
00:29:09,698 --> 00:29:11,713
游历了两年
to Tibet

474
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:13,835
常以去拉萨
and amused myself by visiting Lhasa

475
00:29:13,907 --> 00:29:17,309
和大喇嘛聊天消磨时光为乐
and spending some time with the head Lama.

476
00:29:17,384 --> 00:29:19,779
之后我又去了波斯
I then moved to Persia,

477
00:29:19,853 --> 00:29:22,390
到喀土穆(苏丹首都)对哈里法(伊斯兰教国家领袖)
and paid a short but interesting visit

478
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,758
做了简短而有趣的拜访
to the Khalifa in Khartoum,

479
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,423
并把拜访的结果
the results of which I have passed on

480
00:29:27,505 --> 00:29:29,094
交给外交部的凯彻姆部长
to Lord Ketchum in the Foreign Office,

481
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,461
当然 是匿名
anonymously of course.

482
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,927
你是说你亲眼见到了皇宫
You mean you actually saw the palace

483
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:35,217
戈登被谋杀的地方
where Gordon was murdered?

484
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:39,221
凄惨的场景
It was a sorry sight.

485
00:29:39,296 --> 00:29:43,044
他的血还残留在夹克上
His blood still upon his jacket.

486
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:46,907
最近我去了法国蒙特利尔
Lately I've been in France in Montpellier,

487
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:51,738
研究煤焦油的衍生物
to research the coal tar derivatives.

488
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:56,085
这时候发生了这件惊人的谋杀案
Then came the news of this remarkable murder,

489
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:59,189
案件的离奇吸引了我
which not only appealed to my by its own merits,

490
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:03,114
似乎给我个人带来了
but would seem to offer some most peculiar

491
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:07,258
最难得的机会
personal opportunities.

492
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:09,201
我立刻回到这里
So here I am.

493
00:30:09,277 --> 00:30:10,486
你来过贝克街
Have you been to Baker Street?

494
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:11,702
是的
Yes.

495
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:14,211
今天早上 我自己打了个电话回去
I called there this morning in my own person.

496
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,823
迈克罗夫特把我屋子
Mycroft had preserved my rooms

497
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:13,505
和文件原模原样保存着
and my papers exactly as they had always been.

498
00:31:28,926 --> 00:31:29,934
就这样
So it was,

499
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,012
我发现自己
that I found myself

500
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:32,813
回到了我的老房间里
in my old rooms,

501
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,072
坐在原来的椅子上
sitting in my old chair,

502
00:31:35,151 --> 00:31:36,573
满心希望能见到
and only wishing that I could have seen

503
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,148
我的老朋友 华生
my dear friend, Watson

504
00:31:39,221 --> 00:31:40,465
也坐在对面的
sitting in the other chair

505
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:42,309
他一向常坐的椅子上
which he has so often adorned.

506
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:45,412
我正是这样希望的
And so I hope I will be.

507
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:48,742
多么值得非凡的故事啊
What... what a remarkable story.

508
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:54,342
你的左轮手枪
Are you still in possession

509
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:56,188
还在吗?
of your Army revolver?

510
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,067
应该还在
Well I think I have it somewhere.

511
00:31:58,143 --> 00:32:00,431
确保你晚上带在身上
See that you bring it with you tonight.

512
00:32:02,143 --> 00:32:04,158
我给咱俩安排了一点工作
I have piece of work for both of us

513
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,446
如果咱们能成功的
which if we bring to a successful conclusion,

514
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,096
结束它
will in itself

515
00:32:09,168 --> 00:32:13,437
就不枉活在世上
justify a man's life on this planet.

516
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,626
求求你讲详细点
I beg you to tell me about it.

517
00:32:15,707 --> 00:32:18,587
天亮前够你听和看的了
You will see and hear enough before morning.

518
00:32:22,488 --> 00:32:24,017
华生
Watson?

519
00:32:24,088 --> 00:32:26,625
我能占用一会儿你的病床吗
May I occupy your couch for a few hours?

520
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,119
海上的航行极其艰苦
The sea was exceeding rough

521
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:29,544
穿过海峡时
during the channel crossing

522
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,156
又一次看到伦敦
and the prospect of seeing London again

523
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:33,578
还要和一个莫里亚蒂的余党
and an intimate encounter

524
00:32:33,653 --> 00:32:35,313
进行一场激烈的决斗
with one of Moriarty's confederates

525
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:37,053
加上将要看到
plus the added pleasure

526
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,829
老朋友华生的兴奋
of seeing my old friend Watson

527
00:32:38,906 --> 00:32:40,185
而之后在火车上
quite prohibited sleep

528
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,614
辗转反侧难以入眠
on the railway train.

529
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:42,519
亲爱的 福尔摩斯 拜托
My dear Holmes, please,

530
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:44,251
你可以睡我的床啊
my bedroom is at your disposal.

531
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:45,611
不 不 不
No, No, No.

532
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:48,711
这个挺舒服的
This will suit me very well.

533
00:32:48,784 --> 00:32:50,100
过去的几年里
I've had harder beds than this

534
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:52,083
我睡过比着还硬的床呢
over the past few years.

535
00:35:30,343 --> 00:35:32,603
知道我们在哪吗?
Do you know where we are?

536
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:34,124
当然 那是贝克街
Surely that is Baker Street.

537
00:35:34,203 --> 00:35:35,626
说对了
Exactly.

538
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,050
但这间空屋
But in the empty house

539
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,141
正对着我们的房子
opposite our old quarters.

540
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:40,765
为什么要来这里?
Why are we here?

541
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,304
因为从这里可以清楚的
Because it commands such an excellent a view

542
00:35:42,376 --> 00:35:45,045
看到对面的楼
of that picturesque pile.

543
00:35:45,124 --> 00:35:46,582
麻烦你 华生
Might I trouble you, Watson, to be so kind

544
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:48,278
靠窗户近一点
as to draw a little nearer to the window,

545
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,646
小心别暴露自己
taking every precaution not to reveal yourself,

546
00:35:50,724 --> 00:35:53,427
再看看我们的房间?
and then to look into our old rooms?

547
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:55,308
让咱们看看我离开这三年
Let us see where the three years of absence

548
00:35:55,385 --> 00:35:58,124
是不是完全失去了
have entirely taken away my power

549
00:35:58,202 --> 00:36:00,253
让你惊奇的能力
to surprise you.

550
00:36:23,627 --> 00:36:25,951
天哪!
Good heavens!

551
00:36:26,027 --> 00:36:27,971
妙极了
It's marvelous.

552
00:36:31,974 --> 00:36:35,091
我相信我变化多端的手法尚未因
I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale

553
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,878
岁月流逝而枯竭
my infinite variety.

554
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:39,544
的确有几分像我 是不是?
It is rather like me, is it not?

555
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:41,570
我可以发誓说那就是你
I should be prepared to swear it was you.

556
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:42,995
功劳归于
The construction is due to

557
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,456
格勒诺布尔的
a Monsieur Oscar Meunier,

558
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:45,919
奥斯卡莫尼埃先生
of Grenoble.

559
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:47,722
那是一座蜡像
The bust is in wax.

560
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,044
其余是今天下午
The rest I arranged

561
00:36:49,121 --> 00:36:51,694
我在贝克街自己布置的
during my visit to Baker Street earlier.

562
00:36:52,222 --> 00:36:53,672
但是为什么?
But why?

563
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,082
因为我有最大的必要
Because I have the strongest possible reason

564
00:36:57,156 --> 00:36:58,436
让某些人相信
for wishing certain people to believe

565
00:36:58,512 --> 00:37:00,042
我在那
that I was there

566
00:37:00,114 --> 00:37:02,022
其实我并不在那
when I was really elsewhere.

567
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:03,863
你认为有人在监视你的房子?
You thought the rooms were watched?

568
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,129
我知道有人在监视
I knew that they were being watched.

569
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:09,117
是谁?
By whom?

570
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:10,542
那可爱的一帮人里
By the one remaining member

571
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,075
仅剩的一位宿敌
of that charming society

572
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:15,408
他们的头子此刻正躺在莱辛巴赫瀑布下面
whose leader lies in the Reichenbach Falls.

573
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:18,754
他相信早晚
Sooner or later he believed

574
00:37:18,826 --> 00:37:20,319
我会回来的
that I would come back to my rooms.

575
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,298
所以派人不断进行监视
So he had them watched continuously.

576
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,622
今早他们看到我到达伦敦
I was observed when I arrived this morning.

577
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,535
我看到了放哨的人
I recognized the sentinel.

578
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:42,123
姓巴克尔
Parker by name,

579
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:44,485
以杀人抢劫为生
a garrotter by trade,

580
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:47,587
是个出色的犹太口琴演奏家
and a remarkable expert Upon the jew's-harp.

581
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,959
现在我明白
Now I understand the reason

582
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,977
你为什么要扮成老书商了
for the old bookseller.

583
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:03,136
我不在乎巴克尔
I cared not about Parker

584
00:38:03,206 --> 00:38:04,594
但我非常担心
but I care a great deal about

585
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:06,327
他背后那个
the much more formable person

586
00:38:06,407 --> 00:38:09,145
更加难对付的人
who is behind him,

587
00:38:09,224 --> 00:38:12,140
莫里亚蒂的把兄弟
the bosom friend of Moriarty.

588
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:20,343
今晚在追我的正好是他
That is the man who is after me tonight

589
00:38:20,422 --> 00:38:22,330
但我们相信
and let us hope that he is also the man

590
00:38:22,405 --> 00:38:23,757
他并不清楚
who is totally unaware

591
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:26,949
其实是我们在追他
that we are after him.

592
00:38:57,759 --> 00:38:59,103
福尔摩斯
Holmes

593
00:38:59,678 --> 00:39:01,048
看!
look!

594
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:07,268
就在楼那边
Just beyond the house.

595
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:11,851
门口那两个人影
Couple of shady characters in the doorway.

596
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,426
是的 我看到了
Yes I see them.

597
00:39:13,499 --> 00:39:14,506
我们是不是该做点什么?
Well shouldn't we do something?

598
00:39:14,576 --> 00:39:15,891
不
No.

599
00:39:18,158 --> 00:39:20,174
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

600
00:39:20,246 --> 00:39:22,712
影子动了
the shadow's moved.

601
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,966
当然会动
Certainly it has moved.

602
00:39:25,046 --> 00:39:26,847
我让哈德森太太这么做的
I involved Mrs. Hudson.

603
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:29,175
我们在这里待了两个小时
We have been in this room two hours

604
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:31,126
她已经把蜡像的位置
and she has made some change

605
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,731
变动八次了
in that figure eight times,

606
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,569
每一刻钟换一次
or once every quarter.

607
00:43:05,663 --> 00:43:07,394
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

608
00:43:08,899 --> 00:43:10,735
雷斯垂德 见到你太高兴了
Lestrade how nice to see you.

609
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:12,719
真的是你?
So it really is you?

610
00:43:12,794 --> 00:43:13,729
我接到你的信时
When I received your message

611
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,461
几乎不敢相信
I could scarce believe it.

612
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:17,937
我觉得你需要点非官方的帮助
You seem to want some unofficial help.

613
00:43:18,011 --> 00:43:19,670
一年中有三起谋杀案
Three undetected murders in one year

614
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,137
破不了是不行的
won't do you know.

615
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,454
福尔摩斯 我认识这个人
Holmes I know this man.

616
00:43:22,531 --> 00:43:23,705
你当然认识 华生
Of course you do Watson.

617
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,063
警探先生也认识
So does the Inspector.

618
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:28,852
赛巴斯蒂恩・莫兰上校
Colonel Sebastian Moran,

619
00:43:28,932 --> 00:43:31,114
以前在女王陛下的印度军中效力
once of Her Majesty's Indian Army,

620
00:43:31,193 --> 00:43:32,722
咱们东方帝国造就的
and the best heavy game shot

621
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:35,850
最优秀的射手
our Eastern Empire has ever produced.

622
00:43:35,922 --> 00:43:37,310
我相信我说的没错吧 上校
I believe I'm correct, Colonel,

623
00:43:37,384 --> 00:43:38,913
你的猎虎绝技
in saying that your bag of tigers

624
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:41,307
仍然是举国无双吧?
still remain unrivalled?

625
00:43:41,382 --> 00:43:43,493
奇怪 我这么简单的计策
I wonder that my simple stratagem

626
00:43:43,574 --> 00:43:46,313
就能让一个老狐狸上当
could deceive so old a shikari.

627
00:43:48,096 --> 00:43:50,563
你不是也经常
How many times have you not tethered

628
00:43:50,636 --> 00:43:52,651
在一棵树下栓只小羊
a young kid under a tree,

629
00:43:52,722 --> 00:43:54,704
自己带着来复枪躲在树上
laid above it with your rifle,

630
00:43:54,775 --> 00:43:56,127
等着你的诱饵
and waited for your bait

631
00:43:56,201 --> 00:43:58,346
把老虎引来吗?
to bring up your tiger?

632
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,902
这间空屋就是我的树
This empty house is my tree,

633
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,546
你就是我的猎物!
and you're my tiger!

634
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:09,861
同样的方法
The parallel is exact.

635
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,291
你可能有或者没有
You may or may not

636
00:44:11,366 --> 00:44:13,902
逮捕我的正当理由
have just cause for arresting me

637
00:44:13,973 --> 00:44:15,396
但至少没有理由
but there can be no reason

638
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,307
让我受到
why I should be subjected

639
00:44:17,382 --> 00:44:19,432
这个人的嘲弄
to the jives of this person.

640
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:20,891
如果我现在在法律掌握中
If I'm in the hands of the law

641
00:44:20,964 --> 00:44:23,108
都一切照法律办吧
let things be done in a legal way.

642
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:25,999
你说的倒是很合理
Well that sounds reasonable.

643
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:28,992
走之前 你还有什么要讲的吗?
Anything further to say before we go?

644
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:30,976
只有一个问题
Only to ask

645
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:33,861
你要以什么罪名提出控告?
what charge you intend to prefer?

646
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,491
什么罪名 先生?
What charge sir?

647
00:44:35,571 --> 00:44:37,552
当然是企图谋杀
Why of course the attempted murder of

648
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,177
福尔摩斯夏洛克先生了
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

649
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,883
这不成 雷斯垂德
Not so Lestrade.

650
00:44:40,963 --> 00:44:43,322
这么出色的逮捕是你的功劳
To you, and to you only, belongs the credit

651
00:44:43,398 --> 00:44:45,793
只属于你一个人的功劳
of this remarkable arrest.

652
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:48,928
以你惯有的智勇双全
With your usual mixture of cunning and audacity

653
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:51,570
逮到了他
and you have got him.

654
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:54,974
我不明白 福尔摩斯先生
I don't understand you Mr. Holmes.

655
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,002
抓住了谁?
Do you mean this man?

656
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:00,020
这就是整个警局
The man whom the entire police force

657
00:45:00,094 --> 00:45:02,144
一直都没有找到的
has been seeking in vain

658
00:45:02,215 --> 00:45:04,326
赛巴斯蒂恩・莫兰上校
Colonel Sebastian Moran,

659
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:05,721
是他杀害了年轻的阿德尔
who shot the young Adair

660
00:45:05,798 --> 00:45:07,385
上个月20号在阿德尔父母的房子外
through the open window of his parent's house

661
00:45:07,467 --> 00:45:09,649
透过敞开的窗户射杀了他
upon the twentieth of last month.

662
00:45:09,727 --> 00:45:13,177
这就是罪名 雷斯垂德
That is your charge Lestrade.

663
00:45:15,431 --> 00:45:18,292
你真是这个案子的女英雄 哈德森太太
You were quite the heron of the occasion, Mrs. Hudson.

664
00:45:18,422 --> 00:45:21,584
可能是因为我很矮吧
Why I don't know, I'm short.

665
00:45:21,657 --> 00:45:23,565
一切预防措施你都遵守了吗?
I hope you have preserved all precautions?

666
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,610
是的 先生
Oh yes sir.

667
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:25,820
我跪在地上爬过去
I went to it on my knees

668
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:27,808
就像你告诉我的一样
just exactly as you told me

669
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:30,455
我背上的疼痛可以证明
and a good crick in my back to prove it.

670
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,922
我害怕极了 医生
Oh I was frightened Doctor

671
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,532
当窗户碎掉的时候
and when that window shattered

672
00:45:35,604 --> 00:45:38,176
我以为我要死了
I thought I should have died.

673
00:45:38,247 --> 00:45:41,616
你做的棒极了 哈德森太太
Yes you did it very well Mrs. Hudson.

674
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:44,016
没有子弹的影子
There's no sign of the bullet.

675
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:46,344
抱歉 先生
Excuse me sir,

676
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,994
帮我拿一下
a moment if you please.

677
00:45:49,065 --> 00:45:51,770
什么事?
What is it?

678
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:53,922
子弹在我这儿
I have it here.

679
00:45:54,005 --> 00:45:56,115
我从地毯上捡起来的
I picked it up off the carpet.

680
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:58,555
你真是帮了大忙
Mrs. Hudson you are becoming indispensable.

681
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:08,950
一个软弹头铅弹
A soft revolver bullet,

682
00:46:10,665 --> 00:46:11,909
正如你们所见
as you perceive,

683
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:14,096
多么巧妙啊
there's genius in that

684
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:17,894
谁会想到
for who would expect such a thing

685
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:20,687
这会是从一把气枪里射出的?
to be fired from an air gun?

686
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,223
这可不是一把普通的气枪
It's no ordinary air gun.

687
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:22,859
绝对不是
No indeed.

688
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,991
非凡而独一无二的武器
Remarkable and unique weapon.

689
00:46:25,063 --> 00:46:27,137
威力巨大却没有声音
Noiseless and of tremendous power

690
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:28,534
我认识这个・范哈德
I knew Von Herder

691
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:30,827
盲眼的德国技工
the blind German mechanic

692
00:46:30,906 --> 00:46:32,779
这把枪是他给
who constructed it to the order of

693
00:46:32,855 --> 00:46:36,400
莫里亚蒂教授特制的
the late Professor James Moriarty.

694
00:46:36,471 --> 00:46:38,724
华生 看啊
Watson look at this.

695
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:40,390
老猎人居然
The old shilkaris nerves

696
00:46:40,472 --> 00:46:41,859
还手不抖
had not lost their steadiness

697
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:43,425
眼也不花
nor his eyes their keenness.

698
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:44,920
惊人的准头
The results are appalling.

699
00:46:44,993 --> 00:46:46,308
是的
Yes indeed.

700
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:49,745
在阿德尔被谋杀前
Have you heard of the name Moran

701
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:51,357
你听过莫兰这个名字吗?
before Adairs murder?

702
00:46:51,427 --> 00:46:52,458
没听过
No I had not.

703
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:54,522
是啊 是啊 是啊
Well, well, well,

704
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:56,015
这就叫出名
such is the price of fame.

705
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:57,262
请你从书架上
Would you be so kind to hand me

706
00:46:57,341 --> 00:46:59,557
把L到M开头的
on my L-M index?

707
00:46:59,636 --> 00:47:02,066
传记索引拿来?
Our biographies Watson?

708
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,633
我收集的M部分材料很不错
My list of M's is a fine one.

709
00:47:03,706 --> 00:47:05,472
莫里亚蒂这个名字不论在哪
Mind you Moriarty's name is enough to make

710
00:47:05,549 --> 00:47:08,015
都是最出众的
any letter illustrious.

711
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:10,482
我记得好像还有
I seem to remember

712
00:47:10,557 --> 00:47:13,783
投毒犯摩根
Morgan the poisonner.

713
00:47:13,861 --> 00:47:15,734
遗臭万年的梅里丢
Merridew an abominable memory.

714
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,398
还有马修斯
And there was Mathews,

715
00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:19,624
他在查林十字车站
who knocked out my left canine

716
00:47:19,705 --> 00:47:21,992
打掉了我的左犬牙
in Charing Cross Station.

717
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:26,059
最后是我们昨晚见到的老朋友
Awe there is our friend of last night.

718
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,471
赛巴蒂斯恩・莫兰上校
'Moran, Sebastian, Colonel.

719
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:31,041
原系英国驻波斯公使
Son of Sir Augustus Moran,

720
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:32,501
奥古斯都・莫兰爵士之子
once British Minister to Persia.

721
00:47:32,574 --> 00:47:34,518
曾就学于伊顿公学 牛津大学
Educated Eton, Oxford.

722
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,216
参加过乔瓦基和阿富汗战役
Served in Jowaki Campaign,

723
00:47:36,296 --> 00:47:39,175
在舍普尔 喀布尔
Afghan Campaign, Sherpur, Cabul

724
00:47:39,252 --> 00:47:42,691
服过役
mention to dispatches.

725
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:46,404
伦敦第二号最危险人物
The second most dangerous man in London.'

726
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:47,731
真叫人惊奇 福尔摩斯
This is astonishing Holmes.

727
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:49,790
这人还是个体面的军人呢
This is the career of an honorable soldier.

728
00:47:49,861 --> 00:47:51,627
确实是的
It's true.

729
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:53,292
他在一定程度上干得不错
Up to a certain point he did well

730
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:56,362
但是有一些树
yet there are some trees, Watson,

731
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:57,749
在长到一定高度时
which grow to a certain height

732
00:47:57,824 --> 00:47:59,176
会突然长成
and then suddenly develop

733
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,744
难看的古怪形状
some unsightly eccentricity.

734
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:03,662
这一点常常会在人身上看到
You will often find it in humans.

735
00:48:03,738 --> 00:48:04,805
不管出于什么原因
Whatever the cause,

736
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:07,237
莫兰开始堕落
Moran began to go wrong.

737
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:09,365
虽然没有什么丑闻  
Without an open scandal,

738
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:11,435
但仍然在印度呆不下去
he still made India too hot to hold him.

739
00:48:11,624 --> 00:48:12,461
他退伍了 回到伦敦
He retired, came back to London

740
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:14,411
又弄得声名狼藉
but again he acquired an evil name.

741
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:16,323
这时候
It was about this time

742
00:48:16,399 --> 00:48:20,196
他被莫里亚蒂教授看中了
that he was sought out by Professor Moriarty.

743
00:48:20,378 --> 00:48:22,339
在瑞士时 华生
When you were in Switzerland, Watson,

744
00:48:22,415 --> 00:48:25,998
莫兰和莫里亚蒂一直跟着我们
Moran followed us with Moriarty

745
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,419
毫无疑问
and it was undoubtedly he

746
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:29,023
是他给了我莱辛巴赫悬崖上
who gave me those evil five minutes

747
00:48:29,093 --> 00:48:31,205
那不愉快的五分钟
above the Reichenbach Falls.

748
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,328
现在我明白你为什么要消失了
Well now I can understand why you disappeared.

749
00:48:33,406 --> 00:48:36,774
有这么一个自由的危险人物
With a fellow like this, free in London,

750
00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:39,553
很可能性命不保
your life would not have been worth living.

751
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:42,857
我所能做的就是等待
All I could do was wait

752
00:48:42,936 --> 00:48:45,218
并留意犯罪新闻
and watch the criminal news

753
00:48:45,283 --> 00:48:46,794
我知道如果耐心等待
knowing that if I was patient

754
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:48,949
他早晚会露出破绽
sooner or later he would make a mistake.

755
00:48:49,023 --> 00:48:51,310
当我听到罗纳德・阿德尔被谋杀的事
When I heard of the murder of Ronald Adair

756
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:54,377
我知道我的机会来了
I knew that at last my chance had come.

757
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:57,293
我确定
Knowing what I did

758
00:48:57,371 --> 00:48:58,722
这明摆着
was it not certain

759
00:48:58,796 --> 00:49:00,598
是莫兰上校干的
that Colonel Moran had done it.

760
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:04,776
他先和这个年轻人打牌
He played cards with the lad

761
00:49:04,848 --> 00:49:06,615
随后从俱乐部跟踪他到家里
followed him home from his club

762
00:49:06,691 --> 00:49:09,502
从开着的窗户
and shot him

763
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,966
射杀了他
through the open window

764
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,399
就在对面的房顶上
from the rooftop opposite.

765
00:49:13,475 --> 00:49:14,754
华生还有什么
Watson does anything else

766
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,118
需要我解释的吗?
remain for me to explain?

767
00:49:17,196 --> 00:49:19,069
是的
Yes.

768
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:25,121
你还没说清楚
You have not made clear

769
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:27,520
莫兰谋杀
what was Moran's motive

770
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:30,619
罗诺德・阿德尔的动机是什么
in murdering the Honorable Ronald Adair.

771
00:49:33,717 --> 00:49:37,499
这一点我们只能推测了
There we move into the realms of conjecture.

772
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:39,070
各人可以根据证据做出
Each may form his own hypothesis

773
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,495
他自己的假设
upon the present evidence,

774
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:44,079
而你我的假设都有可能是正确的
and yours is as likely to be correct as mine.

775
00:49:44,152 --> 00:49:46,855
华生 你已经有假设了?
Watson have you formed one?

776
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:51,896
我想是的
I think so.

777
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:53,328
让我听听
Let me hear.

778
00:49:53,403 --> 00:49:55,762
我想说明案件的事实并不难
Well it's not difficult to explain the facts.

779
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:57,083
本案显然是
There must have been

780
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,652
牵涉到一笔可观的金钱
a considerable amount of money involved

781
00:49:58,725 --> 00:50:00,802
莫兰作了弊
and Moran had undoubtedly played foul.

782
00:50:00,882 --> 00:50:02,861
我想阿德尔发现了
I think that Adair had discovered

783
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:04,356
莫兰在作弊
that he was cheating.

784
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:05,638
非常好
Splendid.

785
00:50:05,715 --> 00:50:07,103
很可能他私下跟莫兰谈过
Very likely he spoke to him privately

786
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:09,157
还恐吓要揭发莫兰
and threatened to expose Moran unless he

787
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:11,659
除非他自动退出俱乐部
voluntarily resigned membership in his club

788
00:50:11,734 --> 00:50:13,808
并答应从此不再打牌
and promised not to play again.

789
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:16,142
华生 太棒了
Watson this is excellent.

790
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,536
开除出俱乐部
Exclusion from his club

791
00:50:17,612 --> 00:50:20,279
就等于毁掉了
would mean ruin to Moran,

792
00:50:20,359 --> 00:50:23,832
靠打牌骗钱为生的莫兰
who lived by his ill-gotten card gains.

793
00:50:25,262 --> 00:50:27,064
因此
Therefore,

794
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,578
他杀了阿德尔
he murdered Adair.

795
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,977
这样可以吗?
Will it pass?

796
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:35,898
毫无疑问
I think, without doubt,

797
00:50:35,974 --> 00:50:38,119
你说到点子上了
that you have hit upon the truth.

798
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,446
这会在审讯时得到证明
Anyway it will be verified

799
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:40,660
或是遭到反驳
or disproved at the trial.

800
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:42,162
同时 不论再发生什么
Meanwhile, come what may,

801
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:47,583
