非常感谢 先生 多施舍一点...

你是个好人
You're a gentlemen,

8
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:11,876
十全十美的大好人
a very perfect gentle Knight.

9

祝你们日安 先生们
Good day you all sir.

谢谢你 先生

多施舍点吧
Oh filling my cup running over.

12
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,037
愿你的善良人人皆知
May your sweetness never blush unseen

13
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,759
我感激不尽 先生
My gratitude knows no bounds sir.

14
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:29,878
我是你们的奴仆 衰弱且卑贱
Here I sit your slave weak and despised.

15
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:32,064
威廉・莎士比亚
William Shakespeare.

16
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:34,852
哦 是啊 我在那儿 他也是...
Oh yeah, i was there.And so was he..

17
00:01:35,664 --> 00:01:38,947
有福的人是精神上的贫乏者 先生
Blessed are the poor in spirit, sir.

18
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:49,475
有福的人是精神上的贫乏者
Blessed are the poor in spirit

19
00:01:51,008 --> 00:01:54,739
因为你们的是天国 先生(出自汤姆历险记一书)
for yours is the kingdom of heaven sir.

20
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,595
<font color="#4096d1">歪唇男人
The man with the twisted lip</font>

21
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:47,011
帮帮忙吧!救命!不要!
Help!Help!Help!Please!

22
00:02:47,278 --> 00:02:49,998
但我们半个月前就安排好了
But we arranged it two weeks ago.

23
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:52,447
在我的俱乐部用晚餐
We were to have supper at my club.

24
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:53,750
是的
Yes.

25
00:02:53,918 --> 00:02:56,034
他今天早上还跟我提过
He did mention it to me this morning.

26
00:02:56,263 --> 00:02:58,940
就在一位女士来电前
It was just before the lady called.

27
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,035
女士?
Lady?

28
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:01,256
哪位女士?
Which lady?

29
00:03:01,371 --> 00:03:03,439
我不知道她的名字
Well I don't know her name

30
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:06,786
但那位女士来电后福尔摩斯先生就出去了
but the lady called and Mr. Holmes went out.

31
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,128
既然那样 我得好好利用这个晚上
In that case I shall have take advantage of an early night.

32
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,610
我得去开门了
I must answer the door.

33
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:15,652
当然
Of course.

34
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:17,362
可能会有点线索
Might be a clue.

35
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,999
希望我没有打扰你们
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

36
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,080
他肯定不会在意的
Oh he won't mind I'm sure,

37
00:03:32,164 --> 00:03:34,134
他心肠最好了
he's the kindest of men.

38
00:03:35,062 --> 00:03:36,969
惠特尼太太想见你 医生
Mrs. Whitney to see you Doctor.

39
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:43,505
凯特 真让人意外
Kate, this is a surprise.

40
00:03:44,787 --> 00:03:47,158
不让人愉快的意外 约翰
Not a pleasant one I fear John.

41
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,998
谢谢 赫德森太太
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

42
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,166
来点茶吧
Perhaps some tea.

43
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:51,730
太感谢了
That would be most welcome.

44
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,418
请原谅我带来这么多麻烦
You must forgive me for causing so much trouble...

45
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,441
一点也不麻烦 请坐
You're causing us no trouble at all, please.

46
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,673
你的助手告诉我
Your assistant told me

47
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,663
你在和福尔摩斯先生共进晚餐
that you were dining with Mr. Holmes.

48
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,425
你到诊所去了
Oh I see you've been to the surgery.

49
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,644
就在你刚离开的时候
And you had just left.

50
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:06,334
正如你所见 福尔摩斯先生
Well Mr. Holmes has disappeared without trace

51
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,470
不知道去哪了
as you can see.

52
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,470
既然如此
In that case,

53
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,681
我就更不该麻烦你了
I really shouldn't bother you with my problems.

54
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:13,829
每隔一段时间 福尔摩斯先生
Oh Mr. Holmes disappears without trace

55
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,080
就会销声匿迹一次
at regular intervals.

56
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,799
大可不必担心
There's really no cause for alarm,

57
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,925
好奇倒会有点
only curiosity.

58
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:22,751
但你为什么想见我呢?
But why did you want to see me?

59
00:04:22,835 --> 00:04:23,721
如果你病了
If you're ill

60
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:25,399
不该穿过整个伦敦来这里
you should not be traveling across London.

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,515
我没生病
I am not ill.

62
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:30,559
是艾萨
It's Isa.

63
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,993
如果艾萨病了 我可以去你家拜访他
Well if Isa is ill I can visit him at home.

64
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,242
他不在家
He's not at home.

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,588
他也人间蒸发了?
He too has disappeared without trace?

66
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,247
你应该能猜到他在干什么
You can probably guess what he's doing.

67
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:48,364
我想他又沉迷于他的烟瘾中了
I imagine he's indulging his addiction.

68
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:50,000
鸦片?
Opium?

69
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,201
恐怕是的
I fear so.

70
00:04:54,275 --> 00:04:56,693
这也不是第一次了吧?
Well he's done this before has he not?

71
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:58,276
是什么原因让这次
What makes this circumstance

72
00:04:58,277 --> 00:04:59,246
如此特别?
so very different?

73
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:04,729
通常他这种放纵
Well normally his orgies

74
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,106
都不会超过一天
are confined to one day.

75
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,379
他早上出门
He leaves the house in the morning

76
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:12,955
晚上就会回家
and returns in the evening,

77
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,435
苍白且非常虚弱
pale and shattered.

78
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,906
而这次呢?
And this time?

79
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,469
我已经有两天
I have not seen Isa

80
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,804
没见过艾萨了
for forty-eight hours.

81
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,089
你是否知道他
Well have you the remotest idea

82
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:28,059
可能去哪里了吗?
where he might be?

83
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:32,343
有一个房子
There is an establishment

84
00:05:32,427 --> 00:05:34,678
叫黄金酒馆
called the Bar of Gold

85
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:36,794
就在上天鹅闸巷
in Upper Swandam Lane,

86
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:38,670
我确信他在那里
I believe he is there

87
00:05:40,495 --> 00:05:42,183
但我不敢一个人去
but I dare not go there alone.

88
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:44,017
不 不 任何一个体面的女士
Oh no, no,no respectable woman

89
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,051
都不会只身走进那肮脏的小巷
would go within a hundred miles of that

90
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,635
百里的范围内
vile alley unaccompanied.

91
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:49,584
你愿意跟我一起去吗?
Will you come with me?

92
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:50,585
不      但...
No.        But...

93
00:05:51,336 --> 00:05:52,753
我将独自前往
No I shall go there on my own.

94
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:54,422
你先回家
You will go home

95
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:56,104
如果你的丈夫真的在你所想的那个地方
and if you're husband is where you think he is

96
00:05:56,263 --> 00:05:58,216
我保证在两小时内
I guarantee to have him back with you

97
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,238
他会回到你身边
within two hours.

98
00:05:59,384 --> 00:06:00,863
尽管我不敢想象
Though I dare not imagine

99
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,114
他届时的状况
what state he'll be in.

100
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:07,701
你的茶 医生
Your tea Doctor.

101
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,474
很抱歉 赫德森太太
My apologies Mrs. Hudson,

102
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:14,390
我不用茶了 我要出去了
I shall not require tea,I'm going out

103
00:06:14,728 --> 00:06:16,802
但惠特尼太太得来点茶
but Mrs. Whitney will take tea.

104
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,012
那福尔摩斯先生回来时
And what am I to tell Mr. Holmes

105
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,086
我该如何告诉他呢?
should he return?

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,806
就说我消失得无影无踪了
Tell him I've disappeared without trace.

107
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:30,937
麻烦你 车夫 到上天鹅闸巷
Upper Swandam Lane please cabbie.

108
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,560
我时常会思忖
I sometimes wonder

109
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:45,604
究竟男人是否会成熟
whether men ever truly grow up.

110
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:50,701
他们似乎永远都长不大
They seem to remain little boys forever.

111
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:55,590
赫德森太太 你有这样想过吗?
Do you wonder about that Mrs. Hudson?

112
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,168
没有 惠特尼太太
No, Mrs. Whitney.

113
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,342
我从不这样想
I don't wonder about it.

114
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:00,510
我早就知道
I know it

115
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:04,167
他们总是需要我们在事后抚慰他们
and they always need us to kiss them better afterwards,

116
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,045
当然 用言语抚慰
in a matter of speaking of course.

117
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:43,740
不用了 谢谢
No thank you.

118
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:44,969
我不会久留
I've not come here to stay.

119
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,241
我是来找一位朋友的
There's a friend of mine here.

120
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:54,081
我想找艾萨・惠特尼先生
I just wish to speak to Mr. Isa Whitney.

121
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:55,155
艾萨?
Isa?

122
00:09:57,418 --> 00:09:59,179
天啊
My God.

123
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:02,140
华生
Watson.

124
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,454
几点了?
What's the time?

125
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:06,810
十一点
It's eleven.

126
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,696
今天星期几?
What's the day?

127
00:10:09,572 --> 00:10:11,250
十九号 星期五
Friday the nineteenth.

128
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,867
我还以为是星期三呢
I thought it was Wednesday.

129
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,734
就是星期三
It is Wednesday.

130
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,747
你想吓唬我
You're trying to frighten me.

131
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:25,217
你的妻子已经在家
Your wife has been waiting for you

132
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:26,761
等你两天了
to return home for two days.

133
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,909
两天?
Two days?

134
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,024
不可能
Surely not.

135
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,798
几个小时吧
A few hours perhaps.

136
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:35,559
三管
Three pipes,

137
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:37,998
四管
four pipes,

138
00:10:38,176 --> 00:10:40,302
我不记得了
I forget.

139
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,796
外面有辆马车
I've got a cab outside

140
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,496
你现在就得回家!
you're going home now!

141
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:50,089
一定得回吗?
Must I?

142
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:53,635
如果你还在乎我们的友谊 你妻子的爱
If you value my friendship. Your wife's love

143
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,837
可怜的凯特
Oh poor Kate.

144
00:11:02,214 --> 00:11:03,569
走吧
Come on.

145
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,051
我还得付钱
I have to pay.

146
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,138
我还欠店主钱
I owe the manager money.

147
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,379
你不必为
You don't have to pay

148
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,765
你的自我毁灭而付钱
for your own destruction.

149
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:17,954
我来处理
I'll see to it.

150
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:20,643
快离开这个糟糕的地方
Just get out of this dreadful place.

151
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:30,599
放手!
Let go!

152
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:31,891
把你的手拿开!
Get your hands off!

153
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:35,582
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

154
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:40,271
你跑到这种鬼地方来干什么!
What on earth are you doing in this den?

155
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:42,023
我在处理自己的事情
I'm going about my business.

156
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:43,566
你的马车在外面?
You have a cab outside?

157
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,493
是的
Yes.

158
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,463
快把他送回家吧
I pray send him home.

159
00:11:46,464 --> 00:11:49,288
他已经受不了任何折腾了
He looks too limp to get into any kind of mischief.

160
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,913
五分钟后见      好
I'll see you in five minutes.      All right.

161
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,975
把这个给房子里的女士
Give this to the lady of the house.

162
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:32,643
福尔摩斯!
Holmes!

163
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:43,088
是我 先生
I sir.

164
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,621
在那里见到你让我非常吃惊
I was certainly surprised to see you in that place.

165
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:47,789
你认为除了那些小毛病外
I suppose you think I've added opium to smoking

166
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,457
我又开始吸鸦片了?
to all of my other little weaknesses?

167
00:12:49,582 --> 00:12:50,831
我仅仅是说
I merely said

168
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,240
在那里见到你让我很吃惊
I was surprised to see you there.

169
00:12:52,282 --> 00:12:53,479
见到你我也很吃惊
As indeed I was to see you.

170
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,189
我在找一位朋友
I was searching for a friend.

171
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,451
我在找一位敌人
And I for an enemy.

172
00:12:56,452 --> 00:12:57,316
敌人?
An enemy?

173
00:12:57,317 --> 00:12:58,681
倘若在那里有人把我认出来了
Had I been recognized in that place

174
00:12:58,683 --> 00:13:01,925
我的性命顷刻就会断送
my life would not of been worth an hours purchase.

175
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:03,363
马车!
Cab!

176
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,365
我身处在一个最不可思议的调查中
I'm in the midst of the most remarkable inquiry.

177
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:09,373
我希望你没有吸那烟管里的东西 福尔摩斯
I hope your not smoking the substance in that pipe Holmes.

178
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,532
只为了融入环境稍吸了一点
Only to the extent necessary to merge with the surroundings.

179
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,954
我要去肯特郡的李镇
I'm off to Lee in Kent.

180
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:17,956
你来吗?
Are you coming?

181
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,437
当然
Of course.

182
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,773
现在应该安全了 华生
I think we shall be safe now Watson.

183
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:41,879
拿一下缰绳好吗?
Would you take the reins?

184
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:46,425
我们到底去哪?
Where exactly are we going?

185
00:13:46,488 --> 00:13:48,030
松园
The Cedars,

186
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,572
一栋漂亮的别墅
a lovely villa

187
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:51,907
在肯特郡靠近李镇的地方
near Lee in Kent.

188
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:55,712
能否问一下 我为什么要在三月的星期五
May I ask why I'm going to Lee in Kent

189
00:13:56,005 --> 00:13:58,819
半夜三更的 跑到肯特郡的李镇?
in the middle of the night? On a Friday in March?

190
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:01,624
因为你是我值得信赖的伙伴以及忠诚的朋友
Because you are my trusty comrade and my loyal friend,

191
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:02,591
我可能两样都需要
I may need both.

192
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,021
这是我掌握的一些情况
Here are the facts, as I understand them.

193
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:07,780
几年前 有位叫内维尔・圣克莱尔的
Several years ago there came to Lee in Kent,

194
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,004
绅士来到肯特郡的李镇

195
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,583
他购置了一栋大别墅 叫松园

196
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,216
大约一年后
and about a year later

197
00:14:16,217 --> 00:14:18,260
娶了当地一家酿酒商的女儿为妻

198
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:20,709
现在有两个小孩
They have two small children.

199
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:24,075
他在几家公司里都有股份
He has interests in several companies

200
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,130
每天早上进城
and travels to the city every morning,

201
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,787
每天晚上在坎农街
returning by the 5:14 train

202
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:30,561
乘五点十四分的火车回家
from Cannon Street every night.

203
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,416
他没有不良爱好
He is a man of temperate habits,

204
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,969
是一位好丈夫
a good husband,

205
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,470
慈爱的父亲
an affectionate father

206
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:39,004
在朋友间很受欢迎
and is popular with all who know him.

207
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:41,839
他的负债
His debts,

208
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,943
迄今为止我们所能查明是
as far as we can ascertain,

209
00:14:43,945 --> 00:14:46,351
八十八磅十先令
amount to eighty-eight pounds and ten shillings

210
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:47,998
而其在首都郡县银行的
while he has two hundred and twenty pounds

211
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,103
账户上
to his credit

212
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,677
有两百二十磅存款
in the Capital and Counties Bank.

213
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:51,910
因此 没有理由认为
Therefore, there is no reason to think

214
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:54,024
他存在财务上的困扰
that money troubles have been weighing down.

215
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,432
蹩脚的模仿
Manageable parody.

216
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,434
华生
Watson,

217
00:14:57,538 --> 00:15:00,247
你的话中有一丝怀疑的语气
there's a hint of skepticism in your voice,

218
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,552
这可对你没什么好处
which does you no credit.

219
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:05,000
我想圣克莱尔太太告诉你
I expect Mrs. St.Clair came to you

220
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,449
她的丈夫失踪了?
saying that her husband has disappeared?

221
00:15:06,451 --> 00:15:07,721
没错
Exactly!

222
00:15:07,723 --> 00:15:09,556
看来这成为生活中
Well seems to be a continuous thread

223
00:15:09,557 --> 00:15:11,046
不可或缺的部分了
in life's fabric.

224
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,132
华生 怎么回事?
Watson, what is this?

225
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:15,789
我将忽略你对社会缺陷的
I shall ignore your air of resignation

226
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,676
听之任之的态度 继续介绍案情
to the world's frailties and continue.

227
00:15:17,678 --> 00:15:18,970
请继续
Oh please do.

228
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,157
星期一
On Monday,

229
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,909
圣克莱尔如平常一样进城
St. Clair left for the city as usual.

230
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,588
他临走前答应
Before he left he promised that he would

231
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,454
给孩子们带一盒积木
bring home a box of building bricks for his children.

232
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,236
积木?
Building bricks?

233
00:15:29,238 --> 00:15:30,374
好好记下来 华生
Mark that well Watson.

234
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,773
他走后不久 圣克莱尔太太
Soon after he left, Mrs. St. Clair

235
00:15:35,795 --> 00:15:37,243
收到一封电报

236
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:40,077
说在亚伯丁运输公司的办事处
to say that a parcel of considerable value

237
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,766
有一件寄给她的
had arrived for her at the offices

238
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,446
相当昂贵的包裹
of the Aberdeen Shipping Company.

239
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,834
她决定进城

240
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,386
收取包裹

241

吃午饭并进行购物

242
00:15:57,237 --> 00:15:58,717
她意外地发现
It was by chance

243
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:01,625
自己走到了上天鹅闸巷
that she found herself in Upper Swandam Lane,

244
00:16:01,824 --> 00:16:04,074
那条我们今晚
that same vile alley

245
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:06,024
都拜访过的肮脏的小巷 华生
that we both visited this evening, Watson.

246
00:16:06,077 --> 00:16:07,932
而正在此时
And it was at this point

247
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:11,163
一件非常奇怪的事情发生了
that something quite singular took place.

248
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,007
(穷困的人)

249
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:59,406
请施舍点钱吧
Money please.

250
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:14,510
快走开!
Get out of here!

251
00:17:20,432 --> 00:17:22,047
内维尔!
Neville!

252
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:33,743
内维尔!
Neville!

253
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:40,717
你想上哪去?
Where are you going?

254
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,583
我要上楼
I'm going upstairs.

255
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:43,782
楼上没有人
There's nobody upstairs.

256
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,575
我见到我的丈夫在楼上招手
I saw my husband waving from an upstairs window.

257
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,003
楼上没人
There is nobody upstairs.

258
00:17:49,004 --> 00:17:50,003
我见到他了
I saw him.

259
00:17:50,005 --> 00:17:51,005
我认得自己的丈夫
I know my own husband.

260
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:52,880
他来这里干什么?
What's he doing here?

261
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:54,945
楼上没有人
There is nobody upstairs.

262
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:00,836
内维尔!
Neville!

263
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:02,419
出去
Go on.

264
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,920
他们把她赶出去了?
And they threw her out?

265
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:05,140
没错
They did.

266
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:07,840
那个马来人和印度人
The malay and the lascar,

267
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,122
是那栋房子的主人
who owns the establishment.

268
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:11,489
一个劣迹昭彰的人
A man of the vilest antecedents

269
00:18:11,562 --> 00:18:13,260
把一个杀人凶手放进了酒馆
sent a murderer into the bar.

270
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,390
杀人凶手?却没有受到制裁
A murderer?Yet he goes free.

271
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:17,116
房子的后屋向着河
And the rear of a building backs onto the river.

272
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:18,732
那甚至还有一扇活板门
There's even a convenient trap door

273
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:19,973
作抛弃尸体之用
for the disposal of bodies.

274
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,619
为什么警方不逮捕这两名杀人凶手呢?
Why don't the police arrest these two murderers?

275
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,604
华生 警方逮捕了一个瘸子
Watson, the police have arrested a cripple.

276
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:26,582
还有很长的案情没给你介绍完
There's so much more yet to tell you

277
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,282
但我们已经到达松园了

278
00:18:29,387 --> 00:18:30,606
谢谢
Thank you.

279
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:44,616
福尔摩斯先生?
Mr. Holmes?

280
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:47,263
有进展吗?
Any news?

281
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,327
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair

282
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,412
我以为你已经入睡了
I thought you'd be asleep.

283
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,214
在这种时候
Sleep does not come easily

284
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,350
想安然入睡并不容易
at a time like this.

285
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:54,196
这位是我的朋友兼同事华生医生
This is my friend and colleague Doctor Watson

286
00:18:54,197 --> 00:18:55,436
慷慨地答应
who has kindly agreed

287
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:56,667
协助我进行调查
to help me in my investigation.

288
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,366
福尔摩斯先生提起过你
Mr. Holmes has spoken of you.

289
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,774
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair.

290
00:19:01,004 --> 00:19:02,472
我擅作主张请医生
I have taken the liberty of asking the doctor

291
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,504
在此处过夜
to stay overnight.

292
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:05,620
而我擅作主张
And I took the liberty

293
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,706
准备了一顿冷晚餐
of preparing a little cold supper.

294
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:14,013
华生医生你坐我的位置吧
Oh Doctor Watson you take my place.

295
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:14,897
万万不可
Oh no really.

296
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:18,483
华生 圣克莱尔太太是位非常执着的女性
Watson, Mrs. St. Clair is a very strong willed woman,

297
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:20,120
最好不要冒险拒绝她
you refuse her at your peril.

298
00:19:20,121 --> 00:19:21,132
谢谢
Thank you.

299
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:25,363
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生
Now Mr. Sherlock Holmes

300
00:19:25,365 --> 00:19:26,490
在用餐前
before we eat

301
00:19:27,408 --> 00:19:29,461
我想问你几个直截了当的问题
I should like to ask one or two plain questions

302
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,628
希望能得到坦率的回答
to which I should like plain answers.

303
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,171
当然 夫人
Certainly Madame.

304
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,505
你打心底里认为
Do you in your heart of hearts

305
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,018
内维尔还活着吗?
think that Neville is still alive?

306
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,041
请坦白回答
Frankly now

307
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:42,126
我既不会歇斯底里
I'm not hysterical

308
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:43,336
也不会晕厥
nor am I given to fainting.

309
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,131
那坦白地说
Frankly then,

310
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,768
我不认为
I do not.

311
00:19:52,342 --> 00:19:53,643
你认为他已经死了?
You think he is dead?

312
00:19:53,645 --> 00:19:54,499
是的
I do.

313
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,928
谋杀?
Murdered?

314
00:19:56,126 --> 00:19:57,460
我没这么说
I didn't say that.

315
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:00,056
或许
Perhaps.

316
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:03,287
那他是什么时候死的呢?
And on what day did he meet his death?

317
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:04,518
星期一
On Monday.

318
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:05,924
那怎么解释我在今天
So then how do you explain

319
00:20:05,925 --> 00:20:10,957
星期五 收到他的来信呢?
that I received a letter from him today,being Friday?

320
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:35,768
现在 圣克莱尔太太
Now Mrs. St. Clair

321
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,187
你能否帮我个忙?
I wonder if you would do me a favor?

322
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,001
竭尽所能
By all means.

323
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,605
我已经将你被驱逐出那栋房子
I have told Doctor Watson what happened

324
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,832
之前的案情向华生医生介绍过了
up to the moment when you were ejected from that building.

325
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,467
你能告诉我们随后发生的事情吗?
Would you tell us what happened subsequently please?

326
00:20:47,934 --> 00:20:49,653
告诉华生医生吗?
For Doctor Watson's benefit?

327
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:51,499
也告诉我
And for mine.

328
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,124
我得将所掌握的他们的信息
I too have to reexamine the facts,

329
00:20:54,126 --> 00:20:55,491
重新梳理一遍
as we know them.

330
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,910
如果你还不是太疲倦的话
Now if you're not too tired.

331
00:20:58,754 --> 00:20:59,952
没问题
Of course.

332
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,205
你可以想象得到
As you may imagine

333
00:21:03,445 --> 00:21:04,507
我对被强行赶出
I do not take kindly

334
00:21:04,508 --> 00:21:06,092
这件事是绝对无法容忍的
to being forcibly removed from a building.

335
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:08,824
我便寻求警察的帮助
I sought and found police help.

336
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:11,241
几名巡佐和巡官?
Two constables and Inspector?

337
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:12,429
布莱斯特里特
Bradstreet.

338
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,462
布莱斯特里特
Bradstreet.

339
00:21:13,546 --> 00:21:14,764
然后你们返回那栋房子?
And then you returned to the building?

340
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:15,598
是的
Yes.

341
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,155
两次拜访间隔了多久?
The period of time between these two visits was?

342
00:21:18,192 --> 00:21:20,047
大概二十分钟
About twenty minutes.

343
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,835
我们回去的时候
By the time we returned

344
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:26,023
门没有上锁
the door was unbolted.

345
00:21:26,472 --> 00:21:28,232
我肯定是那个印度人
Though I'm sure the lascar

346
00:21:28,234 --> 00:21:29,943
在我离开以后把锁打开的
had bolted it when I left earlier.

347
00:21:34,342 --> 00:21:36,426
我要检查你楼上的房间
I want to look at your upstairs rooms.

348
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:38,094
楼上没人
There's nobody there.

349
00:21:38,095 --> 00:21:39,795
如果楼上没有人 你就没理由拒绝我检查
If there's nobody there you can't object that I look.

350
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:41,264
你们俩留在这里
You men stay here.

351
00:21:48,582 --> 00:21:50,364
他就在这间房里!
He was in this room!

352
00:21:56,994 --> 00:21:58,557
我说过好多回了
Time and again I tell you,

353
00:21:58,724 --> 00:21:59,954
这里没人
there's nobody here.

354
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,809
能检查一下那间房吗?
May we look in that room?

355
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:16,950
你不必担心这位男子 圣克莱尔太太
You mustn't be worried by this gentleman,Mrs. St. Clair.

356
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:19,103
他是警察局的老朋友了
He's an old friend of the constabulary.

357
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,656
你知道 警官
You know, Inspector,

358
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,262
根据W・S・吉尔伯特所说
according to W. S. Gilbert,

359
00:22:23,398 --> 00:22:26,566
警察的生活不是愉快的生活
a policeman's life isn't a happy one.

360
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,685
布恩先生是位职业乞丐
Mr. Boone is a professional beggar.

361
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:33,551
不是乞丐
No, not a beggar

362
00:22:33,588 --> 00:22:36,772
是位诚实的商人
an honest trader.

363
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:40,898
他住在这里吗?
Does this man lodge here?

364
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,951
是的
Yes.

365
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,568
你说没有人住在这里
You told me nobody lived here.

366
00:22:43,673 --> 00:22:46,591
夫人 这个乞丐算不上是人
Madame, the beggar is nobody.

367
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:49,593
你们要是用刀剑刺我们 我们不是也会出血的吗?
If you prick us do we not bleed?

368
00:22:49,604 --> 00:22:50,624
莎士比亚 布恩先生
Shakespeare, Mr. Boone,

369
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:52,824
我知道这句话 你以前跟我说过
I know that one you've told it to me before.

370
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:58,308
巡官?
Inspector?

371
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,874
这是泰晤士河 圣克莱尔太太
That would be the Thames Mrs. St Clair?

372
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,293
这是扇大窗户
And the large window.

373
00:23:08,816 --> 00:23:09,733
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair

374
00:23:11,964 --> 00:23:13,590
窗户与河十分接近
a window and a river in close proximity

375
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,310
并不必然与暴力致死划等号
does not automatically mean violent death.

376
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:25,161
过去一个小时你一直在这里?
You been here in the past hour?

377
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:26,151
是的
Yes.

378
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:27,610
还有人来过这里吗?
Anyone else been here?

379
00:23:27,788 --> 00:23:30,487
唉 没有 我如一朵流云独自在此
Alas, no, I've been as lonely as a cloud.

华兹华斯(英国浪漫主义诗人) 巡官
Wordsworth, Inspector.

382
00:23:58,508 --> 00:23:59,842
他就站在这里
He was standing here.

383
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:01,676
我见到他
I saw him.

384
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,657
圣克莱尔太太 没有证据表明
Mrs. St. Clair there is no evidence

385
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:07,036
他曾经来过这里
to suggest that he was ever here.

386
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:18,626
积木 巡官
Building bricks, Inspector.

387
00:24:20,117 --> 00:24:21,315
的确
So I see.

388
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:24,296
我丈夫今早进城前
My husband left for the city this morning

389
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:25,964
跟我说的最后一句话
and the last thing he said to me

390
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:28,341
就是要给女儿买盒积木
was that he had to buy some building bricks

391
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,789
做生日礼物
for our little girl's birthday.

392
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,582
我明白了
I see.

393
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,960
你们哪位买过积木?
Either of you gentlemen buy building bricks?

394
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,212
肯定是有人落在这的
Somebody must have left them.

395
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,984
这些是我丈夫的衣服!
And these are my husband's clothes!

396
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:56,757
你确定?
Are you sure?

397
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:59,019
在你检查的时候需要我
Shall I describe them to you in detail

398
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,603
细细形容吗?
as you examine them?

399
00:25:01,594 --> 00:25:03,438
我丈夫的裁缝名叫斯马德
My husband's tailor's name is Smud

400
00:25:03,439 --> 00:25:05,596
如果你检查一下标签就会发现
if you care to examine the label.

401
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:13,049
从那时起 布莱斯特里特巡官
At that moment Inspector Bradstreet

402
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,874
开始相信我的话
began to believe my story.

403
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:15,843
他和他的手下
He and his men

404
00:25:15,844 --> 00:25:17,615
对那栋楼进行了地毯式搜索
made an extensive search of the building

405
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:21,096
在窗台上发现了血迹
they found a bloodstain upon the windowsill.

406
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:25,173
他们搜查了那个马来人 印度人和布恩
They searched the malay, the lascar and Boone

407
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,320
但什么也没找到
but found nothing.

408
00:25:28,092 --> 00:25:30,239
他们无法找到我丈夫的大衣
They failed to find my husband's overcoat.

409
00:25:31,095 --> 00:25:32,240
什么
Well.

410
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,512
大衣?
Overcoat?

411
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:35,930
唯一一件无法
The one item of clothing

412
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,265
找到的衣物
that was not accounted for.

413
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,987
直到退潮
Until low tide.

414
00:26:00,334 --> 00:26:02,033
很重 长官
It's heavy sir.

415
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,182
被什么东西坠得很沉
Weighted down with something.

416
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:19,917
总共有四百二十一便士
There were four hundred and twenty-one pennies,

417
00:26:19,999 --> 00:26:21,858
两百七十半便士

418
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,747
塞满大衣的每个口袋
stuffed into every pocket of the overcoat.

419
00:26:26,415 --> 00:26:28,239
你的结论 华生
Your conclusion Watson.

420
00:26:32,336 --> 00:26:33,565
你尽管说 华生医生
Speak freely Doctor Watson.

421
00:26:33,566 --> 00:26:34,847
过去的一个星期里
I've lived with every possibility

422
00:26:34,848 --> 00:26:36,786
无论多可怕的可能性我都想过了
this past week however hideous.

423
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:41,372
凶手一定是
The murderer must have been

424
00:26:41,374 --> 00:26:42,457
乞丐布恩
Boone the beggar.

425
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,451
还有什么人会有
Who else could have access to

426
00:26:43,557 --> 00:26:46,636
如此大量的便士和半便士?
such a vast number of pennies and halfpennies?

427
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,607
警方也是如此认为
That is the conclusion reached by the police.

428
00:26:49,473 --> 00:26:50,472
他们逮捕了布恩
They've arrested Boone

429
00:26:50,474 --> 00:26:53,191
他现在在船首街的警察局里
and he is presently in Bow Street Police Station.

430
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,478
尽管我的丈夫仍然活着
Even though my husband is still alive.

431
00:27:02,858 --> 00:27:06,057
圣克莱尔太太
Now Mrs. St. Clair

432
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,088
让我们来重新考究
let us reexamine

433
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,360
这封信的重要性
the significance of this letter.

434
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:10,289
我能给华生医生读一下吗?
May I read it to Doctor Watson?

435
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,561
当然可以
By all means.

436
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:15,158
谢谢
Thank you.

437
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,096
亲爱的 不要害怕
Dearest, Do not be frightened,

438
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:18,951
出了一个极大的错误
there is a huge error,

439
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:22,495
可能需要一点时间纠正
which it may take some little time to rectify.

440
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,290
耐心等待 内维尔
Wait in patience. Neville.

441
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,508
用铅笔
Written in pencil

442
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,728
写于书的空白页
on the flyleaf of a book,

443
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,908
八开的书 没有水印
octavo size, no watermark.

444
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,681
由一名拇指肮脏的男子于格雷夫森德寄出
Posted in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb.

445
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:36,079
这不是你丈夫的笔迹?
This is not your husband's writing?

446
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:36,870
不是
No.

447
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:38,227
但这封短信是?
But the note is?

448
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,539
毫无疑问
Without question.

449
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,906
这是他匆忙时常用的笔迹
It's the hand he always used when he was in hurry.

450
00:27:42,073 --> 00:27:45,564
给信封封口的人
Whoever gummed down the envelope

451
00:27:45,565 --> 00:27:47,785
没有正确地处理信封
handled this very much in error.

452
00:27:49,871 --> 00:27:51,017
有嚼烟叶的习惯
Been chewing tobacco.

453
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:53,852
这是个微不足道的细节 华生
This is a trifle, of course, Watson

454
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:58,126
但微不足道的细节最重要
but there is nothing so important as trifles.

455
00:28:03,328 --> 00:28:04,631
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair

456
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,862
信里还有个附件?
there was an enclosure?

457
00:28:15,305 --> 00:28:16,482
他的图章戒指
His signet ring.

458
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:24,623
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair

459
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:25,843
你丈夫是否提起过
has your husband ever spoken of

460
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:29,638
上天鹅闸巷的黄金酒馆?      从未提起过
the Bar of Gold in Upper Swandam Lane?        Never.

461
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,763
华生医生可能
I suspect that Doctor Watson

462
00:28:30,764 --> 00:28:32,682
想问你一个问题
has a question to put to you.

463
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,311
这个问题不好开口
This is a difficult question to ask

464
00:28:39,312 --> 00:28:40,312
圣克莱尔太太
Mrs. St. Clair

465
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:43,282
你的丈夫有没有任何
but has your husband ever shown

466
00:28:43,284 --> 00:28:45,264
吸食鸦片的迹象?
any signs of taking opium?

467
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,489
他举止总是非常正常
He always appeared perfectly normal

468
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:56,072
但我得坦白
though I confess

469
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:57,627
我不懂辨认迹象
I would not recognize the signs.

470
00:28:57,846 --> 00:28:59,347
有什么迹象?
What are they?

471
00:28:59,608 --> 00:29:01,347
无精打采
Well a listlessness,

472
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:03,350
缺乏活力
a lack of energy,

473
00:29:03,392 --> 00:29:04,964
无法集中精神
an inability to concentrate,

474
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:06,882
对一切都缺乏兴趣
a general air of apathy.

475
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:08,686
华生医生对
Doctor Watson is a specialist

476
00:29:08,687 --> 00:29:10,313
无法控制的瘾疾很在行
at uncontrolled addiction.

477
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,868
我丈夫没有沉迷于鸦片
My husband was not an opium addict,

478
00:29:15,192 --> 00:29:18,475
换言之他不吸食鸦片
that's to say is not an opium addict.

479
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:24,646
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

480
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,815
我知道你认为我丈夫已经身亡了
I know you think my husband is dead.

481
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:30,013
我完全意识到
I fully realize

482
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:31,504
那封信可能写于星期一
that letter could have been written on Monday

483
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:32,829
只是在今天才寄出
and only posted today.

484
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:35,392
我知道他们
I know the circumstances

485
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:36,727
所列举的种种情形
as they have been described

486
00:29:36,728 --> 00:29:38,957
都不可避免地得出
lead to the inescapable conclusion

487
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,077
他已被谋杀这一结论
that he has been murdered

488
00:29:40,283 --> 00:29:42,366
但同样我也知道
but equally I know

489
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:43,598
他还活着
that he is alive.

490
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,767
我们之间有着紧密的联系
There's such a keen bond of sympathy between us.

491
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:51,655
如果他遭遇不幸我会感应到的
I should know if evil came upon him.

492
00:29:57,211 --> 00:29:59,420
请帮我找到他
Please help me to find him.

493
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:41,648
华生 如果内维尔・圣克莱尔
Watson if Neville St. Clair

494
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:42,950
还活着并且毫发无损
is alive and well

495
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:45,425
为什么不回家来证明这一点呢?
why doesn't he come home and demonstrate the fact?

496
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:47,725
因为他可能已经不在人世了
Well presumably because he's not alive and well.

497
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:48,653
是 但这封信呢?
Yes but this letter?

498
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:49,893
可能写于任何时候
Could have been written at any time.

499
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:51,864
可能写于极度痛苦之时
Perhaps under distress.

500
00:30:51,865 --> 00:30:53,345
也可能是精心伪造的
It could even be a skillful forgery.

501
00:30:53,908 --> 00:30:55,711
那这枚图章戒指呢?
And this signet ring?

502
00:30:55,816 --> 00:30:56,962
很容易取下来
Easily removed,

503
00:30:57,046 --> 00:30:59,162
特别是从一具尸体上取下来
especially if the victim is dead.

504
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:02,987
的确
Indeed.

505
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:06,467
回到内维尔・圣克莱尔
Preceding on the hypothesis

506
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,553
已经死了这一假设
that Neville St.Clair is dead,

507
00:31:09,211 --> 00:31:11,056
他是怎么死的呢?
how did he meet his death?

508
00:31:11,212 --> 00:31:12,838
很明显是被谋杀的
Well clearly he was murdered.

509
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:13,994
被谁谋杀的?
By whom?

510
00:31:13,995 --> 00:31:16,005
警方认为是那个叫布恩的家伙
Well the police think it was this chap, Boone.

511
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,414
我十分赞同警方的看法
I see no reason to disagree with the police.

512
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:20,896
除了...
Except...

513
00:31:21,303 --> 00:31:22,950
除了什么?
Except what?

514
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:24,565
你说他是个瘸子?
You say he's a cripple?

515
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:25,722
是的
Yes.

516
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,067
他的残疾有多严重?
How severe is his disability?

517
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:30,038
只是有一点跛
Has only a slight limp.

518
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:31,778
我的行医经验告诉我
Well my medical experience tells me

519
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:33,424
通常当一条腿有缺陷时
when there is a weakness in one limb

520
00:31:33,426 --> 00:31:34,957
作为补偿
it's very often compensated for

521
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:36,761
另一条腿会变得非常健壮
by exceptional strength in the others.

522
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,556
无法说服你?
You're not convinced?

523
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:46,038
这名男子是个职业乞丐
This man is a professional beggar.

524
00:31:46,227 --> 00:31:48,363
在城里很出名
He's well known in the city.

525
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,376
也很受欢迎
He's well liked in the city.

526
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:52,544
我见过他许多次了
I've seen him many times.

527
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,867
他巧舌如簧
He has a remarkable faculty for repartee

528
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:57,870
极能取悦施舍他的人
with which he delights his many clients.

529
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:00,048
听起来没什么危害性
Well he sounds harmless.

530
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:02,362
既然如此 警方为什么要逮捕他
Why, therefore, did the police arrest him

531
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,499
而不是那个印度人呢?
rather than the lascar?

532
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,728
这正是我向巡官
That is the very question

533
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,637
布莱斯特里特提出的问题
that I put to Inspector Bradstreet.

534
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:15,413
用排除法可以肯定
The murder has obviously been committed

535
00:32:15,414 --> 00:32:17,101
凶案肯定发生了
by process of elimination.

536
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,406
布恩一定是凶手
Boone must be the murderer.

537
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,062
这些是内维尔・圣克莱尔的衣服?
Are these Neville St. Clair's clothes?

538
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:29,518
为什么排除了那名印度人的嫌疑?
Why did you eliminate the lascar as a suspect?

539
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,602
因为圣克莱尔太太
Because Mrs. St. Clair

540
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:33,165
见到她丈夫在楼上的一扇窗户旁
saw her husband in an upstairs window

541
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,436
正在与人搏斗
apparently in the middle of a struggle.

542
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:35,833
她从楼下的门进去
She went to a downstairs door

543
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:38,003
被印度人拦住了
and was confronted by the lascar.

544
00:32:39,786 --> 00:32:41,421
当她在跟我们讲述时
While we were conversing

545
00:32:41,422 --> 00:32:42,536
更确切的说
or to be more precise

546
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:44,497
当那个印度人和他的助手
while the lascar and his assistant

547
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,247
将圣克莱尔太太赶出门时
were ejecting Mrs. St. Clair from the building

548
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:48,781
楼上的搏斗仍未停止
the fight was proceeding upstairs,

549
00:32:48,782 --> 00:32:49,792
并且导致
leading as we now know

550
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:51,909
内维尔・圣克莱尔的死亡
to the death of Neville St. Clair.

551
00:32:52,951 --> 00:32:54,471
二十一岁的生日礼物
A twenty first birthday present.

552
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,370
极其注意细节的人
A man of meticulous habits.

553
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,454
没有划痕
No scratches.

554
00:32:58,174 --> 00:33:00,477
谋杀圣克莱尔的动机是什么?
What was the motive in killing St. Clair?

555
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:02,177
还有待调查
That remains to be established.

556
00:33:07,576 --> 00:33:08,816
没有鸦片的气味
Not a trace of opium

557
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:11,610
有可能是抢劫吗?
Could it have been robbery.

558
00:33:11,684 --> 00:33:12,860
不 不
No. No.

559
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:14,779
圣克莱尔的钱包还在口袋里
St. Clair's wallet was in his pocket,

560
00:33:14,821 --> 00:33:16,186
分文未少
the money untouched.

561
00:33:20,044 --> 00:33:23,348
怎么解释大衣里的硬币?
How do you explain the coins in the overcoat?

562
00:33:25,902 --> 00:33:28,965
我无法回答 福尔摩斯先生
I cannot truly answer that Mr. Holmes.

563
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,500
我来试试
Let me try.

564
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:35,105
布恩将圣克莱尔杀死后
Boone killed St. Clair.

565
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:37,253
脱去其外衣
He removes the outer garments

566
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:41,271
企图将衣服及衣服内的物品换成现金
hoping to capitalize on them and their contents.

567
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,549
他抬起尸体
He lifts the body,

568
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,740
穿过房间
carries it across the room,

569
00:33:48,418 --> 00:33:50,295
将尸体推出窗口
forces it through the open window,

570
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,509
由此导致皮肤擦伤
hence the abrasion,

571
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,195
血滴落在窗台上
blood upon the windowsill,

572
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,225
他将尸体放入河中
he releases it into the river...

573
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,778
潮水将尸体卷走
Where it's sucked away by the tide.

574
00:33:59,343 --> 00:34:00,582
在这一系列行为期间
In the midst of this activity

575
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:02,062
他听见圣克莱尔太太想
he hears the scuffle downstairs

576
00:34:02,063 --> 00:34:04,564
强行闯入所发出的吵杂声
as Mrs. St. Clair tries to force her way in.

577
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:05,887
时间宝贵
There's not a moment to be lost.

578
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:07,692
必须将衣物处理掉
Must dispose the clothing.

579
00:34:13,029 --> 00:34:15,025
他从大衣着手
He starts with the overcoat.

580
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,218
并马上意识到
He realizes, at once,

581
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:18,240
大衣不会沉入水中
it will float and not sink

582
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:19,978
他是怎么做的?
so what does he do?

583
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:24,277
他迅速穿过房间来到
He rushes across the room

584
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:25,683
某个秘密藏宝地
to some secret hall

585
00:34:25,684 --> 00:34:27,971
里面均为其乞讨所得
where he's accumulated the fruits of his beggary,

586
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:31,614
将所有能拿到的硬币
stuffs all the coins that he can lay his hands on

587
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:33,011
放进大衣的口袋里
into the pockets of the overcoat...

588
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:36,206
然后将其扔进河中
And drops it into the water.

589
00:34:36,661 --> 00:34:38,505
如果你和你的手下没有赶到
And would presumably have done the same

590
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:39,495
其他的衣物
with the other garments

591
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:40,746
也会落得同样的下场
if you and your men had not arrived.

592
00:34:43,353 --> 00:34:45,096
他将这些衣物藏到帘子后面
Conceals the other garments behind the curtain

593
00:34:45,115 --> 00:34:46,521
希望不会被发现
and hopes they'll not be noticed

594
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:48,122
如果不是圣克莱尔太太如此坚持
and they would not have been noticed

595
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:50,971
则会正中其下怀
had Mrs. St. Clair not been so persistent.

596
00:34:50,973 --> 00:34:55,641
巡官 无论那个毒窝
Inspector, whatever plot has been hatched

597
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:56,892
在酝酿何种阴谋
in that opium den

598
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,227
我认为那个印度人
I cannot but imagine

599
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,521
都脱不了干系
that the lascar is not somehow involved.

600
00:35:02,857 --> 00:35:04,863
我当天极想逮捕他
I was sorely tempted to arrest him on the day.

601
00:35:07,203 --> 00:35:08,672
我现在就派几个人过去
I'll send a couple of men up there now.

602
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,038
不
No.

603
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,071
巡管
Inspector,

604
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,605
如果你允许
with your permission,

605
00:35:15,887 --> 00:35:18,560
我可以提出另外一个策略吗?
may I suggest an alternative strategy?

606
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:21,807
当然可以
By all means.

607
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,539
让我来拜访这个毒窝
Let me visit the opium den

608
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,706
谨慎低调
discreetly,

609
00:35:26,926 --> 00:35:27,926
乔装打扮
incognito.

610
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,115
就能得知我们想要知道的
We shall learn what we may.

611
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,347
那你有什么收获?
But what did you learn?

612
00:35:35,307 --> 00:35:36,182
一无所获
Nothing.

613
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,383
一无所获
Nothing.

614
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:54,341
据我调查所知...每一个人
Everybody... as far as I can ascertain,

615
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:55,758
都在说真话
appears to be telling the truth.

616
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:06,297
我无法弄清总体情形
I cannot see an over all pattern.

617
00:36:08,507 --> 00:36:10,071
你呢 华生?
Can you see a pattern Watson?

618
00:36:10,353 --> 00:36:12,385
我无法弄清
I see no pattern

619
00:36:13,417 --> 00:36:15,022
我只见到一位女士
but I do see a woman

620
00:36:16,503 --> 00:36:18,619
不顾所有的客观情形
who despite all objective circumstances

621
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,359
仍然坚信她的丈夫仍然在世
still believes that her husband is alive.

622
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:22,078
而你多次说过
And you said on many occasions

623
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,632
一位女士的感觉
that the impression of a woman

624
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,560
可能远比分析推理
may be more valuable than the

625
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:27,197
所得的结论来得有价值
conclusion of an analytical reason.

626
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:30,033
是啊
Yeah.

627
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:36,319
但如果他还活着
But if he is still alive.

628
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:40,738
他在哪里?
Where is he?

629
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:42,542
我不知道
I have no idea

630
00:36:44,106 --> 00:36:46,183
但我却有个急迫的请求
but I do have an urgent request.

631
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,630
现在已经是凌晨四点多了
It's now well past four in the morning,

632
00:36:49,662 --> 00:36:50,766
我可以睡了吗?
may I go to sleep?

633
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:52,070
当然
Certainly.

634
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:54,405
谢谢
Thank you.

635
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:54,313
华生
Watson.

636
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:58,212
华生
Watson.

637
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,728
几点了?
What time is it?

638
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:07,927
拂晓
Dawn.

639
00:39:10,554 --> 00:39:11,939
我才睡了两个小时
I've only had two hours sleep.

640
00:39:11,941 --> 00:39:13,086
你能不能
I wonder if you'd do me

641
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,274
好心帮个忙
the very great kindness

642
00:39:14,276 --> 00:39:16,277
考虑一下起个床呢?
of considering the possibility of waking up?

643
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:18,610
我想你有个起床的好理由
I assume you have a good reason.

644
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:19,861
你想一起跑一趟吗?
Are you game for a drive?

645
00:39:19,863 --> 00:39:20,811
当然
Certainly.

646
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:22,717
但非得这么早吗?
Does it have to be this early?

647
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:24,428
我想验证我的一个小设想
I have a little theory I wish to test.

648
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:26,543
有人命悬一线吗?
Is anyone's life at stake?

649
00:39:26,545 --> 00:39:27,535
当然没有
Certainly not.

650
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,036
可以在早上的晚些时候
Would it be possible to test your theory

651
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,371
再验证你的设想吗?
a little later this morning?

652
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,435
五分钟后楼下见
I'll see you downstairs in five minutes.

653
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:36,083
五分钟
Five minutes.

654
00:39:43,077 --> 00:39:44,713
出发 尼尔森
Come on Nelson.

655
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,993
你在保持缄默方面真有天赋 华生
You have the grand gift of silence Watson.

656
00:39:57,223 --> 00:39:59,495
让你成为一位难能可贵的同伴
It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.

657
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:04,112
华生 你正在
Watson you're in the presence

658
00:40:04,113 --> 00:40:06,453
全欧洲最笨的笨蛋面前
of one of the most absolute fools in Europe.

659
00:40:06,624 --> 00:40:08,396
你太夸张了 福尔摩斯      在你起床的时候
You exaggerate Holmes.        I deserve to be kicked

660
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,917
我就该被踢到查林克罗斯去
from here to Charing Cross.

661
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:10,918
你叫醒我的时候
The moment you woke me up

662
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,165
那我该准备好...      我掌握事情关键了 华生
I would have been prepared to...        I've got the key Watson

663
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,954
就在这个袋子里
here in this Gladstone bag.

664
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:25,930
早上好 先生们
Good morning gentlemen.

665
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:27,722
华生 我得承认
Watson I confess

666
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:29,329
我跟鼹鼠一样瞎
I have been as blind as a mole,

667
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:31,497
但现在学聪明
but it's better to learn wisdom later

668
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,134
总比不学好
than to never learn it at all.

669
00:40:33,332 --> 00:40:34,280
布莱斯特里特
Bradstreet.

670
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:40,399
布莱斯特里特
Bradstreet.

671
00:40:41,067 --> 00:40:43,370
我已经就那个乞丐布恩的事来电话了
I've called about that beggar man, Boone.

672
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,787
他在监狱里 福尔摩斯先生
He's in the cells Mr. Holmes.

673
00:40:44,788 --> 00:40:45,756
我能为你效劳吗?
What can I do for you?

674
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:46,997
我很想见见他
I should very much like to see him.

675
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:48,195
他可能还在睡觉呢
He'd probably be asleep.

676
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,145
绝大多数人可能都在睡觉 福尔摩斯
Most of the population is probably asleep Holmes.

677
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,698
好 福尔摩斯 华生医生
Very well Holmes, Doctor Watson

678
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,719
这边走
if you'll come this way.

679
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:55,075
能把你的袋子留在办公室吗 福尔摩斯先生?
You can leave your bag in the office Mr. Holmes?

680
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,139
我要拿着
I'll take it with me.

681
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,755
那里有关键
It contains the key.

682
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:01,393
他是个肮脏的无赖
He's a dirty scoundrel.

683
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,957
很肮脏
Filthy.

684
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:04,572
不肯洗澡
Refuses to wash.

685
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:07,231
说洗澡会削弱人的抵抗力
Says washing weakens a man's resistance.

686
00:41:13,642 --> 00:41:14,861
在睡觉
Asleep.

687
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:19,688
他真是个美人 是吧?
He's a beauty isn't he?

688
00:41:20,991 --> 00:41:22,230
巡官 烦请你尽可能
Inspector would you do me the great goodness

689
00:41:22,231 --> 00:41:24,628
小声地将门打开 好吗?
of opening the door as quietly as possible?

690
00:43:21,848 --> 00:43:24,452
先生们 容我为你们介绍
Gentlemen, let me introduce you

691
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:25,985
来自肯特郡李镇的
to Mr. Neville St. Clair

692
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,227
内维尔・圣克莱尔先生
of Lee in the county of Kent.

693
00:43:29,989 --> 00:43:31,375
天老爷啊
Great heaven.

694
00:43:34,597 --> 00:43:35,607
是的
It is true

695
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:39,383
请问我被控何罪?
and pray what am I being charged with?

696
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:43,675
被控谋杀
Charged with making away

697
00:43:43,676 --> 00:43:45,229
内维尔・圣克莱尔先生
with Mr. Neville St. Clair.

698
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,117
谋杀我自己?
Well making away with myself?

699
00:43:52,391 --> 00:43:54,131
我当了二十七年警察了
I've been on the force for twenty-seven years.

700
00:43:55,455 --> 00:43:56,810
这回真是得奖了
This takes the cake.

701
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,102
但很明显
But since it is obvious

702
00:43:59,104 --> 00:44:00,969
没有任何凶案发生
that no crime has been committed

703
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,128
我是被非法拘留
I am illegally detained.

704
00:44:05,556 --> 00:44:08,412
我一人的力量胜于十人
My strength is the strength of ten

705
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,544
因我心灵纯净
because my heart is pure.

706
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,740
亚弗烈・丁尼生(维多利亚时代最杰出的诗人)
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

707
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:27,082
你向你的妻子撒谎 圣克莱尔先生
You lied to your wife Mr. St. Clair.

708
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,913
这也是纯净吗?
Is that purity?

709
00:45:22,528 --> 00:45:24,007
希望你们理解
Let it be understood

710
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:26,042
我宁愿忍受牢狱之灾
that I would have endured imprisonment,

711
00:45:26,812 --> 00:45:29,510
甚至死刑
even execution,

712
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:31,585
也不愿将我这个可耻的秘密
rather than reveal my miserable secret

713
00:45:31,586 --> 00:45:33,107
透露给我的妻儿
to my wife and children.

714
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:37,914
那就现在透露 圣克莱尔先生
All is now revealed Mr. St. Clair.

715
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,354
好吧
So be it.

716
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,160
我父亲曾是切斯特菲尔德的教师
My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield

717
00:45:47,556 --> 00:45:49,890
我受过良好的教育
I've received an excellent education.

718
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:53,174
酷爱旅行和表演
Traveled, took to the stage

719
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:57,271
最后成为伦敦
and finally became a reporter

720
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:58,699
一家报社的记者
in a London newspaper.

721
00:45:59,888 --> 00:46:01,023
有一天 我的编辑
One day my editor

722
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:02,389
想要一系列关于
wished to have a series of articles

723
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:06,392
首都乞讨状况的报道
upon begging in the metropolis,

724
00:46:06,643 --> 00:46:08,382
而我自动请缨
and I volunteered to supply them.

725
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:10,833
因此你成为一名乞丐?
So you became a beggar?

726
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:12,636
是的
Yes.

727
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:15,252
而你当演员的经历
And your experience as an actor

728
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,098
肯定大派用场
must have proved invaluable.

729
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:19,641
是的
Yes.

730
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,393
的确
Exactly.

731
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:25,718
我给自己化妆
Yes I painted my face

732
00:46:25,719 --> 00:46:28,033
弄得自己一副可怜相
to make myself look as pitiable as possible.

733
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:31,202
还弄了骇人的伤疤
I manufactured frightening scars.

734
00:46:31,754 --> 00:46:33,306
我用肉色熟石膏
I twisted my lip

735
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:35,736
把嘴唇一边向上扭卷起来
for the aid of a piece of flesh colored plaster

736
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:38,363
戴上深色假发
and then with a dark wig

737
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,530
配以合适的服装
and appropriate clothing

738
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:40,895
在首都
took my position

739
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:42,782
最繁华的地方蹲点
in the busiest part of the metropolis,

740
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:48,485
以卖火柴的名义 实际上
ostensibly as a match-seller but, yes,

741
00:46:48,703 --> 00:46:51,497
是一名乞丐
really as a beggar.

742
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:53,049
你收入颇丰?
And you did well?

743
00:46:53,051 --> 00:46:54,635
是的
Yes.

744
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:57,832
一天之内讨到二十六先令和四便士
In one day I took twenty-six shillings and four pence.

745
00:46:59,337 --> 00:47:01,484
我为报社写了文章
I wrote my articles for the newspaper.

746
00:47:01,557 --> 00:47:02,660
我的编辑很高兴
My editor was delighted

747
00:47:02,662 --> 00:47:04,246
我也就再也没想过这件事了
and I thought no more about it

748
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:07,602
直到有一天 我为一位朋友
until one day I backed a bill

749
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:08,925
背书担保了一张票据
for a friend of mine,

750
00:47:08,927 --> 00:47:10,885
后来接到传票
had a writ served on me

751
00:47:10,886 --> 00:47:12,241
让我赔偿二十五镑
for twenty-five pounds.

752
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,513
我头脑一片空白
Well I was at my wits end

753
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:17,779
我该怎么办?
I mean what could I do?

754
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:22,144
突然计上心来
And then suddenly an idea came to me.

755
00:47:23,437 --> 00:47:27,106
我向雇主请了两星期的假
I asked for a fortnight's holiday from my employers

756
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:32,234
在城里四处乞讨
and spent the time in the city begging.

757
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,811
不消十天
In ten days I had the money

758
00:47:36,957 --> 00:47:40,065
我就筹够钱还债
and was able to pay back the debt.

759
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,013
这时我就陷入了泥潭
That was when I fell into the trap.

760
00:47:43,941 --> 00:47:45,097
你当时在报社
How much were you earning

761
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,650
的收入是多少?
from the newspaper at this time?

762
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:47,767
一周两镑
Two pounds a week.

763
00:47:48,257 --> 00:47:49,643
远不及乞讨
Far less than begging.

764
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:50,840
是的
Yes.

765
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:52,456
过去几年我的年平均收入
During the last few years I had earned, on average,

766
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:54,480
最少有七百英镑
at least seven hundred pounds a year.

767
00:47:56,492 --> 00:47:58,378
但这是一名绅士的恶行
But that's a gentlemen's guilt.

768
00:47:58,431 --> 00:47:59,702
冷静点 布莱斯特里特
Calmly Bradstreet.

769
00:48:00,203 --> 00:48:01,327
可以很中肯地说
I think it's pertinent to say

770
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:04,101
圣克莱尔先生不是名普通的乞丐
that Mr. St. Clair is no ordinary beggar.

771
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:06,769
人们不会料到一个乞丐
People do not expect a beggar

772
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,833
能大量引用莎士比亚
to quote extensively from Shakespeare,

773
00:48:09,418 --> 00:48:10,689
狄更斯先生
Mr. Dickens,

774
00:48:10,726 --> 00:48:11,803
圣经
the Bible

775
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,524
或者最流行的乐曲
or the latest popular songs.

776
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,892
乞丐王子
An aristocrat among beggars.

777
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,955
我知道我不该如此说
Well it is not for me to claim such a distinction

778
00:48:20,957 --> 00:48:24,032
但正如巡官观察所得
but as the Inspector rightly observes

779
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:26,680
我有一份体面的收入
I had a gentlemen's income

780
00:48:26,764 --> 00:48:28,369
因此如绅士般生活
so I proceeded to live like a gentleman.

781
00:48:28,515 --> 00:48:30,849
我在肯特郡买了栋别墅
I bought a villa in Kent

782
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:33,329
娶了一位漂亮
I married a beautiful

783
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:34,404
有身份的女士
and respectable woman

784
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,874
每天早上
and every morning I traveled

785
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:39,877
我进城"上班"
to my business in the city.

786
00:48:40,628 --> 00:48:42,190
此时你肯定和
You must have been embroiled

787
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:43,692
印度人混熟了?
with the lascar by this time?

788
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:46,057
为了使用他楼上的房间
Yes I paid him a generous rent

789
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:48,093
我支付了一大笔租金
for the use of his upstairs rooms.

790
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:50,197
他会守口如瓶
My secret was safe with him.

791
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:52,509
我与窃贼为伍
I fell among thieves

792
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:55,231
却在他们中发现信誉
but found honor of a sort.

793
00:48:57,296 --> 00:48:58,201
每天早晨
You see every morning

794
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:01,465
我化妆成肮脏的乞丐
I would emerge as a squalid beggar

795
00:49:02,768 --> 00:49:03,871
每天晚上
and every evening

796
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:05,931
又换上体面的服装
transformed into a gentleman.

797
00:49:06,991 --> 00:49:09,272
跟我们说说星期一的事
Tell us about Monday.

798
00:49:11,942 --> 00:49:13,161
那天乞讨结束后
I had finished for the day

799
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:15,725
在鸦片馆楼上的
and was dressing in my room

800
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,421
房间里更衣
above the opium den

801
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,891
突然我看出窗外
and suddenly I looked out of the window

802
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:24,164
让我恐惧和吃惊的是
to my horror and astonishment

803
00:49:24,263 --> 00:49:26,535
我妻子在街上
there was my wife in the street.

804
00:49:26,877 --> 00:49:29,631
她目不转睛地看着我
Her eyes fixed full upon me.

805
00:49:29,881 --> 00:49:31,204
内维尔!
Neville!

806
00:49:33,175 --> 00:49:36,031
我赶紧去找那个印度人
I ran along to try and find lascar.

807
00:49:36,563 --> 00:49:38,324
你不能让她进来
You must not let her in.

808
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:40,097
我会告诉她楼上没人
I'll say there is nobody upstairs.

809
00:49:40,191 --> 00:49:41,482
她可能会带警察来
She may return with the police.

810
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:43,566
我会告诉他们楼上没人
I'll tell them there's nobody upstairs.

811
00:49:43,568 --> 00:49:45,517
布恩先生在楼上
Mr. Boone will be upstairs.

812
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:47,445
布恩先生是位房客
Mr. Boone's a lodger.

813
00:49:47,446 --> 00:49:49,113
他有权利待在楼上
He has a right to be upstairs.

814
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,031
内维尔!
Neville!

815
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:53,044
我又再次化妆成
I then became Boone,

816
00:49:53,628 --> 00:49:54,826
乞丐布恩
the beggar once more.

817
00:49:55,097 --> 00:49:56,513
我突然想到
And then it occurred to me

818
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:58,370
警察可能会搜查房间
that there might be a search of the room

819
00:49:59,465 --> 00:50:01,237
我的衣服可能会出卖我
and that my clothes might betray me.

820
00:50:01,487 --> 00:50:03,134
因此我将用于
So I picked up my coat,

821
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:04,885
存放我乞讨收入的
which was weighed down with the coins

822
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:06,260
皮袋子中的硬币
that I had just transferred

823
00:50:06,262 --> 00:50:07,450
塞进大衣里
from my leather bag

824
00:50:07,565 --> 00:50:08,982
以增加重量
in which I carry my takings.

825
00:50:12,558 --> 00:50:15,590
对其他衣服我也打算如法炮制
The rest of my clothes would have followed,

826
00:50:15,591 --> 00:50:17,175
但此时此刻
but at that moment

827
00:50:17,342 --> 00:50:19,093
警察到了
the police arrived.

828
00:50:22,648 --> 00:50:24,003
剩下的事你们也知道了
The rest you know.

829
00:50:26,453 --> 00:50:28,537
我们在窗台上发现血迹
We found blood on the windowsill.

830
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:32,175
在我匆忙打开窗户时
In my haste to open the window

831
00:50:32,259 --> 00:50:33,822
把自己割伤了
I cut myself.

832
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,065
一个小伤
A minor abrasion

833
00:50:38,962 --> 00:50:40,494
除非你戳我
but if you prick me.

834
00:50:42,527 --> 00:50:44,298
因此我因涉嫌
And thus I was arrested

835
00:50:44,299 --> 00:50:46,415
谋杀自己而被捕了
on suspicion of having murdered myself.

836
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:51,412
因此你让你妻子极度痛苦
And thus you caused your wife much anguish.

837
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:52,752
但我给她写了封信
But I wrote her a letter.

838
00:50:52,972 --> 00:50:54,794
而且你让印度人帮你寄出?      是的
And gave it to the lascar to post?        Yes.

839
00:50:54,867 --> 00:50:56,425
但却没有寄出
It was not delivered.

840
00:50:56,464 --> 00:50:57,532
信昨天才寄到
It arrived yesterday.

841
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:01,185
他可能把信交给他的某个水手顾客了
He probably gave it to one of his sailor customers.

842
00:51:04,115 --> 00:51:05,741
我永远无法原谅自己
I shall never forgive myself,

843
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:08,003
让自己的妻子遭受如此痛苦
the agony, which I have inflicted upon my wife.

844
00:51:09,463 --> 00:51:10,859
我可以回家了吗?
Can I go to her now?

845
00:51:11,047 --> 00:51:12,682
我们必须提个条件
I think we must impose one condition

846
00:51:12,684 --> 00:51:13,746
圣克莱尔先生
Mr. St. Clair.

847
00:51:13,747 --> 00:51:14,945
任何条件
Anything.

848
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:18,197
你从此不可再化妆成布恩
There must no be more of you Boone.

849
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,223
我用最郑重的
I swear it by the most solemn oath

850
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:26,079
方式起誓
that a man can take.

851
00:52:02,772 --> 00:52:05,086
永别了 布恩
Farewell sweet Boone.

852
00:52:05,357 --> 00:52:08,400
愿成群的天使们用歌唱抚慰你安息
A flight of angels sends me to thy rest.

853
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:13,404
威廉・莎士比亚
William Shakespeare.

854
