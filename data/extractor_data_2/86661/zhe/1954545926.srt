不过那是很多年前的事情了
but it was some years ago.

80
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,972
嗯 我的丈夫
Well, it's some years

81
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:51,025
他去世也有些年头了

是的

86
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:01,464
我跟他有些浅交
I knew him slightly.

87
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,558
他很出色
He's a splendid fellow.

88
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:07,007

你没听说吗?
You hadn't heard?

94
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:25,278
是的 让人伤心的结局
No, it was a sad ending.

95
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,593

Oh, I'm so sorry,

96
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,045
他看上去是那么充满活力

97
00:08:30,082 --> 00:08:31,930
很难把他和死亡联系在一起
it's hard to connect.

98
00:08:31,967 --> 00:08:34,985
他的感情过于丰富了
He lived too intensely.

99
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:38,104
这一点把他毁了

他就在这房子里头死的

104
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,764
他们说是肺炎
of pneumonia they say

105
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:51,547
是由脾脏破裂引起的
brought on by a ruptured spleen

106
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,222
不过我今天请你们来
but it's not to talk of my grandson

107
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,577
不是要来谈我孙子的
that I asked you here.

108
00:08:56,615 --> 00:08:58,412

我在这房子里住了有一年多

112
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:09,511
过着隐居的生活
leading a retired life.

113
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:13,570
三天前我接到一个房产经纪的电话
Three days ago I had a call from a house agent.

114
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:16,236
钱不是问题 夫人
The money is no object, Madame.

115
00:09:16,273 --> 00:09:20,392
可是附近有好几间待售的屋子呢
But there's several empty houses around here on the market.

116
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:26,624
不 就要这间 我的委托人对这间屋子情有独钟
No, this, my client's heart is set on this one.

117
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:28,798
你开个价好吗?
Will you name your price?

118
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:33,311
我开的价比买进价高了500英镑
I suggested 500 pounds more than I gave for it.

119
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,517
他说他的委托人...
He said that his client...

120
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,464
我的委托人还想连家具一起买
My client desires to buy the furniture as well.

121
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:39,667
全部家具吗?
All of it?

122
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:40,878
是的
Everything.

123
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,588
有些家具可是上等质地的啊
But some of it's very good.

124
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,639
尽管开价就行 Maberley太太
Just state your price, Mrs. Maberley.

125
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:51,828
于是我就开了个高价 他马上就答应了
So I did, a good round sum and he agreed at once.

126
00:09:51,865 --> 00:09:55,966
我一直希望有可能的话能去周游世界
You see I've always wanted to travel around the world if I could.

127
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:59,029
这也是我先生的遗愿
It's a legacy left to me by my dear Mortimer.

128
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:02,115
我们从未实现过
No less, we never really achieved it.

129
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:05,538
那人第二天回来时 是不是把协议都起草好了?
The man returned the next day with everything drawn up?

130
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:11,108
就是昨天的事 幸好我把协议 给我的律师Sutro先生看了
Yesterday, luckily I showed it to Mr. Sutro, my lawyer.

131
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,392
真是怪事
This is very strange.

132
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:18,086
你有没有注意到 协议不许你带走房子里的任何东西
Are you aware that you cannot take anything out of the house

133
00:10:18,277 --> 00:10:21,110
甚至是你个人的财产也不行?
not even your own personal possessions?

134
00:10:21,147 --> 00:10:23,440
我的衣服也不行吗?
Not my clothes,

135
00:10:23,477 --> 00:10:24,682
还有我的珠宝?
my jewelry?

136
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:26,223
什么都不行
Anything.

137
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,615
那个人再来的时候
When the man returned to the house

138
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:28,824
您有没有向他指出这一点?
you pointed this out?

139
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,190
有的
Yes.

140
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:33,653
他说我可以带走一些个人的东西
He said I might take some personal effects

141
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,111
但是要带走的东西 一律得经过检查
but that nothing should go out of this house unchecked.

142
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:41,404
我的委托人很慷慨
My client is very liberal

143
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,162
但有些怪癖 夫人
but has fads, Madame,

144
00:10:44,664 --> 00:10:46,685
做事情有他自己的方式
and a way of doing things.

145
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,611
你的东西嘛 我的委托人要么就全要
I'm afraid it must be everything

146
00:10:50,648 --> 00:10:53,406
要么就全部都不要
or nothing for my client.

147
00:10:53,645 --> 00:10:55,523
那就全都不要好了
Then it must be nothing.

148
00:10:58,689 --> 00:10:59,980
这就是他的名片
Here it is.

149
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:05,079
Haines Johnson 拍卖估价师 没有留下地址
Haines Johnson, auctioneer valuer no address.

150
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:07,457
我怀疑我们能否在号码本里找到他
I doubt we shall find him in the directory,

151
00:11:07,494 --> 00:11:10,930
诚实的人不会隐瞒自己的地址的
honest men don't conceal their place of business.

152
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,557
对于偷听的来说 你的喘息声太大了
Just a little wheezy for eavesdropping.

153
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:33,148
我只不过想进来问问
I just came in to find out

154
00:11:33,185 --> 00:11:36,927
客人们是否会留下来用午餐 夫人
if the visitors were staying for lunch, Madame.

155
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:38,881
别逼我用这个
Don't force me to use this.

156
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,730
Maberley太太
Mrs. Maberley, did you mention to anyone

157
00:11:41,276 --> 00:11:44,196
您有没有跟别人说起过要向我咨询的事?
that you were going to consult me?

158
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,134
没有 福尔摩斯先生
I did not, Mr. Holmes.

159
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,249
信是谁寄的?
Who posted the letter?

160
00:11:48,285 --> 00:11:49,437
Susan
Susan did.

161
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:50,497
Susan?
Susan?

162
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:53,131
哈 你把消息透露给谁了?
Ah, to whom did you send your message?

163
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,037
我没有向别人透露什么消息
I sent no message.

164
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:56,343
告诉我
Tell me?

165
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,833
Susan 我记起来了
Susan, I remember now,

166
00:11:58,869 --> 00:12:01,753
我看见你在篱笆那里跟人说话来着
I saw you speaking to someone over the hedge.

167
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,886
那是我的私事 夫人
That was my own business, Madame.

168
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,289
是Barney Stockdale
Barney Stockdale.

169
00:12:07,114 --> 00:12:08,955
怎么可能
Fine chance that would be.

170
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:11,234
我都不认识他
I didn't even know the man.

171
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,108
要是你告诉我 这事是谁在背后搞的鬼
It is worth 10 pounds to you

172
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,295
我给你10英镑
if you tell me who is at the back of this.

173
00:12:16,332 --> 00:12:19,153
你的10英镑的消息
Someone who could lay down 1,000 pounds

174
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,875
有人可愿意花上1000镑呢
for every 10 you've got in the world.

175
00:12:21,912 --> 00:12:25,440
我看见一个有钱人在微笑
I see a rich man who smiled,

176
00:12:25,476 --> 00:12:26,950
是一个有钱的女人
a rich woman.

177
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:31,652
把名字告诉我 你就可以把钱拿去
Tell me the name and earn the money.

178
00:12:32,479 --> 00:12:36,238
我要先看到你下地狱
I'll see you in hell first.

179
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:42,062
明天我派人来取我的箱子 夫人
I'll send for my box tomorrow, Madame.

180
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,903
这群团伙出现意味着有猫腻
This gang means business.

181
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,230
可是他们想要什么呢?
But what can they possibly want?

182
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,080
Maberley太太
Mrs. Maberley,

183
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,425
您说您在这房子里住了有一年了?
you say you've been in this house for a year?

184
00:12:53,462 --> 00:12:54,467
差不多两年
Nearly two.

185
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,842
这么说 近两年来
So for nearly two years

186
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,108
没人对这房子 有什么特别的兴趣
no one has taken any particular interest in the house

187
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,061
然而就在三四天前 突然就有人这么急需
and yet suddenly within three or four days

188
00:13:03,098 --> 00:13:06,599
这房子和里头的东西
urgent demands are made for it and its contents.

189
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:09,553
房子里肯定添置了什么新的东西
Something new must've been brought into the house.

190
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,557
没有 我有一年多没买什么新东西了
No, I haven't bought anything new for a year.

191
00:13:13,594 --> 00:13:18,158
这个Susan来这儿多久了?
This, Susan, how long has she been with you?

192
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,225
大概三个星期
Almost three weeks.

193
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,322
就在你孙子死后吗?
Since your grandson's death?

194
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:25,078
他去世一星期后的事
A week after.

195
00:13:28,487 --> 00:13:30,939
她向我自荐
She presented herself

196
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,977
而我就雇佣了她
and I took her in I suppose

197
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,408
呃 也没有什么介绍信
without proper reference.

198
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:37,898
这蛋糕很好吃
You know, this cake is delicious.

199
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:46,892
能说说 您孙子从意大利回来的情形吗?
Please, now will you tell us about the circumstances of your grandson's return to Italy?

200
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:49,096
我那多情的孩子
My gallant boy.

201
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:54,231
你也许还记得 他曾是一个 多么快活 优秀的人吧 华生医生
You may remember him as debonair and splendid, Dr. Watson.

202
00:13:54,808 --> 00:13:56,781
你都没有看到
You didn't see the morose

203
00:13:56,818 --> 00:13:59,317
他变得多么郁郁寡欢心事重重
and brooding creature he became.

204
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,335
他的心都碎了
His heart was broken.

205
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,131
一月之间
In a single month

206
00:14:05,168 --> 00:14:10,398
我看着他变成了一个衰弱又愤世嫉俗的人
I watched him turn into a worn out cynical man.

207
00:14:12,111 --> 00:14:13,200
女人吗?
A woman?

208
00:14:15,573 --> 00:14:17,610
他不肯说
He wouldn't speak of it.

209
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:23,975
他说他怕让他的奶奶也跟着烦恼
He was afraid of upsetting his grandma he said.

210
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:28,282
那您一直都不知道她的名字了?
And so you never learnt her name?

211
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:40,895
今晚最好能有人
It might be advisable

212
00:14:40,932 --> 00:14:42,886
跟您呆在一起
for someone to stay with you tonight.

213
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:43,969
华生?
Watson?

214
00:14:44,006 --> 00:14:45,714
好的 没问题
Yes, of course.

215
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:53,146
不 我真的不能麻烦你
No, I really couldn't ask such a thing.

216
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,828
不不不 我们要走了
No, no, no, we're leaving.

217
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:58,451
谢谢 Maberley太太
Thank you, Mrs. Maberley,

218
00:14:59,373 --> 00:15:00,843
我天黑前回来
I shall be back before dark,

219
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,806
您别担心
don't concern yourself.

220
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,802
也许要找到这个人才行
It might be useful to find this

221
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,320
她叫什么?  Violet吗?
what's she called, Violet.

222
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,822
他也许向她透露了什么事情
He may have confided something to her

223
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,923
他到死也没有
that he didn't tell his grandmother

224
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,851
跟他奶奶说起的事情
in his last hours.

225
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,624
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

226
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:43,812
下午好 Dixie先生
Good Afternoon Mr. Dixie.

227
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,925
那老太太和她的房子
The old lady and the house

228
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:50,409
都在我的保护之下
are both under my protection

229
00:15:50,446 --> 00:15:53,173
你可别忘了
and don't you forget it.

230
00:15:59,121 --> 00:16:00,632
看看他们是不是走了
Make sure they're gone.

231
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,831
今晚带上你的手枪
Bring your revolver tonight.

232
00:16:35,526 --> 00:16:38,313
D代表Douglas Maberley
D, Douglas Maberley,

233
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,218
出色 快活
splendid, debonair,

234
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:41,999
同时又阴郁 愤世嫉俗
too morose, cynical,

235
00:16:42,036 --> 00:16:44,312
好重的词
strong words.

236
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:49,038
噢 不
Oh, no,

237
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,001
这个没有眼睛的女士是谁?
who is this lady with no eyes?

238
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,982
我们去那边查
Our course lies there.

239
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,456
应该是样连她自己都不知道 已经在手上的东西
There must be something she doesn't know she has.

240
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,685
就算她知道 也许也不肯告诉我们
And probably wouldn't tell us even if she did know.

241
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:13,017
这案子要找Langdale Pike
This is a case for Langdale Pike.

242
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:14,320
那个卑鄙的无赖
That reptile.

243
00:17:14,357 --> 00:17:16,135
胡说
Nonsense, don't talk rubbish.

244
00:17:16,172 --> 00:17:17,668
他是个爱讲闲话的人
He's a gossip,

245
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,607
但是...也许他能指认出那个贵妇人
but he might identify this rich woman.

246
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,048
真是令人难过 他在大学的时候可是很出色的
Sad, he was brilliant at university,

247
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,303
我总觉得 在他外表之下
and you know, I've always felt that under that veneer

248
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,494
藏着一颗孤独的心
that he was totally isolated.

249
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,794
就像我
Like me.

250
00:17:32,831 --> 00:17:34,181
你看到了吗?
You see that?

251
00:17:35,175 --> 00:17:37,606
那边在树下的女孩
That young girl there, under the tree,

252
00:17:38,343 --> 00:17:40,138
戴着一顶应景的帽子
with the occasional hat,

253
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:42,106
你觉得她在干嘛?
what do you make of her?

254
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:44,559
她在找她的狗
She's looking for her dog.

255
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,572
什么?
What?

256
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:51,729
-不 当然不是 -一条萨卢基狗
-No, no, surely. -A saluki,

257
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,065
也许戴着松绿色的项圈
with a turquoise collar perhaps.

258
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:58,253
她对这公园很陌生
She's a stranger in the park

259
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,191
她的狗也是
so is the dog.

260
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:03,692
它来了
There it is now.

261
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,541
你怎么知道的?
How did you know that?

262
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:12,601
她的靴子是乡村款式的
Her boots are country boots

263
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,150
但已经不够结实
but not so robust,

264
00:18:14,188 --> 00:18:16,503
说明她来自崎岖的丘陵地区
as to suggest a rough terrain.

265
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,952
Wiltshire来的
Wiltshire,

266
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:20,404
也许是来自Gloucestershire
Gloucestershire perhaps.

267
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,770
是的 是的 但是...
Yes, yes, yes, but,

268
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:26,927
你有没有发现她很迷人?
don't you find her attractive?

269
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:30,809
好吧
All right.

270
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,514
为什么是一条萨卢基狗?
Why saluki?

271
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:35,542
人们常说"狗似主人形"
Owners are meant to look like their dogs, they say,

272
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,754
难道不就是萨卢基了吗?
wouldn't you say, saluki?

273
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,869
厉害
Remarkable.

274
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:42,702
事实上
She is in point of fact,

275
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,093
她是Geraldine Windridge小姐
Lady Geraldine Windridge

276
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:50,699
来自Wiltshire的Marlborough家的近亲
the close Marlborough, Wiltshire.

277
00:18:52,434 --> 00:18:55,807
现在说说 亲爱的福尔摩斯 你找我干嘛来了?
And now my, dear Holmes, what is it you want from me?

278
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,874
是关于已故的Douglas Maberley
The late Douglas Maberley.

279
00:19:00,547 --> 00:19:01,810
可怜的孩子
Poor boy,

280
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:05,150
真是可惜了
and what a waste.

281
00:19:07,281 --> 00:19:09,334
他与一位女士有染
He was involved with a lady

282
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,884
一位贵妇人
a well placed rich lady.

283
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:14,238
你知道吗?
Known to you?

284
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,083
你有什么可以交换的吗
Have you something to trade,

285
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,225
有来有往?
tittle for tattle?

286
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:44,343
Langdale 我很急的
Langdale, I'm in a hurry.

287
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:50,885
嗯 谢谢
Hmm, thank you.

288
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,943
她名叫Isadora Klein
Her name is Isadora Klein.

289
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,915
啊 没错 是德国糖业大王的遗孀
Ah, yes, widow of the German sugar king,

290
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,045
相当出名的一位美人儿
quite a celebrated beauty.

291
00:19:59,082 --> 00:20:01,148
著名的美人儿
The celebrated beauty.

292
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:08,995
她和年轻的Lomond公爵订了婚
She's engaged to be married

293
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,635
就要结婚了
to the youthful Duke of Lomond.

294
00:20:12,706 --> 00:20:14,072
Pike还告诉你什么了
What else did Pike tell you,

295
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,479
有没有告诉你她和Maberley的事?
anything about her and Maberley?

296
00:20:15,516 --> 00:20:16,542
没有
Nothing.

297
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:19,495
福尔摩斯
I wonder, Holmes,

298
00:20:20,153 --> 00:20:23,426
你觉得有没有可能 她想拿回一些有损声名的信件?
do you think it could be about some compromising letters she wants retrieved,

299
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:26,759
特别是会影响她即将举行的婚礼的信件
I mean particularly in view of her forthcoming marriage.

300
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:27,776
你是说情信吗?
You mean love letters?

301
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:31,253
不 不 应该不止这样
No, no, it's deeper than that.

302
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,884
听着 我要你
Listen, I demand that you spend

303
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:36,971
在三角墙山庄
a sleepless night

304
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,432
彻夜守候
at the Three Gables

305
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:41,236
枪不离手
with that revolver at hand.

306
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,885
你今晚怎么过?
How will you be spending the evening?

307
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:47,824
从另一个角度追踪这个案件
Pursuing the matter from another angle,

308
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:50,397

她声称是被歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生撵走的

歇洛克.福尔摩斯
Sherlock Holmes,

00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,875
那是因为你的要求不够强硬

歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生在调查这个案子了

侦破疑案很出名 没错

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,075
可是对付女人呢?
but for women?

00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:41,324
你还欠我一个人情 伙计 你记得吗?
You still owe me a favor dear boy, remember?

330
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,645
你要是不还我人情
I shan't destroy the paper

331
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,214
那张纸我可不撕掉
until you've returned the compliment,

332
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,982
还记得吧 有来有往?

333
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,659
看看你 到底怎么啦?
Look at you, I mean what's all this?

狂欢已经开始了

338
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,704
噢 这么多人
Oh, so many people,

339
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,009
却如此没有目标
so little purpose.

340
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:12,170
那是上帝的谜题
That's God's conundrum.

341
00:23:12,906 --> 00:23:15,519
要是我们这样的凡夫俗子能回答就好了
If only we mortals could answer that.

342
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,572
那你的生活也没什么意思了
Then your life would have no meaning.

343

真实却又残酷  残酷但很真实

我秘而不宣的事比我透露的可是多得多
I suppress much, much more than I expose,

348
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:41,116
否则 这世界会怎样呢?

她是哪一位?

00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:17,135
也希望得到一切

老天啊 你都碰上什么事了?
Good Lord, what have you got into?

463
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:15,042
发生了什么事?
What happened?

464
00:33:16,073 --> 00:33:17,543
太太说你一到她就要见你
Madame says she wants to see you

465
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,764
福尔摩斯先生
as soon as you arrive, Mr. Holmes, sir.

466
00:33:22,128 --> 00:33:25,412
福尔摩斯 她现在很虚弱
Holmes, she's in a very frail condition.

467
00:33:27,811 --> 00:33:30,890
医生 先医好你自己再说吧
Physician, heal thyself.

468
00:33:41,465 --> 00:33:44,854
福尔摩斯先生 你可真好
Mr. Holmes, how good of you.

469
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,137
您觉得怎么样?
How are you feeling?

470
00:33:48,618 --> 00:33:50,762
呃 我还活着
Well, I'm alive

471
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,717
多亏了您勇敢的朋友 华生医生
thanks to your brave friend Dr. Watson.

472
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:55,941
他把它从他们手里夺回来了吗?
Did he get it back from them?

473
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:57,688
夺回什么?
Get what?

474
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:00,952
噢 对了 你还不知道 我没有...
Oh, of course you wouldn't know. I don't...

475
00:34:01,852 --> 00:34:04,642
福尔摩斯先生 我得向您道歉
Mr. Holmes I owe you an apology.

476
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,636
我原先希望它跟这件事无关 可它真的有关
I prayed it would have no bearing but it does.

477
00:34:10,805 --> 00:34:13,710
我真是太蠢了
Oh, it's so stupid of me.

478
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,979
它就是一切的根源
It's the reason for everything.

479
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:22,624
Douglas在写书
Douglas was writing a book.

480
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,309
他说书里会解释一切
He said it would explain it all.

481
00:34:25,346 --> 00:34:27,627
他在罗马的时候开始提笔
He started it in Rome

482
00:34:27,664 --> 00:34:30,929
后来他们把他送回这里后
and later when they brought him back here,

483
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:36,008
他就在那个通风的避暑亭里 坐上几个小时写东西
he sat for hours in that drafty little summer house,

484
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:39,498
甚至在十分糟糕的天气里
writing sometimes in the most dreadful weather.

485
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,080
后来他连床都起不来了
And later when he could no longer leave his room,

486
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:53,627
可他还是挣扎着写他的书
he still struggled with it.

487
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,918
有两本
Two copies,

488
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:01,264
一本他给了Violet
one he gave to Violet

489
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,253
要她把书寄给某个人
and told her to deliver it to someone.

490
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,473
我不知道是谁
I don't know who.

491
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:10,717
他要她发誓保密的
He had sworn her to secrecy,

492
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:13,663
而她也信守诺言
and she kept her promise.

493
00:35:14,852 --> 00:35:16,480
另外一本
The other copy,

494
00:35:16,517 --> 00:35:18,153
他催促我
he urged me,

495
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:20,514
几乎用尽他的最后一口气
almost with his dying breath

496
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,033
要我把它拿给他的出版商
to send it to his publisher.

497
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:49,368
我本来是要这么做的
I should've done so

498
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:53,037
不过就在他下葬的那一夜
but on the night of his funeral,

499
00:35:53,074 --> 00:35:57,362
我太想念他了 于是就把整本书都看了
and missing him so much I read it through.

500
00:35:58,076 --> 00:36:02,217
我马上就知道那本书是什么了 那是他的一生
I knew at once what it was, his life.

501
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:04,736
还有那个女人
That woman,

502
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:07,308
我甚至连她的名字都不知道
I didn't even know her name.

503
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,852
想到这本书会引发的丑闻
The scandal it would cause

504
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:15,948
我就把它埋在了心底
and I shut it out of my mind,

505
00:36:15,985 --> 00:36:17,411
锁了起来
locked it away,

506
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:21,752
昨天晚上是华生医生让我想起了它
and then last night when Dr. Watson reminded me.

507
00:36:21,789 --> 00:36:23,507
当时他们在等你吗?
And they were waiting for you?

508
00:36:23,544 --> 00:36:27,923
是的 他们把它从我手里抢走
Yes, and they snatched it from me

509
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,327
当时我想把它拿上去给医生看的
as I was taking it up to him.

510
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:36,656
只有这张没有拿走
All but this.

511
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:48,147
我从那个畜生手上撕下来的
I tore it from the brute.

512
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:02,442
它在哪?
Where is it?

513
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,628
它在哪?
Where is it?

514
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:05,107
Miguel
Miguel.

515
00:37:05,145 --> 00:37:06,907
Miguel
Miguel.

516
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:11,457
最后一页 最后一页在哪儿?
The page, where is the last page?

517
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:14,085
他拿了 我知道 是他拿了
He has it, I know he has it.

518
00:37:14,122 --> 00:37:15,867
一页纸 Carina
One page, Carina,

519
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,705
就算是福尔摩斯也不能...
not even Sherlock Holmes can do anything with...

520
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,968
把它烧了 别说了 把它烧了
Burn it, Don't talk, burn it.

521
00:37:27,819 --> 00:37:28,950
脸上淌着血
Face bled,

522
00:37:28,987 --> 00:37:32,694
那些无情的殴打 让他的腹中好像被火烧着一般
his stomach burned from the savage blows

523
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:37,772
可这些比起他滴血的心来说 根本算不得什么
but it was nothing to the bleeding of his heart

524
00:37:37,809 --> 00:37:40,379
当他看见她那可爱的脸庞
when he saw that lovely face,

525
00:37:41,316 --> 00:37:45,809
一张他愿意为之牺牲一切的脸庞
a face, which he had been prepared to sacrifice his life for.

526
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,527
她在笑
She smiled,

527
00:37:47,564 --> 00:37:49,914
是的 苍天可鉴 她在微笑
yes by heavens, she smiled

528
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,557
就像是个无情的魔鬼
like the heartless fiend she was.

529
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:54,150
就在那一刻
It was at that moment

530
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:57,702
爱情死去了
that love died,

531
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:00,138
憎恨却萌生了
and hate was born.

532
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:04,529
如果不是为了你的怀抱
If it is not for your embrace my lady,

533
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:07,107
那就是为你的毁灭!  我的夫人
then it shall be for your undoing

534
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:10,131
为了我彻底的复仇
and my complete revenge.

535
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:14,805
我彻底的复仇
My complete revenge,

536
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:17,994
书里的"他"变成了"我"
The he becomes my.

537
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:23,988
作者把自己想象为男主人公
Yes, the writer imagines himself the hero.

538
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,622
有两本
Two copies,

539
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,902
一本给了Klein夫人
one to Mrs. Klein.

540
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:31,043
而这本则要出版
And this for publication.

541
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:35,478
整个伦敦都会认出
All London would recognize,

542
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,649
人物的原型
the wool from the lamb.

543
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,057
甜蜜的复仇
Sweet revenge.

544
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:43,119
再把第一句读来听听
Read me that first sentence again.

545
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,433
脸上淌着血
Face bled,

546
00:38:44,914 --> 00:38:48,764
那些无情的殴打 让他的腹中好像被火烧着一般
his stomach burned from the savage blow.

547
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:50,471
这就是死因
The cause of death.

548
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:59,657
那老太太说肺炎是脾脏破裂引起的
Pneumonia from a ruptured spleen the old woman said.

549
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:01,772
天哪
Good heavens,

550
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,880
被踢破的
ruptured from a kick,

551
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,552
那是谋杀
that's murder.

552
00:39:06,268 --> 00:39:07,841
可是我们无法证明
We could never prove it.

553
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,523
我要去Cricklewood
I'm leaving for Cricklewood.

554
00:39:18,321 --> 00:39:19,503
Steve
Steve,

555
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:22,889
五个月前的Grover广场?
Grover's Square five months ago?

556
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:25,587
那不是我 福尔摩斯先生
That wasn't me, Mr. Holmes.

557
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:27,134
你不能把那栽在我头上
You can't put that on me.

558
00:39:27,171 --> 00:39:29,434
是谁的靴子踢死了Douglas Maberley
It doesn't matter whose boot

559
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,371
也不要紧吗?
killed Douglas Maberley,

560
00:39:32,408 --> 00:39:34,642
你们都是有罪的
you're all guilty.

561
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:37,943
哈 Susan
Ha, Susan,

562
00:39:40,761 --> 00:39:44,216
Susan 在你丈夫坐牢的时候
Susan, guarding the coop

563
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,862
看着你的鸡舍吧
while your husband is in prison.

564
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:50,336
新来的是谁 Barney Stockdale太太?
What's the new member Mrs. Barney Stockdale?

565
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:51,432
哦 是的
Oh, yes.

566
00:39:51,469 --> 00:39:53,427
小心点 福尔摩斯
Take care, Holmes.

567
00:39:53,465 --> 00:39:56,767
你们从这滚出去
You get out of here.

568
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:58,940
那女人会让你坐牢的
That woman will put you behind bars

569
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:00,947
就为你昨晚做的那事
for what you did last night.

570
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,103
而她的雇主
And her employer,

571
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,039
Grosvenor广场的Klein太太
Mrs. Klein of Grosvenor Square

572
00:40:05,076 --> 00:40:07,469
会看着你们全都因谋杀罪而被绞死
will see you all hanged for murder

573
00:40:07,506 --> 00:40:11,792
除非你照我说的去做
unless you do what I tell you, when I tell you.

574
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:15,582
记住 Hobin的Perkins
Remember, Perkins of Hobin.

575
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:18,159
华生
Watson.

576
00:40:28,965 --> 00:40:30,314
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

577
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,837
你看到什么了?
What do you see?

578
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,327
我看到了
I see,

579
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,161
我爱慕的女人
the woman I adore.

580
00:41:15,802 --> 00:41:17,151
我准备好了
I'm ready now.

581
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:18,144
用不着 你就呆在这儿吧
No stay here,

582
00:41:19,022 --> 00:41:21,934
她又不是Moriarty教授 她只不过是个女人
she's not Moriarty, she's a woman.

583
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:23,833
那只手需要补偿
That hand needs redressing.

584
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,991
记住 福尔摩斯
Just remember, Holmes,

585
00:41:37,915 --> 00:41:41,294
女人可以比男人更致命
the female can be more deadly than the male.

586
00:41:55,232 --> 00:41:59,800
估价师和拍卖人 哼
Valuer and auctioneer, my foot.

587
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,541
啊 夫人
Ah, Madame.

588
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:09,495
又是你 福尔摩斯
You again, Holmes.

589
00:42:09,532 --> 00:42:11,357
要是你有什么要对我的新娘说的
If you have something to say to my bride,

590
00:42:11,394 --> 00:42:14,320
在我把你踢出去之前赶紧说吧
speak out before I kick you out.

591
00:42:14,357 --> 00:42:18,884
不 我正在等福尔摩斯先生呢 让我们单独谈谈
No, I have been expecting Mr. Holmes, leave us.

592
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:21,395
我不打算让你跟这个...
I have no intention of leaving you with this...

593
00:42:21,433 --> 00:42:23,238
去吧 James
Go, James.

594
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,186
走啊
Go.

595
00:42:29,879 --> 00:42:32,296
我很意外 你竟拖了这么久才来
I'm only surprised it took you so long.

596
00:42:32,334 --> 00:42:36,371
我意外的是 你竟然以为子弹就可以恐吓我
I am surprised that you thought bullies could frighten me.

597
00:42:37,015 --> 00:42:39,209
要是危险对我没有吸引力的话
No man would take up my profession

598
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,745
我也不会干这一行
if danger did not attract him.

599
00:43:00,395 --> 00:43:01,714
您是一位绅士
You're a gentleman,

600
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,167
我会把您当朋友的
I will treat you as my friend.

601
00:43:04,205 --> 00:43:07,139
我可无法保证会对此作出回报
I cannot promise to reciprocate.

602
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,058
毫无疑问
No doubt it was foolish

603
00:43:11,096 --> 00:43:14,036
威胁您这么勇敢的一个人是很蠢的
to threaten such a brave man as yourself.

604
00:43:14,072 --> 00:43:15,519
不 蠢的是
No, what was really foolish

605
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:18,184
像您这么一位聪明的女士
for an intelligent woman like you

606
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,450
竟然会让自己跟一群流氓掺和在一起
is to place yourself in the power

607
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:24,857
他们可是擅于勒索 也许还会出卖您
of a band of rascals who could blackmail, or give you away.

608
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:28,613
不不 我可不是这么头脑简单的人
No, no, I'm not so simple.

609
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,586
他们当中
None of them have the least idea

610
00:43:30,623 --> 00:43:32,833
没人知道是谁雇佣了他们
who their employer is.

611
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,865
Barney Stockdale和他的妻子也不知道?
Not Barney Stockdale and his wife?

612
00:43:37,483 --> 00:43:39,010
他们都是很好的猎犬
They are good hounds,

613
00:43:39,484 --> 00:43:40,578
能够保守秘密
who run silent.

614
00:43:40,615 --> 00:43:43,216
还愿意为你去坐牢吗?
And are prepared to go to prison for you?

615
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,671
他们安之若素
They take what comes,

616
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,457
他们拿了钱就该这样做
that's what they're paid for.

617
00:43:49,576 --> 00:43:57,201
而Haines Johnson先生 噢 当然了 这不是他的真名
And Mr. Haines- Johnson oh surely that is not his name,

618
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,807
他拿了钱又该干什么事?
what is he paid for?

619
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:05,830
Miguel 他对我就像兄弟一样亲
Miguel, he's like a brother to me.

620
00:44:07,971 --> 00:44:10,361
至于其他人嘛 他们都是干活的
As for the others they work

621
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,591
而在这件事中我从来没有露过面
and I do not appear in the matter.

622
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:14,629
除非我把你牵扯进去
Unless I bring you into it.

623
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:19,967
可您是位绅士 福尔摩斯先生
But you're a gentleman, Mr. Holmes,

624
00:44:20,455 --> 00:44:23,120
您会尊重一位女士的隐私
you respect a woman's secret.

625
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:26,667
哼 谋杀也是隐私吗?
Huh, is murder a woman's secret?

626
00:44:31,223 --> 00:44:32,345
谋杀?
Murder?

627
00:44:35,665 --> 00:44:37,133
我的脸上淌着血
My face bled,

628
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,801
那些无情的殴打
my stomach burned,

629
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:42,521
打得他的腹中好像火烧一般
from the savage blows

630
00:44:42,557 --> 00:44:44,629
可是比起我滴血的心 那不算什么
but it was nothing to the bleeding of my heart,

631
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,288
第245页
page 245.

632
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,004
还有一位目击证人 Klein夫人
And there's a witness, Mrs. Klein,

633
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,979
就是职业拳手Steve Dixie
the prizefighter Steve Dixie

634
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:59,728
他将指证你
who will testify against you.

635
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:04,547
这些你都告诉我未来的婆婆了吗?
And all this, you told my future mother-in-law?

636
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,880
我跟她说了什么并不重要
What, I told the Dowager is of no importance

637
00:45:06,918 --> 00:45:09,884
因为她无法阻止你跟她儿子的婚姻
since she cannot prevent your marriage to her son.

638
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,866
是的 她是没有办法
No, she cannot.

639
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:14,568
而你觉得你可以吗?
And you believe that you can.

640
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:16,364
是的
Oh, yes.

641
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:19,183
你为什么要这样做呢?
Why should you wish to?

642
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:24,980
是因为我是个外国人吗?
Is it because I'm a foreigner?

643
00:45:27,585 --> 00:45:31,098
你也像那些英国佬一样 是个势利鬼吗 福尔摩斯先生?
Are you an English snob, Mr. Holmes?

644
00:45:31,723 --> 00:45:33,319
我来告诉你吧
Let me tell you,

645
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,141
我们的人几代都是
my people have been leaders in Pernambuco

646
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,262
Pernambuco的领袖
for generations.

647
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:40,849
夫人
Madam,

648
00:45:42,653 --> 00:45:47,103
你是Andalusia 一位吉普赛人的私生子
you are the bastard child of a gypsy in Andalusia.

649
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,102
你这婊子养的!
<i>Hijo de puta!</i>

650
00:45:56,404 --> 00:45:57,953
是谁告诉你的?
Who told you?

651
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:01,045
是我交换来的
It is my trade.

652
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:09,527
你必须把手稿给我
Now you must give me the manuscript.

653
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:13,065
不 不 不
No, no, no.

654
00:46:14,974 --> 00:46:18,339
你想得到纸袋里的灰烬吗?
Do you wish for ashes in a paper bag?

655
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,157
你对我太苛刻了
You are hard to me,

656
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,229
看着我的眼睛
look at it with my eyes.

657
00:46:28,266 --> 00:46:30,682
一生的抱负就要被你毁了
A life's ambition about to be ruined.

658
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,037
那是你的原罪
The original sin was yours.

659
00:46:33,075 --> 00:46:35,364
是的 我认识Douglas
Yes, I know Douglas.

660
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:38,143
是的 我真的爱他
Yes, I did love him truly.

661
00:46:38,878 --> 00:46:42,050
是的 我确实爱过一阵子
Yes, yes, I did for a while,

662
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,789
以我的方式爱着他
in my fashion.

663
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:45,899
可是他要的是婚姻
But he wanted marriage,

664
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:47,931
这是他唯一想要的
nothing less would serve him.

665
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,774
但这个并不符合我的计划
It did not fit with my plans.

666
00:46:50,812 --> 00:46:54,958
于是你就雇了些流氓殴打他
And so you hired ruffians to beat him

667
00:46:54,994 --> 00:46:57,301
直到他在你的窗下奄奄一息
until he was nearly dead under your own window,

668
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,065
难道这能算是淑女的所为吗?
is that the act of a lady?

669
00:46:59,102 --> 00:47:01,759
没错 Barney跟那些男孩
Yes, it is true Barney and the boys

670
00:47:01,796 --> 00:47:05,014
赶他走的时候也许是有些粗野
drove him away perhaps a little too roughly.

671
00:47:07,243 --> 00:47:08,788
可他之后干了什么?
What did he do then,

672
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:11,887
他写了本书
he wrote a book.

673
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:14,883
对我进行恶毒地人身攻击
A vicious personal attack.

674
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,589
那能算是绅士的所为吗?
Is that the act of a gentleman?

675
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:23,292
你知道他的出版商并没有收到这本书?
You knew his publisher had not received it?

676
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:24,101
是的
Yes.

677
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:27,425
那它就应该还在他奶奶的房子里
So it had to be in the house of his grandmother.

678
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,198
只要这本书存在
As long as that book existed

679
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,905
我就不可能安全
there was no safety for me.

680
00:47:35,158 --> 00:47:38,190
我想诚心地做这件事
I wanted to do this thing honestly.

681
00:47:39,277 --> 00:47:43,292
我接受了她开出的任何价格
I offered any price she cared to ask

682
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:46,052
可她不接受
but she wouldn't take it.

683
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,644
难道保护自己也要受到谴责吗?
Are we to be blamed for protecting ourselves?

684
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,354
有一件事让我感兴趣
One thing intrigues me,

685
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:03,075
为什么像你这么一位
why a woman as lovely as you

686
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:07,343
能把男人掌握于股掌之中的美丽女士
who wields such power over men

687
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:13,166
也需要别人的保护呢?
needs the protection of anyone?

688
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:21,518
现实才不在乎我们
Nature doesn't give a damn for any of us.

689
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:26,757
我爱James
I love James,

690
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:29,135
我想要他
and I want him.

691
00:48:30,815 --> 00:48:32,643
他代表着
He represents,

692
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,164
我想要的一切
all I've ever desired

693
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:39,125
这是我获得某种安全感的
and my one chance

694
00:48:39,954 --> 00:48:42,468
一个机会
of a kind of security,

695
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,659
这种安全感 我称之为幸福
which I call happiness

696
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:51,319
而你却要把它从我这儿夺走
and you would take it away from me.

697
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:55,214
为什么?
Why?

698
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,249
为什么?
Why?

699
00:49:04,962 --> 00:49:06,206
为什么?
Why?

700
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,252
因为你是男人的毁灭者
Because you are a destroyer of men.

701
00:49:09,788 --> 00:49:11,262
噢 是的
Oh yes.

702
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:14,488
你毁掉了Douglas Maberley
You destroyed Douglas Maberley

703
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:18,937
还差点毁掉了我的朋友约翰 华生
and very nearly my friend John Watson

704
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:21,142
用你那种为了自身的利益...
with the ruthless disregard

705
00:49:21,178 --> 00:49:24,728
...而不顾一切的漠然
for anything but your own selfish interest.

706
00:49:24,766 --> 00:49:27,368
为什么在你这儿就不成功了呢?
Why have I failed with you?

707
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:30,779
我的要求只有这个...
I require only this

708
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:35,617
我要读到你跟Lomond公爵解除婚约的消息
that I read of the breaking of your engagement to the Duke of Lomond

709
00:49:35,654 --> 00:49:37,498
在星期四早上之前
by Thursday morning.

710
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,455
要是我不答应呢?
And if I refuse?

711
00:49:40,492 --> 00:49:41,726
苏格兰场
Scotland Yard,

712
00:49:41,763 --> 00:49:44,993
会展开对证人的全面调查
a full investigation with witnesses.

713
00:49:46,262 --> 00:49:48,056
我听你发落
I'm at your mercy,

714
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:49,809
你这个混蛋
<i>Haz de me lopeor</i>

715
00:49:49,846 --> 00:49:51,352
悉听尊便
Do your worst.

716
00:49:52,495 --> 00:49:56,220
噢 坐头等舱去环游世界
Oh, how much does it cost to go around the world

717
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:57,609
要多少钱呢?
in first class style?

718
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,510
我算算
Let me see, yes,

719
00:49:59,547 --> 00:50:03,205
你写一张5000英镑的支票 给Maberley太太
you will send a check for 5,000 pounds to Mrs. Maberley

720
00:50:03,241 --> 00:50:06,078
这是你欠她的
you owe her a little change of that.

721
00:50:06,116 --> 00:50:07,926
再见 Klein夫人
Goodbye, Mrs. Klein.

722
00:50:10,742 --> 00:50:13,337
我毫不怀疑 有一天我会再见到
I have no doubt I shall see you again one day,

723
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:16,407
你在一个国王的怀抱里
on the arm of a king.

724
00:50:19,273 --> 00:50:21,971
于是Klein夫人 著名的美人儿
And therefore the celebrated beauty Mrs. Klein

725
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:24,091
离开前往西班牙
has departed for Spain.

726
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:28,627
她的家族几代都是
Her people have been leaders in Pernambuco

727
00:50:28,664 --> 00:50:30,431
Pernambuco的领袖
for generations.

728
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:34,950
这是一篇有品位的报道
Well, it's a dignified report

729
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,420
不知道其他人会怎么评价它
I wonder what others would have made of it.

730
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:59,104
你让她脱罪了 福尔摩斯
You let her off the hook, Holmes.

731
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,036
你是说她犯了重罪吗?
Compounding a felony, you mean?

732
00:51:02,689 --> 00:51:03,705
谋杀
Murder.

733
00:51:05,299 --> 00:51:07,600
本来就是不可能证实的
It would have been impossible to prove.

734
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:10,722
Klein夫人已经明白了
Mrs. Klein has learned,

735
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,183
一个道理
that you can't play with edged tools forever

736
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:16,908
那就是
without cutting those,

737
00:51:17,862 --> 00:51:20,125
"玩火者必自焚"
aging hands of hers.

738
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:24,980
岁月不饶人
Time is not on her side.

739
00:51:25,017 --> 00:51:27,109
我们走吧
Shall we?

740
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:32,955
