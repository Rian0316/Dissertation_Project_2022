00:00:55,606 --> 00:00:56,720
按我说的去做 小子
Do as I tell you, boy,

00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:58,313
你这该死的不听话的小杂种
you damn, disobedient little bastard.

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,401
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

这是我的生活! 我要按我的方式去过!

早上好!
Morning!

14

钓到什么了吗?
Caught anything?

15
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:28,850
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,340
还没呢
Not yet.

17
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,870
福尔摩斯 你到这儿来干什么?
Holmes, what on earth are you doing here?

18
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,333
来找你
Looking for you.

19
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,819
你继续吧 亲爱的朋友
Well, carry on my dear fellow,

20
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:39,776
别让我打扰了你
don't let me disturb you.

21
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,998
你究竟是来干什么的?
What on earth are you doing here?

22
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,744
来办一个案子
A case has brought me this way.

23
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:55,153
什么样的案子?
What sort of case?

24
00:01:55,266 --> 00:01:56,525
报纸上管它叫做
The newspapers are calling it the

25
00:01:56,562 --> 00:01:57,995
Boscombe溪谷之谜
Boscombe Valley mystery,

26
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,775
我想你读过有关的报道了吧?
I expect you've read something of it?

27
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:00,556
未曾耳闻
Not a word.

28
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,946
我好多天没看报纸了
I haven't seen a paper for days.

29
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:06,700
一位农场主 Cole McCarthy 澳大利亚人
A farmer, Cole McCarthy, Australian by birth

30
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:10,600
死在了他农场尽头的一个湖边
met his death by a mirror at the bottom of his farm.

31
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,441
他们似乎已经认定 这是一起严重的案件
They seem to have established a very serious case

32
00:02:12,478 --> 00:02:14,925
指控凶手就是死者的儿子
against the son of the murdered man.

33
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,994
那块石头下有条大鱼
There's a big one just under that rock.

34
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:26,149
这么说是起谋杀案了?
So then it's a murder?

35
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:28,727
呃 估计是这样
Well, it's projected to be so.

36
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,982
当然在我有机会亲自调查之前
Of course I shall take nothing for granted

37
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:33,814
我是不会想当然的
until I've had a chance to look into it personally.

38
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:35,516
那是自然
Naturally.

39
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,521
我不想毁了你的假期
I don't wish to spoil your holiday

40
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,296
但我在想能不能说服你
but I was wondering if I could persuade you

41
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,831
跟我一起查几天案?
to join me for a couple of days?

42
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:48,019
当然可以
Well of course.

43
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,097
真的吗?
Are you sure?

44
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,799
我的荣幸
I shall be delighted.

45
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,424
那我们必须马上动身
Then we must move quickly,

46
00:02:56,536 --> 00:03:00,355
当地火车35分钟之后出发
our local train leaves in 35 minutes.

47
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,651
您的水 先生
Your water, sir.

48
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:50,837
华生 这些新鲜空气会要了我的命
Watson, all of this fresh air will kill me.

49
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:52,127
嗯
Mmm.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,230
似乎伦敦报业对此事兴趣不浓
Well, the London Press don't seem much interested,

51
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:57,318
没有很完整的报道
not very full accounts.

52
00:03:57,425 --> 00:03:58,778
是的
Yes.

53
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:00,344
毫无用处
Useless.

54
00:04:01,287 --> 00:04:02,730
报纸就看到这儿吧
So much for the London Press.

55
00:04:02,768 --> 00:04:03,876
案子似乎再简单不过了
It all seems depressingly simple,

56
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,147
到底是什么让你对它产生了兴趣?
what persuaded you to take an interest in this case?

57
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:07,614
这个
This.

58
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,401
Boscombe溪谷一案
Boscombe Valley mystery.

59
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,983
审理中存在严重误导
There has been a grave miscarriage of justice.

60
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:14,924
事态紧急
The matter is urgent.

61
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,060
我们需要您的帮助
We need your help.

62
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:19,300
如能驾临 不胜欣幸 Alice Turner
Please come if you can, Alice Turner.

63
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:21,739
老天 谁是Alice Turner?
Good heavens, who is Alice Turner?

64
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:23,043
她是Turner先生的女儿
She is the daughter of Mr. Turner,

65
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,888
也是澳大利亚人 这整片庄园都是她家的
also Australian who owns this whole estate.

66
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:30,606
噢 这对于Turner小姐而言 这只是一个"谜团" 而不是一起谋杀
Oh, well it's a mystery, not murder to Miss Turner.

67
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:33,499
注意这个"我们"  华生 "我们需要您的帮忙"
Note the "we" Watson, we need your help.

68
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,966
如果说这是心底的呼唤
If ever there's a cry from the heart that is

69
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:36,704
那它已经跃然纸上了
that it leaps from the paper.

70
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,087
你见过这位女士了吗?
Have you seen this lady?

71
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,255
还没有
No, not yet.

72
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,361
你还记得一位叫Summerby的警官吗?
Do you remember a certain Sergeant Summerby?

73
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:42,825
Summerby?
Summerby?

74
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:45,675
噢 是的 那起西班牙纸币伪造案
Oh, yes, the case of the counterfeit Spanish dollars.

75
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:47,033
是墨西哥
Mexican.

76
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,476
一个讨人喜欢的家伙 很崇拜你的办案法方 对吧?
A pleasant fellow much admired your methods did he not?

77
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:53,451
也许这就是他升为督察的原因
Probably his reason for promotion to Inspector.

78
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:55,919
他负责这起案子
He is in charge of the case and it was he

79
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:58,788
就是他给我们安排了这个住处
who organized this accommodation for us.

80
00:04:58,825 --> 00:04:59,623
我们?
Us?

81
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:01,509
你断定了我会来?
You presumed that I would come?

82
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:03,185
不 不是"断定" 华生
No, not presumed, Watson,

83
00:05:03,186 --> 00:05:06,411
是"希望"  非常希望
hoped, very much hoped.

84
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,075
福尔摩斯先生
Well, Mr. Holmes

85
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:11,882
还有你 医生
and you, Doctor,

86
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,495
很高兴又再见到你们
it's a pleasure to see you again.

87
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:16,087
对你的升职谨表祝贺 督察
Congratulations on your promotion, Inspector.

88
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:18,074
谢谢 医生
Thank you, Doctor.

89
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,186
这通常是个安静的地区
It's a quiet district as a rule

90
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:23,150
不过依然是我自己的辖区
but nonetheless my own.

91
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:24,174
我叫了一辆马车在等着
I have a carriage waiting.

92
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,277
啊 哦!
Ah, oh.

93
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,771
这个被害的McCarthy
McCarthy, the murdered man

94
00:05:39,808 --> 00:05:42,899
从Turner先生那里 租了一个叫Havely的农场
rented a farm called Havely from a Mr. Turner

95
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:46,117
Turner是当地最大的农场主之一
who is one of the largest London proprietors in this part of the country.

96
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:47,571
他在澳大利亚发的财
He made his money in Australia.

97
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:49,441
我想拥有同样在殖民地的经历
I presume that both being colonials

98
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:51,309
让他们会有很多共同之处
they had much in common.

99
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,329
我想是老朋友吧
Old friends, I believe.

100
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,990
Turner先生已经病了一段时间了
Well, Mr. Turner has been in failing health for some time.

101
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:57,054
他有个叫Alice的女儿?
He has a daughter called Alice?

102
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,698
是他的独女 非常迷人
An only child and a most charming one.

103
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:05,356
我们想Turner小姐 和McCarthy家的儿子是朋友吧?
We surmise that Miss Turner and the McCarthy boy are friends?

104
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:06,798
非常要好的朋友
Great friends.

105
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,759
是Turner小姐请我到这儿来的
It was Miss Turner who brings me here.

106
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:09,793
噢 我知道 福尔摩斯先生
Oh I know, Mr. Holmes,

107
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,722
坦白说吧 您来了我很意外
and to be quite honest with you I'm surprised you came.

108
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:14,432
这个案子其实非常清楚
The case is as plain as a flag staff

109
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,637
我接触得越多 就越觉得案情很明朗
and the more I get into it the plainer than it comes.

110
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:19,728
所以我提醒Turner小姐说
So I have warned Miss Turner that this time

111
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,424
这次就算是歇洛克.福尔摩斯先生
not even Mr. Sherlock Holmes

112
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,559
也不能让奇迹出现
will be able to work miracles.

113
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,259
这里的乡村景色真美
It's a beautiful countryside.

114
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:32,488
是的 的确如此 这是Boscombe溪谷
Yes, yes, indeed this is Boscombe Valley.

115
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:34,786
那边的谷底就是Boscombe湖
And over there at the bottom is Boscombe Mirror

116
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,316
也就是凶案发生的地方
where the murder took place,

117
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,229
一个宁静之地居然发生了如此悲剧
a peaceful place for a tragedy.

118
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,935
有目击者吗?
Any witnesses?

119
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,411
我就等你问这个问题 福尔摩斯先生
I expected that question, Mr. Holmes.

120
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:44,773
主要的目击者是William Crowder
The principle witness is William Crowder,

121
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:47,662
是Turner先生的猎场看守之一
one of Mr. Turner's gamekeepers.

122
00:06:52,332 --> 00:06:54,514
就在我用完晚餐以后
It was after I had me dinner,

123
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,297
上星期一是...
last Monday it was, the...

124
00:06:57,413 --> 00:06:59,144
六月三号
The third of June.

125
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:01,545
噢 噢 没错
Oh, that's right.

126
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:04,017
我现在养小雉鸡
Now I fed the young pheasants,

127
00:07:04,127 --> 00:07:05,930
我们管它们叫小雉
ports we call them.

128
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:07,773
你当时正把生菜移到户外来种
You were planting out lettuces.

129
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,554
噢 是的
Oh, that's right,

130
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,542
我正在移植生菜
I was setting out some lettuces,

131
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,631
就是那边的那些
those lettuces over there.

132
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,269
突然我的小女儿Patience
When my little girl, Patience,

133
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,699
一路跑过来
she comes running up.

134
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:31,856
爸爸 爸爸 McCarthy父子在吵架
Dad, dad, the McCarthy's are fighting.

135
00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:34,214
这不是第一次了
Well it won't be the first time.

136
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,884
别担心 Patience
Well, don't you worry about it, Patience,

137
00:07:37,921 --> 00:07:41,000
那不关我们的事
it ain't no concern of ours.

138
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:42,465
去吧 进去吧
Go on, in you go.

139
00:07:48,837 --> 00:07:51,162
那个McCarthy先生
That, Mr. McCarthy,

140
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:54,676
他的脾气...你知道啦
he has a temper that one, you know.

141
00:07:54,787 --> 00:07:56,352
要是他认为有另一只枪
You know, if he thought another gun

142
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,086
在偷猎他瞄准的鸟
had poached his bird out shooting,

143
00:07:58,123 --> 00:08:00,681
就会乱开一通把鸟吓走
he'd let fly in a real fury.

144
00:08:00,876 --> 00:08:02,305
那小伙子也是这样吗?
Was the boy the same way inclined?

145
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,340
请不用给我倒牛奶
No milk for me, please.

146
00:08:04,861 --> 00:08:06,332
不是的
No.

147
00:08:06,443 --> 00:08:08,352
在我看来他不是这样的人
No, not that I've noticed anyway.

148
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,342
不 他看上去一直是个和气的孩子
No, he always seemed a nice enough boy.

149
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,849
他干了这样的事情让我很意外
I'm surprised him doing such a thing.

150
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,140
不过 话又说回来
But, then again,

151
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,331
他当时被激怒了
he was provoked.

152
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:21,542
毫无疑问 就是这样的
No doubt, who's to say.

153
00:08:21,647 --> 00:08:24,672
你来告诉这两位先生接下来发生的事
You tell the gentlemen what happened next.

154
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:25,608
什么?
What?

155
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,733
你没有忘记你在聆讯作证时所说的话吧?
You haven't forgotten what you said in evidence at the inquest.

156
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,901
忘记?
Forgotten?

157
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,648
只要活着一天 我就不会忘记
I shant forget that day not so long as I live.

158
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:37,231
我把Patience打发回屋里找她的母亲
I just sent Patience into her mother

159
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,293
之后才仅仅移植了另一个苗木箱的生菜
and I hadn't planted out no more than another hour box,

160
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,168
Hugh McCarthy就跑了上来
when Hugh McCarthy come running up

161
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,578
活像见了鬼似的
looking like he'd seen a ghost.

162
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,097
我父亲遇到了一起严重的意外
My father's met with a terrible accident.

163
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:48,726
请跟我来 我需要你帮忙
Please come with me, I need your help.

164
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:49,389
他在哪?
Where is he?

165
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:51,356
在山下的湖边
Down by the Mirror.

166
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,772
他还活着吗?
Is he alive?

167
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,873
你跟我来
You just come along with me.

168
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:54,920
我把他带回到这儿来
I brought him back here

169
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:57,572
然后派我的妻子去找警察
and I sent me wife down to the track for the police.

170
00:09:57,678 --> 00:09:59,136
那个男孩有没有说什么?
Did the boy say anything?

171
00:09:59,244 --> 00:10:01,356
没有 没有 一声不吭
No, no, not a word.

172
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,822
他就坐在你坐的这个位置上
He just sat there where you are,

173
00:10:02,932 --> 00:10:03,999
又哭又呜咽
sobbing and moaning

174
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:05,335
我一直盯着他
and I didn't take me eyes off him

175
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,379
直到他们来抓他  事实就是这样了
until they came for him, that's the truth.

176
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,778
你是不是彻底检查了那把枪
Did you examine the gun at all,

177
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,002
比如说枪托?
the butt for instance?

178
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:13,092
没有
No.

179
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,485
没有 没有专门检查
No, not especially,

180
00:10:15,596 --> 00:10:18,621
枪上面有点泥
there was a bit of mud on it.

181
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:19,972
他擦过枪了
He wiped it.

182
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,040
他擦过枪了
He wiped it.

183
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,854
呃 我可能是擦了枪
Well I might've done.

184
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,625
我是说这很自然 不是吗?
I mean it would've been natural wouldn't it?

185
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,328
McCarthy先生躺在那里 死了
There was Mr. McCarthy lying there dead

186
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,402
脑袋被砸瘪了
with his head bashed in.

187
00:10:30,402 --> 00:10:32,392
驱赶黄蜂也不会搞成那样吧?
He hadn't got that way swatting wasps had he?

188
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,661
而你认为那个小伙子杀了他的父亲?
And you believe that the boy killed his father?

189
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:37,853
呃 我当然是这样想的 先生
Well, of course I do, sir.

190
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:40,851
我是说还能是谁呢?
I mean who else could've done it?

191
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:43,073
我能告诉你们的就这么多 先生们
I can tell you this much, gentlemen.

192
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:45,821
好吧 我是个猎场看守人 我知道
All right, now, I'm a gamekeeper all right

193
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,323
如果谁手里拿着一把枪
and when a man's got a gun in his hand

194
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,922
再不可思议的事情也会发生
strange things can happen.

195
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:50,596
我见过不少人
Oh, now I've seen men,

196
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,889
相当遵纪守法的人
quiet law abiding gentleman,

197
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,067
可要是把枪放到他们手里
you put a gun in their hands

198
00:10:54,068 --> 00:10:55,674
就会变得近乎疯狂
they turn into near maniacs.

199
00:10:55,784 --> 00:10:57,020
非常感谢 Crowder先生
Thank you so much, Mr. Crowder,

200
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,206
占用了你这么宝贵的时间
for giving so much of your valuable time.

201
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:05,975
噢 我很荣幸 先生们
Oh, it's been a pleasure gentlemen.

202
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,165
我不是第一次协助司法调查了
It's not the first time I've been able to help the cause of justice,

203
00:11:08,202 --> 00:11:09,624
不 绝不是
no, not by a long shot.

204
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,468
呃 去年圣烛节的时候
All right, well last year at Candlemas time,

205
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,576
你还记得吧 督察?
you remember Inspector?

206
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:16,355
-不 我说错了 是两年前... -呃 我们得走了
-No, I'm a liar, it were two years ago. -Well, we must be on our way.

207
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,561
我是站在法律和秩序一方的 先生
Well, I'm on the side of law and order, sir,

208
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:19,884
督察会告诉您的
the Inspector will tell you that.

209
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:22,076
你的确是如此 Crowder
Indeed you are, Crowder.

210
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,406
谢谢
Thank you.

211
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:24,930
再见
Goodbye.

212
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:30,890
这些乡下人都一个样
They're all the same these country people.

213
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:32,363
要是有人听他们说
Once they get an audience

214
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,815
就会喋喋不休说个没完
they'll talk the hind leg off a donkey.

215
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:35,201
您要是跟我走的话
Now if you follow me

216
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,586
我会带您到案发现场去
I'll take you down to the scene of the crime.

217
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:38,894
暂时没这个必要
No need for the moment.

218
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,782
那倒是真的 在这种情况下确实没必要
That's very true, no need in the circumstances.

219
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,296
这是件不幸的案子 却很明朗
It's a sad case, but a pretty clear one,

220
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,763
气压很高
the glass is high.

221
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,248
天气晴朗
Weather set fair.

222
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:54,364
我要去探访James McCarthy
I shall like to call on James McCarthy.

223
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,724
要是您想去的话我可以安排
I can arrange it if you wish.

224
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:56,561
明天
Tomorrow.

225
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,439
明天
Tomorrow.

226
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,459
还有一件事我得告诉您 福尔摩斯先生
One more thing I should tell you, Mr. Holmes.

227
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:02,157
那个小伙被控谋杀时
When the boy was charged with the murder,

228
00:12:02,273 --> 00:12:04,634
他一点也不显得惊奇
he didn't appear in the least surprised.

229
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:07,934
事实上 他说这是他应得的
In fact, he said it was no more than his desserts,

230
00:12:08,049 --> 00:12:09,222
这是他的原话
those were his very words.

231
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,510
算是认罪了吗?
A confession?

232
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:11,489
你也可以这样想
You might think so.

233
00:12:11,599 --> 00:12:13,508
那他是不是也宣称了自己的清白?
Did he also protest his innocence?

234
00:12:13,616 --> 00:12:14,932
是的
Yes.

235
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:17,189
不过罪犯总是这样说的 不是吗?
But then again, they always do don't they?

236
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:18,893
我想我们最好还是回旅馆去
I think we best be getting back to the hotel.

237
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,547
我还去庄园做些拜访
I have some calls to make on the estate.

238
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,359
那明天见
Until tomorrow then.

239
00:12:24,472 --> 00:12:26,547
Boscombe Arms旅馆
Boscombe Arms.

240
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,876
那男孩说这是他应得的
The boy said he got no more than his desserts,

241
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:43,931
呃 这样说相当可疑
well that's a pretty suspicious remark.

242
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:47,295
我是说 在发生了这么多事之后
I mean, coming after such a damning series of events.

243
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:49,825
相反地 在目前这恰好是
On the contrary the brightest rips I can see

244
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:51,328
在云层中我能看到的最明亮的一线曙光了
in the clouds at present.

245
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,213
他话中流露出的悔悟
Self-approach contrition displayed by his remark

246
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:55,944
是一种健康心态的象征
appears to be signs of a healthy mind,

247
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:57,778
说明他不心虚
rather than a guilty one.

248
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,073
比这微小得多的证据 都曾把许多人送上了绞架
Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence.

249
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:01,940
确实如此
So they have

250
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,391
许多人被错误地送上了绞架
and many men have been hanged wrongfully.

251
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:06,312
瞧 一只野鸡
Oh, look, a pheasant.

252
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,900
嗯 听这证词
Mm, witness.

253
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,549
James McCarthy说的
That's James McCarthy.

254
00:13:23,656 --> 00:13:25,051
我和我的父亲进行了一次谈话
I had a conversation with my father,

255
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:27,220
言辞渐渐激烈起来
which led to high words,

256
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,485
差点就要吵开了
and almost to blows.

257
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:32,658
因为他的脾气渐渐难以控制
As his temper was becoming ungovernable,

258
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:35,831
我就离开了他 往山上走
I left him and went up the hill.

259
00:13:35,938 --> 00:13:39,616
走出不到一百码
I hadn't gone more than a hundred yards

260
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:42,304
突然听到一声很可怕的呼喊
when I heard a hideous outcry,

261
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,466
使我马上往回赶
which caused me to run back again.

262
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,941
我发现我父亲躺在地上
I found my father

263
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,991
快要断气了
expiring on the ground

264
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:53,645
头部严重受伤
with his head terribly injured.

265
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,554
你回去的时候
Did you see anyone near your father

266
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,017
有没有看到你父亲的周围有什么人?
when you returned?

267
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,621
没有 一个人也没有
No, no one.

268
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:02,440
我不知道他是怎么受的伤
I have no idea how he came by his injuries.

269
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:03,890
他不是一个讨人喜欢的人
He was not a popular man,

270
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,085
但据我所知
but as far as I know

271
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,165
他没有什么健在的敌人
he had no active enemies.

272
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:09,937
对这点我只知道这么多
I know nothing further of the matter.

273
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,208
你父亲咽气之前 有没有跟你说起什么?
Did your father say anything to you before he died?

274
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,887
他咕哝了几句话
He mumbled a few words

275
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,156
但是我能听清的就是他提到了一只老鼠
but all I could catch was some allusion to a rat.

276
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:21,517
安静 肃静
Silence, be quiet.

277
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,099
一只老鼠?
A rat?

278
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:27,803
对此你有什么看法?
And what did you understand by that?

279
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,787
对我而言毫无意义
It conveyed nothing to me.

280
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:31,049
我觉得...
I thought,

281
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:34,454
我觉得他神志不清
well I thought he was delirious.

282
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:36,782
你和你父亲临终前的这次争吵
What was the point upon which you and your father

283
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,363
是关于什么事情的?
had this final quarrel?

284
00:14:45,908 --> 00:14:48,719
我不想回答这个问题 先生
I should prefer not to answer that question, sir.

285
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,420
恐怕我得坚持这个要求
I'm afraid that I must press it.

286
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:52,588
我真的不可能告诉您
It really is impossible for me to tell you

287
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,129
但是我可以向您保证
but I can assure you that it had nothing to do

288
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:57,012
它与此后的悲剧无关
with the sad tragedy that followed.

289
00:14:57,013 --> 00:14:59,829
是否有关要留待法庭来判断
That is for the court to decide.

290
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,159
我必须向你指出
I need hardly point out to you

291
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:02,400
你拒绝回答问题的行为
that your refusal to answer

292
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,977
在未来的可能进行的诉讼中
will prejudice your case considerably

293
00:15:03,977 --> 00:15:05,095
将对你的案子
in any future proceedings,

294
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:06,946
十分不利
which may arise.

295
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:08,354
你可以坐下了
You may sit down.

296
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,580
陪审团的先生们
Gentlemen of the jury,

297
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,012
你们在这里是为了查清
you are here to discover the cause of death

298
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,324
William McCarthy先生的死因
of Mr. William McCarthy

299
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:21,317
然后宣布你们的裁决
and thereafter to deliver your verdict.

300
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,416
你们已经听到这起罪案的相关事实了
You have heard the facts of this crime

301
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:26,576
我相信这些事实让案情相当明朗
and I believe they make the situation very clear.

302
00:15:26,577 --> 00:15:30,230
James McCarthy对他父亲的死的供述
Mr. James McCarthy's account of his father's dying

303
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,623
就算退一步来说也是很奇怪的
is singular to say the least.

304
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:36,010
他拒绝提供他与其父最后对话的细节
His refusal to give any details of their last conversation

305
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:39,254
这对他极为不利
must go very much against him.

306
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:42,748
在我看来  做出故意谋杀的裁决
The verdict of willful murder seems to me to fit

307
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,032
与我们所听到的事实是相符的
the facts we have heard.

308
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:47,996
希望我说得够清楚了
I hope I make myself clear.

309
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,292
那么就是故意谋杀了
So willful murder it was.

310
00:15:53,407 --> 00:15:55,910
难以置信
Monstrous.

311
00:15:56,018 --> 00:15:57,825
呃 这小伙子的确也是自找的
Well the boy did rather ask for it.

312
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,703
我亲爱的华生 你难道没发现
My dear Watson, don't you see that both you and the coroner

313
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:00,718
你和验尸官都没能
have been some pains

314
00:16:00,719 --> 00:16:04,159
指出对这位年轻人最有利的一点吗?
to single out the strongest points in the young man's favor?

315
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,114
你没发现你们都认为他
Don't you see that you're terribly giving credit

316
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:08,209
想象力过于丰富或过度缺乏吗?
for much too much imagination or too little.

317
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:10,418
说太缺乏 是因为他没能编造出一个吵架理由
Too little, if he could not invent a quarrel

318
00:16:10,418 --> 00:16:12,135
来博得陪审团的同情
which would give him the sympathy of the jury.

319
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:15,062
说太丰富 是他居然故意说出
Too much, if he evolved from his own

320
00:16:15,063 --> 00:16:16,714
死亡与一只老鼠有关
inner consciousness anything so outr

321
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,598
这么有悖常理的说辞
as a dying of reference to a rat.

322
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:21,344
这些乡村验尸官总以为
Well, these country coroners do think

323
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:25,018
-自己是什么万能的神明 -那完全是不光彩的
they're little tin pot gods. It's an absolute scandal.

324
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:28,561
不不不
No, no, no.

325
00:16:29,524 --> 00:16:31,305
我处理这个案子必须以这个观点为基础
I shall approach this case from the point of view

326
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:35,408
那就是这位年轻人所说的话是真的
of what this young man says is true.

327
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,687
我们来了一位访客
We have a visitor.

328
00:17:11,054 --> 00:17:13,479
我们年轻的委托人到了
Our young client has arrived.

329
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:27,444
请进
Come in.

330
00:17:29,786 --> 00:17:31,861
您来了我太高兴了 福尔摩斯先生
I'm so glad you've come, Mr. Holmes.

331
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,471
我叫Alice Turner
I'm Alice Turner.

332
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,203
这位是我的朋友和同事 华生医生
And this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

333
00:17:35,318 --> 00:17:38,130
-华生医生 久仰 -Turner小姐
Dr. Watson, of course. Miss Turner.

334
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:39,664
就是您用那么充满趣味的笔触
It is you who have written down

335
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,195
把福尔摩斯先生的一些案子
some of Mr. Holmes' cases

336
00:17:41,302 --> 00:17:42,856
记录了下来
in such an interesting way.

337
00:17:42,972 --> 00:17:44,909
你瞧 我了解您的一切 福尔摩斯先生
You see I know all about you, Mr. Holmes

338
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:46,930
还有您的过人成就
and your wonderful success.

339
00:17:47,043 --> 00:17:49,617
您知道我们此刻是多么需要您吗
If you knew how much we need you now,

340
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,739
不过您对已发生的事有所了解吧?
but do you yet know anything of what happened?

341
00:17:51,844 --> 00:17:54,904
请坐 Turner小姐
Please sit down Miss Turner.

342
00:17:55,012 --> 00:17:57,264
Summerby督察已经告诉过我一些情况
Inspector Summerby has told me something of it.

343
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,871
噢 是的 那位督察
Oh, yes, the Inspector.

344
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,123
他把您的地址给了我
He gave me your address.

345
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:03,564
他是个不错的人 不是吗?
He's quite a kind man, isn't he?

346
00:18:03,675 --> 00:18:05,821
不过他不明白
But he doesn't understand.

347
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:08,890
他又怎么能明白呢? 他是位警察啊
How could he, he's a policeman.

348
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:13,826
福尔摩斯先生 我知道这不是James干的
Mr. Holmes, I know that James didn't do it.

349
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:15,459
我知道的
I know it and

350
00:18:15,459 --> 00:18:18,964
而我也希望您在开始调查的时候 能抱着同样的看法
I want you to start your work knowing it too.

351
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,655
对此您永远也不要怀疑
Never let yourself doubt upon that point.

352
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,878
你认识James McCarthy很久了吗?
Have you known James McCarthy a long time?

353
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:26,460
是的 认识他一辈子了
Yes, all my life.

354
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,106
我们打小就认识
We have known each other since we were children,

355
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:32,866
他心肠很软 连一只苍蝇都不会去伤害
but he's too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.

356
00:18:32,972 --> 00:18:36,409
对于那些真正了解他的人来说 这项指控实在是荒唐
This charge is just absurd to anyone who really knows him.

357
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,615
那我希望我们可以还他清白
Well, I hope that we may clear him.

358
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:41,345
我会尽我所能的
I shall do all I can.

359
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,049
但是从您已经听到的来看
But from what you've heard already,

360
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,862
您不觉得他是无辜的吧?
do you not think he's innocent?

361
00:18:44,974 --> 00:18:49,078
我觉得那是有可能的
I think it is probable.

362
00:18:49,184 --> 00:18:51,924
我知道我的朋友还有所怀疑
I don't know my friend is so convinced.

363
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,594
我想福尔摩斯先生的这个结论
I think that Mr. Holmes is being a little,

364
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,808
下得有点太快了
a little quick in his conclusions.

365
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:59,471
但您是对的
But you are right.

366
00:18:59,588 --> 00:19:00,726
噢 我知道您是对的
Oh, I know that you are right.

367
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,624
James永远不会这么做
James never did it.

368
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:06,469
对于他不愿向验尸官谈起的
This quarrel with his father,

369
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:08,728
他与他父亲之间的争吵
which he would not talk about to the coroner,

370
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,016
你是否有所了解?
do you know anything of it?

371
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,633
我相信那是因为此事涉及到我
I believe it was because I was concerned in it.

372
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,108
哪个方面?
In what way?

373
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:20,037
现在不是遮遮掩掩的时候
It is no time to hide anything now.

374
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:21,187
James和他的父亲
James and his father

375
00:19:21,187 --> 00:19:23,726
因为我有过很多争执
had many disagreements about me.

376
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,535
McCarthy先生很希望
Mr. McCarthy was very anxious

377
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:27,901
我们能够结婚
that there should be a marriage between us,

378
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,267
但是James和我之间的爱
but James and I have always loved each other

379
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,040
一直都是兄妹般的感情
like brother and sister.

380
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:35,206
当然我们近来不常见面
Of course we haven't seen so much of each other lately.

381
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,929
我离家到寄宿学校上学 也有好几年了
I have been away at boarding school for some years

382
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,468
而James一直在利物浦上学
and James has been studying in Liverpool.

383
00:19:40,575 --> 00:19:43,831
他只有22岁而且生活阅历不多
He is only 22 and has seen very little of life

384
00:19:43,832 --> 00:19:49,645
所以 呃 我想 现在他还不想结婚
and well, I suppose he does not  wish to do anything like that just yet.

385
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,227
于是他们就有了争吵
So there were quarrels.

386
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:56,012
而我想这次也是一样
And this, I'm sure, was one of them.

387
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,461
你多大了 Turner小姐?
How old are you, Miss Turner?

388
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:03,949
我18了 就快19岁了
I am 18, quite nearly 19.

389
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,634
就像你所说的
As you say,

390
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,676
这不是遮遮掩掩的时候
this isn't a time to hide anything.

391
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,575
你有没有爱上James McCarthy?
Are you in love with James McCarthy?

392
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:24,828
是的 我爱他 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, I am, Mr. Holmes,

393
00:20:24,936 --> 00:20:29,136
非常爱他
very much in love.

394
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:30,983
再没有其他人...
There is no one else

395
00:20:31,095 --> 00:20:34,214
以后也不会有 即使...
and never will be even if,

396
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,133
那他对你的感情呢?
And he with you?

397
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:38,640
哦 我想也是吧
Oh, I think so.

398
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:41,418
我希望如此
I hope so,

399
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:44,129
但我怎么敢肯定
but how should I know for sure?

400
00:20:44,247 --> 00:20:47,581
我们从未谈起过婚事
We have never discussed marriage.

401
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:51,274
你的父亲赞成这样的联姻吗?
Was your father in favor of such a union?

402
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,066
不 他反对
No, he was adverse to it.

403
00:20:56,182 --> 00:21:00,488
除了McCarthy先生 没人赞成这桩婚事
No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favor of it.

404
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,677
谢谢你对我们如此坦诚
Thank you for being so frank with us.

405
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:07,552
要是我去拜访你父亲的话
If I was to visit your father

406
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:09,051
我能见到他吗?
could I see him, please?

407
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,475
恐怕不行
I'm afraid not.

408
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,530
医生不许他会客
The doctor has forbidden any visitors.

409
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,520
我很抱歉 我们不知道他病得这么厉害
Oh, I'm sorry, we did not know he was so ill.

410
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:17,611
我的父亲身体一直比较虚弱
My father has never been strong

411
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:19,866
不过这件事让他彻底地垮了
but this has broken him completely.

412
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,368
噢 他卧床不起
Oh, he has taken to his bed

413
00:21:21,476 --> 00:21:23,135
Willow 医生说他已经行将就木了
and Dr. Willow says that he's a wreck

414
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,159
精神也垮了
and his nervous system is shattered.

415
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:26,773
我几乎没法离开他
Well I can hardly leave him

416
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,487
要不我就会去火车站接您了
 or I would've been at the railway station to meet you.

417
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,722
呃 您要知道
Well, you see,

418
00:21:30,836 --> 00:21:32,780
从前在澳大利亚认识我父亲的人
Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive

419
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:35,736
就只剩下McCarthy先生了
who had known dad in the old days in Australia.

420
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:36,877
澳大利亚?
Australia?

421
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:40,780
在维多利亚州的矿上 金矿
In Victoria at the mines, the gold mines,

422
00:21:40,781 --> 00:21:43,601
父亲就是在那里发的财
that's where dad made all his money.

423
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:50,144
你帮了我的大忙
You have been of material assistance to me.

424
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,652
您会去探望James?
Will you be able to see James?

425
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,295
明天
Tomorrow.

426
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,113
告诉他我知道他是无辜的
Tell him that I know him to be innocent.

427
00:21:59,227 --> 00:22:00,542
我会的
I will.

428
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:06,694
您能不能把这个给他?
Could you give him this?

429
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:07,879
当然可以
Of course.

430
00:22:07,996 --> 00:22:10,604
您要是有消息会告诉我的 对吧?
And if you have any news you will tell me?

431
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,430
我现在得回家了
I must go home now.

432
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:16,522
我留下家父在家睡觉
I left my father asleep but if he awakes

433
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:20,024
不过要是他醒了而我又不在那儿 他会心烦的
and I'm not there he'll be upset.

434
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,732
再见
Goodbye.

435
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:31,547
再见 上帝保佑您调查顺利
Goodbye and God help you in your undertaking.

436
00:22:56,636 --> 00:22:58,095
早上好 督察
Morning Inspector.

437
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,314
我可以单独见他吗?
May I see him alone, please?

438
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:20,849
可以的 福尔摩斯先生
As you wish, Mr. Holmes.

439
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:22,452
但是记住这个人还在羁押中
But remember this man is on remand

440
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,910
被指控故意谋杀
accused of willful murder

441
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,664
您都知道
and as you well know

442
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:26,210
在这样的环境下这样的一个人
such a man under such circumstances

443
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:30,200
-是不可能说真话的 -噢 谢谢你的忠告
-isn't likely to speak the truth. -Oh, thank you for your good advice.

444
00:23:36,336 --> 00:23:38,033
James McCarthy
James McCarthy,

445
00:23:38,146 --> 00:23:39,569
我是歇洛克.福尔摩斯
my name is Sherlock Holmes.

446
00:23:39,676 --> 00:23:40,849
我是来帮你的
I'm here to help you.

447
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,552
我怎么才知道是不是真的?
How should I know that?

448
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:44,092
你和警方的督察一起来的
You came with the police Inspector,

449
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:45,622
我看见他在外面了
I saw him out there.

450
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:49,835
我是应Turner小姐的要求来的
I'm here at the request of Miss Turner.

451
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:07,504
对不起 福尔摩斯先生
I am sorry, Mr. Holmes.

452
00:24:07,616 --> 00:24:10,950
近来我学会了不要相信任何人
Lately I've learned to trust no one.

453
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,898
恐怕您来迟了
I'm afraid you've come too late.

454
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:14,538
他们已经断定
They've already made up their minds

455
00:24:14,643 --> 00:24:15,817
我是有罪的了
that I am guilty.

456
00:24:15,931 --> 00:24:17,628
我就没有
Well, I have not.

457
00:24:17,741 --> 00:24:18,985
这是死因庭 (由死因裁判官主持 裁决死者的死因)
The Coroner's court.

458
00:24:19,097 --> 00:24:20,829
噢 是的 死因庭的陪审团
Oh yes, and the Coroner's jury,

459
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:23,930
对调查的事实一无所知
innocent to inquire into the facts.

460
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:27,134
他们坐在那里却没有在审案
They do not sit in judgment.

461
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,554
呃 我怎么才能帮上忙?
Well, how can I help you?

462
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:31,627
我要你告诉我准确的事发经过
I'd like you to tell me exactly what happened.

463
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:39,648
让我们在这里坐下来 这样可以小声细谈而不会被偷听
Let's sit down over here where we  can talk quietly and not be overheard.

464
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,183
我该从哪儿说起呢?
Where shall I start?

465
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,819
随便你
You choose.

466
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:52,465
呃 我在利物浦上学大约有三年了
Well, I've been studying in Liverpool for some three years.

467
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:53,767
我父亲非常希望
My father was most anxious

468
00:24:53,767 --> 00:24:57,035
我能得到学术方面的资格
I should have some academic qualifications.

469
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:58,459
就在那一天
It was on that day,

470
00:24:58,459 --> 00:25:01,430
六月三号 我回到了家
June the 3rd that I returned home.

471
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,596
你父亲当时正在等你吗?
Was your father expecting you?

472
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,018
不 不 不完全是
No, no, not exactly.

473
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,932
他知道我可以放几天假
He knew I was due for a few days holiday,

474
00:25:07,043 --> 00:25:08,951
不过不知道确切的日期
but not the exact date.

475
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,450
我们当地的客车把我 从村子带回了农场
Our local carrier took me up to  the farm from the village.

476
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,843
欢迎回家 很高兴见到你回来 James少爷
Welcome home, nice to see you back, Master James.

477
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,894
噢 回来真好 George
Oh, it's nice to be back, George.

478
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:19,283
嗨 Stan Stan?
Hey, Stan, Stan?

479
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:20,676
我父亲在屋里吗?
Is my father in the house?

480
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:23,563
不 不 大概五分钟之前出去了
No, no, went off about five minutes ago,

481
00:25:23,674 --> 00:25:26,177
好像有什么心事
looked as though he had something on his mind.

482
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,086
好的 George
All right, George.

483
00:25:28,197 --> 00:25:30,771
你待会儿要用小马吗?
Will you be wanting pony later?

484
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:33,201
不 不 我明天再骑
No, no, I'll ride tomorrow.

485
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,000
我也许该带上把枪
I might have a gun,

486
00:25:34,112 --> 00:25:35,701
看能不能打上几只兔子
see if I could pull a few rabbits.

487
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:37,205
来了很多狩猎的
Plenty shooting,

488
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,330
把这地方挤满了
place is crawling with them.

489
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:40,824
欢迎回家
Welcome.

490
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:57,943
你好 父亲
Hello, father.

491
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:01,308
James?
James?

492
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,442
你在这儿干嘛?
What are you doing here?

493
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:06,846
我回来过几天 就这样
I'm just here for a few days that's all.

494
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,583
呃 我不想你到这下面来
Well, I don't want you down here

495
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:09,592
所以赶紧上去
so get up out of it,

496
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,584
离得远远的 明白了吧?
keep away from it, do you understand?

497
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,312
好...为什么呢?
Yes, why?

498
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:14,710
关你屁事!
None of your damn business!

499
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,730
按我说的做就好了!
Just do as you're told.

500
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:19,864
James
James.

501
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:27,446
瞧 既然你都来了
Look, now you are here

502
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,215
就去Turner家一趟
get over the Turner's place

503
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:30,653
告诉那女孩你要娶她
and tell that girl you'll marry her.

504
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:31,721
我不干
I'll do no such thing.

505
00:26:31,721 --> 00:26:34,025
-您瞧 父亲 我们以前就谈过这个 -按我说的去做!
-Look, father, we have been  through all this before. -Do as I tell you,

506
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,285
你这该死的不听话的小杂种
you damn, disobedient, little bastard.

507
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,763
把枪给我
Give me the gun.

508
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:44,685
-把枪给我! -这是我的生活!
-Give me the gun! -It's my life and

509
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,590
我要按我的方式去过!
I'm going to run it the way I like.

510
00:26:52,398 --> 00:26:55,660
好吧 该死的东西!
All right, damn you!

511
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:57,326
我要把你赶出家门
I'll throw you out.

512
00:26:57,444 --> 00:26:59,211
我要毁了你
I'll ruin you.

513
00:26:59,323 --> 00:27:01,267
你走着瞧
You'll see.

514
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:03,877
现在给我滚开!
Now get off out of it!

515
00:27:08,856 --> 00:27:10,872
我还没走几步
I had hardly gone any distance at all

516
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:14,690
就听到一声可怕的尖叫
when I heard a terrible scream.

517
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:15,872
我往回跑
I ran back down

518
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:18,693
发现我父亲侧躺着
and found my father lying on his side.

519
00:27:18,807 --> 00:27:20,159
你有没有看见别人?
Did you see anyone else?

520
00:27:20,267 --> 00:27:21,203
没有
No one.

521
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:22,379
到处都没有动静吗?
No movement anywhere?

522
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,712
没有 我光顾着看我的父亲了
No, my attention was entirely on my father.

523
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:27,041
他伤得很厉害
He was terribly wounded.

524
00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,525
你不肯把你和你父亲这次争吵的内容
You would not tell the coroner

525
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:33,136
告诉验尸官
about this quarrel with your father.

526
00:27:33,136 --> 00:27:34,983
这是我的私事
It was something private.

527
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,202
又不关他的事
It was no business of his.

528
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:38,846
不是因为和你父亲的这次冲突
Was it not because this confrontation

529
00:27:38,952 --> 00:27:41,240
会对你不利吗?
with your father might seem to incriminate you?

530
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:46,739
不 不 是因为关系到Alice
No, no, it was because it concerned Alice.

531
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,254
这个不关验尸官或是其他人的事
It was no business of the coroners or anyone else's.

532
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,751
我不想她的名字在法庭上 被人随意谈论
I wasn't going to have her name bandied about in the courtroom.

533
00:27:55,722 --> 00:28:01,392
你知道Alice爱着你吧 James
You do know that Alice loves you, James

534
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:04,131
而且相信你是无辜的
and believes you to be innocent.

535
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,679
是的 我知道
Yes, I know.

536
00:28:06,787 --> 00:28:09,290
在这个可怕的地方
The thought of her love and her faith in me

537
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,065
要不是想起了她对我的爱和信任
has kept me in some sort of sanity

538
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,911
我早就疯掉了
in this horrible place.

539
00:28:14,024 --> 00:28:19,265
然而你却不想依你父亲的心愿去娶她?
And yet you had no wish to marry her as your father so clearly wished?

540
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:22,417
也许你不爱她?
Perhaps you did not share her love?

541
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,068
我爱她
I did.

542
00:28:25,069 --> 00:28:27,731
我真的爱她 福尔摩斯先生
I do, Mr. Holmes,

543
00:28:27,837 --> 00:28:29,498
我爱Alice Turner
I love Alice Turner.

544
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,387
我...我为她着迷
I, I adore her,

545
00:28:31,387 --> 00:28:36,390
我拜倒在她的裙下 但是...
I worship the very ground she treads on, but...

546
00:28:37,172 --> 00:28:40,003
然而?
And yet?

547
00:28:41,504 --> 00:28:46,058
我不能向她求婚 因为...
I could not ask her to marry me because,

548
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:49,343
因为我已经结婚了
because I was married already.

549
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,827
你不觉得最好把事情都告诉我吗?
Don't you think you'd better tell me about it?

550
00:29:01,587 --> 00:29:04,746
我刚到利物浦上学的时候
When I first started studying in Liverpool

551
00:29:04,857 --> 00:29:07,847
我父亲给了我相当一笔零用钱
my father gave me a very generous allowance.

552
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,252
也许太大方了 对我没有好处
Perhaps too generous for my own good.

553
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:12,716
我变得很放荡
I became very wild

554
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:16,408
交上了一伙损友
and fell in with a bad set of people.

555
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:20,297
于是在醉酒后的疯狂状态中
And in a fit of drunken madness

556
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:22,417
我在婚姻注册处
I went through a form of marriage

557
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:26,830
和一个比我大得多的女人登记结了婚
in a register office to a woman much older than I was,

558
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,558
一个酒吧女招待
a barmaid.

559
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:34,151
那时我几乎没怎么跟Alice见面
I hardly ever saw Alice at that time.

560
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:35,645
当然我也不能跟我父亲说
Of course I couldn't tell my father.

561
00:29:35,754 --> 00:29:37,041
他肯定会把我赶出家门
He would certainly have thrown me out

562
00:29:37,042 --> 00:29:38,563
他常这样威胁我
as he'd so often threatened.

563
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,061
是的 我肯定他会这样做的
Yes, I'm sure he would.

564
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,580
你知道
Have you any idea

565
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,878
谁会这么残忍地杀害你的父亲吗?
who would've killed your father so brutally?

566
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,495
不管怎么样 一个也没有
None whatsoever.

567
00:29:49,602 --> 00:29:52,448
你知道我一日又一日地
Do you know I go over the scene

568
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,114
反复在脑海里重现那个场景
day after day after day in my mind.

569
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:02,606
但我和所有其他人一样没有头绪
But, I am as puzzled as everyone else is.

570
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,627
不要放弃希望
Don't give up hope.

571
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,370
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生
Thank you, Mr. Holmes.

572
00:30:07,486 --> 00:30:08,945
福尔摩斯先生?
Oh, oh, Mr. Holmes?

573
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:09,775
怎么了?
Yeah?

574
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:11,759
这与案件没有什么关系
It hardly concerns all this business

575
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,552
但是也许我该告诉你
but perhaps I should tell you.

576
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:17,312
这桩祸事也许也有些好处
Some good has come out of this evil.

577
00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:19,071
因为我被关进了这里
Since I've been in here

578
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,679
我收到了跟我结婚的那女人捎来的消息
I received a message from the woman I married

579
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,084
她在报纸上看到我惹上了大麻烦
who has read in the newspapers that I am in serious trouble

580
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:28,671
而且有可能被绞死
and likely to be hanged.

581
00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:30,511
她写信说她其实已经
She wrote that she had a husband already

582
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:32,081
跟Bermuda造船厂的一个人结了婚
in the Bermuda dockyard.

583
00:30:32,189 --> 00:30:33,504
老天!
Good heavens!

584
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:38,930
所以我们之间已经没有任何法律约束了
So, there is no legal tie between us.

585
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:43,421
要是我以前知道就好了
If only I had known before.

586
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:46,378
你告诉我是对的
You were right to tell me.

587
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,781
可怜的家伙
Poor fellow.

588
00:30:56,892 --> 00:31:00,087
被他父亲如此责备 肯定让他发狂
Must've been maddening to be upbraided by his father

589
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:01,857
责备他不肯做一件
for not doing something

590
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:04,605
其实他是如此渴望去做的事情
he would give his very eyes to do.

591
00:31:04,722 --> 00:31:06,738
要是他是无辜的
If he's innocent,

592
00:31:06,843 --> 00:31:07,638
那是谁干的?
who did it?

593
00:31:07,748 --> 00:31:08,508
没错
Indeed.

594
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,934
呃 也许我可以帮忙
Well perhaps I can help.

595
00:31:10,045 --> 00:31:12,784
你不在的时候我并非完全无所事事
I've not been entirely idle in your absence.

596
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:16,166
审讯中 法医的证词里说到
Now in the surgeon's deposition of the inquest it states

597
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:19,641
左后部第三块顶骨
that the posterior third of the left parietal bone

598
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:21,803
和枕骨的左半边
and the left half of the occipital bone

599
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:24,827
都被钝器击碎了
were shattered by blows from a blunt weapon.

600
00:31:24,937 --> 00:31:28,792
就是这里 在后面
Now that's here now behind

601
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:30,319
但是证据表明
but the evidence states

602
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,970
他们争吵的时候是面对面的
that they were quarreling face to face.

603
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:37,040
这个推理非常精彩 华生
That's a very nice piece of deduction, Watson.

604
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:38,607
谢谢
Thank you.

605
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:40,411
但却没有什么作用
But hardly a valid one.

606
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:42,253
McCarthy在女孩跑开的时候
McCarthy could've easily turned his back

607
00:31:42,253 --> 00:31:44,099
很有可能正好转过身去
the moment the girl had run off.

608
00:31:44,212 --> 00:31:45,913
但我很高兴你开始
But I'm so glad that you're coming around

609
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:48,348
用我和Turner小姐的角度去思考了
to my way of thinking and Miss Turner's.

610
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:49,737
那小伙子是无辜的
The boy is innocent.

611
00:31:49,848 --> 00:31:51,306
福尔摩斯 你是硬把这话往我嘴里塞啊
Now, Holmes you're putting words in my mouth,

612
00:31:51,414 --> 00:31:52,482
我并没有那样说过
I didn't say that.

613
00:31:52,597 --> 00:31:55,621
不过你有那样想过 一点点
But you're thinking it just a little.

614
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:07,345
这双靴子就是主人被杀的时候穿的 先生
These boots were the ones the master  was wearing at the time he was murdered, sir.

615
00:32:07,455 --> 00:32:10,823
那以后我当然是把它们都弄干净了
I've cleaned them off since, of course.

616
00:32:10,934 --> 00:32:14,682
那双...那双是James少爷穿的
Those, those are a pair of Master James's.

617
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:17,367
他上次新买的
He bought them new last (unintelligible).

618
00:32:18,293 --> 00:32:21,571
谢谢 George 我们现在到湖边去
Thank you, George, now let's get onto the Mirror.

619
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:29,576
就是这里 福尔摩斯先生
This is the place, Mr. Holmes.

620
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:32,538
您还可以看到血迹
You can still see traces of the blood.

621
00:32:35,165 --> 00:32:37,016
请你们不要踩进来好吗?
Please, would you keep clear of this area?

622
00:32:45,692 --> 00:32:50,211
你们为什么要到下面来 督察?
Why did you enter the Mirror, Inspector?

623
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:52,534
用耙子找过东西
Fished them out with a rack,

624
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:55,009
我以为里头应该有武器之类的东西 或是其他的线索
thought there might be some  weapon thrown there or some other trace.

625
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:57,666
要是我能在他们之前到达这里就好了
If only I'd been here before they came

626
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:00,961
他们就像一群水牛 把所有的痕迹都搅乱了
like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it.

627
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:04,684
应该是猎场看守人和他那一伙人
This must be the gamekeeper and his gang.

628
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:07,918
这些足迹是小McCarthy的
These tracks are young McCarthy's

629
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,522
还有这些
And these.

630
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:13,209
他走了两次
Twice he walked.

631
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,627
他转了回来
He turned.

632
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,202
有一次他是跑来的
Once he ran

633
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:27,996
所以鞋印更深些
so the soles of the feet are deeply marked,

634
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:29,941
而脚后跟的印痕却几乎看不见
the heels are hardly visible.

635
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:31,924
这个证实了他的说法
That would bear out his story he ran

636
00:33:32,037 --> 00:33:34,361
他看见他的父亲躺在地上就跑了过来
when he saw his father on the ground.

637
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:37,807
这个我也说过
(unintelligible).

638
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:41,500
他父亲就在这里来回踱步
The father paced up and down right here.

639
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:46,353
我们在这里找到了什么?
What have we here?

640
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:48,898
脚尖印
Tiptoes.

641
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:53,113
脚尖印
Tiptoes.

642
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:57,834
方头的鞋印 很不寻常的靴子
Square toes most unusual boots.

643
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,447
这位"方鞋头先生"从哪里来的呢?
Where did mister square toes come from?

644
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,696
福尔摩斯可以成为一种罕见的大型警犬
He'd a made a rare bloodhound Mr. Holmes.

645
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,920
这是个相当有趣的案子
It has been a case of considerable interest.

646
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:30,673
来吧
Come.

647
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:37,670
谢谢 George
Thank you, George.

648
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,520
谢谢 先生
Thank you, sir.

649
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,071
能不能帮我送一下这张条子?
Would you deliver this note?

650
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:45,193
好的 先生 没问题
Yes, sir, indeed.

651
00:34:45,194 --> 00:34:46,644
马上去
Right away.

652
00:35:00,582 --> 00:35:02,728
这会让你感兴趣的 督察
This may interest you Inspector.

653
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,269
这就是谋杀的凶器
The murder was done with it.

654
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:11,914
我看不到任何痕迹
I can see no marks.

655
00:35:12,029 --> 00:35:13,381
没有痕迹
There are none.

656
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,497
那你又是怎么知道的?
Well, how do you know then?

657
00:35:14,604 --> 00:35:16,620
草长在它的底下
The grass was growing under it.

658
00:35:16,726 --> 00:35:18,078
说明它几天前还不在那儿
It had only been there a few days.

659
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:20,132
这与伤口相吻合
It corresponds with the injuries.

660
00:35:20,241 --> 00:35:22,008
那凶手呢?
And the murderer?

661
00:35:22,118 --> 00:35:23,849
他是一个高个子 左撇子
He's a tall man, left handed,

662
00:35:23,964 --> 00:35:25,457
右腿有些瘸
limps with the right leg,

663
00:35:25,564 --> 00:35:28,684
穿着厚底方头的狩猎靴
wears thick-soled shooting boots with square toes,

664
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:32,310
抽印度雪茄 用的是雪茄烟嘴
smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar holder

665
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:35,929
口袋里还有一把用钝了的削笔刀
and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket.

666
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,246
您真是了不起 福尔摩斯先生
You're a brilliant man, Mr. Holmes,

667
00:35:44,353 --> 00:35:46,570
我真希望我有您这样的脑子
and I wish I had your brains.

668
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,936
您的理论非常好
Your theories are all very well

669
00:35:49,049 --> 00:35:50,507
不过我还是不能相信
but I'm still not convinced.

670
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:52,073
这次不
Not this time.

671
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,442
我们要对付一个顽固的英国陪审团
We have to deal with a hardheaded British jury.

672
00:35:55,556 --> 00:35:58,711
呃 你已经得到机会了 督察
Well, you've had your chance, Inspector.

673
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:01,008
我是一个实际的人 福尔摩斯先生
I'm a practical man, Mr. Holmes,

674
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:02,853
我无法在这乡村里转悠
I cannot undertake to go around the country

675
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:05,078
寻找一个左撇子男人
looking for a left-handed gentleman

676
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:06,995
还是瘸腿的
with the gamey leg,

677
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:09,988
我会成为Cheshire郡的笑柄
unless I become the laughing stock of Cheshire.

678
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:12,150
我们会知道的
We shall see.

679
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:14,059
你用你的方法
You work your method,

680
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,009
我用我的
I shall work mine.

681
00:36:20,816 --> 00:36:25,122
现在让我们来研究一下早晨的工作
Now, let us take this morning's work.

682
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:27,143
我对地面的检查
From my examination of the ground

683
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,462
让我获得了
I gained details

684
00:36:28,575 --> 00:36:30,128
关于罪犯特征的一些细节
as to the personality of the criminal.

685
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:30,895
唔 哈
Uh-huh.

686
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,946
但是你是怎么知道的?
But how?

687
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:33,607
你了解我的方法
You know my method.

688
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,677
它以对不起眼的事物的观察为基础
It's founded on the observance of trifles.

689
00:36:36,785 --> 00:36:38,624
呃 我知道你从他的步幅长度
Well, his height I know you might roughly judge

690
00:36:38,735 --> 00:36:40,394
能大概估算他的身高
by the length of his stride,

691
00:36:40,508 --> 00:36:42,903
从他的足迹判断出他的靴子 可这个人是没有名字的
his boots by his traces but the man's nameless.

692
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:46,384
他右脚的足迹 总是比左脚的清楚
The impression of his right foot was always left distinct than that of the left.

693
00:36:46,494 --> 00:36:47,581
为什么? 因为他是跛足的
Why? Because he limped.

694
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:49,647
他是个左撇子
He's left-handed,

695
00:36:49,764 --> 00:36:51,637
因为这一击来自死者的正后方
the blow was delivered from immediately behind him

696
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:52,851
而他是靠着左边站着的
yet he was on the left-hand side.

697
00:36:52,966 --> 00:36:53,689
华生
Watson.

698
00:36:53,801 --> 00:36:56,397
他肯定是个左撇子 当然了
He must've been a left-handed man, of course.

699
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:57,652
在父子俩吵架的时候
He stood behind that tree

700
00:36:57,767 --> 00:37:02,000
他就站在那棵树后面
during the confrontation between father and son.

701
00:37:02,116 --> 00:37:03,289
他甚至还抽了烟
He even smoked.

702
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,550
抽烟?
Smoked?

703
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:06,910
雪茄烟灰
Cigar ash.

704
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,808
一种印度雪茄
An Indian cigar.

705
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:13,030
你记得我的专著吧
You will remember my little monograph

706
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:15,291
关于各色烟灰
on the subject of ashes from pipe,

707
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:18,004
雪茄 香烟和烟草 
cigar and cigarette tobacco.

708
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:21,109
要是我没记错的话 有一百种不同的类型
One hundred different varieties if I remember.

709
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,435
一百四十种 谢谢 华生
One hundred and forty, thank you, Watson.

710
00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:26,145
发现了烟灰之后
Having discovered the ash,

711
00:37:26,262 --> 00:37:29,322
我又发现了烟头
I discovered this stump

712
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:32,763
那人把它扔在了苔藓之中
which the man had thrown among the moss.

713
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:37,001
在鹿特丹卷制的一种印度雪茄
An Indian cigar rolled in Rotterdam.

714
00:37:37,117 --> 00:37:38,054
你会注意到
You'll notice

715
00:37:38,162 --> 00:37:40,035
烟头没有被他放进过嘴里
that the end has not been in his mouth

716
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,470
所以他使用的是雪茄烟嘴
so he used a cigar holder.

717
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:46,958
末端是切掉的而不是咬掉的
The tip has been cut off, not bitten,

718
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:48,278
但切口不是很平整
but the cut is not a clean one,

719
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,336
所以我推测他有一把钝的小刀
so I deduced a blunt penknife.

720
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:55,623
你真了不起
You're amazing.

721
00:37:56,638 --> 00:38:00,421
这个垂死的人所咕哝的话中
Among the words mumbled by the dying man.

722
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:02,787
小McCarthy能够听清的唯一字眼
The only word that young McCarthy could understand

723
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:07,207
就是"老鼠"
was the word rat.

724
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,907
老鼠 嗯
Rat, hmm.

725
00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:13,959
非常古怪
Most curious.

726
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:18,306
跟我来
Come with me.

727
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:31,113
现在
Now.

728
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:34,526
你怎么读这个词?
What do you read?

729
00:38:34,631 --> 00:38:35,461
一只老鼠 (发音为:啊拉特)
A rat.

730
00:38:35,571 --> 00:38:36,472
现在呢?
And now?

731
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:39,605
巴勒-拉特  巴勒拉特
Balla-rat, Ballarat.

732
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:41,372
这就是死者所说的那个词
That is the word the man uttered.

733
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,015
澳大利亚
Australia.

734
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:45,173
来自巴勒拉特的某个人 巴勒拉特因何出名?
Someone from Ballarat, what is Ballarat known for?

735
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,144
金矿
Goldfield.

736
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:48,400
Turner小姐说她父亲在金矿区
Miss Turner said that her father had met McCarthy

737
00:38:48,514 --> 00:38:49,688
结识了McCarthy
on the Goldfield.

738
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,569
凭着这些信息我知道方向之所在了
I see the direction, which all this points.

739
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:52,854
一个来自巴勒拉特的澳大利亚人
An Australian from Ballarat

740
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:57,096
一个住在这个地区的人
and one who is at home in the district.

741
00:38:57,213 --> 00:39:01,140
要是我没有搞错的话 他来了
Unless I'm very much mistaken, he's here.

742
00:39:02,397 --> 00:39:04,405
John Turner先生来了
Mr. John Turner.

743
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:15,579
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes.

744
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,977
华生医生
Dr. Watson.

745
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,201
我女儿说你们住在这里
My daughter told me you were lodging here.

746
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:21,384
你收到我的便条了?
Did you get my note?

747
00:39:21,499 --> 00:39:23,574
是的 是的
Yes, yes,

748
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,122
内容是到这里来以避免一起丑闻
something about coming here to avoid a scandal.

749
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:28,592
总好过在你府上见面
Better than meeting up at the hall,

750
00:39:28,701 --> 00:39:31,097
人们会议论纷纷的
people might talk.

751
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:33,601
你干嘛想见我?
Why do you wish to see me?

752
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:46,854
噢 是的
Oh, yes.

753
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:52,115
我知道了所有你和McCarthy之间的事情
I know all about you and McCarthy.

754
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:56,006
我的朋友华生会记下一些事实
My friend Watson will jot down a few facts.

755
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,707
我保证除非很有必要
I promise it will not be used

756
00:39:57,823 --> 00:40:01,927
否则我不会利用它们
unless it is absolutely needed.

757
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,729
请坐下
Do sit down.

758
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,199
你不了解那个死鬼McCarthy
You didn't know the dead man McCarthy.

759
00:40:17,307 --> 00:40:20,890
他是魔鬼的化身
He was a devil incarnate.

760
00:40:20,996 --> 00:40:22,620
是上帝保佑 你们才没有落入
God keep you out of the clutches

761
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:24,289
一个像他这样的人的魔爪之中
of a man such as he.

762
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:26,908
我被他玩弄于鼓掌已经很多年了
His grip has been upon me these many years

763
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:30,525
他毁掉了我的生活
and he's blasted my life.

764
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:36,470
我要先告诉你 我是怎么被他控制的
I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.

765
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:40,094
那是60年代 在矿区
It was in the early 60's at the diggings.

766
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:42,075
那时我还是一个小伙子
I was a young chap then,

767
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:44,438
热血沸腾 莽莽撞撞
hot blooded and reckless.

768
00:40:44,551 --> 00:40:47,647
呃 我没什么运气
Well, I had no luck with me claim,

769
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:49,733
于是就上了梁山
took to the bush and came what you'd call

770
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,438
成了你们所说的路匪
a highway robber.

771
00:40:52,554 --> 00:40:54,143
我们有一小伙人
There was a little gang of us

772
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:56,796
过着一种疯狂自由的生活
who lived a wild free life of it.

773
00:40:56,902 --> 00:40:59,476
不时抢劫一个车站
Sticking up a station from time to time

774
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,642
或是在路上打劫从矿区来的货车
or stopping the wagon on the road from the diggings.

775
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:06,675
他们管我叫"巴勒拉特的黑杰克"
They called me Black Jack of Ballarat.

776
00:41:06,784 --> 00:41:09,595
我想那里的人至今还记得
I believe they still remember the Ballarat gang

777
00:41:09,707 --> 00:41:12,697
"巴勒拉特帮"
in the colony.

778
00:41:33,263 --> 00:41:35,171
货车司机就是McCarthy
The wagon driver was McCarthy

779
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,739
而我饶了他一命
and I spared him.

780
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:38,090
滚!
Get out of it!

781
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,733
继续 跑啊!
Go on, shift!

782
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:41,746
别烦着我 快点!
Do a (unintelligible), fast!

783
00:42:04,194 --> 00:42:05,996
我们拿着金子跑了
We got away with the gold.

784
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:09,894
Mac和我都成了有钱人
And Mac and I were wealthy men

785
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:13,230
爬到了梦想的巅峰
beyond the dreams of Everest.

786
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:14,874
我们...
There was...

787
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,958
我们...
There was...

788
00:42:26,532 --> 00:42:28,714
我们成了悬赏通缉的对象
There was a price on our heads.

789
00:42:30,636 --> 00:42:34,182
我决定到英格兰来
I decided to make for England.

790
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,199
我决心安定下来
I determined to settle down

791
00:42:36,309 --> 00:42:40,198
过一种平静而受人尊重的生活
to a quiet and respectable life.

792
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,131
我买下了这处庄园
I bought this estate 

793
00:42:41,131 --> 00:42:44,682
包括这整个村子 甚至这个旅馆
that included the whole village even this inn is mine.

794
00:42:44,797 --> 00:42:47,158
我开始用我的钱做一些好事
I set myself to do a little good with my money

795
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:51,266
对我所作所为做出弥补
to make up for the way in which I'd earned it.

796
00:42:51,374 --> 00:42:56,000
我结了婚而我的妻子年纪轻轻就去世了
I married and then my darling wife died young.

797
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:59,166
她给我留下了亲爱的小Alice
She left me my dear little Alice.

798
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:04,141
你可以说我是个幸福的人
I was a happy man you might say,

799
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:08,802
直到McCarthy控制了我
until McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

800
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,891
他一路跟踪我
He followed my trail,

801
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:12,906
他刚到这儿来的时候
when he first came here,

802
00:43:13,016 --> 00:43:16,835
还光着脚丫 衣不遮体
he'd hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

803
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:19,235
"我们来了 杰克" 他说
"Here we are, Jack," he said,

804
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,531
"你可以收留我们"
You can have the keeping of us,

805
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:24,182
"我和我的小男孩"
me and my little boy,

806
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,021
"要是你不愿意..."
and if you don't,

807
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:29,394
"英格兰可是个法制国家"
England is a fine law-abiding country

808
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:33,671
"警察总是随便就能找到一个"
and there's always a policeman handy.

809
00:43:33,787 --> 00:43:36,219
我就只好束手待毙 被他敲诈
I was a sitting duck for blackmail.

810
00:43:36,328 --> 00:43:38,095
根本摆脱不了他
There was no shaking him off,

811
00:43:38,205 --> 00:43:39,272
没完没了
there was no rest,

812
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:39,990
不得安宁
no peace,

813
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,991
不能忘却
no forgetfulness.

814
00:43:40,992 --> 00:43:41,994
无论我去到哪里
Turn there I would,

815
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,072
都能看到他那张狡猾狞笑的脸
there was his cunning, grinning face at me elbow.

816
00:43:45,073 --> 00:43:46,998
他一定要得到他想得到的东西
Whatever he wanted he must have

817
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,048
而不管他要什么
and whatever it was

818
00:43:48,049 --> 00:43:50,017
我都得无条件地给他
I gave him without question.

819
00:43:50,018 --> 00:43:55,359
土地 金钱 房子
Land, money, houses

820
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,970
直到最后他又提出了一个我不能满足的要求
until at last he asked the thing I could not give.

821
00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:03,672
他想要Alice
He asked for Alice.

822
00:44:03,779 --> 00:44:06,804
他的儿子和我的女儿一起长大
His son and my girl had grown up.

823
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,785
他知道我身体不佳
He knew I was in weak health.

824
00:44:08,894 --> 00:44:11,290
对他来说要是他儿子能接管所有财产
It seemed a fine stroke to him that his son

825
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,459
那可是再好不过
should step into the whole property.

826
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:17,375
我坚决反对
There I was firm.

827
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:19,539
我不会让他那该死的血统
I would not have his cursed stock

828
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:20,749
来玷污我们家的血脉
mixed with mine.

829
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,365
倒不是我不喜欢那孩子
Not that I had any dislike for the lad,

830
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:25,311
可是他身上流着他父亲的血
but his father's blood was in him

831
00:44:25,421 --> 00:44:27,923
这就够了
and that was enough.

832
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,584
我立场坚定
I stood firm.

833
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:31,397
McCarthy威胁我
McCarthy threatened,

834
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:34,140
我说他用最毒辣的手段也吓不倒我
I braved him to do his worst.

835
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:36,752
我们约好在两家之间的湖边见面
We arranged to meet at the Mirror,

836
00:44:36,868 --> 00:44:40,451
把事情说清楚
halfway between our two houses to talk it over.

837
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,500
按我说的去做
- Do as you're told.

838
00:44:42,609 --> 00:44:43,782
James
James.

839
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:45,316
我听着他的话
As I listened to his talk all that was

840
00:44:45,317 --> 00:44:48,292
心里所有的愤恨越来越强烈
black and bitter seemed to come upper most

841
00:44:48,293 --> 00:44:50,495
他催促他儿子娶我的女儿
and he was urging his son to marry my daughter

842
00:44:50,495 --> 00:44:52,894
丝毫没有顾及她的感受
with as little regard for what she might think

843
00:44:52,895 --> 00:44:54,712
活活把她当成了街上卖身的妓女
as a slut from off the streets.

844
00:44:54,713 --> 00:44:57,582
-我们以前就谈过这个 -按我说的去做 小子!
-We have been through all this before. -Do as I tell you, boy,

845
00:44:57,582 --> 00:44:59,575
你这该死的不听话的小杂种!
you damn disobedient little bastard.

846
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:01,166
一想到我和我心爱的一切
It drove me mad to think that I

847
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,666
将落入这个人的魔爪
and all that I held dear

848
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,784
我都快疯了
should be in the power of such a man.

849
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,933
-这是我的生活! -我要按我的方式去过!
It's my life and I'm going to run it the way I like.

850
00:45:07,933 --> 00:45:10,637
我快死了 也没什么指望了
I was a dying and desperate man.

851
00:45:10,637 --> 00:45:12,934
如果我能让这张邪恶的嘴巴永远闭上
If I could silence that foul tongue I could still

852
00:45:12,935 --> 00:45:16,077
那我还能挽救我 和我的家庭在这个溪谷里的名声
save me and my family's reputation in this valley.

853
00:45:16,185 --> 00:45:18,166
给我滚开
Get off out of it.

854
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:01,129
是我干的  福尔摩斯先生
I did it, Mr. Holmes,

855
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:04,018
再来一次 我还会这么干
and I would do it again.

856
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:05,659
虽然我罪孽深重
Deeply though I've sinned

857
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:09,999
但我也过了一辈子痛苦的日子做出了补偿
I've lived a life of martyrdom to atone for it.

858
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:11,926
如果让我的女儿
If my girl should become entangled

859
00:46:11,926 --> 00:46:13,691
也经受我曾受过的痛苦
in the same meshes which held me

860
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:16,756
那我是绝对不答应的
was more than I could suffer.

861
00:46:16,865 --> 00:46:19,189
我把他打倒了 心里一点也不后悔
I struck him down with no more compunction

862
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:23,926
他就是一只凶猛恶毒的野兽
than if he'd been some foul and venomous beast.

863
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,931
这就是事情的经过 先生们
That is the true story gentlemen

864
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,973
千真万确
of all that occurred.

865
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:45,288
对你的判决不是由我来做
It is not for me to judge you,

866
00:46:45,395 --> 00:46:49,374
但是我希望 我们永远也不用经受这样的诱惑
but I hope that we may never expose to such temptation.

867
00:46:50,581 --> 00:46:52,793
我也希望不用 先生
I pray not, sir.

868
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:55,717
我是个快要死的人了
I'm a dying man.

869
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:01,185
我患糖尿病很多年了
I've had the diabetes for years.

870
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,298
我的医生说 我是否能活上一个月都成问题
My doctor says it's a question  of whether I shall live a month

871
00:47:06,411 --> 00:47:08,508
而我想要死在自己家里
and I'd rather die under me own roof

872
00:47:08,508 --> 00:47:09,969
而不是在监狱中
than in a jail.

873
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:11,838
不会的 不过McCarthy必须获释
No, McCarthy must be got off, however.

874
00:47:12,605 --> 00:47:13,434
老天助我
God help me but

875
00:47:13,434 --> 00:47:17,357
不过我也不想那男孩受到伤害
I wouldn't let that young man come to harm.

876
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,328
我向你保证
I'll give you my word that I'd have spoken out

877
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:21,788
如果审判对他不利 我会说出真相的
if it went against him at the assizes.

878
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:23,864
很高兴听到你这样说
I'm very glad to hear you say so.

879
00:47:23,864 --> 00:47:25,306
要不是为了我亲爱的女儿
I'd have spoken now

880
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:28,949
我现在就会把真相公诸于众
if it had not been for my dear girl.

881
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:32,010
这样会让她心碎的
It would break her heart.

882
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,346
她要是听到我被捕了 她会心碎的
It'll break her heart when she hears that I'm arrested.

883
00:47:38,347 --> 00:47:40,573
不会到那个地步
It may not come to that.

884
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:45,593
我们不是警察
We're not the police.

885
00:47:46,527 --> 00:47:49,653
我也不是政府的什么密探
I am no official agent.

886
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:53,396
我是应你女儿的要求来的
I'm here at your daughter's request.

887
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:57,956
-Alice? -是Alice
-Alice? -Alice.

888
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,410
那你打算怎么做?
Then what do you intend to do?

889
00:48:04,517 --> 00:48:07,612
考虑到你的健康 我什么也不打算做
In view of your health, nothing.

890
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,256
你自己都意识到 你将去到更高的一级法庭(天庭)
You are yourself aware that you'll have to answer

891
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,915
来为你所做的事情承担后果
for your deed at a higher court than the assizes.

892
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,684
如果小McCarthy被宣告有罪
If young McCarthy's condemned

893
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,909
我将不得不公开你的供词
I shall be forced to use this confession.

894
00:48:19,025 --> 00:48:23,349
要是他被判无罪 那这份供词就永远不会被人看到
If not, it will never be seen by mortal eye

895
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:27,469
而不管你是否在世 你的秘密都将是安全的
and your secret whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe.

896
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:51,552
那么再见吧
Farewell then.

897
00:48:56,464 --> 00:49:00,038
在你自己要离开人世的时候
Your own deathbeds when they come

898
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:03,938
当你一想到你曾给我带来的安宁
a little bit easier for a  thought of the peace

899
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:07,410
你会死得更心安的
 that you've given to mine.

900
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,149
噢 上帝啊 帮帮我们吧
Oh God, help us.

901
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:45,515
Turner John Stewart 于8月16日
Turner, John Stewart, 16th of August,

902
00:49:45,626 --> 00:49:47,737
在Cheshire郡的Boscombe宅邸Cheshire
Boscombe Hall Cheshire.

903
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,169
在长期与病魔斗争后
After a long illness,

904
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,349
与世长辞 Alice敬爱的父亲
bravely born, beloved father of Alice.

905
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:58,390
我们可以在小McCarthy的审讯中
Well, we're free to use that confession

906
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,223
随意地使用那份供词了
at young McCarthy's trial.

907
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:02,424
不 绝对不要
No, by no means.

908
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:05,058
我的承诺是除非McCarthy被判有罪
My promise was it would not be used

909
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:06,441
否则我们将不会使用它
unless McCarthy is condemned

910
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:08,467
而我想我已经给出了足够的反驳理由
and I think I've given enough objections

911
00:50:08,468 --> 00:50:10,760
足以确保他无罪释放
to the charge to insure his acquittal.

912
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:12,755
希望如此
Well, I hope so.

913
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:31,353
我爱你
I love you.

914
