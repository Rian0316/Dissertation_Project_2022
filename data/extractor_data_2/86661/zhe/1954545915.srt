我必须要去一趟
I shall have to go.

8
00:02:31,837 --> 00:02:33,686
去一趟 去哪?
Go?

9
00:02:33,356 --> 00:02:35,219
Go where?

King's Pyland
King's Pyland.

11
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:42,350
昨天晚上Devonshire警局的Gregory督察
Last evening Inspector Gregory

12
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:43,985
逮捕了知名的赛马人
of the Devonshire Constabulary

13
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:45,900
Fitzroy Simpson
arrested well known racing personality

14
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:49,480
并且控诉他谋杀了驯马师John Straker
Fitzroy Simpson

15
00:02:45,968 --> 00:02:47,402
and charged him with the murder

16
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,164
of trainer, John Straker.

17
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,584
哦 请进
Oh, come in.

18
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,878
又有两封电报 福尔摩斯先生
Two more telegrams, Mr. Holmes.

19
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,436
谢谢你 Hudson女士
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

20
00:02:57,515 --> 00:03:00,094
你这两天一直在不停地问它们
You've been bombarded with these

21
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,252
又是Gregory督察发来的
the last couple of days.

22
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:03,252
Another one from Inspector Gregory.

23
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:04,845
和一封Ross上校的
A note from Colonel Ross.

24
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:06,288
哇 那是马的主人
Awe, that's the horse's owner.

25
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,157
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you my dear.

26
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:11,363
华生
Watson,

27
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:14,037
我犯了一个大错
I had made a blunder,

28
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:17,825
是那些只读了你的传记而知道我的人
which I am afraid is a more common occurrence

29
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:17,667
than anyone would think

30
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:20,370
不会想到的一件常事
who only knew me through your memoirs.

31
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,097
不过事实是我不敢相信
But the fact is that I could not believe

32
00:03:22,175 --> 00:03:23,869
像银额马这样一匹一眼就能认出的马
that so a remarkable a horse as Silver Blaze

33
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,501
会就这么消失...
could disappear,

34
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,337
特别是在像Dartmoor这样的僻静之地
especially in the seclusion of

35
00:03:26,982 --> 00:03:28,744
somewhere like Dartmoor.

36
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,750
我无时无刻都希望可以听到消息
From hour to hour I expect to hear

37
00:03:30,818 --> 00:03:33,556
那个拐马者就是杀害John Straker的凶手
that the abductor was the murderer of John Straker

38
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:34,515
而且马也找回来了
and the horse had been found

39
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,319
但是看上去不是这么回事
but that doesn't seem to be the case.

40
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:39,258
我会很乐意跟你一起去
I should be happy to go with you.

41
00:03:39,328 --> 00:03:41,387
不 在Tavistock呢
No, Tavistock.

42
00:03:41,463 --> 00:03:44,900
如果我不妨碍你的话
If I should not be in the way.

43
00:03:44,967 --> 00:03:48,094
哦 我亲爱的华生
Oh my dear Watson,

44
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,765
你愿意同去是对我很大的支持
you would confer a great favor upon me by coming.

45
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:53,638
我相信不会浪费你的时间
I'm sure your time will not be misspent.

46
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,612
我保证这绝对是件独一无二的案子
The case promises to be absolutely unique.

47
00:03:57,681 --> 00:03:59,443
我们正好能赶上去Paddington的火车
We can just catch our train from Paddington.

48
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:04,655
哦 华生 你可以带上你的双筒望远镜吗
Oh Watson, would you be so kind

49
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:03,642
as to bring your field glasses?

50
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,792
Hudson女士 我们要去Dartmoor
Mrs. Hudson, were off to Dartmoor.

51
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:45,857
请出示车票
Tickets please.

52
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,457
谢谢你 巡票员
Thank you, Inspector.

53
00:04:47,536 --> 00:04:49,366
谢谢
Thank you.

54
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:02,448
华生 我们今天的速度不错
Watson, were going well.

55
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,113
现在的速度是...
Our speed at present

56
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,522
每小时五十三英里半
is fifty-three and half miles an hour.

57
00:05:09,593 --> 00:05:12,687
我没留心去数每隔四分之一英里的路杆
I've not observed the quarter mile post.

58
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:14,958
我也没有
Nor have, I

59
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,446
但是这条铁路边的电线杆的间隔
but the telegraphed posts

60
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,358
...是六十码
on this line are sixty yards apart.

61
00:05:20,706 --> 00:05:23,173
这是很简单的计算
The calculation is a simple one.

62
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,377
那份受人瞩目 喜欢过度渲染的体育报纸
Has that remarkably, colored, sporting paper

63
00:05:32,452 --> 00:05:34,511
提到了任何关于我们的马的事吗
anything to say on the subject of our horse?

64
00:05:34,587 --> 00:05:35,713
什么?
What?

65
00:05:35,788 --> 00:05:38,723
哦 有的
Oh, Yes.

66
00:05:38,791 --> 00:05:40,589
好
Yes.

67
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:46,392
在这里
Here we are.

68
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:48,457
银额马
Silver Blaze.

69
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:51,733
银额马拥有Isonomy的血统
Silver Blaze is from Isonomy stock.

70
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:53,171
Isonomy
Isonomy.

71
00:05:53,242 --> 00:05:56,781
而且像它著名的祖先一样 保持着辉煌的记录
And holds as brilliant a record

72
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:57,075
as his famous ancestor.

73
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:59,239
它现在五岁了
He's now in his fifth year

74
00:05:59,314 --> 00:06:02,520
每次都能在赛马场上
and has brought in turn

75
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:02,583
each of the prize of the turf

76
00:06:02,557 --> 00:06:05,606
为他幸运的主人Ross上校赢得奖金
to Colonel Ross his fortunate owner.

77
00:06:06,121 --> 00:06:08,817
眼下灾难发生之际
At the time of the catastrophe

78
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:11,485
它是Wessex杯中最有望夺冠的一匹
he was first favored for the Wessex Cup.

79
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:15,087
赔率是二比一
The odds quoted being two to one against.

80
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:18,539
作为赛马嗜好者一向最爱的宠驹
He's always been a prime favorite

81
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:21,484
从来没有让他们失望过
of the racing public

82
00:06:18,802 --> 00:06:22,101
and has never yet disappointed them.

83
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,037
尽管赌注悬殊
In spite of the unfavorable prize,

84
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:26,508
还是有巨款押在了它身上
a great deal of money has been placed upon him,

85
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:28,057
所以很明显
so it is obvious, therefore,

86
00:06:28,094 --> 00:06:31,669
许多人出于自身利益的考量
that there are many people

87
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,572
with the strongest interest

88
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:37,086
会想方设法阻止银额马出赛
in preventing Silver Blaze

89
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:37,088
from being there at the fall of the flag.

90
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:50,581
好吧 Baynes
All right, Baynes,

91
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,360
请在这里停一下 这里的风景不错
will you stop here please

92
00:06:52,506 --> 00:06:54,973
cause this is a rather good view.

93
00:06:54,685 --> 00:06:58,734
那边就是King's Pyland 福尔摩斯先生
Now that's King's Pyland, over there Mr. Holmes.

94
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:01,235
我的驯马厩 马就在那里失踪的
You know my training stable

95
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,595
这的布局是什么样的 Ross上校?
where the missing horse was kept.

96
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:03,310
What exactly does your establishment consist of,

97
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:04,941
Colonel Ross?

98
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:08,284
那处是驯马师的房子
Well, there's the trainer's house,

99
00:07:08,357 --> 00:07:10,889
可怜的Straker和他的老婆住在一起
where poor Straker lived with his wife

100
00:07:10,926 --> 00:07:12,421
还有一个女仆
and a maidservant.

101
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,324
他跟在你身边多久了 先生
How long had he been with you sir?

102
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:16,626
哦 当了我五年的骑师
Oh, five years at jockey

103
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:18,730
直到他发福无法再上马
until he got too heavy for the weighing chair.

104
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:22,704
接下来七年做了我的驯马师
Then seven years as my trainer.

105
00:07:22,772 --> 00:07:25,468
是的 他水平一流
Yes, he was a first class man.

106
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,532
我猜更远处就是马厩
And I presume the stables are beyond?

107
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,046
是的 马场不大但是很不错
Yes, yes not a big yard, it's a good one.

108
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,674
我注重的是质量不是数量
My thought is quality not quantity.

109
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:36,752
在赛马场上活跃的人都可以告诉你这点 福尔摩斯先生
As anyone connected with the turf

110
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,730
谢谢 督察
will tell you, Mr. Holmes.

111
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,883
你看 现在
Yes, thank you, Inspector.

112
00:07:38,222 --> 00:07:39,883
You see, at the moment,

113
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:42,585
马场里只养了五匹马
I'm merely five horses in the yard.

114
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:46,270
我知道你让其中两匹参加了Wessex杯 Ross上校
I see you have two of them

115
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:46,086
entered for the Wessex Cup, Colonel Ross.

116
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,192
没错 是的
That's right, yes.

117
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,553
银额马和Bayard
Yes, Silver Blaze and Bayard.

118
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:54,035
可别说出去 派上Bayard是为了去领跑
But between us Bayard is intended for a pacemaker.

119
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:56,947
训练这么名贵的动物
Well with such valuable animals under his charge,

120
00:07:56,983 --> 00:07:58,443
我想你的驯马师Straker先生
I imagine your trainer Mr. Straker

121
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,872
一定采取了一些预防措施
must have taken some precautions.

122
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,006
哦 没有错
Oh yes indeed.

123
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:04,811
有三个小马倌和马匹一起生活
Three stable lads lived with the horses

124
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:09,123
天黑之后其中一个会在马厩值班
and after dark one of the lads

125
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,691
其他两个会睡在阁楼里
was always on duty in the stables

126
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:13,155
while the other two sleep above in loft.

127
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:15,331
那边是不是还有一个驯马场?
Is that another training stable over there?

128
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,391
是的 那里是Mapleton
Yes, that's Mapleton.

129
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:20,492
Backwater勋爵的马场
Lord Backwater's yard.

130
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:22,796
Backwater勋爵有匹Desberly
Lord Backwater?

131
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,457
是Wessex杯的二号种子吧
Lord Backwater owns Desberly,

132
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,766
是匹不错的马
second favorite for the Wessex Cup.

133
00:08:26,803 --> 00:08:29,172
但和银额马不是一个等级的
This is not a bad horse.

134
00:08:27,443 --> 00:08:30,003
Not in the same class as Silver Blaze.

135
00:08:29,998 --> 00:08:33,711
那个人叫Silas Brown
Fellow called, Silas Brown,

136
00:08:33,747 --> 00:08:36,650
是Backwater的驯马师 谜一样的人
trains for Backwater, [unintelligible] himself.

137
00:08:36,688 --> 00:08:38,936
连Straker也搞不懂他
Nor could Straker come to that.

138
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:41,918
我想是竞争对手的缘故吧
There's a natural rivalry I presume.

139
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:44,962
不止如此
Rather more than that.

140
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,042
我们可以继续走了吗?
Shall we drive on?

141
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,651
好的
Yes, indeed.

142
00:08:46,688 --> 00:08:48,751
走了 Baynes
All right, Baynes.

143
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:54,668
Gregory督察
Inspector Gregory,

144
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:58,082
对马匹去向的调查有没有进展?
are there any further developments

145
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,708
as to the where abouts of the horse?

146
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:59,516
完全没有
Nothing at all.

147
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:02,979
我们在这个方面几乎停滞不前
We have made very little progress

148
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:03,240
in that direction.

149
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:06,450
我不能想象像这样一匹银额马
I can't imagine how a horse like Silver Blaze

150
00:09:06,487 --> 00:09:08,215
会在这样的地方失踪
could go missing for so long in a place like this.

151
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,483
我也想不到
Nor can I.

152
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:11,750
我必须告诉你 福尔摩斯先生
I must tell you Mr. Holmes,

153
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:15,136
我一开始并不完全接受 Gregory督察的建议
that at first I was not at all taken

154
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:14,950
with Inspector Gregory's suggestion

155
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:17,483
把你请到这里来
that you should be asked to come down here.

156
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,863
我不喜欢业余的 明白吗?
I don't like amateurs you see?

157
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,970
Ha!

158
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:27,007
但是你还是给我发了电报 上校
But you did send me a telegram, Colonel.

159
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:30,669
看来没有别人可以找到我的马了
Well no one else seems to be able to find my horse.

160
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:33,476
如果你问我会是谁 我会说是那些
If you ask me it's these damn gypsies

161
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,573
散居在荒野上的该死的吉普赛浪人
wondering all over the moor.

162
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,777
早晚会出丑事 我说这话很多年了
It's a perfect scandal, I've said so for years.

163
00:09:37,854 --> 00:09:39,286
我的人在过去的两天中
My men have seen

164
00:09:39,354 --> 00:09:43,135
调查了在Dartmoor的每个吉普赛人 上校
every group of gypsies on Dartmoor

165
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,052
in the last two days, Colonel.

166
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:47,127
而且搜查了南Devon的每个马厩 采石场和洞穴
And searched every stable yard,

167
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,255
quarry and cave in south Devon.

168
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:49,595
这绝对是一个迷
It's an absolute mystery.

169
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,209
我期待你能创造奇迹 福尔摩斯先生
I expect a miracle from you, Mr. Holmes.

170
00:10:43,725 --> 00:10:44,817
Gregory督察
Inspector Gregory,

171
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:46,697
我在苏格兰场的朋友跟我说
my friends at Scotland Yard tell me

172
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:51,235
你在英国侦探圈中 迅速地建立了自己的声誉
that you're rapidly making a reputation for yourself

173
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,989
in the English detective service.

00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:54,407
我也是个热心学习您办案方法的学生 福尔摩斯先生
I'm a keen student of your methods too,

175
00:10:54,444 --> 00:10:56,666

00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,868
在这里 福尔摩斯先生
In here, Mr. Holmes.

179
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,063
他们是谁?
Who are they?

180
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,297
女仆Edith Baxter
Edith Baxter, the maid

181
00:11:57,373 --> 00:12:00,011
以及在星期一晚上值班的马童Hunter
and Hunter, the stable boy

182
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:00,871
who was on duty on Monday night.

183
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:14,384
那是九点刚过几分 先生
It was just a few minutes after nine o'clock, sir.

184
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,858
我端着Hunter先生的晚餐
I was carrying Mr. Hunter supper

185
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:17,834
要送到从对面的屋子去
across from the house.

186
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:20,420
但是 Baxter小姐
Awe, but Miss Baxter,

187
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:23,381
晚餐吃的是什么呢
what did the supper consist of?

188
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:25,787
是一盘咖喱羊肉 先生
It was a dish of curried mutton, sir.

189
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,982
突然我听见了一个男人的声音
Suddenly I heard a man's voice.

190
00:13:11,054 --> 00:13:14,905
我可以告诉你 先生 我完全没有心理准备
Did not give me a turn, I can tell you sir.

191
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,192
不好意思 小姐
Excuse me, Miss.

192
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,594
你想干什么 先生
What do you want, sir?

193
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:21,894
你能告诉我这是哪里吗
Can you tell me where I am?

194
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,160
就在我几乎决定露宿荒野的时候
I'd almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor

195
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,702
看见了这里的灯光
when I saw the light.

196
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:30,297
这里是King's Pyland驯马场 先生
This is King's Pyland training stable, sir.

197
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:35,210
那真是太走运了
What a stroke of luck.

198
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,045
我知道会有小马倌
I understand there's stable lad

199
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,176
晚上睡在里面
who sleeps here at night.

200
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,847
毫无疑问你端的是他的晚餐了
No doubt that's his supper you have there.

201
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,819
我相信你不会那么骄傲
I'm sure you wouldn't be too proud to earn

202
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:48,889
连一条新裙子的钱也不屑赚吧
yourself the price of a new dress would you?

203
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,362
看 今晚把这个给那男孩
See the boy has this tonight

204
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,202
你就能得到可以买一条最漂亮的连衣裙的钱
and you shall have the prettiest frock

205
00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:55,403
我不能要
money can buy.

206
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,995
I couldn't!

207
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,299
Ned!
Ned!

208
00:13:58,371 --> 00:13:59,963
Ned!
Ned!

209
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,872
Ned!
Ned!

210
00:14:01,943 --> 00:14:03,967
外面有一个男人拦住了我
There's a man stopped me out there.

211
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:05,513
我很害怕
I'm ever so frightened.

212
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,637
他想干什么
What did he want?

213
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,909
他问起了你
He asked after you.

214
00:14:07,983 --> 00:14:09,506
让我给你一些东西
He asked me to give you something.

215
00:14:09,584 --> 00:14:10,881
是什么
What was it?

216
00:14:10,952 --> 00:14:12,180
我不知道
I don't know.

217
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,552
是一样白色的东西
It was white.

218
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:14,714
他现在在哪
Where is he now?

219
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,883
他走了
He's gone.

220
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,653
你最好马上回屋去
We best cut back to the house quick.

221
00:14:18,728 --> 00:14:19,786
告诉老爷
Tell the governor!

222
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:21,557
好的 Ned
Yes Ned.

223
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:42,446
晚上好
Good evening.

224
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,214
我想和你说几句话
I want a word with you.

225
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,687
你来这里有什么事
What business have you here?

226
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:49,646
是件能让你的口袋鼓起来的买卖 小伙子
It's a business that may

227
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:49,727
put something in your pocket, my lad.

228
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:53,697
你现在有两匹参加Wessex杯的马
Now you've two horses entering the Wessex Cup,

229
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,778
银额马和Bayard
Silver Blaze and Bayard,

230
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,266
给我透点内幕
let me have the straight tip

231
00:14:57,336 --> 00:14:59,862
不会对你有坏处
and you won't be the loser.

232
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,043
Bayard真的可以在五弗隆的距离里 (约200米)
Is it the fact that at the weights Bayard

233
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,961
超过银额马一百码吗 所以大家...?
can give the other a hundred yards

234
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:07,823
你别想从我这里得到任何消息 滚!
and five furlongs in the...

235
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:06,971
You wont get any tips around here, get out!

236
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,416
追上他 追上他
After him boy, after him!

237
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,826
老爷和其他人已经来得很及时了
The governor and the others

238
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,995
came down soon enough.

239
00:15:25,863 --> 00:15:27,797
但我们没有找到那个男人的半点踪迹
We found not a sight or sound of the man.

240
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:29,201
等一下
One moment.

241
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:30,534
你把狗放出去之后
When you let the dog out

242
00:15:30,608 --> 00:15:32,871
门有没有关上?
did you leave the door open behind you?

243
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,671
问得好 华生 问得好
Oh excellent, Watson, excellent.

244
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:36,769
这正是我要问的
It's just the point I was going to make.

245
00:15:36,846 --> 00:15:38,404
我把门锁上了 先生
I locked the door behind me sir.

246
00:15:38,482 --> 00:15:41,385
-我发誓 -好孩子
I swear it.

247
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:40,480
Good lad.

248
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:49,257
Fitzroy Simpson认罪了吗?
Does Fitzroy Simpson admit to all this?

249
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,698
他对此全盘否认
He denies nothing.

250
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:57,351
他说来这是为了买消息
He says he came for information.

251
00:15:57,388 --> 00:15:58,639
那张白条是什么?
What about the white paper?

252
00:15:58,676 --> 00:16:01,537
他说那是一张五镑纸币
He says it was a five-pound note.

253
00:16:07,249 --> 00:16:09,093
接下来发生了什么
What happened next?

254
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:11,339
先生
Well sir,

255
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,477
那是天刚亮的时候
it was about dawn

256
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:15,351
女主人走进我的卧室
when the mistress came into my bedroom

257
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,287
叫我跟她走
and told me to come with her.

258
00:16:17,357 --> 00:16:21,527
当她醒来时发现Straker先生的床是空的
Well when she woke

259
00:16:19,026 --> 00:16:21,494
she'd found Mr. Straker's bed empty.

260
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,803
天啊
Heavens!

261
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:36,776
马不见了
The horse is gone...

262
00:16:36,847 --> 00:16:39,320
还有马勒 (安放在马头周围 用来牵引的马具)
and the bridle.

263
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,916
Ned 醒醒
Ned, wake up!

264
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,082
把他叫醒
Wake the boys.

265
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,182
Ned
Ned!

266
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:49,923
Ned
Ned!

267
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,725
醒醒! 醒醒Ned!
Wake up.

268
00:16:51,195 --> 00:16:52,855
Wake up, Ned!

269
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,463
Bill! Robbie! 快来!
Bill, Robbie come quick,

270
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,891
银额马不见了
Silver Blaze is gone.

271
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,299
这边
Over here.

272
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:17,317
他死了 先生
He was dead sir.

273
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,881
他的头...
His head

274
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:24,260
被打得陷进去了一块
it was all knocked in.

275
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,395
实在是太可怕了
It was terrible.

276
00:18:54,597 --> 00:18:57,416
头部受到了某种钝器的重击
It was a terrible blow on the head

277
00:18:57,453 --> 00:18:58,969
这就是他的死因
from some blunt instrument

278
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:59,661
that had killed him.

279
00:18:59,736 --> 00:19:03,957
很明显他曾拼命抵抗过
It was clear that he had

280
00:19:01,138 --> 00:19:03,697
defended himself most vigorously.

281
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,224
一把血迹斑斑的小刀
The blood stained knife.

282
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:09,066
和大腿上伤口 你们说呢
As to the wound on the thigh, who can tell?

283
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:14,382
腿上的伤口可能是 Straker摔倒的时候造成的
Well it is possible that the wound on the thigh

284
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:13,776
could have been caused as Straker fell.

285
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,046
那个男孩被下药了
The lad here was drugged.

286
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:21,064
在他的咖喱中有一定分量的麻醉药
Appreciable quantities of powered opium

287
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,387
were found in his carry.

288
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,359
所有人吃得都是一样的吗
Did all the household eat the same dish?

289
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:24,895
是的 先生
Yes sir.

290
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,093
我亲自下厨再端上餐桌
I made it myself and served it.

291
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,301
这条黑红色的围巾
This black and red scarf?

292
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,735
那位先生跟我说话时就是戴着这条围巾
The gentleman was wearing that scarf

293
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:40,007
我可以在圣经面前发誓 先生
when he talked to me.

294
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:40,007
I'd swear that on the Bible, sir.

295
00:19:40,081 --> 00:19:41,881
谢谢你 华生
Thank you Watson.

296
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:43,058
谢谢
Thank you.

297
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:55,508
别这样 别这样!
Stop it boy.

298
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:56,646
来吧 乖狗狗
Stop it.

299
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,433
乖狗狗
Come on.

300
00:19:56,564 --> 00:19:58,156
Good dog.

301
00:19:58,232 --> 00:20:00,166
Good boy.

302
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:07,851
我的理论是
My theory is that Simpson

303
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,499
Simpson是想方设法收买情报
was under some strong obligation to Nobble

304
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:12,476
或者用别的法子让马无法上场
or otherwise incapacitate this horse

305
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:14,786
不能参加Wessex杯
so that he would be unable to run in the Wessex Cup.

306
00:20:14,823 --> 00:20:17,383
在男孩的饭里下麻醉药倒是挺聪明
Clever move that, putting opium in the boy's food

307
00:20:17,421 --> 00:20:19,046
利用那窗户很容易得手
and easy enough through that window.

308
00:20:19,082 --> 00:20:21,228
是的 下面就简单了
Yes.

309
00:20:19,356 --> 00:20:20,878
Then it was simple.

310
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,054
他用一把复制好的钥匙
He obtained a duplicate key,

311
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:25,091
把马牵了出去
led out the horse,

312
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:26,057
但他运气不好
it was his bad luck

313
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,928
Straker很警觉 追踪他到了野外
that Straker was alert enough

314
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:28,865
to catch him up on the moor,

315
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,798
在对抗中 马逃走了
in the struggle the horse bolted.

316
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,268
没有证据说明
That's no proof

317
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:34,328
Simpson杀了Straker
that Simpson killed Straker.

318
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:36,752
我们有足够对他不利的证据
Well the evidence against him is very strong.

319
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,100
毫无疑问他来这有不可告人的目的
He was undoubtedly here on some devious business.

320
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:40,252
他给马倌下了毒
He poisoned the stable lad.

321
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,010
他手上有一根很沉的铅头手杖
He had in his hand a heavy stick

322
00:20:41,347 --> 00:20:42,609
weighted with lead

323
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:45,439
而且在死者的手上有他的围巾
and his scarf was found

324
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,442
in the dead man's hand.

325
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:48,120
当我用这些和他对质时 他面如死灰
And he went pale as death

326
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:50,695
我真的认为在陪审团面前 证据是游刃有余了
when I confronted him with that fact.

327
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,449
I really think we have enough

328
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,885
不 不
to go before a jury.

329
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,983
不
No, no.

330
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,175
督察
No.

331
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,721
一个聪明点的律师完全可以把它们驳倒
Inspector?

332
00:20:54,528 --> 00:20:57,258
A cleaver council would tear it all to rags.

333
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,913
-在他身上发现了复制钥匙吗 -没有
Has a duplicate key been found in his possession?

334
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,061
是哪个药剂师把麻醉药卖给他的?
No.

335
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:03,061
Well what chemist sold him the powered opium?

336
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,108
更重要的是
And above all how could he,

337
00:21:04,145 --> 00:21:06,765
一个陌生人是怎么在这里把一匹马藏起来了
a stranger in this district,

338
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:08,276
更何况是一匹这样的银额马
hide a horse and such a horse as Silver Blaze?

339
00:21:08,314 --> 00:21:10,968
我同意证据都是间接的
I agree the evidence is circumstantial

340
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:13,796
但我认为布在 Fitzroy Simpson周围的网很紧密
but I think the net is drawn pretty tightly

341
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,684
我相信他已经是网中鱼
around Fitzroy Simpson

342
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:17,683
and I believe he is our man.

343
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:21,949
他是一个怎样的人? 为什么会做出这种事呢?
What sort of fellow is he

344
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:21,689
and why would he do such a thing?

345
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:25,961
Fitzroy Simpson出身于名门望族
Fitzroy Simpson is a man of

346
00:21:23,326 --> 00:21:25,521
excellent birth and dedication.

347
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:29,077
很不幸地他在赛马场上 输掉了一大笔财富
Unfortunately he has

348
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:28,553
squandered a fortune on the turf,

349
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:30,286
导致他负债累累
which has put him in the hands of moneylenders

350
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:32,588
并且成为一个不择手段的赌马人
and unscrupulous bookmakers.

351
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,897
在赛马场上确实有这样的人
Plenty of those sharks in the racing world.

352
00:21:33,971 --> 00:21:36,026
我不知道你也会赌 华生
I didn't know that

353
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,215
什么? 我只是...
you were a betting man, Watson.

354
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,301
What?

355
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:40,929
偶尔在赛马上下笔小赌注
Oh, just the occasional flutter.

356
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,634
我猜你们有了份Straker死时
I presume an inventory has been made

357
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:46,875
他口袋里物件的清单
of what Straker had in his pockets

358
00:21:46,912 --> 00:21:50,905
如果你想看的话 东西就在我的客厅里
at the time of his death?

359
00:21:46,985 --> 00:21:48,248
I have the things themselves

360
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,685
in the sitting room

361
00:21:49,756 --> 00:21:51,450
if you would care to see them.

362
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:16,720
伦敦Weiss公司
Weiss & Co., London.

363
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,591
从血迹来看 我猜这就是死者抓着的刀
From the bloodstains, I presume,

364
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,546
this is the knife that was found

365
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:21,868
没错
in the dead man's grasp.

366
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,653
这更接近你的专业 医生
Yes indeed.

367
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,653
This is more in your line, Doctor.

368
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:28,369
是我们所称的为眼翳刀 (用于割除角膜组织的翳状赘肉)
This is what we call a cataract knife.

369
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,857
非常锋利的刀刃
Very delicate blade

370
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:31,725
专门用于非常精密的手术
devised for very delicate work.

371
00:22:31,801 --> 00:22:35,410
会有人如此随身携带可真稀奇 福尔摩斯
Strange thing for a man to take

372
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:35,533
on so rough an expedition, Holmes,

373
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,630
怎么会没有戳破他的口袋呢
especially as it wouldn't shut in his pocket.

374
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:41,622
在尸体旁 我们找到了小刀的软木圆鞘
Awe, the tip was guarded by a disc of cork,

375
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,639
which we found beside the body.

376
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:43,178
你很出色 督察
You impress me, Inspector.

377
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:43,816
谢谢
Thank you.

378
00:22:43,853 --> 00:22:46,417
Straker夫人说原来它是放在梳妆台上
Mrs. Straker says it was on the dressing table.

379
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,287
这可能是他当时最随手可得的东西了
It was probably

380
00:22:48,324 --> 00:22:49,475
我明白了
the nearest thing to him at the time.

381
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:51,772
我明白了
I see.

382
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,320
马料商的账单
I see.

383
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,849
Corn merchants bill.

384
00:22:54,926 --> 00:22:57,895
Colonel Ross上校的指示信
Instructions from Colonel Ross.

385
00:22:57,963 --> 00:23:00,795
这个又是什么?
Awe what have we here?

386
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:02,869
一张女衣店账单
A milliner's account

387
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:04,484
三十七镑十五先令
for thirty-seven pounds fifteen shillings

388
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,495
伦敦邦德街Lesurier夫人开具
for a Madame Lesurier,

389
00:23:05,372 --> 00:23:07,340
of Bond Street, London,

390
00:23:07,533 --> 00:23:09,467
给William Derbyshire先生
to a Mr. William Derbyshire.

391
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:12,030
Straker女士告诉我们 Derbyshire是他丈夫的一个朋友
Mrs. Straker tells us

392
00:23:10,443 --> 00:23:11,638
that Derbyshire was a friend of her husband's

393
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:14,844
偶尔他的信会寄到这里
and on occasionally

394
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:15,014
had his letters addressed here.

395
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:17,515
二十二基尼(金币 值21先令)
Twenty-two guineas.

396
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:20,986
对一件衣服来说贵了点
Somewhat heavy for a single costume.

397
00:23:21,055 --> 00:23:23,181
Derbyshire夫人喜欢贵的东西
Mrs. Derbyshire had rather expensive taste.

398
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:24,485
是的
Yes.

399
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,863
看来没有其他有用的东西了 督察
Well there appears to be

400
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:27,358
nothing more to learn here, Inspector,

401
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,269
我们去犯罪现场吧
shall we move onto the scene of the crime?

402
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:30,934
好的 当然
Yes, of course.

403
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,136
你先 华生
After you Watson.

404
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,974
你抓住他们了吗 督察
Have you got them, Inspector?

405
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:48,212
有什么新消息吗
Is there any more news?

406
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:50,698
恐怕没有 Straker夫人
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Straker.

407
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,732
但是福尔摩斯先生和华生医生
But Mr. Holmes and Doctor Watson

408
00:23:52,769 --> 00:23:54,911
从伦敦赶来协助我们
have come down from London to help us.

409
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,399
我跟你保证 我们会全力以赴
I assure you we're doing everything possible.

410
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:01,223
祝你好运 福尔摩斯先生
I wish you good luck, Mr. Holmes.

411
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,128
谢谢你 夫人 我对你的损失深表遗憾
Oh thank you madam and my commiserations

412
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:05,362
on your great loss.

413
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:07,953
我们肯定见过面吧?
Surely we've met?

414
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,724
之前在Plymouth的游园会上
At a garden party

415
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:13,034
in Plymouth some time ago.

416
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,511
没有 先生
No sir.

417
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,945
你弄错了
You are mistaken.

418
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:18,210
不 我可是非常肯定的
No, do you know I could have sworn it.

419
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:22,153
你穿着一件浅灰色丝绸衣服
You wore a costume of dove-colored silk

420
00:24:22,223 --> 00:24:25,784
上面有鸵鸟毛做的装饰物
with ostrich feather trimming.

421
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,009
我从来没有这样的衣服 先生
I never had such a dress, sir.

422
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:34,040
那就清楚了 谢谢你
That quite settles it.

423
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,301
Thank you.

424
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,878
这就是挂着外套的灌木
That is the bush where the coat was hanging.

425
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:43,075
那天天气怎么样
What was the weather like?

426
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:45,669
没什么风 雨挺大
Wind calm bit of rain about.

427
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:49,166
那外套不是被风吹到灌木上 而是人挂的
And the coat was not blown against the bush

428
00:24:49,203 --> 00:24:50,374
哦 是的 是被人放的
but placed there?

429
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,638
督察
Oh yes, it was placed.

430
00:24:51,676 --> 00:24:54,258
不 不 不好
Inspector!

431
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:55,551
No, no, no!

432
00:24:56,281 --> 00:25:00,048
这片土地被太多人踏过
So many people have trampled around this land.

433
00:25:03,323 --> 00:25:05,293
一定有很多人到过
There have been many people here.

434
00:25:05,329 --> 00:25:08,912
那张垫子是故意摆在那里 供大家落脚的
That piece of matting has been placed there

435
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,537
and we have all stood upon there.

436
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,130
可老百姓不是
Not the general public.

437
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:12,267
我这个袋子里面有...
I have in this bag

438
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,472
John Straker穿的一只靴子
one of the boots John Straker wore,

439
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,175
一只Fitzroy Simpson的鞋子
one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes,

440
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,152
一块银额马的马蹄铁
and a cast horseshoe of Silver Blaze.

441
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,121
谢谢你 督察
Thank you, Inspector.

442
00:26:37,538 --> 00:26:42,270
燃了一半的蜡烛
Half burned wax candle.

443
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:45,869
不敢相信我居然忽视了它们
I cannot understand how I came to overlook them.

444
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:48,744
它们被埋在土里 自然看不见了
Oh they're invisible, buried in the mud.

445
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,392
我能看见是因为我找的就是它们
I only saw them because I was looking for them.

446
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:54,347
什么 你早料到能发现它们?
What, you expected to find them?

447
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:56,837
我认为这并不是不可能的
I thought it not unlikely.

448
00:26:59,462 --> 00:27:01,486
恐怕这里没有其他线索了
I'm afraid there are no more tracks.

449
00:27:01,564 --> 00:27:05,243
周围一百码之内都检查过了
I've examined the ground

450
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,299
for a hundred yards in every direction.

451
00:27:05,368 --> 00:27:07,301
真是个愉快的夜晚啊
What a pleasant evening.

452
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:09,450
我想我要去散个步了 伸伸腿
I think I'll take a walk, stretch my legs.

453
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,035
-华生 -没错
Watson?

454
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:12,539
这个我带走了 为了好运
Yes, indeed.

455
00:27:12,576 --> 00:27:14,217
屋里还有事等着我做
I'll take this for luck.

456
00:27:14,254 --> 00:27:16,759
之后Ross上校会来接我们回Tavistock
I have some work to do in the house,

457
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:15,743
then Colonel Ross is coming

458
00:27:15,812 --> 00:27:19,213
to take us back to Tavistock.

459
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:22,207
晚安 警官
Good evening, Constable.

460
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,532
假设银额马挣脱了缰绳
Suppose that Silver Blaze broke away,

461
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,802
那它会跑到哪里去呢
where would he have gone?

462
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,869
如果它还在旷野上晃悠
If he'd run loose on the moor

463
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:18,789
到现在肯定会被人看到了
he'd have surely been seen by now.

464
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:20,779
可能那个吉普赛人的理论是正确的
Perhaps the gypsy theory's correct.

465
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,876
不 不 不 不
No, no, no, no.

466
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:29,859
马是非常喜欢群居的生物
A horse is a most gregarious creature.

467
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:33,579
既然它没有回到King's Pyland自己的马厩
Now he did not go back to King's Pyland

468
00:28:33,617 --> 00:28:38,546
那就一定是去了...Mapleton
to his own stable,

469
00:28:33,531 --> 00:28:35,964
so he must have gone...

470
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:39,765
to Mapleton.

471
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,365
现在我们以此为假设
Now let us use that as a working hypothesis.

472
00:28:43,441 --> 00:28:45,837
这片土地十分干硬
The ground around here is very hard and dry

473
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:48,207
但是那边的低洼地
but over there in that hollow

474
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:51,019
在星期一的晚上肯定是很湿润
it must have been very wet on Monday night.

475
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:55,652
如果我们的假设是正确的
If our supposition is correct,

476
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:58,353
它肯定去过那里
he must have crossed it.

477
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:16,105
华生
Watson!

478
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:28,610
天 看看这个
By George, look at that.

479
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:33,706
你瞧见了想象力的可贵
You see the value of imagination

480
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:37,420
这正是Gregory督察缺少的一项资质
is the one quality,

481
00:29:34,865 --> 00:29:36,957
which Inspector Gregory lacks.

482
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:39,450
我们想象可能发生的事情
We imagined what might have happened,

483
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:40,918
然后采取行动
acted upon the supposition,

484
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:42,944
最后发现是有道理的
and find ourselves justified.

485
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:44,146
让我们继续吧
Let us proceed.

486
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:11,141
看...看!
Look!

487
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:11,130
Look!

488
00:30:25,887 --> 00:30:35,049
马和人...都折回了
Horse and man turned.

489
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,735
"Mapleton驯马场 闲人禁入"

490
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,419
这里不准闲人逗留
No loitering around here.

491
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,551
你没长眼睛吗
Haven't you got eyes in your head.

492
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,458
我只是想问你一个问题
I only wanted to ask you a question.

493
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:09,523
要是明天早晨五点我来拜访 Silas Brown先生 会不会太早了
Should I be too early

494
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:06,856
to see Mr. Silas Brown,

495
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,125
if I was to call around here

496
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,475
我不应该跟你说话
at five-thirty tomorrow morning?

497
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:12,162
I shouldn't be speaking to you by rights.

498
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:18,873
给 男孩
Here lad

499
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:23,075
please accept.

500
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,515
Bless you, sir.

501
00:31:24,585 --> 00:31:27,314
You're a gentleman.

502
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:30,428
Brown先生是这里起最早的
Mr. Brown's the early bird

503
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:31,516
Dawson
around here all right.

504
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:34,153
你跟陌生人说三道四的干什么
Dawson?

505
00:31:31,593 --> 00:31:34,153
What are you doing gossiping with strangers?

506
00:31:34,229 --> 00:31:36,662
干你自己的事去
Be about your business.

507
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,727
你们两个在这里想干什么
Now what the devil do you two want around here?

508
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:42,465
只占用你一点时间 Brown先生
Just a few minutes of your time, Mr. Brown.

509
00:31:42,502 --> 00:31:47,807
离开这里 不然你就会被狗追着跑
Be off with you

510
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:47,173
or you'll find the dog on your heels.

511
00:31:47,844 --> 00:31:51,373
我为什么要和所有 在这旷野上游荡的陌生人说话?
Why should I talk every

512
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:50,843
gadabout stranger on the moor?

513
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:58,186
或许能让你免于被Blackwaters勋爵解雇
It may save you instant dismissal

514
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:57,949
from Lord Blackwaters' service

515
00:31:58,223 --> 00:32:01,549
不会锒铛入狱
and the stiffest prison sentence.

516
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:12,427
留心周围
Keep guard.

517
00:32:21,781 --> 00:32:26,183
星期二一大早
Early Tuesday morning,

518
00:32:26,253 --> 00:32:29,711
你像平时一样巡视马场
you're about the yard as usual,

519
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:36,786
看见了一匹马在沼泽里
when you saw a horse on the moor.

520
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,747
等你靠近它时你意识到
When you approached it you realized

521
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,243
这完全不是一匹陌生的马
that it wasn't a strange horse at all.

522
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:44,232
是你熟知的一匹马 了如指掌
It was one that you knew, very well.

523
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:48,602
你的第一个反应就是带着银…
Your first instinct was to lead Silver...

524
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:52,843
银额马回到King's Pyland
Silver Blaze back to King's Pyland

525
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,115
但是随即你有了其他邪恶的想法
but then the devil put

526
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:57,147
other ideas into your head.

527
00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:01,245
你有了赚一笔大钱的机会
You have a chance to make a great deal of money.

528
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:07,070
你突然反应过来 如果把马藏起来...
It occurred to you

529
00:33:03,393 --> 00:33:06,693
that if you were to hide the horse...

530
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:16,097
你一直在看着我 对吧
You've been watching me haven't you?

531
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:20,235
你在监视我 先生
You've been spying on me, sir.

532
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,415
那么
Now.

533
00:33:28,486 --> 00:33:31,944
瞧 先生
Sir.

534
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:36,488
你想让我做什么都行
I do what you want.

535
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:49,249
如果你要钱...
If it's money you want

536
00:33:49,286 --> 00:33:52,634
会给你...
you shall have it.

537
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:03,538
我怎么说你就怎么做
You will do exactly as I tell you.

538
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:20,737
我很少见到像Silas Brown这样的 集霸道 怯懦和狡猾于一体的完美的组合
A more perfect compound

539
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:17,530
of the bully, coward and sneak

540
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,040
that Master Silas Brown

541
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,235
I've seldom met with.

542
00:34:20,773 --> 00:34:21,277
那么说马在他那里?
He has the horse then?

543
00:34:21,345 --> 00:34:22,573
当然
Of course.

544
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:24,410
但是他的马厩被搜过
But his stables have been searched.

545
00:34:24,482 --> 00:34:27,725
像他这样的作假老手 知道很多伎俩
An old faker like him

546
00:34:26,051 --> 00:34:28,747
knows many a dodge.

547
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,904
华生我不知道你是否注意到
Watson, I didn't know whether you observed

548
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:34,591
但是Ross上校地举止有点傲慢
but Colonel Ross' manner

549
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:34,351
has been somewhat cavalier.

550
00:34:34,628 --> 00:34:37,870
我想要对他开点玩笑
I'm inclined to have a little amusement

551
00:34:36,228 --> 00:34:37,626
at his expense.

552
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,585
不要向他透露任何马的事情
Say nothing to him about the horse.

553
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,878
没有你的允许 我什么都不会说
I shall say nothing without your permission.

554
00:34:41,915 --> 00:34:43,167
非常好
Splendid.

555
00:34:43,536 --> 00:34:45,026
从我们找到的线索来看
We have found traces,

556
00:34:45,105 --> 00:34:48,428
星期一晚上在凶案现场一英里之外
which show that a party of gypsies

557
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:48,104
encamped on Monday night

558
00:34:48,465 --> 00:34:50,951
吉普赛人在露营开过派对
within a mile of where the murder took place.

559
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:53,886
Fitzroy Simpson可能跟他们商量好了
Fitzroy Simpson

560
00:34:51,912 --> 00:34:53,435
may well have an understanding with them

561
00:34:53,923 --> 00:34:56,196
来把马藏起来
over hiding the horse.

562
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,119
尽管如此
Nevertheless,

563
00:34:57,156 --> 00:35:00,125
让银额马退出比赛
I think I owe it to the public

564
00:35:00,163 --> 00:35:03,633
让我依然觉得有愧于大家
to remove Silver Blaze's name

565
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:03,053
for the entrance for the cup.

566
00:35:03,669 --> 00:35:04,511
不  当然不行
No, certainly not!

567
00:35:04,549 --> 00:35:06,648
上校 我会让这个名字留下
Colonel, I should let the name stand.

568
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,557
但是我已经让Bayard退出了
But I've already withdrawn Bayard.

569
00:35:08,594 --> 00:35:12,821
但是我有把握让银额马在星期六上场
But I have every hope

570
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:12,192
that Silver Blaze will start on Saturday.

571
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:14,400
让你的骑师做准备吧
Have your jockey at readiness.

572
00:35:14,437 --> 00:35:18,095
我很高兴听到你的观点 先生
I'm very glad to have your opinion, sir.

573
00:35:18,841 --> 00:35:24,382
当然跟谁杀了John Straker比 这只是个次要问题
That is a minor point, of course,

574
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,341
compared with the question

575
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,345
of who killed John Straker.

576
00:35:24,419 --> 00:35:27,603
毫无疑问你会专注于这个问题
Doubtless you will be devoting yourself

577
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,857
正好相反 华生医生和我
to that problem.

578
00:35:27,718 --> 00:35:29,548
On the contrary, Doctor Watson and I

579
00:35:29,894 --> 00:35:32,882
会坐夜间特快回伦敦
were taking the Night Express to London.

580
00:35:32,919 --> 00:35:37,910
我们已经呼吸过了你们这 诱人的新鲜空气
We've had the most charming little breath

581
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,055
of your country air.

582
00:35:39,723 --> 00:35:44,488
所以你已经对缉拿杀害 John Strake的凶手丧失信心了
So you've despaired already of arresting

583
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:43,964
the murderer of poor John Straker.

584
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,642
困难重重
With our certain grave difficulties.

585
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,880
你有Straker的照片吗
Do you have the photograph of Straker?

586
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,289
谢谢 督察
Thank you, Inspector.

587
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:54,120
我已经准备好去Tavistock了
I am quite ready now for Tavistock.

588
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,271
留在这
Linger.

589
00:35:59,092 --> 00:36:04,289
我必须说我对我们伦敦的顾问非常失望
I must say I am rather disappointed

590
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:04,013
in our London consultant.

591
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:07,126
我没有看到他来之后有任何的进展
I don't see that were any further than when he came.

592
00:36:07,163 --> 00:36:10,390
但是至少他保证了你的马可以参赛 上校
But at least you have his assurance Colonel

593
00:36:08,395 --> 00:36:09,919
that your horse will run.

594
00:36:10,427 --> 00:36:12,175
哦 是的 他是保证了
Oh yes, I have his assurance.

595
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,051
但我宁愿得到马
I should prefer to have the horse.

596
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,776
我觉得你应该采纳 福尔摩斯先生的建议 上校
I think you should

597
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:17,693
heed Mr. Holmes advice, Colonel.

598
00:36:18,334 --> 00:36:20,162
看情况再说吧
Well I shall have to see.

599
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:34,620
不好意思 是谁在照看这些羊?
Excuse me,

600
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:36,116
是我 先生
whom looks after these sheep?

601
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:36,548
I do, sir.

602
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:38,858
你有注意到它们最近有什么毛病吗
Have you noticed anything amiss of late?

603
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,399
没有 先生
No sir.

604
00:36:41,436 --> 00:36:42,228
那也许算不上
Well it's not much account,

605
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:44,983
但是有三只羊的脚跛了
but three of them have gone lame.

606
00:36:47,384 --> 00:36:48,943
谢谢
Thank you.

607
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,878
大胆的推测 华生 很大胆的推测 你先请
A long shot, Watson, a very long shot.

608
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,274
After you.

609
00:36:54,915 --> 00:37:00,458
督察 我建议你注意下羊群中 这种奇异病症吧
Inspector I would like to recommend to you

610
00:36:56,182 --> 00:37:00,141
the singular epidemic among the sheep.

611
00:37:00,779 --> 00:37:03,604
你真的认为那很重要
You really consider that to be important?

612
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:05,077
非常重要
Exceedingly so.

613
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,054
走了 Baynes
All right Baynes.

614
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:24,184
你还需要我注意其它一些问题吗 福尔摩斯先生?
Is there any other point

615
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:25,111
to which you wish to draw my attention, Mr. Holmes?

616
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:30,067
那天夜里 狗的反应很奇怪
To the curious incident

617
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,712
of the dog in the nighttime.

618
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:33,501
但是那天夜里 狗没什么反应啊
But the dog did nothing in the nighttime.

619
00:37:33,538 --> 00:37:35,655
那正是奇怪的地方
That is the curious incident.

620
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,597
我的马到底在哪里 福尔摩斯?
Where the devil is my horse, Holmes?

621
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:10,729
不 不 不 不 它到底在哪?
No, no, no, no,

622
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,337
我猜 上校
Where the devil is he?

623
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:15,197
如果你看见了 就可以认出它吧
I suppose, Colonel,

624
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:14,428
that you would recognize him

625
00:38:15,234 --> 00:38:17,528
认出我自己的马?!
if you saw him?

626
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:19,713
我在赛马场上活跃了二十年了
Know my own horse?

627
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,802
I have been on the turf for twenty years

628
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:22,533
以前从来没有被这么问过 这样该死的傻问题
and I've never been asked

629
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,776
即使是一个孩子也知道
such a damn fool question before.

630
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:25,271
A child would know Silver Blaze

631
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:29,625
银额马的额头上有块白色的星型 后腿上有斑点
with the white star on his forehead

632
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:29,945
and mottled hind leg.

633
00:38:29,662 --> 00:38:32,562
我想你能意识到如果我的马不上场
I suppose you realize if my horse doesn't run,

634
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,763
除了很可能会被人群报复
quite a part from being lynched by the crowd,

635
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,933
我还要去向赛马调查委员会自首
I shall be up before the Stewards'.

636
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,290
可能会被每个英格兰的赛马场永远禁赛
Probably warned off

637
00:38:40,326 --> 00:38:41,449
声败名裂
every racecourse in England for life.

638
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,567
哦 希望不会发展到那个地步 上校
Reputation ruined.

639
00:38:42,064 --> 00:38:44,725
Awe, let us hope it does not come to that, Colonel.

640
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,086
这是华生医生
Here's Doctor Watson.

641
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,891
而这匹 上校...
And this, Colonel,

642
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:56,544
就是你的马
is your horse.

643
00:38:57,647 --> 00:39:00,197
那不是我的马 福尔摩斯
But that's not my horse, Holmes!

644
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,323
我的天啊 你都干了些什么
Good God man, what have you done?

645
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:36,177
上校啊 这就是你的银额马
There Colonel is your Silver Blaze.

646
00:39:37,168 --> 00:39:39,150
我从盗马贼手里发现了它
I found him in the hands of a faker

647
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:42,931
原封不动带回了这里
and brought him to the course just as he was.

648
00:39:46,668 --> 00:39:48,114
老天爷
Good heavens.

649
00:39:50,772 --> 00:39:53,454
你太让我激动了 福尔摩斯先生
You take my breath away, Mr. Holmes.

650
00:40:39,025 --> 00:40:40,074
银额马
Silver Blaze.

651
00:40:40,248 --> 00:40:41,853
如果它还参赛的话
If he runs me lord

652
00:40:41,853 --> 00:40:43,526
就会赢得名次吧 阁下
to win a place me lord?

653
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:45,013
当然会
To win, of course.

654
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:50,763
还有谁会像你吗?
Any more like you at home?

655
00:41:07,285 --> 00:41:10,137
快跑 银额马 跑啊!

656
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,066
快点
Run Silver Blaze, run!

657
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,661
那匹该死的马到底是怎么回事啊
Come on!

658
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:15,127
What's the matter with the damn horse?

659
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:16,947
福尔摩斯 你对它做了什么
What have you done to him Holmes?

660
00:41:17,511 --> 00:41:19,716
它失去了当领跑者的本领
He seems to be missing his pacemaker.

661
00:41:19,716 --> 00:41:22,313
我不应该让Bayard退出
I should have never withdrawn Bayard.

662
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:25,408
等一下 他突破重围了
Wait a minute he's breaking through.

663
00:41:27,953 --> 00:41:32,778
加油 银额马!
Come on Silver Blaze.

664
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,506
Come on Silver Blaze.

665
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:32,982
Silver Blaze!

666
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:37,276
快跑 快跑!
Go on.

667
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:35,116
Go on.

668
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:36,085
Go on.

669
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:38,884
Go on.

670
00:42:04,218 --> 00:42:06,545
你创造了奇迹 福尔摩斯先生
You've done wonders Mr. Holmes,

671
00:42:06,545 --> 00:42:09,392
我欠你几千个道歉
and I owe you a thousand apologies

672
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:11,785
因为我怀疑了你的能力
for having doubted your ability.

673
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:17,292
你找回了我的马 出色得完成了工作
Now you've done me a great service

674
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:17,455
by recovering my horse.

675
00:42:17,534 --> 00:42:22,564
如果你可以抓住杀害 John Straker的凶手的话就更好了
You'd do me a greater still

676
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:20,929
if you could lay your hands

677
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:24,433
我已经抓住了
on the murderer of John Straker.

678
00:42:22,705 --> 00:42:24,570
I've done so.

679
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:25,610
什么?
What?

680
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,349
如果你已经得手 他现在人呢?
What's all this about if you got him.

681
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,498
他就在这里
Where is he then?

682
00:42:29,498 --> 00:42:31,282
这里 哪里?
He's here.

683
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:33,751
此时...此地
Here!

684
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:32,340
Where?

685
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,783
Some who's now present at this very moment.

686
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,569
是的 我很清楚
Yes I quite recognize

687
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,358
自己欠你一份人情 福尔摩斯先生
that I'm under obligations to you Mr. Holmes,

688
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:42,704
但如果这不是一个非常烂的笑话 就是一种侮辱
but this either a very bad joke or an insult.

689
00:42:42,704 --> 00:42:46,552
哦 上校 真正的杀人犯 就站在你的后面
Oh the real murderer, Colonel,

690
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:48,190
is standing immediately behind you.

691
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:49,667
什么 这匹马
What the horse?

692
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,330
是的 这匹马
Yes, the horse.

693
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:59,767
如果我说它完全是自卫才这么做 也许可以减轻它的罪过
And it may lessen his guilt if I say

694
00:42:55,409 --> 00:43:00,073
that it was done entirely in self-defense,

695
00:42:59,768 --> 00:43:02,060
而且John Straker这个人
and that John Straker

696
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:06,241
完全不值得你的信任
was a man quite unworthy of your trust.

697
00:43:15,864 --> 00:43:18,058
四号 先生 第一名
Number four, sir, winner.

698
00:43:39,924 --> 00:43:40,853
快来 Ross
Come Ross.

699
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:45,285
好的 非常感谢
Yes, thank you very much.

700
00:43:57,342 --> 00:44:00,709
Thank you very much.

701
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:11,758
十二号
Number twelve.

702
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:13,587
十二号
Number twelve.

703
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:26,029
我非常引以为豪
Very proud of it.

704
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:28,667
很骄傲
Very proud.

705
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:29,971
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

706
00:44:30,046 --> 00:44:31,909
谢谢
Thank you.

707
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:48,854
我承认 先生们
I confess, gentlemen,

708
00:44:48,855 --> 00:44:50,075
当我们来King's Pylan的时候
when we came down to King's Pylan,

709
00:44:50,075 --> 00:44:53,286
我曾经被说服了Fitzroy Simpson就是真凶
I was convinced that Fitzroy Simpson

710
00:44:53,287 --> 00:44:56,954
所有的报纸和警方的报告 似乎都指向那一点
was the true culprit.

711
00:44:53,671 --> 00:44:55,604
All the newspaper and police reports

712
00:44:55,674 --> 00:44:57,733
seemed to point to it.

713
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:00,890
直到我进入驯马师房里
It was only when

714
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:00,942
I entered the trainer's house

715
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:05,513
想起了咖喱羊肉具有重要意义
that the immense significance

716
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:05,582
of the curried mutton occurred to me.

717
00:45:05,514 --> 00:45:07,389
我要承认即使到现在
I confess that even now

718
00:45:07,389 --> 00:45:09,793
我还不能明白它对我们有什么帮助
I cannot see how it helps us.

719
00:45:09,794 --> 00:45:11,322
麻醉药 上校
Powdered opium, Colonel,

720
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:13,599
绝对不会完全无味
is by no means tasteless.

721
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,482
我说的对吗?
I am correct?

722
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:16,996
哦 完全正确
Oh quite correct.

723
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:19,123
味道不至于难吃
The flavor is not distasteful

724
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,330
但是它是可以尝出来的
but it is perceptible.

725
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,495
如果它混在一般的饭菜里
Were it mixed with an ordinary dish

726
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:24,149
吃的人一定会发觉
the eater would undoubtedly detect it

727
00:45:24,149 --> 00:45:26,320
可能就不会继续吃了
but would probably eat no more.

728
00:45:26,321 --> 00:45:29,477
咖喱恰好可以掩盖这股味道
Curry was exactly the medium

729
00:45:28,076 --> 00:45:30,237
with which to disguise the taste.

730
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,932
所以那一定是Straker或者是他的妻子
So it must have been Straker or his wife?

731
00:45:33,932 --> 00:45:34,935
没错
Exactly.

732
00:45:36,444 --> 00:45:39,645
我想起来你提起过狗
Cause I remember you spoke of a dog.

733
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:49,130
是的 那只晚上没有吠叫的狗
Yes, the dog that didn't bark in the night.

734
00:45:49,756 --> 00:45:52,458
有人走进了马厩
Well someone had been into the stable

735
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,851
并且牵走了马
and taken out the horse

736
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,085
狗却没有叫
and the dog had not barked.

737
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:59,238
所以很明显这个午夜访客 是狗很熟悉的人
So obviously this midnight visitor

738
00:45:57,575 --> 00:45:59,132
was someone the dog knew well.

739
00:45:59,238 --> 00:46:01,607
我本来就不相信会是陌生人
I wasn't really convinced that it was a stranger.

740
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:04,553
但是为了什么他要把马牵出去
But for what purpose

741
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,429
还给自己的马倌下药呢?
should he take out the horse

742
00:46:04,883 --> 00:46:07,852
and drug his own stable boy?

743
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,369
显然他是个大骗子
A dishonest one, obviously.

744
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:15,852
之前就有过驯马师把赌注 下在自己马的败北上
There have been cases before now

745
00:46:11,322 --> 00:46:12,983
where trainers have made great sums of money

746
00:46:13,058 --> 00:46:15,423
by laying against their own horses

747
00:46:15,852 --> 00:46:17,230
然后从中作梗而赚下一大笔
and then preventing them from winning.

748
00:46:17,231 --> 00:46:20,707
有时候故意找个骑术不佳的骑师
Well sometimes you get a poorling jockey,

749
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:26,459
有时候就用更有把握 最狡诈的方式
I will say that.

750
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,791
And sometimes

751
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:28,033
by surer and most subtler means.

752
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:29,616
这把...
This

753
00:46:32,328 --> 00:46:34,496
奇特的刀
singular knife,

754
00:46:34,496 --> 00:46:37,908
是在死者的手上发现的
it was found in the dead man's hand

755
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:42,781
正常人不会用它当作武器 对吧?
and which no sane man

756
00:46:40,522 --> 00:46:43,081
would use as a weapon, right?

757
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:46,594
哦 是的 只有...只有在 最精密的手术里才会使用
Oh yes, only, only used

758
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,681
它那天晚上
in the most delicate operations.

759
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:51,419
是用在了一个很精密的手术上
It was used for a

760
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,296
very delicate operation that night.

761
00:46:54,684 --> 00:46:55,920
不好意思
Excuse me.

762
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:02,237
如你所知 上校
As you know, Colonel,

763
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:07,780
凭你丰富的赛马经验
with your wide knowledge of turf matters

764
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:17,461
在马的后踝骨腱子肉上 从皮下划一小道轻轻的伤口
that it is possible to make a slight nick

765
00:47:11,555 --> 00:47:14,615
in the horse's tendon,

766
00:47:14,693 --> 00:47:19,562
and do it, subcutaneously.

767
00:47:27,797 --> 00:47:31,411
轻微的跛足会被认为是训练过度
Any slight lameness

768
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:31,275
will be put down to a strain in training

769
00:47:31,411 --> 00:47:34,165
或是挫伤 不会被想到是一个肮脏的阴谋
or bruised, never foul play.

770
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:36,952
恶棍 该死的无赖
Villain!

771
00:47:35,249 --> 00:47:37,444
The damn Scoundrel!

772
00:47:36,952 --> 00:47:39,524
手术不能在马厩里进行
Not an operation to be done in the stable.

773
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,749
我不要吃的
No food for me.

774
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,131
马这么敏感的生物
So sensitive a creature

775
00:47:44,132 --> 00:47:46,978
会吵醒熟睡的人
would arouse the soundest of sleepers.

776
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:49,607
我和Gregory都瞎了眼
I've been blind and Gregory too.

777
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:53,262
怪不得他需要蜡烛 还有划过的火柴
Of course, that's why he needed the candle

778
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:54,829
and struck the match.

779
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:56,514
当我检查随身物品时
When I examined Straker's belongings

780
00:47:56,515 --> 00:47:59,320
我非常幸运地不仅发现了...
I was fortunate enough to discover

781
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:01,076
他的犯罪方法
not only the method of the crime

782
00:48:01,076 --> 00:48:03,271
还有犯罪动机
but also the motive.

783
00:48:05,426 --> 00:48:09,879
大部分人不会把别人的账单 放进自己的口袋里
Most men do not carry

784
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,977
other people's bills in their pockets.

785
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,152
从这点我总结出
From this I concluded

786
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:13,983
Straker是过着双重身份的生活
that Straker was leading a double life.

787
00:48:13,984 --> 00:48:15,397
那账单的种类可以看出
The nature of the bill

788
00:48:15,397 --> 00:48:17,715
这个案子里有一个女人
shows that there was a woman in the case.

789
00:48:17,716 --> 00:48:20,875
而且是一个喜欢昂贵东西的女人
And a woman of expensive taste.

790
00:48:20,876 --> 00:48:23,870
尽管你对你的仆人很大方
Liberal though you are with your servants,

791
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,822
我很确定他们也承受不起
I'm sure they're not able to afford

792
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:31,997
花二十二基尼为女人买件衣服
twenty-two guinea, walking dresses for their ladies.

793
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:35,354
照Straker夫人的说法 她从来没有这样的衣服
Mrs. Straker never had one by her own admission.

794
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:39,991
第二天早上我去邦德街
When I visited Bond Street the other morning,

795
00:48:39,992 --> 00:48:44,823
把Straker的照片给Lesurier夫人时
I showed Madame Lesurier

796
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,523
this photograph of Straker.

797
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,500
她认出了他
She recognized him

798
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:56,134
他是一位很好的顾客  叫William Derbyshire
as an extremely good customer

799
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:58,368
called William Derbyshire,

800
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,530
有一位非常时髦的年轻妻子
with a very dashing young wife

801
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,232
她非常偏爱昂贵的裙子
with a partiality for expensive dresses.

802
00:49:03,233 --> 00:49:05,060
女人 女人!
Women!

803
00:49:04,012 --> 00:49:06,071
Women!

804
00:49:06,136 --> 00:49:08,950
我想是她让他负债累累
I suppose it was she

805
00:49:08,951 --> 00:49:12,495
陷入了这般窘境
who plunged him head over heels into debt

806
00:49:09,318 --> 00:49:12,810
and so left him to his miserable plot?

807
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:20,947
Straker把银额马领到低洼地
Straker let out Silver Blaze into the hollow

808
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:26,519
在那里 他的烛光不会被马场的人看见
where his light would not be visible from the yard.

809
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:32,517
Simpson在逃跑中落下了围巾
Simpson in his flight

810
00:49:30,775 --> 00:49:33,209
had dropped his scarf.

811
00:49:33,279 --> 00:49:35,656
Straker捡起了它
Straker picked it up

812
00:49:35,656 --> 00:49:42,005
毫无疑问 他是要用绑住马腿
with the idea, no doubt,

813
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:39,615
that he might use it

814
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,085
in securing the horses leg.

815
00:49:44,768 --> 00:49:47,665
Straker把蜡烛点着了
Straker was able to light his candle

816
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:51,514
但是就在他准备动刀时
but just as he had the knife ready

817
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:57,283
马突然给他的额头来了致命一击
the horse lashed out

818
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:57,193
and caught him a fatal blow on the forehead.

819
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:09,148
为什么
Why?

820
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:11,914
为什么马会突然发起攻击呢?
And why did the horse lash out so suddenly?

821
00:50:11,987 --> 00:50:14,511
是被蜡烛 还是刀吓着了?
Frightened by the candle, the knife?

822
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,686
动物有一种奇怪的本能
Well animals have a strange instinct.

823
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,133
它们似乎知道谁不怀好意
They seem to know

824
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:22,728
when some mischief is intended.

825
00:50:32,234 --> 00:50:35,268
我必须承认 我最后的推测非常大胆
My final shot I must confess, was a long one.

826
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:39,436
我突然想到 像Straker这样精明的人
It struck me that such astute man,

827
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:46,265
在进行马腱手术之前一定做过练习
as Straker would not undertake this

828
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:46,152
tendon-nicking without a little practice.

829
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:54,539
那些羊
The sheep!

830
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:56,196
没错
Of course!

831
00:50:56,197 --> 00:50:58,175
太精彩了 亲爱的
Wonderful, my dear.

832
00:50:59,525 --> 00:51:04,073
现在你只剩下一件事没有解释
Now you've explained

833
00:51:02,008 --> 00:51:04,340
all but one thing.

834
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:07,310
那匹马..马在哪里?
The horse.

835
00:51:06,046 --> 00:51:08,105
Now where was the horse?

836
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:14,594
在这方面我们必须要宽容一点 上校
Well I think we must have

837
00:51:11,718 --> 00:51:16,713
a little amnesty in that direction, Colonel.

838
00:51:16,848 --> 00:51:21,761
它在外面被你其中一位邻居照顾着
It bolted and was looked after

839
00:51:19,961 --> 00:51:22,156
by one of your neighbors.

840
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:37,269
先生们我现在为你们献上一段祝酒词
Gentlemen I give you a toast

841
00:51:37,347 --> 00:51:39,144
献给银额马
to Silver Blaze

842
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:41,775
以我的朋友
coupled with the names of my friends,

843
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:43,820
夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes

844
00:51:43,888 --> 00:51:45,912
和华生医生之名
and Doctor Watson.

845
00:51:53,198 --> 00:51:54,111
敬银额马
To Silver Blaze.

846
00:51:55,715 --> 00:51:58,152
