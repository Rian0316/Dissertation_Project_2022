This is the monastery's account dating to the early 15th Century.

7
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:46,685
哦 跟我想的一样
Oh, precisely what I thought.

8
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:50,114
但无疑这有着巨大的政治意义
But surely this has great political significance.

9
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:53,125
所以格外的棘手
A matter of particular delicacy.

10
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,930
很抱歉打扰你 先生
Sorry to disturb you, sir,

11

靠近火炉 暖和一下

希望你不会在这样一个夜晚

15
00:02:04,093 --> 00:02:06,241
给我们找事做 警督
upon us on such a night as this, inspector.

16
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:08,018
这是我的哥哥 Mycroft

17
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,969
或许你们之前没见过?
Maybe you have not met before?

18
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,334
是的 不然我会有印象的
I'm sure, I would have remembered.

19
00:02:12,412 --> 00:02:15,214
我能跟你握个手吗 先生
May I shake your hand, sir?

20
00:02:16,589 --> 00:02:18,135
可以 如果你坚持的话
Yes, if you must.

21
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:21,815

22

哦 在他的诊所里
Oh, in his surgery.

00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:32,983
我听说 这糟糕的天气
This dreadful weather

29
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:35,560
让他的诊所外排起了长队
has produced a queue into the street I'm told.

30
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,575
他们在浪费时间
Well they're wasting their time.

31
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:39,900
华生用来治疗所有小病的就是
Watson's only cure for any ailment

32
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,864
维他命冲剂和苹果泥
is linus powder and a grated apple.

33
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:45,016
福尔摩斯先生 你知道你那样说只是
Mr. Holmes, you know you only say that

34
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,652
因为你想念医生
because you miss the doctor.

35
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:50,732
雪茄?
Cigar?

36
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:52,195
不 不用了 谢谢
No, no, thank you.

37
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:54,387
一定是什么重要的事
It must be something important

38
00:02:54,461 --> 00:02:55,991
才让你在这暴风天气中出门
to bring you out in such a gale.

39
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:57,379
确实是
It is indeed.

40
00:02:57,455 --> 00:03:00,184
你看过有关Yoxley案件的最新报道吗
Did you see anything of the  Yoxley case in the latest editions?

41
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,393
今天我还没看过晚于15世纪的事情
I see nothing later then the 15th Century today.

42
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,908
我们在研究一本500年前的手稿
We've been studying a 500-year-old palimpsest.

43
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,086
手稿?
Palimpsest?

44
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:09,528
别管什么15世纪了
Enough of the 15th Century,

45
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:12,408
你给我们带来了20世纪的新闻
you bring us news in the 20th.

46
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,409
只是一个短篇报道 但内容齐全
Well it's only a paragraph, and all wrong at that.

47
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:16,716
你应该不会错过什么
So you've not missed anything.

48
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:19,152
听到这个我就放心了 警督
I'm relieved to hear it, inspector.

49
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:21,204
事情发生在Kent
It's down in Kent,

50
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:23,775
距Chatham有7英里远
seven miles from Chatham

51
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,537
离铁路有3英里
and three from the railway line.

52
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,127
我在3:15接到报案
I was wired for at 3:15,

53
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:31,348
在5:00到达Chatham
got to Chatham at 5:00,

54
00:03:31,428 --> 00:03:32,958
并展开调查
conducted my investigation,

55
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:35,391
乘最后一列火车回到Charing Cross
was back at Charing Cross by the last train

56
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:37,937
之后乘出租马车直接来到你这里
and straight to you by cab.

57
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:41,065
那意味着你对你的案子没把握
Which means you're not quite certain of your case.

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,952
那意味着我理不出一点头绪
It means I can make neither head nor tale of it.

59
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:47,779
没有作案动机 福尔摩斯先生
There's no motive, Mr. Holmes.

60
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:49,768
作案动机 警督 什么作案动机?
Motive, Inspector, what motive?

61
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:50,743
一个人死了
A man is dead,

62
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,514
那是毫无疑问的
there's no denying that.

63
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:57,462
但我看不出到底为什么 会有人希望他受到伤害
But I can see no reason between heaven  and earth why anyone should wish him harm.

64
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,229
跟我们讲讲
Tell us about it.

65
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:12,237
几年前
A few years ago

66
00:04:12,274 --> 00:04:14,832
<i>Yoxley旧居被一个老人买了下来</i>
<i>Yoxley Old Place was taken by an elderly man</i>

67
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:17,302
<i>他叫Coram教授</i>

68
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,586
<i>是个残疾人</i>
<i>He's an invalid,</i>

69
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,217
<i>有一半的时间待在床上</i>
<i>keeping his bed half the time</i>

70
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:22,933
<i>而剩下的另一半时间 要么是在房子里拄着拐杖</i>
<i>and the other half-hobbling about the house on a stick</i>

71
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:25,269
<i>要么就坐在轮椅上</i>
<i>or being pushed about the grounds by the gardener</i>

72
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,297
<i>被园丁推着</i>
<i>in a bath chair.</i>

73
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:29,060
-我们到了 -你挺笨的 是不是
-Here we are. -Quite stupid, aren't you.

74
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,879
别着急 小心点
Now just take it easy, be very careful.

75
00:04:35,329 --> 00:04:36,420
小心
Careful.

76
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,659
我的秘书在哪里 Marker夫人
Now where's my secretary, Mrs. Marker?

77
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:51,934
<i>教授正在写一本学术著作</i>
<i>The professor is writing a learned book</i>

78
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,978
<i>在一年前他发现有必要</i>
<i>and found it necessary about a year ago</i>

79
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:55,519
<i>请一个秘书</i>
<i>to take on a secretary,</i>

80
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,613
<i>Willoughby Smith先生</i>
<i>Mr. Willoughby Smith,</i>

81
00:04:57,685 --> 00:05:00,301
<i>一个刚从大学毕业的年轻人</i>
<i>a young man straight from the university.</i>

82
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,933
如果一个人能接受基督一性论的学说
And if one can accept the doctrines of Monophysitism

83
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,376
那么他必然也会重新评价
then perforce one must also re-evaluate

84
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,592
基督教的宗教体系
Christian theology.

85
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,774
建议...
To suggest...

86
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:15,980

建议...

88
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,179
或者争论
Or to argue.

89
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,063
我们当中谁在写这本书
Which one of us is writing this book,

90
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,635
你还是我?
you, or me?

91
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:28,376
当然是您
You are, of course.

92
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:29,844
建议...
To suggest...

93
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,472
<i>刚开始 Smith看起来</i>
<i>From the first it appears that Smith</i>

94
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:33,127
<i>是一个安静的受过良好教育的人</i>
<i>was a quiet, well-educated fellow</i>

95
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,104
<i>并且几乎没有任何缺点</i>
<i>with hardly any weak spot in him at all.</i>

96
00:05:35,174 --> 00:05:37,084
<i>但就是这个年轻人</i>
<i>And yet this is the lad</i>

97
00:05:37,158 --> 00:05:38,546
<i>今天早晨死在了</i>
<i>who met his death this morning</i>

98
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,174
<i>教授的书房里</i>
<i>in the professor's study</i>

99
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:45,086
<i>就目前情况看来只能是谋杀</i>
<i>under circumstances that can point only to murder.</i>

100
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:47,074
谋杀?
Murder?

101
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:50,862
你是不是说Willoughby Smith被谋杀了 警督
Willoughby Smith was murdered you say, Inspector?

102
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,567
请继续
Do go on.

103
00:05:52,648 --> 00:05:54,558
你的热柠檬茶 警督
Your hot lemon drink, inspector.

104
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:56,400
谢谢 Hudson夫人
Thank you Mrs. Hudson,

105
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:58,910
一个在世上没有任何敌人的人
a man without a single enemy in the world.

106
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,262
Hudson夫人 你又在妨碍我们
Mrs. Hudson, you're under foot again.

107
00:06:01,299 --> 00:06:03,464
你说几乎没有任何缺点
When you say hardly any weak spots,

108
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,967
那究竟是什么意思
what exactly do you mean?

109
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:08,720
我们总会有这样那样的陋习
We all have vices of some kind or another.

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,638
Willoughby Smith没有前科
Willoughby Smith has nothing against him,

111
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,110
当他在Uppingham上高中
either as a boy at Uppingham

112
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:15,689
或是之后在剑桥上大学
or later as a young man at Cambridge.

113
00:06:15,762 --> 00:06:17,945
但我了解到他喜欢喝酒
Although I gathered that he was fond of a drink or two.

114
00:06:18,024 --> 00:06:19,483
那并不是件坏事
Well nothing wrong with that.

115
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,501
他也有点好色
He also had a bit of an eye for the ladies.

116
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:22,890
萝卜青菜各有所爱
Each to his own.

117
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,220
也许他隐瞒了一个可怕的秘密
Perhaps he was hiding a terrible secret.

118
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,924
Smith不认识邻里的任何人
Smith knew no one in the neighborhood

119
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:29,295
跟他的雇主过着一样的生活
and lived very much as his employer did.

120
00:06:29,372 --> 00:06:30,902
教授埋首于他的创作
The professor was buried in his work

121
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,218
也没有别的事可做
and existed for nothing else.

122
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:34,550
跟你志趣相投啊 夏洛克
A man after your own heart, Sherlock.

123
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,546
除了你提过的那三个人
Apart from the three people you have mentioned,

124
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,390
房子里还有别的人吗
who else can be found in the house?

125
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,933
一个上了年纪的女管家 Marker夫人
An elderly housekeeper, Mrs. Marker,

126
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:44,567
和一个年轻的女仆 Susan Tarlton
and a young maid, Susan Tarlton.

127
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,470
那谁发现了尸体
So who found the body?

128
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,167
女仆 福尔摩斯先生
The maid, Mr. Holmes.

129
00:06:49,248 --> 00:06:51,208
她说当她听见惨叫时
She said she was working in an upstairs room

130
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,968
她正在楼上的房间里工作
when she heard a cry.

131
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,094
<i>她说当她到达书房时</i>
<i>She said by the time she got to the study</i>

132
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:58,227
<i>Smith躺在了地上 受了致命伤</i>
<i>Smith was lying on the floor fatally wounded.</i>

133
00:06:58,299 --> 00:06:59,889
<i>她说</i>
<i>She says.</i>

134
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:41,475
教授
Professor.

135
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:46,591
教授...教授...
The professor.

136
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:50,440
是她
It was she.

137
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,420
<i>女仆发誓说</i>
<i>The maid is prepared to swear</i>

138
00:08:00,502 --> 00:08:02,935
<i>这是他的原话</i>
<i>that those were his exact words.</i>

139
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,500
教授 是她
The professor, it was she.

140
00:08:10,632 --> 00:08:12,743
我画了一张草图
I've drawn up a rough plan

141
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:16,890
应该会让你对教授书房的位置 有个大体的了解
that should give you a general idea of the position of the professor's study

142
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:22,387
还包括在我看来 这个案件里各种重要的地方
and also the various points of the case which seem to me to be essential.

143
00:08:22,466 --> 00:08:23,342
正如你所见
As you can see

144
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,936
从书房出来有两个走廊
there are two corridors which lead from the study.

145
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:28,972
一个直接通向房子的后门
One goes directly to a door at the back of the house

146
00:08:29,046 --> 00:08:32,557
而另一个通向教授的卧室
and the other straight to the professor's ground floor bedroom.

147
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,037
两个成90度的走廊
Two corridors with a 90-degree angle

148
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:39,517
在书房外会合
joined at one end outside the study.

149
00:08:39,593 --> 00:08:42,441
现在假设凶手进了房子
Now assuming the assassin entered the house,

150
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:43,974
他怎么进来的呢
how did he get in?

151
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,525
毫无疑问从花园的小径和后门走
Undoubtedly by the garden path and the back door,

152
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:49,330
那将直接
which gives direct access

153
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:51,247
经过走廊到达书房
via the corridor to the study.

154
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:52,462
完全正确
Exactly.

155
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,830
而且他必须从同一条路逃走
And he must have made his escape along the same line.

156
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,135
因为书房的其他两个出口
For of the two other exits from the study,

157
00:08:57,172 --> 00:08:58,412
一个被女仆堵住了
one was blocked by the maid

158
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,810
那时她正从楼上下来
as she ran downstairs

159
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:02,319
而另一条直接通向教授的卧室
and the other goes straight to the professor's bedroom.

160
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:06,539
那凶手不能从书房的窗户逃走吗
Could not the assassin have made his escape from the study window?

161
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,664
-被锁上了 先生 从里面 -我明白了
-Locked sir, from within. -I see.

162
00:09:08,702 --> 00:09:10,513
这对于把你的理论付诸实践
It was an excellent opportunity

163
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,615
是个绝佳的机会
to put your theories into practice.

164
00:09:12,696 --> 00:09:16,243
我注意了一下那条
I directed my attention at once to the garden path,

165
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,472
被最近雨水浸洗过的花园小道
which was saturated with recent rain.

166
00:09:19,553 --> 00:09:21,736
小道上没有发现脚印
No footmarks were to be found on the path

167
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:23,547
但毫无疑问
but there could be no question

168
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:28,491
有人沿着草地穿过那里
that someone had passed along the grass border, which lines it.

169
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,885
他这么做
And that he'd done so

170
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:31,871
是为了避免留下足迹
in order to avoid leaving a track.

171
00:09:31,945 --> 00:09:33,819
你在那里发现了脚印?
You found footmarks there?

172
00:09:33,895 --> 00:09:37,015
没有 但那些草被人踩过
Not exactly, but the grass was trodden down

173
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:38,721
那只会是凶手干的
and it could only have been the murderer

174
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:40,427
因为那天早晨包括园丁在内
since neither the gardener nor anyone else

175
00:09:40,508 --> 00:09:42,347
没有人会出现在那个地方
had been in the area that morning

176
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:45,613
而雨是从夜里才开始的
and the rain had only begun during the night.

177
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,568
好极了 警督
Bravo, inspector.

178
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:51,246
我知道你会赞赏我的分析的 福尔摩斯先生
I knew you'd appreciate my reasoning, Mr. Holmes.

179
00:09:54,814 --> 00:09:57,211
那些草上的足迹
These tracks in the grass,

180
00:09:57,286 --> 00:09:58,840
是来的时候留下的 还是走的时候
were they coming or going?

181
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,274
无法判断
It was impossible to say.

182
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,406
根本没有任何轮廓
There was never any outline.

183
00:10:02,995 --> 00:10:07,338
到现在居然还在刮风下雨
Pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since.

184
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:11,688
现在那些足迹将会比手稿更难认了
They'll be harder to read now than the palimpsest.

185
00:10:17,475 --> 00:10:20,076
那么警督 在你确定
So inspector, what did you do

186
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,198
你没有确定任何事情之后
after you made certain

187
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,416
你做了什么呢
that you've made certain of nothing?

188
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,458
说真的 福尔摩斯先生
Well really, Mr. Holmes,

189
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,105
我认为我做得够好了
I think I made certain of a good deal.

190
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:31,640
有人小心地从屋外
Somebody had entered the house

191
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,657
进了房子
cautiously from without.

192
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,792
然后还有那个男的临死前说的话
And then there were the dying man's own words.

193
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,216
最后
And finally,

194
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,094
在他紧握的右手里
there was a very important piece of evidence

195
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:43,719
发现了一个非常重要的证据
found clasped in his right hand.

196
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,005
Willoughby Smith视力很好
Willoughby Smith had excellent sight.

197
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,292
毫无疑问
There can be no question

198
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,967
这个是从凶手的脸上
that these were snatched from the face

199
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,419
夺下来的
or the person of the assassin.

200
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,340
你要找的是个女人
The person you seek is a woman,

201
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:28,195
Mycroft
Mycroft.

202
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:35,193
那可以从眼镜的精致推断出
That can be inferred from their delicacy,

203
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:36,731
当然
and also, of course,

204
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:39,901
也可以从那男人的临终话语推断出
from the last words of the dying man,

205
00:11:39,973 --> 00:11:45,017
镜框用黄金裱得非常漂亮
they're handsomely mounted in solid gold.

206
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:48,561
镜片的度数很高
They are of unusual strength,

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,966
她肯定非常近视
she must have appalling eyesight,

208
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,500
一个因长期用眼
a lady whose vision

209
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:57,227
而视力极度下降的 女人
has been so extremely contracted for any great length of time

210
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:00,013
应该会有以下的
would surely carry physical characteristics

211
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:02,240
相貌特征
of such vision.

212
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,824
有皱纹的前额
Puckered forehead,

213
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:07,814
眼神木纳
peering expression,

214
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:11,401
削肩
rounded shoulders.

215
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:14,810
这副眼镜最近还被修过
They've also recently been repaired.

216
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:20,341
当然 我会计划去伦敦的眼镜商那里转转
Of course, I'd intended to go the round of the London opticians.

217
00:12:20,378 --> 00:12:21,905
早上6点有列从Charing Cross
There's a train from Charing Cross to Chatham

218
00:12:21,987 --> 00:12:23,577
开往Chathamat的火车 福尔摩斯先生
at 6:00 in the morning, Mr. Holmes.

219
00:12:23,658 --> 00:12:25,117
那我得搭那列车
Then I shall take it.

220
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,725
还有更多有关这个案件的情况 要告诉我们吗 警督
Have you anything more to tell us about the case inspector?

221
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,977
我认为你现在了解的跟我一样多
I think you know as much as I do now,

222
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,122
也许更多
perhaps more.

223
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,387
也许
Perhaps,

224
00:12:39,182 --> 00:12:41,367
也许
perhaps.

225
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:45,896
让我感到困惑的
What puzzles me

226
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:48,475
是这个案件里完全没有动机
is the utter want of all object in the crime.

227
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,623
一个男的被残忍地谋杀了 福尔摩斯先生
A man has been cruelly murdered, Mr. Holmes,

228
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,690
但没有人能讲出其中的动机
and not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest.

229
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,644
是谁向当地警察报的警
Who alerted their local police?

230
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:21,395
Mortimer 那个园丁 他是无辜的
Mortimer, the gardener, an innocent.

231
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:22,934
当了解到这个案子
As soon as it became clear

232
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,561
属于苏格兰场管辖
that it was a matter for Scotland Yard,

233
00:13:24,643 --> 00:13:26,826
上面便派我去做调查
the chief constable sent for me.

234
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:51,514
抱歉 先生 那里不能进
Sorry, sir, can't go in there.

235
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:54,018
请这边走
Just walk this way please.

236
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:58,674
没关系 警官 这些人是我带来的
It's all right constable, these gentlemen are with me.

237
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:07,274
除了这个致命的裁纸刀 
Apart from this lethal paper knife

238
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:08,388
和夹鼻眼镜
and the pince-nez,

239
00:14:08,425 --> 00:14:09,714
从昨天早上开始 这个房间里的其他东西
has anything been rearranged

240
00:14:09,751 --> 00:14:11,481
有被重新整理过或是被挪动过吗
or removed in this room since yesterday morning?

241
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,043
没有 福尔摩斯先生 现场和当时一模一样
No, Mr. Holmes. Everything is exactly as it was.

242
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,656
尸体呢
And the body?

243
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,485
尸体倒在这里
The body fell here.

244
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:22,145
伤口在脖子的右侧
The wound was in the right side of the neck,

245
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:25,208
从后面穿到前面
from behind, forwards.

246
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,280
非常好 警督
Excellent inspector,

247
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,634
那这个办公桌?
and this bureau?

248
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,072
教授向我保证没有丢任何东西
The professor assures me that nothing is missing.

249
00:14:33,147 --> 00:14:36,244
我很庆幸没有发生抢劫
I'm satisfied that no robbery has taken place.

250
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,144
你为什么没跟我提到这个划痕 Hopkins
Why did you not tell me about this scratch, Hopkins?

251
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:42,746
当然我注意到了
Well I noticed it of course,

252
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:45,294
但你总能在锁孔周围找到划痕
but you'll always find scratches around a keyhole.

253
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:49,223
看起来很新
It looks recent.

254
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:50,722
非常新
Very recent.

255
00:14:50,796 --> 00:14:52,740
油漆也被划掉了
There's the varnish, too,

256
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:55,741
就像是犁沟两边的泥土
like earth on either side of a furrow.

257
00:14:57,932 --> 00:15:00,505
那很重要吗
Is it significant?

258
00:15:00,576 --> 00:15:03,080
那是父亲的放大镜
That's father's magnifying glass.

259
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,164
是的
Yes.

260
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:06,776
他给你了
He gave it to you?

261
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,836
真够讽刺的 请让一让
How ironic, excuse me.

262
00:15:15,718 --> 00:15:17,343
在Willoughby Smith和凶手之前
Who was the last person to enter this room

263
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,954
谁是最后进这个房间的人
before Willoughby Smith and his murderer?

264
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,274
是我
I was.

265
00:15:20,696 --> 00:15:22,299
Marker夫人
Mrs. Marker.

266
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:23,821
那个女管家
The housekeeper.

267
00:15:23,898 --> 00:15:26,331
是的 请坐
Yes, please sit down.

268
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,524
谢谢 我宁愿站着
Thank you, I prefer to stand.

269
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,498
你也许听说过Sherlock 福尔摩斯先生
You've probably heard of Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

270
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,741
没有
No.

271
00:15:36,117 --> 00:15:38,472
那并不重要
It's really not important.

272
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,384
在Willoughby Smith被谋杀前 你在这个房间待过?
You were in this room before Willoughby Smith was murdered?

273
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,084
大概一刻钟前
About a quarter of an hour before.

274
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:44,857
为什么
Why?

275
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,244
我是女管家 福尔摩斯先生
I am the housekeeper, Mr. Holmes.

276
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,799
我得保持书房尽可能的干净整洁
I try to keep the study as clean and as tidy as possible,

277
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,118
而不是你所注意到的那些不同之处
not that you'd notice the difference.

278
00:15:53,347 --> 00:15:54,806
你是一个人在这里的吗
Were you alone in here?

279
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,195
我是一个人
I was alone.

280
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:59,126
我从不在教授工作的时候到这里来
I never come in here when the professor's at work.

281
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,380
据我所知
As far as I know,

282
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,918
Smith先生当时正在楼上的房间里
Mr. Smith was upstairs in his room at the time.

283
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:04,971
那你根本就没见过他
So you didn't see him at all?

284
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:06,733
直到他...
Not until after he...

285
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,566
他被...
he was...

286
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,310
被...
been...

287
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:16,506
当时我已经把这里打扫完了
I'd finished my housework in here

288
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,905
正在准备教授的午餐
and I was preparing the professor's lunch

289
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,221
这时我听见...
when I heard...

290
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:24,605
当我到达书房时
By the time I reached the study,

291
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,734
Smith先生死了
Mr. Smith was dead.

292
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:33,248
那很明显你错过了他临死前所说的话
Then you were obviously too late to hear his last words?

293
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:35,663
除了那声惨叫我没听见别的东西
I heard nothing except that dreadful cry.

294
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,369
醒醒 警官
Wake up, constable.

295
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,980
那之后你干什么了
What did you do then?

296
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,995
我直接去了教授的房间
I went straight to the professor's room.

297
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,051
他被吓坏了
He was horribly agitated.

298
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,619
那声惨叫让他知道
He'd heard enough to know

299
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,910
有可怕的事情发生了
that something terrible had happened.

300
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:53,143
你今天早晨给这张办公桌掸灰了吗
Did you dust this bureau this morning?

301
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:54,226
是的
I did.

302
00:16:54,298 --> 00:16:56,872
那你注意到锁旁边的擦痕了吗
Did you observe the scratch by the lock?

303
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,260
没有
I did not.

304
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,209
你当然没有了 Marker夫人
Of course you didn't, Mrs. Marker.

305
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:01,910
你的掸子已经把
Your duster would have swept away

306
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,650
那些油漆碎片掸掉了
those scraps of varnish.

307
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,640
钥匙在哪里
And where's the key?

308
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:07,625
教授把它挂在了表链上
The professor keeps it on his watch chain.

309
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:09,951
-不论什么时候? -不论什么时候
-At all times? -At all times.

310
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,115
很好 很好 很好
Good, good, good,

311
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,929
-我们有进展了 -谢谢你 Marker夫人
-we're making progress. -Thank you Mrs. Marker.

312
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:17,519
能麻烦你让女仆到书房来一下吗
Would you be so good as to ask the housemaid to come along to the study?

313
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:19,138
当然 警督
Certainly inspector.

314
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,522
让我们看看
Let us see,

315
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:26,581
这张桌子能告诉我们什么
what this desk reveals.

316
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:32,620
哦 Mycroft 这很有趣
Uh, Mycroft, this is interesting.

317
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:33,936
那是什么
What is it?

318
00:17:34,014 --> 00:17:37,738
Willoughby Smith手写的今天的记录
An entry for today in Willoughby Smith's handwriting.

319
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,156
修道院 7:30
Abbey, 7:30,

320
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,333
真奇怪
how curious.

321
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,810
我想我能为你解释那个 先生
I think I can answer that one for you, sir.

322
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:47,616
Coram教授正在写一本
Professor Coram is writing a book

323
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,771
有关早期基督异教徒的书
about early Christian heretics.

324
00:17:49,853 --> 00:17:51,656
并且这所房子附近
And there are a number of Abbey ruins

325
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:54,330
有一些修道院的废墟
within reasonable traveling distance of the house.

326
00:17:54,412 --> 00:17:58,483
修道院 7:30 为什么是7:30
Abbey, 7:30, why 7:30?

327
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:01,130
Tarlton小姐 请到这里来
Miss Tarlton, please come here.

328
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,847
请坐
Please sit down.

329
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,296
福尔摩斯先生是一位伦敦来的侦探
Mr. Holmes is a detective from London.

330
00:18:15,368 --> 00:18:19,011
你能告诉他 昨天早上的所见所闻吗
Would you tell him everything you saw and heard yesterday morning?

331
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,890
当时十一二点的样子
It was between 11:00 and 12:00.

332
00:18:27,968 --> 00:18:30,116
Coram教授还躺在床上
Professor Coram was still in bed.

333
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:33,816
当天气不好时 他很少在正午前起床
When the weather is poor he seldom rises before midday.

334
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:37,832
Marker夫人正在厨房里忙家务
Mrs. Marker was busy with some work in the kitchen.

335
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:38,800
那么
So.

336
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:57,160
现在你可以看着我
Now you can look at me.

337
00:18:59,018 --> 00:19:02,044
那当时你在哪里
So where were you?

338
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:06,030
那时我正在楼上的一间卧室里挂窗帘
I was hanging some curtains in one of the bedrooms upstairs.

339
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:10,395
Smith先生在他自己的房间里
Mr. Smith had been in his own room.

340
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:13,981
过了一会儿我听见他穿过走廊
At that moment I heard him walk along the passage

341
00:19:14,056 --> 00:19:15,720
下楼去了书房
and descend to the study.

342
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:18,506
你怎么这么肯定 那就是Willoughby Smith
How can you be sure that is was Willoughby Smith?

343
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:24,040
因为他的脚步声很熟悉 先生
Because he had a familiar tread, sir.

344
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:30,649
我没有听见书房的关门声
I didn't hear the study door close.

345
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:34,588
过了一两分钟
About a minute or so later

346
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:38,243
便传来了一声惨叫
there came a dreadful cry.

347
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,432
那是令人毛骨悚然的尖叫
It was a wild horrid scream,

348
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:47,338
那么的奇怪和反常
so strange and unnatural.

349
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,537
无法辨别发出那声音的是男还是女
It could have come either from a man or a woman.

350
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:54,659
我跑下来 去了书房
I ran down to the study.

351
00:19:57,149 --> 00:20:01,013
发现Willoughby躺在了地上
Found Willoughby lying on the floor.

352
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:03,812
我看见了血
Saw the blood,

353
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:06,423
我没有意识到
I didn't realize,

354
00:20:11,004 --> 00:20:13,294
他一定死了
he must be dead.

355
00:20:20,855 --> 00:20:22,357
然后他说话了
And then he spoke.

356
00:20:22,394 --> 00:20:23,957
是她
It was she.

357
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:28,449
教授 是她
Professor, it was she.

358
00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:31,260
是的
Yes.

359
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:33,757
好奇怪的话
Curious words.

360
00:20:35,648 --> 00:20:37,415
你知道这是什么意思吗
Do you know what they mean?

361
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:39,064
不知道 先生
No, sir.

362
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,507
你确定?
Are you sure?

363
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,077
不知道 先生
No, sir.

364
00:20:45,847 --> 00:20:48,200
在你听到惨叫后
Could anyone have left by the rear exit

365
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:52,311
有人从后门离开过吗
after the time you'd heard the scream?

366
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,481
你是说在我下楼前
You mean before I got down the stairs,

367
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,335
那我应该会在走廊看见他
I'd have seen them in the passage.

368
00:20:58,413 --> 00:20:59,837
并且后门从没打开过
And the backdoor never opened

369
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,607
否则我会听见的
or I would have heard it.

370
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:02,967
谢谢你 Tarlton小姐
Thank you, Miss Tarlton,

371
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,860
Mycroft 警督
Mycroft, inspector.

372
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:09,296
或许他是因为跟爱人吵架而被害
Perhaps he was the victim of a lover's quarrel?

373
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,586
那他死得真不值
How very tiresome for the man.

374
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,054
快中午了
It's nearly midday.

375
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,934
教授还待在他的卧室里吗
Will the professor still be in his room?

376
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,550
是的 他从昨天早上开始还没离开过那里
Yes, he hasn't left it since yesterday morning.

377
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:22,689
那你得跟我介绍介绍
Then you must introduce me.

378
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:28,169
怎么了 福尔摩斯先生
What is it, Mr. Holmes?

379
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:30,783
两条走廊都是铺的椰衣垫 (椰子壳纤维编成的垫子)
Both corridors are lined with coconut matting.

380
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:33,917
我注意到了
I've noticed.

381
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:35,429
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

382
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:38,825
这跟案子有什么关系呢
What of it.

383
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:43,206
那似乎对我很有启发性
It seems to me to be suggestive.

384
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,160
不见得吧
Indeed.

385
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,814
请进
Come.

386
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:14,465
关上门 Hopkins
Close the door, Hopkins.

387
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:17,899
寒冷的空气对我的支气管炎没好处
The cold air won't help my bronchial condition.

388
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:23,848
你们其中一个肯定是夏洛克 福尔摩斯
One of you gentlemen must be Sherlock Holmes.

389
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,535
这是我的哥哥 Mycroft
This is my brother, Mycroft.

390
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,083
你抽烟吗 福尔摩斯先生
Are you a smoker, Mr. Holmes?

391
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:35,372
抽烟是我唯一的陋习
I have few other vices.

392
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:40,506
啊 亚历山大烟草
Uh, Alexandrian.

393
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:43,197
-是的 请抽一支 -谢谢
-Yes, Pray take a cigarette. -Thank you.

394
00:22:43,234 --> 00:22:46,452
它们是由lonides为我特别准备的
I have them especially prepared by lonides.

395
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,023
每次给我送来1000支
Sends me 1,000 at a time.

396
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:51,503
我很苦恼不得不每隔两周
I grieve to say that I have to arrange

397
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,018
安排一次新的送货
a fresh supply every fortnight.

398
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,822
你呢 先生
You sir?

399
00:22:56,903 --> 00:23:00,097
不 谢了 不 我更喜欢这个
No, thank you, no, I prefer this.

400
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,485
烟草和工作
Tobacco and my work,

401
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,587
我只剩下这些了
that's all there is left of me,

402
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,125
烟草和工作
tobacco and my work.

403
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:27,676
现在 只有烟草
Now, only tobacco.

404
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:31,813
谁能预见如此可怕的灾难
Who could have foreseen such a terrible catastrophe?

405
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:33,345
我向你保证 福尔摩斯先生
I assure you, Mr. Holmes,

406
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:36,409
在仅仅几个月的训练后
that after, what, just a few months, training,

407
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,329
他就成为了一个非常好的助手
he was an admirable assistant.

408
00:23:39,404 --> 00:23:42,632
对这个案子你有什么看法
What do you think of the matter, hey?

409
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:46,189
我还没有理出头绪来
I have not yet made up my mind.

410
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,454
我会对你很感激的
I would indeed be indebted to you

411
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:53,986
如果你能在黑暗中
if you could throw a light

412
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,004
给我们带来一丝曙光
on all that is dark to us,

413
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,707
对于像我这样一个半瘫痪的可怜的
such a blow, paralyzing to a poor, old bookworm,

414
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,759
病弱的老书呆子也算是一种慰藉
invalid, like myself.

415
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:07,032
你不能继续写你的著作吗 教授
Could you not continue with your work, professor?

416
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,322
哎呀 福尔摩斯先生
Alas Mr. Holmes,

417
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:11,248
我似乎失去了思考的能力
I seem to have lost the faculty of thought.

418
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,384
哦 天哪
Oh dear.

419
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,002
我最伟大的作品
My magnum opus,

420
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:20,022
对在叙利亚和埃及的
my analysis of documents

421
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:21,756
埃及土人的修道院内
found in the Coptic monasteries

422
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:25,837
找到的文件进行分析
of Syria and Egypt.

423
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,692
我希望能够 在现有的宗教基础上深入研究
It is a work that I hoped to have cut deep at the very foundations of revealed religion.

424
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,581
这真令人叹为观止
This looks impressive.

425
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,569
但我的健康每况愈下
But with my enfeebled health,

426
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,011
我不知道
I don't know that I shall

427
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,847
在没有助手的情况下
ever be able to complete it,

428
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,438
还能不能把它写完
without my assistant.

429
00:24:50,868 --> 00:24:53,193
我不想用什么冗长的调查
I don't want to trouble you

430
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:56,506
来打扰你
with a lengthy examination.

431
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,603
简单地说
Simply,

432
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,265
我只想问你 Willoughby Smith的遗言
to ask you what Willoughby Smith

433
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,946
是什么意思
meant by his last words,

434
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,622
"教授 是她"
"The professor, it was she?"

435
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:14,762
Susan
Susan,

436
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:19,050
一个乡村姑娘 福尔摩斯先生
a country girl, Mr. Holmes.

437
00:25:19,088 --> 00:25:21,116
你一定注意到了那个阶级
You must be aware of the incredible stupidity

438
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,988
令人难以置信的愚蠢
of that class.

439
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,936
设想一下 我那可怜的助手 低声说了一些不连贯的话
I fancy the poor fellow murmured some incoherent words

440
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:31,159
而她硬把它们组成毫无意义的信息
and she twisted them into a meaningless message.

441
00:25:36,363 --> 00:25:40,270
对于这场悲剧 你对自己的名字 出现在遗言里就没有任何解释?
You have no explanation yourself for the tragedy?

442
00:25:41,445 --> 00:25:43,117
可能吧
Possibly.

443
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:47,446
下面的话我只想在我们之间说
I breathe this only among ourselves.

444
00:25:48,094 --> 00:25:49,968
可能是自杀
Possibly suicide.

445
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,828
自杀
Suicide.

446
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:56,021
年轻人有他们所不为人知的麻烦 福尔摩斯先生
Young men have their hidden troubles, Mr. Holmes,

447
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,362
或许是感情破裂的问题
an affair of the heart perhaps,

448
00:25:58,571 --> 00:26:01,016
这些是我们不可能知道的
which we will never know.

449
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:05,601
这是一种比谋杀更有可能的假设
It's a more probable supposition than murder.

450
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,591
那夹鼻眼镜又作何解释
And what of the pince-nez?

451
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:14,713
一把扇子 一只手套 一副眼镜
A fan, a glove, eye-glasses

452
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:18,613
谁知道人临死前会带着什么
who knows what article may be carried as a token

453
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:24,850
纪念品或是值钱的东西吧
or treasured when a man puts an end to his life.

454
00:26:24,921 --> 00:26:27,297
我得离开这里了
I must get out of here.

455
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,975
也许我说话像个小孩子
Possibly I speak as a child,

456
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:35,703
但在我看来 Willoughby Smith是自杀的
seems to me Willoughby Smith met his fate by his own hand.

457
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,912
Willoughby Smith是被谋杀的 他没有自杀
Willoughby Smith was murdered. He did not commit suicide.

458
00:26:38,985 --> 00:26:40,266
下午好 先生
Good afternoon, sir.

459
00:26:40,342 --> 00:26:41,552
是的 我同意
Yes, I agree.

460
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,540
那教授所说的对这个案子毫无帮助
So the professor's theory has no bearing on the case.

461
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,426
能麻烦你
Will you be good enough

462
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,793
替我安排马车
to arrange carriage and escort for me

463
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,886
和火车的行程吗
as far as the railway station?

464
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,203
当然 先生
Of course, sir.

465
00:27:03,282 --> 00:27:05,655
我得回去一趟 所以我会带你一起走

00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,590
你真是太好了
You're very kind.

467
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:11,977
我认为你会觉得
I think you might find

468
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:14,414
这比亚历山大烟草
this more beneficial

469
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,687
更有用
than Alexandrian tobacco.

470
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,353
你还记得在我们年轻的时候
Do you remember what papa used to tell us

471
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:23,921
父亲是怎么教导我们的?
when we were young?

472
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:25,725
除去不可能的
Eliminate the impossible

473
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:27,191
不管剩下什么
and whatever remains,

474
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:28,996
也不管剩下的如何不大可能
however improbable,

475
00:27:29,074 --> 00:27:32,033
那一定就是真相
must be the truth.

476
00:27:32,695 --> 00:27:35,490
我忘了他的原话
I forget his exact words

477
00:27:35,526 --> 00:27:37,701
但我说的基本接近
but those are near enough.

478
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,888
回头见
See you in London.

479
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:41,991

480
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:49,218
我没注意到一些事
I'm overlooking something,

481
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,904
但它就在我眼前
and it's staring me in the face.

482
00:27:56,852 --> 00:27:58,739
哦 谢谢你
Oh, thank you my dear.

483
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:03,110
坏消息 先生
Bad news I'm afraid, sir.

484
00:28:03,187 --> 00:28:04,575
直到今天很晚才有
There isn't another train for Charing Cross

485
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:05,965
去Charing Cross的火车
till late this evening.

486
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,810
你应该在把我拽到这里来之前
You should double-check the railway timetable

487
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,105
仔细检查火车时刻表
before dragging me to this wretched place.

488
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:11,809
我知道 先生 抱歉 先生
I know sir and I'm sorry sir.

489

我认为我们应该推迟我们行程

去参加一个政治集会
to attend a political meeting.

493
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:26,587
我们总是听到改革改革
We hear of reform after reform.

494
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,600
我们不该支持这些女性 福尔摩斯先生
We shouldn't encourage these women, Mr. Holmes.

495
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:32,054
她们是闹事者 比罪犯好不到哪儿去
They're troublemakers, no better then criminals.

499
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:43,105

00:28:47,777 --> 00:28:49,272

Do you mind?

503
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:53,094
感谢你们如此的敏锐
Thank you gentlemen for your sensitivity.

504
00:28:53,172 --> 00:28:56,269
我们总是听到改革改革
We hear of reform after reform

505
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,388
但仍然没有采取任何措施
and yet still nothing is done

506
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:01,601
来提高女性的社会地位

仍然只是由男性来决定

509
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,645
而女性
and yet women,

510

在法律上
who are subjected daily and equally

511
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,655
具有同等的地位

00:29:11,727 --> 00:29:14,789
却不允许投票
are not permitted to vote.

513
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:24,180
那一定是Abigail Grosby小姐
That must be Miss Abigail Grosby,

514
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:26,161
真可怕
formidable.

515

女性选举权
Votes for women indeed,

516
00:29:27,947 --> 00:29:29,371
接下来是什么

517
00:29:29,444 --> 00:29:31,141
女警察

518
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,332
女政治家?

我再次警告你
I'm not going to tell you again.

00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:39,811
-至今都是以和平的方式进行 -上帝禁止这些
-has so far beena peaceful one. -God forbid.

522
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,149
时机成熟了 我们必须扪心自问
The time has come and we must ask ourselves

523
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:45,651
这个国家还会像这样持续多久
how much longer the state of affairs can continue?

524
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:48,070
我们还应该忍受
How much longer we should allow ourselves

525
00:29:48,107 --> 00:29:50,495
二等公民的待遇多久
to be treated like second-class citizens?

526
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:52,270
你告诉他们吧 Abigail
You tell them Abigail.

527
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:53,320
扯淡
Poppycock.

528
00:29:53,392 --> 00:29:54,672
我想给你们读一封
I'd like to read you a letter

529
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,960

which I received two days ago

530
00:29:56,037 --> 00:29:57,911
来自Garrett Fawcett夫人的信
from Mrs. Garrett Fawcett,

531
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:00,004
她敦促我们继续斗争
urging us to continue the fight

532
00:30:00,076 --> 00:30:03,050
直到实现目标
until we achieve our aims.

533
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:08,791
那应该会让你感兴趣的 警督
That should interest you, inspector.

534
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:14,515
哦 哦 哦
Well, well, well.

00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,044
Mycroft
Mycroft.

536
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,626
在各个领域
On every side,

537
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,386
那些有能力帮助的人

538
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:35,535
全都装聋作哑
are stricken by deafness.

539
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,860
我们被告知这个国家

540
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:40,243
有比女性选举权更重要的事需要担心
has more important things to worry about than votes for women.

541
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,489
那告诉我
Yet tell me,

542
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:45,788
还有什么比占总人口数一半的人的权利更重要
what can be more important than the rights of half of the population?

543
00:30:45,825 --> 00:30:49,010
已故的的女王不也是个女人吗
Was the late queen not also a woman?

544
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,859
我已经忍了这些犯罪课堂一天了 警督
I have had quite enough of the criminal classes for one day, inspector.

545
00:31:01,896 --> 00:31:04,363
你给我约的那辆马车在哪里
Where's that carriage you promised me?

546
00:31:15,889 --> 00:31:20,360
我真的一无所知 先生
I don't know nothing about nothing, sir, honest.

547
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:24,748
那你干吗哭呢 Tarlton小姐
Then why are you crying Miss Tarlton?

548
00:31:25,394 --> 00:31:28,737
因为我不想惹上麻烦
Cause I don't want to be in no trouble.

549
00:31:28,774 --> 00:31:31,473
否则我会丢了工作
I'll lose my situation if I do.

550
00:31:31,553 --> 00:31:33,048
我再问你一次
I'll ask you one more time,

551
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:35,174
Willoughby Smith是不是认识
was Willoughby Smith acquainted with

552
00:31:35,244 --> 00:31:37,841
那个叫Abigail Grosby的女教师
the schoolteacher Miss Abigail Grosby?

553
00:31:37,924 --> 00:31:39,348
我不知道
I don't know.

554
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,532
你知道的 Tarlton小姐
You do know Miss Tarlton.

555
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:44,568
撒谎是没用的
It's useless to lie.

556
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:48,039
是的 他是认识
Yes, he was.

557
00:31:48,227 --> 00:31:50,935
他们互相认识
They knew each other all right.

558
00:31:50,972 --> 00:31:52,650
他们是情人
They had a blazing row.

559
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:57,081
<i>Abbey 请你听我说</i>
<i>Abbey, will you listen to me please.</i>

560
00:31:57,118 --> 00:31:59,151
前天
Day before yesterday.

561
00:31:59,188 --> 00:32:02,055
<i>你正在为这些选举权 浪费你的时间</i>
<i>You're wasting your time on these suffrages.</i>

562
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:03,576
<i>难道你看不出来吗</i>
<i>Don't you see that?</i>

563
00:32:03,649 --> 00:32:04,541
<i>谢谢 Willoughby</i>

564
00:32:04,577 --> 00:32:07,168
<i>你的支持真是一如既往的势不可挡</i>

565
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,467
他说他爱我

566
00:32:13,394 --> 00:32:15,717
照顾我
Take care of me,

567
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,693
而我相信了他
and I believed him.

568
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:24,911
-别碰我 -Abby Abby Abby
-Don't you touch me. -Abby, Abby, Abby.

569
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:27,663
-别碰我 -好的 好的
-Don't touch me. -All right, all right.

570
00:32:29,058 --> 00:32:32,914
我只是想让你理智一点
I'm just trying to make you see reason.

571
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:35,227
你整天和这些几乎不认识的人在一起
You're spending your time with these people you barely know

572
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:37,060
你应该跟我一起生活
when you should be building a life with me.

573
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:38,592
放手
Take your hands off.

574
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,255
上帝都知道她们中有一半 是最最低劣的
God knows half of them are the lowest of the low.

575
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:43,429
你不该跟这些人混在一起
These are not the sort of people that you should be mixing with.

576
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:44,829
这是我的生活
This is my life.

577
00:32:45,305 --> 00:32:46,635
我要做什么
What I choose to do with it

578
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:49,637
要跟什么人一起做都是我的事情
and who I choose to do it with is my business.

579
00:32:49,674 --> 00:32:51,325
没人能阻止我
No one is going to stand in my way.

580
00:32:51,406 --> 00:32:52,985
我说明白了吗
Do I make myself clear?

581
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:55,509
如果那是你所想要的话
If that's what you want.

582
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,281
我很确切地知道我想要什么
I know exactly what I want

583
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,896
但此时此刻并不包括你
and at the moment it doesn't include you.

584
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,685
是女权解放运动让你这么想的 是不是
That's what emancipation does for a woman, is it?

585
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,154
你喝酒了
You've been drinking.

586
00:33:09,227 --> 00:33:10,580
我告诉过你喝酒后
I've told you not to come near me

587
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:11,822
别靠近我的
when you've been drinking.

588
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,927
它让你拒绝了我的求婚
Makes you turn down a good offer of marriage,

589
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:17,846
一次可以真正快乐的机会
a chance to be really happy

590
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:23,521
却成为了一个不幸的 好卖弄学问的女人
instead of a miserable blue stocking.

591
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,655
你最好离开
You'd better leave.

592
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,486
是空的
It's empty.

593
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:45,035
<i>我认为你会觉得</i>
<i>I think you might find this more beneficial</i>

594
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,992
<i>这比亚历山大烟草更管用</i>
<i>than Alexandrian tobacco.</i>

595
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:09,477
她的视力良好
Nothing wrong with her sight.

596
00:35:11,268 --> 00:35:13,736
Abigail Grosby小姐
Miss Abigail Grosby,

597
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,301
Crosby小姐
Miss Crosby,

598
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:18,860
夏洛克 福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

599
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:22,716
警督无疑已经向你解释了目前的状况
The inspector has no doubt explained state of things to you

600
00:35:24,252 --> 00:35:26,690
那你应该知道你的不利处境
then you know the seriousness of your position.

601
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,447
你有什么要为自己辩护的吗
Do you have anything to say in your defense?

602
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,125
只有那个我被指控的 莫须有的罪名
Only that I am innocent of the crime of which I am accused.

603
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:36,783
但你知道他死了
But you did know the deceased?

604
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,952
那也算是犯罪?
Is that also a crime?

605
00:35:41,308 --> 00:35:46,296
我们曾是很亲密的朋友 直到...
We were close friends until...

606
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:47,865
直到?
Until?

607
00:35:51,612 --> 00:35:54,817
我在他心目中的位置 比他在我心目中的位置要重要的多
I meant more to him than he did to me.

608
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,819
我现在意识到了这一点
I realize that now.

609
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,301
但无论如何
But for all the world

610
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,863
我都不希望他受到伤害
I would not have wished him any harm.

611
00:36:01,776 --> 00:36:03,186
警督告诉我
The inspector informed me

612
00:36:03,223 --> 00:36:05,771
你跟Willoughby Smith
that you had a violent quarrel with Willoughby Smith

613
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:07,782
在他死的前一天吵得很凶
the day before he died?

614
00:36:07,819 --> 00:36:11,080
双方的谈吐都很粗鲁
There were harsh words spoken on both sides,

615
00:36:11,117 --> 00:36:12,822
但有很好的理由
but with good reason.

616
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:17,779
你或许知道我是个 女性选举权运动的积极份子
You probably know that I'm an active member of the women's suffrage movement.

617
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:20,596
Willoughby认为
Willoughby believed, selfishly I think,

618
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,156
我在拿自己未来的生活和自由冒险
that my future way of life

619
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:24,742
但我认为那是他自私的想法
and my liberty were at great risk.

620
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:28,088
我再次向他保证 我们在这里的运动
I reassured him that our campaign here

621
00:36:28,125 --> 00:36:31,668
是尽可能地以和平的方式进行的
was as peaceful as may be.

622
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:37,468
我不想为了改变法律 而违反它
I have no wish to break the law in order to change it,

623
00:36:38,535 --> 00:36:40,230
除非...
unless...

624
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,242
关于你在书房的办公桌
Regarding, your bureau in the study,

625
00:36:43,964 --> 00:36:45,767
那里面有什么东西
does it contain anything

626
00:36:45,844 --> 00:36:48,116
是别人想偷的吗
which someone might wish to steal?

627
00:36:49,117 --> 00:36:51,371
据我所知没有值钱的东西
Nothing of value that I know of,

628
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:54,958
我妻子寄过来的家书
family papers and letters from my poor wife,

629
00:36:55,138 --> 00:36:58,722
值得我骄傲的大学毕业证书
diplomas from universities that have done me honor.

630
00:36:59,943 --> 00:37:02,397
这是钥匙 你可以自己去看
Have the key, you can look for yourself.

631
00:37:17,207 --> 00:37:18,711
鼻烟
Snuff.

632
00:37:32,663 --> 00:37:34,141
你的午餐 教授
Your lunch professor.

633
00:37:43,104 --> 00:37:44,956
不饿吗 福尔摩斯先生
Not hungry, Mr. Holmes?

634
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:49,530
那些香烟可不会提高你的食欲
Those cigarettes don't help your appetite.

635
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,744
无疑出于同样的原因
For the same reason no doubt

636
00:37:53,781 --> 00:37:55,621
教授也没吃多少东西
that the professor returns to the kitchen,

637
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:57,932
而把更多的送回了厨房
more food than he eats.

638
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:18,402
我可以认为
Am I to assume

639
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:20,835
有进一步进展了是吗 警督
there have been further developments, inspector?

640
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:22,403
我是这么被告知的 教授
So I'm told, professor.

641
00:38:22,475 --> 00:38:24,348
很遗憾 福尔摩斯先生
I fail to see, Mr. Holmes,

642
00:38:24,423 --> 00:38:27,129
我无法再给予你进一步的帮助
how I can be of any further assistance to you.

643
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:29,811
我把我所知道的每一个环节
I forged and tested

644
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:33,206
都串起来了 Coram教授
every link of my chain, Professor Coram,

645
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:36,035
并且我肯定这就是真相
and I'm sure that it is sound.

646
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,556
他到底在胡说些什么
What on earth is he talking about?

647
00:38:39,774 --> 00:38:40,908
两天前
Two days ago,

648
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:43,870
一个女人进了你的书房
a woman entered your study.

649
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,824
她来的目的很明确
She came with express intention

650
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:50,756
就是要拿走你办公桌里的某些文件
of taking certain papers, which were held in your bureau.

651
00:38:52,793 --> 00:38:54,769
她有一把自己的钥匙
She had a key of her own.

652
00:39:27,044 --> 00:39:31,686
你自己的钥匙上并没有
Your own key doesn't have that slight discoloration,

653
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:37,438
刮掉油漆后所留下的小斑点
which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced.

654
00:39:37,557 --> 00:39:41,486
这不是在诋毁你
She came, as far as my evidence can tell me,

655
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:43,538
但她来过
without your knowledge,

656
00:39:43,575 --> 00:39:45,983
正如我的证据所显示的那样
to rob you.

657
00:39:50,924 --> 00:39:54,804
既然现在你已经追查出这位女士了
Now surely having traced this lady so far,

658
00:39:55,294 --> 00:39:57,450
那你也能告诉我她后来怎么样了
you can also say what has since become of her?

659
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:59,502
我会尽力那么做的
I shall endeavor to do so.

660
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:03,194
首先 她被你的秘书抓住了
In the first place, she was seized by your secretary.

661
00:40:03,664 --> 00:40:06,584
她为了逃走而刺伤了他
She stabbed him in order to escape.

662
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:08,753
那是个不幸的意外
It was an unhappy accident,

663
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:11,821
但我确信那位女士并无意
but I am convinced that the lady had no intention

664
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,608
想杀害他
of inflicting so grievous an injury.

665
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:18,615
由于被她的所为吓坏了
Horrified by what she had done,

666
00:40:18,652 --> 00:40:21,770
她匆忙地逃离了案发现场
she rushed wildly away from the scene of the tragedy.

667
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:23,568
但不幸的是
Unfortunately for her,

668
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:27,440
她在扭打中丢失了她的夹鼻眼镜
she lost her pince-nez in the scuffle.

669
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:29,659
她跑过走廊
She ran down the corridor,

670
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:32,441
本该是从来的那条路逃走的
which she imagined to be that by which she had come.

671
00:40:32,521 --> 00:40:37,078
但两条走廊铺的都是椰衣垫
Both were lined with coconut matting.

672
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,132
当她发现自己走错了的时候
Only when it was too late,

673
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,610
已经太晚了
did she understand that she had taken the wrong passage

674
00:40:42,685 --> 00:40:47,205
因为她回去的路被切断了
and that her retreat was cut off.

675
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:49,011
她该怎么办
What was she to do?

676
00:40:49,089 --> 00:40:50,477
她不能往回走
She could not go back.

677
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:52,426
她也不能待在走廊里
She could not remain where she was.

678
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:53,854
她必须继续往前走
She must go on.

679
00:40:53,928 --> 00:40:55,980
她继续走
She went on.

680
00:40:59,602 --> 00:41:01,227
非常好 福尔摩斯先生
All very fine, Mr. Holmes.

681
00:41:01,308 --> 00:41:03,906
你是不是想说我躺在床上
Do you want me to say that I could lie in that bed

682
00:41:03,988 --> 00:41:05,304
没有注意到
and not be aware

683
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,529
一个陌生的女人进了我的房间?
that a strange woman had entered my room?

684
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,375
你当然注意到她了 教授
Of course you were aware of her professor.

685
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:13,619
你从这些烟雾中就认出她了
You recognized her through this haze of your existence.

686
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,269
-你跟她讲话了 -你疯了
-You spoke with her. -You're mad.

687
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,663
-你帮助她躲过了警察 -你在说疯话
-You helped her to elude the police. -You're talking insanely.

688
00:41:18,468 --> 00:41:21,404
我帮助她躲过了警察?
I helped her to elude the police?

689
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:25,701
那她现在在哪里
Well where is she now?

690
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:29,710
这里 她一直待的地方
Here, where she has been all along.

691
00:41:37,612 --> 00:41:39,315
你是对的
You are right,

692
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:41,333
你是对的
you're right.

693
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:43,889
我在这里
I am here.

694
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,057
我能听见一切
I could hear everything

695
00:42:03,128 --> 00:42:06,569
我知道你已经了解了真相
and I know that you have learned the truth.

696
00:42:06,643 --> 00:42:09,182
你说那是个意外是对的
But you were right to say it was an accident.

697
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:12,555
我不知道手里拿的是裁纸刀
I did not know it was a knife in my hand.

698
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,399
当时感到绝望的我
For in my despair,

699
00:42:14,477 --> 00:42:17,016
会抓起任何东西
I snatched at anything

700
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:19,949
打晕他 让他放我走
and struck at him to make him let me go.

701
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:27,904
我只剩下一点时间了
I have only a little time here

702
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:32,147
我会让你知道全部的事实
and I would have, that you know the whole truth.

703
00:42:46,849 --> 00:42:51,441
我是这个男人的妻子
That I am this man's wife.

704
00:42:51,513 --> 00:42:53,138
他不是英国人
He's not an Englishman.

705
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:54,951
他是俄国人
He's a Russian.

706
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:56,797
你为什么如此地渴望
Why should you cling so hard

707
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:59,755
你那令人作呕的生活 Sergius
to that retched life of yours, Sergius?

708
00:42:59,832 --> 00:43:02,609
你伤害了太多人
It has done harm to so many

709
00:43:02,687 --> 00:43:04,347
没有人从中受益
and good to none,

710
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:07,548
甚至你自己也没有
not even yourself.

711
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:19,351
当我们在圣彼得堡结婚的时候 你50岁了
You were 50 and I, a young girl,

712
00:43:19,429 --> 00:43:22,003
而我还是个年轻的姑娘
when we married in St. Petersburg.

713
00:43:22,075 --> 00:43:26,004
我那么地爱你
I loved you so much.

714
00:43:26,078 --> 00:43:27,917
比那更甚
More then that,

715
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:30,698
我极度崇拜你
I idolized you.

716
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:36,831
我会为你做任何事 并且我也那样做了
I would have done anything for you, and I did.

717
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:41,514
因为那时你是我的一切
Because then you were everything to me.

718
00:43:43,135 --> 00:43:45,453
但我们是改革家
But we were reformers,

719
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:47,520
虚无主义者
Nihilists,

720
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:50,711
很快大麻烦就来了
and soon there came a time of great trouble.

721
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:15,996
Sergius
Sergius!

722
00:44:17,143 --> 00:44:20,242
Sergius
Sergius!

723
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:30,784
不 Sergius
No, Sergius

724
00:44:30,857 --> 00:44:31,960
不能再有伤亡了
no more deaths

725
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:33,286
不要再有了
no more.

726
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,262
Sergius
Sergius!

727
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,998
Sergius在哪里
Where's Sergius?

728
00:45:32,035 --> 00:45:33,540
忘了你的丈夫吧
Forget your husband.

729
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:35,006
他背叛了我们所有人
He has betrayed us all.

730
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,206
-不 -是的 Anna
-No. -Yes, Anna.

731
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,222
我们被背叛了
We are betrayed.

732
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:43,778
我们因为你的招供全被抓了起来
We were all arrested upon your confession.

733
00:45:43,852 --> 00:45:47,080
我们中的一些人被判处绞刑
Some of us went to the gallows

734
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:50,494
而另外一些被流放到了西伯利亚
and some of us to Siberia.

735
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:54,462
过了20年我才被释放
After 20 years I was released.

736
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:58,396
你带着你那血腥钱来到了英国
You came to England with your blood money

737
00:45:58,472 --> 00:46:01,593
从此过着宁静的生活
and lived in quiet ever since.

738
00:46:01,674 --> 00:46:02,919
据我所知
Knowing well,

739
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:06,154
只要组织一旦找到你在哪里
that if the brotherhood ever found out where you were

740
00:46:06,234 --> 00:46:07,622
不出一个星期
not a week would pass

741
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:11,173
你将会受到公正的裁决
before justice would be done.

742
00:46:11,248 --> 00:46:13,232
我就在你手上 Anna
I'm in your hands, Anna.

743
00:46:17,826 --> 00:46:19,380
你总是对我那么好
You were always good to me.

744
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,075
我的弟弟Alexis
My brother, Alexis,

745
00:46:23,151 --> 00:46:25,821
是个高尚无私的人
was noble, unselfish.

746
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:27,669
他讨厌暴力
He hated violence

747
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:29,337
还写了很多信
and wrote many letters

748
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:31,706
试图劝阻我们不要继续下去
trying to dissuade us from such a course.

749
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:34,881
这些信将会证明他是无辜的
These letters would have proved his innocence

750
00:46:34,952 --> 00:46:39,082
而你把它们从我这里偷走藏起来了
and you stole them from me and hid them.

751
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:41,797
所以Alexis被流放到了西伯利亚
So Alexis was sent to Siberia

752
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,486
至今还被关在那里
where he is even now.

753
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:55,478
我的刑期一满
As soon as my time of imprisonment is over,

754
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,327
我就决定取回
I determined to get the letters

755
00:46:57,404 --> 00:46:59,481
那些能释放我弟弟的信
that would procure my brother's release.

756
00:46:59,562 --> 00:47:03,038
我知道我的丈夫来到了英国
I knew that my husband had come to England

757
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,165
在好几个月的调查后
and after many months of searching

758
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:09,307
我确定了你在哪里
I determined where he was.

759
00:47:13,937 --> 00:47:18,316
所以最后我决定自己取回那些信件
So at last I determined to get the letters for myself.

760
00:47:18,393 --> 00:47:21,585
我才刚刚把它们从办公桌里拿出来
I had just removed them from the bureau

761
00:47:21,666 --> 00:47:25,451
这时那个年轻人抓住了我
when the young man seized me,

762
00:47:25,529 --> 00:47:29,386
那天早上早些时候我还遇到了他
the same young man I had met earlier that morning.

763
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,646
我问他Coram教授住在哪里
I had asked him where Professor Coram lived

764
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,787
但并不知道他就在他手下工作
not knowing that he worked for him.

765
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:37,184
那他也一定跟教授谈到了你
And he must have told the professor about you.

766
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,313
教授 是她
The professor, it was she.

767
00:47:39,383 --> 00:47:41,981
在他倒下后
When he had fallen,

768
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:45,469
我跑了 但我走错了门
I ran but I went to the wrong door

769
00:47:45,544 --> 00:47:49,780
来到了他的房间
and found myself in his room.

770
00:47:49,861 --> 00:47:56,328
你 你说要把我供出去
You, you talked of giving me up.

771
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,917
我告诉过你 如果你那么做

我就把你交给组织

那样我们的生命 就首次在婚后有了羁绊

你的饭菜被送到了这里

781
00:48:38,036 --> 00:48:39,946

你们俩达成协议 当警察离开后

783

她就趁着夜色逃走

784
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:45,792

<i>很明显 从眼镜的度数来看</i>
<i>It was clear to me from the strength of the spectacles</i>

792
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:06,137
<i>如果被弄丢了 其佩带者必定跟瞎了一般</i>

793
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,355
<i>因此我作出了</i>

794
00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:11,532
<i>她仍留在房子里的假设</i>

795

<i>别让我惹上麻烦</i>

<i>但到底为什么 那位令人作呕的女人</i>

801
