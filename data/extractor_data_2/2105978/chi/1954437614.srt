1
00:00:04,404 --> 00:00:07,134
说来真奇怪  人们总是来漫画书店买书
It's amazing people keep coming to comic book stores

2
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:10,204
而不是直接从网上下载电子版的
instead of just downloading comics digitally.

3
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:12,144
这样可能更好
It's probably for the best.

4
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,214
对于很多宅男来说  这里是每周出门的唯一理由
For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here

5
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,284
他们妈妈也好抓紧自己儿子唯一挪窝的时间
is the only chance their mom has to go down

6
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:18,114
冲进房间换上干净的床单
to the basement and change their sheets.

7
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:23,324
这倒提醒我  我今晚有干净的新床单睡了
Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.

8
00:00:25,324 --> 00:00:26,924
怎么样
Well?

9
00:00:26,924 --> 00:00:28,824
感觉新漫画书之夜如何
What do you think of New Comic Book Night?

10
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:31,324
很神奇吧
Magic, huh?

11
00:00:31,534 --> 00:00:33,234
谢尔顿  我其实很失望
Sheldon, I'm disappointed.

12
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,434
作为一个天才
As a brilliant man,

13
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,604
你也算数一数二的人物
you're entitled to a vice.

14
00:00:35,604 --> 00:00:37,304
我能理解你经常逛鸦片窑
I could understand frequenting an opium den

15
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:39,434
或是为了好玩去猎杀你的同伴
or hunting your fellow man for sport.

16
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:44,004
但是看漫画  逊咖
But this? Lame-o.

17
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:48,614
首先  漫画书通过连环画来讲述故事
Well, A) Comic books employ storytelling through sequential art,

18
00:00:48,614 --> 00:00:50,744
这种方式可追溯到一万七千年前
an medium that dates back 17,000 years

19
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:52,614
拉斯科洞穴壁画时代
to the cave paintings of Lascaux,

20
00:00:52,614 --> 00:00:54,954
其次  你还玩竖琴呢
and B) You play the harp.

21
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:56,554
你以为那很酷吗
Like that's cool.

22
00:00:59,724 --> 00:01:02,024
要我帮你找漫画吗
Can I help you find anything?

23
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:04,124
有没有描述一个女人的乳房
A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom

24
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:06,194
不能用来当救生装置的漫画
can't be used as a flotation device.

25
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,664
抱歉  来这里的男生
Sorry. Most of the guys

26
00:01:08,664 --> 00:01:10,904
大部分都喜欢大咪咪
who come in here like big boobs.

27
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,074
有几个自己的咪咪也挺大的
Couple of them have big boobs.

28
00:01:14,444 --> 00:01:17,904
"卡亚战神"出了新的扩展包
The new Warlords of Ka'a expansion pack is out.

29
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:20,044
又出新的  有没有搞错
A new one? Unbelievable.

30
00:01:20,044 --> 00:01:22,344
这帮人老是瞎掰一些新的怪物
They just keep making up more cheesy monsters,

31
00:01:22,344 --> 00:01:25,784
把它们印到卡上  一包卖25块钱
slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop.

32
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,324
这是在暗中让没女人的宅男多掏一份税钱
It's like a secret tax on guys who can't get laid.

33
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:31,494
他们真是太不给力了
They're not even trying.

34
00:01:31,494 --> 00:01:33,624
还记得那个有"地狱大象"的"邪恶撒旦"包吗
Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant?

35
00:01:33,624 --> 00:01:34,994
太扯淡了
Why, absurd.

36
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,464
他算个啥  死了以后下地狱的邪恶大象吗
What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell?

37
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:39,864
一头大象能干出啥坏事
What could an elephant possibly do

38
00:01:39,864 --> 00:01:42,204
死了以后还要被打下地狱
that would cause him eternal damnation?

39
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:43,834
"狂野西部女巫"
"Wild West and Witches"?

40
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:47,034
有哪个白痴会关心
What kind of loser cares about a showdown

41
00:01:47,044 --> 00:01:50,904
比利小子和北方白袍巫师的决战
between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?

42
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,444
只有窝囊废才关心
A total loser.

43
00:01:52,844 --> 00:01:54,474
不就是一个手持六发左轮手枪的小子
Obviously, a guy with a six-shooter

44
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:56,344
打败了一个手持魔杖的老人嘛
beats an old man with a magic wand.

45
00:01:57,984 --> 00:01:59,614
等等
Well, h-hold on.

46
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:02,584
要是那个巫师
Uh, what if the wizard casts

47
00:02:02,584 --> 00:02:05,794
在比利小子的牛仔帽上下了困惑头盔咒呢
a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid's cowboy hat?

48
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:07,254
什么  拜托
What? Please!

49
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:09,094
我们说的可是比利小子
This is Billy the Kid we're talking about.

50
00:02:09,094 --> 00:02:10,964
巫师还没来得及说话呢
I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes

51
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,194
就已经被爆头了
before he could ever get out the words,

52
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,334
比利小子究竟去
"What the hell is Billy the Kid doing

53
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,104
卡亚秘境干嘛
in the mystic realm of Ka'a?"

54
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:18,404
莱纳德
Leonard...

55
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,404
谢尔顿和他朋友艾米是啥关系
What's the deal with Sheldon's friend Amy?

56
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:22,574
他们是一对吗
Are they a couple?

57
00:02:22,674 --> 00:02:24,944
一对怪人倒是真的  怎么了
Couple of weirdos. Why?

58
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,844
你对艾米感兴趣吗
You interested in Amy?

59
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:29,514
我只是觉得她看我的时候
Well, I mean, she didn't look through me

60
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,314
不会觉得我灵魂恶心  胆小如鼠
with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling

61
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:33,884
也不会一脸厌恶和鄙夷
hatred and contempt.

62
00:02:33,884 --> 00:02:35,824
我喜欢这种女人
I like that in a woman.

63
00:02:37,094 --> 00:02:39,494
能否帮我问问谢尔顿  我能不能约她出去玩
Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?

64
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:40,824
当然可以
Sure. I guess.

65
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,224
斯图尔特  帮我们解决下争议
Stuart, settle an argument for us.

66
00:02:43,224 --> 00:02:44,294
谁会赢
Who would win,

67
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,634
比利小子还是白袍巫师
Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?

68
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,604
我要是告诉你们
If I tell you that,

69
00:02:48,604 --> 00:02:51,804
我就剥夺了你们玩这个游戏的快乐
I'm robbing you of the hours of fun you could have

70
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:57,104
现在超低价  只卖24块9毛5哦
for the magical, rootin'-tootin' low price of $24.95.

71
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:59,244
我要一个
I'll take one.

72
00:02:59,244 --> 00:03:00,774
那  要两个吧
Mm... make it two.

73
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:03,484
我恨你们和我自己  要三个
I hate all of you and myself. Three.

74
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,654
我去下单
I'll ring it up.

75
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:09,554
瓮中捉鳖  易如反掌
Like shooting nerds in a barrel.

76
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:14,724

生活大爆炸  第五季第十集

85
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,625
我能跟你谈件事吗
Hey, can I talk to you about something?

86
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,195
有点难开口
It's a little awkward.

87
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,425
我知道你要说什么
I know what this is about.

88
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:45,225
鉴于你事业上的停滞不前
Given the professional standstill you're at,

89
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:47,665
你现在肯定想知道是否应该
you're wondering if this is the appropriate time

90
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:51,235
放弃科研  专攻教育事业
to abandon your research and focus on teaching.

91
00:03:54,775 --> 00:03:56,905
应该
Yes.

92
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,545
而且我建议你
And if I may suggest,

93
00:03:59,545 --> 00:04:01,145
考虑教别的学科
consider changing disciplines.

94
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,415
比如人文学科  就像历史
Yeah, to the humanities-- perhaps history.

95
00:04:03,415 --> 00:04:05,845
教历史的一个好处在于
One of the advantages of teaching history

96
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:08,555
你不用搞创造发明
is that you don't have to create things.

97
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:11,585
你只要记住历史上发生过的事
You know, you just have to remember stuff that happened

98
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:13,495
然后鹦鹉学舌般复述就行
and then parrot it back.

99
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:15,695
你会觉得很开心的
You could have fun with that.

100
00:04:17,065 --> 00:04:18,665
我要说的不是这个
Yeah, that's not it.

101
00:04:18,665 --> 00:04:21,095
斯图尔特对艾米感兴趣
Stuart's kind of interested in Amy.

102
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:23,505
这当然啦  她是非常有趣的人
Oh, of course he is. She's very interesting.

103
00:04:23,505 --> 00:04:25,635
你知道吗  她14岁的时候
Did you know, when she was 14,

104
00:04:25,635 --> 00:04:28,735
自己把脚趾间连着的皮割开了
she severed the webbing between her own toes?

105
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:32,345
不是这个意思
No.

106
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,545
他叫我问问
He wanted me to find out

107
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,745
你介不介意他约艾米出去玩
if you'd have a problem with him asking her out.

108
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:42,515
我不确定该怎么回答  莱纳德
I'm not sure how to respond, Leonard.

109
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,985
艾米又不是我的人
I don't own Amy.

110
00:04:44,995 --> 00:04:47,625
我也不能拥有某个人
Can't own a person.

111
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,365
至少从什么时候开始不能呢
At least not since...

112
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,665
1863年
1863.

113
00:04:58,035 --> 00:05:00,875
因为林肯总统解放了什么呢
President Lincoln freed the...

114
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:04,845
黑奴  拜托  莱纳德
Slaves! Come on, Leonard,

115
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:05,715
如果你要去教历史
if you're going to teach history,

116
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:08,145
你就该知道这些历史事件
these are the kind of facts you'll have to know.

117
00:05:08,445 --> 00:05:10,115
好吧  当我没说
You know what? Never mind.

118
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:12,245
我就让他放心大胆地去约艾米吧
I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.

119
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,555
这问题毫无意义
The question is moot.

120
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,415
斯图尔特这么一个
There is no way that Stuart,

121
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:17,585
穷不啦叽的漫画店老板
an impoverished peddler of picture books,

122
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:20,255
对艾米・菲拉・福勒毫无吸引力可言
would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler,

123
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,365
她可是著名神经生理学家
a noted neurobiologist

124
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:27,335
一氧化二氮有轻微麻醉作用 并致人发笑

125
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,095
只用罐子里的鲜奶油做出的
capable of performing surgery on her own feet

126
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:27,335
一氧化二氮当麻醉剂
with nothing but nitrous oxide

127
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:29,965
就能给自己的脚动手术
from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.

128
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:33,105
好吧  不过强调一下
All right, but for the record,

129
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:36,005
我可是特意征询过你对此事的感受
I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.

130
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:38,505
知道了  我已经如实回答了
Fine. The record shall so reflect.

131
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,215
现在我们回到要紧的问题上
Now, getting back to the problem at hand,

132
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,515
失败的实验物理学家应该怎么办...
what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist...

133
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,655
我没有失败
I am not washed-up.

134
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:50,625
莱纳德
Oh, Leonard.

135
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:53,995
有很多人关心你  想帮助你
Lots of people love you and want to help you,

136
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:57,095
但除非你正视自己的问题  否则都是徒劳
but they can't until you admit the problem.

137
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:02,465
姑娘们  我们喝完了一瓶
Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.

138
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:03,735
我只喝了半杯
I had half a glass.

139
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:06,875
- 我一点都没喝上  -好吧  别怪我
- I didn't have any. - Okay, don't judge me.

140
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,705
你们想玩什么
So, what do you want to do--

141
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,915
看电影  去跳舞  还是去躺一会
go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?

142
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:18,745
或者我们可以玩扭扭乐
Or we play... Travel Twister.

143
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,915
真的吗  艾米  扭扭乐
Amy, really? Twister?

144
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:25,025
拜托  扭扭乐伴我度过了无数个美好的夜晚
Excuse me. I've passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game.

145
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,725
而且我觉得和别人一起玩
And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting

146
00:06:26,725 --> 00:06:28,825
肯定更有趣
when you play with other people.

147
00:06:30,495 --> 00:06:32,765
怎么样  闺蜜  我们分成穿衣队和不穿衣队
What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins.

148
00:06:32,765 --> 00:06:34,235
我是穿衣队  不好意思先挑咯
I'm shirts. Called it.

149
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,275
我太娇小了  不能玩扭扭乐
I'm too small for Twister.

150
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:40,875
过山车也不行
And roller coasters.

151
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,445
坐着的时候脚也够不到地上

就是这打击有点大
"It might be the kick in the pants I need

他不知道你有男朋友了吗
Doesn't he know you have a boyfriend?

170

perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight.

303
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,770
天啊  你是想让艾米吃醋吗
God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?

304
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,040
不是
No.

305
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,040
为何大家这么关心艾米和斯图尔特呢
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?

306
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,280
讨论他们今晚是否会继续喝南瓜拿铁
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes

307
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
或今晚是否会发生关系
or intercourse tonight.

308
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,950
好吧  听我说
Okay, listen to me.

309
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,950
耍把戏是不会帮你把艾米抢回来的
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.

310
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:38,190
我没准备把她抢回来
I am not trying to get her back.

311
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,460
不过  纯属好奇  怎么才能把她抢回来呢
But, out of curiosity, what is a way?

312
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,490
好吧  亲爱的  我给你讲个故事吧
All right, honey, let me tell you a story.

313
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,660
我喜欢过一个男人  但从未对他表白过
There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt.

314
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,830
最终他开始跟别人约会
Eventually, he started going out with someone else,

315
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,830
于是我一直很后悔
and I always regretted it.

316
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,970
你明白我的意思了吗
Do you see where I'm going with this?

317
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,600
我想是的
I believe I do.

318
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,870
我就是你暗恋的那个人
I'm the guy.

319
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,710
不是你
You're not the guy.

320
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,610
你确定吗
Are you sure?

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,480
这就解释了一切
That would explain so much.

322
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,050
你总是赖在我家不走
Your constant presence in my apartment,

323
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,850
你和莱纳德厮混也只是为了靠近我
that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me,

324
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,220
还有你一直叫我"亲爱的"
the way you call me "sweetie" all the time.

325
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,490
我见谁都叫"亲爱的"
I call everyone "sweetie."

326
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,660
你个荡妇
You tramp.

327
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,060
谢尔顿  我的意思是
Look, Sheldon, all I'm saying is

328
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,240
带点种  去找艾米谈谈吧
strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.

329
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,170
带什么
"Strap on a pair"?

330
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,110
系鞋带吗
Of what, skates?

331
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:33,410
亲爱的  绝对不是你
Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.

332
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,220
无聊的话  你可以先走
If you're bored, you can go.

333
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,820
我完全理解
I understand.

334
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,890
不  我看得很开心
No, I'm having a nice time.

335
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,690
别屈尊安慰我了
Don't patronize me.

336
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,630
抱歉  借过
Excuse me. Excuse me.

337
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,700
不好意思
Pardon me.

338
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,330
不好意思  借过
Pardon me. Excuse me.

339
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,330
嗨  斯图尔特
Hi, Stuart.

340
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,170
嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

341
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,070
借过一下  不好意思
Pardon me... Excuse me...

342
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,780
谢尔顿  你来干嘛
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

343
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,580
我只要一想到你跟斯图尔特那厮
The thought of you sitting in a darkened theater

344
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,820
坐在漆黑的影院中  一股厌恶之情就油然而生
with a character like Stuart is repellent.

345
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,020
无意冒犯  斯图尔特
No offense, Stuart.

346
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,590
我没在意
None taken.

347
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,360
虽然"厌恶"这词儿...有点重了
Although "repellent" is kind of a... kind of a strong word.

348
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,500
抱歉让你不快了
I'm sorry this causes you discomfort,

349
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,260
但基于我们关系目前的既定参数
but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship,

350
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,640
只要我乐意  我可以做任何让你厌恶的事情
I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.

351
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,470
我再说一遍...
Um, again...

352
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,680
拜托  斯图尔特  你这样很无礼
Stuart, please. You're being rude.

353
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,380
还有什么话要说吗
Anything else?

354
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,950
我想改变我俩的关系模式
I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.

355
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,490
我洗耳恭听
I'm listening.

356
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,300
基于无论如何都维持原状的共识
With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever,

357
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,160
包括身体或其他方面
physical or otherwise,

358
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,770
我将不会不同意
I would not object to

359
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,400
也不再把你定位为"不是我女朋友"
us no longer characterizing you as "not my girlfriend."

360
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,080
有意思
Interesting.

361
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,150
现在把"不"字去掉再给我说一遍
Now try it without the quadruple negative.

362
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,550
你别得寸进尺
You're being impossible.

363
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,620
嗨  斯图尔特
Hi, Stuart.

364
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,660
好吧
Fine.

365

艾米
Amy...

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,230
你愿意做我女朋友吗
will you be my girlfriend?

367
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,240
-愿意  -好  这样就够了
- Yes.  - Well, that's enough of that.

368
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,580
抱歉打扰你们了
Sorry to interrupt.

369
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,550
祝两位约会愉快
You two enjoy your date.

370

给你一块钱  就当我给你添麻烦了
Here's a dollar for your troubles.

371
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,350
自己去买点酸软糖吃吧
Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.

372
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,220
不好意思  借过一下  抱歉
Excuse me... Excuse me... Pardon me...

373
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:05,030
除了让你和另一个家伙的关系
So, other than you taking your relationship

374
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,070
更近一步之外  今晚还是很美好的
to the next level with another guy, this was nice.

375
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,240
是啊  谢谢送我到家门口
Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.

376

艾米  艾米  艾米
Amy. Amy. Amy.

378
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,110
外面解决好再进门
Let's wrap things up out there.

379
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,750
晚安  斯图尔特

晚安

人家都说晚安了
The lady said "Good night."

383

你怎么进来我家的
How did you get into my apartment?

384
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,670
是不是你成了我女朋友
Is that the kind of nagging I can expect

385
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,330
从今往后我就要听这种唠叨呀
now that you're my girlfriend?

幸好我起草好合同了
