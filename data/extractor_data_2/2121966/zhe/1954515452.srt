1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:03,311
孩子们 我跟你们说过
Kids, have I ever told you

2
00:00:03,313 --> 00:00:05,596
我是如何遇见你们老爸的吗
the story of how I met your father?

3
00:00:05,598 --> 00:00:06,897
我就快进一下
Well, I'll just skip ahead

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,433
快进到我告诉他我怀孕的时候
to the moment I told him I was pregnant.

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,187
怎...怎么啦
W... What happened?

6
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:14,488
我晕过去了吗
Did I pass out?

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,274
不全是
Not exactly.

8
00:00:16,276 --> 00:00:18,409
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:24,448
你确定你不是长胖了
Are you sure you're not just getting fat?

10
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:28,919
哦 对
Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:31,339
这么说 你怀孕了
So, um, you're pregnant.

12
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:32,373
是的
Yeah.

13
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,175
哈
Huh.

14
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:36,544
看来你的咪咪还不知道啊（怀孕后乳房会变大）
Looks like nobody told your boobs.

15
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,332
怎么了
What happened?

16
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:42,633
我昏过去了吗
Did I pass out?

17
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:43,384
噢 我的
Oh, my...

18
00:00:43,386 --> 00:00:44,501
求求你别打我
Please stop hitting me!

19
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,771
嘿
Hey.

20
00:00:46,773 --> 00:00:51,058
你... 你确定你...
Are... Are you sure you're...

21
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,977
没有 不确定
Well, no, not positive.

22
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,395
大姨妈晚了一周了
I'm a week late.

23
00:00:54,397 --> 00:00:56,614
可我从来都不晚 这可是我引以为傲的事
But I'm never late; it's a point of pride with me.

24
00:00:56,616 --> 00:00:57,681
我准备下周一
I'm going to go

25
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,867
去看医生来确认下
see the doctor on Monday to find out for sure.

26
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,070
在那之前 你不许跟任何人讲
Until then, not a word of this to anyone.

27
00:01:03,072 --> 00:01:04,288
连凯文也不说吗
Not even Kevin?

28
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,958
我觉得 孩子可能是他的
I mean, it's probably his.

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,827
我花费了数年的时间
I've spent years training my boys

30
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,212
来训练我的小蝌蚪朝相反的方向游
to swim the other way.

31
00:01:11,214 --> 00:01:13,164
凯文和我还没做过
Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.

32
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:16,533
如果我怀孕了 你是孩子的父亲
If I'm pregnant, you're the dad.

33
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:20,537
那太棒了
That's wonderful!

34
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,722
啥
Huh?

35
00:01:21,724 --> 00:01:23,674
我要当爸爸了
I'm gonna be a daddy!

36
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:29,825

38
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,912

39
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:45,596
一杯加冰的冰茶给孩儿他妈

Stop it.

41
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:47,548
抱歉 抱歉
Sorry, sorry.

42
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,599
我保密
Keeping it secret.

43
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:52,253
不好 我好像把我的给你了
Oop, I think I gave you the wrong one.

44
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,437
来 给我
Here, let me just...

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,389
赶紧把它交给我 放手 
Give it to me. Drop... let go.

46
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:58,726
给哥放手
Take it away from you.

47
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:01,946
巴尼 为什么怀孕这事让你那么高兴
Barney, why are you so happy about this?

48
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:02,947
因为这好极了
Because this is perfect.

49
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:04,315
我想当爸爸
I want to be a dad.

50
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,950
这可不是好消息
This is not good news.

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,235
我有男朋友了
I have a boyfriend.

52
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,153
是啊 如果凯文不在的话 
Yeah, but if Kevin weren't around...

53
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,121
不是这个问题
It doesn't matter!

54
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:12,323
我不想要孩子
I don't want kids.

55
00:02:12,325 --> 00:02:13,541
我从来都不想要孩子
I've never wanted kids,

56
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:17,378
以后也不会 在未来的一百万年里 我也想不要孩子
and never, in a million years, will I ever want kids.

57
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,047
孩子们 对不住哈
Sorry, kids.

58
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:22,383
我不想要孩子
I can't have a baby.

59
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:23,467
嗨  朋友们
Hey, guys!

60
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:27,054
猜猜这是什么
Guess what this is!

61
00:02:27,056 --> 00:02:29,290
你的袜子 靠 你真是个巨人
One of your socks? Boom! You're huge.

62
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:32,459
不 是我还未出生儿子的圣诞袜
No, it's our unborn son's Christmas stocking.

63
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,011
冈德森祖母在我和莉莉结婚的那天
Grandma Gunderson started knitting it

64
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:36,397
就开始织这只袜子了
the day Lily and I got married.

65
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:40,401
可是在她织完之前 她就去世了
She died before she could finish.

66
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:41,435
我真怀念圣诞袜
I miss stockings.

67
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:43,404
我继父克林特让我们扔掉所有的
My stepdad Clint made us get rid of anything

68
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:46,140
能让他觉得圣诞节商业化的东西
that reminds him of the commercialization of Christmas.

69
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,492
我记得你说过他扮成圣诞老人的事儿
I thought you said he dresses up as Santa.

70
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:51,195
是啊 呃 那是为了抗议性别定势
Yeah, but, uh, to protest gender stereotypes,

71
00:02:51,197 --> 00:02:52,580
他扮成了圣诞老娘
he plays Santa as a woman.

72
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:54,198
尽管如此 圣诞老娘还留着大胡子
Though, he keeps the beard.

73
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,535
结果非常令人纠结
The result is disturbing.

74
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:58,836
我们要走了
Well, we should go.

75
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:00,788
我们得去爱婴园
We have to get to We B Babies

76
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,040
为我们的送礼会登记下(为新娘或即将分娩的妇女等举行的送礼会）
so that we can register for our shower.

77
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,325
我去不了
No can do.

78
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:08,429
我还得做个大项目
Um, I have a big project that I'm working on.

79
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:12,383
这是东梅多地区理查德・霍德曼的房子
This is Richard Holdman's house in East Meadow.

80
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,636
去年 他的圣诞装饰
Last year, he had the most visited Christmas display

81
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:16,887
是三州地区最受欢迎的
in the tri-state area.

82
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:18,773
但是 不是今年哟 知道为啥吗
But not this year. You know why?

83
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:21,508
因为大软糖来了
Because Big Fudge has come to town,

84
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,527
而且带来了他的两个朋友
and he brought his two friends:

85
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:26,013
曼宁...斯迪姆柔勒
Mannim... Steamroller.

86
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,014
比赛开始
Game on.

87
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:29,033
你没事儿吧
Are you okay?

88
00:03:29,035 --> 00:03:30,184
没事儿
Yeah.

89
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,453
只是 
Uh, it's just, um...

90
00:03:32,455 --> 00:03:34,572
我讨厌曼宁・斯迪姆柔勒（美国非常受欢迎的圣诞歌曲组合）
I hate Mannheim Steamroller.

91
00:03:34,574 --> 00:03:36,324
就没有别人可以帮你了吗
Isn't there anyone else you can use?

92
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,477
拜托 除了他们 我还能找谁啊
Come on! Who am I gonna use if not the Steamroller?!

93
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,495
我不知道 AC/DC不行么（AC/DC是70年代的摇滚乐队）
I don't know. AC/DC?

94
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:43,347
AC/DC
Ac/dc?

95
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,499
罗宾 你有没有想过
Robin, do you have any idea

96
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,135
他们为什么叫曼宁 斯迪姆柔勒
why they call them Mannheim Steamroller?

97
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:52,390
因为他们牛逼 哄哄 而且那么喜庆
Because they rock... so hard, so festively,

98
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:56,761
以至于你脑子都热得
that steam comes out of your brain.

99
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,479
一边冒烟一边熔化了
As it melts.

100
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:01,215
这么说 我得一个人去爱婴园了
So I have to go to We B Babies by myself?

101
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:03,050
我和罗宾陪你去
Robin and I will go with you.

102
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,738
巴尼 我们来这儿干嘛
Barney, what are we doing here?

103
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,890
我想让你明白养小孩这事儿
I want to show you that having a kid

104
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,442
没什么好怕的
is nothing to be afraid of.

105
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:15,413
孩子们 别闹了
Kids. Stop.

106
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,750
好了 第一项
Okay, first on the registry:

107
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:20,785
咪咪霜
nipple butter.

108
00:04:20,787 --> 00:04:21,735
额哦
Uh-oh.

109
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:22,870
当你给小孩喂奶的时候
As you breast-feed,

110
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:24,738
你的乳头会长长些 大概有10厘米哟
your nipples stretch out, like, four inches

111
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,290
然后变的很干还会开裂
and get all dry and cracked.

112
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,092
乳头霜能遏制出血
The nipple butter stops the bleeding.

113
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:33,097
我十厘米长乳头会开裂而且会流血啊
My four-inch nipples are going to crack and bleed?!

114
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:36,884
对 但是当宝宝在吸你流血的乳头时
Yes, but while the baby is gnawing on your bleeding nips,

115
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:39,753
看看他会穿着什么小衣服哟
look what she'll be wearing.

116
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:47,094
疯狂的杜安
Insane Duane?

117
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,531
巴尼
Barney?

118
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:53,284
疯狂的杜安曾经是你们爸爸最好的朋友
Insane Duane was your father's best friend,

119
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,537
回到他认识我和你泰德叔叔之前
back in the days before he met me or your Uncle Ted.

120
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:59,907
我们准备去她住的地方了
We're going back to her place.

121
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:00,908
嘣
Boom!

122
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,410
好吧 你赢了
All right, you win!

123
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,778
这是二十块钱 是你只用一个字就勾到MM的
Here's 20 for picking up a girl with only one word.

124
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
这是另外的二十块钱 因为那个词是“错误”
And here's another 20 for that word being "Boner."

125
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:08,416
谢谢
Thank you.

126
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:13,120
一个小时以后 我和那个那个谁办完事后就来找你
I'll meet you back here in an hour when I'm done with, uh...

127
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:15,556
额 谁会在乎她的名字是什么 
Ah, who cares what her name is; 

128
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:16,640
她不会待太久 所以名字什么的无所谓啦
she won't be around long enough for it to matter.

129
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,009
好样的
Nice!

130
00:05:21,813 --> 00:05:24,849
嘘
Shh...

131
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,684
我好久都没见到你了
I can't believe I haven't seen you around.

132
00:05:26,686 --> 00:05:29,603
额 我和谢拉很快办完事之后
Well, after Sheila and I had that quickie,

133
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:34,241
我就忙着等孩子们出生 上幼儿园还有拉大便之类的事情了
my life's been playdates, preschools and poops.

134
00:05:34,243 --> 00:05:36,160
我已经有几年都没踏进过酒吧的大门了
I haven't set foot in a bar in years.

135
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:37,828
你不喝酒了吗
You stopped drinking?

136
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,781
哦 我还在喝 
Oh, I still drink.

137
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:44,168
阴道麻木喷雾
Vaginal numbing spray.

138
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,753
显然 生完孩子后
Apparently, after child birth,

139
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:48,372
你的“妹妹”就会变得像拳王洛奇的脸
your hoo-ha looks like Rocky Balboa's face.

140
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:51,425
-你不能生孩子  -我不能生孩子
- You can't have a baby! - I can't have a baby!

141
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,995
第二天 我们去看医生了
The next day, we went to the doctor.

142
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,347
好了 舍巴斯基女士
Well, Mrs. Scherbatsky,

143
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:58,332
我确定你和你的丈夫
I'm sure that you and your husband...

144
00:05:58,334 --> 00:05:59,767
额 他不是我丈夫
Uh, he's not my husband.

145
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:00,718
噢 对不起
Oh, I'm so sorry.

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,835
你的男朋友
Your boyfriend then.

147
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:02,803
他不是我男朋友
He's not my boyfriend.

148
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:03,971
哦 额滴神
Oh, bozhe.

149
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:05,973
好吧   我就直奔主题了
All right, well, I will just cut to the chase.

150
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,024
等一下
Wait! Wait.

151
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,676
好了
All right.

152
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:11,111
好
Okay.

153
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:12,279
好了 我们准备好了 很好
All right, we're ready. Good.

154
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:14,615
你没有怀孕
You are not pregnant.

155
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:16,183
耶
Yeah!

156
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,568
-噢 耶   -耶
- Oh, yeah!   - Yeah!

157
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,520
这就是我想说的
That's what I'm talking about!

158
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,708
耶 你懂的 你懂的
Yeah, you know, you know!

159
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,194
再次对不起 孩子们
Again,sorry kids.

160
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,030
你好 先生
Hey, mister.

161
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:32,082
你要把这些圣诞灯挂起来么
Are you putting up all these Christmas lights?

162
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:34,368
哦 孩子 在我完工后
Oh, kid, by the time I'm done,

163
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,338
你可以从外太空看到这堆东西哟
you're gonna be able to see this son of a bitch from outer space.

164
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,256
哇 不错
Ah, cool.

165
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:41,342
我想把这些灯都挂在房子上
I wanted to put lights on our house,

166
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:44,595
可我爸爸说他太忙了
but my dad says he's too busy with work and stuff.

167
00:06:46,398 --> 00:06:50,818
嘿 你看这样吧 你下个周末
Hey, what do you say, uh, you come back here next weekend

168
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,186
愿意来给我帮忙吗
and help me out?

169
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:53,237
耶
Yeah!

170
00:06:53,239 --> 00:06:55,055
就这么说定啦
You've got yourself a deal.

171
00:06:55,057 --> 00:06:56,390
我是史考特
I'm Scott.

172
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:59,726
我是 艾瑞克森先生
I'm... Mr. Eriksen.

173
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,111
谢谢 埃先生
Thanks, Mr. E.

174
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,783
埃先生
Mr. E.

175
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:08,085
就像一些小流氓刚刚拥有
Looks like some little scamp just earned the right

176
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,120
把维京人队的头盔戴到耶稣婴儿头上的权利一样
to put the Vikings helmet on baby Jesus.

177
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:15,175
那周以后 当我在享受
Later that week, as I was enjoying every second

178
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:16,677
没有怀孕的每一秒的时候
of not being pregnant...

179
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,245
接下来的青少年母亲
Next on Teenage Mommies...

180
00:07:18,247 --> 00:07:20,514
你不是说过你会照顾贝拉吗
But you said you would watch Bella.

181
00:07:20,516 --> 00:07:22,383
我得带啦啦队训练啊
I have cheerleading practice.

182
00:07:23,752 --> 00:07:25,619
你真惨 布雷斯
Sucks to be you, Braces.

183
00:07:26,606 --> 00:07:28,973
哦 额
Oh. Um...

184
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,608
哟呼
Yello!

185
00:07:32,394 --> 00:07:35,062
额 好 我可以回来
Uh, yeah, I can come back in.

186
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:38,365
罗宾 我们上周做了一些检查
Robin, we ran some tests last week.

187
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:42,570
这事有些不太容易接受
This is going to be difficult to hear.

188
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:46,373
然后这医生说了一大堆医学上的东西
And then the doctor said a bunch of medical stuff that...

189
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:49,293
好了 重点是
well, the gist of it was this.

190
00:07:49,295 --> 00:07:51,462
我不能生孩子
I can't have a baby.

191
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,651
是的 你不能生孩子了
No. You can't have a baby.

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,457
呃 太好了
Uh, great.

193
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,279
呃 我的意思是 也没那么好
Uh, well, I mean, um, not-not great.

194
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,363
我的意思是 我从来不想要孩子
I mean, I've never wanted kids,

195
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:10,482
所以要是发生在别人身上的 也没那么好
so if it has to happen to someone...

196
00:08:10,484 --> 00:08:14,236
罗宾 你有可以倾诉这件事的对象吗
Robin, is there anyone you can talk to about this?

197
00:08:14,238 --> 00:08:15,871
也许一个好朋友
Perhaps a close friend?

198
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:18,206
我知道我可以告诉我的朋友们
I knew I could have talked to my friends.

199
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,041
但是 只是我已经知道
But, it's just, I already knew

200
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,127
他们每个人会有什么样的反应了
exactly how they would all react.


201
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,163
泰德会努力让我感觉好点 却会做有点过头
Ted would go into overdrive trying to make me feel better.

202
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:26,548
你得吃点好吃的
You need comfort food.

203
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,900
炸鸡 芝士通心粉 土豆泥
Fried chicken, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes.

204
00:08:28,902 --> 00:08:30,752
开礼物吧 我来帮你揉揉肩
Open your present, I'll work on these shoulders.

205
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:33,121
行了 深呼吸 放轻松 吃炸鸡
Okay, just breathe, relax, eat your chicken.

206
00:08:33,123 --> 00:08:34,840
快点 吃啊 深呼吸
Come on, eat, breathe,

207
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:37,058
快打开 深呼吸 快打开 快点吃
open it, breathe, open it, eat.

208
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,626
罗宾 你为神马会绷得那么紧
Robin, why are you so tense?!

209
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:41,563
莉莉则会彻底崩溃
Lily would just implode.

210
00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:45,800
我居然还一直在谈宝宝的事
And here I've been going on and on about babies.

211
00:08:45,802 --> 00:08:50,071
喔 我真是一个不称职的朋友
Oh, I am such a bad friend!

212
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,775
到头来 还得我去安抚她
And I'd wind up comforting her.

213
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:54,743
安啦安啦
It's okay.

214
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:57,645
你应该朝着我的脸上来一拳
You have to punch me in the face!

215
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,948
马修则会问我一堆一堆的
Marshall would ask me a ton of questions

216
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,499
连我都不知该怎么回答的问题
I don't know the answers to.

217
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,652
-你又没有想过领养 -唔 我还
- Have you thought about adoption? - Um, well...

218
00:09:03,654 --> 00:09:05,337
你家能接受这事吗
Does this kind of thing run in your family?

219
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:06,171
这个…
Uh...

220
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:07,205
你上次来大姨妈的时间 长度
What was the date, duration

221
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,008
还有稳定性如何
and consistency of your last period?

222
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:12,627
然后你的老爹将会鞠躬尽瘁地
And your father would bend over backwards

223
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,095
试着让我笑出来
trying to make me laugh.

224
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:16,497
一个基督教牧师和一个犹太教祭司一起走进了一家酒吧
A priest and a rabbi walk into a bar--

225
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,850
啊不 是理发店 啊不 是家邮局
no, a barbershop-- no, a post office--

226
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:21,386
啊不对不对 是两个牧师 啊还是不对 是两只鸭子
no, it's two priests-- no, it's two ducks--

227
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:23,671
记错了 是一个牧师手里拿着只鸭子 他是波兰人
no, a priest holding a duck-- and he's Polish.

228
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:24,973
是那个牧师 鸭子不是
The priest, not the duck.

229
00:09:24,975 --> 00:09:26,641
实际上 那只鸭子也可以是波兰的哟
Actually, the duck could be Polish, too.

230
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:27,859
这点细节不要紧
Doesn't matter.

231
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:29,694
其实是还有问题的 那个鸭子不是波兰的
Yes it does. The duck's not Polish.

232
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:30,779
要是那样都没有用的话
And when that didn't work,

233
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,948
他也就真的 死而后已 了
he would actually bend over backwards.

234
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,583
平沙落雁
Pratfall!

235
00:09:34,585 --> 00:09:36,134
嗷
Ow!

236
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:39,520
总之 我不想和他们说这事
The bottom line is, I didn't feel like talking about it.

237
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:41,656
所以当泰德问起来的时候
So when Ted asked...

238
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:43,575
嘿 罗宾 你没事吧 你好像不大开心啊
Hey, Robin, you okay? You look upset.

239
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:46,962
我就说了一个在第一时间跳到我脑子里的谎
I just came up with the first lie that popped into my head.

240
00:09:46,964 --> 00:09:48,997
呃 没错
Yeah. Uh...

241
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,633
我刚刚得知我以后再也不能
I just found out I can never...

242
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:55,253
成为加拿大奥运队的撑杆跳选手了
be a pole-vaulter for the Canadian Olympic team.

243
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:57,389
或许是我太高了 或别的原因
I'm too tall or something.

244
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,556
罗宾 真抱歉 真的好可惜 罗宾
Robin, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Robin.

245
00:09:58,558 --> 00:09:59,591
我无语了 这真是太糟了
I had no idea. That's terrible.

246
00:09:59,593 --> 00:10:01,509
能不能给我们这里来份炸鸡啊 伙计
Can we get some fried chicken over here, stat!

247
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:04,596
我这个朋友实在是太不称职了
I am such a bad friend!

248
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,514
三个淫荡的修女出现在了圣彼得
Three slutty nuns show up at St. Peter's--

249
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,816
等等 她们不淫荡的
Wait, wait, they're not slutty.

250
00:10:07,818 --> 00:10:09,567
唔 她们确实很淫荡 我提前剧透了
Well, they are, but you're not supposed to know that yet.

251
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,718
呃…
Um...

252
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,053
嘿 宝贝 怎么了
Hey, baby, what's up?

253
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:14,389
嘿 呃 听着 
Hey, uh, listen, the construction of

254
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:16,024
建造霓虹交响曲的工时
the Symphony of Illumination is taking

255
00:10:16,026 --> 00:10:17,242
要比预想的要长那么一点
a little longer than I thought.

256
00:10:17,244 --> 00:10:19,277
好在我叫了史考特来帮我
Good thing I have Scott here to help me.

257
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,412
对不，史考特
Right, Scott?

258
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:22,080
当然啦 埃先生
You betcha, Mr. E!

259
00:10:22,082 --> 00:10:22,914
坏消息
Bad news.

260
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,949
罗宾因为太高
Robin's too tall

261
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,733
而不能成为奥运会撑杆跳运动员了
to be an Olympic pole-vaulter.

262
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,369
问问她有没有填国际奥委会的上诉表格 
Has she filed an appeal with the IOC?

263
00:10:27,371 --> 00:10:28,837
你有没有填国际奥委会的上诉表格
Have you filed an appeal with the IOC?

264
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,789
问她能不能驼背让自个变矮点
Can she make herself shorter by slouching?

265
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,173
你能不能驼背让自个变矮点
Can you make yourself shorter by slouching?

266
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,458
问她有没有考虑过重新回学校
Has she considered going back to school

267
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,709
然后参加大学组的比赛
and competing at the collegiate level?

268
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,594
你有没有考虑过重新回学校然后 
Have you considered going back to school and...

269
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:38,046
我不想讨论这件事
I don't want to talk about it.

270
00:10:38,048 --> 00:10:39,965
抱歉
Sorry.

271
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,800
爱你呦 亲爱的 明天见了
I love you, baby. See you tomorrow.

272
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:43,301
好的 我也爱你
Okay, I love you, too.

273
00:10:46,256 --> 00:10:47,272
史考特

274
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:48,640
史考特 我的手机刚刚掉下去了
Scott, I dropped my phone.

275
00:10:48,642 --> 00:10:50,108
对 我找着了
Yep, found it.

276
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,393
你能拿上来啊
Could you bring it up here?

277
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:52,694
好嘞
You got it.

278
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:55,196
嘿 我上来的时候 我能给你带瓶啤酒不
Hey, while I'm at it, can I get you a beer?

279
00:10:55,198 --> 00:10:58,616
他想帮老头子带瓶啤酒
He wants to bring the old man a beer.

280
00:10:58,618 --> 00:10:59,734
好啊 当然啦
Yeah, sure.

281
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:01,486
唔 冰箱里有一整箱呢
Uh, there's a whole case in the fridge.

282
00:11:01,488 --> 00:11:02,654
谢了 儿子
Thanks, son.

283
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:05,540
你 你不介意我叫你儿子吧
Do you, do you mind if I call you "Son"?

284
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:07,659
随便你怎么叫我
You can call me whatever you want...

285
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,461
二货
jackass.

286
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:14,449
史考特
Scott?

287
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,917
梯子掉下去了
The ladder fell.

288
00:11:16,752 --> 00:11:19,120
史考特
Scott?

289
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,577
史考特
Scott!

290
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,123
你在干嘛
What are we doing?

291
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:42,477
听着 唔
Listen, um,

292
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,129
我知道这几个星期以来
I know things have been kind of weird

293
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:45,947
我们之间有点怪异
between you and me these past couple weeks,

294
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,332
所以我只想说 
so I just want to say I'm...

295
00:11:47,334 --> 00:11:48,917
很高兴我们又回到了我们开始的地方
I'm glad we're back to where we started.

296
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:50,651
-嗯 -既是朋友又是炮友
- Yeah. - Friends with benefits.

297
00:11:50,653 --> 00:11:51,953
-不 -一直不都是这样的吗
- No. - Just like always.

298
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:53,288
从来没有过 我们只是朋友
Never been that. Just friends.

299
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,173
加炮友 我们可以晚点再说
With benefits. We'll talk about it later.

300
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,209
看看这些小宝宝们啊
Look at all these babies.

301
00:11:58,211 --> 00:12:00,211
你说这事疯不疯狂 因为我们没宝宝了
Isn't it crazy how, now that we're not having one,

302
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:01,679
他们又变得可爱了
babies are cute again?

303
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,049
看那个
Look at that one.

304
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,083
不用了
I'm good.

305
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:06,834
不 我说真的 看 看
No, I'm serious. Look, look.

306
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:08,436
该死
Damn it.

307
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:10,638
他像垃圾一样可爱
That thing's cute as crap.

308
00:12:12,174 --> 00:12:13,808
去屎吧 小宝贝
Screw you, baby.

309
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,312
斯科特
Scott?

310
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:18,513
斯科特
Scott!

311
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:20,532
怎么回事
What is going on?

312
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,233
-嘿 埃先生 -斯科特
-Hey, Mr. E. -Scott...

313
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:24,986
如果你不让我下去 我就要拼命乱叫
if you do not let me down, I am going to scream

314
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:26,871
直到有人来救我
my head off until someone comes to help me,

315
00:12:26,873 --> 00:12:30,208
到时你就要和警察解释这些事了
and then you're going to have to explain all of this to the cops.

316
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,859
到时候你就要解释为什么
And then you'll have to explain why there's

317
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:34,329
你手机上会有我的小香肠的照片
a picture of my ding-dong on your phone.

318
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:35,830
我手机上没有
There is no picture of your...

319
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,216
现在有了哟
There is now.

320
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,218
哦 真是漂亮极了
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty.

321
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,419
斯科特
Scott?

322
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:43,204
斯科特
Scott!

323
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,057
斯科特
Scott!

324
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:47,559
马修一直要我
Marshall keeps

325
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,562
发些我咪咪的照片过去
asking me to text him pictures of my boobies.

326
00:12:50,564 --> 00:12:52,347
过了这么多年
After all these years,

327
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:55,233
有时候他还是像个小青年
he sometimes still acts like a teenager.

328
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:56,734
一会回来
I'll be right back.

329
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:04,826
疯狂的杜安
Insane Duane.

330
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:07,996
现在是正常的杜安了
It's Sane Duane now.

331
00:13:07,998 --> 00:13:10,365
你曾经那么赞啊
You used to be magnificent.

332
00:13:18,457 --> 00:13:20,542
你还好吗
Are you okay?

333
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:24,429
还好 还好 我觉得
Yeah, yeah, um, I guess this, um,

334
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:28,099
撑杆跳这事 最终还是打击到我了
this pole-vaulting thing is finally hitting me.

335
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:29,184
我不明白 罗宾
I don't get it, Robin.

336
00:13:29,186 --> 00:13:31,886
你真的想做撑杆跳选手吗
Did you really want to be a pole-vaulter?

337
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,590
不想 我 呃 我以前
No, no, I was, uh, I was always

338
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:38,026
非常不想拥有
adamantly against having a...

339
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:40,311
呃 撑杆跳生涯
uh, a pole-vaulting career,

340
00:13:40,313 --> 00:13:42,430
虽然这是大部分女人都想要的
even though it's what most women want.

341
00:13:42,432 --> 00:13:44,816
大部分女人想要当撑杆跳选手
Most women want to be a pole-vaulter?

342
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:46,985
在加拿大 在那边很火的
In Canada-- it's very big up there.

343
00:13:46,987 --> 00:13:48,653
你懂的 认识一个不错的男人
You know, it's, it's meet a nice guy,

344
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:51,456
结婚 把杆撑起来
get married, vault some poles,

345
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,891
但我
but I...

346
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:55,460
一直不想那样
never wanted that.

347
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:57,778
当然 不想要是一回事
Of course, it's one thing not to want something.

348
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,131
不能要又是另一回事
It's another to be told you can't have it.

349
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,218
要是有一天你想法变了
I guess it's, it's just nice knowing

350
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,306
想要就能要该多好啊
that you could someday do it if you changed your mind.

351
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:13,678
但是现在 突然间 那个想法就破灭了
But now, all of a sudden, that door is closed.

352
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:19,417
试试一边滑雪一边射击怎么样?
What about the one where you ski and shoot at the same time?

353
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:21,653
你似乎很擅长那个哦
That seems like something you'd be good at.

354
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:25,973
噢天哪 罗宾 看这个
Oh, my God, Robin, look at this.

355
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:27,659
多么可爱的加拿大宝宝衣！
O Cana-dorable!

356
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:28,660
对吧 
Am I right?

357
00:14:28,662 --> 00:14:30,195
对不起
Excuse me.

358
00:14:30,963 --> 00:14:33,665
哇哦 这个真好用
Yep, this works.

359
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:39,593
史考特 
Scott, 

360
00:14:39,594 --> 00:14:40,893
等我下来之后 
when I get down from here, you are going

361
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,312
你就有大麻烦了 小子
to be in big, big trouble, mister.

362
00:14:43,314 --> 00:14:44,680
拜托 埃先生
Come on, Mr. E.

363
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:47,099
你年轻的时候难道没放纵过么
Didn't you ever cut loose when you were a kid?

364
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,518
那是两码事
That's irrelevant.

365
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,937
我是说 我当然放纵过
I mean, of course I did.

366
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:54,156
有一回 我爸妈出城了
One time, when my parents were out of town,

367
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:58,244
我和我兄弟把地窖烧了
my brothers and I set the basement on fire

368
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:01,447
办了个业余摔跤表演赛
hosting an amateur wrestling exhibition.

369
00:15:02,565 --> 00:15:04,917
还有些戏剧效果在里面
There were some theatrics.

370
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,286
看 你懂我的意思
See, you get me.

371
00:15:07,288 --> 00:15:10,456
我不觉得你像某些被我困在屋顶的呆瓜
I don't think of you as some dummy I trapped on the roof.

372
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,627
我觉得你更像 我的父亲
I think of you more like, like my dad.

373
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:20,266
我们的派对能再开半小时么 
Can we keep the party going for 30 more minutes, please?

374
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,887
好吧 斯科特
Okay, Scott.

375
00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:27,556
多谢 哥们
Thanks, Pop.

376
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:33,145
没关系 孩子们只是需要发泄一下
It's fine, kid just needed to blow off some steam.

377
00:15:40,436 --> 00:15:41,453
不
No!

378
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:44,623
那可是冈德森奶奶织的
Grandma Gunderson knitted that!

379
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:48,244
史考特
Scott...!

380
00:15:48,246 --> 00:15:49,628
这太疯狂了
That was crazy.

381
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,964
她哭着跑出去了
She just ran out of there crying.

382
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:53,465
现在连电话也不接
Now she's not answering her phone.

383
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:56,418
这几周她真的很奇怪
She's been acting really weird for a few weeks now,

384
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,422
从我们讨论飓风那天晚上开始
really since the night we discussed the hurricane.

385
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:01,790
巴尼 你们一起搭车回家的
Barney, you split a cab home.

386
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:03,342
她说了些什么吗
Did she say anything?

387
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,297
我们没怎么聊
We didn't really talk much.

388
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:09,398
好吧 幸运的是
Well, lucky for us,

389
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,318
这里有人非常擅长
someone at this table is skilled

390
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,070
侦查的艺术哟
in the art of detection.

391
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,489
罗宾不开心
Robin's upset.

392
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:20,326
她和凯文有问题了
She and Kevin are having trouble.

393
00:16:20,328 --> 00:16:22,144
-他背叛了她  -不可能
- He cheated on her. -No way.

394
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,831
凯文是个诚实正派的人 他没那么幸运
Kevin's an honest, decent guy who never on his best day

395
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,816
可以勾搭上一个比罗宾更辣的美女
could pull a hotter chick than Robin.

396
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,668
那也许是罗宾背叛了他
Maybe Robin cheated on him.

397
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,488
也许罗宾才是跟别人上床的贱人
Maybe Robin is the dirty bird who slept with someone else.

398
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,758
我不知道 撑杆跳这事
I don't know, this pole-vaulting thing seems

399
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,659
感觉有点像灌篮啊
like a slam dunk to me.

400
00:16:37,661 --> 00:16:39,595
噢 这太明显了
Oh, it is so obvious.

401
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:40,930
巴尼
Barney.

402
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:43,015
那个跟你一起工作的人
What is the name of that guy

403
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,683
叫什么名字 呃  兰迪 
you worked with-- uh, Randy?

404
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:45,884
原来是跟兰迪
It was Randy.

405
00:16:45,886 --> 00:16:46,852
等一下
Wait a second.

406
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:49,021
我已经破了这个案子了
I just cracked this case.

407
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:51,673
就是那个枫叶婴儿服
The little maple leaf onesie.

408
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,609
让她想家了
It made her homesick.

409
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:54,560
那到底是什么让她不开心呢
That's why she's so upset.

410
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:55,644
她不准备回家过圣诞
She's not going home for Christmas.

411
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,147
难道她想让我邀请她去我老家吗
She wants me to invite her to Ohio.

412
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,015
肯定是因为这个
That's got to be it!

413
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:02,067
或者是她又跟巴尼一起滚床单了
Either that or she slept with Barney.

414
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:17,800
噢 你肯定是史考特
Oh, you must be Scott.

415
00:17:17,802 --> 00:17:20,219
喔 你好 太太
Oh, hello, ma'am.

416
00:17:20,221 --> 00:17:22,554
见到您真荣幸
It's nice to finally see your face.

417
00:17:22,556 --> 00:17:25,057
那么 我最好去啃书本了
Well, I'd better go hit those books.

418
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,543
年轻人 等一下
Hold it right there, young man.

419
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:32,147
这是一点心意 谢谢你帮了我老公
This is for helping out my husband.

420
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:35,651
哇噢 五十刀
Wow, 50 bucks.

421
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:36,819
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

422
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:48,414
莉莉
Lily!

423
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,616
一张去克利夫兰的机票吗
An airplane ticket to Cleveland?

424
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,618
我知道这不是加拿大 但也相差不了多少(注:克利夫兰和加拿大首字母均为C)
I know it's not Canada, but it starts with a "C"

425
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,037
而且冷得都能缩成球了 赶紧打包吧
and it's cold as balls, so get packed.

426
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,755
你跟我一起回家过圣诞吧
You're coming home with me for Christmas.

427
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,507
老兄 想得美
Yeah, nice try, dude.

428
00:17:58,509 --> 00:17:59,541
我可不会去六年来付了一亿二千五百万工资
I wouldn't go to Cleveland

429
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:03,245
给某人的克利夫兰
for $125 million paid over six years.

430
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:04,263
还继续啊
Still?

431
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,848
还要笑勒布朗吗（NBA球星 为拿总冠军离开克利夫兰队结果未能如愿 )
Still with the LeBron jokes?

432
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,099
那总冠军戒指到底在哪 啊
Where's that ring, huh?

433
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:09,101
那个本该拥有的戒指现在在哪
Where's that ring he's supposed to have by now?

434
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,753
听着 我只是 我觉得你不开心
Look, I just-- I thought you were bummed

435
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:13,305
因为你不能回家过圣诞
about not going home for Christmas.

436
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,423
你在开玩笑么
Are you kidding?

437
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,775
我喜欢在纽约过圣诞
I love New York at Christmas.

438
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,111
这里安静又祥和
It's so quiet and peaceful.

439
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,614
还有鸡蛋酒陪着我 所以
Got my eggnog to keep me company, so...

440
00:18:22,616 --> 00:18:24,900
罗宾 怎么了
Robin, what's wrong?

441
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:26,952
没事 跟我说说吧
- Nothing. - Just tell me.

442
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:28,570
你怎么非想要知道啊
Why do you need to know so bad?

443
00:18:28,572 --> 00:18:29,738
这样我好让你开心起来
So I can cheer you up.

444
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,273
让我开心这并不是你的工作
It's not your job to cheer me up.

445
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,241
是的 一直都是
Yes, it is.

446
00:18:32,243 --> 00:18:34,326
让你开心是我的职责所在
Cheering you up is my job.

447
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:36,161
好吧 那你被炒了
Well, then, you're fired.

448
00:18:36,163 --> 00:18:37,162
你不能开除我
You can't fire me.

449
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:38,447
我是工会的 贱人
I'm union, bitch.

450
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:39,915
这不是你该做的事
It's not your job to cheer me up.

451
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:40,966
-是的 本来就是   -这不是
- Yes, it is.   - No, it's not.

452
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:41,884
一直都是
Yes, it is.

453
00:18:41,886 --> 00:18:43,452
一直都不是
No, it's not.

454
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,789
圣诞快乐 泰德
Merry Christmas, Ted.

455
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,843
圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas.

456
00:18:53,396 --> 00:18:57,766
就这样 孩子们 最后我独自一人过了圣诞节
So, kids, I settled in for a Christmas alone.

457
00:18:57,768 --> 00:19:00,569
我十分感激 泰德想要让我开心起来
I appreciated that Ted wanted to cheer me up,

458
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:03,472
不过说实话 其实没有必要
but honestly, it wasn't necessary.

459
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:05,441
所以我不能有自己的孩子
So I can't have kids.

460
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,192
非常大的代价
Big deal.

461
00:19:07,194 --> 00:19:09,611
在这一刻 没有人能把我拉回生活的原路上去
This way there's no one to hold me back in life,

462
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,246
没有一个人能把我从游荡的途中拉回来
no one to keep me from traveling

463
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:12,647
当那时的我只想在街头游荡
where I want to travel,

464
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:14,500
没人能在我的职业生涯上碍事
no one getting in the way of my career.

465
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:17,319
如果你们想要知道真相的话
If you want to know the truth of it,

466
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:20,155
我很感激的是 你们并不是真实的
I'm glad you guys aren't real.

467
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,171
非常感激
Really glad.

468
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:55,374
靠
Damn it.

469
00:20:08,805 --> 00:20:11,706
是的 这是我的工作
Yes, it is.

470
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,928
听着 如果你不想告诉我哪里出了岔子 也行
Look, you don't want to tell me what's wrong, fine.

471
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,229
我也没必要知道
I don't need to know.

472
00:20:18,331 --> 00:20:21,049
但你不能阻止我逗你开心
But you can never stop me from trying to cheer you up.

473
00:20:22,018 --> 00:20:23,101
这就是生活
It's a fact of life.

474
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,487
你只能学着去接受它
You're just gonna have to deal with it.

475
00:20:25,489 --> 00:20:26,555
泰德
Ted...

476
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:28,440
等等 这可是最精彩的地方
Hold on, hold on, this is the best part.

477
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:39,440
我在通往地狱的高速公路上
I'm on the highway to hell
 
478
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,343
孩子们 罗宾阿姨没能成为一个撑竿跳选手
Kids, your Aunt Robin never became a pole-vaulter,

479
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,343
但是她却成为了一个有名的记者
but she did become a famous journalist,

480
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:51,563
一个成功的生意人 以及一个周游世界的旅行者
a successful businesswoman, a world traveler.

481
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,182
她还当过一阵子的斗牛士
She was even briefly a bullfighter--

482
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,750
这是个有趣的故事 以后我会慢慢讲给你们听
that's a funny story, I'll get to that one later.

483
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:59,721
但是有一样东西 你们的罗宾阿姨从来没有缺少过
But there's one thing your Aunt Robin never was.

484
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:00,755
她从来就不是一个人
She was never alone.

485
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,810
