1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,189
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,689
This town was my home. I want it back.

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,979
All of your scheming, the enemies that you have made

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,209
every single day of your miserable life,

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,539
what results did you expect,

6
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,940
that your child would be born into a happy life?

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,039
This was our family's hope.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,929
We need to regain control of the city.

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,129
I'm fighting for my home,

10
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,429
for the dignity of the vampires who were run out of there.

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,529
The offer still exists to join me.

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,199
You brought me back to kill my son.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,929
When I'm ready, not a minute before.

14
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,779
We should have known our mother would not be bound

15
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,589
by anything as obvious as death.

16
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,890
- We have much to do. - Yes, mother.

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm Kaleb.

18
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,659
Finn, Kol, we have a family reunion to plan.

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,640
What is it that you intend to do, brother?

20
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,050
Whatever it takes to save our family.

21
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,000
Kol?

22
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,880
All of my efforts to keep this family concealed,

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,059
and yet debauchery like this

24
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,729
has led father directly to us.

25
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,900
Kol, show yourself.

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,270
This is no time for games.

27
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,960
Come, come, brother.

28
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,840
There's always time for games.

29
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,710
We must leave.

30
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,749
Mikael is very nearly upon us.

31
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,219
If Mikael were upon us,

32
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,199
I imagine Niklaus would be quite dead.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,599
I barely escaped.

34
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,229
Father left the head of my horse

35
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,410
on a pike in the town square.

36
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,140
He killed poor Theo?

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,670
What a beast...

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,960
But then, father has always hated you most.

39
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,380
Surely, he'll chase you if you flee, leaving me here.

40
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,400
Perhaps I'll make myself mayor.

41
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,549
Rebekah and Finn have already gone to the ship.

42
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,269
It is imperative we remain together.

43
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,529
Rebekah does what she's told

44
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,040
because she fears Nik,

45
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:08,419
and Finn is in no position to argue,

46
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,160
given the dagger in his heart.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,230
I'll take my chances here.

48
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,550
I find it amusing that you think you have a choice.

49
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,870
No. I swear to you, the day will come

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,659
when I'm not so easily subdued,

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,420
and on that day, I will make you suffer.

52
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,540
Perhaps, but today is not that day.

00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:12,793

THE ORIGINALS
Season 02 - Episodie 02
“Alive and Kicking”

55
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,410
Come to check up on me?

56
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,959
You've had an eventful evening.

57
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,189
I was having a crappy day.

58
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,180
so Klaus took me out to the cauldron.

59
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,540
Wouldn't you know, we ran into some witches.

60
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,020
So would you like me to remove your leftovers?

61
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,080
Oh, don't judge, Elijah.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,760
What I did is no worse than anything Klaus has ever done.

63
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,930
I would hope that you would hold yourself

64
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,059
to a higher standard than Niklaus.

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,370
I'm a hybrid now.

66
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,320
I have a werewolf temper to go with my new appetite,

67
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,969
and the witches that tried to kill my baby,

68
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,910
they're worth nothing more than food.

69
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,420
Excuse me.

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,600
You took her on a witch hunt?

71
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,879
I simply wanted to persuade those witches

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,439
to locate the white oak stake for me.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,510
When they proved unable to do so,

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,719
I let Hayley have her fun.

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,269
She grows more savage by the day.

76
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,929
Can you not see that she is falling apart?

77
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,000
Perhaps the problem is your high standards.

78
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,110
Hayley is one of us now.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,119
Being a vampire only exaggerates

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,310
what you truly are, and wolves are wild things.

81
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,609
She knows she can never live up to the pretty,

82
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,239
little picture you paint of her in your head.

83
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,189
Your judgment only hurts her more.

84
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,970
I am trying to help her,

85
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,880
and I asked you to help her, brother.

86
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,220
I am helping.

87
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,809
You should have seen her last night

88
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,480
covered in witches' blood and smiling from ear to ear.

89
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,800
She is embracing this, and less criticism from you,

90
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,669
and Hayley'll be just fine.

91
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,509
Niklaus, the mother of your child

92
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,710
deserves much better than just fine.

93
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,380
You'll take her to the bayou.

94
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,840
Find any remaining wolves.

95
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,550
Perhaps her people can reach her.

96
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,179
Now more than ever, she needs a connection

97
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:55,710
to some of her humanity, some degree of dignity.

98
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,959
Gia has proven herself.

99
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,099
She knows what she's getting into.

100
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,989
So she's gonna be the first one that I turn.

101
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,739
Everybody else, first, I need to be sure

102
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,490
that you can handle moving up a notch on the food chain,

103
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,699
the emotional ups and downs, solitude, and bloodlust.

104
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,860
Imagine hearing the sound of a heart beating,

105
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,960
beating, beating

106
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,680
and wanting more than anything to feed.

107
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,080
That's what it's like to be a vampire.

108
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,830
It's not for everybody.

109
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,709
Some folks, well,

110
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,930
let's just say, it brings out the worst in them.

111
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,399
I can't do it.

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,380
You once said the same thing of your reading.

113
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,299
Now you devour everything

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,449
from sonnets to scripture.

115
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,780
So devote yourself to your music,

116
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,020
soon you shall be Johann Sebastian Bach.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,590
But I want to play like you.

118
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,689
Well, isn't this nice-- my older brother

119
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,990
and my ward getting along like two peas in a pod.

120
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,849
We shall continue another time.

121
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,279
Why don't you resume your "Hamlet"?

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,410
Act one, Scene 3 today. Off you go.

123
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,380
Congratulations. You've been drinking.

124
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,379
Only to remedy the lifeless monotony

125
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,650
that has overcome this household.

126
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,309
You know, Rebekah is still pouting

127
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,000
over the Governor's son.

128
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,669
When you threw him to his death,

129
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,299
did you imagine a different outcome?

130
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,090
You monopolize young Marcellus

131
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,830
with schooling.

132
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,010
He and I used to have such fun.

133
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,260
If only there was someone with whom

134
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,690
I could share a bit of roguery.

135
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,530
Ah, yes. That's right.

136
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,460
There is.

137
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,020
You didn't.

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
Mm, bravo.

139
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,760
That was delectable,

140
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,930
but make no mistake, Nik.

141
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,160
I'm still cross that you daggered me,

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,590
but as far as apologies go,

143
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,000
it's a start.

144
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,610
So this is your idea of fun?

145
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,300
Well, you and Marcellus have grown thick as thieves.

146
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,140
Why should I be alone?

147
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:40,449
Elijah, didn't expect to see you on this side of the river.

148
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,250
Didn't expect to see you assemble a new vampire community.

149
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,500
I guess we're both full of surprises.

150
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,769
My community was fine until Klaus

151
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:50,380
had the brilliant idea to make moonlight rings.

152
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,490
Now that harvest girl is making more,

153
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,939
offering them to the wolves in exchange for their allegiance,

154
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,980
and the wolves are just kneeling at her feet.

155
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,039
The quarter has become a dangerous place,

156
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,570
and you, you're the last true vampire left.

157
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,730
If you ask me, you're better off joining my community.

158
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,270
Maybe that's why you're here.

159
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,880
I came to make you an offer.

160
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,800
Find me the white oak stake,

161
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,140
and I'll let this little social experiment continue.

162
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,689
Oh, even if I wanted to help,

163
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,360
I don't have a clue where the stake is.

164
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,489
Yes, but you do have an ally in Davina.

165
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,860
She can find it.

166
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,489
Thing is, I'd speak to her myself,

167
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:28,520
but I feel the conversation might become a little unpleasant.

168
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,799
You don't go anywhere near her.

169
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,060
Then it's settled.

170
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,790
You'll deal with the matter personally.

171
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,830
How frustrating,

172
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,010
A novice trying to interpret the work of a master.

173
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,770
It's a simple delinking spell.

174
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,700
Simple?

175
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,849
You're trying to erase the link between Klaus

176
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,090
and every single vampire he's sired.

177
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,339
No. All I care about is Marcel and Josh.

178
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,059
You kill Klaus, they die, too.

179
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,209
I can fix that.

180
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,219
I have Esther's grimoire.

181
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,599
It's just a matter of time.

182
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,190
Perhaps I can help you solve the riddle.

183
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,859
Unless you trick me into a spell

184
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,900
that will free you from my control.

185
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,829
For someone who despises Klaus so much,

186
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,929
you certainly share his paranoia.

187
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,709
The sooner you perform the spell,

188
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,590
the sooner I'll be free to kill the bastard.

189
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,780
Well, you were right to be suspicious.

190
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,729
Davina is hiding something in that attic.

191
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,659
The door was locked with a rather complex spell.

192
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,469
Could be a weapon, source of power.

193
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,529
I prefer not to leave anything to chance.

194
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,570
Better we know what she has and whose side she's on.

195
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,929
So you'll take her to dinner.

196
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,590
I just stood her up for coffee.

197
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,369
Oh, she probably hates me by now.

198
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,359
Just do as you're told, Kol.

199
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,379
Of course. Finn the sycophant speaks up.

200
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,720
You gonna grovel at your mother's heels for eternity, or what?

201
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
Stop it, both of you.

202
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,560
There's enough conflict to come.

203
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,150
Look at this pack of freeloaders.

204
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,360
Nonsense.

205
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,199
These are our friends, wolves in need of a gift

206
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,550
only I can provide-- moonlight rings.

207
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,320
The witches have been working day and night.

208
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,880
Soon, we will have enough rings for an army,

209
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,570
And when we do,

210
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,140
we will pay your brothers a visit.

211
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,540
We'll teach them the unfortunate error

212
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,400
of their vampire ways.

213
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,599
I told you this place was deserted.

214
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,830
No. Their scent is fresh.

215
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,050
They're hiding,

216
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,679
Which means somewhere nearby,

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,849
we will find the remnants of your pack.

218
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,110
And then what?

219
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,930
It's not that they're exactly gonna welcome us.

220
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,129
If there's one thing these people hate

221
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,209
more than vampires, it's hybrids.

222
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,570
What they hate is their lack of power,

223
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,889
hence the willingness of their brethren

224
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,430
to deal with that witch in exchange for rings.

225
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,799
But she hasn't gotten to your lot yet.

226
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,680
So we need to get to them first

227
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,670
and ensure they align with us.

228
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,090
Awesome.

229
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,109
All we got to do is find them.

230
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,190
A task I leave to you. Well, go on.

231
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,539
You're a hybrid now with heightened senses

232
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,570
unlike anything under the sun besides me.

233
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,079
This is stupid.

234
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,030
Your people need a leader.

235
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,760
You are their queen.

236
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,950
I am a mess.

237
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,270
I cry all day. I feed all night.

238
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,980
All I can think about is how much I miss my daughter.

239
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,199
Do you think you're alone in that pain?

240
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,659
Have you even thought about her once?

241
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,440
I have not stopped thinking about her.

242
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,489
When it pains me, I seek comfort in the idea

243
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,950
of what I will do to those who would harm her.

244
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,690
Concentrate.

245
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,040
Davina is on her way.

246
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,329
By the time she gets here, you need to be gone.

247
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,089
I'm not going anywhere till I know the whereabouts of that stake.

248
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,750
You think she's just gonna cooperate with you standing here?

249
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,889
First thing I learned living with your family,

250
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,280
wherever you people go,

251
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,949
threats and bloodshed are soon to follow.

252
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,740
So just stay out of sight. Try not to kill anyone.

253
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,930
46,

254
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,460
an entire tenement building,

255
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,630
46 bodies drained.

256
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,570
Nonsense.

257
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,670
It's at least 60.

258
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,090
Ah, they neglected to check the attic.

259
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,929
Why do people always run for the attic?

260
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,079
I mean, it makes no sense.

261
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,499
It's difficult enough to keep our presence

262
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,669
in the city a secret without the two of you

263
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,210
doing absolutely everything in your power

264
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,229
to draw attention to us.

265
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,380
I'm surprised you have the time to concern yourself with us,

266
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,829
given the hours you spend doting on Marcellus.

267
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,760
Is that what all this is about?

268
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,459
You envy my bond with Marcellus.

269
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,610
Niklaus, you brought that child into this home.

270
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,820
He is no longer safe here.

271
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,159
I cannot allow him to remain.

272
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,029
You would punish the boy because of Kol's antics?

273
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,689
I'd just as soon put him in a box.

274
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,339
You'd choose that little whelp over our own family?

275
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,430
That little whelp is our family.

276
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,280
Marcellus stays.

277
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,019
Long time, little D.

278
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,939
Got your text. What's going on?

279
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,640
Oh, come here. I don't get a hug?

280
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,540
It's good to see you, Marcel.

281
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,060
It's good to see you, too.

282
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,430
I appreciate you coming all the way out here.

283
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,010
How's school? Make any new friends?

284
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,019
I don't know.

285
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,550
This guy asked me out, but then he stood me up.

286
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,100
He stood you up?

287
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,550
You say the word, he's dead.

288
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,779
Ok. Look.

289
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,559
I hate to ask for a favor,

290
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,960
but I need a locator spell.

291
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,579
Something is missing... A white oak stake.

292
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,530
It's powerful enough to kill an original.

293
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:41,540
Did one of them put you up to this?

294
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,510
D, if that stake is used on Klaus,

295
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,479
every vampire that he sired dies, too.

296
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,390
I know.

297
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,950
What if I do find it?

298
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,879
I mean, I am not just gonna give it to Klaus.

299
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,189
He and Elijah are both brutal,

300
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,369
sadistic monsters.

301
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,600
I do wish I could disagree with you.

302
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,060
Tragically, however, you're quite right.

303
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,880
Although you and I both have excellent reason to find that weapon.

304
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:10,999
I want it to protect my family,

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,840
and you want it to protect your friends.

306
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,850
We'd do well to forget our grievances and join forces.

307
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,260
No.

308
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,100
- Davina, would you just...  - No.

309
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,350
No. I'm done listening.

310
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,230
For a long time, you and your family have had all the power.

311
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,490
You manipulate and kill anyone who gets in your way.

312
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,950
That time is over.

313
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,630
From now on, you can know what it is to be afraid.

314
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,710
I asked you to stay out of sight.

315
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,359
I wanted to speak to her face to face.

316
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,600
Why, so that you could piss her off?

317
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,900
I wanted to see for myself.

318
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,189
She cares for you, and yet how cavalier

319
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,630
she was at the jeopardy that you now face.

320
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,199
What are you saying?

321
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,639
She knows the stake will not be used

322
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,830
because she knows precisely where it is.

323
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,850
She's had it all along.

324
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,729
So Jackson is MIA,

325
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,800
and Oliver seems to think he's the alpha.

326
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,600
They're not gonna listen to me.

327
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,909
The crescent mark on your shoulder

328
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,450
did not disappear when you became a hybrid.

329
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,000
Go on. Talk to them.

330
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,580
What the hell you two want?

331
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,359
Hold your tongue,

332
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,059
or I'll tear it from your gaping mouth.

333
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,930
We didn't come here to fight, Oliver.

334
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,049
Our pack has been divided by people

335
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,110
that want us to be their slaves.

336
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,700
What we need right now is a leader,

337
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,030
someone who will reunite us and make us strong again,

338
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,360
someone who will fight for our pack.

339
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,150
If you let me, I can be that person.

340
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,590
You think we can trust you?

341
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,289
You're not one of us. Hell, you're not even a wolf.

342
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,339
You're a bloodsucking vampire parasite.

343
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,250
Want to say that again and see what happens, Oliver?

344
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,450
Tough girl.

345
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,630
You gonna attack me in front of all them?

346
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,289
You'll just give them another reason to say yes

347
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,019
to Cassie and her moonlight rings.

348
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,990
Yeah. They would rather follow a witch than you.

349
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,250
Me, hell, I would rather die than follow you.

350
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,120
Well, we shouldn't drag this out.

351
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,640
Let him go, Klaus.

352
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,689
You need to learn about the art of politics, love.

353
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,709
You gain support by killing your detractors.

354
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,089
They may not like me very much,

355
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,409
but these people, including Oliver, are my family.

356
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,340
Let him go now.

357
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,560
You see, there's your queen--

358
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,600
Powerful, fearless, and, unlike me, merciful.

359
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,570
These people need to show you more respect.

360
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,970
How you handle them now is up to you.

361
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,880
Where are you going?

362
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,390
I'm going to find the witch.

363
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,319
Seems I need to educate her as to what she may

364
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,290
or may not do in my city.

365
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,849
The stake is safe.

366
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,179
Davina won't use it on Klaus if it would kill me.

367
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,820
Well, she has no reason whatsoever not to use it on me.

368
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,820
I guess you better behave.

369
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,480
And how long before someone else should make this discovery?

370
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,209
What if it falls into enemy hands?

371
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:32,339
Look. I'll get her to give the stake back, all right?

372
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,779
Just give me some time.

373
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,629
Unfortunately, Marcel,

374
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,550
unlike these wretched souls that you recruit here,

375
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,509
your promises do little to inspire my faith.

376
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,579
One way or another, Davina will comply.

377
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,720
Ok.

378
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,629
Do you ever wonder why your family has so many enemies?

379
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,270
It's because you make stupid moves like this.

380
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,559
It really makes me wonder how the hell

381
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,240
I ever survived you people.

382
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,270
Please let me go home.

383
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,019
Mr. Kol, I don't like this.

384
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,369
Don't be absurd.

385
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,919
Shakespeare should be experienced in the flesh.

386
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,649
In truth, these aren't the finest actors,

387
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,530
but we are in the colonies.

388
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,000
Here.

389
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:07,690
Where were we?

390
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,500
Then, venom, to thy work.

391
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,949
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Harlot.

392
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,010
No.

393
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,670
How many times must I tell you?

394
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,210
It's "Hamlet," not "Harlot."

395
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,100
Sometimes I don't know why I bother.

396
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,040
What have you done?

397
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,840
I was just introducing Marcellus to the theater.

398
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,940
I thought you'd be pleased.

399
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,890
Is there no limit to your vile imagination, brother?

400
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,619
If the lad is going to be a vampire,

401
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,020
he'll have to learn somehow, won't he?

402
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Come.

403
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,709
I've already fed him my blood.

404
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,730
All you have to do is snuff him,

405
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,140
and, voila, one of us.

406
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,450
Well, that's what you want...

407
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,890
Isn't it?

408
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,720
Let him go, Elijah.

409
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,950
Thank you, Nik.

410
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,620
At least someone knows the meaning of family.

411
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,600
I told you before.

412
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,580
Marcellus is family.

413
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,169
I don't fault you for your suspicion,

414
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,879
nor Davina for her contempt.

415
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,849
That does not alter our present dilemma.

416
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,580
She has that stake.

417
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,380
I want it back.

418
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,339
Stare at it all you want,

419
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,209
but as long as I have this bracelet,

420
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,830
I own you.

421
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,779
You foolish little girl.

422
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,419
You imprison me here, you refuse my help.

423
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:47,919
All the while,

424
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,540
that hybrid monstrosity roams the city,

425
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,970
free to prey on anyone you care about,

426
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,250
those few that remain.

427
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,310
What happened to decorum?

428
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,330
Does no one greet their guests anymore?

429
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,490
Well, that's more like it,

430
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,199
although I am rather disappointed

431
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,250
at how many of my once formidable brethren

432
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,900
have been neutered by a 16-year-old girl.

433
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,740
Where is she?

434
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,959
Where is this witch who dares craft moonlight rings

435
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,420
without my permission?

436
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,130
Niklaus...

437
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,450
I've been expecting you.

438
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,760
I must offer my condolences

439
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,189
On the tragic loss of your child.

440
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,980
Wasn't it your coven who threatened her life?

441
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,719
Is that tea your idea of a peace offering?

442
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,850
Chamomile has lots of healing properties.

443
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,510
Did you know that it's also a flowering plant?

444
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,110
I did.

445
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,019
The plants grew wild near my boyhood home,

446
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,459
But neither the tea nor your botanical musings

447
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,919
explain the reason why you've taken it

448
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,089
upon yourself to forge new moonlight rings.

449
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,140
I assumed it was obvious.

450
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,099
An alliance between the wolves and the witches

451
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,280
would restore balance to our home.

452
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,650
That's a lofty goal for a teenage girl.

453
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,989
Long ago, the witches and the wolves were at peace.

454
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,020
Then came the vampires,

455
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:01,510
a plague made flesh,

456
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,540
a curse on this earth.

457
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,670
You have no humanity,

458
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,560
And so you punish those who do.

459
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,739
Witches have a coven, werewolves have a pack,

460
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,119
and so we are a constant reminder

461
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,859
of everything that you have forsaken.

462
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,399
Creatures such as you will always hate the living,

463
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,150
and so we will always have to defend ourselves.

464
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,500
The rings level the playing field.

465
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,349
If we ware united,

466
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,720
nothing can stand against us.

467
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,180
It's an ambitious strategy,

468
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:40,809
but allow me to offer a few words of advice,

469
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,710
if I may be so bold.

470
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:46,190
New Orleans is a vicious place,

471
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,500
and your enemies are everywhere--

472
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,110
Behind your back, before your eyes.

473
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,259
You will need to remain vigilant against those

474
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,550
who would seek to destroy you,

475
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,060
some of whom you may never see coming.

476
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,770
I've already begun to take precautions.

477
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,680
In fact, I'm taking them as we speak.

478
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,390
My family?

479
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,640
Oh, no.

480
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,550
They're all crazy as loons.

481
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,070
How about your family?

482
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,840
Not much to say.

483
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,220
Only child.

484
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,200
My dad was distant,

485
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,550
which is a lot better than my mom.

486
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,570
Mommy issues, eh?

487
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,720
Bet she's a control freak, right?

488
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,960
Yeah. Same as mine.

489
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,760
She's the reason we stopped practicing magic for so long.

490
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,730
You're a witch?

491
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,459
Don't look so surprised, luv.

492
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,040
I didn't just ask you out because you're gorgeous.

493
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,619
No. We're, uh-- we're kindred souls.

494
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,830
What do you mean?

495
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,180
I know your story, Davina.

496
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,059
I mean, you're practically famous.

497
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,940
You're the harvest girl who told them all to shove it.

498
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm a lot like you.

499
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,300
Don't really believe in rules or authority.

500
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,280
Your courage, it should be celebrated.

501
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,840
I'm so sorry.

502
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,250
He'll just keep calling until I answer.

503
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,870
I'll make it quick.

504
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,630
You're stalling.

505
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,570
No. That's not creep at all,

506
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,420
watching me on me own date.

507
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,689
Stop complimenting her and find out

508
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,469
what she's hiding.

509
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,219
I'm wooing her, Vincent.

510
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,339
It requires charm and personality,

511
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,310
something you'd know nothing about.

512
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,079
Our mother wants answers,

513
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,509
and if you can't get them,

514
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,519
we'll do this my way.

515
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,329
Oh. What are you gonna do,

516
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,129
you gonna bore her

517
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,340
until she can't help but tell you everything?

518
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,089
If you want to find out if someone has a weapon,

519
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,120
you provoke them into using it.

520
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,980
I never said I had it.

521
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,409
The thing is, Elijah thinks you do.

522
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,389
Matter of fact, he's convinced.

523
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,590
Well, let Elijah think what he wants.

524
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,770
You're not save, D.

525
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,539
Anyone who's ever wanted to kill an original

526
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,989
is gonna be coming after you.

527
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,820
Fine.

528
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,279
Let them try.

529
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,360
D, come on. Just tell me where you are.

530
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,989
We can talk about this.

531
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,539
I'm at Rousseau's. Don't bother coming.

532
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,840
I'm leaving now.

533
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,360
Kaleb?

534
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:30,069
What's happening?

535
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,639
Some fellow just announced they were closing

536
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,290
for a private party.

537
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,699
We should leave now.

538
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,210
And what's your rush, sweetheart?

539
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,810
Why don't you stay and party with us?

540
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,770
Get out of our way now.

541
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,729
Can you do that with the rest of them, or...

542
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,100
Not all at once.

543
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,840
You filthy dogs.

544
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,410
Well, now.

545
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,020
What an interesting turn of events.

546
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,830
I'm going to enjoy this, girl.

547
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,370
Father.

548
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,579
Hello, son.

549
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,089
I'd hoped to see your brother first,

550
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,800
but we have some unfinished business, as well.

551
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,609
We're getting out of here.

552
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,490
No, Marcel. I need my bracelet.

553
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,820
I can use it to control him.

554
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,900
Stop!

555
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,870
Go back now.

556
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,500
Something to say?

557
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,200
Not me, mate.

558
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,120
Not a bloody thing.

559
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,410
Chamomile.

560
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,830
It's the same tea my mother made.

561
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,970
How I loathed it.

562
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,120
Would you have preferred mint?

563
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,990
You know, she was insane--my mother.

564
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,820
No. It's true.

565
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:29,049
She believed we were abominations.

566
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,979
"A curse on this earth

567
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,899
stretched out over generations"

568
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,420
Is how she put it?

569
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,040
But she was the true monster.

570
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,609
She changed her children,

571
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,789
stole our innocence, made us vampires,

572
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:47,030
condemned us to an eternity of bloodlust

573
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,470
and then

574
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,390
acted as if we were to blame.

575
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,370
She sounds awful.

576
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,280
Are you building to a question, Niklaus?

577
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,780
You use my full name

578
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,530
as though we are familiars.

579
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,880
I find it insulting.

580
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,809
Before she died, a witch revealed

581
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,990
that your coven was under my mother's influence.

582
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,070
Does she speak to you now?

583
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,370
She doesn't have to.

584
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:27,700
I know exactly what she would say.

585
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,200
She would tell you to go to your room

586
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:32,490
for being so rude.

587
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,290
It's ok. Niklaus was just leaving.

588
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:48,649
I will happily kill them all.

589
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,979
Then you will have murdered members

590
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,130
of the very pack you still hope to someday lead.

591
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,940
Besides, there's no need for bloodshed.

592
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,010
We can always resume this discussion another day.

593
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,010
Good night, Niklaus.

594
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,240
We will speak again soon.

595
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:16,290
It is worse than we thought.

596
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,350
I met the witch-- Cassie.

597
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,849
I studied her, her presence,

598
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,040
the way she carried herself,

599
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,030
the fervor with which she voiced her hatred of our kind.

600
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,589
I looked into that girl's eyes,

601
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,519
and I swear to you, Elijah,

602
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,819
she is not just guided by our mother.

603
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,990
She is our mother.

604
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,790
What is happening?

605
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,310
I'm going to kill her.

606
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,279
I will boil her bones

607
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,909
and feed them to the dogs if that's what it takes.

608
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:50,989
Niklaus.

609
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,000
What?!

610
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,950
What could possibly be more important

611
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,269
than the return of our mother?

612
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,550
Our father.

613
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,380
I saw him standing there in the flesh as you do now.

614
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,009
He was enslaved with some spell cast by Davina.

615
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,430
He holds the stake.

616
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,760
If she chooses to release him...

617
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,959
Well, then there's only one question

618
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,660
we need to ask, isn't there?

619
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:33,410
Which of our parents do we kill first?

620
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,830
Take any of the rooms on the first floor.

621
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,120
Are we running a kennel now?

622
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,110
I'll handle them.

623
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,309
Our family is under siege.

624
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,119
It is not the time for guests.

625
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,109
If they're not with us,

626
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,459
they're with the witches.

627
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,480
You asked me to step up.

628
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,010
This is me stepping up.

629
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,310
Well, it seems I'm a good influence on you after all.

630
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,710
I see a change in him.

631
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,279
For the first time in centuries,

632
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,820
he acted solely for the benefit of another.

633
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,730
I believe that young Marcellus

634
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,380
with whom he can identify and even nurture

635
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,279
holds the key to our brother's troubled soul.

636
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,930
Unfortunately, Kol,

637
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,299
your wretched behavior will only sere to distract him

638
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,320
from this auspicious path.

639
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,179
Now you might well consider me a hypocrite

640
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,419
to betray you as I have,

641
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,980
but for his sake,

642
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,700
you must sleep.

643
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,570
Even I must make certain sacrifices...

644
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,879
If indeed we are the preserve the precious bond

645
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,120
between Niklaus and that child.

646
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,729
Elijah, I did it!

647
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,329
I memorized the whole passage.

648
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,429
I could perform it for you.

649
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,580
Could you now?

650
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,739
Marcellus, have you ever considered

651
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,089
you might not be the center of the given universe?

652
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,339
Niklaus!

653
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,749
Are you angry with me?

654
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,599
Bored would be a more accurate description.

655
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,179
Niklaus, please!

656
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,220
What?

657
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,930
What is it?

658
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,300
Remove him.

659
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,889
You brought him here.

660
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,969
He's your burden to bear,

661
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,120
if indeed we are to accommodate

662
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,790
this little scavenger.

663
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,330
Come now, little warrior.

664
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,110
Let's have another go at the bar, shall we?

665
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,639
I don't see Oliver amongst them.

666
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,739
Am I to assume you finished him off?

667
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,960
We made a deal.

668
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,769
He'll pledge his loyalty to Cassie,

669
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:43,679
report back, and tell me everything that he learns.

670
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,840
Well done.

671
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,430
You girls can just go in here.

672
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,670
Well, you two have your hands full.

673
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,880
Were you just leaving?

674
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,320
To be perfectly honest with you,

675
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,590
the presence of all of them here,

676
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,570
it's--it's a little much.

677
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,370
No. Perhaps it's for the best.

678
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,140
You should be with your kind.

679
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,670
What the bloody hell was that, huh?

680
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,109
You need to calm down now.

681
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:33,689
You almost got me killed.

682
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,159
Those wolves didn't just go after Davina.

683
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,499
They almost attacked me!

684
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,970
I'm aware. I gave the order.

685
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,750
The attack had to look convincing.

686
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,870
Look at my head.

687
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,929
This isn't gonna heal for weeks!

688
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,869
I haven't had a scar in a thousand years!

689
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,630
You'll live, and more importantly,

690
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,180
Davina will feel indebted to you.

691
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,539
She will seek you out to apologize

692
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,969
for what she perceives as An attack

693
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,349
she caused as I planned.

694
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,310
Well, I've had enough of your plans.

695
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,019
You stick me in this body,

696
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,750
you force me to sneak around like some common toady.

697
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,549
If this is the grand new life that you planned for me,

698
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,569
then you can have it back!

699
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:18,100
You are here by my grace,

700
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,269
and you will remain by my grace.

701
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,690
Have I made myself clear?

702
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,010
Yes, yes.

703
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:47,139
Your brother was in the attic

704
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,439
during the attack.

705
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,910
Finn, tell him what you saw.

706
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,060
The door was open, the room was empty.

707
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,189
So, how did Davina

708
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,810
tear apart a pack of vicious wolves?

709
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,939
She must have had this weapon with her.

710
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,459
What is it-- a dark object,

711
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,060
a book of spells?

712
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,770
Well, I wish I knew.

713
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,670
I was knocked out during the attack.

714
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,010
I never saw a thing.

715
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,399
Let me guess.

716
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,230
Davina's nowhere to be found.

717
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,429
She wasn't in the attic,

718
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,770
wasn't anywhere near the lycee.

719
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,409
I have people looking all over this city.

720
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,999
She is gone.

721
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,939
No doubt to protect Mikael while he recovers

722
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:57,160
from the wounds he sustained.

723
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,470
She's scared.

724
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,120
What do you expect?

725
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,410
If I discover that you had even the slightest suspicion

726
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,829
that she brought father back....

727
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,950
Yeah. What?

728
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,149
You gonna threaten me, my people?

729
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,260
I mean, get in line. The witches hate us,

730
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,539
the wolves can kill us any time they like.

731
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,929
I can't even go into the quarter

732
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,669
without risking my damn life,

733
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,139
and I used to run the quarter,

734
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,990
and now Mikael's back,

735
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,069
the vampire who hunts vampires.

736
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,180
You really think that works in my favor?

737
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,679
You want my help finding Davina,

738
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,359
I need to know where you stand.

739
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,660
Now Klaus is on team wolf.

740
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,200
What are you?

741
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:35,769
I don't do teams.

742
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:37,790
I'm sorry, but that's not an option.

743
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,840
See, you're an original.

744
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,900
Every vampire that's ever been sired

745
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:45,260
is an extension of you and your family.

746
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,189
Now you can walk away from that

747
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,399
and side with Klaus and the wolves,

748
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,040
but you're not one of them,

749
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,490
and you never will be.

750
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,479
You want allies, right?

751
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,640
Look around.

752
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,540
This is ground zero for a new vampire community.

753
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,349
Now you may think that you're better than us,

754
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,670
but we're all you got.

755
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,519
And why would I play benefactor

756
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,100
to a collection of lost children?

757
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,550
That's right.

758
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,110
You never were any good with children,

759
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,500
but like it or not, vampires exist because of you.

760
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,130
And these folks are gonna need your help.

761
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,150
Her name's Gia.

762
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,280
I fed her my blood a few hours ago.

763
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:41,310
When she wakes up, she's gonna need a mentor.

764
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,890
I hope that you do better with her than you did with me.

765
00:41:48,746 --> 00:41:52,660
