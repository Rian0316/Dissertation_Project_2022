1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:02,998
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
KLAUS: Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:06,764
这座城市曾经是我的家
我不在的日子里
This town was my home once
and in my absence,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,204
马赛尔得到了我想要的一切
Marcel has got
everything I ever wanted.

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:11,037
我要夺回来
I want it back.

5
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:12,940
我在此宣誓效忠于你
I hereby pledge
my allegiance to you.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,538
- 莎莉丝特
- 莎莉丝特？
-Celeste.
-Celeste?

7
00:00:15,715 --> 00:00:17,979
不管她是谁，她确实非常性感
Whoever she was,
she was smoking hot.

8
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,277
我相信当你深爱着一个人
I believe that
when you love someone,

9
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:20,544
你会变得格外脆弱
you're uniquely vulnerable.

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,812
是我害死了她
She died because of me.

11
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,785
黛维娜，她是个强大的武器
Davina. She's a powerful weapon.

12
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,453
我知道我该被杀死
I knew that I was supposed
to be killed

13
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,684
以完成收获祭
so the harvest could be completed.

14
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,827
她死了
你听到了吗？
MARCEL: She is dead!
Do you hear me?

15
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:35,627
四个人本该复活的，但一个都没有
Four were supposed to rise,
and none did.

16
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:36,826
那些法力去哪了？
Where did all that power go?

17
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:38,664
有人召唤我们
TUNDE: Someone called us forth.

18
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,537
是谁？
- 是我
-Who?
-SABlNE: I did.

19
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,872
如果你们能叫我的真名，我会很感激的
叫我莎莉丝特
I'd appreciate if you call me
by my real name, Celeste.

20
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:57,880
我记得这处墓地
一点都没变
I remember this cemetery.
Hasn't changed a bit.

21
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,492
一个世纪来我无数次来到这里
I've been coming here
over a century

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,753
每次都是不同的面目
wearing one face or another.

23
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,420
克莱拉桑莫林，你能快点吗？
再不走就什么都看不到了
Clara Summerlin, will you come on?
We're gonna miss everything.

24
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,033
跟你说了吧
法语区的所有女巫都来了
Told you.
Every witch in the Quarter is here.

25
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,245
她们都是来见伟大的图德巫父
Come to see the great Papa Tunde.

26
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,401
法语区的女巫们
谢谢你们的热情欢迎
Witches of the French Quarter,
thank you for your welcome.

27
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,506
很高兴能与有信仰的人共聚一堂
It is good to be among
people of the faith.

28
00:02:21,674 --> 00:02:24,370
和你们一样，我修习的也是祖传魔法
I, too, practice ancestral magic,

29
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:26,910
向我们的先人致敬
honoring those
who walked the path before us.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,571
从他们的身上汲取力量
From them, we draw strength.

31
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,278
巨大的黑暗即将降临
你们会需要足够的力量与之对抗
And you will need strength,
for a great darkness is coming.

32
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,945
你们祖先留下的城市
The city your forefathers left you

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,025
如今正被海盗、野兽
和吸血鬼肆意蹂躏
is now overrun by pirates,
beasts and vampires.

34
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,013
我还修习了另外一种魔法
献祭魔法
TUNDE: I practice other
magic as well... Sacrificial magic...

35
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,243
透过从祭品的生命中汲取力量
Channeling power from
the lives of my offerings,

36
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:07,682
我利用这些力量来征服我的敌人
I use this strength
to vanquish my enemies.

37
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,051
我也会让你们的敌人为贪婪付出代价
And I will punish
your enemies for their greed.

38
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:17,456
作为回报，你们要接纳我的家人
In return, you will accept
my family into your coven.

39
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:23,566
同时，听命于我
And me as your leader.

40
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,011
先生们，请不必狗谨
Gentlemen, make yourselves at home.

41
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,203
欧康诺市长看来有事耽搁了
Mayor O'Connell appears
to be running late

42
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,211
但今天要讨论的很多
所以我们先开始吧
but there's much to discuss,
so I shall begin.

43
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,180
等等我，老哥
KLAUS: One moment please, brother.

44
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,152
你知道我最喜欢参加这种
非法的小集会了
You know how much I enjoy
these illicit, little gatherings.

45
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,654
别担心
ELlJAH: Do not be troubled.

46
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,587
尽管我弟弟声名狼藉
但我向你们保证
Despite my brother's reputation,
I can assure you,

47
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,351
今天请你们来的目的是和谈
we've invited you here
to broker in peace.

48
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:49,756
我发誓
You have my word.

49
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:53,365
算你们运气好
我哥哥向来信守他的誓言
And, lucky for you,
my brother always keeps his word.

50
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:59,428
你们俩是葛雷拉犯罪家族的吧
You two are from
the Guerrera crime family,

51
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,632
一群粗野的盗贼和杀手
a brutish pack of thieves
and killers,

52
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,705
但比起你们在月圆夜的变身
and that's nothing compared
to what you become

53
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:06,811
- 简直就是小巫见大巫
- 好了，别说了
-on a full moon, is it?
-Yes, yes, yes.

54
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,507
当然了，狼人咬伤对真祖来说并不致命
Of course, a bite from your kind
is not lethal to an Original.

55
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,119
所以我们之间如果起了冲突
你们绝对没有好下场
Conflict between us
would not end well for you at all.

56
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,152
这是我们的提议
Let's state our proposal here.

57
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,381
我们兄弟俩掌握着这个城市的港口
My brother and l
control the ports of the city.

58
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,721
但随着禁酒令即将成为法律在这里实施
But with prohibition
soon to be the law of the land,

59
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,327
联邦对这里的管理会加强
there'll be a certain uptick

60
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,124
这是我们想要避免的
in the kind of federal presence
we prefer to avoid.

61
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,435
因此，我有个提议
Therefore, I'd like to suggest
a system whereby

62
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,570
在我们的监管下
under our supervision, of course.

63
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,763
葛雷拉家族可以
The Guerrera family can traffic alcohol

64
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,771
在纽奥良做贩酒的生意
into the city of
New Orleans for a profit.

65
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:41,847
一切都还是我们说了算
但我们的规矩仍然不会公开
We would still be in charge
but our rule would remain a secret.

66
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,180
听起来真不错
This all sounds very good.

67
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,445
但请告诉我
这对女巫们有什么好处？
Tell me,
how will it benefit the witches?

68
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,953
抱歉，这是私人集会
I am sorry.
This is a private meeting.

69
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,558
我知道，城市首领间的集会
Yes, for kings of the city.

70
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,162
但我也是首领
我也有我的规矩
But l, too, am a king,
and I have rules.

71
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,389
我很佩服你
I'm impressed.

72
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,262
你还真是野心勃勃，要不就是疯了
You're either quite ambitious
or quite mad.

73
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,131
怎么称呼呢，老兄？
What's your name, mate?

74
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:10,402
我是阿冯斯贝拉图德戴加洛
信徒们称我为图德巫父
I am Alphonz Bellatunde Delgallo,
Papa Tunde to my followers.

75
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:12,976
我是来要求你们向女巫们进贡
And I come to ask that the witches
be granted fair tribute

76
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,239
用以换取在这座城市生存的权利
for allowing your existence
in our city.

77
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,511
你的意思是，如今
你代表法语区的女巫吗？
Are you suggesting that you speak
for the French Quarter witches?

78
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,812
没错
I do now.

79
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,616
希望以后我们的谈判能顺利进行
And I expect our future
negotiations to go very smoothly.

80
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,750
为了确保这一点
我带来了一份礼物
As a guarantee, I brought a gift.

81
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,364
期待我们下一次的会面
I await our next gathering.

82
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,018
我想我们需要找个新市长了
Well, I suppose
we'll need a new mayor.

83
00:05:56,723 --> 00:06:00,853
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：巫师的复仇

84
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,657
马赛尔
主演：约瑟夫摩根
Hey, Marcel,

85
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,163
或许你知道是怎么回事
maybe you know what's going on.

86
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,525
克劳斯召集大伙过来
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
Klaus ordered us to meet here

87
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:07,658
他自己却不出现
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
and now he's a no-show.

88
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,324
你想要我怎么样？
主演：克莱儿荷特
What do you want from me?

89
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,666
如今是新的政权了
主演：克莱儿荷特
It's a new regime.

90
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,629
开始习惯吧
Get used to it.

91
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,204
亲爱的弟兄们，请听我说
主演：菲比托金
KLAUS: Dearest brethren,
your attention, please.

92
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,408
我相信你们一定会很惊讶
见到提艾里范舒
No doubt, you're all surprised
to see Thierry Vanchure,

93
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,209
一个因为杀害自己同胞
who's supposed to be
rotting in the garden

94
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,181
而本该在花园里腐烂的人
for the crime of killing
one of our own.

95
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,651
如今我决定亲自赦免他
And I personally decided
to issue him with a pardon.

96
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,022
希望你们都能热烈欢迎
I hope you'll all

97
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,323
提艾里回归
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
welcome home Thierry.

98
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:36,821
欢迎回来，兄弟
Welcome home, mate.

99
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,899
你看起来心情不错
You're in a good mood.

100
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,168
你应该多去几趟迷瀑镇
You should visit
Mystic Falls more often.

101
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,328
尽管我也想那么做
Well, as much as I might like to,

102
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,703
但我在这有更紧急的事要处理
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
I have pressing responsibilities here.

103
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:55,375
你们都知道
Now, as you all know,

104
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,039
女巫黛维娜已经离我们而去了
主演：莉雅派普斯
the witch Davina
is no longer with us.

105
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,410
没有了她，我们就没法继续监视
Without Davina,
we can no longer monitor

106
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,419
那些女巫邻居的一举一动
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
the activity
of our witch neighbors.

107
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:07,390
然而，由于收获祭的失败
However, since their Harvest failed,

108
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,084
她们很快就会永远失去法力
their magic
will soon be gone forever.

109
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,289
但在那之前，我们还是给她们点警告
Until then,
I say we keep them on their toes.

110
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:19,234
迪亚哥，我想请你带着兄弟们
去女巫区骚扰一下
Diego, I wonder if you might lead
a rousting in the cauldron.

111
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,372
兄弟们上吧
DlEGO: Let's do it.

112
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,877
马赛尔，我希望你能跟迪亚哥一起去
Marcel, I'd hoped
you would join Diego.

113
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,180
不了
Nah.

114
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,447
我今天请个假
I'm gonna take a personal day.

115
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,945
你尽管可以怀疑他
ELlJAH: Now, you may doubt him.

116
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,457
今天我见到尼克劳斯
对敌人展现出了仁慈
Today, I saw Niklaus demonstrate
mercy towards an enemy.

117
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,857
- 这难道不是进步吗？
- 得了吧，以利亚
-Tell me that's not progress.
-Please, Elijah.

118
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:47,295
你觉得是谁说服克劳斯
放提艾里出来的？
Who do you think convinced
Klaus to let Thierry out?

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,331
你为什么要这么做？
Why would you do such a thing?

120
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,129
因为尽管克劳斯放了他
Because, despite Klaus' reprieve,

121
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,967
提艾里仍鄙视他
制片：兰斯安德森
Thierry despises him.

122
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,128
我就喜欢提艾里这一点
I like that about Thierry.

123
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,740
我还喜欢他曾与女巫约会过
I also like that he used
to date a witch,

124
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,899
这样他对法语区的女巫也很熟悉
so he knows about
French Quarter covens.

125
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,099
或许他能帮我找到
Maybe he can lead me

126
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,769
偷取了收获祭法力的人
to whoever stole off
with the Harvest magic.

127
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,643
蕾贝卡
我们都对仪式的结果感到难过
Rebekah, we are all devastated
by the outcome of this ritual.

128
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,511
这就是问题所在，没有结果
That's just it.
There was no outcome.

129
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,176
我们都清楚那么强大的法力
不可能凭空消失
We both know that power like that
doesn't just vanish.

130
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,053
我认为有人偷了它
I say someone stole it.

131
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,182
我想知道是谁
制片：邦妮怀斯
I'd like to know who

132
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,921
然后与他们结成盟友
制片：邦妮怀斯
and then I'd like
to make an ally out of them.

133
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,823
到底是为了什么呢？
To what end, exactly?

134
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,625
我已经受够我们那暴虐的兄弟
I'm tired of being threatened
and controlled

135
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:21,959
终日的威胁与控制了
by our tyrant brother.

136
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,425
如果你要阻止一个恶徒
If you want to stop a bully,

137
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,764
你就必须要有足够的力量对抗他
you need the power
to stand up to them.

138
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,462
尼克劳斯这么干我不意外
I expect such behavior from Niklaus.

139
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,632
但你有这种想法
让我非常失望，蕾贝卡
It's so very disappointing
when it comes from you, Rebekah.

140
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,607
难道你没发现，他在用自己的方式
努力尝试改变吗？
Do you not see that in his way,
he's making an effort here?

141
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,377
他邀请我们回到那属于我们的家
编剧：麦可鲁梭，麦克纳度奇
He's invited us back
into our family home.

142
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,518
他渴望我们家族再次团聚
He yearns for our family
to be reunited.

143
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,153
对，他现在是心情不错
但这能持续多久呢？
Yes. He's in a brilliant mood now
but for how long?

144
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,983
这是他的诡计，以利亚
It's his trick, Elijah.

145
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,454
他先安抚你，给你一种…
He lulls you into a false sense

146
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,392
友情和亲情的错觉
导演：罗伯哈迪
of camaraderie and kinship

147
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,791
然后在一瞬间背叛你
and then he turns
on you like a snake.

148
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,021
我每次都上当
I fall for it every time

149
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,291
下场就是胸口上插着匕首
and wind up with a dagger
in my chest for my trouble.

150
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,456
我不要再这样了
No more.

151
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,162
我相信他正达到
一种近乎平和的境界
I believe that he is approaching
some semblance of peace here.

152
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,329
成为首领也许对他来说是件好事
Leadership may, in fact,
be a good thing for him.

153
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,409
现在，我请求你
如果你不能支持他
Now, sister, please, I ask you,
if you cannot support him,

154
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,239
至少别做任何会激怒他的事
then at least do nothing
to provoke him.

155
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:16,582
结果就是这样吗？
KLAUS: Is this what's it's come to?

156
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,121
我一个人肩负整个王国的重任
I bear the full weight
of our kingdom

157
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,758
而你在旁像个小孩一样闹脾气
while you pout like a child.

158
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,484
是你自己想当国王
You wanted to be King.

159
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,253
再说，你看来已经掌控住局面了
Besides, you look like
you got it covered.

160
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,488
如果手下看到你这副不负责任的样子
If the men see you
shirk your duties,

161
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:26,825
他们很可能也会这么做
they're likely to do the same.

162
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,400
我说过了，我没心情参加什么
吸血鬼的胡闹
I told you, I am not in
the mood for vampire hijinx.

163
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,561
是啊，你宁愿坐在这借酒浇愁
No. You'd rather sit
wallowing in sorrow

164
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,727
哀悼你的小朋友
for your lost little friend.

165
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,771
你最好别逼我
Don't push me right now!

166
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,672
黛维娜不在了我也很难过好吗？
我很遗憾
I am sorry Davina is gone, okay?
I'm sorry,

167
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,903
但这么一直消沉下去也于事无补
but this mournful attitude
is unworthy of you

168
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,570
我都快受不了你这臭脸了
and it's boring to me.

169
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,347
嘿，两位
我们遇到麻烦了
Hey guys, we got a problem.

170
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:53,692
我们按你说的，去找女巫的麻烦
We came to mess with the witches,
just like you said,

171
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,556
接着这两个弟兄失踪了
找到他们时就是这样了
and these two, they went missing,
found them like this.

172
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,221
身上甚至没插木桩，就这么死了
Not even staked, just dead.

173
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,470
你去哪？
Where are you going?

174
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,872
我们必须找出是谁干的
Someone has to account for this.

175
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:16,377
你想要复仇，自己去吧
You want revenge, get it yourself.

176
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,610
那个符号跟一种可怕的巫术有关
That mark is tied to some bad mojo.

177
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,186
你们如果有点脑子
就该赶紧回去
Any of y'all got any brains,
you'll head back to the compound

178
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,755
别插手此事
and stay the hell out of this.

179
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,559
我们要找出是谁干的
We're gonna find whoever did this,

180
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,068
然后让他们好好尝尝苦头
and I will show them
what suffering is.

181
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,839
我以前曾在这里帮马赛尔办事
THlERRY: Used to run
things down here for Marcel.

182
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,273
我想在报告给克劳斯之前先让你看看
Thought you'd like to see
what I found before Klaus did.

183
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,536
才刚从花园被放出来
Not a day out of the garden

184
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,270
你就立刻证明自己的用处了
and you're already
proving yourself useful.

185
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,436
这是我们达成的协定
We made a deal,

186
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,812
只要能坏你哥哥的好事
我会全力以赴
and if it screws things
for your brother, I'm all for it.

187
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,182
但老实说，这玩意让我毛骨悚然
Though, to be honest,
this stuff makes my skin crawl.

188
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,324
我从没见过这样的阵法
I've never seen anything like this.

189
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,824
我见过，很久很久以前
I have, a long time ago.

190
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,258
有人在模仿一个非常危险的巫师
Somebody is copycatting
a very dangerous witch.

191
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,993
他们以献祭获取法力
They draw their power
from sacrifice.

192
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,158
我只是不明白
I just don't understand

193
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,861
为什么会有人把阵法留下让我们找到
why someone would
leave it here for us to find.

194
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,368
除非他们是故意想被找到
Unless they wanted it to be found.

195
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,775
米卡森小姐
TUNDE: Mademoiselle Mikaelson.

196
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:26,316
- 这不可能
- 当然可能，亲爱的，这可是魔法
-That's not possible.
-Sure, it is, cherie. It's magic.

197
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,902
我一定要让他血债血偿
KLAUS: Someone will die for this.

198
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,738
出乎意料地，我并无异议
ELlJAH: Remarkably, I don't disagree.

199
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,107
但我想知道
他们从哪学的黑魔法
However, I would like to know
where they learned such dark magic.

200
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,579
我曾希望再也不要见到这符号
I had hoped never to see
that symbol again.

201
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,547
我记得这符号属于一个曾妄想
I recall it is the signature
of a fool

202
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,913
对付我们的傻子
who once stood against us.

203
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,113
显然有自命不凡的巫师试图故技重施
Clearly, some upstart witch
is salvaging old tricks.

204
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,758
我会像对之前那个一样处置他
I'll do for him as I did the other.

205
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:08,154
迪亚哥
Diego.

206
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,018
夜慕降临后
When night falls,

207
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,722
我要你召集法语区所有的吸血鬼
I want you to gather
every vampire in the Quarter.

208
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,495
把罪魁祸首的人头给我带来
然后把它插在一根棍子上
Get me the head of whoever did this,
and put it on a stick.

209
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,229
这可能有点问题
Yeah.
That's gonna be a problem.

210
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:22,496
大家都吓坏了，老大
Everyone is freaked out, man.

211
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:26,441
好久都没有吸血鬼死在巫师手上了
We haven't had witches
killing vampires in a long time.

212
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,045
马赛尔把我们保护得很好
Marcel made sure of that.

213
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,239
马赛尔像个被吓坏的小孩一样跑了
Marcel has run off like a scared child.

214
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,011
你们只能跟着我了
You lot are left with me.

215
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:43,084
现在，你们中哪一位
愿意为捍卫家园而战？
Now, who of you will fight
to defend our home?

216
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,527
没人愿意与我并肩作战
Not a single one of you
will stand with me,

217
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:53,297
你们就如此惧怕这个新的威胁吗？
so afraid are you of this new threat?

218
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,432
你们真该放聪明点
You should know better.

219
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,573
这事我亲自去处理
I'll handle this myself.

220
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,613
苏菲，赛厅里又乱成一团了
Sophie, the restaurant
is an epic disaster, again.

221
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,223
你今天能过来一趟吗…
Do you think maybe
you could come in today and--

222
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,382
用户的语音信箱已满，再见
AUTOMATED VOlCE:
User's mailbox is full. Goodbye.

223
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,619
看来我昨晚就该过来
Looks like I should've
been here last night.

224
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,593
你少轻举妄动，我体内有马鞭草
Before you try anything,
I'm on vervain.

225
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,130
知道，克劳斯说过你摆脱了他的魅惑
Yeah. Klaus mentioned
you broke free of his compulsion.

226
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,824
真不错
Good for you.

227
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,732
- 苏菲在吗？
- 不在，你找她干嘛？
-Sophie around?
-No. Why?

228
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,396
有个关于巫师的问题
我想她应该知道答案
Got a witch problem.
Thought she might have answers.

229
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:33,768
介意我在这等吗？
Mind if I wait?

230
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:40,650
大白天就开始喝酒
让我猜猜，克劳斯的问题
It's a little early for day drinking.
Let me guess, Klaus problems.

231
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:43,953
我还以为你们现在正高兴着呢
I thought you'd be
on top of the world

232
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,818
黛维娜都被你们给抓回去了
now that you have Davina back.

233
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,856
黛维娜死了
Davina is gone.

234
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,426
是克劳斯干的吗？
我警告过他，如果他敢伤害她…
Was it Klaus?
I told him, if he hurt her--

235
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,794
不是他干的
It wasn't like that.

236
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,630
她体内的法力太强
The power that she had was too much.

237
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:00,669
我们试图用一个疯狂的仪式
助她稳定法力
We tried to fix her
with this crazy-ass ritual,

238
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,273
结果出了问题
现在她…
and something went wrong.
Now she's--

239
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:06,707
我也不知道，也许正游荡在地狱边缘
或是等着她的先祖显灵什么的
I don't know. Floating in limbo
or waiting on her ancestors.

240
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,508
马赛尔
Marcel.

241
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,346
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,687
是啊，我也很遗憾
Yeah. Me, too.

243
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,206
- 你在这呢
- 我就在这呢
-There you are.
-Here I am.

244
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,338
这些是黛维娜的画
Davina's drawings.

245
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,845
是的，很恐怖，我知道
Yeah. Morbid, I know.

246
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,415
但我在想，我们一直没搞清楚
I was just thinking,
we never figured out

247
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,415
她为什么要画莎莉丝特
why she drew those
pictures of Celeste.

248
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,751
反正我也只是在消磨时间
既然我被吸血鬼关了禁闭
Anyway, I'm just killing time now
that I'm on vampire lockdown.

249
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:54,358
不管是谁干的，我们会想办法处理
事情很快就能解决
Whoever did this, we will deal
with them. It won't be long.

250
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,221
我不担心这个
I'm not worried.

251
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,260
只是觉得可笑的是
Just think it's kind of funny

252
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,557
得有重大的超自然威胁
that it took some big, supernatural threat

253
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,201
你才肯和我共处一室
for you to even come
into the same room as me.

254
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,605
若让你感到被怠慢了，我很抱歉
I do apologize
if you feel neglected.

255
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,867
我最近一直很忙
I have been occupied.

256
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:14,103
我的弟弟妹妹正在闹别扭
尼克劳斯又一直很焦躁
My siblings are in some quarrel.
Niklaus remains agitated.

257
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,272
你也记得，我们之间再短暂的交流
You'll recall that even
our slightest interactions

258
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:21,385
都会…激怒他
seem to infuriate him.

259
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,817
所以说克劳斯是个混蛋
而你想当个好哥哥
So Klaus is a dick,
and you want to be a good big brother.

260
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:30,223
所以我们不能在一起
So, we can't hang out.

261
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,393
概括起来是这样吗？
That sum it up?

262
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:42,067
我明白，以利亚
只是觉得这情形有够糟糕的
I get it, Elijah.
It just seems like a really crappy deal.

263
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,776
领袖的召唤吗？
El presidente?

264
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,546
他喜欢掌控手下的行踪
He likes to keep track of his people.

265
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,383
你为什么要效忠于他？
Why are you loyal to him, exactly?

266
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,422
你不是说受不了他吗
You know, for someone who says
she can't stand the guy,

267
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:02,560
干嘛一直追问关于他的事？
you sure ask a lot of questions
about him.

268
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,427
- 这只是纯学术性的好奇
- 我知道你想干嘛
-My interest is purely academic.
-I know what you're doing.

269
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,765
你气他利用你，想要报复他
You're mad he used you
and you wanna get back at him.

270
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,997
也许你在套我的话
希望我说出他的弱点
Maybe you're hoping I'll let slip
some chink in his armor.

271
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,800
给你句忠告，别干傻事
Friendly advice, don't do that.

272
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,265
不会有好下场
It won't end well.

273
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,277
我来跟你讲个试图
Let me tell you a story
about someone

274
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:27,646
对付克劳斯的人的故事吧
who went up against Klaus.

275
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,249
那时我刚从一战的战场回来
MARCEL: This was right after
I returned from World War I.

276
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,827
我一直想离开纽奥良
I'd been trying to get away
from New Orleans for a while.

277
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,328
（欢迎回家）

278
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,828
但却一直被吸引回来
But something kept drawing me back.

279
00:16:57,783 --> 00:16:59,148
你不对我说欢迎回来吗？
Aren't you gonna welcome me home?

280
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,014
我不想让你觉得我很高兴见到你
I wouldn't want you to think
that I was happy to see you.

281
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,155
你还要恨我多久？
How long you gonna hate me?

282
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:09,886
你让我在棺材里躺了52年
少说也得恨上个100年吧
You left me in a box for 52 years.
Twice that seems like a good start.

283
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,021
走吧，小伙子们
Come on, boys.

284
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:22,233
他在这呢
战争英雄凯旋归来啦
There he is.
Our war hero triumphantly returned.

285
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:25,400
你回来了我很高兴，马赛勒斯
Oh, good to have you back, Marcellus.

286
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,807
欢迎回家
Welcome home.

287
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,975
回头的浪子总算把酒量
The prodigal son
has finally learned

288
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,143
给练出来了
to hold his liquor.

289
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,154
- 都是军队的功劳
- 你能回来我们都很高兴
-The army'll do that to you.
-Well, it's good to have you back.

290
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:42,191
你不在尼克劳斯都快疯了
Niklaus was beside himself
in your absence.

291
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,589
既然你回来了
Now that you are here,

292
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,662
也许你能帮我们评评理
perhaps you could help
settle an argument.

293
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,268
国外的战争打完了
这里的战役又开始了
You see, you've traded a war abroad
for one here in the Quarter.

294
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,532
有个流氓巫师
想在我们建立的城市中分一杯羹
Some rogue witch
wants a piece of the city we built,

295
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,039
让我无法理解的是，以利亚居然
and Elijah, for reasons
beyond my comprehension,

296
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,839
坚持要以协商来解决分歧
insists that negotiation
is our best recourse.

297
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:04,175
好吧，既然说到无法理解的事
Yes. On the topic
of your failed comprehension,

298
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,909
你忘了，身为一名军人
马赛尔已见识过
you forget, as a soldier,
Marcel has seen

299
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,781
世界现在变得有多小
not only how small the world
has become

300
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,683
以及消息传播速度之快
and how fast news can travel,

301
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,051
但最重要的是，战争的恐怖之处
but also,
the very horrors of war itself.

302
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,090
理所当然，马赛尔会认同我的做法
Surely, Marcel would agree with me.

303
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,754
要想捍卫我们的家园，最好的办法
The best way for us
to defend our home

304
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,919
就是谨慎行事
is by exercising discretion.

305
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,400
你想杀的巫师是谁？
So, who's the witch
you wanted to kill?

306
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,297
他叫图德巫父
His name is Papa Tunde.

307
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,573
我觉得他只是个江湖骗子
I think he's a charlatan.

308
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,971
马赛尔很快就能自己判断他的为人了
Well, Marcel shall be able
to decide that for himself.

309
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,450
- 你还邀请了他
- 当然
-You invited him here.
-Of course.

310
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,382
我们又不是野蛮人
，对吧？
We're not savages, aren't we?

311
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:51,058
谢谢你应邀前来
欢迎
Thank you for accepting
our invitation, and welcome.

312
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,425
希望你能让我尽地主之谊
I hope you'll allow me
to play the role of host.

313
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:55,226
如果你们需要任何东西
If there's anything you need...

314
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,099
敬请随意享用
Anything at all....

315
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,908
那就先娱乐再谈正事了
Pleasure before business, then.

316
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:12,311
起初我并不明白
MARCEL ; I didn't get it at first.

317
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,511
想要挑起战争的是克劳斯
Klaus was the one
who wanted to go to war.

318
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,817
那他为什么要把敌人邀请到家中来？
So, why was he inviting his enemy
into his home?

319
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,984
为什么要慷慨招待自己欲杀之人？
Why be so generous to someone
who he's gonna have to kill?

320
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,153
但要知道，这就是关键所在
But, you see, that's the thing.

321
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,890
这一切都是克劳斯密谋的计划
It was all part of Klaus' plan.

322
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,001
他是在试探敌方的底细
He was sussing the guy out,

323
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,363
模清他的弱点与实力
Iearning his weaknesses,
his strengths,

324
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,028
让他放下防备
getting him to let his guard down.

325
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,337
这就是克劳斯的作风
最后再一举灭敌
That's how Klaus does it.
Then he goes in for the kill.

326
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,105
因为他是个人面兽心的反社会变态
Because he's a two-faced sociopath.

327
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:44,715
克劳斯的所作所为没什么好羡慕的
There's nothing enviable
about what Klaus does.

328
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:46,851
他是个怪物
He's a monster.

329
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,611
我们都是怪物，卡蜜
We're all monsters, Cami.

330
00:19:48,787 --> 00:19:50,220
如果你像克劳斯那样强大
If you're powerful like Klaus is,

331
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:51,720
你也会不屑于隐藏的
you just don't have
to bother hiding it.

332
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,986
黛维娜也很强大
Davina was powerful.

333
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,391
但她不是怪物
She wasn't a monster.

334
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,556
仪式完成了
PAPA TUNDE: It is done.

335
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,831
真祖妹妹的力量传给了我
The power of the Original sister
flows through me.

336
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,497
这力量足以让克劳斯生不如死吗？
And will that be enough
to make Klaus suffer?

337
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,576
克劳斯米卡森当初对我的伤害
我会以牙还牙的
I will hurt Klaus Mikaelson
as he hurt me.

338
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,773
等我完成
他会祈求自己能早点解脱
When I am done,
he will wish that he could die.

339
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,028
- 你今天打算营业吗？
- 冒着让你吃掉客人的风险吗？
-You gonna open this place today?
-And risk you eating the clientele?

340
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,563
我还以为你又开始喜欢我了呢
Oh, and here I thought
you were starting to like me again.

341
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,966
你终于舍得走出悲伤
接我电话了
You've deigned to break your despair
long enough to pick up the phone.

342
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,668
我不接你会一直打
I figured you'd just keep calling.

343
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,780
我现在在女巫区
你可以来这里见我
KLAUS: I'm in the cauldron now.
You could meet me here.

344
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,280
我们可以先绑些路人在火刑往上烧
We could start burning
passersby at the stake.

345
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,214
抱歉，我要追踪我自己的线索
Sorry. I'm gonna chase
down my own lead.

346
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,250
那线索在哪里呢？
威士忌的瓶底吗？
And where might that be,
the bottom of a bottle of Scotch?

347
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,289
我在苏菲德弗罗这里
I'm at Sophie Deveraux's place.

348
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,121
我打算就坐在这里一直喝到她出现
I figured I'll sit here
and drink until she shows.

349
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:41,096
或者你可以从恐惧中摆脱出来
然后来帮我结束这一切
Or you could snap out of this funk
and come and help me end this.

350
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,472
大坏蛋克劳斯米卡森
Big, bad Klaus Mikaelson.

351
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,278
苏菲
Sophie.

352
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,747
恰好是我想要折磨的女巫
Just the witch
I was looking to brutalize.

353
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,314
或许你可以解释一下对我手下的攻击
Perhaps you could explain
the attacks on my men.

354
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,453
蕾贝卡不接电话
Rebekah is not answering her calls.

355
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,757
你担心杀死这些日行者的人
You worried about
whoever killed those Daywalkers

356
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:14,921
还在外面吗？
still being out there?

357
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,331
坦白说，我是担心她跟这事有关
Frankly, I'm worried that she had
something to do with this.

358
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,596
她对尼克劳斯非常不满
She's very displeased with Niklaus.

359
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,431
或许甚至会和其他人
Perhaps even conspiring...

360
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,201
一起密谋些什么
...with others.

361
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:30,109
提艾里，是吗？
Thierry, is it?

362
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,208
没错
That's right.

363
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,285
你知道我妹妹非常喜欢你
Do you know,
my sister is rather fond of you.

364
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,821
奇怪，她通常不会被不起眼的男人吸引
Strange, she's not typically
drawn to unremarkable men.

365
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:43,286
你能解释一下你突如其来的魅力吗？
Would you care to explain
your sudden magnetism?

366
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:45,828
我不知道你在…
I don't know what you're--

367
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,794
要嘛告诉我你知道些什么
You can either tell me what you know

368
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,834
要嘛我就把你撕碎撒在这片法语区里
or I can distribute tiny pieces
of you throughout the Quarter.

369
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,173
她要我留意女巫的事
She asked me to keep
an eye out on witch stuff.

370
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,807
我所有发现
I found something,

371
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,876
在我带她看时
我们被一个人偷袭了
and when I showed her,
we were jumped by some guy.

372
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,343
他碰到她就把她变干了
He desiccated her with his touch.

373
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:05,642
你就像个懦夫丢下了她
Like a coward, you left her.

374
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,580
那我该怎么做
和那个能把真祖榨干的巫师
What was I supposed to do,
fight some warlock

375
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:08,742
打一架吗？
that took out an Original?

376
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,319
这在哪里发生的？
Where was this, exactly?

377
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,914
码头，57号仓库
The docks, warehouse 57.

378
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:18,085
我只是按她要求去做
你不能把这些告诉克劳斯
I was just doing what she asked.
You cannot tell Klaus about this.

379
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,499
我会考虑的
I shall take that
into consideration.

380
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,401
- 我和你一起去
- 不，留在这里，这里很安全
-I'm coming with you.
-No. Stay here. Compound is safe.

381
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,337
蕾贝卡遇上麻烦了，我要去
Rebekah is in trouble.
I'm going.

382
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,242
不许离开我的视线，明白吗？
Do not leave my sight.
Understand?

383
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:44,618
你知道，终止和你的关系
并不是因为我不喜欢你
You know. Calling things off with you
wasn't lack of interest.

384
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:49,389
我只是希望能让你远离这一切
I was hoping
to save you from all this.

385
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,689
谢了，罗密欧，但我已经深陷其中
Well, thanks, Romeo, but I'm in it.

386
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,391
你打算什么时候才会说到
So, when are you gonna get
to the good part

387
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,537
克劳斯还有那个什么巫父的事呢？
with Klaus and that Papa guy?

388
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,935
图德巫父说他想要赋予女巫权利
Papa Tunde said he wanted
to empower the witches.

389
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,201
主要的是，他想要金钱和领土
Mostly, he wanted money
and territory.

390
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,106
克劳斯和以利亚一样都不打算满足他
Klaus and Elijah weren't about
to give him either.

391
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,079
他不喜欢那样，所以他发在了
He didn't like that,
so he went on a rampage.

392
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,307
没人是安全的
No one was safe.

393
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,818
决策群的人类不安全
Not the humans in the faction.

394
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,789
葛雷拉的狼人不安全
MARCEL; Not the Guerrera werewolves.

395
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:30,701
他甚至去追杀那些反对他的女巫
He even went after the witches
who opposed him.

396
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,406
以利亚提出了休战
事实上，他做出了承诺
Elijah offered a truce.
He gave his word, in fact.

397
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:40,534
但克劳斯，一如既往，另有打算
But Klaus, being Klaus,
he had another idea.

398
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:41,838
你迟到了，以利亚
You' re late, Elijah.

399
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:44,072
高尚的哥哥不会让我久等的
It's not like the noble brother
to keep me waiting.

400
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:46,183
抱歉，老兄
I'm sorry, mate.

401
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,787
以利亚是在谈判还可能存在时
你所见到的兄弟
Elijah is the brother you meet
when negotiations are to be had.

402
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:53,482
我则是谈判无效时你会见到的人
I'm the one you get
when negotiations are closed.

403
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,852
你吓不了我
You do not scare me.

404
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:57,460
你不知道我有多大的力量
You have no idea the power I possess.

405
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,757
事实上，我特别研究了一下
你所有的力量
In fact, I made it a point
to learn all about your power.

406
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:03,833
我注意到你几乎寸步不离
你的双胞胎儿子
I noticed how you're almost always
near those twin sons of yours.

407
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,267
以及他们为何有你的特殊印记
How they bear your distinctive mark.

408
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,963
这让我不禁思考
Got me to thinking.

409
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,870
你引用了他们的力量，对吧？
You channel their power, don't you?

410
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:14,635
当然，这就引出了一个问题
Which, of course, begs the question,

411
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:17,304
如果那些力量被拿走了会怎么样
what would happen
were that power to be taken away,

412
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:22,351
如果你的儿子们
也就是你力量的来源
if those sons,
whose lives you depend on...

413
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,013
突然被杀死了会怎么样？
...were suddenly struck down...

414
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:36,390
到时那些力量会怎么样呢？
What of that power then?

415
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:48,011
- 我要杀了你报仇
- 我是杀不死的
-I will kill you for this.
-I cannot be killed.

416
00:25:49,314 --> 00:25:50,372
然而你…
You, however...

417
00:25:53,251 --> 00:25:57,711
- 太可怕了
- 对克劳斯来说，这只是公事
-That's horrible.
-Oh, to Klaus, it's just business.

418
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,647
难道你不觉得这事
And don't you think
there's something

419
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,224
从根本上就有问题吗？
fundamentally wrong with that?

420
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,420
你就不担心你最后
也会成为他的受害者
Don't you worry you'll end up
one of his victims

421
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,859
或是更糟，变得和他一样？
or, worse, just like him?

422
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:12,594
可怜的马赛勒斯
TUNDE: Poor Marcellus.

423
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,366
你始终活在你父亲的阴影下
You remain always
in the shadow of your father.

424
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:22,613
从那下面爬出来吧，行吗？
这样你就能像个男人一样死去
Climb out from beneath it, will you?
So you can die like a man.

425
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,618
卡蜜，你快走
别回头，赶紧走
Cami, you need to run now.
Don't look back. Just go.

426
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,348
我觉得她应该留下
我更喜欢有个观众
I think she should stay.
I prefer an audience

427
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:37,689
我即将上演一出精彩好戏呢
and I'm about to put on
quite the show.

428
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,326
- 马赛尔？
- 我说了，快离开这里
-CAMl: Marcel?
-I said, get out of here.

429
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,667
你打败不了我的
You cannot defeat me.

430
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,104
我从一个吸血鬼真祖身上获得了力量
I channel the power
of an Original vampire.

431
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,144
很快，我就会获得三个真祖的力量
但首先，我要解决你
Soon, I will have all three,
but first, I will take you.

432
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,625
这是个复杂的咒语
SOPHlE: It's a complex spell.

433
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,633
传统的东西都起源于献祭魔法
Old-school stuff
rooted in sacrificial magic.

434
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,566
不管是谁对你的人干了这事
Whoever did this to your guys,

435
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,573
我猜他们
从祭品中获得了更多力量
my guess is, they were
an offering to gain more power.

436
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,644
杀的人越多，他们就越强大
More guys they kill,
more power they get.

437
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,549
没想到你这么快就打来了
I didn't expect a call
from you so soon.

438
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,415
你得赶紧来卢梭酒吧
You need to get to Rousseau's now.

439
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,217
某个疯子巫医要杀马赛尔
Some lunatic witch doctor
is killing Marcel.

440
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:42,383
尽可能远离那里
Get as far away from there
as you can.

441
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,397
蕾贝卡
ELlJAH: Rebekah.

442
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,399
怎么回事？
What's happening?

443
00:27:54,606 --> 00:27:56,267
某种边界咒语
Some kind of boundary spell.

444
00:27:58,076 --> 00:27:59,839
有人在利用她的力量
Someone is channeling her.

445
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,569
本来这个过程会致命
Typically, it's a lethal process,

446
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,577
但因为她是真祖，所以她死不了
but because she's an Original,
she cannot die.

447
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,276
相反，她就变成了无尽的力量泉源
Instead, she's an
endless source of power.

448
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,386
那我们该怎么办？
So, what are we supposed to do?

449
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,923
我们必须把她救出来
We have to get her out of there.

450
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,357
我记得，你是少数
As I recall,
you're one of the few people

451
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,430
尼克劳斯米卡森在乎的人之一
Niklaus Mikaelson
ever gave a damn about.

452
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,967
你知道他对我的家人做了什么
You know what he did to my family.

453
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:33,840
父罪子偿
The sins of the father
are paid for by the son.

454
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:37,243
我会很乐意告诉克劳斯你是怎么死的
I will take pleasure
in telling Klaus how you died.

455
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,080
我记得杀死了你，我可是很喜欢呢
I remember killing you.
I rather relished it.

456
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,050
再次体验愉悦的回忆多么令人高兴啊
What a joy it is
to relive fond memories.

457
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,192
你来了，很好
TUNDE: You're here. Good.

458
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,591
我可以在你儿子面前收拾你
I can crush you before the eyes
of your son

459
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:55,597
然后我会把你们两个消灭掉
and then I will consume you both.

460
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,833
这一次，我更强大了
This time, I am stronger.

461
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,436
你没有在听，我们没法进入圈内
You're not listening.
We cannot enter the circle.

462
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:11,844
有某种限制咒语之类的
There's some kind
of confinement spell or...

463
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,041
如果我不能移动她
我们就无法打破连结
If I can't remove her,
we can't break the link.

464
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,813
这是个迥旋咒
就像是女巫的食谱
It's a convoluted spell.
It's like a witch's recipe.

465
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,821
你可以加入更强烈的材料破坏平街
You can spoil the balance
by adding a more potent ingredient,

466
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,891
一种神秘的黏合剂，我也说不清
a mystical binding agent,
I don't know.

467
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,119
火山灰、岩盐
Volcanic ash, rock salt,

468
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,263
任何够多的东西，还包括嵘蝉的眼睛
anything up to
and including eye of newt.

469
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,026
- 女巫的血呢？
- 你有女巫的血吗？
-What about the blood of a witch?
-Do you have the blood of a witch?

470
00:29:36,141 --> 00:29:40,339
- 我需要你帮个忙
- 孩子
-I need a favor.
-The baby.

471
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,976
她有四分之一女巫血统
She's a quarter witch.

472
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,778
- 他死了吗？
- 快离开这里
-ls he dead?
-Get out of here.

473
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:54,885
马赛尔死了吗？那家伙杀了他吗？
Is Marcel dead?
Did that guy kill him?

474
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,647
他还没能杀死他
马赛尔需要血液来治愈
He didn't finish him off.
Marcel needs blood to heal.

475
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,756
去，给我从街上拉个人来
Go. Find me someone off the street.

476
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,255
- 我来吧
- 不行
-I'll do it.
-No.

477
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,926
你不行
我不想你被牵扯进这一切里
Not you.
I don't want you involved in this.

478
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:09,066
你再也不能控制我了，记得吗？
You don't control me anymore,
remember?

479
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,265
没事的，马赛尔
It's okay, Marcel.

480
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,274
没事的，没事的，马赛尔
It's okay.
It's okay, Marcel.

481
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:51,674
我真该把你怯懦的心脏挖出来
I should rip out your coward heart.

482
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:52,832
怎么，蕾贝卡？
Why, Rebekah?

483
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:54,239
我们说好要除掉你哥哥
We made a deal
to take out your brother

484
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,642
但人终归要为自己着想
but at the end of the day,
it's every man for himself.

485
00:31:56,814 --> 00:32:01,251
我受够了这种自私的自恋狂
I am so sick
of self-serving narcissists.

486
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,115
难道一个人就不能忠于盟友吗？
Are men simply incapable
of committing to an alliance?

487
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,451
我告诉过你别搞小动作对付家人
I asked you to cease
these petty moves

488
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:14,757
但你还是跟这个傻瓜一起密谋策画
against our family,
and yet you conspire with this fool.

489
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,331
这就是你的目的吗？
Is this what it's come to you?

490
00:32:17,502 --> 00:32:18,969
对付你的亲哥哥？
Making moves
against your own blood?

491
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,162
别想羞辱我
Don't you try and shame me.

492
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,806
尼克日渐强大
Nik grows more powerful by the day

493
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:24,373
你什么都不做却还鼓励他
and you do nothing
but encourage him.

494
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,066
我给他提出了建议，因为对我来说
I offer him my counsel
because it's clear to me

495
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,212
显然他想把这个城市变成我们的家园
that he means
to make the city our home.

496
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:34,574
也许，领导着这些废物
能够控制住这些冲动
Now, perhaps leading these derelicts
will curb some of these impulses,

497
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:36,219
能给予他某种程度的幸福
grant him some degree of happiness.

498
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,446
你总是说着尼克的幸福
You always talk of Nik's happiness.

499
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:42,024
这一千年来，他剥夺了我所有
得到幸福的机会
But for 1,000 years, he has robbed me
of any chance at my own.

500
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:46,323
那我呢，以利亚？
你就不关心我吗？
What about me, Elijah?
Am I not a concern for you?

501
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:49,159
以这个家族的名义
我们都有所牺牲，蕾贝卡
We all make sacrifices
in the name of this family, Rebekah,

502
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:52,997
但你要知道
我绝对不会与你或尼克劳斯作对
but know this. I will never stand
against you or Niklaus.

503
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:54,900
那海莉呢？
What about Hayley?

504
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,531
我密谋任何事
Nothing I conspire to do,

505
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,574
我的任何背叛，都比不上你对她的感情
none of my treachery
will harm this family

506
00:32:59,744 --> 00:33:01,507
给我们家族造成的伤害
as much as your feelings for her.

507
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:07,280
你就是个伪君子，以利亚
You're a hypocrite, Elijah.

508
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,079
在爱情和家人之间你选了前者
You would choose love over family

509
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,653
却谴责我做了同样的选择
and then condemn me
for doing the same.

510
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,496
很高兴在这里见到你
Fancy meeting you here.

511
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,507
那个符号已经遍布女巫区了
That symbol is already up
and down the cauldron,

512
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,338
到处都出现了这些符号
more of them popping up everywhere.

513
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,844
我猜图德巫父在圈划领土了
I suppose Papa Tunde
is marking his territory.

514
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:42,275
- 我听说你也看到他了
- 是的
-I'm told you saw him as well.
-Yeah.

515
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,787
- 勾起了许多回忆
- 最好被埋葬的回忆
-Brought up a lot of memories.
-Memories that are best left buried.

516
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,907
你喝醉了
REBEKAH: You're sauced.

517
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,814
庆祝克劳斯打败了疯狂的图德巫父？
Celebrating Klaus' defeat
of the mad Papa Tunde?

518
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,584
不是庆祝，是在借酒浇愁
Not celebrating, drowning sorrows.

519
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:29,496
是我把图德带来这里的
I'm the one
who brought Tunde to town.

520
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,135
什么？
What?

521
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,335
我在海外时四处打听了一下
I made some inquiries
while I was abroad,

522
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,106
想找一个极其危险的巫师
I wanted the most dangerous witch
anyone could find.

523
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,342
- 你为什么要那么做？
- 为了你
-Why on earth would you do that?
-For you.

524
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:51,318
我想如果有像图德这样的狠角色来
I figured if someone as bad
as Tunde comes in,

525
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,423
也许克劳斯就会被赶走
maybe Klaus gets chased off.

526
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,425
至少他就会无暇抽身
Very least, he's occupied enough

527
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,824
来阻止我再次得到你
that he can't stop me
from trying to get you back.

528
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,165
你是想告诉我你要摧毁
You mean to tell me
that you would tear down

529
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:07,202
我的家族建立的一切
你帮助我们建立的一切
everything my family built,
everything you helped us build,

530
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,896
拿自己的性命冒险
risk your own life...

531
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,975
就为了那一丝我会对你表现
...on the off chance
that I would show you

532
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,839
一点点喜爱之情的可能？
the slightest bit of affection?

533
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:20,780
我愿意
我也这么做了
I would. I did.

534
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,013
我愿意再做一次
I'd do it again.

535
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:32,521
克劳斯杀死过上千个像图德这样的人
Klaus has killed a thousand Tundes.

536
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:36,189
他这一生只真正害怕过一个人
All his life, there's only ever been
one man he has truly feared,

537
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:39,165
我的父亲麦可
my father, Mikael.

538
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,464
那个追杀吸血鬼的吸血鬼
The vampire who hunts vampires.

539
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,040
如果他来到这里
克劳斯一定会逃走，并永远不再回来
If he came here, Klaus would flee
and never turn back.

540
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,308
我们只需要一个能帮我们找到他的女巫
All we need is a witch
who can help us find him.

541
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,912
不久前，你们联合起来对付我
Not long ago,
you all united against me.

542
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,174
你们失败了
You failed.

543
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:06,415
从那时起，因为我的仁慈
过去的恩怨就一笔勾销了
Since then, in my benevolence,
I have wiped the slate clean.

544
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,083
然而似乎你们觉得，我才是那个
Yet, it seems clear
you think that I am the one

545
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:13,924
需要赢得你们的尊重和忠诚的人
who needs to earn your respect,
your loyalty.

546
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:15,326
你们错了
You're mistaken.

547
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:19,595
是你们必须向我证明自己
It is you who must
prove yourselves to me.

548
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,365
我们的社区正遭受攻击
Our community is under attack.

549
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,668
我需要士兵
I require soldiers.

550
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:30,280
我需要勇士而非懦夫
I need warriors, not cowards.

551
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,747
你们好好做决定吧
Each of you has a decision to make.

552
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,253
要么和我并肩作战
You either fight alongside me

553
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:43,621
要么现在就离开
or you leave now.

554
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,467
我们什么都不欠你
We don't owe you anything!

555
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,610
如果留在法语区意味着
要生活在你的掌控之下
If staying in the Quarter means
living under your rule,

556
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,578
我会尽快离开这里的
I'd just as soon get the hell out.

557
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,441
我得承认
MARCEL: I got to admit,

558
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,645
我以为你会损失更多人呢
I thought you'd lose
a lot more guys than that.

559
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,086
我说，幸好摆脱他们了
Well, good riddance to them, I say.

560
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,954
我们的王国容不下懒汉懦夫
We've no room for slackers
or cowards in our kingdom.

561
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,329
既然你恢复了冷静
Now that you've regained
your composure,

562
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,300
我们就继续下个事项，好吗？
Iet's move on to the next item
of business, shall we?

563
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:05,272
有我们亲爱的朋友苏菲的小小帮忙
With a little help
from our dear friend, Sophie.

564
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,876
我没理由帮你
I got no reason to help you

565
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,636
我也绝对没理由帮他
and I sure as hell
don't have a reason to help him.

566
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,213
别这么难搞嘛，亲爱的
KLAUS: Now, now, don't be difficult, love.

567
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,247
你对我有用处才能继续活着
You'll only live as long
as you're of use to me,

568
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,385
而现在，你最大的用处就是解释
and right now,
your best use is to explain

569
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:20,047
为什么一个一百年前被我杀死的巫师
又回来复仇了
why a witch I killed 100 years ago
has come back for revenge.

570
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:23,785
拜托
拥有强大力量的复活巫师？
SOPHlE: Come on.
Resurrected witches with vast power?

571
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,721
是收获祭
It's the Harvest.

572
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:30,025
四个女孩照理应该死而复活
Four girls were meant to die
and be reborn.

573
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:33,227
我不知道怎么做的
但有人劫走了那力量
I don't know how
but someone jacked that power

574
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:36,840
然复利用它复活了四个巫师
and they used it
to bring back four witches.

575
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,002
只不过不是那四个女孩
Just not the right ones.

576
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,371
所以还有机会
So there's still a chance.

577
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,877
如果我们能够夺回力量，就能救黛维娜
If we can get that power back,
we can save Davina.

578
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,243
我们先把注意力集中在现有的问题上
Let's concentrate
on the immediate problem, shall we?

579
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,352
图德巫父想要复仇
Papa Tunde wants revenge.

580
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,010
他还会攻击我们
He'll continue to attack us,

581
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:53,452
利用他献祭的吸血鬼的力量
channeling power
from the vampires he sacrifices.

582
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,024
他杀的越多，就会变得越危险
He kills, he grows more dangerous.

583
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:59,356
我要怎么阻止他？
So, how do I end him?

584
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,260
他需要献祭来获得力量
He needs sacrifices to gain power.

585
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,499
不让他杀死更多的夜行者
You keep him from killing
any more nightwalkers,

586
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,659
就是个好的开始
that's a start.

587
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,396
除非
Unless...

588
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,769
他已经找到了一个地方
那里满是吸血鬼
...he finds the one place
with a load of vampires

589
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:16,674
随时可以被献祭
ready to be sacrificed.

590
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,504
完成了吗？
Is it done?

591
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,181
这把刀现在包含着
This blade now contains

592
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,613
我从吸血鬼身上收获的力量
all the power I harvested
from the vampires.

593
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,654
它能做到的，是比死亡更可怕的事情
即使是对吸血鬼真祖
It will do things worse than death,
even to an Original.

594
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:05,323
你准备好最后的献祭了吗？
And are you ready
for the final offering?

595
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,262
以法语区女巫之名
In the name of the witches
of the French Quarter,

596
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,367
这是我的荣幸
it is my honor.

597
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:27,573
谢谢你，图德巫父
Thank you, Papa Tunde.

598
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,966
