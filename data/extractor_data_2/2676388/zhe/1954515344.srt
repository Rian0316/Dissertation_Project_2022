<i>孩子们  你们可能还记得</i>
<i>Kids, early in this story,</i>

14
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,370
<i>我曾在故事开头说过类似这种话</i>
<i> you may recall me saying something along the lines of...</i>

15
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,480
好了  再也不谈恋爱了
Okay, no more dating.

16
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,310
我已经准备好安定下来
I am ready to settle down.

17
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,910
<i>当时  还真以为自己是发自肺腑的</i>
<i>And at the time, I probably thought I meant it.</i>

18
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,830
<i>不过  孩子们  说实话</i>
<i>But, kids, I'll be honest.</i>

19
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,260
<i>单身真是太欢乐了</i>
<i>Being single's fun.</i>

20
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,610
<i>做为一名纽约的年轻单身汉</i>
<i>As a young unattached man in New York City,</i>

21
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,170
<i>我过得精彩极了</i>
<i>I had a great time.</i>

22
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,850
<i>真心精彩啊</i>
<i>A great time.</i>

23
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>说到哪了</i>
<i>What was I saying? </i>

24
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,400
<i>对哦</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

25
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,100
<i>我过得精彩极了  直到出现一个很特别的人</i>
<i>I had such a great time that it took someone very special </i>

26
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,980
<i>才让我有了安定下来的想法</i>
<i>to make me want to settle down.</i>

27
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,550
<i>而那个特别的人</i>
<i>And that someone...</i>

28
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,880
<i>就是珍妮特</i>
<i>was Jeanette.</i>

29
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,840
<i>珍妮特特别在哪里</i>
<i>What made Jeanette so special? Well...</i>

30
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,620
那是犯规啊
That was a foul!

31
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,170
<i>珍妮特是我遇见你们妈妈之前</i>
<i>Jeanette was the last girl I dated</i>

32
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>最后一个女友</i>
<i>before I met your mother.</i>

33
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,820
<i>那女孩最终让我决定</i>
<i>The girl who finally got me to say...</i>

34
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,760
不再恋爱了
>No more dating.

35
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,400
我准备好安定下来了
I'm ready to settle down.

36
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>发自肺腑的</i>
<i>...and really mean it.</i>

37
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,790
<i>不过时间先往前倒一点</i>
<i>But let's back up a little bit.</i>

38
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,330
她拿酒瓶砸坏了你的电视机
She broke your TV with a beer bottle?

39
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,570
拿她的话说  她本想砸窗户的
In her defense, she was aiming for the window.

40
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,720
老兄  你得甩了这女的
Dude, you gotta get rid of this girl.

41
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
同意  你得在这疯妹妹
Agreed. Cray-cray gotta go bye-bye

42
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,460
拿刀刀捅你前  跟她说拜拜
before you get stab-stabbed.

43
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,290
是吗
Oh, really?

44
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:21,220
你们这么说
And are you guys saying this

45
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,720
是不希望我和珍妮特在一起
because you don't want me to be with Jeanette,

46
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,370
还是不希望我恢复单身
or because you want me to stay single

47
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,480
好让你们继续塞东西过来啊
so you guys can keep your clubhouse?

48
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,640
我控诉[法语]
J'accuse!

49
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>我不是无的放矢  他们也心知肚明</i>
<i>I had a point, and they knew it.</i>

50
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,600
<i>2013年初</i>
<i>You see, in early 2013,</i>

51
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,930
<i>那时就我一人还单着</i>
<i>I was the only single guy in the group.</i>

52
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,430
<i>这就意味着只要马修和巴尼买了</i>
<i>Which meant whenever Marshall or Barney bought something</i>

53
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,830
<i>伴侣不准他们放家里的东西...</i>
<i>they weren't allowed to keep in their apartments...</i>

54
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,150
话说  泰德  这让我想起来
You know what, Ted? That reminds me.

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,320
我刚买了个瑞士古董钟
I just bought this antique Swiss clock,

56
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,920
不过罗宾不让放家里
but Robin won't let us put it in the apartment,

57
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
于是我就打算放你这了
so I was gonna leave it at your place.

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,790
不过有个问题是  它坏了
Only problem? It's broken.

59
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,420
所以我会坐这  试着修好它
So I was just gonna sit here and try to fix it

60
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,790
你也可以顺便说昨晚和珍妮特做了什么
while maybe you tell us what you and Jeanette did last night?

61
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,050
好吧  珍妮特是玛丽莲・梦露的脑残粉
Okay. Well, uh, Jeanette is a big Marilyn Monroe fan.

62
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,440
可以了[听到了吧]  能叫唤了
There you go! Now it's working!

63
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,440
布谷鸟声也可以形容别人白痴  疯子

64
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,570
抱歉  继续说  她是玛丽莲・梦露的粉丝
Sorry. Sorry. Go on. Go on. She's a Marilyn Monroe fan

65
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,190
我猜你俩一起看了她的电影吗
so I guess you watched one of her movies?

66
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,670
没有  我们召唤了她的亡灵
Uh, No, we had a seance.

67
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,060
瞧[听他说的]  跟新的一样
Look at that! Good as new.

68
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,830
然后呢  你们跟异度空间的玛丽莲
Anyway, were you able to contact Marilyn

69
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,880
通上话了吗
in the spirit world?

70
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,540
没  我们跟她的猫通上话了
No. We talked to her cat.

71
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,360
螺丝松了[脑子坏了]  问题找到了
Screw loose! That's the problem.

72
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,610
貌似有人肚子饿了
Looks like somebody's hungry.

73
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,990
我去给他弄吃的
I'm gonna get his food ready.

74
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,650
罗宾  你能把他抱起来吗
Robin, can you grab him?

75
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,090
我能吗  真是求之不得啊
Can I? Try and stop me!

76
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,450
<i>孩子们  莉莉没有意识到</i>
<i>Now, kids, what Lily didn't realize--</i>

77
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,070
<i>其实我们都没意识到</i>
<i>what none of us realized, in fact-- </i>

78
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,200
<i>你们的堂兄马文出生了八个月之久</i>
<i>was that in the eight months since your cousin Marvin was born,</i>

79
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,220
<i>罗宾还一次都没抱过他呢</i>
<i>Robin had never once held him.</i>

80
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,410
<i>事实上  她想到抱他就怕</i>
<i>The truth was, the thought of holding him terrified her,</i>

81
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,680
<i>因此她一直在不着痕迹地回避 </i>
<i>so she had always avoided it, ever so discreetly.</i>

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,200
-你能抱着...  -该死  瞧啊
- Can you hold... - Oh, shoot! Look at that!

83
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,850
天哪
Oh, geez.

84
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,030
我来抱
I got him.

85
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,760
来啊  小乖乖
Come here, you little munchkin.

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,060
老兄
Aw, man...

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,070
那下次我来
Oh, well, I call next.

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,220
我该走了  珍妮特的非常时间到了
Well, I should go. It's time for Jeanette's... something.

89
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,480
珍妮特的什么非常时间  泰德
Time for Jeanette's what, Ted?

90
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,940
我们要带她的狗狗去驱魔人那
Uh, we're taking her dog to an exorcist.

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,490
泰德  那听起来...
Wow, Ted, that sounds...

92
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,750
该死[真扯淡]  这回是真坏了
Crap, it's really broken now.

93
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,240
好吧  好吧  我承认  她疯疯癫癫的
Okay, fine. I admit it. She's crazy.

94
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,260
这明摆着的
Obviously.

95
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,790
但我又不是要跟她过一辈子
But I'm not in this for the long haul.

96
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,790
现在只是好玩而已
It's just, you know, it's just fun.

97
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,430
一开始的确好玩
Of course it's fun, at first.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,430
不过在翻云覆雨时  她开始喊她
But then when she starts calling out the name of her

99
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,150
高中理科老师的名字时
high school science teacher in the throes of passion,

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,750
就更好玩了
it's really fun.

101
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,290
然后她把刀带到床上
But then when she starts bringing knives into bed

102
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,750
害你为自身安全担惊受怕是
and making you fear for your safety?

103
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,700
那更是好玩到不行啊
It's really, really fun.

104
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,240
再后来她逼你在高速上蒙着眼睛开车时
But then when she starts unbuttoning your pants

105
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,520
还一边要解开你的裤子
while you're being forced to drive blindfolded

106
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,650
并拿枪指着你的...
down the freeway with a gun pointed at your...

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,490
不好意思  我们在聊什么来着
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

108
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,730
珍妮特
Jeanette.

109
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,210
对哦  那女孩是个疯子
Oh, right. That girl's crazy.

110
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,490
你得跟她分手
You gotta break up with her.

111
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,870
我知道  你们是对的  我应该跟她分手
I know. I know. You're right. I-I have to break up with her.

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,830
不过我得在公共场合分手
I should do it in a public place, though,

113
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,570
以免她失控
so she doesn't flip out.

114
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,640
<i>于是第二天晚上  我和她约在公共场所</i>
<i>So the next night, I met her in a public place</i>

115
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,910
<i>以免她失控</i>
<i>so she wouldn't flip out.</i>

116
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,330
我要杀了你  裁判
I will kill you, ref!

117
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,630
我要当着这么多人面把你碎尸万段
I will kill you in front of all these people!

118
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,360
老天啊
Oh, boy.

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,890
怎么  你以为我在这么多人面前就不敢吗
What, you think I won't just 'cause I'm in a public place?!

120
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,090
老娘豁出去了  下半辈子坐牢也愿意
I'll go to jail for the rest of my life if I have to!

121
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,550
比赛开始前  我想跟你谈谈
Listen, before the game starts, I think we need to talk.

122
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,220
真不敢相信泰德死了
I can't believe Ted's dead.

123
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,220
就是啊
I know.

124
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,210
死得真惨啊
What a way to go.

125
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,680
被火箭筒给爆了
Killed by a bazooka.

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,750
行了行了  我心情不好打得差嘛
All right, all right, so I'm not on my game today.

127
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,160
我昨晚刚跟人分手嘛
I did just break up with someone last night.

128
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,420
总之
Anyway...

129
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,480
我出去溜达一会
I gotta hop out for a bit.

130
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,910
你们待在这
You guys stay here.

131
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,540
如果珍妮特来了
Oh, and, um, if Jeanette comes by,

132
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,680
千万别让她进来
do not let her into the apartment.

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,100
别让她进来  收到
Don't let her in. Got it.

134
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,980
伙计们  我是认真的  这女的就跟臭虫一样
Guys, this is serious. This girl is like bedbugs.

135
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,840
一旦进来了  赶都赶不走啊
Once she's in the apartment, there's no getting her out.

136
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,340
泰德老兄
Ted, buddy,

137
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,760
我们一起合力对付
how long have we been dealing with

138
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,510
巴尼的疯女友们多少年了  好多年了吧
Barney's insane girlfriends? Years.

139
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,040
历时近十年
Nigh on a decade!

140
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,130
我都五度出席听证会  指证被告精神失常
I had to testify in five competency hearings.

141
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,010
我认为我们对付珍妮特绰绰有余
I think we can handle Jeanette.

142
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,930
好吧  好吧
Okay, okay.

143
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,500
回见
See you soon.

144
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
嫩着呢  是吧
That kid. Am I right?

145
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,520
肯定是忘了带钥匙了
Now look who forgot his keys.

146
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,700
是谁
What is it?

147
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,040
<i>与此同时  莉莉和罗宾去外面吃午饭</i>
<i>Meanwhile, Lily and Robin were out getting lunch,</i>

148
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,430
<i>一场灾难降临了</i>
<i>when disaster struck.</i>

149
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,930
天啊  我把他的奶嘴落公车上了
Oh, God, I left his binky on that bus!

150
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,480
等等  你没有其他奶嘴了吗
Wait. Don't you have other binkies?

151
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,760
那是他最爱的奶嘴  他分辨得出来
That one's his favorite! He'll know the difference!

152
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,250
我不会让他因为这事
I'm not gonna let this be the reason

153
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,890
而记恨我一辈子
he resents me later in life!

154
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,970
他一哭  就把他抱起来
If he starts crying, just pick him up!

155
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,270
什么
What? Uh, uh...

156
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,150
好好  不哭  不哭  乖乖
Okay, okay. Yeah, there, there, there. Okay.

157
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,530
我回来了  有发生什么事吗
Hey, I'm back. Did I miss anything?

158
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,600
没有
Nope.

159
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,130
珍妮特来过吗
Did Jeanette come by?

160
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,140
哪个珍妮特  我认识好多珍妮特
Jeanette? I know lots of Jeanettes.

161
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,100
伙计们
Guys!

162
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,290
好吧  她来过  她把书落这了
Okay, she came by because she forgot her book.

163
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,760
于是我们让她进你房间拿了
So we let her go up in your room and get it.

164
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,290
然后呢
And then?

165
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,260
然后什么
And then what?

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
然后她走了吗
And then she left?

167
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,120
我想她走了吧
I think she left.

168
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,120
你确定她走了吗
Are you sure she left?

169
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,200
我...
I am...

170
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,260
90%确信她走了
90% sure... that she left.

171
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,270
80%
80 percent.

172
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,080
事实上  我要重新回答这个问题
Actually, I'm gonna change my answer.

173
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,830
我现在觉得她没走
I am now starting to think she never left,

174
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,240
而且她还把自己关在你的房间了
and instead she barricaded herself in your room.

175
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,550
我永远都不会出来的
And I'm never coming out!

176
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,250
百分百确定了
A hundred percent.

177
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,530
你们俩不是吧
I cannot believe you guys!

178
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,890
谁让你事先没提醒过我们她是疯妹子
Well, maybe if you had given us a warning that she was crazy!

179
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,540
兄弟  没事啦
Dude, it's okay.

180
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,200
她不可能永远待在里面的
She can't stay in there forever.

181
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,650
她总得出来吃喝啊
She'll have to come out to eat and drink

182
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,190
或者上厕所  对吧
and go to the bathroom, right?

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,490
<i>几个月以前</i>
<i>Now, a few months earlier,</i>

184
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,100
<i>东海岸曾遭到暴风雨袭击</i>
<i>the East Coast had been hit by a bad storm,</i>

185
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,580
<i>于是某些聪明过人  富有远见的纽约人</i>
<i>and some intelligent, forward-thinking New Yorkers </i>

186
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,190
<i>视其为醒世警钟</i>
<i>took it as a wake-up call,</i>

187
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,650
<i>确保自己卧室里储存了</i>
<i>making sure to stock their bedrooms </i>

188
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,050
<i>足够维持好几个月的食物和饮用水</i>
<i>with enough food and water to last months,</i>

189
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,880
<i>当然还有一个便携式排泄物处理装置</i>
<i>not to mention a portable waste management system.</i>

190
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,970
<i>这些措施实在是聪明之举</i>
<i>It was really the smart thing to do.</i>

191
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,640
你个大呆瓜
You dumbass!

192
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,450
真的  泰德  你怎么能笨到如此不可救药呢
Really, Ted. How could you be so unbelievably stupid?

193
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,360
才怪  是你们笨蛋把
No, no, you guys are the ones

194
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
那个吸血魔女请到我卧室的
who invited a vampire into my apartment!

195
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,870
这都是你们的错
This is your fault!

196
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,980
随带一提  如果今天我们遇到是超强暴风雨
And P.S., if this disaster had been a superstorm

197
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,440
而不是什么性感女魔头
instead of a hot lunatic,

198
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,590
你们俩绝对会苦苦哀求  要我给冷冻蛋白酱吃
you'd all be begging to eat my freeze-dried protein paste

199
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,430
要我给生化垃圾桶排便  
and crap in my biohazard bucket. Just sayin'.

200
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,580
我找到了
I got it.

201
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,460
落在公车的地板上了
It was on the floor of the bus.

202
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,750
我应该直接丢掉算了
I should probably throw it out.

203
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,580
他没出什么问题吧
Did he give you any problems?

204
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,560
小小哭了一下  然后就没事了
He cried a little, but then he stopped.

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,480
太好了  没出其他什么事吧
Oh, good. Anything else happen?

206
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,040
没有
Nope.

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,490
仅此而已
That... is... it.

208
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,460
4年后

209
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,270
喝光了
All gone!

210
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,970
我们真该经常这样
We have to do this more often.

211
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,780
完全同意
Oh, we totally do.

212
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,960
真不敢相信马文都读幼儿园了
I can't believe Marvin's in kindergarten.

213
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,050
他长得可真快啊
He's growing up so fast.

214
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,710
我可以向你坦白一件事吗
Can I confess something to you?

215
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,490
还记得你把马文的奶嘴忘在巴士上
Remember the day you left Marvin's binky on the bus

216
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,910
-然后让我独自照顾马文的那次吗  -记得
- and you left me alone with him? - Yeah.

217
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,100
我当时没敢把这事告诉你  不过...
Well, I didn't tell you this at the time, but...

218
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,070
好了好了  不哭不哭
Okay, okay. Yeah, there, there, there.

219
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,160
乖乖
Okay, shh, shh.

220
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,740
看来某人很不开心啊
Oh, no, it looks like somebody's not happy.

221
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,750
真的  我超不爽的
No kidding. I'm miserable.

222
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,390
他怎么能哭成这样
Listen to this thing.

223
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,900
他大概只是想要人抱抱吧
He probably just wants to be held.

224
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,420
你说得对
I think you're right.

225
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,650
-你能抱抱他吗  -当然
- Can you do it? - All right.

226
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,160
来让我抱抱  小帅哥
Come here, handsome.

227
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,680
乖乖
Oh. Yeah. Yes.

228
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,420
我让一个陌生人抱了马文  对不起
I let a stranger pick up Marvin. I'm sorry.

229
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,360
我当时没有亲自抱他
It's just, I hadn't actually picked him up at that point,

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,830
我吓坏了  所以...
and I was scared, so...

231
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,380
算了吧  都四年以前的事了
You know what? It was four years ago.

232
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,670
他现在茁壮成长  所以别担心这个了
He's obviously fine. Don't even worry about it.

233
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,240
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

234
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
谢谢
Thank you.

235
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,190
反正除此之外  没别的事发生了吧
I mean, as long as there's not more to that story.

236
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,350
没有  
Nope.

237
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,370
仅此而已
That... is... it.

238
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:49,670
珍妮特  你得离开
Jeanette, you have to leave!

239
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,240
马上  我还没找到我的书呢
In a minute! I still haven't found that book!

240
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,950
听着  珍妮特  我不想做到这个份上
Listen, Jeanette, I didn't want to do this,

241
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,500
但我已经报警了  警察马上就到
but I called the police. They're on their way.

242
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,760
各小组注意  各小组注意 
All units, all units.

243
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,080
521号西街82幢15户需要出警
Possible 10-90 in progress at 521 West 82nd, apartment 15.

244
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
这声音是从哪儿来的
Where's that coming from?

245
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,790
-是你吗  德罗丽斯  -珍妮特  
- Is that you, Dolores? - Jeanette?

246
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,180
妹子  最近过得如何啊
Hey, girl. How you been?

247
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,000
还是原来的老样子啦
Oh, you know, I'm just doing me.

248
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,730
总之  我会去查看那个地址的
Anyway, I'll check out that 10-90.

249
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,930
好的  不过要记住...
Okay, but remember...

250
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,290
我知道  不要过度使用暴力
I know, no excessive force.

251
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,350
我不想要再被停职查看了  对吧
Last thing I need is another suspension, am I right?

252
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,290
<i>孩子们  那个时候我才发现</i>
<i>And that, kids, was how I found out</i>

253
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,160
<i>珍妮特的职业原来是警察</i>
<i>what Jeanette did for a living.</i>

254
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,160
珍妮特・彼得森中尉

255
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,400
等一下
Wait a second.

256
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,180
她是条子吗
Is she a cop?!

257
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,970
我看她是条子哦
I think she's a cop!

258
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,890
你早就知道她是条子了
Did you know she was a cop?!

259
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,760
我根本不知道她是个条子[《无间行者》的哏]
I didn't know she was a cop!

260
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,680
泰德  抱歉地通知你  
Ted, I'm sorry I have to say this--

261
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,670
这里现在是珍妮特的家了  是她的地盘
Jeanette lives here now. This is her place.

262
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,920
-你赶快离开吧  -什么
- You're gonna have to leave. - What?

263
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,660
那你们怎么不离开呢
Why don't you have to leave?

264
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,000
他们可以留下来
They can stay.

265
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,700
-谢了  珍妮特警官  -谢了  珍妮特警官
- Thank you, Officer Jeanette. - Thank you, Officer Jeanette.

266
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,000
12年后

267
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:50,260
又喝完了
All gone.

268
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,690
我们真该经常这样
We need to do this more often.

269
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,270
完全同意  真不敢相信马文已经上初中了
We totally do. I can't believe marvin's in middle school.

270
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,340
他长得可真快啊
Oh, he's growing up so fast.

271
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,810
我可以向你坦白一件事吗
Can I confess something to you?

272
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,950
还记得你把马文的奶嘴忘在巴士上
Remember that day you left Marvin's binky on the bus

273
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,560
然后我让个陌生老太太抱他的事吗
and I let that old lady pick him up?

274
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,560
我记得事情应该就这么简单吧
I seem to recall that was the entire story.

275
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,440
其实我还剩一点没说完
There's a little bit more.

276
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,650
不哭不哭  小乖乖
There, there, little one.

277
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,290
我把你放回你的小车车
Let's put you back in your strolly-poo,

278
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,890
这样你就能慢慢飘向梦梦园
so you can drift off to dreamy-dreamy land.

279
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,410
真是太谢谢你了
Oh, thank you so much.

280
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,030
这是我第一次和他单独在一起
Yeah, this is my first time alone with him,

281
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,710
我一直忐忑不安  觉得我会
and, you know, um, I have this weird feeling that I'm gonna,

282
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,180
我会把他掉地下  或是害他受伤
I don't know, like, drop him or injure him in some way,

283
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,300
我可真是杞人忧天
which is completely insane.

284
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,670
-不过  -天啊
- But... - Oh, heavens.

285
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,320
妈呀
Oh, my God!

286
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,440
我的天呀
Oh, my God.

287
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,390
我真的真的很抱歉
I know, I'm so sorry.

288
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,880
算了
Well, you know what?

289
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,250
那已经是12年前的事了
That was what, 12 years ago?

290
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,740
别为这事担心了
Don't even worry about it.

291
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,910
-真的吗  -真的
- Really? - Yeah.

292
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,310
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

293
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,020
答应我  除此之外没其他事情发生了吧
Just promise me there's no more to that story.

294
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,220
没有  仅此而已
Nope, that is it.

295
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,740
你真的要这么做吗
Are you sure you want to do this?

296
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,950
那姑娘可是警察呢
The girl's a cop.

297
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,920
真的  这主意看起来很不妙
Yeah, this seems like a really bad idea.

298
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,020
我不管了
I don't care.

299
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,390
我要冲进我的卧室
I am going into that bedroom

300
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:04,060
因为这里是我家
because this is my home

301
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,280
我必须拼死保卫它
and I have to defend it.

302
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,830
但最主要的原因是
But mostly because

303
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,050
人家的抗过敏药都放在里面呢
my allergy medication is in there!

304
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,790
好吧  总之一切小心  好吗
All right, just be careful, okay?

305
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,650
那个姑娘真是个疯妹子
This girl is really crazy.

306
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,320
对啊  她怎么就不能接受
Yeah, why can't she just accept

307
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,820
你们分手的事实呢
the fact that you guys broke up?

308
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,590
我也觉得  她怎么就不能好好接受呢
I know, I know, why can't she just accept that?

309
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,890
为什么  到底是为什么啊
Why, it's, like, why?

310
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,300
也许是因为我们其实还没有分手吧
It might be because we didn't actually break up.

311
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,510
拜托  珍妮特  那可是我的珍藏黑胶唱片啊
Aw, man. Jeanette, come on, that's vintage vinyl.

312
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,370
泰德  昨天晚上你到底有没有
Ted, did you or didn't you break up

313
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,920
和珍妮特分手
with Jeanette last night?

314
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,170
我不知道  状况有点混乱
I don't know, it's kind of confusing.

315
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,170
我们需要谈一谈
I think we need to talk.

316
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,760
哦  好呀
Oh, oh, okay.

317
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,600
我知道你要说什么了
I see where this is going.

318
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,650
你爱上了莉莉是吧
You're in love with Lily.

319
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,980
你是要说这个吧  对不对
That's it, isn't it?

320
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,210
什么  不  我
What? No, I...

321
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,150
想到她光鲜的医学文凭和性感的南方口音
Like I should be surprised with her fancy medical degree

322
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,370
我早就该料到了
and her sexy Southern drawl.

323
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,610
什么  她不是...
What? She's not...

324
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,670
别跟我说话  别看我
Don't talk to me, don't look at me.

325
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,710
我恨你  我再也不要见到你了
I hate you and I never want to see you again!

326
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,860
接下来的事一发不可收拾
And then things got crazy

327
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,180
我们被赶出了巴克莱中心
and we got thrown out of the Barclays Center.

328
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,470
我觉得这就算是分手了吧
I don't know, it felt pretty breakup-y.

329
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,140
总之
Anyway,

330
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,440
当时我们不欢而散  所以...
we parted on pretty bad terms, so...

331
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,290
我以为也许我可以借此...
I kind of thought maybe I could...

332
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,380
再不和她联系  希望她能意识到这点
Never contact her again and hope she'd take the hint

333
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,790
从此再也不来打扰你吗
and just leave you alone?

334
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,330
巴尼  别把我想得这么烂
Barney, give me some credit.

335
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,970
-那这是你的计划吗  -正是
- Was that the plan? - Yes.

336
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,330
14年后

337
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,700
-喝完了  -我们真该经常这样
- All gone. - We need to do this more often.

338
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,250
完全同意
We totally do.

339
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,540
真不敢相信马文都读高中了
I can't believe Marvin's in high school.

340
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,830
他长得可真快啊
He's growing up so fast.

341
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,980
-我可以向你坦白一件事吗  -又来了  什么事
- Can I confess something to you? - Oh, no. What?

342
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,950
到底发生了什么事
What happened?

343
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,090
告诉我你把我儿子到底怎么了
Tell me what you did to my son.

344
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,870
真是太不顺利了
This is not going well at all.

345
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,550
亲爱的  你浑身发抖
Oh, honey, you are shaking.

346
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,340
咱们找个暖和的地方
Let's get you out of the cold.

347
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,170
这附近有什么店吗
What's open near here?

348
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,660
你带着我家婴儿去脱衣舞俱乐部了
You took my infant child to a strip club?

349
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,190
只是露两点而已
It was just topless.

350
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,160
反正他在家也老看你的啊
He saw yours all the time anyway.

351
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,490
好了  对不起  我不该带他去那里
Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that,

352
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,010
但全部经过就是这样
but that is all there is.

353
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,440
真的没有什么要补充的了
Okay, there is no more to the story.

354
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,460
我把全部经过都告诉你了
I have now told you everything.

355
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,350
16年后

356
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,880
喝光了
All gone.

357
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,470
我们真该经常这样
We need to do this more often.

358
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,930
完全同意  真不敢相信马文已经会开车了
We totally do. I can't believe Marvin's driving.

359
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,360
他长得可真快啊
He's growing up so fast.

360
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,420
-好吧  还有一件事  -又怎么了
- Okay, there's one other thing. - What?

361
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,700
我得去下洗手间
Well, I have to go use the ladies' room.

362
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,750
你能帮我照看他一下吗
Can you watch him for me?

363
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,860
当然没问题
Of course.

364
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,200
真想把你一口吞下去
I could just eat you up.

365
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,770
你把他交给一个完全陌生的人
You left him with a complete stranger?

366
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,940
他可能被...
He could've been...

367
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,290
罗宾  你怎么能这样
Robin, how could you?

368
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:36,240
莉莉  拜托  这是16年前的事了
Lily, please, okay, it was 16 years ago.

369
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,640
他没事
He's fine.

370
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,460
你说的对
You're right.

371
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,620
没事
It's fine.

372
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,600
老天  能彻底坦白的感觉真是太好了
God, it feels so good to have gotten this off my chest.

373
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,520
我终于鼓足勇气说出一切
Finally it is all on the table.

374
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,920
所有秘密都坦白了
All secrets are exposed

375
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,540
再也没有好隐瞒的了
and there is nothing left to be revealed.

376
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,410
17年后

377
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,290
-又喝光了  -我们真该经常...
- All gone.  We need to do this more...

378
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,910
-其实我还没说完  -见鬼  罗宾
- There's more to the story. - Damn it, Robin.

379
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,290
你到底还有什么没告诉我
What could you possibly have left out?

380
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,920
只是有
It's just there's, um,

381
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,520
一个小细节  我稍微修改了一下
one little detail that I may have slightly altered.

382
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,790
如果他哭  就把他抱起来
If he starts crying, just pick him up.

383
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,000
乖乖  别哭
Yeah, there, there.

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,970
配合点  小家伙
Come on, buddy, shh.

385
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,900
看来有人不开心啊
Looks like somebody's unhappy.

386
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,450
真的  我超不爽的
No kidding, I'm miserable.

387
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,680
他怎么能哭成这样
Listen to this thing.

388
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,510
他大概只是想要人抱抱吧
Maybe he needs to be held.

389
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,900
你说得对
I think you're right.

390
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,620
你能抱抱他吗  
Can you do it?

391
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,950
当然
Sure.

392
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,990
过来  小帅哥
Come here, handsome.

393
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,820
过来过来  你这个帅气的小家伙
Come here, come here, you handsome devil, you.

394
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,680
你长得真漂亮啊
You're such a beautiful...

395
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,440
真是个酷小伙
Aw, you're such a cool dude.

396
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,840
瞧你
Oh, look at you, oh.

397
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,750
好了  乖了不哭  小家伙  乖乖
All right, there, there, little one, there, there.

398
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,260
我把你放回你的小车车
Let me put you back in your strolly-poo

399
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,290
这样你就能慢慢飘向梦梦园
so you can drift off to dreamy-dreamy land.

400
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,410
好吗  好了
Okay? All right.

401
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,400
太感谢了
Thank you so much.

402
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,330
别客气
Hey, don't worry about it.

403
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,560
这是我第一次单独和他在一起
It's my first time alone with him,

404
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,540
我一直忐忑不安  
and I just have this weird feeling

405
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,280
觉得我会把他掉地下  或是害他受伤
I'm gonna drop him or injure him in some way.

406
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,330
我可真是杞人忧天
I know it's completely insane...

407
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,780
我的天  小心  不好
Oh, heavens, oh, watch it, no!

408
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,060
不
No!

409
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,760
真是太不顺利了
This is not going well at all.

410
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,110
亲爱的  你浑身发抖
Oh, hon, you're shaking.

411
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,190
咱们找个暖和的地方
Let's get out of the cold.

412
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,070
这附近有什么店吗
Is there anything open near here?

413
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,070
我得去下洗手间
Hey, I need to go to the ladies' room--

414
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,450
你能帮我照看他一下吗
can you watch him for me?

415
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,680
当然没问题  真想把你一口吞下去
Of course. I could just eat you up.

416
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,080
瞧你  怎么这样可耐  好可耐
Look at you, yum, yum, yum, yum.

417
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,190
你隐瞒了17年才告诉我
You waited 17 years to tell me

418
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,650
你曾经碰到了史上最伟大的拳击手
that you met the greatest boxer of all time?

419
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,900
我的儿子曾经被参议员迈克・泰森哄睡着
My son was rocked to sleep by Senator Mike Tyson?

420
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,280
-我想告诉你的  相信我  -你怎么能这样
- I wanted to tell you, believe me. - How could you...?

421
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,300
正确的做法是
Okay, this is the right thing to do.

422
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,180
你上楼去  真正和她分手
You got to go up there and break up with her for real.

423
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,920
别担心  如果有事
And don't worry, if anything happens,

424
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,880
尖叫就行  我们会去救你的
just scream, we'll come rescue you.

425
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:41,200
好的
Okay.

426
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,970
5分钟后

427
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,840
你们没听到我在上面尖叫吗
Did you guys not hear me screaming up there?

428
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,690
我觉得好内疚
Aw, I feel so awful.

429
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,010
我们去买赛百味三明治了
We went to get subs.

430
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,330
不过给你也买了一个
We got you one though.

431
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,670
我们没有给你买
We didn't get you one.

432
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,750
这么说你的房间被珍妮特霸占了
So, Jeanette's squatting in your room?

433
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,820
你们怎么来了
What are you guys doing here?

434
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,510
我们在三条街外听到你尖叫
We heard you screaming from three blocks away.

435
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,670
她为什么在房间里
Why is she in there?

436
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,290
莉莉  没有什么"为什么"
Lily, there is no reason why.

437
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,860
这就像问地球为什么是圆的
That's like asking why is the earth round?

438
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,880
为什么早上会出太阳
Why does the sun come up in the morning?

439
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,180
我为什么要工作
What do I do for a living?

440
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,980
有些问题就是注定不该知道答案的
There are some questions we're not meant to know the answer to.

441
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,040
疯妹子是疯子  是因为她们本来就疯
Crazy girls are crazy because they're crazy.

442
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,560
我不认为这么简单
I-I don't think it's quite that simple.

443
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,610
我跟一个朋友说了泰德和珍妮特的事
I was talking to a friend of mine about Ted and Jeanette.

444
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,700
有没搞错  什么朋友
Oh, great, what friend is this?

445
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,110
我认识的一个充满智慧的老太太
Uh, just this wise old lady that I know.

446
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,030
疯狂其实是因为
Here's the thing about crazy.

447
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,380
当一个男的发送模棱两可的信号给妹子时
When a guy sends mixed signals to a girl,

448
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,180
会给她的心理健康造成伤害
it takes a toll on her psychological well-being.

449
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,360
想知道妹子为什么会发疯
You want to know why a girl acts crazy,

450
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,790
瞧她的男朋友就明白了
look at the guy she's dating.

451
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,690
你会看到什么叫真正的疯狂
Then you really see some crazy.

452
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:55,730
相信我
Trust me.

453
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,890
你是迈克・泰森吗
Are you Mike Tyson?

454
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,750
慢着
Now, hold on.

455
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,980
我这辈子约会过数不清的疯妹子
I've dated tons of crazy girls in my life,

456
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,850
我每一次对待她们的方式是...
and not once have I ever treated them with anything other than...

457
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,620
对  我禽兽不如
Oh, right, I'm a monster.

458
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,210
也许脸上有纹身的老太太是对的
Maybe the old lady with the face tattoo is right.

459
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,890
也许珍妮特会这样的原因
Maybe the reason Jeanette's acting this way

460
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,200
就是泰德
is Ted.

461
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,040
我  怎么成了我的错了
Me? How is this my fault?

462
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,900
就是  这可是泰德
Yeah, come on, this is Ted we're talking about.

463
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,950
我相信他没有做什么事误导她
I'm sure he didn't do anything to lead her on

464
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,280
或是发送模棱两可的信号  对吧  泰德
or send mixed signals, right, Ted?

465
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:29,580
别跟我说话  别看我
Don't talk to me, don't look at me.

466
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,560
我恨你  我再也不想看到你了
I hate you and I never want to see you again!

467
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,980
然后我们被赶出了巴克利中心
And we got thrown out of the Barclays Center.

468
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,270
好吧  我失望了
Okay, that's disappointing.

469
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,860
太失望了
So disappointing.

470
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,290
对啊
Seriously.

471
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,410
但那是昨晚的事了  又不是说...
But that was last night. I mean, it's not like...

472
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,650
听着  珍妮特 我们得  
Listen, Jeanette, we really need to

473
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,360
认真谈谈我们的事
have a serious talk about our...

474
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,620
这双靴子是莉莉留在这里的吗
So, did Lily leave these boots here

475
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,690
还是其他贱女人啊
or was it some other bitch?

476
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,190
马修  巴尼  救命
Marshall, Barney, help me!

477
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,320
我想他们不会上来了
I don't think they're coming.

478
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,130
我想也是
I guess not.

479
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,340
都怪那双红靴子
It's those red boots.

480
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,230
谁穿上都是那么性感撩人
They just look sexy on everyone.

481
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,780
泰德  你对这双红靴子有什么情结啊
Okay, Ted, what is with the red boots?

482
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,830
你是个聪明人  你有品味
You're a smart guy, you've got some taste,

483
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,250
你长了眼睛
you got a visual sense, I mean,

484
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,400
你可是个建筑师啊
you're an architect for Pete's sakes.

485
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,280
你怎么能看着那双靴子然后觉得...
How can you look at those boots and think...

486
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,210
我的天  我抱着他  我抱着宝宝
Oh, my God, I'm holding it, I'm holding the baby.

487
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,260
你从来没抱过他吗
What, you've never held him before?

488
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,850
抱过无数次了好吧
Uh, tons of times.

489
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,390
这对我来说可不是什么重大时刻
This-this is not a big moment for me.

490
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,780
太令人激动了
This is exhilarating.

491
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,880
好了  我知道你要说什么
Look, yes, I know what you're gonna say.

492
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,560
我必须和她分手
I have to break up with her.

493
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,160
不  我准备说相反的话
No, I was actually gonna say the opposite.

494
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,630
我认为你现在应该和珍妮特在一起
I think you need to be with Jeanette right now.

495
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,260
因为她就是我的真命天女
Because she's the one.

496
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,530
不  怎么会  绝对不是
No. What? No.

497
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,030
她是个疯子
She's insane.

498
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,940
但我认为现在你也有点疯
But I think you are also a little insane right now.

499
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,410
你应该和你的疯妹子约会一段时间
So I think you need to go be with your crazy girl for a while

500
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,740
然后等到一切热情燃烧殆尽时
and when it all goes down in flames--

501
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,290
我不是在打比方
and I don't mean that figuratively,

502
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,260
我盼望着能真的有一场熊熊大火
I expect there to be actual flames...

503
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,490
<i>还真被她说中了</i>
<i>And there were.</i>

504
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,380
我们会陪着你的  因为我们爱你
...we'll be here for you because we love you.

505
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,220
珍妮特  我想说
Jeanette I just want to say that, uh,

506
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,520
你这样乱翻乱砸我的东西
you going through my stuff like that...

507
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,730
你真的很特别
You are really something special.

508
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,140
我会给莉莉寄一只死动物
I'm gonna send Lily a dead animal in the mail.

509
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,660
我想我真的喜欢上你了
I think I'm falling for you.

510
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,790
我认为我们应该和我的心理医生玩3P
I think we should have a three-way with my therapist.

511
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,030
他70岁了
He's 70.

512
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,850
你戴几号的戒指
What is your ring size?

513
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,470
罗宾
Robin.

514
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,460
已经凌晨三点了
It's 3:00 in the morning.

515
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,540
真的吗
Really?

516
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,600
对  你要不要把他
Yeah, you sure you don't want to just

517
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,640
放进婴儿床  然后回家休息
put him in the crib and, you know, go home?

518
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,480
不用  我没事
No, I'm good.

519
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,220
好吧
Okay.

520
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,430
晚安
Good night.

521
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,420
晚安
Good night.

522
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,800
那是什么味道
What's that smell?

523
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,790
莉莉  莉莉
Lily! Lily!
