I just bought this

in the eight months since your

Robin had never once held him.

<i>The truth was, the thought</i>

95

I should do it

What, you think I won't

114

just 'cause I'm in
a public place?!

115

Wait. Don't you have

That one's his favorite!
He'll know the difference!

I'm not gonna let
this be the reason

because she forgot
her book.

164
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:41,512
So we let her go up

176
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:07,171
Actually, I'm gonna
change my answer.

177
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,406
I am now starting to
think she never left,

178
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:13,627
and instead she barricaded
herself in your room.

179
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:15,379
And I'm never coming out!

180
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:18,349
A hundred percent.

181
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:24,398
I cannot believe
you guys!

182
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:27,762
Well, maybe if you had given us
a warning that she was crazy!

183
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,522
Dude, it's okay.

184
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,358
She can't stay
in there forever.

185
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,911
She'll have to come out
to eat and drink

186
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,579
and go to the bathroom, right?

187
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:37,498
NARRATOR:
<i>Now, a few months earlier,</i>

188
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,100
<i>the East Coast had been hit</i>
<i>by a bad storm,</i>

189
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:42,102
<i>and some intelligent,</i>
<i>forward-thinking</i>

190
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,204
<i>New Yorkers took it</i>

191
00:07:44,206 --> 00:07:46,423
<i>making sure to stock</i>

192
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,674
food and water to last months,

193
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,426
not to mention a portable waste
<i>management system.</i>

194
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:51,828
<i>It was really</i>
<i>the smart thing to do.</i>

195
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,882
You dumbass!

196
00:07:54,884 --> 00:07:58,635
Really, Ted. How could you be so
unbelievably stupid?

197
00:07:58,637 --> 00:08:01,004
No, no, you guys are the ones
who invited

198
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:03,974
a vampire into my apartment!
This is your fault!

199
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,559
And P.S., if this disaster

200
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:08,028
had been a superstorm
instead of a hot lunatic,

201
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,731
you'd all be begging to eat
my freeze-dried protein paste

202
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:13,700
and crap in my biohazard bucket.
Just sayin'.

203
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,768
I got it.

204
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,370
It was on the
floor of the bus.

205
00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:20,023
I should
probably throw it out. Eh.

206
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:22,292
Did he give you any problems?

207
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,745
He cried a little,
but then he stopped.

208
00:08:24,747 --> 00:08:27,965
Oh, good.
Anything else happen?

209
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:29,366
Nope.

210
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,885
That... is... it.

211
00:08:33,855 --> 00:08:35,923
All gone!

212
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:37,641
We have to do this more often.

213
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,226
Oh, we totally do.

214
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,011
I can't believe Marvin's
in kindergarten.

215
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:42,980
He's growing up so fast.

216
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,566
Can I confess something to you?

217
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:49,236
Remember the day you left
Marvin's binky on the bus

218
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,022
and you left me alone with him?
Yeah.

219
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:55,058
Well, I didn't tell you this
at the time, but...

220
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,410
(Marvin crying)

221
00:08:56,412 --> 00:09:00,447
Okay, okay.
Yeah, there, there, there.

222
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,731
Okay, shh, shh.

223
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:05,568
Oh, no, it looks like
somebody's not happy.

224
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,920
No kidding.
I'm miserable.

225
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,188
Listen to this thing.

226
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,091
He probably just wants
to be held.

227
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,676
I think you're right.

228
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,761
Can you do it?

229
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,597
All right.

230
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,582
Come here, handsome. Oh.
Yeah.

231
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,184
(crying stops)
Yes.

232
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,936
Oh.

233
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:25,422
I let a stranger pick up Marvin.
I'm sorry.

234
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,357
It's just, I hadn't actually
picked him up

235
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,226
at that point,
and I was scared, so...

236
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,528
You know what?
It was four years ago.

237
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,865
He's obviously fine.
Don't even worry about it.

238
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,316
Really?
Yeah.

239
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,151
Thank you.

240
00:09:38,153 --> 00:09:41,271
I mean, as long as there's
not more to that story.

241
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:45,409
Nope. That... is... it.

242
00:09:47,445 --> 00:09:49,379
Jeanette, you
have to leave!

243
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,414
JEANETTE:
In a minute!

244
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:52,582
I still haven't
found that book!

245
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:53,783
(loud crashing)

246
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:55,802
Listen, Jeanette,
I didn't want to do this,

247
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,121
but I called the police.
They're on their way.

248
00:09:58,123 --> 00:09:59,806
WOMAN (over radio):
All units, all units.

249
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:01,391
Possible 10-90 in progress

250
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,428
at 521 West 82nd,
apartment 15.

251
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,846
Where's that coming from?

252
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:07,297
Is that you, Dolores?

253
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,349
Jeanette?
Hey, girl. How you been?

254
00:10:09,351 --> 00:10:11,902
Oh, you know, I'm just doing me.

255
00:10:11,904 --> 00:10:14,571
Anyway, I'll check out
that 10-90.

256
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,657
Okay, but remember...

257
00:10:16,659 --> 00:10:18,408
I know, no excessive force.

258
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,078
Last thing I need is another
suspension, am I right? (laughs)

259
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,247
NARRATOR: <i>And that, kids,</i>
<i>was how I found out</i>

260
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,216
what Jeanette did for a living.

261
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,168
Wait a second.

262
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,153
(Boston accent):
Is she a cop?!

263
00:10:30,155 --> 00:10:31,204
(Boston accent):
I think she's a cop!

264
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:32,873
Did you know
she was a cop?!

265
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:35,175
I didn't know
she was a <i>cop!</i>

266
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,595
Ted, I'm sorry I have to say
this-- Jeanette lives here now.

267
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,797
This is her place.
You're gonna have to leave.

268
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:41,798
What?

269
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,849
Why don't you have to leave?

270
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,434
JEANETTE:
They can stay.

271
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:47,521
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.
Thank you, Officer Jeanette.

272
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,673
All gone. (giggles)

273
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,025
We need to do this more often.

274
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,310
We totally do.
I can't believe

275
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:54,811
Marvin's in middle school.

276
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:56,113
Oh, he's growing up so fast.

277
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,282
Can I confess something to you?

278
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,068
Remember that day
you left Marvin's binky

279
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,487
on the bus and I let
that old lady pick him up?

280
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:06,456
I seem to recall
that was the entire story.

281
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,792
There's a little bit more.

282
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,360
There, there, little one.

283
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:13,296
Let's put you back
in your strolly-poo,

284
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,967
so you can drift off
to dreamy-dreamy land.

285
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:20,420
Oh, thank you
so much.

286
00:11:20,422 --> 00:11:22,089
Yeah, this is my first time
alone with him,

287
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,641
and, you know, um, I have this
weird feeling that I'm gonna,

288
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,344
I don't know, like, drop him
or injure him in some way,

289
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:28,979
which is completely insane.

290
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,647
But... (laughs)
Oh, heavens.

291
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:31,815
Oh, my God!

292
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,566
Oh, my God.

293
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,484
I know, I'm so sorry.

294
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,902
Well, you know what?

295
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,321
That was what, 12 years ago?

296
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:39,906
Don't even worry about it.

297
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,158
Really?
Yeah.

298
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,360
Oh, thank you.

299
00:11:43,362 --> 00:11:46,113
Just promise me
there's no more to that story.

300
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:50,167
Nope, that is it.

301
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,903
Are you sure
you want to do this?

302
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,088
The girl's a cop.

303
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,009
Yeah, this seems
like a really bad idea.

304
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,410
I don't care.

305
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,679
I am going into
that bedroom

306
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,131
because this is my home

307
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,433
and I have to defend it.

308
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,218
But mostly because

309
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,086
my allergy medication

310
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,422
is in there!

311
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,090
All right, just
be careful, okay?

312
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,809
This girl is
really crazy.

313
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:19,095
Yeah, why can't she just accept
the fact that you guys broke up?

314
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,982
I know, I know, why can't
she just accept that?

315
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,900
Why, it's, like, why?

316
00:12:23,902 --> 00:12:26,436
(dramatic music plays)

317
00:12:26,438 --> 00:12:29,105
It might be because
we didn't actually break up.

318
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:30,624
(record scratches, music stops)
Aw, man.

319
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:33,577
Jeanette, come on,
that's vintage vinyl.

320
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:40,184
Ted, did you
or didn't you break up

321
00:12:40,284 --> 00:12:41,766
with Jeanette last night?

322
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:44,736
I don't know,
it's kind of confusing.

323
00:12:44,738 --> 00:12:47,089
I think we need to talk.

324
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,491
Oh, oh, okay.

325
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,326
I see where this is going.

326
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,328
You're in love with Lily.

327
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,496
That's it, isn't it?

328
00:12:54,498 --> 00:12:56,381
What? No, I...

329
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:59,117
Like I should be surprised
with her fancy medical degree

330
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,386
and her sexy Southern drawl.

331
00:13:01,388 --> 00:13:02,638
What? She's not...

332
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,256
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

333
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,142
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

334
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,145
And then things got crazy

335
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:12,814
and we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

336
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:16,068
I don't know, it felt
pretty breakup-y.

337
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,969
Mm.
Anyway,

338
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:20,656
we parted on pretty
bad terms, so...

339
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:23,241
I kind of thought maybe
I could...

340
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:24,776
Never contact her again
and hope she'd take

341
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:26,478
the hint and just
leave you alone?

342
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,030
Barney, give me some credit.

343
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:30,582
Was that the plan?
Yes.

344
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:34,119
All gone.
We need to do this more often.

345
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:35,253
We totally do.

346
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:36,538
I can't believe Marvin's
in high school.

347
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,655
He's growing up so fast.

348
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:39,624
Can I confess something to you?
Oh, no. What?

349
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:40,825
What happened?

350
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,961
Tell me what you did to my son.

351
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,848
This is not going
well at all.

352
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,283
Oh, honey, you are shaking.

353
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,935
Let's get you out
of the cold.

354
00:13:49,937 --> 00:13:51,937
What's open near here?

355
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,772
♪

356
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:58,676
You took my infant child
to a strip club?

357
00:13:58,678 --> 00:13:59,895
It was just topless.

358
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,863
He saw yours
all the time anyway.

359
00:14:01,865 --> 00:14:03,799
Okay, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have done that,

360
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,701
but that is all there is.

361
00:14:05,703 --> 00:14:07,402
Okay, there is no more
to the story.

362
00:14:07,404 --> 00:14:09,204
I have now told you everything.

363
00:14:09,206 --> 00:14:11,440
ROBIN:
<i>All gone.</i>

364
00:14:11,442 --> 00:14:13,992
We need to do this more often.
We totally do.

365
00:14:13,994 --> 00:14:15,660
I can't believe
Marvin's driving.

366
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:16,962
He's growing up so fast.

367
00:14:16,964 --> 00:14:18,380
Okay, there's one other thing.

368
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:19,548
What?

369
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:21,666
Well, I have to go use
the ladies' room.

370
00:14:21,668 --> 00:14:23,552
Can you watch him for me?

371
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:24,702
Of course.

372
00:14:24,704 --> 00:14:26,471
I could just eat you up.

373
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:28,056
(laughs)

374
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:30,542
You left him
with a complete stranger?

375
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:31,876
He could've been...

376
00:14:31,878 --> 00:14:33,478
Robin, how could you?
Lily,

377
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,564
please, okay,
it was 16 years ago.

378
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:37,816
He's fine.

379
00:14:37,818 --> 00:14:39,184
You're right.

380
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:41,219
It's fine.
(sighs)

381
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:45,273
God, it feels so good to have
gotten this off my chest.

382
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,442
Finally it is all on the table.

383
00:14:47,444 --> 00:14:50,112
All secrets are exposed
and there is nothing left

384
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:51,663
to be revealed.

385
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:54,116
All gone.
We need to do this more...

386
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:55,867
There's more to the story.
Damn it, Robin.

387
00:14:55,869 --> 00:14:57,869
What could you possibly
have left out?

388
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,422
It's just there's, um,

389
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:05,427
one little detail that
I may have slightly altered.

390
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:07,546
If he starts crying,
just pick him up.

391
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,714
(Marvin crying)

392
00:15:11,717 --> 00:15:13,552
Yeah, there, there.

393
00:15:13,554 --> 00:15:15,470
Come on,
buddy, shh.

394
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:17,522
Looks like
somebody's unhappy.

395
00:15:17,524 --> 00:15:19,191
No kidding, I'm miserable.

396
00:15:19,193 --> 00:15:20,609
Listen to this thing.

397
00:15:20,611 --> 00:15:22,110
Maybe he needs to be held.

398
00:15:22,112 --> 00:15:24,362
I think you're right.

399
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,198
Can you do it?

400
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,566
Sure.

401
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:28,933
Come here, handsome.

402
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,485
Come here, come here,
you handsome devil, you.

403
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,736
(crying stops)
You're such a beautiful...

404
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:33,205
Aw, you're such
a cool dude.

405
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:35,874
Oh, look at you, oh.

406
00:15:35,876 --> 00:15:37,576
All right, there, there,
little one, there, there.

407
00:15:37,578 --> 00:15:39,961
Let me put you back
in your strolly-poo

408
00:15:39,963 --> 00:15:43,114
so you can drift off
to dreamy-dreamy land.

409
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:45,083
Okay? All right.

410
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,134
Thank you so much.

411
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:47,219
Hey, don't worry about it.

412
00:15:47,221 --> 00:15:48,336
It's my first time
alone with him,

413
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,554
and I just have
this weird feeling

414
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:50,839
I'm gonna drop him

415
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:52,007
or injure him in some way.

416
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,175
I know it's completely
insane...

417
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:54,392
Oh, heavens, oh,
watch it, no!

418
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:55,760
(screams): No!

419
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,431
This is not going well at all.

420
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:00,599
(sighs)

421
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,767
Oh, hon, you're shaking.

422
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:03,735
Let's get out
of the cold.

423
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,487
Is there anything open
near here?

424
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:06,822
(sighs)

425
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:08,473
♪

426
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:12,194
Hey, I need to go to the ladies'
room-- can you watch him for me?

427
00:16:12,196 --> 00:16:14,446
Of course.
I could just eat you up.

428
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:16,581
Look at you,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

429
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:20,869
You waited 17 years to tell me

430
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:24,089
that you met the greatest boxer
of all time?

431
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:28,460
My son was rocked to sleep
by Senator Mike Tyson?

432
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,929
I wanted to tell you, believe me.
How could you...?

433
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:33,098
Okay, this is the
right thing to do.

434
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,884
You got to go up there and
break up with her for real.

435
00:16:35,886 --> 00:16:37,669
And don't worry,
if anything happens,

436
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:39,688
just scream,
we'll come rescue you.

437
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,356
Okay.

438
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,525
(laughs)

439
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:02,410
Did you guys not hear me
screaming up there?

440
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,629
Aw, I feel so awful.

441
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:05,797
We went to get subs.

442
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:07,499
We got you one though.

443
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,551
We didn't get you one.

444
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:12,337
So, Jeanette's squatting
in your room?

445
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,955
What are you guys doing here?

446
00:17:13,957 --> 00:17:16,174
We heard you screaming
from three blocks away.

447
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,309
Why is she in there?

448
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,261
Lily, there is no reason why.

449
00:17:19,263 --> 00:17:21,513
That's like asking
why is the earth round?

450
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,381
Why does the sun come up
in the morning?

451
00:17:23,383 --> 00:17:24,849
What do I do for a living?

452
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:27,686
There are some questions we're
not meant to know the answer to.

453
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:30,989
Crazy girls are crazy
because they're crazy.

454
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:33,191
I-I don't think it's
quite that simple.

455
00:17:33,193 --> 00:17:34,359
I was talking

456
00:17:34,361 --> 00:17:36,244
to a friend of mine
about Ted and Jeanette.

457
00:17:36,246 --> 00:17:38,229
Oh, great, what
friend is this?

458
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:42,150
Uh, just this wise
old lady that I know.

459
00:17:42,152 --> 00:17:43,485
Here's the thing
about crazy.

460
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,837
When a guy sends mixed
signals to a girl,

461
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,390
it takes a toll on her
psychological well-being.

462
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:50,926
You want to know why
a girl acts crazy,

463
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,510
look at the guy she's dating.

464
00:17:52,512 --> 00:17:54,412
Then you really see some crazy.

465
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:56,348
Trust me.

466
00:17:57,633 --> 00:18:00,435
Are you Mike Tyson?

467
00:18:00,437 --> 00:18:01,469
Now, hold on.

468
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:03,921
I've dated tons
of crazy girls in my life,

469
00:18:03,923 --> 00:18:08,426
and not once have I ever treated
them with anything other than...

470
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:09,811
Oh, right, I'm a monster.

471
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,064
Maybe the old lady
with the face tattoo is right.

472
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:15,933
Maybe the reason Jeanette's
acting this way

473
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,202
is Ted.

474
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:19,154
Me? How is this my fault?

475
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,456
Yeah, come on, this is Ted
we're talking about.

476
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,575
I'm sure he didn't do anything
to lead her on

477
00:18:23,577 --> 00:18:26,077
or send mixed signals,
right, Ted?

478
00:18:27,246 --> 00:18:29,247
Don't talk to me,
don't look at me.

479
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:32,250
I hate you and I never
want to see you again!

480
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:39,641
And we got thrown out
of the Barclays Center.

481
00:18:39,643 --> 00:18:41,259
Okay, that's disappointing.

482
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,927
So disappointing.

483
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,897
Seriously.

484
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:47,899
But that was last night.
I mean, it's not like...

485
00:18:49,101 --> 00:18:51,186
Listen, Jeanette, we really need

486
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,854
to have a serious talk
about our...

487
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:56,274
So, did Lily leave
these boots here

488
00:18:56,276 --> 00:18:58,410
or was it some other bitch?

489
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:04,649
Marshall, Barney, help me!

490
00:19:04,651 --> 00:19:07,118
I don't think they're coming.

491
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,937
I guess not.

492
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:15,159
It's those red boots.

493
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:17,128
They just look sexy
on everyone.

494
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,681
Okay, Ted,
what is with the red boots?

495
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:21,883
You're a smart guy,
you've got some taste,

496
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:23,385
you got a visual sense, I mean,

497
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:25,169
you're an architect
for Pete's sakes.

498
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,055
How can you look at
those boots and think...

499
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,507
Oh, my God, I'm holding it,
I'm holding the baby.

500
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:30,942
What, you've never
held him before?

501
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:32,677
Uh, tons of times.

502
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:35,613
This-this is not a
big moment for me.

503
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:37,115
(quietly):
This is exhilarating.

504
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,233
(crashing upstairs)

505
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:41,653
Look, yes, I know what
you're gonna say.

506
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,705
I have to break up with her.
No,

507
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,857
I was actually gonna
say the opposite.

508
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,293
I think you need to be
with Jeanette right now.

509
00:19:48,295 --> 00:19:50,194
Because she's the one.

510
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:51,379
No. What? No.

511
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:53,331
She's insane.

512
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,167
But I think you are also
a little insane right now.

513
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:58,536
So I think
you need to go

514
00:19:58,538 --> 00:20:01,556
be with your crazy girl for a
while and when it all goes down

515
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,758
in flames-- and I don't mean
that figuratively,

516
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,810
I expect there
to be actual flames...

517
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:07,679
NARRATOR:
<i>And there were.</i>

518
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,065
...we'll be here for you
because we love you.

519
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:16,721
Jeanette I just want
to say that, uh,

520
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:19,240
you going through
my stuff like that...

521
00:20:20,876 --> 00:20:23,695
You are really
something special.

522
00:20:25,164 --> 00:20:28,199
I'm gonna send Lily
a dead animal in the mail.

523
00:20:29,401 --> 00:20:31,419
I think I'm falling for you.

524
00:20:31,421 --> 00:20:34,289
I think we should have
a three-way with my therapist.

525
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,924
He's 70.

526
00:20:35,926 --> 00:20:38,676

00:20:58,321 --> 00:21:00,321
Okay.

534
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:01,406
Good night.

535
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:02,690
