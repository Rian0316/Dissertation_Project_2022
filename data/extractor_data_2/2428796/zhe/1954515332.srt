00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,610
-说说你们各自的近况吧  -对啊

18
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,860
<i>这可是个一言难尽的问题</i>
<i>This was a surprisingly loaded question.</i>

19
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,870
<i>自从马文出生以来</i>
<i>You see, right after Marvin was born,</i>

20
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,660
<i>莉莉和马修颁布了一项新规定</i>

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>而我们也在努力遵守</i>

泰德  你和维多利亚进展如何
Ted, how are things going with Victoria?

25
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,780
我爸说了个超好笑的笑话
My dad made the funniest joke.

26
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,490
他说我逃婚既然是因为你
He said that since you're the reason I left the wedding,

27
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,300
那他为婚礼支出的7万美元  你来还
you owe him the $70,000 he paid for it,

28
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,210
不然你就惨了
or else.

29
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,630
他平常可没这么有趣哟
You know, he's not usually funny like that.

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,920
前景不明朗  但算不上8分
Not promising, but not an eight.

31
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,840

这车才环保
Eco-friendly.

40
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,940
玉米动力车
She runs on corn.

41
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,260
简直让人性致全无  但算不上8分
Totally lady bone killer, but not an eight.

算不上8分
Not an eight.

45
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,190
她撑死了才6分  6.5分吧
At best, she was a six, six and a half.

46
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,030
滚完床单后  也就值4分吧
More like a four by the time I was done with her.

47
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,830

51
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,800
什么  你们才刚到啊
W-what? You just got here.

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
我特意为你们空出了一整晚
I cleared my whole night for you guys.

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,410
我甚至连约炮电话都没带
I didn't even bring my booty-call phone.

54
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,650
抱歉  但我们真的需要些私人时间
Oh, I'm sorry, but we just really need some time to ourselves.

55

-再见了各位  -拜

57
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,710
约炮约炮约炮  炮遍全世界 *
* Booty, booty, booty, booty rocking everywhere

58
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,180
约炮约炮约炮  炮遍全世界 *
* Booty, booty, booty, booty rocking everywhere

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,090
约炮约炮约炮 *
* Booty, booty, booty, booty

60
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,320
好像我真会把它留在家里似的
Yeah, like I'm going to leave this at home.

61
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,530
我是巴尼・斯丁森  请为我的"神雕"指路
Barney Stinson. How may I direct my penis?

62
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,210
能出来透透新鲜空气真好
It is so nice to be out in the fresh air.

63
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,800
你闻到了吗
You smell that?

64
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,910
这尿的味道终于不是马文的了
That's the smell of urine that isn't Marvin's.

65
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,300
天啊  我超想那个气味
Oh, God, I miss that smell.

66
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,900
我原以为我们会一刻不停地惦记着马文 
You know, I thought we'd spend the whole time worrying about Marvin,

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,510
但能出来透透气
but it's actually nice to be out

68
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,580
-享受下生活真不错  -是啊
- in the world, living life. - Yeah.

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,150
死神随时都会降临
Death is all around us.

70
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,860
那股子尿味刚突然变强了
Wow, that urine smell just got a lot stronger.

71
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,020
你们五个月以来  第一个自由的夜晚
So, you guys spent your first night out in five months,

72
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,130
就是坐在家里为你们的死亡做计划
sitting at home planning for your own deaths?

73
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,200
对  我们发现了一个帮人立遗嘱的网站
Yeah, we found this Web site that helps you make a will.

74
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,930
假如你不幸去世...  
In the event of your death... Ooh!

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,660
只是想到这个真的很伤心
It-it's just-just real sad to think about.

77
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,010
我知道
Oh, I know.

78
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,220
假如你不幸去世...
In the event of your death...

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,230
好了  不如这样
Okay, no, you know what?

80
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,020
我们从一些简单的条目做起
Let's just start with something easy.

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,100
请输入你的邮编
Please enter your zip code.

82
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,610
我们再也不会收到邮件了
We'll never get mail again.

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,600
我一直安慰莉莉  这一切都是假设
I keep reassuring Lily that this is all hypothetical.

84
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,800
相对而言  纽约是非常安全的
Relatively speaking, New York City is very safe.

85
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,480
拜托  电梯故障  井盖爆炸
Please, faulty elevators, exploding manhole covers,

86
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,830
因爱生恨的老公
jealous husbands.

87
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,330
这地方简直是验尸官的天堂
This place is a coroner's paradise.

88
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:02,430
抢劫升级成杀人的案件更是数不胜数
They are way more likely to eat it in a mugging gone wrong.

89
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,780
一周前你们的街区就发生了两起凶杀案
There was a double hommy on your block like a week ago.

90
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,790
午餐的时候  在扫描机上看见的
Caught it on the scanner during lunch.

91
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,770
拿刀子捅啊
Knife job.

92
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,160
当时的场面真是惨不忍睹啊
Guy made a real mess of it too.

93
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,420
话说回来
Anyway,

94
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,630
我们后来来到挑选监护人的环节
then we got to the section about picking a guardian.

95
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,460
有的夫妻会选一位自己的父母作为监护人
Sometimes couples choose one of their parents as a guardian.

96
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,180
这样简单多了
That makes it simple.

97
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,400
就我妈了
My mom.

98
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,780
你妈
Your mom?

99
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,100
我妈怎么了
What's wrong with my mom?

100
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,540
你是不是...
Are you...

101
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,990
45分钟后

102
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,270
好吧  行了
Fine. All right.

103
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,890
不把马文交给我亲爱的母亲
Marvin won't go to my loving mother.

104
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,280
但他总得有个去处吧
But he's got to go to somebody.

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,610
好吧
Fine.

106
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,390
我妈妈怎么样
What about my mom?

107
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,240
你妈
Your mom?

108
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,470
拜托
Um, excuse...

109
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,670
78分钟后

110
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,470
好吧
Fine.

111
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,500
不给我妈
Not my mom.

112
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,060
我爸爸呢
What about my dad?

113
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,410
你爸
Your dad?

114
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,070
1分钟后

115
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,070
好吧  他出局了
Okay, yeah, he's out.

116
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,610
等等  你知道谁最合适吗
Wait a minute. You know who could be good?

117
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,770
我哥哥马库斯
My brother Marcus.

118
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,610
他是个好爸爸
He's like a great dad.

119
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:04,820
你还记得他的圣诞卡片吗
Do you remember his Christmas card?

120
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:08,020
圣诞快乐
马库斯  莎拉
马丁  马库斯二世

121
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,500
除了牛仔裤  马库斯确实是个好爸爸
Questionable denim choices aside, Marcus is a good dad.

122
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,820
如果要寄养马文  家人是最好的选择
I guess if Marvin has to go to anyone, it should be family.

123
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,570
好的  很好
Okay, great.

124
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,050
好
Okay.

125
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,810
马库斯  近来好吗
Marcus, hey, how's it going?

126
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,330
老子好得很  臭小子
Pretty freaking sweet, buttwipe.

127
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,180
我把一切东西收拾好
I packed up all my crap, I said,

128
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,020
告别了莎拉和孩子们
"See ya" To Sarah and the kids,

129
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,280
终于在"寻欢作乐二号店"
and I finally got my dream job

130
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,770
得到了梦寐以求的调酒师工作
as a mixologist down here at Carnalism 2.

131
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,810
等等
Hold on.

132
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,880
有个白痴想用租来的潜水通气管吸大麻
Some punk's trying to use his snorkel rental as a bong.

133
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,740
拜托  你大麻放太多了吧
You be packin' that bowl too tight, mon.

134
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,840
所以我们现在还是没找到监护人
So, now we don't have a guardian.

135
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,100
作为你的挚友
You know, as your best friend,

136
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,960
如有需要让我来抚养马文  荣幸之至
if called upon, I'd be honored to raise Marvin.

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,570
如果你们想马文生活在  用旗杆晾内裤的环境中
If you want him to be raised by his underwear on a flagpole,

138
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,490
那就选泰德吧
Ted's your guy.

139
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,420
如果你们想让他成为欺负书呆的恶霸
If you want him pulling the chord on some other nerd's panties,

140
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,290
那选我准没错
I'm your guy.

141
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,400
我会教他如何成为了不起的人物
I'll teach that kid how to be awesome

142
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,290
这是你和莉莉永远教不会的
in ways you and Lily never could.

143
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,270
这将成为传...
It's going to be legend...

144
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,790
等等  算了  不等了
...wait for it, no, I won't wait for it

145
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,680
小马文也等不及了
and neither should little baby Marvin,

146
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,320
所以你俩最好现在就死了算了
so maybe it's better if you two just die right now...

147
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,040
...奇
...dary.

148
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,690
<i>莉莉和马修最漫长的一周开始了</i>
<i>And so began the longest week of Lily and Marshall's lives.</i>

149
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,380
改编自儿歌《Old McDonald Had a Farm》

150
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,380
麦当劳兄有农场  便宜了兄弟 *
* Bro McDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-bro

151
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,760
农场里面有小妞 *
* And on that farm he had some chicks

152
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,780
便宜了兄弟 *
* E-I-E-I-bro

153
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,820
一美妞在东  一傻妞在西 *  
* With a hot chick here and a dumb chick there...

154
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,660
改编自儿歌《Let your kite fly high》

155
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,660
兄弟  兄弟  划起你的兄弟船 *

156
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,920
轻轻划向酒吧 *

改编自儿歌《The Wheels on the Bus》

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,530
车上的咪咪  抖啊抖 *

160
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,700
上下抖  左右抖 *
* Up and down, up and down

161
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,950
车上的咪咪  抖啊抖 *
* The boobs on the bus go up and down

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,050
一路抖过城 *
* All through the town.

163
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,910
你以为用婴儿车就能贿赂他们吗
You think you can bribe them with a stroller?

164
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,810
傻子  他们已经有一个了
They already got one, fool.

165
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,940
这不是婴儿车  罗宾
Oh, this is no stroller, Robin.

166
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,560
我称之为"兄弟车"
I call it the Broller.

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,330
来  看看里面
Go ahead. Look inside.

168
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,650
看不懂  什么都没有
I don't get it. I don't see anything.

169
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,160
那是  不过爸爸懂
Yeah, but Papa does.

170
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,270
那是罗宾的咪咪吗
Those Robin's boobies?

171
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,730
当性感辣妹弯腰来看你的孩子时
When new nubile hotties lean in to inspect your bundle of joy,

172
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,990
你也可以看她的那对奶子
you can inspect their bundles of joy.

173
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,950
"兄弟车"
The Broller.

174
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,430
天啊  我真是个天才发明家
God, I come up with a lot of good stuff.

175
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,860
大伙儿  
Hey, guys, hey... Hey.

176
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,070
莉莉和我想请你们到楼上来
Lily and I need you to come upstairs.

177
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,450
这是个很重要的决定
This is an important decision

178
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,570
我们不能让你们幼稚的竞争
and we can't have you constantly interrupting us

179
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,760
不断打扰我们的生活
with this childish competition.

180
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,130
所以我们要来一场
Which is why we're going to make it

181
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,820
正式的比赛
an official competition!

182
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,820
"争夺教父母"大赛
We're going to play Who Wants to Be a Godparent?

183
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,210
广告之后  马上回来
Right after this word from our sponsors.

184
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,060
他为什么对着一面墙讲话
Why is he talking to the wall?

185
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,550
你们就用这个选出  谁是马文的监护人啊
Wait, this is how you're going to choose a guardian for Marvin?

186
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,970
那不如让我们参加三人搏斗铁笼赛
I mean, why don't you just put us in a three-way cage match

187
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,550
谁赢就归谁不得了
and go with whoever's left standing?

188
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,400
我们也想过  但是罗宾有压倒性的优势
We talked about that, but it gave Robin an unfair advantage.

189
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,720
伙计们  其实我们也很难做出抉择
Yeah, you see, guys, we were really struggling with this decision.

190
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,220
一路抖过城 *
* All through the town.

191
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,700
亲爱的  我知道他们最近
Babe, I know these guys have been

192
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,820
-有点夸张了  -才有点吗
- a little over the top lately. - A little?

193
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,190
不过为了以防万一  我们还是得选个监护人
But we still have to pick a guardian just in case.

194
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,970
万一什么
In case of what?

195
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,970
别逼我说出来
Don't make me say it.

196
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:57,710
说吧  我能接受  说吧
Say it. I can handle it. Say it.

197
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,900
万一我们死了
In case we die.

198
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,820
你还真说得出口
How can you even say it?

199
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,930
然后我就在想怎么去处理
And then I thought what do you do

200
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,070
我有个老婆一直在哭
if you got a wife who won't stop crying,

201
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,300
有三个傻蛋一直在贿赂自己
three idiots who won't stop bribing you,

202
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,060
还有一个人见人爱的制胜绝招
and a universally beloved skill for gamesmanship?

203
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,130
于是我想了一堆监护人该做的事
You take a bunch of guardianship scenarios,

204
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,000
写在转轮上  
throw them on a wheel,

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,330
给老婆买一条昂贵的裙子  不然她不参加
buy your wife an expensive dress, so she'll participate.

206
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,950
老娘又貌美如花了
I'm pretty again.

207
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,380
最重要的是  我只是想
Bottom line is I just wanted

208
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,360
让"万一我和莉莉死掉..."这个想法
to make the idea of me and Lily dying...

209
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,080
变得有趣
fun.

210
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,810
现在  请各就各位  我们要开始了
Now, if you'll step behind your podiums, we'll get started.

211
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,450
各位选手
Contestants,

212
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,640
比赛规则如下
here's how the game works.

213
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,310
莉莉会转动转轮  先别动
Lily will spin that wheel. Not yet.

214
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,170
指针指向育儿问题时
When it lands on a parenting issue,

215
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,700
你们将各自阐述会如何处理
you'll each describe how you would handle it with Marvin.

216
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,440
分数最高的选手将成为
The contestant with the highest score gets to be

217
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,750
马文的教父或教母
his godparent.

218
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,760
准备好了吗  很好  莉莉
Ready to play? Great. Lily,

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,900
转动转轮

220
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,240
听着  热情度也会影响你们的得分
Okay, now, see, um, enthusiasm will factor into your scores.

221
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,610
我再说一次
So, I say again:

222
00:09:58,610 --> 00:09:59,820
莉莉  转动
Lily, spin...

223
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,470
转动转轮
Spin that wheel!

224
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,260
我们的死亡

225
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,680
我们的死亡
Our demise.

226
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,450
巴尼  你要怎么向小马文解释  
Barney, how would you explain to little Marvin

227
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,190
-我们不在人世的原因  -太残忍了
- why we're not around anymore? - No.

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,070
很简单  我只要把我的泡妞金句
Easy, all I'd have to do is change a few words

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,700
改几个词就可以了
to one of my classics with the ladies.

230
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,640
世界总统安排你的父母
The President of the World has called your parents away

231
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,780
去执行一项机密的太空任务
on a super-secret space mission.

232
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,040
为了地球的安危  你再也见不到他们了
For the sake of the planet, you will never see them again.

233
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,620
收拾好你的玩具  和爸比说晚安吧
Now pick up your toys and say good night to Daddy.

234
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,860
真好  最后一句不改也适用
What do you know? That last line stays the same.

235
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,940
评委意见
Judges?

236
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,370
罗宾  你会怎么做呢  记住
Okay, Robin, what would you do, and remember,

237
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,090
"世界总统安排你的父母
"President of the World called parents away

238
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:49,090
去执行一项机密的太空任务"已经有人用过了哦
for a super-secret space mission" has already been taken.

239
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,180
我爸对我从不拐弯抹角  一向实话实说
Well, my dad was always upfront and honest with me,

240
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,030
所以我也会这样
so that's how I would be.

241
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,780
好了  孩子  你给我听好了
All right, kid, here's the deal with the deal.

242
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,250
你爸妈已经玩完了
Your mom and dad are done-ski.

243
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,960
扑通一声摔下地铁站台
Belly-flopped off a subway platform.

244
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,110
你妈被地铁碾开了花
Mom busted open like a pinata.

245
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,750
你爸残留的部分  在医院苟延残喘了几天
What was left of your dad hung around for a few days.

246
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,810
总之  生命仪器关了  器官也捐了
Anyway, plug's pulled. Organs donated.

247
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,770
长话短说  我就是你新妈妈了
Long story short: I'm your new mommy now.

248
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,490
节哀顺便吧
Sah-wish!

249
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,590
我本来是想留着当摆设的
Well, I was saving these for the showcase,

250
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,660
现在只好  莉莉宝贝  你看
but here. Hey, Lily, look, baby,

251
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,810
情侣表哦
his-and-her watches.

252
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,180
泰德  你有何高招呢
Ted, the category's all yours.

253
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,170
我的做法是
Okay, here's what I would say.

254
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,360
马文  要解释你父母的去向
Well, Marvin, explaining where your parents are

255
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,200
并不容易
isn't gonna be easy.

256
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,020
就算是我  莉莉和马修最好的朋友
Even I-- Lily and Marshall's best friend

257
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,840
有着近20年的深厚友情
for almost 20 years--

258
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,930
也无法轻松地完成这事
will have a hard time doing it.

259
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,820
但我知道有个人  特别擅长这种事
But I do know a guy who's very good at this sort of thing.

260
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,000
恐龙教授
Professor Infosaurus!

261
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
你好啊  小调皮
Hey, there, squirt!

262
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,860
死亡虽然不幸  但却无法避免
Death is a difficult yet unfortunate certainty.

263
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,450
很好
Good enough!

264
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,080
这一轮是泰德赢
Ted wins the round!

265
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,530
太好了  太好了  你们等着吧
Yes! Yes! You'll see.

266
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,920
恐龙教授肯定大受孩子们的欢迎
Professor Infosaurus will be a big, big hit with children.

267
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,550
是不是啊  孩子们
Isn't that right, kids?

268
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,050
<i>我们继续</i>
<i>Moving on.</i>

269
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,300
惩罚

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,850
惩罚

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,740
"当马文拿了其他小孩的玩具  你会怎么做"  
"How would you handle Marvin taking another kid's toy?"

272
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,930
巴尼  你来
Barney?

273
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,470
小菜一碟
That's easy.

274
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,440
我要向儿童机构举报你
I'm calling Child Services.

275
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,280
别着急嘛
Wait for it.

276
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,050
除非你把玩具还给小朋友  否则我要没收
I'll return your $1,900 alligator-skin belt

277
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,910
你那条价值1900元的鳄鱼皮皮带
when you return that toy.

278
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,580
在此期间  你就用这条丑陋无比
Until then, you can wear this

279
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,130
半黑半棕的双面用皮带吧
disgusting black-and-brown reversible belt.

280
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:55,210
哭屁啊  我和你一样不喜欢这条皮带
Hey, I don't like it any more than you do!

281
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,930
泰德  你会如何惩罚马文呢
Ted, how would you discipline little Marvin?

282
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,840
我绝对严格
I would be firm.

283
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,000
公平  但不失严格
Fair, but firm.

284
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,460
好了  以后不准看电视
You, sir, just lost your television privileges.

285
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,040
好吧  可以看电视  但是不准看暴力节目
Okay, you can watch TV, but nothing violent.

286
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,970
好吧  可以看暴力节目
Okay, it can be violent,

287
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,110
但不洗碗不准看
but you have to do the dishes first.

288
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,890
好吧  碗我来洗  电视你看
Okay, I'll do the dishes, you watch TV.

289
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,090
我们弄点冰激凌吃  好不好
Let's go get some ice cream! Come on!

290
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,560
但冰激凌不准撒糖屑
But no sprinkles.

291
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,020
-罗宾  你呢  -好吧  可以撒糖屑
- Robin? - Okay, sprinkles.

292
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,280
我将贯彻我爸的做法  严厉教育法
Um, I would do what my dad did: tough love.

293
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,040
小子  知道我要送你去哪吗
You know where you're headed, chief?

294
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,450
英属哥伦比亚省是加拿大的一个省

295
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,450
英属哥伦比亚男童军校
The British Columbia Military School for Boys.

296
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,360
当然  你本身是男孩
Of course, you're actually a boy,

297
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,150
所以你至少不用剃掉满头秀发
so at least you won't have to shave off all your hair

298
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,910
也不用把你的女生衣服  扔进油桶里烧掉
and burn your "Girlie" clothing in an old oil drum

299
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,330
烧的时候  你爸还站在旁边
while your father stands there

300
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,760
在火焰中冲你哈哈大笑
and laughs at you through the flames!

301
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,430
往事不堪回首啊
Oh, my God!

302
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,760
这一轮是罗宾赢
I think that Robin wins this round

303
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,460
因为我们都爱她
because we love her

304
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,020
而且她现在很安全  对吧
and she's in a safe space, right, guys?

305
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,690
-罗宾最重要  -绝对是
- Robin matters! - Yay! Totally.

306
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,690
同情分只能算一分哦
Now, that's just one point, right?

307
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,890
莉莉
Lily.

308
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,390
转轮  转起来
A spin... that... wheel!

巴尼  "你会如何向小马文
Barney, "How would you teach young Marvin

311
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,130
传授人性本能呢"
about the facts of life?"

312
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,920
你会爱死阿姆斯特丹的  老弟
You're gonna love Amsterdam, little bro.

313
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,920
荷兰阿姆斯特丹是性自由之都
以开放的性态度和性文化著称

314
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,110
这一轮巴尼出局
Okay, Barney's out of this round.

315
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,430
泰德  你会如何进行"两性之谈"呢
Ted, how would you handle "The talk"?

316
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,880
那时马文也算半个成年人了
Well, Marvin would be a young adult,

317
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,060
不能摆出居高临下说教的样子
so you wouldn't want to talk down to him.

318
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,220
但可以用别的方式让他理解
But that doesn't mean you can't get down with him.

319
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,750
一男一女想生娃 *
* When two adults wish to procreate

320
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,300
于是就把爱来做 *

321
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,010
男人精子一发射 *

322
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,290

323
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,960

324
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,690
打断一下  泡不到妞的人
I'm sorry, don't you need to actually have had sex

325
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,450
还能给人解释性事吗
in order to explain it?

326
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,080
恐龙教授还有首讲忽略恶霸的饶舌歌哦
Professor Infosaurus also has a rap about ignoring bullies.

327
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,950
罗宾  两性知识
Robin? Birds and bees?

328
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,860
我个人觉得
Well, I, for one, don't think

329
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,690
完全没必要教育马文两性知识
you have to teach Marvin a thing.

330
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,180
他如果有他爸的基因
If he's anything like his dad,

331
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,370
那就是天生的种马
he's a natural-born stud.

332
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,290
莉莉曾在黄瓜摊前
Lily got a little braggy

333
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,250
大大吹嘘过一番哟  "大家伙"
at a cucumber stand once, big guy.

334
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,260
罗宾再次获胜
Robin wins again!

335
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,460
-拜托  -赤裸裸的拍马屁
- Oh, come on! - That's clearly pandering!

336
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,230
转轮  转起来
A spin... that... wheel!

337
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,730
<i>我们玩到了深夜</i>
<i>We played long into the night,</i>

338
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,580
<i>终于进入了最可怕的</i>
<i>eventually making it to the dreaded...</i>

339
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,060
限时抢答环节
Lightning round!

340
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,720
人生第一词
First word!

341
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,460
横梁
Beam.

342
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,260
其实呢  那个叫托梁
Actually, that's a joist,

343
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,930
是用来承受天花板的压力
which carries the stress of the ceiling

344
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,190
和主体建筑重量的
versus the primary architectural load.

345
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,320
不过你真是我的乖孩子
But that's my boy!

346
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,620
书呆子
Nerd!

347
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,360
你真是我的乖孩子
That's my boy!

348
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,230
第一次为爱心碎
First heartbreak!

349
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,470
我知道你很伤心  小家伙
I know this hurts, little buddy,

350
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,320
不过以后你会有新的恋情
but you'll love again someday,

351
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,210
因为时间可以治疗心碎
because time will heal a broken heart.

352
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,330
但是治不好那小贱人的窗户
But not that bitch's window.

353
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:12,510
快逃
Run!

354
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,790
得了吧  我见过巴尼扔东西
Yeah, right. I've seen Barney throw.

355
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,730
他可不是威尼・派斯坦洛  我说得对吧
He's no Vinnie Pestano, am I right?

356
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,600
那个受人爱戴的印第安人棒球队中继投手啊
Beloved Indians' middle reliever.

357
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,930
克利夫兰的体育依然有重大意义
Cleveland sports are still relevant.

358
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,560
勒布朗是从哪来的  没错吧各位
LeBron who? Right, guys?

359
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,560
勒布朗・詹姆斯离开克利夫兰骑士加盟迈阿密热火队

360
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,990
泰德  你或是克利夫兰人
Ted, neither you nor Cleveland

361
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,280
都不懂如何忘掉抛弃你们的人
knows how to get over someone leaving them.

362
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,820
你处理心碎的办法估计就这样吧
Here's how you'd handle heartbreak.

363
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,890
振作点  小家伙
Cheer up, squirt.

364
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,140
外面的世界还有很多好女生
There are plenty of other wonderful women out there.

365
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:44,800
但我以为我的真命天女就是她了
But I thought that she was the one.

366
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,190
我要去巴尼叔叔家
I'll be at Uncle Barney's.

367
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,160
这太荒唐了
This is ridiculous.

368
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,050
我认识你们16年了
I've known you for 16 years.

369
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,310
我是不二的选择
I'm the obvious choice.

370
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,170
拜托  如果由泰德来养大他
Oh, come on, if Ted raises him,

371
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,950
那可怜的孩子到13岁时还会是处男
the poor kid's still gonna be a virgin when he's 13.

372
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,270
我才是不二的选择 
I'm the obvious choice.

373
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,640
作为我们之中唯一有阴道的人 
Hey, look, as the only one of us packing a vag,

374
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,390
我对照顾孩子之类的屁事有天生的本能
I got a natural instinct for nurturing and crap like that.

375
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,590
而且  我可以教他弓箭打猎
Plus, I can teach him how to bow hunt.

376
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:10,780
-我可以的  -我可是巴尼・斯丁森
- Yeah, I could do that. - I am Barney Stinson!

377
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,520
伙计们  伙计们
Guys, guys, guys!

378
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,320
好了  够了
Okay! All right!

379
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,890
很显然  你们都不懂
Obviously, none of you knows

380
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,010
为人父母的真正意义
what it really means to be a parent.

381
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,600
很显然  你们两个
Well... obviously, neither of you

382
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,050
再也不懂做朋友的意义
know what it means to be a friend anymore.

383
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,900
这话什么意思
What are you talking about?

384
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,190
想想吧
Think about it.

385
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,710
今天是这五个月来  我们跟你们俩见面时间最长的一次
This is the most we've seen you two in five months.

386
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,910
你们似乎对我们的生活毫不关心
You don't seem to care what's going on in our lives

387
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,340
只有8分或以上的事才能叫动你们
unless it's an eight or higher.

388
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,830
你们还想怎么样
Well, what do you expect?

389
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,710
-我们现在有孩子了  -是啊
- We have a baby now. - Yeah.

390
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,690
在麦凯伦混到打烊的日子已经结束了
The days of closing down MacLaren's are over.

391
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,100
除非你们想和我们一样
Unless you want to get up with us

392
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,420
每天早上在5点13分被宝宝的哭声吵醒
at 5:13 in the morning with a screaming baby.

393
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,580
就这样了吗
So that's it?

394
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,150
一个时代结束了  就这样吗
The... the end of an era, just like that?

395
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,680
听着  我们很抱歉我们没时间
Look... we're sorry if-if we don't have time

396
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,270
坐在酒吧里
to sit around the bar

397
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,070
倾听各种傻气的恋爱小问题
listening to silly little dating problems.

398
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,550
为人父母后
When you have a baby,

399
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,290
孩子不仅仅是人生中最重要的事
it's not just the most important thing in your life,

400
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,120
而是唯一重要的事情
it's the only important thing.

401
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,280
你们什么时候才能明白这点
When are you guys gonna get that?

402
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,540
我想我们明白了
Think we get it.

403
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,990
不敢相信他们就这样走了
I can't believe they just walked out.

404
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,470
是啊  或许这样才好
Yeah. Maybe it's for the best.

405
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,600
因为巴尼开始领先了
Barney was starting to pull ahead.

406
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,260
他们怎么能这样自私呢
I mean, how selfish can they be?

407
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,400
我们正努力抚养一个孩子呢
We're trying to raise a child here.

408
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,430
我很抱歉  我没有时间去管泰德的...
I'm sorry if I don't have time to deal with Ted's...

409
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,760
或是罗宾的...
um.... o-or Robin's...

410
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,410
或是巴尼的...
or-or Barney's...

411
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,480
我们将让他们其中之一做马文的教父母
You know, we were about to name one of them Marvin's godparent,

412
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,630
而我却不知道
and... I can't tell you

413
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,640
他们的生活到底过得怎么样
what's going on in any of their lives.

414
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,200
你觉得或许
Do you think that maybe

415
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,380
我们最近是没有尽到好朋友的责任吗
we've been a little crappy as friends lately?

416
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,690
你真的知道如何用弓箭打猎吗
Do you really know how to bow hunt?

417
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,850
对
Um, yeah.

418
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,290
在英属哥伦比亚男子军事学校里
At the British Columbia Military School for Boys

419
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,600
我们管这个叫"做午饭"
we called it "Making lunch."

420
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,270
各位
Hey, guys.

421
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,900
我们让米奇照顾马文
We asked Mickey to watch Marvin

422
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,030
这样我们可以下来聊一聊
so we could come down and talk.

423
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,140
我知道游戏没有结束  但是
I know that we didn't get to finish the game, but...

424
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,880
我们已经做出决定
we've reached a decision.

425
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,430
莉莉
Lily?

426
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,430
我们决定
We've decided...

427
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,470
撤销"8分或以上"规定
...to revoke the "Eight or higher" Rule.

428
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,900
什么
What?

429
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,900
我们想知道你们生活中的一切
We want to know everything that's going on with you guys.

430
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,700
真的吗
Really?

431
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,220
你们是我们最好的朋友
You're our best friends.

432
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,750
所有事都是8分或以上
Everything is an eight or higher.

433
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,560
<i>那晚是半年来第一次</i>
<i>And for the first time in almost half a year,</i>

434
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,470
<i>莉莉和马修在麦凯伦待到打烊</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall closed down MacLaren's.</i>

435
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,300
总之
Anyway,

436
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,360
维多利亚的父亲和我研究出了支付方法
Victoria's dad and I are working out a payment plan

437
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,090
利息率相当的合理
with a very reasonable interest rate.

438
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,100
至少  尼克的摩托是省油型的  
At least, Nick's cycle is fuel-efficient--

439
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,000
我们最快飙到了30  或35英里的时速呢
we're getting, like,30, 35 miles to the cob.

440
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,540
-是嘛  -没错
- Really? - Yeah.

441
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,800
我应该早点告诉你们那个6.5分的
You know, I should've told you about that six and a half sooner.

442
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,460
巴尼・斯丁森上了一个低于8分的
Barney Stinson banging anything less than an eight?

443
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,760
这事绝对值15分
That's like a 15.

444
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,980
<i>那晚很棒</i>
<i>And it was a great night.</i>

445
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,480
<i>直到</i>
<i>Until...</i>

446
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,700
早上5点13分

447
