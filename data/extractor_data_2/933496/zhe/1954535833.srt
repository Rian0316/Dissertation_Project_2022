1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,670
孩子们  我已经讲过了所有 重大节日的故事了
Kids, I told you stories about all the big holidays--

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,330
圣诞节
Christmas...

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,050
万圣节
Halloween...

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,230
感恩节
Thanksgiving...

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,960
但有一个节日永远是我的最爱
but one holiday was always my favorite--

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,730
超级碗杯 (美国橄榄球大联盟的决赛)
Super Bowl Sunday.

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,550
2007年的超级碗
And there was one Super Bowl back in 2007

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,210
我永远都忘不了
that I will never forget.

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,770
马修  你负责啤酒
Marshall, you're on beer detail.

10
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,670
莉莉  你来做土豆泥
Lily, you're making the bean dip.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,780
罗宾  你负责薯片和椒盐卷饼
Uh, Robin, you're on chips and pretzels,

12
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,460
巴尼  我不派你做事了
and Barney, I'm giving you nothing to do

13
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,300
你只要注意你的赌博问题就好
so you can just focus on controlling your gambling problem.

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,780
"问题"?
"Problem."

15
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,050
可怜的超人
Oh, poor Superman, he should really do something

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,120
他真的应该注意 一下他的飞行问题
about his flying problem.

17
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,950
如果你很在行 那就不算是个问题
It's not a problem if you're awesome at it.

18
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:43,030
而我要去奎恩那儿 带些超棒的食物
And I will be going to Quinn's to pick up the world's greatest food,

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,300
超级碗杯辣鸡翅拼盘
the Super Bowl Hot Wings Platter.

20
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,180
如果我是那只鸡 我愿意去食人族那儿看那些坏小子
If I were a chicken, I'd go cannibal for those bad boys.

21
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,030
吃了我那该死的翅膀吧 我不在乎...
Just eat my own damn wing off. I don't care.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,980
我超爱看的
I'm crazy like that.

23
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,670
这是明晚的活动安排
Here's the info for tomorrow night.

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,850
明晚什么事?
What's tomorrow night?

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,370
上帝  你们还不知道?
Oh, God, you didn't hear?

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,260
马克死了
Mark died.

27
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,200
- 天哪 - 上帝啊
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my gosh.

28
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,960
明晚6点举行葬礼
The funeral's tomorrow at 6:00, and I know

29
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,410
如果你们能来 马克的在天之灵也会感激的
it would have meant a lot to Mark if you came.

30
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,320
你们是他最喜欢的顾客了
You guys were his favorite customers.

31
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,850
- 坚强点 - 我们很遗憾
- Stay strong. - We're so sorry.

32
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,100
谁是马克?
Who was Mark?

33
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,450
- 不知道 - 不清楚
- No idea. - Not a clue.

34
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,420
那我们应该要去?
Well, I guess we should go, right?

35
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,710
等等...明天晚上6点 那是超级碗杯的时间
Wait... tomorrow night at 6:00, that's the Super Bowl.

36
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,590
我感到很遗憾 但我们真的不认识麦克
Okay, I feel terrible, but the truth is we didn't know Mike.

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,460
- 马克 - 马克
- Mark. - Mark,

38
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,510
所以只要我们送了花
and as long as we send flowers,

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,680
我想不出我们 一定要去的理由了
I can't think of any reason we'd have to go.

40
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,940
滚出去!
Get out of here!

41
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,750
我不想在这里再看到你了
I never want to see your face in this bar again!

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,440
那个没心没肺的混蛋刚刚告诉我说 因为他想看超级杯
This soulless bastard just told me he can't come to Mark's funeral

43
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,660
所以他不能去马克的葬礼了
because he wants to watch the Super Bowl.

44
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,560
你们能相信?
Could you believe that?

45
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,970
你们会来吧?
You guys are coming, right?

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,140
对...绝不会错过的
Yes... Wouldn't miss for the world.

51
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,010
只能这么着了...
Okay, here's the plan :

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,180
录下比赛 去葬礼...
record the game, go to the funeral,

53
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,940
- 向麦特致敬 - 马克!
- pay our respects to Matt... - Mark.

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,310
马克... 然后在1小时后继续看比赛
Mark, and start watching only an hour late.

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,530
要保证能录到
Okay, that's great, but just to make sure it records,

56
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,310
也许我们应该低头  向TiVo神 (TiVo:数位硬碟式录影机)
maybe we should bow our heads and say a quiet prayer

57
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,960
祈祷一下
to the TiVo gods.

58
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,290
万能的TiVo
Almighty TiVo,

59
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,390
我们感谢所有 你给予我们的礼物
we thank you for all the gifts you have given us:

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,710
能暂停直播电视 让我们方便一下的能力
the power to freeze live TV to go take a leak

61
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,590
这种能力伟大如神
is nothing short of Godlike.

62
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,870
当然还有在广告时间快进的力量
Let's not forget fast-forwarding through commercials.

63
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,830
向你再提出任何要求有点贪心了
It seems greedy to ask anything more from you,

64
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,740
神奇的盒子
O magic box,

65
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
但如果你出现故障 漏录了超级碗杯的话
but if you malfunction and miss the Super Bowl,

66
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,170
我们会用棒球棒 在巷子里蹂躏你
we will destroy you in the alley with baseball bats.

67
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,440
- 阿门 - 阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

68
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,770
广告时候 我们没有快进啊
We are not fast-forwarding through the commercials.

69
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,960
对  那是最好看的部分
Yeah, they're the best part.

70
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,850
算了吧  还记得去年吗?
Oh, come on. Remember last year?

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,310
是谁想看穿着椰子胸罩 猴子点披萨的?
Who wants to watch a monkey in a coconut bra order a pizza?

72
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,760
那只猴子真可爱
Oh, my God. This monkey was so cute.

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,830
这是我今天最后一次打给你了
Seriously, that's the last time I'm gonna call you today.

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,000
好的
Okay.

75
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,670
再见
G ood-bye.

76
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,920
你也没挂
You didn't hang up either!

77
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,780
我知道  你先挂
I know! You hang up!

78
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,380
你先挂
You hang up!

79
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,950
我的庄家  人挺好
My bookie. Great guy.

80
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,500
我直说了吧 你去葬礼难道不该穿西装?
So let me get this straight. A funeral is the one time you don't suit up?

81
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,450
我没教过你吗  泰德
Have I taught you nothing, Ted?

82
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,730
的确没有
Virtually.

83
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,810
西装在裁缝界是快乐的象征
Suits are full of joy.

84
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,190
这种快乐单纯如婴儿的笑脸
They're the sartorial equivalent of a baby's smile.

85
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,290
"裁缝界"?
"Sartorial"?

86
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,370
相关裁缝或那个行业的
"Of or pertaining to tailors or their trade."

87
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,250
西装是给活着的人的
Suits are for the living.

88
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,920
所以到我与世长辞的时候
That's why when it's my time to R.I.P.

89
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,130
我要像刚到这个世界时一样的
I'm going out of this world the same way I came into it--

90
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,550
赤裸裸
buck naked. Yeah.

91
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,980
那会很棒的
It's gonna be awesome.

92
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,120
男人们就在酒吧里寻欢 为女士们打开棺材让她们瞻仰
Open bar for the guys, open casket for the ladies.

93
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,830
怎么样?
What up?!

94
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,480
- 真可惜 - 是啊
- Such a waste. - I know.

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,040
他还这么年轻
He was so young.

96
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,460
手织羊绒双排扣的D&G西装
A hand-stitched, cashmere, double-breasted Dolce & Gabbana.

97
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,530
他肯定很害怕
It must be so frightened.

98
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,820
进度比我想像得快
This is going faster than I thought.

99
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,810
我们去酒吧 意思一下守灵
We'll make an appearance at the bar for the wake,

100
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,790
我们8点就能开始看比赛了
we'll be watching the game by 8:00.

101
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,400
即使那天我们没看到一条鲸鱼
And even though we didn't see any whales,

102
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,840
马克和我仍然认为那是我们 生命中最美好的一天
Mark and I both said it was the best day of our lives.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,010
我要再去转一圈了
Okay, I'm getting us another round.

104
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,840
等我回来
And when I come back,

105
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:52,830
每个人都说个 你最爱的关于马克的故事
everyone else is telling their favorite Mark story.

106
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,900
卡尔刚才讲的故事我要了
Dibs on the one Carl just told.

107
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,090
再过个超级碗杯的时间 我就要去上班了
Okay, I have to be at work exactly one Super Bowl from now.

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,080
面对现实吧 我们不可能去看了
Oh, let's face it, we're not going to get to watch it.

109
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,760
我们只要知道分数就行了
We  should just find out the score.

110
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,220
谢天谢地  我来问
Oh, thank God! I'll find out.

111
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,900
不...不...不行! 我们要一起看比赛
No, no, no, we can't! We have to watch the game together.

112
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,160
这是传统...
It's tradition.

113
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,110
想想我们一起看比赛的 那些快乐的时光
Think of all the great times we've had watching this game.

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,900
2次触地  大家喝啊
Second down, everyone drink.

115
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,480
这不是个喝酒比赛
Ted, it's not a drinking game

116
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,930
你喝酒的时候 什么事都会发生
if you drink anytime anything happens.

117
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,180
这些是鸡翅还是天使的翅膀
Are these chicken wings or angel wings?

118
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,120
我太爱吃了
God, I love these things.

119
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,270
我爱你们
I love you guys.

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,890
这真是太棒了 我们一起看超级碗
This is so great, all of us watching the Super Bowl together.

121
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,950
这很特别
This is special.

122
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,750
我们每年都要这么做 答应我
We need to do this every year-- promise me!

123
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,240
冷静点  兄弟
Calm down, buddy.

124
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,870
放广告了
Oh, commercials!

125
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,590
大家干杯!
Everyone drink!

126
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,390
这真是个好传统 我们大家一起看比赛
God, this is such a great tradition, all of us watching the game together.

127
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,140
这是怎么开始的?
How did this start?

128
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,020
巴尼  我赌20块 凯西进不了球
Hey, Barney, I bet you 20 bucks that Casey misses this field goal.

129
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,500
我不赌 只有傻子才打赌
I don't bet. Betting's for suckers.

130
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,190
赌个1美元啊什么的 这没什么大不了
Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.

131
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,900
好吧
Fine.

132
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,570
看吧  给你 他进球了  你赢了
See, there you go, he made it. You win.

133
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,560
等等  这是我的? 就这样?
Wait. This is mine, just like that?

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,870
天那  这感觉太好了
God, that feels good.

135
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,610
不  这感觉真是... 太好了
No, that feels really... good.

136
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,030
还有什么能赌的?
What else can we bet on?

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,120
没了  现在中场表演了
Nothing, it's the halftime show.

138
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,850
太糟了
Oh, so lame.

139
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,570
都没人注意吗?
Nobody even pays attention.

140
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,410
看呢  珍妮・杰克逊!谁在乎啊? (在中场表演中露乳)
I mean, Janet Jackson, who cares?

141
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,690
天啊  罗宾多棒啊!
God, how cool is Robin?

142
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,440
真不敢相信你在 我们这个神圣的日子里
I can't believe you invited this girl we've only known for a few months

143
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,050
邀请一个只认识了 几个月而已的女孩来
to  our sacred day.

144
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,750
现在所有的照片里都会有她了
Now she's gonna be in all the pictures.

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,360
是啊  是啊  无所谓 我赌  海鹰队
Yeah, yeah, whatever. I'll give you the Seahawks

146
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,180
赢6分  赌500美金
plus six points for 500 bucks.

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,250
你疯拉  50还差不多
Are you crazy? Maybe for $50.

148
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,160
50美金?50美金有什么意思?
$50?! What fun is $50?!

149
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,380
我们干脆赌空气算了 天啊  马修
Why don't we just bet air?! God, Marshall!

150
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,700
好吧  就50美金
Okay, $50.

151
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,980
算我一份
Hey, I'll take that action.

152
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,340
海鹰队  赢4分 但是赌1000块
Seahawks, but make it four points and make it a grand.

153
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,200
这些鸡翅   到底是鸡翅 还是天使的翅膀
Hey, these wings, are they chicken wings or angel wings?

154
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,480
广告!
Oh, commercials!

155
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,590
穿着椰子胸罩的猴子  太好笑了
Monkey with a coconut bra. Hilarious.

156
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,390
看吧  我们一直一起看超级杯的
Look, we always watch the Super Bowl together.

157
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,120
那么我们约好了 明天6点再看
So we make a pact to watch it tomorrow at 6:00

158
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,790
接下来的18个小时里 不准打听谁赢了比赛
and go the next 18 hours without finding out who won.

159
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,490
那怎么可能
That's impossible.

160
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,620
我不想骗你  那确实很难
I'm not gonna lie to you. It's not gonna be easy.

161
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,280
那意味着不准看电视  不准上网
That means no TV, no Internet,

162
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,040
不看报纸  什么都不做
no newspapers, nothing.

163
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,730
断绝一切媒体
Media blackout.

164
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,460
但我们的传统能继续
But our tradition lives on.

165
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,130
谁要参加?
Who's in?

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,250
- 我 - 我
- I'm in. - I'm in.

167
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,100
- 我 - 该死的  我也参加
- I'm in. - What the hell, I'm in.

168
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,190
- 击掌 - 兄弟 我们可是在守灵
- High five! - Dude, we're at a wake.

169
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,120
对不起  那严肃的击一下吧
Sorry. Solemn low five.

170
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,230
当第二天来临 我们中没有人知道
As the day began, none of us had any idea how hard it would be

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,690
要在9小时内不听到任何 关于超级碗的消息有多难
to go nine hours without hearing the outcome of the Super Bowl.

172
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,130
我决定在家工作
I decided to work from home to avoid contamination

173
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,250
以免被外面的世界污染到
by the outside world.

174
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,670
拿着这钥匙  吞下去
Hey, take this key and swallow it.

175
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,760
什么?不
What? No.

176
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,560
快点  泰德  然后沙拉 到比赛的时候就能拉出来了
Come on, Ted, you eat salads. It'll be out by game time.

177
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,340
那更不行了
Lots more, no.

178
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,990
我可不是在胡闹  西奥多
I'm not messing around, Theodore.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,530
我在这场比赛上赌了很多钱
I've got a lot of money riding on this game.

180
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,690
如果我不把我自己 烤在这个散热片上的话
If I don't handcuff myself to this radiator,

181
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,980
我就会去查比分了 快拿好钥匙
I'll check the score. Please take the key.

182
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,090
好吧
Fine.

183
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,920
但我同意是因为你没考虑 怎么上厕所的问题
But only because you didn't think through a bathroom plan

184
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,050
而且我觉得那样会很有趣的
and I think that's funny.

185
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,420
断绝媒体对罗宾来说特别难
The media blackout was particularly hard on Robin

186
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,990
因为   她就是媒体
because, well, she was the media.

187
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,280
但是不幸的是  市政府无法
But unfortunately, the City won't be fixing

188
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,770
马上修补这个大路坑
the unusually large pothole any time soon,

189
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,540
所以如果你在布鲁克林至皇后区 高速公路行驶  请系紧安全带
so buckle up if you're on the BQE.

190
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,490
那里会很颠簸的
It's gonna be a bumpy one.

191
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,050
看起来上班族还有更多的罪要受
Like morning commutes needed to get any harder.

192
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,700
没错  凯文
You're right, Kevin.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,230
好的  罗宾  你看是不是到时候 让西德来报道
Well, Robin, what do you say? I think it's time to check in with Sid

194
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,430
- 最新的体育消息了 - 不!
- for a sports update. - No!

195
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,020
- 什么? - 不
- What? - No.

196
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,870
现在是体育新闻时间了
But it's, uh, time for Sports.

197
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,750
不...不是... 现在是天气预报时间
No, it's not. It's time for Weather.

198
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,040
我们刚才报过了
We, we just did Weather.

199
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,400
气象非常多变
Well, weather's pretty fickle,

200
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,640
也许现在已经变了
it may have changed.

201
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,020
你那里现在怎么样了  罗?
What's it doing out there, Lou?

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,770
基本和2分钟前没什么差别
Pretty much the same thing it was two minutes ago.

203
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,930
回你那里了  罗宾
Back to you, Robin.

204
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,500
好的  现在是体育新闻时间
Okay, now it's time for Sports.

205
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,390
不!我们来看看交通情况
No! Let's go to Traffic Todd

206
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,440
来自地铁的新闻 一架用于堵塞时的直升机
in the Metro News 1 Gridlock Chopper.

207
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,460
罗宾  现在是体育新闻时间!
Robin, it's time for Sports!

208
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,070
到你了   西德
Over to you, Sid.

209
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,880
谢谢  凯文和罗宾
Thank you, Kevin and Robin.

210
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,530
让我们来看看超级碗杯吧
Let's talk about the Super Bowl.

211
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,980
几星期前 马修答应莉莉
Weeks earlier, Marshall had promised Lily

212
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:39,960
他会去她幼儿园班级的开放日
he'd come into her kindergarten class for show-and-tell day.

213
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,440
而且他有双重关节...
And he's a little bit double-jointed...

214
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,100
他最喜欢的动物是尼斯湖水怪
And his favorite animal is the Loch Ness monster.

215
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,840
莉莉  我说多少次了
Lily, how many times...?

216
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,610
尼斯是一种很友好的生物
Nessie is a gentle creature.

217
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,550
我们尽量不称它为"怪物"
We're trying to stay away from terms like "Monster."

218
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,580
我想我们都同意 他比莎莉的独眼金鱼
Well, I think we can all agree, he is much more interesting

219
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,870
有趣多了
than Sally's one-eyed goldfish.

220
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,470
连续3个礼拜? 别这样了  莎莉
Three weeks in a row? Come on, Sally.

221
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,750
好了  那么剩下的时间
Okay, well, that's all the time we have.

222
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,720
大家开始画画和做手工吧
Arts and crafts, everybody.

223
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,160
我是多齐
Hey. I'm Doug.

224
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,330
我是马修
Oh, hey, I'm Marshall.

225
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,800
你今天一天都要呆在这里?
Are you going to be staying here for the rest of day?

226
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,710
是的 其实我是躲在这儿
Yeah, I'm actually trying to hide out

227
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,040
因为我不想知道谁赢了超级杯
'cause I don't want to know who won the Super Bowl.

228
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,990
我知道谁赢了
I know who won.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,680
那很好 但我真的不想知道
Oh, um, that's great, but I really don't want to know,

230
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,960
所以可以的话 你自己知道就行了
so if you could just keep that to yourself.

231
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,890
你有多不想知道啊?
How badly do you not want to know?

232
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,970
什么意思?
Excuse me?

233
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,960
10块
Ten bucks.

234
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,550
你是认真的?
Are you serious?

235
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,810
现在升到8块了 (分不清数字大小的孩子)
Just went up to eight.

236
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,050
放开我  泰德
Unlock me, Ted.

237
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,370
我从来没有这么长 时间不打给庄家过
I've never gone this long without calling my bookie.

238
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,860
他会担心的
He worries.

239
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,480
看完比赛就放你
Not until game time.

240
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,660
你要去哪儿?
Where are you going?

241
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,020
去取我的鸡翅
Pick up the hot wings.

242
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,650
什么?你脑子进水了?
What? How the hell are you planning on getting

243
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,950
去体育酒吧怎么可能不知道比分?
in and out of a sports bar without seeing the score?

244
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,170
那里到处都是电视
There's TVs everywhere.

245
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,710
别担心
Ah, don't worry.

246
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,220
我都计划好了
I got it all planned out.

247
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,720
首先
First of all:

248
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,970
我在太阳镜上贴上胶带
I placed duct tape on a pair of sunglasses

249
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,390
我只能从两个小洞里往外看
so I can only see out of two tiny holes.

250
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,190
然后  我用旧麦片盒做了马眼罩
Next, I constructed blinders out of an old cereal box.

251
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,030
还有  高科技除噪耳机
Top it all off: high-tech noise-reducing headphones

252
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,050
马修和莉莉第一次回来时我买的
I bought when Marshall and Lily first got back together

253
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,590
它作用很大
and were doing it a lot.

254
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,400
我称它为感官剥夺器5000
I call it the Sensory Deprivator 5000.

255
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,830
你好  我叫泰德・莫斯比
Hello! Uh, my name is Ted Mosby.

256
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,650
我来这儿取我的辣鸡翅
I'm here to pick up my hot wings.

257
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,010
在我手里 你会找到鸡翅的钱
In my hand, you'll find the exact total for the wings

258
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,960
还有非常慷慨的小费
plus a generous tip.

259
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,570
请拿走钱
Please take the cash.

260
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:59,670
把鸡翅放我手里 然后我就回去了
Put the wings in my hand and I'll be on my way.

261
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,200
谢谢你
Thank you!

262
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,560
就这样本次超级碗杯终于结束了
And that closes the book on one heck of a Super Bowl.

263
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,590
还给你们了  凯文  罗宾
Back  to you, Kevin and Robin.

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,670
我们马上回来
We'll be right back.

265
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,500
而且是清醒得回来
And we're clear.

266
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,890
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

267
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,520
罗宾  是我弄错了
Um, Robin, is it just me,

268
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,000
还是你想与众不同?
or were you doing something different there?

269
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:28,950
我还没看比赛
I haven't watched the game yet.

270
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,480
我求你了 剩下的新闻里
I'm begging you, for the rest of the newscast

271
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:33,270
不要出现任何谁赢了超级杯的资料
there can't be any references to who won the Super Bowl.

272
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,980
我是说  把提词机里也改了
I mean, change the teleprompter.

273
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,080
不要有队伍的名字  没有特征
No team names, nothing specific.

274
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,600
这太疯狂了  我不能那么做
That is crazy. I can't do that.

275
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,590
我的朋友马克这个星期去世了
My friend Mark passed away this week.

276
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,110
好了  亲爱的  好了 好的  我很遗憾
Okay, sweety okay. Okay, I'm so sorry.

277
00:12:46,128 --> 00:12:48,050
Back in five... four...

278
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,020
这太难过了
- three... - It's just so hard.

279
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
8分23秒之后...

280
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,500
现在谁才是傻瓜！
Ha! Who's the idiot now?!

281
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,770
你说感官剥夺器5000很蠢吗
You said the Sensory Deprivator 5000 was stupid.

282
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,370
但它完全奏效了
But it totally worked!

283
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,110
我周围发生的事 我都看不见也听不见
I couldn't see or hear anything happening around me.

284
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,460
看吧  看吧
Right?! Right?!

285
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,390
不!
No...!

286
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,430
如果那还不够糟的话
And if that weren't bad enough,

287
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,950
我马上就要有个更痛苦的发现了
I was about to have a horrible realization.

288
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,850
豉油酱呢?
Where's the dipping sauce?

289
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,650
赢了的那队 你想知道和他名字押韵的词吗?
The team that won, want to know what their name rhymes with?

290
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,620
别这样  伙计 你说过我把蜡笔都吃了
Come on, dude. You promised you'd stop

291
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,590
你就不再为难我了
if I ate all those crayons.

292
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,610
你干嘛这么做?
Why are you doing this?

293
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,830
我爱上艾得仁小姐了
I'm in love with Miss Aldrin.

294
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:00,030
你不可能得到艾得仁小姐 她是我的...
Well, you can't have Miss Aldrin, she's mine.

295
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,760
好了  这是谁干的?
Okay, now who did this?

296
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,480
我干的
I did.

297
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,310
是不是马修要去罚站了?
Does that mean Marshall gets a time-out?

298
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,360
马修是大人  所以...
Well, Marshall's a grownup, so...

299
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,450
我们打破东西的时候 都要罚站的
When one of us breaks something, we get a time-out.

300
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,110
对不起了
S orry.

301
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,990
超级碗杯结束后
And after the Super Bowl,

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,860
输的那队的城市的市长要进贡
the mayor of the losing team's city had to pay up,

303
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,790
送15磅他或她城里最著名的食物
sending the mayor of the winning team's city

304
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,260
给赢了的那队所在的城市
15 pounds of a delicacy his or her city is famous for.

305
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,830
现在最好把烤肉架 蒸笼或油锅准备好
Better fire up whatever type of grill, steamer or fryer

306
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,390
你可能要用到它们来煮贡品
one might use to cook that delicacy, Winning Team's Mayor.

307
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:56,412
Hey.

308
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
我不想和你说话
- Hey. - I'm not talking to you.

309
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,870
不 你想...
Yes, you are.

310
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,770
你要按我说的做
You'll do whatever I say.

311
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,580
- 屏住呼吸 - 我不会屏住呼吸的
- Hold your breath. - I'm not holding my breath.

312
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,440
获胜的队伍是...
The winning team was the...

313
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,510
那么我们就这么解决吧
Now here's how this is going to work:

314
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,690
你每星期给我带3部成人级的电影
you're going to take me to three R-rated movies a week...

315
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
然后马修叔叔有了个主意
And then Uncle Marshall got an idea.

316
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,880
他回顾这主意不是那么得意
It was not one he was proud of in retrospect,

317
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,020
但在如此绝望的时候...
but desperate times...

318
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,290
不
Oh, no.

319
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,580
有人尿湿裤子了
Somebody wet their pants.

320
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,080
- 不  不是我干的 - 真的吗?
- No, I didn't. - Oh, really?

321
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,360
大家会相信谁呢?
Who's everyone gonna believe?

322
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,480
我是一个成年的哥伦比亚大学 法律系3年级的大人
I'm a grownup third-year law student at Columbia

323
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,000
而你只是小小尿裤子先生 现在我问你个问题
and you're just a little pants wetter. So now I ask you a question:

324
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,970
你想悄悄地 溜到洗手间弄干裤子
You want to be able to quietly sneak off to the restroom and dry off

325
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,730
还是让我把它 当成今天的活动主题?
or am I gonna have something for show and tell today?

326
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,390
- 所有人... - 好吧 好吧
- Hey, everyone... - Okay, okay.

327
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,140
你赢了
You win.

328
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,940
把钱还给我
I want my money back.

329
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,000
还有你的布丁点心
And your pudding snack pack.

330
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,560
先生  谁赢了超级碗杯?
Sir, who won the Super Bowl?

331
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,170
对不起  我没看比赛
Sorry. I missed the game.

332
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,820
你没看?  他怎么能没看?
You missed...?! How could he miss...?

333
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,610
不好意思!  谁赢了碗超级杯?!
Excuse me! Who won the Super Bowl?!

334
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,650
我...不太看体育
I... don't really follow sports.

335
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,200
天啊!
Oh, my...!

336
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,440
艾米特・史密斯 (美国橄榄球明星)
Emmitt Smith!

337
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,120
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

338
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,720
是的  很多人谢过我了
Yeah, I get that a lot.

339
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:19,250
你一定要告诉我 谁赢了超级碗杯?
You got to tell me, who won the Super Bowl?

340
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,480
昨晚的比赛？
The game was last night?

341
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,450
要是你赢了2或3次那种比赛
You know, once you win two or three of those things,

342
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,100
它就有点像是...
it's kind of like, eh.

343
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,040
但你是艾米特・史密斯  你是橄榄球员啊 那可是超级碗杯日啊
But you're Emmitt Smith. You're a football player, it's Super Bowl Sunday.

344
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,320
有什么会比橄榄球更重要?!
What could possibly be more important than football?!

345
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,540
跳舞  我的朋友  跳舞 (他参加了美国真人秀：与明星共舞)
Dance, my friend. Dance.

346
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,870
不!
N o...!

347
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,470
你好  又是我
Hello! It's me again.

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,420
我怎么会不认识你...
Oh! I didn't recognize you.

349
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:09,700
你忘了给我豉油酱了!
Yeah, you forgot to give me the dipping sauce!

350
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,660
噢  对
Ah. Yes.

351
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,030
就是这个
This is the one.

352
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,830
现在是4点  目前来看 我们都完成了不可能的任务
It was 4:00, and so far, all of us had done the impossible.

353
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,710
但是接下来  几乎是同时
But then, almost simultaneously,

354
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,450
事情开始变糟了
things started to go wrong.

355
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,610
让我们用快乐的音符来结束这一天
And let's end the day on a happy note.

356
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,570
布朗克斯动物园有最新消息
There is a new arrival at the Bronx Zoo.

357
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,270
泰里斯・桑切斯带来的报道
Trish Sanchez has the story.

358
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,860
- 伙计 - 伙计  当心
- Hey, buddy. - Hey, dude, look out.

359
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,430
由于昨晚在赢得超级碗杯之后
And in honor of yesterday's big win...

360
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,910
- 伙计  当心 - 伙计  小心啊!
- Hey, buddy, look out. - Dude, watch out!

361
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,380
公园决定命名公园决定
...the zoo decided to name the baby panda

362
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,510
用胜队为小熊猫命名为...
after Super Bowl champions...

363
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,940
不!
No...!

364
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,120
不!
No...!

365
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,540
不!
No...!

366
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,410
太好了!
Yes...!

367
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,640
太棒了  正是开赛的时候
Awesome. Just in time for kick-off.

368
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,430
你们都不知道比分  对吧?
None of you guys found out the score, right?

369
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,240
- 完成任务 - 不知道
- Mission accomplished. - Didn't find out.

370
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,660
太好了  我们开始吧 我已经快进好了
Great. Let's do it. I already fast-forwarded

371
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:44,200
闯过了比赛前4小时的新闻轰炸
through the four hours of pre-game coverage. So we are ready.

372
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,050
巴尼  我都不能看你了
Barney, I can't even look at you.

373
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,770
我不想看到任何关于 谁赢了比赛的信号
I don't want any sign of who won.

374
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,480
别担心  我不会给你 任何消息的
Don't worry, I'm not going to give anything away.

375
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,270
不要管我  开始吧
Feel free to start without me.

376
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,240
愚蠢!愚蠢!愚蠢!
Ah...! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

377
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,270
那么多钱!你搞砸了  巴尼!
So much money! You screwed it up, Barney!

378
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,580
你把一切都搞砸了! 愚蠢!愚蠢!愚蠢!
You screwed everything up! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

379
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,160
好了  我们看比赛吧
Okay, let's watch the game.

380
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,020
巴尼  你该死的在干什么了? 我们知道你赌谁赢了
Barney, what the hell was that? We know who you bet on.

381
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,370
现在你把所有人的比赛都毁了
Now you've ruined the game for everyone.

382
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,000
是的 谢谢了 巴尼
Yeah. Thanks a lot, Barney.

383
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,150
都被毁了
Way to blow it.

384
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,880
是啊  我不知道的 现在我知道了
Yeah, I didn't know and now I do know.

385
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,930
现在根本没必要看比赛了
There's no point in even watching the game.

386
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,050
至少广告没被毁了
Well, at least the commercials aren't ruined.

387
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,450
鸡翅还是不错的
Wings are still good.

388
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,240
啤酒还能喝啊
Beer still works.

389
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,440
该死的
Ah, what the hell.

390
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,540
我们来看看巴尼怎么输的钱
Let's watch Barney lose some money.

391
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,140
听着
Hey, so check this out:

392
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,770
我今天被一个5岁的人敲诈了
I got extorted by a five-year-old today.

393
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,050
我今天差点被炒了
I almost got fired today.

394
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,510
我今天遇到艾米特・史密斯了
I met Emmitt Smith today.

395
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,670
你先说
Ooh, you go first.

396
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,050
我实验了 我的感官剥夺器5000
I tried out the Sensory Deprivator 5000.

397
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,830
对  继续  巴尼
Yeah, go ahead, Barney.

398
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,370
我疯了似的冲下街
Well, I was frantically running down the street

399
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,230
想要知道比赛的结果
trying to find out the score to the game...

400
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,740
接下来就有趣了
And here's the funny part,

401
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,170
像那么难忘的一次超级杯
as unforgettable as that Super Bowl was,

402
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,150
23年之后  我不记得谁赢了
here it is 23 years later and I don't remember who won...

403
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,580
我甚至不记得谁参赛了
Hell, I don't even remember who played.

404
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,160
我记得的是  我们喝了啤酒
What I do remember is that we drank beer,

405
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,190
我们吃了鸡翅  然后 我们一起看了超级杯
we ate wings and we watched the Super Bowl together.

406
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,330
因为有时  即使你知道 有些事的结局
Because sometimes, even if you know how something's going to end,

407
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,920
那并不意味着 你不能享受它的过程
that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.

408
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,640
我们甚至还敬了老朋友马克一杯
We even raised a toast to good old Mike.

409
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,650
他叫马克?马特?
I mean Mark. Matt.

410
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,760
废话!  我为什么老是这样?
Crap! Why do I keep doing that?

411
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,860
我不只输了比赛 我输了所有的投注
I didn't only lose the game, I lost every single prop bet.

412
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,370
罚码总数  重战次数
Total penalty yardage, number of replay-challenges,

413
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,440
扔硬币的结果
coin toss...

414
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,880
输了扔硬币结果的比率是多少?
What are the odds of losing the coin toss?

415
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,750
5对5  输或赢都一样
50-50, give or take.

416
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,120
拦截  触地得分  抢球总数
Interceptions, field-goals, total sacks,

417
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,320
不管怎么样  总有样安全的 首先...
whether or not there'd be a safety, first...
