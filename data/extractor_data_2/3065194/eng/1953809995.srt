1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,703
My siblings and I

2
00:00:01,704 --> 00:00:04,348
are the first vampires
in all of history,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,866
The Originals.

4
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:09,570
Unlike them, I am a hybrid...
half vampire, half werewolf.

5
00:00:09,572 --> 00:00:12,823
300 years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

6
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,910
Now we've returned, drawn back
by a coven of witches

7
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:18,545
who threaten the woman
carrying my child.

8
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:20,998
That baby will bring
death to us all.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,499
Aah! Aah!

10
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,301
My brother
Elijah dealt with them.

11
00:00:24,303 --> 00:00:28,005
No one hurts
my family and lives.

12
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:29,673
We thought
Hayley would be safe.

13
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:31,225
I'm Marcel.

14
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:33,177
I don't think
we've met.

15
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,595
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

16
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:35,980
What?

17
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:38,148
Marcel was here.

18
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,684
We were wrong.

19
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,130
Ladies, gentlemen,

20
00:01:10,132 --> 00:01:12,383
welcome to fight night...

21
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:20,274
And the first rule
of fight night is,

22
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:23,027
the vampire left standing
at the end of the night

23
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:25,729
is one step closer
to the inner circle

24
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:29,817
and one of these...
a daylight ring.

25
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,454
If you can impress me
with a little ultra-violence,

26
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:37,574
you too can enjoy the warmth
of the sun on your face.

27
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:41,245
All you got to do
is kick a little ass.

28
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:45,282
So here we go.

29
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:50,787
Our first two contenders...

30
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,174
Felicia and Otto.

31
00:01:56,061 --> 00:01:57,728
Ha ha ha!

32
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:31,211
Whoo!
Damn, girl, not bad.

33
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:41,271
Good evening.
I'd like a word.

34
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:42,806
What do you think
you're doing?

35
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:45,359
It appears
that we've interrupted

36
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:49,179
a collection
of filthy amateurs.

37
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,533
We've come here
for the girl.

38
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:56,487
Give her to us,
or...We kill everyone here.

39
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,658
You two got
a lot of nerve

40
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,461
coming into my home
and making demands.

41
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:05,964
You're home,
is it?

42
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:09,299
The girl.
I will not ask again.

43
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,468
I assume you're
talking about Hayley...

44
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,172
yay high, dark hair,
bitchy attitude.

45
00:03:15,174 --> 00:03:16,974
Who is she, anyway?

46
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:18,592
She's an old friend.

47
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:22,012
You know how sentimental
I am about old friends.

48
00:03:22,014 --> 00:03:23,931
Well, I ain't
got her,

49
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,016
and before you
start whining,

50
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:28,152
I did pay her a little
visit last night.

51
00:03:28,154 --> 00:03:29,820
I was feeling
nostalgic.

52
00:03:29,822 --> 00:03:32,122
So I took a trip out
to the plantation

53
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,658
where I used to be
a slave,

54
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,529
and imagine my surprise
when I realized

55
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,081
that the Original
family of vampires

56
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:43,450
had taken up
residence.

57
00:03:43,452 --> 00:03:45,986
Your girl Hayley
answered the door.

58
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:48,839
We exchanged hellos.
That was it.

59
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,791
You don't believe me,
look around.

60
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,376
Hell, I'll even
help you find her,

61
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:54,845
but the question
I'd ask is,

62
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,048
if Hayley
isn't here,

63
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,801
then where is she?

64
00:04:15,817 --> 00:04:17,267
Uh!

65
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:34,084
Uh! Uh!

66
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,919
Seriously?

67
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,388
You don't want
to fight me, Hayley.

68
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,424
You know you can't
beat a hybrid.

69
00:04:40,426 --> 00:04:43,093
Aah! Let me go,

70
00:04:43,095 --> 00:04:45,679
you backstabbing,
half-breed piece of sh...

71
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,514
shut up!

72
00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:56,217
Sync & corrections by <font color="#00ff00">Rafael UPD</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.Addic7ed.Com/</font>

73
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,807
Not the most
attractive community,

74
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,076
are they?

75
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,694
You do realize
they can hear you.

76
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:04,114
You do realize
I don't care.

77
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:08,619
You know, Elijah,
I liked you better in that box,

78
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,455
but, Klaus, my sire,
you I owe the world,

79
00:05:11,457 --> 00:05:14,758
and I always show
respect to my elders.

80
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,177
If your special
lady friend is missing,

81
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:19,379
you can benefit
from the help of a witch,

82
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:22,382
and since I control
all the witches in this town,

83
00:05:22,384 --> 00:05:25,185
I'll Grant you one
little locator spell.

84
00:05:25,187 --> 00:05:27,337
Sabine is the best guide
in the quarter.

85
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:29,273
You need to find someone,

86
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:32,359
I guarantee
she's your girl.

87
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:34,561
Where are you
going?

88
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:37,531
I hate to cut this short,
but the sun is coming up soon.

89
00:05:37,533 --> 00:05:39,149
My nightwalkers
need to get inside,

90
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:40,901
and I've got
a city to run.

91
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:44,020
I'll leave you to track down
your lost sheep.

92
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,278
Can you find her?

93
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,914
I can try.

94
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:06,176
What is this place?

95
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:09,930
The armpit
of Louisiana.

96
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:11,982
What are you gonna
do with that?

97
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,600
Depends on you.

98
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:16,353
Hey, you attacked
me, remember?

99
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:19,022
You ambushed me
in my own back yard.

100
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:21,441
It's not your back yard.
It's Klaus'.

101
00:06:21,443 --> 00:06:23,910
You're shacked up in
a mansion with that psycho,

102
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:25,779
a long way from the girl
I met in the appalachians

103
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,281
helping
other werewolves.

104
00:06:27,283 --> 00:06:29,616
Tyler, I'm sorry,
but a lot has happened

105
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,335
since the last time
I saw you.

106
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,121
You mean like
how you're pregnant?

107
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:39,092
A hybrid baby. Yeah.
I know all about it.

108
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,794
I've been roaming
around the bayou

109
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,629
asking questions.

110
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:44,598
Let me tell you
what I learned.

111
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,266
This crescent birthmark
means you come

112
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,885
from a big shot family,
some kind of royalty

113
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:50,554
to the werewolves
of this region,

114
00:06:50,556 --> 00:06:52,973
and right here,

115
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:56,526
this is all
that's left of them.

116
00:07:02,984 --> 00:07:05,319
Hey, help me.

117
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:08,238
They can't help you.

118
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,990
They're in
the woods hiding

119
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:11,208
because they've
been persecuted

120
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,877
for decades
by vampires.

121
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,581
Is that her?

122
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,451
Yeah, Dwayne.
Get her inside.

123
00:07:21,453 --> 00:07:23,887
Tyler? Tyler?

124
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:35,399
She's in
the back country,

125
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,251
way out past houma,
deep in the bayou.

126
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:40,637
I don't suppose
you could be more precise.

127
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,655
What's the matter, Elijah,

128
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:43,190
are you worried a bit suppose
of splashing about in the bog

129
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,325
might ruin
your expensive shoes?

130
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:47,361
As a matter of fact,
after my recent confinement,

131
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:49,579
I could use a decent stroll
through the countryside.

132
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,449
There are stories of
exiled werewolves,

133
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,168
encampments.

134
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,370
If Hayley went out
that far,

135
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:58,288
chances are, she
went to find them.

136
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,706
Clearly, she hopes to make
the acquaintance

137
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,291
of more like herself.

138
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,661
I suppose our company
wasn't good enough for her.

139
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:25,232
You could always
join them, you know.

140
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:28,819
Uh, drinking games.

141
00:08:28,821 --> 00:08:30,704
It's not really
my thing.

142
00:08:30,706 --> 00:08:33,240
It kind of reminds me of
the jocks in my High School.

143
00:08:33,242 --> 00:08:35,692
We had a pretty high quota
of what you'd call

144
00:08:35,694 --> 00:08:37,627
douche nozzles.

145
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:40,580
Bullies, huh?
Yeah.

146
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,999
Wonder what'd happen if
you saw those guys now.

147
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,034
I bet you'd tear
them apart, right?

148
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,838
Ah, yeah, totally.

149
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,341
Ha! Probably go
all vamp ninja on them.

150
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:54,644
Ha ha ha! You're
a funny guy, Josh.

151
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:56,813
In fact, I thought
it was really

152
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:59,349
funny last night,
you know,

153
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:01,050
seeing you
at that plantation

154
00:09:01,052 --> 00:09:04,855
where Klaus
is staying.

155
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:08,241
Ho ho! Ha ha ha!

156
00:09:08,243 --> 00:09:11,394
You going
somewhere, Josh?

157
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:17,033
We should head south
towards the water.

158
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,536
You seem quite determined
to find the little wolf.

159
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:20,921
If I'm moving too fast
for you, Niklaus,

160
00:09:20,923 --> 00:09:22,923
you're welcome
to wait in the car.

161
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:25,208
Do be certain to leave
the windows down.

162
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,427
Ah, so I've
touched a nerve.

163
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:29,679
You've begun
to admire this girl.

164
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,598
Perhaps that's why
you've been barking orders

165
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,967
since your return,
hoping to impress Hayley

166
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,102
by assuming the role
of family patriarch.

167
00:09:36,104 --> 00:09:37,187
You want to insist
on treating her

168
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:38,271
like a walking
incubator,

169
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:41,691
then that's
your mistake.

170
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:45,312
Have you
found her scent?

171
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:48,448
No...

172
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,151
But I found
someone else's.

173
00:09:51,153 --> 00:09:53,653
This vehicle reeks

174
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:57,941
of someone I thought
I was rid of...

175
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:00,911
Tyler Lockwood.

176
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,996
And why would your
little hybrid sidekick

177
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:05,131
from Mystic Falls have
any interest in Hayley?

178
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:09,202
He wants revenge because
I went after his girl.

179
00:10:09,204 --> 00:10:10,587
Why do I suspect
this is the least

180
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,838
of your offenses?

181
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,123
Back when I had the means
to sire hybrids,

182
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:16,676
he was my first,

183
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:22,148
although I didn't give him
much choice in the matter.

184
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,935
He was loyal
in the beginning,

185
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:26,653
but he grew
insubordinate,

186
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,271
turned my other hybrids
against me.

187
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,440
I couldn't have that.

188
00:10:30,442 --> 00:10:34,077
So I massacred
the lot of them.

189
00:10:35,613 --> 00:10:38,081
Tyler ran
like a coward

190
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,783
before I could
finish him off.

191
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:43,253
Anything else that
you would like to share?

192
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:46,322
Well, there was
this business with his mum.

193
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,261
You killed his mother.
Wonderful.

194
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,046
He needed to be
taught a lesson.

195
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:54,431
And what lesson will
you be taught, Niklaus,

196
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,466
if he retaliates
by harming Hayley?

197
00:10:56,468 --> 00:11:00,437
So you do care about her.
Well, go on, then.

198
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,022
Have at it, brother.
Save her.

199
00:11:02,024 --> 00:11:03,390
Claim what spoils
you can.

200
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:04,641
I've sampled what
she has to offer,

201
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,776
and, let me tell you,
she is exquisite.

202
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:08,194
Niklaus,
so help me...

203
00:11:08,196 --> 00:11:10,814
enough.

204
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:14,183
I'll kill
Tyler Lockwood myself.

205
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,935
Marcel,
something is happening.

206
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,437
There's a witch doing
magic in the quarter.

207
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,572
Oh, no worries.
That one is Marcel-approved.

208
00:11:30,574 --> 00:11:32,608
Besides...
Oh!

209
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,577
Got something else
for you to handle.

210
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,454
Oh, no. You're
the super witch.

211
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,489
Say hi to Josh.

212
00:11:47,491 --> 00:11:49,425
Why would you
bring him here?

213
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:51,043
Josh has a problem.

214
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,128
Klaus compelled him
to spy on me.

215
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,663
Agh!

216
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,098
I can't have that.

217
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,434
So I thought,
"I'll just kill Josh."

218
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,602
Marcel, please.
It's not my fault.

219
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,104
Then I thought,
"killing a vampire,

220
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:03,839
that would be breaking
my own rule."

221
00:12:03,841 --> 00:12:05,774
Smart thing to do
is to flip Josh.

222
00:12:05,776 --> 00:12:08,277
That way, he can tell Klaus
whatever I want.

223
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,895
He could even
spy for me.

224
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:12,114
All we got to do
is wipe away that compulsion.

225
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:14,483
So what do you think?

226
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,652
I can make him forget
what Klaus told him,

227
00:12:16,654 --> 00:12:18,787
but the more
Klaus said,

228
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:20,489
the more it's
gonna hurt.

229
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,542
Hmm, probably gonna
hurt a lot.

230
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:25,711
Josh?

231
00:12:25,713 --> 00:12:27,713
I'll do it,

232
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:30,499
anything, yes.

233
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:32,968
How much pain
are we talking?

234
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,520
R...
anything, yes.

235
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,439
Klaus destroyed everything
good in my life.

236
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:46,742
So I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

237
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,977
No, please,
Tyler, please.

238
00:13:48,979 --> 00:13:51,613
Aah!

239
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:06,178
Ggh...

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,130
Uh...

241
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:09,998
Oh!

242
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:32,187
I thought you were leaving town.
Couldn't stay away, huh?

243
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:34,156
I was half past Louisiana
when I found out

244
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:35,357
you invaded our home.

245
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,159
What have you done
with Hayley?

246
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,380
You're so hot
when you're angry.

247
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,831
Uh!

248
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:47,766
You used me.

249
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:49,517
I'm pretty sure
that was mutual.

250
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,020
Beguiled by your charms,
I slept with you like a fool,

251
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:54,555
led you to our home,
and then you took Hayley.

252
00:14:54,557 --> 00:14:56,941
Whoa, I didn't
take anybody.

253
00:14:56,943 --> 00:14:59,360
I already sorted this
out with your brothers,

254
00:14:59,362 --> 00:15:01,746
but it begs
the question,

255
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:04,032
why'd you come back?

256
00:15:04,034 --> 00:15:05,366
If Klaus learns
it's my fault

257
00:15:05,368 --> 00:15:06,835
you found your way
to the plantation...

258
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:08,703
you really think
I'd rat you out?

259
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:10,038
Come on.

260
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,756
If you think that
I'd ever in 1,000 years

261
00:15:11,758 --> 00:15:14,008
do anything to hurt you,

262
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,045
you got me confused
with Klaus.

263
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:21,749
All your charms
and flirtations

264
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,202
simply prove you're
every bit the liar

265
00:15:24,204 --> 00:15:26,638
and manipulator
that Klaus is.

266
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,056
Is that what
you really think?

267
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:31,059
By all means,
prove me wrong.

268
00:15:31,061 --> 00:15:34,979
Fine. Come on.

269
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:38,950
Something
you need to see.

270
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,360
Don't get all judgey.

271
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:52,113
Dwayne knew what
he was getting into.

272
00:15:52,115 --> 00:15:53,581
He volunteered.

273
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,216
For you to kill him?

274
00:15:55,218 --> 00:15:57,836
Dwayne is a werewolf who died
with your blood in his system,

275
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:01,172
same blood you share
with your hybrid baby.

276
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:04,292
You're trying
to turn him.

277
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,060
That's impossible.

278
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:08,346
Been running with wolf packs
all over the country.

279
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,631
One of them was tight
with a witch.

280
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:12,534
She had nightmare visions
about your baby

281
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,768
and how Klaus could
use its blood

282
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,136
to make an army
of hybrid slaves.

283
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:17,105
I am sick
of these witches

284
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:19,107
and the premonitions
about my baby.

285
00:16:19,109 --> 00:16:20,641
It's just a baby.

286
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:23,695
Maybe. Maybe not.

287
00:16:23,697 --> 00:16:25,313
That's where
Dwayne comes in.

288
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,315
You see, he was happy
to be the test case.

289
00:16:27,317 --> 00:16:28,482
If you haven't noticed,
these people

290
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:29,868
don't have much
to live for.

291
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:31,152
They'd all welcome
the chance to become

292
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,787
the superior species.

293
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:36,875
Trouble is, all hybrids
are sired to Klaus.

294
00:16:36,877 --> 00:16:40,044
They follow
his every move.

295
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:43,131
No way I'd
let that happen.

296
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,001
How can you be
so sure Klaus knows

297
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,770
what the baby's
blood will do?

298
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,188
What do you think?

299
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,556
Klaus Mikaelson...

300
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:52,891
killer of men,
women, and puppies...

301
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:54,392
all of a sudden
wants to be a daddy,

302
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:58,479
or he's got
an ulterior motive.

303
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:00,315
Hybrids can walk
in the sun.

304
00:17:00,317 --> 00:17:02,450
Their bite is lethal
to vampires.

305
00:17:02,452 --> 00:17:04,235
They'll take over New Orleans
by the end of the week,

306
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:07,455
and you know what's
gonna stop Klaus then?

307
00:17:07,457 --> 00:17:09,541
Nothing.

308
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:18,666
You're gonna have
to feed on her.

309
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:21,202
What? No.

310
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,204
Aah...

311
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:25,706
do it.

312
00:17:27,227 --> 00:17:29,811
No. No! Aah!

313
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:32,063
Aah!

314
00:17:33,683 --> 00:17:35,233
Dwayne...
easy.

315
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:50,248
You're ok.
Look at me.

316
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,417
You're ok.

317
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:57,105
Look at me.
Look at me.

318
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,746
You're ok.

319
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:13,421
I'm better than ok.

320
00:18:19,982 --> 00:18:24,101
Aagh!

321
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,954
Aagh!

322
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:28,289
I'm sorry, but it's
just gonna get worse.

323
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,442
Klaus' compulsion
runs deep.

324
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,494
You need to think
of something else,

325
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:37,749
take your mind
off it.

326
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:40,501
Do you like music?

327
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:42,553
What? What?

328
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:45,840
I can't think
about music right now.

329
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,308
Why? I don't know.

330
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,894
Maybe because you're
giving me a voodoo lobotomy.

331
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,015
Do you like jazz?

332
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:55,400
Oh...

333
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:58,369
So what, then?

334
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,022
Club stuff...

335
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:04,609
house, trance,
you know...

336
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,127
♪ nn ss
nn ss nn ss ♪

337
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,029
I'm a witch.
I'm not amish.

338
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:11,199
It's just I'm only 16.
I don't go to clubs.

339
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,203
When I was 16,
I'd been to 100 clubs.

340
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:22,927
God, it was only
4 years ago.

341
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:29,050
Feels like
another life.

342
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:34,605
All I wanted to do
was meet boys.

343
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:38,843
Things are so much
more complicated.

344
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,512
I mean, now all I want
to do is meet boys

345
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,849
and feed
on people's blood,

346
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,235
get one of those
daylight rings

347
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:51,122
so I don't burn
in the sunlight,

348
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,741
all perfectly
normal things.

349
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,998
I like the classics...

350
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,886
puccini, bach, Mozart.

351
00:20:04,888 --> 00:20:06,921
I took piano,

352
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:10,575
not that it matters
while I'm stuck here.

353
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,727
Why not?

354
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:19,734
Marcel is worried
that someone could hear.

355
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:20,985
It's not his fault.

356
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,405
He just wants
to keep me safe.

357
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:26,741
Safe from what?

358
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:29,894
Basically, a coven
of psycho witches

359
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,296
want to sacrifice me
in a blood ritual.

360
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:36,367
Oh, wow. Ok.

361
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,454
Uh, I'm...Sorry.

362
00:20:39,456 --> 00:20:43,741
Don't be. I'm gonna
destroy them all,

363
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,259
and once
the gone,

364
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,179
everything will
go back to normal.

365
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:51,599
I'll have
my old life back.

366
00:20:58,868 --> 00:21:02,871
It worked, didn't it?
He's a hybrid.

367
00:21:02,873 --> 00:21:04,373
If Klaus gets
a hold of you,

368
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,643
if he gets that kid,
he wins.

369
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:12,398
Then help me hide
the baby from him.

370
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,516
Help me run.

371
00:21:14,518 --> 00:21:16,435
He'll find you.

372
00:21:16,437 --> 00:21:17,770
He'll take
your kid away,

373
00:21:17,772 --> 00:21:19,939
and he'll make
more hybrid monsters,

374
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:21,774
slaves who do
everything he says.

375
00:21:21,776 --> 00:21:24,493
Tyler, whatever you're
thinking of doing,

376
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:25,945
there has to be
another way.

377
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:28,831
You're not
like this.

378
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,284
Uh!
Agh! D'ugh!

379
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:36,505
Agh! That was stupid.

380
00:21:36,507 --> 00:21:38,457
Get away
from her.

381
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:39,842
What do you care?

382
00:21:39,844 --> 00:21:41,010
I said, get away.

383
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:42,294
You got what you wanted.
Not get lost.

384
00:21:42,296 --> 00:21:44,913
Dwayne, he's
gonna kill me.

385
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,382
He's gonna
kill you, too.

386
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:47,582
He said that hybrids

387
00:21:47,584 --> 00:21:49,101
are too dangerous
to live.

388
00:21:49,103 --> 00:21:50,102
You need
to stop him.

389
00:21:50,104 --> 00:21:52,688
Shut up.
Uh!

390
00:21:54,474 --> 00:21:57,693
Uh!
Agh!

391
00:21:57,695 --> 00:22:00,229
Uh!

392
00:22:24,421 --> 00:22:26,171
Huh!

393
00:22:26,173 --> 00:22:27,890
Forgive me.

394
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,059
Thought you
were in danger.

395
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:33,646
It appears
I was mistaken.

396
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:43,238
You will not believe
the crap day that I'm having.

397
00:22:45,475 --> 00:22:47,993
Let me
take you home.

398
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:49,445
Elijah...

399
00:22:50,813 --> 00:22:56,752
There's something you need
to know about the baby.

400
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,170
Hayley,

401
00:22:58,172 --> 00:23:00,873
don't make this harder
than it has to be.

402
00:23:02,709 --> 00:23:05,127
Give up now...

403
00:23:06,296 --> 00:23:08,681
I'll end it quick.

404
00:23:08,683 --> 00:23:10,499
Quite an offer,

405
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:13,602
though not one I'll
be extending to you.

406
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,554
Klaus.

407
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:19,525
Hello, Tyler.
You look well.

408
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:23,078
I aim
to change that.

409
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,642
Threatening
a pregnant girl

410
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,844
in order to exact
revenge against me.

411
00:23:32,846 --> 00:23:35,647
I never expected you
to sink so low.

412
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:39,651
I admit,
I'm impressed.

413
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:41,853
I used to hang out
with you.

414
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,572
I guess something
must have rubbed off.

415
00:23:43,574 --> 00:23:45,490
What do you think
Caroline would say

416
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,659
if she saw what
you've become?

417
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:50,028
Perhaps I'll ask her
when I call her

418
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,164
to tell her
of your demise.

419
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,999
Whatever happens to me,

420
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:57,169
Caroline is never
gonna stop hating you.

421
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,541
Come on, mate.
Give it a bit more effort.

422
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,543
I want to enjoy myself.

423
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:24,556
What is this place?

424
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:26,124
This is the garden.

425
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,810
It's where I punish
vampires who break my rules,

426
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:33,815
but a long time ago,
used to be something else.

427
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,356
Go on.
Tell me what you see.

428
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:46,528
Two stories,
Greek columns,

429
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:49,164
wraparound porch,
high ceilings,

430
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:51,249
transom windows.

431
00:24:51,251 --> 00:24:54,536
It's lovely.
So what?

432
00:24:54,538 --> 00:24:59,374
So I designed it for you.
It was gonna be ours.

433
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:07,665
That...

434
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:11,136
this was supposed to be
our happily ever after?

435
00:25:11,138 --> 00:25:13,338
Yours and mine,

436
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,506
except you flew the coop
with Klaus.

437
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,892
I already built
the foundation for the place.

438
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:20,178
I halted construction
after you took off.

439
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,397
Plan was to wait
for you to return.

440
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:23,898
You never did.

441
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,252
So now it's where I bury
the people who betray me.

442
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:28,686
You could've
come after me.

443
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:31,022
You were with Klaus.
I didn't know where.

444
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:33,241
I didn't know if you
still wanted to be with me.

445
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:34,676
All you had to do
was come home.

446
00:25:34,678 --> 00:25:36,211
It was more
complicated than that.

447
00:25:36,213 --> 00:25:37,379
Not long after
we left here,

448
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:38,546
he put a dagger
in my heart

449
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:40,382
and stuck me in
a box for 90 years.

450
00:25:40,384 --> 00:25:42,751
He stole a century from
me like it were nothing.

451
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:44,452
That's what he does,
Rebekah.

452
00:25:44,454 --> 00:25:45,971
Klaus will never
be happy.

453
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,205
He'll be damned if he
ever lets anyone

454
00:25:47,207 --> 00:25:48,757
get something that
he can't have.

455
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,874
I know.

456
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:50,992
I've been dancing
to this song

457
00:25:50,994 --> 00:25:52,377
for 1,000 years.

458
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:55,563
Starting right now,
you have a choice

459
00:25:55,565 --> 00:25:57,515
between the brother who
takes away your happiness

460
00:25:57,517 --> 00:25:59,818
whenever he feels like it
and the man who wants

461
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,270
to give you everything
you ever wanted.

462
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:10,228
He will kill you
in front of my eyes

463
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,247
out of spite.

464
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:15,617
Not if we get
rid of him first.

465
00:26:18,838 --> 00:26:21,089
Klaus
must have known.

466
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:24,042
That's the only
explanation.

467
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:25,543
He could care less
about the baby.

468
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:26,911
He just wants her
to be born

469
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:29,631
so he can use her to
make more sired hybrids.

470
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:35,920
Although the way
that Dwayne was acting,

471
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:39,474
it was more like
he was sired to me.

472
00:26:41,193 --> 00:26:44,762
I should
take you home.

473
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:48,033
Are you serious?
Home to what?

474
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,818
Look. Regardless
of my brother's intentions,

475
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,602
mine remain the same.

476
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:53,872
I said that I
would protect you,

477
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:56,491
even, if need be,
from Klaus himself.

478
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:59,277
I can take care
of myself.

479
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,296
I've done it
for a long time.

480
00:27:04,283 --> 00:27:06,968
Is this your idea
of revenge, Tyler,

481
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,753
grueling game
of hide-and-seek?

482
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:11,473
D'aagh!

483
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,228
Rraagh!

484
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:24,018
Let's end this,
shall we?

485
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,021
Raagh!
Raagh!

486
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,824
How dare you?

487
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:42,743
I'm just
getting started.

488
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:45,329
Aagh!

489
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:47,080
You've grown
bloodthirsty.

490
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,999
Perhaps it's best
your mother didn't live

491
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,450
to see you like this.

492
00:27:50,452 --> 00:27:53,086
Ha ha ha!

493
00:27:56,507 --> 00:27:59,293
Yah!

494
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,413
It's sad, really.

495
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:05,799
I thought
I made you better.

496
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,635
Turns out, you're
quite the disappointment.

497
00:28:08,637 --> 00:28:10,938
Yaah!

498
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,106
I guess I'm another one
of your failures,

499
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,859
like how you failed
at making hybrids,

500
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,894
how you failed
your family.

501
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:21,782
Now it looks like
you're even

502
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:24,818
gonna fail
your own kid.

503
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:28,655
And thus ends your
tedious, little life.

504
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:30,457
At least it was brief.

505
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:32,709
Yaagh! Ugh...

506
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:37,280
Do it.

507
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,050
You're never
gonna break me.

508
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,668
Only thing you
could do is kill me.

509
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,139
So go on. Go on.
Get it over with.

510
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,675
Ah...

511
00:28:48,677 --> 00:28:53,313
You want me to end
your suffering, don't you?

512
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:58,235
Hmm? I did break you,
took everything from you,

513
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,970
and now you're begging me
to sweep away the shards

514
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:04,024
of your shattered,
little life.

515
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,420
Death offers more peace
than you deserve.

516
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:18,505
It's better
to let you live,

517
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,657
and each morning,
you will wake knowing

518
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,510
that your wretched
existence continues

519
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:27,097
only by my will.

520
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,351
Now go and live
the rest of your days

521
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:36,556
knowing you
are nothing to me.

522
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,098
Do you know how many
fools have tried

523
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,700
to vanquish
my brother?

524
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,785
If you stand against
him, he will kill you,

525
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,737
and it will be
awful and bloody,

526
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:53,022
and I will not stand
around and watch.

527
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,960
You forget I have
a secret weapon... Davina,

528
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,413
the most powerful witch
in the last couple centuries.

529
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:02,749
What if she can find
a way to kill him?

530
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:07,304
You don't know,
do you?

531
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,955
You can't
kill Klaus,

532
00:30:08,957 --> 00:30:11,425
not without
dying yourself.

533
00:30:11,427 --> 00:30:12,592
We learned it
from the deaths

534
00:30:12,594 --> 00:30:13,727
of my brothers
Kol and Finn.

535
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,445
If an Original dies,
every vampire

536
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:18,632
ever made from their
line dies with him.

537
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:21,551
Even if you kill Klaus,
he'll still win.

538
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,437
It's been that way
for 1,000 years.

539
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,272
That's his trick.
He always wins.

540
00:30:25,274 --> 00:30:27,190
There's
another way.

541
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:29,192
What would that be?

542
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,361
We bury him
down here forever.

543
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,729
Are you mad?

544
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:34,164
This little chamber
of horrors may work

545
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,582
for your riffraff,
but do you really think

546
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,084
it will hold
my brother?

547
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:40,737
Isn't it worth the risk?
You know I'm right.

548
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,290
Klaus will never stop
trying to control you.

549
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,125
And I'm supposed
to believe

550
00:30:45,127 --> 00:30:48,428
that after a century,
suddenly you're willing

551
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,098
to risk death at
his hands to be with me?

552
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,016
I want to defend
my home.

553
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,835
I want to be free,
and if that means

554
00:30:54,837 --> 00:30:57,104
I get to be with you,

555
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:59,189
all the more reason
to bury him.

556
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:03,059
Now you tell me,
what do you want?

557
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,032
There you are.

558
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,284
I see you found
our wandering stray.

559
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,953
Perhaps she could
shed some light

560
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,489
on the situation.

561
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:18,325
This...

562
00:31:18,327 --> 00:31:21,277
Would appear to be
the body of a hybrid.

563
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,629
His name
was Dwayne.

564
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,448
Well, whoever he was,
I didn't sire him.

565
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,467
Any idea how
that's possible?

566
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:30,804
As if you
didn't know.

567
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,507
Ah...

568
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:37,561
Aren't you two
fast friends?

569
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,962
Well, come on, then.

570
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,847
What horrible accusation
have you conspired

571
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:42,849
to Levy against me?

572
00:31:42,851 --> 00:31:45,852
Tyler Lockwood brought Hayley
here to test a theory,

573
00:31:45,854 --> 00:31:50,440
that the blood of her child
could be used to sire hybrids.

574
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,243
He claims you knew that.

575
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,862
Furthermore,
you intended

576
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:58,915
to use this knowledge
to build an army.

577
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,484
And, of course, you
assume it's true.

578
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,820
I mean, why else
would I show

579
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,174
any interest in my
own flesh and blood?

580
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:08,992
A heartbroken,
little crybaby

581
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,710
points his finger at me,
and my own brother

582
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:15,432
falls in line,
eager to believe it.

583
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:18,101
How quickly you
assume the worst,

584
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:20,353
especially when
it comes from her.

585
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,855
Oh, spare me
you indignation.

586
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,007
When have you ever demonstrated
any kind of concern

587
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:25,559
towards Hayley
or her child

588
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:28,028
beyond your own
selfish pursuits,

589
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,197
and what was it
you once said to me?

590
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,450
"Every King
needs an heir."

591
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,735
My big brother,

592
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:38,187
so you doubt
my intentions.

593
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,858
Well, I can't say
I'm surprised.

594
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,077
Standing beside
the noble Elijah,

595
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,330
how can I be anything
but the lesser brother...

596
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:52,252
a liar, a manipulator,

597
00:32:52,254 --> 00:32:55,055
a bastard?

598
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,928
That's all I am
to you, isn't it,

599
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,264
and to Rebekah,
and judging

600
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,650
by the way Hayley hangs
on your every word,

601
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:10,386
it's clear she feels
the same way.

602
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,573
No doubt, my child
will, as well.

603
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,742
Brother, if I...

604
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:19,663
we've said all that
needs to be said,

605
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,948
brother.

606
00:33:27,237 --> 00:33:31,708
I'll play the role
I've been given.

607
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,878
Agh!
Klaus!

608
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,597
Oh...

609
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,249
You two enjoy each
other's company.

610
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,687
You'll have much
to bond over

611
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:48,224
once the hallucinations
and dementia set in.

612
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,360
Consider that bite

613
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,530
my parting gift
to you both.

614
00:34:10,593 --> 00:34:12,627
Oh...

615
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,597
That's it.

616
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,933
You're free.

617
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:22,887
Uh...

618
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:29,527
You're right.
I can feel it.

619
00:34:29,529 --> 00:34:31,362
Before, I was
always thinking

620
00:34:31,364 --> 00:34:33,281
about what Klaus
would want me to do.

621
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:38,236
Now I'm like ,
"screw that guy."

622
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:40,604
Ha! Ha ha ha!

623
00:34:40,606 --> 00:34:44,625
Klaus Mikaelson
can suck it. Ha!

624
00:34:49,098 --> 00:34:53,668
What? What's
that look for?

625
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:57,839
Marcel wants me to make you
forget about me.

626
00:34:57,841 --> 00:35:01,476
Oh, well, you don't
have to do that.

627
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:04,762
I owe you my life.

628
00:35:06,298 --> 00:35:08,933
I'll keep
your secret.

629
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:14,989
Besides,
it's kind of nice

630
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:17,942
just talking to someone
normal again.

631
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:20,411
You think I'm normal?

632
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:23,031
I'm a 16-year-old witch
living in a church attic

633
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:26,134
like some kind
of freak.

634
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:27,985
I'm a gay club kid
who died

635
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:29,754
and came back
as a vampire.

636
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:32,507
Ha ha!
Yeah.

637
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:36,794
Normal is kind of
relative, you know?

638
00:35:36,796 --> 00:35:39,881
Here.
Pinky swear on it.

639
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:49,507
You don't
have to help.

640
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:51,692
I can dig through the
werewolf antique show

641
00:35:51,694 --> 00:35:54,362
on my own.

642
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,364
Besides, shouldn't
you put some kind

643
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:58,900
of ointment or
something on that?

644
00:35:58,902 --> 00:36:01,452
The bite
won't kill me.

645
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:03,671
Like Niklaus himself,
it's more of a nuisance

646
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,206
than anything,
really.

647
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,075
Good, because
I'm eventually

648
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:10,211
gonna need
a ride home...

649
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,365
And thanks,
by the way,

650
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,883
for staying
out here.

651
00:36:15,885 --> 00:36:17,135
You didn't have to.

652
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:22,039
I know,
but you said

653
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:23,724
the people
of this village

654
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:26,394
are all of the family
you have left.

655
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,981
I can relate.

656
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,553
You're thinking
about Klaus.

657
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:40,408
Perhaps I was too willing
to condemn him.

658
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,743
In the 1,000 years
that we have been together,

659
00:36:42,745 --> 00:36:46,297
my brother has committed
numerous unspeakable acts,

660
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,366
but, then again,
so has Rebekah.

661
00:36:48,368 --> 00:36:49,784
So have I.

662
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:52,136
So did I the last
time I was in Cabo.

663
00:36:52,138 --> 00:36:54,255
We all do bad things.

664
00:36:54,257 --> 00:36:55,840
It's just,
most people die

665
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:59,127
before the list
gets embarrassing,

666
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,429
but don't
for a second

667
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:05,216
compare yourself
to Klaus.

668
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,024
Heh.

669
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:16,527
It's like a freaking
hotbox in here.

670
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,946
I'm gonna
get some air.

671
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:42,003
Someone
left this here.

672
00:37:42,005 --> 00:37:44,639
What is it?

673
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:47,175
A Bible with
a family tree

674
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:51,229
that goes back
generations.

675
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:55,850
What are these names?
Who is Andrea?

676
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:04,475
I think I am.

677
00:38:04,477 --> 00:38:07,078
That's the day
that I was born.

678
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:22,093
I thought you
were leaving us.

679
00:38:22,095 --> 00:38:23,594
We both know
this family

680
00:38:23,596 --> 00:38:25,479
can barely function
without me.

681
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:27,682
Where are Elijah
and Hayley?

682
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:31,102
I left them
in the bayou.

683
00:38:31,104 --> 00:38:32,887
Why?

684
00:38:32,889 --> 00:38:36,224
Elijah and I had
a bit of a row.

685
00:38:36,226 --> 00:38:38,526
Ha ha ha!

686
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:42,179
Hayley has conspired
to turn him against me,

687
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:44,031
and you know our brother
never was one

688
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:46,284
to resist
a pretty face.

689
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:51,522
So one thing led to
another, and I bit him,

690
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:53,874
left them both
stranded in the swamp.

691
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:56,277
Daggering, biting,
deserting.

692
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:57,712
Does your wickedness
ever end?

693
00:38:57,714 --> 00:39:01,048
My wickedness
is self-preservation,

694
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,883
and I wouldn't have
to go to such lengths

695
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,635
were I not beset
on all sides

696
00:39:04,637 --> 00:39:08,306
by incompetence
and treachery.

697
00:39:08,308 --> 00:39:11,309
Now that Elijah
has abandoned me,

698
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:15,263
I'll be needing you
in my plot against Marcel.

699
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:21,235
Don't expect to be
leaving town any time soon.

700
00:39:21,237 --> 00:39:22,270
Why should
I help you

701
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:25,106
after what you
did to Elijah?

702
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:34,665
You're my family.

703
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:38,235
Besides, who better
to spy on Marcel

704
00:39:38,237 --> 00:39:42,340
than the girl he
so clearly loves?

705
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:45,626
You can tell me
all his secrets,

706
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:50,931
like how did he
find us here, huh?

707
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,485
Any idea about that,
little sister?

708
00:39:56,805 --> 00:39:58,639
How should I know
why Marcel

709
00:39:58,641 --> 00:40:00,524
does what he does?

710
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:04,312
You think I don't know
about your engineered run-ins

711
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,929
all over the quarter?

712
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:09,967
I know you've had
private chats with him.

713
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:15,656
So just tell me what secrets
he's confided to you.

714
00:40:15,658 --> 00:40:18,959
Is he plotting
against me?

715
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:30,004
My poor brother,
so paranoid.

716
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:33,057
Marcel
knows nothing.

717
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:35,059
He is not plotting
against you.

718
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:36,627
He simply thinks
you're in a quarrel,

719
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:38,646
in need
of making up.

720
00:40:43,268 --> 00:40:46,970
Perhaps we will.

721
00:40:46,972 --> 00:40:50,991
After all, you know I'm
capable of forgiving

722
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:54,578
those who disappoint me
soon as they've seen

723
00:40:54,580 --> 00:41:00,534
the errof their ways
and suffered for them.

724
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:03,921
You'd do well
to remember that.

725
00:41:07,158 --> 00:41:10,010
You never
let me forget.

726
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,888
You want to make
a deal with me,

727
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,440
you got to offer me
something.

728
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:25,192
I already know about
Hayley the werewolf girl.

729
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:28,396
What else you got?

730
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:30,898
What if I told you
that werewolf girl

731
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:33,234
is carrying
Klaus' child...

732
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:38,706
And if that baby
is born,

733
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:41,909
it'll mean the end
of the vampire species?

734
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:54,899
