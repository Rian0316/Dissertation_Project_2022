1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,259
我和我的兄弟姊妹
KLAUS: My siblings and I

2
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,028
是历史上最早的吸血鬼
are the first vampires
in all of history.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,737
是真祖家族
The Originals.

4
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:11,172
和他们不同的是，我是混合种
半吸血鬼半狼人
Unlike them, I am a Hybrid,
half vampire, half werewolf.

5
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,236
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
Three hundred years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:17,844
现在我们回来了
被一群女巫引回来
Now, we've returned,
drawn back by a coven of witches

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,986
她们威胁着怀了我孩子的女人
who threatened the woman
carrying my child.

8
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,485
那个孩子会让我们都死去
That baby will bring
death to us all.

9
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,652
我哥哥以利亚和她们交涉过
KLAUS: My brother
Elijah dealt with them.

10
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,884
没人在伤害我的家人后能安然无恙
No one hurts
my family and lives.

11
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:31,658
我们以为海莉就会安全了
KLAUS: We thought Hayley
would be safe.

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,991
我是马赛尔
I'm Marcel.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,458
我们好像没见过
I don't think we've met.

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,463
海莉不见了，她在哪？
Hayley is gone.
Where is she?

15
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,693
什么？
What?

16
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,504
马赛尔来过这里了
Marcel was here.

17
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,533
我们都错了
KLAUS: We were wrong.

18
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,299
女士们，先生们
Ladies, gentlemen...

19
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:14,099
欢迎来到决战之夜
...welcome to fight night!

20
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,907
决战之夜的第一条规则就是
And the first rule of fight night is,

21
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,482
今晚能够撑到最后的那个吸血鬼
the vampire left standing
at the end of the night

22
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,051
离进入我的亲信圈
is one step closer to the inner circle...

23
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,118
和这样的一枚日光戒指
and one of these...

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,689
就更近一步了
A daylight ring.

25
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:35,194
如果你们能用一点点的
极端暴力让我留下印象
If you can impress me
with a little ultra-violence,

26
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,819
同样也可以享受太阳照射在脸上的温暖
you too can enjoy the warmth
of the sun on your face.

27
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:42,731
你们所要做的，就是尽力决战
All you got to do
is kick a little ass.

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,296
开始吧
So, here we go.

29
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,975
首先出场的两位竞争者
Our first two contenders...

30
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,671
费莉西亚和奥托
...Felicia and Otto.

31
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,716
该死，妹子，不错嘛
Damn, girl, not bad.

32
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,986
晚安
Good evening.

33
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:42,485
我要说几句
I'd like a word.

34
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,224
你在干什么？
What do you think you're doing?

35
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:47,031
显然我们打断了
It appears that we've interrupted

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,225
一群脏兮兮的业余爱好者
a collection of filthy amateurs.

37
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:53,829
我们是为那个女孩来的
We've come here for the girl.

38
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,565
把她给我们，否则…
Give her to us, or...

39
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:57,838
我们就杀光这里所有人
...we kill everyone here.

40
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,603
从你开始
Starting with you.

41
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,239
你们俩真是太有勇气了
You two got a lot of nerve

42
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,976
居然来到我的地盘提要求
coming into my home
and making demands.

43
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,583
你的地盘，是吗？
You're home, is it?

44
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,587
那个女孩，我不会再说一次了
The girl.
I will not ask again.

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,648
我想你说的是海莉吧
I assume you're
talking about Hayley...

46
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:16,593
这么高，深色头发，态度傲慢
yay high, dark hair,
bitchy attitude.

47
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,085
对了，她是谁？
Who is she, anyway?

48
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,960
一位老朋友
She's an old friend.

49
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,393
你知道我对老朋友多有感情
You know how sentimental
I am about old friends.

50
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,395
她不在我手上
Well, I ain't got her,

51
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,538
在你们开始发牢骚之前
and before you start whining,

52
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,902
我承认今天晚上拜访过她
I did pay her a little visit
earlier tonight.

53
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,566
我感觉有点怀旧
I was feeling nostalgic.

54
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:33,837
所以我就去了种植园
So I took a trip out
to the plantation

55
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,810
我曾在那里做过奴隶
where I used to be a slave,

56
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,711
想像一下我有多惊讶
and imagine my surprise...

57
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,682
当我发现吸血鬼真祖家族
...when I realized that the
Original family of vampires

58
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,584
居然住在那里
had taken up residence.

59
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:47,421
你们的女孩海莉应了门
Your girl,Hayley, answered the door.

60
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:50,358
我们互相打了招呼，仅此而已
We exchanged hellos.
That was it.

61
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,224
你们不信就四处看看吧
You don't believe me,
look around.

62
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,831
我还会帮你们找她的
Hell, I'll even help you find her.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
但我要问的是
But the question that I'd ask is...

64
00:03:57,537 --> 00:03:58,970
如果海莉不在这里
If Hayley isn't here...

65
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,663
那她在哪？
...then where is she?

66
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:36,530
来真的啊？
Seriously?

67
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,000
泰勒？
Tyler?

68
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,840
你不会想跟我打的，海莉
你知道你没法打赢混合种
You don't want to fight me, Hayley.
You know you can't beat a Hybrid.

69
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,774
放开我
Let me go,

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,442
你这个卑鄙的混血杂…
you backstabbing,
half-breed piece of sh--

71
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,951
闭嘴！
Shut up!

72
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,357
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：血腥杀戮

73
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,431
并不是很招人喜欢的群体，不是吗？
ELlJAH: Not the most
attractive community, are they?

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,261
你知道他们能听见你说话
You do realize they can hear you.

75
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:03,969
你知道我不在乎
You do realize I don't care.

76
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,702
以利亚
主演：约瑟夫摩根
You know, Elijah,

77
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,140
我更喜欢你待在棺材里
I liked you better in that box,

78
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,843
但是克劳斯，我的父亲
我对你无限感激
but, Klaus, my sire,
you I owe the world...

79
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,810
而且我向来尊重长辈
...and I always show respect
to my elders.

80
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,709
如果你们特别的女性朋友失踪了
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
If your special
lady friend is missing,

81
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,182
你们可以找个女巫帮你们
主演：克莱儿荷特
you can benefit
from the help of a witch,

82
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,620
既然我控制着城里的所有女巫
and since I control
all the witches in this town,

83
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,851
我允许你们使用一个小小的定位咒
I'll grant you one little locator spell.

84
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,460
莎宾是法语区最好的导游
主演：菲比托金
Sabine is the best guide
in the Quarter.

85
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,923
如果你们要找人
You need to find someone,

86
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,587
我保证她可以帮上忙
I guarantee she's your girl.

87
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,530
你去哪？
Where are you going?

88
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:39,201
我真的很想继续聊
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
但太阳就快要升起了
I hate to cut this short,
but the sun is coming up soon.

89
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,804
我的夜行者们得回到屋内
My nightwalkers
need to get inside,

90
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,235
而我还有一个城市要管理
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
and I've got a city to run.

91
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,301
你们就自己寻找你们的迷途羔羊吧
I'll leave you to track down
your lost sheep.

92
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:52,679
你能找到她吗？
Can you find her?

93
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,709
可以试试
I can try.

94
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:58,353
主演：莉雅派普斯

95
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,057
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔

96
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,398
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

97
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,633
路易斯安那的一处
The armpit of Louisiana.

98
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,001
你拿那个做什么？
What are you gonna do with that?

99
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,171
这就看你了
Depends on you.

100
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,968
嘿，是你攻击我的，记得吗？
Hey, you attacked me, remember?

101
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,537
你在我家后院埋伏我
You ambushed me
in my own back yard.

102
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,647
那不是你家后院，是克劳斯的
It's not your back yard.
It's Klaus'.

103
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,446
你只是和那个疯子住在那个房子里
You're shacked up in a mansion
with that psycho,

104
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:27,381
和我在阿帕拉契山脉认识的
a long way from the girl
I met in the Appalachians

105
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,747
帮助其他狼人的女孩完全两样
helping other werewolves.

106
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:31,081
泰勒，对不起
但自从我最后一次见你之后
Tyler, I'm sorry,
but a lot has happened

107
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,884
发生了许多事
since the last time I saw you.

108
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,821
比如你是如何怀孕的吗？
You mean like
how you're pregnant?

109
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:40,190
混合种婴儿，是的，我都知道了
A Hybrid baby. Yeah.
I know all about it.

110
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,266
我一直在河口
I've been roaming

111
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,663
四处打探
around the bayou asking questions.

112
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,600
我来告诉你我打听到了什么
Let me tell you what I learned.

113
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,704
这个新月胎记意味着你来自
This crescent birthmark
means you come

114
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,502
一个重要的家族
算是这个地区
from a big shot family,
some kind of royalty

115
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:51,973
狼人的皇族
to the werewolves
of this region,

116
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,576
就是这里
制片：兰斯安德森
and right here...

117
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,675
这就是他们仅剩的了
This is all that's left of them.

118
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,686
嘿，帮帮我
Hey, help me.

119
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,292
他们帮不了你
They can't help you.

120
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,554
他们躲藏在树林里
They're in the woods hiding

121
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,926
因为他们被吸血鬼迫害了数十年
because they've been persecuted
for decades by vampires.

122
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,130
是她吗？
Is that her?

123
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,832
是的，杜恩
带她进去
Yeah, Dwayne.
Get her inside.

124
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,210
泰勒？泰勒？
Tyler? Tyler?

125
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:36,412
她在很偏远的地方
She's in the back country.

126
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,683
在霍玛一带，河口深处
Way out past Houma,
deep in the bayou.

127
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:41,754
我也不指望你能说得更具体
I don't suppose
you could be more precise.

128
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,020
怎么了，以利亚？
What's the matter, Elijah?

129
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,353
你担心沼泽溅起的泥水
Are you worried a bit of
splashing about in the bog

130
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:47,123
会毁掉你昂贵的鞋子吗？
might ruin
your expensive shoes?

131
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,301
事实上，在经历了最近的囚禁之后
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
As a matter of fact,
after my recent confinement,

132
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,164
我可以优雅地穿过乡野
I could use a decent stroll
through the countryside.

133
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:54,101
那里有被驱逐的狼人的传说
There are stories of exiled werewolves.

134
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:55,930
他们的营地
Encampments.

135
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,542
如果海莉真去了那么远
很有可能她是去找他们了
If Hayley went out that far,
chances are, she went to find them.

136
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,213
显然她希望结交更多同种族的人
Clearly, she hopes to make the
acquaintance of more like herself.

137
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,907
我想我们的陪伴可能不够好呢
I suppose our company
wasn't good enough for her.

138
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,863
编剧：麦可鲁梭
麦克纳度奇

139
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,371
你可以随时加入他们的
导演：杰弗利亨特
You could always join them, you know.

140
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:29,341
喝酒游戏
Ah, drinking games.

141
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,210
我不是很喜欢
It's not really my thing.

142
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,743
有点让我想起中学时的那些运动员
It kind of reminds me of the jocks
in my high school.

143
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,174
我们学校有很多你们说的
We had a pretty high quota
of what you'd call

144
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,908
混帐东西
douche nozzles.

145
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,649
- 恶霸啊？
- 是啊
-Bullies, huh?
-Yeah.

146
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,520
很好奇如果你现在看到那些家伙会怎样
Wonder what'd happen if
you saw those guys now.

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,954
我敢说你一定会撕碎他们的，对吧？
I bet you'd tear them apart, right?

148
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,120
是啊，当然
Yeah, totally.

149
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,931
可能会把所有吸血鬼的招数
都用在他们身上
Probably go all vamp ninja on 'em.

150
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,997
你是个有趣的家伙，小约
You're a funny guy, Josh.

151
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,732
事实上，我觉得昨晚真的很有趣
你知道吗？
In fact, I thought it was really
funny last night, you know?

152
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:03,805
看到你在克劳斯住的那个种植园里
Seeing you at that plantation
where Klaus is staying.

153
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,481
你要去什么地方吗，小约？
You going somewhere, Josh?

154
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,389
我们应该朝南向水边走
We should head south
towards the water.

155
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,954
你似乎下定决心要找到那只小狼
You seem quite determined
to find the little wolf.

156
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,717
如果你觉得我走太快了，尼克劳斯
If I'm moving too fast for you, Niklaus,

157
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,294
你可以去车里等着
you're welcome to wait in the car.

158
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,928
不过要保证不许把窗户摇上
Do be certain to leave
the windows down.

159
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,623
我碰到你的痛处了吧
So, I've touched a nerve.

160
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,701
你开始欣赏这个女孩了
You've begun to admire this girl.

161
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,095
也许这就是为什么你一回来就开始
Perhaps that's why
you've been barking orders

162
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,570
厉声下命今
希望透过扮演家长的角色
since your return,
hoping to impress Hayley

163
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,504
让海莉留下好印象
by assuming the role of family patriarch.

164
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,043
如果你想坚持把她当作活动的孵卵器
You want to insist on treating her
like a walking incubator,

165
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:41,975
那就是你的错
then that's your mistake.

166
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:46,107
你发现她的气味了吗？
Have you found her scent?

167
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,186
没有
No.

168
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,680
但我发现其他人的了
But I found someone else's.

169
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,860
这辆车散发着某个
This vehicle reeks...

170
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,162
我以为除掉的人的臭味
...of someone I thought
I was rid of....

171
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,322
泰勒洛克伍
Tyler Lockwood.

172
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,798
为什么你迷瀑镇的混合种小跟班
And why would your
little Hybrid sidekick from Mystic Falls

173
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,064
对海莉有兴趣呢？
have any interest in Hayley?

174
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,673
他想要复仇，因为我追求了他的女朋友
He wants revenge
because I went after his girl.

175
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,374
为什么我怀疑这又是你的错呢？
Why do I suspect this
is the least of your offenses?

176
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,673
在我还有办法转变混合种时
Back when I had the means
to sire Hybrids,

177
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,008
他是我的第一个
he was my first.

178
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:22,448
尽管在这件事上我没给他多少选择
Although I didn't give him
much choice in the matter.

179
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,588
一开始他很忠诚
He was loyal in the beginning,

180
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,226
但慢慢就开始不听话了
but he grew insubordinate.

181
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,861
还让我其他的混合种都与我作对
Turned my other Hybrids
against me.

182
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,360
我无法容忍
I couldn't have that.

183
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,199
所以我就杀了很多混合种
So, I massacred
the lot of them.

184
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,397
在我了结泰勒之前
Tyler ran like a coward

185
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,199
他就像个懦夫一样逃走了
before I could finish him off.

186
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,033
你还有什么要说的吗？
Anything else that
you would like to share?

187
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,036
还有和他妈妈有关的事情
Well, there was
this business with his mum.

188
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,610
你杀了他母亲，好极了
You killed his mother.
Wonderful.

189
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,680
他应该得到教训
He needed to be taught a lesson.

190
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,378
你又该得到什么教训呢，尼克劳斯
And what lesson will
you be taught, Niklaus,

191
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,113
如果他透过伤害海莉来报复？
if he retaliates by harming Hayley?

192
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,485
所以你的确是在乎她的
So you do care about her.

193
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,019
那就去啊
Well, go on, then.

194
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:03,718
去吧，哥哥，去救她
Have at it, brother.
Save her.

195
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:06,456
索求你的战利品
她的一切我都尝过了
Claim what spoils you can.
I've sampled what she has to offer,

196
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,463
让我告诉你，她可是妙不可言呢
and, let me tell you,
she is exquisite.

197
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,726
尼克劳斯，帮帮我…
Niklaus, so help me--

198
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:11,267
够了
Enough.

199
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,307
我会亲手杀了泰勒洛克伍
I'll kill
Tyler Lockwood myself.

200
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,211
马赛尔，有情况
Marcel, something is happening.

201
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,876
法语区有女巫在施魔法
There's a witch doing
magic in the Quarter.

202
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,886
别担心，那是我批准的
Oh, no worries.
That one is Marcel-approved.

203
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:31,989
除此之外…
Besides...

204
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:35,790
还有别的东西需要你处理
(JOSH GROANS)
I got something else
for you to handle.

205
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,163
不，你就是那个超级女巫
Oh, no.
You're the super witch.

206
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:47,799
和小约打个招呼吧
Say hi to Josh.

207
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,565
你为什么把他带来这里？
Why would you bring him here?

208
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:51,242
小约有个问题
Josh has a problem.

209
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,275
克劳斯魅惑他监视我
Klaus compelled him
to spy on me.

210
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,313
我不能容忍
I can't have that.

211
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,746
所以我就想“我要杀了小约”
So I thought,
"I'll just kill Josh."

212
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,781
马赛尔，求求你，这不是我的错
Marcel, please.
It's not my fault.

213
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,477
然后我又想“杀死一个吸血鬼
Then I thought,
"Killing a vampire,

214
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,179
会坏了我自己的规矩”
that would be breaking
my own rule."

215
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,914
聪明的做法就是让他回到我这边来
Smart thing to do is to flip Josh.

216
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,219
那样他就可以告诉把我想说的
告诉克劳斯
That way, he can tell Klaus
whatever I want.

217
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,161
甚至可以替我监视他
He could even spy for me.

218
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,320
我们只要抹去克劳斯对他的魅惑
All we got to do
is wipe away that compulsion.

219
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,295
你觉得怎么样？
So, what do you think?

220
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,868
我可以让他忘记克劳斯跟他说的话
I can make him forget
what Klaus told him,

221
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,994
但克劳斯说得越多
but the more Klaus said,

222
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,604
就会越痛
the more it's gonna hurt.

223
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,301
可能会非常痛呢
Probably gonna hurt a lot.

224
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,366
小约？
Josh?

225
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,108
我可以
I'll do it.

226
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,304
做什么都可以
Anything, yes.

227
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,677
到底有多痛？
How much pain are we talking?

228
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,796
泰勒，最近一直有只狼看护着我
Tyler, there has been a wolf,
watching me lately.

229
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,600
保护着我，就好像他本能地知道
我是他一族的
Protecting me like it instinctively
knows that I am part of its pack.

230
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,775
你是混合种
你可以随时变成狼
You're a Hybrid. You can turn into
a wolf whenever you want.

231
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,214
是你吗？
Was it you?

232
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:05,647
不是，但你说得对
No.
But you're right.

233
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,076
只有混合种才能控制自己何时变身
Only Hybrids can control,
when they change.

234
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,154
而我是除了克劳斯之外唯一的混合种
And I'm the only one left
besides Klaus.

235
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,755
所以我们才在这里
Which is why we're here.

236
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,516
不管你以为自己在做什么
Whatever you think you're doing,

237
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,592
你知道真祖家族都…
you know that
whole Original family

238
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,592
订下了约定什么的
has made some sort of
pact or something

239
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,253
确保我和孩子的安全
to keep me and the baby safe.

240
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,297
如果你伤害我，他们会杀了你的
So, if you hurt me,
they'll kill you.

241
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,203
你凭什么觉得我怕死？
What makes you think
I'm afraid to die?

242
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,674
你准备好了吗？
Are you ready for this?

243
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,208
动手吧
Let's do it.

244
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,515
你们要干什么？
What are you doing?

245
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,352
泰勒，拜托，不要，泰勒
Tyler, please.
No. Tyler!

246
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,954
克劳斯毁了我生命中所有美好的事情
Klaus destroyed everything
good in my life.

247
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:46,582
所以我就要夺走他最想要的东西
So I'm gonna take away
the thing he wants most.

248
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,420
不要，拜托，泰勒，求求你
No, please! Tyler, please!

249
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:30,025
我以为你离开了
没法袖手旁观，是吗？
I thought you were leaving town.
Couldn't stay away, huh?

250
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,239
我已经穿过半个路易斯安那州
才发现你入侵了我家
I was half past Louisiana when
I found out you invaded our home.

251
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,999
你对海莉做了什么？
What have you done
with Hayley?

252
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,238
你生气的时候真性感
You're so hot when you're angry.

253
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:46,984
你利用了我
You used me!

254
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,481
我确定那是相互的
I'm pretty sure that was mutual.

255
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,180
被你的魅力所骗
我像傻瓜一样和你睡了
Beguiled by your charms,
I slept with you like a fool,

256
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,656
把你带去了我家，然后你就带走了海莉
Ied you to our home,
and then you took Hayley.

257
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,691
我没有带走任何人
Whoa, I didn't take anybody.

258
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,524
我已经和你哥哥们澄清这件事了
I already sorted this out
with your brothers.

259
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:01,230
别回避问题
But it begs the question...

260
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:03,790
你为什么回来？
...why'd you come back?

261
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,459
如果克劳斯知道你找到
If Klaus learns it's my fault

262
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:06,969
种植园是因为我…
you found your way
to the plantation--

263
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,766
你真觉得我会出卖你吗？
You really think I'd rat you out?

264
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,063
行了吧
Come on.

265
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,107
如果你觉得我在一千年里
If you think that
I'd ever in 1,000 years

266
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,939
会做出什么事伤害你
do anything to hurt you,

267
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,009
你就是错把我当作克劳斯了
you got me confused with Klaus.

268
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,084
你的魅力和挑逗
All your charms and flirtations...

269
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,952
足够证明你就是和克劳斯一样的
...simply prove you're every bit the liar

270
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,647
骗子和操控者
and manipulator that Klaus is,

271
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,056
你真的这么想吗？
Is that what you really think?

272
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,956
请一定要证明我错了
By all means, prove me wrong.

273
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,858
好吧，跟我来
Fine. Come on.

274
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,793
有样东西要给你看
Something you need to see.

275
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,946
别想批判我
Don't get all judge-y.

276
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:51,679
杜恩知道自己卷入了何事
Dwayne knew what he was getting into.

277
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,479
他是自愿的
He volunteered.

278
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:54,913
让你杀了他吗？
For you to kill him?

279
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,984
杜恩是狼人，死时身体里有你的血
Dwayne is a werewolf who died
with your blood in his system,

280
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,250
你和你的混合种宝宝共有的血
same blood you share
with your Hybrid baby.

281
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,360
你想把他变成混合种
那是不可能的
You're trying to turn him into a Hybrid.
That's impossible.

282
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,289
和这一带的狼群都交流过后
Been running with wolf packs
all over the country.

283
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,459
其中有一个和一个女巫关系很不错
One of them was tight
with a witch.

284
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:12,632
她噩梦中有你孩子的幻象
She had nightmare visions
about your baby

285
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,933
以及克劳斯如何利用它的血
来建造一支混合种奴隶军队
and how Klaus could use its blood
to make an army of Hybrid slaves.

286
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,268
我受够了这些女巫
I am sick of these witches

287
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:19,206
还有关于我孩子的预言
and the premonitions
about my baby.

288
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,606
这只是个孩子
It's just a baby.

289
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,974
也许是，也许不是
Maybe. Maybe not.

290
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,306
所以杜恩才会来
That's where Dwayne comes in.

291
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,347
你看，他很乐意做试验品
You see, he was happy
to be the test case.

292
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,283
你还没有注意到吧
这些人的生活没什么指望
If you haven't noticed,
these people don't have much to live for.

293
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,821
他们很乐意接受成为
They'd all welcome the chance

294
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,288
上等物种的机会
to become the superior species.

295
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:36,223
问题是，所有混合种都是克劳斯转变的
Trouble is,
all Hybrids are sired to Klaus.

296
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,661
他们对他言听计从
They follow his every move.

297
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,560
我不可能让这一切发生的
No way I'd let that happen.

298
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,894
你怎么就这么确定克劳斯知道
How can you be
so sure Klaus knows

299
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:48,630
这孩子的血能做什么？
what the baby's blood will do?

300
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:49,932
你觉得呢？
What do you think?

301
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,440
克劳斯米卡森
Klaus Mikaelson,

302
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,972
男人、女人、小狗的杀手
killer of men, women, and puppies,

303
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:54,772
突然之间想要做爸爸了？
all of a sudden
wants to be a daddy?

304
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,175
或者说他根本就别有用心
Or he's got an ulterior motive.

305
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,309
混合种可以在阳光下行走
Hybrids can walk in the sun.

306
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,249
他们咬一口就可以让吸血鬼死亡
Their bite is lethal to vampires.

307
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,783
一周时间他们就能接管纽奥良
They'll take over New Orleans
by the end of the week,

308
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,720
你知道那时什么才能阻止克劳斯吗？
and you know what's
gonna stop Klaus then?

309
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,457
什么都阻止不了
Nothing.

310
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,560
你得吸她的血
You're gonna have to feed on her.

311
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,295
什么？不要
What? No.

312
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,102
快点
Do it.

313
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,982
杜恩，放轻松
Dwayne?
Easy.

314
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:56,201
看着我
Look at me.

315
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,566
看着我
Look at me!

316
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,481
你没事了
You're okay.

317
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,649
我好得很
I'm better than okay.

318
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,062
抱歉，但这样只会更糟
I'm sorry,
but it's just gonna get worse.

319
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:29,968
克劳斯的魅惑太深了
Klaus' compulsion runs deep.

320
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,238
你得想想其他事情
You need to think of something else.

321
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:34,668
尽量不去想这个
Take your mind off it.

322
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,075
你喜欢音乐吗？
Do you like music?

323
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,917
什么？什么？
What? Wha--?

324
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,945
我现在没法想音乐
I can't think
about music right now.

325
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,816
为什么？我不知道
Why? I don't know.

326
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,357
也许是因为你给我施了巫毒脑叶切除术
Maybe because you're
giving me a voodoo lobotomy.

327
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,394
你喜欢爵士乐吗？
Do you like jazz?

328
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,024
那你喜欢什么？
So what, then?

329
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,936
夜店那种
Club stuff.

330
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,669
浩室舞曲、出神舞曲，你懂的
House, trance, you know....

331
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,670
我是女巫，不是阿米希人
I'm a witch.
I'm not Amish.

332
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:08,980
我才16岁，我不去夜店
It's just I'm only 16.
I don't go to clubs.

333
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,740
我16岁时都去过上百家夜店了
When I was 16,
I'd been to, like, a hundred clubs.

334
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,618
天哪，这才是四年前
God, it was only four years ago.

335
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,020
感觉却像是上辈子
Feels like another life.

336
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:32,101
我当时只想认识新朋友
All I wanted to do was meet boys.

337
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,603
事情却变得非常复杂
Things are so much more complicated.

338
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,277
现在我只想认识新朋友
I mean, now all I want
to do is meet boys

339
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,777
吸人类的血
and feed
on people's blood...

340
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:46,477
得到一枚日光戒指
Get one of those daylight rings

341
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,449
这样我就不会被阳光灼伤
so I don't burn in the sunlight.

342
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,689
都是些再正常不过的东西了
All perfectly normal things.

343
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,324
我喜欢古典乐
I like the classics.

344
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,232
普契尼、巴哈、莫札特
Puccini, Bach, Mozart.

345
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,060
我学过钢琴
I took piano.

346
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:08,896
不过被困在这后也没什么意义了
Not that it matters
while I'm stuck here.

347
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,535
为什么？
Why not?

348
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,682
马赛尔担心会有人听到琴声
Marcel is worried
that someone could hear.

349
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,809
这不是他的错
It's not his fault.

350
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,543
他只是想保护我
He just wants to keep me safe.

351
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,278
保护你什么？
Safe from what?

352
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,786
简单来说，就是一群疯婆子女巫
Basically, a coven of psycho witches

353
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,929
想让我在一场血祭上当祭品
want to sacrifice me
in a blood ritual.

354
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:35,460
原来是这样，好吧
Oh, wow. Okay.

355
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:38,228
我很…遗憾？
Uh, I'm sorry?

356
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,236
没关孙，我会将她们全部消灭
Don't be.
I'm gonna destroy them all.

357
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,634
一旦她们不复存在
And once they're gone,

358
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,709
一切将会恢复正常
everything will go back to normal.

359
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,371
我也能过回原来的生活
I'll have my old life back.

360
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,218
成功了，是吗？
他成为混合种了
It worked, didn't it?
He's a Hybrid.

361
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,690
如果你落到克劳斯手里
If Klaus gets a hold of you,

362
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,989
如果他控制了那个孩子，他就赢了
if he gets that kid, he wins.

363
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,290
那就帮我把孩子藏起来
Then help me hide the baby from him.

364
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,568
帮助我逃跑
Help me run.

365
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,795
他会找到你的
He'll find you.

366
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,165
他会夺走你的孩子
He'll take your kid away,

367
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,002
然后制造更多凶残的混合种
and he'll make
more Hybrid monsters.

368
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,206
服从他一切命令的奴隶
Slaves who do everything he says.

369
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,973
泰勒，无论你想做什么
Tyler, whatever you're
thinking of doing,

370
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,342
总会有另一种方法的
there has to be another way.

371
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:25,813
你不是这样的人
You're not like this.

372
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,089
这么做太愚蠢了
That was stupid.

373
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,527
离她远点
Get away from her.

374
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,019
- 你管得着吗？
- 我说，离她远点
-What do you care?
-I said, get away.

375
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,687
你已经如愿以偿了，快滚
You got what you wanted.
Now get lost.

376
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,265
杜恩，他想杀了我
Dwayne, he's gonna kill me.

377
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,735
他也想杀了你
And he's gonna kill you, too.

378
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,303
他说混合种存在这世上太危险了
He said that Hybrids
are too dangerous to live.

379
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,496
你一定要阻止他
You need to stop him.

380
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,005
你给我闭嘴
Shut up!

381
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,808
抱歉
Forgive me.

382
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,569
我还以为你有危险
Thought you were in danger.

383
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,804
看来是我想错了
It appears I was mistaken.

384
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,716
你绝对想不到我今天过得有多糟
You will not believe the crap day
that I'm having.

385
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:45,861
我带你回家
Let me take you home.

386
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,793
以利亚
Elijah?

387
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,362
关于孩子，有些事情我想告诉你
There's something you need
to know about the baby.

388
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,199
海莉
Hayley?

389
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,366
别让事情变得更复杂
Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

390
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:02,777
放弃抵抗吧
Give up now.

391
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,781
我会给你个痛快的
I'll end it quick.

392
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,775
真是不错的提议
KLAUS: Quite an offer.

393
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,114
但我可就不会这样对你了
Though not one
I'll be extending to you.

394
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,585
克劳斯
Klaus.

395
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,424
你好，泰勒
你气色不错
Hello, Tyler.
You look well.

396
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,190
不过我打算改变一下
I aim to change that.

397
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,799
为了报复我
Threatening a pregnant girl

398
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,634
你居然威胁一个孕妇
in order to exact
revenge against me.

399
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:32,002
我从没想过你会变得如此不堪
I never expected you
to sink so low.

400
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,438
不得不承认，我对你刮目相看
I admit, I'm impressed.

401
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:38,373
我以前也跟你混了不少日子
I used to hang out with you.

402
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,712
或多或少也学到了一点
I guess something
must have rubbed off.

403
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,353
如果卡洛琳知道你变成这样
What do you think
Caroline would say

404
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,148
不知道她会怎么想呢？
if she saw what you've become?

405
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,951
或许当我在电话里告诉她你的死讯时
Perhaps I'll ask her
when I call her

406
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,888
我会亲自问问她
to tell her of your demise.

407
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,728
无论我变成怎样
Whatever happens to me,

408
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,057
也不会消除卡洛琳对你的恨意
Caroline is never
gonna stop hating you.

409
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,928
来吧，兄弟，尽你所能
Come on, mate.
Give it a bit more effort.

410
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,401
我想好好享受这一刻
I wanna enjoy myself.

411
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,955
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

412
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,721
这是花园
This is the garden.

413
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,260
是我用来惩罚那些
违反我规矩的吸血鬼的地方
It's where I punish vampires
who break my rules.

414
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,198
但很久以前，这里本来不是这样的用途
But a long time ago,
used to be something else.

415
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,038
来，告诉我你看到了什么
Go on.
Tell me what you see.

416
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,381
两层楼、希腊圆柱
Two stories,
Greek columns,

417
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,982
环烧式门廊、挑高天花板
wrap-around porch,
high ceilings,

418
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,584
还有气窗
transom windows.

419
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,051
很漂亮的房子，那又怎样？
It's lovely.
So what?

420
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,951
是我为你设计的，原本是我们的房子
So, I designed it for you.
It was gonna be ours.

421
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,656
那个
That....

422
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:08,035
这里本该是我们俩的幸福结局吗？
This was supposed to be
our happily ever after?

423
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,833
是的，属于你和我
Yours and mine.

424
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,410
只是你跟克劳斯离开了这里
Except you flew the coop
with Klaus.

425
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,772
当时这里已经打好了地基
I already built
the foundation for the place.

426
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,937
在你走后，我中止了工程
I halted construction after you took off.

427
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,009
本想等你回来后继续的
Plan was to wait for you to return.

428
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:20,678
但你再也没回来
You never did.

429
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,015
所以现在这里被用来埋葬背叛我的人
So, now it's where I bury
the people who betray me.

430
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,588
你可以去找我啊
You could've come after me.

431
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:28,055
你和克劳斯在一起，我不知道你在哪
You were with Klaus.
I didn't know where.

432
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,217
我不知道你是否还想和我在一起
I didn't know if you
still wanted to be with me.

433
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:31,692
你只要回家就会找到我
All you had to do was come home.

434
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,160
事情没那么简单
It was more complicated than that.

435
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:34,355
我们离开不久
Not long after we left here,

436
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,522
他就给我插了匕首
he put a dagger in my heart

437
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,292
然后把我锁在棺材里90年
and stuck me in a box
for 90 years.

438
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,664
他整整偷走了我一个世纪的时间
He stole a century from me
like it were nothing.

439
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,362
这就是他的为人，蕾贝卡
That's what he does, Rebekah.

440
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,734
克劳斯永远不会满足
Klaus will never be happy.

441
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,933
他得不到的东西永远也不会
He'll be damned
if he lets anyone get something

442
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:46,441
- 让别人得到
- 我知道
-that he can't have.
-I know.

443
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:49,205
我已经按照他的指示活了一千年
I've been dancing to this song
for a thousand years.

444
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,372
从现在起，你有个选择
Starting right now,
you have a choice...

445
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,444
一个是随心所欲，任意夺走
...between the brother who
takes away your happiness

446
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,849
你幸福的哥哥
另一个是
whenever he feels like it
and the man who wants

447
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,990
想满足你任何需求的男人
to give you everything
you ever wanted.

448
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,024
为了泄恨
他会当着我的面杀掉你
He will kill you in front of my eyes
out of spite.

449
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,932
如果我们先摆脱他就不会了
Not if we get rid of him first.

450
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,706
克劳斯一定已经知道了
Klaus must have known.

451
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,506
这是唯一的解释
That's the only explanation.

452
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,408
他对宝宝不闻不问
He could care less
about the baby.

453
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,912
只是想要她出生
He just wants her to be born

454
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,277
这样他就能利用她制造更多混合种
so he can use her
to make more sired Hybrids.

455
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:32,717
虽然杜恩的表现
Although the way
that Dwayne was acting,

456
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:35,519
更像是被我转变的
it was more like
he was sired to me.

457
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,089
我应该带你回家
I should take you home.

458
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,661
你是认真的吗？哪里还有家？
Are you serious?
Home to what?

459
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,167
听着，不管我弟弟的意图如何
我还是保持本意
Look. Regardless of my brother's
intentions, mine remain the same.

460
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,531
我说过会保护你
I said that I would protect you,

461
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,035
就算是克劳斯想伤害你也不行
even, if need be,
from Klaus himself.

462
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,477
我可以照顾自己
I can take care of myself.

463
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,271
一直以来都是这样的
I've done it for a long time.

464
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,478
这就是你的复仇计划吗，泰勒？
Is this your idea of revenge, Tyler?

465
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,716
累人的捉迷藏游戏？
Grueling game of hide-and-seek?

466
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,255
啊！
Aah!

467
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,667
让我们结束这一切吧，怎么样？
Let's end this, shall we?

468
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,978
胆子不小啊你
How dare you?

469
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,553
这才是开始
I'm just getting started.

470
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,483
你变得残忍了
You've grown bloodthirsty.

471
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,356
也许你该庆幸你母亲没有活着
Perhaps it's best
your mother didn't live

472
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,894
看到你这个样子
to see you like this.

473
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,304
真是难过
It's sad, really.

474
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,367
我以为自己把你塑造得很好
I thought I made you better.

475
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,676
结果你这么的令人失望
Turns out,
you're quite the disappointment.

476
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,246
我想我是你另一个失败的例子
I guess I'm another one
of your failures.

477
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,048
就像你没有成功制造出混合种
Like how you failed
at making Hybrids,

478
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,350
搞得家族四分五裂
how you failed your family.

479
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,394
现在看来你又要失去自己的孩子了
Now it looks like
you're even gonna fail your own kid.

480
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:23,757
然后就这样结束你无趣的小命吧
And thus ends
your tedious little life.

481
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,794
至少不会耗时太久
At least it was brief.

482
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,340
做啊
Do it.

483
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,771
你永远不可能撕碎我
You're never gonna break me.

484
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,171
唯一能做的就是杀了我
Only thing you could do is kill me.

485
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,909
来吧，继续啊，快点结束一切
So go on. Go on.
Get it over with!

486
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,749
你想让我结束你的痛苦，是吗？
You want me to end your suffering,
don't you, hmm?

487
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,722
我确实是让你支离破碎
夺走了你的一切
I did break you,
took everything from you,

488
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,264
现在你又乞求我清理干净
and now you're begging me
to sweep away the shards

489
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,527
你那破碎卑微的生命
of your shattered, little life.

490
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:11,473
让你死就太便宜你了
Death offers more peace
than you deserve.

491
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,848
让你活着岂不是更好
It's better to let you live,

492
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,213
每天早上你一醒来就会意识到
and each morning,
you will wake knowing

493
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,878
自己能继续悲惨地活着
that your wretched
existence continues

494
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,854
是因为我的意愿
only by my will.

495
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,796
现在滚，并且在你剩下的日子里
Now go and live
the rest of your days

496
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:31,368
记住你对我来说一文不值
knowing you are nothing to me.

497
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,835
你知道有多少傻子
Do you know how many
fools have tried

498
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,104
尝试击败我哥哥吗？
to vanquish my brother?

499
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,339
如果你反抗他，他就杀掉你
If you stand against him,
he will kill you,

500
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:46,313
那种可怕又血腥的场面
and it will be awful and bloody,

501
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,475
我可不想在一旁欣赏
and I will not stand around
and watch.

502
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,648
你忘了我有秘密武器
You forget I have a secret weapon.

503
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,849
黛维娜，几世纪以来最厉害的女巫
Davina, the most powerful witch
in the last couple centuries.

504
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:57,656
如果她能找到杀掉他的方法呢
What if she can find a way to kill him?

505
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,194
你还是不明白，对吧？
You don't know, do you?

506
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,261
你杀了克劳斯的话
You can't kill Klaus,

507
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,300
自己也会跟着死
not without dying yourself.

508
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,403
我哥哥柯尔和芬恩的死教给我们
We learned it from the deaths
of my brothers Kol and Finn.

509
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,405
如果一个真祖死掉，那他们这条
If an Original dies,

510
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,703
血脉的吸血鬼都会跟着死去
every vampire ever made from their line
dies with him.

511
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,113
即使你杀掉克劳斯，他还是赢家
Even if you kill Klaus,
he'll still win.

512
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,977
一千年来都是这样
It's been that way
for a thousand years.

513
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,015
这就是他的手段，他永远都是赢家
That's his trick.
He always wins.

514
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:23,344
还有一个方法
There's another way.

515
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,681
什么方法？
What would that be?

516
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,223
- 我们把他永远埋葬于此
- 你疯了吗？
-We bury him down here forever.
-Are you mad?

517
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:29,792
你这惊骇小密室也许能关得住
This little chamber
of horrors may work

518
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,223
你那帮乌合之众
但你真的认为
for your riffraff,
but do you really think

519
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:32,385
这能关住我哥哥吗？
it will hold my brother?

520
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,498
难道不值得冒这个险吗？
Isn't it worth the risk?

521
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,327
你知道我是对的
You know I'm right.

522
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,866
克劳斯永远不会停止控制你
Klaus will never stop trying
to control you.

523
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,966
难道我就该相信
And I'm supposed to believe that...

524
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,006
在一个世纪后，你突然心甘情愿
after a century, suddenly you're willing 

525
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,268
冒着死在他手上的危险
也要和我在一起吗？
to risk death
at his hands to be with me?

526
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,441
我想捍卫我的家园
I want to defend my home.

527
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:49,974
我想要自由
I want to be free,

528
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:52,309
如果这也意味着我能和你在一起
and if that means
I get to be with you,

529
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,417
就更有理由要把他埋在这了
all the more reason to bury him.

530
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:58,211
现在告诉我，你想要什么？
Now you tell me,
what do you want?

531
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,317
你们总算来了
There you are.

532
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,895
看来你找到我们迷途的羔羊了
I see you found our wandering stray.

533
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,496
也许她能给我
Perhaps she could

534
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:10,190
解释一下情况
shed some light on the situation.

535
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:12,696
这个
This...

536
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,700
显然是具混合种尸体
...would appear to be
the body of a Hybrid.

537
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,206
他叫杜恩
His name was Dwayne.

538
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,276
不管他是谁，不是我转变的
Well, whoever he was,
I didn't sire him.

539
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,945
知道这是怎么一回事吗？
Any idea how that's possible?

540
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,672
说得好像你真不知道一样
As if you didn't know.

541
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,186
你们俩倒成了好朋友了
Aren't you two fast friends?

542
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,183
快说吧
Well, come on, then.

543
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,486
你们共谋了什么可怕的罪名
What horrible accusation
have you conspired

544
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,322
要安在我头上？
to levy against me?

545
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,090
泰勒洛克伍带海莉来
是为了验证一个雅测
Tyler Lockwood brought Hayley
here to test a theory.

546
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:46,032
她孩子的血液能创造混合种
That the blood of her child
could be used to sire Hybrids.

547
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:48,536
他声称你早就知道这事
He claims you knew that.

548
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,609
更有甚者，你打算利用这点建立军队
Furthermore, you intended to use
this knowledge to build an army.

549
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,979
显然你也认为这是真的
And, of course,
you assume it's true.

550
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,614
不然我怎么会
I mean, why else would I show

551
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,775
对自己的亲生骨肉有任何的兴趣？
any interest in my
own flesh and blood?

552
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,679
一个悲痛欲绝的爱哭小鬼
A heartbroken, little crybaby
points his finger at me,

553
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:09,460
公然指控我，而我的亲哥哥
却深信不疑，巴不得全盘接受
and my own brother falls in line,
eager to believe it.

554
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,259
你总能快速得出最坏的预测
How quickly you assume the worst...

555
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,596
尤其是当这出自她口中时
Especially when it comes from her.

556
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,495
少装出一副愤慨的样子
ELlJAH:
Spare me your indignation.

557
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,569
你什么时候对海莉和她的孩子
When have you ever demonstrated
any kind of concern

558
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,136
展露过任何关心
towards Hayley or her child

559
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,570
除非是为了你的一己之私
beyond your own selfish pursuits?

560
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,672
你曾经还对我说过什么？
And what was it
you once said to me?

561
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,902
“每个国王都要有继承者”
"Every king needs an heir."

562
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,380
我的好哥哥
My big brother...

563
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,273
所以说你怀疑我的意图
So, you doubt my intentions.

564
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,579
倒不能说是意料之外
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

565
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:39,923
与高尚的以利亚相比
Standing beside the noble Elijah,

566
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,525
无论如何我都是不成器的弟弟
how can I be anything
but the lesser brother?

567
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:46,522
一个骗子、一个操纵者
A liar, a manipulator...

568
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,594
一个杂种？
A bastard?

569
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,071
对你来说，我不过如此，对吧？
That's all I am to you, isn't it?

570
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,202
蕾贝卡亦然
And to Rebekah.

571
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:02,168
而且由海莉对你言听计从的样子看来
And judging by the way Hayley
hangs on your every word,

572
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,315
显然她也是这么想的
it's clear she feels the same way.

573
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,245
毫无疑问我的孩子有朝一日也会如此
No doubt, my child will,
as well.

574
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,146
弟弟，如果我…
Brother, if l--

575
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:15,918
该说的我们都已经说完了
哥哥
We have said
all that needs to be said, brother.

576
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,632
我会好好扮演被赋予的角色
I'll play the role I've been given.

577
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,137
你们俩好好相依作伴吧
You two enjoy each other's company.

578
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,148
幻觉和痴呆的症状一旦发作
You'll have much to bond over,

579
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:42,309
你们就更相依为命了
once the hallucinations
and dementia set in.

580
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,847
这一口就当作是
Consider that bite

581
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,219
我送给你们的离别礼物吧
my parting gift to you both.

582
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:09,844
结束了
That's it.

583
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:12,674
你自由了
You're free.

584
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,657
你说得没错，我能感觉到
You're right.
I can feel it.

585
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,423
之前我总是想着
Before, I was always thinking about

586
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,223
克劳斯会想要我做什么
what Klaus would want me to do.

587
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,425
现在我想的是“去他的
Now I'm, like,
"Screw that guy."

588
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,063
克劳斯米卡森吃屎去吧
Klaus Mikaelson can suck it.

589
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,742
怎么了？怎么这副表情？
What?
What's that look for?

590
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,313
马赛尔要我让你忘了我
Marcel wants me to make you
forget about me.

591
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,419
哦，你不需要这么做
Oh, well,
you don't have to do that.

592
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:58,794
我的命是你救的
I, like, owe you my life.

593
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:02,891
我会替你保密的
I'll keep your secret.

594
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:09,004
再说，能再次和正常人
Besides, it's kind of nice

595
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,471
聊聊天还蛮不错的
just talking to someone normal again.

596
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,241
你觉得我正常吗？
You think I'm normal?

597
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,913
我是个像怪胎一样隐居在教堂阁楼的
I'm a 16-year-old witch
living in a church attic

598
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,673
16岁女巫
Iike some kind of freak.

599
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,950
我是个喜欢混夜店的男同志
I'm a gay club kid who died

600
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,917
死过一次又复活成吸血鬼
and came back as a vampire.

601
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:26,456
是啊
Yeah.

602
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,583
正常是相对而言的，对吧？
Normal is kind of relative,
you know?

603
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:33,094
来，我们打勾勾发誓
Here.
Pinky swear on it.

604
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,735
你不必帮我
You don't have to help.

605
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,569
我能自己翻找这堆狼人古董
I can dig through
the werewolf antique show on my own.

606
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,376
还有，你不用涂点药膏
Besides, shouldn't
you put some kind

607
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,607
或什么的在伤口上吗？
of ointment or
something on that?

608
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,017
那咬伤杀不了我
The bite won't kill me.

609
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:57,911
这咬伤就像尼克劳斯一样
Like Niklaus himself,
it's more of a nuisance

610
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,249
顶多算是个无法赶走的麻烦
than anything, really.

611
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,050
好吧，反正我也需要
Good, because I'm eventually

612
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,783
有人送我回家
gonna need a ride home.

613
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,198
另外，感谢你在这里守着
And thanks, by the way,
for staying out here.

614
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:10,962
你不必那样做的
You didn't have to.

615
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:12,625
我知道
I know.

616
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,364
但你说这个村子的人
But you said the people
of this village

617
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,601
是你所有的家人了
are all of the family
you have left.

618
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,144
我能感同身受
I can relate.

619
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,141
你在想克劳斯
You're thinking about Klaus.

620
00:36:30,888 --> 00:36:33,254
也许是我太想给他扣上罪名了
Perhaps I was too willing
to condemn him.

621
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,759
在我们一起的这一千年里
In the 1,000 years
that we have been together,

622
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:39,920
我弟弟犯下了许多令人发指的罪行
my brother has committed
numerous unspeakable acts,

623
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:42,088
但蕾贝卡也是
but, then again, so has Rebekah.

624
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,355
还有我也是
So have l.

625
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,627
我上次在卡布的时候也是
So did I the last time I was in Cabo.

626
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,131
我们都做过坏事
We all do bad things.

627
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:49,637
只是大多数人
It's just, most people die

628
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:51,536
都在罪行过多之前就死了
before the list gets embarrassing.

629
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,270
但你绝不要拿自己和克劳斯比
But don't for a second
compare yourself to Klaus.

630
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,956
这里就像个蒸笼一样
It's like a freaking hotbox in here.

631
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,529
我要出去透透气
I'm gonna get some air.

632
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,649
有人把这个留在这里了
Someone left this here.

633
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,044
这是什么？
What is it?

634
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,157
一本印有
A Bible... with a family tree

635
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,259
家族族谱的圣经
that goes back generations.

636
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,221
这些人是谁？
What are these names?

637
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,228
安德莉亚是谁？
Who is Andrea?

638
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,903
我想是我
I think I am.

639
00:37:58,843 --> 00:38:00,708
那是我出生的日子
That's the day that I was born.

640
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,983
我以为你离开了
I thought you were leaving us.

641
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,688
我们都清楚这个家
We both know this family

642
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,352
不能没有我
can barely function without me.

643
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,555
以利亚和海莉在哪？
Where are Elijah and Hayley?

644
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,159
我把他们留在河口了
I left them in the bayou.

645
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,901
为什么？
Why?

646
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,165
我和以利亚起了点小争执
Elijah and I had a bit of a row.

647
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:35,478
海莉怂恿他与我作对
Hayley has conspired
to turn him against me.

648
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:38,047
你也知道我们哥哥从来就
And you know our brother
never was one

649
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,046
过不了美人关
to resist a pretty face.

650
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:43,943
种种阴错阳差下，我咬了他
So one thing led to another,
and I bit him.

651
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,582
把他们两个都留在那里了
Left them both
stranded in the swamp.

652
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,124
插匕首、咬伤、抛弃
Daggering, biting, deserting.

653
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:51,693
你的这些恶行都没有尽头吗？
Does your wickedness ever end?

654
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:54,888
我的这些恶行都是为了自保
My wickedness
is self-preservation,

655
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,789
如果不是因为在各方面
and I wouldn't have
to go to such lengths

656
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,332
我都被陷于不义
were I not beset on all sides

657
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,732
我也不会做那些事
by incompetence and treachery.

658
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,335
既然以利亚抛弃了我
Now that Elijah
has abandoned me,

659
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,070
我需要你帮助我对抗马赛尔
I'll be needing you
in my plot against Marcel.

660
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,048
别太着急想着离开这里
Don't expect to be
leaving town any time soon.

661
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,652
你这么对以利亚，我为什么要帮你？
Why should I help you
after what you did to Elijah?

662
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,591
你是我的家人
You're my family.

663
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,794
况且，谁能比他深爱的女孩
Besides,
who better to spy on Marcel

664
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,563
更适合监视他呢？
than the girl he so clearly loves?

665
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,602
你可以告诉我他所有的秘密
You can tell me all his secrets.

666
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:42,304
比如他是如何找到我们住处的
Like how did he find us here?

667
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,110
你有什么想法吗，妹妹？
Any idea about that, little sister?

668
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,846
我怎么会知道马赛尔
为什么会做这些事？
How should I know
why Marcel does what he does?

669
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:58,053
你以为我不知道你在法语区那些
You think I don't know
about your engineered run-ins

670
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,856
设计好的小把戏吗？
all over the Quarter?

671
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,965
我知道你私下跟他聊过
I know you've had private chats with him.

672
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:08,064
快告诉我他都跟你说了什么秘密
So, just tell me what secrets
he's confided to you.

673
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:12,339
他是不是想暗算我？
Is he plotting against me?

674
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,777
我可怜的哥哥，太多疑了
My poor brother, so paranoid.

675
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,383
马赛尔什么都不知道
Marcel knows nothing.

676
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,888
他没有想暗算你
He is not plotting against you.

677
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,390
他只是简单地认为跟你吵了一架
He simply thinks
you're in a quarrel,

678
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,153
想跟你和好
in need of making up.

679
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,700
也许我们会的
Perhaps we will.

680
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,839
毕竟你知道我一向很善于
After all, you know
I'm capable of forgiving those

681
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:48,638
原谅那些让我失望的人
只要他们认识到错误
who disappoint me
soon as they've seen

682
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:53,079
并且为此付出代价就可以
the error of their ways
and suffered for them.

683
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:56,620
你要好好记住啊
You'd do well to remember that.

684
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,550
你从没让我忘记过
You never let me forget.

685
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,768
你想跟我做交易
You want to make
a deal with me,

686
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,304
你必须有所付出才行
you got to offer me something.

687
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,272
我已经知道那个叫海莉的狼女了
I already know about
Hayley the werewolf girl.

688
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,675
你还知道什么吗？
What else you got?

689
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,906
如果我告诉你那个狼女
What if I told you
that werewolf girl

690
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,743
正怀着克劳斯的孩子呢？
is carrying Klaus' child?

691
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,088
而且如果那个孩子出生
And if that baby is born...

692
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,420
就意味着吸血鬼种族的终结？
...it'll mean the end
of the vampire species?

693
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,800
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
