1
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,446
We can't be accused of wasting money?

2
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:54,366
- Absolutely.
- We are taking the smallest possible delegation?

3
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:58,924
- Absolutely. Pared to the bone.
- Who are all those people?

4
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:04,927
- Our delegation.
- You said it'd been pared to the bone.

5
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:07,651
- So it has?
- Who are they?

6
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:12,125
A small delegation from
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

7
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:16,285
- But this is a DAA mission.
- Yes, well, we are going abroad.

8
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,444
Foreign policy is at stake.

9
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:23,606
We're going to ratify a contract for one of the
biggest export orders Britain's ever obtained.

10
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:30,042
That was negotiated by British Electronic
Systems. Who are all these civil servants?

11
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:34,206
There's a delegation from the Department
of Trade and one from Industry.

12
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:38,002
There's a group from Energy.
We are going to an oil sheikdom.

13
00:01:38,174 --> 00:01:41,642
There's a Deputy Secretary leading a team
from the Cabinet Office.

14
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:47,013
There's a group from the Central Office
of Information, there's our DAA team.

15
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,881
Press secretaries, private secretaries,
liaison secretaries.

16
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:55,044
The legal department who did the contract,
those who supervised it.

17
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,283
- Pared to the bone?
- To the bone.

18
00:01:57,453 --> 00:02:01,445
If we'd met in Middlesbrough,
we'd have only taken seven people.

19
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:06,640
Well, Teesside is perhaps not quite
so diplomatically significant as Kumran.

20
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:11,249
- Teesside returns four MPs.
- Kumran controls Shell and BP.

21
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,764
- What are you doing here?
- Purely my sense of duty-free.

22
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,330
Duty-free?

23
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:23,849
Er... duty, free from any personal consideration.

24
00:02:24,012 --> 00:02:26,570
- Look through this.
- What is it?

25
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:29,166
- It's the final communiqué.
- The final...?!

26
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,722
You can't write it before the meeting!

27
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,679
On the contrary, you can't write it
AFTER the meeting.

28
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:41,050
We had to get agreement from other departments,
the EEC, Washington, the Kumrani Embassy.

29
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:46,205
- You can't do that in the desert.
- It may bear no relation to what we say.

30
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,726
No communiqué ever bears any relation
to what you say.

31
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,885
- Then why have one?
- It gets you past the press corps.

32
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:58,443
The journalists need to justify
their huge expenses for a futile non-event.

33
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,445
- Non-event?
- Oh, a brilliant triumph for you, Minister.

34
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,888
Which is why it's a futile non-event for the press.

35
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,329
They'd like me to get drunk at the reception.

36
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:12,963
Yes. Not much hope of that. Kumran is dry.

37
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:16,918
Yeah. Well, of course,
it is in the middle of the desert.

38
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,963
- You mean... Islamic law?
- Alas, yes.

39
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:27,963
- We can get a drink at the British Embassy?
- Yes.

40
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:33,490
But the reception and the dinner are
at the palace. Five hours of orange juice.

41
00:03:34,492 --> 00:03:37,211
Five hours? Without a single drinky?

42
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:43,726
Why did you let me come on this trip?
What are we going to do? Hip flasks?

43
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:47,329
No, much too risky. We have to grin and bear it.

44
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:53,166
Why don't we set up a security communications
room next door to the reception?

45
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:57,119
You know, emergency telephones,
telex lines to Downing Street.

46
00:03:57,291 --> 00:04:01,285
Then we could fill it with booze
brought in from the Embassy.

47
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:03,887
- Minister!
- Liven up the orange juice!

48
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,731
That is a... stroke of genius!

49
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:13,762
- Could it be done?
- Such a room would need a major crisis.

50
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:18,324
- Five hours on orange juice is a major crisis.
- The pound is under pressure.

51
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:24,489
- Could you arrange it?
- I think I can guarantee enthusiastic support.

52
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:48,487
Most awfully generous of you to present me
with this very splendid gift. Oops!

53
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:53,603
- It is a great pleasure to commemorate this day.
- It's so beautiful!

54
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:58,526
A magnificent example
of 17th-century Islamic art.

55
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:01,651
- What was it originally?
- A rosewater jar.

56
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:07,012
- I see. For... er... rosewater, presumably?
- Quite so.

57
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:12,167
Minister, there's an urgent call for you
in the communications room. A Mr Haig.

58
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:19,365
General Haig?

59
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,446
No, MR Haig. You know, with the dimples.

60
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:26,762
Yes, yes. Do excuse me. Most important.

61
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:37,680
- I believe there's a message from Mr Haig.
- Yes, Minister.

62
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,893
- I'm the only woman here.
- Special dispensation.

63
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:54,250
They've made you
an honorary man for the evening.

64
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:58,612
- This will look wonderful on our hall table.
- Mrs Hacker, I'm not sure if...

65
00:05:58,771 --> 00:06:01,732
- If what?
- It's a gift to the minister.

66
00:06:01,893 --> 00:06:03,483
It's his hall, too.

67
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:07,362
- I don't think you'll be allowed to keep it.
- Why ever not?

68
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,732
It could be thought, if it were valuable,
it could influence some ministers.

69
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:16,444
Not your minister, that is, my minister,
our minister. Your husband, as it were.

70
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:21,401
As it is, in fact. I mean, he is. I mean...
Well, some ministers...

71
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,961
- Bernard.
- Sorry.

72
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:28,125
- Are you saying we have to give it back?
- No, that'd be an insult.

73
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:32,365
- We can't give it back. What do I do?
- It becomes government property.

74
00:06:32,533 --> 00:06:36,365
- It's put in a basement in Whitehall.
- You sure we can't keep it?

75
00:06:36,533 --> 00:06:40,129
- Not if it's worth more than £50.
- How do we find out?

76
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:43,286
- You get a valuation.
- Could you get a valuation?

77
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:49,129
Wouldn't it be wonderful if it was less
than £50? Because it's awfully pretty.

78
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:51,531
Well, I...

79
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:56,209
- I suppose I could try.
- Oh, Bernard, you are wonderful!

80
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,364
What would we do without you?

81
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:03,521
Bernard. Wanted in the communications room.

82
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,682
A Mr John Walker.

83
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:13,004
- Johnnie Walker?
- Yes, from the Scotch Office... Sorry.

84
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,930
- Scottish Office.
- Isn't there a message for me?

85
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:23,292
Yes, of course. Bernard will get it for you
if you give him your glass. If you...

86
00:07:23,453 --> 00:07:27,605
...give him your glass,
he'll get you some more orange juice.

87
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,968
- Is Humphrey here yet?
- Yes, he's just over here.

88
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:32,725
Excuse me.

89
00:07:32,893 --> 00:07:34,531
Ahem. Excuse me.

90
00:07:37,413 --> 00:07:41,167
- Minister.
- What on earth...?!

91
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,768
Traditional Foreign Office courtesy
to our Arab hosts, isn't that right?

92
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,923
Spot on, Humphrey.
Isn't that right, Your Royal Highness?

93
00:07:50,093 --> 00:07:53,401
Yes, we regard it
as a warm and gracious compliment.

94
00:07:53,572 --> 00:07:56,768
May I present our minister?
This is Prince Mohammed.

95
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:00,129
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you, Your Excellency.

96
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:06,290
Excellency! I say, if you'll excuse me, I just
must have a quick word with Sir Humphrey.

97
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:10,490
I can't believe my eyes!
What are you here as? Ali Baba?

98
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:15,240
- Minister, when in Rome...
- We are not in Rome. You look ridiculous!

99
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:19,804
I suppose if we were in the Fiji Islands,
you'd wear a grass skirt!

100
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:25,923
The Foreign Office view, as Arabs are sensitive,
is we should show them whose side we're on.

101
00:08:26,093 --> 00:08:31,687
It may come as a surprise to the Foreign Office,
but you're supposed to be on OUR side!

102
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:36,165
- Bernard, any messages?
- Well, there is one for Sir Humphrey.

103
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:40,165
- Oh, good.
- The Soviet Embassy on the line. Mr Smirnoff.

104
00:08:45,371 --> 00:08:47,250
Sorry. So sorry.

105
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:50,205
Isn't there one for me?

106
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:55,366
There was a message from the Embassy,
the school - a delegation of Teachers.

107
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:58,728
Ah, I must go and greet the Teachers...

108
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:03,042
...before the Bells goes... bell goes!

109
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:08,683
You're receiving a great many
very urgent messages.

110
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:11,447
- Yes, yes, we are, aren't we?
- Excuse me.

111
00:09:11,612 --> 00:09:15,206
Your Royal Highness,
could I present Mr Pennington?

112
00:09:15,371 --> 00:09:18,571
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course, Your Highness.

113
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:25,884
Excuse me, but I could not help overhearing
your conversation about valuing the gift.

114
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,246
- Perhaps I can help.
- That would be...

115
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,210
- Do you have any idea how much?
- Of course.

116
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:34,920
An original 17th-century rosewater jar
is very valuable.

117
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,844
- Oh, dear.
- You are not pleased?

118
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:42,371
Yes and no. If it's valuable,
the minister won't be allowed to keep it.

119
00:09:42,531 --> 00:09:45,728
- I was rather hoping it wasn't.
- Ah.

120
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:50,728
Well, as I was saying, an original
17th-century rosewater jar is very valuable,

121
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:55,089
but this copy, though excellently done,
is not of the same order.

122
00:09:55,254 --> 00:09:58,402
Oh, good. About how much?

123
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:03,206
- I would be interested to hear your guess.
- Oh.

124
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:06,728
Er... well, a little under... £50?

125
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:10,442
Brilliant! Quite a connoisseur!

126
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,206
- And you would sign a valuation certificate?
- But of course.

127
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,960
- Your English customs are very strange.
- Oh, why?

128
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,442
You are so strict about a gift,

129
00:10:21,612 --> 00:10:25,607
yet your electronics company pays
our finance minister a million dollars

130
00:10:25,773 --> 00:10:27,764
to secure this contract.

131
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:29,924
Is this not strange?

132
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:34,683
- You... You don't mean...
- Of course.

133
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:37,924
I work for the minister. I got my share.

134
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:41,723
- What for?
- For keeping my mouth shut.

135
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:46,130
L-I see. Would you excuse me for a moment?

136
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:51,205
Minister, can I have a private word
with Sir Humphrey?

137
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:53,966
You may speak freely, Bernie.

138
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,920
Yes... Oh, there was a message for you
in the communications room.

139
00:10:58,094 --> 00:11:01,688
- The VAT man, your 69 returns.
- What?!

140
00:11:01,853 --> 00:11:04,687
- VAT 69.
- Oh. Ah!

141
00:11:04,853 --> 00:11:06,648
Yes... thanks.

142
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:13,759
I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion

143
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:18,880
that the minister has had almost
as many urgent messages as he can take.

144
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:22,648
- I've found out the most terrible thing.
- Dear me.

145
00:11:22,813 --> 00:11:25,121
This contract was obtained by bribery.

146
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:27,009
Of course.

147
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:31,759
All contracts in Kumran are obtained by bribery.
Everybody knows that.

148
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,607
It's all right, as long as nobody knows.

149
00:11:35,451 --> 00:11:37,648
- Shouldn't we tell the minister?
- Certainly not.

150
00:11:37,813 --> 00:11:41,201
- But if everybody knows.
- Everybody else.

151
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,728
We do not let a minister know
what everybody else knows.

152
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:47,487
Highness, how very nice to see you.

153
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:51,442
Ah, Lawrence of Arabia,
you're wanted in the communications room.

154
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,603
Oh, good. Er, who is it?

155
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:55,571
Napoleon!

156
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:07,763
"It is alleged in Le Monde that
the recent British contract with Kumran

157
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:09,924
"was won by bribery."

158
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:13,406
- Do you hear this, Humphrey?
- Yes, indeed.

159
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:18,362
"It's part of a hideous web of corruption
woven by Western industrial countries

160
00:12:18,531 --> 00:12:22,969
"and Third World governments that forms
a blot of our modern civilisation."

161
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,853
- Webs don't form blots, Minister.
- What?

162
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:29,732
Well, spiders don't have any ink, you see.

163
00:12:30,973 --> 00:12:32,768
Only cuttlefish.

164
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:36,482
- Spiders don't...! What are you talking about?
- I know...

165
00:12:36,652 --> 00:12:40,850
- Thank you, Bernard.
- Isn't this terrible? Baseless accusations!

166
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:43,206
Oh, yes, yes, terrible.

167
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:46,523
Backsheesh, palm-greasing!
Good God, we're British!

168
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:49,286
Absolutely, Minister!

169
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:55,286
It's not like the FT to print a story like this
unless there's something behind it.

170
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,447
- Is there something behind it, Humphrey?
- I think the sports news is behind it.

171
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:06,531
- I want to know the truth, Humphrey.
- I don't think you do.

172
00:13:07,292 --> 00:13:11,491
- Will you answer a direct question?
- I strongly advise you not to ask one.

173
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:14,085
- Why?
- It might provoke a direct answer.

174
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:16,964
It never has yet.

175
00:13:18,813 --> 00:13:21,612
What do YOU know about this? Tell me!

176
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:26,370
Oh, well, I... er... Er, that is... there was.
Someone did.

177
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:30,411
- A lot of gossip, that's all. Rumour, hearsay.
- Bernard?

178
00:13:31,054 --> 00:13:35,250
- One Kumrani did tell me he'd received...
- Hearsay, Minister.

179
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:38,051
- Hearsay?
- Yes, Bernard heard him say it.

180
00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:43,366
Are you telling me that the contract
was won by bribery?

181
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,603
I do wish you wouldn't use words like bribery.

182
00:13:46,773 --> 00:13:51,005
What would you like me to say?
Slush funds, sweeteners, brown envelopes?

183
00:13:51,174 --> 00:13:54,768
These are extremely crude
and unworthy expressions

184
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,732
for what is no more than creative negotiation.

185
00:13:57,893 --> 00:13:59,612
It is general practice.

186
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:04,973
You do realise what you're saying?
I ratified that contract in good faith!

187
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:10,331
In that press communiqué, I announced
a British success won in a fair fight!

188
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,290
Mm, yes, I did wonder about that bit.

189
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,648
- Now you're telling me it was got by bribery.
- No.

190
00:14:16,813 --> 00:14:21,250
- Oh, it was not got by bribery?
- That is not what I said.

191
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:25,964
- What did you say?
- That I'm not telling you it was got by bribery.

192
00:14:26,134 --> 00:14:31,331
- How would you describe these payments?
- How does the contract describe them?

193
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:36,089
Oh, well, that's quite simple. Retainers,
personal donations, special discounts.

194
00:14:36,254 --> 00:14:41,884
Miscellaneous outgoings, agents' fees,
political contributions, management expenses.

195
00:14:42,054 --> 00:14:44,201
How are these payments made?

196
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:47,366
Anything from a numbered Swiss account

197
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:52,130
to a fistful of used oncers
slipped under the door of the gents'.

198
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:57,286
- Do you realise how shocking this is?
- That is a narrow and parochial view.

199
00:14:57,451 --> 00:15:00,411
In other parts of the world,
they see things differently.

200
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:03,563
- Sin is not a branch of geography.
- But it is.

201
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:08,330
In developing countries, the size
of the extra contractual payment

202
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,723
shows how serious you are.

203
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:13,487
It's like a publisher's advance to an author.

204
00:15:13,652 --> 00:15:17,442
Whoever pays the biggest advance
expects the biggest sales.

205
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:19,603
- I don't believe it!
- (BUZZER)

206
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:21,969
Is corruption government policy?

207
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:25,966
No, no, Minister!
It could never be government policy!

208
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:29,763
That is unthinkable! Only government practice.

209
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:35,402
That was the press office. The papers want
a statement about the bribery allegation.

210
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,371
What am I going to say?

211
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:43,245
The press office can devise something convincing
and meaningless. That's what they're paid for.

212
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:46,609
- You're a cynic, Humphrey.
- Cynic.

213
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:50,447
A cynic is what an idealist calls a realist.

214
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:57,130
I'll tell the truth. After all, I knew nothing of this.
Why should I back something I never approved?

215
00:15:57,292 --> 00:16:02,491
But this contract means thousands
of British jobs, millions of export dollars!

216
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:06,772
Surely you won't throw all that away
because of a technical irregularity?

217
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:14,246
- It's not a technical irregularity, it is corruption!
- No. Merely a few uncontracted pre-payments.

218
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:19,964
I don't expect you to understand, but government
is not just a question of fixing and manipulating.

219
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:24,924
- There is a moral dimension.
- Of, yes, of course, the moral dimension.

220
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:27,688
It is never out of my thoughts.

221
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:32,322
So if questions are asked in the press,
I shall announce an inquiry.

222
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,290
Splendid idea. I shall be happy to conduct it.

223
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:37,841
No, no, no, no, no.

224
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:41,848
No, not an internal inquiry, a REAL inquiry.

225
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:44,206
- You can't be serious!
- A real inquiry.

226
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,924
- I beg you...
- Humphrey... the moral dimension.

227
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,085
(DOORBELL)

228
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:56,451
- Good evening, Mrs Hacker.
- Bernard, come in.

229
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,411
- Thank you.
- Is that you, Bernard?

230
00:16:58,572 --> 00:17:00,563
- Yes, Minister.
- Shan't be a moment.

231
00:17:00,732 --> 00:17:06,125
- There's that jar from Kumran.
- A friend of mine was frightfully interested in it.

232
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,603
- Really?
- Jenny Goodwin from The Guardian.

233
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:13,571
- The Guardian?
- She asked where it came from.

234
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:17,326
- A journalist?
- Yes. Well, The Guardian, anyway.

235
00:17:19,732 --> 00:17:23,725
- She asked what it was worth. I said £50.
- You said £50.

236
00:17:23,893 --> 00:17:28,648
- Funnily enough, she thought it was genuine.
- She thought it was genuine?

237
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:33,089
- Bernard, you sound like an answering machine.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:17:33,254 --> 00:17:36,848
She wanted to ring Kumran's Embassy
to ask what it was worth.

239
00:17:37,013 --> 00:17:39,005
To ask what it was worth.

240
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:44,161
- So what did you say?
- I said, by all means.

241
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,402
It is only a copy, isn't it?

242
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:50,081
Well... so far as I'm...

243
00:17:50,973 --> 00:17:54,250
...so I'm lead to...
Good gracious, is that the time?

244
00:17:57,134 --> 00:18:00,442
- Bernard.
- Sorry, the minister will be a few minutes late.

245
00:18:03,853 --> 00:18:08,768
- I'll come back.
- Actually, I wonder if I could have a word.

246
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,250
Yes.

247
00:18:12,973 --> 00:18:15,884
- I said yes.
- Yes, I know.

248
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,523
You see...

249
00:18:19,692 --> 00:18:22,081
Something the matter, Bernard?

250
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,884
Come on, out with it.

251
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:28,804
Did you send the minister to the wrong dinner?

252
00:18:30,254 --> 00:18:35,692
Give him the wrong speech? Show him
some papers we didn't mean him to see?

253
00:18:38,612 --> 00:18:40,411
Worse?

254
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:43,804
Much worse?

255
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,081
Sit down.

256
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:53,612
Well... tell me about it.

257
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:57,241
You know that jar the minister
was given in Kumran?

258
00:18:57,411 --> 00:19:01,643
- Well, the minister's wife... liked it.
- I expect she did.

259
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:05,647
Then, when I explained the rules to her,
she looked... terribly sad.

260
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,648
They always do.

261
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:13,447
She said wouldn't it be marvellous
if it wasn't worth more than £50

262
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:16,045
and she sort of... looked at me.

263
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,969
But, my dear Bernard, a 17th-century vase!

264
00:19:20,134 --> 00:19:25,081
Yes, I know, but there was
this terribly nice Kumrani businessman

265
00:19:25,254 --> 00:19:30,089
and we had a... a... a... conversation

266
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:34,643
and he valued it as a copy,
not as an original - £49.95p.

267
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:42,165
- You believed him.
- He said he was an expert.

268
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:47,326
He spoke Arabic awfully well...
and so I accepted his valuation in good faith.

269
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,054
After all, Islam is a jolly good faith.

270
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:56,045
You took a grave personal risk.
You're lucky nobody's asked questions.

271
00:19:56,214 --> 00:20:00,683
A journalist saw it in the minister's house
and asked a lot of questions.

272
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:06,563
Mrs Hacker said it was a copy, but the press
are so... horribly suspicious about things.

273
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:11,009
- Despicable!
- So... what shall I do?

274
00:20:11,174 --> 00:20:13,165
The minister must be told.

275
00:20:15,652 --> 00:20:18,040
Sorry to keep you.

276
00:20:18,214 --> 00:20:22,411
- That's all right. Have you read my submission?
- I did, and it won't do.

277
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:25,609
I won't be accused of sweeping bribery
under the carpet.

278
00:20:25,773 --> 00:20:30,447
If questions are asked, I will announce
an independent inquiry chaired by a QC.

279
00:20:30,612 --> 00:20:34,286
You can't! That contract is worth £340 million!

280
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:38,049
Get thee behind me, Humphrey!
The moral dimension.

281
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:43,241
Minister, if there is an inquiry,
other things may come out, too.

282
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:45,005
Such as?

283
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:48,960
I'm afraid Bernard... has something to tell you.

284
00:20:53,174 --> 00:20:54,652
Well?

285
00:20:55,933 --> 00:21:00,165
- Well?
- You know that jar the Kumranis gave you?

286
00:21:00,331 --> 00:21:02,893
Yes, it's at the flat now. Most attractive.

287
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:07,045
I told Mrs Hacker she could keep it,
as it was valued for less than £50.

288
00:21:07,214 --> 00:21:11,683
The valuer was awfully nice
and I told him Mrs Hacker liked it a lot,

289
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,210
but he may have been just, well, being helpful.

290
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,643
It's all right, Bernard. No one will ever know.
Jolly enterprising of you.

291
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,692
Mrs Hacker told me
a journalist was asking questions.

292
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:28,281
- Journalist?!
- Can I just see that valuation?

293
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:37,165
Hmm. The Treasury isn't too happy about
valuations written on the backs of menus.

294
00:21:38,572 --> 00:21:41,134
It is a very good menu.

295
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:42,964
What is it worth?

296
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:47,523
- If it's a copy, what the valuation says.
- And if it's... genuine?

297
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:49,366
About £5,000.

298
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:52,206
Oh, my God, I kept it!

299
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:55,683
Bill from the press office wants to talk to you.

300
00:21:55,853 --> 00:21:59,447
I'm trying to deal with this problem
you've landed me with!

301
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:02,924
- That's what he wants to talk to you about.
- Well?

302
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:06,290
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office
is in a state.

303
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:10,447
Mrs Hacker has told The Guardian
that valuable 17th-century thing

304
00:22:10,612 --> 00:22:13,331
presented to you by Kumran was a copy.

305
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:17,281
The Guardian phoned the Kumrani Embassy
for their comments.

306
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:21,366
The Kumran government are incensed
at the suggestion they insulted Britain

307
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:23,808
by giving you a worthless gift.

308
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:29,170
It's building up into the biggest diplomatic
incident since "Death of a Princess".

309
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:34,121
There's a reporter from The Guardian
demanding to see you right away.

310
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,283
Ahem.

311
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,969
Yes, Bernard?

312
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:47,331
- Minister... what are you...
- Bernard, my duty is clear.

313
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,484
- I have no choice.
- No choice?

314
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:55,808
No choice. I didn't ask you to lie to my wife
about the value of that gift.

315
00:22:55,973 --> 00:23:00,170
- No, but...
- I realise you acted from the purest motives.

316
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:03,723
But there can be no excuse
for falsifying a document.

317
00:23:03,893 --> 00:23:05,723
- But I...
- Let me continue.

318
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:08,487
I cannot have it said that I asked you to do this.

319
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:16,049
No more can I have it said that I connived
at bribery and corruption. Enough is enough.

320
00:23:16,214 --> 00:23:21,049
If this journalist asks me straight questions
on either of these subjects...

321
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:24,366
...I shall have to give her straight answers.

322
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:27,442
The moral dimension.

323
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:34,210
Minister, I agree with you. I see now that
there is a moral dimension to everything.

324
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:41,844
Will you tell the press about
the communications room or shall I?

325
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:45,652
What?!

326
00:23:48,773 --> 00:23:52,130
You know, all the Scotch in Kumran.

327
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:57,045
You mean to tell me that... if I say...

328
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,201
...then you will... tell...

329
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:04,482
...and drop me in the...

330
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:09,005
In the moral dimension.

331
00:24:10,813 --> 00:24:13,929
- This is different! It's not the same thing!
- Why?

332
00:24:14,094 --> 00:24:17,165
- Drinking, it's not corruption.
- No, it's just deceit.

333
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:20,326
- Deceit?
- We have deceived the Kumranis.

334
00:24:20,491 --> 00:24:22,482


335
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:30,129
Tormented by the knowledge that we violated
their sacred Islamic law in their own country.

336
00:24:31,531 --> 00:24:36,286
Sooner or later, we'll have to own up
and admit that it was all your idea.

337
00:24:36,451 --> 00:24:39,013
- It wasn't!
- (BOTH) It was!

338
00:24:40,254 --> 00:24:42,447
It wasn't... was it?

339
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:45,728
Is it 50 lashes or 100?

340
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,051
I must ask you to meet this journalist.

341
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:58,402
- Oh, yes, all right. What am I going to say?
- I suggest attack is the best form of defence.

342
00:24:58,572 --> 00:25:03,362
Attack, attack, yes. Good thinking,
Humphrey. Yes, got it.

343
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,683
Miss Jenny Goodwin from The Guardian.

344
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:11,165
Do come in. Sit down, Jenny.
I may call you Jenny, may I not?

345
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:14,723
- If you like.
- Now, what seems to be the trouble?

346
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:19,089
Two things. Both of them
rather worrying to the public.

347
00:25:19,254 --> 00:25:22,563
The first is a story that was in the French press.

348
00:25:22,732 --> 00:25:27,330
It's about corruption in BES -
getting the Kumrani contract.

349
00:25:27,491 --> 00:25:31,848
- Complete nonsense!
- They quoted reports of payments to officials.

350
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:34,005
Really, this is absolutely typical.

351
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:38,085
A British company slogs its guts out
to win orders, create jobs!

352
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:41,246
What does it get from the media?
A smear campaign!

353
00:25:41,411 --> 00:25:46,201
- If they won by bribery...
- There was no bribery. I had a full inquiry.

354
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:50,331
- All these payments have been identified.
- What as?

355
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:56,572
- Commission fees, administrative overheads.
- Operative costs, managerial surcharges.

356
00:25:56,732 --> 00:25:58,964
Expenses, miscellaneous outgoings.

357
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:02,089
We have looked into every brown envelope...

358
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,732
...every...

359
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:08,964
...every account book
and everything is completely in order.

360
00:26:09,652 --> 00:26:11,848
- I see.
- May I say one thing?

361
00:26:12,013 --> 00:26:15,799
Allegations of this nature
are symptomatic of a very sick society

362
00:26:15,973 --> 00:26:18,612
for which the media shares the blame!

363
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:22,482
- The media?
- Why are you putting thousands of jobs at risk?

364
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:28,567
I'll call on the Press Council to censure the press
for its lack of professionalism in running this story.

365
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:31,929
The Council and the House of Commons
must be concerned

366
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:35,973
about the standards which have applied
in this disgraceful matter.

367
00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:41,491
Pressure will be brought to bear to make sure
that this gutter press reporting is not repeated.

368
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,768
I see. Ahem.

369
00:26:44,933 --> 00:26:47,129
Well, there is this other question.

370
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:52,081
It's about the rosewater jar
apparently presented to you in Kumran.

371
00:26:52,254 --> 00:26:55,402
- Yes?
- I saw it in your flat, actually.

372
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,964
- Yes, we're keeping it there, temporarily.
- Temporarily?

373
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:02,523
- Yes, it's very valuable.
- Mrs Hacker said it was an imitation.

374
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:04,683
Burglars, girl, burglars!

375
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:09,447
And you've gossip!
That's until we can get rid of it.

376
00:27:09,612 --> 00:27:14,447
- Get rid of it?
- I'll present it to our local museum this weekend.

377
00:27:14,612 --> 00:27:17,924
I can't hold onto it, you know.
It's government property.

378
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:21,130
Now... what was your question?

379
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:26,013
No... er... that's all right, actually.

380
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:29,371
Um... I... No, no, no, that's fine.

381
00:27:29,531 --> 00:27:32,366
- Nothing more?
- No, no, that's all.

382
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:35,125
Well, good of you to drop in.

383
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:37,683
- Thank you, Minister.
- Goodbye, Jenny.

384
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:43,643
Superb, Minister.

385
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,326
- Thank you, Minister.
- Oh, well, it was nothing.

386
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:53,487
We must stick by one's friends,
eh, Humphrey? Eh, Bernard?

387
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:56,250
Loyalty.

388
00:27:56,692 --> 00:27:58,763
(BOTH) Yes, Minister.

389
