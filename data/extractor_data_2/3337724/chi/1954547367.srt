1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,200
哇 你玩得真好
Wow, you're really good at this.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,300
大概是因为我重心比较低吧
Well, I have an extremely low center of gravity.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,360
我的体型和金字塔差不多
I'm like a pyramid.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,200
你怎么样了?
How you doing over there?

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,560
哦 但愿只是扭伤
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

6
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,930
我可不想再因为玩体感游戏
I cannot walk into that E.R.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,200
而受伤去看急诊了
with another video game injury.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,530
嘿 Sheldon 你要不要接我后面?
Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,930
我倒是想玩 不过我该走了
Oh, I would, but I'm on my way out.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,060
- 去哪?  - 德州
- Where?  - Texas.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,060
现在就走?
Right now?

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,160
为什么啊?
Why?

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,660
- 家里出事了?  - 是啊
- Is someone sick?  - Yes.

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,100
我姐姐的子宫里有了个婴儿
My sister's uterus came down with a baby.

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,130
哦 她怀孕了? 这是好事啊
Oh, she's pregnant? That's great.

16
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,100
你就要当舅舅了... Sheldon舅舅
You're gonna be an uncle... Uncle Sheldon.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,630
不 应该是Cooper博士舅舅
No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,760
你怎么从来没说过她怀孕了?
How come you never said she was pregnant?

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,730
我还没告诉过你我哥哥有肾结石呢
Well, I never told you about my brother's kidney stone.

20
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,030
你想听听我家人的生殖器里
You want to hear about everything

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,930
还会掉出来什么东西吗?
that comes out of my family's genitals?

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,700
好吧 祝贺你啊 
Well, congrats, and it's nice

23
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,900
- 而且你回去陪在你姐姐身边也很好啊  - 是啊
- you're gonna be there for your sister.  - Yes.

24
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,830
我是回去代替我姐夫的
I'm filling in for her husband who's recovering

25
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,100
他刚出了车祸 还在康复中
from a horrible motorcycle accident.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,400
算他走运
Lucky duck.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,130
哇 那你要去多久?
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?

28
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,000
她的预产期是明天
Well, she's due tomorrow.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,030
不过她花了六年才上完高中
Although it did take her six years to finish high school,

30
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,460
所以 谁知道呢?
so who knows?

31
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,700
用我开车送你去机场吗?
Can I give you a ride to the airport?

32
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,300
哦 不用 谢了 真的不用麻烦了
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want to be an inconvenience.

33
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,560

Sheldon今年不在这里了 所以再也没有什么
Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,600
装饰圣诞树的规则了

Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters

55
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,300
可以摆在同一个树枝上了?

56
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,630
我知道 太神奇了
I know, it's crazy.

57
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,630
准备好狂欢吧 小伙伴们!
Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,800
我以前从没这么干过
I've never done this before.

59
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,130
太有意思了
It's kind of fun.

60
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,230
是啊 要是你妈妈能看到
Yeah, if your mom could see

61
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,500
他的犹太小男孩现在的样子
her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,560
她一定会心脏病发作的
she'd have a heart attack.

63
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,960
说得对 我要拍张照片
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

64
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,060
亲爱的 我今年手头有点紧
Honey, I'm a little strapped for cash this year,

65
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,360
所以今年圣诞节我想送给你...
so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you...

66
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,230
这个
this.

67
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,560
爱死你了
I love it.

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,960
好啊
Okay.

69
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,930
不过你去年送我的也是这个

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,930
- 好像是  - 还有昨晚也一样

哦 真高兴你们没有等我来
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys

74
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,260
就开始了
didn't wait for me to start.

75
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,560
虽然你们说让我七点来
Although you said 7:00

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,300
而现在就是七点 不过无所谓啦
and it's... it's 7:00, but that's fine.

77
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,160
哦 估计是Sheldon
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

78
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,300
嗨 Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

79
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,600
大家都在呢 打个招呼吧
Everybody's here, say hi.

80
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
- 嘿  - 嘿  - 嘿 伙计
- Hey.  - Hey.  - Hey, buddy.

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,200
- 你好啊  - 嗨
- Howdy.  - Hi.

82
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,830
嗨
Hello.

83
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,130
我一走
The second I go out of town

84
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,360
你们就办了个圣诞节派对?
you throw a Christmas party without me?

85
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
算是吧
Yeah, kind of.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,660
这简直太贴心了
That's so thoughtful.

87
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,460
你们最懂我了
You guys are the best.

88
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,200
嘿 你姐姐怎么样?
Hey, how's your sister?

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,830
她一个小时之前开始阵痛了
She went into labor an hour ago.

90
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,300
不错啊 那你现在在医院?
That's wonderful. So you're at the hospital?

91
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,030
没有 她要在家里生孩子... 因为她想活在石器时代
No, she chose to have a home birth... because she wants

92
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,960
但是我们找不到山洞
to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasn't available.

93
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,130
其实很多人都觉得
You know, many people believe

94
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,160
在家生孩子更好 因为母亲处在一个
that home births are better because the mother

95
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,660
温暖舒适的环境当中
is in a warm, comfortable environment

96
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,660
而且身边照顾她的都是爱她的人
where she can be nurtured by loved ones.

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,430
还会把卧室的地板上
And turn the bedroom floor

98
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,260
弄得全都是羊膜
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

99
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,130
Shelly 过来!
Shelly, come on!

100
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,500
你姐姐的羊水破了
Your sister's fully dilated

101
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,660
她想在血流成河之前
and she wants a nice family picture

102
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,800
和家人照一张合影!
before there's blood everywhere!

103
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,500
天啊
Oh, boy.

104
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,960
今天就不该穿我最爱的这件机器人的T恤
I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt.

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,100
要是你怀了Sheldon的孩子
If you were having Sheldon's baby

106
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,030
你生孩子的时候想要他在屋里吗?
would you really want him in the room?

107
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,900
得了吧 如果她受孕的时候Sheldon在屋里
Yeah, if he's in the room when they're making the baby,

108
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,360
我就给你十美刀
I'll give you ten dollars.

109
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,860
嘿 我带了“生活多美好”那个电影过来
Hey, I brought over It's a Wonderful Life

110
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,500
你们一会要不要看
if you guys want to watch it later.

111
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,760
我喜欢那电影
Oh, I love that movie.

112
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,760
我没看过
I've never seen it.

113
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,660
- 我也没有  - 那电影很棒
- Me neither.  - It's great.

114
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,530
正值圣诞时节 Jimmy Stewart非常郁闷
It's Christmastime and Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

115
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,100
所以他决定跳桥自杀...
and he's gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself...

116
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,130
那不用看了 感同身受
Don't need to see it. Living it.

117
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,400
但之后 他看到了从未有他
But then he gets to see what the world

118
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
出生过的世界是怎样的
would be like if he'd never been born.

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
你能想象那是什么样吗?
Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like?

120
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,630
自己从未出生过?
Not being born?

121
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,360
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,760
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

124
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,730
你们嘲笑Sheldon
You make jokes about Sheldon,

125
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,060
但要不是因为他
but if it weren't for him,

126
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,430
我觉得我们大家
I don't think any of us

127
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,360
现在就不会聚在这儿了
would be sitting in this room right now.

128
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,000
真的? 就是因为Sheldon不在
Really? Sheldon not being here

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,630
我才会来这儿的
is the main reason I'm in this room.

130
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,630
我是说真的
It's true.

131
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:06,360
你们都不会认识我
None of you would know me.

132
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,130
你不会认识Bernadette
You wouldn't know Bernadette.

133
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,600
- 你也不会和Penny谈恋爱  - 这谁都说不准
- You wouldn't be dating Penny.  - You don't know that.

134
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,330
我去芝士蛋糕工厂很多年了
I've been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years.

135
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,460
也能认识她
I could have picked her up.

136
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,160
原来你不是开玩笑的
Oh, you weren't joking.

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
不是
No.

138
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,660
好吧 宝贝 我来告诉你
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you

139
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,600
事情会怎样进展
exactly how that would have gone down.

140
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,460
我决定了 我要约她出去
I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna ask her out.

141
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,700
我要从乳头挤出巧克力牛奶
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples.

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,060
抱歉 我以为我们在说
Sorry, I thought we're saying things

143
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,730
不可能发生的事情
that are never gonna happen.

144
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,160
也许这次他真的会做
Maybe this time he's going to do it.

145
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,930
希望你们渴了 我挤
Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.

146
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,200
等着瞧
Watch me.

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,500
嘿 你们打算点单 还是需要再看看?
Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?

148
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,800
我 呃 啊 嗯 我...
I, uh, ah, um, I...

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,200
那就是还需要再看看
A few minutes it is.

150
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,500
你没邀她出去 但也算发了很多声音
You didn't ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds.

151
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,130
你们弄得我太紧张了
You guys are making me nervous.

152
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,760
好吧 那你就自己过去跟她说
Fine, then go talk to her on your own.

153
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,700
我去了
I will.

154
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,100
抱歉
Excuse me.

155
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,300
什么事?
Yeah?

156
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,600
嗨 我叫Leonard?
Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?

157
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,530
真的? 感觉你自己都不确定
Really? You don't sound so sure.

158
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,400
不 我就是他
No, I am he.

159
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,960
好... 好吧
Uh, any... anyway, um,

160
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,030
我其实一直都想要
there's been something I've wanted to ask you

161
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,200
问你个问题 呃...
for a long time. Um...

162
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,030
- 什么问题?  - 好吧
- What's that?  - Eh, uh, well,

163
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,400
我在想... 如果你不忙...
I was wondering... if you're not too busy...

164
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,830
如果
um, uh, if,

165
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,360
如果你有兴趣...
if you'd be interested in...

166
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,660
能不能告诉我厕所在哪儿?
telling me where the restroom is?

167
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,000
我觉得你问得太晚了
I think you're too late.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,730
得了吧 我可不会尿裤子
Come on, I would not have peed my pants.

169
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,460
- 她真厉害  - 说得太对了
- She nailed it.  - Sounds about right.

170
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,230
但你忘了 现实生活中我成功邀你出去了
But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life.

171
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,760
如果不是因为有Sheldon 你碰巧就住在
Which couldn't have happened if you didn't live across the hall

172
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,060
她对面的房间 你也就不会成功了
from her, which couldn't have happened without Sheldon.

173
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,530
你们也是一样
Same goes with you guys.

174
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,900
如果Leonard没跟Penny在一起
If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

175
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,400
她就不会撮合你们俩
she never would have set you up.

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,230
无所谓 Bernadette还是会去
Doesn't matter. Bernadette still would've been working

177
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,560
芝士蛋糕工厂上班
at the Cheesecake Factory,

178
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,460
我也还是会努力练肌肉蛋糕工厂的
and I still would've been working this beefcake factory.

179
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,660
你肯定会爱死我的
You would've been all over me.

180
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,260
这个嘛...
Well...

181
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,700
嘿 Penny 那桌能交给我吗?
Hey, Penny, can I take that table?

182
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,830
当然 怎么了?
Sure, why?

183
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,960
那个短脖子的家伙很可爱
The one in the turtleneck is cute.

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,430
张大嘴
Open wide,

185
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,900
一大勺好吃的驾到
here comes the happy train.

186
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,160
嗯 嚼啊嚼 真美味
Mm-hmm, chug-a chug-a, yum, yum.

187
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,700
噢
Oh.

188
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,330
等等
Hang on.

189
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,760
你嘴边... 有点东西
You got a... you got a little something.

190
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,660
算了吧
Never mind.

191
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,360
天啊
Oh, man,

192
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,660
太有我们的风格了
that is so us.

193
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,930
好吧 也许我们俩不会在一起
You know, maybe you and I wouldn't be together,

194
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,760
但你自己也不会过得很好
but you wouldn't have done so great yourself.

195
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,230
- 为什么?  - 因为我知道
- Why?  - Because I know exactly

196
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,200
你最后会跟怎样的人在一起
the kind of guy you would've ended up with.

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,130
嘿 宝贝
Hey, babe.

198
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,800
嘿 你交了房租吗?
Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?

199
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,430
我干了件更好的事 我买了这些魔法豆
Better. I used the money to buy these magic beans.

200
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,760
好吧 他可能是有点白痴 但至少
Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least

201
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,430
他不会尿裤子
he didn't pee himself.

202
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,430
等等 还有一段
Oh, hold on.

203
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,360
宝贝 我尿裤子了
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

204
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,430
我也是
Me, too.

205
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,030
剧终
The end.

206
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,560
嗨 Sheldon
Hi, Sheldon.

207
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,860
一切都好吗?
Everything okay?

208
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,600
一点都不好
No, it's not.

209
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,600
我看到了点东西
I've seen things.

210
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,800
姑娘的东西
Lady things.

211
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,600
听我说
Listen to me.

212
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,230
那东西平时不是那样的
That is not the way they usually look.

213
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,900
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

214
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,500
制造新生儿真可怕
This is no way to make new humans.

215
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,660
人从人身体里出来
People coming out of people.

216
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,700
像是地下魔法表演
It's some kind of dirty magic show.

217
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,300
嘿 Sheldon Lee Cooper
Sheldon Lee Cooper.

218
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,100
你现在赶紧滚回来
You get back in this room right now.

219
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,400
带个拖把
Bring a mop.

220
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,730
听到了吗?
Did you hear that?

221
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,430
一个拖把
A mop.

222
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,860
我有两个博士学位 可还得
I have two PhDs yet somehow I'm the janitor

223
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,470
清理我姐的产道
of my sister's birth canal.

224
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,860
嘿 Sheldon给大家发了条邮件
Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail.

225
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,660
"在德州祝你们节日快乐"
"Happy holidays from Texas."

226
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,860
还发了图片过来
And there's pictures.

227
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,060
哦不!
Aah!

228
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,000
别看图片 千万别看
Don't open them. Do not open them.

229
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,060
哦 别这样
Oh, come on.

230
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,000
生孩子很自然 很可爱...
Childbirth is a natural, beautiful...

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,860
就好像奶牛被锯成两半了
Oh, it's like someone sawed a cow in half.

232
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,560
我父亲是妇科医生 我想我能承受
My father's a gynecologist, I think I can handle it.

233
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,730
好吧 我成基佬了
And, now, I'm gay.

234
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,930
知道吗 我在想 如果没有Sheldon
You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon,

235
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,400
我们也许就不会在一起
most of us would have never met,

236
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
但是Penny仍旧会是他们邻居
but Penny would still live across from him.

237
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,300
如果世上没有Leonard的话
And with Leonard out of the picture,

238
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,900
我们都知道会发生什么
we all know what that would mean.

239
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,400
知道吗?
We do?

240
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,360
嘿 Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

241
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,430
你好
Hello.

242
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,460
搓衣服?
Doing laundry?

243
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,760
当然我在搓衣服
Of course I'm doing laundry.

244
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,500
星期六是挫衣日
Saturday night is laundry night,

245
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,000
而且我在洗衣房 那么...
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,930
所以你的推理没错
I believe your inference is justified.

247
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,460
哦 好吧 我猜的不错
Oh, my inference is justified.

248
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,830
Sheldon 你真幽默
Sheldon, you are so funny.

249
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,330
总之 我也要搓我的衣服
Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too,

250
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,660
因为我的衣服很想被洗个遍
because these clothes are so dirty.

251
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,330
就好像穿着衣服的我也想被洗一下
Almost as dirty as the dirty girl who's wearing them.

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,030
好了 别意淫了
Okay, that's enough.

253
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,400
- 不同意  - 继续
- Disagree.  - Keep going. More.

254
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,030
怎么样?
So, what do you think?

255
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,960
两边有点不对称 不过没啥大问题
A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about.

256
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,460
求求你了 Sheldon 我需要你
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

257
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,830
要我... 干嘛?
To... what?

258
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,960
带我
To take me.

259
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,330
你不把衣服穿上 我哪儿也不带你去
I'm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.

260
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,960
来吧 Sheldon 你和我 就在这儿
Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here.

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,700
Penny 我和你说了一千遍
Penny, for the thousandth time,

262
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,860
我会一直为某人守身如玉
I'm saving myself for someone special.

263
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,830
也许是一位可爱的神经科眼镜妹
Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist

264
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,360
有着土黄色的头发
with hair the color of mud.

265
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,830
我知道我该怎么做了
I think I know how to change your mind.

266
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,960
够了吧
That's enough.

267
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,200
我还可以接受
I was okay with it.

268
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,830
那边如何了 Sheldon?
How's it going, Sheldon?

269
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,330
情况好多了
Actually, much better.

270
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,760
那好啊 孩子生下来了吗?
Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?

271
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,860
我不清楚 我才回房间里
I don't know. I just got back.

272
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,030
那你去哪儿了?
Where'd you go?

273
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:13,030
我老妈说让我去拿点毛巾
My mother asked me to get some towels.

274
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,260
听了她的模糊要求 我就小小利用了一下
I took advantage of the vague request

275
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,660
跑去毛巾店里逛了一圈
and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.

276
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,600
小点声! 我在打电话!
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

277
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,000
真没礼貌
So rude.

278
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,500
还有一条 Penny
Here's another one. Penny,

279
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,900
如果不是Sheldon
if it weren't for Sheldon,

280
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,330
{\an8}(蜘蛛侠 神奇四侠 X战警 绿巨人的作家)

281
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,330
你就不会知道著名漫画作家 斯坦李
you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee.

282
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
太好了
Great.

283
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,930
至少Leonard
At least Leonard,

284
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,000
我和Howard还会是好朋友的
Howard and I would have always been friends.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,760
那为什么你们三个没住在一起?
Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?

286
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,960
我们谈过这事的 但是Howard
We talked about it, but Howard was in

287
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,100
和他老妈互相离不开啊
a pretty serious relationship with his mom.

288
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,830
我和她一起住是为了省钱
I lived with her to save money.

289
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,160
对啊 你不用买啥吃的了
Yeah, you didn't have to buy groceries

290
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
因为你可以享受母乳
'cause you were breast-feeding.

291
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:03,530
我想如果不是我的话
Aw, so I guess if it weren't for me,

292
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,260
你还会和你老妈住一起?
you'd still be living with her, huh?

293
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,330
不一定
Not exactly.

294
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,600
什么叫"不一定"?
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

295
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,760
当然 情况肯定不一样了
Well, things would be a little different.

296
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,730
Howard 我午饭在哪儿?!
Howard, where's my lunch?!

297
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,860
我饿死了!
I'm starving!

298
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,400
我知道你很饿
I know you're starving.

299
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,230
邻居都知道你很饿
The neighbors know you're starving.

300
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,330
就连非洲饥民都知道你很饿!
There's starving people in Africa who know you're starving!

301
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,100
就这点?! 食物不够啊!
That's it?! There's not enough food!

302
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,200
你都把地球都扫遍了! 我不知道给你喂啥了!
Well, you cleaned out Earth! I don't know what else to do!

303
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,600
你还不是和你妈妈住一起?
How is this any different?

304
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,030
你还没让我说完
You didn't let me finish.

305
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:41,560
给你吧 老妈
Here you go, Mother.

306
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,030
你真是个好孩子 Howard!
You're a good boy, Howard!

307
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,860
你真是好孩子!
Such a good boy!

308
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,900
等下... 是她自己死了还是你杀的?
Wait... did she die or did you kill her?

309
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,660
西红柿还是番茄 她死了不就行了
Eh, tomato, tomato. The important thing is she's dead.

310
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,560
那你俩为啥没住在一起?
Hey, so how come you two didn't move in together?

311
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,300
他想要私人空间
This guy wanted a place of his own

312
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,460
因为他以为他一定能成为万人迷
because he was sure he was gonna be a ladies' man.

313
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,100
是啊 但我错了
Yeah, I was wrong.

314
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,130
但如果我们住一起 那咱也会很愉快的
But I do think you and I would have had a great time.

315
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,000
来吧 Leonard 晚饭好了
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,830
来了
Coming.

317
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:31,960
等下
Hang on.

318
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,500
为啥我这么胖?
Why would I be fat?

319
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,160
因为没有女朋友要看你裸体
You'd have no girlfriend to see you naked,

320
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,900
所以你空虚得只剩下吃了
you'd try to fill the void with food,

321
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,900
而我可是曾经做过油炸煎饼的人
and I'm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake.

322
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,630
为啥你不胖呢?
Why can't you be fat, too?

323
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,930
你甜点想要啥?
What do you want to do for dessert?

324
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,060
早上还剩下半个蛋糕
I think there's still half a cake from breakfast.

325
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,000
已经没了
No, there's not.

326
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,900
嘿 小伙伴们
Hey, guys.

327
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
- Stuart  - Stuart啊
- Stuart.  - Stuart.

328
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
你在干嘛?
What are you doing?

329
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,730
我...
I...

330
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,130
只是想参与到你们的故事里
just wanted to be in anyone's story.

331
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,360
但你为什么变胖?
Yeah, but why are you fat?

332
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,900
因为Leonard很胖
'Cause Leonard was fat.

333
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,530
Amy 那你呢?
Amy, what about you?

334
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,700
如果没和Sheldon在一起 你觉得你会怎样?
What do you think you'd be doing if you never met Sheldon?

335
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,830
我说不好
It's hard to say,

336
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,200
也许我的生活... 完全不同
my life would be so... different.

337
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,630
你可以说"活得更好" Sheldon又听不见
You can say "better." Sheldon can't hear you.

338
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,300
我不知道
I don't know.

339
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:46,530
# 祝我生日快乐 #
# Happy birthday to me #

340
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,330
# 祝我生日快乐 #
# Happy birthday to me #

341
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,930
# 泪水滴蛋糕上了 #
# There's tears in the frosting #

342
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,700
# 祝我生日快乐 #
# Happy birthday to me. #

343
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,930
人家不说了行了吧
I'll stop now.

344
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,030
怎么样了 Sheldon?
How's it going, Sheldon?

345
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,430
生了
That's it.

346
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,230
宝宝就在旁边
The baby's here.

347
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,430
是男孩
It's a boy.

348
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,100
- 恭喜  - 耶
- Congrats.  - Aw. Yay.

349
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,900
太感谢了
Oh, thank you.

350
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,000
我真怕自己做不到
I wasn't sure I was gonna to make it.

351
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,830
我妈给我买了刨冰
But my mother gave me some ice chips,

352
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,000
我姐告诉我要保持呼吸
my sister told me to breathe.

353
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
我不停地对自己说 "Sheldon
And I just thought to myself, "Sheldon,

354
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,060
"绿灯侠电影你都能忍
"if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie,

355
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,230
这次你一定行的"
you can make it through this."

356
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,560
你真棒 哥们
Well, good for you, buddy.

357
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,060
快回去吧
We'll let you get back in there.

358
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,930
哦 不 我可不想再去了
Oh no, no, I'm not going back in there.

359
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,660
新生儿真是太闹腾了
That baby is so irritating.

360
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,760
从出生到现在哭个不停
Has literally been crying his entire life.

361
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,900
哦 他已经继承了谢耳朵叔叔的衣钵了
Aw, he's already taking after Uncle Shelly.

362
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,160
快去吧 Sheldon 你应该过去
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.

363
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,330
为什么?
Why?

364
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,330
你总是抱怨在你成长的过程中
Well, you always complain that you never

365
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,330
没有一个充满智慧的榜样
had an intelligent role model growing up,

366
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,430
你现在可以为你的侄子做一个这样的榜样
and now you can be one for your nephew.

367
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,660
啊 好吧 我过去
Ugh, all right, I'll go.

368
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
但现在看来 他的集中注意力
But from what I've seen, his attention span

369
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,100
和膀胱控制能力一样糟糕
is as limited as his bladder control.

370
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,430
你真的说服他了
You actually got him to do it.

371
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,730
嗯 你总是说
Yeah, you keep saying

372
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,430
Sheldon对我们影响很大
how much Sheldon has affected all of us,

373
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,800
但是你对他的影响力也很大
but you've clearly had an impact on him.

374
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,400
要是真像你说的
If that were true,

375
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,330
我也不会到现在还独居了
I wouldn't still be living alone.

376
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,730
好吧 也不是独居
Well, not exactly alone.

377
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,960
我还有一袋50磅的大米
I do have a 50 pound sack of rice

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,660
外面罩着Sheldon的衣服
with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.

379
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,630
说实话 Sheldon比你想象的更在乎你
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think.

380
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:50,200
我希望你说的是真的
I wish I could believe you.

381
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,760
也希望大米袋子里面没老鼠
I also wish there wasn't a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.

382
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
等一下 我要提前送你
Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little

383
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,160
一个小圣诞礼物
early Christmas present.

384
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,660
我要给你看看这个 但如果你告诉Sheldon
I'm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon

385
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,560
他这辈子都不会理我了
he'd probably never speak to me again.

386
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,100
所以快点去告诉他
So, if you want to tell him, that's fine.

387
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,030
看
Look.

388
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,330
我不懂
I don't understand.

389
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,600
他把你的照片设成了屏保
He made you his screensaver.

390
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,660
哦
Oh.

391
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,760
哇
Wow.

392
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,000
我都不知道
I had no idea.

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,530
他这么稀罕我
He is so into me.

394
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,030
等一下
Wait, wait,

395
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,130
我的照片呢?
where'd I go?

396
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,460
哦 第一张是你 然后是沼泽怪
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,

397
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,530
史蒂芬·霍金 蜘蛛侠...
Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man...

398
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,960
但最起码 你也入选了
but, look, you're in the mix.

399
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
我也入选了
I am in the mix.

400
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
还是里面身材最火辣的
And I'm the hottest one.

401
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,460
那是谁?
Who's that?

402
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,160
哦 是居里夫人
Oh, Madame Curie.

403
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,230
没关系 她已经去世了
That's fine, she's dead.

404
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,430
你没事吧?
You okay?

405
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,760
你回来我太高兴了
Just really glad you're back.

406
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,360
我也很高兴
Me, too.

407
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,960
我有好多电视剧要补回来
I got a lot of TV to catch up on.

408
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,160
我好想你
I missed you.

409
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,430
{\an8}(星球大战里的角色)

410
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,430
韩·索罗说过 "我知道"
To quote Han Solo, "I know."

411
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,200
你想不想我?
Did you miss me?

412
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,830
我真希望你能陪我去
I would've preferred to have you there with me.

413
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,530
哦
Oh.

414
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,230
或者替我去
Or instead of me.

415
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,000
你抱小宝宝了吗?
Did you hold the baby?

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,600
抱了
I did.

417
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,060
那?
And?

418
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,500
有何感想?
How did it make you feel?

419
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,800
看着毯子里的小东西
Looking into the blank, innocent eyes

420
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,930
争着无辜的大眼睛
of a creature that couldn't begin to comprehend

421
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,700
理解不了我在说什么?
anything I was saying?

422
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,360
就和上班的时候一样
Basically just another day at the office.

423
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
我要上了
I'm gonna do it.

424
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,230
我要把她约出来
I'm gonna ask her out.

425
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,460
我的奶头能喷出巧克力牛奶
Yeah, and chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.

426
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,030
不上就闭嘴 你挤我就喝
Put up or shut up. You make it, I'll drink it.

427
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,730
- 你们还需要点什么吗?  - 呃
- You guys need anything else?  - Uh,

428
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,000
需要你的电话号码外加一个芝士蛋糕
your phone number and one more cheesecake.

429
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,500
不好意思 我有男朋友了
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

430
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,300
事实上 他已经来了
In fact, there he is now.

431
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,600
可以走了吗 亲爱的?
Ready to go, sweetheart?

432
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,660
不亲我一下我可不走
Not until I get my kiss.
