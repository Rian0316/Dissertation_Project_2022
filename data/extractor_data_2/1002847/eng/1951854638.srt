1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,550
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:03,860
Bree moved in...

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,220
You can stay as long as you want. 

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,110
mike went to rehab...

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,990
I will fix this.

6
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,960
Carlos faced a permanent illness...

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,850
She's not gonna leave you because you lost your sight.

8
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,280
you don't know gaby.

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,770
Dylan had questions about her father...

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,930
The only thing you need to know About 

11
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,410
that man is he was a monster. 

12
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,610
why would you not tell me that?

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,750
And adam uncovered a secret...

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,120
You told me it was all his fault.

15
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,160
Now I find out it was yours.

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,050
That one person wished he hadn't.

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,300
Katherine mayfair
Was not the kind of woman who liked to relive the past.

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,960
But when her husband adam left her,

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,420
Katherine's life began to unravel,

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,400
And the mistakes of her youth

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,720
Started to flash through her mind.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,550
She thought of wayne davis, the first man she married...

23
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,070
And the first time he had hit her.

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,470
She thought of how sincerely he apologized...

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,400
And how meaningless his apologies were...

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,950
And how she finally decided...

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,990
To hit back.

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,020
These were the thoughts going through katherine's mind....

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,160
When her friends and neighbors arrived...

30
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,550
Bearing gifts.

31
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,940
Well, hello there.

32
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,600
What's all this?

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,750
We brought you muffins.

34
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,730
And jam.

35
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,520
Okay, uh, what's the occasion?

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,700
Well, we heard you were having a rough time.

37
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,350
So we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.

38
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,530
Ah, so word is out that adam's left me,

39
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,530
And you thought thatmuffins and jam

40
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,870
Would help me pick up the pieces.

41
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,290
The jam was bree's idea.

42
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,510
- Susan! 
- I wanted to bring flowers, and I was shot down.

43
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,320
That's all I'm saying. 

44
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,310
katherine, we didn't come here to upset you.

45
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,880
No, we thought that you just might need someone to talk to.

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,240
No, you just thought you'd get the juicy details. 

47
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,390
no, we came here.

48
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,880
We wanted to help you, to fix you lunch or clean your house.

49
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:10,860
Or offer up our own houses for you to clean,

50
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,910
If that's your thing.

51
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,620
I'm fine, truly,

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,060
And I do appreciate your concern,

53
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,770
But... you know...

54
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,500
I told them you weren't into jam.

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,280
Susan!

56
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,840
Look, I don't mean to pry,

57
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,470
But given what I know about you and adam,

58
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,420
I'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving.

59
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,450
Well, bree, the truth is...

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,410
I really don't want to talk about it.

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,370
I understand, but whatever you do,

62
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,310
Don't keep your feelings bottled up.

63
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,000
You've got to let 'em out.

64
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,220
I'll do that.

65
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:19,730
Yes, katherine mayfair
Was not a woman who liked to relive the past.

66
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,520
But lately, her life had begun to unravel.

67
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,280
And she couldn't help thinking

68
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,770
Of all the mistakes she had made...

69
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,380
And especially...

70
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,000
The ones she had buried.

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,340
<font color="#4096d1">-==http://subland.5286.cn==-</font>

<font color="#4096d1">Desperate.Housewives.S04E11</font>

74
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,600
It happened once a week on wisteria lane Like clockwork.

75
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,020
The faithful would emerge from their homes

76
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,790
In their sunday best...

77
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,380
With their family bibles...

78
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,040
And their rosary beads...

79
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,930
And they would head off

80
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,140
To their various houses of worship,

81
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,950
Passing by a certain nonbeliever

82
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,010
Who had never taken an interest in their ritual.

83
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,500
But on this day,

84
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,310
Lynette scavo, for the first time in her life,

85
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,200
Was struck by something...

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,150
Something she would later think of

87
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,530
As divine inspiration.

88
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,310
We should go to church.

89
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,980
What? why? what did we do?

90
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,310
Ah, it's just...

91
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,330
We've been through a lot lately,

92
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,400
And we have a lot to be thankful for.

93
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,730
Don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?

94
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,400
Fine, fine. we'll go to church...

95
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:53,890
Next week.

96
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,170
-  I'm serious. 
- what's the rush? god will still be there next sunday.

97
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,460
The pistons, on the other hand...

98
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,030
They lose today, they're gone for good. 

99
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,230
so I'm clear,

100
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,030
You can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,830
Because the pistons have no defense?

102
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,570
Okay, look.

103
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,490
You didn't grow up going to church. I did.

104
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,030
My parents dragged me to st. anthony's every sunday.

105
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,920
I've done my time.

106
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,190
Well, I haven't.

107
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,350
I have some questions I would like answered.

108
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,160
And I don't know anything about god or jesus,

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,650
And our kids don't either. well,

110
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,730
you don't have to go to church to learn that stuff.

111
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,720
Yeah, I know about jesus.

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,530
See?

113
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,280
He's the guy who helps out santa claus.

114
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,020
Get dressed, kids. we're going to church.

115
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,050
Orson, I don't want to be late.

116
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,340
Services don't start 30.

117
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,570
 yes, but I'm sure edna fletcher has been there since 9:00,

118
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,930
Kissing up to reverend sykes.

119
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,490
- Is this about the ladies' auxiliary again?
-  damn right.

120
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,650
Bree, please, such language on a sunday. 

121
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,480
I am sorry, but I have to make sure

122
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,390
That he doesn't let her chair that committee. 

123
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,320
well, how could he? you plan every pancake breakfast.

124
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,520
You organize every bake sale. you'd be a saint

125
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,450
If our church believed in that sort of hogwash.

126
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,530
Exactly, and all the while, where was edna?

127
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,410
Lounging around in zimbabwe in the peace corps.

128
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,430
- She won't let any of us forget it.
-  well, I wouldn't worry.

129
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,540
Edna's "curing the village of dysentery" story

130
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,600
Has long since lost its novelty.

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,250
Oh, lynette. hi. you look pretty.

132
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,580
What are you all dressed up for?

133
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,240
Well, I decided I should go to church today.

134
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,430
Yeah, tom said the same thing.

135
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,310
Anyway, since you're the most religious person I know,

136
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,650
- I was wondering if you would take us to your church.
-  I would love that.

137
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,490
We're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.

138
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:49,290
Great! just give me a second to sell tom on the idea.

139
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,670
You know, he was raised catholic. 

140
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,290
oh, don't go catholic.

141
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,130
All that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--

142
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,020
I go for worship, not a workout.

143
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,290
Mm. not to mention the incense, which smells good at first

144
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,790
Until you feel your breakfast coming back up.

145
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
Okay.

146
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,770
Well, I'll be right back.

147
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,650
Oh, this is so exciting. I'm going to church.

148
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,650
By the way, what am I now?

149
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,150
Presbyterian.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,020
Right.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,100
Thank you. thank you for coming.

152
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,860
Oh, shoot.

153
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,490
Did I miss mass?

154
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,570
Was it at 9:00?

155
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:36,730
Yes, gabrielle. 9:00 mass is still at 9:00.

156
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,520
Oh, that's good to know.

157
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,840
Uh, father, can I talk to you?

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,180
Of course. I've actually been expecting you to come by.

159
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,750
Why?

160
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,100
Well, I thought you might need some comforting

161
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,200
After your husband's death.

162
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,270
Oh, that.

163
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,120
Yeah, I was a little blue,

164
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,220
But the good news is, I've bounced back.

165
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,250
Really?

166
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,420
Okay, this may come as a little shock to you...

167
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,940
But guess who's getting married again?

168
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,520
And I was thinking,

169
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,930
Maybe you could perform the ceremony.

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,600
Is tuesday good for you?

171
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,240
Uh...

172
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,660
Victor's only been dead two weeks.

173
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,350
Yeah, I know, but I'm no good single.

174
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,930
Honestly, I don't know how you do it.

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,660
Well, who is this man? did you just meet him?

176
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,590
No. no, no, no, no. it's carlos.

177
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,960
Carlos? i-i didn't know you two were even speaking.

178
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,690
Oh, yeah. we bumped into each other a few months ago,

179
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,740
And we just fell in love all over again.

180
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,090
Uh, a few months ago?

181
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,460
But you were married six months ago.

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,710
Boy, you are just determined to make this awkward, aren't ya?

183
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,020
Oh, gabrielle.

184
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,720
Okay, look, in the eyes of the church,

185
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,570
Carlos and I were never divorced.

186
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,880
Technically, the affair was with victor,

187
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,700
And god smote him.

188
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,000
So we're good.

189
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,430
All right, yes, I've been a bad catholic.

190
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,880
Enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?

191
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,360
Fine, as long as you promise

192
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,020
To stay married to carlos for the rest of your life.

193
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,680
Absolutely.

194
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,820
Oh, but if I don't, I promise you,

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,060
I will change religions.

196
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,700
Thank you.

197
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,950
Sorry. no, this is good.

198
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,410
Accountants always appreciate it when people take the time

199
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,900
To develop a sophisticated filing system.

200
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,960
Are you always this sarcastic with your clients?

201
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,080
Nope, just my favorite cousin.

202
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,440
I so appreciate you helping us out.

203
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,270
Mike would be doing our taxes, but he's off...

204
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,200
Getting better.

205
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,960
Mom told me. besides, I'm happy to have the work.

206
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,860
Yeah, I was sorry to hear about your job.

207
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,210
You know, ever since n.a.f.t.a.,

208
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,440
Corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the american worker.

209
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,620
Is that right? I heard somebody say that on n.p.r.,

210
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,390
And I just keep repeating it to people.

211
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,570
Actually, I wish I could blame losing my job on n.a.f.t.a.,

212
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,790
But it really has more to do with chloe.

213
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,800
My boss' daughter.

214
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,390
Oh, tim.

215
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,210
I don't know why he got so mad. I mean, she was 18.

216
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,620
Okay, so back to these receipts.

217
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,250
What is it about a girl in a cheerleader outfit?

218
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,570
Done catching up. all about accounting now.

219
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,660
Come on, susan. you're acting like I'm some sort of creep.

220
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,970
 no, i know you're not.

221
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,220
I mean, 18's legal.

222
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,570
I checked with a lawyer before I did anything.

223
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,580
These receipts are self-explanatory.

224
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,750
I'd even know why I'm here.

225
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,130
This is the nourishment

226
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,590
Each soul requires to go from acorn to oak.

227
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,600
And this is what should bring us peace in our hearts--

228
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,230
The blessed knowledge that god's love for us

229
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,490
Is as sure as the sunlight

230
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,770
And that it is always shining.

231
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,440
We only need see it.

232
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,910
- Amen? 
- amen........

233
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,750
Now if you'll take out your hymnals

234
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,080
And turn to page 335.

235
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,130
What are you doing?

236
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,060
 I've got a question about his sermon.

237
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,620
What? no. put your hand down.

238
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,920
It'll just take a sec.

239
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,760
 lynette, please, we don't do that here.

240
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,200
Uh, yes, can I help you?

241
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,240
Hi. I'm lynette scavo.

242
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,870
I'm a friend of bree hodge. and your sermon was lovely,

243
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,210
Especially the part about the trees.

244
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,630
Thank you. but here's where you lost me--

245
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,310
"god's love is as sure as the sunlight."

246
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,790
Yes, absolutely.

247
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,120
There. you have your answer. now sit.

248
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:46,680
The reason I ask is, there are wars all over the world,

249
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,030
And it seems like every month,

250
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,510
Some dumb-ass walks into a school

251
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,030
And starts shooting children.

252
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,450
So I'm thinking, god's love?

253
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,390
Not so sure.

254
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,110
Did she just say "dumb-ass"?

255
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,410
Ah, the eternal question--

256
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,550
"why do bad things happen to good people?"

257
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,170
What you have to remember is, god gave us free will.

258
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,770
Much of the evil in the world is brought on by man himself.

259
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,300
Oh, lord.

260
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,920
Yes, lynette?

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,020
Okay, I give you that one.

262
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,890
But what about the tornado that just happened?

263
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,760
You can't blame man for that.

264
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,150
Get the keys ready. we'll slip out the back.

265
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,330
you bring up a big theological issue,

266
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,830
One that deserves a lot more time to explore.

267
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,410
Why don't you come to our tuesday night bible study?

268
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,620
We can discuss it then.

269
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,150
Well, sure. I'm easy. thanks.

270
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,370
Katherine, dylan, hi. what's up?

271
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,400
Julie and I have a study date,

272
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,670
And my mom wants to apologize for being rude...

273
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,080
Again.

274
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,950
Is this about the other day?

275
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,780
Yes. you were just trying to help,

276
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,340
And I shouldn't have reacted the way I did.

277
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,490
Oh, please. after what you've been through,

278
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,410
No one is judging. come on in.

279
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,210
I'll put on some coffee.

280
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,500
Oh, um, this is my cousin tim. tim, this is the neighbors.

281
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,030
Mrs. davis?

282
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,380
Davis? nobody's called me that in years.

283
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,180
Do we know each other?

284
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,520
Oh, of course you do. that's right!

285
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,280
This is my cousin timmy.

286
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,270
He stayed with us

287
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,010
That summer that he went to band camp.

288
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,210
Oh! yes.

289
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,030
I remember.

290
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,060
Gosh, you're all grown up. it's nice to see you again.

291
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,730
You, too. hold it. is this little dylan?

292
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,050
Can you believe it?

293
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,430
Wow! the last time I saw you, you were pulling a wagon.

294
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,260
How old are you now? I turn 18 next week.

295
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,970
Really?

296
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,820
18?

297
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,520
Julie, dylan's here! study time!

298
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,270
I'm... sorry.

299
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:07,810
That was probably a little louder than it needed to be.

300
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,510
Edie, is that you?

301
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,350
Oh, my god. you knew it was me

302
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,200
Just from the sound of my footsteps?

303
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,150
No, from your perfume.

304
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,480
I smelled it the moment you hit the parking lot.

305
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,260
Look, there's no reason to be pissy.

306
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,560
I'm here to do something nice.

307
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,050
Really?

308
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,780
I feel bad about the whole losing-all-of-your-money thing.

309
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,840
Even though we know tornado-- clearly not my fault.

310
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,700
Anyway, i-i thought maybe this...

311
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,100
Would help.

312
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,120
It's the diamond bracelet you gave me.

313
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,750
It must be worth thousands of dollars.

314
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,280
Do you think you still have the receipt for it?

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,430
Uh... I think I threw it out.

316
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,220
Oh. well, you said it was from cartier, right?

317
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,690
I'm sure they have some sort of record.

318
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,660
Carlos?

319
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,490
Actually, the box was from cartier.

320
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,970
The bracelet's from...

321
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:17,380
A swap meet.

322
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,640
Hold it.

323
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,860
Are you saying

324
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,890
That those diamonds are cubic zirconias?

325
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,590
If we're lucky.

326
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,000
You son of a bitch. I gave you my heart,

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,780
And all you could give me was fake jewelry?

328
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,600
Edie... I'm sorry. I never thought you'd find out.

329
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,100
I just spat on one of your jell-o cubes.

330
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,600
Happy hunting.

331
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,690
Hey, you. do you know how long it's gonna be

332
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,870
Until carlos gets his sight back?

333
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,340
Because I have a 2-word sentence I'd like to say to him,

334
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,710
And there's a hand gesture that goes along with it.

335
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,120
I don't know. mr. solis' condition is very serious.

336
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,550
Serious? what's wrong?

337
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,120
Well...

338
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,140
You know, you should really talk to the doctor about this.

339
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,880
I don't even think his girlfriend knows.

340
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,810
You mean gaby?

341
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,720
I'm sorry. I said too much already.

342
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:28,660
Oh, please don't tell me that's your lunch.

343
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,270
Yeah. I'm sort of on a budget.

344
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,520
No, no, no. if you're gonna give quality care,

345
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,310
You're gonna need some quality food.

346
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,300
Now I know of this great, little french bistro.

347
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,770
It's the perfect place for lunch...

348
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,040
And conversation.

349
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,020
"your father was murdered."

350
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,920
Wow.

351
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,650
I know.

352
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you sure your aunt knew what she was writing?

353
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,970
She was pretty sick.

354
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,100
 no, she had it together, even on that last day.

355
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,520
I remember aunt lily really wanted to tell me something,

356
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,730
And then my mom just came in and stopped her.

357
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,870
Does your mom know you found this?

358
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,820
No, and I'm not gonna tell her either.

359
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,520
Why give her another chance to lie to me?

360
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,270
That's why I'm going to adam.

361
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,910
I can trust him to tell me the truth.

362
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,490
I just don't get it.

363
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,000
I mean, why would your mom lie about your dad being murdered?

364
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,790
Are you serious?

365
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,090
Julie...

366
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,850
She's the one who killed him.

367
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,390
Hi, babe.

368
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,530
I'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy.

369
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,660
Great, but close the curtain first.Last time,

370
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,320
 the nurse almost walked in When you were about to--

371
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,400
 carlos! I have a priest with me.

372
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,290
Priest? what, is there something
The doctors aren't telling me?

373
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,680
No, no, no. I wanted it to be a surprise,

374
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,260
But we're getting married!

375
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,180
Father, hit it.

376
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,790
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here

377
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,580
In the presence of-- whoa, whoa, whoa.

378
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,860
Gaby, what's the rush?

379
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,610
I don't know. just after everything we've been through,

380
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,840
There's nothing in our way now.

381
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,950
We can finally be together.

382
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,750
And I really need that.

383
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,880
I need a happy ending, carlos.

384
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,750
So what do you say? will you marry me?

385
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,120
Okay.

386
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,800
Holy matrimony. bring it on.

387
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,370
Gaby, before we get started,

388
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,860
There's something that I need to tell you...

389
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,960
In private.

390
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,570
Okay, he's gone. what's up?

391
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,560
Look, I haven't been completely honest with you

392
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,050
About the extent of my injury.

393
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

394
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,850
The doctor says...

395
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,100
I might not get my sight back.

396
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,300
For three months. four, tops.

397
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,320
I-i just want to make sure that you can handle that.

398
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,650
Wow.

399
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,640
That's... a really long time.

400
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,120
But for better or worse, right?

401
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,830
Right.

402
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,780
Okay, padre.

403
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,150
We're ready. let's take it from the top.

404
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,080
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of god

405
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,020
To join this man and this woman

406
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,070
In the holy sacrament of matrimony.

407
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,100
You're out of milk. you want me to pick some up?

408
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,750
No, that's okay. it can wait.

409
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,110
I don't mind. I could use a little air anyway.

410
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,540
Tim! where's that milk?

411
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,790
Oh, I thought you didn't want any. uh...

412
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,520
I'm having a baby.

413
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,070
I can't give birth with brittle bones. go!

414
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,180
Bye!

415
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,770
Hey, church buddy. look what I got.

416
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,060
Wow, you bought a bible.

417
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,240
Yeah, and I'm breaking her in tonight.

418
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,480
Nothing like that new bible smell.

419
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,910
Oh, so you're...

420
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,880
Coming to bible study. 

421
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,000
yeah, and I hope the reverend's ready,

422
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,760
Cause I got about a zillion questions for him.

423
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,170
Lynette, i-i realize

424
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,110
You don't have much experience with churches,

425
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,950
So this really isn't your fault.

426
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:57,940
What isn't my fault?

427
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,210
Well, last sunday, when you kept raising your hand...

428
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,460
We don't really do that.

429
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,860
The church isn't a place for questions.

430
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,480
It's a place for answers.

431
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,150
Yeah, but how do you get the answers

432
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,830
If you don't ask the questions?

433
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,110
Well, typically, we sit there and let the preacher preach,

434
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,550
And eventually, our questions are answered,

435
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,620
And no one is humiliated.

436
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,780
I'm sorry. did I embarrass you on sunday?

437
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,340
Well, it's just that in our church,

438
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,840
People don't talk back to the minister.

439
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,710
Well, what if I need to?

440
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,290
What if that's the kind of church I'm looking for?

441
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,090
Well, then maybe you should explore other options.

442
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,210
I mean, if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit,

443
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,660
Why don't you try

444
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,120
That gospel church by the airport?

445
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:46,550
Okay.

446
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,710
Or, uh, the unitarians.

447
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,720
From what I hear, those folks are "anything goes."

448
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,080
Hey, adam. it's dylan.

449
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,130
I waited at your hotel all day, but you never came back.

450
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,910
You have to call me. I found this note that aunt lily wrote.

451
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,040
Mom threw it in the fireplace, but I fished it out,

452
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,150
And I have to talk to you.

453
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,840
Call me on my cell, not at home, 'cause i--

454
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,180
She doesn't know anything. 

455
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,580
I can hear it in her voice.

456
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,310
But she's got the note. 

457
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,230
maybe a few burnt pieces.

458
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,450
Trust me, all she's got are questions.

459
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,620
Well, I could, um, refuse to see her.

460
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, 'cause that won't arouse her suspicion.

461
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,320
No. you are going to ask her to come here,

462
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,560
And then you're going to find out Exactly what she knows and what she doesn't.

463
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,730
After all these years, maybe it would be easier just to finally tell her the truth.

464
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,420
And you would just wave good-bye as they cart me off to jail?

465
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,280
She wouldn't call the police.

466
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,500
Seriously, I think you two have a great relationship.

467
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,030
Then you have not been paying attention.

468
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,740
Give me a chance to get home,

469
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,270
Then call her and set up a time for you two to meet. 

470
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,450
okay.

471
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,950
You know...

472
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,790
When you called me tonight,

473
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:22,250
I was half hoping you missed me.

474
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
Really?

475
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,510
I miss you.

476
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,770
I'm so terribly lonely.

477
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,140
You know I don't do well on my own.

478
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,530
Is there any chance we could...

479
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:47,740
Get past this, and you could come back home?

480
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,840
I will talk to dylan.

481
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,440
I will provide you one last alibi.

482
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,650
After that, I'm done.

483
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,510
Are you guys outta here? 

484
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,940
yes, I'm gonna run some errands,

485
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,990
And orson's gonna take benjamin to the park.

486
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,170
Actually, I thought I might take him to the museum.

487
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,830
You know how much benjamin loves matisse.

488
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,160
Benjamin doesn't love matisse. 

489
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,400
he loves purple. 

490
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,400
Please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual.

491
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,110
If you saw how her first two turned out,

492
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,860
You'd understand how important it is for me to fight the van de kamp d.n.a.

493
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,850
Hey, it's tim.

494
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,880
It was great seeing you the other day.

495
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,350
Yeah, I can't stop thinking about you either.

496
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:09,850
So listen, um, I've got the whole place to myself.

497
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,470
You wanna come over?

498
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,940
Hey, gaby.

499
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,930
I heard you and carlos got married yesterday.

500
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,920
Guess this means you win.

501
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,040
Oh, edie, it wasn't a competition,

502
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,080
But, yeah, I guess I did.

503
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,370
Yeah, but I think it's all for the best.

504
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,150
I mean, after all, I could have never been the hero that you're about to be.

505
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,230
Hero? why am I a hero?

506
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,590
Committing your life to a man who's blind?

507
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,710
My god, you're gonna have to do everything for him--

508
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,770
Dress him, shave him, lead him to the bathroom,

509
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,900
Pray that his aim is halfway decent. 

510
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,140
it's not a big deal.

511
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,360
Carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months.

512
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,580
Four, tops.

513
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,400
Is that what he told you? 

514
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,730
you poor, gullible fool.

515
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,120
What are you talking about?

516
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,610
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

517
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,370
But I talked to the nurse,

518
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,620
And she said that his condition is...

519
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,340
Oh, what's the word? um...

520
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,550
Oh, yeah.

521
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,530
Permanent.

522
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,290
I don't believe you.

523
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,710
Call the doctor if you'd like.

524
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,240
And apparently, he was begging carlos to tell you.

525
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,150
No. no, no, no. this can't be true.

526
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,440
Look on the bright side.

527
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,080
Women who are married to blind guys

528
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,660
Don't have to worry about makeup or getting fat.

529
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,000
Are you sure you didn't already know about this?

530
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,280
Okay, I'm calling dr. dunlap.

531
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,290
You do that. 

532
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,310
oh, and by the way,

533
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,620
Congrats on your big win.

534
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,860
So how's your occupational therapy going?

535
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,180
Do they still have you scrubbing pots in the kitchen?

536
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,410
No, no. once they found out I'm a professional plumber,

537
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,860
I got promoted to scrubbing toilets. 

538
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,800
mm, well, maybe you won't mind Doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week. 

539
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,950
Actually, the doctors kinda frown on that.

540
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,170
They encourage us to leave that sort of stuff behind.

541
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,180
Well, it doesn't have to be toilets.

542
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,020
I mean, it could be sinks, bathtubs.

543
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,810
You're making me wanna use, susan.

544
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,950
This junkie thing's awesome.

545
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,150
Oh, I forgot. uh, tim has some questions about the taxes.

546
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,020
Do you mind talking to him? 

547
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,500
no, I don't mind. 

548
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,790
though I can't believe he'd have any trouble with your cookie tin filing system.

549
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,710
Hello? hey, uh, tim, I've got mike here.

550
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,700
Do you want to talk to him?

551
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,520
Uh, can I do that later? I'm sort of taking a nap.

552
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,350
What was that? is someone there?

553
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,850
What? no. no. unh-unh. no--no one's here.

554
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,820
Really? cause it sounded like a girl.

555
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,690
No, uh, it--it was just the tv.

556
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,620
I thought you were taking a nap.

557
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,490
Uh, the tv helps me sleep.

558
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,970
Uh, tell mike I'll call him later.

559
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,580
I've gotta go.

560
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,700
What? what? you just got here.

561
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,700
I know, but this visit was really more for julie.

562
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,440
For me? 

563
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,340
yeah, you're going to college soon,

564
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,000
And I want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs.

565
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Scare her straight, mike.

566
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,660
Honey, you down here?

567
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,470
Yes, sweetheart.

568
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,860
I'm in the kitchen making dinner.

569
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,130
M smells good.

570
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,930
It's a new recipe for beef stew.

571
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,690
I think you're gonna love it.

572
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,430
Why don't we let that simmer?

573
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,600
During my nap, I had the filthiest little dream.

574
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,190
I was kinda hoping maybe we could...

575
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,020
Skip straight to dessert?

576
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,450
Yeah.

577
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,150
What do you say?

578
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,850
I'd say I'm one step ahead of you.

579
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:47,980
I have already slipped into my pink lace teddy,

580
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,600
And I'm wearing those whore-y pumps that you love.

581
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,430
Ooh, I like that image. 

582
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,430
where are you?

583
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,490
I'm right here, babe.

584
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,080
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that was open.

585
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,270
Let's do it over here, on the table.

586
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,810
Can you give me a hand?

587
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,500
Can't. my legs are in the air.

588
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,150
Just follow the sound of my voice.

589
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,580
There you go.

590
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,450
I'm over here, sweetie.

591
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,030
Whoa! uhh! son of a bitch!

592
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,230
Ooh, I meant to move that.

593
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:26,750
Hang on. let me just pull my panties up so I can help you.

594
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,450
Okay. here.

595
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,730
Let's go do it over here.

596
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,820
Aah! damn it! what the hell is going on?!

597
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,320
I'll tell you what's going on.

598
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,980
"in three months. four, tops."

599
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,300
Uh-oh.

600
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,600
"uh-oh" is right, you blind bastard!

601
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,380
Ow! all right, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have lied! 

602
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,180
oh, no, no.

603
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,970
i think it was a fantastic plan.

604
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:58,640
I mean, there's no way I ever would have figured out that I was married to a permanently blind guy!

605
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:03,080
All right, I just thought that by the time you did,

606
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,890
You'd be used to the idea,

607
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,130
And maybe then you wouldn't leave me.

608
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,020
Leave you?

609
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,480
Do you really think I'm that shallow?

610
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,270
Gaby, I'm poor and I'm blind,

611
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,500
And let's face it.

612
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,700
There is nothing about that that is your type.

613
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
Wow. thanks for the vote of confidence.

614
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,710
Y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out,

615
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,760
But I would have come around.

616
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,120
If you had just had a little faith in me,

617
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,190
I could have proven to you that I was up for the challenge,

618
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,840
But you robbed me of that chance. 

619
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,370
I'm sorry.

620
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,430
Good.

621
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,950
To avoid future confusion, I love you,

622
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,460
And I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

623
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,150
Gaby, this is not going to be easy.

624
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:00,070
I know,

625
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,430
But like I said,

626
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,160
"for better or for worse."

627
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,180
Think you can forgive me?

628
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:14,760
I'll work on it.

629
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,490
While you're working on it,

630
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,140
Mind if I dig into some of that stew?

631
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,920
Sure.

632
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,590
Ugh! get off that poor girl right now!

633
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,360
I finished your taxes.

634
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,800
What the hell is going on here? 

635
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,710
susan, I'm so sorry.

636
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,630
No, katherine,

637
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,890
I know what you've been going through emotionally,

638
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,320
So you don't have to apologize.

639
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,440
And by the way, your boob is out. oh.

640
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,860
You, on the other hand--

641
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,760
I know. I know.

642
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,720
I don't understand you. 

643
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,950
Is this something you do?

644
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,120
You worm your way into a neighborhood with the promise of free tax preparation,

645
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,850
And then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorc镋? 

646
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,390
hey!

647
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,260
It's not like that. she came over for some drinks,

648
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,060
And we got to talking and started reminiscing,

649
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,150
And all these old feelings came rushing back.

650
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,530
Oh, nice try, timmy. 

651
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,590
like I'm really going to believe that.

652
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,440
Shame on you. just... shame!

653
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,560
What do you mean, "old feelings"?

654
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,830
Do we really need to get into this?

655
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,000
What do you have to reminisce about?

656
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,190
He was here for a week when he was 16.

657
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,300
What could you two have even...

658
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,610
Oh, my god, you slept together.

659
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,130
Okay,

660
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,980
before you get some sordid image in your head-- 

661
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,310
she took my virginity.

662
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,880
Do you have to say it like that?

663
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,360
that's how I said it to every single guy at band camp.

664
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,510
Shame on you!

665
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,210
His mother trusted me to take care of him,

666
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:01,070
And you swoop in like some swooping, sex-craved--

667
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,680
Oh, for god sakes, tim! pull up the blanket!

668
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,960
You can't blame it on katherine. 

669
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,520
I knew exactly what I was doing.

670
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,950
I don't want to hear this. I'm done with both of you.

671
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:11,530
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the mall...

672
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,900
Buying sheets.

673
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,440
Good morning. 

674
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,030
I'll see you after service.

675
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,190
Oh! good morning, reverend.

676
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,790
I brought your favorite-- blueberry scones.

677
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:23,510
Thank you, bree.

678
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,130
By the way, I'm sorry I've taken so long

679
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,390
To make a decision about the ladies' auxiliary.

680
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,680
Oh, is that happening now? 

681
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,410
I'd forgotten all about it.

682
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,540
So is your, uh, delightful neighbor coming?

683
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,560
The one with all the questions?

684
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,350
Delightful? I thought she annoyed you.

685
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,720
No, I found her refreshing.

686
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,480
It's like I always say.

687
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,630
Church is not a place for answers.

688
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,750
It's a place for questions.

689
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,620
You don't say that.

690
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,850
I've--i've never heard you say that, not once. 

691
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,160
yes, well, anyway,

692
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,370
I want to thank you for taking the initiative.

693
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,540
New members are crucial to the health of this church.

694
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,550
I won't forget you brought them... or these.

695
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,390
Thank you, reverend,

696
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,830
And I'm--i'm sure the scavos will be here soon.

697
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,720
Why did you just say that?

698
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,310
You know very well they went to catholic church.

699
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,320
Which is just down the street. 

700
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,740
I'll be right back.

701
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,530
Psst!

702
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:22,670
Not you.

703
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,260
Lynette.

704
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,270
What are you doing here?

705
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:29,850
I was gonna ask the same of you.

706
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,860
Why are you in a catholic church?

707
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,150
Because we're catholic. 

708
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,220
oh, please.

709
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,010
Mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt doesn't make you catholic.

710
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,800
You're presbyterian now. come on. let's go.

711
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,860
Weren't you the one who said I should explore other churches?

712
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,460
I meant sample, like a buffet.

713
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,780
You take a little plate of everything,

714
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,700
And then you sit down for the main course,

715
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,650
Which is across the street...

716
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,260
At the presbyterian church.

717
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,140
No. I just put 10 bucks in the collection plate,

718
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,690
And I'm gonna get my money's worth. 

719
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,690
is there a problem?

720
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,310
No, no problem. just talking to my friend. 

721
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,910
she's trying to poach her.

722
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,060
I am not!

723
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,340
My friend's just a little confused.

724
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,040
She forgot that she's presbyterian

725
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,860
And wandered into the wrong church.

726
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,310
I'm not presbyterian.

727
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,620
I'm a free agent.

728
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,260
And if you're open to a little q and a, you've got me.

729
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,210
Lynette, please.

730
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:25,300
Can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?

731
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,510
Okay, what gives?

732
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,630
Well, I was at the service this morning,

733
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,180
And it's just not the same without you. 

734
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,750
bree...

735
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,470
And I am... up for the head of the ladies' auxiliary,

736
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,690
And reverend sykes was so impressed that I brought a new family into church, so...

737
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,880
If you don't come back, then--

738
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,600
Oh, then you won't get what you want? 

739
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,150
well, yes.

740
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,160
Well, forget it.

741
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Let someone else help you with your power grab.

742
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,280
Lynette!

743
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,650
You were the one who came to me. 

744
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:58,800
you sought me out.

745
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,120
Yes, and do you know why?

746
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,820
Because out of all my friends,

747
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,230
You are the one who had real faith.

748
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,560
You had an actual relationship with god.

749
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
At least, that's what I thought.

750
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:10,970
Lynette--

751
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,980
Because I have had a rough few months. 

752
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,150
okay?

753
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,900
But I know you've had rough times, too,

754
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,270
And I always assumed that your faith had helped you get through them.

755
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,730
I envied you that, to be honest.

756
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,680
It did. it did help me.

757
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,510
Really?

758
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,040
Okay. how?

759
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,990
It just did.

760
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,590
Well, that's not a good answer.

761
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,440
I have been through cancer and a tornado,

762
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,990
And I don't know why I survived, and so many other people didn't.

763
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,530
I don't understand, and I need to.

764
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,330
Lynette, why didn't you tell me?

765
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,050
Why didn't you ask?

766
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,470
Oh, that's right.

767
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,540
You don't like asking questions.

768
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,700
Hey, lynette.

769
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,250
Hi there.

770
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:21,740
Just... wanted to tell you that I'm out of the running for the ladies' auxiliary.

771
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,340
I told reverend sykes to, uh, give it to edna fletcher.

772
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,850
She was in the peace corps, you know.

773
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,890
Huh. that's nice of you.

774
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,550
I suppose. I just wanted to let you know that.

775
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:37,780
And also to... apologize.

776
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,630
Oh, you don't have to do that.

777
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,710
Yes, I do. you were right. faith shouldn't be blind.

778
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,380
You don't threaten it by asking questions.

779
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,790
You make it stronger, and I lost sight of that.

780
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,880
Well, maybe a little.

781
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,710
And it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance, and...

782
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,820
I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you.

783
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,690
I want you to have faith in me and our friendship.

784
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,340
Well...

785
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,150
There are some things that are easy to believe in.

786
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,270
How's catholicism going, by the way?

787
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,420
Meh.

788
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:22,470
Well, if you ever wanna try us again...

789
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,220
Oh, well, I'm pretty comfortable with the catholics.

790
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,000
They're the only ones who don't judge me for having so many kids.

791
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,810
Hey.

792
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,360
Hey.

793
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,640
Okay, so I have to ask.

794
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,930
This thing that happened with you and katherine 12 years ago--

795
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,050
Was it an ongoing affair?

796
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,460
No. no, it was just the one time,

797
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,670
And I think she felt pretty guilty about it afterwards.

798
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,040
She told me not to come around anymore.

799
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,490
So you didn't go back?

800
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,410
It's weird. I tried to.

801
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,400
It was the last night of my visit.

802
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,310
I thought if I brought her some flowers,

803
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,730
Maybe I could get something going, you know?

804
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,370
But when I got up to the front door,

805
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,890
I heard all this yelling....

806
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,570
- say good night to my daughter.
- She is asleep. get the hell out.

807
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,540
I went around to the window

808
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,630
Just to get a look at what was going on... 

809
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,360
- remember? she's my daughter!
- I'm her father! 

810
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,440
and I could see she was having a fight with someone.

811
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,120
I was about to rush in and help her When I saw katherine pick up this candlestick

812
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,270
And just wail on him.

813
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,530
He went down pretty hard.

814
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:35,390
Katherine was just standing over him With this look in her eye.

815
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:37,960
It scared the hell out of me, 

816
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,350
so I got out of there.

817
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,000
I left the next morning and never talked to katherine again.

818
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,360
So... this man-- who do you think it was?

819
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,620
Don't know.

820
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,420
I sort of got the impression he was her ex-husband.

821
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,760
Does she ever talk about him?

822
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,150
Not really.

823
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,040
have you seen him lately?

824
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,430
No.

825
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:13,710
Ever since I can remember, I've had this feeling

826
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,190
That something's not right.

827
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,110
Weird dreams that don't seem like dreams at all.

828
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,530
People telling me I forgot things

829
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,950
That I know I would've remembered.

830
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,310
And now finally,

831
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:36,580
I find a sentence on a piece of paper...

832
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,820
That could explain all of it

833
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:41,670
And prove that I am not crazy.

834
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,860
And the best that you can come up with

835
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,500
Is that aunt lily was losing it

836
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,960
And she didn't know what she was writing?

837
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,500
I need the truth, adam.

838
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,160
Please.

839
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,540
Please.

840
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,510
The truth, dylan...

841
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,720
Is that...

842
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:15,780
Your mother didn't kill your father.

843
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,070
And she loves you more than you will ever know.

844
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,490
Faith is a belief in something

845
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,820
That cannot be proven.

846
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:42,790
So we trust in the words Of the only father we've ever known.

847
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,590
We believe the promises of the woman who shares our bed.

848
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:58,970
We rely on the example of dear friends who help us to be better people.

849
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,930
Yes, we all want to believe in those we are closest to,

850
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,050
But where there is doubt,

851
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,080
Our faith begins to vanish...

852
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,220
And fear rushes in to take its place.

853
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


854
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
