1
00:00:03,723 --> 00:00:05,882
好了 大家聚过来
Okay, everybody, gather 'round.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,798
谁能想到今天是"带女朋友上班"日?
Who knew it was "bring your girlfriend to work" day?

3
00:00:10,352 --> 00:00:12,635
她不是我女朋友
She is not my girlfriend.

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:14,137
Judy是心肺复苏娃娃
Judy is a CPR doll,

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:17,690
也是这家餐厅里最努力干活的姑娘
and the hardest-working girl in this diner.

6
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:21,367
哦 Han 你不该把你的性玩偶带到公共场合
Oh, Han, you shouldn't bring your sex doll out in public.

7
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:25,644
这不是我女朋友 也不是性玩偶!
This is not my girlfriend or a sex doll!

8
00:00:25,646 --> 00:00:27,379
Earl 过来
Earl, come over.

9
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,815
我们要用Judy来学习复苏方法
We're going to use Judy to learn how to resuscitate.

10
00:00:30,078 --> 00:00:32,745
我有"不要复苏"的条款
I have a "do not resuscitate" clause,

11
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:36,082
同样的 我也不会复苏别人
as in, I do not resuscitate others.

12
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:37,583
Oleg 过来
Oleg.

13
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:38,768
怎么了 Han?
What's up, Han?

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,169
哦 嘿 Judy
Oh, hey, Judy.

15
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,557
你怎么认识Judy?
How do you know Judy?

16
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,761
有这待身躯的美娇娘 能横行天下
With a torso like that, she gets around.

17
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:51,230
好了 我来演示一下
Okay, I will demonstrate.

18
00:00:51,232 --> 00:00:52,765
哦 不!
Oh, no!

19
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:55,818
Judy被东西呛到了!
Judy's choking on something!

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,487
我们知道这不是你
Well, we know it's not you.

21
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:02,274
首先 你要把头后仰
First you have to tilt the head back

22
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,577
让呼吸畅通 然后吹气
and clear the airway and blow.

23
00:01:05,997 --> 00:01:07,446
哦 Max 我想我们正在见证
Oh, Max, I think we're witnessing

24
00:01:07,448 --> 00:01:10,666
他的初吻
his first kiss.

25
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:13,686
第四次 谢谢
Fourth, thank you very much.

26
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:16,639
Han 你干嘛浪费时间亲她?
Han, why are you wasting your time kissing her?

27
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,790
她都没有手
She doesn't have any arms.

28
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,525
直接做吧
Just go for it.

00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,768
大家好吗? 今天是个重大日子
What's up, everybody? Big day today.

32
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:44,216
虽然没圣诞节那么重大 但这标志着
Not as big as Christmas, but still marks the arrival

33
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:47,605
有人的幸福时刻即将来临 就是我
of someone very blessed: me.

34
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:48,895
好 我们懂了
Yeah, we get it.

35
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:49,850
你说起自己的生日
You talk about your birthday

36
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:53,585
比坎耶・维斯特(歌手)说唱自己的名字还多
more than Kanye West talks about Kanye West.

37
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,789
Caroline 我还以为你会哭呢
Caroline, I thought you would be crying.

38
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,041
能预料到你会在生日时泪崩
Tears on your birthday have become as expected

39
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:01,968
就如能料到前迪士尼明星会去戒毒所一样
as an ex-Disney star going to rehab.

40
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,330
我为什么要伤心?
Why would I be sad?

41
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,882
我拥有健康 和正在萌芽的生意...
I have my health, a business that's budding...

42
00:02:06,884 --> 00:02:08,726
但却没有胸
Boobs that aren't.

43
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:12,087
我不过生日
I don't believe in birthdays.

44
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,139
只有心态才能决定你的年龄
You're only as old as you feel.

45
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:16,342
这会让我永远年轻
Which makes me nothing years old.

46
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:20,763
说到"年轻"...
Speaking of nothing...

47
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,932
Caroline 我们今晚照旧去"双靴"披萨店吗?
Caroline, are we still on for Two Boots pizza tonight?

48
00:02:23,934 --> 00:02:26,769
为了庆祝你的生日 我会早点关门
I'm closing the diner early in honor of your birthday,

49
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,269
绝不是因为
and just not because the city

50
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,940
市里要求检查黑曲霉的情况
has demanded to look into the black mold situation.

51
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:33,809
当然了 Han
Absolutely, Han.

52
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:35,611
你可以点一份披萨加两种配汁
You can have one slice with two toppings

53
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,396
也可以点两份披萨加一种配汁
or two slices with one topping,

54
00:02:37,398 --> 00:02:39,164
还有 我的生日蛋糕是免费的果馅饼
and my birthday cake is a free flan

55
00:02:39,166 --> 00:02:41,900
因为我跟洗碗工调情了
'cause I flirted with the dishwasher.

56
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:43,936
Caroline 亲爱的 我要是你
Caroline, sweetheart, if I was you,

57
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:47,339
我会直接撞穿厚玻璃板的窗户
I would just put my head through a plate glass window.

58
00:02:49,844 --> 00:02:51,293
好了 各位
Okay, everybody.

59
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:54,013
我有两个通知 都是好消息
I have two announcements, both good news.

60
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,965
第一 那个在三明治里发现鸟喙的人
First, the guy who found the beak in his sandwich

61
00:02:56,967 --> 00:03:00,686
决定不起诉了 第二
is not suing, and second,

62
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:04,890
我打算向Sopie表露个问题
I'm gonna pop the question to Sophie.

63
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,142
反正你已经把什么都给露了
Well, you've already popped everything else.

64
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,280
你们怎么看?
What do you think?

65
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:13,365
他们说钻石是女孩子最好的朋友
They say diamonds are a girl's best friend.

66
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:14,356
哦 真的吗?
Oh, really?

67
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,357
我以为女孩子最好的朋友是
I thought a girl's best friend

68
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,903
某个只比她胖一点的人
was someone just a little fatter than her.

69
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:20,706
这是我远在俄国的奶奶的
It was my grandma's from Russia.

70
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,458
我让我表妹Svela吞了它
I had my cousin Svela swallow it

71
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,626
以便带来美国
to bring it to America.

72
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:28,213
她过了海关以后 把这个拉出来的
She passed customs, then she passed this.

73
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:34,002
喝了五六瓶漱口水后 嘭!
Five, six rinses later, boom!

74
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,554
免税
Duty free.

75
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:42,227
好吧 看来这个比在婚戒店买的要好
Well, I guess that's better than getting it at Kay.

76
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:43,812
Sophie想要这个吗?
Is Sophie expecting it?

77
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:44,897
当然
Of course.

78
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,181
她不喜欢惊喜
She doesn't like surprises

79
00:03:46,183 --> 00:03:48,016
因为她家谷仓曾被
since her family barn was torched

80
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:51,036
一个精神不稳定的雇农给烧了
by a mentally unstable farmhand.

81
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:54,907
你好 这里有个快递 是Martin Channing
Hi, I have a delivery for Caroline Channing

82
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:56,358
送给Caroline Channing的
from Martin Channing.

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,743
哦 这是我爸爸给我的礼物
Oh, it's a birthday gift from my daddy

84
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:58,861
从监狱寄过来的
all the way from prison.

85
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,162
去年 他给了我
Last year, he made me

86
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,915
一个通心粉做的艺术画架
a macaroni art picture frame.

87
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:05,451
他可是曾经把迈阿密
I mean, the man once rented Miami

88
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,337
租给一个朋友开单身派对的人
for a friend's bachelor party.

89
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:12,207
嘿 那个画架让我们饱餐了两天
Hey, that picture frame fed us for two days.

90
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,792
这东西不是意大利面
Yeah, well, this thing is not pasta,

91
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,878
它大得进不了门
and it's too big to fit through the door.

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,764
三个月前 我也是这样
And so was I three months ago.

93
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,265
是真的
No, really.

94
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:23,769
我以前坐飞机都得坐第三排
My seat on an airplane used to be Row Three.

95
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:30,392
就在这街上了
There it is in the street.

96
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:32,561
一个塞满汉堡肉的避孕套?
A condom full of hamburger meat?

97
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,846
天啊
Oh, my God.

98
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:35,898
那是兰博基尼吗?
Is that a Lamborghini?

99
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,116
等等
Wait.

100
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:39,368
那是我的兰博基尼吗?
Is that my Lamborghini?

101
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,906
是的 这是兰博基尼阿文泰德双人敞篷跑车
Yeah, it's a Lamborghini Aventador Roadster.

102
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:45,374
哇
Wow.

103
00:04:45,376 --> 00:04:48,877
监狱的艺术和工艺已经这么棒了
Prison arts and crafts has gotten pretty fancy.

104
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,214
定制这款车要四年
Well, it takes four years for these cars to be custom-made.

105
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:53,916
这一辆是在2011年买的
This one was ordered in 2011.

106
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,634
没错 就在我爹还有钱的时候
That's right, my father ordered this for me

107
00:04:55,636 --> 00:04:57,336
买了这个给我
when he still had money.

108
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,806
纠正 是在他还有别人的钱的时候
Correction: When he had everyone else's money.

109
00:05:00,808 --> 00:05:04,927
我爸爸只给过我一个有问题的染色体
All my father ever gave me was that one iffy chromosome.

110
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,769
这给你
Well, here you go.

111
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:09,305
它是你的了
It's all yours.

112
00:05:09,307 --> 00:05:10,390
我要走回家了
I'm gonna walk home.

113
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:12,442
这是健康的选择
It's all about healthy choices.

114
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:18,531
我有车了!
I got a car!

115
00:05:18,533 --> 00:05:20,783
我们有车了!
We got a car!

116
00:05:30,405 --> 00:05:35,414
该死 有人把这蝙蝠车刷成白的了
Damn, someone painted the Batmobile white.

117
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:39,462
我们还有什么得不到的吗?
Can't we have anything?

118
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:44,994
这是一辆四十五万美元的跑车
That's a $450,000 sports car.

119
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:45,889
我知道
I know.

120
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:48,277
再加个折叠式洗衣烘干机和一辆房车
Add a stackable washer/dryer and a motor home,

121
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:51,295
就像Caroline赢了"展品争夺战"(游戏)
and it's like Caroline won the Showcase Showdown.

122
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:55,406
它能在二点九秒内提速到一百
It goes from 0 to 100 in 2.9 seconds.

123
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:56,417
说到"点"
And speaking of seconds,

124
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:58,062
我正要在"双靴"点些吃的
I'm getting seconds at Two Boots,

125
00:05:58,062 --> 00:06:00,528
那个富婆就结账了
and that rich bitch is paying.

126
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,747
退后 "东京漂移"
Back off, Tokyo Drift.

127
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:09,587
这是我们逃跑的车
This is our getaway car.

128
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,790
我这话的意思是离它远点
And by that, I mean get away from it.

129
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,960
要知道 一旦你把这车开出去了
You know, a car like this depreciates 50%

130
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:18,379
就会贬值一半
the minute you drive it off the lot.

131
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:21,515
所以我才开我的丰田雅力士
That's why I drive my Toyota Yaris.

132
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:24,935
哦啦啦
Ooh la la.

133
00:06:24,937 --> 00:06:28,522
吹牛老爹(歌手)在这儿吗?
Is P. Diddy here?

134
00:06:28,524 --> 00:06:31,264
等等 是泰德・特纳(媒体业巨头)吗?
Wait a minute. Is it Ted Turner?

135
00:06:31,861 --> 00:06:33,611
这不是什么名人的
No one cool owns it.

136
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,112
是Caroline的
It's Caroline's.

137
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,814
现在 这种车会让我
Now, this is the kind of car

138
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:40,317
对任何事情都说同意
that I would say yes to anything in.

139
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,872
除了"更年期音乐"(节目)的票
Anything except tickets to Menopause The Musical.

140
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:49,126
嘿 Caroline 好车啊
Oh, hey, Caroline. Nice car.

141
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:50,995
我一直喜欢你多过喜欢Max
I always liked you more than Max.

142
00:06:50,997 --> 00:06:53,797
你知道的吧 妹子
You know that, right, girl?

143
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:54,625
真的吗?
Really?

144
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,261
因为昨天 我听见你对Max喊
'Cause yesterday, I heard you yell to Max,

145
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:59,345
"Caroline是快要到47还是48岁了吗"
"Is Caroline turning 47 or 48?

146
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:02,982
"因为她表现得像个65岁的人"
"Cause she acts like she's 65."

147
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,955
我是说了
Yeah.

148
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:09,959
因为我想知道在送你的生日卡上要写些什么才好
Yeah, I wanted to know what to write in your birthday card.

149
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:12,294
大家都离车远点
Well, everyone away from the car.

150
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:13,629
我刚跟我爸打完电话
I just got off the phone with my dad.

151
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:15,514
这车明早就要被警察封了
The car is being seized in the morning.

152
00:07:15,516 --> 00:07:17,967
原来是他们不准让我保留自己的生日礼物
Turns out they won't let me keep my present.

153
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:19,185
就像我八岁时的生日
It's just like my eighth birthday

154
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,688
他们硬要我退回父母送的麦考利・库尔金(童星)
when they made me return Macaulay Culkin.

155
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:31,313
他们给你买了个男宠?
They bought you a boy?

156
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,983
你确实曾经富有
You were rich.

157
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:37,403
哎呀 车在眼前 你却不能开
Oh, boy, the car's right here, and you can't even use it.

158
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:40,706
就像我请了你们这两个不干活的服务员
That's like me having you two for waitresses.

159
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,913
Caroline 能帮个忙吗?
Caroline, can I ask you a favor?

160
00:07:47,915 --> 00:07:50,883
你不能用那辆车去向Sophie求婚
You're not using the car to propose to Sophie.

161
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:52,801
你都听到她有多喜欢这车了
You heard how much she liked it.

162
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,387
而且这比我原来的计划更有格调
And it's a little bit classier than my original plan:

163
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,641
原本是在洋克市的烛光宴和斗鸡赛
dinner and a cock fight in Yonkers.

164
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:00,976
我没在刻意偷听
Not that I'm listening,

165
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:05,347
但我不想被人在同性恋酒吧里求婚
but I'm not gonna get proposed to at a gay bar.

166
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,652
现在可好 去同性恋酒吧也没戏了
Great, now my gay bar idea is out also.

167
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:11,270
不可以 Oleg
No, Oleg.

168
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:13,239
我不能把一辆满身划痕的车还回去
I can't return the car with scratches, dents,

169
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,525
或是得了性病的
or chlamydia.

170
00:08:16,527 --> 00:08:18,327
但我们还可以开那车 对吧?
But we can still drive it, right?

171
00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:20,696
我已经涂了一个月的药啦
I mean, I've been on that cream for like a month.

172
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,754
Max 兰博基尼俱乐部规则的第九条是什么
Max, what is the ninth rule of the Lamborghini Club?

173
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:31,423
不得在车上喝红色饮品
No red drinks in the car.

174
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:33,375
我的首要原则是
Here's my number one rule:

175
00:08:33,377 --> 00:08:35,044
要是你逼我睡车上
If you're going to make me sleep in it,

176
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:37,513
我就得在车上喝东西
I am going to drink in it.

177
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:38,881
那就小心点
Well, just be careful.

178
00:08:38,883 --> 00:08:40,382
我只剩一条消毒湿巾了
I only have one Clorox wipe

179
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:42,551
它得用到我下次生日为止
that has to last till my next birthday,

180
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:44,887
况且它都不大湿润了
and it's already lost a lot of its moisture.

181
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:50,059
我不明白为什么要空坐在这
I don't see why we have to just sit here.

182
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:51,227
我们不能开这车
We can't drive it.

183
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,028
我爸说了万一出事
My dad said if anything happens to it,

184
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,230
我们要负责的
we'll be responsible.

185
00:08:54,232 --> 00:08:55,681
哪会发生什么事
What could possibly happen

186
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:59,368
咱可是抽着大麻直通墨西哥
on a weed run to deep Tijuana?

187
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,070
其实我倒希望自己从没有过这车
You know, I wish this car never came,

188
00:09:01,072 --> 00:09:02,788
从未坐上它
and I wish I never sat in it.

189
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,540
这就跟我不去巴尼精品店一个道理
It's the same reason I don't go to Barneys.

190
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:07,159
买不起的东西还是离远点好
I don't like to be around things I can't afford anymore.

191
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,379
也跟我不去一元店是同一个道理
Same reason I don't go to the 99 Cent Store.

192
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,880
那边有套Nerf网球
There's a Nerf tennis set

193
00:09:11,882 --> 00:09:14,133
球拍在地上 球在垃圾桶里
half on the floor, half in the bin,

194
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:17,219
都没被我带回家
none of it going home with me.

195
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:19,972
我本想以积极的心态度过今年的生日
I was trying to be positive about my birthday this year,

196
00:09:19,974 --> 00:09:22,591
要不是我爸东窗事发
but, Max, if things hadn't happened with my father,

197
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:24,810
今晚就会是我的魔幻般的庆生夜
tonight would have been a magical birthday for me.

198
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:26,562
还是有点魔术的
Hey, there was some magic.

199
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:30,482
我就亲自变没了五杯加伏特酒的雪碧
I personally made five vodka Sprites disappear.

200
00:09:30,484 --> 00:09:32,651
厉害吧
Ta-da!

201
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:35,321
我或许已经驾着车 开去汉普顿斯
I would've got in the car and driven out to the Hamptons,

202
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:37,106
还能坐上整晚的沙滩
and we'd sit on the beach all night

203
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:39,275
吃着一个由当地人抓的龙虾
having lobster caught by one of the townies

204
00:09:39,277 --> 00:09:42,444
边喝香槟 边醉醺醺地自拍
and drink champagne while taking duckface selfies

205
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:44,163
直到天亮
till the sun came up.

206
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,918
补充一下 我就是你想象中的那个当地人
FYI, I'm the townie in this scenario,

207
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,037
憎恶着你们所有人
and I hate all of you.

208
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:55,274
现在我却过着最糟糕的生日 和我憧憬的完全不同
Instead of doing any of that, I'm having the worst birthday.

209
00:09:55,276 --> 00:09:56,925
也许黛米・摩尔步入花甲之年
I probably feel worse than Demi Moore did

210
00:09:56,927 --> 00:10:00,129
都没我这么难过
when she turned 50.

211
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:02,681
洗洗睡吧
Yes, just go to sleep.

212
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:05,017
明天起来就会感觉好多了
You'll feel better tomorrow when you wake up.

213
00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:06,769
要是那个拿着把刀说捅死我们的人
I mean, if that guy with the switchblade

214
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,721
没有来杀我们的话
doesn't come back like he promised he would.

215
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:16,812
醒醒 Caroline
Caroline.

216
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:18,030
Caroline 快起来
Caroline, wake up.

217
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,151
我们到沙滩了
We're at the beach.

218
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,788
我载你来到了汉普顿斯
I drove us out to the Hamptons.

219
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,324
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

220
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:32,828
我们在汉普顿斯?
We're in the Hamptons?

221
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,332
我们竟然在汉普顿斯?
We're in the Hamptons?

222
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:38,334
我们怎么来汉普顿斯的?
How are we in the Hamptons?

223
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:40,219
我睡了多久?
How long have I been sleeping?

224
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,004
三四个小时吧
Three hours, give or take.

225
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:44,723
你放了两次屁
You farted twice.

226
00:10:44,725 --> 00:10:46,642
我怎么不会醒来?
How did I not wake up?

227
00:10:46,644 --> 00:10:48,594
是吧 确实很糟糕
I know. It was pretty bad.

228
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:54,650
你放完那个屁后 我还以为我们路过臭蛋乡了
After that last one, I thought we were going through Egg Town.

229
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:58,437
Max 你又做坏事了
Max, you did it again.

230
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,155
你给我下了安眠药 是吧?
You roofied me, didn't you?

231
00:11:00,157 --> 00:11:02,391
自然是有的
Of course I did.

232
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,827
你在那边哭喊着嚷嚷关于汉普顿斯的美梦
You were crying and babbling about the Hamptons,

233
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:07,279
我只能把你放倒啊
so I had to put you down.

234
00:11:07,281 --> 00:11:09,415
你答应过我不会再这么做的
You promised you wouldn't again.

235
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,583
上次我整整昏迷了两天
The last time, I was out for two days.

236
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,036
但我真的想把"权力的游戏"看完啊
Yeah, I really just needed to get through Game of Thrones

237
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:17,289
特别是看乱伦戏时没人吵我
without someone talking during the incest.

238
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,844
你究竟有啥毛病啊?
What is wrong with you?

239
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:24,847
有纸笔吗?
Have you got a pen and paper?

240
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:26,715
你明明知道我不想这么做
You knew I didn't want to do this.

241
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:30,185
你什么事都不想做 所以我替你做了
You never want to do anything, so I did it for you.

242
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:33,639
你开走了一辆价值45万的车
You took a $450,000 car,

243
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:37,059
一辆碰都不该碰的车
a car we're not even supposed to be touching,

244
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,395
还开来汉普顿斯兜风
on a joyride to the Hamptons?

245
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:42,865
是你想来这的
You wanted to be here.

246
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:43,899
现在来了
You are here.

247
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,150
就尽管享受吧
Just enjoy it.

248
00:11:45,152 --> 00:11:48,036
我没心情享受
I can't enjoy it.

249
00:11:49,457 --> 00:11:50,856
Scotty 到桥上来
Scotty to the bridge.

250
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,124
我是科克船长
This is Captain Kirk.

251
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:53,659
斯科迪到桥上来
Scotty to the bridge.

252
00:11:56,747 --> 00:12:00,916
你把车开过沙丘 来这沙滩的?
You drove over the dunes and onto the beach?

253
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:03,051
不是故意的
Not intentionally.

254
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:05,087
我试过刹车 但这车像在对我说
I tried to stop it, but this car was like,

255
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:06,839
冲啊 姑娘
"Mm, no, girl."

256
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:10,893
天啊
Oh, my God.

257
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:13,262
车上有划痕吗?
Did it get any scratches?

258
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:16,982
Max 从车里出来 帮我找找有没划痕
Max, get out of the car, and help me look for scratches.

259
00:12:16,984 --> 00:12:21,403
你说过你来汉普顿斯会开心起来的
You said you were more fun in the Hamptons.

260
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:23,572
才不是这回事
Not true.

261
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:28,610
苏禄先生 开炮 
Mr. Sulu, fire all phasers.

262
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:31,580
没划痕 兰博基尼没事
No scratches. The Lamborghini is fine.

263
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:34,700
多亏了你 我也做了一回租车族
But thanks to you, I'm a Rent-A-Wreck.

264
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,838
行了 该把车开回去了
Come on, we have to get this car back.

265
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,590
会的 真是的 放松点
We will. Jeez, relax.

266
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,791
还有时间呢
We still have time.

267
00:12:42,793 --> 00:12:45,210
听着 你说你想来这
Look, you said you wanted to be here.

268
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:46,845
现在到了 我们别马上走
You're here, and we are not leaving

269
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:48,180
你得先享受下这沙滩
till you do something beach-y,

270
00:12:48,182 --> 00:12:50,182
比如踏踏浪
like walk in the water

271
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:54,720
或者找一下被鲨鱼咬断的残骸
or find a half-eaten lady from Jaws.

272
00:12:54,722 --> 00:12:57,022
没 没门 现在就走
No. No way. Let's go.

273
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:58,273
就试着脱下鞋子嘛
Just take off your shoes or something.

274
00:12:58,275 --> 00:12:59,691
不要
No.

275
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,360
脱下鞋子 感受下沙滩
Just take off your shoes and feel the sand.

276
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:02,611
Max! 住手 Max
Max! Max, stop.

277
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,313
我已经好久没有修过脚了
I haven't had a proper pedicure

278
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:06,615
上一次是在贾斯汀・汀布莱克发单曲之时
since Justin Timberlake released a single.

279
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:09,284
好了 现在可以动动你的脚了
There. Now move your foot around.

280
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:10,619
不要
No.

281
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,538
不 不 不
No. No! No.

282
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,989
啊
Oh. Oh, yeah.

283
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:16,625
感觉好爽
That feels nice.

284
00:13:16,627 --> 00:13:18,627
冰凉的细沙在趾间滑过
The cold sand between my toes.

285
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:20,045
Max 别看我的脚
But, Max, don't look.

286
00:13:20,047 --> 00:13:21,997
中间的指甲简直惨不忍睹
That middle nail's a horror show.

287
00:13:21,999 --> 00:13:23,298
太晚了
Too late.

288
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,503
有那么一会儿 我还觉得它是颗开心果
I thought it was a pistachio for a second.

289
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,305
Max 你有多喜欢海滩
Max, how much do you love the beach?

290
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,424
我不知道 从来没去过
I don't know. I've never been to one.

291
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,293
你从来没去过海滩?
You've never been to a beach?

292
00:13:34,295 --> 00:13:35,894
那又怎么了?
No. What's the point?

293
00:13:35,896 --> 00:13:37,679
我还没有金属探测仪呢
I don't own a metal detector.

294
00:13:40,968 --> 00:13:42,684
好了 时间到
Well, time's up.

295
00:13:42,686 --> 00:13:44,353
可我们才坐下啊
But we just sat down.

296
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,988
我知道 但如果现在走
I know, but if we leave right now,

297
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,990
那我们就还有时间
we'll still have enough time to blow through

298
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,358
掠过麦当劳汽车餐厅
a McDonald's drive-through

299
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,544
就像"回到未来"演的那样
like something from Back to the Future.

300
00:13:52,546 --> 00:13:54,530
我要把咱们的名字写在沙子上
Well, I'm gonna write our names in the sand

301
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,081
很感谢你给我下药
'cause it was a really nice thing

302
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,666
把我绑架到这里
for you to drug me, kidnap me,

303
00:13:57,668 --> 00:14:00,536
然后偷我的车带我到这里
and steal my car to get me out here.

304
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:04,006
朋友嘛
Hey, we're friends.

305
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,174
好了 掉个头先
All right, I'll just turn this baby around.

306
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,280
哦噢
Uh-oh.

307
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,934
哦噢什么呀?
What's "uh-oh"?

308
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:18,770
哦噢什么呀?
What is "uh-oh"?

309
00:14:18,772 --> 00:14:21,106
卡在沙子里了?
Are we stuck in the sand?

310
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:26,061
你这个"哦噢"用得非常到位
You have correctly identified the meaning of "uh-oh."

311
00:14:26,063 --> 00:14:27,896
我们连话都不用说
I love that we don't need full sentences

312
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,399
就能心有灵犀了
to communicate anymore.

313
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,775
再试试
Try it again.

314
00:14:44,396 --> 00:14:45,462
不行
Nope.

315
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:46,311
从运动员家逃出来
I've had less trouble

316
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:48,798
都没这么难
getting out of athlete's apartments.

317
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
那你得下去推车了
Well, you're gonna have to get out and push.

318
00:14:50,702 --> 00:14:52,452
为什么是我?
Why do I have to push?

319
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:55,371
因为是你给我下药 绑架我
Because you're the one who drugged me, kidnapped me,

320
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:56,573
还偷了我的车
and stole my car.

321
00:14:56,575 --> 00:14:57,574
说得好
Exactly.

322
00:14:57,574 --> 00:15:00,994
我都帮你搞定了大部分工作了
I've already done the lion's share of the work.

323
00:15:00,996 --> 00:15:02,912
再说这车是咱俩的
And it's our car.

324
00:15:02,914 --> 00:15:04,380
好吧 我去
Fine, I'll do it.

325
00:15:07,085 --> 00:15:09,385
开门 乌乎拉中尉(星际旅行中"进取号的"总通讯官)
Door's up, Lieutenant Uhura.

326
00:15:09,387 --> 00:15:13,173
都被困在这了 能不贫嘴吗
It stopped being funny when we got stuck.

327
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:14,808
别担心
God, don't worry.

328
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,593
我曾经徒手把一个
I got a 600-pound woman

329
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,478
600磅重的女人从餐厅座位里弄出来
out of a booth at the diner with my bare hands.

330
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,929
我都毫无惧色
I'm fearless.

331
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:24,267
和那次一样 把她挂到空挡
Toss her in neutral like I did with that lady.

332
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,569
沙子和高跟鞋 这样不行啊
Sand and heels. Not a good combo.

333
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:29,272
这样不行啊 不行
Not a good combo. Not a good combo.

334
00:15:29,274 --> 00:15:31,774
没事
Oh, all right.

335
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:34,077
好了
All right.

336
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:34,994
油门踩到底
I'm gonna floor it.

337
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:37,280
等我数到三
On the count of three.

338
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,115
一 二...
One, two...

339
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:51,594
激动了 有点早
I got excited. I went early.

340
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:55,181
要是每次听见这句我能有一美元
If I had a dime for every time I heard that,

341
00:15:55,183 --> 00:15:57,133
我都能买下这车了
I could buy this car.

342
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:58,968
没事 再试一次
All right, let's try again.

343
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,770
一 二...
One, two...

344
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:17,871
这次绝对是故意的
Okay, that was on purpose.

345
00:16:17,873 --> 00:16:20,790
可能吧
A little bit.

346
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,325
真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

347
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:23,993
真不敢相信我居然不信
I can't believe that I can't believe it,

348
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:26,162
可我就是不敢相信
but I really can't believe it.

349
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:27,881
我们遇到这么大的麻烦
We are in very big trouble,

350
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:31,134
还被困在汉普顿的最烂的沙滩上
and we're not even in the good Hamptons.

351
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:33,836
我只是想做点好事
I was trying to do something nice.

352
00:16:33,838 --> 00:16:36,973
第一次 也是最后一次
First time, last time.

353
00:16:36,975 --> 00:16:38,841
你知道你是什么吗?
You know what you are?

354
00:16:38,843 --> 00:16:40,476
你是鲁莽他大爷
You are reckless.

355
00:16:40,478 --> 00:16:42,345
这么长时间
You know, all this time,

356
00:16:42,347 --> 00:16:45,315
我一直以为你是个宝马婊
I thought you were a ride-or-die kind of bitch.

357
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:51,154
我就是个宝马婊怎样
I am a ride-or-die kind of bitch.

358
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:52,939
宝马婊是啥意思?
What's a ride-or-die kind of bitch?

359
00:16:54,409 --> 00:16:58,828
你不会是在谷歌吧?
Are you Googling "ride-or-die kind of bitch"?

360
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:02,532
我倒是想 可只有两格信号
I would be, but I only have two bars.

361
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,202
我们有两条出路:
Look, we have two options:

362
00:17:06,204 --> 00:17:10,173
把车开出去 要么等涨潮了被冲出去
Get the car out of the sand, or let the tide take us.

363
00:17:10,175 --> 00:17:12,175
我把浪潮什么的给标记了
Put a pin in that tide thing,

364
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:14,711
我还挺喜欢那种声音的
'cause I like the sound of it.

365
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,930
再不把车开回去
We barely have enough time to get this car back to the city,

366
00:17:16,932 --> 00:17:19,432
我们要欠上四十五万美元了
or we owe $450,000.

367
00:17:19,434 --> 00:17:23,886
我只有三块 其中两块还是硬币
And I only have $3, and 2 of it's in nickels.

368
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,471
赶紧上车
Now get in the car.

369
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:27,223
你都开始囤硬币了
You're hoarding nickels,

370
00:17:27,225 --> 00:17:31,527
而我却从1元店空手而归?
and I'm walking out of the 99 Cent Store empty-handed?

371
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:34,113
什么日子
Now I'm mad.

372
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:35,898
准备好
Get ready.

373
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,400
你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

374
00:17:37,402 --> 00:17:39,118
把咱们从这弄走
I'm pushing us out of here.

375
00:17:41,156 --> 00:17:45,408
因为我是个宝马婊!
Because I'm a ride-or-die kind of bitch!

376
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,910
也没准
I think.

377
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,213
踩油门!
Now hit it!

378
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:02,675
怎么做到的? 用屁把咱们冲出去?
What'd you do? Fart us out of the ditch?

379
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,596
拜托 Caroline 给点油
Seriously, Caroline, step on it.

380
00:18:06,598 --> 00:18:08,147
不行 Max
No, Max.

381
00:18:08,149 --> 00:18:10,066
万一出事故呢
We can't risk getting into an accident.

382
00:18:10,068 --> 00:18:13,236
万一车没毁人没亡怎么办?
What if it's not fatal?

383
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,439
慢吞吞地开兰博基尼就相当于
Driving a Lamborghini slow is like going to Red Lobster

384
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:19,108
去了红龙虾餐厅却没吃切达小饼
and not getting the Cheddar Bay biscuits.

385
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,444
来吧 趁这机会咱们赶紧享受这车吧
Come on, we got to enjoy this car while we can.

386
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,112
- 踩油门啊  - 好吧
- Hit the gas.  - All right.

387
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:25,498
我会加速到我停止约会的那个年纪
I'll take it up to the top of my age dating window.

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,116
四十
40.

389
00:18:27,118 --> 00:18:29,002
我来帮你加到我自己的限期
And I'll take it to the top of mine.

390
00:18:29,004 --> 00:18:30,286
八十!
80!

391
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:31,587
来吧 
Let go. Have some fun.

392
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:32,872
别 别推我的腿
No, don't push on my leg!

393
00:18:32,874 --> 00:18:34,924
别推我...
Don't push on my...

394
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:38,044
爽! 爽!
Yes! Yes!

395
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,346
有史以来最棒的生日!
Best birthday ever!

396
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:42,181
来点末路狂花的节奏?
Should we Thelma and Louise it?

397
00:18:42,183 --> 00:18:44,300
从悬崖上飞过去?
You mean drive over a cliff?

398
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:47,303
不是 戴着墨镜牵着手啊
No, I mean wear sunglasses and hold hands.

399
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:48,604
他们还飞悬崖了?
They drive over a cliff?

400
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:50,106
我还没看过结局呢
I never saw the end.

401
00:19:00,535 --> 00:19:02,201
姑娘们回来了
There they are.

402
00:19:02,203 --> 00:19:04,487
你们按时把车交回去了?
Did you girls get the car back in time this morning?

403
00:19:04,489 --> 00:19:06,873
正好赶上 得感谢Caroline
Yep, just in time, thanks to Caroline.

404
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,708
一路无视限速牌
She was ignoring speed limit signs

405
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,045
还有那些流浪汉
like she does homeless people.

406
00:19:12,047 --> 00:19:13,546
有个警察说我这车开的
A state trooper called my driving

407
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:16,165
简直是过失杀人
criminally negligent.

408
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,384
我真是自豪
I was so proud.

409
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,836
我差点就发火了
I might've even gotten emotional,

410
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:21,504
但是还要说服他们别开罚单
but I had to talk our way out of the ticket,

411
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,506
虽然没穿制服 但还是要专业一点
and I like to be professional when my shirt's off.

412
00:19:25,343 --> 00:19:27,060
你们居然没吃罚单?
You didn't get a ticket?

413
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:31,147
昨天我光是走进健康食品超市都被抓了
Yesterday, I got arrested for just walking into Whole Foods.

414
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,850
我头发里还有沙子
I can't believe I still have sand in my hair.

415
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:35,985
你要是只有头发里有沙子
If the only place you still have sand is in your hair,

416
00:19:35,987 --> 00:19:37,437
那真是走运
you're lucky.

417
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:40,523
我下面就差吐出来个珍珠了
I'm about to make a pearl down there.

418
00:19:42,527 --> 00:19:45,244
你们好啊 穷芭比娃娃们
Oh, hey, there, destitute Barbie.

419
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:49,165
很遗憾你们失去了那辆车
Sorry you lost the dream car.

420
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,751
我还是坐我的专座吧
Anyway, I'll be in my booth.

421
00:19:51,753 --> 00:19:57,173
Sophie 宝贝
Sophie, beautiful baby...

422
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,425
我已经确定了我的求婚地点
I've narrowed down the site of my proposal

423
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,943
必须符合三个条件
to three options:

424
00:20:00,945 --> 00:20:03,229
第一 我们相遇的地方...
A, the place we met...

425
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:07,266
第二 我们经常爱爱的地方...
B, the place we've had sex most often...

426
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:11,104
第三 我们最近一次爱爱的地方...
or C, the place we've had sex most recently.

427
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:15,391
等等 等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

428
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:19,479
这不就是我的专座吗!
All three of those places are this booth!

429
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,866
没错
That's right.

430
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:25,785
Sophie Kachinsky啊...
Sophie Kachinsky...

431
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,987
他在餐厅求婚?
He's proposing at the diner?

432
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:31,324
怎么着? 送个洋葱圈当戒指?
What's he gonna do? Put an onion ring on it?

433
00:20:35,747 --> 00:20:38,080
天...
Oh...

434
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:41,000
我真喜欢
I love that.

435
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:49,258
我本来打算拒绝
You know, I was planning on saying no

436
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,396
然后让你求我几个小时 但是...
and making you beg for a few hours, but...

437
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:55,765
我也好爱你
I just love you too much.

438
00:21:00,438 --> 00:21:05,358
和平常的恶心情节不一样啊
Aw, that's so not as gross as normal.

439
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,166
现在一样了
Now it is.
