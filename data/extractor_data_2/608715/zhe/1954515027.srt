00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,080

飞天大盗 第2季第5集
S02E05 Old Acquaintance

13
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,960
怎样?
So?

14
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,810
赌场的计划先放一边
The casino score's on hold.

15
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,770
我们找到了新目标
We've got ourselves a new mark.

16
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,600
- 谁? - Jake Henry
- Who? - Jake Henry.

17
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,760
我丈夫
My husband.

18
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,240
五年前他
He walked out on me five years ago...

19
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,200
把我所有的一切都带走了
with pretty much everything I owned.

20
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,280
所有?
Everything?

21
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,880
把我重要的东西都带走了 只给我留下一些感触的东西
Apart from a few thoughtful touches,he took all the things that mattered to me.

22
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,880
- 连我的屋都拿走了 - 人渣
- Even my home. - Bastard.

23
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,330
他给我留下一张Phil Collins的CD 那倒不是我的
He left me a Phil Collins CD that wasn't even mine.

24
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,920
- 变态的人渣 - 我要说的是 这是个报复的机会
- Twisted bastard. - The point is,it's payback time.

25
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,440
那我们有什么消息?
So what do we know?

26
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,640
- Ash? - 我现在还不是很清楚
- Ash? - Well,I haven't had that much time.

27
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,850
我只知道他刚从Amsterdam过来 这边住几个星期
But I have found out he's only in town from Amsterdam for a few days...

28
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,440
来玩玩牌,德州扑克
to play poker.Texas hold 'em.

29
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,880
他今晚在赌场还有另外一场赌局
And he's got another game at the casino tonight.

30
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,690
他是在玩玩还是在骗人?
He playing for real or pulling a con?

31
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,400
- Jake这样的人很可能是在骗人 - 的确 应该是这样
- Probably the latter,knowing Jake. - Well,it looked like it was for real.

32
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,240
据说他是最好的几个老千
And word is he's one of the best.

33
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,480
现在还是吗?
Is he,now?

34
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,680
- 他在哪住? - Aylesham酒店
- Where's he staying? - The Aylesham.

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,690
那他要不是很有钱 要么就是他 根本没打算给钱罗
So either he's worth a few quid or he's planning not to pay.

36
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,800
那我们怎么办?
What's our in?

37
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,400
我们得快一点动手 所以还是用赌牌吧
We'll have to move fast,so it'll have to be the poker.

38
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,130
根据之前的表现 Danny能继续当我们的无助酒鬼
Going on previous performances,Danny can play our hopeless drunk...

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,280
- 没多大问题 - 是吗?谢谢
- without too much difficulty. - Yeah?Thank you.

40
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,280
你得知道 要做好那酒鬼
I'll have you know it does take a lot of hard work and dedication...

41
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,520
还得花很多功夫跟努力喔
to be that convincing.

42
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,490
我们说服Jake来赌一场德州扑克
So we'll convince Jake to join us in a holdem competition.

43
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,880
- 我们还要知道什么? - 如果有人拥有Jake想要的东西
- Anything else we should know? - lf someone's got something Jake wants...

44
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,850
他就会不惜一切的把它骗到手
he'll do whatever he can to take it off them.

45
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,490
我们就迎合他这性格好了
So we'll rekindle his desire for something.

46
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,680
这样的话 Stacie你是鱼饵
In this case,Stacie.

47
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,080
你别这么轻易跟他走了喔
You watch he don't get carried away.

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,050
好了 跟昨晚一样
Okay,same routine as last night.

49
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,560
Albert 你去牵引一下 Stacie跟我等你的消息
Albert,you'll rope.Stacie and I will wait for the signal.

50
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,200
Danny你还做那酒鬼 Ash 周围走走 看还有什么信息
Danny,as you were.Ash,dig around,see what else you can find out.

51
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,760
好 好了 你们都有些好玩的事干
Yeah,that's right.You lot do the glamorous stuff...

52
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,680
我就做这无足轻重的事 干嘛你不去?
and leave me to do the serious graft,why don't you?

53
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,170
我们开始吧
Let's get started.

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,370
Stace 我能跟你谈谈吧?
Stace,can I have a word?

55
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,960
- 能啊 - 听着
- Yeah. - Look...

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,240
我知道你可能也不想这样
I understand if you don't want to do this...

57
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,360
但只有你最了解他
but you know him better than anybody else.

58
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,120
我还得了解一下他
I just need a bit more going.

59
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,370

68
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,170
- 我不记得你的名字 - 因为我没给过你
- I didn't catch your name,mate. - I didn't give it out.

69
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,000
我以前没见过你吧?
I've not seen you round here before,have I?

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,640
应该没有 我昨天刚到
Unlikely.I only arrived here yesterday.

71
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,520
这是Jake Henry 他是个赌牌好手 他很忙的
This is Jake Henry.And he's an excellent poker player and a very busy man.

72
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,610
- 今晚玩的好吧 Jake? - 蛮好
- Having a good night,are you,Jake? - I was.

73
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,680
就像我说的 Henry先生是个大忙人
Like I said,Mr.Henry is a very busy man.

74
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,760
好的 迟些见 Jack
All right,whatever.Anyway,catch you later,Jack.

75
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,650
迟些见 Benny 明晚 别忘了
I'll see you later,Benny.Tomorrow night,don't forget.

76
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,720
我就知道你爱忘事
I know what you're like,Mr.Forgetful.

77
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,920
麻烦人 千万别告诉他什么
Nightmare.Don't tell him anything.

78
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,200
好的 我的心肝
All right,sweetheart?

79
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,480
怎么想也不会把你们两联系到一起
I wouldn't have thought you and he moved in the same circles.

80
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,370
我们没关系的 我只是认识他父亲
Oh,we don't.I know his father...

81
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,120
或者说跟他爸在高尔夫球场上见过几次面
or rather,made his acquaintance at a golf charity function.

82
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,850
他很无聊的 可就是有钱 所以认识一下也无防
He's a terrible bore,but a billionaire,and therefore useful to know.

83
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,480
他儿子就老是以为自己是赌牌高手
His son thinks he's one of the hotshots on the poker circuit.

84
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,450
老喜欢跟最好的高手玩
He's always trying to mingle with the best players.

85
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,000
如果赌牌的以为自己能赢所有高手
If the joker's dumb enough to think he can beat the best players...

86
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,920
那他就活该输的精光
he deserves to lose every penny he's got.

87
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,360
常输的也会有时赢的
Although the joker could turn out to be the ace in the pack.

88
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,000
Richie Blake
Richie Blake.

89
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,680
对他老爸来说
Richard to his father...

90
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,490
- 就象Dick对于别人一样 - 派牌
- Dick to anyone else. - Hit me.

91
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,720
好多年了 都是他老爸给钱他赌
His dad has been funding his son's gambling for years.

92
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,530
现在他也受够了
He's finally had enough.

93
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,330
上星期他告诉我
He confided in me last week...

94
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,280
再帮他一次他就不帮了
the next time he helps his wastrel of a son will be the last.

95
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,650
他每次吹牛 他都有个小动作
Now,when Richie's bluffing,he's got a tell that no one else seems to have spotted.

96
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,360
他都会稍微动一下
He does a little variation each time.

97
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,400
人家都以为是因为他喝醉了
People think it's because he's drunk.

98
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,360
我告诉你这些 你觉得奇怪吧?
Are you wondering why I'm telling you all this?

99
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,040
我是这么想的
The thought had crossed my mind,yeah.

100
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,720
我明天会搞个赌局 赢家拿钱
Well,I'm getting up a little competition tomorrow evening,winner take all.

101
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,880
要25000美金才可以参加 我做庄
25,000 sit-down money.I'll be the dealer.

102
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,440
Chip Lacey跟我说起过
Chip Lacey mentioned something about it.

103
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,720
对的 他也参加 还有Snake Eyes
Yeah,he's in,and Snake Eyes,too.

104
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:05,120
我不得不找他们 因为这样Richie才会感兴趣
But,you see,I had to get them in,otherwise Richie wouldn't be interested.

105
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,880
我本再多搞几次
I could have done with more time...

106
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:10,090
但他老爸说了 这是最后一次资助他赌牌
but his father told me it'll be the last drop he gives to Richie.

107
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:13,760
所以我得快点找到些好牌手
So I had to find a good player,and fast.

108
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,080
你们赌场去死吧
Stick your casino up your ass.

109
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,650
那 你想怎么样?
So,what are you saying?

110
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,520
我想请你也参加
I want to get you in the game.

111
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,080
我出一半的赌金
I'll put in half of the 25,000 sit-down money.

112
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,320
你出另外一半 你赢了钱分给我10%
You put in the other half,then give me 10% of your winnings...

113
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,450
其他就是你的了
and you get to keep everything else.

114
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,880
- 我输了呢? - 你不会的
- What if I lose? - Well,you won't.

115
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,850
第一因为你是很厉害的牌手
A:because you're an exceptional player...

116
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,160
第二因为你会有我
and B:because you've got a sure-fire tell...

117
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,170
来帮你
courtesy of me.

118
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,290
那怎么不找Snake Eyes跟Lacey?
Why not bring Snake Eyes or Lacey in on this with you?

119
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,800
他们是不错
They're good...

120
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,850
但从今晚看来 你更厉害
but from what I saw this evening,you're even better.

121
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,450
计划的不错 但是 我不想去
Nice plan,but no,thanks.

122
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,280
改变了主意就给我电话
In case you change your mind.

123
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,520
好吧?
Right?

124
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:08,520
应该不会了 我明天飞回荷兰了 谢谢你 Ben
I doubt it.I'm flying home to Holland tomorrow.Thank you anyway,Ben.

125
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,840

128
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,810
你在这干吗?
What are you doing here?

129
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,360
该我问你吧?
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

130
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,800
- 你还单身 还是...? - 她不是单身
- Are you alone,or are you with... - No.

131
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,690
她跟我一起了
She's with me.

132
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,570
Mickey Stone
Well,well.Mickey Stone.

133
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,610
我听说你死了
I heard you were dead.

134
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,330
想的美
Wishful thinking.

135
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,520
怎么了 Mickey仔 你开始开赌场了?
So what's the story,Mickey-boy?You pulling casinos now?

136
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,760
不是 我过来玩牌
No,I was here to play poker.

137
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,010
- 希望你牌艺好了些 - 是好了些
- I hope your game's improved. - It has.

138
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,040
那你小赌小骗的生意怎么样Jake?
So how are things in the small- con world,Jake?

139
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,720
还在骗些小钱吧?
Still taking ?0 scores?

140
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,320
我不知道喔 我早不玩那些了
I wouldn't know.Some of us managed to get out a long time ago.

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,050
但你还占着些不属于你的东西吧
And some of us got out with something that didn't belong to them.

142
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:30,880
算了Mickey 不要跟这些人再说了
Leave it,Mickey.He's really not worth it.

143
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,320
真的算了?他这么对你
Are you serious,after what he did to you?

144
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,640
我们不是活的蛮好的吗?
I think I came out of it pretty well,considering.

145
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,800
Albert 他上钓了
Albert,he's on the hook.

146
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,120
好的
Good.

147
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,200
- 他会来的 - 好
- He's gone for it. - Nice one.

148
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,970
快点快点
Come on,come on.

149
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,930
我对这一窍不通
That is all double Dutch to me.

150
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,480
好了 开始
Come on,come....We're in.

151
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,040
- 忘带钥匙了? - Stacie
- Forgotten your key? - Hello,Stacie.

152
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,730
再见Jake
Goodbye,Jake.

153
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,120
我来道歉的
I've come to apologize.

154
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,200
- 这道歉晚了5年 - 求你了
- You're five years too late. - Please.

155
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,280
我想该陪你一下
I thought I'd keep you company...

156
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,010
我见到你跟Micky吵架
seeing as though it looks like Mickey's neglecting you.

157
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,760
- 他很快会回来的 - 我不会谈很久的
- He'll be back soon. - It won't take long.

158
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,450
这里风景很好啊
Lovely view.

159
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,680
日子过的挺好吧
You've done well for yourself.

160
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,560
搬来这多久了?
How long you had this place?

161
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,280
我们要去展示单位
The show apartment,please.

162
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,370
好几年了
Couple of years.

163
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,850
看你这身行头 看来我的钱在你 手上也真是用得其所
Nice to see at least my money went on a decent suit.

164
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,640
我还以为婚礼宣誓上你说的是
Although I don't recall the marriage vows saying:

165
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,560
"爱与忠诚
"Love,honor...

166
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,200
"并带走你老婆的所有积蓄"
"and do a runner with your wife's savings."

167
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,760
我做错了 我该罚
Okay.I deserved that.

168
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,600
当然
And that.

169
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,920
他一直在Amsterdam干吗?
So what's he been up to in Amsterdam all this time?

170
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,240
这样说吧 他在那也不是一帆风顺的
Well,put it this way,he hasn't exactly been tiptoeing through the tulips.

171
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,440
他在那开始了赌牌
He made a mint on the poker circuit out there...

172
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,410
好像也没再行骗
and it looks like he's given up grifting.

173
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,370
搞不清有没有
Couldn't take the pace.

174
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,320
这就是我为什么离开
This is why I had to leave.

175
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,690
我赌钱输了 欠Davey Canning很多钱
I owed Davey Canning a lot of money in a poker game.

176
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,000
很多
A lot of money.

177
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,680
我不还他钱 他就给我这
This was a little taste of what was to come if I didn't get him his money.

178
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,570
- 硫酸? - 算好了
- Acid? - I was lucky.

179
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,720
本来要倒到我脸上的
It was meant for my face.

180
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,240
我筹不起钱
I couldn't get all the cash together...

181
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,800
卖了你的房子也不够
not even after selling the house.

182
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,290
我当时好绝望
I was desperate.

183
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,440
打个电话也好啊
A phone call would have been nice.

184
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,450
- 就算是张明信片也好啊 - 我不能啊
- A postcard,even. - I couldn't call you.

185
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,570
怎么能把你扯进来呢?
I couldn't get you involved in the mess.Would have been dangerous for you.

186
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,170
那晚真不敢相信能在赌场见到你
I couldn't believe it,seeing you in the casino tonight.

187
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,600
那是上天注定的?
Must be fate,eh?

188
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,680
是我霉气
Or seriously bad karma.

189
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:02,890
你想Stacie会不会又回到他身边?
You don't think Stacie would fall for him again?

190
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,960
他曾经爱过她
He once had quite a hold on her.

191
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,040
我打过给她 没接
Once bitten....

192
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,720
我没给你打电话
Just because I couldn't call you...

193
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,400
不是说我就不想你了
didn't mean that I stopped thinking about you.

194
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,290
你的(戒指)在那?
Where's yours?

195
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,450
泰晤士河下面
Bottom of the Thames.

196
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,280
好的
Nice.

197
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,880
那你希望我现在在哪?
That where you wish I was right now?

198
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,600
我不知道你会看穿我
I didn't know you could mind-read.

199
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,720
你恨我 我不怪你
I don't blame you for hating me.

200
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,690
你不接吗?
Aren't you going to get that?

201
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,400
让他等等
It can wait.

202
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,320
- 又没接? - 不是
- Twice bitten? - No.

203
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,730
不是打给Stacie 她应该没什么问题的
Not Stacie.I'm sure she's playing it fine.

204
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,800
我想再跟你一起
I'm asking for a second chance.

205
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,760
你还是那么爱开玩笑啊
Good to see your jokes are as warped as ever.

206
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,520
我还爱你
I still love you,Stace.

207
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,520
真好笑
Really warped.

208
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,890
我不是开玩笑
I'm not joking.

209
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,240
我们一起很好的啊 你也知道的了
We're good together,you know we are.

210
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,800
那是好久前的了
That was a long time ago.

211
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,560
我不逼你
Doesn't have to be.

212
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,640
我知道Mickey不适合你
I know Mickey's not right for you.

213
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,920
怎么说?
How?

214
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,250
因为
Because....

215
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,290
你吻我的时候就跟吻他不一样
You wouldn't have kissed me like that if he was.

216
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,440
你是时候走了Jake
I think it was time you were going,Jake.

217
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,440
我想代表我的客户和你碰个面

218
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,440
碰个面

219
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,440
我有个财产要买.买...

220
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,440
对不起,是卖

221
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,930
知道Stacie对Jake值多少钱吗?
Any idea how much Jake took Stacie for,Mick?

222
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,840
25,000
25,000.

223
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,450
- 那 我们骗他上钩了吗? - 好像是
- So,do we have him? - Looks like it.

224
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,520
你还好吧?
You okay?

225
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,920
还是你见到Jake之后 就一直心不在焉?
Or are you sick of being asked that since Jake showed his face?

226
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,280
第一个问题 好 第二个问题 不是
"Yes" to both those questions.

227
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,720
我不知道该不该让你做
I'm not sure if I'd have the bottle to do what you're doing.

228
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,960
- 什么意思? - 我们找条鱼儿
- How do you mean? - Well,trying to take out a mark...

229
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,440
却非要找上你前夫
when the mark just happens to be your ex.

230
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,720
事情发展得 可能会一团糟
Things can get,you know,a bit messy.

231
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,960
感情会胜过理智
Old feelings come to the surface,all that,you know.

232
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,120
我对他没感情了
Except I don't have any feelings for Jake.

233
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,810
你这么忙也肯见我
Good of you to fit me into your busy schedule.

234
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,960
- 5分钟 - 好的
- Five minutes. - Certainly,sir.

235
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,450
不会太久的 你想怎样?
I haven't got long,Jake.What do you want?

236
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,200
过的蛮不错吧
Done well for yourself,Mick.

237
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,200
还算可以
Can't take all the credit.

238
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,850
没Stacie我也没有今天
Wouldn't have got where I am today without Stacie.

239
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,890
你跟Stace还没到那份上 是吧?
Mind you,you haven't quite got all the trappings,have you?

240
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,570
她现在还没跟你结婚吧
You and Stace still not hitched yet.

241
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,090
那是为什么呢 她不想跟你?
What's the story with that?You got cold feet?

242
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,690
我们一直没找着你去签离婚协议
You haven't exactly made it easy for us to find you,to get the divorce papers.

243
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,650
可能Stacie不想离婚
Perhaps Stacie doesn't want a divorce.

244
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,690
我得说 她还不是很想嫁你
I must admit,she didn't sound so keen on the idea of marrying you.

245
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,250
你又怎么知道?
And how the hell would you know?

246
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,370
她还没告诉你 我昨晚去她屋了吧?
She didn't tell you I was in your apartment last night?

247
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,610
你该走了吧
I think you've outstayed your welcome.

248
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,250
我还没说我想干嘛呢...
You haven't heard my proposition yet.

249
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,680
我不关心
Not sure I'm interested.

250
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,520
我想你会关心的
I think you might be.

251
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,880
- 我再给你一次机会 - 什么机会?
- I'm gonna give you a second chance. - Second chance at what?

252
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,490
今晚有场赌局 赢家拿钱
There's a big poker game tonight.Winner takes all.

253
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,210
就几个人参加
A few other players involved.

254
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:31,410
我想再给你一次机会 看你能不能打败我
I thought you might like another chance at trying to beat me after all these years.

255
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,640
为什么你觉得我会有兴趣?
What makes you think I care?

256
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,170
有个叫Ben Morgan的搞的赌局 他会做庄
Guy called Ben Morgan set it up.He's gonna be the dealer.

257
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,290
25000的赌金
25,000 gets you a place at the table.

258
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,010
我干吗要跟一个你介绍的庄家赌?
Why would I play in a game with a dealer of your choice?

259
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,240
你以为我会骗你啊?
You think I'm gonna try and cheat you?

260
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,400
- 一次不忠 百次不用 - Mickey 我不需要骗你
- Once a grifter,always a grifter. - No,Mickey.I don't need to cheat you.

261
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,890
我用这
I use this.

262
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,080
你以为你能把人骗倒
You think you're smarter than the next man...

263
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,610
因为你比他聪明 比他厉害
that you can outplay him,that you can outwit him...

264
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,490
但事实上是
but the truth of the matter is...

265
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,240
你还是要输给我
you're still a two-bit loser...

266
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,370
骗一两个笨人去得到你想要的
pulling cons on stupid marks to get what you want.

267
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:06,280
- 我就不会这样做 - 我倒没有骗Stacie
- I'm out of that game. - I didn't have to con Stacie.

268
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,730
是的
True.

269
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,040
只是当初我没在的 所以根本没人跟你比
Then again,I wasn't around,so there wasn't any competition.

270
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,730
你现在就想来抢了?想的美吧
And the competition's back now?You flatter yourself,Jake.

271
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,930
在Stacie这事上你赢不了我
You just can't handle me being around Stacie.

272
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,010
没关系 你回心转意的时候 给我打个电话
No problem.You give me a call when you get your bottle back.

273
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,890
如果要这样才能让你死心 那好 算我一份
If that's what it takes to get rid of you,then yes,you count me in.

274
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:42,120
我是Ben Morgan
Ben Morgan.

275
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,080
Jake!
Jake!

276
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,320
不 不 还不算太迟
No,no!It's not too late,no.

277
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,370
好的 到时见
Okay.Let's meet.

278
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,090
鱼儿上钩了
We're on.

279
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,330
好了 就赌德州扑克 我们都会玩吧?
Okay,holdem it is.Are we all clear on the rules?

280
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,760
不会的可要注意了
I hope you're paying attention.

281
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,530
谢谢
Thank you.

282
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,600
游戏开始 每个玩家有两张牌 面朝下
At the start of the game,every player gets two cards,face down.

283
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,090
之后是跳牌
Then comes the flop.

284
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,360
再开三张
Burn one,place three up.

285
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,850
现在你要下注
At each stage,you place a bet to stay in the game.

286
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,530
之后 要么开牌 要么再跳一张
Next,the turn card,or fourth street.

287
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,810
开最后一张
Then the river.

288
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,800
游戏玩法是
Now,the idea is:

289
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,240
在你手上的牌跟台面上的牌里
between the cards you've got in your hand and the cards on the table...

290
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,640
选最好的5张做一手
you make the best five-card poker hand.

291
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,040
好玩就在于
Tricky thing is:

292
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,840
你不知道其他人的两张牌是什么
you've no idea of knowing what two cards every other player has.

293
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,960
你会说你手上的是最好的牌
So you bet that you've got the best hand...

294
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:04,890
你下注之后 别的玩家会跟
and once you bet,the other player has to put in the same amount...

295
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:06,880
大你 或者不跟
raise,or fold.

296
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,480
当然 如果你觉得你手上的是最好的牌
Of course,if you think you've got the best hand....

297
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,530
那全下好了
All in.

298
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,520
别急嘛 这么猛
Easy,tiger.

299
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,290
我全下了因为我觉得他在吹牛
I've gone all in because I believe he's bluffing.

300
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,050
他没好牌的 我倒是有一对Q
He's got a nothing hand,whereas I have pocket queens...

301
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,810
再加上台面上的Q 我就有三张Q
and with the queen in the flop,that makes three of a kind.

302
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,650
他以为我吹牛皮
He thinks I'm bluffing...

303
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,640
但是 我早就把他看穿了
but listen,I can read this kid like a book.

304
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,730
幸亏的是 我还有一对10 不太坏
Good thing is,I got pocket 10s.Which is not bad at all.

305
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,360
我肯定能赢的
I'm sure I've got him beat.

306
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,960
如果 他输了
Now,if he loses....

307
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,000
他输了 他就出局了 因为他手上没钱了
Now,if he loses this,he's out,'cause he's put all his chips in.

308
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,970
他不只输了这一手 他没得玩了
He ain't just lost the hand,he's lost the whole goddamn game.

309
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,090
所以我就赢了
So I win.

310
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,370
你要跟还是不跟啊?
You going to play the hand or not?

311
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,250
好吊啊 不是吗?好我跟
Touchy sod,isn't he?Right,I'll call.

312
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,090
- 他在吹牛皮 - 他在吹牛皮
- He's bluffing. - He's bluffing.

313
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:11,560
3个Q
Three queens...

314
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,730
赢了一对10
beats a pair of 10s.

315
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:26,770
就是这样 我会配合你骗倒他的
Here's the deal.I'm gonna come in on this con with you.

316
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,810
骗他?这样说太不客气了吧?
Con?But isn't that rather ungentlemanly?

317
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,720
不如说是一次机会
I'd like to think of it as an opportunity.

318
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,050
我会抓紧这次机会
I've decided to use this "opportunity"...

319
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,010
我会带个人上来
to bring someone else into the competition tonight.

320
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,320
Mickey Stone
Mickey Stone.

321
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,520
谁是Mickey Stone?
And who is Mickey Stone?

322
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,920
这人有我想要的东西
Someone who's got something that I want.

323
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,970
越多人就赢越多罗
The more players in the game,the more money in the pot.

324
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,800
- 对我跟你来说还不是更好 - 对啊
- All the better for you and me. - Exactly.

325
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,880
我就关心这 钱越多就越好
Which is why I'm only interested if we make the pot bigger.

326
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,490
- 多少? - 50000
- How much? - 50,000 sit-down.

327
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,370
50000?
50,000?

328
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,960
我倒想看看其他人能凑够这钱吗
I'll have to see if the other players can come up with that in time.

329
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,370
怎样?
Well?

330
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,370
- 你跟我的一起 100000 - 加上Ben Morgan一份 25000
- Yours and my stake,that's 100,000. - Plus Ben Morgan's stake,25,000.

331
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,690
我们全副身家放进去了
We've already put all our reserve capital into this.

332
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,920
- 没有啊 还有我的养老金呢 - 不是把Albie 开玩笑吧
- Not quite.There's my pension fund. - No,Albie,don't even think about it.

333
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,080
这次是为了你 记住了吗?你最好放醒目点
This one was for you,remember?I mean,you're worth every penny,my dear.

334
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:31,240
这是我准备六月的医保的钱
And there's the money I set aside for June's hospital bills.

335
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,560
你不能这样做
You can't do that,Ash.

336
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,290
我想我们会赢回来的
I can if I think I'll get it back,which I know we will.

337
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,720
就靠你了Stace
Think of the returns,Stace.

338
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,090
但是我们输的话 我们就全都没了
Yeah,but if we lose,we lose everything we've got.

339
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,810
我们不会输的
We won't lose.

340
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,650
如果Albert能说服
So,if Albert can convince Snake Eyes and Chip Lacey...

341
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,800
每人带上35000来赌局
to come up with an extra 35,000 each for a place at the table....

342
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:49,610
- 那没问题了 - 我们还差
- Already done. - Then we need to find....

343
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:53,410
算上我们手头上的 我们还差20000
With what we've got so far,we're still short by 20,000.

344
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,610
只有3个小时了
Three hours to find it.

345
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,800
我要来领我老板的狗的 他老婆今早带过来的
I'm coming in to collect my boss' dog.His wife brought her in this morning.

346
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,850
对了 就是他
Yeah,that's her.

347
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,000

Mitzi.

348
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,240
我待会过来拿
I'll be around to collect her shortly.

349
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,960
好的 待会见 谢谢 再见
Okay,yeah.I'll see you soon.Thank you ever so much.Bye.

350
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,520
- 时间好紧喔 - 你不是喜欢挑战吗
- This is going to be tight. - I thought you liked a challenge.

351
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,080
对啊 我还喜欢Cameron Diaz呢
Yeah,I do.I like Cameron Diaz as well.

352
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:26,530
但是我没机会啊 知道吗?
Don't mean I stand a chance of copping off with her,does it?

353
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:30,160
- 告诉你 我不知道 - 来啊 美女
- Mind you,I don't know. - Come on,beautiful.

354
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,370
来了
Here you go.

355
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:50,970
好的 谢谢罗
All right,thanks a lot.

356
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,250
真是巧夺天工啊
They're all divine.

357
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:48,800
慢慢挑选
Please take as long as you need to decide.

358
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,050
要先看一下这吗
Perhaps you'd like to have a look at these.

359
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,200
很不巧 我们没时间了
Unfortunately,time is of the essence.We do have a plane to catch.

360
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,960
我只是决定不了
I just can't make up my mind,darling.

361
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,170
快拉 就给你30秒
Pumpkin,you have 30 seconds.

362
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,400
我们要到Harrods去买婴儿床跟婴儿椅
We have to go to Harrods and get the playpen and the crib.

363
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,130
我要这
I'll have this one.

364
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,850
还是这呢?
Or this one?

365
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,130
好的 就那样拉 走了 我们得走了
Okay,that's it.Come on.We have to go.

366
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,800
- 来了 对不起 - 亲爱的
- Come on,I'm sorry. - Sweetie?

367
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,880
你服务很周到 谢谢
You've been most helpful,thank you very much.

368
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,720
- 好拉 我两分钟就好了 - 我说过30秒
- Look,I'll be two minutes. - No,I said 30 seconds.

369
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:20,800
- 不要急着买啊 - 好了 我们可以再回来的
- You can't hurry a decision like that. - Yeah,well,maybe we'll come back.

370
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,010
我保证
I promise,darling.

371
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,080
- 我这次会定下来的 - 好的
- I'll decide this time. - Okay.

372
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,050
不是吧 你说你已经定下了
Come on,you said you'd made up your mind.

373
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,440
要不要也试试这?
Perhaps madam would like to try one on?

374
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:57,170
我就知道你不该那么紧张的
I knew you should have been taking it easy.

375
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,290
好了 我没事
No.I'm fine.

376
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,160
- Mitzi 照看好他喔 - 好了Mitzi好了 没事
- Mitzi.Be careful with her. - All right,Mitzi,all right,baby.

377
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,450
- 对不起 - 不要动
- Sorry. - Stay.

378
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:08,400
- 怎么样? - 没事 我出去呼吸一点新鲜空气
- How you feeling? - I'm fine,I just need some air.

379
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,920
好的 你就在车上等吧
Okay,then you can wait in the car.

380
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:12,400
- 好了 我们走吧 - 但我的
- Here we go.Come on. - But my....

381
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,130
这天够忙的
It's been a heavy day.

382
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,610
- Mitzi! - 我来照看它
- Mitzi! - I'll take care of the dog.

383
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:19,050
你能陪她上车吗?谢谢
Would you mind just escorting her to the car?Thank you.

384
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,440
对不起 浪费了你的时间
I am so sorry to have wasted your time.

385
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,730
可能我们下次来伦敦时候会再过来的
Maybe we'll try to come back when we're next in London.

386
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,400
我能给点意见吗
If it helps...

387
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,610
我觉得你夫人会比较喜欢这个
I believe your wife was about to opt for this one.

388
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,240
你觉得吧?
You think?

389
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,250
要是你错了的话我可花费不起喔
Could be a very expensive mistake if you're wrong.

390
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:38,720
这样吧 何不让我去问一下她?
Tell you what,why don't I go and ask her?

391
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,170
很快的 好吗?
Shouldn't take a second.Yeah?

392
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,490
当然没问题
Of course,sir.

393
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,160
很快回来
I'll be a second.

394
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,050
- 就说我们能凑到 - 好了 游戏开始了
- Told you we'd do it. - Okay,game on.

395
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:18,330
第一步
Stage one:

396
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:22,040
我们要让其他两个参加的人先退出
we need to take the other two players out of the competition first.

397
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,450
他们可是不情愿离开的
They won't want to leave the table.

398
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,130
这么轻易就走的话 他们的钱就化汤了
If they leave before the game is over,they forfeit their chips...

399
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,360
所以动动手脚
so they'll need a push.

400
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,520
Danny 你搞定Snake Eyes?
Danny,you're taking care of Snake Eyes?

401
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,080
好的 我跟Eddie 会搞定的
Yeah,me and Eddie got a little something sorted.

402
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,920
我们会让他分身不下的
Let's just say his mind will be on more pressing matters.

403
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,650
好的 Ash 你搞定Chip Lacey?
Okay.Ash,Chip Lacey?

404
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,850
好的 都准备好了 他就等着来点惊喜吧
Yeah,everything's in place.He's in for a small surprise.

405
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,770
之后我们就进行第二步计划 假的小动作
Good.Then we move on to stage two:the false tell.

406
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,360
那会是什么?
What is the tell?

407
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,960
- 天啊 - 告诉我他不是说真的
- Oh,God! - Please tell me he's not serious.

408
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,640
不关我事
Nothing to do with me.

409
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,450
我是大智若愚吧
I thought it was bordering on genius,myself.

410
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,810
大智若愚 那动动脑子
Well,think of something else,genius.

411
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,320
那应该是 不知道呢 眼尾跳一下吧
All right,it'll be something,I don't know,a little bit,you know,twitchy.

412
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,850
好了 那还差不多
Okay,I suppose that's a bit more like it.

413
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,970
我们让Jake先按着Danny的猫腻 赢一点钱,那他才会信我的
We let Jake win on a few of Danny's tells,so he'll know he can trust me.

414
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,040
好啊
Good.

415
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,690
Danny让他上钩后 就离开赌局
Once Danny's let Jake beat him,he'll be out of the game...

416
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,250
就剩下Jake跟我了
and it'll just be Jake and me.

417
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,890
这时就是我们的天下了 对吧 Stacie?
At which point,we'll play our joker.Stacie?

418
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:19,970
我想赌局前再过去看他一次
I think that I should pay Jake one more visit before the game.

419
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,400
有必要吗?
Is that really necessary?

420
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,530
我觉得有
I think so.

421
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,960
好了 你现在引他上钩了
Well,you've already reeled him in.

422
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,920
我们可是全副身家放进去了的 我得确认一下
We're gambling everything we've got on this.I need to be sure.

423
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,720
对不起
Excuse me.

424
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,330
对 你好
Ja.Hello.

425
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,330

00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,810
先休息两分钟再继续
Two-minute break before the next hand.

576
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:20,010
来 来
Come on,come on.

577
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:23,530
对了 Ed 是我
Yeah,Ed,it's me.

578
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,600
他们怎么样了?我该打电话了吧?
What are they up to?Is it time?

579
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,210
好的 我会搞定
Okay,I'm on it.

580
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,560
－别接了 －对不起 我得接的
- Leave it alone. - Sorry,I gotta take it.

581
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,160
喂?
Hello?

582
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,010
你是谁?
Who is this?

583
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,850
她快生了 我想你最好快过来
She's not far off now,Mr.Lacey.I think you'd better get over here.

584
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,040
- 她要见你 - 这样 好的
- She's asking for you,yes. - Yeah,all right.

585
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,130
妈的
Shit,shit.

586
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:50,330
不跟
Fold.

587
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,170
不跟
Fold.

588
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,730
全下了 20000
All in.20,000.

589
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,280
你输了
You're out of the game.

590
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:05,650
休息一下
Break.

591
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,410
来杯水
Glass of water,please.

592
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,400
你觉得Micky开始起疑心了吗?
Do you think Mickey suspects anything?

593
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,730
- 怀疑什么? - 我们的事啊
- Such as? - Between us.

594
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,920
我们之间没事
There is no "us."

595
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,250
没有吗?
Isn't there?

596
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,640
你知道我想怎样吗?
Do you know what I wish,Jake?

597
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,880
怎样?
What?

598
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,640
我想你最好一直都没出现过
That you'd never shown up at all.

599
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,930
我已经忘了你了 但你一出现
I'd almost managed to forget about you,and yet here you are...

600
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,000
就把我的生活搞得乱七八糟的
messing up my life again.

601
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,610
有多糟呢?
How exactly am I messing it up?

602
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,160
你把我搞糊涂了
Because you've got me so confused.

603
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,320
还有呢?
About what?

604
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,130
Mickey
Mickey.

605
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,320
他们想骗你
They're trying to con you.

606
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:19,440
就是为这我之前去你酒店找你
That's why I came to your hotel room earlier.

607
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,650
想叫你别来了
To try to get you to stop playing.

608
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,290
除了刚走的两个 他们都是认识的
They all know each other,apart from the two who are already out.

609
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,130
Richie会有些小动作 那是假的 这样才能骗你
Richie's gonna give you a false tell,then they'll wait till you've gone all in.

610
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,090
Richie会拿一副好牌
Richie will have a better hand than you...

611
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:36,770
然后就做些小动作 让你觉得是副烂牌
but you're supposed to think it's a poor hand.

612
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:40,890
这样就能骗到你了
The "sure-fire tell" isn't so sure-fire after all.

613
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,480
如果Richie输了 我就坐在Mickey后面
So,once Richie's out,I'll stand behind Mickey...

614
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,600
告诉你他有什么牌
and indicate to you what cards he's got in his hand.

615
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:54,080
你干吗告诉我这些?
Why exactly are you telling me this?

616
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,450
因为我相信你爱我
Because I believed you when you said you loved me.

617
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,090
我是爱你
I do.

618
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:10,640
不是吧 在重拾旧欢啊?
Don't tell me.You're catching up on old times?

619
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,240
差不多
Something like that.

620
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,560
Jake 算了吧
Jake,give it up.

621
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,010
什么?
Sorry?

622
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,080
想去拿不属于你的东西 那是浪费时间
Trying to take what doesn't belong to you.You're wasting your time.

623
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,440
30,000.
30,000.

624
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,610
- 我想你在吹牛 - 那跟啊
- I think you're bluffing. - Call me,then.

625
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,170
我会的
I'll call you.

626
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:01,080
那你就给我钱了
Give it to me,boy.Oh,yeah.

627
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,170
我会跟
I'll go all in.

628
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,650
跟
Call.

629
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,040
- 输了吧? - 3个6
- Suck on them. - Three sixes.

630
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,130
同花顺
Straight flush.

631
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,080
骗人吧
It's a fix.

632
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,130
你输了
You're out,Richie.

633
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,400
我从未见过有人有同花顺
I've never seen anybody get a straight flush.

634
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:38,720
跟他杯香槟 我请
Get him a champagne,please.On me.

635
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,130
Benny 你是个老千
Benny,you're a bottom-card dealer and a bum.

636
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,050
我不跟你们这些业余玩了
I'm not playing any of you amateurs.

637
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,480
剩下你跟我了Mickey 你觉得你走运了吧?
Just you and me,Mickey.You feeling lucky?

638
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,650
Jake 我不信命运
Jake,I don't rely on luck.

639
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,720
休息两分钟 各位
Two-minute break,gentlemen.

640
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:05,120
好了 各位
Time,gentlemen.

641
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:11,130
依老规矩
Just like old times.

642
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,760
现在你没这么自信了吧Jake?
You're really feeling that confident,Jake?

643
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:16,290
我对手比我强的时候我才会不自信的
Only when I'm playing someone who thinks he's better than me.

644
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,010
我想你会输喔
I think you're the one who's about to go down.

645
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,680
我真喜欢这
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

646
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,370

Stace,that thing we talked about.

648
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,360
算了 我不要人帮
Forget it.I don't need any help.

649
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,520
我要堂堂正正赢他
I feel like playing this thing for real.

650
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,050
什么?
What?

651
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,520

算了吧 Mickey...
And let's face it,Mickey...

691
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,480
你从来没想过要我 对吧?
you never really wanted me,did you?

692
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:52,360
但Jake想过
And Jake does.

693
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:56,490
这不是很好吗?我意思是 应该就要这样
This is a wind-up,right?I mean,it has to be.

694
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,130
- 我们走吧 - Stacie?

我不要收拾一下吗?
Shouldn't we pick up some of my stuff first?

703
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:37,120
这样Mickey就能跟上来了吧?
And let Mickey catch up to us?

704
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,890
糟了 Jake!
No,Jake!

调头
Change of plan.

707
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,720

711
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,810
真不敢相信你会这样做
I can't believe you're doing this.

712
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:27,170
Stacie 无论他跟你说什么 别相信啊
Stacie,whatever he's promised you,don't fall for it.

713

Stacie 我问你 我求你了
Stacie,I'm asking you,I am begging you...

714
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,370
别这样做
please do not do this.

715
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,370
我们没你了怎么办?
What the hell are we going to do without you?

716
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:44,120
对不起
I'm sorry.

717
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,250
我又赢你了吧?
Not the only thing I won off you again,is it?

718
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,200
你赢我了?
You "won" me?

719
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:10,520
好像我是个奖品似的
Makes it sound like I'm a prize in some raffle.

720
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:12,970
对 可是你是最好的啊
Yeah,but you'd be the first prize.

721
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:18,570
- 谢谢 - 只是开个玩笑 没关系吧?
- Thanks. - It's a joke.Does it matter?

722
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,170
最重要的是我们又一起了
The main thing is that we're back together again.

723
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,050
有关系
It matters to me.

724
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,370
你是这样看我的啊 Jake?
Is that how you see me,Jake?

725
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:29,650
就像个奖杯 好让你能在人家面前炫耀啊?
As a trophy you can show off to your friends when it suits you?

726
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:30,720
不是,Stace
Come on,Stace.

727
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:32,800
你一直都是那么想的 对吧?
That's what this has all been about,hasn't it?
