00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,740
孩子们,你们知道那张在敦煌的照片么?
Kids, you know that photo In the den?

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,310
回溯到2006年 外公外婆来看我, 我们出去共享早餐
It was taken back in 2006,when grandma and grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch.

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,360
我们看上去都很高兴, 是吗?
We all look pretty happy,right?

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,370
错
wrong.

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,800
我希望你的脸最好融化掉
I wish your face would melt off.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,080
我还希望你的眼球最好爆炸
I wish your eyeballs would explode.

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:15,720
我讨厌你
I hate you.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,590
我更加讨厌你
I hate you more.

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:18,410
我会杀了他的
I'm going to kill him.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,680
我不能责怪你
I can't say I blame you.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,060
不, 我是认真的
No,I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,480
我不管你有多不愿意
I don't care how unpleasant it is.

13
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,410
你必须和他谈谈
You have to talk to him.

14
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,170
但是不是现在
Not now.

15
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,450
好吧, 你不去我去
Okay,if you don't,I will.

16
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,760
Robin...
Robin...

17
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,820
好吧, 要理解这些东西 你必须知道, 这个故事有3个部分
okay,for any of this to make sense,you got to understand,there are three parts to this story.

18
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,020
那我们就先从Marshall和Lily的部分开始好了
Let's start with the marshall and lily part.

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,100
Marshall和Lily的部分

作为30周年纪念的礼物 我让我的父母到纽约来度周末
As a 30th anniversary gift,I had flown my parents to new york for the weekend.

21
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,030
哦忘了和你说了 你堂弟Jimmy很喜欢那个温泉
Oh,I forgot to tell you,your cousin jimmy had a wonderful time at that spa he visited.

22
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,560
你是说法官让他去戒毒的那个温泉?
You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,580
要咖啡吗?
Coffee?

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,070
外婆和外公不喜欢讨论任何不愉快的 太感性的或者说是任何真实的事情
Now,grandma and grandpa didn't like to talk about things that were uncomfortable,emotional,or in any way...real.

25
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,900
嗨, Mosby先生, 夫人
Hi,mr.And mrs.Mosby.

26
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,950
哦, Lily!

27
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,940
嗨, Marshall

28
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,880
见到你很高兴
Good to see you.

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,450
我只是过来收拾一下自己的东西
I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.

30
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,020
我们很抱歉你的...

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,310
好吧...

33
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,310
Lily把我甩了, 为了逃婚的事情?
lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,370
我请求Marshall重修旧好 然后他拒绝了我的事情?
Me begging marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?

35
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,810

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,200
自从Marshall和Lily分手之后 这是他们的第二次见面
This only the second time Marshall and lily had seen each other since breaking up,

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,610
但是正如他们保证的那样 情况也并不是那么尴尬
but to their credit,it wasn't that awkward.

40
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,000
事实上, 我们很好
Actually,we're cool.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,910
我刚才分了一下唱片
We just divided up cds.

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,080
都是些本土歌手唱的
It was all very civil.

43
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,800
我为我们而感到骄傲 现在这样很好
I'm proud of us; we're,we're good.

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,230
我们8点去Casa A Pezzi吃饭
Well,we were all going to go to casa a pezzi at 8:00.

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,720
要不要和我们一起去, Lily?
Lily,would you like to join us?

46
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,690
什么?
what?

47
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,050
如果这会让你们不舒服的话 我看还是算了
Well,I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.

48
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,340
怎么会呢?
Why would it?

49
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,400
我是说, 我们...
Well,I mean,yeah,we're...

50
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,610
我们现在这样是很好 但是我们之间还是有点那个什么
we're good,but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.

51
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,490
我不觉得
Um,not for me.

52
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,810
我们现在看上去就像是朋友
Now it's just like we're friends.

53
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,360
就像是兄妹一样
It's like we're brother and sister.

54
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,990
"兄妹"?
"Brother and sister"?

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:22,640
好吧
Okay.

56
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,600
好吧, 等会在餐馆见, 哥哥
Fine,yeah,I'll see you at the restaurant,bro.

57
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,530
看到没?
See?

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,310
一点也不尴尬吧
Not awkward at all.

59
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,540
各位好啊
Lily: Hello,everyone.

60
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,150
嗨
Hi.

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,670
好啊, Marshall
Hello,marshall.

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,060
Lily, 这裙子太棒了
Lily,that is a stunning dress.

63
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,940
哦谢谢
Oh,thanks.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,700
我想你应该还没忘吧 但是我觉得我们是一家人, 是吗哥哥?
It's kind of revealing,but I thought,"hey,we're all family.Right,bro?

65
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,910
这是怎么了?
What's wrong?

66
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,280
哦, 我今天做瑜珈的时候伤到脚踝了
Oh,I,I hurt my ankle in yoga today.

67
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,990
教练让我用深呼吸忍痛, 只是...
The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain,just...

68
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,500
你还好吗?
are you all right?

69
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,170
你好像在流汗啊
You're kind of sweating.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,060
没有, 我很好
No,I'm fine.

71
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,250
只是...
It's just...

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,410
这东西太辣了
this roll is really spicy.

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,530
Lily太可恶了!
Lily is evil!

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,550
她穿了那个裙子来折磨我
She just wore that dress to torture me.

75
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,630
好吧, 这个游戏有两个人的份
Well,you know what?Two can play at that game.

76
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,720
看着吧, 就早餐的时候 我会好好折磨Lily一番
See,at brunch,I'm going to torture lily right back.

77
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,430
是的
Yeah.

78
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,860
我身上也有一地方是她的弱点
There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for,too.

79
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,380
嘿, 你不能在早餐的时候说这个(暗指Marshall的Ding-Dong)
Dude,you can't whip that out at brunch.

80
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,030
不, 不是那个
No,not that.

81
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,460
我要露露我的小腿
I'm going to unleash my calves.

82
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,350
这太变态了
That's crazy.

83
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,360
没人会因为男人的小腿兴奋
Nobody's turned on by men's calves.

84
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,840
他们完全没有性暗示
They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,510
我必须说 如果我也像这样小的鸡腿的话
Well,yeah,I'd say that,too,if I had those skinny little chicken legs.

86
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,120
我会等你打电话来道歉的
I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.

87
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,270
然后Marshall就在早餐的时候用了这个计划
So marshall showed up at brunch with a plan.

88
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:51,990
你好
Hello.

89
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:52,920
哦, 嗨
Oh,hi.

90
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,970
嘿, Marshall
Hey,marshall.

91
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,800
怎么样?
How are you feeling?

92
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,190
你昨晚看上去有点狂热
You looked kind of feverish last night.

93
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,570
哦不, 我感觉很好
Oh,no,I actually feel great.

94
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:03,560
这里好像挺热的, 不是吗?
It is kind of warm in here,though,isn't it?

95
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,210
哦我不清楚 只是有点...
Oh,I don't know,if anything,it's kind of...

96
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,200
你在干什么?
what are you doing?

97
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,500
哦没什么
Oh,nothing.

98
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,040
没什么
Nothing at all.

99
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,880
只是让自己坐的更加舒服一点
I'm just making myself feel a little bit more...comfortable.

100
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,760
哦很好
Oh,yes.

101
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,250
我最近一直在做手指按摩, 所以...
I've been doing all these toe lifts lately,and so...

102
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,150
我的小腿已经紧绷多了
my calves have really been cramping up.

103
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,080
把你的衬衫脱了
take off your shirt.

104
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,020
剩下的裤子也脱了
Take off the rest of your pants.

105
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,970
我真没想到会发生这个
I really wasn't expecting that to happen.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,710
我也没想到
Yeah,me neither.

107
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,040
这好像有点复杂了, 不是吗?
It kind of complicates things,doesn't it?

108
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,100
是的
Yeah,it does.

109
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,080
你为什么要露你完美的小腿给我看?
Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me?

110
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,730
你知道你有一副船夫的腿
You know you have a punter's leg.

111
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,240
那你为什么要把你的胸部给我看?
Well,why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me?

112
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,180
你知道你有...胸部
You know you have...boobs.

113
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,590
说白了吧, 你来这里只是为了引诱我
Just admit it,you came here trying to seduce me.

114
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,490
我引诱你? 是你在引诱我吧
Seduce you?You seduced me.

115
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,350
你坐在我边上 然后都快把裤子脱光了
You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,760
你去了旧金山3个月
You went to san francisco for three months.

117
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,050
那个怎么能引诱的了你啊?
How is that seducing you?

118
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,690
好吧, 那并没有 但是我还是很生气
Well,it's not but I'm still mad about it.

119
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,170
好吧, 就这样吧 我要Beatles诗选
All right,that's it-- I want the beatles anthology.

120
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,580
太糟糕了, 我并不打算给你
Oh,well,that's too bad; I'm keeping it.

121
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,640
那你还记得我给你的U2的盒子吗?
And you know the u2 box set I gave you?

122
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,690
看看, 都是Dave Matthews
Look inside-- all dave matthews.

123
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,060
你真可恶
You are evil.

124
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,470
笑一个
Smile.

125
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,850
我要杀了他
I'm going to kill him.

126
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,170
我不能责怪你
I can't say I blame you.

127
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,720
不, 我是说我真的想杀了他
No,I mean I'm seriously going to kill him.

128
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,940
接下来让我们说说Barney的部分好了
Now let's talk about the barney part of the story.

129
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,830
Barney的部分
the barney part

130
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,720
这是Robin第一次见我的父母 所以我们俩都有点紧张
This was going to be robin's first time meeting my parents,so we were both a little nervous.

131
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,630
Barney, 你在这里做什么?
barney,what are you doing here?

132
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
我在这里等见家长
I'm here to meet your parents.

133
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,810
听了你说的关于Barney的传奇故事之后 他们肯定迫不及待的想见到我
They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary barney stories you've told them.

134
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,910
我没告诉他们一点你的传奇故事
I haven't told them any legendary barney stories.

135
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,700
什么?
What?

136
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,870
Barney, 这里列了我告诉父亲的所有东西 棒球
Barney,here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about: Baseball.

137
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,330
但是我是你最好的朋友
But I'm your best friend.

138
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,290
事实上, Marshall是我...
Well,actually marshall's my...

139
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,250
我是你生命中最重要的人
I'm the most important person in your life.

140
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,250
事实上Robin是...
Well,robin's actually...

141
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,450
你父母怎么能不知道我呢?
How could your parents not know about me?

142
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,970
我可是很会耍宝的
I'm delightful.

143
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,380
对于我们而言, 当然是, 不过也就这么一点
To us,sure,in very small,infrequent doses.

144
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,940
我是说, 拜托, 你不是那种 父母希望自己孩子交的朋友
I mean,come on,you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.

145
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,470
哦是吗?
Oh,really?

146
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,470
那我相信你穿的这鞋子 不是你今天犯的最大的错误
Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.

147
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:26,630
嘿, 妈妈
hey,mom.

148
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,330
- 嘿, 老爸 - Ted
Hey,dad. Ted.

149
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,500
- 我知道你们一定很想见到... - Barney Stinson
I know you've all been excited to meet... barney stinson.

150
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,160
很荣幸见到你们
An honor to meet the two of you.

151
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,020
那个绣了"保佑这个邋遢鬼"的枕头是你做给Ted的吧 做的真是太好了
That needlepoint "bless this mess" pillow you made for ted-- what a stitch.

152
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
沉默的孩子(Stitch的另外一个意思)! 那刚才那个算什么?
Stitch!Did that just happen?

153
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,120
哦, 老爸老妈 这是我的女朋友, Robin
Uh,mom,dad,this is my girlfriend,robin.

154
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,880
你好
Hello.

155
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,910
见到你真是太棒了, Robin
Oh,it's wonderful to meet you,robin.

156
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,550
你真漂亮
Oh,you are so pretty.

157
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,870
不是吗, Al?
Isn't she pretty,al?

158
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,930
当然
A real looker.

159
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,130
说来好笑 我今天甚至没有照过镜子呢
That's funny,I didn't even "look" in the mirror today.

160
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,810
当我没说
That's not anything,is it?

161
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,560
我在San Marino订了位子 晚上8点的
So,I made a reservation at san marino tonight for 8:00.

162
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,750
San Marino
San marino.

163
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,910
你说真的?
Oh,you're serious?

164
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,760
哦算了吧
Yikes.No.

165
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,890
我们还是试试Casa A Pezzi
We have to try casa a pezzi.

166
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,970
那里的鲑鱼调味饭真是棒极了
Best salmon risotto I have ever had.

167
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,410
我爱鲑鱼调味饭
I love salmon risotto.

168
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,990
我知道
I know.

169
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,740
我们怎么在Casa A Pezzi订到桌子?
How are we supposed to get a table at casa a pezzi?

170
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,990
他们只接受提前几周的预定
They're booked for weeks.

171
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,250
你真是幸运 我认识那里的服务经理, 真是讽刺...
Well,lucky for you,I happen to know the head waitress,which is ironic because...

172
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:30,250
真是讽刺因为我们都在同一个地方服务
ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where i serve the food.

173
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,130
你在哪里高就, Robin?
where do you volunteer,robin?

174
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,320
你到底是怎么回事?
What's the matter with you?

175
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,960
我是他女朋友 我正努力表现的很好
I'm his girlfriend,and I'm not even trying that hard.

176
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,010
能得到他们一些好感, 你个笨蛋
Way to wreck the curve,kiss-ass.

177
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,770
Robin, 我是他最好的朋友
Robin,I'm his best friend.

178
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,050
这是我应该做的
That's a commitment.

179
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,740
女朋友, 就像是一场感冒
Girlfriend,that's like a bad flu.

180
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,820
在床上躺上几周就完全不受你的摆布了
Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed.

181
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,500
击掌
High five.

182
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,130
我能帮上什么吗?
Can I help?

183
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
当然, Virginia
Yes,you can,virginia.

184
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,410
这件外套背后肯定有一个故事 我想听听
There's a story behind that broach,and I'm going to hear it.

185
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,250
哦, 你真是问对了
Well,funny you should ask.

186
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,440
好啊, Barney
Bravo,barney.

187
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,460
这是我一直都很喜欢的奏鸣曲
That is my all-time favorite sonata.

188
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,180
Barney, 你真讨人喜欢
Barney,you are just delightful.

189
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,550
不, Virginia, 你很讨喜 我只是讨Ted的喜
No,virginia,you're delightful,I am deligh-ted.

190
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,820
Ted就在那里
And he's just ted.

191
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,520
我可没有事先安排什么 真是巧了
I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.

192
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,320
呜哦
whoops.

193
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,560
我想我把一冰块掉进去了
I think I dropped an ice cube down here.

194
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,350
哇哦, 好冷啊
Ow,it's so cold.

195
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,010
好吧, 我想我要走了
All right,that's it,I'm out of here.

196
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,560
1分钟后
In a minute.

197
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,760
谁要去Maclaren喝一杯?
Anyone up for a drink at maclaren's?

198
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,710
不了, 我有点累了
No,I'm kind of tired.

199
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,360
我也是
Me,too.

200
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,590
是啊, 我也觉得他们想要...
Yeah,I'm sure my folks are gonna want...

201
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,650
我想我能带一些Cerveza(墨西哥的一种酒)回去
I feel like I could knock back a few cervezas.

202
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,510
Cerveza?
Cervezas?

203
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,940
他吃错药了?
Did he fall?

204
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,040
我也加入 不过我明天得早起
I'd join you,too,but I want to get up early for mass tomorrow.

205
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,790
8点45分在St.Peter教堂是吗? 这是我最爱的仪式
St.Peter's,8:45 A.M.,It's my favorite service.

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,970
等等 你能进教堂了?
Wait a minute-- you're able to cross the threshold of a church?

207
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,620
我会给你留一个位子的
I'll save you a seat.

208
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,830
哦, 你真是太棒了
Oh,you are just terrific.

209
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,020
不是吗, Susan?
Isn't he,susan?

210
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,470
Robin
Robin.

211
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,490
Susan, 她叫Virginia
Susan,her name is virginia.

212
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,870
伙计, 我现在真想好好教训你一下你父亲
Dude,I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.

213
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,060
为什么?
Why?

214
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,750
昨天晚上我们不是一起去Maclaren喝酒了吗?
Last night,we go to maclaren's for a drink,right?

215
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,830
然后Barney冲进火房 举起压着我的冰箱, 把我救了出去
So barney darts back into the burning house,lifts up the refrigerator I'm pinned under and pulls me to safety.

216
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,010
你真是个英雄
You're like a hero.

217
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,170
哦算不上什么英雄, Wendy
Oh,I'm no hero,wendy.

218
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,300
你知道谁是吗?
You know who is a hero?

219
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,130
我的达尔马提亚伙伴, Smokey
My dalmatian,smokey.

220
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,760
他...没能...没能逃出来
He...didn'T...make it out.

221
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,730
对不起
I'm sorry.

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,190
真可怜, 伙计
You poor,brave man.

223
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,520
为什么你不给他一个拥抱呢?
Why don't you give the guy a hug?

224
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,500
我...
I'M...

225
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,950
我老爸给你做媒?
My dad was your wingman?

226
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,480
我的脑子现在一团乱
This is really messing with my head.

227
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
Barney, 我老爸酷不?
Barney,is my dad cool?

228
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,120
我还没说完
I'm not done.

229
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,800
然后你老爸留在那里接着喝 我提早回去了, 因为第二天要和你妈妈一起早起
So,your dad stays to finish his drink,but I take off because I have to be up early for mass with your mom.

230
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,180
当然
Sure.

231
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,290
我发现我的手机忘在那里了 所以我回去拿...
Anyway,I realize that I left my phone on the bar,so I come back...

232
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,390
哦我的天啊
oh,my god.

233
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,650
这真的是...
Is that really...

234
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,370
哦我的天啊!
oh,my god!

235
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,820
我知道
I know.

236
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,260
你能相信你爸爸给我带了绿帽子吗?
Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?

237
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,720
我爸爸和女服务生Wendy有一手?
My dad made out with wendy the waitress?

238
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,880
他欺骗了我妈妈
He cheated on my mom?

239
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,340
不, 这不可能
No,that's impossible.

240
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:46,300
Ted, 根据调查 有83%的男人在结婚后6个月就在外面有一手
Ted,it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.

241
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,380
你知道吗? 你每次举例子的时候用的都是83%这个数字
Do you know that when you make up a statistic,you always use "83%"?

242
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,850
你觉得我在说谎?
You think I'm lying.

243
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,870
好吧, 你有做过关于这个的调查吗?
Well,have you done any surveys on the subject?

244
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,630
在www.时髦的人.婚姻出轨是天性.org 这个网站上就有人做过调查
Because the good people at www.Swingers.Open-marriage-is natural legalize-polygamy.Org have,

245
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,480
他们一开始也不相信
and they beg to differ.

246
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,860
根本就没这个网站
That's not a real web site.

247
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,330
哦我真希望我没有得到他们网站的VIP体恤
Oh,and I suppose I didn't get a real t-shirt for running in their 10k.

248
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,540
嘿, 老爸
hi,dad.

249
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,090
嘿, Ted
Hey,ted.

250
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,090
Barney
Barney.

251
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,610
旅途还算愉快吗?
Ted: Enjoying your vacation so far?

252
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,910
哦是的
Oh,yeah.

253
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,810
听着, 我能和你去外面谈会儿吗?
Uh,listen,can I speak to you outside for a sec?

254
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,150
当然
Sure.

255
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,970
你昨天晚上和Baryney一起出去了?
So you went out with barney last night?

256
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,810
是的
Yeah.

257
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,530
你玩的很开心?
You have a good time?

258
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,160
哦当然
Oh,yeah,yeah.

259
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,240
真可惜你没有来
Sorry you couldn't join us.

260
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,610
是的
Yeah.

261
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,720
那么...
So...

262
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,850
什么?
what?

263
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,790
好吧...
Well...

264
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,470
什么好吧?
well what?

265
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,990
你觉得Cerrano(棒球队员)转到打点位能成功吗?
You think cerrano's got a shot at the rbi title?

266
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,600
我想向他证实的, 但是我做不到
I wanted to confront him,but I couldn'T.

267
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:53,700
我想我也带了"不谈任何不愉快的事情"的基因
I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about- anything- uncomfortable gene.

268
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,400
好吧, 你没有遗传你父亲的"速战速决"的基因 那是肯定的
Well,you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene,that's for sure.

269
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,900
笑笑
Smile.

270
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,330
很好
Great.

271
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,480
我不管这有多不舒服
I don't care how unpleasant it is.

272
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,810
我要你现在就和他谈谈
You have to talk to him.

273
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,960
现在不行
Not now.

274
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,810
好吧, 你不说我说
Okay,if you don't,I will.

275
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,110
Robin...
Robin...

276
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,970
好吧, 现在我们从头开始 说说我和Robin的部分吧
Okay,now I got to back up all the way to the beginning to tell you the me and robin part of the story.

277
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,850
我和Robin的部分
the me and robin part

278
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,600
我们正随时准备迎接父母的到来
We were expecting my parents at any minute.

279
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,180
关于我妈妈的最后一点
One last thing about my mom.

280
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,240
她审问我每一任女友 我们什么时候结婚, 什么时候生小孩
She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.

281
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,860
但是这是她第一次见到我
But this is the first time she's meeting me.

282
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,390
没关系
Doesn't matter.

283
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,950
如果她提到我的堂妹Stacy, 就说明她准备发问了 Stacy在5年内生了6个孩子
And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin stacy-- six kids in five years.

284
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,000
基本上那个女人已经不成人样了
The woman's basically a ride at a water park.

285
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,230
但是我根本不打算结婚生子
But I don't want to get married and have kids.

286
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,740
我要怎么回应啊?
What am I supposed to say?

287
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,810
你知道吗?
You know what?

288
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,720
你是一个有主见的成人了
You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions.

289
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,150
你不用为此向他们道歉
You shouldn't have to apologize for them.

290
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,030
我得撒谎了
I'm gonna lie.

291
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,740
我来说
I would.

292
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,670
谢谢你给了我U2的盒子
Thanks again for letting me have the u2 box set.

293
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,970
我知道那个对你多重要
I know how important it is to you.

294
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,380
我那天和你Caroline姨妈聊天的时候
I talked to aunt caroline the other day.

295
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,540
她说Stacy又怀孕了
Stacy's pregnant again.

296
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,830
哦, 好消息
Oh,good for her.

297
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,290
那么, 亲爱的...
So,dear...

298
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,590
说说你做记者的趣闻吧
oh,boy.Tell us what it's like being a journalist.

299
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,440
我还没准备好
I'm just not ready.

300
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,870
好吧, 别有压力
Okay.No pressure.

301
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,930
嗯, 我以为你要...
Uh,I thought you,um...

302
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,680
工作很好
it's great.

303
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
很好
Good.

304
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,950
现在要把重心放在工作上 毕竟你的直接生涯已经快要结束了
Focus on your job now,because your career clock is ticking.

305
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,460
然后好好准备结婚生子 其他的都暂时放一下吧
There's time for marriage and kids and all that other stuff later.

306
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,650
哦, 有钢琴!
Ooh,a piano!

307
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,120
昨天晚上你还真是逢凶化吉啊?
Ted: You lucked out with my mom last night,huh?

308
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,270
松了口气是吗?
What a relief,right?

309
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,460
当然
Oh,absolutely.

310
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,100
真高兴知道我是一个你妈妈 不想你和我有孩子的女朋友
Whew,what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.

311
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,470
那我是要说太棒了?
Hooray?

312
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,980
我是说, 她是不是认为只有你那个高中女友Cheryl 才能和你生出像样的孩子?
I mean,did she really think that your college girlfriend cheryl would pop out attractive children?

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,870
因为我看过她的照片 她的额头就像是山洞怪人似的
'Cause I've seen pictures,and,I'm sorry,that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.

314
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,640
拜托, 她的额头正好对着光线
Come on,she was just frowning under direct light.

315
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,780
另外, 我不单单不喜欢她这点 还有她的...
And besides,that's not even what I liked about her.It was her...

316
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,340
似乎无关紧要了
it's not important.

317
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,990
Marshall和Lily怎么回事?
What happened to marshall and lily?

318
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,420
他们最近一直都在吵
They've been fighting lately.

319
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,740
也许又跑到什么地方吵去了吧
They're probably off somewhere going at it.

320
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,740
加点咖啡吗?
More coffee?

321
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,900
哦不了, 谢谢
Oh,no,thank you.

322
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,000
她真是不错啊?
Isn't she sweet?

323
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,910
如果她不错 那让她和Ted生孩子好了
Well,if she's so sweet,maybe she should have ted's babies.

324
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,450
你说什么?
Excuse me?

325
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,900
没什么
Nothing.

326
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,630
等1分钟
Lily: Just a minute.

327
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,260
也许不用
Marshall: Maybe less.

328
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,740
Robin, 亲爱的
Robin,dear.

329
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,760
我说了什么让你不开心的话了吗?
Did I say something to upset you?

330
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,550
你为什么不希望我有你的孙子?
Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?

331
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,570
你要让我抱孙子了?
Do you want to have my grandkids?

332
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,500
不!
No!

333
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,600
我是说, 我也不知道
I mean,I don't know.

334
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,230
我只是...
I just...

335
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,030
我要你觉得我是想要有你的孙子的
I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids.

336
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,740
当然
And you should.

337
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,730
我是一座基因金山
I'm a genetic gold mine.

338
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,450
没有家族糖尿病或是心脏病史
No family history of diabetes or heart disease.

339
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,850
所有的人都没有蛀牙 视力都极佳
Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight.

340
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,180
我有一个患精神分裂的叔叔 但是得的也是很高级的种类
I had one schizophrenic uncle,but even he had perfect vision.

341
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:56,810
虽然对于他生活着的那个镇的人来说很不幸 但是他还是一个好人
Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in,but still he w a very fine man,and...

342
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,530
抱歉
excuse me.Sorry.

343
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,020
不知道已经排队等了
Didn't know that there was a line.

344
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,660
Marshall你的拉链
Marshall,your zipper.

345
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,700
Robin, 不是我不想要孙子
Robin,it's not that i don't want grandkids.

346
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,950
我只是不认为每个人都要犯 过早结婚这个错误的
It's just I don't think anyone should make the mistake of getting married too young.

347
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:17,860
你怎么这么说?
Why do you say that?

348
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,570
我是说, 你很早就结婚了
I mean,you got married pretty young.

349
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,680
那并不是一个错误
That wasn't a mistake.

350
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,220
难道是?
Was it?

351
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,830
好吧, 有些事情你并不知道
okay,there's something you don't know.

352
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,340
笑一个
Smile.

353
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,350
我希望你的脸最好化掉
I wish your face would melt off.

354
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,820
我想你的眼球最好炸掉
I wish your eyeballs would explode.

355
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,600
我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

356
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,030
我不管这有多不舒服 但是你必须和他谈谈
I don't care how unpleasant it is,you have to talk to him.

357
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,800
现在不行
Not now.

358
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,080
好吧, 你不说我说
Okay,if you don't,I will.

359
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,540
Robin..
Robin...

360
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,260
哦天啊 让我来帮帮你, 亲爱的
Oh,gosh,let me help you pick those up,sweetheart.

361
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,370
亲爱的?
Sweetheart?

362
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,500
亲爱的?
Sweetheart?

363
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,330
你心中唯一一个亲爱的 应该是和你在一起30年的女人
The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago,

364
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,150
不是昨晚在酒吧的那个 不是这个笨手笨脚的荡妇
not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy!

365
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,430
抱歉, 我不是说你是荡妇
I'm sorry,you're not a floozy.

366
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,060
我很郁闷 我都不知道自己再说什么
I'm upset,I don't know what I'm saying.

367
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:58,540
但是, 离我爸爸远点
But stay away from my dad.

368
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,500
Ted, 你在说什么?
Ted,what are you talking about?

369
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,730
老爸?
Dad?

370
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,170
你应该告诉妈妈昨天晚上在酒吧的事情了吧?
You,uh,want to tell mom what happened at the bar last night?

371
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,860
好吧
Okay.

372
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,330
我和一个女服务生亲热了
I hooked up with a waitress.

373
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,230
我是说, 哦!
I mean,oh!

374
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,160
等我们回去了要好好谈谈, Al
We're going to have a serious talk about this when we get home,al.

375
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,260
好好谈谈? 妈妈, 怎么...
Serious talk?Mom,what...

376
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,530
他和另外一个女的接吻啊
He was kissing another woman.

377
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,670
你一点都不在乎?
Don't you care?

378
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,510
Mosby夫人?
Mrs.Mosby?

379
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,680
Ted, 我们不知道到底该怎么告诉你...
Ted,we weren't quite sure how to tell you this...

380
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,960
你妈妈和我离婚了
your mother and i are divorced.

381
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,640
你们...
You...

382
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,520
你们离婚了是什么意思?
what do you mean you're divorced?

383
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,330
什么时候的事情?
Since when?

384
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,930
哦, 差不多9个月了吧
Oh,gosh,it's been about nine months now.

385
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,110
快10个月了
Closer to ten,I think.

386
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,190
时间过的真快
Time flies.

387
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,620
也就是说10个月前 你们突然决定瞒着我离婚了?
so ten months ago,you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?

388
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,180
不, 这不是一时的决定
No,it wasn't a snap decision.

389
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,810
我们已经差不多分居2年了
We'd been separated almost two years.

390
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,790
你们怎么什么都没告诉我?
How could you not tell me this?

391
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,190
我们想说的, 但是一直没有找到合适的机会
We meant to,it just never seemed like the right time.

392
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,090
那么去年圣诞节...
So last christmas...

393
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,970
我们想告诉你的 但是发现那样就破坏圣诞气氛了
We talked about telling you kids then,but it didn't seem very christmasy.

394
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,070
我给你们买的协力自行车呢?
I got you a tandem bike.

395
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,010
哦, 那个没有浪费
Oh,it didn't go to waste.

396
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,390
你妈妈和Frank一直都在骑
Your mother and frank ride it all the time.

397
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,620
谁是Frank?
Who the hell is frank?

398
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,340
哦, 一个很不错的家伙
Oh,great guy.

399
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,270
我的确挺喜欢他的
I actually set them up.

400
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,660
你还记得Muchnik医生吗?
You remember dr.Muchnik.

401
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,920
他帮你做的矫正
He did your braces.

402
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,970
好吧, 我的头要炸了 我不想和你们多说什么, 我走
Okay,my head's about to explode,and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles,so I am leaving.

403
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,200
Teddy宝贝, 哦...
Teddy bear,oh...

404
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,010
他昨天晚上提过他已经离婚了
you know,he mentioned he was divorced last night.

405
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,410
我完全忘记这回事情了
I totally spaced on that.

406
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,460
哦, 煎蛋处没有队伍
Ooh,no line at the omelet station.

407
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,800
Lily...
Lily...

408
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,020
很抱歉我刚才说了那些话
I'm sorry that I said all those things.

409
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,760
我也是
Me,too.

410
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,900
我都不知道怎么呆在你身边了
I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.

411
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,080
我也一样
It's the same for me.

412
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,730
我想我们还是保持一段距离吧
I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.

413
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,490
我也这么觉得
Yeah,I think you're right.

414
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,620
你穿了提胸内衣了?
Are you wearing a push-up bra?

415
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,990
你魔法晒过你的小腿?
Did you mystic tan your calves?

416
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,290
我收回我的问题
I withdraw the question.

417
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,560
我们很抱歉没提过离婚的事情
We're sorry we didn't say anything about the divorce.

418
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,130
真不应该瞒着你
It was wrong not to tell you.

419
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,600
谢谢
Thank you.

420
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,900
但是听着, 别告诉你妹妹
But listen,don't tell your sister.

421
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:44,330
他没法接受这个
It would just upset her.

422
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,160
不, 这太荒谬了!
No,this is ridiculous!

423
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,650
我们要好好谈谈 不单单是棒球
We have to start talking about stuff,and not just baseball.

424
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,480
印第安纳今天赢了
Indians won today on a walk-off double.

425
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,040
对红袜队? 真是一场关键的胜利
Against the red sox? Boy,that's a big win.

426
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,150
不, 不
No.No. No.

427
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,880
别想这么就打发过去
We're not gonna blow past this.

428
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,990
我是说, 我都不知道你们是
I mean,I don't even know who you people.

429
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,230
你们是怎么认识对方的
I don't even know how you met.

430
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,840
我从来没告诉过你怎么和你妈妈认识的?
I never told you how I met your mother?

431
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,290
没有
No.

432
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,690
哦, 很好的一个故事
Oh,great story.

433
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,680
在酒吧
At a bar.

434
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,560
就这样?
That's it?

435
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,490
这就是形成我们这个家庭的过程?
That's what passes for communication in our family?

436
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,740
如果是我, 我会原原本本的告诉我的孩子 我是怎么认识他的母亲的
Man,when I have kids,and I tell them how I met their mother,I'm gonna tell them everything,the whole damn story.

437
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:22,050
我想想, 应该是一个爱尔兰酒吧
I think it was an irish bar.

438
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,690
我不知道...
I just,I don'T...

439
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,560
我真是搞不懂
I don't understand.

440
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,310
你们看上去很开心
You seemed so happy.

441
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,870
我还是小孩的时候, 你们看上去那么...
When I was growing up,you seemed so...

442
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,510
发生什么事情了?

443
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:33,840
我们只是发现我们并不合拍
We just realized we're very different people.

444
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,850
你父亲就像是飘在天上的浪漫 而我是属于脚踏实地地过日子
Your father's kind of a head-in-the-clouds romantic,and I'm much more down to earth.

445
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:39,840
那么?
So?

446
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,140
我和Robin也是这样
Robin and i are like that.

447
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,640
这并不能说明什么
That doesn't mean anything.

448
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,010
我想要孩子
I wanted kids.

449
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,860
但是你母亲...
And your mother...

450
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,590
当然也想要孩子

451

Robin和我有着不同的家庭观

452

我们也不会因为这个而分手的
We're not about to break up because of it.

453

起初我都不想和他一起出去
I didn't even want to go out with him in the beginning.

455
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,720
但是他花了好几个月求我 我终于屈服了
But he spent months badgering me until I finally gave in.

456
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,370
当你没有考虑过多的基本问题的时候
Well,when you don't connect on that many fundamental levels,

457
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,960
认识到不合拍也只是时间问题了
it's only a matter of time before you realize you're not meant to be together.

458
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,570
但是我们爱Robin

当然

看到你就像看到了我的指路明灯
Meeting you was the highlight of my trip.

461
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,340
应该是第二盏灯
Well,second highlight.

462
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,450
我们里面见

我们的确应该尝试着多多沟通

很好, 我想这样才像一家人
