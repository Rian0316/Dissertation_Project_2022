00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:03,427
Here's what you missed
on <i>Shameless</i> last week:

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,658
a whole lot of shit happened.

3
00:00:05,692 --> 00:00:07,021
Where were you?

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:09,301
- Think she'll come out today?
- Not likely.

5
00:00:09,336 --> 00:00:11,171
FRANK:
<i>Airplane wheel</i>
<i>missed her by an inch.</i>

6
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:12,670
(screaming)
They found Eddie.

7
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:14,207
<i>At the bottom of Lake Michigan.</i>

8
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:15,771
Babe?
Your dad's dead.

9
00:00:15,806 --> 00:00:17,473
Nice try,
but that doesn't

10
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:19,508
<i>turn me on anymore.</i>

11
00:00:19,543 --> 00:00:20,980
This is a West Point
application.

12
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,218
I wanted to deliver it
personally. Is Lip home?

13
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:24,834
What, McNally brought
this for you?

14
00:00:24,835 --> 00:00:26,020
- Not me.
- Congratulations.

15
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,154
VERONICA:
Malik?

16
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:28,823
ETHEL:
<i>We're having a play date.</i>

17
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:29,958
Sounds more like
a date-date.

18
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:31,497
I hope someone
takes care of him.

19
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,265
Don't you think Clyde
deserves that?

20
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:33,967
Oh, for sure.

21
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,702
You Clyde?
Ethel says hi.

22
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:37,404
Aah!

23
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,476
- Karen's pregnant.
- That's the Gallagher sperm.

24
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,812
Do the right thing.
Split.

25
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,483
Kids need a father.
Jody and I got hitched.

26
00:00:44,518 --> 00:00:46,121
I want to know whose it is.
The kid.

27
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:46,988
Jody's the father.

28
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,089
- I'm not my dad.
- Get out.

29
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:49,991
You hear me?
I'm not my fucking dad!

30
00:00:51,027 --> 00:00:54,062
- Hey.
- Hey.

31
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,430
You look great,
by the way.

32
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:02,452

You had late pick-ups
on Monday and Thursday.

55
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:22,962
That's an extra $16.

56
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,965
I wasn't that late.

57
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,002
Fiona would charge you $20.

00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:30,338
(beeping)

59
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:35,143
Come on.

60
00:02:35,178 --> 00:02:36,645
Jesus.

61
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:40,181
It's a wonder I got
here in one piece.

62
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,217
(groans)

63
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,989
You're looking for
the Sunshine Adult Day Care.

64
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:49,557
It's up at the church.

65
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,993
Honey, only time I want
to go to church is when

66
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:54,395
I feel like getting molested.

67
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:57,599
What do you want? A tip?

68
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:01,069
Who are you two supposed to be?

69
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:04,340
I'm Ethel, and this
is Jonah, my son.

70
00:03:04,374 --> 00:03:06,275
You look a little
crispy to be Liam.

71
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:08,344
- Oh, I'm Malik.
- Malik?

72
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:08,926
Yeah.

73
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:11,114
Jesus.
Enough with the fake African

74
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:13,617
spice rack crap.
A little advice?

75
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,020
Some people are racist. You
want to get ahead in the world?

76
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:19,623
Change your name so people
don't know you're black.

77
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,821
Honey, is that hot
water heater working?

78
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:24,528
Yeah.

79
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:27,397
Get me a towel.
I gotta have a bath.

80
00:03:27,432 --> 00:03:29,266
I'm sorry,
who are you?

81
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,702
I'm your grandmother,
sweetheart.

82
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,974
You Carl?

83
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,811
Get me a crowbar
and a hammer.

84
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:48,320
(flushes)

85
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:50,088
(Estefania speaking Portuguese)

86
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,490
I've got to run an errand.

87
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,991
(speaking Portuguese)
So...

88
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,628
Uh, lock the door,

89
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:57,230
and don't answer for anybody.

90
00:03:57,264 --> 00:03:58,631
Okay?

91
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:03,070
(speaking Portuguese)

92
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:07,475
If we were together
for 100 years,

93
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,876
I would never learn Portuguese.

94
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:13,648
Okay.

95
00:04:13,683 --> 00:04:16,518
Why are we bashing
a hole in the wall?

96
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:19,555
We're remodeling.
Where's the rest of the litter?

97
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:22,458
Ian's at work, we haven't
seen Lip for days,

98
00:04:22,492 --> 00:04:23,959
Liam's down in day care,

99
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:25,928
and Fiona's probably
trying to sleep.

100
00:04:25,962 --> 00:04:27,363
She works nights.

101
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,531
- What about Frank?
- Doesn't live here anymore.

102
00:04:29,566 --> 00:04:30,832
Good boy.

103
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,367
Now, out of the way.

104
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,213
- What's that?
- What's it look like?

105
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:46,015
- A finger.
- Ew.

106
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:52,956
You can touch it, but never
put your finger on the trigger

107
00:04:52,991 --> 00:04:54,892
unless you're going
to shoot someone.

108
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:56,260
You like secrets?

109
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,364
So do I. Hold out your hands.

110
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:06,136
Our little secret,
all right?

111
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:08,338
There are important
decisions to be made.

112
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:10,373
This much money comes with

113
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,208
- great responsibility.
- Frank... can you run downstairs

114
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:14,544
- and ask Jody for the paprika?
- Investments, trusts,

115
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:17,013
tax evasion, liquidity.

116
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:17,501
Frank.

117
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,315
As soon as Eddie's
insurance claim is settled

118
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,183
and that check comes, we're
gonna have to make some...

119
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:23,352
- Frank.
- What?

120
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:28,390
I can't let you be in charge
of Eddie's insurance money,

121
00:05:28,425 --> 00:05:30,726
sweetheart.

122
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,394
You're an alcoholic.

123
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:36,732
I wasn't talking about me.

124
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,034
- Okay.
- Did you think I meant me?

125
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:39,402
No.

126
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:42,672
We need a highly
experienced professional.

127
00:05:42,707 --> 00:05:45,208
- Yeah, that's right.
- And just for the record,

128
00:05:45,243 --> 00:05:47,077
many great men have
been well lubricated.

129
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,747
Henry Ford.
Scott Fitzgerald.

130
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:51,883
David Hasselhoff. They all
kept a bottle close.

131
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,451
Mom!

132
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:56,087
Beethoven's Fifth.
Coincidence? I don't think so.

133
00:05:56,121 --> 00:05:57,789
I think you should do these
in the bathroom.

134
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,090
Ooh...
Sheila, please...

135
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:00,691
No, we can just put
down newspaper, honey.

136
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:03,127
There are important economic
factors at play.

137
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:05,295
It's gonna smell!
Use the tub.

138
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,851
Did you bring in the
filleting knife,

139
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:07,931
Our family's financial...

140
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,199
and, the, uh,
mesh gloves?

141
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,367
...security is in the...
oh, fuck it.

142
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:12,768
I'll be at the office.

143
00:06:12,803 --> 00:06:15,804
Paprika?
(groans)

144
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:17,306
Um...

145
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,308
Honey, you know
what I was thinking?

146
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:22,978
Um, we could put
the food on the bed

147
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:25,648
and then do folding
chairs along the walls.

148
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:28,784
We can't hold a wedding
reception in your bedroom.

149
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:31,586
Honey, parties are
always in the living room.

150
00:06:31,621 --> 00:06:33,556
This would be unique.

151
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,257
This is the start
of my marriage.

152
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,659
It's important to me.

153
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:38,794
You can do it, Mom.

154
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:40,630
It's just going to
happen downstairs.

155
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:42,398
You know what?

156
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:46,034
I <i>am</i> going to do
the fish in the tub.

157
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:56,944
Whoever that is better
have a death wish.

158
00:06:56,978 --> 00:06:59,377
Sorry. Uh...
something's come up.

159
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,049
Grammy's back.

160
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,452
(doorbell rings)

161
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:10,019
(smacking lips)

162
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,755
Oh, hi.

163
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:12,990
Hi.
Uh...

164
00:07:13,024 --> 00:07:14,491
I'm looking for Tony.

165
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:18,060
Honey!
Just a sec.

166
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:20,696
(quietly):
Okay.

167
00:07:22,032 --> 00:07:24,200
She's nice, honey.

168
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,201
You got balls.

169
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,502
Coming back here.

170
00:07:27,537 --> 00:07:29,704
I brought you something.

171
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:31,272
I don't take bribes.

172
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:32,540
Dude, you're living in one.

173
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:35,377
Think of this
as a donation.

174
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:37,045
Policeman's Ball.

175
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:38,546
Tsunami relief.

176
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,314
End Autism Now.

177
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:43,250
It's your choice.

178
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,221
(sighs)

179
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:56,794
Motherfucker.

180
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:00,162
Who the hell let you
back in the country?

181
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,500
They were patting down a 90-year-old's
diaper, and I slipped by.

182
00:08:02,534 --> 00:08:04,001
Where the hell
have you been?

183
00:08:04,035 --> 00:08:05,235
Brazil.

184
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:07,704
You get the works
or just a tummy tuck?

185
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,571
Just a dick reduction;
still too big.

186
00:08:09,605 --> 00:08:10,019
Okay.

187
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,673
I see that Tony's
got a live-in, huh?

188
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:12,907
Yeah.

189
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,342
Second one this summer.

190
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:15,877
What do you want
with Tony?

191
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:17,378
Just family stuff.

192
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,480
Business, you know.

193
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:20,747
No, I don't know.

194
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:22,148
What kind
of business?

195
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,416
Morning.

196
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,518
Lip, where you been all night?
Grammy showed up.

197
00:08:25,552 --> 00:08:27,686
What, Joliet Grammy?
She tunnel out?

198
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,887
Medical furlough.

199
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,156
Wow.

200
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,857
- Hey, good luck.
- Yeah.

201
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,392
Grammy?

202
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,493
Frank's mom.

203
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:38,894
Ran a slew of meth labs
till one exploded,

204
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:40,896
killing two college kids
she'd recruited.

205
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:42,064
Whoa.

206
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:43,565
I see that, uh,

207
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,832
Tony's got a live-in, huh?

208
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:45,867
Seems so.

209
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,868
Yeah, they're
redecorating.

210
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,323
A little China cup.

211
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:51,338
Laotian, I think.

212
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:54,607
Yeah, see, I can never tell the
difference between the two.

213
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:58,577
We should get together, have
lunch, just... catch up.

214
00:08:58,611 --> 00:08:59,511
I'm seeing someone.

215
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:00,379
So am I.

216
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:01,580
Imported or domestic?

217
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:02,714
Import.

218
00:09:02,749 --> 00:09:04,449
Hey, we could bring them;
a double date.

219
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,084
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

220
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:08,086
I've already told
her all about you.

221
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:09,355
No, you haven't.

222
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,223
Well, I mean,
a bit about you.

223
00:09:11,258 --> 00:09:14,260
You know, I-I'm sure
that I have mentioned your name.

224
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:21,034
DEBBIE:
Oh, come on, don't freeze.

225
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:23,203
Please, don't freeze.

226
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,972
Jesus, we had better gear
than this piece of crap

227
00:09:26,006 --> 00:09:28,074
in prison.

228
00:09:29,576 --> 00:09:31,077
Okay, we're good.

229
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:34,913
Dr. Noah Pitts.

230
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:37,649
The Pitts Center
for Cosmetic Surgery.

231
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:40,318
Doctor, huh?

232
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:43,321
Well, he always
did know his drugs.

233
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,791
Same macroeconomic
headwinds, right?

234
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:49,061
So, how did they do a
$3 billion payback?

235
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:51,797
These investment banks,

236
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:55,501
we bail the fuckers out,
they don't loan a dime.

237
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,104
Just-just nod your head if any of this is
getting through to you.

238
00:09:58,138 --> 00:10:00,006
You know what? Forget all
of this; all you got to do

239
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,777
is wear a suit, yes,
and say "net, net"

240
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,345
and "economic indicators."
Say it a lot.

241
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,783
Jesus. They let you out?

242
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,619
Yeah. They let me out.

243
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,320
KEVIN:
Surprised to see you, Peg.

244
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:14,657
Thought you were doing
20 to life.

245
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,792
Tricked them into
thinking I was dying.

246
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:18,193
So they let me out early.

247
00:10:18,228 --> 00:10:20,429
Gin neat.

248
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,097
And something sweet
for the kid.

249
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:23,999
Thanks for the push.

250
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,468
What are you
doing here?

251
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:28,037
I'm conducting
the Chicago Symphony.

252
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:31,374
Frankie, what do you
think I'm doing?

253
00:10:32,909 --> 00:10:35,711
(exhales)

254
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:37,612
Now, buy your mother a drink

255
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:40,149
and pretend like
you're glad to see me.

256
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:47,457
Oh, Jesus.

257
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:56,901
What's up
with you and Ian?

258
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:01,006
Did he say something
about Karen?

259
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,314
She's married.

260
00:11:08,348 --> 00:11:10,883
You're skipping the
wedding reception, I hope?

261
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:12,551
Wasn't invited.

262
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:16,822
She moved on.

263
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:19,491
Hope you see the irony

264
00:11:19,526 --> 00:11:21,260
in you giving
relationship advice.

265
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,363
Grammy staying?

266
00:11:24,397 --> 00:11:26,732
You want to tell her to leave?

267
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,234
Guess we'd better steal

268
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,369
some fire extinguishers
from the school, then.

269
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,574
Make it right with Ian.

270
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,042
You two are my rocks.

271
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:40,277
I can't do it
without you.

272
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:53,291
One more.

273
00:11:53,326 --> 00:11:56,261
That bastard Noah
dropped a dime on me.

274
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,363
No, he didn't.

275
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:00,598
Then how'd the cops know
about the meth lab?

276
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,700
I don't know--
the explosion?

277
00:12:02,734 --> 00:12:04,602
We're going to take
a little road trip

278
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,604
to see my old friend Pitts.

279
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,239
You bring your car
around tomorrow,

280
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,473
6:00 a.m. sharp.

281
00:12:09,508 --> 00:12:10,808
I don't have a car.

282
00:12:10,843 --> 00:12:12,443
Christ, you're pathetic.

283
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,911
You bed-wetting excuse
for a son.

284
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:16,713
Can I borrow your truck?

285
00:12:16,748 --> 00:12:18,648
- Not a chance.
- It's for me.

286
00:12:18,683 --> 00:12:20,317
I need to see
a doctor.

287
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,585
Oh.

288
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,953
Take the bus.

289
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,223
(sighs)

290
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,125
Jesus. Don't worry.

291
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,028
We'll bring it back
with a full tank.

292
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:33,165
- A double date?
- I know.

293
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,900
(beeps)

294
00:12:34,935 --> 00:12:36,469
You gonna go?

295
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,471
Ah, sending a signal.

296
00:12:38,505 --> 00:12:39,939
Yeah, what's that?

297
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:42,007
I still want to sit
on your face.

298
00:12:42,042 --> 00:12:44,243
- So you wouldn't go?
- Hell, yeah, I'd go.

299
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:46,411
I got to see what
the new bitch looks like.

300
00:12:46,446 --> 00:12:48,981
- Who you gonna take?
- Adam, I guess.

301
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,682
Oh, really? The Boy Scout?

302
00:12:50,717 --> 00:12:52,784
- Richard?
- Ugh!

303
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:54,319
The old guy
from the wedding? No.

304
00:12:54,353 --> 00:12:56,521
- Steve's new girl is hot?
- Probably.

305
00:12:56,555 --> 00:12:58,022
You're going to look
like easy pickings

306
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,290
for something
on the side.

307
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:00,525
It's not going
to happen.

308
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,859
Oh, like
Craig Heisner

309
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,761
wasn't going
to happen?

310
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,335
(train clanking and screeching)

311
00:13:13,804 --> 00:13:15,505
Frank?

312
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:16,773
Huh?

313
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,942
What?

314
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:22,145
You wet the bed.

315
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:27,150
Oh. Sorry.

316
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:55,510
Grammy's back.

317
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:59,147
Just showed up,
in an ambulance.

318
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,417
You know, she, uh...

319
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,852
she didn't even call.

320
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,524
How fucked-up
is that, huh?

321
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,430
That's it?

322
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,669
Nothing?

323
00:14:21,703 --> 00:14:24,605
You just gonna give me the chin?

324
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,885
How about now?

325
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,520
No?

326
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,328
Really? Still nothing?

327
00:14:50,633 --> 00:14:52,233
No?!

328
00:15:05,915 --> 00:15:07,483
GRAMMY:
Frank here?

329
00:15:07,517 --> 00:15:09,785
Yeah.

330
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:11,086
Thanks for
the push, Carl.

331
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,454
My five bucks.

332
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:14,156
Hey.

333
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,158
I gave you
$60 yesterday.

334
00:15:16,192 --> 00:15:17,792
Don't get greedy.

335
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,728
Who is it?
Someone for Frank.

336
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:23,132
Peggy Gallagher.

337
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,534
Frank's mom.

338
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,637
Oh... my goodness!

339
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,973
Oh, come in,
come in,

340
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:31,108
come in!

341
00:15:31,142 --> 00:15:32,242
Oh...

342
00:15:32,277 --> 00:15:33,377
You coming down?

343
00:15:34,446 --> 00:15:36,014
I just woke up.

344
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,849
Look at me!
Darn it, um,

345
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:38,916
you caught us.

346
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,118
Uh, Frank?

347
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:41,352
He's still sleeping.

348
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:42,620
Oh...

349
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:45,323
you did such a wonderful job
raising that boy.

350
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:46,990
He's just so clean

351
00:15:47,025 --> 00:15:48,091
and so...

352
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:49,626
No, he's not clean.

353
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,660
I mean, um...

354
00:15:50,694 --> 00:15:52,328
Uh, Frank...!

355
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:54,964
Frank?

356
00:15:54,998 --> 00:15:56,732
Frank? Frank?

357
00:15:57,568 --> 00:15:59,669
Frank, guess who's here.

358
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:01,871
What are you doing?

359
00:16:01,906 --> 00:16:03,540
Drying the sheets.

360
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:06,277
Frank, why didn't you tell me
that your mother was coming?

361
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:07,444
Jody and I

362
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:08,946
could have made

366

You sounded upset
over the phone.

367
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:26,530
WOMAN:
Ethel.

368
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,700
ETHEL:
Constance, Abigail,

369
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,702
- Ruth, Sarah?
- KEVIN: Ethel,

370
00:16:31,736 --> 00:16:34,038
your <i>sister wives</i>
have some news.

371
00:16:34,072 --> 00:16:35,573
Our husband Clyde

372
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:37,842
was murdered in the
American prison.

373
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:44,582
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

374
00:16:44,616 --> 00:16:46,217
I will fear no evil, for thou
art with me; thy rod and thy...

375
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,916
All right, will you
please cut that out?

376
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,987
I'm not even sure it's
allowed for you to be here.

377
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:51,844
We're working to bring you home.

378
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:52,656
She <i>is</i> home.

379
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,892
She was forced
into sexual slavery.

380
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,894
She married joyfully
of her own free will.

381
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,095
She was 11!

382
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,164
We've hired attorneys;
you'll be home soon,

383
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:03,034

384
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:08,774
Oh. Here is me

385
00:17:08,809 --> 00:17:10,209

My pony!

386
00:17:10,243 --> 00:17:11,878
Oh...

387
00:17:11,912 --> 00:17:13,279

388
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,715
I was riding him and
I thought he just tripped,

389
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:17,383
but he never got up.

390
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:18,785

391

410
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,456

Off-the-chart smart.

425

Good genes.

426
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,806
And Ian's a real lady killer,

427
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,938

age, you remember?

428

Gets that from
her mother.

431

Carl's into karate,

entrepreneurial spirit.

a suit like that?

Wait for Barney's

459

Actually, Adam is
an investment banker.

Oh, well, it's nice to put a
face to all that bailout money.

Yeah.

476
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:34,783
(door opens)
Boys' room is next-door.

477
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,752
Okay, I was helping
out a Brazilian friend

00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:39,609
with a small import-export
business down in Sao Paulo.

479

You're married?

480
00:20:40,923 --> 00:20:42,891
Her father was a competitor
and didn't appreciate our entry

481
00:20:42,925 --> 00:20:45,060
into an already
crowded market.
You were smuggling cars?

482
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,462
The product
isn't important.

483
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,797
He cut my friend's ear off...

485

daughter into the States.

Dad's very old-fashioned, okay?

488

00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,460
are gonna try and take Ethel
and Jonah away from us.

542
00:23:22,495 --> 00:23:23,762
They can't just take them, Kev.

543
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:25,564
I think we should
adopt them.

544
00:23:25,598 --> 00:23:28,066
I love 'em, too,
but we get paid to love 'em.

545
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,802
We adopt 'em, we love
'em on our own dime.

546
00:23:29,836 --> 00:23:31,436
What sense does that make?

547
00:23:31,471 --> 00:23:32,671
They were scary, V.

548
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:33,973
All dressed in
black and shit.

549
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:37,510
And the alpha witch
was, like... Whoa.

550
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:39,579
I'm talking
serious evil.

551
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,280
- Now they have lawyers.
- They can't do anything.

552
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:42,139
The State has custody.

553
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,350
They're not just gonna give
them back to the Waco wackos.

554
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,585
They're not evil.

555
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:48,987
They're my family.

556
00:23:51,725 --> 00:23:54,359
Hi. I'm Dr. Pitts,
Mrs. Macgillicuddy.

557
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:57,996
I see you're thinking
about breast augmentation.

558
00:23:58,031 --> 00:24:02,034
I was thinking
about the $200,000 you owe me.

559
00:24:02,068 --> 00:24:05,204
I'm definitely getting
my tits done.

560
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:06,604
You got out early.

561
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:08,006
Yeah.

562
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,774
I only did 12 years.

563
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:11,442
Isn't that swell?

564
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,612
Pretty woman.
Your wife?

565
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:15,213
Two little girls.

566
00:24:15,248 --> 00:24:16,681
Adorable.

567
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,718
Any of them know
you used to be a meth dealer?

568
00:24:21,087 --> 00:24:22,821
I don't want
to keep you, Doctor.

569
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:26,458
I know you've got a waiting room
full of frozen faces.

570
00:24:26,492 --> 00:24:29,961
So, the 200 thou that's
no longer in the deposit box,

571
00:24:29,996 --> 00:24:32,564
that was mine, is now where?

572
00:24:32,598 --> 00:24:33,560
Okay, don't threaten me.

573
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,568
I'm not some naive college kid from
Grand Rapids that you can intimidate.

574
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:38,036
Where's my money, Noah?

575
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:39,504
Fine. You went to
prison, you got out.

576
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,539
But you can't just waltz
in here expecting me

577
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:42,697
to cough up 200 grand.

578
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,076
The Pitts Medical Center?

579
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,244
I just finished my residency.
I'm in debt up to my ass!

580
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:50,348
We had a deal about what
would happen if shit went down,

581
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:53,484
and when shit went down,
you ran.

582
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,254
All right, I'll pay you back,
but it's gonna take some time.

583
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:00,390
That's the one thing
I don't have, my friend.

584
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:01,858
Tomorrow. All of it.

585
00:25:01,892 --> 00:25:03,626
No. I can't do it.

586
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:10,533
You don't want to leave it
like this, Noah.

587
00:25:15,072 --> 00:25:17,741
He gonna pay you?

588
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:19,442
This tastes like shit.

589
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:21,511
I shouldn't have gotten
the praline.

590
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:23,614
What's he owe you?

591
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,349
What'd you get,
the Captain's Swirl?

592
00:25:25,383 --> 00:25:27,050
I think I got a right to know.

593
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:28,785
I'm involved now.

594
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,192
Here, trade with me.

595
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:32,388
What? No! What are you doing?

596
00:25:32,422 --> 00:25:33,981
What's the difference?
Trade with me!

597
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:34,924
I don't like praline!

598
00:25:34,958 --> 00:25:36,959
Come on!
No, I want mine!

599
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,228
- Mom, I want... I...
- I'm your mother!

600
00:25:39,262 --> 00:25:41,564
Oh, Jesus! Take
'em both, then!

601
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:46,469
It's my truck.

602
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,870
It's not your truck.

603
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,905
It's traditional.

604
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,375
The driver gets a share,
he's a partner.

605
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,812
Son...

606
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:57,281
don't flatter yourself.

607
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,895
Usually there's some kind
of dollar amount per mile.

608
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:13,832
Shut up and look
for these two.

609
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:20,071
You're kidnapping
his kids?!

610
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:21,606
Are you insane?!

611
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,642
That's federal,
that's a federal...

612
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:26,111
Keep your damn voice down.

613
00:26:27,313 --> 00:26:29,148
Hold on.

614
00:26:29,182 --> 00:26:31,550
How much money are
we talking about?

615
00:26:34,021 --> 00:26:35,822
You okay?

616
00:26:35,856 --> 00:26:38,358
You look
kind of white.

617
00:26:38,393 --> 00:26:41,928
I think I... just
stood up too fast.

618
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:43,496
(sighs)

619
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:44,864
Mom?

620
00:26:44,898 --> 00:26:47,300
Just give me a
goddamn minute.

621
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:48,867
You want some water
or something?

622
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:51,269
I'm gonna... I'm gonna
go get you some water.

623
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:53,771
No. No.

624
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:58,208
Shit!

625
00:26:58,243 --> 00:26:59,944
Go get this refilled.

626
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:03,814
I'm gonna sit here
and do some recon.

627
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:06,550
(loud chatter of children)

628
00:27:06,585 --> 00:27:08,619
Uh...
What?

629
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:11,222
I... I loaned Sheila

630
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:13,991
the last of the cash.

631
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:17,628
All my life,
I waited for that phone call.

632
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:20,030
"Peggy, he's
not your son.

633
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:23,866
There's been a mix-up
at the hospital."

634
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:27,203
It never came.

635
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,772
(sighs)

636
00:27:32,608 --> 00:27:34,242
All right, let's see.

637
00:27:34,276 --> 00:27:37,311
Oh, yeah, this is healing
really nicely.

638
00:27:37,345 --> 00:27:38,846
Very nicely.

639
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,050
I just need a sec with the doc.
Those look very real.

640
00:27:42,084 --> 00:27:45,053
Jesus. So sorry.

641
00:27:47,223 --> 00:27:49,058
Jesus, Frank.

642
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:51,193
I'm flattered you remembered
my name, 'cause

643
00:27:51,228 --> 00:27:53,329
I didn't remember
yours. So...

644
00:27:53,364 --> 00:27:55,599
time's up. I'm
here for the money.

645
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,101
She gave me until tomorrow.

646
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,336
Well, I don't think you
want to wait till then,

647
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:01,171
'cause she's about
to kidnap your kids.

648
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:03,173
Go Wolverines!

649
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,676
Hey, hey, hey, don't
you give <i>me</i> that look.

650
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,678
Try growing up with
her, coming home

651
00:28:07,712 --> 00:28:10,680
to <i>that</i> every day after
school. You think I'm joking?

652
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,949
She sent me out
for chloroform and duct tape.

653
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:13,969
Seriously, Doc,

654
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,520
I don't think you know who
you're dealing with here.

655
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:18,954
(clicks tongue)

656
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,759
No. I know exactly who
I'm dealing with.

657
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:27,598
75. That's all I've got.

658
00:28:27,632 --> 00:28:30,735
I've kept that
and these fake passports in here

659
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,570
in case she ever ratted me out

660
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:34,706
for a reduced sentence.

661
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,242
But this puts an end to it.

662
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,145
And if she ever comes near me
or my family again,

663
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:40,880
I'm going directly
to the police.

664
00:28:40,915 --> 00:28:43,115
You tell your mother that
she better think long and hard,

665
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,584
what we know about each other.

666
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:49,789
Okay?

667
00:28:49,823 --> 00:28:52,959
You don't have to go someplace
you don't want to.

668
00:28:52,993 --> 00:28:54,561
I don't have a choice.

669
00:28:54,595 --> 00:28:55,929
I'm a ward
of the state.

670
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:58,331
Well, what happens
if they send you back?

671
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,634
They'll find
me a husband.

672
00:29:00,668 --> 00:29:03,636
- Clyde has a brother.
- A brother?

673
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:04,637
How old is he?

674
00:29:04,672 --> 00:29:06,473
Caleb's much younger.

675
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:08,008
65 maybe?

676
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,843
He's very nice.

677
00:29:09,877 --> 00:29:13,013
They're my family, Malik.

678
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,848
You're not a little kid
anymore.

679
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:16,482
You're 14.

680
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:19,986
You have to decide
what's best for you and Jonah.

681
00:29:24,658 --> 00:29:25,925
Where'd you go,

682
00:29:25,959 --> 00:29:28,328
Philadelphia?

683
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:32,298
I spotted the
older girl.

684
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:35,969
Nanny dropped her off
in a stupid fucking Smart Car.

685
00:29:36,003 --> 00:29:37,670
Piece of cake.

686
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:41,140
Mama, I went back
and talked to Pitts.

687
00:29:41,174 --> 00:29:43,275
You what?
I'm trying to help!

688
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,812
If you got caught,
you'd die in prison. Here.

689
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:48,380
$50,000. Take it.

690
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,683
And if you think it's right,

691
00:29:50,717 --> 00:29:54,252
you can give me a cut, but
only if you think it's right.

692
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:58,357
You're amazing, Frank.

693
00:29:58,391 --> 00:30:01,794
I was gonna get 200,

694
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:04,229
and you were able to
talk him down to 50.

695
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:09,101
Well done, fruit
of my loins.

696
00:30:13,741 --> 00:30:15,208
Married?

697
00:30:15,242 --> 00:30:16,809
Yeah, to some teenager
from Brazil.

698
00:30:16,844 --> 00:30:18,211
- She cute?
- Very.

699
00:30:18,245 --> 00:30:19,646
Who's cute?

700
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,348
Chicken in the bucket.

701
00:30:21,382 --> 00:30:23,249
Steve's back, married to
some South American teenager.

702
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:25,685
- Really?
- So, what did Adam do?

703
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,354
Took off, left me there.

704
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,857
Can't blame him.
How's Ethel doing?

705
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:32,259
She's in shock,
I think. Poor thing.

706
00:30:32,294 --> 00:30:33,694
Husband murdered
in prison.

707
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,396
Ooh. Who got murdered?

708
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,997
- Ethel's husband, Clyde.
- Hmm.

709
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:37,338
Cool.

710
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:40,034
VERONICA: Kev thinks the State
might send her back to that cult,

711
00:30:40,068 --> 00:30:41,435
now that her sclerotic
husband is dead.

712
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,104
Grammy still here?

713
00:30:43,138 --> 00:30:45,940
Uh-uh. Left with Frank.

714
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,775
Somewhere in Chicago,
a priest is being mugged.

715
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:51,279
FIONA:
Lip, there's chicken.

716
00:30:56,151 --> 00:30:58,419
Still?

717
00:30:58,453 --> 00:30:59,953
What's that all about?

718
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,254
Karen, I think.

719
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,624
Will this summer ever end?

720
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,068
50 grand, huh?

721
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:17,238
Not bad for a day's work.

722
00:31:17,272 --> 00:31:19,407
(screaming)

723
00:31:19,441 --> 00:31:20,809
Jesus! Mommy!

724
00:31:20,843 --> 00:31:23,745
Give me the rest of it.
(yelling)

725
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:26,114
Oh, stop your squealing,
you little baby.

726
00:31:26,148 --> 00:31:28,951
I barely broke the skin.
Give me the rest of the money.

727
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:31,988
Oh, Jesus!
Take it!

728
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:34,557
(grunts)
What is this, another ten?

729
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,927
Is this all?

730
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,031
Oh, fuck!

731
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,635
I deserve something!

732
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,904
It's tradition!
Is this all of it?

733
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,107
Yes. Yes!

734
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,310
I'm bleeding all over
Kevin's truck! Shit!

735
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,846
Oh, damn it to hell.

736
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,015
You got me going again.

737
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,485
Give me my prescription.

738
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:05,857
Oh, don't stab me
again, okay?!

739
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:32,517
(crowd chatter)

740
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:34,352
(laughter)

741
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:36,154
(indistinct chatter)

742
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:40,357
Don't call her by name,
and listen, just...

743
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:42,226
you know what to do.

744
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,462
I'll give you your cues, you
just be sort of authoritative.

745
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,864
What's with this
thing? (laughs)

746
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:48,832
I got it.
It's good.

747
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,179
He's doing, like, an urban
version of a tuxedo.

748
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,534
Nice, Jody!

749
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,469
Right? William,

750
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,038
what was the name
of that guy?

751
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,841
He was saying how this much
money can shock your system.

752
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,576
Who was that guy?

753
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,045
Guy inherited a little over
a million, destroyed his life.

754
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,248
Family-- vultures.

755
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,483
Lost his wife,
his health.

756
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:07,251
Ended up giving the money
to an orphanage.

757
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:09,320
Now, William
was saying

758
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:12,657
you and I together
could form a trust.

759
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,659
I think that's
a very good idea, Frank.

760
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:15,894
We should just

761
00:33:15,928 --> 00:33:17,396
give our money

762
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,664
to an orphanage.

763
00:33:18,698 --> 00:33:20,333
No, babe,
you misunderstood me.

764
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:21,541
That's not saying
giving it to...

765
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,935
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

766
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:25,438
There's just a lot of,
um, people here,

767
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:27,006
so maybe I...

768
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,508
I think I just left
something upstairs.

769
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,410
I...

770
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,845
Okay.

771
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,347
We'll talk about
this later.

772
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:34,782
William will be here.

773
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,417
Nice work, Billy,
jump in any time.

774
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:37,685
VERONICA:
<i>I'm telling you, you can't turn</i>

775
00:33:37,719 --> 00:33:38,886
a whore into a housewife.

776
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,121
(laughs)

777
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:43,624
Wow, she's gorgeous.

778
00:33:48,229 --> 00:33:50,530
Debs.

779
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:51,224
Wow.

780
00:33:51,225 --> 00:33:53,866
Heard you were back
in town, Jimmy.

781
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,301
- Is this <i>otra prima?</i>
- You look great.

782
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:56,635
Where'd you get
that dress?

783
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,036
Oh, and married.

784
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:59,904
H-How's, uh,
how's school?

785
00:33:59,939 --> 00:34:00,972
It's summer.

786
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:02,540
Right, right, right.

787
00:34:02,575 --> 00:34:03,808
She's over you.

788
00:34:03,843 --> 00:34:05,243
Really, you sure
about that?

789
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:08,980
Mm-hmm, absolutely.

790
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,220
You really did him
in the bathroom?

791
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:16,788
No, I didn't.

792
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:17,324
Oh, thanks, V.

793
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:19,886
- You said she did him in the bathroom.
- I said she almost did.

794
00:34:19,887 --> 00:34:21,827
Why'd you have to
tell him anything?

795
00:34:21,861 --> 00:34:23,061
She's my wife; she
has to tell me.

796
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:24,896
Hey, I don't have
to tell you shit.

797
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,798
(scoffs)

798
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,466
- KAREN: Hey, you okay?
- Yes.

799
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:32,570
Certainly are a lot
of people down there.

800
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,571
You're doing
great, Mom.

801
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:34,839
Yeah.

802
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,508
Yeah, sweetie,
I know.

803
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:37,809
Now, you can't drink
on your medication.

804
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:39,277
I know. You know what?
I just wanted

805
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,580
to hold this to make other
people feel comfortable

806
00:34:41,614 --> 00:34:43,482
'cause I don't want
them to think...

807
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:43,949
Right.

808
00:34:43,984 --> 00:34:44,284
So happy.

809
00:34:44,285 --> 00:34:45,251
So you go, sweetie, go on.

810
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,986
- Okay.
- Everything's fine.

811
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:49,256
You look beautiful.

812
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,592
- Thank you.
- I love you.

813
00:34:51,626 --> 00:34:52,993
I love you.

814
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:55,629
(gasps)

815
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:06,640
Whoo!

816
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,977
Once more into the breech.

817
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:31,663
What, you don't get enough
abuse just being Frank's son?

818
00:35:31,698 --> 00:35:32,631
What? I wanted
to congratulate

819
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:34,633
the, uh,
happy couple.

820
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,235
Jesus, you smell
like a brewery.

821
00:35:36,269 --> 00:35:37,470
It's hair of the dog.

822
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:38,971
Go home, Lip, please.

823
00:35:39,005 --> 00:35:41,373
Uh, whoa, Jameson-- that's
not gonna last long.

824
00:35:41,407 --> 00:35:45,310
FRANK: That's, that's why I'm
leaning towards hedge funds.

825
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,878
You're betting it'll go up

826
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:49,480
<i>and</i> you're betting
that they'll go down.

827
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,015
It's like if the Cubs won

828
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:53,150
the World Series
and the world ended

829
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,218
all in one day.

830
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,219
Fill her up,

831
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,220
Grammy?

832
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,487
You 21?

833
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,921
In four years.

834
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,356
Or gold, or gold.

835
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,624
It never goes down.

836
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,260
What?

837
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,830
What is she doing here?

838
00:36:07,865 --> 00:36:09,165
FRANK: Oh, there's free
food and booze.

839
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,333
Mom won't miss that.

840
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:12,902
I don't care, I don't
want her in my house.

841
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:13,669
Get her out of here.

842
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:15,404
- I can't do that.
- Why?

843
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:19,107
Because she would slaughter me
and feast on my flesh.

844
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:20,108
What?

845
00:36:20,142 --> 00:36:21,109
What are you doing here?

846
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:22,177
Brought a
Cuisinart.

847
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:25,914
(speaking Portuguese)

848
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:27,716
Yeah, no, of course, yeah.

849
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,137
Hi.

850
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:29,685
Hey, listen, about
the bathroom...

851
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:31,520
Nothing happened
in the bathroom.

852
00:36:31,555 --> 00:36:33,589
Well, whatever didn't happen
in the bathroom, I'm sorry.

853
00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:35,690
What didn't happen in
the bathroom, Steve,

854
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:36,459
did not happen.

855
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,863
(glass clinking)

856
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,531
Quiet, please.

857
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,466
JODY:
Quiet, everyone.

858
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:47,036
I'm sorry that I didn't make it all
the way down the stairs today,

859
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,438
but baby steps.

860
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:52,241
That's right, Mom.
(Sheila sighs)

861
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,543
Oh, my Karen, my baby,

862
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:56,645
all grown up.
I so wish

863
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,547
your father
could have been here today.

864
00:36:59,582 --> 00:37:01,482
I wish
he could have seen you,

865
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:04,619
our sweet girl, all grown up,

866
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:07,555
and I know
he would be so proud

867
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,393
of his grandbaby, no matter who
the father was-- except Frank.

868
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:12,661
(laughing
nervously)

869
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:14,229
He hated Frank.

870
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:15,564
But it couldn't
be Frank

871
00:37:15,598 --> 00:37:17,766
because there wasn't
any penetration.

872
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,236
Eddie didn't like
being penetrated.

873
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,771
He had
a funny bump

874
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,106
on the side of his penis
that we thought

875
00:37:25,141 --> 00:37:27,075
was cancer,
but it turned out

876
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,277
I was just being
too rough on him.

877
00:37:28,311 --> 00:37:30,479
So there's been
some obstacles

878
00:37:30,513 --> 00:37:32,648
and some pitfalls,

879
00:37:32,682 --> 00:37:34,283
but she's made
some wonderful,

880
00:37:34,317 --> 00:37:38,287
wonderful friends
along the way, like Lip...

881
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,589
(mouthing) ...and all
the Gallaghers--

882
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:42,858
people I just used
to only know

883
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,094
as the ones
in that house

884
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:46,691
where the cops always came.

885
00:37:46,692 --> 00:37:49,666
Jesus, is that bitch
ever going to shut up?

886
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:50,968
SHEILA:
And Frank's mother.

887
00:37:52,304 --> 00:37:53,537
We're just so honored

888
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,973
that you're here,
even though

889
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,875
you weren't even invited--

890
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,710
and not really honored
because

891
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,146
you're a convicted felon.

892
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:03,714
But you're out
now, aren't you?

893
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,282
Why, why did they let you out?

894
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:08,352
'Cause you're a loud,
mean, vicious bitch.

895
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:08,933
Oh.

896
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:11,121
Okay, Mom, let's open presents.

897
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,456
Why don't you do yourself
and everyone else a favor

898
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,724
and shut up?

899
00:38:14,758 --> 00:38:16,892
Have I offended you
in my home

900
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,327
where you're an interloper?

901
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:21,163
No one wants to hear it,
you fucking windbag.

902
00:38:21,197 --> 00:38:22,732
Okay, Mom, let's
go upstairs.

903
00:38:22,766 --> 00:38:24,633
She called me
a Wacker Drive whore.

904
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,634
Frank.

905
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:26,869
Oh, let 'em work it out.

906
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,871
And I don't know how an angel

907
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:32,174
like that man could have come
out of your poisoned womb.

908
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,310
Shut up, you batty bitch.

909
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,412
You know what?
You've got

910
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,015
a demon mind and a devil's womb

911
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,083
and heart,

912
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,651
and your coochie smells

913
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,986
of brimstone

914
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,254
and sulfur!

915
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,056
I will fuck you up!

916
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,324
Shit.
Oh, shit!

917
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,893
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Do it, do it!

918

FRANK:

920
00:38:58,704 --> 00:39:00,671
There's a woman with a gun.

She's at a party,
she's shooting people.

Yes, yes!

Whoa, Officer Markovich
on the scene.

927
00:39:21,298 --> 00:39:23,299
Sorry about that, guys.

LIP:
You okay?

935
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:50,544
How do you like
my party so far?

936
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:52,313
I'm kind of digging it,
you know,

937
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:55,083
it's got
a certain energy.

938
00:39:56,418 --> 00:39:59,388
So, the little missus.

939
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:03,225
Got your Cuisinart,
baby on the way.

940
00:40:03,259 --> 00:40:06,528
Yep, I'm the
American Dream.

941
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:08,163
You are,

942
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:13,101
except, uh, Doofus is your
husband and that's my baby.

943
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:16,962
So, what, do you
want it on weekends?

944
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:19,497
Want to run away together,
get a double-wide?

945
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:24,149
No.

946
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:28,163
I want you to get
an abortion.

947
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:39,675

KEVIN:
Hey, Ethel, you decent?

949
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:43,414
Um, uh, just a minute.

950
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:54,859
Okay, come in.

951
00:40:56,794 --> 00:40:58,863
Hey. Is he sleeping?

952
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:00,431
Okay.

953
00:41:00,466 --> 00:41:02,100
I just wanted to make sure
you're doing all right.

954
00:41:02,134 --> 00:41:04,435
I'm fine, thank you.

955
00:41:07,473 --> 00:41:09,674
Look, I know
you're sad and stuff,

956
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,177
but I want you to know
that you can talk to us.

957
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:13,478
All right?

958
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,548
We're here for you
if you need us.

959
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:20,452
How was
the party?

960
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:21,619
It was good.

961
00:41:21,654 --> 00:41:22,988
No one got hit.

962
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:26,290
They have to replace
the smoke detector.

963
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:28,325
But everybody was asking
about you, though,

964
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:32,429
where you were,
where Baby Jonah was.

965
00:41:33,497 --> 00:41:36,733
So... good night, then.

966
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,534
Good night.

967
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:40,169
Mr. Kevin.

968
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:42,138
Yeah.

969
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:43,973
Thank you.

970
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:46,709
For what?

971
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,779
For everything.

972
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:55,818
You're welcome.

973
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,100
(snoring)

974
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,097
(snoring
continues)

975
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:05,486
(door opens)

976
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,058
Hey.

977
00:43:10,092 --> 00:43:11,292
(grunts)
Hey.

978
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,562
What's up?

979
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:17,298
Are we going shopping
for school clothes today?

980
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,299
(grunts)

981
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:19,734
Day care.

982
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,069
After?

983
00:43:21,103 --> 00:43:22,337
Did I commit
to that?

984
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,438
Yep.

985
00:43:23,472 --> 00:43:25,340
Then, yes.

986
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,010
(sighs)

987
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:33,449
What?

988
00:43:33,484 --> 00:43:35,351
Was it weird
seeing Jimmy?

989
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:36,953
Jimmy?

990
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:39,522
Steve.

991
00:43:39,557 --> 00:43:41,124
Jimmy.

992
00:43:41,158 --> 00:43:42,926
Who's Jimmy?

993
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,927
Jimmy lives in
Lake Forrest

994
00:43:44,962 --> 00:43:47,264
with his doctor father
and drunk mother.

995
00:43:47,298 --> 00:43:48,999
They think he goes
to medical school

996
00:43:49,033 --> 00:43:51,334
at the University
of Michigan.

997
00:43:51,368 --> 00:43:53,402
Yeah, and...?

998
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,672
Jimmy is Steve.

999
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:03,112
KEVIN:
V, they're gone!

1000
00:44:03,146 --> 00:44:05,114
What?
Ethel and Jonah.

1001
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:06,910
Well, maybe they went over
to the day care early.

1002
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,395
No, all their stuff is gone--

1003
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,186
his clothes, her
suitcase-- gone!

1004
00:44:10,221 --> 00:44:12,489
What?

1005
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,692
(upbeat music plays on TV)

1006
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:23,634
GRAMMY:
We a little mopey this morning?

1007
00:44:23,668 --> 00:44:25,335
No.

1008
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:27,904
You're thinking just because
Carl got something,

1009
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:30,206
maybe you should get something?

1010
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,841
No.

1011
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:34,243
Well, maybe
if you freshen up my coffee

1012
00:44:34,277 --> 00:44:35,844
and give your Grammy a kiss,

1013
00:44:35,878 --> 00:44:38,279
things will start
looking up for you.

1014
00:44:55,698 --> 00:44:58,033
For me?

1015
00:44:58,068 --> 00:45:00,102
- Yeah.
- Oh, Grammy!

1016
00:45:00,136 --> 00:45:02,671
Thank you! Thank you!

1017
00:45:02,706 --> 00:45:04,573
Hey, Jimmy,
it's Fiona.

1018
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:07,176
I just wanted to say,
go fuck yourself!

1019
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:10,512
- What's all this?
- DEBBIE: A new laptop.

1020
00:45:10,547 --> 00:45:12,114
This is so awesome!

1021
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:13,348
Christmas in August?

1022
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:14,683
Ethel and Jonah are gone.

1023
00:45:14,717 --> 00:45:16,017
FIONA:
What?

1024
00:45:16,052 --> 00:45:17,519
Did she say anything
to you, Debbie?

1025
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:17,886
No.

1026
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,265
What about Malik?
What time does he show up?

1027
00:45:20,266 --> 00:45:21,255
In about an hour.

1028
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,256
You sure they didn't
just sleep

1029
00:45:22,291 --> 00:45:23,858
at their grandparents
or something?

1030
00:45:23,893 --> 00:45:25,120
Ethel packed everything.
Baby's stuff, too.

1031
00:45:25,121 --> 00:45:27,429
Okay. She's 14 years old with an infant.
How far can she get?

1032
00:45:27,464 --> 00:45:29,531
She doesn't
have any money.

1033
00:45:29,566 --> 00:45:30,946
It was those evil Jesus witches!

1034
00:45:30,947 --> 00:45:32,110
They took 'em. I know it!

1035
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,880
We should call the
social worker,

1036
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:35,806
see if she can get
the cops looking.

1037
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,207
If she shows up,
call us right away.

1038
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:38,576
Perfect. I'm solo today,

1039
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,911
and we've got a full
house for day care.

1040
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,147
I'll help you, honey.

1041
00:45:43,181 --> 00:45:46,483
Can we talk about these gifts?

1042
00:45:46,517 --> 00:45:49,219
You think I'm trying
to buy their affection?

1043
00:45:49,253 --> 00:45:52,055
Well, it's certainly
for sale.

1044
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:55,725
I just had some money from
an old business arrangement,

1045
00:45:55,759 --> 00:45:58,160
and I thought I'd spread it
around a bit.

1046
00:45:59,763 --> 00:46:02,097
You didn't come

1047
00:46:02,132 --> 00:46:04,166
to see me
when I was in prison.

1048
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,070
I was 11 when you went in.

1049
00:46:07,104 --> 00:46:10,007
I... hardly knew you.

1050
00:46:10,041 --> 00:46:13,176
Well, that's my fault, I guess.

1051
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:21,754
500 bucks.

1052
00:46:21,788 --> 00:46:23,155
Figure,
from what I've seen

1053
00:46:23,189 --> 00:46:24,990
around here so far,
you need it more

1054
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:26,858
than some digital shit
that's gonna be obsolete

1055
00:46:26,893 --> 00:46:29,094
before you can
get it out of the box.

1056
00:46:29,128 --> 00:46:32,364
It's not a bribe, Fiona.

1057
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:36,168
I've got some serious
Grammy time

1058
00:46:36,202 --> 00:46:39,505
to make up for around here.

1059
00:46:46,047 --> 00:46:47,648
Oh, my.

1060
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:49,650
What?

1061
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:52,620
It's from Eddie's
life insurance company.

1062
00:46:52,654 --> 00:46:54,122
The check came?

1063
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:56,124
Oh, my.

1064
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,793
Stop saying, "Oh, my."
What does it say?

1065
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:59,494
He left the money to Karen.

1066
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:01,297
He changed the beneficiary.

1067
00:47:01,331 --> 00:47:03,966
No! Shit! Shit!

1068
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,135
Shit, shit, shit!

1069
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:08,837
Shit. Karen can't handle
that kind of money, Sheils.

1070
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:13,141
She's too young, too headstrong,
too... too promiscuous!

1071
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:14,975
- What's up?
- It's a good thing, Frank.

1072
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:17,178
Remember what you were saying
about the orphanage?

1073
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,079
Eddie was trying to protect me.

1074
00:47:19,113 --> 00:47:20,814
Oh, protect you, my ass!

1075
00:47:20,848 --> 00:47:22,416
Oh!
He did this to fuck me!

1076
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,351
- $75,000?
- We can fight this, Sheils.

1077
00:47:24,386 --> 00:47:26,920
- We'll get lawyers.
- No, Frank.

1078
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:28,522
This is good.

1079
00:47:28,556 --> 00:47:31,825
Eddie had a hard time
showing his affection to Karen.

1080
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,062
This is his way.
This is good.

1081
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:35,930
I'm happy.

1082
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:43,838
Well, congratulations, my boy.

1083
00:47:43,873 --> 00:47:46,107
You hit the jackpot.
You have fallen into

1084
00:47:46,141 --> 00:47:48,175
a fucking field of
four leaf clovers,

1085
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,244
first time up at bat.

1086
00:47:50,278 --> 00:47:52,046
Frank...
I have put in the sweat.

1087
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,449
I've put in the time, I've put
in months of work, I have

1088
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:58,552
literally taken it up the ass,
and you fucking waltz in here.

1089
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,254
Frank.
What?

1090
00:48:00,288 --> 00:48:02,489
I think you should go.

1091
00:48:03,791 --> 00:48:06,960
No. Sheils.
I-I was just...

1092
00:48:06,995 --> 00:48:11,297
I didn't mean...

1093
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:17,303
Now?

1094
00:48:19,172 --> 00:48:22,813
I just can't believe she hasn't
called us or even left us a note.

1095
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:25,211
She's got to know we're sitting
over here sick with worry.

1096
00:48:25,246 --> 00:48:26,880
Yeah, yeah, no, here.
I'm still here.

1097
00:48:26,914 --> 00:48:28,816
Teenagers-- their hormone-soaked
brains aren't wired

1098
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:30,785
to think about anyone
other than themselves.

1099
00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:33,154
Right, okay.
Thank you very much.

1100
00:48:33,189 --> 00:48:35,457
Okay, social worker's gonna file
a missing persons report

1101
00:48:35,491 --> 00:48:37,993
and call the sheriff to go out
to that cult ranch

1102
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:40,095
to see if they're
over there.

1103
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,330
She thinks we should drive
around the neighborhood.

1104
00:48:41,331 --> 00:48:42,965
- Kev?
- Ethel may not have gotten far.

1105
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:44,500
Happens to a lot
of kids, she says.

1106
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:47,401
But I just cannot believe
how selfish Ethel is being.

1107
00:48:47,436 --> 00:48:49,336
You think something horrible
might have happened to her?

1108
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:51,939
A child kidnapper
or something?

1109
00:48:51,973 --> 00:48:53,840
"I hope you understand
why I had to leave.

1110
00:48:53,874 --> 00:48:56,009
"I know that God will
watch over you both.

1111
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:58,310
I know we will see each
other again some day. Ethel."

1112
00:48:58,345 --> 00:49:00,846
I'm getting the truck keys.

1113
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,448
We'll start over by the park
and then work our way

1114
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,417
around back to the school.

1115
00:49:04,451 --> 00:49:06,018
What the
hell is that?

1116
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,454
Oh, boy.

1117
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:10,256
What?

1118
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:13,092
Uh... Remember that pot
you wanted me to get rid of?

1119
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:14,527
Yeah?

1120
00:49:14,561 --> 00:49:16,529
What if maybe
I didn't get rid of

1121
00:49:16,564 --> 00:49:18,765
as much of it
as I said I did?

1122
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,434
You buried it?

1123
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:21,835
Well, I mean...

1124
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,204
How much didn't
you get rid of?

1125
00:49:25,806 --> 00:49:28,541
(mutters)
Well...

1126
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:31,377
But how would
she sell it?

1127
00:49:31,411 --> 00:49:33,546
Nobody's gonna buy pot
off of a white girl

1128
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,214
in a <i>Little House on</i>
<i>the Prairie</i> dress.

1129
00:50:14,255 --> 00:50:16,522
Looking for this?

1130
00:50:18,793 --> 00:50:22,429
I don't think Ginger will mind
that I opened her check, do you?

1131
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:24,431
Seeing as how she's
dead and buried

1132
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:27,001
out in the yard,
according to Carl.

1133
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:29,337
You look like shit.

1134
00:50:29,371 --> 00:50:33,507
Get some coffee, 'cause
we have business to discuss.

1135
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,510
Scamming Ginger's
Social Security checks.

1136
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:38,779
(chuckles)

1137
00:50:38,813 --> 00:50:40,414
Clever boy.

1138
00:50:40,448 --> 00:50:41,848
But it's over.

1139
00:50:41,883 --> 00:50:44,016
Meet the new Ginger.

1140
00:50:44,051 --> 00:50:47,019
I'm gonna be here a while,
so get used to it.

1141
00:50:47,053 --> 00:50:49,427
I say, "Jump," you
say, "How high?"

1142
00:50:49,428 --> 00:50:50,021
Eat me!

1143
00:50:50,056 --> 00:50:54,959
I say, "Eat me!" I'm done
taking your shit! You got it?

1144
00:50:54,993 --> 00:50:56,293
I am a grown man.

1145
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:58,696
This is my family, not yours!

1146
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,132
You're a piss-poor
excuse for a mother!

1147
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,902
I was hoping
you would die in prison!

1148
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,272
You've made my life
a living hell, and I...

1149
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:11,610
I want you out of here! Now!

1150
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:15,480
Good for you.

1151
00:51:15,515 --> 00:51:19,218
It's great to get
that stuff out.

1152
00:51:19,253 --> 00:51:20,486
Feel better?

1153
00:51:20,521 --> 00:51:22,555
Now, this is what
I was thinking.

1154
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:24,957
I'm moving into your room,
I like the light.

1155
00:51:24,992 --> 00:51:27,326
And I'm gonna need
a flat screen up there.

1156
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,395
Don't worry.

1157
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:31,663
I'll give you
the money.

1158
00:51:31,698 --> 00:51:33,932
Can I be honest with you?

1159
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:37,602
I am not the reason
that your life is

1160
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,437
a piece of crap.

1161
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:41,172
You came out of me a loser.

1162
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:44,675
Now run to the store.
I'll make a list, okay?

1163
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,078
Give me my purse.

1164
00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:03,963
(phone ringing)

1165
00:52:03,998 --> 00:52:06,366
(turns phone off)

1166
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,214
It's tough, huh?

1167
00:52:22,249 --> 00:52:24,116
(children chatting
and shouting)

1168
00:52:24,151 --> 00:52:26,552
My parents
suck, too.

CARL:
Dad?

1171
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:58,486
- FRANK: Hmm?
- Wake up.

1172
00:52:58,521 --> 00:53:01,056
- What?
- You wet the bed.

1173
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,392
(groans)

1174
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:06,462
Find a dry spot.
