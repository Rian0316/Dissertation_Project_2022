1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,700
孩子们, 在交往过程中要不断地...
Kids, one of the things you learn about relationships is that you're never done

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,900
去了解对方
getting to know someone.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,640
每个人都有秘密
Everyone has secrets.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,930
有些是好的
Some are nice.

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,090
你知道怎么烤薄饼么?
You know how to make crepes?

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,580
真有你的
That is so cool.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,180
有些是不好的
Some aren't as nice.

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,570
然后就是和德雷克交往 算上你
And then there was Derek, and counting you,

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,450
- 一共是... - 我知道有多少人了
- that puts the total up to-- - Oh, I got your total.

10
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,340
我一直在算
I've been counting along.

11
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,140
还有一些就是惊悚的了
And some are just weird.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,640
你害怕七个小矮人?
You're scared of the seven dwarfs?

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,290
就怕多克!事情很蹊跷 (小矮人的头领)
Just Doc. He's creepy.

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,160
你看他就读的是医学院
I mean the guy went to medical school.

15
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,580
但为什么和6个煤炭工人住一起?
What's he doing living with six coal miners?

16
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,260
同志们 我兴奋地一晚上都没睡觉
Oh, man! I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night.

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,180
- 我打赌你们也没睡着 - 为什么?
- I bet you guys couldn't either. - Why?

18
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,140
当然是因为夏普形象店 第500家分店的
Only the Gala event for the Grand Opening

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,000
盛大开业典礼了 你们都没收到我的邮件?
of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,510
在你第四次发 猴子闻自己屁股的视频时
No, I blocked your address after the fourth time

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
我就把你拖进黑名单了
you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,480
我请客 我给你们准备了3张足疗卡
Come on! It's on me. I'm buying three of you foot massagers

23
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,080
和一套鼻毛修建工具 别乐得忘了自己姓啥哦
and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.

24
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,540
来 开路
Come on, let's go.

25
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,520
好的 走吧
Okay, I'm in.

26
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:02,830
- 杀向威乐布鲁克商场! - 杀向威乐布鲁克商场
- To the Willowbrook Mall! - To the Willowbrook Mall.

27
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,780
在商场?  那我不去了
Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,030
什么?  为什么啊?
What? Why not?

29
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,140
我就是不喜欢去商场
I just don't feel like going to a mall.

30
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,070
我们可以分肉桂面包的
We can split a Cinnabon.

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,880
不  我真的不去了
No, I'm really not going to go.

32
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,780
- 来吧 那很有意思的 - 我说了不去!
- Come on, it'll be fun. - No, I don't go to malls!

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,110
抱歉 我真的很不喜欢商场
Sorry, I just don't like malls.

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,750
为什么不喜欢?
Why not?

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,180
我不太想说
I'd rather not say.

36
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,330
- 夏普形象店 - 那里有时装展的
- Sharper Images. - But that's where clothes live.

37
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,430
算了 伙计们 罗宾不喜欢商场
Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls.

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,830
如果她不想说原因 那就不要勉强了
If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,180
我想我们应该尊重她的隐私
I think we should all just respect her privacy.

40
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,610
谢谢你 泰德
Thanks, Ted.

41
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,860
你到底为什么不愿去商场啊?
So, what's the deal with you and malls?

42
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,670
你不是说过么 如果我不想说
I thought you said that, if I didn't want to talk about it,

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,820
我就不用说了
I didn't have to.

44
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,560
那是当着别人的面
Yeah, with those people.

45
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,450
但我是你男朋友啊 到底怎么回事?
But I'm your boyfriend. Come on. What is it?

46
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,560
难道你在商场里被逮捕过?
Did you get arrested at a mall?

47
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,210
没
No.

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,030
- 在商场里被甩过? - 泰德
- Dumped at a mall? - Ted.

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
在商场里被认出来是加拿大人了?
Found out you were Canadian at a mall?

50
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,120
够了吧
Let it go.

51
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,830
困在商场的假山下面?
Trapped under a fake boulder at a mall?

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,110
- 别说笑了 - 在商场里被骚扰过?
- Let it go. - Mauled at the mall?

53
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,510
够了!
Let it go!

54
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,630
谁能困在商场的假山下?
And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall?

55
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,230
我9岁时掉进过 在俄亥俄州 不骗你
Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,200
我不能理解 为什么罗宾 不愿告诉我  她讨厌商场的原因?
I don't get it. Why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?

61
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,510
泰德  你应该感到庆幸罗宾有秘密
Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret.

62
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,880
你对一个人了解的越多
The more you learn about a person,

63
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,140
你就越逼近"终结时刻"
the better chance you have of hitting the fatal "Oh" moment.

64
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,270
"终结时刻"?
The "Oh" moment?

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
就是当你知道了 对方的某个事情后
Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person

66
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,150
你们的关系就终结了
that is going to be a deal breaker.

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,800
这是一个承诺戒指
It's a promise ring.

68
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,330
我向上帝承诺结婚前 我会一直保持处女之身
I made a pact with God to stay a virgin till I'm married.

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,560
我才不会乱节食
I don't have an eating disorder.

70
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,720
我都把食物放进嘴里 咀嚼后再吐出来
It's just when I put food in my mouth, I chew it, and then I spit it out.

71
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,230
我马上30岁了
I just turned 30.

72
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,120
所以相信我 关于对方的事
So trust me, you want to postpone

73
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,000
你知道的越晚越好
knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.

74
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,010
这我不同意 就算有所谓的"终结时刻"
Mmm. I disagree. If there is some potential "Oh" moment,

75
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,830
我也想尽快知道 这样... 还能有回旋的余地
I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?

76
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,320
我现在宣布你们结为夫妻
I now pronounce you, man and wife.

77
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,030
我爱你
I love you.

78
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,200
我是个变性人
I used to be a dude.

79
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,540
我同意泰德的观点
Yeah,  I agree with Ted.

80
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,500
在真正的交往中  应该无所保留
In a real relationship, you share everything.

81
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,000
所以我和马修之间 从来不保留秘密
That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.

82
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,400
你真是个天真的小孩 这有枚硬币...
You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter.

83
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,280
去自动点唱机唱首歌玩
Go play a song on the jukebox.

84
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,560
他们说的是真的 他们把所有事都告诉对方了
No, it's true. They tell each other everything.

85
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,500
我能抖出一箩筐事 那是马修绝对不可能告诉你的
I can think of tons of things, there's no way Marshall's told you.

86
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,720
那你来试试
Try me.

87
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,050
你知道马修在 切尔敦有过什么事么?
Do you know about the time Marshall was in Trenton?

88
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,730
有头驴扒掉了他的裤子
Donkey ate his pants. Yup.

89
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,340
在孟菲斯比尔的单身汉聚会上呢?
Bill's bachelor party in Memphis?

90
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,300
就是那次大家不得不用 泵把他胃里的镍币吸出来的时候?
Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?

91
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,390
你真可以...在西雅图?
Wow. Okay. Seattle.

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,230
少蒙人了! 马修从没去过西海岸
Trick question. Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest

93
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,360
因为他害怕雪怪
because he's afraid of Sasquatch.

94
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,630
该死 你都对了
Damn, you're good.

95
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,180
我不是害怕雪怪 而是我觉得应该随时保持警惕
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch, I just think we should all be on alert.

96
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,920
相信我 他们不仅知道对方的事
Trust me. Not only do they tell each other everything,

97
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,090
他们什么八卦都不放过
they want to know everything.

98
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,310
淋浴后我开始刷牙 但突然想起...
So after the shower I was brushing my teeth. And I was like,

99
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,220
天哪   我本打算来点橘子汁的
"Oh, man! I wanted to have some orange juice.

100
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,560
应该先喝了再刷牙
I should have done that first."

101
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,230
但我已经把牙膏挤在牙刷上了
But I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush.

102
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,740
所以我就不管了 先刷了再说...
So I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.

103
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,900
接下来怎么样了?
What happened next?

104
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,710
但同时 罗宾却什么都不跟我说
Yeah, meanwhile, Robin tells me nothing.

105
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,460
那你想知道罗宾的秘密么?
Fine. Do you want to know what Robin's secret is?

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,550
你知道?
You know?

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,020
当然
Of course I know.

108
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,950
她不敢正眼 瞧咱们并且脸颊绯红
She couldn't look at us, her face got flushed--

109
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,600
她觉得难以启齿了
that's shame, my friend.

110
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,400
我们的罗宾曾经是色情...
Our friend Robin used to do porn, wait for it...

111
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,460
行业工作者
...ography.

112
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,130
你用不着这么玩大喘气的
Yeah, we didn't really need to wait for that.

113
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,860
而且这太荒唐了
And it's ridiculous.

114
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,380
这不好说 他说的也有可能
I don't know. He could be right.

115
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,080
她发出过假的叫床声
She does have the fake orgasm noises down.

116
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,870
说什么呢
Hey!

117
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,480
怎么了? 墙的隔音效果又不好
What? The walls are thin.

118
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,170
我说的不是这个!
That's not what I'm "hey"ing you about.

119
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,180
你有没有考虑过这种可能
You know what it might be?

120
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,130
听上去有些夸张 但是也许罗宾已经结婚了
This is going to sound a little crazy but what if Robin is married?

121
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,780
结婚? 那和商场有什么关系?
Married? What does that have to do with the mall?

122
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,470
也许她是在商场结的婚
Well, maybe she got married at the mall.

123
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,170
在我老家明尼苏达州 很多人都想把婚礼办在
Back home in Minnesota, a ton of people get married

124
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,240
商场 那里很棒的
at the Mall of America. It's great.

125
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,960
有华丽的用来拍电影的 室内高尔夫球场
There's this gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures,

126
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,470
眼花缭乱的美食 是结婚地点的最佳...
numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable--

127
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,530
- 我们不要在商场结婚! - 我只是假设一下
- We are not getting married at the mall! - Well, just meet with the guy.

128
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,200
她没结婚  她厌恶结婚的
She's not married. Robin hates marriage.

129
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,630
那是因为她已经在商场
Because she already got married.

130
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,360
结婚了
At the mall.

131
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,530
罗宾在来到纽约前...
No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
到底是干什么的啊?
What was she doing?

133
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,680
我不知道 我每次提到在加拿大的事
Well, I don't know. Whenever I ask her about Canada,

134
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,880
她就沉默了
she kind of clams up.

135
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,740
她真是一个注重隐私的人
She's a pretty private person.

136
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,620
除了在谈到...
Except when she's talking about...

137
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,180
我有一个朋友结婚很早
Oh, a friend of mine in Canada got married way too young

138
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,710
结果使她很厌恶结婚
and it really turned her off to marriage.

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,410
你认为这个结婚蛋糕怎么样?
What  do you think of this wedding cake?

140
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,920
不错 我喜欢
Oh, I like it.

141
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,440
你记得我提过的 一个在加拿大的朋友
Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada

142
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
就是结婚太早的那个?
who got married way too young?

143
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,420
她的结婚时就是 菲尔茨太太做的巨型蛋糕
Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Fields' giant cookie.

144
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,000
我可不要...
No.

145
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,910
我那个在加拿大结婚太早的朋友
My friend in Canada who got married way too young,

146
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,290
她的婚誓发了两次 一次是用法语发的
they had to do their vows twice, once in French.

147
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,880
加拿大人也讲法语么?
They speak French there, too?

148
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,880
{\an8}加拿大以前是法国的殖民地,当地人有很多都是用法语作为母语的

149
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,870
什么乱七八糟的事
God, that place is a mess.

150
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,870
所以你认为她在加拿大 并没有这个所谓的朋友?
So you don't think there's any "friend" from Canada?

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,180
肯定是的
Oh, I'm sure there is.

152
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,890
我有个朋友到10岁了  还尿床呢
Just like I have a "friend" who wet his bed till he was ten.

153
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,600
动动你的脑子吧  泰德
Use your brain, Ted.

154
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,410
伙计们 罗宾不可能结婚了
Guys, there's no way Robin is married.

155
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,160
这种猜测忒荒唐了点
It's ludicrous to even suggest it.

156
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,420
- 就是的 巴尼 - 她肯定是干色情行业的
- Thank you, Barney. - 'Cause it's porn.

157
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,090
我再去要杯啤酒
I need another beer.

158
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,390
罗宾肯定不是干那个的 我跟你打赌 罗宾肯定是结婚了
Robin was not in porn. I bet you anything that she's married.

159
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,990
打赌两万美金
$20,000 says it's porn.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,330
我没两万美金
I don't have $20,000.

161
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,230
那你有点什么?
Well, then what do you have?

162
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,800
- 能借... - 别想
- Well... - No.

163
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,250
我知道了  换个形式
I've got it. The ultimate wager--

164
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,540
打赌输了 打耳光
slap bet.

165
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,780
打耳光? 我们小时候这么干过
Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.

166
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,100
打赌打耳光是什么意思?
What the hell's a slap bet?

167
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,090
打赌赢了的人可以打 输了的人力度不限
Whoever is right gets to slap the other person in the face

168
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,380
而且输了的人不许还击
as hard as they possibly can-- but no rings.

169
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,070
你真的要这么干? 这太幼稚了吧
Are you really going to do that? That's so immature.

170
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,790
- 你当这次赌的监察官 - 我干...我的权力是什么?
- You can be Slap Bet Commissioner. - Ooh, I love it. What are my powers?

171
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,860
如果出现争议由你来仲裁
Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job.

172
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,650
但是你不得有私心
But you have to be unbiased

173
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,910
要保证这个赌公平公正公开
and put the integrity of slap bet above all else.

174
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,650
这可是件让你祖坟上冒青烟的事
This is an honor you will take with you to your grave.

175
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,390
等你百年之后 墓碑上会这么刻着
On your tombstone, it will read,

176
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,730
莉莉・艾得仁  不仅是 一位体贴的妻子 可爱的朋友
"Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend,

177
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,720
还是打耳光游戏的监察官
Slap Bet Commissioner."

178
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,570
那么你的墓碑上会刻着 "牺牲于马修的猛掌袭击下"
And your tombstone will read "Got slapped by Marshall, so hard he died."

179
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,090
继续来 我要怎样在罗宾面前 切入到"丈夫"这个话题上
Okay. What if I just ask Robin point blank if she has a husband?

180
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,200
你不是说尊重罗宾的隐私嘛
You said you would respect her privacy,

181
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,390
你还是不要计较这件事了
so maybe you should just drop it.

182
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,270
算了 就这么着吧
Yeah, you're right.

183
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,610
老工
Husband.

184
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,150
你的"老公"拼错了
There's no "P" in husband.

185
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,150
你对这个挺有研究的啊
Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.

186
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,690
好吧 我改
Fine. I'll take it back.

187
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,750
你既然提到了"老公" 给你讲个有意思的事
Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're going to love this.

188
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,380
知道马修吧 他认为你那天
Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason

189
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,920
不愿意去商场的原因
you didn't want to go to the mall the other day

190
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:50,050
你在加拿大时已经结婚 婚礼是在商场办的
is because you got married at a mall and have a husband in Canada.

191
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,820
我说他有病 你说他是不是?
I told him he's crazy. Because he's crazy, right?

192
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,260
真不知他哪根筋搭错了
I mean, how crazy is that?

193
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,590
你是想问我结婚没有吧
Are you asking me if I'm married?

194
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,870
你可以问我的
Well, you can ask me.

195
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,010
我当然没结 该你了
Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.

196
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,130
不是说尊重我的隐私么?
What happened to respecting my privacy?

197
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,800
说"不 我没结婚"就好了呗
Look, just say, "No, I'm not married."

198
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,630
泰德 我不明白你为什么...
Ted,  I don't understand why you can't--

199
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,190
就说一句"不 我没结婚"
Just say, "No, I'm not married."

200
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,840
不行
I can't.

201
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,860
马修说的没错
Marshall's right.

202
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,660
我年纪很轻时就结婚了
I was young and I got married.

203
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,640
但这是个错误  他早就离开了...
It was a mistake and he moved away, but...

204
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,480
是的  我结过婚
yeah. I'm married.

205
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,070
你有老公了?
You have a husband?

206
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,010
我当时太年轻 太傻了
I was young and stupid

207
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,290
我们在商场里结婚 并在商场里分手了
and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall

208
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,050
从那以后我再也不去商场了
and I... I haven't been to a mall since.

209
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,420
那你怎么没离婚?
Why didn't you get divorced?

210
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,890
他搬到香港工作了 然后我就...
He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like...

211
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,310
就这么多了
eh, good enough.

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,530
就这样了? 这怎么行
Good  enough? That's not good enough.

213
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,640
你还得烤薄饼 弄点瓦夫饼干 这样才行
You order pancakes, you get waffles, that's good enough.

214
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,840
我已经很多年没见过他了
Look, I haven't seen him in years.

215
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,700
这只是我生活里 需要遗忘的一部分
It's just a part of my life I want to forget.

216
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,000
别告诉其他人这件事
Just please don't tell anyone about this.

217
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,710
知道了
Okay.

218
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,260
好家伙 你的手是熊掌啊
Dude, your hand is monstrous.

219
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,980
你以为我是什么? 你不是见识过我的能力了么
Yeah, well, what'd you expect? You've seen my penis.

220
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:18,250
没想到你会 告诉我们罗宾的秘密
I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.

221
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,830
怎么了?这事你叫我怎么保持沉默?
What? How could I keep something like that to myself?

222
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,190
你不是央求我说的么?
And you begged me to tell you.

223
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,650
有么?
No, I didn't.

224
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,700
告诉我们吧 就说一下嘛 求你了
Please tell us. Just tell us. I'm begging you.

225
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,910
说一下 说一下 就说一下 拜托了...
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. Please please please--

226
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,410
够了 罗宾她结婚了
Fine. Robin's married.

227
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,500
其实你不该告诉我们的
Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us.

228
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,420
你怎么能这么当男友啊?
I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?

229
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,440
可事实上我根本不是她男朋友
See that's just it, I'm not the boyfriend.

230
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,860
我只是个情妇
I'm the mistress.

231
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,310
不  还不如这
No, not the mistress.

232
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,810
是情夫
The mastress.

233
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,360
情父  这字怎么写来着?
The master. What do you call it?

234
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,470
我肯定是写成情妇
Uh, pretty sure we're going to call it mistress.

235
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,670
我该怎么办? 我的女友是已婚的
What am I going to do? My girlfriend's married.

236
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,220
我该要求她离婚么?
Do I ask her to get a divorce?

237
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,400
泰德 就算她结婚了 那也是个加拿大式婚姻
Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage.

238
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,470
好比金钱啊  军队啊 这些身外之物
It's like their money, or their army.

239
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,530
没人在意的
Nobody takes it seriously.

240
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,730
可我在意
It's serious to me.

241
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,640
在一些国家当夫妻分居达5年以上
You know what, in some countries, if you been separated

242
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,390
在法律上  这个婚姻就无效了
for longer than five years, technically, you're no longer married.

243
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,950
这是我在学校 查阅法律书籍知道的
I can check it out at the law library at school.

244
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,880
你的脸上还印着我的指印
I can see my hand print on your face.

245
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,610
别得意的太早
Don't get too cocky, Slappy.

246
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,680
我还在搜集加拿大的色情业资料
I just got a shipment of porn from Canada I have to go through.

247
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,690
这赌我都赢了 你还折腾个什么劲啊?
I won the bet. Why are you still searching?

248
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,500
就算你是对的 也不意味着我是错的
Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.

249
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,860
算了吧 你只是 在给自己找个理由看色情片
Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch porn.

250
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,110
加拿大情色片
Canadian porn.

251
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,660
相信我　加拿大的医疗保险
Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system

252
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,110
是不给隆胸买单的
doesn't cover breast implants.

253
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,110
如果我在看到一个平胸的 新斯科瓦省的女人
If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,400
骑着马在铺冰机上面溜达的时候
riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni

255
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,880
我会崩溃的
I'll go out of my mind.

256
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,670
- 好啊 - 来了
- Hey. - Hey.

257
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,870
我有事跟你说
Listen, dude, I got to talk to you,

258
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,040
但是你要保证不告诉巴尼
but you got to promise me that you won't tell Barney.

259
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,560
好的 我不告诉他 怎么了?
Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?

260
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,320
- 罗宾没有结婚 - 什么?
- Robin's not married. - What?

261
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,820
那她为什么说她结婚了?
Why would she tell me she was?

262
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,980
我不知道 但是我 查遍了加拿大的相关资料
I don't know, but I cross- checked every record in Canada.

263
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,870
没有记录表明她结过婚
There's no record of her ever being married.

264
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,010
这肯定出了问题
There must be some mistake.

265
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,830
我跟你保证 她没有结婚
I promise you. She's not married.

266
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,190
她也不擅长正确泊位
She's not great at parking legally either.

267
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,060
那么是她对我说谎了? 那我该怎么办?
So she lied to me? W--What am I going to do?

268
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,100
我不能和她对证 不能让她知道我把这事说了出去
I-I can't confront her, 'cause then she'll know I told you.

269
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,390
你可以诱导她
You got to lawyer her.

270
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,950
你可以问她一堆问题 把她搞晕
You got to ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up,

271
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,540
使她产生罪恶感 不管使什么手段
maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes

272
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:24,380
都要让她自己招供
to get a confession out of her.

273
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,720
谢谢你告诉我你的秘密
Thanks for telling me your secret.

274
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,190
这对我来说 表明了你是多么的...
It means so much to me, that you could be so--

275
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,040
我该怎么措辞?
God, what's the word I'm looking for?

276
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
诚实
Honest.

277
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,000
谢谢 泰德
Mm, thanks, Ted.

278
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,150
你知道你最让我感动的是
Yeah. You know what's probably the best part about your honesty?

279
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,020
你竟然这么诚实
How truthful it is.

280
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,140
别这么肉麻了
I say we just move on.

281
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,290
就让我把 "我的女友结婚了"这件事
Well, for me to get total closure on this whole

282
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,600
做一个彻底了断
"my girlfriend has a husband" thing,

283
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,270
我想再稍微地了解清楚一点
I think I might need a little bit more information,

284
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,210
比如说你是几月结婚的?
like what month did you get married?

285
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,060
六月  婚礼是在六月办的
June. We had a June wedding.

286
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,420
六月的加拿大啊
Ah, Canada in June.

287
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,250
真是浪漫
That's the dream.

288
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,090
是宴会还是自助餐会 ??
Sit-down  or buffet?

289
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:02,870
你要是不记得就很奇怪了
Well, it's... weird that you don't remember.

290
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,050
我只是不知道该如何回答
No, I just didn't know how to answer

291
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,010
因为开胃菜 是在大厅里面吃的
because we did butlered hors d'oeuvres in the atrium,

292
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,050
但宴会实际上 是在餐厅里吃自助餐
but the actual dinner was a buffet in the Food Court

293
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,450
特色菜甜菲力牛排 三文鱼夹心的烤马铃薯卷
featuring a filet mignon or a roasted potato-crusted salmon

294
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,190
还有龙虾蘸白葡萄酒酱
with a lobster scallion beurre blanc.

295
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,670
乐队和司仪?
Band or DJ?

296
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,850
典礼上有管弦四重奏
A string quartet played at the ceremony,

297
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,860
但在宴会上 是个七人乐队伴唱
but for the actual reception, we had a seven-piece band.

298
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,620
我们还专门请了一个萨克斯手
We paid extra for the sax

299
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,170
因为中音萨克斯的 琴声实在很好听
'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.

300
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,860
- 请了几个伴娘? - 7个
- How many bridesmaids? - Seven.

301
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,180
- 花束是? - 杜鹃
- Flowers? - Azaleas.

302
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,480
- 色彩方案? - 偏暗的玫瑰色和黄褐色
- Color scheme? - Dusty rose and sienna.

303
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,280
老公的名字
Husband's name.

304
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,520
- 你没结过婚! - 不 我结了
- You were never married! - Yes, I was.

305
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,460
- 不 你没有 -你怎么知道的?
- No, you weren't. - How do you know?

306
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,860
我在图书馆里查了
I looked it up at the library.

307
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,450
- 那个数据图书馆? - 五楼的第一个
- What library? - The one on Fifth.

308
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,370
- 你什么时候去的? - 今天午饭时候
- When did you go? - Today at lunch,

309
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,420
我点了苹果乾酪和土豆沙拉
and I had an apple brie panini with potato salad...

310
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,660
我不是问你午餐吃的什么
I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted.

311
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,270
你从哪得到的数据?
What database did you use?

312
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:03,010
"加拿大商场结婚6000例"
I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.

313
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,890
马修在学校查阅了资料
Fine, Marshall looked it up at school.

314
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,040
- 你告诉马修了?! - 你对我撒了谎!
- You told Marshall?! - You lied to me!

315
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:09,950
这就是我为什么 不愿意告诉别人秘密的原因
See, this is why I don't tell people secrets.

316
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,510
我把你当成了最能够信任的人
You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most

317
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,190
你都不能守住秘密
and even you couldn't keep a secret.

318
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,520
但这是一个假秘密
But it was a fake secret.

319
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,800
我只是测试一下你 你是不及格的
Yeah, I was testing you and you failed.

320
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,190
现在你将永远 别想知道我为什么不去商场
And now you're never gonna know why I don't go to the mall.

321
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,210
这样是最好的
And it's good, too.

322
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,110
你在测试我?真难以置信
You  were testing me? That's insane.

323
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,890
是么 难以置信的是 你才知道了多久
Oh, yeah? How long did it take for you to tell Marshall

324
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,740
就把我的秘密告诉了马修? 有五分钟没?
my biggest secret in the world? Five minutes?

325
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,610
- 那根本就不是真的秘密! - 但它也有可能是
- That wasn't a real secret! - Yeah, but it could have been.

326
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,970
你让我要崩裂了!
You are driving me crazy!

327
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,890
难怪你的冒牌丈夫逃去了香港
No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.

328
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,160
他是因为工作才去的
He moved there for business.

329
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,900
你
You.

330
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,650
没什么事要告诉我么?
You got something to say to me?

331
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,470
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

332
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,510
我知道罗宾根本就没结婚
I know Robin was never really married.

333
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,440
你是怎么知道的?
How could you possibly know that?

334
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,700
然后我就穿上睡裤钻进被窝了
And then I put on my pajamas and got into bed.

335
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,310
你呢?
How about you?

336
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,660
让我想想 我先是乘地铁到学校
Oh, let's see, uh, first I took the subway to school.

337
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,960
吃了个面包
Then I got a bagel.

338
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,330
然后去了图书馆查资料 发现罗宾其实没结婚
Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married.

339
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,460
受了打击
Crazy.

340
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,570
结果我又饿了 就去了自动售货机那儿
Then I was hungry again, so I went down to the vending machine,

341
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,740
但到我走到那儿时 我又不饿了
but by the time I got down there, I wasn't even hungry anymore.

342
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,120
- 你告诉他了? - 没办法
- You told him? - I had to.

343
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,470
我是这次打赌的监察官
I'm Slap Bet Commissioner.

344
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,580
相信我 我是看在眼里疼在心上
Believe me, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.

345
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,510
废话少说 我在树上 已经练习过好多次了
Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.

346
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,030
- 巴尼要打你三个耳光 - 三个?
- Barney gets three slaps. - Three?

347
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,090
一个是因为你说谎了
还有两个是没得到 我允许就打巴尼的惩罚
One because you lied and two for being prematurely slapped.

348
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,230
一共三个
Three slaps.

349
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,330
但是...
But--

350
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,240
不是吧
Oh, my God.

351
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,780
- 你要哭了? - 哪有
- Are you gonna cry? - No.

352
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,790
你才哭了呢
You're gonna cry.

353
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,150
我认为保守秘密会影响感情发展的
I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship.

354
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,070
我父母三十年都不怎么沟通
My parents didn't really talk to each other for 30 years

355
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,180
搞得现在离婚了
and now they're divorced.

356
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,990
我是让你更了解我
I have shared more of myself with you

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,100
而不是所有人
than I've ever shared with anyone.

358
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,250
就让我留这一个秘密
I'm asking for this one secret,

359
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,030
它对我们的感情不会有影响的
which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.

360
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,700
我刚接到了一个有趣的电话
So I just got a very interesting phone call.

361
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,130
你在说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

362
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,920
罗宾的秘密我知道
I know Robin's secret.

363
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,550
- 什么? - 没错
- What? - That's right.

364
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
我知道了你的秘密 罗宾
I know your secret, Robin.

365
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:18,130
还是我应该叫你罗宾火花?
Or should I say Robin Sparkles?

366
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,050
你怎么知道这个名字的?
How do you know that name?

367
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,940
因为我知道真相
Because I know the truth,

368
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,530
并且我现在就向你们证明
and I am about to show it to you right now.

369
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,240
过来 泰德 你肯定想知道这个
Gather 'round, Ted, you're gonna want to see this.

370
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,700
我不 不要
Yeah, no, I don't.

371
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,630
什么?
What?

372
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,160
罗宾想保留这个秘密 所以...
Robin wants to keep this a secret, so...

373
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,940
就让它成为秘密吧
it's gonna stay a secret.

374
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,720
它不会一直是秘密的
Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret.

375
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:37,100
在我的调查中
You see, in my research,

376
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,490
我认识了某一马来西亚的男子
I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia

377
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,270
他有一盘录像带
who is in possession of a certain videotape.

378
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,560
准备在邮件中给我发送过来
He just emailed me that it will be up and running

379
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,080
现在刚好发完
on My Space in about... right now.

380
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,760
罗宾的世界会天翻地覆的
Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down.

381
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,280
我猜的
I mean, I'm guessing.

382
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,430
巴尼 别这样 好么?
Barney, don't, okay?

383
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,530
罗宾 别惊慌
Robin, please don't panic.

384
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,560
我只是想给马修证明我是对的
I'm only gonna show enough to prove to Marshall I was right.

385
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,820
不 巴尼 我说了我们不看
No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.

386
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,620
算了 总有这么一天的
No, it's time.

387
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,480
我很欣慰你愿意这么做
Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do,

388
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,900
但是纸终究包不住火
but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore.

389
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,690
还是面对现实 看看吧
Let's just watch it and be done with it.

390
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,020
你跟我一样觉得紧张么?
Are you as terrified as I am?

391
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,930
我可不想再被打耳光了
I don't want to get slapped again.

392
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,860
我想强调一下 那时我太年轻了
I want to stress that I was young.

393
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,070
可以理解
Yeah, you were.

394
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,440
我不知道怎么做才是好的
And I didn't know any better.

395
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,000
怎么都不会好
They never do.

396
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,660
那刚开始只是单纯的模特工作
And it started out as an innocent modeling job.

397
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,690
都是这么入门的
It always does.

398
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,460
拜托了 约翰逊先生
Please, Mr. Johnson.

399
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,840
我知道是我不好
I'm sorry I was a bad girl.

400
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,510
不要关我禁闭好么
Please don't give me detention.

401
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,450
要不要我做点什么弥补一下?
Isn't there something I can do to make it up to you?

402
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,940
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

403
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,950
显而易见  我才是正确的
Well, obviously, I've been proven right,

404
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,010
为了维护罗宾的尊严
so in the interest of Robin's dignity,

405
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,280
演示到此为止
I won't show anymore.

406
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,090
好了 时间不早了 该到行刑时间了
Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.

407
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,090
你们在搞什么?
What the hell was that?

408
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,830
我和马修打赌说 你是拍A片的  我赢了
Uh, I slap bet Marshall that you did porn, so I win.

409
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,790
A片? 是就好了 也没这个丢人
Porn? I wish it was porn. It would be less embarrassing.

410
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,360
我知道了
I know.

411
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,010
我为你唱首歌怎样?
How about I sing you a song?

412
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,190
大家一起去商场!
Let's go to the mall, everybody!

413
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:31,460
我在加拿大是个青春偶像
I was a teenage pop star in Canada.

414
00:17:32,065 --> 00:17:34,073
# Put on your jelly bracelets #

415
00:17:34,088 --> 00:17:36,123
# And your cool graffiti coat #

416
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:37,762
# At the mall, having fun #

417
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:40,822
# Is what it's all about #

418
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,160
这是我见过最惊悚的事了
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

419
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,070
- 那是你? - 是
- That's you? - Yes.

420
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,920
我出了张唱片
I had one minor hit.

421
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,940
所以不得不在 全加拿大的商场里作宣传
I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls.

422
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,110
整整一年我忙的 只能喝橘子汁吃椒盐卷饼
For a whole year, I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.

423
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:59,760
# Everybody come and play #

424
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:03,960
# Throw every last care away #

425
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,240
# Let's go to the mall #

426
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:09,243
# Today #

427
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,350
这是90年代 怎么看起来象80年代
If this is the '90s, why does it look like 1986?

428
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,100
美国93年的时候 加拿大还处在80年代
The '80s didn't come to Canada till, like, '93.

429
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,950
在观看的过程中我要打断一下
Taking a break from the first of many, many viewings,

430
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,520
我肯定这不是A片
I can't help but notice that this isn't porn.

431
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,330
所以  不用请示监察官了
And yet, a slap occurred without the permission

432
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,370
直接执行吧
of the Slap Bet Commissioner.

433
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,060
现在我要 "以其人之道还治其人之身"
Looks like somebody suffered from premature slapulation.

434
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,580
我的天 罗宾还能念rap
Oh, my God, Robin's rapping.

435
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,900
看 她在念rap
Guys, Robin's rapping.

436
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,760
# Went to the mall with # # a couple of friends #

437
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:40,103
# I had a whole week's # # allowance to spend #

438
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,380
这样  给你两个选择
Okay, I'm going to give you a choice.

439
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,020
要么现在一次打十个耳光
Either ten slaps right now in a row,

440
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,560
要么就是5个耳光 但是场合不限
or five slaps that can be doled out

441
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,120
时间没有截止点
at any point from here to eternity.

442
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,550
你选一次打十个吧
You go with the ten now.

443
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,530
别 不是可以选只挨5个的么?
No way, why get ten when you can get five?

444
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,560
但是你会一直处于 耳光不知何时降临的
Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment,

445
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,320
提心吊胆中 会让你精神崩溃的
you could get slapped in the face, would drive you crazy.

446
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,970
我选打5个
I'm going to go with the five for eternity.

447
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,590
- 选的好 - 选错了
- Good call. - Horrible call.

448
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,520
别紧张 哥们 我只是拿我的汽水而已
Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man.

449
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,410
放松点
Take it easy.

450
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,350
别那么搞笑啊
This is going to be fun.

451
00:19:11,028 --> 00:19:12,401
# Let's go to the mall #

452
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:15,103
# Let's go to the mall #

453
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:16,803
# Today #

454
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,990
请问一下
So just to be clear,

455
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,090
你那么想让大家 在今天 去商场?
you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?

456
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,080
我们会反复欣赏这个"经典"的
Wow, we're going to watch this a lot.

457
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,410
简直难以相信 我竟然穿着贝德丝牛仔夹克
I can't believe I ever wore a Bedazzled jean jacket.

458
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:32,030
那你知道么
Hey, just so you know,

459
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,730
十六岁的我 如果遇见你就会一见钟情
16-year-old me would have been all over you.

460
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,900
而你就是我曾跟别人提起过 在加拿大时的女朋友
You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had.

461
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,730
很抱歉我窥探了这个秘密
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you.

462
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,650
我应该让它一直埋藏下去的
I probably should have left it alone.

463
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,610
那有什么?
You know what?

464
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,430
你对我更加了解了
You know me better now.

465
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,090
这样不是更好么
That feels kind of nice.

466
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,230
这是第一个
That's one.

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,912
# Everybody come and play #

468
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:09,485
# Throw every last care away #

469
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,364
Wow.

470
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,302
# Let's go to the mall #

471
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,075
# Today #

472
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,712
你是不是每次都得这么笑着唱?
Did you have to laugh like that every time?

473
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,102
是啊
Yes.

474
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,414
# This boy I like #

475
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,242
# Met him at the food court #

476
00:20:22,258 --> 00:20:23,744
# He's got hair like Gretzky #

477
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:26,295
# And he does jumps # # on his skateboard #

478
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,403
# I hope he asks me out #

479
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,284
# Take me to my favorite spot #

480
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:31,922
# It'll be just him and me #

481
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,045
# But don't forget the robot #

482
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:37,452
机器人 嗨!
The robot. Hey!

483
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:41,505
# But, baby # # I don't want to wait #

484
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,243
# Let's do it #

485
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,832
不  是她迫不及待了
No, she doesn't want to wait.

486
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,784
# I'm gonna rock # # your body anyway #

487
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,435
