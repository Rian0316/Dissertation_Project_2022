1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,331
- Problem?
- This is the worst cobbler I've eaten.

2
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:15,599
It tastes like it's made of actual
ground-up shoe maker.

3
00:00:15,774 --> 00:00:19,266
Amusing.
A play on the two meanings of cobbler.

4
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:25,642
Hey, guys.
My baby sister Priya.

5
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,808
Excuse me, I object.

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:32,013
You propose a guessing game,
yet you don't give me time to guess.

7
00:00:33,025 --> 00:00:35,858
For the record,
I was going to say, "Your sister Priya."

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,490
Oh, Sheldon, you haven't
changed a bit, have you?

9
00:00:40,032 --> 00:00:41,624
Why would I change?

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,928
The hope has been that you'd
eventually bend to public opinion.

11
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,001
So, what brings you back to L. A?

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,232
I have a layover on my way to Toronto.

13
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,239
- Corporate merger.
- Can you believe it?

14
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:55,413
Priya is a lead attorney
for the biggest car company in India.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,549
Given that when we met her,
she was finishing law school...

16
00:00:58,717 --> 00:01:01,709
...and planning an internship
at a large Indian car company...

17
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,752
...it's actually extremely plausible.

18
00:01:04,323 --> 00:01:07,087
And your poll numbers
just keep dropping.

19
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:11,186
I want to catch up with all of you,
but first I really must visit the loo.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,092
Ah, I'm going too.
I'll show you where it is.

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,398
This goes without saying,
but I'm gonna anyway.

22
00:01:17,736 --> 00:01:19,670
Hands off my sister.

23
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:23,501
Why would I touch her?
She's covered with airplane germs.

24
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:27,178
I am so not talking to you,
I'm talking to him.

25
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:29,838
Hey, heh, I've got a girlfriend now.

26
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:33,849
Oh, please. My sister is much hotter
than your girlfriend, and you know it.

27
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,577
Let's agree they're both hot.

28
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:38,279
What...? Dude, that's my sister
you're talking about.

29
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,185
Okay, forget who's hotter.
The first time Priya came to L. A...

30
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:46,354
...Leonard and I made a pact out of
respect to our friendship and to you...

31
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:48,590
...that neither of us would hit on her.

32
00:01:48,767 --> 00:01:50,098
Did you pinkie swear?

33
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,565
Yes.

34
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:57,398
Okay, then.

35
00:01:57,809 --> 00:01:59,299
Cobbler. I'm still laughing.

36
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,872
It's really nice to see you again,
Leonard.

37
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,074
Yeah, it's good to see you too.

38
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,048
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

39
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,027
Okay.

41
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:45,181
You got any special plans
with your sister?

42
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:47,655
Oh, not really. Just hang out.

43
00:02:47,826 --> 00:02:51,353
I always tell people if you have
only one day in Los Angeles...

44
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,828
...make it a train day.

45
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,663
"Train day"?

46
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,735
The fun starts with brunch
at Carney's in Studio City...

47
00:02:58,904 --> 00:03:02,067
...a hot dog stand
in a converted railroad dining car.

48
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:04,174
Next stop, Travel Town...

49
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:07,903
...an outdoor museum
featuring 43 railroad engines, cars...

50
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,139
...and other rolling stock
from the 1880s to the 1930s.

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,843
Then finally, we're off to the glitz
and glamour of Hollywood...

52
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,012
...for dinner at, that's right,
the Hollywood Carney's...

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,890
...a hot dog stand in a different
converted railroad dining car.

54
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,091
I don't think we're gonna do that.

55
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,325
Well, then apparently you hate fun.

56
00:03:34,473 --> 00:03:37,931
Hmm? Priya's not back yet?
Well, I guess that's not unusual.

57
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,236
Women, men,
the whole sitting-standing deal.

58
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,346
So, what are we talking about?

59
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,879
Uh, my plans with Priya.

60
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:45,914
He rejected train day.

61
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:50,282
Did you make it clear it's two different
train cars turned into hot dog stands?

62
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:52,047
Abundantly.

63
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:53,919
I guess he just hates fun.

64
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:57,225
That's what I said.

65
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,197
Okay, so, what's new with you guys?

66
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,029
- I have a girlfriend now.
- Hey. Good for you.

67
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,727
I just wanna put it out there...

68
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:10,272
...in case I inadvertently squirt
any pheromones in your direction.

69
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:12,967
Happy?

70
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:16,941
So, uh, what are your plans
while you're here?

71
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:19,083
I don't know, I just have the one day.

72
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:21,718
Do you like trains?

73
00:04:22,454 --> 00:04:24,285
Not particularly.

74
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:30,758
You might as well just wait at the airport
for your flight.

75
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,391
"You are in a forest.

76
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:39,594
There is quicksand to the west,
a path leads to the east."

77
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:42,973
Go east.

78
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,474
"An iron gate blocks your way."

79
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,774
Open gate.

80
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:52,781
"It's locked." Hmm.

81
00:04:53,518 --> 00:04:55,611
Well, so much for that.

82
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:02,118
- It's pretty late. You're still up?
- I found an emulator online...

83
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:07,095
...that lets you play classic text-based
computer games from the 1980s.

84
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,698
- That's pretty cool.
- Oh, yes.

85
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,494
It runs on the world's
most powerful graphics chip:

86
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,695
Imagination.

87
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:17,402
You've really got to get out more.

88
00:05:18,543 --> 00:05:20,306
Go north.

89
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:22,343
"You can't go that way."

90
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:24,379
Go west.

91
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:26,608
"A troll blocks your passage."

92
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,980
Okay, fasten your seat belts.

93
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,689
Kill troll.

94
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:34,449
"With what?"

95
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:35,854
With sword.

96
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:39,196
"You don't have the sword."
Good golly...

97
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:41,965
...it's as if it's actually
happening to me.

98
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,330
- Raj finally went to bed.
- Yeah...

99
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,172
...Sheldon's still up.

100
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:53,004
You said he goes to bed at 9.

101
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,510
He got caught up
in a computer game and...

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,444
Hit troll with axe.

103
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,182
Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe.

104
00:06:03,955 --> 00:06:06,753
Oh, my, this is one tough troll.

105
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,553
Can't you get rid of him?

106
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,321
If the past is any indication, no.

107
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:16,263
Leonard, I'm trapped in
quicksand. The axe is dragging me down.

108
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:19,767
- Drop axe.
- Drop axe. Brilliant.

109
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,107
Give me a minute.

110
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:27,738
- Sheldon.
- Hold on.

111
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,073
I need to figure out
how to get the bucket...

112
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,341
...so I can carry the mud
past the dragon.

113
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:35,549
- You need to work in the morning.
- I know.

114
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,280
- Well, then bed, mister.
- Five more minutes.

115
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:40,854
Really? You'll risk getting sleepy...

116
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,893
...in the middle of your thermodynamic
fluctuations seminar?

117
00:06:44,095 --> 00:06:46,757
You know what happens
when you yawn in public.

118
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,493
Everyone will see
my oddly shaped uvula.

119
00:06:55,006 --> 00:06:57,236
And you don't want that, do you?

120
00:06:57,509 --> 00:06:58,942
No.

121
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:04,579
But it's a shame our society mocks
the differently uvulated.

122
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,241
Who was at the door?

123
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:09,252
Uh, building manager.

124
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:13,755
Uh, they have to fix a pipe, so the water
will be off tomorrow from noon to 2.

125
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:16,917
That's unacceptable. We're supposed
to be given written notice.

126
00:07:17,095 --> 00:07:19,120
No, it doesn't matter. We'll be at work.

127
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:22,460
What if I spill tomato soup
on my shirt and come home to change...

128
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:25,228
...only to find there's no water
for an enzyme soak?

129
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,303
Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon.

130
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,134
I'll have the chicken noodle.
Good night.

131
00:07:34,646 --> 00:07:37,240
We're gonna have to be very quiet.

132
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,083
I know how to get the bucket.

133
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,418
I can turn the axe around
and use the handle to reach it.

134
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,355
Let's see...

135
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:52,358
Go north.

136
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:53,792
"You are in a forest."

137
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:55,364
Go north.

138
00:07:55,567 --> 00:07:57,125
"You are in a forest."

139
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:59,270
Go north. "You are in a forest."

140
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,305
Oh, dear, I believe I'm lost.
I'll have to get a fresh start tomorrow.

141
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:06,967
No, no, no. You... You just need to
map it out. Come on, I'll help you.

142
00:08:07,145 --> 00:08:10,672
So, uh, you stopped at the stream
and you turned north three times?

143
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,443
- Yes.
- You're right, you're lost. Good luck.

144
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,349
Oh.

145
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:23,653
- Leonard, wake up.
- Huh? What...? Uh, sorry.

146
00:08:23,828 --> 00:08:25,193
- For what?
- I don't know.

147
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:28,355
When I'm in bed with a girl,
it's my go-to response.

148
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,661
I have to get back to Raj's before
he wakes up and realizes I'm gone.

149
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:35,328
Oh, right. Sure.

150
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,832
- Wish you could stay a while longer.
- Hmm, me too.

151
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:40,375
You know, I was thinking.

152
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:43,343
There are some great
research facilities in India.

153
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:46,006
Where are you going with this,
Leonard?

154
00:08:46,718 --> 00:08:50,176
Oh, I'm just saying, you know,
I don't have any real ties here...

155
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:55,349
...so if I were to move to New Delhi,
we could, you know, go out.

156
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:59,527
Leonard, didn't we have this
conversation five years ago?

157
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:03,360
Well, yes, but things have changed.
You're older, I'm older.

158
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,560
Look, no more superhero bed sheets.

159
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,233
Sweetheart, just because we have fun
when I come to town...

160
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:12,240
...doesn't mean I want to have
a serious relationship.

161
00:09:12,944 --> 00:09:14,275
- It doesn't?
- Mm-mm.

162
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:18,142
And besides, I could never bring
a white boy home to my parents.

163
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:22,913
They'd have a cow.
Which is a much bigger deal in India.

164
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,212
I'm not that white.

165
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,381
My great-great-grandmother
was half Cherokee.

166
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,789
That's not the right kind of Indian,
but it is something.

167
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:32,225
Ha, ha, you're funny. Ha-ha-ha.

168
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:36,032
Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

169
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:39,734
- What?
- I heard a woman laughing.

170
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:43,965
Oh, uh, yeah. I was trying to see
if I could laugh as a woman.

171
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,307
Oh. Well, good job. Quite convincing.

172
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:52,310
- I smell perfume.
- Air freshener.

173
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:55,281
And is that lipstick
on your cheek and neck?

174
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:57,216
Uh, rash. That's a bad rash.

175
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,412
My sympathies.

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,185
I'm no stranger to the crimson scourge
that is dermatitis.

177
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:08,391
Can I interest you in a topical steroid
from my lotion and unguent collection?

178
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,262
Uh, yeah, yeah. That sounds great.

179
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:15,770
Very well. I'm sure I can find something
that will help you ditch that itch.

180
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,733
Okay, he's in the bathroom. Let's go.

181
00:10:22,213 --> 00:10:24,443
Do you prefer ointment or cream?

182
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:25,810
Uh...

183
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,952
- Cream.
- With or without a numbing agent?

184
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,850
- Without.
- Really, Leonard?

185
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:34,787
There are no heroes
when it comes to dermatitis.

186
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,918
Fine, with.

187
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,155
- Prescription or nonprescription?
- Use your best judgment.

188
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:44,631
Well, I think I have a nice
2009 AnaMantle HC.

189
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:47,862
It's usually indicated for
acutely inflamed hemorrhoids...

190
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,533
...but it also goes nicely
with non-mucosal body parts.

191
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:57,242
- Sounds great.
- Excellent choice.

192
00:10:58,816 --> 00:11:00,647
Hurry. Hurry, hurry.

193
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,947
Come on, come on, come on.

194
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,685
Priya?

195
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:09,486
Good morning, Sheldon.

196
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,987
For shame, Leonard. For shame.

197
00:11:15,566 --> 00:11:17,295
And to think...

198
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:22,167
...I was ready to waste the last of
my good hemorrhoid cream on you.

199
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,678
Making pretty good time, huh?

200
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,246
Is that really what you wanna
talk about, Leonard?

201
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,911
- No.
- What do you wanna talk about?

202
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:40,649
Don't tell anyone I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

203
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,486
There it is.

204
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,353
What if someone asks?

205
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,158
No one will ask if I spent the night
with Raj's sister.

206
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,766
Perhaps.

207
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:52,266
But they might ask me
something else.

208
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:53,631
Like what?

209
00:11:53,805 --> 00:11:58,105
Like, "Has Leonard betrayed
any of his friends recently?"

210
00:11:58,276 --> 00:12:02,007
Priya and I are both adults.
I didn't betray Raj.

211
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,513
In fact, you did.
But I was referring to Howard.

212
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,481
- What are you talking about?
- April 12, 2005.

213
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:10,621
Bob's Big Boy, Toluca Lake.

214
00:12:10,788 --> 00:12:14,280
Raj had just introduced us
to Priya for the first time...

215
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,553
...and she was enjoying
the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion...

216
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:20,163
...in the form of
a Bob's Super Big Boy hamburger.

217
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:22,565
In order to preserve your friendship...

218
00:12:22,734 --> 00:12:24,634
...you and Howard
made a pinkie swear...

219
00:12:24,802 --> 00:12:26,235
...that neither of you
would attempt to woo her.

220
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:29,934
I had a patty melt.

221
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,070
Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.

222
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:34,006
- And Raj.
- All right. And Raj.

223
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,645
And me.

224
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,338
You?

225
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:41,417
Violation of the Roommate Agreement's
overnight guest notification clause.

226
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:46,387
Okay, fine. I'm a horrible human being.
I'm the Darth Vader of Pasadena.

227
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,889
You're far too short to be Darth Vader.

228
00:12:50,194 --> 00:12:52,890
At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.

229
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:55,322
My point is Priya's gone...

230
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,833
...and it would be much better
if no one else found out about us.

231
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,763
- You want me to keep a secret?
- Yes.

232
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:04,566
You know I can't keep a secret.

233
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,903
You can if you try.
Think about it this way:

234
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,708
Um, if I were Batman and you were Alfred,
you'd keep that secret, right?

235
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,510
Why do you get to be Batman?

236
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:16,619
Because, uh, Batman has the secret.

237
00:13:16,788 --> 00:13:19,086
- Well, Alfred has secrets too.
- Like what?

238
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,124
Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl.

239
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:25,990
Which I've now just told to Batman.
See, I cannot keep a secret.

240
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,564
Ta-da!

241
00:13:31,803 --> 00:13:32,997
What?

242
00:13:33,171 --> 00:13:34,195
Ta-da.

243
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:35,930
It's short for:

244
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,438
Da-da-ta-da.

245
00:13:38,743 --> 00:13:40,370
I'm kind of busy here, Sheldon.

246
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:42,775
I know, that's why I shortened it.

247
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:45,307
What do you want?

248
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:48,974
I came to go over your alibi
for last night.

249
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:50,711
What alibi?

250
00:13:50,888 --> 00:13:53,721
You've asked me to lie on your behalf,
and as you know...

251
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,587
...I’m deeply uncomfortable
with impromptu dishonesty.

252
00:13:56,761 --> 00:14:00,162
So I've provided you
with an ironclad alibi.

253
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:02,731
You couldn't have spent last night
with Priya...

254
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,731
...because you were with
another woman.

255
00:14:04,902 --> 00:14:10,135
Oh, I'm so sure I'm gonna regret this,
but who was I with?

256
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,176
The fun-loving and morally loose
Miss Maggie McGarry.

257
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:15,676
Oh, God.

258
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:19,943
You met her at Pasadena's most popular
Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin's...

259
00:14:20,118 --> 00:14:22,484
...where Maggie spends her nights
tending bar...

260
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,451
...with a head full of curls
and a heart full of dreams.

261
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:29,320
"Leonard, call me
if you're interested in coitus.

262
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,126
Sincerely, Maggie McGarry."

263
00:14:33,297 --> 00:14:39,532
And if anyone were to actually call
that number, they will hear this:

264
00:14:39,704 --> 00:14:42,332
Top of the morning to you.

265
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,134
You've reached Maggie McGarry.

266
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,744
Leave a message
after the wee little beep.

267
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:53,641
It's pretty convincing, huh?
That wasn't even a real person.

268
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,786
And here is the clincher.

269
00:14:55,953 --> 00:15:00,515
A lock of Maggie's
flaming auburn hair.

270
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,620
- Where'd you get that?
- From an orangutan in the Primate Lab.

271
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:05,819
An orangutan?

272
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:08,830
Well, no one's going to run
a DNA test on it, Leonard.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,831
Honestly, you over-think everything.

274
00:15:11,002 --> 00:15:14,301
Look, Sheldon. Ugh, I don't need an alibi.

275
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:18,203
Nobody's going to ask about last night
as long as you just zip your lip.

276
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,178
Thank you. Now, don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

277
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,658
- Hey.
- Hey, Leonard...

278
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,095
...will you please tell Howard
my sister's never been attracted to him?

279
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:48,700
Well, come on, Raj, how am I supposed
to know who she's attracted to?

280
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:50,841
Or was attracted to?

281
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:54,876
Or who she might be attracted to
in the future?

282
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:59,580
And I have nothing to contribute
to this conversation...

283
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,783
...because I, too, know
absolutely nothing...

284
00:16:03,955 --> 00:16:06,549
...about Priya's preferences
in male companionship.

285
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,791
And with that, I will re-zip my lip.

286
00:16:12,396 --> 00:16:15,126
What did you guys think of
Caprica last night?

287
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,530
- I didn't see it.
- Didn't see it? Heh, what were you doing?

288
00:16:22,707 --> 00:16:25,540
- L... I was out.
- What? On Caprica night?

289
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,701
Yeah, uh, I went for a drink.

290
00:16:27,878 --> 00:16:31,746
Really? Heh, you? Where'd...?
Where'd you go?

291
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,747
To, uh...

292
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,822
...Lucky Baldwin's.

293
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,757
Oh, I've heard of that place.

294
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,525
Isn't that Pasadena's
favorite Irish watering hole?

295
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:53,836
- Yes.
- Did you meet anyone interesting there?

296
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:58,135
Perhaps a promiscuous
redheaded barmaid?

297
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,574
Uh, as a matter of fact, l... l...
I can't. I can't. I can't do it.

298
00:17:01,746 --> 00:17:04,715
Sure, you can. You're doing fine.
It's very believable.

299
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:09,416
I'm sorry, Raj, but the truth is
I was with Priya last night.

300
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:10,611
Don't listen to him.

301
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:14,588
He's lightheaded from all the whiskey
and pickled eggs in his system.

302
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:17,284
- What were you doing with Priya?
- I believe coitus.

303
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:20,658
But more importantly, if Leonard
had not abandoned his story...

304
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,696
...would you have found it plausible?

305
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,836
- Did you...? You slept with my sister?
- Yeah.

306
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,994
How could you? We had a pact.

307
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,163
Excuse me, I think "She's my sister"...

308
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,969
...takes precedence over
a five-year-old pinkie swear.

309
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,972
May I point out in a parallel universe
your friends are saying:

310
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:39,378
"Maggie McGarry?
She sounds lovely."

311
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:42,947
Now, I admit it,
I may have crossed a line here.

312
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,180
But come on, Raj.
Your sister is a grown woman.

313
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,258
And to her,
I'm a forbidden piece of white chocolate.

314
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,323
I don't believe it.
This is a betrayal of my trust.

315
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,830
No, no, no. Would it help if I told you
that I offered her my heart...

316
00:17:57,001 --> 00:17:59,299
...and she kind of stomped on it?

317
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:02,128
How hard did she stomp?

318
00:18:03,007 --> 00:18:04,031
Very hard.

319
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,003
Okay, I'm good.

320
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:13,981
Okay, well, Raj, I just wanna say
that I'd never betray your trust.

321
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:16,483
Unlike Leonard, I respect you.

322
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,851
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

323
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:22,523
Was it out of respect
that you didn't tell Raj...

324
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,821
...about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

325
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,999
Dude, I put that thing on my face.

326
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,760
I think a more amusing violation
of Raj's trust...

327
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,563
...is when Howard convinced him...

328
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,138
...that foreigners give presents
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

329
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,740
Hey, I didn't see you giving back
your Snoopy Sno-Cone maker.

330
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,041
Wait, that was all a lie?
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

331
00:18:46,217 --> 00:18:47,582
As long as we're talking...

332
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,949
...how about the month Sheldon spent
grinding up insects...

333
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:52,953
...and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

334
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:55,957
Well, excuse me.
That was not a betrayal.

335
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,594
- Oh.
- That was an experiment...

336
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,256
...to determine at what concentration
food starts tasting mothy.

337
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,261
You put moths in my food?

338
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,697
For science.

339
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,704
I can't believe you kissed my sister
with moth mouth.

340
00:19:11,876 --> 00:19:15,937
Well, uh... I can't believe you'd use
Sheldon's toothbrush.

341
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,308
You used my toothbrush?

342
00:19:18,482 --> 00:19:21,246
Not the brush part.
Just the little rubber thing...

343
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,855
...to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

344
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,397
Okay, l... I think it's safe to say...

345
00:19:33,564 --> 00:19:36,727
...that we've all done some things
we're not particularly proud of.

346
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:40,226
But come on, we're friends.

347
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,895
Friends overlook each other's
minor lapses.

348
00:19:44,408 --> 00:19:47,070
For the record, Howard,
I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

349
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,479
Thank you.

350
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:53,981
And I'm sorry about your phone
and Thanksgiving.

351
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:58,616
And while we're at it, you don't have to
wash our clothes on the 4th of July.

352
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:04,587
As long as we're apologizing, Sheldon,
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

353
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:06,619
And I'm sorry...

354
00:20:06,797 --> 00:20:10,130
...but that behavior is beyond the pale
and cannot be tolerated.

355
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,201
We are no longer friends.

356
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:16,202
I got you a talking Thomas
the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.

357
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,207
With real puffing smoke?

358
00:20:19,543 --> 00:20:20,976
Yes.

359
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,513
All right.

360
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,547
But I'm watching you.

361
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,225
You got Snoopy out.
Can I have a snow cone?

362
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,360
Well, sure.

363
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:49,797
This is pretty good.
What flavor is this?

364
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,635
Guess.

365
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:53,808
- Papaya?
- No.

366
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:56,538
- Guava?
- You're so close.

367
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,877
- I give up.
- Mango caterpillar.

368
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:04,350
What are you doing?

369
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,285
You said you liked it.
