4
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:20,860
跳舞小人案

5
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,625
艾尔西 出什么事了?
Elsie, what's the matter?

6
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:45,920
艾尔西
Elsie!

7
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:24,008
看来 华生
So, Watson.

8
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:32,354
你不打算投资南非证券了?
You do not propose to invest in South African securities?

9
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,316
你怎么什么都知道?
How on earth do you know that?

10
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:39,571
好了 承认吧 你是大吃了一惊吧
Now, confess, you are utterly taken aback.

11
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:41,281
当然
I am!

12
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,325
我就该让你立字为据
I should make you sign a paper to that effect.

13
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:43,953
为什么?
Why?

14
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:47,359
因为要不了几分钟 你就会说 这也太简单了点
In a few minutes you will say it is all so absurdly simple.

15
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,416
我可说不出这样的话来
I should say nothing of the kind!

16
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,961
你要知道 我亲爱的华生 作出一连串的推理来
You see, my dear Watson, it is not really difficult

17
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:55,007
其实算不上什么难题
to construct a series of inferences,

18
00:03:55,132 --> 00:03:57,426
这些推理环环相扣
each dependent upon its predecessor

19
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,347
每一步又都清晰明了
and each simple in itself.

20
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:02,976
然后 只要把中间的环节一笔抹去
If after doing so one simply knocks out the central inferences

21
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,062
只交代给观众
and presents one's audience

22
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:07,774
他的出发点和结论
with the starting point and the conclusion,

23
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:11,611
就能看到别人瞠目结舌的样子了
one may produce a startling,

24
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:15,534
不过 这也许不过是哗众取宠而已
though possibly a meretricious, effect.

25
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:19,039
我是通过观察你
I can tell by an inspection of the groove

26
00:04:19,123 --> 00:04:21,417
左手虎口处
between your left forefinger and thumb,

27
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,671
得知你不打算把你那一小笔资金
that you have decided not to invest your small capital

28
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,506
投到金矿中去
in the gold fields.

29
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:28,884
我可看不出这有什么关系
I can see no connection.

30
00:04:29,012 --> 00:04:30,388
貌似是没有
Very likely not;

31
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:32,432
不过我这就给你看密切的联系
but I can quickly give you a close connection.

32
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:35,518
简单的线索 串起缺失的环节
Here are the missing links in the very simple chain:

33
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:37,480
你昨晚从俱乐部回来
You had chalk between your forefinger and thumb

34
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:39,316
左手虎口处粘有白色粉末
when you returned from the club last night.

35
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,237
你只有打台球时 为了减少球杆阻力 才会抹白粉
You put chalk there when you play billiards, to ease the cue.

36
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:46,867
而没有瑟斯顿作伴 你不会打台球
You never play billiards except with Thurston.

37
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,705
四周之前 你告诉过我 瑟斯顿
Now, Thurston, you told me, four weeks ago,

38
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,116
有买卖某南非证券的特权
had an option on some South African security 

39
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,042
下个月就作废
which expired in a month,

40
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,880
而他很想和你一同经营
and which he desired you to share with him.

41
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,882
你把支票簿锁在我抽屉里
Your checkbook is locked in my drawer,

42
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,175
也没问我要钥匙
and you have not asked for the key.

43
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,680
所以说 你不打算对此投资
So, you do not propose to invest your money in that manner.

44
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:08,603
这也太简单了点
How absurdly simple!

45
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:13,944
一点不假
Quite so.

46
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:17,699
只要跟你解释过 什么问题都变简单了
Every problem is absurdly simple when it is explained to you.

47
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,706
福尔摩斯 你干吗这么高兴?
Holmes, why are you so cheerful?

48
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,250
你正在待业 没案子可破
You're unemployed, you have no case to solve.

49
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:29,256
换在平时 你肯定心情低落
Now, normally that produces black moods

50
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,343
凄凄惨惨 以可卡因消愁
and the infernal lethargy of the cocaine bottle.

51
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,931
你就是不懂什么是逻辑思维
You have not used the logical principles

52
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:37,350
亏我整天跟你耳提面命
which I constantly expound.

53
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:42,816
福尔摩斯展目舒眉
Sherlock Holmes is cheerful,

54
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:46,820
那就是说 夏洛克福尔摩斯大案在手
so, Sherlock Holmes must have a case.

55
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,574
对了
Pa!

56
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:54,997
看看你能看出什么门道来 华生老友
See what you can make of that, friend Watson.

57
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,668
福尔摩斯 这不就是小孩的涂鸦吗?
Why, Holmes, it's a child's drawing.

58
00:05:57,795 --> 00:05:59,005
你就是这么想的?
Ah, is that your idea?

59
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,506
那还能是什么?
Well, what else should it be?

60
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,508
这位达比郡瑞都岭镇庄园的
Well, that is what a Mr. Hilton Cubitt,

61
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:06,055
希尔顿丘比特先生也很想知道
of Ridling Thorpe Manor, Darbyshire, is anxious to know.

62
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,683
这个谜是早班邮件送到的
That conundrum came by the first post,

63
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,355
他本人坐随后的火车赶来
and he is to follow by the next train.

64
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:32,923
希尔顿丘比特
Hilton Cubitt.

65
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,593
别费事了 我都查过了 华生
No, no, I have already looked him up, Watson.

66
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,890
他的家族在达比郡拥有领地已经有500年了
His family has owned land in Darbyshire for over 500 years,

67
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:44,395
所以我想 丘比特先生一定有财有势
so I presume that Mr. Cubitt is as respectable as he is worthy.

68
00:06:45,732 --> 00:06:49,152
容光焕发 神朗气清
With a fresh face, an open countenance,

69
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:52,366
还戴着棕色圆顶礼帽
and wearing a brown bowler hat.

70
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,701
别开玩笑了 你怎么可能知道这么详细
Oh, no, you cannot possibly know that.

71
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:56,330
不相信 福尔摩斯?
Really, Holmes?

72
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,341
你会留在这儿记录案子吧?
Uh, you will stay and keep a record of the case?

73
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,719
赴汤蹈火
My dear fellow.

74
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,356
多谢 哈德逊太太
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

75
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,067
这边请 丘比特先生
This way, Mr. Cubitt.

76
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,198
我就是夏洛克福尔摩斯
Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

77
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:24,241
希尔顿丘比特
Hilton Cubitt.

78
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,034
这是我的好友兼同事华生大夫
And this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

79
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,037
华生大夫 你好
Dr. Watson, sir.

80
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:29,657
荣幸之至 请坐吧 丘比特先生
How do you do? Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

81
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,333
谢谢
Thank you.

82
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,883
什么结果 先生们 你们觉得这东西是什么?
So, what do you make of it, gentlemen? This thing.

83
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,471
您研究过了吗?
Have you had time to study it?

84
00:07:40,596 --> 00:07:42,348
可笑的小人排着队跳舞
Absurd little figures dancing in a line,

85
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:44,809
孩子信笔涂抹的结果
it's a childish prank.

86
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:47,230
这点小事 你为什么觉得重要?
Why do you attach importance to something so trivial?

87
00:07:47,314 --> 00:07:48,523
不是我 福尔摩斯
I don't, Mr. Holmes.

88
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,483
我肯定不会
I-I never should.

89
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,322
其实...是我的妻子
No, it's-it'sit's my wife, you see.

90
00:07:53,447 --> 00:07:54,823
她...
She-

91
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:58,076
尽管说 丘比特先生 都不是外人
Go on, Mr. Cubitt, you're with friends.

92
00:07:58,162 --> 00:08:01,040
这东西吓得她要命
But it's-it's frightened her almost to death.

93
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,292
她什么都不说 装作若无其事
She says nothing, tries to appear normal,

94
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:09,927
但我从没见过谁会这么慌张
but I've never seen anyone so upset.

95
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,805
这和原先用白粉笔画在院子长椅上的一模一样?
In white chalk on a garden seat, it is a precise copy?

96
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,350
我尽可能画得一模一样了
Oh, it's as exact as I could make it.

97
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:17,062
我的确以为是马童画的
I did think it might be the stable boy,

98
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:19,606
但那孩子说没画过
but the lad denied it.

99
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:21,941
要是我妻子有危险 福尔摩斯先生
If there's any danger threatening my wife, Mr. Holmes,

100
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:25,864
我倾家荡产也要保护她
I'd spend my last penny to protect her.

101
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:28,283
丘比特先生 您请坐吧
Do sit down, Mr. Cubitt.

102
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,538
抽烟吗 丘比特先生?
Do you smoke, Mr. Cubitt?

103
00:08:31,664 --> 00:08:32,289
好的
Uh, yes.

104
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:35,834
哦 不 不 我不抽 谢谢
Uh, no, no, no, I won't, thank you.

105
00:08:40,593 --> 00:08:47,352
说说您夫人吧 丘比特先生
Tell us about your wife, Mr. Cubitt.

106
00:08:47,435 --> 00:08:51,398
好吧 我一直都住在达比郡
Well, uh, I've always lived in Darbyshire,

107
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:54,317
靠近马特洛克的瑞都岭镇庄园里
Ridling Thorpe Manor, near Matlock.

108
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,655
我一直是个单身汉 要不是三年前
I was a bachelor and thought I'd remain one

109
00:08:56,738 --> 00:09:00,367
去了趟伦敦 还以为会一辈子孤家寡人了
until three years ago I came down to London on a visit.

110
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:03,247
真是做梦也没想到
It's a rare thing for me, but-

111
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:07,042
我是打算去看看女王即位五十周年大典
well, I had a mind to see the Queen's Golden Jubilee.

112
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:09,505
我在罗素广场有寄宿处
I put up at a boardinghouse in Russell Square,

113
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:12,591
因为帕克 我们的教区牧师
because Parker, he's the vicar of our parish,

114
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,221
他待在那儿
he was staying there.

115
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:19,225
当时在那儿的还有一位年轻的美国姑娘
There was also a young American lady staying there,

116
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,647
她姓帕特里克 艾尔西帕特里克
Patrick was her name, Elsie Patrick.

117
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:25,817
我们都没个伴儿 就交上了朋友
We were both alone, and we became friends,

118
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:27,279
一起结伴同游之类
did the sites and that.

119
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,239
你出的钱?
At your expense?

120
00:09:29,322 --> 00:09:30,615
当然不是
Certainly not.

121
00:09:30,741 --> 00:09:31,408
你难不成以为...
Are you suggesting-

122
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:35,414
没有 丘比特先生 绝无此意
No, he's not, Mr. Cubitt, not at all.

123
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:42,506
这位帕特里克小姐来伦敦 就为看女王大典?
Was this Miss Elsie Patrick in London merely for the Jubilee?

124
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,426
不 不 不是 她到伦敦有一阵子了
No, no, no, she'd been here some time.

125
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,680
她厌倦了美国 四处游历
She'd tired of America, traveled about,

126
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:50,767
最后在英国落了脚
and finally settled in England.

127
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:55,940
不用多说了 等到假期结束
Well, not to make a labor of it, before my holiday was over,

128
00:09:56,066 --> 00:10:00,195
我就成了个恋爱中的男人
I was as much in love as any man ever has been.

129
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:02,657
让我喜出望外的是 她...
To my surprise and joy, she-

130
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:06,955
她和我两情相悦 我们就结了婚
she reciprocated my feelings, and we were married.

131
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,290
善莫大焉
Excellent.

132
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,919
没张扬 就去登了个记
Quietly, in ain a Register Office.

133
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,799
你准是当我疯了 福尔摩斯先生 没认识两天
You think I'm mad, Mr. Holmes, taking a wife in such a fashion,

134
00:10:14,924 --> 00:10:17,760
心血来潮就把婚结了?
knowing nothing about her?

135
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:22,558
解释吧 丘比特先生 说重点
Explain, Mr. Cubitt, and come to the point!

136
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:30,237
哦 是的 其实 就在我们结婚那天
Oh, uh, yes, in fact, it was on the very day of our marriage.

137
00:10:30,362 --> 00:10:35,951
那时我觉得一切都好 没有一丝不快
Nothing could have made me unhappy, nothing on that day.

138
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:39,790
但现在想想 还真有些奇怪
But now I look back, it was odd.

139
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,505
艾尔西?
Elsie?

140
00:10:44,588 --> 00:10:47,425
有些话我得跟你说 希尔顿
There is something I have to say to you, Hilton.

141
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:49,679
我们可别晚了 亲爱的
We don't want to be late, my dear.

142
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:51,973
我一直拖到现在
I've put it off till now.

143
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:56,894
但我还是要给你个重新考虑的机会
But I must still give you the chance to change your mind.

144
00:10:57,021 --> 00:11:00,525
艾尔西 有这么严重吗?
Elsie, what in the world?

145
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,863
听我说完
Let me finish!

146
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:06,783
我说的字字属实
And what I say, I do mean.

147
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,580
我很爱你
I love you dearly,

148
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:13,584
但你对我之前的经历一无所知
but you know nothing of my life before we met.

149
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,088
我没有问啊
I never asked.

150
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:20,968
这也是我这么爱你的原因之一
One of the things which has made me so fond of you.

151
00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:24,724
如果你娶了我 希尔顿 我保证 你娶的女人
If you marry me, Hilton, I promise you marry a woman

152
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:29,479
从没有做过任何事会让你感到羞耻
who has nothing personally to be ashamed of.

153
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,233
但你要按我说的做
But you'll have to take my word for it,

154
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,613
永远不要过问
and allow me to be silent forever

155
00:11:34,738 --> 00:11:38,867
我们相遇前我的生活
as to my life before we met.

156
00:11:38,952 --> 00:11:41,288
要是你觉得这太过分
If that's too much to ask,

157
00:11:41,413 --> 00:11:43,791
那还是请您回达比郡
then you must go back to your Darbyshire

158
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:48,297
留下我一个人 就当未曾遇见过您
and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.

159
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:54,806
一点不过分 我永远不会让你离开我
It's little enough to ask, and I shall never let you go.

160
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:01,606
就这样 我度过了最幸福的三年
These have been the happiest three years of my life.

161
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:03,858
那么 自何时起
And when did the first cloud

162
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:10,327
开始有愁云蔽日呢?
cover the sun of this great happiness?

163
00:12:10,411 --> 00:12:12,621
您还真一针见血 福尔摩斯先生
You have a way of putting things, Mr. Holmes.

164
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:13,414
您也很擅长
And you have a way

165
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:16,125
顾左右而言他 丘比特先生
of prevaricating with your answers, Mr. Cubitt.

166
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:21,590
好吧 是几个月前 确切的说是五月
Well, it was, uh, some months ago, May in fact.

167
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,348
希尔顿?
Hilton?!

168
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,517
来了
Hello!

169
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:32,897
在这儿 客厅
Here, in the drawing room!

170
00:12:36,194 --> 00:12:37,696
看看 喜欢吗?
Well, what do you think?

171
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:41,324
真不错 焕然一新了
Yes, great improvement!

172
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,415
谢谢 桑德斯
Thank you, Saunders.

173
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,380
我遇见了邮差 没让他再跑一趟
I met the postman, saved him a journey.

174
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,009
有账单
Here's a bill.

175
00:12:55,094 --> 00:12:59,682
还有封你的信 美国邮戳 从芝加哥
Here's one for you, an American stamp, Chicago.

176
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,900
希望午饭好了 我饿死了
I hope lunch is ready, I'm ravenous.

177
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:35,772
她烧掉了信 拆都没拆?
She burned the letter, unopened?

178
00:13:35,855 --> 00:13:39,400
是啊 我不知道为什么
Yes, I don't know why.

179
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,613
你当然不知道
Of course you don't.

180
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,367
美国是她的过去 是你不容打破的誓言
America is her past, and the subject of a solemn promise.

181
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:49,289
是啊 可从那以后 她就一直心神不定
Yes, but she's not had an easy hour from that moment.

182
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,626
要是她信得过我
If only she'd trust me.

183
00:13:52,753 --> 00:13:57,383
我对她是一百个信任 这点你得相信我
Now, I have every faith in her, you must believe that.

184
00:13:57,468 --> 00:14:01,722
不管她的过去怎么样 我肯定那都不是她的错
Whatever there was in her past, I'm sure it's no fault of hers.

185
00:14:01,806 --> 00:14:03,933
说说跳舞的小人
And the dancing men?

186
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,980
哦 好吧
Oh, yes,

187
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:09,607
我以为她已经忘了那封信的事了
well, I thought she was getting over the letter,

188
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,945
结果这些小人又跳出来了
and then thesethese drawings appeared.

189
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:14,114
不过就是孩子随笔乱画
It's just a childish scrawl,

190
00:14:14,197 --> 00:14:16,783
可什么都每况愈下了
but it made everything worse than before.

191
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,621
我可不能就这么看着
Well, I couldn't just leave it.

192
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,540
这事还不能跟警察说
And it wasn't the sort of thing I could take to the police

193
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:25,252
他们准会笑话我
for they would have laughed at me,

194
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:28,299
所以我来找你了
so I've come to you.

195
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:33,222
丘比特先生 您想过没有
Don't you think, Mr. Cubitt,

196
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:34,766
最好的解决办法
that your best plan would be

197
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,728
就是直接问您的夫人
to make a direct appeal to your wife,

198
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,814
请她与您分担心中的秘密?
and ask her to share her secret with you?

199
00:14:39,898 --> 00:14:43,109
君子一言 驷马难追 福尔摩斯先生
A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes.

200
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:46,031
要是艾尔西打算告诉我 她会的
If Elsie wishes to tell me, then she will.

201
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,534
我可没这个权利去打听隐私
But I have no right to force a confidence.

202
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,793
不过 作为丈夫 我也会尽职尽责的 我会的
However, I do feel entitled to take my own line, and I will.

203
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,021
那我也会全力以赴帮助您的
Then I will help you with all my heart.

204
00:15:10,104 --> 00:15:12,982
您有没有看到附近有什么陌生人出现过?
Have you seen or heard of any strangers in the neighborhood?

205
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,486
没有 没见过
No, no, I haven't.

206
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:15,946
有些农户会收些房客
Some of the farmers take in lodgers,

207
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,449
不过最近倒是没怎么听说
but I've not heard of any lately.

208
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:23,413
那我建议您先回达比郡吧 丘比特先生
Then I suggest that you return to Darbyshire, Mr. Cubitt,

209
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,082
眼睛放亮些
and keep a sharp lookout.

210
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:26,333
再有新的跳舞小人
And make an exact copy

211
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,879
一定要准确无误地记下给我
of any fresh dancing men that may appear.

212
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:32,007
谢谢 福尔摩斯先生 我会的
Thank you, Mr. Holmes. I will.

213
00:15:32,093 --> 00:15:34,470
对了 丘比特先生
Oh, and Mr. Cubitt,

214
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,849
让您夫人辗转难侧的那第一封信
this letter which started your wife's torment,

215
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:40,979
您确信是从美国寄来的?
you are quite certain that it was from the United States?

216
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:44,440
没错 邮戳是芝加哥
Yeah, the postmark was Chicago.

217
00:15:53,787 --> 00:16:00,171
再会 不用担心
Goodbye! And don't worry.

218
00:16:22,743 --> 00:16:23,535
她从美国收到信件
It's perfectly natural

219
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,996
也没什么不正常的
she should receive a letter from America,

220
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,206
她不就是美国来的
she's from America.

221
00:16:27,331 --> 00:16:30,667
没错 但拆都没拆就烧掉就不正常了
Yes, but it is not natural to throw it onto the fire unopened.

222
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,137
这么看上去还有点像旗语了
It's beginning to look like semaphore.

223
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,140
你读了我写的密码专论了?
You have read my monograph on secret ciphers?

224
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:43,019
翻了翻
Some of it.

225
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:45,522
读起来太艰深了
I found it rather heavy going.

226
00:16:45,647 --> 00:16:48,066
不用问 这肯定代表着什么
It evidently has a meaning.

227
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:53,156
这要真是信手画的 那可就是匪夷所思了
If it is purely arbitrary, it may be impossible to solve.

228
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:58,036
不过 只要这有规可循
However, if it is systematic,

229
00:16:58,163 --> 00:17:01,333
我们就能拨开云雾见青天
we should be able to get to the bottom of it.

230
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,881
但我们还需要更多的信息 越长越好
But we need more messages, and preferably long ones.

231
00:17:05,965 --> 00:17:09,885
我觉得希尔顿丘比特可不这么希望
Well, I doubt if Hilton Cubitt would agree with that.

232
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:53,278
沃克
Walker,

233
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,581
你见过这东西吗?
do you know anything about this?

234
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,624
没有 先生
No, sir.

235
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,794
我一整天没来前面了
I've not been out in the front all day.

236
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,588
丘比特夫人来过这儿吗?
Has Mrs. Cubitt been out here?

237
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:12,384
这我也不知道 是吧 先生?
I've no way of knowing, have I, sir?

238
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,639
等我抄完 我希望你能把这儿擦干净
When I've done this, I want you to wash it off,

239
00:18:14,764 --> 00:18:17,558
别跟任何人说 直接来找我
and tell no one about it, and then come to me.

240
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:21,814
我需要你帮我送封急信
I shall have an urgent letter for you to post.

241
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:48,724
艾尔西?
Elsie?

242
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:34,534
艾尔西
Elsie,

243
00:19:34,661 --> 00:19:36,121
你在干吗?
what are you doing?

244
00:19:36,246 --> 00:19:38,123
我正在找你
I was looking for you.

245
00:19:40,127 --> 00:19:43,005
我想刚才是开门的声音
I thought I heard the door.

246
00:19:43,088 --> 00:19:48,427
你今天出门了吗 出这房子了吗?
Have you been out today, out of the house?

247
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:06,993
希尔顿 上床去吧
Hilton, come to bed,

248
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,290
一觉睡醒什么都会好的
everything will look better in the morning.

249
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:13,587
那些画也会好?
Will the drawings look better?!

250
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,131
那些跳舞的小人也会好?
Will the dancing men look better?!

251
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,718
你干吗为这些涂鸦大惊小怪?
Why do they fuss you so?

252
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,428
我大惊小怪?
Fuss me?!

253
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:22,890
不过是玩笑 孩子的恶作剧
They're just a joke, a bit of mischief!

254
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:35,490
月正中天
The moon's high.

255
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:44,128
在美国 人们说这样的月亮会让人发狂
Where I come from, they say a moon like that drives you crazy.

256
00:20:58,438 --> 00:21:02,358
去旅行好吗 希尔顿 离开这儿好吗?
Why don't we travel, Hilton, why don't we go away?

257
00:21:16,045 --> 00:21:22,470
我爱这儿 跟我爱你一样
I love this place as much as I love you.

258
00:21:22,553 --> 00:21:26,182
希尔顿...
Hilton-

259
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,687
你看到什么了?
What did you see?

260
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,190
没什么 什么都没有
Nothing, nothing at all!

261
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:34,319
不要去 亲爱的
Please, dearest.

262
00:21:36,154 --> 00:21:37,197
希尔顿 求你了
Hilton, I beg you!

263
00:21:37,322 --> 00:21:40,033
外面有人
There's somebody outside.

264
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,037
希尔顿
Hilton!

265
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,165
希尔顿 等等
Hilton, wait!

266
00:21:45,251 --> 00:21:47,211
你会干出伤人的事的
You'll come to harm!

267
00:21:47,294 --> 00:21:51,257
你就不担心他会干出伤人的事?
Or are you afraid he will come to harm?!

268
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:12,075
这两个一模一样
These two are identical.

269
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:13,579
是啊
Yes.

270
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,289
我把那个擦掉过
Well, I had that one washed off,

271
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,541
这肯定是后来又画上去的
then it must have reappeared.

272
00:22:17,626 --> 00:22:20,588
要是你看清楚那家伙就好了
You know, it's a pity you didn't get a closer look at this chap.

273
00:22:20,671 --> 00:22:22,840
要是她没拦着我
If only she hadn't tried to stop me.

274
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,719
我从来没冲她发过脾气
I've never been angry with her before,

275
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:27,471
可她知道外头那人是谁 这我肯定
but she knew who was out there, of that I'm sure.

276
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:31,309
她也知道这些小人是什么意思
And she knows what these figures mean.

277
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:33,980
这些是不是只是后来加上去的内容
Was this a mere addition to this,

278
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,482
还是说这两个是两条不同的信息?
or did it appear to be entirely separate?

279
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:39,738
这个是画在另一块门板上的
That was on a separate panel of the door.

280
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,170
好吧 我知道我该做什么了
Well, I know what I'm going to do,

281
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:53,213
我该回家
I shall go home,

282
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,925
跟我的人在树林里守株待兔
sit with half a dozen of my lads in the shrubbery,

283
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,719
要是再看到这家伙露面
and if this fellow calls again,

284
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,472
打他个屁滚尿流 以后再也别来烦我们
give him such a thrashing he'll leave us alone in the future.

285
00:22:59,555 --> 00:23:01,098
这倒也是个办法
Well, that would be one way.

286
00:23:01,184 --> 00:23:08,860
丘比特先生 这案子有隐情 绝不可草率
Mr. Cubitt, this case is too deep for such a simple remedy.

287
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:12,030
我得走了 不然要错过火车了
I must go now if I'm to catch my train.

288
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:13,865
我可不会让艾尔西一个人晚上待着
I'd not leave Elsie alone at night.

289
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:14,701
艾尔西
Elsie!

290
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,078
没错
Quite right.

291
00:23:16,203 --> 00:23:18,622
走好 丘比特先生
Good day, Mr. Cubitt.

292
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:22,209
我们一两天就会去见你了 耐心点
We will join you in a couple of days, and be patient!

293
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:23,504
再见 华生大夫
Good bye, Dr. Watson.

294
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:25,047
不用你送我了
I'll find my own way.

295
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,007
再见
Bye.

296
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,682
我可看不出来你有同情心
You weren't exactly sympathetic.

297
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:36,020
他不是要我同情他的
He doesn't come to me for sympathy.

298
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,415
很有挑战性
It is a considerable challenge.

299
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:54,545
安静才能让我更好的工作
I shall work better for silence.

300
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,213
那好吧
Oh, well,

301
00:23:56,297 --> 00:24:00,759
我敢说我也能找到些安静的事去做
I dare say I can find something quiet to do.

302
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:43,441
吁
Whoa, sit.

303
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:44,486
你在哪儿找到的这个?
Where did you find this?

304
00:24:44,611 --> 00:24:46,821
就在院子里长椅边上
Down by the garden bench.

305
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:47,781
那是不是说
Will that, uh, mean

306
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:52,786
你要让我再送一封信去伦敦了 先生?
you'll be wanting me to take another letter for London, sir?

307
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,957
是吗?
Very well.

308
00:24:56,126 --> 00:24:58,253
要赶最后一班车 我得马上动身
I'll have to get a move on if I'm gonna catch the last post.

309
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:02,508
沃克 让你做什么你再做什么
Walker, just do what you're told!

310
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,146
什么事 华生?
Yes, Watson?

311
00:25:12,271 --> 00:25:16,484
我想你可能会想看泰晤士报 福尔摩斯
Uh, I thought you might like the Times, Holmes.

312
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:20,281
你认为我进展如何?
What do you make of my progress?

313
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:23,412
也没弄出个所以然来 对吧?
Well, it still doesn't mean very much, does it?

314
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:28,000
多的足够让我给美国发个电报了
Quite enough for me to send a telegram to the United States.

315
00:25:28,085 --> 00:25:31,213
"ABESLANE" 这是什么意思?
What on earth does that mean, "ABESLANE"?

316
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:36,176
华生 想想 要是这是E
Watson, if this is E,

317
00:25:36,262 --> 00:25:38,848
手拿旗子表示单词结束
flag denotes the end of words.

318
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:35,422
这松鸡太好吃了
Mm, this grouse is superb.

319
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:41,512
哈德逊太太可是超常发挥了这回
Mrs. Hudson has really surpassed herself this time.

320
00:26:41,639 --> 00:26:44,767
最晚一班去马特洛克的火车是几点?
What time is the last train to Matlock?

321
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:46,688
恐怕我们错过了
I'm afraid we've missed it.

322
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:55,115
福尔摩斯 我真希望你能吃上一口
Holmes, I do wish you would try and eat a bite.

323
00:26:55,242 --> 00:26:59,705
我只需要美国方面给我个回信
I just need an answer to my telegram from America,

324
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,457
来龙去脉就搞清楚了
and the story is complete.

325
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,463
亚伯 我想留下 我要留下
Abe, I wanna stay, and I'm going to stay.

326
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:44,174
那你在芝加哥的朋友怎么办?
What about your friends in Chicago?

327
00:28:44,301 --> 00:28:46,137
你的家人怎么办?
What about your family?!

328
00:28:46,262 --> 00:28:47,847
你管他们叫朋友?
Friends do you call them;

329
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:51,934
一帮子凶手 劫匪 勒索犯 那算什么家?
killers, robbers, extortionists, some family.

330
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:54,188
可咱们两个订婚了
But you and I were engaged!

331
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:57,900
对不起 亚伯 那是父亲强迫我答应的
I'm sorry, Abe, my father forced me into it.

332
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,989
跟你过那种生活 要我怎么能开心?
How could I be happy with you in that life?!

333
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:09,291
请你离开吧 求你了 我求你了
Please go away, please, I beg you.

334
00:29:09,376 --> 00:29:11,128
你求我?
You beg me?!

335
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:13,005
是
Yes.

336
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,173
希尔顿这么好
Hilton is such a good man.

337
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,971
要是让他卷入丑闻 我会心碎的
It would break my heart if scandal ever touched him.

338
00:29:19,055 --> 00:29:21,974
给你钱
Here's money,

339
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,895
都在这儿了
it's all that I have.

340
00:29:36,328 --> 00:29:37,120
不
No!

341
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:37,788
你要跟我回家
You're coming home!

342
00:29:37,871 --> 00:29:38,371
不
No!

343
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:38,955
你得跟我回去
You're coming home!

344
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:39,833
不
No!

345
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,252
真他...
What the-

346
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:43,253
不
No!

347
00:29:49,303 --> 00:29:50,679
华生?
Watson?

348
00:29:53,101 --> 00:29:55,561
该死的 出什么事了?
What the devil is going on?

349
00:29:57,397 --> 00:29:58,648
你的电报有回音了?
An answer to your telegram?

350
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:02,362
不 是希尔顿丘比特的另一封信
No, it's another letter from Hilton Cubitt.

351
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:13,917
"艾尔西
"ELSIE

352
00:30:14,044 --> 00:30:16,922
准...备"
PRE-P ARE."

353
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:37,569
"艾尔西 准备 见上"
ELSIE-RE-ARE-TO-MEET-THY-GO

354
00:30:37,993 --> 00:30:39,035
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes, sir.

355
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:41,204
多谢
Thank you.

356
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,671
芝加哥警局的威尔逊哈格里夫
It's from Wilson Hargreave, of the Chicago Police Bureau.

357
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:48,756
"如您所问"
"In reply to your inquiry,

358
00:30:48,841 --> 00:30:51,510
"亚伯斯拉内是芝加哥最险恶的人之一"
Abe Slaney is one of the most dangerous men in Chicago. "

359
00:30:54,805 --> 00:30:56,932
快走 快走
Come along, come along.

360
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:02,817
有辆车
There's a cab!

361
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:04,319
去瑞都岭镇庄园 上车吗?
Ridling Thorpe Manor, gentlemen?

362
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,321
越快越好
As fast as you can!

363
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,743
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

364
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,412
我打赌你是伦敦来的法医 先生
Bet you're the surgeon from London, sir.

365
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:13,747
对不起 你干吗...
I beg your pardon, what makes you-

366
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,209
她还没死 先生
She's not dead yet, sir.

367
00:31:15,334 --> 00:31:20,047
你也许能救她 不过她还是要上绞架的
You may be able to save her, but she's for the gallows.

368
00:31:20,174 --> 00:31:21,592
绞架?
The gallows?!

369
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:25,054
没错 先生 她杀了自己的丈夫
Right, sir, she murdered her husband.

370
00:31:56,971 --> 00:32:00,808
我想 来的是警长和医生吧
Inspector of Police, and Doctor of Medicine, I perceive?

371
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:04,522
的确如此 我是达比郡警署的探长马丁
Yes, indeed, Inspector Martin, Darbyshire Constabulary.

372
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:07,402
我是医生卡休
And I am Dr. Carthew, the surgeon.

373
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:08,486
先生们 这边请
This way, gentlemen.

374
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,322
这位是夏洛克福尔摩斯先生
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

375
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:15,871
我是他的朋友兼同事华生大夫
and I am his friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

376
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:22,963
福尔摩斯先生 这事你又知道些什么呢?
Mr. Holmes, but what do you know of this business?!

377
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:25,340
不少
A good deal.

378
00:32:25,426 --> 00:32:29,346
希尔顿丘比特先生 曾是我的客户
Mr. Hilton Cubitt was my client.

379
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,558
可这案子今天凌晨三点才发生的
But the crime was only committed at 3:00 o'clock this morning.

380
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:33,853
你在伦敦是怎么听到风声的
How could you hear of it in London

381
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,396
我前脚进 你后脚就到了?
and get to the spot as soon as I?

382
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,898
我预料到了
I anticipated it.

383
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:41,696
我们原打算来阻止这一切
We came in hope of preventing it.

384
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,906
那你一定是拿到了
Then you must have important evidence

385
00:32:43,033 --> 00:32:44,576
我不知道的证据了
of which I am ignorant.

386
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,995
只有跳舞的小人为证
Only the evidence of the dancing men.

387
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:47,704
跳舞的小人?
The dancing men?

388
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:50,791
我稍后会跟你解释
I will explain all that to you later.

389
00:32:51,585 --> 00:32:55,756
既然我们已经无法阻止悲剧
Since we are too late to prevent this tragedy,

390
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:59,053
我一定要保证正义得到伸张
I am anxious to insure that justice is done.

391
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,055
您愿意协助我调查
Will you associate me in your investigation,

392
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:03,599
还是更乐意让我独自行动?
or will you prefer that I should act independently?

393
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:07,939
我很荣幸能和您协同办案 福尔摩斯先生
I should be proud for us to work together, Mr. Holmes.

394
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,194
但丑话说在前面 看起来没什么东西好调查的
But I must warn you, there seems very little to investigate.

395
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:15,657
希尔顿丘比特先生心脏中弹 已经死亡
Mr. Hilton Cubitt has been shot through the heart and he's dead.

396
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:21,665
那丘比特夫人呢?
And Mrs. Cubitt?

397
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,253
重伤
Seriously wounded.

398
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,088
子弹穿过头顶
The bullet passed through the front of her brain,

399
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,674
至今昏迷不醒
and she's still unconscious.

400
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:31,011
请 先生们
Excuse me, gentlemen.

401
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:36,600
只发现了一把枪 就在两个人中间
Only one gun has been found, lying on the floor between them.

402
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:38,771
共开了两枪
Two bullets have been fired.

403
00:33:38,855 --> 00:33:39,897
福尔摩斯先生 我冒昧地说句
With respect, Mr. Holmes,

404
00:33:40,024 --> 00:33:42,735
看上去一目了然 丘比特太太杀了她丈夫
it seems quite clear that Mrs. Cubitt murdered her husband

405
00:33:42,861 --> 00:33:45,238
然后又掉转了枪口
and then turned the gun upon herself.

406
00:33:45,363 --> 00:33:48,741
可他们是这么相亲相爱的一对
But they were a most devoted couple!

407
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,996
谋杀现场在这边的屋子 福尔摩斯先生
The murder room is through here, Mr. Holmes.

408
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:56,042
不用 我想先问问这里的佣人
No, I would like to start by interviewing the servants.

409
00:33:56,128 --> 00:33:56,962
我请您 不要
And I beg you, nothing,

410
00:33:57,045 --> 00:34:00,424
千万不要移动任何东西
absolutely nothing is to be moved.

411
00:34:04,513 --> 00:34:07,183
厨房是从这儿走吗?
Is this the way to the kitchen?

412
00:34:12,192 --> 00:34:14,194
我得说这案子肯定是
I should think it must have happened about

413
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:18,323
早上三点发生的 先生
3:00 o'clock in the morning, sir.

414
00:34:18,408 --> 00:34:19,951
你们的房间在哪儿?
Where are your rooms?

415
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:20,744
顶楼 先生
On top, sir.

416
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:21,995
阁楼
The attics!

417
00:34:22,078 --> 00:34:24,372
我被那声可怕的"砰"惊醒了
I was awoke by this terrible bang,

418
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:27,377
只能用爆炸来形容
an explosion is the only word.

419
00:34:27,461 --> 00:34:28,629
大约过了一分钟...
And about a minute later-

420
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:29,296
还没到一分钟
It was less than a minute.

421
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:33,050
...又传来"砰"的一声 不过没那么响
-there was another bang, only not so loud.

422
00:34:33,135 --> 00:34:34,720
你们做什么了?
What did you do?

423
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:36,430
我们下楼了 先生
We came downstairs, sir,

424
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:38,559
以为丘比特先生也会起身
expecting to find Mr. Cubitt up and about,

425
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:41,562
追逐窃贼或是发现哪儿着了火
chasing burglars or the house on fire, or-

426
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:43,606
但是卧室门开着
And the bedroom door was open.

427
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:47,237
我们看看了 发现屋子空着 就下来了
We looked in but the bed was empty so we came on down.

428
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,071
到处是烟
There was smoke,

429
00:34:48,196 --> 00:34:49,989
越往下气味越重
and the smell was worse down here.

430
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:52,244
气味?
Smell?

431
00:34:52,327 --> 00:34:54,162
啊 你是说枪的硝烟味?
Ah, you mean of the gunpowder?

432
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,249
我想就是 先生 是的
I suppose it was, sir, yes.

433
00:34:57,376 --> 00:34:59,086
刚才你说越往下气味越重
Now, you say the smell was worse downstairs.

434
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:01,338
你在楼上也能闻到硝烟的味儿?
Could you also smell gunpowder upstairs?

435
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:03,257
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

436
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,093
我提醒您 探长
I commend that fact

437
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:06,929
需要十分留意这一点
very carefully to your attention, Inspector.

438
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:09,098
金太太
Mrs. King,

439
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:16,482
您愿意坐下来谈吗 金太太?
would you like to sit down, Mrs. King?

440
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:23,741
那么 您到书房的时候 书房的门是开着的吗?
Now, was the library door open when you reached it?

441
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:25,912
开着的 先生
Open, yes, sir.

442
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:29,708
我们能看到桌上还亮着蜡烛 就走进去了
We could see the candle alight on the table and so we came in.

443
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:33,714
接着 哦 天啊
Then, oh dear,

444
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:38,137
那是我见过最可怕 也最怕见到的一幕
as terrible a thing as ever I saw or ever fear to see.

445
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,890
她受了重伤 先生
She was terrible wounded, sir.

446
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:43,060
不停地呻吟
She was moaning and groaning,

447
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:44,937
然后就瘫倒在地上
then she sort of collapsed on the floor

448
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:48,441
之后就再也没能开口说话
and she hasn't said anything since.

449
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:51,487
桑德斯?
Saunders?

450
00:35:51,613 --> 00:35:53,531
我们把她抬到了卧室 先生
We moved her to her bedroom, sir,

451
00:35:53,617 --> 00:35:56,870
然后让福瑞德沃克去叫了医生和警察
and sent Fred Walker for the doctor and the police.

452
00:35:58,038 --> 00:36:03,502
没有发现破门而入的痕迹 或是潜入的人?
And there was no sign of a break-in, or of an intruder?

453
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:04,671
没有 先生
No, sir.

454
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:06,425
所有的门和窗都是锁上的
And all the doors and windows was locked,

455
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,637
就跟我们去就寝时一样
as we had left them when we went to bed.

456
00:36:11,224 --> 00:36:13,559
探长...
Inspector...

457
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:16,062
哦 好的
Oh, yes...

458
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:20,985
除了可怜的丘比特夫人
Apart from poor Mrs. Cubitt,

459
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:22,820
你们没有动过其他东西?
nothing else has been moved?

460
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:23,696
没有 先生
No, sir.

461
00:36:23,823 --> 00:36:27,577
没有 我们什么都没碰 福尔摩斯先生
No, we've touched nothing, Mr. Holmes.

462
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:30,705
谢谢你们 那么我们继续吧
Thank you. Then I think we can proceed.

463
00:36:37,216 --> 00:36:40,970
几乎是顷刻毙命 可以这么假定
Almost instantaneous death, presumably.

464
00:36:41,095 --> 00:36:44,557
直穿心脏
Mm, straight through the heart.

465
00:36:44,684 --> 00:36:48,980
子弹还在里面
The bullet's still there.

466
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:52,402
那颗伤了丘比特夫人的子弹呢?
What about the bullet that wounded Mrs. Cubitt?

467
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,696
也还在她体内呢
That's still in her, as well.

468
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,783
得找个比我灵活的人才能取出来
It will take hands more nimble than mine to move it.

469
00:37:00,745 --> 00:37:03,123
这是丘比特夫人的手提袋吗?
Is this Mrs. Cubitt's handbag?

470
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,961
没错 福尔摩斯先生
Yes, it is, Mr. Holmes.

471
00:37:06,086 --> 00:37:09,840
至少有20张50磅的钞票
At least twenty 50-pound notes,

472
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:13,387
用钱打发不走
a bribe that failed.

473
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:20,229
看来 开了两枪
So, two bullets fired,

474
00:37:20,313 --> 00:37:22,106
一死一伤 您所言不虚
two wounds inflicted, as you said.

475
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:23,318
是啊 大夫
Yes, Doctor.

476
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:24,652
那么你打算如何解释
Then how do you account for the bullet

477
00:37:24,777 --> 00:37:30,200
这颗明显击中了窗框的子弹?
that has so obviously struck the window frame?

478
00:37:31,661 --> 00:37:34,331
真想不到 你是怎么看到的?
By George, however did you see that?!

479
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:38,086
因为我来找了 卡休医生
Because, Dr. Carthew, I looked for it.

480
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,465
太厉害了 那子弹 怎么会 还在里头
Wonderful, why, the bullet's still there!

481
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,470
那么说一共是开了三枪了
So a third shot must have been fired.

482
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:47,681
也就是说 当时还有第三个人在场了
Which means that a third person must have been present.

483
00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:49,894
一点不假
Exactly!

484
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,479
你们昨晚进到这间屋子
When you came into this room last night,

485
00:37:51,604 --> 00:37:55,775
看到房门稍开 窗户也是开着的吗?
you say that the door was ajar; was not that window also open?

486
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,487
我不知道 先生 我想
I don't know, sir.

487
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:58,655
不是 先生
No, sir.

488
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,492
是关着的
It was shut.

489
00:38:00,575 --> 00:38:03,995
桑德斯 你们跟厨师去书房等着好吗
Saunders, will you and Cook wait in the library,

490
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,790
还有你 沃克
and you, Walker.

491
00:38:07,417 --> 00:38:12,381
卡休医生 你可以把尸体移走了
Dr. Carthew, you may remove the body.

492
00:38:20,142 --> 00:38:24,188
看来是丘比特夫人自己关的窗
It was Mrs. Cubitt herself who shut that window.

493
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:30,280
要是桑德斯跟厨师在楼上就闻到了硝烟味
If Saunders and the Cook smelled smoke and gunpowder upstairs,

494
00:38:30,407 --> 00:38:35,120
那肯定这儿的风不小
then there must have been a strong through draft.

495
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:36,913
不然的话 不会这么快
Otherwise, it would not have spread so quickly

496
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,208
就传到楼上去了
through the house.

497
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:41,753
我们知道那扇门是开着的
We know that door was open,

498
00:38:41,879 --> 00:38:43,839
那么那扇窗户 一定也是开着的
that window, too, must also have been open,

499
00:38:43,924 --> 00:38:45,718
不过只开了一会儿
but only for a short time.

500
00:38:45,801 --> 00:38:48,846
为什么说只开了一会儿?
Why only for a short time?

501
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,932
因为烛火还没融化边缘
Because the candles have not gutted.

502
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:54,562
不然会流下烛泪来的
There is no trail of wax.

503
00:38:54,687 --> 00:38:57,982
精彩 精彩
Wonderful, wonderful!

504
00:39:01,487 --> 00:39:02,947
要是丘比特先生生前
If the late Mr. Hilton Cubitt

505
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:07,871
开的那枪 射中了窗框
fired the bullet which pierced the window frame,

506
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,748
那他一定是冲着
he must have been aiming at

507
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:14,087
要么站在屋内的人
someone who was standing either inside

508
00:39:14,212 --> 00:39:15,923
要么就是个在窗外的人
or just outside the window.

509
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,468
谢谢 探长
Oh, thank you, Inspector.

510
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:19,762
那就是说 让丘比特先生送命的那颗子弹
Which means that the bullet which killed Mr. Cubitt

511
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:20,971
有可能是...
could have been fired by-

512
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:25,394
探长 我们真是英雄所见略同啊
Inspector, your thoughts and mine agree entirely.

513
00:39:47,508 --> 00:39:49,260
这就是那颗
This is the cartridge case

514
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:55,057
杀了希尔顿丘比特先生的子弹上的弹壳
of the bullet which killed Mr. Hilton Cubitt.

515
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:06,823
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

516
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,368
要是共开了三枪
if three shots were fired,

517
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:13,456
为什么金太太跟桑德斯只听到了两声枪响?
why did Mrs. King and Saunders only hear two shots?

518
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:17,629
她们说了实情 可惜没意识到这是谎话
They were telling the truth, but lied without realizing it.

519
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,718
我可有点听不明白了
I'm not sure that I follow you.

520
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:24,513
你还记得金太太说的
You remember what Mrs. King said,

521
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,354
"我被一声巨响惊醒了 只能用"
"I was awoken by this terrible bang, an explosion,

522
00:40:30,481 --> 00:40:31,190
"爆炸来形容"
it is the only word.

523
00:40:31,316 --> 00:40:32,233
"过了一分钟"
And then a minute later

524
00:40:32,358 --> 00:40:36,446
"又听到了一次较低的声响"
there was another bang but not so loud. "

525
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:43,204
第一次巨响其实是几乎同时射出的两枪
The first bang was two shots, fired almost simultaneously;

526
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:45,834
一枪从窗外射进来 杀了希尔顿丘比特
one from the window, which killed Hilton Cubitt,

527
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:47,210
另一枪是希尔顿丘比特打的
and one from Hilton Cubitt,

528
00:40:47,336 --> 00:40:50,339
射偏打中了窗框
which missed and went into the window frame.

529
00:40:52,092 --> 00:40:55,930
那第三枪?
And the third shot?

530
00:40:56,057 --> 00:41:01,854
哀莫过于此 丘比特夫人
The saddest of all, Mrs. Cubitt,

531
00:41:01,938 --> 00:41:05,691
绝望之下 欲饮弹自尽
self-administered in her despair.

532
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:14,496
你们谁知道这附近有一家旅馆
Now, do any of you know of an inn in the neighborhood

533
00:41:14,623 --> 00:41:18,752
叫艾尔里奇?
called Elrige's?

534
00:41:21,799 --> 00:41:25,594
有个农场主姓这个姓 离这儿几英里远
There's a farmer of that name, lives some miles off,

535
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:28,847
往...马尔布鲁克方向
in the direction of, uh, Milbrook.

536
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:30,601
偏僻的农场?
Is it a lonely farm?

537
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:32,687
非常偏 先生
Very lonely, sir.

538
00:41:32,812 --> 00:41:34,021
那会不会有可能
Then it is just possible

539
00:41:34,148 --> 00:41:35,608
昨晚这儿发生的一切
that the news of what happened here last night

540
00:41:35,733 --> 00:41:37,277
还没传到那儿去
has not reached them.

541
00:41:37,402 --> 00:41:39,153
说不定 先生
Maybe not, sir.

542
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,947
太棒了
Excellent!

543
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:43,785
沃克
Walker,

544
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,078
我想让你把这个便条
I want you to take this note

545
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:49,040
交给艾尔里奇农场的亚伯斯拉内
to a Mr. Abe Slaney of Elrige's Farm.

546
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,670
别说是我写的便条
Do not say that the note is from me,

547
00:41:51,795 --> 00:41:53,839
也不要提到昨晚这儿发生的事
and make no mention of what happened here last night.

548
00:41:53,966 --> 00:41:56,051
明白了吗?
Now, you understand?

549
00:41:56,176 --> 00:41:58,595
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

550
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,724
谢谢你 沃克
Thank you, Walker.

551
00:42:02,685 --> 00:42:10,236
我预料会有人被我的便条邀来的
I am expecting a visitor in answer to my note.

552
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:14,157
桑德斯 他会来见丘比特夫人
Now, Saunders, he will ask for Mrs. Cubitt.

553
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:17,203
我要你带他到这儿来
I want you to show him into this room.

554
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,873
还要这房子看上去一切正常
I want this house to look quite normal,

555
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,379
你对所发生之事务必只字不提
and you must not give anything away of what has happened.

556
00:42:24,465 --> 00:42:26,634
好的 先生
Very good, sir.

557
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,845
好了 我建议你们还是各司其职去吧
Now, I suggest you return to your duties.

558
00:42:29,928 --> 00:42:34,183
而卡休医生 我建议您去照看您的病人
And, Dr. Carthew, I suggest you return to your patient.

559
00:42:35,728 --> 00:42:38,856
对了 金太太
Oh, Mrs. King,

560
00:42:38,941 --> 00:42:43,071
您的女主人是无辜的
your mistress is quite innocent.

561
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:08,771
你是怎么解开密码的?
But how did you break the code?

562
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:10,984
你看看
Well, you see,

563
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:15,613
一切密文的破解之路
the rules which guide us in deciphering all secret writing

564
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,409
都在于字母E
depend on the fact that E,

565
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:23,248
E是英语中最常见的字母
E is the most common letter in the English language.

566
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,876
所以 可想而知 我们真走运
So, you see, we were very fortunate

567
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,380
因为丘比特夫人名叫艾尔西
that Mrs. Cubitt's name was Elsie,

568
00:43:28,465 --> 00:43:30,050
在第二张字条里颇为明显
and that it featured in the second message,

569
00:43:30,134 --> 00:43:36,600
这样不光破解了字母E 还破解了L S跟I
which gave us not only the E, but the L, the S and the I.

570
00:43:36,726 --> 00:43:39,103
而接下来的
Now, next, it seemed likely to us

571
00:43:39,186 --> 00:43:42,440
两张字条像是提到了
that two of the messages were appeals of some sort

572
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:44,986
丘比特先生
to Mrs. Cubitt...

573
00:43:59,506 --> 00:44:03,344
...加上T和G 字条写的就是:
...by adding the T and the G, the message reads:

574
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:09,141
"在艾尔里奇 过来 艾尔西"
"AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

575
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:12,980
要是这个亚伯斯拉内就是凶手
Well, if this Abe Slaney is indeed the murderer,

576
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:15,193
我们得立即行动逮捕他
we must make an immediate move to arrest him.

577
00:44:15,318 --> 00:44:16,361
不用慌张 探长
Calm yourself, Inspector.

578
00:44:16,486 --> 00:44:18,655
我想他随时都会来
I expect him here at any moment.

579
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,325
可斯拉内怎么会来这儿?
But why should Slaney come here?

580
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,452
因为我写信要他来
Because I have written and asked him.

581
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,704
可他不会起疑心吗?
But won't his suspicions be roused?

582
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,124
难道他不想逃跑吗?
Will he not try to escape?

583
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,209
桑德斯?
Saunders?

584
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:31,046
打扰了 先生 有位先生往这边来了
Excuse me, sir, there's a gentleman approaching the house.

585
00:44:33,175 --> 00:44:35,260
你觉得他带枪了吗?
Do you think he'd be armed?

586
00:44:35,386 --> 00:44:38,013
傻子才不带
He's a fool if he's not.

587
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:53,702
您好 先生
Good day, sir.

588
00:44:53,785 --> 00:44:55,328
丘比特夫人在吗?
Is Mrs. Cubitt at home?

589
00:44:55,412 --> 00:44:59,124
我会为您通报 先生 请您进来
I'll inquire, sir, if you'll step inside.

590
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:09,221
请问您尊姓大名?
What name shall I say?

591
00:45:09,348 --> 00:45:11,976
就说是个老朋友  她在等我
Tell her it's an old friend. She's expecting me.

592
00:45:12,101 --> 00:45:14,854
请您在书房稍等片刻
If you'll wait in the library a moment.

593
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:34,463
好吧 先生们 看来你们是占到上风了
Well, gentlemen, it looks like you've got the drop on me,

594
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:36,885
不过谁能告诉这是怎么回事?
but what the hell is going on?

595
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:39,094
我想你就是亚伯斯拉内
Abe Slaney, I believe.

596
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:40,721
是有怎么样 你又是哪根葱?
What if I am, and who are you, anyway?

597
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:42,058
我的名字并不重要
My name would mean nothing to you,

598
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:44,060
不过我想芝加哥警局的威尔逊哈格里夫
though I suspect that of Wilson Hargreave

599
00:45:44,143 --> 00:45:47,021
这个名字你该知道吧
of the Chicago Police Department, will.

600
00:45:48,024 --> 00:45:51,444
啊 看来的确知道
Ah, I see that it does.

601
00:45:54,282 --> 00:45:57,827
斯拉内先生 你该知道
Mr. Slaney, you should know

602
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:03,333
艾尔西丘比特伤势正重
that Mrs. Elsie Cubitt is very seriously ill.

603
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,462
鬼才信你
I don't believe you.

604
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:08,092
这话骗小孩差不多
This is some cheap trick.

605
00:46:08,217 --> 00:46:11,678
艾尔西丘比特夫人一小时前刚给我写了张字条
Mrs. Elsie Cubitt wrote me a note just an hour ago,

606
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:13,806
只有我才看得懂的字条
a note that only I can understand.

607
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:18,270
若想人不懂 除非己莫写
What one man can invent, another can discover:

608
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:25,824
"我来了 亚伯斯拉内 在艾尔里奇 来吧艾尔西"
"I'M HERE, ABE SLANEY. AT ELRIGE'S, COME ELSIE."

609
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,367
你最后一张字条是
And your last note to her:

610
00:46:27,492 --> 00:46:31,621
"艾尔西 准备见上帝吧"
"ELSIE PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD."

611
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,293
而这张
And this.

612
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:38,380
是你写的?
You wrote that note?

613
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:39,717
你说艾尔西受伤是骗我的
But you were lying about Elsie.

614
00:46:39,842 --> 00:46:42,970
斯拉内 你开枪打死希尔顿丘比特之后
Slaney, when you shot and killed Hilton Cubitt,

615
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:47,182
艾尔西丘比特 伤心欲绝 想一死了之
Elsie Cubitt, in her despair, attempted to kill herself,

616
00:46:47,268 --> 00:46:48,436
现在还很危险
and is now at death's door.

617
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:49,729
不
No.

618
00:46:49,856 --> 00:46:51,691
不 我要见她
No, I gotta see her!

619
00:46:51,774 --> 00:46:54,360
我得见她 我爱她 天地良心 艾尔西
I gotta see her, I love her, for God's sake, Elsie!

620
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:56,362
我爱你 艾尔西
I love you, Elsie!

621
00:46:56,448 --> 00:46:58,700
艾尔西 艾尔西
Elsie, Elsie!

622
00:46:58,825 --> 00:47:02,245
我相信她从美国远走高飞就是为了躲开你
I believe that she fled from America to avoid you.

623
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:04,789
而你尾随而来 让她经历了丧夫之痛
Because you followed her and made her life a misery,

624
00:47:04,916 --> 00:47:06,460
她还不得不面对
she now lies under grave suspicion

625
00:47:06,585 --> 00:47:08,920
谋杀亲夫的严重嫌疑
of murdering the husband she loved.

626
00:47:09,048 --> 00:47:13,635
至少你可以为她洗清罪名
The least you can do is to clear her of that.

627
00:47:16,265 --> 00:47:19,310
我想我目前能做到的就是
I guess the very best case I can make for myself now

628
00:47:19,435 --> 00:47:22,730
把赤裸裸的真相 告诉你们
is to tell you the absolute, naked truth.

629
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:24,025
我有责任警告你
It is my duty to warn you

630
00:47:24,108 --> 00:47:28,488
这会作为对你不利的证据
that it will be used against you.

631
00:47:28,615 --> 00:47:29,574
我想你也许知道
I guess you probably know

632
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,036
艾尔西的父亲是芝加哥最有势力的人
that Elsie's father's the most powerful man in Chicago.

633
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,749
是芝加哥最有势力的犯罪分子之一
One of the most powerful criminal men in Chicago.

634
00:47:37,876 --> 00:47:41,004
就是他发明的跳舞小人
It was he who invented the dancing men.

635
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:43,384
以前我们用来做暗号
We used it as a code in the old days.

636
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:45,302
艾尔西还是个孩子时 我就认识她
I've known Elsie since she was a child.

637
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:47,179
我和她订了婚
She was promised to me.

638
00:47:47,306 --> 00:47:48,349
我可能是威胁了她
I may have threatened her,

639
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:52,895
可我绝不会碰她一根头发的
but I wouldn't have touched a hair on her pretty head.

640
00:47:52,978 --> 00:47:57,608
不过你说的对 她痛恨芝加哥的一切
But you're right, she hated the whole Chicago business.

641
00:47:57,735 --> 00:48:00,780
所以她就跑到欧洲去了
That's why she ran away to Europe.

642
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:03,827
直到她嫁给了这个英国佬
It was only after her marriage to this Englishman

643
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:06,121
我才发现了她的行踪
that I was able to find out where she was.

644
00:48:06,248 --> 00:48:10,293
我写信给她 可没收到回信
I wrote to her, but I got no answer.

645
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:12,712
她把信烧了
She burned your letter.

646
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,761
她在达比郡这儿过得很开心
She was happy in her new life in Darbyshire.

647
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:22,141
我来英国是为了带她回家的
I came here to England to take her home!

648
00:48:22,226 --> 00:48:23,978
我给她留了言
I sent her notes.

649
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,522
为了哄艾尔西回家 我想尽办法
I did everything I could to coax Elsie away,

650
00:48:26,649 --> 00:48:31,195
结果丧失了理智 我开始威胁她
then my temper got the better of me and I began to threaten her.

651
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:35,034
不过昨天她给我写了回信
But yesterday she sent me a letter!

652
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,829
她说等到他丈夫睡去之后 会下楼来
She said she would come down when her husband was asleep

653
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:41,293
在书房尽头的窗户跟我谈谈
and speak to me through the end window

654
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:46,882
要是我就这么离开 让她静静地生活就好了
if I would go away afterwards and leave her in peace.

655
00:48:47,009 --> 00:48:53,642
难道你还不明白吗?
Can I make you see?

656
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:57,229
我从没像跟他在一起这样快乐过
I've never been so happy as I've been here with him.

657
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:59,442
我爱他
I love him.

658
00:49:01,861 --> 00:49:05,740
亚伯 我想留下 我要留下
Abe, I wanna stay, and I'm going to stay.

659
00:49:05,867 --> 00:49:08,161
那你芝加哥的朋友怎么办?
What about your friends in Chicago?

660
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:10,121
你的家人怎么办?
What about your family?!

661
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,750
你管他们叫朋友?
Friends do you call them;

662
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:15,879
一帮子凶手 劫匪 勒索犯 那算什么家?
killers, robbers, extortionists, some family.

663
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:18,217
可咱们两个订婚了
But you and I were engaged!

664
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,011
对不起 亚伯 那是父亲强迫我答应的
I'm sorry, Abe, my father forced me into it.

665
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:27,392
跟你过那种生活 要我怎么能开心?
How could I be happy with you in that life?!

666
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:33,109
请你离开吧 求你了 我求你了
Please go away, please, I beg you.

667
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:34,904
你求我?
You beg me?!

668
00:49:35,031 --> 00:49:36,950
是
Yes.

669
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,076
希尔顿这么好
Hilton is such a good man.

670
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:41,496
要是让他卷入丑闻 我会心碎的
It would break my heart if scandal ever touched him.

671
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:46,461
给你钱
Here's money,

672
00:49:46,586 --> 00:49:48,755
都在这儿了
it's all that I have.

673
00:49:48,882 --> 00:49:53,429
请你走吧
Now, please go away.

674
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:56,100
不
No!

675
00:49:56,225 --> 00:49:56,809
你要跟我回家
You're coming home!

676
00:49:56,934 --> 00:49:57,435
不
No!

677
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,102
你得跟我回去
You're coming home!

678
00:49:58,227 --> 00:49:58,853
不
No!

679
00:49:58,978 --> 00:50:00,938
真他...
What the-

680
00:50:07,031 --> 00:50:08,616
不
No!

681
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:28,470
我想我们听得够多了 走吧
I think we've heard enough for the moment, come along.

682
00:51:28,597 --> 00:51:30,558
走之前能让我看看她吗?
Can't I see her before I go?

683
00:51:30,683 --> 00:51:33,102
谁也不能去看她
Nobody can see her,

684
00:51:33,227 --> 00:51:37,606
连我们都没这权利
even we have not been given that privilege.

685
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,619
福尔摩斯先生
Mr. Holmes,

686
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:49,664
我希望要是我再碰上什么大案
I hope that if ever again I have an important case,

687
00:51:49,791 --> 00:51:53,587
还能交好运 有你帮助
I shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.

688
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:57,259
再会了 十分感谢
Good afternoon, and thank you.

689
00:52:01,056 --> 00:52:02,141
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

690
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:06,562
你那字条写的是什么?
What did you write in that note?

691
00:52:07,982 --> 00:52:09,942
看看你懂吗?
See if you could read it.

692
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:24,127
"立-刻-赶-来"
"COME-HERE-AT-ONCE,"

693
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:27,297
"立刻赶来"
"COME HERE AT ONCE."

694
00:52:27,382 --> 00:52:31,428
这也太简单了点
How absurdly simple.

695
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:33,933
就这样 跳舞的小人们
And so the dancing men,

696
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:36,143
在为恶多年后
which had so often been the agents of evil,

697
00:52:36,268 --> 00:52:39,230
终于站到了正义的一边
were finally used on the side of justice.

698
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:42,360
亚伯斯拉内在达比法庭被判死刑
Abe Slaney was condemned to death at the Darby assizes,

699
00:52:42,485 --> 00:52:44,654
但他被改判为终身监禁
but his sentence was changed to penal servitude

700
00:52:44,781 --> 00:52:47,826
因为有特殊情形
in consideration of mitigating circumstances

701
00:52:47,951 --> 00:52:53,373
是希尔顿丘比特先生先开的枪
in the certainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot.

702
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,961
丘比特夫人彻底恢复了健康
Mrs. Cubitt made a complete recovery,

703
00:52:56,044 --> 00:53:00,966
一直住在瑞都岭镇庄园
and lives still at Ridling Thorpe Manor.

704
