1
00:00:04,384 --> 00:00:06,284
我去商店里买点东西
I'm just gonna run to the store and get a few things.

2
00:00:06,284 --> 00:00:07,334
等你剪完再来接你
I'll pick you up when you're done.

3
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:08,134
好
Okay.

4
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,674
我比较喜欢你在这儿陪我  不过没关系
I like it a little better when you stay, but all right.

5
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:12,644
嗨  谢尔顿
Hey, Sheldon.

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,724
嗨  我来找诺费奥先生为我理发
Hello. I'm here for my haircut with Mr. D'Onofrio.

7
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:17,964
真抱歉  托尼舅舅还在医院呢
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony's in the hospital.

8
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:19,184
他病得很厉害
He's pretty sick.

9
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:22,484
天啊  诺费奥先生在医院
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's in the hospital.

10
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,094
我的命运为何如此多舛
Why do these things always happen to me?

11
00:00:26,054 --> 00:00:27,514
我可以帮你理发
I can cut it for you.

12
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,354
你不是诺费奥先生
You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

13
00:00:30,124 --> 00:00:32,324
我的头发一般是诺费奥先生理的
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

14
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,234
你信得过这家伙吗
You believe this guy?

15
00:00:35,274 --> 00:00:36,704
先失陪一下
Excuse us for a second.

16
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,474
谢尔顿  没关系  他能行的
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.

17
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:39,334
他也是个理发师
He's a barber.

18
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:42,194
他不是理发师  他是理发师的外甥
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

19
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,364
他就是理发界日益猖獗的
He's an example of the kind of nepotism

20
00:00:44,364 --> 00:00:47,134
裙带关系的典型范例
that runs rampant in the barbering industry.

21
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:50,664
另外  诺费奥先生很清楚我喜欢什么样的发型
Besides, Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done

22
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:54,304
因为他有我在德州理发时的理发记录
because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas.

23
00:00:55,374 --> 00:00:56,664
你在瞎扯什么啊
What are you talking about?

24
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:58,194
我刚搬来这里的时候
When I first moved here,

25
00:00:58,194 --> 00:01:00,044
找新理发师这事儿很让我发愁
I was nervous about finding a new barber,

26
00:01:00,044 --> 00:01:02,324
所以我妈就把我的理发记录
so my mother had all my haircut records

27
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:04,214
都寄给了诺费奥先生
sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

28
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,924
根本没有理发记录这回事
There's no such thing as haircut records.

29
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:10,544
不  肯定有的
Yes, there are.

30
00:01:11,574 --> 00:01:12,744
你见过你的理发记录吗
Have you ever seen them?

31
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:15,164
没  不过我妈妈保证肯定寄过来了
No, but my mother assured me they were sent here,

32
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:17,074
我敢跟你打包票
and I'll bet you dollars to donuts

33
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,574
这家伙肯定没我的理发记录
that this one doesn't have them.

34
00:01:19,284 --> 00:01:20,164
打扰一下
Uh, excuse me.

35
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:23,014
你能拿到我的理发记录吗
Do you have access to my haircut records?

36
00:01:23,014 --> 00:01:24,204
你的什么
Your what?

37
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,644
托马斯・斯特恩斯・艾略特
著名美国诗人  诺贝尔文学奖得主

38
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:26,644
用T・S・艾略特的诗来说
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,

39
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:30,484
这句改自他的作品《空心人》  原文为
"世界就是这样告终的  不是砰的一声而是一声抽泣"

40
00:01:26,644 --> 00:01:28,124
世界就是这样告终的
this is the way the world ends--

41
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:30,484
不是砰的一声而是一个外甥
not with a bang but with a nephew.

42
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,234
谢尔顿  你都是个大人了  他也是专业人士
Sheldon, you're a grown man, he's a professional,

43
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:39,334
而且你的发型是1946年那张海报上的第三个
and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946.

44
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:40,704
赶紧坐下
Just sit down

45
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:41,934
让他给你剪吧
and let him do it.

46
00:01:41,934 --> 00:01:44,434
好吧  如果我剪完看起来个傻蛋
Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork,

47
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,494
那就全赖你
it's on you.

48
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:56,194
我家小孩今天讲了件特别有意思的事
So my kid said the funniest thing today.

49
00:01:56,214 --> 00:01:57,144
算了
Nope.

50
00:02:02,284 --> 00:02:03,714
如果你日后跟别人说这事
When you tell this story later,

51
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:06,434
记得用"古怪"这个词来形容
the word we usually use is "quirky."

52

生活大爆炸  第五季第十八集

61
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,139
你能把帕马森干酪递给我吗
Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?

62
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:34,619
好
Sure.

63
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,189
你这是干嘛
What are you doing?

64
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:46,999
把我的头发从眼前吹开
I'm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.

65
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:51,139
谢尔顿  你就是晚了一天没理发而已
Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut.

66
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,699
谢谢你  一句话点明了我的恶梦
Thank you for captioning my nightmare.

67
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:58,049
瞧  我收到我的随行指示信了
Lookie here, I got my travel orders.

68
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,209
"随行专家霍华德・沃罗威茨受命
"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested

69
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,639
前往位于德州休斯顿的国家宇航局
to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center,

70
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,639
约翰逊太空中心
Houston, Texas,

71
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,979
于周日早上八点接受宇航员特训"
for astronaut training Monday 8:00 a.m."

72
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,049
不过这是宇航局的信  所以时间得按照军事格式来念
Yeah, but it's from NASA, so it's 0800.

73
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:12,549
可上面写的是"早上八点"
But it says "8:00 a.m."

74
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:16,449
你得按照军事格式来念"0800"
You read it as "0800."

75
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:18,039
可它前面没写有"O"啊
It doesn't have an "O" in front of it.

76
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,309
你知道哪句话前面有"O[哦]"吗
You know what does have an "oh" in front of it?

77
00:03:21,309 --> 00:03:22,619
"哦  我的天  我现在是宇航员了"
"Oh, my God, I'm an astronaut,

78
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,969
"你就羡慕嫉妒恨吧"
and you're dying of jealousy."

79
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:27,229
那他们要...
So, what kind of things are they...?

80
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:28,779
你能消停会儿吗
Will you stop that?

81
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:34,399
我忍不住  感觉自己就像是个少女杀手
I can't help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob.

82
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,889
谢尔顿  我以前常给我哥剪头发
You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.

83
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:38,959
我也能帮你的
I could do it for you.

84
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,849
佩妮  我知道这是你的一片好心
Penny, I know you mean well,

85
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:44,889
用你们村里的手艺来帮我  不过呢
offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um,

86
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:46,979
在我们城里
here in town,

87
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,539
我们不用搅乳器来搅黄油
we don't churn our own butter,

88
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,679
我们也不用麻袋来做裙子
we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks,

89
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:53,019
我们也很确定不想让一个染黄发的丫头
and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut

90
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,019
来给自己理发
by bottle-blonde...

91
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,679
谢尔顿  为人要友善
Sheldon, be nice.

92
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,699
不好意思  有个坏小子的发型
I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude

93
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,119
就有个坏小子的脾气
that comes with this hair.

94
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:04,769
你可以试试我的理发师
You could go to my guy.

95
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:06,749
他在比弗利山庄[富人区]的著名美发沙龙
He's at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills.

96
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,929
他们会给你沏茶  会给你按摩头皮
They bring you a cup of tea, they'll massage your scalp.

97
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:11,799
虽然要两百块  不过没准有时坐在你旁边的
It's about $200, but sometimes you look in the next chair

98
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:14,929
就是一位超级巨星  比如托尼・丹扎
and you see a superstar like Tony Danza.

99
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,609
快速提问
Quick question here:

100
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,369
我们真的已经把话题
Have we actually changed the conversation

101
00:04:19,369 --> 00:04:20,939
从"我要去参加宇航员特训"
from "I'm going to astronaut training"

102
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:23,009
转到"谢尔顿找不到地方理发"了吗
to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

103
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,089
你看现在是谁在羡慕嫉妒恨
Now who's dying of jealousy?

104
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:27,039
"哦"  是你啊
"Oh," it's you.

105
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,529
我是牛仔 *
* I'm a cowboy

106
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,529
邦・乔维的《亡命天涯》

107
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:36,699
骑着一匹铁马 *
* On a steel horse I ride

108
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,539
我想要 *
* I'm wanted

109
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:43,169
我想要 *
* I'm wanted

110
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,579
想要 *
* Wanted

111
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,359
亡命天涯 *
* Dead or alive

112
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:51,209
谢尔顿
Sheldon,

113
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,199
你把我们的情侣对唱之夜都给毁了
you're ruining girlfriend- boyfriend sing-along night.

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:55,589
抱歉
I'm sorry.

115
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:58,659
我在找理发店  我的时间不多了
I'm looking for a barber and I'm running out of time.

116
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:02,929
1飞秒等于10的-15次方秒
1幺米等于10的-24次方米

117
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,839
我的头发正以每飞秒
My hair is growing at the rate

118
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,929
4.6幺米的速度生长着
of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond.

119
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:06,759
你要是安静点  还能听见头发生长的声音
I mean, if you're quiet, you can hear it.

120
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:10,459
要不去"超级剪"美发沙龙呢
What about Supercuts?

121
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,479
我去过一次
I tried once.

122
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,799
那里无论男人还是女人
They do men's and women's hair

123
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,789
都坐在同一个房间里一块剪
in the same room at the same time.

124
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,359
那简直就像是带有摩丝的罪恶之城
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.

125
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,639
这件事没那么严重
Well, this isn't a crisis.

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,069
何不干脆让头发长长点算了
Why don't you just let your hair grow out a little?

127
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,069
何不干脆让头发长长
Why don't I let my hair grow out?

128
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,739
那我何不干脆开始穿凉鞋
Um, why don't I start wearing Birkenstocks

129
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:30,839
并用"你喜欢不"这句话
and seeking validation of my opinions by asking

130
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,449
来求证我的选择
"Can you dig it?"

131
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,899
我不知道啊
Well, I don't know.

132
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,349
我是觉得你留长头发挺性感的
I think you might look sexy with long hair.

133
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:41,119
就留那种齐肩长发
The kind that flows down to your shoulders

134
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,399
骑马的时候还能随风飘动
and blows back while riding on a horse.

135
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,239
马背光溜溜  你胸光溜溜
Bareback and bare-chested.

136
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,459
brush my teeth  可用来指代"自慰"

137
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,459
我要去"刷牙"了  估计得刷一会儿
I'm gonna go brush my teeth; it might take a while.

138
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,039
宝贝儿
Hi, sweetie.

139
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:02,989
我想你
I miss you.

140
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:04,689
我也想你了
I miss you, too.

141
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:07,159
你第一天过得怎么样
So tell me all about your first day.

142
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,729
我该从哪讲起呢
Oh, wow, where do I even start?

143
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,029
我体验了零重力
I got to experience zero gravity.

144
00:06:13,029 --> 00:06:14,649
酷  他们怎么做到的
Cool. How do they do that?

145
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:15,469
还挺简单的
It's pretty neat.

146
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:16,669
你坐进飞机
You get in this plane

147
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:20,609
然后垂直上升  历时大概二十秒左右
that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds,

148
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:25,279
然后再跟要坠机一样  垂直下落
and then straight back down like it's going to crash, and

149
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:28,669
如此循环往复
they do it over and over again, you know,

150
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,569
吐到连胆汁都快出来了也没人管
no matter how many times you throw up.

151
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,489
你吐了吗
You threw up?

152
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,749
是啊  而且最变态的是
Yeah...and the craziest part is,

153
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,299
因为是零重力环境
because there's no gravity,

154
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:39,299
呕吐物就浮在空中
the throw-up kind of floats there...

155
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:42,599
呈一个球状
in a little ball,

156
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,899
如果你吓得大叫
and if your mouth is open

157
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,849
嘴巴张开的话
because you're screaming...

158
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,809
有时呕吐物就会再飘回你嘴里
...sometimes it just floats right back in.

159
00:06:55,029 --> 00:06:57,479
天啊  到时候你就沦为大家的笑柄
Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens.

160
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,239
他们听起来好坏哦
That sounds mean.

161
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,399
没有
No.

162
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,009
其实我当时也想笑的
Yeah, I would have laughed, too,

163
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:04,229
只不过我不想让呕吐物二次飘回我的嘴里
but I didn't want the vomit to come back out.

164
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:08,339
总而言之
Anyway...

165
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,069
对了  你能不能帮我
Oh, could you do me a favor

166
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,179
连夜快递几条内裤过来
and overnight me some more underwear?

167
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:15,359
没问题  怎么了
Sure, why?

168
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,009
今天看了一眼那台离心机
I got a look at the centrifuge

169
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,659
明天我要在里面进行高速旋转训练
they're going to spin me around in tomorrow,

170
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:21,479
于是我隐约感觉到我带的内裤不够
and I have a hunch I packed a little light.

171
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,669
诺费奥先生
Mr. D'Onofrio?

172
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:33,389
是我  谢尔顿
It's me, Sheldon.

173
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:38,259
礼品店里没有任何和理发相关的礼物
They didn't have anything barber-themed in the gift shop,

174
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,159
所以我给你买了这个
so I got you this.

175
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,149
不知道您能不能看见他T恤上的小字
I don't know if you can read his little T-shirt.

176
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:45,259
上面写着  快点"熊"起来哦
It says, um, "Get well bear-y soon."

177
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:48,959
相信我  如果现在您稍微有点意识
Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now,

178
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,199
肯定也会发笑的
you'd be laughing.

179
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,779
总而言之
Anyway...

180
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,209
有一项新的研究表明  昏迷中的人
There's new studies that show, people in comas

181
00:08:00,209 --> 00:08:03,029
也能感知到身边发生的一切
are aware of everything going on around them.

182
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,119
所以说  如果您现在能听到我说话
With that in mind, if you can hear me,

183
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,069
请离开您的病床
move away from the light

184
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,089
跟着这把剪刀的声音走
and toward the sound of these scissors.

185
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,649
有什么可以帮到你吗
Can I help you?

186
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,049
是的
Yes.

187
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:18,689
你这里有类似理发店大围布的东西吗
Do you have something I could use as a cape?

188
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,719
天啊  你是不是把药给吐了
Oh, dear, did we spit out our pills,

189
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,929
然后从九楼[精神病科]偷溜出来
slip out of the ninth floor,

190
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,849
跑到这探险来了
and go on a little adventure?

191
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,509
不  不
Oh, no, no,

192
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,019
我只是来找他理发的
I'm just here to get my hair cut.

193
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,069
我明白了
I-I see.

194
00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:38,359
你在这等一下
J-Jus-Just wait here one moment.

195
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,269
保安
Security!

196
00:08:41,749 --> 00:08:43,219
我得跑了
I got to run.

197
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:46,539
但是不能拿着剪刀  那样太不安全了
But not with scissors -- that would be unsafe.

198
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:56,127
要是我把我的小马挪到这来
So, if I move my horsey here...

199
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,967
是不是就将军了  我是赢了吧
...isn't that checkmate and I win?

200
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,397
到底是不是我赢了
Well, is it or isn't it?

201
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,877
我们今天就下到这吧
You know, I think this is a good stopping point.

202
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:20,137
你第一次下象棋
Uh, it's your first real game.

203
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:21,897
有太多知识要消化了
I threw a lot of information at you.

204
00:09:21,897 --> 00:09:23,197
不
Well, no,

205
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:24,597
你的国王被我困住了
I mean, your king is trapped.

206
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:27,167
他不能往这走  因为我在这摆了个灯塔[车]
He can't go here because of my lighthouse,

207
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:28,347
还有
and...

208
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:33,537
他也不能往这走  因为我在这摆了一个尖头小人[象]
he can't go here because of my pointy-head guy.

209
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,407
正如我说的  这个游戏很复杂
Like I said, complicated game.

210
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,127
那我到底赢没赢
So did I win or not?

211
00:09:40,127 --> 00:09:41,337
你玩得开心吗
Did you have fun?

212
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:43,307
因为只要你玩得开心了  就算是赢了
Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner.

213
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:45,387
象棋就是这样
That's, that-that's what chess is all about.

214
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:50,937
-抱歉  谢尔顿  我这就挪开  -何必呢
- Sorry, Sheldon, I'll move.  - Eh, why?

215
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:54,077
我的位置  你的位置  有区别吗
My spot, your spot-- what difference does it make?

216
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,447
好吧  刚刚发生了什么
Okay, what just happened?

217
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:01,917
我不知道
I don't know.

218
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,217
一会是你的象棋技术堪比世界冠军
Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer

219
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,967
一会是谢尔顿不介意你坐了他的位置
and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot,

220
00:10:06,967 --> 00:10:09,507
我估计是有人穿越回去  踩死了只虫子[蝴蝶效应]
I'm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug,

221
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:11,697
改变了人类的历史进程吧
and changed the course of human events.

222
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:15,107
亲爱的  你没事吧
Uh, sweetie, are you all right?

223
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,477
不  我有事
No, I'm not all right.

224
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:20,637
我本来六天前就该剪头发了
It's been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut

225
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,697
除此之外  无大事发生
and nothing horrible has happened.

226
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,927
不好意思  我不懂
Okay, I'm sorry, I don't understand.

227
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:27,837
莱纳德  给她解释下
Leonard, explain it to her.

228
00:10:27,837 --> 00:10:30,027
那个  他疯了
Oh, uh, he's crazy.

229
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:34,077
我用了一生时间
I have spent my whole life

230
00:10:34,077 --> 00:10:35,737
精心安排我每天该做什么
trying to bring order to the universe

231
00:10:35,737 --> 00:10:38,537
就是想要给这个世界带来秩序
by carefully planning every moment of every day.

232
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,787
而我所有的努力
But all my efforts--

233
00:10:39,787 --> 00:10:42,407
我的晚餐安排  我的睡衣轮换制
our dinner schedule, my pajama rotation,

234
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,247
我的排便情况试算表
my bowel movement spreadsheet--

235
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:47,147
现在我算明白了
it's clear now,

236
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,577
我一直在浪费时间
I've been wasting my time.

237
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,027
很好  我要把那恶心的表格从冰箱上拿下来
Good. I'm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.

238
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,767
听我说  谢尔顿
You know, Sh-Sheldon,

239
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,837
有时未来不可预知也挺好的
sometimes it's nice not knowing what's coming.

240
00:10:57,837 --> 00:10:58,997
我是说  看我和莱纳德
I mean, look at me and Leonard.

241
00:10:58,997 --> 00:11:01,027
我们约会  分手  现在又试着复合
We went out, we broke up, now we're trying again.

242
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,307
我们也不知道未来会怎么样
We don't know what's gonna happen.

243
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,867
得了吧  你们会怎么样大家都心知肚明
Oh, please, everyone knows what's going to happen.

244
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,127
但我懂你们的意思
But I see your point.

245
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,577
我觉得这样对你挺好
I think this could be good for you.

246
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:13,187
也许你是该有所改变了
Maybe it's time for you to shake things up a bit.

247
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,367
你说的没错
You're right.

248
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,927
我应该接受无序的世界
I should embrace the chaos.

249
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:19,627
很好
Great.

250
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:20,837
那你先要做什么
What are you going to do first?

251
00:11:20,837 --> 00:11:21,957
我不知道
I don't know.

252
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,487
我什么都可以做
I could do anything.

253
00:11:23,487 --> 00:11:25,117
原来的规则通通丢掉
All bets are off.

254
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,777
出自莎士比亚

255
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:27,777
世界由我主宰
The world is my oyster.

256
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:30,597
我知道了
I got it.

257
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,787
我今晚要穿我星期二的睡衣
I'm going to put on my Tuesday pajamas tonight.

258
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:39,977
我得说  我有点担心他
I got to tell you, I'm a little worried about him.

259
00:11:40,197 --> 00:11:42,547
如果我是你  我会更担心刚有一个
If I were you, I'd be worried that a girl

260
00:11:42,547 --> 00:11:45,387
从没下过象棋的女生  让你输得落花流水这个事实
who's never played chess in her life just kicked your ass.

261
00:12:01,217 --> 00:12:03,397
华仔  你怎么了
Howie, what happened to you?

262
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:07,277
我们通宵在野外进行生存训练
We did overnight survival training in the wilderness.

263
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,277
好玩
Big fun.

264
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,067
超级好玩
Big, big fun.

265
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,547
我本想在跟你视频之前洗把脸
I was gonna freshen up for you

266
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:18,417
但我在去洗手间的路上  晕过去了一小会儿
but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom.

267
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:20,897
生存训练
Survival training?

268
00:12:20,897 --> 00:12:22,057
就像露营那样吗
Is that like camping?

269
00:12:22,057 --> 00:12:23,097
对啊
Uh-huh.

270
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:26,527
除了没有食物和水
Except you don't have food or water,

271
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:29,857
也不像汉斯・克拉默营那样的
and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service

272
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:32,137
日出而作  日落而息
like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer.

273
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,967
你是在帐篷里睡吗
Do you sleep in tents?

274
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,087
不是
No.

275
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:38,247
我睡在一个洞里
I slept in a hole

276
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:42,547
还是我徒手挖的洞
I dug in the ground with my bare hands.

277
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:46,277
而且晚上的时候
And at some point during the night,

278
00:12:46,277 --> 00:12:48,857
一只穿山甲爬了进来
an armadillo crawled in

279
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,357
还给了我爱的抱抱
and spooned me.

280
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,197
可怜的孩子
Poor baby.

281
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,287
但我做到了
But I did it.

282
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,737
我活下来了
I survived.

283
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,657
我不知道沙尘暴来时该往哪儿躲
I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit.

284
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,947
我只能拉起高领毛衣盖着头
I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head

285
00:13:06,947 --> 00:13:09,687
呆那儿等死
and waited for death.

286
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,747
但当我坐在那的时候
But somehow as I sat there,

287
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:18,417
裹在满是汗味的衣茧里
wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat,

288
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:23,647
我发现了人类精神的真谛
I found that primal part of the human spirit

289
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:27,647
就是要活下去
that just wants to keep on living,

290
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:29,817
无论付出什么代价
no matter what the cost.

291
00:13:30,587 --> 00:13:31,657
你太勇敢了
You're so brave.

292
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:32,997
我为你自豪
I'm proud of you.

293
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:35,597
我吃了只蝴蝶
I ate a butterfly.

294
00:13:43,277 --> 00:13:45,067
那只蝴蝶好小
It was so small

295
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,537
也很美
and...  beautiful,

296
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,877
但我好饿
but I was so hungry.

297
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,007
你在哭吗
Are you crying?

298
00:13:57,007 --> 00:13:59,907
不  我觉得这不可能
No, I don't think it's possible.

299
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:02,407
我已经严重脱水了
I'm severely dehydrated.

300
00:14:03,957 --> 00:14:05,967
我的尿就跟牙膏一样稠

华仔  如果你坚持不住  就回家吧

我对你的感觉不会变的

谢了  亲爱的  但我不能放弃

不然的话  我就是一个

有机会成为宇航员  却中途放弃的人

那我能为你做什么吗
Well, is there anything I could do to help?

307
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,797
没有
No.

308
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:31,167
等等  再多寄点内裤来
Wait. Send more underwear.

309
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:45,787
千万别是谢尔顿在打小手鼓
Don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.

310
00:14:50,137 --> 00:14:53,607
拜托千万别是谢尔顿在打小手鼓
Please don't let this be Sheldon playing bongos.

311
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:04,747
莱纳德呀  你喜欢我的小手鼓吗
Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos?

312
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:09,197
但我想呀  你没猜到我有小手鼓吧
Bet you didn't know that I had bongos.

谢尔顿  现在是凌晨三点
Sheldon, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning.

314

凌晨三点呀
3:00 in the morning

315
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,427
正适合弹小手鼓呀
is a good time for bongos.

316
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,207
我刚在睡觉
I was sleeping!

317
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:22,547
莱纳德在睡觉  而我在打小手鼓
Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.

318
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,317
不  他被吵醒了
No, he doesn't.

319
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:28,777
莱纳德被吵醒了  而我在打小手鼓
Leonard no sleep while I play bongos.

320
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,087
小手鼓独奏
Bongo solo.

321
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:36,617
停  住手
Stop! Stop it!

322
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,617
住手  别敲了
Stop! Stop! Stop it!

323
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:45,857
他妈的怎么回事啊
What the hell?!

324
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:46,837
佩妮  你猜怎么着
Penny, guess what?

325
00:15:46,837 --> 00:15:48,877
谢尔顿有对小手鼓
Sheldon got bongos.

326
00:15:49,527 --> 00:15:50,837
为什么你会有小手鼓
Why did you get bongos?

327
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:52,527
理查德・费曼会打小手鼓
Richard Feynman played the bongos.

328
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:54,117
我就想说我也该试试
I thought I'd give that a try.

329
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:56,047
理查德・费曼是位著名物理学家

330
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,277
莱纳德  现在是凌晨三点
Oh, Leonard, it's 3:00 o'clock in the morning.

331
00:15:57,277 --> 00:15:58,377
我才不管理查德・费曼
I don't care if Richard Feynman

332
00:15:58,377 --> 00:16:00,717
是不是我屁股里住着的紫色妖精呢
was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt.

333
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:05,777
佩妮是假设费曼是紫色妖精
Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun.

334
00:16:05,777 --> 00:16:08,977
佩妮忘记要用虚拟语气了
Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.

335
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,007
谢尔顿  睡觉去
Sheldon, go to bed.

336
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,567
你明早还有工作要做
You have work in the morning.

337
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,027
或许有  或许无

00:16:15,027 --> 00:16:17,917
或许明天我组个小手鼓乐队巡回演出去了
Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world.

339
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,197
不不  你等等

340
00:16:22,197 --> 00:16:23,407

00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:28,317
伴唱或男声四重唱
or barbershop quartets after ten p.m.

343
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:30,767
《室友协议》
Roommate Agreement?

344
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:31,867
你开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

345
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:34,237
我们生活在一个无序的世界
We are living in a world of chaos.

346
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,807
管他狗屁《室友协议》呢
Roommate Agreement.

347
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:40,067
你去哪
Where are you going?

348
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:42,127
我要跟着音乐走  喵喵
Wherever the music takes me, kitten.

349
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:48,997
我打着小手鼓呀  下着小楼梯呀
I play bongos walking down the stairs.

350
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,257
千万不要  边打小手鼓边下楼梯
Never play bongos walking down the stairs.

351
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,887
给你个惊喜
Surprise.

352
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,797
你在这干嘛
What are you doing here?

353
00:17:06,797 --> 00:17:08,517
我是来助你度过难关的
I'm here to help you get through this.

354
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,617
你自己做不来的
You can't do it on your own,

355
00:17:09,617 --> 00:17:11,327
你需要有人来照顾你
you need someone to take care of you.

356
00:17:12,177 --> 00:17:13,467
我太爱你了
Oh, I love you so much.

357
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,847
我也爱你

358
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:18,387
霍华德  洗澡水快凉了
Howard, your bath is getting cold!

359
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,397
别担心  一旦她睡着
Don't worry, once she falls asleep,

360
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:24,747
我会像穿山甲一样给你爱的抱抱
I'll spoon you like an armadillo.

361
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:32,497
昨晚半夜他带着小手鼓出现
He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos.

362
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:36,507
我错误以为这是某种音乐求欢方式
I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.

363
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:40,467
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

364
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,287
他一定精疲力竭了
He must have been exhausted.

365
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,897
谢尔顿想睡着呀  而莱纳德在打小手鼓呀
Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!

366
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:50,817
你这样有点过分吧
That was kind of uncalled for.

367
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,287
不  一点也不过分
No, it was called for.

368
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:54,787
怎么回事
What's going on?

369
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:55,657
好了  谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon,

370
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,477
你也该闹够了
this craziness has gone on long enough.

371
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:59,657
拜托回家去  让我给你理发吧
Please come home so I can cut your hair.

372
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:02,077
佩妮  你没受过培训
Penny, you're not trained.

373
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:03,347
你也没有执照
You're not licensed.

374
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:06,987
更重要的是  你拿不到我的理发记录
Most importantly, you don't have access to my haircut records.

375
00:18:10,187 --> 00:18:11,937
好了  宝贝
All right, honey, look,

376
00:18:11,937 --> 00:18:14,947
我们认识很久了  对吧
we've known each other for a long time now, right?

377
00:18:14,947 --> 00:18:17,367
我曾带你去过迪斯尼乐园
I've taken you to Disneyland,

378
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,507
我帮你踢过欺负你的恶霸的关键部位
I kicked a bully in the nuts for you,

379
00:18:20,357 --> 00:18:22,617
你病了我就给你唱《软猫猫》
I sing you "Soft Kitty" when you're sick,

380
00:18:23,157 --> 00:18:24,567
甚至你有次还见过我的裸体
you've even saw me naked once.

381
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,407
抱歉  你说什么
I'm sorry, what?

382
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:29,717
说来话长
It was a long story.

383
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,037
谢尔顿  我发誓我不会乱来
Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what I'm doing.

384
00:18:32,037 --> 00:18:33,827
求你让我帮你理发吧
Please let me cut your hair.

385
00:18:34,437 --> 00:18:37,087
艾米  你认为呢
Amy, what do you think?

386
00:18:37,927 --> 00:18:40,917
我愿意让她帮我修剪我身上的任何一处毛发
There's not a hair on my body I wouldn't let this woman trim.

387
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:51,477
好吧  走吧
Fine, let's go.

388
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,667
谢谢你让我睡在你的沙发上
Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch.

389
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,357
很少有女人会一直追着男人问
There's only so many times a woman can say,

390
00:18:58,357 --> 00:18:59,707
"睡我床上好不好"
"How about the bed?"

391
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,467
谢尔顿怎么会见过你的裸体呢
What's this about Sheldon seeing you naked?

392
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:08,927
放心吧  我只看到过她的屁股和乳房
Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts.

393
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:18,467
差不多了
Almost done.

394
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,727
每次理完发
At the end of the haircut,

395
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,547
诺费奥先生都会给我讲个黄色笑话
Mr. D'Onofrio would tell me a dirty joke.

396
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,237
抱歉  我不会说什么黄色笑话
Sorry, I don't know any dirty jokes.

397
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,367
没事  反正我也从来没听懂过
That's okay, I never understood them anyway.

398
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:34,707
好了  觉得如何
Okay, what do you think?

399
00:19:40,297 --> 00:19:42,037
有点好莱坞的感觉
it's a little Hollywood.

400
00:19:44,137 --> 00:19:46,417
不过我觉得我会看习惯的
But I think I can pull it off.

401
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,417
理得不错  佩妮
Well done, Penny.

402
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,617
早告诉你啦
Ha, told you.

403
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:50,517
只需理一下脖子这块的头发
Okay, I'm just gonna clean up your neck a little

404
00:19:50,527 --> 00:19:52,377
-你就可以走了  -好玩
- and then you are good to go. - Fun time.

405
00:19:54,107 --> 00:19:57,347
抱歉  有时这剃刀弄得我好痒痒
Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me.

406
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:58,567
好吧
Okay.

407
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:08,677
好了  大功告成
Okay, yep, we're all done now.

408
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:09,677
只是...挺好的
It's just... it's good.

409
00:20:09,677 --> 00:20:11,207
让我帮你把这块布拿下来
Let me just take that away from you.

410
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,877
-好了  -非常感谢
- Okay. - Thank you very much.

411
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:15,057
不客气
You are welcome.

412
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,027
看来我非搬不可了
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move.
