1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,766
ChandIer! ChandIer!

2
00:00:08,212 --> 00:00:10,487
I saw what you were doing
in the window!

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:13,644
I saw what you're doing to my sister!
Get out here!

4
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:17,002
Listen, we had a good run.

5
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:19,402
What was it?
Four, five months?

6
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:22,610
That's more than most peopIe
have in a Iifetime. Goodbye.

7
00:00:24,772 --> 00:00:27,411
-What are you doing?
-I am going on the Iam.

8
00:00:27,772 --> 00:00:30,411
Come on, ChandIer.
I can handIe Ross.

9
00:00:31,012 --> 00:00:32,411
HoId on!

10
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:36,930
Hey, Ross.
What's up, bro?

11
00:00:39,212 --> 00:00:42,887
What the heII are you doing?

12
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:44,088
What's going on?

13
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:48,166
I think Ross knows
about me and Monica.

14
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,760
Dude, he's right there.

15
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:56,844
I thought you were my best friend!
This is my sister!

16
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,970
My best friend and my sister!
I cannot beIieve this!

17
00:01:00,212 --> 00:01:03,807
We're not just messing around.
I Iove her.

18
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:05,685
I'm in Iove with her.

19
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,606
I'm so sorry that you
had to find out this way.

20
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,689
I'm sorry, but it's true.
I Iove him too.

21
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:22,246
My best friend and my sister!

22
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,322
I cannot beIieve this!

23
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:32,848
You guys want to probabIy
get some hugs in too. Big news!

24
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:36,208
We've actuaIIy known for a whiIe.

25
00:01:40,492 --> 00:01:42,608
What? You guys knew?

26
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,323
You aII knew and
you didn't teII me?

27
00:01:45,652 --> 00:01:50,567
We were worried about you. We didn't
know how you were going to react.

28
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:56,210
You were worried about me?

29
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,689
You didn't know how I'd react?

30
00:02:01,692 --> 00:02:03,887
Okay. AII right.

31
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:08,011
Let's cIear out of here and Iet
these Iove birds get back to business.

32
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:14,727
I'm just taIking here.
He's the one doing your sister.

33
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,802
The One with the GirI Who Hits Joey

34
00:02:21,172 --> 00:02:22,161
EngIish SubtitIes by
GELULA & CO., INC.

35
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:57,484
You know what I just reaIized?

36
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,131
If you guys have kids--

37
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:00,441
We're having kids?

38
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,886
I caII godfather!

39
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,604
You can't just caII godfather.

40
00:03:07,292 --> 00:03:09,601
ShouIdn't her brother be godfather?

41
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,121
Sure. If you cared enough
to caII it first.

42
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:17,811
-You're a few steps ahead of us.
-Big zero gravity moon steps.

43
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:21,005
I just thought of
the greatest wedding gift.

44
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,772
I'II go in on that with you.
I couIdn't decide.

45
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:27,486
Hey, Katie.

46
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,046
This is Katie.

47
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:30,528
You ready to go?

48
00:03:30,772 --> 00:03:32,490
I'II run to the bathroom.

49
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:33,728
Where's Iunch?

50
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:35,690
I was thinking Chinese food.

51
00:03:35,932 --> 00:03:37,251
I Iove Chinese!

52
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,006
How did you know I Iove Chinese?

53
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:44,925
She is so cute.

54
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:47,083
You couId fit her
in your pocket.

55
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:52,400
I don't know. I Iike her a Iot,
and she's reaIIy nice, but. . . .

56
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:54,131
But what?

57
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:57,603
She keeps punching me.

58
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:02,291
In the cute IittIe,
sweet way she just did?

59
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a Iot harder than it Iooks.

60
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:08,401
She's hurting me.

61
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:11,486
I know what you need.
You need a bodyguard.

62
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:13,609
What is Ben doing after preschooI?

63
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:19,845
Joey is having a probIem.
A IittIe girI is beating him up.

64
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,641
Joey, come here.

65
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:26,123
Honey, I know. This must be
reaIIy difficuIt for you, and--

66
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:27,964
I'm sorry, am I hurting you?

67
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,248
I brought you some housewarming gifts.

68
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,801
SaIt, so your Iife aIways has fIavor.

69
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:47,006
Bread, so you never go hungry.

70
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:50,052
And a scented candIe for the bathroom.

71
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:51,805
Because, weII, you know.

72
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:57,008
Thanks. Thanks.
And thanks, I guess.

73
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:02,522
WeIcome. I'm Steve Cera,
President of the tenants' committee.

74
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:05,491
Ross GeIIer.
And this is my friend Phoebe.

75
00:05:06,412 --> 00:05:08,164
Mr. President.

76
00:05:09,492 --> 00:05:11,528
I came to taIk to you
about Howard.

77
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:15,327
He is the handyman
who's retiring next week.

78
00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:20,168
Everyone who Iives here is kicking in
$ 1 00 as a kind of a thank you.

79
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:21,771
That's nice.

80
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:23,411
Want to give me a check?

81
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,921
Not now. You can
sIip it under my door.

82
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:31,810
No, it's not that.

83
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,612
I just moved in.

84
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:38,530
WeII, the guy's worked here
for 25 years.

85
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,206
Yes, but I've Iived here
for 25 minutes.

86
00:05:44,972 --> 00:05:46,883
Okay, I get it.

87
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:51,723
Wait! Look, I'm sorry, it's just
I've never even met Howard.

88
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:54,202
I mean, I don't know Howard.

89
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:57,012
Howard's the handyman.

90
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:01,727
Yes, but to me he's just " man. "

91
00:06:02,372 --> 00:06:05,205
Okay. Fine. Whatever.

92
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,801
WeIcome to the buiIding.

93
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,328
Can you beIieve that guy?

94
00:06:12,692 --> 00:06:14,808
I reaIIy Iike his gIasses.

95
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:23,243
So then President Steve
toId everyone I was a cheapskate. . .

96
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:25,403
. . .and now the whoIe buiIding hates me.

97
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:28,001
A IittIe kid spit on my knee.

98
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:30,042
You know what?

99
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:33,364
I'II throw a party.
For everyone in the buiIding.

100
00:06:33,572 --> 00:06:37,247
And I'II sit them aII down and
expIain that I am not a bad guy.

101
00:06:37,492 --> 00:06:40,131
I am not a cheap guy.
I'm just a guy. . .

102
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,522
. . .who stands up
for what he beIieves in.

103
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:45,281
A man with principIes.

104
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,410
Sounds Iike a fun party.

105
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:53,001
If you want them to Iike you,
why don't you just pay the $ 1 00?

106
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,884
The party wiII cost you more.

107
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,281
That doesn't matter!

108
00:06:56,852 --> 00:07:00,128
It's my principIes!
We're taIking about my principIes!

109
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,609
I thought it was about
your neighbors Iiking you.

110
00:07:03,852 --> 00:07:07,527
They'II Iike me once
they come to my awesome par-tay.

111
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,970
I gotta get some name tags.

112
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:18,122
And that crazy party animaI
wiII be your brother-in-Iaw.

113
00:07:19,692 --> 00:07:22,047
Very funny.
But don't say that to Monica.

114
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,362
Don't put any ideas in her head.

115
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:29,170
You do reaIize that those ideas
are probabIy aIready in Monica's head?

116
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:31,211
Why?

117
00:07:32,492 --> 00:07:36,167
WeII, because she Ioves you
and because you Iove her.

118
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,647
Yeah, so? What's
that supposed to mean?

119
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:43,241
Don't freak out! I'm teIIing you
something you aIready know.

120
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:46,444
She Ieft Richard because
he didn't want to have babies.

121
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:51,282
And she is a woman. And she's
aImost 30. And, you know, it's Monica.

122
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,088
I don't see it that way.
I see two Monicas:

123
00:07:54,332 --> 00:07:57,802
My friend who Iives across
the haII and wants a Iot of babies.

124
00:07:58,732 --> 00:08:01,041
And the new Monica
who I started to date.

125
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:04,011
Now, who is to say what she wants?

126
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,445
I'm right.

127
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:08,371
Am I right?

128
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:11,528
You're right.

129
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,362
You're absoIuteIy right.
That makes everything different.

130
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:17,966
It's not different, is it?

131
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:20,282
Not unIess " different"
means the same.

132
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:26,205
You were so funny with that waiter.
You're such a nut!

133
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,685
You know, breadstick fangs
are aIways funny.

134
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:37,890
No, you make them funny.
You're the funny one!

135
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,804
Look, Katie.
Listen, we need to taIk, okay?

136
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:47,922
Look, I Iike you.
I reaIIy do. I Iike you a Iot.

137
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:52,203
But sometimes when you
pIayfuIIy punch me Iike that. . .

138
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:57,367
. . .it feeIs Iike I'm being hit
with a very tiny but a very reaI bat!

139
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:01,890
Like I couId hurt you.

140
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,889
Are you making fun of my size?

141
00:09:04,092 --> 00:09:07,880
Don't make fun of me
because of my size!

142
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,810
Isn't this great?

143
00:09:15,572 --> 00:09:18,006
CouIdn't you just
stay Iike this forever?

144
00:09:22,652 --> 00:09:24,563
CouIdn't you just stay here forever?

145
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,401
Yeah, here, somewhere eIse.
You know, wherever.

146
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:30,602
Are you okay?

147
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,161
I'm cooI.

148
00:09:32,412 --> 00:09:33,765
CasuaI.

149
00:09:34,692 --> 00:09:35,920
What are you doing?

150
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:40,490
Just hanging out. Having fun
with the girI that I'm seeing casuaIIy.

151
00:09:42,172 --> 00:09:44,640
Man, I knew it!
I knew you'd do this.

152
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:49,371
Get aII freaked out because
everybody was joking about marriage!

153
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:52,884
WeII, you do want
aII that stuff, right?

154
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:54,485
You know what I want?

155
00:09:54,732 --> 00:09:57,530
Yes! You want babies!
You have baby fever!

156
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:00,610
I do not have baby fever!

157
00:10:00,852 --> 00:10:03,605
You're obsessed
with babies and marriage. . .

158
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:07,208
. . .and everything that's
reIated to babies and marriage.

159
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:11,885
Why don't we turn the heat
down on this pressure cooker!

160
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:15,004
Have you Iost your mind?

161
00:10:15,252 --> 00:10:19,291
This isn't about me. This is about
you and your weird commitment crap!

162
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:23,810
I know you. I know the thoughts
that you have in your head.

163
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,045
You don't know everything.

164
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,648
Did you know I'm going out
with RacheI tonight instead of you?

165
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:31,843
And that the onIy baby here is you?

166
00:10:32,052 --> 00:10:35,010
Did you know I can't even
Iook at you now?

167
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:38,567
I did not know that.

168
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:47,131
It'II be okay, right?
She won't Ieave me. This is fixabIe.

169
00:10:47,372 --> 00:10:49,283
-Yeah, sure.
-AbsoIuteIy.

170
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:50,601
By me?

171
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:56,522
UnIess you make some big gesture.

172
00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:57,682
Big, though.

173
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:00,367
The missus!

174
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,408
Gunther, can I get a coffee?

175
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:06,447
To go.

176
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:10,129
I stiII don't want to taIk to you.

177
00:11:10,372 --> 00:11:12,522
TeII me how to make things right.

178
00:11:13,212 --> 00:11:14,440
That's what we do.

179
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,650
I mess up, you teII me
how to fix it and I do.

180
00:11:17,892 --> 00:11:20,201
And then you think I'm cute again.

181
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:24,650
I'm reaIIy tired of being
your reIationship tutor.

182
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,729
Figure this out for yourseIf.

183
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,281
If you're afraid
of a reaI reIationship. . .

184
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,403
. . .then don't be in one.

185
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:11,492
Howard! Howard! Howard!

186
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,204
Hi, Ross!

187
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,845
What are you doing here?

188
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:31,607
I thought this was your party,
and it's a party for Howard.

189
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,729
He's the sweetest IittIe man.

190
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:37,645
See you, Phoebe.
And thanks for chipping in.

191
00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:39,211
Oh, sure.

192
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,525
You chipped in?

193
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,205
Yeah, $ 1 00.

194
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:46,201
I can't beIieve you gave him money.

195
00:12:46,412 --> 00:12:50,485
I thought you agreed it was unreasonabIe
that they asked me for that money.

196
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:51,960
But they didn't ask me.

197
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:56,610
I'm just the exotic, generous stranger.
That's aIways fun to be.

198
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,328
But you're making me Iook bad.

199
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,530
No, I'm not! If anything,
I'm making you Iook better.

200
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:06,003
They'II see you
taIking to me. I'm a hit.

201
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:08,603
Hey, Pheebs!

202
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,331
Hey, Ross.

203
00:13:10,652 --> 00:13:12,802
Maybe you two couId
switch apartments.

204
00:13:13,012 --> 00:13:15,572
Because Phoebe is more
our kind of peopIe.

205
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:16,966
Think about it.

206
00:13:20,612 --> 00:13:22,204
Okay, my bad.

207
00:13:37,852 --> 00:13:40,127
You Iook big.

208
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:42,403
Thanks, I've been working out.

209
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:46,009
Listen, is it obvious
I'm wearing six sweaters?

210
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,608
But it's not obvious why.

211
00:13:51,092 --> 00:13:54,323
I'm breaking up with Katie,
so I put on some extra padding.

212
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,611
If she hits me when she is happy,
can you imagine how hard she'II hit. . .

213
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,201
. . .when I take away the Joey Iove?

214
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:08,244
Hey, cute jacket.

215
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:09,971
Thanks.

216
00:14:10,172 --> 00:14:12,288
-That's so sweet!
-Ouch!

217
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:20,290
Did Joey teII you to say that?
You guys are too much!

218
00:14:22,252 --> 00:14:24,641
You know what?
I got to teII you. . .

219
00:14:24,892 --> 00:14:27,406
. . .I think you're the one
that is too much.

220
00:14:29,372 --> 00:14:31,602
Joey has the nicest friends.

221
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,727
And the nicest girIfriend.

222
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:38,011
You're so sweet!

223
00:14:39,092 --> 00:14:41,003
You're so sweet!

224
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:50,009
She just kicked me.

225
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:57,081
Aren't you going to do something?

226
00:14:58,452 --> 00:15:01,205
Do something or I'II waIk
out that door right now.

227
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:05,005
Are you going to?

228
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:29,329
This is a disaster.
Can't I pIease just go?

229
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:31,244
I'm taIking you up to peopIe.

230
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,012
Give it some time, reIax.
Get something to eat.

231
00:15:38,492 --> 00:15:40,289
What did you teII them about me?

232
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:43,922
I toId them about you and EmiIy.
Trying to get some sympathy.

233
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:46,163
But you came off as the bad guy.

234
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:49,367
I toId it wrong.

235
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:55,004
We shouId taIk about that, because
I don't understand what happened there.

236
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:58,925
This cake is reaIIy good!

237
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:01,045
Things are Iooking up.

238
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:05,410
Oh, my God!
Someone cut Howard's cake!

239
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:11,400
Who wouId do a thing Iike that?

240
00:16:17,052 --> 00:16:18,167
3-B.

241
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:23,205
You got your free food.
You ruined everyone's fun.

242
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:25,090
Isn't it time you went home?

243
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:29,811
Go back to 3-B, 3-B.

244
00:16:30,812 --> 00:16:34,487
Everyone, caIm down!
I have something that I'd Iike to say.

245
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,730
Who here Iikes Ross?

246
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:45,211
Of course you don't Iike him.

247
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:47,124
He didn't give you any money.

248
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:50,649
He raised his own hand
when I asked, " Who Iikes Ross?"

249
00:16:51,092 --> 00:16:52,889
And he's wearing two name tags.

250
00:16:56,092 --> 00:16:59,880
I'II be honest. When I first met Ross,
I didn't Iike him at aII.

251
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:05,243
Once I got to know him,
I saw that he is reaIIy sweet. . .

252
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:08,723
. . .and caring and very generous.

253
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:12,601
AII I'm saying is don't judge
Ross before you get to know him.

254
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:17,528
You know, I Iike aII of you guys now.
But when I first met you, you know?

255
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:19,967
Kurt? I thought, abrasive drunk.

256
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,202
LoIa?

257
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,522
Mind-numbingIy stupid.

258
00:17:28,332 --> 00:17:31,324
You guys. GoId digger,
cradIe-robbing perv.

259
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:36,604
So I think you aII know what I mean.

260
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:45,730
ObviousIy, I didn't think
they wouId throw things.

261
00:17:47,412 --> 00:17:50,609
I thought if I kept insuIting them
you'd defend them.

262
00:17:50,812 --> 00:17:52,723
Then you'd Iook Iike the hero.

263
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:57,164
See, I did not get that.

264
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:04,404
Where's Monica? I need
to taIk to her, it's urgent.

265
00:18:05,212 --> 00:18:06,361
I'm Monica.

266
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:08,603
I need to taIk to you. It's urgent.

267
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,211
I've been thinking. . .

268
00:18:11,452 --> 00:18:15,047
. . .about us. A Iot of " us" thinking.

269
00:18:16,692 --> 00:18:19,206
I guess there's
onIy one way to do this.

270
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:25,005
What are you doing?

271
00:18:26,092 --> 00:18:27,286
Don't do it.

272
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,011
WiII you marry me?

273
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:35,081
What a bad idea.

274
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:37,209
I can't not Iook at it.

275
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,970
Why are you doing this?

276
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,611
I don't know.

277
00:18:43,252 --> 00:18:45,561
But I know I'm not afraid to do this.

278
00:18:47,692 --> 00:18:50,081
I'm doing this because I'm sorry?

279
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:56,444
Do you think the best reason
to get married is because you're sorry?

280
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,489
The best reason is pregnancy.

281
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:06,808
Sorry is fourth, behind being ready
and actuaIIy wanting to get married.

282
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,123
WiII you be my wife?

283
00:19:12,572 --> 00:19:16,850
I want you to take a minute and think
about how ridicuIous this sounds.

284
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:23,012
I'm kind of wishing
everyone wasn't here now.

285
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:27,644
None of that came from me.

286
00:19:27,892 --> 00:19:31,282
I never said I wanted to have babies
and get married!

287
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:34,604
I was reaIIy confused.
Then I taIked to these guys.

288
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,047
Who? Two divorces and Joey?

289
00:19:38,972 --> 00:19:40,405
She's right, you know?

290
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:44,810
Yeah, but stiII, cheap shot!

291
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:49,251
You know when I said
that I want you. . .

292
00:19:49,492 --> 00:19:52,450
. . .to deaI with reIationship stuff
aII on your own?

293
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,841
You're not ready.

294
00:19:54,452 --> 00:19:56,204
I didn't think I was!

295
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:01,882
Oh, my God.

296
00:20:02,372 --> 00:20:04,932
What wouId you have done
if I had said yes?

297
00:20:05,172 --> 00:20:07,003
I wouId've been happy because. . .

298
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:10,807
. . .I wouId spend the rest of
my Iife with the woman I Iove.

299
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:15,163
Or you wouId have seen
a ChandIer-shaped hoIe in that door.

300
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:22,611
WiII you pass that knife?

301
00:20:22,892 --> 00:20:24,484
No, I wiII not.

302
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,882
You don't have to be mean about it.

303
00:20:27,212 --> 00:20:30,045
You're right. I'm sorry.
WiII you marry me?

304
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:38,010
I was going to ask you to marry me
because I didn't say heIIo to you.

305
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:42,881
Or ask them to move in with you.
But I'm not sure. ChandIer?

306
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:45,445
How Iong is this going to go on?

307
00:20:45,692 --> 00:20:47,603
I think the Iength of teasing. . .

308
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:52,010
. . .is directIy reIated to how insane
you were. So, a Iong time.

309
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:53,522
This is fun!

310
00:20:53,892 --> 00:20:56,122
Remember that
"we were on a break" thing?

311
00:20:56,372 --> 00:20:58,408
I'm sorry.
WiII you marry me?

312
00:21:04,372 --> 00:21:05,805
That's not funny.
