All of your scheming,

every single day
of your miserable life,

00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,528
what results did you expect,

00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:14,032
that your child would be born
into a happy life?

7
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:16,426
This was our family's hope.

8
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,120
We need to regain
control of the city.

00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,138
You want allies, right?

10

It was certainly a card
I played in the past,

we have Elijah to thank.

one of them a tune,

each other's songs,

Henrik was killed

by the werewolves
in our village.

142
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:59,123
The loss of another child
pushed my mother over the edge.

143
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:04,023
So she used her magic to
turn us into immortals.

144
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:08,060
I think that's when
she loved us the most,

145
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:11,063
but it was her undoing.

146
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:13,733
It triggered
a sequence of events

147

of her long-held secret.

he murdered my real father,

just given away hope.

I can't imagine if
she'd actually died.

157
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:51,570
You know, my siblings
used to tell each other

158
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:55,305
she didn't hate us.

159
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:59,378
She hated herself
for what we'd become.

160
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:01,313
I think they believed that,

even after she tried
to kill us all.

I don't know.

Well, every good story
needs a wicked witch.

166
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:26,122
It'll be all the more
satisfying when we melt her.

167
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,347
So you're not much
of a talker, huh?

168
00:10:35,348 --> 00:10:37,082
No problem.

Last guy I hung out with,
he wouldn't shut up.

[Music playing]

179
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,712
[Door opens]

180
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:20,556
Go away. I'm busy.

181
00:11:20,557 --> 00:11:22,860
Just blatantly
practicing magic, I see.

182
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,997
Herbal remedies for a neighbor
who lost her insurance,

183
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:27,332
but my guess is, an original

184
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,981
ain't here to talk
neighborhood gossip.

185
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:30,368
I have a favor to ask you.

186
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:31,502
Quarter is crawling
with witches.

187
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:33,805
Go ask one of them.

188
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:37,809
Don't typically ask
favors of my enemies.

189
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,824
So you come across
the river to bother me.

190
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,148
It's unfortunate, isn't it?

191
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,653
Bureaucracy has not been
kind to your community.

192
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:51,355
Those tax incentives
on local businesses,

193
00:11:51,356 --> 00:11:53,836
been stalling for months.

194
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:55,359
Of course, a persuasive person

195
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,174
could potentially
remove any red tape.

196
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:01,389
I'm listening.

197
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,634
A certain someone...
Let's say, a witch...

198
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:08,506
Has a troublesome tendency of
jumping into other bodies.

199
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:10,441
When she does so again,

200
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:12,734
I'd like to know
into whom she jumps.

201
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,444
Soul branding.

202
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,413
It's a sacrificial spell.

203
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:18,315
I'm gonna need an item
that's been spelled

204
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:23,420
by the witch in
question and a python.

205
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:26,490
I shall retrieve
the enchanted item.

206
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:28,621
My partner will
take care of the python.

207
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,707
Ew. What?

208
00:12:30,228 --> 00:12:32,429
Second lesson of the day...

209
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,961
Acquisition through
mind compulsion.

210
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:39,802
How the hell do I do
mind compulsion?

211
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,102
Can I help you?

212
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:01,724
I'm most certain that you can.

213
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:10,584
Let me guess.
You need a favor.

214
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:13,621
Painless one, I promise.

215
00:13:13,622 --> 00:13:18,425
There was a necklace I
gave you a long time ago.

216
00:13:18,426 --> 00:13:21,862
It was a leather strap with
a metal bird on the end.

217
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:25,299
Yeah. You gave it to me
when I turned 11.

218
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,567
You remember.

219
00:13:29,336 --> 00:13:31,372
Mikael is back.

220
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:35,603
Elijah is babbling on
about family drama.

221
00:13:43,984 --> 00:13:45,867
Esther: Come here, Klaus.

222
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,371
Birds are sacred to the vikings.

223
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,695
It's how we find land.

224
00:13:54,696 --> 00:13:59,333
It's how your father and
I found our home here.

225
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:01,217
Here.

226
00:14:01,218 --> 00:14:06,764
If ever you are lost or
scared or in need of me,

227
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:09,767
just clasp the bird
and I will come.

228
00:14:09,768 --> 00:14:12,306
Do the others get one?

229
00:14:14,781 --> 00:14:18,351
I love all my children,

230
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:23,657
but you, Niklaus,
you're the most special.

231
00:14:23,658 --> 00:14:29,362
That is why I'm giving
this to you and you alone.

232
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:33,066
Promise me you will
wear it always.

233
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:34,834
I promise.

234
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:37,290
[Flute and drum playing]

235
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:41,141
Your father may
teach you to hunt,

236
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,342
but I shall teach
you to win the heart

237
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:45,970
of the prettiest
girl in the village.

238
00:14:45,971 --> 00:14:49,343
[Both laughing]

239
00:14:51,885 --> 00:14:54,225
Where's your starling necklace?

240
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,103
Oh, must've fallen off.

241
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,134
You need to find it
now, immediately.

242
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:03,829
It's all right, mother.
I found it.

243
00:15:06,632 --> 00:15:12,437
You owe a great thank-you
to your brother, don't you?

244
00:15:13,604 --> 00:15:15,608
Don't you?

245
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,510
Thank you, Finn.

246
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:25,218
Do I even want to know
why you're asking

247
00:15:25,219 --> 00:15:28,217
for a necklace that
your mother gave you?

248
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:31,157
Believe me, Marcel, you want
no part in the latest chapter

249
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,679
of our sprawling family saga.

250
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,197
Thank you for
holding on to this.

251
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:43,302
I've heard from Kol.

252
00:15:43,303 --> 00:15:44,970
He's still looking
for the young witch.

253
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,639
I imagine he'll
find her soon enough.

254
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,240
A shame he'll miss dinner,

255
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:52,077
although it is best that his
new identity remains unknown.

256
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,380
This new witch
you've brought me,

257
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,791
Lenore, she seems
rather stubborn.

258
00:15:56,792 --> 00:16:00,519
Mother, I'd be happy to open
her up to new possibilities.

259
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,171
Have Oliver handle her.

260
00:16:02,172 --> 00:16:06,380
Your means of persuasion
will be needed for dinner.

261
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,427
Have we received any
response to our invitation?

262
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,295
I imagine your message
had quite the effect.

263
00:16:10,296 --> 00:16:13,532
Both he and Elijah have
been on the move all day.

264
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:18,145
Of course.
Clever boys.

265
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:20,603
Make sure you're ready
for them this evening.

266
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,342
I've handled everything
exactly as you've instructed.

267
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:27,145
I'd expect nothing
less from you, Finn.

268
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:36,388
You torture your own?

269
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:39,412
I persuade.

270
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,862
I'd like for you to do the same.

271
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:49,033
She had some visitors
earlier today.

272
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,843
I'd like to know
what they wanted.

273
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,101
Don't dally.

274
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:06,217
Hayley: Your Algiers witch
is being held captive

275
00:17:06,218 --> 00:17:07,528
in the quarter.

276
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:08,787
Oh, perfect.

277
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:10,614
Mother is a step ahead
of us, as usual.

278
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,823
Oliver is with her.

279
00:17:11,824 --> 00:17:12,824
I'll go, and I'll get
her to do the spell,

280
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:13,858
but I need the necklace.

281
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,993
I don't like this...

282
00:17:14,994 --> 00:17:15,960
No. You don't get to ignore me

283
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,363
for days and suddenly act like
you're concerned, Elijah.

284
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:20,432
Just for once, please,
will you trust me

285
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:22,747
that I will do something
and it will get done?

286
00:17:29,197 --> 00:17:31,241
Thank you.

287
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,430
Wait.

288
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:35,914
I don't want to hear...

289
00:17:35,915 --> 00:17:37,515
There's something else.

290
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:38,783
A disciple of Marcel's
was instructed

291
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:40,766
to fetch another ingredient.

292
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:44,022
Ask for Gia.

293
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:47,438
Ok.

294
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,697
What's going on with your two?

295
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:54,097
Nothing.

296
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,604
She's stronger.
That's all that matters.

297
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,038
Gia: A snake.

298
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,607
That was my big
lesson of the day...

299
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:04,251
Snake fetching.

300
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,959
Hold on. You compelled
yourself a snake?

301
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,213
No! I stole the damn thing.

302
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,581
Captain condescension
didn't feel the need

303
00:18:10,582 --> 00:18:13,632
to cover the mind control
chapter in today's lesson.

304
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:15,686
Did you even try?

305
00:18:15,687 --> 00:18:20,191
I don't even know where
to start trying, Marcel.

306
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:22,937
Why Elijah?
I'm not stupid.

307
00:18:22,938 --> 00:18:25,663
You want something from him.

308
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:26,964
I just can't guess
the reason you think

309
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,934
I'm the way to get it.

310
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,902
Actually, I want
something for him,

311
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,115
and it's the same thing
that I want for you.

312
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,658
Which is what?

313
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:39,745
This. Us.
Our new community.

314
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,645
Look. I learned
my lesson the hard way.

315
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,447
You can't make
your way in this town

316
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,581
unless you have an original
looking out for you.

317
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,618
Klaus is so fixated
on those wolves,

318
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:49,620
and Elijah is so
wrapped up in centuries

319
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,789
of his family's old crap
that he can't see it,

320
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,357
but we need him.

321
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:57,633
We need him to see us
as family, too.

322
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:05,736
I couldn't even get my own
family to care about me.

323
00:19:05,737 --> 00:19:08,772
How am I supposed
to win him over?

324
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,069
I've known that man 200 years.

325
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,978
He's cranky.
He's fussy.

326
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,613
He can ride your last nerve,

327
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:22,319
but he has
an Achilles' heel, ok?

328
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,828
He can't help trying
to fix what's broken.

329
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,426
You don't need to be anything

330
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:32,295
other than what
you already are...

331
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,337
Someone who needs his help.

332
00:19:44,674 --> 00:19:47,210
Are these outfits
really necessary?

333
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:50,247
Appears as though we're
showing respect, Niklaus.

334
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:51,681
Mother will be more
likely to surrender

335
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:53,283
her true intentions.

336
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:54,851
Well, I doubt
her guard will drop

337
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:56,186
just because I'm dressed
like a bloody lawyer.

338
00:19:56,187 --> 00:19:58,521
We need every advantage
we can get, Niklaus.

339
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,257
You always did excel
at diplomacy.

340
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,792
Just know if she tries anything,

341
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,462
I'll tear her new body
to pieces.

342
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:07,697
Vincent: Ha ha ha!

343
00:20:07,698 --> 00:20:10,581
You two haven't changed a bit.

344
00:20:13,236 --> 00:20:17,384
Linens and silk can't disguise
your pathetic self-loathing,

345
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:21,077
and you, despite the
arrogant facade,

346
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:23,724
you're still the same
paranoid little boy

347
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:28,766
full of hate and fear.

348
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:37,627
Forgive me.

349
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:40,866
I don't believe
I've had the pleasure.

350
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:43,866
You mean, you
don't recognize me?

351
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,204
Huh?

352
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:49,583
So much for the unbreakable
bonds of family, huh?

353
00:20:49,584 --> 00:20:52,174
Always and forever, indeed.

354
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:55,878
It's been a long time...

355
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,446
Finn.

356
00:20:59,908 --> 00:21:07,054
Now that the introductions are
out of the way, let's eat.

357
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:13,945
Oliver: They worked
her over pretty good.

358
00:21:13,946 --> 00:21:15,513
Hayley: We need to
get her out of here.

359
00:21:15,514 --> 00:21:18,609
What? Well, then what?

360
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,518
They'll know that I let her go.

361
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:22,754
Look. You asked me to
infiltrate Cassie's coven.

362
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:26,257
I'm not gonna blow my cover for
some has-been, hippie witch,

363
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:29,327
no offense.

364
00:21:29,328 --> 00:21:32,130
I guess we could always make
it look like you got jumped,

365
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:35,033
tell Cassie that Lenore
got rescued by her people.

366
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:36,501
Let me guess.

367
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:38,170
You want to beat
the hell out of me,

368
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,466
make it look convincing?

369
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:43,775
Oh, I can't say
I won't enjoy it.

370
00:21:43,776 --> 00:21:45,676
Ok. Just...

371
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:48,304
Just not the face, ok?

372
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,648
Mm.

373
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,271
[Sniffs]

374
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:54,318
What an aromatic Bordeaux.

375
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,622
Well, it was a challenge
to find a good pairing.

376
00:21:57,623 --> 00:22:00,401
What wine goes well
with treachery?

377
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,526
Don't pout, brother.

378
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:05,029
Tonight is meant to be
a happy occasion.

379
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,335
What, exactly,
are we celebrating?

380
00:22:11,336 --> 00:22:13,751
Well, my return, of course.

381
00:22:13,752 --> 00:22:18,213
Remember, I spent
900 years, right,

382
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,544
lying daggered in a box.

383
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:23,447
I'm rather enjoying
this new body,

384
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:28,185
strolling about your lovely city
that you've made your home.

385
00:22:28,186 --> 00:22:32,122
Do tell me, what'd I miss?

386
00:22:32,123 --> 00:22:34,558
Regale me with
your contributions

387
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,861
to society...
Medicine,

388
00:22:37,862 --> 00:22:41,865
philosophy, art...

389
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:44,234
Or have you two
merely cut a path

390
00:22:44,235 --> 00:22:46,870
of destruction across time?

391
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,872
Klaus: The last time we met,
you were helping our mother

392
00:22:48,873 --> 00:22:50,701
try to annihilate the lot of us.

393
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,043
Let's not throw stones
in glass houses.

394
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:55,414
Are we expecting another guest?

395
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,382
Mother will sit at the head,

396
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:01,084
and as for the seat
across from me,

397
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:04,510
that's reserved for
another of our clan.

398
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:07,426
Care to wager an educated guess?

399
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,793
How about a paranoid one?

400
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:11,228
Well, there's no way
Kol would listen

401
00:23:11,229 --> 00:23:12,696
to anything other than his ego.

402
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:15,599
And yet our mother has made
such a compelling argument

403
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,274
that even he, the wildest
of us Mikaelsons, has seen

404
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:24,841
the error of his ways and
accepted his new form with vigor.

405
00:23:24,842 --> 00:23:30,661
Change, dear brothers,
is inevitable.

406
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:35,385
You would dare
face us as a mortal?

407
00:23:35,386 --> 00:23:38,747
The only thing inevitable
is your death.

408
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:44,961
Hmm...

409
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,564
I suppose the honor of carving

410
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:49,925
should go to the oldest.

411
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:55,561
We have much to discuss.

412
00:23:55,562 --> 00:23:59,275
Hayley: It's gonna
be ok, I promise.

413
00:23:59,276 --> 00:24:01,650
What's your dog in this fight?

414
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,402
You're not a Mikaelson.

415
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:05,615
I sort of am in spirit.

416
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,114
The werewolf mother.

417
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,446
Turned witch rescuer,
apparently.

418
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,411
Listen. Can we do
the spell, or not?

419
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:14,621
After what that bitch
and her lackey did to me,

420
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:17,493
I'll do any spell you want.

421
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:19,501
Vincent: I'm rather
enjoying my evening.

422
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:22,045
And I'd enjoy you
getting to the point.

423
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:25,215
I had 900 years to
learn to be patient,

424
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,570
although I am curious why you

425
00:24:27,571 --> 00:24:30,637
kept me daggered in
a box for so long.

426
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:34,310
You were daggered for being
an ever-simpering sycophant.

427
00:24:34,311 --> 00:24:35,812
Did mother bring you
back from the dead

428
00:24:35,813 --> 00:24:38,114
so you could wash her knickers?

429
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:41,482
She raised me because
I was treated unfairly,

430
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:44,954
cheated out of all but the
smallest portion of my life.

431
00:24:44,955 --> 00:24:47,957
Elijah, I can understand such
cruelty coming from him,

432
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:52,295
but I always thought of you as
being the compassionate one.

433
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:55,450
What did I do to deserve you
turning your back on me?

434
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:57,289
Were you afraid of Niklaus?

435
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:00,102
Are you still,
or perhaps jealousy

436
00:25:00,103 --> 00:25:03,333
is why you kept me
locked in a box.

437
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,207
You coveted the duties
of the eldest brother,

438
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,409
in which case, you had
near on a millennium

439
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,278
to fix the problems
of this family

440
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,382
and instead produced
9 centuries of failure.

441
00:25:13,383 --> 00:25:16,892
You might reside...
Somewhat parasitically,

442
00:25:16,893 --> 00:25:19,888
I might add...
In another body,

443
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,558
but let me assure you,
in 900 years,

444
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,962
your tedious sentiments
remain quite the same.

445
00:25:26,963 --> 00:25:31,281
You see, Finn, like father,

446
00:25:31,282 --> 00:25:34,239
you've always despised
our supernatural existence.

447
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,238
Father, of course, slaughtered

448
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:38,740
and consumed his own,
whereas you,

449
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:42,010
you became pretentious and
dull, much like this meal.

450
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:46,615
I will not ask you again.
Where is mother?

451
00:25:46,616 --> 00:25:53,090
Cassie: Ah, my darling
son, I've missed you, too.

452
00:26:04,337 --> 00:26:05,964
So will this take long?

453
00:26:05,965 --> 00:26:07,499
You want me to soul brand
the resurrected spirit

454
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,069
of a 1,000-year-old witch.

455
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,771
It's best I take my time
and do it right.

456
00:26:12,772 --> 00:26:16,274
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

457
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,376
No one should ever
have to lose a child.

458
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,410
No. No one should.

459
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:25,850
You have the talisman?

460
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,040
Yeah.

461
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,189
So how does this work?

462
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,958
You brand Esther with the
spell, and then what?

463
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,526
The next time she
jumps into a body,

464
00:26:35,527 --> 00:26:37,161
she'll be marked with
a distinctive symbol

465
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,221
on the back of her hand.

466
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,032
This way, you always
know who she is.

467
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,020
I'd sooner know why she's here.

468
00:26:43,021 --> 00:26:44,669
When Esther held you captive,

469
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,071
did she give you any idea
why she's doing all this?

470
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,741
Love.

471
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:52,844
How hard did they hit you?

472
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:58,196
What besides love inspires
such pain and cruelty?

473
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,491
And Esther...

474
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,297
Her love is...

475
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,101
Very, very strong.

476
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,431
Klaus: Why don't you say
what you came here to say

477
00:27:19,432 --> 00:27:21,739
so this wretched night can end.

478
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,707
It pains me that you and Elijah

479
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,343
look at me with such disdain.

480
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,612
I wish you could see
that my every action

481
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:30,815
has been to protect you.

482
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,917
You actually believe
that, don't you?

483
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,486
I knew you were a liar,

484
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,904
but now I see you're
utterly delusional.

485
00:27:37,905 --> 00:27:40,090
If you can, forget the
hatred that you cling to

486
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:44,035
and remember all the times
I've mended and healed you.

487
00:27:44,036 --> 00:27:45,195
Ha ha!

488
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:46,897
Elijah, do you recall
the day Niklaus

489
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:49,800
challenged your
father to a duel?

490
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,673
Did I leave your brother
to die alone?

491
00:27:52,674 --> 00:27:54,214
What did I say
when you came to me

492
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,841
and asked me to help him?

493
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,144
That you would rather die

494
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,180
than to watch any
of your children suffer.

495
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,316
Klaus: Aagh! Oh!

496
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,784
Tell me what happened.

497
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:09,189
I challenged him.

498
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,054
What were you thinking?

499
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:13,557
I thought if I could
just best him just once,

500
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,125
he would see that I'm worthy.

501
00:28:15,126 --> 00:28:18,295
You need to hold still.

502
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,451
D'aagh!

503
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,705
Oh...

504
00:28:24,706 --> 00:28:28,004
Niklaus, calm down.

505
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:32,242
Everything is going to be fine.

506
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,256
He laughed at my challenge.

507
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:37,339
He said he would
take this from me

508
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,095
as a prize after defeating me.

509
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:44,287
We began to fight, and
he knocked me down.

510
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:50,760
He cut the bird from my
neck, and I grew so angry,

511
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:56,565
I hit him again and again,
and then I cut him.

512
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:01,238
What happened next?

513
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:07,677
The look on his face, I'd
never seen it before,

514
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:11,585
and I was so proud.

515
00:29:11,586 --> 00:29:18,759
Mother, I held this up to
show him I had kept my prize,

516
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,258
and then he...

517
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,825
Why would...

518
00:29:22,826 --> 00:29:25,628
Your father in his rage

519
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:28,364
struck you with his sword.

520
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,438
I wouldn't let him
take this from me.

521
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:34,649
It was your gift to me.

522
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,708
You're a good boy, Niklaus.
You did the right thing.

523
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:42,778
The necklace.

524
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,781
[Chanting]

525
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,253
It wasn't a spell to protect me.

526
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:54,089
Promise me you will
wear it always.

527
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:57,297
It made me weak.

528
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:00,596
I sought to protect
you from yourself.

529
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:01,931
If you would've

I've already taken
the wolves from Niklaus

707
00:40:53,468 --> 00:40:54,935
and made them my own.

708
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:57,604
It is time now to focus
on the prodigal son Marcel

709
00:40:57,605 --> 00:41:02,442
and his small nest of
vampires across the river.

710
00:41:02,443 --> 00:41:06,079
Now that we have cleansed
the quarter of his kind,

711
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,516
perhaps it's time
to turn our attention

712
00:41:09,517 --> 00:41:13,886
to the outskirts
of our beautiful home.

713
00:41:13,887 --> 00:41:18,758
We will take their pride,
their joy, their love.

714
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:22,362
We will lay it all to ruin,

715
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,064
and when they are at
their lowest point,

716
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,067
in their deepest despair,

717
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,905
they will have no choice
but to beg me

718
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:38,845
to release them from their
pain, and because I love them,

719
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,280
I will.

720
00:41:43,056 --> 00:41:48,294
