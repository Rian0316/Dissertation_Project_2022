1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,690
这是《权力的游戏》里的那把
It's from Game of Thrones.

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,690
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

3
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,500
不知道
I don't know.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,210
如果我们要开始收藏奇幻剧中的刀剑
If we're going to start a fantasy sword collection--

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,470
虽然我很久前就认为应该收藏
and I've long thought we should--

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,860
但真的要从这把开始吗
is this really the sword to start with?

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,470
那你想从哪把开始
What did you have in mind?

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:27,050
我会不假思索地说  亚瑟王的神剑
Well, off the top of my head, I'd have to go with Excalibur.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,570
它能赋予你统治英格兰的权力
It gives you the right to rule England.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,060
那肯定是电影道具的复制品
It would be a replica of a movie prop.

11
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,690
也有道理
Fair enough.

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,940
那就是赋予你统治英格兰复制品的权力
It'd give you the right to rule a replica of England.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,900
这里没有亚瑟王的神剑
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,320
你觉得该怎么办
so what do you want to do?

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,900
真是艰难的抉择
Mm. Tough decision.

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,790
这里没有中国血汗工厂伪造的那种
There's no weaponry from Lord of the Rings

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,520
《指环王》里的武器吗
forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,030
只有比尔博・巴金斯的剑在那边
Just Bilbo Baggins' sword over there.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,030
《指环王》中魔戒曾经的持有者  霍比特人

20
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,470
俩成年男子拿着把霍比特人的短剑  看着不傻吗
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger; wouldn't we look silly?

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,470
霍比特人  《指环王》中的矮人族

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,050
好了  就这把了
Okay, let's go for it.

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,710
两位发现了我的小宝贝
Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,300
是啊
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,470
看着还行
It's okay, I guess.

26
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,200
什么叫还行  它简直了不起
Okay? It's magnificent.

27
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,110
多少钱
What do you want for it?

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,540
很难给本尊出现在付费电视上
Oh, it's hard to put a price on something

29
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,430
其复制品出现在本店里的东西定价
that's a copy of something that was on pay cable.

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,600
不过卖给朋友嘛  就二百五吧
But for my friends, let's say 250?

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,710
你还真是狮子大开口
Oh, that's pretty steep.

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,830
这可是限量版
Well, it's a limited edition.

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,910
只生产了八千把哦
They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.

34
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,640
只有八千把
Only 8,000?

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,860
我们在浪费宝贵时间  快买下
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.

36
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,310
等等
Hang on.

37
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,550
还能少点吗
Can you do any better?

38
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,370
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

39
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,660
这已经是亲友折扣了
I'm already giving you the friends and family discount.

40
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,560
听到了吗
Oh, did you hear that?

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,270
人家都给我们亲友折扣了
We're getting the friends and family discount.

42
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,780
我们很荣幸  这就买了
We are honored and we will take it.

43
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,670
慢着
Slow down.

44
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,440
二百块
Two hundred.

45
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,300
你在做什么啊
What are you doing?

46
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,800
二百五已经是折扣价了
250 is already the discounted price.

47
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,110
闭嘴吧你
Will you shut up?

48
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,130
这样吧  二百三十五好了
Tell you what, I'll go 235.

49
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,520
那算了  下次买吧
Nope. Maybe another time.

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,590
好吧  二百二十五  这是最终报价
Okay, 225-- my final offer.

51
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,270
买下吧  买下吧
Take it, take it.

52
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,380
二百块
Two hundred.

53
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,630
天  你是要杀了我
Man, you're killing me!

54
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,620
杀你?  我都喘不过气了
Killing you? I can't breathe.

55
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,240
二百一吧  亏本卖了
210, and I'm losing money.

56
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,290
不能欺人太甚  莱纳德  太对不起了
Oh, now, we can't let him lose money, Leonard. I'm so sorry.

57
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,410
二百一  再送个《钢铁侠》里的头盔
210 and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.

58
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,100
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

59
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,180
那头盔上有小罗伯特・唐尼的签名
That helmet's signed by Robert Downey Jr.

60
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,180
《钢铁侠》主演

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,770
那又怎样
So?

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,010
好吧  如果你要质疑
Okay, if you're going to question

63
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,510
一个来自漫画改编的电影  还有演员签名的
the importance of an actor's signature on a plastic helmet

64
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,450
塑料头盔的重要性
from a movie based on a comic book,

65
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,570
那我们这群人的生活  还有什么意义可言
then all of our lives have no meaning!

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,780
好吧
Okay, fine.

67
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,720
就这把剑  二百一
Just the sword, 210.

68
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
谢谢
Thank you.

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,900
这周有肉吃啦
I can eat meat this week.

70

看到没
See that?

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,540
我帮我们省了四十块
I just saved us 40 bucks.

72
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,600
我早就说过  你学术知识的匮乏
I've long said, what you lack in academic knowledge

73
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,660
全弥补在市井小民的小聪明上了
you make up for in street smarts.

74
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,620
要包起来吗
You want me to wrap it?

75
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,420
不用了
No, it's okay.

76
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,920
我要用它直刺我朋友胸口
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

77
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,540
嗨  斯图尔特
Hey, Stuart.

78
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,800

嗨  谢尔顿
Hi, Sheldon.

好剑
Nice sword.

82
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,870
这是我刀剑收藏中的其中一把
It's part of my sword collection.

83
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,370
-你有收藏刀剑吗  -没有
- Do you have a sword collection?  - No.

84
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,180
我一点都不奇怪
I'm not surprised.

85
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,790
这是《蝙蝠侠》第612期
Here's the Batman 612

86
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,180
有你想要的吉姆・李重新画的封面
with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.

87
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,180
《蝙蝠侠》作者之一

88
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,990
太棒了  多少
Awesome. What do I owe you?

89
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,030
四十块
40 bucks.

90
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,900
真划算
Good deal.

91
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
笨蛋
Sucker.

92
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,360
他都没要个亲友折扣
Didn't even ask for the friends and family discount.

93
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,600
周五我要在家办个派对
Hey, I'm having a party at my house on Friday,

94
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,050
希望你能来
and I was hoping you would stop by.

95
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,230
有女孩子吗
Will there be girls there?

96
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,320
当然有
Yeah, of course.

97
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,900
上次就没有
'Cause there wasn't last time.

98
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,970
这次肯定有
There will be girls.

99
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,200
你们想来的话  我也邀请你们哦
You guys are invited if you want to come by.

谢谢你
Thank you.

回见
Later.

103
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,390
我知道你的小把戏
I see what you're doing.

104
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,630
你接受了
You accept an invitation

105
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,820
去我死敌家参加派对的邀请
to a party at the home of my sworn enemy,

106
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,560
他就会大肆宣扬  我们俩会去
he tells everyone we're going to be there,

107
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,500
而我们不去  他就成了傻瓜
and when we don't show, he looks the fool.

108
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,310
很坏很聪明
Fiendishly clever.

109
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,600
我是真的想去
I was actually thinking about going.

110
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,330
去了说一句  这派对烂死了  然后摔门而去
And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out,

111
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,490
让他在客人面前颜面尽失
leaving him humiliated in front of his guests.

112
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,820
我喜欢
Love it.

113
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,570
不是  我要带上拉杰和霍华德
No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard

114
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,110
我们要好好玩
and have a good time.

115
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,740
太好了  僧多粥少
Oh, great, more guys.

116
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,590
威尔・惠顿又筹办了一个光"棍"派对
It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.

生活大爆炸  第五季第五集

126
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,250
谢尔顿  能给拿瓶水吗
Sheldon, can you grab me a water?

127
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,400
可能可以
Possibly.

128
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,120
到底可不可以
Can you or can't you?

129
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,030
这事没那么简单  莱纳德
It's not that simple, Leonard.

130
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,090
什么到你那  都复杂了
It never is, is it?

131
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,550
目前  咱俩的关系
At this moment,our relationship exists

132
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,970
处于两种相互矛盾的状态
in two mutually contradictory states.

133
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,790
在你决定去  或是不去
Until you either do not go or go

134
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,070
威尔・惠顿的派对之前
to Wil Wheaton's party,

135
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,080
你是我的朋友  同时又不是我的朋友
you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend.

136
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,560
我把这个现象称为
I'm characterizing this phenomenon

137
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
薛定谔的猫是关于量子理论的一个理想实验

138
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
薛定谔的友谊
as Schrodinger's Friendship.

139
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,880
明白了  可以把水给我了吗
Got it. Can I have my water?

140
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,370
当然
Of course.

141
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,760
自己捡去吧  你这个叛徒
Now get it yourself, you traitor.

142
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,170
等一下  这到底是怎么回事
Wait, what is going on?

143
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,510
忘了我就再提醒你一下
In case you have forgotten,

144
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,920
薛定谔的猫是个理想实验
Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment...

145
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,760
不  不  我没忘
No, no, I didn't forget.

146
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,530
他把一只猫装进了盒子  在你打开盒子之前
Um, there's this cat in a box and until you open it,

147
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,010
猫要么死  要么活  要么半死半活
it's either dead or alive or both.

148
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,000
尽管在我内布拉斯卡州的老家
Although, back in Nebraska,

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,170
我们家的猫钻进了我哥露营用的行李箱里
our cat got stuck in my brother's camp trunk,

150
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,400
我们不用打开就知道
and we did not need to open it

151
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,880
里面肯定装满了各式各样的死猫
to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

152
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,610
会讲家常小故事  懂点物理
Homespun stories, knowledge of physics

153
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,820
同时还具有傲人的双峰
and a bosom that defies it.

154
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,010
你还真是全才啊
You're the whole package, aren't you?

155
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,180
抱歉  我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

156
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,290
我有好消息要宣布
Uh, I got great news.

157
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,500
NASA[国家航空航天局]选中了我们小组
NASA picked my team's design

158
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,380
设计的深空太空望远镜
for the deep field space telescope

159
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,360
今春天就要把这个设计用在国际空间站上了
that's going on the International Space Station this spring.

160
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,150
华仔  这太棒了
Howie, that's wonderful!

161
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,380
恭喜你
Congratulations!

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,240
精彩的还在后头呢
It gets better.

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,570
安装的时候还要派一个人
Someone has to go up with the telescope

164
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,930
作为装备专家上太空
as a payload specialist,

165
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,410
猜猜他们选中谁了
and guess who that someone is.

166
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,430
穆罕默德・李
Muhammad Li.

167
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,290
穆罕默德・李是谁
Who's Muhammad Li?

168
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,890
穆罕默德是全球最普遍的名
Muhammad is the most common first name in the world,

169
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,760
而李则是最普遍的姓氏
Li, the most common surname.

170
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,850
因为我不知道答案
As I didn't know the answer,

171
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,460
但我觉得这么猜  在数学上比较靠谱
I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.

172
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,820
他们选中我  谢尔顿
It's me, Sheldon.

173
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,330
是我
It's me.

174
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,640
我要上太空了
I'm going up in space!

175
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,420
严格来说  我是宇航员了
Technically, I'm an astronaut.

176
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,740
帅呆了
That's amazing!

177
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,050
等会儿
Hang on a second.

178
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,940
NASA已经没有航天飞机了
NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.

179
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,020
你怎么上太空呀
How are you going to get up there?

180
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,120
这个过程就酷了
Oh, well, it's really cool.

181
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,470
你先飞到莫斯科  然后他们带你去哈萨克斯坦
You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan,

182
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,600
然后你再登上一个俄罗斯联盟号火箭
and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket

183
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,560
直接冲上低空地球轨道
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,980
又或是你只能呆坐在火箭发射台上
Or just sits there on the launch pad

185
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,110
因为哈萨克黑手党
because the Kazakhi mafia

186
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,550
把火箭燃料都拿到黑市上去卖了
sold the rocket fuel on the black market.

187
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,920
这些俄罗斯火箭安全吗
Are those Russian rockets safe?

188
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,760
切尔诺贝利事件也是这帮俄罗斯人弄出来的
Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built

189
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,170
安全性可见一斑吧
by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.

190
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,540
我们大家来敬他一杯吧
I'd like to propose a toast.

191
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,570
我们在座的各位  都有登上太空的梦想
The dream to go up into space is one we all share,

192
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,680
而今天霍华德  实现了这个梦想
and Howard's making that a reality.

193
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,360
我们都以你为傲
We're all very proud of you.

194
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,730
干杯
Cheers.

195
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,200
敬酒词说的不错呀
That was a lovely toast.

196
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,290
-口头表扬一次  -谢谢
- Kudos.  - Thank you.

197
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,400
与此同时  你的敬酒词也老套得让人反胃
Simultaneously, a festival of cloying cliche.

198
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,090
你恶心死我了
You sicken me.

199
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,070
你怎么这么安静
You're really quiet.

200
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,460
没事吧
Is everything okay?

201
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,980
没事
Fine.

202
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,290
只是有点累了
Just a little tired.

203
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,340
希望你别太累  因为我现在可是
I hope not too tired, because I'm feeling

204
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,100
"阳刚"十足哦
particularly masculine right now.

205
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,980
蓄势待发  你明白我意思吧
All systems go, if you catch my drift.

206
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,540
我一向明白你意思
I always catch your drift.

207
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,490
好吧  你很明显是有心事
All right, well, something's obviously bugging you.

208
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,180
到底怎么了
What is it?

209
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,280
我只是不敢相信你居然
I just can't believe you signed up

210
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,270
都不跟我商量就决定上太空了
for the space program without even talking to me.

211
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,420
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

212
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,980
你是在担心我
You're worried about me.

213
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,170
你真是贴心啊  宝贝儿
That is so sweet.

214
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,270
在我们NASA有一句老话
You know, there's a saying we have at NASA.

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,690
太空英雄之所以成为英雄
What makes the right stuff so right

216
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:17,750
是因为他们能平安归来
is that it always comes home.

217
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,590
你就闭嘴吧  霍华德
Just stop talking, Howard.

218
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,800
我跟你说我要成为宇航员时
This isn't the reaction I expected

219
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,800
我可没想到你会是这么个反应
when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.

220
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,760
那你以为我会是什么反应
What did you think was going to happen?

221
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,290
实话吗  当然是滚床单
Honestly? Sex.

222
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:34,930
霍华德
Howard.

223
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,290
你知道这是多大的事吗
Do you realize what a big deal this is?

224
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,430
你知道被选中上太空是何等的荣誉吗
What an honor it is to be chosen to go into space?

225
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,420
我明白
Yeah, I get it.

226
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,300
我只是希望你做决定之前能跟我商量一下
I just wish you included me in the decision.

227
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,160
咱俩应该是人生搭档
We're supposed to be partners.

228
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,270
应该是站在同一战线的
We're supposed to be a team.

229
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,450
对不起  你说的没错
I'm sorry. You're right.

230
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,300
好吧  咱重头来一次
Okay, let's try this again.

231
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,640
伯纳黛特  我现在遇到一个千载难逢的机遇
Bernadette, an opportunity has come up

232
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:05,200
事关咱俩  所以我想跟你商量一下
that impacts both of us, and I'd like to discuss it.

233
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,180
好吧
Okay.

234
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,470
我被NASA选中
I've been offered a chance to go up

235
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,750
要去国际空间站待上三个星期
to the International Space Station for three weeks.

236
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,220
你怎么想
What are your thoughts on that?

237
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,310
首先  我想谢谢你
Well, first of all, thank you

238
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,000
在做决定之前想到要跟我商量
for including me in the decision-making process.

239
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,720
那是当然  咱俩可是一个阵营的
Hey, we're a team.

240
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,990
那说说你的想法吧
So, what do you think?

241
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,810
不行
No.

242
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,460
不行
No?

243
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,090
不行
No.

244
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,400
为什么不行
Why not?

245
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,630
霍华德  我父亲是个警察
Howard, my father was a police officer.

246
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,390
我们家人每天都提心吊胆的
We never knew from one night to the next

247
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,540
不知道他晚上能不能活着回到家
if he was going to come home alive.

248
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,830
那感觉糟透了
It was horrible.

249
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:49,130
我不希望跟你以后的生活也是这个样子
And I don't want to live that way with you.

250
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,990
我十一岁的时候
Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother

251
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,840
我爸就抛弃了我和我妈
when I was 11.

252
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,840
我们从那以后再没见过他
We never saw him again.

253
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,780
说啥都没用  反正我就是不许你上太空
Oh, boo-hoo, you're not going to space!

254
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,230
霍华德还挺有能耐的  对吧
Pretty cool about Howard, huh?

255
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,160
别装作咱俩之间好像没事一样
Don't talk to me as if nothing's happened between us.

256
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,410
不过没错  他是挺有能耐的  兄弟
And yes, it sure is, buddy.

257
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,450
老天啊  你能不能别再玩薛定谔那一套了
For God's sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.

258
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,270
你想要像海森堡不确定性原理
Would you prefer a simpler application

259
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,940
一个粒子的位置和它的动量不可被同时确定

260
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,940
那样更简单的程序吗
of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,

261
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,820
我现在不能同时确定
in which I could either

262
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,940
你到底是哪方的或我是否喜欢你
know where you are or whether I like you,

263
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,780
不过现在两者都不确定
but not both.

264
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,630
你是从不知道住嘴的  是吧
You never stop talking, do you?

265
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,360
我不明白
I don't understand.

266
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,150
莱纳德去不去威尔・惠顿的派对
What differences does it make

267
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,900
有什么区别
if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton's party?

268
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,640
威尔・惠顿是谢尔顿的死敌
Wil Wheaton is Sheldon's mortal enemy.

269
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,140
死敌
Mortal enemy?

270
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,150
谢尔顿  我知道你是个
Sheldon, I know you're a bit

271
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,400
十分别扭的人  但是
of a left-handed monkey wrench, but...

272
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,650
你真的有个死敌吗
you really have a mortal enemy?

273
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,220
其实我有61个
In fact, I have 61 of them.

274
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,540
你想看看我的黑名单吗
Would you like to see the list?

275
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,080
说不要  说不要  说不要
Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.

276
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,470
刚刚才把你从名单上剔除
You just got off the list.

277
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,430
是不是又想回去了
Would you like back on it?

278
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,100
这要稍等一下
This'll just take a moment.

279
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,090
名单存在一张5.25英寸软盘里
It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

280
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,750
你还用软盘啊
A floppy disk?

281
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,260
我九岁就开始列这个名单了
Well, I started the list when I was nine.

282
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,760
威尔・惠顿为啥被列入名单了
How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?

283
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,010
-老天  -别问啊
- Oh, God! - Oh! Come on!

284
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,840
我小的时候非常喜欢卫斯理・柯洛夏
As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher,

285
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,780
即威尔・惠顿在《星际迷航》里的角色
Wil Wheaton's character on <i>Star Trek.</i>

286
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,480
我坐了几小时巴士  去参加一个星际迷航大会
So, I drove for hours by bus to a <i>Star Trek</i> convention

287
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,570
威尔・惠顿本来是要出席的
at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear,

288
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,690
我要找他给我的卫斯理・柯洛夏玩具签名
so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed.

289
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,390
可他压根就没出现
But he never showed, because

290
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,700
因为他去玩"好莱坞框框"了
apparently, it was cooler for him

291
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,700
好莱坞框框：著名游戏节目

292
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,390
他觉得坐左下角那框框里更酷
to be the lower-left corner on <i>Hollywood Squares.</i>

293
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,390
嘉宾坐在九个特制的框框里回答问题

294
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,630
该死
Oh, damn!

295
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,300
软盘挂了
The floppy failed.

296
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,870
好吧  不管是谁在1989年
Well, whoever was in charge of quality control

297
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,970
负责威宝公司的质量控制
at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989,

298
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,880
恭喜他  他进了我的黑名单
congratulations, you just made the list.

299
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:00,820
霍华德
Howard?

300
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,610
改变主意要滚床单了吗
Change your mind about sex?

301
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,600
虽然还生气  但我会委曲求全
I'm still mad, but I'll do it.

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,850
不是  我刚刚一直在想
No, I've just been thinking.

303
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,560
我担心你的安危并不重要
It doesn't matter if I'm afraid for your safety.

304
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,540
重要的是  我不想成为那个
I don't want to be the person

305
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,420
阻碍你追逐梦想的人
who stands between you and your dreams.

306
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:18,670
真的吗
Really?

307
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,790
真的
Really.

308
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,630
如果去太空真的对你很重要
If going into space means that much to you,

309
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,180
我不会再说一句反对的话
I will never say another word about it.

310
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,900
谢谢
Thank you.

311
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,270
我爱你
I love you.

312
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,840
我也爱你
I love you, too.

313
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:34,100
那现在开滚[床单]了吗
So, sex now?

314
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,930
好
Okay.

315
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,990
不过我刚忘了刷牙
I just forgot to brush my teeth.

316
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,630
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

317
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,120
哦  宝贝 *
* Oh, baby

318
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,440
我...*
* I'm

319
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,270
我爱的不是你 *
* I'm not in love with you...

320
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,370
除非我死  否则我儿子休想去太空
Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!

321
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:11,030
我准备好了
I'm ready.

322
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:15,750
等等  先看看我理解得对不对
Wait, let me see if I got this right.

323
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,970
你真的半夜
You actually asked Bernadette

324
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,350
把伯纳黛特赶出了家门?
to leave your house in the middle of the night?

325
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,240
我有得选吗
What choice did I have?

326
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,520
她背着我
She went behind my back

327
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,700
告发我妈来反我
and turned my own mother against me.

328
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,200
哇  你不仅是我们中的第一个宇航员
Wow. You're not only our first astronaut.

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,980
还是我们中第一个把女孩子赶下床的人
You're also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed.

330
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,980
你简直就是个巨星啊
You're like a rock star.

331
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,810
有点吧
Little bit.

332
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,670
我不想这么说  但她确实背叛了你
I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.

333
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,880
真有意思
Interesting.

334
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,610
你能看出别人的背叛行为  却看不出你自己的
You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.

335
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,690
去惠顿的派对不是背叛你
Going to Wheaton's party is not betraying you.

336
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,600
你当然会这么认为
Oh, of course you would have to believe that.

337
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,560
邪恶的人永远认为自己是对的
Evil always thinks it's doing right.

338
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,290
"喂  突击兵"
"Excuse me, Stormtrooper. "

339
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,020
引自《星球大战》

340
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,020
"这些才是你要找的机器人"
"These are the droids you're looking for."

341
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,170
我是去参加派对
I'm going to a party.

342
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,480
又不是叫R2-D2和C-3PO机器人反帝国
I'm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!

343
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,790
时候未到而已
Not yet.

344
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,140
那接下来怎样
So, what's gonna happen next?

345
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,200
你和伯纳黛特会分手吗
Are you and Bernadette going to break up?

346
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,790
我不知道
I don't know.

347
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,960
就算我们要复合
If we're going to get back together,

348
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,500
她也要先道歉  并且接受
she's going to have to apologize and accept  that

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,360
我是个大男人  我能自己拿主意
I'm a grown man who can make his own decisions.

350
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,040
然后她还要说服你妈  让你去太空
Then she's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.

351
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,720
必须的
Obviously.

352
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,340
我没有别的办法
I had no choice.

353
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,130
我必须告诉他妈
I had to tell his mother.

354
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,750
他不能去太空
He can't go to space.

355
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,180
他还是只小雏鸟呢
He's like a baby bird.

356
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,150
你知道他有一次
Do you know he once got an asthma attack

357
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,030
因为看图书馆的旧书引发哮喘吗
from reading an old library book?

358
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,200
开玩笑的吧
You're kidding.

359
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,940
真的  我那天还在场呢
No, I was there that day.

360
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,560
谢尔顿递那本书给他时  还闪到腰了
Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.

361
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,040
我不知道自己该怎么办
I don't know what I'm going to do.

362
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,890
我不想因此和他分手
I don't want to break up over this.

363
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,340
好吧  那你直接跟他说你错了
Okay, why don't you just tell him you made a mistake?

364
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,130
你们觉得我做错了吗
Do you guys think it was a mistake?

365
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,490
我这样是不是太小人了
Am I the bad guy in this?

366
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,060
这事轮不到我们来评论
It's not for us to judge.

367
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,970
我们只是来支持你  安慰你
We're just here to provide comfort and support

368
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,460
你要自己面对你的小人之举
while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you've done.

369
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,810
天啊  你说得对
Oh, God, you're right.

370
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,230
我把我们的爱扔到了他那肥婆老妈脚下
I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother.

371
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,440
我得去道歉
I need to apologize.

372
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,190
那也对  我很高兴你想通了
Well, that-that's good. I'm glad you came to that.

373
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,180
不过在此之前  我想问你一个重点问题
But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.

374
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,690
什么问题
What?

375
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,410
你确定一定以及肯定
Are you 100% positive

376
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:39,840
你爱霍华德・沃罗威茨而且想嫁给他吗
you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?

377
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,450
当然  发自肺腑地想
I do, with all my heart.

378
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,730
明白了  就是确认一下
Got it.  Just had to check.

379
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,960
他是好男人哦
He's great.

380
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,980
谢尔顿
All right, Sheldon.

381
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,160
我们要去威尔家了
We're going to Wil's.

382
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,630
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

383
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,850
不对  莱纳德  这是你最后的机会
No, Leonard, this is <i>your</i> last chance.

384
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,890
总有一天
One day,

385
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,640
会有一位历史学家来问你
a historian is going to come to you and say,

386
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,890
你真的曾是谢尔顿・库珀博士的朋友吗
"Is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper?"

387
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,790
然后你就会一边
And you're going to have to

388
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,880
饱含悔恨与耻辱地呜咽着
choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation

389
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,950
一边说  没错  但是
as you mumble, "I was, but

390
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,390
我当初选择去了一个
I chose to go to a party

391
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,260
由威尔・惠顿出演的少年成长题材的电影  1986年出品

392
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:19,260
由不知名电影《伴我同行》里某人办的派对
thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."

393
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,000
-你想开车吗  -好啊
- You want to drive? - Sure.

394
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:30,960
-喂  谢尔顿  -太好了
- Hey, Sheldon? - Oh, good.

395
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,820
你选了我  你最后还是选了我
You picked me, you picked me.

396
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,950
不  我就是刚收到斯图尔特的一条短信
No, I just got a text from Stuart.

397
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,310
著名演员兼编剧  代表作有《星际迷航之复仇女神》

398
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,310
布伦特・斯派尔也在派对上
Brent Spiner is at the party.

399
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,380
布伦特・斯派尔
Brent Spiner?

400
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,530
对
Yes.

401
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,010
我没兴趣
I don't care.

402
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,620
真的吗
Really?

403
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,540
布伦特・斯派尔
Brent Spiner,

404
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,690
数据先生的扮演者  你可喜欢他了
Mr. Data himself. You love him.

405
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:53,010
以前喜欢  但我现在已经对《星际迷航》不感冒了
I did, but I think I've kind of outgrown <i>Star Trek.</i>

406
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,230
你看啊  角色又老套
You know, stock characters,

407
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,080
《星际迷航》里的经典台词

408
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,080
情节又离谱  "传送我吧"
ludicrous plots, "Beam me up."

409
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,070
真是满嘴荒唐言啊
What a load of hooey.

410
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,170
我走了
I'm going.

411
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,740
《星际迷航》里的斯波克的经典台词和手势

412
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,740
生生不息  繁荣昌盛哦  谢尔顿
Live long and prosper, Sheldon.

413
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,120
嗯啊  随你怎么样  看着真傻
Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.

414
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,830
霍华德  伯纳黛特来了
Howard, Bernadette's here!

415
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:16,230
跟她说我不在家
Tell her I'm not home!

416
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,100
你怎么可以装得这么蹩脚
What kind of a schmuck play is that?!

417
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,290
她听得见你大声嚷嚷
She can hear you shouting!

418
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,020
能说句话吗
Can we talk?

419
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,810
你说啊  我没什么可说的
You can. I have nothing to say.

420
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,740
好吧
All right.

421
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,310
我就是想告诉你
I just wanted to tell you

422
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,470
我不该给你妈妈打小报告的  我很抱歉
I'm sorry I said something to your mother.

423
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,890
我本来是打算最后告诉她的
I was gonna tell her eventually,

424
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,420
可你居然背着我
but you went behind my back.

425
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,070
我知道  我错了
I know. I'm sorry.

426
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,740
我当时害怕啊
I got scared.

427
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,660
如果你要爱我
If you're gonna love me,

428
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,970
你就得爱我的全部
you're gonna have to love the whole package:

429
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:49,830
温柔诗人和疯狂泼皮都是我啊
the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.

430
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,400
我知道
I know.

431
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,010
如果你不是真心的就别这么说
Well, don't say it if you're not gonna mean it,

432
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,620
因为我不止要去空间站
'cause I'm not just gonna stop with the space station.

433
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,970
我还想去月球  想去火星
Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars.

434
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,340
想乘坐单人潜艇到大洋的最深处
I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.

435
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,440
真的吗
Really?

436
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,880
你在加勒比海盗船上都晕船了
You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.

437
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,290
那几个胖小子非要摇来摇去
Well, those big kids were rocking it.

438
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,290
我之前那么做只是因为我太爱你了
I just did what I did because I love you so much,

439
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,800
我抑制不住害怕失去你的担心
and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.

440
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,420
真的吗
Really?

441
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,090
你是我的灵魂伴侣
You're my soul mate.

442
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,350
你现在该吻我了
This is where you kiss me.

443
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,270
对对
Right, right.

444
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,690
你想干嘛都随你
Make up all you want!

445
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,320
但你休想离开地球半步
Your tuchis is not leaving this planet!

446
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,150
你知道那个在《星际迷航之第一次接触》里
Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays

447
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,300
扮演博格女王的漂亮女演员吗
the Borg Queen in <i>First Contact</i>?

448
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,360
-知道啊  -我刚刚碰到她的妇科医生了
- Yeah. - Well, I just met her gynecologist!

449
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,730
你来这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

450
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,590
为我们的友谊奋斗
Fighting for our friendship.

451
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,690
尽管你古怪又讨人嫌
As peculiar and annoying as you can be,

452
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,720
但你还是我的好哥们儿
you're still my little buddy.

453
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,550
今晚我不能让我们的友谊在这里毁掉
I'm not going to let that end here tonight.

454
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,220
赶紧把杯子放下  咱见完布伦特・斯派尔就走人
