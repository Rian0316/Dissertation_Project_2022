1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
Okay, it's done.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,120
Look, guys, for the future,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,860
I don't mind killing the big spiders,

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,070
But you have to at least try with the little ones.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:08,900
Penny, please.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,630
We're facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,000
Sheldon, it's not so bad.

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,370
Not bad? it's horrible.

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,910
I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing,

10
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,930
?
But you never think it'll happen to you.

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,070
So they steamed your dumplings.

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,830
Get over it.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,430
New topic, please.

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,900
All right, penny.

15
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,840
?
Let me take this opportunity to point out

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,430
That you are looking particularly ravishing today.

17
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,800
Not with a thousand condoms, howard.

18
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,970
So, there is a number.

19
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
Okay, new topic, please.

20
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,600
5A
Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5a are moving out?

21
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,130
-  ?  -
- No, shh-shh-shh! - what?!

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,170
The people upstairs are moving out.

23
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,770
No!

24
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,230
The horror...

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Why would you just say something like that?

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,230
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,470
How else was I supposed to say it?

28
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,360
Slowly. like putting a new fish in a tank.

29
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,130
You don't just drop it in.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,370
You let the bag sit in the water a while.

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,130
The horror...

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,070
Sheldon, I'm sure it's going to be fine.

33
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,770
No, it's not going to be fine.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,900
Change is never fine.

35
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,330
They say it is, but it's not.

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,400
?
Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?

37
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,900
I never met them.

38
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,570
That's what made them perfect.

39
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,800
There were no awkward "hellos" in the halls.

40
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,270
There's no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors.

41
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,450
?
They may as well have been a family of

42
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,030
Cats just jumping around from drape to drape.

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,600
Without that annoying ammonia urine smell.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,230
Well, I'm sure the new people will be just as quiet.

45
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,700
You can't know that.

46
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,270
How can you possibly know that?

47
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,000
You're right, I can't. you know what?

48
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,800
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

49
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,540
an opera singer,

50
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,030
the cast of stomp...

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,200
Yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.

52
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,830
Why are you making it worse?

53
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,370
I tried making it better. he wouldn't go for it.

54
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,470
You're right! that's a great idea.

55
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,330
- What? - I'll take the apartment upstairs.

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,570
I can finally get away from my mother

57
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,270
And we can all spend some more time together.

58
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,800
If you catch my drift.

59
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,370
The horror...

60
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,470
Hold on.

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,920
You honestly expect me to believe

62
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,760
that social protocol dictates we

63
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,770
Break our backs helplping wolowitz move,

64
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,900
and then he only need buy us a pizza?

65
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,470
I'm sorry, that really is how it works.

66
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,400
You' tricking me.

67
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,400
You tell me the truth, what do we get?

68
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,200
Raj, help me out here.

69
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,330
PS3[]
You get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3.

70
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,030
I knew it!

71
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,670
PS3  PS3
Ps3, definitely ps3.

72
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,370
Who would pick a mountain bike?

73
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,370
?
Enough with the guilt, ma.

74
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,900
We'll still see each other.

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,870
I'll come over every night and have dinner with you.

76
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,170
The hell you will!

77
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,600
What am I running here, a fancy restaurant?

78
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,130
Does this look like olive garden?!

79
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,300
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

80
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,200
You don't want to see your little bird leave the nest.

81
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,670
"little bird"?

82
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,570
30?
You're almost 30!

83
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,200
Fly, for god's sake!

84
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,900
?
Fine, I'll stay!

85
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,030
Ya happy, crazy lady?

86
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,240
I sure as hell hope so,

87
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,070
because you're ruining my life!

88
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,670
Hey, penny? it's leonard.

89
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,870
?
Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.

90
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,730
I guess I won't be needing this.

91
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,500
Oh, no...

92
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,000
The new ones.

93
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,470
They're here.

94
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,430
Stay calm. we don't know anything about them yet.

95
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,130
What are you doing?

96
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
I'm checking for musical instruments.

97
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,300
Does that sound like castanets to you?

98
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,100
The box says "kitchen."

99
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,190
So?

100
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,930
do cocaine smugglers write "cocaine" on the box?

101
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,670
Hello?

102
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,430
-  -
Hello. hello.

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,800
-  -  -
Hello. hello. hello.

104
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,770
I'm Alicia.

105
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm moving in upstairs.

106
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,000
That is so great.

107
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,600
Oh, I'm leonard.

108
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,900
I live downstairs.

109
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,900
Upstairs from here, but under you.

110
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,630
Not under you per se, but under your apartment.

111
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,530
That's nice.

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,770
Yeah, it is.

113
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,800
If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate...

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,870
Hello.

115
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,970
Hello.

116
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,070
Hello.

117
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,380
On a scale of one to ten

118
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,700
How light of foot would you describe yourself

119
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,210
With one being not cat-like at al

120
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,270
And ten being freakishly feline?

121
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,170
"freakishly feline"?

122
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,300
Is that your answer or do you not understand the question?

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,470
We'll come back to that one.

124
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,670
Sheldon...

125
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,230
Hang on.

126
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,810
Are you now or have you ever been a salsa

127
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,400
Irish folk or break-dancer?

128
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,100
?
No.

129
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,470
You're making her uncomfortable.

130
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,930
Oh, I'm sorry.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,030
Well, if it helps you feel any better

132
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,070
you're doing very well so far.

133
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,030
Next question,are you fertile?

134
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,570
What?!

135
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,210
?
I'm trying to determine whether crying

136
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,930
Infants above my head are a possibility.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,370
I have no immediate plans.

138
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,270
If that changes, let me know.

139
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,970
And finally, area rugs, pro or con?

140
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,600
-  -
Pro? alicia?

141
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,700
-  -
Yes? welcome to the building.

142
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,700
Thanks so much for helping me, leonard.

143
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,800
?
Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.

144
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,070
Oh, hey, guys.

145
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,030
Hey, penny. this is alicia, our new neighbor.

146
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,770
Hi.

147
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,770
Hi.

148
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,530
I'm helping.

149
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,370
I can see.

150
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,500
?
Alicia's non-musical, childless and pro-rug.

151
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,930
She's still on probation, of course, but I like her.

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,370
T
Cool t-shirt.

153
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,900
Oh, yeah, I don't usually dress like this.

154
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,100
I'm going jogging.

155
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,030
You don't jog.

156
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,970
I can start.

157
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,750
?
True

158
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,180
But the more likely explanation for your

159
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,630
Attire is that you're out of clean clothes again.

160
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,470
Thank you, sheldon.

161
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,100
You're welcome, penny.

162
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,430
Please, you look cute.

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,530
?
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

164
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,500
I think you look fantastic.

165
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,970
This one's a player, huh?

166
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,370
Oh, yeah, be careful.

167
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,100
Thanks for the warning. okay.

168
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,370
-  -
-I'll see you around. -see ya.

169
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,070
?
I'm dressed like a slob today, too.

170
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,030
Oh, mimicry.

171
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,570
I enjoy mimicry.

172
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,600
I've been working on admiral ackbar from return of the jedi.

173
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,870
""
"it's a trap."

174
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,200
You have to imagine me with a giant squid head.

175
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
""
"it's a trap."

176
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,400
""

177
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,370
""

178
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,000
Come.

179
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,900
Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.

180
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,430
-    -
-Well, sort of. -how does one "sort of..."

181
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,530
I bought new clothes, okay?

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,300
Is leonard around?

183
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,900
He's upstairs at Alicia's.

184
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,530
?
Oh. all right, that's cool, no biggie.

185
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,070
?
He said he'd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait.

186
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,600
?
What exactly is he doing up there?

187
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,170
In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me,

188
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,730
He is with wolowitz and koothrappali setting up her stereo.

189
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,070
Oh, they're all up there, huh?

190
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,270
Hmm, typical.

191
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,600
It's axiomatically atypical.

192
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,550
Up until recently, they did not know alicia,

193
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,070
And had no encounters with her in a previous location.

194
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,180
They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants,

195
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,430
So your characterization of their behavior as "typical"

196
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,130
Is demonstrably fallacious.

197
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,430
Okay, now I see the giant squid head.

198
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,700
Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again.

199
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,400
Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment,

200
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,260
But I'm really more of a

201
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,130
"downtown loft" kind of guy.

202
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,130
Cool. so are you in a loft now?

203
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh, actually,

204
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,070
I'm, uh, living with a woman in altadena.

205
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,700
Purely platonic. she's also my maid.

206
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,500
Sounds like a sweet deal.

207
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,000
I won't lie. it's pretty dope.

208
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,570
Hello?

209
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,500
Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.

210
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,100
That is so sweet.

211
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,230
Come on in. let's open it. great.

212
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
Nice dress.

213
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,570
?
Oh, this? I'm dressed like a slob today.

214
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,600
The guys have been helping me set up my sound system.

215
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,300
I've never had such good-looking technical support.

216
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,100
Oh, pish-posh.

217
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,300
I don't know, it means shucks.

218
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,870
"shucks" means shucks.

219
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,970
?
Let one go once in a while.

220
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,300
-  ?  -
-Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?  -Yeah.

221
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,570
Alicia is an actress, just like you.

222
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,730
That is so awesome.

223
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,830
Well, trying to be, but it's so hard.

224
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,200
Yeah, I know, tell me about it.

225
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,560
I've been out here three months,

226
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,610
And all I've gotten is a couple of national commercials

227
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,670
And this recurring thing on a soap.

228
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,130
That's why I work at the cheesecake factory.

229
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,100
I'm holding out for the right part.

230
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,040
?DVD
Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for dvds

231
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,870
5.1
5.1 dolby or dts?

232
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,500
Whatever you think is best, cutie.

233
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,370
...
Well, dts has more low end, so...

234
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,670
Okay.

235
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,500
?
Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this.

236
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,370
I read the best science joke on the internet.

237
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,600
Alicia, you won't get it, but it's right up their alley.

238
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,170
Anyway, so,

239
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,040
This physicist goes into an ice cream parlor

240
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,920
every week and orders an ice

241
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,180
Cream sundae for himself, and then offers one

242
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,330
?
To the empty stool sitting next to him.

243
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,820
This goes on for a while

244
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,370
Until the owner finally asks him what he's doing.

245
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,400
The man says, "well, I'm a physicist,

246
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,380
and quantum mechanics...

247
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,940
Teaches us "that it is possible

248
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,700
For the matter above this stool "to

249
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,950
Spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman

250
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,830
MM
Who might accept my offer and fall in love with me."

251
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,600
The owner then says, "well, lots of single,

252
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,270
MM
"beautiful women come in here ever day.

253
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,400
"why don't you buy an ice cream for one of them,

254
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,170
And they might fall in love with you?"

255
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,300
And the physicist says, "yeah, but what

256
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,370
?
are the odds of that happening?"

257
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,870
It's a little insulting, don't you think?

258
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,170
How would I know?

259
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,230
I'm not even sure I get it.

260
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,900
Hey, leonard?

261
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,770
DVD
If you're done with the dvd player,

262
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,570
can you set up my printer?

263
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,070
Uh, yeah, I'd love to.

264
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,910
Uh, hey, maybe when you're done with her printer,

265
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:22,430
You could set up mine.

266
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,930
...
You know, like you promised... a week ago.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,930
Yeah, I'll get to it-- don't nag me.

268
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,750
Hello there

269
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,900
Who is it?

270
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh hello, penny.

271
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,400
It's open-- come in.

272
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,430
Sarcasm.

273
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,370
Well, they're all still up there.

274
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,070
You think I can't hear them?

275
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,400
Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp.

276
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,070
That's wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.

277
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,070
I don't even know why I care.

278
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,200
I don't care.

279
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,100
All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke,

280
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,370
But that's all I care.

281
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,420
You know, penny,

282
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,800
There's something that

283
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,130
Occurs in beehives you might find interesting.

284
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,040
Occasionally,

285
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,530
A new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power.

286
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,960
When this happens,

287
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,960
The old queen must either locate to a new hive or

288
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,030
?
Engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.

289
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,970
?
What are you saying, that I'm threatened by alicia?

290
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,840
That I'm like the old queen of the hive

291
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,500
And it's just time for me to go?

292
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,270
I'm just talking about bees.

293
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,330
They're on the discovery channel.

294
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,830
What are you talking about?

295
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,430
Bees.

296
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,870
I just got that physicist joke.

297
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,100
Gee, penny, thanks for buying us dinner.

298
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,370
Yeah, what's the occasion?

299
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,530
No, no occasion-- just felt like getting

300
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,630
some chinese chow for my peeps.

301
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,070
Did you remember to ask for the chicken

302
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,460
With broccoli to be diced,

303
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,300
-  -
Not shredded?  Yes.

304
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,900
-?  -
Even though the menu description specifies shredded?  Yes.

305
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,370
-    -
Brown rice, not white? Yes.

306
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,930
-
You stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?

307
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,330
Yes.

308
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:30,930
-
did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market? yes.

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,930
Good.

310
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,000
See how it's done, leonard?

311
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,770
So, what do we got going on tonight, huh?

312
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,170
Playing halo watching battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?

313
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,630
You want to watch battlestar?

314
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,300
?
What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.

315
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,600
?
No, no, pms is different.

316
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,970
-    -
Oh, thank god you're home. I need help. what's wrong?

317
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,610
?
I just got a callback to audition

318
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,630
?<>?
For csi to play a hooker who gets killed.

319
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Oh, I'd watch that.

320
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,010
But my car is in the shop,

321
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,100
Okay, well, I'll take you.

322
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,200
Oh, you're a lifesaver.

323
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,500
I'll run lines with you in the car.

324
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,630
Great.

325
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,470
And afterward, I'll take you all out for chinese.

326
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,130
...
Oh, actually, that's okay. we already have...

327
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,530
?
Yum. starving.

328
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,470
...chinese food right here.

329
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,930
They're gone, penny.

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,670
They can't hear you.

331
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,800
I cannot believe they're letting her just use them like that.

332
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,570
I mean, anything she wants,

333
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,170
?
They go panting after her like trained dogs.

334
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,400
You know that just last week,

335
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,080
She had howard drive all the way to her

336
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,230
Uncle's house in orange county to pick up her tv?

337
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,600
?
You once had leonard and me

338
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,870
Get your television from your ex-boyfriend.

339
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,530
Apples and oranges here, sheldon.

340
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,940
That girl is a user

341
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,120
?
iceskating through the life on her looks,

342
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,940
Taking advantage of innocent,

343
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,970
?
Weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows.

344
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,030
?
It just creams my corn.

345
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,870
-  -!
May I interject something here? please.

346
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,700
You got the wrong mustard.

347
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,000
<>
Guess what? I got the part on csi.

348
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,930
?
Oh, boy.

349
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,530
Something wrong?

350
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,900
Uh, no. no, no, no, you know, congratulations.

351
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:32,900
I think you'll make a great hooker.

352
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,700
Thank you.

353
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,270
Hey, I got to ask you something.

354
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,130
How much do physicists make?

355
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,770
Um, I don't know.

356
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,230
I don't think a lot.

357
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,070
Yeah, that's what I figured.

358
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, got to run.

359
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,540
The guys promised to set up my satellite dish

360
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,130
And paint my bedroom. yay!

361
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,300
Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?

362
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,570
About what?

363
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,560
Well, you know, it's just that leonard and howard and raj,

364
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,630
They aren't like other guys.

365
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,500
They're special.

366
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,630
Okay, they're special... and?

367
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,170
Oh, let's see. how can I explain this?

368
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,570
Um, they don't know how to use their shields.

369
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,930
Shields?

370
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,340
Yeah, you know, like in star trek,

371
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,370
When you're in battle and you raise the shields?

372
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,500
Where the hell'd that come from?

373
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,600
...
Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so...

374
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,100
Please don't take advantage of them.

375
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,400
Who says I'm taking advantage of them?

376
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,690
Come on. they're doing everytng for you,

377
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,070
Because you're leading them on.

378
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,130
So I let them do stuff for me.

379
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,870
They're happy. I get stuff.

380
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,130
Who cares?

381
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,000
?
And how's it any different from what you do?

382
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,570
Excuse me?

383
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,070
I've seen you around them.

384
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,530
?
Are you pretending like you don't do the exact same thing?

385
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,100
Okay, lady, you are way out of line.

386
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,900
Oh, I'm out of line?

387
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,900
?
Yeah, you're out of line.

388
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,500
Well, what are you going to do about it...

389
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,130
Bitch?

390
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,200
I like green lantern.

391
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,220
I'm just saying it's pretty lame that

392
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,330
He can be defeated by the color yellow.

393
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.

394
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,670
Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.

395
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,630
2B
Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?

396
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,200
!
Oh, my god! girl fight!

397
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,530
What are you doing?!

398
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,170
I know you. you're stupid enough to break it up.

399
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,300
May I say you look very comely tonight?

400
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,970
Thank you.

401
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,430
You're right, this filly's been broken.

402
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,970
you set it on dts, didn't you?

403
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,330
I had to.

404
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,430
She called me "cutie."

405
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,000
According to alicia's facebook page,

406
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,230
CSI
She's hooking up with one of the producers on csi.

407
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,270
Well, dead whore on tv, live one in real life.

408
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,430
Oh, great.

409
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,270
Now she's jumping up and down on the bed.
