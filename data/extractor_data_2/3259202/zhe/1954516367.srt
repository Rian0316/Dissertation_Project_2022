1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:02,930
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
REBEKAH: Previously on
The Originals...

2
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:06,302
我们的社区正遭受攻击
Our community is under attack.

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:07,667
她们是在向我们宣战
They're declaring war on us.

4
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:09,672
他这一生只真正害怕过
All his life,
there has only ever been one man

5
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,471
一个人，我的父亲麦可
he has truly feared.
My father, Mikael.

6
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:14,580
我们只需要一个能帮我们找到他的女巫
All we need is a witch
who can help us find him.

7
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,443
- 莎莉丝特
- 你怎么发现的？
-Celeste.
-How did you know?

8
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:17,675
如果你是来报仇的…
If you have come here
seeking revenge, don't--

9
00:00:17,817 --> 00:00:20,752
仇我一定会报
从克劳斯开始
Oh, I'll have my revenge.
Starting with Klaus.

10
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,788
他会尝到前所未有的痛苦和折磨
He is gonna know pain and torment
like he's never felt before.

11
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:27,256
然后就剩下蕾贝卡
你悲惨的妹妹
Then that leaves Rebekah,
the tragic sister.

12
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,726
她马上就会发现自己深陷窘境
She's about to find herself
in quite the predicament.

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,763
洁妮薇知道你妹妹在哪
Genevieve knows
where your sister is.

14
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:34,594
贝丝蒂娜把克劳斯
藏在一个安全的地方
Bastianna has Klaus
tucked away someplace safe.

15
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:36,895
我想“永远”终究不会是永恒
I guess always isn't forever,
after all.

16
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,326
谁在那里？
Who's there?

17
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,936
我怎么会在这里？
How the hell did I get here?

18
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:39,717
- 洁妮薇
- 蕾卡贝
-Genevieve.
-Rebekah.

19
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:43,625
这么快就要走了吗？
我们还没好好叙叙旧呢
Tell me you're not leaving, already.
I thought we might reminisce.

My siblings have been taken.
Where are they?

27
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,121
你打断了我苏菲阿姨的献祭仪式
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
You're interrupting
my Aunt Sophie's consecration.

28
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,095
- 她怎么死的？
- 苏菲阿姨是战争的牺牲品
-How did this happen?
-Aunt Sophie was a casualty of war.

29
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,900
莫妮克，我建议你给我我想要的
Monique, I recommend you give me
what I want

30
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,031
除非你希望我把这里
unless, of course,
you'd like me to level this place

31
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,302
夷为平地
and everything in it.

32
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,038
没这个必要
制片：克里斯多福贺利尔
That won't be necessary.

33
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,646
我有个消息给你
制片：兰斯安德森
I have a message for you.

34
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,944
是来自莎莉丝特的
From Celeste.

35
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:32,401
若想找到你要找的
跟随她留下的线索
To find what you're looking for,
follow the path she left behind.

36
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,076
制片：邦妮怀斯

37
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,665
你到底想干嘛，冷血的贱人？
编剧：艾胥莉莱尔，巴特尼克森
What the hell are you doing,
you ruthless bitch?

38
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,299
导演：麦特海斯廷

39
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,711
可怜的蕾贝卡
你应该好好休息
Poor Rebekah.
You should rest.

40
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,711
你看起来有些憔悴
You're looking a little piqued.

41
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,882
不过这也难免
Of course, that's to be expected,

42
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,253
毕竟你的体内有着不少的狼人毒液
given the rather impressive amount
of werewolf venom in your system.

43
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,294
顺便问问，你对那个
狼人小伙子还中意吗？
How did you like that wolf-boy,
by the way?

44
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
我想他应该是你喜欢的类型
放荡低俗，千依百顺
I thought he seemed like your type.
Trashy and willing.

45
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,127
如果不是我太虚弱了
我一定会把你的头拧下来
If I weren't so bloody sick,
I'd rip your head off.

46
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,964
但你确实病了
But you are sick.

47
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,870
而照顾病人正是我的长处
And comforting the sick
always was a talent of mine.

48
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,809
我会照顾我的朋友
I take care of my friends.

49
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,973
我们曾是朋友，不是吗？
We were friends, weren't we?

50
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,078
我们当然是
Of course we were.

51
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,278
我们曾是朋友，不是吗？
(ECHOlNG) We were friends,
weren't we?

52
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,016
(1919年 纽奥良）

53
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,883
没事，没事
There, there.

54
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,426
身份不明的病人
Unidentified sick man.

55
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,634
这看起来可不妙
That can't be good.

56
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,902
你，红发女
You, Red.

57
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,905
来，喝点这个
Here.
Try to take a sip of this.

58
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,083
就跟魔法一样
Just like magic.

59
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,088
但话说回来，一个女巫施的
But then, again,
what would you expect

60
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,988
不是魔法还是什么呢？
from a practicing witch?

61
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,829
这只是简单的草药疗法
It's a simple, herbal remedy.

62
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,829
虽然不能阻止死亡
Won't stop the inevitable

63
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,696
但至少能减轻他的痛苦和肺部的负担
but it should ease his pain
and quiet his lungs.

64
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,166
应该能管用一阵子
For a while, at least.

65
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,761
这份工作你真拿手…
你叫什么名字来着？
You're quite good at this, Miss--
What was your name, again?

66
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,035
- 洁妮薇
- 真好听
-Genevieve.
-Lovely.

67
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,873
或许你可以给我一些指点
Perhaps you could give me
some pointers.

68
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,005
当然没问题，但我有点不明白
Certainly.
Though it is a bit odd.

69
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,143
一个吸血鬼来当护士
A vampire, serving as nurse.

70
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,949
拜托，亲爱的，我是个吸血鬼真祖
Please, darling,
I'm an Original vampire.

71
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,558
如果我的城市遭受严重的流感
If my city is under attack
from this nasty influenza,

72
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,284
我有责任伸出援手
it is my duty to lend a hand.

73
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,865
再说，要是人都死光了
那我吃什么呢？
Besides, if this entire lot dies,
who'd be left to eat?

74
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,629
你可真淘气
You're wicked.

75
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,728
我觉得我们俩会成为好朋友的
You know, I think you and l
are going to be fast friends.

76
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,399
今晚你跟我一起去一间
超赞的爵士乐酒吧如何？
What say, you join me at this swell,
little jazz joint

77
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,010
我在贝森街上发现的
I've discovered
on Basin Street tonight?

78
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,975
我们可以为纽奥良的健康干杯
We can toast to the health
of New Orleans.

79
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,981
我不确定
Oh, I don't know.

80
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:38,847
你，你也来吧
You, you should come too.

81
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,959
扮演了一整天的白衣天使
After playing angels of mercy
all day,

82
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,994
我们都应该开心一下
I'd say we all deserve some fun.

83
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,272
有何发现？
Anything?

84
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:07,181
他们四处散布眼线
They're putting eyes
and ears out everywhere.

85
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,254
日行者在跟我们的每一个线人接触
Daywalkers are working
every contact we got.

86
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,516
警察、码头工人、郊区的人
已经放话出去了
Cops, dock-workers,
guys in the Treme. Word is out.

87
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,853
任何想要讨好我的人
一旦找到他们
Anyone trying to earn favor with me
gets a lifetime of it,

88
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,394
- 就能得我青睐一辈子
- 很好，给我笔和纸
-if they find them.
-Good. I need a pen and paper.

89
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,625
嘿，我现在是听你差遣了吗？
Hey.
Am I taking orders from you, now?

90
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,360
还是说我们该携手解决呢？
Or are we in this together?

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,769
给我笔和纸，马赛尔，立刻
Pen and paper, Marcellus. Now.

92
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,035
我跟你一样迫切希望能找到她
I want her back
just as much as you do, you know.

93
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,769
找到他们两个
Both of them.

94
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,243
- 海莉
- 以利亚，你回来了
-Hayley?
-Elijah. You're back.

95
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:43,878
有什么发…现吗？
Did you find anything?

96
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:48,048
怎么回事？
What is happening?

97
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,255
我要你把这些名字列个清单
拜托了
I need you to make a list
of these names. Please.

98
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,402
好的
Okay.

99
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,550
“莎宾”
以利亚，这是什么？
"Sabine."
Elijah, what is this?

100
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,450
我觉得这些应该是
I believe they represent the names

101
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,285
过去两百年里
莎莉丝特寄身的女人的名字
of women Celeste inhabited
for the past two centuries.

102
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,121
这叫做猜谜
是种传统游戏，有点类似谜语
It's called the devinette.
It's old-school, kind of a riddle.

103
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,024
女巫用这个方法教孩子
Witches use them
to teach their kids.

104
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,630
解开谜语，文字便会消失
Solve it and it disappears.

105
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,131
为什么？这么做有什么意义？
Why? What's the point?

106
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,792
莎莉丝特强迫我
在你和我的弟妹之间做出选择
Celeste forced me to make a choice
between yourself and my siblings

107
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:32,427
现在她要嘲笑我的选择
and now, she means to mock
that choice,

108
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,097
用一个小孩子的游戏嘲讽我
taunting me with a childish game.

109
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,005
游戏时间越长，他们受越多苦
The longer the game,
the more they suffer.

110
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,545
要找到尼克劳斯和蕾贝卡
我们得解开这个谜
So, to find Niklaus and Rebekah,
we need to solve this riddle.

111
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,375
谜底就在这些名字里
The solution lies
somewhere in these names.

112
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,509
莎宾旁边的名字“安妮拉福勒”
The name next to Sabine,
"Annie LaFleur."

113
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,550
她是个女巫，在一年多以前
被族群孤立
She's a witch that was shunned
from her coven just over a year ago.

114
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,352
不知道什么原因，但我会查明
I never knew why
but I can find out.

115
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,207
可怜的东西
GENEVlEVE: You poor thing.

116
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,756
别担心，我是来帮你的
Don't worry.
I'm here to help.

117
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,183
安妮是个好女孩
MAN: Annie was a good girl.

118
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,518
女巫们冤枉她了，不该那样孤立她
Witches done her wrong,
shunning her like that.

119
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,719
她们说安妮使用黑魔法
这绝不可能
Saying that she's doing dark magic.
There's no way.

120
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,591
但她们有证据
They had proof.

121
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,697
所以她了结了自己
So she just quit.

122
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,797
我实在是不能因此责备她
I can't really blame her for that.

123
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,803
因为一旦你被孤立
Because once you've been shunned,

124
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,033
那还有什么理由继续活下去呢，对吧？
what's the point of going on?
You know?

125
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,403
- 她自杀了？
- 对
-She killed herself?
-ELlJAH: Yes.

126
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,913
确切地说，她投入了密西西比河
Drowned herself in the Mississippi
to be precise.

127
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,210
很显然，莎莉丝特厌倦了那副身躯
Celeste had clearly tired
of the body

128
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,750
并已准备寄身莎宾
and was ready to take Sabine's.

129
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,183
你怎么知道？
How do you know that?

130
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,481
她跳河自杀的地方
She leapt to her death
from the very location

131
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,318
就是我跟莎莉丝特初吻的地方
Celeste and I had our first kiss.

132
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,791
真够诗意的，用这种恐怖的
复仇性的方式
Poetic, I guess,
in a creepy, vendetta kind of way.

133
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,919
那些名字，那些生命
All these names,
these lives, stolen,

134
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,793
莎莉丝特偷走它们就为了复仇
that Celeste might take her revenge.

135
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,730
我们似乎别无选择
只能继续追查
I suppose we have no choice
but to see where they take us.

136
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,460
海莉，我先挂了，回头打给你
Hayley, I have to go.
I'll call you back.

137
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:47,504
- 以利亚，等等
- 怎么了？
-Elijah, wait.
-What is it?

138
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,906
问问马赛尔知不知道名单上的一个人
Ask Marcel if he knows anything
about a name on that list.

139
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,105
布琳德弗罗
Brynne Deveraux.

140
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,307
苏菲说对新月狼族下诅咒的
Sophie said that it was
her family's bloodline

141
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,316
是她家族里的一个成员
that put the curse
on the Crescent Wolves

142
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,921
但莎莉丝特说只有她能够破解
but Celeste said that she was
the only one that could break it.

143
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,818
如果布琳德弗罗下咒的时候
If Brynne Deveraux
was actually Celeste,

144
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,791
其实是莎莉丝特
那么也许莎莉丝特能够解除
when she cast the spell, then,
maybe Celeste can still break it.

145
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,691
我问问他吧
I'll see what he knows.

146
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,957
以利亚
Elijah?

147
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:16,091
我很抱歉让你经历这些事
I'm really sorry
that you're going through this.

148
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:19,693
要是我知道莎莉丝特会逼你选择救谁…
If I'd known that Celeste
had made you choose who to help--

149
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,136
你会葬身火海的，海莉
You were going to die in that fire,
Hayley,

150
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,333
我弟弟的孩子也一样
along with my brother's child.

151
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,104
我别无选择
There was no choice.

152
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,677
我的伤口没有自愈
My wound isn't healing.

153
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,880
那把刀里有着很强大的黑魔法
The amount of dark magic
contained in that blade,

154
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,388
完全恢复需要一段时间
it's gonna take a little while.

155
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,119
你也是其中一员吧？
You're one of them, aren't you?

156
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:46,561
死而复生的女巫
想要复仇
The witches back from the dead,
seeking vengeance.

157
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,792
为什么对我仁慈？
Why show me kindness?

158
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,402
你没有伤害过我
You never did anything to me.

159
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,271
而且，看到你这样
And the truth is,
seeing you like this,

160
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,002
我不由得同情你
I can't help but pity you.

161
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,479
那就背叛其他人站到我这边吧
Well, then, betray the others
and stand with me.

162
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:09,987
我会给你
你无法想像的丰厚报酬
I will reward you
in ways you cannot possibly fathom.

163
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:15,891
克劳斯米卡森居然要求跟我做交易？
Klaus Mikaelson offering a deal
to little, old me?

164
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:18,496
我真是受宠若惊啊
I should be flattered.

165
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:24,934
不过…
我们得先聊聊你妹妹的事
But first, we need to have a talk
about your sister.

166
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,670
蕾贝卡跟你没关系
如果你敢伤害她…
Rebekah is of no concern to you.
If you mean to harm her...

167
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,108
你这哥哥对她可真好
(GROANS)
The protective brother.

168
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,271
真遗憾，她对你可不那么忠诚
Shame that loyalty
isn't reciprocated.

169
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:39,578
不过，我也许没资格评判她
But then, I'm no stranger
to Rebekah's treachery.

170
00:13:40,953 --> 00:13:42,944
我们也都曾背叛过别人
Something you and l
have in common.

171
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,951
来，喝了吧
Here. Drink.

172
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,695
我是想帮你
治好你
I'm just trying to help you.
Heal you.

173
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,131
让你看到真相
Get you to see the truth

174
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,964
其实这一百年来，真相一直在你眼前
that's been right in front of you
for almost a century.

175
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,951
你妹妹昨晚和一群狼
Your sister had
an unfortunate run-in

176
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,075
发生了惨烈的冲突
with some wolves, last night.

177
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,121
我想你尝到她血中的毒液了
I imagine you're tasting the venom
in her blood.

178
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,453
只有这样我才能让你看到
你应该看到的真相
It's the only way I can show you
what you need to see.

179
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,328
在她虚弱的时候
In her weakened state,

180
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:32,403
我才能帮她回忆往事
I'll be able to guide her
down Memory Lane.

181
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,233
这就是我复仇的方式
That's how I'm gonna have
my revenge.

182
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,672
让你看看她的背叛
By showing you her betrayal.

183
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,246
尼克劳斯
Niklaus.

184
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,340
马赛尔，放尊重点
Marcel.
Have some respect.

185
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,281
他们应该不会介意
Yeah, I don't think they mind.

186
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,658
你跟洁妮薇谈施咒的事了吗？
Did you ask Genevieve
about doing the spell?

187
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:32,093
我会的，现在时机未到
I will.
When the time is right.

188
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,791
蕾贝卡
几周来，你一直在那女巫身边转
Rebekah. You been hanging
around that witch for weeks

189
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,095
等待着合适时机
waiting for the time to be right.

190
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,466
她不应该成为你的朋友
She wasn't supposed
to become your sidekick.

191
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:43,707
只要一个咒语，我们就能真正
One little spell
and we could finally be together,

192
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,139
在一起了
for real.

193
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,540
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

194
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,376
她是个好女孩，就这样
She's a sweet girl, is all.

195
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,882
你非要弄个明白
其实利用她令我很难受
If you must know,
I feel badly for using her.

196
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,383
那我们就再找别的女巫
Then, we'll find another witch.

197
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,420
一个用不着你跟她假装友好的
One you don't have to fake
a friendship with.

198
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,691
除非你改变主意了
Unless you changed your mind.

199
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,229
我想我们有自己的家，同床共枕
I want to wake up with you
in our home,

200
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,767
醒来有你在身边
in the bed that we share.

201
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,667
我想和你一起散步
I want to walk down the street
with you by my side

202
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,401
让所有人都知道，你是我的
我是你的
so that everyone knows
that you are mine and I am yours.

203
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,532
我不想因为爱你而活在
I don't want to be afraid

204
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,542
担心哥哥怎么对付我的惶恐中
of what my brother will do to me
for loving you.

205
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,172
如果这是唯一的一办法，那么…
If this is the only way to get it, then...

206
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,552
我不会改变心意
No, my mind hasn't changed.

207
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,406
我不知道有人在这里
真对不起
I didn't know anyone was in here,
I'm so sorry.

208
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,131
洁妮薇
Genevieve.

209
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,105
洁妮薇，等等
Genevieve, wait.

210
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,583
对不起
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:05,155
这就是你说的背叛啊
So, this is your great betrayal?

212
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,258
我妹妹和马赛尔
My sister and Marcel,

213
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,156
他们背着我偷偷摸摸
they've been sneaking around
behind my back

214
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,762
在一起厮混了两百年
for the better part
of two centuries.

215
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,128
是的，全然无视你的警告
Yes.
Against all your warnings.

216
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,600
你曾为此教训过他们
不是吗？
You'd disciplined them for it, before,
had you not?

217
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,500
一定很严厉，我明白
Harshly, I understand.

218
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,098
- 我有我的理由
- 你不需要说服我
-I have my reasons.
-Oh, you don't have to convince me.

219
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:31,416
依我看
你只需要一个理由
As far as I'm concerned,
you only needed one.

220
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,812
就是对你有好处
That it suited you.

221
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,655
你读过“旧约”吗，尼克？
Have you ever read
the Old Testament, Nik?

222
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,359
你瞧
You see...

223
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:45,952
上帝不是因为有道理才强大
...God wasn't powerful
because he was right.

224
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,802
而是因为强大才有道理
He was right
because he was powerful.

225
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,303
我不知道你在玩什么花样
I don't know what you're playing at.

226
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,672
但如果让我和我妹反目
But if the sum total of your plan
to turn me against my sister

227
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,335
是你整个计划的目的
was this revelation,

228
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,175
那你就白费力气了
this will have been
a wholly ineffective endeavor.

229
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,976
可怜的家伙
You poor thing.

230
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:06,982
一千年过去了
After a thousand years,

231
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,452
你们家族的虚伪本性依旧
dishonesty from your family
has come to be expected.

232
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:15,617
我倒希望他们的背叛行为不过如此
I wish that was the sum total
of their treachery.

233
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,695
不幸的是，不止如此
Unfortunately, it's not.

234
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,376
你想要我怎么样？
(STAMMERlNG) What do
you want from me?

235
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:41,082
我想你对这猪圈很熟悉吧
Well, I assume you're familiar
with this pigsty.

236
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,984
被称为“坑”真是再合适不过
Quite appropriately known
as "The Pit."

237
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,251
是这样，很不巧的
几周前
See, awkwardly enough,
only weeks ago,

238
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,189
有一群像你这样的人类
a group of human beings,
just like yourself,

239
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,455
杀了许多现在站在你面前的
slaughtered many of the companions
of the vampires

240
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:54,657
吸血鬼的同伴
that you see assembled
before you here.

241
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,132
你在市政厅掌管档案室
You run the records room
at City Hall.

242
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,032
听说前任市长有一份关于
We're told the former mayor
kept a detailed record

243
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,162
超自然群体的详细记录
of the supernatural community.

244
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,570
一份列有女巫、狼人和吸血鬼的名单
A ledger of names of witches,
werewolves and vampires,

245
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,406
确切说，是他们的死亡名单
specifically, their death records.

246
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,943
我们需要它
We need it.

247
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,705
我不知道它在哪里
I don't know where it is.

248
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,976
我想大家都知道这是唬人的
你们有谁饿了吗？
I think we both know that's a fib.
Anyone feeling hungry?

249
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,051
好吧，好吧，等一下
(VAMPlRES SNARLlNG)
Okay, okay, wait.

250
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,457
市长死后，他们就把档案转移了
They moved the records
after the mayor died.

251
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,590
存放在圣安妮教堂的圣器室里
They're at the sacristy
of Saint Anne's Church.

252
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,594
瞧
You see?

253
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,599
乖
There.

254
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,369
也没多难，对吧？
Wasn't so difficult now, was it?

255
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,587
很不顺的一天？
Rough day?

256
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,755
瞧你，小贝卡
你的伤口看起来好吓人
Oh, Beks.
Those bites are looking nasty.

257
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,669
为什么要让我回到过去？
我们都知道结局如何
Why make me relive the past?
We both know how it ends.

258
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,498
你和我知道
You and I both know.

259
00:20:06,638 --> 00:20:08,606
但我想你哥哥应该会想知道我们的故事
But I thought your brother
might like to hear our story.

260
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:14,101
所以我把你们俩的意识连结起来了
你自己会告诉他一切的
So I linked your mind to his.
You're gonna show him everything.

261
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,807
不，别这样对我，我什么都答应你
No. No, please, don't do that to me,
I'll do anything.

262
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,418
太迟了，朋友
It's too late, friend.

263
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:53,441
马赛尔，这里又有一个名单中的名字
布琳德弗罗
Marcel, here's another name
from our list, "Brynne Deveraux"?

264
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,143
这里说她20多年前自己溺水而亡
Says here she drowned herself
some 20 years ago.

265
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:56,447
你认得这名字吗？
Do you recognize the name?

266
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,149
布琳？是啊，我们曾经一起玩过
寻欢作乐什么的
Brynne? Yeah, yeah, we used
to hang out, knock around a bit.

267
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:01,554
细节就不用说了
You can spare me the details,
please.

268
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,161
她那时偶尔为我施一些咒语
She used to do some spells for me
now and then.

269
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:05,524
很厉害的一个女孩
Girl had power.

270
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,421
就因为一个狼群惹了我
Cursed a whole pack
of werewolves

271
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,467
就把他们全部诅咒了
just because
they were pissing me off.

272
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,001
说到这个…
Speaking of...

273
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,502
你认为当克劳斯发现你不顾他受折磨
What do you think Klaus is gonna do

274
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,005
赶去救海莉和她的狼人朋友
once he finds out
that you left him to suffer,

275
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,699
他会是什么反应？
while you saved Hayley
and her wolf friends.

276
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:19,708
与你无关的事我们就别讨论了吧
Let's avoid discussing matters
that are not your concern,

277
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:20,834
好吗，马赛勒斯？
shall we, Marcellus?

278
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:23,174
得了吧，以利亚
这个城市里到处都是我的人
Oh, come on, Elijah.
I got guys all over this city.

279
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:24,680
你真以为我不知道
You honestly think that I don't know

280
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,841
新月族的狼人们昨晚在种植园
that the Crescent Wolves
had a little family reunion

281
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,681
举行了家庭聚会吗？
out at the plantation last night?

282
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,915
顺便谢谢你让那房子烧毁了
也算是个解脱
Thanks for letting the house burn,
by the way. Good riddance.

283
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,085
但我要问的是
海莉为什么会和那些人在一起？
But my question is:
What's Hayley doing with that bunch?

284
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,924
马赛尔，我知道你之前
与这里的狼群不合
Marcel, I'm aware of your history
with this city's wolves

285
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,124
我也希望你明白
如果你敢打海莉的主意
and I assume you understand that
if you lay a finger upon Hayley,

286
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:44,167
那将成为你在这世上的绝响
it will be the last thing you do
on this Earth.

287
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,033
好，看来我触碰到禁区了
Okay. I see I hit a nerve.

288
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,533
我还以为我们相处得不错呢
And just when we were getting along.

289
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,838
我们猜对了
We were right.

290
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,072
我身上的每一个名字
都是死于自杀的女巫
Every name upon my flesh
signifies a witch who died

291
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,705
除了一个人
by her own hand, all but one.

292
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,249
克莱拉桑莫林
"Clara Summerlin."

293
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,882
- 有印象吗？
- 没有
-Ring any bells?
-None.

294
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,252
好吧
如果她不是死于自杀
Okay, well,
if she didn't off herself,

295
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:09,952
- 那是怎么死的呢？
- 流感，1919年的流行病
-then how'd she die?
-lnfluenza. Epidemic of 1919.

296
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,306
看来我们找到答案了
I suppose we have our answer.

297
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,781
只是不知道这答案的含义
Only I have no idea what it means.

298
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,910
不要，拜托
(GASPS)
Please.

299
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:17,527
你妹妹与马赛尔的私会仅仅是个开始
Your sister's tryst with Marcel
was only the beginning.

300
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:20,859
你看，你身上背负的谴责
You see,
the burden of your condemnation

301
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,489
太多了
had become too great.

302
00:23:22,634 --> 00:23:25,034
因此，你内心最深的恐惧成为了现实
And as a result,
your deepest fear came to pass.

303
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,833
那就是他们对彼此的爱
远远超过了他们对你的爱
That their love for each other
would overshadow their love for you.

304
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,602
还转化成为恨
Turn it into hate.

305
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,305
尼克，他们密谋永远摆脱掉你
Nik, they conspired
to rid themselves of you for good.

306
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,788
你绝对不是
You're anything but.

307
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,361
好，下一轮我请
Okay, next round's on me.

308
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,870
克莱拉桑莫林，不要啦
我会醉的
Clara Summerlin, no.
I'll be soused.

309
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:04,635
能喝就喝吧，这可是城里仅剩的美酒了
Get it, while you can,
it's the last real gin in the city.

310
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,306
酒保
Bartender?

311
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,713
你和我初次见你时想像的
You're nothing like
I thought you'd be

312
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:17,549
一点都不像
when I first met you.

313
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,247
从小我就被教导，你们这种生物都是…
I was brought up
to think your kind were--

314
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,685
- 那个…
- 天生的怪物吗？
-Well...
-An abomination of nature?

315
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,427
你绝对不是
You're anything but.

316
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,159
不只是你，你全家都很…
Not just you,
your whole family is so...

317
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,931
优雅
...elegant.

318
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,540
是啊，我同意，以利亚确实无可挑剔
Yes, I agree,
Elijah is quite peerless.

319
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:38,802
我不知道，我是说，他很好，但是…
I don't know, I mean,
he's nice and all.

320
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:42,436
如果只能让我选一个米卡森家的男人…
But if I had to go
for one Mikaelson boy.

321
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,083
克劳斯？
Klaus?

322
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,244
洁妮薇，谁会想到
像你这样圣洁的小女巫
Genevieve, who would've thought
a saintly, little witch like you

323
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,547
会喜欢坏小子呢？
would go for the bad boys?

324
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,582
我就知道我们一定会成为朋友
I knew
we were destined to be friends.

325
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,757
麻烦给我马丁尼
Martini, please.

326
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,729
别动，拜托
Don't move. Please.

327
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,368
让我来吧
Allow me.

328
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,343
留着吧，送你了
Keep it.
It's yours.

329
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,749
米卡森家有很多人呢
Well,
there's a load of us Mikaelsons.

330
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:22,649
如果你喜欢坏小子
你一定会喜欢我哥哥柯尔
If you like bad boys,
you'd love my brother, Kol.

331
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,456
那你这位神秘的哥哥在哪呢？
And where is this mystery brother
of yours?

332
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,186
一言难尽
It's complicated.

333
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,559
正如其他兄弟姊妹一样
我们也起起落落的
Like all siblings,
we've had our ups and downs.

334
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,790
家族争斗
Family feuds.

335
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,903
事实上，我正在考虑
In fact,
I was thinking of reaching out

336
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,598
要去联络一个很久没见的人
to someone we haven't seen
in a very long while.

337
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,573
我希望也许你能帮我找到他
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me contact them.

338
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:52,308
但一定要保密
不能让任何人知道
But it would have to be a surprise.
No one could know.

339
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,475
当然
Of course.

340
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,280
你是要我找你哥哥柯尔吗？
You want me
to find your brother, Kol?

341
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:03,260
其实我是要你找麦可
我们的父亲
Actually, I'd like you to find Mikael.
Our father.

342
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,627
- 够了，不要再骗人了
- 不要怪送信人
Enough of your lies!
GENEVlEVE: Don't dismember
the messenger.

343
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,429
你内心一定知道
至少怀疑过
Part of you must have known.
Suspected, at least.

344
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,507
你父亲曾在1919年
来到纽奥良要杀你
Your father came
to New Orleans in 1919 to kill you.

345
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,801
是不是？
Did he not?

346
00:26:17,943 --> 00:26:21,606
当城市烧毁时，他差点就成功了
And as the city burned,
he nearly succeeded.

347
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,813
多年来
My family and l

348
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,443
我和我的家人对彼此做了许多可怕的事
have done some terrible things
to each other over the years.

349
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,786
但蕾贝卡绝对不会找我的父亲
But Rebekah
would not call my father.

350
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,689
不管她有多么愤怒
No matter how angry she was.

351
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,298
你能相信这一切，真难得
It's sweet of you to believe that.

352
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,225
如此信任她
To believe in her.

353
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,738
但等到我们结束时
你就会知道你错得多离谱了
But by the time we're done here,
you'll know just how wrong you are.

354
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:03,379
听着，我找到了…
Hey, look, I found--

355
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,052
德弗罗女巫的事你说得没错
You were right
about the Deveraux witch.

356
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,592
找到那个神秘女巫克莱拉的线索了吗？
Find anything about Clara,
the mystery witch?

357
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:10,752
不多
Not much.

358
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,591
她曾是鸢尾花疗养院的护士
She was a nurse
at the Fleur-de-Lis Sanatorium.

359
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,697
认得她吗？
最上排，右边数来第二个
Recognize her?
Top row, second from the right.

360
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,738
不，不认识
No. I don't.

361
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:27,571
马赛尔
马赛尔？
Marcel-- Marcel?

362
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,341
需要我提醒你尼克劳斯和蕾贝卡
Do I need to remind you
that Niklaus and Rebekah

363
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,508
正在某处痛苦煎熬吗？
如果你知道什么…
are somewhere suffering horribly?
If you know something...

364
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,051
快点说
...talk.

365
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,681
疗养院，你可以在那里找到他们
Sanatorium.
That's where you'll find them.

366
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,918
你确定吗？你怎么知道？
You sure?
How do you know?

367
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:44,926
- 我就是知道
- 你怎么知道的？
-I just know.
-How do you know?

368
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,729
如果我没想错
If I'm right...

369
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:57,603
你就得知道我们到底面对的是什么
...you need to know exactly
what we're walking into.

370
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,607
我和蕾贝卡做了一件事
We did something, Rebekah and l.

371
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,144
我觉得女巫们在利用这事对付她
I think the witches
are trying to use it against her.

372
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:11,280
是你不会喜欢的事
It's something
that you're not gonna like.

373
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,058
你准备好看更多证据了吗？
Are you ready to see more proof?

374
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,532
- 你看到什么了？
- 我父亲的刀
-GENEVlEVE: What do you see?
-KLAUS: My father's blade.

375
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,762
我小时候它就不见了
It went missing
when I was a boy.

376
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:04,864
他把我揍得半死
确信是我偷走了它
He beat me half-to-death.
So sure I had stolen it.

377
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,773
我被打之后几周，蕾贝卡对我特别好
Rebekah was so kind to me
in the weeks after the beating

378
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,109
我就该意识到是她干的
I should have known
she was the culprit.

379
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,185
她最不能忍受别人说
女孩子不可以用武器
She never could stand weapons
were things not meant for girls.

380
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,303
不！
No!

381
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,409
我的妹妹
My sister.

382
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,450
蕾贝卡
Rebekah.

383
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:50,679
蕾贝卡！
Rebekah!

384
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,256
大半个世纪，我一直想知道
父亲是如何找到我们的
For the better part of a century,
I have wondered how Father found us.

385
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,382
我们到底是犯了什么愚蠢的错误
What foolish mistake
that we had made,

386
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,721
才毁了那处有着美好回忆
to destroy our time
in the one place

387
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:58,192
我们终于能称之为家的地方
that we could finally call home.

388
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,856
你知道吗
责怪自己
我甚至一度
，马赛勒斯
Do you know, I even blamed myself
for a time, Marcellus.

389
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,870
- 以利亚
- 尼克劳斯把你当儿子一样对待
-Elijah.
-Niklaus treated you like a son.

390
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,498
- 蕾贝卡…
- 我爱她，至今仍爱着她
-And Rebekah--
-I loved her. I still love her.

391
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,042
我们只是想在一起
All we ever wanted
was to be together

392
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,646
但只要克劳斯在
那就绝对不可能
but as long as Klaus was around,
that was never gonna happen.

393
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,876
但是，这些我想你根本不知道吧？
But hey, I guess you wouldn't know
anything about that, huh?

394
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,285
尼克劳斯得知真相后
你能想像他会有多暴怒
When Niklaus learns the truth,
there will be no end to his rage.

395
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:33,363
我不会让我妹妹承受他的怒火
I will not let my sister
suffer that wrath.

396
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:39,736
那我们得在他得知真相前找到他们
Then we need to get to them
before he learns the truth.

397
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:57,316
放弃吧，蕾贝卡
如今这已是不可避免的了
Just give it up, Rebekah.
It's inevitable at this point.

398
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,093
- 莎宾
- 其实我更喜欢莎莉丝特这名字
-Sabine.
-I prefer, Celeste, actually.

399
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:05,696
这些年来我有过很多名字
All these names I've had
over the years

400
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,661
我还是喜欢第一个
and I still prefer the first.

401
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,597
也许是因为我喜欢以利亚念它的感觉吧
Perhaps it was the way it sounded
on Elijah's lips.

402
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,794
就像是爱的宣言
Like a declaration of love.

403
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:17,499
他真是个撒谎高手
你们都是
Oh, he was a good liar.
All of you are.

404
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:20,270
随你怎么说我
但以利亚是个好人
Say what you will about me
but Elijah is a good man.

405
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,847
即使到最后还在为他辫护
Still defending him.
Even until the bitter end.

406
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,280
很好，我就指望着你们的家族亲情呢
Good.
I'm counting on that familial love.

407
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,081
那会毁了你们所有人
It'll be the ruin of you all.

408
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,484
现在克劳斯知道你做的事了
Now that Klaus knows
what you've done,

409
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,421
不复仇成功他是不会停止的
he'll never stop
until he's had his revenge.

410
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,892
他会杀了马赛尔，对你做出可怕的事
He'll kill Marcel
and do something horrible to you.

411
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,860
以利亚绝对不会原谅他
Elijah will never forgive him.

412
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,832
你的背叛最终会让兄弟反目成仇
Your betrayal will ultimately
pit brother against brother.

413
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,698
传说中的米卡森家族将分崩离析
And the fabled "Mikaelson bond"
will crumble.

414
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:49,136
- 我要杀了你，贱人
- 你已经杀过我了
-I'll kill you, you bitch.
-You already did.

415
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,878
不过在那时，我不是这副容貌
Though, at the time,
I wore a different face.

416
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,655
洁妮薇，我们得谈谈
私下谈
Genevieve, we need to talk.
Privately.

417
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:12,388
我可以的，你去吧
反正你也该清洗一下了
I'll be fine here, you go ahead.
You should wash up, anyway.

418
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,626
嘿
尽快把那个烧了
Hey.
Incinerate that as soon as you can.

419
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:23,873
你是另外那个护士，克莱拉
You were the other one.
Clara.

420
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,210
你不该来插手我的事
You should have minded
your own business.

421
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,006
我怀疑我的朋友被利用了
I suspected my friend
was being exploited.

422
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,081
这就是我的事
It was my business.

423
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:32,648
取消咒语，你疯了吗？
"Call it off."
Are you mad?

424
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,808
是我错了
I was wrong.

425
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,218
这太愚蠢，太冲动了
这会毁了我们的，洁妮薇
It was stupid, and impulsive
and it will ruin us, Genevieve.

426
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,018
不只是克劳斯，还有以利亚
Not just Klaus but Elijah too.

427
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,390
我自私地为了自己的幸福
冒着将家族摧毁的危险
I risked tearing our family apart
for my own, selfish happiness.

428
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:48,829
我请求你，求求你
不要让麦可来到这里
I am begging you. Please.
Don't bring Mikael here.

429
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:51,327
要是克劳斯发现我们所做的一切
If Klaus finds out
what we have done,

430
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,164
你所做的一切
what you have done...

431
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,869
克劳斯会杀了我
他会杀了我全家
Klaus will kill me.
He'll kill my entire family.

432
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,104
这正是我要你撤销咒语的原因
Which is exactly
why I need you to undo it.

433
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,679
这是不可能的
It doesn't work that way.

434
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,045
没办法撤销
麦可就要来了
There is no "undoing it."
Mikael is coming.

435
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:10,018
现在唯一的希望
就是告诉克劳斯真相
The only hope now
is tell Klaus the truth.

436
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,246
坦白我们所做的事情
Confess what we've done.

437
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:12,549
绝对不可以
That is not an option.

438
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,487
他会用匕首封住我
把我关在棺材里数个世纪
He will dagger me
and leave me in a box for centuries.

439
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,423
你什么都不许说
You will not say a word.

440
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,625
你利用了我
You used me.

441
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:26,068
自始至终，我们的友谊
你想要的只是我的能力
This whole time, our friendship,
all you wanted was a favor.

442
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:27,933
而现在你后悔了想要收回这一切？
And now, you want to take it back?

443
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,596
你不能
Well, you can't.

444
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:30,730
克劳斯不会怪我的
And I will not suffer

445
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,274
因为我只是太愚蠢选择相信了你
because I was foolish enough
to trust you.

446
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,810
那是个错误，我现在意识到了
It was a mistake.
I know that, now.

447
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,937
但这个错误会毁了我们的
But that one mistake
will destroy us.

448
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,214
这是你自找的
You brought this on yourself.

449
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,322
我不能和你一起被摧毁
I will not be destroyed
along with you.

450
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:53,396
我很抱歉，洁妮薇
I'm so sorry, Genevieve.

451
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,366
但如果你告诉尼克劳斯你召唤了麦可
But if you tell Niklaus
you summoned Mikael,

452
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,934
迟早你也是死路一条
you're dead, either way.

453
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,597
洁妮薇，没事吧？
Genevieve?
Is everything all right?

454
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,676
所以你把我也感染了
So you infected me too.

455
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:13,910
并魅惑护理员将我们隔离直到死去
Compelled the orderlies to keep us
in quarantine until we died.

456
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,093
（隔离病房）

457
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,539
幸运的是，我占用了另一个身体
CELESTE: Fortunately,
I just took another body.

458
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,706
洁妮薇就没那么幸运了
Genevieve wasn't so lucky.

459
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:53,146
既然她回来了
Well, now that she's back...

460
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,191
你就是那个不幸的人了
...you're the one
whose luck's run out.

461
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,230
抱歉
GENEVlEVE: I'm sorry.

462
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:04,891
我知道这很伤人
I know how much this hurts.

463
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,663
看到她的所作所为
To see what she did.

464
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:10,672
看清她的真正面目
To see who she really is.

465
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,639
但你必须要知道
But you needed to know.

466
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:18,408
你必须要看到
You needed to see it.

467
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:23,248
现在你都知道了，你可以复仇了
And now that you have,
you can take your revenge.

468
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:26,015
我们的复仇
Our revenge.

469
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,859
来吧，喝吧
Please.
Go ahead.

470
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:37,195
为了接下来的事你会需要力量
You'll need your strength
for what comes next.

471
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,665
蕾贝卡！
Rebekah!

472
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,066
蕾贝卡！
Rebekah!

473
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,716
我们应该分头找
We should divide the building.

474
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:06,482
我从这边开始，你去那边
I'll start at one end,
you at the other.

475
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:23,166
尼克，尼克，那不是真的
Nik. Nik, it isn't true.

476
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,707
我想要相信你，妹妹
I want to believe you, sister.

477
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,378
但你的表情出卖了你
But your face tells
a different story.

478
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,488
你躲不了我的，蕾贝卡
You cannot hide from me, Rebekah!

479
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:42,019
你也逃不掉
Nor can you run.

480
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,851
一切到此结束
This ends now.

481
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,536
你好啊，贱女巫
Hey, there, witch-bitch.

482
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,206
我们得好好聊一下了
You and l
are gonna have a little chat.

483
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,018
蕾贝卡！
KLAUS: Rebekah!

484
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:37,605
逃够了吗？
Tired of running?

485
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:44,246
我知道你有多享受追逐猎物的感觉
我不想给你更多这种快感
I know how much you enjoy the chase.
I'd sooner deny you the pleasure.

486
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,357
那我就用其他方式来享受吧
Well, then, I'll take my pleasures
in other ways.

487
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,585
我不会再让你插匕首躺棺材了
No more daggered-in-a-box
for you.

488
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,889
相信我，妹妹，你会怀念匕首的感觉的
Trust me, sister. You'll long
for what the dagger offered.

489
00:38:56,033 --> 00:39:00,060
这个，就没那么仁慈了
This will be far less merciful.

490
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:04,300
要如何确切描述这把刀的用途呢？
How to describe exactly
what this blade does?

491
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,467
你用不着这么做，尼克
You don't have to do this, Nik.

492
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:11,206
当它插入你的心脏后
你将无法动弹
After I plunge this into your heart,
you will be immobilized,

493
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:16,753
处在一种撕心裂肺的无比痛苦之中
imprisoned in a state of raw,
inescapable anguish.

494
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,912
时间将毫无意义
Time loses all meaning.

495
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,082
如同人间炼狱
因为你的背叛
It's not unlike a living hell,
which I find rather fitting

496
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:23,557
我觉得这样处罚再适合不过了
given your treachery.

497
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:28,097
那就动手吧
如果这就是你想要的
Then, do it.
If that's what you really want.

498
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,165
我们跳过了你祈求饶恕的那段吗？
Are we skipping the part
where you beg for mercy?

499
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,601
祈求我原谅？
For forgiveness?

500
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,039
因为我本来真的很期待呢
Because I was really
looking forward to that.

501
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,045
不必了
I'll pass.

502
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,639
我很清楚这对我不会有什么好处
I know better than to think
it would do me any good.

503
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,152
那就这样了吗？
你放弃抵抗了
That's it, then?
You concede.

504
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,327
如同一头待宰的羔羊
Like a lamb to the slaughter.

505
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:02,955
你觉得父亲会怎么想你？
What would your father
think of you, now?

506
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,469
正是我想见的人
Just the man I wanted to see.

507
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,936
看着你死，蕾贝卡的惩罚
Rebekah's punishment
won't be complete

508
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,804
才算完整呢
until she watches you die.

509
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,538
尼克，召唤麦可是我的主意
Nik, it was my idea
to summon Mikael.

510
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,308
如果你要伤害谁，那一定就是我
If you're gonna hurt anyone,
it should be me.

511
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,147
对你的爱人真是忠贞啊
Such loyalty to your beloved.

512
00:41:02,092 --> 00:41:03,252
你知道…
You know...

513
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:07,627
如果你给过我哪怕是一丁点的忠诚
If you had offered me
even a fraction of the same,

514
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:09,232
我也就不必这么做了
I wouldn't have to do this.

515
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:28,540
走吧
Go.

516
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:34,118
你们俩尽快逃走吧，越远越好
Both of you,
run as far and as fast as you can.

517
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,589
跑啊！
Run!

518
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:52,806
