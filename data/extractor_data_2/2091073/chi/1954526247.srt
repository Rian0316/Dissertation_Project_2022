我最近感觉很不爽
I've been feeling
kind of funky lately.

别让她喝醉了 那只会让事情更糟 
Don't be getting her drunk  it only
makes things worse. It says depression

167
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:13,270
人们说沮丧其实是月经的症状

168
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,305
debs 不要去相信电脑上的鬼话

Grammy bought us that stuff.
Yeah? Well, we have no money

173
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,883
偷了我们的存款之后 我们就没钱了
since Monica stole the Squirrel Fund,

174
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:26,984
但是我们需要食物
and we need to eat!

Now, go. And when you get back,
take the pool down

179
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,061
  在它结冰之前 将泳池的水抽干 --我不知道怎么弄
before it freezes and cracks.
I don't know how!

180
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:39,396
你会弄明白的 没那么难
You'll figure it out;
it's not that hard.

181
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,897
Lip?

183
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:44,835

184
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,438
monica 起来
Monica, get up.

00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,583
我需要你的帮助 记得么
I need your help.
Remember,

192
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:03,585
我告诉过你在我的母亲死之前 她给把所有钱
I told you my mother mailed all
her money to my brothers

193
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,320
都寄给了我的兄弟  -frank 让我一个人呆着

Frank, leave me alone.

194
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:06,254
好吧 那是我的钱
Well, that's ny money.

195
00:08:06,288 --> 00:08:07,856
我应得的
I deserve it.

196
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,591
当她快死的时候是我陪在她的身边
I was with her on her death bed.

197
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,025
我付了医院的账单
I paid the hospital bills

198
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,694
而且还举行了一个葬礼

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:14,695
(Monica grunts)

200
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,430
(sighs)

201
00:08:16,464 --> 00:08:17,631

204
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,101
不用 Frank 别
No, Frank, please...

205
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,335

208
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,142

你可不能躺在这
You can't lie down in the shower.

216
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,899
而且
Also, you never use
toilet paper on your dick

217
00:08:50,934 --> 00:08:52,802
你尿完了之后也不需要用纸擦你的鸡巴
after you take a piss.

218
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:56,238
你抖一抖，甩几滴出来，冲掉就行了
You tap the end, let the
drops fall off, flush.

219
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:58,040
- 这很像是当爹的话
- 这真的是
- That's very fatherly.
- Is that really? - Yeah.

220

嗯，如果这能让他
Well, if it'll prevent him from

222
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,577
不被人锁在更衣间里
being heckled in the locker room

223
00:09:01,611 --> 00:09:03,178
当然，一定要告诉他
by other guys, absolutely.

224
00:09:03,212 --> 00:09:04,813
为什么领养家长非要你做这么个
Why'd the parents get you to make this

225
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,047
-傻不拉及的玩意

00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,851
我想给我儿子留几手好让他能活下去
I wanted to give my son
some tools to survive.

我不是你亲娘
I'm not your real mom.

230
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:15,424
她不想和你有任何的关系
She didn't want anything
to do with you.

231
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,927
-你凑什么热闹
-我肚子里的孩子还没成型 可能八个细胞那么大吧
Look who's talking. Well, mine was barely a baby.
Like, eight cells or something.

232
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,996
-你干什么
-你看我像在干什么
What are you doing?
What does it look like I'm doing?

233
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,165
别闹了 我们得录完像
Hey, come on, we need to finish the video.
Wouldn't it be cool if

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,334
如果你一边被口交一边和你孩子说话是不是很爽
you're getting a blow job and talking
to your kid at the same time?

235
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:29,238
额 我觉得等会再录也行
Yeah, I guess we can
finish the video later.

236
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:32,208
你知道
You know, this will be

237
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:35,444
这是咱俩第三次上床
the third time we've been together.
Mm-hmm.

238
00:09:35,478 --> 00:09:36,912
通常第三次之后
Usually after the third
time, I either stop

239
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,281
要么拉倒 要么弄清楚我们的关系
or we have to figure it out.

240
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:40,082
-弄明白
-对
Figure it out?
Yeah.

241
00:09:40,117 --> 00:09:41,751
比如，咱俩算什么
Like, what we're doing and stuff.

242
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,255
额，我觉得咱俩就是炮友
Well, I thought we
were just hanging out.

243
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,556
或许咱俩该结束了
Maybe we should stop.

244
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:51,394
别，我可不想让你结束
N-No, I don't
want to stop.

245
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:53,363
那么
(muffled):
So, uh, we're gonna

246
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:55,432

figure it out and stuff?

247
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,567
当然
Absolutely.

248
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,069

来了
(knocking) Yeah, coming.

250
00:10:05,677 --> 00:10:08,078
看来宾馆服务员越来越漂亮了
Well, room service is getting hotter.

251
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:10,114
他在么
Is he here?

252
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:12,150
现在没有
Uh, not at the moment,

253
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,151
但他住在这
but yes.
He's been here

254
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:16,887
他在这都几个礼拜了 你为什么还没有听我的赶他走
for weeks now; why haven't you
kicked him out like I said?

255
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,223
-因为我不用听你的
-从什么时候开始
Because I don't do everything you tell me to do.
Since when?

256
00:10:19,257 --> 00:10:20,391
你连自己说的话都不算数
How am I supposed to trust you

257
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:21,659
我怎么相信你
if you don't keep your word?

258
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,127
我从来没说过我会赶他走
I never said I would
kick him out; in fact,

259
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,829
而且我让他住在这也是看了你的面子
I was doing you a favor
by letting him stay here.

260
00:10:24,863 --> 00:10:26,997
真的啊？因为你是这么个正直的好人
Really? Because you're such
an upstanding citizen?

261
00:10:27,032 --> 00:10:29,600
你到底让他帮你干什么 偷车
What do you have him
doing? Stealing cars?

Lip现在很乱，Karen的事让他很纠结

天天喝的死醉
Drinking like a fish.

264
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,171
他回家就没事了
He'll be fine once he comes home.

265
00:10:34,206 --> 00:10:37,975
你了解青春期的男孩么
Do you know anything
about teenage boys?

266
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:42,914
你不能逼他们
You can't give them ultimatums.

267
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:45,082
(screaming)

268

额，坦白说吧，Fiona

I want to be with you,
but I'm not one of those kids

280
00:11:10,577 --> 00:11:11,710

想想以前吧

一会我们就发财了

你说我们能诓他多少钱

00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,442
用ipad还换不了个鲁格（手枪名）
Wouldn't trade me an iPad for a Ruger.

307
00:12:13,476 --> 00:12:15,611
没人会给你把枪 Carl
No one's gonna let
you have a gun, Carl.

308
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:18,647
小Hank就有一把
Little Hank gets to have one.
Because his dad

309
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:20,916
因为他爹抢了一堆军用物资
hijacked a bunch of military cargo.

310
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:23,786
我们要收掉泳池了 Conrad
We got to empty the pool out, Conrad.

311
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,221
你们该出来了
You guys got to get out of here.

312
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,456
给，去把管子插到
Here, go screw this end of the hose

313
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,792
Tony家下水道里
into Tony's spigot

314
00:12:28,826 --> 00:12:30,160
我们就能把水抽出来了
so we can siphon the water out.

315
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,728
或者我们可以这么干
Or we could just do it this way.

316
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:33,797
Carl!

317
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,433
明年夏天我来修
I'll patch it up next summer.

318
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:38,802
See ya.
(sighs)

319
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:44,074
抱歉 毁了你的澡盆 Conrad
Sorry we ruined your bathtub, Conrad.

320
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:45,442
没事的 我可以去
It's okay; I’ll go down

321
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:48,445
Hyatt那的地基
to the fountain in front of the Hyatt.

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,147
还没冻上
Hasn't frozen over yet.

323
00:12:50,182 --> 00:12:52,183
你就不能去那个给穷人的免费门诊去洗澡么
Can't you just shower
at the free clinic?

324
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,417
(sirens wail in distance)
我喜欢泡着
I like baths.

325
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:55,853
从小就是
A childhood thing.

326
00:12:55,887 --> 00:12:58,155
你怎么了
Why the long face?

327
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,124
我觉得我有忧郁症
I think I have depression.

328
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:01,692
遗传的
It's hereditary.

329
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,594
我妈就是
My mother has it.

330
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:07,364
额 过来 坐这
Well, come here, have a seat.

331
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:09,800
我来告诉你一些关于抑郁症的事情
I can tell you a few
things about depression.

332
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:12,369
你能先把裤子穿上么
Mind if you put your pants on first?

333
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,478
我们为啥要在这见他
Hey, why are we meeting him here?

334
00:13:20,512 --> 00:13:22,146
因为他怀疑海关一直盯着他
Well, he's paranoid that customs
might've tailed him

335
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,914
只要他从集装箱里出来就会被抓住
once he finally got
out of the shipping container.

336
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:27,851
是他么
Este 过来
Is that him?
Este, Este, get out here.

337
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:29,119
Yep, yep,

00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:31,622
我觉得是他
(honking) I think this is him.

339
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:34,024
(squeals)

340
00:13:36,094 --> 00:13:38,729
? Two, three four ?

341
00:13:38,763 --> 00:13:40,864
? Listen, baby ?

342
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:42,966
? You know it's true ?

343
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,802
? There's another side ?

344
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:46,537
? It's all for you ?

345
00:13:46,571 --> 00:13:48,472
? Yes, it's true ? My baby!

346
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:50,574
? All for you ?

347
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:51,908
你的五千 我的朋友
There's your five grand, my friend.

348
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:55,011
Oh, baby! (squeals)

349
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,312
? Do-do-doo ?

350
00:13:56,346 --> 00:13:58,347
? Do-do-doo ?

351
00:13:58,382 --> 00:13:59,315
令人感动的重逢
That's quite a homecoming.

352
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:00,716
真爱
True love.

353
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,817
? The only one for me ?

354
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:03,519
像疤面煞星里的情节一样
Insert <i>Scarface</i> joke here.

355
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:04,919
? Do-do-doo ?

356
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:06,854
嘿，你好
Hey, how are you?

357
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:09,523

Grab that...

358
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,192
准备好了
All right, you ready?

359
00:14:17,965 --> 00:14:20,400
(knocking)

大惊喜
Surprise.

361
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,338
哦，别这样
Aw, come on.

362
00:14:24,372 --> 00:14:26,440
擦 天啊 Frank 你在这干什么呢
Aw, Jesus, Frank, what the
fuc+ are you doing here?

363
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,376
用这种方式来迎接你最爱的老兄
Is that any way to greet
your favorite brother?

364
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,744
不，你不能进来
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You can't come in.

365
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,112
Frank.
Oh, Clayton.

366
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:33,347
还像以前那么帅
Handsome as ever.

367
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,448
你为什么
Why didn't you come by

368
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,450
不在母亲快死的时候过来看看
to visit Mommy when she was dying,

369
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,051
-Calyton？
-因为我压根不知道
Clayton?
Because I didn't even know

370
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:39,887
她死之前就出了监狱
she was out of prison
until after she was dead.

371
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,522
我一个人照顾她的方方面面
I had to take care
of her all by myself.

372
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,391
我有点渴了
I'm a little thirsty;
is the kitchen

373
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,692
厨房在这里么 求你了 monica不要进去
in here?
Please, Monica,

374
00:14:44,726 --> 00:14:47,028
听说她把钱寄给了你，Wyatt
don't...
Heard she sent you, Wyatt

375
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,363
和Jerry
and Jerry her money.

376
00:14:48,397 --> 00:14:50,131
是 一点点钱
A few dollars, yeah.

377
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,432
一分钱也没给我
Didn't leave me anything.

378
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,201
-老婆在么
-没有
Is the wifey here?
No.

379
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:54,235
上班呢
Work.
(popping)

380
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,037
怎么了 Frank,她在干什么
What was that?
Frank, what is she doing?

381
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:57,438
在我看来
Seems to me it's only
fair that you and I

382
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,040
咱俩把钱分了就成了
split the money, since I

383
00:14:59,074 --> 00:15:00,608
她死前是我照顾的
looked after Mommy on her death bed.

384
00:15:00,642 --> 00:15:02,810
我一直想试试凯歌香槟
Wow, I've always wanted
to try Veuve Clicquot.

385
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:05,646
啊，我们为感恩节准备的
Aw, we just bought
that for Thanksgiving!

386
00:15:05,681 --> 00:15:07,548
节日快乐
Oh. Happy Holidays.

387
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:09,783
真的，你们必须要走了
Okay, really.
You have to go now.

388
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,551
-不给我钱就让我走？
-对不起
Not without my share of the money.
I'm sorry,

389
00:15:11,586 --> 00:15:12,986
Frank，我什么也给不了你
Frank, there's nothing
for me to give you.

390
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,087
钱已经花了
Okay, the money's spent.

391
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,489
我用它还了贷款
I used it to catch up on the mortgage.

392
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,558
好的
Fine, be that way.

393
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:18,993
 既然你不想给我钱
You don't want to give me any money,

394
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:21,496
那你就一辈子背着良心的债吧
let it rest
on your conscience, Clayton.

395
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,000
现在我去一下厕所
Now, I'm going to go to
the bathroom, and then

396
00:15:25,034 --> 00:15:27,803
然后就永不相见
we will be out of your hair for good.

397
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:32,775
很久了
Long time, huh?

398
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,446
来
Come here, you.

399
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,115
别这样，Monica
Oh, Monica, don't do this.

400
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:40,249
哪样？
Do what?

401
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:41,751
靠我这么近
Get so close to me.

402
00:15:41,785 --> 00:15:42,986
你的意思是就像
You mean like when we did

403
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,822
我们在科米斯基公园磕粉卖体恤的时候么
PCP at Comiskey Park
and sold T-shirts?

404
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,691
你那时可是大众情人
You were quite the ladies' man then.

405
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,527
我一分钱都不会给你
I'm not gonna give you any money.

406
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,928
你也知道 Frank拿不到钱
Well, you know Frank is not gonna

407
00:15:50,962 --> 00:15:52,596
就不会走
leave here without a couple thousands.

408
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:55,999
-哦，老天
-你最好让你的钱花的更值
Oh, my God.
So, you might as well get your money's worth.

409
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,969
Monica，我不能
Monica, I-I can't.

410
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,203
我以为你抗拒不了我
I thought you couldn't resist me.

411
00:16:00,238 --> 00:16:01,104
对不起
I'm sorry.

412
00:16:01,138 --> 00:16:02,972
莫莫莫 错错错
No, no, no.
No, I can't, I can't.

413
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:03,973

00:16:06,576 --> 00:16:08,210
对不起，你必须走
I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go.

416
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,111
-啊
-怎么了
Yeah?
What?

417
00:16:10,146 --> 00:16:12,146
你在干什么
What are you doing?

401
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,714
亲爱的 你不能躺在这里
Sweetheart, no, you
can't lie down here.

402

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,622
-亲爱的 亲爱的  -你对她做什么了
Honey, honey...
What did you do to her?

406
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:23,057
什么也没有 我们刚只是在说话
Nothing, we were just talking.

407
00:16:23,091 --> 00:16:27,729
怎么回事
Hey, what's going on? Huh?

408
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,497
他不想要我
He didn't want me.

409
00:16:29,532 --> 00:16:31,332
他不想要我
He didn't want me.

410
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:33,701
没事的
That's okay.

411

我是个又老又丑的巫婆
I'm an ugly old hag.

412
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,005
-不是这样的  -是的
That is not true.
Yeah.

413
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,974

414
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,810

你很漂亮
You are.

我带你回家
I'm gonna take you home.

417
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:50,084
好吗 没事的
Okay? It's okay.

418
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,719
我和你的事还没完
I'm not finished with you yet.

419
00:16:55,023 --> 00:16:57,525
Marco 你饿吗
Are you hungry, Marco?

420
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,059
他现在恐怕对吃的
Yeah, I don't think he really gives a shit

421
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:00,327
一点兴趣也没有
about food right now.

422
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,361
好了
All right.

422
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,361
用力 Marco 用力 用力

说的没错
Probably right.

424
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,039
你姐要把我逼疯了
Your sister's driving
me crazy; I don't know

425
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,740
我不知道怎样才能让她信任我
what it's gonna take
for her to trust me.

426
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:16,709
-重新信任我  -你能怪她吗
Again.
Can you blame her?

427
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,046
你另外有个家庭
You know, you have
a whole other family.

428
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,582
一开始你名字是Steve 然后是Jimmy
First, your name was
Steve, then Jimmy.

429
00:17:21,616 --> 00:17:23,417
跑去巴西 然后消失了
You know, you disappear to Brazil.

430
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:25,553
回来的时候又已经结婚
Come back married.

431
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,522
你这样 恐怕她很难信任你
You know, it's kind of a
tough way to build up trust.

432
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,391
但我真的值得信任
I really am trustworthy, though.

433
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:32,227
你得做点什么才能证明自己
Yeah, well, you're gonna have to
do something bold to prove it.

434
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:33,362
享受我的黑木耳吧
Oh, my pussy for you.

435
00:17:33,397 --> 00:17:34,797
宝贝儿 对 就是那样
Yeah, babe, like that.

All right, dude, you got
to get me out of this car.

437
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:38,401
我要疯了 靠边停车吧
I'm getting too horned
out; pull over here?

438
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,471

你打算回家了不
You ready to go home yet?

440
00:17:46,275 --> 00:17:48,442
你想甩掉我吗
Are you trying to get rid of me?

441
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,744
只是问一问
Just wondering.

442
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,646
不 我不想住家里了
No, you know what,
I think I'm done living at home.

443
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,981
我想自力更生
I like being on my own.

444
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,582
你所谓的自力更生就是睡在
And by being on your own
you mean sleeping

445
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,285
我豪华客房的沙发上吗
on my couch at the Ritz?

446
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,054
回见
See ya.

447
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,059
-感觉怎样  -好 好
Mm, yeah?
<i>Si, si!</i>

448
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,362
别担心 我不觉得奇怪
Don't worry, this isn't too weird.

449
00:18:07,464 --> 00:18:09,465
? Make her booty bounce,
bounce, b-bounce, bounce ?

450
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,368
? Make her booty bounce... ?

451
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,839
火鸡肚子里填什么料呢
So, what kind of
stuffing should we make?

452
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,408
有酱汁那种
I like the one with sausage in it.

453
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:18,642
那就吃
Then sausage

454
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:20,010
有酱汁那种
we shall have.

455
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:21,478
-因为我爱你哦  -谢谢妈妈
Because I love you.
Thanks, Mom.

456
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,479
我不会做任何事
And I would never do anything

457
00:18:22,513 --> 00:18:24,781
惹你心烦或者伤害你
to upset you or to hurt you.

458
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:27,684
-嗯  -至少不会故意的
Okay.
At least not on purpose.

459
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:28,786
我知道
I know.

460
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,154
不是说
That's not to say

461
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:33,124
一些冲动战胜理智
some urges might overtake me,

462
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:35,460
让我不经脑子地
and cause me to think unclearly

463
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,629
做一些丢脸的事
and do things that I'm shamefully,

464
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:39,363
尴尬而羞愧的事
shamefully embarrassed about.

465
00:18:39,398 --> 00:18:41,432
你是说你和Jody睡的事吗
Is this about you sleeping with Jody?

466
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:42,768
什么
What?

467
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,770
不... 是
No.... Yes.

468
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:45,971
也许是
Maybe.

469
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:47,606
-你都知道了  -是的 妈妈
You know about that?
Yeah, Mom.

470
00:18:47,641 --> 00:18:49,775
亲爱的 我真的好抱歉
Honey, I'm so sorry.

471
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,010
我不是故意的
I didn't mean to.

472
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:52,345
只是个意外
It was an accident.

473
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,513
一个他鸡鸡跑到
An accident where

474
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:55,048
你阴道里的意外
his penis slipped into your vagina?

475
00:18:55,082 --> 00:18:57,784
我的天啊
Oh, God.
Hey.

476
00:18:57,818 --> 00:18:58,651
发生什么事了
Hey, what's going on?

477
00:18:58,686 --> 00:18:59,886
我妈刚告诉我
My mom was just telling me

478
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,154
她睡了Jody
how she fucked Jody.
Oh.

479
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,022
亲爱的
Sweetheart!

480
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:03,523
不是那样的
It was not like that.

481
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:04,557
不错嘛 Sheila
Way to go, Sheila.
Oh!

482
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:05,658
和你说 妈妈
You know what, Mom?

483
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:06,826
我不在乎
I don't care.

484
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,828
事实上 我希望你继续搞他
In fact, I want you to screw him more.

485
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:10,296
一直搞他
Screw him all the time.

486
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,664
他是你的了
Take him, he's yours.

487
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,832
让他离我远点
Get him off my back.

488
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,701
Jody 进来
Jody, get in here!

489
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:22,842
他要进来了 现在
He's coming in here? Now?

490
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:24,510
我有话和你说
Hey, I need to talk to you.

491
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:25,711
怎么 你也上了我妈
Why? You fuck my mom, too?

492
00:19:25,745 --> 00:19:26,979
是啊 报复啊
Yeah, payback's a bitch.

493
00:19:27,013 --> 00:19:29,148
-你要生宝宝了吗  -没有
Are you having the baby?
No.

494
00:19:29,182 --> 00:19:30,382
帮着她填充火鸡
Help her with the stuffing

495
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,651
或者其他什么 你们想做的事
or whatever it is that you guys do together.

496
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:33,686

你想说什么
So, what do you want?

501
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:39,224
我在想 你决定
I was wondering if you, uh,

502
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,492
把宝宝送给
decided on a couple

503
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:42,060

Mark和Celeste

他们给的钱最多 8千刀
They gave me the most cash;
eight grand.

507

但是我想 Jeff 和Alana好些
Okay, but I was thinking, um,

他们只给我5千的样子
They only gave me, like, five.

510
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:56,040

Jeff和Alana
Jeff and Alana

会是对更好的父母
would be better parents.

513
00:19:58,377 --> 00:19:59,878
如果Mark和Celeste钱给的更多
Seems unfair they should get the kid

514
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:02,581
孩子却给别人 这不公平吧
if Mark and Celeste paid more.

515
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:05,017
好吧 如果你不高兴的话 把手机给我吧
Fine, if you're gonna pout about
it, just give me your phone.

Go take a shower.
Carl,

533
00:20:46,026 --> 00:20:47,159
水池我搞定了一半
I took down half of the pool.

534
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:48,594
剩下的该你了
You have to do the rest.

535
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:50,095
我猜明天没的火鸡吃了
Guess we're not having
turkey tomorrow.

536
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,731
太贵了 当东西的钱得用来付账单
Too expensive. Got to use
pawnshop money for the bills.

537
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,266
但这看起来也挺像火鸡的 对不对
But it kind of looks like
a turkey, doesn't it?

538
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,434
挺不错的
Yeah, it's pretty good.

539
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:57,269
闻起来很香
This smells good.
Hey,

540
00:20:57,304 --> 00:20:59,005
我这个要卖给西边的Campbell太太
I'm selling those to
Mrs. Campbell over on Western.

541
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,273
20刀一个
20 bucks a pop.

542
00:21:00,307 --> 00:21:02,675
我不用再担心我会得抑郁的事了
So I'm not worried
I have depression anymore.

543
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,911
-为什么 怎么回事  -和我朋友Conrad谈过
Why, what happened?
Talked to my friend Conrad.

544
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:07,414
说是抑郁隔代遗传
Says depression usually
skips a generation.

545
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:08,415
Conrad?

546
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,251
住在我们水池的流浪汉
The homeless guy in our pool.

547
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:11,786
好吧
Okay.

548
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,954
就算不是隔代遗传
And even if it doesn't
skip a generation,

549
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:16,523
也只有20%的遗传几率
it usually only runs
in 20% of the family.

550
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,926
20% 这数字还能接受
One in five--
those are okay odds.

551
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,927
我想 要得也是Lip吧
Way I figure it, it's going to be Lip.

552
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,195
他已经差不多抑郁了
He's halfway there as it is.

553
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:23,863
也许不应该把他踢出家门
Probably shouldn't have
kicked him out.

554
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:31,003
我是Lip 别傻了 留言吧

有时候是在打架 还真分辨不出来
Sometimes it's fighting. Can't
really tell the difference.

564
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,405
我们的酒店
Our hotel...

566
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:07,642
别在里面叫喊了
Don't be rubbing your apple in there.

567
00:22:07,676 --> 00:22:09,310
不能同时听两边
I can't listen to it from both sides.

568
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,260
好了
Okay.

569

into the world on Friday.

I hope I get to hang out
with you for a few minutes

573
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,605
能和你待几分钟
before we hand you over
to your new parents.

574
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,940
我想他们能把你照顾得很好
I think they're really going
to take very good care of you.

575
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:45,443
我希望能养育你
<i>You know, I wish</i>
<i>it could have been us.</i>

576
00:22:46,478 --> 00:22:48,545
但
But, um...

577
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:51,014
现在我身边一切都
well, things are pretty messed up

578
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:53,683
乱七八糟 所以
around here, so...

579
00:22:53,717 --> 00:22:55,618
如果你想
Um...
<i>You ever want</i>

580
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:59,688
和我联系的话 我很高兴
to get in touch with me, though,
that, that would be cool.

581
00:22:59,723 --> 00:23:04,260
就来找这张丑脸
You know, just, uh, just look
for this ugly mug.

582
00:23:07,097 --> 00:23:09,065
我就在这里
You know, I'll be around.

583
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:13,970
不会去其他地方的
I'm not going anywhere.

584
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:18,808
好了 没事的 小家伙
All right, take it easy, buddy.

585
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,589

585
00:23:29,088 --> 00:23:30,189
他是我老公

585
00:23:30,288 --> 00:23:32,087
我以为再也见不到你了

585
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:34,009
说英语 Marco 发生什么事了
English.
Marco, what's going on?

585
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:35,789
我这么辛苦跑来 为的却是个妓女

585
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,789
需要我提醒你 你之前上了我妹妹吗

585
00:23:37,788 --> 00:23:40,389
上她是最接近于上你 所以不能算

586
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,963
等等 你他妈的不痛吗
Wait, doesn't that fucking hurt?

-没什么  -Lip 他们在说什么
Nothing.
Uh, Lip, what are they saying?

589
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:46,468
我觉得他生气
I think he's probably pissed

590
00:23:46,502 --> 00:23:47,936
是因为你上了Estefania
because you fucked Estefania?

你跟这转什么呢
看起来怎么样
What are you doing over there?
What's it look like?

781
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:25,865
弄来一只秃鹰
什么？
Plucking a bald eagle.
What?

782
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,934
Carl 在院子里打死的
Carl shot it in the yard.

783
00:31:27,968 --> 00:31:30,570
用什么打
那是违法的
With what?
That's against the law.

784
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,439
我已经给他上了一课了
况且 子弹已经拿出来了
I already gave him a lecture.
And took out the bullets.

785
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,408
这上面说 这是一个放生的项目
DEBBIE: It says there was
a re-release program

786
00:31:34,442 --> 00:31:35,542
在密歇根州的半岛
in the Michigan peninsula.

787
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,643
动物园有十只秃鹰
Let out ten bald eagles

788
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,978
被放生到野外了

789
00:31:38,012 --> 00:31:39,379
从动物园到野生
in the Detroit Zoo into the wild.

790
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:41,447
昨天晚上 我碰到一只
And one of them came to me last night.

791
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,884
他腿上有个什么东西 --是跟踪器
You know, there is something on his leg.
That's a tracking device.

792
00:31:43,918 --> 00:31:45,285
这样的话 他们就可以知道老鹰在哪筑巢
That way, they can
monitor where it nests.

793
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:47,454
好吧 有人知道老鹰在我们这吗  可能
So, somebody knows that we have it?
Probably.

794
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,589
恩 一定挺疼的吧 老鹰
Uh, it must have hurt, huh, buddy?

795
00:31:49,624 --> 00:31:51,091
我第一枪就打中它了
Got him on my first shot.

796
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,759
据说
Says tampering with a bald eagle

797
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:53,594
抓住老鹰的人

798
00:31:53,628 --> 00:31:55,129
会被依法制裁的
punishable by law.

799
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,831
问题解决了
Problem solved.

800
00:31:56,865 --> 00:31:58,299
Carl 这个给你  把这些证据处理掉
Here, Carl, get rid of the evidence.


801
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,068
(hissing) Eww!

802
00:32:00,102 --> 00:32:01,936
这个我们可以留到周末吃
Guess we can save this
for the weekend.

803
00:32:01,971 --> 00:32:03,772
为什么啊  我们感恩节要吃什么啊
Why? What are we having
for Thanksgiving?

804
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:08,310
不是吧 不是吧
No, no, no, no, no. No.

805
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:11,647
这么看 它真挺像教堂里面的摆设一样
It's just like the pilgrims intended.

806
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,981
(distant laughter, Monica sighs)

807
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,018
感恩节快乐
Happy Thanksgiving.

808
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:17,452
Hmm.

809
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:19,120
Oh.

810
00:32:19,155 --> 00:32:20,522
别这样
Stop it.

811
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:21,923
(Frank sighs)

812
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,292
我没那个心情
I'm not in the mood.

813
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,327
你一直都爱干这事的啊
You're always in the mood.

814
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,296
用手怎么样
How about a little handy J?

815
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,966
你什么也不用干
You don't have to do anything.

816
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,168
我自己来
I'll do all the work.

817
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:36,172
我的小宝贝啊
That's a girl.

818
00:32:36,207 --> 00:32:38,508
(Frank moaning)

819
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:42,613
Moni 你手得握得紧一点
Moni, you got to squeeze a little.

820
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:56,728
Mm.

821
00:32:56,762 --> 00:33:00,165
你是该吃药了 是不
Time for you to go back
on your meds, huh?

822
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:02,500
(sighs)

823
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,870

827
00:33:15,949 --> 00:33:18,351
(train rattling)

828
00:33:19,553 --> 00:33:21,855

我们俩是要来找个人帮我们开车的

burritos at Juan's truck after.

843
00:33:43,577 --> 00:33:45,878

我的心 都碎了
My heart-- it's broken.

你这对我打击太大了
我不知道我该怎么办了
I'm probably gonna go through
a lot of depression over this.

00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,749
我们不可能白白浪费
There's no way we're gonna
