1
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,839
霍华德・沃罗威茨
Howard Wolowitz.

2
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,899
霍华德  我是太空总署的戴夫・罗杰
Hey, Howard. Dave Roeger here at NASA.

3
00:00:10,909 --> 00:00:12,979
我们需要谈谈你接下来的任务
We need to talk about your upcoming mission.

4
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,409
没问题  我每天都还有在做俯卧撑呢
Yes, yes, I've been doing my push-ups.

5
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:20,179
虽然我目前只能做九个  但... 
I'm still stuck at nine, but...

6
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:25,499
这都是没人托着我的情况下顺利完成的
...that's going all the way down with no one holding me.

7
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,019
那很好  但这不是我找你的原因
That's great, uh, but that's not why I called.

8
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:30,909
我们遇到点大麻烦
We've run into a bit of a snafu.

9
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,389
你的联盟号太空舱没通过增压测试
Your Soyuz capsule failed the pressurization test,

10
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:36,809
总而言之  你的任务被废止了
so bottom line, mission's been scrubbed.

11
00:00:38,779 --> 00:00:41,249
不是吧  那"废止"的意思是...
You're kidding. So what does that mean?

12
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:48,549
我不得不说
Boy, I got to tell you,

13
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:49,999
我真的很失望
I'm really disappointed.

14
00:00:49,999 --> 00:00:54,009
这是我儿时以来的梦想
This was my dream ever since I was a little kid.

15
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:57,919
无论如何  还是要感谢您的来电
Okay, well, uh,  thanks for the call.

16
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,319
好的  您也保重
Yep, you, too.

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,109
太棒了  谢天谢地啊
Yes! Thank you!

18
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:09,049
老子不用死在太空里了
I'm not gonna die in space!

19
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,139
我可以按照上帝的旨意
I'm gonna die the way God intended,

20
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,509
五六十岁时  死于吃太多熏肉引发的心脏病了
in my late 50s, with a heart full of pastrami.

21
00:01:17,419 --> 00:01:21,399

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,209
生活大爆炸  第五季第二十三集

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,190
我需要一件更大的衬衫
I'm going to need a larger shirt.

31
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,330
这件腋下部位有点紧
This one's a little tight under the arms.

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,420
好吧
Okay.

33
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,010
你不觉得之所以会紧
Do you think maybe it's tight

34
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,830
是因为你里面穿了套长的内衣裤吗
because you're wearing long underwear?

35
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,970
废话  当然是因为这个
Yes, of course that's why it's tight.

36
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,880
好吧  让我重新表述下问题
All right, let me rephrase the question.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,480
你干嘛要穿长的内衣裤啊
Why are you wearing long underwear?

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,920
你不是吧
You're kidding.

39
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,370
重点应该是  "为何你不穿长内衣裤"
Shouldn't the question be: why <i>aren't</i> you?

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,160
不  应该是"为何你穿啊"
No, it should be: why are you?

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,900
莱纳德  这些租赁的礼服早已被
Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,710
上百个满身臭汗的陌生人穿过
worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers.

43
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,930
我连沾到自己的汗都讨厌
I don't like my own sweat touching my skin,

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,480
陌生人的汗不是更要命吗
how do you think I feel about theirs?

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,930
试试这件吧
Why don't you slip this on?

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,050
就跟绞刑吏来送绞索一样
Said the hangman offering a noose.

47
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,830
虽然不如他租保龄球鞋时搞笑
Well, that wasn't as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes,

48
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,620
不过也相差无几了
but it was right up there.

49
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,940
好吧  木已成舟
Well, that's it.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,780
我的任命被撤销了
My orders have been rescinded.

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,260
我正式"去不成"太空了
I am officially "no go" to space.

52
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,420
我很遗憾  霍华德  不过老实说
I'm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you,

53
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,310
你去不成  我反倒松了一口气
I'm a little relieved you're not going.

54
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,450
为什么
Why?

55
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,010
拜托  送你上太空的火箭
Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket

56
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,400
可是俄国人在上世纪六十年代设计的
designed in the 1960s by the Russians.

57
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,770
是啊  那又如何
Yeah, so?

58
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,520
你可有过去百思买购物时
When was the last time you were at Best Buy

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,780
听别人说  "快看这个蓝光播放器
and you heard someone say, "ooh, check out this Blu-ray player,

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,920
是俄国制造的呢  肯定不错"的经验吗
it must be good, it was built in Russia"?

61
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,670
他们的技术也没那么糟啦
Well, their technology isn't that bad.

62
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,250
当你坐着联盟号太空舱返回地球时 
When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule,

63
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,730
你会以每小时500英里的速度自由落体
you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour,

64
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,360
唯一帮你减速的东西
and the only thing that slows you down

65
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,980
是你撞向地面的前一刻
is a little parachute that pops out

66
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,620
弹出的小小降落伞
right before you crash into the ground.

67
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,090
而设计这火箭的人  可是连飞鼠洛奇和
And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds

68
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,330
驯鹿布尔温克都抓不到的"聪明"俄国人呢
who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle.

69
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,330
飞鼠洛奇和驯鹿布尔温克
美国六十年代经典卡通片《飞鼠洛基冒险记》的主角

70
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,750
好吧  不管怎么说
All right, well, whatever.

71
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,060
我一点也不担心
I wasn't worried.

72
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,150
是吗
You weren't?

73
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,070
让我解释一下你和我的区别
Let me explain the difference between you and me.

74
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:29,120
你是《星际迷航》的看客
You watch <i>Star Trek</i>

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,420
而我是住客
I live it.

76
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,770
拜托  《星际迷航》可有过任何一集
Oh, please. I don't remember the episode of <i>Star Trek</i>

77
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,310
是讲一个没去成太空的家伙
where the guy never goes to space

78
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,720
在礼服店自吹自擂的故事啊
and brags about it in a tuxedo store.

79
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,350
随你怎么嘲笑我
Make all the jokes you want,

80
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,520
但我们之中  也就只有一个人足够勇敢
but there's only one of us here brave enough

81
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,060
差点真做了上太空的大业
to almost do what I almost did.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,210
这回好多了
Ah, much better.

83
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,390
你现在肯定热得要死吧
You must be burning up.

84
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,340
是有点  不过也比你们从那些裤子染上点
A little. But not more than your urethras will be

85
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,750
不知名的病菌  然后尿道灼热瘙痒来得强
after whatever's in those pants swims up them.

86
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,210
我将潇洒与卫生完美的结合起来了  不是吗
I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, don't I?

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,200
我看上去就像是闪电侠要结婚了
I look like the Flash about to get married.

88
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,280
天啊  废纸巾  废纸巾
Oh! A tissue! A tissue!

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,650
上帝啊
Oh, good Lord!

90
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,040
他要上哪去
Uh, where's he going?

91
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,400
他在车里准备了紧急消毒液
He keeps emergency Purell in the car.

92
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,940
钥匙给我 给我  给我
Keys! Keys! Keys!

93
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,890
-是你啊  -我进来之前
- Hey, you. - Before I come in,

94
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,260
得先告诉你  我可是有"气"而来哟
you should know, I have gas.

95
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,230
说起来  你还说过更烂的开场白呢
For the record, not your worst opening line.

96
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,130
来看吧  这瓶气是我用来让
Check it out. It's the gas I use

97
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,470
自由电子激光支持高电压的
in my free-electron laser to support high voltages.

98
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,980
但它还有个有趣的第二用途
But it also has an interesting secondary use.

99
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,120
给你  吸一口
Here. Breathe this in.

100
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,150
在我吸之前
B-Before I do it,

101
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,000
如果你是条子  你会告诉我的吧
if you're a cop you have to tell me, right?

102
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,130
-吸就好啦  -好吧
- Just try it. - Okay.

103
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,710
吸完后会...
What's it supposed to...

104
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,590
天啊  这太诡异了
Oh, my God, that's so freaky!

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,780
"你这个小气鬼"
You're a mean one

106
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,780
出自同名歌曲《You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch》

107
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,100
"圣诞怪杰先生"
Mr. Grinch.

108
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
好了好了  到我了  准备好没
Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?

109
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,800
莱纳德  我是你爹
Leonard, I am your father.

110
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,290
我这辈子从没这么被一个
I have never been more attracted to a woman

111
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
声音像男人的女人吸引过
who sounds like a man in my life.

112
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,320
你知道我们一直... 
Hey... you know how we've been...

113
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,190
进展得比较慢吧
taking things slow?

114
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,680
我最近一直在想...
Well, I've been thinking, and...

115
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,670
或许我准备好... 
maybe I'm ready to...

116
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,400
让进展加快...一点点啦
take things a little... faster.

117
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,380
太好了
Oh, great.

118
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,670
我向你保证  憋了四个月之后
And I promise, after waiting four months,

119
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,420
也就只能当"快枪手"了
fast is what you're gonna get.

120
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,070
不过有个问题
You know, just-just one thing.

121
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,470
我们现在关系那么融洽
Look, we're in a really great place right now,

122
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,700
我不想做出任何
and I don't want to do anything

123
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,470
把关系弄尴尬的事情
that will make stuff all weird again.

124
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,280
那我们就别让它变尴尬不得了
So we won't let it get weird.

125
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,000
行  我还得提个醒
Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up...

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,910
从我们上次"亲密"到现在这之间
mm, since the last time you saw me naked,

127
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,700
儿童节目《芝麻街》中的人物角色

128
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,700
我纹了个甜怪饼纹身
I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

129
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,570
你看到的时候  除了称赞"好炫"
The acceptable response"s when you see it

130
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,170
我不想听到其他废话
are "awesome" or nothing.

131
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,330
那我就说
What about...

132
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,890
我要甜饼
Cookies!

133
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,340
艾米
Amy?

134
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,590
艾米
Amy?

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,840
艾米
Amy?

136
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,970
七点  刚好准时
7:00, right on time.

137
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,670
这可不是什么"刚好"
It's not an accident.

138
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,930
人家在足足在门外等了二十分钟呢
I waited outside your door for 20 minutes.

139
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,380
晚餐马上就好
Well, dinner's almost ready.

140
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,630
我不得不说
I must say,

141
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,940
我真没想到你会选择在家里
I was surprised you chose to spend

142
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,700
度过我们的约会之夜
our date night in your apartment.

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,880
正如我提到的
As I mentioned,

144
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,890
帕萨迪纳市议会正在辩论加长行人过马路的时间
the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times,

145
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,670
而且  乐高专卖店午夜还会举行疯狂大甩卖
and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale.

146
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,230
任谁都觉得那样的约会更血脉喷张
You ask anyone, that's a hot date.

147
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,450
是挺诱人  不过今晚我准备了
Tempting choices, but I have something special

148
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,670
一些特别的东西
planned for tonight.

149
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,010
有什么能比
What can be more special than

150
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,670
在去买乐高夺宝奇兵模型的路上
having an adequate amount of time to cross the street

151
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,910
能有充足时间过马路更特别啊
on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?

152
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,040
鉴于我们的朋友  关系都正在向前发展
With our friends moving forward in their relationships,

153
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,790
我决定我们的关系也该更进一步了
I've decided that we should make progress in ours as well.

154
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,610
老天哪
Oh, dear Lord.

155
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,760
两年前我们还不认识对方呢
Two years ago, we didn't even know each other,

156
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,890
现在我们就"夜晚时分你家见"了
and now I'm in your apartment after dark.

157
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,330
这关系进展得还不够快吗
How much faster can this thing go?

158
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,000
我早有预感你会不同意
I had a feeling you'd be reluctant,

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,220
所以我准备要使出我
which is why I'm going to dip

160
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,270
神经生物学版的锦囊妙计了
into my neurobiological bag of tricks.

161
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,680
你那些猴子主意最好玩了  挖吧
Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away.

162
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,530
我设计了一个实验
I have devised an experiment

163
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,860
我相信这能让你
that I believe will increase your feelings for me

164
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,410
加快对我产生感情
in an accelerated time frame.

165
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,800
你准备怎么做呢
And how do you propose to do that?

166
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
希望你不是想着
Uh, hope you're not thinking

167
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,140
用迷幻药来对我进行思想控制
about some sort of LSD thought control.

168
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,800
因为我只喜欢一种迷药  此药名"知识"
Because there's only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys,

169
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,380
"唯知识能令我着迷"
and that's called school.

170
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,590
情感的依赖是随着人类生长而诞生的
Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up.

171
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,640
以你来说  你依恋母亲  超能英雄等等
In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera.

172
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,040
我准备尝试一个实验
I'm going to attempt an experiment that

173
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,610
让你将这些情感转移到我身上
will get you to transfer those feelings to me.

174
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,390
看来今晚的菜
Well, seems what's on the menu tonight

175
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,140
只有"胡言乱语"和"胡说八道"呢
is malarkey with a big side of poppycock.

176
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,050
试了才知道
We'll see.

177
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,780
我们先听一首浪漫的晚餐音乐  好吗
Let's start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?

178
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,240
超级玛丽的主题曲
Super Mario Bros.theme?

179
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,260
没错
Yes.

180
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,150
我明白你在干什么了
I see what you're doing.

181
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:16,700
德国心理学家  首先设计了测量机械学习和记忆的实验方法
证实了记忆是基于联想

182
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,360
你想如法炮制艾宾豪斯的方法
You're attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus

183
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,700
从潜意识勾起我玩这个游戏时的记忆
by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game--

184
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,850
也就是我儿时那最快乐的六百个小时
admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood...

185
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,520
不过这是没用的
 ...but it won't work.

186
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,290
好吧  但也不影响我们享用晚餐
Fine. There's no reason we still can't have a lovely dinner.

187
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,660
你先就坐吧
Why don't you have a seat.

188
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,710
我给你倒点饮料喝吧
May I offer you something to drink?

189
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,280
你知道我不喝饮料
You know I don't drink.

190
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,630
这个也不喝吗
Not even...

191
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,010
草莓速溶奶
strawberry Quik?

192
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,750
我超爱草莓速溶奶
I love strawberry Quik.

193
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,950
我最喜欢的粉色液体
It's my favorite pink fluid,

194
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,810
比佩托比斯摩[粉色液体胃药]略胜一筹
narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol.

195
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,420
我知道
Oh, I know.

196
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,110
我觉得这个正好搭配
I think it will go nicely

197
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,790
我特意准备的
with what I have prepared...

198
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,100
晚餐
for dinner.

199
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,060
意粉  里面还加了热狗切片
Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!

200
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,350
跟以前你妈妈做的一样
Just like your mommy used to make.

201
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,210
大餐啊大餐
Oh... yummy, yummy!

202
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,720
我们以后要经常这样约会
We should do this more often.

203
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,840
糟糕
Uh-oh.

204
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,400
对不起  我错了
I'm sorry. I did,

205
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,310
我太过分了  我不是故意的
I crossed a line. I didn't mean to!

206
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,810
有谁会在做爱的时候说这样的话啊
Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?!

207
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,120
我不知道  不自觉就说出口了
I don't know, it just came out.

208
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,550
很多人在做爱期间都会说奇怪的话嘛
People say weird things during sex all the time.

209
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,880
可没人会说这个啊
Okay, well, they sure as hell don't say that.

210
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,190
-高潮时刻  情不自禁嘛  -放屁
- It was the heat of the moment. - No,

211
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,120
高潮时刻应该是说"对  太爽了"
the heat of the moment is, "Ooh, yeah, just like that,"

212
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,070
而不是说"你愿意嫁给我吗"
not "will you marry me?"

213
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,400
对不起
I'm sorry.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,970
再给我一次机会吧
Just-just give me another chance.

215
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,540
好让你下次能有机会在滚床单时说
Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go,

216
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,930
"宝贝  想去看看
"Hey, baby, want to go look for houses

217
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,960
在好学校学区里的房子吗"
in neighborhoods with good schools?"

218
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,670
我还是那句话  对不起
Again, I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,050
你也知道  霍华德和伯纳黛特要结婚了
You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married,

220
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,980
我被这股结婚热感染了
I got caught up in a little wedding fever.

221
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,060
我收回那句话
I take it back.

222
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,380
这种话覆水难收啊
You can't take something like that back.

223
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,160
我们现在该如何是好
I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?

224
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,960
说不定将来  某天回想起
Okay, at some point, we'll look back

225
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,890
会觉得这其实挺搞笑的啊
and this is going to be a funny story.

226
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,240
我们现在就可以当笑话看嘛
Why don't we just start doing that now?

227
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,300
-你不是吧  -我是说真的
- You're kidding. - No.

228
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,510
你还记不记得
Hey, do you remember...

229
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,070
我在床上向你求婚的那件事啊
 ...that time when I proposed to you in bed?

230
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,800
你当时一脸惊讶  说"你说毛呢"
And you were all, like, "What are <i>you</i> doing?"

231
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,820
真是笑死人了
That was so funny.

232
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,710
太好笑了
So funny.

233
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,430
一点都不好笑
It's not funny.

234
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,730
让笑点再酝酿一会
Give it a minute.

235
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,160
嘴角是不是要扬起微笑啦
Is that a little smile I see there?

236
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,070
我还是闪吧
I should go.

237
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,440
我刚刚在想
Hey, I was thinking.

238
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,630
我们结婚时的第一支舞蹈
For our first dance at the wedding,

239
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,860
我们学电影《辣身舞》里的最后那支舞怎么样
what if we learn the final number from <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

240
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,650
-你说笑的吧  -说真的
- You're kidding. - No,

241
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,990
来嘛
come on.

242
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,450
那该有多酷啊
How cool would that be?

243
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,820
我奔向你的臂弯
Me running into your arms...

244
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,520
你把我举在空中
you lifting me up into the air.

245
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,360
某人心情不错呀
Oh, you're in a good mood.

246
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
当然啦  有什么好不开心的
Yeah, well, why wouldn't I be?

247
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,230
我就要迎娶我的梦中情人了
You know, I'm marrying the girl of my dreams,

248
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,960
而且我也终于说服我妈
and I finally got my mother to agree

249
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,500
不跟着咱们去度蜜月了
not to come on our honeymoon.

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,310
是航空航天局打来的
Oh, it's NASA.

251
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:17,470
稍等
Oh, hang on.

252
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,690
我是沃罗威茨
Wolowitz.

253
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,630
戴夫  怎么了
Oh! Hi, Dave. What's up?

254
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,880
你没开玩笑吧  真的吗
No kidding. Really?

255
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,560
这  这真是太好了
Well, that's...great news.

256
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,580
天大的好消息
Great, great news.

257
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,000
好的  我会查邮件的
All right, I'll watch my e-mail for the details.

258
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
好的  回头聊
Okay, talk soon.

259
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,720
什么天大的好消息呀
What's so great?

260
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,400
看来我还是要上太空了
It looks like I'm going into space after all.

261
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,210
华仔  这太棒了
Oh, Howie, that's wonderful!

262
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,210
是挺棒
Uh-huh, wonderful.

263
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:05,682
怎么回事  他们不是把你的任务取消了吗
What happened? I thought they canceled your mission.

264
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:06,542
是取消了
Th-They did.

265
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:11,222
可是航空航天局很想把我的望远镜装上太空站
But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station,

266
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:14,282
所以他们要让我提前升空
so they're putting me on an earlier launch.

267
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:18,142
-什么时候  -下周五
- When?  - A...week from Friday.

268
00:12:18,522 --> 00:12:21,202
什么  可咱们的婚礼就在那个周日呀
What? We're getting married that Sunday.

269
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,542
说的没错
You're right!

270
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,522
我  我不能去太空
I-I can't go to space.

271
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,372
我要结婚
I have to get married,

272
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:28,922
这个理由没人能反驳
and no one can say that's not a good reason.

273
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,112
我这就打回给他
I'll call him back.

274
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:35,312
等一下  我不想成为阻碍你的那个人
Wait. I don't want to be the one who stands in your way.

275
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,132
可惜  你已经是了  米已成炊了
Well, too bad, you already did. It's a done deal.

276
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,452
但是没关系  我原谅你
Oh, well. But I forgive you.

277
00:12:39,302 --> 00:12:41,592
不行  我不想这么开始咱们的婚姻
No. That's not how I want to start our marriage,

278
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:43,042
我怎么能一上来就毁掉你的梦想呢
killing your dream?

279
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,932
等你回来咱们再举办婚礼
We'll have the wedding when you get back.

280
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:49,252
可是我们已经做好计划而且喜帖都发了呀
But wh-what about all the plans and the guests?

281
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,602
打电话给大家取消就是了
We'll call them.

282
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,492
虽然我老爸会因为损失了酒席押金
Although my dad's gonna go a little nutso

283
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:54,522
而不是太爽
over losing his deposits.

284
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:58,382
没错  他一定会的
You're right, he is!

285
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:00,752
你爸会气疯的
Your dad's gonna be furious.

286
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:03,332
他不可能会同意我们延迟婚礼
There's no way he's gonna let us postpone this wedding.

287
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,722
至少咱们努力过了
Well, we tried.

288
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,242
我去跟他谈
I'll talk to him.

289
00:13:07,242 --> 00:13:08,972
他不会拒绝他的宝贝女儿的
He won't say no to his little girl.

290
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:12,762
不  应该我去跟他谈
No! I-I should talk to him,

291
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:14,112
来场男人跟男人间的对话
man to man.

292
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:15,742
但是  华仔  我老爸很凶的
But, Howie, my dad can be a bully.

293
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:18,032
他会逼你  不让你上太空的
He's gonna make you cancel your space flight.

294
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,322
这样最好...
We can only hope...

295
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:20,902
是别发生啦
that he doesn't.

296
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,710
象挪到二层的
Bishop to queen four,

297
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,520
四号皇后
level two.

298
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,450
将军
Check.

299
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,730
谢尔顿
Sheldon...

300
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,900
马吃掉象
knight takes bishop.

301
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,600
你没事吧
You all right?

302
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,570
我没事
I'm fine.

303
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,820
真的吗
Are you?

304
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,860
你把你的皇后暴露在敌军之中
You left your queen exposed from above,

305
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,650
把你的马困在了角落里
you trapped your knight in the corner,

306
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,680
还不停地一边叹气一边说"为什么是我"
and you keep sighing and saying, "Why me?"

307
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,490
好吧
Very well.

308
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,390
我能问你一个关于女人的问题吗
Can I ask you a question about women?

309
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,610
我们去年不是买了那本书给你嘛
We got you that book last year.

310
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,230
那里面的东西还不够全面吗
Wasn't everything in there?

311
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,900
不是  我跟艾米有点感情问题
No, I'm having a relationship problem with Amy.

312
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,470
顺便说一句  我看完那本书就做噩梦
And by the way, that book gave me nightmares.

313
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,850
我跟佩妮最近也闹得很僵
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

314
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,620
也许这样能让你觉得好受点
I screwed things up pretty good with Penny.

315
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,850
你看咱俩现在  莱纳德
Look at us, Leonard...

316
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,430
都会像普通的男人一样
engaging in the social convention of

317
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,050
聚在一起抱怨自己家的女人了
men bellyaching about their ol' ladies.

318
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,710
是啊
I guess we are.

319
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,760
那说说吧  你们怎么了
So, what's going on?

320
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,400
信不信由你
Believe it or not,

321
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,910
艾米开始想尽办法哄我开心
Amy has embarked on a campaign

322
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,150
就为了增进
to increase my feelings for her

323
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,210
我对她的感情
by making me happy.

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,720
我深表同情  你肯定觉得"很不好受"
I'm sorry, that must be very difficult for you.

325
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,740
简直糟透了
It's awful.

326
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,800
今早  她替我打点好一切
This morning, she arranged for me

327
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,820
让我当一天全美铁路客运公司的小售票员
to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day.

328
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,920
通常  这种机会只提供给小孩子
It-It's usually only open to children.

329
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,700
她逼人家为我破例了
She got them to make an exception.

330
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,570
她真无耻
Shame on her.

331
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,990
他们让我吹哨子了  莱纳德
They let me blow the whistle, Leonard.

332
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,710
她还真有两下子
She's good.

333
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,940
就是啊  而且事态愈发严重了
I know. And it gets worse.

334
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,840
她的努力已经开始让我
Her efforts are causing me

335
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,990
在不恰当的时候
to have affectionate feelings for her

336
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,390
对她想入非非了
at inappropriate times.

337
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,280
你是指在床上或是在你冲凉的时候吗
You mean, like in bed or in the shower?

338
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,510
才不是呢
No!

339
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,800
你能别再引用那本万恶淫书中的句子了吗
Would you please stop referencing that infernal book?

340
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,920
比如说  今天早上
For example, this morning,

341
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,160
我正在计算真空条件下虚粒子的
I was calculating the random motion

342
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
无规则运动
of virtual particles in a vacuum,

343
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,070
突然间那些虚粒子
when suddenly the particles morphed

344
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,380
变形成了艾米的头皮屑
into an image of Amy's dandruff...

345
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,510
慢慢地从她的头上倾泻而下
...gently cascading down onto her pale,

346
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,730
落在她苍白又微微隆起的肩膀上
slightly hunched shoulders.

347
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,030
这个女巫到底对我下了什么药啊  莱纳德
What has that vixen done to me, Leonard?

348
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,550
我怎么才能停止这一切呀
And how do I make it stop?

349
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,820
如果你俩有肉体关系的话
Well, if you had a physical relationship,

350
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,850
我会建议你在跟她亲热的过程中求婚
I'd say propose during sex.

351
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,770
绝对一招毙命  性趣全无
Turns out that's a real mood killer.

352
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,520
-我猜咱俩现在聊得是你咯  -没错
- I assume we're talking about you now?  - Yeah.

353
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,840
所以这种社交场合就是这样的吗
So, that's how this works?

354
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,190
我抱怨几句  然后你再接着抱怨几句
I complain, and then you complain,

355
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,380
可大家都没什么解决办法
and no one offers any solutions?

356
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,400
基本上就是这样
Pretty much.

357
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,330
怪不得女人们开始占上风了呢
Well, no wonder the women are winning.

358
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,990
罗森考斯基先生  你在忙吗
Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?

359
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,810
我只是在看些老照片  进来吧
Oh, just looking at some old pictures. Come on in.

360
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,340
是家庭照片  还是...
Family pictures, or...?

361
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,610
天哪  那是个死人
H-Holy crap, that's a dead person.

362
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,720
我退休前最后一桩谋杀案
Last murder case before I retired.

363
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,790
这里有多少具死尸
How many bodies do you see there?

364
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,910
好好数
Careful,

365
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,890
这个问题很有难度
it's a trick question.

366
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,380
我不确定
I'm not sure.

367
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,860
算了  你也猜不到
Nah, you'll never get it.

368
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,940
是来自同一尸体的碎块
It's a fraction.

369
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,870
意想不到啊
How about that.

370
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,160
是这样的  先生
Anyway, sir,

371
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,930
我有点事想找你谈谈
I need to talk to you about something.

372
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,290
要吃核桃吗
Walnut?

373
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,020
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you.

374
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,160
我对核桃过敏
 I'm allergic.

375
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,510
好的
Oh, sure.

376
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,910
我搭档也过敏
My partner used to have that.

377
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,610
他已经死了
He's dead now.

378
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,560
死于坚果吗[疯子]
From nuts?

379
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,350
不是  被他老婆枪杀的
Nah, his wife shot him.

380
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,860
不过她是疯子  所以某种意义上来说...
But she was nuts, so in a way...

381
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,370
真是好故事
Nice story.

382
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,420
总之
Anyway,

383
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,750
我想跟你谈谈的原因是
the reason I wanted to talk to you is

384
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,720
宇航局把我上太空站的发射提前了
NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station.

385
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,310
-那又如何  -那就是说
- Yeah, so? - So...

386
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:21,820
发射日期跟我娶你女儿的日期有冲突
the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter.

387
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,410
我知道你想说什么
Now, I know what you're going to say--

388
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,280
我已对伯纳黛特和您家作出承诺
I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family

389
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,540
我鼓起万般勇气来到这里
and I've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here

390
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,320
提出延期的要求实在是太过分了
and demanding that we postpone this thing.

391
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
所以  我明白了也理解了
Well, message heard and understood.

392
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,710
取消去太空站的任务  打扰了
Mission canceled. Thank you.

393
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,470
你要去哪
Where are you going?

394
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,090
抱歉
I'm sorry.

395
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,910
我可以离开了吗
May I be excused?

396
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,070
不可以
No, you may not.

397
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,530
我来告诉你
Let me tell you something.

398
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,240
我第一次见到你时
When I first met you...

399
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,060
你就站在那里听吗
You just gonna stand there?

400
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,850
抱歉  我不知道  是要...
I'm sorry, I didn't know, is this going to...

401
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,860
好的  我坐下
Well, I should sit...

402
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,650
我能坐吗...我坐下就是
May I be seat... Well, I'll just sit.

403
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,060
我第一次见到你时
When I first met you,

404
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,540
很不喜欢你
I didn't like you.

405
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,750
我知道  先生
I'm aware of that, sir.

406
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,140
跟你相处过一段时间后
But then you and I had some time together.

407
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,540
还是不喜欢你
It did not get better.

408
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,350
好吧
Right, right.

409
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:14,610
你那愚蠢的披头士发型
That silly Beatle haircut

410
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,900
骑一辆红色小摩托
and...you riding around on a red Vespa,

411
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,570
还跟你妈妈一起住
and you're still living at home with your mother.

412
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,550
老实说  我觉得伯纳黛特选择你
To be honest, I thought Bernadette chose you

413
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,140
是为了惩罚我
to punish me.

414
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,580
然后我听到你要当宇航员的事
But then I heard about your astronaut thing,

415
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,170
我才意识到
and I realized

416
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,800
我过于草率的判断你了
I judged you too fast.

417
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,840
也许你就是最适合我女儿的白马王子
Maybe you are the right guy for my little girl.

418
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,200
我就是  而且你也知道的
Oh, I am. And just so you know,

419
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,470
即使我不去太空了  我也依旧是宇航员
I'd still be an astronaut, even if I didn't go to space.

420
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:44,800
我有身份认证卡和宇航局的高尔夫衫
 I've got an I.D. card and a NASA golf shirt.

421
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,730
不不  你一定得去
No, no, you got to go.

422
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,160
不应该放弃这样的一个机会
You can't turn down an opportunity like this.

423
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,440
那婚礼怎么办
B-But what about the wedding

424
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,080
还有你为婚宴投下去的钱怎么办
and all the money you put down for the reception?

425
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,800
这事我烦恼就好
You let me worry about that.

426
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,770
你安心去那个空间站
You go up to that space station,

427
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,870
让我为你骄傲
and you make me proud.

428
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,090
好吧
Um, okay.

429
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,980
你觉得这有什么问题吗
You got a problem with that?

430
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,240
好吧  我跟你说老实话
All right, look, I'm gonna level with you.

431
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,820
我很害怕进入太空
I'm terrified about going into space.

432
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,010
要是我回不来怎么办
What if I don't make it back?

433
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,120
会没事的  女婿
It's gonna be okay, son.

434
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,420
你真的这么想吗
You really think so?

435
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,910
当然
Of course.

436
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,650
伯纳黛特那么漂亮
A pretty girl like Bernadette...

437
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,200
肯定会找到新归宿
she'll find a new guy.

438
00:19:43,072 --> 00:19:44,182
-去上班吗  -对
- Off to work?  - Yeah.

439
00:19:45,262 --> 00:19:46,652
祝你晚上过得愉快
Have a nice night.

440
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:48,212
你也是
Okay, you, too.

441
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:50,642
佩妮  等等
Penny, just, wait.

442
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:52,562
我一直在想那天
I've been thinking about what I said

443
00:19:52,562 --> 00:19:54,382
我们上床时我说过的话
when we were in bed the other night.

444
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:56,572
我也一直在想
Yeah, I've been thinking about it, too.

445
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,792
你一直都还没回答我呢
I noticed you never answered me.

446
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:01,612
没错
You're right.

447
00:20:07,402 --> 00:20:08,842
答案是不
No.

448
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:13,892
-继续  那我们还是恋人吗  -是啊
- Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?  - Yep.

449
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:17,042
-还在因为我求婚而尴尬吗  -是啊
- Is it still weird 'cause I proposed? - Yep.

450
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:19,722
我还有几个问题要问
 I have a couple more quick questions.
