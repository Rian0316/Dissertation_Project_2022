1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,000
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,700
one was careless...

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,200
you put a woman into a coma.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,500
Surely that arouses some kind of emotion.

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Well, it doesn't.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,900
You and I are finished.

7
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,000
One said goodbye...

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,100
I'm so tired of feeling like a failure.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,500
One almost lost it...

10
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,900
your wife didn't kill herself because I wrote a note.

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,700
She killed herself because of what
she did to that poor baby.

12
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,100
And one got exactly

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,400
what she deserved.

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,800
Gabrielle was waiting for her next great idea.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Her first great idea came when she was 15,

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
after her stepfather paid her a late-night visit.

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,700
She bought a bus ticket to New York the very next day.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,400
Her next occurred five years later when she decided
to seduce a famous fashion photographer.

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,400
One week later, she began her career as a runway model,

20
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,000
which soon led to her next great idea --

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,600
her decision to marry Carlos Solis.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,400
Before she knew it, she had jumped off
the runway and moved to the suburbs.

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,500
Her most recent great idea was born out
of her boredom with her new life.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,300
That's how she came to start an affair
with her teenage gardener,

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,200
which was cut short by a tragic accident,

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,000
so once again, Gabrielle was in need of a great idea.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
Mrs. Solis, I know you're worried,
but it's going to take time.

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Hmm?

29
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,200
What is?

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
You look sad.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
I assume you're thinking about your mother-in-law.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,900
Oh, no.

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,600
So, uh, what were you thinking about?

34
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
My life.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,900
It hasn't turned out like I thought it would.

36
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,200
Oh, honey.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, no, I-I know I shouldn't complain.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,000
It's just there's something missing,
and I don't know what it is.

39
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,700
Do you ever feel that way?

40
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,000
Mm, no.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
When I go home at night, I sleep like a baby,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,900
'cause I know I did something that
day that helped people.

43
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,600
That must be a nice feeling.

44
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,000
Hmm. It is.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,700
Of course, there's times I wish
I didn't have to work so hard.

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,700
We've got a real nursing shortage here,
and they keep cutting our budget and --

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,800
Attention, all available personnel --

48
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,500
code blue, stat, room 214.

49
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,400
Excuse me.

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
Attention, all available personnel --

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,200
code blue, stat, room 214.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Damn it, get a doctor in here! I don't have an airway.

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,300
No time. I have to intubate.

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,300
Mr. Getz? Mr. Getz, listen.

55
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,900
You're not dying on me, okay?

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,200
This tube is to help you breathe.

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,900
I need you to be brave now.

58
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,300
It was then that Gabrielle got her next great idea.

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,600
She decided to throw the first annual Sacred Heart charity
fashion show to raise money for more nursing staff.

60
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
Gabby, Gabby, I can't do it.

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,800
I cannot walk down a runway in one of these dresses.

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,500
They all make me look so fat.

63
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,100
Please get someone to take my place. Please.

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
- Betty, listen to me.
- No, no, please --

65
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,100
listen, Betty, okay?

66
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,900
You're not quitting on me now.

67
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,000
We're going to find you a gown.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's going to be black and slimming,
and you're going to look great.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,700
I need you to be brave now.

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,400
Okay.

71
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,500
And that night, when she went to bed,
Gabrielle slept like a baby.

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,400
Episode 8 : Suspicious Minds

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,400
News of the fashion show spread quickly on Wisteria Lane.

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Though the event was for charity,

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,500
Gabrielle soon discovered when it
came to the latest fashions,

76
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,300
women are seldom charitable.

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,400
No one knew this better than Edie Britt.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,200
She understood that treachery never goes out of style.

79
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,600
& nbsp;

80
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,900
Susan.

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,700
Give me the dress.

82
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,100
I gave it a shot.

83
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,000
Hmm.

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,900
Hi, Helen.

85
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,500
Hi.

86
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,600
How's the dress fitting?

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Great. Maybe it could be taken
out in the shoulder a little.

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,500
Sure, no problem.

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,800
There you go.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,500
You know, Gabrielle, I-I never thanked you properly.

91
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,900
For what?

92
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,600
For what you did for my son.

93
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,500
It was so nice of you to hire John as your gardener.

94
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,500
Believe me, it's been my pleasure.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
How's he doing?

96
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,100
Good. Good.

97
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,200
I hear he's dating Danielle Van De Kamp.

98
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,200
Oh, for now. I think it's just a matter of
time before they break up for good.

99
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,400
What's wrong?

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,300
Oh, she just seems to want much more of
a relationship than he does.

101
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,700
You remember what it was like dating teenage boys.

102
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,000
V aguely.

103
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,500
No, you tell that son of a bitch Tanaka
that if he doesn't call me in an hour,

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm going to go down to his office,
find him, and kick his ass.

106
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,000
Ladies.

107
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,600
Trouble at work?

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,700
I don't know what his problem is.

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
He's making money left and right.

110
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
I just wish he'd relax.

111
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,100
Crap, crap, crap.

112
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,700
I'm telling you, all of the good dresses are taken.

113
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,700
Now what the hell am I supposed to wear?

114
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,100
Well, Mrs. Huber never showed up.

115
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,800
Why don't you wear this one?

116
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,700
This is an old lady dress.

117
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,900
You won't even be able to see my body.

118
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,800
That is so like you, Edie.
You're always thinking of others.

119
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,600
So why isn't Mrs. Huber here?

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,200
Last I heard, she went to visit her sister.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I just can't believe that Martha
would agree to wear this.

122
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,700
She always said she'd never
be caught dead in black.

123
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,500
Sadly for Mrs. Huber,

124
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,800
this was no longer the case.

125
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,100
Hey, mom.

126
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,000
Julie, you'll never guess who you got a letter from.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,600
Zach. Isn't that weird --him writing you?

128
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,900
Yeah.

129
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,900
Well, open. Open, open, open.

130
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
He -- he could have said something about Dana.

131
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,300
I'll read it later.

132
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,400
Later? What's wrong with now?

133
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,900
I've got tons of homework, mom.

134
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Julie, what's going on?

135
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,100
This isn't the first letter I've gotten from Zach.

136
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,300
We've been writing each other
the last couple of weeks.

137
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Are you mad?

138
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,100
No.

139
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,900
Just when I was your age, my pen pal lived on
a farm in Ohio, not in a mental institution.

140
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,500
You know, that letter is one notch above prison mail.

141
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Zach's not crazy.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,400
He's just upset over his mom, and his dad
doesn't even seem to care.

143
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,900
He just needs a friend.

144
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,100
I packed the diapers,

145
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm getting the juice boxes and the carrot sticks --

146
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,400
sunscreen?

147
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
Got it.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,400
I go pick up the boys, we hit the park,

149
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,900
and that should give you a good couple of hours.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,500
Enjoy the vacation.

151
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
What?

152
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,200
While you're gone, I'll be here paying bills
and sorting laundry and cooking dinner,

153
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,700
so what part of that sounds like a vacation?

154
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Okay, right, you know what?
We'll pick up dinner.

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,600
and you just take a hot bath, relax, recharge.

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
& nbsp;

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,100
Okay, I get it.

158
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,200
It's going to take more than a hot bath to recharge,

159
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
but, uh, don't forget, I'm here all week.

160
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Then what?

161
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,200
And then we go back to normal?

162
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,100
Tom, our last version of normal had me popping pills.

163
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,800
Normal is a bad, bad plan.

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,700
Okay, so we'll put our heads together,
and we'll come up with a solution.

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,000
I think we need to hire a nanny full-time.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,300
That's just such a big, big commitment.

167
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,200
I know, and I know we can't afford it,

168
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,200
and I know everything that's happened is my fault,

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,500
but if I don't get some help,

170
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,300
there's an excellent chance I will lose my mind.

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,000
Okay, well, then, we have to make it work.

172
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,500
Next up, the 200-meter freestyle.

173
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,600
It's just not right.

174
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,200
What?

175
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,000
A woman is in a coma because of Andrew,
and there he is, happy as a clam.

176
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,200
Well, we grounded him, we took
away the tv in his room.

177
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,900
How many more ways you want to punish him?

178
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
Swimmers, take your marks.

179
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,000
I think we should make him quit the swim team.

180
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,800
Bree, this is the one thing in his
life that he's passionate about.

181
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,600
Well, maybe if we take it away from him,
then he'll start to understand what he did.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
He has not shown an ounce of
remorse since the accident.

183
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Of course he feels bad.

184
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,900
He's just, you know, keeping up a facade.

185
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
Well, he's doing a fabulous job.

186
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Look, if we take him off the swim team,

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,100
he'll lose his shot at an athletic scholarship,

188
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
and then he's never going to forgive us.

189
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Well, if it ensures he grows up with some trace of
humanity, then that's a risk I am willing to take.

190
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,800
Well, I'm not.

191
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
That's because you just don't
love him as much as I do.

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,600
Well, isn't that nice?

193
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
It's just a fact. I'm his mother.

194
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,000
He lived inside of me.

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,900
He hung out in your womb for a few
months back in the '80s.

196
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,200
Since then, I have grown to love
him just as much as you.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,100
What just happened?

198
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,500
That kid you both love so much just won the race.

199
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,500
John.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,800
My mom said you needed volunteers, so I volunteered.

201
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
Oh.

202
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Finally got the charity bug?

203
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,100
You sound surprised.

204
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,200
No, not really.

205
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,100
You were always a giver.

206
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,900
Would you knock it off?

207
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,000
My mom's right over there.

208
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,200
Have a seat.

209
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,800
You can start by helping us alphabetize
the donation cards.

210
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,300
So word on the street is you and
Danielle might break up.

211
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,400
Maybe. I don't know.

212
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Is that because of me?

213
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,500
Not everything is about you.

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,000
Would you stop that?

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
Have you been thinking about me?

216
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
No.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,100
Really?

218
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,500
Could have fooled me.

219
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,400
Hey, do you need any help?

220
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,300
Please. Just pull up a chair.

221
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Oh, gosh.

222
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,600
That's okay. I got it.

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,300
Ow! Oh!

224
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Susan, hi.

225
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,700
Do you want to help with the seating cards?

226
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,300
Sure. Do you want to tell me why you had your
foot in John Rowland's crotch yesterday?

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,200
Oh, that.

228
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,500
Uh, he was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking,

229
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,400
and from your angle, it must have looked a little weird.

230
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,900
You're sleeping with him, aren't you?

231
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,500
Okay.

232
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,600
Yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody.

233
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,600
Gabrielle, he's in high school, and
it's illegal, and you're married.

234
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,500
If Carlos found out, this would kill him.

235
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,900
It's just sex. It's totally harmless.

236
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
How can you call something like this harmless?

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,600
After everything you know about
what I went through with Karl?

238
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,300
This isn't about you.

239
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,200
Yes, it is.

240
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,700
It's about me and about every other person who
was screwed over by somebody they loved.

241
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,500
When Karl ran off with Brandi, you saw
what a basket case I was.

242
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,300
I was crying, I-I was tearing up his clothes.
I couldn't get out of bed all day.

243
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,900
You were right there. How could you do the same thing?

244
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,500
Okay, how can you compare me to Karl? That's not fair.

245
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,400
You have no idea what my life is like.

246
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,600
Well, why don't you enlighten me?

247
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,100
You're beautiful, you have more
money than you can spend,

248
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,700
and you have a husband who adores you.

249
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,100
No, he doesn't adore me.

250
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
He adores having me.

251
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,300
That's a rationalization, and you know it.

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
See you at the show.

253
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,200
Okay, honey. There you go.

254
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,000
How many nannies did you interview?

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,700
10. 10, each one more incompetent than the last.

256
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,800
One actually asked me --

257
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,400
there you go --

258
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,700
if she was expected to change diapers.

259
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,400
Good nannies are so hard to find.

260
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,800
Yeah, that's why I was hoping to take
advantage of your expertise.

261
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,300
Oh, lord. What do you want me to do?

262
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,500
All your rich friends have nannies -- A-list nannies.

263
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,700
I need to catch one --

264
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,800
here you go --

265
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,000
without their bosses.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
Why?

267
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
So I can poach me one.

268
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:33,700
Lynette --

269
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,700
look, at my old job, we didn't wait
for good people to come to us.

270
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,200
We went out and raided other companies.

271
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,800
I don't see why it should be different
when you're hiring a nanny.

272
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,700
I understand that good help is hard to find, but
stealing a family's nanny is so unseemly.

273
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,100
I'm not twisting anyone's arm.

274
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,400
If I make a better offer, why shouldn't
a qualified person reap the benefits?

275
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,000
So come on.

276
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,700
Where can I score some high-grade nanny?

277
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,700
Hey, Mrs. Solis.

278
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,500
I have some awesome news.

279
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,500
I have some not-so-awesome news, so you go first.

280
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,700
Broke it off with Danielle.

281
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,400
I passed her a note during French class.

282
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,000
So we can be together.

283
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,600
John, your timing is impeccable.

284
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,400
What do you mean?

285
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,000
Susan Mayer saw us last night,
and she knows everything.

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,300
Since the accident, Bree had started to worry her son's
sense of morality was going up in smoke.

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,800
She was right to be concerned.

288
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,800
Andrew?

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,300
Can I come in?

290
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,800
Uh, yeah, just a sec.

291
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
Hey.

292
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,300
What's up?

293
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,800
Why are you smiling?

294
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Um, it's just a...

295
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,500
joke that I heard.

296
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,200
Oh. What was it about?

297
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Well, it's kind of dirty, mom.

298
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,700
Charming.

299
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,200
What I was wondering is if you've bothered to
spend any time reflecting on the reasons

300
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,700
that you've been grounded and all the pain

301
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,800
that you've caused the Solis family.

302
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,500
Yeah, I-I totally get how my actions have
affected, like, everything else.

303
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,200
Really?

304
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,900
Uh-huh.

305
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,500
I-I mean, you know, like when I
do something like I did,

306
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
and, you know, you got to do something like you did,

307
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,100
which is --which is, you know, it's -- it's cool,

308
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,600
because, um... then everything just kind
of balances itself out and --

309
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,900
and goes all smooth again, you know?

310
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,300
No, I don't.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,900
What's that smell?

312
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,300
Have you been smoking marijuana?

313
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
No, of course not.

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,900
You are strung out.

315
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
No. No, no, no, mom.

316
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Excuse me.

317
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,600
What's that?

318
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,300
It's the container you'll be urinating into. Come on.

319
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:30,200
Ow, ow. Ow, that hurts.

320
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,100
Dr. Sicher. What are you doing here?

321
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,700
Mr. Young, I --

322
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,200
I didn't want to upset you by
telling you over the phone.

323
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,600
What is it?

324
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,000
Zach is missing from Silvercrest.

325
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
It happened yesterday evening.

326
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,300
We think it happened during the shift change.

327
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I know this is difficult to hear.

328
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,900
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, well, it's, uh... just been one of those days.

330
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,200
I still don't get why you're not
with Danielle anymore.

331
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
She looked so slutty at Ray's party.

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,500
She's not my type, I guess.

333
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
What, oh, you still hung upon your
mysterious married lady?

334
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,400
What is it with her?

335
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,700
Besides the obvious, of course.

336
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,000
We talk about real stuff, you know?

337
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
She doesn't treat me like some lame yard boy.

338
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500
But you are a lame yard boy.

339
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,400
It's all messed up now anyway.

340
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,300
Her friend found out about us.

341
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,600
If it gets out, her husband's going to kill me.

342
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,300
Huh. But on the upside, your social status
at school is going to explode

343
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,400
when people find out you're doing a hot housewife.

344
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,300
Shut up, dude.

345
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,600
Please explain to me how he could just walk out.

346
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,300
With the money that I pay you people,
I think you could afford a pad lock.

347
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,100
With all due respect, we are not a high-security facility,

348
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,500
and you have restricted our ability to treat Zach.

349
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,900
What the hell does that mean?

350
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,700
You've insisted we medicate him
without psycho therapy.

351
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,700
That is a recipe for disaster.

352
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,400
Zach is a troubled young man,

353
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,500
and he's getting progressively worse.

354
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,400
Hungry?

355
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,700
I'm starving.

356
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,300
Bree had given Lynette the low
down on Valley View Park.

357
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,100
It was a gathering place for up scale
nannies and their young charges.

358
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,700
It was Lynette's first time there, and she was
determined not to go home alone.

359
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,400
Of course, Lynette had high standards,

360
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,000
so making a connection...

361
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,900
wasn't easy.

362
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:14,300
Still, she was desperate to find
that special someone.

363
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,000
And that's exactly who she found.

364
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
Wash your hands. Okay.

365
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,200
All righty. Here's one for you and one for Amy.

366
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,800
All right, have fun, and I'll be right
here if you need me, okay?

367
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,100
From the moment she saw her...

368
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,500
is this seat taken?

369
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,600
No. Go ahead.

370
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,300
Lynette knew she had to have her.

371
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
You know, I couldn't help but notice how
wonderful you are with those children.

372
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,600
Thanks.

373
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm Lynette.

374
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,100
Claire.

375
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,300
Claire?

376
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,400
Always loved that name.

377
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,600
So, Claire

378
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,000
do you come here often?

379
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,400
What's this?

380
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Your son's urine.

381
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I'm going to need a moment.

382
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,500
I think Andrew has been smoking marijuana,

383
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,200
so I want you to take this and
get it tested right away.

384
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,400
Why?

385
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,100
Because I want you to pull him from the swim team,

386
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,800
and I don't think you'll allow it without proof.

387
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,900
Proof or no proof, you're not going
to take him off the team.

388
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,300
Yes, I am.

389
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,900
If you try, I'm going to go to the coach
and tell him to ignore you.

390
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,900
We're not going to screw up Andrew's future
just because he sparked a doobie.

391
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,000
I mean, come on, we've all done it.

392
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
Not all of us.

393
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,300
Rex, I thought you moved back home
to try and straighten Andrew out,

394
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
to teach him the consequences of his actions.

395
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,600
I don't understand why you're fighting me on this.

396
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,200
Because I disagree, because
we're still getting divorced,

397
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,500
and I don't have to let you push me around anymore.

398
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,000
I never pushed you around.

399
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,400
We always made our decisions together.

400
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,300
No, you always make decisions,
then tell me I agree.

401
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,600
18 years of smiling and taking it -- what a liar I was.

402
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,900
Thank god you're out of my life.

403
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,200
Rex.

404
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,300
What the hell are you doing?

405
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,700
Same thing you just did to every memory
I have of our marriage.

406
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,200
You know what?

407
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,500
If you were my mom, I'd smoke pot, too!

408
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,500
So your boss made you return her underwear?

409
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,100
Yep, after she had already worn them once.

410
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,600
Couldn't you have just said no?

411
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,900
You don't say no to Alexis if
you want to keep your job.

412
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,100
She sounds awful.

413
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,500
What can I do? I love the kids.

414
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,300
Boy, if we had a nanny like you at my house,
we would treat her like gold.

415
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,200
Did I mention I have four very lovable kids?

416
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,300
Really?

417
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,200
Oh, yes.

418
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Oh, no.

419
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,000
What?

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,200
It's Alexis.

421
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,300
I don't want her to get the wrong
idea, so you should go.

422
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,000
Are you going to be here tomorrow?
I want to see you again.

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,300
No. I'm busy.

424
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,600
I just want to talk.

425
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,200
Lynette, this isn't right.

426
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,400
Claire, Claire, please.

427
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,700
All right.

428
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,600
I will be at this address until noon tomorrow.

429
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,200
Now go.

430
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,700
Okay.

431
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,400
Hi. Where are the kids?

432
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,300
What are you doing here?

433
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,200
I know you know,

434
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,900
and you're probably freaking out,
so I just wanted to explain.

435
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,600
What me and Mrs. Solis have --

436
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,600
it's deep,

437
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,700
you know? We've got a future.
It's not just sex.

438
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,400
Listen to me.

439
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
There is no future for you and Gabrielle.

440
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
She's not going to divorce Carlos
and run away with you.

441
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,700
Why not?

442
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,200
Because he has money --a lot of it.

443
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,100
Look, I'm not going to be mowing lawns forever.

444
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
- I have big plans for my life.
- Wow, okay.

445
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,800
You know, just stop talking.

446
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,900
John, how old are you?

447
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,600
Almost 18.

448
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Exactly.

449
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,800
You are not mature enough to have a realistic
perspective on this relationship.

450
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,600
You would be so much happier
with a girl your own age.

451
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,500
She's the one I want.

452
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,400
You know, I really love her.

453
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,900
Please let's welcome Mrs. Arlene Nord!

454
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:01,000
We have Arlene and her husband Norris to thank
for all our folding chairs this evening,

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,800
so please remember for all your folding
chair needs, rent Nord's.

456
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,300
Next up we have Mrs. Betty Nolan.

457
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,200
Betty is looking...

458
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
Thank god Tom could fill in at the last minute.

459
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,900
Why did Carlos have to back out?

460
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,800
Some work emergency. He wouldn't talk about it.

461
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,500
Sometimes I could just kill him.

462
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,000
Well, look on the bright side --
Tom's having the time of his life.

463
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,700
Hands off, fellas. She's all mine.

464
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,300
I guess he does sort of have a dorky charm.

465
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,300
Okay, Bree, you're up first,

466
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,300
followed by Lynette.

467
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,000
Okay.

468
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,500
Uh, and then Edie.

469
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,400
Edie. Where's Edie Britt?!

470
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Over here!

471
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,400
Edie, what did you do to that dress?

472
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
Well, I made it audience-friendly.

473
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,900
Can you tell I'm not wearing any underwear?

474
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
Yes.

475
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,900
Good.

476
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,300
Sorry I'm late.

477
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,500
You should never take this dress
off for your entire life.

478
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,200
Really? I look okay?

479
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,800
Oh, Susan, you look so gorgeous.

480
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,500
Doesn't she, Edie?

481
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,600
Uh, it's a bit much.

482
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Gabrielle, you have to change the lineup.

483
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,100
Susan has to go last. Nothing is going to top this.

484
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,800
Oh, no, isn't Helen Rowland going last?

485
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,700
Well, she never showed up.
Somebody's got to take her place.

486
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,000
Yeah, I think that's a great idea.

487
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
Okay, let's go.

488
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,800
You really do look fantastic.

489
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,100
Next up we have Mrs. Bree Van De Kamp

490
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,600
in a pink party dress with laser cut
full skirt and silk belt.

491
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,600
And here's another exquisite ball gown by Halston,

492
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,100
modeled by the devastatingly sexy Lynette Scavo.

493
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,900
Notice the fine detail,

494
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,600
the clean lines...

495
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,300
the dress is nice, too.

496
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,800
Next up, please welcome Edie...

497
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,000
Britt.

498
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,800
Edie britt.

499
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,800
Please tell Gabrielle I'm sorry
I backed out of the show.

500
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,800
I'm just not in a very festive mood right now.

501
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,700
Helen.

502
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,200
Helen, you're here.

503
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,700
Did they tell you about the change in the lineup?

504
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,900
I'm going to go last. I hope that's okay.

505
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,500
There's a special place in hell
for people like you.

506
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,100
I'm sorry. It wasn't my decision.

507
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,400
You're an adult.

508
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Take some responsibility.

509
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,500
What is wrong with you?

510
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,200
Edie is wearing a dignified classic,

511
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,500
perfect for a Sunday tea or christening.

512
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,500
For god's sake, Helen, this is for charity!

513
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,300
Edie Britt, everyone.

514
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,300
Keep your hands off my son.

515
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,300
What?!

516
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,200
And, uh, finally, to cap off our evening...

517
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,100
Come on. You're on.

518
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,600
Please welcome the radiant

519
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,000
Susan Mayer!

520
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,100
Tom, say something.

521
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,900
A vision in white silk,

522
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
chiffon with gold,

523
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,600
hand-beaded french lace,

524
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,800
and lavender marabou.

525
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,200
Susan Mayer.

526
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh, she's never looked better..

527
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,700
Susan, I feel awful about what happened.

528
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,100
Susan, talk to me.

529
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
Okay, you want me to talk?

530
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,500
You're going to find Helen Rowland,
and you're going to tell her the truth

531
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,900
before everyone in this neighborhood thinks that
I'm the one sleeping with an underage boy.

532
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,300
I can't do that.

533
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,200
Why not?

534
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,100
Because she'll tell Carlos, and he'll divorce me.

535
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,200
So what? You obviously don't love him.

536
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,800
I do love him. I-I do.

537
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
It's just... complicated.

538
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,400
You know? There's --

539
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,000
there's got to be another way to fix this.

540
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
God. You are so weak.

541
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,200
Susan, don't be like this.

542
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,200
What did you expect, a hug?

543
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,100
Hey.

544
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,500
Shh.

545
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,000
I took --

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,500
Alexis is still here.

547
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,600
Oh.

548
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,900
She was supposed to go to pilates,
but she got her period.

549
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,800
You got to go.

550
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,600
Just give me a second.

551
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,700
No. She saw you at the park, okay?

552
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,700
She knows what you're trying to do.
You're not the first person to approach me.

553
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
Claire!

554
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,900
How can you stay here after the way she treats you?

555
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,700
She can be tough,

556
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,300
but it comes with the territory, right?

557
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,600
I would never treat you that way.

558
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,300
Claire, what did you do with the aspirin?!

559
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:11,900
I will give you a 20% bump on what
she's paying you, plus overtime.

560
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,700
Damn it, Claire, where the hell are you?!

561
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,600
I don't take orders from your friends,

562
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm not a telephone answering service,
and I don't do laundry.

563
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,600
Dishes?

564
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,400
Only the kids'.

565
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,600
How fast can you pack?

566
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,300
I got a nanny

567
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
Where are you going to go?

568
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't know,

569
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
but I can't go home.

570
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,500
Are you afraid of your dad?

571
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,300
No, it's not him, all right?

572
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,200
It's -- it's me. My life is really messed up.

573
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,400
It's bad.

574
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,800
What's bad? You can tell me.

575
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,600
No, I can't.

576
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,800
It's better that you don't know.

577
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,700
I already know a little.

578
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,400
Hi, Danielle. How was school?

579
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,300
It was okay.

580
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,600
Good. Where does Andrew keep his marijuana?

581
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:04,400
Bree had resorted to extreme measures
to save her son's soul.

582
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,200
As she rummaged through Andrew's private possessions,

583
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,800
it occurred to her that sometimes a little betrayal

584
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,400
is good for the soul.

585
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,900
I was really young, like 4.

586
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,700
I heard my mom and my dad yelling.

587
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,000
I heard them yell my name...

588
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,600
and hers.

589
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,300
Dana?

590
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,000
Mm-hmm.

591
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,300
So...

592
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,100
I went down to the room, and I
saw them cleaning it up.

593
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,600
Cleaning what up?

594
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,300
Blood.

595
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,300
Was it Dana's?

596
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
I think so.

597
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,500
I couldn't remember this for
the longest time, and then...

598
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
my mom killed herself,

599
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,300
and I started having these dreams.

600
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,800
I-I don't even see Dana.

601
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
I just -- I- I see --I see the blood

602
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,400
and my mom picking me up

603
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,700
and putting --putting me on my bed
and whispering that it's not my fault.

604
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,500
But after that, every time I'd
say her name, they'd get upset.

605
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,600
I wasn't even allowed to say it anymore.

606
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,100
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying.

607
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I killed my baby sister.

608
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,700
Zach, oh, my god.

609
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,700
And they buried her

610
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,600
to protect me.

611
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
Helen. Do you have a minute?

612
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,600
Oh, Gabrielle,

613
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:31,400
I didn't get a chance to tell you how sorry I was
about what happened at the fundraiser.

614
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,100
I didn't intend to cause a scene.

615
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,600
No, it's okay. People didn't even notice.

616
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,000
Well, this is a little awkward.

617
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,900
I-I know you're friends with Susan Mayer,

618
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,800
but let's just say I had my reasons.

619
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,700
It wasn't Susan.

620
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,100
It was me.

621
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,900
What?

622
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,300
I'm the one who was sleeping with your son.

623
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,800
I'm so sorry.

624
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,600
For how long?

625
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,100
Almost a year.

626
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,200
But it's over now.

627
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,000
So when it started, he was...16?

628
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,500
I think.

629
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,300
But, Helen, y-you have to
believe me -- it's over now.

630
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,000
No, you're wrong.

631
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,800
It's not even close to being over.

632
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,900
Hey, coach wants to see you.

633
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,100
Really?

634
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,700
Hey, I bet it's about my scholarship.

635
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,600
Hello?

636
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,900
Yes, this is she.

637
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,400
Marijuana in his locker?
Oh, I'm just horrified.

638
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,200
There must be some sort of terrible mistake.

639
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,400
Um, yeah, okay.
Well, I will be right down.

640
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,900
Elsewhere, another, darker secret
was the object of an investigation.

641
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,100
Mr. Linder.

642
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,100
Mr. Linder!

643
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,100
Huh?

644
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,200
Detective Beckerman. This is detective Burnett.

645
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,400
We were hoping for a minute of your time.

646
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,200
If you know anything about Zach's
whereabouts, you need to tell me now.

647
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:45,900
Um...

648
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,800
honey, what's going on?

649
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,100
Zach's gone from Silvercrest.

650
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,600
They found letters in his room --

651
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
letters from julie.

652
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,700
Well, yes, they were writing to each other.

653
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,800
I need to see those letters.

654
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,800
Mom, they're private.

655
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,700
My son is missing.

656
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,000
Julie, in the letters, did Zach
say anything about running away?

657
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,500
No.

658
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
There's your answer.

659
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,900
Susan --

660
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,900
if we hear anything, I will let you know right away.

661
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,800
I understand how worried you must be.

662
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,100
Obviously, you don't.

663
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,200
Paul, my daughter doesn't lie.

664
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,200
This was a very popular design.

665
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,500
I must have sold several hundred of these
just like it about 10 years back.

666
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,400
Do you keep any kind of documentation?

667
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,500
Yeah, I have a list of customers' names
on file... somewhere.

668
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,400
It's been a while.

669
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,800
We'll need a copy of that list.

670
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
Oh, sure.

671
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,200
Wow, this chest looks like it's been through hell.

672
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, we pulled it out of Rockwater Lake.

673
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,800
You could say by way of hell, considering.

674
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,100
W-was there anything in the chest?

675
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,300
It had a body inside --

676
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,200
adult female.

677
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,800
Yeah, but -- how do you fit a body
into a chest that size?

678
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,400
It was chopped up.

679
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,500
Of all the stupid, boneheaded decisions.

680
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,300
What were you thinking?

681
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
I was set up, all right?

682
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,400
The coach got an anonymous phone call.

683
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:52,000
Andrew, what does it matter? The pot was there.

684
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,500
I was holding it for a friend.

685
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,100
You know...

686
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,100
I can't decide which is more humiliating --

687
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,200
the fact that my son got caught with pot in his locker

688
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,900
or that he can't even come up with
a decent enough lie to explain it.

689
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,200
Gabrielle believed there was an excellent chance

690
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:35,300
Helen Rowland would inform Carlos of
his wife's extramarital activities.

691
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Gabrielle knew she had to come clean.

692
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,900
Carlos?

693
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,800
Yeah?

694
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,200
But coming clean...

695
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,500
I, uh...

696
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,300
was not one of Gabrielle's specialties.

697
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,900
I'm going to bed.

698
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,800
Thanks for the news flash.

699
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,100
She turned me in.

700
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,300
Carlos!

701
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,500
Carlos, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

702
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,100
Sorry for what?

703
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Just know that whatever happens,
I love you very, very much.

704
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,800
FBI. Open the door.

705
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,300
Oh, my god.

706
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,600
FBI. If you do not open the door,

707
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,800
I am authorized to enter the
premises by use of force.

708
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,300
Carlos Solis, I have a warrant for your arrest.

709
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,200
You have the right to remain silent.

710
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,800
Huh?

711
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,700
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

712
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,500
Call our lawyer.

713
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,600
You have the right to speak with an attorney...

714
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,300
- And have an attorney present during questioning.
- Carlos. what's happening?

715
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:57,000
If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be
appointed for you at government expense.

716
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,500
Carlos, wait!

717
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,200
Gabrielle, this will all be taken care of, I promise.

718
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,000
I-I'm innocent, I swear to god.

719
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
It was Tanaka. He set me up.

720
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,300
People are complicated creatures.

721
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,800
On the one hand, able to perform
great acts of charity.

722
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,200
On the other...

723
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,600
capable of the most underhanded
forms of betrayal.

724
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,700
It's a constant battle that rages within all of us

725
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,000
between the better angels of our nature

726
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,800
and the temptation of our inner demons.

727
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,000
And sometimes, the only way
to ward off the darkness...

728
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,800
is to shine the light of compassion.

729
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,400
They took him away in handcuffs.
