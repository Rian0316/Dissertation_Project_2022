00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,530
你根本闻不到味道

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,470
不然我就得像别人那样

来吧 我们走 我每隔几个月都会进去
Come on, let's go. I stop in every few months

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,140
让监控拍我几张照片
to get caught on the security cameras,

110
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,510
好让别人以为我还在那个圈子里
so people will think I'm still in the mix.

111
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,830
你想被监控拍到自己?
Trying to get caught on security cameras?

112
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,950
哇 我们真是太不同了
Whoa, we are different.

113
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,330
我们进去吧 在里面的时候

114
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,950
要不咱们去搞个商业贷款吧

115

我们才不要去商业贷款!
We are not getting a business loan!

116
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,630
你要想骗我进城
You tricked me into coming to the city.

117
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,420
至少也得把我敲晕 然后像人一样塞进后车箱吧
At least knock me out and put me in the trunk like a person.

118
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,020
好 我听你的 不贷款
Okay, I hear you. No loan.

119
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,130
但是我们能否至少进去走一下
But can we at least go in there

120
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,850
让我闻一下金库的味道
so I can get a hit off some vault fumes

121
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,330
再来杯免费的圣诞可可?
and a complimentary Christmas cocoa?

122

这外面太冷了
It's so cold out here

124
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,080
我的胸罩都要起诉我的胸骚扰它了
my bra is suing my nipples for assault.

125
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,160
不如咱们贷个15000美元吧
I'd say we ask for $15,000.

126
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,120
这里近得我几乎闻到一百块的味道了
So close I almost smelled a 100.

127
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,390
你是怎么了?
What is with you?

128
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,020
要是我想让你一直骗我
If I wanted you to keep lying to me,

129
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,080
我就会跟你约会了
I'd date you.

130

Max 我们需要更多资金
Max, we need more capital

131
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,990
这样就能大量购买我们的T恤
so we can buy our shirts in bulk,

132
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,780
然后 如果我们再努力点工作
and then, if we work even harder,

133
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,230
我们就能获得双倍利润
we can double our profit.

134
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,950
我们甚至连信用检查都通过不了的
Okay, we won't pass even the credit check.

135
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,640
根据我的社保号

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,050

149
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,620
Max 别这样
Max, come on.

150
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,530
银行就在那儿 我们的T恤就在这里
The bank's there. Our shirt's in here.

151
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,990
我们只要进去 给他们看 然后申请贷款
Let's just go in, show them, and apply for that loan.

152
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,640
- 求你了!  - 不
- Please!  - No.

153
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,530
- 求你了!  - 不
- Please!  - No.

154
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,200
- 求你了!  - 不
- Please!  - No.

155
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,580
就在那儿有个小东西
And that right there was a little something

156
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,570
写着"我们要银行贷款"
called "us asking for a bank loan."

157
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,850
现在走吧
Now let's go.

158
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,070
我不会走的 除非你告诉我
I'm not leaving here until you tell me

159
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,130
你究竟在担心什么
what the underlying issue is.

160
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,400
我再也不爱你了
I'm not in love with you anymore.

161
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,700
Max 认真点
Max, be serious.

162
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,540
这整件T裇都是你的创意
This whole T-shirt was your idea.

163
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,780
真正的问题是什么?
What's the real problem?

164
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,710
这就是问题所在
That's the problem.

165
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,240
这些T恤是我的主意
Those shirts were my idea

166
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,600
我想出来的东西从不值一万五
and nothing that comes from me is worth $15,000.

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,860
除了我在如意宝贝店卖出的那个婴儿
Aside from that baby I sold on E-baby.

168
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,890
Max 我知道这些T恤是赚钱的玩意儿
Max, I know these T-shirts are a money-maker.

169
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,740
哦 我有赚钱的玩意儿 但不是它
Oh, I have a money-maker and that's not it.

170
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,700
我可以证明
I can prove it.

171
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,930
看 这是Rodney
Look, this is Rodney,

172
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,970
我童年的高档服装店
my childhood over-priced clothing store.

173
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,020
早知道我们今天是去游览童年
If I had known we were going on the childhood tour today,

174
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,550
我就会穿一双更舒服的鞋子
I would have worn more comfortable shoes

175
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,330
并且呆在家里
and stayed home.

176
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,580
看见模特身上那件T恤吗?
See the shirt on the mannequin?

177
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,730
至少两百美元
At least $200.

178
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,530
我们的T恤没理由卖不到相同的价钱
And there's no reason we can't sell ours for just as much.

179
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,270
我会证明给你看 跟着我
I'll show you. Follow me.

180
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,680
好 我会关注你的 但不是在照片网上
Oh, okay, I will. But not on Instagram,

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,200
因为你已经是晒照狂人
'cause you're out of control.

182
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,850
这地方真花哨
This place is fancy

183
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,370
连纽瓦克的新港务局都会自叹不如
and I've been to the new Port Authority in Newark.

184
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,750
相信我 好吗?
Just trust me, okay?

185
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,460
你要穿着Wang(品牌)的高跟鞋跳两下
You need to jump on those Wang pumps

186
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,820
或者像本·阿弗莱克演的那样 成为"消失的爱人"
or like Ben Affleck, they will be "Gone, girl."

187
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,820
{\an8}本·阿弗莱克出演了电影"消失的爱人"

188
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,360
让我来说 我会说他的语言
Let me do the talking. I speak his language.

189
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,510
那是什么语言? 葡萄基佬语?
And what language is that? Portu-gays?

190
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,790
你好 女士们 欢迎光临Rodney
Hello, ladies. Welcome to Rodney.

191
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,120
我是Barry
I'm Barry.

192
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,290
你们是在假日购物吗?
Doing a little holiday shopping?

193
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,060
我们不能说圣诞节
We're not allowed to say Christmas.

194
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,100
实际上 我们是在假日出售
As a matter of fact, we're doing a little holiday selling.

195
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,360
哦 你在"出售"
Oh, you're "selling."

196
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,440
懂了 摇头丸? 可卡因?
Got it. Molly? Coke?

197
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,470
我都不感兴趣
Not that I'm interested.

198
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,350
自从火岛2010年的缉毒行动后我就戒了
I've been clean since Fire Island 2010.

199
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,300
还有2012年那时
And 2012.

200
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,220
不嗑嗨却要做自己 这很难受吧
It must be hard to not be high and be you.

201
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,640
因为不能嗑嗨了却要靠近你
Because it's hard for me

202
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,410
这让我觉得很难受
to just be near you and not be high.

203
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,960
你懂的 妹子
Yeah, you get it, girl.

204
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
实际上我们是想看看你是否有兴趣
Actually, we wanted to see if you'd be interested

205
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,430
卖我们这种图案超棒的T恤
in selling one of our fabulous graphic t-shirts.

206
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,980
哦 不不不不不...
Oh, n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n...

207
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,370
各种"不" 好吗?
all sorts of "no", okay?

208
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,390
虽然爱土耳其毡帽 配腰带的长袍 以及男孩子
As much as I love a fez, a caftan, and a teenage boy,

209
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,330
但这里不是摩洛哥
this isn't Morocco.

210
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,850
真是一长串烦人的"不"
That's a really long and boring version of "No."

211
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,370
就像你说"不! 独角戏(品牌)时装秀"
It's like you just did  "No! The One Woman Show."

212
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,490
这是我们的T恤...
Here's our T-shirt...

213
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,310
看看
Look.

214
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,840
知道我是怎么对年轻的马克·雅可布说的吗
I'll tell you two what I said to a young Marc Jacobs.

215
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,570
别送给我 我不要垃圾货
Stop offering, I'm off the junk.

216
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,130
节日快乐
Merry Holiday.

217
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,140
我要让圣母知道啥叫节日
I'll show Mary a holiday.

218
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,880
咱们的裇衫和这些一样好
Our shirts are just as good as these.

219
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,820
他只要看了就知道
He just needs to see it.

220
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,500
给你 拿着
Here, hold this.

221
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,110
你是谁? 美国精神病人?
What are you? American Psycho?

222
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,550
一旦有人对你说"不"
As soon as someone says "No" to you,

223
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,320
你就开始肢解女人
you start dismembering women.

224
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,350
我脱不下她的T恤
I can't get her shirt off.

225
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,610
告诉她 她可以过夜
Tell her she can spend the night

226
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,150
而你早上会给她买华夫饼
and you'll buy her a waffle in the morning.

227
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,200
好了 把咱们的T恤给我
Okay, hand me our shirt.

228
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,520
我觉得这将是我们关键的一步
I think this is gonna be big for us.

229
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,800
你还觉得Michael Buble(爵士歌手)唱摇滚呢
You also think Michael Buble rocks.

230
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,160
哦 我要抓紧了 Barry快出来了
Oh, I have to hurry. Barry is coming.

231
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,370
Barry快出来了
Barry is coming.

232
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,460
看来你是爱和陌生人爱爱啊
I'm guessing mostly with strangers.

233
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,250
真的假的?
Seriously?

234
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,860
真的假的?
Seriously?

235
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,800
不!是!吧?
Ser-I-ous-ly?

236
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,520
好可爱
So cute.

237
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,410
看看后面 写着"奶油爆满"
And look on the back, "Cream Filled."

238
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:50,760
有趣
Funny.

239
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,720
人们会觉得我很有个性
People will think I have a personality.

240
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,770
Barry 把这件和我要其他那些都放一起
Barry, put this with my other stuff.

241
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,750
多少钱?
How much?

242
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,990
三百块
300.

243
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,560
还说什么戒掉了 那家伙嗨了吧
Forget the sober story. That guy is high.

244
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,850
给我来十件
I'll take ten.

245
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,440
对于我那些不讨厌自己胳膊的朋友来说
They'll make great Hanukkah gifts

246
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,990
这会是很棒的光明节礼物
for my friends who don't hate their arms.

247
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,090
我们的T恤刚被一个有钱的死女人买了
All our shirts just got bought by a rich dead lady.

248
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,360
周五前再给我来三十件
I'll need 30 more by Friday.

249
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,600
是的 我还在等
Yes, I'm still holding.

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,970
我要下一个紧急的T恤订单
I need to place a rush t-shirt order.

251
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,660
不行 不行 不能让我再等了
No, no, no, no, no. Don't put me on hold again.

252
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,780
我已经听了七遍
I've been through seven rounds of

253
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,120
"奶奶被驯鹿撞倒了"这歌
Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer.

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,460
她又被撞了一遍
And she just got run over again.

255
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,490
咱们现在从疯基佬那里赚了点钱
Now that we have all this crazy gay t-shirt money,

256
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,120
我想我们应该再买贵点的礼物
I think we should up the prices on these gifts.

257
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,850
所以咱们一致决定给Earl送一辆车
So we agree, we're getting Earl a car.

258
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,750
送Sophie一幢她梦寐以求的湖边乡间别墅
Sophie is getting the country house with the lake she's always wanted.

259
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,400
Max Rodney把咱的T恤卖三百一件
Max, Rodney is selling our shirts for 300,

260
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,570
但咱们只能赚25块
but we only get 25 of that.

261
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,310
750块钱可买不了一幢房子
And you can't buy a house for $750.

262
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,490
因为咱们不在底特律
It's not Detroit.

263
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,850
是的 嗨 终于来了个人接电话
Yes, hi, hi, hi. Finally a person.

264
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,510
周五前我要五十件T恤
I need 50 T-shirts by Friday.

265
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,140
但是你们名片写着 你们确保翌日邮递
But your business card says you guarantee next-day delivery.

266
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,940
哦 你不能"确保"那个保证?
Oh, you can't "Guarantee" that guarantee?

267
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,400
好了 说到Oleg
Okay, now Oleg.

268
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,450
这个一无所有 但是让你
What do you get a man who has nothing,

269
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,010
一览无遗的男人 你还能送他什么
but shows you everything?

270
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,700
什么叫"还有什么需要帮忙的吗?"
What do you mean "Is there anything else you can help me with?"

271
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,500
你究竟有帮到我什么
When did you help me at all?

272
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,500
我现在开始想 如果奶奶真的为你们工作
And I'm beginning to think if Grandma works for you,

273
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,040
她不是被驯鹿撞死的
she didn't get run over by that reindeer,

274
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,720
她是自己一头撞死在雪橇车的
she threw herself under a sleigh.

275
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,780
送给Sophie一瓶斯纳普饮料
So, Sophie's getting a Snapple.

276
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,890
跟去年一样
Like last year.

277
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,930
Max 我们不能放弃 我们可以自己完成
Max, we can't give up. We can do them ourselves.

278
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,670
我们只需要找人完成
We just need someone else to do them.

279
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,140
来吧 快出去
Come on, let's go.

280
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,620
外面有顾客等好久了
There are customers who have been here

281
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,700
罗宾·西克也等了好久才红
since Robin Thicke was relevant.

282
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,110
等等 Han 你丝印了那些漂亮的卡片
Wait a minute, Han. You silk-screened all those beautiful cards.

283
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,830
你在艺术方面有才能
You have an artistic side.

284
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,940
是的 只是后面没曲线
Yeah, but no backside.

285
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,020
而且他的正面影响市容
And a front side that shouldn't be allowed outside.

286
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,370
你为什么这么慢啊?
Why is this taking so long?

287
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,090
连那些圣诞卡你你丝印了
You did all those Christmas cards.

288
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,310
难道不是个子越小的动作就越快吗?
Aren't small creatures supposed to be fast?

289
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,780
说实话 那些卡片是去年就应该做好的
Truth be told, those were supposed to be ready last year.

290
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,010
但是 着什么急呢?
But, what was the rush?

291
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,410
反正你俩也没事干
You two weren't going anywhere.

292
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,920
Han 你只要说"是"或"不是"就行
Han, just a simple "Yes" or "No".

293
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,060
我们不做评论
No judgment.

294
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,080
你有没有跟这台机器做爱?
Have you had sex with this machine?

295
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,250
比你们俩给我打工更糟糕的事
The only thing worse than you two working for me

296
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,590
就是我给你们打工
is me working for you.

297
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,310
连口水都不给我喝
You haven't even given me water.

298
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,630
水是给工人喝的
Water is for closers.

299
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:44,270
我说的"工人"是指真正制作衣服的人
By "closers," I mean people who actually make clothes.

300
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
谁啊?
Who's that?

301
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,050
Han 你是不是向儿童保护机构举报我们了?
Han, did you call Child Protective Service on us?

302
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,810
那些淤青可能是任何人造成的
'Cause those bruises could be from anyone.

303
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,340
Han 两个小时你才弄好一件
Han, you've only made one shirt in two hours.

304
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,240
这可是杰作 你想要一个公民凯恩那样的经典
And it's a masterpiece. Do you want one Citizen Kane

305
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,580
还是三十个好景在望那样的烂片?
or 30 Here Comes the Booms?

306
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,480
同志们 我需要你们的帮助
Guys, I need your help.

307
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,240
Sophie就在我后面 需要让她高兴起来
Sophie's right behind me and needs some cheering up.

308
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,750
自从她昨晚在嘿咻的中途中醒来
I haven't seen her this depressed

309
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,340
我从未见过她这么沮丧的
since she woke up mid-coitus last night.

310
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,050
嗨
Hi.

311
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,340
嗨 嗨 丫头们
Hi. Hi, girls.

312
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,800
圣诞节快乐
Merry Christmas.

313
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,310
问个问题
Quick question:

314
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,050
如果我打开灶 关上窗户
if I were to turn on that oven and close all the windows,

315
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,350
我会死吗?
would I die?

316
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,120
不会
Nope.

317
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,710
否则我也会不站在
Otherwise I wouldn't be standing here

318
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,370
效率低下的金正"一"旁边
next to Kim Jong-Only-Done-One.

319
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:36,080
Sophie 怎么回事?
Sophie, what's the problem?

320
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,810
告诉Han 让他赶紧干活
Tell Han while he gets back to work.

321
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,160
Han 你快点
And Han, pick up the pace

322
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,600
否则我又要掐你了
or I'm going to start the pinching again.

323
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,840
我要输掉圣诞节装饰比赛了
I'm gonna lose the Christmas decorating contest.

324
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,700
我没有活下去的念头了
Oh, I have nothing to live for.

325
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:55,110
Caroline 也许你每天都是这种感觉
Oh, Caroline, this is probably how you feel every day.

326
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
Sophie的对手在她门前
Sophie's competition made a live-action

327
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,030
搞了场北极实时表演
North Pole workshop in front of her house.

328
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:04,660
我楼上只有灯火通明的耶稣出生地
Well, all I got upstairs is a light-up nativity

329
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,760
和价值两万五的圣诞节装饰品
and $25,000 worth of Target Christmas decorations.

330
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,130
她昨晚烧坏了五根保险丝
She blew five fuses last night.

331
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,890
我从未想过我会嫉妒保险丝
I never thought I'd be jealous of a fuse.

332
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,630
Sophie 我们真的没时间弄这个
Sophie, we really can't get into this now.

333
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,330
我们还得把T恤赶工制好
We are way behind with these T-shirts.

334
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,930
这些T恤可是我们千载难逢的好机会
And these T-shirts are a once in a lifetime chance

335
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,230
能为我们的生意打开一片新天地
for us to go to a new place with our business.

336
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,150
嗯 我听到你说的了 丫头们
Oh yeah, I hear you, girls.

337
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,070
我到底在这里干嘛啊
I mean, what am I doing here

338
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,040
担心什么破比赛?
sitting worrying about some silly contest?

339
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,680
这可是圣诞节
It's Christmas.

340
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,060
来吧 同志们
Come on everybody.

341
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,380
我们都应该帮帮丫头们
We should all be helping the girls.

342
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,930
真的? 那真是太棒了
Really? That would be so amazing.

343
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,950
当然! 你们都不用给我工钱
Sure! And you wouldn't even have to pay me back

344
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,630
只要明天晚上把你们的谷仓和马借我用用
by letting me use your barn and your horse tomorrow night

345
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:49,230
我们要上演耶稣诞生 你们都要参加
for a live nativity scene, which you would all have to be in.

346
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,040
差不多就是这样
Or something like that.

347
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,220
我想咱们刚遭遇了季节性的敲诈
I think we just had a seasonal shake-down.

348
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,570
Han在弄最后一个 我们会完成的
Han's doing the last one. We're gonna make it.

349
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,380
真不敢相信 你贴着那假胡子还能这么开心
I can't believe you're in such a good mood with that beard.

350
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,260
上周你发现自己下巴长了两根毛时
Last week when you found those two chin hairs,

351
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,000
可没这么开心
you weren't so chipper.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,690
我只是很开心有新衣服穿了
I'm just so happy I have new clothes.

353
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,270
好了 最后一件衬衫
Okay, final shirt.

354
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,190
然后你们俩就可以消失了
Then I get you two out of my angel hair.

355
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:20,810
Han 要不是你的话
Han, you know, if it weren't for you,

356
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,640
我们绝对完不成任务
we would have never gotten this done.

357
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,650
你真的是个小天使
You really are a little angel.

358
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,350
没错 但我还是很惊讶
Yeah, you are. But I'm still surprised

359
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,920
你竟然不扮婴儿
you weren't cast as the baby.

360
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,520
哦  我被问到来着 但我拒绝了
Oh, I was asked, but I declined.

361
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,590
我花了十年才摆脱尿布
I spent ten year getting out of diapers.

362
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,320
我才不要重新穿上
I'm not getting back in.

363
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,310
Han 作为你的圣诞礼物
Han, for your Christmas gift,

364
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,730
我就假装没听到吧
I'll pretend I never heard that.

365
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,640
各就各位
Places everybody.

366
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,370
评委们要来了 我好了
The judges are coming. I'm ready.

367
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,240
约瑟好了 "耶"菜娃娃好了
Joseph's ready. Cabbage Patch Christ is ready.

368
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,750
快
Come on!

369
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,240
那乳沟是怎么回事?
What's with the cleavage?

370
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,970
可不是
I know.

371
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:58,360
她像是非圣女玛丽亚
She's like the Not-So-Virgin Mary.

372
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:03,810
小天使 牧羊人 长胡子的小姐
Angel, Shepherd, Lady with the beard,

373
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,740
快点 到马厩来
come on, get in the stable.

374
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,690
马厩?
Stable?

375
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,970
我们的样子看起来更像"没救"才对
The way we look it should be an "Unstable."

376
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,880
都准备好了吗? 我要开谷仓门了
Everybody ready? I'm going to open the barn door.

377
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,120
我看你的门早就有点开了
Yeah, I think your barn door's already a little open.

378
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,250
那个 我是谁来着?
Okay now, who am I again?

379
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,390
战神?
Voltron?

380
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,590
我不说假话 可能有智者
I'm not gonna lie. One of the wise men

381
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,570
吸过"圣大麻"
might have smoked some "Myrrh-ijuana."

382
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,150
这份圣诞礼物很有心 Max
That was a very nice Christmas gift, Max.

383
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,010
谢谢 Earl 对了 Sophie
Thanks, Earl. By the way, Sophie,

384
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,860
谷仓加上我们穿得跟白痴似的?
the barn and us dressed like idiots?

385
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,380
是给你的圣诞礼物
That's your Christmas gift.

386
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,630
还有 一会儿跟Oleg来一炮
Oh, and hey, bang Oleg later.

387
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,440
Oleg 这是你的礼物
Oleg, that's your gift.

388
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,370
你怎么知道?
How did you know?

389
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,490
他们进来之前 让我们抽点时间回顾一年
Before they come in, let's just take a moment to look around

390
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,760
衷心迎接真正的圣诞精神吧
and really let in the true spirit of Christmas.

391
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,170
我不记得有给你写独白
I don't remember writing you a monologue.

392
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,370
给我闭嘴!
Shut up!

393
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,710
站到马旁边去
Get your ass over by the horse.

394
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,090
来吧 Han 放音乐
Come on, Han. Hit the music.

395
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,370
好了 各位
All right, everybody,

396
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,670
庄严起来
look holy.

397
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,370
我已经穿上内裤了
Best I can do is my underwear.

398
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,850
我去!
Oh , crap!

399
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,760
没错 Felka
Oh, that's right, Felka.

400
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,810
我是上帝他妈
I'm the freakin' mother of God.

401
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,850
我们赢了!
We won!

402
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,360
我好开心赢了
I'm so happy we won.

403

我们赢了! 我们赢了!
We won! We Won!

404
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,930

Okay, show's over.

405
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,460
扔掉孩子 我在楼上等你
Dump the kid, I'll be upstairs.

406
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,500
Max 照顾好"耶"菜娃娃
Max, take care of Cabbage Patch Christ.

407
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,780
给你 Han 你有个和你个子相仿的同伴了
Here, Han. You got a buddy your own size.

408
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,980
太感谢你了 Barry
Thank you so much, Barry.

409
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,120
别忘了 新年过后我从戒毒所回来
And remember, I want 50 more shirts

410
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,100
还要五十件衬衫
after the first of the year when I'm back from rehab.

411
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:02,910
因为女士们 我今年打算过一个白粉圣诞节
'Cause ladies, I am planning a very white Christmas.

412
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,530
Max 这真是太棒了!
Max, this is amazing!

413
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,970
你知道刚刚发生了什么吗?
Do you know what just happened in there?

414
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,520
当然 我偷了一副酷毙了的无指手套
Yeah, I stole some dope-ass fingerless gloves.

415
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,000
我们现在跟他们做生意呢
We're in business with them now.

416
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,540
你得还回去
You have to bring those back.

417
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,310
我为你拿的
I got them for you.

418
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,890
那好吧
Okay.

419
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,750
这就像圣诞奇迹啊
This is like a Christmas miracle.

420
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,960
我们的衬衫在
Our shirts are being sold in

421
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,480
曼哈顿最顶级的傲娇精品店出售
the most exclusive bitchy boutique in Manhattan

422
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,100
而且他们还要货 要很多
and they want more, lots more.

423
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,340
嘿 我们去你的童年银行吧
Hey, let's go into your childhood bank.

424
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,200
我得撒泡成人尿
I need to take an adult pee.

425
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,020
好吧 但这不是在家里 所以记住
Okay, but this isn't home, so remember,

426
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,370
完事了把马桶座放下
put the seat down when you're done.

427
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,030
我们在里面的时候 还可以申请贷款
And while we're in there, we can apply for that loan.

428
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,220
不 不 不 不行 
No, no, no, no, no. We can't.

429
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,480
现在我害怕了
Now I'm afraid.

430
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,290
拜托 到底怎么回事?
Come on, what's the real issue here?

431
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,430
我们刚取得了惊人的成功
We just had this amazing success.

432
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,080
看起来事情一顺百顺
And it looks like things are going our way,

433
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,060
如果我们进去了 可能就都毁了
and if we go in there, it could all be ruined.

434
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,220
你知道怎样会更毁人生吗?
You know what would ruin our lives even more?

435
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,700
就是我们不申请贷款 就得长时间跟Han在一起 
If we don't get that loan and have to spend hours

436
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,130
让他在我们"下面"做衬衫
with Han standing under us trying to finish those shirts.

437
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,140
好吧 那真的是"圣诞夜惊魂"了
Well, that's a real "Nightmare Before Christmas."

438
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,020
我们走
Let's go.

439
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,490
很好 因为我已经要尿出来了
Good, cause I'm starting to pee a little.

440
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,860
我们拿到贷款了!
He gave us a loan!

441
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,990
在这条街上工作的人都吸晕了吗?
Is everyone who works on the street high?

442
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,800
简直不敢相信 事情没有搞砸
I can't believe it. It didn't go bad.

443
