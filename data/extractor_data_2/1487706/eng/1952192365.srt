00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,910
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,560
I am going to the Arctic Circle
witheonard,Walowitz, and Koothrappali.

3
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,440
- For three months?
- Yes.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,270
What did you mena when you
said you were going to miss me?

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,840
It means I wish you weren't going.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,330
<i>Three***</i>

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,660
Oh,thank God we're home.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,560
I can't believe we spent three
months in that frozen hell.

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,380
It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,490
I don't know what Arctic expedition you guys
were on, but I thout it was a hoot and a half.

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,060
Oh,hi,Mom.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,750
No,I told you I'd call
you when I got home.*****

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,230
All right,I'm home.

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,280
The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,470
I'm all but certain there'sa Nobel
P Actually,I shouldn't say that.

16
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,650
I'm entirely certain.

17
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,450
No,Mother,I could not feel
your church group *****

18
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,170
e fact th  does not
prove that it worked.

19
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,940
Theat logic is post
hoc ergo propter hoc.

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,740
No,I'm not sassing you in Esko talk.

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,610
I'm gonna go let Penny know we're bac

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,980
Mother,I have to go. Love you. Bye.

23
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,010
Hello,old friend.

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,790
Daddy's home.

25
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,410
Leonard,you're back.

26
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah. I just
stopped by to say--

27
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,090
Yeah. So,hi.

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,860
Damn i I should have gone
over and told her we were back.

29
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,830
Yeah,it was
first-come,first-serve.

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,840
I just want you both tknow, when I publish
my findings,I won't forget your contributions.

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,290
- Great.
- Thanks.

35
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,960
Of course,Ian't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech,

36
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,770
but when I get around
to writing my memoirs,

37
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,770
you can expect a very effusive
footnote and perhaps a signed copy.

38
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,420
- We have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

39
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,450
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

40
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,950
You fellows are planning
a party for me,aren't you?

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,830
Okay,Sheldon,sit down.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,240
If there's going to be a them I should let you know
that I don't care for luau,toga or "under the sea."

43
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,570
Yeah,we'll keep that in mind. Look...

44
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,840
we neeto talk to you about something
that happened at the North Pole.

45
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,660
If this is about the night the heat went
out, there's nothing to be embarrassed about.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,950
It's not about that.

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,480
And we agreed never speak of it again.

48
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:36,090
So we slept together naked.

49
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:41,810
It was only to keep our core
body temperatures from plummeting.

50
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,800
He's spking about it.

51
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,610
For me,it wasa bonding moment.

52
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,390
eldon,you remember the first few weeks
we were looking for magnetic monopoles

53
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
and not finding anything and you were
acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,730
thought we were going
to be gentle with him.

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,330
That's why I added the "tator."

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,230
And then when we finally got our
first positive data, you were so happy.

57
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,950
Oh,yes. In the world of
emoticons, I was colon,capital "D."

58
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,190
Well,in actuali,what your equipment
detected wasn't so much evidence

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,570
of paradigm-shifting
monopoles as it was...

60
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,270
static from the electric can
opener we were turning on and off.

61
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,730
He just went colon, capital "O."

62
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,520
- You tampered with my experiment?
- We h to.

63
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,390
It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,790
You see that? I add the "ensian."

65
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,980
Did Leonard know abouthis?

66
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,650
Leonard's my best friend in the
world. Surely Leonard didn't know.

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,910
Actually,it was his idea.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,930
Of course it was. The
whole planeeks of Leonard.

69
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,950
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you,too

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,110
- I couldn't even think of anyone else ile you were gone.
- Me,neither.

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,420
Except for one night
when the heat went out.

72
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,390
Long story. It's... Don't ask.

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,180
Leonard. Leonard. Leonard.

74
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,830
Do not make a sound.

75
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,910
Whispering, "Do not
make a sound... " ...

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,690
is a sound.

77
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,900
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

78
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,740
Not a good time,Sheldon.

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,480
Penny. nny. Penny.

80
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,320
Oh,this is ridicuus.

81
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,210
What?

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,580
Hello,Penny I realize you're currently at
the mercy of your primitive biological urges,

83
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,160
but as you have an enti lifetime of poor
decisions ahead of you,may I interrupt this one?

84
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,940
*********

85
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,730
Wolowitz has informed me
Comeof your grand deception.

86
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,580
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

87
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,940
Yes,I feel terrible about it.

88
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,730
I will never forgive myself,
I don't expectou to,either,

89
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:19,000
and I would really apprecie it if you
would leave me with Penny fo*******

90
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,060
Okay,can someone plese tellm
me what's going on here?

91
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,530
What's going on is I was d to believe I
was mang groundbreaking strides in science,

92
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,080
when in fact, I was being fed false data

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,990
at the hands of lowitz,Koothrappali
and your furry little boy toy.

94
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,360
Is that true?

95
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,860
It was the onlway to make him happy.

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,090
Well,why'd you have to make him happy?

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,540
Because when he wa't happy,
we wanted to kill him.

98
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,810
There was even a plan.

99
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,840
We were going to throw
his Kindle outside,

100
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,530
and when he went to get it,lock
the do and let him freeze to death.

101
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,620
That seems like a bit
of an overreaction.

102
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,350
No,the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs
to four different sled dog teams and yell,"Mush."

103
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,190
Look,we kept the original data.

104
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,530
You can still blish the actual results.

105
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,790
Yes,but the actual
results are unsuccessful

106
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,300
and I've already sent an e-mail to
everyone at the university explaining that

107
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,980
I have confirmed string theory and forever
changed man's understanding of the universe.

108
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:25,140
Aw,see,yeah,you probably
shouldn't have done that.

109
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,790
So write another e-mail. Set the
record straight. It's no big deal.

110
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,640
You're right,Leonard.
It's not a big deal.

111
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:40,420
All you did was lie to me, destroy my dream
and humiliate me in frt of the whole university.

112
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,850
That,FYI,was sarcasm.

113
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,930
I,in fact,believe it is a big deal.

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,740
Oh,the poor thing.

115
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,200
Yeah,I feel terrible.

116
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,900
Aren't you going to go talk to hit.

117
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,270
What? Uh,he'll be fine. The
guy's a trouper. Come here.

118
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,870
No,you're right-- you
shouldn't talk to him. I will.

119
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,080
Man,I cannot catch a break.

120
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,750
Do y want to talk?

121
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,430
About what? Being
betrayed by my friends?

122
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Spending three months at
the North Pole for nothing?

123
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,040
And I didn't even get
to go to Comic-Con!

124
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,450
Oh,hon...

125
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,550
******

126
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,380
That'for when I'm sick. Sad is not sick.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,800
Sorry. I don't know your sad song.

128
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't have a sad song. I'm not child.

129
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,160
Well,you know,I do understand
what you're going through.

130
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,630
Really? Did you just have the Nobel
Prize in Waitressing stolen from you?

131
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,270
Well,no,but when I was
a senior in high school,

132
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,010
one of my friends heard I was
going to be named head cheerlead.

133
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,770
Oh,I was so excit. My mom
even made me a celebration pie.

134
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,420
Then they named stupid Valerie
Mobacher head cheerleader.

135
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,770
Big ol' slutbag.

136
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:26,400
Are you saying that you think a "celebtion pie"
is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?

137
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,000
Well,they're pretty tasty.

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,380
And on a different,
but not unrelated topic,

139
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,300
based on your current
efforts to buoy my spirits,

140
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,990
do you truly believe that you
were ever fit be a cheer leader?

141
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,680
Look,Sheldon, I juston't think that the guys
and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know?

142
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,810
They just told an unfortunateie
to deal with a difficult situation.

143
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,640
Okay,you ow what it's like?

144
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,420
Remember that scene in the new Star Trek
moe when Kirk has to take over the ship,

145
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,560
so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn't
true, like saying Spock didn't care his mom died?

146
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,130
I missed Comic
- Con and the new Star Trek movie!

147
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,940
- I like the new look.
- Thanks.

148
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,270
I call it "the Clooney."

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,730
I call it "the Mario
and Luigi but whatever.

150
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,230
Hey,how's eldon doing?

151
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,690
Well,he came out of his room
this rning wearing with the Force,

152
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,900
so I'd and trisay,"a ttle better.

153
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,940
"th If I may abruptly change the sject,
did you and Penny finally... you know.

154
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,920
- Howard...
- Personally,I d't care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.

155
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,300
Welltell your genitals what I do
with Penny is none of their business.

156
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,840
He says they didn't do it.

157
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,710
Sheldon,over here.

158
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,730
What are you doing?

159
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,030
I feel bad for the guy.

160
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,910
Shdon,why are you sitting by yourself?

161
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,810
Because I am without friends.

162
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,490
Like the proveial cheese, I stand alone.

163
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,300
Evenhile seated.

164
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,300
Come on. We said we we sorry.

165
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,260
It's going to take
more than an "I'm sorry"

166
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,420
and a store-bought apology pie from
Penny to make up for what y've done to me.

167
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:38,270
Hey,Cooper. Read your retraction email.

168
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,030
Way to destroy your reputation.

169
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,100
You see? People have been pointing
and laughing at me all morning.

170
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,120
That's not true.

171
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,320
People have been pointing and
laughing at you your whole life.

172
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,720
All right,I've had enough.
Attention,everyone. I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

173
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,130
As many of you in the physics department might
know, my career trajectory has taken a minor tour.

174
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,440
Off a cliff.

175
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,540
My credibility mayhave bee

176
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,520
Completely wrecked.

177
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,590
But I would like to remind you that in
science, there's no such thing as failure.

178
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,090
There once was a man who referr to his
prediction of a cosmological constant

179
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,830
as the single "biggest
blunder" of his career.

180
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,370
That man's name was--
surprise,surprise-- Albert Einstein.

181
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,960
Yeah,but research into Dark Energy proved
that Einstein's cosmological constant

182
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:34,690
was actually right all along, so you're
still-- surprise,surprise--a loser.

183
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,410
Oh,you think you're sclever.

184
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,750
Well,let me justell you, while I do
not currently have a scathing retort,

185
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,970
you check your e-mail
periodically for a doozy.

186
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,410
So much for our friendship with Sheldon.

187
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,480
*****

188
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,440
Listen,since we got,you
know,interrupted last night,

189
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,590
I didn't have a chance to give you this.

190
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,490
Oh,Leonard, you shouldn't have.

191
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,710
Oh,boy! What is it?

192
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,560
It's a snowflake. From the North Pole.

193
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:25,730
Are you serious?

194
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,010
It'll last forever. I preserved in a one
percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.

195
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,500
Oh,my God. That's the mo romantic thing anyone's
ever said to me that I didn't understand.

196
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,180
It's actually a pretty simple process.

197
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,540
You see,cyanoacrylates are
monomers which polymerize on--

198
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,280
Red alert,Leonard. Sheldon ran away.

199
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,000
Man,I cannot catch a break.

200
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,150
So,how do you know he ranway?

201
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,310
Well,he's not answering his phone, he
handed in his resignation at the university

202
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,230
and he sent me a text
that said,"I'm nning away."

203
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,660
Okay,well,thanks for letting me know.

204
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,900
Well,Leonard,aren't you
going to do something?

205
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,830
Of course I'm going to do something.

206
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,550
Uh,Howard,you checkthe comic book
Raj, go to the Thai restaurant.

207
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll stay here with
Penny in her apartment.

208
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,330
Oh,damn it.*****

209
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,610
A break cannot be caught.

210
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,210
Hi,Mrs.Cooper.

211
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,340
is?Sheldon went home to Texas

212
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,160
Yeah,no, I know he
resigned. Yes...*******

213
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,840
No,no,no. You-you're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.

214
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,580
Don't worry,I'll ke care of it. Yeah.

215
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,640
All right. New plan.
Howard,you and Raj go to Texas.

216
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,060
I'll stay here with
Penny in her apartment.

217
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,210
Well,you're not gonna go with them?

218
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,240
Well,you know, I gave you the
snowflake and we were kissing and...

219
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,920
Oh,come o I don't want to go to Texas!

220
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,910
Oh,right,and I do? My people already
crossed a desert once. We're done.

221
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,310
Trust me,you'll be fine. See ya.

222
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,010
Well,wait a second, Leonard,come on, how
can you not go? He's your best friend.

223
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,110
- Yeah,but I already saw him naked. Just come here.
- No.

224
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,970
I promise I will be he when you
get back. Just go help Sheldon.

225
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,690
- Really?
- Yeah.

226
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,840
We waited a few months.
We can wt a few more days.

227
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,010
Maybe you can.

228
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,460
Go.

229
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,810
Boy,you cannot catch a break,canou?

230
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,610
Here you go,Shelly.

231
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,690
Thks,Mom.

232
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,980
Hold your horses,young man. Here
in Texas, we pray before we eat.

233
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:58,140
- Aw,Mom.
- This is not California, land of the heathen.

234
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,770
Gimme.

235
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,700
By His hand we are all...

236
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,740
fed.

237
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,090
Give us,Lord, our daily...

238
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,240
bread.

239
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,680
- Please know that we are truly...
- grateful.

240
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,420
- For every cup and every...
- plateful.

241
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:20,210
Amen.

242
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,290
Now,that wasn't so hard, was it?

243
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,320
My objection was based
ononsiderations other than difficulty.

244
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,730
Whatever. Jesus still loves you.

245
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,790
Thank you for carving a smiley
face in my grilled cheese sandwich.

246
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,510
Oh,I know how to take care of my baby.

247
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,580
*****but you can just
pretend he's Chinese.

248
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,020
ttle thin, So,do you want to talk about
what happened with you and yo little friends?

249
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,540
They're not my friends.

250
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,770
All right.

251
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,290
If you recall, when you were little,

252
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,120
we s right here at this very spot anwe
talked about some of the problems you had

253
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,490
gettinalong with the neighbor kids.

254
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,520
That was different.

255
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,200
They were threatened by my telligence and
too stupid to know that's why they hated me.

256
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,260
Oh baby,they knew very
well why they hatedou.

257
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,990
I can't believe you
bought a red cowboy hat.

258
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,270
Hello?I'm wearing a red turtleneck

259
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,260
Plus,it was the only
boys' large they had.

260
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,740
I'm sorry, this does
not look like Texas.

261
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,020
Where's the tumbleweeds?
Whe's the saloons?

262
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,030
Saloons?

263
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah,like in the movies
I saw growing up in India.

264
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,290
You know,uh,Four for
Texas, Yellow Rose of Tex.

265
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,690
This neighborhood is more Texas Chainsaw

266
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,210
I was really hoping
to see a cattle drive.

267
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,810
What can I tell you?

268
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,900
They probably have steaks on sale
at that big-ass Costco over there.

269
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,020
Will you please take **

270
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,510
No,I want to blend in.

271
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,700
To what? Toy Story?

272
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,130
- Hi,boys.
- Howdy,ma'am.

273
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,750
Howdy. You got here qck.

274
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
- We took the red-eye.
- Well,come on in.

275
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,190
Thank you kindly.

276
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,540
Can ... Can I get you
something to drink?

277
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,330
Uh,no,thank you.

278
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,690
If y'all don't mind, I got a
hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.

279
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,760
There's no alcohol in this usehold.
Stop talking like that and lose the hat.

280
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,810
I'll take a diet Y-Hoo if you have it.

281
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,120
You'll take a Coke. What
about you? Radge,isn't it?

282
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,440
Oh,you still having trouble
talking to the ladies?

283
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,460
Because,you know, at o church, we
have a woman who's an amazing healer.

284
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,630
Mostly she does,uh,crutch
and wheelchair people,

285
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,880
but I bet she'd be willing to te a shot at whatever
Third World demon is running around inse of you.

286
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,790
Uh,if you don't mind, Mrs.Cooper,

287
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,660
there's a 3:05 nonstopback to Los Angele and
you have no idea how much I want to be on it.

288
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,570
A girl?

289
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,030
- Uh,yes,ma'am.
- Oh,good. I been praying forou.

290
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:34,740
Oh,Sheldon.

291
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
What are they doing here?

292
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,730
- We came to apologize.
- Agn.

293
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,560
And bring you home. So,why don't you
pack up your stuff and we'll head back

294
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,660
No,thiss my home now.

295
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,960
Thanks to you,my career is over and I will
spend the rest of my life here in Texas

296
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,160
trying to teach evolution to creatnists.

297
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,820
You watch your mouth,Shelly.

298
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,850
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

299
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,600
Evolution isn't an opinion,it's fact.

300
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,270
And that is your opinion.

301
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,730
I forgive you. Let's go home.

302
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,320
*******

303
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,360
How about that I finally caught a break.

304
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,050
You know how ty say when friends
have sex it can get weird?

305
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Sure.

306
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,350
Why does it have to get weird?

307
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,420
I don't know.

308
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,400
I mean,we were friends, and
now we're more than friends.

309
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,510
We're whatever "this" is.

310
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,100
But why label it,right? I
mean, it is what it is and...

311
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:56,780
- Leonard?
- Yeah?

312
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:59,350
- It's weird.
- Totally.
