1
00:00:02,127 --> 00:00:04,503
Let's see, Raj was the kung pao chicken.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:07,548
- I'm the dumplings.
- Yes, you are.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,426
Creepy, Howard.

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,094
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,181
- Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
- That would be me.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,893
Come to Papa, you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,105
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,237
Sit over there.

9
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,744
Sit over there.

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,422
- Baby wipe?
- Why do you have...?

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,466
- No, don't ask.
- No, don't, don't.

12
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,676
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,638
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

14
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:59,933
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

15
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,144
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.

16
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,687
- Why?
- Really, don't.

17
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,442
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

18
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,403
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

19
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,822
...sneeze my hands dry.

20
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,242
Hey, guys.
I just got the most amazing new...

21
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:23,373
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,213
Okay, well, I'll just go eat by myself.

23
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,298
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay.

24
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,676
Between him not talking,
him talking, and him...

25
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,680
...I'm better off alone.

26
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,266
So goodbye, you poor, strange little man.

27
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,857
- She's so considerate.
- So, what's your news?

28
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:51,860
Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

29
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,071
Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ sub-17.

30
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,199
Or as I call it, Planet Bollywood.

31
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,201
Anyway, because of my discovery...

32
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,830
...People magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

33
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,958
- Raj, that's incredible.
- Congratulations.

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:11,463
Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

35
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,299
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,678
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

37
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,848
If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.

38
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,310
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

39
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,564
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

40
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:33,360
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film Juno.

41
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,572
Oh, I'd so do her.

42
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:40,450
You'd do the dolphins.

43
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,202
Do I get a mention...

44
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,247
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

45
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:48,458
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

46
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,794
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

47
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:55,382
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

48
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:59,136
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

49
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,471
It's a lease.

50
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,604
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

51
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,106
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

52
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,985
Peer review? It's People magazine.
People picked me.

53
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,238
- What people?
- The people from People.

54
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,824
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?

55
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,660
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

56
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,246
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

57
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,291
...that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years...

58
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,213
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

59
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,133
Boy, I bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

60
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,681
You proud of yourself?

61
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,018
In general, yes.

62
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,508
Oh, there's my missing neutrino.

63
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,135
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

64
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,138
...weren't you,
you little subatomic dickens?

65
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,892
- Hi, Sheldon.
- Hey, look, I found my missing neutrino.

66
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,687
Oh, good,
we can take it off the milk carton.

67
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,732
We're gonna apologize to Raj
and invite him out to dinner.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,734
Apologize? For what?

69
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:42,114
He came over last night with some pretty
good news and we weren't very supportive.

70
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,701
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

71
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,371
You were a colossal asshat.

72
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,125
Oh, no, I beg to differ.

73
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,752
Of the three of us,
I was by far the most supportive.

74
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,587
Really? Do tell.

75
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,425
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

76
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:06,054
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.

77
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,391
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.

78
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,394
Okay, let's try it this way.

79
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,814
What if this People magazine thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

80
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,527
- I had not considered that.
- Mm-hm. Come on.

81
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,655
I often forget
other people have limitations.

82
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,866
It's so sad.

83
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,952
- He can feel sadness?
- Not really.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,163
It's what you and I call condescension.

85
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,084
Now, when we go in there,
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

86
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,961
But I'm not.

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,423
Well, then fake it. Look at me.

88
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:45,218
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

89
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:49,473
...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

90
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,143
But I'm bigger than that.

91
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,312
Fine. What do you want me to do?

92
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,189
Smile.

93
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:08,450
Oh, crap, that's terrifying.

94
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,496
We're here to see Koothrappali,
not kill Batman.

95
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,792
Try less teeth.

96
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,924
Close enough. Come on.

97
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,053
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey, guys. What's up?

98
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,347
We wanted to invite you
out to dinner tonight.

99
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:34,643
Celebrate your 30 Under 30 thing.
Right, Sheldon?

100
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,899
- It's very nice of you. I would like that.
- Hello, boys.

101
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,734
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Koothrappali.

102
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,444
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Hofstadter.

103
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,946
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Dr. Cooper.

104
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,241
- Dr. Gablehauser.
- Mr. Wolowitz.

105
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:54,246
Boys, I got a question for you.
Who in this room discovered a star?

106
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,290
Actually, 2008-NQ sub-17
is a planetary body.

107
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,668
I'm not talking about you,
I'm talking about me.

108
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:04,506
You, my exotic young friend, are my star.

109
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,509
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

110
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,345
...much like he did with 2008-NQ sub-17.

111
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,306
- Sheldon.
- Ugh. Sorry.

112
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:20,230
Boy, we gotta get you into a better office.
Something more suited to your status.

113
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,650
- You don't have to go to trouble.
- How about von Gerlach's old office?

114
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,903
- I'd rather have Fishbein's. It's bigger.
- Done.

115
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,072
Wait, I called dibs on Fishbein's office...

116
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,659
...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.

117
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,829
He gets a new office, I can't get
paper towels in the men's room?

118
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,707
- Sheldon.
- Damn, this is hard.

119
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,592
Let me ask you, what do you think
the business of this place is?

120
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,141
- Science?
- Money.

121
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,893
Told you.

122
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,896
And this boy's picture
in People magazine...

123
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,607
...is gonna raise us
a pile of money taller than...

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,109
Well, taller than you.

125
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:11,156
- I have a master's degree.
- Who doesn't?

126
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,077
Dr. Koothrappali, have you ever had lunch
in the president's dining room?

127
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:18,747
I didn't even know
there was a president's dining room.

128
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,500
It's the same food as the cafeteria,
only fresh.

129
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,752
- Come on, little buddy.
- Okay, big buddy.

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,837
See you tonight, guys.

131
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,134
- You can stop smiling now.
- Ah.

132
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:36,139
So anyway, after a fantastic lunch...

133
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,767
...I was whisked off
to the People magazine photo shoot...

134
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,936
- Have any of you been to a photo shoot?
- No.

135
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,896
It's fantastic.

136
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,816
Apparently, the camera loves me,
and I it.

137
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:52,656
They shot me in front of a starry
background where I posed like this:

138
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,496
They're going to digitally add
a supernova.

139
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,666
They say it's the perfect metaphor
for my incandescent talent.

140
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,879
Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas
that collapses upon itself.

141
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,716
Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor.

142
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,510
Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh.

143
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,512
They gave him an assistant?

144
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,599
If I want a new pen,
I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.

145
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,561
Have we at this point
met our social obligations?

146
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,812
Not yet.

147
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,399
Okay, put it on my calendar, but start
thinking of a reason why I can't go.

148
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,068
Alrighty? Koothrappali out.

149
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,361
God bless that boy.

150
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,781
- Don't know what I'd do without him.
- You just got him this afternoon.

151
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,951
Yes, but I'm finding
that having a lackey suits me.

152
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,329
- A lackey?
- I'm sorry, is that politically incorrect?

153
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,165
In India, we just call them untouchables.

154
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,210
- Now?
- Almost.

155
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,463
Speaking of untouchables,
I've got great news for you guys.

156
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,344
People magazine is having a reception
Saturday, and I managed to get you invited.

157
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,055
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

158
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,683
Of course, I couldn't get you
into the VIP section...

159
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:06,855
...because, you know, that's for VIPs,
and you guys are just, you know, P's.

160
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,317
There's a tribe in Papua New Guinea...

161
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:13,945
...where when a hunter flaunts his success
to the rest of the village...

162
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:18,241
...they kill him and drive away evil spirits
with a drum made of his skin.

163
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:22,912
Superstitious nonsense, of course,
but one can see their point.

164
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,505
Here you go, Raj.
You might wanna drink this one slowly.

165
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,925
Okay. So Saturday night,
can I count on my posse?

166
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,304
Gee, I'd love to, Raj, but I can't make it.

167
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,889
Oh, okay. Leonard?

168
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,141
Well, uh...

169
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,686
No, I could... No.

170
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,940
- Sheldon?
- I can make it, but I won't.

171
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:55,403
- What are you talking about?
- The reception for my article on Saturday.

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,613
You guys aren't going?

173
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,909
I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.

174
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,577
You're not gonna be there?

175
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,206
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...

176
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,668
...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.

177
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,130
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.

178
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,467
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine...

179
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,970
...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.

180
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,932
Would you like to go with me?

181
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,184
Of course I would. I would be honored.

182
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,727
Really? Cool.

183
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,063
Shame on you guys.

184
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,777
Look at that, I got a date with Penny.

185
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,238
I can't believe it took you a whole year.

186
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,825
- Now?
- Now.

187
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,458
Hey, buddy.
I'm gonna be in People magazine.

188
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,294
Yeah, call me when you're on the cover.

189
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,433
Oh, Raj, look at you.

190
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,146
I know. I'm resplendent
like the noonday sun, am I not?

191
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,567
Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?

192
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,570
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.

193
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,281
I just love saying "limo." Here.

194
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,409
- Sip on this while you're getting ready.
- Oh, I'm ready.

195
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,870
That's what you're wearing?

196
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,832
Um, yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?

197
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:36,713
Nothing. I was just hoping for something
a little more, you know, ridonkulous.

198
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,015
Yeah. Well, this is all the "donkulous"
you're gonna get tonight.

199
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,226
Okey-dokey. Let's roll.

200
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:53,021
All right, it's time to raise the roof.
Ooh-ooh.

201
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,690
Hey, Leonard.

202
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,941
- Hey.
- Dude.

203
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,695
- You look very nice.
- Thank you.

204
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,365
- Come on. Good night, Leonard.
- Good night.

205
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:08,203
- Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs?
- Yeah.

206
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,955
It's bigger than the house
my grandfather grew up in.

207
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,791
- Terrific.
- It has more food too.

208
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,376
All right. Come on, come on.

209
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,378
I'm coming up

210
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,881
So you better get this party started

211
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,717
I'm coming up
I'm coming up, yeah

212
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,888
I'm coming up
So you better get this party started

213
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,431
- Hey.
- Hey, good news.

214
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,642
You don't have to sulk
about Penny anymore.

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,063
There are hundreds of Croatian women
just waiting for you to contact them.

216
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,942
"Anything-for-a-Green-Card.com"?

217
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,322
I'll lend you my username.
It's Wealthy Big Penis.

218
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,243
- You're joking.
- You gotta make it easy for them.

219
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,578
They're just learning English.

220
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,497
Pass.

221
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,833
You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,753
...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?

223
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,923
It's not a date and that's racist.

224
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,427
It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on The Simpsons.

225
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,138
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

226
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,184
With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.

227
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,440
Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?

228
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,776
- Yes.
- Even though the menu specifies shredded?

229
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,361
- Yes.
- Brown rice, not white?

230
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,864
- Yes.
- Did you stop and get the hot mustard?

231
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,157
- Yes.
- Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?

232
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,742
- Yes.
- Thank you.

233
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,452
You're welcome.

234
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,413
What took you so long?

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,293
- Just sit down and eat.
- Fine.

236
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,965
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?

237
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,301
I want you to check
before you accept the order.

238
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,094
Sorry.

239
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,722
Were you distracted
by the possibility...

240
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,725
...that Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?

241
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,396
He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.

242
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,481
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.

243
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:07,572
You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.

244
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,658
Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.

245
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,953
That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region...

246
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,915
...home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.

247
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,584
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?

248
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,086
No.

249
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,214
Anyway, when I was 8...

250
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:30,094
...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.

251
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,431
- "Lucky"?
- Yes, "Lucky."

252
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,267
He's irony impaired. Just move on.

253
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,854
Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.

254
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,689
While others mourned Lucky...

255
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:46,152
...I realized his untimely demise provided
me with the opportunity to replace him...

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,613
...with something
more suited to my pet needs.

257
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,449
A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...

258
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:55,536
...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.

259
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,666
So not a puppy?

260
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,668
Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.

261
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,462
I wanted a griffin.

262
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,133
- A griffin?
- Yes, half eagle, half lion.

263
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,303
And mythological.

264
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,472
Irrelevant.

265
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,558
Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...

266
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,811
...and I was confidant
I could create one...

267
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,732
...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.

268
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,988
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.

269
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:37,745
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story...

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,414
...but what's your point?

271
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:45,044
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on
to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...

272
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,840
...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.

273
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,010
You wanna breed a new friend?

274
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,096
That's one option, but who has the time?

275
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,056
But consider this.

276
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,768
The Japanese, they're doing some
wonderful work with artificial intelligence.

277
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,148
Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.

278
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:09,944
Next thing you know, we're playing "Halo"
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.

279
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,198
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.

280
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,203
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.

281
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,290
For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.

282
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:27,920
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.

283
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,883
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.

284
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:38,139
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.

285
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,141
You know, a guy who has your back.

286
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,978
He should have money and live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.

287
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,316
- He should share our love of technology.
- And he should know a lot of women.

288
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,694
Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.

289
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,490
Our new friend is going to be Iron Man.

290
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,536
I can go all night

291
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,164
If you know what I mean

292
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,084
Welcome to the Raj Mahal.

293
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,336
Yes, it's very nice. Good night, Raj.

294
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,505
- Wait, the evening's not over.
- Yes, it is.

295
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,342
No, it's time to put on some R. Kelly
and suck face.

296
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,178
Oh, wow, is the evening over.

297
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,182
Wait, wait, wait. That's my mommy
and daddy calling from India.

298
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,850
I want you to meet my parents.

299
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,477
Wait, meet them?

300
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,984
Hello, Mommy, Daddy. Good to see you.
How are you? I'm not drunk.

301
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,488
- Why would you say that?
- Just making conversation.

302
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,783
Mommy, Daddy, I want you to meet
my new squeeze, Penny.

303
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,869
I am not your squeeze.
There is no squeezing.

304
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,539
I can't see her. Center her in the frame.

305
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,958
Here you go. Cute, huh?

306
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,627
She's not Indian.

307
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,255
So she's not Indian.
The boy's sowing some wild oats.

308
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,842
No, no, no, there's no sowing,
no squeezing and no sucking face.

309
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,469
What if he gets her pregnant?

310
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,181
Is this hotsy-totsy who you want
as the mother of your grandchildren?

311
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:05,393
What right do you have
to pick whom I can have children with?

312
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,812
Look, Rajesh, I understand,
you're in America...

313
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,356
...you want to try the "local cuisine."

314
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:14,485
But trust me,
you don't want it for a steady diet.

315
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,407
Now, you listen to me. I am no longer
a child and I will not be spoken to like one.

316
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,577
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go throw up.

317
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,081
- What's wrong with him?
- I don't know.

318
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,834
Maybe it's the local cuisine.

319
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,758
Okay, well, it's nice to meet you.

320
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,428
Just gonna set you on down over here.

321
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:44,348
And I'm gonna leave, so namaste.

322
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,771
And FYI, you'd be lucky
to have me as a daughter-in-law.

323
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,775
She's feisty.

324
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,777
I like that.

325
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,749
Raj, what are you doing?

326
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,838
No, no notes.
If you have something to say to me, say it.

327
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,813
Sorry.

328
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,817
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
