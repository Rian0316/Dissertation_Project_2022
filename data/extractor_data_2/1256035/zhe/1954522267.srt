Let's see,Raj was the kung pao chicken.

Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
小虾米配龙虾酱是谁的?

6
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,910
That would be me. Come to
pa,you un-kosher delight.
我的 来让老爸爽爽 好久没犯戒了
(不吃虾是犹太教戒律之一)

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,320
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.
我不是光指虾虾哦

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,180
Sit over there.

- Really,don't.
- Why...

- 为啥要再问...

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,980
Hot air blowers are incubators and
spewers of bacteria and pestilence.
干手机藏污纳垢 然后都喷到你手上

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,800
Frankly,it'd be more hygienic if they just had
a plague-infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
坦白说 让得瘟疫的长臂猿来把我手喷干
都比那要来得卫生

the most amazing news...
嘿 大伙们 我有惊世奇闻...

to talk in front of me without being drunk?
哟 Raj 你觉得你还有可能

Penny,you don't have to do that.

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,660
Oh,it's okay,between him not
talking,him talking and him...

It's pretty cool.

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,670
They've got me in with a guy who's doing
something about hunger in Indonesia,
除了我 还有为印尼饥荒奔波游走的

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,930
and a psychotherapist who's using
dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners,

the telescope camera mounting bracket you used?

heartwarming and personal narrative

gynecologist. He drives a Bentley.
你还贫困? 你老爸是妇科医生
还开宾利跑车呢

47
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,880
It's a lease.

48
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,360
I'm confused.

that's been traipsing around the solar
system for billions of years more noteworthy

good news and we weren't very supportive.

How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?
要是作为朋友的我们 总是降低他成功的门槛
Raj怎么可能真正取得伟大的成就呢?

father a "World's Greatest Dad" coffee mug
十一岁时 我姐姐给老爸买了个咖啡杯
上面写着"世上最棒的老爸"

until the day he died.

He can feel sadness?

00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,770
Not really. It's what you and
I would call condescension.
不是这样啦 我和你都管这叫优越感

Well,then fake it. Look at me.
好 那就装吧 你看我

90
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,590
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount
我都能慢慢接受这个事实
要知道 没有我的固定架

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,630
he never would have found that
stupid,little clump of cosmic schmutz.

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,840
But I'm bigger than that.

lunch in the president's dining room?
Koothrappali博士

I didn't even know there was
a president's dining room.
我都不知道还有校长餐厅

133
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,040
It's the same food as

I was whisked off to the
Peoplemagazine photo shoot...

Apparently,the camera loves me and I,it.
显然 相机同我惺惺相惜

background where I posed like this.
他们给我弄了个星光熠熠的背景

They're going to
digitally add a supernova.

Right,a ball of hot,flaming
gas that collapses upon itself.
没错 一团滚烫的火球 最终自取灭亡

They gave him an assistant?
给他派了个助手?

150
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,780
If I want a new pen,I have to
go to the bank with wire cutters.
我只是要一支新的钢笔

00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,940
Have we at this point met
our social obligations?

Not yet.

Oh,I'm sorry. Is that
politically incorrect?

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,640
In India,we just call them untouchables.

- Now?
- Almost.

spirits with a drum made of his skin.

you're not even going to be there to support him?
Raj要庆祝如此巨大的成就
你们居然不去捧场?

182
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,980
A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary
body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth
巨大成就 是指他发现的星体正坠向地球

183
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,910
and he exploded it with his mind.

Look at that,I got a date with Penny.
