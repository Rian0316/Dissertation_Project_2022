00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:04,039
2013年春天
In the spring of 2013,

2
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:06,823
巴尼和罗宾距喜结连理只有几周之遥了
Barney and Robin were just weeks away from tying the knot.

3
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:09,342
可在某些大事上 他们还未做决定
But there were still some pretty big issues they hadn't agreed on.

4
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:11,344
领养
Adoption.

5
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:12,496
我不知道啊
I don't know.

6
00:00:12,498 --> 00:00:14,498
只有领养才说得通
It's the only thing that makes sense.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,033
我真的不敢相信你会不接受
I can't... I can't believe you're not open to it.

8
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:19,286
好吧 那就试试吧
Okay. Let's try it.

9
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,006
不行 竖着的第27个词就不合适了
Nope, it doesn't work with 27 down.

10
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,659
嘿 考虑到咱婚礼快到了
Hey, with the wedding so close,

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,378
也许我们该讨论下
maybe we should talk about

12
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,796
结婚后住在哪儿吧
where we're going to live.

13
00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:31,131
好吧 够了
Fine, enough.

14
00:00:31,133 --> 00:00:32,165
不用求我了
Stop begging.

15
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,166
我们就住这儿
We'll live here.

16
00:00:33,168 --> 00:00:34,184
但这算你欠我的
But you owe me.

17
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,552
是啊 我说不清
Yeah, I don't know...

18
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:36,720
就是我不是完全喜欢
there's just a lot of things

19
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:39,005
你公寓里的一些东西
I don't totally love about your apartment.

20
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:40,357
比如什么
Like what?

21
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:42,342
好吧 举个例子
Well, for example, why is

22
00:00:42,344 --> 00:00:45,145
为什么你的床好像放在类似铁轨的东西上
your bed on what look like train tracks?

23
00:00:46,148 --> 00:00:49,399
你太厉害了
You were wonderful.

24
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:53,019
要是连如何取悦女人都不知道
Well, you don't get to be a state-certified orgasmologist

25
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,687
怎么能成为获得国家认可的高潮大师呢
without learning how to please a woman.

26
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,990
你不介意我留下来过夜吧
You don't mind if I spend the night, do you?

27
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:58,959
呃 不这样的话
Um, how else are we gonna

28
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:00,994
我们怎么能更深一步地了解对方呢
get to know each other on a deeper level?

29
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:02,696
不好意思
Excuse me,

30
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:05,549
我得把今晚的高潮报告上交给董事会
I just have to log tonight's orgasms with the licensing board.

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,187
墙的另外一面究竟是什么
What-what is on the other side of the wall?

34
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,388
那些小妞们都去哪了
Where do the hos go?

35
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,857
我哪知道 你以为我是装修公司啊
What am I, a contractor?

36
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,779
我们的婚姻要有个崭新的开端
We-we need to go into this marriage with a fresh start.

我爱你
I love you.

39

如果那能让你高兴的话
And if that will make you happy,

40
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:44,371
咱就找吧
then let's do it.

41
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:51,578
喔 那我得在一个我没睡过妞的地方找个公寓
Wow, so we need to find an apartment where I haven't banged someone?

42
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,152
你觉得克利夫兰怎么样
How do you feel about Cleveland?

43
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:53,997
哈 哈
Ha, ha.

44

在哪儿呢
Where is it?

92
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:52,081
我负担太大了
Is it a strain,

93
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:53,566
时不时感觉自己就像一个单亲爸爸
feeling like a single dad at times?

94

的确 但是莉莉正努力在新工作领域站稳脚跟
Sure, but Lily's been busting her butt at this new job.

还是没能把我的香槟都炸出来
but it soaked up none of the champagne.

99
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:03,843
{\a6}{\fs16}鱼子酱配香槟会有口中噼噼啪啪的响个不停的美妙感

100
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:05,595

时辰已至 吾将赠与你
it is time for me to bestow on you...

149
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:45,695
我们就不能像正常人那样面对面交流吗
Can we just talk face-to-face like normal people?

150
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,697
泰德 你就
Ted, just...

151
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,015
配合一下
just...

152
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:51,367
好吗
okay?

153
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:53,069
吾儿
My son,

154
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,355
时辰已至 吾将赠与你
it is time for me to bestow on you...

155
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,660
把门关上
Close the door.

156
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:01,628
不 这也
No. This is...

157
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,195
我的天啊 你就不能好好的
Oh, my God, can you just be cool?

158
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,864
哪怕一次 求你了
Once? Please?

159
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:06,382
就这一次
Just once?

160
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,551
配合一下会死吗
Can you just once be cool?

161
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:09,836
就一次
Once?

162
00:06:09,838 --> 00:06:11,537
求你了
Please?

163
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:18,594
吾儿
My son...

164
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,979
许多年来
for many years

165
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:24,600
这套公寓都是我巴尼超人的孤独堡垒
this apartment has been my Fortress of Barnitude.

166
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,736
但现在是时候让我
But now the time has come

167
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:28,354
把它传下去了
for me to pass it on.

168
00:06:29,073 --> 00:06:32,058
不久 这个地方就会变成
Soon, this place will become

169
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,394
你的"泰德超人的孤独堡垒"
your "Fortress of Soli-Ted."

170
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:36,729
巴尼 哪怕你用
Barney, I wouldn't

171
00:06:36,731 --> 00:06:39,198
普瑞来 阿莫西林和圣水刷洗这里的每一个角落
live here even if you scrubbed every inch of this place

172
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,484
我也不会住进来
with Purell, amoxicillin and holy water.

173
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,484
{\a6}Purell 普瑞来 美国洗手液品牌

174
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,537
好吧
Fine.

175
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,405
但我觉得我们都同意
But I think we can both agree,

176
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,008
如果能用乔•艾尔摄像机能让我的
it would be totally awesome to see 

177
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,961
那玩意儿漂浮在空中绝对是好棒的
my deal floating around all huge-like on the big Jor-El cam.

178
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,763
等一下
Hold on.

179
00:06:53,765 --> 00:06:56,632
现在堡垒里有点冷
Now, it's a little cold here in the Fortress,

180
00:06:56,634 --> 00:06:57,633
所以别因为这个
so don't judge...

181
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:58,751
泰德 等等
Ted, wait.

182
00:06:58,753 --> 00:07:00,386
你做了什么
What did you...

183
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:02,772
你把... 好了 这样不好玩
That's... okay, that's not funny.

184
00:07:02,774 --> 00:07:03,773
泰德 开门
Ted, open the...

185
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:06,025
呃 墙壁在向我逼近
Uh... walls closing in.

186
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:07,694
我没法呼吸了
I can't... can't breathe.

187
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,262
必须
Must...

188
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,365
展示那玩意
show deal...

189
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,317
用乔•艾尔摄像机
on Jor-El cam...

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,601
我...
I...

191
00:07:17,055 --> 00:07:18,905
这样看来我只好永远保留这套公寓了 晚安
Oh, well, guess I'm keeping this place forever, good night.

192
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:20,606
等等 给我等一下 这样就完了
Wait a... wait a minute, that's it?

193
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,492
泰德没兴趣买你的公寓
Ted wasn't interested in buying your apartment,

194
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:24,160
你就放弃了吗
so you just gave up?

195
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,445
巴尼 我抛弃了自己
Barney, I gave up my

196
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:27,830
位于曼哈顿上西区的
beautiful two-bedroom apartment

197
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,716
不用交房租的两室公寓
on the Upper West Side that was rent-free

198
00:07:29,718 --> 00:07:32,618
房东还亲自手洗我的高档衣服
and the landlord hand-washed all my delicates.

199
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,921
这可能是我不用交房租的原因
Which is probably why it was rent-free.

200
00:07:34,923 --> 00:07:36,506
重点是
The point is,

201
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:37,957
我所有内衣都要重新买
I need to buy all new underwear,

202
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,893
你也答应我们一起换个新地方住
and you agreed that we would find a new place together.

203
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,128
天啊 巴尼
Oh, God, Barney,

204
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,131
恋爱是需要互相信任和妥协的
relationships are about trust and compromise.

205
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,315
你不能只是
You can't just...

206
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:47,600
啊 你死定了
Oh, you are so dead.

207
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,152
别让我找到方法出来
If I ever figure a way out of here,

208
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,770
我会让你生不如死的
I will make your life a living...

209
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,973
我和莉莉真的很需要出去约个会
Lily and I really need this night out.

210
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:55,992
丰盛精致的晚餐和芭蕾表演
A big fancy dinner and the ballet.

211
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,827
谢谢你能帮忙照顾孩子
Thank you so much for babysitting.

212
00:07:57,829 --> 00:07:59,996
嘿 一小时三刀呢 谢谢你才对
Hey, three bucks an hour, thank you.

213
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,484
喂 宝贝
Oh, hey, baby.

214
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,819
我正要出门
Yeah, I'm just on my way out.

215
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,704
如果你早到了
If you get there before...

216
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:10,173
别这样 不是吧
Come on, really?

217
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,593
之后见
I'll see you later.

218
00:08:13,595 --> 00:08:15,445
船长吗
Captain?

219
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,796
真遗憾 兄弟 不过 
I'm sorry, dude. But, hey,

220
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,014
你可以这样想
look at it this way:

221
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:19,766
至少你不用去看芭蕾表演了啊
now you don't have to go to the ballet.

222
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:21,267
把你脑袋从菊花里拔出来使一下好吗 泰德
Get your head out of your ass, Ted.

223
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,469
根本就没有什么芭蕾表演
There was no ballet.

224
00:08:22,471 --> 00:08:24,691
我们就打算溜进你公寓来一炮
We were gonna sneak into your apartment and bang.

225
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,273
好吧 知道有什么可以
Well, you know what might

226
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,308
让我们忘掉这些烦心事吗
take both our minds off that?

227
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,360
稍稍看一集
A little, uh...

228
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:33,179
伍德沃斯庄园
Woodworthy Manor.

229
00:08:35,032 --> 00:08:36,315
不 这不行
No, I-I-I can't.

230
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,450
我答应过莉莉
I-I promised Lily

231
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:38,785
要等着她一起看的
that I would wait and watch it with her.

232
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,319
要是我先看了 就好像背叛了她一样
And I feel like I'd be cheating on her.

233
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,455
好吧好吧 我懂的
Sure, sure, sure, sure, I get all that.

234
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,457
只不过
It's just, um...

235
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,243
你要知道 今晚他们终于要找出那个
You know, tonight they're gonna finally reveal

236
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,378
而陷害扫烟囱工说他偷了庄园主人
who framed the chimney sweep

237
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,799
斯塔德夏尔的鹅莓的凶手了
for stealing Lord Stoutshire's gooseberries.

238
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:55,334
还要角逐出
And reveal the winner of

239
00:08:55,336 --> 00:08:57,587
当地园艺大赛的冠军
the local gardening competition.

240
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:58,888
我完全猜不透他们怎样才能
I don't know how they're going to pack

241
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,756
把这么多剧情集中到一集里面
all that action into one episode.

242
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,981
啊哦
Oops.

243
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,884
不行啊 泰德
No, Ted, you know

244
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:14,320
-我答应了莉莉  -嘘 别说话
-I promised Lily, I... -Shh, shh, shh.

245
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,322
顺其自然吧
Just let it happen.

246
00:09:16,324 --> 00:09:18,741
这周晚些时候 巴尼回家时发现
Later that week, Barney came home to discover

247
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,577
罗宾给他准备了一个小惊喜
that Robin had a little surprise waiting for him.

248
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,668
-含羞草吗  -是啊
-Mimosas? -Mm-hmm.

249
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,668
{\a6}Mimosas 因为颜色像含羞草而命名的鸡尾酒

250
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,704
刚烤的饼干的香味
Freshly-baked cookie smell?

251
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:34,240
还有穿红色运动衣的中年妇女
A middle-aged woman in a red blazer?

252
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:36,575
我明白了
I see what this is.

253
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,045
你总算同意我纵酒狂欢啦
You finally green-lit my orgy idea!

254
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:40,246
真好
Okay.

255
00:09:40,248 --> 00:09:42,048
这是场家庭招待会 巴尼
It's an open house, Barney.

256
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,550
跟你的堡垒说再见吧
Say good-bye to your fortress.

257
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:46,769
要不是因为我们要狂欢
If we weren't about to have an orgy,

258
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,587
我肯定会对你发火的
I'd be so mad at you right now.

259
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,583
如果你们跟随我到卧室
If you'll follow me into the bedroom,

260
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,593
会看到很棒的实木家具哦
I'll show you some beautiful woodwork.

261
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,070
我现在太生气 都懒得吐槽 曾有多少无知少女
I am way too upset right now to point out how many women

262
00:09:59,072 --> 00:10:00,771
在卧室里见过很棒的"实木家具"
have seen some beautiful woodwork in there.

263
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:00,771
{\a6}也指小鸡鸡

264
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:02,289
愤怒自我击掌
Angry self five!

265
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,290
啊
Rah!

266
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,492
罗宾
Robin,

267
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:05,893
我不允许你卖掉公寓
I did not agree to this.

268
00:10:05,895 --> 00:10:06,994
你必须允许
Yes, you did.

269
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:08,996
我搬出我的公寓
That is why I gave up my apartment.

270
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:11,782
不是为了住进一个病菌滋生
Not so I could live in a disease-riddled bang pad

271
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,834
上门荡妇阴魂不散的淫窝
haunted by the ghosts of your ex-skanks.

272
00:10:15,337 --> 00:10:17,938
浴室是意大利大理石的哟
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

273
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:20,774
你好啊 老兄
Hello, old bean.

274
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:22,209
今晚棒极了 对吧
Jolly good evening, isn't it?

275
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,277
你们在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

276
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,796
而且你说话怎么跟麦当娜似的
And why do you sound like Madonna?

277
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:27,097
罗宾让我们都来转转
Uh, Robin asked us all to come here

278
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,600
假装我们是很喜欢这公寓的潜在买主
and pretend that we are prospective buyers who love this apartment.

279
00:10:29,602 --> 00:10:31,352
我受到伍德沃斯庄园中
And inspired by a character

280
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:33,637
一个角色的启发 决定扮演
on Woodworthy Manor, I've decided to play

281
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,356
埃姆斯布瑞•波斯尔思韦特

282
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:39,276
一位帅气迷人内心却厌恶自己生活的板球运动员

283
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:40,945
你没必要当什么板球运动员
You don't have to be a cricket player.

284
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,530
跟埃姆斯布瑞的爸爸说去吧
Tell that to Emsbry's father.

285
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:43,864
抱歉
Sorry!

286
00:10:43,866 --> 00:10:45,416
我来了
Oh...

287
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:48,202
我去看了些地铁流浪汉的涂鸦作品
I was checking out some mole people's graffiti art

288
00:10:48,204 --> 00:10:50,171
我的披肩还被地铁勾住了
and my cape got caught on the F train.

289
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:51,172
来
Oh.

290
00:10:51,174 --> 00:10:52,423

他叫什么名字啊
What's his name?

00:10:56,712 --> 00:10:57,828
马尔文
Marvin.

294
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,779
为了纪念我父亲
For my father.

295
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,497
噢 这好贴心啊
Oh, that's so sweet.

296
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:03,217
你们俩已经在这一带看很多公寓了吗
Have you two been looking at a lot of places in this neighborhood?

297
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:04,518
噢 事实上他们不是...
Oh, actually they're not...

298
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,887
是 我们看过了
Yes, we have.

299
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:08,338
什么
What?

300
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,226
我跟我丈夫埃姆斯布瑞爱死这一片地区了
My husband Emsbry and I just love this area.

301
00:11:12,228 --> 00:11:14,845
我是一位帅气迷人内心却厌恶自己生活的板球运动员
I'm a cricket player who secretly hates his life.

302
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:17,648
你在干什么啊
What are you doing?

303
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,817
鉴于你再一次迟到了
Well, you were late yet again,

304
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,702
我决定和泰德做一次角色扮演
and so I'm gonna do this little scene study with Ted.

305
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:24,121
你问为什么 因为他随时在我身边
Why? Because he's there for me.

306
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,658
假装你结婚了
Pretending you're married?

307
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,494
这离你要证明的观点也太远了吧
That's going a little far to prove your point, isn't it?

308
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:32,963
打扰一下 但是你说同性恋情侣们结婚
Excuse me, but I think it's offensive to suggest

309
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:35,916
只是为了证明某种观点也太无礼了吧
the only reason gay people get married is to prove a point.

310
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:38,201
不×5
No, no, no, no, no.

谢谢你 姐们 看来需要找人来给

这位女士的思想安一块倒车镜
to get this lady's mind a rearview mirror

314
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,877
因为她的思维在倒退
because she is thinking in reverse. Mm-hmm.

315
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,565
恨就一个字 我只说一次
Hate is a four-letter word.

316
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:53,550
我没有 我投票给了...
I didn't... I voted for...

317
00:11:57,072 --> 00:11:58,739
噢 这是安全系统的一部分吗
Oh, is this part of a security system?

318
00:11:58,741 --> 00:11:59,940
算是吧
Sort of.

319
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:02,225
它和门口的擦鞋垫是连起来的 你看

00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:06,664
在这个面板里面
Under those layers,

323
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,065
可能有个不幸的消息等着你
an unwelcome surprise could await you.

324
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,251
在擦鞋垫下面我藏了一个
The scale with body fat calculator

325
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:12,453
人体脂肪测量秤
I've hidden under the welcome mat

326
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:15,072
可以确保我不会睡让我后悔的妞
makes sure you never have banger's remorse.

'Cause there's only one kind of chubby you want in the bedroom.

330
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,080
我说的对吧 大家
Am I right, people?

331
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:26,267
这家伙知道我在说什么
This guy knows what I'm talking about.

332
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,387
不是我想教你和埃姆斯布瑞怎么养"你们的"孩子
I don't want to tell you and Emsbry how to raise your child,

333
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,023
但如果你一直让他打盹的话
but I think if you keep letting him nap,

334
00:12:33,025 --> 00:12:34,141
他会整夜睡不着的
he's gonna be up all night.

335
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,277
真是搞笑 听起来好像你最近有
Funny, you sound like someone who's been

336
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:38,145
陪着他入睡一样
around for his bedtime lately.

337
00:12:38,147 --> 00:12:40,731
嗯 有人能给这位女士一家店面
Uh, can somebody get this lady a storefront

338
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,433
好让她专注于自己的事情吗
'cause she needs to mind her own business, mm-kay?

339
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,986
你能歇会儿吗
Would you stop it?

340
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:48,539
噢 对 对 因为这是你的抉择
Oh, right, right, because it's a choice.

341
00:12:49,991 --> 00:12:51,792
你们知道什么不用抉择吗
You know what's not a choice?

342
00:12:51,794 --> 00:12:53,294
充满基情地享用这个厨房
Being gay for this kitchen.

343
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:56,413
打开方式有点不太对 重点是
That came out wrong-- the point is,

344
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,666
看看这个超赞的公寓吧
let's focus on this awesome apartment.

会爱死用这个来看维京人
would love to watch the Vikings never win a Super Bowl

349
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:12,680
在历史上从来没赢过的超级碗比赛

350
00:13:12,682 --> 00:13:14,932
-岂有此理  -别让她戳中了你的怒点
-How dare you. -Don't let her push your buttons.

351
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:17,318
对
Right.

我才不在意什么橄榄球赛呢
I don't care about football.

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,521
我永远都不想再一个人了
And I never want to be alone again.

453
00:17:28,523 --> 00:17:31,557
谢谢 巴尼 那真是
Thank you, Barney, that really...

454
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,609
然后我想起了超人第二部
But then I remembered in Superman II,

455
00:17:33,611 --> 00:17:36,362
超人为了露易丝•莱恩放弃了他的所有能力
Superman gave up all his powers to be with Lois Lane,

456
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,231
在那之后 老实说他就是个废人
and he was honestly kind of a vag after that.

457
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:40,015
哥们 能不能停一下
Oh, buddy, just quit while...

458
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,234
然后 超人第三部
Now, Superman III was

459
00:17:41,236 --> 00:17:42,568
简直就是一部灾难
a complete train wreck totally.

460
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,619
你想说什么
What's your point?

461
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,188
想说 我爱你
that I love you.

462
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,190
还有
And...

463
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,710
我要为你放弃我的公寓
I'm giving up my apartment for you.

464
00:17:50,712 --> 00:17:54,964
还有超人系列电影的水平参差不齐
And that the Superman films are uneven.

465
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,868
我真的很感动 巴尼 但是
I really appreciate that, Barney, but...

466
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,922
恭喜啊 你们入手了这间超赞的公寓
Congrats. You guys are getting a fantastic apartment.

467
00:18:02,924 --> 00:18:06,392
我知道这里的一些地方有一点点奇怪
I mean, I know some of the features are a little weird.

468
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:07,927
一点点吗
A little?

469
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:09,679
我们会把这里都扒光
We're gonna rip this thing

470
00:18:09,681 --> 00:18:11,013
拆成毛坯房
down to the studs.

471
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,765
我明白
I get it.

472
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:15,434
但是 我是说 还是有些值得保留的地方
But, I mean, some things might be worth saving.

473
00:18:15,436 --> 00:18:17,687
我可没看出来 没有
I don't see any. No.

474
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,989
你没看出来
You don't see any?

475
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:22,024
当然这里的一些东西是有些吓人
Sure some of the stuff in here is creepy,

476
00:18:22,026 --> 00:18:24,360
但也非常有才啊
but it's also brilliant.

477
00:18:24,362 --> 00:18:27,663
我是说 很多天才都有些古怪
I mean, a lot of geniuses were kind of pervy.

478
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,015
看看托马斯•爱迪生
Look at Thomas Edison

479
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,167
不然你以为灯泡怎么会是胸部的形状呢
why do you think that lightbulbs are boob-shaped?

480
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,786
好吧 我们要把这个地方彻底拆掉
Yeah, we're taking a wrecking ball to this place

481
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:37,406
建成个真正适合人类的地方
and turning it into something actually fit for humans.

482
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,793
失陪一下
Excuse me.

483
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:48,768
出去
Get out!

484
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,938
巴尼超人的孤独堡垒不卖了
The Fortress of Barnitude is no longer for sale.

485
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,390
还有你的老公一下午一直盯着我的屁股看
Also your husband has been staring at my ass

486
00:18:54,392 --> 00:18:58,027
所以别装高风亮节了
all afternoon so don't act all high-and-mighty.

487
00:18:58,029 --> 00:18:59,762
你拒绝了他们
You turned them down?

488
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:03,399
是啊 如果我要求你改变太多
Yeah. If I ask you to change too many things about yourself,

489
00:19:03,401 --> 00:19:06,535
你就不是我爱上的那个人了
you're not gonna be the man I fell in love with.

490
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:09,572
所以 我接受并欣赏你
Turns out, I accept and appreciate

491
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:14,076
包括你最猥琐 最可怕 最反社会的阴暗面
even the grossest, creepiest, most sociopathic parts of you.

492
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:18,714
某人刚才好像已经把结婚誓言写好了哦
Sounds like somebody just wrote her vows.

493
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,286
是船长
It's the Captain.

494
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,555
啊嗬
Ahoy.

495
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,290
中央公园的动物园里有一匹斑马
There's a zebra at the Central Park Zoo

496
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,593
有着对摄影非常敏锐的蹄子
who's got quite a keen hoof at photography.

497
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:32,795
说来好笑 他竟然对颜色很在行 现在
Ironically, he's great with color. Now...

498
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,015
船长 我会去看看的 但不是今晚
Captain, I'll check it out, just not tonight.

499
00:19:36,017 --> 00:19:38,901
我需要些时间陪陪我的丈夫
I need to spend some time with my husband.

500
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:41,303
你确定吗
You sure?

501
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,806
我知道 我这样忙于工作 你挺不容易的
I know it's been tough, me working this much,

502
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:47,976
我估计自己对艺术家气派的追求也有点过火了
and I guess I went a little overboard with the whole artsy thing.

503
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,245
我知道
I know.

504
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,413
你那披肩
The cape.

505
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:51,530
我的披肩怎么了
What about my cape?

506
00:19:51,532 --> 00:19:52,648
我很喜欢
I love it.

507
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,834
而且我知道 你热爱这份工作
And I... I know that you love this job.

508
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,452
我应该更支持你的 我只是想你了
I should be more supportive-- I just miss you.

509
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,337
我也想你
I miss you, too.

510
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,822

You guys are all so lucky.

513
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:06,762
我什么时候才能找到真爱呢
When am I gonna find something real?

514
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:10,049
埃姆斯布瑞 想不想试试和女人在一起是什么感觉
Well, Emsbry, ready to see what it's like to be with a woman?

515
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:14,270
万事总有第一次嘛
I suppose there's a first time for everything.

516
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:17,056
-去吧  -吾儿
-Go ahead. -My son.

517
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:29,881
你们确定我俩会喜欢伍德沃斯庄园吗
Are you guys sure we're gonna like this Woodworthy Manor show?

518
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:31,983
是啊 听起来有点无聊
Yeah, it sounds kind of boring.

519
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:34,386
有点无聊
Kind of boring?

520
00:20:34,388 --> 00:20:38,056
快点坐下吧 但相信我吧 绝对精彩得让你坐不住
Grab a seat guys, but trust me, you're only gonna need the edge.

521
00:20:38,908 --> 00:20:42,279
好了 先讲一段背景故事
Ah-ha, all right, now, a little backstory.

522
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,866
斯塔德夏尔小姐的槌球及踝靴事业已经发展壮大了
Lady Stoutshire has developed a serious case of croquet ankle

523
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:49,920
厨子布特布拉什夫人找不到足够的栗子
and the cook Mrs. Bootbrush can't find enough chestnuts

524
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,005
来喂圣克里斯宾节的鹅

一起看吧
Let's watch.

526
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:06,353
我爱你
I love you.

我手腕摔坏了
My wrist is broken.

528
00:21:07,356 --> 00:21:09,389

00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:11,391
