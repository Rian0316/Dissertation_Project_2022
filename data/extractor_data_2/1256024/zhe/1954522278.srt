1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,080
The problem appears to be unsolvable.
问题看来是解不出了

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,190
Maybe we could run some
computer simulations.
做电脑模拟试试呢

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,710
There are too many variables.
It would take forever.
变量太多 一辈子都弄不完

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,230
We've got to be missing something.
肯定漏下啥了

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,670
Let's start again.
咱重来一次

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:21,320
The movie is playing here at 7:20, here
at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.
电影在这是7:20上映 这是7:40
这是8:10 这里是8:45

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,190
- These theaters have to be eliminated.
- Why?
- 这些影院要排除掉
- 为啥?

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,050
They're state-of-the-art digital
projection, 20-channel surround sound.
这有最先进的数码放映机
20通路环绕立体声

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,320
Yes, but they have no Icee machines.
是 但那没有冰吸饮料机

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,600
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.
还无视我的写信抗议 顺便说一下

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,380
What about the multiplex
here? The seats are terrific.
这个多功能影厅怎么样? 座位舒服极了

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,380
They have Twizzlers
instead of Red Vines.
那的绳子糖是Twizzlers牌而不是Red Vines的

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,940
No amount of lumbar support
can compensate for that.
坐着腰部再舒服也无法弥补

14
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,320
Well, it's gonna take
at least an hour to eat,
吃饭至少要花上一小时

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,750
and I don't see a Sheldon-approved restaurant
proximate to a Sheldon-approved theater.
咋就找不到Sheldon许可餐厅
和Sheldon许可影院挨着那种呢

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,410
- We could eat after the movie.
- Unacceptable.
- 咱可以看完再吃
- 不可以

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,200
The delay would result in tomorrow
morning's bowel movement occurring at work.
晚吃饭的话 明早工作时该想排便了

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,520
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.
别急 别急 这有个7-11便利店

19
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:04,360
We smuggle Srpies, which are
essentially Icees, in under our coats,
我们把思乐冰雪泥藏衣服里带进去
就当做冰吸果饮

20
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,680
after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.
之前呢 先在这 这或这饱餐一顿

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't see how we missed that.
刚才咋没发现呢

22
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,860
Excuse me, in what
universe are Slurpies Icees?
打扰一下 啥时候思乐冰雪泥
成了冰吸果饮的一种了?

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,890
That's how we missed it.
所以没发现呗

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,510
Sheldon, would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis,
Sheldon 你能不能就破例一次

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,670
to create an emergency ad
hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?
紧急临时把这俩饮品等同看待?

26
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,460
Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.
哦 Leonard 你知道我做不到

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,550
Okay, I guess we only have one option.
好了 看来只有一个法子了

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,950
Yep, I don't see any way around it.
是啊 别无他法

29
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,390
- Bye, Sheldon.
- See ya.
- 拜 Sheldon
- 再见

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,060
Stay loose.
不用送

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,630
They're right, it was the only option.
他们没错 就这一个办法了

It was the only option.

I'm sorry, I don't understand
which social situation this is.

Could you give me some
guidance as to how to proceed?

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,730
The building manager's showing an apartment
downstairs, and I haven't paid my rent.

Penny 我好像不太喜欢私藏
北Los Robles公寓楼2311号逃犯

a little behind on my bills
没啥大不了的 我就是有点缺钱

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,770
because they cut back my hours at
the restaurant and my car broke down.
因为他们削减了我的上班时间

fine. It's still blinking away.

It's the stupid engine

It cost me like $1,200 to fix it.

9% of my after-tax income.
我的花销占我税后工资的46.9%
