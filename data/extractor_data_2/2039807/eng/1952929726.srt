1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:04,724
Oh, God, guys, I'm
still really hungover.

2
00:00:04,728 --> 00:00:06,094
Did I really
ruin a wedding?

3
00:00:06,096 --> 00:00:08,463
No, you didn't ruin
a wedding.

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:09,865
Just the reception.

5
00:00:09,867 --> 00:00:11,800
And the bar mitzvah next door.

6
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:13,485
And my dress.

7
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:15,737
And your dress. You put on
a dress at one point.

8
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:18,073
Okay, you know what,
that's it.

9
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,742
I'm about to be a dad,
and I want to be

10
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:23,394
the kind of man that my
child can look up to.

11
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:25,864
So, sweeping declaration--

12
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:30,168
I am never getting drunk again
as long as I live.

13
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:32,236
I'm serious.

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,723
<i>Kids, it's not that</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall</i>

15
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:36,024
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

16
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:38,143
But whenever he made a sweeping
<i>declaration like that,</i>

17
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:39,978
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

18
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,847
I did it again.

19
00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:45,133
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

20
00:00:46,352 --> 00:00:48,303
What happened
to your leg?

21
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,771
Oh, nothing.

22
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:51,473
I'm meeting Nora
for coffee.

23
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,892
She's still mad at me, so
I need some sympathy points.

24
00:00:53,894 --> 00:00:55,259
She likes musicals,
so I'm going

25
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:56,761
to tell her I fell off the stage

26
00:00:56,763 --> 00:00:58,480
during a performance
of <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

27
00:00:58,482 --> 00:00:59,597
What do you think?

28
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,232
Lose the cast.

29
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,868
A one-man show-- I like it!

30
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,071
Just so we're clear--

31
00:01:06,073 --> 00:01:09,291
this woman is mad at you
because you lied to her.

32
00:01:09,293 --> 00:01:12,077
So your solution is to pretend
you broke your leg?

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,162
You're right.

34
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:16,331
A neck brace.
Thanks, Lil.

35
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,633
Man, I wish I'd have talked
to you sooner.

36
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:20,268
I've been practicing
with these crutches all day

37
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,304
and whoever left them
in my lobby

38
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:23,421
probably really
needs 'em.

39
00:01:23,423 --> 00:01:25,623
Well, uh, I have
some good news.

40
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:29,010
As you all know, I recently
decided to get back out there

41
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:31,913
and start dating again.
And, uh, well...

42
00:01:35,568 --> 00:01:37,585
Is this you?

43
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:40,689
Uh, yeah. Hi.

44
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,823
I'm Ted.

45
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,091
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:43,093 --> 00:01:45,243
That's great, Ted.

47
00:01:45,245 --> 00:01:47,145
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment
of pure destiny.

48
00:01:47,147 --> 00:01:49,614
The kind you just
can't manufacture.

49
00:01:49,616 --> 00:01:51,649
Or so I thought.

50
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,655
Oh, no.
How did I get on there?

51
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,607
Hi. Ted Mosby.

52
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:01,826
Guilty.

53
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:03,628
Hi. Ted Mosby.

54
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,380
That is embarrassing.

55
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:09,601
I should be on the cover of
<i>Egg On My Face</i> magazine.

56
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,802
But I'm not.

57
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,937
I'm on the cover of this one.

58
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,090
Hi. Ted Mosby.

59
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,108
16 moments of pure destiny

60
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,811
in one day,
and of those 16,

61
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,896
ten were single.

62
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:25,066
Of those ten,
seven liked what they saw.

63
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,718
Of those seven,

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,686
four were women.

65
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,039
Of those four,

66
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,323
two gave me their real number.

67
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:35,126
And I have a date
with both of them.

68
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:36,911
Okay.

69
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:39,964
Guys,

70
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,599
it's Garrison Cootes.

71
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,551
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes</i>
<i>was a senior partner</i>

72
00:02:43,553 --> 00:02:45,203
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

73
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:46,755
<i>One of the biggest</i>
<i>environmental law firms</i>

74
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:48,189
<i>in America.</i>

75
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:50,258
<i>Marshall would have given</i>
<i>anything to work there.</i>

76
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,594
If I don't get this job,
I might end up working

77
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:53,812
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

78
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,313
And nobody wants that.

79
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:57,999
Or maybe you guys want that,
because you'll get free tacos,

80
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,350
'cause your my peeps.

81
00:02:59,352 --> 00:03:02,771
But right now I need
all of you to calm down!

82
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:06,491
Hello.

83
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:08,159
Marshall, this is
Garrison Cootes.

84
00:03:08,161 --> 00:03:09,994
Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner,

85
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,197
but I've just been swamped.

86
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:16,234
Which is funny,
'cause I'm literally

87
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:18,036
standing in a swamp.

88
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:23,041
Anyway, I'm just out here,
I'm just collecting some samples

89
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,243
for this pollution case
we're working on.

90
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:27,212
I love the work you guys do.
That's a croc...

91
00:03:27,214 --> 00:03:28,264
No, I mean it.

92
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,726
No, no, there's a crocodile
about five feet away from me.

93
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,267
So I'm just going to ignore

94
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,519
the hot urine filling
my waders as we speak,

95
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,921
and tell you that
we're very interested.

96
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:37,922
He's interested.

97
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,607
Obviously we have
to do some sort

98
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:41,893
of credit check, you know,
a criminal record

99
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,529
and Google search, but as long
as nothing unseemly turns up,

100
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,897
you're good to go, man.

101
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:47,816
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

102
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:49,200
Well, I gotta run.

103
00:03:50,871 --> 00:03:52,403
This is so funny,

104
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:56,207
because, actually, I physically
have to run now.

105
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,457
- Croc saw you?
- He's advancing, yeah.

<i>Thankfully, without</i>

110
00:04:17,929 --> 00:04:20,963
Hey, Nora, thanks
for meeting me here.

111
00:04:20,965 --> 00:04:22,114
What happened to your neck?

112
00:04:22,116 --> 00:04:24,533
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

113
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:27,869
I was performing in
a one-man show of <i>Fiddler.</i>

114
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:29,638
There was this roof.

115
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,857
Wow, that one has
fantastic ta-tas.

116
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:33,008
What, where?

117
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,226
Oh... Oh, damn it.

118
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,361
Ta-ta.

119
00:04:35,363 --> 00:04:37,546
Wait, Nora, wait...
No, look, please don't.

120
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

121
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:39,949
What is the matter with you?

122
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,984
What kind of person
needs to lie like that.

123
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:44,720
A person who really,
really likes you.

124
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:46,989
And suspects,
probably accurately,

125
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,574
that you're way
out of his league,

126
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:50,826
and so he feels the need to...

127
00:04:52,445 --> 00:04:54,029
I'm sorry, you were kidding

128
00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:55,414
about the fantastic
ta-tas, right?

129
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,554
'Cause I'm looking around
and I do not see 'em...

130
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,420
I just had two
back-to-back dates.

131
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:04,089
That's right,
two lovely ladies,

132
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:08,093
four large cappuccinos,
and... one sec.

133
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:12,264
And I don't know which
date was more awesome.

134
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,933
Let's meet the girls.

135
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:16,218
<i>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.</i>

136
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,753
<i>She's traveled</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

137
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:20,422
<i>Speaks four languages,</i>
<i>is a concert pianist.</i>

138
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:24,209
<i>And Claire reached</i>
<i>for the check.</i>

139
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,327
So I don't know.

140
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,662
It's a squeaker.

141
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:27,930
I mean, both
of these girls

142
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:30,783
have the potential to be
something really special.

143
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,737
They both move
on to the next round.

144
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:33,720
Wait a minute.

145
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,738
You're going to date
two girls at once?

146
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,489
Don't you think you should
just choose one

147
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,624
before it gets serious?

148
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:39,708
Define serious.

149
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,443
Well, that's complicated.

150
00:05:41,445 --> 00:05:43,829
I guess you have to weigh
expectations,

151
00:05:43,831 --> 00:05:45,080
emotional investments...

152
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:46,348
Third base.

153
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,750
Seriously, third base.

154
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:50,219
So I can go to second base with
both of these girls, no problem?

155
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,438
Oh, honk away, my friend.
Yeah, honk away.

156
00:05:53,122 --> 00:05:54,673
Oh, no.

157
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,875
Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned
<i>the background check,</i>

158
00:05:56,877 --> 00:05:58,944
<i>Marshall had been</i>
<i>scouring the Internet.</i>

159
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:01,397
<i>Most of what he found</i>
<i>was pretty harmless.</i>

160
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,633
<i>In some cases,</i>
<i>really awesome, until...</i>

161
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:05,768
Not good.

162
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,270
This-- this is not good.

163
00:06:09,138 --> 00:06:10,739
Thanks, Stacy.

164
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:12,992
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

165
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,943
thanks to the generous
endowment from--

166
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,328
Oh, ho-ho!

167
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,531
Did somebody say
generous endowment?

168
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:26,171
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you
can call me Beercules!

169
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:35,997
Well, that could
be anybody.

170
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,832
Oh, man, I forgot
about Beercules.

171
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,270
Who made this
Web site anyway?

172
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,715
- Pete Durkenson.
- Of course.

173
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,860
Is that the guy who convinced
you to run across campus naked?

174
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,778
I was pledging his frat,

175
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,863
which I gave up on
after three days,

176
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,349
because frats are stupid
and elitist

177
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,851
and also I found out
he wasn't in a frat.

178
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,903
Oh, my God.

179
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:04,205
This is awesome.

180
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,924
I just got invited
to the Architects' Ball,

181
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,377
the annual gala that honors
the city's greatest architects.

182
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:13,547
Oh, no, you guys see
why this sucks, right?

183
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,216
Because it's an annual gala

184
00:07:15,218 --> 00:07:16,801
honoring the city's
greatest architects?

185
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,521
Robin, this is the social event
of the year.

186
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,890
You take a girl
to the Architects' Ball,

187
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,259
brother, you're going
to third base.

188
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,560
Whichever girl

189
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:28,062
I take as my date,

190
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,981
she will be
Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

191
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,550
by the end of the night.

192
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,569
Okay, no more sitting
on the fence.

193
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:37,738
Robin, get me my legal pad.

194
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
It's pros and cons time!

195
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,345
And kids, they really cheered.

196
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:46,630
Let me make one thing
very clear to you.

197
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,600
I don't date guys who lie to me.

198
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,802
Well, see, I did not
know that.

199
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,953
My bad.

200
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,922
So, from here on in,
no more lies.

201
00:07:54,924 --> 00:07:57,825
I will never lie
to you again.

202
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,261
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

203
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:02,696
Okay.

204
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:03,764
Have you ever successfully

205
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:06,150
gotten a woman in bed
by lying to her?

206
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,769
Have I ever...

207
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,359
If I'm being totally honest...

208
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:18,863
Yes.

209
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,781
More than once?

210
00:08:20,783 --> 00:08:23,117
More than once...

211
00:08:23,119 --> 00:08:25,202
Wow, that's...

212
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,207
I guess if we're
splitting hairs,

213
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:34,044
then, technically...
there was a plurality

214
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:38,349
to the times I've lied to women
for sex having purposes.

215
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,567
What were they?

216
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:41,569
Nines and tens mostly.

217
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,220
There was a four once.

218
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,605
She was a slump buster.

219
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,225
But, Nora, after that, I had a
run that you would not believe.

220
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,694
Man, honesty feels good.

221
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,379
What were the lies?

222
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,982
You want me to tell you every
lie I've ever told a woman

223
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:56,150
to get her into bed?

224
00:08:56,152 --> 00:08:58,869
A bed or any other place
you had sex with her.

225
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,104
Oh, you're good.

226
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,457
Pete, Pete. Hey.

227
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,576
Beercules!

228
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:06,860
Bring it in, dude.

229
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:08,996
Hey, I've been
trying to call you,

230
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,364
like, all night.

231
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:11,632
Oh, my God, sorry.

232
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,634
I would have answered,
but it is Tuesday night.

233
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,468
It's Sunday.

234
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,253
And you know what that means.

235
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,339
"Edward Forty Hands."

236
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,407
<i>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"</i>

237
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:22,877
is a game that involves taping
<i>two 40-ounce bottles</i>

238
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,212
<i>of malt liquor to your hands.</i>

239
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,947
<i>The object is to finish</i>
<i>both bottle--</i>

240
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:28,849
<i>Oh, my God, why am</i>
<i>I telling you this?</i>

241
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,017
<i>Let's move on.</i>

242
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:33,553
Okay, you know that old video
of me streaking?

243
00:09:33,555 --> 00:09:35,722
I watch it every day.

244
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:38,576
Well, I need you to take it down
off the Internet.

245
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,994
Like, right now.

246
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,728
There are two ways
that can happen.

247
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,864
One, you can give me
$4 million,

248
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,084
or... you can help me
go to the bathroom,

249
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,586
because I... I can't...

250
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,456
Yeah, those are two
non-negotiable no's.

251
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,425
Well, I'm sorry we could not
do business together.

252
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,709
But if you'll excuse me,

253
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,095
I'm in the middle of a game
of "Edward Forty Hands,"

254
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,180
and the competition is fierce.

255
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,916
Who are you
playing with, anyway?

256
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:06,086
Just myself.

257
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:08,689
<i>Meanwhile, Barney continued</i>
<i>listing every lie</i>

258
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,940
<i>he'd ever told to get laid.</i>

259
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,376
There's no time to explain
how I got bit there.

260
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,511
I just need someone
to suck the poison out.

261
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,680
The surgeons gave me a new face,

262
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:17,698
honey.

263
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,333
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

264
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,069
<i>Me llamo David Beckham.</i>

265
00:10:22,071 --> 00:10:24,855
If I were
only casting <i>The White Swan</i>

266
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,156
the role would be yours.

267
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,359
No, I am a lesbian.

268
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,262
This thing that I'm wearing
is just really lifelike.

269
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,997
Okay, let's skip ahead.

270
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,131
What's the worst one?

271
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,416
The lowest of the low?

272
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,834
The creme de la creepy?

273
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:40,638
Uh... Oh, I once pulled
<i>The Soul Man.</i>

274
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,974
There was this beautiful girl
who only dated black guys...

275
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,778
Barnell!
Ooh, I knew it!

276
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,982
I can't decide.

277
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,484
They're both awesome.

278
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,287
If only architects had
two balls, right, Ted?

279
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,155
I got this.

280
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,657
Ted, left or right?

281
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,974
Yes, yes, great idea.

282
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:02,609
Let the fates decide, huh?

283
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,762
I will pick left.

284
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:05,946
Just call one of 'em.

285
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:06,947
Ugh!

286
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:08,282
Ted, deep in your heart,

287
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,584
you know that you
kind of like one

288
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,452
more than the other.

289
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,953
Trust me-- take the other.

290
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,956
Um, maybe I haven't
this is...

291
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,325
the Architects'
Ball, Robin.

292
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:19,426
It's a star-studded event.

293
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,661
Okay, name one celebrity
who's gonna be there.

294
00:11:21,663 --> 00:11:22,996
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

295
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:24,448
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

296
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,883
Yeah.
He's there every year.

297
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,101
And that guy's a rock star.

298
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,354
You know, Ted,
I've been thinking--

299
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,524
it's too soon to narrow it down
between these two girls.

300
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,641
Just take a friend.

301
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,478
Like I... I don't know,
maybe, uh, a friend

302
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,647
who had a poster of
Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

303
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,367
and may or may not
have, perhaps,

304
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,303
dated that poster, on and off,
throughout high school.

305
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:50,023
This pros and cons list
isn't cutting it.

306
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,360
I need a color chart.

307
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:55,579
Color chart! Color chart!

308
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,982
<i>And, kids,</i>
<i>we all really chanted.</i>

309
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,000
Pete, please.

310
00:12:00,002 --> 00:12:01,802
I'm unemployed.

311
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,087
I have a huge mortgage.

312
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:04,588
I have a baby on the way.

313
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,341
And now, I'm about
to lose a job I really need

314
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:09,226
because of a 15-year-old prank!

315
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,761
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

316
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,229
Beercules, what happened?

317
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,464
You're like a different person.

318
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,316
The guy in that video
was awesome.

319
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,902
He had potential.

320
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,188
He could have been president of
the frat one day.

321
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,856
There was no frat!

322
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,024
Now he's just a bummer.

323
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:26,226
It's not like I want
to be a bummer.

324
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,746
I just... I have to be.

325
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,230
I'm gonna be a dad.

326
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:31,498
You'll have kids someday.

327
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,616
You'll understand.

328
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,235
Dude, I have four kids.

329
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:38,405
Pete, please take
the video down.

330
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:41,425
All right, Beercules,
I'll take the video down.

331
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,876
If...

332
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:45,963
you can best me in
a game of my own choosing.

333
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,214
Oh, no...

334
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,683
And I select the beautiful game,

335
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,917
the sweet science...

336
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,719
Pete, please,
I'm so hungover...

337
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:53,804
...the sport of kings...

338
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,773
I don't want to play
"Edward Forty Hands."

339
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:56,923
I was gonna say darts--

340
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,726
but "Edward Forty
Hands" it is!

341
00:12:59,728 --> 00:13:02,529
And that concludes all
the space-related lies.

342
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,232
Let's move on to
the world of sports.

343
00:13:05,234 --> 00:13:08,202
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought
of another space one.

344
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,537
"I've been bitten
by a moon snake.

345
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,106
You need to suck all the
space poison out of my--"

346
00:13:13,108 --> 00:13:14,792
Okay, Barney, uh,

347
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,326
I have to be at work
tomorrow at 8:00,

348
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,995
which means I have
just about enough time

349
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,397
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,
hugging myself.

350
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,884
So this was fun.

351
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,102
Can I call you, or...?

352
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,255
Barney, you're funny, handsome

353
00:13:28,257 --> 00:13:29,923
and really quite clever.

354
00:13:29,925 --> 00:13:32,092
But you're also a sociopath.

355
00:13:32,094 --> 00:13:33,994
Well, I count three pros
and one con, so...

356
00:13:33,996 --> 00:13:36,480
How do you still think
you have a chance with me?

357
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,816
Because you sat
here all night.

358
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,968
You could've left right
away, but you didn't.

359
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:46,406
Look, Nora, all those lies--
that's the old me.

360
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,209
But I swear to you,
I am trying to change.

361
00:13:49,211 --> 00:13:53,113
You... make me want to change.

362
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:55,999
How do I know that's not a lie?

363
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,718
I'll prove it.

364
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,586
I will prove how serious I am.

365
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,322
I will not leave this diner

366
00:14:02,324 --> 00:14:05,526
until I get
a second date with you.

367
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:07,845
Good-bye, Barney.

368
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:09,680
I'm not kidding.

369
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,131
This is a 24-hour diner.

370
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:14,768
I'll stay here forever,
if I have to-- and I will!

371
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,338
Just water for me. Thanks.

372
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,644
Okay, so red indicates
level of attractiveness,

373
00:14:23,646 --> 00:14:26,113
blue--
intellectual stimulation,

374
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,698
green-- emotional connection,

375
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,350
yellow-- compatibility
of life goals,

376
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:33,853
and purple-- whether or not
she reached for the check.

377
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,290
Well, it looks like
Jessica's ahead

378
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,358
in the first
four categories.

379
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:43,063
Did not reach for the check...

380
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,700
Oh, this?

381
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:49,369
No big deal. This...

382
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:51,004
This cost three
months rent,

383
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:52,673
and, uh, I've never
gotten to wear it,

384
00:14:52,675 --> 00:14:55,509
because I bought it for that big
event that you invited me to,

385
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:57,043
which then fell through.

386
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,478
But, you know what?

387
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,097
Don't feel guilty about that.

388
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,064
What big event?

389
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,215
That thing with your uncle.

390
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:04,001
His funeral?

391
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:05,852
It didn't fall through,

392
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:07,354
he miraculously
came out of a coma.

393
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:09,156
And I forgive you.

394
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,742
Now, can I please
meet Lenny Kravitz?

395
00:15:15,062 --> 00:15:16,530
I did it again!

396
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:18,448
Aw, honey.

397
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,733
You got drunk again.

398
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:22,369
I can't believe
I took the over.

399
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:26,840
Just to be clear, "I did it
again" is not a reference...

400
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,409
to my current state of
inebriation.

401
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,578
What's it a reference to?

402
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,547
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

403
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:35,532
I'm 33 years old.

404
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:40,604
And if my potential future
employer, Garrison Cootes,

405
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,089
is watching this...

406
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:45,776
bow down to Beercules!

407
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,568
Well, that could
be anybody.

408
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,042
Oh, goodness.

409
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,333
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

410
00:16:12,334 --> 00:16:14,067
I'm gonna make this real simple:

411
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:15,919
You're gonna take down
that video of Marshall.

412
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,320
You know why?

413
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,373
Because I'm friends with three
girls who dated you in college,

414
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,875
and girls
tell each other everything.

415
00:16:22,877 --> 00:16:25,562
Every <i>tiny</i> detail.

416
00:16:25,564 --> 00:16:26,880
Huh. So...

417
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:32,235
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes
the little wee-wee clock.

418
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,220
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

419
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:35,939
No idea.
What's everyone getting?

420
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:39,109
This was bound to
happen eventually.

421
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:42,078
I've been trying so hard
to suppress, like,

422
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,730
my carefree idiot side,

423
00:16:43,732 --> 00:16:47,567
that it just rebelled
and came out swingin'!

424
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:48,735
It sure did.

425
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:51,121
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

426
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:54,291
Who am I kidding?
I'm not ready to be a dad.

427
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:57,127
I thought that I was,
but it's, like...

428
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,263
my dad never did stuff
like that, you know?

429
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:01,748
So what if he did?

430
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,633
You'd still love him.

431
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:07,270
And be honest-- wouldn't you
love to stumble onto a video

432
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:09,789
of him running down
the street naked, yelling,

433
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,524
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

434
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:14,044
I got an icicle on my deal!"

435
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:19,566
Oh! Hey, guys!

436
00:17:19,568 --> 00:17:21,267
Ow! My neck!

437
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:23,737
Uh... oh! Hey!

438
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,155
Look at that.

439
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:27,774
Barney, what are
you doing here?

440
00:17:27,776 --> 00:17:30,877
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave
until she gave me a second date,

441
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,162
and I mean it.

442
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:33,613
I've already been here
nine hours.

443
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:36,383
I still need
another minute.

444
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,636
I mean... call me crazy, but

445
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:42,238
I'm gonna stay here until
I get that girl back.

446
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:48,144
That-- that's
what I want.

447
00:17:49,063 --> 00:17:50,647
The way Barney
feels about Nora--

448
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:52,298
I want that feeling again.

449
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,185
I don't want to be choosing
between two girls,

450
00:17:55,187 --> 00:17:59,989
I want to be... a complete
head-over-heels idiot for one.

451
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,075
Yeah, the complete
head-over-heels idiot thing's

452
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:04,244
pretty nice.

453
00:18:05,329 --> 00:18:06,663
It's not bad.

454
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:09,449
Although, for the record--

455
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:12,919
sweeping declaration!--

456
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:17,841
I am never getting
drunk again.

457
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,777
<i>And sure enough...</i>

458
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,679
All hail Beercules!

459
00:18:24,066 --> 00:18:25,365
Yeah!

460
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:28,051
<i>But, again,</i>
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

461
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:38,361
Hello.

462
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:40,513
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.

463
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:41,681
Yes, Mr. Cootes.

464
00:18:41,683 --> 00:18:42,999
Hi. How are you?

465
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,951
I just wanted to let you know,
we did the background check,

466
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:47,654
and that is
some disturbing streaking.

467
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:49,456
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...

468
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:51,524
The rainbow streaking
in this sample

469
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:53,376
is definitely
from chemical runoff.

470
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:55,528
Oh, I...

471
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,531
Bottom line-- we'd love to have
you on board.

472
00:18:58,533 --> 00:18:59,549
That is fantastic!

473
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,701
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!

474
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:02,702
Well, you're welcome.

475
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:04,504
And-- oh, and when
you're at the office,

476
00:19:04,506 --> 00:19:06,756
try to wear some clothes,
okay, Beercules?

477
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,393
Wow! That's a big snake.

478
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:11,561
Oh, there's
a snake in the swamp?

479
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:13,012
No, I'm talking about
your penis.

480
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:14,330
See you tomorrow.

481
00:19:15,883 --> 00:19:16,766
I got the job.

482
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,217
Yay!

483
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:20,653
And I think that my boss
already sexually harassed me.

484
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:23,239
But he saw the video
and he doesn't care!

485
00:19:23,241 --> 00:19:26,159
See that? Maybe Beercules
isn't so bad after all.

486
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,110
Yeah.

487
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:29,562
Hello?

488
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:32,081
Hey, Marshall,
my name is Pete Durkenson.

489
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,500
We went to Wesleyan together.

490
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:34,751
Yeah, no, I know.

491
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,953
Pete, we... we just
hung out yesterday.

492
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:39,172
All right, now Lily's message
makes a little more sense.

493
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:41,708
Listen, don't worry, bro,
I'm gonna take down the video.

494
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,926
You know what?

495
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,410
Leave it up.

496
00:19:44,412 --> 00:19:46,179
Whatever you say, Beercules.

497
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,050
Scalpel.

498
00:19:51,052 --> 00:19:53,269
You know what?
This is good.

499
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:55,688
I want our kid to see
every side of who I am.

500
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,940
Yeah.

501
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,424
Even the side that runs through

502
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,543
the East Village hangin' brain.

503
00:20:02,112 --> 00:20:03,480
I'm gonna call Pete back.

504
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:04,898
That's a good idea.

505
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,100
<i>That evening, I took</i>

00:20:09,788 --> 00:20:10,820
Mm. My pleasure.

Yeah, yeah.
Where's Lenny Kravitz?

511
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,276
Right there.

512
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:21,130
Leonard Kravitz,
world-renowned architect.

513
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,383
Guy's a rock star.

514
00:20:23,385 --> 00:20:25,001
He's gonna be
giving his famous

00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,386
90-minute lecture
on crossbeams.

516
00:20:26,388 --> 00:20:27,887
Well, great.

517
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:30,173
I'm gonna go find one
and hang myself from it.

518
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:31,591
Okay.
