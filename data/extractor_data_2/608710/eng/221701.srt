1
00:00:02,493 --> 00:00:05,644
I didn't get to where I am without
knowing how the world works, son.

2
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:06,802
I understand that, Arthur.

3
00:00:06,893 --> 00:00:11,887
And I'm used to getting what I want, so
why don't you just tell me what it'll take?

4
00:00:12,653 --> 00:00:13,688
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:13,773 --> 00:00:17,129
Don't prat about, son,
just give us the bottom line.

6
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,168
I'm afraid l...

7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:22,290
My theme park
is the biggest in the North of England...

8
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:24,603
most of it built with these hands.

9
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,968
In five years
we'll be the biggest in Europe.

10
00:00:27,053 --> 00:00:29,044
- Yes, but...
- No buts, son.

11
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:33,570
Just tell me what I have to give you
and Joe 90 here to win that tender.

12
00:00:34,373 --> 00:00:36,329
I'm afraid the tenders are all sealed.

13
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,802
Sealed, my ass. Harry.

14
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:49,924
There's £25,000 there.

15
00:00:50,693 --> 00:00:54,481
I won't be beat by some bloody Yank
dressed up as a mouse.

16
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:02,202
Well, this is most irregular.

17
00:01:02,493 --> 00:01:04,768
Are we doing business, or what?

18
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:15,169
Like I said, I usually get what I want.

19
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,885
Once the deadline has passed...

20
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:24,168
we can get working
on having it moved for you.

21
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:27,450
This will put us right up there
with the big boys.

22
00:01:30,213 --> 00:01:31,851
I'm sure it will.

23
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:29,764
All I'm saying is, you know,
if I was a bird, well, I'd shag me.

24
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:33,010
Can you hear yourself?

25
00:02:34,373 --> 00:02:36,568
I reckon she's gotta be a lesbian, ain't she?

26
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:38,086
Just because she knocked you back?

27
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:41,165
Listen, mate,
I don't get knocked back, okay?

28
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:45,883
Unless they're either
A: Lesbian, or B: Frigid.

29
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:48,089
- Or both.
- Exactly.

30
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:50,084
- Maybe she's got a boyfriend.
- So?

31
00:02:50,173 --> 00:02:51,686
Well, maybe she's happy with him.

32
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:54,765
Mate, happy, so what?
Why go for second best?

33
00:02:55,253 --> 00:02:57,289
Mick, straight off, okay?

34
00:02:57,373 --> 00:03:00,445
If you was a bird, would you shag me?

35
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:04,089
He's having a crisis of confidence.
The new receptionist blanked him.

36
00:03:04,173 --> 00:03:05,970
It's very simple. Yes or no?

37
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,288
No.

38
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:11,526
Well, that's because you'd be a lesbian.

39
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:15,127
Stacie, what's our working capital like?

40
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:16,891
Yeah, it's healthy. Why?

41
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,326
Albert's got a bite.

42
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,444
<i>Sir Anthony Reeves.</i>

43
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:30,402
<i>Until this morning, he was CEO</i>
<i>of one of the major utility companies.</i>

44
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:33,849
<i>Huge losses and under-investment</i>
<i>in infrastructure...</i>

45
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:36,766
<i>led to a rise in utility bills up to 39%..</i>

46
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:39,367
<i>and calls for his resignation.</i>

47
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:43,569
<i>His reward for</i>
<i>this inept piece of mismanagement...</i>

48
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:46,963
<i>was a golden handshake of £500,000.</i>

49
00:03:47,053 --> 00:03:49,567
<i>Sir Anthony borders on the xenophobic.</i>

50
00:03:49,653 --> 00:03:53,805
<i>Staunch defender of the pound,</i>
<i>hates anything European.</i>

51
00:03:53,893 --> 00:03:56,965
<i>He refers to anyone who earns</i>
<i>less than £100,000 a year...</i>

52
00:03:57,053 --> 00:03:58,850
<i>as "a member of the great unwashed."</i>

53
00:03:58,933 --> 00:03:59,968
<i>Nice man.</i>

54
00:04:00,053 --> 00:04:02,442
<i>Apartment in the city</i>
<i>and a rather nice country home...</i>

55
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,923
which he shares with his wife Janice
and two dogs.

56
00:04:06,293 --> 00:04:07,772
How did you find him, Albert?

57
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,572
We're both members
of the same gentleman's club.

58
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:14,692
We were on nodding terms until I learnt
recently about his new fortune.

59
00:04:14,773 --> 00:04:16,365
So you became firm friends?

60
00:04:16,453 --> 00:04:17,568
The best.

61
00:04:18,853 --> 00:04:22,892
<i>And he has two dirty little secrets</i>
<i>he hides from his wife.</i>

62
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,484
<i>A hankering for prostitutes.</i>

63
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:27,529
No, please.

64
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:29,524
Don't worry, my dear...

65
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:32,252
it's the second little vice
I think we should use.

66
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,368
Which is?

67
00:04:33,453 --> 00:04:35,523
I discovered it
when I borrowed his newspaper.

68
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,645
<i>He likes the gee-gees.</i>

69
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:44,965
<i>Better still,</i>
<i>his wife disapproves of gambling.</i>

70
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:56,444
Who's a naughty boy then?

71
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:07,244
- The wire.
- The wire?

72
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,528
Nobody's worked the wire in 100 years.

73
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:12,446
Last time I saw that was in <i>The Sting.</i>

74
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,086
It's an old-time scam, it's pre-1900.

75
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:20,324
Racing results used to go
from east to west...

76
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:22,404
by Western Union telegraph.

77
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:24,484
All you had to do was convince the mark...

78
00:05:24,573 --> 00:05:27,690
that you had someone on the inside
who could delay the results...

79
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:29,411
until you got the bet on.

80
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:30,687
Danny.

81
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:37,412
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Mickey.

82
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,411
Ash, can we make it work?

83
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,212
Yeah, but everyone watches races live
these days.

84
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,363
- Yeah, but not in person.
- No.

85
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,484
The principle still holds good, I suppose.

86
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:51,246
Just have to use video link
instead of telegraph.

87
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,368
Albert?

88
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,206
It's big.

89
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,126
So are we.

90
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:06,647
What can I get you?

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,610
- I'm looking for someone.
- Aren't we all?

92
00:06:08,693 --> 00:06:10,923
Danny Blue. You know him?

93
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:13,524
Sorry, mate, never heard of him.

94
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,963
On the off chance you meet him
in the next few days...

95
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:22,092
could you give him this for me?

96
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:31,763
Yeah, okay, if it said £<i>4</i>,
I say you gave us a tour of London.

97
00:06:31,853 --> 00:06:33,730
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah? Thank you.

98
00:06:33,813 --> 00:06:35,371
You've got a chip on your shoulder.

99
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:38,172
You should lose it,
or you'll always feel on the outside.

100
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:40,403
What's new?
I've been on the outside all my life.

101
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:42,723
In a good crew,
that will make you a liability.

102
00:06:42,813 --> 00:06:45,122
- I know that.
- Then deal with it.

103
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,004
Will you be lunching with us,
Mr. Winstone?

104
00:06:54,093 --> 00:06:57,290
No, thank you, my colleague and I
have some business to discuss.

105
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:59,329
- The library is free.
- Lovely.

106
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:02,405
How do you remember all your names?

107
00:07:02,493 --> 00:07:03,562
I don't need to.

108
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,611
In places like this,
it's their job to remember them.

109
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:37,571
This is a guaranteed winner, Uncle James.

110
00:07:37,653 --> 00:07:39,723
You have just got to take my word on it.

111
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:43,249
I'm sure you're right, dear boy,
but I'm afraid I don't gamble.

112
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,610
Anthony, I thought you'd be in hiding.

113
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:48,207
Nasty business.

114
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,204
That's the problem
with the great unwashed.

115
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:52,363
They hate to see
a fellow make a few pounds.

116
00:07:52,453 --> 00:07:55,889
I'm sorry, Anthony, this is Peter,
the son of a very old friend of mine.

117
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,406
- How do you do, sir?
- How do you do?

118
00:07:57,493 --> 00:07:59,643
Anthony's having a bit of trouble
with the press.

119
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,201
You're joking.
They are scumbags, aren't they?

120
00:08:02,293 --> 00:08:03,567
You've had dealings with them?

121
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:06,372
Not personally, sir.
My dad did, a few years back.

122
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,648
He was an activist
in the anti-Euro campaign.

123
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:10,485
- Press were all over him.
- Really?

124
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,087
Now, best forgotten, Peter.
Anthony, won't you join us?

125
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,845
Here, take my seat, sir, I'm just off.

126
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:16,332
No need on my account.

127
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,849
No, really, I only popped in here
to make Uncle James a few quid.

128
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:22,208
But as ever, he weren't interested.

129
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,807
Horses for courses, dear boy.

130
00:08:25,173 --> 00:08:27,403
Anyway, we'll talk later.
Nice to meet you, sir.

131
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:28,482
Goodbye, Uncle James.

132
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,006
Say hello to your mother for me.

133
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,924
I will, definitely. Bye-bye.

134
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:35,769
Black sheep of the family
through his teens...

135
00:08:35,853 --> 00:08:38,287
but has turned out
to be a rather nice young man.

136
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,170
He's in investments?

137
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,682
God, no. Horses.

138
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,364
- Horses?
- You know, the racing variety.

139
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:48,092
Had a "hot tip"
or whatever it is they call it.

140
00:08:49,013 --> 00:08:50,969
Did he mention the name?

141
00:08:51,813 --> 00:08:54,008
- Name?
- Of the horse.

142
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:57,204
Yes. It's...

143
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,482
No, it's gone.

144
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:04,088
But just as well, Anthony.
A fool and his money are soon parted.

145
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,048
Some coffee? Paul!

146
00:09:11,773 --> 00:09:13,491
- All right?
- Yeah.

147
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:16,491
What's a nice place like this
doing with a girl like you?

148
00:09:16,573 --> 00:09:18,529
- I take it it went well.
- Yeah.

149
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:22,367
You'd have been proud of me.
I was a real team player.

150
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,731
Your round, Danny.

151
00:09:30,093 --> 00:09:34,211
Hello. I was wondering if you could tell me
what won the last race?

152
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,052
Anywhere.

153
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,088
That's excellent. Thank you.

154
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:49,163
I heard you got blanked
by some bird at the hotel.

155
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:53,326
I did not get blanked, okay?
She's a lesbian.

156
00:09:53,413 --> 00:09:54,562
Right.

157
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,928
Had some bloke in here earlier,
looking for you.

158
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:00,362
What bloke?

159
00:10:00,453 --> 00:10:04,685
He didn't leave his name,
but he left his number here somewhere.

160
00:10:14,373 --> 00:10:16,762
It seems it's true, what you say.

161
00:10:17,253 --> 00:10:19,005
About a fool and his money.

162
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,928
There's a chap in here.

163
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:29,523
He was apparently conned into believing
he was buying the London Eye.

164
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:30,602
Really?

165
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:33,491
Apparently turned up to take possession.

166
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:36,610
- What was he thinking of?
- I can't imagine.

167
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,042
Thank you.

168
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:43,091
Problem is,
some people don't deserve money.

169
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,845
When chaps like us earn a few bob...

170
00:10:46,053 --> 00:10:47,725
they call us fat cats.

171
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:51,684
I mean, I don't moan when
one of the plebs wins the lottery, do I?

172
00:10:51,773 --> 00:10:53,764
I could hardly put it better myself.

173
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,731
Providing he doesn't move in next to me,
of course.

174
00:11:01,613 --> 00:11:03,171
Margo's Girl.

175
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:05,928
I'm sorry?

176
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:09,562
That horse you asked me about,
Margo's Girl, 1:00 p.m.

177
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,206
It just came back to me.

178
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:12,772
Where was it running, do you know?

179
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:14,684
I have no idea.

180
00:11:15,733 --> 00:11:17,007
I wonder if it won?

181
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,288
It's easy enough to find out.

182
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:22,809
Paul, there was a horse running today,
Margo's Girl.

183
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,805
Could you see how it did for me,
there's a good chap.

184
00:11:26,493 --> 00:11:29,246
- You'll be sick if it won.
- I never gamble.

185
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,642
There's nothing wrong
with an occasional flutter.

186
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,928
I don't know one end of the horse
from the other.

187
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,924
It's the sport of kings, old chap.

188
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:38,208
You haven't lived
till you've seen your horse...

189
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,204
running up that hill at Cheltenham.

190
00:11:40,293 --> 00:11:42,409
I'll have to take your word for it.

191
00:11:45,013 --> 00:11:47,004
Margo's Girl won, sir.

192
00:11:49,813 --> 00:11:51,724
- Price?
- 12-to-1.

193
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,332
Good Lord.

194
00:11:57,053 --> 00:12:01,808
This nephew of yours,
what does he do exactly?

195
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:05,249
Tell you the truth, I'm not sure.
Just something to do with horses.

196
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,688
I'd very much like to meet him again.

197
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:11,763
Well, I'm sure that can be arranged.

198
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:44,004
You must be Danny.

199
00:12:44,093 --> 00:12:47,085
- Wasn't sure you'd come.
- Well, I was curious.

200
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:52,042
Listen, mate, I ain't got all day,
so who are you and what do you want?

201
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:54,044
The name's Ray Fordham.

202
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,366
Are you as good
as they say you are, Danny?

203
00:13:00,493 --> 00:13:02,131
What are you then? Cop?

204
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,884
Do I look like a cop?

205
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,328
Well, they come in all shapes and sizes,
don't they?

206
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,244
I'm a grifter, just like you.

207
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:12,086
Are you?
How come I never heard of you then?

208
00:13:12,173 --> 00:13:14,607
You have. Scottish Ray?

209
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,287
You're Scottish Ray?
But you ain't even Scottish.

210
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:20,206
The name came from my first big con.

211
00:13:20,293 --> 00:13:22,966
I took a £50,000 down payment
on Edinburgh Castle.

212
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,089
Yeah, I've heard about that.

213
00:13:25,173 --> 00:13:28,051
'9<i>4</i>, weren't it?

214
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:29,851
'95.

215
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:32,851
I took another £20,000
for putting in double-glazing.

216
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,605
Don't you just love the Yanks?

217
00:13:34,693 --> 00:13:37,412
Yes, they've got romance in their soul.

218
00:13:37,613 --> 00:13:40,332
All right, I'm glad to meet you, Ray.

219
00:13:40,413 --> 00:13:41,732
Likewise.

220
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:43,731
So what can I do for you, mate?

221
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,326
I'm putting a new crew together.

222
00:13:45,413 --> 00:13:47,324
Yeah? Well, I know some people.

223
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,291
I don't want people, Danny. I want you.

224
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,405
Well, I think we've hooked him in enough
to give him a convincer.

225
00:13:57,493 --> 00:13:59,609
Ash, what about this place you've found?

226
00:13:59,693 --> 00:14:01,092
Well, it has to be a build.

227
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,403
Okay, but let's make it good. How long?

228
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,643
Couple of days, if I can get enough bodies.

229
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:07,166
Yeah, do it.

230
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:17,451
You should have been here
half an hour ago.

231
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:19,562
Sorry.

232
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:24,327
Right, Albert will set up the meet
with Danny for the day after tomorrow.

233
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,404
- You have to be ready by then.
- I will be.

234
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:30,372
Stacie, work out the costs with Ash,
then double up with Danny later on.

235
00:14:31,693 --> 00:14:33,012
Questions?

236
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,651
Okay, let's do it.

237
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:46,807
Problem?

238
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,127
No.

239
00:14:57,293 --> 00:15:00,842
A friend of mine down here tells me
you can find anyone.

240
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:04,050
If who you're looking for is in London,
I can find them.

241
00:15:04,293 --> 00:15:06,363
How much is that going to cost me?

242
00:15:06,653 --> 00:15:07,927
Depends who it is...

243
00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:10,129
and what you're going to do
when you find them.

244
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:13,011
Two con men, one black, one white.

245
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,532
I'm gonna kill them.

246
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:19,328
How's it going?

247
00:15:19,413 --> 00:15:22,689
Decoration's easy enough, but we
need to start getting the hardware in.

248
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:23,762
What's the setup?

249
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:25,764
Five or six furlong races are the best bet.

250
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:28,492
Means the race is over in a minute
to a minute-and-a-half.

251
00:15:28,573 --> 00:15:32,486
- Good. You've got everything you need?
- Yeah. You'll know when I haven't.

252
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:34,611
Steady with those.
Teddy wants them back.

253
00:16:09,373 --> 00:16:11,284
James, what a lovely surprise.

254
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:14,570
This is Peter,
and his young friend, Yvonne.

255
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:19,206
Come in, I'll fix you some drinks.
Anthony's in the lounge.

256
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:24,161
- James, welcome.
- Thank you.

257
00:16:25,093 --> 00:16:27,607
- Peter, nice to see you again.
- Sir.

258
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:32,009
And who is this vision of beauty?

259
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,691
This is Yvonne.

260
00:16:43,533 --> 00:16:46,127
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance,
my dear.

261
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,646
Sir Anthony.

262
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:51,521
Do you mind if I steal this young man?

263
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:53,212
Be my guest.

264
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,527
James tells me you're a betting man.

265
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,006
Not really, sir.

266
00:17:00,093 --> 00:17:03,847
Playing dumb?
Lets see if a few drinks will loosen you up.

267
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:08,165
That's what I like to see.

268
00:17:08,253 --> 00:17:11,051
A mark
who does all the hard work himself.

269
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:16,685
Okay. We get the TV feed in here
showing us the live race.

270
00:17:16,773 --> 00:17:19,128
Obviously we can't fix the races,
they're legit.

271
00:17:19,213 --> 00:17:22,444
But this little baby holds up the pictures
until the end of the race.

272
00:17:22,533 --> 00:17:24,649
When we've got a winner,
we'll give it to you.

273
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:26,485
You've got two minutes to put a bet on...

274
00:17:26,573 --> 00:17:28,484
before we start feeding it
through the front.

275
00:17:28,573 --> 00:17:31,406
As far as anyone is concerned,
they're watching the race live.

276
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:32,642
Two minutes isn't very long.

277
00:17:32,733 --> 00:17:36,089
You slow up the pictures any more,
our man might smell a rat.

278
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,086
It'll have to do.

279
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,483
Right. The main area is fully functioning.

280
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:42,882
I've tapped into a street light
for electricity...

281
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:44,804
re-routed mains water for the toilets.

282
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:46,804
As long as he doesn't kick the walls...

283
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:48,929
they should stay up long enough
for the job.

284
00:17:49,013 --> 00:17:50,241
It's a work of art.

285
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,006
Yeah. I've got 20 grifters coming in
as punters.

286
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,290
When they're here,
it will be the doggie's whatsits.

287
00:17:56,693 --> 00:17:59,366
- Okay, then we can start tomorrow.
- Yeah.

288
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:02,843
All I'm asking
is that you throw the odd tip my way.

289
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,525
It's more than my job's worth.

290
00:18:04,613 --> 00:18:05,762
You did it for James.

291
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:09,004
Yeah, but he's virtually family.
I mean, he'd do anything for me.

292
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:12,290
With all due respect, sir,
I hardly even know you, do I?

293
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,125
James will vouch for me.

294
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:15,686
Will he, now?

295
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,322
So what are you? A racing man, are you?

296
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:22,291
I think I'm what you'd call
an enthusiastic amateur.

297
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:28,842
Listen, what I'm about to tell you
mustn't go any further.

298
00:18:29,093 --> 00:18:30,765
You have my word.

299
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:33,723
I work for a syndicate.

300
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,492
We buy racehorses.

301
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,848
I knew it. You've got inside knowledge.

302
00:18:38,933 --> 00:18:40,252
It's slightly more than that.

303
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:45,123
Last year the company that I work for
teamed up with three other syndicates.

304
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:48,922
Then at Kempton last year,
we realized that between them...

305
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:52,649
they owned all the runners
in a single race.

306
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,768
Really?

307
00:18:53,853 --> 00:18:57,323
From there it's just a short step
to being able to determine...

308
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:00,291
which horses are going to win
certain races.

309
00:19:00,693 --> 00:19:01,842
You mean, fix them?

310
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,289
I'm not saying fix them. I'm just saying
they know who's going to win...

311
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,045
before they start.

312
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,363
And you can get the names
of the winning horses?

313
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:12,365
Me? No.
I'm much too far down the food chain.

314
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:14,921
But the horse you told James about.

315
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:18,008
Well, that came from Yvonne.

316
00:19:18,093 --> 00:19:19,492
Your girlfriend.

317
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:21,332
Can I be honest with you?

318
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,369
- Absolutely.
- Come here.

319
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:27,251
Listen, I'm trusting you completely here.

320
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:29,449
I hope Uncle James
ain't got you all wrong.

321
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,524
I can assure you he hasn't.

322
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,724
Now, the truth is...

323
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:37,044
Yvonne and me aren't really together.

324
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:41,931
She's a high-class escort.
Absolutely lovely.

325
00:19:42,133 --> 00:19:44,966
I mean,
I take her out every now and again.

326
00:19:45,173 --> 00:19:48,722
Last week, I gave her number to my boss.

327
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:52,567
She spends a bit of time with him.
She overhears him talking on the phone.

328
00:19:52,653 --> 00:19:55,042
Now the thing is,
he's got a bit of a crush on her.

329
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:57,249
So he wants to see her again.

330
00:19:57,493 --> 00:19:58,687
I don't blame him.

331
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:03,005
So, I gets to thinking
maybe I can find out a few more winners.

332
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,406
I went to Uncle James because, basically,
I ain't got the funds to finance it.

333
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:09,926
So you're looking for a backer?

334
00:20:10,013 --> 00:20:12,766
Well, we wouldn't be having
this conversation if I weren't.

335
00:20:12,853 --> 00:20:15,925
I mean, the most I could raise last time
was £1,000.

336
00:20:16,013 --> 00:20:18,732
- But you got £12,000 back.
- Well, yeah.

337
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,363
But what if I had £10,000?

338
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:30,604
Looks like we have a nibble.

339
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:44,007
I'm gonna have another crack at Frosty.

340
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:50,769
All right? Chatty as ever.

341
00:20:53,413 --> 00:20:54,892
See you.

342
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:01,285
Hey, that's quite a team.

343
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:05,612
Stacie Monroe, Albert Stroller,
"Three Socks" Morgan...

344
00:21:05,693 --> 00:21:08,207
and the great Mickey Bricks.

345
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,806
What are you doing here?

346
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,088
I just wondered
if you'd made your mind up yet.

347
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,845
We're in the middle of a score.

348
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,003
And what's your cut, Danny?

349
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:18,090
Who's calling the shots?

350
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:23,042
See, all you're doing is using your talent
to make Mickey Bricks look good.

351
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:25,609
Big up his reputation.

352
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:28,404
I'm learning off him.

353
00:21:28,653 --> 00:21:32,487
And as long as you're doing that,
he'll treat you like a kid.

354
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:34,411
Clock's ticking, Danny.

355
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:37,047
It ain't that easy. I owe them.

356
00:21:37,573 --> 00:21:40,929
Well, the choice is yours.
You know where I am.

357
00:21:43,173 --> 00:21:48,042
You're never gonna move up in class,
not until you break free.

358
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,327
All set?

359
00:22:15,413 --> 00:22:17,768
You're sure a bet of this size
will go unnoticed?

360
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,084
Listen, there's a private gambling club
the syndicate uses sometimes.

361
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,322
I'm a member there.

362
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,881
Strictly for high rollers.

363
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:27,407
It's all cash, no questions asked.

364
00:22:27,653 --> 00:22:31,043
I've seen people place bets
of up to £250,000 there.

365
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:33,044
No one even bats an eyelid.

366
00:22:33,133 --> 00:22:36,603
If we stick to one bet a day,
no one's gonna notice us.

367
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:40,769
I'm going to put in all my winnings
from last time.

368
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,811
All £12,000?

369
00:22:42,893 --> 00:22:46,010
Why not, when you know you can't lose?

370
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:54,961
Where to?

371
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:03,726
No worries.

372
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,485
Okay, guys. Car's pulled up.

373
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,206
Okay, everyone...

374
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:28,932
showtime.

375
00:23:31,733 --> 00:23:33,530
Stacie, out of sight.

376
00:23:44,133 --> 00:23:45,122
This is my card.

377
00:23:46,013 --> 00:23:47,969
You wouldn't even know
this place was here.

378
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,930
It's strictly members only.

379
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,402
It gets me away from the damn press.

380
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,168
We've got roulette and blackjack
through there.

381
00:23:55,253 --> 00:23:57,209
Can you believe it?
£20,000, beaten by a neck.

382
00:23:57,293 --> 00:23:59,568
Next time remind me to back a giraffe.

383
00:24:02,853 --> 00:24:04,605
This is the poker room.

384
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,052
- Peter.
- Mike.

385
00:24:09,453 --> 00:24:11,603
- How you doing?
- Hello. Long time no see.

386
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:13,046
Good seeing you. How you doing?

387
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:16,808
- This is my guest Anthony Reeves.
- It will be a pleasure to take your money.

388
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,043
Not today, Mike. We're feeling very lucky.

389
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,283
Yeah. You and everyone else in here.

390
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,092
That's Mike Taylor, the manager.

391
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,925
He seems very full of himself.

392
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,924
Yeah, but not for long, right?

393
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:31,611
Okay, Yvonne will call
as soon as she gets the horse.

394
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:34,526
It's going to be close to the start,
so you get your bet on...

395
00:24:34,613 --> 00:24:36,808
as soon as it comes through.

396
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,532
All right.

397
00:24:41,853 --> 00:24:43,491
There's my money.

398
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:58,322
Well?

399
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:02,130
The last two, the odds are too high.

400
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,052
Stacie?

401
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:07,250
If they win too much
it'll break us before we start.

402
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,210
Take 3-to-1 or less.

403
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:13,361
<i>And on the stands,</i>
<i>Flak Jacket coming through.</i>

404
00:25:13,453 --> 00:25:16,092
<i>Flak Jacket coming home alone</i>
<i>on the near side.</i>

405
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:19,370
<i>Flak Jacket gets up the wind</i>
<i>from Sober Jones, in third...</i>

406
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:20,852
Flak Jacket.

407
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:22,725
- Price?
- 2-to-1.

408
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:24,806
Okay, go.

409
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:33,167
- Hello.
<i>- Put it on Flak Jacket.</i>

410
00:25:33,253 --> 00:25:34,402
Right.

411
00:25:39,773 --> 00:25:41,809
£50,000. Dancing Ridge to win in the next.

412
00:25:41,893 --> 00:25:43,770
£50,000 to win. Thank you, sir.

413
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:54,087
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you.

414
00:25:55,653 --> 00:25:59,168
£2<i>4</i>,000 to win.
Flak Jacket in the next race.

415
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,642
£2<i>4</i>,000 to win. Thank you very much.

416
00:26:07,773 --> 00:26:10,048
Here we are, sir, thank you very much.

417
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:20,203
<i>They're ready. That's it.</i>
<i>And they're racing.</i>

418
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,408
They're off.

419
00:26:21,733 --> 00:26:23,769
Flak Jacket, 2-to-1.

420
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:25,452
Go on, son, come on.

421
00:26:26,213 --> 00:26:27,566
Just relax.

422
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,252
Come on, Flak Jacket.

423
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,766
Come on, son.

424
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:35,727
- Get your whip out, boy.
- He's coming.

425
00:26:37,373 --> 00:26:40,729
That's it! Go to the rail!

426
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:43,691
Come on, Flak Jacket!

427
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,408
Show them the way. Come on.

428
00:26:55,533 --> 00:26:58,491
Come on, my son! Yes!

429
00:26:59,853 --> 00:27:01,969
What did I tell you?

430
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,006
Beautiful.

431
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,568
You little beauty.

432
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,887
It hasn't been confirmed yet, sir.

433
00:27:27,653 --> 00:27:32,522
That's £<i>4</i>8,000, plus your stake.
That's £72,000 in all.

434
00:27:33,213 --> 00:27:36,125
£20,000, £30,000, £<i>4</i>0,000...

435
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:40,209
£50,000, £60,000, £70,000 and...

436
00:27:41,533 --> 00:27:43,763
£2,000. Here we are, sir.

437
00:27:46,093 --> 00:27:47,845
What's your maximum bet, mate?

438
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:50,811
- We have no maximum, sir.
- Thank you.

439
00:28:03,613 --> 00:28:04,648
Let's do it again.

440
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,883
No, one race a day. We agreed.

441
00:28:06,973 --> 00:28:10,409
- One more won't make any difference.
- We'll draw attention to ourselves.

442
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:12,131
Now let's just go, okay?

443
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:19,812
Flak Jacket.

444
00:28:20,613 --> 00:28:22,126
I can't believe it was that easy.

445
00:28:22,213 --> 00:28:25,125
You wouldn't believe what I had to do
to get that horse's name.

446
00:28:25,213 --> 00:28:26,646
I don't know.

447
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,127
Try me.

448
00:28:29,493 --> 00:28:32,246
Listen, the thing is,
if we want to make real money...

449
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:35,530
we need to put one big bet on
while Yvonne's still on the inside.

450
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,966
There's no rush, surely?

451
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:40,841
Well, what if he calls the agency
and asks for another girl?

452
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,647
He'd be mad.

453
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,293
No, Yvonne's right.
We don't want to take that risk.

454
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:47,807
And anyway, when all this is over...

455
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,930
you two lovebirds get to spend
the week together, don't you?

456
00:28:51,013 --> 00:28:53,481
- Just as promised, Tony.
- So we do.

457
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,047
So what do you think?

458
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,328
He wants one more smaller bet,
just to make sure.

459
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:02,643
- Wonderful!
- It wasn't Danny's fault.

460
00:29:02,733 --> 00:29:04,883
The pot is empty, we can't pay out.

461
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:08,124
Everything was geared to take him in
for the big one next time.

462
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:11,364
- He's this close.
- Close does not cut it, Danny.

463
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:14,844
It can't be helped.
We'll have to shut him out.

464
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:31,405
You know,
sometimes a desire for perfection...

465
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:33,723
can be misinterpreted as criticism.

466
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,929
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

467
00:29:37,893 --> 00:29:39,372
Why so grumpy?

468
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,046
I don't know.

469
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:44,326
Is it Rachel?

470
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:54,363
I had the decree nisi.

471
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,766
It's all over.

472
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,087
Why didn't you say?

473
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,289
How would that have helped?

474
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:06,531
Could have reminded you
that everyone here loves you.

475
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:17,083
Maybe after this one,
we should take a break for a while.

476
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:37,368
I think we should do £50,000.

477
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,405
Whatever you say.

478
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,242
Hello.

479
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:48,524
Put it on Mostarsil.

480
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:54,011
Run it now, before he gets to the window.

481
00:30:58,293 --> 00:31:01,968
Mostarsil in the next. £50,000 to win.

482
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,002
The race has started, sir.

483
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,043
- No, I said it before they started.
- I'm sorry, sir.

484
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:12,922
Problem?

485
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,608
- I was trying to place a bet.
- The race has started, sir.

486
00:31:19,893 --> 00:31:22,248
No more bets. Try the next race.

487
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:33,925
Come on, Mostarsil!

488
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:37,042
Christ!

489
00:31:39,053 --> 00:31:41,567
- 10-to-1, that's £500,000!
- I didn't get the bet on.

490
00:31:41,653 --> 00:31:44,292
- What?
- I didn't have time.

491
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,809
That's £500,000.

492
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,048
Shit!

493
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:30,887
No, wait. I want to see what they're doing.

494
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:38,928
Okay, so he's gone for the bait,
and we're all set for tomorrow.

495
00:32:39,013 --> 00:32:41,288
Stacie, Danny, go reel him in.

496
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:43,006
Any thoughts?

497
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:45,764
Think you've covered everything.

498
00:32:45,853 --> 00:32:47,650
Then go bring him in.

499
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,289
And no mistakes this time.

500
00:33:08,413 --> 00:33:11,291
I know, but I'm teaching him.

501
00:33:11,613 --> 00:33:13,444
You're smothering him.

502
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,891
Give him his head.

503
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,241
Maybe you'll see in him what I did.

504
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:22,564
What I saw in you once.

505
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:29,886
We've got a problem,
we're gonna have to meet up.

506
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,761
Yeah, okay. What about 6:30?

507
00:33:34,493 --> 00:33:36,688
All right. Thanks, Anthony.

508
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:44,361
This country's got stalking laws,
you know.

509
00:33:44,853 --> 00:33:47,367
Just thought I'd let you know
I'm heading back tomorrow.

510
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,489
I check out of the hotel at 3:00.

511
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:52,610
That's fine,
but I haven't made a decision yet.

512
00:33:53,053 --> 00:33:54,771
You'll be there.

513
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:01,682
What?

514
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:03,929
The syndicate's being investigated.

515
00:34:04,013 --> 00:34:06,607
- Why?
- I don't know, all right? It is.

516
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:08,604
Someone got wind of it. It's all off.

517
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:11,332
- It can't be.
- I'm telling you, it is.

518
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,406
They're gonna do one tomorrow,
then pulling the plug.

519
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,324
Wait. You said they're doing one more.

520
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,085
It's already set.

521
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:22,367
- Why can't we do it, too?
- Are you having a laugh?

522
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:25,889
The authorities will be
watching that race like hawks.

523
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:28,886
They'll be watching the syndicate, not us.

524
00:34:30,213 --> 00:34:32,283
I don't know. What do you think?

525
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:34,487
Risky.

526
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:40,887
He who dares and all that.

527
00:34:42,493 --> 00:34:44,563
Surely it's worth the risk?

528
00:34:48,013 --> 00:34:50,049
If we're gonna do this...

529
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:53,884
it has got to be a big bet.

530
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,081
Because I'm telling you,
this is the last chance.

531
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:58,572
Absolutely.

532
00:34:59,613 --> 00:35:02,810
The most I can raise
is probably going to be about £30,000.

533
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:07,052
You've got to be joking.
I'm not risking getting caught for that.

534
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:11,323
So how much would it take?

535
00:35:14,053 --> 00:35:15,566
£500,000.

536
00:35:17,853 --> 00:35:19,684
- What?
- £500,000.

537
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:23,402
Even if we only get 2-to-1 again,
we'd clear £1 million.

538
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,052
It's too rich for my blood I'm afraid.

539
00:35:30,813 --> 00:35:34,852
We could have a wonderful week
with £1 million in the bank.

540
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:37,565
I'm sorry, no.

541
00:35:40,053 --> 00:35:42,647
Well, if you're not up to it...

542
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:46,003
It's not a question of not being up to it...

543
00:35:46,093 --> 00:35:48,732
I just can't afford
to lose that kind of money.

544
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,565
How could you lose?

545
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:53,362
I mean, you've seen how it works.

546
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:56,047
Even so.

547
00:35:57,413 --> 00:35:58,926
£500,000.

548
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:06,131
<i>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</i>

549
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:10,563
<i>I mean, it's now or it's never.</i>

550
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:17,082
<i>Remember:</i>
<i>"A faint heart never won a fair maiden."</i>

551
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,848
Okay, I'm in.

552
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:37,642
Bank manager thought I was insane.
I had to threaten to close my account.

553
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:40,645
He'll calm down
when you pay double back in.

554
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:43,644
You're sure they'll take a bet this size?

555
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:45,564
You heard the man. No limit.

556
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:48,568
Gentlemen. Feeling lucky again?

557
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,291
I think we'll be okay.

558
00:36:51,373 --> 00:36:52,647
Think so?

559
00:36:53,813 --> 00:36:56,088
I do hope that's full of money.

560
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:02,568
We'll soon wipe that smile off his face.

561
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,245
Just ignore him.

562
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:09,526
Yvonne will phone the horse through,
and then she'll meet us here.

563
00:37:10,493 --> 00:37:12,290
I'll get us a drink.

564
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:26,813
- Anything?
- Favorite won the last.

565
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:29,771
- We've gotta try and get bigger odds.
- Wait.

566
00:37:29,853 --> 00:37:33,812
<i>... Kieren Fallon has gone two or three</i>
<i>in front of Roofer and Dennis El Menace...</i>

567
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:35,849
<i>battling on...</i>

568
00:37:42,773 --> 00:37:44,126
Got it.

569
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,411
Place it all on Roofer in the next race.

570
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:54,084
Yeah, I'll see you there.

571
00:38:00,053 --> 00:38:01,042
Roofer.

572
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:13,286
8-to-1. That's £<i>4</i> million!

573
00:38:14,093 --> 00:38:16,812
They're in the stalls. Get the bets on!

574
00:38:19,053 --> 00:38:21,567
<i>Last one to go on the inside.</i>

575
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:31,246
Here you go.

576
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,644
Roofer in the next race.

577
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:38,888
£500,000 pounds to win.

578
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,487
- Is there a problem?
- One moment, sir.

579
00:38:49,013 --> 00:38:50,287
What's wrong, Paul?

580
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,409
This gentleman wants to place
a large bet, sir.

581
00:38:52,493 --> 00:38:53,812
How large?

582
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,771
£500,000.

583
00:39:03,293 --> 00:39:05,409
- Price?
- Roofer. 8-to-1.

584
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,084
I understood there was no limit.

585
00:39:09,093 --> 00:39:11,812
- Take the gentleman's bet.
- I haven't got time to count it.

586
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:14,453
Take the case.
If the horse wins, we'll count it...

587
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:16,842
and pay out on whatever's there.

588
00:39:30,013 --> 00:39:31,571
Thank you, sir.

589
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:34,245
Thank you very much.

590
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:43,443
- That's it.
- Yes.

591
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:57,007
So, you get it on all right?

592
00:39:57,093 --> 00:39:59,368
Roofer, £500,000 to win.

593
00:40:00,293 --> 00:40:02,363
To win? I told you "place."

594
00:40:04,293 --> 00:40:06,853
- What?
- I said "place."

595
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:10,131
The syndicate went for a place
to throw everyone off the scent.

596
00:40:10,213 --> 00:40:13,569
That's what I told you.
I said, "Place it on Roofer."

597
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:15,723
That horse finishes third.

598
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:21,923
There's been a mistake.
I want my money back.

599
00:40:22,013 --> 00:40:24,811
- Sir?
- I meant to say "place," not "win."

600
00:40:24,893 --> 00:40:26,121
The race has started, sir.

601
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:27,771
I don't care, I want my money back!

602
00:40:27,853 --> 00:40:30,242
- House rules dictate that...
- Give me my money.

603
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,607
Come on, take it easy.

604
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:32,921
What the hell is going on?

605
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,971
You don't understand.
There's been a mistake.

606
00:40:38,693 --> 00:40:40,809
There was no mistake, sir.
Your horse just lost.

607
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:42,451
Get off me!

608
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:46,765
Aren't you Sir Anthony Reeves?
Boys, get some shots.

609
00:40:47,293 --> 00:40:50,012
This is what you're doing
with your golden handshake, sir?

610
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,606
Gambling with the taxpayers' money?

611
00:40:51,693 --> 00:40:53,524
I'm not betting, I don't gamble.

612
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:56,446
- Did this man place a bet with you, sir?
- That's confidential.

613
00:40:56,533 --> 00:41:00,162
Can you explain to our readers
why you're in a private gambling club, sir?

614
00:41:00,253 --> 00:41:02,403
I'm visiting a friend.

615
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,008
Do you think it's fair that the taxpayers
should fund your gambling habit?

616
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:09,051
Come on, sir, what have you got to say
to our readers?

617
00:41:20,373 --> 00:41:22,807
More important to the taxpayer, sir?

618
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:26,842
It's a nice car. Did you fund that
out of your winnings, sir?

619
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,532
There it is.

620
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:47,644
Well done, everyone.
All right, let's get out of here.

621
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:50,725
Wages in Eddie's Bar tomorrow night.
Let's go.

622
00:41:53,493 --> 00:41:55,927
- Well done, mate.
- All right, mate.

623
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:09,203
Now this is all over,
there's something I need to tell you.

624
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,487
The thing is...

625
00:42:19,293 --> 00:42:22,285
Look at you. Rats in a sewer.

626
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:28,482
Eyesight better? What was it? Laser?
I hear they're very good.

627
00:42:29,453 --> 00:42:31,205
What can we do for you, Arthur?

628
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:33,204
What can you do for me?

629
00:42:33,293 --> 00:42:35,932
You could try dropping to your knees,
kissing my feet...

630
00:42:36,013 --> 00:42:38,243
and begging me
not to paint the walls with you.

631
00:42:38,333 --> 00:42:41,450
But I'll settle for what you've just taken
off the last mug.

632
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:44,331
I'm sorry,
I don't know what you're talking about.

633
00:42:48,253 --> 00:42:50,164
You've got 10 seconds.

634
00:43:02,853 --> 00:43:04,889
Give him the money, Danny.

635
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:17,768
- Hold on a minute.
- Shut up.

636
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,168
No.

637
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,645
I'm sick of him telling me
when I can speak and when I can't.

638
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:31,611
- I'll handle this.
- Like you do with everything?

639
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:34,964
I'm sorry, Mickey,
but unless I've missed something here...

640
00:43:35,053 --> 00:43:38,966
you've just led us up shit creek
and forgot to pack the paddles.

641
00:43:39,053 --> 00:43:41,567
And that's what this is all about,
isn't it, Danny?

642
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:43,564
'Cause you think you could do better.

643
00:43:43,653 --> 00:43:47,441
Everything you've done since you got
out of nick has been down to me.

644
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:48,522
Down to you?

645
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:52,128
Except for the parrot impressions:
You do them yourself.

646
00:43:52,493 --> 00:43:54,165
You were a short con artist, Danny...

647
00:43:54,253 --> 00:43:56,972
working the clubs and bars for drinks
till I took you in.

648
00:43:57,053 --> 00:43:59,521
Yeah, you gave me a shot,
and I'm grateful for that...

649
00:43:59,613 --> 00:44:01,365
but I've been carrying you ever since.

650
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:05,048
No, the only thing you've been carrying
is an over-inflated ego.

651
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:08,967
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself, son.
You do have some qualities.

652
00:44:16,533 --> 00:44:17,932
Is that it?

653
00:44:23,573 --> 00:44:25,450
That's it, huh, Mick?

654
00:44:26,573 --> 00:44:28,928
The answer to all your problems.

655
00:44:29,613 --> 00:44:32,889
Things ain't going quite your way,
take a swing.

656
00:44:33,653 --> 00:44:34,972
Lash out.

657
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,091
You screwed up.

658
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:42,446
Now give the man his money back
and move on.

659
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,330
I was gonna do it when you started this.

660
00:44:44,413 --> 00:44:46,688
You were going to give him
the case of funny money.

661
00:44:46,773 --> 00:44:47,922
It's what he asked for.

662
00:44:48,013 --> 00:44:51,289
And how long would it take him
to realize this cash is crap...

663
00:44:51,373 --> 00:44:52,852
come back here and kill us?

664
00:44:52,933 --> 00:44:56,812
Well done. Brilliant. He didn't know
it was fake until you just told him, genius.

665
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:59,009
You don't think he's gonna find out?

666
00:44:59,093 --> 00:45:03,769
This stuff, mate,
wouldn't pass in a corner shop!

667
00:45:03,853 --> 00:45:05,605
So what would you do?
Give him our money?

668
00:45:05,693 --> 00:45:08,685
If it's a straight choice
between that and death? Yes!

669
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:09,888
That would clean us out.

670
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:12,487
Mickey, he's holding a shotgun!

671
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:14,291
We'd have nothing!

672
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,412
Fine. If you wanna get killed, for what...

673
00:45:21,813 --> 00:45:25,726
£60,000, £70,000, go ahead.

674
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,646
Do it, Mick.

675
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:42,921
For once in your life, do the right thing.

676
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,210
What happened to you?

677
00:46:00,653 --> 00:46:02,689
What's in the drawer, Ash?

678
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:05,486
Like you said, £60,000, £70,000, tops.

679
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:08,612
Pay the man.

680
00:46:10,613 --> 00:46:13,411
I suggest you do
what the young man says.

681
00:46:15,173 --> 00:46:18,722
And make sure there's
none of that funny money in there.

682
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:33,165
I'm sorry, Mick.

683
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:42,051
£50,000 profit in four days, not bad.

684
00:46:42,693 --> 00:46:46,652
Like I told you boys,
I usually get what I want.

685
00:47:03,933 --> 00:47:05,525
Did you feel it?

686
00:47:12,773 --> 00:47:14,092
Amazing.

687
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:17,209
- I'm dripping...
- I'm sorry.

688
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,045
Taking your revenge.

689
00:47:24,733 --> 00:47:27,850
All right, come on, everybody,
let's get out of here now!

690
00:47:40,613 --> 00:47:42,843
Did you have a good day, dear?

691
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:53,044
Conmen, my ass. They thought
they were dealing with a bloody idiot.

692
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:56,921
Some country boy from up north,
still wet behind the ears.

693
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:59,807
They won't make that mistake again.

694
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:03,806
Take more than a bunch of
Southern Jessies to get the better of me.

695
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:20,250
You all right, boss?

696
00:48:51,093 --> 00:48:53,653
Right. Just wait a second.

697
00:48:57,413 --> 00:48:58,448
Wait.

698
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:01,093
I'm going now,
so I won't be pestering you anymore.

699
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:05,644
Okay, that's it. So I guess
what I really wanted to know is...

700
00:49:08,253 --> 00:49:10,767
why you wouldn't go out with me.

701
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:19,530
'Cause you're a lesbian. Yes!
There's nothing wrong with that.

702
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:24,452
I bloody knew it.

703
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:26,643
- No.
- Yes. Absolutely, yeah.

704
00:49:31,733 --> 00:49:34,645
- Danny, you wanted to talk to me.
- When?

705
00:49:34,733 --> 00:49:37,850
Before Arthur came in you said
there was something you had to say.

706
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,606
Oh, that. It was nothing.

707
00:49:41,093 --> 00:49:43,732
- Sure?
- Positive.

708
00:49:44,053 --> 00:49:48,410
Only I thought you were going to tell me
you were joining Scottish Ray's new crew.

709
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:53,851
- You knew that?
- I know everything.

710
00:49:53,933 --> 00:49:56,766
- Are you two still squabbling?
- Time to go.

711
00:50:00,613 --> 00:50:03,173
- We'll be gone for a while.
- Have a well-earned rest.

712
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,721
- But we know what you're thinking.
- Gap in the market.

713
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:08,373
- Think you might try your luck?
- Easy when you know how.

714
00:50:08,453 --> 00:50:09,602
But if you do...

715
00:50:09,693 --> 00:50:12,526
You gotta remember
the first rule of the con.

716
00:50:12,613 --> 00:50:14,490
You can't cheat an honest man.

717
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:16,052
- Can't happen.
- Impossible.

718
00:50:16,133 --> 00:50:18,089
Find someone who wants something
for nothing.

719
00:50:18,173 --> 00:50:19,447
Which shouldn't be hard.

720
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:22,286
And then give them nothing
for something.

721
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,651
Thank you, Captain.

722
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,928
You know, I've been thinking.

723
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:44,723
I'm not getting any younger.

724
00:50:45,613 --> 00:50:48,491
Maybe I should retire. Bow out gracefully.

725
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:50,564
- You're serious?
- Absolutely.

726
00:50:50,653 --> 00:50:53,963
- It'd be a crying shame, Albert.
- You'll find someone else.

727
00:50:54,053 --> 00:50:55,884
There's no one quite like you, Albert.

728
00:50:55,973 --> 00:50:59,010
Albert, it's your choice.
Whatever you decide.

729
00:50:59,853 --> 00:51:00,888
Thank you, Michael.

730
00:51:00,973 --> 00:51:03,441
...so I said to this guy, "You're crazy.

731
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:05,683
"My old man leaves me $3 million...

732
00:51:05,773 --> 00:51:08,048
"and I'm going to invest in molasses?"

733
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:12,281
I told him.
I said, "I don't know nothing about shoes."

734
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:17,091
Do you want me to hold your drink
for you, Albie?

735
00:52:11,053 --> 00:52:12,088
English
