1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,630
He loves these intimate spaces.

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,760
It's where he tries out
all his new stuff.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,950
Le Jean's a genius.
He's bringing them all to a climax.

4
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,830
Holding off hitting that sweet
spot as long as possible.

5
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,080
They all worship him.

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,750
You were awesome, babe. Bless ya,
babes, bless ya, but, nah...

7
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,950
No, you smashed it.
It wasn't tight, you know what I mean?

8
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,510
It was. It was absolutely...

9
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,430
I was dropping beats all
over the place, man.

10
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,600
No, it was amazing, baby.
I didn't feel it, it was like...

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,870
- Yo. You the guy buying up all the
clubs, right? - Gary Harbinger.

12
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,110
Gary is the owner of the
Shimmers chain.

13
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,470
Nice, man, nice. And you
remember Kelly Sumner?

14
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,969
He's been overseeing
the legal side.

15
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,550
My granddaughters are
your biggest fans.

16
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,670
They download all your records.

17
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,290
Safe, man, safe.
What about somedrinks, yeah?

18
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,689
Good idea, good idea.
Yo, Darryl!

19
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,650
Get these guys some, I don't know,
Jagermeisters or something like that.

20
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,249
We're making history tonight.

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,310
Just to let you know your car's here
to take you to the helipad, OK?

22
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,830
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Guys,
we have to wrap this up quick.

23
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,630
Are you going somewhere? Am I going
some... What, is this guy for real?

24
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,870
Le Jean plays a set at Pacha on Ibiza
every Tuesday.

25
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,270
- It's a legendary night.
- Everybody knows that, don't they?

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,430
You want to attach my
name to your clubs

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,550
and you don't know about
my Pacha set?

28
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,270
Well, Marcus here handles the acts
and the day-to-day business...

29
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:12,190
Whoa, whoa.
See, haul up, haul up.

30
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,430
See...

31
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,910
Are you...

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,470
Are you saying that
what I do is an act?

33
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,670
Like, what, like I'm some
kind of mobile disco pig,

34
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:25,369
available for weddings
and Bar Mitzvahs?

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,880
Easy, big fella, easy.

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,730
Do you know who I am?

37
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:33,529
Of course he does, Garry,
of course he does,

38
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,430
he's just, er, he's very
protective of his image, yeah?

39
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,110
It's a credibility issue.

40
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,430
Yeah, it's a credibility issue,
it's all about mystique as well.

41
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,710
Did you see the people down there?
Did you see them?

42
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,790
They don't come to one of my gigs
cos they want to listen to music, man.

43
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,750
It's a pilgrimage, dread.

44
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,390
And because I got that credibility,
those people out there

45
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,510
are my disciples, they worship
at the decks of Le Jean.

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,400
And that is what sells.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,080
Do you feel me?

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,870
I feel you.

49
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,830
All right, look, I done schooling
you, right? Peace and love.

50
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,600
Let's get down to business, yeah?

51
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
One hundred grand in fifties,
as you requested.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,720
It's red. It's my colour.

53
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,700
Gentlemen, enjoy the drinks.
Enjoy the company. Laters, yeah?

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,030
We should have stayed a bit longer.

55
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,729
What, anything to do with
the nearly naked girls?

56
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,870
We only booked
them for an hour,

57
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:50,769
someone should make
sure they get home safely.

58
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,080
The kid's all heart.
Thanks. Drinks are on us.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
- You Fisk?
- No, I'm the Easter Bunny.

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,430
You got something for me, or not?

61
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,550
My employer would look very
favourably on the individual

62
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,470
that put this guy out of business...

63
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,280
permanently.

64
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,630
Can you do it?
- Won't be easy.

65
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,080
The five grand's a down payment.
There's another 15 when it's done.

66
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,380
sync and corrections by Bellows
www.addic7ed.com

67
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,590
Cor, what's that pong?

68
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,750
It smells like dead, wet dog
in here. Edward.

69
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,350
Hold your horses.
I'm nearly there.

70
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,230
Oh, look, more bags. What, it's not
rancid enough in here?

71
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,910
You sure you got
enough rubbish, Ed?

72
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,390
- It piles up, Sean. You'd be amazed.
- Surely this is a health hazard?

73
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,670
Yes, you'd think so, wouldn't you?

74
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,510
Erm, do you maybe want to explain
what's going on, Edward?

75
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,670
It's a bloody outrage. That's what's
going on. It's a bloody scandal.

76
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,750
The council has started
fining you 200 quid

77
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,849
for leaving your rubbish
out over night.

78
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,470
- Eh? - See, they pick it up between
eight and nine on a Tuesday morning.

79
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,870
Before, you could leave your
bags out on a Monday night.

80
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,230
Now, some jobsworth environmental
officer comes round

81
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,310
and tells me I've got to put them
out just before they get here.

82
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,870
- What do I pay me rates for?
- Well, take it out the back, then.

83
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,890
There's no access.
Now I've got to schlep it

84
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,489
through the bar
where there's customers.

85
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,990
Then this same inspector
comes round

86
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,310
and tells me I can't take the rubbish
through the bar during opening hours.

87
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,750
So you can't leave them out overnight
or bring them through in the morning?

88
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,010
You're a bit stuffed then, ain't ya?

89
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:47,409
- Exactly. It's a thingy-o
- It's a paradox? - No.

90
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,849
- No, a catch-22? - No
- Chinese puzzle? - No.

91
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,030
- A conundrum?
- No.

92
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,990
- A mystery within a puzzle wrapped up
in an enigma? - Tell you what it is.

93
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,090
It's a downright flamin'
liberty, that's what it is.

94
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:02,110
- Ooh, I can feel a rant coming on.
- Into the office then.

95
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,430
Ed, when you've finished moaning,
can I have a full English?

96
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:06,729
Do you lot ever listen
to a word I say?

97
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,550
Yeah, of course we do. Bags,
bleedin' councils, rates, by-laws,

98
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,830
flamin' liberties, eggs over easy,
chunky toast,

99
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:14,929
mug of tea, and three sugars.

100
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,190
OK, everyone.
Listen up.

101
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,510
Michael Stone, aka Mickey Bricks.

102
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,390
As some of you'll know,
Stone and his crew

103
00:07:21,489 --> 00:07:23,689
have been giving the fraud
squad the run-around for years.

104
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,010
I've had a whisper that their
next big scoop is on our patch.

105
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:26,809
I'm not having it.

106
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,390
I want them shut down.

107
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,470
Are fraud all right with this, guv?
I'll talk them through it

108
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,270
when Stone and his crew are locked up.
I want round-the-clock surveillance.

109
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,410
Albert Stroller. The Roper.
Been grifting since the Boer War.

110
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:39,609
He's got contacts all over the city.

111
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,950
Ash "Three Socks" Morgan.
The Fixer.

112
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:43,249
He knows more tricks
than a cartful of monkeys.

113
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,730
But this is where we start.
Sean and Emma Kennedy.

114
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,729
The newbies.

115
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,390
Stroller found them making
short cons on the street

116
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:51,489
and brought them into
the fold.

117
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,810
He and Stone are training them up,

118
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,209
moulding them into
their own seedy image.

119
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,950
These two are Stone's 
soft underbelly.

120
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:58,949
If we get to them, we can
penetrate the inner circle,

121
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,830
tear it apart.
That's how we get him.

122
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,850
Read the file, get to know
them, how they operate.

123
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,249
Let's show the third
floor how it's done.

124
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,480
All right, come on,
you heard the man.

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,630
- Ma'am. Didn't see you there.
- Who assigned you to this case?

126
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,870
My brief is to catch criminals
and hit my crime target figures.

127
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,530
I wasn't aware that I had to
have every case authorised

128
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:21,929
before I launch an investigation.

129
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,710
And does the fraud squad know
you're going after Stone?

130
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,550
The information I've been given
is that they're planning a job,

131
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,950
I can't to this stage determine
whether it's fraud or not.

132
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:32,049
Don't play games with me, lnspector.

133
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,030
I'm just an old-fashioned copper.
Find the bad guys. Put 'em away.

134
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,670
Some of us have to get
our hands dirty.

135
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,000
And that's how you intend to conduct
the case, is it? Get dirty?

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,190
If I have to.

137
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,390
I will not have this department
brought into disrepute.

138
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,310
Everything gets done by the
book, the same book I'll be

139
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,670
throwing at you if I find out
you've been cutting corners.

140
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,390
Yes, Ma'am.

141
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,070
I mean it, lnspector.

142
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,750
You have to catch him
with the cash in his hand.

143
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,910
Any room for doubt and you'll end up
embarrassing us all.

144
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh, I'll catch him, Ma'am.
I guarantee it.

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,830
OK, so our new mark is
Linda Runcorn.

146
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,670
The story is that she's the CEO of
an online restaurant and hotel guide.

147
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,470
It's got a huge tourist readership,
so it's very influential.

148
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,070
However, excellence is not the best
way to guarantee a good review.

149
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,549
The larger chains escape, but
she tells the smaller hotels

150
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,049
and family restaurants that if they
don't make it worth her while,

151
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,049
she'll put them out of
business.

152
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,510
- Worth her while by handing
over cash? - Precisely.

153
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,110
The smaller hotels and restaurants
survive on reputation.

154
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:42,150
She operates on fear, and once she's
got hold of you, she bleeds you dry.

155
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,190
Character traits? A bully.
She sucks up to the bigger chains,

156
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,030
while bullying the smaller clients
who can't afford to fight back. Nasty.

157
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,710
- What's our way in?
- Her mum's family, the Toppings.

158
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,230
Had a bit of land and a noble
line going back centuries,

159
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,190
but they cut off her grandmother,
Helen Topping, without a penny

160
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,990
when she married a builder.

161
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,990
Seems the family thought
he was beneath her.

162
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,070
But to this day, Linda wears
a bracelet given to her

163
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,430
by her Grandmother which bears
the Topping family crest.

164
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,150
So what's the game?
An inheritance scam?

165
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,270
Yeah. We use a long-lost relative
Linda's never heard of.

166
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,670
One of the Toppings. A maiden aunt
who died without making a will,

167
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,510
leaving behind an estate which
Linda is the sole heir to.

168
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,360
Which just happens to be worth
a small fortune. Exactly.

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Yeah, I'm here.
I'll call you when I'm done.

170
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,030
- Miss Runcorn?
- Yes.

171
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,750
Hello. I'm Holly Patterson,
Greyshot Genealogy.

172
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,870
I was rather surprised
to get your letter.

173
00:10:50,871 --> 00:10:53,569
- Oh?
- How did you find me?

174
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,310
- The voting register.
- Did I ask for water?

175
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,290
For heaven's sake, just put it down.
We'll call you when we want something.

176
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,150
They fuss all over you, then when
you actually want something,

177
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,750
when you want to actually
order something,

178
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,849
they're nowhere to be bloody seen.
Quite.

179
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,590
So, what's this potentially
exciting news exactly?

180
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:13,990
Well, every few months,
the Treasury releases

181
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:16,289
a list of estates that are intestate.

182
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,230
- That means... - People who died
without leaving a will. Yes. Yes.

183
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,830
You're one of those bloody
heir hunters, aren't you?

184
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,910
Oh, well, we prefer
probate investigators.

185
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,230
All the same thing,
like ambulance chasers.

186
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,190
I can't imagine what you
found on my father's side,

187
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,689
they didn't have two
pennies to rub together.

188
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,030
What is it?
A tin bath?

189
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,670
Well, actually, it's a relative
on your mother's side.

190
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,990
- Oh. My mother's side?
- Yes, the Toppings...

191
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:45,430
Now, this is your great-aunt Irene.
Irene Topping. Excuse me.

192
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,950
Sorry, I just need to check this.

193
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,350
She's the sister of your
maternal grandmother.

194
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,870
Now, your great-aunt passed away.

195
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:57,790
She was childless, she never married
and she didn't leave a will.

196
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,950
So her estate passed to
the next in line.

197
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,150
- Which is you. -Me?
- Yes. It appears so.

198
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,230
Well, I don't suppose there's
anything to get too excited about.

199
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,170
I never really believed
all those rumours

200
00:12:10,171 --> 00:12:12,369
about my mother's
aristocratic family.

201
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,190
The old bag probably left me a
tatty old armchair and some cats.

202
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,010
Well, she actually left you
jewellery and property

203
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:24,209
worth in the region of £4.7 million.

204
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:28,190
And, as far as we can tell,
you are the sole heir.

205
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:32,150
Well, that's different.

206
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,310
I mean, obviously, I am devastated
about poor old Great-Aunt Irene.

207
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,390
But... Sorry,
did you say 4.7 million?

208
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,430
- I did.
- O-M-G.

209
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,750
Well, it was a 
pleasure to meet you.

210
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,040
You'll be hearing from us soon.
Bye-bye.

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,350
Yeah, it's me. Done.

212
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,080
- Hook, line and sinker.
- OK, good. See you back here.

213
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,310
Well?

214
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,470
Some old rubbish about an old
aunt leaving her a fortune.

215
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,800
All right, stay on it.

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,320
Katherine Farmer.

217
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,390
We haven't seen you for a while.

218
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,670
Still picking pockets?

219
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,390
No idea what you're
banging on about, mate.

220
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,670
Really?

221
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,440
You going to tell me what I'm doing
here, or what? You know this man?

222
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,790
Don't ring any bells. Sean Kennedy.
Never seen him before.

223
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,960
Really? Let me jog your memory.

224
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,990
We found this with your stuff.

225
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,790
That ain't mine.
Intent to supply Class-As.

226
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,120
You can't stitch me up like that.
Can't I? I want to see a brief.

227
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,550
This isn't your first
offence, is it, sweetheart?

228
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,249
It's not going to be three
months, out in a fortnight.

229
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,870
You'll do serious time for this.
Now look at the picture again.

230
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,190
Sean Kennedy.

231
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,270
All right.
I may have seen him knocking about.

232
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,910
It was more than that, wasn't it?

233
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,350
Used to run around together,
get into scrapes.

234
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,150
We was just kids.

235
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,870
I don't see him any more.

236
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,590
What happened?
His sister put a stop to it?

237
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,150
Didn't want a nasty little pilferer

238
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,270
like you horning in on their double
act? It weren't like that. Whatever.

239
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,550
I think it's time you and
Sean got reacquainted.

240
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,110
Why? I'm going fishing,
and you're my bait.

241
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,670
Do I look like a maggot? You'll
infiltrate this gang he's joined

242
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,840
and report back to me.
No. I ain't no grass.

243
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,760
I see you've had a little girl.

244
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,320
What is she now?
Two?

245
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,190
Be a shame. Drug-dealing mum
locked up, kid put into care...

246
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,470
You leave her out of this.

247
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,170
She's be a teenager
when you got out.

248
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,769
Wouldn't even know you.
She'd be with a new mum.

249
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,950
- You can't do this.
- I'm a police officer, sweetheart,

250
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,030
I can pretty much do anything I want.
Now, you do what I'm telling you,

251
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,920
or your brat will be in a foster
home in time for her tea.

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,270
What's this here, a family crest?

253
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,710
The Topping family.
We need an exact match.

254
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,110
By tomorrow, you said?

255
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,310
- Can it be done? - It's not easy.
You have to get the stone right.

256
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,630
The shape and the clarity, and the
way the light dances off the...

257
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,310
- Hmm. That's odd.
- Something wrong?

258
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,830
Not at all, but you might
want to rethink a replica.

259
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,230
- Why? - Because if
this is what I think it is,

260
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,470
a replica won't stand up to any
serious scrutiny.

261
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,310
It's fine with the naked eye, but if
she gets it authenticated...

262
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,360
What?

263
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,510
- What is it, Bob?
- Cushion-cut, 20-carat, azure stone.

264
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,830
If I'm not mistaken,

265
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,070
we are looking at a
150-year-old Kashmir sapphire.

266
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,390
Well, that sounds expensive.

267
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,500
It's hard to tell from a snap,

268
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,599
but if this is the real thing,
it could be 20-30 grand.

269
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,490
It won't stand up to close scrutiny,

270
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,289
but I'll get you the replica
by tomorrow, all right?

271
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,380
Cheers.

272
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,110
Bloody hell. You spilled my shampoo,
you clumsy....

273
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:34,350
Oh, I'm so sorry. Watch the suit,
will you? It's a nice one, then?

274
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,518
I said get your grubby
mitts off my threads.

275
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,649
Now tootle off back to your caravan.
There's a dear.

276
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,140
Get me another bottle.

277
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,670
She's stolen my wallet.
Stop that girl.

278
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,750
Police. What you talking about?
I ain't done nothing.

279
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,430
Hey. What's going on here?
City of London Police.

280
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,910
- What seems to be the problem?
- This geezer is sexually harassing me.

281
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,070
I wouldn't touch you with
a jack hammer, love.

282
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,030
Both of you calm down. Sir, why don't
you explain to me what's happened?

283
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,110
This grotty little chav
stole my wallet.

284
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,930
Do you want a smack, 
cheese breath?

285
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:05,929
I want her to turn out
her pockets right now.

286
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:06,870
I want my money back.

287
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,480
And I want you to calm down.
I'm not going to warn you again, sir.

288
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,040
Do as he says.
Empty your pockets.

289
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,030
- It's not there.
- Well, are you sure it's missing, sir?

290
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,740
Yes. I keep it inside my jacket.

291
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:25,499
Why don't you check
your other pockets?

292
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,499
I don't see why, I don't keep...

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,630
I think you owe this young lady
an apology, don't you?

294
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,360
- I'm sure she...
- Oh, come on, then, apologise.

295
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,800
Sir.

296
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,560
- I'm most terribly sorry.
- Yeah, well, up yours, creep.

297
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,150
No, seriously, did you
see that guy's face?

298
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,510
When I accused him of
sexually harassing me,

299
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:55,809
I thought he was going to puke.

300
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,030
What happened to you? Kat Farmer
used to be the best in the business.

301
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,030
Used to be able to
steal anything, and you

302
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,729
got caught nicking a wallet.
Come on, girl!

303
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:05,030
Who says I wanted his wallet?

304
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,440
Whoa, nice.

305
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,990
Shit.

306
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,830
- You know, I never thought
I'd see you again. - Why's that?

307
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,110
You're in this fancy new crew now.
I'm still nicking watches.

308
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,070
I might have moved on,
but I haven't changed.

309
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,830
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

310
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,870
Yeah, well, I ain't a grass.
I know.

311
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,470
I was worried about you in there.

312
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,590
It weren't that bad. Regular meals
every day. A roof over my head.

313
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,150
It's good that you
were worried though.

314
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,070
You ain't done so bad for yourself,
have you? Well, you know...

315
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,870
I got a little girl now.

316
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,110
What?

317
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,350
Yeah, she'll be three next month.

318
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,190
I can't believe you're a mum.

319
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,950
Dad's a bit of a waste of space
though, I ain't seen him in two years.

320
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,110
I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be.
Like I said, he's a waste of space.

321
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,710
Look, Sean, now you're all sorted,
I could really use a leg up.

322
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,790
Uh?

323
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,990
There must be some little job I can
do in that fancy crew of yours?

324
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,470
Sweep up? Make the tea?

325
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,750
Stand there and look pretty?

326
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,230
Kat, it's not really that...

327
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,690
I'll get Mum to look
after Laurel for a bit.

328
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,489
Truth is, Sean, I'm really skint.

329
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:17,190
Oh. No. I don't want your charity,
you know me better than that.

330
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,560
I want to work for it.

331
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,510
Ash sent these over
from the printers.

332
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,029
These are fake title deeds to a
30-acre pile in Northumberland.

333
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,929
Great.

334
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,140
And documents showing all the debts
still owed to the estate.

335
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:41,079
Fantastic.
Hey, guys.

336
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,670
- Sean, what the hell are you...?
- I see you've brought company.

337
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,550
All right?
I'm Kat.

338
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,700
Like your gaff.
This all from grifting then?

339
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,990
- All right, Emms?
Long time no see. - Kat.

340
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,270
- Wow. Look at you, all glammed up.
- Look, she's an old friend, OK?

341
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,030
I said she could help out with a job.

342
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,790
She used to hang around with me
and Emma back in the day.

343
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,430
She just needs a leg up, that's all.

344
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,030
It's one job, and I'll
pay her from my share.

345
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,950
Are you serious? I mean, I'm sorry,
this is nothing personal...

346
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,910
I can vouch for her 
and so can Emma.

347
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,470
That aside, I owe her.
She kept me from going to prison.

348
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,520
- That was a long time ago, Sean.
- That's what I said.

349
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,230
It makes no difference.

350
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,710
I was 15, and she could
have seriously reduced

351
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:32,209
her sentence if she'd grassed
me up, but she didn't.

352
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,350
You two, of all people,
should respect that.

353
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,260
How many of your old
friends have turned up?

354
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,919
And we've taken care of
every single one of them.

355
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,790
Kid's got a point.

356
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,000
- Emma?
- Oh, she's a train crash.

357
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,400
But she's all right.

358
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,190
OK.
We'll work her into the con.

359
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:05,830
- Looks like she's in, Guv.
- All right. Stay on it.

360
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,030
OK. So tomorrow, Emma
goes to see Linda

361
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:11,429
and reveals the news about
the debts owed on the estate.

362
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,630
But before she starts asking
questions, show her the bracelet.

363
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,870
Yeah, there might be
an issue with that.

364
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,110
An issue?

365
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,049
Seedy Bob says the sapphire
on the bracelet might be

366
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,230
a rare Kashmir sapphire,
and very hard for Bob to forge.

367
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,640
- So if she gets it authenticated...
- Yeah. They'll spot it.

368
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,090
What if we do a switch?

369
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:36,089
What, swap Linda's bracelet
for Seedy Bob's replica?

370
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,710
Yeah. So she gets her own
bracelet authenticated.

371
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,870
What if she compares the two?

372
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,510
No, no, apparently, the replica will
look the same to the naked eye.

373
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,150
It's only if she gets it examined
that there's a problem.

374
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,830
Even if that's true, it's
still a tricky manoeuvre.

375
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,320
Not for Kat. She could easily swap
the fake bracelet for the real one.

376
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:58,190
Seriously, guys. It makes perfect
sense. It's what she specialises in.

377
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,670
She could do that switch with her
hands tied behind her back.

378
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,710
Well, it is what I do. Kat can go
along as Emma's assistant,

379
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,240
Emma can distract Linda and
Kat can move in for the kill.

380
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,320
It makes sense.

381
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,470
Lovely morning.
It was.

382
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,510
And there was me thinking this was the
beginning of a beautiful friendship.

383
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,870
Yeah, well, think again.

384
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,790
So what have you got for me?

385
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:35,350
They're conning some bird.

386
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,130
Linda Runcorn.
An inheritance scam, I know all that.

387
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:38,229
Tell me something I don't know.

388
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,470
They've got this fake bracelet that
proves it's legit, or something...

389
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,830
Except there's a snag.

390
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,510
They think that the sapphire in
the bracelet might be from Kashmir.

391
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,950
Could be worth a few quid.
Maybe more than a few quid.

392
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,910
So they're worried this Linda
might get it valued?

393
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,630
Yeah. They want me to
help Emma do the switch.

394
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,310
I nick the real one and put
the fake one back on her wrist.

395
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,270
So, Runcorn gets her own valued,
thinks the whole thing's kosher.

396
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,210
All right.
Do what they want for now.

397
00:23:04,211 --> 00:23:06,009
Keep reporting back to me.
And one other thing.

398
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,270
I want you to slip this in
Emma Kennedy's case. No way.

399
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,870
They've been all right by me so far.
I'm not doing that.

400
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,950
OK, no? If you don't want
to do it, that's fine.

401
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,290
- If you don't feel like it.
- I've done what you asked.

402
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,789
But we're not finished, are we?

403
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,990
I make one call to Social Services,
tell them you've been arrested

404
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,710
for dealing in Class-A drugs, they'll
pick your kid up within the hour.

405
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,910
You want me off your back?
Then do as you're told.

406
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:30,520
At the end of this, you'll never
have to set eyes on me again.

407
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,570
Well, here are the deeds
to your aunt's estate.

408
00:23:39,571 --> 00:23:41,769
And here's a picture of the
house in Northumberland.

409
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,030
- It's a nice gaff.
- Yes. Thank you, Miss Hunter.

410
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,790
I've just got to tell you about a
slight problem before we continue.

411
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,070
Problem? Well, as you can
see from the house there,

412
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,569
it's a couple of centuries old,
and a few years ago,

413
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,380
- it started suffering rom subsidence.
- Nasty. My nan had that.

414
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,530
Yes.

415
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:03,990
Your great-aunt Irene,
she had to get builders in,

416
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,750
and apparently, now, they're claiming
that they haven't been fully paid.

417
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,470
Can I, er, get some water? Hmm?

418
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,390
A glass of water.
I'm not being funny, but

419
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:16,239
it feels like a family of
badgers just moved in.

420
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,889
- How much are they owed?
-Sorry? These builders.

421
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,150
- How much are they owed?
- Oh. Yes. Er, 100,000.

422
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,150
One hundred grand?
For subsidence?

423
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,670
Well, it is a massive house.
And very old.

424
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,910
And as the builders are
threatening court action,

425
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,350
they will need to be paid before
the transaction can be completed.

426
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,390
Why? Sorry?

427
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,590
I mean, why before? Can't the debts
be absorbed by the estate?

428
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,870
Well, it could be, I suppose,
but time is of the essence.

429
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:48,710
The builders are threatening
to force the estate

430
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:51,470
into administration over
these unpaid bills.

431
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,470
You can't imagine how complicated
that would make things.

432
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,590
The legal fees alone would treble
what you owe the builders

433
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,870
and it could mean that you wouldn't
see your inheritance for five years.

434
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,830
I see.
And you're sure it's my aunt?

435
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:09,150
Sorry, am I sure? I'm not going to
suddenly find there's been a mix-up?

436
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,880
Not if I've done my job
properly, no.

437
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,270
I don't remember having
a Great-Aunt Irene.

438
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,150
And I don't want to 
fork out 100,000

439
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,550
and then find out I'm paying
somebody else's bloody bills.

440
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,670
I am quite sure that it is
your aunt.

441
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,510
Actually, one of the items that she
left was a sapphire bracelet,

442
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,190
very much like the one
you're wearing. A bracelet?

443
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,390
Have you got it?

444
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,600
Yes. Show me.
If you could...

445
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,710
It's just somewhere down here...

446
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:47,230
Oh. Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.
It's fine.

447
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,070
I'm always doing this.

448
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:50,969
Mum says I could start World
War III, I'm so accident prone.

449
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,080
It's fine. I can manage.

450
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,440
Miss Hunter, why don't you give
Miss Runcorn the bracelet now?

451
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,240
Well, it certainly looks authentic.

452
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,679
Yes, and it has the crest,
and everything.

453
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,120
I'll have to get it authenticated.

454
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,920
But if it's all above board, I'll
sign the papers and pay the debts.

455
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,870
That's great. Great.
You won't regret it.

456
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,630
You said we have to move quickly.
Yes. How quickly?

457
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,430
Well, it would help if you paid
the debts in cash.

458
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:44,520
Cash? I'm not sure.
They are builders.

459
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,840
Well, if it'll oil the wheels
a little, then so be it.

460
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,120
Great. Great.

461
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,910
That was good work.
Thank you.

462
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,910
Leg it. Leg it.

463
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,600
Kat.

464
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,960
Can I help you, officer?

465
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,720
Oi.

466
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,870
Guv.

467
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:28,310
Put her in the car.
That's not mine.

468
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,190
That's not mine.
I can walk there myself...

469
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,350
No.

470
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:36,750
I don't know what happened,
they just came out of nowhere.

471
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:38,750
How did she get drugs on her, Kat?
Emma doesn't even do drugs.

472
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,810
They weren't mine, if
that's what you're asking.

473
00:27:40,811 --> 00:27:43,610
I went with her, I did what
you asked me to do,

474
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:45,209
and then we went outside and...

475
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,310
Kat's right. It's not her fault.
Something else must be going on.

476
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:53,350
The cops must have planted the gear
on Emma. I'm so sorry, Sean...

477
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,390
She's at the Barber Street station.

478
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,470
She was arrested by
Detective lnspector Fisk.

479
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,750
Sid Fisk? You know him?
Yeah, he's bent as a nine bob note.

480
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:04,790
This is how he operates. He frames
people and then bangs them up.

481
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:06,590
Well, it's ridiculous.
What does Fisk want with Emma?

482
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:08,789
This can't be just about Emma.
It's about all of us.

483
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,120
I'm going to see her. On my own.
Meet me at Eddie's in an hour.

484
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
Ahem...

485
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,590
Excuse me. Roger Wyles, senior
partner, Wyles, Clark and Foster.

486
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,950
I'm representing Emma Kennedy.

487
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,390
If I am delayed from seeing my
client in any way whatsoever,

488
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,670
there will be a serious complaint
made to the IPCC.

489
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,680
- Take this gentleman down to cell
four, please. - Thank you.

490
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,720
- Fisk.
- 'Sir, Stone's come to see her.'

491
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:38,960
- Miss Kennedy. Roger Wyles.
Your solicitor. - Yeah, of course.

492
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,390
I have no idea what happened.
It's all right. It doesn't makeany sense.

493
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,030
It's OK, it's OK, we'll work it out.
How's Sean?

494
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,310
He's OK. Except he wants
to drive a JCB into the building.

495
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,710
Good plan.
Needs fine tuning.

496
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,680
Yep. I'll get you out of here, OK?
I'll think of something.

497
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,350
- We won't go further with the con on
Linda, we'll figure it out. - No.

498
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,310
- Emma... - No, I don't want you
to do that, right?

499
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,710
We've come too far. When she
gets the bracelet authenticated...

500
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,510
No, no, no, no, stop, stop.
Think a minute.

501
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,270
Look at what happened.
Look at where you are.

502
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,600
Yes. And it would feel a whole lot
worse if it was all for nothing.

503
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,550
We've done the switch.
We've shown her the paperwork.

504
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,750
All that's left to do now is collect.

505
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,440
It'd be crazy to back out now.

506
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,160
I'll keep.

507
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,830
He's got some front coming
in here, I'll give him that.

508
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,750
You want me to nick him, Guv?

509
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,230
- For what?
- Impersonating a brief?

510
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,030
Nah. I'm going to make him
an offer he can't refuse.

511
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,910
For the girl?

512
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,830
You're learning, sergeant.

513
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,230
I thought you wanted Bricks banged up.
At all costs, you said.

514
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,270
He will be.

515
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,990
The thing is, he's a clever boy,
that's why no-one's got him in the past.

516
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,790
You can't beat him at his own game.

517
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,510
So I'll play him at mine.

518
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,310
Nice and simple, no way out.

519
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,350
When he accepts my offer
and hands over the cash,

520
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,760
I'll get him for attempting
to bribe a police officer.

521
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,760
Time's up.

522
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,510
Hello, Michael.

523
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,560
Fancy a coffee?

524
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,230
She's doing my nut in.

525
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:46,090
Emma's a tough cookie.
She'll be OK.

526
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:48,289
She's not going to be OK.
Not unless we do something.

527
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,030
Like what? Boost her
from the cop shop?

528
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,210
Let's just wait until we
hear what Michael says.

529
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,209
Try not to think about it
until we hear from him.

530
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,270
- I sorted out the bin problem.
- Not now, Ed.

531
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,969
They're refurbishing
the block next door,

532
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,310
so they've got a skip, so I just
bung the bags over the wall.

533
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,950
It's not permanent, but a bloke
thinks it'll be there six months.

534
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,470
It's not a great time, Eddie.

535
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,870
Sorry, mate. I thought you might be
interested, you know, as mates.

536
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,030
Yeah, well, we just hit a bit of
a bump in the road. Oh, right.

537
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,480
Where's Em?

538
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,630
- It's Kat, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's right.

539
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,840
So what are you, like, a new
member of the crew, or what?

540
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,008
I'm not helping here, am I?

541
00:32:34,009 --> 00:32:36,109
Not really, but we'll be OK,
we'll think of something.

542
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,910
Yeah, mate, yeah, sure.
Of course you will.

543
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,760
Yeah, sure.

544
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,230
Emma Kennedy had cocaine

545
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,230
with a street value of
five grand in her bag.

546
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:51,870
She's looking at intent to supply
and a pretty hefty sentence.

547
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,030
It's funny how you know
the exact value.

548
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,710
Pay for it yourself, did you?

549
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,760
I'm sure I don't know what you're
suggesting, Michael.

550
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,590
Do you know, I have a lot of
respect for the police. I do.

551
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,870
They have a job to do and I'm fair
game, and if they can catch me, then

552
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,110
no hard feelings.

553
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,990
But a bent cop?
Someone who's not interested

554
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:15,289
in catching criminals,
just lining his own pocket.

555
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,270
That's got to be the
lowest of the low.

556
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,010
Spare me the honour amongst
thieves bullshit, Stone.

557
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,410
I couldn't be less interested
in what you think of me.

558
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:24,809
Then what are you interested in?

559
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:28,120
They told me you were a bright boy.
Spell it out for me.

560
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Fifty grand and the girl walks.

561
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:41,120
- 50 grand cash. - Shouldn't be too
steep for you. The great Mickey Bricks.

562
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,630
How do I know I can trust you?

563
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,350
You don't.

564
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,640
But as far as I can see, you
don't have much choice, do you?

565
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,670
You've always got a choice.

566
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,190
And my grandmother always told me,

567
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:02,120
never make deals with fools
or bent cops.

568
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
You're making a big mistake, Stone.

569
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,110
How is she? She's a little
shaken up, but she's coping.

570
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,790
- Is she angry with me? - No, mostly,
she's angry with herself.

571
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,030
I think we've sat here like
lemons for long enough.

572
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,270
- Let's go and help her. - I'm working
on it. - Not hard enough. - Sean.

573
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,630
No, I'm sorry, Albert, I just want
to do something.

574
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,950
This is what Fisk wants,
us losing our focus.

575
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,910
That's why he planted
the coke on Emma.

576
00:34:35,911 --> 00:34:37,609
We have to keep our heads
in what we're doing.

577
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,630
Not get distracted.

578
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:41,390
- Carry on with the con?
- Yes, all the ground work's been done.

579
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,689
We can wrap it up quickly.

580
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:46,430
- We may even need the money
to get Emma back. - He's right.

581
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,990
Now, we just have to be
extra vigilant.

582
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,150
Cover our backs every possible way.

583
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,370
If Linda's on, we can
arrange a time and a place

584
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:56,169
for the money exchange
that we control.

585
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,270
It's what Emma wants us to do.
She said that, did she?

586
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,510
Yes. She's got Linda
exactly where we want her.

587
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,040
Agreed?

588
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,230
Yeah, agreed.

589
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,400
Yeah.

590
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,040
Sean?

591
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,760
Fine.

592
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,750
Hello, Linda Runcorn?

593
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:24,310
My name is Sheldon Greyshot,
Greyshot Genealogists.

594
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:27,190
Yes, I'm afraid Miss Patterson
has been taken ill,

595
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:30,390
so I'll be dealing with
your case from now on.

596
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,110
We need you to sign some paperwork,
at your earliest convenience.

597
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,470
Are you going to let Emma go?
What's it to you?

598
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:39,230
She's my friend.
You're breaking my heart.

599
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,150
Now, are you going to tell
me what I need to know,

600
00:35:41,151 --> 00:35:42,349
or do you want to share
a cell with her?

601
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:46,449
- They're arranging a meet.
- Which will be where?

602
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:48,990
I don't know. They won't tell me.
They've all clammed up.

603
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,110
You nicking Emma
has freaked them out.

604
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,710
What about the woman? Linda Runcorn.
They must be telling her.

605
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,830
Yeah, but she ain't going
to tell me, is she?

606
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,000
No, she isn't.

607
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,790
Detective lnspector Fisk.
This is DS Loach.

608
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,220
Can we come in?

609
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,790
Con men?

610
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,430
Did they suggest there were any
outstanding charges

611
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,830
on your aunt's estate?
Mortgage payments, legal fees?

612
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,190
Yes.

613
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,990
One hundred thousand 
for subsidence.

614
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:37,910
I was about to give it to them as well.
In cash.

615
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,870
I don't believe it.

616
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:46,230
- So there's no estate? - No estate.
No dead relative. - No nothing.

617
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:50,230
- And I'm afraid the bracelet
they gave you... - What about it?

618
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,550
Well, we're going to
have to take it with us.

619
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,840
It's evidence.

620
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,070
I spoke to them yesterday.
They said they were

621
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:08,569
going to come and
collect me later today.

622
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,030
- Did they give you an address?
- No. I didn't think to ask.

623
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,710
- Did they say what time you were
being picked up? - Two o'clock. - Great.

624
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,990
- We'd like you to keep that
appointment. - Excuse me?

625
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:20,810
I want you to go along,
sign the papers,

626
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:23,009
and hand Michael Stone
the money, just as planned.

627
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,310
- Are you mad? - It is essential that
we catch him with the cash in his hand.

628
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,470
- My cash? - Yes.
- Have you lost your mind?

629
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:31,070
There'll be a team of
police officers with us.

630
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:33,569
We'll be with you every step of the way.
There's no risk at all.

631
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:36,310
No risk to you, no.
It's not your money, is it?

632
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,430
You don't even know where they're
bloody taking me, do you?

633
00:37:38,431 --> 00:37:40,129
No, but I can assure you...

634
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,110
And I can assure you the £100,000
is going back into my bank.

635
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,628
I'm sorry, I don't mind helping
you catch these people,

636
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:48,529
but I will not risk my life savings.

637
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,320
And you have no right
to ask me to do so.

638
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,470
You've got two minutes.
Thanks.

639
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,680
Sean, what are you doing here?

640
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,830
Fisk.
- Her brother's turned up.

641
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,470
Look, you shouldn't have come.

642
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,630
Well, I had to.
Nobody else is doing anything.

643
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,830
Mickey's acting like it's just a little
inconvenient hitch in his master plan.

644
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,770
That's just the way
he deals with stuff.

645
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,169
He doesn't let his
emotions get in the way.

646
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,770
That's because he doesn't
have any emotions.

647
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:20,969
Oh, Sean, come on.
Don't be stupid.

648
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,590
I'm not being stupid, when are you
going to realise you're in trouble?

649
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,790
You have to trust Mickey, OK?
We both do.

650
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,350
He'll come up with something.
He always does.

651
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,600
Yeah?
What if he doesn't this time?

652
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,550
Little family reunion, Seany?

653
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,510
Excuse me?

654
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,870
Detective lnspector Fisk.
My pals call me Sid. How is Emma?

655
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,920
Still acting tough?

656
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,070
Are you the copper
that set my sister up?

657
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,110
Yeah, I am.
And I can make it stick too.

658
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,230
I have this network
of people, you see,

659
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,030
all willing to state that they bought
Class-A drugs from your big sister.

660
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,240
Come on, then. Come on.

661
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,770
I'm not entirely sure how
it would help your sister,

662
00:39:01,771 --> 00:39:03,069
but it might be fun all the same.

663
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:05,310
Come on.

664
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,710
No?
Smart boy.

665
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,630
See, what I don't understand is

666
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,529
why Mickey wasn't interested
in the deal I offered him.

667
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:16,310
- What deal? - When he was here
posing as her brief.

668
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,070
- You spoke to Mickey?
- Like I said, I offered him a deal.

669
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,830
Fifty grand and she walks.

670
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,550
Didn't seem too much, not for
a big crew like your lot.

671
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,550
He turned me down.
You're lying.

672
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,960
Oh, what, he didn't tell you?

673
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,750
I'll get you fifty grand.
Sorry, that deal's closed.

674
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:36,510
I've got another one though.
Yeah, and what's that, then?

675
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,870
Linda Runcorn gets picked up at
two o'clock to finish a deal.

676
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,430
I want to know where
you're taking her.

677
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,390
Ten minutes after you tell me,
I have Emma released.

678
00:39:42,391 --> 00:39:43,389
You have my word on that.

679
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,430
If you don't tell me, I'll make sure
she gets ten years. Minimum.

680
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,840
Time to find out if blood's thicker
than money, Seany.

681
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,520
Need some company?

682
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,560
I'll have what he's having. Sure.

683
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,070
You worried about Emms?

684
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:23,590
Yeah, but she'll be fine, we've got
out of worse scrapes than this.

685
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,320
Yeah, you have.

686
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,070
I used to love you and Emms,
back in the day,

687
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:33,350
always looking out for each other.

688
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,030
I never had that.
I had a sister who hated my guts

689
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:40,590
and a mum who was only happy
when she was off her face.

690
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,230
You've got your little girl now.

691
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,150
Yeah. Mum's better too.
It's funny how something so little

692
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,640
can turn two people's lives around.

693
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,950
It's hard though...

694
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,870
looking out for her, making sure
she's got what she needs,

695
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,950
things that I never had.

696
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,160
I'm sure you're a great mum.

697
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,790
Well, I try my best.

698
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,670
That's the thing about family.

699
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:13,630
You do whatever you have to to
take care of them, keep them safe.

700
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,110
Yeah, you do.

701
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,510
And there ain't nothing wrong
with that, is there, Sean?

702
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,960
No, there isn't.

703
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,110
Inspector Fisk?
It's Sean Kennedy.

704
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:35,990
'I'll tell you what you want to know,
but I need to see Emma's free first.'

705
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,790
You won't regret this, kid.

706
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,320
'Yeah. I'd better not.'

707
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,550
You know what you have to do?

708
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,480
Just go along with everything
until you turn up. Exactly.

709
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,110
Afternoon. Hello.

710
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:24,350
I need to speak to Mr Gayhorse.

711
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,190
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone
here by that name.

712
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,950
I'm Sheldon Greyshot.
Who are you?

713
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,110
Oh. I've got it down as...Gayhorse.
What does that look like to you?

714
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,510
Er...Playhouse.

715
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,030
Look, it's Greyshot.
It's obviously a mistake.

716
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,430
We don't make mistakes.
We can't afford to.

717
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,390
We're from Her Majesty's Treasury. My
name is Farrow and this is Whitman.

718
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,710
You're investigating the estate of
Marcus Hambury.

719
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,270
Is there a problem.
He's wanted for tax evasion.

720
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,270
As you know, any probate
investigator's at liberty to

721
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,590
track down the heirs to intestate
assets of the deceased,

722
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,150
whatever their misdemeanours
when living.

723
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,270
Except in this case, the deceased is
alive and well and living in Hove.

724
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,030
Hove? Yes, we're afraid he might have
faked his own death to avoid capture.

725
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,070
So, we'll need a room and all the
documentation you have on the estate.

726
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:13,190
Jennifer, get the
Hambury file, will you?

727
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,790
And show these gentlemen to
meeting room one.

728
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:19,790
I've two more associates coming.
Please alert me when they arrive.

729
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:23,280
Do give their names to
the receptionist.

730
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,760
Here for the Hambury meeting. Ah,
yes, upstairs. Thank you.

731
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,520
Fisk. It's Sean.

732
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,720
Miss Runcorn. Let me take you
upstairs. We're on the second floor.

733
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,440
Get her out.
I want to see her.

734
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,400
You. Out.

735
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,510
Get off me. Where are they?
Fordham Road. Second floor.

736
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,950
You've done the right thing, Seany.
What have you done? Sean?

737
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,200
- What did you do?
- What I had to.

738
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:55,879
All units. All units.
Fordham Road. Now.

739
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,640
- Second floor?
- Up here. Is everything OK?

740
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,200
Michael Stone, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of probate fraud.

741
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,670
Are you going to paint
my portrait later?

742
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,070
Just making sure it's real.

743
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,430
What's real?

744
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,040
That we just collared the biggest
grifter in London red-handed.

745
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,190
Oh, dear, not looking
great, is it, Mickey?

746
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,488
Any advice from your
grandmother on what

747
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:13,089
to do when you're
caught bang to rights?

748
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:15,390
- Can we just get this over with?
- Should have trusted me.

749
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,910
You should have accepted my
deal when you had the chance.

750
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,230
Then I wouldn't have had to get
your boy to betray you.

751
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:26,920
- Sean? - That's right. He's the 
one who told me where to find you.

752
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,030
No, he... Why would he do...?

753
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,760
Emma's freedom.

754
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,030
So you see, I am a man
of my word, after all.

755
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,630
Make a deal with me, I stick to it.

756
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:47,110
So?

757
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,350
What do you say, Michael?

758
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,910
One hundred grand and you can walk.

759
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,710
One hundred?
It was 50 before.

760
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,030
I double it for a big cheese like you.

761
00:46:56,129 --> 00:46:59,129
You see, someone offered
me 20 grand to put you away,

762
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,400
so I need the right
incentive not to do that.

763
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,950
You get me the cash,
this will all just disappear.

764
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:12,550
- How? - I'll do what I always do when
I'm paid to make a case go away.

765
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,350
Pollute the evidence, a couple of
schoolboy errors in the paperwork,

766
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,950
and tell your brief what to look
for. You'll be out in an hour.

767
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:21,040
That's got to be worth
a hundred grand.

768
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,480
That's just what I wanted to hear.

769
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,120
What are you smiling about?

770
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,670
Ma'am.
This is Michael Stone...

771
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,530
- Mickey Bricks. - How are you, Michael?
I trust we've made you comfortable?

772
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,630
Well, it's certainly
been interesting.

773
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,320
Hard to get the staff these days.

774
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,150
What's going on here?

775
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:53,790
Michael and I had a little deal.

776
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:58,230
You know about deals, don't you,
Sidney? You'll appreciate this one.

777
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:00,400
It's very nuanced.

778
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,710
Michael was in no position to
refuse this offer.

779
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,830
I've been brought in to
clean up this department,

780
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,110
by any means necessary.

781
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,950
Starting with a certain
diseased apple called Fisk.

782
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,030
OK.
So, what do you want from me?

783
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,760
Simply to do the thing
you're best at.

784
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,190
You're a bit stuffed then, ain't ya?

785
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,870
Exactly. It's a...a thingy-o...
It's a paradox?

786
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,350
No, no. No, a catch-22?

787
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,350
No. Chinese puzzle?

788
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,630
A conundrum?

789
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:38,190
No. A mystery within a puzzle
wrapped up in an enigma?

790
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,128
So, what we going to do about Fisk?

791
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:43,129
Hang on. I know that face.
He's got something.

792
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:46,990
Michael?
Don't keep us in suspense.

793
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:50,590
A mystery within a puzzle
wrapped up in an enigma.

794
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,260
We're going to set Fisk a trap.
One he'll fall headfirst into.

795
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,390
So, Linda Runcorn.

796
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:59,710
The story is she's the CEO of an
online hotel and restaurant guide.

797
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,510
It was a straightforward
probate con, really.

798
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:07,830
Albert look into the kind of extras
you'd have to pay on an estate like that.

799
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,070
You know, bills for maintenance, loans
to fix the roof, that sort of thing.

800
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,670
So, what do you think?

801
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:16,280
Yeah, I can make that work.

802
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,390
We got Jean Kirkpatrick,

803
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,990
one of the best grifters north of
the Watford Gap to help us out.

804
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,550
We ensconced her in a Chelsea
apartment and gave her a dossier

805
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:27,830
briefing her on the character she
was supposed to play for us. Linda.

806
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,310
Nothing worse than a bent copper.

807
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:32,630
Now remember, Fisk will have us

808
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:35,910
under surveillance round the
clock, so we play this for real.

809
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:40,150
Old bag probably left me a tatty
old armchair and some cats.

810
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:44,150
Well, actually, she left jewellery.

811
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:50,150
And property worth in the
region of £4.7 million.

812
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,350
We knew your team were watching us.

813
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,870
No. There's no way you would've
known I was tailing you. No way.

814
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,430
Oh, we knew.

815
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,550
We knew you were coming after us

816
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,070
the moment you took our five grand.
Your five grand?

817
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,830
The five grand's a down payment,
there's another 15 when it's done.

818
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,240
The guy who paid you in the bar, Domino
Derek, an old poker friend of Albert's.

819
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,160
All this. Why?

820
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:28,870
I'm a good cop.

821
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,670
- Excuse me? - OK, I take the occasional
backhander, but who doesn't?

822
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,550
I'm old school. Do you know how
many villains I've put away?

823
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:38,230
The ones who didn't pay you?

824
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:42,150
So you call me a rotten apple, a
disease that needs to be rooted out,

825
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,470
then you do deals with con men?
That makes you the scab. The Judas.

826
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,310
Coppers like you were
extinct years ago.

827
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:51,670
I'm trying to do honest police work
with both my hands tied behind my back.

828
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:58,190
Honest? Planting drugs on people.
Taking bribes to let them go.

829
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:01,110
We know you threatened Kat Farmer
if she wouldn't spy for you.

830
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,960
That's the trouble with
being predictable, lnspector.

831
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,119
It meant we could
read you like a book.

832
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,990
- Yeah.
- Wainwright here.

833
00:51:13,991 --> 00:51:16,689
- I've got something for you.
- Thank you.

834
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:20,128
You using Kat actually
made our life easier.

835
00:51:20,129 --> 00:51:22,829
Really?
Well, delighted I could help.

836
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,030
Emma? Oh, she's a train crash.
But she's all right.

837
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,328
It meant we could feed
you the information

838
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:31,629
we wanted you to have
more easily.

839
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:33,010
What's this, here?
A family crest?

840
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:35,609
The Topping family.
We need it exactly the same.

841
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:36,880
By tomorrow, you said?

842
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,390
Can it be done?

843
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,390
It's not easy.
You have to get the stone right.

844
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,230
Sean and Emma Kennedy.
The newbies.

845
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:47,870
These two are Stone's
soft underbelly.

846
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,628
If we get to them, we can penetrate
the inner circle and tear it apart.

847
00:51:50,629 --> 00:51:51,529
That's how we get him.

848
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:53,710
We knew you were targeting Sean
and Emma, so we played along.

849
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,209
It's Sean Kennedy.

850
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,310
I'll tell you what you want to know,

851
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,509
but I need to see that
Emma's free first.

852
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,590
- You won't regret this, kid.
- Yeah, I'd better not.

853
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,050
We told you the bracelet
was valuable

854
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:05,830
because we knew you couldn't
resist getting your hands

855
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,529
on the extra cash
 we said it was worth.

856
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:10,249
I'm afraid the bracelet
they gave you...

857
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,610
- What about it? - Well, we're
going to have to take it with us.

858
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:16,910
You stole a bracelet you
thought was worth 50 grand,

859
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,990
and used your own money
to try and entrap us.

860
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,390
You know what you have to do?

861
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:27,080
Just go along with everything
until you turn up. Exactly.

862
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,750
He's dropped off the cash.

863
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:34,030
Ash made up an identical
package, with fake money

864
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,520
and a recording device.

865
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,200
All we had to do then was switch the
envelopes and wait for you to arrest me.

866
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:17,350
'So? What do you say, Michael?

867
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:19,750
'One hundred grand and you can walk.

868
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:22,670
'A hundred?
It was 50 before.

869
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,190
'I double it for a
big cheese like you.

870
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,510
'You see, someone offered me
20 grand to put you away,

871
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,750
'so I need the right incentive
not to do that.

872
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:33,110
'You get me the cash and this
will all just disappear.

873
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,270
'How? I'll do what I always do when
I'm paid to make a case go away.

874
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:40,550
'Pollute the evidence, a couple of
schoolboy errors in the paperwork

875
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:43,190
'and tell your brief what to look
for. You'll be out in an hour.

876
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:46,600
'That's got to be worth
a hundred grand.'

877
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,750
I was doing my job.

878
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,830
Sidney Fisk. I'm arresting you on
suspicion of corruption.

879
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,070
Hang on a minute,
I'm not the villain, here.

880
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,790
- I'm not the scumbag.
- You do not have to say anything.

881
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,830
It's OK, I know.
Know what?

882
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,040
Everything. Fisk,
what he made you do.

883
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,760
It's all right.

884
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,030
No, it ain't.
Yes, it is, listen,

885
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,990
we've taken care of it.
He won't be bothering you again.

886
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,350
You must think I'm such a skank.

887
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,760
No.

888
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,030
He said he was going to...
I know.

889
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,830
She's all I've got, Sean.

890
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,450
Listen, this is about
what Fisk did, not you...

891
00:54:55,451 --> 00:54:58,078
I know more than anyone,
people like us,

892
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,779
where we're from, you know,
we take care of our own.

893
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,690
So we're all good. OK?

894
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,350
In fact... In fact,
we're better than good.

895
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,150
- What's this?
- It's your cut.

896
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:12,910
What?

897
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,990
From the con we were working
on, the bracelet switch.

898
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,230
- But...
- It's not charity, OK? You earned it.

899
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,110
Sean, I can't take this.

900
00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:21,750
I don't deserve it,
not after what I did.

901
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:23,200
Yes, you can.

902
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,470
- I owe you.
- Call it even.

903
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:31,360
Mummy. Hello.

904
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,830
Laurel, this is Sean, say hello.

905
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,360
Hiya.

906
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,950
Take care of yourself, Kat.

907
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,360
You too, Seany...

908
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,520
Michael.

909
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,870
Come to wave me off?

910
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,470
You took a hell of a risk
carrying on with the con...

911
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,470
You should've accepted
Fisk's offer in the pub.

912
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,350
You could have ended it there and
then. Well, I was having so much fun.

913
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,190
You saw an opportunity to relieve
Fisk of his cash and you took it.

914
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,510
That's what I do.
That's dirty money.

915
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:11,950
Made from bribery and corruption,

916
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:14,230
and by rights, it belongs to
the Metropolitan Police.

917
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,710
Yeah, maybe, but we'll put
it to much better use.

918
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:21,110
What makes you think I won't
just arrest you for it?

919
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,590
You won't do that.
Won't I?

920
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:26,870
Because then, you'd have to
explain to your superiors how you

921
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:30,350
blackmailed a group of con artists
into helping you catch a bent cop.

922
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,630
Well, they did say
by any means necessary.

923
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:39,160
We could go and talk them
through it now, if you like,

924
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,599
you know, while I'm still here?

925
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,270
Goodbye, Chief lnspector.

926
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,400
Michael.

927
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,870
This was a one-off.
Starting now, the slate's clean.

928
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,590
I'm the law enforcer
and you're the criminal.

929
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,080
If I can catch you, I will.

930
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,860
I wouldn't have it any other way.

931
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,390
- So, how was she about us keeping
Fisk's money? - Fine.

932
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,168
- Fine? - Yeah, well,
she moaned for a bit,

933
00:57:25,169 --> 00:57:26,669
then I convinced her
it was for the best.

934
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,240
How was Kat?

935
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,430
OK, yeah.

936
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,070
Can we get back to normal now, please?

937
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:33,950
It didn't feel right
working for the police.

938
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:38,709
Give me tinkers and tricksters, and
gamblers and fraudsters any time.

939
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,870
At least you know where you
stand with them.

940
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:42,360
Ain't that the truth?
