1
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,258
大家好
Hello,

2
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:13,818
我是谢尔顿・库珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

3
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,458
欢迎收看由谢尔顿・库珀出品的
and welcome to the premiere episode

4
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:18,488
《有趣的旗帜》之首播集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

5
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:24,068
在接下来的五十二周  我们将一起探索
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore

6
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:27,018
旗帜学的奇妙世界
the dynamic world of vexillology.

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,208
等一下  库博士
Hang on, Dr. C.

8
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:31,028
旗帜学是什么
What's vexillology?

9
00:00:33,198 --> 00:00:36,038
旗帜学就是研究旗帜的
Vexillology is the study of flags.

10
00:00:36,718 --> 00:00:38,078
真棒
Cool.

11
00:00:39,318 --> 00:00:41,418
我想我又长见识了
I think I just learned something.

12
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,838
-你觉得有趣吗  -当然
- Did you have fun doing it? - I'll say.

13
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:50,558
这个节目具有两面性  趣味性和知识性
Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast,

14
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,688
就如同这面两面的州旗
not unlike the only two-sided state flag--

15
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,308
一面是俄勒冈洲
Oregon.

16
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:59,748
俄勒冈州该州以喜栖息于水边挖穴而居的海狸作为象征
故有海狸州的别称

17
00:00:55,908 --> 00:00:56,998
瞧
Oh, look.

18
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,748
你好  海狸先生
Hello, Mr. Beaver.

19
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:04,828
在接下来的节目里  我们会回答一些热门问题
In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions:

20
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:07,368
唯一一面不是长方形的旗帜是什么
What's the only non-rectangular flag?

21
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,918
在旗帜上出现最多的动物是什么
What animal appears most often on flags?

22
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:13,018
在旗帜上出现第二多的动物是什么
What animal appears second most often on flags?

23
00:01:13,378 --> 00:01:14,938
等等
And more.

24
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,808
太棒了
Sweet!

25
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:21,288
你为什么挥白旗
Why are you waving a white flag?

26
00:01:21,288 --> 00:01:22,588
因为太欢乐了
I'm surrendering...

27
00:01:22,588 --> 00:01:24,238
我投降了
to fun.

28
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:34,368
今天《有趣的旗帜》的内容并不有趣
Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun,

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,738
但十分重要
but it is important.

30
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:39,508
旗帜第一课  要学会如何拿
"Flags: you gotta know how to hold 'em,

31
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:41,388
如何叠
you gotta know how to fold 'em."

32
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:45,438
那我们先开始认识旗帜的结构
Let's start by identifying the parts of our flag.

33
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:48,598
这边是吊孔  用来...
This edge is the hoist, and it's used to...

34
00:01:48,598 --> 00:01:49,918
抱歉  借过一下
Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.

35
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:52,108
停
Cut.

36
00:01:52,628 --> 00:01:54,718
你没看到我们在拍吗
Did you not see we are rolling?

37
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:55,988
抱歉  我要和佩妮一起吃晚饭
Sorry. I'm having dinner with Penny.

38
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:57,188
我得赶紧出门
I have to get out of here.

39
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:58,938
而我满脑子的旗帜知识
And I have flag knowledge

40
00:01:58,938 --> 00:02:00,678
我也得让它们赶紧出来
that I have to get out of here!

41
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:07,358
你没事吧
You okay?

42
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:09,388
没事  就是有点生气
No, I'm a little rattled.

43
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:12,528
美国南北战争在萨姆特要塞打响

44
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:12,528
但就像萨姆特要塞的旗帜  我还坚守着呢
But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I'm still here.

45
00:02:14,578 --> 00:02:17,168
第二遍
And... take two.

46
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,128
大家好
Hello.

47
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,298
我是谢尔顿・库珀博士
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

48
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:22,858
欢迎收看由谢尔顿・库珀出品的
and welcome to the premiere episode

49
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,938
《有趣的旗帜》之首播集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags.

50
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:30,538
在接下来的五十二周  我们将一起探索
Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore

51
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:33,008
旗帜学的奇妙世界
the dynamic world of vexillology.

52
00:02:34,568 --> 00:02:36,218
等一下  库珀博士
Hang on, Dr. Cooper.

53
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,228
旗帜学是什么
What's vexillology?

54
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,168
旗帜学就是...
Vexillology is...

55
00:02:40,168 --> 00:02:42,118
为什么旗帜上有张脸
Why is there a face on that flag?

56
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:45,338
他叫斐迪南・T・旗帜
It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

57
00:02:45,338 --> 00:02:47,808
我觉得他能吸引少儿观众群
I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.

58
00:02:48,308 --> 00:02:50,328
真讨厌  不过没错  这主意妙
Confound it! You're right, it's brilliant.

59
00:02:50,328 --> 00:02:51,988
我们从头开始录吧
Let's take it from the top.

生活大爆炸  第五季第十四集

69
00:03:16,748 --> 00:03:18,988
晚饭真不错
That was a really nice dinner.

70
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:20,548
我很开心你又约我出去了
I'm glad you asked me out again.

71
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:22,558
我也是  我很想你
Me, too; I missed you.

72
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,998
你天天都能看到我
You see me all the time.

73
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,228
你确定你想的不是滚床单的部分吗
You sure you just don't miss the sex?

74
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:30,988
好吧  和你滚床单的感觉是很棒
Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great.

75
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:32,538
你试过吗
Have you ever tried it?

76
00:03:34,248 --> 00:03:36,578
试过  你说的没错
I have. You are not wrong.

77
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:39,508
我只是觉得  如果我们要复合的话
I just think if we're gonna try dating again,

78
00:03:39,508 --> 00:03:41,868
应该慢慢来
we should take things slow.

79
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:44,218
我可以慢慢来啊
Oh, I can take it slow.

80
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,638
我有和你说过我高中时的第一任女友
Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school,

81
00:03:46,638 --> 00:03:48,208
凯伦・波布瑞克吗
Karen Berberick?

82
00:03:48,278 --> 00:03:50,698
至今她都不知道当时我们是在约会
To this day she doesn't know we were going out.

83
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:55,388
不过这么一来  分手的时候就容易多了
Made it easier on her when I broke things off.

84
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,598
好吧  也不要那么慢
Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

85
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:01,038
那这样吧
How about this,

86
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:04,508
你知道电脑软件通常是怎么开发的吗
are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?

87
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,188
为了好玩  就当我不知道好了
You know, just for fun, let's say I'm not.

88
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,138
在一款应用程序发布之前
Before an application is released,

89
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:11,698
都会先进行测试
they give it a trial run.

90
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:13,178
我们可以这么做
W-We could do that.

91
00:04:13,178 --> 00:04:16,258
如果我们遇到分歧  不要生气
And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad,

92
00:04:16,258 --> 00:04:18,218
就当是发现了个问题
just say, "Hey, we found a bug,"

93
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,358
把问题报告出来  然后修复
and we report it so it can be fixed.

94
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,078
是像公开测试那种吗
You mean like a beta test?

95
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:26,148
严格上来说  这是内部测试
Well, technically, this would be an alpha test.

96
00:04:26,148 --> 00:04:28,488
公开测试是给没参与
A beta test requires people that weren't involved

97
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:29,468
程序开发的无关人士...
in the development of the appli...

98
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,408
我好歹知道"公开测试"  不该表扬一下吗
Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?

99
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:34,958
当然
No, you should.

100
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,858
当然了  是我在卖弄学问
Absolutely. That was me being pedantic.

101
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:39,078
这是我们的第一个问题
That's our first bug.

102
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,508
你报告了
You reported it.

103
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:41,498
我修复了
I can fix that.

104
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,048
看见吗  这样不错
See? This is good.

105
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:45,488
好吧  那我们就试试
All right. Let's give it a shot.

106
00:04:45,488 --> 00:04:47,288
很好  咱俩都列个单子记录
Great. You keep a list, I'll keep a list.

107
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:49,248
到时候再交换
At some point, we'll exchange.

108
00:04:50,338 --> 00:04:51,638
好
Okay.

109
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:53,108
-晚安  莱纳德  -晚安
- Good night, Leonard. - Night.

110
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,228
干得好  霍夫斯塔德
Attaboy, Hofstadter.

111
00:05:00,228 --> 00:05:01,748
没什么比喻能比软件开发
Nothing gets the ladies hotter

112
00:05:01,748 --> 00:05:04,168
更能让女人兴奋
than software development analogies.

113
00:05:07,218 --> 00:05:08,328
我回来了
Hey, I'm back.

114
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:10,058
停
Cut.

115
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:16,008
第四十七遍
Take 47.

116
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,908
告诉你一件旗帜的趣事
Here's an interesting fact about flags.

117
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:23,388
我就当你自动开录了
I will take that action.

118
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,498
列支敦斯登和海地的国旗
The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti

119
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:28,538
以前碰巧是一样的
were identical by coincidence,

120
00:05:28,538 --> 00:05:30,928
直到两国在1936年奥运会对战时
a fact that wasn't discovered until they competed

121
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:33,668
才发现这个巧合
against each other at the 1936 Olympics.

122
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:37,488
1936年西班牙人民开始反法西斯斗争
其内战被称为"小二战"

123
00:05:33,788 --> 00:05:35,808
不过幸好  当时西班牙内战拯救了
And thankfully,their embarrassment was overshadowed

124
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:37,488
让两国的尴尬
by the rise of Fascism.

125
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:42,218
看看你的新手机
Let's see the new phone.

126
00:05:42,698 --> 00:05:44,258
我在上班路上买的
I stopped on the way to work.

127
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,268
你要不要跟我一起揭开贴膜
Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?

128
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:50,178
我何德何能呀
Really? Me?

129
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,358
这可是最棒那部分呀
That's, like, the best part.

130
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,738
从边上揭吧
Grab a corner.

131
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,798
喂  别这么猴急  粗鲁牛仔
Whoa, what's your hurry, cowboy?

132
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,428
享受这一刻
Savor the moment.

133
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:14,728
太他妈爽了
Oh, yeah.

134
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,598
说到牛仔
Speaking of cowboys,

135
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:23,268
知道哪个国家的国旗印着两只牛吗
do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag?

136
00:06:23,268 --> 00:06:26,118
内陆小国家  安道尔共和国
The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra.

137
00:06:26,318 --> 00:06:27,438
由谢尔顿・库珀出品的
Oh, the next classic episode

138
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:28,948
《旗帜的乐趣》  精彩下一集
of Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun with Flags

139
00:06:28,948 --> 00:06:30,878
题材如泉涌呀
is writing itself.

140
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:35,038
让我试试语音识别功能
Oh, let me try the voice recognition.

141
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,128
去  人家都让你揭膜了  别得寸进尺
Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don't get greedy.

142
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:42,868
你好
Hello?

143
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:44,638
你好
Hello.

144
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,138
你叫什么名字
What's your name?

145
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:50,558
我的名字叫Siri
My name? It's Siri.

146
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:51,668
瞧瞧
Look at that.

147
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:54,328
终于出现一个你敢跟她讲话的女人了
There's finally a woman in your life you can talk to.

148
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:56,948
你现在是单身吗
Are you single?

149
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,668
如果你是问婚姻状况的话
I don't have a marital status,

150
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,308
我没有这个属性
if that's what you're asking.

151
00:07:01,968 --> 00:07:03,448
也是  这个问题太私人了
Yeah, you're right, that's too personal.

152
00:07:03,448 --> 00:07:05,228
我们才刚认识
We hardly know each other.

153
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:08,798
去喝杯咖啡怎么样
How about a cup of coffee?

154
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:11,148
我找到六个咖啡馆
I've found six coffee shops.

155
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:13,708
其中三个离你很近
Three of them are fairly close to you.

156
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:17,208
先生们回见啦
I will see you gentlemen later.

157
00:07:23,108 --> 00:07:25,428
她铁定让他心碎
She is gonna break his heart.

158
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:33,358
对于利用时光机
For someone who has a machine

159
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:35,448
穿越时空的人
that can travel anywhere in time and space,

160
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,478
《神秘博士》  英国科幻电视剧

161
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:38,478
神秘博士对现代的伦敦还真是情有独钟
Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.

162
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,588
注意点  说这种无礼的话
Careful, it's that kind of sass

163
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,958
会让你被今年神秘会谈的拒之门外
that can get a person uninvited to this year's Who Con.

164
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,358
我们这次不算约会吧
Uh, we're not counting this as a date, are we?

165
00:07:52,228 --> 00:07:54,868
我不确定
Um, I'm not sure,

166
00:07:54,868 --> 00:07:57,678
不过我觉得正确答案应该是"不算"
but I think the right answer here is "no."

167
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:02,368
问题报告  当异性约我出来
Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him,

168
00:08:02,368 --> 00:08:04,438
他是不是应该安排一些更有趣的事
maybe he plans something a little more interesting

169
00:08:04,438 --> 00:08:06,938
而不是坐在家里看电视
than hanging out at home, watching TV.

170
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:09,298
《神秘博士》也没趣?
Even <i>Doctor Who?</i>

171
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:12,008
《神秘博士》很没趣
Even <i>Doctor Who.</i>

172
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,748
够了  神秘会谈没你份
All right, that's it. Who Con-- you're out.

173
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:19,608
好的  问题报告已收到
Okay, bug report taken.

174
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,258
下次我会安排更好的夜晚活动
Next time I will have a better plan for our evening's activity.

175

谢谢  明天见
Well, thank you. I'll see you tomorrow.

176
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,808
等等  我差点忘了
Oh, wait, here, almost forgot.

177
00:08:28,778 --> 00:08:30,398
-给  -这是什么
- Here. - What's this?

178
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:31,718
我记录你的问题报告
My bug report to you.

179
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:42,548
这表列得还挺长的嘛
Well, that's quite a list you got there.

180
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,138
有分颜色标记
It's color coded.

181
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,368
红色的代表"马上修复"
Uh, red means "fix right away."

182
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:54,068
黄色的代表"有时间再说"
Yellow is "eh, whenever you get a chance."

183
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:58,188
绿色的代表"我应该可以适应"
And green, is "I could probably learn to live with it."

184
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:00,628
最下面还有标注呢
There's a key down here at the bottom.

185
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:02,028
一目了然吧
It's neat, huh?

186
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:05,478
是
Yep.

187
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:10,058
那晚安啦
So, have a good night.

188
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,128
好
Yep.

189
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:17,358
瞧瞧
Look at that.

190
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:19,918
将来我们可以告诉后人
Some day, we will tell future generations

191
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:21,888
约会变得不再困难
that dating used to be hard.

192
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,808
我不解的是你能列出什么问题
What's baffling me is what you could've possibly put on the list.

193
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,548
"秀发太金黄"?
"Hair too golden"?

194
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:31,258
"笑声太动听"?
"Laugh too musical"?

195
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:33,668
"她的出现"
"World too much a better place

196
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:35,638
"让世界更美好"?
for her mere presence in it"?

197
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,868
"经常说话的时候满嘴食物"  这条怎么样
How about "constantly talks with food in her mouth"?

198
00:09:40,698 --> 00:09:43,538
她内心充满爱  没人会在意她嘴里有什么
Her heart's full of love, no one cares what's in her mouth.

199
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,508
Siri
So, Siri,

200
00:09:51,648 --> 00:09:53,658
怎么样  你最近好吗
what's happening? How are you?

201

你还能在干什么
What am I doing?

谢谢  有人欣赏很真好
Thank you, it's nice to be appreciated.

207
00:10:12,148 --> 00:10:13,888
这是自然
I bet it is.

208
00:10:15,998 --> 00:10:17,758
为什么没有女人喜欢我
Why don't women like me?

209
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,738
我查查看
Let me check on that.

210
00:10:23,058 --> 00:10:26,628
网页搜索下"为什么没有女人喜欢我"怎么样
How about a Web search for "Why don't women like me?"

211
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,288
不用了  我早就搜过了
No need. I've already done that.

212
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,058
Siri  你有姓吗
Siri, do you have a last name?

213
00:10:34,408 --> 00:10:35,998
我名叫Siri
My name is Siri.

214
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,178
只有名啊
Ah, one name.

215
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:41,478
像雪儿  麦当娜 阿黛尔
Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele.

216
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:44,388
她们的声音都让我荡漾
All the women who rock me.

217
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:48,888
我名叫拉杰什  但你可以叫我拉杰
My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.

218
00:10:49,238 --> 00:10:51,448
你想要我叫你拉杰吗
Would you like me to call you Raj?

219
00:10:51,838 --> 00:10:53,818
我想要你叫我帅哥
I'd like you to call me sexy.

220
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:59,218
从现在起  我叫你帅哥  好吗
From now on, I'll call you sexy. Okay?

221
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:02,998
好啊
Okay!

222
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:12,662
Siri  我想吃意大利冰激凌
Siri, I'm in the mood for gelato.

223
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,862
我找到了十家评论里有意大利冰激凌的餐厅
I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato.

224
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:19,382
其中七家离你相当近
Seven of them are fairly close to you.

225
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:21,092
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, darling.

00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:25,922

228
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:33,272
怎么了
I'm sorry?

229
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,522
你迈出了革命性的一步
You've taken a great evolutionary leap

230
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,752
你放弃了和人类的互动
by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself

231
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:41,392
却爱上了和冷冰冰的机器打情骂俏
to romantically bond with a soulless machine.

232
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,382
Kudos  一款虚拟人生游戏的名字

233
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,382
赞一个

234
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,752
我没爱上它
I haven't bonded with it.

235
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:48,402
是的  那当然
Oh, no, of course.

236
00:11:48,402 --> 00:11:49,452
我懂得
I understand.

237
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:53,012
你害怕这世界还不能接受你的禁忌之爱
You're afraid the world isn't ready for your taboo love.

238
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,802
我会守口如瓶的
Your secret's safe with me.

239
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,942
这只是个手机
It's just a phone.

240
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,562
库珀
Cooper.

241
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:07,582
克莱皮克

通报

243
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,872
克莱皮克把所有l和r的音发成了w

244
00:12:09,882 --> 00:12:12,872
莱曼教授又在粒子物理实验"司"撒尿了
Professor Rothman urinated in the particle physics wab again,

245
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,252

246
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:18,332
星"基"五  五点  自带"饲"品

00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:28,202
你用Siwi  对吧

语音"私"别系统真是"罩"透了
Voice wecognition on that thing is tewwible.

253
00:12:30,152 --> 00:12:31,112
"侃"

Siwi  你能"腿"荐个"番"馆吗
Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?

255
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,572
对不起  巴尼[里]
I'm sorry, Bawwy.

256
00:12:42,362 --> 00:12:46,212
我不懂什么是"腿荐个番馆"
I don't understand "wecommend a westauwant."

257
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:51,082
"钉"我说
Wisten to me.

258
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:53,422
不是"番"馆  是"番"馆
Not westauwant; westauwant.

259
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:56,912
我不明白什么是
I don't know what you mean

260
00:12:56,912 --> 00:13:00,162
"不是番馆  是番馆"
by "not westauwant; westauwant."

261
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,322
瞧  "肥"物一个
See? Total cwap.

262
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,532
Siwi  你烂死了
You suck, Siwi.

263
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,862
嘿  不要跟她这么说
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

264
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:07,542
她是位女士
She's a lady.

265
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:11,012
"作"晚  这位"奴"士给我的老二

266
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:13,362

of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist.

267
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,452
"挥"头见
Waiter.

268
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:20,282
门没关
It's open.

269
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:24,152
你准备走了吗
You ready to go?

270
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:26,672
等等  让我把这章看完
Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.

271
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,192
你不能晚点看吗
Can you finish it later?

272
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,472
不行
No, I can't.

273
00:13:30,472 --> 00:13:33,572
看书现在是我生活中重要的一部分  因为...
Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know,

274
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:37,412
我看得越多  我们的共同话题就越多
we'd have more fun things to talk about if I read more.

275
00:13:41,242 --> 00:13:42,772
太好了  太好了
Great. Good. Great.

276
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,502
你在看什么
What are you reading?

277
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:46,452
两星期腹肌速成
Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.

278
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:51,122
光书名就剧透了  不是吗
They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don't they?

279
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:53,672
好的
All right.

280
00:13:54,122 --> 00:13:56,692
听着  要记住我们的约定
Look, just remember how this works.

281
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,642
不能因为这些事情生气
We don't get mad about these things.

282
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,442
说到这  我根据你的问题报告
Uh, speaking of which, I've addressed

283
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,582
修正了我今晚的约会安排
your bug report on my date planning.

284
00:14:02,832 --> 00:14:04,562
今晚的节目很有意思
Got a really fun evening for you.

285
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:05,672
算是个惊喜吧
It's kind of a surprise.

286
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:07,632
好的  很好
All right. Terrific.

287
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:09,892
那让我找双不那么高的鞋子
Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren't so tall.

288
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,832
这样你就不会觉得
We wouldn't want you to feel like you were

289
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:14,022
是在跟自己的妈妈散步
out for a walk with your mommy.

290
00:14:17,672 --> 00:14:19,612
谢谢
Thank you.

291
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:23,092
这是我给你的报告  放这儿了
Here's my list for you-- right there.

292
00:14:29,472 --> 00:14:31,042
好的  有来有往
All right, fair enough.

293
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:35,312
接吻的时候  我当然能安静点
I certainly can be quieter when we kiss.

294
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:38,632
我原以为这是热情的表示
I thought it was an expression of passion,

295
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:40,472
但是如果被形容为"很湿很奇怪"
but if it's coming across as "juicy and weird,"

296
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:42,092
我宁愿作罢
who wants that?

297
00:14:46,612 --> 00:14:48,242
不好意思
Uh, uh... I'm sorry.

298
00:14:48,242 --> 00:14:52,232
你能解释下  我的眉毛"很笨"是什么是意思
Can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are "stupid"?

299
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,942
不用了  看见了
No, never mind. It's right here.

300
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:02,742
来得正好
Good timing.

301
00:15:02,742 --> 00:15:03,972
饭菜都快准备好了
Dinner's almost ready.

302
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:04,932
太好了
Great.

303
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:07,122
闻起来很不错
Oh, smells amazing in here.

304
00:15:07,122 --> 00:15:08,212
我们吃什么
Oh, what are we eating?

305
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:09,742
来点异域风情
Oh, an exotic little treat.

306
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,402
我正在跟Siri谈北京烤鸭
I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck,

307
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:14,762
她说她知道四家中国食品店
and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers,

308
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:16,472
其中两家离这很近
two of which were fairly close to me.

309
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:19,912
我被她自发性的语音功能传染了
Her spontaneity is contagious.

310
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,192
Siri是谁啊
Who's Siri?

311
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:24,962
他有新女友了吗
Is he dating somebody new?

312
00:15:24,962 --> 00:15:27,082
是啊  他手机嘛
Yes. His phone.

313
00:15:30,322 --> 00:15:32,522
这该算是可爱还是可怕啊
Is that cute or creepy?

314
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:37,662
我给你们倒点酒吧
Can I pour you some wine?

315
00:15:37,662 --> 00:15:39,492
你们会喜欢的
I think you'll enjoy it.

316
00:15:39,492 --> 00:15:41,102
一般来说  北京烤鸭是佐以
The traditional choice with Peking duck

317
00:15:41,102 --> 00:15:42,292
长相思葡萄酒而食
is a sauvignon blanc,

318
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:42,292
另译白苏维翁  一种果香丰富的白葡萄酒

319
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:44,952
但Siri建议我采用非干型威士莲佐餐
but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.

320
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:45,402
非干型:形容葡萄酒有一些甜味 但不是很甜
威士莲:最精致的白葡萄酒品种

321
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,132
我也不确定
I wasn't sure,

322
00:15:46,132 --> 00:15:47,422
但我实在不想
but I didn't want to have an argument

323
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:49,702
在乔氏超市连锁店跟她吵起来
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.

324
00:15:53,732 --> 00:15:57,842
该让Siri穿什么衣服赴宴呢
Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner?

325
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,092
性感的豹纹壳  闪耀的钻石壳
Leopard, sparkles,

326
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,992
可可・香奈儿  20世纪法国设计师

327
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,992
或者用可可・香奈儿的话来说
or to paraphrase Coco Chanel,

328
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:07,862
黑色是永不出错的颜色
you can never go wrong with a little black case?

329
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,412
Siri  为我们奏一曲抒情爵士乐吧
Siri, play some smooth jazz.

330
00:16:14,072 --> 00:16:15,982
播放抒情爵士乐
Playing smooth jazz.

331
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,242
凯丽・金  全球最著名的高音萨克斯风名家

332
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:22,242
天啊  是凯丽・金的曲子
Oh, my God, Kenny G?!

333
00:16:22,672 --> 00:16:24,942
这个女人简直把我看透了
This woman can read me like a book.

334
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,032
我不敢相信居然在格兰岱尔凯丹广场  买到了我的灵魂伴侣
I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.

335
00:16:35,302 --> 00:16:37,742
我觉得我待不下去了
I don't know if I want to stay.

336
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:50,392
这简直酷毙了
This is amazing.

337
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:51,922
你是怎么想到这主意的
How did you even get this idea

338
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:52,952
我打电话给你爸
I called your dad.

339
00:16:53,242 --> 00:16:55,942
问他你小时候都爱玩些什么
I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid.

340
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:57,892
来这里比找头牛让你玩推到
This seemed easier than getting a cow out here

341
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,292
容易多了
so you could tip it.

342
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:04,412
你真是棒极了
Okay, you're kind of really great.

343
00:17:04,722 --> 00:17:06,622
你是在夸一个按摩你脖子时
You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like

344
00:17:06,622 --> 00:17:09,442
就像老鹰要把你叼回巢里的人吗
an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?

345
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,362
问题报告
Okay, bug report.

346
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:13,382
我刚夸奖了你
I just complimented you.

347
00:17:13,382 --> 00:17:14,622
你应该欣然接受  然后闭嘴
You should take it and shut up.

348
00:17:14,622 --> 00:17:15,912
好  我错了  对不起
Right. Sorry, sorry.

349
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:17,222
不要没完没了地向我道歉
And stop apologizing all the time.

350
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:18,352
好  对不起
Right. Sorry.

351
00:17:19,912 --> 00:17:21,802
好啦  咱们开练吧
All right, let's shoot stuff.

352
00:17:21,802 --> 00:17:23,172
需要我教你怎样射击吗
You want me to show you what to do?

353
00:17:24,242 --> 00:17:25,912
我可是个玩《侠盗猎车手》的老手
I play a lot of <i>Grand Theft Auto.</i>

354
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,862
玩起手枪可是驾轻就熟
I think I know how to handle a gat.

355
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:32,092
你痞里痞气的时候还真可爱
Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta.

356
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:46,072
现在我多了处枪伤
So, I've got a gunshot wound.

357
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:49,392
痞子感更十足了吧
That's pretty bad-ass.

358
00:17:50,442 --> 00:17:53,162
才不是呢  是你的锐步鞋上多了处枪伤
No, you've got a Reebok with a gunshot wound

359
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,562
你那粉嫩的脚趾头不过是擦伤
and an ouchie on your pinky toe.

360
00:17:57,072 --> 00:17:58,792
拜托  医生给我贴了个创可贴
Hello? They gave me a Band-aid.

361
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:00,122
医院不能随便给病人开创可贴的
Hospitals do not issue Band-aids

362
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,572
除非是伤情严重  万不得已
unless it is medically necessary.

363
00:18:01,572 --> 00:18:03,052
这可是法律规定
That is the law.

364
00:18:05,372 --> 00:18:08,422
今晚酷毙了  谢谢你
Well, thank you for a really cool evening.

365
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,452
也谢谢你在急诊室帮我
Thank you for hiding my <i>Star Wars</i> socks

366
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:11,992
把《星球大战》的袜子藏起来
at the emergency room.

367
00:18:14,222 --> 00:18:17,242
现在我们是不是评估下公测
Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test

368
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:18,872
看看我们的进展了
and see where we stand?

369
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,052
前途一片光明
Things are looking good.

370
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:23,302
那么  我们还要慢慢来吗
So, are we still taking things slow?

371
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,842
鉴于今天我受了枪伤
Because a gunshot wound today,

372
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:25,432
而上周
and last week,

373
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,072
我的大拇指被厨房的抽屉给夹伤
I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer.

374
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,122
我估计我命不久矣
We don't know how much time I have.

375
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:32,162
晚安
Good night, you.

376
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:50,032

有什么需要我效劳
