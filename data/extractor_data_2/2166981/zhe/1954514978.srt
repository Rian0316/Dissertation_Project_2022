1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,580
要知道 犯罪生涯的阴暗面之一就是
You know, one of the downsides to a life of crime

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,700
你必须时不时地同某些人打交道 唔...
is that occasionally you have to do business with people who are, um...

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,380
嗯 说得好听点 罪犯们
Well, for want of a better word, criminals.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,180
像大多数不得善终的事情一样
Like most things that end with you hanging upside down

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,060
即便你最终被倒吊在废弃的仓库里
in a deserted warehouse,

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,380
刚开始它可的确是条妙计
it started with a really good idea.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,460
"《花园中的小猫》由巴勃罗・毕加索绘于1903年
"A Small Cat In The Garden was painted by Pablo Picasso in 1903,

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,820
"这一时期被称之为他的蓝色时期
"in what was known as his Blue Period.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:34,940
"画的尺寸为12x11英寸 星期天的凌晨时分 
"It measures 12 inches by 11 inches and was stolen from a private collection

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,220
"从私人藏品里偷取"
"in the early hours of Sunday morning."

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,420
嗯...值多少?
Mmmm... Value?

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,620
-投保金额有3百万  -哇奥
-It's been insured for three million.  -Wow.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,820
"警方说 盗窃团伙显然经验老道 消息灵通"
"Police say the gang was clearly experienced and well informed."

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,340
-意思是偷这幅画是有的放矢  -这毫无疑问
-Meaning it was stolen to order.  -No question.

15
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,660
-疯子Dolly还在附近吗?  -我也在想
-Is Mad Dolly still around?  -My thoughts exactly.

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,310
谁?
Who?

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,840
Dolly Hammond
Dolly Hammond,

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,820
在伦敦 她仿造的毕加索作品是最逼真的
she's the best Picasso forger in London.

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,660
她人不错 就是有一点...她...比较特立独行
She's all right, but she's just a bit.... She's...unique.

20
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,740
是的 她是有点儿与众不同 这你懂
Yeah, she's a bit different, you know.

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,780
-疯疯癫癫的  -对 没错
-Insane.  -Yeah. Nice.

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,620
实际上她是个可爱的老精明鬼 但是 额...
She's a lovely old bird really, but, erm...

23
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,540
她过去曾迷恋Albie
she used to have the hots for Albie.

24
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,180
既然画已经被偷 为什么我们还要找人伪造它?
Why would we need someone to forge a painting that's already been stolen?

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,980
恩 是因为现在失窃一事已经被报道了...
Well, because now its theft has already been reported...

26
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,210
如果你告诉收藏家们你试图卖掉这幅画
Collectors will believe you

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,460
他们会相信你的是真品
if you tell 'em you're trying to sell it.

28
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,300
这主意棒极了!
It's brilliant!

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,860
-是的没错  -是的没错  -一向如此
-Yes, it is.  -Yes, it is.  -As always.

30
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,020
呃 看起来棒极了
Well, potentially brilliant.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,020
这取决于你想把赝品卖给谁
Depending on who you try and sell the fake to.

32
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,900
给你一个小忠告
And here's a little tip

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,020
如果你想非法销售毕加索的赝品...
should you ever find yourself trying to flog a fake Picasso...

34
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,020
可别把它卖给
Don't try and sell it to the bloke

35
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,620
真品最初的主人 画可是从那儿偷的
who the original was nicked from in the first place.

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,620
好了好了 骑兵们来了
Aye-aye. Here come the cavalry.

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,740
Ash!
Ash!

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,940
轻点 Sean 轻点!
Gently, Sean, gently!

39
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,340
噢...
Oooh...

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,820
-Mickey在哪?  -他们拿枪对着我们呢
-Where's Mickey?  -They pulled a gun on us.

41
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,730
Petre Sava的人抓了他
Petre Sava's men have taken him.

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,340
发生什么了?
What happened?

43
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,710
啊 说来话长
Well, it's a very long story,

44
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,060
但结果是真品一开始就从他那儿被偷了
but the upshot is the original was nicked from him in the first place.

45
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,020
我们告诉他是我们偷了画
He wasn't happy at us telling him it was us who nicked it,

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,060
然后打算卖他幅假的来代替真的 他就怒了
and then trying to sell him a fake back instead of the real thing.

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,420
这不是毕加索!
This is NOT Picasso!

48
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,540
这不是我的画!
This is not my painting!

49
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,450
所以在我们把真的毕加索还给他之前
So Petre Sava is holding on to Mickey

50
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,940
Petre Sava是不会放了Mickey的
till we deliver the real Picasso back to him.

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,290
我们又没有真品
We haven't got the real one.

52
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,500
对 这一点我强调过了 为此我们还争了一会
No, I did mention that, and we argued for a bit,

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,780
然后他威胁会暴力相加
then he threatened a level of physical violence

54
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,060
我对此很是不喜欢 所以放弃了
I wasn't comfortable with, so I backed down.

55
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,340
他给我们6小时找到它
He's given us six hours to find it.

56
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,340
如果我们找不到真画会怎样?
So what happens if we can't find the real painting?

57
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,340
哦 这一点他说得特详细
Oh, he was very specific about that.

58
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,260
Mickey必死无疑
Mickey's a dead man.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:16,300
<font color=#00FF00>《斗智天王》 第8季 第2集</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Hustle S08E02 720p HDTV x264</font>

60
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,260
这么说没人发现任何线索?但这不可能
So no-one's got anything? But that's impossible.

61
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,860
嗯 这不是当地团伙犯的案
Well, it's not a local crew.

62
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,630
如果是的话 肯定有知情者
Someone would know if it was.

63
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:01,420
目前真画很可能已经被运出国了
By now the real painting could've been shipped out of the country.

64
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,950
但没人听到任何动静也太奇怪了
But it's weird that no-one's heard anything.

65
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,060
或者他们有 却不愿拿出来分享
Or if they have, they don't want to share it.

66
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,710
Dolly仿造画的人那边呢?
What about that Dolly the forger?

67
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,700
如果她是毕加索的狂热爱好者
If she's a Picasso freak,

68
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,260
她应该会听说点什么消息
she might have heard something.

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,900
我想...
I suppose...

70
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,300
-是啊 对 没错 能试试  -我们行动吧
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's worth a try.  -Let's do it.

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,040
如今都找不到个有水准的大盗了
Can't find a decent thief these days,

72
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,980
全都是些匪徒 真上不了台面
they're all gangsters, they've got no class.

73
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,780
-不像你 Albert  -谢谢你 Dolly
-Not like you Albert.  -Thank you, Dolly.

74
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,740
我真想把他们用睾丸串起来
I'd string 'em all up. By the testicles.

75
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,740
丢出去让乌鸦啄
Leave them there for the crows to pick at.

76
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,780
剩下的就喂猪 像我们过去常做的那样
Feed what's left to the pigs, like we used to.

77
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,340
Dolly 你知不知道是谁偷了那幅毕加索?
So you've no idea who stole the Picasso, Dolly?

78
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,660
-哪幅毕加索?  -《花园中的小猫》
-What Picasso?  -A Small Cat In The Garden.

79
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:45,540
你的仿制品我已经画好给你了
You've had your copy, I've already done it.

80
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,420
不不 我说的是那幅真品
No, no, I'm talking about the real one.

81
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,660
他真可爱
He's cute.

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,810
Dolly 那幅画 你知道是谁偷的吗?
Dolly, the painting, have you any idea who nicked it?

83
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,020
这种事我怎么知道?
How would I know that?

84
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,240
-有人跟你说过什么吗?  -谁?
-Has no-one said anything to you?  -Who?

85
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,660
-随便谁  -说什么?
-Anyone.  -Said what?

86
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,460
-关于画的事  -什么画?
-About the painting.  -What painting?

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,690
-毕加索的画  -我不知道谁偷了它
-The Picasso.  -I don't know who nicked it.

88
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,000
额 我就问这个 不是吗?
Well, that's what I'm asking, innit?

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,540
我已经告诉你了 你是谁?
I've told you. Who are you?

90
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,580
哦...我是Emma
Oh... I'm Emma.

91
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,300
你在我家做什么?
What are you doing in my house?

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,820
我和Albert一起的
I'm with Albert.

93
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,180
她是你的小情妇 对吗?
This your floozy, is it?

94
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,100
不不不不 Dolly 你是我唯一的女人
No, no, no, no. You're the only woman for me, Dolly.

95
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
噢!啊...不好意思啦
Ohhh! Aah...unlucky.

96
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,780
Dolly 你对这幅画一点儿都不知情?
Dolly, do you know anything at all about the painting?

97
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,340
任何能帮我们找到窃贼的线索都行
Anything that might help us find out who nicked it?

98
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,260
我是说 有没有谁非常爱这幅画?私人收藏家?
I mean, was there someone who really liked it? A private collector?

99
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,940
或者有谁之前想买却没买到手?任何相关的事都行
Or did someone try and buy it before and failed? Anything.

100
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,460
我知道伦敦每一幅毕加索的藏地
I know where every Picasso in London is.

101
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,260
我能嗅出来
I can smell them.

102
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,500
除了这一幅
Except this one.

103
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Dolly 听着 你有什么办法找到它吗?
Dolly, look, is there any way you can track it down, you know?

104
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,220
我是说 街头巷尾都流传些什么消息?
I mean, what's the word on the street?

105
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,900
我看上去像抱抱熊吗?
Do I look like Huggy Bear?

106
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,020
Dolly!我们需要找到它
Dolly! We need to find it.

107
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,220
我会想想我能做些什么的 只要...
I'll see what I can do, if...

108
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,700
..他对我唱唱歌
..he sings to me,

109
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,140
他亲亲我
and he snogs me.

110
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,500
# 你好 Dolly 呀 你好 Dolly #
# Hello Dolly, well, Hello Dolly #

111
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,100
# 你回来真好 回到你属于的地方! #
# It's so nice to have you back where you belong! #

112
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,540
哦...
Oh...

113
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,460
不
No.

114
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,790
算了吧 别... 别这样
Forget it. It's...it's not happening.

115
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,100
Sean 想想Mickey
Sean, think about Mickey.

116
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,660
-别提Mickey  -亲一下吧
-Forget Mickey.  -Do it.

117
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,540
我不想...做这事
I don't want to... Do it.

118
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,940
-我不想!  -Sean...
-Don't want to!  -Sean...

119
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,060
真顽皮!
Naughty!

120
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,980
怎样?
Well?

121
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,060
额...嗯 几个小时内我应该就能知道
Erm...well, I should know in a couple of hours.

122
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
派他来
Send him.

123
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,770
现在 以防Dolly想不出线索
Now, just in case Dolly draws a blank,

124
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,100
我们最好全面行动起来
we'd better cover all the angles.

125
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,620
Albert 同警方联络下
Albert, use your police contacts,

126
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,140
看看他们那儿有什么线索
see if they've got any leads on the robbery

127
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,380
-或者知道可能会是谁  -行
-or any idea who it was.  -Right.

128
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,670
Sean 你开车 
Sean, take the car.

129
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,620
看看能不能查到Petre Sava的其他信息
See what else you can find out about Petre Sava.

130
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:02,740
好
OK.

131
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,220
-我们干什么?  -你跟我去见Cyclops
-What about us?  -You and me will go and see Cyclops.

132
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,480
虽然艺术品不是他的菜
Now, art's not really his thing,

133
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,100
但他也许会听到些消息
but he might have heard something.

134
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,020
我有一幅《玩斯诺克的狗》可以吗?
I've got The Dogs Playing Snooker, if that's any good to you?

135
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,420
那可是经典作品
It's a classic.

136
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,860
我曾经有幅《在网球场上挠她屁股的鸟》
I used to have The Bird On The Tennis Court Scratching Her Bum,

137
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,980
但它在家庭纠纷中被高跟鞋划坏了
but it got stiletto damage in a domestic dispute.

138
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,570
哎 女人并不懂艺术 没说错吧?
Well, women don't really get art, do they?

139
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,260
是这样吗?
Is that right?

140
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,820
没错 众所周知
Yeah, well-known fact.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,300
她们对艺术没有耐心
They've got no patience for it.

142
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,660
所以主流艺术家全是男性 女人从来都半途而废
That's why all the major artists are all men. Women would never be able to finish anything.

143
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,300
《微笑骑士》欣赏到一半 
They'd be halfway through The Laughing Cavalier,

144
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,100
她们就走神了 开始分颜色整理鞋柜
then they'd wander off and start colour-coding their shoe cupboard.

145
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,020
听着 我们能回到当前的问题上吗?
Look, can we get back to the matter in hand?

146
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,900
什么问题?
Which was?

147
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
《花园中的小猫》 那幅被偷了的毕加索
A Small Cat In The Garden. The stolen Picasso.

148
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,500
-哦 好  -谁偷的?
-Oh, yeah.  -So who nicked it?

149
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,280
艺术品不是我的菜
Art's not really my thing.

150
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,060
-我说过 是吧?  -是的
-I said that, didn't I?  -Yeah.

151
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,420
-但我听说过它  -什么?
-But I heard about it.  -What?

152
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,280
我说我听说过它
I said I heard about it.

153
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,660
不...不不 你听到什么了?
No...No, no, what did you hear?

154
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,980
-听说它被偷了 来一片吗?  -不用了 谢谢
-That it was nicked. You want a chip?  -No. Thank you.

155
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,780
-有时间约个会吗?  -没有
-Any chance of a date?  -None.

156
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,760
同情的施舍呢? 把它看成慈善工作吧 就一会儿
Sympathy shag? Think of it as charity work, it's been a while.

157
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,380
Cyclops 听着 Mickey有麻烦了
Look, Cyclops, Mickey's in trouble.

158
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,740
不管你知道什么 你都要告诉我
Whatever you know, you need to tell me.

159
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,500
-我们还没讲价呢  -什么?你还要对我们收钱?
-We haven't haggled yet.  -What? You're going to charge us?

160
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
抱歉 我们还在资本主义社会
'Scuse me. This is still a capitalist society.

161
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,300
我以为Mickey是你的朋友
I thought Mickey was your mate.

162
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,420
实际上 他就熟那么一丁点儿
Well, he's more of an acquaintance, really.

163
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,340
不过 我愿意给你们打个折
But that said, I'm willing to make a discount.

164
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,540
要多少?
How much?

165
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,980
你看着给
Call it a nifty.

166
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,300
好
OK.

167
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,620
我不知道它们是否有联系
I can't tell if these things are related,

168
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,940
但毕加索被盗的前一天
but the day before the Picasso was nicked,

169
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,420
飞来壮实的苏格兰佬
a hardcore jock crew flew in.

170
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,620
苏格兰人?
Scottish?

171
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,340
是McCrary兄弟 他们在西桥街借了套房子
The McCrary brothers. They took over a house in Westbridge Grove.

172
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,540
目前 我只知道他们受人的指示行窃
Now, all I know about'em is that they nick to order,

173
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,940
什么都行 通常是高档货
anything you like, usually upmarket.

174
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,420
油画 汽车 古玩...
Paintings, cars, antiques...

175
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,980
我是说 也许他们来这儿是有别的目的 但是...
I mean they could be here for something else, but...

176
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,060
值得怀疑 不是吗?
It's worth asking the question, innit?

177
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,670
好了 你有什么计划?
OK. What do you think?

178
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,020
唔 我们可以敲敲门 说"呀 哎 宝贝"
Well, we could knock on the door, say "Och, aye, the noo,"

179
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,200
然后问问他们是不是刚偷了一幅毕加索
and ask 'em if they've just nicked a Picasso.

180
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,380
真够直接的 但我们都不知道他们的身份
It's direct. But as we don't know who they are,

181
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,350
这样有点冒险
I think it's a little bit foolhardy.

182
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,860
是的 我知道 我就喜欢这样
Yeah, I know, that's what I like about it.

183
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,420
"是谁?"
'Who is it?'

184
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,690
Ash Morgan
It's Ash Morgan,

185
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,900
我要和你谈谈你们刚刚偷到的那幅毕加索
I need to talk to you about the Picasso you just nicked.

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,620
你把脑袋里面是浆糊吗?
Have you lost your marbles?

187
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,780
对啊 我们的时间不多 最坏又能怎么样?
Yeah. We haven't got much time. What's the worst that could happen?

188
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,420
他们会杀了我们!
They could kill us!

189
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,020
哦 那至少 Mickey会知道我们曾拼死相救
Yeah, well, then at least Mickey would know we died trying.

190
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,680
你们还真有胆
You've got some bottle.

191
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,960
对 是啊 我们不得不这样
Yeah, well, needs must, and all of that.

192
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,340
好啊 那你们进来吧
Well, in you come, then.

193
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,840
你真客气 但如果你无所谓的话
That's very kind, but if it's all the same to you,

194
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,350
我们还是呆在这儿吧
we'll stay out here.

195
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:24,780
很公平
Fair play.

196
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,640
事情是这样的
The trouble is,

197
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,100
我的一个好朋友被Petre Sava抓了
a very good friend of mine is being held by Petre Sava,

198
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,120
你就是从那家伙那儿偷的毕加索
the bloke you nicked the Picasso from.

199
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,420
说来话长 但现在他认为是我们偷了画
Now, it's a long story, but now he thinks we got it.

200
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,440
他为什么这么想?
And why would he think that?

201
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,390
因为我们告诉他是我们干的
Because we told him we did.

202
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,220
是的 我们当时想卖一幅赝品给他
Yeah. We were trying to sell him a fake.

203
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,260
我们行骗为生
We're grifters.

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,540
没错 我们是干这行的
Yeah. It's what we do.

205
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,060
我们读到报道说毕加索被偷了
We read about the Picasso being nicked,

206
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,940
所以我们伪造了一幅 卖给一个私人收藏家
so we had a copy made to sell to a private collector,

207
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,540
那人要求不多
one who wouldn't ask too many questions.

208
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,670
如果他们也读到它被偷 就会相信那是真品
If they'd read about it being stolen, they'd believe it was real.

209
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,220
正是这样
Exactly.

210
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,260
问题是 我们卖画的对象正是你偷画的对象
Trouble is, the collector we took it to was the one you'd nicked it from.

211
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,820
你能想象得出他有多生气
Which he wasn't very happy about, as you can imagine.

212
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,280
多感人的故事 我都快热泪盈眶了
It's a beautiful story, and I'm getting all misty-eyed,

213
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,100
但这同我们有什么关系?
but what's this got to do with us?

214
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,270
嗯 额...如果你给我们那幅真的毕加索
Well, err... If you give us the real Picasso,

215
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,500
就是你从Sava那偷来的那幅
the one that you nicked from Sava,

216
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,780
我们就能把我们的朋友救回来了
we can go and get our mate back.

217
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,410
好吧 先假设我们有这幅画
Well, let's just say that we had this painting,

218
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:13,860
我并不是说我们真有 你明白的...
not that I'm saying that we do, you understand...

219
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,870
但他是你们朋友 又不是我们的
But he's your friend, not ours.

220
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,220
所以跟我们有何相干?
So what's in it for us?

221
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,900
额 说实话 我还没好好想过 你想要什么?
Well, to be honest, I haven't thought that bit through. What do you want?

222
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,420
什么都不想要
Don't want anything.

223
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,170
我跟你说
I tell you what,

224
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,060
我可以给你两万美元然后帮你再把画偷回来
20 grand and I'll nick it straight back for you.

225
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,320
要知道 就冲着你这份绝对的厚颜无耻
You know, just for the sheer brass neck of you,

226
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,580
我有兴趣帮你摆脱困境
I'm tempted to help you out.

227
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,340
我最爱骗子了 尤其是漂亮的骗子
And I do love a grifter. Especially a pretty one.

228
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,680
但它已经不在这了
But it's already been moved on.

229
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,380
-去哪了?  -哦 我不能告诉你
-Where?  -Oh, I can't tell you that.

230
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,100
-你必须说  -Ash是吗?  -是的
-You have to.  -Ash, is it?  -Yeah.

231
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,380
Ash
Ash.

232
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,860
我不能说 小崽子
I can't do it, son.

233
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,260
我们辛苦了好些年才建立起的声誉
We've worked years to build up a reputation

234
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,460
靠的是完全的谨慎
based on complete discretion.

235
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,430
我不能为了两个骗子就将它毁了
I can't piss that up the wall for a couple of grifters.

236
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,220
所以我是绝不会讲的
So my lips are sealed.

237
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,560
好吧 如果我威胁要揍你呢?
All right, what about if I threatened to beat it out of you?

238
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,860
我很佩服这样的想法
Then I would respect that.

239
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,380
我和我兄弟Neil会很好地进行自我防卫
And me and my brother Neil here, would defend ourselves as best we could,

240
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,420
我们会把你的脑袋拽下来煮煮吃掉
by ripping your head from the rest of your body and eating it.

241
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,940
很好 我就问问
Fair enough, just asking.

242
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,220
过得愉快
You have a nice day.

243
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,930
看起来我们又回到原点了
So, looks like we're back to square one.

244
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,160
不 不完全是 现在我们知道是谁偷了它
No, not exactly, now we know who stole it.

245
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,540
没错 但不知道他们是为谁偷
Yeah, but not who for.

246
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,170
我们还是不知道它在哪里
We still don't know where it is.

247
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,140
警方那边有什么消息吗 Albert?
Any news from the Old Bill, Albert?

248
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,050
似乎他们知道的还没有我们多
It seems we know more than they do.

249
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,420
要是McCrary兄弟并没有把它交出去呢?
What if the McCrary brothers haven't delivered it yet?

250
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,660
我们可以监视那间屋子 等待他们的行动 对不?
We could just watch the house and wait for them to make a move, right?

251
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,590
要是他们明天或者下周才交货呢?
What if they're delivering it tomorrow or next week?

252
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,980
我们只剩下4小时了
We've only got four hours left.

253
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,460
Petre Sava那边呢?
What about Petre Sava?

254
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,860
对 像你说的 我的确有所发现
Well, I did some digging about, like you said.

255
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,500
Mickey是对的 他是一名高端艺术品收藏家
Mickey was right about him being a high-end art collector.

256
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,540
他的私人收藏能同大多数欧洲美术馆相匹敌
His private collection would rival most European galleries.

257
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,630
我们刚知道 伦敦有六家夜总会归他所有
The last we knew, he owned half a dozen nightclubs in London,

258
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,940
所有他肯定有问题
so he was bound to be a bit dodgy.

259
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,240
嗯 这是件好事
Well, that's a good thing.

260
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,020
没错 尤其是知道有什么问题
Yeah. Until you find out how dodgy.

261
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,840
-贩卖人口...  -啊...
-Human trafficking...  -Aah...

262
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,780
一级毒品销售
Class A drug distribution,

263
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:12,260
还有一个保护费勒索组织 发起于罗马尼亚
and a protection racket that started in Romania,

264
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,700
现在已遍布八个欧洲城市
and has now spread over eight European cities.

265
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,180
我们要把Mickey救出来
We need to get Mickey out of there.

266
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,820
你把那个黑人怎么样了?
So what did you do with the black guy?

267
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,900
他在我的汽车行李箱里
He's in the boot of my car.

268
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,860
-还能呼吸吗?  -当然
-Can he breathe?  -Sure.

269
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,900
至少我觉得能
At least I think so.

270
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,580
如果他们带不回我的画...
If they don't bring me my painting...

271
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,320
..你认为我们是该杀了他
..you think we should kill him,

272
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,660
还是在他身上切下几块?
or just cut some bits off?

273
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,100
或者都干?
Or both?

274
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,940
都干
Both is good.

275
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,940
要知道 在西方可不太切人
They don't cut people up too much in the West, you know.

276
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,620
同样也不太杀人 他们"给点颜色"
They don't kill them very much, either. They "beat up".

277
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,620
但如果你只是"给点颜色" 等他们养好了
But if you just "beat up," they get better,

278
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,540
他们会找些朋友回来报复
they find some friends, and then they come back.

279
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,330
如果你切下几块肉寄给他们的朋友
If you cut bits off and post them to their friends,

280
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,380
这类事就不会发生了
this doesn't happen.

281
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,740
不会 这有效得多
No. It's more efficient.

282
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,260
没错
Exactly.

283
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,580
所以 两件事我们都干
So, both it is.

284
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,660
你切...
You cut...

285
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,380
..我杀
..I kill.

286
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,110
Mickey在哪?
Where's Mickey?

287
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,260
他被一罗马尼亚匪徒绑架了
He's being held hostage by a Romanian gangster

288
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,640
除非我们找到一幅画着花园小猫的画
who won't release him

289
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,620
他是不会放人的
until we find a painting of a cat in a garden.

290
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,940
对 没错 是的
Yeah, right, yeah.

291
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,060
你们这群人可真逗
You crack me up, you lot.

292
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,870
多生动的想象力 像我妈过去常说的那样
Very vivid imaginations, as my mum used to say.

293
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,100
听着 你们的行当里也许需要这个
Mind you, you probably need them in your line of work.

294
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,670
干杯 Eddie
Cheers, Eddie.

295
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,780
听着 给我们几分钟好吗?我们在思考
Look, give us a couple of minutes, will you? We're thinking.

296
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,500
我以为我能听听呢 哦 你有个电话
I thought I could hear something. Oh, you had a phone call.

297
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,670
一位女士...Molly?
Nice lady... Molly?

298
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,060
-Dolly  -Dolly 就是她
-Dolly.  -Dolly. That's it.

299
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,790
她说她知道你们想要什么了
She said she's got what you want,

300
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,540
不过你必须把小可爱送过去 反正就这意思
only you have to send the cute one, whatever that means.

301
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,820
没门
No way.

302
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,900
哦...这不行
Oh... No way.

303
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,860
想都别想!
No way!

304
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,700
不...
No...

305
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,780
..行
..way.

306
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,460
来啦!
Ta-daa!

307
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,340
我不知道你喜欢红酒还是白酒
I didn't know if you liked red or white,

308
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,020
所以都拿来了 噢
so I brought one of each. Oh.

309
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,380
哈哈...
Ha-ha...

310
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,580
好可怕
It was horrible.

311
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,060
-哦 你被迫做了什么?  -我不想说 
-So, did you actually have to? -I don't want to talk about it.

312
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,940
哦...
Oh...

313
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,860
不 当然不用
No, of course not.

314
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,460
她掏出了她的假牙
She took her teeth out.

315
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,980
那么 她究竟说了什么?
So, did she say anything at all?

316
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,060
深呼吸 Sean
Take a deep breath, Sean.

317
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,020
也许有助于你忘掉那些画面
It might help to make the pictures go away.

318
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,550
Petre Sava在肯辛通的一场拍卖会上
Petre Sava bought A Small Cat In The Garden by Picasso

319
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,540
买下了毕加索的《花园里的小猫》
at an auction in Kensington.

320
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,820
他的出价高于一个名为Matthew Fairchild的私人收藏家
He outbid a private collector called Matthew Fairchild,

321
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,700
他是一名投资银行家
who's an investment banker,

322
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,300
恰巧是Louise Fairchild的父亲
and happens to be the father of Louise Fairchild,

323
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,780
结婚改姓前她姓Holmes
whose married name is Holmes.

324
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,860
我们认识吗?
Should we know her?

325
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,300
不 但你们也许听说过她丈夫
No, but you might've heard of her husband.

326
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,180
-Harry Holmes!  -那个Harry Holmes?
-Harry Holmes!  -THE Harry Holmes?

327
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,860
恐怕是的
'Fraid so.

328
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:16,100
没事 没事的 冷静点 冷静
It's all right. It's all right, calm down. Calm down.

329
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,020
现在 我知道你不是软柿子...
Now, I understand you're not a grass...

330
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,660
..我的确很欣赏男人的这种气魄 真的
..and I admire that in a man, I really do.

331
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
我要你自己来切开
I need you to open up for me.

332
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,980
不然...就我来
One way...or another.

333
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,970
当Harry Holmes发现
When Harry Holmes found out

334
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,660
是Petre Sava在油画竞拍中赢了他岳父
it was Petre Sava who beat his father-in-law to the painting,

335
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,940
他很生气 我敢说 这有些伤了他的骄傲
he wasn't happy. It hurt his pride a bit. I bet.

336
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,820
我听说他像狗一样 借着结婚的机会混入了上流社会
I heard he was like a dog with two whatsits when he married into the upper classes.

337
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,310
他向来喜欢对打猎 射击 垂钓
He's always fancied hunting, shooting and fishing.

338
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,980
所以这幅画应该是跟...
So the painting's about impressing

339
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,620
-...他的新岳父们有关?  -看起来是的
-the new in-laws?   -Seems like it.

340
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,820
也可能正是因为他们 Harry自己才能一指不动
Then maybe those in-laws are one of the reasons that Harry hasn't got his own hands dirty

341
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,860
就把画拿了回来
in order to get the painting back.

342
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,100
他雇了麦氏兄弟去帮他偷画
He paid the McCrary brothers to steal it for him instead.

343
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,850
Dolly就是这么说的
That's what Dolly said.

344
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,380
那你确定这不是枕边风?
And you're sure that wasn't just pillow talk?

345
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,140
所以一边是凶残的欧洲黑帮 另一边是杀人狂?
So on one side we've got a violent Eastern European gangster, and on the other, a homicidal maniac?

346
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,700
-主要看我们够不够强硬了  -那我们该怎么办?
-That's about the strength of it.  -So what shall we do?

347
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,260
直觉告诉我应该给老Bill打个电话
Sensible thing would be call the Old Bill,

348
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,540
告诉他事情原委 然后让他罩着我们
tell 'em what happened and throw ourselves on their mercy.

349
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,500
但我们不会这么做的 对吧?
We're not going to do that, right?

350
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,460
当然不会 那我们只有用另一个法子了
No. Which leaves us with one other option.

351
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,380
那就是?
Which is?

352
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:28,580
把画从Harry Holmes那儿偷回来
To steal the painting back from Harry Holmes.

353
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,860
这是Matthew Fairchild的家
This is the home of Matthew Fairchild,

354
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,540
Harry Holmes的岳父
father-in-law of Harry Holmes,

355
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:16,860
也就是付钱雇麦氏兄弟去偷Petre Sava的画的人
who paid the McCrery brothers to steal the Picasso Painting from Petre Sava.

356
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,580
我还是不敢相信你居然把它拿回来了
I still can't believe you got it back.

357
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,940
都是一家人 别见外
It's family, innit?

358
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,540
我看有的人等会儿可有福了喔
I know someone who's getting a special treat later.

359
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,940
Fairchild算是个藏家了 
Now Fairchild's already a collector,

360
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,380
所以安保方面比较到位
so the security is a bit nifty.

361
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,590
真是个好消息
That's comforting.

362
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,030
他装了中央监控 重力感应板 动作捕捉器
CCTV, weight sensor pads, motion detectors,

363
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,500
热量侦测系统和激光防盗网
heat imaging systems and laser webs.

364
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,580
但是这些都得等你先放倒门口的两条大狼狗再说
That's if you can get past the two killer dogs in the grounds.

365
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,300
我最讨厌狗了
I hate dogs.

366
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,420
幸运的是 这套针对艺术品的安保系统
Luckily, although the system's state of the art,

367
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,540
完全是Fairchild自己设计的
it was designed by Fairchild himself.

368
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,180
这对我们有帮助吗?
How does that help us?

369
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,630
这种系统也就是从设计上看看还行
Systems like this are only as good as their design,

370
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,780
实际上他犯了一个很低级的错误
and he's made a very common, but simple mistake.

371
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,870
什么错误?
Which is?

372
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,950
本质上来说这是一个家用的监控系统
Basically it's a domestic system,

373
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,420
那跟别的家用警报系统一样
and like most domestic alarm systems,

374
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,380
它主要是为了小偷防止入室行窃而设计的
it's designed on the assumption that a theft would take place

375
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,780
那它要么是在家里没人的时候
either when the place is empty

376
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,180
要么是在月黑风高的夜里才启动
or at night under cover of darkness.

377
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,740
也就是说大白天有人在家的时候 警报是关掉的
Which means when they're home during the day, the alarms are switched off.

378
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,200
没错啊
Exactly.

379
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,780
谁会笨到偏偏选光天化日之下 大家都在家的时候
Because who would be stupid enough to break into a house

380
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,460
堂而皇之地破门而入呢?
in broad daylight when everyone's at home?

381
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,980
'所以 只要时机选对了就万事OK
'OK, so this is all about timing.

382
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,300
'万事俱备 好戏开场
'Everything on cue, like a ballet.

383
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,580
'首先 要确定狗已服用安眠药
'Firstly, let's make sure the dogs get their sleeping pills.

384
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,220
'大概有20分钟的药效
'They'll last about 20 minutes.'

385
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,340
三...二...一!
Three, two, one.

386
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,260
'狗睡着了 我这就就位'
'Dogs are asleep. I'm moving into position.'

387
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,660
Albert 准备好了?
Albert, you set?

388
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,860
准备好了
Ready.

389
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,700
Emma Sean 好了吗?
Emma? Sean?

390
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,580
准备好了
Ready.

391
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,420
-准备好了  -'很好'
-Ready.  -'OK.'

392
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,220
出发!
Go!

393
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,020
女士您好 我们是来调查油画失窃案的
Hello, madam. We're investigating a stolen painting.

394
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,380
-你想干嘛?  -例行搜查
-What are you doing?  -We need to search the property.

395
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,660
怎么回事?
What's going on?

396
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,620
不知道啊
I don't know.

397
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,620
好啊!我记住你工号了!我要去警局投诉你!
I've got your number, fella! I'll be straight onto the station!

398
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,500
我觉得我们最好还是走吧
But I think we should get out of here.

399
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,140
好 我跟你一起走
Yeah. I'm with you.

400
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,780
别急 看!
No, look!

401
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,180
好好好!我特么受够了!
This is it, I've had enough!

402
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,140
很好 准备行动
All right, come on.

403
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,500
冷静一下 别激动
Calm down.

404
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,380
你让我怎么特么冷静!
Don't you tell me to calm down!

405
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,460
好的好的 谢了 Nigel 我还欠你一根雪茄呢
All right, thanks, Nigel, don't forget I owe you a big cigar.

406
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,420
你只要好货?没问题 谢了 再见
A good one? Yeah, thanks, bye, bye.

407
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,900
有人把风声走漏给了警方
All right, the police have been tipped off,

408
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,220
现在警察拿走了画逮捕了Harry Holmes
they've seized the painting and they've arrested Harry Holmes.

409
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,670
现在局面是好是坏呢?
Is that good or bad?

410
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,240
这个么 不能说好 是吧?
Well, it can't be good, can it?

411
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,180
等一下!这就对了呀
Wait! That's exactly what it is.

412
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,060
怎么会?
How?

413
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,480
如果警察拿着画 这画本来就是Sava的
If the police have it, Sava was the rightful owner.

414
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,580
警方就会把画还给他呀
They'll give him back the painting.

415
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,390
他会让Micky去的 这不结了么!
He'll let Mickey go. Job done.

416
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,740
Eduardo 拿点儿吃的来
Eduardo, refreshments, please.

417
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,580
你好?
Hello?

418
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,660
是我 Nigel!
Yes, Nigel!

419
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:47,940
好 我知道了 谢谢你的回电 非常感谢
I see. All right, thanks for taking the time to call me back, I appreciate it.

420
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,640
他们把Harry Holmes放了
They've released Harry Holmes.

421
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,420
这也太快了吧!
That was quick!

422
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,460
他们在他家找到的画是幅赝品
Well, they found the painting in the house and it was fake.

423
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,460
搞什么飞机?!这不可能啊 我们知道那是真画啊
What?! That ain't possible. We know it was the original,

424
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,060
明明是他从Sava那儿偷来的
he had it nicked from Sava,

425
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,460
Sava从拍卖会买来的画嘛
who bought it at the auction.

426
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,370
要是赝品被盗 
He wouldn't have kidnapped Mickey

427
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,260
他也不至于绑架Micky 再把Ash倒吊起来啊
and hung Ash upside down if he'd lost a fake!

428
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,900
那如果Harry手上是赝品的话 真画在哪儿呢?
So if the one Harry had was a fake, where's the real one?

429
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,380
饮料来了
Drinks up.

430
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,780
-喔 谢谢你 Eddie  -乐意效劳...
-Oh, thank you very much, Eddie.  -It's a pleasure to serve you...

431
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,740
嗯 非常感谢!
Yeah, thank you very much!

432
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,100
这样根本说不通嘛 嗯 我们再好好想想
Doesn't make sense. No. Let's think about this for a minute.

433
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,450
我们必须先假设...
We have to assume that...

434
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,900
麦氏兄弟从Patre Sava手上偷到的是真品
the painting the McCrary brothers nicked from Petre Sava is the real Picasso.

435
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,620
对的
Agreed.

436
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,300
但是在送到Harry Holmes和他岳父手上的时候
But by the time it got to Harry Holmes and his father-in-law,

437
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,820
被人掉包了
it was a fake.

438
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,750
-一点儿没错  -那是谁做的手脚呢?
-Exactly.  -So they switched it?

439
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,580
肯定是这样子
Can't be anything else.

440
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,060
那如果他们给到Harry的是赝品
So if they passed on a fake to Harry,

441
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,680
他们也没有别的买主要买真画 混账东西
they must've had another buyer for the real one. Robbing bastards.

442
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,660
所以麦氏兄弟拿着真画咯?
The McCrarys have the real painting?

443
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,270
这是唯一说得通的解释了
That's the only thing that makes sense.

444
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,450
画肯定在他们手上
They must!

445
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,740
或者至少他们知道画在哪儿
Or at least know where it is.

446
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,140
-门户大开啊  -呃 我们来晚了!
-The gate's wide open.  -Oh, we're too late!

447
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,300
里里外外连个人影都看不到...
There's no sign of life anywhere...

448
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,310
当然 他们早跑路了
No, they're long gone.

449
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,730
还用说么
Well, of Course.

450
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,020
如果你想好了在Harry Holmes眼皮底下偷梁换柱
If you're just about to stitch up Harry Holmes,

451
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,280
难道你还原地不动等着被抓啊
you're not gonna hang around where he can find you.

452
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,540
我们上次见过面以后他们肯定就搬走了
They must have moved out just after we saw them.

453
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,400
他们现在可能都已经回格拉斯哥了
They could be back in Glasgow by now.

454
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,180
-我们死定了  -是Micky死定了才对
-We're screwed.  -You mean Mickey is.

455
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,600
等等
Wait, wait.

456
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,900
如果要把赝品掉包给Harry Holmes的话
If you were going to give Harry Holmes a fake,

457
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,540
肯定不能让他起疑心
you're not going to risk him spotting it.

458
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,180
所以这个赝品必须要真的能以假乱真才行
It'd have to be near-perfect.

459
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,340
那么 到哪儿能搞到足够以假乱真的毕加索的画呢?
So - where would you go for a near-perfect copy of a Picasso?

460
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,810
人家也要穿衣吃饭的啊!
A girl's got to earn a living!

461
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,140
但是你为什么不告诉我们呢 Dolly?
But why didn't you tell us, Dolly?

462
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,500
因为我根本不知道这两件事有关联啊!
Well, I didn't know there was a connection!

463
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,060
显而易见的事情嘛 这幅画不就是我问你的那幅嘛
It's the flaming cat in the wotsit, the painting we was asking you about!

464
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,690
话是这么说 但是我又不可能事事都上心
Yeah, but I can't keep track of everything,

465
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,500
我又不是会计 我是艺术家啊
I'm not an accountant, I'm an artist.

466
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,260
罢了罢了 一步步来 好不好?
All right, all right. So...step by step, right?

467
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,940
麦氏兄弟手上的赝品是你画的对吧?
You did the fake for the McCrarys, right?

468
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,900
-有这种可能吧  -Dolly! 别打岔!
-Maybe.  -Dolly! Stop messing about!

469
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,260
你就让他这样子跟我说话啊?
Are you going to let him speak to me like that?

470
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,460
啊?
Eh?

471
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,580
我还以为我们之间是有感情的呢
I thought what we had was special.

472
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,540
我们之间什么也没有好么!
We didn't have anything!

473
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,020
你都摸过我的Mabel了!
You touched my Mabel!

474
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,220
什么玩意儿?
What?

475
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,020
那个那个 那个是她养的雪貂而已
That-That is what she calls her ferret.

476
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,700
-雪貂?  -对啊 她在卡其布里面养的
-Ferret?  -She keeps it in the khazi.

477
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,020
我才不会随便让人碰我的Mabel呢
I don't let just anyone touch my Mabel.

478
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,060
Dolly!
Dolly!

479
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,860
哎哟 好吧好吧
Yeah, yeah, all right, all right.

480
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,100
我是给麦氏兄弟画了一幅赝品
I made the McCrarys a fake,

481
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,860
他们说他们有个买家 但是个外行
and they said that they'd got a buyer, but he was a muppet

482
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,820
他们说那人根本不识货
and he'd never know the difference.

483
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,900
是是是 那个"外行"就是Harry Holmes
Yeah, well, that "muppet" is Harry Holmes.

484
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,180
呃 这事大了
Oh. That's not good.

485
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,380
是吧 你也知道大事不妙了?我现在要你告诉我
No, it's not, is it? So I need you to tell me

486
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,220
麦氏兄弟到底把真品弄到哪儿去了
what the McCrarys were doing with the real Picasso.

487
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,260
他们当时是说了点儿关于新买家的事情
They did say something about a new buyer.

488
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,340
是谁?
Who?

489
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,500
我不知道啊
I don't know.

490
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,730
他们到底说了些什么?提到了什么名字了吗?
Did they say anything at all? Mention any names?

491
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:44,980
没有
No.

492
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,100
罢了罢了 呃 那这幅赝品...
OK, right, well, the, er, the fake...

493
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,980
那你画完了以后 是他们亲自来你这儿取的?
so, when you'd finished it, did they collect it from here?

494
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,580
-这倒没有  -那是怎么交易的呢?
-No.  -So how did you get it to them?

495
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,300
我把画包好叫出租车送走的
I had to parcel it up and send it in a cab.

496
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,020
很好 画被送到哪儿去了呢?
Right. Where to?

497
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,780
我记不得了呀
I don't remember.

498
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,340
Dolly!这点很关键的啊!
Dolly! This is important.

499
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:06,380
你们想想看 我压力山大啊!
Look, it's all this pressure!

500
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,580
你们一个个直勾勾盯着我 我根本没法正常思考!
I can't think straight with you all looking at me!

501
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,060
-那我们不看你总行了吧?  -可以,除了他
-Would it help if we all just looked away?  -Yes. Except him.

502
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,620
哦 Dolly你就省省吧
Oh, come on, Dolly!

503
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,300
噢...噢!
Oh. Oh!

504
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,940
一点杜松子酒能让我醒醒脑
Maybe a gin might do it.

505
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,340
能让我放松点儿
It helps me to relax.

506
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,780
还有什么线索?
What do we have with it?

507
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,940
再来点儿
More gin.

508
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,780
-给她吧  -谢谢
-Go.  -Thank you.

509
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,020
画是送去一家酒店的
It was a hotel.

510
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,580
很好 哪家?
Good. Which one?

511
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,420
在城西的一家酒店
Up west.

512
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,100
酒店名字?
Name.

513
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,340
再来一杯
Have another gin.

514
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,780
再喝下去她醉倒了我们问谁去?
She's no use to us if she passes out, is she?

515
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,420
我不是好好的吗 你急什么!
I am here, you know!

516
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,580
我想...
I could, er...

517
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,780
我可以在那边给我们开个房间...
I could book us a room while I was there.

518
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,100
叫Goodridge 在泰晤士河南岸那一带
It was the Goodridge on the South Bank.

519
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,540
帮我看看他们有没有四柱床哦!
See if they've got a four-poster!

520
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,940
他还活着吗?
Is he still alive?

521
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,940
活着 老板
Yes, boss.

522
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,540
你的朋友们只剩两个小时了
You know your friends have two hours to return with my painting.

523
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,080
如果他们来迟了
If they are late,

524
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,540
每过十分钟我就切掉你身体的一部分 直到他们出现
we cut off something every ten minutes until they get here.

525
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,420
如果再过两个小时他们还不来的话
If they are not here in two hours,

526
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,020
你就是个死虾子了
we kill whatever is left.

527
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,780
你觉得怎么样?
What do you think of that?

528
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,180
要不要我把他嘴上封条揭下来 让他说说他的想法?
Do you want me to take his gag off? So he can tell you what he thinks?

529
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,420
不用不用
No, no.

530
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,100
我很善于与人打交道的 这不过是个反问罢了
I'm a people person, it was a rhetorical question,

531
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,740
我知道他怎么想的
I know what he thinks.

532
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,780
你真知道?
You do?

533
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,380
他在想啊 要是他们能按时赶到就好了
He is thinking he hopes his friends come before we cut anything off.

534
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,940
哦
Oh.

535
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,740
也有可能他在想
Then maybe he's thinking about

536
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,580
我们会按什么顺序从哪儿开始切他呢?
what we will cut off, and in what order.

537
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,220
是吧?
True?

538
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,650
你说他们还在这儿吗?
Do you think they're still here?

539
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,450
Albert, 这个前台你认不认识?
Albert, do you know the concierge?

540
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,740
认识 他叫Anthony...
Yes. Anthony...

541
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,700
等我一下
Excuse me a moment.

542
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,120
Dolly把赝品寄到这儿来了
I thought Dolly sent the fake painting here.

543
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,580
当然了 是麦氏兄弟要的呀
Yes, the McCrary brothers needed a fake

544
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,730
把假的给Harry Holmes 而不是真的
to give to Harry Holmes, not the real one.

545
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:53,900
所以说真画有可能还在这儿咯?
So the real one could be here?

546
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,660
只有一个办法能弄清楚了
There's only one way to find out.

547
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,820
好了 他们今晚在这儿住
All right. They're staying overnight,

548
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,940
已经定好了明早去机场的车
they've booked a car tomorrow morning to go to the airport.

549
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,980
现在他们正在酒吧喝酒呢
And right now, they're in the bar.

550
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,500
他们看起来好像没带东西嘛
They don't look like they've got anything with them.

551
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
-他们住哪间房 Albert?  -624
-What room are they in, Albert?  -624.

552
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,940
他们见过我和Ems 所以我们上去检查房间
They've seen me and Ems, so we'll check the room,

553
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,980
-你盯住他们 如果他们要走提前告诉我  -好嘞
-you keep an eye on 'em, give us a heads up if they move.  -All right.

554
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,260
-我们时间不多  -你从那边找  -好
-We haven't got a lot of time.  -You go that way.  -Yeah.

555
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,460
不在这儿
It's not here.

556
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,180
是我搞砸了 对吧?
I'm making a real pig's ear of this, aren't I?

557
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,660
每次都是Micky把我们弄出来的
All those times Mickey's bailed us out,

558
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,420
我却连一幅画都找不到
I can't even find a painting.

559
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,060
我们会找到了 时间问题罢了
We'll find it, it's just a matter of time.

560
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,620
我们没时间了啊 只剩一个小时不到了
Time we haven't got. It's less than an hour now.

561
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,710
现在怎么办?
Know what?

562
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,540
我还不如全副武装的去Sava家试试看
I'd rather get tooled up, go to Sava's and take me chances.

563
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,850
你不能那么做
You can't do that.

564
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,820
好吧 但是现在这个我也做不来啊
Yeah, well, I can't do this either.

565
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,350
失败是成功之母嘛 加把油
It's a setback, but come on,

566
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,780
你跟Micky一样厉害的
you're just as smart as Mickey.

567
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,180
对 麦氏兄弟还在楼下呢
Right. The McCrary brothers are still downstairs.

568
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,260
我们再下去找他们谈谈
Let's just go and try to talk to them again.

569
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,060
我们会成功的 走吧!
We can get through this. Let's go.

570
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,940
嗯 这就对了
Now, that's clever.

571
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,940
看吧 我就说我们能成功的
See? I told you we'd get it!

572
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,940
你们特么是谁?
Who the hell are you?

573
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,660
我来帮你们捋捋清楚
So let me get this straight.

574
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,850
Sava扣住了你们的同伴 让你们把画还给他
Sava is holding your mate until you bring him this.

575
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:36,980
对
Yeah.

576
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,180
他不知道是我把画偷走了 他以为是你偷的?
And he doesn't know it was me who nicked the painting? He thinks it was you.

577
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,740
这回你可真是阴沟里翻船了啊 宝贝儿
Sounds like you're up shit creek and left the paddle at home, sunshine.

578
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,620
我算是修成了正果了
And I have had a right result.

579
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,700
就告诉我一件事
Just tell me one thing.

580
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,780
你们怎么知道画在这儿?
How did you know it was here?

581
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,600
我们不知道啊
We didn't.

582
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,060
我们只是找到麦氏兄弟 然后顺藤摸瓜放手一搏
We just found the McCrarys and hoped for the best.

583
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,380
是 那俩孙子可是把我耍的团团转啊
Yeah, well those two stitched me right up.

584
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,660
要只是卖幅假画给我也就罢了
Didn't just sell me a moody painting,

585
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,180
他们让我在我老婆的家人面前丢多大人啊
they made me look like a prat in front of my wife's family.

586
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,220
他们人呢?
Where are they?

587
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,140
不知道啊 我们进来的时候没人
No idea, there was no-one in the room when we got here.

588
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,740
好 看起来你们并没有碍我的事 我对你们也无所求
All right, seems to me you two haven't done me any harm, you've got nothing I need,

589
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,380
你们的烦心事儿已经够多了 出去吧
and you've got enough to worry about. So get out.

590
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,420
在我没改主意之前快滚吧
Go on, sling your hook before I change my mind.

591
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,580
我们不能就这么一走了之
We can't do that.

592
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,540
-是么?  -是的
-Oh, yeah?  -No.

593
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,530
没有这幅画的话
Without the painting,

594
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,780
Petre Sava不会放了我朋友的
Petre Sava's not gonna let our mate go.

595
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,660
所以我不管你是谁
So, I don't care who you are.

596
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,660
没有拿到画我是不会走的
I ain't leaving without it.

597
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,380
这就是你的下限?
And that's your final word?

598
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,220
没错
Yeah, it is.

599
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,820
别这样!
No, don't!

600
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,860
喔...
Oohh...

601
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:03,620
Ash 这可不是明智之举啊
Ash. That wasn't very smart.

602
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,780
我们有备选方案吗?
So have we got a plan B?

603
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,060
-只是方案一的修正版罢了  -是啊?
-Well, it's more like plan A revisited.  -Eh?

604
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,790
Harry肯定会带着画回家找他岳父邀功请赏的
Harry will take the painting back to his father-in-law's like a hero.

605
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,260
而且我们之前已经有一个方案了
And we've got a plan

606
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,200
-就是上他家偷画  -聪明!
-to steal it back from there.  -Clever.

607
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,060
就是啊!但更重要的是Harry必须马上到家才行
Yeah, more importantly, we need Harry back at the house pronto,

608
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,180
而他要去找麦氏兄弟的话肯定会耽搁
and finding the McCrary boys will only slow him down.

609
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,020
我们要确保他现在就走
So let's make sure he has to leave now.

610
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,060
对
Right.

611
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,220
好戏上演 记得么?
Like a ballet, remember?

612
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,860
-各就各位了?  -是
-We all set?  -Ready.

613
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,820
就位
Set.

614
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,420
我准备好了
I'm ready.

615
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,660
好了
Right.

616
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,780
出发!
Go!

617
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,620
你确定这次的是真品没错?
And you're sure it's definitely the real one this time?

618
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,780
-当然  -爱死你了 我都等不及了
-Oh, yeah.  -Ooh, I love you so much, I could burst.

619
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,660
我来开
I'll get it.

620
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,860
哪位?
Hello?

621
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,940
你好 不好意思
Hi, I'm really sorry,

622
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,260
我们家Bobby刚跑到你院子里去了
but my Bobby has just run into your garden.

623
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,660
-Bobby?  -哦 是一只白色的比熊
-Bobby?  -He's a white Bichon Frise.

624
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,580
-喔  -我就是怕你家也养狗了  -我家养狗
-Oh.  -Only I was worried in case you had dogs.  -We do!

625
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,340
哦
Oh.

626
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,100
不是吧 嗯...
No. Um...

627
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,860
Bobby!宝贝儿 出来出来
Bobby! Darling, come on!

628
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,420

Wait, I'll come with you.

629
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,860
好 两个人在客厅
OK, two in the viewing room.

630
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,660
是时候把他们分开了
'Time to split 'em up.'

631
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,500

'上个月在伦敦也见过面'
'and greet in London last month.'

636
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,140
你不记得我啦?
You do remember?

637
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,860
这边我们已经找了两次了
We've been through here twice before.

638
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:57,260
它可能就在这堆树丛里 Bobby!
He could be under any of these bushes. Bobby!

639
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,980
好了 Ash 只剩一个了
OK, Ash, one left over.

640

'这让我回到我的另一个观点...'
'Which brings me to my other point...'

646
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,220
是的 当然 我很有兴趣...

649
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,980

658
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,220
'我们可以做出一些规划...'
'and I can draw out some projections...'

659
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,670
对不起Mattew 参议员在另外一条线上
Sorry, Matthew, I got the Senator on the other line,

660
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,500

662

回家 James 别心疼你的马!
Home, James, and don't spare the horses!

663
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,780
你不会相信我在花园在干什么
You won't believe what I've been doing in the garden.

664
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,060
我一直在追...
I've been chasing...

665
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,100
噢 不会吧
Oh, no.

666
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,340
是的 我拿到了 是的 真的那幅

The same place as you left me in half an hour.

668
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,140
但是如果Mickey不在那儿 
But if Mickey's not there,

669
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,420
这桩买卖就谈不成了...
the deal's off...

670
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:50,620
好吧
OK.

671

半个小时
Half hour.

672
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,620
好吧 都搞定了 半小时后在仓库见
Well? All set. We'll meet back at the warehouse in half an hour.

673
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,660
我们交给他们真画 
We give 'em the real painting,

674
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,180
他们把Mickey还给我们
they give us Mickey.

675
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,900
但我们能相信他们吗?
But can we trust them?

676
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,620
老实讲 Albert 我不知道
The honest truth is, Albert, I don't know.

677
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,620
如果Harry猜到是我们
What if Harry realises it was us?

678
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,620
-这个我也不知道  -如果...?
-I don't know that either.  -What happens if...

679
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,630
我们先把Mickey救回来
Let's get Mickey back first,

680
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,500
再担心其他的事情 好不好?
and worry about everything else later, yeah?

681
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,260
这个计划可行
Sounds like a plan.

682
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,940
好吧 首先我得先喝一杯
Yeah, well, first, I need a drink.

683
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:18,700
拿酒来
Set 'em up.

684
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,900
你们来了!
There you are!

685
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,460
疯子Dolly告诉我们在哪里能找到你们
Mad Dolly told us where to find you.

686
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,620
哦?
Oh?

687
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,140
在宾馆里的是你吧 是不是?
That was you at the hotel, wasn't it?

688
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,220
宾馆?
Hotel?

689
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,260
我看见你离开的
I saw you leaving.

690
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,740
你们是正好经过吗?
Just passing, were you?

691
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,220
没错 是的 我们 额...
That's right, yeah, we erm...

692
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:47,460
我们知道了你们在哪里
Well, we found out where you were

693
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:51,580
我们想再试一次 你懂得 试图说服你们...
and we thought we'd try again, you know, to convince you to...

694
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,140
让我们把画带走
let us take the painting.

695
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,340
我也是这么想的
That's what I thought.

696
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,100
也就是说是你们触响了警铃 是不是?
So it was you guys that set off the alarm, was it?

697
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,520
是啊 是 我们...
Yeah, yeah, we...

698
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,540
我跟你们说的没错吧?
What did I tell you?

699
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,500
所以我们到这来 想要谢谢你们的!
That's why we're here, we wanted to say thank you!

700
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,620
哦?
Eh?

701
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,700
听着 我不知道你们为什么要那么做 去触发警铃
Look, I don't know why you hit the alarm when you did,

702
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,350
但是如果你们没那么做的话
but if you hadn't,

703
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,300
我们就还在那里得意
we'd have just waltzed up there

704
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,020
而Harry Holmes在我们房里
and found Harry Holmes in our room.

705
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,420
噢 是的 不要客气 
Yeah, well, you know, don't mention it.

706
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,020
到底发生了什么事?
So what happened?

707
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,100
你找到了我们
You found us

708
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:30,500
然后看见Harry和他那伙人也在那 对不对?
and then you saw Harry and his goons there too, right?

709
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,910
对的 是 于是... 我们就赶快逃走
That's right, yeah. So...we legged it.

710
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,780
但是我们不想丢下你们不管...
Only we didn't want to drop you in it, so...

711
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,660
所以就触动了警铃
So we hit the alarm.

712
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,740
我只知道要不是你们 我们就完蛋了
Look. All I know is if it wasn't for you guys we would be screwed.

713
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,900
所以 真的很感谢你们
So, thank you.

714
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,340
别客气 我希望你们也会为我们这么做
It's a pleasure, I hope you'd do the same for us.

715
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,660
噢 那当然!
Oh, absolutely!

716
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:48,860
好吧 这边请
Well, there you go.

717
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,780
我们很想留下来跟你们一起喝杯啤酒
We'd love to stay and have a beer with you,

718
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,500
但是我们要去赶飞机
but we have a flight to catch.

719
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,540
我们要回家 开始花这笔钱了
We've got to get home and make a start on spending this.

720
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,660
四十万... 这幅画
400 grand...for the painting.

721
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,820
画?
The painting?

722
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,220
毕加索的
The Picasso.

723
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,740
我们卖给Harry一幅Dolly的伪造品
We sold Harry one of the duds Dolly made.

724
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,410
是啊 我听说了 所以他在找你们
Yeah, I heard. That's why he was looking for you.

725
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:16,260
哦 那还用说
Oh, no doubt.

726
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,070
但是我们还有另外一个买主等候买一幅真品
But we also had another buyer lined up for the real one.

727
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,780
一个德国佬
German guy.

728
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,040
等一下
Wait.

729
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,140
你说你将"其中一幅赝品"卖给Harry?
You said you sold "one of the duds" to Harry?

730
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:34,540
你还卖了一幅伪造品给德国人?
So you sold a dud to the German too?

731
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:40,380
不是的 他拿到的是真品 他出价最高的
No, no, he got the real thing. Bid the highest you see.

732
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,790
不是 我们让Dolly画了两幅赝品
No, we had Dolly make two duds.

733
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:44,540
其中的一幅卖给了Harry
We sold one to Harry,

734
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:48,020
另外一幅我们准备卖给一个在宾馆酒吧的澳洲家伙
and the other we were going to sell to some Aussie guy in the hotel bar,

735
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:48,940
可是他没出现
but he was a no show.

736
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,740
是吗 但是你不可能已经把真的卖掉了
Yeah, yeah, but you can't have sold the real one,

737
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,820
因为Harry发现它在你们的房间里
because Harry found it in your room.

738
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:57,700
那他回到家肯定要大失所望了
He would have been pretty disappointed when he got home.

739
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,420
-呃?  -我们今天下午就跟这个德国家伙成交了
Eh? Did the deal with the German guy this afternoon,

740
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,260
比Harry找到我们要早很多
long before Harry found us.

741
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,100
如果他在我们房间里看到那幅画 那是另一幅仿造品
If he found a painting in our room, it was the other dud.

742
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,500
糟了 我想起来我们把它挂墙上了
Shit, I think we actually hung it up on the wall.

743
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,300
我们把它留在那儿 当做给宾馆的一点小礼物
We were leaving it as a wee present for the hotel.

744
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:15,180
听着 我说过了 我们来就是要谢谢你们
Look, like I said, we just came here to say thank you.

745
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:22,940
哦 顺便问一下 你们朋友的事情进行的怎么样?
Oh, by the way, how did, er... How did things pan out with your friend?

746
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,820
噢 我们... 我们还在进行当中
Oh, well, we're, er...We're still working on it.

747
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,940
好吧 祝你们顺利
Well, good luck with that.

748
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,500
加油
Cheers.

749
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:41,260
就是说 我们偷了另一幅赝品?
So we stole another fake?

750
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,970
你告诉Sava我们有半小时
You told Sava we had half an hour.

751
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,500
我们只有十五分钟了
We've got 15 minutes.

752
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,860
现在怎么办?
So what do we do now?

753
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,420
给你 伙计
Here you are, mate.

754
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,380
当你置身于法律之外 游走在社会边缘
When you live outside the law, on the fringes of society,

755
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,100
你总是会碰到这样的日子
you're always going to have days like this.

756
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:32,820
你称之为办公室里糟糕的一天
What you might call a bad day in the office.

757
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,500
最重要的是不要慌
Well, the thing is not to panic.

758
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,020
因为那种人 像猎狗一样 
Because people like this lot, they're like dogs,

759
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,860
他们能嗅到恐惧
they can smell fear.

760
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,500
所以对策就是让他们以为 你知道些他们不知道的事
So the trick is to make them think you know something they don't.

761
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,820
这样一来在他们还没搞清楚怎么回事之前
That way they'll generally hold off killing you

762
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,100
他们就不会急着杀了你
while they try and work out what it is.

763
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:10,220
画带来了吗?
You have brought my painting?

764
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,180
-你把我的朋友带来了吗?  -先看画
-You brought my friend?  -Painting first.

765
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,390
先把朋友交给我们 否则没什么好谈的
Friend first or there's no deal.

766
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,500
我想你们这种处境没资格讨价还价 是不是?
I don't think you're in a position to negotiate, do you?

767
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,700
如果你这么认为 那你就大错特错了
If you believe that, it could be the worst mistake you ever made.

768
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:24,620
我见我的朋友...然后你看你的画
I see my friend...you see your painting.

769
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:48,740
轮到你了
Now your turn.

770
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,380
好吧 我的画在哪里?
Right. Who's got my painting?

771
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:23,420
这不关你的事 Harry
This is none of your business, Harry.

772
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:25,220
那我就让它关我的事 Boris
Well, I'm making it my business, Boris,

773
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:27,820
这么久以来 我一直围着你团团转
I've been dancing around you lot for too long.

774
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,620
我不叫Boris
My name is not Boris.

775
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,300
我说你是你就是
It is when I'm talking to you.

776
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,980
你知道 叫我Boris是一种种族歧视
You know, calling me Boris is racist.

777
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,180
算你倒霉
Tough.

778
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,340
呃... 对不起 我们可以继续我们的事吗?
Er, excuse me, can we, er...Can we get on with this, please?

779
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,200
这儿有你什么事儿?
What are you doing here?

780
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,060
你以为我干嘛来这儿出风头?
What do you think I'm flaming doing here?

781
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:44,940
我是来交易这幅画的...
I've come to swap this painting...

782
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,460
替同伴来的
for my mate.

783
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,020
-这是我的画  -非也 是我的才对
-That is my painting.  -No. My painting.

784
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,020
-我正大光明搞来的  -现在我要拿回来
-I nicked it, fair and square.  -And now I'm getting it back.

785
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:54,660
有完没完!
That's enough!

786
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,740
-你丫吼谁呢?  -吼你!
-Who you shouting at? You!

787
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:01,420
你们俩！
The pair of you!

788
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,860
你们有听说过什么叫盗亦有道吗?
Have you never heard of honour amongst thieves?

789
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,820
你们同行间没有过点头称赞的欣赏吗?
Some kind of nodding appreciation amongst your peers?

790
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,260
你们还没断奶啊
You're like a couple of five-year-olds.

791
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:19,420
"小姐 拜托了 他抢我的画" 多可悲
"Please, Miss, he's nicked my painting." It's pathetic.

792
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,980
-我受够你们俩了!  -拿画呀
-And I've had it with both of you!  -Get the painting.

793
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,500
啊 啊 啊!
Ah, ah, ah!

794
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,350
子弹曾刷刷的从我眼前飞过
I've had a gun shoved up me hooter,

795
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:36,740
我还被倒吊起来
been hung upside down

796
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:38,500
还被踢到半空去过
and kicked up in the air.

797
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,340
我跑遍半个伦敦的途中 被3个国籍的势力威胁过
I've been threatened by at least three nationalities

798
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,140
就为了这幅破画 画的是某个后院里有只小猫
while running around half of London chasing some stupid picture of a cat in someone's back garden

799
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:52,100
看上去就像个糖吃多了的3岁小孩的信手涂鸦
that looks like it was done by a three-year-old on a sugar rush.

800
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:57,660
我被骗过 蒙过 还被老是被骂
I've been lied to, cheated and generally abused

801
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,940
就是因为我和这几个同伴想要赚个童叟无欺的名声
just because me and my mate here were trying to earn an honest crust

802
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,380
而这个Rasputin却神经到绑架了他
when Rasputin here went and kidnapped him.

803
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:06,770
喂 Rasputin还不如Boris好呢
Hey. Rasputin is worse than Boris.

804
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:07,700
我说了 闭嘴!
I said, shut it!

805
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,700
现在我不知道谁画该给谁了 说实话
Now, I don't know whose painting this is and, to be quite honest,I don't give a flying toss!

806
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,360
我今天过得很糟糕!
I've had a very bad day!

807
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,780
你知道你在和谁说话么?
Do you know who you're talking to?

808
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,700
管他是谁
Never mind who I'm talking to.

809
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:25,560
你该担心的是我们是什么人物 小子
You ought to worry about who we are, son.

810
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,220
咱是骗子 哦耶
We're grifters. Yeah.

811
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,020
站这的这家伙 埃菲尔铁塔是他卖的
This bloke over here. He's sold the Eiffel Tower,

812
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:36,540
威斯敏斯特宫和悉尼歌剧院也是
the Palace Of Westminster and the Sydney Opera House.

813
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,100
我们让银行破产 搞垮企业 收拾政党
We broke banks, companies and political parties.

814
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,860
我们欺负拉斯维加斯黑手党
We took on the mafia in Las Vegas

815
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,900
还把伦敦政治保安处整得像一群饭桶
and we made the London Special Branch look like the Keystone Cops.

816
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,020
还想吓唬我们?省省吧!
So never mind about you two threatening us!

817
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,380
现在是我在威胁你们!
Now, I'm threatening you!

818
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,700
我们会拿你们作消遣
We're going to make you our hobby.

819
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:06,100
花几个通宵 想办法把你们榨干 把你们掏空
Spend sleepless nights working out how to take away everything from you, every penny.

820
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,300
你要担心的远不止这副该死的狗屁画
It won't be just a sodding painting you have to worry about,

821
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,580
好好盘算晚上要在哪儿落脚吧
you'll be working out where you're going to sleep at night.

822
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:20,700
因为我们要把你们给掏干净了
Because we're going to pick you clean.

823
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,340
我们会把你们骨头上的肉剔个精光
We'll strip every bit of flesh off the bone.

824
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:40,700
说得好 我就一个问题
Nice speech. I got just one question.

825
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,180
嗯 说?
Yeah, what's that?

826
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,860
你们这群家伙要是死了 还怎么做事呢?
How are you lot going to do that, when you're dead?

827
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,940
很好
Very good.

828
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:53,820
现在 把我的画给我
Now, give me my painting.

829
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,860
不 不 把我的画给我才是
No. No. You give me MY painting.

830
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,700
有些人就是不听话 对吧?
Some people never listen, do they?

831
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,180
跟你们讲...
I tell you what...

832
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,460
你们自己解决
you can sort it out amongst yourselves.

833
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,860
把它踢到旁边去! 嗯 就是这样
Get it round the side! Yeah, that's it.

834
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,860
瞧你在干嘛!
Watch what you're doing!

835
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,660
别伤到画!
Don't damage it!

836
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:01,100
电话也不来个 手信也没有
You didn't phone, you didn't write.

837
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,060
对不起啦 我一直束手束脚的
Sorry, mate, I've been a bit tied up.

838
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,380
是那谁吗?
Is that who I think it is?

839
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,820
嗯 Harry Holmes
Harry Holmes, yeah.

840
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,700
还好他出现了
Good job he turned up.

841
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,580
嗯 额...我打给他的
Yeah, well...I phoned him.

842
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,220
-你打给他?  -嗯
-You phoned him?  -Yeah.

843
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,660
那我们现在干嘛?
So what do we do now?

844
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,060
喂 Harry?
Hello. Harry?

845
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:33,980
你想鸡道McCrary兄弟瞒着你干了咩勾当吗?
Would you be interested to know who the McCrary boys were working for when they double-crossed you?

846
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,580
系啊 我鸡道啊 你有笔吗?
Aye, I do know. Have you got a pen?

847
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,140
看好画啊 行不行啊?
Just watch the painting, will ya?

848
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,940
他们好像不对付
They don't seem to like each other very much.

849
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,700
嗯 那个 我 呃...我给另一个也打了电话
No, well, I er...I phoned the other one 'an all.

850
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,320
Harry Holmes
Harry Holmes.

851
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,740
嗯 他骗了偶的一个朋友啦
Yes, he cheated a friend of mine.

852
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:57,700
所以当偶发现素他偷了你的画呢
So when I found out he stole your painting,

853
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,340
偶就想要打给你啦
I thought it right to call you.

854
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,310
而且我还打给老Bill以防情势失控 
And I phoned the Old Bill in case it went pear-shaped.

855
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:04,300
他们随时会到
They should be here any minute.

856
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,740
我拿到了!
I've got it!

857
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:17,540
噢 那是毕加索真迹吗?
Oh. Is that the real Picasso?

858
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:19,460
不 不 不 不是 是赝品
Oh, no, no. No, that's a fake.

859
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,740
伙计们 我能...我能问个问题吗?
Guys. Can I... Can I ask a question?

860
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,540
嗯嗯 问吧
Yeah, yeah.

861
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,690
我是说 我不想听起来不领情或者怎样
I mean, I don't want to sound ungrateful or anything.

862
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:29,140
没事儿
No, it's OK.

863
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,460
弄到真迹的话 会不会轻松一点啊?
Wouldn't it have been simpler to get the real painting?

864
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,100
当我没说
It's OK.

865
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,060
-干杯 Ed  -谢谢你
-Cheers, Ed.  -Thank you.

866
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,780
那么 没人找我们吗?
So no-one's looking for us?

867
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,020
没有 没有 你看 他们都以为
No. No, you see, they both thought that the original was damaged

868
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:57,620
真迹在仓库里干架的时候毁掉了
in the fight at the warehouse.

869
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,130
而不管Petre Sava
But neither Petre Sava

870
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,580
还是Harry Holmes都丢不起这个脸
nor Harry Holmes could afford to lose face.

871
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,700
所以他们只能各自伪造一幅 挽回脸面
So the only way they could save face was to have a fake each.

872
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:11,500
那样的话 他们都能说自己赢了 面子上也过得去了
That way, they could both say they won and honour is restored.

873
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,820
然后从此他们就永远和睦相处了
And they all get to live happily ever after.

874
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:17,620
下面一点 啊
Down. Ah.

875
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,180
嗯 你懂的 有多和睦就多和睦
Yeah, well, you know, happy as they can be.

876
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,940
太完美了
Perfect.

877
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:24,180
貌似McCrary兄弟才是唯一的赢家
It seems the only winners are the McCrary boys.

878
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,660
-此话怎讲  -他们就拿了40万块而已
-Tell me about it.  -They just walked off with 400 grand.

879
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:29,180
喔喔 他们把钱都拿走也不打紧
Whoa, they might get to go with all the money

880
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,480
可我们把Mickey这块宝找回来了啊
but we got something much more precious. We got Mickey back.

881
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,380
哦对 有道理
Oh, yes, that's true.

882
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,700
-对  -啊 谢谢各位  -友谊无价
-Yeah.  -Ah. Thanks, guys.  -You can't put a price on friendship.

883
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,380
非要定个价么 大概也就40万
But if you could, it'd be about 400 grand.

884
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,220
别理他 你不在他六神无主哦
Ignore him - he was beside himself when you were gone.

885
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,740
大家都怪他 他自我厌恶透了
He was taking all the blame, he was full of self-loathing.

886
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,500
-看得人心碎啊 真的  -嗯 嗯
-Really heartbreaking to watch.It was.  -Yeah, yeah.

887
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,770
我们什么也没挣着
We made no money,

888
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:50,880
不过除了几块淤青 还算平安无事
but apart from the odd bruise, everything turned out OK.

889
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,540
嗯 说的是
Yes, it did.

890
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:53,100
Ash 我得问你
Ash, I've got to ask you,

891
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,900
你真的在仓库里拿那帮匪徒没办法?
did you really lose it with those gangsters at the warehouse?

892
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,060
我们当时别无他法
We hadn't got a lot of options at that point,

893
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:01,220
-所以我就想说点米式胡话  -哦 对 对 对
-so I thought I'd do a bit of Mickey waffle.  -Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

894
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,310
"米式胡话"?
"Mickey waffle"?

895
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,060
嗯 就是那种说了半天 等于什么也没说啊
Yeah, you know that thing where you talk a lot but don't actually say anything.

896
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,460
不好意思 不 我又不说胡话
Sorry, no, I do not "waffle".

897
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,030
-偶尔  -什么时候?  
-You do a bit.  -When?

898
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,180
通常是你知道你有错 但你死不承认的时候
When? Usually when you know you're wrong but you won't admit it.

899
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:17,260
抱歉 抱歉 那怎么会是胡话呢
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but that's far from waffling,

900
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,140
只不过是我呈现合理论点的方式
that's just my way of presenting a reasoned argument.

901
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,860
基本上 是一种拿出事实的方式 Ash
A way of putting forward the facts, which in the main, Ash,

902
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:25,020
抱歉地说 这点你就做不到
I'm sorry to say, is something you fail to do.

903
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,110
你更喜欢用动人的花言巧语来表达观点
You prefer to use emotional rhetoric littered with expletives

904
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,140
还夹杂三字经
to make your point.

905
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:31,700
不 是真的 是真的
No, it's true, it's true.

906
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,460
那不是"胡话"
That was NOT "waffling".

907
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,340
还不如把我关在后备箱里呢
I wish you'd left me in the boot now.

908
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:39,920
-额 可以啊  -我把明天的报纸给你们拿来了
-Well, it can be arranged.  -I brought you tomorrow's papers.

909
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,500
哦 乌拉
Oh, cheers.

910
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:42,180
又是那个小鸟依人的Dolly
That was that Dolly bird again.

911
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:44,700
我本来想在你说胡话的时候朝你大吼来着
I was going to give you a shout but you were waffling.

912
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,100
-好的 Ed  -我没说胡话  -当然没有
-Cheers, Ed.  -I wasn't waffling.  -Course not.

913
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,730
额...这女人...
Erm...this Dolly...

914
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:53,940
她在电话里听起来超媚的 她如何?
she sounds a bit of all right on the phone. What's she like?

915
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,230
哦 现在...现在...她很特别哦
Oh, now...now...she is special.

916
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,340
是吧?靓吗?
Yeah? Is she a looker?

917
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:03,060
哦...当然啦
Oh...definitely.

918
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:04,130
她很靓吗?
Is she a looker?

919
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,280
一口可爱的牙齿 对吧 Sean?
Got a lovely set of teeth, hasn't she, Sean?

920
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:06,740
迷死人了
Amazing.

921
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:10,020
我们才聊了几句 我们很投机
Only we had a little bit of a chat. We got on like a house on fire.

922
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,300
我猜她在调情 当时她 呃...
Think she was flirting a bit when she, er...

923
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,300
她刚开口的时候 她说她喜欢我的口音 那么 
when she rang earlier, you know, she said she liked me accent and that so,

924
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,740
额...你懂的...
er...so you know...

925
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,140
-该试它一试  -"它"?
-might have a crack at it like.  -"It"?

926
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,180
嗯 嗯 你不介意吧?
Yeah, yeah, you don't mind, do you?

927
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,340
我可不想惹到谁
I don't want to tread on anyone's toes.

928
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,820
没 很好啊 你去试试"它"好了
No. Good for you, you go for "it".

929
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,860
她邀我出来喝一杯
She's invited me round for a drink.

930
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:35,140
-哦?  -Edward 你们是天造地设的一对
-Yeah?  -Edward. This is a match made in heaven.

931
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:36,700
你这么觉得?
You think so?

932
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:40,220
绝对的 你随意 小子
Absolutely. You knock yourself out, son.

933
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:43,140
好类 各位 我要是泡上了会告诉你们的
Cheers, guys. I'll let you know how I get on.

934
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,660
-觉不觉得残忍了点?  -嗯 有点吧
-Do you think that was a bit cruel?  -Yeah. Probably.

935
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,460
哦 听好这个
Oh, listen to this.

936
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,600
上面说伦敦市中心的一家画廊
It says here that a Mondrian was stolen

937
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,140
有幅蒙德里安的画被盗
from a gallery in Central London,

938
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:05,380
估价有230万镑
and it's valued at ￡2.3 million.

939
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,620
Tucker还做不做蒙德里安的赝品?
Doesn't Tucker still do fake Mondrians?

940
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,300
-开玩笑啦  -哦耶!
-It was a joke.  -Yeah!

941
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,260
-瞧瞧你们的脸色的  -啊喂!
-Should've seen your faces.  -Oi!

942
