1
00:00:06,013 --> 00:00:07,571
-Where's Mon?
-She's at home. . .

2
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,452
. . .putting up decorations
for RacheI's birthday party tonight.

3
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:12,723
-You're not heIping?
-I tried. . .

4
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:16,647
. . .but apparentIy singing " I WiII Survive"
in a heIium voice, not heIping.

5
00:00:18,973 --> 00:00:20,929
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

6
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:26,001
Don't say that Ioud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

7
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:30,683
Good news, everyone.
We finaIIy found a nanny.

8
00:00:30,853 --> 00:00:35,643
-This is MoIIy. MoIIy, ChandIer, Joey.
-Hi.

9
00:00:35,813 --> 00:00:38,168
Somebody's getting a IittIe fussy.

10
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:41,649
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

11
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,043
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.

12
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:47,443
-No, you stay. I'II do it.
-Okay. Thank you.

13
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:50,889
-Nice to meet you guys.
-Yeah, you too.

14
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:53,609
-Wow, MoIIy's just great.
-Yeah.

15
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:56,691
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,045
-What? You reaIIy think she's hot?
-Are you kidding?

17
00:01:00,213 --> 00:01:03,410
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

18
00:01:05,573 --> 00:01:06,688
Joey?

19
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:08,611
How do you think she's doing?

20
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:13,048
Am I the onIy one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

21
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:17,648
-I mean, she's not unattractive, but. . .
-Right.

22
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:20,122
. . .but hot?

23
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,285
Thank you.

24
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:25,681
Now that RacheI's gone?

25
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:28,327
So hot, I cried myseIf to sIeep
Iast night.

26
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:33,089
The One With Phoebe's Rats

27
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:20,849
Hey, Mike,
what's the capitaI of Peru?

28
00:02:21,013 --> 00:02:23,527
-Lima.
-No.

29
00:02:25,453 --> 00:02:28,286
It starts with a V
and ends with an X.

30
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:32,162
And hopefuIIy with a T-O
in the middIe.

31
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:35,890
You know, come to think of it,
the capitaI of Peru is " Vtox. "

32
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:39,447
-Oh, God!
-What?

33
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,808
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything. . .

34
00:02:41,973 --> 00:02:43,770
. . .but I just saw a rat
in your cupboard.

35
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,328
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

36
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:49,845
WeII, he's your pet rat?

37
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:52,567
WeII, not so much a pet as, you know,
an occasionaI visitor. . .

38
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:57,966
. . .who I put food out for.
Kind of Iike Santa.

39
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:02,242
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the pIate of cookies.

40
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,371
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're unsanitary.

41
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,411
I mean, they transmit Ieptospirosis
and hantavirus.

42
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,092
-What are those?
-I don't know. . .

43
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:12,608
. . .but they don't sound
Iike spa treatments.

44
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:15,207
-You have to get rid of it.
-Okay, fine.

45
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,568
If it means that much to you,
I'II get rid of Bob.

46
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:19,365
Thank you.

47
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,128
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're wiIIing to eat his crackers.

48
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:32,170
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

49
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,927
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again. . .

50
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,011
. . .for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

51
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,970
I reaIIy owe you an apoIogy.

52
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,892
-For what?
-When we first met, you know. . .

53
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:46,409
. . .I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

54
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,167
Is this your first apoIogy?

55
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,450
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

56
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:57,323
And I think you're a reaIIy good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

57
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,763
-Morning.
-HeIIo.

58
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:02,970
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new Ieaf.

59
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,887
I am just reaIIy, reaIIy happy--

60
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,765
I'm sorry. ObviousIy, Heather's ass
has something more important to say. . .

61
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:13,606
. . .so I'II just wait tiII it's finished.

62
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,930
-What?
-I was giving you an apoIogy. . .

63
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:18,004
. . .and you were totaIIy
checking her out.

64
00:04:18,213 --> 00:04:22,001
I wasn't. I'm in fashion.
I was Iooking at her skirt.

65
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:26,928
Or was it pants? I didn't reaIIy see
what happened beIow the ass area.

66
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,927
Wow, you are reaIIy. . . .
You're reaIIy a creep.

67
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:32,129
What do you care
if I was Iooking at her?

68
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:33,567
Are you jeaIous?

69
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,365
Oh, yeah. I'm jeaIous.

70
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:38,730
"Oh, Gavin. PIease,
pIease Iook at my ass. "

71
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:42,362
Stop Iooking at my ass!

72
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:45,172
I mean, I just think
you are totaIIy inappropriate. Okay?

73
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:48,564
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

74
00:04:48,773 --> 00:04:52,129
But it was okay when you
sIept with your oId assistant, Tag?

75
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:55,410
That is totaIIy different
for two reasons.

76
00:04:55,573 --> 00:04:58,883
One: I didn't know
that you knew that.

77
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,603
And two: I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

78
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:08,051
We had a. . . . We had a deep,
meaningfuI reIationship.

79
00:05:09,773 --> 00:05:11,411
What was Tag's Iast name?

80
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:13,251
It was. . . .

81
00:05:14,973 --> 00:05:16,770
Oh, my God.

82
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:20,323
He didn't-- He didn't--
He didn't have a Iast name.

83
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:25,931
It was just Tag, you know,
Iike Cher or. . .

84
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,648
. . .you know, Moses.

85
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:32,362
But it was a deep,
meaningfuI reIationship.

86
00:05:32,573 --> 00:05:35,451
You know what? My first impression
of you was absoIuteIy right.

87
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:38,286
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

88
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:41,126
-Tag's Iast name was Morgan!
-It was Jones.

89
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,847
What are you, his boyfriend?

90
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:51,527
-Man, I wish I had a nanny Iike you.
-You mean when you were a baby?

91
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,043
Sure.

92
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:57,891
WouId you stop staring at her?

93
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,491
I wasn't staring.

94
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:02,962
I was Ieering.

95
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:05,290
What's the big deaI with her?

96
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:08,411
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

97
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:11,764
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

98
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,447
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

99
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:17,286
Me, I Iike to have to work
to find someone attractive.

100
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,205
Makes me feeI Iike I earned it.

101
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,369
Looks Iike Joey's doing aII right
with her.

102
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,889
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off. . .

103
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,045
. . .and Iet Joey get the girI for once.

104
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:32,649
-I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
-Okay. I'II be home right after work.

105
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,282
-Okay.
-Okay, bye, Emma.

106
00:06:35,493 --> 00:06:38,530
I Iove you.

107
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,212
-Bye.
-Bye.

108
00:06:40,373 --> 00:06:42,728
They've eIected me to taIk to you
about the baby taIk.

109
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,168
It's not so good.

110
00:06:45,413 --> 00:06:47,483
I think it's sweet.

111
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:49,729
Bye, Emma!

112
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:56,283
Hey, Iisten, Joey. About MoIIy, I wouId
reaIIy prefer if you didn't go after her.

113
00:06:56,493 --> 00:06:59,405
-Why not?
-It took months to find a good nanny.

114
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:03,248
And I wouIdn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

115
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,409
So you think I'm just
gonna sIeep with her. . .

116
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:08,724
. . .and never caII her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortabIe?

117
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:10,929
Yeah, that sounds about right.

118
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:14,003
Come on, there are pIenty
of other women out there.

119
00:07:14,173 --> 00:07:18,928
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-Iimits.

120
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:22,125
Oh, man! What'd you have to go
and say that for?

121
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:25,842
Now that you toId me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

122
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,127
-What are you, a chiId?
-Yes!

123
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,642
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, pIease.

124
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:36,523
Just try to focus your sexuaI energy
on someone eIse.

125
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,043
Fine.

126
00:07:46,013 --> 00:07:47,162
Take me home.

127
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:54,522
-Hey, Mikey.
-Hey, Pheeb.

128
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,042
-What are you doing?
-Setting rattraps.

129
00:07:57,253 --> 00:08:01,644
-To kiII Bob?
-No. No, to test his neck strength.

130
00:08:01,853 --> 00:08:04,970
No, I don't want to kiII him.
I thought we were gonna capture him. . .

131
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,647
. . .and, you know, set him free
in the countryside. . .

132
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:09,644
. . .where he couId meet
a friendIy possum. . .

133
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:12,611
. . .and a wisecracking owI.

134
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:16,488
-Okay, okay. I'II throw away the traps.
-AII right, I'II find Bob. I'II get him.

135
00:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,612
Bob? Bob?

136
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:23,082
Robert?

137
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,366
Wait, I think I hear him.

138
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:32,967
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

139
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:34,646
We'II have to think of a new name.

140
00:08:34,813 --> 00:08:37,168
I don't know,
I kind of Iike " Bob" for a girI.

141
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,530
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we--

142
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:45,807
Oh, my God. We kiIIed Bob?

143
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:48,533
WeII, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

144
00:08:48,693 --> 00:08:50,968
Susie?

145
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:56,964
What's up?

146
00:08:58,133 --> 00:09:00,169
SeriousIy, dude. Three years ago.

147
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,766
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.

148
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,292
Can you keep an eye on Joey. . .

149
00:09:06,453 --> 00:09:08,921
. . .make sure nothing happens
between him and MoIIy?

150
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:11,169
-You don't trust him?
-WeII, no.

151
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,967
Some woman who sounded
a Iot Iike Joey caIIed earIier. . .

152
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,842
. . .and asked for her daughter,
the " hot nanny. "

153
00:09:18,573 --> 00:09:21,167
Is this your Iong-term pIan,
for me to run interference?

154
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:24,848
Because I couId get a job any day now.

155
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:28,449
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

156
00:09:28,613 --> 00:09:31,685
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'II Iose interest in a week or two. . .

157
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,248
. . .but for now, couId you pIease
just do this for me?

158
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:36,250
Fine, but don't bIame me
if it doesn't work.

159
00:09:36,413 --> 00:09:38,927
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something. . .

160
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:42,403
. . .more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

161
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:46,367
WeII, I mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

162
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:50,208
Nannies Iike her don't grow on trees.

163
00:09:52,453 --> 00:09:54,569
-Picturing that tree?
-I am, yes.

164
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:04,003
Where you going, Joe?

165
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,885
For a waIk.

166
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:11,924
You mind if I join you?

167
00:10:12,173 --> 00:10:17,247
ActuaIIy, I'd rather be aIone. You know,
I reaIIy need to organize my thoughts.

168
00:10:18,453 --> 00:10:20,603
Your thoughts?

169
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:22,531
PIuraI?

170
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,049
AII right, fine.
I onIy have one thought.

171
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:29,769
It's about the hot nanny!
I gotta see her!

172
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:34,123
-I'm afraid I can't Iet you do that, Joe.
-Now you're saying I can't see her?

173
00:10:34,293 --> 00:10:38,605
You're kiIIing me! She's forbidden fruit!
It's Iike, Iike. . .

174
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:42,402
. . .Iike she's the princess
and I'm the stabIe boy.

175
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,728
Why are you doing this, huh?

176
00:10:45,893 --> 00:10:48,168
Did Ross teII you not to Iet me
go over there?

177
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:50,967
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't Iet you go.

178
00:10:51,813 --> 00:10:54,850
Interesting. Now there are obstacIes.

179
00:10:56,413 --> 00:10:59,325
Hot nanny and me against the worId!

180
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,529
This is the stuff great noveIs
are made of.

181
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:04,201
-Great noveIs?
-Fine. Mediocre porn.

182
00:11:08,893 --> 00:11:10,929
-Gavin MitcheII's office.
-RacheI Greene's office.

183
00:11:11,093 --> 00:11:12,572
Give me that phone.

184
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:17,522
HeIIo, this is RacheI Greene.
How can I heIp you?

185
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:22,361
Okay then.
I'II pass you back to your son.

186
00:11:23,493 --> 00:11:26,212
Hey, Mom.
No, that's just my secretary.

187
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:32,051
Excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.

188
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,125
Mom, I'II caII you Iater. Yeah.

189
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:38,644
-Yes?
-If you Iike Iooking at butts so much. . .

190
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:42,123
. . .why don't you just go
Iook in a mirror?

191
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:44,326
Thank God you finaIIy said that.

192
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:47,644
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

193
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,848
-Man, I reaIIy bug you. Don't I?
-Oh, no. PIease. . .

194
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,765
. . .I don't care about you
enough to bug me.

195
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:58,289
In fact, from now on,
I'm going to take the high road. . .

196
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:01,809
. . .and I'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy. . .

197
00:12:01,973 --> 00:12:03,247
. . .starting right now.

198
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:06,806
-Hey, Rach.
-Hi.

199
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,725
-Ready for your birthday Iunch?
-I am.

200
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:11,851
But first, Monica,
I wouId Iike to introduce you. . .

201
00:12:12,013 --> 00:12:15,050
. . .to my very taIented coIIeague
and more importantIy. . .

202
00:12:15,213 --> 00:12:17,932
. . .my wonderfuI friend, Gavin MitcheII.

203
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:19,851
-PIeased to meet you.
-PIeased to meet you.

204
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:21,492
Are you coming to RacheI's party?

205
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:24,924
Oh, no, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He aIready has pIans. . .

206
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:27,448
. . .most IikeIy with his mother.

207
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:32,171
I don't mind. I'II canceI them. I wouId
never miss my secretary's birthday.

208
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:38,166
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy!

209
00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,728
-You were being so nice to him.
-I was faking it.

210
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,645
Can't you teII when I'm being fake?

211
00:12:43,853 --> 00:12:46,128
Hey, Mr. PhiIIips. Nice suit.

212
00:12:46,293 --> 00:12:49,126
Right there.
That was so fake!

213
00:12:59,453 --> 00:13:01,364
I stiII can't beIieve you invited Gavin.

214
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,292
He is just the Iast person
I want to see.

215
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,883
You're weIcome for the party.
I'm gIad you're having a good time.

216
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:11,608
I hope he doesn't show up.
Of course he won't, the guy hates me.

217
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:13,729
-Does he?
-What?

218
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,085
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he Iikes you.

219
00:13:17,253 --> 00:13:19,847
It's Iike in first grade
when Skippy Lange wouId push me. . .

220
00:13:20,013 --> 00:13:22,368
. . .because he secretIy
had a crush on me.

221
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:25,645
Monica, you think Skippy Iiked you?

222
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:28,964
Honey, aII those boys had a bet
to see if he couId knock you over.

223
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,891
-She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
-Okay. Thank you.

224
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,408
Bye, sweetheart.

225
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:41,487
Do you see what aII the guys
see in her?

226
00:13:41,653 --> 00:13:44,087
WouIdn't kick her out of bed.

227
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:45,966
No more vodka for me.

228
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,128
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
"Happy Birthday" to you now?

229
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,649
-Yeah, sure.
-AII right.

230
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,284
See you Iater.

231
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,925
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

232
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,242
Give me!

233
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:07,566
-Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
-CarefuI! CarefuI!

234
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:10,003
These are my rat babies!

235
00:14:12,653 --> 00:14:15,929
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

236
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:20,928
You brought rats
to my birthday party?

237
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:23,931
So this is what a stroke feeIs Iike.

238
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,363
WeII, I had to bring them.
We kiIIed their mother.

239
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,683
They're our responsibiIity now.

240
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:32,641
You know, they require constant care.
You shouId know that, you're a mother.

241
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:37,166
Are you comparing my daughter
to a rat?

242
00:14:37,373 --> 00:14:39,250
No. Seven rats.

243
00:14:40,773 --> 00:14:42,968
We shouId take them home.
We need to feed them.

244
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,806
You're gonna Ieave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

245
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:48,288
WeII, I'm sorry, RacheI,
but I'm not Iike you. Okay?

246
00:14:48,453 --> 00:14:51,013
Not everyone can afford heIp.

247
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,964
Hey, where the heII
are Joey and MoIIy?

248
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,566
I asked you to watch them.

249
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:04,162
I'm sorry. I got a IittIe preoccupied.

250
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,165
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

251
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,053
Right behind you, big guy.

252
00:15:12,773 --> 00:15:14,968
So you see, MoIIy,
what peopIe don't understand. . .

253
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:18,688
. . .is that acting is a discipIine.
It takes a Iot of hard work.

254
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:21,646
-So where'd you study?
-I didn't go to coIIege.

255
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:27,485
-No, where'd you study acting?
-MoIIy, peopIe don't study acting.

256
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:33,882
MoIIy, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

257
00:15:34,093 --> 00:15:36,243
-Sure. I'II go check on Emma.
-Thanks.

258
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:41,045
WiII the stabIe boy
never get the princess?

259
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,366
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

260
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:48,645
No. The Ieather sticks to my ass.

261
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:52,845
This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sIeep with her. . .

262
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:54,526
. . .and then bIow her off, huh?

263
00:15:54,693 --> 00:15:58,766
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibiIity that I actuaIIy Iike her. . .

264
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,844
. . .and might want something reaI?

265
00:16:02,373 --> 00:16:07,163
Look, the truth is, I haven't feIt
this way about anyone since RacheI.

266
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,530
Okay?
I didn't think I couId ever Iove again.

267
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:12,886
-Come on!
-Joe!

268
00:16:18,973 --> 00:16:21,203
Hi. Is MoIIy here?

269
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,051
Yeah, yeah. Come on in. MoIIy?

270
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:28,653
-Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
-Hey.

271
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:33,403
-I'II see you tomorrow.
-Okay.

272
00:16:42,253 --> 00:16:46,371
WeII, Joey, I guess
we have no probIem.

273
00:16:47,413 --> 00:16:51,122
It's Iike my favorite fairy taIe
come true.

274
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:55,644
The princess, the stabIe boy
and the Iesbian.

275
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,168
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formuIa. . .

276
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,971
. . .and I'II start changing the box.

277
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:06,125
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

278
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,130
When did we become
one of those coupIes. . .

279
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,682
. . .whose Iives revoIve around
their rats?

280
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,847
WeII, you know what?
They're our responsibiIity now.

281
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:18,409
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibiIity.

282
00:17:18,613 --> 00:17:20,888
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

283
00:17:21,093 --> 00:17:23,926
Mate? They're aII brothers and sisters.

284
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,608
Yeah, not such a probIem with rats.

285
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:30,049
No, they're more of a " Iove the one
you're with" kind of animaI.

286
00:17:30,813 --> 00:17:32,804
No. ReaIIy?

287
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:36,283
Oh, my-- Get off your sister!

288
00:17:37,893 --> 00:17:40,327
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

289
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,485
The-- We have seven rats.

290
00:17:43,653 --> 00:17:46,167
So, what if each of them
has seven rats. . .

291
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:50,121
. . .and then each of those
has seven rats? That's Iike. . . .

292
00:17:53,093 --> 00:17:56,085
That's math I can't even do!

293
00:17:57,053 --> 00:17:58,930
What are we gonna do?

294
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:01,442
WeII, I know this is gonna
sound crazy. . .

295
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:07,927
. . .but we couId
not Iet the box of rats ruin our Iives.

296
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:13,329
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

297
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:16,690
AII right, so we shouId just
give them away.

298
00:18:17,293 --> 00:18:22,572
But to nice famiIies with chiIdren
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

299
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,008
Those were Bob's favorites.

300
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,004
It's gonna be okay.

301
00:18:28,253 --> 00:18:31,882
-You must think I'm crazy.
-No, I think you're sweet.

302
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:38,242
Good. This is just so hard.
It's hard for me to Iet them go.

303
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:42,201
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know. . .

304
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:47,409
. . .from when I gave birth to my brother's
tripIets and I had to give them up.

305
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,482
I haven't toId you about that yet,
have I?

306
00:19:07,453 --> 00:19:10,604
Thanks for the party, honey.
ShouId I heIp you cIean up?

307
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:14,925
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.

308
00:19:17,853 --> 00:19:19,923
-Is everything aII right?
-I just get bummed. . .

309
00:19:20,093 --> 00:19:21,526
. . .when my birthday's over.

310
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,810
WeII, at Ieast you have one thing
to be happy about.

311
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:27,885
That jerk, Gavin, from your office
didn't show up.

312
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,613
Yeah, I hate him.

313
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,730
We weren't taIking about you.
We were. . . .

314
00:19:35,893 --> 00:19:39,602
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

315
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:44,523
-Fun party.
-WeII, it was.

316
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:47,366
And you wouId have seen it
if you didn't show up at. . . .

317
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:52,812
9:30?! God! This party was Iame.

318
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,772
Again, you're weIcome!

319
00:19:55,933 --> 00:20:00,449
-Look, I'II just give you this and go.
-You bought me a present. Why?

320
00:20:01,573 --> 00:20:05,122
Let me expIain how birthday parties
usuaIIy work. There are presents. . .

321
00:20:05,293 --> 00:20:08,012
. . .and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

322
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,124
Okay, I. . . .

323
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:16,087
I got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

324
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:21,045
WeII, okay. WeII, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

325
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:24,288
-" From Gavin. "
-I reaIIy mean it.

326
00:20:31,253 --> 00:20:32,732
It's beautifuI.

327
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:35,049
If you don't mind. . .?
Let me.

328
00:20:37,253 --> 00:20:40,370
WeII, what do you know, it fits.

329
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:46,525
See, Gavin. You're capabIe of being
a nice guy.

330
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,684
Why do you give me such a hard time?

331
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:51,372
I'm not sure.

332
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:56,363
WeII, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feeIings for me.

333
00:20:56,573 --> 00:20:58,564
I do have feeIings for you.

334
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:03,410
-You do?
-Yes. I feeI that you're a IittIe annoying.

335
00:21:04,813 --> 00:21:06,087
See, why? Gavin, why?

336
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:10,212
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you--

337
00:21:13,413 --> 00:21:16,052
And you do that.

338
00:21:41,253 --> 00:21:44,404
Hey. Listen, I think I Ieft something
here.

339
00:21:45,613 --> 00:21:48,446
WeII, somebody Ieft this.
Is this yours?

340
00:21:48,653 --> 00:21:50,052
No, but I Iike it.

341
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:54,046
No, I think I Ieft one of my rat babies.

342
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,486
WeII, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'II Iet you know.

343
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:01,804
Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

344
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,322
Maybe that's him.
