1
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,010
Gentlemen,I put it to you:
先生们 我告诉你们哟

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,040
the worst tapioca pudding is better than
the best pudding of any other flavor.
最难吃西米布丁也好过其他口味优质布丁

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,510
First off,that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.
首先 明眼人都知道这话错的
因为最好的布丁是巧克力口味

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,570
Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.
其次 西米的有机结构使布丁
黏糊糊摇晃晃 有潜在致命危险

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,940
It is extracted from the plant...
是从植物里提取...

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,140
Hey,I'm thinking of growing a mustache.
嘿 我在考虑留点胡子

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:29,360
No kidding?
不是吧?

8
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,370
Fu Manchu, a handlebar,pencil?
傅满洲那样的? 八字胡 又尖又长?

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,810
- It's extracted from the plant.
- I'm not sure yet.
- 是从植物中提取
- 还没想好呢

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,350
You know,George Clooney has one now.
乔治・克鲁尼现在也留胡子呢

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,140
Really? I once saw him shopping
at Ralph's. He was buying tequila.
真的? 我看到过他在Ralphs超市买龙舌兰酒

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,280
You'd think a guy like that would
have some kind of booze lackey.
你以为他们会有仆人跑腿买酒吗?

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,790
All right, this is cruel.
好啦 太残忍了

14
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,580
We'd better let him finish
before his head explodes.
我们还是让他说完
不然人家要爆头了

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,700
All right,Sheldon, why is tap...
好吧 Sheldon 为啥西...

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,240
Tapioca is extracted from the root
of the plant manihot esculenta!
西米由食用木薯根茎提取而成

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,790
Due to a high concentration of cyanide,
由于富含高浓度的氰化物

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,390
it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly!
其本身有毒性 如加工不当即食用会致命

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,030
Feel better now?
现在爽了吧?

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,460
It is also indigenous to Brazil as is the coa
bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding.
同时可可豆也是巴西的
从中能提取巧克力 做最好的布丁

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,360
And you promised you
wouldn't do that anymore!
求你们别再耍我了!

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,510
Hey,Hofstadter.
嘿 Hofstadter

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,280
Hey,Kripke.
嘿 Kripke

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,930
Heard about your latest
anti-proton decay experiment.
听说你最新的反质子衰变实验了

25
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,270
20,000 data runs and no
statistically significant results.
收集两万数据 却没啥有用的结果

26
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,870
Very impressive.
灰常了得

27
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,760
What a jerk.
蠢货一个

28
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,270
Don't feel bad,Leonard. Negative
results are still results.
别气馁 Leonard 没用的结果也是结果

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
- Even 20,000 of them.
- All right!
- 就算两万又算啥
- 行啦!

30
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,170
Please don't cheer me up anymore.
求你们别在给我打气了

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,490
Come on. Don't let him
get to you. It's Kripke.
别呀 不要让他打击到你
Kripke哪根葱

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,480
Yeah,he's a ginormous knob.
对呀 大蠢蛋一个

33
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:46,820
That's why he eats by himself instead
of sitting here at the cool table.
所以他孤单用餐
而不能坐到这酷酷的桌子来

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,770
For shizzle.
说得对呀

35
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,070
It's true Kripke lacks the basic
social skills that we take for granted.
确实啊 Kripke确实缺乏
咱固有的那种基本社交技巧

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,280
But he also controls the new
open science grid computer
但他还操控着新的开放科学网格计算机

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,370
that I need to use to run some simulations
of structure formation in the early universe.
而我需要它来模拟宇宙早期的结构形态

38
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,920
Well,good luck getting time on it.
看你有没有那命用上吧

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,360
The only people he lets
use it are his friends.
他可只让他的朋友使用

40
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,630
Well,then, the solution is simple.
那 解决办法很简单嘛

41
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,470
I shall befriend him.
我去和他做朋友

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,930
Kripke!
Kripke!

43
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,610
Yeah?
啥事?

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,010
What would you say to the idea
of you and I becoming friends?
你觉得我们交个朋友如何?

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
I would say I have no interest
in becoming your friend.
我觉得木有啥兴趣哟

46
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,340
Really?
当真?

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,560
That seems rather shortsighted coming from someone
who is generally considered altogether unlikable.
你个里里外外不受欢迎的家伙
目光还真是相当短浅呀

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,210
Why don't you take
some time to reconsider?
不如重新考虑下吧?

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,540
Yeah,I'll do that.
行呀 我去想想

50
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,250
Well,I think we're off
to a terrific start.
看来咱这开局不错啊

go right into your spam folder.
现在所有Wolowitz发来的邮件
都会直接进入垃圾箱

56
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,960
Thanks. I mean, the e-mail doesn't bother me as much
as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
多谢 其实骚扰邮件倒没啥
他穿浴衣的度假照比较雷人

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah,I got the same one, and that's
not a bathing suit. It's a tan line.
是呀 我也收到了
那可不是浴衣 是晒痕

58
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,820
Hello,this is Sheldon Cooper.

00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,370
I am leaving a message for Barry Kripke.

60
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,970
Barry,it was pleasant seeing
you today in the cafeteria.
Barry 很高兴在食堂与你邂逅

61
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,350
I saw that you purchased
the chef's salad.
我注意到你买了推荐沙拉

62
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,810
Apparently,you did not know that the chef's
salad is kitchen trickery to utilize scrap meat.
显然 你不知道推荐沙拉是
食堂的杂碎肉骗人把戏

63
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,190
Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it.
不过呢 我希望你用餐愉快

64

look forward to hearing from you regarding its status.

Sheldon Cooper.

66
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,160
What's up with Ichabod?

00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,610
Uh,he's trying to make a new friend.
他在交友呢

68
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,150
Oh,really? Well,good for him.
真的? 不错嘛

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,220
Well,unless he makes one out of wood like
Geppetto, I don't think it's gonna happen.
除非他像杰佩托做出皮诺曹
不然没戏的

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,300
How did you guys become friends?
那你们咋成为朋友的?

71
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,370
There was a flyer on the
bulletin board at the university:
大学公告板上的一张传单

72
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,070
"Roommate wanted.Whistlers
need not apply."
"招募室友 吹口哨的勿扰"

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,070
And you moved in anyway?
你就搬进去了?

74
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,920
I assumed he was joking.
我以为他说着玩的

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,910
You'd be surprised how many particle
physicists have a whimsical side.
你绝对想不到有多少量子物理学家
都有反复无常的一面

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,450
What about Howard and Raj? I mean,how
did he become friends with them?
Howard和Raj呢?
我是说他咋和他们好上的?

77
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,530
I don't know. How do carbon
atoms form a benzene ring?
不知道 碳原子是如何构成苯环的?

78
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,400
Proximity and valence electrons.
价电子亲近

79
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,390
Well,sure, when you put it that way.
是呀 你这样说也是哈

80
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,840
But it all worked out,right?
但相处的也不错是吧

81
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,280
I suppose. I do miss whistling, though.
差不多吧 尽管我很怀念口哨

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,730
Oh,come on. Really?
不是吧?

83
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,240
First warning.

This is for you.
给你的

86
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,120
Hello,Sheldon.
你好 Sheldon

87
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,420
What is this?
这是啥?

88
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,850
It's a questionnaire I devised.
我设计的调查表

89
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,890
I'm having some difficulty
bonding with a colleague at work
我和一位同事交友遇到点困难

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,120
so I'm doing a little research to better
understand why my current friends like me.
所以我想做些小调查 更好的了解
为什么我目前的朋友们喜欢我

91
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,690
Yes,well,that is a good question.
嗯 这个问题值得考虑

92
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,460
But is this really the
best way to figure it out?
但你确定这是最好的办法了?

93
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,820
I agree. The social
sciences are largely hokum.
问得好 社会学家很大程度是忽悠

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,360
But short of putting electrodes in your brain
and monitoring your response to my companionship,
但又不能插一个电极到你的大脑
探测你对我友谊问题的反应

95
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,130
this is the best I can do.
就这方法还凑合了

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,740
Okay,"Question one: "Rank the
following aspects of Sheldon Cooper
好 "问题1: 按吸引力程度给
Sheldon Cooper以下各方面排序

97
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,890
playfulness; JAVA applet writing"?
聪明 洁癖 有趣 Java程序编写?"

98
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,200
I know,I may have started
out with a fairly obvious one;
也许头一个问题答案过分明显

99
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,890
an aspect of my most
appealing trait: playfulness.
谁不知道我最吸引人的特质之一 有趣

100
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,970
Why don't you just go ahead
and rank that number one?
你直接把它排到1号吧

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,720
I'm afraid you're on
your own for the rest.
恐怕剩下的我不能指导你了

102
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,830
It should take you no
more than three hours.
用不了三个小时就可以完成

103
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,500
Well,wait. How many
questions are on this thing?

104
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,930
Only 211.
区区211个

105
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,820
Don't worry. In deference to you, I kept them
all at a high school graduate reading level.
别担心 为了照顾你
这份高中毕业就能读懂

106
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,680
Thanks,pal.

107
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,370
You got it... buddy.
客气啥...姐们儿

108
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,510
Sheldon,honey,did you ever consider making
friends by being,I don't know, pleasant?
Sheldon 亲爱的 你有没有考虑过
通过让人开心来交友啊?

109
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,940
Well,that's certainly a
thought-provoking hypothesis.
那当然是一个发人深思的假设

110
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,740
May I suggest it as the
topic for your essay?
我看你论文写这题目好了

111
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,300
Your questionnaire, very disappointing.
你的调查问卷 十分让人失望呀

112
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,130
I answered every question, Sheldon.
我逢题必答呀 Sheldon

113
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,990
You answered the multiple
choice questions in a pattern:
你选择题很有规律嘛

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,840
A- B-A-C.A-
B-A-C.
A B B A C A B B A C

115
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,040
Oh,you picked up on that,huh?
你发现了哈

116
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,270
How could I not?
我怎么会发现不了?

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,680
Come on. There's over 200 questions.
行行好 超过200个问题

118
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,550
And look at some of these things.
看有些问题吧

119
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,100
"Sheldon is to camaraderie as
the space shuttle is to blank?"
"Sheldon之于友谊如同太空梭之于什么?"

120
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,630
There are a number
of acceptable answers.
这里有些适合的答案呀

121
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,850
For example, Near-Earth transport."

But certainly not Avocado rancher."
但绝对不是B鳄梨种植工

123
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,700
And your essay suggesting that I'd have better luck
making friends if I wait till the Cylons take over?
你在论文里还说等到赛昂人接管地球
我在交友方面会更有运气

124
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,770
Please.
请别

125
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,820
Now hold on. I put some
real work into that.
等等 那篇我可是认真写的

126
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,420
Yes,well,it's better
than what Wolowitz did.
是呀 可比Wolowitz好多了

127
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:41,930
He drew a raccoon with what
appears to be a distended scrotum.
他画了一个大阴囊的发情浣熊

128
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,460
It's kinda cute.
还真有点可爱哟

129
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Until you get to the scrotum.
只要不看它那玩意儿

130
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,260
What hope do I have for establishing
new relationships given that
我怎么会有希望建立新的友情关系?

131
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:56,630
my current friends apparently could not take
a few hours out of their lives to help me?
现存的朋友们都舍不得用
他们漫长生命的少许小时来帮助我

132
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,510
Sheldon,I'm not going to
defend a big-balled raccoon.
Sheldon 我没打算为大蛋蛋浣熊说话

133
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,890
Well,I don't see how you could.
我看不出你能做到

134
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,810
What I'm trying to say is that maybe you can't
approach this as a purely intellectual exercise.
我想说的是 或许你不能把
这些当作纯粹智力习题来对待

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,540

It occurred to me that you
hadn't returned any of my calls
我想到哈 你没回我的电话

215
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,140
because I hadn't offered any concrete
suggestions for pursuing our friendship.
是因为我没为发展友情提出实际建议

216
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,540
Perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.

Gee,why can't Sheldon make friends?
天呀 Sheldon咋交不到朋友呢?

strikes me as the least objectionable,
好了 Kripke 你刚说那兴趣爱好

You afraid of heights, Cooper?
你恐高啊 Cooper?

251
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,160
Hardly. A fear of heights is illogical.
哪能啊 恐高完全不合理

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,050
A fear of falling, on the other
hand, is prudent and evolutionary.
然而害怕掉下来 才是有发展眼光的说法

What would you say is the minimum altitude I
need to achieve to cement our newfound friendship?
你说要巩固我们的友情

here. Little kids climb this.

So is this your entire job?
Your parents must be so proud.

- 来了 Kripke

258
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,360
Okay,the harness seems to be secure.
好的 绳子貌似很结实

259
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,070
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the Web site said that's to be expected.
刚才有点不能自制
但网上说那是正常情况

260
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,130
this isn't so bad. It's
like vertical swimming.
也不咋难嘛 像是垂直游泳

261
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,490
Hey,look at you,Cooper. You're
almost halfway to the top.
嘿 瞧瞧 Cooper 都爬到一半了

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,820

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,220
I was wrong. It is a fear of heights.
我错了 我恐高

264
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,460
You all right there,Cooper?
你还好吗 Cooper?

265
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,710
Not really.
不太好

266
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,650
I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent
function that's approached an asymptote.
感觉像是反正切曲线接近渐近线了

267
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,020
Are you saying you're stuck?
你是说你卡住了?

268
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,030
What part of inverse tangent function
approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
反正切曲线接近渐近线
哪个字你不明白啊?

269
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,950

not a moron. Just keep going.
我都明白 我又不是白痴 接着爬啦

270
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,860
Yeah,I don't think I can.
我想我做不到

271
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,430
Well,then climb back down.
那就爬下去

272
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,730
No,that doesn't seem any more likely.
不行 更没可能了

273
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,630
What's your plan,Cooper?
你打算咋办 Cooper?

274
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,520
Well,it's not exactly a plan,
but I think I'm going to pass out.
