So, John, you ever been married?

- No.
- Hmm.

Ever been in love?

Well, my feelings were not reciprocated.

Well, that's so sad.

That is a very brave thing

Oh! What the hell?

I wanted to know how your date went,

Doesn't want to know.

Okay, a little less charming.

There's something about him.

STURGIS: So, now we can discuss

433
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:36,058
what the perturbative QCD
corrections to R-bar look like.

434
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,794
So, you can also write it as "R"

435
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,662
divided by the length of "R."

436
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,166
That would be a vector

437
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,504

00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,665

00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,247
to "R."

I'm sorry, where was I?

441
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:58,246
"R" divided by the length of "R."

442
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:01,306
That would be a vector of unit
length parallel to "R."

443
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,318
Oh, yes. Thank you.

444
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,390
So, if you divide "R"
by the length of "R,"

445
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:12,192
that would be a vector...

446
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:15,130

when we divide "R"
by the length of "R,"

00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:34,583
that would be a vector of unit length
