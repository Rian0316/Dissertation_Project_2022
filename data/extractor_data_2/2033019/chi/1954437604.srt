1
00:00:06,742 --> 00:00:07,472
你干嘛呢
What are you doing?

2
00:00:07,472 --> 00:00:10,002
普丽娅一会要跟我用Skype视频
Oh, uh, Priya's calling in a few minutes on Skype,

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:12,172
我们准备共进晚餐
and we are gonna have a dinner date.

4
00:00:14,002 --> 00:00:16,472
现在是孟买时间早上八点
It's 8 o'clock in the morning in Mumbai.

5
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,622
她怎么就吃起晚饭来了
How can she have dinner?

6
00:00:18,632 --> 00:00:19,682
好吧  随你怎么说
Fine, whatever.

7
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:21,062
那普丽娅就吃早餐好了
Priya will be having breakfast.

8
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:24,302
好吧  所以严格来讲你们俩不是共进晚餐
All right, so technically it's not a dinner date.

9
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:27,822
也许你勉强可以把这称为共进早晚餐
I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date.

10
00:00:27,822 --> 00:00:29,902
不过你要是真这么叫的话
But if you did, you'd open yourself

11
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:31,642
你肯定会被别人笑死  人家肯定会说
to peer-based mocking, such as,

12
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:35,192
莱纳德  你昨晚跟普丽娅的早晚餐吃的好吗
"Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"

13
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,562
听起来不像是在笑话我呀
That doesn't sound like mocking.

14
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,032
我还没说完呢
You didn't let me finish.

15
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:41,082
早晚餐
Dinfast.

16
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,152
那是大豆蜡的蜡烛吗
Are those soy-based candles?

17
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,702
不知道  怎么了
I don't know. Why?

18
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:47,622
石蜡蜡烛可能含有致癌物
Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens.

19
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:51,292
当然啦  你要是想吃顿早晚餐
Unless lung cancer is the ambiance

20
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,462
还搭上肺癌的话  我也不拦你
you were going for at your dinfast.

21
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:54,792
早晚餐
Dinfast.

22
00:00:56,342 --> 00:00:57,382
我不想无礼
Listen, I don't want to be rude,

23
00:00:57,382 --> 00:00:59,272
可是普丽娅随时都会打来
but Priya's gonna be calling any minute, so...

24
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:00,862
对哦  普丽娅
Oh, yes, Priya.

25
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:04,862
莱纳德  你知道我从来
Leonard, you know I make a point of

26
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,742
都不干涉你的私事
never interfering in your personal affairs.

27
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:12,822
没错  我也一直很欣赏你这点
Yes, I've always admired that about you.

28
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,252
那是当然
As well you should.

29
00:01:14,252 --> 00:01:16,542
但是我这次要破例了
But I'm going to make an exception here.

30
00:01:16,542 --> 00:01:18,212
又来了
Oh, good.

31
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:22,532
普丽娅回印度去发展自己的法律事业
Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career.

32
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:25,002
你与其花这些时间绝望地挣扎
Instead of desperately trying

33
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,372
费劲心思地保持这段跨洲恋情
to keep this intercontinental relationship alive,

34
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:32,422
你还不如找点别的兴趣爱好呢
you could use that time to take up a hobby.

35
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:34,772
兴趣爱好
A hobby?

36
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:36,112
没错
Yes.

37
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:39,362
我最近得知堪萨斯州一个家伙
I read recently about a fellow in Kansas

38
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:41,952
拿麻绳团了一个巨大的球
with an enormous ball of twine.

39
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:46,832
我认为你可以跟他一比高下
I bet you could give him a run for his money.

40
00:01:47,382 --> 00:01:50,042
你知道吗  有些人可能会说
You know, some people might say that it's great

41
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,272
我们俩保持这种异地恋是精神可嘉的事
that we're trying to make things work long distance.

42
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:53,572
他们会说
They'd say things like,

43
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:56,582
爱情不会被你们俩之间的距离所打败
"Love is stronger than the miles between you".

44
00:01:56,582 --> 00:02:01,332
等有一天我掌权了  我肯定会灭掉这帮人
When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.

45
00:02:02,662 --> 00:02:04,452
你也整天跟艾米视频呀
You video-chat with Amy all the time.

46
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:05,842
咱俩干的事有什么不同
How is this different?

47
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,342
你不喜欢艾米吗
Don't you like Amy?

48
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,122
我当然喜欢艾米啦
Of course I like Amy.

49
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,422
可我不喜欢普丽娅呀
Well, there's the difference.

50
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,962
不好意思  普丽娅打来了
Excuse me, that's Priya.

51
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:17,152
莱纳德
Hi, Leonard.

52
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,152
亲爱的
Hey, honey.

53
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:19,352
我好想你
I miss you.

54
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:20,552
我也好想你
Oh, I miss you, too.

55
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,892
我怀念以前爱情伴侣们
I miss the old days when your romantic partners

56
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,342
能退回录像店的日子
could be returned to the video store.

57
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,454
谢谢你让我待在这
Thanks for letting me stay here

58
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,494
这样我就不用看着莱纳德跟他女朋友视频了
while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.

59
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:34,124
小意思
Oh, it's no problem.

60
00:02:34,124 --> 00:02:35,844
这种感觉还挺不错的呢
It's actually kind of nice.

61
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:37,494
你在看书  我也在看书
You reading, me reading.

62
00:02:37,494 --> 00:02:40,164
咱俩就像一对老夫老妻似的
We're like an old married couple.

63
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,464
咱俩要真是老夫老妻的话
If we were an old married couple,

64
00:02:42,464 --> 00:02:46,124
妻子这个时候就会端上冻柠茶和曲奇饼了
the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.

65
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:50,054
我家没有冻柠茶和曲奇饼
I don't have iced tea and snickerdoodles.

66
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:54,314
尽职的妻子就会去商店买
A good wife would go to the store.

67
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,694
我要离婚
I want a divorce.

68
00:02:58,134 --> 00:02:59,704
很好  你去找律师的路上
Good. On the way to see the lawyer,

69
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:02,194
别忘了买点冻柠茶和曲奇饼
pick up some tea and cookies.

70
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:09,274
我还真得说  我挺喜欢你这张新椅子的
I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.

71
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:10,634
舒服吧
It's great, isn't it?

72
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,644
没错
It is.

73
00:03:11,644 --> 00:03:12,944
符合腰椎曲线
Aligns the lumbar,

74
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,364
支撑住了尾骨  还平衡了臀部
cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks.

75
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:18,784
这椅子还真对得起它的名字
This is a chair worthy of the name.

76
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:19,864
什么名字
What name?

77
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,184
椅子呀
Chair.

78
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:26,994
好吧  你喜欢就好
Oh, all right, well, I'm glad you like it.

79
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:27,904
我还是想不通
I mean, I still can't get over the fact

80
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:29,874
怎么有人就忍心把它给扔了呢
someone just threw it away.

81
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,334
你说什么
What?

82
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:34,784
就是说呀  这椅子就被丢在路上
Yeah, it was just sitting on the street.

83
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,294
我给了个流浪汉十块钱  让他帮我把这张椅子搬上来的
I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.

84
00:03:38,674 --> 00:03:42,644
哦天呐  哦天呐
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

85
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:44,634
你怎么啦
What is wrong?

86
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:47,124
我刚坐在垃圾上了
I've been sitting in garbage!

87
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:49,654
谢尔顿  淡定嘛
Sheldon, take it easy.

88
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,474
你去淡定吧  我得去趟浴室
You take it easy! I need to use your shower.

89
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,564
我当年结婚的时候还是太过乐观了
I went into this marriage with so much hope.

90
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:01,624
浴室地板上有张湿创口贴
There's a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor!

91
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:10,084

生活大爆炸  第五季第二集

100
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:31,561
真有意思
This is fun.

101
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:34,761
我还从来没用过热成型液压机呢
I've never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.

102
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,091
很赞吧
Pretty sweet, huh?

103
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:40,231
这个小玩意儿花了学校十七万五千刀
This little baby set the university back 175 grand.

104
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,281
三分钟到了
That's three minutes.

105
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,181
-让我们看看成果如何  -马上好
- Shall we see what we got?  -Hang on

106
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:50,221
哦也
Oh, yeah.

107
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,581
这真是个有型的三明治
This is one good-looking panini.

108
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,121
把金枪鱼三明治给我
Hand me the tuna melt.

109
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:58,031
-给  -多谢
- Yep.  - Thank you.

110
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,961
你那跨国异地恋怎么样啦
How's it going with the long-distance love affair?

111
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,761
不容易啊  但我俩正在努力
Not easy, but we're making it work.

112
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:14,601
你这句"正在努力"包不包括玩些线上耍流氓啊
When you say "Making it work," does that include doing the cyber nasty?

113
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:15,721
什么
What?

114
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:18,301
你懂的  就是虚拟的很黄很暴力的那种啊
You know, the virtual pickle tickle.

115
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,571
数字化的嘿嘿咻咻
The digital... bow-chicka-bow-bow.

116
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,321
拜托  伙计  你在说我妹啊
Come on, dude. This is my sister you're talking about.

117
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:28,621
喂  对你来说
Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her

118
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:30,941
莱纳德在摄像头里对着她抖那货
 through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with

119
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:32,991
总要好过他当着她的面拿那货戳她吧
than him actually touching her with it.

120
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,801
我没那么猥琐
There's no junk jiggling.

121
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,111
我们就是聊天而已
We just talk.

122
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,971
你疯了吧
Are you sane?

123
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,251
有了高速互联网  你的指尖下
With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips

124
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,911
注: 小手帕是撸sir之友

125
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:42,911
就是继小手帕之后性爱领域的
the greatest advancement in the field of sex

126
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,591
最伟大的进步啊
since the invention of the washcloth.

127
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:48,441
我不能那么做
I can't do that.

128
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,281
好吧  你要是不这么做
Well, if you don't,

129
00:05:50,281 --> 00:05:53,781
你就是把普丽娅拱手让给某个
you're gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban

130
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,701
从小看《印度爱经》插图版长大的头巾男了
who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.

131
00:05:56,701 --> 00:05:59,071
你怎么能这么种族歧视呢
How can you be so racist?

132
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:01,291
拜托  我哪句说错了
Oh, come on, tell me I'm wrong.

133
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,291
莱纳德  很好
Oh, Leonard, good.

134
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,431
找到你了
There you are.

135
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,431
我需要你来检查我头上有没有虱子
I need you to check my head for chair lice.

136
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,251
我昨晚查过了  我不能再犯傻了
I did it last night, I'm not doing it again.

137
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:13,971
没检查别的地儿  对吧
Just his head, right?

138
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:17,441
我不想聊这事儿
I don't want to talk about it.

139
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,141
佩妮椅子上的虫子没跑到你身上
You didn't catch bugs from Penny's chair.

140
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:22,561
不对  有虫子
Yes, I did.

141
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:24,901
现在它们在我的发根毛囊里欢呼雀跃
And now they're cavorting at the base of my hair follicles

142
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,431
就像在红木国家森林公园里跳舞
like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.

143
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,771
谢尔顿  你老是这样
Sheldon, you do this all the time.

144
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:33,911
你总是纠结于某个傻乎乎的想法
You fixate on some crazy idea

145
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:35,711
然后无限制地放大
and then blow it way out of proportion.

146
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:37,911
请举一个例子
Name one time I've ever done that.

147
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,461
比如上次你把GPS追踪器放进垃圾桶里
How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage

148
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,381
就因为你坚信朝鲜间谍
because you were convinced North Korean spies

149
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:47,351
在偷你的草稿纸
were stealing your doodles?

150
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:51,661
还有你坚信是人肉做的鸡块
The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets.

151
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:56,511
还有那朵奇形怪状的在城里老跟踪你的云
The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town.

00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,591
你这配一个  在印度的普莉娅配一个
You have one, Priya has one in India.

305
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:14,861
你只要移动你的嘴唇和舌头
When you move your lips and tongue on yours,

306
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:17,961
就能传输信号  感觉像是你真的在吻她
it transmits exactly what you're doing to hers.

307
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,051
看见没  网络亲吻
See? Internet kissing.

308
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,111
来试试
Give it a try.

309
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:32,171
还是算了
I don't think so.

310
00:15:32,911 --> 00:15:34,121
我来试试
I'll try it.

311
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,951
像这样吗
Like this?

312
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,041
差不多  把你的舌头伸进去
Almost. Really get your tongue in there.

313
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:45,741
激活感应器
to activate the motion sensor.

314
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,801
像这样吗
Like this?

315
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,711
差不多了  要法式舌吻
Close. Really French it.

316
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:00,771
好点了吗
Better?

317
00:16:00,781 --> 00:16:03,181
对  就这样  太正点了
Yeah, you got it, you got it.

318
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:08,601
我震精了  这感觉太逼真了
I'm impressed. This is very lifelike.

319
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,151
擦  你居然咬我舌头
Whoa! You just bit my tongue!

320
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,321
轻咬而已  我只想多点情趣
I-I nibbled. I was being playful.

321
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:18,211
你干嘛要把一切都搞得这么猥琐
Why do you have to make everything weird?

322
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,161
抱歉
Sorry.

323
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:26,421
好点了吗
Better?

324
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,971
正点
Oh, yeah.

325
00:16:34,121 --> 00:16:35,761
很不错哈
Pretty cool, huh?

326
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:38,291
商店里买的话没准要两百块
Probably would cost, like, 200 bucks in a store.

327
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,261
是很划算
I do appreciate a bargain.

328
00:16:40,271 --> 00:16:43,901
我去世的奶奶以前有一套这种家具
This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.

329
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:44,851
不是吧
You're kidding.

330
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:47,071
除了内衣内裤什么都分享了
Everything except bra and panties.

331
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:51,061
维多利亚的秘密  内衣品牌

332
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:51,061
这可是我和维多利亚之间的独家小秘密哟
And they're a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.

333
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,811
而现在是和我了
And now me.

334
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:57,811
对这沙发椅我只有一个问题
I just have one question about the chair.

335
00:16:57,821 --> 00:16:59,201
什么
And what's that?

336
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:02,451
你就不担心这个不卫生吗
Aren't you worried about it being unhygienic?

337
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:06,261
不  完全没有...
No, it's completely fine...

338
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:10,011
我懂了
Hmm. I get it.

339
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:11,061
是谢尔顿
Sheldon sent you.

340
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,281
是他让你来找我
He put you up to this.

341
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,561
-不  他没有  -真的吗
- No, he didn't. - Really?

342
00:17:13,571 --> 00:17:16,531
是的  他有  就是他
Yes, he did. He absolutely did.

343
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:20,081
天啊  艾米  你太不够朋友了
My God, Amy, that's really crappy of you.

344
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,431
真的吗
It is?

345
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,041
当然  你让谢尔顿利用你来操控我
Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me?

346
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,441
我还以为我们是朋友
I thought you were my friend.

347
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:28,121
不  我们是朋友  请别生我气
No, I am your friend. Please don't be mad at me.

348
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,121
我简直难以置信
I can't even believe this.

349
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,781
你最好还是走吧
You know, maybe you should just go.

350
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:32,261
不  对不起  真的很对不起
No! No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

351
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,661
我把刚才的话都收回
I take it all back!

352
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:35,211
看  我坐在你的沙发椅上
Look! I'm, uh, I'm sitting in your chair.

353
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,011
完全没问题
There's nothing wrong with it.

354
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:36,711
这椅子棒极了
It's a great chair.

355
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,481
求你别把我踢出你的生活
Please let me continue to be part of your world.

356
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:42,921
怎么了
What's wrong?

357
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,241
椅子里有什么东西在咬我的臀部
Something in the chair's biting my tushy.

358
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,921
但这无所谓
It's not important. Ow!

359
00:17:46,421 --> 00:17:48,271
快站起来
Wait. Get up, get up!

360
00:17:59,361 --> 00:18:00,831
发誓你不会把这事告诉谢尔顿
Swear you won't tell Sheldon what happened!

361
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
我发誓
I swear!

362
00:18:06,221 --> 00:18:08,951
我能告诉我医生吗  我觉得我得去打针
Can I tell my doctor? I'm probably gonna need shots!

363
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:09,871
当然可以
Yeah, sure!

364
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:19,179
宝贝儿  我觉得我已经懂了
Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.

365
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:20,329
莱纳德  先听我说
Oh, Leonard, listen...

366
00:18:20,329 --> 00:18:21,829
不  你给我听好
No, you listen!

367
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:22,529
你是我的妞
You're my woman,

368
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:26,159
我要给你前所未有的快感
and I'm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.

369
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,649
莱纳德
Leonard...

370
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,979
就是这样  用力叫出我的名字
That's right, say my name...

371
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,199
求我  求我再快点
and beg me for more, 'cause...

372
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,189
我会努力让你达到巅峰
I'm gonna give it to you.

373
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,539
我父母在旁边
My parents are here.

374
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,039
你好  莱纳德
Hello, Leonard...

375
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,749
我也能咬牙切齿用力喊你的名字吗
if I may also say your name.

376
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,719
看呀  从天而降的沙发椅
Check it out. Free chair.

377
00:18:53,719 --> 00:18:55,169
可不是
Yeah.

378
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:58,439
要是谢尔顿和莱纳德的公寓里有个沙发椅
Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard's apartment,

379
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:00,579
我就不用老是坐在地板上了
I wouldn't wind up sitting on the floor all the time.

380
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,649
来吗
On three?

381
00:19:05,189 --> 00:19:07,349
-一二三  -抬
- Three! - Three!

382
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:11,749
哪个二货舍得扔掉这么好的沙发椅哟
What kind of idiot throws away
