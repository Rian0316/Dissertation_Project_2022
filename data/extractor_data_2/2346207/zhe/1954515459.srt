1
00:00:02,928 --> 00:00:04,261
你自个住得咋样
So, how's living alone?

2
00:00:04,477 --> 00:00:05,677
你懂得 很有意思
You know, it's interesting.

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,812
刚刚搬进新公寓的时候
When I first moved into my new apartment,

4
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:09,347
我有点紧张
I was nervous.

5
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:13,234
人生中第一次没有了室友
For the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate.

6
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,903
但是 哥突然醒悟了
But then it hit me:

7
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,174
哥人生中第一次木有室友呢
for the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate!

8
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:25,229
要是哥想裸着 没人管呀
If I want to walk around naked, nobody cares.

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:27,081
要是哥想把洗衣篮放在客厅里
If I want to leave the laundry basket

10
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:31,119
没人在乎呀
in the middle of the living room, nobody stops me.

11
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:33,171
要是哥买的点汤在冰箱里放两天
If I bring home soup from the deli

12
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:36,240
没人抢呀
and leave it in the fridge for two days, nobody eats it.

13
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:39,177
要是哥做了什么傻了吧唧的事儿
And if I do something colossally stupid,

14
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,579
没人知道呀
nobody ever has to know.

15
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:46,885
人们总是爱嘲笑那些
People make fun of the guy

16
00:00:46,887 --> 00:00:49,304
整晚呆在家无所事事的人
who stays home every night doing nothing.

17
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:53,291
但事实上 那些人是天才
But the truth is... that guy's a genius.

18
00:00:53,293 --> 00:00:56,594
老实说 一个人看着电视 
Because let's be honest, sitting around watching TV,

19
00:00:56,596 --> 00:00:59,430
喝着小酒 吃着炸排骨
drinking beer and eating ribs alone is what every

20
00:00:59,432 --> 00:01:04,385
简直就是每个美国公民都渴望的生活
red-blooded American would rather be doing at all times.

21
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:08,072
但是有人和你一起分享不是更好吗
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better to have someone to share the...

22
00:01:08,074 --> 00:01:11,492
我是说 你不会觉得有点孤独么
I mean, don't you get lonely without...

23
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:13,611
好吧 听起来确实很爽
Yeah, that sounds pretty great.

我们折腾了很久才预定到位子
We've been trying forever to get this reservation.

00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:09,517
能等等么
Can you hold on for just one second?

52
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,885

00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:12,053
没有啊
Nothing.

54

没有
No.

56
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:17,308
好吧 姐得去尿尿了

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,194
靠 这小屁孩最好给老娘长得可爱点
Man, this kid better be real freakin' cute!

58
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:23,898
怎么了
What was that all about?

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,867
莉莉昨晚上做了个春梦
Lily had a sex dream last night.

60
00:02:27,186 --> 00:02:28,653
春梦吗 给哥说说
Sex dream? Do tell.

61
00:02:28,655 --> 00:02:32,189
我正在给宝宝用的家具上漆
I was painting the baby furniture...

62
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:35,910
噢耶
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:35,912 --> 00:02:39,130
噢耶
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:39,132 --> 00:02:41,582
快点啊 马修快回家了
Hurry up, before Marshall gets home.

65
00:02:41,584 --> 00:02:43,751
噢 
Oh, oh...

66
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,424
哇唔
Whoa!

67
00:02:49,426 --> 00:02:50,425
宝贝 真抱歉
I'm sorry, baby.

68
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:51,993
你睡着了吗
Were you asleep?

69
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:54,479
所有怀孕的女人都会做疯狂的春梦
All pregnant ladies have crazy sex dreams.

70
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,265
那只是荷尔蒙作祟啦
It's just her hormones going berserk.

71
00:02:57,267 --> 00:02:59,901
那这次谁是她的春梦对象呢
So who's responsible for her rapid thigh movement this time?

72
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,936
我喜欢那个她上了乔治・华盛顿的梦
Oh, my favorite was when she banged George Washington.

73
00:03:01,938 --> 00:03:03,796
我更喜欢那个她和比尔・考斯比
I liked the three-way with

74
00:03:03,797 --> 00:03:05,389
还有蓝爸爸一起玩双飞的梦
Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.

75
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:07,775
噢 蓝爸爸把她咔咔得都咔咔了
Oh, he smurfed the smurf out of her.

76
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,577
对啊 考斯比只好一个人默默在角落咔咔咔
Yes, while The Cos smurfed off in the corner.

77
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:11,529
我们都记得这个梦 说正事
We all remember. But here's the thing.

78
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:14,899
当莉莉做春梦的时候
When Lily has dirty dreams about other people,

79
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,617
她都会告诉我她的春梦对象
she always tells me.

80
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:17,935
但是这次
But this time...

81
00:03:17,937 --> 00:03:21,923
听起来好像你做了个怪梦
Sounds like you had a crazy dream.

82
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,425
梦见啥了
What was it about?

83
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:30,014
然后她的脸变成了
And then her face turned...

84
00:03:30,016 --> 00:03:32,683
朱砂红
vermilion.

85
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:37,088
就是 你和我
Just... you and me...

86
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,024
滚床单啦 一对一
gettin' it on, monogamously.

87
00:03:40,993 --> 00:03:45,696
爽歪歪了
Monoga-me-oh-my.

88
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:48,766
不是小尴尬时的那种玫瑰红
Not the rose quartz of the slightly embarrassed,

89
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:51,652
也不是有点窘时的那种番茄红
or the tomato red of the mildly abashed,

90
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:55,406
而是朱砂红 那种淫荡的羞愧色
vermilion, the color of carnal shame.

91
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:59,460
这就意味着一件事
Can only mean one thing:

92
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,963
莉莉在梦里上了一个我们都认识的人
Lily dream-banged someone we know.

93
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,549
好吧 你真相了 
Okay, you caught me vermilion-handed.

94
00:04:04,551 --> 00:04:07,969
哥花了五年的时间
The truth is, I've spent the last five years

95
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,671
inception暗指盗梦空间

96
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,671
试图进到你媳妇的梦中
trying to inception your wife.

97
00:04:10,673 --> 00:04:12,757
那部电影是两年前出的呀
That movie only came out two years ago.

98
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,809
什么电影
What movie?

99
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,761
你知道哥猜是谁吗
You know who I bet it is?

100
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:18,346
罗宾
Robin.

101
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,231
不是她 哥证实过了
Already checked.

102
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:21,682
莉莉和我去
Lily and I paid her a visit

103
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,851
环球新闻台总部找过她一次
at the new World Wide News headquarters.

104
00:04:23,853 --> 00:04:25,820
我太激动了  因为我花了好几个月
And I'm so excited, because I've been trying months

105
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:26,804
才订到这个餐厅的位子
to get this reservation.

106
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:28,189
不好意思耽搁一秒钟
Can you hold on just one second?

107
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,440
你到底想干什么
What the hell are you doing?!

108
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,525
啥也没干啊
Nothing.

109
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:32,743
照片很棒    哦
Nice photo. Oh.

110
00:04:32,745 --> 00:04:34,779
你的护照应该超级大吧
Your passport must be enormous.

111
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:36,414
啊呵呵
Ugh.

112
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:39,984
这个吧 老实说 我不想要这东西
You know, for the record, I didn't want this.

113
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:42,286
本意不想要 有了也不认可哦
Didn't want it, did not approve it.

114
00:04:43,373 --> 00:04:44,839
简直太让人难堪了嘛
It's super embarrassing.

115
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:47,158
嘿   莫尔
Hey, merle

116
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,611
哦   对了  你们想去看看我的办公桌吗
So, uh, do you guys want to come up and see my desk?

117
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:51,879
当然   干嘛不   
Yeah, why not?

118
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,431
来
Come on.

119
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:54,932
证件
I.D.?

120
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:56,834
哦    嗯    那个就是我
Oh. Um, that is me.

121
00:04:58,221 --> 00:04:59,336
女士    恕我冒昧
Ma'am, with all due respect,

122
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,639
你比那个辣妹要老上那么一点点
you're a wee bit older than that hottie.

123
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:03,858
我的老天哪
For God sakes.

124
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,311
你瞧瞧  我每天都在国家电视台亮相
You know, here I am, on national TV every day,

125
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:10,781
结果一个在我巨幅照旁边坐了一辈子的人
and still a guy who spends his whole life sitting next to

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,151
居然不知道我是谁
a giant picture of me has no idea who I am.

127
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,403
我才没有在这里坐一辈子  我可是玩乐队的
This isn't my whole life; I'm in a band.

128
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,671
而且我们会飞黄腾达的
And we're gonna make it.

129
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:18,906
孩子们   他们确实飞黄腾达了
And, kids, they did make it.

130
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,275
那件事我以后再细说
But I'll get to that later.

131
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,045
那个其实吧   我以后很可能不会细说
You know what, I'm probably not going to get to that later.

132
00:05:24,047 --> 00:05:27,715
他们出过一曲  不算太逊  仅此而已
They had one song, it didn't suck, the end.

133
00:05:27,717 --> 00:05:30,251
你不是总说出不出名并不重要
You always said it wasn't about being famous.

134
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:32,703
你只是想踏踏实实做新闻   对吗
You just want to do solid journalism, right?

135
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:34,305
没错   嗯
Yeah, well...

136
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,507
我当然想出名啦
Of course I want to be famous!

137
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:37,875
在加拿大   我可是罗宾亮晶晶
In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles.

138
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,060
我的名字家喻屋晓（加拿大人多住木屋）
I was a cabinhold name.

139
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,161
可在这儿
But here?

140
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,512
不用看你证件   莫尔
Don't need to see your I.D., Merle.

141
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:43,181
所有人都认识你
Everyone knows who you are.

142
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,482
你是莫尔
You're Merle.

143
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:46,484
他只在圣诞派对的滑稽短剧里出现过一次
He was in one skit in the Christmas party!

144
00:05:47,854 --> 00:05:50,221
哦   对了   泰德最近怎么样
Uh, by the way, how is Ted doing?

145
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:52,006
孩子们    你们还记的发生了什么事吗
Kids, you remember what happened.

146
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,108
我向她表白    被她拒绝
I declared my love, she turned me down,

147
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,827
我们都搬出了公寓    现在
we both moved out of the apartment, and now...

148
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,363
我好久没和他说话了  自从我们  没再说话了
I haven't talked to him since we... stopped talking.

149
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,533
他过的不错
He's pretty good.

150
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:03,784
不错
Pretty good?

151
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:06,153
昨天晚上 你只穿着白色小内内
Last night, you ate a box of Froot Loops

152
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,255
吃光了一盒麦片
in your tighty whities.

153
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:10,258
不对  我神马都没穿 
No, I demolished a box of Froot Loops,

154
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,010
狂吞了一盒之麦片
fully nude.

155
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,429
对    是还"不错"
Yeah, "Pretty good" Works.

156
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:17,598
嗨    巴尼
Hey, Barney.

157
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,767
嗨    莉莉
Hey, Lily.

158
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:25,223
你知道这是怎么回事吗
Do you know what this is about?

159
00:06:25,225 --> 00:06:25,890
啊哈
Uh-huh.

160
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:27,108
我需要知道吗
Do I want to know?

161
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:29,093
不好意思    不是你   哥们
No, sorry, bro.

162
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,311
大爷的
Damn it!

163
00:06:30,313 --> 00:06:31,762
好    该我的事迹了
Okay, time for my stuff.

164
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,981
哥几个    昨晚上我坐在家里
Guys, I was sitting at home last night,

165
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,617
忽然间    我感到了醒湖灌顶
and all of a sudden, I had a piphany.

166
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:37,985
我的醒湖灌顶就是这个
And my piphany was this...

167
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:39,820
实际上  那个  那个应该叫"醍醐灌顶"
Actually, it's, uh, it's "Epiphany."

168
00:06:39,822 --> 00:06:42,456
错  泰德 你是醍醐   我是醒湖
No, Ted, this is the piphany.

169
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,824
我这就说出来了
And here it is:

170
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:48,129
让  每个  夜晚  成为传奇
Make... every... night... legendary.

171
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,664
哥几个    我们有过
Guys, we've had

172
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,415
一些相当传奇的夜晚
some pretty legendary nights.

173
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:53,834
但是我们也曾有过一些不那么传奇的夜晚
But we've also had some nights that weren't so legendary.

174
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:57,004
比如泰德逼大家去看"我老婆是巨无霸"的那天
Lookin' at you, The Night Ted Made Us All Watch Norbit.

175
00:06:57,006 --> 00:06:59,757
艾迪・墨菲演的肥妻    这还有问题啊
Eddie Murphy as a fat lady; what's the problem?

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,392
那个是艾迪 墨菲演的
That was Eddie Murphy?

177
00:07:01,394 --> 00:07:03,394
不传奇的夜晚从此不再
The non-legendary nights are done.

178
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:06,480
从现在开始    我们今后每一个夜晚
From here on in, every single night of our lives

179
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,632
都会成为永生难忘的夜晚
will be a night we'll never forget.

180
00:07:08,634 --> 00:07:10,685
从今夜开始
Starting tonight.

181
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:14,638
迄今最悠久疯狂的历险 谁准备好了
Who's ready for the longest, craziest adventure yet?!

182
00:07:15,825 --> 00:07:17,491
很好
Good.

183
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:19,977
我们团队中的弱者已经被淘汰了
The weak have been weeded from our herd.

184
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,862
你准备好去狂欢了吗    泰德
You ready to rock and roll, Ted?

185
00:07:21,864 --> 00:07:23,147
那个    我也要回家了
Yeah, I'm going home, too.

186
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:24,715
我预感到可能要出什么奇装异服的幺蛾子
I'm sensing some costumes coming up here

187
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:25,866
我还是眼不见为净
and I'd rather steer clear.

188
00:07:25,868 --> 00:07:28,235
泰德    20年以后
Ted, 20 years from now,

189
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,421
当你是个老光棍而我是美国总统的时候
when you're all alone and I'm President,

190
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:31,539
你的回忆的内容不应该是
you're not gonna remember

191
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,541
泡在公寓里无所事事
sitting around your apartment doing nothing.

192
00:07:33,543 --> 00:07:35,843
你将会回想起这个夜晚
What you will remember is that tonight,

193
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:38,245

难忘之夜
Memorable night.

198
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,180
这个和明晚相比微不足道啊    兄弟
That was nothing compared to ma?ana, amigo.

199
00:07:56,182 --> 00:07:58,232
因为明晚将会成为
Because ma?ana is gonna be...

200
00:07:58,234 --> 00:08:00,684

Why not, Ranjit?

00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:51,503
你不总是想怎样就怎样么
Don't you always just take whatever you want,

217
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,405
为了满足你那些个肮脏 变态 扭曲
regardless of anything but your own

218
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,958
的欲望可以不顾一切
dirty, sick, twisted appetites?

219
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:02,497
我还是继续走百老汇吧
I'll stay on Broadway.

好的 很好 那个梦里你梦到了什么
Okay, well, what happened in this dream?

Marshall, it was a dream.

哦 是么 
Yeah, well, dreams are just stuff

284
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:34,232
梦是心头想
that you subconsciously want to happen.

285
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,867
要不然你认为我怎么会梦到
Why do you think I'm constantly dreaming

因为你是看着那幅画睡着的
Because you fall asleep looking at a painting of it.

288

别转移话题
Don't try to change the subject.

290
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,828
你在梦里出轨
You sleep-cheated.

291
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,946
你在梦里到处和人睡
You've been sleep-sleeping around,

292
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:50,131
我难以接受啊
and I'm sick of it.

293
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,583
你知道么 我现在有直接下车
You know, I have half a mind

294
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,635
让你一个人去吃那该死的晚餐的念头
to get out and let you eat all by yourself.

295

我们今晚会去偷一头骆驼
it's the night we stole a camel...

302
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:13,855
这意味着今晚将会充满戏剧--性的
...which means it'll be full of drama-- dary.

303
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:15,823
和前面"戏剧性"的谐音

304
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:15,823
充满了单峰骆驼
Dromedary!

305
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:18,007
我为你神一般的造词能力鼓掌 
I applaud your wordplay

306
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:19,410
但是你把前提搞错了
but your core premise is flawed.

307
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:21,579
夜夜传奇是不可能的
Every night can't be legendary.

308
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,116
如果每个晚上都如此传奇 那么就没有传奇之夜了
If all nights are legendary, no nights are legendary.

309
00:12:25,118 --> 00:12:28,403
泰德 你看你摆得什么态度
See, Ted, that attitude right there,

310
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:30,104
那就是为何我领先于你
that's why I'm in the lead.

311
00:12:30,106 --> 00:12:31,456
你的领先什么意思
What do you mean, in the lead?

312
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,324
我说的是游戏人生啊 泰德童鞋
I'm talking about the game of life, Ted.

313
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:34,459
计分板
Scoreboard.

314
00:12:34,461 --> 00:12:36,511
更好的衣装75点
Better wardrobe: 75 points.

315
00:12:36,513 --> 00:12:39,047
公寓的楼层比你高 90点
Apartment on a higher floor: 90 points.

316
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,733
名字比你长一点 110点
Longer name: 110 points.

317
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:43,801
插一句 这套点数规则是你定的吗
Sorry. Did you just make up this point system?

318
00:12:43,803 --> 00:12:46,070
制定点数规则 114点
Made up the point system: 114 points.

319
00:12:46,072 --> 00:12:48,172
既然你指出这一点 就赏你10点好了
And ten points to you for pointing that out.

320
00:12:48,174 --> 00:12:49,507
不错哟 泰德
Nice job, Ted.

321
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,593
足够大方到会赏你这10点
15 points to me for being gracious enough

322
00:12:51,595 --> 00:12:52,961
就给自己个15点好了
to give you those ten points.

323
00:12:52,963 --> 00:12:54,195
但是有一点 泰德
But here's the point, Ted.

324
00:12:54,197 --> 00:12:55,363
每次我出去逍遥
Every time I go out

325
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,581
缔造传奇夜晚
and have an awesome night

326
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,715
而且你却没来
and you're not there,

327
00:12:57,717 --> 00:12:59,350
我这栏里又多了100点的说
that's another 100 points in my column.

328
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:01,419
于是乎我领先了
So yeah, I'm in the lead.

329
00:13:01,421 --> 00:13:04,205
巴尼 回家过夜这一事实
Barney, the fact that I can stay home for a night

330
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,524
证明我内心平和
shows that I have inner peace

331
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:08,576
而且我觉得没必要去争这个点那个点的
and that I don't feel the need to keep score.

332
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,244
这就差不多值个1000点了吧
That's worth like 1,000 points right there,

333
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:12,914
所以说句良心话 我们打平
so at the very least, we're tied.

334
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,799
我们才不是平手好伐
We're so not tied.

335
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,234
Tie既有打平又有系紧的意思

336
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,234
尽管你知道什么东西是系紧的
Although you know what is tied--

337
00:13:16,236 --> 00:13:18,503
我女朋友的比基尼上的衣带
the strap of my girlfriend's bikini.

338
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,505
但有时是松的 因为她是脱衣舞娘
Except when it's not, 'cause she's a stripper.

339
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:22,206
一百万点 游戏结束
One million points! Game.

340
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,641
嘘
Shh.

341
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:24,726
结束了
It's over.

342
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,694
都过去了 过去了
It's done. It's done.

343
00:13:28,147 --> 00:13:30,047
喂 你是做什么的
So what do you do?

344
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,382
你开玩笑的对吧
You're kidding, right?

345
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:33,184
我是前方记者
I... I'm an on-air reporter.

346
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,486
我五分钟前才做过一篇报道
I just did a report like five minutes ago.

347
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:37,221
你听起来很挫败啊
You sound frustrated.

348
00:13:37,223 --> 00:13:38,556
没错
Yeah, I am.

349
00:13:38,558 --> 00:13:42,560
我累死累活 而且和以前一样 没人把我当回事
I'm busting my ass, and as usual, no recognition.

350
00:13:42,562 --> 00:13:45,663
罗宾 我干这行也有段时间了
Robin, I've been doing this a while,

351
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:48,166
如果有什么东西我学到的 就是咕噜
and if there's one thing I've learned, it's flarm.

352
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,284
什么咕噜
What? Flarm.

353
00:13:50,286 --> 00:13:52,236
咕噜咕噜咕噜
Flarm, flarm, flarm.

354
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:53,788
叽里呱啦
Blobbum.

355
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,673
你出啥毛病了
What is wrong with you?

356
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,291
你中风了还是什么
Are you having a stroke?

357
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,076
事实上 他就是中风了
As a matter of fact, he was.

358
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:00,795
喂 挺住啊 等会儿
Oh! Hold on! Wait!

359
00:14:00,797 --> 00:14:02,196
与此同时 莉莉非常
Meanwhile, Lily was in

360
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:04,382
急切的需要一位女性朋友
desperate need of a female friend.

361
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:06,351
莉莉 这我都见了无数遍了
Lily, I have seen this a million times.

362
00:14:06,353 --> 00:14:08,886
孩子要出生了 男人都会不正常的
Guys go crazy when there's a baby on the way.

363
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:11,255
你应该知道我们经理在他老婆怀孕时的样子吧
You should have seen the manager when his wife got pregnant.

364
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:14,892
怀孕七个月时 他就不让她继续当脱衣舞娘了
After the second trimester, he made her stop stripping.

365
00:14:14,894 --> 00:14:17,228
嗯 你说的很对
Yeah, you're right.

366
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,780
我觉得很愧疚
Now I feel bad.

367
00:14:18,782 --> 00:14:20,264
我们的晚餐一定是毁了
Our big dinner's been ruined.

368
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,784
马修现在多半在哭呢
Marshall's probably crying right now.

369
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:25,536
我不知道这里的食物会如此美味
I had no idea that food could be this delicious.

370
00:14:25,538 --> 00:14:28,606
马修 你现在很不正常
Marshall, you are being crazy.

371
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,608
没有没有 我搞的定
No, no, I can handle it.

372
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,942
如果我把我的本本卖了
If I sell my laptop,

373
00:14:31,944 --> 00:14:34,746
我们可以再吃一次这些南瓜花
we can get seconds on those squash blossoms.

374
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,130
我说的是莉莉
I mean about Lily.

375
00:14:36,132 --> 00:14:39,500
嗯 你知道的 她现在也不正常
Well, you know, she's being crazy, too.

376
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:40,618
她怀孕了
She's pregnant.

377
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,053
她就应该不正常
She gets to be crazy.

378
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,055
而你应该是正常的那个
You have to be the sane one.

379
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,890
怎么 在孩子出生之前我再也不能
So what, I don't get to be crazy again

380
00:14:45,892 --> 00:14:47,124
表现得不正常了吗
until the baby comes?

381
00:14:47,126 --> 00:14:50,261
当然不能 接下来就该轮到小宝宝不正常了
No. Then it's baby's turn to be crazy.

382
00:14:50,263 --> 00:14:52,963
那我什么时候可以再不正常一下
When do I get to be crazy again?

383
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,465
不可能了
Never.

384
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:58,463
少年狂笑中

385
00:14:59,405 --> 00:15:01,072
我们完全打平了
We are totally even.

386
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,191
我们绝对不是平手 原因如下
We absolutely are not even, and here's why.

387
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,742
就算加上你
I'll grant you that if you include

388
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:07,278
设计摩天楼的12分
the 12 points for designing the skyscraper,

389
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,580
和汤米・李击掌的83分
the 83 points for slapping five with Tommy Lee

390
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,633
还有比我先泡到罗宾的9000分
and the 9,000 points for banging Robin before me,

391
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,303
我们也才刚好并驾齐驱
our point totals would be about neck and neck,

392
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,205
但是有件事情你忘记了
but there's one thing you're forgetting.

393
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,456
我不在乎的这个事实
The fact that I don't care?

394
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,807
不
No.

395
00:15:19,809 --> 00:15:22,310
而且你因为顶嘴再扣掉5点
And you just lost five points for sass.

396
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:26,297
你记得我们三年前的一段对话吗
Do you remember a conversation we had about three years ago?

397
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,716
巴尼 你是王
Barney, you're the king.

398
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,268
没有人可以做到像你一样泡到妞
Nobody picks up chicks like you.

399
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,519
你真是 英俊
You're handsome,

400
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:33,354
令人愉悦
debonair,

401
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,440
一切我希望成为的东西
everything I wish I could be.

402
00:15:35,442 --> 00:15:37,141
我怎么觉得这事儿从来没有发生过
I'm starting to think this never happened.

403
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:39,160
让你自己说完
Let you finish.

404
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:41,679
你舌灿莲花 魅力四射
You're smooth, charismatic,

405
00:15:41,681 --> 00:15:42,647
温伦尔雅
"Sauve."

406
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:44,148
你是说温文尔雅吧
I think you mean "Suave."

407
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,383
啊哈
Aha.

408
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:47,535
这么说你确实记得
So you do remember.

409
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,820
但是有一件事
But there's one thing

410
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,689
即便是像你一样的泡妞大神也是做不了的
even a master ladies' man like you could never do,

411
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,291
如果你能做的话
and if you could ever do it,

412
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:55,293
这件事值500点
it would be worth 500 points.

413
00:15:55,295 --> 00:15:59,080
你勾起我的兴趣了 比我矮一点的小朋友
You have my attention, my slightly shorter friend.

414
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:00,665
挑战如下
Here's the challenge.

415
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:04,819
穿着裙子要来一个女孩子的电话号码
Get a girl's phone number while you're wearing a dress.

416
00:16:06,672 --> 00:16:09,390
挑战...
Challenge...

417
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,092
完成
Accomplished.

418
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:12,176
没错
That's right.

419
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,845
去年 我套上裙子
Last year, I slapped on a dress,

420
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,713
就在这个酒吧里转了转
took a few laps around this very bar,

421
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:17,215
然后我就拿到了
and I got this:

422
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:19,884
一个叫斯蒂芬妮・麦克罗根妞儿的电话号码
the phone number of one Stephanie McColgan.

423
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:23,053
就在那晚 我脱下我的裤袜
Later that night, I took off my pantyhose,

424
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,740
接着在她的小裤裤里...留下我的痕迹
and gave her panties... my hose.

425
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:27,057
没错 泰德
That's right, Ted.

426
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:29,360
哥已经领先500点了
I am 500 points ahead.

427
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,329
除非你能穿着裙子拿到一个女生的电话号码
Until you can get a girl's digits

428
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:34,899
否则我们永远不会打平的
while wearing a dress, you and I will never be even.

429
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:36,834
你知道吗 公寓管理员可能正等着我
You know what? The super's probably waiting for me,

430
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:38,619
而且我刚想起来 我还有一把备用钥匙
and I just remembered there's a spare key

431
00:16:38,621 --> 00:16:40,371
-藏在脚垫下面 晚安了 -等等 等等
under the doormat, so good night. Wait, wait.

432
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,739
-泰德你别走啊 -巴尼 我要走了
Ted, don't go. Barney, I am leaving.

433
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,875
恐怕今晚还是将要淡出记忆
I'm afraid this is just one of those nights

434
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,510
的平凡一夜
we're probably going to forget.

435
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:47,378
我不这么想 哥们 你看
I don't think so, dude. Look.

436
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,963
如果你在关注我们的话 
If you're just joining us, the World Wide News

437
00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:51,582
环球新闻台的天空之眼直升机在曼哈顿上空失控
Eye in the Sky traffic chopper is out of control over Manhattan

438
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:53,651
而此直升机正由本台的罗宾・舍巴斯基驾驶
and being piloted by our own Robin Scherbatsky.

439
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,853
结局恐怕不妙
This probably won't end well.

440
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:01,066
孩子们  纽约时不时会有那样一个时刻
Kids, every now and then, New York has a moment

441
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,187
每一个市民都关注着同一件事情
when every eye in the city is watching the same thing.

442
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,289
这就是那样的时刻
This was one of those moments.

443
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,142
我们都屏气凝神关注着
We all watched breathlessly as the pilot on the ground

444
00:17:09,144 --> 00:17:11,962
罗宾听从地面上驾驶员的指示 克服重重困难
told her what to do, and against all odds,

445
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,632
把那架直升机降落在地面上
your Aunt Robin landed that helicopter.

446
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:19,002
我成功了
I did it.

447
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:21,421
我成功了
I did it!

448
00:17:28,996 --> 00:17:31,097
飞行员也同时获救 不久痊愈
The pilot survived and made a full recovery.

449
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:32,465
至于罗宾
And Robin?

450
00:17:32,467 --> 00:17:34,734
同志们 那是罗宾・舍巴斯基

如果我不做些让自己分心的事情……
