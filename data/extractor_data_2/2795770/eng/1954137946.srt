00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:02,660
[Ted Narrating] In 1994...

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:05,967
Robin's dad took her
to New York City for the first time.

3
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:07,700
This is amazing! Thank you, sir.

4
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:11,039
Well, a little father-son
bonding trip never hurt anyone.

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:15,070
I did almost die from malnutrition
on that wolf hunt last year.

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:18,379
I had to almost kill you
for you to learn how to kill.

7
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,286
New York City's the best, eh?

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,721
I despise it. It's like Edmonton,
minus the arts and culture.

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,624
- Come on. We'll miss our flight.
- I'll catch up.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,255
One day I'm gonna move here...

11
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,665
marry a sophisticated big-city man...

12
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:40,138
with a sick mullet, like, all the way
down to his shoulder pads.

13
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,004
And at night, he'll let me brush it.

14
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,935
And I'll dig up this locket...

15
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,482
so it can be my "something old"
at our wedding.

16
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,315
[Father]
R.J.

17
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,218
[Deep Voice] Coming, sir.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,315
[Whispers]
I'll be back for you.

19
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,497
Back then, I was too embarrassed
to tell you I'd done that.

20
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,532
But we're closer now.

21
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,126
I feel like I don't have to hide my feminine side
anymore just because you've always wanted a...

22
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,068
Son! Yeah. It's Barney.

23
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,605
Great.

24
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:16,073
I'll be there in 15, B-dog.

25
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:18,042
Woof, woof.

26
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:22,308
- That's our thing.
- Uh, be where in 15?

27
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,180
Laser tag. Never been.
B-dog's gonna teach me.

28
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,687
Look. I think that it's great
that you and Barney are...

29
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,382
B-dog.

30
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,516
B-dog are bonding...

31
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,958
but, um, you agreed to help me with this.

32
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:38,293
Fine. Where did you bury this tampon?

33
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:41,891
- It's a locket.
- I'm sorry. I get all these girlie things confused.

34
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:44,867
Do you need my help or not?

35
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,306
Nah, it's stupid.

36
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,103
[Father Chuckles]

37
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,701
[Ted Narrating] So, while Robin
searched for her "something old'...

38
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,213
Lily and Marshall packed
for their "something new"...

39
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,045
Lily's yearlong
art consultant gig in Italy.

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,212
I still can't believe we have
to say good-bye to this place.

41
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,050
Oh, I know, baby.

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,785
But look at it as an excuse
to simplify our lives.

43
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,657
We can't bring everything to Italy,
so we gotta throw out some junk.

44
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:11,219
For example, look.

45
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,664
My old Sasquatch binders that
I could never throw away...

46
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:18,465
because I was gonna be the guy
who proved the existence of Bigfoot.

47
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,735
These are obviously coming to Italy.
But these handbags? Gonzo.

48
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,833
No way.

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,140
These have sentimental meaning to me.

50
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,009
Didn't you shoplift these in your 20s?

51
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:30,641
Yes, and I get very nostalgic
for that time.

52
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,380
You get older. You have kids.
You stop stealing. It's sad.

53
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,388
Lily, we just don't have room for these.

54
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,550
Oh, but you get to keep
your Bigfoot binders?

55
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,494
Wait. Why is this one just December 1999?

56
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,428
Oh. Y2K was coming.

57
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,898
A lot of people took to the woods...

58
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,332
saw the truth.

59
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:55,363
Okay, Marshall, we don't have time to argue
over what stays and what goes.

60
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:57,534
Ooh, you know who we gotta bring in?

61
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,411
Okay, I agree he is good at this stuff,
but he just gets so cocky.

62
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,540
No, he doesn't.

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,117
So I heard you guys have a bit of a...
packing situation.

64
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,422
I acknowledge now this was a mistake.

65
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,657
Look. I came here to chew bubble gum
and pack boxes...

66
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,164
and I'm all out of bubble gum.
[Gags]

67
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,394
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

68
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:24,527
I swallowed it.

69
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,538
Is that bad?

70
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:27,971
Good. Thank you.

71
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,872
Dr. Goldsmith says I should be fine.

72
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,468
I just have to look for it in my stool.

73
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,139
So, as I was saying...

74
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,618
I heard you guys have a bit of a...
packing situation.

78
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:54,665
Now, as you know...

79
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,635
I'm a bit of a legend
when it comes to packing.

80
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,331
[Together] We know.

81
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,466
Tales are still told of the time
I traveled all through Mexico...

82
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:06,941
for two weeks...

83
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,573
with everything I needed...

84
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,586
efficiently packed
into a hands-free belt satchel.

85
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,918
The locals called me...

86
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,790
d El Ganso con la Riñoneral d

87
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,422
It's not a hands-free belt satchel, Ted.

88
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:26,658
It's a fanny pack.

89
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,462
It's not a fanny pack!

90
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:29,796
Ted, in Spanish...

91
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,336
"el Ganso con la Riñonera'...

92
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,735
means "Fanny Pack Dork."

93
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,363
No, it doesn't. It means...

94
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,068
"Packer of Great Skill and Merit."

95
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,544
[Ted Narrating] I looked it up.
It means "Fanny Pack Dork."

96
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,912
And as a packer
of great skill and merit...

97
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,884
I will tell you how to pack
with Tetris-like precision.

98
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,387
We get it. You pack a lot in your fanny.

99
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,423
Obvious, yet delightful.

100
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,425
Okay. I got a big interview at 3:00...

101
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,173
about possibly designing another building.

102
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,822
Until then, if you abide by my rulings...

103
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:00,388
I will tell you what goes to Italy...

104
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,697
and what goes in... the Triangle.

105
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,761
[Ted Narrating]
Kids, as you know...

106
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:09,774
the Bermuda Triangle was the name we gave
to the curb right outside our apartment...

107
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:13,835
which possessed the magical ability
to make any item disappear...

108
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,403
instantly.

109
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,642
The biggest rule for de-cluttering is...

110
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:20,652
"Have you used it in the last year?"

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,156
If not, Triangle.

112
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,987
Have you used this jump rope
in the last year?

113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,858
[Scoffs] Are you kidding?
I hop threads every morning, son.

114
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,920
Do three in a row, and you can keep it.

115
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,992
Well played, Mosby.

116
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,230
Next.

117
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,667
Have you used it in the last year?

118
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:45,438
Gee, I can't remember.

119
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,681
Are you trying to bribe me?

120
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,218
I don't know what you're talking about.
[Coughs] Take it.

121
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,311
- Triangle!
- [Groans]

122
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,946

- Ha-ha!

124
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,558
Wow. You're a natural, Dad.

125
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,564
You know, I love Robin.
And her sister's okay, I guess.

126
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:11,467
But there's something nice
about finally having... a son.

127
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,095

Now I'll admit, to the untrained eye...

134
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,924
a few of my packing rulings
may have seemed arbitrary.

135
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:36,393
Let's Go Italy? Triangle.

136
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,589
Triangle. Let's go Italy.

137
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,858
A gorilla suit and a blonde wig.

138
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:44,994
Have you used either of these
in the last year?

00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,770

[Both Moaning]

142
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,929
- Nope, haven't used those.
- I don't think those even belong to us.

143
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,176
Okay. Here's an easy one.

144
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,690
A leaky, 10-year-old beanbag chair...

145
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:10,195
covered in beer, bong water and fossilized
Cool Ranch Dorito fingerprints.

146
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,195
Italy.

00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,630
[Speaking Italian]

148
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,259
Guys, this chair has been here forever.

149
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,269
You gotta take it with you. Italy.

150
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:22,671
Ted, Italy doesn't need something
that is wrinkled, red and leaky...

151
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,233
and smells like booze and narcotics.

152
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,144
They've already got former
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.

153
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,842
[Laughs]
I don't know who that is.

154
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,351
All rulings are final.

155
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,616
Okay, why are things that we like
getting Triangled...

156
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,657
and crap you like sneaks through?

157
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,557
- Like what?
- That old 50-pound karaoke machine.

158
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,427
Come on! We sang in the New Year in '02
on this thing, remember?

159
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,227
We were Destiny's Child.

160
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,201
And since I was Beyoncé, I'm pretty sure
I get final say here, so...

161
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,469
Uh, we were not your backup singers,
bitch. We were a group.

162
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:01,741
I'm sorry. Are you guys married to Jay-Z,
or am I married to Jay-Z?

163
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,339
- Italy.

Wow. The way you used that kid having
an asthma attack as a human shield...

166
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,090
that took my breath away.

167

- Okay, next...

168
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,955
- I'll be point guy, and you lay down cover.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

169
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,997
Are you suggesting that
I will not be point guy?

[Chuckles]
Look, if Michael Jordan's healthy...

171
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:24,835

this chair in the last year.

that we'll be doing...

I mean, if it was still here

00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,675
And everything's gonna be okay.

342
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,108
Any last words?

343
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,879
Seeing you on the field of battle...

344
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:10,388
ruthless, manipulative, untrustworthy...

345
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,254
you've got all the qualities
I would have wanted in a son.

346
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,452
Now I say to you...

347
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,723
the last words my father said to me...

348
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,526
"Shoot me already."

349
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,165
Or we could keep playing if you want.

350
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,865
Nah, it's stupid.

351
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,468
Okay, Team Animal House.
I got him. Come on out.

352
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,274
You're point guy, R-dog.

00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,363
Oh, thank God.

356
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,146
This is a sign from the universe.

357
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,710
- It's not a sign from the universe.
- Yes, it is.

358
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:20,155
The locket is just gone, and you're
telling me that doesn't mean anything?

359
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,455
You know this is a bad omen, Ted.

360
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,519
- You're Universe Guy.
- And you're Skeptic Girl.

361
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,427
You're not supposed
to believe any of that.

362
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,331
Well, maybe I've grown
skeptical of being skeptical.

363
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:32,169
This is a sign.

364
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:35,604
Look, it's not a sign. You're doing
the right thing marrying Barney.

365
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,972
The universe isn't
sending you some message.

367
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,877
As we know from science...

368
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,180
rain is liquid water
in the form of droplets...

369
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:50,551
which have condensed from atmospheric
vapor and then precipitated.

370
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:55,184
- It's not a sign.
- Ted, this is a sign, and you know it!

371
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,388
I mean, the universe is
screaming at me right now!

372
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,796
How can you, of all people,
tell me to ignore that?

373
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,268
Because maybe it's dumb
to look for signs from the universe.

374
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,170
Maybe the universe
has better things to do.

375
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,299
Dear God, I hope it does.

376
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,640
Do you know how many signs I've gotten
that I should or shouldn't be with someone?

377
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,475
And where has it gotten me?

378
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,546
Maybe there aren't any signs. Maybe...

379
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:23,611
Maybe a locket's just a locket,
a... a chair is just a chair.

381
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,254
Maybe we don't have to give
meaning to every little thing.

382
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:30,420
Maybe we don't...

383
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,898
Maybe we don't need the universe
to tell us what we really want.

384
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:38,403
Maybe we already know that, deep down.
