1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:04,330
孩子们 维持良好关系 关键是要懂得交流
Kids, the key to a good relationship is communication.

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,700
- 你得懂得去说 - 去咪咪饭店吃饭怎么样?
- You need to talk. - How about Mimi's?

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,240
我不太想去那吃
Nah, I don't really feel like Mimi's.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,360
我饿了 我们找个地方 去吃点东西
Well, I'm hungry. Let's just pick a place and go.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,720
去森雅斯 怎么样?
Oh, you know where we should go? Cynthia's.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,450
你很喜欢那里 记得我们在那里度过的美好时光?
You love that place-- remember what a great time we had

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
上一次在那里的时候
the last time we were there?

8
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,020
我们? 是啊
- We did? - Yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,770
有个有趣的服务生不停的说 "你们两个应该结婚"
We had that crazy waiter who kept going, "You two should get married!

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,380
"你们两个应该结婚"
You two should get married!"

11
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,960
知道什么时候 应该闭嘴也很重要
It's also important to know when to stop talking.

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,090
想起了吗?然后我们就 走到了外面  外面正在下雨
Come on. Then we stepped outside. It was raining.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,970
很浪漫?
It was so romantic?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,850
你怎么能够把这些忘了?
How can you not remember this?

15
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,010
因为和你一起去的那个人不是我
Because it wasn't me.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,180
对...对...
Oh, right!

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,770
那个人是...
It was...

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,640
我妹妹
my sister.

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,560
你们知道  20多岁最难忘的就是
You see, by the time you've hit your late 20s,

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:43,990
和好多人曾经约会过
you've dated a few people,

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,570
但是当你正在和一个人谈恋爱时
but when you're in a relationship, it's common courtesy to pretend

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,540
最好装作你毫无恋爱经验
that you haven't.

23
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,200
在播范海辛
Oh, my God, Van Helsing is on.

24
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,900
记得我们一起看过这部片子?
Remember when we went to see it?

25
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,680
我们是坐在后排看的
We sat in the back row.

26
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,130
我从来没有看过范海辛
I've never seen Van Helsing.

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,370
想起来了 是和我妹妹一起去看的
That's right. I saw it with my sister.

28
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,640
我老板刚刚从毛伊岛回来
My boss just got back from Maui.

29
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,090
他说那里很浪漫
He said it was really romantic.

30
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,710
那里是不错
Oh, it's so romantic.

31
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,500
你什么时候去过毛伊岛?
When were you in Maui?

32
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,850
- 我是和...我妹妹一起的 - 和我妹妹
- I... went... with my sister. - With my sister.

33
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,590
你为什么总是说和你妹妹一起?
Why do you always say that?

34
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,510
我们都是成年人了 和别人约会过是很正常的事情
Look, we're not 16. We've both dated other people.

35
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,660
你为什么总要装作没有过?
It's silly to try to act like we didn't.

36
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,790
你说得对
You're right.

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
我不应该撒谎
We should just be honest.

38
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,330
完全不应该!
Totally.

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,160
看见坐在那里的女孩了?
See that girl over there?

40
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,710
三年前 我曾经追过她
Three years ago, I totally made out with her.

41
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,680
我不想听这个
I don't want to hear that.

42
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,220
- 什么?你说过... - 你这个人毫不知趣
- What? You said... - God, that is so insensitive.

43
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,090
- 你说过要诚实 - 你这个混蛋
- Remember honesty...? - You're a jerk!

44
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,350
你...
Well, you're...

45
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,160
真让人捉摸不透
confusing.

50
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,520
如果你不得不和某人上床
Okay, so you have to have sex with one.

51
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,330
你是选择人脸鱼身的古典美人鱼
Either classic mermaid; bottom half fish, top half human,

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,400
还是鱼脸人身的美人鱼?
or inverted mermaid, top half fish, bottom half human.

53
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,480
快说
Go!

54
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,510
我不知道 她胖吗?
I don't know. Is she fat?

55
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:10,290
美人鱼毕竟是鱼  当然丰满了
Yeah, but it's a fish, so it's the good kind of fat.

56
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,550
最新消息
Hot off the presses!

57
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,110
我不要广告宣传单
I-I don't take flyers.

58
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:16,050
你只要一会就走到那里了
You took one two seconds before you walked in here.

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,890
那不一样 我去看脱衣服走得通常很快
That's different. It was for a strip club.

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,860
如同装了一对翅膀
Two bucks off wings.

61
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,540
你宣传单上的演出有那么吸引我?
How much is your flyer going to save me on wings?

62
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,880
这是关于我演出的宣传单
Fine. It's a flyer from my play.

63
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,650
莉莉 我很想去 但是我们已经不是学生时代了
Oh, Lily, I'd love to, but we're not in college

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,210
我不会和你上床的
and I'm not trying to sleep with you.

65
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,910
- 所以无论如何 这条美人鱼... - 莉莉的朋友邀请她参加演出
- So anyway, this mermaid... - Hey, Lily's friend asked her

66
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,440
演出会很精彩
to be in this play, and it's gonna be really good.

67
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,990
莉莉 我很仰慕你 但是我们都过了这个年龄了
Lily, I love you, but we're too old for this.

68
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,850
让别人去看你的演出
Asking someone to come see your play

69
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,460
就如同让别人开车送你去机场
is like asking someone for a ride to the airport

70
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:43,250
或是让他抱你到沙发上 或让他帮你搬家
or to crash on your couch or to help you move.

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,900
叫个司机 订个房间 雇些搬运工 跟着我说
Call a cab, book a room,

72
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,990
再雇些搬运工 跟在我后面不停的说
hire some movers and repeat after me:

73
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,360
"朋友不会强迫他朋友去看糟糕表演的"
Friends don't let friends come see their crappy play.

74
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,080
首先 我会考虑 选择鱼面人身美人鱼
Okay, first of all, I've thought about it and top half fish.

75
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,070
第二  需要你们 帮我和罗宾决定一件事情
Second of all, we need you guys to decide something for us.

76
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,470
是的  你们应该分手
Yes, you should break up.

77
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,270
今晚发生了件事情
So, earlier tonight...

78
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,390
我看我们应该去酒吧了
Mm, we should get down to the bar.

79
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,190
我知道
I know we should,

80
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,800
但你穿着我的红色运动服好性感
but you just look so sexy in my red sweatshirt.

81
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,120
干吗说这个?
Oh, God, why is this part of the story?

82
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,390
故事还没有完
We're getting to it.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,850
该死的 我的脸好干 这里有润肤露?
Damn, my face is so dry. Is there any moisturizer around here?

84
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,430
卫生间里应该有
Yeah, there's some in the bathroom.

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,060
去拿润肤露
Got to moisturize!

86
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,330
让那俊俏的小脸更加滋润
Got to keep that pretty face moist.

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,330
不...不...不!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

88
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,010
- 她怎么了? - 她讨厌那个词
- What's wrong with her? - She hates that word.

89
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,310
- 哪个词?'湿润'? - 快给我闭嘴!
- What word, "moist"? - No! Seriously, stop!

90
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,050
然后泰德去卫生间里给我拿...
So, anyway, Ted goes into the bathroom to get the moist...

91
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,640
润肤露...
face lotion...

92
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,460
这东西不错
Wow, this is great stuff.

93
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,870
我知道你皮肤好的秘诀了
Now I know the secret to your great complexion.

94
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,460
你在说什么?这润肤露是你的
What are you talking about? It's yours.

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,670
不  不是我的
No, it's not.

96
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,120
那可能是莉莉的
Oh, well... then I guess it's Lily's.

97
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,460
也不是我的
No, it's not.

98
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,330
润肤露究竟是谁的?
Whose moisturizer is this, Ted?

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,790
是我妹妹的...
Um, my sister's.

100
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,190
换句话说 它是 和你约会的某个女生的
So, in other words, some girl you went out with.

101
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,130
啊...我爱你 亲爱的
Um... I love you.

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,580
真恶心! 你竟然让我用你前任女友的润肤露
Disgusting. You let me put on the same moisturizer as one of your exes?

103
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,540
可能是卡尔的 她的皮肤很糟糕
It was probably Carla's. Her face was a train wreck.

104
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,250
泰德又不是和她的脸约会
I'm don't think Ted was dating her for her face.

105
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,460
多谢 马修
Thank you, Marshall.

106
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,970
十分感谢
Thank you so much.

107
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,720
为什么它还在你的屋子里?
Why is that still in your apartment?

108
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,530
我不知道啊 可能是我从来没有把它扔掉
I don't know. I just never threw it out.

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,150
为什么不扔掉? 你对她还念念不忘?
Well, why not? Do you still have feelings for this girl?

110
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,540
是的  我疯狂的爱着她
Yeah. I'm madly in love with her,

111
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,100
而且我唯一可以做的
and the only way I can deal with it

112
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,350
就是寄情于一只3美元的润肤露
is by holding onto a three-dollar tube of lotion.

113
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,560
3美元!怎么不说是14美元!
Not three dollars! Try 14.

114
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,080
你干吗这么生气?
Why is this such a big deal?

115
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,130
因为我不想用妓女的润肤露!
Because I don't want to use some whore's moisturizer!

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,120
她不是妓女
Whoa, she wasn't a whore.

117
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,280
如果一个女人用过的润肤露 满城都能找到
Well, she's leaving expensive lotions all over town.

118
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,920
对于我来说  她就是妓女
It sounds like a whore to me.

119
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,680
你还留着前任女友的 其他什么东西?
What else do you have from old girlfriends just lying around?

120
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,280
没有了  就这个
Nothing. That's it.

121
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,780
除了那个电话亭
Well, except for the phone booth.

122
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,350
桌子旁边的灯
And the lamp by the desk...

123
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,470
还有...
and the...

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,540
不...
No.

125
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,270
不...不...不! 泰德
No! No! Oh, Ted!

126
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,550
还是个老问题
Ah, the age-old question:

127
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,140
一旦你和某人分手 你该如何处理那些东西
after you break up with someone, what do you do with the stuff?

128
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,500
问题?那不应该是问题
Question? Ain't no question, girl.

129
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,220
很显然 他应该把那些都扔了
Obviously, he's got to get rid of it.

130
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,370
那显然很疯狂 而且我显然不会那么做
Which is obviously crazy and obviously, I'm not gonna do it.

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,310
所以我们同意 让你们帮我们拿主意
So we agreed that we would let you guys decide.

132
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,390
就像我们处理马修的裤子那样
Yeah, like we did with Marshall's pants.

133
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,820
2005年轰动的案例 莉莉对决乔伊・布塔弗科裤子
Ah, the 2005 landmark case of Lily v. The Joey Buttafuoco Pants.

134
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,570
不错  是吧?
Nice, right?

135
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,060
我觉得不怎么好
I'm gonna have to say no.

136
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,050
我可不会让一个16岁的女孩爱上你
I don't want some 16-year-old girl falling in love with you

137
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,850
让莉莉伤心
and then shooting Lily in the face.

138
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
太好了
Yes!

139
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,480
我认为那女生会和他在一起
I vote they can stay.

140
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,870
因为穿着迷彩服去结账是很少见的
"Check out the jackass in the parachute pants" is a good icebreaker.

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,620
泰德
T ed.

142
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,440
泰德 泰德 你说说看
Ted? Ted?

143
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,610
不好意思 我也觉得不行
Sorry, buddy, it's a "no" for me, too.

144
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,220
顺便说一下 贝尔声称
Oh, and by the way, Bel Biv Devoe called.

145
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,400
他们也不会如此打扮了
Even they don't want those pants back.

146
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:01,740
它们穿起来很舒服
They were insanely comfortable!

147
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,150
就像可以穿出门的睡衣
They were like pajamas you could wear outside.

148
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,870
这些都过去了
Marshall, it's over.

149
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,700
我们甚至还帮你瞧了瞧 配上军靴还是不好看
We even gave you an appeal and they didn't look any better with combat boots.

150
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,590
外面听听他们的争论 泰德 你先说
All right, well, let's hear the arguments. Ted, you go first.

151
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,510
我还留着前任女友的东西 不值得大惊小怪
Okay. The fact that I still have things from ex-girlfriends is no big deal.

152
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,580
我的意思是说 当我看到钢琴上的电话亭时
I mean, when I see the phone booth on the piano,

153
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,280
我并没有想到吉莉
I don't think of Jeannie Radford,

154
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,850
想到的是 在欧洲旅游时候的快乐时光
I think of the good times I had backpacking through Europe.

155
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,010
当我看到台灯时 我没有想到爱丽舍
And when I see the lamp, I don't think of Allison Moses.

156
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,250
我想到大学毕业后 我穷困潦倒的时候
I remember when I was broke, just out of college,

157
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,030
我需要一盏台灯
and I really needed a lamp.

158
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,260
当我看到抱枕时 我没有想到劳恩
And when I see that throw pillow, I don't think of Lauren Stein.

159
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,270
我想到的是上面那桔红色污点 以及是如何弄上去的
I think of that weird orange-brown stain and how it got there.

160
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,130
都是些意外之财
Creamsicle and turkey gravy,

161
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,630
不同时候的意外之财
not at the same time.

162
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,750
不错  那些是很可爱
Well, that's adorable,

163
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,530
但是从现在起 当我走进公寓 我看到的是...
but from now on, when I walk into the apartment, here is what I will see.

164
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:52,150
我是泰德的大学女友 他曾经给我做了12盘混音磁带
I'm Ted's college girlfriend. He made me 12 mix tapes.

165
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,080
他给你做过多少?
How many has he made you?

166
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,070
他叫你'甜心派'?
He calls you "sweetie pie"?

167
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,210
他就是这么叫我的
He called me "sweetie pie."

168
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,110
我不聪明 但是我的胸部比你大
I'm stupid, but my rack is bigger than yours.

169
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,850
真的? 你不能这么下结论
Really? You can't look at a pillow

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,920
仅仅看到一个抱枕而没有看到真人 那只是抱枕!
without seeing my ex-girlfriend-- a pillow!

171
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,310
事实是那个抱枕很恶心!
Yes, Ted, the fact that you still have that pillow is creepy and gross.

172
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,100
- 你才恶心! - 你妈才恶心!
- You're creepy and gross. - Your mom's creepy and gross.

173
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,920
肃静! 肃静!
Order! Order!

174
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,950
我站在罗宾这边
I got to side with Robin.

175
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,240
她现在是你的女友 她觉得不爽的东西 你就应该扔了
She's your girlfriend, and if the stuff upsets her, you got to get rid of it.

176
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,070
我支持泰德
I've got to side with Ted.

177
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,170
留着前任女友的东西
Just 'cause you still have something an ex-girlfriend gave you

178
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,900
并不意味着你还想着她
doesn't mean you're holding onto her.

179
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,330
好了 巴尼
All right, Barney.

180
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,370
该你说了
It all comes down to you.

181
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,670
- 我支持罗宾 - 什么?
- I side with Robin. - What?

182
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,440
你那地方太乱了
Ted, your place is too cluttered.

183
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,720
和住在本尼根餐厅差不了多少
It's like you're living in a Bennigan's.

184
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,770
或者在丹比店里
Or a Danby's.

185
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,580
什么?美国没有丹比吗?
What, they don't have Danby's in the US?

186
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,460
真的?
Really?

187
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,680
那你们吃过掌印冰淇淋三明治吗?
Well, then were do you get Grizzly Paw ice cream sandwiches?

188
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,310
别说了 亲爱的
Just stop, sweetie.

189
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,180
我别无他法
So I had no choice.

190
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,890
只得把我前任女友的 所有东西打包
I packed up everything I had gotten from ex-girlfriends.

191
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,310
万分痛苦
It was painful,

192
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,630
但那晚更痛苦
but not as painful as what I had to endure later that night.

193
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,110
纽约以戏剧而出名
New York is famous for its theater,

194
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,770
但是戏剧水平也是分档次的
but there's many different levels.

195
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,220
那里有百老汇级别的
There's Broadway,

196
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,890
稍次于百老汇的
off-Broadway,

197
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,730
比百老汇差多了的
off-off-Broadway,

198
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,990
无家可归的人在公园里尖叫
homeless people screaming in the park,

199
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,150
紧接着就轮到莉莉的表演
and then below that, the play Aunt Lily was in.

200
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,670
八楼
Eight flights, of stairs.

201
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,710
什么剧院会建在八楼?
Who puts a theater up eight flights of stairs?

202
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,240
这是个什么建筑?
What kind of building is this?

203
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,460
闻这味道 估计以前是个工厂
From the smell of it, I'm guessing a urine factory.

204
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,480
我们该坐哪?
Where do you guys want to sit?

205
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,870
我知道我不想坐哪
I know where I don't want to sit.

206
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,550
这里有四个连一起的位置
Guys, four together!

207
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
我带了个口袋  以防看得会吐了
I brought a bag in case anyone needs to puke.

208
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,140
快点 我看没那么糟吧
Come on. It's not gonna be that bad.

209
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,800
没那么糟? 好吧 就当我没说
No? Okay.

210
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,260
我..是...愤怒
I... am... Rage!

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,390
我...是...贪婪
I... am Greed.

212
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,160
我是愤怒... 不 是嫉妒
I am Rage... Envy!

213
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,350
我想走了
I am outta here.

214
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,560
不行 你得留下来
No, you're not. You have to stay.

215
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,320
这是物欲的嘴脸
This is the face of Consumerism!

216
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,880
泰德也成戏中的角色了
Oh, my God. Ted's part of the play.

217
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,910
你们好 贪婪 愤怒...
Hello, Greed, Rage...

218
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,000
嫉妒...
Envy...

219
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,070
还有物欲
and Consumerism.

220
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,220
我..是你们的父亲...
I... am your father...

221
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,740
美国!
America!

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,220
亲爱的 你演得太棒了
Oh, baby, that was wonderful!

223
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,590
我完全没有料到贪婪是凶手
Totally, I had no idea Greed was the killer.

224
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,380
当我参加表演
And when it became a play within a play,

225
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,780
我会像这样 '现在我们都醉了'
I was, like, "Now we are really cookin'!"

226
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,790
你们演得太差劲了!
Wow, Lily, that sucked!

227
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,640
巴尼!
Barney!

228
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,280
怎么了?是很糟糕啊
What? It was terrible.

229
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,630
我的意思是... 伙计们 你们都同意我说的 是吗?
I mean, come on. You guys agree, right?

230
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,300
不好意思 我一向很坦白 '因为我们是朋友'
Hey, sorry, I'm just being honest 'cause, you know, we're friends.

231
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,050
朋友应该让别人开心
No, friends make each other feel good.

232
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,330
他们站在背后 支持着朋友
They build each other up and support them.

233
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,670
这才是朋友该做的!
That's what being a good friend is about.

234
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,980
如果你是蓝精灵 我会那么做
Yeah, if you're a Smurf.

235
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,770
如果你表演 我会一直坐在那里看
You know if you did a play, I would sit through the whole thing

236
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,130
而且看完也不会抱怨什么
and I would compliment you on it afterwards.

237
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,490
真的吗? 你真的会那样?
Oh, really? You would?

238
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,570
当然
Yes.

239
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,030
真是让人感动
Bad move, Aldrin, bad move.

240
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,970
五分钟后 将在这里进行导演观众见面会
We'll be starting our Q&A with the director--

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,300
你们真诚的...
yours truly--

242
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,812
in five minutes right here.

243
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,850
你能想像刚才 巴尼说的那些话
Can you believe Barney said that about Lily's play?

244
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,830
那家伙说话不经大脑思考
I know. He can be really insensitive.

245
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,790
他说的那话很糟糕
It was pretty bad, though.

246
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,530
是的 糟糕透了
Oh, my God, it was so bad.

247
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,330
你家遭打劫了?
Oh, my God, you've been robbed!

248
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,430
不是!
Nope.

249
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,970
你把前任女友送的东西都丢了?
All that stuff was from old girlfriends?

250
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,340
你都不帮自己买东西的?
Don't you buy anything for yourself?

251
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,780
该怎么说呢...
What can I say?

252
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,450
那些东西都是可有可无的
Papa gets swag.

253
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,640
这个故事本该结束了 但是第二天...
And that should've been the end of it. But the next day...

254
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,050
刚扔掉我的那些东西时 我很伤心...
You know, at first I was really bummed about getting rid of all my stuff.

255
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,640
但是看到你很开心 我就觉得很值
But seeing how happy it makes you-- totally worth it.

256
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,310
我明白你的感受
Mm, that's kind of how I feel when I begrudgingly have sex with you

257
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,490
就像我很累却要勉强做爱时的那样
when I'm really tired.

258
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,300
完全正确 有时候 为了大家应该要妥协
Exactly. Sometimes you gotta take one for the team.

259
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,170
坐下 坐下
Well, sit. Sit, yeah.

260
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,540
你有你前任男友留下的东西?
So you never keep anything your ex-boyfriends gave you?

261
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,640
没有
N ope.

262
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,550
除了我的小狗
Well, except for my dogs.

263
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,590
我丢弃了所有以前女友送我的东西
So I had to get rid of everything from my past relationships

264
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:32,140
是因为你没有那些东西
because you don't keep things from your past relationships

265
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,440
这5只小狗是从哪里来的?
except, uh, where are your five dogs from? Oh, that's right:

266
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,070
是你前男友们送的
your past relationships.

267
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,400
泰德 你究竟想说什么?
What's your point, Ted?

268
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,000
你说你到我公寓来
Well, you know how you said you come over to my apartment,

269
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,250
不管看到什么都如同 看到我前任女友...
and all you can see are my ex-girlfriends?

270
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,810
你的意思就是说 看见我的小狗 就如同看到了我前任男友?
What, so when you look at my dogs, all you see is my ex-boyfriends?

271
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,560
现在的确如此
I do now.

272
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,310
真是荒谬
That's ridiculous.

273
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,910
我记得你说过 你丢了前任男友送你的所有东西!
I thought you said you got rid of everything your ex-boyfriends gave you.

274
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,530
是的 除了小狗
Well, yeah, but not my dogs.

275
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,370
你说的是所有东西
You said everything.

276
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,980
生物除外
But not living things.

277
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,940
但是我把别人送的仙人掌也扔掉了
Well, tell that to the rare Bolivian cactus I threw away.

278
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,160
那是植物 没有心脏的不包括在内
Things with a heartbeat can stay.

279
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,750
你很开心 是吧?
Enjoying this?

280
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,820
皮卡 去捡你的球
Pickles, go get your ball.

281
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,460
快去
Go get your ball.

282
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,860
认了吧 你有点自私
Just admit it. It was a little hypocritical of you

283
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,440
让我扔掉那些东西
to make me get rid of all my stuff.

284
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,740
好吧 你想让我怎么做? 扔掉我的小狗?
Well, what do you want me to do, Ted? Get rid of my dogs?

285
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,790
我们的位子是不可取代的
Guess what position we did it in.

286
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,620
是的 我想让你扔了这些狗
Yes. Yes, I want you to get rid of your dogs.

287
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,410
不
Um, no.

288
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,510
当真? 如果让大伙来决定的话
Really? Well, I say we take it to the group,

289
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,250
我觉得他们 不会站在你这边的
but I don't like your chances.

290
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,190
她不能扔了她的狗
She's not getting rid of the dogs.

291
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,010
你怎么了?
What's the matter with you?

292
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,250
- 换成我也不会扔 - 的确是这样
- Even I wouldn't do that. - Yes!

293
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,690
你可以要求别人扔了蜥蜴 如果它们爬进你头发里
You can ask somebody to get rid of their iguana after it poops in your hair,

294
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,510
但不能要求扔了他们的狗
but not their dog.

295
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,320
我开始想念占比第恩了
I miss Jebediah.

296
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,340
我差点忘了
Oh, I almost forgot.

297
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,290
我演出的广告宣传单
Flyers for my new play.

298
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,790
真有趣
Very funny.

299
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,930
我不是开玩笑
Oh, it's not a joke.

300
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,290
这是我个人表演的首场演出
It's my one-man show premiering tomorrow night.

301
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,070
虽然演出很烂而且时间会很长
And even though it's terrible and excruciatingly long,

302
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:17,760
我们是好朋友 我希望你们都去
I expect you all to be there since we're such good friends.

303
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,940
我们会去的
Oh, we'll be there.

304
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,080
除非 你们承认不是...
Unless, of course, you just want to admit that you were wrong...

305
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,620
不会的 太好了
- Never. - Good.

306
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,160
就这样 我去彩排了
Okay, I gotta go rehearse.

307
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,950
忘了提醒你们要带雨衣
Oh, I almost forgot. Bring a poncho;

308
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,530
坐在前三排会被淋湿的
the first three rows get wet.

309
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,890
我很抱歉 没有告诉你狗是哪里来的
I'm sorry I didn't tell you where the dogs came from.

310
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,620
我很抱歉让你把它们扔了
I'm sorry I asked you to get rid of them.

311
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,160
有点不可思议
That was ridiculous.

312
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,120
这么说我们扯平了
So we're-we're okay?

313
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,390
是的 扯平了
Yeah, we're great.

314
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,570
尽管我那么认为
And I thought we were,

315
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,740
但是如同莉莉 戏里第七幕演的那样
but just as it did in the seventh act of Aunt Lily's play,

316
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,120
我还是满怀妒忌
Jealousy reared its ugly head.

317
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,380
真舒服
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

318
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,850
让开 我要撒尿
Dude, I gotta pee.

319
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,600
我走了
I gotta go.

320
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:42,900
他真的不喜欢那些狗 是吗?
Oh, he's really having trouble dealing with this, huh?

321
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,410
他真的很不喜欢
Yeah, he really is.

322
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,620
或许我应该把它们扔了
It's got me thinking, maybe I should get rid of my dogs.

323
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,090
或许把它们送到农场去
Might be time to send them to the farm.

324
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,800
- 你打算宰了它们? - 不是 不是
- You're gonna kill your dogs?! - No! No, no, no,

325
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,350
我阿姨有个农场
there really is a farm.

326
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,160
在郊区
My aunt has a farm upstate.

327
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,630
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

328
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,040
你知道的 如果我是那5只狗
Aw, you know, if I were five dogs,

329
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,690
我宁可住在农场 而不是市区的公寓里
I'd rather live on a farm than in an apartment in Brooklyn.

330
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,530
我可以周末去看它们
Yeah. I could visit them on weekends.

331
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,370
我阿姨孤孤单单住在农场 而且她很喜欢狗
My aunt is awfully lonely up there. It's just her and her lover, Betty.

332
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,350
那太好了 他们喜欢小狗
Oh, that's perfect. They love dogs.

333
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,500
他们? 你'他们'是什么意思?
"They"? What do you mean by "they"?

334
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,100
嗯...嗯... 郊区的人...
Uh... uh.... uh... People upstate.

335
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,720
演出开始了
Oh, look, it's starting. Shh!

336
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,040
你肯定你还好?
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

337
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,330
我的意思是 你知道演出会...
I mean, you know that this is gonna be...

338
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,150
但是我会坚持看下去的
I know, but I'm gonna sit through the whole thing,

339
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,620
而且我打算表演 结束后说些好听的
and I'm gonna say something nice about it afterwards.

340
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,570
你知道为什么?
You know why?

341
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,380
因为这是朋友应该做的
Because that's what friends do.

342
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,370
潮湿
Moist.

343
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,300
潮湿
M oist.

344
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,100
潮湿
Moist.

345
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,400
潮湿
Moist.

346
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,520
演出前40分钟都是在说这词
That was the first 40 minutes of Barney's show.

347
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,590
潮湿
Moist.

348
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,930
然后我们忍受了20分钟的这个
And then we endured about 20 minutes of this.

349
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,490
我得去加水了
I have to go refill.

350
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,370
一会就回来
I'll be back in a moment.

351
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,660
表演还没有结束
Play's not over.

352
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,690
从来没有选过我参与演出
I never get picked for audience participation.

353
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,060
它变得更加诡异
And then it just got weird.

354
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,860
感受
Feelings.

355
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,100
内心的感受
Inside.

356
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,290
哦 不
Oh, no!

357
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,830
当那个不奏效时
And when that didn't work...

358
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,670
停下!
Okay! Stop!

359
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,470
你赢了 行吧
You win. Fine.

360
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,110
很抱歉让你去看我的表演
Barney, I'm sorry I made you come to my show.

361
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,240
谢谢 莉莉
Thank you, Lily.

362
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,420
关于我的演出 你还想说点什么?
Is there anything you'd like to say about my show?

363
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,370
无话可说
No.

364
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,760
对于你的表演 我没有什么好话可说的
No, I have nothing nice to say about your show.

365
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,230
你是对的 巴尼
You were right, Barney.

366
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,600
我们去酒吧
Let's go to the bar.

367
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,020
太棒了 我赢了
Yes! I win!

368
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,750
我喜欢胜利
I love winning!

369
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,190
哦 莉莉 哦 莉莉 莉莉
Oh, Lily. Oh, Lily, Lily, Lily.

370
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,300
伙计们 我刚才只是热身
I was just getting warmed up, man!

371
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,560
我猜那会很糟的 我们走
Well, I imagine it was pretty awful, so let's go.

372
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,920
很糟?很糟? 糟糕的事情才刚刚开始
Pretty awful? Pretty awful?! It was a masterpiece of awful.

373
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,440
只有天才才能演得这么糟! 我希望你们继续看下去
It's genius how bad it is. I kind of wish you guys could see it.

374
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,140
无论如何你说的都是对的
Yeah, well, anyway.

375
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,570
第二部分我弄伤了我的腿
Act two is where I really hit my stride.

376
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,350
扰流器改变了方向: 机器人坠入爱河
Spoiler alert: the robot falls in love.

377
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,360
你看这样如何? 我呆在这里
How about this, Barney? How about we stay

378
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,420
看完你剩下的演出?
and-and watch the rest of your show?

379
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,210
你会很痛苦的
It's your funeral.

380
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,530
五 六 一 二
Five, six, one, two.

381
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,750
所以我们又被折磨了一个半小时
So we stayed and let Barney torture us for another hour and a half,

382
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,740
之所以会这样 很显然因为我们是朋友
'cause that's what friends do, apparently.

383
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:30,830
Hey.

384
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,950
你去哪儿了? 我刚才打电话给你了
Where've you been? I called you earlier.

385
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:35,590
我把狗送到我阿姨那里去了
I gave my dogs away to my aunt.

386
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,760
什么?
You what?

387
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,620
前段时间是磨合期 但是...
Yeah. Just for a few months as a test run, but...

388
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,990
我认为还是把它们送走为好
I think it's for the best.

389
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,760
啊!
Wow.

390
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,690
真是想不到 亲爱的
Oh, man.

391
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,360
我们进屋吧?
Can we go inside?

392
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,770
啊 不! 我们还是去酒吧好了
Uh, no. Uh, let's go to the bar.

393
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,430
怎么了? 里面发生什么了?
Why? What's going on inside?

394
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,760
- 地板没了 - 什么?
- Um, the floors are gone. - What?

395
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,310
我把它们送去修了
Yeah. I-I sent them out to get, um, fixed.

396
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,330
我撒了谎 我放弃
This is a terrible lie. I'm just going to bail.

397
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,030
我不知道你把狗送走了!
I didn't know you were getting rid of the dogs!

398
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,980
你说过你 把那些东西都扔了的!
You said you threw all that stuff away!

399
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,070
这是我和罗宾 经历的最糟糕的事情
Kids, this was the worst fight Robin and I ever had.

400
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,520
也是能够持续数小时的战争之一
It was one of those fights that last for hours

401
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,700
我们头脑发晕 到后来甚至不知道两个人在吵什么
and you start to get woozy and lose track of what you're fighting about.

402
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,520
我们吵了很久 窗外的季节都变了
We fought for so long, seasons changed outside the window.

403
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,390
日历不停翻页 真是疯狂
Pages of the calendar blew off. It was crazy.

404
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,010
但是最后 我不得不告诉你我的生活如何
But, ultimately, and I couldn't tell you how for the life of me,

405
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,630
以及为什么会变成这样
but somehow we got to here.

406
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,200
我们真要这么做吗?
We're really doing this?

407
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,780
是的
Yeah.

408
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,810
- 我们搬到一块住了 - 我们搬到一块住了
- We're moving in together! - We're moving in together!

409
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,460
机器人觅得了爱情
The robot found love

410
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,350
系统识别错误
Confusing my circuitry

411
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,510
我的系统出现故障
My software's been hacked

412
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,170
吐司烘箱
Toaster oven

413
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,390
是为我准备的
You're the one for me

414
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:17,650
二 三 四
Two, three, four.

415
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,540
解决问题
That's two.
