1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,073
- Hey.
- Hey, guys, how's it going?

2
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,999
I'm gonna finish this.

3
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,130
We had dinner
with Stella's sister and her fiancÃ©?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,518
- They're getting married before us.
- How you've dreamt

5
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,879
about your perfect wedding day
when you were a little girl?

6
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,630
- Yeah.
- Totally.

7
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,591
My sister is stealing
my dream wedding.

8
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:23,472
Down to every last detail
on Shelter Island, at sunset...

9
00:00:23,853 --> 00:00:27,435
... just down the beach
from our family's old summer house.

10
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,772
It's my dream wedding.

11
00:00:30,388 --> 00:00:31,922
I'm gonna finish this.

12
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:37,825
- The lamb here is supposed to be great.
- I'm a vegan.

13
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:40,203
I wish I could tune out
that moral voice

14
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,623
inside me
that says eating animals is murder,

15
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:46,335
but I guess I'm just not
as strong as you are.

16
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,213
That's 'cause you need protein.

17
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,159
I'll have the lamb.

18
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:54,887
Okay, new goal:

19
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,601
I want our wedding
to kick her wedding's ass.

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:00,055
I want our wedding
to take her wedding's head

21
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:02,733
and shove it in the toilet
and flush it, like,20 times.

22
00:01:03,595 --> 00:01:06,237
Ted, in high school,
you were her wedding, weren't you?

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,100
You know,she's always trying
to one-up me. I mean, I love her, but,

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,998
there's a part of me that kinda wishes
this whole thing would just fall apart.

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,251
I hate him. I hate him!

26
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,671
I hate him.
God, this steak is so good!

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,506
Four days to go and he just runs off

28
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,536
with the vitamin consultant
from Whole Foods?

29
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,718
I gave up makeup for him.
I gave up showering for him.

30
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:27,515
I gave up shaving my armpits for him.

31
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:30,165
Hard to imagine
where it all went wrong.

32
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,181
Now it's so close to the wedding...
There's like bacon or something

33
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,509
in this dipping sauce. I love it.
I can't get any refunds.

34
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,529
I'm gonna be out
thousands of dollars.

35
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:39,281
<i>Kids, when you're in a relationship,</i>

36
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,993
<i>you develop a kind
of telepathy with your partner.</i>

37
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,719
<i>What do you think?</i>

38
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,207
<i>We could help her out.</i>

39
00:01:45,663 --> 00:01:46,715
<i>No, Stella,</i>

40
00:01:47,265 --> 00:01:48,897
<i>we should help her out.</i>

41
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,521
<i>Let's pay for dinner.</i>

42
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,643
Nora. Don't worry.

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,018
We got this.

44
00:01:57,312 --> 00:01:59,282
That's right.
We'll take over your wedding,

45
00:01:59,403 --> 00:02:01,233
pay you back
for everything you spent.

46
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:03,146
Ted and I will get married
this Sunday.

47
00:02:06,436 --> 00:02:08,681
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

48
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,719
We're getting married this Sunday?

49
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:27,805
Are we sure we're ready for this?

50
00:02:28,234 --> 00:02:30,900
Ted, I wasted years
trying to get Lucy's dad

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,146
to decide he was "ready" for this,

52
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:36,475
but he never got ready for this.
That's why we never got married.

53
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:38,910
Come on, let's just be spontaneous.

54
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,115
I used to dream that Tony
would be spontaneous like this.

55
00:02:42,793 --> 00:02:44,076
Okay, I'm in.

56
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,663
And I'm also... spontaneous.

57
00:02:51,347 --> 00:02:52,796
I wish I hadn't done that.

58
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,328
<i>Kids, morals usually
come at the end of stories,</i>

59
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:00,041
<i>but this one is so important,
I'm gonna tell you now:</i>

60
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:02,894
<i>Don't ever, ever
invite an ex to your wedding.</i>

61
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:06,481
<i>If someone had given me that advice,
well, it'd've changed everything.</i>

62
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,984
Come on, you've got to come,
it's my wedding.

63
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:10,980
I can't. I'm in Tokyo.

64
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:14,352
It's my first week on the job.
I can't just take off.

65
00:03:14,748 --> 00:03:17,837
Plus, I'm finally
doing serious news.

66
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,209
<i>Robin was doing serious news.</i>

67
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,047
<i>It was the number one
English news network in Japan.</i>

68
00:03:24,206 --> 00:03:26,498
<i>Of course, the news was
a little different over there.</i>

69
00:03:29,987 --> 00:03:32,759
The Federal Reserve Board voted
to leave interest...

70
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,186
rates unchanged.

71
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:37,966
It's my wedding.
You have to be there.

72
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,442
Okay. I'll be there.
I gotta go.

73
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,119
Good evening.

74
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,328
And I'm Robin Scherbatsky.

75
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,866
Peace talks were stalled once again
in the Middle East.

76
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:55,349
Despite a promising start
in the latest negotiations,

77
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:58,317
talks foundered on security issues.

78
00:03:59,003 --> 00:03:59,908
She's in.

79
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,038
All right,
your bachelor party, tonight.

80
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,646
I have got three of the most
physically and morally

81
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:08,165
flexible exotic dancers
you've ever seen...

82
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:10,273
- There's no time.
- I'll let you know how it goes.

83
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:12,873
We should really rent
the cars for tomorrow?

84
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:20,462
- What?
- No, "Don't get married, Ted"?

85
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:23,138
No, "You're making
a big mistake, Ted"?

86
00:04:23,438 --> 00:04:24,586
Barney Stinson...

87
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:28,591
are you no longer committed
to the war on marriage?

88
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,463
No, I just know
a hopeless cause when I see it.

89
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,230
It's the same reason
I don't recycle.

90
00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:36,412
Plus, Ted getting married

91
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,419
is in my best interest.

92
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:39,892
You see...

93
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,104
Lately I've been working on a problem
of the utmost importance.

94
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:46,679
I confess I was stumped.

95
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,998
Until one night I decided
to tackle it once and for all.

96
00:05:04,145 --> 00:05:05,901
Then, at last,

97
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,768
I cracked the code.

98
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:16,862
- So you're back on Robin.
- Hopefully.

99
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:21,160
I mean, this weekend is the best chance
ever to hook up with her again.

100
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,289
You'll never pull it off.
There's too many distractions.

101
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,686
The first drunk bridesmaid you see,

102
00:05:26,806 --> 00:05:29,922
you'll have your head under her dress
like an old-time photographer.

103
00:05:30,543 --> 00:05:32,175
Lily, don't cheapen this.

104
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:36,175
I don't want to sound all
mushy-gushy and romantic,

105
00:05:36,856 --> 00:05:39,559
but this weekend,
Robin is the only woman I'm banging.

106
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,898
<i>And so, the day before our wedding,</i>

107
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:45,985
<i>Stella and I made the trip up
to Shelter Island.</i>

108
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,531
<i>With everyone else not far behind.</i>

109
00:05:49,236 --> 00:05:50,950
- Zitch dog.
- Z... Zog...

110
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:56,556
This isn't exactly
where I pictured Ted getting married.

111
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:59,586
"The Namaste Yoga
and Meditation Collective."

112
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:02,257
I don't know about you, but Nama-stay
here any longer than I have to.

113
00:06:04,816 --> 00:06:07,013
Sweetie,
go check in with that dirty hippie

114
00:06:07,173 --> 00:06:09,212
over there
and we'll get some drinks.

115
00:06:12,909 --> 00:06:14,230
What scotches you got?

116
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:17,736
Here at the center,
we have a very strict no-alcohol policy.

117
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:22,061
Great, and all the meals
are included, right?

118
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,746
And they're all 100% vegan.

119
00:06:27,323 --> 00:06:28,818
I need alcohol.

120
00:06:29,064 --> 00:06:31,588
I'm not gonna get Robin
with this stuff.

121
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:33,080
Look at this.

122
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,752
Berry Blaster Brain Revitalizer.

123
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,676
My God, some of these drinks
could actually make a girl smarter.

124
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,725
What sort of hell
has Ted brought us to?

125
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:44,521
- There's no meat.
- There's no alcohol.

126
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:47,738
It gets worse:
I'm 90% sure that guy

127
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:50,809
you were talking with used to be
lead singer of the Spin Doctors.

128
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:53,867
Hey, guys,

129
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:56,621
Stella and I have a little problem.

130
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,624
The programs look great.

131
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:02,295
I mean, it's not our names on the front,
but otherwise, really nice.

132
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,678
I talked to Robin.

133
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,468
She's running a little bit late,
but she'll be here just under the wire.

134
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,515
- You invited Robin?
- Yeah, of course.

135
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:14,311
You never told me that.
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

136
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,366
Can I help?

137
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:18,024
You feel glad.

138
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,234
- You like Robin.
- Yeah, but

139
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:22,876
she's your ex-girlfriend.

140
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:24,420
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

141
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,564
It's weird.

142
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,663
You don't get what it's like for a bride
to see her groom's ex at their wedding.

143
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,381
Your new husband used to nail me,
like, three times a day.

144
00:07:38,587 --> 00:07:39,971
Having exes around,

145
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:42,391
I don't know, it brings up...

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,309
unresolved things.

147
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:48,064
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

148
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:51,528
Come on, we're just friends. Plus,
Robin and I already had our backslide

149
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,096
last Thanksgiving,
not even that long ago.

150
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:56,576
Did you place a large bet
against yourself in this argument?

151
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,852
She already got her ticket.

152
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:03,136
It's important to me.
I would never invite Lucy's dad.

153
00:08:03,256 --> 00:08:05,880
I wouldn't care if you did.
Tony's great. Let's invite him, too.

154
00:08:06,154 --> 00:08:09,209
Tony is the last person
I want at our wedding, okay?

155
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,891
And Robin is a close second.

156
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,848
Robin's probably
about to get on the plane.

157
00:08:17,968 --> 00:08:20,232
Plus, she left
a really important job for this.

158
00:08:20,392 --> 00:08:22,791
Spurred by environmental concerns

159
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,244
and high gasoline prices,

160
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:29,996
sales of hybrid vehicles have risen
11% over the previous year.

161
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:31,789
What should I do?

162
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:34,752
I don't know.
I kinda get the no exes thing.

163
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,921
Why ask a failed romance to come
and watch your successful one?

164
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,755
It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners
to a World Series game.

165
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,443
It's weird for everyone.

166
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:45,099
What? Robin has to come.

167
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,101
Right, she's, like, my best friend.

168
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,980
Female friend.
My best female friend.

169
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:52,484
I don't care, why fake it.

170
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:56,572
- Dude, Robin has to be here.
- She shouldn't come.

171
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:59,284
- What are you talk...
- Justice Aldrin, tie-breaking vote.

172
00:09:02,359 --> 00:09:06,001
Wouldn't feel right without Robin.
But you don't mess with the bride.

173
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,071
- I'm gonna tell her not to come.
- It's the right decision, Ted.

174
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:14,137
This is gonna be, like, the worst
phone conversation of all time.

175
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:17,015
Co-best man, I'm on it.

176
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:24,944
- Hello?
- Where are you?

177
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:26,922
Just heading to the airport.

178
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,825
We'll see you soon.
Have a great flight.

179
00:09:32,563 --> 00:09:34,859
Bad news.
I couldn't reach her.

180
00:09:34,979 --> 00:09:36,667
Robin's already on her way.

181
00:09:41,923 --> 00:09:44,803
Robin's on her way.
You know what, I'm glad.

182
00:09:45,257 --> 00:09:47,396
Exes should be allowed
to come to weddings.

183
00:09:47,516 --> 00:09:49,624
I'll just tell Stella
she's got to deal with it.

184
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:53,231
You need to be more delicate with Stella
about this whole Robin thing.

185
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:56,291
- What do you mean by delicate?
- Brides are under a lot of stress

186
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,461
before a wedding.

187
00:09:57,581 --> 00:10:00,198
I mean, of course,
I held it together pretty well.

188
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:03,703
You don't remember?

189
00:10:05,946 --> 00:10:09,684
The florist just told me
the roses are more light medium-pink

190
00:10:09,804 --> 00:10:11,247
than medium-pink.

191
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:14,551
Light medium-pink!
Everything's ruined.

192
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:19,270
Our wedding site uses
a gravity furnace

193
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,203
instead of forced-air heating.

194
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:25,306
That's the one thing I cared about.
Why are we even getting married?

195
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,457
After a while, it's all noise.

196
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:41,921
Poor Stella's had to jam months
of crazy into just three days.

197
00:10:42,081 --> 00:10:44,996
- So what do I do?
- You wait for the next crisis,

198
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,880
you solve it, you're a hero.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,223
Then you bring up the Robin thing,
but this time she'll say yes.

200
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,811
But what if there's no next crisis?

201
00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,649
She's a bride.
There will be a next crisis.

202
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,948
- There's an next crisis.
- Awesome! What is it?

203
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,703
My daughter, my own daughter
isn't coming to our wedding.

204
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:06,865
What?

205
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:09,887
Tony's supposed to drive her up
tomorrow, but now he's being all petty

206
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:12,047
about me getting married,
and he won't do it.

207
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:15,048
It's been five years.
Why can't we just move on already?

208
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,094
So first thing tomorrow,
I drive down, talk to him,

209
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:21,974
get him to let me drive Lucy up,
then, boom, crisis solved.

210
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:24,270
Stella's happy.
Robin comes to the wedding.

211
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,442
- You Barney?
- Yes.

212
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:30,778
I hear you're a real man whore,
so listen up.

213
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,747
Tomorrow night, I want to do things
so dirty and so depraved

214
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:37,334
that I forget that this was supposed
to be my wedding.

215
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,332
I'm kind of here with someone.

216
00:11:40,719 --> 00:11:41,719
Bring her.

217
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,423
You're never gonna make it.

218
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,706
<i>So, the morning of my wedding day
I made the trip back</i>

219
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,970
<i>to Tony's house</i>

220
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,197
<i>to get Lucy.</i>

221
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:58,148
Doing a little karate?

222
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:02,319
Sorry, sorry, man.

223
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,990
You set off my internal defense alarm.
You got to watch these things.

224
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,994
- Stay alert, stay alive.
- Right.

225
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,540
So what brings you here?
I thought you'd be off

226
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,793
in some honeymoon suite
with my woman right now.

227
00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:14,502
Not yet. Soon.

228
00:12:14,663 --> 00:12:16,808
That's right, tonight's the night.

229
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:18,131
Oh, man,

230
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:21,011
you are going to be sticking it
to the mother of my child.

231
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:23,544
Actually, I've already stuck it
to her plenty of times.

232
00:12:23,664 --> 00:12:25,569
Why do I always have
to correct people?

233
00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:26,970
You and Stella.

234
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,665
You lucky dog. I could just...

235
00:12:33,981 --> 00:12:35,657
I'm so happy for you, guys.

236
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,108
Listen, here's the thing...

237
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,300
- You can't take her.
- Tony, stop.

238
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:45,398
This is a big day for Lucy, too.

239
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,468
You're going to have
to put aside your own issues

240
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:50,384
and think about what's best for her,
here. Whether you like it or not,

241
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,769
she really should be at
her mother's wedding.

242
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,222
I'm taking Lucy with me.

243
00:12:58,853 --> 00:13:00,230
You're right, man.

244
00:13:00,637 --> 00:13:01,706
You're right.

245
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,580
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's just...

246
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:06,548
seeing you guys...

247
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,742
has made me realize
everything I had.

248
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:13,962
Let's stop hugging.

249
00:13:14,844 --> 00:13:15,844
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,193
Lucy means the world to me.

251
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:22,835
I feel like I'm losing her to this new
family, a family I'm not even a part of.

252
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:25,973
- Come on, sure you are.
- I wasn't even invited to the wedding.

253
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,434
You are now.

254
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,291
Road trip.

255
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,444
Right?

256
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,288
"Road Trip 2. Back in the Car".

257
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,751
Today's the day. You hydrating?

258
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:50,881
Dear female, thank you
for your interest in Barney Stinson...

259
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:53,468
Your back is going to look like
a Jackson Pollock.

260
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:56,993
I regret to inform you
that at this time...

261
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:00,143
I was a vegan for two years.
I need meat.

262
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:03,482
There are currently
no positions available.

263
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,998
I'm a yoga instructor.
Every position is available.

264
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,783
Your room, 20 minutes.
No foreplay.

265
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:16,576
- I'm not going to make it, am I?
- Not a chance.

266
00:14:21,234 --> 00:14:24,593
- Remember, let me talk to Stella first.
- Mommy!

267
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,552
Ted invited Daddy!

268
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:30,159
Hi, sweetie. I missed you.

269
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,353
Give me just a sec, okay?

270
00:14:36,452 --> 00:14:38,319
You invited Tony?
To our wedding?

271
00:14:39,648 --> 00:14:42,181
We talked about this.
No exes at our wedding.

272
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,707
- Why would you do this?
- Oh, boy.

273
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,763
What did Ted do this time?

274
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,933
What is Robin doing here?
I thought I made myself clear.

275
00:14:56,053 --> 00:14:57,511
No exes at our wedding.

276
00:14:58,505 --> 00:14:59,691
To be fair...

277
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,560
- your ex is here.
- You invited him!

278
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,938
- Come on, it's not weird.
- It is weird.

279
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,608
It's like things are not finished
between you two.

280
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:09,638
And Tony...

281
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:12,154
I can't deal with Tony now.
Can you please go out there

282
00:15:12,274 --> 00:15:14,890
and tell him to leave?
You can make me the bad guy.

283
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,913
I'll go talk to Robin,
so she knows it's nothing personal.

284
00:15:20,714 --> 00:15:23,628
<i>And, kids, if I had just let
Stella talk to Robin,</i>

285
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:25,674
<i>this whole story might have
ended differently.</i>

286
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:27,217
I understand.

287
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,441
I get it.

288
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:33,517
<i>For the first time,
Ted and Stella Mosby.</i>

289
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,009
<i>And that's how I met your mother.</i>

290
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,104
Is your dad finally done yakking?

291
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:42,442
Now, come on, who wants ice cream?

292
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,737
<i>But I didn't.</i>

293
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:47,753
Can you talk to Tony?
Robin flew all the way here from Tokyo.

294
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:49,175
I should talk to her.

295
00:15:50,564 --> 00:15:51,374
Sure.

296
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:00,500
- Sorry about running off like that.
- It's okay.

297
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,752
You would not believe the trip I had.
I was on a plane for almost a full day.

298
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:07,855
It's worth it to see you get married.
How could I not be here...?

299
00:16:08,015 --> 00:16:09,941
- You can't come to the wedding.
- Thank God!

300
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:10,984
What?

301
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,487
- It's weird.
- It's not weird.

302
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,909
It is weird. Do you know how it feels
to be somebody's ex at their wedding?

303
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:22,330
Suck it, bitch! I win!

304
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,171
We broke up over a year ago.

305
00:16:26,332 --> 00:16:28,607
Yeah, but that's not that long ago.

306
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:30,657
Watching your marry another woman

307
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:33,265
isn't exactly something
I was looking forward to.

308
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,178
I don't know, I just thought
if I ever changed my mind about

309
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:38,999
marriage and kids, it was...

310
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:41,525
it was nice to know
that you were there.

311
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:43,861
So, I was your safety school.
How flattering.

312
00:16:44,022 --> 00:16:46,959
- That's not it. It's just that...
- Why are you bringing any of this up?

313
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:49,536
- There's nothing between us anymore.
- Maybe there is.

314
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,618
I mean, of course there is.
That kind of stuff

315
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:56,128
doesn't disappear without a trace.

316
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,258
I'm not just another guest here.

317
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,521
Right. We used to date, but...

318
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:04,321
we both moved on.
And, look, we got what we wanted.

319
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,037
I'm getting married,
you got your dream job in Tokyo.

320
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,454
- And they all lived happily ever...
- I quit my job.

321
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:11,900
- You what?
- I'm moving back to New York.

322
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,496
I thought I wanted that job, but...

323
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,573
I want to come back to my real life.

324
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,952
And I think you should
go back to yours.

325
00:17:21,964 --> 00:17:23,772
What's that supposed to mean?

326
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,879
Don't get married.

327
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:31,234
Look, you're rushing into this.

328
00:17:31,355 --> 00:17:34,679
It's like you're trying to skip ahead
to the end of the book.

329
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,744
You're the most romantic guy I know.

330
00:17:36,865 --> 00:17:38,987
You stole a blue French horn for me.

331
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:40,562
You tried to make it rain.

332
00:17:40,723 --> 00:17:42,755
- I did make it rain.
- It was a coincidence.

333
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:47,401
But after all that, this is how your
great romantic quest comes to an end?

334
00:17:47,786 --> 00:17:50,194
You're just disappearing
into someone else's wedding,

335
00:17:50,313 --> 00:17:53,621
someone else's house, someone
else's life without a second thought.

336
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,642
That's not the amazing ending
that you deserve.

337
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,081
That's not Ted Mosby.

338
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,180
I love Stella.

339
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,641
She's the one.

340
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,458
If you really feel that way...

341
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:15,444
I guess it's a good thing you're not
coming to the wedding after all.

342
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:26,540
- Big fight?
- Yeah.

343
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:28,976
Here...

344
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:31,821
It's on the house.

345
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,880
Just keep 'em coming.

346
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:38,326
God, do not keep them coming.

347
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,236
I am having a horrible day.

348
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:51,990
I snuck some scotch in from the duty
free store. You want to join me?

349
00:18:52,842 --> 00:18:54,792
Let's go to your room.
Far away from this room.

350
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:58,154
- And we can knock it back.
- They didn't get me a room.

351
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:00,377
I was actually hoping
I could stay with you.

352
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,475
No problem.

353
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,626
I just have to straighten up
a little bit.

354
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,974
I've got some clothes
on the floor, and...

355
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,599
And a naked girl tied
to your headboard.

356
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:12,852
Towels all over the bathroom.
It's a mess.

357
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:16,231
So, anyway...
Give me ten minutes

358
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,817
- to get the place in order...
- See ya, Barney.

359
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,836
Okay, let's do this.

360
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,186
Who the hell is that?

361
00:19:36,316 --> 00:19:38,623
It's the girl from the front desk.

362
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:50,483
<i>Kids, sometimes you think
you're living out one story,</i>

363
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:54,208
<i>but the truth turns out
to be something else entirely.</i>

364
00:20:00,093 --> 00:20:01,523
<i>At the time I thought the story</i>

365
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:04,021
<i>was about whether Robin should be
at the wedding.</i>

366
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:13,976
<i>If only I'd understood
what the real story was.</i>

367
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:26,658
Having exes around...
I don't know, it brings up

368
00:20:27,152 --> 00:20:28,911
unresolved things.

369
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:36,005
How do you know that spark won't come
back with your ex sitting out there?

370
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,309
Like things are not finished
between you two.

371
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:47,543
I wasted years trying to get
Lucy's dad to decide

372
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,189
if he was ready for this.

373
00:20:49,476 --> 00:20:50,769
Seeing you guys...

374
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:54,189
It's made me realize
everything I had.

375
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:57,700
I used to dream that Tony would be
spontaneous like this.

376
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,899
<i>Seriously, kids,</i>

377
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,008
<i>never invite an ex</i>

378
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,630
<i>to your wedding.</i>
