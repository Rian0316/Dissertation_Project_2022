1
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,480
我最近读到在二战期间
I recently read that during World War Two,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,800
约瑟夫・斯大林曾有一项研究计划
Joseph Stalin had a research program

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,510
为了制造超级士兵
to create supersoldiers

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,890
要让女人怀上大猩猩的孩子
by having women impregnated by gorillas.

5
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,000
太变态的滥用科学了
What a sick use of science.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,150
只要孩子健康就没事啦
Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,410
不知道斯大林有没想过使用其他动物
I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,430
河马是杀伤性最高的动物
Hippos are the deadliest creature.

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,840
半人半河马应该会是狠角色吧
A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass.

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,700
但当它们饿饿的时候
Yes, but when they're hungry-hungry,

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,450
你用弹珠就能阻止它们了
you can stop them with marbles.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,330
{\an8}一种4名玩家控制河马头  抢吃弹珠的桌游

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,870
是的  制造跨族超级士兵的
Yeah, the correct animal

14
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,810
最佳选择是考拉
for interspecies supersolider is koala.

15
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,800
你可以做出一个超可爱  让人无法下手的军队
You would wind up with an army so cute it couldn't be attacked.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,500
但半人半猫头鹰可以飞...
But half-man, half-owl could fly...

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,140
正解就是让人想抱的大扁鼻子士兵  
The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses.

18
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,390
下个话题
Moving on.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,390
佩妮  新工作什么时候开始
So, Penny, when's the new job start?

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,570
下周一
Next Monday.

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,860
你找时间看了我给你的材料了吗
Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,160
还没  但我会看的
Uh, not yet, but I will.

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,230
-很好  -什么时候
- Great. - When?

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,910
我说了我会去看
I said I'll get to it.

25
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,300
我好像感觉到场面有些尴尬  是吧
I'm sensing awkwardness, am I right?

26
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,270
是的
Yes.

27
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,450
厉害
Swish.

28
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,390
我不想一直逼你
I don't want to be pushy,

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,200
但你之前从未接触过医药销售
but you've never done pharmaceutical sales before.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
你可以用这段时间领先其他人啊
It seems like you could use this time to get a head start.

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,300
前几周都是在培训
Well, the first few weeks will be all training.

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,970
他们会教我一切需要了解的信息
They'll tell me everything I need to know.

33
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,120
但你想象一下  你去的时候已经对材料很熟
But imagine how impressed they'd be if you showed up

34
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,030
他们肯定会对你刮目相看
already familiar with the material.

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,280
所以是怎样  你想让我当老师的小马屁精吗
Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacher's pet?

36
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,090
又没坏处
Couldn't hurt.

37
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,930
不知道啊
Mm, I don't know.

38
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,990
在座这里有谁
Who here has ever been hurt

39
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,960
因为当老师的马屁精被欺负过
because they were the teacher's pet?

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,910
感觉就像班上其他同学想要老师
It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald

41
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,280
忘了有考试
to forget the quiz.

42

第八季第二集

47
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,130
戴维斯小姐
Mrs. Davis.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,610
你猜是谁
Guess who?

49
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:15,980
库伯博士
Dr. Cooper.

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,070
没错  干得好
That's right, good job.

51
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,450
你好
Hello.

52
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,640
你想见我吗
Uh, you wanted to see me?

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,280
是的  欢迎回来
Yes. Uh, welcome back.

54
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,310
谢谢
Thank you.

55
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,410
我想你想要再开始
I assume you'd like to reopen our dialogue

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,330
大学逼我继续研究弦理论的谈话是吗
about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?

57
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,930
你是指谈话过程只有
You mean the dialogue that went,

58
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,870
"拜托""不行"这两个词来回重复的那次吗
"Please?" "No." "Please?" "No." "Please?" "No."

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,540
没错
That's the one.

60
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,510
我记得上一次最后是你回的  所以...  拜托
I believe you went last, so, uh, please?

61
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,890
库伯博士  在你不在的时候  我们想出了
Dr. Cooper, while you were away, we came up with a solution

62
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,390
让你可以改变研究领域的方法了
that would allow you to change your field of study.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,780
撅嘴逃跑真的管用啊
Pouting and running away actually worked.

64
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,180
不得不说  你可千万记得
Yeah, I must say, that may not be a lesson

65
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,930
不要再逼我干嘛了
you want to reinforce with me.

66
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,730
所以解决方式是什么
So, um, what is the solution?

67
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,820
目前大学给你的研究基金是
Currently, you're being paid under a grant

68
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,850
只能做特定领域研究的
to specifically research string theory.

69
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,160
如果我们将你升为初级教授
If we promote you to junior professor,

70
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,150
这样你就能
you'll be able to choose

71
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,140
想研究什么就研究什么
whatever field of research you'd like.

72
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:17,470
但如果我是教授  我就得带学生了
But if I'm a professor, then I'll have to teach a class.

73
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,790
没错
That is correct.

74
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,750
所以你的解决方法就是  给我升职  给我加薪
So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money

75
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,690
然后让我能把我的学识
so that I can impart my knowledge

76
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,770
传授给下一代的科学家们吗
to the next generation of scientists?

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,830
没错
Yes.

78
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,080
你们这帮人真变态
You people are sick.

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,800
准备好去吃午饭了吗
Hey. Ready to go to lunch?

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,840
再给我一分钟
Just give me a minute.

81
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,230
我在刺激海星的快感细胞
I'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish.

82
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,400
等我关了就行了
I just need to turn it off.

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
如果你不关掉会怎么样
What happens if you don't?

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,770
那我就得边吃午饭
Then I have to sit through lunch

85
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,480
边想着这海星过得比我还"爽"
knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,540
伯纳黛特会在餐厅跟我们碰面吗
Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?

87
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,480
不会  其实我没叫她
Uh, no. Actually, I didn't invite her.

88
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,380
为什么
How come?

89
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,420
自从她介绍了我这份工作
Well, ever since she helped me get this job,

90
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,120
她就一直不停地烦我
she won't stop bugging me.

91
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,410
她只想你能做好这份工作
Well, I think she just wants you to do well,

92
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,880
而且她也担心你会失败吧
and she's worried that you won't

93
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,330
因为你真是个超烂的服务员
'cause you were just a stunningly poor waitress.

94
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,540
才不是呢
That is not true.

95
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,830
我到现在都还在等两年前跟你点的玉米热狗呢
I'm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.

96
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,570
我跟你说了  很快会给你上
I told you, they'll be right out.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,160
好吧  没有伯纳黛特
Okay, so no Bernadette.

98
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,830
那晚你也看见她那个样子啦  难道是我错吗
Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?

99
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,370
没有啊  我只是...
No, I just...

100
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,390
我觉得这样说她有点不好
I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this.

101
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,830
通常有人在背后说其他人坏话时
Usually when someone's being talked about behind their back,

102
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,630
都是说我的坏话  而且还当着我的面说
it's me and it's right in front of my face.

103
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,140
抱歉  我只是想躲开她一阵子
I-I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.

104
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,460
我懂
I understand.

105
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,120
你知道吗  有些研究显示
You know, there is some research that indicates

106
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,230
分享对第三方的负面看法
that sharing negative attitudes about a third party

107
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:49,420
能够加深两个朋友之间的友谊吗
can be a powerful bonding force between two friends.

108
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,020
所以你是什么意思
So, what are you saying?

109
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,820
我的意思是  为了科学
I'm saying, in the spirit of science,

110
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,600
那个小婊砸到底有啥好不满的
what is that little skank's problem?

111
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,990
我一直想给
So, I've been trying to come up

112
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,490
我和艾米丽取一个可爱的情侣昵称
with a cute couple's nickname for me and Emily.

113
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:06,620
你觉得哪一个好
What do you like better--

114
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,130
艾米帕里
Emippali...

115
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,460
还是库萨帕米丽
or Koothrapemily?

116
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,380
为什么一定是你的姓和她的名的组合
Why is it your last name and her first name?

117
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,910
她姓斯威尼
Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney,

118
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,480
库萨帕威尼听起来不大对劲儿
[peeney音同peeny  鸡鸡的意思]
and something just didn't seem right about Koothrapeeney.

119
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,450
跟人力资源部谈得怎么样了
Hey, how'd it go with human resources?

120
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,660
很糟糕
Awful.

121
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,050
虽然他们同意让我研究其他理论
Yeah, they're allowing me to move on from string theory,

122
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,880
但是他们升我当初级教授
but they made me a junior professor

123
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,110
还让我去上课
and are requiring me to teach a class.

124
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,980
我不明白了  上课有什么不好
I don't understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?

125
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,240
愚蠢的问题
What a stupid question.

126
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,490
学生们绝对会"喜欢"他
The kids are gonna love him.

127
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,620
我不敢相信我得浪费我的时间
I can't believe I have to waste my time

128
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,710
照顾一群研究生
babysitting a bunch of grad students

129
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,590
他们可能觉得暗物质就是尿片里的屎尿
who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.

130
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,580
没那么糟糕
This might not be that bad.

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,450
你喜欢指出别人的错误
Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.

132
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,530
错
Wrong!

133
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,950
我喜欢这么做  并不代表我会想整天这么做
Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.

134
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,880
你喜欢给别人打分
You enjoy giving people grades.

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,350
观点正确  但是非原创  B-  
A valid point, but unoriginal-- B-minus.

136
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,140
你喜欢你自己的声音
And you love the sound of your own voice.

137
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,800
对  没错  我喜欢
Yeah, well, of course I do.

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,810
听听
Listen to it.

139
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,640
就像听到了融化的焦糖
It's like an earful of melted caramel.

140
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,590
最重要的是
Look, most importantly,

141
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,370
这样你才能继续研究暗物质
this will let you move on and study dark matter.

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,420
我有很多偶像倒是都曾给予过
It is true that many of my heroes have taken students

143
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,600
学生帮助[放在翅膀下]
under their wings:

144
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,110
费因曼  爱因斯坦  X教授
Feynman, Einstein, Professor X.

145
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,110
{\an8}费因曼  美国著名物理学家
X教授  即查尔斯・塞维尔  X战警学校的校长及创办人

146
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,370
有趣的是
Humorously,

147
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,800
对于X教授来说
in the case of Professor X,

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,370
他的一些学生还真的有翅膀
some of his students actually had wings.

149
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,820
真有意思
That's rich.

150
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,730
等全班学生在期中考试挂科之后
I'll use that one to lighten the mood

151
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,490
我会用这个笑话来逗笑他们
after my entire class fails the midterm.

152
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,580
通过使用1.2摩尔的快感细胞刺激
Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to

153
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,640
测量海星的血清素等级
one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells.

154
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,860
你喜欢这样对吧
You like that, don't you?

155
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,660
没错  说我的名字
That's right, say my name.

156
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,870
-还好吗  -还行
- Hey, what's going on? - Not much.

157
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,200
等会儿要去喝一杯吗
You want to get a drink later?

158
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,380
就我俩
Just the two of us?

159
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,340
不叫佩妮吗
No Penny?

160
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,810
今晚不叫她  我对她有点失望
Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.

161
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,430
因为你帮她找到工作
Because you got her the job and you think

162
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,590
你觉得她应该好好准备
she should be working harder to prepare for it?

163
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,300
原来不光是我  你也看到了
So it's not just me. You see it, too!

164
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,480
对  我也看到了
I do, I see it.

165
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,080
快把我逼疯了
It's driving me crazy.

166
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
今天下午  我在她的相册里看见
Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram

167
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,420
她没有好好学习  还跑出去吃午餐  
that instead of studying, she went out to lunch

168
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,180
还去做了美甲
and got a manicure.

169
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,060
太过分了
That's outrageous!

170
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,890
对啊
I know!

171
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,090
如果她做不好
If she doesn't do well,

172
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,490
也会坏了你的名声
th-this could reflect poorly on you.

173
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,230
是啊  她是不知道  还是不在乎
Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?

174
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,480
我不知道
I don't know.

175
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,960
重要的是  我支持你
The important thing is I am here for you

176
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,990
所以我们可以一起鄙视这个讨厌的第三方
so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.

177
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,800
我们来看看你的课上得怎么样了  
Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going.

178
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,180
学生呢
Where is everybody?

179
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:08,120
没有学生
There is no class.

180
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,100
你这么快就把所有人都送去校长办公室了吗
Did you send everyone to the principal's office already?

181
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,580
没人报名
No one signed up.

182
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,770
这不是你的错
Well, that's not your fault.

183
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,750
我打电话问学院秘书是怎么回事
I called the department secretary to see what happened.

184
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,450
显然  全校的人都认为我很讨厌    
Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious.

185
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,080
不会吧
What?

186
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,220
谢尔顿  真是抱歉
Hey, Sheldon, I'm sorry.

187
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,770
别  没事的
No, it's fine.

188
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,530
现在我可以全身心投入到暗物质的研究中了
Now I can devote all my time to dark matter.

189
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,780
你还给大家带了饼干
Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?

190
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,810
对  "无花果牛顿"饼干  
Oh, yes. Fig Newtons.

191
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,830
我本来打算问他们  哪个科学家
I was going to ask them: which scientist both helped

192
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,680
既对微积分有贡献   
to develop calculus

193
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,360
又有一款饼干以他命名
and had a famous cookie named after him?

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
等有人回答"牛顿"
And then after someone said "Newton,"

195
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,130
我就告诉他们错了
I was going to tell them they're wrong.

196
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,310
这个饼干是用马萨诸塞州的一个镇命名的
The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts.

197
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,970
然后我再把饼干扔了
And then I'd throw the cookies away.

198
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,280
我来听你的课怎么样
Hey, what if I took your class?

199
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,920
你为什么这么做
Why would you do that?

200
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,760
-你为什么这么做  -你脑子出什么问题
- Yeah, why would you do that? - What's wrong with you?

201
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,060
我想拿到博士学位
I'm thinking about getting my doctorate,

202
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,570
他想要教课  正好啊
and he wants to teach-- why not?

203
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,410
霍华德
Oh, Howard.

204
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,100
感谢你的提议
I appreciate the gesture,

205
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,220
但这是研究生阶段的物理课程
but this is a graduate-level physics class.

206
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,020
我觉得你根本无法理解
I don't think you'd understand

207
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,260
我所讲的任何内容
a single thing I was talking about.

208
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,430
再问一遍为什么不能来  我有答案了
Ask why not again; I've got an answer.

209
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,600
谢尔顿  我的智商来听你的课绰绰有余了
Sheldon, I'm more than smart enough to take your class.

210
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,060
不可能
No.

211
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,560
真的
Yes.

212
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,240
在没有精确解的情况下
How would you determine the ground state

213
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,190
你如何确定量子系统的基态
of a quantum system with no exact solution?

214
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,650
我会任意猜测一个基态波函数  通过更改其参数
I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters

215
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,000
找出能量最低的量子态
until I found the lowest energy solution.

216
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,470
你知道怎么不查书也能求出
Do you know how to integrate X squared times E

217
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,690
x平方乘e到负x的积分
to the minus X, without looking it up?

218
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,460
我会用费曼的秘诀
I'd use Feynman's trick--

219
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,330
积分符合内取微分
differentiate under the integral sign.

220
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,170
不错嘛
Okay.

221
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,630
量子力学的正确诠释是什么
What is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?

222
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,730
每一种诠释对于每一次测量
Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer

223
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,480
给出的答案都一样  所以它们同等正确
to every measurement, they are all equally correct.

224
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,810
但是我知道你支持的是多宇宙诠释
However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation,

225
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,020
所以我会顺着你说  现在你觉得我够聪明了吗
so I'll say that. Now do you think I'm smart enough?

226
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,510
不
No.

227
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,920
拜托  你也许就比我
Oh, come on. You might've gone to school

228
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,810
多上了几年学  但是
for a couple more years than me, but guess what--

229
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,340
工程师和物理学家一样聪明
engineers are just as smart as physicists.

230
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,190
你把这话收回去
You take that back!

231
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,210
不
No.

232
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,860
和伯纳黛特喝了几杯后
So, after drinks with Bernadette,

233
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,850
我刚到家  佩妮就打来电话抱怨伯纳黛特
I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her.

234
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,930
我正和佩妮说着呢
And then while I'm talking to Penny,

235
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,390
伯纳黛特又发来短信
I get a text from Bernadette.

236
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,440
我正为霍华德准备教学计划呢
Wh... I'm trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard.

237
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,280
你干嘛告诉我这些废话
Why are you telling me this?

238
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:58,940
因为虽然晚了15年  
Because it's taken 15 years,

239
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,630
但高中生活终于开始精彩了
but high school is finally awesome!

240
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,030
虽然我爱她们俩
I love them both,

241
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,460
但现在我成了团体中心  我更爱这种感觉
but I'm in the center now, and I love that even more.

242
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,800
艾米  拜托  我正努力寻找
Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way

243
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,320
一种用智力阉割我好友的方法
to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine.

244
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,100
-可人家...  -别烦我了
- But I'm just... - Not now.

245
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,760
注意你的态度  老弟
You better watch that attitude, buddy.

246
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,830
你女朋友现在可是校园红人呢
You're dating the popular girl now.

247
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,000
你起晚了
You're up late.

248
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,920
我在为沃罗威茨量身定制教学计划
Oh, I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz.

249
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,990
保证他跟听天书一样
He is going to be so lost.

250
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,320
快看这部分内容
Look at this section over here.

251
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,840
连我都不懂是什么
Even I don't really understand it.

252
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,180
谢尔顿  你为什么要这么做
Sheldon, why are you doing this?

253
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,710
我是一名教师  莱纳德
I'm a teacher, Leonard.

254
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,040
这是我的工作
It's my job.

255
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,190
不  我是说
No, I-I mean,

256
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,580
你为什么要费尽周折
why are you going to so much trouble

257
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,540
来证明你比沃罗威茨聪明呢
to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?

258
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,030
完全不费劲  我高兴着呢
Oh, it's no trouble; it's actually a pleasure.

259
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,380
你知道我怎么想吗
You want to know what I think?

260
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,720
我觉得一想到某人可能和你一样聪明
I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you,

261
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,520
甚至比你聪明  你就怕得要死
or even smarter, scares the pants off you,

262
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,150
你接受不了这个事实
and you can't deal with it.

263
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,660
想法很有趣
Interesting point.

264
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,630
你是在暗示
Wh... You're suggesting

265
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,900
潜意识里我的情绪
that I have emotional issues below my consciousness

266
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,770
影响了我的行动
which drive my behavior,

267
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,910
导致我大肆打击任何
thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone

268
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,900
威胁到我智商优势的人或事吗
that threatens my intellectual superiority.

269
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,170
你好好思考一下吧
Might be something to think about.

270
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,100
-莱纳德  -什么
- Leonard? - Yeah.

271
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,630
霍华德对花生过敏
Howard's allergic to peanuts.

272
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,310
我怎样才能用这个对付他
How can I use that against him?

273
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,820
既然大家都来齐了  我们可以上课了
Okay, now that everyone's here, we can begin.

274
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,570
上课之前我要说  我刚和莱纳德谈过了
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard.

275
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,020
如果你准备
And if you're gonna

276
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,300
刻意让这门课难到超乎常理
spend all your time trying to belittle me

277
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,250
以此来贬低我的智商的话
by making this class unnecessarily hard,

278
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,210
那我不上了
then I'm out.

279
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,330
但如果你真心想要
But if you're interested in making

280
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,030
做好一个老师
a sincere effort to be a good teacher,

281
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,360
那我也愿意给你个机会
then I'm willing to give this a shot.

282
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,740
这个提议很合理
I suppose that's a fair request.

283
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,020
我们俩都可以从这件事里受益
There's no reason we both can't benefit from this experience.

284
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,080
-好吧  -就这样
- Okay. - Okay.

285
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,750
那我们先上课
Well, then, uh, first things first.

286
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,790
你对最速降线问题熟悉吗
Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?

287
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,090
-很熟悉  -很好
- I am. - Good.

288
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,720
那它和变分法之间的关系呢
And how it relates to the calculus of variations?

289
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,270
是一条翻转摆线
It's an inverted cycloid.

290
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,190
不错不错
Wonderful.

291
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,550
那么  你了解欧拉拉格朗日定理吗
Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?

292
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,010
这我就有点小困惑了
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.

293
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,920
我就知道  好了
Ha! I knew it! All right.

294
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,740
在第一次考试前  我们需要大量补充这方面的知识
We have a lot of information to cover before your first test.

295
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,130
对了  考试就在8分钟之后
Which, by the way, is in eight minutes.

296
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,790
好消息是我的评分标准是看你画的曲线
The good news is I'm grading on a curve,

297
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,020
所以你卷子上肯定有个"C"
