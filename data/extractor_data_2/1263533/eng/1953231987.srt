1
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,030
(FATHER): <i>I hope, my dear,
you have ordered a good dinner today,</i>


2
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:16,994
because I have reason to expect
an addition to our family party.


3
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,455
Mr Bingley!


4
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:23,459
Why, Jane, you sly thing,
you never dropped a word!


5
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,919
(MOTHER): And no fish to be got!


6
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:29,840
Lydia, my love, ring the bell.
I must speak to Hill!


7
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,135
It is not Mr Bingley.


8
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:36,847
It is a person I never saw
in the whole course of my life.


9
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,892
- Colonel Forster!
- Captain Carter!


10
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,268
No, I know. Denny!


11
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,568
About a month ago
I received this letter.


12
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,946
About a fortnight ago, I answered it,


13
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,492
for it was a case of some delicacy,
requiring early attention.


14
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,411
It is from my cousin, Mr Collins,


15
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,167
who, when I am dead, may turn you all
out of this house as soon as he pleases.


16
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,712
Oh, my dear,
pray don't mention that odious man!


17
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,797
It is the hardest thing in the world,


18
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,468
that your estate should be
entailed away from your children.


19
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,970
Indeed, my dear,
nothing can clear Mr Collins


20
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,306
of the iniquitous crime
of inheriting Longbourn,


21
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,183
but if you'Il listen to his letter,


22
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,478
you may be softened
by how he expresses himself.


23
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,523
''My dear sir,


24
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:32,569
''the disagreement subsisting between
yourself and my late honoured father''


25
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,030
''always gave me much uneasiness,


26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,033
''and since I have had
the misfortune to lose him... ''


27
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,535
(LYDIA SNORTS)


28
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,666
'' ..to lose him, I have frequently wished
to heal the breach. ''


29
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:50,462
There, Mrs Bennet. ''My mind, however,
is now made up on the subject... ''


30
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:53,507
(COLLINS): <i>..for,
having received my ordination at Easter,</i>


31
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,176

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,556

00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,409

44
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:46,143

45
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,312

46
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,523
<i>of waiting on you and
your family on Monday the 18th...</i>


47
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,276
Have care, Dawkins!


48
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,237
<i>..and shall probably
trespass on your hospitality</i>


49
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,489

50
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,744

at 35 minutes past ten,</i>

00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,416
<i>and thence to Watford,</i>


53
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,337
<i>from whence I shall engage
a hired carriage to Longbourn.</i>


54
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:19,301
<i>Where, God willing, you may expect me
by four in the afternoon.</i>


55
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,053
And here he comes.


56
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,431
He must be an oddity, don't you think?


57
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,601
If he's disposed
to make our girls any amends,


58
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,853
I shan't be the person
to discourage him.


59
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:33,774
- Can he be a sensible man, sir ?
- I think not, my dear.


60
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:39,029
Indeed, I have great hopes
of finding him quite the reverse.


61
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,535
(FATHER): Mr Collins!


62
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,371
You are very welcome!


63
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:59,132
My dear Mr and Mrs Bennet!


64
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,474
(FATHER): You seem very...


65
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,228
..fortunate in your patroness, sir.


66
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,439
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.


67
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,067
Indeed I am, sir.


68
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,196
I have been treated with
such affability, such condescension,


69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,074
as I would never have dared to hope for.


70
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:29,246
I have been invited twice
to dine at Rosings Park.


71
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,417
That so? Amazing.


72
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,503
Does she live near you, sir ?


73
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,673
The garden,
in which stands my humble abode,


74
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:43,468
is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park.


75
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:47,639
Only a lane, eh ? F ancy that, Lizzy.


76
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,814
I think you said she was a widow, sir ?
Has she any family?


77
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,566
She has one daughter, ma'am.


78
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,945
The heiress of Rosings,
and of very extensive property.


79
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,740
And has she been presented at court?


80
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,703
She is unfortunately
of a sickly constitution


81
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,205
which unhappily
prevents her being in town.


82
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:17,544
And by that means,
as I told Lady Catherine myself one day,


83
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:22,799
she has deprived the British Court
of its brightest ornament.


84
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,219
You may imagine, sir, how happy I am


85
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,014
on every occasion to offer
those little delicate compliments,


86
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,475
which are always acceptable to ladies.


87
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,228
That is fortunate for you,


88
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:40,400
that you possess such an extraordinary
talent for flattering with delicacy.


89
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,404
May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions


90
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:47,073
proceed from the impulse of the moment,


91
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,744
or are they the result
of previous study?


92
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:55,624
They arise chiefly
from what is passing at the time, sir.


93
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,127
I do sometimes amuse myself
by writing down


94
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,463
and arranging such little compliments


95
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,508
as may be adapted to ordinary occasions.


96
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,386
But I try to give them
as unstudied an air as possible.


97
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,846
Excellent.


98
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:12,974
(FATHER): Excellent.


99
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,785
(COLLINS): I must confess myself
quite overwhelmed


100
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,995
with the charms of your daughters.


101
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,291
Oh, you're very kind, sir. They are
sweet girls, though I say it myself.


102
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,629
Perhaps especially the eldest
Miss Bennet?


103
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,007
Ah, yes, Jane is admired
wherever she goes.


104
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,468
But I think I should tell you,


105
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,930
I think it very likely
she will be very soon engaged.


106
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,600
- Ah.
- As for my younger daughters,


107
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,310
if any of them...


108
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,814
In their case
I know of no prior attachment at all.


109
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,107
Ah.


110
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:18,331
We're going to Meryton
to see if Denny is returned from town!


111
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,043
Perhaps you would care
for a little exercise, Mr Collins ?


112
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,422
Indeed I would, Mrs Bennet.


113
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,466
Cousin Elizabeth !


114
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:35,140
Would you do me the great honour
of walking with me into town?


115
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:49,154
(COLLINS): You visit your Aunt Philips
in Meryton frequently, I understand?


116
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,989
(LIZZY): Yes, she is fond of company,


117
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,366
but you'Il find her gatherings
poor affairs


118
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,285
after the splendours of Rosings Park.


119
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,581
No, I think not.
I believe I possess the happy knack,


120
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,875
much to be desired in a clergyman,


121
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:06,922
of adapting myself to every kind
of society, whether high or low.


122
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,049
That is fortunate indeed.


123
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,177
Yes, indeed,
and though it is a gift of nature,


124
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,972
constant study has enabled me,
I flatter myself,


125
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,308
to make a kind of art of it.


126
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,917
There! I'm sure that's new in
since Friday.


127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,419
Isn't it nice?
Don't you think I'd look well in it?


128
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:49,005
- Not as well as me. Come on!
- No, I shan't.


129
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,425
Jane! Come here. Look at this!


130
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,637
Jane, I'm determined
to have this bonnet!


131
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,973
Look, there's Denny!


132
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,059
- Where ?
- There. Look!


133
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,688
- (KITTY): Who's with him?
- (LYDIA): Don't know.


134
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,231
(KITTY): He's handsome!


135
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,857
(LYDIA): He might be
if he were in regimentals.


136
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,235
A man looks nothing without regimentals!


137
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,112
They're looking over.


138
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,656
Lizzy, isn't he mightily good-looking?


139
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,242
- Denny!
- Lydia!


140
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,791
We thought you were still in town!


141
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,127
There was nothing amusing enough
to hold us there.


142
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,046
May I introduce my friend
George Wickham?


143
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,800
Miss Bennet, Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
Miss Mary Bennet,


144
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,554
Miss Catherine Bennet
and Miss Lydia Bennet.


145
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,806
This is our cousin, Mr Collins.


146
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,226
Do you stay long in Meryton, Mr Wickham?


147
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,562
All winter, I'm happy to say.


148
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,815
I've taken a commission
in Colonel Forster's regiment.


149
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,443
There, Lydia!
He will be dressed in regimentals.


150
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,654
And lend them much distinction,
I dare say.


151
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,614
Outswagger us all, eh, Wickham?


152
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,284
You misrepresent me
to these young ladies.


153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,578
Shall you come with us
to Aunt Philips tonight?


154
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:03,872
-(KITTY): Denny is coming!


155
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,290
(LYDIA): It's only supper and cards.


156
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,294
I haven't been invited
by Mr and Mrs Philips.


157
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,796
(LYDIA): No one cares
about that nowadays!


158
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,841
(WICKHAM): If Mrs Philips
extended the invitation to include me,


159
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,509
I should be delighted.


160
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,598
(KITTY): Look, Jane. It's Mr Bingley!


161
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:31,107
How very fortunate! We were on our way
to Longbourn to ask after your health.


162
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:35,737
(JANE): You're very kind, sir.
I'm quite recovered, as you see.


163
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,281
(BINGLEY): Yes.
I'm very glad to know it.


164
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,638
- Look, there's Denny!
- And Chamberlayne.


165
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,101
(COLLINS): ..such a variety
of social intercourse.


166
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,314
What a charming apartment you have here,
Mrs Philips.


167
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,567
Upon my word, it reminds me greatly


168
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,237
of the small summer breakfast room
at Rosings!


169
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,825
Does it indeed, sir ?
I'm much obliged to you, I'm sure.


170
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,578
I'm sure Mr Collins
wishes to pay a compliment, Aunt.


171
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,330
Does he ? I see.


172
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:33,419
Rosings Park, we must understand,
is very grand indeed.


173
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,963
Indeed it is!


174
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,259
My dear Madam,
if you thought I intended any slight


175
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,304
on your excellent and very comfortable
arrangements, I am mortified!


176
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,350
Rosings Park is the residence
of my noble patroness,


177
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,019
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.


178
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,647
Oh, now I understand.


179
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,316
(COLLINS): The chimney piece
in the second drawing room alone


180
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,443
cost 800 pounds!


181
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:01,197
(MRS PHILIPS): Now I see,
there's no offence at all.


182
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,995
Will you oblige me and sit down
to a game of whist?


183
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,664
I must confess
I know little of the game, madam,


184
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,500
but I shall be glad to improve myself.


185
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,754
If my fair cousin
will consent to release me?


186
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,090
With all my heart, sir.


187
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,363
Oh, Mr Collins!


188
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:47,285
- What were trumps again?
- Hearts, Mr Collins! Hearts.


189
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,721
I must confess I thought
I' d never escape your younger sisters.


190
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,059
They can be very determined.
Lydia especially.


191
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,686
But they're pleasant girls.


192
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,815
I find that society in Hertfordshire
quite exceeds my expectations.


193
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,278
I don't see Mr Bingley
and his friends here.


194
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,367
I think some of Mr Bingley's friends
would consider it beneath their dignity.


195
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,118
Really?


196
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,082
Have you known Mr Darcy long?


197
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,461
- About a month.
- I've known him all my life.


198
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,674
- We played together as children.
- But...


199
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,676
Yes, you're surprised.


200
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,554
Perhaps you noticed the cold manner
of our greeting?


201
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,641
I confess I did.


202
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,269
Do you...


203
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,982
Are you much acquainted with Mr Darcy?


204
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,987
As much as I ever wish to be.


205
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,239
I've spent three days
in the same house with him,


206
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,492
and I find him very disagreeable.


207
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:15,248
I fear there are few who would share
that opinion... except myself.


208
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,335
But he's not at all liked
in Hertfordshire.


209
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:22,422
Everybody is disgusted with his pride.


210
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,549
Do you know...


211
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,261
Does he intend to stay long
at Netherfield?


212
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,554
I do not know.


213
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,683
I hope his being in the neighbourhood
will not affect your plans to stay.


214
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:40,440
Thank you. But it is not for me
to be driven away by Mr Darcy.


215
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,608
If he wishes to avoid seeing me,
he must go.


216
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,445
We're not on friendly terms,


217
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:49,115
but I have no reason to avoid him
but one: he's done me great wrong.


218
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,621
His father, the late Mr Darcy,
was my Godfather,


219
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,665
and one of the best men
that ever breathed.


220
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,543
My father was his steward,


221
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,963
and when he died,
old Mr Darcy cared for me,


222
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,841
provided for me, loved me, I believe,


223
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,472
as though I were his own son.
He intended me for the church.


224
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,934
And it was my dearest wish
to enter into that profession.


225
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,399
But after he died, and the living
he' d promised me fell vacant,


226
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:28,905
the son refused point blank
to honour his father's promises.


227
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,368
And so, you see,
I have to make my own way in the world.


228
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,079
This is quite shocking!


229
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,539
I had not thought Mr Darcy
as bad as this.


230
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:43,294
To descend to such malicious revenge.
He deserves to be publicly disgraced!


231
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,838
Some day he will be, but not by me.


232
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,176
Till I can forget his father,
I can't defy or expose him.


233

(LYDIA LAUGHS)


234
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,311
(LIZZY): I wonder at the pride
of this man. How abominable!


235
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,815
You're more temperate
than I' d be in your situation.


236
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,777
Well, I have not the resentful temper
that some men have.


237
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,656
And my situation, you know,
is not so bad.


238
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,034
At present I have every cause for cheer!


239
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,161
I can't bear to be idle,


240
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,331
and my new profession
gives me active employment.


241
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,251
My fellow officers are excellent men.


242
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,505
And now I find myself in a society
as agreeable as any I've ever known.


243
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,884
I absolutely forbid you
to feel sorry for me!


244
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:35,388
Lizzy? Lizzy, why should you feel sorry
for Mr Wickham?


245
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,474
Why? Because...


246
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:42,770
Because I've not had a dance
these three months together!


247
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:46,399
Poor Mr Wickham!
Well, you shall have one now.

(MRS PHILIPS): Oh, Mr Collins!


250
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,089
I cannot believe it!


251
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,426
Mr Darcy's respect
for his father's wishes


252
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,970
wouldn't allow him to behave
in such an unchristian way.


253
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:21,309
Lizzy, consider, how could his most
intimate friends be so deceived in him?


254
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,105
I could more easily imagine Mr Bingley
being imposed upon,


255
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:29,025
than to think that Mr Wickham
could invent such a history!


256
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,904
I believe you like Mr Wickham, Lizzy.


257
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,742
I confess I <i>do </i>like him.


258
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,580
I do not see how anyone
could <i>not </i>like him.


259
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,876
There's something very open
and artless in his manner.


260
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,795
He feels deeply, I believe,


261
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:55,218
and yet has a natural merriment
and energy, despite all this.


262
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,430
Yes, Jane,
I confess I like him very much.


263
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,392
But after so short an acquaintance,


264
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,563
do you think we should believe in him
so implicitly?


265
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,565
How could he be doubted?


266
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:14,654
He gave me all the circumstances, Jane.
Names, facts.


267
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,949
And everything without ceremony.


268
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,826
Let Mr Darcy contradict it!


269
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,162
Besides, there was truth
in all his looks.


270
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,416
It is difficult, indeed.


271
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:33,422
It is distressing.
One does not know what to think.


272
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,469
I beg your pardon,
one knows <i>exactly</i> what to think!


273
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:44,308
(MOTHER): <i>Oh, girls! Girls, we have all
been invited to a ball at Netherfield!</i>


274
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,561
- I love a ball!
- So do I!


275
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,772
This will be a compliment to you, Jane,
you know.


276
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,318
The invitation includes you, Mr Collins.


277
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,574
But shall you accept, sir ?


278
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,243
Would it be entirely proper ?
Would your bishop approve?


279
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,913
Your scruples do you credit,
my dear cousin.


280
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,000
I am of the opinion
that a ball of this kind,


281
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,628
given by a man of good character
to respectable people,


282
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,464
can have no evil tendency.


283
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,969
And I am so far
from objecting to dancing myself,


284
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,554
that I shall hope to be honoured


285
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:25,766
with the hands of all my fair cousins
during the evening!


286
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,273
And I take this opportunity
of soliciting yours...


287
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:37,361
..Miss Elizabeth,
for the first two dances!

290
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:54,170
I dare say you'Il be able to imagine
the scope of the whole, Mr Wickham,


291

alone, in the second drawing room,

cost all of 800 pounds!


293
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:05,848
800 pounds, sir! I hazard a guess
it must be a very large one?


294
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,643
It is very large, indeed, sir.


295
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,646

How fortunate!
I must claim you for my sister Mary.


299
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:23,032
She's found a passage in Fordyce's
Sermons that she can't make out.

00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,700
Well, I...


301
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,662
I believe it is of
great doctrinal import, sir.

- In that case...
- You're very kind, sir.

Mr Collins' conversation is very...

00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,721
..wholesome.


306
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:49,141
And there is plenty to be had of it,
I assure you!

Mr Bingley's acquaintance yet?

No.

00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,652
But I'm disposed to approve of him.


310
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,155
He has issued a general invitation
to the officers for his ball,


311
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,783
which has caused great joy
in more than one quarter.


312
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,787
- He must be a very amiable gentleman.
- Oh, yes.


313
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,082
He is eager to approve
of everyone he meets,


314
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,835
but he's a sensible man,
with taste and judgement.


315
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,464
I wonder very much
how Mr Darcy could impose upon him.


316
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,633
He cannot know what Mr Darcy is.

Probably not.

00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,972
Mr Darcy can please what he chooses,
if he thinks it worth his while.

Among his equals
in wealth and consequence,


320
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,934
he can be liberal-minded,


321
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,187
honourable, even agreeable.


322
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,733
I wonder you can speak of him
so tolerantly.


323
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,443
He is not wholly bad.


324
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,992

00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:51,036
I wish I could call her amiable.


326
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,332
As a child, she was affectionate
and pleasing, and fond of me.


327
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,419
I've devoted hours to her amusement,


328
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:03,340
but she is grown too much
like her brother. Very... proud.


329
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,887
I never see her now. Since her father's
death, her home has been in London.

She is but 16 years old.

to Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

She's Mr Darcy's aunt, and her daughter
Anne, who will inherit a large fortune,

is destined to be Mr Darcy's bride.

00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,522
Ah, you look very well, Lizzy!


338
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,191
You'Il never be as pretty
as your sister Jane,


339
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,361
but I will say
you look very well indeed!


340
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,363
Thank you, mamma.


341
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,075
I hope you will pay Mr Collins
every courtesy tonight,


342
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,327
because he's been very attentive to you!


343
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:15,704
(KITTY): <i>Your gown
is very unbecoming, too!</i>


344
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,084
- Then I shall ask Lizzy!
- Lydia, what are you doing?


345
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,294
Go back in your room and dress yourself!


346
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,046
I have to ask Lizzy something!


347
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,343
Lizzy, look. What do you think?


348
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:31,846
Kitty says not,
but I think it becomes me very well.


349
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:35,099
- I wonder that you ask me.
- You look very nice.


350
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,392
Thank you.


351
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,019
Don't keep Wickham to yourself.


352
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,146
Kitty and I want to
dance with him as well.


353
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,649
I promise I shall not.
Even if I wished to, I could not.


354
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:47,361
I have to dance the first two
with Mr Collins.


355
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,155
Lord, yes.
He's threatened to dance with us all!

358
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:19,078
My dear Jane, how delightful to see you,
and so well recovered!


359
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,457
Louisa and I have been quite desolate
without you, haven't we?


360
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,334
- Mr Hurst?
- What?


361
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,088
- Oh, Mrs Bennet!
- Delighted.


362
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,422
Mr Bennet.


363
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,008
Mrs Bennet, Mr Bennet! Quite delighted.


364
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,261
- And <i>all </i>your daughters.
- There's Denny!


365
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,974
- And Chamberlayne!
- And my cousin Mr Collins.


366
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,811
(COLLINS): May I congratulate you on
your very elegant arrangements, ma'am?


367
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,980
(COLLINS): It puts me to mind
greatly of...


368
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,066
Perhaps you may have
visited Rosings Park?


369

Miss Bennet.


370
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:04,349
Miss Bennet. You look quite
remarkably well this evening.


371
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:05,559
Thank you.


372
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:09,688
I'm instructed to convey
my friend Wickham's regrets


373
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,149
that he cannot attend the ball.


374
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,902
He's gone to town
on a matter of urgent business,


375
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:19,114
which probably became urgent as
he wished to avoid a certain gentleman.


376
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,665
Denny! I hope you're prepared
to dance with us tonight!


377
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,292
Forgive the intrusion.


378
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:33,545
I would dance with both of your sisters
at once if I could, but...


379
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,297
Never mind that. Come on, Denny!


380
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,151
Charlotte!


381
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,821
I have so much to acquaint you with!


382
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:06,620
Charlotte, may I present our cousin,
Mr Collins? My friend, Miss Lucas.


383
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,164
- How do you do, sir ?
- Miss Lucas.


384
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:12,543
I'm indeed honoured
to meet any friend of my fair cousins.


385
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,254
So many agreeable young ladies!


386
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:17,256
I'm quite enraptured!


387
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,877
- Other way, Mr Collins!
- Madam, a thousand apologies...


388
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,045
My dear cousin, I apologize.


389

(THE MUSIC DROWNS MOTHER'S VOICE)


390
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,970
It's extraordinary!
Are you sure it's true?


391
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,638
Charlotte, how could it be otherwise?


392
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,181
Every circumstance confirms it.


393
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:34,434
And Mr Darcy has boasted to me
himself of his resentful....


394
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:36,603
- Lizzy!
- What?


395
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,944
If you're not otherwise engaged,


396
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,488
would you do me the honour
of dancing the next with me?


397
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,991
Why I... had not...


398
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,119
I thank you. Yes.


399
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,834
Why couldn't I think of an excuse?
Hateful man!


400
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,253
I promised myself
I' d never dance with him.


401
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,506
He pays you a great compliment
in singling you out, Lizzy.


402
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,427
Think what you are doing.
You' d be a simpleton


403
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,886
if you let your fancy for Wickham


404
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,348
lead you to slight a man
of ten times his consequence.


405
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,122
I believe we must have
<i>some </i>conversation, Mr Darcy.


406
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,126
A very little will suffice.


407
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,719
You should say
something about the dance, perhaps.


408
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,223
I might remark on the number of couples.


409
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,522
Do you talk by rule when you're dancing?


410
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,524
Sometimes it's best.


411
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,735
Then we may enjoy the advantage
of saying as little as possible.


412
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,455
Do you consult your own feelings
in this case, or seek to gratify mine?


413
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:07,671
Both, I imagine.


414
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,640
We are both unwilling to speak


415
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,393
unless we expect to say something
that will amaze the whole room.


416
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,647
This is no striking resemblance of
your own character, I'm sure.


417
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:18,116
- Do you often walk into Meryton?
- Yes, quite often.


418
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,291
When you met us, we had
just been forming a new acquaintance.


419
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,802
Mr Wickham's happy manners
enable him to make friends.


420
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:40,889
Whether he is equally capable
of keeping them, is less certain.


421
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,522
He has been unlucky
to lose your friendship


422
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,732
in a way he'Il suffer from all his life.


423
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,238
Allow me to congratulate you, sir!


424
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:59,032
Such superior dancing
is rarely to be seen.


425
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,744
I'm sure your fair partner
is well worthy of you.


426
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,038
I hope this pleasure is repeated often.


427
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:09,501
Especially when a certain
desirable event takes place.


428
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,752
Eh, Miss Lizzy?


429
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:14,214
What congratulations will then flow in!


430
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,340
Sir, I...


431
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,678
I understand! I'Il not detain you longer
from your bewitching partner!


432
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,931
A great pleasure, sir. Capital! Capital!


433
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:31,106
I remember hearing you once say
that you hardly ever forgave.


434
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,608
That your resentment once created
was implacable.


435
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:37,779
You're careful, aren't you,
in allowing resentment to be created?


436
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,947
I am.


437
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,296
And never allow yourself to be blinded
by prejudice?


438
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,007
I hope not.


439
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,676
May I ask to what these questions tend?


440
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,472
Merely to the illustration of your
character. I'm trying to make it out.


441
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,435
- What is your success?
- I don't get on at all.


442
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,230
I hear such different accounts of you
as to puzzle me exceedingly.


443
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:42,719
I wish that you wouldn't attempt
to sketch my character


444
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,054
at the present moment.


445
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,432
The performance should reflect no credit
on either of us.


446
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,728
If I don't take your likeness now,
I may never have another opportunity!


447
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,898
I would by no means suspend any pleasure
of yours.

(VOICES DROWNED IN PARTY SOUNDS)


450
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:25,720
Miss Eliza, I hear you're quite
delighted with George Wickham.


451
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:29,557
No doubt he forgot to tell you,
among his other communications,


452
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,268
that he was merely
the son of old Wickham,


453
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,479
the late Mr Darcy's steward!


454
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,609
But, Eliza, as a friend,


455
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:43,738
let me recommend you not to give credit
to all his assertions.


456
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,866
Wickham treated Darcy
in an infamous manner.


457
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,160
Has he? How?


458
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,663
I don't remember the particulars,


459
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:55,417
but I do know that Mr Darcy
was not in the least to blame.


460
00:38:56,835 --> 00:39:01,297
I pity you, Eliza, for the discovery
of your favourite's guilt,


461
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:05,468
but really, considering his descent,
one could not expect much better.


462
00:39:06,386 --> 00:39:10,265
His guilt and his descent
appear by your account to be the same.


463
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,310
You accuse him only of being
the son of Mr Darcy's steward,


464
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,104
which he informed me of himself.


465
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:17,939
I beg your pardon.


466
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,277
Excuse my interference.
It was kindly meant.


467
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,041
- Insolent girl!
- Lizzy!


468
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,793
I see nothing in her paltry attack


469
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,504
but her own ignorance
and the malice of Mr Darcy!


470
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,423
Yes, but Lizzy...


471
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,471
Mr Bingley said, that though
he doesn't know the whole history,


472
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:53,933
he fears that Mr Wickham
is by no means a respectable young man.


473
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,936
- Does he know Mr Wickham ?
- No.


474
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,814
Well, then he just had his account
from Mr Darcy.


475
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:05,487
I don't doubt Mr Bingley's sincerity.
Of course he would believe his friend.


476
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,322
As to the other two gentlemen,


477
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,575
I shall venture to think of them both
as I did before.

Shall we not have some music?
I have a great desire for a song!

But they haven't been introduced!


490

- Can we not prevent him?
- Too late.


491
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:33,116
Mr Darcy. I have made a remarkable...
I must say, an amazing discovery!

I understand that you are the nephew


493

of Rosings Park!


494
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:43,126
Mr Darcy, I am happy
to be able to inform you


495
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,004
that her Ladyship
was in the best of health...

..eight days ago.

00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,759
I'm glad to hear it.


498
00:41:56,139 --> 00:42:00,935
- And what is your name, sir ?
- My name is William Collins, Mr Darcy.


499

And I have a very great honour to...


500
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,443

# My Mother bids me bind my hair


507
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:59,160
# With bands of rosy hue


508
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,332
That'Il do extremely well, child.
You've delighted us long enough.


509
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:09,587
Let the other young ladies
have time to exhibit.


510
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,765
If I were so fortunate
as to be able to sing,


511
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:25,395
I should have great pleasure
in obliging the company with an air.


512
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:31,609
Indeed I should, for I consider music
as a very innocent diversion,


513
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:35,697
and perfectly compatible
with the profession of a clergyman!


514
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,263
Mr Collins is such a sensible,
respectable young man.


515
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:03,016
He's taken quite a fancy to Lizzy,


516
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,977
and I don't think
he could find a better wife.


517
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:10,481
He favoured Jane at first,
but Bingley was there before him.


518
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,359
Now <i>there </i>will be a great marriage!


519
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:18,990
And, of course, that will throw the
girls into the path of other rich men!


520
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,326
(DENNY): Lydia!


521
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,120
(DENNY): Lydia!


522
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,205
Lydia!


523
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,882
Lord! Denny, fetch me a glass of wine.
I can scarce draw breath, I'm so fagged!


524
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,186
(KITTY): ...and Chamberlayne
and Denny again!


525
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,188
Lydia only danced with him twice!


526
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,691
- I thought Mary sang very ill.
- Oh, yes. Poor Mary.


527
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,445
- But she is determined to do it.
- More fool her, I say.


528
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,490
Mr Collins trod on my frock and tore it.


529
00:45:00,573 --> 00:45:01,783
(MOTHER): Lizzy!


530
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,662
Mr Collins, I'm sure
there can be no objection!


531
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,040
Kitty, don't leave me.


532
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,043
- Lizzy, dear!
- (KITTY): Why? It's only Mr Collins.


533
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,004
Come, Kitty. I want you upstairs.


534
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,548
Mr Collins has something
to say to Lizzy!


535
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:20,885
Dear Mamma, don't go.


536
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:24,097
Mr Collins can have nothing to say
that anyone could not hear.


537
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:30,812
Lizzy. I insist that you stay
where you are and hear Mr Collins!


538
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,649
Come, Kitty! Come along.


539
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,705
Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth,


540
00:45:49,831 --> 00:45:53,835
that your modesty adds
to your other perfections.


541
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,672
But you can hardly doubt the object
of my discourse,


542
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:01,843
however your feminine delicacy
may lead you to dissemble.


543
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,597
For, as almost as soon
as I entered the house,


544
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,853
I singled you out as the companion
of my future life!


545
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:17,191
But before I am run away by my feelings
on this subject,


546
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:24,323
perhaps it would be advisable for me
to state my reasons for marrying.


547
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,200
Mr Collins...


548
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,667
My reasons for marrying are:


549
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,337
First, I think it a right thing
for every clergyman


550
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:41,048
to set the example of matrimony
in his parish.


551
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:46,804
Secondly, that I am convinced it will
add very greatly to my happiness.


552
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:52,059
And thirdly, which perhaps I should have
mentioned first,


553
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,104
that it is the particular recommendation


554
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:58,733
of my noble patroness
Lady Catherine de Bourgh!


555
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,486
''Mr Collins, '' she said,
''you must marry. ''


556
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:06,824
''Choose properly, '' she said.
''Choose a gentlewoman for my sake, ''


557
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,578
''and for your own, let her be an active,
useful sort of person,


558
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,497
''not brought up too high. ''


559
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,500
''Find such a woman as soon as you can,


560
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:20,379
''bring her to Hunsford,
and I will visit her!''


561
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:25,134
And your wit and vivacity,


562
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:28,054
I think, must be acceptable to her,


563
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:30,723
when tempered
with the silence and respect


564
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,100
which her rank will inevitably excite.


565
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:36,062
Yes.


566
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,483
So much for my general intention
in favour of matrimony.


567
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,944
Now, as to my particular choice:


568
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,279
My dear cousin,


569
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:50,993
being, as I am, to inherit all this
estate after the death of your father,


570
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,579
I could not satisfy myself


571
00:47:53,663 --> 00:47:57,124
without resolving to choose a wife
from among his daughters.


572
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,674
And now nothing remains,


573
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,929
but to assure you,
in the most animated language,


574
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:12,807
of the violence of my affections!


575
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:17,311
- Mr Collins, please...
- To fortune I am perfectly indifferent.


576
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,565
I'm well aware that 1,000 pounds
in the four per cents


577
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,651
is all that you may be entitled to,


578
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:29,156
but rest assured, I shall never reproach
on that score when we are married!


579
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,493
You are too hasty, sir!


580
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,206
You forget that I've made no answer.
Let me do so now.


581
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,334
I thank you for your compliments.


582
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:44,130
I am very sensible of the honour
of your proposals, but...


583
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,383
..it is impossible for me
to accept them.


584
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:59,228
I am by no means discouraged.
Indeed not.


585
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,356
I understand that young ladies


586
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,193
often reject the addresses of the man
they mean to accept,


587
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:08,279
when he first applies for their favour,


588
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,949
and therefore I shall hope,
my dear cousin,


589
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,869
to lead you to the altar before long.


590
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,289
Upon my word,
your hope is an extraordinary one


591
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,874
in view of my declaration.


592
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:24,378
I was perfectly serious in my refusal.


593
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,759
You could not make me happy, and I am
the last woman who could make you so.


594
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:31,719
My dear Miss Elizabeth,


595
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:37,433
my situation in life, my connection
with the noble family of de Bourgh,


596
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,603
are circumstances highly in my favour.


597
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,648
Consider that it is by no means certain


598
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,985
that another offer of marriage
may be made to you.


599
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:51,739
You cannot be serious in your rejection.


600
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:57,328
I must attribute it to your wish
of increasing my love by suspense,


601
00:49:57,787 --> 00:50:00,915
in the usual manner of elegant females.


602
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,918
I assure you, sir,


603
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,712
that I have no pretensions
to the kind of elegance


604
00:50:06,796 --> 00:50:10,299
which consists in
tormenting a respectable man.


605
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,177
I thank you
for the honour of your proposals,


606
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,097
but to accept them
is absolutely impossible.


607
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,266
My feelings forbid it in every respect.


608
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:24,939
- Can I speak plainer ?
- You are uniformly charming!


609
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:32,363
And I am persuaded that when sanctioned
by your excellent parents...


610
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:40,746
..my proposals will not fail
of being acceptable.


611
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:50,089
Oh, Mr Bennet!
You are wanted immediately.


612
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:52,299
We are all in uproar!


613
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:58,055
You must come and make Lizzy marry
Mr Collins. She vows she won't have him,


614
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:02,768
and if you don't make haste, Mr Collins
will change his mind and won't have her!


615
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:07,022
I have not the pleasure of understanding
you. Of what are you talking?


616
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:11,402
Of Mr Collins and Lizzy!


617
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:15,322
Lizzy declares
she will not have Mr Collins,


618
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,284
and Mr Collins begins to say
he will not have Lizzy!


619
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:22,288
What am I to do on the occasion?
It seems a hopeless business.


620
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:25,249
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself!


621
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,627
Tell her you insist
upon her marrying him!


622
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:33,007
Let her come in.


623
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,471
Lizzy! Lizzy!


624
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,931
Your father wishes to speak to you.


625
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:47,605
Come here, my child.


626
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,403
I...


627
00:51:55,696 --> 00:51:59,617
I understand Mr Collins has made you
an offer of marriage.


628
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,703
- Is this true ?
- Y es, sir.


629
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,292
Very well. And this offer of marriage
you have refused?


630
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,878
- I have.
- (FA THER): I see.


631
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:13,839
Right, we now come to the point.


632
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:18,052
Your mother insists
on your accepting it.


633
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:24,433
- Is it not so, Mrs Bennet?
- Yes, or I will never see her again!


634
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,395
An unhappy alternative
is before you, Elizabeth.


635
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,358
From this day you must be a stranger
to one of your parents.


636
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,655
Your mother will never see you again
if you do not marry Mr Collins.


637
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:39,782
And...


638
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,619
..I will never see you again if you <i>do.</i>


639
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:48,791
Oh, Mr Bennet!


640
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:03,556
(MOTHER): <i>Sit down, Miss Lizzy!
I insist upon you marrying Mr Collins!</i>


641
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:08,185
- Why, Charlotte, what do you do here?
- I am come to see Elizabeth.


642
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:14,733
Mr Collins has made Lizzy an offer, and
what do you think? She won't have him!


643
00:53:15,776 --> 00:53:19,613
Then I am very sorry for him,
though I couldn't say I'm surprised.


644
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:22,825
(MOTHER): <i>If you don't,
I will never speak to you again!</i>


645
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,789
- I won't discuss the matter any longer.
- Mr Collins!


646
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,252
Mamma's beside herself.
He says he won't stay another night.


647
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,630
I wonder, should I invite him
to dine with us ?


648
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,509
Aye, do! Do! Take him away and feed him.


649
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:42,886
For he's been in high dudgeon
all morning!


650
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:56,817
- Oh, Mr Collins!
- I am resigned.


651
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:01,238
Resignation is never so perfect,


652
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,908
as when the blessing denied
begins to lose somewhat of its value


653
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:06,201
in our estimation.


654
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,663
Until tomorrow then, madam.


655
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:15,544
I take my leave.


656
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,509
Oh, Mr Collins!
