00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,110
噢 对不起 福尔摩斯
Oh, sorry Holmes.

6
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:53,319
不 不
No, no,

7
00:04:55,468 --> 00:04:57,239
你来得正是时候
you couldn't have come at a better time.

8
00:04:57,836 --> 00:04:59,938
我怕你正忙呢
I was afraid you were engaged.

9
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:02,013
是的 非常忙
I am, very much so.

10
00:05:02,097 --> 00:05:05,296
华生医生和我一样 热衷于稀奇古怪的东西
Dr. Watson shares my love of all that is bizarre,

11
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:08,152
而不是日常生活中那些稀松平常的老套故事
but outside the routine of everyday existence.

12
00:05:09,154 --> 00:05:11,476
现在还不能断定
It is at present and impossible to say

13
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:13,657
这个案子是否属于犯罪案件
that this case is an instance of crime or no.

14
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,053
但是足以说
But suffice it to say that I know as little

15
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:18,138
对于杰贝斯・威尔逊先生 我和你知道的一样少
about Mr. Jay Beards Wilson as you do yourself,

16
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,994
除了一些明显的事实外
beyond the obvious facts.

17
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,122
他干过一阵儿体力活
That he has done manual labor at sometime.

18
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:25,645
曾经去过中国
But it takes staff that he has been to China.

19
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,280
他最近还...
And that he has done

20
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,010
写过不少东西
a considerable amount of writing lately.

21
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,877
噢!我的老天爷!
How in the name of good fortune

22
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:33,409
您怎么知道的?福尔摩斯先生
did you know all that Mr. Holmes?

23
00:05:33,776 --> 00:05:36,277
真像福音一样确切 我是干过体力活
As true as gospel I once did manual labor.

24
00:05:36,477 --> 00:05:38,866
我曾在船上做过木匠
I started off as a ship's carpenter.

25
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,209
你的手 我的好仆人
Your hands my good servant.

26
00:05:40,397 --> 00:05:41,492
你右手的肌肉
The muscles of your right hand

27
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:42,904
比左手的发达
are more developed than the left.

28
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,866
那写作呢?
And the writing?

29
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,170
还有别的什么更能说明问题吗?
What else could be indicated.

30
00:05:47,462 --> 00:05:49,702
右手袖子足有五寸长的地方 磨得油光发亮
By the right cuffs are very shiny for five inches.

31
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:54,342
左胳膊肘那儿打了个整洁的补丁
And the left sleeve with smooth pattern over the elbow

32
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,875
这是经常贴在桌面所致... 但中国?
where you lean it on the desk... but China?

33
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,513
右手腕正上方的鱼状纹身
The fish tattooed immediately above his right wrist.

34
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:04,824
我对纹身略有研究 威尔逊先生
I have made a small study of tattoo marks,Mr. Wilson, 

35
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,663
我还写过...
and have even contributed to the

36
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:08,189
这方面的文章
 literature of the subject.

37
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,499
染鱼鳞的绝技
That trick of staining the fish scales,

38
00:06:10,812 --> 00:06:12,802
使用淡淡的粉红色 是中国才有的
a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China.

39
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:15,001
还有 我看见一枚中国钱币
Wherein addition I see a Chinese coin hanging

40
00:06:15,232 --> 00:06:16,409
垂在他的表链上
from his watch chain.

41
00:06:16,764 --> 00:06:18,222
这岂不是显然易见的吗
The matter becomes even more simple.

42
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,005
哈哈 真没想到...
Well I never...

43
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,080
起初我还觉得你真是神机妙算
I thought at first it was something clever,

44
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,092
说穿了 也没什么了不起
but now I see there's nothing in it after all.

45
00:06:29,607 --> 00:06:31,826
我开始觉得要是心眼太实
You know I begin to think that my reputation

46
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,380
会毁了自己的名声
such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I'm so candid

47
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:37,758
"不为人知者乃为壮丽"
omne ignotum pro magnifico.

48
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:42,803
解释之后 一切都变得平庸
Everything becomes commonplace by explanation.

49
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,596
华生 这么翻译太不严谨了
Watson that is a very loose translation.

50
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:48,171
哦 请把那则广告给医生看
Oh, please show the doctor that advertisement.

51
00:06:48,517 --> 00:06:51,205
哦 在这儿 您自己看吧 先生
Oh, there, you can read it for yourself sir.

00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:55,990
红发会
To the Red Headed League.

53
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:00,429
由于原住于美国宾夕法尼亚州的
On account of the request

54
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,327
黎巴嫩人

薪金为每周四镑
which entitles a member of the league to a salary

57
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,741
工作则实系挂名而已
of four pounds a week for purely nominal services.

58
00:07:13,815 --> 00:07:17,171
凡红发男性 身体健康 智力健全
All red headed men sound in body and mind

59

62
00:07:28,794 --> 00:07:31,097
红发会办公室邓肯・罗斯处提出申请
7 Copes Court Fleet Street.

63
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:32,556
此事当真?
Is this serious?

64
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:36,934
这则广告有点不合常理 华生
It is a little off the beaten track, hey Watson.

65
00:07:37,196 --> 00:07:40,760
麻烦你记下报纸名和日期
Oh, would you make a note of the paper and the date?

66
00:07:42,054 --> 00:07:44,815
<纪事年报> 4月27日 星期六
Evening standard of Saturday the 27th of April,

67
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:46,442
两个月前
two months ago.

68
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:47,660
请坐下
Do try this sitting.

69
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:51,299
现在 威尔逊先生 请说吧
Now, Mr. Wilson, off you go

70
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:53,717
简略地介绍一下你自己
at scratch and tell us all about yourself.

71
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:58,909
嗯 先生们 我开了个
Oh, well gentlemen I have a small

72
00:07:59,087 --> 00:08:01,775
小当铺 在萨克斯科伯格广场
pawn broking business in Sax Coburg Street,

73
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:03,026
在市区附近
near the city.

74
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,995
买卖做得不大
It's not a very large affair.

75
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,695
只能勉强维持生计
It just gives me a living.

76
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:11,314
过去我还能请两个伙计 但现在只雇得起一个
I used to keep two assistants but now I just keep the one.

77
00:08:11,554 --> 00:08:15,723
实话实说 我原打算付全部工钱
And to tell you the truth I'd have a job to make you pay

78
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,339
但这个伙计 自愿拿一半工资
but the deeds willing to come at half wages

79
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,205
说是为了学做生意
so as to learn the business.

80
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,238
大约两个月前...
About two months ago...

81
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,199
这个热心肠的小伙子叫什么?
What is the name of the obliging youth?

82
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:28,127
文森特・斯波尔丁
Vincent Spalding.

83
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:31,025
但他算不上是个小伙子 福尔摩斯先生
Oh, but he's not such a youth either Mr. Holmes.

84
00:08:31,213 --> 00:08:32,869
我不太清楚他的年纪
It's difficult to say his age

85
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:35,320
可我再也找不到比这个 更精明能干的伙计了
but I couldn't wish for a smarter assistant.

86
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,041
你的运气真不赖!
You seem most remarkably fortunate.

87
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:41,605
以低于市价的工钱雇到伙计
In having an employee who comes under the market price,

88
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,190
不知道你那个伙计
I don't know that your assistant

89
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,086
是不是同那则广告 一样非比寻常?
is not as remarkable as your advertisement.

90
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:47,506
哦 他也有缺点
Oh, but he does have his faults.

91
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,882
他比谁都爱照相
However, he was such a fellow for photography.

92
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:52,759
整天拿着相机到处拍照
Always snapping away with his camera

93
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,845
不愿在工作上动脑筋 然后钻进...
when he should be improving his mind and then diving down

94
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:58,346
地下室去冲洗那些东西
into the cellar to develop the wretched things.

95
00:08:58,598 --> 00:09:00,723
但是 总的来说 他算是个好伙计
Still on the whole he's a good worker.

96
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,255
没什么坏心眼
No vice in him.

97
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,945
当初就是他 把广告拿给我看的
It was he who first showed me the advertisement.

98
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,069
但愿我是红头发 威尔逊先生
I wish to the lord I was a red headed man Mr. Wilson.

99
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:21,905
为什么?
Why is that?

100
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,427
现在红发会里
Well there's another vacancy

101
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,834
又有职位空缺了
in the League of Red Headed Men.

102
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,243
从未听过这事儿
I've never heard of it.

103
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:34,438
我还纳闷呢 您本人就非常符合资格
Well, I'd wonder at that you being so eligible yourself.

104
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:37,562
薪金相当可观
Nice money too.

105
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:41,284
一年200镑 活儿又轻松...
A couple hundred a year and the work's light...

106
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,590
到时可得有成千上万的 红发人去应聘吧
Oh, there'll be thousands of red headed men apply.

107
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:50,654
我可不这么认为 先生
Oh, well I doubt that sir.

108
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:52,739
没人有你这么火红的头发...
Well nobody with such a fine fiery color

109
00:09:52,865 --> 00:09:54,208
如同上天恩赐一般 威尔逊先生
as you're blessed with Mr. Wilson.

110
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:59,389
但是我想还是不值得
But then I suppose it's only worth your while

111
00:09:59,704 --> 00:10:00,797
为了那几百英镑
to put yourself out of the way

112
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,944
特地跑一趟吧
for sake of a few hundred pounds.

113
00:10:04,123 --> 00:10:06,113
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

114
00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:13,056
嗯 我很爱呆在家里
Well I'm very much of a stay at home sort of person.

115
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:15,974
有时候连续几个星期 我都不会踏出门口半步
Sometimes weeks on end before I put my foot over the doormat

116
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:19,978
但这个看起来很有意思
but this it looked interesting.

117
00:10:20,906 --> 00:10:23,709
我对此很感兴趣 而年轻的文森特...
I was intrigued and young Vincent

118
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,271
说他愿意陪我一起去
said he'd come with me.

119
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:28,691
所以星期一早上 我们锁好店门
So, on Monday morning we shut up the shop

120
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:31,684
便动身了
and off we went.

121
00:10:34,656 --> 00:10:35,916
文森特 我们回去吧
Now, Vincent let's go back

122
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,155
人太多 过不去
I can't get by the crowd.

123
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,187
拿出勇气 威尔逊先生
Courage Mr. Wilson.

124
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:40,543
我们就快到了 正处在重要关头
We're so near and so much at stake.

125
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:42,639
现在穿上外套
Now you put your coat on

126
00:10:43,297 --> 00:10:44,338
跟着我走
and come along with me.

127
00:11:01,403 --> 00:11:03,841
喂 喂 喂 请小点声
Ohy, Ohy, Ohy, a little less noise

128
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,217
先生们
please gentlemen.

129
00:11:06,688 --> 00:11:10,784
这里 看这里 你什么意思?
Here, here what's your game?

130
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,837
喂 滚开
Hey get out of here.

131
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,150
喂...喂...
Hey, hey...

132
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,658
你可以走了 你是下一个 进去吧
Off you go, you next, get in.

133
00:11:29,892 --> 00:11:31,235
嘿 你往哪儿走?
Hey, where are you going?

134
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,768
这边直走 走吧
Straight this way, Come on.

135
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,737
这位是威尔逊先生
This is Mr. Wilson.

136
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:35,926
直接进去吧 威尔逊先生
Right in you go Mr. Wilson.

137
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,219
非常合适
Admirably suited.

138
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,222
完全符合要求
Every requirement.

139
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,476
静下来了
Very quiet.

140
00:12:04,427 --> 00:12:06,917
恭喜您 威尔逊先生
Congratulations Mr. Wilson.

141
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,106
再迟疑就太不对了
It would be injustice to hesitate.

142
00:12:09,702 --> 00:12:12,641
您不介意我采取谨慎措施吧?
You will I'm sure excuse me if I take an obvious precaution.

143
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,415
眼泪都流出来了
Tears in your eyes.

144
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,551
想必是真头发了
I perceive all is as it should be.

145
00:12:21,648 --> 00:12:23,221
我们不得不小心防范
We have to be careful.

146
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:26,859
被假发骗过两次 被颜料骗过一次
Twice deceived by wigs, once by paint.

147
00:12:27,715 --> 00:12:29,882
还有用鞋蜡来玩花招的
I could tell you tales of cobblers wags

148
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:33,332
您听了准会感到恶心
that would disgust you with human nature.

149
00:12:35,907 --> 00:12:37,636
我叫邓肯・罗斯
My name is Duncan Ross.

150
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,399
我自己就是基金的受益人
I am myself a pension upon a fund left by

151
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:42,139
这是一位尊贵的捐赠者遗留的
a noble benefactor.

152
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:47,102
就知道你要问我 伊乔基亚・霍普金斯先生的事
I see you're about to question me about Mr. Ethic Guya Hopkins.

153
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:52,075
他自己长了一头红发
He was himself red headed.

154
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,357
他年轻时离开伦敦去了美国
In his youth he left London for America where he made

155
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,245
赚了好几百万美元

156
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,694
他死后 人们发现他曾立下遗嘱
On his death it was found that he had instructed

157
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:06,365
吩咐财产托管人让他出生的这座城市中
a trustee in his will to make life a little easier

158
00:13:06,534 --> 00:13:09,066
生活着的红发人日子过得舒适安逸
for the red headed men in the town of his birth.

159
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,371
绝妙的颜色
Wonderful color.

160
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:15,893
您的全名叫什么?  威尔逊先生
Now what's your full name Mr. Wilson?

161
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,864

163
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:23,771

164
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:24,981
你有妻儿吗?
Do you have a family?

165
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,047

No, I'm a widower.

166
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:28,881
不 我从来就没有过什么家人
No, I never had any family.

167
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:34,875
哎呀 真遗憾听您这么说
Oh dear, sad to hear you say that.

168
00:13:36,293 --> 00:13:37,855
本基金设立的目的就是为了...
The fund of course is for the propagation

169
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,378
红发人更多地繁衍
and spread of red headed men

170
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:41,610
延续他们的血脉
as well as with their maintenance.

171
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:47,300
要是换了别人 这个缺点可能是不幸的
In another case the objection might be fatal.

172
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,627
但我想我们得破例照顾一下
However, I've think we've got to stretch a point

173
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:54,609
因为您的头发长得这么好
in favor of a man with such a head of hair as yours.

174
00:14:04,054 --> 00:14:05,898
空缺已经有人了
The vacancy has been filled.

175
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,581

走吧
Off you go.

179
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:43,997
您什么时候可以来上班?
Now, when would you be free to start upon your new duties?

180
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:48,187
嗯 这事还有点不好办 因为我本身也有做买卖
Oh, well it is rather awkward as I do have a business already.

181
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:49,730
什么时候上班?
What would be the hours?

182
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,179
上午10点到下午2点

183
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,076

184
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:54,817

185
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,714

没错
Correct.

188
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:02,051
干些什么活?
And the work?

189
00:15:02,146 --> 00:15:03,333
纯属挂名
Purely nominal.

190
00:15:03,428 --> 00:15:04,970
纯属挂名是什么意思?
Yes, but what do you call purely nominal?

191
00:15:06,774 --> 00:15:08,962
就是说您必须待在办公室里
Well, you have to stay in the office

192
00:15:09,224 --> 00:15:11,214
至少在工作时间内呆在这栋楼里
or at least in the building the whole time.

193
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,800
一旦离开 便会 永远丢掉这个职位

195
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,353
噢 我不会离开的
Oh, I shouldn't dream of leaving.

196
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:18,907
任何借口都没用
No, excuse will avail.

197
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:20,668
不管是生病 有事  还是其他原因都不行
Not a sickness, business, anything else.

198
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,787
您必须待在这里 否则会丢掉这份工作
Here you will remain or else lose your ability.

199
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,465
哦 我清楚明白了
Oh, I am quite clear on that point.

200
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:29,560
具体的工作内容是什么呢?
But what exactly is the work?

201
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,700
您的工作是抄写<大英百科全书>
It is to copy out the encyclopedia Britannica.

202
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,681
这是第一卷

204
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:43,101
我们只提供桌椅
We will supply this desk and chair.

205
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:47,469
下星期一能开始上班吗?
Now would you be free to start next Monday morning?

206
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:50,356
是的 当然可以
Oh, yes, certainly.

207
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,057
那么再次祝贺您
Then once again my congratulations

208
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:58,435
杰贝斯・威尔逊先生 得到这个重要职务
Mr. Jay Beards Wilson on the most important position

209
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:00,530

214
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,309
这条路最近 先生
This is the quickest way out sir.

215
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:19,335
哦
Oh.

216
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:20,825
这边走
This way.

217
00:16:28,843 --> 00:16:30,572
我回到家仔细一想
When I got home the whole thing seemed

218
00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:33,376
整件事情太荒谬了
on reflection to be quite ridiculous.

219
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:34,929
为什么?
Why?

220
00:16:35,004 --> 00:16:36,691
谁会立下这样不寻常的遗嘱呢?
Who would make such an extraordinary will?

221
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:39,214
一个如此慷慨的百万富翁
Not a very generous millionaire to make you

222
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,767
竟让你自备笔墨纸砚
buy your own pen, ink, and paper.

223
00:16:41,873 --> 00:16:44,082
就是说嘛 福尔摩斯先生
Exactly Mr. Holmes.

224
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,554
很快我便说服自己 这一定是个大骗局
I soon persuaded myself it was some great hoax or fraud.

225
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:53,588
但到了星期一早上 又觉得只有笨蛋才会
And then when Monday morning came along it seemed stupid

226
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,455
拒绝这样的好工作
to turn down a good job

227
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,645
所以 我去买了一瓶 一个便士的墨水
so, off I went and bought a penny bottle of ink

228
00:16:59,771 --> 00:17:03,179
一只羽毛笔和七张大书写纸
and a pen and seven sheets of fools kept paper.

229
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,796
前往教皇院
And I set off for Popes Core.

230
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:27,081
早上好 威尔逊先生 欢迎您
Good morning, Mr. Wilson and welcome.

231
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,029
早上好
Good morning.

232
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:32,095
让我又惊又喜的是
Well to my surprise and delight

233
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:35,149
一切都很顺利
everything was as right as possible.

234
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,171
桌椅都摆好了
The table was set up ready for me

235
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:41,602
邓肯・罗斯先生也在那儿 等我了解工作内容后
and Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see I got fairly to work.

236
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:45,177
我的工作也就真正开始了
My employment had truly begun.

237
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:47,981
每天都是如此
The schedule never varied.

238
00:17:48,212 --> 00:17:51,755
从早上10点开始干活 下午2点离开
My work started at 10:00 and ended at 2:00

239
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:55,132
12点半的时候有一小段时间吃午餐
with a small break for my lunch at half past 12:00.

240
00:17:56,665 --> 00:18:00,260
每星期六下午2点 罗斯先生都会过来
Every Saturday at 2:00 Mr. Ross would come in

241
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,637
发给我一个星期的薪水
and give me my money.

242
00:18:02,784 --> 00:18:04,680
称赞我抄写得真不赖
Compliment me upon the amount that I'd written

243
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,462
然后我们一起离开
and then we'd both leave.

244
00:18:06,704 --> 00:18:09,278
最后罗斯先生把门锁上
Mr. Ross locking the door afterwards.

245
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:12,196
我发现朝鲜蓟非常迷人
The artichokes I found were positively fascinating.

246
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,552
他们也开花
They have a kind of a bloom on them but...

247
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:18,513
我觉得很有趣...
I thought that was very interesting...

248
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:21,577
再回
Good Morning.

249
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:32,440

整件事情突然结束了

我像往常一样去上班 发现门关着 锁了

正好相反 您倒赚不少钱

更不用说您长了见识

瘦高个子
Oh, well he's tall, slightly built

我想过晚餐的时候歇业休息
Well I had thought of shutting up shop

328
00:23:05,957 --> 00:23:08,155
因为文森特建议我
at dinner time today because Vincent had suggested

329

去巴金与我妹妹
I spend the rest of the weekend

整件事令我 精神极度紧张

华生 你怎么看?
What do you make of it all Watson?

340
00:23:46,371 --> 00:23:47,641
我什么也没看出来
I make nothing of it.

341
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,581
这事儿太玄乎了
Most mysterious business.

342
00:23:50,874 --> 00:23:52,551
但是还有更大的阴谋

343
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,721
隐藏在这件事情背后
hanging from this affair then that first had appeared.

What are you going to do?

抽烟
To smoke.

346
00:24:08,053 --> 00:24:10,283
得抽三斗烟的时间才能解决
It is quite a three pipe problem

347
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:13,816
50分钟内请不要和我搭话
and I beg that you won't speak to me for 50 minutes.

348
00:24:38,908 --> 00:24:40,992
红发会事件
The business of the Red Headed League

349
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,357
已经结束了 先生
is concluded sir.

350

353
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,222
来 华生
Come Watson.

354
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,359
啊?
Huh?

355
00:25:44,632 --> 00:25:46,340
劳驾
Excuse me.

356
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,685
请问从这儿到河滨大街怎么走?
Can you tell me the way to the Strand from here?

00:25:49,739 --> 00:25:52,563
在第三个路口右拐 到第四个路口左拐 先生
Uh, third right, fourth left sir.

358
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:54,480
谢谢
Thank you.

359
00:25:58,276 --> 00:25:59,056
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

360
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:01,038
福尔摩斯 我都可以告诉你
Holmes, I could have told you that.

361
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,331
毫无疑问 华生
No doubt, Watson.

362
00:26:03,801 --> 00:26:04,873
怎么了?
What is it?

363
00:26:07,002 --> 00:26:09,784
你为何用手杖敲人行道?
And why did you beat the pavement with your stick?

364
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,088
华生 我们在敌人的领地侦察
Watson we are spies in an enemy's territory.

365
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:44,005
这是我的爱好
It's a hobby of mine

366
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:46,007
熟悉伦敦每一次细微的地方
to have an exact knowledge of London.

367
00:26:46,165 --> 00:26:48,707
这里有一家莫蒂麦烟草店
Now there's Mortimore's, the tobacconist.

368
00:26:49,312 --> 00:26:50,927
一个小售报摊
The little newspaper shop.

369
00:26:51,564 --> 00:26:53,272
城市和郊区银行的科伯格分行
Coburg Branch, the City and Suburban Bank.

370
00:26:53,576 --> 00:26:55,931
麦克法兰马车制造厂

371
00:26:56,411 --> 00:26:58,244
转角处有一家素食店
and the vegetarian restaurant around the corner.

372
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:01,830
华生 想想刚才的情景 我们有可能
Watson commit to memory, it's just possible

373
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,468
正被人监视着
that we're being observed.

374
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,324
一个大罪案即将发生
A considerable crime's in contemplation.

375
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:25,514
今天是星期六 在某程度上使事情更为复杂
Today being Saturday somewhat complicates matters.

376
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:31,466
但是现在 医生... 工作已经完成
But now doctor... our work is done.

377
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:33,333
是时候消遣了
It is time we had some play.

378
00:27:33,583 --> 00:27:36,000
萨拉萨蒂(西班牙小提琴家)下午在 圣詹姆斯会堂表演
Sarasate's playing at Sir James Hall this afternoon.

379
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:38,565
先来份三明治和一杯咖啡?
A sandwich and a cup of coffee?

380
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:40,504
然后去小提琴演奏厅
And then off to violin land with all

381
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,151
感受美妙而优雅的气氛
its sweetness, delicacy and harmony.

382
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:47,895
没有红头发委托人 出难题困扰我们
And no red headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.

383
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:14,767
他整个下午都坐在观众席
All the afternoon he sat in the stalls

384
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:18,177
沉醉在欢乐的意境中
wrapped in the most perfect happiness

385
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:23,982
他满脸的微笑 迷离的眼神
while his gently smiling face, and his languid dreamy eyes

386
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,182
和做大侦探时的福尔摩斯
were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth hound

387
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,685
神态迥异 判若两人
as it was possible to conceive.

388
00:28:34,523 --> 00:28:37,670
看着他完全融入音乐当中
When I saw him so enwrapped in music

389
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:42,069
我觉得一个邪恶的时刻可能即将来临
I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those

390
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:45,196
而他会追查到底
he had set himself to hunt down.

391
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,868
精彩绝伦 华生
Excellent Watson.

392
00:29:37,994 --> 00:29:39,598
你有做制图师的才华
You have a future as a cartographer.

393
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:41,840
那是阿瑟尔尼・琼斯侦探
That will be Athelney Jones.

394
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,351
我认为有苏格兰场的人
I thought it was well enough to have someone

395
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,684
与我们同往比较好
from Scotland Yard with us.

396
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:46,927
他在侦探这个行业 算是个低能儿
He's an absolute imbecile at his profession

397
00:29:47,063 --> 00:29:49,897
但抓人的时候顽强得像只大龙虾
but he does the tenacity of a lobster when he gets

398
00:29:50,002 --> 00:29:51,512
一遇到罪犯就紧抓不放
his claws into someone.

399
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,983
晚上好 琼斯
Good evening Jones.

400
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:55,862
我们又成为搭档了 福尔摩斯先生
So we're working in couples again,Mr. Holmes.

401
00:29:56,591 --> 00:29:58,967
我们这位朋友是个追猎高手
Our friend is a wonderful man for starting a chase.

402
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:01,667
他所需的仅是一条 帮他捕获猎物的老狗
All he needs is an old dog to help him do the running down.

403
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:04,136
梅里韦瑟先生 我的朋友和同事华生医生
Mr. Merryweather, my friend and college Dr. Watson.

404
00:30:04,545 --> 00:30:05,701
你好 先生
How do you do sir?

405
00:30:06,316 --> 00:30:08,202
我只希望我们的追捕
I only hope a wild goose may not prove

406
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:09,452
不要徒劳无功
to be the end of our chase.

407
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:11,371
就我个人而言 并不看好
I'm not personally in favor

408
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,174
业余犯罪调查
of amateur criminal investigation.

409
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,519
你应该对福尔摩斯先生充满信心
You might place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes.

410
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:17,959
既然您这么说 琼斯先生
Oh, if you say so Mr. Jones.

411
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:20,575
他自有一套办法 要是他不介意...
He has his own little methods, which if he won't

412
00:30:20,723 --> 00:30:22,192
我这么说 有点过于理论化
mind me saying so a little theoretical

413
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,546
和妙想天开 但他倒是具有...
and fantastic, but he has the makings

414
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,766
...侦探的素质
of a detective in him.

415
00:30:26,456 --> 00:30:29,019
但我还是要说 正如我说过的
But I do say as I've said before

416
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:31,010
科伯格分行非常安全
the Colburg Branch of the Bank is as well secured

417
00:30:31,199 --> 00:30:32,271
如伦敦任一座楼房一样
as any building in London.

418
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:34,658
它是不可能被破门而入的
There isn't a possibility that it could be broken into.

419
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:37,515
连保险公司顾问都这样说
Even insurance assessors agree on that point.

420
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:39,046
而先生 你应该知道
And you sir should know

421
00:30:39,142 --> 00:30:41,194
作为银行经理和董事
being not only the resident manager but also the director.

422
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,769
我应该知道 并且确实知道
I should know and I do know.

423
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,499
还有 这可是我27年来
And what is more, this is the first time

424
00:30:45,656 --> 00:30:47,312
头一次错过
for seven and twenty years that I've missed my

425
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,012
俱乐部的周六威士忌之夜
Saturday night of whiskey at my club.

426
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,608
对我造成很大的不便啊
And I find myself extremely inconvenienced.

427
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:54,672
我想你会发现 今晚的行动
I think that you will find the game tonight

428
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:58,989
更加刺激 赌注将会是
much more exciting and the stake will be

429
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,657
好几千英镑
for many, many thousands of pounds.

430
00:31:02,658 --> 00:31:04,763
我的奖赏是什么呢? 福尔摩斯先生
And what will be my reward be Mr. Homes?

431
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:08,600
一位年轻人 名叫克莱
A young man, called Clay.

432
00:31:09,152 --> 00:31:10,662
约翰・克莱？
John Clay?

433
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:13,081
噢 我真想抓住那个恶魔
Oh, how I'd like to get my hands on that devil.

434
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,738
你会的
You shall.

435
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,636
福尔摩斯先生所说这个年轻人是个绅士
This young fellow's a gentleman as Mr. Holmes says

436
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:18,293
但背叛了自己的阶层
but he's turned against his class.

437
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:20,211
如恶魔般狡诈
He's as cunning as the devil.

438
00:31:20,514 --> 00:31:22,639
如鳝鱼般圆滑 把杀人和诈骗
Slippery as an eel and he's turned crib cracking

439
00:31:22,756 --> 00:31:23,974
当作一门艺术
and forgery into a fine art.

440
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,716
其祖父是王室公爵
His grandfather was a royal duke

441
00:31:27,665 --> 00:31:31,176
他本人曾在伊顿公学 和牛津大学念过书
and he himself was educated at Eaton and Oxford.

442
00:31:31,178 --> 00:31:34,398
所以 华生 带上枪
So Watson, bring the gun.

443
00:31:34,973 --> 00:31:37,484
走吧 先生们 马车就在楼下
Come gentlemen our cab is below.

444
00:33:20,704 --> 00:33:22,308
保险库的钥匙只有两把
There are only two keys to the vault.

445
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:28,000
我有一把 行长有一把
I have one, the chairman holds the other

446
00:33:28,154 --> 00:33:29,386
放在他的私人保险柜里
in his personal safe.

447
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:40,519
从上面攻进来相当困难
Well you are certainly not vulnerable from above.

448
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,696
从下面来也是
Nor from below.

449
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,688
稍等一下
Just a minute.

450
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:46,461
请您小声一点
I'm going to ask you to be a little more quiet please.

451
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:11,363
请您找个箱子坐下
Might I get you to sit on one of those boxes

452
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:13,041
别乱动
and not to interfere?

453
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:35,713
根本不可能有小偷
There is no way in which a thief

454
00:34:35,945 --> 00:34:37,299
能够强行闯入银行
could break into this bank.

455
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:53,769
有什么特殊原因使得小偷
Is there a special reason why a thief

456
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,425
想要强行闯入这个银行吗?
should want to break into this bank?

457
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,543
没什么特别的...
Nothing particularly...

458
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:02,013
过去几个月进来的东西呢?
Something in the past few months?

459
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:05,516
你想对我们隐藏的事?
Something that you had concealed from us?

460
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,820
这是机密信息
The information I have is confidential

461
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,665
只有银行董事才知道
known only to the directors of the bank.

462
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:13,073
不能把它泄露给公众
It is not to be divulged to members of the public,

463
00:35:14,461 --> 00:35:16,711
业余侦探也不行
not even amateur detectives.

464
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,611
是私人顾问侦探 梅里韦瑟先生
Private consulting detective, Mr. Merryweather.

465
00:35:22,268 --> 00:35:24,310
在打击犯罪上独一无二
Unique in the annuls of crime I believe,

466
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,812
难道不是吗 警官?
isn't that so inspector?

467
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,000
是的 医生
Yes, doctor.

468
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:28,929
我建议你与福尔摩斯先生合作
I advise you to cooperate with Mr. Holmes.

469
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:34,703
尤其在这个时候 我正想法设法帮你
Especially as at this moment I am trying to save your skin

470
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,080
和其他董事度过危机
and that of your fellow directors.

471
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,291
那么到底是什么?
So what is it?

472
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:43,522
我们的法国黄金
Our French gold.

473
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,941
几个月前我们恰好有机会增加资金来源
We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources

474
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:50,111
从法兰西银行
and borrowed for that purpose 60,000 Napoleons

475
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:51,216
借了6万拿破仑金币(一块拿破仑金币值20法郎)
from the bank of France.

476
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:55,822
所以我们的黄金储备就比
Therefore our reserve of bullion is much larger than is usual

477
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,387
其他分行多很多
in such a branch of the bank.

478
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,421
这些金币在哪?
Where is this gold?

479
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:07,956
华生医生坐的那些大箱子里
The crates upon which Dr. Watson sits

480
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:11,187
装着3万拿破仑金币
contain 30,000 Napoleons

481
00:36:11,762 --> 00:36:13,522
用铅箔一层一层包着
wrapped between layers of lead foil.

482
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:20,111
我们可以看看吗?
May we see it?

483
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:26,628
这比我当初所想
This is much bolder and larger in conception

484
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,599
更大胆 更大规模 难道不是吗 琼斯?
than I had first thought, wouldn't you say Jones?

485
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:31,161
确实是的
I would indeed.

486
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,038
这位克莱更像个业余探险家
This Clay's more of an amateur adventurer

487
00:38:33,248 --> 00:38:34,602
或是冲动型罪犯
or spur of the moment criminal,

488
00:38:34,748 --> 00:38:37,666
长期计划不是克莱的风格 一点都不是
Long planning is not Clay's type at all sir, not at all.

489
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:42,733
除非他是别人手中的棋子
Unless he's a pawn in a much larger game.

490
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,100
梅里韦瑟先生 有人探知...
Mr. Merryweather someone has had access to

491
00:38:47,226 --> 00:38:49,602
你最机密的信息
information of the most confidential sort.

492
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,969
制定了周密详尽的计划
Careful plans have been made.

493
00:38:56,024 --> 00:38:58,483
这是经人精心筹划的
A mastermind has been at work.

494
00:39:01,393 --> 00:39:02,935
你是说...
Are you suggesting that...

495
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:06,593
我是说这非常像
I am suggesting that it bears the hallmarks

496
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,396
莫里亚蒂教授的手段
of Professor Moriarity's work.

497
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,348
莫里亚蒂?
Moriarity?

498
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,923
莫里亚蒂是谁?
And who is this Moriarity?

499
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:19,759
我们并不清楚 先生
We don't really know sir.

500
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:21,561
我和警方都不曾想到
That is neither the police nor I think

501
00:39:21,698 --> 00:39:23,594
夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生已经在盯着他
Mr. Sherlock Holmes here has ever set eyes on him.

502
00:39:24,169 --> 00:39:26,659
他的名字在黑社会人所皆知
His name echoes and re-echoes throughout the underworld.

503
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,463
显然他出身高贵
It appears that he's a man of good birth,

504
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:37,782
受过极好的教育 但是他继承了...
an excellent education but he has hereditary

505
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,971
恶魔般的特质
tendencies of the most diabolical kind.

506
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,068
血液里充斥着犯罪的因子
A criminal strain runs in his blood

507
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:49,290
日趋严重 变得相当危险
which has increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous

508
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:51,468
因为他的智力 非比寻常
by his extraordinary mental powers.

509
00:39:52,731 --> 00:39:57,890
他组织了这座城市中
He's the organizer of half that is evil and nearly all that

510
00:39:58,068 --> 00:40:00,923
半数罪案和几乎所有未被识破的案件
is undetected in this great city.

511
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,593
却一直逍遥法外
He is never caught.

512
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,137
他有手下被抓 但作为中坚力量的他...
His agent is caught but the central power

513
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:14,267
一直逍遥法外 甚至没有被怀疑过
is never caught certainly even suspected.

514
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,009
教授今晚是不会出现了
We shall not see the professor tonight.

515
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:30,371
今晚的敌人的唯一退路是...
The only way for tonight's enemy to escape is through

516
00:40:30,476 --> 00:40:31,799
经由当铺逃窜
the pawn brokers.

517
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:33,592
已经有一个警官守在门口了
There's already an inspector at the doors.

518
00:40:37,471 --> 00:40:39,158
没错
Exactly.

519
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:43,547
时间差不多到了... 各就各位...
We have only a few moments... positions...

520
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:52,491
能麻烦你把灯关掉吗?
Would you be so kind as to put out this lamp.

521
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,367
然后坐在黑暗中?
And sit in the dark?

522
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,348
恐怕是的
I'm afraid so.

523
00:40:57,453 --> 00:40:58,817
我们不能冒险发出亮光
We cannot risk the presence of light.

524
00:41:09,024 --> 00:41:12,004
一旦我亮出灯光 动作迅速...
When I shine the light, act swiftly...

525
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,266
要是他们肆无忌惮的开枪
If they fire have no compassion

526
00:41:14,497 --> 00:41:15,715
马上击毙他们
about shooting them down.

527
00:43:23,254 --> 00:43:24,409
噢 天哪!
Great god.

528
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:25,296
快逃 快
Jump at it, jump.

529
00:43:39,245 --> 00:43:41,058
没用的 约翰・克莱
It's no good jump John Clay.

530
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:43,392
你逃不掉了
You have no chance at all.

531
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:53,702
明白了...
So I see...

532
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,454
但我的同伴会没事
though I fancy my pal's all right.

533
00:43:58,310 --> 00:43:59,883
现在他正跑向...
At this moment he is running into

534
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:01,499
警察的环抱中
the welcoming arms of the police.

535
00:44:03,731 --> 00:44:05,794
你做得还真是天衣无缝
You seem to have done the thing very completely.

536
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:07,222
我该称赞你才对
I must compliment you.

537
00:44:07,317 --> 00:44:08,608
你也一样
And I you.

538
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:11,161
我是夏洛克・福尔摩斯 私人侦探
I'm Sherlock Holmes, a private investigator.

539
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:14,216
我从没怀疑过你是...
I didn't for a moment suspect your being

540
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,311
警察 福尔摩斯先生
a policeman Mr. Holmes.

541
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:19,304
得了吧 回去再聊
Come on, hold that one off for the Darby's.

542
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,970
别用你那脏手碰我
I beg you to take your filthy hands off me.

543
00:44:22,223 --> 00:44:24,411
你们不知道我的血管里流着皇家血统吗
You may not be aware that I have royal blood

544
00:44:24,517 --> 00:44:28,248
请你们跟我说话的时候
in my veins and be so kind as to say "sir" and "please"

545
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:29,675
都要用"先生"和"请"
when you address me.

546
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:30,801
那好
All right.

547
00:44:30,854 --> 00:44:32,927
请先生上台阶吧
Would you please sir, mind marching upstairs

548
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:35,252
我们会用马车将阁下
while we get a cab to transport your highness

549
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:36,701
送到警署
to the police station?

550
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,098
这还差不多
That's better.

551
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:47,563
先生们
Gentlemen.

552
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,037
噢 有个问题 克莱先生
Oh, one question Mr. Clay.

553
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:58,519
莫里亚蒂教授是否...
Am I right in thinking that professor Moriarity

554
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,989
策划了红发会事件?
was somewhere behind the idea of the Red Headed League?

555
00:45:05,503 --> 00:45:07,774
我建议你再也不要提起 这个名字 福尔摩斯先生
I suggest you keep that name off your lips Mr. Holmes

556
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:10,621
要是你还想将来活得好好的话
if you value your future well-being.

557
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,720
真的 先生们 我都不知道说什么好了
Really gentlemen, I don't know what to say.

558
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,221
请原谅我 福尔摩斯先生 我竟怀疑过
Please forgive me Mr. Holmes for ever doubting

559
00:45:20,379 --> 00:45:23,026
你的神机妙算 经天纬地之才
your outstanding, your brilliant qualities.

560
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,777
毫无疑问 你用最完美的方式
There is no doubt you've detected and defeated

561
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:27,425
侦查并破获了这起严谨周密的案件
in the most complete manner one of the boldest attempts

562
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:30,280
银行盗窃案 真是闻所未闻
at bank robbery that has ever come within my experience.

563
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:32,877
梅里韦瑟先生 这件事情上我有点破费
Mr. Merryweather I have then some small expense over this matter

564
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,826
希望银行能给予补偿
I shall expect the bank to refund.

565
00:45:37,808 --> 00:45:39,714
当然 当然
Of course, of course.

566
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,891
你不会是早知道...
It won't do you know...

567
00:46:40,238 --> 00:46:42,374
这样行不通吧
it won't do.

568
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:44,395
不 教授
No Professor.

569
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,804
抱歉 我们令您失望了
I'm sorry we failed you.

570
00:46:50,109 --> 00:46:51,286
夏洛克・福尔摩斯...
Sherlock Holmes...

571
00:46:51,464 --> 00:46:55,258
福尔摩斯在侦探这行只是个外行
Holmes is a mere amateur in the field of detection.

572
00:46:57,968 --> 00:47:04,117
但他看起来是个聪明人 或是运气不错
Still he seems a clever man or a lucky one

573
00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:10,101
还有碍我事的本领
and he has a positive talent for getting in my way.

574
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:13,301
要除掉他吗?
Should he be removed?

575
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:16,407
可能有这个必要
It may be necessary.

576
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:19,493
但会令人失望
It would be disappointing.

577
00:47:20,891 --> 00:47:22,870
我觉得他很有意思
I find him interesting.

578
00:47:23,914 --> 00:47:26,363
我相信这是他第三次
I believe this is the third time

579
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:28,061
给我添麻烦了
he has incommoded me.

580
00:47:30,044 --> 00:47:31,784
如果再继续下去 那么当然要...
If this continues then certainly something

581
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:33,919
做点什么来刺激一下福尔摩斯先生
will have to be done to encourage Mr. Holmes

582
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:39,351
让他要么离开 要么靠边站
either to withdraw or stand clear.

583
00:47:51,778 --> 00:47:54,174
谢谢
Thank you.

584
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,110
早上好 治安官
Morning Constable.

585
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:22,965
请原谅 华生医生
Beg your pardon Dr. Watson

586
00:48:23,946 --> 00:48:25,477
但这一切太让人难以承受了
but this has all been too much for me.

587
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,813
顾客都敬重我 因我值得信赖
My clients respect me as a man of confidence

588
00:48:28,991 --> 00:48:30,887
但我现在还有什么自信!
but where's the confidence left here.

589
00:48:31,128 --> 00:48:32,148
我全毁了...
I'm utterly ruined...

590
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,463
噢 开心点 威尔逊先生
Oh, cheer up Mr. Wilson.

591
00:48:34,651 --> 00:48:36,474
等清理完残局后 会感觉好点的
You'll feel better when you've cleared up the mess.

592
00:48:36,757 --> 00:48:38,027
你说的是很对...
Well that's all very well...

593
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,269
福尔摩斯先生 让我把这个给您
And Mr. Holmes asked me to give you this,

594
00:48:41,792 --> 00:48:44,918
50块金币 (价值75英镑)
50 sovereigns with the compliments

595
00:48:45,294 --> 00:48:46,669
城市和郊区银行敬赠
of the City and Suburban Bank.

596
00:48:46,764 --> 00:48:48,618
嗯 太好了
Well that's fair enough.

597
00:48:48,766 --> 00:48:52,111
噢 华生医生 这比我的期望好太多了
Oh, Dr. Watson, this is more than acceptable,

598
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:55,373
请代我问候夏洛克・福尔摩斯先生
and my compliments to Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

599
00:48:55,875 --> 00:48:57,927
他也向你致意 威尔逊先生
And he sends the same to you Mr. Wilson

600
00:48:58,074 --> 00:48:59,282
一点忠告...
and a word of advice...

601
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,450
下次你雇用伙计时
Next time you engage an assistant

602
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,661
付他适当的薪水
pay him the proper wage.

603
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:05,766
再见
Good day to you.

604
00:49:24,135 --> 00:49:29,221
噢 福尔摩斯 我确信自己
Oh, Holmes, I trust I am not more dense

605
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:31,420
并不比别人笨拙 可我看到...
than my neighbors and yet here I have seen

606
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:33,577
你所看到的 听到你所听到的
what you have seen, heard what you have heard

607
00:49:33,652 --> 00:49:35,777
然而你不仅对已经发生的事情了如指掌
and yet you have seen clearly not only what had happened,

608
00:49:36,174 --> 00:49:38,894
而且还知道将要发生什么 可我仍然觉得自己
but what was about to happen while to me the whole business

609
00:49:39,072 --> 00:49:41,229
一头雾水 不知道发生什么事
was still confused and grotesque.

610
00:49:41,324 --> 00:49:42,730
华生医生 回想一下
Dr. Watson recollect,

611
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:47,316
当我听到那个伙计只要求一半薪水时
when I heard that the assistant had come for half wages,

612
00:49:48,704 --> 00:49:50,631
很明显他带着某种目的
it was obvious that he had some motive

613
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:52,299
为确保事情在他掌控之中
for securing the situation.

614
00:49:52,842 --> 00:49:54,884
可你如何猜透他的动机?
Yes, but how did you know what his motive was?

615
00:49:55,344 --> 00:49:56,802
倘若那个当铺有女人
Had there been a woman in the house I would have

616
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:59,169
我会怀疑不过是些庸俗的风流事
suspected immediately if some vulgar intrigue,

617
00:49:59,294 --> 00:50:01,440
但当我听到威尔逊先生说起
but when I heard from Mr. Wilson

618
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:04,057
硫酸烧伤的疤和打过耳洞的耳朵
about the acid stain and the pierced ears

619
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:07,445
我就知道文森特・斯波尔丁和约翰・克莱
I knew that Vincent Spalding and John Clay

620
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,540
是同一个人
were the same person.

621
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:10,031
克莱为什么在那里呢？
But why was Clay there?

622
00:50:11,793 --> 00:50:13,335
照相就是线索所在
The photography gave you the clue.

623
00:50:13,638 --> 00:50:14,877
是的
Exactly.

624
00:50:14,962 --> 00:50:17,619
地下室 他在地下室做着某种勾当
The cellar, he was working on something in the cellar.

625
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:20,423
每天都干好几个小时
Something which took many hours a day

626
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:24,760
整整两个月 肯定是在挖地道 但通向哪里呢？
for two months on end. He was tunneling but where to?

627
00:50:26,751 --> 00:50:28,970
那天我用手杖敲打人行道时
When I tapped my stick on the pavement

628
00:50:29,253 --> 00:50:31,545
不过想弄清楚
in the street that day I was ascertaining

629
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:35,017
结果那条地道是从前面通向房子后面
whether the tunnel stretched in front or behind the building.

630
00:50:35,351 --> 00:50:38,529
它在前边 是朝后延伸的
It was in front, towards the back.

631
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:41,145
从这儿到河滨大街怎么走?
Could you tell me the way to the strand from here?

632
00:50:43,076 --> 00:50:45,274
我立即便认出是克莱 并拖延了他的时间
I recognized Clay immediately and delayed him

633
00:50:45,598 --> 00:50:48,370
仔细观察了他的膝盖
to have time to examine his knees.

634
00:50:49,715 --> 00:50:52,257
显然他花了很多时间挖隧道
There he spoke clearly of many hours or tunneling.

635
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:55,041
毫无疑问连通了错综复杂的下水道
No doubt linking up with a maze of sewers

636
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:56,459
就在萨克斯科伯格广场下面
beneath Saxe Coburg Square.

637
00:50:57,106 --> 00:50:58,981
他们关闭红发会办公室时
When they closed the Red Headed League offices,

638
00:50:59,118 --> 00:51:00,868
就标志着他们不再在意
it was a sign they no longer cared about

639
00:51:00,911 --> 00:51:02,661
杰贝斯・威尔逊是否在当铺里
Jay Beards Wilson's presence.

640
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:04,965
换句话说 地道已经挖通了
In other words the tunnel was complete.

641
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:07,467
他们会在星期六采取行动
And that they would make the attempt on a Saturday

642
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,800
只是猜测？
was just a guess?

643
00:51:09,991 --> 00:51:12,732
华生 你令我失望了
Watson, you disappoint me.

644
00:51:13,941 --> 00:51:15,451
我从不猜测
I never guess.

645
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,445
星期六晚上偷盗金块 是再好不过的
Saturday's an excellent night for stealing bullion.

646
00:51:19,904 --> 00:51:21,487
这样便有一整天时间逃跑
It gives you a full day to escape.

647
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:23,540
请拿好 慢走
Thank you then.

648
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,314
有劳
Thank you.

649
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:30,140
你的讲解真是精彩绝伦 福尔摩斯
Oh, you've reasoned it out beautifully Holmes.

650
00:51:30,181 --> 00:51:33,370
就像一根长长的链条 每一个环节都天衣无缝
It's so long a chain and yet every link rings true.

651
00:51:33,455 --> 00:51:34,861
这样我才不会无聊
It saved me from irony.

652
00:51:35,101 --> 00:51:38,332
有时我觉得我这一生
You know sometimes I think my whole life is spent

653
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:41,512
都在苦苦挣扎以摆脱
in one long effort to escape from

654
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:43,116
庸碌平凡
the common places of existence.

655
00:51:43,222 --> 00:51:44,044
不 不
No, no.

656
00:51:44,129 --> 00:51:47,099
您是个福泽人间的精英 福尔摩斯
You are a benefactor of the race Holmes.

657
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:50,821
哦 也许小有用处吧
Well maybe it is of some little use after all.

658
00:51:53,542 --> 00:51:57,025
人是渺小的 著作就是一切
"L'homme c'est rien...l'oeuvre c'est tout"

659
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,988
正如居斯塔夫・福楼拜写信给乔治・桑时所言
as Gusta Flabare wrote to George Sand.

660
