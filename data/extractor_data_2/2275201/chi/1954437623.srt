1
00:00:03,772 --> 00:00:05,832
天啊  我爱死这鸡肉了
Oh, my God. I love this chicken.

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:07,612
常言道  金肉  银肉
Oh, you know what they say,

3
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:09,852
比不上免费的鸡肉
best things in life are free.

4
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,702
是是是  我是吃了你不少东西
Okay, you're right. I eat your food a lot.

5
00:00:12,702 --> 00:00:13,242
不如这样吧
Now, how about this?

6
00:00:13,242 --> 00:00:15,362
我也让你随时去我冰箱找东西吃
You can raid my fridge anytime you want.

7
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:17,202
还真是"良心"发现啊
Oh, that's very kind of you.

8
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:20,412
等下次我想吃"汁多味美"的一号电池
Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D-cell battery

9
00:00:20,412 --> 00:00:22,312
再配一罐陈年腌瓜汁时
with a jar of old pickle juice,

10
00:00:22,312 --> 00:00:23,762
我会去找你的
I'll come a-knockin'.

11
00:00:24,732 --> 00:00:27,222
拉杰  你没有回复我的婚礼邀请函啊
Hey, Raj, you didn't send your RSVP in.

12
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,102
我得知道你是否会带女伴来
I'm suppose to ask you if you're bringing someone to the wedding.

13
00:00:30,162 --> 00:00:31,132
我再通知你
I'll let you know.

14
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:32,012
能快点吗
Well, can you make it soon?

15
00:00:32,012 --> 00:00:34,502
有人在打擂台要抢婚礼席位呢
There's a battle royale going on over the seating charts.

16
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:36,152
擂台一角有伯纳黛特的老妈
In one corner, Bernadette's mom,

17
00:00:36,152 --> 00:00:38,192
而另三角  是我老妈
in the other three, mine.

18
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:41,122
我最讨厌去婚宴了
Yeah, I hate wedding receptions.

19
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:44,052
真希望新郎新娘能学学比尔博・巴金斯
Yeah, I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins.

20
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:47,112
比尔博・巴金斯  《魔戒》人物  曾是至尊魔戒的持有者
戴上魔戒后  有隐身的功能

21
00:00:44,062 --> 00:00:47,112
戴上戒指  隐身  大家就各回各家
Slip on the ring, disappear, and everyone goes home.

22
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,612
你不是挺喜欢盖瑟教授的婚礼吗
Mm, you liked Professor Geyser's wedding.

23
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:53,142
他婚礼上有个圣代自助吧
They had a make-your-own-sundae bar.

24
00:00:53,142 --> 00:00:55,162
多么令人难忘的一夜啊
Oh, that was a night to remember.

25
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:58,482
告诉你  有次我从头到尾就只吃了碗坚果
Do you know, on one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts.

26
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:02,422
总而言之  你带不带人来都得赶紧通知我
Anyway, you got to let me know if you have a plus one.

27
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:04,712
你不带人的话  位子就让给那位
Because if not, my mom's trying to sneak in the doctor

28
00:01:04,712 --> 00:01:06,832
帮我妈脖子做抽脂的医生啦
who sucked the fat out of her neck.

29
00:01:11,032 --> 00:01:12,102
好吧  行
All right, uh, fine.

30
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:14,102
我会来  而且会携伴出席
I'm coming and I'm bringing somebody.

31
00:01:14,102 --> 00:01:15,782
库萨帕里  加个伴
Uh, Koothrappali plus one.

32
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:16,472
你带谁来啊
Who you bringing?

33
00:01:16,472 --> 00:01:17,832
你又带谁来啊
Who are you bringing?!

34
00:01:18,902 --> 00:01:20,872
他带我来啊  你带谁呢
He's bringing me; who are you bringing?

35
00:01:21,092 --> 00:01:24,192
哎哟  好一群多管闲事的美国佬啊
Wow, what a bunch of Nosey O'Donnells.

36
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,692
说嘛  带谁呢
Come on, who is it?

37
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:27,912
就是不说
I'm not telling.

38
00:01:27,912 --> 00:01:30,982
我是神秘的亚洲人  天机不可泄露
I'm from Asia, I'm mysterious, deal with it.

39
00:01:32,102 --> 00:01:35,222
霍华德  你会弄个圣代自助吧吗
Howard aren't having a make-your-own-sundae bar?

40
00:01:35,392 --> 00:01:36,782
应该不会吧
I don't think so.

41
00:01:36,882 --> 00:01:37,742
那我建议你弄一个
Well, you should.

42
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:39,982
五成的婚姻都是以离婚告终
50% of marriages end in divorce,

43
00:01:39,982 --> 00:01:43,432
但十成十的圣代自助吧都是以幸福收场
but 100% of make-your-own-sundae bars end in happiness.

44
00:01:44,822 --> 00:01:48,802

生活大爆炸  第五季第二十集

53
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:13,684
妈妈  爸爸  你们好吗
Hello, Mummy, Daddy. How are you?

54
00:02:13,684 --> 00:02:15,984
还行  没啥好抱怨的
Pretty good. Can't complain.

55
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:17,124
亲爱的  你肯定行
Oh, I'm sure you can.

56
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:18,644
酝酿一下  抱怨自然来
Just give it a minute.

57
00:02:20,234 --> 00:02:21,544
是这样的
Listen, uh,

58
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,494
我想告诉你们一件事
there's something I want to talk to you about.

59
00:02:23,494 --> 00:02:26,394
之前我一直没做好心理准备
I wasn't ready until now, but...

60
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:27,994
现在时机已到
I think it's time.

61
00:02:28,184 --> 00:02:29,294
终究还是发生了
It's finally happening.

62
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:31,594
你要出柜了  对吧
You're coming out of the closet, aren't you?

63
00:02:32,764 --> 00:02:35,784
我们爱你  也能接受你不同的生活方式
We love you, and we accept your alternate lifestyle.

64
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:38,434
你别...张扬乱搞就行了
Just... keep it to yourself.

65
00:02:39,654 --> 00:02:41,984
没有  我才不是同性恋
No, I'm not gay.

66
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,754
人家顶多是都市花美男
If anything, I'm metrosexual.

67
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,454
那是什么啊
What's that?

68
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:49,944
就是  我爱女人  也爱她们的保养品
It means I like women as well as their skin-care products.

69
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:51,704
好吧  如果你不是要出柜
Well, if you're not coming out,

70
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,684
在印度  板球是非常火热的运动

71
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:54,684
那干嘛还打扰我们看板球半决赛
why did you call us during the cricket semifinals?

72
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:58,034
在人海中寻觅真爱的日子  我过累了
I'm tired of trying to meet someone,

73
00:02:58,034 --> 00:03:01,384
我想请你们帮忙我找个...
and I think I'd like you to help me find a...

74
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:03,164
老婆
a wife.

75
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:05,354
我就问清楚
And just to clarify...

76
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:07,314
是女性的老婆吗
a female wife?

77
00:03:07,564 --> 00:03:09,014
是的
Yes!

78
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:12,384
包办婚姻  聪明的选择啊  儿子
Matchmaking-- very smart move, son.

79
00:03:12,394 --> 00:03:14,914
比自由恋爱的婚姻好多了
Much better than marrying for love.

80
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,244
我们当初就是自由恋爱的啊
We married for love.

81
00:03:22,884 --> 00:03:25,334
所以过得多么幸福美满啊
And it's been wonderful!

82
00:03:28,644 --> 00:03:31,124
量子力学真让我满心欢喜
Quantum physics makes me so happy.

83
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:33,734
恭喜恭喜
Yeah, I'm glad.

84
00:03:33,734 --> 00:03:35,914
如同看着一丝不挂的宇宙
It's like looking at the universe naked.

85
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:46,274
能打扰一下吗
Hi. Guys got a minute?

86
00:03:46,274 --> 00:03:47,604
行啊  什么事
Sure. What's up?

87
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,054
我想到谢尔顿开的小玩笑
Well, I was thinking about Sheldon's little joke

88
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,804
就那天晚上说我老蹭你们东西吃
the other night about me eating all your food.

89
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,144
那不是在开玩笑  不过...
Oh! That was no joke. But...

90
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:56,034
我能理解你以为我是说笑
I understand your confusion,

91
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,584
毕竟我一直是咱们小团体中的笑话王
as I am our group's resident cutup.

92
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:03,184
不是吧  你还是小团体中的笑话王吗
I'm sorry, you are our resident cutup?

93
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:04,884
当然
Yes.

94
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:07,544
证明一下
Oh, prove it.

95
00:04:07,654 --> 00:04:08,264
敲敲门  敲敲门
Knock-knock.

96
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:09,774
-谁呢  -插嘴物理学家
- Who's there? - Interrupting physicist.

97
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:13,034
这改编自插嘴牛的笑话
当对方问牛怎么插嘴  你就用牛叫声[哞Moo]插嘴

98
00:04:09,774 --> 00:04:13,034
-物理学家怎么插...   -介子[哞哞]
- Interrupting phys... - Muon!

99
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:18,524
言归正传  我收到了我广告的尾款
Anyway, I got a little residual check from my commercial,

100
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,224
我想了想  不如给你们
and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys

101
00:04:20,224 --> 00:04:22,514
买点感恩礼物当做回报吧
a little thank you to pay them back?

102
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:23,914
所以呢  谢尔顿
So, Sheldon...

103
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:25,644
你看
ta-da!

104
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:27,994
未拆封的经典
A vintage mint-in-box

105
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:30,934
1975年米果公司出产的星际迷航传送机
1975 Mego Star Trek Transporter

106
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:32,494
还会有真实的传送特效
with real transporter action.

107
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:33,664
帅爆了
Hot darn!

108
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:36,774
你去哪里买的啊
Where did you get that?

109
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:38,464
斯图尔特的漫画店里买的
From Stuart, at the comic book store.

110
00:04:38,464 --> 00:04:40,934
你孤身一人走进了漫画店啊
You went to the comic book store by yourself?

111
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,954
是啊  挺好玩的
Yeah. It was fun.

112
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:45,784
我一走进  俩男的立刻被迷得哮喘发作
I walked in, and two different guys got asthma attacks.

113
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,344
感觉真爽啊
Felt pretty good.

114
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,114
这个应该表示一下感谢
This calls for an expression of gratitude.

115
00:04:52,114 --> 00:04:54,674
哟  是不是要给我一个罕见的谢氏拥抱
Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?

116
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:57,054
这次不行  不然我的拥抱就掉价了
No, not this time. Then they wouldn't be special.

117
00:04:57,654 --> 00:04:58,834
谢了  佩妮
Thanks, Penny.

118
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:01,884
不客气
You're welcome.

119
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:04,994
别担心  我没忘记你
Don't worry, I didn't forget about you.

120
00:05:05,194 --> 00:05:06,974
莱纳德  我给你买了
Leonard, I got you...

121
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,704
一个标签机
a label-maker!

122
00:05:15,764 --> 00:05:17,464
哇
Wow...

123
00:05:18,414 --> 00:05:19,534
真好
No, it's great.

124
00:05:19,534 --> 00:05:22,614
也是全新没开封的
Also mint-in-box. Mm.

125
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,094
我也给你买了个传送机
And I got you a transporter, too!

126
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,954
太帅了
Awesome!

127
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:34,064
这是专门配我的珍藏版史波克模型的呢
Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr. Spock action figure.

128
00:05:34,064 --> 00:05:36,084
那太好了  我们快拆开把他放进传送机吧
Oh, that's great! Let's open them up and put him in there.

129
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,874
-打开?!  -老天啊  不行
- Open it?! - Oh, good Lord, no!

130
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:40,384
为什么  玩具不是拿来玩的吗
Why? They're just toys.

131
00:05:40,384 --> 00:05:42,304
-拿来收藏的  -全新没开封的
- They're collectibles. - They're mint-in-box.

132
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,194
拜托  打开来看看也不行吗
Come on. Can't we open one up and take a look?

133
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,674
不行
No, don't!

134
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:49,594
一旦开封了就不值钱了
Once you open the box, it loses its value.

135
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:53,074
我妈也曾教育我  要用这种态度对待童贞
Yeah, yeah. My mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity.

136
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:56,974
不过我觉得  与其收着发霉
Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun

137
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:58,974
不如拿出来多晒晒"太阳"
taking it out and playing with it.

138
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:04,854
你确定要我们陪你见相亲对象吗
Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?

139
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:05,604
确定
Oh, yes.

140
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:06,644
按照我们的习俗
In my culture, it's expected

141
00:06:06,644 --> 00:06:09,144
相亲时就得带个伴来帮过过眼
to have a chaperone to oversee a first date.

142
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,354
况且我想留个好印象  说了你们别生气
Plus, I want to make a good impression, and no offense,

143
00:06:11,354 --> 00:06:14,634
跟你们在一起  我看上去就像一米八的
but with you guys here, I look like I'm six-two.

144
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:19,714
我们高中舞会时修女也老是盯着我们
The nuns always chaperoned the dances at my high school.

145
00:06:19,714 --> 00:06:22,974
她们总是要我们保持距离  留点空间给圣灵
They used to make us leave room between us for the Holy Spirit.

146
00:06:23,874 --> 00:06:25,174
印度人也这样
Uh, Hindus do the same thing.

147
00:06:25,174 --> 00:06:27,254
只不过他们留空间给牛
Except they leave room for a cow.

148
00:06:29,054 --> 00:06:31,324
我很欣赏你的种族歧视幽默感
Listen, I love your charming racist humor,

149
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,474
但能不能别在女人面前  嘲笑我的宗教信仰呢
but any chance you could not mock my religion while she's here?

150
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,304
你昨天还笑我吃熏鲑鱼呢
Yesterday, you made fun of me for eating lox.

151
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:38,514
那不一样  你们犹太人又不崇拜鲑鱼
It's different, your people don't worship lox.

152
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:40,644
显然你没跟我堂兄妹吃过早午餐
Clearly, you've never been to brunch with my cousins.

153
00:06:42,224 --> 00:06:44,364
包办婚姻是不是双方父母一旦决定
So, arranged marriages-- the parents just decide

154
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:46,204
你们就得结婚
and then you have to get married?

155
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,994
不是  我有说话权的
No, no, I get a say in it.

156
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:49,954
不过我相信不管什么样的人来
But I'm sure whoever shows up will be better company

157
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:53,614
杰迈玛大婶和巴特沃斯夫人均为食品品牌名称

158
00:06:49,954 --> 00:06:51,064
都比跟杰迈玛大婶和巴特沃斯夫人
than the threesome I've been having

159
00:06:51,064 --> 00:06:53,614
在厨房里玩3P要好得多
with Aunt Jemima and Mrs. Butterworth.

160
00:06:55,864 --> 00:06:57,564
请问  你是拉杰什吗
Excuse me, are you Rajesh?

161
00:06:57,564 --> 00:06:58,794
我是
Ah, yes.

162
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:00,054
你应该是拉克希米吧
You must be Lakshmi.

163
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,044
很高兴认识你
Uh, nice to meet you.

164
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,584
我也是
Nice to meet you, too.

165
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:04,944
这两位是我朋友
Oh! These are my friends.

166
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:06,454
-这位是伯纳黛特  -你好
- This is Bernadette. - Hello.

167
00:07:06,454 --> 00:07:08,184
-这位是霍华德  -幸会
- And this is Howard. - Nice to meet you.

168
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,284
-幸会  -请坐
- You, too. - Please, have a seat.

169
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,704
双重婚礼有戏了
I'm thinking double wedding.

170
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:19,784
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper.

171
00:07:22,914 --> 00:07:24,164
库珀博士
Dr. Cooper?

172
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:27,554
谁在说话
Is someone there?

173
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:30,244
在这里  你桌子上
Down here. On your desk.

174
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:35,414
史波克
Spock?

175
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,524
我需要跟你谈谈
I need to speak with you.

176
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,574
太奇妙了
Fascinating.

177
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,744
唯一合乎逻辑的解释就是  这是梦
The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.

178
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:47,954
做梦也不是唯一合乎逻辑的解释
It is not the only logical explanation.

179
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:50,344
比如  你之所以产生幻觉
For example, you could be hallucinating

180
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,434
是因为被某物砸到头  比如说
after being hit on the head by,say,

181
00:07:52,434 --> 00:07:54,154
椰子
a coconut.

182
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:58,884
我真的被椰子砸到头了?
Was I hit on the head by a coconut?

183
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:01,774
我不想就此做出任何回应
I am not going to dignify that with a response.

184
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:04,874
先说要紧事
Now to the matter at hand.

185
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:07,814
你要玩这个传送机玩具
You need to play with the transporter toy.

186
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:09,474
可这是全新没开封的
But it's mint-in-box.

187
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:10,214
没错
Yes.

188
00:08:10,214 --> 00:08:12,664
而且开封了就毁了它的价值
And to open it would destroy its value.

189
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,314
但你要记住  你跟我一样
But remember, like me,

190
00:08:15,694 --> 00:08:17,914
也有一半人类血统
you also have a human half.

191
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,914
我不想就此做出任何回应
Well, I'm not going to dignify that with a response.

192
00:08:21,564 --> 00:08:23,064
你想一想
Consider this.

193
00:08:24,054 --> 00:08:25,594
玩具的意义在于什么
What is the purpose of a toy?

194
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,074
给人玩
To be played with.

195
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:30,274
那么  不给人玩意味着...
Therefore, to not play with it would be...?

196
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,284
不合常理
Illogical.

197
00:08:31,284 --> 00:08:33,174
该死  史波克  你说得对
Damn it, Spock, you're right.

198
00:08:35,174 --> 00:08:36,494
我这就开封
I'll do it.

199
00:08:36,574 --> 00:08:39,034
谢尔顿  等等
Sheldon, wait.

200
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,794
你得先醒来
You have to wake up first.

201
00:08:41,794 --> 00:08:43,314
当然
Oh, of course.

202
00:08:43,604 --> 00:08:46,024
先设好相位仪  对吧
Set phasers to dumb, right?

203
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:49,424
赶紧  赶快  马上
Goodie, goodie, goodie!

204
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:53,424
这样不对  这样不对
This is wrong, this is wrong.

205
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,464
太兴奋了  可这样不对
I'm so excited, but this is wrong.

206
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:00,354
我要开封了
I'm going to do it.

207
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,274
我在开封了
I'm doing it.

208
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,024
开完了
I did it.

209
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:12,114
跟我想象中的1975年的味道一样
That's what I always thought 1975 smelled like.

210
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:18,554
斯科特  送我下去
One to beam down, Mr. Scott.

211
00:09:18,554 --> 00:09:20,494
遵命  史波克
Aye, aye, Mr. Spock.

212
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:22,074
启动
Energize.

213
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:27,534
启动
Energize.

214
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,874
别坏啊
Don't be broken.

215
00:09:41,474 --> 00:09:43,554
求求你  千万别坏
Oh, please, don't be broken.

216
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,794
瞧你让我干的好事
What did you make me do?!

217
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:51,774
冷静冷静  动动脑子
Okay, okay, think.

218
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:00,114
这样完全合乎常理
It's only logical.

219
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,158
天啊  这真是太好吃了
My goodness, that was delicious.

220
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:11,408
我希望你还吃得下巧克力软心蛋糕
Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake.

221
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:13,028
不错嘛
Impressive.

222
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:15,248
你怎么想到做这个
What goes into making something like that?

223
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,868
其实呢  最开始
Well, you start out by trying to

224
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:19,788
我是想做巧克力酥的  结果失败了  我慌了
make chocolate souffl? And when it falls, you panic,

225
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:22,878
赶紧改个名字  当当  就变成软心蛋糕了
quickly change the name, and voila, lava cake.

226
00:10:23,888 --> 00:10:26,868
我们的家长现在肯定很想知道进展如何
I bet our parents are dying to know how things are going here.

227
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:28,938
一起看看
Well, let's see.

228
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:32,288
没错  有三通未接电话
Yep, three missed calls.

229
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:34,048
四通未接电话  两条短信
Four missed calls, two text messages

230
00:10:34,048 --> 00:10:36,428
一次视频聊天邀请失败  我赢了
and a failed video chat. I win!

231
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:40,498
那我们该怎么跟他们说呢
So, what are we going to tell them?

232
00:10:41,138 --> 00:10:43,118
我觉得一切进展顺利
I'd like to tell them things are going well.

233
00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:44,228
同意
Me, too.

234
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,788
但在燃起他们的希望之前
But before we get their hopes up,

235
00:10:45,798 --> 00:10:48,848
得先弄清楚我们的步调是否一致
we should probably make sure we're on the same page.

236
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,428
好
Okay.

237
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:52,438
那你现在走到哪一步
What page are you on?

238
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:56,018
我现在走到  父母不断施压
I'm on the one where I'm under a lot of pressure

239
00:10:56,018 --> 00:10:58,658
逼我结婚定下来
from my parents to get married and settle down

240
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,928
组建家庭
and have a family,

241
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:02,698
所以我会乖乖结婚  好隐瞒我是拉拉的事实
and I'm going to do it so they don't find out I'm gay.

242
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:07,048
你说什么
Say again?

243
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:08,998
我是拉拉
I'm gay.

244
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,808
好比男男
Like... dude-on-dude,

245
00:11:11,808 --> 00:11:13,388
但你是女女吗
but with women?

246
00:11:14,288 --> 00:11:16,998
我知道假结婚的只是一场骗局
I know a fake marriage isn't an honest way to live,

247
00:11:16,998 --> 00:11:18,938
但你一定比其他人更理解  我们的文化中
but you of all people should know how difficult it is

248
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:20,768
出柜是多么难以被接受
to come out in our culture.

249
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:23,238
为什么我比其他人更理解
Why me of all people?!

250
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,448
你老家新德里那里有传言  说你...
Well, there's a rumor back in New Delhi that you're--

251
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:27,848
委婉点说好了
how shall we say--

252
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,868
身穿男服  心在纱丽
comfortable in a sari.

253
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,308
我不是基佬
I'm not gay!

254
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:34,698
真的吗  巧克力软心蛋糕
Really? The chocolate lava cake,

255
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:36,128
浴室的小肥皂
the little soaps in the bathroom,

256
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,068
而且  你身上的"香水"味比我还重呢
and I'm sorry, but you're wearing more perfume than I am.

257
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:43,068
那可是科勒和拉马尔的"固若金汤"
That's Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar.

258
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:46,438
顺便告诉你一下  这是中性香水
And for your information, it's unisex.

259
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:48,768
玩个填空游戏吧
Fill in the blank.

260
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:50,158
我爱夜生活
I love the nightlife...

261
00:11:50,158 --> 00:11:51,468
我爱布"基"[舞蹈]
I like to boogie.

262
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:52,498
露馅了吧
Got you.

263
00:11:52,498 --> 00:11:55,238
是跟女人跳  我爱跟女人跳布吉
With women! I like to boogie with women!

264
00:11:56,728 --> 00:11:58,008
真让人失望
That's disappointing.

265
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,388
你就是我想要的带"把儿"假老公
You were exactly the kind of phony-baloney husband

266
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,018
最完美的人选
I was looking for.

267
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,988
谢谢
Thank you.

268
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:06,718
重申一次  我的"把儿"喜欢女人
And once again, my baloney likes girls.

269
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,358
慢着
W-W-Wait!

270
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,158
在没尝过我自制的香堤伊奶油之前
You don't want to put a bite of that in your mouth

271
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:15,168
最好先一口都别吃
without trying my homemade Chantilly cream.

272
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,228
好吧  这次我听出来基味了
Yeah, okay, that time I heard it.

273
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,208
天啊
Oh, dear.

274
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:37,788
两个太阳  没带防晒乳
Two suns and no sunscreen.

275
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,248
你好  谢尔顿
Hello again, Sheldon.

276
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,118
又怎么了  小小史波克
What is it now, Tiny Spock?

277
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:50,648
我对你非常失望
I am very disappointed in you.

278
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:53,308
你弄坏了自己的玩具  然后偷换给莱纳德
You broke your toy and switched it with Leonard's.

279
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:55,628
你应该为自己的行为感到羞耻
You should be ashamed of yourself.

280
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,948
是你让我玩玩具的
You're the one who told me to play with it.

281
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:00,548
那我让你从进取号的舰桥上跳下来
If I told you to jump off the bridge of the Enterprise,

282
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:01,808
你会照办吗
would you do it?

283
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:04,998
如果我上了进取号的舰桥
Oh, if I got on the bridge of the Enterprise,

284
00:13:05,008 --> 00:13:07,278
我死也不会跳出去
I would never, ever leave.

285
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,448
相信我  很快就会玩腻了
Trust me, it gets old after a while.

286
00:13:13,308 --> 00:13:15,408
你必须改正你的错误  谢尔顿
You must right your wrongs, Sheldon.

287
00:13:15,408 --> 00:13:17,918
为什么  我成功蒙混过关了
Why? I got away with it.

288
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:21,158
莱纳德有他的玩具  而且永远也不会打开
Leonard has his toy, and he's never going to open it,

289
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:22,548
所以不会知道那是坏的
so he won't know it's broken.

290
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:24,878
而我得到了一个完好无损的玩具
And I have a toy that isn't broken.

291
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,118
皆大欢喜
Everybody's happy.

292
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:28,028
错  我不开心
Well, I am unhappy.

293
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:34,958
《星际迷航》史波克是人类与瓦肯人的混血
瓦肯人是个几乎能克制所有情感的种族

294
00:13:28,028 --> 00:13:30,918
我以为你是来自无情绪星球的呢
I thought where you come from they don't have emotions.

295
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:34,958
我来自台湾的一家玩具工厂
I come from a factory in Taiwan.

296
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:38,008
现在快去改正错误
Now, do the right thing.

297
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:39,918
知道你是什么吗
You know what you are?

298
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,538
瓦肯人有绿色的血液

299
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:42,538
你是个冷血的扫兴绿鬼
Well, you're a green-blooded buzz kill.

300
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:45,238
你现在还是赶紧传送走吧
Perhaps it's time you beam on out of here.

301
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:46,148
好吧
Fine.

302
00:13:46,148 --> 00:13:48,308
我用传送机把自己传送走吧
I will just use the transporter.

303
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:49,958
哎呀  我忘了
Oh, right.

304
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:51,758
你把它弄坏了
You broke it.

305
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:54,688
很好
Very well.

306
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:57,988
库珀呼叫进取号  请求传送一人
Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up.

307
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,858
开始传送
Energize.

308
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,068
小小史波克  救命啊
Tiny Spock, help.

309
00:14:19,168 --> 00:14:19,868
要去吃午餐了吗
Ready for lunch?

310
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,188
要的  等一下
Yeah, one sec.

311
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,018
好了  我老妈要是发现
Oh, good. Ma would've killed me

312
00:14:24,018 --> 00:14:26,258
我把牙保持器弄坏了会杀了我的
if she found out I broke my retainer.

313
00:14:29,808 --> 00:14:32,208
我可以跟你谈个事情吗  跟拉希米有关
Can I run something by you? It's about Lakshmi.

314
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,308
好  说吧  发展得怎么样了
Yeah, sure. How are things going?

315
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:35,838
我们有几个小问题
We hit a couple of bumps.

316
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:37,238
她住在曼哈顿海滩
She lives over in Manhattan Beach,

317
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,298
我得花一个小时才能到她家
so it takes, like, an hour to get there.

318
00:14:39,768 --> 00:14:41,128
而且她是个拉拉
And she's a lesbian.

319
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:44,888
你说她是"拉拉"是什么意思
What do you mean, "she's a lesbian"?

320
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:47,188
还记得每次我们去酒吧泡妞
Well, you know how whenever you and I would try

321
00:14:47,188 --> 00:14:49,158
只要失败了  我们就会互相安慰
to hit on women in bars and they'd blow us off

322
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,778
说那女的铁定是同性恋吗
and then we'd tell each other they were probably gay?

323
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:52,958
就像那样啊
It's like that.

324
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:54,898
只是这次  她是真的同性恋
Except this time, it's true.

325
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,788
那她干嘛还出来跟你相亲啊
Then why did she even go out with you?

326
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:01,848
她想找个老公假结婚来掩盖事实
She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight.

327
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,688
虽然这主意
And, you know,

328
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:04,748
乍听之下挺疯狂的
it sounded crazy to me at first...

329
00:15:05,888 --> 00:15:08,238
但我真的有考虑跟她结婚
but I'm actually thinking about doing it.

330
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:12,228
这事情乍听就很疯狂是因为
Okay, so the reason that might sound crazy...

331
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:13,718
这本来就很疯狂啊
is 'cause it's crazy!

332
00:15:14,968 --> 00:15:17,038
霍华德  你有女朋友了
Look, Howard, you're in a relationship.

333
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,758
你当然不用妥协
You know you have to make compromises.

334
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:22,448
但我要妥协的是  买哪种床单
Yes, but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy

335
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:24,468
或者今天该轮到谁洗衣服啦
or whose turn it is to do the laundry,

336
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:26,368
伯纳黛特还是我妈
Bernadette's or my mom's.

337
00:15:29,808 --> 00:15:31,058
跟她结婚很合算啊
It's a great deal.

338
00:15:31,058 --> 00:15:33,148
我和她都能摆脱父母的控制
We both get our parents off our backs,

339
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:35,678
每晚回家不用再面对空荡荡的屋子
I don't have to come home to an empty apartment every night.

340
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:38,468
再说结了婚  我就尽情吃碳水化合物了
Plus, once I'm married, I can finally eat carbs again

341
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:40,548
据说不吃碳水化合物能减肥  控制身材

342
00:15:38,468 --> 00:15:40,548
不用再担心身材问题
and let myself go.

343
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,408
何不告诉你父母
Why don't you tell your parents

344
00:15:43,408 --> 00:15:45,778
你想另寻意中人
you want to try to find someone else?

345
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,128
或许找个睡过的女人比你少的伴儿
Maybe one who hasn't slept with more woman than you.

346
00:15:49,878 --> 00:15:52,018
但这个女人想跟我结婚
Because this one wants to marry me.

347
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,218
我从没找到过想跟我结婚的女人
I might never find another one who does.

348
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:56,608
所以你真的是在慎重考虑
So you're seriously thinking about marrying someone

349
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,878
要过无性婚姻吗
you're never gonna have sex with?

350
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:00,558
不敢相信你是这态度
I can't believe your attitude.

351
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:03,538
你不是向来支持同性恋婚姻的吗
I thought you were in favor of gay people getting married.

352
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:07,268
没错  我支持的是双方都是同性恋
Yes, to other gay people!

353
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,768
你知道你这话有多"恐同"吗
Do you hear how homophobic you sound?

354
00:16:51,988 --> 00:16:54,268
我才不想要坏的
Oh, I don't want a broken toy.

355
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:58,888
没事
Nothing!

356
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:01,958
什么
What?

357
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,668
没事  我说了没事
Nothing. I said nothing.

358
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:05,298
好诡异
That was weird.

359
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:07,398
真的吗  他的诡异早被我当正常了
Really? I don't even notice anymore.

360
00:17:09,368 --> 00:17:11,608
我真不敢相信  你们真的不拆出来玩
I cannot believe you guys aren't gonna play with these.

361
00:17:11,608 --> 00:17:14,148
我说了你不信嘛  全新未开封不能拆
Well, I told you, you don't. It's mint-in-box.

362
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:16,868
我不知道  只是觉得浪费
I don't know. I just think it's a waste.

363
00:17:22,188 --> 00:17:24,328
放心啦  我只看看盒子
Relax. I'm just looking at the box.

364
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:26,068
你光用眼睛看就行了
Perhaps you should look with your eyes

365
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,068
把你那肌肉发达的汉子手拿开
and not your muscular Nebraska man hands.

366
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,158
你到底怎么回事啊
What is your problem?!

367
00:17:32,158 --> 00:17:35,688
我就是怕你弄坏莱纳德的玩具
My problem is that I don't want you to break Leonard's toy.

368
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,418
万一你摇一摇  就摇坏了呢
Which you probably did by shaking it!

369
00:17:37,418 --> 00:17:39,238
她摇过了  我们都看到了啊
She shook it, we all saw her.

370
00:17:40,788 --> 00:17:41,888
莱纳德  我送你这个
Leonard, I bought you this

371
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,898
只是想让你玩得开心
'cause I wanted you to have fun with it.

372
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:46,048
我不想它一直呆在盒子里不见天日
I don't want it to sit in this box.

373
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,718
你说得对
You know, you're right.

374
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,128
这可是你送我的
I mean, it's from you,

375
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,788
我不可能拿出来卖
I'm never gonna sell it.

376
00:17:52,108 --> 00:17:53,808
-我这就拆吧  -太好了
- I'm opening it. - Yes!

377
00:18:05,508 --> 00:18:07,078
-是坏的  -什么
- It's broken. - What?

378
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:09,218
瞧你干的好事  汉子手
Oh, nice job, man hands!

379
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,768
不是我弄坏的
I didn't break it.

380
00:18:12,768 --> 00:18:15,398
估计斯图尔特卖给我的时候就这样了
I guess Stuart sold it to me like this.

381
00:18:15,528 --> 00:18:17,598
没错  肯定是他
Yes. Yes, he did.

382
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,028
这是最最最可信又最最最合理的解释...
That is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explana...

383
00:18:21,028 --> 00:18:23,068
要怪就怪斯图尔特吧
Let's all be mad at Stuart!

384
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:25,758
这玩意老贵了
You know, I paid a lot for this.

385
00:18:25,758 --> 00:18:27,068
我们拿回店里给他看吧
Let's take it over there and show him.

386
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:28,448
绝对要的
Absolutely.

387
00:18:31,328 --> 00:18:32,468
等等
Wait!

388
00:18:36,108 --> 00:18:37,338
是我干的
It was me.

389
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,138
是我拆开了你的玩具...
I opened your toy...

390
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,418
发现是坏的  却没有告诉你
discovered it was broken and didn't tell you.

391
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:47,128
你为什么要拆我的
Why would you open mine?

392
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:48,808
我没有  我说谎了
I didn't. That was a lie.

393
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:52,038
我拆开了自己的
I opened my own toy...

394
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:55,238
发现它已经坏了  所以跟你换了个
and it was already broken, so I switched them.

395
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:57,828
那你该跟斯图尔特说啊
You should talk to Stuart.

396
00:18:57,828 --> 00:18:59,598
不能说  我又说谎了
I can't, because that was a lie.

397
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:04,378
你的玩具在地震中坏了...
Yours was broken in an earthquake--

398
00:19:04,378 --> 00:19:05,618
还是说谎
and that's a lie.

399
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:10,168
真相到底是什么
What is the truth?

400
00:19:11,238 --> 00:19:12,748
我的玩具史波克先生托梦给我
My Mr. Spock doll came to me in a dream

401
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:14,228
逼我拆开了盒子
and forced me to open it.

402
00:19:14,228 --> 00:19:18,148
玩具坏掉以后  我就偷换了你的
And when the toy broke, I switched it for yours.

403
00:19:18,478 --> 00:19:20,158
后来他鼓励我改正错误
Later, he encouraged me to do the right thing,

404
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:21,698
而我拒绝了他
and I defied him.

405
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,988
然后我就被葛恩追杀了
And then I was attacked by a Gorn.

406
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:23,988
葛恩:星际迷航中虚构的物种

407
00:19:28,758 --> 00:19:30,558
好吧  这个我信
Okay, that I believe.

408
00:19:31,528 --> 00:19:33,498
莱纳德  佩妮  我要对你们说
Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know

409
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:36,068
我很后悔之前对两位所做的事
that I regret my actions towards the two of you.

410
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,318
我又说谎了
That's a lie.

411
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:40,918
这么说  那个是我的咯
So, is that one mine?

412
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,868
-是的  -那给我吧  我来拆开
- Yes. - Well, hand it over so I can open it.

413
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,228
好吧
Okay.

414
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,538
莱纳德  虽然我的玩具坏了
And, Leonard, even though I don't have one anymore,

415
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:50,358
我还是希望你玩得开心
I hope you have fun playing with it.

416
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,038
-你又说谎了吧  -弥天大谎
- And that's a lie, right? - It's a big, fat whopper.

417
00:19:54,688 --> 00:19:56,158
我真心希望这个是坏的
I hope it breaks.

418
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:03,747
欢迎大驾光临
This is a treat.

419
00:20:03,757 --> 00:20:05,767
什么风把你们吹来了
What brings you guys by?

420
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:09,167
拉杰  华仔跟我说了你和拉希米的事
Raj, Howie told me what's going on with you and Lakshmi.

421
00:20:09,377 --> 00:20:10,647
你居然告诉她了
You told her?

422
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:12,427
我还告诉所有人了呢
I told everybody.

423
00:20:14,617 --> 00:20:17,307
我们相信你一定会找到一个真心爱你的人
We believe there's someone out there who will love you for you.

424
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:20,097
其实在这点上  我们各持不同意见
Actually, we kind of agreed to disagree on that one,

425
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:23,487
但我们一致认为  你不该跟她结婚
but we both think you shouldn't marry this woman.

426
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:26,367
所以当我在等待这个可能存在  也可能不存在的
So, while I'm waiting for this mysterious perfect match

427
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:29,757
神秘真命天女时  就该一直单身下去吗
who may or may not exist, I'm supposed to just be alone?

428
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:31,507
那倒未必
Not necessarily.

429
00:20:31,617 --> 00:20:35,707
我们为你找了个可以相依偎的伴
I think we found someone for you to cuddle with.

430
00:20:35,727 --> 00:20:39,377
我的老天
Oh, my goodness.

431
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:43,597
你可真是史上最可爱的小狗狗
Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever!

432
00:20:44,947 --> 00:20:46,267
他真的是送我的吗
You got him for me?

433
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:49,227
是"她"  你俩肯定合得来
Her. We thought you two would hit it off.

434
00:20:49,227 --> 00:20:51,317
我俩一拍即合
I think we already have.

435
00:20:51,317 --> 00:20:53,507
太感谢你们了
Thank you guys so much.

436
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,597
一般男用钱包称wallet  女用钱包称purse

437
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:56,597
来看看你能不能装进我男用手包里去
Let's go see if you fit in my man purse.

438
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,407
异性恋  骗谁呀
Heterosexual, my ass.
