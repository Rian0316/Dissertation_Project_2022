00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:22,134
真希望我能知道他们的名字
I wish I knew their names.

10
00:00:22,136 --> 00:00:25,104
研究提到了那些不受欢迎的小孩吗?
Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?

11
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,573
你说呢... 早上你床头睡的那位就是
You tell me... you woke up in bed with one.

有什么建议吗?
of the camera. Any words of advice?

26
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:56,569
有的 不要因为导演叫你脱衣服
Yes. Don't take your shirt off

27
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,971
你就真脱
just because the director said so.

28
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,207
这是一个关于Spock先生的纪录片
This is a documentary about Mr. Spock.

29

西哥特人跟我拼命呢
Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.

把游戏暂停一下 Howard
Pause the game, Howard.

我知道你在这儿长大 对这里的一切
I get that you grew up here and you're attached to things

保持原状抱有执念 但是...
looking a certain way, but...

52

我也想让这里像我的家
I want this to feel like my house, too.

53
00:02:05,364 --> 00:02:07,995
亲爱的 这里当然是你的家
Oh, honey, of course it's your house.

54
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:11,197
不然你什么老是打扫呢?
Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?

55
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:15,268
好吧 重新开始
All right. Let's start over.

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,569
我准备重新装修
I'm redecorating.

57
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,705
家具 地毯 墙纸
The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.

00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:21,541
我要把所有看不顺眼的东西都换了
I'm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it.

59
00:02:21,543 --> 00:02:23,610
你最好别成为其中之一
Try not to be one of those things.

60
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,179
我能说句话么?
May I say something?

61
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,214
是你爸爸在小时候离开了你现在你妈妈又死了
Is it about how I can't have new wallpaper

62
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:30,617
所以我不能装新墙纸吗?
'cause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?

63
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,385
没事了
Never mind.

64
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,390
嘿 Amy 我是Sheldon
Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

65
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,692
我知道我们已经分手了 
Yeah, I-I know that we're broken up, but

66
00:02:39,694 --> 00:02:41,995
我留言是因为我估计你可能想来看
I'm leaving this message because I thought perhaps you'd like

67
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:45,665
我为一部关于Spock先生的纪录片接受的采访
to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock.

68
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,435
或者用我的叫法 Spock录片
Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.

69
00:02:49,437 --> 00:02:50,803
是的 我打算在
Yeah, I'm going to use

70
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:52,906
采访中用这个梗 所以
that joke in the interview, so try to laugh

71
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:55,174
要像第一次听到那样狂笑哦
like you're hearing it for the first time.

72
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,976
歇斯底里的那种 嗯?
You know, hysterically, hmm?

73
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,880
再带上一点悲伤的情绪因为我已经从你的生活中消失了
And with a tinge of sadness that I'm no longer in your life.

74
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:03,449
想出Spock录片的人是我
I'm the one who thought of "Spockumentary"

75
00:03:03,451 --> 00:03:05,919
而我还像第一次听到那样狂笑
And I'm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.

76
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:10,990
嗨
Hello.

77
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,058
嘿 Sheldon
Hey, Sheldon.

78
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,192
这是Adam Nimoy
This is Adam Nimoy.

79
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:15,628
- 很高兴见到你  - 哦 很高兴见到你
- Nice to meet you.  - Oh, it's nice to meet you.

80
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,997
我非常喜欢你父亲的作品
I admire your father's work very much.

81
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:20,800
我并不是每天都能遇见生命旅程
It's not every day I get to meet someone whose life's journey

82
00:03:20,802 --> 00:03:23,303
从我心目中的英雄的阴囊里开始的人
began in my hero's scrotum.

83
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,508
我跟你说过 这家伙很极品
I told you. This guy is gold.

84
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:34,347
你在干什么?
Whatcha doing? Oh!

85
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,983
用我妈的方法给自己做个腊肠三明治
Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me

86
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,586
就像我爸离家后 我妈去世前她给我做的一样
after my dad left, but before she died.

87
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,224
听着 我想着
Okay, listen, I'm thinking

88
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,627
在房子的问题上我们可能可以折衷一下
that maybe we can compromise on the house.

89
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,163
我在听
I'm listening.

90
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:53,132
我们先重装一个房间看看效果如何
Let's just redo one room and see how it goes.

91
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:54,500
这还差不多
That is reasonable.

92
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:56,402
但是哪间呢?
But what room?

93
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,004
这间怎么样?
How 'bout this one?

94
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:02,709
没门 这是我和我妈互动最多的一间
No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom.

95
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:04,644
那浴室怎么样?
Then how 'bout the bathroom?

96
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:07,513
我要反悔
I want to change my answer.

97
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:10,216
好的 那就餐厅
Fine. Then the dining room.

98
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:12,852
我们不太用餐厅
I guess we didn't use it very often.

99
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,220
除非有客人
Unless we had company.

100
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,756
在我爸离开后不常有 而在我妈死后
Which didn't happen much after my dad left and not at all

101
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:17,470
就完全没有了...
after my mom...

102
00:04:17,494 --> 00:04:19,174
好极了! 我要去选几个油漆样本
Great! I'm gonna go pick out paint samples.

103
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,030
好的 我们就简单谈几句
All right, we're just gonna have a conversation.

104
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:26,366
假装这里没有摄像机
Pretend the camera's not here.

105
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:28,501
好的 这最好不是
All right. But this better not be

106
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:31,104
什么精心设计的让我脱衣服的诡计
some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.

107
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:34,540
你认识Adam多久了?
How long have you known Adam?

108
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:35,975
有些年头了
A few years. Mm-hmm.

109
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:39,112
你把他找回来干嘛?
And what are you getting him back for?

110
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:41,748
从你的名字和职业开始吧
Let's start with your name and occupation.

111
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,785
Sheldon Cooper博士 理论物理学家 供职于加州理工大学
Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech.

112
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:49,656
关于Spock这个角色你最初的记忆是怎样的?
And what is your earliest memory of the character Spock?

113
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:54,293
星际迷航原初系列里我看的第一集 
The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw

114
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:56,295
是"伽利略七号"
was "The Galileo Seven."

115
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:59,732
Spock刚刚在金牛二号行星上登陆
Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II.

116
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,268
这时候我哥走了进来 坐在我头上
Then my brother came in, sat on my head,

117
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,971
说 "吃屁吧"
and said, "Eat farts."

118
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,740
那天之后 我就迷上了它
After that day, I was hooked.

119
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:09,442
指的是星际迷航
On Star Trek,

120
00:05:09,444 --> 00:05:12,478
不是我哥的括约肌烹饪
not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.

121
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:16,916
Spock吸引你的地方在哪?
What was it about Spock that appealed to you?

122
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,986
我想是同样吸引了所有人的东西
I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere,

123
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,955
一个金色的 理性的 
the dream of a cold, rational world

124
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:25,091
泯灭人类感情的世界的梦想
entirely without human emotion.

125
00:05:25,093 --> 00:05:27,060
Spock是从
Spock came

126
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:29,095
一个完全由逻辑统治的行星上来的
from a planet governed only by logic.

127
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:31,364
在瓦肯星 当你的哥哥问你
You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks,

128
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:33,900
"你为什么自残?"的时候 回答是
"Why are you hitting yourself?" the answer is,

129
00:05:33,902 --> 00:05:35,268
"我没有啊
"I'm not.

130
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,103
是你在动我的手臂"
You're moving my arm."

131
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:39,639
关于此他的评价是
To which he says,

132
00:05:39,641 --> 00:05:41,007
“真厉害”
"Fascinating."

133
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:44,844
然后俩人一起快乐的看教育台
And then you both watch educational television.

134
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:46,646
哦 他说那些话的时候
Aw. When he says things like that,

135
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,815
我真想抱抱他给他安慰
I just want to hug him and make everything better.

136
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,850
我哥哥也对我很差
My brother was mean to me, too.

137
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:52,518
肯定是你太熊了
Yeah, you probably had it coming.

138
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:56,589
你有Spock系列收藏品吗?
Do you have any Spock collectibles?

139
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,657
多了去了
I have many.

140
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,093
我最宝贝的是我的贴心好友Penny
My most treasured is an autographed napkin

141
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,829
送我的签名餐巾纸
given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny.

142
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:04,163
她就坐在那儿
That's her over there.

143
00:06:06,401 --> 00:06:08,601
嗨!
Hi!

144
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,636
看哪
Look at that.

145
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:14,273
没脱衣服 进了电影
I'm in a movie, my shirt stayed on.

146
00:06:14,275 --> 00:06:16,008
能看看这张餐巾纸吗
Can we see the napkin?

147
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,477
当然 稍等
Of course. Excuse me.

148
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:18,978
马上就来
This will just take a moment.

149
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,392
我们什么时候有了墙嵌保险箱?
When did we get a wall safe?

150
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:37,730
地嵌保险箱满了的时候
When there was no more room in the floor safe.

151
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,533
什么时候多了地嵌保险箱?
When did we get a floor safe?

152
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:43,503
装监控摄像头的时候
When we got the security camera.

153
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:45,738
还有监控摄像头?
There's a security camera?

154
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,675
潜水侠 从2012开始为您守护
Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012.

155
00:06:51,646 --> 00:06:54,680
天哪 我们在那张沙发上嘿咻过
Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.

156
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,516
我一清二楚
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

157
00:06:59,154 --> 00:07:01,454
你岳父在厨房里?
So, your father-in-law is in there right now?

158
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:02,688
对 挺我
Yes. So back me up.

159
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,991
房子保持原样就很好 明白
The house is good the way it is. Oh, okay. Got it.

160
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:07,760
嘿 你们在干嘛
Hey. What's going on?

161
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:09,228
嘿 嘿 Raj
Hey. Hey, Raj.

162
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,764
爸爸和我准备把这面墙打掉
Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall.

163
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,536
真的吗? 这可是面很好的墙
You sure? It's a... pretty great wall.

164
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,271
怎么说?
What's so great about it?

165
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:21,340
抱歉 我尽力了
I'm sorry. I did what I could.

166
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,545
真的吗? 你带Raj来替你说话?
Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?

167
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,213
你有你爸爸
Your dad's on your side.

168
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,682
他可不是来帮我说话的 他来当免费工
He's not on my side. He's doing all the work for free.

169
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:32,585
您真是慷慨
That is so generous of you.

170
00:07:32,587 --> 00:07:36,589
我换边站了
I'd like to switch sides.

171
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:37,857
听着..
Look, uh...

172
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:39,458
你不可能打掉这面墙
I don't even think you can take this wall down

173
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,660
它可是承重的
'cause it's load-bearing.

174
00:07:40,662 --> 00:07:41,928
这挺容易
Well, it's easy to find out.

175
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,130
到地板下面地基里检查一下就行
Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check.

176
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,866
为什么你还不滚回印度?
When is your visa up?

177
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,338
他不仅在这上面给我签了名
Not only is it signed to me

178
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,173
还用这张纸擦了嘴
but this is where he wiped his mouth.

179
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:58,644
所以我手上拿的是Leonard Nimoy的DNA
So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

180
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:02,114
Adam不算Leonard Nimoy的DNA吗?
Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

181
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:06,052
无意冒犯 但我这可是100%的Nimoy
No offense, but this is pure 100% Nimoy.

182
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:08,855
因为你母亲的遗传 你只有50%Nimoy的DNA
Because of your mother, you're only 50%.

183
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:11,424
这虽然没什么坏处
Which isn't bad,

184
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:15,261
但是你用来擦嘴的东西只会被扔掉
but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.

185
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:17,597
纸巾的话题就到此为止
Okay, enough about the napkin.

186
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:18,631
你还在里面藏了什么?
What else you hiding in there?

187
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:19,899
你想知道吗?
Wouldn't you like to know?

188
00:08:19,901 --> 00:08:21,567
- 当然想  - 那好吧
- I would.  - All right then.

189
00:08:22,437 --> 00:08:23,502
看到了吗 都是我的宝贝
See? Just my valuables.

190
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:27,273
- 我的护照 我的遗嘱...  - 你还有遗嘱?
- My passport, uh, my will...  - You have a will?

191
00:08:27,275 --> 00:08:29,909
当然了 我的一比十八大小的Wil Wheaton手办
Yeah... my 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure.

192
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:33,145
我还有其他类型的遗嘱
I also have the other kind of will,

193
00:08:33,147 --> 00:08:37,350
我希望死后这个模型能留给Wil
and in it I will my Wil back to Wil.

194
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:38,317
Wil会想要吗?
Will Wil want it?

195
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:39,752
Wil很嫌弃
Wil won't.

196
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:42,121
那个戒指盒是什么?
What's that ring box?

197
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,189
那是一枚
Oh. That is

198
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,490
订婚戒指
an engagement ring

199
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:46,692
我本来打算给我的女朋友Amy的
that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.

200
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,494
什么!
What?!

201
00:08:49,998 --> 00:08:51,631
你给她买了一枚戒指?
You bought her a ring?

202
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:52,665
这是我家祖传的
No, no, no. This has been in my family

203
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:55,668
只有一段时间遗失了
for generations. Except for a short time

204
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,137
就在Comanches切掉我曾曾曾祖母的手指
when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmother's

205
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:00,306
偷了戒指的时候
finger and stole it.

206
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:02,555
可怜的Sheldon 太惨了
Sheldon, that's awful. No.

207
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:04,757
德州骑警一路追到他们的村子里
The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village

208
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,426
把他们杀得一个不剩...
and slaughtered every last one of them, so...

209
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:09,729
结局还是很好的
it was a happy ending.

210
00:09:09,731 --> 00:09:13,032
至少对我九指的祖母来说
Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

211
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:15,868
说回戒指的事 Amy知道吗?
Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?

212
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:19,072
不知道 在我说出来之前她就和我分手了
No. She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.

213
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:21,607
好可怜 那真是在你心上插了一刀啊
Oh, man, I'm sorry... that must have been devastating for you.

214
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,109
没有 我很好
No, not at all. No, I'm fine.

215
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,378
Amy对自己的感情有所保留
You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship,

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,046
所以现在一切都很好
so all worked out for the best.

217
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:30,216
- 我明白 只是...  - 我说了我没事!
- I know. It just...  - I said I'm fine!

218
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:37,757
我们跑题了
We've gotten a little off-topic.

219
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,093
让我来使一切重回精彩吧
Allow me to make things entertaining again

220
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,962
继续”Spock录片"
in this little Spockumentary.

221
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,935
那是Leonard的梗
That was Leonard's joke.

222
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:02,182
小时候 每当我进退两难
As a child, when faced with a dilemma,

223
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,618
我妈妈总是鼓励我问一句"耶稣会怎么做?"
my mother encouraged me to ask, "What would Jesus do?"

224
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,989
答案总是"爱你的邻居"
The answer to that was always, "Love thy neighbor."

225
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:13,493
但我的邻居满口蛀牙...
But my neighbor had a dead tooth, so...

226
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,662
所以这不可能了
that wasn't going to happen.

227
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,497
但是...
But...

228
00:10:17,499 --> 00:10:21,634
这也让我转而问"Spock会怎么做?"
that's why I changed it to, "What would Spock do?"

229
00:10:21,636 --> 00:10:23,236
那样有用吗?
Did you find that helpful?

230
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:26,039
是的 例如 三年前
Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago

231
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,808
当我发现Penny偷吃我的Pop-Tarts的时候
when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

232
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,578
比起怀恨在心
instead of getting angry or vindictive,

233
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,214
我选择装一个地嵌保险箱
you know, I got a floor safe.

234
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,517
挡不住的香味啊
I knew I could smell 'em.

235
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
那你小的时候呢?
What about from when you were a kid?

236
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,122
当然了 在我八岁的时候
Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old,

237
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:44,391
Billy Sparks把我逼到操场的角落里
Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground.

238
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,826
我问自己"Spock会怎么做呢?"
I asked myself, "What would Spock do?"

239
00:10:46,828 --> 00:10:49,362
我抓住了Billy的肩膀
Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder

240
00:10:49,364 --> 00:10:52,732
第一次实施了瓦肯擒拿术
and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch.

241
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,368
起作用了?
Did it work?

242
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,670
没... 他打断了我的锁骨
Oh, no... he broke my collarbone.

243
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:02,108
我现在都能听到锁骨咔咔响
I can still hear it click.

244
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,558
你一定沮丧惨了
That must have been very upsetting for you.

245
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,079
才没有呢
Oh, not at all.

246
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,947
正如我说的 模仿Spock的精髓就在于
As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock

247
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:10,350
超越人类情感
was to rise above human emotion,

248
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:12,552
我会用尽一生去掌握
which I've spent a lifetime mastering.

249
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,087
呵呵
Oh...

250
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:16,990
你什么意思?
Excuse me?

251
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:19,125
不好意思 当我不存在
I'm sorry. I'm not here.

252
00:11:19,127 --> 00:11:21,594
你嘘我了 什么意思?
No. You went... What does that mean?

253
00:11:21,596 --> 00:11:22,962
额...
Um...

254
00:11:22,964 --> 00:11:25,098
你确实嘘他了
You did go

255
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,267
好吧 Sheldon 虽然我不是专家
All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert,

256
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,869
但你是不是没抓住Spock的重点呢?
but aren't you completely missing the point of Spock?

257
00:11:29,871 --> 00:11:31,171
虽然他表现得像是没有感情
I mean, he liked to act

258
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,473
但他还是有一半人类基因啊
like he had no emotions, but he was still half human.

259
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:34,941
和你一样
Just like you.

260
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,577
你表现得没有感情
I'm just saying, you pretend you don't,

261
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,312
但你也还是一个有血有肉的人
but you have feelings just like everybody else.

262
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:41,781
不是的 看着我
Not true. No, look at me.

263
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:44,050
我打算向一个女孩求婚
I had an engagement ring to give a girl,

264
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,618
但她拒绝了我
and instead, she rejected me.

265
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,487
我变得情绪化了吗? 没有
And am I emotional about that? No.

266
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,656
我坐在沙发上
No, I am sitting here on a couch,

267
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:51,458
谈论着我最喜欢的电视人物
talking about my favorite TV character

268
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,792
就像什么都没发生
like nothing happened.

269
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:55,361
因为我和Spock一样 永远只有逻辑和理性
'Cause I am just like him: all logical, all the time.

270
00:11:55,363 --> 00:11:56,429
亲爱的 你都开始冲我喊了
Sweetie, you're yelling.

271
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,031
因为我用正常声音说话的时候
Because when I speak at a regular volume,

272
00:11:58,033 --> 00:11:59,232
你们都不相信
no one seems to believe me

273
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:01,167
我早就不在乎Amy什么的了!
that I've put this Amy nonsense behind me!

274
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:10,677
这个纪录片绝对超赞的
This documentary is gonna be awesome.

275
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,915
- 你在这里感觉还好嘛?  - 没事 挺好的
- You gonna be okay down here?  - Yeah. Yeah,

276
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,383
我感觉自己像个考古学家
I feel like an archaeologist.

277
00:12:17,385 --> 00:12:20,854
像是Indiana Jones与独栋别墅
Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling.

278
00:12:21,723 --> 00:12:23,490
嘿 看啊!
Hey. Look!

279
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,391
我捡了个贝壳
Found a seashell.

280
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,595
其实是老鼠的骨头
Yeah, that's a rat skull.

281
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:30,497
淡定
Relax.

282
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,067
这的灰尘够多的了 你就别再折腾了
There's enough droppings down here without you making more.

283
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:37,570
抱歉 你知道... 这里是什么位置吗?
Sorry. Do you have a... sense of where we are?

284
00:12:37,572 --> 00:12:39,506
大概吧 我觉得那边是小客厅
Yeah. I think that's the den.

285
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,375
好吧 那这里就是餐厅了
Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room.

286
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,776
没错
Uh-huh. Yep.

287
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:46,546
那个 我知道你可能不太想听我说这件事
You know, I know you don't want to hear this,

288
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,282
不过把小客厅改造成婴儿室
but it wouldn't take that much work to turn that den

289
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:51,084
也不会很费事
into a nursery.

290
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:53,286
我为什么会不想听你说这件事?
Why wouldn't I want to hear it?

291
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:55,588
因为Bernie说你不想要孩子
'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.

292
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,357
不是这样的
That's not true at all.

293
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,791
我... 我很希望
I... I wish

294
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,693
她能怀上一个宝宝 真的
she'd get pregnant, believe me.

295
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:04,497
一有机会我就扑倒她
I'm climbing on top of her every chance I get.

296
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,935
那个... 当然我也很温柔的
In a... loving and respectful manner.

297
00:13:08,937 --> 00:13:09,969
唔
Oh.

298
00:13:11,239 --> 00:13:12,539
重点是
The point is,

299
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,542
我真的很想要孩子
I really do want kids.

300
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,076
是嘛
Huh.

301
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:19,712
我不知道她为什么没跟你说实话
I don't know why she's lying to you.

302
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,681
不过 明明是她不想要孩子的
She's the one who doesn't want kids.

303
00:13:21,683 --> 00:13:23,383
而且 每次我提起这件事的时候...
In fact, every time I bring up the subject...

304
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,218
地震啦!
Earthquake!

305
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,589
天啊 咱俩死定了!
Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

306
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,491
地震啦!
Earthquake!

307
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:35,295
余震啦...!
Aftershock...!

308
00:13:36,464 --> 00:13:39,199
我真不敢相信 Sheldon居然想向Amy求婚来着
I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.

309
00:13:39,201 --> 00:13:40,700
是啊 我也完全没想到
I know. I also can't believe

310
00:13:40,702 --> 00:13:42,635
他看了我们在沙发上做的事之后
he watched what we did on that couch

311
00:13:42,637 --> 00:13:44,871
- 还继续坐在那里  - 是啊
- and still sits on it.  - Yeah.

312
00:13:46,474 --> 00:13:48,241
嗨
Hello.

313
00:13:48,243 --> 00:13:49,576
嘿 你怎么样了?
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

314
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,610
好点了
Better.

315
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,612
- Will和Adam都走了吗?  - 走了
- Did Wil and Adam leave?  - Yeah.

316
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:54,981
你说他们会不会把我情绪失控的样子
Do you think they're going to put my outburst

317
00:13:54,983 --> 00:13:56,316
也放在纪录片里播出来?
in the documentary?

318
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:58,418
- 绝对会  - 肯定的
- Definitely.  - Oh, yeah.

319
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,921
再这样纠结下去一点意义也没有
Well, there's no point in dwelling on it.

320
00:14:01,923 --> 00:14:03,489
就像瓦肯人说的那样
As the Vulcans say,

321
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:07,460
"你能让被你杀死的东西起死回生吗" (瓦肯语)
"Kup-fun-tor ha'kiv na'ish Du stau."

322
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,630
- 你知道这句话是什么意思吗?  - 不知道
- Do you know what that means?  - No.

323
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,798
真的吗?
Are you telling the truth?

324
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,900
假的 (瓦肯语)
Nirsh.

325
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:17,604
我这个样子太荒唐了 一直为Amy的事纠结
Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy

326
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,339
是不会有任何帮助的
all the time isn't accomplishing anything.

327
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:21,074
我要是想解决这个问题
If I want to resolve this situation,

328
00:14:21,076 --> 00:14:22,709
就需要付诸行动
then I need to take action.

329
00:14:22,711 --> 00:14:24,911
- 你要干嘛?  - 我要去找她
- What are you gonna do?  - I'm going to find her

330
00:14:24,913 --> 00:14:26,045
问她愿不愿意嫁给我
and ask her to marry me.

331
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,481
如果她说愿意 这事就算过去了
And if she says yes, we can put this behind us

332
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:30,216
我们可以恢复我们的关系
and resume our relationship.

333
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:31,918
如果她不愿意...
And if she says no...

334
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,355
那她就可以"去死了(瓦肯语)"
well, then she can just ponfo miran.

335
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,059
他开玩笑的
He didn't meant that.

336
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:48,001
我觉得我大概有必要解释一下为什么撒谎
So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.

337
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:53,806
你最好解释一下
That would be nice.

338
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:56,142
我跟我老爸说 是你不想要孩子
I told my dad that you were the one

339
00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:59,245
因为我不想让他失望
who didn't want kids because I didn't want to disappoint him.

340
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,881
那你觉得让我背这个锅就没问题了?
But you were okay throwing me under the bus?

341
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:05,184
看起来是没什么问题啊 我也没多想
Turns out yeah, I didn't think twice about it.

342
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:08,655
Bernie 你不用考虑我是怎么想的
Bernie, you don't need to worry about me.

343
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,224
可是我不希望你失去这个机会
But I don't want to see you miss out.

344
00:15:11,226 --> 00:15:12,792
把你带大
Raising children

345
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:15,795
是我这辈子最有收获的一件事
was the most rewarding experience of my life.

346
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:17,463
得了吧 所有事都是妈妈做的
Oh, please. Mom did everything.

347
00:15:17,465 --> 00:15:19,699
你就是每天下了班
All you did was come home from work,

348
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,434
回家坐在沙发上喝啤酒
sit on the couch and drink beer.

349
00:15:21,436 --> 00:15:23,369
这和带孩子有什么关系?
How is that raising kids?

350
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:25,071
还是你们夫妻俩
This is really

351
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,106
好好聊聊这件事吧
a conversation for husband and wife.

352
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:30,209
我去收拾干净就先走了
I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road.

353
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:33,279
对了 要是你妈问起来 就说我在这待到十点多才走
If your mother asks, I was here till 10:00.

354
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,718
真有意思 你老爸并没帮上什么忙
It's interesting your father didn't help around the house

355
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Howard也没有
and Howard doesn't help, either,

356
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,188
所以... 从某种角度上来看
so... in a way,

357
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,557
Howard不光像你老爸
Howard's not only like your father,

358
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:49,295
还像你不太想要的那个孩子
but he's also like the child that you're afraid to have.

359
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,298
你为什么还不走?
Why are you still here?

360
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:56,135
好吧 我这就撤
Fine, I'll leave.

361
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:59,272
不过我感觉有人得换尿布了
But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper.

362
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:05,712
好吧...
All right...

363
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,781
我承认... 我没帮上什么大忙
I admit... that I don't help out a lot.

364
00:16:08,783 --> 00:16:11,517
这一点我还要努力
And I need to work on that.

365
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,652
不过...
But...

366
00:16:12,654 --> 00:16:14,187
如果我有个孩子的话
if we had a kid,

367
00:16:14,189 --> 00:16:15,455
我一定会有所不同的
it would be different.

368
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:17,090
- 为什么?  - 因为...
- Why?  - Because...

369
00:16:17,092 --> 00:16:19,425
我父亲离开的时候
when my dad left,

370
00:16:19,427 --> 00:16:21,794
我曾经对自己保证过...
I promised myself that...

371
00:16:21,796 --> 00:16:26,232
如果有一天 我也能成为一个父亲的话...
if I ever had a chance to be a father...

372
00:16:26,234 --> 00:16:28,634
我一定会永远陪在孩子身边
I'd always be there.

373
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:32,338
好吧 我好好考虑一下这件事
Okay, I'll think about it.

374
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,407
你是说认真的会"好好考虑一下"
And this an actual "I'll think about it,"

375
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,442
而不是“能不能买个带副驾的摩托
not like the "can we get a motorcycle

376
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:38,978
我会考虑一下”的意思吗?
with a sidecar I'll think about it"?

377
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,615
我真的会"好好考虑一下"
It's an actual "I'll think about it."

378
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:46,519
我一定可以做一个好父亲的
I really believe I'd be a great dad.

379
00:16:46,521 --> 00:16:48,988
我相信你
I know you would.

380
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,790
既然说到生孩子...
Speaking of...

381
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:53,259
要不要我现在洗洗干净
making babies, what do you say I wash up

382
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:55,895
然后也来探索一下你的狭小的空间?
and poke around your crawlspace?

383
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,744
Dana医生觉得他没有那么危险
Dr.Dana feels he isn't that dangerous.

384
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,246
凭什么你的判断是对的 而一个有经验的精神科医生是错的?
What makes you right and a trained psychiatrist wrong?

385
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,515
因为她有感情 而我没有
Because she feels. I don't.

386
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,050
我只知道逻辑
All I know is logic.

387
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:41,752
是啊 没错
Yeah, right.

388
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,722
你倒是可以说没感情就没感情
You can just shut your feelings off.

389
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:47,091
电视剧又一次欺骗了我们
There goes television, lying to us again.

390
00:17:47,093 --> 00:17:48,292
我们都放心把孩子
We let you

391
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:49,393
托付给你们了
raise our children,

392
00:17:49,395 --> 00:17:51,428
你们就这样回报我们的
and this is the thanks we get.

393
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,897
Leonard 你说我怎么会愚蠢到
Leonard, how could I have been so foolish

394
00:17:53,899 --> 00:17:56,033
想要像一个电视剧里的
to try and follow in the footsteps

395
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,902
虚拟的外星人一样没有感情?
of a made-up alien race with no emotions?

396
00:17:58,904 --> 00:18:00,471
其实...
Well...

397
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,473
你现在不再崇拜虚拟的角色了
now instead of idolizing fictional characters,

398
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:06,443
可以多关注一下你生活中的人
you can focus on the real people who are already in your life.

399
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,280
说的有道理
Those are very wise words.

400
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:11,482
谢了
Thank you.

401
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:12,883
要是这句话是电视剧里出现的
They'd just be so much more comforting

402
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,585
就更能安慰到我了
if they came out of a television.
