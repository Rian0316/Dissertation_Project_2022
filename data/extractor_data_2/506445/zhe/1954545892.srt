美丽的艾琳艾德勒 留在他模糊朦胧的记忆中

福尔摩斯和我在贝克街
Holmes and I had been sharing rooms in Baker Street

14
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,217
共居多年了
for some years.

15
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,345
因为行医 我离家去乡间
My practice had caused me to be absent in the country

16
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,305
小住了几日
for several days.

17
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,643
照例 不管离开福尔摩斯多久
As usual, after leaving Holmes for any length of time,

18
00:03:05,726 --> 00:03:10,815
每当回家 我都为他的情绪担忧
I returned filled with apprehension as to his mood.

19
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,656
你好 哈德森夫人
Oh, hello, Mrs. Hudson.

20
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:23,494
华生医生 瞧瞧你 都湿透了
Dr. Watson, just look at you, half soaked to the skin!

21
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:24,412
那就对了
Yes, well, I am not surprised,

22
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,707
我在瓢泼大雨中站了20分钟
I have just spent 20 minutes standing in the pouring rain

23
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,416
就为等辆马车
waiting for a cab.

24
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,793
当心你的旧伤
It won't do that old wound of yours any good

25
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,503
医生 淋这么湿
getting so wet, Doctor.

26
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,337
我知道
I know.

大衣和帽子给我
I'll just take this coat and your hat

28

哈德森太太 我饿了一天了

真希望马上开饭

31
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,931
这可难说
That's very doubtful.

32
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,558
不知福尔摩斯先生怎么了
I don't know what's come over Mr. Holmes,

33
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,393
他好像紧张得要命
he seems to be all on edge.

34
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:50,313
等他叫我  再送晚饭上去
I'm not to bring up supper until I'm called.

35
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,065
他下的命令
Those are his orders.

00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,651
谢谢你 哈德森太太

37
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,443
我亲爱的福尔摩斯
My dear Holmes,

38
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:51,249
今晚是什么 吗啡还是可卡因?
what is it tonight, morphine or cocaine?

39
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,877
啊 我强烈推荐
Well, I can strongly recommend

40
00:04:55,002 --> 00:05:00,967
百分之七的可卡因溶液
a seven percent solution of cocaine.

41
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,636
你想试一试吗?
Would you care to try it?

42
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:06,556
算了吧
No, indeed!

43
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,141
我不仅作为朋友 而且作为医生跟你说
I speak not only as your friend, but as a medical man.

44
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:13,646
你怎么能如此戕害
How can you risk such damage to the great powers

45
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,107
你天赋的卓越能力
with which you have been endowed?!

46
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,607
我难以形容
I cannot tell you

47
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,776
它多么提神醒脑
how it clarifies and stimulates the mind.

48
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,321
是 最后把头脑毁掉
Yes, and destroys it in time!

49
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:29,829
我的头脑讨厌停滞状态
My mind rebels at stagnation.

50
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:34,625
给我问题 给我工作
Give me problems, give me work,

51
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,419
给我最艰深的密码
give me the most abstruse cryptogram,

52
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:41,591
最复杂的分析 我才最在状态
the most intricate analysis, and I'm in my proper atmosphere.

53
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:46,345
那就能省掉人工的兴奋剂
Then I can dispense with artificial stimulants.

54
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,766
但我憎恨一潭死水的生活
But I abhor the dull routine of existence.

55
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,688
我渴望精神上的兴奋
I crave mental exultation.

56
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:57,857
因此我才选择这行
That is why I have chosen my own profession,

57
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,276
或者说创造这行
or rather created it,

58
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,863
因为我是世上唯一一个
for I am the only one in the world.

59
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,699
唯一的私家侦探
The only unofficial detective.

60
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,660
唯一的私家咨询侦探
The only unofficial consulting detective.

61
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,913
我办案不求名声
I take no credit in my cases.

62
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:12,705
工作本身
The work itself,

63
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,374
发挥我特殊能力的快乐
the pleasure of finding a field for my particular powers

64
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,461
才是最高奖励
is my highest reward.

65
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,636
你可以把抽屉合上了
You can close that drawer.

66
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,014
你诊断错了 医生
You have made the wrong diagnosis, Doctor!

67
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:35,436
兴奋剂在这里
I have my stimulant here.

68
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,818
希望你在乡间过得愉快
I hope you enjoyed your week in the country.

69
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,612
至少让胃口很好
It was good for the appetite.

70
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:48,658
顺便说 我真希望你打铃叫晚饭了
Incidentally, I do wish you would ring for supper.

71
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,913
这是什么?
What is this?

72
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:57,083
对 我在等客人
Yes, I must get ready for my visitor.

73
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,212
随早班邮件过来的
It came by the morning post.

74
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,592
讲讲你的观察
Give me your observations.

75
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:11,681
它没标日期 也没有签名或地址
Well, it's undated and without either signature or address.

76
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,518
很好 大声读
Good, read it aloud.

77
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,520
"亲爱的福尔摩斯先生"
"Dear Mr. Holmes:

78
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,815
"今晚七时三刻 将有"
There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight

79
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,859
"某君前来"
a gentleman who"-

80
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,527
天 就差几分钟了 福尔摩斯
good heavens, we've only a few minutes, Holmes.

81
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,280
继续
Go on.

82
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,365
"某君前来商谈"
"A gentleman who desires to consult with you

83
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,410
"至关重要之事"
upon a matter of the very deepest moment.

84
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,620
"阁下近来为欧洲某王室效力"
Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe

85
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,622
"证明阁下足堪信赖"
have shown that you are one who may be safely trusted

86
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,167
"可以难以言喻之"
with matters which are of an importance

87
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,170
"重大事务相托"
which can hardly be exaggerated.

88
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:46,465
"此种传述 广播四方 我等知之甚稔"
This account of you we have from all quarters received,

89
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,051
"届时望勿外出"
be in your chamber then. "

90
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,721
天 还真是神秘啊
Good-good heavens, this is a mystery, indeed.

91
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,139
你想这是什么意思?
What do you imagine it means?

92
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,557
我还没有事实
I have no data yet.

93
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,226
没有事实妄加推测 那是大忌
It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.

94
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,853
但就便条本身
But the note itself,

95
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,148
你能推断些什么?
what do you deduce from it?

96
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,065
是男人的字迹
It's a man's writing.

97
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,859
很好
Good.

98
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,487
大概很有钱 这纸很贵
Presumably well-to-do, it's expensive paper, this.

99
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,156
纸质结实挺括得出奇
It's peculiarly strong and stiff.

100
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,866
出奇 正是这样
Peculiar, that is the very word.

101
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,701
这不是英国造的纸
It is not English paper at all.

102
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,579
举起对光看看
Hold it up to the light.

103
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:21,709
啊 大写的E 小写的g 大写的P和G
Ah, large E, small g, large P, and G

104
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,129
还有个小t 交织在一起
with a small t woven into the texture.

105
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,423
所以呢?
And that is?

106
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,550
制造者的花押印
Maker's monogram.

107
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,843
漂亮 华生
Excellent, Watson!

108
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,221
过来
Come along!

109
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,809
我们来查查<大陆地名词典>
Let us consult our continental gazetteer.

110
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,687
你的雪茄 你瞧 我可没忘了你要回来
Your cigars; you see, I was not unmindful of your return.

111
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,730
哦 福尔摩斯
Oh, Holmes!

112
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,232
来点威士忌吗?
Would you care for some whiskey?

113
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,526
等会 晚餐再说吧
Later, perhaps, when we've eaten.

114
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,363
花押是Papier Gesellschaft的缩写
The monogram is an abbreviation for Papier Gesellschaft,

115
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,740
德文里的"造纸公司"
which is the German for "paper company. "

116
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:59,539
而Eg Eglow Eglonitz Egria
And the Eg, Eglow, Eglonitz, Egria,

117
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,541
说德语的波希米亚区
a German-speaking district of Bohemia

118
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,584
有大批玻璃作坊
noted for its numerous glass factories

119
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,378
和造纸厂 看
and paper mills, there.

120
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,922
波希米亚 波希米亚王国
Bohemia, the kingdom of Bohemia.

121
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,966
便条是个德国人写的
And the note is written by a German.

122
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,592
你看 "此种传述"
You see, "this account of you

123
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,469
"广播四方 我等知之甚稔"
we have from all quarters received,"

124
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,888
只有德国人这么乱用词句
only a German is so uncourteous to his words.

125
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,767
所以客人是波希米亚的德国人
So we are to expect a German from Bohemia.

126
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,356
他来了
Here he is,

127
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:30,736
乘漂亮的两驾小马车
drawn by a pair, a nice little brougham.

128
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,239
这案子至少有赚头 如果没别的
There's money in this case, Watson, if there's nothing else.

129
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,783
福尔摩斯 客人来了我还是回避吧
Holmes, I think your visitor will want me out of the way.

130
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:38,452
绝对不用 医生 呆在这
Not a bit, Doctor, stay where you are!

131
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,455
我可离不开我的传记作家
I am lost without my Boswell.

132
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,084
可他说得那么秘密
But he sounded so secretive.

133
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,420
我可能需要你帮助 他也是
I may need your help, and so may he.

134
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,755
在椅子里坐好 集中精神听
Now, stay in that armchair, and give me your full attention.

135
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,424
他来了
Here he comes.

136
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:01,434
抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, sir,

137
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,603
你不能就这么闯进来
but you cannot come in here unannounced like this!

138
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:07,356
福尔摩斯先生不见未预约的客人
Mr. Holmes does not see anybody without appointment!

139
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,619
哦 我很抱歉      福尔摩斯先生
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Holmes!

140
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,537
我拦不住他
There was nothing I could do!

141
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,540
完全没关系 哈德森夫人
It's perfectly all right, Mrs. Hudson!

142
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,875
请您先离开
If you would kindly leave us.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,459
好的
Yes.

144
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,084
关上门
And close the door.

145
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:27,668
当然
Of course.

146
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,463
谢谢
Thank you.

147
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,726
你收到信了?
You read my note?

148
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:45,394
是的 请坐下
Yes. Pray take a seat!

149
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,233
我的朋友和同事 华生医生
This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson,

150
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,152
他偶尔好心地帮我办案
who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases!

151
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,780
您好 先生
How do you do, sir.

152
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,830
请问您怎么称呼?
Who do I have the honor to address?

153
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:09,377
你可以叫我冯克拉伯爵 波希米亚贵族

我更愿意和您单独谈

164
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,818
这事就无关紧要了
the matter will be of no importance.

165

目前 它的分量

保证遵约
I promise.

情况十分微妙

得不惜一切代价防止丑闻发生

177

I was aware of that, too, your Majesty.

183
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,478
你说得对
You are right...

184
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,904
我就是国王

185
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,657
我何必隐瞒呢?
Why should I attempt to conceal it?

186
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,243
何必呢?

00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,494
陛下尚未开口
Your Majesty had not spoken

188
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:08,496

00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:16,169
亲爱的华生 我想独自呆一会
My dear Watson, I'd like to be alone.

312
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,003
你饿了?
You are hungry?

313
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,171
是
Yes.

314
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,381
哈德森夫人准有三明治
I'm sure Mrs. Hudson will bring you up a sandwich.

315
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,007
三明治?
A sandwich?

316
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,759
明天下午我们再谈
We will not discuss this matter until tomorrow afternoon.

317
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,887

Briony Lodge

320
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,546
比干活轻巧 是吧伙计?
Better than working, isn't it, mate?

321
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,588
什么?
What is?

322
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,131
看人干活
Looking on.

323
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:48,219
真想跟你换换 兄弟
I'll change with you any time, gov.

324
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,388

And what position are you?

325
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,725
八周 头等马车夫
Eight weeks, a mere first-class groom.

326
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,811

Are ya?

327
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,438
你可以帮我一把
Well, you can give me a hand if you like.

328
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:04,277
我看你不用
I see you're all right.

329
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,945
为什么不呢?
Why not?

330
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,573
只要有酒钱
Give her the price of the booze.

331
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:14,871
我想也是酒钱
I thought it was the booze.

332
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:21,043
拴马去 看你能干什么
Strap the mare, show us what you can do.

333
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:53,743
我跟马夫一伙呆了几个小时
I spent a couple of hours with the cabbie and his cronies.

334
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,162
艾琳艾德勒小姐
Miss Irena Adler

335
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:59,999
她倾倒了那一带所有男人
has certainly turned all men's heads in those parts.

336
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,670
她是世上最俏丽的佳人了
She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet,

337
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:10,510
塞彭泰恩大街马房 人人都这么说
so say the Serpentine-mews fraternity, to a man.

338
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:13,262
她生活平静
She lives quietly,

339
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,640
每天下午五点出去
drives out at five in the evening,

340
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:19,435
七点整回家吃晚餐
returns at seven sharp for dinner.

341
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,605
深居简出 只除了演唱
Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.

342
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,859
她只有一名男客 可是过从甚密
She has only one male visitor, but sees a good deal of him.

343
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:29,195
他每天至少来一回 经常是两回
He never calls less than once a day, and often twice.

344
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,490
他叫戈弗雷诺顿 住在坦普尔
His name is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple.

345
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:36,202
这就是跟车夫交朋友的好处
You see the advantages of having a cabman as a confidant.

346
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:42,708
戈弗雷诺顿先生是律师 这很关键
Mr. Godfrey Norton is a lawyer, that is important.

347
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,753
也许还有些不妙
Ominous, perhaps.

348
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:50,550
为什么他不断地来?
Why his repeated visits?

349
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:56,389
她是他的委托人 朋友 还是情妇?
Is she his client, friend, or mistress?

350
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,182
如果他是她的律师
If he is her lawyer,

351
00:25:58,266 --> 00:26:03,271
照片也许在他保险柜里
he might have the photograph to his strong box.

352
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:09,110
如果是情人 他可能对照片一无所知
If her lover, he might not even know of it.

353
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,788
当时她刚开口唱歌
She had just begun to sing,

354
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:05,208
她有天使般的歌喉 华生
she has the voice of an angel, Watson,

355
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:08,211
那时突然发生了一件奇事
when a truly surprising chain of events overtook me,

356
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,295
有人来访
starting with the arrival

357
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,635
我估计是戈弗雷诺顿
of someone I presumed to be Mr. Godfrey Noble.

358
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,803
等我 好吗
Wait for me, will you.

359
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,522
把夫人的马车接进去
Fetch your mistress's carriage.

360
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,488
拚命快赶
Drive like the devil,

361
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,865
去圣莫尼卡教堂 艾薇尔路
Church of St. Monica, Edgeware Road.

362
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:21,200
最晚十二点差五分要到
I must arrive there at least five minutes before 12:00.

363
00:28:21,284 --> 00:28:25,538
还有20分钟 赶到了赏你半个畿尼
That gives you 20 minutes. Half a guinea if you do it.

364
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:04,410
她真是明艳动人 华生
She is a lovely woman, Watson,

365
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:08,164
容貌足令男人倾倒
with a face that a man might die for.

366
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,251
容貌足令男人倾倒
A face a man might die for-

367
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,087
你从没说过这种话 福尔摩斯
unusual language for you, Holmes.

368
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,797
修辞而已 华生 没别的
A metaphor, Watson, nothing else.

369
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,800
我正想赶上去攀在车后
I was just about to sprint after the landau and perch on the back

370
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,928
恰好一辆出租马车经过
when another cab came through the street.

371
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,555
看我衣衫褴褛 有些犹疑
He looked twice at such a shabby fare,

372
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,266
但我在他拒绝之前跳进车里
but I jumped in before he had time to object,

373
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,684
掏出一把金磅
showed him a handful of sovereigns

374
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,393
答应给他一磅
and promised him one

375
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,021
只要20分钟之内赶到莫尼卡教堂
if he would get me to the Church of St. Monica within 20 minutes.

376
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,857
我从不记得
Now, I don't think

377
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:40,571
坐过这么快的马车
that I have ever been driven faster in a cab.

378
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:45,701
他们比我们先到
They were there before us.

379
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:04,637
很抱歉 诺顿先生 但我
Look, I'm very sorry, Mr. Norton, but I-

380
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,681
发发慈悲吧 已经中午了
For pity sake, it's almost midday.

381
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:08,683
法律规定的最晚时间
The latest time allowed by law.

382
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,685
我可以随便找个牧师来
I would have called in one of those confounded churchmen

383
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,770
但我先前为了不泄密
but I saw no reason to let them know our business

384
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,230
打发他们吃酒去了
and I sent them off for a drink.

385
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,815
哦 上帝啊
Oh, dear Lord!

386
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,442
戈弗雷
Godfrey.

387
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,992
你 过来 伙计
You, you, come here, man!

388
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:30,663
是 就叫你
Yes, I mean you!

389
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,665
我们只剩几分钟了 否则就不合法
We've only a few minutes left or it won't be legal!

390
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,918
快过来 伙计 过来
Come man, come!

391
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:47,180
拿着这个 照吩咐的做
Hold this and do as you're told.

392
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:50,266
我付钱
You'll be paid.

393
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:55,771
啊 有证人了
Ah, we have our witness.

394
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,692
婚礼开始
The ceremony may proceed.

395
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:05,698
诸位朋友 我们今天以神的名义聚集一堂
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here in the sight of God

396
00:31:05,823 --> 00:31:09,368
见证这对男女神圣的婚礼
to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony

397
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:12,330
这一荣耀的仪式由上帝所创造
which is an honorable estate instituted of God

398
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,332
自从鸿蒙初始
in the time of man's innocency,

399
00:31:14,415 --> 00:31:16,751
为我们代表了上帝
signifying unto us the mystical union

400
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,253
与世人间神秘的联结
that is betwixt Christ and his church.

401
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:28,387
艾琳
Irena.

402
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:31,140
我一直听你的
I allowed you to persuade me,

403
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:35,394
现在你得听我一次
now you must allow me to persuade you.

404
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:37,813
我明天再见你
I shall see you tomorrow.

405
00:31:37,939 --> 00:31:41,400
第一时间
At the very first moment.

406
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:44,946
我爱你
I love you.

407
00:32:02,255 --> 00:32:06,551
约翰
John.

408
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,264
嘿 你

Come here, my man.

410
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,441
过来
Come here.

411
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:27,446
戈弗雷 让我来
Godfrey, let me.

412
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,212
先生 我要谢谢你
Sir, I want to thank you

413
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:47,383
在我们需要你的时候奇迹般降临
for being so miraculously present when we needed you.

414
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:50,803
有你在近旁是多么幸运
How fortunate that you have remained close by.

415
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:55,141
反正我也闲着 夫人
Well, I'm in no hurry, mum.

416
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:58,394
我希望你能接受这个
I hope you will accept this.

417
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,066
我不收小费 夫人
I don't need no tip, mum.

418
00:33:04,192 --> 00:33:11,782
先生 就当是个纪念品
Oh, sir, let us call it a little souvenir.

419
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:29,300
她赏我一个金磅
She gave me a sovereign.

420
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,218
在这
Here it is.

421
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:35,264
这也太出乎意料了
What an extraordinary turn of events!

422
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:37,225
我要把它拴在表链上
I shall wear it on my watch chain

423
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:41,145
纪念这次的际遇
in memory of the occasion.

424
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:44,065
现在怎么办?
And what now?

425
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,982
婚礼的时候
Well, during the ceremony

426
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,151
我以为我的计划完了
I thought my plans had been overthrown.

427
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,861
如果他们立刻离开
If they had made an immediate departure,

428
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:49,737
我就不得不
it would have necessitated

429
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,615
立即采取最强硬的措施
the most prompt and energetic measures on my part.

430
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,745
可他回了坦普尔 她回了自己家
But, he went back to the Temple, and she went to her own home,

431
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,582
因此 我们有时间行动
thus, giving us time to act.

432
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,876
怎样?
How?

433
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,421
医生 我需要你所有的勇气和警觉
Doctor, I shall require all your courage and alertness.

434
00:34:07,547 --> 00:34:10,550
乐意效劳
I shall be delighted!

435
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,010
你不怕犯法吗?
You don't mind breaking the law?

436
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,595
一点也不
Not in the least.

437
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:19,767
也不怕万一被捕吗?
Nor running the chance of arrest?

438
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:23,563
只要目标高尚 我不怕
Not in a good cause.

439
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:25,481
噢 这目标再高尚不过了
Oh, the cause is excellent.

440
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,108
好 我听你的
Well, then I am your man.

441
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:28,734
好极了
Splendid.

442
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:08,900
现在 问题是
Now, the- the question is-

443
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:13,488
福尔摩斯 你这造型太棒了
Holmes, you really do look quite remarkable!

444
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:17,825
问题是照片在哪里
You know, the question is where to find the photograph.

445
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,869
我是指 房子被搜了两回
I mean, the house has twice been burgled.

446
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:21,913
她比他们聪明多了
She was too clever for them.

447
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:24,248
她是个了不起的女人
She is a remarkable woman.

448
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:26,250
他们一定仔细查找过了
Well, they must have searched very thoroughly.

449
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,669
那是他们不会查
They did not know how to look!

450
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,172
你要怎么查
And how will you look?

451
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,883
我不查
I shall not look.

452
00:35:34,008 --> 00:35:35,843
那怎么办?
What then?

453
00:35:35,968 --> 00:35:38,179
我会让她自己拿出来
I will allow her to show me.

454
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,642
她肯定不答应
But she'll refused.

455
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:43,809
她不能够
She will not be able to.

456
00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:47,396
啊 快到行动地点
Ah, we draw near the scene of action.

457
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:49,315
最好下去步行
We had better walk from here.

458
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,336
约好的还记得吧
You know your instructions.

459
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:12,713
你一举手 我就行动
When you raise your hand, I act.

460
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,299
10分钟后在约定地点集合
And we meet at the rendezvous in 10 minutes.

461
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,969
她来了
Here she comes.

462
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:31,941
没你份
Oh, no, you don't.

463
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:33,484
我先来的
I was here first.

464
00:36:33,568 --> 00:36:34,694
我开的门 夫人

给人开车门
Opening carriage doors

总得让人赚个铜板吧

00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:53,713
让我过去

从我嘴里抢食 你敢

看我塞上你的嘴 小子

快跑 弟兄们 当心警察

他还有呼吸 但被敲的很重

00:37:48,226 --> 00:37:49,727
他伤得很重吗?
Is he badly hurt?

487
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:53,272
只是皮肉伤 但他马上需要人看护
It is only superficial, but he needs attention, quickly.

488
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,816
不能让他躺在街上
But he can't lie on the street.

抬进屋里去
Bring him into the house.

00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:05,344
我来照看我的患难之交

这不是女士该看的

502
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:27,200
听你的
As you wish.

503
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:55,311
你的伤没有大碍 我松了口气
I'm so relieved that your wound isn't serious.

504
00:39:55,436 --> 00:40:00,816
伤口不深 头也不晕了
Well, it is but shallow, and the concussion wears off.

505
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:13,579
真奇怪
How extraordinary.

506
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,581
夫人?
Madam?

507

这么多人
That so many people

508
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:21,003

都是一伙的 夫人
Well, it's the gang, madam,

510

埋伏好了抢劫你
it was all pre-arranged to rob you.

511
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:29,220
这么多人抢一个小钱包
All those men to snatch one little purse.

512
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:32,265
不 朋友 这根本不值
Oh, no, dear friend, it wouldn't have paid them.

513
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:35,017
我的职责让我常常接近穷人
My vocation takes me much amongst the poor

514
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:36,727
甚至罪犯 夫人
and even the criminal classes, madam.

515
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,605
瞧瞧这些人
Look at those people staring,

516
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:45,736
好奇心很不体面 但恐怕人人皆有
curiosity is so unseemly, but I fear universal.

517
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:50,783
真对不起 我觉得要晕倒了
Oh, I am so sorry, I think I'm going to faint.

518

夫人 夫人 我闻到烟火味了
Madam, madam, I think I can smell fire.

着火了 是吗?
There's a fire, is there?

528
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,971
夫人 快离开这
Madam, come out of here quickly!

529
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,057
我来照顾老先生
I'll take care of the old gentleman!

530
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:01,187
我喘不过气来
I can't breathe.

531
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:04,941
假火警
It's a false alarm!

532
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:08,694
是假火警 瞧
It's a false alarm, look!

533
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:11,739
是个陷阱 告诉他们 告诉他们
It's a trick, it's a- tell them-tell them!

534
00:42:11,864 --> 00:42:14,408
着火了
There's a fire!

535
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:19,747
是假火警 听到了吗
It's a false alarm, do you hear?

536
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:23,167
我们不需要消防车
We do not need the fire engine!

537
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:33,928
这是什么?
What is it?

538
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,513
是个烟火筒 夫人
It is a plumber's rocket, madam,

539
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:39,058
我有个伙计是管子工
one of my flock is a plumber.

540
00:42:39,141 --> 00:42:40,476
顶上点火
It is ignited by a cap,

541
00:42:40,601 --> 00:42:44,730
把烟散到管子里 查找裂缝和洞
and sends smoke into pipes to betray cracks and holes.

542
00:42:44,814 --> 00:42:46,023
不不不 不用了
No, no, no, no, no, it's all right.

543
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:48,651
会散开的

你说是个陷阱

谁会这么陷害我呢?

他们一伙的 夫人
One of the gang, madam.

547
00:42:56,117 --> 00:42:58,911
为什么呢 我已经摆脱了啊
But to what purpose? I've escaped them.

548
00:42:59,036 --> 00:43:01,038
报复
Revenge.

549
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:07,086
报复?
Revenge?

550
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,422
有如此邪恶的人吗?
Are there such wicked people?

551
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:11,591
这世界上有些人 夫人
There are people in this world, madam,

552
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:17,138
将报复本身当作乐趣
to whom revenge is in itself a reward.

553
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:22,643
我无法想像这种感觉
I cannot imagine such feelings.

554
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:25,938
我相信你不能 夫人
I'm sure you cannot, madam.

555
00:43:26,063 --> 00:43:29,609
呃 我觉得我缓过来了
Well, I am feeling more myself.

556
00:43:29,692 --> 00:43:33,196

00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,162
不让我的马车送送你吗?
Won't you let my carriage take you?

560
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:44,582
不用不用 外面的空气有助于我恢复

唉 我只是个虔诚的仆人 夫人

564

You have the photograph?

569
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:33,381

00:44:33,506 --> 00:44:35,007
你怎么找到的?
How did you find out?

571
00:44:35,132 --> 00:44:37,260
她拿出来的 我就说她会的
She showed me, as I told you she would.

572
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,387
麻烦的是 还在她那里
The trouble is, it still remains in her possession.

573
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:41,848
你可能没机会了 福尔摩斯
You may have lost your one chance, Holmes.

574
00:44:41,931 --> 00:44:43,266
不会
No.

575
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,852
我明天早些来拜访
I shall call early tomorrow morning.

576
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:47,019
你去拜访?
You'll call there?

577
00:44:47,103 --> 00:44:49,730
作为我本人 陪同国王去
And as my own self, and with the King.

578
00:44:49,856 --> 00:44:50,314
国王?
The King?!

579
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:52,650
你也去 华生
And with you, Watson!

580
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:55,736
你必须作整件事的见证人
You must be a witness at the end of our quest.

581
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:25,474
至少你今天能睡个好觉了 福尔摩斯
I trust you will sleep well tonight for a change, Holmes.

582
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,395
成功对治疗失眠最好不过了

还有华生
and Watson.

585
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:36,944
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

586
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,918
但她不可能爱上他
But she could not love him.

587
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,419
我希望她有
I am in hopes that she does.

588
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:54,128
为什么?
Why?

589
00:45:54,253 --> 00:45:55,338
因为这样就为陛下
Because it would spare your Majesty

590
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,256
省去了无穷后患
all fear of future annoyance.

591
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,760
如果她爱她的丈夫 她就不爱陛下
If she loves her husband, then she does not love your Majesty.

592
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:02,178
如果她不爱陛下
And if she does not love your Majesty,

593
00:46:02,303 --> 00:46:06,307
她何必干涉陛下的婚事呢
why should she interfere with your Majesty's marriage.

594
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,733
是夏洛克福尔摩斯先生吧
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe.

595
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,401
我是福尔摩斯
I am Mr. Holmes.

596
00:46:17,485 --> 00:46:20,530
我们夫人说你大概会来的
My mistress told me you were likely to call.

她和他先生乘五点十五分的火车
She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train

598
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:26,410
从查林十字车站到欧洲大陆去了

599
00:46:26,536 --> 00:46:28,120
她离开了英国?
She has left England?

600
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:30,623
再也不回来了 先生

福尔摩斯 不是这张照片
Holmes, this is a different photograph!

605
00:47:13,583 --> 00:47:18,296
你听到没 伙计?
Do you hear me, man?!

"亲爱的夏洛克福尔摩斯先生 干的漂亮"
"My Dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes: You did it very well.

609
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:33,186

You took me in completely.

610
00:47:33,269 --> 00:47:36,606
"直到火警之前 我一点没怀疑"
Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion.

611
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:39,150
"但是随后我发觉自己泄露秘密时"
But then, when I found that I had betrayed myself,

612
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,276
"我突然想起"
it flashed into my mind

613
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:43,196
"几个月前就有人警告我防备你了"
that I had been warned against you months ago.

614
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:45,740
"据说如果国王要雇侦探"
I had been told that if the King employed an agent

615
00:47:45,865 --> 00:47:47,074
"那一定是你"
it would certainly be you.

616
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,493
"尽管如此"
Yet, with all this,

617
00:47:48,576 --> 00:47:51,621
"你还是使我泄了密"
you made me reveal what you wanted to know.

618
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:54,081
"即使先前在那么多人聚在街上"
Even before when the presence of so many people in the street

619
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:57,043
"使我有所警觉"
had sounded an alarm in my instinct,

620
00:47:57,168 --> 00:48:02,590
"我都不曾想到如此可爱的老牧师会有恶意"
I could not think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.

621
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:06,427
"但是 你知道"
But, you know,

622
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:09,430
"我本人就是训练有素的女演员"
I have been trained as an actress myself,

623
00:48:09,555 --> 00:48:12,808
"男扮女装并不陌生"
and male costume is nothing new to me.

624
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:17,230
"对 是我尾随你到家"
Yes, it was I who followed you to your door,

625
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:17,855
"就是来确定"
just to make sure

626
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:22,693
"你真是著名的福尔摩斯"
that you really were the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes.

627
00:48:22,777 --> 00:48:27,532
"是我冒失地祝你晚安"
It was I who rather imprudently, wished you goodnight.

628
00:48:27,615 --> 00:48:31,035
"接着去坦普尔找我丈夫"
Then I started for the Temple to see my new husband.

629
00:48:31,118 --> 00:48:32,328
"我们秘密结婚"
We had married in secret

630
00:48:32,453 --> 00:48:36,249
"以防万一需要出国躲避国王"
in case we needed to leave the country to elude the King.

631
00:48:36,332 --> 00:48:40,294
"你的出场暗示我们该走了"
Your appearance on the scene was the signal for flight.

632
00:48:40,378 --> 00:48:45,633
"我们无法和你作对"
You are too formidable an antagonist.

633
00:48:50,012 --> 00:48:53,641
"等你明天来时 就会发现房子空了"
You will find the nest empty when you call tomorrow.

634
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:59,939
"至于那张照片 你的委托人尽管放心"
As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace.

635
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:07,238
"我爱一位比他强的人 他也爱我"
I love and am loved by a better man than he. "

636
00:49:10,867 --> 00:49:14,620
"国王可以"
"The King may"-

637
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:23,754
"国王可以随心所欲"
"The King may do what he will

638
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,509
"不必顾虑他所辜负的人会妨碍他"
without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.

639
00:49:28,634 --> 00:49:31,304
"我保留照片只为了自卫"
I kept it only to safeguard myself,

640
00:49:31,387 --> 00:49:34,974
"留下一件武器 永远保护我"
and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me

641
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,478
"不受他任何迫害"
from any steps he may take. "

642
00:49:56,621 --> 00:49:58,623
还有
There is more.

643
00:49:58,706 --> 00:50:03,836
"我留给他一张他可能愿意收下的照片"
"I leave another photograph which he might care to possess;

644
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,796
"亲爱的福尔摩斯先生 我仍然"
and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

645
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:12,845
"诚心向您致意 艾琳诺顿 原名艾德勒"
very truly yours, Irena Norton, nee Adler. "

646
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:18,851
多伟大的女人
What a woman!

647
00:50:18,976 --> 00:50:23,773
她会成为多伟大的皇后
What a queen she would have made!

648
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:28,444
真可惜她和我不在一个水平
Is it not a pity she was not on my level.

649
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,198
就我所见
From what I have seen of the lady,

650
00:50:32,281 --> 00:50:35,868
她的水平的确和陛下很不一样
yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your Majesty.

651
00:50:35,952 --> 00:50:40,581
我很遗憾没能完成使命
I am only so sorry that I have failed in my commission.

652
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:42,416
恰恰相反 亲爱的先生
On the contrary, my dear sir,

653
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,169
这已经很成功了
nothing could be more successful.

654
00:50:45,253 --> 00:50:47,839
我知道她言而有信
I know that her word is inviolate.

655
00:50:47,922 --> 00:50:51,551
那张照片现在和被烧了一样安全
The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.

656
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:54,095
我很高兴陛下这么认为
I am glad that your Majesty thinks so.

657
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,429
我对你感恩不尽
I am immensely indebted to you.

658
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:59,684
请告诉我怎样酬答你才好
Pray, tell me in what way I can reward you.

659
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,354
这个戒指?
This ring?

660
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:10,528
陛下有件东西
Your Majesty has something

661
00:51:10,611 --> 00:51:13,156
我认为更有价值
which I should value even more highly.

662
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:18,202
只要你开口
You have but to name it.

663
00:51:18,327 --> 00:51:20,580
这个
This.

664
00:51:20,663 --> 00:51:22,623
艾琳的照片?
Irena's photograph?

665
00:51:22,748 --> 00:51:25,793
当然 如果你愿意
Certainly, if you wish it.

666
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:26,627
那我谨祝
Then I have the honor

667
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:30,673
陛下您早安
to wish your Majesty a very good morning.

668
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:41,767
这就是一大丑闻
And that was how a great scandal

669
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:44,520
如何威胁着波希米亚王国
threatened the Kingdom of Bohemia,

670
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:47,940
而福尔摩斯的杰出计划
and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes

671
00:51:48,024 --> 00:51:51,861
怎样被一个女人的才智所挫败
were beaten by a woman's wit.

672
00:51:51,986 --> 00:51:54,447
他过去常常嘲笑女人的智力
He used to sneer much at the cleverness of women,

673
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:57,074
近来再没有听到了
but I have not heard him do it of late.

674
00:51:57,158 --> 00:51:59,994
而当他谈论艾琳艾德勒
And when he speaks of Irena Adler,

675
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,537
或者提到她时
or when he refers to that woman,

676
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:07,710
总是尊称她为"那位女人"
it is always under the honorable title of "the woman. "

677
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:11,839
在他眼里 她超越了她的性别
In his eyes, she eclipses the whole of her sex.

678
00:52:11,964 --> 00:52:14,550
他从未流露出任何
It was not that he ever betrayed any sign of love

679
00:52:14,675 --> 00:52:16,135
对艾琳的爱慕
for Irena Adler,

680
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,179
所有诸如那样的情感
all emotions such as that one

681
00:52:18,304 --> 00:52:22,266
都与他冷酷精密的头脑不符
are abhorrent to his cold, precise mind.

682
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:25,770
他只以病理的眼光看女人
He only looks on women pathologically,

683
00:52:25,853 --> 00:52:28,981
把她们看作动机 线索
as the source of motives, clues.

684
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:36,739
然而 他留下她的照片 锁起来
And yet, he keeps her photograph apart, locked up.

685
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:40,535
对他 世上只有一位女人
There is but one woman to him,

686
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:49,794
美丽的艾琳艾德勒 留在模糊朦胧的记忆中
the beautiful Irena Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

687
