我想如果对于您来说都是一样的话

146
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,060
我还是更愿意叫你大臣 大臣
I would prefer to call you Minister, Minister.

147
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,381
大臣 大臣?

我可不会这么说
I wouldn't say that.

159
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,300
你问了所有我不希望任何人问的问题
You came up with all the questions I hope nobody would ask.

160
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,426
反对党就是要提问的
Opposition's about asking questions.

161
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,660
执政党就是要避而不答
And Government's about not answering them.

162
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,900
不管怎样 你回答了我所有的问题
You answered all mine, anyway.

163

伍列是你的首席私人秘书

168
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,227
而我也有一个首席私人秘书

而他是常任秘书的首席私人秘书

首相会给你指定两个议会私人秘书

175
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,389
然后你会指定你自己的议会私人秘书
and you will appoint your own Parliamentary Private Secretary.

176
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,588
他们都是打字的?
Can they all type?

177
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,349
我们都不打字 大臣
None of us can type, Minister.

178
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,989
麦肯夫人打字
Mrs. McKay types.

179
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,341
她是秘书
She is the Secretary.

180

真可惜 我们都能开个代理处了
Pity we could have opened an agency.

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,380
非常幽默 先生        是的 非常非常有趣
Very droll, sir.    Yes, very very amusing.

182
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,906
我想他们都这么说          当然不是 大臣
I suppose they all say that.    Certainly not, Minister.

183
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,822
并不是这样
Not quite all.

184
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,260
对 现在该谈正事了
Right, now then, to business.

185
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,630
如果我太直率了 请你们原谅
You have to forgive me if I'm a bit blunt,

186
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,626
不过我就是这种人...
but that's the sort of chap I am...

187
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,588
看起来 这个部...
Frankly, this depart...

188
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,388
这个椅子有点...
This chair's a bit...

189
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,427
我们可以换一个 大臣      能吗?
We can change it, Minister.

190
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,821
我们可以换任何东西 大臣

家具 装饰品 办公惯例...
The furniture, decor, office routine...

192
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,902
悉听尊便        那我想要一个新椅子
Your wish is our command.     I'd like a new chair.

193
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,264
我讨厌旋转椅
I hate swivel chairs.

194
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,922
人们的确说有两种椅子
They do say that there are two kinds of chairs

195
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,422
就有两种对应的大臣
to go with the two kinds of Minister.

196
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,262
一种卷起铺盖就走人
One sort folds up instantly,

197
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,342
另一种原地转圈
the othersort goes round and round in circles.

198
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,388
好了 先生们 看来这个部门必须
Now, frankly this Department has got to cut

199
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,099
冲破紧绑的白厅官僚体制的束缚
a great swathe through all this stuffy Whitehall bureaucracy.

200
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,704
我们要打开窗子
We're going to throw open the windows,

201
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,750
换些新鲜空气 免去所有的繁文缛节
let in a bit of fresh air, cut through all the red tape,

202
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,344
让这台嘎吱作响的旧官僚机器重焕活力
streamline this creaking old bureaucratic machine.

203
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,944
你是说一个大扫除?        就是一个大扫除
You mean a clean sweep?      A clean sweep.

204
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,420
太多的人就只是坐在桌子后面
Far too many people just sitting behind desks.

205
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,189
当然不是像我们这样了
Not like us, of course.

206
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,989
不过我们必须清除给彼此制造工作的人了
But we've got to get rid of all those people just making work for each other.

207
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,664
清除掉?        我想您是说重新部署他们?
Get rid of them?     I think you mean "Redeploy them".

208
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,106
是的 哦上帝 不 我不是说让他们下岗
Yes. Good Lord no, I don't mean put them out of work.

209
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,023
透明政府 是我的政党的信条
Open Government, that's what my party believes in,

210
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,226
是我们宣言的主要纲领
that was the main plank of our manifesto.

211
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,779
让我们充分相信国家
Taking the nation into our confidence.

212
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,147
是不是让你耳目一新? 请坐      可以吗?
Now how does that strike you? Do sit down.

213
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,222
事实上 就像您去年5月2号在下院
In fact, Just as you said in the House on May 2nd last year,

214
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,982
然后是11月23号
and again on November 23rd,

215
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,823
然后在"观察者"和"每日邮报"
and in The Observer and in The Daily Mail,

216
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,140
和您的政党宣言所说的那样
and as your manifesto made clear.

217
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,823
这你都知道?
You know about that?

218
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,550
请看看这些提案 大臣
Please, have a look at these proposals Minister.

219
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,827
这些是使这个政策生效的大体规划
These are the ways to implement this policy

220
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,868
和一个起草好的白皮书 等您批示
and proposals for a white paper for your approval.

221
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,908
那张白皮书就可以叫做"透明政府"
The white paper might be called "Open Government".

222
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,505
你是说一切都...        都处理好了 大臣
You mean it's all been...     Taken care of, Minister.

223
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,902
谁做的这些?      那台嘎吱作响的旧官僚机器
Who did all this?      The old bureaucratic machine.

224
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,662
不 是说真的
No, quite seriously.

225
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,030
我们深切体会到了改革的必要性
We are fully seized of the need for reform.

226
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,626
而且我们已经提出这个议题了       我真的很惊讶
And we have taken it on board.     I'm rather surprised.

227
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,543
我还以为需要不停的说服你们呢
I expected to have to fight you all the way along the line with this.

228
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,019
人们对于公务员的确是有一些有趣的看法
People do have funny ideas about the Civil Service.

229
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,023
我们只是来帮助执行您的政策的
We're just here to implement your policies.

230
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,421
"缩短申请上诉手续的提案"?

"反对党狂笑 政府爆发出羞愧的呼号"

237
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,163

238
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,863
的确如此 大臣
Quite so, Minister.

请您过目下周的行程表 大臣

我的行程表? 你又不知道我会来
My diary? You didn't know I was coming.

243
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,462
你甚至都不知道谁会赢得选举
You didn't even know who'd win the election.

244
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,606
我们知道会有一个大臣 大臣

我的政党有四个委员会需要我参加
I'm on four policy committees for the party for a start.

262

我相信您不会让党派凌驾国家之上吧 大臣
I'm sure you won't want to be putting party before country, minister.

263
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,663

不过我恐怕...这轮不到我去评论
but I fear... well, it's not for me to criticise...

268
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,866
这是什么意思?       听起来很刺耳
What do you mean?     It's a harsh thing to say.

269
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,785
不过有些档案盒带着未完成的工作又回来了

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,067
让我把这些提案草案放进去
If I could just put in these draft proposals.

281
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,722
然后给 这是您的钥匙 大臣
And here, this is yourkey, Minister.

282
00:14:12,722 --> 00:14:14,267
走开 我已经受够了
Out of my way. I've had enough of this.

283
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,500
你不能进去       那你就拦我试试看
You can't go in there.    Just try and stop me.

284
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,548
吉姆 这到底是怎么回事?     弗兰克 你去哪了?
Jim, what's going on?     Frank, where've you been?

285
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,410
被关在等待室里
Stuck in the waiting room.

286
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,630
对不起 我们正在和大臣进行私人会议
Do you mind? We are in a private conference with the minister.

287
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,547
那我也应该在这里        冷静些 弗兰克
Then I should be here, too.     Calm down, Frank.

288
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,259
汉弗莱 弗兰克在这个部门必须有一个自己的办公室
Humphrey, Frank has got to have an office of his own in the department.

289
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,261
当然了 如果您坚持的话       我坚持
Certainly, if you insist.     I do insist.

290
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,060
我相信我们在沃森斯道(偏远地区)还有些空办公室
I do think we have some spare office space in Walthamstow.

291
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,506
沃森斯道?       是啊 真让人惊喜
Walthamstow?     Yes, it's surprising.

292
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,547
政府在伦敦到处都有地产
The Government owns property all over London.

293
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,783
我不想在沃森斯道          那是个不错的地区
I don't want to be in Walthamstow.     It's in a very nice part.

294
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,622
据我所知 沃森斯道是个很棒的地方
Walthamstow's a very nice place so I gather.

295
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,701
我需要在这个楼里有个办公室      为什么?
I need an office here in this building.    Why's that?

296
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,508
是的 我同意弗兰克
Yes, I agree with Frank.

297
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,862
好吧 伯纳 我们得在这给威瑟尔先生找间办公室
Bernard, we must find an office here for Mr. Weasel.

298
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,383
埃瑟尔
Wiesel.

299
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,623
所有给我的文件都要给弗兰克复印一份
Copies of all the papers that come to me go to Frank.

300
00:15:02,623 --> 00:15:03,590
所有的?     所有的
All?      All.

301
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,422
没问题
It shall be done.

302
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,979
所有适当的文件
All the appropriate papers.

303
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,420
你的新大臣怎么样 汉弗莱?
How's your new Minister, Humphrey?

304
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,899
以一个新人来说学得的很快
Learning the rules very quickly for a newboy.

305
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,265
你的新内阁怎么样?       没问题
How's your new Cabinet?     No problem.

306
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,500
很难找出和上一届有什么不同
It's hard to tell the differece with the last one.

307
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,145
阿诺德 我听说最近美国的大使
Arnold, I hear the American Ambassador's been spending

308
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,460
经常和首相在一起
a lot of time with the PM.

309
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,782
是的       国防还是经贸?
Yes.     Defence or trade?

310
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:36,665
两者都有
Both.

311
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,786
那个航天系统的合同?
The aerospace systems contract?

312
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,101
暂时别让内阁听到
Ssh. Don't want the cabinet to hear about it yet.

313
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,783
这个 航空的东西对于首相来讲
This aerospace thingumy would be

314
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:48,705
应该算是一个妙举 是吗?
rather a coup for the PM, wouldn't it?

315
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,600
是的 已经做了好几周 现在新首相可以居功了
Yes, now the new PM will take the credit.

316
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,505
很抱歉打扰了 阿诺德爵士 汉弗莱爵士
Sorry to intrude SirArnold, Sir Humphrey,

317
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:57,600
请您过目一下大臣的讲话稿
if you could just OK the Minister's speech,

318
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,670
我就可以把它给议会了
I can get it straight to the House.

319
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,359
好的 当然可以 想加入我们吗?
Yes, of course. Like to join us?

320
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:05,745
哦 谢谢 汉弗莱先生 不过我现在很忙
Oh, thank you, Sir Humphrey, so long as I'm not too long.

321
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,901
给你自己弄杯咖啡吧
Get yourself a cup of coffee.

322
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,862
那么首相就会很尴尬了
So it would be rather an embarrassment to the PM,

323
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,023
不是吗? 假设有某个大臣
wouldn't it? if a hypothetical Minister were to rock

324
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,181
想要掀翻英美关系的船?
the Anglo American boat?

325
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,942
严重的尴尬
Grave embarrassment.

326
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,259
有多严重?
How grave?

327
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,705
我想会是人仰马翻
Man overboard, I should think.

328
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,762
足够缩短一个前途美好的大臣的职业生涯了?
Enough to cut short a promising new Ministerial career?

329
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,222
没有问题
No question.

330
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,148
坐下吧 伯纳
Pull up a chair, Bernard...

331
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,264
说一说你对我们的新大臣的看法
And tell us what you think of our new Minister.

332
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,982
非常不错
Well absolutely fine.

333
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:50,428
是的 我们会马上就培训好他的
Yes, we'll have him housetrained in no time.

334
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,927
他把整个日程都囫囵吞下了
He swallowed the whole diary,

335
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:56,268
我想他上周废寝忘食的完成所有的档案盒了?
and I gatherhe did his boxes like a lamb lastweekend?

336
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:57,065
是的 他都完成了
Yes. Yes he did.

337
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,069
我们必须让他忘掉透明政府这种瞎话
We must head him off this Open Government nonsense.

338
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,182
我以为那白皮书的名字就是"透明政府"
I thought we were calling the White Paper "Open Government".

339
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,222
是 我们总把难的部分放到题目里
Always dispose of the difficult bit in the title.

340
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,820
放那里比放到文章里要无害多了
Does less harm there than in the text.

341
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,799
你越不想做什么事情
The less you intend to do about something,

342
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,761
就越应该不断地说这件事
the more you have to keep talking about it.

343
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:16,119
不过 "透明政府"有什么不对吗?
What's wrong with open government?

344
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,441
为什么公众不能对政府进程知道的更详细些?
Why shouldn't the public know more about what's going on?

345
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,547
你当真吗?
Are you serious?

346
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,658
是啊 我是说 这毕竟是大臣的政策
Well, yes, I mean it's the Minister's policy, afterall.

347
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,060
这个短语本来就互相矛盾
It's a contradiction in terms.

348
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,599
你可以透明 或者你可以有个政府
You can be open or you can have government.

349
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,200
不过 民主政府的公民们当然有了解的权利
But surely the citizens of a democracy have a right to know.

350
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,460
不 他们有无知的权利
No. They have a right to be ignorant.

351
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,526
了解会带来同谋感和罪恶感
Knowledge only means complicity and guilt.

352
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,226
无知倒能保持尊严
Ignorance has a certain dignity.

353
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,182
不过如果大臣想要这个"透明政府"
But if the Minister wants...

354
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,820
你不能只是让人得其所愿
You don't just give people what they want,

355
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,442
要是这对他们并无好处的话
if it's not good for them.

356
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:54,063
你会给一个酒鬼白兰地吗?
Do you give brandy to an alcoholic?

357
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,598
如果人们不知道你在干什么
If people don't know what you are doing,

358
00:17:56,598 --> 00:17:58,146
他们就不知道你做错了什么
they don't know what you are doing wrong.

359
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,464
抱歉 汉弗莱爵士 我是大臣的私人秘书 如果他想...
I am the Minister's Private Secretary, and if he wants...

360
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,703
亲爱的朋友 你总不能帮着大臣丢人现眼吧
You must not help him to make a fool of himself.

361
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,967
看看我们以往的那些大臣
Look at the Ministers we've had.

362
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,970
要不是他们严格对工作进程秘密
Everyone of them would have been a laughing stock in three month

363
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,381
不用三个月就成了别人的笑柄了
had it not been for the most rigid secrecy about what they were up to.

364
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,986
那您有什么建议呢?
What do you propose to do?

365
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,979
你能保守秘密吗?       当然了
Can you keep a secret?     Of course.

366
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,948
我也能
So can I.

367
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,623
请原谅 我得去打个电话
Excuse me, I have to make a phone call.

368
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,748
我最好把这个还给大臣了
Well, I'd betterbe getting this back to the Minister.

369
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,820
马丁 威瑟尔(黄鼠狼)有没有拿到
Martin. Has the weasel had a copy of the invoice

370
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,345
新的美国寻址机器的发票复印件?
for the new American addressing machines?

371
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,705
我以为您说那个是机密
I thought you said it was sensitive.

372
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,145
的确是 今天给他看吧
So it is. Get it to him today.

373
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,338
对了 马丁 让他在一摞文件的底部看到它
Oh, and Martin, let him find it near the bottom of the pile.

374
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,144
吉姆 吉姆
Jim, Jim.

375
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,141
怎么了        看看我找到了什么
Yes.     Look what I've found.

376
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,780
我们这次可抓到他们的小辫子了       你说什么呢?
We've got them by the short and curlies. What're you talking about?

377
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,544
该死的汉弗莱・阿普比先生
We've got Sir Humphrey Bloody Appleby

378
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,160
和那个鼻孔朝天的私人秘书伍列先生
and Mr. Toffee Nosed Snooty Wolley

379
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,498
都被我们抓了个正着 看这个
just where we want them. See this?

380
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,100
这张看起来很无辜的纸
This innocent-looking piece of paper.

381
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,247
这个政治炸药
Political dynamite.

382
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,870
冷静点 弗兰克 我都不明白你在说什么
Calm down. What are you talking about?

383
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:32,386
这是一千台监控显示设备终端机的发票
This is an invoice for 1.000 computervideo display terminals.

384
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,028
每个一万英镑 也就是总共一千万英镑
At 10.000 pounds each, that is, ten milion pounds.

385
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,503
然后呢?
So?

386
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,268
是匹兹堡制造公司生产的
Made by the Pittsburgh Manufacturing Corporation Inc.,

387
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,149
从美国进口的?       是啊
Imported from America?     I know.

388
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,870
但是我们自己也制造电脑外围设备
But we make computer peripherals in this country.

389
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,498
就在我自己的选区啊        就是啊
In my constituency.     I know!

390
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,985
失业问题怎么办?          就是啊
What about unemployment?     I know!

391
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:56,667
我必须阻止它
This must be stopped.

392
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,027
汉弗莱爵士想...哦 对不起       哦 不不 进来
Sir Humphrey to see... oh sorry.     Oh no. No, come in.

393
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:05,306
我正想见你们两个 快进来
I want to see you both, come on.

394
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,108
汉弗莱爵士 请坐
Sir Humphrey, take a seat.

395
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,589
谢谢 大臣
Thank you, Minister.

396
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,504
弗兰克刚刚发现这个关于
Now then, Frank here has just discovered this contract

397
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,423
从美国那里购入价值一千万英镑的
for the import of ten million pound's worth

398
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,899
显示器终端的合同
of video display terminals, from America.

399
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,662
我能看一下吗?
May I see?

400
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,841
哦 是的  给白厅全体公务员的
Oh yes. For the whole Civil Service in Whitehall.

401
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,884
不过这些东西不是英国货        很不幸 是的
But they're not British.     That is unfortunately true.

402
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,788
我们的国家也生产这些东西        不是同样的质量
We make these machines in this country.      Not of the same quality.

403
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,623
更好的质量 就在我的选区
Better quality. In my constituency.

404
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,979
有人建议我们...        汉弗莱 这个合同必须阻止
We were advised...      This contract must be stopped.

405
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,268
这不在我的权力之内了 大臣 只有财政部才能取消
It's beyond my power, Minister. This can only be cancelled by the Treasury.

406
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,465
为什么?
Why's that?

407
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,667
公务员系统取消合同有了一个
Would be a major policy change for the Civil Service

408
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,027
重要的政策改变 尤其是海外的合同
to cancel contracts, especially with overseas suppliers.

409
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,062
也许您想和内阁提一下这件事情
If you'd like to take it up with the Cabinet.

410
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,749
我该怎么面对我的选区?
How am I to face my constituency party?

411
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,221
何必让他们知道?
Why need they know?

412
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,665
何必让任何人知道?
Why need anybody know?

413
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,820
我们可以让它永远保密
We can see that it never gets out.

414
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,584
透明政府        对啊 透明政府
Open Government.     That's right.Open Government.

415
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,042
如果这个合同不能被取消 那它就应该被公开
If the order can't be cancelled, it must be published.

416
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,242
正确 应该公开它
That's right. It must be published.

417
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,898
为什么?
Why?

418
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,586
为什么 弗兰克?         宣言
Why, Frank?     The manifesto.

419
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,550
而且会让你的前任看起来像个叛徒
Also it will make your predecessor look like a traitor.

420
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,541
对 两个无法忽视的原因       这事不能讨价还价
Two unanswerable reasons.     You didn't bargain for this!

421
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,302
你不会是在建议让
You're not suggesting

422
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,099
大臣在讲话里正面提及
that the Minister should make a positive reference

423
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,660
这个机密交易吧?
to this confidential transaction in a speech?

424
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,988
讲话 就是这个
Speech. That's it.

425
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:38,507
吉姆 那个国家公众雇主工会的讲话如何?
Jim, what about the speech to the Union of office Employees?

426
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,468
对 弗兰克 我会告诉他们这个可耻的合同
I'll tell them about this scandalous contract.

427
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,461
而且我们今天就发布给媒体
And we'll release it to the press today.

428
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,621
现在是谁在治理国家了?         啊...是的
Who's running the country now?     Well... yes.

429
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,946
你反对?         如果我们惹恼美国人的话
You object?      It might be regrettable,

430
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,788
也许事情会很难办         美国人?
if we upset the Americans.      The Americans.

431
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,703
他们该丢掉那种狂妄的经济态度了
It's time they lose their commercial complacency.

432
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,624
我们必须关心英国的穷人 不是美国的富人        对
We must think of the British poor, not the American rich!     Right

433
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,700
大臣 如果那是您的明确指示
If that is your express wish,

434
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,908
整个部门都会支持你的 全力以赴
the Departmentwill back you,up to the hilt.

435
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,589
那是我的明确指示
That is my express wish.

436
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,650
我最好把讲稿给有关部门请求通过
I'd better circulate the speech to the relevant department for clearance.

437
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,060
通过? 和别的部门又没关系
Clearance? It got nothing to do with other department.

438
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,887
可是 透明政府当然要求我们和同事
Open Government demands that we should include our colleagues,

439
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:17,005
以及媒体的朋友们通力合作吧
as well as our friends in Fleet Street.

440
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,823
哦是的 的确是这样         我可不确定
Oh yes, that's fair enough.     I'm not sure.

441
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,185
谢谢你们 还有 汉弗莱...
Thank you. And Humphrey...

442
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:24,739
要把它直接交给媒体
See that goes straight to the press.

443
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,269
我们会全力履行您的要求
We shall serve your best interests.

444
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,225
谢谢
Thank you.

445
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,703
那么...
Now then...

446
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,462
我看看
Let me see.

447
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,564
透明政府
Open Government.

448
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:42,064
我们保证人们 会给他们一个透明政府
As you know, We've made a pledge to the people about open government.

449
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,107
那就开始吧
So let's have some.

450
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:48,501
我了解到就在上个月 上一届政府
I have discovered that only last month, the previous government

451
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,345
签了一份一千万英镑的进口合同
signed a contract to import 10,000 pounds of office equipment

452
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,263
用于公务员的办公室用品...        官僚
to used by the Civil Service...   Bureaucracy!

453
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,019
提供给公务员官僚的用品
Used by the Civil Service bureaucracy.

454
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:00,539
所以 我们被美国匹兹堡聪明的
So, we are being fobbed off with second rate American junk

455
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,463
推销员用二等货给欺骗了
by smart Aleck salesmen from Pittsburgh

456
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,064
而英国的工厂却歇业
while British factories stand empty

457
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,263
英国的工人排着长队领施舍品
and British workmen queue up for the dole.

458
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:12,939
失业救济金          施舍品 伯纳
Unemployment benefit.    The dole, Bernard.

459
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,787
尽管我对我们大洋彼岸了不起的表弟
"Much as I personally value the friendship of our great cousins

460
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,906
充满了敬意...
from across the sea".

461
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,980
打扰一下 大臣 有点事情        什么事?
Excuse me Minister, something's come up.    Yes?

462
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:35,710
首相办公室的备忘录         我很忙
A minute from the PM's Office.    I'm pretty busy.

463
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,304
我想您必须看一下 大臣        那上面写了些什么?
I do think you ought to read this, Minister. What does it say?

464
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,382
首相打算下个月访问华盛顿
The PM is planning a visit to Washington next month

465
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,623
讨论一个价值不菲的英美安防贸易合约
for a valuable Anglo American defence trade agreement.

466
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,429
其重要性不可小觑
Its importance cannot be overestimated.

467
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,979
好...天哪 我的讲稿给媒体了吗?
Fine. God Has my speech gone to the press?

468
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,266
我想是的 按照您的要求
I presume so, as you requested.

469
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,305
很抱歉 大臣 不过首相府已经乱套了
I'm sorry, but all hell's just broken loose at Number Ten.

470
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,303
他们刚看到您的讲稿 问为什么未经审查
They're asking why your speech didn't obtain clearance.

471
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,030
你怎么回答的?        我说我们相信透明政府
What did you say?     I said we believed in open government.

472
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,579
不过看起来只让事情变的更糟
But it seemed to make things worse.

473
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,708
首相要您去下院见他 马上
The PM wants to see you in the House, right away.

474
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,701
会发生什么?
What's going to happen?

475
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,121
"首相能予之 首相亦能取之"
The Prime Minister giveth and the Prime Minister taketh away.

476
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:34,142
"愿首相保佑我们大家"
Blessed be the name of the Prime Minister.

476
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,842
(首相办公室)
PRIME MINISTER

477
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,224
你好 维克...
Hello, Vic...

478
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,984
汉弗莱・阿普比先生  维克・果德 总组织秘书
Sir Humphrey Appleby, Vic Gould, our ChiefWhip.

479
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,948
你真会惹麻烦啊 是吗?
You really are a pain in the ass, aren't you?

480
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,347
首相都快跳墙了
The PM's going up the wall.

481
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,738
以头抢地了
Hitting the roof.

482
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,549
你不能随便发表那样的演讲
You can't go around making speeches like that.

483
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,508
这是个透明政府
It's Open Government.

484
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,104
闭嘴 威瑟尔 谁问你         埃瑟尔
Shut up, Weasel.     Wiesel!

485
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,421
对呀 透明政府是我们宣言的主要纲领
But Open Government was the main plank in our manifesto.

486
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,866
首相也这么想         透明又不是裂个大洞
The PM believes in it too.     Open, yes. But not gaping.

487
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,989
搞政治就要学会怎样机智的说话 白痴
In politics you have to learn say things with tact, you berk!

488
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,901
还有什么时候不应该说话
And when to say nothing at all.

489
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,823
你当大臣多长时间了?        一周半了
How long have you been a Minister?     Week and half.

490
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,706
也许你能进吉尼斯纪录了
I think You may find a place in the Guinness book of records.

491
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,667
我已经能看到标题了
I can see the headlines already.

492
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,821
"内阁在美国贸易问题上产生分歧"
"Cabinet split on U. S. Trade.

493
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,584
"哈克发起对首相的叛变"
Hacker leads revolt against Prime Minister.

494
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,706
这就是你想要的 是不是?
That's what you want, is it?

495
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,901
阿诺德爵士 有什么新消息吗?
Ah, Sir Arnold, what news?

496
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:47,630
那个演讲让首相很焦虑
That speech is causing the PM some distress.

497
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,826
它确实已经捅到媒体那里了吗?
Has it definitely been released to the Press?

498
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,778
大臣的直接指令是中午
Well, the Minister gave express instructions for noon.

499
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,384
不是吗?        你真让我震惊 汉弗莱
Isn't that right?     I'm appalled at you, Humphrey.

500
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,702
你怎么能让大臣绕过必经渠道
How could you let the Minister put himself in this position

501
00:25:58,702 --> 00:26:00,702
就发布这种信息?
without gonig to the public channel?

502
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,826
我们相信透明政府
We believe in open government.

503
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,990
我们想打开窗户 透进一些新鲜空气
We want to open the windows and let in a bit of fresh air.

504
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,824
不是吗 大臣?
Isn't that right, Minister?

505
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,469
大臣 这对政党是个好口号
It's good party stuff,

506
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,986
但是这让首相很难堪
but it puts the PM in a very difficult situation.

507
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,027
那我们对透明政府做出的承诺呢?
What about our commitment to Open Government?

508
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,059
看起来这已经是透明政府的最后一季了
This seems to be the closed season for open government.

509
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,422
您要不要考虑一下
Do you want to give thought

510
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,104
写辞呈的草稿?
to a draft letter of resignation?

511
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,498
以防万一...
Just in case...

512
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,820
我们不能把它遮掩过去吗?
Can't we hush it up?

513
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,421
遮掩?        是的 遮掩过去
Hush it up?     Yes, hush it up.

514
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,981
您是说...把消息压下去?
You mean... suppress it?

515
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,703
是的 就这个意思
Yes, I suppose I do.

516
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,260
懂了 您是说在您安排的
You mean that within the framework of the guidelines

517
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,547
透明政府的总体框架内
about open goverment that you have laid down,

518
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:50,986
您建议我们采用更灵活的态度?
you're suggesting we should adopt a more flexible posture?

519
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,345
我是这个意思吗? 哦 对对
Am I? Oh yes. Yes.

520
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,546
大臣 关于媒体发布
Minister about the press release...

521
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,783
我们似乎还有
There appears to be a development

522
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,783
回转的余地
could precipitate a reappraisal of our position.

523
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,704
我们忘了各部间的审查过程
We forgot the interdepartmental clearance procedure.

524
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,262
附加阻止令起效用了
The supplementary stop order came into effect.

525
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,106
真的?      没事了 大臣 您的讲稿还没捅给媒体
So, your speech hasn't gone to the Press.

526
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,104
它只捅到了首相的私人办公室
It's only gone to the PM's Private Office

527
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,058
而没有首相和外交部的指示
and the Duty Officer had no instructions to pass it out

528
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,869
执行官员无权把它公布        不过为什么呢?
without clearance of the PM and the foreign office.      But how come?

529
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,504
这全都是我的错 大臣
The fault is entirely mine, Minister.

530
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,426
这个阻止公布讲稿的程序是在
The procedure of the holding up of press releases dates back to

531
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,546
确立透明政府之前的事情了
before open government,

532
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,622
我不知为什么 忘了废除它了
and I unaccountably omitted to rescind it.

533
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:39,262
希望您原谅我的过失        哦 当然了
I hope you forgive this lapse.     Well, yes, of course.

534
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,102
没问题 汉弗莱 没问题        谢谢 大臣
That's quite all right.    Thank you, Minister.

535
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,420
毕竟 我们都会犯错误的
Afterall, we all make mistakes.

536
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,543
是 大臣
Yes, Minister.
