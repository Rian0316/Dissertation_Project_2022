1
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,874
嘿 你父母那事怎么样了?
Hey, how are things going with your parents?

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,676
不好 他们雇了离婚律师
Not great. They hired divorce attorneys.

3
00:00:07,678 --> 00:00:09,378
要知道 说起律师
You know, speaking of attorneys,

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,647
如果我要请律师
if I ever needed a lawyer,

5
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:14,950
绝不会请个女浩克
I would not hire She-Hulk.

6
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:17,786
知道吗? 你这话就差一点没离题
You know what? That was almost on topic.

7
00:00:17,788 --> 00:00:20,289
我得说 "干得好 Sheldon"
I'm gonna say, "Good job, Sheldon."

8
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:23,292
等等 女浩克是个律师?
Wait, She-Hulk's a lawyer?

9
00:00:23,294 --> 00:00:25,127
对 她在纽约的一家律师事务所工作
Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York.

10
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:28,397
没错 但她是里头唯一的怪物
Yes, but she's the only monster at the firm.

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,299
我偷偷告诉你们
Between you, me and the wall,

12
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:33,736
我觉得事务所是响应平权法案才雇她的
I think she's an Affirmative Action hire.

13
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,939
反正我爸爸要来
Anyway, Dad's gonna be here in town,

14
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:39,475
所以今年我没法做圣诞晚餐了
so I won't be able to do Christmas dinner this year.

15
00:00:39,477 --> 00:00:41,477
如果你没法做圣诞晚餐
If you're not up to hosting Christmas dinner,

16
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,711
我很愿意接手
I'm happy to do it.

17
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,279
你可以把你爸爸带来
You can even bring your father.

18
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:46,048
那很不错
That would be nice.

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,182
我一直很想办一个
I've always wanted to do

20
00:00:47,184 --> 00:00:48,817
传统维多利亚式的圣诞晚会
a traditional Victorian Christmas.

21
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,820
玩室内游戏 享受烤鹅和无花果布丁...
Parlor games, goose and figgy pudding...

22
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,490
恶心!
Ugh!

23
00:00:54,492 --> 00:00:56,024
英式布丁
English pudding.

24
00:00:56,026 --> 00:00:57,793
你... 心心念念想吃布丁
Y... You get yourself all excited for pudding,

25
00:00:57,795 --> 00:01:00,829
结果一看是个葡萄干蛋糕
and here comes a cake with raisins in it.

26
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:02,598
我不去
I'm not going.

27
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,766
你必须去
You're going.

28
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,934
你干嘛恨我?
Why do you hate me?

29
00:01:05,936 --> 00:01:07,469
我不恨你
I don't hate you.

30
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,437
我爱你
I love you.

31
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,671
你说这是爱
Well, you call it love,

32
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,707
但其实里面还是一堆葡萄干
but it has a lot of raisins in it.

33
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:15,911
Amy 要想让这些家伙喜欢主题晚餐
Amy, good luck getting these guys excited

34
00:01:15,913 --> 00:01:17,312
我得祝你好运了
about a dinner with a theme.

35
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:20,949
当年没人理我的汤姆・汉克斯(感恩)节 我就放弃了
I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving.

36
00:01:17,314 --> 00:01:20,949
{\an8}汉克斯与感恩发音相似

37
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,154
我觉得维多利亚式的圣诞很不错
I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.

38
00:01:25,156 --> 00:01:25,888
- 我同意  - 挺好的
- I agree.  - Why not?

39
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,955
我也觉得不错
Me, too.

40
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,057
你们太坏了!
You guys suck!

41
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:32,661
* 宇宙一度又烫又稠密 *
* Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state *

42
00:01:32,663 --> 00:01:35,998

* Then nearly 14 billion years ago expansion started... Wait! * 

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,633

47
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:47,442
* 一切由大爆炸开始 *
* That all started with a big bang *

48
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,376

00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:03,004
你知道在超净间工作最棒的是什么吗?
You know the best part of working in the clean room?

53
00:02:03,006 --> 00:02:04,039
没有过敏原
No allergies.

54
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,340
看我的
Check it out.

55
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:09,511
一下... 一下吸太多氧气了
Oh, that... that... that's a lot of oxygen.

56
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:13,815
我们得出发去Amy家了
We should get going to Amy's.

57
00:02:13,817 --> 00:02:15,517
你能相信曾几何时
Can you believe there was a time

58
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,319
我们还需要一整排
when we would have needed an array

59
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:20,088
巨型切伦科夫望远镜来探测宇宙微粒吗?
of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles?

60
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,224
瞧瞧现在 我们在组装自己的多线制探测器
And here we are building our own multi-wire detector

61
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,194
就跟牛人一样
like a couple of badasses.

62
00:02:26,196 --> 00:02:28,196
我知道 如果我们还是单身
I know. If we were still single,

63
00:02:28,198 --> 00:02:31,466
就会迷失在万花丛中
we'd be tripping over all that booty.

64
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:35,503
妹子的确喜欢穿得像垃圾袋一样的男人
Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag.

65
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,411
不
Oh, no.

66
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,314
怎么会有一只鸽子飞进来?
How the hell did a pigeon get in here?

67
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,350
- 你关了装载门吧?  - 不是你关了吗
- You shut the loading doors, right?  - I thought you did.

68
00:02:48,352 --> 00:02:50,518
这简直是灾难啊你懂吗?!
Do you know what a disaster this is?!

69
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,021
你指的是 这房间不应该有任何灰尘
You mean 'cause this room isn't supposed to have dust in it,

70
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:55,991
结果飞进来了一只造粪机器这事?!
and we just let in a flying crap machine?!

71
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,827
我们该怎么办? 得给谁打电话?
What do we do? Should we call someone?

72
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,696
然后告诉他们我们糟蹋了所有的器材?
And tell them that we compromised all the equipment?

73
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,065
趁着没人知道 我们把它赶出去
Let's just get it out of here before anyone knows.

74
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:05,367
好 怎么抓它?
Okay, how do we catch it?

75
00:03:05,369 --> 00:03:07,769
如果我们关掉所有的灯
Well, what if we turn off all the lights

76
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,038
独留一盏 它就会飞过来
except for one, and it'll come to it.

77
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,907
它又不是蛾子!
It's not a moth!

78
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,276
别冲我大吼
Don't yell at me.

79
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,612
如果你大吼大叫的 我是不可能
You're not gonna get any good ideas out of me

80
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,680
想出好主意的
if you're yelling.

81
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,248
好吧 如果我保持冷静
Okay, so if I remain calm,

82
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,218
你就会再多想几个类似"关灯"的主意?!
I'll get more gems like, "Turn off the lights"?!

83
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,786
太好了 我们内讧了
Great, we're turning on each other.

84
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,055
那鸟就是想让我们内讧!
That's just what the bird wants us to do!

85
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:32,527
Koothrappali博士 飞了很久吧?
So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?

86
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:34,963
- 二十个小时  - 真辛苦
- 20 hours.  - Oh, that's rough.

87
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:38,066
一点都不辛苦 你知道横跨大陆飞行
Not at all. Did you know that when you fly transcontinental

88
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:41,436
老婆不在身边 就不用祈祷飞机坠毁的吧?
without your wife, you don't pray for the plane to crash?

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,107
你能不能说点别的事情?
Can you please talk about anything else?

90
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,376
抱歉
Forgive me.

91
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,577
你和Leonard怎么样?
How are you and Leonard?

92
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,479
很好 一切都很顺利
Oh, great. Everything's good.

93
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,015
- 我看你都订婚了  - 没错
- I see you got engaged.  - Yes, we did.

94
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:55,083
我来给你讲个故事
Let me tell you a story.

95
00:03:55,085 --> 00:03:56,618
老爸!
Dad!

96
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,653
抱歉
Sorry.

97
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:01,156
你们肯定不会慢慢讨厌对方的
I'm sure you won't grow to hate each other.

98
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,362
嘿 Leonard 怎么了?
Hey, Leonard. What's up?

99
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,432
什么? 怎么会出这种事?
What? How did that happen?

100
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,466
好 好
Yeah, okay.

101
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,268
我尽快赶过去
I'll be there as soon as I can.

102
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,470
抱歉 我得跑大学一趟
Sorry. I have to run to the university.

103
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,571
出什么事了?
What's going on?

104
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:19,374
我们的实验出问题了
There's been a problem with our experiment.

105
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:21,443
一只鸟飞进超净间了
A bird got into the clean room.

106
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,945
- 要我一起去吗?  - 呃 不了
- You want me to come?  - Uh, no.

107
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:26,214
您大老远飞来 先待在这里放松一下吧
You had a long flight. You stay here and relax.

108
00:04:26,216 --> 00:04:28,716
"放松一下" 你说得倒轻巧
"Relax." Easy for you to say.

109
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:31,052
你妈扫的可不是你的银行账号
Your mother isn't cleaning out your bank account.

110
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:35,490
40年了 那女人从没清扫过任何东西
40 years, the woman never cleaned a thing.

111
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:37,258
你就把他留在这儿了?
You're just gonna leave him here?

112
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,494
- "放松一下" 他说  - 对 拜拜
- "Relax," he says.  - Yup. Bye.

113
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:44,933
# 圣诞老人来啦 圣诞老人来啦 #
# Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus #

114
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:46,501
# 沿着圣诞大道来 #
# Right down Santa Claus Lane #

115
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,104
# 维克森和布利岑 和其他的驯鹿 #
# Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer #

116
00:04:49,106 --> 00:04:50,839
# 拉动着缰绳... #
# Pulling on the reins... #

117
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,006
好了 我很感谢你送我...
Yeah, I appreciate the ride...

118
00:04:52,008 --> 00:04:54,109
# 铃儿们在响 孩子们在唱 #
# Bells are ringing, children singing #

119
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:56,878
# 心情多愉快 #
# All is merry and bright #

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,247
# 快挂上你的袜子 说出你的祷词 #
# So hang your stockings and say your prayers #

121
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,484
# 圣诞老人今晚就来... #
# 'Cause Santa Claus is coming tonight... #

122
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,819
怎么关了?
Why'd you turn it off?

123
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:07,856
因为刚才的十分钟里 圣诞老人来了
Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town,

124
00:05:04,821 --> 00:05:11,860
{\an8}以下都是著名圣诞歌曲名

125
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:11,860
吻了老妈 然后驾着驯鹿撞翻了奶奶
kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer.

126
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,995
我有个喝醉的舅舅 也都干过这些
I had a drunk uncle who did all those things.

127
00:05:13,997 --> 00:05:16,264
却没人给他唱首歌
Nobody sings songs about him.

128
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:19,734
那这样吧 你把圣诞老人想象成一位超级英雄
Maybe you'd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero

129
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,403
能力就是给儿童带来欢乐
and his power is bringing joy to children.

130
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,173
这一点我舅舅也被控诉了
My uncle was accused of that, too.

131
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:28,209
结果发现这在俄克拉荷马州是合法的
It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma.

132
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:30,178
好吧 换个话题
Okay, new subject.

133
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,080
我们来聊聊礼物吧
Let's talk about presents.

134
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,748
你给Amy买了什么呀?
What did you get Amy?

135
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,283
哦 我们不会互换礼物的
Oh, we're not exchanging gifts.

136
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,486
行了 Sheldon 你总得给她买点什么
Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something.

137
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:39,988
为什么啊?
Why should I?

138
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,923
她知道我不喜欢圣诞节
She knows that I don't like Christmas,

139
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:44,859
但每年都还强迫我过圣诞节
and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it.

140
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,896
我不光要违背意愿参加傻气的晚餐
Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will.

141
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,298
在圣诞树那块儿 还有棵槲寄生
At the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe,

142
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,433
她竟然在树下公开吻我
and she kissed me under it in public.

143
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,433
 {\an8}(注: 槲寄生下接吻是圣诞传统)

144
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,703
弄得我们像是蒂花纳性表演里的明星似的
Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show.

145
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,641
她只是为节日感到兴奋嘛
She's just excited about the holidays.

146
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:03,711
是的 而且她毫不考虑我的感受
Yes, and she's not taking my feelings into account at all.

147
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:05,914
也许我该教训教训她了
Maybe it's time I teach her a lesson.

148
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,715
怎么教训?
How?

149
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:11,719
一定得是罪大恶极的
Hmm. It'd have to be something heinous,

150
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,923
要让她感受到和我一样的痛苦
something that makes her as miserable as she's making me.

151
00:06:14,925 --> 00:06:17,325
哦 我想到了
Oh, I've got it.

152
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,596
有戏看了
This is good.

153
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:22,764
什么?
What?

154
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,900
我要给她买个礼物
I'm going to buy her a present.

155
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:29,971
这个 我得需要一点解释了
Yeah, you're gonna have to walk me through that.

156
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,173
人们送礼时 是有暗示的社交约定的
With gift-giving, there's an implied social contract.

157
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,508
如果我今晚
If I show up

158
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,344
给她带去了礼物 但她拿不出一个给我
tonight with a present, and she doesn't have one for me,

159
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:38,980
她会感觉很难堪的
she'll feel terrible.

160
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,282
这样你俩就都难受了?
Then you're both sad?

161
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:43,518
是的
Yes.

162
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,886
说不定她会觉得如此内疚
Maybe she'll feel so guilty,

163
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,055
从此就不再和我过圣诞节了
she'll never make me celebrate the holidays again.

164
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:51,993
所以你的邪恶计划就是给你女友买个礼物喽?
So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?

165
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,528
正确
That's right.

166
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,598
所以对我好点 不然小心我也会给你买一个
So stay on my good side, or I'll get you a little something, too.

167
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,672
好了 计划是这样
Okay, here's the plan.

168
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,874
我把吃的放进袋子里
I'm gonna put the food in the bag,

169
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,078
当他飞到袋子里吃的时候 就扎上袋子
and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up.

170
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,280
牛肉棒?
A Slim Jim?

171
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:14,282
我能找到的就这 能成的
It's all I could find. It'll work.

172
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:15,416
当然了
Sure.

173
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,252
如果鸽子都是喝醉的或是卡车司机
If the pigeon's stoned or a trucker.

174
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:21,289
好吧 那你想怎样?
Okay, well, what's your plan?

175
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,490
我说过我的计划了
I told you my plan.

176
00:07:22,492 --> 00:07:24,158
把管理处叫过来帮忙
Let's call Building Services and get help.

177
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,528
然后承认我们污染了超净间?
And admit that we contaminated the clean room?

178
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,064
不 是承认你污染了超净间
No, admit that you contaminated the clean room.

179
00:07:30,066 --> 00:07:32,233
为啥你总说是我弄的?
Why do you keep assuming it was me?

180
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:34,469
因为你总是做出这种事
Because you do this kind of thing all the time,

181
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:36,371
然后总是想掩盖
and then you try to cover it up.

182
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,373
哪儿有过啊?
Like when?

183
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,808
你把火星车开翻车
What about when you flipped the Mars Rover,

184
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,477
弄丢了Koothrappali的狗
or lost Koothrappali's dog,

185
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,013
还差点带着婴儿开跑了算不?
or almost drove off with that baby?

186
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:48,716
我说过了 它跟我的车一个样 而且
Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didn't even cry

187
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,885
直到他妈拿钥匙打我了 那孩儿才开始哭
until his mother punched me with her keys.

188
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,521
好吧 把牛肉棒放进垃圾袋吧
Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag.

189
00:07:53,523 --> 00:07:55,490
行了 你说话就不能
Well, what if you said it

190
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,824
不那么高高在上?
without sounding so condescending?

191
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:59,093
我也想 但你的计划里面尽是些
I can try, but your plan has the words

192
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,162
"垃圾袋"和"牛肉棒"这种字眼!
"garbage bag" and "Slim Jim" in it!

193
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,364
- 嘿 发生什么了?  - 哦
- Hey, what's going on?  - Oh.

194
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:04,899
天才先生正想着用垃圾袋
Genius here wants to catch a bird

195
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,934
和牛肉棒抓鸟呢
with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.

196
00:08:11,274 --> 00:08:14,909
应该先放进袋子的
Should have put it in the bag first.

197
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,604
那么 如果您不介意的话
So, if you don't mind me asking,

198
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,638
可以问一下您会再谈恋爱吗?
do you think you might start dating again?

199
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,106
现在还为时太早
It's much too soon for that.

200
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,108
怎么? 你有合适的吗?
Why? Do you know someone?

201
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,178
不是 但如果我和Leonard哪天合不来了
No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard,

202
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,780
我会给您打电话的
I'll give you a call.

203
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:38,916
等等 您经常谈论星际迷航吗?
Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?

204
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:44,155
好啦 我们开始维多利亚派对吧
Okay, let's get this Victorian party started.

205
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,489
我查到了一些
I've done some research

206
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,758
我们可以玩的客厅游戏
about some traditional parlor games we can play.

207
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,993
有哪些?
Like what?

208
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:53,464
有一个很好玩的 叫做羊毛球
Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.

209
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,667
拿一个毛线球
You take a ball of wool,

210
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,170
把它放在桌子的正中央
and you put it right in the center of the table.

211
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,338
然后人们会
Then people sit

212
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,672
对面对地坐在桌子边
on opposite sides of the table

213
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:03,874
努力地把毛线球吹走
and try to blow the wool off.

214
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,347
对不起 她也有主了
Sorry. She's taken, too.

215
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,584
你知道我觉得你有什么毛病吗?
You know what I think your problem is?

216
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:14,452
你嫉妒了
You're jealous

217
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,053
因为在Koothrappali来之前
because you and I used to be

218
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,789
我和你是最好的朋友
best friends until Koothrappali came along.

219
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:21,292
你不就是找到了一个可以让你随意摆布的人吗?
And you found somebody you could push around?

220
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,593
- 嘿!  - 这个你别管
- Hey!  - Stay out of this.

221
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,129
好吧
Okay.

222
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:27,264
你知道吗 也许我和Raj关系那么好
You know, maybe I'm best friends with Raj

223
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:29,200
是因为他不觉得他比我更聪明
because he doesn't think he's smarter than me.

224
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,802
- 其实...  - 我说了让你别管!
- Actually...  - I said, stay out of it!

225
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,639
别... Raj 说吧 你刚刚想说什么现在说吧
N... No. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say.

226
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,840
我只是想说
All I'm gonna say is

227
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,875
你们两个别吵了
you guys need to stop this right now.

228
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,311
我... 我父母在吵架已经够不好的了
It... It's bad enough that my parents are fighting,

229
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:42,613
现在我还得听你们两个人吵架吗?
now I have to hear the two of you?

230
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:43,714
谁在乎谁更聪明?
And who cares who's smarter?

231
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,282
是Leonard 是我 还是...
If it's Leonard or me or...

232
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,918
今天是圣诞节 我们把Howard也算上吧
you know, it's Christmas, let's say it's Howard.

233
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,858
好啊 如果你那么聪明的话 你来把那只鸟搞出去
Well, if you're so smart, you get the bird out.

234
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,092
不行 是你把它放进来的
No, you're the one who let him in.

235
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,128
你怎么知道不是Leonard?
How do you know it wasn't Leonard?

236
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,096
这太明显了
Come on.

237
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,669
那件毛衣怎么样?
What about that sweater?

238
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,137
不行 它不够好
No, it's not good enough.

239
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,439
这个礼物一定要是完美的
It has to be perfect.

240
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,408
Howie给我送过的最好的礼物
I think the nicest gifts I've got from Howie

241
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,143
体现了他有多么了解我
show how well he knows me.

242
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,244
嗯
Hmm.

243
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,980
让我想想 我了解Amy什么?
Let's see, what do I know about Amy?

244
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:19,917
她喜欢中世纪文学 最爱的诗人是乔叟
She loves medieval literature; Chaucer's her favorite.

245
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,754
她看法国老电影的时候会双眼放光
And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies.

246
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:28,159
我喜欢她在听竖琴曲的时候食指舞动的样子
I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance

247
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,261
就好像她在跟着旋律一起弹
as if she's playing along.

248
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:33,264
哇 你真的很爱她啊
Wow, you really do love her.

249
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,933
是的
I do.

250
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,903
现在 让我们找找有什么礼物
Now, let's find the kind of gift

251
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,206
可以让她感觉自己又渺小又卑微
that makes her feel small and worthless.

252
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,570
你赢了!
You won!

253
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,842
完全没有赢的感觉 对吧?
Certainly doesn't feel like it, does it?

254
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,411
我的老婆以前
You know, my wife used to throw

255
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,646
经常举办这种主题派对
theme parties like this all the time.

256
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,982
我终于知道Raj那一套是从哪里学来的了
Oh, I guess that's where Raj gets it from.

257
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,651
他小的时候
Well, he and his mother spent a lot of time together

258
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:28,986
他和她妈妈经常在一起
when he was young.

259
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:30,154
我总是在工作
I was always working.

260
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,690
嘿 你知道吗 Raj正在
Hey, you know, Raj is dating

261
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,759
和一个工作狂医生约会
a doctor who works a lot.

262
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:37,061
他和他妈妈都喜欢同一个类型的
Him and his mom have a type.

263
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,331
你... 你... 这很好笑 不是吗?
You g... Y... You got to laugh at that, right?

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,200
不好笑吗? 好吧
No? All right.

265
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:48,706
好吧 让我理一理
All right, let me see if I've got this straight.

266
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:51,742
因为你的女朋友让你庆祝圣诞节
A picture of you on my lap

267
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,811
所以你想要用一张
is a way to punish your girlfriend

268
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,813
你坐在我腿上的照片来惩罚她?
for making you celebrate Christmas?

269
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,381
是的
Correct.

270
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,252
我觉得让她和你约会已经够惩罚她了
Santa thinks dating you may be punishment enough.

271
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,290
您说的很有道理
There's an argument for that.

272
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:08,192
但我想确保能惩罚到她
But I want to make sure.

273
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:09,026
笑一个
Smile.

274
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:10,861
吼 吼 吼!
Ho, ho, ho!

275
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,036
好吧 数到三
Okay. On the count of three,

276
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,238
我会用灭火器射他 让他飞起来
I'll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne.

277
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,774
Howard 你挥动那个毯子 把他赶到出口
Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit.

278
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,876
Raj 你把着帘子 让它飞出去
Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out.

279
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,345
你确定我这种笨蛋有能力
Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something

280
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,481
使用这么复杂的毯子吗?
as complicated as a blanket?

281
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,650
你要拿灭火器吗?
Do you want the fire extinguisher?

282
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,218
是的 太棒了
Yeah, I do. Great.

283
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,519
给你
Here you go.

284
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,721
好吧
Okay.

285
00:12:39,826 --> 00:12:42,393
一 二 三
One, two, three.

286
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,765
呃 你得把那根针拔出来
Uh, you have to take the pin out.

287
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,271
你现在想要拿毯子了 对吧?
You miss the blanket now, don't you?

288
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,142
数到三
On three.

289
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,778
一 二 三
One, two, three.

290
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,855
你做了什么?
What did you do?

291
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:12,823
刚刚那是意外
It was an accident.

292
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,959
哦天啊 天啊
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

293
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,861
放松 这不是你的错
Relax, it wasn't your fault.

294
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,495
可能它只是受惊吓了
Uh, maybe it's just stunned.

295
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:20,097
大哥 它... 它停止呼吸了
Dude, i... it's not breathing.

296
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,500
哦 不 我把它杀了
Oh, no. I killed it.

297
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,436
哦 不会吧 又这样
Oh, not again.

298
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,372
又这样是什么意思?
What do you mean, not again?

299
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,509
我十岁的时候
When I was ten,

300
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,280
我在我们家后院玩耍...
I was playing in my backyard and...

301
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,716
坐在了一只冠蓝鸦身上
sat on a blue jay.

302
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,653
我试图电击救活它
I mean, I tried to bring it back to life

303
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,623
但是它...
with electricity, but it just...

304
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,491
着火了
caught on fire.

305
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,631
最糟的是它闻上去还很香
The worst part was it smelled delicious.

306
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,067
呃 我找到了一篇文章
Uh, guys, I found an article here

307
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:59,236
它说你可以给鸟类做心肺复苏
that says you can do CPR on birds.

308
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,738
太棒了! 就这么做!
Great! Do it!

309
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,439
我才不干呢 你杀了他 你来
I'm not doing it. You killed him, you do it.

310
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,441
- 我来  - 不行
- I'll do it.  - No.

311
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,309
我来做
I need to do it.

312
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,511
这都怪我
This is on me.

313
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,083
好了
Okay.

314
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:16,153
"嘴对着喙呼气 轻轻按压胸腔"
"Mouth over beak and light chest compressions."

315
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,321
别太用力呼
Don't blow too hard.

316
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,157
你要是把它吹炸了 我会吐的
If you pop him, I will vomit.

317
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,260
怎么样了?
Anything?

318
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,429
我吃到好多牛肉棒
I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.

319
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,769
等等 等等 它的翅膀动了!
Wait, wait, his wing moved!

320
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,771
它眨眼睛了! 它还活着!
Oh, he blinked his eyes! He's alive!

321
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,205
真是圣诞奇迹啊!
It's a Christmas miracle!

322
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,841
我觉得是光明节奇迹 但是我就不和你争了
I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it.

323
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,841
{\an8}光明节:一个犹太教节日

324
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,811
来吧 小家伙 带你出去 把帘子掀起来
Come on, little guy, let's get you outside. Get the curtain.

325
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:51,722
某人真该去把那装载门关起来了
Someone should really close that loading door.

326
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,064
好吧 就这样吧
Well, that's that.

327
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,732
房间已经被污染了
The room's compromised.

328
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,567
他们要把所有过滤器都换了
They'll have to change all the filters,

329
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,437
也许还要把房间关个几周
probably shut it down for weeks.

330
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,340
你说得对 去吧 去找大楼管理处
You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services.

331
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,542
- 告诉他们这都是我的错  - 不 我们俩都有责任
- Tell them it was my fault.  - No, we're both to blame.

332
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,110
这次后果就让我来承担吧
You know, let me take the heat on this one.

333
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,378
别算上我就行
Yeah, just leave me out of it.

334
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,380
假如他们来了发现到处都是排泄物
You know if they come here and see crap everywhere,

335
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,749
他们只会去怪印度人的
they're just gonna blame the Indian guy.

336
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,723
嘿 对不起 我们还在实验室
Hey. I'm sorry, we're still here.

337
00:15:25,725 --> 00:15:27,157
没事吧?
Is everything okay?

338
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,559
就是有点无聊
It's kind of boring.

339
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,294
尽管气氛热烈了一小会
Although it did get exciting for a minute

340
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,763
当时Amy吸进了一个毛线球
when Amy inhaled a wool ball.

341
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,232
你估计你们还要多久?
How much longer do you think you'll be?

342
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,200
我不知道
I don't know.

343
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,701
还是有只鸟待在这
There's still a bird in here.

344
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,970
我们惹了一大堆麻烦
We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.

345
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,872
亲爱的 今天是平安夜 有谁会知道你们在那?
Honey, it's Christmas Eve. Who even knows you're in there?

346
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,907
不 我们在签到表上签名了
No, our names are on the sign-in sheet.

347
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:45,642
擦掉走人好了
So erase them and walk out.

348
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:47,344
不能那么做
I can't do that.

349
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,479
不能做什么?
Can't do what?

350
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,646
她说把我们在签到表上
She says take our names

351
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,081
签的名字擦掉 然后走人
off the sign-in sheet and leave.

352
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:53,617
- 我们可不能那么做  - 就是
- We can't do that.  - Yeah.

353
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,289
# 叮叮当 叮叮当 铃儿响叮当 #
# Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way #

354
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,991
# 我们滑雪多快乐 #
# Oh, what fun it is to ride #

355
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:03,660
# 我们飞奔向前方 嘿 #
# In a one-horse open sleigh, hey! #

356
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,630
嗯 Amy
Mmm. Amy,

357
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,499
那个布丁太美味了
that pudding was delicious.

358
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:11,368
除非你喜欢葡萄干
If you like raisins.

359
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,670
谢谢夸奖 那是无花果干
Thank you. And it's figs.

360
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,672

哦 这么说的话 那布丁还是挺不错的
Oh, in that case, it was pretty good.

362
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,411
你感觉怎么样? 你都没动你的鹅肉
You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.

363
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,180
和那只冠蓝鸦闻起来一个味儿
It smelled too much like blue jay.

364
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,416
要我帮你收桌子吗?
Can I help you clean up?

365
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,951
哦 你帮我急救把毛球弄出来了 你已经帮大忙了
Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; you're good.

366
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,423
你们说我们交换礼物怎么样
Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?

367
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,690
Sheldon 我们没带礼物
Oh, Sheldon, we didn't bring any.

368
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,325
我们以为你讨厌送礼物呢
I thought you hate giving gifts.

369
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,327
是啊 我讨厌
Yeah, I do.

370
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,696
所以我给Amy买了这个
Which is why I got Amy this.

371
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,165
你给我买了东西?
You got me something?

372
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,267
噢 这可不仅仅是东西
Oh, not just something, no.

373
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,669
这是我精心挑选 符合圣诞主题的礼物
It's from the heart, it's holiday-themed,

374
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,840
而且我把礼物小票给吃了 你没法退回去
and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it.

375
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,579
瞧你坐在圣诞老人腿上
Look at you on Santa's lap.

376
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,214

That's so sweet.

377
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,250
当然萌 这是最完美的礼物
Of course it is. It's the perfect gift.

378
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,819
你现在觉得怎么样?
H-How are you feeling right now?

379
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,288
内疚? 伤心?
Guilty? Sad?

380
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,490
恨不得变成犹太人?
Wishing you were Jewish?

381
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,560
不 我超爱它
No, I love it.

382
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,727
哦 是吗?
Oh, really?

383

386
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:24,308
就像我珍视你那样
as much as I treasure you.

387
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,544
但是你什么都没给我
And you got me nothing.

388
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,447
圣诞节被毁了
Christmas is ruined.

389
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,249
咱们再也别提圣诞了
Let's never speak of it again.

390
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,052
真是有趣
Well, this was fun.

391
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,753
实际上
Actually,

392
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,456
我给你准备了礼物
I did get you something.

393

咱们不是达成协议了吗?
But what about our agreement?

394
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:45,562
但是你给我买礼物了呀 拿着
Well, you got me something. Here.

395
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,368
曲奇?
Cookies?

396
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,904
这是你奶奶的圣诞曲奇饼
They're your Meemaw's Christmas cookies.

397
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,007
我打电话给她要到菜谱
I called and got the recipe.

They're perfect.

399

就像我在她的怀抱里一样
It tastes like her hugs.

400
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,693
圣诞快乐 Sheldon
Merry Christmas, Sheldon.

401
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:20,531
我真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

402
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,168
你很开心 我也很开心
You're happy, I'm happy.

403
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,537
也许节日是给予之日 并没有那么...
Well, maybe a holiday that's all about giving isn't so...

404
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,072
别碰我的饼干盒!
Get your hand out of that box!

405
00:18:37,881 --> 00:18:39,013
好了
Okay.

406
00:18:39,015 --> 00:18:42,917
下一个游戏叫做热豆子
The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.

407
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,188
真是好期待呢
Of course it is.

408
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,290
一个人在房间外
One person is sent out of the room

409
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,759
同时其他人都藏好一个小物品
while the others hide a small item.

410
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:53,060
然后他们邀请
Then they invite

411
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:54,895
第一个人回来 这么说
the first person back by saying,

412
00:18:54,897 --> 00:18:57,131
"晚饭吃热豆子和培根
"Hot boiled beans and bacon for supper,

413
00:18:57,133 --> 00:19:00,634
快点来要不菜都凉了"
hurry up before it gets cold."

414
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:05,507
要是你们觉得这次比我的汤姆汉克斯感恩节要好
If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving,

415
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:06,775
那就是你们疯了
you're all crazy.
