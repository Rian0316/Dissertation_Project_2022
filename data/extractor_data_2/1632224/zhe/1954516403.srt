that would bring the total up to 193 men.

好了  谢尔顿  我们都明白你意思了

359
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,740
So we multiply 193--

360
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,480
minus 21 men before the loss of virginity--

30.96 sexual partners.

364
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,640
Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

365
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,750
That is not even close to the real number.
