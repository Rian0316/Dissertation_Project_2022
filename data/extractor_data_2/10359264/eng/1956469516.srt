00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,253
Great, let's get
the party started.

357
00:15:50,297 --> 00:15:52,038
Karl, everyone's here.Oh, good.

358
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,474
Hello.
Hi.

359
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,606
[mutters]

360
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,528
Hey, guys.

361
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:06,791
Patty.Oh, here they are.

362
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,706
What a pleasure it is
to finally meet you.

363
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,447
I'm Ruby and
this is Dwight.

364
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:11,579
Charmed.DWIGHT:
Well, hello, there.

365
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,059
Hi. Sorry we're late.

366
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,365
Well, if you were busy
making yourself beautiful,

367
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,151
may I just say,
mission accomplished.

368
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,717
Heel, Dwight.[laughter]

369
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:22,285
I see I'm gonna have to
watch my step around you.

370
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,373
[laughs]

371
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,375
I can't tell you
how thrilled we are

372
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,768
that Amy's marrying
a young man

373
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,378
as admirable as your son.

374
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,293
That voice.

375
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,513
He's like someone on PBS.

376
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:33,818
Now, who wants champagne?

377
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:36,169
I'm sure we could all
be persuaded. [chuckles]

378
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:39,433
I could just listen
to him talk all day long.

379
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:43,219
If you were married
to him, you would.

380
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,788
Well, Ruby and I are just
as crazy about your daughter.

381
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,529
The whole family is.

382
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,139
Patty hasn't shut up
about her.

383
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:51,880
'Cause I'm happy, okay?

384
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,621
I'm finally getting
a sister.

385
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,189
Well, I'm thrilled
to finally be a part

386
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,668
of a big family.

387
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,888
I've always dreamed of hosting
large family gatherings.

388
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:01,498
RUBY: You know
what I dream about?

389
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:04,371
Grandkids.

390
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:05,807
Oh, I've had that dream.

391
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,114
I always wake up screaming.

392
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,680
Now, why don't you
want grandkids?

393
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,292
Well, I'd have to tell people
that I'm a grandmother.

394
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:15,338
And let's face it,
who's gonna believe me?

395
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:20,735
Does anyone need
more champagne?

396
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,302
Oh, God, yes.

397
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:23,477
Yes, absolutely.

398
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:29,657
Uh, I'm terribly sorry.
Will you excuse me?

399
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,399
I, uh, I desperately need
to use the facilities.

400
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,878
Listen to him.

401
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:37,143
He even makes taking a piss
sound fancy.

402
00:17:37,186 --> 00:17:38,535
[Dwight and Ruby laugh]

403
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,843
It is done!
I just wrote the words

404
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:44,193
"fade to black."

405
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:45,847
My script is complete!

406
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,762
Eli!
Aw!

407
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:51,287
Oh, my God. Oh.[Eli chuckling]

408
00:17:51,331 --> 00:17:53,898
Honey, that's amazing.Yeah, it is.

409
00:17:53,942 --> 00:17:56,901
You know what's amazing?
Somehow it all works.

410
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,426
I mean, the characters,
the plot, all of it.

411
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,254
I mean, I probably
used the word "fuck"

412
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:02,907
about 60 times too many,
but that's fixable.

413
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,910
I mean, the point is: I may
actually be a good writer.

414
00:18:05,954 --> 00:18:08,826
[laughs]Oh, I'm so proud of you.

415
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,872
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

416
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,395
JADE:
Oh...

417
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:13,744
Mm.

418
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:18,488
ELI: Mm. Oh, so
I called Lamar,

419
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,664
and he wants to
take us all

420
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,188
out to dinner tonight
to celebrate.

421
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:23,711
Oh, that'd be great.

422
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,930
We should go to La Serata.

423
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:29,238
Ooh, molto bene.
Yeah.

424
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:31,893
Hmm.Not to change the subject,

425
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:33,590
but I'm curious about something.

426
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:34,852
What's up?

427
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,681
While I was away,
did you two fuck?

428
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,511
I don't know why,
I just have a feeling.

429
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,599
Am I crazy?

430
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,515
[laughs]

431
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,431
We absolutely fucked.

432
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,824
Yeah.

433
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,610
Shit. Wow. Hmm.

434
00:18:54,959 --> 00:18:56,918
Are you upset?

435
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,529
Um...

436
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:00,922
I'm not sure.

437
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,579
It's not like you and I have
never done it without Eli.

438
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:06,754
[chuckles]

439
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:10,801
That's true.
Mm.

440
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:13,935
Okay.

441
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,764
Okay?

442
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,026
I mean, obviously
I have some feelings

443
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:19,767
that I need to work through,

444
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,725
but this was...
this was bound to happen, right?

445
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,597
At some point,
since we're all together now.

446
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,512
And I love you both,

447
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:29,298
so why... why would I not want
you guys to get closer?

448
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:31,866
Yes, exactly, and I-I knew
that if we were just open

449
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:33,259
and honest about
the whole thing,

450
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,783
that it wouldn't
be a big deal.

451
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:38,786
Yeah. Well, thank you
for telling me the truth.

452
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,048
It feels good to know.Of course.

453
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,398
Of course.Mm-hmm.

454
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,052
Oh, you know what,
you should tell Lamar

455
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:47,316
that I know the manager
at La Serata,

456
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,013
so she can get us
a good table.

457
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,928
Oh, yeah, yeah.

458
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,278
Totally. Great call.[phone chimes]

459
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,454
I will, um...

460
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,064
I-I will, I will
text Lamar right now.

461
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay.

462
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,373
[phone chimes]

463
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:10,731
So I can tell Rob is still
mad about the other night.

464
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,602
He hasn't called in days.

465
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:13,821
I thought about
calling him,

466
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,039
but I don't want
to seem desperate,

467
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,476
although I am
a little bit,

468
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,781
but he doesn't need
to know that.

469
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:19,479
Anyway...
[chuckles]

470
00:20:19,522 --> 00:20:21,481
what do you think I should do?

471
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,439
Hmm. What?

472
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:25,963
[chuckles]
Listen to me.

473
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,531
I must be boring you to tears
always talking about Rob.

474
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,880
No, I'm sorry.

475
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,665
I was thinking about
this woman I met today.

476
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,493
I can't get her
out of my mind.

477
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,798
Why?

478
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,670
I was at her door
dropping something off,

479
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:39,325
and, just, something
wasn't quite right.

480
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:41,327
How do you mean?

481
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,547
She was worried about
her husband.

482
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,680
I could hear him
calling for her.

483
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,551
There was just
something about his tone.

484
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,988
It scared me.

485
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,642
Then he came to the door,

486
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,515
and he was charming.

487
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,476
This woman, was she wearing
a lot of makeup?

488
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,478
She was.

489
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,132
How did you know that?

490
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:06,569
He hits her.

491
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,484
You think?

492
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,357
No, he isn't the type.
He's very successful.

493
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,576
My father was a doctor.

494
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,364
I used to watch my mother
apply makeup

495
00:21:18,407 --> 00:21:20,540
to cover up her black eyes.

496
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:23,151
Oh, no.

497
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:27,416
She would smear green concealer
to cover the bruise,

498
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,679
and then she would apply
a second layer of concealer

499
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,551
that matched her skin tone.

500
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:33,988
And then she would do
the same thing to the other side

501
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:36,599
so that people wouldn't
notice the difference.

502
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,516
That's awful.

503
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,910
No, here's the awful part.

504
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,914
My whole family knew
what was going on.

505
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:48,176
Aunts, uncles,

506
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,396
cousins-- they all knew
what he was doing,

507
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:52,006
and they just looked
the other way.

508
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,618
I hate people that
look the other way.

509
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,584
And he told the owner
he was willing to match

510
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,542
any offer the Gibson twins

511
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:08,065
could come up with.

512
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,546
[laughs]
And that's how

513
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,897
Dwight cornered the
Tulsa County market

514
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:15,421
for earth-moving machinery.

515
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,422
[laughter]

516
00:22:16,465 --> 00:22:17,553
The next thing that happened...

517
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:18,859
Please stop!

518
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,952
Until I find Karl.
[laughs]

519
00:22:24,995 --> 00:22:28,651
He would hate to miss
this amazing story.

520
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,697
DWIGHT:
He has been

521
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,089
in the gents' room
quite a while.

522
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:33,439
Uh, you want me
to check on him?

523
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,964
[laughs]:
No. I-I've got this.

524
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:48,105
Ma'am, that's the men's room.Oh, I know.

525
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:51,152
My husband isn't hiding out
in the ladies' room.

526
00:22:51,195 --> 00:22:52,719
[gasps]

527
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:02,685
So nice to finally
meet you, Lamar.

528
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,513
I've heard so much about you.

529
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,733
Heard a lot about
you, too, pretty lady.

530
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,604
And I have so many questions.

531
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:10,998
Please don't ask them.[laughs] Come on.

532
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,043
I'm paying for this meal.

my relationship with Delores.

No.

Eli was having some
problems with his story,

so I read the
first 50 pages,

560
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,972
and I-I gave him
a few ideas.

561

saved my ass is what she did.

some thoughts

It's not your fault.

You did nothing wrong.
I'm just...

I don't know.

you want me to go?

this whole thing's working.

Don't you hear?
They're playing "The Twist."

That's terrific. I'm eating pie.Forget about the pie.

Come on. I want to dance.Well, here's your partner.

She's just like me,
but smaller and stickier.

Come on, honey,

Um... No, I don't think so.

Aw, come on.
Don't make me dance alone.

Seriously, I have two left feet.

her away in front of everyone.

Is that why we go to parties?

So you can flirt
with strange men?

Maybe you'd like to stay
a little longer?

Give him a chance to cool off.

to be strong like you.

787
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,448
That's the reason we became
Southern Baptist.

788
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,494
Those Methodists were just
a little too liberal

Challenging.

It's a challenge,
but a fun one.

Speaking of marriage,

809
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,237
I'm just curious, Simone,

810
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:38,283
how many times
have you been married?

811
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,328
Just three. Why?

812
00:36:40,372 --> 00:36:41,764
It's just an innocent question,
my love.

813
00:36:41,808 --> 00:36:44,245
I wasn't talking to you.I know.

814
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:46,682
Why are you
so cross with him?

815
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:49,250
I wasn't cross. Was I cross?

816
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,773
You were
definitely cross.

RUBY:
Um, not that it's

818
00:36:52,297 --> 00:36:54,124
any of my business, but...

819
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:57,258
if I were twice divorced,
then hooked a man

820
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,217
like Karl,

821
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,262
I'd treat him a little nicer.

822
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,703
Now I'm curious
about something, Ruby.

823
00:37:07,747 --> 00:37:11,446
How would you treat Karl
if you walked into the bathroom

824
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,274
and found him
kissing another man?

825
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,841
Mm.

00:37:19,672 --> 00:37:21,804
Bravo, Simone.

00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,502
That's right, sugar.

828
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:24,764
Karl is gay.

829
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:26,374
Still have a
crush on him?

830
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,158
Your stepdad is gay?

831
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:29,682
I thought he was just English.

832
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:32,162
That's why
we're getting divorced.

833
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,686
Dear God. Another divorce?

834
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:35,557

the headline, Dwight.

At dinner, in the bathroom.

Shit. She d--

she doesn't know that I took
anything, though, right?

No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

886
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,911
What do you mean, "No"?

887
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:55,131
I have to. This is too big.

888
00:39:56,176 --> 00:39:57,395
Fuck.

889
00:39:57,438 --> 00:40:00,180
[exhales]:
What am I gonna do?

890
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,877
I mean,
she's already questioning

891
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:03,313
our living arrangement.

892
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:05,315
If she finds out about this,
it doesn't matter

893
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:09,058
how she feels about me.
I am out on the street.

894
00:40:09,102 --> 00:40:11,409
I don't have
anywhere to go, Eli.

895
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:14,281
And Willow and Mischa are gone
and Duke is still out there.Listen.

896
00:40:14,324 --> 00:40:16,152
And I...Jade, Jade, listen-listen to me.

897
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:19,547
That's not gonna happen. Okay?
I'm not gonna let that happen.

898
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:21,288
I need you here.Why?

899
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:23,333
Because I'm your muse or am I,
am I just your dealer?

900
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,900
[stammers]

901
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,075
I'm-I'm done
with the pills. Okay?

902
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:28,382
Done.

903
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,905
So she doesn't need to know.

904
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:32,430
In that case, give them to me.

905
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,041
What?If you're done
with them,

906
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:37,173
then there's no reason
that you can't give them back.

907
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:39,175
So?

908
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:42,135
Look, the thing is, one of
the producers who's interested

909
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,441
wants a rewrite.I knew it.

910
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:44,616
[stammers] She's got
some really great ideas.

911
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:46,139
Lamar says if I can
turn out a draft

912
00:40:46,182 --> 00:40:47,357
by Friday...Eli.

913
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:48,489
[whispers]:
J-- All right, fine.

914
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,448
Jesus, just take them....

915
00:40:51,623 --> 00:40:54,103
[sighs]

916
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:59,935
Just, I'm-I'm-I'm so,
I'm so, so close

917
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,589
to getting my career back.

918
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,983
You can handle
a few rewrites without them.

919
00:41:04,026 --> 00:41:05,375
[chuckles]

920
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:08,117
Yeah, all I know
is that I used to be a writer

921
00:41:08,161 --> 00:41:10,293
and an addict,
and then I got clean,

922
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:12,470
and all of a sudden,
I wasn't a writer anymore.

923
00:41:13,688 --> 00:41:15,342
But if I can do this,

924
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:16,952
if I can, if I can
finish this thing

925
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,345
and if I can get it
to them on time,

926
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:19,564
then, you know, I'm...[claps hands]

927
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:21,304
[grunts]
I'm back.

928
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,480
I will be legit again,

929
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,090
they will
trust me again

930
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,483
and the money
that will follow, Jade...

931
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,400
...I can take care of you.

932
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,622
Please.

933
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,191
I need them.

934
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:58,167
And you promise
you'll take care of me?

935
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:03,695
I promise.

936
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,056
[exhales]

937
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,104
Let's get to work on your movie.

938
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,638
Christ, what an evening.

939
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:36,031
I'm exhausted.

940
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,772
Oh, you're not
staying here tonight.

941
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,689
Is that so?

942
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:44,692
I want you to pack your
things and leave, now.

943
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,564
Oh, knock it off, Simone.

944
00:42:46,607 --> 00:42:48,348
I'm angry enough as it is.

945
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:51,307
You're angry? My daughter
may never speak to me again.

946
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,179
Oh, and whose fault is that?

947
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:56,748
If you'd just kept your mouth
shut instead of humiliating me.

948
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,706
I was provoked.

949
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,101
Oh, so there was no possible way
you could suppress the impulse

950
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,059
to blow up the entire evening?

951
00:43:04,103 --> 00:43:06,061
Says the man
who couldn't stop himself

952
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:08,586
from sneaking off
to the men's room for a quickie.

953
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:09,717
Oh, fuck you!

954
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:15,767
I've spent my whole damn life
controlling myself,

955
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,160
hiding the central fact
of my existence

956
00:43:18,204 --> 00:43:21,686
so I wouldn't disappoint my
family, my friends or my wife.

957
00:43:21,729 --> 00:43:24,079
Hector was
the only person

958
00:43:24,123 --> 00:43:25,690
who ever saw me
for the man I truly am,

959
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,301
not the one
I was pretending to be.

960
00:43:30,303 --> 00:43:32,610
You have no idea
what he meant to me.

961
00:43:32,653 --> 00:43:36,309
Stop romanticizing
your grubby little fling.

962
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,745
I loved him!

963
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:40,705
He asked me
to run away with him.

964
00:43:40,748 --> 00:43:45,231
Um, but I-I had made
a commitment to you,

965
00:43:45,274 --> 00:43:47,450
so I chose to stay.

966
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:52,630
I am your wife.

967
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:55,633
Am I supposed to be grateful
that you didn't walk out?

968
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,637
I just want you to see it
from my perspective for once.

969
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,639
Just think

970
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:04,685
about what it may have cost me
to honor the vow I made to you.

971
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:07,514
So no, Simone,
I do not expect you

972
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:09,690
to be grateful
for the sacrifice I made,

973
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:13,476
but for fuck's sake,
at least acknowledge it.

974
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,481
I am going to bed.

975
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:20,483
Not in the guest room.

976
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:23,486
In our room, in our bed.

977
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,619
You sleep
where you like.

978
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,295
The Thompsons just left.

979
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:51,340
Said to thank you
for a lovely time.

980
00:44:56,215 --> 00:44:58,696
So, you're not talking to me.

981
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:01,742
What am I
supposed to say?

982
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:04,527
It was a party.

983
00:45:04,571 --> 00:45:07,530
I wasn't gonna cause a scene.

984
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:11,752
He hurt her,
right in front of you,

985
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,754
and you did nothing.

986
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,452
What was I supposed to do?
Hit him?

987
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:19,629
I mean, I'm sure our guests
would have loved that.

988
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:21,457
You could have at
least confronted him.

989
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:24,286
Reminded him that kind of
behavior is unacceptable.

990
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,766
The guy had been drinking.

991
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,116
I-I'm sure he didn't mean
to hurt her.

992
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,467
This is not the first time
he's gotten rough with her.

993
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:33,426
How do you know that?

994
00:45:34,644 --> 00:45:37,125
She had several bruises
on her arm.

995
00:45:37,169 --> 00:45:40,433
That's why she's wearing
long sleeves on such a hot day.

996
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:43,305
If it's that bad, why
doesn't she leave him?

997
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:45,655
And where would
she go, Rob? Here?

998
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:47,657
Will you let her
sleep on our sofa?

999
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:50,312
Jesus, Beth Ann, I don't know.

1000
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,314
And what if Ralph comes
banging on our door

1001
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:54,316
in the middle of the night
to try to drag her back?

1002
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,319
Would you have the balls
to stand up to him then?

1003
00:45:57,363 --> 00:45:58,712
Don't use that kind of language.

1004
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,366
Of course you wouldn't.
You would just slink away

1005
00:46:00,409 --> 00:46:01,715
like the coward you are!

1006
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:03,717
Okay!

1007
00:46:05,545 --> 00:46:07,503
He's not
the perfect husband.

1008
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:10,289
It's not my job to judge him!

1009
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:12,552
Would you like the neighbors
coming in here and judging you

1010
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:14,380
for not being
the perfect mother?

1011
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,425
Huh?!

1012
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:25,870
I'm just saying,
leave it alone.

1013
00:46:43,888 --> 00:46:47,369
[exhales] I didn't know
you were still here.

1014
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:48,849
I was just upstairs.

1015
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:52,374
Just... picking up some trash.

1016
00:46:52,418 --> 00:46:54,855
So you heard everything?

1017
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:57,640
Yeah.

1018
00:46:57,684 --> 00:47:00,513
What was that all about?

1019
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,734
Honey.

1020
00:47:04,778 --> 00:47:07,737
It's okay.

1021
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:10,436
You can talk to me.

1022
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:15,267
Whatever it is, I don't judge.

1023
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:28,454
Our daughter died because of me.

1024
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:34,982
I'm the one who's responsible.

1025
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,336
[doorbell rings]

1026
00:47:44,992 --> 00:47:47,690
Simone.

1027
00:47:47,734 --> 00:47:49,431
What are you doing here?

1028
00:47:49,475 --> 00:47:53,000
I need to know. Do you love him?

1029
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,787
I do.

1030
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:02,444
Okay, then invite me in.

1031
00:48:02,488 --> 00:48:04,838
We have a lot to talk about.
