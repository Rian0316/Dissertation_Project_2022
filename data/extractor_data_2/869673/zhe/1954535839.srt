直到她甩了他 只身前往旧金山

而复原的过程花了很长一段时间

很奇怪, 出汗?
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,119
就像是一种难闻的液体从你的皮肤上渗出来

见到你很高兴

65
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,419
可是你却带她回家了
You went home with her.

66
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,009
是的
Yes, I did.

67
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,509
不过她说如果不是我的出现
But she told me that if it wasn't for me,

68
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:07,894
你就有机会和她来一次
you would have had a shot with her,

69
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,039
所以, 昨晚你完全成功了, 很好!

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,809

今晚, 我们再去一家酒吧...

Barney, 我不会再和你出去了

75
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,049
拜托!

76
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:24,975
我会教你我所有的策略
I'll, I'll teach you all of my strategies.

哦是吗?
Oh, really?

78
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:29,714
我的最爱, 7号策略 给你的一切蒙上一层神秘的面纱
My favorite, number seven: Create a mystery about yourself.

79
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,409
这样就引起了她们的兴趣 他们不得不一个晚上都围着你转
That way, they become so intrigued, they have to hang out with you all night.

80
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,719
哦, 真的管用?
Oh, come on, does that really work?

81
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,479
也许有, 也许没有
Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn'T.

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,319
混蛋, 你勾起了我的兴趣
Damn it, that's intriguing.

83
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,659
好吧, 我参加
Okay, I'm in.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,049
- 我有点事情要告诉你 - 你绝对不会相信发生了什么的
- I have something you've got to hear. - You will not believe what just happened.

85
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:50,609
你先说
You go first.

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,444
我在地铁上找到一个1939年的硬币
I found a 1939 penny on the subway.

87
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,330
想像一下, 这个小东西上蕴含了多少历史...
Just imagine the kind of history this little copper guy...

88
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,120
Lily回来了

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,319
你绝对不会喜欢的
You're not going to like it.

94
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,035
我现在感觉很好
I am doing great.

95
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,044
这是一个完美的夏天
This summer, best thing ever!

96
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,909
旧金山绝对值得一去
San francisco is so happening right now.

97
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,329
她还这么开心?!
She's happy?!

98

Marshall熬过了人生中最糟糕的一个夏天 她居然还这么开心
Marshall had the worst summer of his life, and she's happy.

99
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,319
是的, 我想她的艺术课似乎很完美
Yeah, and I suppose her art program was all fulfilling or whatever.

100
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,589
哦, 那个艺术课程...
Oh.The art program...

101
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,699

这是你最出色的作品
This is your best work.

104
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,399
在我的教学生涯中 我从来没看到过这么...
In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so...

105
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,629
废话不说了, 这就说是艺术
needless to say, this is art.

106
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:45,189
我已经没东西可以教给你了
I can't teach you anything.

107
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,489
但是在SF最棒的一部分...
but the best part of S.F.

108
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:52,639
哦, 我们管旧金山叫SF...
Oh, that's what we call san francisco...

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,719
是那里的人
the people.

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,039
在公车上也是
Even just riding around on the bus all summer.

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,309
简直就像是人类展览馆
It was like a human tapestry.

112
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,974
嗨, 我叫Mike
Hi, I'm mike.

哦, 她真是一个...
Oh, she's such A...

120
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,410
在对Marshall的所作所为之后 她又回来来搞破坏
after what she did to marshall, she should come back here devastated,

121
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,249
她完全应该满怀歉意和悔意的
crawling on all fours over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.

122
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,599
不要倾向谁
You never chose sides.

123
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,639
我尊重她的决定
I respect that.

124
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,299
她简直是不可理喻, 无法让人相信
She's unbelievable. Unbelievable.

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,449
无法让人相信?
Unbelievable?

126
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,839
什么无法让人相信
What's unbelievable?

127
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,224
听着, Marshall
Listen, marshall.

128
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,939
Ted在地铁上找到一个铜板,旧的 真是有趣
Ted found a penny on the subway, and it's old, and that's interesting.

129
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,699

Way to go.

130
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,069
好吧, 首先, 那确实有意思
Okay, first of all, that is interesting.

131
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,914
其次, 我们得告诉他
Second, we have to tell him.

132
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:56,489
不, 我们不能, 他才刚刚恢复过来 才会和Barney一起出去
No, we don'T.He's just starting to get better, going out with barney.

133
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,859
我是说, 如果他听说Lily又有了新欢 会怎么想
I mean, how do you think he's going to feel when he hears lily's moved on?

134
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,299
- 她又有新欢了? - 有可能
- She's moved on? - It happens.

135
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,393
以前我也是这样的
I've fallen out of love faster than that before,

136
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,899
有时候, 完全没有先兆就...
sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever.

137
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,699
当天我们还再热恋 第二天, 他在我面前就像死的一样了
One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me.

138
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,589
但是我们现在很好 亲爱的
But we're great. Honey.

139
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,459
现在, 我们来复习一下Barney的 关于不要约会只要做爱的战略
Now, let's review barney's rules for mating without dating.

140

第二课, 第五节
Lesson two, corollary five.

141
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,699
让一个美女清醒感觉自己没有吸引力 这样她就完全在你的股掌之中了
Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive, and she'll be putty in your hands.

142
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,859
很好
Excellent.

143
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,939
- 你决定你的主菜了吗? - 是的
- Have you chosen your entree? - I have.

144
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,989
一个黑皮肤女人, 8点方向
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

145
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:33,899
9点方向
Nine o'clock.

146
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,498
十点...半 她走向吧台了
Ten... thirty. She's walking to the bar.

147
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,480
- 她? 真的? - 是的

148
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,444
哦你是对的
No, you're right.

149
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,639
野心是成功最大的敌人
Ambition is the enemy of success.

150
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,599
好吧, 准备出击
Okay.Hit it.

151
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,744
怎么了, 四眼女郎 你有散光还是什么?
what's the matter, four eyes, you got astigmatism or something?

152
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,959
抱歉, 我只是想缓和一下气氛 我刚刚从一段很长的关系中走出来
I'm sorry, I was trying to playfully disarm you, but I just got out of a long relationship.

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,459
我完全不知道我在干什么
I have no idea what I'm doing.

154
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,360
- 我叫Marshall - 你好, Marshall 我叫Amy
- I'm marshall. - Hi, marshall. Amy.

155
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,365
别担心, 我也是过来人
Don't worry. I've been there.

156
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,259
等等
Hold on.

157
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,969
不错, 我想起作用了
Nice recovery. I think it's working.

158
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,554
Amy, 这是我的朋友Barney Barney, 这是Amy
Um, amy.This is my friend, barney.Barney, this is amy.

00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,859
- 嗨, Barney, 很高兴见到你 - 嗨
- Hi, barney.Nice to meet you. - Hi.

160
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,329
Amy, 你喜欢...魔术吗?
Amy, do you like... magic?

161
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,689
- 我恨你 - 真是抱歉
- I hate you. - I am so sorry.

162
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,524
这是一种病
It's a sickness.

163
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,149
我才是真正的受害者
I'm the real victim here.

164
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,457
2次了, 你2次抢走我的糖果 那本该是属于我的
Twice. Twice in a row, you took my candy. That was my candy.

165
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,479
- 我知道, 不过今晚.. - 不, 想都别想
- I know, but tonight... - no.Forget it.

166
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,089
你这个混蛋
You're such a jackass.

167
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,649
我以为你会叫我傻子
I thought you were gonna call me a jerk.

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,390
好吧, 我很抱歉 我会让你成功一次的
All right, I'm sorry.I will make it up to you.

169
00:07:43,391 --> 00:07:48,139
今晚我们去纽约大学附近的酒吧
Tonight, we'll go to a college bar near nyu- the scorpion and the toad.

170
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,048
我想对于年轻人你会显得更加成熟 更加见过世面
I figure in a younger crowd you'll seem more mature, more worldly and,

171
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:55,029
以及作为一个3年级法律学生 显得更加聪明一点
as a third-year law student, more smarter.

172
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,479
好吧, 不过不许用魔法
Okay, but no magic.

173
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,854
你是怎么做到的?
How did you do that?

174
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,359
我在撒尿, 傻子
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

175
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,039
Robin和我在Lily要租的公寓外面见了面
Robin and I met lily outside the next apartment she was seeing.*******

176
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,729
但是我需要自由去追逐我的梦想
But I need the freedom to really chase my passion,

177
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:19,779
画画或者是音乐 也许是两者皆有
which was painting, but now I think it's music or spoken word- maybe both.

178
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,919
上帝啊, 生活真是美好不是吗?
God!Isn't life amazing?

179
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,249
见到你真是太好了, Ted
It is so great to see you, ted.

180
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,919
我要去锁盒里取钥匙去了
I'm going to get the key from the lockbox.

181
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,494
怎么了?
What?

182
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,779
她太可怜了
She's miserable.

183
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,429
她已经发现自己犯了一个很大的错误
She's realized she's made a huge mistake.

184
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,069
她和Marshall会在一周内复合
Her and marshall will be back together in a week.

185
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,939
我喜欢这样!
I love it!

186
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,030
哦不, 你只是希望Lily变得很可怜
Um, no.You just want lily to be miserable.

187
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:40,289
但是事实上, 她很开心
The truth is, she's happy.

188
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,219
相信我, 我认识Lily有9年了
Trust me.I've known lily for nine years.

189
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,510
相信我, 我是一个女生
Trust me.I'm a girl.

190
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:45,414
是的, 不过你是加拿大人
Yeah, but you're canadian.

191
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,759
- 你为什么总是提这个事情? - 你是我们邻居中特殊的一个
- Why do you always have to bring that up? - You're our weird neighbors to the north.

192
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,019
每次你都要提起这个事情
You bring it up every time.

193
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,849
好吧好吧, 5美元打赌她还喜欢Marshall
All right, five bucks says she still wants marshall.

194
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,039
你说吧
You're on.

195
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,674
5美元
Five american bucks.

196
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,766
见鬼
Damn it.

197
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,479
好吧, 那么我们怎么套她的话?
Okay, so how do we get the truth out of her.

198
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,654
龙舌兰酒
Tequila.

199
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:00,629
这是她的致命伤
It's her weakness.

200
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,689
3杯, 她就无话不说了
Three shots, she'll tell you the truth about anything.

201
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,249
我想这就是我的新家
I hope this is my new home.

202
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,629
好吧, 我想我还是要第一个公寓好了
Yeah, I'm going to take that first apartment.

203
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,999
- Marshall Eriksen, 换衣服 - 不用了
- marshall eriksen, suit up! - No way.

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,739
好吧, 你这样还不错
Yeah, you're good in that.

205
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,739
- 走吧 - 等等
- Let's go. - wait.

206
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,989
清空你的口袋
Empty your pockets.

207
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,649
快走
Come on.

208
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,209
- 快点, 我们... - 袖子
- Come on, let'S... - sleeves.

209
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,389
- 没有东西在我的... - 哦, 是吗?
- There is nothing in my... - oh, is that right?

210
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,899
我们走
Let's go.

211
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,150
看看我耳朵后面
behind my ear.

212
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,279
你耳朵后面没有...
There is nothing behind your...

213
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,274
是的, 我在读法律预科
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.

214
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,749
我快死了, 工作量太大了
The workload's killing me, though.

215
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,699
哦, 和我说说
Oh, tell me about it.

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,249
我是哥伦比亚大学法学三年级 所以...
I'm third year at columbia law, so...

217
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,959
如果工作量真的会杀了你 那我会定它的罪的
If the workload does kill you, I can probably get a conviction.

218
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,889
好吧
yeah.

219
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:10,510
你一定是化学专业的 因为我们之间似乎有一种...
You must be majoring in chemistry, 'cause what I'm picking up between us is, uh...

220
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,869
大学女同性恋
college lesbian phase.

221
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,539
听着, 我要走了 不过很希望再次见到你
Listen, I got to go, but it'd be great to see you again.

222
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,569
哦会的
Yes, it would.

223
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,259
真的会的
It really would.

224
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,149
也许还会在这里见到你
Well, maybe I'll see you here sometime.

225
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,129
应该不会了 我从来不来这里, 所以...
Probably not.I'm never here, so...

226
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,539
你知道, 我有电话号码
you know, I do have a phone number.

227
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,999
太棒了
Great.

228
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,029
很好
Nice.

229
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,819
- 嗨, 我叫Barney - 哦, 不
- Hi, I'm barney. - Oh, no.

230
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,679
你介不介意给我的朋友留个电话号码?
Do you... mind giving my friend your phone number?

231
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,089
当然
Sure.

232
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,495
哇哦!
Whoo!

233
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:51,330
我做到了! 我拿到女生的电话了
I did it!I got a girl's phone number.

234
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,824
哦, 她写的字真可爱, 看
Oh, and her handwriting is so cute, look.

235
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,899
哦, 我想带她出去吃中国菜 然后一起漫步公园
Oh, I'm gonna take her out for chinese food and then maybe we'll walk through the park.

236
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,279
这真是太...怎么了?
It'll be so... what?

237
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,629
抱歉, 伙计 这东西我收下了
Sorry, buddy, I'm taking this one, too.

238
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,659
我想杀了你!
I'll kill you!

239
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,408
然后, 我发现这个地方, 北海滩
And then, I discovered this area, north beach.

240
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,294
最棒的海滩
Best beach ever!

241
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:16,500
我好像总是在说我的夏天
Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer.

242
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,221
你们如何?
How are you guys doing?

243
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,803
Marshall怎么样了?
And hey, how's marshall?

244
00:11:19,903 --> 00:11:21,840
- 把卡片给我! - 我不会给你的
- Give me the card! - I'm not giving you any card.

245
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:23,429
- 我发誓...! - 你不会得到...!
- I swear...! - You are not getting...!

246
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,269
很好
Terrific.

247
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,745
那很好啊
That is so good to hear.

248
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,480
等等
oh, hold on.

249
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,389
应该是关于公寓的事情
This could be about the apartment.

250
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,539
好吧, 我们已经过了审查Lily的时期
okay, we're way past truth-telling-lilly and about to hit

251
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,999
我不想再说什么了
cinco-de-mayo-1998-lilly and I'm not cleaning that up again.

252
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,139
恭喜, 你赢了
So, congratulations, you win.

253
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,239
她的确很开心
She's happy.

254
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,699
我不相信
I didn't get it.

255
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,413
之前那个公寓, 我...
That first apartment,I...

256
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,483
我等的太长了...
I waited too long and...

257
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,699
被别人租走了
somebody else got it.

258
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,509
有趣
interesting.

259
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,239
哇哦, Lily, 你似乎对于这个 有很强的反应
Wow, lily, you, uh... seem to be having a pretty strong reaction on losing an apartment.

260
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,329
我想是不是因为它让你回想起一些失去的东西
I wonder if it's because it reminds you of something else you lost because you couldn't commit.

261
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:11,039
不, Lily, 你只是为拱型房顶和实木地板才哭的吧
no, lily, you're crying over the crown molding and the real hardwood floors.

262
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,609
没有更深刻的含义了
There's no deeper meaning.

263
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,499
对不对, Lily?
Right, lily?

264
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,329
别哭了, 告诉他
Just quit crying and tell him.

265
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:21,376
那个公寓代表Marshall
the apartment is a metaphor for marshall.

266
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,179
停! 我打赌你不想看到我生气的样子
stop! You don't want to see what I'm like when I'm angry.

267
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,429
等等!
Hold on!

268
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,269
如果我们没办法好好解决这个问题 那我们谁也别想得到这个号码
If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number.

269
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,794
- 停车! - 什么...?
- stop the cab. - Wha...?

270
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,168
不等等, Marshall!
no, wait.Come on. Marshall!

271
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,729
81街, 谢谢
81st and first, please.

272
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,659
她的字的确很可爱
Ah, she does have cute handwriting.

273
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,369
关于宿醉, 每个人都有自己特殊的疗法
The thing about a hangover is that everyone has their own special remedy.

274
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:57,057
早上好 想要吃什么?
Waiter: Morning, guys. What can I get you?

275
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,069
给我你们这里最棒的金枪鱼三明治
Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you goT.

276
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,559
还有一瓶牛奶
And a milkshake.

277
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,039
你呢, 先生?
For you, sir?

278
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,209
肉汤
Gravy.

279
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,133
要加点什么吗?
You want that gravy on something?

280
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,719
给我点惊喜吧
Surprise me.

281
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,862
如果我男友不在这里我也想点肉汤
I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

282
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:16,821
开玩笑的
Just kidding.

283
00:13:16,822 --> 00:13:17,700
我什么都不要
I'm good.

284
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,439
你这么活泼干什么?
What are you so chirpy about?

285
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,379
她还醉着呢
She's still drunk from last night.

286
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,218
我不觉得
I don't think so.

287
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,874
听着, 既然你这么想要和Marshall和好 为什么你2天后才问起关于他的事情?
Look, if you want marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to even ask about him?

288
00:13:34,874 --> 00:13:36,232
我很想问
I was dying to ask.

289
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,631
我只是在装酷
I was just trying to play it cool.

290
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,831
但是真的...
But really...

291
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,719
很好, 我是说工作很不错...
but it's good, I mean, work is great...

292
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,180
拜托, 谈一些关于Marshall的事情
Lily: Come on, say something about marshall.

293
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:45,520
Marshall在哪里? 他怎么样了? 他现在在做什么?
Where's marshall? How's marshall? What's marshall doing right now?

294
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:49,249
闭嘴, 谈谈Marshall
Shut up and talk about marshall.

295
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,929
marshall...我要问了!
Marshall, marshall, marshall, marshall... I've got to ask!

296
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,049
Marshall怎么样了?
And hey, how's marshall?

297
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,729
这是一个很糟糕的夏天
It was such an awful summer.

298
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,189
我想回来见他
I just wanted to get back here and see him.

299
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,335
我以为你的夏天很棒
But I thought your summer was great.

300
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,992
并不
Not exactly.

301
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,537
哦上帝啊
Oh, my god.

302
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,064
这就是你的杰作?
This is you best work?

303
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:13,341
在我的教学生涯中, 从来没见过这么...
In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so needless.

304
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,599
完全不是艺术的东西...
To say this is... art...

305
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,519
我没法教你
I can't teach you anything.

306
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,519
那些公车上遇到的人呢?
So all those interesting people you met on the bus?

307
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,941
是的, 嗯...
Yeah, um...

308
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,949
我叫Mike
I'm mike.

309
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,739
我是一个反佛教徒冒险旅行作家
I'm a buddhist monk slash adventure travel writer.

310
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,239
我叫Paula
I'm paula.

311
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,509
我是一个专为孩子们唱歌的朋克乐团歌手
I sing in a punk band for children.

312
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,020
我叫Dan, 我是一个神经外科医生
I'm dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.

313
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,689
你真是迷人
You are stunning, by the way.

314
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,460
我一直没和你们联系 因为我没这个脸
I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed.

315
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,260
我的一切都很糟糕
I screwed everything up.

316
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,497
我没用工作, 没有地方住
I have no job, no place to live.

317
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,141
我还失去了我的挚爱
I lost the love of my life.

318
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,174
我知道我没资格这么问
I know I have no right to ask this,

319
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:02,295
不过你们觉得Marshall还会重新接受我吗?
but do you think marshall would take me back?

320
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,259
这是一次打击
In a heartbeat.

321
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,479
如果你打电话给他 也许他会接受你
If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.

322
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,279
那我应该打电话给他
So maybe I should call him.

323
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,979
也许吧
Maybe.

324
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:14,938
不! 这个..哇哦!
No!This is... ow!

325
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,199
等等
Hold on.

326
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,409
听着, 如果你打算回去
Look, if you're going to go back to him,

327
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,372
那我就不想听到"也许"这个词
I don't want to hear the word "maybe.

328
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:22,948
你的字典里没有这个词
" "Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary.

329
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,792
这次分手差点杀了他
This breakup almost killed him.

330
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,708
他没有办法再承受一次
And he cannot go through it again.

331
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,450
所以, 除非你真的定了心意 不然就离他远点
So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.

332
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,531
这个人喜欢铜板
This guy likes pennies.

333
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,019
嘿, Marshall
Hi, marshall.

334
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,210
不, 滚开, 我不想和你说话
No, go away.I don't want to talk to you.

335
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:49,419
好吧, 我知道之前几次我犯了道德上的错误
Okay, I know what I did a couple nights back is in a moral gray area.

336
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,389
但是有一个好消息就是, 她喜欢你
But the great news is, she loved you.

337
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,233
如果事情发生在你身上 你们已经出去好多次了
If things had gone your way - you'd gone out a couple times,

338
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:57,118
我想她真的会和你做爱
I think she definitely would have had sex with you.

339
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,209
在做爱方面没有"会不会"这个说法
There's no "would" in sex.

340
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,109
你是对的, 我完全... 我完全不擅长这个, Barney
you're right, I totally... I'm just no good at this, barney.

341
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,356
我擅长成双成对 我擅长做Lily的男友
I'm good at being in a couple, I'm good at being lily's boyfriend.

342
00:16:08,357 --> 00:16:10,359
单身, 算了吧
Being single- forget it.

343
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,669
拜托, 你不能放弃
Come on, you can't give up now.

344
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,918
如果我告诉你你可以用同样的对话
What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations,

345
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,899
同样的笑话再搞定她一次 而我不来搅局
the exact same jokes only this time, you get her and I don'T.

346
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,499
不可能
That's not possible.

347
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,999
哦, 但是事实如此
Oh, but it is.

348
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,039
她正等着...
She has... wait for it...

349
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:31,719
来了...快好了...一个一样的双胞胎
Here it comes...Almost there... an identical twin.

350
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,909
好吧!
Yes!

351
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,449
姐妹并不是同一个人
A twin isn't the same person.

352
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,259
当然是
Of course it is.

353
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,679
那你觉得"一样的"是什么意思?
What do you think identical means?

354
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,519
同一个人
"Ident"- same, "ical"- person. Same person.

355
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,619
我们能一起约会
Hey, we could double date.

356
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,288
好吧
Fine.

357
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,269
不过你要发誓, 你不会再抢走这个人
But you have to promise me, you're not going to steal my new twin,

358
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,839
让我和那个老的, 被用过的人独处
and leave me with your old, used-up twin.

359
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:54,679
被用过的?
Used up?

360
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,639
他们是人类, Marshall
They're a human being, marshall.

361
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,669
然后Marshall叔叔和Barney叔叔 就约了她们姐妹俩一起约会
So uncle marshall and uncle barney went out on a double date with the twins.

362
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,619
你那里如何?
How you doing?

363
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:09,414
太棒了, 太有趣了
Great. This is so much fun.

364
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,029
我觉得我和那个女孩真的很配
And I think me and the girl are really clicking.

365
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,569
是的, 的确如此
You are, you definitely are.

366
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,695
听着, 你现在必须离开了
Listen, you're going to have to leave now.

367
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,249
我刚和他们俩谈了 我得带他们俩一起回去
I just talked with the twins, and get this, I'm going home with both of them.

368
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,138
是的
Yeah.

369
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,963
这的确发生了
That's happening.

370
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,203
你不能再次对我这么做
It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.

371
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,609
但是她们是双胞胎
But they're twins.

372
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,584
你说过单身就像是在一家糖果店
You... you said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.

373
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,465
好吧, 并不像在糖果店
Well, it's not, it's not like a candy store.

374
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,679
而是无法无天的的垃圾场
It's a lawless, postapocalyptic wasteland.

375
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,449
- 也许我是你最好的朋友... - Ted才是
- I may be your best friend... - actually ted's my best friend.

376
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,679
但是这个世界上, 男人都是自私的
But in this world, it's every hombre for himself.

377
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,219
这就是单身的真谛所在
That's what being single is.

378
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:47,454
在9年的囚禁之后...
And after nine years in captivity,

379
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:51,262
这是我能教你的关于在这个世界上生存的 最关键的一堂课
that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild.

380
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,209
现在, 抱歉...
Now, if you'll excuse me...

381
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,179
我有2个特别的复制品在等着我
I have two unique breasts and two duplicates waiting for me.

382
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,206
哦坏消息 Marshall好像吃坏东西了
oh, bad news - marshall got food poisoning.

383
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,250
- 什么? - 哦不
- What? - Oh, no.

384
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,500
太糟糕了, 我挺喜欢他的
That's too bad.I really liked him.

385
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,389
是的
Yeah.

386
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,829
我想今晚我们就三人行吧
Well, I guess we're just a threesome tonight.

387
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,369
Lily, 你在这里做什么?
Lily, what are you doing here?

388
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,002
哦, 我只是路过这里
Oh, oh, I was just walking by.

389
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:31,200
哦, 你是说纽约?
I wasn'T... oh, you mean new york?

390
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,439
我的任务结束了
My program ended.

391
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,049
很棒
It was just great.

392
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,049
很开心...其实很糟糕
Just lots of fun... it was awful.

393
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,280
这是我犯的最大的错误
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

394
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:41,379
对不起, Marshall...你好
I'm so sorry, marshall, and... hello.

395
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,699
Lily, 这个夏天是我人生中最糟糕的一次
Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.

396
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,371
我知道, 也是我人生中最糟糕的
I know. It was the worst summer of my life.

397
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,331
这是我这辈子经历的最痛苦的事情
It was the hardest thing that I've ever had to go through.

398
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,073
我们还能重新开始吗?
Can we please get back together?

399
00:18:57,932 --> 00:19:00,789
你之前和我说的那些
All that crap you said to me about,

400
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,259
"我们必须跳出小圈子找到真正的自我"
"we need to figure out who we are outside of us,

401
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,599
"我们要学会单独面对事情"
and we need to learn to do things on our own,"

402
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,054
那些东西都太伤我的心了
it broke my heart.

403
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,665
3个月前, 你伤了我的心
Three months ago, you broke my heart.

404
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,893
我们还能重新开始吗?
Can we please get back together?

405
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,723
Lily, 你之前是对的
Lily, you were right.

406
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,809
那些话也都是正确的
All that crap was right.

407
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,008
所以, 不
So, no.

408
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,409
我们不能再开始了
No, we can't get back together.

409
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,069
我们不应该再开始了
We shouldn'T.

410
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,989
至少, 现在不行
At least, not right now.

411
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,784
好吧
Okay.

412
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,605
是的
Yeah.

413
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,839
我们还能再见面吗?
Well... will we still see each other?

414
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,669
当然
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,199
我想是的
I think so.

416
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,579
我不知道
I don't know.

417
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:04,490
这些对我来说都是新的
This is all really new to me.

418
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,641
我刚从一段长恋情中走出来
I just got out of a long relationship.

419
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,449
我喜欢你的头发
I like your hair.

420
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,469
谢谢
Thanks.

421
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,591
我那个时候觉得新的城市, 新的颜色...
I figured new city, a different color...

422
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,961
那里还有匹萨 那是我吃过的最差的匹萨


423
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,239
我真高兴回到了纽约


424
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,699
是呀


425
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,489
一切都由你决定...
To even begin to make things up to you...

426
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,039
事实上你能帮我做一点事情
actually there may be something that you can do for me,

427
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,489
但是你不要问我为什么
but you can never ever ask me why.

428
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,869
然后我被提升做了经理助理...
So then I was promoted to assistant mnage-er...

429
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,119
经理...我为什么要这么做?
manager- why do I keep doing that?

430
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,399
Lily?
Lily?

431
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,903
你害我染上衣原体病, 你个混蛋
You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

432
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,099
我说到哪里了?
So where was I?

433
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,901
哦是的, 经历助理, 我又做了一次
Ah, yes, assistant mnage-er... I did it again.

434
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:17,229
我简直无法相信
I can't believe it.

435
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,348
你害我双胞胎妹妹得了衣原体病
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.

436
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,589
你个畜生!
You slime!

437
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,059
等等, 我会魔法
Wha... wait, I know magic.

438
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,241
干的好, Eriksen
Well, played, eriksen.

439
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,827
干的好
Well played.
