00:00:02,162 --> 00:00:04,225
This town
was my home once.

00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:07,506
Our community is under attack.
They're declaring war on us.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:09,358
I die, all because
of your vow,

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:10,759
always and forever.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,894
If you have come here
seeking revenge, don't...

7
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:13,062
Oh, I'll have
my revenge.

8
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:14,137
I'm Jackson.

9
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:15,515
You're the wolf
who's been watching me.

10
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,283
Jackson: Marcel had us
cursed by a witch.

11
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:20,008
You and I are gonna
have a little chat.

12
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,019
You're my family.

13
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,371
Rebekah: My brother
expects my loyalty

14
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:23,873
as he has
for 1,000 years.

15
00:00:23,874 --> 00:00:26,024
Marcel: Klaus will never
stop trying to control you.

16
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,576
All his life,
there's only ever been

17
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:29,211
one man he has
truly feared...

18
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:30,296
My father Mikael.

19
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,297
All we need
is a witch

20
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,748
who can help us
find him.

21
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:33,749
That's how I'm going
to have my revenge,

22
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,867
by showing you
her betrayal.

23
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,803
It was my idea
to summon Mikael.

24
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,588
Uhhaah!

25
00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:42,474
Both of you, run as far
and as fast as you can.

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,781
Well, this is a first...

28
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:10,169
Werewolves, vampires,
witches, and dirty cops,

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,290
all happy as clams
and drunk as stoats.

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,542
You got to love
this city.

31
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,260
To a new era
of collaboration

32
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:20,704
in the face
of prohibition.

33
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,765
To your docks,
their booze,

34
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:25,518
and our theaters
to hide it under.

35
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,504
You're welcome, boys.

36
00:01:33,192 --> 00:01:35,444
Now I shall have
to think of a way

37
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,930
to thank you
personally

38
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,018
in a manner befitting
a werewolf queen.

39
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,952
Catch you
on the dance floor.

40
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:48,356
Who would have
thought it possible...

41
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:50,277
The unification
of New Orleans?

42
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,196
We did it, brother.

43
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,247
Oh, certainly, we worked
together, Niklaus,

44
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,117
but this vision...

45
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:01,302
This was all you.

46
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,921
This was all you.

49
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:22,690
Please.

50
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,861
Why did you call me?

51
00:02:25,862 --> 00:02:27,145
Have you found a way
to help my uncle?

52
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,864
I can try, but first,
I need your help.

53
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,533
I don't have time
for games, Elijah.

54
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,751
The hex on him is getting worse
by the day.

55
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:33,786
My brother has
a mystical torture device

56
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,287
buried in his chest,

57
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,540
and the mother of his child
is inexplicably missing.

58
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,758
So, I can assure you,
I have no time

59
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,661
to play any games,
either.

60
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:46,265
What do you
need me to do?

61
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,018
Cami: The dagger the witch
gave me is inside of him?

62
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,769
And every second
it remains

63
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,689
causes Niklaus
untold suffering.

64
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,940
Who stabbed him?

65
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,892
I did,

66
00:02:56,893 --> 00:02:59,862
and now I intend
to remove it.

67
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,973
You might want
to take a step back.

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,103
Why am I here?

69
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:08,353
Because of all the people
that could be here,

70
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,982
you're probably the only one he
wouldn't immediately slaughter.

71
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,573
Mm...

72
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:22,325
Also, he speaks of you

73
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,911
with what is
a rare degree...

74
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:27,256
For him, at least...
Of respect.

75
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:30,509
I can see you challenge him
to see himself and others

76
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,511
in a new light...

77
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,230
Ugh...

78
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:35,880
Ahh...

79
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:39,467
A wonderful skill that I shall
be counting on very shortly.

80
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:45,101
You see, Niklaus
will be weak as he recovers.

81
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:49,778
So watch over him and
feed him if you would

82
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:53,115
but slowly, please,
and from your wrist.

83
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,442
Don't you guys have bags
of blood in storage?

84
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,254
We do, but your blood
is laced with vervain.

85
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:00,574
So it will burn him.
He'll ingest it slower.

86
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:02,741
Perhaps you could use
the time constructively,

87
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,996
persuade him not to
murder his baby sister.

88
00:04:08,213 --> 00:04:10,950
Niklaus...

89
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,686
It was not my desire
to bring you pain,

90
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:16,939
but I will not
see you hurt Rebekah.

91
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,633
Now, I fear Sabine

92
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,976
may be making
a final move against us.

93
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:24,387
I intend to find her
and to end this.

94
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,433
Elijah...

95
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:35,341
You will pay

96
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,694
for this.

97
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,116
Sabine: So what's
this, payback?

98
00:04:45,117 --> 00:04:46,552
Look. I'm sorry
I tricked you.

99
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,886
I wasn't after you.

100
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,005
Eve: What, and we were
just collateral damage?

101
00:04:50,006 --> 00:04:51,807
You almost burned her
and Jackson alive

102
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,335
in that plantation fire.

103
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:56,962
[Gunshot]
Careful, Sabine,

104
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,732
or Celeste or whatever
you like to call yourself.

105
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,676
Sudden moves make me
jumpy and homicidal.

106
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,354
What, you're gonna
kill me, honey?

107
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,406
No. I know better.

108
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,351
See, I know
all about you.

109
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:11,026
I know that you like
to off yourself

110
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,911
and then jump into
other people's bodies.

111
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,030
Well, that's not
gonna happen here.

112
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,249
I know I can't kill you,
but try hexing me,

113
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,918
and my friend Eve here
will kneecap you.

114
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,781
Go for her, and then, well,
I'll really make it hurt.

115
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:25,742
So what do you want?

116
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,325
Back in the nineties,
you inhabited

117
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:29,094
a witch named
Brynne Deveraux,

118
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,630
remember?

119
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:35,267
Marcel had her, you,

120
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,369
put a curse on a lot
of werewolves

121
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,471
so they'd only turn
human on a full moon.

122
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,691
I see.

123
00:05:42,692 --> 00:05:44,276
Yes. That was me.

124
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,362
Let me guess.
You want revenge.

125
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:48,807
I want you
to undo the curse.

126
00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:53,143
Wow, things I never
thought I'd be doing...

127

Feeding a vampire.

I'm really cool
right now.

Mm.
Ah! Slow down.

131
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,217
Ok. Doesn't
the vervain burn?

132
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:11,162
Ah... ah...

133
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:14,356
As you may have yet
to realize, Cami,

134
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:17,959
the line between
what brings us pain

135
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,145
and what sustains us
is far thinner

136
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,048
than one imagines.

137
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,483
You talking about
my blood or your need

138
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,268
to hunt down the people
you love most?

00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,072
I'm too weak for one
of your talks right now.

00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:35,327
She's your sister.
How can you hate her?

141
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,580
Because she has done
what no one else

142
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:42,935
has managed to do to
me for 1,000 years...

a pair.

this opportunity

to draw attention
to two people

who have been sneaking around
behind my back together.

As we move into a new era,

154
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:32,994
we require more
progressive attitudes to match.

155
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:37,890
So... to my loving sister

156
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:43,011
and my right-hand man
and best friend Marcel,

157
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:46,549
may they find joy
in each other.

to run again,

would be broken,

to run anymore.

180
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,895
Oh, I'm not so sure
about that.

181
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:31,569
Rebekah: Can you believe
we're sitting out here

182
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,789
in the open
bold as brass?

183
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,867
No. Ah, it feels
like heaven.

184
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,661
You know, it's been
over 6 months

185
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,957
since Genevieve summoned
my father, and nothing.

186
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:44,542
Her spell
must have failed.

187
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:48,796
Hey, if so,
we dodged a bullet.

188
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,358
Right.

189
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,759
I am off to speak

190
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,761
at the women's temperance
society meeting

191
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,096
to make sure the wives
of this city

192
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,282
urge their husbands
not to drink.

193
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,618
Aren't you all in
the booze biz now?

194
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,270
Yes, but the more
one tells you

195
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,707
you can't have something,
the more you crave it

196
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,743
at all costs.

197
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,210
Ha ha ha!

198
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,929
He'll chase us
to the ends of the earth,

199
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:34,349
and he'll find us.

200
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,011
No one can hide
forever,

201
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,971
especially not from
an angry Mikaelson.

202
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,190
Then we go through
with the plan.

203
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,359
There's only one way
that we'll truly be able

204
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,145
to hide from Klaus
forever.

205
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,814
They'll need
a cloaking spell,

206
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,017
and for that,
they'll need a witch.

207
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,820
Davina
is our one shot.

208
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,354
If we go back
and get her...

209
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:56,455
It's a suicide
mission.

210
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,673
It's our only hope.

211
00:10:57,674 --> 00:10:59,341
We resurrect her,
take her with us,

212
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,342
and get out of town.

213
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,376
Then she can hide us
from Klaus

214
00:11:01,377 --> 00:11:02,827
so he'll never
find us.

215
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,846
We don't even know the right witch
to kill to bring her back.

216
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:06,124
Then we'll
kill them all.

217
00:11:06,549 --> 00:11:08,100
Just kill the 3 witches
that brought

218
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,502
the mighty Klaus Mikaelson
to his knees, no big deal.

219
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,187
Look. Unless you want
to spend eternity

220
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,505
looking over
your shoulder,

221
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,381
there's only one thing
that we can do.

222
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:18,928
There's only one
place they can go...

223
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,068
Home.

224
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,196
[Chanting in foreign language]

225
00:11:39,311 --> 00:11:41,313
[Footsteps]

226
00:11:41,314 --> 00:11:43,448
When order is restored,

227
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:45,517
your kind won't
be allowed in here.

228
00:11:45,518 --> 00:11:48,124
Well, fortunately, that
day has not yet come.

229
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,688
I need to find
Sabine.

230
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:50,855
I believe she's
taken someone

231
00:11:50,856 --> 00:11:52,523
very important
to me.

232
00:11:52,524 --> 00:11:55,760
And you thought
I'd help you?

233
00:11:55,761 --> 00:11:58,013
Sabine is one of us,

234
00:11:58,014 --> 00:11:59,881
committed to the rise
of the witches.

235
00:11:59,882 --> 00:12:01,283
The only thing Sabine
is committed to

236
00:12:01,284 --> 00:12:03,346
is the destruction
of my family.

237
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,886
And that would be
a bad thing why?

238
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:06,059
Like your mother,

239
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:08,423
my mother
was also a witch,

240
00:12:08,424 --> 00:12:09,591
a very
powerful witch.

241
00:12:09,592 --> 00:12:11,259
In fact, because
of my family,

242
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,732
her power now flows
through your veins.

243
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,231
Now, once Sabine
manipulates

244
00:12:16,232 --> 00:12:17,548
those around her,
she will do

245
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:18,817
what she has
always done.

246
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:20,268
She will jump
into another body

247
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:21,903
and disappear,

248
00:12:21,904 --> 00:12:24,951
leaving your witches
powerless.

249
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,557
No. She has
the faith.

250
00:12:26,558 --> 00:12:28,443
She will see
our power restored.

251
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:31,082
There's a way of
guaranteeing this.

252
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,447
I'll also secure
the safety

253
00:12:32,448 --> 00:12:34,796
of yourself
and your kind.

254
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:38,464
Here. This is from
my mother's grimoire.

255
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,871
Celeste used
a similar spell

256
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:41,923
to body jump.

257
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,425
If what Sabine says
is true,

258
00:12:43,426 --> 00:12:44,793
when she sacrifices
herself,

259
00:12:44,794 --> 00:12:46,211
all of her power
will flow

260
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:47,412
back into the earth.

261
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:50,081
However,
if she has lied

262
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,772
and tries to take
another body,

263
00:12:53,252 --> 00:12:55,270
this spell
will deliver her

264
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:57,443
to a very different
destination.

265
00:12:58,974 --> 00:13:03,408
Now please
locate Sabine.

266
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,994
Rebekah:
Papa Tunde is dead.

267
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,450
That leaves Sabine,

268
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:09,534
Bastianna,
and Genevieve.

269
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:10,785
We want to kill
them all,

270
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:12,170
and as soon
as Davina rises,

271
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,488
we take her with us.

272
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:15,169
Look. We have
one shot at this,

273
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,492
and I know our
chances of success

274
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:20,091
are sweet bugger all,
but we've got to do it.

275
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,548
So please, one stray
dog to another,

276
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:25,138
help us.

277
00:13:25,617 --> 00:13:27,452
Not many go up against
those odds

278
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:30,621
and live to tell
the story.

279
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:32,556
Have you?

280
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:36,274
I'm still standing
here, aren't I?

281
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:41,028
I've gone up against
the worst of them all.

282
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:49,744
You're a lucky man.

283
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,577
Men search the world over
for a woman like her.

284
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,913
Well, she's taken,
friend.

285
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,115
Oh, I can see that.

286
00:13:57,116 --> 00:13:58,750
It's just that she
reminds me so much

287
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,036
of my departed wife
as a girl.

288
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:02,704
See, I've been traveling
for such a long time

289
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:05,707
that it's a blessing
to see a familiar soul

290
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:08,043
so far from home.

291
00:14:08,044 --> 00:14:11,142
I'm sorry
for your loss.

292
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:14,854
Here's to old faces
in new places.

293
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,473
I've been in New Orleans
for a day,

294
00:14:21,474 --> 00:14:23,224
and I find it to be
quite surprising.

295
00:14:23,225 --> 00:14:26,194
Had I known of its charm
and fascinating denizens,

296
00:14:26,195 --> 00:14:28,947
I would have come
ages ago.

297
00:14:28,948 --> 00:14:30,515
Don't supposed
I have to thank you

298
00:14:30,516 --> 00:14:33,581
for extending
this invitation.

299
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:36,905
Who are

300
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:40,291
oh, you're
a smart man.

301
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,840
I think you know.

302
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm an intelligent
man myself,

303
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,890
so have a seat.

304
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,435
Let me tell you
what I learned

305
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:58,397
about you this afternoon,
Marcel Gerard.

306
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,816
You chafe under the control
of my son Niklaus

307
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,799
and would do just about
anything to get rid if him,

308
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,435
even call the one man
on this earth

309
00:15:07,436 --> 00:15:09,240
who hates him
more than you do,

310
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,473
but I couldn't understand
what you hoped to gain...

311
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,037
Rule of this city?

312
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,327
Well, as I said,
New Orleans has its charms,

313
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:19,114
but to call me...

314
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,044
The one they call
the destroyer,

315
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,463
the one who's
burnt cities

316
00:15:24,464 --> 00:15:26,254
far more charming
to the ground

317
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:28,219
in pursuit
of his children...

318
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,221
But now I see.

319
00:15:30,742 --> 00:15:34,345
You did it for love,
the love of my daughter.

320
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:36,581
Don't you dare
touch her.

321
00:15:36,582 --> 00:15:39,934
Mm, so I'm going
to make you a promise.

322
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,636
I won't hurt Rebekah...

323
00:15:41,637 --> 00:15:44,105
Truth be told, she was
always my favorite...

324
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:47,029
And this city,
you can have it,

325
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,695
but first,
you must tell me

326
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:53,781
where to find my son.

327
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:55,371
Uh...

328
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,036
You're
still weak.

329
00:15:58,037 --> 00:16:01,878
I'm still hungry.

330
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,579
There's a fresh
blood supply

331
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,779
in the kitchen.

332
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,131
You won't make it
that far.

333
00:16:10,132 --> 00:16:12,261
So be a good little boy
and get back into bed.

334
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,835
If I had a quid
for every time

335
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,637
a woman has tried
that line on me...

336
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,805
You'd have, like,
no money.

337
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:19,841
I beg to differ.

338
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,476
Some women
actually find me

339
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:23,178
quite charming.

340
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:25,929
Uh! Ha ha ha!

341
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:32,020
Ha ha ha!

342
00:16:32,021 --> 00:16:34,410
Sleeping with
the enemy, I see.

343
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,412
I'm the ally now,
darling.

344
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:38,743
Well, indeed.

345
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:41,499
Klaus: Oh, and as a
gesture of goodwill

346
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,198
from our old enemy,

347
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,916
tickets to
tonight's opera...

348
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,334
"Les huguenots."

349
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,382
They have a soprano
to die for.

350
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,005
I'll introduce you
if you promise not to eat her.

351
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:53,177
Oh, Lana,

352
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,710
a good soprano
is never dinner.

353
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,517
Tell Rebekah
to bring Marcel.

354
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,698
Feel free
to tell her now,

355
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,667
big brother.

356
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,302
I have some business
I need to discuss

357
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:06,136
with our new ally.

358
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,197
Why am I not surprised
you like opera?

359
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,946
I always had a
particular soft spot

360
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,898
for "les huguenots."

361
00:17:16,899 --> 00:17:19,200
I like the story.

362
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:22,687
It was a tale
of forbidden love,

363
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:26,574
a "Romeo and Juliet"
of sorts.

364
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:30,295
On the day
they are to marry,

365
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,297
family and
long-festering hatred

366
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,051
intervene.

367
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,533
Thousands are massacred.

368
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,919
A father even kills
his own child

369
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,555
in the final act.

370
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:44,647
I can almost
appreciate the irony.

371
00:17:50,064 --> 00:17:52,149
Here.

372
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,903
It's herbs
ground into paste.

373
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:58,072
It'll act as a conduit
for the spell.

374
00:17:58,073 --> 00:17:59,073
On the next
full moon,

375
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,391
your people
become human.

376
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:02,454
Feed it to them, the
curse will be broken.

377
00:18:02,455 --> 00:18:04,162
Great way to poison us
all at once.

378
00:18:04,163 --> 00:18:05,780
Look. I know you
have no reason

379
00:18:05,781 --> 00:18:08,583
to trust me,
but, Hayley,

380
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:11,085
I actually like you.

381
00:18:11,086 --> 00:18:13,338
I was you,
caring for Elijah

382
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:15,089
when he cared more
for his brother,

383
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,574
and I ended up dead.

384
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:18,556
So did a lot
of others.

385
00:18:18,961 --> 00:18:20,595
This, call it a chance
for me to give you

386
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,630
what I was too in love
to give myself.

387
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:24,182
It's a chance
to free yourself

388
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,550
from The Originals.

389
00:18:25,551 --> 00:18:27,313
You believe her?

390
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,604
[Growls]

391
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,923
Elijah: Whatever she's
promised you, it's a lie.

392
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:34,609
Elijah, it's ok.
I'm ok.

393
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,697
She cannot
be trusted.

394
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,429
She's the only one
that can help my pack.

395
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,847
Do you have any idea
what she has done

396
00:18:39,848 --> 00:18:41,316
to our family?

397
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,568
I know you want revenge,
and come the next full moon,

398
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:46,270
when I'm sure her cure
works, she's all yours.

399
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,773
Are you suggesting
that we hold her,

400
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:52,943
her, captive
for an entire month?

401
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:54,508
It would take
an army.

402
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,634
And I've got one.

403
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,719
[Howls]

404
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,084
[Distant howling]

405
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,811
So help me
or get out of my way.

406
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,018
You tricked her.

407
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,753
It's no trick.

408
00:19:21,754 --> 00:19:24,022
You're holding the cure for
Hayley's clan in your hand.

409
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,191
If her wolves take that elixir,
the curse is no more.

410
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:27,414
They're free.

411
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,477
You condemned her people
to decades of agony,

412
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,146
and now you just
break the curse

413
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:32,397
without so much
as a whimper.

414
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:34,766
Why?

415
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:37,869
Because it's the best thing
I could do for her

416
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,788
and it's the worst
possible thing

417
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:41,706
I could do to you.

418
00:19:41,707 --> 00:19:43,158
What are you saying?

419
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:44,376
That, no matter
what happens now,

420
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:45,627
you've lost her.

421
00:19:45,628 --> 00:19:47,712
You destroy that jar,
you kill me,

422
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:48,964
Hayley will hate you

423
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:51,666
for snatching
her family from her.

424
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:53,899
Now, if you
give her the jar,

425
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,337
we both know that
she'll leave you

426
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:57,138
in the end to be
with them,

427
00:19:57,139 --> 00:19:58,974
and I know that as long
as she's alive

428
00:19:58,975 --> 00:20:01,226
and happy and
fulfilled in ways

429
00:20:01,227 --> 00:20:04,479
that you can't
even imagine,

430
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,705
then I get
my revenge.

431
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,800
So you decide...
Give her everything

432
00:20:08,801 --> 00:20:10,518
she ever wanted
and lose her

433
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,422
or deny it, see
what happens then.

434
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:21,846
Where's the third one...
Sabine?

435
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:23,214
I asked to meet
with all 3 of you.

436
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:24,683
Our meeting you at all
is a courtesy

437
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:26,835
for your being a friend
to witches in the past,

438
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:29,393
but courtesy
has its limits.

439
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,007
Now, you said you
had information

440
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:33,482
of interest to us.

441
00:20:34,774 --> 00:20:36,819
Rebekah and Marcel
are back.

442
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,575
They came for Davina,
and they think

443
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:41,278
that they can get her if
they kill all 3 of you.

444
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:43,163
Now look.

445
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,115
I can lead you
straight to them,

446
00:20:45,116 --> 00:20:47,244
but there's something
I want in return.

447
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,832
And what's that?

448
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,376
Your life.

449
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:56,821
[Chanting]

450
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,501
[Chanting]

451
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:16,317
Follow me, and I'll turn
you both into ash.

452
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:21,162
Forget her.
We'll get her later.

453
00:21:21,163 --> 00:21:23,381
Marcel, all we have is
the element of surprise,

454
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,050
and we have lost it.

455
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,351
If we don't
leave now,

456
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,686
there will be
no one to save us.

457
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,554
I already
failed Davina once.

458
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,415
I'm not leaving
her behind.

459
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:40,649
Not sure that helps.

460
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,635
Not sure it doesn't.

461
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:46,538
You want to self-medicate
your self-pity, fine.

462
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,014
Better scotch than my blood,
no matter what Elijah says.

463
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:51,266
Don't speak to me
of Elijah.

464
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,879
He loves you.
Yes.

465
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,430
He does,
and he proves it

466
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:58,016
time and again,
even when my father

467
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:00,184
enlisted him
to kill me.

468
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,607
"Uguenots".

469
00:22:05,608 --> 00:22:08,692
Saw it in venice,
marvelous production.

470
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:12,287
You.
It's all right, son.

471
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:13,791
I just want to talk.

472
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,018
You mercilessly
hunt us for centuries.

473
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:18,537
You laid waste
to half of Europe.

474
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,297
Now you simply
wish to talk?

475
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:24,292
It was your bastard
brother I hunted,

476
00:22:24,293 --> 00:22:27,177
not you, never you.

477
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:28,797
You're my blood,

478
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,933
one that I'd be
proud to call son.

479
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,600
So I came here
to give you a chance

480
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:37,722
to help me put down
that whelp for good.

481
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,692
Waah! Aah!

482
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,432
Do you really
not know me?

483
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,734
Do you think
I could or would

484
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:52,720
believe in anything
that you say?

485
00:22:52,721 --> 00:22:54,990
If you honestly believe
that I would betray

486
00:22:54,991 --> 00:22:59,160
my own brother
for you,

487
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:03,297
you're a fool
without equal.

488
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,900
I'll forgive you your
sentimental affections

489
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,052
for the thing
you call brother,

490
00:23:09,053 --> 00:23:12,907
but you need to realize,
as I did when I learned

491
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:17,128
his mother had lain
with a beast to beget him,

492
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:21,349
Niklaus
is an abomination.

493
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,102
You do not talk
to abominations.

494
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:26,805
You do not reason with them.

495
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:32,536
Do not try to change them.
You erase them.

496
00:23:32,945 --> 00:23:36,781
So, yes, I am asking you

497
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,418
to help me kill
your brother.

498
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:43,905
You keep saying kill,
but you're immortal.

499
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:45,206
You can't be killed.

500
00:23:45,207 --> 00:23:47,292
Oh, but we can, luv,

501
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,627
and my father
was the only one

502
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,778
with the means
to do it...

503
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:54,132
A white oak stake
fashioned by my father

504
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,617
to take from us
the very thing

505
00:23:55,618 --> 00:23:57,502
he forced
upon us all...

506
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:00,504
Our immortality.

507
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,230
Stand with me

508
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,232
or fall with him.

509
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,618
Choose, son.

510
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:23,862
I will always...

511
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,997
Choose him.

512
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,008
Fine.

513
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:35,206
Klaus, voice-over: Elijah
has always carried guilt

514
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:38,760
for that night for not
stopping our father.

515
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,978
I told him not
to blame himself.

516
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,497
When your father
wants to kill you,

517
00:24:42,498 --> 00:24:45,050
he wants
to kill you,

518
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:48,520
nothing you can do
about it.

519
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:53,191
[Cell phone vibrates]

520
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:55,360
Oh, I hate to be
a know-it-all.

521
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:56,895
My sister
and her lover

522
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,455
have been spotted
in town.

523
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,458
So story time endeth
here, I'm afraid.

524
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:07,798
What is that?

525
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,136
A white oak stake,
my own special version,

526
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,245
and, unlike my father's,

527
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:17,349
this one
cannot be destroyed.

528
00:25:29,377 --> 00:25:31,195
What are you doing?

529
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,798
Well, if you
have to ask,

530
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:36,367
you obviously haven't
been paying attention.

531
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:38,252
I'm going to kill
my sister,

532
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:39,721
but first, I needed
some sustenance

533
00:25:39,722 --> 00:25:41,472
with a little less
vervain in it,

534
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:42,664
no offense.

535
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,875
When Davina showed me
all you did to me,

536
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,463
all you took from me,
I wanted to kill you.

537
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,230
I even thought about
burying that blade in you

538
00:25:49,231 --> 00:25:51,065
like the witches
asked me to, but I didn't.

539
00:25:51,066 --> 00:25:52,266
I stopped. I thought.

540
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,435
I weighed the good
I see in you

541
00:25:54,436 --> 00:25:56,738
versus the horrible things
I know you've done,

542
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,439
and I realized
if I hurt you,

543
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,391
I'd be filled
with a terrible regret.

544
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,743
You will, too,
if you hurt your sister,

545
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,244
your sister, Klaus.

546
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:04,612
As a person who has
lost a sibling,

547
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,498
who has felt that pain,
you won't survive

548
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,833
if you're the one
who kills her.

549
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:10,001
I'll tell you
what I almost

550
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,502
didn't survive,
luv...

551
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,805
My sister bringing
the most vile creature

552
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,123
ever to have
walked the earth

553
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:16,340
down upon me.

554
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,843
Yes, your father,
but by hunting Rebekah

555
00:26:18,844 --> 00:26:20,461
and Marcel down
to the ends of the earth,

556
00:26:20,462 --> 00:26:24,374
by terrorizing them the way
you yourself were terrorized...

557
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,135
Don't become
your father.

558
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:29,520
I've been called
every shade of monster,

559
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:31,105
but that's new.

560
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:32,807
My father?

561
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,759
Mikael
was the monster

562
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,195
monsters
were afraid of.

563
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,722
Come.
Let me show you.

564
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:47,467
You came back.

565
00:26:47,468 --> 00:26:48,690
I'll always
come back.

566
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,111
Take it.

567
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:56,323
It will work.

568
00:27:08,588 --> 00:27:11,838
Eve and I will round up as many
of our people as we can.

569
00:27:12,343 --> 00:27:16,468
Come full moon, I can
finally free my family.

570
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,564
Hayley...

571
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,373
I wonder if they
have any idea

572
00:27:43,374 --> 00:27:44,955
how lucky they are
to have you.

573
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:51,044
Mm.

574
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:05,557
That was touching,

575
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,477
such a chaste,
little kiss.

576
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,401
The Elijah I knew
was never so meek.

577
00:28:11,402 --> 00:28:15,655
Well, the Celeste I knew
was never so cruel.

578
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:17,273
What is it that you want?
What's your endgame?

579
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:20,076
Oh, this game
never ends, Elijah.

580
00:28:20,077 --> 00:28:22,157
We're both immortal,
you know.

581
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:24,197
Then what's the point
if you can't possibly win?

582
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:26,416
But I have.

583
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,451
You just
lost the girl,

584
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:30,003
the girl you never
made a move on

585
00:28:30,004 --> 00:28:31,588
because you were
so desperate

586
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,673
to save your family,

587
00:28:33,674 --> 00:28:35,458
and now your family
lies in ruins.

588
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:38,011
My family, despite
all that you have done,

589
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:39,633
will heal in time.

590
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,631
If you had
the time, maybe,

591
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:43,433
but you really think
Rebekah ran far

592
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:46,252
and fast from here?
I bet she didn't.

593
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,477
She's long gone.
Is she?

594
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:53,480
She's with Marcel.

595
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,111
Now, Marcel
loves Davina.

596
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:56,980
Davina is dead, but
she could come back

597
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:58,695
under the right
circumstances.

598
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,316
You wouldn't dare.

599
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:01,768
If you hadn't been
so worried about Hayley,

600
00:29:01,769 --> 00:29:03,653
you might have
figured it out sooner,

601
00:29:03,654 --> 00:29:04,954
but you know who did
have the time

602
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:06,239
to think about it?

603
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,491
Your brother.

604
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:11,161
I wonder
what he'll do.

605
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,418
Heh. Do it.

606
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:21,221
You know
your city's history,

607
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:23,123
that night in 1919
when the opera house

608
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:25,222
burned down
on this very spot?

609
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:27,641
That was my father
at his worst.

610
00:29:33,183 --> 00:29:36,569
Klaus: Well, this is
off to a bad start.

611
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,571
Your first big date
together in public

612
00:29:38,572 --> 00:29:39,906
after I gave you
my blessing,

613
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:41,891
and he stood you up.

614
00:29:41,892 --> 00:29:43,993
Something must
have delayed him.

615
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,695
Or, now that
your elicit affair

616
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,146
is out in the open,
he finds

617
00:29:47,147 --> 00:29:49,365
the whole relationship
a tad lackluster

618
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:51,367
and has run off to
havana with a showgirl.

619
00:29:51,368 --> 00:29:54,668
Don't be such a toerag.
I'm going to check the lobby.

620
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,756
See if you can't
find our brother

621
00:29:56,757 --> 00:29:58,208
while you're there.

622
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:04,208
The curtain
is about to go up.

623
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:17,393
I would advise against
trying to flee, boy.

624
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:19,691
I can drive this
into your heart

625
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,498
before you
can even think

626
00:30:21,499 --> 00:30:24,184
of getting
to your feet,

627
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:28,368
and I don't want you
to die... yet.

628
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:30,704

"Father"? Ha ha!

629
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,525

to that word

after all
these years,

a bastard desperate
for a daddy?

632
00:30:38,582 --> 00:30:40,383
I wonder if your
real father would be

633
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,035
as embarrassed
as I was of you

634
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:45,505
before I discovered
you were not mine.

635
00:30:45,506 --> 00:30:48,892
Most likely.

636
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:52,684
Oh, oh. Uh-uh.
Easy now, boy.

637
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,599
Don't worry.

638
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,985
Death will come,
but we need to have

639
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:01,905
a little chat
before you

640
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:04,157
shuffle off
your immortal coil.

641
00:31:04,158 --> 00:31:05,775
Any words we have
for each other

642
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,244
have been spoken
long ago,

643
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:11,247
but know this.

of your affection.

I will die knowing
my hatred for you was just.

647
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,718
I will fall proud of all
I have achieved here.

648

So... Mikael...

649
00:31:31,752 --> 00:31:34,804
If you're going
to kill me,

remain unsaid.

653

For instance,
you were right

654
00:31:42,863 --> 00:31:44,280
to be proud of your
achievement here.

655
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:47,650
As I walked the streets,
your name was spoken of

in reverent tones
by the city's finest.

657
00:31:49,987 --> 00:31:52,956
So after I kill you,

658
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,958
I will remain here
in New Orleans

who remembers you

It's a myth, Elijah,
a myth I died for.

713
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:05,153
And yet here
you stand alive...

714
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:07,539
For now.

715
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,857
Is that a threat?

716
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,650
Oh, there's always
another pretty,

717
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:14,152
young body
for me to jump into.

718
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:17,132
From now on,
every time you feel

719
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,634
a connection to a woman,
you'll be forced

720
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:20,452
to wonder
if it's me.

721
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:21,995
You'll trust no one

722
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:26,107
and spend the rest
of eternity alone.

723
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:32,013
Ha ha ha!

724
00:35:32,014 --> 00:35:33,214
Ha ha ha!

725
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:35,233
I'm afraid
you're trapped.

726
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,233
Boundary spell.

727
00:35:36,686 --> 00:35:38,453
The Originals can enter,
but they can't leave.

728
00:35:38,454 --> 00:35:40,188
You wouldn't.

729
00:35:40,189 --> 00:35:43,099
I would, and I did.

730
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:58,389
I got you, D.
I got you.

731
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:15,607
It's a trap.

732
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,392
Run. Get Davina
out of here.

733
00:36:17,393 --> 00:36:18,944
I'm not leaving
you behind.

734
00:36:18,945 --> 00:36:20,551
You must.

735
00:36:20,552 --> 00:36:22,748
I will not
leave you behind.

736
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,889
I swear I will
join you.

737
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,435
Go. Get Davina
someplace safe.

738
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:37,429
Sabine: Don't worry.
It's a lunar spell.

739
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,414
You'll be free by
the next moonrise.

740
00:36:39,415 --> 00:36:42,434
My guess is,

741
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:45,120
your sister won't
last that long.

742
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:54,780
Ah, while
this body has been

743
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,232
a hell of a lot of fun,
I do think it's time

744
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,468
I find someone else
to play in, don't you?

745
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:02,935
[Coughing]

746
00:37:10,212 --> 00:37:11,604
[Coughing stops]

747
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:23,116
You were right.

748
00:37:35,303 --> 00:37:37,422
[Speaking
foreign language]

749
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,223
[Gasps]

750
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:01,413
Hello, Celeste.

751
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,614
How is this
possible?

752
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:05,531
Monique Deveraux and I
had a little wager

753
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:07,744
regarding your ability
to keep a promise.

754
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:10,997
It appears I won.

755
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:16,228
You were so consumed
with my downfall,

756
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:19,981
that you lost the trust
of one of your own.

757
00:38:19,982 --> 00:38:22,799
Non.

758
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,717
Mon cheri, non.

759
00:38:24,718 --> 00:38:27,678
Tout est possible.

760
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,858
Ce n'est pas fini.

761
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:32,352
Aah!
Desole.

762
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,065
Aah!

763
00:39:06,831 --> 00:39:08,750
[Moaning]

764
00:39:08,751 --> 00:39:11,152
Davina, you're ok.

765
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,821
You're safe now.
You hear me? You're safe.

766
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,937
I won't let anyone
hurt you, ok?

767
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:27,238
Rebekah!

768
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,386
Rebekah!

769
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:33,997
Cherish the breath
in your lungs!

770
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:36,394
It'll be your last.

771
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:40,877
The final act of
le grand guignol is upon us!

772
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:44,018
Where are my players?

773
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,187
Enough running, children!

774
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:48,926
Step out of the shadows

775
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:52,076
so we can finish
this tale of sorrows.

776
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:54,361
He's coming.

777
00:39:59,834 --> 00:40:02,442
All right.
Come on, sister.

778
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:09,142
Marcel.

779
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,953
He's gone,
sister.

780
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:18,069
No. No.

781
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,687
Elijah: Both of you
must flee the city.

782
00:40:19,688 --> 00:40:21,239
I'll hold him off,
Niklaus.

783
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,524
No.

784
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:25,076
We fight him
together.

785
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:26,778
Elijah:
We cannot fight him.

786
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:28,196
All we can do is do
what we've done.

787
00:40:28,197 --> 00:40:29,781
We deceive him.
We lead him astray.

788
00:40:29,782 --> 00:40:31,804
Now, I can do that
as well as anyone.

789
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:34,402
You take her
far away from here.

790
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,516
I'll follow you.

791
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,852
No, Elijah. You can't.
You can't, Elijah.

792
00:40:39,853 --> 00:40:42,543
This is just...
This is my fault.

793
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:47,026
No. This is my fault,
Rebekah.

794
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:50,852
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry.

795
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:51,903
Marcel...

796
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:53,086
[Alarm bell ringing]

797
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,208
I thought we'd found
a home here.

798
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,797
Niklaus, please.

799
00:41:06,368 --> 00:41:08,118
Sister, come.

800
00:41:11,205 --> 00:41:13,471
You must leave. Go.

801
00:41:15,994 --> 00:41:17,642
Leave!

802
00:41:29,007 --> 00:41:31,058
Elijah?

803
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:35,847
What are you
doing here?

804
00:41:35,848 --> 00:41:37,148
Rebekah,
you should be

805
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:39,245
on the other side
of the world by now.

806
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,958
You and I both know that
wouldn't have been far enough.

807
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:46,087
Get away from her!

808
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,551
She's mine.

809
