1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,328
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
DAVlNA: Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,870
这座城市曾经是我的家
我要夺回来
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,339
我希望你帮我夺回纽奥良
让他们眼睁睁看着
I want you to help take New Orleans
from under all of their noses,

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,741
而且我有一个内应
and I have someone on the inside.

5
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:15,175
我需要你的帮助
SOPHlE: I need something from you

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,975
好让女巫们完成收获祭
so that the witches
can complete the Harvest.

7
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,710
我需要一名强大女巫的遗骨来献祭
I need to consecrate the remains
of a powerful witch.

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,980
她叫莎莉丝特杜博
你们有一个共同的朋友
Her name is Celeste Dubois.
You and she have a friend in common.

9
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,248
以利亚
HAYLEY: Elijah.

10
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,482
仪式没有完成
The Harvest is incomplete.

11
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:28,286
如果没有完成，就都结束了
我们的法力都会逐渐消逝
If they don't finish it, it's over.
All our power will drain away.

12
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,655
我们的法力会消亡
Our magic fades.

13
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,697
接受祭品，以示吾等之信仰
Accept this offering
as a sign of our faith.

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,392
每一个死去的女孩
会将她的力量释放到下一个女孩身上
DAVlNA: Every girl who died
released her power onto the next.

15
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:39,663
我是最后一个
所以我拥有了全部的力量
When I was the last one,
I suddenly had all of it.

16
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:41,136
还是个艺术家，真不错
MARCEL: An artist, huh? That's cool.

17
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,741
- 这些画，是什么？
- 她称之为邪恶
-These drawings, what are they?
-She called them evil.

18
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,741
我的天啊
HAYLEY: Oh, my God.

19
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,806
你好，莎莉丝特
Hello, Celeste.

20
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:56,316
意大利人称之为“巫婆”
ELlJAH: The Italians call them "Strega".

21
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,980
西非的约鲁巴人称之为“阿谢”
The Yoruba of West Africa
call them "aje",

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,854
意思是“巫母”
meaning "mother".

23
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,290
我母亲故乡的人称之为“黑克萨”
Where my mother as from,
they called them "hexa".

24
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:08,423
而我们则称其为“女巫”
And here we call them witch.

25
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,570
几世纪以来，吸血鬼与女巫对战
也与女巫并肩作战
Over the centuries, vampires fought them
and fought beside them,

26
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,707
与其共寝，也将其烧杀
bedded them and burned them.

27
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,102
无论是敌是友
Whether adversary or ally,

28
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:19,245
女巫都是不可小观的力量
they have been a force
to be reckoned with.

29
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,744
她们祖传的魔法维护着这城市的稳定
Their ancestral magic anchors this city.

30
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:25,373
世上从没有如此强大的女巫
直到戴维娜出现
There's never been
one all-powerful witch until Davina.

31
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,851
她现在就在走廊那一头
KLAUS: Who is now
tucked in safe and sound

32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,253
在我的保护下安然无恙
down the hall under my protection.

33
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,053
你的莎莉丝特真是漂亮
Your Celeste was quite beautiful,

34
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,991
也象征着邪恶
and a portent of evil,

35
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:39,563
据我们这里情绪不稳的画家所说
according to our volatile artist
in residence.

36
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:43,600
是，也许黛维娜弄错了
把强大的能量当成邪恶
Yes. Perhaps Davina's mistaken
what she calls evil for power.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,295
莎莉丝特在当时确实非常强大
Celeste was certainly very powerful
in her day.

38
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:48,031
但她已经死了两百多年了
But she's been dead for over 200 years.

39
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:51,439
我不明白为什么会有这些素描
I don't understand
why all these sketches now.

40
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,239
女巫做的任何事又是为什么呢？
Why does any witch do anything?

41
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,115
走开
(SCREECHlNG) Go away!

42
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:07,289
别这样，你一定饿了
你都没吃过东西，自从…
Come on. You got to be starving.
You haven't eaten since...

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,984
自从你的好朋友杀了我的好朋友是吗？
Since your best friend
killed my best friend?

44
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,562
黛维娜，对于提姆那孩子发生的事
我感到遗憾
Davina, I'm sorry
about what happened to this kid, Tim.

45
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,199
我才遗憾你竟然不痛恨
克劳斯的所作所为
I'm sorry you don't hate Klaus
for what he did

46
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,391
也不打算让他付出代价
or want to make him pay.

47
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:17,502
他总会为他的行为付出代价的
不管以什么方式
He'll pay for what he did,
one way or the other.

48
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,661
但现在，我只想跟你讲和
But right now,
I just want to make peace with you.

49
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,931
为什么？
Why?

50
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:24,270
这样我们就可以成为
快乐的自我毁灭的一家人吗？
So we can be one, big,
happy Frankenstein family?

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,410
进展得才顺利嘛
Well, that's going well.

52
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,379
如果你要赢得那女孩的信任
If you were trying
to win the girl's trust,

53
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,248
或许毒死她的真爱
不是个那么好的方法
perhaps poisoning her one true love
was not the most splendid idea.

54
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:39,323
你还能找出更多不凑巧被我杀死的人
可以用来给我打脸吗？
Are there any inopportune deaths
you'd like to wave in my face?

55
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,154
给我一个月时间
我给你列张名单
Give me a month.
I'll get you a list.

56
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:50,800
不管是老的少的，死的活的
女巫都这么惹人厌
Young, old, dead, or alive,
witches are a pain the ass.

57
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:03,506
黛维娜，黛维娜
Davina. Davina!

58
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,981
怎么这么吵？
What's with all the racket?

59
00:03:10,623 --> 00:03:11,851
我的天啊
Bloody hell.

60
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,353
以利亚？
Elijah?

61
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,863
有件事情你得知道
There's something you need to know.

62
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,682
这是怎么回事？
What the hell is going on?

63
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:43,744
是黛维娜
Davina.

64
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:49,327
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：洪水将至

65
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,831
主演：约瑟夫摩根

66
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,906
嘿，你在玩什么把戏？
Hey. What kind of game
do you think you're playing?

67
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,565
我只说离间这屋子里的人
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
I said disrupt the household,

68
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,577
不是摧毁整个城市
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
not destroy the whole city.

69
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,041
不是我干的
I didn't do it.

70
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:08,339
我不是故意的，我…
Not on purpose. I...

71
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,074
我不知道我怎么了
主演：克莱儿荷特
I don't know what's wrong with me.

72
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,443
这太疯狂了
KLAUS: This is madness.

73
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,953
一个16岁的少女
主演：菲比托金
How can a 16-year-old girl

74
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,548
怎么能使整个法语区剧烈见动？
主演：菲比托金
shake the entire French Quarter?

75
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,783
我见过她使教堂见动
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
I seen her rock the church,

76
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,123
但我从没见过这样的事
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
but not anything like this.

77
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,023
她在阁楼的时候你怎么控制住她的？
How did you control her
when she was in the attic?

78
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,424
我不必控制她
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
I didn't have to,

79
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,193
但那时我没杀了她男朋友
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
but I never killed her boyfriend.

80
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,233
是，关于这个我们不是讨论过了吗？
主演：莉雅派普斯
Yes, yes.
We've been over this part already.

81
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,165
问题是，以她现在的状态
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
The point is, in her present state

82
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,501
她就是个无用的工具
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
she's useless as a tool

83
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:33,197
无法对抗女巫
against the witches.

84
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,238
她不是什么工具，她身体出问题了
She's not a tool.
Something's wrong with her.

85
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,137
她体内能量超载，她控制不了
She has too much power
that she cannot control.

86
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,436
我们都知道那能量有多强大
That much we already knew.

87
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:42,604
但为什么这些能量
会如此激烈地爆发出来呢？
But why is it manifesting itself
in such an aggressive manner?

88
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,477
你去哪？
Where are you going?

89
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:48,314
这是女巫问题
就找个女巫问问
This is witch business.
Let's ask a witch.

90
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,321
你要去找苏菲
You're going to see Sophie.

91
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,158
你没必要偷听
我从来不瞒你任何事
You don't have to eavesdrop.
I keep nothing from you.

92
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,698
是，我也不想隐瞒你任何事
Well, I don't wanna
keep anything from you either.

93
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,665
如果你要出去见苏菲
And if you're going out
to see Sophie,

94
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:07,169
那么有件事我得告诉你
then there's something
that you should know.

95
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,276
她打电话给我，找我帮忙
制片：兰斯安德森
She called me
and asked me for a favor.

96
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,811
她跟我保证会帮我解除马赛尔
She promised me
that she would help break the curse

97
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,413
在我族人身上下的诅咒
而我要提供一些讯息给她作为交换
that Marcel put on my people
in exchange for some information.

98
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:17,640
我当时没多想
I didn't think anything of it.

99
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,682
但现在黛维娜画了那些
莎莉丝特的画…
But then Davina started doing
those pictures of Celeste--

100
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:23,515
不管是什么事
你必须告诉我
Whatever this is,
you have to tell me.

101
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,254
制片：邦妮怀斯

102
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,491
苏菲想找到莎莉丝特的遗骸
Sophie wanted to find
Celeste's remains.

103
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,727
所以我就…
So I

104
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,260
翻了你的日记
编剧：玛格丽特麦金泰尔
 went through your journals,

105
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,838
找到了你埋葬她的位置
编剧：贷安艾德穆强
and found out where you buried her,

106
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:42,497
然后把位置告诉了她
导演：莱斯利里布曼
and then I told her.

107
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,179
我知道这样做很蠢很八婆
I know it was stupid
and it was snoopy,

108
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,045
我应该事先问过你
and I should have just asked you.

109
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:59,516
说句话好吗？
求求你
Please say something. Please.

110
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,795
她想死后可以求得安宁
She wanted to be left in peace.

111
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,992
当女巫的遗骸被献祭时
When a witch's remains are consecrated,

112
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,865
其能量会增进其他女巫的法力
that power fuels
the rest of their community.

113
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,303
莎莉丝特不想别人找到她的遗骸
Celeste did not want her remains
to be found.

114
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,002
她要我答应她把她埋在
不会被人发现的地方
She made me promise to bury her
where she would not be found.

115
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:24,548
你不仅侵犯了我的隐私
还让我违背了自己的誓言
You not only violated my privacy,
you have broken my promise to her.

116
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,649
我以为就只是些骨骸，以利亚
I thought they were just bones, Elijah.

117
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,627
你如果真是这么想
If you truly believed that,

118
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,763
那为什么不亲自问我她在哪里？
why didn't you ask me
where to find her?

119
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,210
如果这是晚餐，那我免了
Ugh. If that's dinner, I pass.

120
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,478
苏菲，你去哪了？
Sophie, where have you been?

121
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,588
简而言之，盗墓去了
Short answer, grave robbing.

122
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,725
放下你手头的事情
我们要找黛维娜了
Stop whatever you're doing.
We need to find Davina.

123
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:10,260
我找到完成仪式的方法了
I figured out a way
to complete the Harvest.

124
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,091
什么？怎么做？
What? How?

125
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,631
我们需要
借助一位长老的力量，对吧？
We need an elder to do it, right?

126
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,632
我知道怎么成为一个长老
I figured out a way
how to become one.

127
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,431
苏菲，你不可能成为长老的
Soph,
you can't just become an elder.

128
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,470
法力必须由其他长老
That power has to be bestowed
upon you

129
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,303
传授给你，而她们都死了
by the other elders,
all of whom are dead.

130
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,466
懂了吗？
Following my logic?

131
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,113
借监一下前人的经验怎么样？
我查过了
How about follow your history?
I did research.

132
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,081
17 42年，女巫曾遭到大屠杀
所有的长老无一幸免
In 1742, there was a witch massacre
that wiped out all the elders.

133
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,878
所以她们决定女巫中谁能献祭
So they decided whoever consecrated

134
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,783
最强大的女巫遗骸，就能成为长老
the most powerful dead witch
in the community became an elder.

135
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,220
- 这一招很管用
- 有个小问题
-lt worked for them.
-Teeny flaw.

136
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:42,327
哪位强大的女巫能轮到你来埋？
What powerful witch
is even left for you to bury?

137
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,990
认识一下莎莉丝特玛丽赫兰杜博
Meet Celeste Marie-Helene Dubois.

138
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,599
以利亚米卡森的老情人
Elijah Mikaelson's old lover.

139
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,430
她在18 21年因身为女巫被淹死
She was drowned in 1821
for being a witch.

140
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,129
他埋葬了她，从未告诉任何人地点
He buried her,
never told anyone where.

141
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,934
那你是怎么找到她的？
So how the hell did you find her?

142
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,269
我买通了海莉去翻他的日记
I bribed Hayley to read his journals.

143
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,105
然后把她挖了出来
Then I dug her ass up,

144
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,806
这样我就可以献祭她的遗骸
吸取她的能量
so I could consecrate her bones
and absorb her power.

145
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,315
你还真一点都不失礼啊
That's not disrespectful.

146
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,819
不然呢？我们只有几周去完成仪式了
Yeah, well, we only have a couple
more weeks to complete the Harvest.

147
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,183
苏菲，我知道时间不多了…
Soph, I'm aware of our deadline.

148
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,417
如果我们失败了
女巫在这座城市就玩完了
If we fail, the witches are done for
in this town.

149
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,186
我们就永远没有法力了
Our power will fade for good.

150
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:19,092
那些牺牲的女孩永远不会复活
Those girls sacrificed
will never resurrect.

151
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:21,460
我的侄女也不会
My niece will never come back.

152
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,896
如果挖出些骇人的骨头能让莫妮克复活
If digging up some creepy old bones
means I get Monique back,

153
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:30,133
我才管不了那么多呢
I don't care about anything else.

154
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,334
我却得管
ELlJAH: I happen to care.

155
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,409
跟我来
You're coming with me.

156
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,987
你偷的正是
So you have stolen the remains
of the very person

157
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:47,648
黛维娜画了数月的人的遗骸
that Davina's been drawing
for months.

158
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,887
能解释一下这惊人的巧合吗？
Would you care to explain
this startling coincidence?

159
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:52,052
我解释不了
I can't.

160
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:55,667
我一直都不知道
莎莉丝特杜博是谁直到我…
I didn't even know
who Celeste Dubois was until l...

161
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,301
是黛维娜吗？
Was that Davina?

162
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,846
她最近养成的好习惯
Charming little habit she's developed.

163
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,484
- 那今天的地震呢？
- 也是黛维娜
-And the earthquake I felt today?
-REBEKAH: Also Davina.

164
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,677
而且她现在还喜欢吐泥土
And she's taken to vomiting dirt.

165
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,182
我们麻烦大了
We have a huge problem.

166
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,485
我以为时间还充格
I thought that we had more time,

167
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,993
但看来必须马上完成仪式
but we need to complete
the Harvest now.

168
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,893
正中你意你当然说得轻松了
Said the desperate witch,
conveniently.

169
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,055
我说真的
I'm serious.

170
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,724
刚刚的地震正是
That earthquake you just felt,

171
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,837
我们即将大难临头的征兆
a preview of the disaster movie
that is about to hit us.

172
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,302
我们凭什么相信你？
Why should we believe you?

173
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,703
你见过黛维娜，知道她的事情
You've met Davina,
you know her story.

174
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,810
数月来，她身上一直汇聚着
For months now,
she's been holding all the power

175
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,606
在仪式上牺牲的其他三个女孩的力量
of the three girls sacrificed
in the Harvest ritual.

176
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:45,080
那股力量本该从她体内流出
回归大地
A force that was meant to flow
through her and back into the earth.

177
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,743
一个人是不可能控制住
那么强大的力量的
One person was never meant
to hold that much power.

178
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,687
那会把她毁掉
也会毁掉我们
It's tearing her apart,
and it will take us down with it.

179
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,388
我们得着手准备了
KLAUS: We need to prepare.

180
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,762
照苏菲德弗罗所言
黛维娜的自毁之路
According to Sophie Deveraux,
as Davina self-destructs,

181
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,233
会经历四个阶段
she'll cycle through four stages

182
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,066
其代表了组成仪式的四大元素
that represent the four elements
that bound together the Harvest.

183
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,606
- 地震算吗？
- 是的
-The earthquake?
-Yes.

184
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,108
- 首先是土
- 接着是风
-Earth stage comes first.
-Then comes wind.

185
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,645
每个阶段都会比之前的更猛烈
And since each stage
is more intense than the last,

186
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:18,045
你将把这整个地方都掀了
Iet's just say
you'll blow the roof off this place.

187
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:20,617
风之后是水
Then after the wind is water.

188
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,720
雨水、洪水，有多糟？
Rain, flood.
How bad?

189
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,222
非常糟糕
但还不是最糟的
Quite bad actually,
but that's not the worst of it.

190
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:30,157
最后是火
因为是最后一个阶段
The last stage is fire,
and since it's the last...

191
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,559
它将是最严重的
It will be by far the worst.

192
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,394
但我可不想看到这个城市
在我手上烧成灰烬
But I didn't take over this town
to watch it burn to the ground.

193
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,297
你能阻止，对吧？
You can stop this, right?

194
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,667
是的，但你不会喜欢我的做法
Yes, but you're not gonna like how.

195
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,308
- 她们要完成仪式
- 不
-They want to complete the Harvest.
-No!

196
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,068
女巫说你会复活的
The witches say
you'll be resurrected.

197
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:48,509
她们说谎
她们为了得到想要的口不择言
They're liars! They'll say anything
to get what they want.

198
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,616
和马赛尔一样
和你一样
Just like Marcel.
Just like you.

199
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:55,345
黛维娜，你可能觉得我不在乎你
但你错了
Davina, you may think I don't care
about you, but you're wrong.

200
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,682
我知道因为别人犯的错
I know what it's like to have
your life stripped away from you

201
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,121
而被剥夺生命是什么感觉
because of other people's
bad decisions.

202
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,253
你觉得我怎么变成吸血鬼的？
How do you think I became a vampire?

203
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,658
你说服了我的弟弟妹妹
但还没说服我们
You've convinced my siblings.
You have yet to convince us.

204
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,299
我们没时间了
SOPHlE: We don't have time to waste.

205
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,264
第一个预示已经过去
The first sign's already come
and gone.

206
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,371
- 那就治好她
- 她已经治不好了
-So fix her.
-She can't be fixed.

207
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,941
那是什么？
What is that?

208
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,010
你情绪越激动
情况会越快恶化
The more upset you become,
the faster you deteriorate.

209
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,807
- 我用魅惑弄了些镇定剂来
- 不，不要
-I compelled up some sedative.
-No, no, no!

210
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,643
只要你保持冷静
就能继续活着，黛维娜
We keep you calm,
we keep you alive, Davina.

211
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,378
住手

212
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:26,711
她救不了了
SOPHlE: She can't be saved.

213
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,979
这事不会止于地震预示
This will not stop at the earth sign.

214
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,623
如果你们再等下去
And if you wait it out,

215
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,521
能活着讨论的只剩你们这些死不了的了
you immortals will be the only ones
left to argue about it.

216
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,696
不要，拜托
No, please!

217
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,026
不要，求求你
No, please!

218
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,084
你们现在信了吗？
Convinced now?

219
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,683
镇定剂的药量太多了
ELlJAH: We sedated her too heavily.

220
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:37,448
如果这是她镇定的样子
我还真讨厌见她其他的样子
KLAUS: Well, if this is her sedated,
I'd hate to see her otherwise.

221
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,591
我们都同意黛维娜必须牺牲
We all agreed
that Davina must be sacrificed.

222
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,252
没必要再让她搞得天翻地覆了
There's no need to let her blow the roof
off our heads in the meantime.

223
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,955
不行，我不许你动她
No way!
You're not touching her!

224
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,636
好吧，那一拳算我让你的
Okay, I'll let you have that one.

225
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,773
马赛尔，我也很不希望黛维娜受伤
Marcel, no one wishes to see Davina
come to harm less than l.

226
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,534
但这件事不是等待能解决的
But there is no scenario here
in which we simply wait this out.

227
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,904
她必须要死的
She's going to die.

228
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,740
说这话的女巫可把大家耍得团团转
According to Sophie, the witch
who screwed over everybody here.

229
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,438
收获祭确实起了作用，直到被中断
The Harvest was working
before it was stopped.

230
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,174
苏菲原本不信这一切
If a non-believer
like Sophie Deveraux

231
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,376
现在都能相信这些女孩会复活
can come to have faith
these girls will be resurrected,

232
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,612
那我也选择相信
then l, also, am a believer.

233
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,121
我从收获祭上救下了黛维娜
现在你却叫我把她拱手相让？
I saved Davina from the Harvest,
now you want me to hand her over?

234
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,227
你难道以为我愿意吗？
Do you think
that I'm happy about this?

235
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,228
如果女巫们完成收获祭
她们不仅会重新得到法力
If the witches complete the Harvest,
not only do they regain their power.

236
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,628
我们也会失去对付她们的武器
We lose our weapon against them.

237
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:26,102
地震，我姑且把它当作是可怕的巧合
The earthquake I was willing
to chalk up to hideous coincidence.

238
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,933
但这大风呢？
But these winds?

239
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:29,734
如果黛维娜不牺牲
If Davina is not sacrificed,

240
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,242
刚刚见动过的每一寸土地
现在刮起的每一粒砂石
then every inch of earth that shook,
everything blowing about now

241
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,745
都会被洪水淹没
被烈火吞噬
will soon be drenched in water
and consumed by fire.

242
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,852
- 现在你在乎这个城市了
- 我们应该在乎，是我们建造了它
-Now you care about the city.
-We ought to. We built it.

243
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,956
我们都曾两次目睹这里被大火夷为平地
And we all saw it
burnt to the ground twice.

244
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:52,254
我不会再让那样的事发生
我说得够清楚吗？
I will not let that happen again.
Do I make myself clear?

245
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,265
清楚了
Yeah.

246
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:57,902
清楚了
Yeah.

247
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,836
你不怎么喜欢人类，是吗
尼克劳斯？
-Not a people person, are you, Niklaus?

248
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,740
胡说，我最爱人类了
-Nonsense. I love people.

249
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,504
我这就去警告那几个比较杰出的人类
Just on my way
to warn a couple of prominent ones

250
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,113
以防状况一发不可收拾
in case the weather
gets out of hand.

251
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,249
如果你喜欢做外交言
If you fancy yourself
as plus diplomatique,

252
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:12,543
也可以跟我一起去
perhaps you'd like to come along.

253
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:16,552
不，苏菲德弗罗
很快就会献祭莎莉丝特的遗骸
No, soon Sophie Deveraux shall be
consecrating Celeste's remains.

254
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:20,283
尽管她的行为应受谴责
我还是应该去悼念一下
Her actions are reprehensible,
still I should pay my respects.

255
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,053
- 你有时间吗？
- 正打算出去
-Hey. Do you have a minute?
-ELlJAH: Just on my way out.

256
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,489
我们俩谁比较亲民来着？
Which one of us
is the people person again?

257
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,740
那没用的
Fat lot of good that will do.

258
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,244
- 我可没时间跟你寒暄
- 很好，我也一样
-SOPHlE; I don't have time to socialize.
-REBEKAH: Good. Neither do l.

259
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,682
等你在圣地埋入女巫遗骸后
When you're done burying
your witchy bits on sacred ground,

260
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,651
你准备好进行收获祭了吗？
are you prepared
to perform the Harvest?

261
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,518
你知道你要割开一个女孩的喉咙吧
You do realize
you have to slit a girl's throat.

262
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,249
而她是个很可爱的女孩
A very sweet girl as it turns out.

263
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,691
如果这样能够换回我的侄女莫妮克
我什么都做得出来
If it gets my niece Monique back,
I can handle anything.

264
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,657
你来这的真正目的是什么？
Why are you really here?

265
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,625
一切结束之后
When all this is done,

266
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:08,330
黛维娜将复活
女巫们的法力也将恢复
after Davina is resurrected
and the witches get their power back,

267
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,441
那时你将要做出一个决定
you'll have a decision to make.

268
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,042
洗耳恭听
Enlighten me.

269
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,942
一个拥有全部法力的女巫可以
与一个吸血鬼势均力敌
A witch at her full power can trade body
blows with a vampire punch for punch.

270
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,104
相信我，我知道
Believe me, I know.

271
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:20,013
我也知道
能跟吸血鬼公平对抗的感觉一定不错
So do l. Would be nice
to have a fair fight for a change.

272
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:22,016
公平可帮不了你什么，亲爱的
Fair only gets you so far, love.

273
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,121
有聪明的头脑才能走得更远
Clever gets you further.

274
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,018
这事结束后，马赛尔仍在这里
克劳斯也是
After this, Marcel will still be here,
and so will Klaus.

275
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,562
他们的手段有多卑鄙
你比任何人都清楚
And you know better than anyone
that those two don't fight fair.

276
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,857
如果要让他们不再掌权
你会需要一个真祖站在你这边
You are going to need an Original on your
side and I'm gonna need a witch on mine

277
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,399
我也需要一个女巫的支援
if we're gonna stop those two
from running things.

278
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:40,197
我没听错吧？
你为什么要跟我结盟？
Am I missing something?
Why would you side with me?

279
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:44,138
有时候，重要的并不是盟友是谁
Sometimes, what's more important
is not who you're siding with,

280
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,540
而是谁是你的敌人
but who you're siding against.

281
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,579
不要，不要
DAVlNA: No, No!

282
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,057
放开我！住手！
Let go of me! Stop it!

283
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,264
有我在
I got you.

284
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,905
我会保护你
I got you right here.

285
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,405
嘿，克劳斯说不要动她
Hey, Klaus said not to.

286
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,039
我受够了对他唯命是从
I'm done caring what Klaus says.

287
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:12,490
你没必要来这里
You don't have to be here for this.

288
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:15,360
苏菲准备献祭还需要一些时间
It's gonna take some time for Sophie
to prepare for her consecration.

289
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,331
我有时间
I have time.

290
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,031
这是我欠她的
I owe her this.

291
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,971
你想说说原因吗？
Care to elaborate why?

292
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,103
你有没有经历过一些事
非常…
Have you ever experienced
something so...

293
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:31,841
刻骨铭心，美妙无比
...profoundly wonderful,

294
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:36,147
而一旦失去却让你难以承受？
that when it was taken from you,
your life felt unbearable?

295
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:40,754
嗯，我知道那种感觉
Yes, I have felt that.

296
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,921
我知道那种痛是什么滋味
And I've got the scars to prove it.

297
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,463
我相信当你深爱着一个人
而那人也同样爱你
I believe that when you love someone
and that person loves you in return,

298
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,191
你会变得格外脆弱
you're uniquely vulnerable.

299
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,093
他们有一种特殊的力量
能将你伤得体无完肤
They have a power to hurt you
that's like nothing else.

300
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,069
蕾贝卡
Rebekah.

301
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,238
- 他把那女孩带走了
- 谁带走了她？
-He's taken the girl.
-ELlJAH: Who has?

302
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,350
那个该死的马赛尔
Bloody, bloody Marcel!

303
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,180
你还曾想过跟这种出卖朋友的人私奔呢
And you wanted to run off,
start a life with this back stabber.

304
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,721
就在事发前两秒
你不是还跟他鬼混在一起吗？
Says the man who was shacking up
with him not two seconds before all this.

305
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,694
好吧，如果想找到他们
我们必须分头行动
Okay, we need to divide and conquer
if we're gonna stand a chance.

306
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:20,854
他可能去任何地方
He could have gone anywhere.

307
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,298
我正和莎宾在一起
或许我们可以试试用定位咒
Well, I'm here with Sabine.
We could try a locator spell?

308
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,665
我去神父那看看
他们说不定会在教堂
I'll talk to the priest.
They might even be at the church.

309
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,602
毕竟这是我们最不可能去搜索的地方
It's the last place we'd think
to look for them, right?

310
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,572
好，你去搜索教堂
我去搜索其他地方
Okay, you check the church,
I'll check everywhere else.

311
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,352
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

312
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,621
我正准备把这些拿去…
I was gonna take these to the--

313
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,162
如果你要说“河口
If you say, "bayou,"

314
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,391
我现在就找个舒适的地牢把你扔进去
I will find a nice comfy dungeon
and throw you in it.

315
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,831
今晚不适合外出
This is not the night
to be out there.

316
00:18:58,003 --> 00:19:00,062
对所有人来说都是
...for anyone.

317
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,468
但有些人别无选择
But some people don't have a choice.

318
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,907
好吧
Right.

319
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,747
把这些拿着跟我走
Grab that lot and come with me.

320
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:19,457
吾将此遗骸献与大地
I consecrate these bones
to the earth.

321
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,922
先祖英灵，听吾召唤
Ancestors, hear me.

322
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,687
吾将此遗骸献与大地
I consecrate these bones
to the earth.

323
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,352
先祖英灵，听吾召唤
Ancestors, hear me.

324
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:43,106
- 这不管用
- 一点她的踪迹都没有吗？
-This isn't working.
-She's nowhere to be found.

325
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,613
不，应该是说她无处不在
No.
It's more like she's everywhere.

326
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,679
她的法力正在流失
She's hemorrhaging magic.

327
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,186
这意味着我们的时间不多了
我们一定要找到她
We have less time than we thought.
We have got to find her.

328
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:55,952
- 但我完全不知道她在哪里
- 请你集中精力
-I have no clue where she is.
-Please concentrate.

329
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,688
再试一次
Try again.

330
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,074
- 我不会伤害你的
- 我不相信你
-I'm not gonna hurt you.
-I don't believe you!

331
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,879
你和他们一样都想杀死我
You want to kill me
just like everyone else.

332
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,851
是我在你身上施了保护咒，小黛
I'm the one who put
a protection spell on you, D.

333
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,250
所以提姆死了，你却能活下来
That's why Tim's dead
and you're not.

334
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,948
你再扔我之前，先听我说
And before you throw me again,

335
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,355
如果我知道你的朋友会遭过不测
if I had known anything
was gonna happen to your friend,

336
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:30,825
我也会一样保护他的
I would have protected him, too.

337
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,825
- 是你救了我吗？
- 是的
-You're the one who saved me?
-Yeah.

338
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,196
但如今帮我施咒的女巫
和他们结成了同盟
But now the witch who did the spell
is in league with the rest of them,

339
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,895
所以我必须带你走
so I had to take you away.

340
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,270
- 这样你又能拿我当武器了吗？
- 我只是想保护你的安全
-So you could use me as a weapon?
-I'm trying to keep you safe.

341
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,003
黛维娜，看着我
Davina, look at me.

342
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,211
是我搞砸了
I messed up.

343
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,011
你的这些能力确实带给我许多优势
All this power that you have,
it gave me an advantage.

344
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,586
它让我得以惩罚那些女巫
也让我统治这个城市
It helped me punish the witches,
and it let me run the city,

345
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,883
而我把它看得太重了
and I let that mean too much.

346
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:03,960
但这一切都过去了
我们都是幸存者
All right, but that's over with now.
One survivor to another.

347
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,689
我发誓，现在我只想让你活着
All I want to do is keep you alive,
I swear.

348
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,962
我好害怕
我不知道自己是怎么了
I'm scared.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

349
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,131
你不是一个人
我们会解决这一切的
You're not alone.
We'll fix this.

350
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:22,078
- 你不会让他们伤害我？
- 不会的，没人能伤害你
-You won't let them hurt me?
-No. Nobody's gonna touch you.

351
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,403
你之前拿来的
我们都还没用完呢，克劳斯
We still haven't gone through all
that you've already provided, Klaus.

352
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,836
这些不是我带来的
Well, this newest bit isn't from me.

353
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,679
- 你真善良
- 我叫海莉
-That's very kind of you.
-Hayley.

354
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,408
这些人是？
And these people are?

355
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,518
我请基兰神父给他们提供庇护
I asked Father Kieran
to give them shelter.

356
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:05,248
他总是抑制不住自己想做善事的欲望
He suffers from an incessant desire
to do good.

357
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:09,690
但现在我要你帮个忙
马赛尔和黛维娜失踪了
But now I need you to be useful.
Marcel and Davina have disappeared.

358
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:12,591
从你目瞪口呆的表情看来
I assume,
from the stupefied look on your face,

359
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,527
他们应该没躲在你的阁楼里
they haven't sought refuge
in your attic.

360
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,363
- 没有，那都是过去的事了
- 那就充分利用你的资源
-No, those days are gone.
-Then energize your resources.

361
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,199
我不需要提醒你
找到他们有多重要吧
I don't need to remind you
how important it is they be found.

362
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,670
我明白
Yeah.

363
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,646
这些人，他们都是狼人
These people, they're werewolves.

364
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:32,977
神父说是你捐献了这些食物
And the priest,
he said that you donated the food.

365
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,915
你在帮助他们吗？
You're helping them?

366
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:41,219
他们不是你的族人，而是我的
都是很久以前的事了
They're not your werewolves.
They're my clan from very far back.

367
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:42,883
如今他们陷入困境
They've fallen upon hard times.

368
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:46,724
他们的困境激发出了
我乐善好施的一面
And their plight has brought out
the philanthropist in me.

369
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,925
我能说什么呢？
想必是受以利亚的影响吧
What can I say?
Must be Elijah's influence.

370
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:54,798
什么叫做你的族人？
What do you mean your clan?

371
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,840
我和他们的血管里
流着同样的血液
The blood that runs in their veins
runs in mine.

372
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,474
还有我们的孩子也是
And in our child's.

373
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:08,817
这个家族真是越来越复杂了
This family gets more complicated
by the second.

374
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:15,524
听着，海莉
给你一句
Listen, Hayley.
Word of advice.

375
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,060
与以利亚相处的忠告
别跟我一样
When dealing with Elijah,
don't do as I do.

376
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,967
直接道歉就好
Just apologize.

377
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:28,163
尽管他在很多方面都有所成就
但他最擅长的，是宽恕
He's accomplished in many things,
but he is a master of forgiveness.

378
00:23:36,314 --> 00:23:38,214
接近了
Okay.

379
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,718
找到了，她在河边
She's somewhere near the river.

380
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,519
- 没办法更精确了
- 也算有进展了，是个开始
-I can't be more specific.
-It's something. It's a start.

381
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,056
没有用
It didn't work.

382
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,627
我试图献祭她
吸取她的法力
I tried to consecrate her
and absorb her magic,

383
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,857
- 但什么都没有
- 我不明白
-but there's nothing there.
-ELlJAH: I don't understand.

384
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,297
女巫的法力在献祭前
都会蕴藏在遗骨中
A witch's magic is infused
in her bones until consecrated.

385
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:01,269
那就是有人已经取走了那些法力
因为那里什么都没有
Well, someone's already taken it
because there's nothing there.

386
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,273
- 一定有别的办法
- 没有别的办法
-Has to be another way.
-There is no other way.

387
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,837
除非你还知道有其他
超强女巫的遗骨
Unless you know
of some super-powerful dead witch

388
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,913
没被献祭过
whose bones
were never consecrated...

389
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:11,571
都结束了
...it's over.

390
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:13,949
确实还有别人
There is someone else actually.

391
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,349
我母亲
My mother.

392
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:26,121
虽然过了一千年
但你终究还是疯了
It's taken 1,000 years,
but you've finally gone mad.

393
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,027
- 我们的母亲？
- 是，我们深爱的母亲
-Our own mother?
-Yes, our beloved mother.

394
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,136
被尼克劳斯充满爱意地
放在地下室的棺材里
who Niklaus has affectionately
placed in a coffin in his basement.

395
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,896
虽然没插匕首，但也死得很透彻
Not daggered but quite dead.

396
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:36,233
她确实曾经试图杀了我们
Well, she did try to kill us all.

397
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,933
那我们这次就利用一下她
再让她安息吧
Well, I say we put her to use,
put her to rest once and for all.

398
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,602
如果我们现在把我们的母亲
埋在她后代所拥有的土地中
Now, if we bury our mother on land
owned by one of her descendents,

399
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,305
她就成了纽奥良女巫
she becomes a New Orleans witch.

400
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:47,919
我们身为她的家人
就可以共享祖传的法力
And we as her family
share in that ancestral magic.

401
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,212
我们是吸血鬼，以利亚
We're vampires, Elijah.

402
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:52,788
我们不能施法
也没办法拥有土地
We can't practice magic
or own property for that matter.

403
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,416
- 没错，关于施法的问题…
- 这由我来负责
-With regard to practicing magic....
-That's where I come in.

404
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:59,758
在他们埋葬了母亲以后
他们可以把她所有法力传递给我
After they bury their mother,
they can channel her power to me.

405
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,695
只是由于需要传递艾丝塔的法力
Only hitch is,
as conduits of Esther's magic,

406
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,132
他们必须参与收获祭
they need to participate
in the Harvest.

407
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,703
至于拥有土地…
And as for owning property...

408
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,972
我们母亲的后代也没有都死光
...not all of our mother's
descendents are dead.

409
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:14,236
- 孩子
- 那个孩子
-The baby.
-The baby.

410
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:17,779
教区税务稽查办公室
离法语区不远
The parish tax assessor's office
is just steps outside of the quarter.

411
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,180
种植园现在在海莉名下
Hayley now holds the title
to the plantation.

412
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,653
如果我们把母亲埋在那里
然后献祭那片土地
If we bury our mother there
and we consecrate those grounds,

413
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,655
我们就可以完成收获祭仪式
we can finish the Harvest ritual.

414
00:25:29,227 --> 00:25:32,492
你真是太聪明了，以利亚
You're a bit of
a mad genius, Elijah.

415
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,360
- 算我一份
- 难道我是唯一有理智的人吗？
-Count me in.
-Am I the only one thinking?

416
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,463
我们的母亲是史上最强大的女巫
Our mother was
the most powerful witch in history.

417
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:44,735
如果我们埋葬了她，就等于把她的力量
拱手送给了我们的敌人
If we bury her, we hand that power
to our enemies to use against us.

418
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,470
考虑到现在这种情况
我们也没有别的选择了，蕾贝卡
Given our circumstances,
I hardly see that we have a choice.

419
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:51,539
我不知道我操心这个干嘛
反正你们还是会按照自己的意愿行事
I don't know why I bother.
You two will just do what you want anyway.

420
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,707
不，我们必须意见一致
No, our decision must be unanimous.

421
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,479
- 这不是搞什么民主
- 你说得很对
-This is not a democracy.
-You're quite right.

422
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,418
这是家务事
This is family.

423
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:04,054
水
Water.

424
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,025
下一个预示开始了，蕾贝卡
The next sign's begun.
Rebekah?

425
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:14,771
兵来将档，水来土掩吧
Kill a demon today,
face the devil tomorrow.

426
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,498
算我一份
Count me in.

427
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:20,668
没有母亲怎么能算家庭聚会呢？
Well, this is no family reunion
without our mother.

428
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,073
我去把她请过来
I'll fetch her.

429
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,119
你利用黛维娜复仇的宏伟计划
就到此为止了吗？
So much for your grand schemes
of using Davina for revenge.

430
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,778
生存第一
推翻我哥哥的计划再议
Survival first,
plot to overthrow my brother second.

431
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,517
马赛尔会把珍贵的东西藏在哪里？
Where would Marcel
hide something precious to him?

432
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,924
你觉得我会把它供出来
这样你就能把我丢在这里腐烂吗？
You think I'm gonna offer that up
so you can leave me here to rot?

433
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,529
水往低处流
Water runs downhill.

434
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,189
你觉得我没溺过水
不知道那有多痛苦吗？
You think I have to have drowned
to know how much that will suck.

435
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,631
火还会杀死吸血鬼呢，提艾里
And fire kills vampires, Thierry.

436
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,068
你觉得烧成灰就好受了吗？
You think burning to ash
will be pleasant?

437
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:49,797
听着，我没有放弃你
Look, I am not forsaking you.

438
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,307
我答应你一定会信守承诺
I promise to live up
to my end of the deal.

439
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,411
等一切都结束我一定会救你出来的
I'll get you out of here
when all of this is done.

440
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,874
告诉我马赛尔会去哪里
Just tell me where Marcel would go.

441
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,217
码头附近有个地方
There's a place by the docks.

442
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,622
如果我能再等几周
If I can just wait it out
a few more weeks.

443
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,161
- 帮帮我，求求你
- 我会的
-Help me, please.
-I will.

444
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,032
等这一切都结束
我会做我早该做的事
And when it's over,
I'll do what I should have done.

445
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,503
把你送出城
Get you out of town.

446
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:30,104
我做了个梦，提姆没死
I had a dream that Tim wasn't dead,

447
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,772
他演奏了一首为我写的歌
and he played a song
that he wrote for me.

448
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,214
还亲了我
And he kissed me.

449
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,990
我们都只是普通人
And we were just normal.

450
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:45,861
听起来是个美梦
That sounds like a beautiful dream.

451
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,154
你来这里干什么？
What are you doing here?

452
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,761
但那只是个梦
But it was just a dream.

453
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,870
出去
Get out!

454
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,809
这会要了她的命
你的顽固会害死她的
This is killing her.
Your stubbornness will kill her.

455
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,077
我答应过她会为她而战
我不会言而无信的
I promised her I'd fight for her.
I'm not breaking that promise.

456
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:09,880
没人叫你停止战斗
No one is asking you not to fight.

457
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,689
你是这个女孩唯一的家人
You're the only family
that this girl has.

458
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,019
你欠她的，去为她而战，让她活下去
You owe it to her
to fight for her to live.

459
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,585
你找到他们了吗？
Did you find them?

460
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,053
他会带她来吗？
Will he bring her?

461
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,695
他会的
He'll bring her.

462
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,367
你们都准备好了吗？
Are you ready to do this?

463
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,508
永远在一起
Always and forever.

464
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,812
完成了
It is done.

465
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,582
马赛尔，没事的
Marcel, it's okay.

466
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,127
不，我辜负了你
No. I failed you.

467
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,929
不管是否这么做，我都会死
I'll die whether I do this or not.

468
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:41,538
现在唯一的选择就是
是否要让所有人一起陪葬
I mean, now the only option is,
is whether I take everyone with me.

469
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:47,474
如果这么想的话
不做还真有点自私
If you look at it that way,
it's kind of selfish not to do it.

470
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,046
一定还有别的办法
不该是这样的结局
There has to be another way.
This is not how it ends.

471
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,342
如果就是呢？
And if it is?

472
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,716
如果这就是我的一生
If this is all I have...

473
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,787
那我已经拥有很多了
...I've had a lot.

474
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,895
我有莫妮克，我有提姆
I had Monique, and I had Tim.

475
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:10,492
还有你从认识我的那刻开始
就一直坚定地守护着我
And I had someone who fought for me
from the moment you met me.

476
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:12,697
黛维娜
Davina.

477
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:17,838
许多人即使活到一百岁
都得不到这一切
Most people don't get that
even if they live to be 100.

478
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,846
马赛尔，我准备好了
Marcel, I'm ready.

479
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,537
火
Fire.

480
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:21,471
- 你相信收获祭吗？
- 我相信
-Do you believe in the Harvest?
-I believe.

481
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,999
收获之后将迎来收割
After the Harvest comes the reaping.

482
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,972
她们献祭已完成并被接受
Their sacrifice is made and accepted.

483
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:36,705
我们召唤长老
复活被选中者
We call upon our elders
to resurrect your chosen ones.

484
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:55,330
我们召唤长老
复活被选中者
We call upon our elders
to resurrect your chosen ones.

485
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:03,905
复活被选中者
Resurrect your chosen ones.

486
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,745
拜托
Please.

487
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,716
我恳求你们
I beg.

488
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,023
不
SOPHlE: No.

489
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,098
这样也不能让她起死回生
你知道吗？
-That won't bring her back, you know.

490
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,139
这是你的错
-This is your fault.

491
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:11,537
我不应该让你接近她
I should have never let you
anywhere near her.

492
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,236
- 马赛尔
- 在你来之前，这个城市一切都很好
-Marcel.
-This city was fine before you came.

493
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:16,710
我们都很好
We were fine!

494
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:19,281
黛维娜很安全
她将自己控制得很好
Davina was safe!
She was in control!

495
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,715
如果你没惹她生气
如果你没杀了那个男孩
If you hadn't gotten her worked up,
if you hadn't killed that boy!

496
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:25,822
对她的死我深感哀悼
但不要失去理智
My condolences the girl is gone,
but don't lose perspective.

497
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,584
我们还有自己的社区
这座城市所有的吸血鬼
We still have our community.
The vampires of this town--

498
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,819
我根本不在乎这些吸血鬼
I don't care about the vampires!

499
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,464
她死了
She is dead!

500
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,259
你听到了吗？
Do you hear me?

501
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,164
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

502
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:49,102
你也许觉得我一点都不了解你的痛苦
You may think
I know nothing of your grief,

503
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,646
但你错了
but you are wrong.

504
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,486
在我逃离这座城市之后的日子里
我以为你死了
In the days after I fled this city,
I thought you were dead.

505
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,517
好多年我都不敢提起你的名字
It was years
before I could speak your name,

506
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,629
那种失去的感觉格外强烈
so keenly did I feel that loss.

507
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,328
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

508
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,361
真的很遗憾
I'm sorry.

509
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:26,279
- 你打算原谅我了吗？
- 没那么容易的，海莉
-Are you ready to forgive me yet?
-It's not that easy, Hayley.

510
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,044
以利亚，我不该偷看你的日记
Elijah, I was wrong
to go through your journals.

511
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,020
我不该告诉苏菲关于莎莉丝特的事
I was wrong
to tell Sophie about Celeste.

512
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,751
但在经历过今天这一切之后
But after everything
that happened today,

513
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:37,861
我不明白为什么我们不能放下这件事
I don't know why
we can't see past this.

514
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,226
在所有人中，你最该知道为什么
And you of all people
should know why.

515
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:44,391
当我在河口高烧不退时
你看到了我的内心
During my fever in the bayou,
you were inside my mind.

516
00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:47,732
- 你知道莎莉丝特在我心中的位置
- 难道不是曾经的位置吗？
-You know what Celeste means to me.
-Don't you mean meant to you?

517
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:48,894
不是
No.

518
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:52,372
你知道爱有多么难得吗？
Do you have any idea
how rare love is?

519
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,805
在一千年里，我只遇到过两次
In a thousand years,
I have found it but twice.

520
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,971
一旦我拥有，我就会好好珍惜
And when I have, I have honored it.

521
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:04,216
我知道承诺对你意义重大，以利亚
I know what a promise
means to you, Elijah.

522
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,652
但那是两百年前的承诺了
But you made it 200 years ago.

523
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,649
而我活在当下
I live the in the now.

524
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,489
如果我感受到了什么，我会马上行动
If I feel something, I act.

525
00:37:12,663 --> 00:37:15,097
如果我渴望什么，我会主动争取
If I want something, I take it.

526
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,495
我不会因为逝者而冷落生者
I won't choose the dead
over the living.

527
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,034
而你为什么要这样呢？
So why are you?

528
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,006
对不起，以利亚
I'm sorry, Elijah.

529
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,956
这一切从一开始就注定是个悲剧
KLAUS: This whole thing was doomed
from the start, you know?

530
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,217
是的，我们拯救了这个城市
Yes, we saved the city.

531
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,385
倒不是说女巫们失去法力不好
I'm not complaining about
the witches losing their power.

532
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,826
但这的确不是我预想的结局
But this did not go down
the way I thought it would.

533
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:30,634
不过你倒是让我大吃一惊
你今天还真是足智多谋
You surprised me, though.
You were quite resourceful today.

534
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,174
你是怎么在码头找到他们的？
How did you find them
down at the docks?

535
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,137
在法语区可不只你一个人有间谋，尼克
You're not the only one with clever
little spies in the Quarter, Nik.

536
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,644
有时我真觉得自己低估了你，妹妹
Sometimes I think I don't give you
your due, little sister.

537
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:56,098
我知道以利亚的计划很疯狂
但我真的以为会成功
I knew Elijah's plan was mad,
but I really thought it would work.

538
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:59,861
我也是
So did l.

539
00:39:00,037 --> 00:39:02,528
我真以为黛维娜会活下来
I was sure Davina would survive.

540
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,937
她那么有生命力
There was so much life in her.

541
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,838
那些法力呢？
What about the power?

542
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,650
四个人本该复活的，但一个都没有
Four were supposed to rise,
and none did.

543
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,951
那些法力去哪了？
Where did all that power go?

544
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,992
- 我们为什么在这里？
- 有人召唤我们
-Why are we here?
-Someone called us forth.

545
00:41:07,164 --> 00:41:09,428
是谁？
Who?

546
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,726
是我
SABlNE: I did.

547
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:17,563
莎宾，这是为什么？
Sabine! What's the meaning of this?

548
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:20,505
贝丝蒂娜，这一年来
Bastiana, I've had to endure
people calling me "Sabine"

549
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,272
我都得忍受人们叫我“莎宾”
for almost a year now.

550
