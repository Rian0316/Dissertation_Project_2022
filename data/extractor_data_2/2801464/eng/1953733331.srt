Oops, knocked over a cdle.

349
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:44,584
Fire on shoe.

350
00:16:44,585 --> 00:16:48,354
If I don't get this out, it's
gonna be my memorial service.

351
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,022
Look, look.

352

Look, hippies, look!

Roland glass died hrible death

361
00:17:16,306 --> 00:17:18,073
in front
of our adorable cupcake window.

362
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,708
See? "Horrible, adorable"?

363
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,578
That rhyme just me
right off the top of my head.

364
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,746
Hey! Hi.

368
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:30,365
Isn't that right?

Caroline-

385
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:11,795
Max, I'm <i>thinking.</i>

386
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,136
Well, no one's knock, knock,
ocking on our door now.

than when ere was
a dead guy out the.

389
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,142
I'm having second thoughts
about how behav today.

390
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:27,844
I mean, how could we
have let hanive?

391
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,180
Hello.

392
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:34,084
I brought you some rock star
pudding to sayhankou.

393
00:18:34,085 --> 00:18:36,820
Oh, rock star pudding.
What's in it, pills?

394
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:40,424
Oken dreams?
Tear-stained panties?

395
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,459
Caroline?

396
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,328
I'm Noas easy as Max.

397
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:47,431
Said every gir
my seventh grade class.

398
00:18:47,432 --> 00:18:49,766
Look, I was wrong.

399
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,034
No, han, I was.

400
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:52,669
We should pay rent.

401
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,538
I wasn't talking
about the rent.

402
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,241
Rent? [Muffled]
O said anything about rent?

403
00:18:58,242 --> 00:18:59,609
I was wrong when I said

404
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,511
it wast personal,
it was business.

405
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:03,380
After Max stopped me
from being torn

406
00:19:03,381 --> 00:19:05,916
limb from limb
by the smelly hippies,

407
00:19:05,917 --> 00:19:09,586
I realized, with us,
it is mostly personal.

408
00:19:09,587 --> 00:19:11,254
And a little business.

409
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:12,689
A little business?

410
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,758
What other kind
could you have?

411
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,893
Max, let's not be hard on han.

412
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:18,795
He's giving us
this space rent-free.

413
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:21,732
No one said "rent-free."

414
00:19:21,733 --> 00:19:24,034
I came up with a number
I think is fair.

415
00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:27,304
$250,000. Yeah, sounds fair.

416
00:19:27,305 --> 00:19:30,774
I remembered that was
your original cupcake shop goal.

417
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:34,578
So when you hit that amount,
we can talk rent.

418
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:37,581
Han, that is so sweet.

419
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:39,449
And I'm not gonna ruin it
by bringing up the fact

420
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,985
that she just said
"hard on han."

421
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:45,021
Really, han,
it's so, so generous.

422
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:47,257
But don't know
if we're comfortable with it

423
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:49,426
what if we offered y
a small piece of theusiness?

424
00:19:49,427 --> 00:19:53,330
I'll wait for thrent.
You two are good fends.

425
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:57,667
A woman finally
offers han a piece,

426
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,370
and he turns it down.

427
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:04,508
Max. Google alert.

428
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,510
Oprah's topless?

429
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:09,446
Max, let that go.
That's never gonna happen.

430
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:11,815
Not with that attitude.

431
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:14,684
No, the autopsy
says roland glass

432
00:20:14,685 --> 00:20:16,119
choked
on a Max's homemade cupcake.

433
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,854
This is a disaster.

434
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:21,758
Hey, where's your enthusiasm
now, miss rachael ray?

435
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,860
This place is the balls!

436
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,695
And it's just a matter of time

437
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:27,464
till those sicko hipsters
are lining up

438
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:29,966
for "one of those cupcakes
that killed that dude""

439
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:34,204
open the window!
We're back, baby!

440
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:36,540
But we can't count
on a guy dying every week.

441
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,308
I mean, I have
a positive attitude,

442
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:39,476
but that's too <i>pollyanna.</i>

443
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,111
We don't have to.

444
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:42,546
That's what's so great
about this window.

445
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,214
Who knows what'll happen?

446
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:46,016
Right, and we won't
have to chase business down

447
00:20:46,017 --> 00:20:47,951
because we'll be
right here on the street

448
00:20:47,952 --> 00:20:49,653
waiting for it to come to us.

449
00:20:49,654 --> 00:20:53,557
Max, I feel so good
about the possibilities.

450
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:55,692
One night it could be
a black American express card,

451
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:57,961
and the...

452
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,300
Max, is it...

453
00:21:05,803 --> 00:21:09,005
Other nights,
it's a friendly little visit

454
00:21:09,006 --> 00:21:10,006
