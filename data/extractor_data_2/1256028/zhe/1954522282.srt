13

Penny定了个"11点前别敲我家门

If this takes off,I won't
have to be a waitress anymore.
如果这事有起色

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,500
I think you're just making that up.

Sheldon,I'm sorry about
your hamburger,okay?
Sheldon 汉堡的事抱歉了 好吗?

I just don't want to be a
waitress for the rest of my life.

00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,370
Maybe I'd be better off with Nancy.
或许Nancy能招待的更好一点

58
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,600
So,what do you think? I mean,this
could be a business,right?

And how much profit do you
make per... Penny Blossom?
你一个"Penny小花"能挣多少...钱?

Of course you're not. All right...

I don't have to pay taxes on this stuff.

I believe the Internal Revenue
Service would strongly disagree.
国内税收署肯定会强烈反对

68
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,330
But,if you took advantage of modn marketing
techniques,and you optimized your manufacturing process,

随便了 那我们怎么在我公寓
弄机器和传送带啊?

understandable but not excusable mistake.

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,510
I assume you're referring
to the sea shanty.
我猜你是说这劳动工作歌

135

Blossom in under three minutes.

would do a better job.
随便一种氰基丙烯酸盐粘合剂

It won't work,the flower's too porous.
不行的 花的孔太多了

Good question. ****tion channels?
问的好 你的市场销售渠道呢?

we should finish optimizing
the manufacturing process.

I have complete faith that
you will make them. Good night.
晚安 你们行的 我对你们绝对有信心

269
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,080
Leonard?
Leonard?

270
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:08,200
But,Sheldon,without your insight and leadership
this entire enterprise will surely fail.
但是 Shelon 没了你英明的领导
我们的事业绝对是做不起来的

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,200
You're right,of course.

Here,this will help.

to opiates or hallucinogenics,

you're going to have
to answer to my mother.

People say it's arbitrary.

If it varied slightly,life as
we know it would not exist. Bam!
如果它稍有改变
我们所知的世界将不复存在 嘣!

with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause.
现在 让我们考虑熵的改变
和因果联系 重新来看这论点

that's not expanding from the center--

no,it is retreating from
a,from a possibility space. Bam!
对的 而是从可能性空间衰减 嘣!

essentially Alice through the looking glass,
在那个空间 我们就像爱丽丝梦游仙境

being offered a cracker to quench our thirst.
穿过镜子站到红心皇后面前
被给予饼干来充饥

284
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,050
Of course,in another universe,let's
call it universe prime,
当然 在另外一个宇宙
让我们暂时称之为超宇宙

285
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,340
there's another Sheldon,let's
call him Sheldon prime...
那个宇宙也有个Sheldon
让我们称为超Sheldon

am really grateful for your help.

going to give you 20 cents.

291
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,060

292
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,200
Then never mind.
哦 那算了
