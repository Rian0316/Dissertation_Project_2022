1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,920
谁想吃最后一个饺子
Who wants the last dumpling?

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,610
我来吃
Ooh, me!

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,600
佩妮  等等
Penny, a moment.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,810
我们刚吃了泰国料理
We just had Thai food.

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,570
在泰国文化中  最后一口食物
In that culture, the last morsel is called

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,790
被称为"Greng宰"  它应该被赏赐给
the "Greng Jai" piece, and it is reserved for

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,400
一群人中最重要最有价值的那个人
the most important and valued member of the group.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,850
感谢大家给予我这么高的殊荣
Thank you all for this high honor.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,680
我见识到了令堂曾经的影子  您继续吃吧
I've seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,090
好了亲爱的  如果我们要看电影  现在就该走了
All right, honey, if we're gonna make the movie, we should go.

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,260
这话你可能不喜欢听
This may be hard for you to hear,

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,350
我说的"亲爱的"  指的是我的未婚妻
but when I say "honey," I mean my fiance.

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,890
我懂  起码现在指的是她了
Yeah, well, now it means her.

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,790
他想来也没关系的
It's okay if he wants to come.

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,160
好吧  但下次我们得找个保姆了
Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,340
好了  我也得上班了
All right, I got to go to work.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
-我跟你们一起走  -等下
- I'll walk down with you.  - Wait.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
你们谁的目的地离蒙罗维亚新开的玩具火车店近些
Which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia,

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,260
电影院还是芝士工厂
the movie theater or The Cheesecake Factory?

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,650
哪个都不近
Neither of them are close.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,640
这样一来  想必你们谁送我去
Oh, well, then I guess it doesn't matter

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,560
都没有太大关系了
which one of you drives me.

23
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,350
我们玩个有趣的猜谜游戏
Let's play a fun guessing game

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,750
来决定谁送我去吧
to see who gets to take me.

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,160
开始了  这个四字母单词既描述了
All right, this four-letter word describes either

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,760
一个打印机的字号  又描述了一种强迫受辱的行为
a printer's type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,910
事先声明  我才不送他去呢
Okay, I'm not driving him.

28
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,090
佩妮别放弃啊  这个你猜的出
Penny, don't give up, you can get this.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,320
你不跟谢尔顿一起去吗
Aren't you going with Sheldon?

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,190
不了  我对火车模型
No, I have no interest in model trains,

31
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,400
火车模型商店和令店主崩溃的老主顾都不感兴趣
stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,690
我还有点工作要做  所以...
Well, I have some work to do, so...

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,970
我不觉得那会妨碍到我
I can't imagine that would disturb me.

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,330
你继续
Carry on.

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,390
好吧
Okay.

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,550
你在自己家不会更自在些吗
Wouldn't you be more comfortable at home?

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,980
不觉得  不会
Not really, no.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,480
那好吧
All righty then.

39
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,660
我猜我现在要开始干活了
Guess I'll just get started.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,940
莱纳德  拜托  我不需要实况报道
Leonard, please. I don't need the running commentary.

41

生活大爆炸  第五季第三集

50
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,921
-艾米  -在
- Amy?   - Yo.

51
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:57,451
你还好吗
You okay?

52
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,041
当然
Oh, sure.

53
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:03,221
我以为你在读书呢
I thought you were reading.

54
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,361
之前在读
I was.

55
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,821
现在我在思索之前读的内容
Now I'm thinking about what I read.

56
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:20,411
你还好吗  莱纳德
You all right, Leonard?

57
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,381
你看起来坐立不安
You seem very uncomfortable.

58
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,111
我...  我很好
I-I'm fine.

59
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:27,661
我是不是该离开了
Should I go?

60
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:30,521
我有时会被告知自己作客时间过久
I've been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.

61
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:33,061
谁...  谁跟你这么说过呀
Wha... who told you that?

62
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:37,531
最近一次是我的妇科医生
Well, most recently my gynecologist.

63
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,131
你想待多久就待多久
Well, you stay as long as you'd like.

64
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,211
我很高兴听到你这么说
I'm glad to hear you say that,

65
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:49,571
因为我现在待的很开心
because I'm having a wonderful time.

66
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,311
我跟我妇科医生也这么说
I said the same thing to my gynecologist.

67
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,721
你打算去商店里买点什么呢  谢尔顿
What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?

68
00:04:01,721 --> 00:04:03,631
我什么都不打算买
Oh, I'm not buying anything.

69
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:05,831
它们那儿要办一个讲座
They're having a lecture.

70
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,801
"HO轨距的铁路发展
"H-O gauge railroading.

71
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:07,801
HO轨距:玩具火车的轨距  约为八分之五英寸

72
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:11,531
O轨距一半的尺寸  却能带来双倍的欢乐"
Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun."

73
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:14,331
非常有争议性的题目
Very controversial topic.

74
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:17,131
你支持哪一种轨距呢
Which side do you come down on?

75
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,731
今晚过后我会让你知道
I'll let you know after tonight.

76
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:21,901
不像某些人  起码我会带着开放的态度去听
Unlike some people, I'm going in with an open mind.

77
00:04:22,421 --> 00:04:23,421
不过这不是玩笑嘛
Who am I kidding?

78
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:26,261
显而易见  O轨距铁路  舍O其谁
Of course we all know it's O-gauge or no gauge.

79
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:31,681
你能相信一个成年男性还坐在那玩玩具火车吗
Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?

80
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,761
对于一位自己的母亲家中
That's pretty big talk for a man

81
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:36,141
还藏着满柜子的魔术把戏的男人而言  那算很成熟了
with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother's house.

82
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,401
首先  那不是把戏  那都是我的"幻想"
First of all, they're not tricks, they're illusions.

83
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:41,961
其次...
And...

84
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:44,761
其次  当我们结婚后  那些玩意都会被
secondly, when we get married, they're all going up

85
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:48,741
扔进阁楼里  这样你就能有衣柜放衣服了
in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.

86
00:04:48,741 --> 00:04:51,341
我为何要放衣服在你妈妈的房子里
Why would I keep clothes at your mother's house?

87
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,391
你也别这么想嘛
Well, don't think of it that way.

88
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,021
我们搬进去后  那就是我们的房子了
Once we move in, it'll be our house.

89
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,331
你妈会搬出来吗
Is she moving out?

90
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:56,981
她为何要搬啊
Why would she move out?

91
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,611
那是她的房子啊
It's her house.

92
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:01,681
你等等
Hang on.

93
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,171
你难道真以为我会同意和你妈妈住一起吗
You seriously think I'm going to live with your mother?

94
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,941
霍华德  我想这个问题我可以回答
Howard, I think I can help here.

95
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:09,221
是的  伯纳黛特  他就是这么想的
Yes, Bernadette, that's exactly what he thinks.

96
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,431
为何不住一起呢
Why not?

97
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:12,291
那是个好房子  很多屋子
It's a great house, plenty of room,

98
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,261
如果我们有了孩子  我妈妈还能帮忙
and if we have kids, Mom's there to help.

99
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:16,411
当然  当她讲"三只小猪"的故事时
You know, when she tells "The Three Little Pigs" story,

100
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:19,751
她的下巴上是真的有胡子的
she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.

101
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,771
我才不和你妈住一起呢
I'm not gonna live with your mother.

102
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:25,671
现在不会  以后也不会
Not now, not ever.

103
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:29,331
显然是有人和妈咪相处得不好
Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.

104
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,711
拉杰  送我回家
Raj, take me home.

105
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,991
别听她的  去电影院
Don't listen to her. Go to the movie theater.

106
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:36,471
赶紧送我回家
Take me home now.

107
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:38,241
去电影院
Movie theater!

108
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:40,811
好了  大家都冷静点
Okay, everybody calm down.

109
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,471
解决方法很简单
There is a simple solution here.

110
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:44,531
拉杰  带我去火车玩具店
Raj, take me to the train store,

111
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,321
然后你们爱干吗干吗去吧
and then I don't care what you people do.

112
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,541
冲凉可舒爽
How was your shower?

113
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,301
不错  不错
It was good, good.

114
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,991
好奇问一句  你平时都几点睡觉呀
Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?

115
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,071
也可作: 我整晚都精神

116
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,071
我整晚都不睡的
Oh, I'm up all night.

117
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,051
就跟小弟弟似的

118
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,051
我是个夜猫子
I'm like a possum.

119
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,131
你高中的时候不讨人喜欢  对吧
Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?

120
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,351
还好吧
Not really.

121
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:13,391
那是我的高中年鉴吗
Is that my yearbook?

122
00:06:13,391 --> 00:06:15,441
亲爱的莱纳德  你很擅长科学
"Dear Leonard, you're really good at science.

123
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,501
也许有天你能发明出
Maybe one day you'll come up

124
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,601
治疗呆子的良药
with a cure for being a dork".

125
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,591
Lightning Bolt是一摇滚组合

126
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:21,591
这至少不是
Well, it wasn't spray-painting a Lightning Bolt

127
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:24,091
牛头不对马嘴的
on my briefcase, I can tell you that.

128
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:26,191
作为安慰  我可以告诉你
If it makes you feel any better,

129
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,741
唯一一个在我高中年鉴上留言的人是我妈
the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.

130
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,731
亲爱的艾米
"Dear Amy,

131
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,751
自尊自爱和处女膜比交朋友和找乐子要珍贵百倍
self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun.

132
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,671
爱你的  妈妈
Love, Mom".

133
00:06:36,211 --> 00:06:38,581
你可以把杰瑞枢纽站
Well, you can add Jerry's Junction

134
00:06:38,581 --> 00:06:40,221
加到谢尔顿・库珀的
to the list of train stores

135
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,121
火车玩具店黑名单里了  我打死都不会再去了
Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.

136
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:46,281
今晚不顺吗  凯西・琼斯[美国偶像第九季季军]
Rough night, Casey Jones?

137
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:48,281
你是不知道呀
You don't know the half of it.

138
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:50,681
本来宣传的是说今晚将会是个
It was billed as a lively give-and-take

139
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:52,611
针对模型火车体积的优劣而进行的现场讨论会
on the merits of model train sizes.

140
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:54,991
可实际上只是为了唬那些
But it was actually a setup to intimidate

141
00:06:54,991 --> 00:06:58,691
没定力的乡巴佬去买HO轨距的入门级火车
weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.

142
00:06:58,691 --> 00:06:59,981
你包里装的什么
What's in the bag?

143
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:01,941
关你屁事
I don't want to talk about it.

144
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:06,011
反正我不是被忽悠的
But it's not a spine, I'll tell you that.

145
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,511
我今晚过得很开心  莱纳德
Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard.

146
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,841
我们以后要多这样聚聚
We should do this again sometime.

147
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,791
那是  常聚好
Ah, sure. That'd be nice.

148
00:07:12,211 --> 00:07:13,141
很开心听你这么说
Glad to hear it.

149
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,761
我这周五需要有人陪我去参加
I need someone to accompany me to the wedding

150
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:17,621
莫瑞奈丽博士和古斯图弗迅博士的婚礼
of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday.

151
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:18,851
他们有点像是灵长类部门里的
They're kind of the Brad and Angelina

152
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,961
布拉德和安吉丽娜一样
of the primatology department.

153
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,881
你带谢尔顿去不是更好吗
Wouldn't you rather bring Sheldon?

154
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:25,831
我也想  可我俩上次一起去参加的婚礼简直是场灾难
I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster.

155
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,221
他整场婚礼就像是个小孩一样
He behaved like a child the entire time.

156
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,191
不是我的错
Not my fault.

157
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:32,121
是你骗我说那里会有跟我年龄相当的科学家的
You said there'd be other scientists there my age.

158
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,451
无所谓了  反正你出局了  这次我带莱纳德去
Doesn't matter. You're out, he's in.

159
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,411
当初毕业舞会无人作伴  
No date to the prom,

160
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:40,681
如今参加婚礼却有两人任选 
two dates to a wedding.

161
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,821
真是造化弄人呀
Hmm, how times change.

162
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,911
嘿嘿  有人得去参加婚礼咯
Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.

163
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:55,671
我去开门
I'll get it!

164
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:56,721
你可以去开门吗
Could you get it?!

165
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,281
我不是刚说了我去开嘛
I just said I'm getting it!

166
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,541
好吧  我去开就是了
Fine, I'll get it!

167
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,411
我开
I got it!

168
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,051
我不想跟你吵架
I don't want to fight.

169
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:09,521
只不过你突然间说起要跟你妈一块住
I was just surprised when you sprung

170
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:12,151
把我给吓到了
the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.

171
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:16,101
对不起  我没事先问过你的意见
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I didn't run it by you first.

172
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:17,651
你在跟谁讲话呢
I don't know who you're talking to,

173
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:19,031
要不就进来说  要不就出去
but in or out!

174
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,191
别把门开着让虫子进来
We don't need bugs!

175
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:24,371
咱家会来虫子
The bugs only come here

176
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:27,291
是因为你是虫母
because you're their queen!

177
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,871
听着  这样怎么样
Listen, how about this.

178
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:33,481
在咱俩最终决定要住哪之前
Before we make any kind of decision

179
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,461
咱们先试婚一下
about where we live, we have a trial run.

180
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,371
在这住上一个周末  看看情况如何
Stay here for a weekend, see what it's like.

181
00:08:38,371 --> 00:08:40,041
你妈不会有意见吗
And your mom would be okay with that?

182
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:40,931
当然不会
Sure she would.

183
00:08:40,931 --> 00:08:43,821
妈  伯纳黛特在咱们家过周末  行吗
Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?!

184
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,551
她都自动送上门了
Hey, if she's willing to give the milk away for free,

185
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:48,701
我还有什么好说的
who am I to say no?!

186
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,161
看见没  她不介意
See? She's good with it.

187
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,261
说实话  你以前整天带那个印度小子回家住
Frankly, after all your sleepovers

188
00:08:56,261 --> 00:09:00,851
现在终于换成个女孩了  我放心多了
with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!

189
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:13,411
这么多年来  我都一直在犯一个严重的错误
All these years, I've been so wrong.

190
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:17,761
原来火车越小越好玩
The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.

191
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,311
你是个脑科学家
You're a brain scientist.

192
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,841
你可不可以给我解释一下  为什么
Can you explain to me why a brilliant man

193
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:26,831
这么聪明个人却喜欢玩玩具火车呢
likes playing with toy trains?

194
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,211
我必须把他的大脑切看研究一下才能回答你
Not without cutting his head open, no.

195
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:33,071
把我的眼睛化成埃及艳后怎么样
How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?

196
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:35,061
真的吗  就为了参加个婚礼
Really? For a wedding?

197
00:09:35,061 --> 00:09:36,261
也许你说得对
Perhaps you're right.

198
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,861
我的颧骨和我那诱人的骨盆
My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis

199
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,981
对他们来说就已经够具冲击力的了
already have a certain "hello sailor" quality to them.

200
00:09:42,261 --> 00:09:43,561
准备好了吗
Ready.

201
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:47,841
帅爆了
So handsome.

202
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,171
就跟007一样
Like James Bond.

203
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,811
他比007还给力  因为他更迷你
He's better than James Bond, because he's tinier.

204
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:57,461
给  把这个给我戴上
I got you this to give to me.

205
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:00,431
亲爱的  宾客参加婚礼
Oh, sweetie, guests don't normally

206
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:01,901
一般不戴胸花
wear corsages to a wedding.

207
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,581
去毕业舞会才戴
That's more of a prom thing.

208
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,951
我没去我的毕业舞会
I never went to my prom.

209
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,491
我妈付钱给我表哥让他带我去
My mom paid my cousin to take me,

210
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,871
但他用那钱买毒品去了
but he just used the money to buy drugs.

211
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,521
快帮她戴上胸花
Put the corsage on her.

212
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:17,201
艾米  这是为你准备的
Amy, this is for you.

213
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:21,721
你意思意思就好  回头我还是戴手腕上
When you're done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.

214
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:28,301
全员上车
All aboard!

215
00:10:29,021 --> 00:10:30,351
我正式宣布
It's official.

216
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:33,431
我现在是HO火车爱好者了
I'm an H-O trainiac.

217
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:38,861
晚餐进行得还不错
So, dinner went nice.

218
00:10:38,861 --> 00:10:41,091
我想是吧
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

219
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:44,751
你妈妈一直给你切肉的吗
Does your mother always cut your meat for you?

220
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,031
只是切肥肉而已
Only when it's fatty.

221
00:10:50,091 --> 00:10:51,711
别吃醋  宝贝儿
Well, don't be jealous, babe.

222
00:10:51,711 --> 00:10:54,451
以后你也能给我切
Someday you'll get to cut it for me.

223
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,101
伯纳黛特
Bernadette!

224
00:10:56,101 --> 00:11:00,371
我又找到一个洗牙器刷头  你要用吗
I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!

225
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,261
不用了  沃罗威茨夫人
I'm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.

226
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,201
你确定吗
You sure?!

227
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:06,841
我刚洗出来半块胸肉
I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!

228
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,801
老妈  留点私人空间好吗
Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?!

229
00:11:09,801 --> 00:11:12,121
唔  我懂的
Oh, I know what that means!

230
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,341
甚好甚好
Hubba-hubba!

231
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,911
老天
Oh, God.

232
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:17,811
别担心  会没事的
Relax, it'll be fine.

233
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:19,891
好吧
Okay.

234
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,601
你们亲热完了和我说一声
Let me know when you're done canoodling!

235
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,461
到时给你老妈子搓搓脚丫子
Mommy needs a foot rub!

236
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,751
你想去跳舞吗
Would you like to dance?

237
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:44,581
不用了
No, thank you.

238
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,561
我真不是个擅长跳舞的人
I'm really not much of a dancer.

239
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,631
那这么说来你在健谈方面
You're not exactly winning any trophies

240
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,741
也失败的很
as a conversationalist, either.

241
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,571
不好意思
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:56,891 --> 00:11:58,751
新娘新郎看起来很开心
The bride and groom seem happy.

243
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,221
他们当然开心了
Why shouldn't they be?

244
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,281
他们马上就可以进行
They have a feverish night of

245
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:04,491
社会公认的激情交配之夜了
socially-approved copulation ahead of them.

246
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:07,881
在某些文化习俗里  我们要站在洞房外
In some cultures, we'd stand outside of their bedroom

247
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:10,571
欢呼他们达到高潮
cheering as they achieved orgasm.

248
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:12,891
这听起来要搞到很晚
That sounds like a late night,

249
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,041
而我第二天一早要工作  所以...
and I have work in the morning, so...

250
00:12:16,371 --> 00:12:17,781
莱纳德  也许你没注意到
Leonard, you may not have noticed,

251
00:12:17,781 --> 00:12:20,141
但我在努力逗你开心
but I am being a delight here.

252
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,621
而你却觉得待不下去了
And you're not holding up your end of the evening.

253
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:26,141
不好意思  只是这场婚礼让我想起
Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me

254
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:29,831
我那所谓的远在天边的女朋友
of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.

255
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:32,591
我那个所谓的男朋友  现在正沉迷于玩具火车中
I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who's playing with a model train right now,

256
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,761
我还没跟你吐槽呢
 you don't hear me bitching about it.

257
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:41,001
莱纳德  友情提示一下  装忧郁
Leonard, a word of advice-- moody self-obsession

258
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,971
只适合那些玩吉他
is only attractive in men who can play guitar

259
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,721
跟身高比你有优势的男生
and are considerably taller than you.

260
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,111
我不忧郁
I'm not moody.

261
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,561
我很风趣
I'm fun.

262
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,941
那你有什么证据证明吗
You have any evidence to support that statement?

263
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:54,281
我就和你一样风趣
Well, hey, I'm just as much fun as you are.

264
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,141
是吗  你会在手指上画个小胡子
Really? Are you willing to draw a mustache on your finger

265
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:59,571
用来活跃气氛吗
as a conversational icebreaker?

266
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,101
我就会
I am.

267
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:07,561
好吧  你有什么建议
Okay, fine, what do you suggest?

268
00:13:09,211 --> 00:13:10,851
我们刚刚大吃了一顿
We just had a lovely meal,

269
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:14,051
而现在乐队正嗨得火热
the band... is on fire...

270
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:16,361
你旁边是位漂亮的女士
and you're sitting next to a beautiful woman

271
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,321
还浓妆艳抹地涂得像个妓女
wearing whorish makeup.

272
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,781
我们干嘛不去跳个舞
Why don't we head out on the dance floor

273
00:13:21,781 --> 00:13:24,431
看我能不能跳得一身湿
and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.

274
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:27,831
再强调一下  我真的不擅长跳舞
Once again, I-I'm really not much of a dancer.

275
00:13:27,831 --> 00:13:29,481
别担心
Don't worry...

276
00:13:29,481 --> 00:13:31,581
我来领舞
I'll lead.

277
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:40,061
著名的"小鸡舞"
("The Chicken Dance" playing)

278
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:04,511
霍华德
Howard?

279
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,191
准备好觉觉了吗
Ready for bed?

280
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:10,291
没有  我要刷牙  但你妈妈
No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother's

281
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,891
已经霸占了厕所快一个小时了
been in the bathroom for, like, an hour. Oh.

282
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,691
嗯  她有时候那方面的确有点困难  等下
Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on.

283
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,791
妈  放弃吧
Ma, give up!

284
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,931
今晚你没戏了
Tonight's not your night!

285
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:25,331
你怎么知道  我才刚坐下
You don't know that! I just sat down!

286
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,641
得了  歇会吧
Come on, take a break!

287
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:28,661
伯纳黛特要刷牙
Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!

288
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:30,351
她可以进来刷牙啊
She can come in and brush her teeth!

289
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,661
我又不介意
I'm not embarrassed!

290
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,551
问题解决了
Problem solved.

291
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,121
才没有  我才不要进去
No, it's not. I'm not going in there.

292
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,461
没事的  亲爱的
Oh, come on, honey.

293
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:43,891
她只是坐那看杂志罢了
She's just sitting in there reading a magazine.

294
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:44,851
你什么都看不到的
You can't see anything.

295
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,911
我向来都是直接进去的
I go in all the time.

296
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,451
哈哈  "鹰"总算降落了
Ha! The eagle has landed!

297
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,451
人类首次登陆月球时发出的报告：鹰已降落

298
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:57,681
而且是降落在"大海"中
And we have splashdown.

299
00:14:59,671 --> 00:15:01,761
稍等下啊  我去点蜡烛
Wait here, I'm gonna go light a candle.

300
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:06,111
然后我们来激情爱爱
And then we make passionate love.

301
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,401
快了  马上到了
There we go, last floor.

302
00:15:14,401 --> 00:15:15,801
我真不明白怎么回事
I just can't figure out what happened.

303
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,581
我把左腿放进去  再拿出来
I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out,

304
00:15:18,581 --> 00:15:22,751
再放进去  然后什么东西就噼啪乱响
I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.

305
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,891
变戏法不适合你这老胳膊老腿了
The hokey pokey is a young man's game.

306
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:28,301
今晚真的很开心
I did have a great time.

307
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:29,811
谢谢你提醒我
Thank you for reminding me

308
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:32,211
偶尔找找乐子也是可以的
it's okay to have fun once in a while.

309
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,431
不客气
You're welcome.

310
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:35,371
再谢谢你掰下冰天鹅的头
And also for breaking the head off the ice swan

311
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,311
让我敷着拉伤的腹股沟
so I could hold it against my pulled groin.

312
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,121
我擅长空间推理
I excel at spatial reasoning,

313
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:42,071
当时预感到天鹅脖子那优美的弧度
and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck

314
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,651
能恰好做你生殖器的支架
would cradle your genitals nicely.

315
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:49,261
明白  再次感谢
Well, okay. Again, thank you.

316
00:15:49,261 --> 00:15:51,741
再次不用谢
And again, you're welcome.

317
00:15:53,771 --> 00:15:55,321
想进来喝杯茶吗
Want to come in, have a cup of tea?

318
00:15:55,321 --> 00:15:56,891
不用了  谢谢  我该回家了
No, thanks. I'm gonna head home.

319
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:58,361
好吧  晚安
'Kay. Well, good night.

320
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,981
晚安
Good night.

321
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:10,111
小米  嗨  婚礼怎样
Ames, hi. How was the wedding?

322
00:16:10,111 --> 00:16:14,191
棒极了  直到我不小心让莱纳德爱上我
Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.

323
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:20,001
进来吧  我们得聊聊
Come in, let's talk.

324
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,811
想来杯酒吗
Do you want a glass of wine?

325
00:16:22,811 --> 00:16:24,741
酒就是我陷入此困境的罪魁之一
Wine is one of the reasons I'm in this fix.

326
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:27,021
还有个祸首就是这该死的骨盆
That and this dang pelvis.

327
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,401
好吧  抱歉  到底怎么回事
Okay, I'm sorry, what exactly happened?

328
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:32,421
这是不可避免的
The inevitable--

329
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,681
他思念女友  孤独又脆弱
he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend,

330
00:16:34,681 --> 00:16:36,551
而我迷人又支持他
while I was charming, supportive

331
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:38,131
还有  面对现实吧  穿着这身裙子
and, let's face it, in this dress,

332
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,171
我就是麦当娜和浪女的绝妙组合
the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.

333
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:44,581
天哪  他对你下手了吗
Oh, God, did he make a move on you?

334
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,941
没  但这只是时间问题
No, but it's only a matter of time.

335
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:49,041
我怎么会没早料到呢
How could I have not seen this coming?

336
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,051
现在我得伤了这小糊涂虫的心了
Now I'm gonna have to break the little sad sack's heart.

337
00:16:53,851 --> 00:16:55,551
没事  我相信他挺得过去
Yeah, I'm sure he'll be okay.

338
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,361
佩妮  我最多只是知道
Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that

339
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,241
我们俩被同一个男人玷污了
the two of us had been defiled by the same man,

340
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,671
莱纳德完全提不起我的性致
Leonard just doesn't get my motor running.

341
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,771
那你想怎么做呢
So, um, what are you gonna do?

342
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,821
你想让我去告诉莱纳德  让他好受点吗
Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?

343
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,051
不  就让他痴心妄想一晚吧
No. I'll let him have tonight.

344
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:14,511
然后明天早上
Then in the morning,

345
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,791
我会给他发电邮  让他知道
I'll send him an e-mail letting him know

346
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,621
这具身体无法成为他的极乐仙境
this body is never gonna be his wonderland.

347
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:23,311
老实说  你的机会还比他大呢
I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot than he does.

348
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,141
莱纳德
Leonard.

349
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,001
快看
Check it out.

350
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,321
我买了辆N轨距火车
I bought an N-gauge locomotive.

351
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:38,321
N轨距：比例1:160  轨距9mm

352
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,341
HO轨距的一半
Half the size of H-O.

353
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,341
HO轨距：比例1:87  轨距16.5mm

354
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:42,541
看  正好能放我嘴里
Look, it fits in my mouth.

355
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:46,401
看来你今晚过得很愉快
Sounds like you had a <i>great</i> night.

356
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:48,191
没错
I did.

357
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,821
-你呢  -也不错
- How was yours? - Not bad.

358
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,671
跟艾米在一起比我预想的更有乐趣
I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.

359
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,661
你这样说到底指什么
What exactly do you mean by that?

360
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,631
事实证明  她的确懂得
Well, it turns out she really knows

361
00:17:56,631 --> 00:17:59,501
怎样帮助男人放松和愉悦
how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time.

362
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:03,111
虽然老实说  我下阴被磨损了点
Although, truth be told, my groin's a little worse for wear.

363
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:10,341
你干嘛啊
Why did you do that?

364
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:13,941
我是要告诉你  她不属于你
To send a message: she is not for you.

365
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,291
什么
What?

366
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,461
她不属于你
Not for you!

367
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:29,934
早啊  帅哥
Good morning, handsome.

368
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,174
早  妈妈
Morning, Mom.

369
00:18:34,804 --> 00:18:36,704
是我
It's me.

370
00:18:38,724 --> 00:18:41,974
没错  是你  你早上真漂亮
Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.

371
00:18:43,464 --> 00:18:46,014
我和你妈妈做了早餐
Your mom and I made you breakfast.

372
00:18:46,464 --> 00:18:49,384
你们俩相处得不错吗
So you guys are getting along?

373
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,014
差不多吧
Yeah, I guess.

374
00:18:51,014 --> 00:18:52,424
霍华德  我们俩是不同类型的人
We're very different people, Howard,

375
00:18:52,424 --> 00:18:54,944
交流起来需要点技巧
so communication's a little tricky.

376
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:57,184
他喜欢薄烤饼吗
Does he like the pancakes?!

377
00:18:57,184 --> 00:19:00,124
他还没吃呢
He didn't try them yet!

378
00:19:02,564 --> 00:19:03,854
有黄油吗
Is there any butter?

379
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,824
这是黄油味糖浆
It's butter-flavored syrup.

380
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,424
你们在说什么
So, what's the word?!

381
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:09,844
他要黄油
He wants butter!

382
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:13,144
那是黄油味糖浆
It's butter-flavored syrup!

383
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,844
我刚跟他说了
I just told him that!

384
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,374
我不用黄油了
I don't need any butter.

385
00:19:23,374 --> 00:19:26,434
你要黄油  我就给你去拿黄油
If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

386
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:33,724
看来哥只能自己切了
Well, I guess I'll cut these by myself.
