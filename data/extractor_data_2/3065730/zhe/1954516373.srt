1
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:05,794
我和我的兄弟姊妹是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
KLAUS: My siblings and I are the first
vampires in all of history.

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,564
是真祖家族
The original family.

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:09,868
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
Three centuries ago,
we helped build a town,

4
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,476
这个城市
called New Orleans.

5
00:00:11,644 --> 00:00:14,272
现在女巫密谋将我引回此地
Now, a plot by witches
has lured me back,

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,472
希望我能打败一个暴君
hoping that I will defeat a tyrant.

7
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,712
一个我所创造的吸血鬼
A vampire I created.

8
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:21,786
我哥哥希望透过家庭的力量
My brother hopes
I will find redemption

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:24,719
让我得到救赎
透过一个奇迹般的孩子
through the power of family,
a miracle child.

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,950
半狼人半吸血鬼
Part werewolf, part vampire.

11
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,116
一个混合种
A hybrid.

12
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,693
我妹妹心怀疑虑
My sister is doubtful.

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,922
她觉得我无可救药了
She thinks I am beyond redemption.

14
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:35,898
尽管我哥哥做了最大的努力
我却有自己的打算
Despite my brother's best efforts,
I have a plan of my own.

15
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:39,095
我会夺回我的家园
让它重新属于我
I will take back my home
and reclaim what was mine.

16
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,739
我会成为王
I will be king.

17
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,403
纽奥良
MAN 2: The city of New Orleans.

18
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,343
全国各地形形色色的人们
People of all stripes and flavors,
from all over the country,

19
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,950
来到这里参加我们在街上的派对
come here to party on our streets.

20
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,586
有些只是来找找乐子
Some are just looking for fun.

21
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:59,487
有些则是为了寻求更加阴暗
更加危险的事情
Some are looking for something
a little darker... more dangerous.

22
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,360
所有我们邀请他们来到我家
我们可以满足他们
So, we invite them into my home
and we give it to them.

23
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,254
（屠宰场
派对永不结束〕

24
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,906
午夜来临，一切都会改变
Then, at the stroke of midnight,
everything changes.

25
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:21,202
是吸血的时候了
And it's time to feed.

26
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,456
这就是我让我的人开心的方法
This is how I keep my guys happy.

27
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,992
一个尽情享用的自助场合
The occasional
all-you-can-eat buffet.

28
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:37,527
我的夜行者很喜欢
My Nightwalkers love it.

29
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,723
他们得非常努力才能得到一枚日光戒指
Got 'em working hard, trying to
earn one of these daylight rings.

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,891
他们得释放一些精力
They deserve to blow off
a little steam.

31
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:46,561
我信任的那几个日行者
他们很喜欢派对
My Daywalkers, the trusted few?
They just like to party.

32
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,374
还真是声势浩大啊
It's quite an operation.

33
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,911
那你说说，那些被吸血的人怎么办？
Tell me, what about the victims?

34
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,276
似乎得挖很多坟墓才够
Seems like a lot of graves to dig.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,644
不能全杀光
Can't kill 'em all.

36
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,412
太多人失踪，旅游业会受损
Too many folks go missing,
tourism drops.

37
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,954
所以我们会用一点吸血鬼血来治愈他们
So, we heal 'em
with a little vamp blood...

38
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,922
抹掉记忆，再送他们上路
...erase their memory,
send 'em on their way.

39
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,061
没混乱，没烦恼
No muss, no fuss.

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,628
真有一套
I'm impressed.

41
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,924
都是从你那里学到的招数
Nothin' I didn't learn from you,
back in the day.

42
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,192
马赛尔
Marcel.

43
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,630
什么事，提艾里？
What's up, Thierry?

44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,670
我们有六个人
在法语区外的一间酒吧被杀了
Six of our guys were killed
in a bar outside of the Quarter.

45
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,931
夜行者
Nightwalkers.

46
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,233
没人看到是谁干的
No one saw who.

47
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,357
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：夺回家园

48
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,368
以利亚
Elijah?

49
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:57,408
如果不接电话
是你引我回这个该死城市的
If not answering your phone is part
of your clever plan to get me back to

50
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,807
聪明计划的一部分
那么干得好
this godforsaken city,
then, well done.

51
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,344
因为我很担心
约瑟夫摩根
I'm here and I'm worried.

52
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,875
在我踢开你该死的大门之前快接电话
Now, pick up,
before I kick in your bloody door.

53
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,016
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯

54
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:09,212
你是谁啊？
Who the hell are you?

55
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:11,587
你是女佣吧
主演：克莱儿荷特
Ah, you must be the maid.

56
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,319
我的包包在车上，帮我拿来
主演：克莱儿荷特
My bags are in the car.
Get them, will you?

57
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,518
嘿，我不是女佣
Hello.
Not the maid.

58
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,162
对
Right.

59
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,392
你是被我哥哥克劳斯搞大肚子的狼女
主演：菲比托金
 You're that werewolf girl
my brother, Klaus, knocked up.

60
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,431
我还想着会看到…
I was expecting to see 

61
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,367
…超自然的神奇大肚子呢
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
some kind
of supernatural, miracle baby-bump.

62
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,461
看来还没显现出来
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
Guess you're not showing, yet.

63
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,630
你是海莉，对吧？
It's Hayley, isn't it?

64
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,671
你跟你哥一样没礼貌
You have your brother's manners.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,206
还有他的臭脾气，所以小心点
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
And his temper, too.
So, watch it.

66
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,070
以利亚呢？
主演：莉雅派普斯
Where's Elijah?

67
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,100
问倒我了
主演：莉雅派普斯
Beats me.

68
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,979
他消失很久了
He's long gone.

69
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,615
“消失很久”是什么意思？
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
What do you mean, "long gone?"

70
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:38,207
前一秒还在这里
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
Well, one minute, he was here, 

71
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,310
信誓旦旦地承诺要保护我
making
epic promises about protecting me,

72
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,647
因为一瓶苏格兰威士忌
in this predicament
that a bottle of scotch

73
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,915
和糟糕的决定让我陷入窘境
and some bad decisions got me into.

74
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,922
他诗情画意地描述着我们是一家人
He was all poetic
about how we're family.

75
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,493
然后克劳斯就告诉我他跑了
And then, Klaus told me he bailed.

76
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,929
看来这就是我信任吸血鬼的下场
Guess that's what I get,
for trusting a vampire.

77
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,399
以利亚不是什么普通的吸血鬼
他从不违背诺言
Elijah is not just any vampire
and he doesn't break promises.

78
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,800
这就说明尼克劳斯做了典型的…
制片：兰斯安德森
Which means Niklaus has done

79
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,601
…他风格的卑鄙事
something dastardly and Klaus-like.

80
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,469
克劳斯，滚出来
告诉我你对我们哥哥做了什么
Klaus! Get out here and tell me
what you've done with our brother,

81
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,838
你这个自恋阴险的小人
you narcissistic,
backstabbing wanker!

82
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,480
喊够了吧
Enough with all the shouting.

83
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,548
妹妹，我该想到的
Little sister, I should have known.

84
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,709
我想那六个吸血鬼是你杀的吧
I assume the six dead
vampires were your doing.

85
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,944
他们太无礼了
They were very rude.

86
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,952
想要伤害一个可怜无辜的女孩
Trying to victimize a poor,
innocent girl,

87
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,887
她只不过是想要去法语区
just trying to find
her way to the Quarter.

88
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,855
抱歉，他们是你的朋友吗？
So sorry, were they friends of yours?

89
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,260
对了，你没朋友的
That's right,
you don't have any friends.

90
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,197
我有朋友，我有马赛尔
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
I do have friends.
I have Marcel.

91
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,099
你记得他吧？
You remember him, don't you?

92
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,762
你当然记得
Yes, of course you do.

93
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,737
他现在自封为法语区的国王
He fancies himself
the king of the Quarter,

94
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,842
关于杀死吸血鬼，他有一些规矩
and he has these
rules about killing vampires.

95
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,741
看看他对你会有怎样的处罚
会很有趣的
It'll be fun to see what sort of
punishment he comes up with for you.

96
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,972
我不在乎马赛尔，还有他的规矩
I don't care about Marcel
or his rules.

97
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,550
以利亚不会失信
你对他做了什么？
Elijah doesn't welsh on deals.
What did you do to him?

98
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,556
也许他在度假
编剧：黛安艾德穆强，戴克兰迪巴拉
Perhaps he's on holiday.

99
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,991
或者在楼上陷入长长的秋睡
Or taking a long,
autumn nap, upstairs.

100
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,628
去啊，四处看看
Well, go on.
Take a look around.

101
00:04:57,864 --> 00:05:00,128
导演：布烈德特纳尔

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,327
你和我一样都还熟悉这屋子
You remember this house as well as l.

103
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,170
我记得一切
I remember everything.

104
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,335
(1820年 纽奥良）

105
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,706
我记得那个总是醉醺醺的
傻瓜州长是如何
WOMAN: I remember how the drunken fool
of a governor hid away

106
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,348
掩盖我们吸血鬼的罪行换取金子的
all of our vampire sins,
in exchange for gold.

107
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,654
我记得州长举办的奢华派对
I remember the lavish parties
the governor threw,

108
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,189
似乎是为了讨好你
as if to impress you.

109
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,629
我记得有一刻
I remember finding
a moment of affection

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,631
我爱上了州长的儿子艾米尔
with the governor's son, Emil.

111
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,138
我记得甚至连以利亚都过得很快乐
And I remember that
even Elijah was happy.

112
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,572
你弟弟，他太过分了
Your brother, he's gone too far.

113
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,848
尼克劳斯，你真的没救了，是吧？
Niklaus, there is no
hope for you, is there?

114
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,146
- 我们打扰到你们了吗？
- 是的
-Are we interrupting?
-Yes.

115
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,310
没有
No.

116
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,890
亲爱的以利亚
你希望我得到幸福
Dearest Elijah, you've only
ever wished happiness for me.

117
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,390
我和艾米尔恋爱了
Emil and I are in love.

118
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,595
请允许我把他变成吸血鬼
Please, let me turn him.

119
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:08,329
蕾贝卡，州长仁慈地同意
Rebekah, the governor
has graciously agreed

120
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,403
掩盖我们许多…不适宜的行为
to hide a lot of our indiscretions.

121
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,836
但绝不会同意把他唯一的儿子
变成和我们一样
It would not do to turn
his only son into one of us.

122
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:16,872
为了我，求求你了
Please.
For me.

123
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,375
不可能的，妹妹
It's not gonna happen, sister.

124
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,105
如果我们把每个
和你睡的男人都变成吸血鬼
If we turned every man you
dropped your knickers for,

125
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,739
那么人类就会不复存在了
我们就没有血可喝了
then, human beings would cease to
exist and we'd have no bloody food.

126
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,647
你竟敢说这样的话，先生？
How dare you, sir?

127
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,789
- 你最好…
- 尼克劳斯，弟弟
-You would do well to--
-Niklaus. Brother.

128
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,554
尼克劳斯
Niklaus!

129
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,919
尼克劳斯
Niklaus!

130
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,358
- 等等
- 不要
-Wait!
-No!

131
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,662
他配不上你
Well, he wasn't good enough for you.

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,775
从来没有人能配得上我，尼克
你尽力确保了这一点
No one was ever good enough for me,
Nik, you made sure of that.

133
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,433
以利亚在哪？
Now, where is Elijah?

134
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,904
你去哪？
Where are you going?

135
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,608
看来夜晚还没完全结束
It appears the night
is not quite over, yet.

136
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,651
我要去和马赛尔再喝一杯
I'm off for another drink
with Marcel.

137
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,016
以利亚告诉了我你的逐步摧毁
Elijah told me your plan to take
apart Marcel's empire,

138
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,214
马赛尔帝国的计划
piece by piece.

139
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,485
我不记得计划里有你们俩
一起把纽奥良喝干
I don't remember it involving you two
drinking New Orleans dry, together.

140
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,993
我知道你没什么朋友，蕾贝卡
I know you don't have
many friends, Rebekah.

141
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,962
但是有些朋友在一起时会喝酒
But what some friends do, when they
get together, is they drink.

142
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:16,294
喝酒的时候，他们就会说出秘密
And when they drink,
they tell secrets.

143
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,267
马赛尔找到了办法控制
法语区的所有女巫
Marcel has, somehow, found a way
to control the entirety of witches

144
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,168
我打算搞清楚原因
in the Quarter and I aim
to uncover the how,

145
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,967
这样我就能加以利用
so I might take it for myself.

146
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,012
找到以利亚并不是我今天要做的事
Finding Elijah didn't
make my to-do list, today.

147
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,648
对了，欢迎回家，妹妹
Oh, and welcome home, little sister.

148
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,054
你，狼女
You. Wolf-girl.

149
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,457
我要一寸一寸搜遍整间房子
I'm gonna search this house,
inch-by-inch,

150
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,222
直到找到我的坏哥哥
到底对好哥哥做了什么
until I find what my evil brother
has done to my good one.

151
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,994
你来帮忙
You're helping.

152
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,638
州长有许多密室
The governor had
lots of secret rooms.

153
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,296
我带你看看他最爱的一间
I'll show you his favorite.

154
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,185
你觉得克劳斯杀了他
You think Klaus killed him.

155
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,884
我们是杀不死的，傻女孩
We can't be killed, silly girl.

156
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:13,787
但那也不能阻止克劳斯
想方法设法折磨我们
That doesn't stop Klaus from
finding ways to torture us.

157
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,520
他有一套神秘的银匕首
He has a set of mystical,
silver daggers.

158
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,994
一旦插入心脏就能让我们沉睡过去
One in the heart sends us
into a deep slumber.

159
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,292
克劳斯喜欢把我们装进棺材
Klaus gets his jollies
from keeping us in a box,

160
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,992
直到他决定把匕首拔出来
until he decides to
pull the dagger out.

161
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,161
他一定是这么对付以利亚的
That must be what
he's done to Elijah.

162
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,307
这个是我的
This one's mine.

163
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,035
他随时准备着你的棺材
He keeps your coffin on standby.

164
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,509
他喜欢做好准备
以防他的家人
He likes to be prepared
for when his family members,

165
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,477
让他失望
inevitably, disappoint him.

166
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,209
以利亚的棺材不在这里
他一定把他藏在别处了
Elijah's isn't here.
He must have stashed him elsewhere.

167
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,413
我感觉好恶心
I feel sick.

168
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,986
欢迎加入真祖家族，亲爱的
Welcome to the family, love.

169
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,680
你一发现以利亚不见就该逃走的
You should have run, the second
you realized Elijah was gone.

170
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,952
是啊，但女巫在我身上下咒了
Yeah, well, the witches have
put some sort of hex on me.

171
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,619
只要我怀着这个孩子
就不能离开纽奥良
As long as I'm carrying this baby,
I can't leave New Orleans.

172
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,059
一旦这么做，她们会杀了我
If I do, they kill me.

173
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,029
我了解克劳斯，一旦你生下肚子里
Knowing Klaus,
he's planning a box for you,

174
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,692
那个不知什么的东西
他就会替你准备棺材了
the second you give birth to
whatever's cooking in your tum.

175
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,302
我一我到以利亚就走
I'm leaving,
as soon as I find Elijah.

176
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:04,466
数十年插着匕首躺在棺材里糟糕透了
Being daggered in a
box for decades sucks.

177
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,511
相信我
Trust me.

178
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,676
你最好想办法破除咒语逃走
You best find a way
to break that hex and run.

179
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,373
有人吗？
Hello?

180
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,301
不是吧，马赛尔
Seriously, Marcel?

181
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,842
想吓唬我吗？
Trying to scare me?

182
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,913
昨晚你的人被杀跟我毫无关系
I had nothing to do with
the attack on your guys last night!

183
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,624
苏菲德弗罗
Sophie Deveraux.

184
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:03,996
我哥哥以利亚跟我提过你
My brother, Elijah,
told me about you.

185
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,694
知道我是谁吗？
Know who I am?

186
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,839
嗯，知道
Yeah, I know.

187
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,941
那你知道我们该好好谈谈了
Then, you know I need to talk.

188
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,703
要我猜的话，根据克劳斯过去的作为
So, if I had to guess,
knowing Klaus' history,

189
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,142
以利亚现在胸口插着匕首
Elijah has a dagger in his chest.

190
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:17,680
那是个魔法物
你是女巫
It's a magical object.
You're a witch.

191
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,478
施个定位咒
找到匕首就能找到以利亚
Do a locator spell,
locate the dagger, locate Elijah.

192
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:24,047
我不能使用魔法
这是死罪
I can't use magic.
It's punishable by death.

193
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,453
- 马赛尔的规矩
- 马赛尔？
-Marcel's rules.
-Marcel?

194
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,218
你觉得如果你不能给我我想要的
What do you think
I'm going to do to you,

195
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,691
我会对你做什么呢？
if you don't give me what I want?

196
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:31,090
做不了什么
Not much.

197
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,395
我被连结了
I've been linked.

198
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,966
你对我做什么
就是对海莉做什么
So, anything you do to me,
you do to Hayley.

199
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,432
谁？
Who?

200
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,833
对了，怀孕的那个
Oh, right, the mumsy.

201
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,236
算你走运，以利亚似乎很在乎她
Well, luckily for you,
Elijah seems to care about her.

202
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,239
否则我现在就扭断你的脖子
Otherwise, I'd break your neck,
right here.

203
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:49,741
马赛尔怎么会有这么大能耐？
How did Marcel get
so bloody powerful, anyway?

204
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,008
我一百年前离开时可不是这样的
He wasn't like this when I left
a hundred years ago.

205
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,183
马赛尔有办法知道
有人在法语区使用魔法
Marcel has a way to tell whenever
there's magic done in the Quarter.

206
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:56,343
他是怎么做到的并不重要
The how isn't relevant.

207
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,251
我告诉你什么不重要
I'll tell you
what's not bloody relevant.

208
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,358
一群不能使用魔法的女巫
A coven of witches
who can't do magic.

209
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,426
我的主意是，搬走吧
Here's an idea, move away.

210
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,688
我们习得的是祖传魔法
We practice ancestral magic.

211
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:08,265
这片墓地都是我们祖先的遗体
This cemetery is filled with
the remains of our witch ancestors.

212
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:11,301
不能接近他们，我们就没有能力
Without access to them,
we're powerless.

213
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,439
如果我们逃走
我们就抛弃了遗赠
If we run,
we're leaving our legacy behind.

214
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:16,040
我们的家、我们的家人
Our home, our family.

215
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,272
家人可没那么重要
Well, family's overrated.

216
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:30,788
看看我
我回到一个只带给我心痛的城市
Look at me, I'm back in a city
that's given me nothing but heartache,

217
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:33,754
寻找下决心保护一个孩子的哥哥
Iooking for a brother
who's hell-bent on protecting a baby

218
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:34,915
我根本不在乎那孩子
I don't care about.

219
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,527
很难相信
I find that hard to believe.

220
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,894
- 你还是来了
- 我是为以利亚而来
-You're here, aren't you?
-I'm here for Elijah.

221
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,398
一找到他，我立刻走
The instant I find him, I'm gone.

222
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:45,036
他傻乎乎地相信
He was the one who
idiotically believed this baby

223
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,365
这个孩子会是尼克劳斯的救赎
would be Niklaus' redemption.

224
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,475
而现在他失踪了，大概是克劳斯所为
And now, he's missing,
probably at the hands of Klaus himself.

225
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,542
而你傻得可以，居然相信
以利亚可以说服克劳斯
You were foolish enough to believe
that Elijah could convince Klaus

226
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,513
对付马赛尔
大家都知道他俩的过去
to go against Marcel, when everyone
knows that they have a history.

227
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,050
- 我知道克劳斯和马赛尔是父子关系
- 你不懂
-Klaus sired Marcel, I'm aware.
-You don't understand.

228
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,417
马赛尔不是随便什么
克劳斯转变成吸血鬼的人
Marcel is not just some guy
that Klaus turned into a vampire.

229
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,289
克劳斯把他当儿子一样疼爱
Klaus loved him like a son.

230
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:11,058
他们相遇的那天我也在
REBEKAH:
I was there the day that they met.

231
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,131
我们去埋葬艾米尔，州长的独子
We were burying Emil,
the governor's only son.

232
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,160
我们是这么以为的
Or so we thought.

233
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,368
结果发现州长还有一个儿子
It turns out,
the governor had another son,

234
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,063
是和他的一个奴隶所生
from a mother that he owned.

235
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,692
你叫什么名字？
What is your name?

236
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,393
我没有名字
Don't got one.

237
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,971
妈妈想要等到我十岁才给我取名
她怕我会死于热病
Mama wouldn't name me, 'til l
turned ten. Case the fever took me.

238
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,135
结果她却得热病死了
Then it took her.

239
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,404
你是个幸存者
You're a survivor.

240
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,282
幸存者需要名字
And survivors need names.

241
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,983
马赛勒斯怎么样？
How 'bout Marcellus?

242
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,355
马赛勒斯？
Marcellus?

243
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,983
来自于玛尔斯，战争之神
It comes from Mars, the god of war.

244
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,825
意思是“小战士”
And it means, "little warrior".

245
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,641
看来我们的兄弟还是有救的
Perhaps there is hope
for our brother, after all.

246
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,943
克劳斯在那个男孩身上看到了自己
Klaus saw himself in the boy.

247
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,916
他想起了我们父亲以前是怎么打他的
He remembered how our
father used to beat him.

248
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,885
他也是个私生子，而父亲就当他
He, too, was the bastard child
of a man who saw him as nothing

249
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:46,547
是头畜生
but a beast.

250
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,592
这就是为什么你的计划不会成功
And that is why your plan will fail.

251
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:58,931
你所做的只是把两个
迷失已久的灵魂凑在一起
All you've done is bring back together
two long-lost souls.

252
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,198
没有了以利亚
谁知道他们会做出什么事来？
Without Elijah between them,
who knows what they'll do?

253
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,515
这可比昨晚的派对差远了
Well, this is a far cry
from last night's party.

254
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,025
原来是想追卢梭酒吧的酒保啊
In pursuit of the bartender
from Rousseau's, I see.

255
00:14:26,832 --> 00:14:28,197
正在努力
She's a work in progress.

256
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,198
你坐在这里为她消得人憔悴
And yet, here you are,
pining over her,

257
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,894
而没有拿她当午餐
when you should be
eating her for lunch.

258
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:35,131
她一定很特别
Well, she must be special.

259
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,843
先谈正事，验尸官打电话来了
Business, first.
The coroner called.

260
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,376
他有我的电话
万一出现进客的尸体就联系我
He's got my number,
in case any dead tourists show up.

261
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,140
让我精猜，手上盖着印记
Let me guess.
Dead tourists with a stamp on their hand

262
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,714
血管里有吸血鬼血的游客尸体
and vampire blood in their veins.

263
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,182
难免有意外嘛
有人喝醉失足摔下阳台
It happens. Someone takes
a drunken tumble off a balcony

264
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,545
或掉进密西西比河里
or into the Mississippi.

265
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,053
今天就有两具尸体需要处理
And today, I got two
of them to deal with.

266
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,292
打扰一下，亲爱的
你在念什么呢？
Excuse me, love.
What's that you're studying?

267
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,294
变态心理学
Abnormal psychology.

268
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,830
变态心理学
Abnormal psychology.

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,232
或许你可以帮我这位朋友诊断一下
Well, perhaps you can help me
diagnose my friend over here.

270
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,032
他最近有点情绪低落
He's been a little bit depressed.

271
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,334
老是在想一个女孩
Can't keep his mind off a girl.

272
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:13,478
他跟我说那女孩是配得上国王的王后
He tells me she's a queen,
fit for a king.

273
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:17,606
我认为他应该放手向前看
I think he should cut
his losses and move on.

274
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:19,614
你有什么专业意见？
What's your professional opinion?

275
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:24,988
做一个好人，或许机会
Be a nice guy,
and maybe the opportunity

276
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,522
就会找上门来
will present itself someday.

277
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,792
今晚怎么样？九点？
How about tonight?
Nine o'clock?

278
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,487
我就在这里等你
I'll meet you, right here?

279
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,527
我会考虑的
I'll take it under consideration.

280
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,995
强硬
Hm. Harsh.

281
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,734
看来我魅力不再了
I dare say, I've lost my touch.

282
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:44,876
或是你魅力不再了
Or you've lost yours.

283
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:49,939
等等
Oh, hey, hey.

284
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,241
打烊了，抱歉
We're closed, sorry.

285
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:54,250
我只需要一点点草药
拜托
I just need one teeny, tiny,
little herb. Please?

286
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:56,252
什么草药？
Which herb?

287
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,821
研磨好的附子花
Crushed aconite flower.

288
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,488
附子草？那可是毒药
Wolf's-bane?
That's a poison.

289
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,558
想要杀死哪个狼人吗？
Looking to kill a wolf?

290
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,391
只是一只小狼
Just a little one.

291
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,195
等我一下
Gimme a minute.

292
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,278
和曼陀罗混在一起，滴几滴在热茶里
Cut it with Jimson weed....
A few drops in some hot tea.

293
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,915
这样就行了
That should do it.

294
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,345
给你
Here.

295
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,984
狼人要在这城市生存很难
It's an ugly town for wolves.

296
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,048
你这么做是对的
You're doing the right thing.

297
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,224
嘿，想讨赏吗？
Hey, wanna gain points?

298
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,728
告诉马赛尔法语区有个狼人
Tell Marcel there's a werewolf
in the Quarter.

299
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,202
你带我来了个绝佳之地
KLAUS: You take me
to the nicest places.

300
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,846
欢迎来到死后的世界
Welcome to the land
of the newly-dead.

301
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,379
我就不浪费时间了
I won't waste your time.

302
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,243
我想你跟他们说明过情况了
I trust you filled them in.

303
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:00,647
说实话，这两个没什么潜力
To be honest, not much
in the way of potential here.

304
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,515
是吗？我刚失去六个夜行者
Yeah, well,
I just lost six Nightwalkers.

305
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,122
我得填补空缺
I got holes to fill.

306
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,622
我速战速决
你们感到渴望
I'll keep this quick.
That itch you feel?

307
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,727
是吸血的需求越加强烈
That's the need to feed
coming on strong.

308
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,294
渴望吸食人血
A hunger for human blood.

309
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,660
你就成为吸血鬼
你就会再死一次
Drink it, you're a vampire,
don't, you die. Again.

310
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,893
这次是永久的，死在这运尸袋里
This time, for good.
Right here, in a body-bag.

311
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,595
你想留下谁？
漂亮傻女孩还是同志好友？
Hey, what do you think?
Cute, dorky girl or gay best friend?

312
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:22,240
你来选吧
Dealer's choice.

313
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,137
我来选，好吧
Dealer's choice, okay.

314
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:27,642
捡到这枚硬币的人得永生
Whoever picks up this coin
gets to live forever.

315
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,578
另一个人就得死
The other one dies.

316
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,919
开始
Go.

317
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,187
该死，女孩，真该死
(LAUGHS)
Damn, girl! I said, damn!

318
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,451
你怎么能这样？
How could you?

319
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,527
好了，乔许，我别无选择
Get over it, Josh.
It's not like I had a choice.

320
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,391
你也会这么做的
但你是个软弱的小…
You would've done the same thing,
but you're such a little weak--

321
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,499
让她在坟墓里自生自灭吧
Let her die in cold storage.

322
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:57,139
背叛朋友就是这个下场
Got a thing about people
who betray their own friends.

323
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,438
走吧，我们去兜个风
Come on.
Let's go for a ride.

324
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:03,504
走吧
Go.

325
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,415
好，就这样
All right.
That's it.

326
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,126
让我看看你还有什么本事
Tell me what else you've got.

327
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,873
触剑攻击，换反防守
Attaque au fer!
Now, counter-parry.

328
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,845
击中，明显击中了
A hit!
Palpable hit.

329
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,715
有朝一日我要娶你
I'm gonna marry you, someday.

330
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:44,651
我才不会嫁个决斗时打不过我的人
I would never marry someone
who couldn't best me in a duel.

331
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,558
再来一局吗？
Another lesson?

332
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,661
蕾贝卡米卡森
Rebekah Mikaelson.

333
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,436
又来教我击剑了吗？
Come to teach me another lesson?

334
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,842
我上次见你时，皇家卫起火了
你们全逃出城
Last time I saw you, Royal Street
was burning and you all were fleeing

335
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,776
躲避父亲追赶
the city from your daddy.

336
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,943
我以为你死了
I thought you were dead.

337
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,113
你从未回来确认过
You never looked back to find out.

338
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,550
你来这里干什么？
Why are you here?

339
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,152
找以利亚
我觉得克劳斯对他做了什么
Elijah. I think Klaus
has done something to him.

340
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,089
好了，别说了
Stop, stop, right there.

341
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,354
从你们米卡森家族身上我学到一点
There's one thing I learned
about you Mikaelsons.

342
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,192
不要卷进家族斗争
It's don't get in the middle
of family feuding.

343
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,492
没有好下场
It doesn't end well.

344
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,228
我们之间什么也没发生
我以生命担保
There's nothing going on between us,
I swear it, on my life.

345
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,531
你的生命对我很重要
Your life means something to me.

346
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,039
跟我说实话
否则情况将大不相同
Give me the privilege of honesty,
or that will cease to be the case.

347
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,371
我喜欢她，我觉得她也喜欢我
I like her, and I think it's mutual.

348
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,740
但我什么都没做，我不会的
But I haven't done
anything about it and I wouldn't.

349
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,745
- 除非…
- 将来也不会
-Not if--
-And you won't.

350
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,249
我爱我妹妹，但她总是遇人不淑
I love my sister, but she lacks
fortune when it comes to men.

351
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,253
他们来来去去，只有我一直都在
They come and go for her.
But I am the constant.

352
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,485
她是我的家人
She's my family.

353
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,719
你说过我也是家人
Well, you said I was family.

354
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,330
我求过你把我变成吸血鬼
I have begged you to
turn me into a vampire.

355
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,298
我说过当你准备好我就会转变你
And I told you,
I will turn you when you're ready.

356
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,430
你再靠近蕾贝卡，就永远别想转变
You go near Rebekah again,
and you never will be.

357
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:46,302
即使你已功成名就，你还是怕他
Even after all you've achieved,
you're still scared of him.

358
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,275
我不怕任何人
No, I'm not scared of anyone.

359
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,908
要是我发现你知道以利亚的下落
If I find out
you know where Elijah is...

360
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,117
你就不用怕克劳斯了
我会亲手干掉你
...you needn't fear Klaus.
I'll kill you myself.

361
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,620
虽然念及旧情，但是我帮不了你
Nostalgia's a blast and all,
but I can't help you.

362
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,030
还是很高兴见到你
It's nice seeing you though.

363
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,224
但愿你能找到你要的
Good luck finding
what you're looking for.

364
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,309
我懂那个表情，是和女人有关
I know that face.
Woman trouble.

365
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,351
你这个混蛋，你知道是吧？
You're a dick, you know that?

366
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:31,546
为什么不告诉我你妹妹回来了？
Why didn't you tell me your
sister's back in town?

367
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,317
我觉得让你自己发现不是更有意思嘛
I thought it'd be more amusing
for you to find out for yourself.

368
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,892
还有什么瞒着我吗？
Anything else that I need to know?

369
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:39,394
就是她这一百年来变得越发神经
Only that she's grown considerably
more insane in the last century.

370
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,499
也许就是她杀了我的人
Or maybe that it was her
who killed my guys.

371
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,831
难说，除非那个飙车族酒吧
经常有土里土气的
Doubtful. Unless that biker bar
is frequented by small-town,

372
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,871
高中橄榄球四分卫光顾
不然她才没那个兴趣
high school quarterbacks,
I can't imagine she'd be interested.

373
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,908
喂？
Yeah.

374
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,343
刚收到消消，有人在毕恩维尔公园
发现一个狼人
MAN: Just got a tip. Someone saw
a werewolf in Vionville Park.

375
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,312
带几个夜行者把他逮住
Get a couple Nightwalkers
to run it down.

376
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,814
把他的脑袋给我带回来
Bring me back its head.

377
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,519
看来杀了那几个喽罗的凶手
也水落石出了
Well, I guess that solves the
mystery of the murdered riff-raff.

378
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,986
至少我妹妹是清白的
Least my sister's in the clear.

379
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,819
关于那事，我可没时间
搅和你们的米卡森家庭剧
About that, I don't have time
for Mikaelson family drama.

380
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,791
你是我的客人，管好你妹妹
You're my guest,
keep your sister in line.

381
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,796
我用一支吸管把密西西比河吸干
还比较有可能
I'd have greater chance of draining
the Mississippi with a straw!

382
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,901
来吧，海莉
Come on, Hayley.

383
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:28,272
就肚子痛一下
这愚蠢的一切就都结束了
One upset stomach and all this
stupid drama is ancient history.

384
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,998
到法语区来真是个愚蠢的行为
Dumb move comin' into the Quarter.

385
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,536
跟我走吧，狼人
You're comin' with me, wolf.

386
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:57,504
我在这里已经受够了你们吸血鬼
告诉我该做什么
I have had it up to here with
vampires telling me what to do!

387
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,405
啊！
Ah!

388
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:07,280
这样对待孕妇可不好
Now, that is no way
to treat a pregnant lady.

389
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,947
我真的很讨厌没礼貌的人
I do hate bad manners.

390
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:18,620
这就是我叫你不要离开屋子的原因
This is why I told you
never to leave the house.

391
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,163
法语区是禁止狼人出入的
Werewolves are banned in the Quarter.

392
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,201
我本来计划好了，但你晚上出去
小蹦达一圈就危及到整个形势
I had a plan and your little stroll
put it all in peril.

393
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,997
别管他
Leave him!

394
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:28,696
你已经管得够多了，不觉得吗？
You've done enough,
don't you think?

395
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,100
把这些尸体像路标一样丢在我门前
Leaving a trail of bodies
like a roadmap to my door.

396
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,178
要不是我无意间听到取狼人脑袋的事
If I hadn't overheard this lot
bragging about werewolf heads,

397
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,042
这里每一个人都完蛋了
everyone here would be screwed.

398
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,274
还有别跟我扯什么计划
And don't give me that
crap about having a plan.

399
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,578
你一直都有时间去执行你的计划
You've had all the time
in the world to execute a plan

400
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,380
但你什么都没做出来
and no one's seen
you do a damn thing.

401
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,119
以利亚做了个交易来保护你的孩子
Elijah made a deal
to protect your child

402
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:50,693
希望能把你从自私堕落的
自我中拯救出来
so that he could save you
from your selfish, rotten self.

403
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,888
而你显然根本不在乎这个孩子和以利亚
But you obviously don't give a damn
about the child or Elijah,

404
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,794
瞧你做了什么去珍惜这一切？
because what have
you done to honor it?

405
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:58,094
我做了一切
I have done everything.

406
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,536
要我一件件地跟你讲清楚吗？
Let me spell it out for you,
shall l?

407
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:04,174
从我到这的第一天，马赛尔就不信任我
From the day I arrived,
Marcel hasn't trusted me.

408
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,038
从第一天开始
他竞让他的吸血鬼服下有毒的马鞭草
From day one, he's had his
vampires ingest toxic vervain,

409
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,648
而你知道的，妹妹
那是用来防止他们受我精神控制
which, as you know, little sister,
protects them from my mind control.

410
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,713
我需要一个间谋
I needed a spy.

411
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,147
一个和我里应外合
且马赛尔永远不会怀疑的人
Someone on the inside, with me,
who Marcel would never suspect.

412
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,184
所以我赶在他之前先下手为强
So, I created a day zero
and got there first.

413
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:24,789
嘿
Hey!

414
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:28,831
拜你大开杀戒所赐
马赛尔失去了六个吸血鬼
Marcel had just lost six vampires,
thanks to your little murder spree

415
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,433
他急需招募新人
and he needed new recruits.

416
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,069
好
Okay.

417
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:36,833
所以我把其中一个变成我的人
在他一滴马鞭草都没进之前
KLAUS: So I made the new one mine
before he'd had even a drop of vervain.

418
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,740
现在我们来聊聊你可以为我做什么
Let's have a little chat
about what you can do for me.

419
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,684
但我们都知道真正获得一个男人的信任
是要获取他的心
But we all know the real way
to a man is through his heart.

420
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:50,879
于是…
So.

421
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:55,619
我兄弟马赛尔…
不错的小伙子，你不觉得吗？
My mate, Marcel.
Nice bloke, don't you think?

422
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,990
不
No.

423
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:04,500
他很迷人、性成、自信、充满魅力
He's charming, sexy,
confident, incredibly hot.

424
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,968
但老实说，他是个坏小子
But let's be honest,
he's a bad boy, right?

425
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,130
跟你一样
Like you.

426
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:13,903
而现在我需要一个好男人
而不是一个…
And right now, I only need
good in my life, not someone who's--

427
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,674
被不幸的伤害，不再完整
无法摆脱自己心魔的人？
Tragically wounded and damaged
by demons he can't escape?

428
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:23,877
那些受伤的人
不是合适的对象
The damaged ones,
they're not good.

429
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,046
至少对我来说不是
At least, not for me.

430
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,094
我懂，真的懂
I understand, I do.

431
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,824
不管怎样，给他一次机会
However, give him one chance.

432
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,864
然后我需要你告诉我他去了哪里
见了谁
Then, I need you to tell me
where he goes and who he sees.

433
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,337
而这家伙
我会排干他体内的马鞭草
And this one.
I'm gonna drain him of vervain.

434
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:49,042
魅惑他相信他的兄弟找到了自己的信仰
搬去了犹他州
Compel him to believe his mates
found religion and moved to Utah,

435
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:53,947
这样他就能向马赛尔解释
为什么今晚又损失了三个吸血鬼
so that he can explain to Marcel
why he lost three more vampires tonight.

436
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:02,058
你们还有什么问题吗？
Does anyone have
any more questions?

437
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:07,060
没有？很好
因为我有个问题
No? Good.
Because I have a question.

438
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:11,233
海莉
首先，你在该死的法语区
Hayley, what were you doing,
in the bloody French Quarter,

439
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,768
干什么？
in the first place?

440
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,203
- 回答我
- 别管她了
-Answer me!
-Leave her be.

441
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,773
你想知道我干了什么？
You wanna know what I was doing?

442
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,811
我买了毒药
这样就可以让你的小宝贝解脱了
I was buying poison. So I could put
your little baby out of its misery.

443
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,043
尼克
Nik!

444
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,215
尼克
Nik!

445
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,523
放开她
看在老天的份上，她怀孕了
Keep your hands off her,
she is pregnant for God's sake!

446
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,291
所有关于不想要这个孩子的威吓
All of this bluster
about not wanting the child,

447
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,557
当她说准备好不要这个孩子的那一刻…
and then the second she tells
you she's ready to get rid of it....?

448
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,270
在意一个人没什么大不了的
It's okay to care.

449
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,208
想得到一些东西很正常
It's okay to want something.

450
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:56,577
这就是以利亚一直在努力的
这就是他对你的期望
That's all Elijah was trying to do,
all he's ever wanted for you.

451
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,377
也是我们一直想要的
All we've ever wanted.

452
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,370
我把以利亚交给了马赛尔
I gave Elijah to Marcel.

453
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,942
什么？
What?

454
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,574
马赛尔很紧张
Marcel was nervous.

455
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,076
一个真祖回来就很难对付了
更别说两个
Bad enough one Original
return to town, but two?

456
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,684
他的手下变得坐立不安
His crew was getting antsy.

457
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:45,993
他想要以利亚消失
所以我给了他一个和解的提议
He wanted Elijah gone,
so I gave him a peace offering.

458
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,927
你竟然拿我们的哥哥做交易
You bartered our brother.

459
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:50,033
我有计划
I have a plan.

460
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:55,835
得到马赛尔的信任，消灭他的帝国
Gain Marcel's trust,
dismantle his empire,

461
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,376
实现以利亚希望孩子出生的心愿
honor Elijah's wish
that that baby be born.

462
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,542
我的计划只有我自己清楚
I am executing that plan
the only way I know how.

463
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,318
如果你不喜欢
随时可以离开
If you don't like it,
there's the door.

464
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,316
看我在不在意
See if I care.

465
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,387
我知道你不怎么了解我，但还是谢谢
I know you don't know me very well,
but thanks.

466
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,786
非常感谢你刚才的举动
I appreciate what you did in there.

467
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:49,887
我们女孩不就应该互相照顾
Us girls have got to
look out for each other.

468
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:52,663
你们俩怎么了？
What is it with you two?

469
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:57,700
你说过你恨他
但你对待他的方式再明显不过了
You say you hate him, but the way
you deal with him it's so clear.

470
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,536
即使你恨他，你还是爱着他
Even when you hate him,
you still love him.

471
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,402
我想当你和一个人生活了千年
I guess when you spend
a thousand years with someone,

472
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:07,602
决定离开的时候
就像丢掉了自己的一部分
deciding to quit them is
like losing a part of yourself.

473
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,843
但有时这份恨意实在太强烈了
But sometimes the hate
is just so powerful.

474
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,081
被克劳斯杀掉的男朋友不只艾米尔一人
Emil wasn't the only boyfriend
of mine that Klaus killed.

475
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:24,285
他一次又一次地这么做
每当我找到心爱的人
He did it again and again, every
time I found someone to care about.

476
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:29,226
他就把对方杀死
直到我终于不再坠入爱河
He just kept doing it until,
finally, I stopped falling in love.

477
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,330
他说这是为了保护我，不让我犯错
He said he was protecting me
from my mistakes,

478
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,169
没有人能配得上他妹妹
that no one was ever good enough
for his little sister.

479
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:42,503
直到有一天他的出现
Until one day, someone was.

480
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,715
河水怎么样？
How was the river?

481
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,911
很凉爽，清甜
It was cool, sweet.

482
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,289
我该去…
I should go talk--

483
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,629
- 我哥哥会杀了你的
- 那我会笑着死去
-My brother will kill you.
-Then I'll die smiling.

484
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,298
我不是警告过你了吗？
Did I not warn you?

485
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,001
克劳斯，我求求你
他跟别人不一样
Klaus, I beg of you!
He's not like any other.

486
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,511
你第一眼见他时就知道了
You saw it in him
from the very first day.

487
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,809
你救了他
保护他
You saved him.
Protected him.

488
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,144
你抚养他长大
You raised him.

489
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,247
你不忍心杀他的
You cannot kill him.

490
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,967
你说得对
我不忍心
You are right, I cannot.

491
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,471
但是你，我亲爱的妹妹
But you, dear sister,

492
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:54,141
需要好好地上一课，让你懂得
不要随便抢走属于我的东西
need a lesson in what you can
and cannot take from me.

493
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,096
如果你知道以利亚在马赛尔手上
为什么不自己去把他救回来？
If you know Marcel has Elijah, why
don't you just get him back yourself?

494
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:08,960
因为如果激怒了我哥哥
我就会躺在楼下那个
Because if I cross my brother,
there's still a coffin downstairs

495
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,430
写着我名字的棺材里了
with my name on it.

496
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,878
天啊
Oh, my God.

497
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,020
我在你棺材底下找到的
I found them under your coffin.

498
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,188
如果这几把古董牛排刀
是唯一能阻止你
So, if a couple of antique steak
knives were the only thing stopping

499
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,557
救回以利亚的东西
那么你拿去吧
you from getting Elijah back,
then, here you go.

500
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:57,005
我让大家都提前下班了
I sent everyone home for the night.

501
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:59,911
今晚就让我来为你服务吧
I am your humble host.

502
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,952
好吧
风度翩翩加一分
Well, okay.
Extra points for flare.

503
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:05,714
美好的夜晚才刚开始
And the night's just started.

504
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,490
是什么让你决定赴约？
What made you decide to come?

505
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,525
每个人都值得有一次机会
Everyone deserves a chance.

506
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,896
你骗了我
我哥哥在哪里？
You lied to me.
Where's my brother?

507
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,094
你也好啊
卡蜜，这是蕾贝卡，蕾贝卡，这是卡蜜
Hello to you too.
Cami, Rebekah. Rebekah, Cami.

508
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,266
看得出你仍然对金发妞情有独钟
I see you still have
a thing for blondes.

509
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,533
嘿
Hey!

510
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,599
告诉我以利亚在哪
Tell me where Elijah is.

511
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,836
到底发生了什么事？
What the hell is going on?

512
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,412
告诉我他在哪，不然我杀了你
Tell me where he is
or I will kill you!

513
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,115
不，你不会的
No, you won't.

514
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,993
或许你说得对
Perhaps you're right.

515
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,733
但我会杀了她
But I will kill her.

516
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:54,232
放开她
你赢了
Let her go.
You won.

517
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:55,804
我带你去见以利亚
I'll take you to see Elijah.

518
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,737
你们到底是什么人？
What the hell are you people?

519
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,438
嘘…没事的
回家
Sh.... It's okay.
Go home.

520
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:08,117
忘了这一切，只要记得我会
好好补偿你的，我向你保证
Forget all this and just know that
I will make it up to you. I promise.

521
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,792
你想见以利亚？
好，跟我来
You want to see Elijah?
Fine, follow me.

522
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:30,931
邀请我进去
Invite me in.

523
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,634
那得问问屋子的女主人
黛维娜
Gotta ask the lady
of the house, Davina.

524
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,479
出来吧，亲爱的
Come on out, sweetheart.

525
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,145
邀请她进来
Invite her in.

526
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,587
请进
Come in.

527
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,658
我可不会这么做
I wouldn't do that.

528
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,129
你到底是谁？
Who the hell are you?

529
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,426
黛维娜
Davina.

530
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,768
她是真祖之一是不是？
She's an old one, isn't she?

531
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,303
没错，蕾贝卡是真祖
Yeah.
Rebekah is an Original.

532
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,033
也就是说她是杀不死的
Which means she can't be killed.

533
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:06,801
她好像也不太友善
She doesn't seem very nice.

534
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,778
她可以的
She can be.

535
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,949
只是今晚她对我不太好
But she hasn't been
very nice to me tonight.

536
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,013
那恐怕是时候送客了
Then I'm afraid
it's time for you to leave.

537
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,036
是时候了
Well, it's about time.

538
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:37,196
我都等得不耐烦了
I was bored waiting.

539
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:42,738
但又万般期待看到你的表情
因为绝对有趣
But I did so want to see your face
and it is, indeed, priceless.

540
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,542
你这混蛋
今天星期几？
You bastard.
What day is it?

541
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:47,440
星期天
Sunday.

542
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:49,313
我被匕首插了一个礼拜？
I have been daggered
for a whole week?

543
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,648
马赛尔，你把他怎么了？
Marcel, what have you done to him?

544
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,792
现在是1887年，蕾贝卡
It's 1887, Rebekah.

545
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,120
你被匕首插了52年
You've been daggered
for 52 years.

546
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,418
什么？
What?

547
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,623
不用担心马赛尔
我给了他一个选择
And don't worry about Marcel,
I presented him with a choice.

548
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,133
他可以选择拔掉你的匕首
和你共渡他
He could choose to undagger you and
live out the rest of his human days

549
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:07,828
- 凡人的余生，或是
- 不
-with you or....
-No.

550
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,473
我如他所愿把他变成吸血鬼
....I could turn him,
instead, as he's always wanted,

551
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,609
只要他放弃你
in exchange for giving you up.

552
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,104
不，他不会那么对我
No.
He wouldn't do that to me.

553
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,372
他放弃了
Oh, but he did.

554
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,993
欢迎回来，蕾贝卡
MARCEL: Welcome back, Rebekah.

555
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,690
你昏过去好一会儿了
You were out for quite a while.

556
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,031
我在哪里？
Where am l?

557
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,633
我怎么会在这里？
How'd I get here?

558
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,565
你惹恼黛维娜了
You upset Davina.

559
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:42,171
真高兴你们俩终于见面了
I'm glad you two finally got to meet.

560
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,171
现在你很清楚自己是跟谁做对了
Now, you know what
you're dealin' with.

561
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,773
这是我原来的房间
Is this my old room?

562
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,241
现在是我的了
It's mine, now.

563
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,904
就像这个城市是我的，黛维娜是我的
以利亚也是我的
Just like this town is mine,
Davina's mine and Elijah's mine,

564
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,846
直到我想放了他为止
until I feel like giving him back.

565
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,920
从前属于你，属于你哥的
现在都是我的了
What was once yours, what was
once your brother's, it's now mine.

566
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,858
还有不许再碰卡蜜
And don't ever touch Cami again.

567
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,490
我没喝那个
I didn't use it.

568
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,732
你醒了
You're awake.

569
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,005
我几乎整晚没睡
I could barely sleep all night.

570
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:52,074
这房子活像是沼泽地里的桑拿房
This house is like
a freaking swamp sauna.

571
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,479
你怎么放弃了？
What stopped you?

572
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,512
你本来可以摆脱这一切的
You could've been
free of all of this.

573
00:37:03,287 --> 00:37:04,686
摆脱我
Of me.

574
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,483
是啊，不过在我击退那些吸血鬼时
Yeah, well, when I was
fighting off those vampires,

575
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:11,856
我发觉我不光是在保护自己
I realized I wasn't
just protecting myself.

576
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,363
也许是因为我的亲生父母
遗弃了我
Maybe it has to do with the fact
that my birth-parents gave me up

577
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,869
而养父母又把我赶出家门的关系
and my adopted parents
kicked me out.

578
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:26,401
我只知道到了紧要关头
All I know is, push came to shove

579
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,707
我才意识到我不能让他受到丝毫伤害
and I realized
I wouldn't let anyone hurt it.

580
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:37,079
我开始觉得我们是同病相怜，你和我
I'm beginning to think
we're a lot alike, you and l.

581
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,350
我们都是被逼到走投无路时
We're both cast-offs
who've learned to fight

582
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,754
学会了反抗的废物
when we're backed into a corner.

583
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,623
我们已经被逼到走投无路了
Well, we're backed
into a corner now.

584
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,297
可不是
That we are.

585
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,126
是时候反抗了
It's time to fight...

586
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:55,802
小狼
...Little wolf.

587
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,212
和马赛尔之间的所有事
你和女巫的约定
This whole thing with Marcel,
the deal you have with the witches,

588
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:06,850
试图扳倒他，夺走他的一切
trying to take him down,
take what's his....

589
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,383
蕾贝卡告诉我
你和他曾像一家人那样相亲相爱
Rebekah told me that you two
once loved each other like family.

590
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,146
出什么事了？
What happened?

591
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:20,555
我造就了今日的马赛尔
I made Marcel everything that he is.

592
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,125
待他如亲生儿子
I treated him like a son.

593
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,068
但一百年前我父亲从纽奥良追杀我
And when my father chased me
and my family from New Orleans,

594
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:33,210
和我的家人的时候
我们以为马赛尔被杀了
a hundred years ago,
we believed Marcel was killed.

595
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:37,837
我们以各自的方式悼念了他
We each mourned him in our own way.

596
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:42,111
但当我再度归来
我才发现他不只是活了下来
Yet, when I returned,
I found not only had he survived,

597
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:43,753
还过得很好
he had thrived.

598
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:51,151
没想过要找到我们
也没想过要团结有如一家人
Instead of seeking us out,
instead of sticking together as one,

599
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:56,767
他选择了夺走我家族建立的一切
he made a choice to take
everything my family had built

600
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:58,561
据为己有
and make it his own.

601
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,129
如今他住我们的房子
睡在我们的床上
Now, he is living in our home,
he is sleeping in our beds.

602
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,400
他到处张贴“M”
That "M" he stamps everywhere....

603
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,241
这个M不是代表马赛尔
It's not for 'Marcel'.

604
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,241
它代表的是米卡森
it's for 'Mikaelson.'

605
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:19,312
我要夺回一切
I want it all back.

606
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:23,282
如果我得除掉他才能成功
And if I have to
push him out to get it,

607
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,395
那我正有此意
then that's exactly what I'll do.

608
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,935
我去找人来看看空调
I'll have someone see
to the air conditioning.

609
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:41,333
你说得对
You were right.

610
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,605
那个叫卡蜜的女孩是关键
The girl, Cami, she's the key.

611
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:45,806
马赛尔喜欢她，也因为如此
Marcel likes her and because of that,

612
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,884
我才见到了你总念念不忘的
他的秘密武器
I got to see this secret weapon of his
that you've been going on about.

613
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,419
那就别兜圈子了
是什么东西？
Well, don't stand on ceremony.
What is it?

614
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:55,616
不是东西，是人
一个叫黛维娜的女孩
It's not a "what", it's a "who."
A girl, Davina.

615
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,593
她不会超过16岁
我也从未成受过那样强大的力量
She can't be more than sixteen
and I've never felt power like that.

616
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,387
一个女巫
A witch.

617
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,295
她不是随便哪个女巫
她绝对是我前所未见
She's not just any witch.
She's something I've never seen before.

618
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,163
强大得无法估量的女巫
Something beyond powerful.

619
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,362
而且拜你所赐，以利亚在她手上
And now, because of you,
she has Elijah.

620
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,464
谁知道她能对他做什么
Who knows what she could do to him?

621
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,134
她在什么地方？
Where is she?

622
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,810
那个狡猾的小贱人
That clever bitch.

623
00:40:21,952 --> 00:40:23,112
我不知道
I don't know.

624
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,481
怎么回事？
What's wrong?

625
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,720
她把我对那个地点的记忆抹去了
She wiped my memory of the location.

626
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,018
马赛尔拥有一个
比真祖更法力无边的武器
Marcel possesses a weapon bigger
and more powerful than an Original

627
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,062
你却把我们的哥哥拱手给了他
and you handed our brother to him!

628
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,496
以利亚到底要原谅你多少次？
How many times will
Elijah forgive you?

629
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:40,398
到底还要多久他才会对
希望你得到救赎死心？
How long until his hope for
your redemption finally dies?

630
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,402
我是逼不得已的
I did what I had to do!

631
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,733
马赛尔抢走了我们的房子
Marcel took our home!

632
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:47,002
这房子没有家人就一文不值
And our home is worthless
without family.

633
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,173
我会找到以利亚
I am finding Elijah.

634
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,576
不计任何代价
Whatever it takes.

635
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,586
你会帮我吗？
Are you going to help me?

636
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:02,481
不计任何代价
Whatever it takes.

637
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,742
刚才的不愉快我很抱歉
I'm sorry about that unpleasantness.

638
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,201
她吓不了我
She doesn't scare me.

639
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:22,504
没人可以
None of them do.

640
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,113
我知道没人可以，亲爱的
I didn't think they would, honey.

641
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,943
但问题是，他们好像想留下
But the thing is,
it seems like they're here to stay.

642
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,712
他们不属于这里
They don't belong here.

643
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,650
要说服他们这一点恐怕不太容易
It might be kinda tough
to convince them of that.

644
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,485
所以我想请你帮个忙
Which is why I need to
ask you for a favor.

645
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:43,462
我希望你去弄清楚
我们怎样才能杀死真祖
I'm gonna need you to figure
out how we kill an Original.

646
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:52,499
