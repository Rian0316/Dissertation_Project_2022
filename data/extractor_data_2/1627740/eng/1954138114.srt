1
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:05,838
Okay, we've got power to the laser.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,341
I should've brought an umbrella.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,343
- What for? It's not gonna rain.
- I know.

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:16,348
But with skin as fair as mine,
moon burn is a real possibility.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,267
That's a buzzinga, right?

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,894
One of my best, don't you think?

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,525
Howard, double-check
the equatorial mount on the laser.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,695
- We need it locked on the Sea of Tranquility.
- You got it.

9
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,905
Raj, no.

10
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,867
Billions of dollars have gone
into inventing the Internet...

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:39,538
...and filling it with pictures of naked women
so we don't have to peep through windows.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,124
It's not like that.
I'm watching someone's TV.

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,417
The Good Wife is on.

14
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,048
I tell you,
this is my new Grey's Anatomy.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,717
Leonard, what is that? What is that?

16
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,054
Relax, it's just a dirty sock.

17
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:59,892
How on earth can you say "dirty sock"
and "relax" in the same sentence?

18
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,313
Sheldon, the world is filled
with dirty, discarded socks.

19
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,483
Not my world.

20
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,403
You know who'd really dig
seeing this experiment? Penny.

21
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,948
I wasn't aware that lunar ranging
was her thing.

22
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,158
Although I suppose...

23
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,036
...the retroreflector left on the moon
by Neil Armstrong...

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,497
...does qualify as a shiny object.

25
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:23,957
Ask her to come up.

26
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,418
I don't know. It's still weird since,
you know...

27
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,420
- She dumped you?
- She didn't dump me.

28
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:31,006
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

29
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,800
I fail to see how a relationship...

30
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,636
...can have the qualities
of a geographic location.

31
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:40,265
Well, it's very simple. Leonard was living
in a town called Please Don't Leave Me...

32
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,311
...while Penny had just moved
to the island of Bye-bye.

33
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,608
Screw you, guys.
I'm gonna go see if she's home.

34
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,279
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to point this at the moon now.

35
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,907
Wait a second.
The good wife is crying.

36
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,784
Something's very wrong.

37
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,440
Oh, hi. What's going on?

38
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:33,110
We're up on the roof
bouncing laser beams off the moon.

39
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,279
I'm sorry, what?

40
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:38,574
It's cool. We've got a two-meter
parabolic reflector and everything.

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,285
- I thought you might wanna see it.
- That makes no sense.

42
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,290
How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

43
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,002
Oh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.

44
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,087
- Hey.
- Sorry, I didn't know you were busy.

45
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,797
- Maybe another time.
- Yeah. Maybe.

46
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:56,884
- Hey, I wanna see this laser thing.
- Oh, what about the party?

47
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,304
It's a surprise party,
doesn't matter when we get there.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,056
Right.

49
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,892
Okay, well, yeah, come on up.

50
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,691
So how'd you guys meet?

51
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,153
My company designs the menus
for The Cheesecake Factory.

52
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,321
Your company?

53
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,324
My dad, but me and my sister are VPs.

54
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,327
So menus.

55
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,997
It sounds easy, but there's a lot of science
that goes into designing them.

56
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,215
Happy now? I'm moving the dirty sock.

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,843
Thank you.

58
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:42,679
Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.

59
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:46,016
- Hey, guys. This is my friend Zack.
Hey.

60
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:50,187
- Hello.
- Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

61
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,690
Yes. In 1917...

62
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,444
...when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

63
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,947
...in his paper
Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung...

64
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,660
...his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen. "

65
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,246
Well, mission accomplished.

66
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,000
Let me explain what we're doing here.

67
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,544
In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11...

68
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,505
...positioned reflectors on the moon.

69
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,715
We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

70
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,551
...and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

71
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,303
Oh, that's very cool.

72
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,391
One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

73
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,060
- The laser?
- The moon.

74
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,232
See, now this is a man for Penny.

75
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,903
- That's a great question, Zack.
- No, it's not.

76
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:43,407
- Sheldon, play nice.
- It's not a great question.

77
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,785
How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

78
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,998
That's a great question.

79
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,585
Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

80
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,754
Smart.

81
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,800
We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't
be strong enough when it comes back...

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,678
- ... to be seen by the naked eye.
- Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

83
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,601
Right, funny.

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,439
So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

85
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:18,775
...and show it to us on this computer.
Raj, get them some glasses.

86
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,570
Cool, it's gonna be in 3-D?

87
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,953
Preparing to fire laser at the moon.

88
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:31,455
Make it so.

89
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,170
There it is. There's the spike.

90
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:42,090
Two-point-five seconds for the light to
return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

91
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,306
That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

92
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,934
Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

93
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,438
The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

94
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,857
...that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

95
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,485
...put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

96
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,653
...had just invented the airplane.

97
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,655
What species is that?

98
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,036
I was wrong. Penny can do better.

99
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,581
- Okay, guys, thank you. It's been fun.
- Yeah, thanks.

100
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,626
- Should we invite them to the party?
- No, just keep walking.

101
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,837
He's must be very skilled at coitus.

102
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,008
I'm telling you, dude...

103
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,720
...the only way to feel better
about Penny going out with other guys...

104
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,224
...is for you to get back on the whores.

105
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,686
- Horse.
- What?

106
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:41,024
The phrase is "get back on the horse. "
Not whores.

107
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,527
That's disgusting, dude.

108
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,073
No, it's not... Never mind.

109
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,950
He is right, though.

110
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,370
If you want, I can turn you on
to this great new dating site I found.

111
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,579
No, thanks.

112
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,207
You sure? They say
they can find a match for anybody.

113
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,626
- Have they found a match for you?
- Tons.

114
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,878
I've had, like, eight dates
in the last month.

115
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:05,048
Twelve, if you count the ones
who showed up and left.

116
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:08,135
- I can't bring the nitrogen tank down.
- Why not?

117
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,555
All right, let me restate that.
It's very heavy and I don't want to.

118
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,517
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,562
Lift with your knees, not your back.

120
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,814
Good night.

121
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,901
You know what would be fun?

122
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,905
- Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
- Yeah, right.

123
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,158
No, think about it.
We make it an experiment.

124
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,120
Like when Frankenstein's monster
was lonely and he found a wife.

125
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,914
He didn't find a wife.

126
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,001
They built him a wife
out of dead body parts.

127
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,087
Okay, we'll call that plan B.

128
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,721
Coming.

129
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,143
Damn you, you rat bastard.

130
00:07:58,769 --> 00:07:59,936
Are you drunk?

131
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:03,523
Zack was a perfectly nice guy
and then you ruined him.

132
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,275
How did I ruin him?

133
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:09,821
Because in the olden days,
I never would've known he was so stupid.

134
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,785
- Come on, he wasn't that stupid.
- Yes, he was.

135
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,122
He thought you were
gonna blow up the moon.

136
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,292
Okay, yeah, he's stupid. Heh, heh.

137
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,793
He spent the entire night...

138
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:28,298
...bragging about how he invented
the word "appeteasers. "

139
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,136
How is that my fault?

140
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,097
You have destroyed my ability
to tolerate idiots.

141
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,474
Now, come with me.

142
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,893
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna have sex.

143
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,646
Why? I mean, okay.

144
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,815
What's going on?

145
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,819
Put on your noise-canceling headphones,
because it's gonna get loud.

146
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,242
Ugh. Not this again.

147
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:12,050
In what universe is this "low-pulp"?

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,346
Good morning, Penny.

149
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,015
Do you have eyes
in the back of your head?

150
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,643
When one gets beaten up
every other day in school...

151
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,854
...one, of necessity,
develops a keen sense of hearing.

152
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,191
Incidentally, one can get beaten up
in school...

153
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,236
...simply
by referring to oneself as "one. "

154
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,532
I'm making English muffins.
Would you like an English muffin?

155
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,950
Oh, thanks, I'm not hungry.

156
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,538
FYI, my noise-canceling headphones
proved ineffective last night.

157
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,667
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- As a native Texan, I must say...

158
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,254
...I've never heard the phrase "yeehaw"
used in quite that context.

159
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,090
Oh, God.

160
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,634
"Oh, God. "

161
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,554
That I've heard on multiple occasions.

162
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,645
In what universe is that "lightly toasted"?

163
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,151
This has to be the worst day of my life.

164
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,571
Good morning, Leonard.

165
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,948
How many times
have I asked you not to do that?

166
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,327
Counting this instance?
Three hundred seventeen.

167
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,998
- Where's Penny?
- She returned to her apartment.

168
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,125
I presume to shower and vomit.

169
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,919
Not necessarily in that order.

170
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,088
Wonder why she didn't say goodbye.

171
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,760
Are you expecting me to offer
an explanation of human behavior?

172
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,553
I know. I thought as an outsider...

173
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,181
...you might be able to provide
a fresh perspective.

174
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:49,105
Well, I have no difficulty
believing you are not butter.

175
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,985
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

176
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,781
- I gotta run. Early shift.
- Okay, I'll walk down with you.

177
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,908
So last night was fun, huh?

178
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,745
Yeah, it must've been.
I just threw up in my closet.

179
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,497
Bummer.

180
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,083
I was thinking tonight
maybe we could catch a movie.

181
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,335
Oh, yeah, tonight's not great for me.

182
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,297
Doesn't have to be tonight.
I'm free pretty much always.

183
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,133
Leonard, last night was a mistake.

184
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,261
When you say "mistake,"
do you mean a fortunate mistake...

185
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,139
...like the discovery of penicillin?

186
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,849
Look, I'm sorry.

187
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,644
I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack.

188
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,562
Can we just forget it ever happened?

189
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,816
No, it's pretty well imprinted on my brain.

190
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,818
Especially the whole rodeo thing.

191
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,653
Oh, God.

192
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,364
So that's it?
Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?

193
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,991
Look, I said I'm sorry.
Can't you please let it go?

194
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,328
How am I supposed to let it go?
You used me for sex.

195
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,000
Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.

196
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:55,922
Good morning, Leonard.
Or should I say "yeehaw"?

197
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,432
- Holy crap.
- What?

198
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,850
We finally have proof...

199
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,687
- ... that aliens walk among us.
- Excuse me?

200
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,523
The dating site
matched a woman with Sheldon.

201
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,151
You're kidding. An actual woman?

202
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,446
Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.

203
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,866
Trust me, breasts doesn't
necessarily mean "woman. "

204
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,909
- Since when?
- I'll show you a picture...

205
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,912
...of my Uncle Louie
in a bathing suit sometime.

206
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,543
Leonard, you gotta see this.
We found a match for Sheldon.

207
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,338
Great. Maybe she can have sex with him
and walk out on him the next morning...

208
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,216
...without so much
as a "How do you do?"

209
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,927
- Know what he's talking about?
- No. Ask him.

210
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,221
- Leonard, what?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

211
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:47,640
That was a lousy suggestion.

212
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:48,850
Whatever.

213
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:53,980
Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper
has to send an e-mail to his perfect match.

214
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:58,401
"Greetings, fellow life-form... "

215
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,114
If she can do it, I can do it.
If she can do it, I can do it.

216
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,074
If she can do it, I can do it.

217
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,410
I can't do it.

218
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,498
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. Hey.

219
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:12,832
Hi, Leslie.

220
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:16,252
Leonard, what're you doing here?

221
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,588
I know. It's been a while.

222
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,964
Yeah, 18 months.

223
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,342
Right. Right.

224
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,261
So how you doing?

225
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,932
- Fine. You?
- Not bad.

226
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,559
You remember
when we used to have sex...

227
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,521
...and you said it didn't mean anything,
it was just for fun?

228
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,314
Yeah.

229
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,775
Do you wanna do that again?

230
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,445
What happened? Blondie dumped you?

231
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,032
She didn't dump me. We were
just in different places in the relationship.

232
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,450
Right.

233
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:52,330
Anyway, apparently, it's okay to go back
to people you're no longer seeing...

234
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,458
- ... and have recreational sex with them.
- Uh-huh.

235
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,211
So, what do you say?

236
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,839
Let me think about it.

237
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,639
She's not coming back.

238
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,938
- Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
- Not us. Him.

239
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,691
Yes, but "him"
doesn't even know about "her. "

240
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,819
Well, "him" about to find out about "her. "

241
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,613
Really? Us gonna tell him?

242
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,824
Who's going to tell whom about what?

243
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,909
Sheldon. Hey. Hi.

244
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,830
Your surprise confuses me. I live here.

245
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,332
Right.

246
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,044
So, listen, what are you doing
tomorrow afternoon?

247
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,672
- Be more specific.
- Four-thirty.

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,383
That's not afternoon. That's preevning.

249
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,970
- What?
- It's a time of day I invented.

250
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,472
It better defines the ambiguous period...

251
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,018
...between afternoon and evening:
preevning.

252
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,771
Fairly certain it will catch on
as it fills a desperate need.

253
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,858
Right, okay. What are you doing
tomorrow preevning?

254
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,820
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.
Saturday night is laundry night.

255
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:10,700
So I'll be spending the preevning
pre-sorting and pre-soaking.

256
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,827
Okay, what if I were to tell you...

257
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,121
...tomorrow at 4:30,
you could meet a woman...

258
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,875
...who has been scientifically chosen
to be your perfect mate?

259
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,211
I would snort in derision
and throw my arms in the air...

260
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,548
...exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.

261
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,467
But it's true.

262
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,473
We put all your vital information
into this dating site...

263
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,976
...answered all questions like you would
and they found a match for you.

264
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,271
- Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.
- Please.

265
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,316
Even assuming you could answer
any question the way I would...

266
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,402
...the algorithms used
by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.

267
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,529
That's the answer
we gave to the question.

268
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,782
"What is your attitude
towards online dating?"

269
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,577
Well, Howard wanted to write
"mumbo jumbo," but I said no.

270
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,081
Our Sheldon would say "hokum. "

271
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,835
Come on,
where's your scientific curiosity?

272
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,922
Most of it is being applied to unraveling
secrets of universe...

273
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,717
...while the rest of it is wondering why
I'm having this conversation with you.

274
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,427
Okay, how about this?

275
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,931
Even Spock had a date
once every seven years.

276
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,225
He didn't date. It was pon farr.

277
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,811
His blood boiled with mating lust.

278
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,689
Why don't you start
with a cup of coffee...

279
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,109
...and you can pon farr
Amy Farrah Fowler later.

280
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,654
- I don't drink coffee.
- All right, you can have a hot chocolate.

281
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,616
As I will not be engaging in this nonsense,
my choice of beverage is moot.

282
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,827
For the record,
I only drink hot chocolate...

283
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,121
...in months with an R in them.

284
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,208
- Why?
- What's life without whimsy?

285
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,295
Okay, I'm out.

286
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,928
Sheldon...

287
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,557
...I've hidden the dirty sock from the roof
somewhere in your apartment.

288
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,061
Unless you're willing
to come with us to meet this girl...

289
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:05,398
...it will remain there forever.

290
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,026
You're bluffing.

291
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,070
Are you willing to risk it?

292
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,365
Curse you.

293
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,056
Thirty feet.

294
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,523
Oh. Hey, Leonard.

295
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,944
I was a perfectly happy,
geeky, little lonely guy...

296
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,030
...and then you ruined me.

297
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:55,865
Are you drunk?

298
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,035
Come on. We're gonna have sex
and it's not gonna mean a thing.

299
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,413
Are you out of your mind?

300
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,211
I'm really starting to think
there's a double standard here.

301
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,303
In a few minutes, when I gloat
over the failure of this enterprise...

302
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,556
...how would you prefer I do it?
The standard "I told you so"?

303
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,058
With a classic "neener-neener"?

304
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,686
Or just my normal look
of haughty derision?

305
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,067
- You don't know we're wrong yet.
- Haughty derision it is.

306
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,822
Excuse me. I'm Amy Farrah Fowler.
You're Sheldon Cooper.

307
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,698
Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler.

308
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,409
I'm sorry to inform you
that you have been taken in...

309
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,161
...by unsupportable mathematics...

310
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,664
...designed to prey
on the gullible and the lonely.

311
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,751
Additionally, I'm being blackmailed
with a hidden dirty sock.

312
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,754
If that was slang, I'm unfamiliar with it.

313
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,592
If it was literal,
I share your aversion to soiled hosiery.

314
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,348
I'm here because my mother and I have
agreed that I will date at least once a year.

315
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,558
Interesting.

316
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,019
My mother and I have
the same agreement about church.

317
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:10,606
I don't object to the concept of a deity,
but I'm baffled by the notion...

318
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,483
...of one that takes attendance.

319
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,279
Well, then you might
want to avoid East Texas.

320
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,991
Noted. Now, before this goes any further,
you should know...

321
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,620
...that all forms of physical contact
up to and including coitus are off the table.

322
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:28,833
May I buy you a beverage?

323
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,961
Tepid water, please.

324
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,471
Good God, what have we done?
