1
00:00:04,396 --> 00:00:05,731
Hey, back up.

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,691
What do I look like,
the information lady?

3
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:10,235
Hell, no.
I'm a law enforcement officer,

4
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:11,570
emphasis on the enforcement.

5
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:13,715
You need to know what happened
last week on Shameless?

6
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:16,158
Better go find someone
who actually gives a shit.

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,784
Rock music

8
00:00:17,826 --> 00:00:19,369
[insistent knocking]

9
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,829
[Kev] City of Chicago says

10
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:23,415
all bars are closed
until further notice.

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,126
Hail, 'rona survivors!
Where is everyone?

12
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:28,337
The mayor shut us all down
again on Tuesday.

13
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,547
Well, who the hell
can keep track?

14
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,215
[Lip] I made a big mistake, son.

15
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,401
I rented this house
without asking

16
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:34,384
your mommy first,

17
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:36,428
and now I'm basically her bitch.

18
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,472
[Frank] Holy shit!

19
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:39,556
What the hell is that?

20
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:40,474
[Veronica] Hands off, Frank.

21
00:00:40,515 --> 00:00:41,600
We're not offering credit

22
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,227
on cannabis products.
Payment up front only.

23
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:45,496
Debbie needs her share
of the utilities.

24
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,022
Want me to get some shitty-ass

25
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:48,023
minimum-wage job like you,

26
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:49,208
hauling boxes
around a warehouse?

27
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:50,901
[Ian] What the fuck is this?

28
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,319
I go and get our money,

29
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,404
all I find is IOUs.

30
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,365
You spent all our money
from the wedding?

31
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,283
Did you eat all the brownies?

32
00:00:58,325 --> 00:00:59,576
I had three,

33
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,328
and Tommy had four.

34
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,412
We were hungry.

35
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,393
With the loss of
so many officers to the 'rona,

36
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:09,187
the bosses are willing
to put you on the street.

37
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:10,396
It's not a tough call
to give you a badge.

38
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,339
Busting heads is a man's job,

39
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:14,383
and you are a natural born
ass kicker.

40
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:15,425
[grunts]

41
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:16,736
[Ruger]
Congratulations, Gallagher.

42
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,488
You're gonna get to be one
of the best of the best,

43
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,098
a goddamn Chicago
police officer.

44
00:01:21,139 --> 00:01:23,725
Thank you, sir.

45
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:32,150
Rock music

46
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:38,907
Think of all the luck you got

47
00:01:38,949 --> 00:01:42,327
Know that it's not for naught

48
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,414
You were beaming once before

49
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:49,751
But it's not like that anymore

50
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:53,338
What is this downside

51
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,633
That you speak of?

52
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,677
What is this feeling

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,097
You're so sure of?

54
00:02:09,938 --> 00:02:13,692
Round up the friends you got

55
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,695
Know that they're not for naught

56
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,740
You were willing once before

57
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:24,411
But it's not like that anymore

58
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:27,581
What is this downside

59
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:31,126
That you speak of?

60
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:33,253
What is this feeling

61
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,299
You're so sure of?

Rock music

63
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:47,726
Watch out, crackheads.
Coming back for you later.

64
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:50,604
Making a mental note
of your face, shitbag.

65
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,527
Watch it, ladies.

66
00:02:57,569 --> 00:02:58,963
Might haul your asses
down to the station.

67
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:01,239
Yeah, that's right.
You're looking at the po-po.

68
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,116
First day on the job.

69
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,332
My birthday!

70
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:16,671
Wake up! [knocks]

71
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,967
Wake up! I'm five!

72
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:25,388
[Lip] Hey, hey. Look who it is.

73
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:29,184
The birthday girl.
[sniffles, sighs]

74
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,396
Presents?

75
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:34,356
Oh, no, no.

76
00:03:34,397 --> 00:03:35,541
It's not like Christmas, Franny.

77
00:03:35,565 --> 00:03:36,626
You're gonna get your presents

78
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,943
tonight at your party.

79
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:39,152
Oh.

80
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:39,986
Hey.

81
00:03:40,028 --> 00:03:41,238
Come on.

82
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,240
Let's go make some breakfast,
huh?

83
00:03:43,281 --> 00:03:45,450
[whooshes]

84
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:46,535
Whoof!

85
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,286
Go sit!

86
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:49,287
Yo, what up?

87
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,789
Why'd you guys
sleep here last night?

88
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,123
Oh, the fumes at our new place

89
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,583
from resurfacing the bathtub.

90
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,085
Good morning, Franny.
Happy birthday.

91
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,169
Thank you.

92
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:57,337
[Lip] These up for grabs?

93
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:58,588
- No, don't touch.
- Why?

94
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,525
I'm gonna sell them for cheap
to the lunch debt kids.

95
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,800
What's a lunch debt kid?

96
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,820
[Liam] Kids who run out
of money on their food account.

97
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,513
Can't eat the hot lunch
till they pay up.

98
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:07,764
Is that even legal?

99
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,599
Don't public schools
have to feed the kids?

100
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:11,977
Yeah, but the lunch lady
serves them gross shit

101
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,395
like stale bread,

102
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,105
government cheese,
chunky pudding.

103
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,566
So you're capitalizing
on the misfortunes of others

104
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,609
by selling them
your peanut butter sandwiches?

105
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,778
The American way. See you.

106
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,156
Hey, there's
my sweet birthday princess!

107
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,658
Who is five today?

108
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,868
- Me!
- [Debbie] You? Ah!

109
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:31,538
I don't know!
She looks like a big girl.

110
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,831
Did you grow overnight?

111
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:34,749
Are you sure you're not 15?

112
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:35,834
I am! I am!

113
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,460
[Sandy] Yeah, I knew you were.

114
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,462
Are you excited
for your princess party?

115
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:40,839
I hate princesses!

116
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,382
What? No, you don't.

117
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:43,967
I'm with Frans on this one.

118
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:46,511
Hey, no.
I invited your entire class.

119
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,971
There's gonna be a bouncy house.

120
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:49,890
We're gonna get
a bunch of decorations

121
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,531
at the dollar store.
It's gonna be great.

122
00:04:51,558 --> 00:04:52,952
Hey, can I tag along
to the dollar store?

123
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:55,145
- Sure.
- Homeboy needs more diapers.

124
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:57,856
- Is that me?
- Yeah.

125
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,400
Hey, hey, hey, birthday Franny.

126
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:02,694
Hey, look what I got you
from work.

127
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,530
They let us keep stuff if it's
past its expiration date.

128
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:06,883
There's so much stuff
that just gets

129
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:08,283
thrown away into a dumpster.

130
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,076
Oh, great job, man.
Free old cereal.

131
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:12,329
[Ian] Yeah, at least I have
a real job.

132
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,663
Get off my back.

133
00:05:13,705 --> 00:05:15,123
Hey, Debs, I'm finally gonna get

134
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,708
my first paycheck later,

135
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,752
so I can start paying
for my part of the bills.

136
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:20,045
- [Debbie] Great.
- Wait, what?

137
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:21,397
I didn't plan on supporting
a husband.

138
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,481
You gotta pull your weight.

139
00:05:22,505 --> 00:05:24,174
I told you, I am still
on my honeymoon.

140
00:05:24,215 --> 00:05:26,426
We need money for food, rent.

141
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:27,486
Great. I could go get money

142
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,553
in 30 fucking seconds.

143
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,596
Legal money.

144
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,865
Look, they're hiring
over at my warehouse.

145
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,449
You could go over there today
and apply.

146
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,017
Thanks, no thanks.

147
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,536
All right, if you don't get
a real job today,

148
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,103
you're not getting any more sex.

149
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:38,146
[Lip] Whoo-hoo!

150
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:39,105
[Mickey] Oh, no, please.

151
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:40,106
I don't give a shit, man.

152
00:05:40,148 --> 00:05:42,150
I don't need
your disgusting-ass dick.

153
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,568
[laughter]

154
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,321
Ah, you guys been married what,
like, 50 years now?

155
00:05:46,363 --> 00:05:47,864
- 5-0!
- Oh, fuck, it's the cops!

156
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:49,746
- Hey, I'm unarmed!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

157
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,952
Ha, ha, ha, very funny,
assholes.

158
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:53,620
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'ma go load

159
00:05:53,662 --> 00:05:55,580
these bad boys up
with armor-piercing rounds

160
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:57,499
so I can keep
the mean streets safe

161
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,417
for fuck-heads like you guys.

162
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,585
Watch out, Chicago!

163
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,796
You're going down.

164
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,509
- Here you go, Kerm.
- Thanks, Kev.

165
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,095
May there be many more
where this comes from.

166
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,973
[knocking at door]

167
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:20,355
Hey, Tommy.

168
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:22,148
Kev.

169
00:06:25,276 --> 00:06:26,695
Kermit.

170
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:28,154
Tommy.

171
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,122
Why are you two sitting
so far apart from each other?

172
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,708
- Social distancing.
- Take a beer, Kev.

173
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:41,793
Yeah, sure, of course.

174
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:44,879
[Veronica] Okay, call me
when you have more.

175
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:46,589
Elijah from the dispensary

176
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:48,008
doesn't have weed either, Kev.

177
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:48,675
Shit.

178
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:50,468
Whole city's run out.

179
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,804
Another symptom
of economic anxiety:

180
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:55,890
everyone's self-medicating.

181
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,642
Why are you two sitting apart?

182
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,477
- No reason.
- Nothing.

183
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,771
[quietly] I think
they're having a fight.

184
00:07:01,813 --> 00:07:03,857
A fight? About what?

185
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:05,775
[Kev] Saying something
under your breath means

186
00:07:05,817 --> 00:07:07,318
"keep it quiet."

187
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,446
[Frank] Hello! I'm here.

188
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,865
Oh, Frank!

189
00:07:11,906 --> 00:07:14,242
You gotta use the secret knock.

190
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,619
Oh, sorry.

191
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:18,496
Top of the morning to you.

192
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,999
So what you got for me
to sample today

193
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,959
in the wonderful world of weed,

194
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:26,796
Master Kev, Mistress V?

195
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:29,340
What are... why are you guys
sitting so far apart?

196
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,526
One of you fart or something?

197
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,427
- Just because.
- Stop asking.

198
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:33,511
Jesus, fine.

199
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,847
Sit in your own stank,
for all I care.

200
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,724
[Veronica]
They won't tell us either.

201
00:07:37,766 --> 00:07:39,768
Oh.

202
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:40,894
Where are the goods?

203
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,187
[Veronica] Sold out.

204
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,521
Impressive.

205
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,273
But our suppliers
are out of product now.

206
00:07:45,315 --> 00:07:47,817
Ever since the 'rona,
there's been a rush on weed.

207
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,045
They were not prepared
for the demand.

208
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,987
- Everyone's out.
- It's a blessing in disguise.

209
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,947
- Pot is dangerous.
- Amen to that.

210
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

211
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:56,117
That's impossible.
There's no such thing

212
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,703
as a rush on weed.
It's in abundance.

213
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,056
There's
three different dispensaries

214
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,290
- we use for our product.
- [Kev] They're all out.

215
00:08:02,332 --> 00:08:03,166
Dispensaries?

216
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,336
You know what kind
of a markup they've got?

217
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,129
I can get you more product.

218
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:08,880
Where?

219
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,131
Yeah, illegal shit.

220
00:08:10,173 --> 00:08:12,509
Marijuana's
basically just a weed.

221
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,968
The government has no more right

222
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,304
to regulate it
than they do sunflowers.

223
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:17,806
Or making us wear masks.

224
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:19,015
Exactly!

225
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:21,893
Don't worry.
I can get you more product.

226
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:24,437
We can go in on this
together, partners.

227
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,397
- Yes.
- No!

228
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:30,318
[whispering] I am not going
into the weed business

229
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,528
with Frank Gallagher.

230
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:32,963
Frank Gallagher's
the best person to go

231
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:34,131
- in the weed business with.
- Shh.

232
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:35,966
I was whispering so that
means to talk quietly.

233
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,051
Well, now you know how it feels.

234
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,994
Veronica, I understand
your reluctance.

235
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:42,789
I would feel the same
if I were going

236
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:44,249
into business with me.

237
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,877
May I suggest we do
a trial run today?

238
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,338
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

239
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,923
I will find you weed,

240
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,884
I will teach you how to make
the best edibles in the city,

241
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:58,555
and then I will help you
sell those edibles

242
00:08:58,596 --> 00:08:59,848
at a premium.

243
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:02,809
I was born to do this.

244
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,230
I've been training for it
my whole fucking life.

245
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:11,526
Frank Gallagher really is
an illegal drug connoisseur, V.

246
00:09:13,528 --> 00:09:15,864
Fine, a trial run
just for today.

247
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:18,449
Elijah should have
some legal product in stock

248
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,659
in a couple of days.

249
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,494
You will not regret this.

250
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,538
- [sprays disinfectant]
- Oh.

251
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,290
[laughs]

252
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,666
Nah, it's...

253
00:09:28,877 --> 00:09:31,838
brassy music

254
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,022
[applause]

255
00:09:49,063 --> 00:09:50,166
[Tipping] Look at those virgins.

256
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,108
This is the freshest meat
I've ever seen.

257
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,152
[Simmons] Yanez, over here.

258
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,070
I'ma Denzel Washington
your ass today.

259
00:09:56,112 --> 00:09:58,448
Officer Tipping, Carl Gallagher.

260
00:09:58,489 --> 00:09:59,407
I believe I'm your partner.

261
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,868
Stand down, son.
No need for formality.

262
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,703
- Bring it in.
- Uh, really?

263
00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:05,139
We've all been tested.
You wouldn't be here

264
00:10:05,163 --> 00:10:06,915
if you were positive.
Now bring it in.

265
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,082
[patting]

266
00:10:08,124 --> 00:10:10,793
Welcome to the Chicago
police force.

267
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:13,588
[tires screeching]

268
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,425
- [engine turns over]
- [siren wails]

269
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:19,219
[Lip] All right, first thing
we're gonna do:

270
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,678
we're gonna open up
all the windows,

271
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,364
air out the house.
That way, we don't inhale

272
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,598
any of the fumes.

273
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,641
It's a good idea, right?

274
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:26,100
"Yeah, Daddy. You're brilliant."

275
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,727
I know. Then we're gonna count

276
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:28,996
all the mismatched
light switches,

277
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,372
see which ones
need to be replaced,

278
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,191
and I need you
on bathroom tile duty.

279
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,776
Think you can do that for me?

280
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,612
Go through and see
where I need to add more grout.

281
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:38,905
"Yeah, Daddy." You can?

282
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:42,450
Well, that's great.
Thank you so much, buddy.

283
00:10:42,492 --> 00:10:45,078
What the actual fuck?

284
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:57,131
[applause on television]

285
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,442
[Drew Carey]
Now you're probably wondering,

286
00:10:58,466 --> 00:11:00,093
"Why do they call it
'More or Less'?"

287
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,237
- Here's why.
- [contestant] Okay.

288
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,595
[Drew Carey]
We're gonna start off

289
00:11:02,637 --> 00:11:03,930
with these wireless speakers,

290
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:04,973
four of them.

291
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:05,932
$450.

292
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,517
Is the actual price

293
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:08,893
more or less than $450...

294
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,895
Who cares how much
the speakers cost?

295
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,981
Just steal 'em.

296
00:11:13,022 --> 00:11:15,817
[TV character] Is...
Is this a problem?

297
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,943
Okay.

298
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:18,665
[TV character 2]
I won't tell if you won't.

299
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,321
[Mickey] Shit, yeah.

300
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:22,282
[laughs]

301
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:24,009
Oh, come on, man.
I need more time than that.

302
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,868
What are you doing
sitting on the couch?

303
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,578
Watching TV? Wasting your life?

304
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,705
I'm not wasting my life.

305
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:29,747
Do you even have a job?

306
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,999
Do you have a college degree?

307
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,959
No, you don't, do you? Why not?

308
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,895
'Cause everything's
an excuse with you, isn't it?

309
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,272
Why don't you mind your own
fucking business, Jerome?

310
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:38,089
"I'll apply to school
next year."

311
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,299
What's wrong with right now?

312
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,135
Stop disappointing
the people you love.

313
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:43,261
Get off the couch

314
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,321
and go make something
of yourself.

315
00:11:44,345 --> 00:11:45,555
All... all right, okay. Fuck.

316
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:46,991
[Jerome] Consider me
like your guardian angel.

317
00:11:47,015 --> 00:11:47,890
Fine.

318
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,100
You can thank me later.

319
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,436
Now call or email us today.

320
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,314
- Do it!
- Shut the fuck up, Jerome.

321
00:12:02,572 --> 00:12:04,157
This stuff's all expired.

322
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:05,658
Toss it in the dumpster.

323
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,703
[Spanish music playing]

324
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,289
Those guys have it made, huh?

325
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,207
Sitting on their asses all day.

326
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,792
[George] You're telling me.

327
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,020
You know they make
ten bucks more an hour

328
00:12:16,044 --> 00:12:17,045
than we do, don't you?

329
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,046
Oh, shit.

330
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:19,464
Yeah.

331
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,841
How do I apply to be
a forklift driver?

332
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,217
[George] Well, you don't,

333
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,844
unless you're Black,

334
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:25,928
or you're Mexican,

335
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,722
or you got a twat
between your legs.

336
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,390
You got a twat
between your legs?

337
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,100
Uh, not the last time I checked.

338
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,269
The days are over
when guys like you and me

339
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,980
got all the opportunities
for advancement.

340
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:38,941
Sucks to be a white male
in America these days.

341
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,828
Life Saver?

342
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,413
- Huh?
- Wintergreen.

343
00:12:52,455 --> 00:12:55,041
Yeah, sure. [clears throat]

344
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,751
So I made a list
of everything that I saw

345
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,086
in my neighborhood this morning.

346
00:12:58,127 --> 00:12:59,295
Lot of illegal activity.

347
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:01,255
Guns, drugs, car theft.

348
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,257
You ever bite one of these
in the dark

349
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:04,384
using your back teeth?

350
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:06,344
- Excuse me?
- The Life Saver.

351
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,179
Uh, no, not that I know of,

352
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,074
but I was thinking that
we could drive by the area.

353
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:11,116
You know, there's still probably

354
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,225
a lot of activity going on.

355
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:13,351
Maybe bust some heads

356
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,995
and drag some bangers
down to the station.

357
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:16,187
Makes a spark

358
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:18,147
when you bite the Life Saver
in the dark.

359
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:19,399
I do it for my kids sometimes.

360
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,150
They get a real kick out of it.

361
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,069
- You have kids?
- I'm 19.

362
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,338
[Tipping] About when I started.

363
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,572
I have a 17 year old
gonna start community college,

364
00:13:26,614 --> 00:13:29,200
and twin eight year olds
with the second wife.

365
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,910
She's not much older than you.

366
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:33,162
You wanna check this out, sir?
You know...

367
00:13:33,204 --> 00:13:36,457
take a look at the list
for yourself?

368
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,713
Well, if you bust a right
down here on Cermak,

369
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,840
go down about three blocks,

370
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:44,900
you still might see some
of those guys...

371
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,360
Let me share some things
with you, Carl.

372
00:13:46,384 --> 00:13:48,177
I've been on the police force
15 years.

373
00:13:48,219 --> 00:13:50,721
Do you know how many times
I've been shot?

374
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,889
I don't know. Five?

375
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:52,723
Zero.

376
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,867
Wait, you've never been shot?

377
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,560
Never been shot, never shot at.

378
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,936
You know why?

379
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,604
I don't leave the car.

380
00:13:58,646 --> 00:13:59,856
Seriously?

381
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:01,357
Personal safety
is no joking matter.

382
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,192
What if something's going on
out there,

383
00:14:03,234 --> 00:14:04,294
like, you know, the street?

384
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,421
Carl, we can do more
for the neighborhood

385
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,839
by staying right here
inside this car

386
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,781
and being a presence.

387
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:10,926
So you're not gonna do anything
about those prostitutes

388
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,742
over there?

389
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:12,869
[Tipping] Do you see blood?

390
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,662
- No.
- Anyone crying,

391
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:15,663
begging for their life?

392
00:14:15,705 --> 00:14:16,664
Not that I can see.

393
00:14:16,706 --> 00:14:18,267
[Tipping] Then we let them know
we're here...

394
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,167
[honks horn]

395
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,751
...and we go on our way.

396
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,838
[sighs] Okay.

397
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,007
Another Life Saver?

398
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:31,053
Are we seriously gonna buy
illegal weed

399
00:14:31,095 --> 00:14:32,847
from some random dude
on the street?

400
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:34,765
They're not random.

401
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,184
That's Scotty in the beanie.

402
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,019
Lori L. on the stoop.

403
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,246
That guy doing ballet over there

404
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,646
probably has some good stuff.

405
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:41,731
[Frank] Who, Herman?

406
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,274
Yeah, his product isn't bad,

407
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:44,442
when he has it.

408
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,527
Usually by mid-morning,
he's smoked it all up.

409
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:49,614
On disability.
Got hit by an Uber.

410
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,158
Tiny Tod over there
has the cheapest weed,

411
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,160
but it's mostly stems.

412
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:56,454
I don't know about this.

413
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,456
These folks aren't doing
any harm.

414
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,249
It's the law-abiding rich people

415
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,293
who decided
to legalize marijuana

416
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,586
who are messing up a system

417
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:05,963
that's been in place
for decades.

418
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:08,216
Trust me, these folks
have good product.

419
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:10,718
Upbeat music

420
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,887
Let's buy from Gina.

421
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:14,305
[Kev] Who, Twitchy McGee?

422
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:17,183
[Frank] Exactly. She's jonesing.

423
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:20,186
Probably H. She's desperate.

424
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:21,437
Has to score soon,

425
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,147
so she'll want to make
a quick sale.

426
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:24,815
[car alarm wails]

427
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,150
All right, I'm going in.

428
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:27,318
Cash, please.

429
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,154
Better not run away
with our money, Frank.

430
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,324
Veronica, please.

431
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:35,076
This is good.

432
00:15:35,117 --> 00:15:36,702
This'll probably get us
four ounces.

433
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:37,954
Then back to your place.

434
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,288
We'll cook up some goodies.

435
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:46,587
What happened?

436
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,172
We never talked about our split.

437
00:15:48,214 --> 00:15:49,090
What split?

438
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,132
As business partners.

439
00:15:50,174 --> 00:15:51,276
Temporary business partners.

440
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,219
I think 50/50's fair.

441
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:54,345
Sounds reasonable to me.

442
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,447
Fuck that. There's two of us

443
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,098
and one of you.
A three-way split.

444
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,934
Sounds reasonable to me.

445
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:02,728
Got yourselves a deal. Partners.

446
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,230
Go get 'em, tiger.

447
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,442
[Frank] Gina, did you miss me?

448
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,988
[music playing faintly]

449
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:15,866
Ooh, they have tiaras
and magic wands.

450
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:21,038
You guys, where are you?
They have fairy dust.

451
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,290
[Tami] En garde!

452
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,166
Take that, bad guy.

453
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,253
Ah, this is my land.
You'll never win the battle.

454
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:28,337
[both grunting]

455
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,297
Get her, Franny.

456
00:16:29,338 --> 00:16:30,548
I got her! I got her!

457
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,634
Look, I can dress like a
unicorn princess for the party.

458
00:16:33,676 --> 00:16:36,012
Huh?

459
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,221
Hi-yah!

460
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,307
- [cell phone rings]
- Oh.

461
00:16:39,348 --> 00:16:40,558
Hi, babe.

462
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,061
Uh, your sister is going psycho
for the princess crap.

463
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,688
Uh, hey.
So, um, you know how you're mad

464
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,583
I'm spending a lot of money
we don't have on the house?

465
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:50,568
Yes. Accept defeat, warrior!

466
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,321
Well, someone broke
our two front windows.

467
00:16:53,362 --> 00:16:55,448
What the serious fuck?

468
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:56,782
[Lip] That's what I said.

469
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:00,369
How do we feel about
this mermaid princess look?

470
00:17:00,411 --> 00:17:02,538
Uh, okay, so we gotta call
the cops.

471
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,041
No, the cops won't do anything
about a broken window.

472
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,000
We'd have to lie and tell them

473
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,418
there was a murder or something.

474
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,253
Hey. Why are you hitting me?

475
00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:12,214
She switched sides.
Us against you now.

476
00:17:12,256 --> 00:17:14,383
So I was thinking I'm gonna
change out the windows,

477
00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:16,552
and, uh, I was actually
gonna replace them

478
00:17:16,594 --> 00:17:18,638
- with double glaze anyway.
- [Tami] Double glaze?

479
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:20,014
They more expensive
than regular?

480
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,390
Okay, stop.
This is the safe zone.

481
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:23,601
I am in the safe zone.
Do not come closer.

482
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:26,062
That sounds expensive, Lip.
Is it?

483
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:28,731
A little bit. Not much.

484
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:31,108
[Tami] Ugh, we gotta stop
hemorrhaging money.

485
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,318
[clattering sound]

486
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,862
[engine roaring,
tires screeching]

487
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:35,988
Oh, come on!

488
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,448
I'm just saying we're spending...

489
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,700
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
I wasn't talking to you.

490
00:17:41,202 --> 00:17:43,371
[grunts]

491
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,414
Someone just dumped
a bunch of trash

492
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,708
in our new yard
and in our planters.

493
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,085
Why?

494
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:51,128
I don't know.
I don't see anyone.

495
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,464
It must've been
some punk-ass kids.

496
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,132
I gotta put a sign up,
let people know...

497
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,717
[shouting]
...a Gallagher lives here!

498
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,302
Then they won't mess
with us anymore.

499
00:17:58,344 --> 00:17:59,488
[Tami, incredulously]
Yeah, okay.

500
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,806
Um, how's Fred?

501
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,432
Oh, uh, good.

502
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,226
Good. Happy. Good.

503
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,227
I gotta go. Bye!

504
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:08,604
- Bye.
- [Debbie] Okay, I found it.

505
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:10,648
I'll be a fairy princess
for the party.

506
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,192
Isn't this the perfect dress?

507
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:20,074
So you worked five years
at Home Depot,

508
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:21,534
three at Lowe's,

509
00:18:21,575 --> 00:18:24,120
and served two active duties
in Afghanistan.

510
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,497
- Yep.
- Impressive.

511
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:27,873
[clears throat]

512
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,917
Oh, shit.

513
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:32,628
Whoops. Uh, you forgot to put

514
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,005
your Social Security number
on the application.

515
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:36,924
Yeah, it's, uh,

516
00:18:36,966 --> 00:18:40,219
three... seven... 22.

517
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:41,971
That's only four numbers.

518
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:44,181
How many is it supposed to be?

519
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,766
Why don't you just
text it to me later?

520
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:48,185
- Yeah.
- So Mr. Milkovich,

521
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,854
let's do a little role-play.

522
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,439
Oh, I'm not
into that shit anymore.

523
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,606
I got married.

524
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:55,276
[laughs] No, no.
Professional role-play.

525
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,628
- Oh, yeah.
- [interviewer] Let's say

526
00:18:56,652 --> 00:18:58,463
you're working at the register.
[clears throat]

527
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:00,990
I'm a customer who comes in,
and I wanna return a saw.

528
00:19:01,031 --> 00:19:03,909
What are some questions
you might wanna ask me?

529
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:06,454
Okay. Uh...

530
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:08,122
How many times you use it?

531
00:19:08,164 --> 00:19:09,290
Where'd you steal that from?

532
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:10,416
You think you can scam me?

533
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,727
[shouting] You think
I'm fucking stupid?

534
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,669
Is there blood on that shit?

535
00:19:13,711 --> 00:19:16,422
Uh, not exactly
what I was looking for.

536
00:19:16,464 --> 00:19:17,715
Hey, okay. You know, hey.

537
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,568
I-I'm really good at scaring
the crap out of people,

538
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,552
so I can say whatever
you want me to say

539
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,388
so people stop returning shit.

540
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,390
Good... good to know.

541
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:28,058
Maybe dealing directly
with the customers

542
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,853
is not the best job for you.

543
00:19:30,895 --> 00:19:33,439
Look...

544
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:37,359
I-I really want
to make it work here, so...

545
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:40,905
W-w-what are they doing?
Can I do that job?

546
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,699
Oh, yeah.
Inspecting the expiration dates

547
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:44,992
on our stored food supply.

548
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:47,536
Anything doesn't meet
our high standard of freshness

549
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:49,246
is disposed of.

550
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,373
- So thrown out?
- [interviewer] That's right.

551
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,559
Why don't you just tell me
a little bit more

552
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:53,834
about yourself?

553
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,170
What assets do you think
you bring to the workplace?

554
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:57,296
Bro, I can bring whatever

555
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,523
you fucking want
to the workplace.

556
00:19:58,547 --> 00:20:00,257
I got, like...
What... what do you need?

557
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,635
Glocks? Nunchucks?
Fuck, I got bayonets.

558
00:20:02,676 --> 00:20:04,678
I got whatever you want.
I got you...

559
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,598
Or I know who does, okay?

560
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,266
I'm... I'm sorry, Mr. Milkovich.

561
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,560
I don't think this job's
the right fit for you.

562
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,688
What do you mean? I...

563
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,525
You know what?
Goddamn right, it's not.

564
00:20:17,566 --> 00:20:20,820
I don't need to be out here,
making minimum-ass wage,

565
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:22,321
tossing out perfectly good food,

566
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:23,590
getting blisters
all over my hands

567
00:20:23,614 --> 00:20:26,575
so I can clock out
with a bunch of fucking bozos,

568
00:20:26,617 --> 00:20:28,786
go home smelling
like a rotten fucking pig.

569
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,372
This is your fault
for making me do this shit.

570
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,040
Fuck you, and fuck you,

571
00:20:33,082 --> 00:20:35,334
and especially fuck you.

572
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,092
Shake that...

573
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,553
[Tipping] Ass for me,
shake that ass for me

574
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:46,679
Come on, girl

575
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,806
Shake that ass for me

576
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,391
Shake that ass for me

577
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,559
Come on, girl, shake

578
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,726
That ass for me

579
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,353
Shake that ass for me

580
00:20:54,395 --> 00:20:55,646
Okay, it's your part.

581
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,940
I'm a menace, a Dennis,
an oral hygienist

582
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:00,109
Open your mouth for about
four or five minutes

583
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,735
Take a little bit
of fluoride with it

584
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:03,320
Swish but don't spit it

585
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:04,530
Swallow and I'll finish

586
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,073
[dispatch] Attention,
all officers.

587
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:06,991
[quietly] Thank God.

588
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,677
Damn, we almost got through
the whole thing.

589
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:10,578
That song makes me feel
kind of badass.

590
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:12,872
- You too?
- Uh, sure.

591
00:21:12,913 --> 00:21:13,831
[dispatch] Attention,
all officers,

592
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,040
we have a 312 in progress.

593
00:21:15,082 --> 00:21:16,792
- 700 block of Riverside.
- Hell yeah.

594
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:17,978
[dispatch] Convenience store
robbery.

595
00:21:18,002 --> 00:21:19,628
Four suspects,
armed and dangerous.

596
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,523
Any and all officers
in the area, please respond.

597
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:22,715
It's go time.

598
00:21:22,756 --> 00:21:24,568
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cowboy.
What are you doing there?

599
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:26,176
Have you learned nothing today?

600
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,136
We're so close.

601
00:21:27,177 --> 00:21:29,263
No, no, no, there's officers
much closer than we are.

602
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:30,448
We're, like, two blocks away.

603
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,325
I've seen this before.
By the time we get there,

604
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:33,309
someone will have gotten shot,

605
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,744
and Homicide will take over
the case.

606
00:21:34,768 --> 00:21:36,896
So let's just stay
out of their crime scene.

607
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:38,647
But it's our duty
to take the call.

608
00:21:38,689 --> 00:21:40,691
Trust me on this one.
We're partners.

609
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,277
Need to stick together,
be a united front,

610
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,363
have each other's back. Okay?

611
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,531
Okay.

612
00:21:47,573 --> 00:21:49,450
[Tipping]
You'll thank me one day.

613
00:21:49,491 --> 00:21:50,618
Fucking bored shitless.

614
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:53,078
Now can we get back to our song?

615
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,414
Girl, shake that ass for me

616
00:21:55,456 --> 00:21:57,458
Shake that ass for me

617
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,294
All due respect, Veronica,

618
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,670
your brownies were awful.

619
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:02,838
Really?

620
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,382
Did you fry the marijuana
in butter first?

621
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,842
No, she didn't.

622
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,636
What difference does that make?

623
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,597
It's the difference
between a ghetto pot brownie

624
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:13,432
and a culinary delight.

625
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:14,642
By frying the weed,

626
00:22:14,683 --> 00:22:17,394
you activate the cannabinoids.

627
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,438
Reggae music playing

628
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,483
Here, stir this for me,
will you?

629
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:25,194
Also, the lipids in the butter

630
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:26,862
bond with the weed to form

631
00:22:26,904 --> 00:22:29,406
the perfect cannabis infusion.

632
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,783
Yeah, V.

633
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:35,245
Now, let's see
how our first batch looks.

634
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,706
Oh, yeah. [laughs]

635
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:39,458
[Kev] Oh, those smell amazing.

636
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,417
Eh?

637
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,670
Kev, my fine feathered friend,

638
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:44,755
I need you to cut
that pan of brownies

639
00:22:44,797 --> 00:22:46,840
into two-by-two squares.

640
00:22:46,882 --> 00:22:49,593
Each square has to be
equal size and shape.

641
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,387
I want ten perfect brownies.

642
00:22:51,428 --> 00:22:52,596
Aye-aye, captain.

643
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,015
That's $200 worth of heaven
right there.

644
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,475
$200?

645
00:22:56,517 --> 00:22:59,812
That's, like, a lot of money
for each brownie.

646
00:22:59,853 --> 00:23:01,230
20 bucks a brownie, Kev.

647
00:23:01,271 --> 00:23:01,939
Holy shit.

648
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,565
The going rate is ten, Frank.

649
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,067
Nobody's gonna dish out 20.

650
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:07,236
That's because no one has tasted

651
00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:09,571
Frank Gallagher's masterpiece

652
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:11,740
of psychedelic goodness yet.

653
00:23:11,782 --> 00:23:15,160
I'll speak the truth
even if you never understand

654
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:25,129
rock music

655
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,507
Hey, Kendall.
What can I do you for?

656
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,759
Back up. Keep your distance.

657
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:31,885
What's up?

658
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,513
Can't eat this crap
the lunch lady gave me.

659
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,518
How much for
a peanut butter sandwich, Liam?

660
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,854
Donations only.
Whatever you got.

661
00:23:45,607 --> 00:23:47,526
Um...

662
00:23:47,568 --> 00:23:49,820
stole this Red Bull
from the corner store.

663
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,572
That'll work.

664
00:23:51,613 --> 00:23:54,366
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

665
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:56,535
This is not an open-air market.

666
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:58,871
It is a liability
for you to sell food

667
00:23:58,912 --> 00:23:59,830
on school property.

668
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:00,873
That's mine.

669
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:02,541
I'm not selling it. Donating it.

670
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:04,501
Well, you can't do that, either.

671
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:05,544
What, share my lunch?

672
00:24:05,586 --> 00:24:06,670
No.

673
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,422
So it's okay
for these underprivileged kids

674
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:09,691
to starve
because they don't want

675
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:12,092
to eat the slop you give them?

676
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,927
Until they pay their lunch debt,

677
00:24:13,969 --> 00:24:15,345
that's all they get.

678
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,432
Now close it down.

679
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:19,475
Sorry, everyone.

680
00:24:19,516 --> 00:24:22,061
Loraine won't let me donate
sandwiches to you anymore.

681
00:24:22,102 --> 00:24:25,397
- [student] That sucks!
- [students booing]

682
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:26,565
I know, I know.

683
00:24:26,607 --> 00:24:28,442
It hurts me just as much
as it hurts you.

684
00:24:28,484 --> 00:24:29,902
I didn't grow up
with money, either,

685
00:24:29,943 --> 00:24:31,820
but ever since
I was a little kid,

686
00:24:31,862 --> 00:24:33,864
it's been my passion
to give to those

687
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,074
less fortunate than myself.

688
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:36,676
- [child ] Yeah!
- [child] You're the man, Liam.

689
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,785
Please.

690
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:39,161
If I had extra money,

691
00:24:39,203 --> 00:24:40,871
I'd give it
to all my friends here

692
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,331
so they could buy hot lunch,

693
00:24:42,372 --> 00:24:43,165
but since I don't,

694
00:24:43,207 --> 00:24:45,542
I thought the next best thing
would be

695
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,753
is to donate food
from my family's kitchen.

696
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:49,630
- [crowd cheering]
- [student] Yeah, Liam!

697
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,090
Please, please, please.

698
00:24:51,131 --> 00:24:52,966
I'm just one man
trying to make a difference.

699
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,677
I won't take up
any more of your time.

700
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,268
- [students cheer]
- [student] Bye, Loraine.

701
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,938
[student] Go, Liam.

702
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,315
Now, who wants a sandwich?

703
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:13,362
This one is when the twins
dressed like salt and pepper

704
00:25:13,403 --> 00:25:14,571
for Halloween.

705
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,782
The condiments,
not the hip-hop group.

706
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,700
You do realize people
just keep photos

707
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:20,220
- on their phone now, right?
- [stomach rumbles]

708
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:23,872
Ooh, I got some rumbles
in my tumbles.

709
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,582
You hungry?

710
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,750
For police action.

711
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,544
What about for eggplant pea?

712
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,087
Best this side of Milwaukee.

713
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,047
- I guess.
- Let's do this.

714
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:33,549
[clears throat] Dispatch,

715
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,509
this is Officers Tipping
and Gallagher.

716
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:37,010
[dispatch] Go for dispatch.

717
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:39,638
A concerned citizen
just stopped us...

718
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,032
What are you talking about?
We've been at...

719
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:42,683
...and reported
a suspicious person

720
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:44,309
over on Hemlock Street.

721
00:25:44,351 --> 00:25:45,811
We're gonna investigate.

722
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:47,062
[dispatch] Copy that.

723
00:25:47,104 --> 00:25:49,314
Report back your findings
and if you need backup.

724
00:25:49,356 --> 00:25:50,524
Will do.

725
00:25:50,566 --> 00:25:51,859
What the hell
was that all about?

726
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,443
Buys us more time for lunch.

727
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,113
Eggplant pea, here we come.

728
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,739
So let me get this straight.

729
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,117
We don't respond
to real crimes in progress,

730
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,869
but we do respond to fake crimes

731
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,036
that aren't even happening?

732
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:04,580
You're getting the hang of this.

733
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:06,415
This is so
not what I signed up for.

734
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:09,209
Your tum-tum will thank me.

735
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:18,719
[Mickey] Right on time.

736
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,680
Rock music

737
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,313
Nice truck, fatty.

738
00:26:41,658 --> 00:26:44,036
Ding Dongs for a ding-dong.

739
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,542
Ugh, smelly fucking fat-ass.

740
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:51,585
I'm gonna get pinkeye

741
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:53,795
from all the farts
in this thing.

742
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:58,300
- [engine turns over]
- Ugh.

743
00:26:58,342 --> 00:27:00,677
Jack-fucking-pot.

744
00:27:00,719 --> 00:27:02,221
Later, Jabba the Hutt!

745
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:05,432
[truck driver] Hey. Hey, hey!

746
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:07,809
Hey, get the door for me,
would you, Val Kilmer?

747
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:09,186
[yelps]

748
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:14,566
Asshole!

749
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,200
Did you and Tommy
get in a fight about something?

750
00:27:23,242 --> 00:27:25,869
- Just drop it.
- Oh.

751
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,287
He owe you money?

752
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,998
Has for years,
but that's not it.

753
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,626
What, did you wreck his car?

754
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,046
I wish it were something
so simple.

755
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:39,424
[knocking at door]

756
00:27:45,514 --> 00:27:47,266
- Yeah?
- Hi.

757
00:27:47,307 --> 00:27:49,184
We heard
you're selling edibles here,

758
00:27:49,226 --> 00:27:51,061
and we were told to ask

759
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,772
for the marijuana magician.

760
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,901
Come on in! He's right here.

761
00:27:57,943 --> 00:27:59,736
I'll show you to him.

762
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,737
Didn't catch your names.

763
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,447
Barry, and he's Ryan.

764
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:04,533
Sure.

765
00:28:04,574 --> 00:28:07,119
The one and only Frank.

766
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,328
Have a seat, gentlemen.

767
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,580
How can the Frank
help you today?

768
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,791
Selection looks impressive.

769
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,168
So what do you have here?

770
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,087
[Frank] I've arranged
my products

771
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,548
in descending order of THC.

772
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:21,800
Starting here at the top tier,

773
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:24,886
I call this "Can't-Get-Off-
The-Couch Cookie."

774
00:28:24,928 --> 00:28:26,805
- [Barry] Yowza.
- I don't want that.

775
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:28,116
I still need to do work
every day.

776
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,684
Uh, you and me both, brother.

777
00:28:30,726 --> 00:28:31,810
Continuing down the line,

778
00:28:31,852 --> 00:28:33,937
we reduce the THC until we get

779
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,522
to the bottom shelf

780
00:28:35,564 --> 00:28:36,940
and our homemade suckers,

781
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:39,067
which are basically all CBD.

782
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:41,862
What do you think is best
to give me a buzz

783
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,323
but also help my sciatica?

784
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,743
I would stick somewhere here
in the middle.

785
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,786
These chocolate walnut brownies

786
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,872
have the perfect amount of THC

787
00:28:51,913 --> 00:28:53,749
to give you a little euphoria,

788
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,000
and the CBD

789
00:28:55,042 --> 00:28:57,002
to relieve that pain
in your ass.

790
00:28:57,044 --> 00:28:58,545
Should we get two?

791
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:01,173
We're going to that foam party
this weekend.

792
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:02,841
Let's make it four, then.

793
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,801
[Frank] Four it is.
If you would pay

794
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,970
my sales clerks behind the bar,

795
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,348
I will bag these up for you.

796
00:29:12,642 --> 00:29:13,810
[Kev] Excellent, gentlemen.

797
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,188
Four brownies. So that's, uh...

798
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:18,148
[Veronica] $80.

799
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,484
Well, this is fucking vile.

800
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,401
Morning, Lip.

801
00:29:21,443 --> 00:29:24,112
Hey, Marsha.
How's Georgia doing?

802
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:26,531
Got into a bowl
of butterscotch candy

803
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:27,908
I have out for guests.

804
00:29:27,949 --> 00:29:29,993
Didn't you?
Ate the wrappers and all.

805
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:31,078
That right?

806
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,081
I'll be picking up
poopy candy bits for days.

807
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,166
Hey, uh, you didn't see

808
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,751
who did any of this, did you?

809
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:39,211
What?

810
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:41,004
Oh, broke my front window,

811
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,565
you know, put all this trash
in the yard.

812
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:44,716
I thought the house
was always like this.

813
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:45,818
Yeah, when Mr. Shaw lives here,

814
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:47,070
but I've been trying
to fix it up.

815
00:29:47,094 --> 00:29:48,512
You buy the place?

816
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:49,554
No, just renting.

817
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:52,224
Spending a lot of money
if it's not yours.

818
00:29:52,265 --> 00:29:53,826
Yeah, well, I want
some nice things in my life

819
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,060
for a change.

820
00:29:55,102 --> 00:29:57,187
Well, good for you.

821
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,730
- Thank you.
- [Fred] Da-da.

822
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:00,857
[laughs]

823
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,859
Hey, Marsha.

824
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,670
You see any punk-ass kids
running around here,

825
00:30:04,694 --> 00:30:05,779
you let me know?

826
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:07,447
You got it, Lip.

827
00:30:07,489 --> 00:30:09,282
Thanks.

828
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,708
Thanks, Ma.

829
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,502
Of course, sweetie.

830
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:22,587
Oh, that's Arthur

831
00:30:22,629 --> 00:30:25,465
on his honeymoon
with his first wife, Nadine.

832
00:30:25,507 --> 00:30:28,677
Oh, you people sure are
into hard copy photos, huh?

833
00:30:28,718 --> 00:30:31,221
[laughs] I loved Nadine.

834
00:30:31,263 --> 00:30:32,931
I really do miss her.

835
00:30:32,973 --> 00:30:34,266
[Tipping] Ma, she cheated on me,

836
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:36,435
with five different
police officers... five.

837
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:39,146
Well, she certainly had a type.

838
00:30:39,187 --> 00:30:40,522
You gotta give her that.

839
00:30:40,564 --> 00:30:43,316
Oh, Carl, can I give you
another serving?

840
00:30:43,358 --> 00:30:45,152
Oh, no, Mrs. Tipping, I...

841
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,404
Oh, Rhoda.

842
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:49,531
You're part of the family now.

843
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:52,325
Okay.
Uh, no thank you, uh, Rhoda.

844
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,952
I'm not too big
on heavy lunches.

845
00:30:53,994 --> 00:30:55,829
Besides, we gotta get
back out to the streets.

846
00:30:55,871 --> 00:30:57,265
Oh, right, right, right,
right, right.

847
00:30:57,289 --> 00:30:59,291
Thanks for reminding me.
[clears throat]

848
00:30:59,332 --> 00:31:00,459
Dispatch, come in, please.

849
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,002
[dispatch] You've got dispatch.

850
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:03,962
This is Officer Tipping.
Officer Gallagher and I

851
00:31:04,004 --> 00:31:05,213
have located the suspect,

852
00:31:05,255 --> 00:31:07,007
and we are now proceeding
with questioning.

853
00:31:07,048 --> 00:31:09,885
[dispatch] Copy that.

854
00:31:09,926 --> 00:31:14,139
I am so proud of you, Arty.

855
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:15,557
- Oh, both of you.
- Mm.

856
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,809
[chuckles]

857
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,645
Mm.

858
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:22,939
Family.

859
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,274
[Rhoda] Goodbye, boys.

860
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,234
You know what I like to do
after a big meal?

861
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:27,652
Oh, I don't know. Do your job?

862
00:31:27,694 --> 00:31:28,487
Catch some rapists?

863
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:30,363
Take a nap over at the Best Buy.

864
00:31:30,405 --> 00:31:31,865
Have you ever sat in one

865
00:31:31,907 --> 00:31:33,742
of the massage recliners
they have there?

866
00:31:33,783 --> 00:31:35,368
No, but I'm sure I will now.

867
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,414
My lower lumbar
could really use some kneading.

868
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:42,292
Dispatch, the suspect
has directed us

869
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,127
to an abandoned house

870
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:46,505
that has a suspicious smell
emanating from it.

871
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:49,382
Officer Gallagher and I
will investigate further.

872
00:31:49,424 --> 00:31:51,384
[dispatch] Copy that.

873
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:02,938
[Debbie] Hey, it's starting
to look

874
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:04,356
like a magic castle in here.

875
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:07,234
[Tami] Or like a Care Bear
took a giant shit.

876
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:10,111
Or Strawberry Shortcake
fucked My Little Pony.

877
00:32:10,153 --> 00:32:11,571
Yeah, or Glinda the Good Witch

878
00:32:11,613 --> 00:32:12,948
just, like, projectile vomited...

879
00:32:12,989 --> 00:32:14,616
Okay, I get it.
Stop making fun of me.

880
00:32:14,658 --> 00:32:16,785
This is gonna be
the best party ever.

881
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:18,286
Yeah, for you.

882
00:32:18,328 --> 00:32:20,705
What do you mean?
It's Franny's birthday.

883
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:21,665
[helium whooshing]

884
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,084
You just seem
a little more into it

885
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:25,460
than Franny does, babe.

886
00:32:25,502 --> 00:32:28,421
That is so not true.
Franny's so into it.

887
00:32:28,463 --> 00:32:30,757
I mean, what little girl
doesn't want a princess party?

888
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,342
I never wanted one.

889
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:34,010
Me neither.

890
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:35,971
I did.

891
00:32:36,012 --> 00:32:38,098
Well, that explains it.

892
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:39,516
Explains what?

893
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,018
Why you're so obsessed
with all this shit.

894
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,354
I am not obsessed.

895
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,731
The magic wands don't go there.
On the coffee table.

896
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:48,191
Oh, okay. Sorry.

897
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,193
I just... I never got
the princess manual.

898
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,445
I was always into G.I. Joes
and shit when I was a kid,

899
00:32:52,487 --> 00:32:54,364
so that's the kind of parties
I had.

900
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:55,758
Yeah, well, every birthday,
one of my uncles

901
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:58,785
would just get me drunk
and let me shoot his gun.

902
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:01,454
The bounce house is here!

903
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:02,872
- Yes!
- Hell yeah!

904
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:03,623
Love a bounce house.

905
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,292
- Whoo!
- I've never been in one.

906
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,543
What?

907
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,378
Uh, none of the adults
were sober enough

908
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,213
to make me a cake, never mind

909
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:11,673
get a bounce house.

910
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:14,301
You were seriously
raised by wolves.

911
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:17,053
[generator whirring]

912
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:19,306
It's supposed to be
a princess castle.

913
00:33:19,347 --> 00:33:20,890
You sure?

914
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,267
Paperwork says Dracula's Lair.

915
00:33:22,309 --> 00:33:24,019
Oh, she's sure.

916
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,604
Now why would I order
Dracula's Lair

917
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:28,648
for a five-year-old girl's
birthday party?

918
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:31,151
I love it!

919
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,279
I need a princess castle.
Get me a princess castle.

920
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:35,339
Sorry, ma'am, we don't have

921
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:38,783
anything extra on the truck.

922
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:39,701
[scoffs]

923
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,620
Well, this is
the worst thing ever.

924
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:44,414
I think it's kind of cool.
Come on!

925
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:47,208
It says "Bounce-ilvania," Debs.

926
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,544
What could be more fun
than that?

927
00:33:49,586 --> 00:33:52,797
Rock music

928
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,927
Okay, all bets in?

929
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,512
Shit.

930
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,431
I got nothing. Pair of tens.

931
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,189
Full house.
Sorry about that, boys.

932
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,148
Crap.

933
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,459
How is it
the new kid always wins?

934
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:12,942
Beginner's luck.

935
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,694
Uh, yeah.

936
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,529
- Franklin Pierce...
- Loitering...

937
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:18,406
- James Buchanan...
- Littering.

938
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:20,009
- [Tipping] Abraham Lincoln.
- [Carl] Actual B&E.

939
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:21,242
[Tipping] Andrew Johnson.

940
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:22,118
Defacing property.

941
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,453
Ulysses S. Grant.

942
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,664
Ah, shoot, I can't remember
who was next.

943
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:27,791
- Who's the 19th president?
- I don't know.

944
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,668
I didn't even know
there was 19 presidents.

945
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:32,212
- Pfft.
- Ah, more loitering.

946
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:35,507
Battery.

947
00:34:35,548 --> 00:34:36,675
Oh, my God, what is that?

948
00:34:36,716 --> 00:34:38,426
What? Where? What is it?

949
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:39,904
- Go time, is what it is.
- [siren wailing]

950
00:34:39,928 --> 00:34:41,304
This car has a siren?

951
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,305
Let's move it, people!

952
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:43,431
And a megaphone?

953
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:45,975
[Tipping] Hang on, partner.

954
00:34:48,144 --> 00:34:49,979
This is what I'm talking about!

955
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:51,356
[tires screech]

956
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:52,440
Go.

957
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,111
Put these on.

958
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,254
What's going on?
What's happening?

959
00:34:57,278 --> 00:34:59,406
- Where are we going?
- Traffic light is out.

960
00:34:59,447 --> 00:35:01,282
Good thing
we were in the vicinity.

961
00:35:01,324 --> 00:35:03,076
You stand on that side.
I'll stay here.

962
00:35:03,118 --> 00:35:04,285
[car horns honking]

963
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:14,838
- [driver honks horn]
- Out of the road, asshole!

964
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:20,593
Watch your star all by yourself

965
00:35:20,635 --> 00:35:24,514
Fame, but I don't die

966
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:27,767
All I want

967
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:31,604
I won't be here, you're all...

968
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,986
Yo, what up, Jose?

969
00:35:38,027 --> 00:35:39,654
Looking good, man.

970
00:35:39,696 --> 00:35:41,656
Yeah, you too.
I'm not used to seeing

971
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:43,700
your cracker ass
on this side of the wire.

972
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:45,535
So what's this deal
you got for me?

973
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,162
Right here.

974
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:48,413
A dumpster?

975
00:35:48,455 --> 00:35:49,724
Man, what kind of idiot
you think I am?

976
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:52,751
No, no, ain't like that.
Look, check it out.

977
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,627
Boom!

978
00:35:58,131 --> 00:35:59,048
Damn.

979
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,049
[Mickey] Uh-huh. I told you.

980
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:01,634
[Jose] Wait, what is all this?

981
00:36:01,676 --> 00:36:03,261
It's food.
The fuck you think it is?

982
00:36:03,303 --> 00:36:04,596
No, I mean,
where did you get it?

983
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,640
Difference does that make?
I got it, didn't I?

984
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:09,309
I could really use
some of this shit.

985
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:10,351
Uh-huh.

986
00:36:10,393 --> 00:36:13,229
Pasta, oatmeal...

987
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,398
flour.

988
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,858
How much you want?

989
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,820
Hey, for you,
give you a good price.

990
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:24,699
Wait a minute. This is expired.

991
00:36:24,741 --> 00:36:26,826
- So what?
- It says 2019.

992
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,787
It's fucking pasta, man.
Doesn't go bad.

993
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:30,538
Yeah, well, I hate the guys
in this joint

994
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,266
just as much as anybody,
but I'm not trying to give them

995
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,458
salmonella or some shit.

996
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,877
Will you quit being a bitch?
Those dates don't mean shit,

997
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,253
and you know it.

998
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,422
You... you're a fucking asshole.

999
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:41,341
Hey, a'ight, man. Whatever.

1000
00:36:41,382 --> 00:36:43,092
No problem.

1001
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,677
All good.

1002
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:45,946
Got plenty other cooks out there

1003
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,556
willing to take this off
my hands for...

1004
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:51,726
oh, half what they usually pay
for their bulk items.

1005
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:53,436
Charge their boss
the same amount,

1006
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:56,356
and guess what?
They just pocket the rest.

1007
00:36:56,397 --> 00:36:59,400
Peppy music

1008
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,445
Uh-huh. You interested now.

1009
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,825
[laughs]

1010
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,036
Ah, there you go.

1011
00:37:10,078 --> 00:37:11,579
Hmm.

1012
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:13,039
All right.

1013
00:37:13,081 --> 00:37:14,541
There you go, Framingham.

1014
00:37:14,582 --> 00:37:16,459
Oh, gee, thanks.

1015
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:18,670
Pretty boy.

1016
00:37:19,587 --> 00:37:21,339
Thanks.

1017
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:24,050
Hey, uh, you want to get
a couple of drinks,

1018
00:37:24,092 --> 00:37:25,218
piss away our paychecks?

1019
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,053
Ah, not tonight. Thank you.

1020
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:28,304
All right, suit yourself.

1021
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,056
Yeah.

1022
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:38,231
Hey, George. Hey, wait up.

1023
00:37:38,273 --> 00:37:40,608
What's going on?

1024
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,695
Who do I talk to about
a mistake with my paycheck?

1025
00:37:43,736 --> 00:37:45,363
Oh, let me see this.

1026
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:46,489
What's the mistake?

1027
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:48,050
Look at here.
It says I worked 39 hours.

1028
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:50,076
I worked 45.
I should be getting overtime.

1029
00:37:50,118 --> 00:37:51,971
Yeah, that's what they do.
They dock you for lunch,

1030
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:53,621
the time it takes
to go to the head,

1031
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:56,124
anything to keep it
under 40 hours.

1032
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:57,083
- You serious?
- Yeah.

1033
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,936
That way, they don't have
to give you benefits.

1034
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,254
- They get away with that?
- They do.

1035
00:38:02,797 --> 00:38:05,508
Oh, even at 39 hours,
the money's not adding up.

1036
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,802
Ah, dude, they take out
all kinds of crap.

1037
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:09,846
Locker fees, safety vests,
you name it.

1038
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:11,031
It's usually about four months

1039
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,765
before you're even getting
a full paycheck.

1040
00:38:12,807 --> 00:38:16,227
Welcome to a working man's
America, Kemosabe.

1041
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,366
Yo, Gallagher,
how'd it go today?

1042
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,743
Damn, what happened to you?

1043
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:33,369
Broke his cop cherry.

1044
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:35,830
Best day of my life.
Kicked so much ass.

1045
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:37,457
- Jesus.
- Senior officers

1046
00:38:37,498 --> 00:38:39,584
are taking us to the cop bar
across the street.

1047
00:38:39,626 --> 00:38:42,170
Celebrate you tadpoles
becoming real women.

1048
00:38:42,211 --> 00:38:43,796
Hell yeah. I'm in.

1049
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,381
Hey, you not coming?

1050
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:46,549
Gotta see the fam.

1051
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:48,402
Yeah, don't even bother
with Lady Arthur over there.

1052
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:49,761
He's allergic to fun.

1053
00:38:49,802 --> 00:38:51,220
Hurry up and get changed,
Gallagher.

1054
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,263
Meet us over there.

1055
00:38:52,305 --> 00:38:53,723
I suggest you get
some rest, Carl.

1056
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:55,683
Hey, why would I get some rest?

1057
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:57,810
We didn't do shit today.
All we did was rest.

1058
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,246
I wanted to have
an action-packed day

1059
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,313
like Yanez did,

1060
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:01,689
not sing along to Eminem.

1061
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,983
A security guard would've had
more fun than we did.

1062
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:05,693
But I put up with it. Know why?

1063
00:39:05,735 --> 00:39:07,588
Because you said we gotta have
each other's backs,

1064
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:10,114
be a united front.
I was bored shitless today.

1065
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,159
I don't care, 'cause I wanna be
the best partner that I can be.

1066
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:16,120
So the least you can do
is walk across that street

1067
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:18,998
and buy me a damn drink.

1068
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,626
All right, partner. One drink.

1069
00:39:21,668 --> 00:39:23,795
Rock music

1070
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:27,382
[all chanting "Chug"]

1071
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:35,306
[cheers and applause]

1072
00:39:35,348 --> 00:39:37,266
Damn.

1073
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,726
Your partner seems pretty wild.

1074
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,770
Yeah, first I've seen that.

1075
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,605
Oh, shit. I think he's married.

1076
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,274
Oh, that's okay.
Tina doesn't care.

1077
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,402
So first day, huh?

1078
00:39:47,443 --> 00:39:48,820
Yeah. What do you do?

1079
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,488
I'm over at the leather factory.

1080
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,448
Mm. Like coats and stuff?

1081
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:53,741
No, not as glamorous.

1082
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:55,868
We make bullet bags
and rifle slings.

1083
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,745
It sucks. I stink like cow shit

1084
00:39:57,787 --> 00:40:00,289
and chemicals all the time.
Smell me.

1085
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,874
Uh, well...

1086
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:04,419
Yeah, smell...
Smells great to me.

1087
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,837
Aw, you're sweet.

1088
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:07,588
If I'm still at the factory
in five years,

1089
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,215
I give you permission
to shoot me.

1090
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:10,550
[laughs] Okay.

1091
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:12,176
No, seriously.

1092
00:40:12,218 --> 00:40:15,763
Take that big old gun of yours
and shoot me.

1093
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:18,433
And what would you rather
be doing instead?

1094
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:20,143
Mm, marry a cop,

1095
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:21,811
be his wife,

1096
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,563
have a bunch of his kids.

1097
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:24,647
Uh...

1098
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,816
Don't worry, bunny.
We're just having fun.

1099
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:28,776
So why'd you want to be po-po?

1100
00:40:28,818 --> 00:40:30,778
Um, you know, make a difference,

1101
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,779
do something for the community,

1102
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:33,448
be a part of the solution.

1103
00:40:33,489 --> 00:40:34,883
- Uh, when I was a kid...
- Wanna fuck?

1104
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,201
- Wait, what?
- Come on.

1105
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:38,786
Okay.

1106
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:40,455
Oh, leave it.
We'll be right back.

1107
00:40:40,496 --> 00:40:41,456
Your place close?

1108
00:40:41,497 --> 00:40:42,599
Yeah, but we're not going there.

1109
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:44,250
Me and my ex
still live together.

1110
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,044
Randy, guard our drinks.

1111
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:48,755
Let's go.

1112
00:40:48,796 --> 00:40:50,298
Where are you guys going?

1113
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:51,799
Bathroom. Come with?

1114
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:53,259
- Want to?
- No.

1115
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:55,595
Yes. Absolutely.

1116
00:40:57,889 --> 00:41:00,433
I can't believe we sold
all that product in one day.

1117
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:01,976
Ye of little faith.

1118
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:04,437
No one even flinched
at the high prices.

1119
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:07,482
Guys, weed is in my blood,

1120
00:41:07,523 --> 00:41:09,025
literally and figuratively.

1121
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,652
I know the business
inside and out.

1122
00:41:11,694 --> 00:41:12,987
Guess you were right, Frank.

1123
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:14,822
I don't hear that often enough.

1124
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:18,409
We made $3,400.

1125
00:41:18,451 --> 00:41:19,678
- What?
- [Frank] Course we did.

1126
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:23,664
Mm, mm, mm,
that's $1,133 apiece.

1127
00:41:23,706 --> 00:41:24,874
Take your pile.

1128
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:27,710
Oh, it's been lovely
doing business with you.

1129
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,504
Shall we do it again tomorrow?

1130
00:41:29,545 --> 00:41:31,005
I don't see why not. V?

1131
00:41:31,047 --> 00:41:34,467
Until our suppliers
are back up and running, sure.

1132
00:41:34,509 --> 00:41:35,551
Excellent.

1133
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:39,430
I shall see you
bright and early...

1134
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:41,307
and by that, I mean noon.

1135
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:42,016
[laughter]

1136
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:44,435
And I liked helping you out
today

1137
00:41:44,477 --> 00:41:46,020
with your emergency,

1138
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,772
but the trial run is over.

1139
00:41:47,814 --> 00:41:49,649
From this point going forward,

1140
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,110
the cut will be 60/40.
I'm the 60.

1141
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:54,112
- Seems fair to me.
- No way.

1142
00:41:54,153 --> 00:41:57,532
I got the raw materials.
I did the manufacturing.

1143
00:41:57,573 --> 00:42:00,284
You were simply the retail.

1144
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,120
Toodle-oo.

1145
00:42:06,165 --> 00:42:08,709
And whatever you guys
are going through,

1146
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,420
you gotta kiss and make up.

1147
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:14,423

1149
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:18,386
[Tipping] Oh, God! Oh, God!

1150
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:19,470
[Tina] Feel good, baby?

1151
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,472
[Tipping] I feel... yes,
baby feels very good.

1152
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:25,017
[Tipping grunting]

1153
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,829
Hey, can you guys keep it down
in there, please?

1154
00:42:26,853 --> 00:42:28,604
[Tipping] Yeah, yeah, sure, bud.

1155

[moaning]

1156
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:32,191
My... my legs
are kind of getting wobbly.

1157
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:33,818
If you put one foot
up on the toilet,

1158
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,069
it usually works better.

1159
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:37,780
[Tipping] Oh, wow,
what are you doing to me?

1160
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,007
[Tina] Want me to stop, Arthur?

1161
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,908
[Tipping] No, no, no.

1162
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,660
There you go.
That's better, right?

1163
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:44,287
I guess.
I'm a little distracted,

1164
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:45,246
but I'm fine.

1165
00:42:45,288 --> 00:42:47,331
You get used
to these close quarters.

1166
00:42:47,373 --> 00:42:49,876
- You've done this before?
- Yeah, dozens of times.

1167
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:50,877
Oh.

1168
00:42:50,918 --> 00:42:52,503
[Tipping]
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.

1169
00:42:52,545 --> 00:42:53,754
Okay, I gotta stop. I'm sorry.

1170
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:55,131
This is getting a little weird.

1171
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:58,176
- [Tipping groans]
- Really?

1172
00:42:58,217 --> 00:42:59,319
- [heavy thud]
- [Tina screams]

1173
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,846
What the hell?
What's going on in there?

1174
00:43:01,888 --> 00:43:03,347
I think he's dead.

1175
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:06,350
My vagina killed him.

1176
00:43:06,392 --> 00:43:07,685
Whoa.

1177
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:10,980
Fuck, Arthur.

[cell phone chimes]

1179
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:14,192
[sighs] Shit.

1180
00:43:14,233 --> 00:43:17,153
Another mom said her kid
can't come to the party.

1181
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:21,616
It might have something to do
with your ankle bracelet, babe.

1182
00:43:21,657 --> 00:43:23,117
Well, whatever. That's too bad.

1183
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,553
We don't need
Franny's school friends.

1184
00:43:24,577 --> 00:43:25,786
We'll still have fun.

1185
00:43:25,828 --> 00:43:27,914
Okay, everybody grab
your song lyrics.

1186
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:30,625
It's time to sing
the princess song.

1187
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:32,793
Kay, Franny.

1188
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:35,671
Sit right here. Kay.

1189
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,425
Okay.

1190
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:42,011
One, two, three.

I want to be a princess

1192

You can be a princess

1193
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,644
We can all be princesses

1194
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:51,771
In a fairy tale

1195
00:43:51,812 --> 00:43:54,190

00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:04,116
Ho, ho, ho!
Happy birthday, Franny.

1200
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:06,661
Look what I bought you.
These are from me, okay?

1201
00:44:06,702 --> 00:44:08,162
Only me, your favorite uncle.

1202
00:44:08,204 --> 00:44:10,289
- Yay, guns!
- Guns!

1203
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,875
[Debbie] That is not
a princess gift.

1204
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,877
- Tough titties.
- Let's play!

- Sorry, Debs.

kid. Come on.

- [Mickey] Go ahead.

you're dead! I shot you!

I'm really sorry again, sir,
that you had a heart attack.

You know,
I somehow feel responsible.

Maybe you shouldn't had
all those pitchers of beer.

Well, back at it again
in the morning, right, sir?

00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,748
Why?

1242
00:45:33,789 --> 00:45:35,875
You're making your house
look too good.

1243
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,084
So?

1244
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:39,045
Our property tax will go up.

1245
00:45:39,086 --> 00:45:41,047
What, because we planted
a couple flowers?

1246
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:43,632
And put in new windows
and mulch,

1247
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:44,884
cleaned up the trash.

1248
00:45:44,925 --> 00:45:47,303
People are gonna wanna do
the same as you.

1249
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,347
White folk will drive
around the city

1250
00:45:49,388 --> 00:45:51,349
looking for a new place to live,

1251
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,976
never imagine themselves
down here.

1252
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:57,563
Then they see your house,
call the realtors.

1253
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:59,440
Rent will go up.

1254
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:01,025
Property tax.

1255
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:02,943
We've been here our whole lives,

1256
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:05,237
and now we're being pushed out.

1257
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:07,031
Where will we go then?

1258
00:46:07,073 --> 00:46:10,785
[siren wailing faintly]

1259
00:46:10,826 --> 00:46:14,205
[sighs]

1260
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:17,666
Franny did not like her party.

1261
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,211
Yeah, not so much.

1262
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:24,799
You were right. I mean...

1263
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,093
I only did this for myself.

1264
00:46:27,134 --> 00:46:30,096
I just... I always dreamed
of having a princess party

1265
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:32,473
as a kid.

1266
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,600
I'm sorry, babes.

1267
00:46:42,108 --> 00:46:45,986
Not that I would do it
differently or anything.

1268
00:46:46,028 --> 00:46:47,363
Really?

1269
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,573
I mean, fuck no. It's like,

1270
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:50,991
Franny's only five.

1271
00:46:51,033 --> 00:46:52,219
It's not like
she's gonna remember

1272
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:53,536
any of this shit.

1273
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,705
Even if she does,
a little bit of disappointment

1274
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,499
is good for her.

1275
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:02,086
I mean, I would do anything
for that kid, but...

1276
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:04,296
sometimes I just...

1277
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:06,715
it's gotta be about me.

1278
00:47:10,886 --> 00:47:13,305
[chuckles]

1279
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:19,270
[siren wailing]

1280
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:21,439
Wow, it gets sketchy here
at night.

1281
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,983
Yeah, we should probably
go home.

1282
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:25,192
She's down there. Come on.

1283
00:47:25,234 --> 00:47:27,069
- You sure about this?
- Fuck Frank.

1284
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:28,946
Why should we give him
2/3 of our money?

1285
00:47:28,988 --> 00:47:30,030
'Cause he's our partner.

1286
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:31,425
[Veronica]
We can do everything he did.

1287
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,118
[Kev] I'm not sure I can make
those pineapple lollipops.

1288
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,786
Go, ask.

1289
00:47:35,828 --> 00:47:37,329
[sighs]

1290
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:39,915
Hey, um, how you doing?

1291
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:42,793
We're looking
to, um, buy some weed...

1292
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:45,212
Ganja, smoke, marijuana.

1293
00:47:45,254 --> 00:47:46,839
- [Veronica] Kev...
- I know you?

1294
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,257
- [Kev] No.
- Yeah, you do.

1295
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:49,550
Our friend was here earlier.

1296
00:47:49,592 --> 00:47:52,761
I should say our partner.
Frank Gallagher?

1297
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:54,597
Sorry, I don't got nothing.

1298
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,223
What, seriously?

1299
00:47:56,265 --> 00:47:57,933
You know anyone else
who's selling?

1300
00:47:57,975 --> 00:47:59,226
Nope.

1301
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:00,436
Come on, how's that possible?

1302
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:02,855
That's because I bought it all
from her...

1303
00:48:02,897 --> 00:48:04,273
dramatic music

1304
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:07,693
...with my earnings from today.

1305
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:08,903
[laughs]

1306
00:48:08,944 --> 00:48:10,321
- Hey, Frank!
- Hey.

1307
00:48:10,362 --> 00:48:13,741
I wanted to get a jump start
on tomorrow's work.

1308
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:15,367
Little did I know my partners

1309
00:48:15,409 --> 00:48:18,329
would be going behind my back.

1310
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:22,208
Just for the record,
I was hesitant about this.

1311
00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:24,001
I think from now on,

1312
00:48:24,043 --> 00:48:26,629
our cut's gonna be 70/30.

1313
00:48:29,798 --> 00:48:31,091
I'm the 70.

1314
00:48:36,931 --> 00:48:40,100
[Ian exhales heavily]

1315
00:48:40,142 --> 00:48:42,269
Guess the interview
didn't go so good?

1316
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:45,064
Nah. I don't do normal.

1317
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:46,524
It's boring as fuck, man.

1318
00:48:46,565 --> 00:48:49,026
I don't want to end up
a monkey like you anyway.

1319
00:48:49,068 --> 00:48:50,903
Just trying to be
a mature adult.

1320
00:48:50,945 --> 00:48:52,071
That's all.

1321
00:48:52,112 --> 00:48:53,155
Well...

1322
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:56,450
I, uh, like doing things my way.

1323
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,702
So we gonna fuck, or what?

1324
00:48:58,744 --> 00:49:00,079
Nope.

1325
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,164
You didn't get a real job.

1326
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,917
Fine by me, man. See if I care.

1327
00:49:04,959 --> 00:49:06,460
In fact,

1328
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:10,089
I might just jerk off
with all my money.

1329
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,591
Yeah. Come here, guys.

1330
00:49:12,633 --> 00:49:14,301
Mm...

1331
00:49:14,343 --> 00:49:17,888
Mm, mm, yeah.

1332
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,640
Ooh, yeah, come here.

1333
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:22,685
Suck that dick,
Benjamin Franklin.

1334
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,144
Come on now.

1335
00:49:24,186 --> 00:49:27,106
Got a little three-way with...
Whoever the fuck that is.

1336
00:49:27,147 --> 00:49:30,067
Mm, mm. Yeah, you like that?

1337
00:49:30,109 --> 00:49:32,319
What if we, uh, add...

1338
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:33,946
Hey, fuck off,
George Washington,

1339
00:49:33,988 --> 00:49:36,782
cheap-ass motherfucker.

1340
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:39,660
Rock music

1341
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,870
Oh, I like that.

1342
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,747
Uh-huh, keep going.

1343
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:47,585
God, money really does
buy happiness, huh?

1344
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:51,505
Lying in my coffin instead

1345
00:49:51,547 --> 00:49:55,217
The way I feel,
I'd rather be dead

1346
00:49:55,259 --> 00:49:58,137
Sucking on some cherry so red

1347
00:49:58,178 --> 00:49:59,638
We really have to do this?

1348
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,766
Yes, we have to maintain
a negative curb appeal.

1349
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:04,268
But I love our house.

1350
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,537
Hey, me too. I wanna stay in it

1351
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:07,438
with you and Fred forever.

1352
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,069
It's the pits, it's the pits

1353
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:17,781
Well,

1354
00:50:17,823 --> 00:50:19,950
what do you think?

1355
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:21,452
Nice.

1356
00:50:21,493 --> 00:50:23,329
How about mine?

1357
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,289
Wow.

1358
00:50:25,331 --> 00:50:26,540
That's perfect. You did good

1359
00:50:26,582 --> 00:50:27,601
for the neighborhood, babe.

1360
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:29,209
Anything to help our family.

1361
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:31,295
Even a giant squirting penis.

1362
00:50:31,337 --> 00:50:33,839
Exactly. [laughs]

1363
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:34,840
Muah.

1364
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:37,635
Faded like the night in the sky

1365
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:41,764
Waving at the neighbors bye bye

1366
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:45,434
It's the pits, it's the pits

1367
00:50:45,476 --> 00:50:47,936
Don't look down
you stepped on shit

1368
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,960
