1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,131
You know who's gotta be the bravest
person in the Marvel Universe?

2
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:09,465
Whoever has to give She-Hulk
a bikini wax.

3
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:11,936
You wanna talk brave?

4
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:15,168
How about Captain America's
undocumented Mexican gardener?

5
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:20,014
He's not braver than whoever uses
the bathroom after The Thing.

6
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,511
As usual, you're all wrong.

7
00:00:23,753 --> 00:00:26,221
Bravest person in the Marvel Universe
is the doctor...

8
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,414
...who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,157
What about the guy who gets
a prostate exam from Wolverine?

10
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,261
Now you're just being silly.

11
00:00:36,466 --> 00:00:40,698
Wolverine's never displayed interest
in helping others prevent prostate cancer.

12
00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:46,433
Hello?

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,273
Yes, the elevator's out of order.
You'll have to use the stairs.

14
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:51,505
Of course you can.

15
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:53,979
Pizza dates back to the 16th century...

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:57,210
...while the first elevator was not installed
until 1852.

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,786
That means that for over 300 years...

18
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,390
...people carried pizzas upstairs.

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,618
Be part of that proud tradition.

20
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:09,626
I'll go get Penny
while that guy spits on our food.

21
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:14,861
Do you think they gave Wolverine
an adamantium prostate?

22
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:16,938
That's a stupid question.

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,632
We're having a conversation
about probing the heinies of superheroes.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,040
There are no stupid questions.

25
00:01:30,186 --> 00:01:32,051
- Yes?
- Oh. Uh...

26
00:01:32,222 --> 00:01:34,019
Is Penny here?

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,885
You're Leonard, right?

28
00:01:36,059 --> 00:01:37,890
Yeah.

29
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:40,255
Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.

30
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:43,528
Okay, I think
a bit of context here might help.

31
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,598
Oh, hey, Leonard.
I see you met my dad.

32
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,360
Oh, good. Context.

33
00:01:48,572 --> 00:01:50,164
Come in, buddy. Take a load off.

34
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,241
Oh, Dad, Leonard can't stay.
He just dropped by to say hello.

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,174
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.
I'll see you later.

36
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,478
Bye.

37
00:02:04,387 --> 00:02:06,412
That was odd.

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,993
Are you sure you have enough comics?

39
00:02:35,203 --> 00:02:38,400
You're monitoring the telescope
for 12 hours, and by my estimate...

40
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,508
...you've only selected seven hours
of reading material.

41
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,569
That's even factoring in your difficulty...

42
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:48,271
...in parsing American comic-book idioms
like "Bamf" and "Snikt."

43
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:51,779
Is that racist? It feels racist.

44
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:57,153
Don't be oversensitive.
He's calling you illiterate, not your race.

45
00:02:58,426 --> 00:03:00,087
Oh, okay. Good.

46
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:03,394
I don't need more comics.
Howard's gonna stop by.

47
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:06,362
We'll play Intergalactic Battleship
and Indian Monopoly.

48
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:08,933
I don't care
for novelty editions of Monopoly.

49
00:03:09,103 --> 00:03:12,402
I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.

50
00:03:13,808 --> 00:03:15,935
Actually,
Indian Monopoly's just like regular.

51
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,513
Except the money's in rupees,
instead of hotels you build call centers...

52
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,048
...and when you pick a Chance card
you might die of dysentery.

53
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,754
Oh, just FYI, that was racist.

54
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,519
You'll never guess what happened.

55
00:03:32,727 --> 00:03:35,787
You went out in the hallway,
stumbled into a portal...

56
00:03:35,963 --> 00:03:38,363
...which brought you 5000 years
into the future...

57
00:03:38,532 --> 00:03:41,865
...where you took advantage
of the technology to build a time machine.

58
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:45,528
Now you're back to bring us all to 7010,
where we are transported...

59
00:03:45,706 --> 00:03:50,370
...to work at the Thinkatorium by
telepathically-controlled flying dolphins?

60
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,010
- No.
- Oh...

61
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,213
Penny kissed me.

62
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:00,216
Well, who would ever guess that?

63
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:04,588
- What kind of a kiss?
- A big kiss, on the mouth.

64
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:07,260
Is it possible
that she was going for your cheek...

65
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:09,589
...and you moved
and she accidentally got lip?

66
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:12,858
That happens with me and my mom
all the time.

67
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:15,562
She introduced me to her father...

68
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:18,227
...kissed me
and then shut the door in my face.

69
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,536
She was trying to send you a message.

70
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:21,697
- You think?
- Yeah.

71
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,572
"This man is not my father,
I'm being held hostage...

72
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:29,242
...so I'm gonna do something insane
in the hopes that you'll call 911."

73
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,977
Penny kissing me is not insane.
She used to kiss me all the time.

74
00:04:33,187 --> 00:04:36,645
Einstein defined insanity as doing
the same thing over and over again...

75
00:04:36,824 --> 00:04:39,019
...and expecting different results.

76
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:42,794
By that standard,
Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

77
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:47,529
I'm just saying,
it felt like it may have meant something.

78
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,896
Oh, this takes me back.
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

79
00:04:51,105 --> 00:04:53,266
Don't get me wrong,
I love your new stuff...

80
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:56,205
...but once in a while,
it's nice to hear the hits.

81
00:04:57,078 --> 00:05:01,208
Ooh, ooh! Do "Our babies
will be smart and beautiful."

82
00:05:03,317 --> 00:05:05,308
That one always makes me laugh.

83
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:09,612
Why do I bother talking to you people?

84
00:05:09,824 --> 00:05:12,622
If it will make you feel better,
we rarely listen.

85
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:15,621
- Can I talk to you out here for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

86
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:20,298
I'm starting to think
we're never going to see that pizza.

87
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,034
You're probably wondering
what that was about.

88
00:05:24,238 --> 00:05:25,865
What? The kissing and everything?

89
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,009
No, women do that to me all the time.

90
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,146
The thing is, I kind of told my father
we got back together again.

91
00:05:33,347 --> 00:05:34,644
What? Why?

92
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:37,340
You're the first guy
he's ever really approved of.

93
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:40,976
You're a scientist who went to college
and you don't have a neck tattoo...

94
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,817
...or outstanding warrants, or...

95
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,720
Or a baby.

96
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,393
What kind of guys
did you used to go out with?

97
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,089
Just guys.

98
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:53,597
When I told him we split up,
he was heartbroken.

99
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:57,204
He kept bugging me, "How's Leonard?"
"Why can't you get back together?"

100
00:05:57,371 --> 00:06:00,067
"I bet Leonard never tipped a cow
over on himself."

101
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,672
So to get him off my back,
I told him we worked things out.

102
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:06,278
Really?

103
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,015
How... How did we manage that?

104
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:15,712
- What?
- I mean, did you apologize?

105
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,120
Did you have to woo me?

106
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:22,560
Get over yourself.
I whistled, you came running.

107
00:06:23,898 --> 00:06:27,095
- Yeah, no, I don't think so.
- Okay, why are you arguing about this?

108
00:06:27,268 --> 00:06:29,293
I'm saying, if we fake got back together...

109
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:31,903
...that's totally not how it fake happened.
- Oh.

110
00:06:32,306 --> 00:06:34,797
Will you please just play along
until my dad leaves?

111
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,636
Hold on, you actually want me
to deceive your father...

112
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,212
...with some sort
of sham play-acting and kissing?

113
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:42,315
Because I'm good with that.

114
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,450
Penny, you out here?

115
00:06:51,892 --> 00:06:53,826
Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.

116
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:57,553
Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse
with a lot stupider.

117
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:00,392
See? He doesn't mind.

118
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:03,128
I'm taking your gal out for dinner.
You wanna join us?

119
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:05,465
Oh, Dad, that's nice,
but Leonard has to work.

120
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,937
- Right, Leonard?
- I do, I have to work.

121
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:11,909
But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the
evening with my sweetie and her father...

122
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,979
...because it's
just the kind of boyfriend I am.

123
00:07:14,148 --> 00:07:15,240
Oh...

124
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:17,849
- Come here, you.
- Oh...

125
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:28,253
- C-7.
- Miss.

126
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:31,090
How could that be a miss?
C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

127
00:07:31,265 --> 00:07:33,495
Part of your starship has to be on C-7.

128
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:36,934
Not if it has a hole in the middle.

129
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:40,841
What kind of spaceship
has a hole in the middle?

130
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:45,302
A Romulan battle bagel?

131
00:07:47,381 --> 00:07:48,473
Knock, knock.

132
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:50,378
Oh, great, you made it. Come on in.

133
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:52,946
I invited her.

134
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:54,815
So where's the telescope?

135
00:07:54,989 --> 00:07:57,480
Well, it's in Hawaii,
but Raj controls it from here.

136
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,888
He's hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim...

137
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:02,995
...which would be evidence
of a planet orbiting it.

138
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:07,157
So we just sit and stare at the screen,
waiting for something to happen?

139
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:10,235
I did it with you
when we rented The Notebook.

140
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,874
Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.

141
00:08:18,145 --> 00:08:21,876
You better open up that bottle of wine
or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.

142
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:23,311
Okay.

143
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:25,315
Excuse me, I can't be drinking.

144
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,954
I'm about to make
an important scientific discovery here.

145
00:08:28,122 --> 00:08:31,114
What...? Galileo did his best work
while drinking wine.

146
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:33,657
- How do you know that?
- Well, he was Italian.

147
00:08:33,827 --> 00:08:36,227
It's a reasonable assumption.

148
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:40,356
Dude, can you even open your mouth
without spewing a cultural stereotype?

149
00:08:40,534 --> 00:08:42,559
I'm sorry, Galileo drank diet Sprite.

150
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:47,406
Look, you're my best friend,
she's my girlfriend, you should bond.

151
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,634
You know, like you and my mom did.

152
00:08:49,843 --> 00:08:52,539
Your mom creeps the hell out of me.

153
00:08:53,013 --> 00:08:57,211
Yes, but she's stopped calling you
Slumdog Millionaire.

154
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,181
I do appreciate that.

155
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:01,013
Here we go.

156
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:03,656
Oh, well, I'd like to propose a toast.

157
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,791
To science and friendship.

158
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:09,285
Hold on. Wait.

159
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,725
- No, it's okay, go ahead.
- What?

160
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:15,265
I was working with penicillin-resistant
gonorrhea in the lab today...

161
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:18,428
...and I was just trying to remember
if I washed my hands.

162
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,542
- Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.
- My pleasure.

163
00:09:27,715 --> 00:09:31,947
It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend
of Penny's that knows how to use a napkin.

164
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,111
So not funny, Dad.

165
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:37,586
Let me tell you about this one genius.
This fella Donnie.

166
00:09:37,758 --> 00:09:39,123
Will you please let it go?

167
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:42,456
Donnie was gonna make millions
turning farm waste into biofuel...

168
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,393
...and selling it to the government.

169
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,795
- A lot of people are doing that.
- Oh, see?

170
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:49,333
But all Donnie did
was mix pig poop with water...

171
00:09:49,503 --> 00:09:51,630
...and pump it into his mom's Camry.

172
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,306
Yeah, that's great.
It's a funny story, moving on.

173
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:56,807
Donnie was a rocket scientist...

174
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:59,741
...compared to that boy who wanted
to get beer pong into the Olympics.

175
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,437
- What was his name?
- Curtis.

176
00:10:01,615 --> 00:10:04,413
- And I'm pretty sure he was joking.
- Well, I don't know.

177
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:06,576
That petition looked real to me.

178
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:10,218
Okay, I think this ends
the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.

179
00:10:10,424 --> 00:10:13,257
Well, I'm just glad
you finally found yourself a keeper.

180
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:14,519
Thanks, Wyatt.

181
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:17,421
I'm a keeper.

182
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,393
You wanna come in for a nightcap?

183
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,232
Dad, he'd love to,
but Leonard has to work in the morning.

184
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,534
- Maybe I could go in a little late.
- No, no, no, you can't.

185
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:31,973
Your career is far too important.

186
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:36,640
Behind every man is a nagging woman
who won't let him have any fun, right?

187
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:39,452
Don't I know it.

188
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:43,280
- Well, good night, son.
- Good night, Wyatt.

189
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,392
- Oh, good night, honey.
- Good night.

190
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:49,255
I love you.

191
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:54,329
I love you too. Heh, heh.

192
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:05,801
Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again.

193
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,613
Three, four, five, pass go...

194
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:17,814
...get 2000 rupees, six, seven...

195
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,119
Whoops! Can't go any further,
there's a sacred cow in my way.

196
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:24,329
Tell your boyfriend
to cool it with the cow jokes.

197
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:28,558
It won't help. Once he finds
a joke he likes, he sticks with it.

198
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,928
- Like his haircut material.
- Oh, right.

199
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:34,541
- "Did you get your hair cut?"
- "No, I got them all cut."

200
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:37,634
Which is still so funny.

201
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:42,914
When you go to a Chinese restaurant, he
gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.

202
00:11:43,117 --> 00:11:46,348
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner
in a Chinese fortune-cookie factory."

203
00:11:48,489 --> 00:11:50,650
Okay, I think that's enough about me.

204
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,859
He's right. Let's make fun of his mother.

205
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:56,388
"Howard, come rub my feet.

206
00:11:56,563 --> 00:11:58,588
My corns are killing me."

207
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,566
"Howard, help me out of the tub.

208
00:12:02,736 --> 00:12:04,670
I'm stuck again."

209
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,266
Coming.

210
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,012
Hey, love bug.

211
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:17,578
Shut up.

212
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:20,150
You know what I've been doing
for the last hour?

213
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,619
Dreamily doodling
"Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter" in a notebook?

214
00:12:24,324 --> 00:12:27,191
Listening to my father go on
about what a great guy you are.

215
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:30,329
You gotta admit, I'm delightful.

216
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:33,763
Why are you making this so difficult?

217
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:37,960
- It's not difficult for me, I'm having fun.
- Leonard.

218
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,639
What do you want me to do?

219
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,071
- Do you wanna tell him we're broken up?
- No.

220
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:43,869
- Then what do you want?
- I don't know.

221
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:47,775
Don't you think that's something
you should have figured out?

222
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:49,609
Maybe.

223
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,713
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

224
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,717
I'd like to say I'm very happy
that you're back together...

225
00:12:54,922 --> 00:12:59,325
...and if I can figure out a way to do so
and sound sincere, I will.

226
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:03,792
In the meantime, I'd like to go over some
changes to the Roommate Agreement...

227
00:13:03,964 --> 00:13:07,491
...specifically to address
Penny's annoying personal habits.

228
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, my God. What personal habits?

229
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:11,296
I have a list.

230
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:15,241
FYI, overuse of the phrase
"Oh, my God" is Number 12.

231
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,574
Sheldon, you don't have to do this,
because Leonard and I are no...

232
00:13:19,746 --> 00:13:23,182
- Bup, bup. You wanna include him in this?
- Include me in what?

233
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,343
Is there a plot afoot?
I'll have no truck with plots.

234
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:32,652
No, you're right.
No, there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

235
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,351
So, what other annoying habits
shall we discuss?

236
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,087
We don't discuss anything.

237
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:39,824
Leonard is the signatory
to the Roommate Agreement...

238
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,460
...as such, he bears responsibility for all
your infractions and must pay all fines.

239
00:13:45,739 --> 00:13:46,899
- Fines?
- Yes.

240
00:13:47,107 --> 00:13:51,043
If Penny's spending nights here again,
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

241
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:56,941
Hello, Hawaii.

242
00:13:57,117 --> 00:13:59,585
This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

243
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:02,517
I'd like you
to reposition the telescope, please.

244
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:05,021
Scarlett Johansson's house.

245
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:10,924
I'm kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo.

246
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:12,463
Whoo!

247
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:17,029
It might have been a mistake
to open that second bottle of wine.

248
00:14:17,604 --> 00:14:19,401
Well, live and learn.

249
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,570
You think this planet you're looking for
has an atmosphere that supports life?

250
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:25,870
Maybe.

251
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:29,538
If it did, I'd be famous.
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

252
00:14:29,716 --> 00:14:33,447
And then instead of living alone in my
tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

253
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:36,384
- Well, that sounds great.
- It is.

254
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:40,459
If you like wandering around a big
empty house with no one to love you.

255
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,890
- We'd come visit you.
- No, you wouldn't.

256
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,091
You'd be intimidated
by my wealth and fame.

257
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:52,066
My only friends would be my
genetically-engineered monkey butler...

258
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,640
...and the little people I hired
to be my living chess set.

259
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:59,842
He's taking a turn to the dark side.

260
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,345
- Oh, hold on, he could come back.
- What's the point of everything?

261
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,415
Nope. He's gone.

262
00:15:06,086 --> 00:15:08,646
It's more than a year
since I've kissed a girl.

263
00:15:08,855 --> 00:15:11,756
What about that hookup at Comic-Con
you told me about?

264
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,451
Grow up, I was lying, I lie all the time.
Nobody wants to kiss me.

265
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,093
You poor, poor thing.

266
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,859
Raj, you have to know,
you're a wonderful man.

267
00:15:21,068 --> 00:15:24,094
There are a lot of girls out there
who wanna kiss you.

268
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:27,069
- Where?
- You just have to look.

269
00:15:30,577 --> 00:15:33,603
No!

270
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,783
Well, this was fun.

271
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,729
Oh, I think I got a nibble.

272
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,731
Oh, be careful. Give him some line.

273
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:58,832
Okay, now reel him in.

274
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:02,471
Oh, look at that baby.
They're really biting, huh?

275
00:16:02,676 --> 00:16:05,144
Yeah, they do that
when you set it on "easy."

276
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:09,481
Oh, that's me.

277
00:16:10,517 --> 00:16:12,815
Hello? Oh, hi, sweetie.

278
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:14,954
I got up early
and didn't wanna wake you...

279
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:17,989
...so I went out for coffee,
ran into Leonard on the way back.

280
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:20,558
Guess what. We're fishing.

281
00:16:21,128 --> 00:16:23,187
Yeah, right here on his couch.

282
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:26,258
Hey, baby, I love you.

283
00:16:28,368 --> 00:16:31,895
That's Leonard. He says he loves you.

284
00:16:32,873 --> 00:16:34,397
What?

285
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:37,434
I see.

286
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,271
The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

287
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:43,578
Well, that's very disappointing.

288
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,440
Bye.

289
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:55,452
Oh, hey, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

290
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,524
I can't believe you would lie to me.

291
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:03,191
- I did not wanna be a part of this.
- I'll get to you in a minute.

292
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,462
No hurry.

293
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:07,402
My daughter thinks I don't love her
enough to support her...

294
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:09,474
...no matter what choices she makes.

295
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,974
- I'm sorry, Daddy...
- Let me finish.

296
00:17:12,212 --> 00:17:15,272
I thought we were past the days
when you'd pull the wool over my eyes.

297
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,748
Telling me the baggie
in your underwear drawer is potpourri.

298
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,448
And the pee stick in your bathroom
is to check for diabetes.

299
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,989
I know. I'm sorry.

300
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,790
I respect your right
to make your own decisions...

301
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:35,196
...but all I ask is you respect me enough
to be honest about them.

302
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,996
You're right.
From now on, I will tell you the truth.

303
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,229
Thank you.
Now go and put some clothes on.

304
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:42,705
We'll grab a bite
before I head for the airport.

305
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,342
- Okay.
- Now you...

306
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:46,739
- He had nothing to do... Okay.
- Keep walking.

307
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:53,845
Please, please,
please don't give up on her.

308
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:57,346
What?

309
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,583
I can't go back to the skateboard idiots,
the white rappers...

310
00:18:00,761 --> 00:18:04,253
...and all the sweaty dumb-asses
with their backwards hats.

311
00:18:05,665 --> 00:18:08,361
Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

312
00:18:08,602 --> 00:18:09,864
Then stack the deck.

313
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:13,606
Cheat, lie, I don't care.

314
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:18,177
I want grandkids and I want them
to grow up in a house without wheels.

315
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:26,380
- I'll give it a shot.
- Thank you.

316
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,955
Now, I'm gonna do something here
to help you along.

317
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:31,522
- Excuse me?
- Just don't panic.

318
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:34,125
Now get your sorry,
lying ass out of my face...

319
00:18:34,294 --> 00:18:36,353
...and make sure I never see it again.

320
00:18:36,563 --> 00:18:39,691
Oh, the reverse-psychology thing.
I see, that's very clever.

321
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,300
Don't yap. Just get out.

322
00:18:43,003 --> 00:18:44,402
I'll friend you on Facebook.

323
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:53,504
Oh, there you are.

324
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,545
Just so you know, I was up all night...

325
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:58,650
...but I've finally completed
the Penny-specific section...

326
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:00,912
...of the new Roommate Agreement.

327
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:04,422
Yeah? Well, not necessary,
we broke up again.

328
00:19:17,103 --> 00:19:19,833
Do you even think about other people,
Leonard?

329
00:19:22,609 --> 00:19:24,509
Do you?

330
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,729
Hey. Oh, how did it go last night?

331
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:37,638
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

332
00:19:37,807 --> 00:19:40,833
Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars, big whoop.

333
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:44,071
Really? You waited months
for time with that telescope.

334
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:46,715
- What happened?
- Why, you writing a book?

335
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:49,816
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

336
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:54,320
Last night, Raj accidentally made
contact with an alien civilization...

337
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:59,458
...and has been ordered by the
U.S. Government to keep it a secret.

338
00:20:01,097 --> 00:20:03,327
Nothing happened.
Can we change the subject?

339
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:06,331
That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.

340
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:09,732
- Hey.
- Hello.

341
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:11,763
- Hey.
- Hey.

342
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:16,774
Did you get to play
with Raj's big telescope last night?

343
00:20:17,513 --> 00:20:19,708
- Wha...?
- Wha...?

344
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:24,075
- Where did that come from?
- He never touched my telescope.

345
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,881
- Way to go shutting up.
- I did shut up. Now you shut up.

346
00:20:27,056 --> 00:20:28,921
- Fine.
- Thank you.

347
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:36,129
I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.
