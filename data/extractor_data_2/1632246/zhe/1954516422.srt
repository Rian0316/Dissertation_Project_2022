1
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,320

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,170
You know who's gonna be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe?

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,700
Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,700

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,090
You want to talk brave,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,720
how about Captain America's undocumented Mexican gardener?

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,720

8
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,430
He's not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,460
As usual, you're all wrong.

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,320
The bravest person in the Marvel Universe

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,050
is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,570
How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,340
Now you're just being silly.

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,340
Wolverine's never displayed

15
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,830
the slightest interest in helping others

16
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,820
prevent prostate cancer.

17
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,160
Hello.

18
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,350
Yes, the elevator's out of order;

19
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,520
you'll have to use the stairs.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,800
Of course you can.

21
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
Pizza dates back to the 16th century,

22
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,470
while the first elevator was not installed until 1852.

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,040
That means that for over 300 years,

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,730
people carried pizzas up stairs.

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,030
Be part of that proud tradition.

26
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,560
I'll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,110
Do you think they gave Wolverine an adamantium prostate?

28
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,940
That's a stupid question.

29
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,600
We're having a conversation about probing the heinie of superheroes.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,850
There are no stupid questions.

31
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,980
Yes?

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,860
Oh, um, is Penny here?

33
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,920
You're Leonard, right?

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,620
Yeah.

35
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,970
Damn, it's good to finally meet you, son.

36
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,900
Okay, I think a bit of context here might help.

37
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,760
Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad.

38
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,310
Oh, good.

39
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,660
Context.

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,630
Come on in, buddy.

41
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,380
Take a load off.

42
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,860
Oh, gee, Dad, Leonard can't stay.

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,260
He just dropped by to say hello.

44
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,490
Thanks for stopping by, sweetie.

45
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,690
I'll see you later.

46
00:01:58,730 --> 00:01:59,930
Bye.

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,020
That was odd.

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,220
Are you sure you have enough comics?

49
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,720
You're going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours,

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,470
and by my estimate, you've only selected

51
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,700
seven hours of reading material.

52
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,500
That's even factoring in

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,970
your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms

54
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,050
like "Bamf!" and "Snikt!"

55
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,410
Is that racist?

56
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,910
It feels racist.

57
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,450
Don't be oversensitive.

58
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,340
He's calling you illiterate, not your race.

59
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,560
Oh, okay. Good.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,270
I don't need more comics.

61
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,630
Howard's gonna stop by, we're gonna play

62
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,410
Intergalactic Battleship and Indian Monopoly.

63
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,280
I don't care for novelty editions of Monopoly.

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,210
I prefer the classics: regular and Klingon.

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,140
Actually, Indian Monopoly's

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,410
just like regular, except the money's in rupees,

67
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,670
instead of hotels you build call centers,

68
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,930
and when you pick a Chance card, you might die of dysentery.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,830
Just FYI,

70
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,640
that was racist.

71
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,980
You'll never guess what just happened.

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,350
You went out in the hallway,

73
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,200
stumbled into an interdimensional portal

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
which brought you 5,000 years into the future,

75
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,290
where you took advantage of the advanced technology

76
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,610
to build a time machine, and now you're back

77
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,960
to bring us all with you to the year 7010

78
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,290
where we are transported to work at the Thinkatorium

79
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,410
by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?

80
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,430
No.

81
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,320
Penny kissed me.

82
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,490
Well, who would ever guess that?

83
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,620
What-what kind of a kiss?

84
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,730
A big kiss. On the mouth.

85
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,020
Is it possible that she was going for your cheek

86
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,880
and you moved and she accidentally got lip?

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,590
That happens with me and my mom all the time.

88
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,770
She introduced me to her father,

89
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:19,000
kissed me and then shut the door in my face.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,990
Maybe she was trying to send you a message.

91
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,670
You think?

92
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah. "This man is not my father.

93
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,350
I'm being held hostage.

94
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,100
So I'm going to do

95
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,210
something insane in the hopes

96
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,990
that you'll call 911."

97
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,530
Penny kissing me is not insane.

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,020
She used to kiss me all the time.

99
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,890
Einstein defined insanity as "Doing the same thing

100
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:39,230
over and over again and expecting different results."

101
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,840
By that standard,

102
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,320
Penny is cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

103
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,720
I'm just saying,

104
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,780
it felt like it may have meant something.

105
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,460
Ah, this takes me back.

106
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,470
Leonard obsessing about Penny.

107
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,540
I mean, don't get me wrong, I love your new stuff,

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,430
but once in a while it's nice to hear the hits.

109
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,970
Do "Our babies will be smart and beautiful."

110
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,680
That one always makes me laugh.

111
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,600
Why do I bother talking to you people?

112
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
If it'll make you feel better, we rarely listen.

113
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,470
Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?

114
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,010
Yeah, sure.

115
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,500
I'm starting to think we're never going to see that pizza.

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,070
So you're probably wondering what that was all about.

117
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,940
What, uh, the kissing and everything?

118
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,710
Nah, women do that to me all the time.

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,380
Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of

120
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,540
told my father we got back together again.

121
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,970
What? Why?

122
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,060
Well, you're the first guy

123
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,690
he's ever really approved of, you know?

124
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,750
You're a scientist who went to college

125
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,030
and you don't have a neck tattoo

126
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,640
or outstanding warrants or...or a baby.

127
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,150
What kind of guys did you used to go out with?

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,460
Just guys.

129
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,710
Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken,

130
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,430
and he kept bugging me,"How's Leonard?

131
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,010
Why can't you get back together with Leonard?

132
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,900
I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself."

133
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,900

134
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
So to get him off my back,

135
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,910
I told him we worked things out.

136
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,470
Really?

137
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,110
How-how'd we manage that?

138
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,670
What?

139
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,050
I mean, did you apologize?

140
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,130
Did you have to woo me?

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,490
Get over yourself.

142
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,460
I whistled, you came running.

143
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
Yeah, no, I don't think so.

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,450
Okay, why are you arguing about this?

145
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,160
I'm just saying,

146
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,230
if we fake got back together,

147
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,940
that's totally not how it fake happened.

148
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,070
Okay, whatever.

149
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,980
Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?

150
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,400
Hold on, you actually want me

151
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,510
to deceive your father with some sort of

152
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,280
sham playacting and kissing?

153
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,200
'Cause I'm good with that.

154
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,100
Penny, you out here?

155
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,070
Come on, honey, not in front of my dad.

156
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,690
Relax, I've seen you do a lot worse

157
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,430
with a lot stupider.

158
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,840
See? He doesn't mind.

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,150
So, Leonard, I'm taking your gal out

160
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,510
for a steak dinner; you want to join us?

161
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh, Dad, that's nice, but Leonard has to work.

162
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,580
Right, Leonard?

163
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,240
Uh, I do, I have to work.

164
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,930
But I'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening

165
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,410
with my sweetie and her father, 'cause, you know,

166
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,590
just the kind of boyfriend I am.

167
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,880
Come here, you.

168
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,780
C-7
C-7.

169
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,540
Miss.

170
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,400
How could that be a miss?

171
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,300
C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit.

172
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,640
Part of your starship has to be on C-7.

173
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,890
Not if it has a hole in the middle.

174
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,900
What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?

175
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,230
A Romulan Battle Bagel?

176
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,630
Knock-knock.

177
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,900
Oh, great, you made it.

178
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,110
Come on in.

179
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,680
I invited her.

180
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,080
So where's the telescope?

181
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,870
It's in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here.

182
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,870
He's hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be

183
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,220
evidence of a planet orbiting it.

184
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,960
So we just sit and stare at the screen,

185
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,080
waiting for something to happen?

186
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,610
I did it with you when we rented the Note Book.

187
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,560
Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure.

188
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,730
You'd better open up that bottle of wine

189
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,880
or I'm gonna end up with swimmer's ear.

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,710
Excuse me.

191
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,200
I can't be drinking, I'm about to make

192
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,040
an important scientific discovery here.

193
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,580
What? Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.

194
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,600
How do you know that?

195
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,050
Well, he was Italian.

196
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,860
It's a reasonable assumption.

197
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,900
Dude, can you even open your mouth

198
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,710
without spewing a cultural stereotype?

199
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,180
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Galileo drank Diet Sprite.

200
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,400
Look, you're my best friend, she's my girlfriend;

201
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,590
you should bond.

202
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,590
You know, like you and my mom did.

203
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,250
Your mom creeps the hell out of me.

204
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,620
Yes, but she's stopped calling you Slumdog Millionaire.

205
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,030
I do appreciate that.

206
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,400
Here we go.

207
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,620
I'd like to propose a toast.

208
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,140
To science and friendship.

209
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,310
Hold on. Wait.

210
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,240
No, it's okay, go ahead.

211
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,950
What?

212
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,930
Oh, I was working with

213
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,030
penicillin-resistant gonorrhea in the lab today

214
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,120
and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands.

215
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,740
Thanks for the steak, Wyatt.

216
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:27,990
My pleasure.

217
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,520
It's nice to have dinner with a boyfriend of Penny's

218
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,530
that knows how to use a napkin.

219
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,260
So not funny, Dad.

220
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,620
Let me tell you about this one genius she was going out with,

221
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,050
this-this fella Donnie.

222
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,460
Oh, will you please let it go?

223
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,630
Donnie was gonna make millions turning farm waste

224
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,220
into biofuel and selling it to the government.

225
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,460
A lot of people are doing that.

226
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,360
Oh, see?

227
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,220
Yeah, but all Donnie did was mix pig poop with a little water

228
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,440
and pump it into his mom's Camry.

229
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,750
Yeah, that's great.

230
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,430
It's a funny story. Moving on.

231
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,020
And Donnie was a rocket scientist

232
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,680
compared to that boy

233
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,780
who wanted to get beer pong into the Olympics.

234
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,120
What was his name, sweetheart?

235
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,510
Curtis, and I'm pretty sure he was joking.

236
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,340
I don't know.

237
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,260
That petition looked real to me.

238
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,450
Yeah, okay, I think this ends

239
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,770
the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening.

240
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,600
Well, I'm just glad you finally found yourself a keeper.

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,090
Thanks, Wyatt.

242
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:17,720
I'm a keeper.

243
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,540
Leonard, you want to come in for a nightcap?

244
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,600
Oh, gee, Dad, he'd love to,

245
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,800
but Leonard has to work in the morning.

246
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,270
Maybe I could go in a little late.

247
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,660
No, no, no, you can't.

248
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,070
Your career is far too important.

249
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,900
Behind every great man is a nagging woman

250
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,490
who won't let him have any fun, am I right, Leonard?

251
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,420
Don't I know it.

252
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,060
Well, good night, son.

253
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,240
Good night, Wyatt.

254
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,710
Oh, good night, honey.

255
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,170
Good night.

256
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,600
I love you.

257
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,210
Love you, too.

258
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,720
Oh, friggety-frak.

259
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,630
Not this again.

260
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:15,140
Three, four, five-- pass go, get 2,000 rupees--

261
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,200
6  7
six, seven.

262
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,410
Whoops. Can't go any further. There's a sacred cow in my way.

263
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,360
Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend

264
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,780
to cool it with the cow jokes.

265
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,670
It won't help.

266
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,310
Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it.

267
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,190
Yeah.

268
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,770
Like his haircut material.

269
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,680
Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?

270
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,800
"No. I got them all cut."

271
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,500
Which is still so funny.

272
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,800
And when you go to a Chinese restaurant,

273
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,330
he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie.

274
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,070
Right. "Help, I'm a prisoner

275
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,520
in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."

276
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,190
Okay, I think that's enough about me.

277
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,890
He's right. Let's make fun of his mother.

278
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,450
"Howard, come rub my feet!

279
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,620
My corns are killing me!"

280
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,850
"Howard, help me out of the tub!

281
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,920
I'm stuck again!"

282
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,350
Coming.

283
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,260
Hey, lovebug.

284
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,900
Shut up.

285
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,940
You know what I've been doing for the last hour?

286
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,640
Mm, dreamily doodling "Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter"

287
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,270
in a notebook?

288
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,360
Listening to my father go on and on

289
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,980
about what a great guy you are.

290
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,880
You got to admit, I am... I'm delightful.

291
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,970
Why are you making this so difficult?

292
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,080
It's not difficult for me.

293
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm having fun.

294
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,520
Leonard.

295
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,270
What do you want me to do? You started this.

296
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,950
Do you want to go over and tell him we're broken up?

297
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,360
- No. - Well, then, what do you want?

298
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,280
I don't know.

299
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,400
Don't you think that's something you should

300
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,430
have figured out before you stomped over here?

301
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,070
Maybe.

302
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,370
Leonard, Penny, excellent.

303
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,090
I'd like to say I'm very happy that you're back together,

304
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,080
and if I can figure out a way to do so

305
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,370
and sound sincere, I will.

306
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,190
In the meantime,

307
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,070
I'd like to go over some proposed changes

308
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,530
to the roommate agreement specifically to address

309
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,740
Penny's annoying personal habits.

310
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,200
Oh, my God.

311
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,230
- What personal habits? - I have a list.

312
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,630
FYI, overuse of the phrase "Oh, my God" is number 12.

313
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,700
Okay, Sheldon, you don't have to do this

314
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,430
- because Leonard and I are not... Ba-ba-ba-ba.

315
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,290
Are you sure you want to include him in this?

316
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,870
Include me in what?

317
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,170
Is there a plot afoot?

318
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,090
I'll have no truck with plots.

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,110
No, you're right.

320
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,220
No, there's... there's no plots, no trucks, no feet.

321
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,550
So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?

322
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,780
Uh, we don't discuss anything.

323
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,460
Leonard is the signatory to the roommate agreement.

324
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,170
As such, he bears responsibility

325
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,540
for all your infractions and must pay all fines.

326
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,280
- Fines? - Yes.

327
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,810
If Penny's going to be spending nights here again,

328
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,470
you'll need to set up an escrow account.

329
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,130
Sign here.

330
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,490
Hello, Hawaii.

331
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:59,240
This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena.

332
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,260
I'd like you to reposition the telescope, please.

333
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,140
Scarlett Johansson's house!

334
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,270
I'm kidding, Hawaii.

335
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,830
Mahalo.

336
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,920
Whoo!

337
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,500
It might have been a mistake

338
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,030
to open that second bottle of wine.

339
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,930
Well, live and learn.

340
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,620
So, Raj, do you think this planet you're looking for

341
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,140
could have an atmosphere that supports life?

342
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,270
Maybe.

343
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,280
If it did, I'd be famous.

344
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,120
I'd be on the cover of magazines.

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,480
And then, instead of living alone

346
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,130
in my tiny apartment, I'd have a big mansion.

347
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,280
That sounds great.

348
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,980
It is.

349
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,700
If you like wandering around a big, empty house

350
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,850
with no one to love you.

351
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,070
- We'd come visit you. - No, you wouldn't.

352
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,020
You'd be intimidated by my wealth and fame.

353
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,360
My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler

354
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,850
and the little people I hired to be my living chess set.

355
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,550
He's taking a turn to the dark side, isn't he?

356
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,280
Hold on. He could come back.

357
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,970
Oh, what's the point of everything?

358
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,790
Nope. He's gone.

359
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,330
You know it's been more than a year

360
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,410
since I've even kissed a girl?

361
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,800
What about that hookup at Comic-Con you told me about?

362
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,180
Oh, grow up. I was lying.

363
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,750
I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me.

364
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,690
Oh, you poor, poor thing.

365
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,500
Raj, you have to know you're a wonderful man.

366
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,690
There are a lot of girls out there who'll want to kiss you.

367
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,670
Where?

368
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,080
You just have to look.

369
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,020
Well, this was fun.

370
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,540
Oh! I think I got a nibble.

371
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,220
Oh, be careful.

372
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,780
Give him some line.

373
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,940
Okay, now reel him in.

374
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,410
Oh, look at that baby.

375
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,820
They're really biting, huh?

376
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,530
Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.

377
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
Oh, that's me.

378
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh, hi, sweetie.

379
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,240
Yeah, I got up early and didn't want to wake you,

380
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,300
so I went out for coffee and ran into Leonard on the way back.

381
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,750
Guess what-- we're fishing.

382
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,150
Yeah. Right here on his couch.

383
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,690
Hey, baby. I love you!

384
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,230
That's Leonard.

385
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,920
Says he loves you.

386
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,010
What?

387
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,210
I see.

388
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,840
The whole thing's bull squirt, huh?

389
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,790
Well, that's very disappointing. Bye.

390
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,900
There's been something I've been meaning to tell you.

391
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,780
I can't believe you would lie to me like that.

392
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,560
Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this.

393
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,340
I'll get to you in a minute.

394
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,890
No hurry.

395
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,060
That my own daughter thinks I don't love her enough

396
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,760
to support her no matter what choices she makes--

397
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,030
well, that hurts me deeply.

398
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,650
- I'm sorry, Daddy... - Let me finish.

399
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,440
I thought we were past the days

400
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,740
when you would try to pull the wool over my eyes.

401
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,560
Telling me the baggie in your underwear drawer is potpourri?

402
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,510
And the pee stick in your bathroom is to check for diabetes?

403
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,690
You know, I'm sorry.

404
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,360
You're a grown woman, and I respect your right

405
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
to make your own decisions,

406
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,460
but all I ask is you respect me enough

407
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,780
to be honest about them.

408
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,440
You're right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth.

409
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,050
Thank you. Now, why don't you go and put some clothes on

410
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,650
and we'll grab a bite to eat before I head for the airport.

411
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
- Now you... - Daddy, he had nothing to do...

412
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,310
- Keep walking.  - Okay.

413
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,100
Please, please, please don't give up on her.

414
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,920
What?

415
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,720
I can't go back to the skateboard idiots, the white rappers

416
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,420
and all those sweaty dumb-asses with their backwards hats.

417
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,930
Gee, I don't know if it's in the cards, sir.

418
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,160
Then, stack the deck.

419
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,250
Cheat. Lie. I don't care.

420
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,580
I want grandkids before I die,

421
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,590
and I want them to grow up in a house without wheels.

422
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,750
- I'll give it a shot.  - Thank you.

423
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,200
Now I'm going to do something here to help you along.

424
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
- Excuse me?  - Just don't panic.

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,750
Now, get your sorry, lying ass out of my face

426
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,020
and make sure I never see it again!

427
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,250
Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. That's very clever.

428
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,600
Don't yap. Just get out.

429
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,790
I'll friend you on Facebook.

430
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,050
Oh, there you are.

431
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,040
Just so you know, I was up all night,

432
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,610
but I have finally completed

433
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,190
the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement.

434
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,580
Yeah well, not necessary. We broke up again.

435
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,230
Do you even think about other people, Leonard?

436
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,610
Do you?

437
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,190
Oh, how'd it go last night?

438
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,450
Oh, you know.

439
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,250
Same old, same old.

440
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,950
Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop.

441
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,650
Really?

442
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,110
You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?

443
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,860
Why? You writing a book?

444
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,430
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

445
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,940
Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization

446
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,740
and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret.

447
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,020
Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?

448
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,640
That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.

449
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,260
You get to play with Raj's big telescope last night?

450
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,080
Where did that come from?

451
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,560
He never touched my telescope.

452
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,070
Way to go shutting up.

453
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,420
I did shut up. Now you shut up.

454
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,200
- Fine.  - Thank you.

455
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:36,020
I can't believe you didn't call me this morning.
