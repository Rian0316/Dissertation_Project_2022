13
00:00:36,683 --> 00:00:39,566

awoke that morning,</i>

15
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:44,666

this would be the day</i>

16
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,332

17
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,599
<i>Certainly,
it began normally enough.</i>

18

<i>She put away the groceries

20
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:04,533
<i>She folded the towels
just as he had taught her.</i>

21
00:01:06,165 --> 00:01:09,200
<i>It was just before noon...</i>

22
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:12,866

27
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:26,800

I'll let her know
that you dropped by.

60
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:42,966
<i>Yes, Orson Hodge was a man</i>

Here, you can have this.

78
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:49,518
<i>while resisting the urge
to strangle the girl's mother.</i>

79
00:04:51,693 --> 00:04:54,533
<i>This happened just after
Susan Mayer learned</i>

80

83
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,432
<i>At that same moment,</i>

84
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:09,267
<i>Edie Britt was putting up
a "for sale" sign</i>

85

86
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,900

87
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,900
<i>by washing down the driveway.</i>

88
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,900
<i>but she was pleased to see</i>

89
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:24,299
<i>the rain had already
taken care of that.</i>

90
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,167
<i>This is what rainy days
are good for.</i>

91
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,332
<i>They make everything clean
again,</i>

92
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:36,966

found her severed fingers

- <font color=#ff0000><i>(woman)</i></font> Oh, no!

100
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,399
And they never found
Felicia's body.

101
00:06:14,168 --> 00:06:16,133
I wouldn't be surprised
if someday you opened a cabinet,

102
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:17,566
and... hello!

103
00:06:17,943 --> 00:06:20,233
Karen, dear. Have you seen
the marble backsplash?

104
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:23,900
Oh, I just must show it to you.
Excuse us.

105
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:26,900
What are you trying to do to me,
you backstabbing cow?

106
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,900
They asked why the owner
was selling.

107
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:32,633
I told them that Paul young
was in jail. They asked why.

108
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,167
Conversation has a flow.

109
00:06:34,836 --> 00:06:35,633
Well, knock it off.

110
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:38,133
I've been trying to unload

112
00:06:40,972 --> 00:06:43,332
Ah-ah-ah! Those are

00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:44,833

114
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,833
Good luck trying to find
one of those.

115
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:49,411
Maybe you'll have an easier
time with the Applewhite house

116

Honey, thank you for this.

a family Christmas photo

128
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:22,066

no problem, she's a great little girl.

129
00:07:22,345 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay? All right,
let's do this.

130
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:29,066

135
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,533
Tom, could I - could I -
could I check your tie again?

136
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,332
She sat down so quickly,
I didn't know what to say.

137
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,833
How about, "you're in the frame,
bitch. Move"?

138
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:54,699
No, I am sorry.

139
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:57,399
How much of her crap
do I have to put up with?

140
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,267
First,
it's the little drop-bys.

141
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,440
Then she's inviting herself
to dinner three times a week.

142
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,184
Now she wants to be
in our Christmas photo?

143
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:06,066
I'm sorry.
No, that's not happening. Hey, guys.

144
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,267
Don't fight.
It's the holidays.

147
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,167
Okay.

148
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:30,466
Kayla, honey, we gotta go.
They're kicking us out.

149
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,495
We didn't say that Kayla
couldn't be in the photo.

150
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,033
Yeah, well, you know what?

<i>If I'm not your family,
then she's not your family.</i>

152
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:44,332
It's okay. I don't have
to be in the picture.

153
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,233
Fine!

154
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,167
Fine. No, absolutely fine.

her out later.

157
00:08:53,773 --> 00:08:55,666
Fair enough. Fair enough.
Hey, everything's okay.

158
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:59,033

00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:28,366
Where are my crackers?

168
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:31,566
We're out,
but I got you a pickle.

169
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,599
Pickles and soup?
Who eats that?

170
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,200
You know,
that's all I got.

171
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:38,499
Ever heard of a store?

172
00:09:45,108 --> 00:09:46,332
You did not just do that.

173
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,599
I hate pickles.
Pick it up.

174
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:51,766
Doctor say
I only get out of bed to pee.

175
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:56,033
Better for baby, remember?

176
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,123
Don't go.

177
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:08,267
I need you to rub my feet.
They're sore, and doctor say -

178
00:10:09,539 --> 00:10:11,267
Oh, cut it out, Xiao-mei.
The doctor didn't say anything.

179
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,267
About rubbing
your chubby stumps.

180
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:14,766
Rub 'em yourself.

181
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:17,933
You treat me like dirt.

182
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:22,466
Would you rather go live
with Mr. Solis

183
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,466
in a dingy
one-bedroom apartment

184
00:10:24,467 --> 00:10:27,269
with no air conditioning
and no cable, huh?

185
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,305
No, I didn't think so.

186
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,771
You are meanest person
I know.

187
00:10:34,107 --> 00:10:36,349
<i>I am the meanest person.</i>

188
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:37,833
You've been in this country
a year.

189
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,733
Modify your nouns, damn it!

190
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:42,699
<i>What... a... bitch.</i>

191
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:49,866
I can't wait for you
to pop out that baby,

192
00:10:50,588 --> 00:10:51,406
because when you do,

193
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,965
I am putting you on the first
plane back to shanghai,

194
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,156
and you're gonna be on all fours
in a rice paddy

195
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,588
before the epidural
wears off!

196
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:02,766
But you promised to get me
apartment in Chinatown,

197
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:06,366
so I can work for my friend
in restaurant, start a new life.

198
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,299
Tell it to my Chinese friend-

199
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,233
sue me!

200
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,791
You know, we do have people
here in the hospital

201
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:26,078
who could do that. But I like doing it.
I think Mike would want me to.

202
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,599
Oops. Oh.

203
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,200
So have you got the results
of his latest M.R.I. yet?

204
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,416
I'm afraid
there was no change.

205
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:42,544
Oh. Well, how long until
you can do another one?

206
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,699
I don't want to tell you
not to be optimistic, but-

207
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,699
look, I know it's been
six months,

208
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,999
but he could still
come out of it, right?

209
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:51,238
I saw in the news there was
this woman in Peru.

210
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,466
She woke up after ten years.
- There's a reason that made the news.

211
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,176
you might think I'm naive,

212
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:58,499
but I know
he's coming back to me.

213
00:11:58,716 --> 00:11:59,427
Susan-

214
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:02,037
don't say it.
You just keep doing your job,

215
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,790
and I'll keep doing mine.
Oops.

216
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:14,499
<font color=#ff0000><i>(thunder rumbling)</i></font>

217
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,912
That risotto was perfect.

218
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:21,912
Just like you.

219
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,533
Listen, I hope
you saved room for dessert.

220
00:12:26,183 --> 00:12:28,062
I got us something special

221
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,533
from a wonderful little bakery
downtown.

222
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,566
Oh!

223
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,838
That is so adorable,

224
00:12:35,873 --> 00:12:37,666
but I don't think
I can eat another bite.

225
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,900
Well, here,
let me take half.

226
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,666
What do you say, Bree?

227
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:48,233
Will you marry me?

228
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,133
<font color=#ff0000><i>(exhales deeply)</i></font> This is
a little sudden, isn't it?

229
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,133
We've only known each other
six months,

230
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,366
but I've loved you
every minute of it.

231
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:04,133
But if you don't share
my feelings -

232
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,062
No, no. Um...

233
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:07,766
I do.

234
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:10,951
It's just that, um,
I can't help being cautious.

235
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:14,733
Since Rex, I haven't been
exactly lucky in love.

236
00:13:14,811 --> 00:13:16,076
I used to feel
the same way.

237
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,358
When Alma left me,
I was shattered,

238
00:13:19,393 --> 00:13:21,800
but I realize now it was
the luckiest day of my life

239
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,395
because it meant I was free
when I met you.

240
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:29,291
Luck can change, Bree.

241
00:13:30,234 --> 00:13:31,818
Let me change yours.

242
00:13:36,832 --> 00:13:37,966
Yes.

243
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:39,966
Yes?

244
00:14:08,575 --> 00:14:11,359
<i>Ian Hainsworth
had been miserable</i>

245
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:15,613
<i>ever since a tragic
horseback riding accident</i>

246
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:18,643
<i>had left his wife Jane
in a coma.</i>

247
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:22,211
<i>For the next three years,</i>

248
00:14:22,246 --> 00:14:25,027
<i>he shied away
from all social contact</i>

249
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,102
<i>because he wanted to be alone
with his grief.</i>

250
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:33,428
<i>Then one day,
he met Susan Mayer,</i>

251
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:37,158
<i>who,
because of her own tragedy,</i>

252
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:40,555
<i>was just as miserable
as he was.</i>

253
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,689
<i>And a friendship
slowly blossomed,</i>

254
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,333
<i>because as everyone knows,</i>

255
00:14:49,368 --> 00:14:51,656
<i>misery loves company,</i>

256
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,969
<i>And Ian was loving
this company...</i>

257
00:14:56,921 --> 00:14:59,583
<i>more and more every day.</i>

258
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,189
Two...

259
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:09,064
three - oh, itch, itch, itch,
itch, itch. Ooh!

260
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,026
Itch, itch, itch.

261
00:15:10,061 --> 00:15:12,245
Do the nurses know
you do this?

262
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,818
Oh, hey! Um, you weren't
supposed to see that.

263
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:17,356
Well, clearly.
Now, you can buy my silence

264
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:19,756
if you'll have coffee
with me.

265
00:15:19,857 --> 00:15:22,325
Oh, I would love to,
but I think I'm in a rush here.

266
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,865
I'm supposed to meet

267
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,022
my girlfriends for lunch
at 1:00. Is it 1:00 yet?

268
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:26,133
Well, you tell me.

269
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:29,157
I notice you're always rushing
into the hall to check the time,

270
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,805
so I, um...
Well, I bought you this.

271
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,505
Oh! Wow.

272
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,422
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles nervously)</i></font> Um...

273
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,454
I - I - I can't accept this.
This is too extravagant.

274
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:40,334
Oh, no, it's nothing.

275
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:41,613
There was
a guy on the sidewalk -

276
00:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,013
had a bunch of them
laid out on a blanket.

277
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:45,307
If you look closely,
it says "Folex."

278
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:48,484
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font> Still, I -

279
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,151
Well, in that case, thank you
for my cheap knockoff.

280
00:15:56,258 --> 00:15:57,145
<font color=#ff0000><i>(laughs)</i></font>

281
00:15:58,012 --> 00:15:58,982
Oh, my god. I'm late.

282
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:14,997
Hi! Hi, hi, hi.

283
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:15,530
Hi!

284
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,022
I'm so sorry I'm late.

285
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:20,256
No, that's fine.
Wow, white gloves.

286
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:22,323
What, are we having luncheon
in the 1880s?

287
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,963
Well,
it's a very elegant club.

288
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,019
You know, Orson’s been a member
here for years.

289
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,555
It'll be even nicer when
they finish the construction.

290
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,656
So you were very mysterious
on the phone.

291
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,133
Why did you wanna have lunch?

292
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,279
Well, I wanted to invite you
to a dinner

293
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:37,390
that Orson and I are having
this Saturday.

294
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,422
So you asked us to a meal
to announce another meal?

295
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:43,357
That's so... Bree of you.

296
00:16:43,392 --> 00:16:45,256
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font>
What's the occasion?

297
00:16:45,434 --> 00:16:48,356
Oh, um, no occasion.
Just a little get-together.

298
00:16:48,391 --> 00:16:50,256
What are you being
so coy about?

299
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,956
I'm not being coy.

300
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,689
She said coyly.

301
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,956
If you don't tell us,
we're not coming.

302
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,212
Oh, all right.

303
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:03,555
I wanted to wait and make
a proper announcement, but...

304
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,323
Orson and I are engaged.

305
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:08,540
Oh, my gosh!

306
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,956
Oh, let me see!
<font color=#ff0000><i>(Lynette)</i></font> Wow!

307
00:17:10,999 --> 00:17:13,056
You move fast.
I know it's quick,

308
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,223
but it just feels so right.

309
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:21,323
Orson is just the most warm,
wonderful, generous man.

310
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,989
Oh, generous. That means
he's good in the sack.

311
00:17:24,024 --> 00:17:27,323
Actually, uh, no.
We haven't had sex yet.

312
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:29,323
We're waiting
until we get married.

313
00:17:29,358 --> 00:17:32,956
<font color=#ff0000><i>(laughing loudly)</i></font>

314
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,318
Oh, my god.
You're serious?

315
00:17:39,353 --> 00:17:41,555
<font color=#ff0000><i>(Gabrielle)</i></font> No sex at all?

316
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:42,813
Not even...

317
00:17:42,848 --> 00:17:44,066
Whatever you're alluding to,
no.

318
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,923
But - but you're gonna
get married.

319
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:48,737
You wouldn't buy a car

320
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:51,156
without at least taking it
for a little test drive.

321
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:53,589
It's not like
you've never slept with a guy

322
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,295
you weren't married to.

323
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:58,089
True. Uh, I have in the past
given myself away too freely.

324
00:17:58,122 --> 00:18:00,222
How charming of you
to bring that up

325
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,589
while I'm announcing
my engagement.

326
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:04,156
But I like to think that
I have learned from my mistakes.

327
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,156
So the dinner is at 8:00,

328
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,862
and when we make
the announcement,

329
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:10,822
please, everybody, look surprised. Okay.

330
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,244
No, don't worry. I'm just
gonna replay the look I had

331
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,709
when I found out you hadn't
banged him yet. <font color=#ff0000><i>(gasps)</i></font>

333
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:24,689

334
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,323
<font color=#ff0000><i>(laughs)</i></font> That's cute.

335
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:28,666
<font color=#ff0000><i>(normal voice)</i></font>
So you invited Kayla

336
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:30,083
to Parker's birthday party,
right?

337
00:18:30,181 --> 00:18:31,321
Of course.

338
00:18:31,691 --> 00:18:33,555
And?
- And?

339
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:34,760
What did you tell Nora?

340
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:36,607
I told her that we were
picking up Kayla

341
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:39,290
for a quiet afternoon
at home.

342
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:40,783
You lied?

343
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,127
Yeah, you're damn straight
I lied.

344
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,605
I will not have that lunatic

345
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,712
ruining one more family gathering.

346
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:48,793
But Kayla’s gonna, you know,
tell Nora that we had a party,

347
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,921
and I'm just afraid that
Nora’s gonna blow a gasket.

348
00:18:55,589 --> 00:18:57,620
What?
So what are you saying,

349
00:18:57,655 --> 00:18:59,166
you're more afraid of Nora
than you are of me?

350
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:00,598
Is - is that what you think

351
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,723
I meant because that is
so not what I meant.

352
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,704
You scare the hell
out of me, baby.

353
00:19:07,332 --> 00:19:08,188
Thank you.

354
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:15,446
The coffee machine
was broken,

355
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,603
so I got us
a couple of smoothies.

356
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:18,273
They had strawberry
and strawberry.

357
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:21,637
Well, I hate strawberry,
so give me the strawberry.

358
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,889
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font>

359
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,001
Hi, Jane.
- <font color=#ff0000><i>(Ian)</i></font> Nothing-nothing against smoothies,

360
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,290
but I wouldn't mind having
some real food sometime.

361
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,656
May-maybe we could go
to a restaurant.

362
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:36,956
You mean,
like, outside the hospital?

363
00:19:37,057 --> 00:19:38,622
Yeah, you know,
l-like a date.

364
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:39,439
A date? <font color=#ff0000><i>(gasps)</i></font>

365
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,327
Oh, um...

366
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:43,880
There's a lovely little bistro
down the street.

367
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:46,589
<font color=#ff0000><i>(whispers)</i></font> I'm sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

368
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:49,860
<font color=#ff0000><i>(normal voice)</i></font> Uh, well,
that sounds, uh, just-

369
00:19:50,081 --> 00:19:51,295
that sounds great!

370
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:54,319
I mean, I hope that's okay.

371
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,296
Yeah! Uh...

372
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:03,193
So, I was, um,
I was thinking about

373
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:06,023
how that sounded just now-
the, uh, the-the date thing.

374
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:08,656
I really sprang it on you
out of nowhere.

375
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:11,323
Yes, you did.

376
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,522
Jane looked cold.

377
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,390
Oh. Thanks.

378
00:20:22,683 --> 00:20:26,023
Look, we're, um, we're both
in difficult situations.

379
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,766
I've been in mine
a lot longer than you have,

380
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:31,123
so, uh, if you're not ready,
I understand.

381
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,648
If you ever <i>should</i> be,

382
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:35,856
uh, let-let me know.

383
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:38,156
All right. <font color=#ff0000><i>(sighs)</i></font>

384
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,156
Wow, I am really hungry.

385
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,656
Well, then let's, um,
let's go to the blood bank

386
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,889
and swipe some-some sugar cookies.

387
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,123
Oh, uh, you might want
to give Jane a sponge bath

388
00:20:51,158 --> 00:20:54,390
'cause she had a little...
accident.

389
00:21:12,056 --> 00:21:12,814
Are you having a party?

390
00:21:12,849 --> 00:21:15,344
Shh! Shh! <font color=#ff0000><i>(whispers loudly)</i></font>
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!

391
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:19,477
Shh! Yeah, no, no,
of course not. In fact,

392
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:23,576
we're just having
a quiet afternoon at home.

393
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:25,124
Um, the kids are so bored.

394
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,610
Tom and I were thinking of
taking 'em out for ice cream.

395
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,443
Well, would you tell Kayla
that mommy called

396
00:21:30,703 --> 00:21:31,989
to check on her?

397
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:34,443
Oh, I will, I will,
and I'll see you tonight.

398
00:21:34,478 --> 00:21:37,809
Okay. Bye.

399
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:39,913
You think she bought it?

400
00:21:39,948 --> 00:21:43,875
No. I think she'll be
over here in ten minutes.

401
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:46,610
Okay, let's move! Let's move!
I've got 10 bucks here

402
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:50,142
for the kid who can
carry the most stuff, okay?

403
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,209
Hey, Gaby, it's Lynette.
Got a little emergency here.

404
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,643
Is it okay
if we use your backyard?

405
00:21:57,737 --> 00:22:00,209
Great. Great.

406
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,209
And we take
complete responsibility

407
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:04,543
for whatever the pony does.

408
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:07,276
Hope you get
this message soon.

409
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:09,343
Oh!

410
00:22:10,624 --> 00:22:12,842
My only concern would be
the neighborhood.

411
00:22:13,161 --> 00:22:16,309
We really need a quiet place
for our retirement.

412
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,088
Oh, are you kidding?

413
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:20,693
There's no place in Fairview
that's more peaceful.

414
00:22:21,405 --> 00:22:24,227
<font color=#ff0000><i>(Lynette)</i></font> Stay off the pony!
Okay, guys,

415
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:25,198
come on, come on, come on!

416
00:22:25,976 --> 00:22:28,142
<font color=#ff0000><i>(children
screaming and laughing)</i></font>

417
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:30,309
Let me show you
the media room.

418
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:33,142
Okay, go on in.
Got the balloons?

419
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:35,476
Good. Good. All right.

420
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:39,809
Okay, all right, that's it.
Everybody's in.

421
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,710
Where's the cake?

422
00:22:42,072 --> 00:22:44,109
Oh, crap!

423
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:49,770
<font color=#ff0000><i>(Nora)</i></font> Yoo-hoo!

424
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,942
Anybody home?

425
00:22:57,976 --> 00:22:59,976
Hello?
Hey, Nora.

426
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:03,509
Wow. We weren't expecting you
until 7:00.

427
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:05,343
So where's Kayla?

428
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,809
I thought I told you. Tom took
the kids to the movies.

429
00:23:07,842 --> 00:23:11,842
Unh-unh. You said ice cream.

430
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,476
Uh-huh. After the movies.

431
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:17,209
Movies, then ice cream--
an American tradition.

432
00:23:17,243 --> 00:23:20,209
So, is something wrong?

433
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:27,276
To be honest, I thought
that you were lying

434
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:30,443
and having a party.
I guess I was wrong.

435
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:34,309
Oh, apology accepted. Want me
to walk you to your car?

436
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:36,643
<font color=#ff0000><i>(toilet flushes)</i></font>

437
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:42,643
Where did everybody go?

438
00:23:44,476 --> 00:23:46,376
Nora, look,
I am sorry I lied,

439
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:49,509
but you know,
you gave me no choice, and--

440
00:23:49,543 --> 00:23:52,176
Lynette,
I want my daughter.

441
00:23:52,209 --> 00:23:54,976
Where's the damn party?

442
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:56,476
No, I'm not telling.

443
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:59,610
Where's the party?
<font color=#ff0000><i>(sighs)</i></font>

444
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,076
No! No, no!

445
00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:17,209
If you want in, you're gonna
have to go through me.

446
00:24:17,243 --> 00:24:20,543
I want my kid, Lynette.
Kayla!

447
00:24:20,576 --> 00:24:23,076
Kayla, come out here now!

448
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:25,376
What is going on?

449
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:28,376
Well, first you have a party,
and you don't invite me,

450
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:31,576
and then you lie about it,
so now we're leavin'.

451
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,775
Well, wait a minute.

452
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:36,276
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, Kayla.

453
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,276
I'm sorry.
We're--we're sorry.

454
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,710
We--we shouldn't have
done that.

455
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:44,343
But look, Kayla is having
such a good time.

456
00:24:44,376 --> 00:24:46,309
Why don't we all just
come on in and have some cake,

457
00:24:46,343 --> 00:24:48,076
and we can just--
Lynette, Lynette.

458
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:50,076
We can just have fun.

459
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:52,009
Could you excuse me
for one second?

460
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,875
Lynette.

461
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,710
Okay, okay, I know,
but what else could I do?

462
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,643
I'm just thinking
of Kayla.

463
00:24:58,676 --> 00:25:01,643
I know you are, Tom,
and I know you love her.

464
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,643
Why else do you think

465
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:06,076
I'm willing to put up
with all this for six months?

466
00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:08,276
Why do you think I'm willing
to say to my college roommates,

467
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:10,009
"Yes, that's my husband's
love child and her mother

468
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,509
in our Christmas picture"?

469
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,842
Because I am your wife!

470
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:16,009
You always come first
with me.

471
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:21,643
Do I still come first
with you?

472
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:31,376
I guess I'll see you later,
Nora.

473
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:33,710
Well... I'm taking Kayla.

474
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,209
Well, that's a shame.

475
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:39,376
I've gotta go hoist
a piñata.

476
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,676
Mommy, they have a piñata.

477
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,309
Fine!

478
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,809
I'll be back at 7:00.

479
00:25:54,842 --> 00:25:57,543
But there had better be
a corner piece of cake

480
00:25:57,576 --> 00:25:59,076
waiting for me.

481
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,976
Come on, Kayla.
Go--go have some fun.

482
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,576
Go have some...

483
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:13,842
Thank you for that.

484
00:26:13,875 --> 00:26:15,710
Sure.

485
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,710
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

486
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,509
Gonna go buy a piñata?

487
00:26:19,543 --> 00:26:21,142
I sure am.

488
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,365
Xiao-mei?

489
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:26,766
Come on out!
I have your lunch.

490
00:26:28,699 --> 00:26:32,265
Xiao-mei,
your favorite soap is on.

491
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,265
There's a doctor
fondling a patient

492
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:35,766
on the operating table.

493
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:38,832
You're missing it! Xiao-mei?

494
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,866
<i><font color=#ff0000><i>(man on TV)</i></font>
Oh, I'll have to examine you.</i>

495
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,632
<i><font color=#ff0000><i>(woman)</i></font> Oh, again?</i>

496
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,566
Xiao-mei?

497
00:26:58,732 --> 00:27:00,198
Hey, quick question.

498
00:27:00,232 --> 00:27:04,632
Have you, by any chance,
seen Xiao-mei?

499
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,699
I can't believe
you lost our baby.

500
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:08,899
I did not lose our baby.
Stop saying that.

501
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:11,832
I know exactly where it is--
inside some crazy Chinese woman

502
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,699
who also stole
half a chicken from my fridge.

503
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,732
<font color=#ff0000><i>(all speaking loudly
in Chinese)</i></font>

504
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:24,132
Hi! Hi.

505
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:27,432
Liang, right?
Remember me?

506
00:27:27,465 --> 00:27:29,899
Xiao-mei lives with me.
You came over. We had lunch.

507
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,566
You got some nerve showing
your face here. Get out.

508
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:34,566
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!

509
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,966
Uh, what happened to that
famous Chinese hospitality?

510
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,532
Xiao-mei called me.

511
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:41,399
She said you threatened
to send her back to china

512
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:44,332
to work as a slave
in a rice paddy.

513
00:27:44,365 --> 00:27:47,666
I... I may have mentioned
deportation,

514
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,165
but I didn't think
she'd take it personally.

515
00:27:50,198 --> 00:27:52,732
Are you crazy?
It was banter.

516
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:54,432
I mean, has this country

517
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:57,365
come to the point where you
can't joke with the help?

518
00:27:57,399 --> 00:27:59,532
You treat Xiao-mei
like dirt.

519
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:01,532
She's just
a poor, innocent girl

520
00:28:01,566 --> 00:28:03,532
trying to live
the American dream,

521
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:05,532
just like your ancestors.

522
00:28:05,566 --> 00:28:08,232
Oh, don't give me
that "we are the world" crap.

523
00:28:08,265 --> 00:28:10,799
That woman's uterus is
harboring a stolen baby.

524
00:28:10,832 --> 00:28:13,098
So if you know where she is,
you better start talking,

525
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:15,432
or else I'm gonna get
the health department down here

526
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:18,966
and take a closer look at what
you're serving as Mu shu pork.

527
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:28,098
Boy, those people just don't
have a sense of humor, do they?

528
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:29,599
I'm telling you,

529
00:28:29,632 --> 00:28:31,599
at this number,
it's not gonna last long.

530
00:28:31,632 --> 00:28:33,465
Well, we like the neighborhood,

531
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:35,465
but we've heard
that some odd things

532
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:37,899
have gone on with this house.
Complete fabrication.

533
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:39,899
Malicious lies spread
by jealous competitors.

534
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,966
Now you've gotta check out
this storage.

535
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:45,265
You're not gonna believe
what you can fit in here.

536
00:28:49,198 --> 00:28:52,332
And now the media room.

537
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:55,198
Wow, you certainly devoured
that ice cream.

538
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,198
Can I get you anything else?

539
00:28:57,232 --> 00:28:58,699
You tell me.

540
00:28:58,732 --> 00:28:59,866
Hmm.

541
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:00,866
Orson...

542
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,699
Mmm.

543
00:29:02,732 --> 00:29:05,198
Mmm. Mmm.

544
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:06,666
I thought we...

545
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:07,966
Orson.

546
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:10,432
Mm? Oh, I just assumed
now that we're engaged...

547
00:29:10,465 --> 00:29:12,866
Well, does that change
our core values?

548
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:16,699
No. But when I saw you standing
in front of the freezer

549
00:29:16,732 --> 00:29:19,198
with a clingy silk dress,
let's just say,

550
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,699
well, that challenged them.

551
00:29:20,732 --> 00:29:22,699
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font>
Well, I thought we agreed

552
00:29:22,732 --> 00:29:25,198
we wanted our wedding night
to be perfect.

553
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:27,732
Yes, but actors want
opening night to be perfect.

554
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,232
That's why they rehearse.

555
00:29:29,265 --> 00:29:33,065
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font>
It'll be better this way.

556
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:36,198
Now... can I get you
some more ice cream?

557
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,265
Not in that dress.

558
00:29:53,832 --> 00:29:55,299
Hi.

559
00:30:03,365 --> 00:30:06,999
So I need to ask you
something.

560
00:30:07,033 --> 00:30:10,933
Ian, you know,
from across the hall--

561
00:30:10,966 --> 00:30:13,933
You met him.

562
00:30:13,966 --> 00:30:19,866
Anyway... he sort of
asked me out...

563
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:22,933
on a date.

564
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:25,432
I know you're thrown.

565
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,265
I was thrown, too.

566
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,599
But he's really nice,
and...

567
00:30:31,966 --> 00:30:35,165
I could sort of use someone
to talk to...

568
00:30:37,732 --> 00:30:40,365
who also talks back.

569
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,399
the thing is...

570
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:51,766
I'm sort of lonely...

571
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,432
and the past six months
have been really hard on me.

572
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,399
So what I need is...

573
00:31:01,265 --> 00:31:03,732
I need to know
that it's okay with you

574
00:31:03,766 --> 00:31:06,399
if I go out with him.

575
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,832
Because if it's not,
I won't.

576
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:14,332
In fact, I'd like nothing
better than for you

577
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:16,332
to just wake up right now

578
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:18,799
and tell me
not to go out with him.

579
00:31:18,832 --> 00:31:22,399
Just wake up and tell me.
Wake up. Please!

580
00:31:28,599 --> 00:31:31,999
All right.

581
00:31:32,033 --> 00:31:34,632
<font color=#ff0000><i>(sighs)</i></font>

582
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,432
I'll see you tomorrow.

583
00:31:38,165 --> 00:31:39,866
I love you.

584
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,732
It is really just dinner.

585
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,020
I'm just dropping off
Carlos,

586
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,053
and then I'll be by
to pick her up.

587
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:08,120
Okay, thanks, Edie.

588
00:32:08,153 --> 00:32:10,920
Xiao-mei's fine. Crisis averted.
No harm, no foul.

589
00:32:10,953 --> 00:32:12,920
How can you say that?

590
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:15,553
You endangered the life
of our baby today.

591
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:17,553
Don't you dare give me
that attitude.

592
00:32:17,586 --> 00:32:19,786
You have no idea what
I've been going through

593
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,354
these past six months.

594
00:32:21,386 --> 00:32:22,953
<font color=#ff0000><i>(sighs)</i></font> Here we go.

595
00:32:22,987 --> 00:32:25,354
I have had to wait
hand and foot on your mistress.

596
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:26,920
I mean, imagine if

597
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:29,053
the day after you found out
about John Rowland,

598
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:31,020
you had to make his lunch
and rub his feet.

599
00:32:31,053 --> 00:32:33,519
Yeah, well, John Rowland
wasn't carrying our kid.

600
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:36,686
Forgive me for being concerned
about our surrogate.

601
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,519
Xiao-mei
is going to be fine.

602
00:32:39,553 --> 00:32:42,120
Once that baby comes,
her slate is wiped clean.

603
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,620
She's gonna walk away,

604
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:46,320
go off and live
<i>her</i> American dream.

605
00:32:46,354 --> 00:32:48,220
Me? I'm gonna be stuck,
a single mother

606
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:49,920
raising a child alone,

607
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:53,120
haggling with lawyers on
who gets the kid at Christmas.

608
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:58,453
My American dream
is officially dead.

609
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:03,987
I'm sorry.

610
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,887
Thank you.

611
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,220
But just so you know,
my dream hasn't exactly--

612
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:12,786
<font color=#ff0000><i>(tires screech, engine roars)</i></font>

613
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,987
Okay, so we will see you
Saturday,

614
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:24,820
and please pretend
to be surprised. Bye.

615
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:26,320
You told someone else?

616
00:33:26,354 --> 00:33:28,820
Bree, I thought
the whole point of the party

617
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,753
was to announce
our engagement.

618
00:33:30,786 --> 00:33:34,087
I just can't help it.
I like telling people.

619
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,153
Makes me feel...
I don't know.

620
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:38,686
makes me feel like
I'm starting over.

621
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,187
It feels good.

622
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,187
Feels good to me, too,
though.

623
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,187
Hmm.

624
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,419
<font color=#ff0000><i>(chuckles)</i></font>

625
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:46,786
Ah, no hands. See?
Ahem.

626
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,419
Hmm.

627
00:33:50,053 --> 00:33:51,187
Hmm.

628
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,786
Oh, you don't have
to wash those.

629
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,287
I already did that.

630
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,287
Oh, I found some streaks,

631
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,686
so I'm wiping them down
with undiluted red wine vinegar.

632
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,853
I've never heard of that.

633
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:05,519
Oh, sure.

634
00:34:05,553 --> 00:34:08,187
For tougher spots,
I use a 50-50 mix

635
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,254
of denatured alcohol
and water.

636
00:34:10,287 --> 00:34:12,686
Ah.

637
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,287
And for those really
intractable stains--

638
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,720
I mean, we're talking
shower doors--

639
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:22,220
I wipe on lacquer thinner
with a towel.

640
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,620
Bree?

641
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:30,620
<font color=#ff0000><i>(gasps)</i></font>

642
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,653

643
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:39,620
<font color=#ff0000><i>(moaning continues)</i></font>

644
00:34:39,653 --> 00:34:41,753
Oh, Orson.

645
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,153
Ohh!

646
00:34:45,187 --> 00:34:47,053
<font color=#ff0000><i>(grunting)</i></font>

647

<font color=#ff0000><i>(groaning)</i></font>

649
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:57,020
Uh... excuse me.

650
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,354
Hmm?

651
00:34:58,386 --> 00:35:00,519
Did you lose something?

652
00:35:00,553 --> 00:35:04,653
<i>No. I just thought...
for you...</i>

653
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,686
Oh! Um, I don't do that.

654
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,020
Why not?

655
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:11,519
I'm a republican.

656
00:35:11,553 --> 00:35:13,020
I'm a libertarian.

657
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:15,519
I believe in minimizing
the role of the state

658
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:17,853
and maximizing
individual rights.

659
00:35:17,887 --> 00:35:20,553
But, Orson!

660
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:24,220
Trust me.
I know what I'm doing.

661
00:35:24,254 --> 00:35:25,987
Okay.

662
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:42,720
Aah! Oh, no!

663
00:35:42,753 --> 00:35:46,020
What, you didn't just crack
that veneer again, did you?

664
00:35:46,053 --> 00:35:48,254
I have to go.

665
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:51,586
Go? Go where?

666
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,187
And then it was like
something inside ruptured.

667
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,987
Well, not so much a rupture
as a spasm.

668
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,153
Waves of
this hot clutching.

669
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:03,653
I think I might have had
a small stroke.

670
00:36:03,686 --> 00:36:05,620
How severe were the pains?

671
00:36:05,653 --> 00:36:07,519
Well, that's the odd thing.

672
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:09,519
I mean, there was no pain
per se.

673
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:12,053
In fact,
it wasn't entirely unpleasant.

674
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,120
What were you doing
at the time?

675
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:18,354
I was, uh, with my fiancé.

676
00:36:18,386 --> 00:36:22,354
We were lying down...
resting.

677
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:24,354
I'm gonna take
a wild swing here.

678
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:26,287
Were you having sex?

679
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,320
Sort of.

680
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,220
Ms. Van De Kamp, I think
you may have had an orgasm.

681
00:36:33,254 --> 00:36:36,220
No, no, no.
I had orgasms before.

682
00:36:36,254 --> 00:36:37,920
Mm, how would you
describe them?

683
00:36:37,953 --> 00:36:39,920
Oh, you know,
that warm sensation,

684
00:36:39,953 --> 00:36:42,453
that tingling feeling
of relief when it's over.

685
00:36:42,486 --> 00:36:45,020
No, no, this was much...

686
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,486
Better?

687
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:47,553
Yes.

688
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:51,887
That's 'cause
it was an orgasm.

689
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,987
Oh.

690
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,653
Well, I'll be darned.

691
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:32,302
Hi. Can I help you?

692
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:35,069
Are you Bree Van De Kamp?

693
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:36,435
Yes, and you are?

694
00:37:36,469 --> 00:37:40,236
Carolyn Bigsby.
I was Orson’s neighbor.

695
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,803
Oh, well, come on in.

696
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:44,302
Let's dry you off
and get you a drink.

697
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:49,302
I didn't come here
to celebrate.

698
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,903
Carolyn.

699
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:53,736
Engaged again?
That was quick work.

700
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:58,203
Does she know
you killed your wife?

701
00:38:00,136 --> 00:38:04,402
My wife <i>left</i> me.

702
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:06,236
And no one ever heard
from her again.

703
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,236
Not me, not her family.

704
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,469
Just dropped off
the face of the earth.

705
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:17,836
Orson, what is she
talking about?

706
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:19,736
Didn't tell you that part,
did he?

707
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:22,469
All right, Carolyn,
you've made your little scene.

708
00:38:22,502 --> 00:38:26,502
You keep your hands off me.
Don't let him fool you.

709
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,502
Get away from him now
while you can.

710
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,435
Please leave my house.

711
00:38:34,469 --> 00:38:39,103
Fine. Be a fool.
Marry him.

712
00:38:39,136 --> 00:38:41,636
Just don't be surprised
when you go missing, too.

713
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:03,702
I'm sorry you had
to endure that.

714
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:10,936
Your wife...

715
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,302
disappeared?

716
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:16,103
I tried to find her.

717
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:19,936
Her family claimed
not to have heard from her.

718
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:23,669
Personally, I think she was
just trying to punish me.

719
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,636
So...

720
00:39:26,669 --> 00:39:28,369
are you still married?

721
00:39:28,402 --> 00:39:32,236
No, I was granted a divorce
on grounds of abandonment.

722
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:36,369
Bree...

723
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,170
you can't possibly
think that--

724
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:42,335
No, of course not.

725
00:39:44,302 --> 00:39:48,103
I love you.

726
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,502
And I love you.

727
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:56,335
Orson...

728
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:57,936
My hand.

729
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,170
<font color=#ff0000><i>(speaking indistinctly)</i></font>

730
00:40:24,736 --> 00:40:27,369
The buffet is open.

731
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:29,769
Bree...

732
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:00,136
<i>Every storm

733
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,369

00:41:02,402 --> 00:41:05,502
<i>everything
will be made clean again,</i>

735
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,936
<i>and even
the most troubling stains</i>

736
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,435
<i>will have disappeared,</i>

737
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:14,203
<i>like the doubts
over his innocence...</i>

738
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:20,236
<i>or the consequence
of his mistake.</i>

739
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:28,302
<i>Like the scars
of his betrayal...</i>

740
00:41:33,369 --> 00:41:37,170
<i>or the memory of his kiss.</i>

741
00:41:40,636 --> 00:41:43,769
<i>So we wait for the storm
to pass,</i>

742
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:46,335
<i>hoping for the best.</i>

00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,240
