泰德  马上你会被一群

全身抹油的半裸体包围着

我说的油  是指汽车润滑油

38
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,770
我们为什么还坐在这儿
Why are we still sitting here?

39
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,100

今晚就不折腾了

我想象不出来这种可能性
I can't imagine a world where that's possible.

44
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,930
我是认真的
I'm serious.

45
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,270
二十年后
20 years from now,

46
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,740
我第三任26岁的妻子问我这场比赛
when my 26-year-old third wife asks me about this...

47
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,820
这种玩笑你开得太多了
You make a lot of those jokes.

48
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,460
我会说
I'm gonna say,

49
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,440
"太精彩了  但你知道最搞笑的是什么吗
"Yeah, it was awesome, but you know the funny thing?

50
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,860
泰德差点就没去"

51
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,220
"但是感谢上帝他去了  那晚太精彩了"
"But thank God he did, because it was a great night."

52
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,320
然后我们会转战到按摩浴缸
And then she and I will adjourn to the Jacuzzi,

53
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,260
我的第四任妻子在那里等我们
where my fourth wife will be waiting for us,

54
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,990
她已经在喷水口那里自嗨了
already warming herself up on the jets.

55
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,690
罗宾来了  剩下的等会再说
Oh, Robin's here-- I'll tell you the rest later.

56
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,320
记得要说  这故事有无限可能
Please do, that story could go anywhere.

57
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,500
我们又到酒吧来了
Here we are at the bar once more.

58
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,180
你们会问"我们该喝什么呢"
"What will I have to drink?" You ask.

59
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,680
明尼苏达海啸
Minnesota Tidal Wave.

60
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,030
你们会问"那是什么玩意"
"What's that?" You ask.

61
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,470
史上最好喝的鸡尾酒
Only the best cocktail ever.

62
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,460
你们再问"是谁发明的"
"Who invented it?" You ask.

63
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,210
我
Me.

64
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,520
这可不是女性饮品
And it's not a girly drink.

65
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,430
莉莉  你干嘛说那几个字
Lily, why would you even say that?

66
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,420
女性饮品
Girly drink.

67
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,920
我世界上最不女人的女人
Hey, I am the least girly girl on Earth,

68
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,570
我就很喜欢明尼苏达海啸
and I love the Minnesota Tidal Wave.

69
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,260
谢谢  罗宾
Thank you, Robin.

70
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,620
实际上  我要去点一杯
Matter of fact, I'm going to go order one

71
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,060
并且要昂首挺胸地走过去
right now with my head held high.

72
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,050
-莉莉  -你想让我帮你点吗
- Lily. - You want me to order it for you?

73
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,970
是的  谢谢宝贝
Yes, please, thank you, baby.

74
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,530
泰德  我告诉你生活的秘诀是什么
Ted, let me tell you the secret to life.

75
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,610
每次我要决定
Every time I make a decision

76
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,540
要在某个夜晚干点什么时  我就问自己
about what to do on a given night, I ask myself,

77
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,790
"干什么会变成二十年后最美好的记忆"
"What would make the best memory 20 years from now?"

78
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,110
所以我让二十年后的巴尼替我决定
So I let 20-Years-From-Now- Barney call the shots.

79
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,370
每次都能奏效
And it always works out.

80
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,610
二十年后的巴尼
And 20-Years-From-Now-Barney

81
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,000
认为我们应该去看机器人大战摔跤手
thinks we should go to Robots vs. Wrestlers?

82
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,840
我不知道  问问他吧
I don't know. Let's ask him.

83
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,540
闭上眼睛  泰德
Close your eyes, Ted.

84
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,590
好  现在睁开
Okay, now open them.

85
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,520
巴尼  我发誓
Barney, I swear to God,

86
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,220
如果我睁开眼睛看见你的光腚
if I open my eyes and your bare ass

87
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,620
又紧贴着我的脸
is an inch away from my face again...

88
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,640
快睁开眼
Just open your eyes.

89
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,070
泰德  这是二十年后的巴尼
Ted, I'd like you to meet 20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

90
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,940
二十年后的巴尼  你记得泰德吧
20-Years-From-Now-Barney, you remember Ted.

91
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,300
你好啊
'Sup?

92
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,380
泰德
Hey, Ted.

93
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,870
我听说并记得
What's this I hear-slash-remember

94
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,610
你不想去看机器人大战摔跤手  是吗
about you not wanting to see Robots vs. Wrestlers?

95
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,380
是的  我就是不想去而已
Yeah, it's just that I don't want to see it.

96
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,940
-你不...  -我知道
- You don't... - I know.

97
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,220
-他不...  -我知道

泰德  相信我们  这将是一场传...
Ted, trust us, it's gonna be legend--

99
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,570
再等个20年
wait 20 years for it...

100
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,870
奇

101
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,700
-传奇  -传奇
- Legendary! - Legendary!

102
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,980
好了  我要回家了
Okay, uh, I'm gonna go home.

103
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,990
-听着  泰德  -别走
- No, Ted, look. - Come on!

104
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,480
如果你不相信机器人大战摔跤手
If you don't believe that robots vs. Wrestlers

105
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,020
将会是你人生的转折点
is gonna be a life-changing event,

106
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:37,100
或许你会相信二十年后的泰德
maybe you'll believe 20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

107
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,740
你好啊
'Sup?

108
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,490
突然要消化这么多东西
Wow, so many things all at once.

109
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,170
但是最重要的是
But most importantly...

110
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,730
我居然没有秃顶
I don't go bald?

111
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,970
没
Nope.

112
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,070
我也没秃
And neither do I.

113
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,040
泰德  听我说
Ted, listen to me.

114
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,500
你  听你说
You, listen to you.

115
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,130
也就是我
Me.

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,550
你必须去看机器人大战摔跤手之传奇大战
You got to go to Robots vs. Wrestlers: Legends.

117
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,610
相信我  不去看的话你会后悔的
Trust me, you will regret it if you don't.

118
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,370
到底是什么  我会秃顶还是怎样
So, what, do I go bald or something?

119
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,720
那是假发吗
Is that a toupee?

120
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,290
-泰德  检查头皮  -不能叫罗宾吗
- Ted, scalp check! - Can't Robin do this?

121
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,390
快点  你都给我检查好几年了
Come on, you've been doing it for years.

122
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,480
你知道参比依据
You know the frame of reference.

123
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,930
头皮检查
Scalp check!

124
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,790
真稀奇
Hmm, that's odd.

125
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,260
这周检查头皮的时间略早啊
Little early in the week for scalp check.

126
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,510
5大汤匙糖
Five tablespoons of sugar,

127
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,480
再一点点香草伏特加
a whisper of vanilla vodka

128
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
就大功告成了
and you're done.

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,820
酒浸樱桃
Maraschino cherries.

130
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,650
最后在上面加点酒浸樱桃
Oh, and a handful of maraschino cherries on top.

131
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,430
等一下  你们点的是罗宾・特布罗斯基
Wait, you're ordering a Robin Scherbatsky.

132
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,120
干嘛不直接说
Why didn't you just say that?

133
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,990
等等  酒吧老板
One second there, barkeep.

134
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,200
我要是没记错的话
Unless I'm mistaken,

135
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,530
这位女士刚刚点的是
the drink this lady just ordered

136
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,450
明尼苏达海啸
is called the Minnesota Tidal Wave.

137
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,970
发明人未知
Origin unknown.

138
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,570
罗宾最近总是点这种酒
Oh, well, you know, Robin's been ordering them so much lately

139
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,910
所以我们以她的名字命名了
that we named it after her.

140
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,800
你们用我的名字做酒名
You named a drink after me?

141
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,520
菜单上写着呢
Right there in the menu.

142
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,990
恭喜
Congrats.

143
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,270
鸡尾酒
罗宾・特布罗斯基
肖恩・惠勒
蔻可拉舒尔

144
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,460
我喝不下去了
I can't drink this.

145
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,960
这样好点  我还是很火大
That's better. I'm still seething,

146
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,940
不过这样好点
but that's better.

147
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,630
好吧  二十年后的我
Okay, 20-Years-From-Now-Me,

148
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,180
和我说实话
level with me.

149
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,620
你们  我们
You. Us.

150
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,880
"机器人大战摔跤手"值得看吗
Is Robots vs. Wrestlers worth it?

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,480
那是我此生最棒的一晚
It was the single greatest night of my life.

152
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,930
甚至比你婚礼那天还棒吗
Even greater than your wedding?

153
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,000
不  等真到了我结婚那天
Well, I mean, when I get married,

154
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,870
那肯定是我此生最棒的一晚
that'll be the greatest night of my life.

155
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,440
不过谁知道我会不会结婚呢
But who knows when that's going to happen?

156
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
天啊  你还没...
Oh, my God, you still haven't...

157
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,010
我希望早日与她邂逅
Man, I hope I meet her soon.

158
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,780
天啊  我到底怎么了
Oh, God, what is wrong with me?!

159
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,290
抱歉
I'm sorry!

160
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,940
我逗你玩呢
I'm just messing with you!

161
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,580
快决定  是去还是不去
Now, come on, are we going or what?

162
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,080
行  走吧
Fine, let's go.

163
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,440
别着急啊
Not so fast.

164
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,990
巴尼  泰德  二十年后的巴尼
Barney, Ted, 20-Years-From-Now-Barney,

165
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,120
二十年后的泰德
20-Years-From-Now-Ted.

166
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,230
你是谁
Who are you?

167
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,870
我是二十小时后的泰德
I'm 20-Hours-From-Now-Ted.

168
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,620
你们这群混蛋哪也不准去
And you bastards aren't going anywhere.

169
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,060
你是二十小时后的泰德
So, you're the Ted from 20 hours from now?

170
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,440
你没事吧
You okay?

171
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,520
我有事
No, I'm not okay.

172
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,080
这蠢货要去看"机器人大战摔跤手"
This dummy's about to go to Robots vs. Wrestlers--

173
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,770
没错  那绝对会精彩绝伦
and yes, it'll be awesome...

174
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,090
看到没
See?

175
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,590
一开始精彩
...at first.

176
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,670
但很快你就会饮酒过多
But then you're gonna drink way too much,

177
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,730
然后就会头疼
hence the headache.

178
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,090
再然后你就会跳上拳击场
Then you're gonna jump into the ring

179
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,150
扭伤你的手腕  所以手腕有夹板
and sprain your wrist, hence the splint.

180
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,500
再之后  
And then afterwards,

181
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,830
你就会抽半包香烟  于是...
you're gonna smoke half a pack of cigarettes, hence the...

182
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,290
听起来挺不错的嘛
Well, that's the sound a good time.

183
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,040
二十小时后  当你变成我的时候
And 20 hours from now, when you're me,

184
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,330
你会想回到这里
you're gonna want to come back here,

185
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,710
回到这个卡座前  回到这一分钟
right to this very spot, right now,

186
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,450
狠狠地扇自己一耳光
and smack yourself upside the head.

187
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,870
但显然我不会那么做
Yeah, but obviously I wouldn't do that

188
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,170
因为想让扇自己除非...
'cause I'd only be smacking myself--

189
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,560
别这么对我  泰德  别这样对我们
Don't do this to me, Ted. Don't do this to us.

190
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,760
别听你的  现在的泰德
Don't listen to yourself, Present-Day-Ted.

191
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,970
这是一辈子都值得回味的一天
It's a day of pain for a lifetime of memories.

192
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,460
二十小时后的我
20-Hours-From-Now-Me,

193
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,400
告诉我一件事  我吐了吗
just tell me one thing: do I hurl?

194
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,990
吐了  孩子
Yeah, kid.

195
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,570
你吐了
You hurl.

196
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,070
吐得很厉害吗
A lot?

197
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,370
还记得妈妈
Remember when Mom

198
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,930
从特价店买回来的变质牛肉吗
bought the beef from the Price Club?

199
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,060
好吧  这样行不行
Okay, how about this:

200
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,710
我们去看机器人大战摔跤手
we go to Robots vs. Wrestlers,

201
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,910
但我不会过多饮酒
but I don't drink too much?

202
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,310
有意思
Interesting.

203
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:01,980
我同意
I'm good with that.

204
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,570
不  算了吧
No, forget it.

205
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,820
如果泰德不喝醉
If Ted doesn't get wasted,

206
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,480
他最后根本不可能
there's no way he'll end up making out

207
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,320
和超真实的女机器人亲热
with that surprisingly realistic-looking female robot.

208
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,060
等等  我亲了女机器人吗
Wait, I kiss a female robot?

209
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,770
你可不止亲亲哦
Oh, you do a lot more than that.

210
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,780
没人说非得喝酒
Now, look, nobody is saying you need alcohol

211
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,250
才能度过一个激动难忘的夜晚
to have an exciting and memorable night.

212
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,960
-那是  -当然
- Absolutely not. - Absolutely not.

213
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,080
不过这件事情  你是必须先喝醉
But in this case, yeah, you kind of have to be wasted.

214
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,630
你还得喝一大桶啤酒
You drink beers in cans still.

215
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,780
这会机器人看起来更恐怖
It makes the robot scarier.

216
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,030
他们居然以她命名我的酒
They named my drink after her.

217
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,090
明尼苏达海啸
The Minnesota Tidal Wave.

218
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,950
那是我常喝的酒
It's my usual.

219
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,220
这无关紧要
Immaterial!

220
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,910
如果这酒要以一个人的名字命名
If it's gonna be named after anybody,

221
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,570
那应该叫"马修・埃里克森"
it should be called The Marshall Eriksen.

222
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,970
抱歉  事实是"罗宾・特布罗斯基"
Sorry, it's The Robin Scherbatsky.

223
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,310
接受事实  一边哭去吧
Read it and weep.

224
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,190
那你是要偷我的创意吗
Oh, so you're gonna Zuckerberg me?

225
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:43,990
是吗
That it?

226
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,220
偷窃我的创意
You're Zuckerberging me?

227
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,170
好吧
That's fine.

228
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,650
法庭上见
I'll see you in court.

229
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,430
称之为"舞池"的小法庭
Little court known as the dance floor.

230
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,380
舞蹈对决  现在
Dance-off. Now.

231
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,860
不  不要跳舞
No, no dancing.

232
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,650
马修  我们已经说好了
Marshall, we've been through this.

233
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,140
医生说你屁股的状况相当糟糕
The doctor said your dancer's hip is worse than ever.

234
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,740
你得休息一阵子别扭了
You have to lay off dancing for a while.

235
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,720
你这不是要我的命吗  莉莉
You're killing me, Lily!

236
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,290
你是要我的命啊
You're killing me!

237
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,510
我是个成年人
I'm an adult.

238
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,180
我要以舞赢得我的尊严之战
You have to let me dance my own battles.

239
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,270
马修  不用什么舞蹈对决
Marshall, there's not gonna be a dance-off

240
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,630
因为酒名已经定了
because the name is staying.

241
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,940
就这样  问题解决
Period, end of story.

242
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,960
我就喜欢我的名字被写在上面
I just like having my name on something.

243
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,490
是吗
Oh, you do?

244
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,150
很好  罗宾
Oh, that's great, Robin.

245
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,080
你会心想事成
Then that's what you will get.

246
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,910
你会
That's...

247
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,060
心想
what you...

248
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,970
事成
will get.

249
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,950
两分钟后

250
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,440
罗宾
Oh, hey, Robin.

251
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,120
知道什么是《激情热线》吗
You here "For a good time"?

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,120
《For a Good Time, Call... 》喜剧电影

253
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,330
经典之作
Classic.

254
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,150
你是把我的电话号码写在男厕里吗
Did you write my number in the men's room?

255
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,270
那个  我不知道
It... Well, I don't know.

256
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,720
除非你进去  不然你绝不会知道
I guess you'll never know unless you go in there,

257
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,950
我肯定你不敢...
which I highly doubt that...

258
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,820
她进去了
There she goes.

259
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,940
小伙子们
Okay, boys.

260
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,100
闭上眼睛  关上鸟笼
Close your eyes and zip your flies.

261
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,570
当我不存在
Hi. Don't mind me.

262
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,430
想激情一下吗
请致电罗宾・特布罗斯基

263
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,470
你不应该那么做的
I don't think you should have done that.

264
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,470
莉莉  我知道我在做什么
Lily, I know what I'm doing, all right?

265
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,380
我是一名律师
I'm a lawyer.

266
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,190
我已经预想过各种状况了
I've thought about every possible scenario.

267
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,400
我已经遥遥领先于...
I'm ten steps ahead of...

268
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,020
她要去哪里
Where's she going?

269
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,290
大概是去女厕
Probably into the ladies' room

270
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,490
在墙上乱写点你的什么吧
to write something on the wall about you.

271
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,240
女厕的墙上
Nobody writes things

272
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,650
才没有人乱涂乱画呢
on the walls of the ladies' room.

273
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,220
你去过女厕吗
Have you been in the ladies' room?

274
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,850
当然没去过
Of course not.

275
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,670
莉莉  在下虽然具备坏男孩的各种性感魅力
Lily, I know that I have the sexual charisma of a bad boy,

276
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,220
但我绝对没有他们的不良习气
but I certainly don't have the manners of one.

277
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,990
你在里面写了什么
What'd you write in there?

278
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,550
你何不自己进去看一看呢
Why don't you go in and look?

279
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,960
你明知道我做不出这种事  罗宾
You know I can't do that, Robin.

280
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,940
莉莉  帮我进去看一看吧
Lily, can you go look?

281
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,650
我记得你不是想要独舞迎战吗
Oh, I thought you wanted to dance your own battles.

282
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,810
各位女士  把裙子都穿上了
Ladies, put your blouses back on!

283
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,470
在下要进来了
I'm coming in!

284
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,900
亲爱的马修
Dear Marshall,

285
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,300
我知道这种道歉方式实在很奇怪
I know this is a strange way to apologize,

286
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,450
但抱歉卡尔用我名字命名你的酒
but I'm sorry I let Carl name your drink after me.

287
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,460
我为什么当时不反对呢
Why didn't I say something?

288
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,790
这大概得追溯到我的悲惨童年
Gosh, I guess that goes back to my childhood.

289
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,770
好了各位
Okay, guys.

290
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,100
我们去看机器人大战摔跤手吧
Let's go to Robots vs. Wrestlers.

291
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,540
太好了  你总算想明白了
Huzzah! Now you're talking!

292
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,140
-走吧  -不  都给我坐好
- Here we go. - Nope, sit down.

293
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,650
统统给我坐好
Everybody sit down.

294
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,930
你是哪位啊
Okay, who are you?

295
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,020
泰德  巴尼  二十小时后的泰德
Hello, Ted, Barney, 20-Hours-From-Now-Ted,

296
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,110
二十年后的泰德  二十年后的巴尼  你们好
20-Years-From-Now-Ted, 20-Years-From-Now-Barney.

297
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,850
最近过得怎么样
Hey, how's it going?

298
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,700
容我自我介绍一下
Allow me to introduce myself.

299
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,800
我是二十分钟后的巴尼
I'm 20-Minutes-From-Now-Barney,

300
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,420
我有非常重要的事要...
and I have got something very important to...

301
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,360
你衣服上的污渍是怎么回事  老兄
What's the stain on your shirt, bro?

302
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,410
拜托  拜托  
Please, please,

303
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,450
我真的有非常重要的事 
I really do have something very important to...

304
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,010
你看起来好蠢
You look stupid.

305
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,570
你的意大利面来了
Here's your spaghetti.

306
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,630
小心
And be careful...

307
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,990
那些肉丸子
...with the meatball.

308
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,270
那是我爸爸唯一一次
And that's the only time my father

309
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,380
说他为我而骄傲
ever said he was proud of me.

310
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,040
也许这就是为什么我抢走了你的酒名
Maybe that's why I stole credit for your drink.

311
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,880
也许这就是
Maybe that's why

312
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,520
我要用这种方式倾吐心声的原因
I needed to pour my heart out like this.

313
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,770
又或许我是为了让你在女厕多待一会
Or, maybe I wrote this so you'd be in here long enough

314
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,680
直到有女士进来  让你吓得躲进隔间里
for a lady to walk in, causing you to freak out

315
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,350
才写了这么多东西
and hide in the stall.

316
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,340
你收到了短信
So, you got a text message?

317
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,070
我说中了吧  
爱你的  罗宾  
罗宾・特布罗斯基鸡尾酒发明者

318
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,880
下次记得把饭往嘴里送
Try to get some in your mouth next time.

319
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,390
好了各位  听我说
Okay, everybody, listen up.

320
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,360
我刚进来的时候
When I walked in here,

321
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,930
我还是二十分钟之后的巴尼
I was 20-Minutes- From-Now-Barney.

322
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,430
但那是十九分钟前
But that was 19 minutes

323
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,210
"我现在有点倒胃反酸
and some serious acid reflux--

324
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,490
谁会在爱尔兰酒吧点意大利粉吃"的事了
who orders spaghetti at an Irish bar?-- ago.

325
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,280
现在我是二十秒之后的巴尼
Now, i'm 20-Seconds- From-Now-Barney,

326
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,790
我告诉你们  注意看那扇门
and I'm telling you, watch that door.

327
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,610
为什么
Why?

328
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,970
这就是为什么
That's why.

329
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,230
再等个十二秒左右
In-in, like, 12 seconds.

330
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,810
你的皮肤看起来真紧致
Your skin looks great.

331
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,950
谢谢
Thanks.

332
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,460
多亏了你一直注意保养
And thank you for taking such good care of it.

333
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,070
这就是为什么
That's why.

334
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,290
那是谁
Who is that?

335
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,720
她是在我们七年前去过的舞厅
She's the coat check girl

336
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,460
看衣帽间的姑娘
from that dance club we went to seven years ago.

337
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,350
你记得那个晚上吧
You remember that night.

338
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,950
巴尼和他表妹磨蹭了一晚上
When Barney grinded with his cousin.

339
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,400
拜托  都二十年了你还记得啊
Oh, man, you remember that 20 years from now?

340
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,980
他还生怕别人会忘记
He won't let anyone forget.

341
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,050
衣帽间的姑娘
Coat check girl.

342
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,600
我一直想回去那家俱乐部
I always meant to go back to that club

343
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,950
要她的电话号码  可我没有回去
and get her number, but I didn't.

344
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,330
而现在她出现在这里
And now she's here?

345
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,700
七年之后出现在这间酒吧里
She's in this bar seven years later?

346
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,790
我简直不敢相信
I-I can't believe this.

347
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,770
你们觉得我应该过去和她说话吗
So, wait, do you guys think I should go talk to her?

348
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:21,980
-你开玩笑呢  -当然快去
- Are you kidding me? - Yes, go...

349
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,290
-你要我说多少遍  -大笨蛋
- How many different ways... - Idiot.

350
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,150
你好
Hello?

351
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,240
请问有人在外面吗
Is anybody out there?

352
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,950
听起来外面没有人了
Sounds like the coast is clear.

353
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,540
别走  别走  等等
No, no, wait!

354
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,620
拜托  真不是我的错
Please, it's not my fault!

355
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,110
我是被人陷害的
I was tricked!

356
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,380
这样可不好  马修
Not cool, Marshall.

357
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,560
这是一间高级酒吧
This is a nice bar.

358
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,070
姑娘们上这里来  只是为了和朋友放松
Girls come here, they just want to relax with their friends,

359
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,430
喝上几杯罗宾・特布罗斯基
maybe have a few Robin Scherbatskys,

360
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,050
而不是提心吊胆
and not have to worry out some guy

361
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,400
害怕有人在厕所搞什么马修・埃瑞克森之举
pulling a Marshall Eriksen in the bathroom.

362
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,810
不  我知道  我只是
No, no, no, I know. I just...

363
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,580
等一下  你刚才是不是用我的名字
Wait a minute, did you just use my name

364
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,780
来指代变态行为了
as shorthand for a guy being creepy?

365
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,800
没错
Yep.

366
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,590
你知道吗  卡尔
Well, you know what, Carl?

367
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,130
我觉得你的行为
I think that you are making

368
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,100
是不分是非黑白乱扣帽子
a broad and prejudicial assumption.

369
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,240
所以下次我看到有人冒出来
So next time I meet a guy who just goes around

370
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,710
妄加评论的时候  我会说
rushing to judgment, I'm gonna say,

371
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,990
"哇  那家伙真是好卡尔..."
"Hey, that guy's being a real Carl..."

372
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,410
你不知道我姓什么是吧
You don't know my last name.

373
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,100
你在这里都喝了这么多年了
You've been drinking here for years,

374
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,950
居然还不知道我姓什么
and you don't know my last name.

375
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,100
只要你能说出来我的姓
I will name every drink in this bar after you

376
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,970
我就用你名字命名这里的每一种酒
if you can tell me my last name.

377
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,440
那也太容易搞混了
Well, that just seems confusing.

378
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,720
你怎么知道客人点的是哪一种酒呢
How will you know what people are ordering?

379
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,830
我到底姓什么  马修
What's my last name, Marshall?

380
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,010
你叫卡尔
It's Carl...

381
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,030
二世
...'s Junior.

382
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,050
祝我好运吧  各位
Okay, wish me luck, everyone.

383
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,430
马到成功
Break a leg...

384
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,030
怎么回事
What the hell?

385
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,200
不要和她说话
Do not talk to her.

386
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,630
怎么回事  你们是谁
What-what... Who are you?

387
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,310
我们是二十个月之后的衣帽间女孩
We are 20-Months-From-Now- Coat-Check-Girl.

388
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,330
可你们是两个人
But there's two of you.

389
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:10,560
没错  因为如果你走过和她聊天
Right, because if you go over there and you talk to her,

390
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,690
二十个月之后  就会出现我们两人中的一种结局
20 months from now, it's gonna end in one of two ways.

391
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,660
要不就是你厌烦了我
Either you are gonna get sick of me.

392
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,160
我给你做了马芬松饼
I made you muffins

393
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,160
因为你的中间名叫马芬
because of your nickname: Muffin.

394
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,000
或是
Or...

395
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,450
我开始厌倦你  和你的蠢习惯
I am gonna get sick of you and your stupid habits.

396
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,820
别再录新闻了  你永远追不上的
Stop DVR-ing the news. You're never gonna catch up.

397
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,030
别说了
Oh, stop it,

398
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,620
你把他吓坏了
you're scaring him off.

399
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,060
对了  我怀孕了
By the way, I'm pregnant.

400
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,030
她没有
No, she's not.

401
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,140
好吧  我没有
Okay, no, I'm not,

402
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,620
但至少让你开心了一秒钟  对吗
but that made you happy for a second, right?

403
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,330
-请闭嘴  -好了  等等
- Please shut up. - Okay, wait,

404
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,450
你是说命中注定没结果吗
so you're saying it's doomed completely?

405
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,050
我们之中肯定有人会厌倦对方
One of us is just guaranteed to get sick of the other

406
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,790
然后提出分手吗
and call it quits?

407
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,860
你约会过这么多女人  泰德
You've been dating for a long time, Ted.

408
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,180
有碰到过其它结果吗
Has it ever gone any other way?

409
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,120
看这个
Look at this one.

410
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,190
谢谢
Thank you so much.

411
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,480
你看起来有些郁闷啊
Hey. Hey, you look kind of down.

412
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,570
喝杯罗宾・特布罗斯基  我请
Have a Robin Scherbatsky, on me.

413
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,800
如果莉莉让我跳舞  根本不会有这种事
None of this would have happened if Lily had let me dance.

414
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,780
宝贝  等等
Baby, wait.

415
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,730
老天  你还在念叨这个吗
God, you're still clinging to that?

416
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,510
马修  没关系
Marshall, it doesn't matter,

417
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,780
就算斗舞你也会输  知道为什么吗
'cause you'd lose anyway, and you know why?

418
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,750
因为我是亮晶晶  贱人
'Cause I'm Sparkles, bitch.

419
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,980
你觉得你可以赢我吗
Oh, and you think you can step to me?

420
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,160
你觉得你可以舞出你人生
You think you can step up to the streets?

421
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,160
电影原名是Step Up 2: The Streets

422
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,150
赢过我吗
To me?

423
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,580
你觉得你可以赢过我  舞出你人生吗
You think you can step up over me to the streets?

424
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,820
我想我们永远不会知道  因为你不允许...
I guess we'll never know because you are not allowed...

425
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,570
等等
Wait, wait.

426
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,060
这是我的曲子
That's my jam.

427
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,450
谁在放我的曲子
Who's playing my jam?

428
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,510
-一舞决胜负  -谁怕你
- Dance-off.  - You're on.

429
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,030
我还是回家吧
I think I'm gonna head home.

430
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,410
我理解
I understand.

431
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,380
你不想阻止我吗
What, you're not gonna try and stop me?

432
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,500
我如何阻止你
And how would I try and stop you?

433
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,600
不知道  告诉我人生苦短
I don't know, by telling me life is short,

434
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,640
如果有机会碰到美丽
and if you ever come across a beautiful,

435
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,330
激动疯狂的时刻
exciting, crazy moment in it,

436
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,170
就得在那一刻消失之前
you got to seize it while you can

437
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,720
紧紧把握住
before that moment's gone?

438
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,320
泰德  这一刻早已结束了
Ted, this moment already is gone.

439
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,940
"明尼苏达海啸"
The whole Minnesota Tidal Wave thing

440
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,320
是五年前的事了
happened five years ago.

441
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,170
这些只是你的回忆
It's just a memory.

442
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,220
而其余的事情
And the rest of this

443
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,970
从未发生
never happened.

444
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,970
现在  马修和莉莉在楼上
Right now, Marshall and Lily are upstairs,

445
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,900
哄马文睡觉
trying to get Marvin to go back to sleep.

446
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,440
罗宾和我在选婚宴承办商
Robin and I are trying to decide on a caterer.

447
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,100
你整晚坐在这里
And you've been sitting here all night,

448
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,760
盯着一张机器人对战摔跤手的票
staring at a single ticket to Robots vs. Wrestlers

449
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,300
因为我们四个人没时间出来
because the rest of us couldn't come out.

450
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,480
看看周围  泰德
Look around, Ted.

451
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,560
你是孤身一人
You're all alone.

452
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,530
<i>孩子们  2013年4月那个寒冷的夜晚</i>
<i>Kids, it's been almost 20 years</i>

453
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,620
<i>已经过去二十年了</i>

454
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,170
<i>我可以肯定地告诉你们</i>

455
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,150
<i>如果我能回到过去  重新过那一晚</i>
<i>if I could go back in time and relive that night,</i>

456
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,290
<i>我绝对不会去看机器人对战摔跤手</i>
<i>there's no way in hell I'd go to Robots vs. Wrestlers.</i>

457
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,050
<i>不  我会回家</i>
<i>No, I'd go home.</i>

458
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,790
<i>我会去我的旧公寓</i>
<i>I'd go to my old apartment,</i>

459
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,970
<i>看看我的旧家具  所有的旧家当</i>
<i>see all my old furniture, my old stuff.</i>

460
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,720
<i>我会看看我的旧制图桌</i>
<i>I'd see my old drafting table,</i>

461
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,260
<i>我设计的第一栋大楼就是在上面画的</i>
<i>where I sketched out my first building.</i>

462
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,720
<i>我会坐在旧沙发上</i>
<i>I'd sit on that old couch</i>

463
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,390
<i>闻着三层楼下传来的印度菜香味</i>
<i>and smell the Indian food cooking three stories below.</i>

464
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,790
<i>我会去莉莉和马修的家</i>
<i>I'd go to Lily and Marshall's place,</i>

465
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,280
<i>回到那个有着无限美好记忆的客厅</i>
<i>be back in that old living room where so many things happened.</i>

466
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,810
<i>我会看看宝宝</i>
<i>I'd see the baby.</i>

467
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,270
<i>我不知道你们是否可以想象</i>
<i>I don't know if you can picture me holding</i>

468
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
<i>我把你们身高两米的马文大哥举过头顶</i>
<i>your six-foot-seven cousin Marvin over my head,</i>

469
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,300
<i>但当时我可以</i>
<i>but back then I could.</i>

470
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,550
<i>我会去找巴尼和罗宾喝一杯</i>
<i>I'd go have a drink with Barney and Robin,</i>

471
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,270
<i>看着他们为婚宴承办商吵架</i>
<i>watch them fight about their caterer</i>

472
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,300
<i>或是不管他们那晚吵什么</i>
<i>or whatever it was they were fighting about that night.</i>

473
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,780
<i>但这些都不是我想做的第一件事</i>
<i>But none of those things is the thing I'd do first.</i>

474
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,500
<i>你们知道我做的第一件事会是什么吗</i>
<i>You know the thing I'd do first?</i>

475
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,350

但现在我在这里
But I'm here now,

我想和你多在一起45天

488
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,890
即使没有这45天
Look, and if I can't have them,

489
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,080
我也要拥有被你男朋友冲我脸上来一拳
I'll take the 45 seconds before your boyfriend shows up

490
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,990
之前的45秒
and punches me in the face,

491
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,910
因为
