5
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,370
- 你不能打权杖钻石的主意 - 为什么不能?
- You can't nick the Crown Jewels. - Why not?

6
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,570
为什么?我会告诉你为什么不能
Why not?I'll tell you why not.

7
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,690
因为那是没有爱国心的开始
Because it's unpatriotic for a start.

8
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,570
另外,我可不能想像...
Besides which,I don't fancy being banged up...

9
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,890
在以后的300年内都被吊在伦敦塔上
in the Tower of London for the next 300 years.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,010
- 这一次,我觉得Danny或许讲到重点了 - 耶,谢谢,Stacie
- For once,I think Danny may have a point. - Yeah,thank you,Stacie.

11
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,480
你的"这一次"是什么意思?
What do you mean "for once"?

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,930
如果我们被抓住了 他们会把钥匙扔掉的,是不是?
If we get caught,they'll throw away the key,won't they?

13
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,210
完全正确.我真是迫不及待要去监狱了 睡都睡不着
Exactly.I'm too pretty to go to prison.I'll never get any sleep.

14
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,250
算我老派吧.但我会让大家避免被抓住的
Call me old-fashioned,but I was hoping to avoid getting caught.

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,530
我们在说的可是一场世纪的犯罪
We're talking about the crime of the century.

16
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,920
有一队私人收藏家愿意付出...
There's a band of private collectors who are willing to pay...

17
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,850
小小的金钱把非洲之星第一 加入到他们的收藏中
a small fortune to add the First Star of Africa to their collection.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,090
- 我们能找到他们吗? - 已经在进行中了
- Can we find them? - All in hand.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,650
非洲之星第一
The First Star of Africa.

20
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,050
530.2克拉.也被称为库利南1号...
530.2 carats.Also known as the Cullinan I...

21
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,370
1905年在南非发现的库利南钻石 被切割成9块后...
because it's the largest of the nine stones cut from the Cullinan diamond...

22
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,890
这是最大的一块,因此得名
discovered in South Africa in 1905.

23
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,770
现在被镶在英国国王的权杖上
It's now set in the head of the Royal Scepter.

24
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,930
无价之宝
It is priceless.

25
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,760
老家在伦敦塔里
Home is the Tower of London.

26
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,250
历史上只有一次对权杖钻石进行过偷窃
There has only ever been one attempt to steal the Crown Jewels.

27
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,210
是Colonel Blood在1671年偷的
And that was by Colonel Blood in 1671.

28
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,170
- 他怎么样了? - 失败
- What happened to him? - He failed.

29
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,850
很好,那我们要做什么?游过护城河还是去攀登碉堡?
Great,so what are we gonna do?Swim the moat or scale the battlements?

30
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,810
不需要.国王的权杖要被搬动了...
No need.The Royal Scepter's being moved...

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,090
给了我们一生唯一一次的机会
giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,490
它为什么会被搬动呢?
Why is it being moved?

33
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,650
现在皇家珠宝商正在对它进行清洗...
Right now it's being cleaned by the Royal Jewelers...

34
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,970
- 然后又会被搬动 - 去哪里?
- and after that it'll be moved again. - Where?

35
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,970
市政厅艺廊正在举办一次非洲展览...
The Guildhall Art Gallery is holding a major African exhibition...

36
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,010
来配合英联邦首脑会议
to coincide with the Commonwealth summit.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,530
从后天开始...
It starts the day after tomorrow...

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,330
而这颗非洲之星就是中心装饰品
and the Star of Africa is to be the centerpiece.

39
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,050
好了.想想吧
All right.Think of it.

40
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,370
本世纪最伟大的一次记录,或是最后一次
The biggest score of this century or the last.

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,370
某些会在100年,甚至200年 以后还被记住的事情
Something that will be remembered 100,even 200 years from now.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,170
一切我懂的,一切我所学到的 都在等着这一时刻
Everything I know,everything I've learned has been waiting for this moment.

43
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,770
没有比这更大的东西会再出现在我们面前
Nothing this big will ever come our way again.

44
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,290
而不利的是,如果我们被抓住了...
The downside is,if we get caught...

45
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,410
我们都会在监狱里面待上很长时间
we all go to prison for a very long time.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,370
- 你还好吗,Mick? - 是啊,就那样吧
- You all right,Mick?You on your own? - Yeah,looks that way.

47
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,810
干杯
Cheers.

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,290
如果我不够了解你,我会说你在生气
If I didn't know better,I'd say you were sulking.

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,050
真的吗?
Really?

50
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,890
你在期盼什么?
What did you expect?

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,770
你要求他们把余生都压在这一次上
You asked them to put the rest of their lives on the line.

52
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,480
的确是
Yes,I did.

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,850
你掷骰子,他们紧紧盯着.就这样
You rolled the dice,they came up snake eyes.It happens.

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,890
是啊
Yep.

55
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,050
就告诉我一件事情
Just tell me one thing.

56
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,960
为什么?
Why?

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,850
因为300年来没有一个人敢对此进行尝试
Because no one has ever dared attempt anything this big for 300 years.

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,090
- 就这样? - 对于我来说,是的
- And that's it? - For me,yes.

59
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,730
瞧,这是镇里最大的游戏
Look,this is the biggest game in town.

60
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,690
如果我们不干,我们还能干什么
If we're not here,we're not anywhere.

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,130
我可以了解
I can see that.

62
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,290
你瞧,Mickey...
You see,Mickey...

63
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,970
之前我有我自己的顾虑...
I had my doubts earlier...

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,450
但你可以把我算在里面
but you can count me in.

65
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,330
谢谢,Danny.一语值千金
Thanks,Danny.That's worth a lot.

66
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,340
但如果没有Stacie和Ash的话还是不行
But this can't happen without Stacie and Ash.

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,810
真高兴听到你这么说
Glad to hear it.

68
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,780
- 他生气了吗,Albert? - 我想是的,是啊

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,090
- 哦哦 - 我没有生气

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,640
嗯,装的不错,看起来你自己承认了啊
Well,it worked,looks like you're getting your own way.

71
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,850
不,等等,拜托
No,now,wait a minute,come on.

72
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,930
这件事情对这里的任何人来说都 是件大事...
This thing is far too big for anyone to be here...

73
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,650
比他们想做的任何事情都要大
for any other reason than they want to be.

74
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,960
你现在可不能反悔了
You can't bottle it now.

75
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,570
啊哦,一开始他生气,而现在他却 想收手不干
Cor blimey,first he sulks,now he's trying to back out.

76

我没有要收手,但是...
I'm not backing out,but...

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,530
如果我们要做的话,我们需要万分小心
if we do this,we do it with our eyes open.

78
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,410
嘿,如果我们不能...
Hey,if we can't do it...

跟我说说吧.这里不会再有正直的骗子了

每个人都企图占你便宜

我看你说话还是很间接明了的啊,Benjamin

87
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,890
不要跟我说简洁明了,Stroller先生
Don't talk to me about words,Mr.Stroller.

88
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,370
握握手就可以了
Time was a handshake was enough.

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,810
现在,大家都像14岁的小毛头 带着没剔干净的鼻毛...
Now,everyone's 14,with spots and rings in their noses...

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,610
用天花乱坠的说辞来欺骗你

"这个的5%,那个的两成"

92
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,970
"钱的10%下个星期三就付给你"

93
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,170
- 是啊,这个世界已经大不同了 - 就是这样

Call me a Chinaman but my guess is you don't have a bag full of car radios.

98
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,290
- 不是的 - 那到底是什么?
- Not quite. - So what is it?

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,730
权杖钻石?
The Crown Jewels?

告诉我你们不是真的要

我们找到了为那家展览馆 做清理的公司

- No.Believe me,thank you very much. - Danny,what are you doing?

120
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,850
- 电话奖励,一分钟一英镑 - 什么?
- Premium phone line,50 quid a minute. - What?

121
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,450
我设置了这些线路中的一条 每次有人拨打这个号码...
I set up one of these lines.Every time somebody phones this number...

122
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,570
我的口袋里就会进账1英镑
I get 50 quid in me pocket.

123
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,690
但你怎么让别人打你这个号码呢?
But how are you going to get people to phone the number?

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,810
不,瞧,这就是我天才的地方
No,listen,this is where the genius comes in.

125
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,450
因为我无需这样,你瞧
'Cause I don't have to,you see.

126
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,290
我所要做的,就是我借个电话打 这个号码
All I got to do,yeah,is I borrow a phone and I call the number.

127
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,290
是的,然后它们会认为我花了10 先令的话费...
Yeah,then they think I'm making a 10p call...

128
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,450
但我口袋里却已经进账了1英镑
but I'm getting 50 big ones in me pocket.

129
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,650
- Danny - 是的,Mickey

你不让我用信用卡的
You did stop me using the credit cards.

131
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,690
- 他们会留下罪证的 - 但它们管用
- They were very bad copies. - But they did work.

132
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,810
我们已经被一家餐馆扔出来了
We got thrown out of a restaurant.

133
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,370
好吧,你对的.但我还是有些吃住的问题
Granted,everyone,but I had a few teething troubles.

134
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,290
Danny,我劝你最好专心到我们 手上的工作中
Danny,I would much rather you focused on the job in hand.

135
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,080
我一直关心的,伙计们,我关心的 这只是我的一点点副业而已
I'm focused,gang,I'm focused.This is just a little sideline.

136
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,250
我要弄点点钱在你让我们被捕后 还能买一些烟草
Make a little bit of money to buy some tobacco when you get us all arrested.

137
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,290
Eddie,我能借用下你的电话吗,伙计?给我老妈打个电话
Eddie,can I borrow your phone,mate?Just got to phone me old mom.

138
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,960
哈,妈妈?

139
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,330
我会看着你
I'll be watching you.

140
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,530
- 我刚泡了一壶茶 - 哦,谢谢

141
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,970
我马上就干完了
I will just finish my work.

142
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,890
你会把清漆都磨掉的 你还在磨
You'll wear the varnish off,you polish it any more.

143
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,650
但我想干得更好一些
But I want to do a good job.

144
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,050
是的.但如果你喝杯茶后会干得更好
Yes,and you'll do a better job with a cup of tea inside you.

145
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,970
我5分钟就好
I be five minute.

146
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,680
Lily
Lily.

147
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,170
- 那里怎么了? - 有某个特别的展览
- What is happening in there? - Some kind of special exhibition.

148
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,970
非常机密的
All very hush- hush.

149
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,930
- 练习练习脚步 - 那音乐呢?
- Practicing a few moves. - And the music?

150
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,690
给我一些情绪
Get me in the mood.

151
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,450
- 对汤姆克鲁斯很管用,不是吗? - 好吧
- It worked for Tom Cruise,didn't it? - Okay.

152
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,730
我还没有进过里面的密室 但从我了解到的情况来看...
I haven't got in the chamber yet,but from what I've seen...

153
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,570
他们安装了行动探测器,激光 探测器,闭路电视...
they've got motion detectors,lasers,CCTV...

154
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,010
压力垫和带有时间锁的钢制门
pressure pads and a steel door with a time lock.

155
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,690
- 看来是双重保险啊 - 你要说的重点是什么?
- Belt and braces security then. - So what's the bottom line?

156
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,340
对我们来说,如果他们把它放在 伦敦塔里,说不定还简单些
It would have been easier if they'd kept it in the Tower of London.

157
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,880
没事的,我们有个在职的蜘蛛侠
It'll be okay,we've got Spiderman on board.

158
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,540
是啊,你们尽管笑话我吧
Yeah.Let's all have a good laugh.

159
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,970
听着,我就是唯一那个适合的人
Listen,I'll be the only one who's match fit,okay.

160
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,090
是的,对于压力垫我们无可奈何
Yeah,there's nothing we can do about the pressure pads.

161
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,370
我们只能绕过它行动
We'll have to work round them.

162
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,170
最大的问题会是那扇门
The biggest problem,though,will be the doors.

163
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,210
它们一旦被关闭后,只能到明天 早上才能打开
Once they're shut,there's no other way of opening them until the morning.

164
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,450
- 我们能通过其他途径进去吗? - 不.这是个密封的房间
- Can we get in any other way? - No.It's a sealed room.

165
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,810
- 没有窗户.所以他们选择了这里 - 我们能挖地道进去吗?
- No windows.That's why they chose it. - Can we tunnel in?

166
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,490
不,那会触动移动探测器
No,that would set off the motion detectors.

167
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,495
没有办法能把它们设置旁路吗?
And there's no way of bypassing them?

168
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,410
是的.如果有,那我也还没有发现
Yeah.If there is,I haven't found it.

169
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,250
Ash,你的意思就是说 我们应该放弃这次行动?
So what are you saying,Ash?We should just call the whole thing off?

170
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,690
不.再给我一点时间,我会找出方法的
No.Just give me a bit more time.I'll see what I can do.

171
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,090
同时...
In the meantime...

172
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,240
我上班要迟到了
I'm late for work.

173
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,170
是的
Yeah.

174
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,210
我再打给你吧
I'm gonna have to call you back.

你可以看出来它们是一致的

我都是通过正规渠道买进来的

有人试图烧毁它

190
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,890
这年头的小孩,无组织无纪律
Kids these days.No discipline.

191
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,410
火被扑灭了
The fire went out.

192
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,370
我们采集了指纹...
We dusted for prints...

193
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,930
你永远也猜不到我们找到了什么
and you'll never guess what we found.

194
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,210
完全匹配
Perfect match.

195
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,610
一目了然,Benny

- How long,Mr.Wells? - With your form,fifteen years.

197
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,730
如果你认罪,或许是判12年
You take a guilty,you might get 12.

198
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,090
那么?

199
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,490

Look,I think I've got it.There's a safety feature on the door.

里面时间锁上有个面板 如果有人被锁在里面就能起作用
The time lock's got a panel on the inside,in case anyone gets locked in.

228
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,170
我们能利用这个吗?
So can we use that?

229
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,770
如果我们中有人能在他们关门 之前就在里面

242
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,170
我发誓现在的时间应该比这个要晚
I could have sworn it was later than that.

243
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,090
- 好吧,你们再喝一杯 - 你太棒了

好了,继续.跟我说说这个安全装置
Right,come on,tell me about this safety feature.

245
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,160
长官?
Sir?

246
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,370
- DS Hodges? - 是的,长官
- DS Hodges? - Yes,sir.

247
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,531
你的档案告诉我你曾经调查过去年的一个案子
Your DI tells me you were working on a case last year.

248
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:22,130
Michael Stone?
Michael Stone?

249
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,320
瞧,我们一直在监视Stone
Look,we had Stone under surveillance.

250
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,850
但他不知为何发现了
But he found out somehow.

251
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,090
然后弄了另外一个骗子装扮成了警察
And drafted in another grifter to impersonate a police officer.

252
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,930
案子就搞砸了?
And the case collapsed?

253
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,250
Stone的人介入了调查,长官
Stone's man ran the investigation,sir.

254
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,970
对你来说一定非常难堪
Must have been very embarrassing for you.

255
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,690
对这个部门来说都很难堪,长官
It was embarrassing for the whole department,sir.

256
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,810
- DCI Mullens因为这件事情而丢了工作 - 是吗,现在?
- DCI Mullens lost his job because of it. - Did he,now?

257
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,690

跟我说说这个人
Tell me about the man.

261
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,890
Mickey Stone是很独特的
Mickey Stone is unique.

262
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,050
他想的和我们不一样 你无法对他进行揣测
He doesn't think like we do.You can't second-guess him.

263
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,490
他给人的印象像是很随意地 走一步算一步
He gives the impression that he's making it all up as he goes along.

264
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,610
不
No.

265
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,970
但每件事情都计划过,非常精确
But everything is planned,precise.

266
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,330
- 为什么是我? - 你抽到了最短的麦杆
- Why me? - You drew the short straw.

267
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,010
我要申述
I demand a recount.

268
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,210
你要推我下去的时候...
So when you gonna push me... 

269
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,890
他会把一堆乱七八糟的事情放在一起...
He puts together complicated...

270
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,970
一堆看起来毫无关系的事情 根本想不到有关
and seemingly unrelated events,impossible to unravel.

271
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,170
服务员,我要一个这个
Waiter,I'll have one of those.

272
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,530
但所有的都指向一个大骗局
But all leading to the big con.

273
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,220
目标越大,他越喜欢
The higher the stakes,the more he likes it.

274
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,360
是的,要很长一段时间
Yes,it has been long.

275
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,010
你以为你抓住他的时候...
Just when you think you've got him...

276
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,730
我帮你找了份工作
I've got a job for you.

277
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,330
你坐着吗?
Are you sitting down?

278
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,290
- ...其实你没有 - 听起来,你像是个大粉丝
- ...you haven't. - You sound like a bit of a fan.

279
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,130
绝对不是,长官,他让我看起来 像是个无能的白痴
Hardly,sir,he made me look like an incompetent idiot.

280
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,970
如果能让你找回自我的话如何?
Then how would you like to get your own back?

281
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,250
哦,上帝!对不起
Oh,God!Sorry.

282
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,530
我跟你说,我绝对有些感冒了
I tell you now,I've definitely caught something.

283
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,289
这件事情除非我们能先在展览馆里面安插好人手
Okay,this thing isn't going to work 

284
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,450
否则就无法进行...
unless we can get someone inside the gallery...

285
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,810
特别是在门被锁上以后要在展室里面有人
and in the exhibition room when the doors are locked.

286
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,210
一旦夜间门被关闭,只能从里面打开
Once they're locked for the night,the doors can only be opened from the inside.

287
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,010
- 而这就是你要进去的地方 - 怎么进?
- Which is where you come in. - How?

288
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,130
Ash
Ash.

289
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,490
我们可以从空中着手以避开压力垫
We can get round the pressure pads by going over the top.

290
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,140
关键问题是,门的时间锁旁边围绕着...
The main problem,though,aside from the time lock on the door...

291
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,730
激光探测器和动作探测器
will be the lasers and the motion detectors.

292
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,930
就像我说的,我们没有办法可以设置旁路...
Like I said,there's no way we can bypass them...

293
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,730
一旦我们步入房间它们就会引发警报
and they'll set the alarms off as soon as we set foot in the room.

294
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,010
- 解决办法呢? - 至今看来唯一可以解决的办法就是...
- Solution? - The only way round it as far as I can see...

295
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,770
- 切断电源 - 会让警报关闭吗?
- is to cut the power. - Won't that set the alarms off?

296
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,420
是的,但如果我们在马路外面做...
Yeah,but if we do it outside somewhere in the road...

297
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,640
我们会破坏整个街道的电力
we'll knock out the whole street.

298
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,090
- 那所有的警报就都会消失 - 聪明
- There'll be alarms going off everywhere. - Smart.

299
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,970
同时,我们就有30秒的时间来 通过动作探测器...
During that time,we'll have 30 seconds to cover up the motion detectors...

300
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,090
到达门的面板处,关闭激光探测器
and get to the door panel to stop the lasers from coming back on.

301
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,040
- 时间够吗? - 只能那么多时间
- Will that be enough time? - It'll have to be.

302
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,050
一旦有电力恢复,激光和所有 警报设备就会重新开启
Once the genny kicks in,the lasers and everything else will be back on.

303
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,200
闭路电视呢?
CCTV?

304
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,290
我可以在停电的时候重新 设置录像源
I can re-route those at source during the blackout.

305
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,370
- 很好 - 那么,我要做什么?
- Good. - So,what do I have to do then?

306
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,410
在我们打开那扇门之前,必须关闭...
The motion detectors and the lasers have to be disabled from the inside...

307
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,210
动作探测器和激光探测器
before we open the door.

308
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,570
展览有5个主要的负责人
The exhibition has five main exhibitors.

309
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,960
最重要的那个人就是Joyce Martin
The biggest of which is Joyce Martin.

310
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,850
你专门研究哪个部分?
So what is your area of expertise?

311
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,850
我绝对的崇拜从尼日尔三角区 来的Urhobo的那块
I absolutely adore the Urhobo pieces from the Niger Delta.

312
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,610
尤其是Iphri版画
Particularly the Iphri carved figures.

313
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,450
但是,出了传统的之外...
But,aside from the traditional...

314
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,730
我还对一些更加现代的部分感兴趣...
I've always had a deep affection for some of the more contemporary pieces...

315
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,570
例如Bruce Onobrakpeya的环氧树脂版画
such as Bruce Onobrakpeya's epoxy resin etchings.

316
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,610
太让人着迷了
Completely stunning.

317
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,650
谁用了我的电话?
Who's been using my phone?

318
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,690
- Mick,我能说句话吗? - 当然可以
- Mick,can I say something? - Yeah,of course.

319
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,170
- 我现在感觉真的很不好 - 为什么?
- I've got a really bad feeling about this. - How so?

320
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,850
- 我不知道,只是觉得... - 有勇无谋?
- I don't know,it just feels... - Foolhardy?

321
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,770
是的,有那么点意思
Yeah,that'll do for a start.

322
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,090
Ash,这是我们做过的最大的案子
Ash,this is the biggest thing we've ever done.

323
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,890
- 不可能那么简单 - 是啊,但有太多我们会失手的地方
- It was never gonna be easy. - Yeah,but there's so much can go wrong.

324
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,440
我知道,但不会的.不会的
I know,but it won't.It won't.

325
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,210
好吧,说说
Okay,say it.

326
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,730
不要让我失手,我不是在指责你
Don't get me wrong,I'm not criticizing you.

327
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,450
我知道你是个惊人的天才
I think you're a flaming genius.

328
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,210
- 但我必须说出我所想的 - 你觉得这是个馊主意
- But I have to say what I think. - And you think this is a bad idea.

329
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,050
那是我心里的想法
It's what me gut says.

330
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,960
好啊,亲爱的.新面孔啊.你怎么样?
Hello,sweetheart.New face.How you doing?

331
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,090
非常感谢,再见
Thank you very much.Goodbye.

332
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,570
标书在里面
Bids are in.

333
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,850
Albie打电话来,一切已经就绪
And Albie called,everything is set his end.

334
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,000
Joyce Martin?
Joyce Martin?

335
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,290
她让我负责在展会继续展览的事宜
She's put me in charge of the items going on show at the exhibition.

336
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,250
那么我们准备好了吗?
So are we good to go?

337
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,360
是的,明天晚上
Yeah.Tomorrow night.

338
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,730
钻石,明天早上会在...
The diamond,it'll be delivered to the gallery...

339
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,050
全副武装的警卫下运送到展览馆
under armed guard tomorrow morning.

340
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,610
我们知道Mickey Bricks和他的小组...
We know that Mickey Bricks and his team...

341
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,090
想偷钻石
are going to steal it.

342
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,530
这是第一次我们有个良好的开端
This is the first time that we've got a head start.

343
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,000
他们不可能知道我们已经盯上他们了
There is no way they can know we're onto them.

344
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,450
- 我们必须利用这一点 - 好的,我们知道他们很聪明
- We must use that. - Okay,we know they're smart.

345
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,130
所以不要监视
So no surveillance.

346
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,850
我不想冒着被他们看出 这次行动风吹草动的险
I won't risk them getting wind of this operation.

347
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,490
那就表示我们只是简单的看着展览馆...
Which means that we simply watch the gallery...

348
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,410
等待他们的行动
and wait for them to make their move.

349
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,170
- 所有人都明白了吗? - 是的,老大
- Does everyone understand that? - Yes,guv.

350
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,130
这个小组太多次让我们看起来像傻瓜了
This team has made us look like fools too many times.

351
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,290
这次轮到我们
This time it's our turn.

352
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,420
我找到了一个地方来割断电力设备 但还有个问题
I've found a place to cut off the power,but there's a problem.

353
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,010
- 什么? - 我一次不能出现在两个地方
- What? - I can't be in two places at once.

354
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,130
在电源断开的同时...
At the same time the power is being cut off...

355
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,780
有人必须对闭路电视的录像 做个重录
someone has to be re-routing the feed to the CCTV cameras.

356
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,450
你不能教某人来做吗?
Can't you show someone how to do that?

357
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,330
不,最好是我做 不过可以找人来切断电源
No,it's best if I do it.Someone else can do the electricity.

358
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,980
- 好吧,教Danny - 我?不
- Okay,show Danny. - Me?No.

359
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,960
不,我对配线一窍不通
No,I have trouble wiring a plug.

360
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,890
没事的.我会直接教你 我们可以用对讲机
It's all right.I'll talk you through it.We can use walkie-talkies.

361
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,410
- 好吧,我来 - Stacie,你怎么进入展览馆?
- Okay,I'll do it. - Stacie,how you getting on at the gallery?

362
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,610
我已经找到了一个好地方
I've found a piece that's perfect.

363
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,770
- Albert? - 所有一切就绪
- Albert? - Everything will be ready.

364
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,810
好的,展览明天开幕 我们先睡个好觉吧
Okay,the exhibition opens tomorrow.So let's get some sleep.

365
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,290
我们会到这里.在控制室里面有4个警卫
We'll come in here.There'll be four guards in the control room.

366
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,650
一个会一直在巡逻
One will be doing his rounds.

367
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,490
没有换班的空闲,所以我们只能穿过他
Yeah,there's no set time,so the chances are we'll have to get past him.

368
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,610
这个搞定了...
That done...

369
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,050
Ash就会给Danny发出信号切断电源...
Ash will give the signal to Danny to cut the power...

370
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,610
可以让我们有30秒的时间来 重新录制闭路电视...
which will give us 30 seconds to re-route the CCTV...

371
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,650
而Stacie则负责她的事情
and for Stacie to do her thing.

372
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:01,090
你必须在电力恢复之前到达门口
You must get to the door before the emergency power kicks in.

373
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,290
- 好的 - 否则你就会被激光探测器逮到
- Okay. - Or you'll be trapped by the lasers.

374
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,250
你们一切都搞定后 我们应该在另外一边
When you've done that,we should be on the other side.

375
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,170
我要走了
I'd better go.

376
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,330
- Albert呢? - 二层楼
- Albert? - Second floor.

377
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,210
你们必须准时
And you must be on time.

378
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,250
我们会的.还有什么问题吗?
We will.Any questions?

379
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,130
- 没了 - 我们开始吧
- No. - Then let's go.

380
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,610
谢谢你听我说,亲爱的
Thanks for listening,sweetheart.

381
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,170
无线静音,直到进一步的指示
Radio silence until further notice.

382
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,970
清洁公司
Cleaning team.

383
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,610
准时到
On time.

384
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,170
- 你好了吗,Mick? - 是的
- You okay,Mick? - Yeah.

385
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,650
把那个放回我的包里
Put that back in me bag.

386
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,160
好的
All right.

387
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,210
或许他们不是今天晚上做
Maybe they're not going to do it tonight.

388
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,090
现在我该怎么做?
Now what do I do?

389
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,130
- 好了 - 很好
- Okay. - All right.

390
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,570
- 来吧,亲爱的.我们走 - 好的
- Come on,baby.There we go. - All right.

391
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,840
准备好了,Mick
We're on,Mick.

392
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,890
现在我们会录一会儿这个 然后通过线路回录到带子中
Now we'll tape it for a while and then feed the tape through on a loop.

393
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,250
好了
Okay.

394
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,410
- Danny,来吧 - 准备好了.结束
- Danny,come in. - Ready,over.

395
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,490
好点.应该够了
Okay,that should be enough.

396
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,520
Danny?
Danny?

397
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,290
你把盒子放到适当的位置了吗?
Have you got the box in place?

398
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,120
坚持下
Hang on.

399
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,770
是的,我已经放好了
Yeah,I got the box in place.

400
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,610
当你夹上夹子的时候 不会发生任何事情
When you put the clips on,nothing will happen.

401
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,730
10秒以后,电力系统会被切断
Then after 10 seconds,the power will cut out.

402
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,770
把鳄鱼夹夹在两个... 
Take the crocodile clips and clip them both on the...

403
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,690
Vinny,你在哪呢,亲爱的?
Vinny,where are you,mate?

404
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:54,220
我选择在Chapel Road 19号,West One
I've got a pick up at 19 Chapel Road,West One.

405
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,930
哈,你在我的频道里
Hello,you're on my frequency.

406
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:58,610
我觉得你会发现事实上你是在 我的频道里,亲爱的
I think you'll find you're on mine actually,darling.

407
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,890
就下下线吧,你个昏睡的母牛
Just get off the line,you dozy cow.

408
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,290
你是想用那个频道跟我说话 呢还是想叫辆出租车
Don't you use that tone with me or you won't get a cab.

409
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,570
我不要出租车,赶紧下线
I don't want a bleeding cab.Just get off the line.

410
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,170
- 那是谁,Mary? - 一个乱七八糟的小混蛋

00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,330
你或许觉得你是清白的 但我知道就是你做的
You might think you're clever,but I know you did this.

558
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,250
我会把你关起来
And I'm going to put you away.

559
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,210
- 不管有没有钻石 - 长官?
- With or without the diamond. - Sir?

560
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,450
我想你最好看看这个
I think you better see this.

561
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,210
这是我们从Morgan的相机里得到的照片
It's the film we took from Morgan's camera.

562
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,850
测试.1,2,3,4.你们后面的能听得到我吗?
Testing.One,two,three,four.Can you hear me at the back?

563
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,690
女士们先生们,欢迎来到警局 英勇奖章颁发现场
Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to the Police Courage Awards.

564
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,010
请大家按位子坐好
Would you please make your way towards your seats.

565
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,090
典礼马上就开始.谢谢
And the ceremonies will begin very shortly.Thank you.

566
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,850
今晚要颁发的是新近设立的 市民奖项
And now the last of tonight's civilian awards goes to a late entry.

567
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,050
某人就在几天之前...
Someone who was brought to the Commissioner's attention...

568
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,970
引起了委员的注意
only a few days ago.

569
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,730
谢谢
Thank you.

570
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:14,930
服务员,我要一份这个
Waiter,I'll have one of those.

571
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,690
有一个人,不顾自身安危...
A man who,without any thought for his own safety...

572
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,130
挽救了一名年轻路人的生命
saved the life of a fellow rambler.

573
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,930
Michael Stone和那个他拯救了 的人,Daniel Blue
Michael Stone and the man who's life he saved,Daniel Blue.

574
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,130
我正在河边慢跑
I was leaning down.

575
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,770
看见了一只受伤的小鸭子
There was an injured duck,you see.

576
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,250
我正试图帮助...
So there I was just trying to help...

577
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,650
帮助这个可怜的小家伙 突然,我一失足...
just help the little fellow,when suddenly,I lost me footing...

578
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,770
等我能意识到的时候 我已经在水里了
and the next thing I knew,I was in the water.

579
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,890
- 为什么是我? - 你抽到了最短的麦杆
- Why me? - You drew the short straw.

580
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,410
我要申述
I demand a recount.

581
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,530
你推我下去的时候...
So when you gonna push me...

582
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,580
我快淹死了.几乎淹死了
I was drowning.Definitely drowning.

583
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,490
- 我不会游泳.救命 - 嘿
- I can't swim.Help. - Hey.

584
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:18,450
我的一生在眼前像电影一般放过...
My whole life started flashing before me...

585
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,890
我刚刚离开学校...
I'd just left school...

586
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,090
然后就感到有一双坚强的手把 我拉了起来
and I felt a strong hand pulling me up.

587
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,480
那就是他,那就是他
There he is,there he is.

588
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,970
那就是Stone先生
It was Mr.Stone.

589
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:34,090
他...
He...

590
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,850
救了我的命.谢谢
saved my life.Thank you.

591
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,560
没什么的
Doesn't mean anything.

592
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,050
在没有钻石这种情况下 我们没法逮捕他们
We've got nothing to place them at the scene and no diamond.

593
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,450
- 他们肯定藏起来了 - 那更糟糕
- They've hidden it. - It gets worse.

594
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,450
我们知道钻石在10:30被偷的时候 离典礼地有半英里
We know the diamond was stolen half a mile from the ceremony at 10:30.

595
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,890
看专员的手表
The Commissioner's watch.

596
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,810
上面是10:20
It says 10:20.

597
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,170
你忘了什么东西
You've forgotten something.

598
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,370
那....
That's....

599
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:31,170
那不可能
That's not possible.

600
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:38,770
而后只要在最后,在上面洒上一层薄粉
And then just at the end,they add the little sprinkles on top.

601
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,480
就做成了一杯摩卡咖啡
And that's what makes it a mochaccino.

602
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:48,010
- 你可以走了 - 我没听清?
- You're free to go. - I'm sorry?

603
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,530
我说,你可以走了
I said you're free to go.

604
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,970
好吧,但我突然想起来了,我那个时候在...
Okay.It's just come back to me,where I was...

605
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,570
把他弄出去
Get him out of here.

606
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,720
很高兴又见到你.很有意思
Nice to see you again.It's been fun.

607
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,050
事情还没有结束.你们还必须要转移钻石
It's not over yet.You still have to move the diamond.

608
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:17,210
而你转移的时候,我就等在那里
And when you do,I'll be there.

609
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,650
- 你都去哪里了? - 嘿
- Where have you been? - Hey.

610
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,410
那个可爱的押管警官 他让我用了他的电话
The nice custody sergeant,he let me use his phone.

611
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:38,930
拜托,我们还没搞定呢
Come on,we haven't got long.

612
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,370
英国中央情报部
CID.

613
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,680
你肯定?
Are you sure?

614
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,130
好的,谢谢
Okay,thank you.

615
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,770
长官
Sir.

616
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,610
我们找到钻石了
We've found the diamond.

617
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,810
太好了
Yes.

618
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:27,850
- 在哪里? - 还在展览馆里
- Where is it? - It's still at the gallery.

619
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,290
Doris,我们做得如何了?
Doris,how did we do?

620
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,530
根据你的要求,复制了5份
Five copies as ordered.

621
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,890
太好了,Lily,再来一张,谢谢
That's great,Lily,just one more,please.

622
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,330
我不懂了
I don't understand.

623
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,890
为什么惹了那么大的麻烦...
Why go to all this trouble...

624
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,370
却不拿走钻石?
and not even take the diamond?

625
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,250
英格兰政府一定对这次偷盗非常难堪
The British government are naturally very embarrassed by this theft.

626
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:09,930
所以Ml6不得不编造出一个故事 来挽回他们的颜面
So Ml6 has come up with a plan to invent a story to save face.

627
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:13,250
他们会说钻石已经找到了...
They'll say the diamond has been found...

628
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,170
犯罪者也已经被抓住
and the perpetrators caught.

629
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:19,730
然后他们会把一颗赝品放进权杖 并重新放入伦敦塔
They'll then put a replica into the Royal Scepter and replace it in the Tower.

630
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,210
是啊,我们期待着掩盖故事...
Yeah,we're expecting the cover-up story to hit the press...

631
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:26,010
就在今天晚些时候,你能看到的
some time later today,just so you know.

632
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:31,130
然后,我所要做的就是来问你的出价了 我能用你的电话吗?
So then,all that leaves me to do is to ask you,can I use your phone?

633
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,970
谢谢
Thank you.

634
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,410
你好啊,妈妈?
Hello,Mom?

635
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,970
警察吗?
Police?

636
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:11,010
我想报告一些被盗物品的下落
I'd like to report the whereabouts of some stolen goods.

637
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,890
- 你获得特赦了? - 正在着手处理
- You got your amnesty? - In writing.

638
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,800
那么Benny...
And Benny...

639
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:28,530
- 好好享受你的退休吧 - 我肯定会的
- enjoy your retirement. - I certainly will.

640
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:37,810
哦,你这小信的人啊
Oh,ye of little faith.

641
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,810
你瞧,这是场完美的骗局
You see,it's the perfect con.

642
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,690
没有犯罪行为,所以没有人会为此被捕
There's no crime,so there's nothing to be arrested for.

643
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,770
唯一的输家就是那5个贪婪的 猪头买了5个赝品钻石
And the only losers are five mugs greedy enough to buy five fake diamonds.

644
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,050
当他们发现他们被骗的时候...
And when they find out they've been conned...

645
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,370
又会向谁去说呢?
who are they gonna tell?

646
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,490
这些,净赚的钱
There it is,back of the net.

647
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,010
好吧,我们要先干一杯 为了Mickey Bricks干杯...
Right,this is a toast.A toast to Mickey Bricks...

648
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,130
- 一个不容置疑的伟大天才 - 值得任何荣誉
- who is without doubt,a bleeding genius. - Worthy of any of the greats.

649
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,370
我还是觉得他应该一开始就告诉我们
I still think he should have told us at the start.

650
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:24,020
冒的险是一样的.如果你被抓住了...
The risk was the same.If you got caught...

651
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:27,680
谁会相信你没有偷钻石 而只是简单把它移动了一下?
who would have believed you weren't stealing the diamond,simply moving it?

652
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,360
你要再看一下吗?
Will you take a look at that?

653
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,690
好人啊,Lily.她值得有些小运气
Nice one,Lily.She deserved a bit of luck.

654
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:35,370
是啊,太漂亮了,Ash 和这个一样漂亮的一件事情是...
Yeah,it's beautiful,Ash,nearly as beautiful as the fact...

655
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,210
我手机上已经被打了93分钟的电话...
that I've now clocked up 93 minutes on my phone line...

656
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,650
我总共收到了2,500便士
which comes to 2,500.

657
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,440
好极了
Right on.

658
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,970
- 嘿 - 嘿

659
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,770

00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,400

661
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,450
- 请告诉我不是那样的 - 怎么了?
- Please tell me you didn't. - What?

662
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:58,410
警察在楼下...
The police are downstairs...

663
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,960
前台正在给他们看信用卡的收据
and the receptionist is showing them a credit card receipt.

664
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,440
所以,求你了,Danny,随便怎么样求你了...
So,please,Danny,pretty please with knobs on...

665
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,330
告诉我你不是用自己的信用卡
tell me you did not use one of yours.

666
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:10,050
- 我们最好打包走人 - Danny
- We better pack. - Danny.

667
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:20,210
我们刚刚赢得了一场本世纪最伟大的诈骗...
We've just pulled off the biggest con of the century...

668
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,770
而现在要偷偷溜出旅馆 就因为用信用卡付了账单
and we're sneaking out of a hotel for paying the bill with a bent credit card.

669
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:25,490
- 是的,骂我吧,你们为什么不骂我? - 我们骂了
- Yeah,blame me,why don't you? - We do.

670
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,290
我这几天过的太痛苦了,你们知道吗
I've had a very rough couple of days,you know.

671
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:30,170
全都是为了我们这个小组啊 我被推进了该死的水道里
All for the good of the team.I've been pushed in that bloody canal.

672
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,210
几乎快淹死了.我还触了电,差点被油炸
Nearly drowned.I been electrocuted,nearly fried.

673
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,170
我经历了一段非常痛苦的日子 我要让你们知道
I've had a very harrowing time,I'll have you know.

674

- 你有没有在听我说? - 没有
- Are you lot listening to me? - No.

675
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,410
