要是我只会做一件事 那就是怎么推屁股
If I know how to do anything, it's how to move an ass.

55
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:20,582
这话不假
That's true. Yeah.

56
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:24,887
哇 你手上的杂志数量比阿曼达・拜恩斯的心理问题还多

看看这些 "佳丽新娘"
Look at all these. Beautiful Bride,

58
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:28,807
"时尚新娘" "都市新娘"?
Modern Bride, City Bride?

59
00:02:28,809 --> 00:02:32,094
你真得需要"非裔新娘"吗?
And do you really need African American Bride?

60
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:35,380
我这不还没完全放弃玉米辫嘛
Well, I haven't ruled out cornrows.

61
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:37,433
玉米辫配喜驴?
Cornrows and a donkey?

待我留着回头欣赏
Save that one for later.

66
00:02:48,662 --> 00:02:51,280
我差点忘了我是待婚之人

67
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,664
留着她
Keep her.

69
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,420
Sophie 为什么不找你的伴娘帮忙?
Sophie, why don't you get some help from your Maid of Honor?

70
00:02:58,422 --> 00:02:59,421
我要杀了你
I will kill you.

71
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,173
或者雇个婚礼策划人?
Or a wedding planner?

72
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:06,345
想起来了 Sophie 我表妹Svetlana就是策划婚礼的
Oh, Sophie, my cousin, Svetlana, is a wedding planner.

73
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:09,798
那好 她最好在行
Okay, but she better be good.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,970
因为我的大婚之日要求万无一失
Because I want everything to be perfect on my big day.

75
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,806
我俩的大婚之日
Our big day.

76
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:23,695
是 行
Yeah. Sure.

77
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,697
真是难以置信
I can't believe this.

78
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,149
他们就要结婚了 而我的喜驴
They're getting married and I don't have a wedding donkey

79
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:30,486
却不着天际
anywhere on my horizon.

80
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:33,322
天啊 你们卖这款T恤?
OMG, you sell these T-shirts?

81
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,207
我刚买了件
I just bought one.

82
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:37,543
我是刚卖完你衣服 就忘了这事吗?
Did I just sell you that shirt and already forgot?

83
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:38,827
早知道那瓶九分钱的除臭剂
I knew that nine-cent deodorant

84
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:41,997
会给我大脑创伤的
was going to give me brain lesions.

85
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,999
标签上的确贴了张大脑图
Well, the label did have a picture of a brain

86
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:47,719
还标明"不带甲酮"
with "No Bueno" written on it.

87
00:03:47,721 --> 00:03:49,888
不 我是在曼哈顿的一家店买的
No, I bought it at a store in Manhattan

88
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,673
就在东九道和百老汇那
on East Ninth and Broadway.

89
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:53,992
我是因为强迫症才知道的 它离街角
I know because I'm OCD and it was 67 steps

90
00:03:53,994 --> 00:03:57,679
一共隔了67步和14条人行道
and 14 sidewalk cracks from the corner.

91
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:00,015
Max 有人在卖我们的衣服
Max, someone else is selling our shirts.

92
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:01,517
我知道
I know.

93
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,103
我们被别人坑了
We're getting hosed by some other hoes.

94
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:10,025
他们竟敢抄袭我们的衣服
I can't believe they stole our shirt.

95
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:13,228
我们唯一受顾客青睐的产品
The one thing we made that people actually wanted to buy.

96
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,414
跟"我的空间"一个遭遇
I feel like MySpace.

97
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:17,749
我好久没对一个展柜如此气愤了
I haven't seen anything this upsetting in a window

98
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,701
上一次还是我不小心瞥见镜中
since that time I accidentally caught a reflection

99
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:24,506
自己穿服务生制服的样子
of myself in my waitress uniform.

100
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:25,841
我们得找人说理
We need to talk to someone

101
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:27,209
评评这些被抬高价钱的衣服
about those damn shirts you jacked.

102
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,594
我们来闹事的
We about to rumble.

103
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,596
她的意思是 我们想找人谈谈
What she means is, we wish to speak to someone

104
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,881
展柜里那些可爱的纸杯蛋糕T恤
about the adorable cupcake T-shirts in the window.

105
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:35,884
不然就要闹事
Or, we will be about to rumble.

106
00:04:35,886 --> 00:04:37,886
我在这不过是打点零工
I'm just working here till I get my PhD

107
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:41,390
就等着考上西方文明社会经济学博士
in the Eco-Social Dynamics of Western Civilization.

108
00:04:41,392 --> 00:04:43,442
也就是说 等一辈子?
So, forever?

109
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:45,060
这些T恤是我们设计的
Those T-shirts are our design

110
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,395
我们想弄清为什么这里有卖
and we need to know why they're here

111
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:48,230
以及是谁剽窃的
and who knocked them off.

112
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:50,182
是本店老板娘的孙女
It's the granddaughter of the woman who owns this shop.

113
00:04:50,184 --> 00:04:52,951
她算个折腾精 而且她要进来了
She's kind of a monster and she's walking in right now.

114
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,786

121
00:05:03,964 --> 00:05:04,963

Ashlin和Kimberly 对吧?
Ashlin and Kimberly, is it?

124
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:10,719
是Kemberly 带字母E的
It's Kemberly, with an "E""

125
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,055
我自己改的名 因为我很独特
I changed it myself 'cause I'm original.

126
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,591
对 她是独特的
Yeah, she's an original.

127
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:17,759
你知道什么不算独特(原创)吗?
You know what's not original?

128
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:20,145
这些衣服 你们抄袭我们的
Those shirts. You stole them from us.

129
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,930
我们没剽窃你的创意
We did not steal your idea.

130
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:24,316
对 我们没剽窃你的创意
Yeah, we did not steal your idea.

131
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:28,770
我们抄袭的是布鲁克林一家破纸杯蛋糕店
We copied it from this lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

132
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:31,273
等等...
Wait a minute...

133
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:35,410
我们就在布鲁克林开了一家纸杯蛋糕店
we have a lame cupcake shop in Brooklyn.

134
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,247
Ashlin 你太多嘴
Ashlin, you talk too much.

135
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,282
大家就是这么知道我做了胃束带手术的
This is why everyone knows about my lap-band.

136
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,451
我觉得他们之所以知道 是因为你短短一个春假间
I think they know about it because you lost 200 pounds

137
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:45,254
瘦了200镑
over Spring break.

138
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:48,674
真不敢相信她过去比现在还可恶两倍
It's hard to believe she was once twice this obnoxious.

139
00:05:48,676 --> 00:05:50,175
若不停售我们的T恤
If you don't stop selling our T-shirts,

140
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:52,010
就只能让我们的律师接管了
we're gonna have to get our lawyer involved.

141
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,013
对 让我们的律师接管
Yeah, we're gonna have to get our lawyer involved.

142
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,100
然后他会杀了你的
And he's gonna kill you.

143
00:05:58,102 --> 00:06:00,852
我不知道什么是律师
I don't know what lawyers do.

144
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:03,138
我们绝不是为了私利而为
We're totally not doing this for us.

145
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,139
我们很有钱的
We're rich.

146
00:06:04,141 --> 00:06:05,974
对 我们很有钱
Yeah, we're rich.

147
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,143
每卖出一件衣服 就有一部分善款捐给慈善组织
A percentage of every shirt that we sell goes to charity.

148
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:10,862
对 捐给慈善组织
Yeah, it goes to charity.

149
00:06:10,864 --> 00:06:14,950
我们就是需要被捐助的人
We are the charity that it needs to go to.

150
00:06:14,952 --> 00:06:16,652
你们又老又缺钱
You're old and desperate for money.

151
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:18,453
我很能理解
And I totally get it.

152
00:06:18,455 --> 00:06:20,322
我姑姑也是纽约的"绝望主妇"之一
My aunt's one of the Real Housewives of New York.

153
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:22,324
但是 抱歉
But, sorry.

154
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:27,629
是缺一条腿的那个
It's the one without the leg.

155
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:29,214
刚刚在这里发生了什么?
What just happened here?

156
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,716
那姑娘刚刚说你老
That girl just called you old.

157
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,141
Earl 我想我最近一段时间不会给你买
Earl, I don't think I'm going to be buying you that pinky ring

158
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:47,962
你要的尾戒
you wanted any time soon.

159
00:06:47,964 --> 00:06:50,298
不急 Max 你有的是时间
No rush, Max, you got plenty of time.

160
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,920
在我入土之前 我还有六七个月的时间
I got like, six or seven months before I turn to dust.

161
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:57,922
这是因为我们的衬衫
It's 'cause our T-shirts got ripped off

162
00:06:57,924 --> 00:07:00,224
被几个曼哈顿的预科学校的妹子给剽窃了
by a couple of prep school girls in Manhattan.

163
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:02,927
就像一部80年代的劣质电影
It's like a bad 80's movie.

164
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,762
我不知道该去跟詹姆斯・斯派德约会
I don't know whether to date James Spader

165
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:10,267
还是去教镇上的人跳舞
or teach this town how to dance.

166
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,819
这太不公平了
This is so unfair.

167
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:13,487
那些姑娘不能就这么偷我们的东西
Those girls can't just steal from us.

168
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:16,657
这又不是7-11便利店
This isn't 7-Eleven.

169
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,560
Max 我没想到你居然这么天真
Max, I can't believe your naivete?

170
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:23,497
这跟我飞溅的口水有什么关系?
What does my body spray have to do with anything?

171
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:25,783
听着 我们没理由对那俩姑娘
Look, there is no reason to be so upset

172
00:07:25,785 --> 00:07:27,335
感到不爽
about those two girls.

173
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:29,120
他们不会影响我们的生意
They're not going to affect our business.

174
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:31,288
而且 他们不得不自我煎熬
Plus, they have to live with themselves.

175
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,957
因果报应向来很准
And karma is a bitch.

176
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:38,446
我是说 我曾经乱丢垃圾 再看我遭了什么报应
I mean, I littered once and look what happened to me.

177
00:07:38,448 --> 00:07:42,466
嘿 各位亲
Hey, everybody.

178
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:47,438
婚礼的废品把我弄疯了
I'm up to my nuts in bridal junk.

179
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:49,473
她来了
There she is.

180
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:50,808
我一生的挚爱
The love of my life.

181
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,326
她是我勃起时要的阴道
The yin to my yang.

182
00:07:52,328 --> 00:07:56,530
也是我阳痿时的性奋剂
The zing to my wang.

183
00:07:56,532 --> 00:08:00,501
把你的金句留到宣誓再说
Save that gold for the vows.

184
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:02,887
我叫Svetlana 是Oleg的表姐妹
I am Svetlana, Oleg's cousin.

185
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:04,538
亲爱的 还能更糟点
Well, darling, it could be worse.

186
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,491
你可以当他的亲姐妹
You could be his sister.

187
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:09,493
嗨 Svetty!
Svetty!

188
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:12,463
你一定就是Sophie
And you must be Sophie.

189
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:13,998
是
Yeah.

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,334
不
No.

191
00:08:17,336 --> 00:08:20,004
她还什么都没说呢
But you haven't even heard any ideas.

192
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:23,741
Caroline啊
Caroline.

193
00:08:23,743 --> 00:08:25,509
Sophie 你为什么叫我的名字?
Sophie, why did you just say my name?

194
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:28,596
哦 这是我和Oleg的暗号
Oh, it's Oleg's and my safe word.

195
00:08:31,851 --> 00:08:36,404
意思是"不"
Yeah. It means no.

196
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:41,492
这是我们一致同意不会在做爱过程中说的话
It's the one word we both agreed we would never say during sex.

197
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:44,829
你确定吗?
Are you sure?

198
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:49,583
因为预定婚礼策划附赠汽车换油保养一次哦
Because I give free oil change with every wedding.

199
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:53,921
Caroline啊
Caroline.

200
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:59,009
好吧 我要坐我的位置
All right, well, I'll be in my booth.

201
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:02,546
婚礼策划人和同名电影"婚礼策划人"
You know, this wedding planner thing is as crappy as the movie

202
00:09:02,548 --> 00:09:06,350
一样垃圾
of the same name.

203
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:08,719
姑娘们 我忘了告诉你们
Girls, I forgot to tell you,

204
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:11,522
今天来的一个男人拿了封信给你们
a man came by today with this letter for you.

205
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:17,061
这让我想起自己还是年轻能干的快递员的时候
This reminds me of when I was a young, hot-shot courier.

206
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,897
我以前也是年轻能干的快递员
I was a young, hot-shot courier once, too.

207
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,535
我曾经踩着三轮车 给正在上班的我妈送毒品
I used to deliver drugs to my mother at work on my tricycle.

208
00:09:24,537 --> 00:09:26,737
天啊 Max 你不会相信的
Oh, my God, Max, you're not gonna believe this,

209
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:30,074
但那俩姑娘已经申请了停止不正当竞争的命令
but those two girls have issued a Cease and Desist order.

210
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:31,075
那俩贱人
Those bitches.

211
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,960
那是什么?
What's that?

212
00:09:32,962 --> 00:09:35,963
她们要求我们必须停止出售我们的衬衫
They're saying we have to stop selling our T-shirts.

213
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,581
这正是我告诉他们 我们要做的事
That's what I told them we were going to do.

214
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,467
他们连这个想法都抄袭了
They even copied this idea.

215
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:41,302
我们需要一个律师
We need to get a lawyer.

216
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:45,306
怎么请? 我们连iTunes上的"法律与秩序"(美剧)都买不起
How? We can't even afford Law & Order on iTunes.

217
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,590
嘿 你觉得我们请得起地铁广告牌上的
Hey, do you think we could afford that lawyer

218
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,259
律师吗?
on the subway billboards?

219
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:52,313
一手拿着锤子一手拿着只鸡的那个?
The one who has a gavel in one hand and a chicken in the other?

220
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:56,934
我想他只会导致交通事故
I think he just does acidentes.

221
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,602
这是什么情况啊?
What is going on here?

222
00:09:58,604 --> 00:10:00,171
菜在窗口晾着
There's food waiting in the window,

223
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:02,223
杂志四处散着
periodicals strewn about.

224
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:05,326
某人大姨夫又来了
Someone's on his periodical.

225
00:10:05,328 --> 00:10:06,827
Han 我们刚刚被人摆了一道
Han, we just got served.

226
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:11,115
至少餐厅里还有人被招待
At least someone in the diner has.

227
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,417
你们很幸运 你们的老板这么冷静
You're lucky your boss is so chill.

228
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:18,038
你当然冷了 你是"波普先生的企鹅"中的一只
Of course you're chill, you're one of Mr. Popper's penguins.

229
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:24,011
这么着怎么样?
How about this?

230
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:26,463
如果你同意假扮我们的律师
We'll do the jobs you already pay us for

231
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:28,799
我们就会完成你付了工钱的工作
if you agree to pretend to be our lawyer.

232
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,134
你有西装 对吧?
You have a suit, right?

233
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,635
我为什么要假扮律师?
Why would I pretend to be a lawyer?

234
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:36,307
你们连假扮服务员都不会
You can't even pretend to be waitresses.

235
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:39,476
不管怎样 没人会相信Han是我们的律师
No one's gonna believe Han's our lawyer, anyway.

236
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:44,315
他无法通过律师资格考试 他连眼睛都不够吧台高
He can't pass the bar, he can barely see over one.

237
00:10:44,317 --> 00:10:47,284
够了! 我受够你们俩和你们那套不工作的理论了
That's it! I've had it with you two and your non-work ethic.

238
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:48,986
这里是为顾客服务的
And this area is for customers.

239
00:10:48,988 --> 00:10:50,821
我要这些东西出去!
I want these out of here!

240
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:55,292
嗷!
Ow!

241
00:10:55,294 --> 00:10:56,544
完了
Uh-oh.

242
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:59,663
Max吗?
Max?

243
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:02,800
只要这样做你能忘了我砸你这件事
I suppose I could dig up a suit if that could, somehow,

244
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:06,136
我想我会想办法翻出套西装来
make this boss striking his employee thing go away.

245
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:18,561
Max 这些姑娘当然会去Dalby Hall
Max, of course these girls go to Dalby Hall,

246
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,280
我的所有敌人都去了
all my archenemies did.

247
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:23,733
但是我猜Lady Gaga最后会赢
I guess Lady Gaga won in the end, though.

248
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:27,737
另一则新闻 我有点喜欢这个眼罩
In other news, I kind of like this eye-patch.

249
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:29,572
我知道你喜欢 你刚刚一直在地铁里
I know you do, you were pretending to be

250
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:32,242
假扮海盗女王
the pirate queen of the subway.

251
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:36,246
没人敢跟我们撕逼
Well, no one arrrrrgued with us.

252
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,798
眼科医生说你得带着它多长时间?
How long did the eye doctor say you have to keep it on?

253
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,084
我说的眼科医生是我们送了免费点心给他的
And by eye doctor, I mean that first-year med student

254
00:11:41,086 --> 00:11:43,636
那个一年级医学生
we gave the free dessert to.

255
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:45,972
难过的日子只有一只眼能看见
A few days, which is a bummer, 'cause only seeing half

256
00:11:45,974 --> 00:11:50,310
也算是种幸福
of how sad we are is kind of a blessing.

257
00:11:50,312 --> 00:11:51,928
我们要怎么找到她们?
How are we gonna find them?

258
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,482
循着我们没落的衬衫生意的气息吗?
Follow the scent of our decaying T-shirts business?

259
00:11:55,484 --> 00:11:58,268
根据Instagram 她们在自助餐厅 看见没?
According to Instagram, they're in the cafeteria, see?

260
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,603
Ashlin刚刚发了一张迷你披萨的照片
Ashlin just posted a pic of a mini-pizza.

261
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:04,324
#披萨生活
#thatpizzalife

262
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:06,943
这里有迷你披萨?
They have mini-pizzas here?

263
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:10,447
我的高中连熟食都没有
My high school didn't even have heat.

264
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,115
抱歉我迟到了 我得去男士服装大卖场
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up a suit

265
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,666
买套西装
at the Men's Warehouse.

266
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:18,004
你说的是"不完全是男士"服装大卖场吗?
Don't you mean the Not Quite A Man's Warehouse?

267
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:21,257
Han 我喜欢你的律师服 很逼真啊
Han, I love your lawyer costume. So authentic.

268
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:24,294
唯一缺少的就是你的灵魂
Only thing missing is the hole where your soul should be.

269
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:26,679
我一直都说 如果你要做某件事...
Well, as I always say, if you're going to do something...

270
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:32,635
用你的左手做 这样就会觉得是别人做的?
Do it with your left hand so it will feel like someone else?

271
00:12:32,637 --> 00:12:36,139
不是 如果你要做某件事 就好好做
No, if you're going to do something, do it right.

272
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:39,476
去年万圣节 我扮演的是"绿巨人"广告里的豌豆芽
Last Halloween, I went as Sprout from the Green Giant commercial

273
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,780
我还把豌豆荚放在我的鸡鸡上
and I even put pea pods over my pee-pee.

274
00:12:43,782 --> 00:12:46,616
你们笑了 但我赢了五百美元
You laugh, but I won $500.

275
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:49,202
好了 我写了份自己的停止不正当竞争的命令
Okay, I created my own Cease and Desist order.

276
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,121
你从哪儿来的这个?
Where did you get this?

277
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:52,655
和Max打印那份假的
Same place Max printed out that fake,

278
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,991
"我没有疱疹"的医生证明是同一个地方
"I don't have herpe" doctor certificate.

279
00:12:54,993 --> 00:12:57,127
还生效了
It works.

280
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,829
这是你的名片
And here's your business card.

281
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,297
哪儿? 在哪儿?
Where? Where is it?

282
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:04,217
我看不见
I can't see.

283
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,837
给你 Han 我希望你是个比Max更好的演员
Here. And Han, I hope you're a better actor than Max.

284
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,342
巨石强森(摔角选手)是个比Max更好的演员
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is a better actor than Max.

285
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,510
鲁诉先生?
Mr. Lu Su?

286
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,511
这就是你想出来的?
That's what you came up with?

287
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,646
鲁诉先生?
Mr. Lu Su?

288
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:21,851
你是个律师 所以"诉"这个字完全符合
Well, you're a lawyer, so the "Su" part is totally on point.

289
00:13:21,853 --> 00:13:23,236
但是鲁诉?
But Lu Su?

290
00:13:23,238 --> 00:13:25,522
从来没有亚洲人叫这个名字的
No Asian was ever named that.

291
00:13:25,524 --> 00:13:27,857
这个星球上也许没有
Maybe not in this galaxy,

292
00:13:27,859 --> 00:13:33,696
但我可以提醒你有个苏鲁先生(星际迷航)
but might I remind you of a Mr. Sulu.

293
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:37,867
没错 我把它重组了 天才啊!
Oh, yeah. I mixed it up. Genius!

294
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:39,669
Han 你不必用这些名片
Han, you don't have to use the cards.

295
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:41,087
我会好好利用的
I can make it work.

296
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:42,922
两年前的万圣节 我扮演的是伊沃克人(星球大战)
Two Halloweens ago, I was an Ewok

297
00:13:42,924 --> 00:13:46,843
然后把橙色的浴巾变成了穆斯林的头巾
and turned an orange bath-towel into a turban.

298
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:49,512
二等奖 奖金250美元
Second place. $250.

299
00:13:49,514 --> 00:13:50,497
明年万圣节的时候 你就能穿着那个
And next Halloween, you can wear that

300
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:53,716
扮成蕾丝边了
and goes as a lesbian minister.

301
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,439
好吧 我们这么办 我们进去
Okay, so the plan is, we go in there

302
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,524
和我们的律师一起 冷静地和她们对质
and calmly confront them with our attorney.

303
00:14:01,526 --> 00:14:02,892
我来负责说话
I'll do the talking.

304
00:14:02,894 --> 00:14:05,028
Han 你站着 装作你很聪明就可以了
Han, you stand there and try to look smart.

305
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,533
啊 我是个亚洲人 所以这事已经搞定了
Ah. I'm already Asian. So, done.

306
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:16,456
哇 这让我想起了过去
Wow, this brings me back.

307
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,292
我曾和校园风云人物 辩论队
I had a seat at the popular table, the Debate Team table,

308
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:20,577
学生会的人
the Student Council table,

309
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,579
还有一起等结婚的人坐过一桌
and the Waiting For Marriage table.

310
00:14:22,581 --> 00:14:23,913
但是那一桌后来就散了
But that table kind of fell apart

311
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:26,299
因为除了我以外 所有人都怀孕了
when everybody got pregnant but me.

312
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:30,086
我和一个酒鬼在学校的停车场里一起吃饭
I ate in the school parking lot with a wino.

313
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:33,306
他对我非常好 我还以为他可能是我爸呢
He was so nice to me, I thought he might be my dad.

314
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:34,757
但他一直没有对我动手动脚
But then he never made a move on me,

315
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,976
所以看来他不是
so I guess he wasn't.

316
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:39,095
各位注意一下
Attention everyone, attention.

317
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:42,232
是啊 各位注意一下
Yeah, attention everyone, attention.

318
00:14:42,234 --> 00:14:45,318
Ashilin和我今天来卖我们的T恤衫
Ashlin and I are here today to sell our T-shirts

319
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,571
并告诉你们 欺负人是件很不好的事
and to talk about bullying and how it's not cool.

320
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:49,989
太不好了
It's so not cool.

321
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,991
我在说话呢 Ash
I was talking, Ash.

322
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:55,111
是啊 她在说话呢
Yeah, she was talking.

323
00:14:55,113 --> 00:14:57,614
她们是为校园欺凌筹钱?
Their charity is bullying?

324
00:14:57,616 --> 00:15:02,785
这就好像坎耶・维斯特为低调而筹钱一样
That's like Kanye West trying to raise money for laying low.

325
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:05,755
每买一件我们的超可爱T恤
A $3 donation will be made to our anti-bullying fund

326
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:08,791
就会给我们的反校园欺凌基金捐款3美元
with each purchase of one of our super, super cute tees.

327
00:15:08,793 --> 00:15:11,461
超级 超级可爱的T恤
Super, super cute tees.

328
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:13,513
这是我的超可爱T恤!
My super cute tee!

329
00:15:13,515 --> 00:15:15,265
那是我这辈子最好的主意
Best idea I ever had.

330
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:17,350
还有就是一个下巴带
Right up there with the bong with a chin strap

331
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:20,970
可以让你把手空出来换台
so you could be hands-free to change the channel.

332
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:23,640
赶紧买一件T恤吧 我们马上回来
So buy a shirt right now and then we'll be back later

333
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,942
继续我们的反校园欺凌演讲
for the rest of the anti-bully talk.

334
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:27,977
是啊 你们要是不买
Yeah, buy them or my dad won't pay

335
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:30,613
我爸爸今年就不给大家买长曲棍球装备了
for the lacrosse equipment this year.

336
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:36,986
我们走 他们在利用我们赚大钱
Let's go. They are making a fortune on us.

337
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:41,040
如果我要被人搞 那最好也是21岁以上的人
And if I'm gonna get screwed, it better be by someone over 21.

338
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:44,327
是啊 这好像只需要两杯酒就可以搞定了
Yeah, that sounds like a job with a two drink minimum.

339
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:48,498
Han 别把这事搞砸了 否则就让你把这眼镜吃了
Han, don't mess this up or you'll be eating those glasses.

340
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,218
你想要反校园欺凌的小册子吗?
Might I interest you in an anti-bullying pamphlet?

341
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,171
你想坐在我的手指上吗?
Might I interest you in a seat on my finger?

342
00:15:55,173 --> 00:15:57,724
嘿 你们两个怎么进来的?
Hey, how did you two get in here?

343
00:15:57,726 --> 00:16:00,176
学校花钱请了门卫 不放流浪汉进来呢
The school pays guards out front to keep out the homeless.

344
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:02,061
是啊 真好笑
Yeah, well, jokes on you.

345
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:05,231
因为他们刚刚就直接让我们走进来了
'Cause they just let us walk in.

346
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,684
你们好啊 小姑娘 你们可以停止
Hello, girls. You can "Cease and Desis"

347
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:09,686
售卖我们的T恤了
selling our T-shirts as of now.

348
00:16:09,688 --> 00:16:11,688
这是我们的律师 他叫...
This is our attorney, Mr....

349
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,239
鲁诉先生
Lu Su.

350
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,408
他手里拿着我们的禁止令
And he is holding our Cease and Desist

351
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,028
来回应你们的禁止令
to counter your Cease and Desist.

352
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,247
好吧 首先 你们的律师看上去像个
Okay, well, first, your lawyer looks like a teacher

353
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:23,866
迪士尼里的老师
on a Disney show.

354
00:16:23,868 --> 00:16:26,919
这不好吗?
Is that a bad thing?

355
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:28,338
如果你们还想说什么的话
And if you have anything further to say,

356
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,540
你们可以去找我的律师 也就是她爸爸
you can take it up with my lawyer. Her dad.

357
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,342
他真的很厉害
And he's real good.

358
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:35,845
他用了技术手段帮一个承认自己杀了他全家的
He got that CEO guy who admitted he killed his whole family

359
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:38,348
首席执行官脱了罪
out on a technicality.

360
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,216
我忘了女孩们能有多恶毒了
I forgot how mean girls can be.

361
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:43,102
这怎么会? 我可是你室友啊
How? I'm your roommate.

362
00:16:43,104 --> 00:16:45,888
谢谢你 Kemberly 谢谢 Ashilin
Thank you, Kemberly. Thank you, Ashlin.

363
00:16:49,394 --> 00:16:50,476
能帮帮忙吗
A little help.

364
00:16:56,568 --> 00:17:00,069
姑娘们 你们好 你们看上去人挺好的
Hello, girls, you all look very nice.

365
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,954
他在干什么?
What is he doing?

366
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:05,642
希望他干得漂亮点 然后就能吸引到人给来个头条
Hopefully a tight ten and then he'll bring up the headliner.

367
00:17:05,644 --> 00:17:07,577
也许看着我 穿着这么帅气的西装
This may be hard to believe, looking at me

368
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,462
会很难相信
in this totally awesome suit,

369
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:12,465
我比较了解被欺负的感受
but I know a little something about being bullied.

370
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:13,883
当我还是小孩的时候...
As a little child...

371
00:17:13,885 --> 00:17:16,586
还是一个稍微大一点的成人
And as a slightly bigger adult.

372
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:19,889
你怎么这样? 他在进行校园欺凌演讲 你还要欺负他?
Seriously? In the middle of his bullying speech, you're bullying?

373
00:17:19,891 --> 00:17:23,309
我自己都有点吃惊
Kind of surprised even myself.

374
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,311
有人欺负我
I have someone who bullies me.

375
00:17:25,313 --> 00:17:28,231
好吧 趁来得及我们先出去
Okay, let's get out of here while I can.

376
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:30,817
这不仅仅是打我和叫外号
It's not just the hitting and the name-calling.

377
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,936
虽然 说实话 这很令人沮丧
Although, not gonna lie, that's a real bummer.

378
00:17:33,938 --> 00:17:37,106
但你们看 姑娘们 被欺负的坏处在于
You see, girls, the bad thing about being bullied

379
00:17:37,108 --> 00:17:41,160
你每一次被欺负 生命的一小部分
is that every time it happens, it steals a little piece

380
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:42,745
就会被偷走
of who you are.

381
00:17:42,747 --> 00:17:46,616
反复多次之后 一点一点的
And then, if it happens enough, little by little,

382
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:51,504
你就会变得不如你能成为的那种人
you become just a little less of who you were meant to be.

383
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,256
而这很不好
And that's not cool.

384
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,425
这里的两个女孩虽然还没意识到 但我相信
And these two girls up here, without knowing it, I'm sure,

385
00:17:55,427 --> 00:17:58,928
她们在偷走Max和Caroline的创意时
stole a little piece of Max and Caroline.

386
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,631
也偷走了她们生命中的一小部分东西
when they stole their little idea.

387
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:04,100
而那也很不好
And that's so not cool.

388
00:18:04,102 --> 00:18:07,270
是啊 那太不好了
Yeah, that's so not cool.

389
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:09,972
Max 还有Caroline 我们不会再做这些衬衫了
Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.

390
00:18:09,974 --> 00:18:11,474
Ash 我可没这么说过
Ash, I never said that.

391
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:14,143
不 Kemberly 我说了
Ah, no, Kemberly. I did.

392
00:18:14,145 --> 00:18:16,979
而且我更喜欢接受胃束带手术之前的你
And I liked you more before the lap-band.

393
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,499
当时你的名字还是带I的Kimberly
When you were still Kimberly with an "I."

394
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:34,664
Max 刚刚Han是不是救了我们?
Max, did Han just save us?

395
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,466
我没在听 我忙着把小披萨
I wasn't listening, I was putting mini-pizzas

396
00:18:36,468 --> 00:18:38,084
偷装进口袋呢
in my pocket.

397
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:49,395
姑娘们 你们四十分钟之前就该开始上班了
Girls, your shift started 40 minutes ago.

398
00:18:49,397 --> 00:18:53,649
你们那么早来干什么?
What are you doing here so early?

399
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,486
Earl 我们有好消息 现在我们是
Earl, good news. We are now the sole owners

400
00:18:56,488 --> 00:18:58,654
纸杯蛋糕T恤的唯一销售商了
of all those cupcake T-shirts.

401
00:18:58,656 --> 00:19:01,574
我们也没别的东西了
And, literally, nothing else.

402
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,659
也许我可以租一只鹦鹉 然后去
Maybe I could rent a parrot and pick up some shifts

403
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:06,028
梅因餐馆上几天班
at Long John Silver's.

404
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,530
嘿 姑娘们
Hey, girls.

405
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:09,532
我马上就要见一个新的婚礼策划了
I'm about to meet another wedding planner.

406
00:19:09,534 --> 00:19:11,701
这个人会很棒的!
And this one's gonna be good!

407
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:14,871
他是同性恋
He's gay.

408
00:19:14,873 --> 00:19:16,756
Sophie Kuchenski吗?
Sophie Kuchenski?

409
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,041
是啊 天啊!
Yes, God!

410
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,344
我刚走进这里 我就对自己说
From the second I walked in here, I said to myself,

411
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:23,846
"那肯定是她" 我看得出来
"That has to be her." And I can see it.

412
00:19:23,848 --> 00:19:29,235
我们要一起创造魔法了
We're going to make magic together.

413
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:33,890
是啊 同性恋怎么说不?
Yeah, what's gay for no?

414
00:19:33,892 --> 00:19:37,443
好吧
Okay.

415
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:41,597
哇 我感觉我们刚刚经历了一场"同卷风"
Wow, I think we just survived a "Torgaydo""

416
00:19:43,701 --> 00:19:47,236
我现在在纽约去哪里再找一个同性恋
Where am I gonna find another gay wedding planner

417
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:51,908
婚礼策划啊?
in New York now?

418
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,409
在Crate & Barrel家装店发一次脾气
Just throw a tantrum in a Crate & Barrel,

419
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:58,798
就会有五个跑着过来了
and five of them will come running.

420
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,584
嘿 今天法律工作干得不错
Hey, nice legal work today.

421
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:05,388
你都能上儿童法庭了
You should be on the Little People's Court.

422
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,642
是啊 从现在开始 我要叫你Han大律师了
Yeah, from now on, I'm calling you "Hanny Cochran""

423
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,761
好吧 下次你们想感谢我
Okay. Next time you want to thank me,

424
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:14,146
就给我送一份爱蒂宝甜点吧
just send me an Edible Arrangement.

425
00:20:14,148 --> 00:20:17,650
我都不知道暗示你们多少次了
I don't know many times I have to drop that hint.

426
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:23,239
但那就好像是个两英寸的暗示了
But that's just, like, a two-inch drop.

427
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:25,608
对不起 我忍不住
Sorry. I can't help myself.

428
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,611
但我还是想问问看 因为我知道我就是
But I'm going to try because I know I was the bully

429
00:20:28,613 --> 00:20:30,997
你在那个演讲里说的那个欺负你的人
you were talking about in that speech.

430
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:34,784
什么? 我说的是我那栋大楼的门房
What? I was talking about the doorwoman in my building.

431
00:20:34,786 --> 00:20:35,918
我每次要拿邮件
I have to submit to a purple-nurple

432
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,755
都得被揪奶头
just to get my mail.

433
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:41,958
你还有别的女人?
There's another woman?

434
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,578
Max 我觉得Han有个二房
Max, I think Han has a side bully.
428 

435
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,797
好吧 那看来我得更努力了
Well, I'll just have to try harder.

436
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,516
因为如果有人要揪你的奶头
Because if anyone is gonna mercilessly nurple you

437
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:54,804
那也得是我
into an early grave, it's got to be me.

438
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:57,306
我也想这样 Max
I'd like to think so, Max.

439
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:01,994
你还想坐车头朝前的车呢
You'd also like to ride in a car facing forwards.

440
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:05,031
又是老样子
Back to normal.
