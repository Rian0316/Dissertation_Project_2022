1
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:24,064
噢 你好像刚参加完一场婚礼
Oh, you look like you're coming from a wedding.

2
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,432
是一场很棒的婚礼吗
Was it a nice one?

3
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:29,820
额 这个故事有点长 我不想太没礼貌
Uh, it's a long story, and I don't mean to be rude,

4
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,523
但我真的很不想讲这个故事
but I really don't feel like talking about it.

5
00:00:34,742 --> 00:00:37,611
这一切都开始于新娘要见我
It all started when the bride asked to see me...

6
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,615
哇哦
Wow.

7
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:44,201
好了 别敷衍我了 莫斯比
Okay, don't sugarcoat it, Mosby.

8
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:46,537
直说吧 好吗
Just give it to me straight, okay?

9
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,171
巴尼现在被吓成什么样了
How bad is Barney freaking out right now?

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,823
哦 他挺好的
Oh, he's fine.

11
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:51,658
说真的 他真的挺好的
No, I'm serious. He's totally fine.

12
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,176
我家里有条更好的领带
I have a better tie at home!

13
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,344
是菊蓝色的
It's cornflower blue!

14
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,796
是矢车菊蓝色的啊
It's cornflower blue!

15
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:59,550
你放心吧 巴尼?斯丁森绝绝对对的
You may rest assured, Barney Stinson is absolutely 100%

16
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:00,801
能撑的过去这场婚礼
going through with this wedding.

17
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:02,719
好吧
Okay.

18
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:05,339
这是好消息
Good news.

19
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,508
额 只是有个小小的问题
Um, just one small issue, uh...

20
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,395
我撑不过去
I can't go through with this wedding.

冷静下 每个人在他们结婚那天
Okay, calm down, everyone feels this way

25
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:27,794
都会有这样的感觉
on their wedding day.

26
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,029
都会过去的
It'll pass.

27
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:29,997
不 它越来越厉害了
No.It's more than that.

28
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,882
我有个很严肃的问题
I'm having a serious crisis.

29
00:01:33,534 --> 00:01:36,887
我在想爬出这个窗户是不是很难
And I wonder if it would be hard to climb out that window.

30
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,472
嗯 爬出去简单
Uh, climbing out's easy.

31
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,507
爬进来才是真正的挑战
Climbing in's the real challenge.

32
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:41,925
哦 对了
Oh, right.

33
00:01:41,927 --> 00:01:43,226
这是同一个窗户是吧
It's the same window, isn't it?

34
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,544
是的
Yeah.

35
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:47,481
那个故事发生在2012年5月
That story transpired in May of 2012.

36
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,901
来回忆一下 莉莉和马修灰常的开心
As you may recall, Lily and Marshall were gloriously happy

37
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,236
开心他们刚刚迎来你们的哥哥马尔文
having just welcomed your cousin Marvin.

38
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,222
巴尼和奎恩也灰常的开心
While Barney and Quinn were gloriously happy

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,909
开心他们刚刚订婚了
having just gotten engaged.

40
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,194
还有罗宾 好吧
And Robin, well...

41
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,579
啊 抠到了
Ah, got it!

42
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,066
天啊 这个小贱货从早餐起就在这里了
Man, that sum'bitch had been in there since breakfast!

43
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:09,086
罗宾对阵罂粟籽 一比零
Robin one, poppy seed: zero.

44
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,236
见鬼 要来点香槟了
Heck, this calls for some champagne.

45
00:02:10,238 --> 00:02:11,338
好像冰箱里有一些
I think there's some in the fridge.

46
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,572
我们去拿
We'll get it.

47
00:02:12,574 --> 00:02:14,741
我们一定不会在厨房里爱爱的
We're totally not gonna go have sex in the kitchen,

48
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:15,842
正如你们所想的那样
if that's what you're thinking.

49
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:16,877
啊 我们不要?
Aw, we're not?

50
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,078
不 我们当然要了 我已经把你的胸罩脱掉了
No, no, we are. I already took off your bra.

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,546
好吧
Oh!

52
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,550
喂 你们俩确定你们还能来点香槟
Hey, are you guys sure you can handle champagne?

53
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,469
你们好像一周左右都没有睡觉了
You haven't slept in like a week.

54
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:26,853
虽然才是一晚上
We should just call it a night.

55
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,805
哦 我知道这是为什么了
Oh, I see what this is about.

56
00:02:28,807 --> 00:02:31,308
巴尼订婚了你觉得很怪
You feel weird because Barney's engaged.

57
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,275
你说啥
What?!

58
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,810
不 当然不了
No. Of course not.

59
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:35,762
我来告诉你为什么不觉得怪
And I will tell you why it's not weird.

60
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:36,780
什么不觉得怪
What's not weird?

61
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,098
巴尼订婚的事实
The fact that Barney's engaged.

62
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,116
巴尼订婚了?!
Barney's engaged?!

63
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,317
见鬼 要来点香槟了
Heck, this calls for some champagne.

64
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,785
我觉得冰箱里有一些
I think there's some in the fridge.

65
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:43,453
我的天哪 你们俩为什么就是不承认
Oh, my God, why don't you both just admit it:

66
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,740
你们已经完全精疲力尽了
You're deliriously exhausted.

67
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:48,208
我们好好的
We're fine!

68
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,943
真的吗 
Really?

69
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,495
我们才不会成为那种一有了孩子
 We're not gonna be the kind of people who have a baby

70
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,279
就完全变成僵尸的人
and become total zombies.

71
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,381
是啊 罗宾
Yes, Robin.

72
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:56,449
我们才不会成为那种
We're not gonna be the kind of people

73
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,085
一旦有了僵尸 就完全变成孩子的人
that have a zombie and become total babies.

74
00:02:58,087 --> 00:03:00,087
好吧 我想说的是...
Okay, well, what the I was saying is...

75
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,680
你们明白了吗
Do you understand?

76
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:12,149
明白 绝对的明白
Yes! God, yes!

77
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:14,300
你不用多费口舌了 妹子
You are preaching to the choir, sister.

78
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:16,302
喔
Whew!

79
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,938
-喂  -所以
-Hey. -So...

80
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,108
我正在想我的婚礼
I am thinking about my bridal party

81
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,610
嗯 我没有很多女性朋友
and, uh, I don't have a lot of girlfriends.

82
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:25,112
我的意思是 我有工作上的朋友
I mean, I have work friends,

83
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:26,029
但是我在脱衣舞俱乐部工作
but I worked at a strip club

84
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,647
我知道她们一定会抱怨
and I know they'll just complain

85
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:30,917
伴娘礼服露得太少了 所以
about any bridesmaid's dress that has a front, so...

86
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,003
你们愿不愿意做我的伴娘
Would you guys be my bridesmaids?

87
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:35,038
愿意 我好荣幸
I'd be honored. Yes!

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,540
不包括你 马修
Not you, Marshall.

89
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:38,425
但是 耶 谢谢
But, yay, thank you! Oh.

90
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,459
-谢谢  -天哪
-Oh, thank you. -Oh, my gosh.

91
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:41,378
一定会好有爱的
It's gonna be so much fun.

92
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,164
好吧 现在觉得怪了
Yeah, now it's weird.

93
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,515
什么觉得怪
What's weird?

94
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,968
我 当奎恩的伴娘
Me being Quinn's bridesmaid.

95
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,137
我一点也不担心 亲爱的
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, sweetie.

96
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,521
她可能都不会邀请你呢
She probably won't even ask you.

97
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,556
她刚刚才邀请我
She just did.

98
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,007
我们俩都答应了
And we both said yes.

99
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,860
见鬼 要来点香槟了
Heck, this calls for some champagne.

100
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,012
我觉得冰箱里还有一些
I think there's some in the fridge.

101
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:01,565
与此同时 我也非常的开心
Meanwhile, I was also gloriously happy,

102
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,784
和维多利亚向落日驶去
Driving off into the sunset with Victoria,

103
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,787
她为我在圣坛上抛下了她的未婚夫克劳斯
Who left her fiance Klaus at the altar for me.

104
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:08,188
但还是有一个问题
There was just one problem.

105
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,690
我想知道克劳斯现在有没有看到你的字条
I wonder if Klaus found your note yet.

106
00:04:10,692 --> 00:04:11,691
我的字条
My note?

107
00:04:11,693 --> 00:04:12,859
是啊 就像
Yeah, you know,

108
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:15,045
我要离开你了 之类的字条
The "I'm leaving you at the altar" Note.

109
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:16,296
那很重要吗
Is that a thing?

110
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,700
当你在圣坛前抛弃某人 你总得留一张字条
When you leave someone at the altar, you always leave a note.

111
00:04:20,702 --> 00:04:22,002
这是基本的礼节嘛
It's common courtesy.

112
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:25,088
我认为这基本礼节已经在我从那扇窗户那里跑出去的时候消失了
I think common courtesy went out the window when I did.

113
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,808
你看 当斯黛拉在圣坛抛弃我的时候
Look, when Stella left me at the altar,

114
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,375
至少我还得到了一个解释
At least I got an explanation.

115
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,378
我是说 那张字条让你保持理智
I mean, that note is what keeps you sane.

116
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,682
你读一遍 再读一遍 你把上面的内容记得清清楚楚
You read it, you re-read it, you memorize it,

117
00:04:35,684 --> 00:04:38,318
你把字条放在身边入睡 你闻着它
You sleep with it, you sniff it

118
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,770
因为那张字条还有一些她的的味道
Because it still kind of smells like her,

119
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:41,104
到最后
And then, finally...

120
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:42,906
你放手了（也有扔出去的意思）
You let it go...

121
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,908
把它绑在板砖上 直接扔向
Tied to a brick, right through her perfect

122
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,559
她郊区小屋的玻璃上
Little suburban bay window.

123
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:48,612
好吧 我现在就给他发短信
I'll just text him.

124
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:50,580
你必须要留字条
You're leaving a note.

125
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,234
现在 巴尼和我
So, Barney and I have already disagreed

126
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:55,669
在一些婚礼细节上有些分歧
On a few of the wedding details.

127
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,504
我想在婚礼上搞自助餐
I want to go with a buffet,

128
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,290
但他想在婚礼上骑着灰熊过走道
And he wants to ride down the aisle on a grizzly bear.

129
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,459
它会穿礼服的
He'll be wearing a tux.

130
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,762
好吧 好吧 为了你我就改骑熊猫吧
Fine, fine, I'll settle for a panda bear,

131
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,247
但是必须要你给我的裁缝打电话
But you have to call my tailor.

132
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,082
他一定会因为这次改动非常生气的
He'll be furious about the switch.

133
00:05:09,084 --> 00:05:11,151
嘿 巴尼 那个
 Hey, Barney, uh...

134
00:05:11,153 --> 00:05:12,469
我们需要谈一谈
We've gotta talk.

135
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:16,139
那个 奎恩刚刚邀请我做她的伴娘
Um, Quinn just asked me to be one of her bridesmaids.

136
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:17,257
她甚至一点都不认为
Isn't she even a little

137
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,975
我们曾经约会过而感到别扭
weirded out that you and I used to date?

138
00:05:18,977 --> 00:05:22,062
奎恩的字典里根本就没有嫉妒这个词
Quinn doesn't have a jealous bone in her body.

139
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,446
她逆来顺受
She rolls with the punches.

140
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,532
-她... -根本不知道
-She... -Doesn't have a clue.

141
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,167
的确 她不知道
No, she does not.

142
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:28,702
写好了
Okay.

143
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:30,770
好
Okay.

144
00:05:30,772 --> 00:05:33,206
克劳斯 我真的很难用语言描述
"Klaus, there is no easy way to tell you

145
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,108
我今天不能嫁给你的原因
Why I won't be marrying you today.

146
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,111
祝你夏天愉快 维多利亚
Have a great summer, Victoria."

147
00:05:38,113 --> 00:05:39,946
就这点
That's it?

148
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,448
不 不行 我们要把这件事情办好
No, no, we gotta do this right.

149
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,217
但 这个不能你写啊
Well, you can't write it.

150
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,003
瞄一眼就知道 这明显是男人的笔迹（泰德以前学过花体字）
One look, it's gonna be obvious it's a guy's handwri...

151
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:49,139
哦 好吧 现在没事了
Oh no, we're good.

152
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,008
好吧 好吧 你写 我提意见
Okay, fine, you write, I'll advise.

153
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:54,928
克劳斯
"Klaus."

154
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,096
你就直呼其名么
Just "Klaus"?

155
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:57,931
别闹了 有点爱心 这家伙已经很可怜了
Come on, give it some heart, the poor guy.

156
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:01,101
亲爱的克劳斯
"Dear sweet Klaus..."

157
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:02,769
亲爱的 怎么 你还爱着那个混蛋
"Sweet?" What, are you still in love with this jerk?

158
00:06:02,771 --> 00:06:04,688
我自个写
I'm doing this on my own.

159
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,809
对不起 我就是
I'm sorry, I just...

160
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:12,112
就是 为这个家伙感到抱歉
You know, I feel bad for the guy.

161
00:06:12,114 --> 00:06:15,148
我正在从他身边抢走这个世界上最完美的女人
I'm stealing the greatest girl in the world away from him.

162
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,868
不是你抢走了我
You're not stealing me.

163
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,870
是我选择了你
I'm choosing you.

164
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:27,794
因为你爱我
Because you are loving

165
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:30,380
你关心我
And you are caring...

166
00:06:30,382 --> 00:06:33,266
并且 你要把这张字条送过去
And you are going to go deliver this note.

167
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,968
等等 你想让我送过去
Wait, you want me to go in there?

168
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:37,971
今天 我放弃了所有
It took everything I had to climb out

169
00:06:37,973 --> 00:06:39,222
从那个教堂的窗户爬出来
That church window today.

170
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:42,642
但 如果我就这样回去了
And if I have to go back in there,

171
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:45,395
我不确定我会再走出来
I'm not sure I can do it again.

172
00:06:57,158 --> 00:06:58,825
这样会让字条闻起来有你的味道
It has to smell like you.

173
00:07:03,986 --> 00:07:07,229
所以 奎恩一点也不知道我们曾约会过
So Quinn has no idea that we used to date?

174
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,478
一点也不知道
None whatsoever.

175
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,447
好吧 巴尼 你想想
Okay, Barney, think this through.

176
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:11,569
你真的想
Do you really want to

177
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,483
在你和奎恩的生活里...
spend the rest of your life with Quinn...

178
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:14,600
哦 天啊 你说到点上了
Oh, God, you have a point.

179
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,619
还没呢
Haven't gotten to it yet.

180
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,122
好的 继续
Of course. Continue.

181
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:21,791
你真的想要和奎恩共度余生
Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with Quinn

182
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:23,109
并隐藏这个秘密
And keep this secret?

183
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,628
我的意思是说 她会发现的
I mean, she's gonna find out.

184
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,880
奎恩不会发现的 因为我把它们都销毁了
Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed

185
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:29,499
你和我曾在一起的时候所有的证据
Every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.

186
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:30,917
这也太扯了吧
That's ridiculous.

187
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,003
你不可能把它们全都销毁了
You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.

188
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,294
你用一张老虎的照片代替了我
You replaced me with a tiger.

189
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:42,962
我不能把你完全P掉
I couldn't completely get you out of that one.

190
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:44,180
我就只能自己创造一些了
Had to get creative.

191
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:48,301
好吧 很高兴你把我们在一起的整个时光都给删除了
Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together

192
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:49,802
这个对你来说这个太容易了
Was so easy for you.

193
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,689
但是我向你保证 奎恩总会发现的
But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.

194
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:53,940
不 她不会的
No, she won't.

195
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,191
但我需要你的帮助
I just need your help.

196
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,326
我也需要你们两个人的帮助
Yours, too.

197
00:07:56,328 --> 00:07:57,477
我知道你们两个和这件事情没有关系
I know you're out of it,

198
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,362
但是你要向我保证 绝对不告诉奎恩
But you have to promise not to tell Quinn, okay?

199
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:00,780
告诉她什么
Tell Quinn what?

200
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:01,814
回答正确
Exactly.

201
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:03,149
不 她真的在问你 没有装傻
No, she's really asking.

202
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,305
-哥没法爬下水道 -为啥
-Can't climb the drainpipe. -What?

203
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,173
四年级时，我在体育课上
When I was in fourth grade, I couldn't climb the rope

204
00:08:27,175 --> 00:08:29,025
没爬上绳子 然后所有同学都取笑我
in gym class and all the other kids made fun of me,

205
00:08:29,027 --> 00:08:30,360
再说那也不是我的错
even though it wasn't my fault.

206
00:08:30,362 --> 00:08:32,479
我要在阿三后面爬上去
I had to go after Efthimios Papajapoulos.

207
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:34,397
而那时绳子上已经沾满了羊油
The rope was slick with lamb grease!

208
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,517
好吧 那走正门啊
Okay, so just walk in the front door

209
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,618
就像那是你家
and act like you belong.

210
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,685
拿好
Here.

211
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,237
这是换衣间的钥匙
Here's the key to the dressing room.

212
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,696
你想干啥
Can I help you?

213
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,083
我是教堂里打杂的
Hi. I'm the church handyman.

214
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,585
这里有东西坏了要我修
I'm here to fix the broken thing.

215
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:56,536
它爆掉了
It's busted.

216
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:58,922
新娘要打个小盹
The bride is taking a "Schnooze."

217
00:08:58,924 --> 00:09:01,925
她让我看着 不希望任何人打扰到她
She asked me to stand watch so that no one disturbs her.

218
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,410
我会很快的
I'll be quick.

219
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:04,644
那你也会死的很快的
You will be dead.

220
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:06,563
姐以前是在莱比锡玩摔跤的
I used to wrestle in Leipzig.

221
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:07,647
算了
You know what?

222
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,598
字条什么的挺多余的
A note's redundant.

223
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,066
你不在 他懂的
You're not there. He gets it.

224
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,602
不行 你说得对 我必须得留张字条
No, you were right, I have to leave a note.

225
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:13,686
这是基本礼节啊
It's common courtesy.

226
00:09:13,688 --> 00:09:15,405
好吧 那也不可能啊
Well, it's not gonna be possible

227
00:09:15,407 --> 00:09:17,657
有个熊腰虎背的女门神杵在那里
with Andrea the Giant standing guard up there.

228
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,609
噢 对 克劳斯的妹妹
Oh, right, Klaus's sister.

229
00:09:19,611 --> 00:09:21,261
巴尼在就好了
It's too bad Barney's not here.

230
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:23,747
这男人就是为了伴娘们而存在的
Man, he lives for bridesmaids.

231
00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:25,198
是啊 不在啊
Right, but he's not.

232
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,733
再说了 他也做不到靠打电话就能色诱妹子啊
And it's not like he could seduce Uta over the phone.

233
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,004
接受挑战
Challenge accepted!

234
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:33,106
如果就只是电话的话就不算偷腥了对吧
Honey, it's not cheating if it's on the phone, right?

235
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,073
你刚说了什么
Say what now?

236
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:35,074
奎恩同意了
Quinn's on board!

237
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:36,092
把她手机号发我
Text me her number!

238
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:40,013
你个猥琐的下流胚
You filthy, disgusting man!

239
00:09:40,015 --> 00:09:43,916
不过好吧 你说的东西我还是会照做的
But yes, I will do that to myself at your instruction.

240
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:45,769
先让我找到储藏室
Let me find a broom closet.

241
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,190
嗯 是 很好
Oh, ja, good.

242
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,370
我成功了 成功了
I did it. I did it!

243
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,622
你太神奇了
You're amazing.

244
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,273
我们走吧
Let's get out of here.

245
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,830
我把车钥匙落换衣间里了
I left the car keys in the dressing room.

246
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,467
而且我一关上门它就自己锁掉了
Pretty sure the door locked behind me.

247
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,623
天啊 额滴神啊 
Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God...

248
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:26,009
巴尼认为我不能保守秘密
I found it kind of insulting that Barney doesn't

249
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:27,760
他也太看不起我了
think we can keep this secret.

250
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:30,897
我是说 没错 马尔文整得我们整夜睡不了
I mean, yeah, Marvin's keeping us up all night.

251
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,317
但是他依旧是全城最美的女孩子
But he's still the prettiest little girl in the city.

252
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,904
亲爱的你知道你刚刚说了什么吗
Baby, did you just hear yourself?

253
00:10:37,906 --> 00:10:41,474
你说全城最漂亮的女孩子
You said, "Prettiest little girl in the city."

254
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:42,859
应该是全国才对哈
I think you meant "Country""

255
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,944
嗯嗯
Yeah.

256
00:10:44,946 --> 00:10:46,579
我说 巴尼他怎么想的
I mean, what does Barney think?

257
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:48,364
好像我们马上就要抖出他之前
We're just gonna blurt out that he used to date...

258
00:10:48,366 --> 00:10:49,616
嘘
Shh!

259
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:53,486
我去 那个好险啊
Oh... that was close.

260
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,154
奎恩有可能会通过这玩意儿听见的
Quinn could've heard us through the...

261
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:57,957
真及时
Good catch!

262
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,711
我刚刚差点就要把巴尼和罗宾好过那档子事抖出来了
I almost just blurted out that Barney used to date Robin!

263
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,046
巴尼之前真把过罗宾
Barney used to date Robin?!

264
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:07,934
你啥时候进来的
When did you get in here?

265
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:10,019
在十分钟前 你们说
Like, ten minutes ago when you said,

266
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,856
奎恩 咱们去小马尔文的房间里玩吧
"Hey Quinn, let's all go hang out in Marvin's room."

267
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:16,842
再会 小姐
Auf wiedersehen, fraulein.

268
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:18,978
听我说 我是讨厌把人物模式化
You know, I hate to perpetuate the stereotype,

269
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,483
但来自德国萨克森州的女摔跤手就是那么的典型
but German female wrestlers from Saxony are just begging for it.

270
00:11:23,485 --> 00:11:24,684
你泡过罗宾吗
You dated Robin?

271
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:27,403
艹
Verdammt!

272
00:11:31,813 --> 00:11:33,914
抱歉我说了谎 我会告诉你所有的事 
I'm sorry I lied to you. I'll tell you everything

273
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,360
-整个故事    -好 在我走去这扇门之前
-The whole story. -Fine. You have one minute

274
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,728
你有一分钟的时间
before I walk out that door.

275
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,415
这个 故事有点略长啊 奎恩
Um, it's, uh, kind of a long story, Quinn.

276
00:11:40,417 --> 00:11:42,033
得用不止一分钟了
Gonna take a bit little longer than a minute.

277
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,768
还剩52秒
52 seconds.

278
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,753
七年前 马修莉莉初订婚
Seven years ago, when Marshall and Lily got engaged,

279
00:11:45,755 --> 00:11:47,922
泰德人群之中遇罗宾  -我曰 善 乃识其窈窕欲炮之
Ted saw Robin across a crowded room, and I said, "Oh, yeah,

280
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:49,707
然泰爱慕之心如金石
you just know she likes it dirty," But Ted really liked her

281
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,209
遂举 否遇泰耶
so we played "Have you met Ted?"

282
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,927
二人遂共进晚餐 泰送罗返 是当吻别
They went to dinner, he walked her home, shoulda kissed her,

283
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,579
未然 恶也 后泰窃其青号 返
didn't-- lame-- so he stole a smurf penis, went back

284
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,847
当吻 未然 恶
to her place, should've kissed her, didn't-- lame.

285
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,415
泰举盛会三 终吻于舍顶
He threw three parties, they kissed on the roof,

286
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:58,800
然未正道也 大恶
but decided to be friends-- lame--

287
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,218
一日 泰欲携罗共赴友之大婚
then Ted wanted to take Robin to a wedding,

288
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,686
罗未至 泰独往而识维
she couldn't go, he went alone and met Victoria,

289
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,304
然亦未吻之 噫 泰德者 卢瑟也
didn't kiss her either-- lame-- not a great closer, Ted--

290
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,256
然泰终如愿 始正道
but he finally kissed her, they started dating,

291
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,225
维往德意志 泰吻罗 甩维
she went to Germany, Ted kissed Robin, lost Victoria,

292
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,277
泰行祈雨舞 得罗 然终分
Ted did a rain dance, got Robin, Ted and Robin broke up,

293
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,112
罗徙南美 与一拉丁渣渣返
Robin moved to Brazil, came back with a Latin stud,

294
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:13,097
泰妒 纹一媚记 虽未与主线关联
Ted got jealous, got a tramp stamp, not really relevant

295
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,482
然多多益善乎
to the story I just like mentioning that

296
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,284
吾炮罗 泰割席
as much as possible, I hooked up with Robin, Ted and I stopped

297
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:18,102
泰遇车祸 遂重和
being friends, Ted got hit by a bus, we made up...

298
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,406
吾始追罗 吾长肉千斤 罗恢恢疑秃
Robin and I started dating, I got fat, her hair fell out.

299
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,874
吾分 罗与唐甚密 吾追诺
We broke up, Robin dated Don, I dated Nora,

300
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,075
与罗红杏出墙 遂弃诺
cheated on her with Robin, I dumped Nora,

301
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,410
罗与凯甚欢 然好景不长
Robin dated Kevin, but not for long,

302
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,411
后吾识汝于佾 汝得吾祖上之手表
and then I met you and you took my grandpa's watch

303
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,829
然爱慕之心不可控也
but I fell in love with you anyway,

304
00:12:27,831 --> 00:12:29,163
汝准放气于厅堂 吾求婚
and you let me fart in front of you and I asked you to marry me

305
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,781
汝准 后往马府探新生
and you said yes and we came over here to meet little Marvin

306
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,133
以上
and that's everything!

307
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:34,836
哦 对了 我参加价格猜猜猜赢了个甲壳虫车子哟
Also I went on the Price Is Right and won a dune buggy.

308
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,323
别了 巴尼
Goodbye, Barney.

309
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,391
别了是什么意思 我不是
Good... I j...

310
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:43,745
她同意你在她面前放屁了
She lets you fart in front of her?

311
00:12:44,546 --> 00:12:45,630
巴尼
Barney...

312
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:48,633
把她追回来 速度
you go get that girl.

313
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,166
什么情况
Oh, God!

314
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,001
你不能告诉任何人你见过我
You cannot tell anyone that you saw me.

315
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:08,152
我今天不能结婚
I cannot get married today!

316
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,170
克劳斯
Klaus?

317
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,838
嗯 我有点乱
Oh, I'm a mess.

318
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,257
我在衣帽间吐了一地 然后嫁祸给某个熊孩子
I threw up in the cloakroom, I blamed a small child.

319
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,258
我不能结婚
I cannot get married.

320
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,426
我留了张字条
I left a note.

321
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,961
不错哦 不是每个人都想得到的哟
Good for you. Not everyone thinks of that.

322
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:17,962
哪个煞笔不留条的
Who doesn't leave a note?

323
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,963
这叫基本礼节懂不
It's common courtesy.

324
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,665
太谢谢了
Thank you!

325
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,500
你知道现在几点吗
Do you have the time? Um...

326
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,801
嗯 七点二十
Yeah, it's 20 after 7:00.

327
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,886
唔 很 好
Ah, sehr gut.

328
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,854
我还能赶得上八点五分的回城的车
I can still make the 8:05 back to the city.

329
00:13:26,856 --> 00:13:28,556
拜拜
Auf wiedersehen!

330
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,724
我一瞬间恍然大悟
And suddenly it hit me:

331
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,511
一个免除对维多利亚任何责难的妙招
a way to absolve Victoria of any blame.

332
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:37,065
只是我必须得爬上那下水道
All I had to do was climb that drainpipe.

333
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,393
什么 不 克劳斯 不
What? No, Klaus, no.

334
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:20,074
尼玛快点 懒鬼 是时候去 
Mach schnell, sleepyhead, it's time to...

335
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:21,659
我知道你和巴尼的事了
I know about you and Barney.

336
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,828
谁告诉她的
Who told her?!

337
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,279
你们啊
You guys did.

338
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,281
天 睡觉去行不
God, go to sleep.

339
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:31,285
好 在我们找到抖落秘密的真凶之前谁也不准走
Okay, no one is going anywhere until we find out who told you.

340
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,620
你看
Look...

341
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,673
我和罗宾已经不可能了
there is nothing going on between me and Robin.

342
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:37,425
我凭什么相信你
And why should I believe that?

343
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:39,377
呃 先说一句 我有男朋友了
Well, for starters, I have a boyfriend.

344
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,912
不 罗宾 你不用这么做
No, Robin, you don't have to do this.

345
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,247
谎言已经泛滥了
There've been enough lies.

346
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,766
说的是真的
I'm not lying.

347
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:46,134
他叫尼克
His name is Nick.

348
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,586
我怕出岔子都没告诉大家
I didn't want to jinx it by telling everyone,

349
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:50,438
所以我就跟马修莉莉说了
so I just told Marshall and Lily.

350
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,939
告诉他们吧 二位
You can tell 'em, guys.

351
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,644
我们刚刚才讨论过的
We were just talking about this earlier today.

352
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,147
好吧 我想说的是
Okay, well, what I was saying is...

353
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,653
我不想把巴尼追回来 因为我现在跟尼克在一起了
I have no desire to get Barney back because I'm with Nick now

354
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,439
而且 呃 姐不想那么三俗
and, well, I don't want to be crude,

355
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:12,443
姐只想整天都舔他的腹肌
but I want to spend all day licking his abs.

356
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,444
你们明白了吗
Do you understand?

357
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,630
嗯嗯 当然明白
Yes! God, yes!

358
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,666
你不用多费口舌了 妹子
You are preaching to the choir, sister.

359
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,618
我同意
I stand by it.

360
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,087
伙计们 没事儿
Guys, it's okay.

361
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:23,971
你们刚为人父母
You're new parents.

362
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,289
你们只是得睡会儿觉
You just need to get some sleep.

363
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,058
我们没事
We're fine!

364
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,512
当父母真很难
This is hard, guys.

365
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,481
真的很难
Really hard.

366
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,803
喔 老天 坚持住
Oh, God! Stay with me.

367
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:39,987
坚持住
Stay with me.

368
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,691
快去照顾你们的宝宝
Go get your baby. Yeah.

369
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,362
你看 我真不在乎你现在有了男朋友
Look, it doesn't matter that you have a boyfriend.

370
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,698
我在乎的是你是不是
I'm always gonna be wondering if you secretly

371
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,366
还对巴尼有感情
still have feelings for Barney.

372
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,368
我才不在乎那个人是谁
I don't care who this guy is.

373
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,673
好吧 我们没问题了
Okay, we're good.

374
00:15:59,842 --> 00:16:01,092
好吧
Okay, well,

375
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,428
多亏我早下班过来
I'm glad I left work early for this.

376
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,963
罗宾 也许我们一会儿得讨论下
Robin, maybe later we can discuss the meaning

377
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,216
"紧急情况"这个词和
of the word "emergency" and the phrase

378
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,550
"被车压住"这两个词的意思
"Trapped under a car."

379
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,168
-好吧 -好
Okay. Okay.

380
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:18,860
你知道他有小细腿
You know he has chicken legs.

381
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,679
跟小鸡一样的细腿儿
Little tiny chicken legs.

382
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,013
你们看到了 对吧
You guys saw those, right?

383
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,283
亲爱的 我去吧台躺下让尼克从我肚脐眼里喝酒
Honey, it's not cheating if I lie down on the bar

384
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,450
这不算偷腥吧
and let Nick do a shot from my belly button, right?

385
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,485
怎么个情况
Say what now?

386
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,519
巴尼同意喽
Barney's on board!

387
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,655
尼克 你慢走
Nick, hold on!

388
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:35,860
谢谢你今天帮我
Thanks for your help today.

389
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:37,695
没问题
Yeah, sure.

390
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:42,366
只是 看到你那么轻易地就把我们恋爱时的所有东西都处理掉
Although, it, uh, kind of sucked seeing how easy it was

391
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,503
真的很伤我心 真的
for you to throw away everything from our relationship.

392
00:16:46,556 --> 00:16:49,891
我...我可做不出来
I... I could never do that.

393
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,232
西14大街 622号
622 West 14th Street.

394
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,390
就这样 我和维多利亚又回到了出发点
<i>And so, Victoria and I were back where we started.</i>

395
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:10,361
但有一些事情却在我脑中挥之不去
<i>But there was something I couldn't get off my mind...</i>

396
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,916
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

397
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,455
呃 不好意思
Uh, excuse me.

398
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,257
嘿 是你
Oh, hey, it's you.

399
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,076
好吧 你得听我说 
<i>Ja,</i> okay, I'm not sure what kind of vibe

400
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,762
我不知道我之前是不是让你产生什么错觉
I was giving off before,but I am not interested

401
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:28,763
但我绝对不是对你感兴趣 明白吗
in your schnitzel, okay?

402
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,915
不 不 不 不 不 不是那样
No, no, no, no, no-- God, no.

403
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,384
我就是有个小问题
I-I just have one quick question:

404
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,386
维多利亚是个超棒的姑娘
Victoria seems like a great girl.

405
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,356
你为什么不愿意娶她呢
Why wouldn't you want to marry her?

406
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,758
呃 维多利亚她 她<i>棒呆了</i>
Ach, okay,
Victoria is <i>wunderbar.</i>

407
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
不好意思 <i>棒呆了</i>意思就是好极了
I'm sorry, <i>wunderbar</i> is the German word for wonderful.

408
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,928
是 哈 我知道
Yeah, no, I know.

409
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,979
喔 你讲德语
Oh, you speak German?

410
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:48,282
不
No...

411
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:49,901
不 不 不
No, no, no...

412
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,320
不 我只懂那一个词
No, just-just-just the one word.

413
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,437
哦 哦
Oh. Oh.

414
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:56,941
啊 维多利亚
Ah... Okay, Victoria.

415
00:17:56,943 --> 00:18:00,544
德语里有一个词 <i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.</i>
There is a word in German: <i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.</i>

416
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,079
最贴切的翻译是 
And the closest translation would be...

417
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,549
"真命天女"
"Lifelong Treasure of Destiny."

418
00:18:06,284 --> 00:18:08,285
的确 维多利亚<i>棒呆了</i>
And Victoria is <i>wunderbar,</i>

419
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,172

但她不是我“真命天女”
but she is not my <i>Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.</i>

420
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,507
她是我的<i>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand</i>
She is my <i>Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand</i>,

421
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,892
你明白吗
you know?

422
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,961
你知道<i>棒呆了</i>
You know <i>wunderbar</i>

423
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,596
却不知道Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand
but you don't know Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?

424
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,765
这词我们幼儿园就学过
That is something we learn in kindergarten.

425
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,733
不好意思 "幼儿园"这个词在德语里是――
I'm sorry, "kindergarten" is the German word for--

426
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,235
啊 啊 我知道的那个词
No, no, I know that one.

427
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,653
好吧
Oh, okay.

428
00:18:25,655 --> 00:18:26,771
但你不知道Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand
But you don't know Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?

429
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,489
你对德语的认识还真那么参差不齐
You are maddeningly inconsistent.

430
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:30,741
Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand的意思是
It means...

431
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,912
这就是你几乎想要的东西
"The thing that is almost the thing that you want...

432
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,915
但似乎又不是
...but it's not quite."

433
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,035
这就像维多利亚于我
Das ist Victoria to me.

434
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:44,205
你怎么知道她不是真命天女
How do you know she's not Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz?

435
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,624
我是说 也许随着时光流逝 她会变得更像
I mean, maybe as the years go by, she'll get

436
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,660
真命天女
Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz -ier.

437
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,178
哦 不不不
Oh, nein, nein, nein.

438
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,497
真命天女不是会随着时间变化的
Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz is not something

439
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,715
某种东西
that develops over time.

440
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,886
这是一种稍瞬即逝的东西
It is something that happens instantaneously.

441
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,605
它穿过你
It courses through you

442
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,508
就像风暴之后的河水
like the water of a river after a storm...

443
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,696
...在同时使你充盈 又使你空虚
...filling you and emptying you all at once.

444
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,791
你在你身体内
You feel it throughout your body...

445
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,746
你的手中
In your hands...

446
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,699
你的心里
In your heart...

447
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,369
你的胃里...
in your stomach...

448
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,391
你的皮肤里...
in your skin...

449
00:19:38,724 --> 00:19:40,643
当然还有在你的Schlauchmachendejungen里感受到它
Of course you feel it in your Schlauchmachendejungen.

450
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,880
原谅我用法语
Pardon my French.

451
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:45,766
你对某人有过这种感觉吗
Have you ever felt this way about someone?

452
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:49,236
是 我想是的
Yeah, I think so.

453
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:51,822
如果你还得考虑 那你还没感受到
If you have to think about it, you have not felt it.

454
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:55,326

当然
Of course.

456
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,412

他是对的
And he was right.

459
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,237
不幸的是 
Unfortunately, the "When" Of it was still

460
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,507
“何时”仍然有点遥远
a little ways down the road.

461
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,910
但是“何地”呢
But the "Where" Of it?

462
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,694

Oh, and don't forget your guitar.
