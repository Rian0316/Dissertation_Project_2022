她昨晚自杀未遂

00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,455
平庸对她来说不是坏事
boring would be a blessing.

324
00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:35,224
他们会切她的脑叶
They perform lobotomies now.

电量多到我们全城停电
Draws so much power,
it takes out entire city blocks.

331
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,239
就是因为那些倒霉鬼的脑子正在被炸透
When our lights dim,
some poor fucker's

332
00:20:50,273 --> 00:20:51,440
所以有时候我们的灯才那么暗

别听他的，Carl
Don't listen to him, Carl.

而且她会变得更好的

341
00:21:02,953 --> 00:21:04,954
那些药不会让她变好的
She's not better on her meds.

342
00:21:04,988 --> 00:21:07,958
她成了行尸走肉 她放弃了她生命中所有的热爱
She's a zombie. She gives up
everything she loves in life.

343
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:10,928

在他们把她变得不是她之前
before they steal what
makes Monica Monica.

347
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:21,839
你会帮我么
Are you with me?

348
00:21:21,874 --> 00:21:23,041
别管她了 Frank
Leave her alone, Frank.

349
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,543
她需要个转机来变得更好
She needs a chance to get well.

夏天掉了两个脚趾头 但她撑了过来
Lost two toes over the summer,
but she's hanging tough.

569
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:32,823
这也是没办法的事情
Well, she'd
have to be--

570
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:35,792
毕竟她和冰上舞蹈团一起滑了这么多年
all those years skating

They stole it, and I want
you to take it back.

580
00:31:57,884 --> 00:32:01,787
你不想要这个孩子
You don't... want
to keep the baby?

581
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:03,422

发育迟缓症
is "developmentally
delayed."

587
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,803
我孩子被我妈
Well, my baby was
stolen by my mom

588
00:32:17,838 --> 00:32:19,372
和她发育迟缓的男友偷了

So this is your mother,

604
00:33:05,954 --> 00:33:08,022
然后她想照看这个婴儿

to take care of the baby?

605
00:33:08,057 --> 00:33:09,424
对 但是我不想要
Yes, but I don't

606
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:11,659
-它留在这
-哦

607
00:33:11,694 --> 00:33:13,394
你想让一个陌生人照看他
And you want a total stranger

608
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:15,530
还是让伊利诺州政府
to take him or the
State of Illinois

609
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:18,332
用纳税人的钱
to be responsible for him

610
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,734
为他负责
on the taxpayers' dime?

611
