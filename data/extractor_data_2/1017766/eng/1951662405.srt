1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,098
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time ever

2
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:08,269
Mr. and Marshall Eriksen
and Lily Aldrin.

3
00:00:13,397 --> 00:00:17,329
Does it make you kind of sad that
we don't share the same last name?

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,266
You know, in a totally evolved
21st-century kind of way,

5
00:00:21,366 --> 00:00:22,693
yeah, a little.

6
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:24,574
You know what we should do?

7
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:26,971
We should come up with
a whole new last name.

8
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:30,349
Oh, that's easy--
Lily and Marshall Skywalker.

9
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,179
Lily and Marshall Hasselhoff.

10
00:00:34,115 --> 00:00:35,580
I got it. You ready?

11
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:36,531
- You ready?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:38,878
Lily and Marshall Awesome.

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,029
Have you met the Awesomes?

14
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,340
Marshall, Lily, their son,
Totally and their daughter, Freakin'?

15
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:46,902
I love you, Mr. Awesome.

16
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:48,800
I love you, Mrs. Awesome.

17
00:00:52,056 --> 00:00:53,680
- So...
- So...

18
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,073
Wedding's over.

19
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,423
Yes, it is.

20
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:58,752
I guess starting tomorrow,

21
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,203
we can tell people.

22
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:02,080
Tell people what?

23
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:03,571
Hi, Barney.

24
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:04,792
Tell people what?

25
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:06,331
The food looks delicious,
doesn't it?

26
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:07,551
Tell people what?

27
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:08,371
Nothing.

28
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:10,731
Oh, okay. Tell people what?

29
00:01:10,888 --> 00:01:11,971
Can we talk about this later?

30
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:13,840
Absolutely. Tell people what?

31
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:16,660
- Hi. Have you met Barney?
- Hey. Barney Stinson.

32
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,793
Lovely dress.
I know, I'm sick of these things, too.

33
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:21,170
It's like the same wedding over and
over again. You're totally right.

34
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,732
You want to dance? Great,
see you out there. Tell people what?

35
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:27,670
Look, this is just not something we want
to talk about right now, okay, Barney?

36
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:30,572
Okay.

37
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:34,113
Whoo, that was a close one.

38
00:01:34,217 --> 00:01:35,912
Think he'll actually let it go?

39
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:38,380
Tell people what?
Tell people what? Tell people what?

40
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:40,583
Tell people what?
Tell people...

41
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:45,140
There's a black Nissan Stanza in
the parking lot with it's lights on.

42
00:01:45,248 --> 00:01:46,730
Tell people what?
Tell people what?

46
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,513
Can I get a water please?

47
00:02:01,886 --> 00:02:03,442
- Tell people what?
- Oh, God! Okay.

48
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,741
Look, we have some... news.

49
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,220
But we don't want to draw attention
away from Lily and Marshall's big day.

50
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,031
So just forget about it until
they leave for the honeymoon.

51
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:14,290
Fine.

52
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,570
- It's pretty big, though.
- Oh, my God, just tell me!

53
00:02:18,677 --> 00:02:20,340
- Oh, help us.
- What's wrong?

54
00:02:20,445 --> 00:02:21,783
We're starving.

55
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:23,781
We planned this amazing
meal with the caterers,

56
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:25,483
and we haven't
had a bite of it.

57
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:28,692
Every time we get near the food,
we get cocktail weiner blocked.

58
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,353
Marshall!

59
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,602
We haven't eaten all day.

60
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,072
All right,
let's run some interference.

61
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:02,220
Yeah, we'll get you back to your table.
Come on.

62
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:05,770
Oh, there you are.

63
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,203
My dear, you look so beautiful.

64
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,710
Thanks, Grammie,
but we really need to...

65
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:13,381
And you...
you look like a 1940s movie star.

66
00:03:13,487 --> 00:03:16,050
And you look like a pepper-crusted
rack of lamb with mint jelly.

67
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:18,120
All right,
let's get these two back to their table.

68
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:21,791
We will see you on the floor for
the conga line later, won't we?

69
00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:24,932
The answer to that one
was decided weeks earlier.

70
00:03:26,885 --> 00:03:27,861
Conga line.

71
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,073
Oh, yes, definitely.

72
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:33,093
How about a slide show of
you guys through the years

73
00:03:33,197 --> 00:03:35,981
set to Green Day's
"Time of Your Life"

74
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:38,991
and ending with your baby
photos side by side.

75
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:42,363
Oh, that's great.
Going on the list.

76
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:43,293
What list?

77
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:47,642
Horrible wedding clichés we're not going
to touch with a ten-foot limbo pole.

78
00:03:47,746 --> 00:03:49,722
Oh, like First Corinthians?

79
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,133
That Bible verse?

80
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,433
They do that at every wedding.

81
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:53,481
How's it go?

82
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,070
"Love is patient and kind.

83
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,952
"Love does not envy or boast.

84
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,231
"It is not arrogant or rude.

85
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,441
"Love does not insist
on it's own way.

86
00:04:02,546 --> 00:04:05,480
"It is not irritable
or resentful.

87
00:04:05,585 --> 00:04:07,270
"Love bears all things,

88
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,510
"believes all things,

89
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:11,613
"hopes all things...

90
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,122
"endures all things."

91
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,390
- Lame.
- Going on the list.

92
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,933
We've done it.
A wedding with zero clichés.

93
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:25,262
Wait, isn't doing it in the reception
hall bathroom kind of a cliché?

94
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:26,880
Well, okay, one cliché.

95
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:28,973
Well, technically two.

96
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:32,602
No! They cleared
our plates again!

97
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:36,011
Pepper-crusted rack of lamb,
where did you go?!

98
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,731
It's my wedding night.
I was supposed to have my way with you.

99
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,053
Well, you still have me.

100
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:43,242
Yeah...

101
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,741
Anyway, guys, we're kind of
in the middle of something,

102
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,712
so if you could go bicker or
share a tense, sexless silence

103
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:52,090
or whatever married people do
somewhere else, that'd be great.

104
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,952
No, Barney, this is my wedding,

105
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,792
and I will sit wherever
I damn well...

106
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,272
Are those mini quiches?

107
00:04:58,797 --> 00:05:00,103
Tell the secret.

108
00:05:00,278 --> 00:05:01,773
Okay, uh...

109
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:03,442
it was our anniversary,

110
00:05:03,547 --> 00:05:05,372
so we went to this
restaurant Carmichael's,

111
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,322
which is where we went
on our first date.

112
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,121
Remember, the place where I stole
the blue French horn for Robin?

113
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,101
Oh, right, that was you.

114
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,040
I knew that was
somebody I knew.

115
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:15,943
What?

116
00:05:16,047 --> 00:05:17,192
Dude, you were there.

117
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:20,671
That was like a big iconic
moment in all of our lives.

118
00:05:20,775 --> 00:05:23,150
Maybe in your life--
I got a lot of stuff going on.

119
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:27,300
Okay, so we're sitting there
and the waiter comes over...

120
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:28,720
Champagne?

121
00:05:28,825 --> 00:05:30,801
Um, we didn't order champagne.

122
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,363
Compliments of the house.

123
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,250
Wow.

124
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:34,730
Thanks.

125
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:37,160
Cheers.

126
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:40,463
And there, sitting at the bottom
of my champagne glass is...

127
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,561
Mini quiche.

128
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:43,353
You're a mega-douche.

129
00:05:43,455 --> 00:05:46,381
Oh, that's right, they moved that
table back toward the kitchen,

130
00:05:46,486 --> 00:05:48,943
because that's where they're setting
up a surprise chocolate fountain.

131
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:51,050
Oh, no, I gave it away.

132
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,092
So what was in the glass?

133
00:05:57,197 --> 00:05:57,970
Right.

134
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:00,620
So the waiter comes up
with two glasses of Dom.

135
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,952
He says, "Champagne?"
"We didn't order any champagne."

136
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:04,551
"Compliments of
the house." "Wow."

137
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,453
You said that already!

138
00:06:06,556 --> 00:06:08,862
Right. So Robin looks down,

139
00:06:08,965 --> 00:06:11,830
and there at the
bottom of her glass...

140
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,041
Is an engagement ring.

141
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,442
Anything you want to say
to the bride and groom?

142
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:20,770
Don't get married.

143
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,770
Why don't I come back.

144
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,541
An engagement ring?

145
00:06:29,643 --> 00:06:31,718
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

146
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:33,419
Ted, you cannot do
this to me. No.

147
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,951
No, no, no!

148
00:06:36,816 --> 00:06:38,412
That's what she said.

149
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:39,880
No.

150
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,622
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted, you cannot do this to me.

151
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,642
No. No, no, no.

152
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:46,940
What are you talking about?

153
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:50,783
This. This is what I'm talking about.
What is this doing in my champagne?

154
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,853
Oh, God, listen...
I just got to get out of here.

155
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:54,392
That's not mine.

156
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,552
What?

157
00:06:55,656 --> 00:06:57,343
That's not mine.

158
00:06:57,446 --> 00:06:58,952
Then whose is it?

159
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,771
It's mine.

160
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,652
Janna...

161
00:07:05,888 --> 00:07:07,611
will you marry me?

162
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,211
Yes.

163
00:07:15,826 --> 00:07:17,012
Wow.

164
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:22,250
That was hilarious.
I was like... what?

165
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:24,152
Anyway.

166
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:26,831
What the hell was that?

167
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:28,783
What the hell was what?

168
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,540
That reaction?

169
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:32,353
I thought you were
proposing to me.

170
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:35,861
Really? Because it sounded like you
thought I was trying to set you on fire.

171
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:38,131
Ted, you know how I
feel about marriage.

172
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:39,593
Now more than ever.

173
00:07:39,697 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm sorry,
were you planning on proposing tonight?

174
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:42,402
No.

175
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:43,493
Then why is this an issue?

176
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,153
Because even though you
don't want to get married,

177
00:07:45,186 --> 00:07:47,273
I'd like to think the fact that
we've been together for a year,

178
00:07:47,307 --> 00:07:49,700
and that we love each other
might get me a gentler reaction

179
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:52,942
than, "No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

180
00:07:53,045 --> 00:07:54,810
"Ted, you cannot do this to me.

181
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,351
"No. No, no, no."

182
00:07:58,306 --> 00:08:00,871
Okay, you're right, I just...
freaked out.

183
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,430
I don't know why.

184
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:04,040
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:04,975 --> 00:08:06,830
Can we please just let it go?

186
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,403
No.

187
00:08:11,436 --> 00:08:12,762
Hey, Stinson.

188
00:08:13,915 --> 00:08:16,132
Never lie to a man about
a chocolate fountain.

189
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,003
So did you guys find
anything to eat?

190
00:08:19,105 --> 00:08:21,581
I had four strawberries.

191
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,990
Was there a side of champagne
with each of the strawberries?

192
00:08:25,096 --> 00:08:26,400
Yes.

193
00:08:27,658 --> 00:08:31,353
Lily, you could have burped
or said the word "Yes,"

194
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:34,940
but the fact that you did both
is exactly why I married you.

195
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,131
Oh, look, more strawberries!

196
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:41,353
So what happened next?

197
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,640
- Ted, don't do this.
- No, seriously.

198
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,443
Where do you see
yourself in five years?

199
00:08:45,548 --> 00:08:47,063
Where do you see yourself?

200
00:08:48,088 --> 00:08:50,391
Honestly, in five years...

201
00:08:50,688 --> 00:08:52,702
I probably want to be married.

202
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:56,831
And I probably want
to be in Argentina.

203
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:59,800
- Argentina?
- Or Tokyo, or Paris.

204
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:02,642
Look, Ted, I don't know where
I'm going to be in five years.

205
00:09:02,745 --> 00:09:05,672
And I don't want to know.
I want my life to be an adventure.

206
00:09:07,495 --> 00:09:09,623
We have an expiration date,
don't we?

207
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,571
Oh, my God.

208
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,563
You guys broke up.

209
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,282
You guys broke up.
I can't believe it.

210
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:23,573
Barney...

211
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,440
story's not over.

212
00:09:25,786 --> 00:09:28,390
Can we please not talk about this here.
Can we go home?

213
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,230
Yeah, of course.

214
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,280
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry about this.
Can we actually...

215
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:33,820
Oh, my God, it's you.

216
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:35,333
Wha... what?

217
00:09:35,436 --> 00:09:39,342
You're the son of a bitch who
stole our blue French horn.

218
00:09:40,076 --> 00:09:41,022
Run!

219
00:09:41,317 --> 00:09:43,521
Run? Your strategy was run?

220
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,932
It was a perfectly good idea.

221
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:46,573
They didn't have our
credit card information.

222
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:47,860
They didn't know us from Adam.

223
00:09:47,968 --> 00:09:48,961
I stand by it.

224
00:09:49,065 --> 00:09:49,660
Yeah?

225
00:09:49,736 --> 00:09:51,292
And how did that
work out for you?

226
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:57,211
I don't see why they had to keep
my credit card and driver's license

227
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,741
till we bring the horn back.

228
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:00,711
Well, come on, Ted,
can you blame them?

229
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:02,823
Look, I'm sorry about
the French horn.

230
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:04,542
I want to make this right.

231
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:07,923
So what we're going to do right now is,
we're going to run!

232
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:14,950
So... Argentina.

233
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:16,561
Argentina.

234
00:10:16,726 --> 00:10:18,953
Why is this the first
I've heard of Argentina?

235
00:10:19,055 --> 00:10:21,710
Mmm, American schools
suck at geography.

236
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:25,441
What would be the point in telling
you that I want to live in Argentina?

237
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:26,621
You don't want to live there.

238
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:27,940
I could want to
live in Argentina.

239
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:28,953
No, you couldn't.

240
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:31,021
I mean,
you life is here and your career.

241
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:33,212
I'm a journalist,
my career could take me anywhere,

242
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:35,042
and I hope it does.

243
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,370
Hey. I could be an
architect anywhere, too.

244
00:10:37,476 --> 00:10:39,263
They have buildings
in Argentina.

245
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:41,720
And Paris. And even Tokyo.

246
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:44,741
I don't know if you ever saw Godzilla, but
he wasn't knocking down a bunch of tents.

247
00:10:44,775 --> 00:10:47,831
So, what? You're saying you
want to move to Argentina?

248
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:53,191
Well, I always regretted not taking
a year in college to live abroad.

249
00:10:53,256 --> 00:10:54,770
I just finished a
big project at work.

250
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:57,023
I got some money saved up.

251
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,310
If ever there were a time in my life to
do something like this, it's right now.

252
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:02,900
Let's move to Argentina.

253
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:04,970
Oh, shut up.

254
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,100
You're scared
I might not be kidding.

255
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,500
Aren't you?

256
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:10,883
Nope.

257
00:11:13,998 --> 00:11:15,521
Your move, Scherbatsky.

258
00:11:18,505 --> 00:11:19,640
Okay.

259
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,480
Let's do it--
let's move to Argentina.

260
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:27,250
No es posible!

261
00:11:27,427 --> 00:11:29,650
Nobody moves to Argentina.

262
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:32,800
The Argentinean peso has dropped
two-thirds in five years,

263
00:11:32,906 --> 00:11:35,190
the government is opposed
to free market reforms,

264
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:39,591
and the railroad has been a mess since
the breakup of Ferrocarriles Argentinos.

265
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,711
I hooked up with an
Argentinean exchange student

266
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:44,551
in a Porta-John
outside Yankee Stadium.

267
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:46,382
Man, she was chatty.

268
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,923
Right? Right?

269
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,483
You caught the bouquet?

270
00:11:51,505 --> 00:11:52,723
Barney.

271
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:55,020
The story's not over yet.

272
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:57,490
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What?

273
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,160
I don't know if I
can do this to you.

274
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:00,951
Do what?

275
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,990
Well, you say you want
to move to Argentina,

276
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,561
but you want to have kids.

277
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:07,821
Oh, right.
'Cause there are no kids there.

278
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:11,271
On Santa's map of the world,
there's a big black "X" over Argentina.

279
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,872
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

280
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,392
Okay, say we had kids.

281
00:12:16,497 --> 00:12:18,931
They wouldn't have to grow
up in some suburb somewhere.

282
00:12:19,037 --> 00:12:21,923
They would grow up on the road
having adventures with us.

283
00:12:22,028 --> 00:12:25,152
Think of all the Hard Rock Cafe
T-shirts they could collect.

284
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:28,810
Ted, you know that kids were
never a part of my plan.

285
00:12:30,866 --> 00:12:33,721
But if I was going to
have someone's babies,

286
00:12:35,168 --> 00:12:36,653
I'd have your babies.

287
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,102
That's when you run.

288
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,851
Tell me you ran, Ted.

289
00:12:45,238 --> 00:12:47,911
Wait, wait, wait. We don't want to
start having babies right this second.

290
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:48,941
Do you have a...?

291
00:12:49,047 --> 00:12:50,260
No, I don't.

292
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:53,002
Well, we probably shouldn't.

293
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,631
Yeah.

294
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:02,300
- Risk it?
- Risk it.

295
00:13:19,277 --> 00:13:20,493
No.

296
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:26,653
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
if you're all gather around,

297
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:29,312
Lily and Marshall are
going to cut the cake.

298
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,811
No. Robin, you're not...

299
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,120
No, say the story's not over.

300
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:35,360
Come on,
they're cutting the cake.

301
00:13:35,396 --> 00:13:36,872
Say the story's not over!

302
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:41,670
Oh, God, this is the 12th most worried
I've ever been that someone's pregnant.

303
00:13:45,556 --> 00:13:46,791
Okay, Lily.

304
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:50,513
I'm really hungry, so let's just,
uh, aim for my mouth, okay?

305
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:53,071
Besides, the smearing the cake
thing's a cliché, remember?

306
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:55,681
No, it's going to be so funny.

307
00:13:55,786 --> 00:13:57,003
Lily.

308
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:00,513
Lily, just feed me the cake.

309
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:04,691
Please, baby, I am so hungry.

310
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:10,981
Whoopsy-daisy.

311
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,072
And she's okay.

312
00:14:13,298 --> 00:14:15,192
- She's all right.
- That was funny.

313
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,013
And it's time for
the honeymoon.

314
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,880
Guys, guys, guys.
Thank you so much.

315
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,100
We love you.

316
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,261
I love you.

317
00:14:23,367 --> 00:14:26,061
Getting married, having kids.

318
00:14:26,168 --> 00:14:29,401
It's all a mistake.
It's a horrible, horrible mistake.

319
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:31,682
God, this guy's
giving me nothing.

320
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,352
All right,
have fun in Scotland.

321
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:37,791
If you see the Loch Ness Monster,
tell him Ted Mosby says, "What's up?"

322
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:39,913
Nessie's a she, Ted, come on.

323
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,481
Hey, kiddo.

324
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:02,213
You are going to miss out
on a lot of awesome stuff.

325
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,243
You'll be at home with the kid

326
00:15:04,347 --> 00:15:07,133
while I am out awesome-ing
all over the place.

327
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,932
And you're going to get fat.

328
00:15:11,617 --> 00:15:13,252
The story's not over, Barney.

329
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:16,682
Okay, time to get the
horn back to the bistro.

330
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:19,593
Oh, Ted, I don't know if I can go again.
That tuckered me out.

331
00:15:19,695 --> 00:15:21,051
Not a euphemism.

332
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:26,402
Right. Okay, let me just go change,
and we'll leave.

333
00:15:26,506 --> 00:15:29,462
Whoa, whoa,
you get to change and I don't? Uh-uh.

334
00:15:29,568 --> 00:15:30,922
Solidarity, sister.

335
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:34,290
That is crazy. I have a change of
clothes and you don't. Suck it up.

336
00:15:34,398 --> 00:15:36,983
Well, if we'd actually moved in
together, all my stuff would be here,

337
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,801
but we didn't, so...

338
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,680
Yeah.

339
00:15:50,656 --> 00:15:52,661
We were all talk, weren't we?

340
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,610
We're not doing this, are we?

341
00:15:59,196 --> 00:16:01,580
I don't want to have
kids in Argentina.

342
00:16:01,686 --> 00:16:04,471
And I don't want to
have kids in Argentina.

343
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,123
So where does that leave us?

344
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:13,670
Well...

345
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,442
we could stay together and...

346
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,991
pretend this stuff
doesn't matter.

347
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:25,731
Or...

348
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:29,461
we could give back
the blue French horn.

349
00:16:34,138 --> 00:16:36,601
You stole a blue
French horn for me.

350
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:43,500
I would have stolen
you a whole orchestra.

351
00:16:54,835 --> 00:16:56,290
You did break up.

352
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:57,973
Yep.

353
00:16:58,227 --> 00:16:59,381
You're not pregnant?

354
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:00,602
Nope.

355
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:03,333
An-And Marshall and
Lily don't know?

356
00:17:03,597 --> 00:17:06,513
Well, afterwards, uh,
we came by to tell you guys,

357
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,421
but Lily was pretty
stressed out, so...

358
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,011
We decided not to say anything
till after the wedding.

359
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:16,462
You guys okay?

360
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:20,782
Well, it hasn't been the easiest
two weeks of our lives, but...

361
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:22,830
But we're okay.

362
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,381
The open bar helps.

363
00:17:26,847 --> 00:17:28,443
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Hi.

364
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,392
Could I have this dance?

365
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,531
Well, we knew this day
would come eventually.

366
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,331
Take care of her, little man.

367
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:54,273
This is by far the drunkest
I've ever seen you.

368
00:17:56,455 --> 00:17:57,991
Uh, driver.

369
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,281
Hello!

370
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:03,573
Ranjit.

371
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:06,420
Hey, can we make a stop before
we head back to the hotel?

372
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:08,671
You do not have to stop.

373
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:13,492
You can be together as man
and wife right back there,

374
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,542
and because we are friends...

375
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,870
I will not watch.

376
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:23,562
Um, no,
we actually had something else in mind.

377
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,493
Okay.

378
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,293
Lily, go sit down.

379
00:18:29,928 --> 00:18:31,412
Welcome to Wienerburger.

380
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:32,483
Hi.

381
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:36,113
Can we get a number one,
please, with no pickles?

382
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,603
And a number four
with no onions.

383
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,223
Let me guess.
Jefferson High prom?

384
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,551
No.

385
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,892
But thank you.

386
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,612
Actually, we just got married.

387
00:18:47,715 --> 00:18:50,880
- Wow. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

388
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:52,802
That's $7.80.

389
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,100
- Hey, dude.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:00,070
I don't know how to say this, but
your wife just threw up in the trash.

391
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,980
My wife.

392
00:19:08,486 --> 00:19:10,610
So Marshall and
Lily were married,

393
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:12,723
and Robin and I were broken up.

394
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,500
And as hard as it
was at the time,

395
00:19:14,605 --> 00:19:16,500
in the end we both
got what we wanted.

396
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:19,470
She did eventually go
on to live in Argentina

397
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:22,123
and Morocco and Greece, Russia,

398
00:19:22,225 --> 00:19:24,082
even Japan for a little while.

399
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:27,730
And I... well, I met your mom.

400
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:30,450
I think for the most part if
you're really honest with yourself

401
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,170
about what you
want out of life,

402
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,890
life gives it to you.

403
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:40,003
Of course, at that moment, all I
really wanted was a scotch and soda

404
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:41,611
and a cigar.

405
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,102
I'm really sorry
about you and Robin.

406
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,950
I know I was always joking around
about wanting you two to break up,

407
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,743
but you were really
good together.

408
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:08,512
Yeah...

409
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:10,652
we were.

410
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:14,181
She just wasn't the one,
you know?

411
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,253
The one. Oh, Ted, no.

412
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:21,043
Do not tell me you're going to
start searching for "the one" again.

413
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:23,113
The only time I want to
hear you saying "the one"

414
00:20:23,217 --> 00:20:26,042
is if it's followed by the
word "hundredth." What up?

415
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:28,613
No, I need a break
from all that, I...

416
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:32,213
I just want to get out there and
have fun for a while, you know?

417
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,590
Really?

418
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,500
'Cause...

419
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,723
you know, you've been in
a relationship for a year.

420
00:20:38,827 --> 00:20:42,022
You're going to...
be a little rusty.

421
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,893
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying...

422
00:20:47,188 --> 00:20:49,782
you're gonna need, need,
need some help out there.

423
00:20:50,186 --> 00:20:51,752
Could be.

424
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:54,863
Ted?

425
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:56,660
Yes, Barney.

426
00:20:58,066 --> 00:20:59,513
Do you think...

427
00:21:03,226 --> 00:21:05,161
Do you think maybe you might...

428
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:07,542
need a wingman again?

429
00:21:12,247 --> 00:21:13,290
I do.

430
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:16,463
Yes!

431
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:19,021
Yes! We're back.

432
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:20,853
We are back.

433
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:24,333
And Ted, my boy,
it's going to be legend...

434
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,641
Wait for it.

435
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,603
