1
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,775
您这次要参加的是什么样的巡航
So what kind of cruise is this you're going on?

2
00:00:05,775 --> 00:00:08,115
这次水上之行称为"重生之旅"
It's called the Born Again Boat Ride.

3
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:11,885
基督教季刊给予了这次旅途最高的评价
Christian Quarterly gave it their highest rating--

4
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:14,385
五颗荆棘王冠呢
five thorny crowns.

5
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:16,785
我真希望你能跟我一起去  谢尔顿
I do wish you'd come with me, Sheldon.

6
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:20,655
老妈  如果我去了就等于直接证明
Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof

7
00:00:20,655 --> 00:00:22,855
您的神真的能造就奇迹
that your God can work miracles.

8
00:00:23,895 --> 00:00:24,965
这你可就错了
You're missing out.

9
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:26,295
到时候欢乐肯定无所不在
It's gonna be wall-to-wall fun.

10
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:27,435
全都有主题哦
It's all themed.

11
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:29,535
届时能看到"约拿和鲸鱼"[圣经故事]
There's Jonah and the Whale watching.

12
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,905
你还能吃到名为"最后的晚餐"的自助餐
All-you-can-eat Last Supper Buffet.

13
00:00:33,905 --> 00:00:36,305
以及我本人的最爱  "神之恕击"
And my personal favorite, Gunning with God.

14
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:39,805
我冒昧的问一下  什么叫"神之恕击"
What's Gunning with God? I'm afraid to ask.

15
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,515
说起来非常的有趣
Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

16
00:00:42,515 --> 00:00:45,145
首先将你的罪恶写在一个泥制飞靶上
You write your sins on a clay pigeon,

17
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,315
再用机器把靶子弹射出去
they fire 'em up in the air,

18
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:49,615
然后你拿一把12发弹容的散弹枪打爆它
and you pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun

19
00:00:49,825 --> 00:00:52,785
充满了神的宽恕啊
full of our Lord's forgiveness.

20
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,095
老实说  妈妈  我很高兴看到
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see

21
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:56,865
你们天主教团思想进步了
how advanced your group has become--

22
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:58,595
敢于出海
you are willing to sail out into the ocean

23
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,495
不再担心地球是平的 船会摔下去
without fear of falling off the edge.

24
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:01,495
暗讽《圣经》里多处暗示大地是一块平板

25
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,295
打个比方
For example,

26
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:05,235
如果谢利在船上  他应该
if Shelly was aboard, he'd write,

27
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:07,305
在飞靶写上"牙尖嘴利"
"Smart mouth" on his pigeon,

28
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:11,245
然后来个五雷轰顶
and then bam!

29
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,645
神予之 神毁之
The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away.

30
00:01:14,145 --> 00:01:17,945
老妈  根据我们以往周末的安排
Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together,

31
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:21,155
-欢乐应该始于炸鸡  -听起来很美味啊
- the fun begins with fried chicken. - Sounds delicious.

32
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:23,155
很好  因为我已经帮你备齐了所有材料
Good, 'cause I got you everything you need to make it.

33
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:26,085
你有口福了
You are in for a treat.

34
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:27,055
我爸的棺材
My mother's fried chicken

35
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,965
之所以变成加大号的  就是因为我妈的炸鸡美味
is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin.

36
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,625
谢尔顿  她刚下飞机
Sheldon, she just got off the plane.

37
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,365
她不想做饭了
She doesn't want to cook.

38
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:35,965
她当然想做
Of course she does.

39
00:01:35,965 --> 00:01:38,535
做饭给我吃  是她向我表达"我爱你"的方式
Making me food is her way of saying "I love you""

40
00:01:38,535 --> 00:01:40,805
在她筋疲力尽的时候做给我吃
Making me food when she's too tired to cook

41
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:42,875
是她向我表达"我真的很爱你"的方式
is her way of saying "I really love you."

42
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:45,975
其实我并不介意出去吃  谢尔顿
Actually, I wouldn't mind going out for a bite, Sheldon.

43
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,475
吃那些粗粮
Won't that spoil our appetites

44
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,815
会坏了吃炸鸡的好胃口吧
for the chicken you're going to make me?

45
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:50,685
好了  就这么定了  我们出去吃
All right, that settles it, we're going out.

46
00:01:50,685 --> 00:01:52,815
你喜欢吃寿司吗  街上有家小店不错
Do you like sushi? There's a great little place down the street.

47
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:54,155
我没吃过寿司
I've never had it,

48
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:57,155
不过试试新鲜事物总没什么坏处
but there's no harm in trying something new.

49
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,055
尝试新鲜事物坏处多了
There's a lot of harm in trying something new.

50
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:03,655
所以要用兔子来测试药物和化妆品的安全性
That's why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

51
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:06,565
谢尔顿  你的言行像个疯子
Sheldon, you're talking like a crazy person.

52
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,865
其实  他小时候我带他检查过了
Actually, I had him tested as a child.

53
00:02:09,865 --> 00:02:11,635
医生说他很正常
Doctor says he's fine.

54
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:13,235
早跟你说了
Told you.

55
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:14,875
虽然我很后悔没接着去找
Although, I do regret not following up

56
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:17,105
休斯顿的那位专家
with that specialist in Houston.

57

生活大爆炸  第五季第六集

66
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:45,552
欢迎光临
いらっしゃいます

67
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:46,722
别瞎嚷嚷了
Stop yelling!

68
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:50,132
来这儿我很不开心
I'm not happy about this.

69
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:52,532
你这辈子什么时候开心过吗
What's the last thing you were ever happy about?

70
00:02:52,632 --> 00:02:55,462
等着吃炸鸡的时候
The prospect of fried chicken.

71
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:58,432
真令人激动
This is exciting.

72
00:02:58,442 --> 00:03:01,042
咱家四号公路线那的馆子也卖寿司
Back home, the diner on Route Four serves sushi,

73
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,112
但他们只是把炸鱼排切碎
but it's just cut up fish sticks

74
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:04,712
再配上"本恩大叔"牌速食米饭
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

75
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:08,372
即使他们用"功夫文"写菜单
They put it on the menu in those kung fu letters,

76
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:10,482
但假货就假货
but that don't make it sushi.

77
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:15,422
额  "功夫文"好像有点种族歧视吧
Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct.

78
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:18,892
ching chong:外国人模仿中国话发音  变相对亚洲人的种族诋毁的词语

79
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:18,892
我还以为只有"ching chong"是不能说的呢
Oh, I thought the one we couldn't say was "ching chong"

80
00:03:19,592 --> 00:03:22,362
额  对  那个也不能说
Yeah, yeah, that, too.

81
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,162
谢利
So, Shelly,

82
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,092
你和你的朋友艾米进展如何了
what's up with you and your friend Amy,

83
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:28,532
如果你不介意妈妈窥探点隐私的话
if you don't mind a mother prying a bit?

84
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:31,602
艾米的确有大进展
Well, there's actually big news on the Amy front.

85
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:32,442
她最近在研究
She's been studying

86
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:35,442
神经生物学中有关低等生物的上瘾问题
the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals.

87
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:39,612
她就差这么一点点  就能让海星迷上可卡因了
She's this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine.

88
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:42,912
你知道他们两个发展的情况吗
Do you have any idea what's going on with those two?

89
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,812
他们俩的关系就像尼斯湖水怪
It's kind of like the Loch Ness monster.

90
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:46,622
也许事实存在  也许不存在
Maybe there's something there, maybe there isn't.

91
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,322
真相可能永远藏在湖里
We'll probably never know.

92
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:53,622
偷想这问题来惊吓一下自己  还是挺有意思的
But sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it.

93
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:59,762
你跟年轻女孩子相处得怎样
How are you doing on the young lady front?

94
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:02,632
我听闻你被异地恋困扰着
I hear you're in some sort of a long distance situation?

95
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,802
是啊  拉杰的妹妹
Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

96
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,872
情况比较棘手  她远在印度
It's kind of tough.  She's in India.

97
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,572
她父母也不希望她跟白种人交往
Also, her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white.

98
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,872
那真是个有趣的转机  不是吗
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

99
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:16,042
在约会之前  你怎么没想过这个问题呢
You never think about it going the other way.

100
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,752
有些事情你强求不来
Well, you can't force things.

101
00:04:20,752 --> 00:04:23,422
你应该想想你们是否真的是在交往
You need to figure out if you're in a relationship

102
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:24,352
还是你们只是名义上的
or if you're just calling it one.

103
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:27,032
就好像常言道  你可以把米放到电锅里
It's like they say--a cat can have kittens in the oven

104
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:29,132
不代表米就会成炊
but that don't make 'em biscuits.

105
00:04:30,432 --> 00:04:32,062
这提醒了我另外一句常言
And that reminds me of another saying.

106
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:34,162
你可以诱拐鸡跳炸锅
You can lead a chicken to Crisco,

107
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:36,662
但不代表你能诱拐你妈去炸鸡
but you can't make your mother fry it.

108
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,572
谢尔顿  你再拿鸡的事情烦我
Sheldon, you pester me one more time about chicken,

109
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,972
我就把你按到我膝盖上  当众打你屁股
I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant.

110
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:49,142
求你烦她吧  就当为了我
Please pester her. Please, for me.

111
00:04:52,312 --> 00:04:54,552
库珀夫人  你觉得寿司如何
So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?

112
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,522
很不错
It was good.

113
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,022
唯一美中不足的是
The only thing that would have made it better

114
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:59,492
它要是熟食就好了
is if it was cooked

115
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,892
要是夹牛肉 就更棒了
and if it was beef.

116
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:06,762
谢尔顿  你房东何时能把电梯修理一下
Sheldon, when is your landlord going to fix the elevator?

117
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,502
我不清楚
I don't know.

118
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:10,132
最近我们有在商量
Lately we've been talking about

119
00:05:10,132 --> 00:05:13,672
把电梯改造成导弹发射井
converting it into a missile silo.

120
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:15,342
你儿子似乎觉得
Your son seems to think

121
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:18,972
咱们得先对伯班克发动攻击啊
we need to launch a preemptive strike on Burbank.

122
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:22,182
先下手为强 后下手遭殃嘛
Get them before they get us.

123
00:05:28,522 --> 00:05:31,952
看看是谁大驾光临了
Hey, look who decided to show up.

124
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,022
拉杰  你搞什么
Raj, what are you doing?

125
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:38,192
我找不到你们  就买了六个新朋友
I couldn't find you guys so I bought six new friends.

126
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:42,602
可惜的是  有三个已经阵亡了
Three, sadly, are dead.

127
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:45,072
妈妈  你记得拉杰吗
Mom, you remember Rajesh?

128
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:47,642
-拉杰  这位是我妈妈  -当然记得  库珀夫人嘛
- Rajesh, my mother. - Of course.Mrs. Cooper.

129
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,372
很高兴再见到你
So nice to see you again.

130
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,772
我也是
Well, it's so nice to see you, too.

131
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:59,312
印第安人和印度人都叫Indian

132
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,142
我以为印第安人才偶有酗酒问题
I thought it was our Indians

133
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:59,312
没想到印度人也会呀
that had the occasional alcohol problem.

134
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:03,552
这也带歧视  不能说
We don't say that, either.

135
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,762
我回头列个单子给你
I'll make you a list.

136
00:06:06,762 --> 00:06:09,422
你真是太好了  不愧是白人
Oh, that would be mighty white of you.

137
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:15,262
拉杰  你借酒浇愁
So, Raj, what pain are you trying

138
00:06:15,272 --> 00:06:17,272
是为了什么事
to cover up with alcohol?

139
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,572
没什么  我很好
Nothing, I'm fine.

140
00:06:18,572 --> 00:06:20,802
-是吗  -不  我不好
- Are ya? - No.

141
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:22,402
这样好多了
That's better.

142
00:06:22,412 --> 00:06:24,142
说说你有什么困扰
Now tell me what's bothering you.

143
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,242
我好孤独
I'm so lonely.

144
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:28,842
当然了  孤单的出生 孤独的死去
Oh, yes, born alone, die alone.

145
00:06:28,852 --> 00:06:30,882
人类就是如此悲剧
It's a tragic human condition.

146
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,182
拉杰
Now, Raj,

147
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:33,452
你快别烦我妈了
if you'll excuse my mother,

148
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:35,352
她要去给我做核桃派
she's about to make a pecan pie

149
00:06:35,352 --> 00:06:36,282
要是好吃
that'll be so good

150
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:39,422
我就暂时不计较炸鸡的事
I'll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken.

151
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,462
谢尔顿  你朋友很伤心
Sheldon, your friend is hurtin'.

152
00:06:41,462 --> 00:06:43,562
这个时候我们该怎么做
What do we do when someone's hurtin'?

153
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:46,532
给他们倒一杯热饮
Offer them a hot beverage.

154
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,032
而要是他们喝得跟个鬼似的
And when they're drunk as a skunk,

155
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,402
我们该给他们什么饮料
what beverage do we offer?

156
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,532
咖啡
Coffee.

157
00:06:51,532 --> 00:06:53,832
还得要怎样
And what do we do it with?

158
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:03,382
现在你给我听好
Now you listen to me.

159
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,452
我知道你感觉自己注定是剩男
I know you feel like you can't find someone,

160
00:07:06,452 --> 00:07:08,282
但每个问题都有解决方法
but there's a lock for every key.

161
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:10,782
以前有个在沃尔玛工作的女孩
Back home, there's a girl works at the Wal-Mart.

162
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,922
长得实在太高
Tall, tall girl.

163
00:07:12,922 --> 00:07:16,022
她用钉耙就能把鹅从空中打下来了
Woman could hunt geese with a rake.

164
00:07:16,232 --> 00:07:18,422
她觉得自己找不到男人
Thought she'd never find a man,

165
00:07:18,432 --> 00:07:20,132
但有一天  谁知道呢
then one day, wouldn't ya know,

166
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,562
Harlem Globetrotters 哈林环球旅行者篮球队

167
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:23,562
哈林篮球队的人来到镇上
Harlem Globetrotters come to town.

168
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:25,672
长话短说
Long story short,

169
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:27,872
现在这个女人和一个
today that woman travels the world

170
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:29,772
半职业篮球选手周游世界
with a semi-professional basketball player

171
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:32,942
还生了两个漂亮的混血宝宝
and two beautiful mixed-race babies.

172
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:37,252
虽然因为你的口音问题我没怎么听懂
I didn't get a lot of that because of your accent,

173
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:39,652
但你的语气很抚慰人心
but the general tone was soothing

174
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,252
我感觉好多了
and somehow I feel better.

175
00:07:42,452 --> 00:07:46,392
我吃不到核桃派了是吧
I'm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?

176
00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:48,562
你想来点奥利奥吗
You want some Oreos?

177
00:07:48,562 --> 00:07:50,162
-混合夹心的吗  -不是  普通的
- Double Stuf? - No, regular.

178
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:52,832
不错  真会在伤口上撒盐
Nice. Kick a man when he's down.

179
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:57,002
很高兴我们终于可以一起做点事情
I'm glad we're finally getting to do something together,

180
00:07:57,002 --> 00:07:58,872
-就我们两个人  -当然
- just the two of us.  - Sure.

181
00:07:58,872 --> 00:08:02,002
出来度假还有衣服要洗  真是开心啊
One thing you really miss when you're on vacation is laundry.

182
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,372
注意点  你松软剂放太多了
Careful, you're using too much Downey.

183
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,442
要是我衣服太柔软  我穿着会想睡觉的
You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy.

184
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:09,612
这让我想起了以前的日子
Well, this takes me back.

185
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:12,612
我帮你洗衣服  而你在旁边碎碎念
Me doing your laundry, you next to me criticizing.

186
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,622
很有爱吧
It is nice, isn't it?

187
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,312
库珀夫人
Mrs. Cooper.

188
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:20,512
你好  亲爱的
Oh, hello, darlin'.

189
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,862
谢尔顿  你都没告诉我你妈妈要来
Sheldon, you didn't tell me your mom was coming.

190
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:25,562
我在一周邮件集锦中写了的
It was in my weekly e-mail blast.

191
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,302
就在"甜菜季终于来了"
Right between "Beet season is finally here"

192
00:08:28,302 --> 00:08:32,832
和"神马  甜菜根会致癌"这两条中间
and "Uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."

193
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:37,612
你最近怎么样
So, how've you been?

194
00:08:37,612 --> 00:08:38,742
很好啊
Good, good.

195
00:08:38,742 --> 00:08:40,342
我听说莱纳德交了新女友
I hear that Leonard has a new girlfriend.

196
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:41,882
你感觉怎么样
How are you doing with all that?

197
00:08:41,882 --> 00:08:43,882
还好啦  已经过了一阵了
Oh, fine. You know, it's been a while.

198
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:45,612
我已经重新开始物色对象了
I'm getting back out there.

199
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,882
我多嘴问一句  你物色对象的时候
Let me ask you, when you get back out there,

200
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:50,482
不会是穿着这个吧
are you wearing this?

201
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,922
这个吊带超好看的
Well, it's super cute on.

202
00:08:53,922 --> 00:08:55,792
全靠它别人才免费请我喝酒
That top has paid for itself in free drinks

203
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,392
省下的酒钱都够买十件了
like ten times what it cost.

204
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,262
对  佩妮的钱基本都是靠滥交来的
Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures.

205
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,872
亲爱的  你也许该知道
Hon, you think maybe the reason

206
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,902
你一直找不到一个合适的人
why you're having trouble finding a guy to settle down with

207
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:11,112
是因为你总让男人们先"上"车
is because you're letting them ride the roller coaster

208
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:13,312
而不让他们掏一个子儿
without buying a ticket?

209
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,352
不是谁都有福分能"上"云霄飞车
Oh, they don't always get to ride the roller coaster.

210
00:09:17,352 --> 00:09:21,222
没福分的就只能在一旁  玩玩咖啡"杯"
Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups.

211
00:09:24,192 --> 00:09:25,352
我今晚要出去
Now I'm going out tonight.

212
00:09:25,352 --> 00:09:26,762
要是我请你帮我选衣服
Would it be crazy to ask you

213
00:09:26,762 --> 00:09:28,392
这样会不会太疯狂了
to look at the outfit I'm going to wear?

214
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:30,292
一点也不蠢
Oh, not crazy at all.

215
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:31,232
别看轻自己
And don't beat yourself up.

216
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,462
我像你这么大的时候
When I was your age, you could have me for a car ride

217
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,032
一瓶草莓酒就能骗我出去兜风了
and a bottle of strawberry wine.

218
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:44,342
我可不会把这个写进本周邮件集锦里
That will not be in this week's e-mail blast.

219
00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:46,872
今年春天
So, this spring,

220
00:09:46,882 --> 00:09:50,242
我要出发去国际空间站
I get to go to the International Space Station.

221
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:54,122
上帝啊  上天堂呀
Oh, my word, a trip to the heavens.

222
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:57,622
如果你想在那里定居
If you ever want to live there eternally,

223
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,892
我这有本好书你可以看看
I've got a good book you could read.

224
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,292
心领了  不过我每年都看《查理・布朗的圣诞节》特辑
Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year,

225
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:03,292
查理・布朗:史努比的主人

226
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,762
所以也不会无聊
so I get the gist.

227
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:07,602
-你妈妈肯定很以你为荣  -不
- I bet your mom is really proud of you. - Nope.

228
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:09,232
她说如果我不退出
She says if I don't back out

229
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:11,932
她就要绝食抗议
she's going to go on a hunger strike.

230
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:12,872
虽然离出现生命危险
It would take years before

231
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,902
得有好几年时间  但我还是于心不忍
she'd be in any kind of danger, but still.

232
00:10:16,112 --> 00:10:18,942
我们明天去好好玩一天  妈妈
I've got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom.

233
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:20,242
我要带你
I'm taking you

234
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,982
Saul Perlmutter 2011诺贝尔物理学家得主

235
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:22,982
去看索尔・珀尔马特演讲
to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture

236
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:24,982
他那赢得诺贝尔奖的宇宙学研究成果
about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology.

237
00:10:24,982 --> 00:10:26,312
但最精彩的部分是
And the best part is,

238
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:28,322
在后面的问答阶段
at the Q and A afterward,

239
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,852
我准备了几个问题
I've worked up a couple of "Q's"

240
00:10:29,852 --> 00:10:32,522
绝对能把他问哭
that will stump his sorry "A."

241
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:35,092
我不确定  谢利
I don't know, Shelly.

242
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,462
我觉得我们可以去观观光
I thought we could do a little sightseeing.

243
00:10:37,462 --> 00:10:39,932
有什么景色能与你儿子
What sight is better than your little boy

244
00:10:39,932 --> 00:10:42,532
让诺贝尔奖得主颜面扫地相媲美呢
embarrassing a Nobel laureate?

245
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,572
别这样  谢尔顿  我们可以带你妈
Come on, Sheldon, we'll take your mom

246
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:46,302
去看看好莱坞标志
to see the Hollywood sign,

247
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,142
参观蜡像馆  走走星光大道
the wax museum, the Walk of Fame.

248
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:50,202
也可以去逛逛罗迪欧大道[名牌商业街]
Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive.

249
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:53,072
一万二的手袋  我可买不起
Well, I can't spend $12,000 on a handbag,

250
00:10:53,082 --> 00:10:54,942
但用正义的眼光谴责那些
but it's free to look upon those

251
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:57,512
买得起的人  这倒是不用花钱的
who do with righteous condemnation.

252
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:00,682
你觉得怎么样
What do you say?

253
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:02,852
我觉得怎么样
What do I say?

254
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:05,592
我真心觉得我妈来探望我  关你们屁事
I say you people need to stop ruining my mom's visit

255
00:11:05,592 --> 00:11:08,292
去你的寿司  滚你的悲伤
with your sushi, and your sadness

256
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,492
还有你的放荡小吊带
and your slutty shirts.

257
00:11:09,492 --> 00:11:11,062
你们收手吧
Stop it.

258
00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:18,502
他不是说你  你的衣服密不透风
He's not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.

259
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:23,915
这真是美味啊
These are delicious.

260
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,215
煎薄饼的秘诀就是用培根油
The trick to pancakes is bacon grease.

261
00:11:26,225 --> 00:11:28,525
我做什么都放这油
I cook everything in it.

262
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:31,355
每样都放吗  你不怕有害健康吗
Everything? Aren't you worried about your health?

263
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:33,725
医生说话一向自相矛盾的
Oh, doctors are always changing their mind.

264
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,425
这个星期说你不能吃培根油
One week bacon grease is bad for you.

265
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:38,095
下个星期就说你吃得不够多
The next week we're not getting enough of it.

266
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,565
早上好  谢利
Good morning, Shelly.

267
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:45,535
妈妈  我要为我昨晚的行为道歉
Mom, I want to apologize for my behavior last night.

268
00:11:45,545 --> 00:11:47,305
-接受你的道歉  -太好了
- Apology accepted.  - Great.

269
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:49,845
你会喜欢珀尔马特的演讲的
Now, you're going to love the Perlmutter lecture.

270
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:53,915
他会说宇宙现在已有六千多年历史
Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years,

271
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:56,185
我觉得这时你可以用手指塞住耳朵
but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears

272
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:58,955
然后低声哼唱《奇异恩典》[基督教圣诗]
and hum "Amazing Grace" during those parts.

273
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,685
我还是要跟你朋友出去
I am still going out with your friends.

274
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:03,925
可我已经道歉了
But I apologized.

275
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:07,565
我容易吗我  我又没做错什么
And that was hard for me because I didn't do anything wrong.

276
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:13,395
谢利  从小到大  那些枯燥无味的演讲
Shelly, I hung out with you in enough dusty lecture halls

277
00:12:13,405 --> 00:12:14,705
我已经陪你听得够多了
while you were growing up.

278
00:12:14,705 --> 00:12:16,565
我现在要去观光
I want to go sightseeing.

279
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,005
你何不吃点煎薄饼
So why don't you have some pancakes,

280
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,635
穿好衣服  跟我们一起去
get dressed and come with us.

281
00:12:19,645 --> 00:12:22,775
我不去  你不能逼我
I'm not going, and you can't make me.

282
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:26,645
你说得对  我不能逼你  你自个儿玩得开心点
You're right, I can't. Have a nice day.

283
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:29,415
那我就一直站在这里  直到你回心转意
Well, I'm going to stand here until you change your mind.

284
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,685
那你就在那儿站一天吧
Well, then you are going to stand there all day.

285
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:38,555
我还是带上我的培根油闪一边去吧
I'm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.

286
00:12:38,555 --> 00:12:41,625
真没想到  我妈妈居然要抛弃我
I can't believe my own mother is abandoning me.

287
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,895
我没有要抛弃你
I am not abandoning you.

288
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,095
谢尔顿  要抛弃你  我早把你放篮子里
Sheldon, abandoning you is leaving you in a basket

289
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,465
扔教堂门口了
on a church doorstep.

290
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:52,135
我要去好莱坞  对着里根总统的蜡像说
I am going to Hollywood and thank a wax Ronald Reagan

291
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:54,445
感谢他对国家做的贡献
for his service to our country.

292
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:59,175
看来我们的母子关系处在十字路口了  妈妈
We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother.

293
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:00,815
看来如此
Well, I guess we are.

294
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,885
不好意思  忘了拿糖浆
Sorry. Syrup.

295
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:05,355
好吧  妈妈
All right, Mom.

296
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,325
等你进到"瑞普利信不信由你"博物馆
When you're at the Ripley's Believe It Or Not Museum,

297
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,325
在美国田纳西州  纪念Robert Ripley

298
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:11,725
如果那里有展出情愿扔掉大好机会
if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance

299
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:13,895
也不愿陪她的天才儿子玩一天的母亲
to spend the day with the world's most wonderful son,

300
00:13:13,895 --> 00:13:15,695
你要相信  因为真有这种妈妈
believe it, because it's true.

301
00:13:18,195 --> 00:13:20,535
我还没...
I hadn't...

302
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,535
听这场演讲真是浪费时间
That lecture was a waste of time.

303
00:13:24,535 --> 00:13:26,535
我还穿尿布的时候
I made more accurate diagrams

304
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,075
用尿布里的物体  在幼儿园墙上画的
of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall

305
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,075
早期宇宙膨胀图都比他的准
with the contents of my diaper.

306
00:13:33,015 --> 00:13:34,685
你是不是病了
Are you getting sick?

307
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:37,045
不是  只是对那些
No, I'm just allergic to people

308
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:39,885
平白无故就得诺贝尔奖的人过敏
who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason.

309
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,985
谢尔顿  你心情不好
Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood--

310
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:46,695
或者用临床术语说  嘴贱
or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness--

311
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:50,125
是因为你妈妈没有把你放在第一位
is because your mother isn't making you a priority?

312
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:55,105
不是  或者用临床术语说  我呸
No. Or to use the clinical term, "nuh-uh""

313
00:13:56,165 --> 00:13:58,135
你确定吗  母婴配对关系
Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond

314
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,475
是灵长类动物心理的基础
is the building block of primate psychology.

315
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:00,635
又来了
Oh, there it is.

316
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:02,645
什么东西到你嘴里都绕回猴子身上
It always comes back to monkeys with you.

317
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:05,575
除了猴子  还是猴子
Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys.

318
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,945
谢尔顿  人类也是动物
Sheldon, we're all animals.

319
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,485
虽然你有一些过人之处
And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary,

320
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,855
但说到情绪和人际关系
but when it comes to emotions and relationships,

321
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,255
你跟普通人没什么两样
you're just like everybody else.

322
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,355
你是说我的情绪问题
Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems

323
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:20,795
跟那些白痴没什么两样吗
are no different than those of a stupid person?

324
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,125
实际上  有些研究表明
Actually, some research indicates

325
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:24,465
不过分考虑的话
that by not overthinking,

326
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,595
智商较低的人  情绪控制得更好
the less intelligent handle emotions better.

327
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,175
你确定你不是感冒了吗
Sure you're not coming down with a cold?

328
00:14:31,175 --> 00:14:33,235
是啊是啊  就跟其他人一样
Oh, yes, the common cold.

329
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:34,405
得那种普通的感冒呀
Just like everyone else.

330
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:35,645
那样你就爽了  对吧
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

331
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:41,015
这间挺漂亮的嘛
Oh, this one's sweet.

332
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,755
对你们这种拿着念珠念经的人来说不错了
You know, for your rosary rattlers.

333
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,755
指天主教念玫瑰经时用一串念珠

334
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:49,955
库珀太太  那些是天主教徒  不是"拿着念珠念经的人"
Mrs. Cooper, we say "Catholics" not "rosary rattlers".

335
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,245
上帝啊  加利福尼亚怎么这么多条条框框
My goodness, it's a wonder you people in California

336
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,455
还让不让人讲话了
can talk at all.

337
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,695
这真是史上最烂的好莱坞之旅了
This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.

338
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,765
咱有什么办法  谁叫她非要逛教堂呢
What are we gonna do? She wanted to see churches.

339
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:01,505
教堂里有酒的  对吧
Hey, they have wine here, don't they?

340
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:07,745
我们印度的神可没有这么强壮的腹肌
None of our gods have abs like that.

341
00:15:07,745 --> 00:15:10,875
没错  这是最后一个坚持做仰卧起坐的犹太人
Yep, that's the last Jew who did sit-ups.

342
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:14,315
可你看看他的下场
And look where it got him.

343
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:18,855
既然咱们都来了  何不一块祷告呢
Hey, while we're here, why don't we all do some praying?

344
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,885
给这个教堂也添点教堂的气氛嘛
Let's put a little church in this church.

345
00:15:20,885 --> 00:15:22,425
我觉得我们不...
Oh, I'm not sure we should...

346
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:24,525
很简单的  我教你
It's easy. I'll show you how.

347
00:15:24,525 --> 00:15:26,195
主啊  玛丽・库珀在此
Lord, Mary Cooper here.

348
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,595
我从加利福尼亚州的蛾摩拉城前来膜拜
Coming to you from Gomorrah, California.

349
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:29,595
蛾摩拉城是圣经中的罪恶之都

350
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,335
我想感谢您
I want to thank you

351
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:34,035
保佑我的小宝贝谢利
for the blessing that is my little Shelly.

352
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:36,965
我还想感谢您一直赐予我宽容的力量
I also want to thank you for the continued strength

353
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:39,935
我才没用圣经把他给拍晕
not to coldcock him with my Bible.

354
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:43,705
好了  佩妮  到你了
All right, Penny, your turn.

355
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:45,475
好吧
Okay, um...

356
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:46,475
好呀  上帝
Hey, God.

357
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,215
最近咋样啊
What's up?

358
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,955
我挺好的  但是
Um, I'm good, but, uh,

359
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,655
您要是能阻止我哥造冰毒的话
it would be a big help to my family

360
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,855
那就是帮了我们家大忙了
if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth.

361
00:15:57,495 --> 00:16:00,195
但是别惊动警察  私下解决就好
But no cops. Be cool.

362
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:04,295
她还有点太爱她的邻居了
She also goes a little overboard

363
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:05,635
都爱上床了
on the "love thy neighbor" .

364
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:09,165
或许可以像解救抹大拉的玛丽亚那样帮帮她
Could probably use that chat you had with Mary Magdalene.

365
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:09,165
被耶稣解救的妓女

366
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:10,575
莱纳德  到你了
Leonard, you're up.

367
00:16:10,575 --> 00:16:12,535
那个叫沃什么的  你做好准备
Wasserman, you're on deck.

368
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:14,845
好吧  说啥呢
Okay. I don't know...

369
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:19,315
现在再求你让我长高点  可能有点太晚了
it's probably a little late to ask you to make me taller.

370
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:26,515
对了  也许你可以帮帮我和我的女朋友
Oh, um...if you could help out with me and my girlfriend.

371
00:16:26,525 --> 00:16:28,655
她现在远在印度  你要是能帮我们一下就好了
She's all the way in India. That would be great.

372
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,025
听见没  恋情烦恼
Hear that? Girl trouble.

373
00:16:30,025 --> 00:16:32,995
看来我们都没想到莱纳德也能交上女朋友
Turns out we were both wrong on that front.

374
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:37,195
-你呢  -我
- How about you?  - Oh, me?

375
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,565
不用了  我没啥愿望
No. Thanks, I'm good.

376
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:42,235
我只盼着宇宙飞船别突然爆炸就行
I'm really just trying not to burst into flames.

377
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,375
拉杰呢
Rajesh?

378
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,815
他说他那最后的五磅体重
He says he's having trouble

379
00:16:50,815 --> 00:16:52,945
怎么都减不下去
dropping those last five pounds.

380
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:57,145
要是我就求主解决  我不敢跟女孩子讲话的问题
Huh, I might have gone with the talking-to-girls thing.

381
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,355
不行  你一次只能许一个愿
No, you only get one wish.

382
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:18,175
美国著名演员  Martin Sheen

383
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:21,175
看看咱俩
Look at the two of us.

384
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:24,205
我  一位受人尊敬的物理学家
Me, a highly regarded physicist.

385
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:26,345
一两代人里才偶然出现一个的
The kind of mind that comes along once,

386
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,385
超级高智商
maybe twice in a generation.

387
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:30,885
你呢  就是个普通人
You, the common man,

388
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:34,525
股票经纪  要不就是吸尘机销售员
tired from your labors as a stockbroker,

389
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:38,525
再不然就是个擦皮鞋的  累得半死刚下班
or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack.

390
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,865
但是内心深处
But deep down inside...

391
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:45,435
咱俩也就是一丘之貉
apparently we're just two peas in a pod.

392
00:17:45,435 --> 00:17:48,605
只不过你是个普通的貉
A regular pea,

393
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:51,205
而我是个一两代才出那么一个的
and the kind of pea that comes along once,

394
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,435
高等貉
maybe twice in a generation.

395
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,975
下雨了
Rain.

396
00:17:58,985 --> 00:18:01,485
又一个象征着众人平等的标志
Another great equalizer.

397
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:03,315
雨浇在我这个天才头上
Falling on the head of the brilliant

398
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,315
也浇在你这个凡人头上
and the unremarkable alike.

399
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,865
真有先见之明
Smarty-pants.

400
00:18:18,165 --> 00:18:20,495
库珀太太  你做的饭太香了
Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good.

401
00:18:20,505 --> 00:18:21,835
记着我的话  亲爱的
You take notes, darlin'.

402
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,165
拴住一个男人真正的秘诀就是给他做
The real way to get a man is with melted cheese

403
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:26,035
融化的奶酪和奶油蘑菇汤
and cream of mushroom soup.

404
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:29,505
虽然他五十岁就挂掉  但在那之前绝对会全心爱你
He'll die at 50 but his love will be true.

405
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,415
给我张纸巾  这张湿了
I need a tissue. This one got wet.

406
00:18:39,715 --> 00:18:40,955
给你
Here.

407
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:44,455
谢谢  我今天学到东西了
Thank you. Yeah, I've learned something today.

408
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:48,365
你和我  在很多方面
You and I, in so many ways,

409
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:49,835
除了智商和其他重要方面
other than intelligence and what counts,

410
00:18:49,835 --> 00:18:51,635
其实没什么不同
we're the same

411
00:18:53,905 --> 00:18:57,205
-亲爱的  你生病了吗  -但愿如此
- Sweetheart, are you sick? - I hope so.

412
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:59,475
如果这都不叫生病  那活着还有什么意义
because if this is well, life isn't worth living.

413
00:18:59,475 --> 00:19:02,775
宝贝儿  你发烧了
Oh, sugarpie, you are burning up.

414
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,015
-赶快上床躺着去吧  -好吧
- We've got to get you to bed.  - Okay.

415
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:07,475
别担心  妈妈来照顾小宝贝儿
Don't worry. Mama's here to take care of her baby.

416
00:19:07,485 --> 00:19:11,515
咱先说清楚  你只照顾自己的宝贝儿
And just to be clear, only her baby

417
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:12,815
而不是所有这些宝贝儿对吧
and not these other people.

418
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:14,825
那当然
Of course.

419
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:16,455
我想喝蜂蜜茶
Can I have tea with honey

420
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,155
吃去边的三明治  可以吗
and toast with the crust cut off?

421
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:20,825
你想吃什么都行
You can have whatever you want.

422
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:23,565
谢谢妈妈  你最好了
Thanks, Mom. You're the best.

423
00:19:30,812 --> 00:19:33,472
天啊  上次我帮你涂药膏的时候
Boy, last time I put VapoRub on you,

424
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,382
你还没长出胸毛来呢
you didn't have hair on your chest.

425
00:19:36,382 --> 00:19:39,582
是啊  去年才长出来的
I know, it filled in last year.

426
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:44,652
你这次来  我都没跟你在一起待多久
I didn't get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit.

427
00:19:44,652 --> 00:19:46,652
这是谁的错啊
And whose fault was that?

428
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:49,622
你的错
Yours.

429
00:19:50,992 --> 00:19:53,162
谢利  你已经不再是个八岁的小孩子了
Shelly, you're not eight years old anymore.

430
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:55,032
咱俩之间的关系不能跟以前一样了
We have to have a different relationship.

431
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,002
不要
No, we don't.

432
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,732
咱俩之前那样就挺好的呀
The one we have works great.

433
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:00,232
亲爱的  你是个大人了
Sweetheart, you are a grown man.

434
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:02,672
没准我是个
Or maybe I'm part of a new species,

435
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:04,572
寿命长达上百年的新物种呢
that lives for hundreds of years,

436
00:20:04,572 --> 00:20:07,282
也就是说我现在还是个两三岁的孩子呢
which means I'm still basically a toddler.

437
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,242
我当年真应该带你去休斯顿
Oh, I so should have taken you to Houston.

438
00:20:14,462 --> 00:20:16,882
也就是说你不会唱《乖乖猫》给我听了吗
