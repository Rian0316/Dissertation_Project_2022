I'm sorry?
你说什么呢?

5
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,060

So,do you find the weather satisfying?

Please don't do that.
你行行好 别

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,230
All right,but I'm given to understand that when
you have something awkward to discuss with someone,
好吧  但我以为当你准备与某人
交谈尴尬之事前

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,030
it's more palatable to preface
it with banal chit chat.
先用闲聊做些铺垫会自在一些

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,110
So,this wasn't the awkward part?
尴尬的部分还没到?

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,910

Okay,feeling the awkward now.

Anyway,should you have
any interaction with her,

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,140
it would be most helpful that
she not see you as a sexual rival.

You're sitting in your
apartment,it's late,you're alone.
可当你夜深独居闺房 孤枕难眠

35

雌激素和孕酮刺激你的下丘脑
使你饥渴难耐

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,920
and suddenly even Leonard seems
like a viable sexual candidate.
就连Leonard也突然成为
适合的交配对象了

Well,Stephanie,since Leonard seems to

138
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:19,490
Ergo,you have no say in anything
that happens between me and Stephanie.
所以说 我和Stephanie的事
都轮不到你来插嘴

139
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:24,500
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
很抱歉 恐怕我不能放任不管

140

Pursuant to Starfleet
General Order 104,Section A:
根据星际舰队总则104条A款

This is a door knob.

It's my understanding that an unsolicited
gift of food can be a precursor

150
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,040
to an impromptu invitation
to come in and chat.

151

Sheldon,what do you want?

I'm certain this will
come as no surprise to you,

emotional cap in his buttocks.

- What?
- Again,urban slang.

165
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,870
In which,I believe I'm
gaining remarkable fluency.
我觉得我已经说的很溜了

166
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,660
So,what is the "down" and the "low"?

167
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,040
And don't worry,this is
all entirely confidential,

Oh,okay,all right,you know what?

We were young,we were very much in love,

却只能守在湖边小屋
用一个穿越时空的信箱互相通信

that movie,but now you mock me with it?
你逼着我看了那电影还不够

way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.

And the three hour dinner with Penny.

should have ended after 20 minutes.

Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.

How do we circumvent
his inevitable rejection?

commercial where the women undress when they smell it.
不要往他身上喷广告里那种香水
女人一闻到立马脱衣服那个

198
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,730
That doesn't work at all.
一点都不管用

199

No matter how much you put on.
不管你往身上喷多少

- May I come in?
- No.
- 我能进来吗

208
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:38,030
I see. Apparently,my earlier inquiry regarding
you and Leonard crossed some sort of line.

I've been doing some research
online,and apparently female primates,

you know,uh,apes,chimpanzees,you.
呃 像猿类 黑猩猩 还有你

217

They find their mate more desirable when
he's being courted by another female.
当雄性配偶被其他雌性包围时
对他们的欲望会显著提高

218
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,860
Now,this effect is intensified
when the rival female

219
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,720
is secreting the pheromones
associated with ovulation.

question.Where are you in your--

221
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:20,160
Clearly,I'm 14 days too early.
看样子 她大姨妈还有14天才来

222
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,150
All I'm saying is if they can
cure yellow fever and malaria,

223
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,120
why can't they do something
about lactose intolerance?
咋就不想办法治治不耐乳糖症呢?

Leonard,you're going
to have to let this go.

What are you doing?

I have a craving for white asparagus that
apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.

232
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,070
Excuse me.
失陪下

233
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,640
What the hell is wrong with you?

I'm helping you with Stephanie.

By making constipated moose sounds?

When I fail to open this jar and you succeed,it
will establish you as the "alpha" male.
我开不了这瓶罐头 而你能打开
就可以树立你的猛男形象

237
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,920
You see...when a female witnesses
an exhibition of physical domination,
是这样的...
当雄性在雌性面前展现肌肉

238
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,000
she produces the hormone oxytocin.
雌性会释放荷尔蒙催产素

239
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,770
If the two of you then
engage in intercourse,
如果你俩之后进行性交

240
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,080
this will create the
biochemical reaction in the brain
大脑里会产生生化反应

241
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,490
which lay people naively
interpret as "falling in love."
普通人会天真地以为是"相爱了"

242
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,110
Would it work if I just
punched you in the face?
那揍你一拳能不能达到效果?

243
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,940
Yes,actually it would,but
let's see how the lid goes.
嗯 应该可以
但我们还是拧盖子吧

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,180
I'm not strong
enough,Leonard,you'll have to do it.

it,and that's not surprising.
是的 是的 他能搞定 没啥意外的

250
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,770
This is something I long ago came to
peace with in my role as the beta male.
我早就安分于自己的小弟身份

251
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,200

Like a gladiator!

FYI,I was defrosting a steak in there.

What a beautiful job Stephanie did.
Stephanie的活干得真漂亮

261
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,580
I might have gone with a mattress
suture instead of a blanket stitch,
虽然我更喜欢褥式缝合法
而不是毯边锁缝针法

262
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,970
but you can' argue with her results.

263
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,780
It's a shame it won't scar.
