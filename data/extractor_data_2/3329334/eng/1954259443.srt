00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,339
Previously on "The Originals"...

2
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:02,409
You're Klaus' father?

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,803
You can bring me back to life.

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,220
Welcome to my hell.

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,830
You're all right.

6
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,749
Have you dreamt of our father?

7
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,799
I saw Mikael.

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
I've been dreaming of him, too.

9
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,039
Your mother was clearly a very gifted witch.

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,259
Any way I do the math,

11
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,879
it ends with me and my guys dead,

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,157
So whatever it is you got coming with the wolves,

13
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:23,492
just know that I will fight until I am dead!

14
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,608
Nice job.

15
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:32,480
You saved me the trouble of killing all these vampires myself.

16
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:37,040
That baby is part witch.

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:40,009
She has to be born first before she can die.

18
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,609
No!

19
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,699
This the way it had to be.

20
00:00:41,764 --> 00:00:43,455
No!

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,451
Writing a love letter to one of your many suitors?

22
00:00:56,743 --> 00:00:59,270
So who's the lucky recipient then--

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,284
Jackson or Elijah?

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,914
Don't tell me it's me.

25
00:01:06,944 --> 00:01:09,300
I thought I was out of the running ages ago.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,394
And the award for biggest ego goes to...

27
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:16,728
Oh...

28
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:23,177
How is our littlest wolf?

29
00:01:24,436 --> 00:01:26,342
Do you want to...

30
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,532
Come on.

31
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,438
You feel that?

32
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,647
Right.

33
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:04,621
I'll leave you to your secret letter then.

34
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,334
"Dear Zoey...

35
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,960
"or Caitlin or Angela.

36
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,365
"To my little girl,

37
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,097
"your dad just asked if this was a love letter.

38
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:28,877
I guess it kind of is."

39
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,642
"I never got to know my mother.

40
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:38,060
"I have no idea what she must have felt when she carried me."

41
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,447
Let go of me, you bitch!

42
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,500
"So I thought I'd write to you

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,936
"so that you could know how happy I am at this very moment,

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,363
"Hh your father and I can't wait to meet you."

45
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:56,551
"And I want to make you a promise,

46
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,659
"3 things that you will have that I never did--

47
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,266
"A safe home,

48
00:03:02,388 --> 00:03:06,604
"someone to tell you that they love you every single day,

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,609
and someone to fight for you no matter what."

50
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,420
"In other words, a family.

51
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,271
"So there you go, baby girl.

52
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:19,020
"The rest we're gonna have to figure out together.

53
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:29,289
You should know this brings me no joy.

54
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:31,861
I promise I'll make it quick.

55
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:34,080
Let's begin, shall we?

56
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,604
No, no!

Oh, god. What happened?

62
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,070
Klaus.

63
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,420
They fought, and he got bit.

64
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:00,790
Marcel.

65
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,227
It's ok. I gave as good as I got,

66
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,717
but we need klaus' blood to heal.

67
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,747
You fought Klaus.

68
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,350
Did he bleed?

69
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,140
I got him pretty good, yeah.

70
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,401
Where?

71
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,430
Venez sanguis. Venez sanguis.

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,743
- Venez sanguis. Venez-- - Uh, Davina.

73
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,010
What the hell?

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,129
Josh, what are you doing here?

75
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,398
I told you to rest.

76
00:04:49,428 --> 00:04:50,490
I'm fine.

77
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,160
You're gonna start hallucinating soon.

78
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,739
I mean, unless I'm hallucinating you standing

79
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,177
in the middle of the street and chanting for no reason.

80
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,144
Wait. Am I?

81
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,463
I'm gonna save you.
I'm gonna save all of you.

82
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,560
Venez sanguis. Venez sanguis.

83
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,330
Venez sanguis. Venez sanguis.

84
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,870
Venez sanguis. Venez sanguis.

85
00:05:25,812 --> 00:05:29,680
Ok. I am hallucinating.

86
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,110
I will bring hell to your doorstep!

87
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,674
One last push. The baby's almost here.

88
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:35,840
I will bathe in rivers of your blood!

89
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,872
- No, no! - I can see the baby!

90
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,872
Ok. Now push.

91
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:41,363
Gently, gently.

92
00:05:41,393 --> 00:05:43,190
You will die screaming!

93
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,269
There.

94
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,442
You have a beautiful baby daughter.

95
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,049
We must start the sacrifice

96
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,224
as soon as the moon sets with the morning sky.

97
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,579
Please. Please can I hold her?

98
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,626
No!

99
00:07:04,065 --> 00:07:05,286
Hayley!

100
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,248
Oh, no...

101
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:22,633
No.

102
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,202
She's gone.

103
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:03,287
You've been bitten.

104
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:21,248
There's only enough here for one.

105
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,337
No. This has to be enough!

106
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:41,958
I... I can't choose.

107
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:45,207
Please don't make me choose.

108
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,161
Save your friend.

109
00:08:54,697 --> 00:08:56,303
I can take care of the rest of us.

110
00:08:56,528 --> 00:08:57,683
Marcel.

111
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:59,669
- I can't.
- Judging by the look of that bite,

112
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,010
You don't have time to argue.

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,327
Marcel.

114
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,190
Josh is one of my guys,

115
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:07,450
and enough of my guys have died today,

116
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,528
So come on.

117
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,650
One point for you

118
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,590
And one point for Niklaus.

119
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,400
Where do you think you're going?

120
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,639
To find Klaus, get his blood,

121
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,470
and save as many of my guys as I can.

122
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,893
Wait.

123
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,274
For that, you'll need a weapon,

124
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,920
and it just so happens I have an arsenal.

125
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,915
How?

126
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,155
I was bested.

127
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,818
You were bested?

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,461
You... Were bested?!

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,672
My invincible brother?

130
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,880
They took the baby, but there's still time.

131
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,890
We can save her.

132
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,089
The tombs are empty, the grounds are deserted.

133
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,120
She's not here.
This is the only place they can be.

134
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,209
- We'll keep searching. - They are not here, Niklaus.

135
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,429
We're wasting time.

136
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,889
Their harvest was here,
the reaping was here.

137
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,409
They are about to perform a ritual

138
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,349
which will feed their ancestors for centuries,

139
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,101
ancestors who are buried here!

140
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,430
This statue.

141
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,279
We've passed by this 3 times.

142
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,716
We were going in the same direction.

143
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,540
They have fabricated some kind of illusion.

144
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,094
That's one word for it.

145
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,890
So this is what Kieran was hiding.

146
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,430
More like stockpiling.

147
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,612
From what I can gather, it's mostly weapons.

148
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,680
Dark objects created by witches.

149
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,708
And co-opted by the humans.

150
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,449
Kieran's been keeping this a secret for years.

151
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,460
You really sure you want to show me all this?

152
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,030
You said knowing my uncle's secrets could get me killed.

153
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,030
What if those same secrets could save the lives of my friends?

154
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,210
Look at this.

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,279
I learned about it in the lycée.

156
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,240
It's called the devil's star.

157
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,710
They say one throw can make a thousand cuts.

158
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,340
A thousand cuts sounds about right.

159
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,220
I need to make Klaus bleed.

160
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,330
It's ingenious.

161
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,110
I can see them, I can feel them,
and yet they are not real.

162
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,480
There has to be a way.

163
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,865
Even if we could just push through.

164
00:12:46,895 --> 00:12:48,569
What we need to do is focus.

165
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,139
My only focus right now is that child

166
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,919
and her safety, do you understand me?

167
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,780
This, all of this,

168
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,039
this is the world that you created, Niklaus.

169
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,870
Brother. All of your scheming,

170
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,039
the enemies that you have made every single day of your miserable life.

171
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,019
What results did you expect?

172
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,259
That your child would be born into a happy life,

173
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,370
that the mother would be alive
to know her daughter,

174
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,300
that we could live and thrive as some sort of family?

175
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,300
That was your fantasy, brother, not mine!

176
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,707
No, brother.

177
00:13:15,176 --> 00:13:16,923
This was our hope.

178
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,867
This was our family's hope,

179
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,869
and now she is gone.

180
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,549
Do you understand? I...

181
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,195
let this person in.

182
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,440
I let her in.

183
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,550
I don't let people in.

184
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,831
You knew this,
and you've taken her from me.

185
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,690
I needed her, and you've broken me.

186
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,589
You can tell your niece

187
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,533
how much you cared for her mother

188
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,996
when we save her.

189
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,420
Push!

190
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,686
No!

191
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,930
The moon has almost faded from the morning sky.

192
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,518
I need to prepare.

193
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,360
She'll go through with it.

194
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,190
The ancestors promised her her life.

195
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,899
What about their promise to us?

196
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,920
4 harvest girls sacrificed, 4 girls returned,

197
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,199
but her friends hijack it,

198
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,013
and ours have to stay dead?

199
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,241
Cassie was our friend.

200
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,469
I hope she doesn't go through with it.

201
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,929
Then you and I can do what the ancestors want,

202
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:48,009
and they'll give us Cassie...

203
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,410
and drag Genevieve back to where she came from.

204
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:35,619
It says I need to channel power from a nexus vorti.

205
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,564
Ah, yes.

206
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:42,149
My wife Esther always did love to dress things up a bit.

207
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,839
It's fancy witch speak.

208
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,310
Nexus vorti-- a rare occurrence,

209
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,240
something so infrequent
it's almost a miracle

210
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,100
like an astrological event or...

211
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,207
A miracle baby.

212
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,272
Voila!

213
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,970
So are you certain that you have the power to bring me back?

214
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,292
I do now.

215
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,950
De la cendre ?L'os, de la chair ?La vie.

216
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,611
We've passed through here twice already.

217
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,832
We're running out of time.

218
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,237
Then we move faster.

219
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,237
Or smarter.

220
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:05,708
Hayley.

221
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,662
Hayley.

222
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,070
How are you here?

223
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,850
I woke up in the church.

224
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,213
I felt this hunger.

225
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,892
I knew what I needed.

226
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,015
I can feel her.

227
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,786
She's here.

228
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,026
I can feel my baby.

229
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,460
You died with the baby's blood still in your system.

230
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,228
She's in transition.

231
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,689
Which means she has to drink the blood of the child

232
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,281
if she's to survive.

233
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,530
To be reborn a hybrid.

234
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,524
I don't care about me.

235
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,430
I'm gonna go find our daughter.

236
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,950
No!

237
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,030
You fools.

238
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,289
to come against us in our place of power,

239
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,193
in our strongest hour.

240
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,996
You do not face 3.

241
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,260
You face us all.

242
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,388
Who the hell are you?

243
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,860
No!

244
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,300
No!

245
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,805
I was too late.

246
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,286
There should have been more time.

247
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,714
Looks like the wolves came back and finished what they started.

248
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,651
You took my daughter so I would heal you and your friends.

249
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,890
Here.

250
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,722
This bite...

251
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,700
All this...

252
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,211
I know it didn't come from nowhere.

253
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,966
This is the last note in a song

254
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,927
that I started a century ago...

255
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,034
when I brought your dad to town...

256
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,771
And for that, I am sorry.

257
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,689
No.

258
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:26,152
You saved my child's life, Marcel.

259
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,436
For that,

260
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,573
you deserve this.

261
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,935
We will take down

262
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:46,053
whoever brought this upon us.

263
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,533
I swear it.

264
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,239
May I?

265
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,400
Hey there.

266
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,989
Stop!

267
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,700
No.

268
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,160
Why is this happening?

269
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,210
You brought me back to kill my son.

270
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,000
I brought you back to punish him,

271
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,919
and you will when I'm ready and not a minute before.

272
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,210
What...have...you...done?

273
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,910
I added a little something extra in the spell that brought you back.

274
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,352
I spent 8 months of my life up here being used as a secret weapon.

275
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:27,476
Now you can see how it feels.

276
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,820
Kneel.

277
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:40,864
Why?

278
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,879
The ancestors left me no choice.

279
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,479
You were willing to sacrifice

280
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,529
an innocent baby for more power.

281
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,315
Oh, not just power.

282
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:50,747
It was the ancestors' decree.

283
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,690
It was her decree.

284
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,079
It was whose decree?

285
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,395
I'm surprised you have to ask

286
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,659
after all, you were the one who convinced

287
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,198
your siblings to consecrate her in New Orleans soil.

288
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,005
Esther.

289
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,440
So not even death can stop my mother from seeking the annihilation

290
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,448
of her own flesh and blood.

291
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,589
This isn't the end.

292
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,489
As long as that child lives, the witches of New Orleans

293
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,590
will never stop coming for it.

294
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,835
Esther will never stop coming for it.

295
00:27:31,366 --> 00:27:32,756
It has been decreed.

296
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,069
Your baby will be consecrated among her ancestors.

297
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,753
She will not live.

298
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,933
They're coming for me.

299
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,830
I can feel it.

300
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,642
I've failed them.

301
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,426
Please. Understand, I just wanted to live.

302
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,276
Tell Klaus...

303
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,829
I'm sorry.

304
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:09,074
I'm not.

305
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,833
We should have felt our mother's hand in this.

306
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,839
We should have known she would not be bound

307
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,869
by anything as obvious as death,

308
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,000
and now she has control of the witches.

309
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,110
- They will never stop. - No.

310
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,389
Nor would I expect the Guerrera wolves to back down.

311
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,482
Hayley and the child are wolf royalty,

312
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,899
and as such, they are a threat

313
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,110
to Francesca's claim to leadership.

314
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,820
They will never be safe.

315
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,548
What was it you said to me earlier,

316
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:57,359
that I've made enemies every day of my miserable life?

317
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,414
Well, the worst of them are within these borders, brother.

318
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,329
I have brought into the world a weapon they can use against me.

319
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,140
Then we will arm ourselves.

320
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,499
Brother, we've fought every adversary in this town,

321
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,090
and we have won,

322
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,740
and we'll fight them again,

323
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,980
no matter who they are.

324
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,850
We'll make this home a fortress.

325
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,819
I will not have her live her life as a prisoner.

326
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,410
Then we leave here together, all of us.

327
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,125
Wherever we go,

328
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,369
however far we run,

329
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,370
those who seek power and revenge will hunt us,

330
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,889
they will hunt her.

331
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,939
She has inherited all our enemies with none of our defenses.

332
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,540
So whether we stay or we leave,

333
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,839
we condemn her.

334
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,975
There is a third option.

335
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,592
I grew up in a war zone.

336
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,245
My parents thought they could protect me,

337
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,619
but in the end, they were slaughtered,

338
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,562
and I spent my childhood alone and unloved.

339
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,920
I made a promise to my baby and to myself...

340
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,423
That she would not grow up like I did,

341
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,500
that she would grow up safe and loved,

342
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,330
and yet here she is on her first day in this world

343
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:23,527
with a grandmother that is bent on sacrificing her

344
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,249
and a mother that has to drink the blood

345
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,604
of her own baby to survive transitioning into a hybrid,

346
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,316
and I'm the one that loves her the most.

347
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:45,987
I think the only thing to do is

348
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,850
send her away while we stay behind

349
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,007
and clean up the mess that we've made.

350
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,170
No. This is insane.

351
00:30:57,479 --> 00:30:58,935
You heard Genevieve.

352
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,400
So long as she lives, that baby will be hunted.

353
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,822
Not if on one knows she lives.

354
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,430
What is it that you intend to do, brother?

355
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,357
Whatever it takes

356
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,899
to save our family.

357
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,770
Today begins a new day in the quarter.

358
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:28,808
My family, long-time residents of this great community,

359
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,949
pledges to help every citizen recover

360
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,060
from the terrible outbreak of gang violence

361
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,860
that erupted on the streets of our city last night.

362
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,849
We will rebuild.

363
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:43,630
We will remember those who perished

364
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,789
as we seek to disinfect this town of its worst elements.

365
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,370
We will work together

366
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,980
to ensure the heart of the Crescent city

367
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,740
thrives again.

368
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,574
Last man standing, huh?

369
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,280
I'm interested in making a deal.

370
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,049
Don't look like you got much to offer.

371
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,939
I'm hearing word that the Guerreras want

372
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,900
the quarter to be a no vampire zone.

373
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,119
I can make that happen

374
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,919
in exchange for you leaving us alone

375
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,530
across the river, or...

376
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,383
I can unleash hell on your new wolf pack.

377
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,089
And how can you do that?

378
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,780
Easy. I made my peace with Klaus.

379
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,590
He cured me.

380
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,159
So now it's you versus us.

381
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Klaus...

382
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,690
is a warmonger.

383
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,310
You think he's gonna choose to side

384
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,940
with a pack of scrawny vamps

385
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,854
or an army of the new wolf breed that he created?

386
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,493
I'm thinking he's gonna side with us,

387
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,430
especially after he finds out

388
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,173
that your pack killed his kid.

389
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,096
What?

390
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,329
Open the box

391
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,409
and let me know what you think

392
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,149
Klaus will believe about who's responsible

393
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,547
for what you find inside of it.

394
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,583
Cremation may be the best way to go

395
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,428
before Klaus smells it on you.

396
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,337
Klaus.

397
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,573
Your baby?

398
00:34:16,404 --> 00:34:17,520
She died

399
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,371
a few hours after the Guerrera attack.

400
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,610
This is...

401
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,319
This is all my fault.

402
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,939
I can assure you it is not.

403
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,280
No. If I hadn't hesitated,

404
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,659
I could have uncovered Francesca's plot

405
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,619
in time to stop it.

406
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,619
And how would you have stopped the coven of witches

407
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,427
in league with her?

408
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,864
No.

409
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,540
If anyone is to blame, I am.

410
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,303
I am so...so sorry.

411
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,806
Camille...

412
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,683
I appreciate you being here,

413
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,096
but we cannot be friends.

414
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:06,270
What?

415
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,740
You had me pegged from the start,

416
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,779
a man damaged by his demons,

417
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,189
and those demons are not dormant.

418
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,395
They are hell-bent on killing me
and everything I find beautiful...

419
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,748
And you...

420
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,020
You are beautiful.

421
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,240
- Please, please just go. - Klaus.

422
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,754
Go.

423
00:35:58,376 --> 00:36:00,270
Did Marcel play his part?

424
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,629
He managed to locate a stillborn baby

425
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:05,110
in a hospital in upstate Louisiana.

426
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,799
I trust he agreed to the terms.

427
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,779
He has agreed to allow me to compel him

428
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,844
to forget what he knows of my child.

429
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:15,029
In exchange, he wants vials of my blood.

430
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,892
The witches will have to believe this.

431
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,691
Soon that fourth harvest girl will resurrect.

432
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:22,620
The coven will rebuild.

433
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,699
If they sense that your child lives,

434
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,979
they will hunt her.

435
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,998
The witches will buy what we sell.

436
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,814
We just have to sell it properly.

437
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,932
Then all that remains is to say good-bye.

438
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,283
They will be watching us,

439
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,631
all of them.

440
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,723
The 3 of us leaving together will draw too much attention.

441
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,224
I will go alone.

442
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,084
Take your mourning public while I'm gone.

443
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,587
I don't imagine that will be too difficult.

444
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,675
Grief, after all, is grief.

445
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,400
In what world will she be safe without us?

446
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:07,374
Who can protect her better than we?

447
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:10,650
There is one person.

448
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,729
Hello, sister.

449
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,540
She looks like her mother.

450
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,490
Maybe there is a god after all.

451
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,300
Well, she has a hint of the devil in her eyes.

452
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:48,802
That's all me.

453
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:54,900
You'll need a witch you can trust

454
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,558
to cast a cloaking spell.

455
00:38:56,588 --> 00:38:57,639
I'll get one.

456
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,119
No one can ever find her.

457
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,699
I know what to do, Nik.

458
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,042
Perhaps we'll get a white fence.

459
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,878
I think that would be lovely.

460
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:23,305
This city would have seen you dead,

461
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,329
but I will have it your home,

462
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:33,490
and every soul who wishes you harm
will be struck down.

463
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,534
Just as sure as my blood runs in your veins,

464
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,570
you will return to me.

465
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:06,689
In spite of our differences, Rebekah,

466
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,390
there is no one I would trust more with my daughter's life.

467
00:40:16,823 --> 00:40:19,912
Be happy...sister.

468
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,205
She will be happy, Nik, I promise.

469
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:27,413
What's her name?

470
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,280
Hope.

471
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,790
Her name is Hope.

472
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:27,217
May you rest in peace.

473
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,184
What's the fun in that?

474
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,447
Come along.

475
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,775
We have much to do.

476
00:41:37,506 --> 00:41:38,858
Yes, mother.

477
00:41:39,068 --> 00:41:44,692
