00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,120
- Hi. No. Maeve?
- Okay. Yeah?

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
I was gonna text you to apologize,
but that felt pathetic. Can we maybe talk?

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,520
I don't really have time right now.
I think I found my mum, so...

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
- Do you need any help?
- It's okay. I'll let you know how it goes.

183
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
[mischievous music playing]

184
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,000
What are we apologizing for?

185
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Okay, okay.

186
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,080
So, in France,

187
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,080
and please don't freak out, but...

188
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,680
Maeve and I kissed.

189
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,960
You okay?

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm actually speechless.

191
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,480
What kind of kiss?
A peck-on-the-cheek kissÂ or a kiss-kiss?

192
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,600
[splutters] Um, it was a kiss-kiss.

193
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,480
What happened after this kiss-kiss?
Are you guys a couple now?

194
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,280
No. I messed it all up again.

195
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
She thinks I don't care about anything
now I don't do the clinic.

196
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,240
You think that's true?

197
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,680
You don't do the clinic anymore

198
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,920
because you had your heart broken,
and you couldn't be around Maeve.

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,560
I don't think you stopped caring.
I think you had to protect yourself.

200
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,720
Please, tell me this was at least
the best kiss of your entire life!

201
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,160
- It was pretty amazing.
- Aha! I'm so proud of you!

202
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,920
Otis! Can you help me out
with something for the thing?

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,320
Our computer guy has dropped out,
so we need a replacement.

204
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,480
I thought of you 'cause you seem nerdy.

205
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,720
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
- So, yeah.
- Okay.

207
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,200
Well, I was kinda hoping
to stay out of this one.

208
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Um, what?
Of course you'll help. I'll help too.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Thank you.
Hey, be more Eric, okay? Thank you.

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
I agree with that, actually.

211
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,240
What's the thing?

212
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,840
[mischievous music playing]

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,760
- Thought you were shutting down the stall.
- It's for the thing!

214
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
[Steve] They look great.

215
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,680
- Aimee, have you got a sec?
- Thought we weren't talking.

216
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
I've been an absolute arse.

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,520
Me too. Steve, hold the cakes.

218
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,920
[Aimee sighs]

219
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,560
[Maeve] I'm so sorry. You're right.

220
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm shit at asking for help,
and I push people away.

221
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,720
No. I should never have done
what I did without asking first.

222
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,960
I didn't realize how hurtful it would be.

223
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,616
Thing is, I need help now,
and you're the only person I can trust.

224
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,320
Okay. What we doing?

225
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,360
Can you drive me to Lockwood-on-Sea?

226
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,000
Right. Steve, you're in charge
of vulvas from now on.

227
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,000
If anyone asks, the wobbly bits
aren't mistakes because...

228
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
All vulvas are unique.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good lad.

230
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,120
They better not be squished.

231
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,720
[whimsical music playing]

232
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,520
He does these silly air punches
like he's Bruce Lee or something.

233
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,680
[laughs]

234
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,480
He bites his fork when he eats.

235
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
It's only been a few months.

236
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,640
I shouldn't be
so irritated by him, should I?

237
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,920
Are there any positives?

238
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,160
We have lots of sex.

239
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Ooh. [chuckles]

240
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Well, a healthy sex life is important
for many people.

241
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,320
I know it won't last though.

242
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,120
There was a time that Michael and I
couldn't keep our hands off each other.

243
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
And then

244
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,200
it just stopped.

245
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,480
Well, that doesn't have to be inevitable.

246
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,040
Oh, I've been meaning to tell you
that Michael stopped by the other day.

247
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,720
He was returning something that
belonged to me. We ended up having a chat.

248
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,640
About what?

249
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
I think he's struggling a bit
and just needed someone to talk to.

250
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,880
[scoffs]

251
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,760
That's a bit rich.

252
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,920
Sorry. [sighs]

253
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,600
It's just... Why wouldn't he talk
to me all those years?

254
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
And Adam's exactly the same. [sighs]

255
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,600
It's just so lonely sometimes
with all these men.

256
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,880
[Jean] Well, Adam will talk to you
when he's ready.

257
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,200
You know, I'm not very good
at letting Otis come to me.

258
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,200
I admire your restraint.

259
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,320
- Twenty minutes.
- Thank you.

260
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, that looks nice.

261
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,840
We are making way for a brighter,

262
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,880
cleaner future

263
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,200
here at Sparkside Academy.

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,640
You can fucking do this.

265
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
[woman] The press are arriving.

266
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,880
It's Superman pose.

267
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,120
It helps with nerves.
There's a TED Talk on it.

268
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,680
- [scoffs]
- [clears throat, sniffles]

269
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,920
[whimsical music continues]

270
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Right.

271
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,480
Making way for a brighter,

272
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,680
cleaner future

273
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,960
at Sparkside fucking Academy.

274
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Fuck.

275
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
Yes.

276
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,120
- Why are you wearing that?
- You told me to.

277
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,440
Okay, take it off now.

278
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Yeah.

279
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,640
- Hope! It's a good turnout.
- Yes!

280
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
Lots of prospective students,
the press, and all our private investors,

281
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,280
so, uh, no pressure at all. [chuckles]

282
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,440
Right. Well, I'll be interested
to hear your feedback.

283
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,160
Would you, um, just excuse me a second?

284
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
Mm. Yeah.

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cal?

286
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,160
Come with me.

287
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
[Cal] Get your hands off me!

288
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,120
You have been told repeatedly
to change your behavior,

289
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,720
but you are clearly innately disobedient.

290
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
[scoffs]

291
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,920
The press would be interested
to hear about

292
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,120
the way I've been discriminated against

293
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,720
due to how I present.

294
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm left with no choice but to keep you
in here for the remainder of Open Day.

295
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,400
- You're in violation of my rights.
- [door rattling]

296
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Let me go!

297
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,960
- [indistinct chattering]
- [camera shutters clicking]

298
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,520
Well, this... this is different.

299
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,480
[Colin] Oh.

300
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,960
[Jackson] So, yeah,
all pretty self-explanatory.

301
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,920
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,480
- Stop.
- Okay.

303
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,200
- Start.
- Okay.

304
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
- Dimmer.
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,840
- And do not press these red...
- This one?

306
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
- [Jackson] Yeah. Don't press that.
- Okay.

307
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,960
- I'll keep him...
- [Eric] Okay.

308
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,320
- [Jackson] Yeah?
- [Eric] Yeah.

309
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,760
I mean, I was imagining something
more center stage, but this is cool.

310
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,760
It's likewe're in <i>Ocean's Eleven,</i> innit?

311
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Maybe I'm George Clooney,
and you're Brad Pitt?

312
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,776
- No.
- I'm Brad Pitt. You're George Clooney.

313
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,920
- I'm Andy GarcÃ­a. If I'm anyone.
- Who's Andy GarcÃ­a?

314
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,920
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
while you boys hash that out.

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,960
- Yeah.
- I'll see you both on the other side.

316
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,520
- Thank you! Don't do that.
- Yeah! Yeah.

317
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,840
I think that
Jackson is Rihanna in <i>Ocean's Eight</i>

318
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,320
- Because of the bone structure and eyes.
- I've not seen it.

319
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,240
- No?
- No.

320
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,320
- Okay.
- But fine.

321
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,400
It was very good.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,200
- Ugh, this fucking fringe.
- Aimee, can you please look at the road?

323
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,600
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

324
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,440
Right, come on. You and Otis kissed
in France. What happened?

325
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,320
I don't know.

326
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,320
My head's all over the place
at the moment.

327
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,760
[breathes deeply]

328
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,880
- Things are over with Isaac as well.
- Hmm.

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,680
I feel bad about hurting his feelings.

330
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,280
I'm sorry, babes.

331
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,560
Does this mean you and Otis
might actually finally get together?

332
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
I don't know.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,281
We've changed a lot,
so I don't know if it would work out.

334
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,040
I think you should just
bloody go for it, love.

335
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,440
It's like Simone de Beauvoir says,

336
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,600
"From the hour you're born,
you begin to die."

337
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,040
I think it means "live for the day."

338
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,280
Yeah. Once I realized
she wasn't a lad called Simon,

339
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,280
her writing started
to make a lot more sense.

340
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,480
[chuckles]

341
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,600
[pop music playing over stereo]

342
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,240
I shouldn't have said
that stuff about you and Steve.

343
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,520
I didn't mean it.
I think you're great together.

344
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,560
No, you were right. It's not working out.

345
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,760
- I'm sorry.
- [car horn honking]

346
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,040
- Can you please look at the road?
- Sorry.

347
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,800
[exhales]

348
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,960
- I love you, love.
- I love you, love.

349
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,360
- [Aimee] My concentration's not great.
- It's all right.

350
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,200
I'm sure some of you probably had
your reservations about coming here today.

351
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,040
[chuckles] I don't think anybody wants
to send their child to a school

352
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,160
that's famous for STIs and sex musicals.

353
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,480
But I'm here to assure prospective parents

354
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,680
that these scandals are
a thing of the past.

355
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,480
And so it is my promise to you

356
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,040
that if you should choose
Sparkside Academy for your child,

357
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,120
that they will receive their education
on a safe

358
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,920
<i>and sex-free campus...</i>

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
Sex-free camp... People fuck in the bushes!

360
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,800
We will protect our youth at all costs.

361
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,640
Now, let's hear it from a shining example
of Sparkside's new ethos,

362
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,440
Vivienne Odusanya.

363
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,440
[cheering]

364
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,080
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

365
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Come on, Viv!

366
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,040
Thank you, Hope, for giving me
the opportunity to speak today.

367
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,800
Firstly, I'd like to invite
Jackson Marchetti onstage

368
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
to reclaim his position as head boy.

369
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,560
[audience clapping, cheering]

370
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,120
Whoo!

371
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Thank you, Viv.

372
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Ah.

373
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,600
It's good to be back.

374
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,840
We agree with Hope
that students should feel protected

375
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,280
whilst on campus.

376
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,880
The students of Moordale Secondary
would like to share some ideas

377
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
<i>on how we think</i>

378
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,600
listening to young people

379
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,480
could make our new campus
the safest place to study in the UK.

380
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
We hope you enjoy.

381
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,840
What the hell is going on?

382
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,720
[audience cheering]

383
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
[screen motor whirring]

384
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,000
- [Otis] It's a very slow screen.
- It is a slow screen.

385
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,840
[whirring stops]

386
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
And here we go.

387
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,920
[upbeat music playing]

388
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
[audience clapping, cheering]

389
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,200
<i>Hi! We're the students of Sex School.</i>

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
<i>You might recognize us from the press.</i>

391
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,560
<i>We're the deviant youths
having loads of S-E-X.</i>

392
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,520
<i>And catching chlamydia.</i>

393
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,400
<i>And writing musicals about dicks!</i>

394
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,976
[Jackson] <i>But I'm not embarrassed
to be a student of Sex School.</i>

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
<i>Sex, well, it's part of being human.</i>

396
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,680
[Vivienne] <i>Whoa!</i>

397
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,480
How did you let this happen?

398
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,280
- I'm going to stop the video.
- Do it quickly. Don't make a scene.

399
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,600
[Vivienne] <i>...bodies and identities.</i>

400
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,000
[Jackson] <i>Which is why
schools need safe spaces</i>

401
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
<i>for people to ask those things
that some might find a little awkward,</i>

402
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,240
<i>where there's no shame, stigma, or fear.</i>

403
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,360
[Vivienne] <i>Because when shame
is used as a weapon,</i>

404
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,680
<i>it doesn't just hurt people.</i>

405
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,400
<i>It can damage them forever.</i>

406
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
<i>But the opposite of shame is pride.</i>

407
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,040
<i>And the students of Sex School are proud
of the things people like to shame us for.</i>

408
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,240
[Vivienne] <i>Because if Lily Iglehart
is a weirdo</i>

409
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,960
<i>for writing short stories
about aliens with penis hands,</i>

410
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,040
<i>we're definitely weirdos too.</i>

411
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,360
[audience laughter, applause]

412
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,560
[Aimee] <i>I love my clitoris,
and I feel no shame.</i>

413
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,720
<i>Ladies, get your wank on!</i>

414
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,320
[audience laughter, whistling]

415
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
[mischievous music playing]

416
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,360
<i>I bind my chest, and I feel no shame!</i>

417
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,320
<i>- I have a hairy bum, and I feel no shame.</i>
- [audience laughing]

418
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
[Ruby] <i>I am literally perfect...</i>

419
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,240
Stop the video now!

420
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,600
[Anwar] <i>I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.</i>

421
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,720
<i>- I'm great...</i>
- That's not gonna do anything.

422
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
There's nothing to see here.

423
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,760
- Get out of my way!
- Eric!

424
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,080
<i>I'm great at anal douching.
I'm great at anal douching.</i>

425
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,720
<i>I'm great at anal douching.</i>

426
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,920
[audience groaning]

427
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
[Ruby] Drop the plug.

428
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,800
- [Eric] What?
- [Otis] Ruby?

429
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,320
- I said, drop it! Ah!
- [grunts]

430
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
- [Otis] Ruby. Miss!
- [Eric] Miss!

431
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,120
[grunts]

432
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,680
- Oh my... Is that?
- That's a burn.

433
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,240
Ow! What are you doing?

434
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,320
[Eric] Yes, yes.

435
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,680
Oh my God! Wow!

436
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,800
Ruby!

437
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
[video continues playing]

438
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,080
<i>I'm great at anal douching,
and I feel no shame.</i>

439
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Right.

440
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,240
- [Eric] Ru... Ruby!
- [Ruby exclaiming]

441
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,680
[Eric] You cannot do that!
You mustn't do that!

442
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,840
[audience groans]

443
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,560
[screaming]

444
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,840
- [Otis] Ow!
- [Eric] Oh God! Jeez!

445
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,840
[Hope groans]

446
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,960
[video continues playing]

447
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,440
<i>I'm great at anal douching...</i>

448
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
That is very expensive perfume.

449
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,520
- You're incredible!
- I know.

450
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,440
[Connor] <i>I'm attracted to boys and girls,
and I'm trying not to feel shame.</i>

451
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,440
What have you done? [sighs]

452
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,320
[girl] <i>I have a third nipple,
and I have no shame.</i>

453
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,120
- [Otis sighs]
- Now, was that Fleurs du Mal?

454
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,320
[girls moaning]

455
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,720
- [girl 2] Come on! Come on!
- [Cal] What the fuck?

456
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,600
- Oh, this school...
- [girl 2 moaning]

457
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,640
<i>A lot of shame comes from
old-fashioned views on sex.</i>

458
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>Sadly, schools have taught a lot of people</i>

459
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,640
<i>to feel ashamed
of their identities and bodies.</i>

460
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,360
<i>The cycle continues today.</i>

461
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,920
[Jackson] <i>But the world is changing,
and young people have had enough.</i>

462
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,520
<i>So if you agree that communication
and empathy are better tools</i>

463
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,240
<i>than silence and shame,</i>

464
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,160
<i>then join us
by asking your school for better.</i>

465
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,480
[audience applause, cheering]

466
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,760
[audience chanting] We are Sex School!

467
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,880
- We are Sex School!Â We are Sex School!

We are Sex School!Â We are Sex School!

475
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,960
Thank you!Â Thank you all for listening.

476
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,600
And now the choir will sing us out
with our beautiful new school anthem.

512
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,160
[audience screaming, cheering]

513
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,920
<i>âª Yeah âª</i>

514
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,240
<i>âª Fuck the pain away âª</i>

515
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,280
<i>âª Fuck the pain away âª</i>

516
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,120
<i>âª Suck, suck, suck
Sucking on my titties âª</i>

517
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,680
<i>âª Fuck the pain away âª</i>

<i>âª Sucking on my titties âª</i>

523
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,960
- [cheering continues]
- [Colin] Yeah! You know it!

524
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,480
Those are my kids!

525
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
You're my kids!

526
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,280
Come on, Moordale!

527
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,120
[cheering echoing]

528
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,040
[woman] What's wrong
with schools teaching abstinence?

529
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,480
Well, schools that teach abstinence

530
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:24,080
actually have a higher rate
of teen pregnancies and STIs

531
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,960
than schools
with comprehensive SRE programs.

532
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,560
And when we give teens

533
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,680
<i>agency, information, and trust,</i>

534
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,560
<i>there's a much higher success rate...</i>

535
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
<i>Sorry, Dr. Milburn, apologies.</i>

536
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,800
<i>It appears there's a situation developing
as we speak at Moordale Secondary.</i>

537
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,520
Let's go live there now
to our reporter on the ground.

538
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,440
[female reporter]
<i>What was meant to be the day</i>

539
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:48,000
<i>that Moordale Secondary squashed
the title of "Sex School"</i>

540
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
has evolved
into something quite the opposite.

541
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,880
<i>Students have taken to protest,</i>

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,160
<i>doubling down
on their belief in sex positivity,</i>

543
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,600
<i>and saying that
new head teacher Hope Haddon</i>

544
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>is quite simply behind the times.</i>

545
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
<i>But as you can see...</i>

546
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,040
Otis?

547
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
<i>- ...from the "Wall of Vulva" behind me...</i>
- Oh.

548
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,640
<i>- ...the question remains...</i>
- Ooh.Ow.

549
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,320
<i>...how progressive is too progressive?</i>

550
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
[groans]

551
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,880
These people will know. I can sense it.

552
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,840
[Maeve] Okay.

553
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,720
Hi! Have you seen a woman
with blonde hair and green eyes?

554
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,600
Kinda looks like her, only older.

555
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,480
- Oh. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

556
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
[phone ringing]

557
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,240
Maybe this was a stupid idea.

558
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,160
She used to bring us here
as kids all the time,

559
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,280
usually when she was feeling guilty
about something.

560
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,640
At least you've tried.

561
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,880
[Erin laughing]

562
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,040
[indistinct chattering]

563
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,920
[whimsical music playing]

564
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,960
[Maeve] Hi, Mum. Hi, Elsie!

565
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,360
- [Erin] What you doing here?
- Should ask you the same.

566
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,880
- Mummy's taking me on a boat.
- Fuck!

567
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,120
Come on!

568
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,520
- [Eric] This is amazing.
- [Otis] Mm.

569
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,240
You know this started with you, right?

570
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,760
- What do you mean?
- You and Maeve.

571
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,776
The clinic thing. Getting everyone
to talk about their problems.

572
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,120
If it wasn't for that, I don't think
vaginas would be getting drawn on a wall.

573
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
Vulvas.

574
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,360
You like helping people.

575
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,520
It's one of the reasons
I love you so much.

576
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,080
I know you've been hurt, but I don't think
you should lose this part of yourself.

577
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,920
It's a very good part.

578
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,600
- Thanks, man.
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
- I've gotta go, actually.
- Where?

580
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,000
Oh my God! That clitoris is gorgeous!

581
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,680
- Shall we get out of here?
- Yeah.

582
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,880
- Mm-mm-mm.
- There he is.

Uh... [clears throat] Hello?

[Peter] <i>Michaela!
I've invited Maureen for tonight.</i>

595
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,640
<i>Hope that's all right.
You're not technically divorced, right?</i>

596
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,000
No. No, that's fine.

597
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,520
Is the new boyfriend coming?

598
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,960
<i>Ha! Hope not.
That would be really awkward for you. Ha!</i>

599
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,080
<i>- Anyway, gotta go. See you later, bye!</i>
- Bye.

- [Cal] Yeah.

- Oh, I'm proud of you too.

- What?

605

Oh, I'll see you guys tomorrow.

606
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,720
- [Jackson] Yeah, see you later.
- [Cal] See you, Viv.

607

- [both] Hey.
- [both chuckle]

608
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,320
So, you wanna hang out?

609
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,440
Yeah.

610
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,160
Okey dokey, let's be having you.
All aboard the Skylark!

611
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,400
I'm not due for eight weeks. [groans]

612
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,880
- That's it, darling.
- [sighs]

613
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,320
You're the lady
who used to do therapy at the school?

614
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,760
Yeah, that's me.

615
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,320
My daughter's at Moordale.
She's going through a bit of a tough time.

616
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Quite worried about her, to be honest.

617
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,680
I wish she had someone professional,
like you, she could talk to on campus.

618
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,360
Sorry. That's the last thing
you want to be thinking about.

619
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,896
Oh, no, it's good to be thinking
about something else. [groans]

620
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,720
Why's she having a tough time?

621
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,120
Keep breathing.
Um, well, she's refusing to go to school.

622
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,760
She's always been a bit of an outsider.

623
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,040
She's obsessed with aliens
and things like that.

624
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,880
I don't think people really get her.

625
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,400
I don't think I understand her sometimes.

626
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,600
Well, I'm sure
you're more alike than you think. [groans]

627
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,360
Maybe try and find some common ground,
something you can relate to in her world,

628
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,320
and see if the conversation starts there.

629
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,640
Ooh, oh shit!

630
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,080
Okay, blow out the candles
with me, darling.

631
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,440
- [short, quick breathing]
- I'll try Jakob again.

632
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,360
[Jakob] It's funny.

633
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,120
She's the one that wanted this meeting,
but she's the one that's late.

634
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,280
[chuckles]

635
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,080
You mean, you wouldn't choose
to be here if it weren't for Jean?

636
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,680
No. [chuckles]

637
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,600
Well,

638
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:35,840
perhaps we can use this time to talk
specifically about your feelings, Jakob.

639
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
[breathes deeply]

640
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
I feel fine.

641
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,560
You don't seem fine. You seem angry.

642
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Well, she's late.

643
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,080
Can I ask you
about your previous marriage?

644
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
[splutters]

645
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,640
She... she passed away.

646
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,200
Yes, but I wonder,

647
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,960
can you tell me a little bit
about the relationship before she died?

648
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,360
We met young.

649
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,480
[sighs]

650
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,000
I loved her very much.

651
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320
And I think she loved me.

652
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,280
But it was young love.

653
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,960
Um, we were both very naive. And...

654
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,480
then things changed
once we had our children.

655
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
How did it change?

656
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,920
[exhales]

657
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,120
She met someone else.

658
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,960
I think she...

659
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,960
she wanted to leave me.

660
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,040
[emotional music playing]

661
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,520
Then she got sick.

662
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,600
It was all very confusing.

663
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Yes, I can imagine it must have been.

664
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,120
But you stayed with her.

665
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
Yeah. You don't leave
when someone is sick.

666
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,440
And we made it work...

667
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,760
[sighs]...until the end.

668
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
When did you grieve?

669
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,920
When she died,

670
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,680
I...

671
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,720
broke down into pieces.

672
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,560
Yes, but when did you grieve
for what you lost

673
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,200
when your wife had the affair?

674
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,640
It must be very hard
to trust anyone properly again.

675
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,480
Especially when you weren't able
to fully process the feelings that you had

676
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,040
about your wife's betrayal.

677
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,000
Yeah, I have a problem with trust.

678
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,760
But I want to try.

679
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,680
[emotional music continues]

680
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
[romantic music playing in background]

681
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,160
Mm-mm.

682
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Too fast?

683
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,920
- Yeah, I'd rather keep it off.
- That's cool.

684
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
I mean on. [chuckles]

685
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,440
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

686
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,600
You really are so beautiful.

687
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,360
Oh shit, that's a gendered word.

688
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,680
Pretend I didn't say that.

689
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,080
I'd also still be into you
if you weren't beautiful...

690
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,856
Not that I don't find you beautiful.
I do think men can be beautiful.

691
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,480
- Like a beautiful soul. Know what I mean?
- Jackson. [chuckles]

692
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,400
Don't worry about it. [chuckles]

693
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,280
- Okay.
- Mm.

694
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,240
I really didn't mean what I said.

695
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,400
I'm sorry.

696
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,000
No, it's... it's fine. It's okay.

697
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
Okay.

698
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,760
I just feel like I fucked up.

699
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,800
Should we just stop?

700
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
[chuckles]

701
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,400
Um, yeah. I mean, you seem tense,
and now I'm tense too.

702
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,320
Yeah.

703
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,080
- We can try again another time.
- Yeah.

704
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
Yeah.

705
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,200
[chuckles]

706
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,600
[exhales]

707
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,520
If this was going to become more serious,

708
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,720
then you would be in a queer relationship.

709
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
Is that okay with you?

710
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Yeah.

711
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,520
Yeah, I haven't, like,
got a problem with that...

712
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,640
Hm.

713
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
...at all.

714
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
[Cal chuckles]

715
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,480
Um...

716
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,880
[breathes deeply]

717
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
- I have to go.
- What?

718
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,160
Just... I just gotta help my mum out
with some stuff.

719
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,400
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Okay.

721
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,560
But I'm... Yeah, okay.

722
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

723
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,200
[scoffs] What the fuck?

724
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,800

726
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Ugh!

727
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,640
You don't wanna do this, Mum.
That's why you called me.

728
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,520
Don't tell me what I wanna do.

729
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Who is that girl who keeps staring at us?
She's freaking me out.

730
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,000
It's my best friend, Aimee.
She gave me a ride here.

731
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,320
- And what? Is she undercover, is she?
- No.

732
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,440
Thanks very much.

733
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,680
How am I supposed to know?
You're good at calling the police on me.

734
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,040
- You have any idea how that fucked me up?
- You've been fucked up about it?

735
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,120
- Try having your kid taken off you!
- Mum, I'm 17!

736
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,640
- I should never have had to report you!
- I know I wasn't there for you, okay?

737
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,080
But it's different with Elsie.
I'm gonna give her a better life.

738
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
Mum, you can't stay clean.

739
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,080
It doesn't make you a bad person.

740
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,416
It's just Elsie needs someone
in her life who isn't using.

741
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
What, like Anna?

742
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,360
Can we go and see Anna?

743
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,960
Come on, Els, let's go.

744
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,960
Did you get onto that thing
for smart kids in America?

745
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,520
- How'd you know about that?
- That boy Isaac told me about it.

746
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,400
Yeah, I did, but I can't afford it.

747
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,640
[Elsie] Mummy, I want to see Anna.

748
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,160
Do you think Anna loves her?

749
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,680
Yeah, I do.

750
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,760
Hey. You're gonna stay with Maeve.

751
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,680
- I wanna stay with you, Mummy.
- It's not very nice where I'm going.

752
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,240
It rains all the time,
and there's no chips!

753
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
I love you.

754
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
Oh, I love you too, darling.

755
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,120
[voice breaking] You go back to Anna's
with Maeve, and I'll visit.

756
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,480
- [Erin sobs] Okay?
- Okay.

757
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,600
Oh, I'm a lucky mummy.
Bye-bye, darling. Bye-bye.

758
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,600
[sobs] Please just take her
before I change my mind.

759
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,320
Elsie, come here. Come give me a hug.

760
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,600
[Erin crying]

761
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,000
[Elsie] Bye, Mummy.

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,720
Hey, Lily. It's Otis.

766
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Can I come in?

767
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,520
We missed you today.

768
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,240
And the school realized
what Hope did to you guys was wrong.

769
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,120
We all got together to fight
for what we wanted Moordale to be like.

770
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,160
It was kind of amazing.

771
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,880
[emotional music playing]

772
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,560
It also made me kind of sad

773
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,880
'cause, uh...

774
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,720
I've realized
I've shut myself off recently.

775
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,600
I stopped believing
it was my place to try and help anyone.

776
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,960
I got hurt last term.

777
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
Badly.

778
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,920
And I didn't wanna do the clinic anymore.

779
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,680
But that doesn't mean

780
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
I shouldn't try and be a good friend.

781
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,920
I saw you

782
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,000
after Hope humiliated you.

783
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,600
I didn't even ask if you were all right.

784
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,480
I should've checked in.

785
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
I'm...

786
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm really sorry I didn't.

787
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
Ooh! [exhales]

788
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,680
Why are you on the floor?

789
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,800
Do you want some alien stuff?
I'm throwing it away.

790
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I'm okay.

791
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,560
Thanks.

792
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Ola said you guys aren't speaking.

793
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,240
We're kind of fighting.

794
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,960
I think she's going through
a tough time too.

795
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,360
She's really missing her mum.

796
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,560
Maybe I've been a bit distracted,
but I'm not ready to talk to her yet.

797
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,680
I didn't think we were friends.

798
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,160
Well, I... I know we don't hang out much,

799
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,480
but I think we like each other.

800
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,320
Meh, you're all right.

801
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,760
I know what you mean about shutting off.

802
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,440
I do that, too,

803
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,320
when I'm hurt
or I feel like I don't fit in.

804
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,640
What do you do when you shut off?

805
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,880
Hm.

806
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,320
Think about my stories.

807
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,720
About alien planets and galaxies.

808
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,960
I used to do it all the time
when I was a kid, but...

809
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,000
I guess it's just weird
now that I'm getting older.

810
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,240
It's really common

811
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,920
for people to create
rich fantasy worlds to escape into.

812
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's what most artists do.

813
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,080
They are brave enough
to show the weirdest,

814
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,480
most vulnerable sides
of themselves in their work.

815
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,480
Which helps a lot of people
not feel as alone.

816
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Thanks, Otis.

817
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,360
But I don't think I'm an artist.

818
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,080
I wouldn't be so sure.

819
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,680
And even if you do decide
to not write about aliens anymore,

820
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,320
you shouldn't ever give someone
the power to humiliate you.

821
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,400
You're great.

822
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,400
Just the way you are.

- It's probably dumb.
- Adam!

838

It's so great you've entered at all.
Your mum will be so proud.

839

Hm. Well, I've not invited my mum.

840
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,440
So you only invited me?

841
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,840
Yeah. You're the only one I want there.

842
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,480

843
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,160
that maybe we could try
going out together.

844
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,400
Maybe somewhere a bit more gay?

[clicks tongue]

846
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,280

[laughs] Yeah.

848
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,800
Or like, um, a club or something.

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,920
[Adam] Mm.

850
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,440
We could get dressed up. Could be fun.

Mm. Uh...

852
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,080
I don't think that would be my thing.

00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,720
- You like it when I put makeup on you.
- Yeah, when we're in my room.

854
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,120
I don't know if I'm ready to do that with...

855
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,360
in front of people.

856
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,200
I like it when it's just you and me.

857
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,880
[chuckles]

858
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,280
[pensive music playing]

859
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:23,640
I have to tell you something.

860
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,240
I kissed someone else.

861
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,320
[emotional music playing]

862
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,080
In Nigeria.

863
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,880
You what?

864
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,240
[exhales]

865
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,280
It just happened. I'm so sorry, Adam.

866
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,320
I need to go and feed Madam, so...

867
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,680
[sniffles, groans]

868
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,880
Madam? [clears throat]

869
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,000
[Jean grunts in labor]

870
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,680
- [grunts]
- [Lily's mother] Amazing!

871
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,600
You're nearly there, Jean.

872
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,880
Where the fuck isÂ Jakob?

873
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,600
Keep breathing, Jean.
You're doing amazingly.

874
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,840
- [grunting]
- Amazing!

875
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,440
[Lily's mother] That's it. That's it.

876
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,520
- [door opens]
- [grunts]

877
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,616
- [Jean breathing heavily]
- [Lily's mother] Brilliant.

878
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,120
Why are there so many people?

879
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,280
When babies are a little early,
they always like to have us all here.

880
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,600
[Peter] I said,
"I'm injured in three places,"

881
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,800
and the doctor says,
"Well, don't go there."

882
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,880
[laughing]

883
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:53,920
[phone chimes]

884
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,240
Ah, bummer!

885
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,040
- Maureen says she can't make it.
- Aw.

886
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,000
This salad's delicious.
Did you make it, Peter?

887
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,360
[laughing]

888
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,560
No, I don't have the time,
unfortunately, to cook.

889
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,920
That's why God gave us caterers!

890
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
[laughter]

891
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,720
[woman] Very good.

892
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,000
I made that one, actually.

893
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,720
[woman 2] Oh. Where'd you get the recipe?

894
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,200
- I saw it on a television program.
- Mm.

895
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,080
But I added the feta and the parsley.

896
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,280
I love a man who can cook.

897
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,840
[Peter] I don't think making a salad
is exactly cooking, is it?

898
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,240
Putting a lot of leaves in a bowl.

899
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:31,080
But wait till you taste the chocolate
and beetroot cake for dessert.

900
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,920
It's to fucking die for and gluten-free.

901
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,720
- Guilt-free. Huh?
- Mm. There is something sweet in there.

902
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,840
I put honey in the dressing,
and there's also pomegranate seeds and...

903
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,960
Pomegran... [laughing]

904
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,560
Could somebody here give
my little brother a job?

905
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,280
- He's got too much time on his hands.
- [woman 3 laughs]

906
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,920
[silverware clattering]

907
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,040
What you doing?

908
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:58,920
I'm leaving.

909
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:02,360
Why? The grown-ups
are in the middle of dinner.

910
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,080
Because I can't bear to waste
another precious second of my life

911
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,280
pretending to like you.

912
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,000
You're awful.

913
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,680
Oh, that's a wee bit dramatic,
don't you think, Michaela?

914
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,840
My name is Michael!

915
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,440
And my life is a failure.

916
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,640
My wife's left, I'm quite sure
my son hates me, and I'm unemployed.

917
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,560
But I'd rather all those things than be
a pumped-up shit of a man like you.

918
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,800
You've been a shit since you were a child.
I think you'll be a shit until you die.

919
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,320
Probably because our dad
was the biggest shit of all.

920
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,440
And you learned to bully me
so he wouldn't bully you.

921
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,440
[sighs]

922
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,960
And that is such a great shame.

923
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,040
But I am too old
for it to be my problem anymore.

924
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,240
Goodbye, Peter.

925
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,040
He, uh... He's...

926
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,880
IÂ like this bowl.

927
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
[upbeat music playing]

928

[sighs]

929
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,800
Hi. I got your messages. Where is she?

930
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,920
She's in there.

931
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,160
[grunting]

932
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,640
[Lily's mother] That's it, darling.

933
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,840
I need you to give me
one last big push, Jean.

934
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,680
- [groans, grunts]
- [Jakob] Come on. Come on. Come on.

00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,440
That's it. You've done it!

938
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,560
- It's a little girl!
- [Jean groans]

939
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,080
I'm so sorry I was late.

940
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,600
It's a girl.

941
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,800
- You did it! You did it!
- [baby crying]

942
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,280
She's so tiny.

943
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,600
So tiny.

944
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,600
- You did so good.
- [breathes deeply]

945
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,440
- I feel strange.
- What?

946
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,240
Something's wrong.

947
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,920
What? Something's wrong.

948

What's happening here? What's happening?

950
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,040
Can you please step outside?

951

[tense music playing]

952
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,720
Thank you so much, Maeve.

953
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:50,960
Come here.

954
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,040
Will you stay again tonight?

955
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:57,600
You've had a really shitty day.

956
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,120
Yeah, that would be nice.
I'm just gonna say goodbye to my friend.

957
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,200
Okay.

958
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,800
Maeve, I know
you don't like emotional shit,

959
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,280
but I've been thinking about
how you don't really have a proper mum,

960
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:18,480
and I wanted you to know
that even though my mum has money,

961
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
she's also crap sometimes too.

962
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,760
So I was thinking
that maybe we could be each other's mums.

963
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,440
[emotional music playing]

964
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,440
Thanks, Mum.

965

You're welcome, Mum.

[knocking at door]

- Hi, Maureen.
- Hi.

968
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,080
I made a salad.
I thought you and Adam might like it.

969
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,800
Actually, that's not true.
I just wanted to see you.

970
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,760
And I just wanted to say

971
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,760
that I know I was hard to live with,

972
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,800
that I'm rigid, and I'm uptight.

973
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,560
I don't know how to be spontaneous
or anything close to happy.

974
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,680
But I do want to change.

975
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,480
I want to try to be the man that you want.

976
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,240
Do you think we could talk?

977
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,600
I don't want to talk.

978

Hi! What are you doing here?

995
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,640
I, uh, I needed to talk to you.

996
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,360
What's... what's going on?

997
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,400
It was never about the clinic.

998
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,960
I did the clinic to be close to you.

999
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,640
And then you made me realize
I'm good at something,

1000
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,640
and I like helping people.

1001
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,240
And I thought you ignored my message,
and it crushed my heart.

1002
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,760
I stopped doing the clinic
because it reminded me of you. It sucked.

1003

'Cause I wanna help people.

I know this is only about money for you,
but let's just be a team again, please?

00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,960
<i>âª And take my pick âª</i>

1024
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,360
<i>âª I view my fate âª</i>

1025
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,280
<i>âª And make the choice âª</i>

1026
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,360
<i>âª 'Cause it's nobody else's but mine âª</i>

1027
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,800
<i>âª But you're in my heart âª</i>

1028
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,280
<i>âª I can feel your beat âª</i>

1029
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,720
<i>âª And you move my mind âª</i>

1030
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,200
<i>âª From behind the wheel âª</i>

1031
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,640
<i>âª When I lose control âª</i>

1032
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:43,840
<i>âª I can only breathe your name âª</i>

1033
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:48,400
<i>âª 'Cause you're in my heart âª</i>

1034
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,880
<i>âª I can feel your beat âª</i>

1035
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,320
<i>âª And you move my mind âª</i>

1036
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,800
<i>âª From behind the wheel âª</i>

1037
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,240
<i>âª When I lose control âª</i>

1038
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,080

1039

<i>âª I can only breathe your name âª</i>

1040
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:13,840
