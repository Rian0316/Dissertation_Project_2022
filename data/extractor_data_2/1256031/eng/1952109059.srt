1
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,290
Problem?

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,290
- This is Thai food. - Here we go.

3
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,110
We don't have Thai food on thursday.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,490
We have pizza on thursday.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,050
Yes, but we all agreed that the third thursday

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,530
At every month would be anything can happen thursday.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,960
Well, apparently that you didn't reach my digestive system

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,890
which when startle has its own version

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,410
On anything can happen thursday.

10
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,060
Come on, the whole idea hehind anything can happen thursday

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,340
Is to get out this rut we've been in lately.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,040
Rut? i think you mean consistency.

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,550
And if we're going to abandon that,

14
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,990
Then why even call it thursday?

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,620
Let's call it quorncle day,

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,570
And celebrate it by sacrificing a goat

17
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,780
To the mighty god rut.

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,900
I can go for some goat.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,690
Seldon, we agreed we do something different tonight.

20
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,950
All right.

21
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's go to the comic book store.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,530
We went to the comic book store last night.

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,910
Last night was Wednesday

24
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,100
Wednesday is comic book night

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,450
Tonight we will be going on Thursday

26
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,470
?
Because it is Anything Can Happen Thursday

27
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,620
Rather then get outside,

28
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,940
But praise right up against the box, Sheldon.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,320
So what are we gonna do tonight?

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,340
If I may profer a suggestion

31
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,060
in bars, all across this great nation

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,950
Our Thursday night is Ladies' Night

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,390
Which means as the evening progresses we will get better looking

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,160
99 cent margaritas

35
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,960
and two-for-one jello shot

36
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,300
Come on Howard,

37
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,290
The odds of us picking up girls at bar is practically zero

38
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,740
ok, Really, are you familiar the Drake equation

39
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,140
The one that estimates the odds making

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,600
contact with the extraterrestrials

41
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,740
By calculating the product of increasing

42
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,440
restricted  series of fractional value

43
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,790
such as external planet

44
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,300
and the planet likely to develop life

45
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,900
N=R*Fp*Ne*Fl*Fi*Fc*L

46
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,790
Yeah, That one.

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,930
you can modify it to calculate our chance of having sex

48
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,670
by changing the formula to use the number of single women in LA

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,990
and the number of those i find attractive

50
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:23,180
by what i call the wolowitz coefficient

51
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,780
The wolowitz coefficient?

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,800
needing us times stress size square

53
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,290
counting the numbers i come

54
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,730
you're joking.

55
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,990
i am a horny engineer leonard.

56
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,750
i never joke about math or sex.

57
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:48,960
what are we waiting for? lets bounce bitches.

58
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,930
oh, you're right.

59
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,850
it's anything can happen thursday

60
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,420
let's hit the club and meet hot women.

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,360
here we go, lock up your daughter.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,690
we're going to hit them and quit them.

63
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,720
or we can finish eating and then go to the comic book store.

64
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,030
also a good plan.

65
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,000
all right. but next anything can happen on thursday.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,110
we ll definitely go into a bar

67
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,380
Absolutely.

68
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:19,820
You heard that ladies night, ladies we are eventually coming for you.

69
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,610
Fascinating.

70
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,480
Oh Hey Guys, Where are you heading?

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,660
To the comic bookstore.

72
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,060
You are probably thinking the comic bookstore on a Thursday

73
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,260
Why falling down the rabbit hole and into a land of magnet.

74
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,240
If you've failed to take into account Penny

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,660
This is anything-can-happen-Thursday

76
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,040
You got me.

77
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,830
Oh hey, while you are there could you pick me up a few comics

78
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,620
for my nephew's birthday?

79
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,950
No, I think you mean comic books

80
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,330
comics are feeble attempts humor featuring

81
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,680
talking babies and anthropomorphized pets

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,310
found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.

83
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,630
Leonard can you pick me up a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

84
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,760
Sure what does he like?

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
13?
I don't know. he is thirteen, just pick out anything.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,320
Just pick out anything?

87
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,080
May be the same time we can pick out a new suit for him

88
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,680
without knowing his size.

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
or pick out his career form

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,440
without knowing his aptitude.

91
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
or pick out his breakfast cereal

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,700
without knowing his fiber requirements

93
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,200
Or his feelings about little marshmallows.

94
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,830
Spider-man. get him spider-man.

95
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,640
Amazing spider-man, ultimate spider-man, spectacular spider-man,

96
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,100
The marvelous adventures of spider-man, spider-man 2099?

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Leonard?

98
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,960
You know this can go on all night.

99
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,230
Why don't you just come with us?

100
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,330
That's what I was trying to avoid.

101
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
Oh, I forgot sensational spider-man.

102
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,260
Aw, what a cute, little store.

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,800
Ev-everybody's staring at me.

104
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,800
Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them.

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,130
Unlikely.

106
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,000
Here, what about this one for my nephew?

107
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,500
- A superb choice. - oh, great.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,590
Provided he has already read infinite crisis and 52,

109
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,400
And is familiar with the reestablishment of the dc multiverse.

110
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,460
What's a "multiverse"?

111
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,530
Get her out of here.

112
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,360
Come on, I'll help you pick something.

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,730
That's right. she's with us.

114
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,530
Guys like that are so pathetic.

115
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,960
Tell me about it.

116
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,730
Ooh, look, a new batman belt buckle.

117
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,130
Oh, hey, leonard.

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
Can I help you find something?

119
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,930
Oh, hey, Stuart. this is penny.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,600
She's just looking for some comic books.

121
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,900
Oh, really, wow.

122
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,130
Blink twice if you're here against your will.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,100
I think we're fine, stuart.

124
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,430
Okay. well, let me know if you need anything.

125
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,800
Thanks.

126
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,960
Oh, he seems like a nice guy.

127
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,060
You mean for someone who's into comic books?

128
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,430
No. no-no-no.

129
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,130
I just meant for... yeah.

130
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,440
Penny,

131
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
Just because people appreciate comic books doesn't make them weirdos.

132
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,760
Stuart's a terrific artist.

133
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,930
He went to the rhode island school of design.

134
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,950
What about the guy over there in the

135
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,200
Superhero t-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,130
Uh, yeah, that's captain sweatpants.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He doesn't really help the point I'm trying to make.

138
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:10,200
- Got it. - got it.

139
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,630
- Need it! - Need it!

140
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,200
Let it go, sheldon.

141
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,000
Why should I let go? I saw it first.

142
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,960
Yes, but I saw it from the front.

143
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,530
A far less impressive feat.

144
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,630
Oh, come on!

145
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,330
I need this for my batman collection.

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,030
Well, I need it for my robin collection.

147
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
Rock-paper-scissors- lizard-spock?

148
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,800
Why would I gamble?

149
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
It's mine. let go.

150
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,160
- You let go. - no, you!

151
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,830
- No, you! - problem?

152
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,130
Yes. he won't let go of my comic book.

153
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
It's my comic book!

154
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,630
Leonard, we need a ruling.

155
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,330
Cut it in half?

156
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,160
Excuse me.

157
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,300
Oh, hello again.

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,730
Hi. what would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

159
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,400
A 13-year-old girl.

160
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,560
But if you're dead set on a comic book, try... this.

161
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,860
Oh, hellblazer.

162
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,000
What's this about?

163
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,960
A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes,

164
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,100
Has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.

165
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,300
Well, if that doesn't make me the favorite aunt,

166
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,700
I don't know what will.

167
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,560
Is this me?

168
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,900
Depends. do you like it?

169
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,000
Wow, it's really good.

170
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,500
Yes, that's you.

171
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,960
That's so sweet, but what if I didn't like it?

172
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,230
It'd still be you, but I'd feel like an idiot.

173
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,560
I don't believe it.

174
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,030
Stuart's putting the moves on penny.

175
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,900
I have got to learn how to draw.

176
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,360
Hey! once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.

177
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,800
Guys, have you seen stuart all up in penny's business over there?

178
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,030
Nobody's up in anybody's business.

179
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,930
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

180
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay, you've got my number.

181
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,530
Now, give me the picture.

182
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,300
You drive a hard bargain.

183
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,430
But here.

184
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,600
All right. so, um, just give me a call.

185
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,260
So, leonard, how are you enjoying anything can happen thursday?

186
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,730
Look at that.

187
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
That's a dent.

188
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Thank you, howard "ham-fisted" wolowitz.

189
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,110
Did you just shut the tv off in the middle of the classic

190
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,160
The original series "trouble with tribbles" crossover episode?

191
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,600
Apparently so.

192
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,460
Are you ill?

193
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:36,800
- No. - all right.

194
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,710
Then is it fair to say that you're experiencing some sort of

195
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,130
Emotional turmoil over the events involving penny earlier this evening?

196
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
When did you pick up on that?

197
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:46,740
A moment ago,

198
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,950
When you turned off the tv in the middle of the classic

199
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:53,630
The original series "trouble with tribbles" crossover episode.

200
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,500
Would you like some advice?

201
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,630
Sure, why not?

202
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,450
Well then,This is the perfect time to launch a

203
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,100
Blog with an interactive comments section?

204
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,630
Gee, thanks a lot.

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,860
Would you rather I offer my personal insight?

206
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't need any insights.

207
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,360
I just want to know why penny's more interested in stuart than me.

208
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,130
We're practically the same guy.

209
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,430
Oh, I disagree.

210
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,190
Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly,

211
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,860
He gets 45 percent off comic books.

212
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,200
You're right.

213
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,430
I really should be asking strangers on the internet.

214
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:41,360
My original point.

215
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,330
Chinese food, vintage video games...

216
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,560
After the nightmare of anything can happen thursday,

217
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,660
This is friday night the way it was meant to be.

218
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,460
Who's up for sheldon-free saturday?

219
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,100
Oh, hey, guys.

220
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, penny... and stuart.

221
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,130
Hey, stuart.

222
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,430
Hey, guys.

223
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,930
So what are you kids up to?

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,700
Stuart has a piece in an art show that's opening tonight.

225
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,130
And you guys are going together. great...

226
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,300
It is great.

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,630
Really great.

228
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,460
Freaking awesome.

229
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,100
What are you guys doing?

230
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,010
It's friday night-- that means chinese food and vintage video games,

231
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,360
Right?

232
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,730
Vintage doesn't even begin to describe what we have planned.

233
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,160
1980ZORK
Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, zork.

234
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,530
It's the buggy beta version.

235
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,530
Wow, zork.

236
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,730
Well, you guys have fun.

237
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
Yeah. see you guys.

238
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,860
See you, stuart.

239
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,100
- Hey, howard? - yes?

240
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,400
Take me to a bar with women.

241
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,300
- Really? - yeah.

242
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,930
Okay!

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,460
Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.

244
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,830
Why?

245
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,960
Well, if I get lucky, I don't want to be caught in my aquaman briefs.

246
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?

247
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,300
- No, he may not. - why?

248
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,280
I'm not sitting here with a guy

249
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,200
Drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.

250
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,900
Fine.

251
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
I'll have a chocolate martini.

252
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,500
Wrong again!

253
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:31,930
Come on,

254
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,970
You know I can't talk to women unless

255
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,500
I'm lit up like the hindu festival of dewali.

256
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,360
Look, There are plenty of bars in los angeles

257
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,160
where you can order grasshoppers and Chocolate martinis,

258
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,960
but you wouldn't have to because there are no women in them.

259
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,130
gotcha.

260
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,030
I'll have a brandy alexander.

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,300
All right, the three musketeers just became the dynamic duo.

262
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,000
Should we talk to some of these women?

263
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,160
No. it's way too early in the night for that.

264
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,330
See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then...

265
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,130
We go after the weak and the old and the lame.

266
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,660
That's your system?

267
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,230
That's my system.

268
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,230
Oh, and if you spot a chick with a seeing eye dog, she's mine.

269
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,620
Oh, come on.

270
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,830
I think it's nice that captain sweatpants showed up to your art opening.

271
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,960
Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese.

272
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,600
You know, it's kind of early.

273
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,700
Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?

274
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,060
Oh, gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it?

275
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, you think "coffee," means coffee.

276
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,630
That is so sweet.

277
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,760
Come on. I think I have decaf.

278
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,530
Oh, good. stuart.

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,900
I thought I heard your voice.

280
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,530
Do you have a moment?

281
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,700
Uh, yeah, I guess.

282
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,200
Sheldon, we're a little busy here, so...

283
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,130
What are you doing?

284
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,330
We're having coffee.

285
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,630
Well, isn't it a little late for coffee?

286
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,630
It's okay. she thinks she has decaf.

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,830
I'll just go look for it.

288
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,260
What's up?

289
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,100
Well,  I've spent the last three hours in an online debate

290
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,930
In the dc comics batman chatroom, and I need your help.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,300
Oh, yeah. those guys can be very stubborn.

292
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,460
What's the topic?

293
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,990
I am asserting, in the event that batman's death proves permanent,

294
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,740
The original robin, dick grayson,

295
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,100
Is the logical successor to the bat cowl.

296
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,660
Ooh. sheldon, I'm afraid you couldn't be more wrong.

297
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,800
More wrong?

298
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,060
Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.

299
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,460
Of course it is.

300
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,660
It's a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable.

301
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,330
It's very wrong to say it's a suspension bridge.

302
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,410
But returning to the original issue, dick grayson became nightwing,

303
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,300
A superhero in his own right.

304
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,160
Batman 2 has to be the second robin, jason todd.

305
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,630
Has to be? has to be?

306
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,700
I hope you're being deliberately provocative.

307
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,230
I found the decaf!

308
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,360
Oh, great!

309
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,760
Herbal tea for me, please.

310
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,030
Barkeep!

311
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,870
Alexander me.

312
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,770
How about those two?

313
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,170
No...

314
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,670
They're eating peanuts.

315
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,870
And my allergies, one kiss would put me in cedars-sinai for a week.

316
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,300
What about the ones in the corner?

317
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,670
Possible. very possible.

318
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,640
Do you want the one in the whiplash collar

319
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
or the one who keeps blinking?

320
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,070
I think blinky's cute.

321
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,840
You got it, sir.

322
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,570
Wait, so we just go over there?

323
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,740
No.

324
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,700
We have a little prep work to do.

325
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,640
Put this in your mouth.

326
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,170
We walk past them, you stumble a bit.

327
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,470
I say, sorry, my friend's had a little too much.

328
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,300
And then I start to pull it out of your mouth.

329
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,370
And say, "a little too much fun."

330
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,200
Get it?

331
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,200
I mean, they're laughing. we're laughing.

332
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,210
Then we get them up to about a .

333
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,700
and tell them we're millionaires.

334
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,440
What else you got?

335
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:17,770
Depends.

336
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:20,700
Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?

337
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,570
No.

338
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,600
I can't sit on your lap. you don't know the routine.

339
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,070
DC
I'm sorry, but you're obviously stuck in a pre-zero hour dc universe.

340
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,400
Of course I am.

341
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,610
Removing joe chill as the killer of batman's

342
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,300
Parents effectively deprived him of his raison d'etre.

343
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,590
Okay.

344
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,700
You can throw all the french around you want, it doesn't make you right.

345
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,100
Au contraire.

346
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,420
Plus,

347
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,090
You're forgetting that the infinite crisis

348
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,540
Storyline restored joe chill to the batman mythology.

349
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,070
I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.

350
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,570
Okay.

351
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,470
Look, sheldon, it's late. I've got to get some sleep.

352
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,600
So, I win.

353
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,900
No, I'm tired.

354
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,040
So, I win.

355
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,470
Fine. you win.

356
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,070
Darn tootin', I win.

357
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,770
Penny, I really had a terrific time...

358
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,940
Penny?

359
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,570
No, no, no, no, no. don't wake her.

360
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,900
She'll maul you like a rabid wolverine.

361
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,900
You know, I don't think that was decaf.

362
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,300
Wait. is this your card or isn't it?

363
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,940
Trust me. this was their card.

364
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,770
I thought you were good at this.

365
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,040
You're always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.

366
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,000
I do, all the time.

367
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,900
Well, what happened?

368
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,080
We've been sitting here all night and the longest

369
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,900
Conversation you've had with a woman was when your mom called.

370
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,540
Wow. you're just going to make me come out and say it, aren't you?

371
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,140
Say what?

372
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,670
You're weighing me down.

373
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,140
I'm a falcon who hunts better solo.

374
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,140
Fine. I'll sit here. you take flight and hunt.

375
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,570
Don't be ridiculous.

376
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,870
You can't just tell a falcon when to hunt.

377
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,770
Actually, you can.

378
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,700
There's whole sport built around it.

379
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Falconry.

380
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,340
Shut up.

381
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,370
Let's just get koothrappali and go.

382
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,370
Lucky bastard.

383
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,700
It's got to be that stupid accent of his.

384
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,700
Hello. I am sanjay wolowitz from bombay.
