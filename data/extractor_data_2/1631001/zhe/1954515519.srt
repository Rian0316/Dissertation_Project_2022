He was obviously a kid when it happened.

You know,I'm glad Robin got it right.

And this thing right here does not have a proper filter.

I made a mistake letting you go, didn't I?

Yep, I finished downstairs and the outside.

Now, I could keep looking and see what else I can find

besides the black mold, the damaged retaining wall,

这也倒还好 只是和整个台面板不太搭调

Or I could just recommend that you do not buy this godforsaken
我的建议是你们千万别买这栋 比拘留所还不如的房子
