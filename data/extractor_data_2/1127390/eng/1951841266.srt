1
00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:01,279
Ok...

2
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,875
The X10's are online

3
00:00:05,262 --> 00:00:11,220
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal 
from this laptop through our local ISP

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,373
racing down fibre optic cable at 
the speed of light to San Fransisco,

5
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:18,546
bouncing off a satellite in 
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal,

6
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,486
where the data packets will be headed off 
to submerge transatlantic cables,

7
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,292
terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia

8
00:00:23,384 --> 00:00:26,697
and transfered across the continent 
via microwave relays back to our ISP

9
00:00:26,817 --> 00:00:30,024
And the extend receiver attached to this...  

10
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:31,869
Lamp.

11
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,895
Look at me, look at me. I've got juice bumps.

12
00:00:37,015 --> 00:00:39,800
- Are we ready for the stereo?
- Go for stereo.

13
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,061
- Hey guys.
- Hello.

14
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,766
It's a little loud.

15
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:07,795
No problem...
Turning it down.

16
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,295
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax...
...et voilà!

17
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:17,281
- OK, thanks.
- Hang on, hang on. Do you not 
realise what we just did?

18
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:19,670
Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop.

19
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:24,560
No, we turned our stereo down, by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

20
00:01:25,884 --> 00:01:28,266
Oh. You know you can get one of those
universal remotes from Radioshack?

21
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:29,747
They're really cheap.

22
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:32,773
No, you don't get it.
Howard,

23
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:36,031
- Enable public access.
- Public access enabled.

24
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:43,075
- Boy, that's terrific. I'll see ya.
- No hang on, hang on...

25
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:46,460
See?

26
00:01:48,093 --> 00:01:48,732
No.

27
00:01:49,614 --> 00:01:53,430
Someone in Sichuan province,
China, is using his computer

28
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,062
to turn our lights on and off.

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,040
Oh, that's handy.

30
00:01:59,408 --> 00:02:01,393
Here's a question...
Why?

31
00:02:03,092 --> 00:02:04,966
Because we can.

32
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,651
They found our remote control cars!

33
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,474
- Wait, what's on top of that?
- Wireless webcams, wave hello!

34
00:02:15,445 --> 00:02:18,202
The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas,

35
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,891
and the blue Viper is being operated
 from suburban Tel Aviv.

36
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:27,070
- You may want to put on slacks.
- What?

37
00:02:29,805 --> 00:02:32,982
Ew, stop it! No!
Leave me alone!

38
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:39,158
- Who's running the red Corvette?
- That would be me.

39
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,359


40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,760
The Big Bang Theory - Season 1 - Episode 9

41
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:54,661


42
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:59,262


43
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:01,963


44
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,697
You know in the future, 
when we're disembodied brains in jars,

45
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:08,521
we're going to look at this as eight hours well wasted.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,727
I don't want to be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

47
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,837
Eight feet tall and ribbed.

48
00:03:18,138 --> 00:03:19,241
I'm with you. 

49
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:22,771
I just have to make sure if I'm 
a synthetic human I'd still be Jewish.

50
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,014
I promised my mother.

51
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:31,815
I suppose you could have 
your android penis circumcised.

52
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:37,075
But that's something your rabbi 
would have to discuss with the manufacturer.

53
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,373
Not to mention you'd have to 
power down on saturdays.

54
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,721
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

55
00:03:44,841 --> 00:03:46,418
Well, there's always the possibility that

56
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,419
a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter

57
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,881
but Occam's rasor would suggest 
that someone threw it out.

58
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:57,072
It's from the Institute of 
Experimental Physics, they want us to 

59
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,324
present our paper on the properties of supersolids

60
00:03:59,353 --> 00:04:02,313
at the topical conference of Bose-Einstein condensates.

61
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,572
I know.
I read it before I threw it out.

62
00:04:06,271 --> 00:04:08,499
Ok, if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question:

63
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,911
why did you throw it out?

64
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:13,793
Because I have no interest in standing in 
the Rose room of the Pasadena Marriot,

65
00:04:13,913 --> 00:04:16,087
in front of a group of judgmental strangers

66
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,550
who wouldn't recognise true genius if 
it was standing in front of them giving a speech.

67
00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:22,175
Which if I were there, would be.

68
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,626
I don't know Sheldon.

69
00:04:24,627 --> 00:04:28,001
Those topical conferences on 
Bose-Einstein condensates' parties are legendary

70
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,258
- Forget the parties!
- Forget the parties? What a nerd.

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,935
Are there any other honours I've got that I don't know about?

72
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,869
Did the UPS dropped off a 
Nobel prize with my name on it?

73
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,133
Leonard, please don't take this the wrong way,
 but the day you win a Nobel prize,

74
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:47,333
is the day I begin my research on the drag coefficient of tassles on flying carpets.

75
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,187
the only thing missing from that insult was: "your mama".

76
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:54,966
I got one...
Hey Leonard,

77
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,390
- Your mama's research methodology is so flawed...
- Shut up, Howard.

78
00:04:59,683 --> 00:05:02,012
- Sheldon, we have to do this.
- No, we don't.

79
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:04,410
We have to take a nourishment, to expel waste,

80
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,069
and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cells from dying.

81
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:08,576
Everything else is optional.

82
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:11,649
Ok, let me put it this way: 
I'm doing it.

83
00:05:11,731 --> 00:05:13,979
You can't. I'm the lead author.

84
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,829
Come on, the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically.

85
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:20,379
I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you

86
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,801
the humiliation with dealing with the fact that it was my idea.

87
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:25,928
Now to put too fine a point to it, but I was throwing you a bone.

88
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:27,805
You're welcome.

89
00:05:28,326 --> 00:05:31,779
Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis.

90
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:33,656
That doesn't mean proving.

91
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:37,329
So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?

92
00:05:37,384 --> 00:05:39,343
They're not supposed to, but they should.

93
00:05:40,426 --> 00:05:42,056
Alright, I don't care what you say.

94
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:44,427
I'm going to the conference and
 I'm presenting our findings

95
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:46,359
And I forbid it.

96
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,346
You forbid it?

97
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:50,977
If I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is.

98
00:05:51,032 --> 00:05:53,266
- So, you admit that it's our work.
- No.

99
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:55,403
Once again, I'm throwing
you a bone.

100
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,925
And once again, you are welcome.

101
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,104


102
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:10,120
So, how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking to each other?

103
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,888
Not only is he still not talking to me,


104
00:06:11,943 --> 00:06:15,259
but there's this thing he does where he stares
at you and  tries to get your brain to explode.

105
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:20,727
You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie "Scanners"?

106
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:22,946
Like.... Bzzz.

107
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:25,975
Nevermind.

108
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:27,674
How about this one?

109
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,716
It says, I know my physics, but I'm still a fun guy.

110
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:35,526
Oh, I didn't know they still made corduroy suits.

111
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:37,814
They don't, that's why I saved this one.

112
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,788
Ok, well, let's just see what else you have.

113
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,049
Ok, here. Take this.

114
00:06:44,214 --> 00:06:48,105
and this, and this,
and this, and these...

115
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,887
Is this all stuff you want me to try on?

116
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,723
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

117
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:56,489
Seriously, don't even give it to charity, 
you won't be helping anyone.

118
00:06:57,341 --> 00:06:58,890
What's this?

119
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:01,713
That's the bottled city of Kandor.

120
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:08,592
You see, Kandor was the 
capital city of the planet Krypton.

121
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:11,418
It was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded

122
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:13,315
and then rescued by Superman.

123
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,498
Oh, nice.

124
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:20,390
It's a lot cooler when girls aren't looking at it.

125
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:24,556
Here, why don't you put these while I find
a shirt and a sport cut match.

126
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,597
Right, be right back.

127
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,379
Where are you going? Just put them on.

128
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,393
Here?

129
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,201
Oh, are you shy?

130
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,874
- No, I'm not shy.
- Don't worry I won't look.

131
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,723
I know you won't look.
Why would you look?

132
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,245
There's nothing to see...
Well, not 'nothing'...

133
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:38,738
Sweetie, put the pants on.

134
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:43,192
So, you know, isn't there maybe
some way you and Sheldon could

135
00:07:43,233 --> 00:07:46,673
- compromise on this whole presentation thing?
- No, No.

136
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,495
Scientists do not compromise.

137
00:07:48,523 --> 00:07:50,612
Our minds are trained to synthetize facts 

138
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,537
and come to inarguable conclusions.

139
00:07:52,798 --> 00:07:55,703
Not to mention, Sheldon is back-crap crazy.

140
00:07:58,814 --> 00:08:00,389
What is this?

141
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:02,486
Oh, careful.

142
00:08:02,938 --> 00:08:06,438
That's my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

143
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:09,132
Oh, why didn't you wear it on Halloween?

144
00:08:09,502 --> 00:08:11,503
Because it's not a costume, it's a flight suit.

145
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:16,915
Ok, alright, moving on.

146
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,245
Oh, wow. A paisley shirt.

147
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:21,958
It goes with my corduroy suit.

148
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,206
if you mean it should end up in
 the same place, then I agree.

149
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:28,755
Is this your only tie?

150
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:32,674
Technically, yes. But, if you'll notice...

151
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,374
It's reversible!

152
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,224
So it works as two.

153
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,198
Sweetie, I don't even think it works as one.

154
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:45,666
- Is this all your clothes?
- Eh, yeah.

155
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,583
Everything since the eighth grade.

156
00:08:47,706 --> 00:08:50,529
- The eighth grade?
- My last growth sprout

157
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:55,723
Ok, well, let's go back to the curdoroy suit.

158
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:57,710
- Great.
- Yeah.

159
00:08:59,381 --> 00:09:01,228
I said no. Put it down.

160
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:09,165
Hey Sheldon.

161
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,686
Hello Penny.

162
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,112
Get anything good?

163
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:19,210
Just the latest copy of
 Applied Particle Physics quarterly.

164
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,526
Oh, you know, that is so weird 
that yours came and mine didn't.

165
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,885
It was a joke.

166
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,037
Yep.

167
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,696
Tip you waitresses.
I'm here all week.

168
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,847
Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness,

169
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:45,369
know that I'm perfectly comfortable with
 the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

170
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:48,151
Oh, yeah ok, me too. Zip it, lock it.

171
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,084
Put it in your pocket.

172
00:09:56,482 --> 00:09:58,990
- So, you and Leonard...
- Oh dear God...

173
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,291
Little misunderstanding, huh?

174
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,140
A little misunderstanding...?

175
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,505
Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.

176
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,994
Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning
 and I think he feels really bad about it.

177
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,713
How do you feel?

178
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:20,529
I don't understand the question.

179
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:25,287
I'm just asking if it's difficult 
to be fighting with your best friend.

180
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,597
I haven't thought about it like that.

181
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:31,767
I wonder if I've been experiencing physiological manifestations 

182
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:34,430
of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil

183
00:10:35,826 --> 00:10:36,855
Wait, what?

184
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,818
I couldn't poop this morning.

185
00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:46,279
You should just talk to him, 
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

186
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,436
- Certainly preferable to my plan.
- Which was?

187
00:10:49,826 --> 00:10:51,246
A powerful laxative.

188
00:10:53,465 --> 00:10:55,627
You absolutely should talk to him.

189
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,218
Look, I know Leonard values you 
as a friend and he told me himself

190
00:10:58,426 --> 00:11:01,898
without your little idea there's no way
 he could come up with this whole experiment thing.

191
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,949
Excuse me. "Little idea"?

192
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:09,961
Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me,

193
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,740
- I didn't really understand it but...
- Of course you didn't.

194
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,410
He said: "Little idea"?

195
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,664
Oh, well, no...
Not...

196
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:19,174
- Not in those words.
- In what words then, exactly?

197
00:11:19,632 --> 00:11:22,593
Oh, you know... Gee. The exact words are...
It's more the spirit in which he said...

198
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:25,134
- What did he say?
- You had a lucky hunch

199
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:29,131
Hey, Sheldon, I've been thinking, instead of arguing about this...

200
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:31,228
Don't you ever speak to me again.

201
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,811
What...?

202
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:50,020
Ok, I'm leaving for the conference.

203
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:52,720
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch"

204
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,554
Shel, I didn't mean it like that.

205
00:11:54,674 --> 00:11:56,340
- Then why did you say it?
- I don't know, I wasn't...

206
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,209
- Were you trying to impress Penny?
- No, no, not at all. A little bit.

207
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:03,256
How did that work out for you?

208
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:07,064
- Leonard, ready to go?
- Libido: 1 Truth: 0.

209
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:11,197
Ok, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

210
00:12:11,317 --> 00:12:13,847
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

211
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,779
And I'm telling you for the last time, 

212
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,729
it's pandering, it's undignifying, and bite me.

213
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:22,123
Let's go.

214
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:24,243
- Bye Sheldon.
- Goodbye Penny.

215
00:12:35,462 --> 00:12:37,021
One of these days... bshh!

216
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:41,587
There you go.

217
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,372
You're right this side does look better.

218
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,395
No, no, I didn't say better, I said "less stained".

219
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,384
I just checked the house. 
There's probably 20-25 people in there.

220
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,000
- You're kidding!
- Is that all?

221
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:56,529
"All?"
In particle physics 25 is Woodstock!

222
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,909
- Then good!
- I wasn't expecting such a crowd,

223
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:03,031
I'm all nervous.

224
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,327
It's ok, just open with a joke,
you'll be fine.

225
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:07,546
A joke... Ok.

226
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,459
How about this? Um, ok...

227
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:12,025
There's this farmer

228
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:16,076
and he has these chickens but they won't lay any eggs, so...

229
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:18,197
he calls a physicist to help.

230
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:21,140
The physicist then does some calculations,

231
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:24,730
and he says: "I have a solution,

232
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:29,308
but it only works for spherical chickens in a vacuum".

233
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:32,874
Right?

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,809
Oh, sorry, I just had heard it before.

235
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:43,562
- Let's roll. Hey, nice suit.
- It's a classic, right?

236
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,447
I really should have brought my own car.

237
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,651
So, in conclusion,

238
00:13:51,771 --> 00:13:54,551
the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero,

239
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:58,170
the moment of inertia changes, and a solid becomes a supersolid,

240
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,311
which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.

241
00:14:05,213 --> 00:14:06,303
Thank you!

242
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:13,516
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

243
00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:15,510
What the hell was that?

244
00:14:18,151 --> 00:14:19,241
Any other questions?

245
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:24,397
Doctor Sheldon Cooper here, I am 
the lead author of this particular paper.

246
00:14:26,085 --> 00:14:27,120
Thank you.

247
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:33,525
And you sir, you have completely skipped
over the part where I was walking through the park

248
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:36,915
and I saw these children on a
merry-go-round which started me thinking

249
00:14:37,035 --> 00:14:39,832
about the moment of inertia in gases like helium

250
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:41,890
at temperatures approaching absolute zero.

251
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,812
I didn't skip it. It's just
an anecdote, it's not science.

252
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,926
Oh, I see. It was
the apple falling on Newton's head,

253
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:50,614
- was that just an anecdote?
- You are not Isaac Newton.

254
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:54,051
No, no, that's true. Gravity
would have been apparent to me without the apple.

255
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:56,541
You cannot possibly be that arrogant.

256
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:59,020
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

257
00:14:59,615 --> 00:15:03,489
Look, if you weren't happy with my presentation
then maybe you should have given it with me!

258
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,535
As I have explained repeatedly,
unlike you,

259
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,998
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

260
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:08,846
No offense.

261
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,618
Really, so why did you come?

262
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:12,074
Because I knew you'd screw this up.

263
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:13,429
I didn't screw it up!

264
00:15:13,442 --> 00:15:15,857
Oh, please. I admit that spherical 
chicken joke, 

265
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,868
- that was hilarious.
- Thank you.

266
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,806
But it was straight downhill from there.

267
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,104
I've had enough of your condescendship.

268
00:15:21,204 --> 00:15:24,175
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11 like you.

269
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:27,673
Maybe I got my doctorate at 
24 instead of 16

270
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,400
but you are not the only person
who is smarter than

271
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,807
everyone else in this room!

272
00:15:32,187 --> 00:15:32,797
No offense.

273
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,626
And I am clearly not the only person

274
00:15:36,651 --> 00:15:38,417
who is tormented by insecurity 

275
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:40,544
and has an ego in need of constant validation!

276
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:42,284
So you admit you're an egotist?

277
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:43,295
Yes!

278
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:47,689
My name is doctor Leonard Hofstadter
and I can never please my parents so

279
00:15:47,695 --> 00:15:50,068
I need all my self esteem 
from strangers like you!

280
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,169
But he's worse!

281
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,078
Ok, that's it!

282
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,022
Stop it!

283
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:59,323
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind!

284
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:01,256
Then I'll settle for your aneurism!

285
00:16:01,818 --> 00:16:03,442
- Stop it!
- You hit me!

286
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:04,697
You saw that he hit me!

287
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,325
You tried to blow up my head!

288
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:07,262
So it was working!

289
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:09,648
It wa... It was not!
You're a nutcase!

290
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:10,624
We'll see about that!

291
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,117
Heads up, you people in the front row!

292
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:13,353
This is a splash zone!

293
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:15,164
Stop it!

294
00:16:15,651 --> 00:16:16,139
Just quit it!

295
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,540
Is this usually how these physics things go?

296
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,226
More often than you think.

297
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:31,684


298
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:44,626
You could have offered me a ride home.

299
00:16:46,558 --> 00:16:48,298
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

300
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,287
I really don't understand what you're so unhappy about.

301
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,950
You begged me to come, I came.

302
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,153
There's just no pleasing you.

303
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:57,712
You're right, I'm the problem, 
I'm the one that needs help.

304
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:00,389
Well, that's not much of
an apology but I'll take it.

305
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:02,787
Excuse me,

306
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,599
is there anything you would apologise for?

307
00:17:07,197 --> 00:17:07,813
Yes.

308
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,110
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

309
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,184
It was uncalled for.

310
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:16,604
You won't believe this.

311
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,085
Somebody got the whole thing with their 
cell phone and put it on YouTube!

312
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,272
What?

313
00:17:22,965 --> 00:17:25,213
- Who would do that?
- That would be me.

314
00:17:27,009 --> 00:17:28,711
Hey, check it out,
 it's a featured video!

315
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:30,739
<i>He hit me!
You saw that he hit me!</i>

316
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,792
[i]You tried to blow up my head![/i]

317

- It was not working! You're a nutcase!</i>

318
00:17:34,828 --> 00:17:35,843

319
00:17:35,894 --> 00:17:37,175

heads up!</i>

320
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,459
<i>This is splash zone</i>

321
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,644
<i>Stop it! Leave it,
leave it!</i>

322
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:47,680
<i>You want a volcano nerve pinch!</i>

323
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:51,768
<i>You should clip your fingernails!
Those hurt!</i>

324
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:56,457
Oh, Jeez. does this suit really look that bad?

325
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,443
Forget your suit,
look at my arms waving.

326
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,074
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

327
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:04,886
Howard,

328
00:18:05,114 --> 00:18:07,543
would you like to explain to me 
why your Facebook page 

329
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,832
has a picture of me sleeping
on your shoulder

330
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,293
captioned "me and my girlfriend"?

331
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:15,661
Uh oh, here comes
the talk.

332
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:26,455
- You hit me!
- You tried to blow up my head!

333
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:29,494
- So it was working!
- It was not working! You're a nutcase!

334
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:30,476
We will see about that!

335
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:32,037


336
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:35,867


337
00:18:38,972 --> 00:18:41,515


338
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,966


339
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:49,817


340
00:18:50,934 --> 00:18:54,022


341
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,523
