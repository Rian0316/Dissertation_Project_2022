bigger hard drive in the TiVo,

I'm simplifying the task
of packing for our trip.

给衣服贴上电子标签

to read and identify
the items with this wand.

this fairly pointless conversation.

store seems a little redundant now.
看来作弄苹果店里的人都多余

Whatever it is, I'm guessing
we're doing it wrong.

Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics

of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

this train 90 seconds,

and you've already
said a thousand words.

Here.
这儿

I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the
steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails,
我希望你在享受车轮
和铁轨发出的美妙喀嚓声时

84
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,820
your sour disposition will abate.

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,200
Meanwhil back in the 21st century,
people are raising their tray tables
同时21世纪的人
在准备收起折叠桌

将座椅调整到竖直状态

其实也没那么糟啦

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,890
At least these trains
have modern plumbing.

90
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,590
In India, you squat over a hole in the
train and expose your naked buttocks

蹲在车厢里的一个洞上

91
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,230
to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
感受拉贾斯坦邦的冷空气

Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express
他说的当然是印度
华丽的Ranakpur特快三等席

and its 1,200-kilometer journey from
Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
从马哈拉施特拉邦到比卡内尔接轨点
的1200公里旅途

94
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,280

on an international scale.

Is that who I think it is?

It can't be. What would Summer
Glau be doing riding the train?
不能够啊 Summer Glau干嘛坐火车

98
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,620
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.
可能John Connor也在车上
她要保护他不被坏终结者追杀

99
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,320

Thank you.
多谢提醒

101
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,650
Of course, if SkyNet actually
did exist in the future,
当然啦 如果"天网"真的存在于未来世界

102
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:07,120
a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy
mankind would be to send Terminators back posing
那么完美潜入毁灭人类的方法就是
让派来的终结者

103
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,640
as actors who have played Terminators
in popular films and television series,
扮成曾在热门电影剧集中
饰演过终结者的演员

104
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,270
lulling us into a false
sense of security, i.e.,
让我们产生安全错觉 就像是

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,680
"That's Summer Glau "from
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
"她是<终结者 莎拉传>里的Summer Glau"

No, Summer, don't kill
me!" I'm pro-robot! Ahh!"

At least he's off the train crap.
至少他不再纠结那些火车的废话了

108
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,800
Whee!
嘻嘻!

109
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,810
Sheldon, I owe you an apology.
Sheldon 我得向你道歉

110
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,690
Taking the train was
a stroke of brilliance!
乘火车绝对是次天才的举动!

111
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,880
I've actually got a
shot at a Terminator.
终于有机会接触终结者了

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,890
Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators,
拜托 谈到终结者

113
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,300
you've got a better shot of
scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
我看你还是和施瓦辛格机会比较大

114
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,280
You're overlooking something.
你忽略了件事

115
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,740
I have 11 hours with
her in a confined space.
我将和她在这个狭窄的空间里
待上11个小时

116
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,550
Unless she's willing to jump off a moving
train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
除非她愿意跳下行驶的火车
翻转着滚下那边的山坡

117
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,930
she will eventually succumb to the
acquired taste that is ward Wolowitz.
她最终将屈服于逐渐产生好感的对象
那就是我 Howard Wolowitz

118
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,950
My money's on tuck and roll.
我压她滚下山

119
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,940
I'm confused.
我搞不懂了

120
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,130
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
我以为你和Leslie Winkle在社交上
保持着某种亲密关系

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,590
- Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.
- Sheldon 我来给你解释下
- 好吧

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,010
- That's Summer Glau.
- Yes.
- 那是Summer Glau耶!
- 是啊

123
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,870
That's it.
就这理由

124
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,170
Hang on a sec. Why do you
get first crack at her?
等等 凭什么是你第一个去追她?

125
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,890
Um, well, let's see, couple
reasons. One, I saw her first.
呃 我想想 几个理由
第一 我先看到她的

126
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,860
No, you didn't. I did.
不 不是你 是我

127
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,780
Fair enough. But... then,
let me move on to #2.
那好吧 但是...我们说第二个理由吧

128
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,420
Unlike you, I can actually
talk to women when I'm sober.
和你不同 我能镇静地同一位女性交谈

129
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,900
You fail to take into account that
even mute, I am foreign and exotic,
你没有考虑到 即使不说话
我来自国外 有异国情调

130
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,510
while you, on the other
hand, are frail and pasty.
相反 而你呢 虚弱而苍白

131
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,070
Well, you know the old saying,
Pasty and frail never fail.
