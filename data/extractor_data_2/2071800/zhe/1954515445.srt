老爸老妈浪漫史
第七季  第五集

10
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,800
<i>孩子们  在2011年10月</i>
<i>Kids, in October 2011,</i>

11
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,330
<i>你们的罗宾阿姨接受了心理治疗</i>
<i>your Aunt Robin was in therapy.</i>

12
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,030
进展一反常态地顺利
And against all logic, it was actually going well.

13
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,660
可这是为什么
But why?

14
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,960
为什么我总找理由让自己不幸福
Why-why am I constantly looking for reasons not to be happy?

15
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,060
也许是因为幸福圆满的大结局
Maybe because the idea of finally being happy...

16
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:16,730
反而让你畏惧
terrifies you.

17
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,130
哥们  你这话真是经典
Bro, you are killing it today.

18
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,460
确实很有疗效
We got something good here.

19
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,980
我绝对可以克服害怕被抛弃的心理了
We are totes gonna conquer my fear of abandonment!

20
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,010
我不能再见你了
I can't see you anymore.

21
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,030
说得好
Nice.

22
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,990
"不会吧  你要抛弃我了"
"Oh, no! You're abandoning me!"

23
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,980
不会吧  你真要抛弃我了
Oh, no. You're abandoning me

24
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,990
对不起  我要搬到阿拉斯加去了
I'm sorry. I'm moving to Alaska.

25
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,060
<i>故事原本到这儿就结束了</i>
<i>And that might have been the end of it.</i>

26
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,610
<i>但一周后...</i>
<i>But a week later...</i>

27
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,010
凯文
Kevin?!

28
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,390
你在这儿干嘛
What are you doing here?

29
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,120
其实  搬到阿拉斯加是骗你的
Okay, look, I lied to you about moving to Alaska.

30
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,450
我必须得回避你
I-I had to stop seeing you.

31
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,940
为什么
Why?

32
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,860
因为我觉得你很有爱
'Cause I think you're cute.

33
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,940
职业规定  如果我对你有感觉
And ethically, I can't be your therapist

34
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,430
就不能当你的心理医生了
if I'm attracted to you.

35
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,310
我懂了  你抛弃我这个病人
Oh, I get it. You dump me as a patient

36
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,270
是为了好跟我约会
just so you can ask me out?

37
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,260
我不会跟你约会的
I'm not gonna ask you out.

38
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,440
你不会吗
You're not?

39
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,510
不行  我们是在治疗期间认识的
No. We met in therapy.

40
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,000
跟病人约会对我而言不合适
It's inappropriate for me to date a patient.

41
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,080
总之  很高兴见到你
Anyway, it was nice seeing you.

42
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,880
等等
Hey, wait.

43
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,620
怎样才算"约会"
How do you define "Date"?

44
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,590
两个人一起吃饭
Two people having a meal together,

45
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,980
坐在一张餐桌的两端
sitting across the table

46
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,330
对彼此眉来眼去
making googly eyes at each other...

47
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,490
那如果是两个人单独吃饭  肩并肩坐着
What about two people eating alone, sitting side by side,

48
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,020
对着咖啡机眉来眼去呢
making googly eyes at the coffee maker?

49
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,040
可以  那就不是约会
Okay, it's not a date.

50
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,870
没错  不是约会
Exactly. Not a date.

51
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,680
<i>于是罗宾和凯文  在那周的每天早上</i>
<i>And so Robin and Kevin had breakfast alone,</i>

52
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,770
<i>都肩并肩坐着  各自吃早餐</i>
<i>side by side every day that week.</i>

53
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,630
<i>直到后来...</i>
<i>Until finally...</i>

54
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,370
抱歉  拦不到出租车
Sorry. No cabs.

55
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,230
我狂奔了40个街区过来的
Ran 40 blocks all the way here.

56
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,260
可能路上还撞到了一位老太太
May have knocked an old lady into the street,

57
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,210
我也不清楚  我没空回头看
don't know, I didn't look back.

58
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,700
我们来场真正的约会吧
Let's just go on a real date.

59
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,360
好  这个主意不错
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

60
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
湿材终于点燃爱火
Finally!

61
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,240
我迫不及待要去看那部电影了
Oh, I can't wait to see that movie.

62
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,170
-好看吗  -酷毙了
- Is it good? - Awesome.

63
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,190
等等  打个比方
Wait, totally hypothetically,

64
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,140
你会喜欢那种颠覆性结局
do you like movies with a shocking twist

65
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,100
最后主角全都死光光的电影吗
where all the main characters die at the end?

66
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,250
-喜欢  -那你会爱死这部电影的
- Yes. - You will love this movie.

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,590
-嗨  大伙  -嗨  马修  怎么了
- Hey, guys.- Hey, Marshall.What's up?

68
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,640
我告诉你们怎么了
Well, I'll tell you what's up.

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,740
你们都知道  我的老板加里森・库兹
You know how my boss, Garrison Cootes,

70
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,560
那个全世界最著名的环境律师吧
is,like, the most famous environmental lawyer in the world?

71
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,910
是...吧
Yeah...

72
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,500
我是说  除了他可能还有别人
I mean, it's him or the other guy.

73
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,730
-安东尼・霍威尔先生吗  --是...吧
- Sir Anthony Howel? - Yeah...

74
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,690
反正他也是个大人物  好吗
Anyway, he's an important guy, okay?

75
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,770
所以今天上班的时候
And so today at work,

76
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,850
我试图在他面前表现强硬
I was trying to show him that I'm tough.

77
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,040
我最近都在琢磨格鲁伯药业公司
I've been thinking about this settlement offer

78
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,100
开给我们的和解报价会有多少
we're about to get from Gruber Pharmaceuticals.

79
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,560
如果少于两千万
If it's anything less than $20 million,

80
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,710
我会揪住这些公司的地球强奸犯...
then I'm gonna grab those corporate Earth rapists by their...

81
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,640
好了  我要打断一下
Okay, I'm just gonna say something.

82
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,760
我现在肚子里怀着孩子
I'm growing a child in my belly,

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,120
孩子刚刚长出耳朵
a child that just developed ears.

84
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,660
这是件很薄的毛衣
This is a very thin sweater.

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,960
所以如果你非要说这事
So please, if you must tell your story...

86
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
麻烦注意用词
just make it cheerful.

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,020
注意用词
Cheerful.

88
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,110
马修原文猜测如下

89
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,510
好吧  那我会揪住这些公司的...
Okay...Then I'm gonna grab those corporate...

90
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,710
我要揪住那些地球强奸犯
I'm gonna grab those corporate Earth rapists

91
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,710
员工们
employees...

92
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,630
抓住他们出汗摇摆的...
by their sweaty, dangling...

93
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,020
双手
hands...

94
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,020
把潮了吧唧吊在裤裆里的蛋蛋
by their sweaty, dangling Balls.

95
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,270
用力挤压  直到这些贪婪的...
and squeeze until those greedy sons of...

96
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,210
父母养的
parents...

97
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,210
用力蹂躏  直到那帮贪婪的孙子
and squeeze until those greedy sons of bitches

98
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,810
意识到我是这世上最勇猛的...
realize that I'm the baddest mother...

99
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,910
热爱自然的小愤青
nature lover around.

100
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,910
意识到我才是地球上最坏的混蛋
realize that I'm the baddest mother fucker.

101
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,510
这就像是在看TBS台的《早餐俱乐部》
It's like watching The Breakfast Club on TBS.

102
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,510
美国电视频道TBS  会把脏话消音掉或剪辑掉

103
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,940
那他怎么说
So what did he say?

104
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,560
马修  弯下腰来  我好搂着你的肩说话
Marshall, bend down so I can put my arm around you.

105
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,050
这个高度差不多了  很好
That's all the way down. That's good.

106
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,500
格鲁伯药业公司的员工
Gruber Pharmaceuticals is a company full

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,280
都是一群尽职尽责的善良的人们
of well-meaning people doing their jobs,

108
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,700
就像你我一样
just like you and me.

109
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,950
各位  恐怕加里森・库兹变软弱了
Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison Cootes has gone soft!

110
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,970
他就像是只泰迪熊
He's like a teddy bear!

111
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,720
是像泰迪熊  还是伊渥克熊
A teddy bear or an Ewok?

112
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,720
Ewoks是《星际大战6 绝地归来》里帮助叛军击退帝国守军的毛怪

113
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,770
平日在村子里可爱惹人怜
You know, cute and cuddly around the village,

114
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,440
但一旦战争打响
but once the battle starts...

115
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,430
他会挥舞着巨大的木槌
He'll smash in your metal skull

116
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,760
击碎你的金盔铁甲
with giant swinging logs.

117
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,730
马修
Marshall!

118
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,160
好吧  他会一直抱着你
Okay, he'll hug you

119
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,780
直到你同意和平关闭死星
until you agree to peaceably shut down the Death Star.

120
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,030
嗨  宝贝
Hi, sweetie.

121
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,790
你们在说些什么呢
What are we all talking about?

122
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,520
伊渥克熊
Ewoks.

123
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,510
我讨厌那种熊
Ugh, I hate the Ewoks.

124
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,290
知道伊渥克熊在那部电影里  唯一的看点是什么吗
The only good thing about Ewoks in that movie?

125
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,270
就是其中几只死翘翘了
You got to see some of them die.

126
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,810
我想来杯扎啤
Well, I fancy a pint.

127
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,470
诺拉讨厌伊渥克熊
Nora hates Ewoks.

128
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,030
我必须跟她分手
Well, I have to break up with her.

129
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,700
各位  你们告诉她的时候婉转点
Be gentle when you tell her, guys.

130
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,130
我到了维加斯再联系你们
I'll call you from Vegas.

131
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,540
告诉我情况如何  闪了
Tell me how it went. Okay.

132
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
够了  巴尼
Okay, Barney!

133
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,760
乖乖坐下
Sit down!

134
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,480
不喜欢伊渥克族
Not liking Ewoks

135
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,530
不是什么分手的理由
is no reason not to date somebody.

136
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,750
没错  我是说
Yeah, I mean,

137
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,380
谁会乖乖遵守准则呀  对吧
who knows what the rules are, ya know?

138
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,960
你跟一个不喜欢伊渥克族的女孩约会
I mean, you're dating a girl who doesn't like Ewoks,

139
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,480
我跟我的前任心理医生约会
I'm dating my former therapist.

140
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,200
这太有失身份了
We are gentlemen of Harvard!

141
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,980
-这没什么大不了的  -罗宾
- It's not a big deal! - Robin,

142
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,340
如果你去问一百个人
if you asked a hundred people,

143
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,290
"最不该约会的对象是谁"
"Who's the worst person you could possibly date?"

144
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,220
他们都会说  "你的心理医师"
They'd all say, "Your therapist."

145
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,050
当然也会有人说是"巴尼"
Except the ones saying "Barney."

146
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,890
说得也有道理
Yeah, that tracks

147
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,790
我得走了
Well, I should get going.

148
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:05,710
明天我要带学生去实地勘察
I got the big field trip tomorrow.

149
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:06,620
实地勘察吗
Field trip?

150
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,750
是的  我要到巨人银行大楼的建筑工地
Yeah. I'm taking my Intro to Architecture class

151
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,800
实地上我的建筑入门课
to the GNB Tower construction site.

152
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,910
我试图让他们对
I'm trying to get them interested

153
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,440
建筑师这个职业产生兴趣
in architecture as a career.

154
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,190
为什么  难道我们这没别的大楼了吗
Why? Are we running out of buildings?

155
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,200
还是没有比他们更无聊的人了
Are we running out of boring people?

156
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,220
各位  这可是件大事  好不好
Guys, this is a big deal, okay?

157
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,210
哪怕我只让一个学生
If I can get just one kid interested in

158
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,910
燃起当建筑师的兴趣
becoming an architect...

159
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,990
好吧  我要打断你下
Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there.

160
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,490
泰德  这只是个入门课
Ted, it's an Intro class.

161
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,530
是啊  别指望在一个入门课上演《为人师表》的戏码
Yeah, don't try to Stand and Deliver an Intro class.

162
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:29,530
Stand and Deliver 根据真人真事改编 表彰优良教师的动人电影

163
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:32,530
没人会因为要寻求人生方向去上入门课
Nobody takes an Intro class to get on any other path

164
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,060
除了寻求解决宿醉的良方
but the path to not being hungover anymore.

165
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,070
我就在某某学入门课上学到这个
I learned that in my Intro to something-ology class.

166
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,600
对于某某学来说无所谓
Well that's fine for something-ology,

167
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,080
但明早九点整
but tomorrow at 9:00 a.M. Sharp

168
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,060
建筑学入门课就要实地勘察了
Intro to Architecture is going on a field trip!

169
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,750
全班两百人都会到齐哦
All 200 of 'em.

170
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,980
现在是9点45分
Well, it's 9:45.

171
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,450
我猜  另外170人应该是迷路了吧
I guess the other 170 of you got lost,

172
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,670
那我们就开始吧
so we'll just start.

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,780
有人可能会说  你们选这门课
Now, some might say you guys are just taking this class

174
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,180
是因为简单
because it's easy

175
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,560
又或是你们把建筑学误以为是考古学
or because you've confused architecture with archaeology

176
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,580
以为我们今天会像《夺宝奇兵》一样去探险
and think we're gonna do some cool Indiana Jones stuff today.

177
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,180
但我觉得
But I think that...

178
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,180
我觉得或许
I think just maybe,

179
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,780
我们当中会有人成为未来的建筑师
we got some future architects in the house.

180
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,470
你们谁以后想当建筑师呢
Show of hands: who's thinking about a career

181
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,870
举个手
in architecture?

182
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,100
好吧  今天  形势将会逆转
Well, today, all that's gonna change.

183
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,860
跟我来
Follow me.

184
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,550
对不起
Hey. Uh, sorry,

185
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,230
没有通行证不能入场
nobody gets in here without a site pass.

186
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,050
没事  我是泰德・莫斯比
It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby,

187
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,950
这栋楼的建筑师
the architect of this building.

188
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,120
我不管你是不是这栋楼的考古学家
I don't care if you're the archaeologist of this building.

189
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,780
此处禁止参观
Site's closed.

190
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,520
撤
Moving on!

191
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,340
那天早上  格鲁伯药业公司
That morning, Marshall's firm

192
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,980
将开出一个和解报价给马修的事务所
was getting the settlement offer from Gruber Pharmaceicals,

193
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,820
马修迫切想看到泰迪熊变身成伊渥克熊
and Marshall couldn't wait to see the teddy bear turn into an Ewok.

194
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,910
格鲁伯药业公司把有毒物质倒进青蛙溪
Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped toxic waste into Frog Creek,

195
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,790
这是鳟鱼河的一条支流  会流入清水湖
a tributary of the Trout River that feeds into Clearwater Lake.

196
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,970
现在这个三个地方  因为污染都要改名了
All three which now need new names.

197
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,870
是时候为地球母亲打一场胜战
So it's time to win one for Mother Earth.

198
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,750
让我们把那些垃圾干掉  好吗
Let's take out the trash, shall we?!

199
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,960
-好  -好的  每个人拿一个袋子
- Yes! - All right, everyone grab a bag.

200
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,730
蓝色是可循环  绿色是混合垃圾
Blue is recycling, green, compost.

201
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,850
出发
There we go.

202
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,840
希拉
Sheila...

203
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,720
说说你们的报价吧
we're ready to hear your offer.

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,930
24,000美元
$24,000?

205
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
还不错  挺合理的
Yeah , that seems reasonable.

206
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,250
孩子们  在我带着25个建筑入门班的学生
Kids, I was wandering the city

207
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,620
在这座城市里闲逛时
with 25 Intro to Architecture students

208
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,510
巴尼叔叔救了我一把
when your Uncle Barney came to my rescue.

209
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,010
各位  目睹一栋楼的建成  并没那么激动人心
Okay, guys, seeing a building get built, not that exciting.

210
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,620
真正令人激动的是财务状况
What's really exciting is the financial side of...

211
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,990
坐下  泰德  交给我吧
Sit down, Ted, I got this.

212
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,800
嘿  怪胡子  关灯
Hey, Weird Beard, lights!

213
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,460
大学  是个令人迷茫的时期
College... it's a confusing time.

214
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,640
完了
Oh, no.

215
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,210
研究表明  83%的大学生
Studies show that 83% of all college students

216
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,730
迫切地需要
desperately need...

217
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,910
性教育课程
sex lessons!

218
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,830
开灯
Lights!

219
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,510
巴尼  他们是青涩纯情的18岁
Barney, these are 18-year-olds!

220
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,980
泰德  他们是蠢蠢欲动的18岁
Ted, these are 18-year-olds!

221
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,220
你已经有女朋友了
You have a girlfriend.

222
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,570
但她不喜欢伊渥克熊
But she doesn't like Ewoks!

223
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,310
-那又怎样  -那又怎样
- So what? - So what?!

224
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,990
贾斯汀・比伯[发型像]  关灯
Bieber, lights!

225
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,190
1983年  乔治・卢卡斯把伊渥克熊带给了全世界
In 1983, George Lucas introduced the world to the Ewoks,

226
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,260
是恩多第二颗卫星上的一个生物种族
a race of creatures indigenous to the second moon of Endor.

227
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,490
电影里没有详细介绍
Now, the Ewoks have a rich back-story

228
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,830
伊渥克熊的背景
that the movie didn't really go into.

229
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,940
巴尼  要不你直接跳到
Barney, why don't you just skip

230
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,130
你和诺拉的那一段吧
to the part about you and Nora?

231
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,290
好吧
Fine.

232
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,240
对了
Ah, yes.

233
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,360
最终  伊渥克熊把星球大战的影迷分为两类
Ultimately, Ewoks split Star Wars fandom into two camps:

234
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,430
在此之前出生的  以及1973年5月25号之后出生的
those born before, and those born after May 25, 1973:

235
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,650
伊渥克熊分界线
the Ewok Line.

236
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,650
在伊渥克熊分界线左侧出生的人
Anyone born on this side of the Ewok Line was

237
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,230
至少绝地武士大10岁
at least ten years old when Jedi came out,

238
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,470
所以已经老到不喜欢那种甜腻可爱的东西
and thus too old for something so cloying and cute.

239
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,440
而出生在这半边的人
Anyone born on this side

240
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,920
都喜欢伊渥克熊  为什么呢
loved the Ewoks because, why?

241
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,230
因为它们会让你想起
They reminded you of...

242
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,150
泰迪熊吗
Our teddies?

243
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,030
它们会让你想起泰迪熊
They remded you of your teddies.

244
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,980
谢谢你  吉娜
Thank you, Gina.

245
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,300
你怎么知道她的名字
How do you know her name?

246
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,390
所以  根据伊渥克熊分界线的不二定律
And so... by the immutable laws of the Ewok Line,

247
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,580
我29岁的女朋友讨厌伊渥克熊
my 29-year-old girlfriend who hates Ewoks

248
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,590
那她肯定至少得有  37岁了
must in fact be no younger than... 37.

249
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,290
只比威尔的妈妈小一岁
That's only a year younger than Will's mom.

250
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,660
你怎么知道我妈的名字  下课
How do you know my mom? Class dismissed!

251
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,310
我要一个人静一静
I need to be alone.

252
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,390
好吧  我们撤
All right, we're moving on.

253
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,700
我能跟着吗
Ooh, can I come?

254
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,950
宝贝
Hey, baby.

255
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,620
提醒你一声  我们4点约了桑娅医生
Hey, I just want to remind you we have Dr. Sonya at 4:00.

256
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,340
我会去的  抱歉
I'll be there. I'm sorry.

257
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,740
我现在很郁闷
I'm just... I'm bummed.

258
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,580
我们今天拿到和解金了
We got our settlement offer today:

259
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,140
一个10亿美元的大公司只给我们2万4千美元
$24,000 from a billion-dollar company.

260
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,430
哇  那你公司的人肯定很不开心
Wow. I take it people aren't happy about that.

261
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,290
我们赢了  大家来喝香槟吃蛋糕吧
We won! Champagne and cake for everybody!

262
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,940
他们在庆祝
They're celebrating.

263
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,310
我是说  这太离谱了
I mean, it's crazy.

264
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,100
我们根本不配吃蛋糕
We have no right to be eating cake.

265
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,180
你那儿有蛋糕  我马上到
There's cake?! I'm on my way!

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,570
与此同时  史上最烂的实地勘察仍在进行
Meanwhile, the worst field trip of all time was still trucking.

267
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,380
好了  这同样激动人心  是吧
All right, this, this is exciting, okay?

268
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,730
我就在这个房间
This is the very room

269
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,230
设计出巨人国家银行的大楼
where I had the idea for the GNB Tower.

270
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,410
韦伯字典对“灵感”的定义是
Now, Webster's defines "Inspiration" As...

271
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,230
等下  页面还在缓冲
Hold on. It's still loading.

272
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
嘿  室友
Uh, hey, roomie.

273
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,210
罗宾  你在这儿干嘛
Robin! Hey, what are you doing here?

274
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,090
我正入"佳境"呢
Well, I was about to get my swerve on.

275
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,210
是吗
You were?

276
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,470
你就是那个心理医生
So you're the therapist.

277
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,480
假扮心理医生
You know, it's one thing to pretend to be a shrink

278
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,510
伺机和病人上床  这样很正常
and bang your patients. That's normal.

279
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,440
但如果真是医生与病人的关系
But to do it for real?

280
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,240
就有点别扭了  兄弟
A little creepy, bro.

281
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,670
够了  这有什么好别扭的
Okay, it's not creepy.

282
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,860
是...够别扭的
Ehhhh... it's creepy.

283
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,040
同学们  举手表决
Class, show of hands:

284
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,230
有谁觉得和自己的心理医生约会很别扭
Who thinks it's creepy to date your therapist?

285
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,030
-压倒性胜利  -滚出去
- Pollstered. - Get out!

286
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,550
好吧  我们撤
All right. We're moving on!

287
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,650
同学们  在左侧
So, class, to your left,

288
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,440
你们会看到一些设计精美的
you will see some excellent examples of

289
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,300
窗户样本
what we'd call windows.

290
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,970
我们现在要去哪里
So where are we going now?

291
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,730
我不知道
I have no idea.

292
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,900
这就是场灾难
This is a disaster.

293
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,440
有些人已经想回家了
Some of them are already starting to go home.

294
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,610
即使无意间多了个来旅游的德国家庭
Although we seem to have picked up a German family.

295
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,480
等等  等等
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

296
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,410
罗宾和她的心理医生约会的事
That thing with Robin and her creepy therapist

297
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,500
让我灵光一现
gave me an idea.

298
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,940
泰德  我们可以一次性解决

303
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,660
通心粉沙拉真的是一种沙拉吗

304
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,070

00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,080

谁同意爱德华
Who says Edward?

307

看来是真的
Hmm. It's true.

316
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,750
我想到一个  如果你在和一个女孩子约会
Okay. I've got one. If you're dating a girl,

317
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,890
她谎报了年龄
and she lies about her age,

318
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,210
你们会和她分手吗
who says break up with her?

319
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,350
对对  但是如果她撒谎的对象
Yes, yes, but what if the person she's lying to

320
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,340
是一个出了名地在乎年龄的人呢

321
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,770
但是如果在刚开始谈恋爱的时候
Okay, but what if early in our relationship,

322
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:30,790
她就郑重说过
she made a really big deal

323
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,480
不能对对方撒谎
about wanting to not lie to each other?

324
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,660
如果她很性感呢
What if she's hot?

325
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,840

我们开始吧
Let's do this.

328
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,170
算了吧  太别扭了
Okay, this is creepy.

329
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,670
跟克里斯平・格洛弗一样别扭

你向我敞开心扉
You shared intimate stuff.

333
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,100
这好像和你的妇科医生约会一样
It would be like dating your gynecologist.

334
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,260
你当时很脆弱
You were vulnerable.

335
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,010
我们不能当作没事发生
That's not something we can move past.

336
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,070
那倒是
Guess not.

337
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,380
和自己的妇科医生约会  也不好吗
So, dating your gyno, that's bad, too?

338
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,580
罗宾
Oh, Robin.

339
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,030
开个玩笑嘛
Kidding!

340
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,870
看  又一个蛋糕
Look, we've got another one!

341

Come on, have a bite.

342
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,270
不吃  这是原则问题
No, it's a matter of principle.

343

344
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,550
我绝对不会再吃第三块了
I'm not gonna have a third piece of cake!

345

朋友们  你们今天玩得都很尽兴
Okay, guys, you all had a lot of fun today,

346
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,250
现在  为了让大家更尽兴

再来一个蛋糕

你们都怎么了
What is the matter with you people?!

今天我们接受的和解金就是一堆灼热的[狗屎]
That settlement today was a flaming pile of...[shit]

351
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,160
小狗狗
puppies...

352
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,120
没有着火  只是发烧
that aren't on fire!

353
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,160
睁大眼看看  环境都成什么样了
Look at what's happening to the environment,

354
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,340
我们却在这里玩游戏
and we're here doing the limbo?

355
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,340
limbo stick把杠子越放越低  要弯下身子探过去的游戏

356
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,010
我们真该为自己感到耻辱
I mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves!

357
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,050
先生  我的意思是...
Sir, all I meant was...

358
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,000
十年之后
Ten years from right now,

359
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,960
外面房间里的人都会死去
everyone outside in that bullpen will be dead.

360
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,470
什么
What?

361
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,340
马修  我看了最近的研究
I've seen the latest research, Marsh.

362
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,670
我一直都在强调
You know how I'm always saying

363
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,100
拯救地球为时未晚
it's not too late to save the planet?

364
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,000
其实已经晚了
It's too late to save the planet.

365
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,900
我们无能为力
There's nothing to do but sit back

366
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,610
只能等待末日到来
and await our inevitable doom.

367
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,640
天啊   彩饰陶罐
Oh, my goodness, a Pinata

368
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,640
墨西哥人过圣诞节或生日将玩具糖果等礼物盛在此种罐内

369
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,960
再悬于天花板上  由蒙住眼的儿童用棒击破

370
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,960
拉里  再给我一分钟  谢谢
Just give me one minute, Larry. Thank you.

371
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:29,730
荒谬却又躲不掉的末日
Our grotesque, inevitable doom!

372
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,870
当然你现在不能告诉大家
Now, of course, you can't go around telling all the people

373
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,740
环境保护主义已是日薄西山
that the good ship Environmentalism has sailed off into the sunset.

374
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,680
那会引起恐慌
There would cause a panic.

375
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,630
相反  我们要做的
So, instead, what we do is,

376
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,190
上班的时候  保持微笑
we come to work, we put on a happy face,

377
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,950
趁太阳的辐射还没把我们烤干
and we sue the big guys

378
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,510
趁海水没有把我们淹没
for just enough money for some cake

379
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,400
我们就告告大公司的状
before the unfiltered rays of the sun fry us like chalupas,

380
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,310
捞点钱吃点蛋糕吧
and our lungs fill up with salt water,

381
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,460
反正最后都是一死
and we all die!

382
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,320
蛋糕很好吃  世界很美好
Mmm. This cake is delicious. Everything's fine.

383
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,920
今天太糟糕了
Ugh, this day sucks.

384
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,300
凯文和我拜拜了
Kevin and I are kaputski.

385
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,670
这也叫糟吗
You think that's bad?

386
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,800
世界末日就快来临了
The world is coming to an end.

387
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,960
那也叫糟吗
You think that's bad?

388
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,140
我的女朋友37岁了
My girlfriend is 37!

389
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,590
我的实地勘测之旅不如我预期中好
And my field trip is not going as well as I'd hoped.

390
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,170
今天太糟糕了
This day sucks.

391
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,290
莫斯比教授  实地勘察结束了吗
Professor Mosby, is the field trip over?

392
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,830
我们想回家了
We'like to go home.

393
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,520
已经结束了
Yeah, it's over.

394
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,200
再见[德语]
Auf wiedersehen.

395
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,290
我只不过想启发他们
I just wanted to inspire them,

396
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,690
就像我的教授曾经启发我一样
you know, like my professors inspired me.

397
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,110
可你看现在  一天就这么结束了
But here we are, at the end of the day...

398
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
同学们  问一句
Hey, class, quick question.

399
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,180
这里有谁想成为建筑师
Uh, is anyone here thinking of becoming an architect?

400
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,890
真的吗
Really?

401
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,580
是的  兄弟
Yeah, dude.

402
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,650
我的意思是  所有工作都很烂
I mean,all jobs suck,

403
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,620
可现在是下午四点
but it's 4:00 in the afternoon,

404
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,280
你却跟朋友在酒吧胡混
and you're out at a bar with your friends,

405
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,690
所以你这行也不见得太差
so the hours can't be that bad.

406
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,030
所以
So...

407
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,640
不好说  我会考虑下的
yeah, I don't know, I'd think about it.

408
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,140
终于说动一个了
I got through to you.

409
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,720
前提是  当DJ没戏的话
I mean, that is, if becoming a deejay doesn't pan out.

410
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,250
你会成为一名伟大的建筑师
You are gonna be a great architect.

411
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,610
<i>他后来成为了一名DJ</i>
<i>He became a deejay.</i>

412
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,330
罗宾  你来这儿干嘛
Robin, what are you doing here?

413
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,620
-我说了不能再做你的心理医生  -我知道
- I told you I can't be your therapist. - I know.

414
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,990
今天  我是你的心理医生
Today, I am your therapist.

415
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,860
什么
What?

416
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,830
你也说了
You said yourself,

417
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,970
我总找理由让自己不幸福
I'm always looking for reasons not to be happy.

418
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,300
我在努力改变这点
Well, I'm trying to change that.

419
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,640
如果我们不能在一起的原因
So, if the only reason we can't be together

420
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,450
是因为在初相识的两个钟头里
is because I was in a vulnerable place

421
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,910
我向你诉说了心底的秘密
for the first two hours we knew each other

422
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,300
那么应该换你  向我敞开心扉两小时
then that is two hours of vulnerability you owe me.

423
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,310
坐下吧
Sit down.

424
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:48,640
好吧
Okay.

425
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,720
不过先提醒你  我可是专业医生
Okay, but I must warn you, as a professional,

426
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,660
-不吃那一套  -先跟我说说你妈吧
- I'm immune to...- Tell me about your mother.

427
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,960
她就是个控制狂
Everything she says is a manipulation!

428
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,130
我7岁的时候
When I was seven years old...

429
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,260
库兹先生
Mr. Cootes.

430
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,490
我一直在想你昨天说的话
Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what you said yesterday,

431
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,160
你说最后大家都是死路一条
about how we're all gonna die.

432
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,770
我不会死的
Oh, I'm not gonna die.

433
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,010
我在科罗拉多买了个废弃矿井
I bought an old mine shaft in Colorado.

434
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,100
过去半年  我储备了充足的储备粮
I've spent the last six months filling it with canned goods,

435
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,860
步枪  还有全五季《周五夜现场》
assault rifles and all five seasons of Friday Night Lights.

436
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,670
首先我要说  第二季太烂了不用看
Okay, first of all, you can skip season two.

437
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:21,570
其次  我们谈话后
Second of all, after our talk...

438
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:25,010
我差点儿就决定放弃原则
I came pretty close to giving up myself.

439
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,020
但随后我陪老婆去看医生
But then I went to the doctor with my wife...

440
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,480
然后
and...

441
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,580
我看到了这个
I saw this.

442
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,280
男孩还是女孩
Boy or girl?

443
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,370
不知道
I don't know.

444
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,720
不过我十分确定的是  我要坚持原则
But I know I sure as hell can't give up now.

445
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,540
如果你只是想找个
So, if you're just looking for someone

446
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,680
没原则的人陪你玩游戏的话
to hold the other end of the limbo stick,

447
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,050
limbo stick腰力好的才能过 不适合高个子玩

448
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,320
那你就找错人了  知道为什么吗
you got the wrong guy for the job, and you know why?

449
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,050
因为你比同事都高上一米吗

就是去找格鲁伯药业公司
I'm walking down to Gruber Pharmaceuticals,

453

并拒绝他们的赔偿提议

我突然就无所谓了  因为我是真心喜欢你
I don't care, because I really like you.

那你第一次看见伊渥克熊时
