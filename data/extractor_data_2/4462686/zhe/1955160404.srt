Kim, I want you to know that I always pushed you harder

135
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:40,372

我有個新情況要告訴你們
there's some news you need to know about.

150
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:57,411
我不是安全的選擇
I am not the safe choice.

151
00:13:58,021 --> 00:14:00,311
安全的選擇是哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
The safe choice for you would be HHM.

152
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,401
但是我覺得
I believe, however, that I am...

153
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:05,311
我才是正確的選擇
the right choice.

154
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:06,961
為什么
Why?

155
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:11,071
你現在穿的西裝是店里買的成衣嗎
That suit you're wearing -- did you buy it off the rack?

156
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:13,301
別告訴我這看上去像
Please don't tell me it looks like I did. ‭

157
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:15,541
如果像店里隨便買的  我就不會問了
If it did, I wouldn't have asked.

158
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,731
那為什么你要選擇訂做的呢
So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?

159
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:23,421
因為那是最適合你的
Because it fits you and you alone.

160
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:27,661
每一針每一線都是為你考慮
Because each and every stitch was fretted over with you in mind.

161
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,171
要么你去適合西裝
Either you fit the jacket...

162
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,661
要么它適合你
or the jacket fits you.

163
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:39,651
如果我要一整個倉庫的西裝呢
What if I want ‭a whole warehouse full of suits?

164
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:42,761
需要很多人來縫制
That's a hell of a lot of sewing.

165
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:45,481
一個裁縫如何獨自完成這項任務呢
How's one single tailor gonna get that job done?

166
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:49,801
我完全了解你們銀行對于擴張的需求
I know your bank's needs in regard to this expansion inside and out.

167
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:51,591
梅薩維德作為我唯一的委托人
Having Mesa Verde as my sole client

168
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,101
一定會占用我全部的精力
will take up the entirety of my attention, to be sure.

169
00:14:55,631 --> 00:14:57,161
但如果我不能勝任
But if this were beyond my abilities,

170
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,921
我就不會接
I wouldn't be ‭throwing my hat in the ring.

171
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:01,751
我不會浪費你們的時間
I would not waste your time,

172
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,551
以及我的時間
or mine.

173
00:15:15,931 --> 00:15:17,611
你來啦  金  我們在里面
Oh, hey, Kim! We're in here!

00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,291
來得正好  我正在看房
Perfect timing. ‭I was just getting the tour.

175
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:24,781
-金  這是史蒂夫  -你好
- Kim, this is Steve. - ‭Hi.

176
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:25,731
史蒂夫是這里的中介
Steve's the agent for the place.

177
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:26,981
-你好  我叫金  -見到你很高興
- Hi. Kim. ‭- Nice to meet ya.

178
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:30,361
-金  -一切還好嗎
- Hi, Kim. - ‭Everything okay?

179
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,251
怎么樣
What do you think?

180
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:42,061
我  我覺得這是個牙醫診所吧
I, uh... I think it's a -- it's a dentist's office.

181
00:15:42,061 --> 00:15:44,941
兩間牙醫診室
Two offices for two dentists,

182
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:49,081
大小相同  陳設都是對稱的
each the exact same size with a mirrored layout.

183
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:50,881
來
Here.

184
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,241
另一間就在隔壁
The other one is the next door over,

185
00:15:53,241 --> 00:15:54,801
兩個靠在一起
right beside this one.

186
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:56,351
就在這
Right here.

187
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,031
但是共用一個大廳
But they share one lobby,

188
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:02,151
一個接待區  相當平等
one reception area, so egalitarian as hell.

189
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:04,361
而且很高效
Not to mention efficient.

190
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,221
還有
Oh, also...

191
00:16:09,911 --> 00:16:11,041
隔音墻壁
soundproof walls,

192
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:13,381
隔絕鉆子啊慘叫啊之類的聲音
what with the drilling and the pain and the whatnot.

193
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,701
還有這個地段  棒極了
And the location, I mean, holy crap.

194
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:18,521
我覺得就是這里了
I think this is the place.

195
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:24,291
金
Kim?

196
00:16:25,711 --> 00:16:27,331
是啊  很好  隔音的
Yeah, it's great. Soundproofing.

197
00:16:29,441 --> 00:16:31,741
史蒂夫  我們能不能單獨
Hey, Steve, do you mind if we just...?

198
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,371
沒事
Oh, please.

199
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,221
我出去打幾個電話
I'll step outside ‭and make some phone calls.

200
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,051
你們慢慢說
Y'all take all the time you need.

201
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:39,871
午飯不順利嗎
Bad lunch, huh?

202
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,541
梅薩維德拒絕了你嗎
Mesa Verde said no?

203
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,421
我弄不清情況了
Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here.

204
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:58,711
這是代表好的...
I-is this a good --

205
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:01,011
吉米  我搞定了
Jimmy, I got it.

206
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,061
-你搞定梅薩維德銀行了  -太好了
- You got Mesa Verde? ‭- Yes!

207
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,951
還沒簽正式文件
I mean, ‭there's nothing in writing yet,

208
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,321
但是午餐非常
but the lunch went...

209
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,861
非常順利
It kicked ass.

210
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,191
當時形勢確實有點危險
It was a little touch-and-go there for a moment, I'll admit,

211
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:14,331
但佩琪替我說話  幫了很大的忙
but Paige pitched in, and she really talked me up.

212
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:16,321
一等他松了口...
And then once ‭that door cracked open --

213
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:18,871
擊個掌  棒極了
High five. Fantastic. ‭

214
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,681
我對每一個問題和擔憂都準備了答案
I-I had an for answer question, every concern,

215
00:17:22,681 --> 00:17:24,801
也完全沒說哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所的壞話
and I did not bad-mouth HHM, not at all,

216
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,521
但是我很有激情
but I was, like, enthusiasm, you know,

217
00:17:27,521 --> 00:17:30,481
還有私人服務  肯定也因為這個
and personal service, because that's gotta count for something.

218
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:33,181
-當然了  -就是啊
- Shit, yeah, that counts! - ‭Exactly!

219
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:33,981
畢竟
I mean, 'cause, like,

220
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:36,131
他們一開始怎么會到哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所
why were they even at HHM in the first place?

221
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:38,781
還不是因為我  所以  我們走出餐館時
Me. So, uh -- Oh, and then when we walked out of the restaurant,

222
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:41,581
凱文看不見的時候  佩琪朝我豎大拇指
when Kevin wasn't looking, Paige gives me a thumbs-up.

223
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:43,301
不是普通的豎一根
But not -- ‭not the regular thumbs-up.

224
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:44,441
是兩根
The double thumbs-up.

225
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:45,811
兩個  雙筒槍
Two. ‭Double barrel.

226
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:47,691
砰砰  像這樣
Boom, boom. Just like that.

227
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,471
我就知道
I knew it.

228
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:51,051
-我就知道你可以的  -真是...
- I knew you could do it! - ‭It was just...

229
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,091
真是太好了
God, it was perfect.

230
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:59,401
怎么了
What?

231
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:04,761
我喜歡看到你現在的樣子
I just -- ‭I love seeing you like this.

232
00:18:07,311 --> 00:18:08,741
我們要留著這些椅子嗎
So, are we gonna keep these chairs?

233
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:11,841
你是說你喜歡這個辦公室嗎
Does that mean you like this office?

234
00:18:13,411 --> 00:18:14,601
咱們就這么辦吧
Let's do it.

235
00:18:15,231 --> 00:18:16,431
沒問題
Hell, yeah.

236
00:18:16,481 --> 00:18:17,951
就這么辦吧
Let's do it.

237
00:18:28,391 --> 00:18:30,401
歐內斯托  門沒鎖
Ernesto, the door's open...

238
00:18:31,181 --> 00:18:32,621
像往常一樣
...as always.

239
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:35,511
歐內斯托
Ernesto?

240
00:18:36,331 --> 00:18:37,431
是我  查克
It's me, Chuck.

241
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,031
霍華德  歐內斯托和你一起嗎
Oh, hey, Howard, is Ernesto with you?

242
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,431
沒有  只有我
No, it's just me.

243
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:44,931
我等文件等了一個小時了
Well, I expected a round of documents an hour ago.

244
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:46,281
我們馬上要去立案了
You know ‭we've got a filing coming up.

245
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,651
我知道  查克
I know, Chuck.

246
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:49,161
我們很有可能...
It's very possible...

247
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:53,301
我們可能要失去梅薩維德銀行了
It's likely ‭that we're losing Mesa Verde.

248
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:56,051
失去  我們剛剛才拿下他們
Losing them? We just got them.

249
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:58,861
為什么  他們打算去找誰
Well, why? Where are they going?

250
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,331
去找金·韋克斯勒
They're going with Kim Wexler.

251
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,641
她職辭了
‭She left the firm.

252
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:05,231
金辭職了
Kim left?

253
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,781
霍華德
Oh, Howard.

254
00:19:11,561 --> 00:19:14,071
她要去哪里
Well, where's she going?

255
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:15,621
里奇·斯韋卡特那里嗎
Is it Rich Schweikart?

256
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,061
還是里夫斯和格林公司
Or did Reeves and Green get her?

257
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:18,721
都不是  不是跳槽
Mnh. Not another firm.

258
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,381
她要單干了
She's going into private practice.

259
00:19:20,381 --> 00:19:21,451
什么
What?

260
00:19:21,521 --> 00:19:22,981
這真是...
Well, that's completely...

261
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:27,391
她要怎么自己單干呢
H-how is she going out on her own?

262
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,601
她為什么要單干呢
Why is she going out on her own?

263
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:31,471
沒什么原因
Well, the why is the why.

264
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:36,731
至于怎么干  她正準備和吉米聯手
The how is that ‭she's pooling her resources... with Jimmy.

265
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:44,861
金和我弟弟  成了合伙人嗎
Kim and my brother -- partners at law?

266
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:48,381
他是斯文加利
He's Svengali.

267
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:49,911
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}小說《特里比》中的人物  用催眠術控制女主人公

268
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,911
這家伙是個催眠大師
The man is Svengali.

269
00:19:50,611 --> 00:19:52,761
不管怎樣  關于梅薩維德銀行
At any rate, back to Mesa Verde.

270
00:19:53,031 --> 00:19:55,031
我打算孤注一擲
I'm gonna try one last Hail Mary.

271
00:19:55,991 --> 00:19:57,631
查克
Uh, Chuck?

272
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,341
-梅薩維德銀行  -我聽著呢
- Mesa Verde. - ‭Yes, listening.

273
00:19:59,341 --> 00:20:01,061
我爭取了一個和凱文·沃弛泰爾見面的機會
I managed to get a meeting with Kevin Wachtell.

274
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,401
他下午到
He's coming in this afternoon.

275
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,251
但我不是很清楚該遵從哪些法
But compliance law is not my strong suit.

276
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:08,351
所以如果你有任何論點論據
So if you have any details, any arguments,

277
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,771
現在趕快告訴我
bullet-point them for me now,

278
00:20:09,771 --> 00:20:11,941
我只有一個小時的時間
'cause I got about an hour before I have to get back.

279
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,511
查克
Chuck?

280
00:20:15,761 --> 00:20:17,281
我真的很需要你的幫助
I really need your help here.

281
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:23,191
查克
Chuck?

282
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:29,851
你還好吧
Are you okay?

283
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:32,111
我也去參加會議
I'm going to that meeting.

284
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,981
查克  這樣也許不好吧
Chuck, I don't know if that's a good idea.

285
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:36,231
我可以的
I can do it.

286
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:37,561
我會靠意志力堅持
Force of will.

287
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:38,381
而且我已經好多了
And I've been getting better.

288
00:20:38,381 --> 00:20:40,101
我知道  但是...
I know you have, but...

289
00:20:40,961 --> 00:20:42,781
想想我們要傳遞的信息
the message that we want to send.

290
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,351
我懂
I know the message --

291
00:20:44,351 --> 00:20:46,821
要表現得專業  而不是瘋狂
that we appear professional and not crazy!

292
00:20:47,151 --> 00:20:49,831
我要去開會  燈給我開著
I'm going to the meeting and the lights stay on.

293
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:51,821
大家都帶著手機
Everyone keeps their phones.

294
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:55,351
一切正常就行
Everything stays, for lack of a better word, normal.

295
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,821
我會挺過來的
I will make it through.

296
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:22,621
請進
‭Yeah?

297
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,741
他們到了
They're here.

298
00:21:26,121 --> 00:21:27,381
好的
Okay.

299
00:21:53,381 --> 00:21:54,741
大家好
Hello, everyone.

300
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:55,921
-抱歉我來晚了  -你們好
- Sorry I was delayed. - Oh. Hi.

301
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:57,291
不不  完全沒有  我們剛坐下
No, no. Not at all. We just sat down.

302
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,671
凱文·沃弛泰爾  佩奇·諾維克
Kevin Wachtell, Paige Novick,

303
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,771
這位是查爾斯·麥吉爾
this is Charles McGill.

304
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:00,361
叫我查克就好
Chuck.

305
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,411
很高興見到你們  凱文  佩奇
Pleasure. Kevin. Paige.

306
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:02,621

Nice to meet you.

307
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,841
感謝你們兩位前來
Thank you both for coming.

308
00:22:05,131 --> 00:22:06,041
別擔心
And don't worry.

309
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:09,141
請二位來不是來聽我吹噓HHM的
I'm not here ‭to extol the virtues of HHM.

310
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:11,921
我猜你們已經受夠了
‭I'm guessing you've already had to suffer through

311
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,871
霍華德對于律所的強行推銷了
Howard's hard sell first time around,

312
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,081
依我看  你們已經聽夠了
so you've done your time, as far ‭as I'm concerned.

313
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:19,561
才不是強行推銷  那只是熱情待客
What hard sell? It was enthusiasm.

314
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:20,661
我還給他們拿了餅干呢
I gave them cookies.

315
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:22,521
我記得餅干還挺好吃的
Cookies were good, as I recall.

316
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:24,631
我今天來是想讓你們放心
No, I'm here to put your minds at ease.

317
00:22:24,631 --> 00:22:25,641
金·韋克斯勒
Kim Wexler is,

318
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:28,681
的確是處理梅薩維德業務的不二人選
indeed, the right choice to handle Mesa Verde.

319
00:22:29,551 --> 00:22:31,301
選擇她很明智
She's the obvious choice.

320
00:22:31,471 --> 00:22:35,911
她年輕又聰明  前途無量
She's young, she's brilliant, she's going places.

321
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:38,491
咱們面對現實吧  霍華德
Let's face it, Howard.

322
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:40,121
她才是未來
She's the future.

323
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:42,511
像我倆這種老人家  已經過時了
Two old guys like us, we're the past.

324
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:45,791
真是讓人悲傷的看法
Well, that's a sad thought.

325
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:47,671
悲傷但真實
‭Sad but true.

326
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:52,851
銀行法...需要激情
Banking law... needs to be exciting.

327
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,241
需要下一代崛起的新秀
It needs the next generation to come along

328
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:57,851
為它注入新鮮血液
and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.

329
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:59,241
真正喚醒它
Really wake it up.

330
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:01,321
我告訴你們我有多無聊
Let me tell ya how boring I am.

331
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:05,661
我靠讀FEC和ISO報告來打發時間
I read FEC and ISO reports for entertainment.

332
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:08,251
沒錯  我能證明
He does. I can attest to that.

333
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:10,361
我想努力跟上潮流
Well, I try to stay up on things.

334
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:12,721
規則時刻在改變
The rules are changing all the time.

335
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,341
安然和世通出事了以后
With everything that's happened with Enron and WorldCom,

336
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:17,461
政府格外警惕
the government is extra vigilant.

337
00:23:17,461 --> 00:23:19,661
現在  即便是最無心的過錯
These days, the penalties for even the most honest

338
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,871
也可能招致毀滅性的后果
of errors can be devastating.

339
00:23:22,061 --> 00:23:25,651
你需要年輕敏銳的眼光把握這些動向
You need a sharp, ‭young eye to catch that stuff.

340
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,281
當你已經在這個領域
I mean, when you've specialized in this kind of work

341
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:32,891
縱橫了十多年  就會變得有點...
for decades on end, you tend to get kinda...

342
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:34,731
-陳腐  -陳腐
- Stale. ‭- Stale.

343
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:36,061
你會變得很陳腐
You get stale.

344
00:23:36,061 --> 00:23:38,601
你會忘掉那些  譬如
You forget about things like, oh, I don't know,

345
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,231
《社區再投資法案》
the Community Reinvestment Act.

346
00:23:40,231 --> 00:23:43,741
像梅薩維德銀行這樣想設新支行的銀行
Any bank such as Mesa Verde looking to open a de novo branch

347
00:23:43,741 --> 00:23:47,281
必須展現符合該法案的
is definitely going to need to show a healthy portfolio

348
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:49,041
健康投資組合
of CRA compliance.

349
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,561
當然是開玩笑的了
Duh. Obviously.

350
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,721
我相信這方面你們肯定都做好了
You guys have all that covered, I'm sure.

351
00:23:53,831 --> 00:23:57,391
《里格-尼爾州際銀行和分行效益法》
Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act --

352
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:59,721
真是拗口啊
there's another mouthful, huh?

353
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:01,051
無聊
Boring!

354
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:03,521
不過如果你違反該法律
Still, ‭if you were to run afoul of it,

355
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:05,371
可能得打上好幾年官司
it could hold you up in court for years.

356
00:24:05,371 --> 00:24:10,061
順便  如果你們在沒有我們的情況下
And by the way, uh, if that were to happen to you folks

357
00:24:10,061 --> 00:24:13,501
發生這種事  不過當然不會了
as you go forward without us, which it will not, um,

358
00:24:13,511 --> 00:24:16,821
霍華德在美聯儲有人能夠幫忙處理這些事
Howard has contacts at the Fed who could help sort things out.

359
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:17,931
一兩個吧
One or two.

360
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:20,511
還有證券交易委員會對
And then there's the SEC's interpretation

361
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,351
《薩奧法案》302節的闡釋
of Section 302 of Sarbox.

362
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:25,991
小心行事
Well, navigating that correctly

363
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,911
可以省下好幾十萬呢
could mean savings of several hundred thousand dollars.

364
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,501
他們很清楚呢  霍華德
They know that, Howard.

365
00:24:30,781 --> 00:24:32,031
抱歉
Aapologize.

366
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:33,851
人到了一定歲數
When you reach your golden years,

367
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:35,921
就會變得有點啰啰嗦嗦
you tend ‭to get a little long-winded,

368
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:38,251
老是念叨著一些細節
ramble on and on about details.

369
00:24:38,251 --> 00:24:42,711
我想說的是  你的銀行在可靠的人手上
My point being, ‭your bank is in excellent hands.

370
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,951
我明白你想說什么  真的
Look, I take your point. I do.

371
00:24:54,491 --> 00:24:55,291
但我要說
But I have to say,

372
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:58,161
我對韋克斯勒女士很有信心
I have complete confidence in Ms. Wexler.

373
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,251
你是該如此
You should.

374
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:00,831
她在我們團隊中待過
She was part of our team.

375
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,271
她師從我們
She learned from us.

376
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:05,131
找不到比金·韋克斯勒更合適的人選了
You won't find better than Kim Wexler.

377
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:08,931
但是不管她多么優秀
But no matter how talented one individual may be,

378
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:11,791
梅薩維德的業務太重  一個人沒法做
the needs of Mesa Verde are too big to handle alone.

379
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,141
我是不會單獨處理你們今后的擴張
I wouldn't handle ‭your coming expansion alone.

380
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:18,671
所以你應該再考慮一下
Which is why you should consider, once again,

381
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:21,241
交給我們這樣專業的團隊

開什么玩笑  這是我的榮幸

為了戰爭英雄  可以小小地破個例

不  我...我是他們家的律師

不過大家現在正在吃午飯

你以為這么好找  這家伙欠我的

就不能把這家伙放國旗前嗎
Couldn't just plop the dude in front of a flag?

468

為什么非要來這
Why'd we have to come here?

‭So what happened?

547

他們繼續和哈姆林麥吉爾聯合律所合作

我們馬上要簽下非常貴的租約

563
00:32:57,346 --> 00:33:01,556
但一大筆收入已經不翼而飛了
after a very sizable chunk of income just went flying out the window.

564
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,926
這就是團隊的意義
That's why we're a team.

565
00:33:03,966 --> 00:33:05,666
這種事總會發生
Something like this happens --

不用  我沒事
No, I'm fine.

624
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:58,383
等我的胃不難受了我自己弄點東西吃
I'll fix myself something after my stomach settles.

625
00:42:58,763 --> 00:43:00,733
在外面待這么久
Really doing a number on yourself,

626
00:43:01,263 --> 00:43:04,083
真把你傷得不輕
spending so much time out of the house.

627
00:43:05,503 --> 00:43:06,893
你就非得這么干  是吧
You just had to do it, huh?

628
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,773
不能眼看著金挖走梅薩維德銀行
Couldn't stand ‭to let Kim have Mesa Verde.

629
00:43:09,773 --> 00:43:11,103
就非得從她手上搶走
You had to swipe it from her.

630
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:12,613
我沒有搶走任何東西
I didn't swipe anything.

631
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:14,143
我們只是留住委托人
We retained our client.

632
00:43:14,143 --> 00:43:17,533
你和霍華德甚至都沒聽說過這個銀行
You and Howard never even heard about Mesa Verde

633
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:20,083
是金把它捧到你們面前的
till Kim brought it to ya on a red velvet pillow.

634
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:28,283
我要去沖個澡  還有一堆工作要處理
I need a shower, and I've got a ton of work to do.

635
00:43:28,763 --> 00:43:30,463
如果你想吵架  吉米
So if you're lookin' for a fight, Jimmy,

636
00:43:30,463 --> 00:43:32,863
我實在沒心情和你吵
I just don't have it in me.

637
00:43:39,213 --> 00:43:40,173
吉米
Jimmy.

638
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:43,623
謝謝你留下來陪我
Thanks for stayin' with me.

639
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:48,063
我們之間有積怨未解
I know we have our issues,

640
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:51,153
但是  如果我倆換一下
but if things were reversed,

641
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:54,923
我希望你知道  我也會一樣待你
I hope you know that I would do the same for you.

642
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,103
干得真不錯
You're doing a great job.

643
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:25,893
你以前做過這個嗎
You done this before?

644
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:28,453
沒有  沒做過這樣的
No, not like this,

645
00:44:28,643 --> 00:44:31,443
不過我們在學校里學過分數
but we learned about fractions in school.

646
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:34,003
是嗎  什么分數
You did? What fractions?

647
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:36,393
二分之一英寸  四分之一英寸
1/2 inch, 1/4 inch,

648
00:44:36,393 --> 00:44:39,413
八分之一英寸  十六分之一英寸
1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.

649
00:44:41,263 --> 00:44:42,653
你知道嗎  我得承認
You know, I gotta tell ya,

650
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:46,093
我在你這個年紀的時候可沒你聰明
you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.

651
00:44:46,093 --> 00:44:49,263
或許是你老師教得不夠好
Maybe you needed better teachers.

652
00:44:50,423 --> 00:44:51,683
有可能
That could be.

653
00:44:52,203 --> 00:44:53,713
能讓我來鉆嗎
Can I do the drill now?

654
00:44:53,723 --> 00:44:56,083
你答應了的
You promised.

655
00:44:57,423 --> 00:45:00,083
是呀  我是答應了
I did, didn't I?

656
00:45:00,703 --> 00:45:02,033
好了  過來
Okay, get up here.

657
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:05,623
用重型工具的時候
Now, you're gonna have to wear these

658
00:45:05,623 --> 00:45:07,603
得戴上這個
if you're gonna handle the heavy machinery.

659
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:10,013
你怎么不戴
W-why don't you have to wear them?

660
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,973
因為爺爺是大人  長大了就會變笨
Because Pop-Pop's a grown-up, and grown-ups get to be stupid.

661
00:45:13,973 --> 00:45:16,053
好了  戴上
Now, put them on.

662
00:45:16,683 --> 00:45:17,623
好的
All right.

663
00:45:18,013 --> 00:45:21,283
這個很重  所以我來拿著
Now, I'm gonna hold this because it's heavy,

664
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:24,093
我說按扳柄的時候你就按  行嗎
but you pull the trigger when I say so, okay?

665
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:25,523
把手放上來
Now get your hand on it.

666
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,583
好了  拿好了嗎
All right, you got it?

667
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,043
準備好了
Ready.

668
00:45:29,043 --> 00:45:32,873
好的  準備  按
All right, ready...set...pull.

669
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:37,513
干得好
Good job.

670
00:45:37,513 --> 00:45:39,683
能再來幾次嗎
Can we do more? ‭

671
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:41,163
你幫我放好
You line them up for me.

672
00:45:42,033 --> 00:45:42,993
在家嗎
Hello?!

673
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:44,703
我們在后面
We're back here.

674
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:51,513
這是在干什么
Wow. What's all this?

675
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:53,573
我們在做一個特制軟管
We're making a special hose.

676
00:45:53,573 --> 00:45:56,603
特制軟管啊  看出來了
Yeah, that's a special hose, all right.

677
00:45:56,733 --> 00:45:59,013
我每隔四分之三英寸做一個記號
I made marks every 3/4 inch,

678
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:00,823
然后爺爺在下面墊上一塊木頭
then Pop-Pop put a piece of wood down

679
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,683
這樣就不會劃到桌子了
so he doesn't ruin his table.

680
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:06,073
然后我們在標記號的地方鉆孔
Then we line up a drill, put the hole on the "X."

681
00:46:08,613 --> 00:46:12,093
我要給外面的杜鵑花做個滴灌管
I needed a soaker ‭for the rhododendrons out back.

682
00:46:12,953 --> 00:46:15,363
好了  爺爺要自己完成工作了
Well, Pop-Pop's gonna have to finish his project on his own,

683
00:46:15,363 --> 00:46:16,443
我們得走了
because we have to go.

684
00:46:16,443 --> 00:46:18,443
可我們還沒做完呢
But we're not done yet.

685
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,233
沒事  我會做好的
No, I'll finish up.

686
00:46:20,233 --> 00:46:23,653
小公主  你已經幫了我很大的忙了
But you, young lady, were a big help.

687
00:46:24,263 --> 00:46:25,303
抱抱
Give me a hug.

688
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,233
愛你  寶貝
Love you, girl.

689
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:34,173
-我也愛你  -謝謝  麥克
- Love you. ‭- Thanks, Mike.

690
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:35,483
對了  你周五還是有空的吧
Oh, you still good for Friday?

691
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:36,513
當然
Absolutely.

692
00:46:36,513 --> 00:46:38,553
我到時候再找個東西讓她玩
I'll think of another project by then.

693
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:40,223
太好了  再見
Fantastic. Bye.

694
00:46:40,223 --> 00:46:41,183
再見
Bye.

695
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:15,493
我午餐已經約了人了
I have a lunch date already.

696
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:17,273
-推了  -不能推
- Well, break it. - ‭I cannot break it.

697
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:18,453
能別碰我嗎
Will you take your hands off me?

698
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:19,793
你以為你在演正骨醫生嗎
What are you playing, osteopath?

699
00:47:19,793 --> 00:47:20,723
別激動
Temper, temper.

700
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:23,703
沃爾特  你已經不是我的丈夫了
Oh, listen, Walter, you are no longer my husband

701
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:25,373
也不再是我的老板
and no longer my boss.

702
00:47:25,373 --> 00:47:26,933
我以后也不會再為你工作了
And you're not gonna be my boss.

703
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:29,733
如果你滿足于當編輯和記者
Well, it would've worked out if you'd been satisfied

704
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:32,293
事情就不會這樣  可你就不
with just being editor and reporter, but not you.

705
00:47:32,293 --> 00:47:33,993
你非要嫁給我  毀了這一切
You had to marry me, spoil everything.

706
00:47:33,993 --> 00:47:37,053
我不滿足  那是我求的婚咯
I wasn't satisfied? I suppose I proposed to you.

707
00:47:37,143 --> 00:47:38,873
差不多就是  你連著兩年
Well, you practically did, making goo-goo eyes at me

708
00:47:38,873 --> 00:47:40,153
整天對我送秋波  直到我松口
for two years until I broke down.

709
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:41,503
"啊  沃爾特"
"Oh, Walter."

710
00:47:41,603 --> 00:47:44,003
而且我那晚是喝醉了才向你求的婚
And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed to ya.

711
00:47:44,003 --> 00:47:44,763
如果你是個紳士
If you'd have been a gentleman,

712
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:46,363
就該忘了那晚的事  可你就不
you'd have forgotten all about it, but not you.

713
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,363
你竟敢
Why, you!

714
00:47:47,513 --> 00:47:48,223
你眼力不如以往了
You're losing your eye.

715
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,663
你以前扔得可比這準多了
You used to be able to pitch better than that.

716
00:47:49,663 --> 00:47:52,513
你好  是的  怎么了  斯威尼
Hello? Yeah. What? Sweeney?

717
00:47:52,523 --> 00:47:53,943
有什么我能幫忙的嗎
Well, what can I do for ya?

24
