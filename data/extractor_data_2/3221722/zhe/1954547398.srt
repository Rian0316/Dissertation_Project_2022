1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,230
你觉得怎么样?
So what'd you think?

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,230
还不错
It was good.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,730
就这样?
That's it?

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,560
"还不错"?
"Good"?

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,530
我挺喜欢的 当你告诉我
I enjoyed it. When you told me

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,360
我马上就要"失去第一次"的时候
I was going to be "losing my virginity,"

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,130
我可没想到你是指要第一次给我看
I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:23,630
"夺宝奇兵"
for the first time.

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,660
抱歉 是我表达不清
My apologies. I chose my words poorly.

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
我应该说你的世界
I should have said you were about

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,560
将在我的沙发上颠倒
to have your world rocked on my couch.

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,960
谢谢你陪我看
Anyway, thank you for watching it.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,330
这是我一直以来很喜欢的电影之一
It's one of my all-time favorites.

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,160
电影很有趣...
It was very entertaining...

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,500
虽然有很明显的故事漏洞
despite the glaring story problem.

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,930
故事漏洞?!
Story problem?!

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,130
你... Amy...
You... oh, Amy...

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,960
你这眼神不济的小笨蛋
what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.

19
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,630
"夺宝奇兵"
Raiders of the Lost Ark

20
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,060
是史蒂芬·斯皮尔伯格和乔治·卢卡斯的佳作
is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

21
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,660
这两位是当代最有才华的电影制作人
two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,160
我看了36遍
I've watched it 36 times,

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,900
除了那场有蛇的还有脸融化的戏
except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene,

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,930
我只有在影院里才敢看 但是...
which I can only watch when it's still light out, but...

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,200
我不信你能找出故事漏洞
I defy you to find a story problem.

26
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,530
说说看... 看能不能惊得我合不拢嘴
Here's my jaw... drop it.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,560
好吧
All right.

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,700
印第安纳·琼斯对故事发展
Indiana Jones plays no role

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,160
没有任何作用
in the outcome of the story.

30
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,860
哪怕电影里没有他
If he weren't in the film,

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,160
结果都是一模一样的
it would turn out exactly the same.

32
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,660
我知道你为什么这么说 你没看懂
Oh, I see your confusion. You don't understand.

33
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,630
印第安纳·琼斯是这个戴着帽子拿着鞭子的
Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.

34
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,630
我看懂了 如果电影里没有他
No, I do, and if he weren't in the movie,

35
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,560
纳粹还是会找到约柜
the Nazis would have still found the ark,

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,600
把它带上小岛 打开 然后全部死光...
taken it to the island, opened it up and all died...

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,030
结果完全一样
just like they did.

38
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,530
我来帮你合起来

嗨! 我以为你每周三
Hi! I thought you went

51
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,060
才会去漫画书店呢
to the comic book store on Wednesdays.

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,130
没错 不过Sheldon和Amy在约会
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night

53
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,330
我可不想在那儿尴尬着
and they don't need me there to make it awkward.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,730
他们俩已经够尴尬了
They have each other for that.

55
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,060
学校生活怎么样?
So, how was school?

56
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,430

"令人失望的孩子" Beverly Hofstadter著
The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,100
你买了我妈写的书?
You bought my mom's book?

59
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,260
没错!
Yeah!

60
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,460
心理学课程的推荐书单上
It's on the recommended reading list

61
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,730
就有这本书
for my psychology class.

62
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,600
拜托 别读那本书
Come on. Not that book.

63
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,900
里面... 写了我童年时代
It... it's got, like, every horrible story

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,060
所有的糗事
from my childhood in it.

65
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,060
真棒 那有照片吗?
Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

66
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,700
说真的 你还是换本书看吧
Seriously, please find another book.

67
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,760
得了吧 为什么? 有那么糟吗?
Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,830
里面... 写了教我学用尿盆的事
There... there's chapters about potty training,

69
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,000
还有我尿床的事...
and bed-wetting and...

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,400
和自慰的事
masturbation.

71
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,760
基本上 只要有东西从我身体里出来
Basically, if something came out of me,

72
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,260
她就写了进去!
she wrote about it!

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,860
这样吧 你想看就看
You know what? Do whatever you want,

74
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,200
但千万别跟我说里面的事情
just don't talk to me about it.

75
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,030
哺乳危机的那章都不行?
Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?

76
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,260
那根本不算是危机
It was not a crisis.

77
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,100
我更喜欢左边的
Apparently, I favored the left one,

78
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,760
所以她的胸左右不对称了
she got a little lopsided.

79
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,200
天啊 你一直喜欢左边!
Oh, my God, you still go left!

80
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,130
你觉得我最像哪个名人?
Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?

81
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,260
哈里·贝瑞
Halle Berry.

82
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,800
干嘛问这个?
Why?

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
我和Stuart在交友网上填写个人档案
Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online,

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,100
里面就有这个问题
and it's one of the questions.

85
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,060
谢谢夸奖... 这个妹子的脸部轮廓我超级羡慕
And thank you... I'd kill for that woman's bone structure.

86
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,430
你怎么在读"傲慢与偏见"?
Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?

87
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,830
我来告诉你原因
I'll tell you why.

88
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,800
Amy毁了我对"夺宝奇兵"的爱
Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,

89
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,430
所以现在我也得看看
so now I'm trying to find

90
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,660
怎么能毁了她对这本书的爱
something beloved to her and ruin that.

91
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,100
她还不够惨?
Because her life wasn't enough?

92
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,460
等等... 怎么有人能毁了"夺宝奇兵"?
Wait... how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders?

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,500
这电影很完美
It's perfect.

94
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,760
没错 但印第安纳·琼斯
Yeah, except for the fact

95
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,500
跟整个故事没有任何联系
that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story.

96
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,560
无论有没有他 纳粹都会找到约柜 打开 然后死掉
With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,460
嘿 等等
Hey, wait a minute.

98
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,600
不是这样 纳粹本来挖错了地方
No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place.

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,260
就因为印第安纳先找到了约柜
The only reason they got the ark

100
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,830
他们才能找到的
was because Indy found it first.

101
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,730
事实上 就因为吊坠在印第安纳手里
Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place

102
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:05,060
他们才会挖错地方的
because Indy had the medallion.

103
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,560
要是没有他 吊坠一开始就在纳粹手里
Without him, they would have had the medallion

104
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,300
他们也就能挖对地方了
and dug in the right place.

105
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
好吧 我知道你不想
Okay, I know you don't

106
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,200
谈这件事
want to talk about it,

107
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,700
但我能不能就问一个书里的问题?
but can I just ask you one question about your mom's book?

108
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,630
不能
No.

109
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,100
我只是想知道
I just want to know

110
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,400
一个五岁男孩干嘛要涂妈妈的化妆品
why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom's makeup

111
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,930
还拿气球当假胸
and wears balloon boobies.

112
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,200
那不是假胸 是假肌肉
They weren't boobies, they were muscles.

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,500
而且我涂了绿色的彩妆
And the makeup was green.

114
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,800
就是想假装绿巨人
I was pretending to be The Hulk.

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,300
但你戴了她的胸罩
You were wearing her bra.

116
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,000
那是为了不让我的肌肉下垂!
That was to keep my muscles from sagging!

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
我们能不能不说这事儿了?!
Can we please stop talking about this?!

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,760
好吧 不说了
Okay, okay.

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,030
不过 作为一名
But you know, as a student of psychology

120
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:52,260
首次作业就得了优加的心理学学生...
who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment...

121
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,830
我认为 有时候把事情谈开了比较好
I think, sometimes, it's good to open up about these things.

122
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,000
好吧
Okay, fine.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
你想知道我为什么打扮成绿巨人吗?
Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk?

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,830
因为我总是生我妈的气
Because I was always mad at my mom

125
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,160
想从那个家砸出一条生路来
and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,230
你为什么那么生气?
Well, why were you so angry?

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,700
天 我不知道 或许是因为
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's because

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,760
我总是她那些小实验的对象
I was always the subject of her little experiments.

129
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,660
你看到那章没 她导演了一场没有彩蛋的复活节寻蛋活动
Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt

130
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,160
就想看我会找多久
with no eggs to see how long I'd keep looking?

131
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,500
我一直找到了六月(复活节在三月)
The answer, by the way: June.

132
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,400
小傻瓜 很抱歉 我真希望
Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I wish there was something

133
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
我可以做些什么让你好受点
I could do to make you feel better.

134
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,030
我也希望 但没有
I do, too, but there's not.

135
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,460
真的吗? 你确定?
Really? Are you sure about that?

136
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,330
也是 优加的学生怎么会错呢?
Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student?

137
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,460
嗯...
Mmm...

138
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,930
提醒你一下... 我会往右
Just warning you... I'm gonna go right.

139
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,700
别小题大作啊
Don't make a big deal out of it.

140
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
真的有必要化妆吗?
Is makeup really necessary?

141
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,330
别人看你的个人页面时
Well, when someone looks at your dating profile,

142
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,960
看的第一样东西就是你的照片
the first thing they see is your picture.

143
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,830
我想让你看起来风趣
I just want to make sure you look fun

144
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,700
充满活力 而不要
and full of life and not like a body

145
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,200
像一具刚从河里捞上来的尸体
they just pulled out of the river.

146
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,200
好吧 开始了...
All right, here we go, and...

147
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,260
微笑
smile.

148
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,830
好吧 呃... 这张备用
Okay, uh-uh, that one's in the bank.

149
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,860
这样如何?
How about this?

150
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,300
转过身 然后回眸看镜头
Turn away, and then turn back into it.

151
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,930
你想象一下
But when you do,

152
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,860
相机就是你想约的女孩
imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.

153
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,700
没问题
You got it.

154
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,060
好吧 呃
Okay, uh,

155
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,700
我们再试一次
let's try it again.

156
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,530
但这次 假装你想约的女孩
Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet

157
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,400
不想伤害你
doesn't want to hurt you.

158
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,860
我觉得我做不出来
I don't think I can give you that.

159
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,530
拜托 再拍一次
Come on. One more time.

160
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,030
呃 有点 有点模糊了
Yeah, it's... it's a little blurry,

161
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,400
不过糊点更好
but I think that works in your favor.

162
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,700
想喝酒吗?
Do you want a beer?

163
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,300
好啊
Sure.

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,360
你的档案写完了吗?
Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?

165
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,860
快了
Almost.

166
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,060
你是怎么用
Oh, what did you put

167
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,960
一个词描述自己的?
as the one-word description of yourself?

168
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,460
我写的是 无可非议
I put: unobjectionable.

169
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,200
但现在听起来
But now that I hear it out loud,

170
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,460
好像显得我有点自大了
it just seems like I'm being cocky.

171
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,460
最大优点那一栏你填的是什么?
What did you put for your best feature?

172
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,000
爸妈有钱
My parents' money.

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,100
那你是怎么填的?
Uh, what did you put for your best feature?

174
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,100
我写的: 不适用
I put: not applicable.

175
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,460
拜托 哥们 别对自己这么苛刻
Come on, dude, you're being too hard on yourself.

176
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,460
你有很多好东西的
You've got a lot of good stuff going on.

177
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,930
是吗? 比如?
Really? Like what?

178
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,500
说起来 你是... 你是出色的艺术家
Well, okay, you're a... you're a talented artist,

179
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
你有自己的生意
you own your own business.

180
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,330
但这些从没帮我找到过女人
Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.

181
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,100
好吧 我们能暗示
Okay, well, can we imply

182
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,460
你命根子大吗?
that you're well-endowed?

183
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,730
我确实有一个出奇长的睾丸
I do have one oddly long testicle.

184
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,000
人生赢家啊!
Okay, now you're talking like a winner!

185
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,230
干嘛呢?
Whatcha doin'?

186
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,830
哦 我发现Amy最爱的傲慢与偏见
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved Pride and Prejudice

187
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,160
是本完美无瑕的杰作
is a flawless masterpiece.

188
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,700
他太过骄傲
He's got too much pride,

189
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,660
她有很多偏见... 非常理所应当
she's got too much prejudice... it just works.

190
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,500
你打算在休闲版找点东西
So you're looking to ruin something for her

191
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,830
毁给她看?
in the funny pages?

192
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,600
Amy非常喜欢四格漫画马默杜克
Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,300
嗯 然后呢...?
Mm-hmm. And...?

194
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,860
我觉得找到了 你想
And I think I've got it. Consider:

195
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,960
一家人有这么大一只狗
a family possesses a dog that is so large

196
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,700
而且不服管教 他除了捣乱什么都不会
and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems.

197
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,460
他们干嘛还养他?!
Why do they keep him?!

198
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,230
或许它还小的时候很受宠爱
Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy

199
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,300
他们也不知道他会变得这么大
and didn't know how big he was gonna be.

200
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,000
确实是
Of course.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,060
你说 她怎么不喜欢Ziggy漫画呢?
You know, why couldn't she just like Ziggy?

202
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,200
为什么?
Yeah?

203
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,160
那剧情到处都是硬伤
That thing's riddled with plot holes.

204
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,860
- 抱歉 小伙伴  - 哦!
- Sorry, buddy.  - Ooh!

205
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,760
我记得她也是加菲猫的粉丝
I think she's a fan of Garfield as well.

206
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,700
哦 该死 现在我也是了
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

207
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,060
一会儿见
I'll see you later.

208
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,860
我要和Penny去看讨厌的足球赛
I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.

209
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,600
慢着... 别急
Wait... hang on.

210
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,000
你和Amy相处过
You've spent time with Amy.

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,700
你能想到任何她喜欢的东西
Can you think of anything she's fond of

212
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,530
有一堆她没注意到的缺点吗?
that has a bunch of flaws she hasn't noticed?

213
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,530
{\an8}(那不就是sheldon么)

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,560
我得走了
I gotta go.

215
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,330
准备好了吗?
You ready to go?

216
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,560
是的 这次你不用
Yep. Hey, and maybe this time

217
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,360
费心跟他们聊运动了
you don't try and talk sports with the guys.

218
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,160
那可是运动酒吧
Some sports bar.

219
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
就像他们从没听说过魁地奇似的(哈利波特中的魔法运动)
It's like they never even heard of Quidditch.

220
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,530
我们真的非去不可吗?
Do we really have to go?

221
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,930
拜托 每次我们要出去
Oh, come on. Every time we're about

222
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,560
和我朋友玩的时候 你都不想去
to hang out with my friends, you don't want to.

223
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,760
什么"太吵了"
It's like, "It's too loud,"

224
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,660
或者"厕所太脏了"
or "the bathroom's too dirty,"

225
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,160
还有"他们把鸡翅放我耳朵里了" 之类的...
or "they put a chicken wing in my ear..." I mean...

226
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,060
好吧 你... 你说得对
Well, you're... you're right.

227
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
去就去吧
Let's just go.

228
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,700
嘿 你到底怎么了?
Hey, what's going on with you?

229
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,560
没事 挺好的
Nothing, I'm fine.

230
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,160
好吧 慢着
All right, hang on.

231
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,660
还是因为你妈妈的书吗?
is this still about your mom's book?

232
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,430
不 不是所有事都是因为我妈
No. Not everything is about my mom.

233
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,700
因为如果你还为那事沮丧
'Cause if you're still upset about that,

234
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,800
我们可以不去的
we don't have to go.

235
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,630
不过这次完全是因为我妈
Except this is totally about my mom.

236
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,030
对不起
I'm so sorry.

237
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,300
我就不应该读那本书
I never should have read that book.

238
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,630
那我们出去吃个晚餐
You know what? You want to just get dinner

239
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,730
回来在电视上看比赛怎么样?
and watch the game here?

240
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,760
- 这主意还不错  - 好吧
- That sounds nice.  - Yeah. Okay.

241
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,730
或者我们可以叫点外卖
Or, you know, we could get take-out

242
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,000
然后看蓝光版未删减版
and watch the Blu-ray extended version

243
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,560
有导演解说音轨的"霍比特人"
of The Hobbit movie with commentary track.

244
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,730
谁让我妈这么伤我心呢
On account of how sad I am about my mom.

245
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:32,600
Leonard 去吃午饭啊?
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

246
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,630
马上!
One sec!

247
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,730
不好意思
Hey. Sorry.

248
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,630
嗨 Penny
Hi, Penny.

249
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,630
嗨
Hi.

250
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,700
好了 亲爱的
All right, sweetie.

251
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,160
在这好好干活
You hang in there today.

252
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,900
我尽量 但可能晚上我又会伤心了
I'll try, but I might be sad again tonight.

253
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,400
好吧
Okay.

254
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,230
哇呜!
Wow!

255
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,430
办公室嘿咻?!
Sex at work?!

256
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,460
别这么说
Leave it alone.

257
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,460
她是我女朋友
That's my girlfriend.

258
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,500
抱歉
Sorry.

259
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,800
我女朋友在办公室里和我嘿咻了!
Who just had sex with me at work!

260
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,660
你是怎么做到的?
Damn. How'd you swing that?

261
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,960
只要我一说我老妈对我多糟
Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was,

262
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,060
Penny就会想方设法想要安慰我
Penny will do anything to make me feel better.

263
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,460
- 真的啊?  - 我是说...
- Seriously?  - Look, I mean...

264
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,560
这么做不太光彩 但很管用啊
I'm not proud of it, but it does work.

265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,700
她... 她竟然陪我看了
I... I got her to watch

266
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,760
全套六部"巨蟒剧团"的纪录片
a six-part documentary on Monty Python.

267
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,630
我都不想看了 但是我还是坚持
Even I was bored, I just wanted to see

268
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,030
想试试她能不能撑到最后
if she'd make it to the end.

269
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,300
你很自豪嘛
You sound kind of proud of it.

270
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,230
对 我真的很自豪
I am, I'm really proud.

271
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,760
嗯
Yeah.

272
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,700
嗨 Sheldon
Hello, Sheldon.

273
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
你还好吗?
Is everything okay?

274
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
嗯
Yes.

275
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,830
怎么了?
Why?

276
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,030
上一次你突然即兴
Well, the last time you made

277
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,230
跟我视频的时候
an unscheduled video-chat,

278
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,260
是你在一包直薯条里发现了一根弯的
there was a curly fry in your regular fries

279
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,830
你以为是有人给你下了药
and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.

280
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,100
四月13日...
April 13...

281
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,060
月黑风高的夜晚
a dark night, indeed.

282
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,760
那这次有什么事?
So what can I do for you?

283
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,930
我是想跟你说
I'm calling to invite you

284
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,700
明天晚上我们约会吧
to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.

285
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,600
真的?
Really?

286
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,900
嗯
Yes.

287
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,330
你都陪我看
You were kind enough

288
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,060
"夺宝奇兵"了
to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me.

289
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,560
所以我也想请你
So I'd like to return the favor

290
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,460
看一集你最喜欢的
by inviting you to watch an episode

291
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,300
儿童电视剧
of your favorite childhood television series,

292
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,360
"大草原上的小家"(作者维尔德)
Little House on the Prairie.

293
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,630
听起来不错
That sounds lovely.

294
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,630
你为什么摩拳擦掌的?
Why are you rubbing your hands together?

295
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,230
额...
Um...

296
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,360
我在擦护手霜
I'm putting on lotion.

297
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,860
你到底来不来?
Are you in or not?

298
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,530
当然去了
Of course I'm in.

299
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,800
太好了
Excellent.

300
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,660
那我们就明天见了
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

301
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,900
晚安 Fowler博士
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

302
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,460
晚安 Cooper博士
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

303
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,230
搞定了
Good night, indeed.

304
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,100
真是个土包子
What a rube.

305
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,860
我的纤纤玉手还用擦什么护手霜?
Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?

306
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,100
你晚饭的时候都没说话
You were really quiet during dinner.

307
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,060
有什么事吗?
Is everything okay?

308
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,200
嗯
Yeah.

309
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,060
我只是想起我妈妈了
I guess I was just thinking about my mom,

310
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,130
还有我那悲惨的童年
and how sad my childhood was.

311
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,560
嗯 肯定挺难熬的
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

312
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,930
我要去洗个澡 你来洗碗吧
I'm gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.

313
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,730
我们俩一起洗怎么样
How about I take a bath with you

314
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,360
说不定有惊喜喔
and see what happens.

315
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,700
你听好了
Here's what's gonna happen:

316
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
我去洗澡
I'm gonna take a bath,

317
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,060
你去洗碗
and you're gonna do the dishes.

318
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,230
就这样?
That's it?

319
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,000
不安慰安慰我?
No compassion?

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,260
啊 可怜的Howie
Aw, poor Howie.

321
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,400
行了吧? 我去洗澡了
We good? I'm gonna take a bath.

322
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Bernie啊...
Bernie...

323
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,560
天啊 你这是哪根筋不对?
God, what is going on with you?

324
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,630
我在倾诉我的苦痛呢
I'm sharing my pain.

325
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,860
我不买账 重来
And I'm not buying it. Try again.

326
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,330
我在一个迷失的文化中
I'm learning to be a man in a culture

327
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,000
艰难成长为一个男人...?
where it's increasingly difficult to know how...?

328
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,930
最后一次机会
Strike two.

329
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,030
我跟Leonard学得
I'm copying Leonard.

330
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,260
他每次跟Penny一装可怜
When he does this to Penny,

331
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,330
他们就滚床单 还看"巨蟒剧团"
they have sex and watch Monty Python.

332
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,530
- Howard!  - 我知道
- Howard!  - I know.

333
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,530
这很傻
It was dumb,

334
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,560
我不该这样
I shouldn't have done it.

335
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,030
我觉得自己很悲哀...
And it's making me feel sad...

336
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,300
太悲哀了
So sad.

337
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,230
你还是去洗澡吧 我去刷碗了
You know, why don't you take a bath? I'll do the dishes.

338
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,830
三 二 一...
Three, two, one...

339
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,100
搞定了
That's it.

340
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,800
我们的交友网站头像传好了
Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.

341
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,760
各位客官注意了:
Attention all shoppers:

342
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,400
本店正式开张营业!
my business is open for business!

343
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,060
放马过来吧 姑娘们
That's right, ladies.

344
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,760
可要知道
For all you know,

345
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,960
我浑身散发着自信幽默的气息喔
I'm confident and fun to be around.

346
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,800
不错啊 每次有人看
Oh, cool, it tells you

347
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,530
你的主页都会有提醒
when someone's reading your profile.

348
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,600
这个叫"Jenny309"
"Jenny309."

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,360
希望后边的数字不是她的体重
I hope that's not her weight.

350
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
如果是的话... 把她让给我
If it is, I'll... I'll take her.

351
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,960
好样的
Good one.

352
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,860
哦 也有人看我的了
Ooh, I got one, too.

353
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,930
姑娘们自己送上门来啊
The ladies are coming to us.

354
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,900
老天爷 要是我早几年开始玩这个
Oh, man, if I'd started this years ago,

355
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,400
到现在可能都已经离了两三次婚了
I'd be divorced two or three times by now.

356
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,900
什么... ? 又来一个
What... ? Another one.

357
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
你觉得不 怪... 怪怪的
You know, it... it's weird.

358
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,430
她们读你资料的时候 你...
When they're reading your profile, does it...

359
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,060
你觉不觉得没有安全感?
does it make you feel exposed?

360
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,130
就好像她们看到你全裸一样?
Like they see you naked?

361
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,430
她们又没尖叫着逃跑 所以 不觉得吧
Well, they're not running away screaming, so, no.

362
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,730
我爱死"大草原之家"了
I love Little House.

363
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,060
让我特别向往住在农场
It made me want to live on a farm so much

364
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,700
我还试着给我的猫挤过奶
I tried to milk my cat.

365
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,600
挤出的小小一碗臭糊糊
That tangy bowl of Cheerios

366
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,860
真不值得我被抓之后缝的那几针
was not worth the stitches.

367
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,360
你坐好 放轻松
Well, you sit back, relax

368
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,800
尽享回到童年的快乐之旅吧
and enjoy a beloved childhood memory.

369
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,160
看见那边那座小屋没?
You see that cabin there?

370
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,360
他们是私自占用印第安人的土地
I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land.

371
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,400
是啊
Yeah.

372
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,660
个人认为 我们对印第安原住民的
Personally, I think what we did

373
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,000
所作所为大错特错
to the Native Americans was wrong,

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,600
但这毕竟是你最爱的片子 不是我的
but this is your favorite show, not mine.

375
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,760
看看小萝拉·英格斯
Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,

376
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,230
吃着那块花生黄油三明治
eating that peanut butter sandwich.

377
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,760
花生黄油?!
Peanut butter?!

378
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,560
嗬!
Huh!

379
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,830
这就怪了 因为花生黄油
That's strange, since peanut butter

380
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,630
直到上世纪初才问世
wasn't introduced until the early 1900s.

381
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,330
我要是事先知道这是部穿越剧
If I knew this show was about time travel,

382
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,100
我早就来看了
I would have watched it much sooner.

383
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,100
你在报复我
You're trying to get back at me

384
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,130
就为了我对"夺宝奇兵"的评价
for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.

385
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,730
胡扯 怎么可能
That's silly.

386
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:06,700
简直跟贝克医生拥有电话这件事一样胡扯
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone,

387
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,130
因为那个时期
since telephones only existed

388
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,960
电话只在大城市里才有
in large cities at that time.

389
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,460
这倒更像是部"大荒诞之家"
This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.

390
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,200
Sheldon 我们在谈恋爱
Sheldon, we're in a relationship.

391
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,330
你生气的时候 要跟我直说
When you get angry, just tell me.

392
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,500
没必要以牙还牙地报复
You don't need to seek revenge.

393
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,060
真的吗?
Are you sure?

394
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,900
每次我爸彻夜不归的时候
Every time my dad stayed out all night,

395
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,300
妈妈都会把仓鼠屎偷偷混进他的口嚼烟草里面
my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.

396
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,860
不管 反正咱们之间不是这样的
Well, that's not how we're going to do it.

397
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,060
好吧
Fine.

398
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,500
我很生你的气
I'm mad at you.

399
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,960
不光是因为你毁了我的"夺宝奇兵"
Not only did you ruin Raiders for me,

400
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,860
你甚至毁了整个系列
you may have ruined the whole franchise.

401
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,930
除了第四部
Except for the fourth one,

402
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:46,100
那部自己就已经够糟的了
which was bad before you got your mitts on it.

403
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,060
我... 我当时不该那么说的
I... I shouldn't have said it.

404
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
我道歉
I'm sorry.

405
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,000
谢谢你
Thank you.

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,330
感觉好点了吗?
Do you feel better?

407
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,000
嗯
Yes.

408
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,530
但如果我告诉你这个之后我会更开心的 
But not as good as I'm going to when I tell you

409
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,760
你亲爱的加菲猫根本没道理讨厌周一
that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays.

410
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,200
他是只猫 他又不用上班
He's a cat. He doesn't have a job.

411
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,430
嘿 我刚刚... 什么情况?
Hey, I was just... what is happening?

412
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,500
噢 就是犒劳你一下
Oh, just a little treat.

413
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,160
我知道最近一提到你妈
I know you've been feeling really bad

414
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,600
你就很难过
about your mom lately.

415
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,460
哦 我是很难过
Oh, oh, I have.

416
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,060
悲痛欲绝
So bad.

417
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
我想让你高兴高兴
And I wanted to make you feel better,

418
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,230
所以我为你准备了惊喜大礼包
so I planned something very special for you.

419
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,230
嗯哼
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

420
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,030
我已经惊喜得有反应了
I can already feel it working.

421
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:32,600
你好 Leonard
Hello, Leonard.

422
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,530
妈?!
Mom?!

423
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:40,030
我听说你最近为了在情感上控制你的女友
I understand you have been whining about my parenting

424
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,600
一直对我的抚养方式哭哭啼啼 抱怨个不停
in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend.

425
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,500
我... 呃...
I... uh...

426
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,860
Bernadette都告诉我了
Bernadette told me everything.

427
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,800
现在你左边右边哪边都甭想要了
Now you don't get the left or the right.

428
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,700
咱们来探讨一下
Let's discuss

429
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,730
你为何依然将我
why you continue to involve me

430
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,130
扯进你的性生活
in your sex life.

431
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,330
别了 求你了 妈妈
Oh, please, Mommy.

432
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,930
别了 妈妈
No, Mommy.

433
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,230
你六岁那年
When you were six years old,

434
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,060
走进房间 撞见我跟你爸一丝不挂
you walked in on me and your father naked.

435
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,860
我当时正用你新买的乒乓球拍
I was swatting his bottom

436
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,000
拍打他的屁股
with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.

437
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,130
原来我当时不是在做梦?
I didn't dream that?

438
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,960
你当时感觉如何?
How did that make you feel?

439
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,660
Penny 快回来!
Penny, come back!

440
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,160
我现在是真的难过了!
I'm sad for real now!

441
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,160
在过去两小时当中
In the last two hours,

442
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,760
有162个女人看了我们的资料
162 women have read our profiles.

443
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,560
多少人给咱们留言了?
How many of them have sent us messages?

444
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,960
- 加起来?  - 嗯
- Combined?  - Yes.

445
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,030
零个
Zero.

446
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,130
老兄 这... 这简直太残忍了
Dude, this is... this is brutal.

447
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,230
我以前从没受过这样的气
I don't think I've ever felt so rejected.

448
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,960
我可是救助过一只狗
And I had a rescue dog

449
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,360
那狗却跑走了的人啊
who ran back to the pound.

450
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,260
简直不可能更糟了
This is the worst.

451
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,330
要是咱们想被放倒
If we're gonna get shot down,

452
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,730
还不如跟以前一样
we might as well just go to a bar

453
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,900
直接去酒吧
and do it old school.

454
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,130
直视她们 看她还好意思拒绝
And make them look us in the eye.

455
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,700
就是 怎么都比这样强
Yeah, anything is better than this.

456
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
你好啊
Hello.

457
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,500
对你没兴趣
Not interested.

458
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,300
我错了 这样更糟
I was wrong. This is worse.

459
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,660
等等... 要不是因为印第安纳·琼斯
Wait, wait... if it wasn't for Indiana Jones,

460
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,760
约柜怎么会出现在仓库!
the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse!

461
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,700
没错儿!
That's true!

462
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,800
是他带上约柜
He collected and delivered the ark

463
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
交给当局保管的
to the proper authorities for filing.

464
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,700
大英雄啊!
Like a hero!

465
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,760
就是! 说得好!
Yeah! Yes! Right!

466
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,730
不过 理论上讲
Although, technically,

467
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,260
他本来应该把约柜
Indy was supposed to take the ark

468
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,500
带到一座博物馆给人研究的
to a museum to be studied.

469
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,260
可他连这种小事都没做到
He couldn't even get that done.

470
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,160
噢...
Aw...
