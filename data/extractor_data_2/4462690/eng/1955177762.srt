00:00:00,045 --> 00:00:02,172
<i>Previously on Better Call Saul...</i>

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:06,396
- Tommy, about the electricity.
- I know how it sounds but it's real.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,461
I'm picking up that driver.
And if he knows you, that's bad.

4
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:11,221
The cops keeping it out of the papers.

5
00:00:11,448 --> 00:00:13,592
He wanted to put the cops onto Hector.

6
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:16,385
- He forgot all about you.
- I haven't forgotten him.

7
00:00:16,455 --> 00:00:19,095
1216 Rosella Drive, Scottsdale, Arizona.

8
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:20,427
This was no mistake.

9
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,619
He sabotaged me.

10
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:24,290
Remember me? The answer is no.

11
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:27,284
I know he was here. I know what he did.

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,872
Father Brady's in the chapel.

13
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:49,911
Just push the call button
if you want to see him.

14
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:04,651
When was the last time you ate?

15
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:06,510
What?

16
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:07,211
Food.

17
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:08,850
Have you had any lately?

18
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,821
I'm fine.

19
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,965
Come on, Chuck, let's go over to Novi's

20
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:17,991
and stretch our legs, get
some air, couple of hoagies.

21
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:21,077
You want to get a sandwich? Now?

22
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:23,295
Just a thought.

23
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:38,544
Remember that time I accidentally invited

24
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:42,945
Kathy and Cheryl to Mom's surprise party?

25
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:46,215
It was, kind of, tricky
out on the dance floor.

26
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,353
It was a fun night.

27
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:52,124
I just remember the whole
family cleaning up after you.

28
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:55,164
And Mom leaving her own birthday party

29
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,665
to drive one of them home.

30
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:06,299
Seriously, Chuck, we gotta eat.

31
00:02:06,857 --> 00:02:08,356
Mom'll be okay for a few minutes.

32
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:10,592
It's been three days.
It could be three more.

33
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:11,893
Okay?

34
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,194
Let's go, buddy.

35
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,364
Jimmy, you want to eat, go eat.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,832
I'll bring you something...

37
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:22,771
um, roast beef, no tomato,
Italian on the side.

38
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:23,938
All right?

39
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:25,473
'Kay. Be right back.

40
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:14,923
Mom?

41
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,758
Mom?

42
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:21,763
Jimmy.

43
00:03:21,798 --> 00:03:24,165
No, Mom, it's me... Chuck.

44
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:29,270
Jimmy.

45
00:03:29,306 --> 00:03:31,139
No, Mom, it's m...

46
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,699
So this is it, then?

47
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,367
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:01,903
She has that DNR.

49
00:04:03,173 --> 00:04:05,340
Is your brother in the building?

50
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,608
We can use the intercom.

51
00:04:06,643 --> 00:04:08,309
No.

52
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:26,961
Charles... is there anyone
you want us to call?

53
00:04:53,256 --> 00:04:55,089
H-Hey.

54
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,257
Hey.

55
00:04:58,862 --> 00:04:59,828
Chuck.

56
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,396
Hey, Chuck.

57
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:04,165
Chuck, where's Mom? What happened?

58
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:05,400
She's gone.

59
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:08,670
What? W-When?

60
00:05:08,705 --> 00:05:11,673
How did...

61
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:23,418
Did she wake up? Did she say anything?

62
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:29,324
No.

Call 911.

65
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,665
Call 911!

66
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,567
Ernie, get out here!

67
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,903
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

68
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:14,904
- Hey!
- Come back tomorrow.

69
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:16,372
It'll be half the price.

70
00:06:18,109 --> 00:06:19,208
Yeah, I need an ambulance.

71
00:06:19,244 --> 00:06:21,077
I got paper towels. Good.

72
00:06:21,112 --> 00:06:22,879
A guy came in, and now there's blood, uh...

73
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:27,183
Um, yeah, hold on. Hold on one second.

74
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,185
Chuck. Come on. Come on.

75
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,388
Chuck. Hey, hey, hey.

76
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:34,390
- Hey, Chuck, with us, buddy?
- The copy center.

77
00:06:34,425 --> 00:06:35,391
Chuck.

78
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:36,793
615 Gold.

79
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:38,194
Buddy, y-you okay?

80
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,396
No, he doesn't look blue.

81
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:42,064
Hey.

82
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,467
- We're gonna get you to the hospital, okay?
- Lance.

83
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:45,635
Everything will be all right.

84
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,836
I work here.

85
00:06:57,282 --> 00:06:58,214
Hang tight, Charles.

86
00:06:58,249 --> 00:06:59,482
We're almost there.

87
00:07:03,688 --> 00:07:05,755
Watch yourself.

88
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,862
Coming through.

89
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,936
On 3. 1, 2, 3.

90
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:21,304
Transferring.

91
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,807
Okay.

92
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,343
This is Charles McGill, late 50s.

93
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:29,846
He had a syncopal episode at a print shop,

94
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:31,914
witnessed by an employee.

95
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,650
Estimated loss of consciousness
was one minute.

96
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,519
His vitals are stable.

97
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:38,354
He's got a laceration on his forehead

98
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:40,957
that appears to need suturing.

99
00:07:40,992 --> 00:07:42,158
Charles, how you doing tonight?

100
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:43,326
Can you talk to me?

101
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:44,694
Seizure activity?

102
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,596
Not in transfer and none reported.

103
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,497
No urinary incontinence.

104
00:07:48,533 --> 00:07:50,099
Do we have any family members?

105
00:07:50,134 --> 00:07:51,701
- There's a brother in the waiting room.
- Okay.

106
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:52,869
How much fluid did you give him?

107
00:07:52,904 --> 00:07:54,370
- Mnh.
- That's the first liter.

108
00:07:54,405 --> 00:07:56,138
- Lights.
- What's that, Charles?

109
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:57,874
Mnh, you have to turn off the lights.

110
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,476
- No, we can't do that right now, sweetie.
- Ohh! God.

111
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,944
- You fell and hit your head.
- Mnh.

112
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,112
We're gonna need to do some tests, okay?

113
00:08:03,147 --> 00:08:04,313
- No.
- We can't...

114
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:06,084
- We need the lights on to help you.
- No.

115
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,207
Charles, can you squeeze
my hand really hard?

116
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:10,553
Turn the lights...

117
00:08:10,588 --> 00:08:12,288
Mnh. What is that?

118
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:14,023
Okay, we're just checking
your oxygen there, Charles.

119
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:15,157
- Ow!
- Do you have any allergies?

120
00:08:15,193 --> 00:08:16,292
No.

121
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,393
Are you on any medications?

122
00:08:17,428 --> 00:08:19,128
Ohh, no. Mnh.

123
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:20,963
Okay. I'm gonna move your arms and legs,

124
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,565
- and you tell me if there's any pain, okay?
- Ow.

125
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,567
- Can we get an EKG?
- What? To what?

126
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,068
Gentlemen, did we get an EKG?

127
00:08:26,104 --> 00:08:27,904
- What?
- He's on a five-lead now.

128
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:29,927
- Okay. We didn't get a 12-lead.
- No.

129
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:30,995
Okay, Tricia, we're gonna
need a 12-lead, please.

130
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,643
No EKG! No EKG!

131
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,211
Yes, Charles, we need to do o EKG okay?

132
00:08:35,246 --> 00:08:36,646
- No, you don't understand.
- Charles.

133
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,014
- I have a condition!
- Charles, we need...

134
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:40,483
I have a hypersensitivity to electricity!

135
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,435
Okay, but you need to lie still...

136
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:42,351
Charles, please push your
feet against my hands.

137
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,420
- so we examine your head and your neck...
- Very good.

138
00:08:44,455 --> 00:08:46,155
- make sure your heart's all right, okay?
- Get these out of here.

139
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,157
- No, you can't touch this.
- No, I... I have a condition.

140
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:49,892
- Tricia, can I get a light?
- I did not give you my consent.

141
00:08:49,928 --> 00:08:51,861
- You can't touch that.
- You have no right to do this!

142
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:54,530
- We need to monitor your heart, okay?
- Get these out of here!

143
00:08:54,565 --> 00:08:56,065
- Charles.
- Just relax.

144
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,366
- The lights, please.
- Just relax.

145
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,668
Please stay calm, Charles.

146
00:08:58,703 --> 00:09:00,002
Ohhh!

147
00:09:00,038 --> 00:09:01,370
Charles, you need to cooperate with us.

148
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,705
This is gonna be very easy.

149
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,707
We're just gonna draw a little bit of blood,

150
00:09:04,742 --> 00:09:06,776
suture up your wound,
and do a very simple CAT scan.

151
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:08,511
- No! No CAT scan!
- Okay, c-calm, calm.

152
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:09,630
No CAT scan!

153
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,713
Tricia, can we please get some restraints?

154
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:12,715
- You don't understand!
- Gentlemen, please come in here.

155
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,183
- Please, turn off the lights.
- You have to hold him down, restrain him.

156
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,584
- Please turn off the lights!
- Charles...

157
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,953
- Right here...
- We need you to calm down.

158
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:18,754
- You're killing me!
- Calm down, Charles.

159
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,756
Just gonna get them
and figure it out for you.

160
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:22,525
We got you.

161
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,893
Just keep your head down.

162
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:47,450
How's he doing?

163
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:48,918
I'd love to be able to tell you,

164
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:51,487
but we can't know for sure
until we do those tests.

165
00:09:54,492 --> 00:09:55,791
You know what I'm gonna say.

166
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:57,059
Why can't you just go old-school...

167
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,327
you know, look at his pupils,

168
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,929
use a stethoscope... that kinda thing?

169
00:09:59,964 --> 00:10:01,097
He doesn't want to be here.

170
00:10:01,132 --> 00:10:02,765
What he wants and what he needs

171
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,301
are two very different things, Jimmy.

172
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:07,236
We don't know if he lost consciousness

173
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:10,973
because of a heart-related issue
or if it was a mild stroke.

174
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:13,309
We don't know if his spine has been injured

175
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:14,643
if his brain is swelling.

176
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,679
He likely has a concussion, at least.

177
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:19,081
Chuck is once again refusing these tests

178
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:22,351
because they involve being
bombarded by electricity...

179
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:24,687
his words.

180
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:27,356
Nothing has changed since
the last time he was in here.

181
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,826
Look, I don't know how to
explain this any clearer.

182
00:10:30,862 --> 00:10:32,862
I'm not committing him.

183
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:41,437
What about a Temporary
Emergency Guardianship?

184
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:43,606
I mean, he fits the parameters.

185
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:44,874
You're telling me

186
00:10:44,909 --> 00:10:46,509
he's in need of medical care so urgent

187
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:48,711
that we can't wait around
on court procedure.

188
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:49,845
- Most certainly.
- Yeah.

189
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,548
And Chuck is not able to
understand the consequences.

190
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,517
I mean, he can understand them, but he...

191
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:55,651
Absolutely.

192
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,053
A judge will see it that way, too.

193
00:10:57,088 --> 00:10:59,188
And then I take him home, and it's over.

194
00:10:59,223 --> 00:11:02,725
Pending results and proper treatment, yes.

195
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:07,063
I know a judge we can call right now.

196
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,270
Let me be the one to tell him.

197
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,428
Hey, buddy. How's it going?

198
00:11:41,432 --> 00:11:43,365
Chuck.

199
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:46,769
Well, if it isn't Johnny-on-the-spot.

200
00:11:46,804 --> 00:11:48,537
What? What does that mean?

201
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,606
Is Ernesto out there?

202
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,408
Yeah. Can I get you something?

203
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,742
Ernesto!

204
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:54,710
Come in here, please!

205
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:56,045
Look, just take it easy.

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,681
Ernesto!

207
00:12:00,751 --> 00:12:02,384
Just put your stuff in there.

208
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:09,058
I got him.

209
00:12:09,093 --> 00:12:10,526
How are you feeling', Mr. McGill?

210
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:12,561
Ernesto, how long was I unconscious

211
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:13,696
in that print shop?

212
00:12:13,731 --> 00:12:14,964
I'm not sure.

213
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,399
30 seconds, a minute?

214
00:12:17,435 --> 00:12:19,368
- 2 minutes?
- I'd say maybe about a minute.

215
00:12:19,403 --> 00:12:20,536
You were kinda in and out.

216
00:12:20,571 --> 00:12:22,138
And how long was I lying on the floor

217
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,939
before the ambulance arrived?

218
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:26,942
About 10 minutes, I think,
t I didn't look at the clock.

219
00:12:26,978 --> 00:12:30,813
And yet, you were there.

220
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,215
Chuck, can we, uh...

221
00:12:33,251 --> 00:12:34,817
There's only one way

222
00:12:34,852 --> 00:12:36,919
you could have gotten there so quickly...

223
00:12:36,954 --> 00:12:38,254
you never left.

224
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:40,322
I think you're getting all wound up.

225
00:12:40,358 --> 00:12:41,891
Can you just take a few deep br...

226
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:43,292
You bribed him...

227
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:44,326
that kid behind the counter.

228
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:45,761
What?

229
00:12:45,796 --> 00:12:47,997
Between the time Ernesto left and I arrived,

230
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,665
you paid that half-wit to swear

231
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,100
- he'd never laid eyes on you.
- Mr. McGill.

232
00:12:51,135 --> 00:12:53,636
And then you stuck around to watch.

233
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:55,938
Why? Just wanted to see me suffer?

234
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:57,406
- Hmm?
- Mr. McGill.

235
00:12:57,441 --> 00:12:58,574
Just wanted to have a laugh at my expense?

236
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,109
I called him.

237
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,412
What?

238
00:13:03,447 --> 00:13:05,581
I called Jimmy earlier,
before I picked you up.

239
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:08,584
He showed up when he did
because I called him.

240
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,420
I was worried about you, and I just...

241
00:13:11,455 --> 00:13:12,922
I called him.

242
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:14,456
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:22,531
Get out... Both of you.

244
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:38,480
Chuck, there's something that I have to do,

245
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:41,116
and I'm really sorry...

246
00:13:41,152 --> 00:13:42,484
Really, truly sorry,

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,221
but I gotta do it, and it's for you.

248
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:47,723
You're trying to have me committed.

249
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,625
No, it's a Temporary...

250
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,894
Temporary Emergency Guardianship...

251
00:13:51,929 --> 00:13:54,230
to-may-to, to-mah-to.

252
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:57,766
Well, you've finally
got me where you want me.

253
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,053
Hey, you look beat.

254
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:20,422
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

255
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,057
I'm fine to hang out, you know?

256
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,058
Whatever you need.

257
00:14:23,094 --> 00:14:24,860
Nah. We're good here.

258
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:28,197
Hey, Ernie.

259
00:14:28,232 --> 00:14:32,768
Uh, how come you said that about calling' me?

260
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,203
I don't know, man.

261
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:36,572
Look, I didn't want to say anything,

262
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:38,107
but your brother...

263
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:40,009
the way he's been
talking' about you lately...

264
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:44,179
it's like... He's really
out to get you, Jimmy.

265
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:47,249
And... I don't know.

266
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,451
You're my friend.

267
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,389
Thanks.

268
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,061
I'll call you tomorrow.

269
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:03,132
I miss the mailroom.

270
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,365
Are you familiar with the Hippocratic oath?

271
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,867
You should be.

272
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:50,170
One of the oldest
binding documents in history.

273
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:53,173
Primum non nocere... First, do no harm.

274
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,509
This is not the way to treat my condition.

275
00:16:55,544 --> 00:16:58,678
It's as though I had a...
an allergy to penicillin,

276
00:16:58,714 --> 00:17:01,848
and yet, you persist on treating
my infection with it.

277
00:17:01,884 --> 00:17:04,151
I appreciate the analogy, Charles,

278
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:07,053
but I don't think it quite fits.

279
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,789
Look, we'll have you in and out of Radiology

280
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:10,791
before you know it, all right?

281
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,793
Then we can see about
getting that neck collar off

282
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:13,827
and get you moving around.

283
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:26,339
Okay, Charles, the scan is starting now.

284
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,575
The table that you're on is going to move.

285
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,911
You're gonna hear a sound
that might seem loud to you,

286
00:17:30,946 --> 00:17:33,513
but it's nothing to worry about.

287
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:23,305
Still no word?

288
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:24,306
Jesus.

289
00:18:24,342 --> 00:18:26,942
How long is this gonna take?

290
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:29,945
She said that whole test
would be like 10 minutes.

291
00:18:29,981 --> 00:18:31,780
Maybe they had to start over.

292
00:18:31,816 --> 00:18:35,618
What... 20 times?

293
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:37,586
He should be home.

294
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:40,823
Jimmy, you're doing' the right thing.

295
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,563
Would you get your work out, please?

296
00:18:47,598 --> 00:18:50,165
Because God knows how much
longer we're gonna be here.

297
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,167
I'd feel better if you were doing something,

298
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:54,603
you know, unhospital-y.

299
00:18:54,639 --> 00:18:57,006
Unhospital-y.

300
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,874
I'm on it.

301
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:11,520
You know what?

302
00:19:11,555 --> 00:19:14,757
- I'm gonna go ask for an update.
- Okay. Good idea.

303
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:16,959
You are the greatest generation.

304
00:19:16,994 --> 00:19:18,260
- Jimmy.
- What?

305
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,862
You didn't start World War II,

306
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:22,031
but you sure as heck finished it.

307
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:23,699
And if that weren't enough,

308
00:19:23,734 --> 00:19:27,503
you sent a rocket 300 feet tall to the moon.

309
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:29,705
Now, in your golden years,

310
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,207
you need someone looking out for you,

311
00:19:32,243 --> 00:19:33,642
someone you can trust,

312
00:19:33,678 --> 00:19:36,278
a man who says what he does

313
00:19:36,314 --> 00:19:38,113
and does what he says.

314
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:40,950
When you need someone to count on...

315
00:19:40,985 --> 00:19:42,885
- Gimme Jimmy!
- Gimme Jimmy!

316
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,520
Gimme Jimmy!

317
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:48,991
Because moxie is in such
short supply these days.

318
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:52,494
Jimmy McGill... A lawyer you can trust.

319
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:56,065
It's really good, Jimmy.

320
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,967
You made a really good commercial.

321
00:19:58,002 --> 00:19:59,601
Thanks.

322
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:12,715
Jimmy.

323
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,918
Oh, finally. So, how is he?

324
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,921
Well, the good news is that,
physically, he's okay.

325
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:21,357
The radiologist said everything looks normal

326
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:23,092
with Charles' head and spine,

327
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:24,927
so we took his neck collar off.

328
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,562
His head wound will heal just fine.

329
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:28,097
We gave him a tenus shot

330
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,532
because his immunization records
were not current.

331
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:31,734
I'm sure that's no surprise to you.

332
00:20:31,769 --> 00:20:32,935
And... And... And his heart?

333
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,003
Strong.

334
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:36,205
The EKG was normal.

335
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,408
As far as losing consciousness,
my best guess is

336
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,711
Charles had what's called
a stress-related syncope.

337
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:44,913
It's basically a panic attack,

338
00:20:44,949 --> 00:20:49,351
but no signs of a stroke or cardiac event.

339
00:20:49,387 --> 00:20:52,554
However, there was...

340
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,990
a complication.

341
00:20:57,595 --> 00:21:00,396
Chuck? Hey, buddy, it's me.

342
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,798
They said everything looks good,
so let's get you outta here.

343
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,933
What do you say?

344
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,576
What's wrong with him?

345
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:16,478
Whatever you gave him should've
worn off already, right?

346
00:21:16,514 --> 00:21:18,714
We watched him for several hours.

347
00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:21,083
We even gave him what's
called a reversal agent.

348
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:24,086
So, yes, the sedative wore off.

349
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,955
- This is something else.
- What?

350
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:29,591
We think it's a state
of self-induced catatonia.

351
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:31,460
"We"... always with the "we."

352
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:32,661
I think it's you.

353
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:34,763
You're the only doctor in the room.

354
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,099
I think you fried his brain
with that machine.

355
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,267
Jimmy.

356
00:21:38,302 --> 00:21:39,501
I'm sorry. This is bullshit.

357
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:40,536
Jimmy.

358
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,339
What next?

359
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:47,609
When I first treated Charles,
he was in a similar state.

360
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:48,944
Wouldn't you agree?

361
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:55,150
I have to believe
that it's just a matter of time

362
00:21:55,186 --> 00:21:56,318
before he comes out of it.

363
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:57,619
Matter of time.

364
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:02,024
Fine, then. I'll wait right here.

365
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:15,504
Shot left. 1.5 minutes.

366
00:22:18,642 --> 00:22:21,143
How many rounds've gone through the tube?

367
00:22:21,178 --> 00:22:22,978
For a 762?

368
00:22:23,013 --> 00:22:25,514
You can put 3,500 through it and never know.

369
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:27,783
It's about how tight she shoots.

370
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:30,352
And this one's tight as they come.

371
00:22:30,387 --> 00:22:34,690
I'd say there's a breeze
picking up downrange.

372
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:36,525
Your barrel gonna be cold?

373
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,661
Let's suppose so.

374
00:22:39,697 --> 00:22:41,697
Well, then, you'd better have
paid attention to that shot.

375
00:22:41,732 --> 00:22:44,733
Uh-huh. I'd better have.

376
00:22:44,768 --> 00:22:49,605
Adjusting right, 1.5 minutes.

377
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:58,213
Send it.

378
00:23:01,085 --> 00:23:02,351
Hit.

379
00:23:02,386 --> 00:23:04,853
Center hit.

380
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:10,826
I suggest you don't change up your ammo.

381
00:23:10,861 --> 00:23:13,562
Stick with the 168
grain boat-tail hollow point...

382
00:23:13,597 --> 00:23:15,998
if it's an open shot, that is.

383
00:23:16,033 --> 00:23:17,900
Now, if you got to shoot
through a heavy window,

384
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:19,735
I'll up you to a 180.

385
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,704
But as you know, you'll have
to recalculate the shot.

386
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,440
168 will do it.

387
00:23:25,476 --> 00:23:28,277
How many boxes?

388
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:29,945
Just the one.

389
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:34,550
No, it's on the house.

390
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:40,389
Uh, one last thing.

391
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,996
No offense.

392
00:23:50,067 --> 00:23:52,401
None taken.

393
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:43,193
Ohh.

394
00:24:45,163 --> 00:24:48,598
Jimmy, can I get some water?

395
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:51,768
Chuck. Hey, buddy, you're back with us.

396
00:24:51,803 --> 00:24:52,969
How you...

397
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,270
Can I get some water, please?

398
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:55,505
Yeah, yeah, water.

399
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,440
Mnh.

400
00:24:57,476 --> 00:24:59,643
Mnh.

401
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,783
Oh, shit. Sorry.

402
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,753
Want some more?

403
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:11,121
Mm.

404
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,455
Oh.

405
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:14,438
Last thing I remember

406
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:16,474
was that machine they put me in.

407
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:17,775
How long was I out for?

408
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:21,879
Was... 20 hours.

409
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:27,618
And next order of business...
get you the hell outta here.

410
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:30,154
Where to next?

411
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,790
Some insane asylum in Las Cruces?

412
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,160
Someplace you can really
tuck me away, but good?

413
00:25:36,196 --> 00:25:39,130
Home, Chuck. You're going' home.

414
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:41,299
Well, your heart's okay,

415
00:25:41,334 --> 00:25:43,534
and so is that crack on your head,

416
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,470
so that's all I wanted to know.

417
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:49,574
What about the T.E.G.?

418
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:52,677
The "T" stands for "Temporary," right?

419
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:57,882
You wanna go to bed?

420
00:25:57,917 --> 00:26:00,851
No, no. It's... It's cooler down here.

421
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:06,924
What can I get you?

422
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:10,828
I'll make you some tea...
uh, the good stuff,

423
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:12,697
not that brown water they have
at the hospital.

424
00:26:12,732 --> 00:26:15,333
I'm fine.

425
00:26:15,368 --> 00:26:16,734
I'll make you some tea.

426
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,537
Jimmy. No.

427
00:26:20,773 --> 00:26:23,274
Just...

428
00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:25,076
You've done your duty.

429
00:26:25,111 --> 00:26:26,644
You can go now.

430
00:26:28,548 --> 00:26:31,582
That came out a bit harsh.

431
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:35,219
Look, I've been zapped
and poked and prodded,

432
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:40,291
and now I just I wanna be left alone.

433
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:42,693
If things start going south for you again,

434
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:43,894
how am I even gonna know?

435
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,764
I'm fine. I promise.

436
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,868
See?

437
00:26:50,903 --> 00:26:53,604
Feeling better already.

438
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,307
I mean, I don't even have a key, so...

439
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:01,746
Can I get Ernie back here?

440
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:04,048
Would you let me do that for you, at least?

441
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,950
You need someone looking' in on ya.

442
00:27:05,985 --> 00:27:07,118
You gotta eat, right?

443
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,055
All right.

444
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:21,866
Feel better, Chuck.

445
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:10,220
Por favor!

446
00:36:05,324 --> 00:36:07,524
All right, I will get right on that.

447
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:10,468
I should have it for you by early next week.

448
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,371
You have yourself a
wonderful day, Mr. Collins.

449
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:20,978
Oh! There you go.

450
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:22,847
Yeah, get the sunglasses out.

451
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:23,981
It's very bright.

452
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,850
Gotta protect the old' peepers.

453
00:36:25,885 --> 00:36:28,652
You gotta...

454
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,188
Yep, looking sharp.

455
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:33,357
Bingo.

456
00:36:33,392 --> 00:36:35,559
Uh, bye-bye, now.

457
00:36:38,364 --> 00:36:39,830
Okay.

458
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,167
Folks, I'm sorry about the wait,

459
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,503
but the attention I give each client means

460
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:49,173
sometimes, things get a little... backed up.

461
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,875
Uh [breathes sharply] but I promise

462
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,943
to get to each and every one of you in turn.

463
00:36:52,979 --> 00:36:55,045
Mrs. DeShazo, my dear,
I believe you're next.

464
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,014
But first, may I get anybody some coffee?

465
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,849
Can I talk to you?

466
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:01,585
Uh, excuse me one second.

467
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:04,722
We have got to get a
receptionist... like, yesterday.

468
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:06,090
Jimmy, Howard just called.

469
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:08,860
He says he has been trying
to reach you all morning.

470
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,030
So? Tell him to stop bothering
you and leave me a message.

471
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,099
It's about Chuck.

472
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:16,334
It's important... That's all he'll say.

473
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:19,471
Okay.

474
00:37:19,506 --> 00:37:22,807
Unfortunately, uh, my associate tells me

475
00:37:22,843 --> 00:37:26,111
I'm needed for some brief
but pressing legal business.

476
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,947
I just need to make one quick phone call.

477
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,650
Uh, in the meantime,
who was it who wanted coffee?

478
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,356
Yeah, okay, uh, this young lady
will get you coffee...

479
00:37:38,392 --> 00:37:41,660
and, also, doughnuts if there are any left.

480
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:54,506
I want coffee, but I do not want cream.

481
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:58,076
Hey, Julie, it's me,
returning Howard's call.

482
00:37:58,111 --> 00:37:59,778
Yeah.

483
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,516
Hey, what's up?

484
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:06,518
Jimmy, I have just one question...

485
00:38:06,553 --> 00:38:08,086
Are you behind this?

486
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:10,555
Am I behind what?

487
00:38:42,422 --> 00:38:44,956
Jimmy, I'm kind of in the middle
of something' right now.

488
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,458
- Come back later.
- No, no, no.

489
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,959
Come on. Open the door.

490
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:50,562
I know why you're here.
We can discuss it later.

491
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:52,589
Right now I'm busy. Goodbye.

492
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,083
You happy now?

493
00:39:23,263 --> 00:39:26,297
It's not right... Me not having'
a key to this place.

494
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:31,770
Chuck?

495
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:05,336
So, Chuck... uh, what's up?

496
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,648
Um...

497
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:23,688
You got a little, uh...

498
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:28,259
You got a little, uh, uh, project going' on?

499
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:33,731
Uh, something you maybe wanna tell me about?

500
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:38,411
What do you say Chuck? Clue me in?

501
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,707
These walls are plaster and lath...

502
00:40:42,742 --> 00:40:45,477
completely invisible to the radio spectrum.

503
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:47,212
No protection at all...

504
00:40:47,247 --> 00:40:49,314
I might as well be standing
in the middle of a pasture.

505
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,915
I don't know what I was thinking.

506
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:52,584
I should've done this from the start.

507
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:56,254
What, you should've done
this, with the, uh...

508
00:40:56,289 --> 00:40:58,256
See, I think these walls
are pretty solid. I think...

509
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:00,992
See, what I really need
is a proper Faraday cage.

510
00:41:01,027 --> 00:41:02,660
That's what I need.

511
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:06,264
I think we need to sit down,
take a break, buddy.

512
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:07,332
Please?

513
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,534
Do not patronize me, Jimmy.

514
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,669
I'm not crazy, all right?

515
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:14,213
What? I never said you were crazy.

516
00:41:14,286 --> 00:41:16,453
That... You're probably exhausted,

517
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,042
a-and justifiably.

518
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:19,844
Hey, come on. Hey.

519
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,579
Five minutes, and then right back at it.

520
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:23,715
I'm fine.

521
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,116
Come on, Chuck.

522
00:41:26,753 --> 00:41:28,620
Just a break.

523
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,057
- Careful.
- I know.

524
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,540
Ohh.

525
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:54,579
Howard tells me you quit HHM.

526
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:56,814
I didn't quit.

527
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,149
I retired.

528
00:41:58,185 --> 00:42:01,786
That's not what it sounded like.

529
00:42:01,821 --> 00:42:05,056
Regardless, it's kinda out of
the blue, don't you think?

530
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,791
He's worried about you.

531
00:42:06,826 --> 00:42:08,993
He should be relieved.

532
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:11,462
Relieved? Why would he be relieved?

533
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:12,931
You're his Number One Guy.

534
00:42:12,966 --> 00:42:15,300
Without you, that whole place
goes down the drain.

535
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:20,405
So, you... you retired...

536
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,608
not just from HHM, but the law?

537
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:28,746
That's not good, Chuck.

538
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:32,083
The... The law... needs you.

539
00:42:32,118 --> 00:42:35,086
Just stop it.

540
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:37,622
And you need it.

541
00:42:37,657 --> 00:42:40,325
What brought this on exactly, Chuck?

542
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,359
Huh?

543
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,664
'Cause I don't know what you are
if you're not a lawyer.

544
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,335
Hey...

545
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,338
How are you gonna retire
before you get me disbarred,

546
00:42:53,373 --> 00:42:55,340
before you run me out
of the town on a rail, huh?

547
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,375
I'll be the only McGill
carrying the family name.

548
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,010
You can't have that.

549
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:05,416
Is this... Cause you lost Mesa Verde?

550
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,454
So what? Who cares?

551
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,823
And, hey, if you truly do think

552
00:43:11,858 --> 00:43:13,191
that I ratfucked you on that thing...

553
00:43:13,226 --> 00:43:14,626
which I did not, but whatever...

554
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:16,027
well, you know what?

555
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:17,962
You get mad! Take action!

556
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:20,865
Don't just hide out in your...
your Faraday whatever...

557
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,400
your cage thing here.

558
00:43:22,435 --> 00:43:25,136
No! You... No retirement for you!

559
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,972
When you're 99, you can drop dead

560
00:43:28,008 --> 00:43:30,808
giving closing arguments to JudgeBot 3000...

561
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:32,977
which will run on electricity, by the way.

562
00:43:33,013 --> 00:43:34,746
That's your future, okay?

563
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,849
- So...
- I...

564
00:43:37,884 --> 00:43:40,051
I can't do the job anymore.

565
00:43:40,086 --> 00:43:42,553
What do you mean?
Of course you can do the job.

566
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:43,688
I made a mistake.

567
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:45,089
What mistake?

568
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:47,859
A simple, nothing little bank address...

569
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:50,561
- 1216 instead of 1261.
- Oh.

570
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:51,896
I screwed it up!

571
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:53,498
I hurt the client.

572
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:59,604
Blew it completely and utterly.

573
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:03,441
And then I blamed... And then I blamed you.

574
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:08,713
It's this goddamned electricity!

575
00:44:08,748 --> 00:44:12,183
It's wearing me down!
It's wearing down my faculties!

576
00:44:12,218 --> 00:44:17,955
My brain... my mind... it used to be...

577
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:19,457
You know, it used to work!

578
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,025
And now it doesn't anymore.

579
00:44:21,061 --> 00:44:25,330
Mnh. People got hurt because of me.

580
00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:29,233
Time to end it.

581
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:39,477
What if I told you
you didn't make a mistake?

582
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:43,448
For Christ's sakes, Jimmy, stop humoring me.

583
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:45,583
Stop trying to talk everything right.

584
00:44:48,588 --> 00:44:50,321
Mnh.

585
00:44:50,357 --> 00:44:52,924
I ratfucked you.

586
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:57,462
It was me.

587
00:44:57,497 --> 00:45:00,598
I would've made Nixon proud.

588
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:06,437
I changed 1261 to 1216.

589
00:45:07,941 --> 00:45:10,608
It was me.

590
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:14,312
It all went down exactly like you said...

591
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:17,915
I mean, exactly.

592
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,917
I doctored the copies.

593
00:45:19,953 --> 00:45:22,587
I paid the kid at the shop to lie for me.

594
00:45:22,622 --> 00:45:24,455
It is insane

595
00:45:24,491 --> 00:45:29,527
how you got every detail exactly right.

596
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:33,431
So you can relax, okay?

597
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:35,666
'Cause that brain of yours is chugging along

598
00:45:35,702 --> 00:45:38,336
at 1,000% efficiency.

599
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:42,006
Are you telling the truth,

600
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:45,977
or are you just trying
to make me feel better?

601
00:45:46,012 --> 00:45:47,845
I am saying' it to make you feel better.

602
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:51,215
I sure as shit wouldn't
be telling you otherwise.

603
00:45:51,251 --> 00:45:55,052
But, yes... It's the truth.

604
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:58,623
You'd go to such lengths to humiliate me?

605
00:45:58,658 --> 00:46:01,159
I did it for Kim!

606
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:04,996
What... She worked her butt off
to get Mesa Verde

607
00:46:05,031 --> 00:46:09,066
while you and Howard sat around
sipping scotch and chortling.

608
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:12,170
Hamlin, Hamlin, McGill...
More like Scrooge and Marley!

609
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:16,674
Kim deserves Mesa Verde... Not you, not HHM.

610
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,310
She earned it, and she needs it!

611
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:21,012
I did it to help her,

612
00:46:21,047 --> 00:46:24,382
but I... I honestly didn't think
it would hurt you so bad.

613
00:46:24,417 --> 00:46:27,251
I thought you'd just say,
"Oh, crap, I made a mistake,"

614
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,687
and go on with your life,
like a normal person!

615
00:46:29,722 --> 00:46:31,022
But, oh, no!

616
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:32,924
Wishful thinking!

617
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:46,070
So, can I, uh, tell Howard

618
00:46:46,105 --> 00:46:49,207
you're not quitting or retiring or whatever?

619
00:46:57,317 --> 00:47:00,384
And can we take all this shit
down off the walls?

620
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,859
I'm gonna go call Howard.

621
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:09,427
Jimmy.

622
00:47:11,931 --> 00:47:16,200
You do realize you
just confessed to a felony?

623
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:18,302
I guess.

624
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:20,471
But you feel better, right?

625
00:47:21,774 --> 00:47:24,509
Besides, it's your word against mine.
