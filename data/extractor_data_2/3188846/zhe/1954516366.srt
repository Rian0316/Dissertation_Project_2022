1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,499
“创始吸血鬼”前情提要
ELlJAH: Previously on The Originals...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,605
这座城市曾经是我的家
我要夺回来
This town was my home once.
I want it back.

3
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,469
我们的社区正遭受攻击
Our community is under attack.

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:12,805
拥有强大力量的复活巫师？
是收获祭
Resurrected witches with vast power?
It's the Harvest.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:15,880
四个女孩照理应该死而复活
Four girls were meant to die
and be reborn.

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,812
有人劫走了那力量
Someone jacked that power.

7
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,646
我相信当你深爱着一个人
而那人也同样爱你
I believe that when you love someone
and that person loves you in return,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,254
你会变得格外脆弱
you're uniquely vulnerable.

9
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,549
莎莉丝特，是我害死了她
Celeste, she died because of me.

10
00:00:24,724 --> 00:00:28,160
如果你们能叫我的真名，我会很感激的
叫我莎莉丝特
I'd appreciate it if you'd call me
by my real name. Celeste.

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,317
那海莉呢？
What about Hayley?

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,088
我的任何背叛都比不上你对她的感情
None of my treachery
will harm this family

13
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:32,754
给我们家族造成的伤害
as much as your feelings for her.

14
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,197
这把刀包含着
我从吸血鬼身上收获的力量
This blade contains all the power
I harvested from the vampires.

15
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,700
它能做到的是比死亡更可怕的事情
It will do things worse than death.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,236
你准备好最后的献祭了吗？
And are you ready
for the final offering?

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,233
救命
Someone help me.

18
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,940
感谢各位前来
这对我来说意义重大
FATHER KlERAN: Thank you all for coming.
It means more than I can tell you.

19
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,350
今天大家齐聚一堂
We gather today
for the first public service

20
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,149
参加教堂重建后第一次布道
of our newly reopened church.

21
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:35,590
圣安妮终于能再次成为
我们社区的精神寄托
St. Anne's can finally once again
be the heart of our community,

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,629
将我们大家聚集在一起
where we can congregate
as a people united.

23
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:41,266
此时此刻
Here, this hour,

24
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,892
我们齐聚于此赞美上帝
并致上我们的感谢
we come together
to praise God and give thanks.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,076
教堂之前发生的事件是一场悲剧
The events that took place
at our church were tragic.

26
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:54,338
- 有什么问题吗？
- 没有
-Problem?
-No.

27
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:58,075
那就专心一点
要让人家觉得我们是虔诚的教区居民
Then pay attention. We're meant
to seem like devoted parishioners.

28
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,618
正因为我们心中仍怀希望
FATHER KlERAN:...and it is that hope
in our hearts,

29
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,551
也因为许多善心人士的慷慨相助
and with the help
of many benefactors,

30
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,283
我们今天才能再次坐在这里
that allows us to be here today.

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,555
因此我们以全新的灵魂聚集于此
更加坚强
So, we gather
with renewed spirit made stronger,

32
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:14,291
致力于爱与和平的理想
committed to the ideals
of peace and love.

33
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,436
- 阿门
- 阿门
-Amen.
-ALL: Amen.

34
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,267
每座坟墓都有人精心打理
Each tomb is well cared for.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,738
人们以爱来悼念自己已故的先人…
Families honor their dead
with displays of affection...

36
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:26,071
有人吗？
Is someone there?

37
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:29,238
这座坟墓属于德弗罗家族
这个家族向来因与巫术的紧密联系
...belongs to the Deveraux family,
known throughout the Quarter

38
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,973
闻名于法语区
for their strong connection
to witchcraft.

39
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,142
拜托救救我
(SOBBlNG) Please help me.

40
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,220
仔细看看这里，这些新砌的砖块
And if you look close,
these fresh bricks

41
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,552
说明这个家族最近有人去世了
tell us someone in the family
has recently fallen.

42
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,890
- 那是什么声音？
- 放我出去！
-What is that?
-Let me out.

43
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,036
你好，莫妮克
Hello, Monique.

44
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,981
欢迎回到人间
Welcome back
to the land of the living.

45
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,850
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：新月之城

46
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,970
怎么了？发生什么事了？
What is it?
What's going on?

47
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,875
奇迹发生了
It's a miracle.

48
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:41,681
莫妮克？
Monique?

49
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,226
你活过来了
You're alive? Oh!

50
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:55,196
主演：约瑟夫摩根

51
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,226
今早的布道真不错，神父
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
KLAUS: Lovely sermon this morning, Father.

52
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,568
非常鼓舞人心
主演：克莱儿荷特
Quite inspirational.

53
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:00,868
我没想到你会来参加
主演：克莱儿荷特
FATHER KlERAN: I wasn't
expecting you to join us.

54
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,439
我们来是想听听
We were hoping for some word
from your human sources

55
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,171
你对最近的海地入侵有没有什么线索
主演：菲比托金
on the recent Haitian invasion.

56
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,370
我的人已经尽力打听了
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
My guys have their ears
to the ground.

57
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,037
但没有人听到任何
And no one has seen or heard

58
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,141
关于你们说的那个人的消息
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
any sign of whatever his name is.

59
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,080
他叫图德巫父
He's called Papa Tunde.

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,379
如今，他身上聚集着所有
主演：莉雅派普斯
And right now,
he's wandering the Quarter

61
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,543
我埋在花园的吸血鬼的力量
with the power he absorbed

62
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,984
正在这附近四处游荡
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
from every soul
I had buried in the garden.

63
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,251
所以你或许该让你的人
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
So, you might want to put your ear

64
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,349
再更加努力一点
a little closer to the ground.

65
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:23,427
或者我也可以选择逃离这场
Or I could steer clear
of whatever war is brewing

66
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,123
你们之间一触即发的战争
在我还没陷入…
between your kind and his
before I find myself--

67
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,097
恭喜你
I wanted to congratulate you

68
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,258
教堂又重新对大家开放了
on getting the church up
and running.

69
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,132
看得出你现在不方便说话
很高兴见到你，马赛尔
I can see this is a bad time.
Nice to see you, Marcel.

70
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,238
卡蜜
MARCEL: Cami.

71
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,372
别看着我
我已试着让她离开了
Well, don't look at me.
I tried to send her away.

72
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,244
迪亚哥，有什么消息吗？
Yes, Diego,
what do you have for me?

73
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,020
- 我们收到一样特别的东西
- 你能说清楚点吗？
-Uh, we got a special delivery.
- Would you care to elaborate?

74
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,826
不知这代表我们的女巫问题解决了
还是才刚刚开始
DlEGO: Either our witch problems are
over or they're just getting started.

75
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,627
- 马赛尔
- 再见，神父
-Marcel.
-Father.

76
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,297
制片：兰斯安德森

77
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,506
上帝与你同在
God be with you.

78
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,941
谢谢，上帝与你同在
Thank you.
God be with you.

79
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:13,544
谢谢，上帝与你同在
Thank you.
God be with you.

80
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,704
我可不这么想，但还是感谢你的祝福
Oh, I doubt that
but I do appreciate the thought.

81
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:17,042
贝丝蒂娜
Bastiana.

82
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:26,418
当你在地狱见到你侄子西恩时
替我向他问好
Give your nephew Sean my regards
when you see him in hell.

83
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,493
制片：邦妮怀斯

84
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:39,494
需要什么道具吗，哥哥？
放大镜，还是烟斗？
Can I get you anything, brother?
A magnifying glass, a pipe perhaps?

85
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,266
不如跟大家说说你的看法如何
尼克劳斯？
You have a theory that you'd like
to share with us, Niklaus?

86
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,602
过去，女巫们要表达威胁时
MARCEL: Back in the day,
the witches wanted to send a threat,

87
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,267
她们会杀一只鸡然后放在你门口
they'd just kill a chicken
and leave it on your doorstep.

88
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,176
那这还真是只不吉利的大公鸡啊
你说是吗？
It's rather a large and
ominous chicken, wouldn't you say?

89
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,548
图德巫父轻易制服了蕾贝卡
Papa Tunde defeated Rebekah
with ease,

90
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,277
还差点也解决了我们俩
almost got the two of us as well.

91
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,218
如果他真是跟女巫们一边的
If he was supposed to be
their prize fighter,

92
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,186
为什么她们要杀死他
why leave him for dead

93
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,282
还放在我们前院？
编剧：麦克纳度奇，茱莉普烈克
in our front yard?

94
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,690
看起来你们精神都不错啊
编剧：麦克纳度奇，茱莉普烈克
Well, don't you all look cheery.

95
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,583
听听这个
Listen to this.

96
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,094
今天莎宾在带领游客参观墓地时
A girl literally exploded
from a grave today

97
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:07,323
一个女孩从坟墓里爬了出来
as Sabine was giving her tour
of the City of the Dead.

98
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,735
- 那女孩是莫妮克德弗罗
- 你说什么？
-lt was Monique Deveraux.
-What?

99
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,268
游客们还以为是安排的表演
The tourists thought
it was part of the show,

100
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,735
但女巫们都认为这是奇迹
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
but the witches are celebrating like

101
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,138
正在大肆庆祝呢
导演：克里斯葛瑞斯莫
it's some kind of bloody miracle.

102
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,139
谁说不是呢？
她们本以为没希望了
Maybe it is.
They think that all hope is lost

103
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,301
但如今一个收获祭女孩突然复活了
but now suddenly a Harvest girl
is resurrected.

104
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,008
或许我们也可以这样救回黛维娜
This is how
we're gonna get Davina back.

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,149
杀死取代她位置的女巫
Kill the witch who took her place.

106
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:29,414
我或许知道那个人是谁
莎莉丝特
I have a theory about who
one of them could be. Celeste.

107
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,524
一定是她
黛维娜之前就试着告诉我们
I mean, it's got to be.
Davina was trying to tell us.

108
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,320
她画了许多莎莉丝特的画像
She was drawing pictures of Celeste.

109
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,520
她是在警告我们邪恶即将来临
She was warning us
that a great evil was coming.

110
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,599
先是图德巫父回来找我们算旧帐
First, Papa Tunde returns
to settle old scores.

111
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:43,997
现在你那被杀的旧情人也回来了
Now your murdered lover is back.

112
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,833
这不是单纯的女巫攻击吸血鬼事件
This isn't witches attacking vampires.

113
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,904
她们是在向我们宣战
They're declaring war on us.

114
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,944
现在喝酒不算早吧？
It's not too early for Scotch, is it?

115
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:03,020
毕竟我们要应付一堆女巫的
鬼把戏和阴谋诡计
With all the witches' shenanigans
and subterfuge afoot.

116
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,090
如果你待会要开车的话
这确实太早了
It is entirely too early
if one intends to drive, yes.

117
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,693
是吗？但我可没打算出去
Funny. I don't have any plans
to go anywhere.

118
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,056
她留在这里不安全
She's not safe here.

119
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:14,929
你得将海莉带到种植园去
You have to take Hayley
to the plantation house

120
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,363
直到这一切结束
until this is over.

121
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:19,767
你是在担心海莉
还是担心你信不过我？
Are you worried about Hayley
or whether or not you can trust me?

122
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,399
正是因为信任你
我才会请求你做这件事
It's precisely because I trust you
that I'm asking you to do this.

123
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:25,566
我有个想法
Here's a novel idea.

124
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,440
何不让海莉自己决定呢？
Why don't you let Hayley
decide for herself?

125
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:30,980
为什么要由你决定她的命运？
Why are you dictating her fate?

126
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,583
你知道的
You know why.

127
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,913
那或许你该亲自带她去
Then perhaps
you should take her yourself.

128
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,111
如果这样做，我就真成了
Well, then that would make me
the very hypocrite

129
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,052
你口中所说的伪君子了
that you've accused me of being.

130
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,990
蕾贝卡，我无法克制自己的情感
Rebekah,
I cannot legislate my feelings.

131
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,150
但我的行为则不同
My actions, however...

132
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,667
所以你能好心帮我这个忙吗？
So, would you kindly do this for me?

133
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:55,066
你知道这位狼妈妈最不喜欢受人指使了
You know the mama wolf loves
to be told what to do.

134
00:07:56,742 --> 00:08:02,442
她不会喜欢的
但为了你我会这么做
She's not gonna like it
but I will do it for you.

135
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,517
只要能停止我们之间这愚蠢的争执
If only to end this silly quarrel
between the two of us.

136
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,488
你这是在干什么？
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

137
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,563
听着，大家都在四处寻找复活的女巫
Listen, everybody's running off,
looking for resurrected witches.

138
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,725
我想我在教堂见到了其中一个
洁妮薇
Meanwhile, I think I saw one
at the church, Genevieve.

139
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,268
- 你说什么？
- 我不确定
-What?
-I can't be sure.

140
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,599
我只是无意中看到了她
I only caught her out
of the corner of my eye.

141
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,762
之后我一直跟克劳斯在一起
Been with Klaus since.

142
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,169
但那个人看起来很像她
But it looked like her.

143
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,633
我们都知道
And you and I both know

144
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,110
她回来是有原因的
that she would have a reason
to wanna be back.

145
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,715
那些多年前的旧帐
A lot of unfinished business,

146
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:40,182
那些我们不想被别人知道的秘密
a lot of secrets that you and l
don't want getting out.

147
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,487
我现在要带海莉去种植园
I have to take Hayley
to the plantation.

148
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,354
你得找到洁妮薇，结束这一切
You need to find Genevieve
and end this.

149
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,519
就像上次一样
End it like we did the last time.

150
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:57,995
请给我杯茶
Tea, please.

151
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,474
- 我很忙
- 卡蜜，听我说
-I'm busy.
-Cami, just hear me out.

152
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,018
我去参加你的教堂重开仪式
You know, I came to your reopening

153
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,518
是因为我想试着去弥补
because I wanted to try
and make amends.

154
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,852
然后我看到你大庭广众之下
跟克劳斯交谈
And then I see you talking
with Klaus out in the open,

155
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,324
一副谈论法语区公事的样子
Iike it's business as usual
in the Quarter.

156
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,894
确实是公事
It is business as usual.

157
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,530
三百多年来
For the past three centuries,

158
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,495
欧康诺家的人一直在努力维护和平
the O'Connells have always tried
to keep the peace.

159
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:31,068
别跟我扯家族历史
谎话连篇
Save me the family history.
It's all lies on top of lies.

160
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,831
卡蜜，给我倒杯酒
Cami, pour me a drink.

161
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,804
我有事要跟你说
I have to tell you something.

162
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:54,286
- 基兰叔叔，你怎么了？
- 我有麻烦了
-Uncle Kieran, what's wrong?
-I'm in trouble.

163
00:09:55,761 --> 00:10:00,130
发生在你哥哥西恩身上的事
要在我身上重演了
What happened to your brother Sean
is about to start happening to me.

164
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,028
什么？
What?

165
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,930
我…
I've...

166
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:12,410
听着，我被下咒了
Look, I've been hexed.

167
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,905
- 我不知道我还剩多长时间
- 等等，我认识一些人
-And I don't know how long I have.
-Wait. I know some people.

168
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,485
一定有办法，我说不清
解药或…
There has to be some sort of,
I don't know, antidote or...

169
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:25,954
卡蜜，我要你答应我一件事
Cami, I need you
to promise me one thing

170
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,592
一旦情况恶化
that when it gets bad,

171
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,490
你要离我越远越好
I need you to be
as far away from me as possible.

172
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:34,360
不，不要
一定会有办法解决的
No. No.
There has to be some sort of way.

173
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,023
当然有
Of course there is.

174
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:41,264
如果你想救你叔叔的命
你只需要拿着这个
If you wanna save your uncle's life,
all you have to do is take this.

175
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,536
然后刺入克劳斯米卡森的心脏
And make sure it ends up
in Klaus Mikaelson's heart.

176
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,583
我以为要让你来这里
I thought I was gonna have
to drag you

177
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,317
得使用一些暴力手段
to the plantation
kicking and screaming.

178
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,257
是啊，但大家都只是想保护我和孩子
对吧？
Yeah. Well, we all just wanna
protect me and the baby, right?

179
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:07,661
嘿，我是支持你的，记得吗？
出什么事了？
Hey. I'm on your side, remember?
So what gives?

180
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,964
今晚是满月，蕾贝卡
Tonight's a full moon, Rebekah.

181
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,503
那又怎样？你怀孕了，不能变身
So what? You're preggers.
You can't turn.

182
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,938
对，但我想邀请一些人过来
Yes. But I wanted to invite
a few people over.

183
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,508
我懂了
Of course.

184
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,578
精力充沛的美国狼人
Every red-blooded American werewolf

185
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:22,771
在今晚都会变成长毛利齿的野兽
will be a bundle of fur
and sharp teeth tonight

186
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,381
而你们被诅咒的新月狼族会变成…
whilst your cursed
Crescent clan will be--

187
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,178
人类，但只能维持几小时
Human, but only for a few hours

188
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,321
再变身只能等下个满月了
and won't be again
until the next full moon.

189
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,857
所以我请小约帮我去河口传个话给伊芙
So, I asked Josh to get a message out
to Eve in the bayou.

190
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,755
小约还没死吗？
Josh isn't dead yet?

191
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,261
不错嘛他
我喜欢听精彩的逃生故事
Well, good on him.
I love a nice survival story.

192
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:41,263
那是谁啊？
Who the bloody hell is that?

193
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:46,696
- 啤酒桶在后面对吧？
- 是的
-Kegs out back, right?
-Yup.

194
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:47,896
好吧
Right.

195
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:49,405
看来你没打算征得我的同意
It appears you weren't gonna wait
for me

196
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:51,566
就想办一个啤酒派对
to grant you permission
to throw a kegger.

197
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,008
听着，你们都希望我安全，没问题
Listen, you all want me safe, fine.

198
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,241
我会乖乖听话
做象牙塔中的少女
I'll do as I'm told.
I'll play damsel in the glass tower.

199
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,386
但每个月只有今晚我才能见到家人
But tonight's the one night a month
that I can meet my family.

200
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,216
你可以去告我的状，让我被关禁闭
Now, you could rat me out,
send me to my room

201
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:09,225
或者帮我办个超赞的派对
or you could help me throw
one hell of a party.

202
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,601
以利亚
找我有何贵干？
Elijah.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

203
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,607
我家人需要一名女巫的帮助
My family needs an ally
among the witches

204
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:27,507
而你曾经帮助过我们
and you've helped us in the past.

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,705
也许我们可以一起
阻止一场不必要的争端
Perhaps together we can avoid
an unnecessary conflict.

206
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:35,115
如果对象是高尚的以利亚
她们可能愿意商量
They may be willing to make a deal
if it were with the noble Elijah.

207
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:38,747
但只要牵扯到克劳斯
就没有任何和平可言
But there will never be any peace
as long as it involves Klaus.

208
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,484
这就是你们的目的吗？
希望我弟弟离开这里？
Is that what all this is about?
You want my brother out of town?

209
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,719
我只是告诉你她们的想法
I'm just telling you how they feel.

210
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,796
我的族人很害怕，她们虽然绝望
My people are scared.
They're desperate

211
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:48,160
却并不傻
but they're not dumb.

212
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,426
你的侄女快出生了
You have a niece on the way.

213
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,829
谁都会开始考虑
It stands to reason
you'd be willing to discuss

214
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,267
如何赶他离开
how to run him out of the city.

215
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:58,134
一起散个步吧
Let's walk together.

216
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,176
你可以带我去参观一下那些著名景点
You can take me
on one of your famous tours.

217
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,751
你得吃点东西
毕竟你经历了这么多
You should eat after everything
you've been through.

218
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,717
我是死过的人了
I was dead.

219
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,117
但你又活过来了啊
But you're here now.

220
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,426
苏菲阿姨，妈妈怎么了？
Aunt Sophie, what happened to Mom?

221
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:29,105
你妈妈非常爱你
Your mother loved you so much.

222
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:32,403
她坚信自己能够用魔法
She had faith
that she could use magic

223
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,981
完成收获祭
并让你复活
to complete the Harvest
and get you back.

224
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:42,018
最后，她为此牺牲了自己
In the end, she sacrificed herself
for the cause,

225
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:45,555
为了女巫们，为了你
for the witches, for you.

226
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,525
你也跟她有一样的信念吗？
And do you have her faith?

227
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,991
我失去了信念
I lost my faith.

228
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,235
然后我意识到，如果我不相信
Then I realized that if I didn't believe,

229
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,067
一定会让你失望
I would be letting you down.

230
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:07,742
我试图找回信念，真的
I tried to get it back.
I tried.

231
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,505
莫妮克德弗罗
MARCEL: Monique Deveraux.

232
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,216
法语区的人都在谈论你
Everyone in the Quarter's
been talking about you.

233
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,748
好极了
Classy.

234
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:20,517
你杀了她妈妈
现在又来威胁她了？
You kill her mother
and now you've come to threaten her?

235
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,820
我不是来威胁谁的
I'm not here to threaten anyone.

236
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,897
你想干什么，马赛尔？
What do you want, Marcel?

237
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,500
收获祭还牺牲了另外三个女孩
There were three more girls
sacrificed during the Harvest.

238
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,657
我想让她们复活
I wanna bring them back.

239
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,829
你骗谁啊？
你才不在乎那些女孩
Who are you kidding?
You don't care about those girls.

240
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,567
你只是想让黛维娜复活
继续利用她的力量
You just want Davina back
so you can use her power again.

241
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:41,076
- 我只想让她活过来
- 他说的是实话
-I just want her alive.
-He's telling the truth.

242
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:47,445
- 你怎么知道？
- 我感觉得到
-How do you know that?
-I can feel it.

243
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,579
他对她很忠诚
他是来帮忙的
He's loyal to her.
He's here to help.

244
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,699
我收到你的简讯了
基兰现在在哪？
I got your message.
Where's Kieran now?

245
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,068
他在阁楼休息，祷告
In the attic resting, praying.

246
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,473
他会发疯然后死掉，是吗？
He's gonna go crazy and die, isn't he?

247
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,409
就跟西恩一样
Just like Sean.

248
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,311
我们却还愚蠢地争吵着
And we'll still be in this stupid fight

249
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:23,922
因为关于女巫的事
吸血鬼的事
because he lied to me
about the witches and vampires.

250
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,351
和你的事，他骗了我
And you.

251
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:29,388
卡蜜儿
Camille...

252
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:36,467
我明白你为什么讨厌我
...I can see why you hate me.

253
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:41,197
说实话，我干过很多可怕的事
Truth be told,
I have done some dreadful things.

254
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:44,570
但你叔叔是为了保护你才骗你
But the lies your uncle told
were meant to protect you.

255
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:49,646
他是个好人
忠实可靠
He is a good man with a loyal heart.

256
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,141
他是你的家人
And he is your family.

257
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,346
至于那些女巫
As for these witches,

258
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,253
她们对基兰下手就足以证明
their attack on Kieran
should be proof enough

259
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,917
她们是敌人
they're the enemy.

260
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,553
因此我们要团结起来
In that, we are united.

261
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,733
克劳斯
Klaus.

262
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,752
这是图德巫父的刀
This is Papa Tunde's blade.

263
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,854
一个女巫给我的
Awitch gave it to me.

264
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,458
说它可以造成无边的痛苦和折磨
哪怕对方是吸血鬼真祖
Said it would cause untold pain
and torment, even to an Original.

265
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,627
她说如果我把它刺进你的心脏
She said if I stuck it
in your heart,

266
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,786
她就会治愈基兰
she would heal Kieran.

267
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,195
而你选择了拒绝她们的提议
And yet you chose to reject their offer.

268
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,027
如果我更像你一点，我会下手的
Maybe if I were more like you,
I could do it.

269
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,766
- 但我不…
- 不是恶魔
-But I'm not--
-A monster.

270
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,638
我可不傻
I'm not stupid.

271
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,144
如果有战争要发生
我希望站在赢的一边
If there's a war going on,
I wanna be on the winning side.

272
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,178
来看看怎么救你叔叔吧，好吗？
Let's see what we can do
about saving your uncle, shall we?

273
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,642
又见面了
Hello, again.

274
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,719
我一直盼望着能快点见到你
I'm looking forward to meeting you soon.

275
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,608
你这是开玩笑吧
You've got to be kidding me.

276
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:08,481
一个吸血鬼想要帮你解除
女巫在你身上下的咒
A vampire is trying to reverse
a witch's hex placed on you

277
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,316
你却觉得这杯子亵渎神明
and it's the cup
you find sacrilegious.

278
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:26,528
- 你确定这样行得通吗？
- 我也不确定
-Are you sure this is going to work?
-Not remotely.

279
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:28,297
但如果神父体内有马鞭草
But I can't attempt
to use my compulsion

280
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:29,668
我就不能使用魅惑
to counter Bastiana's curse

281
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,867
来对付贝丝蒂娜的咒语
if the good father
has vervain in his system.

282
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:34,672
所以先给他放个血
Thus we bleed him out.

283
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:37,879
我可没说过事情会很容易
I never said this would be pleasant.

284
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,280
就做你该做的事情吧
Just do what you have to do.

285
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,667
我说到做到，马赛尔
如果你再不回电告诉我情况
So, help me God, Marcel,
if you don't call me back with an update,

286
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,934
我就亲手杀了你
I will kill you myself.

287
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,280
不好意思
I beg your pardon.

288
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,154
我以为客人会更毛茸茸一点
I was expecting someone furrier.

289
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,826
你是其中一个，对吗？
吸血鬼真祖
You're one of them, aren't you?
An Original.

290
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:33,165
对，你的语气可以稍微尊敬一点
Yes. You might want to say that
with some more respect.

291
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:38,173
- 我想你是要找海莉吧
- 或者我也可以跟你聊聊
-I suppose you'll be wanting Hayley.
-Or I could just talk to you.

292
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,079
我叫奥利佛
还不知道你叫什么
I'm Oliver.
I didn't catch your name.

293
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,146
蕾贝卡
I'm Rebekah.

294
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,121
海莉，参加派对的人来了
Hayley, the party's here.

295
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,226
你的力量还够找到那些女巫吗？
You got enough power left
to find these witches?

296
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:02,993
我知道收获祭是个大失败
但我还有能力施定位咒的
I know the Harvest was an epic fail
but I can still do a locator spell.

297
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,500
在那之前
我们得做个交易
Before I do that,
we need to make a deal.

298
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:06,968
什么交易？
What deal?

299
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,699
如果我背叛了这些女巫
她们会来找我麻烦
If I betray these witches,
they're gonna come looking for me.

300
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,900
如果我被抓住，我就死定了
And if I'm caught, I'm dead.

301
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,203
我说了我会保护你
I said I'd protect you.

302
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,367
如果你真能做到
If you could do that,

303
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,877
一开始你也不会找我帮忙了
you wouldn't need my help
in the first place.

304
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,413
法语区危机四伏
The Quarter isn't safe.

305
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,245
吸血鬼雄踞一方
女巫与之对抗自成一派
Vampires on one side,
witches on the other.

306
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,219
我绝不可能让莫妮克陷入其中
No way am I letting Monique
get in the middle of that.

307
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,084
为了带她离开
我需要钱
In order to get her out,
I'm gonna need money.

308
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,455
成交吗？
Do we have a deal?

309
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,727
找到那些女巫
我会给你想要的一切
Find the witches, I'll give you
anything you could ever need.

310
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,786
来吧，你可以跳得更好的
Well, come on.
You can do better than that.

311
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,051
抱歉，我今晚脑子很乱
Sorry.
I've got a burdened brain tonight.

312
00:21:02,227 --> 00:21:04,525
不行，不行
今晚得抛开所有包袱
No, no, no.
Tonight is not a night for burdens.

313
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,591
好好庆祝一番
It's to celebrate.

314
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:08,926
尽情享受
It's to enjoy life

315
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,296
这几小时的人类生活
for the few hours
that we get to live it.

316
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,272
我们要拥抱朋友、家人
还要疯狸地跳舞
It's to hug our friends, our family
and to dance our asses off.

317
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:45,799
我不信你邀请我们来只是为了招待我们
MAN: I seriously doubt
you invited us here to wait on us.

318
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:54,402
你是海莉，我叫杰克森
You're Hayley.
I'm Jackson.

319
00:21:55,614 --> 00:21:56,808
很高兴又见面了
It's nice to see you again.

320
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,213
你就是那头一直看着我的狼
You're the wolf
who's been watching me.

321
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,822
我必须要盯着你
以及你体内的珍品
I got to keep my eye on you,
precious cargo and all.

322
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,358
没错
得保护这个奇迹般的孩子
Right.
Got to protect the miracle baby.

323
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,463
不，我不是这个意思
我不在乎这个孩子
No. That's not what I meant.
I don't care about the baby.

324
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,928
抱歉，那样说不对
我当然在乎孩子
Sorry. That came out wrong.
I mean, of course I care.

325
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:22,267
你是拉伯奈家族的一员
孩子就是大事
You're a Labonair.
A baby, it's a big deal.

326
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:26,172
但我个人对你更有兴趣
But personally,
my interest is in you.

327
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,939
你根本不认识我
You don't even know me.

328
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,581
我们的父母互相认识
Our parents knew each other.

329
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:35,686
他们是同一阶级的人
但不是同一血脉
They were of the same people
but not the same bloodline.

330
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,378
你知道狼族阶级制度是如何运作的吧？
Now, you know
how pack hierarchy works, right?

331
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:42,755
每个人都有设定好的角色
我们也不例外
Everybody has their part to play
and we had our part too.

332
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,097
我们的角色是什么？
What part was that?

333
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,667
你应该是我的妻子
You were supposed to be my wife.

334
00:22:57,743 --> 00:22:59,836
接下来的这片区域是城里为数不多
SABlNE: So this next part of town
is one of the few areas

335
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,879
还保留着最初法国建筑的地区之一
where any of the original
French architecture remains.

336
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,641
大部分建筑在18世纪就毁了
Most of the buildings
were destroyed in the 1700s

337
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,342
那时大火第一次吞噬了这座城市
when the city burned
for the first time.

338
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:12,990
我说这些很无聊吧？
Am I putting you to sleep?

339
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,716
你可能觉得惊讶
As surprising
as you might find this,

340
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,360
并不是每天都有人要你
it's not every day
that someone asks you

341
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:20,692
背叛自己的兄弟…
莎莉丝特
to betray your own brother, Celeste.

342
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,860
你怎么发现的？
How did you know?

343
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:29,438
当黛维娜画了你的画像时
As Davina was drawing your likeness,

344
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:33,374
我就大胆猜测你就在附近
I dared to imagine
that your presence was near.

345
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:34,842
然后当苏菲发现
And when Sophie discovered

346
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:39,382
你的遗骸里没有法力
我便怀疑
that there was no magic
in your remains, I wondered...

347
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,815
你是不是有可能诈死
Could you have possibly
cheated death

348
00:23:41,987 --> 00:23:43,716
用法力将你的本体
by using your power
to place your essence

349
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:44,913
转移到其他人体内？
into the body of another?

350
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,718
如果是这样，那会是谁？
And if so, then who?

351
00:23:49,661 --> 00:23:53,995
然后我回想起可爱的莎宾
And then I recalled the lovely Sabine.

352
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,566
你要一直跟踪我吗，以利亚？
Are you gonna continue
following me, Elijah?

353
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,963
还是你想谈谈？
Or do you wanna talk?

354
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,626
你知道我是谁
You know who I am.

355
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,966
老是穿西装的吸血鬼真祖
Original vampire,
always wears a suit?

356
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,869
你看到了我弟弟孩子的幻象
Your visions of my brother's child

357
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:07,500
促成了你们女巫最后一位长老的死亡
precipitated the death
of the last elder within your coven.

358
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,738
告诉她们你看到了什么
Tell them what you saw.

359
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,051
你要确保收获祭仪式绝不能完成
Ensuring that the Harvest ritual
could not be completed

360
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:19,952
除非你能掌控它
unless you were to control it.

361
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:25,992
你真的下了很大的一盘棋
You have been playing
a very long game indeed.

362
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,598
为了什么？
To what end?

363
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:52,953
以利亚
我失落的爱人
Oh, Elijah... my lost love.

364
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,390
经过这么长时间
After all this time...

365
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,331
你还不明白吗？
Don't you understand?

366
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,332
我因克劳斯而死
I died because of Klaus.

367
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,339
就算是他这样恶意中伤女巫害死了我
Even after all his vindictive lies
about witches led to my death,

368
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,343
你仍站在他那边
只因你“永远在一起”的誓言
you stood by him all because
of your vow, "Always and forever."

369
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,775
你对我做了什么？
What have you done to me?

370
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:18,939
就是个简单的法术
不用担心
It's a simple enchantment.
You needn't worry.

371
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:22,148
我不是来杀你的，以利亚
I'm not here to kill you, Elijah.

372
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,015
我要让你知道你的方式是错的
I'm here to teach you
the error of your ways.

373
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,283
“永远在一起”是你一生最大的错误
Always and forever was the greatest
mistake of your life.

374
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:41,197
喝了它
能治好你的伤
Drink up.
It will heal your wound.

375
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,906
我觉得你受的苦已经差不多了
I think you've suffered enough.

376
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,750
你会战胜
女巫对你所做的一切
You will overcome
what the witches did to you.

377
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,587
你能抵抗她们的魔法带来的黑暗冲动
You will resist
the dark urges of their hex.

378
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,535
- 有用吗？
- 我怎么知道有没有用
-Did it work?
-How do I know if it worked?

379
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:17,402
我只知道我体内没有马鞭草了
All I know is that the vervain is out

380
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,203
只能任由这个杀人魔摆布
and I'm at the mercy
of this murderous bastard.

381
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:23,370
你一定觉得这很好笑对吧
卡蜜，你这个小…
I bet you find that really funny,
don't you, Cami, you little--

382
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,952
对不起
我不知道我为什么会说这些
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

383
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,814
好吧
这就是答案了
Well, I guess that's our answer.

384
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,321
等等
克劳斯，你要去哪？
我们该怎么办？
Wait. Klaus, where are you going?
What are we going to do?

385
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,459
我要去查出是哪个女巫干的
I'm gonna find the witch
who did this.

386
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,892
然后我就要做我最拿手的事
And then I'm gonna do
what I do best.

387
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,198
我比我想像的要弱
I'm weaker than I thought.

388
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,236
你想要交易，苏菲
那你就得遵守诺言
You want the deal, Soph,
you got to hold up your end.

389
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,307
我时间紧迫
I'm on a clock.

390
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,641
好吧
SOPHlE: Okay.

391
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,806
成功了
It's working.

392
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,349
那才一个，我要三个
That's one.
I need all three.

393
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:04,954
我正在尽我所能
I'm giving you whatever I can pick up.

394
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,591
- 继续努力
- 或者不用了
-Keep trying.
-KLAUS: Or don't.

395
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,219
筹码就在眼前
Who needs a locator spell

396
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:13,626
我还需要什么定位咒呢？
when I have all the leverage
I need right here?

397
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,231
不，莫妮克
No! Monique!

398
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,761
你居然利用亲我的时候下毒
You've poisoned me with a kiss.

399
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,964
至少你还跟以前一样爱讽刺人
At least you haven't lost
your sense of irony.

400
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,702
我们也许还有时间说点别的
We may have time for more.

401
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,642
但首先我要把你最大的缺点治好
But first, I'm going to cure you
of your greatest flaw.

402
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:34,242
这种荒谬的对疯子般家人的奉献
This absurd devotion
to your lunatic family.

403
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,853
我也和你一样愤怒
Your anger is with me.

404
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:38,216
如果你是来报仇的…
Now, if you have come here
seeking revenge--

405
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,984
仇我一定会报
从克劳斯开始
Oh, I'll have my revenge,
starting with Klaus.

406
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,993
他会尝到前所未有的痛苦和折磨
He is gonna know pain and torment
like he's never felt before.

407
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,131
当然，除非你选择要救他
Unless you choose to save him,
of course.

408
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,133
但那就剩下了蕾贝卡
你悲惨的妹妹
But then that leaves Rebekah,
your tragic sister.

409
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,601
她马上就会发现自己深陷窘境
She's about to find herself
in quite the predicament.

410
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,708
你可以救她
You could save her.

411
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,311
但那样海莉就危险了
But then
that leaves Hayley in jeopardy.

412
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:06,416
- 不，不，不
- 这个可怜的女孩
-No. No, no.
-Ah, this poor girl.

413
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,451
她完全不知道被你所爱
是一件多么危险的事
She has no idea how dangerous it is
to be loved by you.

414
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,516
当然
Oh, well.

415
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,491
你的身体被我的咒语所削弱
你不可能救他们所有人
With your body weakened by my spell,
you won't be able to save them all.

416
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,955
你恢复后的时间只够你选择救一个人
You'll recover
with just enough time to choose one.

417
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:29,130
会是谁呢？
真是迫不及待想知道呢
Who will it be?
I can't wait to find out.

418
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:42,646
法语区的女巫们
KLAUS: Witches of the French Quarter,

419
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,587
我身边这位是莫妮克德弗罗
I have with me Monique Deveraux.

420
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,726
刚刚脱离死亡的她
What a shame it would be

421
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:53,728
如果被我不得不再次杀死，就太可惜了
were I forced to send her back
to the death she's just escaped.

422
00:28:53,898 --> 00:29:00,167
不想让这种事情发生的话
就把女巫贝丝蒂娜给我带来
Should you wish to prevent this,
bring me the witch Bastiana.

423
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,533
你这是在干什么？
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

424
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:03,833
我在谈判啊
I'm opening negotiations.

425
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:05,839
你知道我的规矩，我们不伤害孩子
You know my rules.
We do not hurt kids.

426
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,978
省省你那虚伪的道德准则吧
Spare me the hypocrisy
of your moral code.

427
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:11,604
那也没能阻止你杀死莫妮克的妈妈
It didn't stop you
from killing Monique's mother.

428
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:13,910
贝丝蒂娜
Bastiana.

429
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,178
我知道你就在附近
I know you're close.

430
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,551
空气中弥漫着女巫的恶臭
The stench of witches hangs in the air.

431
00:29:19,724 --> 00:29:22,591
记住我的话
Mark my words.

432
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,853
我要用你打算
I will end this girl

433
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,825
对付我的这把刀杀死这女孩
with the very blade
you meant for me.

434
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,055
我不会再说第二遍
I'm not saying it again!

435
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,397
我们不杀孩子
We do not kill kids.

436
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,080
在这里，由我决定谁生谁死，马赛勒斯
I decide who lives
and dies here, Marcellus.

437
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,712
接着就交给我吧
I'll take it from here.

438
00:30:37,132 --> 00:30:41,068
- 我知道这很难接受
- 你觉得是吗？
-I know it's a lot to take in.
-You think?

439
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:42,863
我只是想见见我的家人
I just wanted to meet my family.

440
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:44,596
我从没想过我会过见我的丈夫
I never imagined
I'd meet my husband

441
00:30:44,773 --> 00:30:47,640
还是什么奇怪的安排婚姻
from some weird-ass
arranged marriage.

442
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:49,900
我猜你对此一无所知
I guess you don't know about
any of this

443
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:52,809
因为你身边没有人教导你
because there was never anyone
around to teach you.

444
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:59,243
新月狼族并不只是随便的一群狼
The Crescents aren't just
any pack of wolves. Okay?

445
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:02,356
此一血脉可追溯到最开始
The bloodline goes back
to the very beginning.

446
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:05,550
两个家族，你的和我的
Two families.
Yours and mine.

447
00:31:07,563 --> 00:31:10,225
我想这就让我们变得跟皇室一样了
I guess that makes us kind of like royalty.

448
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,199
这是玩笑，对吧？
This is a joke, right?

449
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,928
如果你是皇室，你的王座在哪呢？
I mean, if you're royalty,
where's the throne?

450
00:31:20,743 --> 00:31:24,076
纽奥良曾经是我们的城市
New Orleans used to be our town.

451
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:27,647
因为一些明争暗斗，我们失去了一切
And we lost it all because
of some infighting.

452
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,080
在我们之后吸血鬼来了
The vampires came after us.

453
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:32,447
如果我们的家族团结起来
我们本可以打败他们
And if our families were united,
we could have taken them.

454
00:31:33,989 --> 00:31:34,978
所以我们的父母决定
So, our parents decided

455
00:31:35,157 --> 00:31:37,148
将两个家族合并起来
to bring the two lines
back together.

456
00:31:37,326 --> 00:31:40,955
我们两个就订婚了
And you and I were betrothed.

457
00:31:41,997 --> 00:31:45,660
抱歉，这太荒谬了
I'm sorry.
This is ridiculous.

458
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:46,960
听着，显然事情并没有像
Look, obviously things
didn't work out

459
00:31:47,136 --> 00:31:48,763
大家想的那样发展
the way anyone thought they would.

460
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:51,132
我们狼群犯了个巨大的错误
Our pack made a huge misstep
with the vampires

461
00:31:51,306 --> 00:31:54,867
我们拒绝对吸血鬼妥协
马赛尔就叫女巫给我们下了咒
when we refused to back down.
And Marcel had us cursed by a witch.

462
00:31:56,979 --> 00:31:59,504
你是你家族血脉的最后一人了
安德莉亚
You are the last one
of your bloodline, Andrea.

463
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,615
或是海莉，不管你怎么称呼自己
Or Hayley.
Whatever you call yourself.

464
00:32:06,922 --> 00:32:09,254
这些人会跟随你
These people will follow you.

465
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:12,519
你可以帮助他们
你以及你所代表的
You can help them,
you and what you represent.

466
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:14,685
那到底是什么呢？
And what is that exactly?

467
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:19,766
一切还是不同的时候
我们的族人还在抗争的时候
A time when things were different,
when our people fought back.

468
00:32:21,437 --> 00:32:24,167
你历经艰辛找到我们
And after everything
you went through to find us.

469
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:27,938
你是唯一能打破诅咒的人
You're the one
who's gonna break our curse.

470
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:31,775
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

471
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,041
你的女巫朋友
Your witch friend.

472
00:32:35,217 --> 00:32:36,912
她告诉伊芙她今晚会来
She told Eve
she was coming here tonight

473
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,177
解除我们的咒语
to set us free.

474
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:41,654
等等，什么女巫朋友？
Wait. What witch friend?

475
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:54,393
抱歉
I'm sorry.

476
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,869
我真的很喜欢你
但我跟别人约定好了
I really do like you
but this is the deal we made.

477
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,942
什么约定？跟谁？
What deal? With whom?

478
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:52,989
海莉
Hayley.

479
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:55,595
以利亚，女巫们在谋划着什么
Elijah, something's going on
with the witches.

480
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:59,825
听我说，你说得没错
莎莉丝特回来了
Listen to me. You were right.
Celeste is back.

481
00:34:00,002 --> 00:34:03,096
尼克劳斯、蕾贝卡
你们的处境都很危险
Niklaus, Rebekah.
You're all in danger.

482
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,807
- 怎么回事？
- 这是个陷阱
-What's going on?
-It's a trap.

483
00:34:06,975 --> 00:34:08,943
- 我没跟任何女巫做过约定
- 什么？
-I didn't make a deal with witches.
-What?

484
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:10,806
海莉，你得找到蕾贝卡
Hayley, you have to find Rebekah.

485
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:12,503
在我到之前和她待在一起
And you stay with her
until I get there.

486
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,810
以利亚，这是个咒语
我们被困在屋内了
Elijah, it's a spell.
They're trapping us inside.

487
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:41,842
你知道怎么做
You know what to do.

488
00:34:48,183 --> 00:34:49,775
我们得离开这里
We have to get out of here.

489
00:35:03,532 --> 00:35:04,965
来，透过这个呼吸
Here. Breathe through this.

490
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:27,516
- 蕾贝卡呢？
- 不知道
-Where's Rebekah?
-I don't know.

491
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:30,449
她跟其中一个人出去了
She went off with one of them.

492
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:33,686
以利亚，我朋友还在里面
Elijah, my friend is still in there.

493
00:35:53,415 --> 00:35:54,939
站起来
On your feet.

494
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:07,117
帮帮我
Help me.

495
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,729
好久不见了，蕾贝卡
It's been such a long time, Rebekah.

496
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:15,792
我会好好享受这过程的
I'm going to enjoy this.

497
00:36:29,284 --> 00:36:30,876
丢了什么东西吗？
SABlNE: Missing something?

498
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:35,715
你不会伤害我的
我是唯一活着
You won't hurt me.
I'm the only one alive

499
00:36:35,891 --> 00:36:37,984
能打破海莉家族诅咒的人
who can break the curse
on Hayley's family.

500
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,560
而洁妮薇知道你妹妹在哪
And Genevieve knows
where your sister is.

501
00:36:42,364 --> 00:36:45,561
贝丝蒂娜把克劳斯
藏在一个安全的地方
Bastiana has Klaus
tucked away someplace safe.

502
00:36:45,734 --> 00:36:47,895
顺便说一句，他正在痛苦煎熬
He's suffering horribly,
I might add,

503
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,561
那都是因为你选择去救那只小狼
and all because you chose
to save the little wolf

504
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:51,728
而不是你的家人
instead of your own blood.

505
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:58,279
多么可怕的结局
What a horrific ending...

506
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,415
对你那可悲病态的家族来说
...to your pathetic, diseased family.

507
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:16,496
我想“永远”终究不会是永恒
I guess "always" isn't forever after all.

508
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:22,400
我得走了，月亮
I have to go. The moon.

509
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:23,902
听着，杰克森
Listen, Jackson,

510
00:37:24,072 --> 00:37:27,940
我想谢谢你保护我
不只是今晚
I want to thank you
for protecting me, not just tonight.

511
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,907
我从儿时起就一直幻想着
I've been dreaming
about meeting you,

512
00:37:30,078 --> 00:37:31,067
我们的见面
since I was a kid.

513
00:37:33,148 --> 00:37:35,616
我从没想过会变成这样
I never thought it would go like this.

514
00:37:36,818 --> 00:37:38,649
嘿
Hey...

515
00:37:40,689 --> 00:37:43,021
我会一直寻找
直到找到打破诅咒的方法
...I won't stop until I find a way
to break this curse.

516
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,689
我保证
I promise.

517
00:37:52,868 --> 00:37:55,962
快点，快点，快点接啊
Come on. Come on. Come on.

518
00:37:57,439 --> 00:37:59,464
克劳斯，你在哪？
Klaus, where are you?

519
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:03,771
米卡森先生现在正身体不适
Mr. Mikaelson is currently indisposed.

520
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:06,541
怎么了？你做了什么？
What happened?
What did you do?

521
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:11,015
什么都没做
有人替你完成了你的任务
I did nothing.
Someone completed your task for you.

522
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:13,347
如果你得到了你想要的，那我叔叔…
If you got what you wanted,
then my uncle--

523
00:38:13,522 --> 00:38:15,956
很快就会死去，并且会极其痛苦
Will die soon and in great anguish.

524
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:19,859
你瞧，亲爱的
你没能遵守我们的协定
You see, dear, you failed
to hold up your end of our bargain.

525
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:22,588
你叔叔多次与邪恶为友
You chose instead to side with evil

526
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:25,130
而你也和他一样
as your uncle has done
many times before you.

527
00:38:26,535 --> 00:38:27,524
不过振作点
But take heart.

528
00:38:27,702 --> 00:38:29,499
他的惩罚将会弥补
His punishment will atone

529
00:38:29,671 --> 00:38:31,502
他数次尝试阻止收获祭
for his attempts
to prevent the Harvest.

530
00:38:31,673 --> 00:38:33,937
他的痛苦将会净化他
His suffering will purify him.

531
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:35,838
你吸取他的教训就会做得更好了，孩子
You'd do well
to heed his lesson, girl.

532
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:39,640
与我们作对就是与自然秩序作对
To oppose us
is to oppose the natural order.

533
00:38:39,815 --> 00:38:43,012
无论自愿或被迫
By choice or by force,

534
00:38:43,185 --> 00:38:47,053
法语区的女巫们将再次崛起
the witches of the French Quarter
will rise again.

535
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,353
我们到处都找过了
We looked everywhere for him.

536
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:56,497
把女巫区、墓地都翻遍了
Tore apart the Cauldron,
the City of the Dead.

537
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,724
不管他被抓到哪，一定不在法语区
Wherever they got him,
he ain't in the Quarter.

538
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:00,890
马赛尔！
ELlJAH: Marcel!

539
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,401
我弟弟在哪？
Where is my brother?

540
00:39:03,572 --> 00:39:06,268
我的人正在外面找他
I got guys out looking for him
right now.

541
00:39:11,446 --> 00:39:12,640
以利亚
Elijah.

542
00:39:14,683 --> 00:39:16,708
克劳斯又冲我发脾气了
Klaus threw one
of his classic temper tantrums,

543
00:39:16,885 --> 00:39:19,877
扭断了我的脖子
试图独自一人与一群女巫较量
snapped my neck, tried to take
on a coven of witches by himself.

544
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:21,215
结果被制服了
He got dropped.

545
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:23,482
我不知道他在哪，也不知道怎么找他
I don't know where he is
or how to find him.

546
00:39:23,658 --> 00:39:26,525
她们还抓走了蕾贝卡
They also have Rebekah.

547
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:35,400
在场的每一人都要帮我找到他们
Every one of you will help me
to find them!

548
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,499
我要把她们都杀光
I'm going to kill them all.

549
00:39:46,081 --> 00:39:49,744
- 快点，我们该走了
- 我不想走
-Come on. We have to go.
-I don't wanna go.

550
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:53,418
莫妮克，这没得商量
Monique, this isn't a debate.

551
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:55,385
我刚刚捅了一个真祖
I just stabbed an Original.

552
00:39:55,557 --> 00:39:57,821
他一旦恢复就会杀了我的
He's gonna kill me
as soon as he's recovered.

553
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:04,064
听着
对于这一切我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry for everything.

554
00:40:04,232 --> 00:40:07,793
我应该在那个愚蠢的收获祭前
把你救出来的
I should have come and got you
before that stupid Harvest.

555
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:11,664
但你还是可以拥有正常的生活
But you can still have a normal life.

556
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,972
没有这些疯狂荒诞的女巫事
One without all this crazy witch nonsense.

557
00:40:20,081 --> 00:40:21,776
但我就是女巫
But I am a witch.

558
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:26,049
我不想走
And I don't want to go.

559
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:31,557
莫妮克？
Monique?

560
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:36,724
祖先们说你的信念不坚定
The ancestors said
you didn't have enough faith.

561
00:40:36,898 --> 00:40:38,661
我还希望是他们错了
I was hoping they were wrong.

562
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:40,962
我早该知道的
I should have known better.

563
00:40:46,341 --> 00:40:49,367
- 莫妮克
- 你试图阻止收获祭
-Monique.

564
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:50,738
求你不要这么做
Please don't do this.

565
00:40:50,912 --> 00:40:53,403
现在我们该留下来战斗时，你却想逃走
Now you want to run
when we need to stay and fight.

别这样，求求你，不要，不要
Please. I'm begging you, don't--
Don't--

我们四个人，我们死而后生时
The four of us, when we return,

568
00:40:57,352 --> 00:41:00,014
就有足够的力量除掉城里的吸血鬼

to rid the city of vampires

00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,450
我们会杀死每一个
and we'll kill anyone...

570
00:41:03,892 --> 00:41:05,450
信念不坚定的人
...who doesn't keep the faith.

- 莫妮克，求求你
- 你应该相信的
-Monique, please.
-You should have believed.
