00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:02,380
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,251
<i>Mike's therapy hit a snag.

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,830
Keep telling you, I don't remember.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,190
Something happened at that movie.

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,243
Who did you see it with?

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,317
Probably Susan.

7
00:00:09,356 --> 00:00:10,360
Why not ask her about it?

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,100
- Mike, it wasn't a movie that was us.
- What?

9
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,470
That was the first night that
we spent together.

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,230
I saw you watching us.

11
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,830
We were just talking.

12
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,781
<i>Gaby saw another side of Victor.

13
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,999
I didn't marry an angry woman.
I just divorced one.

14
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,443
And I set her up in a nice house,

15
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,850
And I gave her an allowance, and
then I came and went as I pleased.

16
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,310
I've known you for two weeks,

17
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,100
And this is the first glimpse of
a guy could actually like.

18
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,195
<i>Tom's back put him out of commission.

19
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,390
It'll be a while
before he's back on his feet.

20
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,530
How much of a while?

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,798
- Three months.
- <i>And Edie

22
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:40,361
<i>bared more her soul for Carlos.

23
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:43,620
I'm here,
and I'm asking for a chance.

24
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:52,810
<i>Edie Britt had always thought
of herself as passionate...

25
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,020
<i>aggressively...

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,410
<i>relentlessly...

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,980
<i>violently passionate.

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,410
<i>Carlos solis had always thought
of himself as passionate

29
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,690
<i>romantically...

30
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,610
<i>spontaneously...

31
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,010
<i>constantly passionate.

32
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,450
<i>So it was natural for Eddie and Carlos
to assume that if they ever had sex,

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,970
<i>it would be amazing.

34
00:01:21,341 --> 00:01:23,053
<i>And, in fact, it was...

35
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,278
<i>amazingly...

36
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:27,650
<i>bad.

37
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,410
- Morning.
- Morning.

38
00:01:32,284 --> 00:01:34,548
So, uh, last night...

39
00:01:34,666 --> 00:01:36,050
yeah, I know.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,486
Super wow.

41
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,210
Is that clock right?

42
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,212
Oh, man, I gotta get  work.

43
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah! I gotta get home.

44
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,154
So, uh...
oh, we should do this again.

45
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,330
Oh, definitely.

46
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,630
Yeah, this week doesn't seem
to be that great.

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,060
- Maybe...
- Next week, I'm swamped.

48
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:06,060
Well, we'll figure something out.

49
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:11,399
<i>It was at that moment Eddie and Carlos
had the exact same thought...

50
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:16,100
thank you.

51
00:02:18,402 --> 00:02:19,510
Thank you.

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,940
<i>they would definitely
be having sex again...

53
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:25,232
<i>just not.

54
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,050

<i>"Liaisons"

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,113
<i>It's so easy to spot the lonely ones.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,220
It wasn't the first time...

62
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,260
<i>they're the peop who tell stories
to their plants...

63
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,492
I kind of like him.

64
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:23,924
<i>and whisper secrets to their pets

65
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,172
...ask him to be
my boyfriend if he wants.

66
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,160
- <i>and have arguments with their tv.</i>
- Get him off the court!

67
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:31,463
He was runing like his feet
are made out of lead!

68
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,140
<i>and the loneliest of all are the ones
who talk to people...

69
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:36,970
do you know what I think, Gilbert?

70
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,719
<i>people who are no longer there.

71
00:03:39,847 --> 00:03:41,570
Phone's gonna ring any second.

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,100
It's gonna be Lynette begging me
to come over early.

73
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,919
Did I tell you that Tom had surgery
on his back last week?

74
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,179
That idiot's flat on his ass while
Lynette brings home the bacon again.

75
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,235
Eh, I shouldn't judge.

76
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,037
Plenty of people didn't get
what I saw in you.

77
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,022
I won't name names...

78
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,020
my sister gayle.

79
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,240
I always told her that beneath
all the name-Calling

80
00:04:08,358 --> 00:04:11,736
And the dish-Throwing we really
loved each other.

81
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,380
Betcha 50 bucks it's Lynette.

82
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,603
Hello?

83
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,702
You lose, Gilbert.

84
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,840
What's up?

85
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,473
I have to get to the restaurant early.

86
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:26,480
Is there any you could come over
and get the kids off to school?

87
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,567
Why am I seeing pajamas?

88
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:28,650
Get dressed!

89
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,040
Yeah, they are ready to go.

90
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,606
So what  you say?

91
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,870
Oh, great! Thanks.

92
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,056
I owe you big-Time.

93
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:38,152
All right, I am heading out of here.

94
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:39,230
Wish me luck.

95
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,498
Re interviews this morning?

96
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,770
Yeah, but don't worry.

97
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,850
I am gonna find you
the assistant manager of your dreams.

98
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,690
Are you sure? Because the last
ten résumés you showed me...

99
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,310
yeah, I know, I know.

100
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,180
Bottom of the barrel,
convicts and losers.

101
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,830
You were clear
about that last night.

102
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,576
And make sure that they really know
how to wrangle the employees.

103
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,530
Like kim... she never
buses her tables.

104
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm the one that told you that.

105
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,239
Oh. Yeah, right.

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,146
Hey, honey, I had an idea
about he specials for today.

107
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,647
I was thinking goat cheese
and mushrooms.

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
Oh, for God sake, Tom!

109
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:13,580
I'm gonna be late for this interview.

110
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:14,690
I really should go.

111
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,910
Honey, I'm sorry.

112
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,930
- I know I am driving you crazy.
- No.

113
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,570
It's just that I'm feeling so guilty
laying here, totally worthless,

114
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,690
While you run the restaurant
and the house.

115
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,961
It's okay. I am gonna find a way
to make this all work,

116
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,580
And you just get better.

117
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,800
Mrs. Mccluskey.

118
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,030
Perfect timing.

119
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,460
Hey, make sure you have
your cell phone with you.

120
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,940
Then while you're interviewing,
I'll call, you can conference me in.

121
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,150
That is a great idea!

122
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,770
- Hi!
- Hi.

123
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,108
At some point, Tom's gonna
ask you to look for this.

124
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,686
You will not find it.

125
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,846
Great.

126
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,113
Love you!

127
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,864
Here's your beer.

128
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,027
Oh! Good job, chipmunk.

129
00:06:00,158 --> 00:06:01,590
No foam this time.

130
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,110
I tipped the glass just
like you told me to.

131
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,815
I think someone's read to salt
his first margarita glass.

132
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,190
Mommy,do you have trouble
going to sleep?

133
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,473
Why do you ask?

134
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,160
'Cause I heard Carlos
say you were bad in bed.

135
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,015
What?!

136
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,530
Why'd he say that?

137
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,900
Do you have nightmares?

138
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,756
Okay, sweetie,
I need you to focus.

139
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,298
What exactly did Carlos say,
and who did he say it to?

140
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:34,320
I went to get my soccer
ball from his yard.

141
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,429
He was on the one
talking to someone.

142
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,380
So what does "bad in bed" mean?

143
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,799
Well, it means that
you're not good at making...

144
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,758
your bed.

145
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,097
And mommy doesn't like people saying
she can't make a bed because...

146
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,930
trust me, nobody makes a bed
as good as your mommy.

147
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,910
If you want, I can tell people
you're good in bed.

148
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,080
That's fine, sweetie.

149
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,830
Uh, if you want to help mommy,
just, um...

150
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:11,107
top off her breakfast.

151
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,239
Susan, I'm, uh, by the orange stand.

152
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,640
Where are you?

153
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
The cheese stand?

154
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,718
No, I don't mind you going back
for free samples.

155
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,832
But if you like it so much,
why don't you just buy some?

156
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,990
Yeah, of course, you're right.

157
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,260
It always tastes better
when it's free.

158
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,360
Okay, then please hurry.

159
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:40,397
Hello.

160
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,540
Boy, you're everywhere these days

161
00:07:46,837 --> 00:07:47,869
Excuse me?

162
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:50,544
Well, yesterday, Susan and I
ran into you at the post office.

163
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,710
Last week, the movies.

164
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,850
One might think you're following us.

165
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:58,330
Trust me,one better things to do
than follow you around.

166
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,660
And yet here you are... again.

167
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,430
Ian, fairview's a small town.

168
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,170
You want distance?

169
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,940
Move to the city.

170
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:19,963
You've been awfully quiet
since we left the market.

171
00:08:20,116 --> 00:08:21,740
Is everything okay?

172
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,606
Well, since you ask, I'm having
some problems at work.

173
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:28,137
Really?

174
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,279
Yes, we're in the midst of
some corporate restructuring.

175
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,273
I'm gonna have to spend
more time in london.

176
00:08:40,494 --> 00:08:44,242
And I was thinking,
maybe you and I should just...

177
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:46,093
relocate.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,570
To london?

179
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,855
Permanently?

180
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,680
- I know it's sudden, but...
- Yeah, it's sudden.

181
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,934
My whole life is here.
I mean, my friends.

182
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,103
You know, julie is still in school...

183
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,280
oh, my God.

184
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,530
Are you okay?

185
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,304
I'm fine. I'm fine.

186
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,007
I can feel the car sinking.

187
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,450
We're gonna
have to get to shore.

188
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,050
How deep do you think
this water is?

189
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,580
Deep enough.

190
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,330
Come on! Let's move!

191
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,176
I can't swim.

192
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,800
What?!

193
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,760
You said you played water polo!

194
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,130
I said polo with horses!

195
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,680
How can you not know how to swim?

196
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:52,391
Didn't you go to summer camp?

197
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:54,778
I stayed in the canoe.
Let it go!

198
00:09:55,047 --> 00:09:56,795
Okay, don't panic.

199
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,937
Just grab onto my neck,
and I'll swim for the both of us.

200
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,094
I'm twice your size.

201
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,330
We might drown.

202
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,230
Let's just stay here
and think of something else.

203
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,620
If you stay here,
you'll definitely drown.

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,630
You see how my plan is better?

205
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,300
Look, there's somebody
on the shore!

206
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,332
It's Mike! He's here.

207
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,181
Of course he is.

208
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,600
I can walk from here!

209
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,310
Sorry. You were just
gripping me so tight.

210
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,470
Oh, my God.

211
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,580
Mike, you sad our lives.

212
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,554
And our cheese!

213
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,870
Ian, can you believe it?

214
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,066
Mike saved our cheese!

215
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,343
Yes, he's...
he's quite the hero.

216
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,510
Good thing
I was following you.

217
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,047
Arnie, thanks for coming in.

218
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,849
We will definitely
keep you in mind.

219
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,149
Come on.

220
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,381
What was wrong
with that guy?

221
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,459
He kept asking what we do
with the food people don't eat.

222
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,591
All right,
so he's a fat loser. I mean,

223
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,912
Who'd you expect
to get for $8.50 an hour?

224
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,472
Well, that's what we pay you,
and you seem happy enough.

225
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,419
That's because I'm doing
the beer delivery guy.

226
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,528
My fault for asking.

227
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,939
Rick Coletti?

228
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,565
- That's me.
- Great.

229
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:51,082
Come on over.

230
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,046
Your application?

231
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,882
One second

232
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:59,492
<i>cheese calzone<i>

233
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,484
That's been bothering me. Sorry.

234
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:05,423
No. It's great you can spell.
You are now officially the front-Runner.

235
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:07,621
Yeah, my, uh, grandma
came over from naples.

236
00:12:07,878 --> 00:12:10,764
I've been making calzones
since before you were born.

237
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,719
How old do you think I am?

238
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,640
30? 31?

239
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,240
Not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss.
You are doing very well.

240
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:23,283
Great you wanna skip ahead
to the part where you hire me?

241
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,855
Well, I should probably take a look
at your application first.

242
00:12:29,491 --> 00:12:31,960
Okay, don't be afraid if you
don't have a ton of experience.

243
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:35,145
I realize for what we're paying,
we're not exactly gonna get a...

244
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,250
you were a sous-Chef
at cucina?

245
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,757
That's a five-Star restaurant.

246
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,233
Actually four.

247
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,898
Which is four more thane have

248
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,960
Yeah, but this place his
character and charm, and...

249
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,161
a beautiful owner.

250
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:54,512
But seriously,

251
00:12:54,676 --> 00:12:57,649
Why would a four-Star chef
wanna slum at a pizza joint?

252
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,013
Mrs. Mccskey!

253
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,131
I'm right here!
Keep your shirt on.

254
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,770
I need another pill. And please,
tell the kids to turn down the tv.

255
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,865
I yell, they turn it down. I walk away,
they turn it up. Vicious circle.

256
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,033
Surely you can control
five little kids.

257
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,200
- Can I beat 'em?
- No.

258
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,750
Then my hands are tied.

259
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,600
Hi! I'm home! And I've got good news.
I found a new manager.

260
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,855
- That's terrific.
- Yeah, his name is Rick Coletti,

261
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,715
And he was a sous-Chef at cucina.

262
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,971
Cucina? Why does he wanna
work at our place?

263
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,080
Yeah, I had that exact same thought.
And to be honest, he has a history.

264
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,450
History?

265
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:45,510
You know how stressful it is working
in a four-Star restaurant,

266
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,873
And he, like many chefs, started
using cocaine just to stay ahead...

267
00:13:49,102 --> 00:13:50,149
no way.

268
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,922
- Clean for almost a year.
- We're not the betty ford clinic!

269
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:55,542
No, I know, but I've got a really good
feeling about this guy,

270
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:57,090
And all he wants is a fresh start.

271
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:59,885
I am not gonna hire a junkie
who's gonna turn around and...

272
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:02,566
and then hock our jukebox
just to feed his habit.

273
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,266
Here, go find somebody else.

274
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,534
I can't find somebody else.
I've interviewed 50 guys,

275
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,137
And this junkie happens to be
the best of the bunch.

276
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:12,486
Seriously, Tom, I don't know
how much longer I...

277
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:16,597
please, can we just talk about this
later? I'm in a lot of pain right now.

278
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,506
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,600
Please, just.

280
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,410
Do what I am asking.

281
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,083
Fine.

282
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,523
I'll, uh, keep looking.

283
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,207
I had such a good time tonight.
Who knew you could dance?

284
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,050
It's of my many  talents.

285
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,249
I'll tell you what. You invite me in for
a drink, I'll show you another one.

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,209
Not tonight, thanks.

287
00:14:42,396 --> 00:14:45,117
So you would tango with a mad
and then not he sex with him?

288
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,670
You know that's actually
against the law in argentina.

289
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,164
Come on. We both know
it's gonna happen eventually.

290
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,360
And every time you say that,
"eventually" gets a little further away.

291
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,821
Stop begging, or I'm not going
to your rally tomorrow.

292
00:14:57,014 --> 00:14:58,761
Fine. I can be patient.

293
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,353
As far as I'm concerned,
the chase is half the fun.

294
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,791
Half the fun?

295
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,250
Oh, honey, if I ever do say yes...

296
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,140
you're gonna adjust
that percentage way down.

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,010
You can't possibly
be eating more cheese.

298
00:15:29,251 --> 00:15:31,800
What, you've never heard
of a midnight snack?

299
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,430
Unless you can think of something else
that I can nibble on.

300
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:42,600
Slide over, you cheddar-Breath tease.

301
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,037
Oh, what's that?

302
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,633
It's a thank you gift for Mike.

303
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:59,365
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't
we already thank him at the shore,

304
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,294
And again when
he dropped us off at home?

305
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,824
I don't think you can really thank
somebody too many times

306
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:06,226
For saving your life.

307
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,366
- I wish you'd stop saying that.
- Saying what?

308
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,702
That he saved my life.

309
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,106
I'm fairly certain I could've
survived without his help.

310
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,459
And if anyone did
any lifesaving, it was me.

311
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:15,766
- You?
- Yes.

312
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,034
If hadn't warned you about the deer,

313
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:20,270
It would've gone straight
through the windshield,

314
00:16:20,368 --> 00:16:23,716
And you would've ended up with
an antler through your brain.

315
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,415
Okay, that's a good point.

316
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,990
Thank you.

317
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,760
But we were
in a bit of a jam there, and...

318
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,668
I don't think you should be embarrassed
for needing a little help.

319
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,901
I'm not embarrassed, and I don't
feel emasculated, either.

320
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,732
Emasculated?
Who said emasculated?

321
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,700
And why are you
not kissing me now?

322
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,464
I'm ready when you are.

323
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,860
I guess we're gonna
cut right to the...

324
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,610
don't worry.
Happens to everybody.

325
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:28,295
- Maybe it would help to talk about it.
- No.

326
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,680
I don't want to talk about it.

327
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,813
All right.

328
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,427
We won't talk about it.

329
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,830
Want some cheese?

330
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,796
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.

331
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,010
Well, you might not think so,
but... I am good.

332
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,739
Where in the hell do you get off
telling people that I am bad in bed?!

333
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,076
- I never said that!
- Travers heard you on the phone!

334
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,557
Okay, I'm sorry. I was talking
to my cousin in tucson,

335
00:18:10,753 --> 00:18:12,904
And we always trade bad date stories.

336
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,339
And to think that I went out of
my way to spare your feelings?

337
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,200
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You think you were bored?

338
00:18:21,586 --> 00:18:24,306
I've had more thrills
leaning up against my dryer.

339
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:27,524
- Then what was all that moaning?
- I was in pain!

340
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,541
- You were smashing my breasts!
- Oh, come on!

341
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,872
You hunkered down on top of me like
you were hiding from the border patrol.

342
00:18:34,158 --> 00:18:36,878
I was tired. You just laid there
while I did all the work.

343
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,272
When we were done, I felt like
I should deflate you.

344
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,607
Well, sex is like tennis

345
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:44,915
When you play an inferior opponent,
your game suffers.

346
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,342
Are you challenging me
to a rematch?

347
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:53,659
Maybe.

348
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,599
So you wanna do it again?

349
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,264
If it'll shut you up...

350
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,183
I'll fall on that grenade.

351
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,195
There's gonna be
an explosion. Come on.

352
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,436
I'm prescribing a mild painkiller
for your back,

353
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,391
And I will see you in a week
to remove those stitches.

354
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,586
Great.

355
00:19:26,721 --> 00:19:29,589
So... how'd you folks get
so banged up?

356
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,200
Car accident?

357
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,954
Bad sex.

358
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,590
Really bad.

359
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:42,961
Thanks.

360
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,537
God, what a disaster.

361
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,170
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe it's for the best.

362
00:19:52,343 --> 00:19:53,520
How so?

363
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,559
We got it out of our system. Now we can
go back to being friends. I mean,

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,112
We like hanging out,
and Travers adores you.

365
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,098
Yeah, and I wouldn't wanna ruin that.
Still, it doesn't make any sense.

366
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,035
Oh, I know.

367
00:20:08,232 --> 00:20:13,759
I'm hot. You're hot. On paper,
we should be having great sex.

368
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,250
Well, we could always try again.

369
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,832
Yeah, me neither.

370
00:20:23,996 --> 00:20:26,896
This town is hungry for change...

371
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,900
<i>When Gabrielle solis agreed to attend

372
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,806
<i>Victor Lang's campaign rally,</i>

373
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:35,158
<i>she was fully prepared to be bored.</i>

374
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,366
I give you the next mayor of Fairview--

375
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:43,776
<i>But when Victor took the stage,</i>

376
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,416
<i>Gabrielle found herself</i>
<i>strangely enthralled.</i>

377
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:51,402
<i>Perhaps it was the cheers
that greeted his arrival.</i>

378
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:56,799
<i>Perhaps it was the confidence he exuded.</i>

379
00:20:58,918 --> 00:21:01,695
<i>Or perhaps it was the effect he had</i>

380
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,770
<i>on the citizens of Fairview.</i>

381
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,000
<i>Whatever the reason,</i>

382
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,370
<i>Gaby decided</i>

383
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:10,976
<i>not only did Victor Lang
have her vote...</i>

384
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:17,205
It was time to make
a campaign contribution.</i>

385
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,805
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

386
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,900
Sure.

387
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,400
Excuse me. Sorry.

388
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,625
I'm afraid mr. Lang has to take

389
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:28,957
An important meeting
in his limo...

390
00:21:29,642 --> 00:21:30,675
now.

391
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,851
To the radio station, Clyde.

392
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,400
So what's all this about?

393
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:40,998
Your speech--
I liked it.

394
00:21:44,813 --> 00:21:46,398
Seriously, here?

395
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,010
Now?

396
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:50,538
Well, you laid out
all your positions.

397
00:21:51,374 --> 00:21:53,934
Don't you want
to get acquainted with mine?

398
00:21:57,226 --> 00:21:59,222
Clyde, could you put up
the partition, please?

399
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,980
Yes, sir. Anything else?

400
00:22:01,134 --> 00:22:03,494
Music. Loud music.

401
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:19,401
Mrs. Mccluskey,
it has been ten minutes!

402
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,714
Where's my pie?!

403
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,423
I'm unloading the dishwasher.

404
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,514
You'll get your damn pie
when I'm done.

405
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,321
I want my pie now.

406
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,956
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you heard me.

407
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,027
Your being here
isn't charity.

408
00:22:42,144 --> 00:22:43,588
We pay you good money
to help us.

409
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:46,466
So when I ask you to do
something, I want it done!

410
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:52,088
Well, here's a surprise
for you...

411
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:54,191
I quit.

412
00:22:54,826 --> 00:22:57,325
What? What? Why? Why?
What happened?

413
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:00,852
Five kids are tough enough,
but your husband makes six,

414
00:23:00,981 --> 00:23:02,390
And that's where
I draw the line.

415
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:05,277
Okay, I know that, uh, Tom
has been a little cranky lately.

416
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:07,162
No, I'm cranky.
He's insufferable.

417
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:09,233
I hate to admit this, Lynette,

418
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:11,536
But every time
that man screams out in pain,

419
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:14,327
- I do a little jig inside.
- Look, I'll talk to Tom--

420
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:16,223
- No, my mind's made up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

421
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,706
Please don't do this. Please.
I am at the end of my rope.

422
00:23:18,824 --> 00:23:20,538
I wish I could help you, Lynette.

423
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,158
I can see that you're going down,

424
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:25,106
But I'm just too old to get
dragged down with you.

425
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,842
Oh, it's cold!

426
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:38,808
Okay, everybody,
go on up to bed.

427
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,618
Parker, you got the baby.

428
00:23:41,182 --> 00:23:44,212
Yeah, that's exactly right.
You know what to do.

429
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:47,827
Before you speak,

430
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,914
Just know that
ever since mccluskey left,

431
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:51,077
I've been lying here

432
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:53,695
Feeling like
the biggest jerk ever.

433
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,873
Tomorrow morning, I am gonna
call her and apologize.

434
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:01,008
I will fix this.

435
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:06,665
Well, you might
also want to apologize

436
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:09,596
To the custor who found
a Lego in her pizza.

437
00:24:10,647 --> 00:24:12,537
Oh, God.
Did the kids do that?

438
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,471
I hope.

439
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:15,889
Oh, God.

440
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,442
It was so awful tonight.

441
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,202
Oh, honey.

442
00:24:21,864 --> 00:24:23,684
You know what you need?

443
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,554
What?

444
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,468
A seein' to.

445
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:32,992
Once the kids are asleep,

446
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:35,928
Slip on that sexy blue thing

447
00:24:36,418 --> 00:24:38,665
And then sneak back down here.

448
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,132
You wanna have sex?
But you're immobile.

449
00:24:44,342 --> 00:24:47,211
Okay, maybe full-On sex
is a little ambitious,

450
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:51,280
But there's other stuff
that we could do...

451
00:24:52,903 --> 00:24:54,582
but you can't bend at the waist,

452
00:24:54,688 --> 00:24:58,498
And that pretty much
leaves the heavy lifting to me.

453
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:01,437
Trust me, if you get us
to the finish line,

454
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:04,056
I will cross it.

455
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:10,252
Is that why you apologized,
just so I'd... service you?

456
00:25:10,358 --> 00:25:12,894
Honey, I have been trapped
in this bed all day long.

457
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:14,732
I'm bored. I'm miserable.

458
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:17,362
Can't you do this
one little thing for me?

459
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,653
I have been doing
everything I can

460
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:23,425
To keep our heads
above water.

461
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,245
I can't do you, too.

462
00:25:31,879 --> 00:25:32,969
<i>For Gabrielle,

463
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:35,610
<i>the best part of having sex
with a new man</i>

464
00:25:35,716 --> 00:25:36,914
<i>was seeing how quickly</i>

465
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:39,603
<i>his affection would turn
to obsession.</i>

466
00:25:40,037 --> 00:25:41,305
<i>No messages.</i>

467
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:45,262
<i>But when Victor failed to call
the next morning...</i>

468
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:46,893
<i>No messages.</i>

469
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,811
<i>Or the next afternoon...</i>

470
00:25:52,001 --> 00:25:53,128
<i>No messages.</i>

471
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:56,136
<i>It was Gabrielle who began obsessing.</i>

472
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:59,398
Not a peep. 24 hours.

473
00:25:59,563 --> 00:26:02,000
Well, he's busy. Isn't he
debating the mayor tonight?

474
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:04,537
I don't care! He can find
two lousy minutes for me.

475
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:06,142
I'm here!

476
00:26:06,623 --> 00:26:07,691
Deal me in.

477
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:10,401
Sorry, no poker today.
Lynette had to work.

478
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:11,938
Want a margarita?

479
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,258
Oh, I'd like three,
but I'll start with one.

480
00:26:14,816 --> 00:26:16,689
Ms. Solis?
Sorry to interrupt.

481
00:26:16,877 --> 00:26:19,413
- You have any water?
- Yeah, in the fridge.

482
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,438
Who is that?

483
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:31,339
And why don't you put your water
on that lower shelf?

484
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:33,812
Thank you.

485
00:26:34,501 --> 00:26:36,574
That's Toby. He's fixing my closet.

486
00:26:36,688 --> 00:26:39,643
Has your cocky boyfriend
gotten a load of the help?

487
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,273
- Move away om that topic.
- We had sex yesterday in his limo.

488
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:46,379
Ooh, I love limo sex.
Town car or stretch?

489
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:48,875
Well, stretch, of course.
I'm not a complete slut.

490
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:51,915
Point is, he hasn't called since.

491
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,417
So... how was the sex?

492
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,266
Fantastic.
As good as with Carlos.

493
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,655
Hmm. That good, huh?

494
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:04,280
God, I'm such an idiot.
I gave it up way too fast.

495
00:27:04,446 --> 00:27:06,876
- Now I've lost all the power.
- Oh, come on.

496
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:09,507
No, I'm serious.
Our mothers had the right idea.

497
00:27:09,708 --> 00:27:12,150
They let men think they were
the only ones who needed sex,

498
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,076
And women just went along as a favor.

499
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,684
Men begged for every crumb,

500
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:17,375
And we never lost the upper hand.

501
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,863
Yeah, no guy respects
an easy conquest.

502
00:27:20,457 --> 00:27:22,300
I make all my men wait.

503
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:26,370
It's true. She has a little room
with magazines and an aquarium.

504
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,271
I have so missed our friendship.

505
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,428
I think if you really like this guy,

506
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,913
You should just be honest.

507
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,076
You should tell him
that you feel a little hurt--

508
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:40,320
Oh, yeah, whining is really
gonna bring him to his knees.

509
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,400
You wanna get this guy
back in line?

510
00:27:42,638 --> 00:27:45,803
You hit him hard, hit him fast.
Is he the jealous type?

511
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:47,860
Aren't they all?

512
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:51,701
So what should I do
to make him jealous?

513
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,611
I got all the shelves up.

514
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:55,338
Anything else?

515
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:05,444
My opponent thinks
we should combat prostitution

516
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:08,902
By mounting surveillance cameras
to embarrass the customers.

517
00:28:09,537 --> 00:28:13,406
I call that a blatant violation
of our citizens' privacy.

518
00:28:13,582 --> 00:28:15,614
Mr. Mayor, if you're
so worried about privacy,

519
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,001
Just wear a hat, keep your head
down, and you'll be fine.

520
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:22,526
Okay, thank you very much, gentlemen.

521
00:28:22,887 --> 00:28:25,258
So let's move on
to our next subject.

522
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,545
You both have said our citizens
pay too much in taxes.

523
00:28:29,677 --> 00:28:31,568
How would you
attract new business

524
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,700
To boost the city's tax base?

525
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:36,752
Mr. Lang?

526
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,228
I'm sorry, would you, uh...

527
00:28:42,615 --> 00:28:44,563
uh, repeat the question, please?

528
00:28:45,244 --> 00:28:47,810
How would you bring
new business to fairview?

529
00:28:49,609 --> 00:28:51,088
I would, uh...

530
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:55,010
offer tax exemptions
to, uh, first-Year start-Ups.

531
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:56,861
And that will...

532
00:28:57,327 --> 00:28:59,396
increase our tax base?

533
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,275
Uh, no. Of course not.

534
00:29:01,571 --> 00:29:03,908
Not at first. But when conjoined with...

535
00:29:08,377 --> 00:29:11,254
my opponent seems
a bit overtaxed himself.

536
00:29:16,534 --> 00:29:18,413
Gentlemen, there's been much talk lately

537
00:29:18,554 --> 00:29:20,474
Regarding our local schools.

538
00:29:21,381 --> 00:29:24,504
What would you do
to improve public education?

539
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,037
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.

540
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:34,782
- Miss! Please?
- I will be right there!

541
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:39,790
Oh, my God! Mrs. Scavo,
I am so sorry.

542
00:29:39,896 --> 00:29:41,277
Don't cry. Just clean.

543
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:42,580
Miss, if you could just--

544
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,764
I swear, I will be there in one second.

545
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,609
Here you go. Here you go.

546
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:51,330
Let me guess. This a bad time?

547
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,640
Oh, my God, Rick. I never
got back to you. I am so sorry.

548
00:29:54,805 --> 00:29:56,332
That's okay.
I didn't mind waiting.

549
00:29:56,481 --> 00:29:58,735
So long as it's good news
for me now.

550
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:01,143
Look, I think you're great,

551
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,221
And we would be lucky
to have you.

552
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:07,020
It's just, my husband
isn't really comfortable--

553
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,388
With an ex-Drug addict
in his kitchen.

554
00:30:10,111 --> 00:30:13,752
You can drug test me every week.
Anything you want.

555
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:17,299
I just... I really need this job.

556
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,923
Miss!

557
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:23,731
Could you excuse me a second?

558
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:26,828
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
what's up?

559
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,836
- I hate my calzone.
- Oh? What's wrong with it?

560
00:30:30,082 --> 00:30:32,228
It's just not good,
and I want a new one.

561
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,326
All right, all right.
I will put you order in.

562
00:30:34,444 --> 00:30:37,230
- But the kitchen's a little backed up.
- Not my problem.

563
00:30:37,477 --> 00:30:39,488
You gave me
a sucky calzone.

564
00:30:39,676 --> 00:30:43,365
I don't care if you have to get
back there and make it yourself!

565
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,080
I can't do this.

566
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,691
It's just...

567
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:08,227
what is this?

568
00:31:09,992 --> 00:31:11,624
I'll make you a new calzone, sir.

569
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,326
Uh, fresh basil, garlic...

570
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:16,158
- you like sun-Dried tomatoes?
- Yeah, sounds good.

571
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:17,342
All right.

572
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,695
Is she all right?

573
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:23,107
Yeah. It's her grandma's
calzone recipe.

574
00:31:23,224 --> 00:31:25,770
She takes criticism very personally.

575
00:31:27,972 --> 00:31:29,863
Prep some dough
for a calzone for me,

576
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,830
And, uh, can you get someone
to chop some basil?

577
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:35,356
Yeah, okay.
Who are you?

578
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,360
I'm Rick.

579
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,610
You--You--
You work here now?

580
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,261
Looks like I do.

581
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,352
- Oh, is that new?
- I just bought it.

582
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,679
But if you don't like it,
feel free to rip it off me.

583
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:04,635
Actually, I have this book
proposal to discuss

584
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:07,113
At an 8:00 a.M. Meeting,
so I-I can't really...

585
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:09,649
well, that's okay.
You gotta work, you gotta work.

586
00:32:12,421 --> 00:32:16,037
So, um... I was
thinking about London.

587
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,102
Julie's gonna be
applying to college as soon,

588
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:27,251
And, um, a year abroad
could give her a real boost.

589
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:30,400
So... let's do it.

590
00:32:31,372 --> 00:32:32,758
Are you serious?

591
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:36,628
Yes. I wanna spend time
in your world.

592
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:39,973
I wanna play cricket,
and I wanna eat crumpets,

593
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:42,259
And I want to use the word...
"ghastly."

594
00:32:43,902 --> 00:32:46,058
God, Susan, you have no idea

595
00:32:46,222 --> 00:32:48,934
How excited this makes me feel.

596
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:52,149
My thigh's getting an inkling.

597
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:54,339
We'll call a realtor
first thing in the morning

598
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:56,065
And put our houses on the market.

599
00:32:56,242 --> 00:32:58,482
Mine, okay? That way,
we can use it when we visit.

600
00:32:58,686 --> 00:33:01,516
- That's what hotels are for, darling.
- I don't want sell my house.

601
00:33:01,616 --> 00:33:04,000
Everybody I love is on this street.

602
00:33:08,805 --> 00:33:09,838
What happened?

603
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:11,411
I'm feeling tired.

604
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:14,613
You weren't tired a second ago.

605
00:33:14,719 --> 00:33:16,429
I'm not in the mood, all right?

606
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:18,918
Why not?

607
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:21,688
You know, I'm not used to being
grilled about my sex drive.

608
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:24,272
Well, I'm not used to guys bailing on me

609
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,713
In the middle of foreplay.

610
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:28,296
And by "guys,"
of course you mean Mike.

611
00:33:28,437 --> 00:33:29,470
What?

612
00:33:29,623 --> 00:33:32,913
Oh, I'm sure good old Mike
was ready and able 24/7.

613
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,668
You're not actually...

614
00:33:38,236 --> 00:33:39,953
okay. That's it...

615
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:42,818
I've had it.

616
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:44,330
Really,

617
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:46,831
I can't have this conversation
one more time.

618
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:49,466
I've done nothing
but prove my love to you

619
00:33:49,595 --> 00:33:50,616
For the last year,

620
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,200
And you cannot shut up
about Mike.

621
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,850
- I don't trust the man!
- Well, you don't have to trust Mike!

622
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:57,069
You have to trust me,
and you don't!

623
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:02,026
That's what going to england's
about, isn't it?

624
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,370
You're just trying
to get me away from Mike.

625
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:06,978
Well, you know what?
Screw it. I'm not going.

626
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:09,329
And if you ever bring up
his name again, we're over.

627
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:10,633
Got it? Over!

628
00:34:35,695 --> 00:34:36,764
Hi.

629
00:34:37,715 --> 00:34:39,445
This is from me and Ian.

630
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,933
An electric juicer.

631
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:48,567
Yeah, well, you know, you try
to think of a more appropriate

632
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,874
"Thank you for saving my life" gift.

633
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,827
This works fine for me.

634
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:58,673
Good.

635
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,190
I should go.

636
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:10,355
You okay?

637
00:35:15,161 --> 00:35:16,535
I'm good.

638
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,570
You sure about that?

639
00:35:23,775 --> 00:35:25,572
Yeah, it's just, um...

640
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,797
you know, Ian and I
had a had a little...

641
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:33,662
thing.

642
00:35:59,427 --> 00:36:00,448
Hi.

643
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:02,573
Hi.

644
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:08,530
Ian, about what I said--

645
00:36:08,621 --> 00:36:09,948
You were right.

646
00:36:10,899 --> 00:36:13,527
You've never given me
reason to doubt you.

647
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,963
I'm an insecure idiot.

648
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,089
I don't deserve you, Susan.

649
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:22,790
But if you'll please
keep pretending that I do,

650
00:36:22,884 --> 00:36:26,116
I swear I will not utter
a single jealous word

651
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:28,750
For the rest of our lives together.

652
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:51,719
<i>Gaby, it's Victor.</i>

653
00:36:51,813 --> 00:36:53,128
<i>What the hell were you thinking?</i>

654
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,899
<i>That little stunt of yours
almost cost me the debate.</i>

655
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:02,631
<i>It's me again. Okay, I get it.</i>

656
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:04,552
<i>I forgot to call,
and you were mad.</i>

657
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:05,902
<i>But still, you--</i>

658
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:12,923
<i>Hi. I hope you got the flowers.</i>

659
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:15,260
<i>Again, I am so sorry for not calling--</i>

660
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:23,958
<i>Gaby, come on. What's it gonna
take for you to forgive me?</i>

661
00:37:24,123 --> 00:37:26,319
<i>I'll do anything you want--</i>

662
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,717
I brought you some flowers...

663
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,897
in case the other
three bouquets get lonely.

664
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:39,080
Thank you. You can go now.

665
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,593
I don't want to take any more
time out of your busy schedule.

666
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:42,709
For God sake, Gaby,

667
00:37:42,867 --> 00:37:45,227
How many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

668
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:47,675
What I did was thoughtless
and inconsiderate.

669
00:37:47,742 --> 00:37:48,751
Yes, it was.

670
00:37:48,775 --> 00:37:51,741
- What you did was flat-Out vicious.
- Just trying to get your attention.

671
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,901
- By humiliating me in public?
- Hey, you hurt me.

672
00:37:53,913 --> 00:37:55,968
If I have to strike back hard
to protect myself...

673
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:58,161
is that what you think this is?
Combat?

674
00:37:58,349 --> 00:37:59,867
I've been taken for granted before,

675
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,543
And I'm not gonna
let it happen again.

676
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:04,408
If I'm gonna give myself to you,
you damn well better worship me!

677
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:07,555
And I will do that...
morning and evening services.

678
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:09,536
Good.

679
00:38:09,761 --> 00:38:11,769
But you have to stop
treating this relationship

680
00:38:11,886 --> 00:38:14,246
Like it's a boxing match
only one of us can win.

681
00:38:14,403 --> 00:38:17,255
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

682
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,695
So it'd be nice

683
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,419
If you could take the gloves off
and trust me.

684
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,033
You're in love with me?

685
00:38:29,068 --> 00:38:31,792
My campaign--
That's about winning.

686
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:35,956
This, you and me,
it's about happiness.

687
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:40,600
And we could both
use a little.

688
00:38:43,842 --> 00:38:47,294
But maybe you need some
more time to think about it.

689
00:39:01,078 --> 00:39:02,605
Look. No gloves.

690
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:16,824
Travers conked out the moment
his head hit the pillow.

691
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,398
Poor little guy was beat.

692
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:21,492
Well, he should be.

693
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,500
We covered every inch
of that zoo.

694
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:25,160
Oh, check this out--

695
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:27,039
You and Travers
at the monkey house.

696
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:29,677
Oh, I look squinty.
Delete. Delete.

697
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:34,697
- There's the one the pretzel guy took.
- Look at the three of us.

698
00:39:34,826 --> 00:39:36,134
You have to e-Mail
me that one.

699
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,483
Isn't that great?

700
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,870
You know, he thought
that Travers had my eyes.

701
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:43,886
- Seriously?
- He totally thought we were a family.

702
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,300
Well, if we were,

703
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,541
We'd be one hell
of a good-Looking one.

704
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:52,798
Yeah. Nothing better than family.

705
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,227
And this time, I really mean it.

706
00:40:30,232 --> 00:40:31,300
Me, too.

707
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,716
Well you gonna say anyting

708
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,800
To be honest
I've heard a better aplogy.

709
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:45,282
But I how hard this must
have been for you.

710
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,571
And that makes me happy

711
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:49,000
So I accept.

712
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,113
Thanks.

713
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:52,698
That's big of you.

714
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:54,897
That is big of you to admit
you are a chucklehead.

715
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,622
I'll see you tomorrow.

716
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,047
Did you heard that, Gibert?

717
00:41:00,153 --> 00:41:01,316
He apologized.

718
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,828
I mean I know
he did it just for her sake

719
00:41:03,957 --> 00:41:05,200
But still...

720
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,500
maybe they have a good
marriage after all.

721
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,744
But they will never have what
we had will they gibert.

722
00:41:15,999 --> 00:41:17,702
Not by a long shot.

723
00:41:20,771 --> 00:41:21,827
<i>passion.

724
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,931
<i>It's a four so pont
we still remenber it

725
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:27,756
<i>long after it's faded away.

726
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,992
<i>A drive so alluring

727
00:41:31,162 --> 00:41:35,475
<i>it can push us to the arm
of unexpected lovers

728
00:41:37,836 --> 00:41:40,291
<i>a sensation so overwhelming

729
00:41:40,435 --> 00:41:42,303

731
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,494
