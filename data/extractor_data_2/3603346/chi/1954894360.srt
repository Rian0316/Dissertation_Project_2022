1
00:00:00,473 --> 00:00:02,174
"生活大爆炸" 前情提要...
Previously on The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:02,896 --> 00:00:04,830
当时有个女孩
Well, there was this girl.

3
00:00:05,198 --> 00:00:07,132
你干嘛了?
What did you do?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,133
没什么大事
Nothing.

5
00:00:08,201 --> 00:00:11,102
真的 就亲了一下
Really, it was just kissing.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,940
好吧
All right.

7
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,243
那 我们还是要结婚的吧?
So, we're still getting married?

8
00:00:20,112 --> 00:00:21,279
是啊
Yes.

9
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:24,549
因为我们彼此相爱
Because we love each other.

10
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,217
是啊
Yes.

11
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:29,654
而且这是我们最开心的一天
And it's the happiest day of our life.

12
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:31,022
别得寸进尺
Don't push it.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,927
我需要一点时间
I need some time to take a step back

14
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:39,164
重新考虑一下我们的关系
and reevaluate our situation.

15
00:00:40,199 --> 00:00:41,800
哦
Oh.

16
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,902
再见 Sheldon
Bye, Sheldon.

17
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,339
咕噜...
Well, Gollum...

18
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,677
你最懂戒指了
you're an expert on rings.

19
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:56,046
那我该拿这个戒指怎么办呢?
What do I do with this one?

20
00:00:56,745 --> 00:00:58,046
现在...

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,251
你想要哪个套餐?
So, what package are you thinking?

22
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,253
这套里面包括了音乐和鲜花
Mm, this one comes with music and flowers.

23
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:06,690
他们还会把整个视频传到网上
Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.

24
00:01:06,758 --> 00:01:08,125
干嘛要传网上?
Why would we want that?

25
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,527
因为有很多漂亮的金发妞
'Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there

26
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:13,296
不相信自己会嫁一个又矮又近视的科学家
who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist.

27
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,832
我们传播点希望吧
Let's give them hope.

28
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,466
随便啦 就传到网上吧
Whatever. Put us on the Internet.

29
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:20,369
反正我一直想给婚礼加个评论区
I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section.

30
00:01:20,437 --> 00:01:24,673
我... 如果你不喜欢 我们可以先不结婚
I... If you're not into this, we can do it another time.

31
00:01:24,742 --> 00:01:26,042
不不 我想结婚
No. No, I want to.

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,211
听着 我们已经拖得够久了
Look, we've put this off long enough.

33
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:29,712
来吧
Let's do it.

34
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,915
我们第一次滚床单的时候你也这么说
That's exactly what you said the first time we slept together.

35
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,318
抱歉
Oh, excuse me.

36
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,553
是Sheldon
Sheldon.

37
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,754
嘿
Hey.

38
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,688
Leonard 你结婚了吗?
Leonard, have you gotten married yet?

39
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:41,857
没 干嘛这么问?
No. Why?

40
00:01:41,924 --> 00:01:43,591
- 很好 别结!  - 为什么?
- Good. Don't do it!  - Why not?

41
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:45,927
我发现了非常重要的情报
Some important new information has come to light.

42
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:48,930
女人最渣了
Women are the worst.

43
00:01:48,998 --> 00:01:50,832
我以为最疼不过被纸割伤 但我错了
I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong.

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,701
没有纸能伤我这么深
No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.

45
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,470
出什么事了?
What happened now?

46
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:58,907
Amy和我分手了
Amy has ended our relationship.

47
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:00,242
不 真的吗?
Oh, no. Seriously?

48
00:02:00,309 --> 00:02:01,009
出什么事了?
What's going on?

49
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,510
Amy和Sheldon提分手了
Amy broke up with Sheldon.

50
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:03,744
她提了?
She did?

51
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:06,213
Penny哭了吗?
Is Penny crying?

52
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,281
没
No.

53
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:08,082
好吧 当然没有
No, of course not.

54
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,751
她们的快乐建立在我们痛苦之上
They thrive on our suffering.

55
00:02:10,819 --> 00:02:12,552
兄弟... 我很难过
Buddy, I... I'm so sorry.

56
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,554
有什么我能做的?
Is there anything I can do?

57
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:15,990
有 如果我以后
Yes. If I ever talk about

58
00:02:16,057 --> 00:02:18,259
再说要和女孩子去约会 记得翻白眼
going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me

59
00:02:18,326 --> 00:02:21,395
就跟你干蠢事 我翻你白眼一样
like I do to you when you say dumb things.

60
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:22,897
Sheldon 好吧 虽然
Sheldon, uh, o-okay, just because

61
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:24,364
你和Amy的事情不顺利
you're going through this with Amy

62
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,400
并不意味着所有女人都渣
doesn't mean that all women are bad.

63
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,769
随便了
Whatever.

64
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:30,136
我才听说
Hey, I just heard

65
00:02:30,204 --> 00:02:31,772
你和Sheldon的事 你还好吗?
about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?

66
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:32,939
不太好
Not really.

67
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:34,441
你能过来一下吗?
Can you come over?

68
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:36,042
嗯 其实我现在在拉斯维加斯
Uh, actually I'm in Vegas.

69
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,244
Leonard和我就要结婚了
Leonard and I are about to get married.

70
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,546
等等
Hold on.

71
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:42,015
你们结婚居然不邀请我?
You're getting married and you didn't invite me?

72
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:44,651
我们只是一时兴起
Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

73
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,052
哇
Wow.

74
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,856
希望我可以在这接到你扔来的花
Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.

75
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:51,725
Amy 不要这样
Amy, don't be like that.

76
00:02:51,793 --> 00:02:53,727
为什么我听到了Amy的名字?
Why did I just hear Amy's name?

77
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,894
Penny正和她打电话呢
Penny's on the phone with her.

78
00:02:54,962 --> 00:02:56,095
她说我什么了吗?
Did she say anything about me?

79
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,630
没事了 我才不关心呢
Never mind. I don't care.

80
00:02:57,698 --> 00:02:59,498
如果你关心的话你可以告诉我她说了什么
Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me.

81
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,635
当你发现我其实并不关心这些时不要吃惊
Just don't be shocked when you find out that I don't care.

82
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,769
你能不能别这么激动?
Okay, will you relax?

83
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:05,939
这又不是什么大不了的事
You're not missing anything special.

84
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,574
说什么呢?
Hey?

85
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:09,642
她很不开心
She's upset.

86
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,077
婚礼将会非常好的
Look, it's gonna be a great wedding.

00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:13,947
看你那穿着西服的小样
Look at you in your little suit.

88
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:15,715
Amy不开心? 是因为我吗?
Amy's upset? Is it about me?

89
00:03:15,782 --> 00:03:17,250
不是 我觉得是因为我们婚礼没邀请她
No, I think it's because we're eloping.

90
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,552
是因为你们的婚礼让她难受吗?
Your marriage is causing her pain?

91
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:20,853
太棒了 我收回刚才的话
Yeah, great, I take it back.

92
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,356
结吧! 为爱狂欢!

你在这干嘛?
What are you doing here?

106
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:01,657
我们上一次交谈 你说你需要时间
When last we spoke, you said you needed time.

107
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,093
才11个小时啊!
Well, it's only been 11 hours!

You seem to be headed somewhere.

113

我可以和你一起去吗?
May I walk with you?

00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,644
当然
Sure.

115
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,148
天哪 真高兴我们又可以一起去约会了
Boy, I'm glad we're going out again.

116
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,385
我们已经不在一起了
We're not back together.

117
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:30,452
为什么?
Why?

118
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,620
你看上别人了吗?
Is there someone else?

等不及跟别人上床了
Just couldn't wait for that first notch on your bedpost

是吗?
could you?

121
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:36,691
如果你一定想知道的话
If you must know,

122
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,193
我要去Howard家
I'm going to Howard and Bernadette's

123
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,627
看婚礼
to watch the wedding.

124
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:40,728
那你要带哪个男的去?
And who's this guy you're taking?

125
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,830
根本就没有男的好吗!
There's no guy!

126
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,331
你要一个人去看婚礼吗?
Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?

127
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:45,100
太悲剧了
That's sad.

128
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,334
我才不孤单呢
I'm not gonna be alone.

129
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,622
你要是饿了的话 旁边的脱衣舞厅有
Hey, if you're hungry, there's a breakfast buffet

130
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,824
自助早餐
at the strip club next door.

131
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:14,128
谢了 不过我不太想吃洒着闪光粉的炒鸡蛋
Thanks, but I don't like glitter on my scrambled eggs.

132
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:18,199
应该不是脱衣舞娘做的早餐吧 不过无所谓啦
I don't think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay.

133
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:22,837
那个... 现在这样和我预想的也不太一样
Look, it... it's not how I pictured it either,

134
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:24,472
不过我还是很高兴我们真的要结婚了
but I'm still glad we're doing it.

135
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,374
- 我也是  - 真的吗?
- Me, too.  - You sure?

136
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:27,842
- 真的  - 那你能保证
- Yes.  - And you promise

137
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:29,844
对刚才车上我说的事完全不介意吗?
you're okay with everything from the car?

138
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:31,611
天啊 你能不能别提了?
Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?

139
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,513
你说得对 抱歉
You're right. I'm sorry.

140
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,015
我们有后半辈子的时间
We have the rest of our lives

141
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:38,319
为过去的事纠缠不休呢
to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it.

142
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:40,687
所以 你说呢?
So what do you think?

143
00:05:40,755 --> 00:05:42,589
我们要不要去旁边吃点东西?
Should we run next door and grab a bite?

144
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,124
要是一会叫到我们了怎么办?
What if they call our names?

145
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:47,694
没关系 他们给我这个震动号牌了
Oh, don't worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.

146
00:05:47,762 --> 00:05:51,130
还真是跟童话一样美好啊
Oh, and the fairy tale continues.

147
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,569
谢谢你们
Thank you for doing this.

148
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:56,737
不用谢
Our pleasure.

149
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:58,004
你感觉好点吗?
You feeling okay?

150
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:00,073
我们在一起的时间太长了
We were together for so long,

151
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,509
说实话 我自己都不知道现在是什么感觉
I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.

152
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,644
我深表理解
Well, that's understandable.

153
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,180
你忘了 这种感觉就是"快乐"
You forgot. It's called "Happy."

154
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:08,615
Howard你说什么呢
Howard.

155
00:06:08,683 --> 00:06:09,716
我又没说什么不好的话
I'm not saying anything bad.

156
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,885
只不过是她爱上了束缚住她的人
Just that she was in love with her captor

157
00:06:11,952 --> 00:06:15,221
而现在终于从他黑暗变态的地牢里逃出来了而已
and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.

158
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:18,057
我明白你的感受
I know what you're going through.

159
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,526
我... 我上一次分手的时候也很难过
My... my last breakup was pretty tough.

160
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,795
你前女友叫什么?
Oh. What was her name?

161
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:23,963
嘿 我说的是真的
Hey, it's a true story.

162
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,065
别这样审问我
I don't need the third degree.

163
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:33,839
神啊 Sheldon 你在这里干什么呢?
For God's sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?

164
00:06:33,908 --> 00:06:35,440
我没想进去
I didn't want to come in.

165
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,610
有人告诉我 如果我进去的话大家都会觉得不舒服
I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.

166
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,578
所以我就在这里待着好了
So I'll just stay out here

167
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,948
还要假装没有很想去洗手间的样子
and pretend that I don't have to go to the bathroom.

168
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,886
Howard 交给你了
Howard, do something.

169
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:49,988
来了
I'm on it.

170
00:06:56,963 --> 00:07:00,631
Sheldon 出现在这对你没好处啊
Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.

171
00:07:00,698 --> 00:07:02,599
我发现了
I see.

172
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,202
所以你们才邀请了除了我以外的所有人吗?
And is that why everybody was invited but me?

173
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,204
他们没有邀请除了你以外的所有人
They didn't invite everybody but you.

174
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,772
Bernadette邀请了我而已
Bernadette invited me,

175
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,074
Stuart就住在这里
and Stuart lives here.

176
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,843
谁想吃刚出炉的肉桂卷?
Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?

177
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:18,649
所以 一会听到的音乐就是你们的提示
So, when you hear the music, that's your cue.

178
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:19,951
还有什么问题吗?
Any questions?

179
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:21,919
呃 我们购买的套装里
Oh, the package that we paid for

180
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,520
好像还应该包括地毯上铺满玫瑰花瓣的
said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.

181
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:25,888
玫瑰花瓣怎么没有了?!
Where are the rose petals?!

182
00:07:25,957 --> 00:07:27,991
- 花瓣用完了!  - 这样啊
- We're out!  - You know what?

183
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:29,259
那算了吧
It's fine.

184
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,727
不过我们可以用洗手间里的干花!
We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!

185
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:33,430
真的 这样就行了
Really, we're good.

186
00:07:33,497 --> 00:07:35,065
没错 就是想结个婚而已
Yup, just want to get married.

187
00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:36,266
- 是的  - 好吧
- Yeah.  - Great.

188
00:07:36,334 --> 00:07:38,301
我在前面等你们
I'll see you two up there.

189
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:43,306
- 就是现在了  - 是啊
- This is it.  - I know.

190
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:46,108
我爱你
I love you.

191
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:48,077
我也爱你
I love you, too.

192
00:07:48,144 --> 00:07:50,580
你们还要不要厕所的干花了?!
Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?!

193
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:52,715
- 不用 谢谢!  - 没事了!
- No, thank you!  - We're good!

194
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:57,386
Raj 你可能在好奇
Raj, you're probably wondering

195
00:07:57,454 --> 00:08:00,957
为什么Amy和我没有在互诉情肠
why Amy and I aren't showing any affection to one another.

196
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:03,192
还没挤进我的好奇榜前十
Didn't even crack the top ten.

197
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,295
是这样的
Well, you should know

198
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:07,930
她刚刚和我分手了
that she recently broke up with me.

199
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:10,799
我说了我需要时间来考虑
I said I needed time to think.

200
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,135
你俩一定能想出些办法的
I'm sure you guys will figure something out.

201
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,904
你瞅瞅 Raj都崩溃了
You hear that? Raj is devastated.

202
00:08:15,972 --> 00:08:18,673
Sheldon 嘘 婚礼开始了
Sheldon, shh. The wedding's starting.

203
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,309
我知道怎么回事了
I see what's happening.

204
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,643
大家要分裂成小团体了
Sides are forming.

205
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:23,812
假如Bernadette站在Amy那边 那我就选Howard
Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team, I pick Howard.

206
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,913
我保持中立
I'm not taking sides.

207
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,382
好吧 那我只好选Raj了
Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.

208
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:27,716
是吗?
Really?

209
00:08:27,783 --> 00:08:30,519
至少有人选你呢
At least you got picked.

210
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,322
我提前问一句
Before I go any further,

211
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,289
你们双方都准备好婚礼誓词了吗?
have either of you prepared your own vows?

212
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,790
- 准备了  - 没有
- Yes.  - No.

213
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:39,527
你写了誓词?
You wrote vows?

214
00:08:39,594 --> 00:08:40,594
对啊
Yeah.

215
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,330
我还没有呢
Well, I don't have any.

216
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:45,066
你这是让我出洋相啊
You're kind of making me look bad.

217
00:08:45,134 --> 00:08:47,601
没事的 我... 我也没必要念出来
It's okay. I... I don't have to say them.

218
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,969
不 不 不 念吧
No, no, no, go ahead.

219
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,940
我能想点煽情的 然后你会哭 一切都搞定
I'll come up with something mushy, you'll cry, we got this.

220
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:55,743
"Penny 我们是由
"Penny, we are made of particles

221
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,111
"宇宙形成时就存在的粒子组成的
"That have existed since the moment the universe began.

222
00:08:58,179 --> 00:09:00,947
"我相信这些原子
"I like to think those atoms traveled

223
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:04,017
"为了创造我们 穿越了140亿年的时空
"14 billion years through time and space to create us,

224
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:08,021
让我们相知相爱 让我们成为一体"
so that we could be together and make each other whole."

225
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,524
哇
Wow.

226
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,260
Penny你的呢?
Penny?

227
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:17,030
哦 对 嗯... 好吧
Right. Um... okay.

228
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,936
Leonard 你不只是我一生所爱
Leonard, I mean, you're not only the love of my life.

229
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,204
你还是我的挚友 而且...
I mean, you're my best friend, and...

230
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:30,242
我是你的好朋友
you've got a friend in me.

231
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,948
你遇到的困难
You got troubles.

232
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:36,816
也是我的困难
I got 'em, too.

233
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:41,988
我什么事都愿意为你做
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.

234
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,558
我们会齐心协力 然后解决问题
We stick together, and we can see it through,

235
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,927
因为... 我是你的好朋友
'cause... you've got a friend in me.

236
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,731
那是玩具总动员的主题曲吗?
Is that the song from Toy Story?

237
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,799
他超爱那部电影
He loves that movie.

238
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,301
的确
I do.

239
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,272
- 哇 这场面太美了  - 对啊
- Aw, that was beautiful.  - Yeah.

240
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,208
我是说 虽然不如咱们的婚礼美
I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.

241
00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,910
不 我们赢定了
No, we totally won.

242
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:07,778
Amy 我不理解 我们到底有没有分手?
Amy, I don't understand, are we broken up or not?

243
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,380
好像你下不了决心一样
It's like you can't make up your mind.

244
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:12,450
因为你没有给我空间去考虑
It's because you're not giving me any space to think.

245
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,751
那你就给我快点儿想
Well, you should think fast,

246
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:16,221
因为男人一生都可以产生精子繁衍后代
because men can sire offspring their entire lives,

247
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:19,357
而你们的那些卵子就过期不候了
but those eggs you're toting around have a sell-by date.

248
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,896
Sheldon 你说出这种话让我不纠结了
You know what, Sheldon, you've made this really easy.

249
00:10:25,964 --> 00:10:29,267
你幼稚 自私 刚才还当面侮辱我
You're immature, you're selfish, you just insulted me to my face.

250
00:10:29,335 --> 00:10:31,636
我不需要再考虑了 我们分手了
I don't need any more time to think. We're broken up.

251
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:32,870
喂 Amy...
Amy...

252
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,741
有人载我回家吗?
Will someone take me home?

253
00:10:36,808 --> 00:10:37,842
好吧 走吧 我带你回去
Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.

254
00:10:37,909 --> 00:10:40,611
象征了你们不朽的爱情
Symbolizes your eternal love.

255
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:44,248
我现在宣布你们结为夫妻
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

256
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,051
我们结婚啦!
We did it!

257
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:50,755
我真高兴你们能见证这一时刻!
I'm so glad you guys could watch!

258
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:54,324
我们在评论区里写上"甚是美好"吧
We'll say it was beautiful in the comment section.

259
00:11:04,923 --> 00:11:06,656
不 不 不 等一会
No, no, no. Hang on.

260
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,926
新浪该抱着新娘跨过门槛的
I believe I'm supposed to carry you across the threshold.

261
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:12,461
你行吗你?
Can you?

262
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
你觉得每次Sheldon在电视机前睡着了
Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed

263
00:11:14,297 --> 00:11:16,765
是谁把他抱上床睡觉的?
when he falls asleep in front of the TV?

264
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,567
好吧 那你抱吧
Okay, let's do it.

265
00:11:27,577 --> 00:11:29,778
- 你行不行啊?  - 我行的!
- You gonna make it?  - I'm okay!

266
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,550
行啊你!
Nicely done!

267
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:35,951
谢谢
Thank you.

268
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:37,085
我总算没有
Finally, there's a Mrs. Hofstadter

269
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,654
让Hofstadter夫人失望
who isn't disappointed in me.

270
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:41,722
夜色还早
Well, the night is still young.

271
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,603
你还好吗?
Everything all right?

272
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,906
还好吧 我想
Yeah. I guess.

273
00:11:58,974 --> 00:12:01,709
有事就说啊
Just tell me.

274
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:03,844
只是 在吻你的时候
It's just, when we were kissing,

275
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:06,280
我总是忍不住会脑补到你吻那个女孩的场景
I couldn't help but picture you with that other girl.

276
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,281
哦 不
Oh, no.

277
00:12:07,348 --> 00:12:08,583
不 拜托
No, come on.

278
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,884
不是说好
I have a friend in you.

279
00:12:09,952 --> 00:12:12,119
是好朋友吗
You said so.

280
00:12:12,187 --> 00:12:13,854
说得对 当我刚才没说吧
You're right. Just forget it.

281
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,890
对啊
Yeah.

282
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:22,096
好吧 听着 呃
Okay, listen. Uh...

283
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,399
别把我和她亲吻的场景想象的很性感 
If you're imagining that it was sexy.

284
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,467
不是的
It wasn't.

285
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:28,235
我们都喝醉了 她身上一股烟味
We... we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray.

286
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:31,871
那船还摇摇晃晃的 弄得我还磕到了她牙齿
The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.

287
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,974
你觉得内疚吗?
Did you feel guilty?

288
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:36,477
不会 她上了牙科保险的
No, she had dental insurance.

289
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:40,714
你吻了她觉得内疚吗
Did you feel guilty after kissing her?

290
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,883
当然啦 吻她那一瞬间我就觉得很内疚了
Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened.

291
00:12:43,951 --> 00:12:47,020
到现在每一次一见到她我就觉得很内疚
I feel guilty every time I see her.

292
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,889
每一次见到她是什么意思?
What do you mean, every time you see her?

293
00:12:49,957 --> 00:12:51,891
我... 说的话什么意思来着?
What... do I mean?

294
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,527
好家伙 这可真是个难题啊
Boy, that's a toughie.

295
00:12:54,595 --> 00:12:57,130
你们还有联系?
You still see her?

296
00:12:57,197 --> 00:12:59,132
呃 不是那种联系
Well, no, not socially.

297
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,366
但 你要知道 工作的时候会见到嘛
But, you know, just at work.

298
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,869
你和她一起工作?!
You work with her?!

299
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:04,437
为什么不告诉我?!
How could you not tell me that?!

300
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:06,973
在车里的时候我想告诉你来着 但你叫我闭嘴!
I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking!

301
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,608
哦 好吧 所以这都是我的错咯?
Oh, okay. So you're saying this is my fault?

302
00:13:08,676 --> 00:13:10,110
不 当然不是了
No, of course not.

303
00:13:10,177 --> 00:13:11,745
好吧 听着
Okay, look,

304
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,146
与其接着吵架
instead of fighting,

305
00:13:13,213 --> 00:13:15,715
我们还不如把灯关了
why don't we dim the lights,

306
00:13:15,783 --> 00:13:19,618
嗯 把衣服脱了然后一起造个人?
um, get naked and make a baby?

307
00:13:26,126 --> 00:13:28,994
我只不过是想缓和下气氛
I was trying to lighten the mood.

308
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,330
很不容易的 你试试就知道了
It's not easy. You try it.

309
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:34,667
你好 母亲
Hello, Mother.

310
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:36,935
Shelly! 我的宝贝最近如何啊?
Shelly! How's my baby doing?

311
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:38,403
我只想让你知道
I just wanted to let you know

312
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,406
Amy可以从你的夜晚祷告名单里面除去了
that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers.

313
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:43,208
除非你愿意帮我祈祷
Unless you're open to praying for

314
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,510
一个蜂窝会扣在她头上
a beehive to fall on her head.

315
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:47,712
哦 怎么了?
Oh, what's going on?

316
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,013
她和我分手了
She broke up with me.

317
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:50,481
哦 Shelly
Oh, Shelly.

318
00:13:50,549 --> 00:13:51,282
不 我会没事的
No, I'll be okay.

319
00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:53,217
不过 我觉得我可以
But I think that I'd like

320
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:55,953
把戒指寄回给您了
to send the ring back to you.

321
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,121
不要太着急
Well, let's not be hasty.

322
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,923
你确定一切都结束了吗?
Are you sure it's over for good?

323
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:01,125
我是结束了 我受够女人了
It's over for me. I'm done with women.

324
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,061
就像我发誓不吃跳跳糖一样
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.

325
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:06,330
他们都是故意伤人的
They both hurt you on purpose.

326
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,399
可以告诉我事情的经过吗?
You want to tell me what happened?

327
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,701
你会说一切都是冥冥之中天注定的吗?
Are you going to say it's all part of God's plan?

328
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:11,601
很有可能
Good chance.

329
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:13,804
那算了 谢谢
Then no, thank you.

330
00:14:13,871 --> 00:14:15,605
宝贝啊 先别寄回来
Well, honey, don't send it back yet.

331
00:14:15,673 --> 00:14:17,833
你姐姐已经结婚了 我不想让你哥
Your sister's married, and I'm not letting your brother

332
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,511
把祖传戒指交给他正在交往的贱人
give my grandmother's ring to that whore he's dating.

333
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:25,348
抹大拉的马利亚（被耶稣拯救的妓女）不也名誉不佳吗?
Wasn't Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?

334
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,051
等哪天你那不开窍的哥哥拯救了人类
When your idiot brother redeems mankind,

335
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:31,221
他想和谁交往都行
he can date whoever he wants.

336
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,726
我知道你现在很伤心 但会好起来的
I know it hurts now, but it's gonna get better.

337
00:14:35,793 --> 00:14:36,726
没错
Yeah.

338
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,094
一切都会好转的
Everything's gonna be okay.

339
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:40,996
你身上优点多得是
You've got so much to offer.

340
00:14:41,064 --> 00:14:42,264
谢谢你
Thank you.

341
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,600
与你相伴是任何男人的福分
Any man would be lucky to have you.

342
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,202
一点没错
That's true.

343
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:48,570
我只是希望我做对了事情
I just hope I did the right thing.

344
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,972
那是肯定的
I'm sure you did.

345
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,142
或许这就是问题所在... 你一直在做对的事情
Maybe that's the problem... you always do the right thing.

346
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,612
或许是时候错一错了
Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing.

347
00:15:03,285 --> 00:15:06,420
就像你现在这样?
Like you're doing right now?

348
00:15:08,323 --> 00:15:10,925
是的
Exactly.

349
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,631
我一遍又一遍地问你愿不愿意
I asked you over and over if you were okay.

350
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:18,938
你既然不愿意 又何必要参加婚礼?
Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't?

351
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,036
我本来觉得自己愿意 但结果并非如此
I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not.

352
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:24,773
好吧 听着 我可能没做到百分百的真诚
Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful,

353
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,308
但是你 抬你真的不容易啊!
but you, you are not easy to lift!

354
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:33,147
哇哦!
Wow!

355
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:35,182
结了婚就是不一样
Well, marriage must agree with you.

356
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,352
你简直红光焕发啊
Well, you are just glowing.

357
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,691
我才没红光焕发
I'm not glowing.

358
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,293
我生着气呢
I'm upset.

359
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,462
不管是什么 你看起来很不错
Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.

360
00:15:57,438 --> 00:16:00,274
咚咚咚 Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

361
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:03,576
咚咚咚 Penny? 咚咚咚 Penny?
Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?

362
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,014
这是干什么?
What's this?

363
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,282
Leonard把事情告诉我了
Leonard told me what happened,

364
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:11,151
所以我就自发给你做了点热饮
so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.

365
00:16:11,219 --> 00:16:12,820
你真贴心啊
Oh. That's so sweet of you.

366
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:14,421
是啊 我知道
Yeah. I know.

367
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:16,889
不过 在这世道
Turns out, being sweet

368
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,425
单单贴心可留不住女孩
isn't enough to keep a girl these days.

369
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,493
{\an8}暗指麦当娜的歌曲拜金女孩material girl

370
00:16:19,492 --> 00:16:21,493
我觉得要怪麦当娜
I blame Madonna.

371
00:16:21,561 --> 00:16:24,496
你和Amy分手的事真是可惜
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.

372
00:16:24,564 --> 00:16:25,965
关于Leonard 也是可惜
Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.

373
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,513
我以为自己已经把他调教好了
Thought I raised him better than that.

374
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:30,636
本来这事就够糟糕了
You know, it's bad enough what happened,

375
00:16:30,704 --> 00:16:33,239
他还试图隐瞒他每天
but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her

376
00:16:33,307 --> 00:16:35,174
都在学校里看见她的事实
all the time at the university.

377
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,576
每天都见? 是谁啊?
He does? Who is it?

378
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:39,911
一个叫Mandy的女孩
Some girl named Mandy.

379
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,081
- Mandy Chao?  - 就这货
- Mandy Chao?  - Yeah.

380
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:44,817
你没必要担心人家啦
Oh, you don't need to worry about her.

381
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,017
她智慧和美丽兼具
She's brilliant and attractive.

382
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,520
她才看不上Leonard呢
She can do way better than Leonard.

383
00:16:53,025 --> 00:16:54,560
真好啊
That's great.

384
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,262
等一等
Wait a minute.

385
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,264
我知道这听起来有点不靠谱
I know this may sound farfetched,

386
00:16:59,332 --> 00:17:00,999
但我现在单身待售呢
but I'm on the market now.

387
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:02,800
我要是跟Mandy约会
You know, if I dated Mandy,

388
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:05,770
算是同时给Leonard和Amy一个教训
that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.

389
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:07,339
太荒谬了
That's ridiculous.

390
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:09,540
嗯 你说得对 我不能跟一个自尊心低到
Oh, you're right. I could never be with a woman

391
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:12,344
跟Leonard约会的人在一起
whose self-esteem was so low she'd be with Leonard.

392
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,080
我跟Leonard在一起呢
I'm with Leonard.

393
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:17,548
嗯 我知道 回不了头了
Yeah, I know. Forever.

394
00:17:19,651 --> 00:17:22,587
真想不到会走到今天这一步？
Who would have believed these things would happen to us?

395
00:17:22,654 --> 00:17:24,122
对吧？
Right?

396
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,125
不敢相信Amy真的说到做到了
I can't believe Amy actually went through with it.

397
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,460
等下
Hang on.

398
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,096
你早就知道她要跟我分手？
You knew that she was going to end it with me?

399
00:17:32,163 --> 00:17:33,864
你有试着阻止她吗？
Did you try and stop her?

400
00:17:33,932 --> 00:17:38,102
我告诉她听从自己的想法做让她开心的事
I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.

401
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:39,336
做让她开心的事？
Do what makes her happy?

402
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:41,906
她会弹竖琴 而且车付了全款
She plays the harp and her car is paid for.

403
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:44,041
她还想要多快乐？
How much happier can she be?

404
00:17:44,876 --> 00:17:46,643
好吧 听着 她觉得你是个糟糕的男友
Okay, look, it's not my fault

405
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:49,313
不是我的错
that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.

406
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,216
我懂了
I see.

407
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:54,285
好吧...
Well...

408
00:17:58,188 --> 00:18:00,056
我要走了
I think I'll be going.

409
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,725
- Sheldon...  - 别说话
- Sheldon...  - No, no, no, no.

410
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:05,128
我们谈完了
We are done here.

411
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,333
你能不能打开门
Would you mind opening the door

412
00:18:10,401 --> 00:18:13,569
然后非常生气地在我背后关上？
and then angrily slamming it behind me?

413
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:16,005
当然
Sure.

414
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:17,974
谢谢
Thank you.

415
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,675
注意摔狠点
And slam it hard,

416
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:21,444
因为我非常生气
because I am pretty steamed.

417
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:25,815
好吧 Leonard 别伤心
All right, Leonard, hang in there.

418
00:18:25,882 --> 00:18:28,083
明天见
Talk to you tomorrow.

419
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,787
怎么了？ 他们才刚结婚
What happened? They just got married.

420
00:18:31,855 --> 00:18:33,255
我不知道
I don't know.

421
00:18:33,323 --> 00:18:36,625
乱七八糟的 他们在维加斯大吵了一架
It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.

422
00:18:36,693 --> 00:18:37,860
你觉得他们会分手吗？
Think they'll break up?

423
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,128
不晓得 听着挺糟糕的
I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.

424
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:42,931
Penny一个人搬回她公寓了
Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.

425
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,367
是咩？
Really?

426
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,268
你想不想再听一个
Would you like to hear another reason

427
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,203
男人比女人好的原因？
why men are better than women?

428
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,506
当然 凑齐一百个吧
Sure, let's make it an even hundred.

429
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:07,176
你绝对不会吻我 然后让我说"我爱你"
You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"

430
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,845
然后跟我分手
and then break up with me.

431
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,780
我确实不会
I wouldn't.

432
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,250
你知道为什么吗？
And you know why?

433
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:15,784
因为你是个男人
'Cause you're a man.

434
00:19:15,853 --> 00:19:19,288
性别里的香槟酒
The champagne of genders.

435
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:21,457
我虽然是个男人
Well, I may be a man,

436
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:24,360
但我觉得这次是我把事情搞砸了
but I think I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

437
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:27,996
好吧 但你承认了 像个男人一样
Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.

438
00:19:28,064 --> 00:19:29,464
女人们就只会说
All you hear women say is,

439
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:32,133
"我点个沙拉就好" 对不?
"I'll just have a salad." You know?

440
00:19:32,201 --> 00:19:33,935
"我的润唇膏呢？"
"Where's my lip gloss?"

441
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:36,671
"我觉得这个元素应该叫镭"
"I think this element should be called radium."

442
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:41,109
最后一个是居里夫人
That last one was Madame Curie.

443
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,811
我猜出来了
I figured that out.

444
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:46,247
你知道吗？ 她算是名义上的男人
You know what? She was kind of an honorary man.

445
00:19:46,314 --> 00:19:49,684
科学给了她男人的家伙
She had a penis made of science.

446
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:56,591
真不敢相信我新婚夜是跟你过的
Can't believe I'm spending my wedding night with you.

447
00:19:56,658 --> 00:19:57,992
是吗？
Really?

448
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:00,227
这一直是我预料的结果
I never imagined it any other way.
