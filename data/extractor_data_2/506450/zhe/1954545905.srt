The Final Problem

5
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,188
1891年春天 当我从一个短暂的休假
When I returned to Baker Street

6
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,106
回到贝克街的时候
from a short holiday in the spring of 1891,

7
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:46,171
我只见到过福尔摩斯没几次
I had seen little of Holmes for some time.

8
00:03:00,034 --> 00:03:02,326
我从报纸上获悉 他受聘于法国政府
I saw in the papers that he had been engaged

9
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:05,973
承办一件极为重要的案子
by the French government upon a matter of supreme importance

10
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:08,893
但是 出乎我预计的是
but I could hardly foresee that it would have

11
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,082
这居然会产生如此可怕的后果
so violent a consequence.

12
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:15,043
现在必须由我来告知
It lies with me now to tell for the first time

13
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,315
在那决定性的一年 发生在
what took place between Mr. Sherlock Holmes

14
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:24,214
福尔摩斯和莫里亚蒂教授之间的事
and Professor Moriarity in that fateful year.

15
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:29,113
啊 哈德森太太 福尔摩斯先生回来了吗?
Ah, Mrs. Hudson has Mr. Holmes returned?

16
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,988
哦 他已经回来了
Oh, he has indeed.

17
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:31,823
他很早就来了
He came in early.

18
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:34,013
应该是7点之前
Must have been before 7:00.

19
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,097
他说 早啊 哈德森太太
"Morning Mrs. Hudson" he says,

20
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,807
给我准备了些什么美味的早餐没?
"Have you anything nice for my breakfast?"

21
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,725
好像他四个月里根本没离开过
as if he hadn't been away for four months.

22
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,332
你本来可以让我大吃一惊的
You could have knocked me down with a feather.

23
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:47,875
那我猜他马上又出去了?
And he's gone out again I take it?

24
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:51,314
是的 是的 他吃完早餐就又出去了
Yes, yes he had his breakfast and then he went out again

25
00:03:51,352 --> 00:03:53,816
就在他的拜访者离开后不久
just after his visitor left.

26
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:56,839
拜访者?
Visitor?

27
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:00,071
一个上了年纪的人
An elderly gentleman.

28
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:03,196
他们还吵了几句
They had words.

29
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:07,679
我不喜欢那人的长相 一点都不喜欢
I didn't like the look of him, not at all I didn't.

30
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,536
他的表情带着上帝的愤怒
He had a face like, like the wrath of God

31
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:13,725
更甚是恶魔的愤怒
or should I say the devil.

32
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,288
的确
Indeed.

33
00:04:17,373 --> 00:04:19,457
我们是否应该开一瓶顶级红酒
Should we open a bottle of the best claret

34
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,063
来庆祝福尔摩斯先生的回归?
to celebrate Mr. Holmes' return?

35
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:24,043
为什么不呢?
Why not?

36
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:25,606
很好
Very good.

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,378
谢谢你 哈德森太太
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson.

38
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,486
我后来才知道 福尔摩斯先生在那天
I learned later that Holmes had survived three attempts

39
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,361
已经三次从试图取他性命的预谋中逃脱
on his life that very day.

40
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:37,697
但在我等待他回家之际时
But as I waited for him to reappear

41
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:42,700
我眼中的贝克街一如既往的平和安宁
Baker Street looked to me as safe and secure as ever.

42
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:37,943
福尔摩斯 你...
Holmes you...

43
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:42,112
等等 等等
Wait, wait.

44
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,267
这是什么
What is it?

45
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:03,791
气枪 事实上 是一把非常特别的气枪
Air guns, a rather special air gun in fact.

46
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:08,066
华生 你不反对把窗帘拉上吧?
Watson would you have any objection to drawing

47
00:06:08,103 --> 00:06:12,443
随意点 装成好像只有你独自在这房间
the blinds casually as if you were alone in this room?

48
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,876
我想你对我是非常了解的 华生 你知道
Watson I think you know me well enough to understand

49
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:40,794
我并不是一个胆小怕事的人
that I am by no means a nervous man.

50
00:06:43,088 --> 00:06:45,797
可如果你危险临头还不承认有危险
But it is stupidity rather than courage

51
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:49,237
那就是有勇无谋了
to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you.

52
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:59,139
该死
Damn!

53
00:07:03,725 --> 00:07:06,226
华生 能给我根火柴吗?
Watson, might I have a match?

54
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,063
福尔摩斯 你受伤了
Holmes, you're hurt.

55
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:14,357
划伤而已 没事的
Scratches, nothing, nothing to signify.

56
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,529
你看起来不太好 福尔摩斯
You don't look well Holmes.

57
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:30,616
近来我把自己搞得过于精疲力尽了
Well I have been using myself rather too freely.

58
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,743
最近我有点儿吃紧
I have been somewhat pressed but late.

59
00:07:34,473 --> 00:07:35,931
怎么了?
How pressed?

60
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,789
既然我在天黑前不可能离开这房间
Well as I am unable to leave this room until after dark

61
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,874
也不可能走回我来的那条路
and then most likely on the way that I came,

62
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,688
我们现在有足够的时间
we do have some time on our hands.

63
00:07:46,565 --> 00:07:50,420
自从上次见面后 我还欠你一个
Also I owe you an explanation for my unceremonious departure

64
00:07:50,526 --> 00:07:52,088
不告而别的解释
the last time that we met.

65
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,903
我想记些笔记 可以吗?
I'll take some notes if I may?

66
00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:57,091
哦 当然
Oh, by all means.

67
00:07:57,128 --> 00:07:58,966
这个案子
This case...

68
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:03,136
这个案子 在犯罪年鉴上
This case, it is unique

69
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,951
是很罕见的
in the annuals of crime.

70
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:12,830
你还记得我年初离开贝克街的时间
You will recall that it was a cold morning early in the year

71
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,601
是一个寒冷的早晨吗
when I last left Baker Street.

72
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:20,648
我对自己的去处和委托人身份毫不知情
I had no idea where I was going or who my client was.

73
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:22,210
我所知道的就是 这非常重要
All I knew was that it was important

74
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:23,462
并且发生在国外
and abroad.

75
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,047
我的目的地就是巴黎的卢浮宫和博物馆
My destination was the museum and the Louve was in Paris

76
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,738
而我的委托人 正是法国政府
and my client none less than the French government.

77
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:45,976
卢浮宫可以称得上是法国的心脏
Surely this Louve is near to the very heart of France.

78
00:08:46,184 --> 00:08:49,831
伟大的法官就在这里开庭审理
It was here that the great Musele held court

79
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:52,437
也是拿破仑
and here that Napoleon Bonaparte

80
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:54,417
和皇女
was married to the Archduchess Madam

81
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:55,982
奥地利公主玛丽・路易丝结婚的地方
Marie Louise of Austria.

82
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,151
这里正是历史的纪念碑
Indeed it is a history lesson in stone.

83
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,008
现在 画廊拥有着世上最优秀的作品
And now this gallery contains our finest paintings.

84
00:09:06,406 --> 00:09:08,490
先生们 我们能不能直奔主题?
Gentlemen, shall we come to the point?

85
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,346
我推测蒙娜丽莎被偷了
I presume the Mona Lisa has been stolen.

86
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:20,268
当我看到原来悬挂蒙娜丽莎的墙壁
When I see two hooks and the place where

87
00:09:20,305 --> 00:09:23,811
以及那两个挂钩 再加上这些
the Mona Lisa used to hang and then this talk

88
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:26,312
八卦一类的谈话
of... and scandal.

89
00:09:30,587 --> 00:09:33,922
我终于有点明白这件事的谨慎之因了
Yes, now I begin to understand the delicacy of the matter.

90
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,739
卢浮宫每周一都会闭馆整顿
The Louve is closed on Mondays for maintenance.

91
00:09:42,052 --> 00:09:44,136
蒙娜丽莎没有被悬挂在原处
The fact that the Mona Lisa was not hanging

92
00:09:44,173 --> 00:09:46,011
无疑是因为
in her usual place was no doubt due to the fact

93
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,306
它曾被带去一个摄影工作室
that she was in the photographic studio.

94
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:52,579
仅仅一天之后 一个工人
It was only later in the day that a workman found the frame

95
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:56,852
在展览馆的某小储藏室里发现了画框
in a little storeroom under the salon care.

96
00:09:57,687 --> 00:09:59,458
我们在一个月前
We put the glass over the painting

97
00:09:59,496 --> 00:10:00,814
才刚刚给画像安上玻璃
only a month ago.

98
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,688
防止它被酸侵蚀 最近
We feared an acid attack, there was such a one

99
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,732
在佛罗伦萨就发生了这种事
in Florence recently.

100
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,878
真是幸运啊
How very fortunate.

101
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:05,920
你说什么
Pardon?

102
00:10:05,957 --> 00:10:08,421
有两个清晰的指纹
Two good thumb prints.

103
00:10:17,178 --> 00:10:20,095
许多艺术家来这制作复制品
Many artists come here to make copies of the paintings.

104
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:28,747
这幅模仿得极像
This one seems well done.

105
00:10:28,784 --> 00:10:31,144
是的 那个艺术家极具天赋
Yes, that artist is particularly clever

106
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,542
并且凭借他的复制才能过着优渥的生活
and makes a good living from his copying.

107
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:35,835
我想见见他
I should like to meet him sometime.

108
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:58,974
做一件失败的复制品非常简单 反之
To make a bad copy is very easy but a good one,

109
00:11:00,017 --> 00:11:01,788
则需要多年的练习
it takes years of practice.

110
00:11:01,997 --> 00:11:03,768
例如 达・芬奇
For instance De Vinci

111
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:08,562
他用意大利木来作画
used Italian popular wood to paint on.

112
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,961
这种材料非常少见
It is very difficult to find.

113
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,818
想要和原来的颜色一致 几乎是不可能的
To match the original color, nearly impossible.

114
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:19,403
这是非常成熟的作品 色调流畅柔和
It is, uh, full mature, the smooth blended tones,

115
00:11:20,133 --> 00:11:23,259
非常精妙 还有他的笔法
very subtle and his brushwork

116
00:11:23,297 --> 00:11:24,719
他是左手作画的
is left-handed.

117
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,825
那些断痕 那些完美
The crack work, this fine network

118
00:11:29,863 --> 00:11:32,849
断痕的交叉 看左边
of cracks, left, ah.

119
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,810
要想模仿全部是非常困难的
that is the most difficult to achieve of all.

120
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:39,103
可是你可以?
And you can achieve it?

121
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,250
你是如何做到的?
How?

122
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:43,272
那是我的秘密
That is my secret.

123
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:46,711
在我看来 这并不能算是
It seems to me that this is something

124
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,690
合法伪造
near to a legitimate forgery.

125
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:51,297
不 不 不 因为这些复制品和原作
No, no, no because the copies must never

126
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,069
并不是同一尺寸
be the same size as the original.

127
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:55,883
再说 既然真正的蒙娜丽莎还在卢浮宫
And, and who would buy one of my copies as the original

128
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,697
谁会来买我的复制品呢
when the real Mona Lisa is in the Louve.

129
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:00,262
但是 如果蒙娜丽莎恰巧
But if by chance the Mona Lisa

130
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,241
不在卢浮宫了呢?
is no longer in the Louve?

131
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,098
显然你是在说笑
But of course you are joking Messier.

132
00:12:14,021 --> 00:12:17,147
幸好法国警察在指纹检测方面
Happily the French police are well ahead of the British

133
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:19,126
比英国的要出色
when it comes to fingerprints.

134
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,192
伟大的班逊是如此谦逊
The great Bantion himself was kind enough to refer

135
00:12:23,229 --> 00:12:26,527
将我的嫌犯小册子当作他的圣经
to my little pamphlet on the subject as his bible.

136
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:30,696
如我怀疑的 嫌犯过去曾
As I suspected, our man had been involved

137
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:34,866
犯下轻罪  他叫门德萨 西班牙人
in petty crime in the past, a Spaniard named Mendosa.

138
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,827
看 他就是你们要找的小偷
There, there is your thief.

139
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:41,329
一看就不是善类
Not a pleasant specimen.

140
00:12:42,058 --> 00:12:45,601
福尔摩斯先生 法国人欠你一个人情
Mr. Holmes, France owes you a great debt.

141
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,562
我们还没有抓住这个人 更重要的是
We have not got the man and more important,

142
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,500
那副画也没找到
the painting.

143
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,690
但是 他必须马上被逮捕
But he must be arrested immediately.

144
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:54,045
他很有可能已经把画卖了
He may have already sold it.

145
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:56,130
不 不 先生们 我相信
No, no, gentlemen it is my belief

146
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,215
那幅画还在门德萨手上
that the painting is still in Mendosa's keeping.

147
00:12:58,251 --> 00:13:01,757
他只是大阴谋中的其中一粒小棋子
He is only a pawn in a much bigger game.

148
00:13:03,634 --> 00:13:06,135
偷窃是经过周密计划的
This robbery has been carefully planned

149
00:13:06,173 --> 00:13:08,845
策划者已计划了数月甚至数年
over months, even years by a master criminal.

150
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:10,617
但什么样的职业罪犯
But what professional criminal would want

151
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,389
会想要拥有蒙娜丽莎呢?
to own the Mona Lisa?

152
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:13,535
真是疯狂
That is madness.

153
00:13:13,573 --> 00:13:15,099
他又不能卖掉
He can't sell it.

154
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:17,183
我相信这个犯罪头目对原作
I believe the master criminal is not interested

155
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,435
没有兴趣
in the original,

156
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:25,106
如果他能以赝品冒充原作
if he can pass off the forgeries as originals

157
00:13:25,142 --> 00:13:26,356
以相同价格出售
for the same price.

158
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:30,942
先生们 我们必须警告门德萨
Gentlemen we must alarm Mendosa,

159
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:34,590
让他行动起来 带领我们
get him on the move so he leads us

160
00:13:34,628 --> 00:13:36,676
走进这张犯罪网络的中心
to the center of the web.

161
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:37,926
但要怎样做呢?
But how?

162
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,782
首先 我们必须向世界宣布
First we must announce to the world

163
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,449
这幅画已经被偷了
that the painting has been stolen.

164
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:45,014
但是那会给
Oh, but that would create

165
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,244
我和警长带来莫大的丑闻
a great scandal both myself and the director of...

166
00:13:48,282 --> 00:13:50,330
部长 请听我解释
Minister, please if I may explain.

167
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:54,916
同时还宣布 凭借你和警长的智慧
It would be announced that owing to the brilliant

168
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:57,833
以及不懈的努力
and tireless efforts of yourself and the director,

169
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,170
罪犯即将落网
that the criminal is about to be arrested.

170
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:20,452
福尔摩斯先生 我们必须现在就逮捕他
Mr. Holmes, we must arrest him now.

171
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:21,494
不
No.

172
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,646
现在
Now!

173
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:13,818
福尔摩斯 我明白无论复制品多么优秀
Holmes, I understand that the recovery of the original

174
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:16,424
只要原作一找回
would make it impossible for the thieves to sell

175
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:19,655
窃贼就无法出售复制品
any copies however excellent those copies were,

176
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:22,260
但是 你到底有没有任何关于
but did you have any clue to the identity

177
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,074
这个阴谋主使者的线索?
of the mastermind behind the whole scheme?

178
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:28,202
我很庆幸我认识
I was satisfied that I had recognized one of

179
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:30,599
莫里亚蒂教授的代理人之一
Professor Moriarity's agents.

180
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,475
莫里亚蒂?
Moriarity?

181
00:15:57,178 --> 00:16:01,138
请注意这画对人物特征的精妙刻画
Notice the subtle modeling of the features,

182
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,328
美丽的双手
beautiful hands,

183
00:16:03,745 --> 00:16:04,891
安详的神情
mood,

184
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:06,871
那微笑
that smile.

185
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:11,979
如同华特・培顿所形容的
As Walter Payton described her, 

186
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:15,836
美颜在上 世界黯然失色
the head upon which all the ends of the world are common.

187
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,336
眼睑有一丝疲倦
The eyelids are a little weary.

188
00:16:18,374 --> 00:16:19,588
没有人拥有
No one else has ever had 

189
00:16:19,625 --> 00:16:23,548
如此出神入化的绘画技巧 除了达・芬奇
the genius to paint this masterpiece except De Vinci.

190
00:16:23,967 --> 00:16:26,884
再来看看这幅画作
But if you look at the paint work sir.

191
00:16:27,302 --> 00:16:32,798
里奥纳多飘逸的签名 笔工精湛
Leonard's signature at large, the brush work,

192
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:35,431
收放自如 技巧娴熟
the bloom, the technique.

193
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,183
不好意思 失陪
Will you excuse me?

194
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,980
我可以肯定地告诉你
I would say without hesitation that the general opinion

195
00:16:49,018 --> 00:16:51,378
这是艺术节公认的
of the art world is that this

196
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:54,506
世上最伟大的肖像作品
is the greatest portrait ever painted.

197
00:17:18,687 --> 00:17:21,188
我很遗憾地告诉你 先生
I very much regret to have to tell you sir

198
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:26,296
这画我们不卖了
that this painting is no longer for sale.

199
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:29,109
我不明白 教授
I don't understand Professor.

200
00:17:29,147 --> 00:17:31,403
难道是价格太低吗?
I mean, the price maybe?

201
00:17:31,716 --> 00:17:33,800
我可以重新考虑
Well now look, I'll reconsider.

202
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:38,489
我会付你4百万 怎么样?
I'll give you a cool four million and how's that?

203
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,366
我很抱歉 沃克先生
I'm sorry Mr. Walker,

204
00:17:41,723 --> 00:17:44,953
这画现在是非卖品
the painting is no longer for sale.

205
00:17:46,726 --> 00:17:49,539
嘿 你们这帮人在搞什么啊?
Hey, what you guys up to?

206
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,041
把你的脏手拿开 你个混蛋!
Take your hands off me you nick!

207
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,229
谢谢你们浪费时间
Thanks for nothing.

208
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,463
那个该死的福尔摩斯已经找回原作了
That wretched Holmes has recovered the original.

209
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,111
这些东西都是垃圾了
These are worthless.

210
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,614
毁了他们
Destroy them,

211
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,282
烧掉
burn them.

212
00:18:14,138 --> 00:18:15,388
你亲自做
Do it yourself,

213
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:17,785
不要让任何人看见
and let no one else see you.

214
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,557
遵命 莫里亚蒂教授
Yes, Professor Moriarity.

215
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,374
恭喜你 福尔摩斯
I must congratulate you, Holmes.

216
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:02,188
这等荣誉是你应得的
Such an honor and so well deserved.

217
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,125
我其实也没做什么
There was no great problem.

218
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:05,419
这个案子基本上是自动解决的
The case practically solved itself.

219
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:10,527
我听说你今天早上有个拜访者
I hear you had a visitor this morning.

220
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:11,673
噢!
Ow!

221
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,425
我回到贝克街
I had not been back in Baker Street

222
00:19:15,463 --> 00:19:17,823
刚坐下不到半小时 就在这时...
more than half an hour when...

223
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:20,741
你不能上去 先生!
But you cannot go up there sir!

224
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:47,425
你的前额
You have less frontal development

225
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:49,300
不如我想象中那样发达
than I should have expected.

226
00:19:49,823 --> 00:19:53,470
摆弄睡衣口袋里子弹上膛的手枪
It's a dangerous habit, a finger loaded firearms

227
00:19:53,506 --> 00:19:55,344
是一个危险的习惯
in the pocket of one's dressing gown.

228
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,550
你显然不了解我
You evidentially don't know me.

229
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:25,468
恰恰相反 我认为我对你十分了解
On the contrary I think it's fairly evident that I do.

230
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:31,931
如果有什么话要说 我可以给你5分钟
I can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.

231
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:37,872
我所要说的你都已经心知肚明了
All that I have to say has already crossed your mind.

232
00:20:39,853 --> 00:20:42,666
而我的回答你也已经心知肚明
And possibly my answer has already crossed yours.

233
00:20:42,703 --> 00:20:44,333
你决不让步?
You stand fast?

234
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,689
绝不
Absolutely.

235
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,428
在法国一事上
You frustrated me in the affair

236
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:02,887
你妨碍了我
of the French gold.

237
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:07,786
原来红头联盟的幕后黑手是你啊
So it was you behind the Red Headed League.

238
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,642
真是一个极具创造性和挑战性的点子啊
A very ingenious and welcome tried idea.

239
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:15,603
你抬举我了
High praise from you.

240
00:21:19,148 --> 00:21:21,857
1月4日你阻碍过我行事
You crossed my path first on the 4th of January.

241
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,983
2月中旬你给我制造了很大麻烦
By the middle of February I was seriously inconvenienced

242
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,859
而在3月底
by you and at the end of March

243
00:21:26,897 --> 00:21:29,673
你完全破坏了我的计划
I was absolutely hampered in my plans.

244
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:32,593
现在你又妨碍了我在法国的最后一桩买卖
And now with this last business in France you have placed me

245
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,616
你的不断阻挠 使我面临
in such a position by your continual persecution

246
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:39,472
有丧失自由的危险
that I am in positive danger of losing my liberty.

247
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:47,603
事情已经是忍无可忍了
The situation is becoming an impossible one.

248
00:21:49,687 --> 00:21:51,667
你有什么打算吗?
Have you any suggestion to make?

249
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:57,400
你必须住手 福尔摩斯先生
You must drop it Mr. Holmes.

250
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,110
你知道 你真的必须住手
You really must you know.

251
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,716
如果我拒绝了呢?
And what if I refuse?

252
00:22:03,967 --> 00:22:05,947
我确信 一个如你般智慧的人
I'm quite sure that a man of your intelligence

253
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:10,116
可以预见 这件事情只能有一个结果
will see that there can be but one outcome to this affair.

254
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:13,242
那就是你必须住手
It is necessary that you should withdraw.

255
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,327
你把事情做绝了
You have worked things in such a fashion

256
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:18,349
我们只剩下这一种办法
that we have only one resource left.

257
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:22,416
看到你把这件事搅成这个样子
It has been an intellectual treat to me to see

258
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:25,124
这对我来说简直是智力上的一种乐事
the way in which you grappled with this matter.

259
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:30,024
坦白说 如果我被迫采取任何极端措施
But I say unaffectedly that it would be a grief to me

260
00:22:30,061 --> 00:22:34,193
对我来说 那是令人痛心的
to be forced to take an extreme measure.

261
00:22:35,862 --> 00:22:37,633
你笑吧 先生
Oh, you smile sir

262
00:22:39,614 --> 00:22:42,115
可是我向你保证 那真是令人痛心的
but it really would I do assure you.

263
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:44,720
干我们这行危险是不可避免的
Danger is part of my trade.

264
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:48,264
这不是危险
This is not danger.

265
00:22:48,682 --> 00:22:50,974
这是不可避免的毁灭
It is inevitable destruction.

266
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,893
你所阻挠的不单是一个人
You stand in the way not merely of an individual

267
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,394
而是一个强大的组织 其雄厚力量
but of a mighty organization, the full extent of which

268
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,522
即使是用尽你所有的智慧
even you with all your cleverness have been

269
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,501
也无法完全了解
unable to realize.

270
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,316
你必须站开点 福尔摩斯先生
You must stand clear Mr. Holmes 

271
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:07,025
否则就会惹祸上身
or be trouble under foot.

272
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,778
恐怕由于我们谈得太起劲
You know I'm afraid that in the pleasure

273
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:13,280
我会把别处
of this conversation I am neglecting business

274
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:17,449
等我去办的重要事情给耽搁了
of importance which awaits me elsewhere.

275
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:26,831
好吧 好吧 真遗憾
Well, well, it seems a pity

276
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:30,791
但是我已经仁至义尽
but I've done what I could.

277
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:48,822
这是你死我活的一场决斗 福尔摩斯先生
This is a duel between you and me Mr. Holmes.

278
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:53,721
你想把我置于被告席上
You hope to place me in the dark.

279
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,597
你想击败我
You hope to beat me.

280
00:23:56,641 --> 00:24:00,601
如果你的聪明足以使我遭到毁灭
If you are clever enough to bring destruction on me,

281
00:24:00,638 --> 00:24:06,437
请放心好了 你会与我同归于尽的
rest assured I shall do as much for you.

282
00:24:14,568 --> 00:24:18,319
你过奖了
You have paid me several compliments,

283
00:24:18,357 --> 00:24:20,613
莫里亚蒂先生
Mr. Moriarity.

284
00:24:22,073 --> 00:24:25,303
让我也来回敬你一句吧
Let me pay you one in return when I say that if

285
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,055
如果能保证毁灭你
I were assured of the former eventuality

286
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,391
为了社会的利益
I would, in the interests of the public,

287
00:24:32,428 --> 00:24:35,518
即使和你同归于尽 我也心甘情愿
cheerfully accept the later.

288
00:24:38,124 --> 00:24:42,188
我答应与你同归于尽 但不是你毁灭我
I can promise you the one but not the other.

289
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:24,090
他是犯罪界的拿破仑 华生
He is the Napoleon of crime Watson.

290
00:25:24,507 --> 00:25:26,278
几年来 我一直在努力
For years I have endeavored

291
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,780
抽丝剥茧
to break through the veil which shrouded him

292
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:35,139
终于 我抓住了一条线索
and at last I have seized a thread

293
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,099
跟着它找到了莫里亚蒂本人
and followed it to Moriarity himself.

294
00:25:41,914 --> 00:25:44,102
现在 我已经撒好网等着将他绳之以法
And now I'm ready to close on him.

295
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:47,645
如果他没有先抓住你的话
If he doesn't close upon you first.

296
00:25:54,526 --> 00:26:00,257
在下星期一 时机就成熟了
On Monday next, matters will be right

297
00:26:01,718 --> 00:26:04,427
教授和他那一帮主要党羽
but the Professor and all the principal members

298
00:26:04,464 --> 00:26:07,345
就要全部落入警察手中
of his gang will be in the hands of the police.

299
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:14,016
那时就会进行本世纪最大的刑事审判
Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century,

300
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,935
40多起疑案即将破获
the clearing up of over 40 mysteries

301
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:18,809
他们将全部被判处绞刑
and the room full of them.

302
00:26:21,521 --> 00:26:25,168
在逮捕前这几天
I cannot do better than to get away

303
00:26:25,206 --> 00:26:26,628
我显然以离开此地为妙
for the few remaining days.

304
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,503
如果你愿意与我同去欧洲旅行一番
It would give me great pleasure Watson if you would come

305
00:26:28,541 --> 00:26:29,963
那我就太高兴了
onto the continent with me.

306
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,569
去欧洲?
The continent?

307
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,071
我很高兴同你去 福尔摩斯 但是去哪?
I'd be delighted Holmes, but where?

308
00:26:35,384 --> 00:26:36,217
随便那里
Anywhere.

309
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:37,781
对我来说都一样
It's all the same to me.

310
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:39,448
是的 但是 我们难道不应该
Yes, but won't we have to dispose of

311
00:26:39,485 --> 00:26:41,427
先处理完莫里亚蒂教授的事吗?
Professor Moriarity first?

312
00:26:42,472 --> 00:26:45,702
已经有人盯上这里了
It seems to me that we're under siege in this very room.

313
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:51,955
这提醒我 我必须该上路了
And that reminds me I must be on my way.

314
00:26:52,165 --> 00:26:53,623
你不留一夜?
Won't you stay the night?

315
00:26:53,937 --> 00:26:56,021
不 如果我留宿的话会给你造成危险的
No, it's too dangerous for you if I stay here.

316
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:07,486
我会按原路返回并且回住处
I will leave the way I came and find lodgings

317
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:09,154
找我的哥哥 迈克罗夫特
with my brother Mycroft.

318
00:27:09,191 --> 00:27:10,613
我们明早动身
We start tomorrow morning.

319
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,969
明天早晨?
Tomorrow morning?

320
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,366
是的 一刻也不能耽搁
Oh, yes, it is most necessary.

321
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:18,431
这些就是给你的指令 我请你
Now here are your instructions and I beg of you

322
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:19,890
一定要不折不扣地遵照执行
to follow them to the letter.

323
00:27:19,995 --> 00:27:22,287
现在我俩正在同
We are now playing a double-handed game with me,

324
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:25,101
欧洲最有势力的犯罪集团
Watson against the most powerful syndicate

325
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,081
作殊死的决斗
of criminals in Europe.

326
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,749
不管你打算带什么样的行李
You will dispatch whatever luggage

327
00:27:28,787 --> 00:27:31,251
不要写地址 并于今夜派一个可靠的人
you intend to take by a trusted messenger unaddressed

328
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,919
送往维多利亚车站
at the Victoria Station tonight.

329
00:27:33,024 --> 00:27:36,359
明天一早 你叫哈德森太太雇辆高级马车
In the morning you will send Mrs. Hudson for a handsome cab,

330
00:27:38,965 --> 00:27:40,945
吩咐她不要雇第一辆
desiring her not to take the first

331
00:27:40,982 --> 00:27:43,238
和第二辆主动来揽生意的马车
or second which may present itself.

332
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:49,387
用纸条写个地址交给车夫
You will drive to the Strand end of La Famules,

333
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:51,367
上面写着驶往劳瑟街斯特兰德尽头处
handing the address to the cabman

334
00:27:51,682 --> 00:27:54,183
吩咐他不要丢掉纸条
but with a request that he will not throw it away.

335
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,738
你要事先把车费付清
Have your fare ready and the instant that your cab

336
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:22,949
马车一停 马上穿过街道
stops move speedily through the muse and time yourself

337
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:26,806
于9:15到达街的另一端
to reach the other end at exactly a quarter past 9:00

338
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:31,497
你会见到一辆四轮轿式小马车等在街边
where you will find a small broom waiting close to the curb

339
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:34,102
驾车的人的人披深黑色斗篷
driven by a fellow with a heavy black coat,

340
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:36,292
领子是红色镶边的
tipped at the collar with red.

341
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:39,835
上了车 便能及时赶到维多利亚车站
Into this you will stay and you will reach Victoria

342
00:28:39,872 --> 00:28:42,544
搭乘开往欧洲大陆的快车
in time for the continental express.

343
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,160
打扰 先生 你会说意大利语吗?
Excuse me sir, I wonder if you speak Italian.

344
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:00,993
很遗憾 我不会
No, I'm afraid not.

345
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,079
我在找预定了这件隔间的先生
I'm looking for the gentleman who reserved this compartment.

346
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,016
没有看到他 先生
Not a sign of him sir.

347
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:06,102
如果你要旅行 你最好快上车
If you're traveling you better get aboard.

348
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:52,588
我亲爱的华生 你还没有屈尊
My dear Watson you haven't even condescended

349
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,359
向我道早安呢
to say good morning to me.

350
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:04,053
天哪 福尔摩斯 你可把我吓着了
Good heavens Holmes, how you startled me.

351
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,431
严密防范依然是必要的
It is still necessary to take every precaution.

352
00:30:30,946 --> 00:30:32,821
看来我做得很好 华生
I did rather fine, Watson.

353
00:31:01,173 --> 00:31:03,882
既然这是快车 而且又和轮船联运
I see that this express runs in connection with the boat

354
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,425
我想我们已经成功地把莫里亚蒂甩掉了
so I think we've shaken off Moriarity very effectively.

355
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:11,178
他能怎么办呢?
Well what will he do then?

356
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,429
我能怎么办 他就能怎么办
What I should do.

357
00:31:13,681 --> 00:31:15,556
定一辆专列
Engage a special train.

358
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:17,745
可是那一定太晚了
But he'll arrive too late.

359
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:20,871
你看看火车时刻表就会知道
You'll observe from your Bradshaw that this train

360
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:23,269
这趟车要在坎特伯雷站停车
stops at Canterbury and again at the boat.

361
00:31:23,374 --> 00:31:25,458
莫里亚蒂会在码头上抓住我们
Moriarity will catch us there.

362
00:31:27,544 --> 00:31:30,461
天哪 那别人还以为我们是罪犯呢
Good heavens anybody would think that we were the criminals.

363
00:31:30,983 --> 00:31:33,171
我们何不在他来到时先逮捕他
Let's arrest him as soon as he arrives.

364
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,298
不 那会前功尽弃的
No, that would ruin everything.

365
00:31:37,236 --> 00:31:39,216
如果我们先抓住了大鱼
If we should catch the big fish then the smaller

366
00:31:39,253 --> 00:31:40,883
那些小鱼就会横冲直撞 脱网而逃
would dart right and left out of the net.

367
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:44,427
不 不 许多余党还未浮出水面
No, no, and the rest is invisible.

368
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:47,033
那我们该怎么办?
Well what then?

369
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:52,870
我们要在坎特伯雷下车
We shall get ours at Canterbury.

370
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:13,090
那我们的行李怎么办
But Holmes our luggage.

371
00:32:14,447 --> 00:32:16,948
我们必须给莫里亚蒂留点线索
We must give Moriarity something to follow.

372
00:32:17,678 --> 00:32:18,928
然后呢?
What will we do?

373
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,785
我们作横贯全国的旅行
We shall go across country.

374
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,146
我们到了 福尔摩斯
Here we are Holmes,

375
00:32:34,183 --> 00:32:36,021
列车表从来不会让你失望的
Bradshaw shouldn't let you down.

376
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:40,400
在阿什福德中转站 我们可以搭1点的慢车
From Ashford Junction we can take a 1:00 slow train

377
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:43,631
到达哈斯汀 然后到达亲爱的
to Hastings, then onto the dear old

378
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:46,758
老伦敦布莱顿和南海岸线
London Brighton and South Coast line,

379
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,093
驶过巴克斯山直达刘易斯
Bax Hill on to Lewis non-stop,

380
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,760
之后到达纽黑文
then onto New Haven,

381
00:32:51,798 --> 00:32:53,532
坐晚班船去维也纳
evening boat to Vienna.

382
00:32:54,054 --> 00:32:56,034
我想我们可以提前吃午餐
I think we've got time for an early lunch.

383
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:04,477
太快了
So soon.

384
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,684
你看 我们朋友的智力毕竟有限
There are limits you see to even our friend's intelligence.

385
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:42,938
现在 华生 我们该给自己
And now Watson, we shall treat ourselves

386
00:33:42,975 --> 00:33:46,377
买两个毡睡袋 以便鼓励下
for a couple of carpet bags, encourage the manufacturers,

387
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:49,192
沿途国家的睡袋商
the countries through which we travel and make our way

388
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:52,423
然后从容自在地经过卢森堡
at leisure into Switzerland

389
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:56,488
和巴塞尔 到瑞士一游
via Brussels, Luxemberg...

390
00:33:58,574 --> 00:34:01,387
一切都如夏洛克・福尔摩斯所预料
It fell out as Sherlock Holmes had predicted.

391
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:03,993
我们在布鲁塞尔住了两晚
We stayed two nights in Brussels,

392
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:07,745
然后悠闲地向东南方向继续旅行
then began to make our leisurely way southeast.

393
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:09,517
度过了美妙的一周
For a charming week

394
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:11,706
我们开始向阿尔卑斯山进发
we progressed towards the Alps.

395
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,161
你如何看待?
What do you think?

396
00:34:41,934 --> 00:34:44,747
山石坠落是常有的事
A common enough occurrence in the mountains.

397
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:23,522
啊 没有比在酒的生产地品酒更惬意的了
Ah, nothing like drinking the wine where it's grown.

398
00:35:29,671 --> 00:35:30,817
嗯
Hmm.

399
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,468
所有党羽都已抓获 只有莫里亚蒂逃脱了
All gang safely secured, only Moriarity escaped the net,

400
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,823
迈克罗夫特写来的
signed Mycroft.

401
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,992
他溜走了
He's given them the slip.

402
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,143
我想最好
I think it would be better if you were to

403
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:52,913
你还是回英国去 华生
return to England Watson.

404
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:56,458
为什么?
Why?

405
00:35:57,084 --> 00:35:59,897
现在你和我作伴已经很危险了
You will find me a very dangerous companion now.

406
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:06,152
莫里亚蒂会竭尽全力
Moriarity will devote all his energies to taking his

407
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:09,069
报复我 而如果我有个同伴...
revenge upon me and if I have a companion...

408
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,634
你想甩我?
Would you be rid of me?

409
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,220
不 但这次是迫不得已
No, except for the reasons I've given.

410
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:19,910
我们已经经历过许多磨难
We've been in tight places before together.

411
00:36:21,682 --> 00:36:23,244
但没有一个像这次这样艰难
Never as tight as this one.

412
00:36:24,393 --> 00:36:26,581
我不会离开你 的 福尔摩斯
I'm not leaving you Holmes,

413
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:29,499
除非你命令我离开
not unless you order me to go.

414
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:42,214
我以前从没来过瑞士
I've never been to Switzerland before

415
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:45,239
但是这些美景使我不由自主地想起
but the beauty of the landscape reminded me irresistibly

416
00:36:45,275 --> 00:36:48,051
那些印度西北边境的省区
of the northwest frontier provinces of India.

417
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:53,264
但是 尽管周围的景色如此优美
But in spite of the lovely scenery all around us,

418
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,869
我心里非常清楚 夏洛克・福尔摩斯
it was clear to me that never for one instant

419
00:36:55,907 --> 00:36:58,059
心中的阴影
did Sherlock Holmes forget the shadow

420
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,518
一刻都没有消失过
that lay across him.

421
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:00,701
我可以从他警惕的神情中看出
I could tell by his sharp scrutiny of every face

422
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:04,037
他非常清楚 无论我们走到那里
that he was well convinced that go where we would

423
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,330
危险都会一直尾随
we would not be clear of the danger

424
00:38:06,366 --> 00:38:09,142
绝不会消除
that was dogging our footsteps.

425
00:38:56,569 --> 00:38:57,715
那是什么?
What was that?

426
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:22,418
看见什么了吗?
See anything?

427
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:24,606
不 什么都没
No, nothing.

428
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:27,108
是时候继续上路了
It's time we went on our way.

429
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:30,652
汉斯 我们上路了
Hans, we're on our way.

430
00:39:44,203 --> 00:39:48,372
最后我们到达了博那斯小镇的心脏地带
At last we reached the heart of the burnice overland

431
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:50,561
来到了迈林根的一个小村镇
and came to the village of Mirengland

432
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,061
我们在"大英旅馆"下榻
where we put up at the Englisher Hall

433
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,188
旅馆的主人是老彼得・斯太勒
then kept by Peter Steiler the Elder.

434
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,032
啊 斯太勒?
Uh, Steiler?

435
00:41:25,098 --> 00:41:30,413
翻山到达罗森洛依 一路上的风景迷人
The walk over to the hills to Rosenlawry is very beautiful.

436
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,478
你们可以在那过夜 第二天再回来
You can stay the night there and come back the next day

437
00:41:34,584 --> 00:41:38,231
不要错过莱辛巴赫瀑布
but you must not on any account miss

438
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:43,025
可以稍微绕一些路去欣赏一番
the falls of Reichenbach which is only a small detour.

439
00:41:43,062 --> 00:41:45,630
啊 就是那了
Uh, there it is.

440
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,279
那确实是一个险恶的地方
It is indeed a fearful place.

441
00:42:22,113 --> 00:42:25,864
融雪汇成激流
The torrent, swollen by the melting glacier,

442
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:31,909
倾泻进万丈深渊 水花高溅
plunges into a tremendous abyss in which the spray rose up

443
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:34,411
宛如房屋失火时冒出的浓烟
like the smoke from a burning house.

444
00:42:55,049 --> 00:42:56,820
华生医生
Herr, Dr. Watson.

445
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,198
华生医生
Herr, Dr. Watson.

446
00:43:03,909 --> 00:43:05,367
华生医生
Herr, Dr. Watson.

447
00:43:05,577 --> 00:43:06,931
什么事?
Yes?

448
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:09,641
斯太勒先生让我把这个交给你
Herr Steiler told me to give you this.

449
00:43:10,058 --> 00:43:11,620
非常紧急
It is very urgent.

450
00:43:14,437 --> 00:43:17,042
好像是一个英国妇女在我们离开以后
It seems an English woman was taken to the hotel

451
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:20,169
被送到了旅馆 她正要去卢塞恩访友
after we left on her way to friends in Lucerne.

452
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,836
不料她突然咯血
She's had a great hemorrhage.

453
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,712
是肺结核
Tuberculoses.

454
00:43:23,922 --> 00:43:25,172
那是肯定的
Oh, no doubt.

455
00:43:26,423 --> 00:43:27,881
她颇有生命危险
It appears she's dying.

456
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:32,051
如有位英国医生为她诊治 她会十分欣慰
An English doctor would be a great consolation.

457
00:43:32,088 --> 00:43:33,718
恐怕我必须回去了 福尔摩斯
I'm afraid I must go back Holmes.

458
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:34,970
那是当然
Of course.

459
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:39,034
斯太勒还建议你让这个小伙子给你带路
Steiler suggests that this lad shows you the way

460
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:42,058
去罗森洛依 我稍后和你们会合
to Rosenlawy and I'll join you there later.

461
00:43:42,094 --> 00:43:43,620
不错的计划
A good plan.

462
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:12,805
嘿!
Hey!

463
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:00,959
她病情没有恶化吧?
I trust she's no worse.

464
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:02,315
?????
?????

465
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,051
你没有写这封信吗?
You didn't write this?

466
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:19,825
旅馆里没有一位生病的英国女人吗?
There is no sick English woman at the hotel?

467
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,994
可是这上面有旅馆的印章
No, but it has the hotel mark.

468
00:45:24,725 --> 00:45:27,851
当然 这一定是那高个子英国人写的
Of course, there was a tall old Englishman

469
00:45:27,888 --> 00:45:29,936
他在你们走之后过来的
who came here after you had gone.

470
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:30,978
他说
He said...

471
00:46:45,191 --> 00:46:47,275
看到登山杖
It was the sight of the Alpine stalk

472
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:50,818
不由使我不寒而栗
that turned me cold and sick.

473
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:53,945
他并没有去罗森洛依
He had not gone to Rosenlawy.

474
00:46:55,614 --> 00:46:58,219
我在那站了一两分钟 平复自己的心情
I stood for a minute or two to collect myself

475
00:46:58,257 --> 00:47:02,389
因为我被这件事吓昏了头
for I was dazed with the horror of the thing.

476
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:08,226
然后开始想起福尔摩斯的方法
And then I began to think of Holmes' own methods

477
00:47:08,852 --> 00:47:11,040
竭力运用它去查明这场悲剧
and to try to practice them.

478
00:47:16,043 --> 00:47:17,710
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

479
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:23,026
福尔摩斯
Holmes,

480
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:28,967
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

481
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:06,595
我亲爱的华生 承蒙莫里亚蒂先生的好意
My Dear Watson, I write these few lines

482
00:48:06,632 --> 00:48:08,888
我写下这几行书信
through the courtesy of Mr. Moriarity

483
00:48:09,097 --> 00:48:11,806
他正等着对我们之间存在的问题
who awaits my convenience for the final discussion

484
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:14,412
进行最后的讨论
of those questions which lie between us.

485
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,913
我一想到我能为社会除掉
I'm pleased to think that I shall be able

486
00:48:16,951 --> 00:48:20,874
由于他的存在而带来的祸害 就很高兴
to free society from any further affects of his presence.

487
00:48:21,501 --> 00:48:24,002
虽然 这恐怕要以给我的朋友们
Though I fear that it is at a cost

488
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:26,710
带来痛苦为代价
which will give pain to my friends

489
00:48:27,442 --> 00:48:29,630
尤其是给你 我亲爱的华生
and especially my dear Watson,

490
00:48:31,611 --> 00:48:33,069
带来悲哀
to you.

491
00:48:35,258 --> 00:48:39,322
正如你所知 我的生涯已经
As you know, my career had in any case

492
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:40,783
到了紧要关头
reached a crisis.

493
00:48:41,513 --> 00:48:44,535
而对我而言 没有比这
And no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial

494
00:48:44,572 --> 00:48:46,410
更令我心满意足的结局了
to me than this.

495
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,684
诚然 如果我对你彻底坦白说
Indeed if I may make a full confession to you,

496
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,916
我早就知道那封信
I was convinced that the letter...

497
00:48:53,952 --> 00:48:55,374
是一场骗局
was a hoax.

498
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,022
在离开英国时
I made every disposition of my property

499
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,586
我已将薄产作了处理
before leaving England

500
00:49:00,623 --> 00:49:03,191
并已付与我兄迈克罗夫特
and handed it to my brother Mycroft.

501
00:49:03,818 --> 00:49:06,631
再见 好运
Good bye and good luck

502
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,863
你是我最亲爱的朋友
and believe me to be my dear fellow,

503
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,824
你忠诚的夏洛克 福尔摩斯
very sincerely yours, Sherlock Holmes.

504
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:26,956
毫无疑问 在这种情况下
In this situation I have little doubt

505
00:49:26,994 --> 00:49:29,562
那两人之间的斗争
that a personal contest between the two men

506
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:33,315
已经结束 因为它已无法继续
ended as it could hardly fail to end.

507
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,608
啊!
Ahh!

508
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:32,242
我怀着无比沉重的心情提起笔
It's with a heavy heart that I take up my pen

509
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:37,349
最后写下我的朋友
to write these last words in which I shall ever record

510
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:41,727
福尔摩斯先生所拥有的
singular gifts by which my friend

511
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,229
卓越才能
Mr. Sherlock Holmes was distinguished.

512
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:49,440
我会永远把他视为
I shall ever regard him

513
00:51:50,692 --> 00:51:53,297
我所知道的
as the best and wisest man

514
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:54,549
最优秀 最睿智的人
I have ever known.

515
