And I heard since he broke up with Maeve,
he'll basically have sex with anyone.

180
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,560
- Oh, he's not really my type.
- No one's ever your type.

181
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
- You're so picky, Florence.
- [girl] Yeah.

182
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,840
[exhales]

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,600
[indistinct conversation]

184
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,160
[door closes]

185
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,520
[Jean] The shade is called "Lustering."

186
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Oh, it's just gorgeous.

187
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,920
- I'll write it down.
- No, um...

188
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,880
- You can keep it.
- Oh.

189
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,320
That's very kind. Thank you.

190
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
Are you sure there wasn't anything else
you wanted to talk to me about?

191
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,480
This is a safe space.

192
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,440
[sighs] Well...

193
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,880
Sometimes I feel like
my life is moving by so quickly.

194
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
I can't help thinking,

195
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,440
"Am I really going to die
sleeping next to a man..."

196
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,600
[sniffs]

197
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,840
...who hasn't touched me...

198
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,880
properly...

199
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,600
"in nearly six years?"

200
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
It is a dilemma that many couples face.

201
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,840
It is possible to reignite passion.

202
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
What would you suggest?

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,600
Well, can you...

204
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
start by telling me
a bit about your relationship?

205
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,480
[exhales nervously]

206
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,520
[grunting]

207
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,600
[grunts]

208
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,960
[sighs]

209
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,280
[Otis] Do you have condoms?
I didn't bring any, which was stupid.

210
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,520
I can go home and get some or ask my mum.

211
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,400
Mm. Don't ask your mum.

212
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Okay, yeah. That's...

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,000
- It's okay. I'll get some.
- ...a bit weird.

214
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
- Hey, arsehat.
- Hey.

215
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,760
Hi. Sorry to interrupt,
it's just clinic stuff.

216
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,080
Cool.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,200
See you tonight.

218
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey! Okay.

219
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,440
What's happening tonight?

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,680
Nothing unusual.

221
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,720
We're just hanging out. You know,

222
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,960
- boyfriend, girlfriend, hang times.
- Cool.

223
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,360
You've got a 3:45 appointment.

224
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,480
Uh... Ooh. Uh...

225
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,160
- I'm not sure.
- Otis.

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,600
Your mum has taken all our clients.
Please just be there.

227
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
[phone ringing]

228
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Piss off, Erin.

229
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
[Otis] Who's Erin?

230
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
My mum. She's been staying with me.

231
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, that's a big deal.

232
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,360
Why didn't you say anything?

233
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,880
We don't really hang out anymore, Otis,
you're always with your girlfriend.

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Well, you could have told me.

235
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
It's fine.
Don't be late for the appointment.

236
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,760
- I need your help.
- I'm cramming here, Jackson.

237
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,280
But I've started rehearsals
and apparently, I'm bad at acting.

238
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,080
Hey. I need you to explain it to me
like you did for the audition.

239
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,640
[gasps] That was a onetime thing.

240
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
I'm here to help you
with English or maths,

241
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
not turn you into Olivier.

242
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,240
Who's Olivier? I'm playing Romeo.

243
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
[scoffs]

244
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,160
- Can I meet you later?
- No,

245
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,680
because I'm chairing that algebra group

246
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,360
and then I have to write a letter
to my Polynesian pen pals.

247
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,400
Other people do have lives too. Sorry.

248
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,280
- Hey, heats start in 20, right?
- [laughs] Yes, they do start in 20.

249
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,920
- [chuckles] Right, see you in a bit, Bev.
- See you in a bit, Dex.

250
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,960
[laughs]

251
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Did he just call you "Bev"?

252
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,440
That's Dex, he's on the quiz team.

253
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,120
Vivian Odusanya has a crush.

254
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,480
No, I don't. That was normal.

255
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,640
[Jackson] Mm.

256
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,560
- I am late.
- Hey.

257
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,280
Let's make a deal.
I'll help you get that weird guy

258
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,520
- if you help me with Shakespeare.
- No, thanks.

259
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,760
Come on. I can't humiliate myself
in front of the whole school.

260
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
Bev! Viv!

261
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,640
[bell ringing]

262
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,440
[Erin] I've been trying to call you.

263
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,480
Apparently, the queen of the caravan park
has had to take Jonathan to the vets,

264
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,040
so I need someone to look after Elsie.
I am late for my interview.

265
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,520
- I can't.
- Please, please, Frogface.

266
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,880
If I get this job,
I can get us a proper flat.

267
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,040
A new start for you, for me, for Els.

268
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,400
- Fine.
- You are a gem.

269
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,920
- Okay.
- She's going to drop off any minute.

270
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,720
- [sighs]
- [Elsie babbling]

271
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,200
Christ.

272
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,000
[indistinct background chatter]

273
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,720
She's gonna get us disqualified.

274
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,720
Look how smug Let's Get Quizzy are.
Makes me sick.

275
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,200
[blows kiss]

276
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
- Hey.
- Hi.

277
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,360
Nice bow tie.

278
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,000
- Who's that?
- That's Elsie, she's my sister. Sort of.

279
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,320
She's mainly a dickhead.

280
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
[chuckles]

281
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,160
Your mum's back and you have a sister.

282
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,120
Yeah, I'm late for the quiz heats.
Could you take her with you

283
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,360
to your appointment?

284
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,840
I won't be long, and she'll stay asleep
and you can forget she's even there.

285
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,800
I don't really know how
to look after a child. Um...

286
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,800
Please.

287
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,920
Fine. Yeah.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,040
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked you.
It's fine.

289
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,680
Um... Yeah, I'll find someone else.

290
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,480
Uh, wait. Um...

291
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
I could... [sighs]

292
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
I can take her, yeah. I think.

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,360
- Yeah?
- It'll be fine, right?

294
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

295
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,800
Okay. Great, thank you. Thanks.

296
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,240
That's all right. Um, good luck.

297
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,120
Okay, Miss Sands,
we'll have to give the place

298
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,520
to Let's Get Quizzy by default if...

299
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Question number one...

300
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,040
[dog barking]

301
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,480
[dog barking]

302
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,280
[dog whimpers]

303
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,680
You dumb dog.

304
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,240
[dog whimpers]

305
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,760
- [door opens]
- [bell chimes]

306
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,600
Hi. You're new.

307
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,480
I work here too. I'm Ola.

308
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,160
Oh.

309
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,440
- Do you want to buy something?
- Yeah.

310
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,080
Uh, packet of condoms, please.

311
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,520
Didn't you used to go to my school?

312
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,920
I've just started,
so I think I just missed you.

313
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,320
Do you know Otis and Eric?

314
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,320
- [door opens]
- Not really.

315
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,440
- Hi, Ola.
- Hey.

316
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
- Is he a friend?
- Yeah, sort of.

317
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,400
He's kind of dating Eric.
They're so cute together, it's ridiculous.

318
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,240
Anyway, it was nice to meet you, Adam.

319
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I'll see you on my next shift. Cheers.

320
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
- [door opens then closes]
- [bell chimes]

321
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,560
[dog whimpers]

322
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,880
What are you looking at?

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,280
Hello?

324
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,960
Hi, Jeanie.

325
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,800
- Remi?
- Yeah, um...

326
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,160
Spare key's in the, uh...

327
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,200
in the flower pot by the door.
I hope you don't mind.

328
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,280
I didn't know you were in the country.

329
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,720
Last-minute book tour?

330
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Eh, no, just, uh... Just here to see Otis.

331
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,480
- I had a few days off, so...
- He's not here.

332
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,440
[inhales deeply]

333
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,240
- You could have called, Remi.
- Well, you know me, uh...

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,720
Mr. Spontaneous. [chuckles]

335
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,720
- How have you been, Jeanie?
- You know I hate it when you call me that.

336
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,560
Dr. Milburn.

337
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,560
[door opens then closes]

338
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,400
[Jakob] I hope you like trout.

339
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,360
This is Jakob, my...

340
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,920
Boyfriend.

341
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,440
And this is Remi, my...

342
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,880
Ex-husband.

343
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,480
[Jean] Great.

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,280
Now we've all met.

345
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,440
[stammers] I don't want to impose.

346
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,560
I'll head to the hotel
and see Otis in the morning...

347
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Would you like to stay for dinner?

348
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh, that's lovely. Thank you.

349
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,200
I need a drink.

350
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,160
[quizmaster] <i>Next question.</i>

351
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,520
What is the largest moon of Saturn?

352
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,960
Oh, I think it's Phobos.

353
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,600
I think maybe Mimas.

354
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,560
- Titan.
- Correct.

355
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,320
- Yes!
- [quizmaster] Next question.

356
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,360
Ascorbic acid is a form of which vitamin?

357
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,640
[bell rings]

358
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
- C.
- Correct.

359
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,520
- Yeah!
- Quite the one-woman team

360
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,040
you've got there, guys. Next question.

361
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,680
What is the name
of the highest mountain in Wales?

362
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,120
Why do you have a kid again?

363
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Um... Long story.

364
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,920
Come, sit. My office.

365
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,120
So, tell me what the problem is.

366
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
You've probably heard,
I'm playing Juliet in the school play.

367
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
Uh, congratulations.

368
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,400
Anyway, I thought it was a play about love
but apparently, it's all about sex.

369
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,000
And now, the whole cast
seem to be thinking about sex

370
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,840
every second of every day.

371
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,280
So... you're not ready to have sex

372
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
but you're feeling pressure
from your peers to keep up with them.

373
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't want to have sex.

374
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,920
But sometimes I think I should just do it,

375
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,640
so everyone'll shut up
and stop making me feel like a freak.

376
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,440
Well, try not to think about
what other people are doing.

377
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,000
Run your own race,
and when you meet the right person,

378
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sure you'll be ready.

379
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
You're worried these concerns
might affect your performance.

380
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,920
[chuckles]

381
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm the best actor in this school.

382
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
I'm basically Meryl Streep but young...

383
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
and Scottish.

384
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
[sighs]

385
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,320
I hope that helped and if you want
to talk some more about this,

386
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,840
then I'll be here.

387
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,840
Thanks for that.

388
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,600
- Okay. [exhales]
- [phone chimes]

389
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
Be there ASAP.

390
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
[exhales nervously] Okay.

391
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,400
Elsie.

392
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,280
Oh, shit.

393
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Elsie?

394
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,280
Elsie?

395
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Shit!

396
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,200
Final question.

397
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,640
Which country, with a land mass
of 9.6 million square kilometers,

398
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,040
has just one time zone?

399
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,520
- I think it's China.
- I think maybe...

400
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,680
Russia?

401
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,480
- [quizmaster] Incorrect.
- [groaning]

402
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,160
Let's Get Quizzy,
it's yours for the taking.

403
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
[conferring quietly]

404
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
Canada?

405
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,360
Incorrect. The answer is China.

406
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,920
- The Moordale Quiz Heads have won it...
- [exhales]

407
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,120
...by a hair with 68 points.

408
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,680
Whoo!

409
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,640
[cheering]

410
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,080
Congratulations.

411
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,840
Miss Sands,

412
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,360
we don't want Maeve on our team.

413
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,600
She doesn't know how to collaborate
as a group and we nearly lost.

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But we won.

415
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,360
Yeah, but we almost didn't, Maeve.

416
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Look, I need this for my school CV.

417
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,400
Is this is how you feel too, Steve?

418
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
Um...

419
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,920
- Yeah.
- Nice.

420
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
It's fine. I didn't want to be on
your stupid quiz team anyway.

421
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,360
Maeve...

422
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
[exhales]

423
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,560
[Otis, panting] Maeve.

424
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,480
- Where's Elsie?
- I don't know.

425
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,080
She was right here.
Then I sent a text, and she disappeared.

426
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,000
- Are you joking?
- No, I told you I can't look after kids.

427
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,440
Oh, sorry. Am I keeping you
from something really important?

428
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,480
Go then, piss off.

429
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,360
Maeve.

430
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,680
- Maeve!
- I'm going to look for my sister

431
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,960
that you lost.

432
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,200
[sighs] Okay.

433
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,560
I'm coming, Maeve. I'm coming.

434
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,000
Hey, let's be logical, Maeve.
Like, where's a three-year-old gonna go?

435
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Fuck being logical!
There's a child missing, she could be hurt

436
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
- or someone could have taken her.
- Why are you yelling?

437
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,400
Because everyone always lets me down.

438
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,320
Sorry.

439
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
[knocking at window]

440
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,960
[Otis] Go, go, go, go!

441
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,000
[Maeve] Elsie, no!

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,440
Give it here. Jesus Christ.

443
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,040
Oh.

444
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,480
[Otis] Right.

445
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,400
- Told you she's a dickhead.
- Yeah, she's kinda cute, though.

446
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,840
Uh...

447
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,160
Um...

448
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,520
Did you guys...
Did you make it through the heat?

449
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,880
Yep... but I got kicked out.

450
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
'Cause I mess everything up.

451
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
You don't mess everything up.

452
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,720
Anyway, that's their loss.

453
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,880
I've gotta go. I'm seeing Ola and...

454
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,480
I am really sorry
about losing Elsie. There's...

455
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
[sighs]

456
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,200
Yeah, you're a really shit babysitter.

457
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
[chuckles] Yeah.

458
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,720
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah.

459
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,800
I messed it up with you.

460
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,080
What?

461
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,280
There was this moment last term,
where I thought maybe you liked me...

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,360
and I liked you back.

463
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,840
Um, and I got scared,
so I didn't tell you how I felt.

464
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,040
And then you met Ola.

465
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
It's really hard seeing you
with her every day.

466
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,120
Why are you telling me this now?

467
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
Because it's true.

468
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,040
Why do you look angry?

469
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Because, Maeve, you can't...

470
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,120
That's not fair.

471
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,560
I liked you. I really liked you.

472
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,720
I fucking turned myself inside out
liking you.

473
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,640
- You did like me?
- Yes.

474
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,120
Of course I did.

475
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,560
- And now you're saying you felt the same.
- Yeah, it's... I was confused.

476
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,120
I have a girlfriend. I...

477
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,680
I made myself get over you, Maeve,

478
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,720
and now everything's fine,
everything's normal, everything's great.

479
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,880
I've gotta go.

480
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,360
Bad.

481
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
[chuckles]

482
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,920
Yeah,

483
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,400
that was bad.

484
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,160
[sighs]

485
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,200
[Jean] It was not 14 times.

486
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,200
Over the course of two years
postgrad together,

487
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,600
I had to ask her out 14 times.

488
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,240
And she was wildly untameable.

489
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,800
- Yes, I was.
- She still is.

490
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,640
Hmm.

491
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,760
So, um, how did you two meet?

492
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,360
[Jean] Jakob did some work on my house.

493
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,720
Oh, so... so you're an architect?

494
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,720
I'm a plumber.

495
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Right, right. Well, honorable work,
yeah, yeah.

496
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,920
Jakob has his own company.

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
Oh?

498
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,040
[chuckles]

499
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,800
You know what?

500
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
- I think I'm going to go home.
- [Jean] No, don't leave.

501
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,240
I have an early morning.
Lots of toilets to fix.

502
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,720
- Yeah.
- It's early. We haven't eaten yet.

503
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,000
I'll eat at home.

504
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,560
Leave you guys some space
to catch up about Otis.

505
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,040
- Nice to meet you.
- And you too, Jack... Jakob.

506
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,320
[Jakob] Catch you later.

507
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,040
[door opens]

508
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,520
- [door closes]
- What?

509
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,040
Your smugness is palpable.

510
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,760
Look, he seems very nice.

511
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,360
A practical man with big hands.

512
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
[sighs]

513
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,760
I'm content.

514
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,160
Yes, yes.

515
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,560
I can see that
and I am very happy for you.

516
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,720
[exhales forcefully]

517
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,720
[chuckles]

518
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,440
[laughs]

519
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,960
You're always so suspicious.

520
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,800
I-I am not here to disrupt your life.
I just want to spend

521
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,280
a little bit of time with our boy.

522
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:47,000
Our "boy" is almost a man, Remi.

523
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,720
- Lovely, look at that. Yeah.
- No.

524
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,480
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, go on. Just a tickle.

525
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,400
- No.
- For old time's sake.

526
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,760
[sighs]

527
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,640
A little bit, just a little bit.

What was military school like?

708
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,880
Well, I got kicked out, didn't I?

709
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,960
But... better than being back home.

710
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Did you have to do
those serious drill things?

[laughs]

712
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,200

I'm kind of glad you're back.

718
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,160
It's nearly morning. We should get going.

I'm glad I'm back too.

This was, um...

721
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,720
strange.

722
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay.

723
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,480
Bye.

724

He's being such a dick.

733
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,360
Eyelash.

734
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:43,880

735
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,400
You can talk to me

Even if you just want to be distracted.

737
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,120
I could speak Gamma Velorum to you.

739
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,000
That meant, "I made you something."

Oh.

741
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,360
[Ola] Oh, my goodness.

742
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,160
This is so cool.

743
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,840
Thank you. [chuckles]

744
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,680
I mean, there's no real secret to it,
it's just practice and practice.

[inhales]

746
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,760
Hey, Bev. You've got a little something
on your face there.

747
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,360
Thanks.

748
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,720
[chuckles]
It's avocado. I like it on toast.

749
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,600
[Dex] Anyway, the real secret is,
you've gotta know...

[indistinct conversation]

751
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,040

definitely don't do that.

- [boy] I mean...

754
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,600
Psst... Jackson...

755
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,800
Two secs.

756
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,920
- You all right?
- I'll teach you

757
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,800
- how to deliver a soliloquy...
- Oh.

758
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,520
...if you teach me how
to get jiggy with Dex.

759
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,040
- Did you just say "get jiggy"?
- It sounded better in my head.

760
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,360
Just... Just help me make him my, um...

761
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,240
- Boyfriend?
- Yes.

762
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,680
- All right, deal.
- Deal.

763
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,000
I told you, he'll have sex with anyone.

764
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,440
You better be quick, Flo.

765
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,160
I don't wanna have sex.

766
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,480
Okay. [exhales]

767
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,760
Do you want to have a seat?

768
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,200
Not having sex is a valid choice.

769
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,280
- And you shouldn't have sex unless you...
- No.

770
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,840
I don't want to have sex at all.

771
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,200
Ever, with anyone.

772
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,880
I think I might be broken.

773
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,160
Okay.

774
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,920
Why don't you start
by telling me how you feel

775
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,520
when you think about having sex?

776
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,920
I don't feel anything.

777
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,560
I have no connection to it.

778
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,720
It's sort of like...

779
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:30,520
I'm surrounded by a huge feast with
everything I could want to eat, but...

780
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,720
I'm not hungry.

781
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,720
Mmm.

782
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,560
Do you know what asexuality is?

783
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,880
It's when someone
has no sexual attraction

784
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,720
to any sex or gender.

785
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,000
Sex just...

786
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,480
doesn't do it for some people.

787
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,880
Oh. But I still want to fall in love.

788
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,400
Well, some asexual people
still want romantic relationships

789
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,200
but they don't want the sex bit.

790
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,240
And others don't want either.

791
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,680
You know, sexuality is fluid.

792
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,840
Sex doesn't make us whole.

793
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,480
And so,

794
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,960
how could you ever be broken?

795
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,040
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

796
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,120
She is so much better than sex kid.

797
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,040
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Amazing.

798
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,560
Yeah, your advice was a bit crap
but your mum is my hero,

799
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,240
so I need a refund.

800
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,360
[Otis] Uh...

801
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,280
[exhales]

802
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,040
- Hey.
- Hi.

803
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,400
[clears throat] Um...

804
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,680
I'm really sorry about last night.
That was...

805
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,080
Look, I've decided that I don't want you
to see Maeve anymore.

806
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,240
If you want to be my boyfriend,

807
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
then you have to talk to her and tell her
that you can't be friends with her.

808
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,280
[bell ringing]

809
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,760
Um... Wait.

810
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,040
Hey.

811
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,680
Hey.

812
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,680
[laughs]

813
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,880
Um, I've got, um, music.

814
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:20,560
I've been missing you.

815
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,800
- But I only saw you yesterday.
- Yeah.

816
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,760
But it felt so long.

817
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,160
[laughing]

818
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeah, and I missed you too.

819
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,840
I was...

820
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,960
thinking that maybe
you want to be my boyfriend.

821
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,320
Um...

822
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,040
Uh...

823
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,400
No pressure, okay?

824
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,200
