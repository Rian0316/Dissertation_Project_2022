1
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,000
Kids, in life there are a lot of big romantic moments.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,600
And they make life worth living.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,880
But here's the problem:

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,320
moments pass,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,360
and lurking just around the corner from those moments

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,040
is a cruel, unshaven bastard named reality.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,680
And so, back in 2006,

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,080
on the night of Claudia and Stuart's wedding,

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
reality was the enemy.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Wow. The Peace Corps?

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,560
Yeah. I ship out tomorrow-- two years.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,560
You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
To those people, I say, "Is it?"

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,400
And usually they say, "Yes, it is."

15
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,760
Barney, they are so right.

16
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,680
I wish there was something I could do.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,160
Oh, Tanya...

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,080
I'm so glad you said that.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,040
This wasn't how I'd thought the night would turn out.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,640
This was finally supposed to be my big moment with Robin.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,600
But then reality came along.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,840
Robin got called up last-minute to anchor the 11:00 news.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,320
It was her big break.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,840
And I went to the wedding stag.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,600
Then, when I least expected it...

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640
Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,720
I had the most amazing night ever.

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
Tell me about it. That cake. Best cake I ever had.

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,360
Seriously. My stomach was, like,

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,920
"Hey, bro, I don't know what you're eating, 'cause I don't have any eyes,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,800
but it's basically awesome, so keep sending it down Gullet Alley."

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,920
Yeah, I know.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
My stomach was, like, "Girlfriend, we don't always get along, but that cake..."

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Lily.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,920
Oh, right. "Most amazing night ever," and go.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,120
You know, I should tell you, I have a rule.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,320
I never hook up at weddings.

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,880
I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,400
Well, here's the thing, those big romantic moments,

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,240
they're great when they happen, but they're not real.

41
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,080
Exactly, exactly-- like-like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there,

42
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,600
I'm not gonna lie to you, big-time thunderbolt.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,560
Mm. You should see me tap dance.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,240
You'd be down on bended knee.

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,360
Sadly not out of character.

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,000
But I know now it's just a mirage.

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,480
Wedding goggles.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,200
Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
This isn't the moves?

50
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,320
What, you... you think this is the moves?

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
Believe me, you'd know the moves.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,640
People ten tables away would know the moves.

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,280
Oh, that's too bad.

54
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Tell me about it.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,200
You know, I think... I have a solution.

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Interested.

57
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,200
And to preface this, we're not gonna sleep together tonight.

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,480
Less interested.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,040
Go ahead.

60
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,920
Okay.

61
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,480
So the thing that always screws it up is the next day.

62
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Right? So...

63
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,120
Why don't we just cut that part out?

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,960
What are you saying?

65
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,080
I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, this is a big romantic wedding--

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,640
why don't we just dance and have a great time,

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,640
and then when it's over, never see each other again.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,080
- Unless...
- No. No unless.

69
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,880
No e-mails, no phone numbers, not even names.

70
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:25,280
Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished.

71
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,280
And then... when we're old and gray,

72
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
we'll look back on this night

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,000
and it'll be perfect.

74
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,520
Wow.

75
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,280
- Okay, I'm in.
- Okay.

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,320
I guess, uh, what, we'll need fake names?

77
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,480
Um... you can call me Buttercup.

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

79
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm... Lando Calrissian.

80
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,880
Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
Ted, Ted, Ted. Look, I got a bridesmaid.

82
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,960
Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid.

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,240
Ted, look. See ya, Ted.

84
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,160
So, I'm Ted.

85
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
Victoria.

86
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,560
- But no last names.
- No last names.

87
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, what is wrong with you?

88
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,080
Dude, that is just, like... a weenie-ass idea.

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,360
No, it was awesome-- I had a great night,

90
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.

91
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
Ted, how do I explain this to you?

92
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,160
Last night I ate the best cake of my life.

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,960
Now,  you think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life?

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,760
Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake,

95
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,600
and then I'm gonna get some more cake.

96
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,960
That cake really got to you, huh?

97
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,360
It haunts me.

98
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
So, what happened next?

99
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,560
Okay.

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,080
Ground rules have been established.

101
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,280
Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.

102
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

103
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,120
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,160
Yes, but we'll need... a diversion.

105
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,080
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

106
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

107
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

108
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,000
So that's what happened to the bouquet.

109
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,040
You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.

110
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,880
You're not gonna do it at your wedding?

111
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,080
Hell, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower-grenade and chuck it into the crowd

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,480
and scream, "Crawl for it, bitches!"

113
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
That's just what girls do.

114
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
So, where'd you guys go?

115
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
Very nice.

116
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,960
Yeah?

117
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Okay,  I don't really know how to tap dance.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,320
I couldn't tell. Really.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.

120
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,160
Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,280
No, you couldn't.

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
You're a dude.

123
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
- I could get some.
- You could totally get some.

124
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,360
We're not gonna kiss tonight.

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,200
If-if we kiss, all of this becomes real.

126
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,680
You-you might use too much tongue.

127
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,160
I might not use enough. And then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.

128
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,600
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.

129
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,840
Okay, how about this?

130
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,360
The best part of any first kiss is the lead-up to it.

131
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:34,760
The moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll.

132
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,600
So... how about tonight, we just stick with the drumroll?

133
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,120
Okay.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,320
But we can't kiss.

135
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,680
Okay.

136
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,560
A drumroll?

137
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,720
That's it?

138
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,600
So, what, you just... you said good night, came home and...

139
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,720
performed a drum solo?

140
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,960
Oh, Ted, you're such a doof!

141
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,800
I mean, this girl sounds amazing.

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,600
She was completely amazing.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,720
She was amazing and funny, and we connected on every level,

144
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,520
and I'm never gonna see her again.

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,840
Damn it, I have to see her again!

146
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

147
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,200
So let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?

148
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,760
Nothing. Her name's Victoria-- that's all I got.

149
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,520
Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,960
Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon.

151
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,840
She'll be back in two weeks-- call her then.

152
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,840
Yes, two weeks. Good idea.

153
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,840
I'm calling her now.

154
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,400
No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,800
Yeah, come on, dude.

156
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,000
Ask her about the cake.

157
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,880
Ted?

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,720
Hey, Claudia! Great wedding, beautiful toast, touching stuff.

159
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,680
How's the honeymoon? Listen, I'm calling because last night I met this girl,

160
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
and I was wondering if you had...

161
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,600
Oh, you have got to be freaking kidding me!

162
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,920
Aw, here we go.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,520
24 hours ago, you were begging... begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding,

164
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,520
and now, well, uh, you're over her?

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,080
I've moved on?

166
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,960
What was her name?

167
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
Is it my fat cousin Lindsay?

168
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,640
Don't be embarrassed-- she has pretty eyes.

169
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,800
Uh, no. Her name was Victoria. I don't know her last name.

170
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.

171
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,040
Thank God.

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,120
Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.

173
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
There was no Victoria at the wedding.

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,040
Maybe she used a second fake name.

175
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,360
Oh, she's good, she's very good.

176
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,720
Maybe she was ghost.

177
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,960
That's why she didn't want to kiss you--

178
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,560
because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second.

179
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,920
Oh, my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.

180
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Marshall... she was not a ghost!

181
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800
I know that she wasn't a ghost.

182
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,440
She picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,920
Wait-wait! She was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,040
She must've been at their table. Maybe they know who she was.

185
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,520
Great. So how do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?

186
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,040
This better be good-- I am about to enter Nirvana.

187
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,720
By the way, I should get you Nirvana's phone number. She gives a great massage.

188
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,720
Say what?!

189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,200
- Barney!
- Ow!

190
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,680
I know the house rules. Es un chiste!

191
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,160
Listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night.

192
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
Did you happen to get her phone number?

193
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
You know I did.

194
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,600
Great! Um, I'm gonna need you to call her for me.

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,320
You know I won't.

196
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,840
Why not?

197
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,800
Because we just hooked up last night.

198
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,760
I can't call the girl the next day.

199
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,480
I have to wait at least, like... forever.

200
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,520
Oh,  snap! Never gonna call her.

201
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,080
Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.

202
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh, come on, Barney, it's for a good cause.

203
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,600
Uh, Ted going all castrati over yet another girl is exactly not a good cause.

204
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,680
Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you-- my hands are tied.

205
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh, no, wait-- that was last night.

206
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,760
Okay, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

207
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,760
You make this call and I will go with you...

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,240
to Foxy Boxing.

209
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,080
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,800
But you always said the Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy not good at boxing.

211
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm ready to be proven wrong.

212
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,280
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

213
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,360
Dial.

214
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,920
Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps till tomorrow.

215
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,440
Yeah, I know. It sucks.

216
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Just one fewer day I get to help people.

217
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,160
Anyway, this girl-- any idea who she was?

218
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,920
Hold on.

219
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,720
What kind of shoes was sh... No, Tanya, he's a dude.

220
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,880
He's not going to know what kind of shoes she was wearing.

221
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,920
Actually...

222
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,480
Oh, come on.

223
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,000
Hey!

224
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,680
So what do you want to do next?

225
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,720
Don't think. First thing that comes into your mind.

226
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,960
Hold... this...

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,480
and this...

228
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,040
Whoa!

229
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,920
There she goes.

230
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,000
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes...

231
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,760
...with little snowflakes on them.

232
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,040
Yeah, they do sound cute.

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,160
Any idea who...?

234
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,840
Okay. Well, thanks anyway.

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,960
Yeah, you take ca...

236
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:15,840
What's...?

237
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,320
Tonight?

238
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Well, I'm shipping out pretty early, so I won't be able to stay over,

239
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
but, yeah, sure, I'd love to.

240
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,600
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

241
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,200
Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make Foxy Boxing tonight.

242
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,200
I understand.

243
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,640
Okay, uh, let's not lose hope.

244
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,360
We'll  call the hotel. Maybe she was staying there.

245
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,320
We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria.

246
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,280
Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...

247
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Or Ictor.

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,960
She probably doesn't go by "Ictor."

249
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,120
No, you know what?

250
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,360
This is fate.

251
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,920
I am never supposed to see this girl again.

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,120
That was the whole point of the night.

253
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,280
I have just been saved from myself.

254
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,400
Let's drink many beers.

255
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,280
Agreed.

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,280
And I thought that was the end of it.

257
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
But then...

258
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,560
Hey! There's the anchor lady!

259
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,440
How was it?

260
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,880
Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor?

261
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,760
Robin? Thanks, Robin! It was awesome. Back to you, Robin.

262
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
Congrats! That's so cool!

263
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,520
Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted, though.

264
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...

265
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,000
And then Lily told her the whole story,

266
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,320
right down to the brown shoes with the little snowflakes on them.

267
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,720
And by the end of it...

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,760
What?

269
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,080
I know who she is.

270
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,880
You know who she is? But you weren't even at the wedding.

271
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,360
Actually, I kind of... was.

272
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,360
What?

273
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,040
Well, after the newscast, I was so excited

274
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,960
I decided to surprise Ted  by going to the reception.

275
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,720
Oh, damn it!

276
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,440
Oh, stop it!

277
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,840
What the hell!

278
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,800
Hello?

279
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,400
You okay in there?

280
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,640
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...

281
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,520
Just allergies or something.

282
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm fine.

283
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,880
Listen, do you... want to come and cry out here?

284
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.

285
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,320
Oh, thanks.

286
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,480
But I don't actually cry in front of people or...

287
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
cry at all, for that matter.

288
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,640
Oh, man, it's gross.

289
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,120
Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?

290
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,240
Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter.

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
So, why are you crying?

292
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,400
Because you have feelings for Ted.

293
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
I don't know.

294
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,160
Maybe?

295
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,920
Okay, what is wrong with the two of you! Seriously!

296
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,840
He likes you and you like him. And j-j-just be together!

297
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,480
Cheese Louise! Happiness is not that difficult!

298
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,320
Look, okay, yes. I cried in the bathroom and that... was weird.

299
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,720
But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy.

300
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,440
The fact is, I-I don't know how I feel.

301
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,960
Yes, you do!

302
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,520
Seeing him with someone else and crying about it?

303
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
Guess what? That's how you feel.

304
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,880
That is nothing but how you feel.

305
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,800
Okay, fine. I have feelings for him.

306
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,680
Happy?

307
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,160
Kinda, yeah.

308
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,040
But it doesn't change anything.

309
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,400
I still don't want to get married and he's still... Ted.

310
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,760
What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he can be happy.

311
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,720
Or you could tell him that you're into him and then you could both be happy.

312
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,800
I'm going to go find him.

313
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,200
Well, wait.

314
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,920
Which one are you going to tell him?

315
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
I have no idea.

316
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,960
And here's the most amazing part--

317
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,240
Because I told her I'd converted all my money to India dollars,

318
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,200
she gave me 50 bucks to take a cab to the airport.

319
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,680
That's right. I just got paid for sex.

320
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,680
I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.

321
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,120
Hi, guys.

322
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,160
Hey.

323
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,960
Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?

324
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,760
Yeah, sure.

325
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,680
What's up?

326
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Um... I, uh, I have to tell you something.

327
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,320
Oh...

328
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, just get it.

329
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,400
Hello?

330
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,240
Ted? It's Stuart.

331
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,720
My lovely bride would like to say something to you.

332
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,880
Ted... I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier.

333
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,040
My new husband, and the vodka cranberry,

334
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,760
which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar...

335
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,920
When is this plane going to board?!

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:42,800
Sweet pea?

337
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,760
...have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person,

338
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,680
and I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.

339
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,080
It's fine, Claudia, don't worry about it.

340
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,640
Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.

341
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,640
The cake?

342
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,800
Why don't you take this?

343
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
Sounds like you could use it.

344
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,400
Thanks.

345
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,040
You're very sweet.

346
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,800
So are you a friend of the bride or groom?

347
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,840
We got it at this little bakery downtown.

348
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,240
Actually neither.

349
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,160
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.

350
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,880
Pleased to meet you, Buttercup.

351
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,360
I made the cake.

352
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,200
She made the cake.

353
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,800
She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest.

354
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
She made the cake.

355
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,320
She made that cake? Ted, this is the girl.

356
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,080
You  got to marry her. Today.

357
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,480
She has to move in with us.

358
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,960
I'm going down to that bakery.

359
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,240
No, no. Don't do it.

360
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,040
Baby, what are you talking about?!

361
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Yeah, all day long you been busting my apple-bag about finding this girl.

362
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,720
Well, I-I just think that... that maybe she's not that into you.

363
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,000
And-and that's why she didn't give you her number.

364
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,720
Robin?

365
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,400
Care to chime in with anything?

366
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,800
Yes.

367
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,760
Ted...

368
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,040
Go get her.

369
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,160
Going. Getting.

370
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,040
Ted, oh, my, gosh, I love this moment. You know why?

371
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,920
'Cause I'm going to say it, and this time, you're actually going to say yes.

372
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You ready? You ready to say yes?

373
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,560
Ted, suit up.

374
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,440
Yes!

375
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,440
No.

376
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,680
Oh, come on!

377
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.

378
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Oh, that's too bad.

379
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,840
I was looking forward to one last dance.

380
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,760
Well, yes, I am.

381
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,200
Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.

382
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,840
Wow, what was I just thinking?

383
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,080
"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux."

384
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,200
- You got me. You are good.
- Yeah. Mmm.

385
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,400
You know, I don't look like this every day.

386
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,320
On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.

387
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,000
Mmm. The real Ted sounds real sexy.

388
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,400
Too bad I'll never get to see it.

389
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.

390
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,400
Good luck, dude.

391
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,840
Grab me a cupcake.

392
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Ted? You still with us?

393
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,480
Tell me your last name.

394
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,600
You know there's one little flaw in our plan.

395
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,600
What's that?

396
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
I'm going to go home tonight with a lot of great memories

397
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,600
and one really sucky memory.

398
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
The memory of you walking out that door.

399
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,560
Hey, Ted.

400
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,920
Yeah?

401
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,680
Close your eyes...

402
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,160
and count to five.

403
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,640
One...

404
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,360
two...

405
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
three...

406
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,960
four...

407
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,240
five.

408
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,240
And to our dying days we'll remember everything about that night as perfect.

409
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,680
Maybe we both need that.

410
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,240
I mean, so many things go wrong in life

411
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,240
but this is the one thing that never will.

412
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,000
It will always...

413
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,400
always be pure unadulterated awesome.

414
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,960
And if I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us...

415
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,760
The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.

416
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,840
Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

417
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
Oh, thank God.
