4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,220
任人唯亲

5
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:49,501
伯纳 大臣几点上电台录节目?
What time is the Ministerrecording this broadcast?

6
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,200
下午2点 汉弗莱爵士
Two p.m., Sir Humphrey.

7
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:54,093
你真的不能阻止他提及索里赫尔工程吗?
Can't you stop him referringto the Solihull project?

8
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,172
根本不可能      噢 天
There's not a hope.Oh, God.

9
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:58,980
他将把它描述成政府和私营企业
"It's a shining exampleof collaboration

10
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,291
成功合作的光辉典范
between governmentand industry".

11
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,419
他怎么能这么认为?   您告诉他的 汉弗莱爵士
How could he think that?You told him itwas.

12
00:01:06,101 --> 00:01:07,853
一个耗资7千4百万 占地9英亩
Can a 74 millionbuilding project

13
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,093
地处市中心的工程 怎么捂的住?
in the middle of a city,be swept underthe carpet?

14
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,951
通过《官方保密法》
We'll use the Official SecretsA secret? .

15
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,180
这么大的工程 怎能保密?
It's so huge

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,375
这是个大秘密 伯纳
It's a big secret, Bernard.

17
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,974
但您怎能用《官方保密法》
But you can't usethe Official Secrets Act

18
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,210
保护众所周知的事情?
with somethingeverybody knows about?

19
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,000
伯纳 《官方保密法》不是保护秘密的
The Official Secrets Act is notto protect secrets, 

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,369
是保护官方的
but officials.

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,170
汉弗莱爵士 为什么您至今还不允许我
Why haven't you allowed meto show

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,015
把索里赫尔工程报告给大臣看 告诉他真相
the Solihull Report to theMinister, tell him the truth?

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,813
他还没问到
He hasn't asked.

24
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,972
既然他不想知道 为什么还要劳烦他?
Why bothera Ministerifhe doesn'twant to know?

25
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,495
但是如果他一无所知 又怎能问到呢?
But how could he askifhe doesn't know?

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,093
正是
Quite so.

27
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,457
汉弗莱爵士 不是我怀疑您的判断力 但是...
It's not that I'm questioningyourjudgement but...

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,338
但是什么?     为什么要这样做?
But?           But why?

29
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,732
伯纳 因为在索里赫尔工程报告里
Because, Bernard,the Solihull Report contained

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,336
有一段话质疑麦克・布莱利先生
a paragraph casting doubton the financial soundness

31
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,697
和斯洛安公司的财务稳健性
of Michael Bradleyand Sloane Enterprises Ltd.

32
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,884
其后看来的确具有洞察力
And the report's foresight had someinsight

33
00:02:01,884 --> 00:02:03,614
和先见之明
in the light ofhindsight?

34
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,969
什么?
What?

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,939
它预见到布莱利的公司要破产?
If it said that Michael Bradleywas going to go bust?

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,091
拜托 伯纳 小心说话
Please, Bernard,watch your language.

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,414
关键是报告出来时 我...
The point is that, by the timethe Report came out, I was so...

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,811
或是说部里对布莱利坚信不移
orratherthe Departmentwas so committed to Bradley

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,609
愿意冒险将工程做完
that it seemed worth takingthe risk to see the project through.

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,772
如果大臣知道政府的合资伙伴濒临破产
If the Ministerknowsthis partnerwas going bust,

41
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,500
他就不会糊涂到在广播上宣扬 对吧?
he wouldn't makea broadcast about it.

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,898
伯纳 大臣们不必知道的东西还是不知道的好
Ministers should neverknowmore than they need to know.

43
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,619
这样他们就不可能告诉别人
Then they can't tell anyone.

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,938
像特工一样
Like secret agents.

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,892
他们可能会被俘获和逼供
They could be capturedand tortured.

46
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,413
您是指被恐怖分子?
By terrorists?

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,491
被BBC 伯纳
By the BBC, Bernard.

48
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,935
银行可能会扣下抵押品 这是个隐患
The bank doesn't knowwhetherornot to foreclose.

49
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,276
总之 我今天将和银行主席 
I'll dine with Sir 

50
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:50,376
戴斯蒙・格雷布克爵士吃饭
Desmond Glazebrook, theirChairman.

51
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,332
我们会一起做出点东西来
We might manageto cook something up.

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,172
为什么不直接下馆子?
Why don't you goto a restaurant?

53
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,369
总之 在这个时候不管怎样
Anyway, in the meantime,come what may,

54
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,374
必须阻止大臣在广播上提索里赫尔工程
the Ministermust not referto the Solihull Project on the air.

55
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,976
汉弗莱爵士 这有点像是在掩盖是吗?
Sir Humphrey,this is a bit of a coverup, isn't it?

56
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,289
当然不是 伯纳
Certainly not.

57
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,055
这是基于国家利益的负责手段
It is responsible discretionexercised in the national interest

58
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,972
意在阻止正当程序
to prevent unnecessary disclosure

59
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,372
不必要的泄露
of eminently justifiable procedures

60
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,038
以免不合时宜的公开
in which untimely revelation couldseverely 

61
00:03:18,038 --> 00:03:19,738
严重挫伤公众信心
impairpublic confidence.

62
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,731
我明白了 就像水门事件?
Oh, I see.It's like Watergate?

63
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
伯纳
Bernard!

64
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,210
如果你想辞职去BBC当主持人
If you wish to leave the Serviceand become a BBC interviewer,

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,099
打个报告就行    抱歉 汉弗莱爵士
you have only to apply.I'm sorry, but...

66
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,216
可这和水门事件到底有什么差别?
Howwas Watergatedifferent exactly?

67
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,053
水门事件发生在美国 伯纳
Watergate happenedin America, Bernard!

68
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,657
噢 是的 我明白了
Oh yes, yes. I see.

69
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,170
早上好 大臣      早上好 汉弗莱
Good morning, Minister.Good morning.

70
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,137
早上好 伯纳 抱歉我迟到了
Morning, Bernard.Sorry I'm late.

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,177
放到桌子上就行 乔治
Put them on the desk, George.

72
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,616
还有一小时 广播可不能迟到      没错 先生
I don'twant to be lateat Broadcasting House.

73
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,897
这个广播关于什么的? 北约 对吧?
What's the broadcast all about?NATO, wasn't it?

74
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,971
不 大臣 工业合作      对了
No, partherships in industry.

75
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,293
我就知道差不多
Oh, yes. I knewitwas something like that.

76
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,970
还有谁在?     都写在这儿了 大臣
Who else is in it?        It's all in there.

77
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,335
照例是一个雇主和一个工会会员
An Employerand a Trades Unionist.

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,179
乔・摩根?
Joe Morgan?

79
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,252
索里赫尔工程的工会联合代表?
Wasn't he the TUC representativeon the Solihull project?

80
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,569
大臣...
Er, Minister...

81
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,769
什么事 汉弗莱?
Yes, Humphrey?

82
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,569
大臣 您不会在广播上提索里赫尔工程吧?
You are not proposing to referto the Solihull project on the air?

83
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,208
当然会 这是政府和私有企业
Yes. It's a shining exampleof cooperation

84
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,336
成功合作的光辉典范
between the Governmentand industry.

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,298
是的 尽管如此 我更乐意您忽略它
But I would be much happierif itwere omitted.

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,460
为什么?
Why?

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,180
您不认为为时过早吗?
Don't you thinkit's ratherpremature?

88
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,900
怎么会 几个月前就动工了
Certainly not.Building started months ago.

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,178
确切地说 实际上是过时了
Exactly.Ratherout of date, in fact.

90
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,251
既过早又过时?
Premature and out of date?

91
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,251
恩 是不合时宜
Well, untimely.

92
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,173
您难道不认为公众会不感兴趣吗?
Would it be uninterestingto the general public?

93
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,331
会感兴趣 这是眼下进行的事
No. It's somethingthat's going on.

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,536
非常有趣      对啊
Extremely interesting.Yes. Quite so.

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,691
太有趣了 其实风险在于
So interestingthat there is a danger

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,738
可能会淡化您的主要观点
that it might obscureyourmain point, perhaps.

97
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,578
我的主要观点是什么?
What is my main point?

98
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,574
伯纳 大臣的主要观点是什么?
Bernard, what's the Minister'smain point?

99
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,500
哦 政府投资让私营工程
Private projects are more  

100
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,295
更富于社会责任
sociallyresponsible with government money,

101
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,157
私人投资让政府工程
and government projects are more efficient

102
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,657
更有效率
with private investment.

103
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,095
看到没有? 它强调了我的主要观点
You see?It underlines my main point.

104
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,057
你真让人扫兴 对吧汉弗莱
You really are a wet blanket.

105
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,211
总是泼人冷水
Just go about stirring up apathy.

106
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,928
大臣 我必须郑重建议
Minister, I must seriouslyadvise you

107
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,455
并诚挚请求您
with all the earnestnessat my command,

108
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,612
今天不要在广播上提及索里赫尔工程
not to referto the Solihull Projecton the air.

109
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,849
为什么?
Why?

110
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,097
什么?      我说为什么?
What?I said, why?

111
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,569
为什么?     为什么?
Why?Why?

112
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
这个 大臣...
Well, Minister...

113
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,332
你不会是想把功劳归为己有吧?
Are you planning to takethe credit forthis yourself?

114
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,811
在下个月的欧洲政府行政会议上
At the European Conventionof Government administration.

115
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,858
什么?     你的主要讲话将很受重视
Yourspeech will makevery good reading.

116
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,897
但是 让我教你些常识 汉弗莱
Well, a fewfacts of life.

117
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,930
对人民负最终责任的是政治家
Politicians are responsibleultimately to the people,

118
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,217
功劳也归政治家 不归公务员
and we get the credit.Not Civil Servants.

119
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,419
大臣 我很愿意把"功劳"让给您
I would be happyforyou to havethe "credit" forthis project.

120
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,652
但是我必须再三恳求您不要选择今天
But, I must beg, beseechand implore you not today.

121
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,937
不 没用的汉弗莱 我不会上当的 
No, it's no good.I'm not going to fall for it.

122
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,898
我要从索里赫尔工程中捞取一切政治资本
I'm going to getall the political capital of this.

123
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,016
好东西我是不会看走眼的
I know a good thingwhen I see one.

124
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,136
请您听我说...   不 不 不
Please, do listen to...No. No. No.

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,699
大臣...   不行
Minister, p...No,

126
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,734
小汉
Humpy.

127
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,973
什么?   什么?
What?What?

128
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,177
要是我 我早脱身了
If it had been up to me,I'd help out like a shot.

129
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,655
没错 戴斯蒙
Quite so.

130
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,288
大臣看走眼 找骗子合伙
It's not the bank's faultif some idiot Minister

131
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,293
骗子卷款逃跑 这不是银行的责任
gets into bed with a kid,who runs with the money.

132
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,928
也不能全怪当时那个大臣
That Ministerwasn'tentirely to blame.

133
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,409
也有情有可原的地方
There were extenuatingcircumstances.

134
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,890
当初这个布莱利看起来很可靠
This Bradley chap lookedvery sound at the time.

135
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,575
没错 但换了你就不会上当吧
But you wouldn't have donea damn fool thing like that.

136
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,528
对吧?
Would you?

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,250
我是说 如果他当初只是周转不灵
When it looked like Bradleywanted a loan thatwas one thing.

138
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,217
现在只是他个人埋不了单而已
But nowhe can't pay his bills.

139
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,733
应该说 他似乎不能
Well, he is unlikely

140
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,415
兑现他对女王陛下作出的财政上的承诺
to fulfil financial undertakingsto Her Majesty's Government.

141
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,298
还是说他埋不了单嘛
Can't pay his bills, you mean.

142
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,012
要是船沉了 他很可能把政府的财政机构也拉下水
And Her Majesty's Government'sundertakings godown with him.

143
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,180
是的
Yes.

144
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,015
除非有一个信誉好的银行
Unless a reputable bank wereto take overthe contract

145
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,934
以参与工程为名接手布莱利的合约
from Bradley with a viewto participating in a project

146
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,000
表明政府有决心
which Her Majesty's Government is 

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,888
让工程成功获利
determined to make profitable.

148
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,060
没错

我个人很关注索里赫尔工程 因为...

工会 政府和业界彼此平等

00:14:50,899 --> 00:14:53,099
跟工会谈判
negotiations in a BBC studio.

296
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,213
而且 这归就业部门管
And that's a matterforthe Employment...

297
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,575
我知道 可你一句话...     不 对不起
But a word from you...No, I'm sorry.

298
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,415
开了先例 就会有曼彻斯特津贴 普利茅斯津贴
We'd have a Manchesterallowance,Plymouth allowance,

299
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,332
萨德伯利津贴
Chipping Sodbury allowance...

300
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,937
这次广播之后 人们可能问及索里赫尔工程
Afterthis broadcast people mightask about the Solihull project,

301
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,091
想多了解一下
wanting to knowmore about it.

302
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,409
希望如此
I hope they do.

303
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,210
但据我所知 有些东西不该让人了解
But as we know, there aresome things betternot found out.

304
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,010
大家心照不宣就好
I'm sure we understandone another.

305
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,729
是吗?
Do we?

306
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,218
眼里进东西啦?
Something in youreye?

307
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,415
是希望之光啊     什么?
Just a gleam.           What?

308
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,497
哦 少来了 哈克
Oh, come off it, Hacker.

309
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,333
我们已经抓住你的小辫子了
We've got youby the short and curlies.

310
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,654
我开价低于伦敦10%的津贴
And I'm asking10 % below London allowance,

311
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,539
你杀到30%
and we'll settle for 30 % below.

312
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,850
对外宣传你大获全胜
Give you the creditforbeating us down.

313
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,330
抱歉 我不发伯明翰津贴 别抱希望了
No allowance. You'd betterresign youself to that.

314
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,772
没希望的可不是我
I'm not the onewho will have to resign.

315
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,893
你在说什么?     当然是索里赫尔工程
What are you talking about?The Solihull Project.

316
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,052
我都不敢相信你在广播上把它往自己身上揽
I could hardly believeyou took all the credit for it.

317
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,690
勇气可嘉 但你中了什么邪?
Great courage, of course,but whateverpossessed you?

318
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,057
"枪林弹雨 左右夹攻" ("轻骑兵进击" 丁尼生 1855)
"Cannons to the right ofhim,Cannons to the left ofhim,

319
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,939
"哈克先生视死如归"
Into the Valley of deathrode Mr. Hacker".

320
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,893
怎么样 先生?
How did it go, sir?

321
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,255
哦 很好 很好
Oh, very well. Very well.

322
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,852
我讲了政府和企业界的合作
I was talking about governmentindustry cooperation.

323
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,572
中部地区有一个很有趣的工程
There's a very interesting projectin the Midlands.

324
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,938
我想你没听过 但是很有意思
I don't suppose you'd have heardabout it, but it's very interesting

325
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,737
如果你知道内情的话
if you know the background.

326
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,249
你不是指索里赫尔工程吧 先生?
You don't meanthe Solihull Project, sir?

327
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,496
是的 你听过?
Yes. You have heard about it.

328
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,609
你笑什么?   没什么 先生
What are you laughing about?Nothing, sir.

329
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,449
你听到什么?   真的没什么 先生
What have you heard?Nothing really, sir.

330
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,256
我们把它看作是政府和私人企业
It's a shining exampleof collaboration

331
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,376
成功合作的光辉典范
between governmentand industry.

332
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,895
有什么好笑的? 你都知道些什么?
What do you know about all this?

333
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,372
行政部和布莱利先生办公室间的37趟车程
37 journeys between the Ministryand Mr. Michael Bradley's office,

334
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,930
从法灵顿街44号到索里赫尔伯明翰路129号
44 Farringdon Street, and129 Birmingham Road, Solihull.

335
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,898
37趟车程? 和谁?
37 journeys? Who with?

336
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,336
前任大臣 先生 多数还有汉弗莱爵士
Yourpredecessor, sir,and Sir Humphrey, mostly.

337
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,659
开始几趟他们兴致很高
Very cheerful they were,on the first few trips.

338
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,653
不断说着合作啦
They kept talking aboutshining examples

339
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,459
光辉典范之类
of successful collaborationand such like.

340
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,574
接下来就开始愁云惨淡了 您明白吧?
Then the gloom startedto come down.

341
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,258
愁云惨淡?   嗯 不是愁云惨淡
Gloom?          Well, no not gloom.

342
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,896
更象是绝望 真的
More like desperation, really.

343
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,171
绝望? 为什么?
Desperation?What about?

344
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,255
您不是了解内情嘛 先生
You know the background, sir.

345
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,772
是 是的 没错
Well, yes, yes...

346
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,738
具体哪部分内情?
Any bit of the backgroundyou were thinking of?

347
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,000
没有 我是说有的事有些蹊跷时 
No. When something's fishy,

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,939
它只是蹊跷而已 不是吗?
it's just fishy, isn't it?

349
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,019
你也不知道具体哪里不对头
You don't knowwhich bitthe smell's coming from.

350
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,452
蹊跷?     恩 我其实也不清楚
Fishy?         Well, I don't really know.

351
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,932
我只知道布莱利先生可能人品不错
Forall I know,Mr. Bradley may be quite kosher,

352
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,217
尽管汉弗莱爵士不同意
despite everythingSir Humphrey said about him.

353
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,049
这些您比我更了解 先生
You knowmore about all thatthan I do.

354
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,494
我不过是个司机
I'm just the driver.

355
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,733
对 对
Quite. Quite.

356
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,131
我不过是个大臣
I'm just the Minister.

357
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,455
是 我同意伯明翰津贴决不能发
An allowance for Morgan's unionis out of the question.

358
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,736
广播怎么样 大臣?
But howwas the broadcast?

359
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,056
我认为还可以吧
Well, all right, I think.

360
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,494
您认为?
You think?

361
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,773
我为索里赫尔工程大唱赞歌
I talkedabout the Solihull Project.

362
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,454
现在又不放心
And then I had second thoughts.

363
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,338
有什么特别的原因吗?
Any particularreason?

364
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,416
不 汉弗莱 索里赫尔工程还顺利吗?
No... Humphrey, is everything allright about the Solihull Project?

365
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,889
是的 大臣
Yes, Minister.

366
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,415
我知道施工进展令人满意
The building worksproceed satisfactorily.

367
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,094
不 不 不 我不是指这个
No, no, no,that's not what I meant.

368
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,618
眼下有什么情况吗?     眼下在施工啊 大臣
Is something going on?          Building is going on.

369
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,054
不 不 汉弗莱
No, no, Humphrey.

370
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,097
出了些事情对吧?
Something's up, isn't it?

371
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,411
对 确实是 大臣     什么?
Yes indeed, Minister.         What?

372
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,014
第一层楼出来了 第二层差不多了
The 1st floor is up,and the 2nd flooralmost up.

373
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,172
不 汉弗莱 我指的是工程的基础
I'm talking about the whole basisof the thing.

374
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,932
哦 我明白了
Oh, I see.

375
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,536
基础你知道什么?     据我所知
What can you tell me about?As I understand it...

376
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,134
地基是6英尺顶极碎石
The basis is an aggregateof gravel and cement on

377
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,291
覆盖沙砾和混凝土
six feet ofbest builders rubble.

378
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,213
汉弗莱 你知道我是说财务方面
You know I am talkingabout the finance.

379
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,168
哦 您问我们和建筑公司签的合同?   是吗?
Ourcontractwith the constructioncompany you mean?

380
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,298
是 我知道工程款还在分期支付
The stage payments arein accordance with all the usual...

381
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,815
汉弗莱 我到底不知道什么?
Humphrey!What is it that I don't know?

382
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,534
您具体指什么 大臣?   我不知道
What precisely do you mean?I don't know.

383
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,256
问题就在于我不知道
That's just it, I don't know

384
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,571
我不知道 因为我不知道该问你什么
because I can't findwhat questions to ask you,

385
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,698
我不知道该问你什么 因为我不知道
and I don't knowwhat to ask youbecause I don't know.

386
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,578
到底什么我不知道?
What is it that I don't know?

387
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,812
大臣 我不知道你不知道什么
Minister, I don't knowwhat you don't know.

388
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,052
可能是任何事
It could be almost anything.

389
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,212
你有事瞒着我 对吧?   是的
Your're keeping something from me.Yes indeed.

390
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:45,617
本部门有责任保护大臣
It is the Department's dutyto protect the Minister

391
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,499
免受日复一日冲击部门的
from the great tideof irrelevant information

392
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,891
大量无关信息干扰
that beats against the wallsof this Department.

393
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,096
汉弗莱 关于索里赫尔工程的事
There is somethingabout the Solihull Project

394
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,535
我知道我不知道 我知道你知道
that I know I don't knowand I know you know.

395
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,770
我知道伯纳知道 乔・摩根知道
I know Bernard knows.Joe Morgan knows.

396
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,851
我的司机都比我知道
My own driverknowsmore than I do.

397
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,333
只有我这个
Only poorJoe Soap 

398
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,456
面向全国的公开发言人
who hasto tell the public about it

399
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,737
还完全蒙在鼓里
hasn't got a clueas to what's going on.

400
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,290
汉弗莱 能回答我一个简单的问题吗?
Will you answera simple question?

401
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,889
当然 大臣 是什么?
Certainly, Minister.What is it?

402
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,258
我不知道
I don't know!

403
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,130
如果你告诉我 我就会问了
If you tell me, I'll ask it!

404
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
嗯...
Well...

405
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,089
什么事 弗兰克?     我们的会议
Yes, Frank?          Ourmeeting.

406
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,649
关于我的公营机构报告     哦 对 进来
About my quango paper.         Come on in.

407
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:29,096
读过弗兰克的报告吗 汉弗莱?     是的 大臣
You've read Frank's paper?Yes indeed, Minister.

408
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,289
你怎么看? 消除部门权利寻租那段
What did you think about endingthe ministerial patronage?

409
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,610
几千个职位 任人唯亲
All those thousandsof jobs forthe boys.

410
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,214
很有独创性 富于想象力
Most original and imaginative.

411
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,729
你支持?
You liked it?

412
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,256
弗兰克 这两个词是汉弗莱最严厉的批评
Those are two of Humphrey'smost damning criticisms.

413
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,929
可在政治上会大受好评的
Itwould be a very popularpolitical move.

414
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,376
公营机构任命权上交议会专责委员会
Hand the quango appointmentsoverto Parliament.

415
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,499
任命贤才 而不让那些小集团和党棍送来送去
The best men forthe job insteadof old chums, partyhacks.

416
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,491
正是 应该为此立法
It should be legislated.

417
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,458
很新奇的提议     新奇 又是一个杀手锏
It is a novel proposal...That's the otherkiller.

418
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,214
但是鉴于现行体制运作平稳...
But when a systemis working smoothly...

419
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,577
平稳? 看这个
Smoothly! Look at this!Proposal forChairman

420
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,812
"最新公营机构 工业合作委员会主席人选"
of the new IndustrialCoparthership Commission,

421
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,369
"戴斯蒙・格雷布克爵士" 我问你
Sir Desmond Glazebrook,I ask you!

422
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,451
他从未在工业界干过 也没当过工会会员
He's neverbeen in industry,

423
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,817
还和本届政府唱反调
and he's said unpleasant thingsabout this government.

424
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,210
提名这种人 能叫平稳吗?
Is that a smoothlyoperating system?

425
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,133
他将是个出色的主席   他是个满口胡言的蠢材
He would be an excellent...He's a blithering idiot!

426
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,929
是 但也是个出色的主席   我很遗憾 汉弗莱
Yes, but an excellent Chairman.I'm sorry, Humphrey.

427
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,012
我有底线的 戴斯蒙・格雷布克不行
I am not going to appointSir Desmond Glazebrook.

428
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,569
大臣 非他不可   不 不 不...
Minister, you must.No, no, no...

429
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,573
拜托 大臣   不行 格雷布克没门
Please, Minister...No way. No Glazebrook.

430
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,696
除非我死了 好了?
Overmy dead body. Right?

431
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,330
大臣 在您最终决定之前
Minister, before you makeyourfinal decision

432
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,013
我想您该看看这个
I think perhaps you oughtto see this.

433
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,331
"索里赫尔工程报告"
"Report on the Solihull Project".

434
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,058
为什么是绝密?
Why is it top secret?

435
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,898
750万英镑...
"7.5 million pounds...

436
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,096
濒临破产
probably bankrupt proceedings...

437
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,575
工程倒塌迫在眉睫...
inminent collapse of project"...well...

438
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,575
工程倒塌迫在眉睫?
Imminent collapse of project!

439
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,178
汉弗莱 怎么不早告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me?

440
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,298
大臣 我深知您日理万机
I am conscious of the heavyburdens of youroffice.

441
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,133
但这会是所有报刊的头条新闻
But this'll beall overthe front pages.

442
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,575
会变成公共丑闻 灾难 真是...
It's a public scandal,a disaster. It's...

443
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,412
骇人听闻   等等 吉姆
It's appalling...           Jim.

444
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,811
这是选举前签的 算不到你头上
It is dated before the election.You're in the clear.

445
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,972
是的 但不幸的是
Yes, but unfortunatelyunderthe convention

446
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,973
根据大臣问责制 责任将归咎于...
of Ministerial responsability,the blame must fall...

447
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,608
大家都知道不是吉姆   没错
Everyone will know itwasn't Jim.Quite so.

448
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,295
可民主责任原则要求
The principle of democraticaccountability requires

449
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,496
偶尔杀一儆百
the occasional human sacrifice.

450
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,773
当猎犬吠叫着要喝血...
When the packis baying forblood...

451
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,295
对吗 大臣?   他只要指出日期就行
Isn't that right?He'll point to the dates...

452
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,339
哦 稍软弱的人可能会推脱
Oh, a lesserman might tryto wriggle out of it.

453
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,492
可是体面的办法只有一种
But there is onlyone honourable course open.

454
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,419
大臣已经明白了
As the Minister is well aware.

455
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,931
弗兰克说的或许有理?
Frank might have a point?

456
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,938
除非您今天没有公开以
Only today you have publiclyidentified yourself

457
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,977
工程接班人自居
with the success of the project.

458
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,410
那个广播! 什么时候播?
The broadcast!When's it going out?

459
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,889
应该是现在      现在?
It's due fortransmissionabout now.

460
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,573
恐怕是      马上找BBC
Get on to the BBC at once.

461
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,731
停止 伯纳   停止什么? 哦 对
Stop it!Stop what? Oh yes...

462
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,532
大臣 我祝您好运 但您该知道BBC的禀性
I wish you luck but you knowwhat the BBC are like.

463
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,134
这是个危机 是个丑闻
This is a crisis,this is a scandal...

464
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,849
如果您都这样说了 他们会...
If you were to put it like that,they might...

465
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,012
会怎样?   放到黄金时段?
Might what?Move it to peak listening time.

466
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,895
怎么样 伯纳?
Any luck?

467
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,178
索里赫尔正有个绝好的例子
Aperfect example of what can bedone is going on up in Solihull.

468
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,537
政府投资和私人投资紧密结合
Government money and privateinvestment in real partnership

469
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,739
我想这象征了政府的工作方式
to me, symbolic of everythingthis Government is working for.

470
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,415
我个人很关注索里赫尔工程
I've taken a great personalinterest in the Solihull project.

471
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,493
不是空谈 一砖一石都在那里
It's not just words, it's actuallythere in bricks and mortar...

472
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,452
"象征着政府的工作方式"
"Symbolic of everythingthis Government is working for".

473
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,814
汉弗莱 你怎能让我兜售这些东西
How could you let me sayall those things?

474
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,936
大臣 我只能提建议
Minister, I can only advise.

475
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,568
我提了建议 最强烈的建议
I did advise.I advised most strongly.

476
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,856
但是当建议者的建议不受重视
But when the adviser's adviceis unheeded...

477
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,738
好了 好了
All right, all right.

478
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,337
现在有什么建议
Advise me now.

479
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,733
当然 大臣
Certainly, Minister.

480
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,534
银行有可能接手
It is possible that the bankmay take over

481
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,134
布莱利和斯洛安公司的合约
the contract from Bradleyand Sloane Enterprises Ltd.

482
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,779
那就没事了
And all will be well.

483
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,728
银行!好的!对...   然而银行方面在犹豫
The bank! Fine! Well...The bank, however, is hesitant.

484
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,853
但碰巧他们的董事长
But it so happens thatthe Director in charge

485
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,409
将在明年退休 他正渴望
is to retire next yearand he's anxious

486
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,457
找另外的差事
to find anotherappointment...

487
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,009
例如公营机构主席职位
a chairmanship of a quango,for instance.

488
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,374
给他一个
Give him one!

489
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,140
就给你留给那个蠢才
Give him that one you werereserving forthat idiot

490
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,256
戴斯蒙・格雷布克的职位
Sir Desmond Glazebrook.

491
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,334
谁是董事长?
Who is the Director?

492
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,649
戴斯蒙・格雷布克
Desmond Glazebrook.

493
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,937
他人不赖 真的
He's not a bad chap, really.

494
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,856
他总是公开抨击政府
He's always attackingthe government.

495
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,093
有时任命反对派也有好处
It does us good sometimesto appoint ouropponents.

496
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,251
以示民主 有政治家风范
It's democratic, statesmanlike.

497
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,934
我改主意了 这么任命很合适
Yes, that'sa very good appointment.

498
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,216
但你不能   闭嘴 弗兰克
But you can't.Do shut up, Frank!

499
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,298
还有其他人知道这件事吗?
Anybody else know about this?

500
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,009
除了我们 银行 布莱利本人
Apart from ourselvesand the bank and Michael Bradley,

501
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,136
只有那个工会代表
the Union representative.

502
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,858
乔・摩根 当然
Joe Morgan!Of course.

503
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,849
这就是他那伯明翰津贴背后的玄机
That's whatwas behind his specialBirmingham allowance claim.

504
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,296
讹诈   没错 大臣
Blackmail.Quite so, Minister.

505
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,451
汉弗莱 我在想
Humphrey, I've been thinking.

506
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,817
要是格雷布克成了主席 他需要帮手吧?
Desmond Glazebrookwill need some support.

507
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,373
我想任命一个副主席
A Deputy Chairman,

508
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,259
一个搞过工业的人
someone with realexperience of Industry.

509
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,296
很好的想法 大臣
An excellent thought.

510
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,778
你有没有特别合适的人选供我参考?
Is there anyone you couldadvise me would be appropriate?

511
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,773
比如说工会会员?
ATrade Unionist, forexample?

512
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,535
乔・摩根怎样? 大臣
What about Joe Morgan,Minister?

513
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,099
乔・摩根!
Joe Morgan!

514
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,454
好主意 非常不错 汉弗莱
What an excellent idea.Well done.

515
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,895
公营机构要两个人才能运转 大臣
It takes two to quango, Minister.

516
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,889
马上联系他们
Get on to them both immediately.

517
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,938
我就是说这个 体制的问题所在
This is what's wrongwith the system!

518
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:58,217
任人唯亲 腐败交易
It's jobs forthe boys,quid pro quo corruption.

519
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,371
那我的公营机构裁减报告呢?
What about my quangoabolition paper?

520
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,771
很好 弗兰克 有独创性 有想象力
Very good, Frank.Original and imaginative.

521
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,168
新奇   新奇
Novel.          Novel.

522
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,455
我是认真的 你打算怎么办?
I'm serious about it.What are you going to do?

523
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,579
反正你不能把它封杀了
You're not going to suppress it.

524
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,618
我会呈给其他内阁成员 变成政党政策
I'll get it adopted as party policy.

525
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,055
要是交给媒体...
If the Press wereto get hold of this...

526
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,098
对 要是交给媒体
Yes, if the Presswere to get hold of this.

527
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,854
爆炸性新闻   弗兰克 我一直在想
What a story!Frank, I've been wondering.

528
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,693
你想进公营机构吗?
Have you everthoughtof serving on a quango?

529
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,657
没门 你贿赂不了我的
You're not corrupting me.

530
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,572
不 不 当然不是
No, no, of course not.

531
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,890
但可能与其废除
But perhapsbetterthan abolishing

532
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,018
整个体制 倒不如改造它
the entire systemwould be to make itwork.

533
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,139
汉弗莱和我认为 应该建立一个
Humphrey and I were thinking,if we were to set up

534
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,814
特别委员会来调查并报告
a special commissionto investigate and report

535
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,097
全部公营机构的组织活动
on the compositionand activities of all quangos,

536
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,012
这可能是解决之道
that might be the answer.

537
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,215
解决之道? 你一定是...
The answer!

538
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,816
得有很高资历 擅长绩效评估
Itwould have to be very senior,mostly Privy Councillors.

539
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,459
但同时得有实际能力
But itwould need toosome very able people

540
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,292
研究过公营机构的
who have studied quangos

541
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,690
深谙体系弊病所在
and knew the abusesof the system.

542
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,057
鉴于你的认识和关注
And in the lightof yourknowledge and concern,

543
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,859
汉弗莱提名你
Humphrey suggested yourname.

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,299
对吗 汉弗莱?   埃瑟尔先生 对
Didn't you, Humphrey?Mr. Weisel, I said.

545
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,970
你改变不了我的立场
You're not going to changemy opinions.

546
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,973
做人要正直   当然
There is such a thing as integrity.Of course.

547
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,654
由于你的立场和正直
Youropinions and your integritywould make you

548
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,890
这个公营机构成员非你莫属
such a valuable memberof this quango.

549
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,494
提醒你 这是个苦差
Mind you,itwould be very hard work.

550
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,018
这个超级公营机构成员
Service to this SuperQuangowould involve you

551
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,331
需要常常远赴国外
in some very arduousforeign travel,

552
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,209
博采各国政府之长
to see how these mattersare managed

553
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,575
研究应对之道
in other importantgovernment centres.

塔希提岛(太平洋小岛)   塔希提岛
Tahiti...            Tahiti.

558
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,619
是的 非常辛苦
Yes, thatwould be fairly arduous.

559
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:55,374
糟糕透了 糟糕之极
Dreadful. Dreadful.

560
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,653
但是这就是为人民服务 对吧?
But serving the public's whatit's all about, isn't it?

561
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,458
绝对正确   为人民服务

为人民服务
Serving the public.

那我的公营机构报告怎么说?
And my quango paper?

564
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,780
无价之宝 你留着吧
Invaluable, take itwith you.

可以的话 我会拿一份复本存档

566
