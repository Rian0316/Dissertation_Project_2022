第十二季  第二集

23
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,220
不過我覺得到了蜜月尾聲
But I think, by the end of the honeymoon,

24
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,670
我們真的開始有已婚夫婦感了
we really started to feel like a married couple.

25
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,650
是好的那種  像電視里那樣
But the good kind, like on TV,

26
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,530
-不是像我父母  -是的
- not like my parents. - Yeah.

27
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,510
真正的夫妻是當你可以撒尿不關門
You're not a real married couple until you can pee

28
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,740
而你老婆也無所謂時才算
with the door open and she's okay with it.

29
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,790
我跟你說過我有所謂
I told you, I'm not okay with it.

30
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,150
她愛死了
She loves it.

31
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:25,550
我們給大家都買了禮物
So, we got everybody gifts.

32
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,360
你們是不是到機場了才想起我們啊
Did you forget about us until you were at the airport?

33
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,580
才不是
No.

34
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,750
我們是到飛機上了才想起你們來
We forgot about you until we were on the plane.

35
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,000
幸好飛機上有無線網
Luckily, there was Wi-Fi, 

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,720
而我有網絡商城高速送貨服務
and I have Amazon Prime.

37
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,860
我?紐約
I heart New York.

38
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,390
寶寶一定會很喜歡吐在這上面
Aw, the baby's gonna love throwing up on this.

39
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,960
聽我說  這不見得只能代表紐約啊
Look, it doesn't have to just be New York.

40
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,880
這才是其中的奧妙之處
That's the beauty of it.

41
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,000
這個縮寫可以代表很多你們喜愛的事物
Uh, the initials "N.Y." can stand for anything you like.

42
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,670
舉個例子  我聽說有一個
For instance, I understand that there is

43
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,190
知名的老年搖滾歌手尼爾·楊
an elderly rock-and-roll musician named Neil Young.

44
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,440
或許你們喜歡他啊
Perhaps you heart him.

45
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,380
如果對他無感  埃及銀牌乒乓球手
Or if not him, Egyptian table tennis silver medalist

46
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,920
諾哈·亞瑟里
Noha Yossry.

47
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,190
也可以是山口奈奈
Or Nana Yamaguchi,

48
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,520
她是日本的女聲優
the Japanese voice actress

49
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,280
曾給卡通《仙女下凡》配過音
who starred in Sally the Witch.

50
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,560
你上網查了有誰縮寫是N.Y.的嗎
Did you just Google the initials "N.Y."?

51
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,250
飛行時間長而又剛好有網
I had Wi-Fi and a long plane flight.

52
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,770
你推理推理吧
Draw your own conclusions.

53
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,910
兩位  這禮物真是非常有心了  我...
Well, guys, that was very, very thoughtful of you. I...

54
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,790
你們給我買了XXL號的嗎
Did you get me a double XL?

55
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,270
-我跟你說太大了吧  -你說對了  親愛的
- I told you. - You were right, dear.

56
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,160
謝爾頓  感謝函不是這么寫的
Sheldon, that's not how you write a thank you card.

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,680
我寫的有哪里不對
What's wrong with it?

58
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,510
"親愛的海倫阿姨
"Dear Aunt Helen,

59
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,330
謝謝您送給我們的這套令人喜愛的餐具
Thank you so much for the lovely place setting.

60
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,160
如果我的字跡看起來不太自然
If my handwriting looks strained,

61
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,220
那是因為這是我被艾米逼著寫的
that is because this is the 16th thank you card

62
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,940
第16張感謝函
Amy has forced me to write.

63
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,770
我忍著用肌肉在抽筋的手腕
The muscles in my wrist are cramping

64
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,140
艱苦地寫完這句子
as I struggle to finish this sentence.

65
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,300
哎喲  哎喲  疼死我了
Ow, ow, oh, the pain.

66
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,570
愛你的謝爾頓敬上"
Love, Sheldon."

67
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,800
行行行
Fine.

68
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,490
"謝爾頓與艾米敬上"
"And Amy."

69
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,840
這份禮物是萊納德與佩妮送的
This one is from Leonard and Penny.

70
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,440
"完美的禮物贈于最完美的夫婦"
"The perfect gift for the perfect couple."

71
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,350
卡先留著  禮物不滿意就把卡甩回他們臉上
Save that card. We may need to throw it back in their faces.

72
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,450
我真好奇會是什么東西
I wonder what it could be.

73
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,000
什么東西都有可能
Oh, could be anything.

74
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,180
一支長笛  一把拆信刀
A flute, a letter opener,

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,190
或是帶裸女圖的筆
one of those pens

76
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,640
把筆正著拿  墨水就會變成遮羞的比基尼  
where you put the bikini back on the naked lady.

77
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,130
這東西不錯啊
Isn't this nice?

78
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,370
這是什么
What is it?

79
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,190
你懂的  就是...
You know, it's, uh,

80
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,610
就是那個...
it's one of those...

81
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,410
不是  沒作用
Nope, doesn't do that.

82
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,760
或許是糖果
Oh, maybe it's candy.

83
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,730
舔舔看
Lick it.

84
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,950
我才不要舔  你舔吧
I don't want to lick it. You lick it.

85
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,610
我才不要舔  我剛刷完牙
I'm not gonna lick it. I just brushed my teeth.

86
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,980
是你看的弱智科幻電視劇里的東西嗎
Is it from one of your dumb sci-fi shows?

87
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,880
我看的科幻電視劇都不弱智好嗎
Uh, none of the sci-fi shows I watch are dumb.

88
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,370
-謝爾頓少來  -好啦  《西部世界》弱智
- Sheldon... - Okay, Westworld.

89
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,830
但這跟那部劇沒有任何關聯啊
But this has nothing to do with that show,

90
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,800
唯一的關聯大概就是都令人懵逼
other than it's also inexplicable.

91
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,960
萊納德與佩妮是我們最好的朋友
Well, Leonard and Penny are our best friends.

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,510
他們比誰都了解我們倆
They know us better than anyone.

93
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:27,880
他們說這是完美的禮物
They said it's the perfect gift.

94
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,640
那我們肯定是漏了什么細節
We must be missing something.

95
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,460
你不會...
You don't...

96
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,820
覺得這是婚姻"輔助棒"吧
think it's a marital aid, do you?

97
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,500
別犯傻了
Don't be silly.

98
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,280
艾米  這根玻璃大棒哪里能輔助我們的婚姻啊
Amy, how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage?

99
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,360
你覺得當超級狗英雄在外面亂飛時
Do you think when Krypto the Superdog is out flying,

100
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,210
超人得拿著撿屎袋跟在它后面嗎
Superman has to fly after him with a little baggie?

101
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,680
這點以前我還真沒想過
Hmm. Haven't really thought about it before.

102
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,360
但超人應該不需要用撿屎袋
But he doesn't need a baggie,

103
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,270
他可以直接用熱能光線把屎給炸了
because he just blasts the poop with his heat vision.

104
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,470
你以前絕對想過這件事
You've thought about it before.

105
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,280
其實我可常想了
Oh, I've thought about it a lot.

106
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,340
斯圖爾特的臉出了什么問題
What is wrong with Stuart's face?

107
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,970
他好像是在微笑
I think he's smiling.

108
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,230
天啊  他們是在聊騷嗎
Oh, my God, are they flirting?

109
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,410
他們早就過了聊騷期
Oh, they're way past flirting.

110
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,880
我抓到他們在謝爾頓的婚禮上親熱了
I caught them making out at Sheldon's wedding.

111
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,250
你確定她不是在幫他做人工呼吸嗎
Are you sure she wasn't trying to breathe life back into him?

112
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,750
應該不是
I don't think so.

113
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,630
當我在心肺復蘇課上伸那么多舌頭時
When I used that much tongue at CPR training,

114
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,080
他們會逼我買下那假人
I had to buy the dummy.

115
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,390
我有課
Ooh, I have class.

116
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:42,950
我該走了
I should go.

117
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,030
好的
Oh. Okay.

118
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,130
-再見  -再見
- Bye. - Bye.

119
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,920
大家再見
See ya, guys.

120
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,980
-再見  -再見啦
- Bye. - Bye.

121
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,400
她現在是怎么樣
So, what's her deal?

122
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,030
她是真對你有意思  還是想氣自己父母
Is she into you or does she just hate her parents?

123
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,170
我不知道啊
I-I don't know.

124
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,960
我們在婚禮上親熱了一下
We kissed a little at the wedding,

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,330
感覺一切很美好
and it was great.

126
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,510
但之后我們沒有好好談過
But we haven't really talked about it since then.

127
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,800
所以我也不知道她對我有何感覺
So I-I don't know how she feels about me.

128
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,840
她摸了摸你的頭
Well, she patted you on the head,

129
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,670
所以我猜她覺得你是個乖狗狗
so I'm guessing she feels like you're such a good boy!

130
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,170
說認真的  你們覺得我該去約她嗎
Seriously, do you think I should ask her out?

131
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,900
必須啊
A-Absolutely.

132
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,680
別讓真愛溜走
Don't let love get away.

133
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,860
愛情是世界上最重要的東西
It is the most important thing in the world.

134
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,810
沒了愛情  生命一片黑暗且毫無意義
Without it, life is dark and meaningless and all you're left with

135
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,350
你剩下的就只有
is the judgmental gaze of your dog

136
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,300
獨自在馬桶上吃完零食后  你家狗鄙視的眼神
as you finish off a bag of Doritos on the toilet.

137
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,820
謝謝你
Thanks.

138
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,280
你真是個好朋友
You're a real good pal.

139
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,510
你現在也是乖狗狗啦
And now you're a good boy!

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,630
我無法停止想那個禮物是什么
I can't stop thinking about that present.

141
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,820
我快要發瘋了
It's driving me crazy.

142
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,050
我也是
Me, too!

143
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,280
卡片寫著那是完美的禮物
The card said it was the perfect gift.

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,030
但它不是恐龍化石也不是情侶懷表
But it's not a dinosaur fossil or matching pocket watches,

145
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,470
所以我看不出它如何能完美
so I don't see how it can be.

146
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,960
或許是我們想太多了
Maybe we're trying too hard.

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,590
它可能很簡單
Maybe it's something simple.

148
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,600
就像他們夫婦一樣頭腦簡單
Like Leonard and Penny.

149
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,590
很好  有道理
Yes, good.

150
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,950
我們只需要進入他們的思維
We just need to think like them.

151
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,010
好
Okay.

152
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,200
有什么禮物能送謝家夫婦
What gift can I get us

153
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,240
來表達對他們進入我們生命的感謝之情
to express how grateful we are to have us in their lives?

154
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,950
你可真會簡化啊
Way to make it simple.

155
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,090
我直接去問他們吧
I'm just gonna ask them.

156
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,280
不行  這會傷了他們的感情
No, you can't; it'll hurt their feelings.

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,540
這我無所謂啊
I'm okay with that.

158
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,780
而且他們也會知道你不夠聰明
And they'll know you weren't smart enough

159
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,960
來解出他們送了什么禮物
to figure it out on your own.

160
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,580
你說得對  這真是太討厭了
You're right. Oh, this is awful.

161
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,620
而且我都不能靠撫摸
And I can't even comfort myself by stroking

162
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,300
五角龍脛骨化石來安慰自己
the fossilized tibia of a Pentaceratops.

163
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,980
我們先睡一覺吧
Let's just go to sleep.

164
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,750
一覺醒來我們就能用全新視角來看
We'll look at it in the morning with fresh eyes,

165
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,250
說不定一切就會水到渠成
and maybe it'll come to us.

166
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,080
好吧
Fine.

167
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,140
又或者我們去拆了那盒子  尋找線索
Or we go tear apart that box and look for a clue.

168
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,950
過了我睡眠時間不睡覺去玩解謎游戲
Staying up past my bedtime and solving mysteries?

169
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,840
誰能想到婚姻生活會如此美好
Who knew married life could be this good?

170
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,160
他的臉出了什么問題
What's wrong with his face?

171
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,710
最近很多人都問過這個問題
A lot of people have been asking that.

172
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,400
他在...微笑
He's... smiling.

173
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,410
斯圖爾特  你看起來心情很好啊
Hey, Stuart, you look pretty happy.

174
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,570
是啊
Oh, yeah.

175
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,100
我約德妮絲去約會
I, uh, asked Denise out on a date,

176
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,410
她答應了
and she said yes.

177
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,860
太好了
Aw. That's great.

178
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,380
但別在哈雷面前這樣笑
But don't smile like that in front of Halley.

179
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,210
她最近才開始能一覺睡到天亮
She just started sleeping through the night.

180
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,320
抱歉  我很興奮
Sorry. I'm excited.

181
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,080
我很久沒約過會了
I haven't been on a date in a long time.

182
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,380
我還約會那會兒  
Back when I was dating, 

183
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,410
我總會穿新內褲  以免"艷福"來了不好看
I'd always wear a new pair of underwear, just in case.

184
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,000
我也很久沒買過新內褲了
It's also been a long time since I bought new underwear.

185
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,060
估計該買了
And I probably should,

186
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,050
從緊身白內褲變成松垮灰破褲了
because these are no longer tighty nor whitey.

187
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,690
老娘要閃人了
Okay, I'm out.

188
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,890
當別人有機會看到你的裸體時
If there's a chance someone's gonna see you naked,

189
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,290
你先修剪梳理好"雜毛"是基本禮儀
it's also polite to make sure you're well-groomed down there.

190
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,150
知道了  霍華德  老娘最近太忙了
I get it, Howard. I've been busy!

191
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,690
你們好呀
Hello.

192
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,460
我想過來親手把感謝信交給你們
I just wanted to pop over and hand-deliver this thank you note

193
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,910
感謝你們送了貼心的新婚禮物
for your very thoughtful wedding gift. 

194
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,250
真好  你們喜歡那個禮物嗎
Oh, good. You guys liked it?

195
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,630
喜歡它多過喜歡不是它的事物
Well, we liked it a lot more than things that aren't it,

196
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,140
我就這么說吧
I'll tell you that.

197
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,640
那可太好了
Well, yeah, that's great.

198
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,810
因為我們看到這東西時便想到
Because when we saw it, we thought, 

199
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,660
"艾米和謝爾頓必須得有這個"
"Amy and Sheldon just have to have that."

200
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,710
愿聞其詳  把當時的情形描述一下
Oh, do tell. Now, paint a picture for me,

201
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,770
這禮物你們在哪發現的
like where you were when you found it

202
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,870
你們覺得我們會喜歡用它來做什么
and what you thought we'd enjoy doing with it.

203
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,030
你是不是不知道那是什么
Do you not know what it is?

204
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,770
他當然知道了
Of course he knows what it is. 

205
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,870
他可是全世界最聰明的人
He's the smartest man in the world.

206
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,390
全世界我可不敢肯定
Well, I don't know about the world.

207
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,250
還有些也挺聰明的中國人呢
Some of those Chinese fellas are pretty clever.

208
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,360
失陪一下
Now, if you'll excuse me,

209
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,250
我要回家使用你們送的禮物
I'm going to return home and use your gift

210
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,330
而且是按它原本的用途來使用
in the manner which it was intended.

211
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,780
他永遠都不會猜到
He-He's never gonna figure it out.

212
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,570
就是啊
I know.

213
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,420
你到底是什么鬼
What are you?!

214
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,740
-我真是要開心壞了  -對啊
- Gosh, this makes me happy. - Yeah.

215
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,690
霍華德  這話我不常說
Howard, I don't often say this,

216
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,510
但你在這真的太好了
but, good, you're here. Now,

217
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,710
你知道萊納德夫婦送了什么新婚禮物給我們嗎
do you know what Leonard and Penny got us for our wedding gift?

218
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,010
-這個嘛  -別回答
- Well... - Don't answer.

219
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,830
我不想知道答案
I don't want to know.

220
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,660
我只想知道你是否知道
I just want to know if you know.

221
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,270
-我知道  -很好
- I do know. - Okay, great.

222
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,570
我認為我和艾米已經猜到了
I believe that Amy and I have figured it out.

223
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,980
禮物是不是尋寶游戲的線索
Is it a clue to a scavenger hunt

224
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,130
它將會指引我們找到真正的禮物
that will lead us to the actual present?

225
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,220
如果你是在問
If you're asking

226
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,580
你和艾米未來幾天是否該滿城跑
if you and Amy should spend the next couple days

227
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,090
尋找下一條線索
running all over town searching for the next clue,

228
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,250
那我只能說  是的
I'm gonna have to say yes.

229
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,930
我就知道
I knew it!

230
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,350
這太好玩了
This is so much fun.

231
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,990
真的好玩死了
Oh, it really is.

232
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,600
萊納德  再次謝謝你
Oh, Leonard, thank you again.

233
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,400
我們愛死那份禮物了
We love the gift.

234
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,950
他知道那是什么了嗎
Does he know what it is?

235
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,000
邊都沒沾上
No, not even close.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,970
他以為禮物是尋寶游戲的線索
He thinks it's a clue to a scavenger hunt.

237
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,810
小爺我開心壞了
So, so happy.

238
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,220
你們送了什么禮物給他們
Well, what is it? What did you give them?

239
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,780
就是我們結婚時
Oh, I-it's just this dumb crystal wand

240
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,150
霍華德夫婦送給我們的一根智障水晶棒
that Howard and Bernadette gave us for our wedding.

241
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,930
佩妮和我想得頭都大了
Penny and I made each other miserable

242
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,070
都沒猜到是什么  于是我們尋思
trying to figure out what it was, and we thought,

243
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,610
"不如把這份樂趣傳給謝爾頓和艾米吧"
"Why not pass that fun along to Sheldon and Amy."

244
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,860
等等  你...
Wait a minute. Did--

245
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,500
你把我送給你們的結婚禮物
did you give them the crystal chakra wand

246
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,460
水晶脈輪能量棒送給他們了嗎
that I gave you for your wedding?

247
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,040
對  我們是這么做了
Yeah, that's exactly what we did.

248
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,670
你說你喜歡這禮物啊
You said you liked it!

249
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,780
對  我是這么說了
Yeah, that's exactly what I said.

250
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,780
尋寶游戲啊
Wow. A scavenger hunt.

251
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,380
真令人興奮
That's exciting.

252
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,160
我昨晚也玩了尋寶游戲
I had a bit of a scavenger hunt myself last night.

253
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,970
我想找遙控器
I was trying to find the remote.

254
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,920
找了一下沙發坐墊底下
I looked under one of the cushions.

255
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,140
沒有
Wasn't there.

256
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,500
然后我把坐墊再掀高一點
Then I lifted the cushion a little higher.

257
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,990
找到了
Bingo.

258
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,740
精彩
Riveting.

259
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,890
你知道這是什么嗎
So, do you know what it is?

260
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,610
我當然知道了
Of course I know what it is.

261
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,560
這是二氧化硅晶體  也就是石英
It's a silicon dioxide crystal, otherwise known as quartz.

262
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,780
你確定嗎
Are you sure?

263
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,540
還我確定嗎  玄武巖是由富含鎂鐵的熔巖
Am I sure? Is basalt a mafic extrusive igneous rock formed

264
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,820
快速冷卻形成的鎂鐵質火成巖嗎
by the rapid cooling of magnesium and iron-rich lava?

265
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,050
我當然確定了
Yeah, I'm sure.

266
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,330
所以是石英
Okay, so it's quartz.

267
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,740
這一定有什么含義
That's got to mean something.

268
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,090
我們對石英有什么認識
What do we know about quartz?

269
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,240
我上網查一下
I'll Google it.

270
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,360
你也可以問我這個
Or you can ask me, 

271
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,060
榮獲麥克阿瑟天才獎的地質學家
the geologist who won the MacArthur Genius Grant.

272
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,870
查到了
Got it!

273
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,570
石英一詞來自德語
Quartz, from the German "Quarz"

274
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,940
兩詞發音相同  但英語拼寫多了一個"T"
which sounds the same, but is spelled without a "T".

275
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,610
有意思  沒有"T"
Interesting. No "T".

276
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,050
什么東西非"T"也[音似"茶"]
What is not "T"?

277
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,450
咖啡
Coffee!

278
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,930
我們第一次見面的那家咖啡店
The coffee shop where we first met!

279
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,460
好的  咱們走  抱歉
All right, let's go. Sorry.

280
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,660
難得有人來找我  我不禁腎上腺素飆升
I think I just had an adrenaline rush from having visitors.

281
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,960
拉杰  你能幫我聞個東西嗎
Hey, Raj, will you, um, smell something for me?

282
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,760
看情況
Uh, that depends.

283
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,700
其實不用看  我直接拒絕
Actually, it doesn't depend. Just no.

284
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,040
我在試跟德妮絲約會要用的新古龍水
I'm trying out some new colognes for my date with Denise.

285
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,420
所以你就直接到我跟前
Oh, and you just came over here

286
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,350
炫耀你跟妹子有約會嗎
to rub it in my face that you have a date?

287
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:58,980
不是
No.

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,090
我來找你是因為我需要建議
I came over here because I need advice,

289
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,870
而你是我認識的人里  跟最多妹子約過會的
and you've gone out with more women than anybody I know.

290
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,610
我想你說得對
Huh. I guess you're right.

291
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,420
謝爾頓最聰明  霍華德最幽默
Sheldon's the smart one, Howard's the funny one,

292
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,400
而本公子  很明顯是最花的
and apparently, I'm the ladies' man.

293
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,220
那萊納德呢
Which one's Leonard?

294
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,140
對哦
Oh, yeah, right.

295
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,990
萊納德應該是最沒存在感的
I guess Leonard's the forgettable one.

296
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,130
好  我來聞一下
Okay, let's have a whiff.

297
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,010
聞起來像帕高·拉巴納牌的香水
Hmm. Smells like Paco Rabanne.

298
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,230
你真厲害  我在跳蚤市場買的
Ooh, you're good. I bought it at a swap meet.

299
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,690
名字就叫"聞起來像帕高·拉巴納的香水"
It's actually called "Smells Like Paco Rabanne."

300
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,380
很好  她會喜歡的
It's great. She's gonna love it.

301
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,270
但愿如此
I hope so.

302
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,030
我真的很喜歡德妮絲  我不想搞砸了
I really like Denise, and I don't want to screw this up.

303
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,200
放輕松
Hey, relax.

304
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,320
相信你的直覺  我就是這么做的
Trust your instincts. That's what I do.

305
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,770
這讓你縱橫情場了嗎
And that works for you?

306
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,130
事實上  沒有
Actually... no.

307
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,500
我把自己的人生搞得一團糟
I've made a mess of my life, and I'm...

308
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,260
現在孤苦無依
I'm all alone.

309
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,850
我最好還是假裝要走開接電話吧
Okay, I think it'd be best for both of us

310
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,000
這樣場面不會這么尷尬
if I pretend to get a phone call and just walk away.

311
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,650
行  這樣最好
Yeah, that would be best.

312
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,830
你好  我是斯圖爾特
Hello. This is Stuart.

313
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,150
抱歉  我得接個電話
Sorry. I got to take this.

314
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,110
當然  我樂意做問卷調查
Uh, why, yes, I'd love to take a survey.

315
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,680
這是我們初次相遇的地方
Okay, this is where we first met.

316
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,200
肯定在某個地方有線索
There's got to be a clue here somewhere.

317
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,730
我們坐的是那張桌子
We sat at that table.

318
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,010
你這是做什么
Excuse me.

319
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,780
抱歉  我們在尋寶
I'm sorry. We're on a scavenger hunt.

320
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,800
無視我們就行 
Just pretend we're not here.

321
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,140
我找到了
Oh, I found something!

322
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,060
是口香糖
It's gum.

323
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,390
也許他們放在柜臺后面
Maybe they left it behind the counter.

324
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,530
我和妻子在這里相遇  當時坐的就是這張桌子
I met my wife here, and we sat at this very table,

325
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,890
所以如果你好好表現  八年后
so if you play your cards right, in eight years,

326
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,300
你就可以娶這位女士
you could marry this woman.

327
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,810
這是我妹妹
That's my sister.

328
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,020
別說出來  兄妹戀可不好
Well, don't tell people. That's not okay.

329
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,520
謝爾頓  你看  我問咖啡師
Sheldon, look, I asked the barista

330
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,900
是否有人留東西給我們
if anyone left anything for us,

331
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,340
她讓我們在失物招領箱中找
and she said to look in this lost and found box.

332
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,750
但為什么會在失物招領箱里
But why would it be in the lost and found box?

333
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,950
因為我們曾經迷失  結果找到了彼此
Because we were lost, and then we found each other.

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,730
這太有道理了
It makes perfect sense.

335
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,180
看這個
Oh. And look at this.

336
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,610
一個吊墜
A locket.

337
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,060
上面的石頭  我打賭是石英
And that stone in front-- I bet it's quartz.

338
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,980
肯定是這個  這個才是真正的禮物
This must be it. This must be the actual gift.

339
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,390
打開  里面有什么
Open it up. What's inside?

340
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,660
沒東西  空的
Nothing. It's empty.

341
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,990
當然了
Of course.

342
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,930
我們共同的生活才剛剛開始
Our life together is just starting,

343
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,900
他們希望我們用共同的回憶填滿它
and they want us to fill it with our memories.

344
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,480
這可能是史上最貼心的結婚禮物了
This might be the best wedding gift ever.

345
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,650
他們還給我們送了副墨鏡
They also left us a pair of sunglasses

346
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,750
因為我們的未來太耀眼了
because our future's so bright!

347
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,910
他們想得太周到了
They thought of everything!

348
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,810
看哈雷的畫
Look what Halley drew.

349
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,590
她在托兒所畫的
Yeah, she made it at daycare.

350
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,070
畫得真不錯啊
It's pretty good, huh?

351
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,640
是嗎
Is it?

352
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,440
非猶太媽媽好嚴格啊
Wow. Gentile moms are tough.

353
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,890
兩位  我要給你們看點東西
Guys, I need to show you something,

354
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,590
但你們得保證不能取笑我
but you have to promise not to make fun of me.

355
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,520
那當然
Of course.

356
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,440
我很擔心約會的事
Yeah. I was worried about the date

357
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,940
所以給頭發染了色  讓自己更加自信
so I got my hair colored to make me feel a little more confident,

358
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,820
結果更顯皮膚蒼白  所以我去做了美黑
but that just made me look paler, so I-I got a spray tan.

359
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,550
你試過沖澡了嗎
Have you tried showering,

360
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,400
看是否能擦洗掉
seeing if you could scrub it off?

361
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,710
試了
I did.

362
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,210
你們需要買新的毛巾
You're gonna need some new towels.

363
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,990
浴室腳墊
And a bathmat.

364
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,970
還有馬桶座圈
And a toilet seat.

365
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,900
一小時后我就得去接她
I'm picking her up in an hour.

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,450
我該怎么辦
What am I gonna do?!

367
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,660
你是不是應該說
Don't you mean what are you gonna

368
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,190
"你要嗚巴魯巴怎么辦"
"Oompa Loompa doompety do"?

369
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,190
{\an8}《查理和巧克力工廠》里的橙色小矮人唱的歌

370
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,300
你說你不會嘲笑我的
You said you weren't gonna make any jokes.

371
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,140
抱歉  我不說了
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

372
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,530
我不會停
I won't stop.

373
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,500
只是噴霧美黑
Look, it's only a spray tan.

374
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,240
幾天就褪色了
It'll fade in a couple days.

375
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
你不如取消約會  再安排時間
Why don't you cancel the date and reschedule?

376
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,700
但我超級期待今晚呢
Oh, but I was really looking forward to tonight.

377
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,530
那就去吧  把實情告訴她
You know what? Then go. Tell her what happened.

378
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,250
-也許她會高興  -如果她不高興
- Maybe she'll be flattered. - And if not,

379
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,710
就順路去巧克力工廠  看那里是否招工
swing by the chocolate factory and see if they're hiring.

380
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,880
這不是笑話  這是真心的建議
That wasn't a joke. That was a legitimate suggestion.

381
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,210
喂
Hello?

382
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,280
老爸
Hey, Dad.

383
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,220
拉杰什  真是驚喜  居然在我生日時打給我
Rajesh. What a nice surprise, calling me on my birthday.

384
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,090
對  我就是為這事打來的
Yes. That's why I'm calling.

385
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,500
還有什么生日禮物比得上
And-and what better gift to give you than the gift

386
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,690
我滿足你的期望去娶一個印度女人呢
of marrying an Indian woman, just like you've always wanted.

387
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,000
我的天  拉杰什  這是天大的好消息
My goodness, Rajesh, this is exciting news.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,130
她是誰
Who is she?

389
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,350
你告訴我啊
You tell me.

390
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,330
什么
What?

391
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,840
我希望你幫我安排一樁婚姻
I want you to arrange a marriage for me.

392
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,520
我實在是厭倦了單身
I'm just so tired of being single,

393
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,090
我終于...我準備好成家了
and I'm finally just... I'm-I'm ready to settle down.

394
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,960
我不能隨便打電話給一個姑娘的爸爸
I can't just call up some girl's dad

395
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,550
讓她嫁給你啊
and make her marry you.

396
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,800
現在可不是2015年的世道了
It's-it's not 2015 anymore.

397
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:13,300
我知道  但我一個人結不了婚  我需要你幫忙 
I know that, but I can't do this on my own. I need your help.

398
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,100
那我也需要你的幫助
Well, then, I'm going to need your help, too.

399
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,110
如果我要幫你介紹一個女人
If I'm going to find a woman to set you up with,

400
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,850
你就不能再在網上發你和你的狗
you're going to need to stop Instagramming pictures

401
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,710
穿情侶毛衣的照片
of you and your dog wearing matching sweaters.

402
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:29,760
行  為了讓你看到我的誠意  我同意
Fine, if that's what it takes to show you that I'm serious.

403
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,860
問一下
Uh, quick question.

404
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,930
你是單指照片分享網  還是所有社交網...
Do you mean just Instagram, or all my social...?

405
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,010
全部的
All of them!

406
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,960
好  說定了
Okay, deal.

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,140
好  那我問你一個問題
All right. Let me ask you a question.

408
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,380
你覺得這個女孩怎么樣
What do you think of this woman?

409
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,360
我的天  好漂亮
Oh. Oh, my God, she's beautiful.

410
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,430
這是你要給我介紹的對象嗎
Is that who you're going to set me up with?

411
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,260
不  這是我在泡的妞
No! That's who I'm dating.

412
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,410
但也許她有姐姐
But maybe she has an older sister.

413
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,530
所以我們在里面放了我的照片
So we put a little picture of me

414
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,670
還有謝爾頓的照片
and a little picture of Sheldon in it.

415
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,850
放進吊墜里
In-in the locket?

416
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,620
是的
Yes.

417
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,060
之前是在失物招領箱里的吊墜
That was in a lost and found box?

418
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,530
沒錯
Exactly.

419
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,860
我們把它藏在那里
Where we hid it?

420
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,010
真的  你們送了我們三件超棒的禮物
So really, you gave us three amazing gifts.

421
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,800
你們送了吊墜  精彩冒險
You gave the locket, the adventure

422
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,950
并且讓艾米和我發現只要我倆合作
and the realization that Amy and I can do anything

423
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,630
便無所不能
as long as we work together.

424
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,870
我們給你們寫了張特別的感謝卡
We wrote you a special thank you note. 

425
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,580
這些是文字嗎
Are those words?

426
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,190
不是
No.

427
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,000
這是要你倆一起破譯的密碼
It's a secret code that you two get to figure out together.

428
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,670
提示  這是以梵文為基礎的
Hint, it's based on Sanskrit,

429
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,090
但不是你們以為的那種梵文
but not the Sanskrit you're thinking of.

430
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,760
最精彩的在于  你們不能作弊上網查
And best of all, you can't use the Internet to cheat.

431
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,680
因為我們鎖住了你們的無線網
Because we locked you out of your Wi-Fi,

432
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,140
而答案就是新密碼
and the answer to this is your new password.

433
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,860
我不開心了
I'm no longer happy.

434
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,360
各位  好消息
Hey, guys. Great news.

435
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,540
我要結婚了
I'm getting married.

436
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,000
-什么  -不
- What? - No.

437
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,520
我還沒見過她
Well, I-I haven't met her yet,

438
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,680
她叫安努
but her name is Anu.

439
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,410
我父親說她出身良好家庭
My father says she comes from a good family.

440
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:28,550
30多歲
She's in her 30s.

441
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:30,490
她做酒店管理工作
She works in hospitality management.

442
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,300
只要我能挺過六到十次約會
So, as long as I can get through six to ten dates

443
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,330
不暴露我的真面目
without revealing my true self...

444
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,250
我就真能結婚了
...this is happening.

445
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:42,860
我知道我們要送什么結婚禮物了
I know just what we're giving them for a wedding gift.

446
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,160
我的天
Oh, my God.

447
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,480
是的
Yeah.

448
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,450
我希望在約會時展現自己最好的一面
I wanted to look my best for our date,

449
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,150
于是我做了一系列悲催的決定
and I made a series of bad decisions...

450
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,360
其中一個悲催決定被我褲子遮住了
...one of which is hidden by my pants.

451
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,880
你還想和我約會嗎
Do you still want to go out with me?

452
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,050
當然  也許我們可以一起去找尼莫
Absolutely. Hey, maybe we can go find Nemo together.

453
