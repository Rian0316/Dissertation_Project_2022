萨顿
Sutton,

27
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:26,650
萨顿!
Sutton!

28
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:46,465
住院的病人
The Resident Patient

29
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:06,384
放松点 福尔摩斯
Mustn't take it so badly Holmes.

30
00:04:10,034 --> 00:04:10,868
什么?
What?

31
00:04:10,868 --> 00:04:12,953
我知道这么说有点难为情
Well I know it's inconvenient but you really mustn't

32
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:14,622
但你不能让它影响你的
let it affect you like this.

33
00:04:15,874 --> 00:04:17,229
你在说什么啊?
Whatever do you mean?

34
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:21,401
你一直怒愤难抑
You are sitting there boiling with indignation

35
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,548
因为你被迫离开
because you have been forced to leave

36
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:25,676
221B这么一间舒适的公寓
the warmth and comfort of 221B by the order

37
00:04:25,677 --> 00:04:28,597
哈德森太太正在进行春季大扫除
of Mrs. Hudson's spring cleaning.

38
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,645
我亲爱的华生 你是怎么推断出的?
My dear Watson however did you deduce that?

39
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,191
只是简单地运用了下你的方法罢了
By simply applying your methods Holmes.

40
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:39,442
是么?
Indeed?

41
00:04:40,068 --> 00:04:41,840
相信你来这里
You'll agree that you are not here

42
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,926
不是为了剪发或刮胡
for either a shave or a haircut.

43
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:45,074
这是事实
That is true.

44
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:46,116
你怎么知道的呢?
How did you know?

45
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:49,350
因为很明显你自己已经刮了胡子
Because you invariably shave yourself and you are patently

46
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,644
而距你下一次剪发还有两周的时间
not due for a haircut for another two weeks.

47
00:04:52,896 --> 00:04:53,834
正确
Correct.

48
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:57,066
你刚才很匆忙地离开了房间
And you left our rooms in some haste.

49
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,091
你没有戴手套 也没有拿手杖
You are without either your gloves or your cane.

50
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,993
继续
Go on.

51
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:09,789
嗯 我知道哈德森太太一直在
Well, I know that Mrs. Hudson's been trying to complete

52
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,562
忙活着春季大扫除
her spring cleaning all day.

53
00:05:12,501 --> 00:05:15,108
现如今 你静坐于此
Now, you have been sitting there

54
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,966
双眉紧锁 闭目不语
frowning, eyes tightly closed,

55
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:20,427
咬牙切齿
grinding your teeth,

56
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:21,678
一直击打着手指
and all the time your fingers

57
00:05:21,678 --> 00:05:22,825
就像活塞运动一样有规律地
have been drumming like pistons

58
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,390
击打着椅子扶手
on the arm of that chair.

59
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,917
愚钝如我也不难推断出
So given all this at once even I cannot fail to deduce

60
00:05:30,126 --> 00:05:33,254
你和我们善良的管家吵架了
that you are have quarreled with our good housekeeper

61
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:36,486
然后就来理发店寻找安宁
and sought refuge in the sanity of the barbershop.

62
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,848
无可否认 我的推断是正确的
You cannot deny that I am right.

63
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:47,019
噢 华生 这样你就
Oh, Watson you could not be

64
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,688
大错特错了
further from the truth.

65
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,860
我是来征询理发师的意见的
I am here to get our good barber's advice

66
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,154
这个是在案发现场找到的头发样本
as to the specimen of hair found at the scene

67
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:58,074
是上周二在德布福特发生的血腥惨剧
of a bloody misadventure last Tuesday in Debford.

68
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,951
噢 快点说吧 福尔摩斯
Oh, come along Holmes.

69
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,723
你肯定是在担心什么的
You're worried about something.

70
00:06:01,724 --> 00:06:04,226
你口中所说的焦虑
What you perceived as agitation

71
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:09,337
实际上是平静的享受才是
was indeed most intense tranquil enjoyment.

72
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:13,299
我双目紧闭是因为
My eyes were closed because I was trying to recall

73
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,158
昨夜演奏会上的盛况
as vividly as I could the concert

74
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:19,244
如此让人回味
that we attended last night.

75
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,164
你在咬牙切齿
You were grinding your teeth.

76
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,562
那是因为我在回想
That is because I made a slight error

77
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,212
厄尔吉安弹奏贝多芬的小提琴协奏曲
in my recollection of Urkian's fingering

78
00:06:28,213 --> 00:06:31,133
第三章的华彩部分时
his cadenza in the third movement

79
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,593
出了一点小小的差错
of the Beethoven Violin Concerto

80
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:46,671
不过话说回头
Nevertheless there is an element of truth

81
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,505
你所说的还是有点道理的
in what you say.

82
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:48,548
啊
Ah.

83
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:11,387
一个医生
A doctor's,

84
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:13,786
一位全科医生 我想
a general practitioner's I perceive,

85
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:17,018
开业不久 或许生意还不错
not been long in practice or had much to do,

86
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,209
他是来找我们商量事情的
come to consult us I fancy.

87
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,085
我们回来得太巧了
Lucky we came back.

88
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,617
啊 福尔摩斯先生
Ah, Mr. Holmes.

89
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,868
谢谢 哈德森夫人
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

90
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:55,291
医生 这是我的朋友兼同事 华生先生
Doctor, this is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson.

91
00:07:55,813 --> 00:07:59,150
请坐 阁下莅临寒舍 未知所为何事
Pray resume your seat and tell me how I may serve you.

92
00:07:59,672 --> 00:08:03,426
我的确是医生 我叫珀西・特里维廉
Well, I am indeed a doctor and my name is Percy Travelian

93
00:08:03,426 --> 00:08:05,720
住在布鲁克街403号
and I live at number 403 Brook Street.

94
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,180
你不就是
Aren't you the author

95
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,431
《原因不明的神经损伤》
of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?

96
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:10,830
那篇论文的作者吗?
of a monograph upon obscure nervous lesions?

97
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,020
是的 但甚少听人提及
Yes, but I so seldom hear of the work

98
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,688
我还以为早被遗忘了呢
I thought it quite dead.

99
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,816
怎么会呢
By no means.

100
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:18,859
出版商向我说
My publishers have given me

101
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,571
这本书销路不广
a most discouraging account of its sales.

102
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,595
你也是从医的吗?
You are yourself a medical man?

103
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,264
退役的外科军医
Retired army surgeon.

104
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:30,019
我对神经病学很感兴趣
My hobby has always been the study of nervous disease.

105
00:08:30,436 --> 00:08:31,896
我很希望能够对它
I should of course like to make it

106
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:34,398
进行专门研究 不过 一个人
an absolute specialty but a man

107
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,589
当然必须从事他首先能够着手的工作
must take what he can get first.

108
00:08:36,902 --> 00:08:40,030
显然 这是题外话了
However, this is beside the question

109
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:42,428
福尔摩斯先生 我知道
and I do appreciate, Mr. Holmes,

110
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,306
你的时间是多么宝贵
how very valuable your time is.

111
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:48,477
在布鲁克街我的寓所里
The fact is that a singular train of events

112
00:08:48,477 --> 00:08:50,875
最近发生了一连串非常奇怪的事情
has occurred recently at my house in Brook Street

113
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,856
今晚 这些事情已经到了非常严重的关头
and tonight they came to such a head

114
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,985
我感到实在不能再耽误了
that I felt it was impossible to wait another hour

115
00:08:55,986 --> 00:08:58,801
必须马上来请你出出主意 帮个忙
before asking for your advice and your assistance.

116
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:01,617
你要我出主意 帮忙 我非常欢迎
You are very welcome to both.

117
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,230
请把那些使你感到不安的事情
Let me have a detailed account of the circumstances

118
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,481
详细地讲给我听听
which have disturbed you.

119
00:09:10,482 --> 00:09:12,046
其中有一两件事如此琐碎
Well one or two of them are so trivial

120
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:15,174
以至于我都不好意思提及
that I am almost ashamed to mention them.

121
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,634
不过这件事令人非常莫名片妙
But the matter is so inexplicable

122
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,928
而近来变得更加复杂
and the recent turn it has taken so elaborate

123
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:21,327
我只好把一切都摆在你面前
that I shall lay it all before you and you shall judge

124
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,412
请你取其精华 去其糟粕
what is essential and what is not.

125
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,191
我是伦敦大学毕业的
I am a London University man and I am not unduly

126
00:09:30,192 --> 00:09:34,572
可以说我是优等生 绝不是自吹自擂
singing my praises when I say I was a very promising student

127
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,865
我的前途
And it was thought a distinguished career

128
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,117
一片光明
lay before me.

129
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:41,245
然而 就在此时 最大的障碍出现了
However, there was one great stumbling block.

130
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:42,393
钱?
Money?

131
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,208
是的 医生 钱
Indeed doctor, money.

132
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,858
我需要一笔资金开始行医
I needed capital not only to practice

133
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,736
以及逃离我被迫租下的
but also to get out of the scrawled rooms

134
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:52,300
一团糟的公寓
I was forced to rent.

135
00:09:52,822 --> 00:09:54,907
要连像样点的设备都没有
I could not expect my patients to trust me

136
00:09:55,325 --> 00:09:57,410
又怎么能叫我的病人相信我呢
if I could not afford the proper equipment.

137
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,121
是啊 这已经是司空见惯了
Yes, I've seen it happen to too many of us.

138
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,520
我也被迫从军
I myself was obliged to go into the army

139
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,292
以此来开始我的职业
in order to follow my career.

140
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:05,440
是啊
Indeed.

141
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,152
我想过放弃自己的职业
I had thought of abandoning my own career

142
00:10:08,673 --> 00:10:12,218
但是突如其来的一件事改变了我的主意
except for one sudden and unexpected incident.

143
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,617
到底是怎样的事呢?
Exactly what kind of incident?

144
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,015
两年前的一个早上
One morning two years ago

145
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:20,353
一个男人上门造访 他的名字叫布莱星顿
I received a visit from a man by the name of Blessington 

146
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:23,481
在此之前我们素未谋面
who until that time had been a complete stranger to me.

147
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:45,694
请进
Come in.

148
00:10:53,203 --> 00:10:56,644
老天爷啊 你就住这 就这里?
Good heavens, do you live here, in this?

149
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:59,460
是的 恐怕如此
Yes, I'm afraid I do.

150
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,858
你就是那位
You are the same Percy Travelian

151
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,944
取得卓越成就
who's had so distinguished a career,

152
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:06,552
最近获奖的珀西・特里维廉先生吗?
recently won the Slater award for medicine?

153
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,367
正是
I am.

154
00:11:13,122 --> 00:11:14,686
请坦率地回答我的问题
Then answer me frankly sir,

155
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:16,876
你会看到这样做对你是有好处的
and you'll find it in your interest to do so.

156
00:11:17,606 --> 00:11:19,796
要不是你现在的财务困难
Despite your present financial situation,

157
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:21,673
你的才学一定
you clearly have all the cleverness

158
00:11:21,673 --> 00:11:23,237
会让你青云直上的
that makes a successful man.

159
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,219
但你够圆滑机智吗?
But have you the tact?

160
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:28,138
我相信我会尽力而为的
I trust that I have my share, sir.

161
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,225
有无不良嗜好?
Any bad habits?

162
00:11:30,746 --> 00:11:32,518
不酗酒吗?
Not drawn toward drink?

163
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,874
不 先生!
Now really sir.

164
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:37,420
很好 很好
Quite right, quite right.

165
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,824
不过我必须问一下
But I was bound to ask.

166
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:46,284
为什么呢?
Why?

167
00:11:46,493 --> 00:11:47,640
为什么啊?
Why sir?

168
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,664
你既然有这些本事
Simply why with all these qualities

169
00:11:50,665 --> 00:11:52,229
为什么不开业行医呢?
are you not in practice?

170
00:11:53,168 --> 00:11:55,358
现在知道了英雄
Come now it's that old story more in the brains

171
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,609
为什么也要为五斗米折腰了吧?
than in the pocket hey?

172
00:11:57,548 --> 00:11:59,320
要是我帮你在布鲁克街开业
Now sir what would say sir

173
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,822
你的意见如何?
if I were to start you in Brook Street?

174
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,369
专业人士要想成功必须志向高远
If a specialist is to succeed he must aim high

175
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:08,184
在布鲁克街行医只是个开始
and a practice in Brook Street is just the beginning.

176
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:11,521
留意了 要穿着光鲜
Capital, keep yourself in style,

177
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,129
租个像样的马车
the hire of respectable carriage and horse,

178
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:18,717
最好的手术室 候诊室和仆役
surgery that's worthy of you, waiting room, servants

179
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:22,054
还有外面能买到的最好的设备
and the best equipment that money can buy.

180
00:12:23,723 --> 00:12:26,225
这些是你将会拥有的
That is what you will have sir.

181
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,218
但是为什么啊?
But why?

182
00:12:38,428 --> 00:12:41,139
这正像别的投机事业一样
It's just like any other investment,

183
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,703
不过比较更保险一些
safer than most.

184
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:46,249
那么 我该做些什么事呢?
And what am I to do?

185
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,500
我自然会告诉你的
I'll tell you.

186
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:50,316
我要替你租房子 置家具
I will take the house, furnish it,

187
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,401
雇女仆 管理一切
pay the maids and run the whole place.

188
00:12:52,715 --> 00:12:54,905
你所要做的就是安安分分地
All you have to do is to wear out the chair

189
00:12:54,905 --> 00:12:56,469
坐在你的诊室里
in your consulting room.

190
00:12:57,303 --> 00:12:59,388
你所赚的
Then you hand over to me

191
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:01,787
我要占四分之三
three quarters of everything you earn

192
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:04,811
剩下的四分之一你自己留着
and keep one quarter for yourself.

193
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,462
你觉得这个提议怎样呢?
Now what do you say to that sir?

194
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:13,571
你同意吗?
Do you agree?

195
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:18,160
福尔摩斯先生 这就是那个
This then Mr. Holmes was the strange proposal

196
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,246
叫布莱星顿的陌生人给我提的奇怪建议
with which Mr. Blessington approached me.

197
00:13:24,835 --> 00:13:26,399
我不再叙述我们怎样
I will not weary you with how we

198
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,276
协商 成交的事
bargained and negotiated.

199
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:32,030
结果是 我在报喜节
But it ended with my moving into the house next quarter

200
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:35,158
搬进了这个寓所 并按他所提出的条件
and starting in practice on very much the same conditions

201
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,723
开始营业
as he had suggested.

202
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,727
这就是候诊室
Waiting room for your patients.

203
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:30,952
你的诊室
Your consulting room.

204
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,669
难以置信啊 布莱星顿先生
I can't believe it Mr. Blessington,

205
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:42,214
叫我怎么感谢你呢
nor can I thank you enough.

206
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,178
他把一楼最好的两间房改成了
He turned the two best rooms on the first floor

207
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,368
起居室和他自己的卧室
into a sitting room and a bedroom for himself

208
00:14:49,202 --> 00:14:51,809
然后以住院病人的身份
and came to live with me in the character of

209
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:53,790
和我住在了一起
a resident patient.

210
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:57,754
他的心脏衰弱 但算不上不正常
His heart was weak but not abnormal.

211
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,673
显然 他需要经常治疗
And yet he demanded constant medical supervision.

212
00:15:04,115 --> 00:15:07,556
他脾气古怪 闭门谢客
He was a man of singular habits, shunning company

213
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:11,727
深居简出 不过有一件事除外
and very seldom going out except in one respect.

214
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:15,899
在每天晚上的同一时刻 他都会
Every evening at the same time he would go for a walk

215
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,340
外出散步半小时 风雨不改
for half an hour exactly no matter what the weather.

216
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:24,033
而且每晚同一时刻
And every evening at the same hour

217
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,223
他都会踱进我的诊室
he would walk into the consulting room.

218
00:15:26,224 --> 00:15:27,892
检查账目
He would then examine the books,

219
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:30,603
赚的诊费 每1畿尼他给我留5先令3便士
put down five crumpets for every guinea I had earned

220
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:33,002
其余的他全部拿走
and then carried the rest off to the strong box

221
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,357
放到他自己屋内的保险箱里
in his own room.

222
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:43,326
我可以非常自信地说
I may say with confidence Mr. Holmes

223
00:15:43,848 --> 00:15:46,559
对这项投机生意 他永远也不会后悔
that he never had occasion to regret his speculation.

224
00:15:46,976 --> 00:15:49,061
一开始 生意就很成功
From the first it was a success

225
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:52,504
近两年来 我使他变成了一个富翁
and during the last two years I have made him a rich man.

226
00:15:53,546 --> 00:15:54,693
就是这些了 福尔摩斯先生
So much Mr. Holmes,

227
00:15:54,694 --> 00:15:57,196
我过去的经历以及
for my past history and my relations

228
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,386
和布莱星顿先生的关系
with the resident patient Mr. Blessington.

229
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:01,785
我要告诉你的 现在只剩下一个问题
It only remains for me now to tell you

230
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,766
就是我今晚来此求教的原因
what has occurred to bring me here tonight.

231
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,833
几星期之前 布莱星顿先生下楼来找我
Some weeks ago Mr. Blessington came down to me

232
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,441
我似乎觉得
in as it seemed to me

233
00:16:10,441 --> 00:16:13,152
他的心情异常激动      特里维廉医生
a considerable state of agitation.        Dr. Travelian,

234
00:16:13,361 --> 00:16:16,176
特里维廉医生 特里维廉医生
Dr. Travelian, Dr. Travelian,

235
00:16:16,385 --> 00:16:18,575
特里维廉医生 特里维廉医生
Dr. Travelian, Dr. Travelian,

236
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:21,390
特里维廉医生 特里维廉医生
Dr. Travelian, Dr. Travelian sir.

237
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:23,268
布莱星顿先生 冷静下
Mr. Blessington calm yourself sir.

238
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:25,666
冷静 你叫我怎么冷静?
Calm myself? Calm myself?

239
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:28,587
你没有听说那件盗窃案吗?
But my dear sir have you not heard of the burglary?

240
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,881
盗窃案?
Burglary?

241
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:32,549
哪里啊?
Where?

242
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:34,634
不 不 不 不是这里 先生
No, no, no not here sir,

243
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:37,137
不是这里 但是可能会的
not here, but it could have been.

244
00:16:40,475 --> 00:16:43,082
可能会的...
Could have been...

245
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,131
一周之内整栋房子
Within a week the whole house had become

246
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,155
的门窗都被加固闩牢
a fortress of bolts and bars and locks.

247
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:54,345
你确定这些栅栏足够坚固吗?
Are you sure these bars are strong enough?

248
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,056
它们坚固得用在英格兰银行都绰绰有余了
They'd be strong enough for the bank of England, sir.

249
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,099
布莱星顿先生?
Mr. Blessington?

250
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,019
当我向他问到这件事时
When I questioned him upon the point

251
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,105
他变得非常无礼 于是我
he became so offensive that I was compelled

252
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,565
就不再谈这件事了
to drop the subject.

253
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,006
刚开始我还以为他
At first Mr. Holmes I thought he merely sought

254
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,362
只是想保护他的保险箱
to protect his strong box,

255
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,116
但后来我发觉
but then I suspected that it was his life

256
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,264
他是在保护自己的性命
he was protecting.

257
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,477
从那之后他就完全不外出了
From then on he stopped going out all together,

258
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,980
不停地从窗户往外看
peered continually out of his windows

259
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:24,379
把自己锁在房间里
and kept himself locked in his room in what

260
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:30,219
我只能说他已经到了极度焦虑的状态
I could only describe as a state of mortal dread.

261
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:04,529
特里维廉医生 在你继续之前
Dr. Travelian, before you continue,

262
00:18:06,094 --> 00:18:08,492
你说你发现布莱星顿先生
you say you found this man Blessington

263
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,786
终日卧床 手抓报纸 并且日渐虚弱?
prostrate on his bed clutching a newspaper?

264
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:14,854
准确点说是
More precisely the remains of a newspaper

265
00:18:15,584 --> 00:18:17,565
他撕下的报纸条
for he had torn it to shreds.

266
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,693
撕成报纸条
Torn to shreds.

267
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:27,680
你还记得报纸上的内容吗?
Do you recall the contents of this newspaper at all?

268
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,497
不记得了 但我发现了些新的情况
No, I'm afraid not even if I'd known what I was looking for.

269
00:18:30,497 --> 00:18:31,852
什么时候呢?
When was this?

270
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:32,790
几周之前
It was some weeks ago,

271
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,459
好像是五月初
the beginning of May I think.

272
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,545
时间一天天过去
Gradually as time passed 

273
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,526
他的恐惧似乎逐渐消失了
his fears appeared to die away

274
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:40,821
他又恢复了常态
and he renewed his former habits.

275
00:18:41,134 --> 00:18:42,802
晚安 特里维廉医生
Good evening Dr. Travelian.

276
00:18:42,802 --> 00:18:44,783
外面天气多好啊
Wonderful evening outside.

277
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,287
我又开始出去散步了
I'm beginning to enjoy my walks again.

278
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:53,439
然后突如其来地一件事
And then suddenly a fresh event reduced him

279
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,317
让他就此卧床不起
to the pitiable state of prostration

280
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,881
知道现在
in which he now lies.

281
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,470
事情是这样的 昨天我收到一封信
What happened was yesterday I received this letter

282
00:19:01,782 --> 00:19:04,284
一位侨居在英国的俄罗斯贵族寄来的
from a Russian nobleman now resident in England

283
00:19:04,494 --> 00:19:06,162
他深受强直性昏厥病的折磨
who suffers from catalepsy.

284
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,457
他在信中写道亟愿到我处就医
In it he announces his intention of visiting me

285
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:10,125
准备明晚六点一刻左右
for a consultation this very evening

286
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,585
前往就诊
at a quarter past six.

287
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,824
由于对强直症进行研究的主要困难
Because of the chief difficulty in the study of catalepsy

288
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,492
在于这种疾病是罕见的
and the rareness of the disease

289
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:25,037
你可以相信 在约定时间那时
you may believe that at the appointed hour

290
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,332
我已经心焦地等候在我的诊室里
I was eager to receive the patient.

291
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,418
晚上好啊 先生
Good evening gentlemen.

292
00:19:30,148 --> 00:19:32,650
我是特里维廉医生 我想
I'm Dr. Travelian and it was you sir

293
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:34,319
就是阁下给我写的信吧?
I assume who wrote to me?

294
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:39,116
医生 我的父亲很少说英语的
My father speaks very little English doctor,

295
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,184
所以希望你不介意我陪他进来
so I trust you will excuse my coming in with him

296
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:44,644
他的健康问题
as his health is a matter

297
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:47,876
对我是极重要的事情
of the most overwhelming importance to me.

298
00:19:47,877 --> 00:19:49,337
是的 这个我清楚 先生
Yes, I respect that sir.

299
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:50,379
芬顿
Fenton,

300
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:55,176
或许在诊治时 你愿意留在诊室里吧?
perhaps you would like to join us for the consultation?

301
00:19:55,177 --> 00:19:57,888
不行 绝对不行
Nyet, nyet, not for all of the world.

302
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:01,538
我受不了这种痛苦
It is more painful to me than I can express.

303
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:03,936
如果我看到我父亲
If I were to see my father in one of those

304
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:06,127
疾病发作时那种可怕的样子
dreadful seizures I am convinced

305
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,212
我相信我是忍受不了的
I would never survive it.

306
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,672
我自己的神经官能
My own nervous system

307
00:20:09,673 --> 00:20:12,905
也十分敏感

我最初的感觉是既怜悯又害怕

哪一方面都没有发现与我以前所诊断的

烷基亚硝酸吸入剂 取得了良好的疗效

343
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,974
现在似乎正是试验
and the present seemed an admirable opportunity

00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,150
嗯 一眼看上去
Well at first glance they do appear

381

00:25:54,024 --> 00:25:55,379
布莱星顿先生?
Mr. Blessington?

390
00:25:57,987 --> 00:25:59,342

你给我出去 我要单独呆会 出去

一个什么都不偷的贼
A thief that doesn't steal.

399
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,818
他有指名道姓说要我帮忙吗?

400
00:26:33,653 --> 00:26:34,800
噢 是的

另外两位先生

00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:18,704

我相信我是到了迫不得已的地步

424
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,191
没人比我更需要你的建议了 先生
No one has ever needed your advice more than I, no one.

425
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:05,216
我相信特里维廉医生已经告诉你
I expect Dr. Travelian has told you

426
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,927
有人不经允许闯进我的房间这件事了
of this unwarrantable intrusion into my rooms.

427
00:28:07,928 --> 00:28:09,075
布莱星顿先生
My sir, Mr. Blessington,

428
00:28:09,075 --> 00:28:10,847
那两个男人是谁呢?

429
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:13,975
哪两个男人啊 我不认识他们
Which two men, I don't know them.

430
00:28:14,289 --> 00:28:16,374
那他们为什么要打扰你呢?
Then why do they wish to molest you?

431
00:28:16,792 --> 00:28:18,043
打扰我?
Molest me?

432
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:21,589
你可不能指望我来回答这个问题
You could hardly expect me to answer that.

433
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:23,153
你是说你不知道?
You mean that you don't know?

434
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,281
请进
Come in here, please.

435
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:31,287
请进来吧!
Just have the kindness to step in here!

436
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,911
我从来就不是个富人 福尔摩斯先生
I've never been a rich man, Mr. Holmes.

437
00:28:48,912 --> 00:28:51,310
我一生只做过一次投资
I've never made but one investment in my life,

438
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,978
特里维廉医生会告诉你
Dr. Travelian will tell you that

439
00:28:53,709 --> 00:28:56,003
我有多么不相信银行家的
but I don't believe in bankers sir.

440
00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:58,089
绝对不要相信银行家
Never trust a banker

441
00:28:58,089 --> 00:28:59,757
福尔摩斯先生 绝不!
Mr. Holmes, never.

442
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:02,156
这是我们之间的秘密
It's between ourselves.

443
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,806
我全部身家都在这保险箱里
What little I have is here in this strong box.

444
00:29:06,015 --> 00:29:07,683
现在你知道
So you can understand what it means to me

445
00:29:07,683 --> 00:29:08,621
陌生人
when unknown people

446
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,499
潜进我的房间这件事对我有多重要了吧
force themselves into my rooms.

447
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:20,510
布莱星顿先生 要是你一定要蒙骗我的话
Mr. Blessington I cannot possibly advise you

448
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,282
我是没法帮助你的
if you try to deceive me.

449
00:29:22,492 --> 00:29:23,847
蒙骗你?
Deceive you?

450
00:29:23,952 --> 00:29:25,620
我已经告诉你一切了
But I've told you everything.

451
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,270
晚安 特里维廉医生
Good night Dr. Travelian.

452
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,337
福尔摩斯先生 你不给我一些指教吗?
Mr. Holmes, no advice for me?

453
00:29:33,338 --> 00:29:36,153
我对你的指教就是请讲真话
My advice to you is to speak the truth.

454
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:45,434
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

455
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,721
马车!
Cab!

456
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:05,561
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

457
00:30:05,562 --> 00:30:07,126
我能从那人的眼睛中看出
I can read in a man's eyes

458
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,420
他只是害怕自己的幻想
when it's his own skin that he's frightened of.

459
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:10,881
是的 但你为什么说他说谎呢?
Yes, But why did you call him a liar?

460
00:30:10,881 --> 00:30:14,531
因为我知道他认识那两个人
Because I am certain that he does know who these men are.

461
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:15,678
马车!
Cab!

462
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:21,726
一位俄罗斯年轻人
A young Russian

463
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:23,707
潜进布莱星顿先生的房间
penetrated to Blessington's rooms

464
00:30:23,708 --> 00:30:26,106
他的同谋就引开医生的注意力
while his confederate kept the doctor from interfering.

465
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:29,130
强直性昏厥病是很好模仿的
And of course catalepsy is a very easy complaint to imitate.

466
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:30,799
是的 我知道 我自己也做过
Yes, I know I've done it myself.

467
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:32,572
福尔摩斯?
Holmes?

468
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,075
会不会有这么一个可能性
Might there be one alternative,

469
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:38,307
十分荒诞但同时也是可信的
grotesquely improbably no doubt but still just conceivable,

470
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:42,062
整个故事就是患了强直性昏厥的人
might the whole story of the cataleptic Russian

471
00:30:42,062 --> 00:30:44,356
和那个儿子都是特里维廉医生编出来的
and son be a concoction of Dr. Travelian

472
00:30:44,565 --> 00:30:47,276
他自己居心不良闯进布莱星顿先生的房间
who for his own purposes has been in Blessington's room?

473
00:30:47,276 --> 00:30:49,883
但你看到楼梯上地毯上的脚印了吗?
But did you see the footprints on the stair carpet?

474
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:53,428
那鞋印是方头的 而布莱星顿先生的
They were square toed, quite unlike Blessington's

475
00:30:53,429 --> 00:30:56,036
鞋子是圆头的 同时又比特里维廉医生的
which are round and an inch and a third longer

476
00:30:56,036 --> 00:30:57,391
长了1.3寸
than Dr. Travelians.

477
00:30:57,392 --> 00:30:59,999
我觉得我们今晚要好好想下
I think we can sleep on this Watson

478
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:02,502
不出所料的话
but I should be surprised if we do not hear

479
00:31:02,502 --> 00:31:04,170
他们明早就会来找我们的
from Brook Street in the morning.

480
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:06,047
晚安
Good night.

481
00:31:06,882 --> 00:31:08,133
晚安 老朋友
Night old fellow.

482
00:31:20,231 --> 00:31:21,691
早啊 医生
Morning doctor.

483
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,255
你的茶放门外了
Your tea is here.

484
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:25,132
谢谢 诺拉
Thank you Nora.

485
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:55,062
布莱星顿先生 你的茶
Mr. Blessington, your breakfast tea.

486
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:00,589
布莱星顿先生?
Mr. Blessington?

487
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,046
华生...
Watson...

488
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:39,800
赶快穿衣服
get dressed quickly.

489
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,678
马车在等我们了
There's a cab waiting for us.

490
00:32:41,782 --> 00:32:42,616
为什么啊?
Why?

491
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:43,658
什么事啊?
What's the matter?

492
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,640
布鲁克街那件事
The Brook Street business.

493
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,205
有什么新消息吗?
Any fresh news?

494
00:32:51,481 --> 00:32:52,732
看在上帝的面上
For God's sake,

495
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:55,547
立即前来 珀西・特里维廉
come at once, P. Travelian.

496
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:00,762
噢 福尔摩斯先生 很高兴你能来
Oh, Mr. Holmes I'm so glad you could come.

497
00:33:00,762 --> 00:33:02,117
发生什么事了?
What has happened?

498
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:04,099
布莱星顿先生自杀了
Mr. Blessington has committed suicide.

499
00:33:04,099 --> 00:33:05,141
自杀?
Suicide?

500
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:06,080
是的
Yes.

501
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:08,166
他在夜里上吊了
He hung himself during the night.

502
00:33:17,135 --> 00:33:18,699
有人碰过尸体吗?
Has the body been touched?

503
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:19,637
没有
No.

504
00:33:21,828 --> 00:33:23,079
听差呢?
Where's the page?

505
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:24,956
找不到
Nowhere to be found.

506
00:33:46,439 --> 00:33:47,899
早上好啊 巡官
Good morning inspector.

507
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:49,880
福尔摩斯先生 很高兴见到你
Mr. Holmes, delighted to see you.

508
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,488
现在请你看下
Now please take a look.

509
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,365
我们正准备把他放下来
We were just about to take him down.

510
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,951
是的 巡官
Right, inspector.

511
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,203
担架
Stretcher.

512
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,299
就这样了
That'll be all.

513
00:34:47,655 --> 00:34:50,262
你听说过案子发生前的一些情况了吗?
Have heard of the events leading up to this affair?

514
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,078
是的 特里维廉医生已经跟我说过一些了
Yes, Dr. Travelian has told me something of them.

515
00:34:53,078 --> 00:34:54,433
你有什么意见吗?
And have you formed an opinion?

516
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,206
目前就我所知 他
Now as far as I can see, the man was driven

517
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:58,397
应该是被吓疯了
out of his senses by fright.

518
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:00,899
在这张床上他睡了好一阵子
The bed has been well slept in.

519
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,402
有很深的压痕
There was his impression deep enough for all to see.

520
00:35:03,924 --> 00:35:05,592
你也知道 自杀常常发生
It is about 5:00 in the morning.

521
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:07,677
在早晨五点钟左右
You know that suicides are most common.

522
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:10,389
这大约也就是他上吊的时间了
That would be about the time that he hanged himself.

523
00:35:11,015 --> 00:35:13,413
看来 他是经过再三考虑才这样做的
It seems to be a very deliberate affair.

524
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,708
根据肌肉僵硬的情况判断
Yes, from the rigidity of the limbs

525
00:35:15,708 --> 00:35:17,793
我看他已经死了大约三个小时
I'd say he'd been dead about three hours.

526
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:18,941
谢谢华生.
Thank you Watson.

527
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,652
你注意到屋子里有什么异常现象吗?
Notice anything peculiar about the room.

528
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:22,799
在洗手池上发现
There was a screwdriver on the mantel piece

529
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,947
一把螺丝起子和一些螺丝钉
There was a screwdriver on the mantel piece

530
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:27,388
还发现他夜里似乎抽过不少烟
and he seems to have smoked heavily during the night.

531
00:35:27,388 --> 00:35:29,265
这是我在壁炉里找到的
I found these in the fireplace.

532
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:38,233
你找到他的雪茄烟嘴了吗?
Have you his cigar holder?

533
00:35:38,547 --> 00:35:40,111
没有 我没有看到
No, I haven't seen one.

534
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,073
那么 他的烟盒呢?
His cigar case then?

535
00:35:44,178 --> 00:35:46,472
有 在他的外衣口袋里
Yes, it was in his coat pocket.

536
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:56,900
这是一支哈瓦那烟
This is savannah,

537
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:02,428
而壁炉台上的这些是特殊品种
And these others are the cigars of a peculiar sort

538
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,679
是荷兰从
which is imported by the Dutch

539
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,661
它的东印度殖民地进口的
from the East Indian colonies.

540
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:09,415
这些雪茄通常都包着稻草
They're usually wrapped in straw you know and are thinner

541
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:11,292
并且比别的牌子的都细
for their length than any other brand.

542
00:36:11,814 --> 00:36:13,378
我相信你没有读过
I don't suppose you've read monograph

543
00:36:13,378 --> 00:36:15,150
雪茄和抽雪茄这个行为的论文
on cigars and cigar action?

544
00:36:15,151 --> 00:36:16,715
我 嗯...
Well I, um...

545
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:18,487
没有 当然没有 谢谢
No, of course not. Thank you.

546
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:25,996
这些是用烟嘴抽的 而这些不是
These have been smoked with a holder and these without.

547
00:36:28,083 --> 00:36:31,211
这些是用一把较钝的小刀削过的
These have been cut by a not very sharp knife

548
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,401
另两个烟头是
and these have had their ends bitten off

549
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:37,885
用尖锐的牙齿咬下来的
by a set of very excellent teeth.

550
00:36:42,474 --> 00:36:46,332
昨晚这里有三个人
There were three men here last night.

551
00:36:47,063 --> 00:36:51,443
老天啊 可是什么都没有被盗
Good heavens but nothing was stolen

552
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:53,007
他们究竟在干吗?
so what were they doing here?

553
00:36:53,737 --> 00:36:56,344
这是我们要找出的
That is what we have to find out.

554
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:57,907
他们怎么进来的?
How did they get in?

555
00:36:57,908 --> 00:37:00,306
像我们一样从前门进来的
The same way we did through the front door.

556
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:02,288
早晨门是上锁的
But the door was barred in the morning.

557
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,478
那么门是在他们走后锁上的
Then it was barred after they left.

558
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,981
你怎么知道呢?
Well how do you know that?

559
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,962
我看到了他们留下的痕迹
I saw their traces.

560
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:11,047
请稍等一等
If you would just give me a few moments Inspector,

561
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:13,759
我就能给你们进一步说明它的情况
I may be able to give you some further information.

562
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,605
不要动 华生
Don't move Watson.

563
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:05,831
事实很简单
The actual facts are very simple.

564
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,395
如无意外下午
And I shall be surprised if by the afternoon

565
00:40:07,396 --> 00:40:10,837
我就能给你和他们一个交代
I cannot give you the reasons for them as well.

566
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:13,235
但是 福尔摩斯 你现在不能说吗?
But Holmes, can't you tell us anything now?

567
00:40:16,051 --> 00:40:20,535
噢 事情的次序可是不能颠倒的
Oh, there is no doubt as to the sequence of events.

568
00:40:20,536 --> 00:40:21,787
有三个人
The three of them in it.

569
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,393
一个年轻人 一个老人
A young man, an old man

570
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:28,669
还有另外一个人身份不明
and a third to whose identity I have no clue.

571
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:33,989
头两个不用想就知道
The first two I need hardly remark are the same 

572
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:37,117
是假扮成俄罗斯父子的那两个
who masqueraded as the Russian Count and his son.

573
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,203
因此我们很清楚他们的特征
So we can give a very good description of them,

574
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:40,871
是吧 特里维廉医生
can we not Dr. Travelian?

575
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,061
他们是被这所房子里的
They were admitted by a confederate

576
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:45,564
一个同伙放进来的
inside the house.

577
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:52,030
他们进到大厅
They entered the hall.

578
00:40:53,281 --> 00:40:57,348
首先是老人 然后是年轻人
The older man first, the younger man second

579
00:40:57,661 --> 00:40:59,538
神秘人在后面
and the unknown man in the rear.

580
00:41:03,293 --> 00:41:05,587
他们上楼梯
They ascended the stairs.

581
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,432
他们用一根铁丝去转动里面的钥匙
With the help of a wire they forced the key.

582
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:19,457
你们甚至不用放大镜 也可以从
Even without the lens you can see where

583
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:21,334
这把钥匙榫槽上的划痕看出
the pressure has been applied.

584
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,174
他们进入室内 第一步
On entering the room the first proceeding

585
00:41:27,174 --> 00:41:31,032
一定是把布莱星顿先生的嘴给塞住
must have been to gag Mr. Blessington.

586
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:41,148
很明显 他们把他安置妥当以后
Having secured Blessington it is evident to me

587
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:45,111
就商量了一番
that a consultation of some sort was held

588
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:49,178
这种商量可能具有起诉的性质
probably in the nature of a judicial proceeding.

589
00:41:49,804 --> 00:41:51,472
它一定进行了相当一段时间
It must have lasted for some time

590
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:52,307
因为正是在这段时间
for it was then

591
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,454
他们吸了这几支雪茄
that the cigars were smoked.

592
00:41:53,454 --> 00:41:56,061
老人坐在那张
It was there that the older man sat

593
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,251
柳条椅子上
in the wicker chair.

594
00:41:58,669 --> 00:42:00,859
是他用的雪茄烟嘴
It was he who used the cigar holder.

595
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,778
年轻人坐那里
The younger man sat there.

596
00:42:03,883 --> 00:42:06,490
他把烟灰磕在了衣柜的对面
He knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers.

597
00:42:06,907 --> 00:42:10,557
第三个人在室内踱来踱去
The unknown fellow paced up and down.

598
00:42:10,974 --> 00:42:13,685
我想 这时布莱星顿正笔直地坐在床上
Blessington I think sat upright in the bed,

599
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:15,771
不过对这一点我还不能绝对肯定
but of that I cannot be absolutely certain.

600
00:42:16,919 --> 00:42:21,403
最后 他们就去抓布莱星顿...
It ended of course by them taking Blessington...

601
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,526
这是他们早就安排好了的
Now this matter was so prearranged

602
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,611
因为我相信他们随身带来了
that it is my belief that they brought with them

603
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,574
某种滑轮用作绞刑架
some sort of block or pulley to serve as a gallows.

604
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:41,182
噢 是的 绞刑架 巡官
Oh, yes as gallows Inspector.

605
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:44,519
这是种报仇的仪式
This was a revenge ritual.

606
00:43:45,145 --> 00:43:49,316
这故事多精彩啊
Well an extraordinary story.

607
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:51,818
但有什么证据呢?
But what proof?

608
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:56,615
天黑之前我会给你证据的
I'll have it before the day is out.

609
00:43:57,242 --> 00:43:58,180
你还没解释
You haven't explained about

610
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,431
螺丝起子和螺丝的用处呢
the screws and the screwdriver.

611
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:01,622
那是用来固定滑轮组或者滑轮的
Oh, that was to fix up the block or pulley.

612
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,186
但他们看到吊灯钩的时候
But when they saw the chandelier hook

613
00:44:03,186 --> 00:44:05,063
很自然地他们就就地取材
they naturally saved themselves the trouble.

614
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:08,608
如果我可以向你进一句忠言的话 警长
No Inspector I suggest that you immediately make inquiries

615
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:11,320
那就应当逮捕那个小听差
about the page and arrest him.

616
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,571
这是肯定的 福尔摩斯先生
Certainly Mr. Holmes.

617
00:44:12,572 --> 00:44:15,700
我在三点钟之前回来
I will be back here a little before 3:00.

618
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:17,994
再见
Good day.

619
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:43,857
我想哈德森夫人看到这个的话
I daresay Mrs. Hudson will be a little put out

620
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:45,630
肯定会很不开心
when she sees all this.

621
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,280
你在找什么?
What are you looking for?

622
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,365
沃辛顿 W
Worthington, W,

623
00:44:51,366 --> 00:44:55,120
沃辛顿 三月 1880 我确定
Worthingon, March 1880 I'm sure.

624
00:44:55,642 --> 00:44:57,102
三月 80
March '80,

625
00:45:02,316 --> 00:45:03,463
80
'80,

626
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:08,677
一月

627
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,241
二月
February,

628
00:45:11,806 --> 00:45:12,848
三月
March.

629
00:45:15,873 --> 00:45:17,020
是这个吗?
Any good?

630
00:45:18,793 --> 00:45:20,044
华生...
Watson...

631
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:27,761
布莱星顿 或者说 那时候的萨顿
Blessington or Sutton as he was known then.

632
00:45:30,995 --> 00:45:32,350
哈德森夫人
Mrs. Hudson.

633
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:36,626
你的小船很快就来了 医生
Your little boat is coming along beautifully Doctor.

634
00:45:36,626 --> 00:45:38,816
噢 谢谢啊 哈德森夫人
Oh, thank you Mrs. Hudson.

635
00:45:38,816 --> 00:45:41,006
我要走了
I must run.

636
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,654
啊 谢谢
Ah, thank you.

637
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:04,783
特里维廉医生
Dr. Travelian.

638
00:46:04,783 --> 00:46:05,825
有什么消息吗 警官?
Any news Inspector?

639
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:07,286
是的 先生 我们在
Yes, sir we've got the page

640
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,850
两条街外找到听差在喝酒
drinking his earnings two streets away.

641
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:11,353
我抓到他们了      你抓到他们啦?
But I got the man.        You've got them?

642
00:46:11,353 --> 00:46:13,230
至少我知道他们的身份了
Or at least I've got their identity.

643
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:16,151
抢劫沃辛顿银行的那一伙?
The Worthington Bank Gang?

644
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:17,193
的确
Precisely.

645
00:46:17,923 --> 00:46:19,800
那布莱星顿肯定就是萨顿了
Well then Blessington must have been Sutton.

646
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:20,739
正确
Exactly.

647
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,824
那现在就水落石出了
Well that makes it clear as crystal.

648
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:24,285
我还不懂呢
not to me I'm afraid.

649
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:25,849
华生医生 你 呃...
Dr. Watson would you, uh...

650
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,309
你应该听说过
You may have heard of the great

651
00:46:27,309 --> 00:46:29,290
沃辛顿银行劫案吧?
Worthington bank affair?

652
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,751
一共有5个人
There were five men in it.

653
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:32,836
三个昨晚出现在这里
The three who were in this room,

654
00:46:32,836 --> 00:46:37,111
还有两个叫卡特莱特和布莱星顿
a fourth named Cartwright and Blessington.

655
00:46:43,265 --> 00:46:45,246
是的 我们走吧
Alright, let's be gone.

656
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,109
这可是要被判死刑的
It's a hanging job now.

657
00:47:13,716 --> 00:47:16,427
没人知道就不是啦
Only if someone squeals.

658
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:24,770
就是他了
That's him.

659
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:26,543
你确定?
Are you positive?

660
00:47:29,255 --> 00:47:32,175
是的 就是他了
Oh, yes, that's him.

661
00:47:34,782 --> 00:47:41,352
萨顿 萨顿 你死定了 死定了 死定了
Sutton, Sutton, you're dead, dead, dead.

662
00:47:43,855 --> 00:47:45,836
萨顿 你死定了
Sutton, you're dead.

663
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:47,192
萨顿...
Sutton...

664
00:47:47,192 --> 00:47:50,529
不用担心 萨顿先生 他会被判死刑的
Don't worry Mr. Sutton, it's a hanging job now.

665
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,430
萨顿 你听着
Sutton, you hear.

666
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:57,725
萨顿 或者说 布莱星顿
Sutton or Blessington

667
00:47:57,725 --> 00:48:00,436
成了污点证人
who was the worst of the gang turned informer.

668
00:48:00,645 --> 00:48:03,669
由于他的证词 卡特莱特被绞死
On his evidence Cartright was hanged

669
00:48:04,086 --> 00:48:07,527
另外三个人被判入狱15年
and the other three got 15 years apiece.

670
00:48:09,509 --> 00:48:11,386
比德尔 海沃德和莫法特
Bibel, Haywood and Moffit

671
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:13,576
几周之前出狱了
were released from prison just a few weeks ago

672
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:16,183
他们被提前释放
which was several years before their full term.

673
00:48:16,705 --> 00:48:19,207
他们出来的消息让布莱星顿
It was news of their release which caused Blessington

674
00:48:19,208 --> 00:48:21,189
惊慌不已 他加固了房子
to panic and have this house secured.

675
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:23,483
这么说他害怕的不是盗窃案?
So it was not the fear burglary that had frightened him?

676
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,986
不 不 那只是个烟雾弹
No, no, that was a mere blind.

677
00:48:27,342 --> 00:48:28,906
那么在我身上投资
And so setting me up in practice

678
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:32,034
也是想巧妙地保护他自己?
was an elaborate charade to protect himself.

679
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:39,022
可是他为什么不把这件事告诉你呢?
Well why could he not tell you this?

680
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:41,420
他在尽量
He was trying to hide his own identity

681
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,611
向所有人隐瞒自己的身份
from everybody for as long as he could.

682
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:45,279
他的秘密是可耻的
His secret was shameful

683
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,782
他不可能自己泄漏出来
and he couldn't bring himself to divulge it.

684
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:51,431
但是 他虽然卑鄙
However, wretch as he was

685
00:48:51,432 --> 00:48:53,934
却依然处于英国法律的保护之下
he was still living under the shield of British law.

686
00:48:54,248 --> 00:48:55,603
警长 我毫不怀疑
And I have no doubt Inspector

687
00:48:55,604 --> 00:48:57,272
你可以看到
that we shall see

688
00:48:57,272 --> 00:48:59,774
尽管那个盾没有起到保护作用
that though that shield may fail to guard,

689
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:04,155
那把正义的剑还是会替他复仇的
the sword of justice is still there to avenge.

690
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:07,596
尽管夏洛克・福尔摩斯十分努力
In spite of the efforts of Sherlock Holmes

691
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:09,264
那三个杀害布莱星顿的凶手
the three murderers of Blessington

692
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:11,559
骗过了警方 离开了这个国家
eluded the police and fled the country

693
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:13,540
上了一艘去葡萄牙的船
aboard a ship bound for Portugal.

694
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,835
几周之后我们得悉
It was a few weeks later that we learned

695
00:49:15,835 --> 00:49:17,920
那艘"诺拉克列依那"号
that the ship, the Nora Crainer

696
00:49:18,025 --> 00:49:22,092
和全体船员数年以前在葡萄牙海岸
had sunk with all hands upon the Portuguese Coast

697
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:24,803
距波尔图以北数十哩的地方遇难
some leagues to the north of a porter.

698
00:49:56,507 --> 00:49:57,758
福尔摩斯
Holmes.

699
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,720
什么事?
What's wrong?

700
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:05,683
嗯 我正准备用一天时间写下
Well it's just that I was going to spend the day writing

701
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:07,456
特里维廉医生的那宗案件
the case of Dr. Travelian

702
00:50:07,457 --> 00:50:09,855
趁这一切我都还记得
while the facts are still fresh.

703
00:50:09,855 --> 00:50:13,505
哦 你是说... 哦 我明白了
Oh, you mean... oh, I understand.

704
00:50:16,008 --> 00:50:17,676
太谢谢了
Thanks awfully.

705
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:23,307
可我现在无法集中精神写作
It's just that it is difficult to concentrate otherwise.

706
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:33,319
你说什么样的题目好呢?
What will you entitle this particular account?

707
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:39,472
我不知道你对我的作品竟还有兴趣
I didn't know you were interested in my writing.

708
00:50:39,472 --> 00:50:42,704
我一直都对你的标题的选择很感兴趣
I am always interested in your choice of titles.

709
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:46,876
我想我会用
Well I thought I would call it

710
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,232
布鲁克街疑团
the Brook Street Mystery.

711
00:50:53,864 --> 00:50:54,802
不行?
No?

712
00:50:55,532 --> 00:50:57,096
我自己的话 就会取名叫
Well I myself would prefer

713
00:50:57,097 --> 00:51:00,329
住院的病人 但是
The Resident Patient, but please

714
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:02,623
别让我影响到你的思维
do not let me influence you.

715
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,322
布鲁克街疑团很不错了
The Brook Street Mystery no doubt would suffice.

716
