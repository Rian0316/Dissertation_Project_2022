1
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,941
Sutton,

2
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,081
Sutton,

3
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:24,685
Sutton help me.

4
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,922
Help me Sutton.

5
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:36,897
Please help,

6
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,997
help,

7
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,973
help me Sutton.

8
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:51,545
Sutton help.

9
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,186
Don't let them take me Sutton.

10
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,889
Help me Sutton,

11
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,591
Sutton.

12
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:07,961
Don't let them take me Sutton.

13
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:11,064
Help me.

14
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,134
Help me Sutton.

15
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:17,938
Sutton help.

16
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:21,775
Please help,

17
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,875
help.

18
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Help me.

19
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,929
Help me Sutton.

20
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,364
Sutton,

21
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:48,168
Sutton, Sutton help,

22
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:50,268
help me.

23
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,933
Sutton,

24
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,033
Sutton.

25
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,807
Mustn't take it so badly Holmes.

26
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,510
What?

27
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,146
Well I know it's inconvenient
but you really mustn't...

28
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,348
...let it affect you like this.

29
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,684
Whatever do you mean?

30
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:14,121
You are sitting there
boiling with indignation...

31
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,457
...because you have been forced to leave...

32
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:19,393
...the warmth and comfort
of 221B by the order...

33
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:22,096
...of Mrs. Hudson's spring cleaning.

34
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:26,834
My dear Watson however
did you deduce that?

35
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:30,003
By simply applying your methods Holmes.

36
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,672
Indeed?

37
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,141
You'll agree that you are not here...

38
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,243
...for either a shave or a haircut.

39
00:04:36,343 --> 00:04:37,478
That is true.

40
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:38,946
How did you know?

41
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,081
Because you invariably shave
yourself and you are patently...

42
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,217
...not due for a haircut
for another two weeks.

43
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,317
Correct.

44
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:48,455
And you left our rooms in some haste.

45
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:54,061
You are without either
your gloves or your cane.

46
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,194
Go on.

47
00:04:56,263 --> 00:05:00,401
Well, I know that Mrs. Hudson's
been trying to complete...

48
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,170
...her spring cleaning all day.

49
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,906
Now, you have been sitting there...

50
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:09,443
...frowning,
eyes tightly closed,

51
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:11,576
grinding your teeth,

52
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,180
and all the time your fingers...

53
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,915
...have been drumming like pistons...

54
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,950
...on the arm of that chair.

55
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,254
So given all this at once
even I cannot fail to deduce...

56
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:23,757
...that you are have quarreled
with our good housekeeper...

57
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:27,127
...and sought refuge in the sanity
of the barbershop.

58
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:32,132
You cannot deny that I am right.

59
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:35,869
Oh, Watson you could not be...

60
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,572
...further from the truth.

61
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,675
I am here to get our good barber's advice...

62
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:44,678
...as to the specimen of hair
found at the scene...

63
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,681
...of a bloody misadventure
last Tuesday in Debford.

64
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,149
Oh,
come along Holmes.

65
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:51,351
You're worried about something.

66
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,620
What you perceived as agitation...

67
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,925
...was indeed most intense
tranquil enjoyment.

68
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:01,762
My eyes were closed
because I was trying to recall...

69
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,732
...as vividly as I could the concert...

70
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,634
...that we attended last night.

71
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,199
You were grinding your teeth.

72
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,539
That is because I made a slight error...

73
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,576
...in my recollection of Urkian's fingering...

74
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,345
...his cadenza in the third movement...

75
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,147
...of the Beethoven Violin Concerto...

76
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,247
...ba, ba, ba.

77
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,526
Nevertheless there is an element of truth...

78
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,294
...in what you say.

79
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,394
Ah.

80
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,383
A doctor's,

81
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:59,253
a general practitioner's I perceive,

82
00:06:59,353 --> 00:07:02,523
not been long in practice
or had much to do,

83
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,925
come to consult us I fancy.

84
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,025
Lucky we came back.

85
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,053
Ah,
Mr. Holmes.

86
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,822
Thank you Mrs. Hudson.

87
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:39,560
Doctor, this is my friend
and colleague Dr. Watson.

88
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,363
Pray resume your seat
and tell me how I may serve you.

89
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,967
Well, I am indeed a doctor
and my name is Percy Travelian...

90
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:49,737
...and I live at number 403 Brook Street.

91
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,877
Aren't you the author...

92
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,109
...of a monograph upon
obscure nervous lesions?

93
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,244
Yes, but I so seldom hear of the work

94
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:59,384
I thought it quite dead.

95
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:01,115
By no means.

96
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,050
My publishers have given me...

97
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,619
...a most discouraging account of its sales.

98
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,855
You are yourself a medical man?

99
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,790
Retired army surgeon.

100
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,260
My hobby has always been
the study of nervous disease.

101
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,095
I should of course like to make it...

102
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,331
...an absolute specialty but a man...

103
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,533
...must take what he can get first.

104
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,503
However, this is beside the question...

105
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:24,438
...and I do appreciate,
Mr. Holmes,

106
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:26,774
how very valuable your time is.

107
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,643
The fact is that a singular train of events...

108
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,279
...has occurred recently
at my house in Brook Street...

109
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,415
...and tonight they came to such a head...

110
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:37,117
...that I felt it was impossible
to wait another hour...

111
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:40,587
...before asking for your advice
and your assistance.

112
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,152
You are very welcome to both.

113
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:49,997
Let me have a detailed
account of the circumstances...

114
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,799
...which have disturbed you.

115
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,234
Well one or two of them are so trivial...

116
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,837
...that I am almost
ashamed to mention them.

117
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,972
But the matter is so inexplicable...

118
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,175
...and the recent turn
it has taken so elaborate...

119
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:03,444
...that I shall lay it all before you
and you shall judge...

120
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,046
...what is essential and what is not.

121
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:09,650
I am a London University man
and I am not unduly...

122
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,054
...singing my praises when I say
I was a very promising student.

123
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,457
And it was thought a distinguished career...

124
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,125
...lay before me.

125
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,228
However, there was
one great stumbling block.

126
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,596
Money?

127
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,932
Indeed doctor,
money.

128
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,801
I needed capital not only to practice...

129
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,870
...but also to get out of the scrawled rooms

130
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,970
I was forced to rent.

131
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,441
I could not expect my patients to trust me...

132
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,777
...if I could not afford the proper equipment.

133
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,713
Yes, I've seen it happen to too many of us.

134
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:42,316
I myself was obliged to go into the army...

135
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,951
...in order to follow my career.

136
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,152
Indeed.

137
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,921
I had thought of abandoning
my own career...

138
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,758
...except for one sudden
and unexpected incident.

139
00:09:50,858 --> 00:09:53,260
Exactly what kind of incident?

140
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,095
One morning two years ago

141
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:57,064
I received a visit from a man by the name...

142
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:03,284
...of Blessington who until that time
had been a complete stranger to me.

143
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,854
Come in.

144
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:33,333
Good heavens,
do you live here, in this?

145
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,903
Yes,
I'm afraid I do.

146
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:38,005
You are the same Percy Travelian...

147
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,474
...who's had so distinguished a career,

148
00:10:40,574 --> 00:10:43,410
recently won the Slater
award for medicine?

149
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,546
I am.

150
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,883
Then answer me frankly sir,

151
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,753
and you'll find it in your interest to do so.

152
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,322
Despite your present financial situation,

153
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,658
you clearly have all the cleverness...

154
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,626
...that makes a successful man.

155
00:10:59,726 --> 00:11:01,395
But have you the tact?

156
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:04,531
I trust that I have my share, sir.

157
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,665
Any bad habits?

158
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,469
Not drawn toward drink?

159
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,569
Now really sir.

160
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:12,611
Quite right,
quite right.

161
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,680
But I was bound to ask.

162
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,081
Why?

163
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,316
Why sir?

164
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,785
Simply why with all these qualities...

165
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,554
...are you not in practice?

166
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,656
Come now it's that old story
more in the brains...

167
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,725
...than in the pocket hey?

168
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:33,861
Now sir what would say sir...

169
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,530
...if I were to start you in Brook Street?

170
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,299
If a specialist
is to succeed he must aim high...

171
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,603
...and a practice in Brook Street
is just the beginning.

172
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:45,005
Capital,
keep yourself in style,

173
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:48,075
the hire of respectable carriage and horse,

174
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:51,645
surgery that's worthy of you,
waiting room, servants...

175
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:55,549
...and the best equipment
that money can buy.

176
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,652
That is what you will have sir.

177
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,197
But why?

178
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,390
It's just like any other investment,

179
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,569
safer than most.

180
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:18,138
And what am I to do?

181
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,907
I'll tell you.

182
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:22,509
I will take the house,
furnish it,

183
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,012
pay the maids and run the whole place.

184
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,748
All you have to do is to wear out the chair...

185
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,683
...in your consulting room.

186
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,852
Then you hand over to me...

187
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,588
...three quarters of everything you earn...

188
00:12:34,688 --> 00:12:37,391
...and keep one quarter for yourself.

189
00:12:37,491 --> 00:12:41,128
Now what do you say to that sir?

190
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,498
Do you agree?

191
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:49,503
This then Mr. Holmes
was the strange proposal...

192
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,343
...with which Mr.
Blessington approached me.

193
00:12:55,576 --> 00:12:57,644
I will not weary you with how we...

194
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,613
...bargained and negotiated.

195
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,983
But it ended with my moving
into the house next quarter...

196
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:06,019
...and starting in practice
on very much the same conditions...

197
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,119
...as he had suggested.

198
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:28,674
Waiting room for your patients.

199
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,772
Your consulting room.

200
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,913
I can't believe it Mr. Blessington,

201
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,516
nor can I thank you enough.

202
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,920
He turned the two best rooms
on the first floor...

203
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,689
...into a sitting room
and a bedroom for himself...

204
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,559
...and came to live with
me in the character of...

205
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,028
...a resident patient.

206
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:24,188
His heart was weak but not abnormal.

207
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,768
And yet he demanded
constant medical supervision.

208
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:33,307
He was a man of singular
habits, shunning company...

209
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,146
...and very seldom going out
except in one respect.

210
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,815
Every evening at the same time
he would go for a walk...

211
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:45,919
...for half an hour exactly
no matter what the weather.

212
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,256
And every evening at the same hour...

213
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:52,092
...he would walk into the consulting room.

214
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:54,161
He would then examine the books,

215
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,398
put down five crumpets
for every guinea I had earned...

216
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:59,633
...and then carried the rest
off to the strong box...

217
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,733
...in his own room.

218
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:08,442
I may say with confidence Mr. Holmes...

219
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:11,678
...that he never had occasion
to regret his speculation.

220
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,314
From the first it was a success...

221
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,785
...and during the last two years
I have made him a rich man.

222
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:19,086
So much Mr. Holmes,

223
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:20,988
for my past history and my relations...

224
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,924
...with the resident patient Mr. Blessington.

225
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,759
It only remains for me now to tell you...

226
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:28,529
...what has occurred
to bring me here tonight.

227
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,965
Some weeks ago
Mr. Blessington came down to me...

228
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,967
...in as it seemed to me...

229
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,071
...a considerable state of agitation.

230
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:38,605
Dr. Travelian,

231
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,808
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian,

232
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,409
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian,

233
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,711
Dr. Travelian,
Dr. Travelian sir.

234
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,880
Mr. Blessington calm yourself sir.

235
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,316
Calm myself?
Calm myself?

236
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,586
But my dear sir
have you not heard of the burglary?

237
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,188
Burglary?

238
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:55,789
Where?

239
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,458
No, no, no not here sir,

240
00:15:58,592 --> 00:16:01,562
not here, but it could have been.

241
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:05,165
Could have been...

242
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,072
Within a week
the whole house had become...

243
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,541
...a fortress of bolts and bars and locks.

244
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,844
Are you sure
these bars are strong enough?

245
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:19,880
They'd be strong enough
for the bank of England, sir.

246
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,515
Mr. Blessington?

247
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:23,917
When I questioned him upon the point...

248
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,919
...he became so offensive
that I was compelled...

249
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,755
...to drop the subject.

250
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:30,624
At first Mr. Holmes
I thought he merely sought...

251
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,760
...to protect his strong box,

252
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,896
but then I suspected that it was his life...

253
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,698
...he was protecting.

254
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:41,235
From then on he stopped
going out all together,

255
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,437
peered continually out of his windows...

256
00:16:43,537 --> 00:16:46,673
...and kept himself locked
in his room in what

257
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:50,853
I could only describe
as a state of mortal dread.

258
00:17:20,741 --> 00:17:23,777
Dr. Travelian,
before you continue,

259
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:27,014
you say you found this man Blessington...

260
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,917
...prostrate on his bed
clutching a newspaper?

261
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:33,454
More precisely the
remains of a newspaper...

262
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:36,156
...for he had torn it to shreds.

263
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:39,626
Torn to shreds.

264
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:46,066
Do you recall the contents
of this newspaper at all?

265
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,669
No, I'm afraid not even if
I'd known what I was looking for.

266
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:49,770
When was this?

267
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,105
It was some weeks ago,

268
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,906
the beginning of May I think.

269
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:56,310
Gradually as time passed
his fears appeared to die away...

270
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,470
...and he renewed his former habits.

271
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,415
Good evening Dr. Travelian.

272
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,983
Wonderful evening outside.

273
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,853
I'm beginning to enjoy my walks again.

274
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,778
And then suddenly
a fresh event reduced him...

275
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:11,725
...to the pitiable state of prostration...

276
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,094
...in which he now lies.

277
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:17,064
What happened was
yesterday I received this letter...

278
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:20,401
...from a Russian nobleman
now resident in England...

279
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:22,536
...who suffers from catalepsy.

280
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,838
In it he announces
his intention of visiting me...

281
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,774
...for a consultation this very evening...

282
00:18:26,874 --> 00:18:28,999
...at a quarter past six.

283
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:36,817
Because of the chief difficulty
in the study of catalepsy...

284
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,153
...and the rareness of the disease...

285
00:18:39,253 --> 00:18:41,789
...you may believe that
at the appointed hour

286
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,957
I was eager to receive the patient.

287
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:45,893
Good evening gentlemen.

288
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:48,362
I'm Dr. Travelian and it was you sir

289
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,587
I assume who wrote to me?

290
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:54,168
My father speaks very little English doctor,

291
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:57,771
so I trust you will
excuse my coming in with him...

292
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,973
...as his health is a matter...

293
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:02,910
...of the most overwhelming
importance to me.

294
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,144
Yes,
I respect that sir.

295
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,245
Fenton,

296
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,483
perhaps you would like to
join us for the consultation?

297
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,985
Nyet, nyet,
not for all of the world.

298
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:15,389
It is more painful to me than I can express.

299
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,324
If I were to see my father in one of those...

300
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:19,626
...dreadful seizures I am convinced

301
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:21,895
I would never survive it.

302
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,531
My own nervous system...

303
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,234
...is an exceptionally sensitive one.

304
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,737
With your permission I will remain...

305
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,539
...in your waiting room while
you go into my father's case.

306
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,308
Yes,
of course.

307
00:19:34,408 --> 00:19:36,408
thank you doctor.

308
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,590
Thank you Fenton.

309
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:56,063
Now sir, I hope you will forgive me...

310
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:59,500
...if I ask you a few basic questions.

311
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,171
First,
can you tell me your age?

312
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:07,508
Sixty-seven.

313
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:10,577
And apart from catalepsy...

314
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:14,081
...would you say you are physically sound?

315
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:17,584
Normally do you have good health?

316
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:20,854
Um,
no headaches?

317
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:23,657
Abdominal pain?

318
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:26,560
Any pain at all?

319
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,362
No.

320
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,462
Good.

321
00:20:30,497 --> 00:20:34,067
Naturally I will examine you thoroughly...

322
00:20:34,168 --> 00:20:37,237
...but this is merely a preliminary.

323
00:20:37,371 --> 00:20:39,840
Do you smoke cigars?

324
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
Yes.

325
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,478
Do you drink alcohol?

326
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:46,313
Vodka.

327
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:48,215
Vodka?

328
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,784
I see.

329
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:53,954
Every day?

330
00:21:04,198 --> 00:21:06,198
I didn't expect...

331
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:13,640
...my first feeling was
one of pity and horror.

332
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,943
My second I fear was rather...

333
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:18,512
...one of professional satisfaction.

334
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:21,715
There was nothing markedly
abnormal in his condition...

335
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:25,119
...which had harmonized
with my former experiences.

336
00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,422
I had obtained good results in such cases.

337
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:31,291
By the inhalation of nitrite of alma...

338
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:34,461
...and the present seemed
an admirable opportunity...

339
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:36,797
...of testing its virtues.

340
00:21:36,897 --> 00:21:40,334
Now sir, I believe you can hear me.

341
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:43,749
I should be back directly rest assured.

342
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,829
Fenton,

343
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,232
Fenton,
Fenton immediately.

344
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:54,875
Fenton, the two gentlemen you showed in...

345
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:56,310
...less than 15 minutes ago,

346
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,978
did you see them leave?

347
00:22:58,078 --> 00:22:59,747
Leave, no sir.

348
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,281
Are you sure?

349
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,381
I'm positive sir.

350
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:14,795
Good evening Dr. Travelian.

351
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,030
Good evening Mr. Blessington...

352
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,832
...and how was your walk today?

353
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,835
A little rain but very amiable my good sir.

354
00:23:21,935 --> 00:23:23,670
Very amiable.

355
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,607
Did you hear them leave?

356
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:28,142
No, sir.

357
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,277
I was nowhere near the hall.

358
00:23:30,377 --> 00:23:31,945
Well you should have been.

359
00:23:32,045 --> 00:23:33,280
That is your duty.

360
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,649
Now I know you are new here
but you should know by now.

361
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,851
Doctor.
doctor.

362
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:40,220
doctor.
doctor.

363
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,700
Someone has been in my room.

364
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,825
No one has been in your room sir.

365
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:45,993
A lie.

366
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,361
You're lying to me.

367
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,530
I assure you I am not.

368
00:23:49,663 --> 00:23:53,100
Fenton, have you been
in Mr. Blessington's room?

369
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Of course I haven't.

370
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,904
There you are you see.

371
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:59,894
Then come up and see for yourself.

372
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:08,148
Now sir.

373
00:24:08,248 --> 00:24:10,584
Look at those.

374
00:24:10,684 --> 00:24:15,088
Are you telling me that they're mine?

375
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:18,692
Well at first glance they do appear...

376
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:20,928
...to be too large for you.

377
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:23,497
Of course they're not mine.

378
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,667
I always remove
my galoshes at the front door.

379
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:28,602
Has anything been stolen?

380
00:24:28,702 --> 00:24:31,167
No, but that's not the point.

381
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:32,973
Nothing has been stolen?

382
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:35,275
My privacy has been invaded by a stranger,

383
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,375
is that not enough?

384
00:24:53,427 --> 00:24:56,463
Mr. Blessington?

385
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,066
Mr. Blessington?

386
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,370
Leave me alone,
go away and leave me alone.

387
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,440
Surely there's something I can do to help.

388
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,409
Shall I call the police?

389
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:12,045
No... Not those buglers.

390
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:18,318
There's only
one person who can help me now.

391
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:21,488
And that is why I am here.

392
00:25:21,622 --> 00:25:25,092
But I must apologize
for such a trivial reason.

393
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,495
A thief that doesn't steal.

394
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:31,064
Did he ask for me by name?

395
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,033
Oh, yes.

396
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:37,404
Then let us be on our way.

397
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,112
Thank you.

398
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,212
This way?

399
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,055
Stay where you are.

400
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,257
I have a pistol and I give you my word

401
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:59,560
I will shoot if you come any nearer.

402
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,463
Mr. Blessington this is outrageous sir.

403
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:05,466
Do you not recognize me?

404
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,569
Is that you doctor?

405
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:11,038
Yes, of course it is me.

406
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:12,940
The other two gentlemen,

407
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,275
are they what they pretend to be?

408
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,877
They are Mr. Sherlock Holmes...

409
00:26:16,977 --> 00:26:18,879
...and his friend Dr. Watson.

410
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:20,547
Good God Mr. Blessington,

411
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,350
it was you that asked me to fetch them.

412
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,721
Yes, yes, yes,
forgive me,

413
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:29,821
forgive me.

414
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,901
Gentlemen do come up.

415
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:48,509
I'm sorry if my precautions
have annoyed you.

416
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,310
Good evening Mr. Holmes.

417
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,179
I'm sure I'm very much obliged...

418
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:53,914
...to you for coming around.

419
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,551
No one has ever needed
your advice more than l, no one.

420
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,887
I expect Dr. Travelian has told you...

421
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:02,689
...of this unwarrantable intrusion
into my rooms.

422
00:27:02,789 --> 00:27:03,991
My sir,
Mr. Blessington,

423
00:27:04,091 --> 00:27:05,859
who are these two men?

424
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,395
Which two men,
I don't know them.

425
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,731
Then why do they wish to molest you?

426
00:27:10,831 --> 00:27:12,166
Molest me?

427
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:15,335
You could hardly expect me to answer that.

428
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:17,671
You mean that you don't know?

429
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:20,174
Come in here,
please.

430
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:24,278
Just have the kindness to step in here.

431
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:41,295
I've never been a rich man,
Mr. Holmes.

432
00:27:41,395 --> 00:27:43,731
I've never made but one
investment in my life,

433
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,066
Dr. Travelian will tell you that...

434
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:49,069
...but I don't believe in bankers sir.

435
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,172
Never trust a banker Mr. Holmes, never.

436
00:27:52,272 --> 00:27:54,575
It's between ourselves.

437
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,911
What little I have is here in this strong box.

438
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:00,381
So you can understand
what it means to me...

439
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,550
...when unknown people force
themselves into my rooms.

440
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:09,323
Mr. Blessington
I cannot possibly advise you...

441
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:13,160
...if you try to deceive me.

442
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,928
Deceive you?

443
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:17,831
But I've told you everything.

444
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:20,056
Good night Dr. Travelian.

445
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,537
Mr. Holmes,
no advice for me?

446
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,985
My advice to you is to speak the truth.

447
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,248
Holmes?

448
00:28:47,528 --> 00:28:49,528
Cab.

449
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:54,001
Holmes.

450
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:55,602
I can read in a man's eyes...

451
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,272
...when it's his own skin
that he's frightened of.

452
00:28:58,372 --> 00:29:00,174
Yes, But why did you call him a liar?

453
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:03,343
Because I am certain that
he does know who these men are.

454
00:29:03,443 --> 00:29:05,443
Cab.

455
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,285
A young Russian penetrated
to Blessington's rooms...

456
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,388
...while his confederate kept
the doctor from interfering.

457
00:29:14,488 --> 00:29:17,591
And of course catalepsy is a
very easy complaint to imitate.

458
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:19,393
Yes, I know I've done it myself.

459
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:21,728
Holmes?

460
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:23,997
Might there be one alternative,

461
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:27,501
grotesquely improbably no doubt
but still just conceivable,

462
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,237
might the whole story
of the cataleptic Russian...

463
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,473
...and son be a concoction
of Dr. Travelian...

464
00:29:32,573 --> 00:29:35,242
...who for his own purposes
has been in Blessington's room?

465
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:38,011
But did you see the footprints
on the stair carpet?

466
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,547
They were square toed,
quite unlike Blessington's...

467
00:29:40,647 --> 00:29:43,050
...which are round and an
inch and a third longer...

468
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,150
...than Dr. Travelians.

469
00:29:45,252 --> 00:29:47,955
I think we can sleep on this Watson...

470
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:49,890
...but I should be surprised
if we do not hear...

471
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,759
...from Brook Street in the morning.

472
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,427
Good night.

473
00:29:53,527 --> 00:29:55,527
Night old fellow.

474
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,775
Morning doctor.

475
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:09,510
Your tea is here.

476
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,610
Thank you Nora.

477
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:39,406
Mr. Blessington,
your breakfast tea.

478
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,343
Mr. Blessington?

479
00:31:18,045 --> 00:31:20,681
Watson...

480
00:31:20,781 --> 00:31:22,349
...get dressed quickly.

481
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:24,351
There's a cab waiting for us.

482
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,319
Why?

483
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,787
What's the matter?

484
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,689
The Brook Street business.

485
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:31,391
Any fresh news?

486
00:31:31,525 --> 00:31:37,798
For God's sake,
come at once, P. Travelian.

487
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,669
Oh, Mr. Holmes
I'm so glad you could come.

488
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,271
What has happened?

489
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,407
Mr. Blessington has committed suicide.

490
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:47,508
Suicide?

491
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:48,442
Yes.

492
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:51,347
He hung himself during the night.

493
00:31:58,318 --> 00:31:59,953
Has the body been touched?

494
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:01,555
No.

495
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:04,124
Where's the page?

496
00:32:04,224 --> 00:32:06,224
Nowhere to be found.

497
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,282
Good morning inspector.

498
00:32:28,382 --> 00:32:30,818
Mr. Holmes,
delighted to see you.

499
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:32,453
Now please take a look.

500
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:35,613
We were just about to take him down.

501
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,042
Right, inspector.

502
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,175
Stretcher.

503
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,571
That'll be all.

504
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,242
Have heard of the events
leading up to this affair?

505
00:33:28,342 --> 00:33:31,145
Yes, Dr. Travelian
has told me something of them.

506
00:33:31,245 --> 00:33:32,012
And have you formed an opinion?

507
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:33,647
Now as far as I can see,
the man was driven...

508
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:36,016
...out of his senses by fright.

509
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:38,152
The bed has been well slept in.

510
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:41,288
There was his impression
deep enough for all to see.

511
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:43,691
It is about 5:00 in the morning.

512
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:45,793
You know that suicides are most common.

513
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:48,562
That would be about the time
that he hanged himself.

514
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:51,131
It seems to be a very deliberate affair.

515
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,167
Yes, from the rigidity of the limbs

516
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:55,269
I'd say he'd been dead about three hours.

517
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,503
Thank you Watson.

518
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:58,872
Notice anything peculiar about the room.

519
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:01,675
There was a screwdriver
on the mantel piece...

520
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,511
...and he seems to have
smoked heavily during the night.

521
00:34:04,611 --> 00:34:07,246
I found these in the fireplace.

522
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,821
Have you his cigar holder?

523
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,390
No,
I haven't seen one.

524
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,326
His cigar case then?

525
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:22,061
Yes, it was in his coat pocket.

526
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:32,473
This is savannah,

527
00:34:32,606 --> 00:34:36,477
And these others are
the cigars of a peculiar sort...

528
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:38,278
...which is imported by the Dutch...

529
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,114
...from the East Indian colonies.

530
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:43,250
They're usually wrapped in straw
you know and are thinner...

531
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,652
...for their length than any other brand.

532
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,554
I don't suppose you've read monograph...

533
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:49,423
...on cigars and cigar action?

534
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:50,691
Well l, um...

535
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,393
No, of course not.
Thank you.

536
00:34:55,896 --> 00:34:59,600
These have been smoked
with a holder and these without.

537
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,404
These have been cut
by a not very sharp knife...

538
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:07,241
...and these have had their ends bitten off...

539
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:12,045
...by a set of very excellent teeth.

540
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:18,652
There were three men here last night.

541
00:35:18,786 --> 00:35:23,624
Good heavens but nothing was stolen...

542
00:35:23,724 --> 00:35:25,826
...so what were they doing here?

543
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:28,562
That is what we have to find out.

544
00:35:28,662 --> 00:35:30,364
How did they get in?

545
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:33,133
The same way we did
through the front door.

546
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:35,502
But the door was barred in the morning.

547
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:37,438
Then it was barred after they left.

548
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:39,206
Well how do you know that?

549
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:41,306
I saw their traces.

550
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:43,444
If you would just give me
a few moments Inspector,

551
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:47,794
I may be able to give you
some further information.

552
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,521
Don't move Watson.

553
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:30,310
The actual facts are very simple.

554
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,546
And I shall be surprised if by the afternoon

555
00:38:32,646 --> 00:38:35,015
I cannot give you the reasons
for them as well.

556
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:37,785
But Holmes, can't
you tell us anything now?

557
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:43,590
Oh, there is no doubt
as to the sequence of events.

558
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,226
The three of them in it.

559
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,162
A young man,
an old man...

560
00:38:48,262 --> 00:38:52,342
...and a third to whose
identity I have no clue.

561
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:56,670
The first two I need hardly remark...

562
00:38:56,770 --> 00:39:00,574
...are the same who masqueraded as
the Russian Count and his son.

563
00:39:00,674 --> 00:39:03,010
So we can give a very good
description of them,

564
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,878
can we not Dr. Travelian?

565
00:39:04,978 --> 00:39:06,980
They were admitted by a confederate...

566
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,080
...inside the house.

567
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,589
They entered the hall.

568
00:39:15,722 --> 00:39:19,126
The older man first,
the younger man second...

569
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:23,063
...and the unknown man in the rear.

570
00:39:23,163 --> 00:39:27,468
They ascended the stairs.

571
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:39,012
With the help of a wire they forced the key.

572
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:41,582
Even without the lens you can see where...

573
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:43,851
...the pressure has been applied.

574
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:47,888
On entering the room the first proceeding...

575
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:52,059
...must have been to gag Mr. Blessington.

576
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:02,302
Having secured Blessington
it is evident to me...

577
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:05,939
...that a consultation
of some sort was held...

578
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:09,610
...probably in the nature
of a judicial proceeding.

579
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,612
It must have lasted for some time...

580
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:14,014
...for it was then that
the cigars were smoked.

581
00:40:14,114 --> 00:40:15,783
It was there that the older man sat...

582
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,185
...in the wicker chair.

583
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:20,788
It was he who used the cigar holder.

584
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:23,190
The younger man sat there.

585
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,193
He knocked his ash off
against the chest of drawers.

586
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:29,663
The unknown fellow paced up and down.

587
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,866
Blessington I think sat upright in the bed,

588
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:36,036
but of that I cannot be absolutely certain.

589
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:40,340
It ended of course
by them taking Blessington...

590
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,542
Now this matter was so prearranged...

591
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:51,445
...that it is my belief
that they brought with them...

592
00:41:51,545 --> 00:41:54,848
...some sort of block
or pulley to serve as a gallows.

593
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:57,785
Oh, yes as gallows Inspector.

594
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:01,121
This was a revenge ritual.

595
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:04,725
Well an extraordinary story.

596
00:42:04,858 --> 00:42:07,227
But what proof?

597
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:11,231
I'll have it before the day is out.

598
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:13,033
You haven't explained about...

599
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,835
...the screws and the screwdriver.

600
00:42:14,935 --> 00:42:17,304
Oh, that was to fix up the block or pulley.

601
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:19,039
But when they saw the chandelier hook...

602
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:21,508
...they naturally
saved themselves the trouble.

603
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:24,345
No Inspector I suggest that you
immediately make inquiries...

604
00:42:24,445 --> 00:42:26,313
...about the page and arrest him.

605
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:27,848
Certainly Mr. Holmes.

606
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:30,217
I will be back here a little before 3:00.

607
00:42:30,317 --> 00:42:32,317
Good day.

608
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,044
I daresay Mrs. Hudson will
be a little put out...

609
00:42:57,144 --> 00:42:59,046
...when she sees all this.

610
00:42:59,146 --> 00:43:02,049
What are you looking for?

611
00:43:02,149 --> 00:43:04,018
Worthington, W,

612
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:08,055
Worthingon, March 1880 I'm sure.

613
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:10,188
March '80,

614
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:16,528
'80,

615
00:43:19,366 --> 00:43:20,934
January,

616
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:23,403
February,

617
00:43:23,504 --> 00:43:26,373
March.

618
00:43:26,473 --> 00:43:29,209
Any good?

619
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:32,980
Watson...

620
00:43:33,113 --> 00:43:38,652
Blessington or Sutton
as he was known then.

621
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:43,490
Mrs. Hudson.

622
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,628
Your little boat is coming along
beautifully Doctor.

623
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:50,030
Oh, thank you Mrs. Hudson.

624
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,130
I must run.

625
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,250
Ah, thank you.

626
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,555
Dr. Travelian.

627
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:15,356
Any news Inspector?

628
00:44:15,456 --> 00:44:16,857
Yes, sir we've got the page...

629
00:44:16,957 --> 00:44:19,026
...drinking his earnings two streets away.

630
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:20,294
But I got the man.

631
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:21,628
You've got them?

632
00:44:21,728 --> 00:44:23,797
Or at least I've got their identity.

633
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:25,599
The Worthington Bank Gang?

634
00:44:25,699 --> 00:44:26,934
Precisely.

635
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,169
Well then Blessington
must have been Sutton.

636
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,337
Exactly.

637
00:44:30,437 --> 00:44:32,406
Well that makes it clear as crystal.

638
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:33,974
not to me I'm afraid.

639
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:35,342
Dr. Watson would you, uh...

640
00:44:35,442 --> 00:44:36,810
You may have heard of the great

641
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:39,079
Worthington bank affair?

642
00:44:39,213 --> 00:44:40,914
There were five men in it.

643
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:43,017
The three who were in this room,

644
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:46,687
a fourth named Cartwright and Blessington.

645
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,391
Alright,
let's be gone.

646
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,418
It's a hanging job now.

647
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:23,056
Only if someone squeals.

648
00:45:30,264 --> 00:45:31,532
That's him.

649
00:45:31,632 --> 00:45:34,034
Are you positive?

650
00:45:34,134 --> 00:45:38,439
Oh, yes,
that's him.

651
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:45,779
Sutton, Sutton,
you're dead, dead, dead.

652
00:45:45,879 --> 00:45:49,016
Sutton,
you're dead.

653
00:45:49,149 --> 00:45:51,952
Sutton...

654
00:45:52,052 --> 00:45:55,962
Don't worry Mr. Sutton,
it's a hanging job now.

655
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:00,394
Sutton, you hear.

656
00:46:00,494 --> 00:46:02,563
Sutton or Blessington...

657
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:05,699
...who was the worst
of the gang turned informer.

658
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,669
On his evidence Cartright was hanged...

659
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,973
...and the other three got 15 years apiece.

660
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:15,676
Bibel, Haywood and Moffit...

661
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:18,345
...were released from prison
just a few weeks ago...

662
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:21,015
...which was several years
before their full term.

663
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,784
It was news of their release
which caused Blessington...

664
00:46:23,884 --> 00:46:25,819
...to panic and have this house secured.

665
00:46:25,919 --> 00:46:28,355
So it was not the fear
burglary that had frightened him?

666
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,958
No, no,
that was a mere blind.

667
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:32,793
And so setting me up in practice...

668
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:36,803
...was an elaborate charade
to protect himself.

669
00:46:41,001 --> 00:46:43,037
Well why could he not tell you this?

670
00:46:43,137 --> 00:46:45,172
He was trying to hide his own identity...

671
00:46:45,272 --> 00:46:47,574
...from everybody for as long as he could.

672
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,243
His secret was shameful...

673
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,912
...and he couldn't bring
himself to divulge it.

674
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:54,114
However,
wretch as he was...

675
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:57,251
...he was still living under
the shield of British law.

676
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:59,019
And I have no doubt Inspector...

677
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,656
...that we shall see that though
that shield may fail to guard,

678
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:06,760
the sword of justice is still there to avenge.

679
00:47:06,894 --> 00:47:09,630
In spite of the efforts of Sherlock Holmes...

680
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:11,965
...the three murderers of Blessington...

681
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:14,234
...eluded the police and fled the country...

682
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:16,270
...aboard a ship bound for Portugal.

683
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,872
It was a few weeks later that we learned...

684
00:47:18,972 --> 00:47:20,941
...that the ship,
the Nora Crainer...

685
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:24,078
...had sunk with all hands upon
the Portuguese Coast...

686
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:27,663
...some leagues to the north of a porter.

687
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:58,212
Holmes.

688
00:47:58,312 --> 00:48:01,148
What's wrong?

689
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:04,618
Well it's just that I was going
to spend the day writing...

690
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:07,521
...the case of Dr. Travelian...

691
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:10,124
...while the facts are still fresh.

692
00:48:10,224 --> 00:48:12,944
Oh, you mean...
oh, I understand.

693
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,829
Thanks awfully.

694
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:22,336
It's just that it is difficult
to concentrate otherwise.

695
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:32,146
What will you entitle
this particular account?

696
00:48:32,279 --> 00:48:36,917
I didn't know you were
interested in my writing.

697
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:41,488
I am always interested
in your choice of titles.

698
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:44,658
Well I thought I would call it...

699
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:47,172
...the Brook Street Mystery.

700
00:48:51,565 --> 00:48:52,900
No?

701
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,102
Well I myself would prefer

702
00:48:55,202 --> 00:48:57,838
The Resident Patient,
but please...

703
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,573
...do not let me influence you.

704
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:09,082
The Brook Street Mystery
no doubt would suffice.
