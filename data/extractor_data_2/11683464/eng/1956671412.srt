This ain't sounding

It is. Stephen Hawking
is giving a lecture,

21

not Dallas. Where?

38

I would like
to discuss this further,

53
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:16,701
22 seconds to be in the shower,
and buttons slow me down.

(KNOCKING)

360
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:58,489
What?

361
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,337
I know you don't want to talk,
and that's fine.

362
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:03,059
You can just listen.

363
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:07,150
(SIGHS) Life is hard enough
if you make good decisions,

364
00:14:07,194 --> 00:14:10,371
but if you make bad ones,
it gets even harder.

365
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,634
Nothin' was gonna happen
with Jana.

366
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,244
Georgie... No!

367
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:15,767
You always assume
the worst with me.

368
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm sorry you were a perfect kid
and I'm just a screwup.

369
00:14:18,683 --> 00:14:21,382
You are not a screwup.

370
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,557
(SIGHS)

371
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,776
And I was not a perfect kid.

372
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,518
Oh, what'd you do, sleep
through church one mornin'?

373
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,914
For your information...

374
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,699
I used to skip class...

375
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,353
so that I could

376
00:14:36,397 --> 00:14:38,312
drink beer

377
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,357
in my boyfriend's truck.

378
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:43,578
Dad had a truck back then?

379
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,189
Not talkin' about your dad.

380
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,017
Whoa.

381
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,066
I also...

382
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,242
stole your meemaw's car

383
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:57,679
and crashed it into a ditch.

384
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:58,810
Really?

385
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:00,290
With that boyfriend
who wasn't Dad?

386
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,118
Missin' the point!
If the point is

387
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,381
you made some bad decisions
and turned out fine,

388
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:06,122
then why you being
so hard on me?

389
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:09,909
Because some decisions
you cannot walk away from

390
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,433
and they will affect
the rest of your life.

391
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,627
If you're talkin' about
Jana getting pregnant,

392
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,044
she ain't gonna.

393
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:17,699
That is what I thought,
and the next thing I know,

394
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,919
I'm at the courthouse
gettin' married.

395
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,312
You got married

396
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,748
because you were pregnant?

397
00:15:27,274 --> 00:15:28,928
Yes.

398
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,105
So, I was a mistake?

399
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:34,150
No! No!

400
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,325
(GROANS)

401
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,371
You are a blessin'.

402
00:15:37,414 --> 00:15:39,503
The mistake

403
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,245
was lyin' to my parents,
so that I could spend

404
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,379
the night at your dad's house.

405
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:47,555
And, you know, tequila.

406
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:49,446
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

407
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,038
We're expecting a smooth
flight to Los Angeles.

408
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,475
Before we take off,
please direct your attention

409
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,346
to the flight attendants
as they review

410
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,435
some important
safety procedures.

411
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,047
"Safety procedures"?
Oh, baby.

412
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,049
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Take a minute to locate

413
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:04,920
the exit closest to you.

414
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,748
The nearest exit
could be behind you.

415
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,532
Should the cabin experience

416
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:11,231
sudden pressure loss,
oxygen masks will

417
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:12,928
drop down
from above your seat...

418
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,017
Why would the cabin
lose pressure?

419
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,541
It won't.Place the mask over
your mouth and nose,

420
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:20,762
like this, pull the strap
to tighten it.

421
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:23,330
If you are traveling with
children, make sure that your

422
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,159
own mask is on first
before helping your child...

423
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,378
I don't like this at all.

424
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:29,814
It's just a precaution.

425
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:32,034
You know... perfectly safe.

426
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,644
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
In the unlikely event

427
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:35,733
of a water landing
and evacuation... (HEART BEATING)

428
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:39,041
(ECHOING): Water landing, water
landing, water landing...

429
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,260
I can't do this.

430
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:41,522
(BUCKLE CLICKING)

431
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,528
Keep going,
we'll be right back.

432
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:48,833
Uh, sir?!

433
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:51,358
Sheldon, come out of there! No!

434
00:16:51,401 --> 00:16:53,664
At least open the door.

435
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,754
Tell them I need to get off.

436
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,365
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Sir?

437
00:16:58,408 --> 00:17:00,062
You both need
to return to your seats.

438
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,977
Just one second.

439
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,021
Sir. Sir...

440
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,373
If you want to see
Stephen Hawking,

441
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,592
we have to sit down right now.

442
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:11,117
It's too dangerous. I can't!
It's okay to be scared.

443
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,182
Sir? Th-That's when you got
to dig deep and be brave.

444
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,121
(POUNDING ON DOOR)
So, what do you say?

445
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,514
No, I'm your terrified
little boy!

446
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,950
Okay.
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

447
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:20,865
Sir, please, they're
gonna call security!

448
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:21,997
Just one more second.

449
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,435
Mr. Spock!

450
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,872
He flies around all the time
in that spaceship.

451
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,744
He's not afraid, is he?

452
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,615
I'm not Mr. Spock.

453
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:34,792
No, but-but I've seen you
pretend to be him.

454
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,491
Could you do that right now?

455
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,884
You be Spock, I'll be Kirk.

456
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,889
(SIGHS) Maybe.

457
00:17:44,933 --> 00:17:48,241
Okay, Mr. Spock.

458
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:51,461
Your first order
is to return to your seat.

459
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,595
Aye, Captain.

460
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,947
CAPTAIN: Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

461
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:04,561
You okay, Mr. Spock?

462
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,607
Doing my best, sir.

(ENGINES ROAR)

464
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,658
The captain and Mr. Spock
don't hold hands.

465
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,704
Sorry.

466
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,758
Okay, maybe just this once.

467
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:36,202
(STAR TREKTHEME PLAYING)

468
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,867
I think we've been lied to
about California.

469
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:52,087
No one on this campus
is tan at all.

470
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,438
No, they are not.

471
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,748
Imagine all the stimulating
conversations

472
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,837
that must go on at these tables.

473
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,360
I bet.

474
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,060
I can see myself
going here one day.

475
00:19:09,104 --> 00:19:12,107
I think you'd fit right in.
