00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,910
孩子们  当你们都 快30岁的时候  可能会惊讶的
Kids, when you reach your late 20s you might be surprised

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,910
发现你还是搞不懂生活是什么
to discover you still don't have life quite figured out.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,490
就像莉莉阿姨一样
Like with Aunt Lily.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,600
即使她是从旧金山回来的
Even though she was back from San Francisco,

5
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,670
她仍然还在寻找自我
she was still on a quest to find herself.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,820
我不想当幼儿园老师了
It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten.

7
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:18,250
我要辞职  我要改变世界
I want to get out there and change the world.

8
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,810
我要找回自己的激情
I want to find my passion.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,490
她也确实做到了
And she did find it.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,250
我要去当个人生指导师
I'm going to be a life coach.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,400
事实上  她的热情源源不断
In fact, she found it again and again.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,060
我要去当个海洋生物学家

13
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,380
行为诗人...养蜂人...
...slam poet. ...beekeeper!

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,210
我不想当养蜂人了
Not a beekeeper.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,090
她最新的人生梦想呢?
Her newest lifelong dream?

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,220
朋克风格乐队的主唱
Singing in a punk rock band.

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,000
那她钱哪里来的啊?
What is she doing for money through all this?

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,340
她在餐馆当服务生
Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.

19
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,940
难道是在那个夏威夷风格的餐馆?
Wait, you mean that Hawaiian place

20
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,160
服务生穿着夏威夷的草裙
where they wear those embarrassing outfits?

21
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,970
不可能
No.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,860
她来啦　她来啦
Here she comes. Here she comes.

23
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,710
欢迎光临  你们现在点菜吗?
Welcome to Big Wave Luau. May I tiki your drink order?

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,210
晕  混蛋
Aw, crap.

25
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,540
对不起
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,630
你好  莉莉 我们正好在附近
Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood,

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,350
想找个地方吃饭 但我们不知道原来你在这
thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here.

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,760
要吃什么?
What do you want?

29
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,710
不会吧 你就这样在餐馆里...
Oh, I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,730
招待客人吗?
a customer at Big Wave Luau.

31
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,200
你好  游客们 (夏威夷语)
Aloha, island visitors.

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,800
浪花把你们带到 我们这简陋的餐厅
The big wave brought you to our humble luau.

33
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,800
因此我们要用我们的母语说  谢谢 (夏威夷语)
For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.

34
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,780
我没听清楚你的名字 你们听清了吗?
I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?

35
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:33,200
没有
No.

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,240
我叫阿努花
My name is Anuhea.

37
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,260
它的意思是 凉爽  芬芳
It means cool and fragrant,

38
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,310
就像我们餐馆的12种特色饮料
much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,680
罗宾  你还要点什么吗?
Robin, nothing to add?

40
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:45,500
不要了  莉莉是我的朋友 我不会因为她为了实现梦想
No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,030
而去取笑他
for trying to follow her dreams.

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
谢谢 (讽刺的口气)
Thank you.

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,170
但是可能你要拿出你的夏威夷鼓来
Although, you might want to bring out the big Hawaiian drum

44
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,710
因为今天就是我的生日
because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,410
生日快乐!
Birthday girl!

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,430
我今天特别想喝酒
I have never needed beer more than I do right now.

51
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,650
我以为你这学期的论文 简单的就象吃块蛋糕
I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake.

52
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,040
我记得是因为你说 这话的时候就在吃蛋糕
I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time

53
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,040
然后你说 "哥们  这学期的论文就这么简单"
and you said, "Dude, my semester is gonna be this."

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,300
是啊  本来会是这样
Yeah, well, it was supposed to be,

55
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,100
但是我的教授 是我有史以来见过最严格的
but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen.

56
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,010
她今年夏天刚离了婚
She had like a bad divorce this summer

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,950
现在开始在我们身上发泄了
and now she's taking it out on us.

58
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,220
老实说  我觉得她只是需要男人
To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.

59
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,370
真的?
Really?

60
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,920
男人  你意思是?
Laid, you say?

61
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,810
你不会对她有兴趣? 她已经快五十了...
You wouldn't be into her. She's, like, in her late 40s.

62
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,180
她漂亮吗?
She hot?

63
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,050
有点漂亮吧?
Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.

64
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,520
而且她很饥渴...
And she's looking for some action.

65
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,870
对我来说 她就是只饥饿的美洲豹
Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,650
- 什么来着 - 美洲豹
- A what? - A cougar.

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,220
一个单身老女人 经常在她四十  五十岁时候
An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s,

68
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,520
经常会去寻觅些年轻男人
single and on the prowl for a younger man.

69
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,760
那六十  七十岁的女人 是什么来着? 海龟?
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s-- a turtle?

70
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,240
马修  我想过了 我接受这个挑战
Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.

71
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,180
- 我没让你去和她上床啊 - 明天  猎豹行动开始
- I didn't challenge you to have sex... - Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.

72
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,250
我要辞职了
So, I quit my job.

73
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,950
我受不了了
I just couldn't take it anymore.

74
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,640
每天大概有五十个男人向我要花环
Approximately 50 times a day, some guy asks me for a lei...

75
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,200
你太有才了
Classic.

76
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,510
泰德  你刚才不是跟我 说你们办公室需要一个助理?
Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,980
是啊
Yeah.

78
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,110
有人刚刚辞职了
Somebody did just quit.

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,610
我们中午哪里吃?
So, where should we eat today?

80
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,880
太好了 你给大家都买中饭了?
Oh awesome, you brought lunch for everyone?

81
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,230
你这也太不厚道了
Dude,  that is cold-blooded.

82
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,000
我很无辜的
It was an honest mistake.

83
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,990
你要是看到 一个人的盘子里有一整只鸡
Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it,

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,620
想当然就以为 是给大家准备的
it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.

85
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,110
你也太打击那个女孩子了
Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,810
那是一整只鸡啊
It was an whole chicken.

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,390
我有没有说过她是十二面型的
And did I mention she had 12 sides?

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,610
你现在又开始挑剔 她的体形了 你也太过分了
Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.

89
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,100
莉莉  你怎么样 想要那个工作吗?
So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?

90
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,610
我需要做什么吗?
What would I be doing?

91
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,210
你是个一般的办公室助理
Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.

92
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,130
你只要坐在那里 就在我的对面
You'll sit there. My station is right over here.

93
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,810
现在这里有些疯狂
And things are a little bit crazy right now

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,910
因为我们正在给 一个大客户设计一个建筑
'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.

95
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,120
- 是那个吗? - 对

96
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,770
这是模型
Here's the model.

97
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,790
你不会是开玩笑 这看起来象一个巨大的小弟弟
You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis.

98
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,860
我知道
I know.

99
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,480
德拉泽先生就是看不出来 (双关 偏爱的音译)
For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.

100
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,980
你怎么会看不出来?
How can he not see it?

101
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,410
- 你看  那里有... - 我知道
- I mean there's the... - I know.

102
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,950
- 而且这位置... - 我知道
- And the way it... - I know.

103
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,400
- 还有那两个小... - 我知道
- And the two little... - I know.

104
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,570
- 这真是... - 壮观?
- Wow, it is just... - Spectacular?

105
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,970
谢谢
Why, thank you.

106
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,490
莉莉  这是德拉泽先生 这个工程的主设计师
Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project.

107
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,410
莉莉是办公室的新助理
Lily's going to be our new office assistant.

108
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,410
- 哦 - 很高兴认识你
- Ah. - Nice to meet you.

109
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,900
是吗?
Isn't it?

110
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,810
我看过了你设计的屋顶阳台
Ted, I looked at your design for the penthouse balcony.

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,160
告诉我 你是不是想要当设计师
Tell me, do you want to be an architect?

112
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,100
我  嗯... 我就是一个设计师啊
I, uh... I am an architect.

113
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,340
真的吗?
Really?

114
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,270
我的六岁的侄子喜欢玩积木
Well, my six-year-old nephew plays with Legos.

115
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,530
他算是个设计师?
Is he an architect?

116
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,830
不能算 除非他通过了所有的资格考试
Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.

117
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,040
你很有前途
Ted, you've got promise.

118
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,510
但是你必须要更认真的向我学习
But you have to study what I do more carefully.

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,200
现在我要你给这个模型
Now I want you to design some Styrofoam trees

120
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,970
设计一些塑料的树
for the building model.

121
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,060
- 你能做到吗? - 当然
- Think you can handle that? - Absolutely.

122
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,050
很好  你是要去设计
Good. So you're going to design the...

123
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,100
- 塑料树 - 再说一遍  有精神点
- Styrofoam trees. - Once again-- with feeling.

124
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,160
- 塑料树 - 塑料树
- Styrofoam trees. - Styrofoam trees!

125
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,250
- 塑料树 - 这才算有精神
- Styrofoam trees! - That's the spirit.

126
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,900
现在　过来点
Now, gather 'round.

127
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,230
这已不单单是树了 这是生命...
This isn't just about trees, Ted. This is about life.

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,030
而且现在 你必须把这些树设计到位
And sometimes in life, you have to get the trees just right

129
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,930
否则你就要开除掉  懂吗?
or you're fired, hmm?

130
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,470
这人简直就是个...(混蛋  Lily指着洁宝形状的模型)
Man, that guy is a total, well...(Dick)

131
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,310
这就是路易斯教授的办公室
Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's Professor Lewis's office there.

132
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,610
我们去看看
Okay, let's take a look.

133
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,140
这就是一只美洲豹
Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right.

134
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,370
典型的
A prime specimen.

135
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,220
凭几个特征你 就能看出她是只美洲豹?
See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics.

136
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,820
看头发
Start with the hair.

137
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,160
美洲豹留着流行的发型
The  cougar keeps up with current hairstyles

138
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,370
作为一种伪装
as a form of camouflage.

139
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,260
这样她的猎物 就不会以为碰上了美洲豹
The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar

140
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,780
直到他无助地被美洲豹
until he's already being dragged, helpless,

141
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,370
拖回到他的窝
back to her lair.

142
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,820
现在  看她的上衣
Now, the blouse.

143
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,790
她会尽量的展示她的乳沟
The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,140
来迷惑她的猎物
to captivate her prey.

145
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,350
如果你真的盯着它看
If you're watching them bounce,

146
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:34,630
那她就要准备捕杀你了
she's about to pounce.

147
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,680
看到她的爪子了吗?
See the claws?

148
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,300
又长又锋利
Long and sharp,

149
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,730
足以赶走她的竞争者
to ward off rival females...

150
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,190
也能开赡养费的支票
or open alimony checks.

151
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,630
这只真的很正点
Yeah, this one's a beaut.

152
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,990
猎豹行动开始
Okay, let the hunt begin.

153
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,170
等等  等等... 我好像有点无法接受
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not so sure I'm comfortable

154
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,190
你去泡我的宪法学教授
with you hunting my constitutional law professor.

155
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,070
你愿意谁来给你的论文打分
Who do you rather have grading your papers--

156
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,910
一只野蛮的  饥渴的野猫
a savage, man-eating jungle cat,

157
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,810
还是只娇喘着的 满足了的猫咪?
or a purring, satisfied kitty?

158
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,820
上吧  巴尼
Go, Barney.

159
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,960
用你的身躯填饱那只饥饿的美洲豹
Go mount and stuff that cougar.

160
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,480
苏茜  我是路易 意大利的交换生
Scusi, I am Luigi, Italian exchange student.

161
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,210
我本来是要去教室的
I was, uh, walking to class,

162
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,130
但是忽然我看到了你...
but then I noticed you...

163
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,430
美丽的公主...
bella  principessa...

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,850
你要什么还是自己滚蛋?
Tell me what you want or get out.

165
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,240
真直接
Direct.

166
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,880
我喜欢这样
I like that.

167
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,490
我名字叫巴尼
The name's Barney.

168
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,890
我要的是...你
What I want... is you.

169
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,350
转身
Turn around.

170
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,860
我那里...两小时
My place. Two hours.

171
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,190
不要迟到
Don't be tardy.

172
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,510
我不敢相信 德拉泽先生竟然这么凶
I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people.

173
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,880
还有那个建筑设计 言语难以形容
And that building? Talk about overcompensating.

174
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,310
他平时没这么凶
He's not usually this bad.

175
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,860
这次是因为我们的合作者说的很明白
It's just that the partners have made it very clear

176
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,740
成败就在这个项目上
this project is make or break for us,

177
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,050
所以最近他有点暴躁
so lately he's been a little testy.

178
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,050
{\an8}Testy音近testis睾丸,暗指Ted公司的建筑模型

179
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,460
你们明白我的意思 想入非非...
You know what I mean-- crotchety.

180
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,460
{\an8}Crotchety音近crotch胯下

181
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,090
我只是觉得最近他有点艰难
I'm just saying it's been hard on him.

182
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,090
{\an8}Hard,这个不用多说了吧

183
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,880
好  够了  不说了
All right stop.

184
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,730
- 你给莉莉看过你的设计? - 还没
- Did you show Lily your design? - No.

185
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,320
- 什么设计? - 没什么
- What design? - It's nothing.

186
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,700
你的设计太好了
It's fantastic.

187
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,110
最近一直在忙他的设计
Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design.

188
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,650
这个设计看起来 不太象个小弟弟
And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia.

189
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,400
至少不是健康的小弟弟
At least, not healthy male genitalia.

190
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,830
你应该把你的设计个德拉泽先生看看
Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.

191
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,180
你开玩笑? 他是汉默・德拉泽
Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers.

192
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,730
传奇人物 我只不过是他团队里的一员
He's a legend. I'm just part of his team.

193
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,090
这个设计对公司来说很重要
This building is huge for the firm,

194
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,420
所以现在我们千万不能搞砸了
so it's really important we don't blow it.

195
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,420
{\an8}blow也有吹箫的意思..你懂得

196
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,800
好了  够了
All right, enough.

197
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,670
天那  难以置信
Oh, my God. Incredible.

198
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,630
你的分数是C-
Hmm... C-minus.

199
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,450
才C-? 你说什么?
C-minus? What are you talking about?

200
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,960
我可是干了一个通宵啊!
I just pulled an all-nighter!

201
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,370
你没有分配好你的时间
You didn't budget your time well,

202
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,310
你忽略了一些很重要的部分
you glossed over some of the most important points,

203
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,620
而且你的嘴功太差
and your oral presentation was sloppy and inconclusive.

204
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,670
德拉泽先生要我问你 你是不是在做树了?
Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees

205
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,350
还是在等它们自己发芽长大
or waiting for them to sprout on their own.

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,040
然后他就一直盯着我 看着我发笑
Then he stared at me until I laughed.

207
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,230
好了  完成了
Okay, I'm done.

208
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,540
太好了  我把这些颜料收拾下 你去拿给他看
Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.

209
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,160
好  谢谢
Great. Thanks.

210
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,690
终于来了
Well, finally.

211
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,330
我在想你在做树呢
I wondered whether you were making the trees

212
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,410
还是在等它们自己发芽长大
or waiting for them to sprout on their own.

213
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,850
这笑话真好笑
Good one, sir.

214
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,060
你看一下这些模型
Anyway, here they are.

215
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,840
- 太绿了 - 太绿了?
- Too green. - Too green?

216
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,820
叶子应该有一种天然的褐色
Yes, the leaves should really be more of a natural brown color.

217
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,180
接近深褐色
Almost brunette.

218
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,390
想想灌木丛  我想要这个建筑
And think bushier. I want this tower to rise

219
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,540
耸立在一片浓密 原始的深褐色的丛林之中
from a thicket of wild, ungroomed, brunette shrubbery.

220
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:01,540
{\an8}这几句Ted老板说的又可理解为那个洁宝形状建筑的阴毛(棕色的....汗...)

221
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,590
你能想象  泰德?
Can you picture it, Ted?

222
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,890
我不可能想象不出来?
I can't un-picture it.

223
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,640
很好
Good.

224
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,480
天哪
Oh, my God.

225
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,580
它不见了
It's gone!

226
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,270
什么?什么不见了?
What? What's gone?

227
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,080
有三个彼特・罗斯签名的棒球 (著名的击球手)
My baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.

228
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:19,670
它应该在办公室的某个地方?
Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.

229
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,960
你是这么认为的?
What do you think, Ted,

230
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,730
棒球自己溜了出来 然后滚到了某个地方?
it just let itself out of its plastic case and rolled away?

231
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,720
有人偷了它
Somebody stole it.

232
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,840
我得回去继续弄塑料树了
Well, um, I better get back to these Styrofoam trees.

233
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,920
谁会在意那些树
Oh, who cares about the trees?

234
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,440
这只不过是给你个差 让你觉得自己还用
It's just busy work to make you feel like you're contributing.

235
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,760
你总是在鼓励我
Inspiring as always, sir.

236
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,640
莉莉
Lily?

237
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,240
她把颜料放哪了?
Where's she put those paints?

238
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey.

239
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:04,700
莉莉  问你点事
Hey. Um, Lily, question for you.

240
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,680
为什么我在你的抽屉里
Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball

241
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,580
找到了德拉泽先生的 有三个彼特・罗斯签名的棒球?
signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?

242
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,500
很简单　我拿的
That's easy. I took it.

243
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,500
为什么
Why?

244
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,220
很简单
It's simple.

245
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,820
为什么牛排上面没有黑胡椒汁?
I can't believe there's no horseradish for the roast beef.

246
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,130
你是不是  不会做三明治?
I guess you were sick the day they taught that at Sandwich University.

247
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,830
妈妈  疗养院的人没偷你的钱
Mother, no one from the nursing home is stealing from you.

248
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,790
我没给你买生日礼物
I didn't get you a birthday present.

249
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,710
什么  你不哭?
What? You gonna cry?

250
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,400
鼻涕虫怎么不哭?
Little  crybaby's going to cry?

251
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:45,920
大家看啊
Hey, everybody, look!

252
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,240
鼻涕虫要哭鼻子啦
The little crybaby's gonna cry!

253
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,880
我掉了冰激凌
I lost my ice cream!

254
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,400
最后一个我有可能夸张了点
Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one,

255
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,200
但重点是　他太低劣了
but the point is, he was mean.

256
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,540
因此我就偷了他的棒球(ball还有睾丸的意思)
And that's why I took away his ball.

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,850
但他的棒球和这没关系啊
What does his ball have to do with anything?

258
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,810
德拉泽要学会厚道
Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that.

259
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,720
我在幼儿园的时候 孩子们一调皮
When I was teaching kindergarten, whenever a kid was mean,

260
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,770
我就拿走他们的玩具
I would take away one of his toys.

261
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,670
刚开始孩子们会不高兴
The kid would be upset at first,

262
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,370
然后他们就不调皮了
but then he'd learn to stop being mean.

263
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,990
伙计们　怎么啦?
Hey, guys. What's going on?

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,010
莉莉偷了我老板的 有三个彼特・罗斯签名的棒球
Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.

265
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,740
为什么　因为他很低劣?
Why? Was he being mean?

266
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,310
- 你怎么知道 - 当然了
- You know about this? - Yeah.

267
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,620
这是她替天行道的方式
It's her own personal form of justice.

268
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,400
你告诉过他我们在Gap专卖店的故事吗
Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?

269
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,620
对　那是个好例子
Oh, that was a good one.

270
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:32,580
那个售货员对罗宾很凶
This sales guy was rude to Robin,

271
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,150
所以我就偷了件卡其裤
so I took a pair of khakis.

272
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,170
我把它当生日礼物送给了你
I gave them to you for your birthday.

273
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,360
然后我稀里糊涂卷进了偷窃案
So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?

274
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,140
我更喜欢叫它公道
I prefer to call them "justice khakis."

275
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,860
这不是公道　这是偷窃 这是犯罪
That's not justice. It's shoplifting, and it's a crime.

276
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,700
这也只不过是不厚道
So is being mean.

277
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,870
莉莉　你的办法行不通
Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense.

278
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,060
在幼儿园里 孩子们知道为何他们要被惩罚
In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished.

279
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:52,260
德拉泽会认为是偷窃
Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.

280
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,090
这就是为什么我留了个字条
Well, that's why I left a note.

281
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,590
- 字条? - 是
- A note? - Yeah.

282
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,480
他看到字条 就会知道为什么棒球不见了
When  he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away,

283
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,030
他就会学着厚道点
he'll stop being mean,

284
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,570
办公室也会清静点
and the office will be a nicer place to work.

285
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,520
也许他还会听取点别人的意见
Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.

286
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,610
听着　莉莉 我们一直在忍受
Look, Lil, we're all tolerating

287
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,410
朋克乐队　养蜂人 还有那些小偷小摸
this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having,

288
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,510
这些无理取闹
with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny,

289
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,960
但这次你不能把我的工作当儿戏
but this is my career you're messing with.

290
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,280
我不喜欢你这么对我说话
I'm not sure I like your tone.

291
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:19,860
你知道吗
You know what?

292
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,020
现在球你就甭想拿回去了
Now you just lost the ball.

293
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,643
Hey.

294
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,790
我想知道你昨晚进展的怎样 今天考了一次试
I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today.

295
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,740
大家的分数都在C-以下
Nobody got higher than a C-minus.

296
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,560
我就知道
I know, I know.

297
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,080
你一直说自己经验丰富
You claim to have so much sex.

298
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,230
我还真的以为　你是个行家呢
I only assumed you'd be good at it.

299
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,580
我失算了
Look, I miscalculated.

300
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,350
我以为她以为老了 不中用了  像大多数"美洲豹"
I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars.

301
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,540
没想到她还这么勇猛
But kitty's got claws.

302
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,300
但是不用担心
Don't worry though.

303
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,670
今晚　我再去见她
Tonight, I'm seeing her again.

304
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,980
算了吧　哥们 你会让事情更糟
Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.

305
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,540
我保证　今晚之后 这只美洲豹会温顺的想只猫咪
I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet,

306
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,260
而我　就是她的主人
and I its master.

307
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,750
我想我是爱上你了
I think I'm falling in love with you.

308
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,500
这不会是你的第一次吧
Oh, God. That wasn't your first time, was it?

309
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,110
这样就说的通了
Although that would explain a lot.

310
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,580
什么　我们昨天还上过床啊
What? No. We had sex yesterday.

311
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,330
可能吧
Oh, right. That.

312
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,710
你昨天跟人上了床
Well, you had sex yesterday.

313
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,620
而我在修正你上床的课程摘要
I revised my syllabus for the spring semester.

314
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,590
德拉泽取拿面包的时候
When Druthers goes to get his bagel,

315
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,020
我就进办公室　拿走纸条 把棒球放回去
I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back.

316
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,650
如果有什么意外的话
If something goes wrong,

317
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,170
你就说　谁要蒸馏咖啡
yell out, "Who wants espresso?"

318
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,230
这样我就知道他要过来
so I'll know he's coming. Got it?

319
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
好　现在把球给我
Okay, now give me the ball.

320
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,770
- 不 - 你这是什么意思?
- No. - What do you mean, no?

321
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,190
我要坚持我的原则
I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.

322
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,420
行行好　莉莉 我们快没时间了
Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.

323
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,360
大家都过来!
Everybody get in here now!

324
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,090
谁要蒸馏咖啡?
Who wants espresso?

325
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,350
大部分人应该都知道
Now, as most of you know,

326
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,090
我那有三个彼特・罗斯 签名的棒球不见了
my Pete Rose, Pete Rose, Pete Rose baseball has been stolen.

327
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,640
我刚才看到一张纸条
Well, I just found this note.

328
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,280
亲爱的德拉泽先生 我...你的棒球　现在走了
"Dear Mr. Druthers, I, your baseball, am leaving.

329
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,600
如果你现在开始学好的话 那我还会回来
Maybe, if you start being nice, I'll come back.

330
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,870
如果不　你办公室里的 其他东西也会象我一样走掉
If not, other things in your office may follow my lead.

331
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,750
事实上　我无意中 听到你的iPod说
In fact, I overheard your iPod talking,

332
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,140
它随时可能走掉
and he may shuffle off at any minute."

333
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,470
我会对着你们吼到我发不出声来
Normally, I would scream at everyone until my voice goes,

334
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,090
但是　在这里可能不妥
but maybe that's the wrong reaction here.

335
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,470
有意思
Interesting.

336
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,210
我给你们个机会 如果到今天晚上
Instead,  I'm giving my baseball until the end of the day

337
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,710
我的棒球还没有回家的话
to decide he's homesick,

338
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,950
那明天早上 我会在一小时内开除三个人
or, tomorrow morning, I'll begin firing three people an hour.

339
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,920
如果那个贼不相信
And, if the thief doesn't believe me, well,

340
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,040
那你这次下的赌注
then you are gambling more than Pete Rose--

341
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,940
就得比彼特・罗斯 联盟历史上伟大的击球手
major league baseball's all-time hit leader,

342
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,520
他没有被选入名人堂 这对整个体育界来说
a man whose absence from the Hall of Fame is a travesty

343
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:52,280
都是个悲剧...还要大
to the entire sports world-- ever "allegedly" did!

344
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,940
看起来他要跟iPod说拜拜了
Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.

345
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,660
马上把棒球放回去
Give him his ball back right now.

346
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,110
别人会因你而开除的
People are going to get fired.

347
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,060
不会的 刚才他只是发了下飙
No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted.

348
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,240
幼儿园里　我经常看到这样
I saw this in kindergarten all the time.

349
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,730
这里不是幼儿园
This isn't kindergarten.

350
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,130
德拉泽是个大人 他要他的棒球
Mr. Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.

351
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,420
如果你把你的计划给他看 我就放回去
All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.

352
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,600
不行　要么你放回去 要么你被开除
No. You'll give it back or you're fired.

353
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,140
对不起　泰德 我不会这么做的
I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.

354
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,360
那你被开除了
Then you're fired.

355
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,800
好的
Fine.

356
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,960
给你球
Here's the ball.

357
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:30,000
现在你至少有一个赌注了(Lily这里讽刺Ted没种把自己的设计给Boss看)
At least you have one now.

358
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,410
哥们　你整死我了
Dude, you're killing me.

359
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,070
你没搞定那只母豹 还把她惹怒了
You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.

360
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,730
你没看到我在吃PowerBar (一种运动营养品)
Do you not see the PowerBar in my hand?

361
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,620
我正在给自己充电
I'm fueling up.

362
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,590
你今晚还要过去?
So you're going back over there?

363
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
当然了
Oh, yeah.

364
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,470
今晚  我就是约翰・梅伦坎普 (摇滚歌手  中名是美洲豹)
And tonight, just like John Mellencamp,

365
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,210
我要彻底的征服那只美洲豹
I am going to get rid of the "Cougar" once and for all.

366
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,960
懂我的意思?
Get it?

367
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,410
约翰把自己的名字改成了美洲豹
'Cause that's what he did with his name.

368
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,010
我没办法不想你
I can't stop thinking about you.

369
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,980
请再给我次机会吧
Please give me another chance.

370
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,410
巴尼　我白天都要教书
Barney, I teach all day.

371
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,090
这是回家最后才干的事情
It's the last thing I want to do when I get home.

372
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,260
但是你不知道 以前我还没有全力以赴
But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you,

373
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,460
让开　不然你会摔破屁股的
holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something.

374
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,710
这一次　我不会再心慈手软了 我不管这次是不是要干上
But, this time, no mercy. I don't care how long it takes--

375
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,810
几天　几个星期　还是半年
days, weeks, half a year.

376
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,970
好吧  进来吧
Fine. Come in.

377
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,040
等我改好这些论文 你才能开始
You can start while I finish grading some papers.

378
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,960
抓紧点　客户随时回来
Hurry up. Clients will be here any moment.

379
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,530
把这个放近点
Now, slide it closer to his chair.

380
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,140
我们的设计会让他大吃一惊
I want this thing to really smack him in the face.

381
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,630
德拉泽先生 谢谢你能理解莉莉
Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.

382
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,940
其实我很同情她
Oh. Well, I pity her.

383
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,830
从我办公室偷走了 棒球还写下这么可笑的字条
I mean, to steal from my office and then write that slanderous note...

384
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,800
你说下　莉莉脑子有毛病
You might say that Lily was mentally deranged.

385
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,410
请你说下泰德
You might say that, Ted.

386
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,010
莉莉脑子有毛病
Lily was mentally deranged.

387
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,280
你最好说的大声点 让每个人都听到
You might even say it loud enough for everyone to hear.

388
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,470
莉莉脑子有毛病!
Lily was mentally deranged!

389
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,830
这话好像有点过分吧 你说呢　泰德
Oh! That's a bit harsh, don't you think, Ted?

390
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,080
客户来了
The clients are here.

391
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,790
太好了　快请进来
Excellent. Bring them in.

392
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,170
我们的客户是斯波坎市 一家大型银行和金融服务公司
Our client was a major bank and financial services company in Spokane.

393
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,520
他们想要一座 能体现东西部风情历史
They wanted a modern skyscraper that still captured

394
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,470
现代化大厦
the distinct flavor and history of the Northwest.

395
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,300
先生们　女士们 现在我给你们展示
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

396
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:41,030
斯波坎市银行大厦
the Spokane National Bank Building.

397
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,020
这是小弟弟啊
That's a penis!

398
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,230
这...这太荒唐了
That's... that's ridiculous.

399
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,250
人们不可能 把这座宏伟的大厦当成...
There's no way this majestic tower can be confused

400
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,990
男性生殖器
with the male organ of love.

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,200
我们不会造这样的一座建筑
We're not building a penis.

402
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,850
你还有别的创意?
You got any other ideas?

403
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,490
别的创意?
Other ideas?

404
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,640
你说要汉默・德拉泽风格的建筑
You said you wanted Hammond Druthers.

405
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,350
这就是汉默・德拉泽风格
This is Hammond Druthers.

406
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,260
那我只能说再见了
Well, hats off to your ladyfriends,

407
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,610
我不会接受这个设计
but I'm not building it.

408
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,790
我们的合作结束了
We're done here.

409
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,030
如果不是那天我不小心 穿了莉莉的公道之裤
The trajectory of my entire career might have been different

410
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,010
我的人生轨迹可能会完全不同
had I not unwittingly worn my justice khakis that day.

411
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,580
等等
Wait!

412
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,820
我们还有个创意
We have one more idea for you.

413
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,700
泰德　你在干什么?
Ted, what are you doing?

414
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,160
我还有一个设计
I have another design.

415
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,470
坐下　马上闭嘴
Sit down, shut up right now.

416
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,840
不
No.

417
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:38,812
# Thank you for the invitation #

418
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:41,522
# She showed me very nice... #

419
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,360
我们敬下泰德 他可能是最年轻的
To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building

420
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,240
70层大楼的设计师
over 70 stories probably!

421
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,700
可能!
Probably!

422
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,990
恭喜你　泰德
Congrats, Ted.

423
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,630
谢谢你告诉我 去反对德拉泽
Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers

424
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,210
并提出自己的看法
and pitch my idea.

425
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,940
真的　没有你 这些都不可能发生
Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.

426
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,260
你知道吗　泰德?
Oh. You know what, Ted?

427
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,760
这太棒了
That was very nice.

428
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,620
你现在可以把这些螺丝拿回去了
You have earned these screws back.

429
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,010
记得拧上螺丝以后 你的椅子才能坐
Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.

430
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,830
莉莉　我现在是项目经理
Hey, I'm project manager now,

431
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,050
所以　如果你想回来工作的话...
so, if you want your old job back...

432
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,580
不　谢谢了
No, thanks.

433
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,390
我知道我现在 我最适合干什么了
I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.

434
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,600
西赛　你可不能这么对小朋友
Casey, that's not how we treat people.

435
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,930
你不调皮　才能把这个拿回去
You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.

436
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,010
- 巴尼! 天那! - 怎么啦?
- Barney! Oh, my God! - What happened?

437
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,480
他摔了屁股
He broke his hip.

438
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,180
没那回事　我只是那里有点扭了
That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated.
