1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:05,069
我和我的兄弟姊妹是历史上
最早的吸血鬼
KLAUS: My siblings and I
are the first vampires in history.

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:06,535
是真祖家族
The Originals.

3
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:09,800
三百年前，我们帮助建立了纽奥良
Three hundred years ago,
we helped build New Orleans.

4
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:12,501
我们不在的时候，一个新的国王崛起了
In our absence, a new king arose.

5
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,807
现在我重回这里，将他的王国占为己有
Now, I've returned and
taken his kingdom as my own.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,143
我曾希望这能让我的家族团结一致
I had hoped this would
bring our family together.

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:19,376
但我错了
I was wrong.

8
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,680
我想夺回我们的家
所以我要去那里生活
I wanted our home back,
so I'm going to live there,

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,815
你们两个
就一起待在这里慢慢腐烂吧
and the two of you,
you can stay here together and rot.

10
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,651
你跟我走，小狼
You're coming with me, little wolf.

11
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:30,227
我干嘛要跟你走？
Why would I go anywhere with you?

12
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,422
你可以反抗我，但你赢不了我
You can fight me on this,
but you will lose.

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,727
任何想阻止你上车的人也赢不了我
As will anyone else who tries
to stop you getting in this car.

14
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:51,744
首先，让我们举杯
敬我们共有的恩赐，永生
Let us begin with a toast
to our shared gift, immortality.

15
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,985
一千年后
After 1,000 years,

16
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,782
你们也许会以为生活会感觉不那么强烈
one might expect for life
to be less keenly felt,

17
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,949
因为随着时间
生活的美丽与哀愁会减弱
for its beauties and
its sorrows to diminish with time.

18
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,856
但身为吸血鬼
But as vampires,

19
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:06,829
我们的感受是人类难以想像地深刻
we feel more deeply than
humans could possibly imagine.

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:17,100
永不满足的需求
剧烈的痛苦
Insatiable need, exquisite pain.

21
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,592
这是我们的胜利
也是我们的失败
Our victories, and our defeats.

22
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,959
没时间安抚你受伤的自尊心了
You can't afford your wounded pride.

23
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:41,657
克劳斯掌控着你的帝国
With Klaus in control of your empire,

24
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,736
你得给他他最渴望得到的东西
忠诚
you need to give him
what he craves most, loyalty.

25
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:46,496
或者至少给他忠诚的错觉
Or at least the illusion of it.

26
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:50,473
我埋伏了他，试图将他活埋
I ambushed him,
tried to bury him alive.

27
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,769
他再也不会信任我了
He's not going to trust me.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,573
他会的，因为他想得到你的效忠
He will because he wants
your allegiance.

29
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,375
以往的经验让我明白
如果你表现出忠诚
Speaking from experience,
I know that if you play the part,

30
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,984
没什么不能原谅的
但如果你给了他任何理由去怀疑你
all is forgiven. But if you
give him any reason to doubt you,

31
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,643
他就会反击
he will strike back.

32
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,689
答应我，马赛尔
Make me a promise, Marcel.

33
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,587
你要不惜一切代价活下去
You do whatever it takes
to stay alive.

34
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,230
敬我的城市，这里又成为我的家园
To my city, my home again.

35
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,567
愿鲜血永不停止流动
May the blood never cease to flow.

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,402
愿派对永不结束
And the party never end.

37
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,711
我不明白，兄弟
MAN: I just don't get it, man.

38
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,872
你知道我们会支持你直到最后
You know we would've stood
with you till the end.

39
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,142
那么做只会害死你们
Letting you do that
would've been letting you die,

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,013
而你们仍是我的人
and you're still my people.

41
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:35,677
现在，听我的指挥就好
For now, just follow my lead.

42
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,622
相信我，这还没完呢
Trust me, it ain't over yet.

43
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,549
敬纽奥良
To New Orleans.

44
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,523
- 敬纽奥良
- 纽奥良
-To New Orleans.
-ALL: New Orleans.

45
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,590
我明白你们有些人也许会对最近
I understand that some
of you may have questions

46
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,291
领导者的变动心存疑惑
regarding the recent change
in leadership,

47
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,369
我今晚邀请你们来是向你们解释清楚
and I invited you here
tonight to assure you

48
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,029
你们不是被打败了
that you are not defeated.

49
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:59,540
不是，我下一步打算
就是庆祝我们所拥有的
No. My intentions moving forward
are to celebrate what we have.

50
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,873
实际上是马赛尔夺走
What Marcel, in fact, took...

51
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:09,417
并建立形成的
...and built into this;

52
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:14,219
一个真正的吸血鬼社区
a true community of vampires.

53
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,889
那她呢，这个狼人？
What about her, the wolf?

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,969
让我说完，迪亚哥
你知道
Had you let me finish, Diego,
you would know that

55
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,198
当然还有另外一件事我要解释
there is, of course, one further
matter I would like to address.

56
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,073
你们许多人都知道
这女孩怀了我的孩子
As many of you know,
the girl is carrying my child.

57
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,044
因此，我相信
你们都会给她应有的尊重
Consequently, I trust you will
all pay her the appropriate respect.

58
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,079
然而，我知道你们有些人很关心
However, I understand that
some of you are concerned

59
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,088
那个恶毒的传闻
by this vicious rumor...

60
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:51,092
说我想要利用孩子的血
制造混合种
...that I intend to use the blood
of our child to create Hybrids.

61
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,958
我向你们保证，我不会这么做
I assure you, I do not.

62
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,999
年度最佳父亲
Father of the year.

63
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:02,038
显然我得赢得你们的信任
It appears I will have
to earn your trust.

64
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,807
很好
Very well.

65
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:06,639
我们会消除你们焦虑的根源
We'll eliminate the root
of your anxiety.

66
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:10,214
你们想想，如果河口
没有任何活着的狼人
You see, how can I sire any Hybrids

67
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:14,251
我还怎么制造出混合种呢？
if there are no more werewolves
alive in the bayou to turn?

68
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,646
什么？克劳斯，不行
What? Klaus, no.

69
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,553
所以，尽情吃喝，尽情欢乐
So eat, drink, and be merry,

70
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,627
而明天
我建议你们去猎猎狼人
and tomorrow I suggest you have
yourselves a little wolf hunt.

71
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,991
去吧，开心一下
Go ahead. Have fun.

72
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,399
杀光他们
Kill them all.

73
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:36,002
片名：创始吸血鬼（第一季）
剧名：统御之痛

74
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,836
绝对不行，我付过钱了
Absolutely not.
I paid for that.

75
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,071
拜托
Please. 

76
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,479
千万不要为任何东西付出代价
主演：约瑟夫摩根
You never paid
for anything in your life.

77
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:43,982
我看不出这有什么关系
主演：约瑟夫摩根
I hardly see how that's relevant.

78
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,615
尼克在惩罚我们
Nik is just punishing us.

79
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,311
我们伤害了他
Well, we've hurt him deeply,

80
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,913
看起来伤得还很深
主演：丹尼尔吉利斯
it would appear.

81
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,388
每当我们以为
已经见识到他最坏的一面
We believed the worst about him
the one time in a million

82
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,618
却一次又一次发现那都不是真的
主演：克莱儿荷特
when the worst
wasn't actually the truth.

83
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,130
你要去哪？
Where do you think you're going?

84
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,390
确保海莉没有因为我们的错误而受罪
To ensure that Hayley
doesn't suffer for our mistakes.

85
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,662
主演：菲比托金

86
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,567
尼克劳斯现在正怀恨在心
If Niklaus is feeling vindictive,

87
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,796
我们不能相信她是安全的
主演：查尔斯麦可戴维斯
we cannot trust that she is safe.

88
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,009
所以我咬了以利亚
把他留在河口
So, then I bit Elijah,
and left him in the bayou

89
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,912
任我混合种的毒液在他血管中流窜
主演：丹妮耶拉皮纳达
with my Hybrid venom in his veins.

90
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:24,086
让他为那些卑鄙的指控付出代价
主演：莉雅派普斯
Serves him right for making such
vile accusations against me.

91
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,588
然后
And then...

92
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,559
你在记录吗？
Are you taking this down?

93
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,356
先说清楚，如果法语区现在是你的
主演：丹妮儿坎贝尔
To be clear,
if the Quarter is yours now,

94
00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:33,123
你为什么还需要我呢？
you still need me why?

95
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,561
我的回忆录
My memoirs.

96
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,828
一千年的历史又不会自己写出来
A thousand years of history
isn't going to write itself.

97
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,500
卡蜜，你在这里做什么？
Cami, what are you doing here?

98
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:43,870
我也想问
My question exactly.

99
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,533
没关系的，她知道
Oh, it's quite all right.
She knows.

100
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,477
- 她知道了？
- 知道你们是吸血鬼吗？
-She does?
-That you're vampires?

101
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,174
别担心，他已经魅惑我
一离开就会忘记这一切
Don't worry. He's compelled me to
forget everything as soon as I leave.

102
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,646
那样的话，我就忙着苦恼
我到底是不是疯了
That way, I'm too busy agonizing over
whether or not I'm losing

103
00:05:55,822 --> 00:06:00,020
而不会意识到我在为一个
长生不死的自大狸做间谋
my damn mind to realize I'm playing
spy for an immortal egomaniac.

104
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,320
你魅惑她和我约会，是不是？
You compelled her to go
out with me, didn't you?

105
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,353
我以为你是真的喜欢我
And I thought you really liked me.

106
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,520
我也这么以为
So did l.

107
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,259
先说清楚
我只是魅惑你让你给他个机会
Well, to be clear, I only
compelled you to give him a chance.

108
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,528
你对他的感觉都是真的
Anything you felt
for him was quite real.

109
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,670
制片：兰斯安德森

110
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,004
再声明一下
And, for the record,

111
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:19,338
我们现在感受到的这种尴尬
the level of awkwardness
we're all currently experiencing

112
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,707
完全是真实的
is entirely genuine.

113
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,473
你自以为很聪明，是吗？
You think you're so clever,
don't you,

114
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,140
魅惑一个可怜天真的酒保
compelling the poor,
naive bartender?

115
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,119
看看我发现了什么
真实的我，不是你魅惑的治疗师
Look what I found,
real me, not your compelled therapist.

116
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,992
实际上
我更喜欢称你为敬业的速记员
Well, actually I prefer
devoted stenographer.

117
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,459
你觉得扰乱我的心智很有趣吗？
You think this is funny,
messing with my mind?

118
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,861
我的理智可不是什么玩笑
My sanity is not a joke.

119
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,263
不，亲爱的，我也认为不是
No, love, I don't believe it is.

120
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,829
你从来没有发现这张照片
You never found this.

121
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,403
你离开这里以后就会忘记
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
You will remember nothing of our life

122
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,034
我们是吸血鬼的所有事情
制片：朗恩麦克劳德
as vampires when you leave here.

123
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,643
明白了吗？
Do you understand?

124
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,939
我想今天就到这里吧
I think that just about
does it for the day.

125
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,577
你可以走了
You may go.

126
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:18,893
想去哪吗？
Going somewhere?

127
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,268
以利亚
Elijah.

128
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,272
你不该来这里
克劳斯派他的手下盯着我
You shouldn't be here.
Klaus has his guys watching me.

129
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,740
我倒不担心他们
-I wouldn't worry about them.
-(GRUNTlNG)

130
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,615
走吧，我们不能逗留太久
我们替你找个安全的地方
Come. We mustn't linger.
Let's get you someplace safe.

131
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:37,185
不，你不用担心我，我很好
编剧：艾胥莉莱尔，巴特尼克森
No. You don't have to
worry about me. I'm fine.

132
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,689
我现在在万能克劳斯的保护下
I've been deemed under protection
by the almighty Klaus.

133
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,022
我现在在万能克劳斯的保护下
导演：乔许巴特勒
I've been deemed under protection
by the almighty Klaus.

134
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,221
那些狼人才需要帮助
导演：乔许巴特勒
It's the werewolves who need help.

135
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,627
为了向马赛尔那群人示好
He ordered a wolf hunt
as some jacked-up peace offering

136
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,289
他发起了对狼人的猎杀行动
to Marcel's crew.

137
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:50,928
- 你们一定要帮帮他们
- 在河口吗？
-You have to help them.
-Out in the bayou?

138
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,004
我们看起来像吸血鬼救援小队吗？
Do we look like a bloody
vampire rescue squad?

139
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,236
我们能来救你你就该感恩了
I think you should be grateful
we came to save you.

140
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,004
听着，蕾贝卡，我这一生
Listen, Rebekah.
All my life,

141
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,044
都在寻找我真正的家人
I've wanted to know
who my real family was,

142
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:05,412
我才刚发现他们在河口
and just as I find out that
they're out there in the bayou,

143
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,212
克劳斯就下令要杀了他们
Klaus orders them killed.

144
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,149
你们想帮我？
You want to help me?

145
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,660
那就帮帮我的族人
求求你们
Help my people, please.

146
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,633
人类召开了会议
Humans have called a meeting.

147
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,134
他们对现状不太满意
They're not exactly thrilled
with the new status quo.

148
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,931
那真是遗憾
How unfortunate for them.

149
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,403
现在是你出马的时候了
MARCEL: Look. It's your show now,

150
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,008
但你如果想知道我如何建立这个帝国
那就是政治
but you want to know
how I built what I built? Politics.

151
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,704
一点点交际手腕就能让你走很远
这招尤其对人类管用
A little diplomacy goes a long way,
especially with the human faction.

152
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,206
明白了
Duly noted.

153
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,578
我已经很久没回想起那晚的事了
I haven't thought about
this night in ages.

154
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,385
1919年，旧歌剧院被烧毁之前
1919, the Opera House
just before it burned.

155
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,994
这是一个时代的终结
This was the end of an era.

156
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,355
为了有个崭新的开始
Now, in the interest
of new beginnings,

157
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,969
我觉得我需要向你坦白些事情
I feel there are some things
I should probably confess to you.

158
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,400
但从哪里说起呢？
But where to begin?

159
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,406
提艾里从来没有背叛过你
Thierry was never disloyal to you.

160
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,567
为了找到我哥哥，我陷害了他
I set him up in an attempt
to locate my brother.

161
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,474
既然他是你朋友
He's your friend,
and consequently,

162
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,582
如果你想的话，他可以回来
he can return to the compound
at your discretion.

163
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:15,315
卡蜜的事你也知道了
还有约书亚那小伙子
Cami's part you just learned,
and then there's young Joshua.

164
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,555
我一开始就魅惑他了
I've been compelling him
from the beginning,

165
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,452
但我想你已经知道了
although I suspect you
already knew that,

166
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,219
毕竟是他让我掉入了你的陷阱
as he was the one who
led me into your trap.

167
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,761
我好像告诉过他一些错误的讯息
I may have fed the kid
some misinformation.

168
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,056
还有黛维娜
And then there's Davina.

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,531
她是个强大的武器
She's a powerful weapon.

170
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,102
眼下，我希望她能随时待命
At this point,
I'd like to keep her close at hand.

171
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,672
我认为我们应该让她
搬来和我们一起住
I think we should have her move
into the compound here with us.

172
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,969
她不能离开阁楼
我曾经试图带她走
She can't leave the attic.
I already tried to move her once.

173
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:43,479
是的，关于那件事，事实上
你的小女巫演技真的不错
Yes. About that, turns out
your little witch is quite the actress.

174
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,981
她和被囚禁的以利亚做了一个交易
She made a deal with Elijah
while he was in captivity,

175
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:47,676
骗你让她留在那里
tricked you into letting her stay put

176
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,253
以换取我母亲魔法书中的一些咒语
in exchange for some spells
from our mother's grimoire.

177
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:53,824
多谢你告诉我
Good to know.

178
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,290
还有吗？
Is that all?

179
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,019
应该就这些了
I do believe it is.

180
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:59,530
感谢你的开诚布公
Appreciate the honesty.

181
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,329
嗯
Ah.

182
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,596
会议安排在一小时后
Meeting is in an hour.

183
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:19,284
（不要相信克劳斯告诉你的任何事）

184
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,587
（手提包的内袋）

185
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:39,896
所以我咬了以利亚
(BEEPS)
KLAUS' VOlCE: So, then I bit Elijah,

186
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,132
把他留在河口
任我混合种的毒液在他血管中流窜
and left him in the bayou with
my Hybrid venom in his veins.

187
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:47,473
让他为那些卑鄙的指控付出代价
Serves him right for making
such vile accusations against me.

188
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,749
你一定会喜欢那地方的
You're going to love it
at the compound.

189
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,010
我已经为你挑选了那里最好的房间
I already got the best room
in the place picked out.

190
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,916
我不能离开
记得上次发生的事情吗？
I can't leave.
Remember what happened last time?

191
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,856
我知道你和以利亚的交易了
I know about your deal with Elijah.

192
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,956
我们不能对彼此撒谎
We can't be lying to each other.

193
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,897
我在试图保护你
那些女巫为了收种祭
I'm trying to protect you.
With the witches still looking

194
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,262
还会试图杀了你
相信我，你和我们在一起最安全
to kill you for the Harvest,
believe me, you're safest with us.

195
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,530
而且那里午后的阳光很棒
Plus, there's excellent light
in the afternoon.

196
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,873
看来你是个艺术家
I see you're an artist.

197
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,009
太好了
Wonderful.

198
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,012
我很期待欣赏你的各种才华
I look forward to
witnessing your many talents.

199
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,710
这是他的主意吗？
Was this his idea?

200
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,444
黛维娜，别这样
Davina, please.

201
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,146
我明白你效忠于马赛尔
I understand
you're devoted to Marcel,

202
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,621
但马赛尔效忠于我
but Marcel is devoted to me.

203
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:37,389
我觉得你也想让大家都好吧
I assume you want
what's best for all of us.

204
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:45,470
我们要下楼开会了
We have a meeting
to attend downstairs.

205
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,848
我会派人来收拾你的东西
Look. I'll get someone
to pick up your things.

206
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,416
我们会把你安顿好的
We'll get you settled in right.

207
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,415
相信我
Trust me.

208
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,521
克劳斯，马赛尔，感谢你们前来
Klaus, Marcel, thank you for coming.

209
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,328
我们获悉了最近在你们群体中
领导权的变动
We are aware of the change
in leadership in your community,

210
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,301
我们想是时候做正式的介绍了
and we thought it was time to make
the appropriate introductions.

211
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,971
我们希望你能明白这里的规矩
We want to be sure you understand
how things work around here.

212
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,805
是吗？
Is that so?

213
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,345
市长的意思是
What the Mayor means

214
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,040
我们只是想确认一下最近的变化
is that we just want some assurance
that this new development

215
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,311
不会威胁到我们的城市和居民
isn't going to endanger
our city or its inhabitants.

216
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:39,447
听着，你们这帮怪物做些什么
我们就当作不知道
Look, you freaks do your thing,
and we'll look the other way.

217
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,792
只要我们的利益不受损失
我们不会有任何异议
As long as our pockets stay full,
we won't have a problem.

218
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,359
更重要的是，有些规矩需要遵守
More importantly, there are rules.

219
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:51,627
不能吸本地人的血
No feeding on the locals.

220
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,795
不要让城市引来不必要的关注
Don't bring any unwanted
attention to the city.

221
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,602
历史证明我们可以和平共处
History has proven that
we can coexist peacefully.

222
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,439
- 但如果你们侵犯了底线…
- 就要对我们有个交代
-However, if you cross the line--
-You answer to us.

223
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:04,983
好吧，不好意思
让我理清一下头绪
(LAUGHlNG) Okay. I'm sorry.
Let me get this straight.

224
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,483
在这个自大狂
和他手下这群可笑的小偷面前
I'm to play supplicant
to this pompous ass

225
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,281
我要表现得卑躬屈膝吗？
and his ridiculous group
of petty thieves?

226
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,824
我的条件是这样的
Here are my terms.

227
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,054
你会得到我认为合适的施舍
You will take whatever scraps
I see fit to leave you,

228
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,097
并且感激不尽
and you will be grateful.

229
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,895
如果你有任何不满
If that doesn't suit you,

230
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,663
或许我会认为你就没有活着的价值了
I may decide
you've outlived your usefulness.

231
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,744
他们显然刚刚还在这
Hey, they were obviously just here.

232
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,149
分头去找，找到他们后，提头来见
Fan out, find them,
and bring me some heads.

233
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,682
我劝你别这么做
I'd rather you didn't.

234
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,316
你们来这干什么？
What the hell are
you doing out here?

235
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,985
我是来建议你另寻他处进行狩猎
I've come to suggest you seek
other hunting grounds.

236
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,425
这建议我听到了
Suggestion noted.

237
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,294
迪亚哥，这么帅气的脸蛋
Now, Diego,
it would be such a shame

238
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,560
被伤了岂不可惜？
to have to rearrange
that pretty face.

239
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,800
你们怎么会在乎狼人的死活？
What the hell you care about wolves?

240
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:04,135
一般来说，我毫不在乎
Generally, I don't.

241
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,642
但唯独这支狼族你们动不得
However, this particular
clan is not to be touched.

242
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,346
再见
Goodbye.

243
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,044
再见
Bye.

244
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,612
反正这里什么也没有
Nothing here, anyway.

245
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,895
好极了，我想我们的任务完成了
Great.
I guess our job here is done.

246
00:14:32,104 --> 00:14:33,366
还没有
Not quite.

247
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,698
我们不是来伤害你的
We're not here to harm you.

248
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:40,070
又见面了
Hello, again.

249
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,110
你叫伊芙，对吧？
Eve, was it?

250
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,181
你就是海莉的小亲友之一吧
One of Hayley's litter-mates, I presume.

251
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,818
是海莉叫你们来保护我们的，对吧？
Hayley sent you here to protect us,
didn't she?

252
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,476
请转告她我们感谢她的关心
Tell her we appreciate the concern,

253
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,020
但我们一直以来都能照顾自己
but we've been looking out
for ourselves for a while now.

254
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,624
除非我们自愿现身
否则没人能找到我们
Nobody finds us
unless we want to be found.

255
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,783
我们这不就找到你了吗？所以…
Well, we found you, so...

256
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,623
正如我所说…
Like I said...

257
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,300
我想有些事情
你和你的家族都需要知道
There's something I thought you
and your family should know about.

258
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,746
我觉得我对他们已经很仁慈了
I think I was far more gracious
than they deserved.

259
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,854
你对我的交际手段感到失望
You're disappointed
by my lack of diplomacy.

260
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,952
我想，最不需要他人提醒
Well, you, above all people,

261
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,927
人类有多残忍的就是你了
should need no reminder of
the human capacity for cruelty.

262
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,429
喂？
Hello?

263
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,540
米卡森先生
只想知会你一声
MAN: Mr. Mikaelson,
just wanted to let you know,

264
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,006
我们已考虑过你的条件
the faction has
considered your terms.

265
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,576
我们达成了一致的决定
We've reached a decision.

266
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:47,905
是吗？
Have you?

267
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:19,408
该死，该死，该死！
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

268
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,080
这都是你的错
This is on you.

269
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,877
现在主事的人是你
这里死的都是你的人
Now that you're in charge,
those are your guys laying dead.

270
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,144
你的人
Your guys.

271
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,150
如果你想掌管这座城市
就不能视手下的生死于无物
If you're going to run this city,
that better mean something to you.

272
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,814
否则没有任何有能之士
会愿意效忠于你，谁也不会
Otherwise no one worth a damn
is going to follow you, no one.

273
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:38,186
我之前还有点担心你呢
I was beginning to worry about you.

274
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,629
我都快受不了你这副
假装恭敬顺从的模样了
I don't think I could've taken any
more of this deferential nonsense.

275
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,896
显然，是我低估了那帮人类
I mean, clearly,
I underestimated the faction.

276
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:50,030
下不为例，但请告诉我
如今事情发展到这种地步
That won't happen again. But tell me,
now that we've arrived at this point,

277
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,007
如今他们胆敢闯进我们的家
now that they have come
into our home,

278
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,942
伤害我们的人
visited this upon our people...

279
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,343
你认为我该如何反击呢？
How would you counsel
me to respond?

280
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,245
把他们杀个片甲不留
Let's go kill them all.

281
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,426
这周围有两万亩的沼泽
We're surrounded
by 20,000 acres of swamp.

282
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,289
在这长大的狼人对地形了如指掌
The ones born here know it
like the backs of our hands.

283
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,330
我们不会有事，但这一带
有从别处来的狼人
We'll be fine, but here,
newcomers from out of state,

284
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,903
他们与海莉和我们并非同族
但关于她孩子的消息传开了
not Hayley's and my kin,
but word spread about that baby of hers.

285
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,268
很多狼人想亲眼见证
这次奇迹般的妊娠
A lot of werewolves want to see this
miracle pregnancy for themselves.

286
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,432
但如今吸血鬼要把狼人赶尽杀绝
Only now the vampires
are out looking for blood,

287
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,977
河口这些初来乍到的狼人
他们也许不知道该藏身于何处
and all these werewolves new to the
bayou, might not know where to hide.

288
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,115
你说得好像我们应该在乎一样
You say that
like we're supposed to care.

289
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,316
相信我，你们不会想让他们死的
Believe me, you're going
to want them kept alive.

290
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,008
为什么？
And why is that?

291
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:35,551
你们自己去看看吧
See for yourself.

292
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,330
我知道你在这，小约
I know you're in here, Josh.

293
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,199
我能感觉到你的恐惧
I can sense your fear.

294
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,478
听说你搬进来住了
I heard you were moving in.

295
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,115
你在这里干嘛？
What are you doing in here?

296
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:09,653
我在躲避追杀啊
试图隐姓埋名
Uh, you know, I'm hiding out.
You know, incognito.

297
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:13,019
本来得没命地逃跑
但直到天黑前我都得被困在这
Got to run for the hills,
but I'm stuck here until it gets dark.

298
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,952
你还好吗？
Are you okay?

299
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,191
很好啊，没事
Yeah, yeah.

300
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,366
不，其实一点都不好
我把克劳斯引进了一个陷阱中
No, not really. I mean,
I totally led Klaus into a trap

301
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,364
这该是史上最大的错误了
that was like the most
epic fail of all time.

302
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,696
所以我现在吓得都快尿裤子了
So, yeah, I'm kind of crapping
my pants right now,

303
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,135
只是个比喻，目前而言
figuratively... so far.

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:32,405
没事的
你可以相信马赛尔
It's okay.
You can trust Marcel.

305
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,706
而且如果克劳斯试图伤害你
我不会放过他
And if Klaus tries to hurt you,
I'll hurt him.

306
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,408
我敢肯定，要是你真能阻止克劳斯
I'm sure if you
could actually stop Klaus,

307
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,177
一定早就动手了
you would've done it already.

308
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,220
你是海莉，克劳斯的妻子
You're Hayley, Klaus' wife.

309
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,119
不是，才不要嫁给他呢
Ew. No. Never.

310
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,351
我是那个怀孕的狼人
I'm the pregnant werewolf,

311
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:53,589
想必你就是那个法力强大的
超级女巫黛维娜
and you must be the all-powerful
super witch Davina.

312
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,468
还有小约
不自量力的菜鸟吸血鬼
And let's not forget Josh,
newbie vampire way out of his element,

313
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,367
公认的下一个最有可能惨死的人
voted most likely to die next.

314
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,836
太棒了
Oh, fantastic.

315
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:06,376
我也是克劳斯的囚犯
Hey, I'm just another
one of Klaus' prisoners.

316
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,241
当然，如果让他发现
你还偷偷摸摸地藏身在此
Of course,
it would suck if he found out

317
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,143
就糟糕了
you were still lurking around.

318
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,385
也许我们可以
共同合作，相互照顾
Maybe there's a world
where we can all look out for each other.

319
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,961
我几小时前就打给你了
I called you hours ago!

320
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,654
我尽快赶来了
I came as fast as I could.

321
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,995
发生什么事了？
你的留言听起来…
What's going on?
Your voicemail sounded...

322
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,161
怎样？偏执多疑，精神错乱吗？
What, paranoid, unhinged?

323
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,362
不安
Upset.

324
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,304
我找到的那张照片
那张…我也不知道
That picture I found,
the one that was, I don't know,

325
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,875
大概有一百年历史的老照片
a hundred years old,

326
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,376
你说这只是巧合，但是…
you said it was
just a coincidence, but...

327
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,548
我的理智可不是什么玩笑
(BEEPS)
CAMl (VOlCE): My sanity is not a joke.

328
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,809
不，亲爱的，我也认为不是
KLAUS (VOlCE):
No, love, I don't believe it is.

329
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,054
那是我的声音，但我不记得说过这话
That's my voice,
but I don't remember it.

330
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,856
我觉得这…这可能是
精神控制之类的把戏
I think it's... I think it's
some kind of mind control.

331
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,619
我觉得他消除了我的记忆
(CELL PHONE RlNGlNG)
I think he's erasing my memory!

332
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,195
喂？
Yes?

333
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,099
他们干了什么？
They what?

334
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,861
这事我们以后再谈
We will talk about this later.

335
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,446
为什么没人跟我商量？
Why wasn't I consulted on this?

336
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,707
你离开了八个多月，基兰
You've been gone
for over eight months, Kieran.

337
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,714
我们已经习惯了依靠自己
We got used to
doing things on our own.

338
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,312
这个克劳斯米卡森
This Klaus Mikaelson,

339
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,977
不管他是谁，谣言怎么传
I don't care who he is
or what the rumors say.

340
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,623
他应该受点教训
He needed to be taught a lesson.

341
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,486
你们会引发战争的
You are going to start a war.

342
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,456
他们有种就试试
I'd like to see them try.

343
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:33,291
对了，基兰
这是你最后一次召集我们
Oh, and Kieran, this is the
last time you call a meeting.

344
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,764
下次你再想批评我们的领导能力
请发电子邮件
Next time you want to criticize our
leadership, send a damn email.

345
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,394
我以为这次会议是你们召集的
I thought you called this meeting.

346
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,164
是我们才怪
The hell we did.

347
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,831
其实是我安排的
KLAUS: Actually, I called it.

348
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:48,804
看来之前与各位见面时
我犯了一个严重的错误
It appears I made a grave error
during our earlier conference.

349
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,543
我朋友马赛尔给了我明智的建议
而我却充耳不闻
My friend Marcel offered me wise counsel,
and I failed to heed it.

350
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,550
你吸取了教训，我很欣慰
Well, I'm glad to hear
you've learned your lesson.

351
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,123
是啊，我不会再犯那种错误了
Oh, I won't be making
that mistake again.

352
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,855
马赛尔？
Marcel?

353
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,063
开始吧
Shall we?

354
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,634
你先请
After you.

355
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,641
看看他
唯一的幸存者
There he is, our lone survivor.

356
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,212
这个城市今天很不幸啊
Such a sad day for our city.

357
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,946
几位头脑聪明的精英
Some of its best and brightest

358
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,422
在密西西比河上过到悲惨事故丧生
killed in a tragic boating
accident on the Mississippi.

359
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,851
听说是很严重的爆炸
Rather nasty explosion, I heard.

360
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:43,061
我要怎么处置你呢？
What am I going to do with you?

361
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,365
好，先等等
Okay. Hold up.

362
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,369
我认识基兰很久了
I've known Kieran for a long time.

363
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,508
他很聪明，也很公正
He's smart, and he's fair.

364
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:53,076
他活着对我们更有好处
He can do us more good
alive than dead.

365
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:54,974
再说他还是卡蜜的叔叔
Not to mention he's Cami's uncle.

366
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:00,016
你平时什么都不在乎
Don't see you care about much.

367
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,278
所以一旦在乎了，很容易看得出来
It's kind of hard not
to notice when you do.

368
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,790
很好
Very well.

369
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:09,757
利用这次机会
重建你们这群人类小团体吧
Use this reprieve
to remake your human faction.

370
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:14,024
我要怎么重新找一个市长啊？
And how do you expect
me to remake the mayor?

371
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,690
应该有副市长吧
Well, surely
there's a deputy mayor.

372
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,395
换一批领导人
我们再进行谈判
Choose new leaders,
then we reopen negotiations.

373
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,444
这群狼人旅行还是很讲究的，不是吗？
Wow, these wolves really
travel in style, don't they?

374
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:33,973
空的
Empty.

375
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:36,279
大概是没付租金吧
Behind on their payments, perhaps.

376
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,513
要继续找吗？
Shall we proceed then?

377
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,350
不要了，然后跟海莉说都找过了
Let's not and tell
Hayley that we did.

378
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,685
那样你让她对你有了好感
我也可以回家了
Then you get to impress the girl,
and I can go home.

379
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,794
你知道我不喜欢小屋的
You know how hovels depress me.

380
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,796
我不是要让她对我有好感
I'm not trying to impress the girl.

381
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,559
我真希望你是呢
不然我们来这里干什么啊？
I should bloody hope you are.
Why else are we out here?

382
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,527
得了吧，以利亚
Come on, Elijah.

383
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,935
你喜欢上她了，承认吧
You've fallen for her.
Admit it.

384
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,372
承认了之后也许
你长久以来的骄傲和闷骚
May do wonders for the stick
that's lodged up your

385
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,511
就可以解脱了
enduringly stoic ass if you did.

386
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,775
我只能说，这事很复杂
这样可以吗
If I admit to you that
it's complicated, would that suffice?

387
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,852
还是说你一定要逼我说得一清二楚？
Or are you determined to torment me
throughout this endeavor?

388
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:27,200
亲爱的，我们不能总是这样见面
Darling, we have to stop
meeting like this.

389
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,164
流言就是这么来的
This is how rumors begin.

390
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,077
你可以走了
You can go now.

391
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,439
该死
Damn it!

392
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,982
也许我说得不够清楚
Perhaps I'm not
making myself clear here.

393
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:41,483
我在威胁你
This is a threat.

394
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,813
给你三分钟，不然你的这群猎人
In precisely three minutes time,
your little hunting party

395
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,084
会变成猎物
will become the prey.

396
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,093
基于你连我弟弟尼克劳斯都打不过
Now, based on your recent failure
to subdue my baby brother Niklaus,

397
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,495
你再不顺从，会输得很惨
this despite a better
than 100 to one advantage...

398
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,767
奉劝你把我的警告听进去
...I recommend you heed my warning.

399
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:10,645
不错嘛
Impressive.

400
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:13,808
我还以为刚才的情势
要动点武力才能摆平
Well, I thought the situation
demanded something a little dramatic.

401
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,057
你们是谁？
Who are you people?

402
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,967
我有更好的问题
你是谁？
I would say the better question,
is who are you?

403
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:38,569
（警戒线 严禁穿越）

404
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,078
合作愉快
To a united front.

405
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:52,655
你的这种行为
这种友好的假象…
This act of yours,
the imitation of friendship...

406
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,019
别误会，你演技很不错
Don't get me wrong.
You play the part well enough.

407
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,058
我很清楚，因为我也装过
I should know,
having played it myself.

408
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,528
不过当时有段时间
我们之间的亲密关系是真实的
But there was a time when
the affinity between us was quite real.

409
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,999
可不是嘛，然后你就决定
要抢走我所建立的一切
Oh sure, and then you got it
in your head to take what I created.

410
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,503
我检起那枚硬币时，我发誓要效忠你
而不是当你的朋友
When I picked up that coin,
I swore loyalty, Klaus, not friendship.

411
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,538
我会信守诺言
但其余的要靠你自己去争取
I'm holding up my end.
The other one has to be earned.

412
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,240
好吧
Fair enough.

413
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,208
那么我最好把事情真相告诉你
Then you should probably
know the whole story.

414
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,286
这不是我一个人的决定
My decision was not entirely my own.

415
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,890
如果我不夺你的权
If I didn't agree
to usurp your power,

416
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,720
女巫们会杀掉我未出生的孩子
the witches swore to kill
my unborn child.

417
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,361
一开始这孩子对来我说并不重要
At first, the promise of
an offspring meant little to me...

418
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,463
但后来我想起了我父亲
But then I recalled my father,

419
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,733
从我出生那一刻起
他就看不起我
how he held me in contempt
from the moment I was born...

420
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:48,173
你父亲对你也一样
...as yours did with you.

421
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,912
我不会让发生在我们身上的事
在我的孩子身上
I will not do to my child
what was done to me...

422
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:57,018
重演
...to us.

423
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:04,418
所有这些间谍活动，操控别人的行为
All this, the spying,
the manipulation,

424
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,689
都是你被迫去做的吗
that's just something
you were forced into.

425
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:07,957
是吗？
Is that it?

426
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,363
怎么，你现在感到愧疚了？
And what now,
you feel kind of bad?

427
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,197
“兄弟，我不是针对你”
"Hey, buddy, it's nothing personal."

428
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:15,066
是吗？
Is that it?

429
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,867
我承认…
I admit...

430
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,978
我嫉妒了
...I was jealous.

431
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:27,679
我看到你在没有我的情况下
创造了一个王国
I saw the empire you created
on your own without me.

432
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,787
我看到之后，我想要
I saw it, and I wanted it.

433
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,357
你错了，我不是一个人创造的
You're wrong, you know.
I didn't do it on my own.

434
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:43,793
我当人类的时候
一直活在我父亲的阴影里
I stood in the shadow of my father
my entire human life,

435
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,961
如果不是你，我永远也走不出来
and I never would've gotten out
from under it if not for you.

436
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:50,203
是你教会了我，人生的路
You're the one who taught me
that a man can't be defined

437
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:52,309
只有自己说了算
by anyone but himself.

438
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,442
那现在怎么办？
So, what now?

439
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,717
你建立的这个社区
This community that you've built,

440
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,447
你赢得了他们的尊重
you have their respect,

441
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,613
他们的爱戴
their love.

442
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,992
我可以统治他们，但没有你
我得不到人心
I can rule them, but I cannot win them,
not without you.

443
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,928
和我一起统治吧
我们肩并肩
So rule with me side by side,

444
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,603
我们平起平坐
as equals.

445
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,438
作为朋友
Friends.

446
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,407
作为兄弟
Brothers.

447
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:54,497
你下令诛杀的那些狼人
他们是我的家人
Those werewolves you ordered killed,
that's my family.

448
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,730
刚认的家人吧，亲爱的
Not for long, love.

449
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,538
这些你所谓的家人
I mean,
this so-called family of yours,

450
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,374
他们也没为你做过什么，不是吗？
they haven't done you much good,
have they?

451
00:28:03,548 --> 00:28:04,845
你自己说过
You said it yourself.

452
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,745
他们抛弃了你，让你独自漂泊
They abandoned you,
left you on your own.

453
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:08,886
现在轮到你抛弃他们了
Now it's simply your turn
to do the same.

454
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,681
也许他们有苦衷
Maybe they had their reasons.

455
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:14,525
对，我也有苦衷，小狼
Yes, I have reason, too,
little wolf.

456
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,853
如果狼人都死光了
If the werewolves are dead,

457
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,689
吸血鬼就不会那么想要你的命了
then the vampires
have less desire to kill you.

458
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,991
我在努力保护你的安全
I am trying to keep you safe...

459
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,432
看起来你似乎不领情
...not that you appreciate the effort.

460
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:29,039
等我把孩子生下来后
你会怎么处置我呢？
And as soon as I have this baby,
what happens to me then?

461
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,246
好吧
Right.

462
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:40,679
我还真是幸运
在你处置我之前，我还有点时间
Well, lucky for me,
I have a little while before I find out.

463
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:46,414
在此期间，我会找到方法报复你的
And in the meantime,
I will find a way to pay you back for this.

464
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:51,654
只要我还算是你们家族的一员
你就不能拿我怎么样
As long as I'm in the family way,
you can't do a damn thing about it.

465
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,767
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

466
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,408
我的小提琴
My violin.

467
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,009
一定是忘在阁楼了
I must've left it in the attic.

468
00:29:06,177 --> 00:29:07,371
那就去拿啊
So just go get it.

469
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,173
不行，我在外面不安全
I can't.
It's not safe for me out there.

470
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:14,148
有意思，我印象中应该是
大家都怕你吧
Funny, I was under the impression
everyone was afraid of you.

471
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:17,387
女巫们要抓我
The witches are after me.

472
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,113
你是指那个疯女巫爱格妮丝吗？
You mean, that crazy witch Agnes?

473
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,691
没错，她也想杀我
不过她已经死了
Yeah, she tried to kill me, too.
The thing is, she's dead.

474
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,628
以利亚杀了她
Elijah killed her.

475
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:28,593
但是…
But...

476
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:32,362
爱格妮丝是最后一个在世的长老
如果她死了，那我就安全了
Agnes was the last living elder.
If she's dead, then I'm safe.

477
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:34,897
马赛尔会告诉我的
Marcel would've told me.

478
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:38,133
也许他不想失去你
这个对抗女巫的秘密武器
Maybe he didn't want to lose his
secret weapon against the witches.

479
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:42,744
你骗人
You're lying.

480
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:44,006
我为什么要骗你？
Why would I lie to you?

481
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,480
因为你想利用我
Because you want something from me.

482
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,913
每个人都想利用我
Everyone does.

483
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,180
我想利用你吗？
Do I want something from you?

484
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,552
没错，黛维娜，我是有事要你帮忙
Yeah, Davina. Actually, I do.

485
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,731
多亏了你的好朋友马赛尔
我大多数家人都被下了咒
Thanks to your friend Marcel,
most of my family is cursed.

486
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,367
他们被困于狼形
只有月圆时才能恢复
They're stuck in their wolf form
except on a full moon.

487
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,095
不过我不笨
我知道每个咒语
I'm smart enough
to know that every curse

488
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:09,104
都有漏洞，而且
has a loophole, and well,

489
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,969
你是我知道最强大的女巫
you're the strongest witch
I've ever heard of.

490
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:15,171
但我不会骗你来达成我的目的
But I wouldn't lie
to you to get what I want.

491
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:16,574
我会请求你
I'd ask you.

492
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,508
我想这就是我和马赛尔的差别
I guess that's the difference
between Marcel and me.

493
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,895
在找东西吗？
Looking for something?

494
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:39,797
我想你搬走后
阁楼一定很安全
I figured with you vacating,
the attic would be a safe zone.

495
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:41,131
在那找到的
Found this there.

496
00:30:41,306 --> 00:30:43,467
很危险，你不该回来，小约
It was dangerous for
you to come back, Josh.

497
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,304
是没错，不过朋友不就该这么做吗？
Yeah. Well, what are friends for,
or whatever?

498
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,110
嘿，海莉想干嘛？
Hey, what did Hayley want?

499
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,150
你相信她吗？
Do you trust her?

500
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,521
我不知道，怎么了？
I don't know. Why?

501
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,689
她告诉我有个女巫被杀了
She told me about
a witch being killed,

502
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,987
是个女巫长老，但我不知道…
an elder, but I don't know--

503
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,620
是啊，那个疯姿子爱格妮丝
我也听说了
Oh, yeah. Crazy Agnes?
I heard about that.

504
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,562
以利亚暴怒，把她所有的人都杀了
Elijah went all berserker
on her crew.

505
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,636
我猜那场面一定超级恶心
满地的脑袋、内脏
I guess it was super gross,
just, like, heads and guts.

506
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:17,369
怎么了？
What?

507
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,142
你不是恨那些女巫吗？
You hate the witches.

508
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,471
海莉说得对
Hayley was right.

509
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,238
马赛尔只是在利用我
Marcel is just using me.

510
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:27,674
小约，我不能待在这里
Josh, I can't stay here.

511
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:30,343
我不要成为他们的傀儡
你得救我出去
I'm not going to be their puppet.
You have to get me out of here.

512
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:35,390
好，但你还能去哪里呢？
Okay, but where else
are you going to go?

513
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,301
我浑身都是沼泽的臭味
HAYLEY: I stink of the bog.

514
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:51,875
活该
谁叫你们之前企图破坏我的统治
Serves you right for your pathetic
attempt to undermine my rule.

515
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:54,867
尼克，听我说…
Nik, listen--

516
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,514
我下令要把狼人赶尽杀绝
When I order werewolves
to be hunted to extinction,

517
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,812
我希望你们站一边去，看着血流成河
I expect you to stand aside
and let the blood flow.

518
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:04,011
你还真是民主啊
How delightfully democratic of you.

519
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:09,119
认出是什么了吗？也许你认不出了
Do you recognize it?
Perhaps you don't.

520
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,525
你上次见到它已经是一千年前了
当时是戴在母亲手上的
It's been 1,000 years since you last
saw it grace the hand of our mother.

521
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:17,098
这枚戒指是在一个狼人那里找到的
你下令要杀的
The ring was in possession of one
of the very wolves whose extinction

522
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,735
正是这些狼人
you just ordered.

523
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,866
所以我随口问了他几句
So, naturally, I questioned him.

524
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,167
他提到了一个传说
传说在很久以前
He spoke of a legend.
A legend wherein long ago,

525
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,367
他们的首领跟一个强大的女巫
a chief of theirs
had fathered a child

526
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:27,909
有了孩子
to a very powerful witch.

527
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,276
传说这个孩子，这个男孩
Their mythology further states,
this child, a son,

528
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:34,748
后来变成了一种
他们宗族从未见过的生物
was later transformed into something
this clan had never before seen.

529
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,085
半狼人半吸血鬼
Something werewolf and vampire.

530
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,583
尼克，我们想补偿你
Nik, we're trying to make amends.

531
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:43,488
我们找到了你其余的家人
We found remnants of your family.

532
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,094
你亲生父亲的血脉
我们救了他们
The bloodline of your true father,
and we saved them

533
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,201
从你指派去杀他们的吸血鬼手上
from being slaughtered at the hands
of the vampires you command.

534
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,670
尼克劳斯，长久以来
比起家人，你更看重你的野心
Niklaus, your ambitions have come
before this family for far too long.

535
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,139
我恳求你，回家吧
I beseech you, please come home.

536
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,644
什么家？
这间可悲的替代房吗？
What home, this pathetic substitute?

537
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,180
瞧，尽管你们怀疑我
千方百计阻挠我
You see, despite all your doubts,
all you attempts to thwart me,

538
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:14,882
我还是夺回了我们真正的家
I've reclaimed our true home.

539
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,619
我夺回了整座城市
I took back the entire city.

540
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,956
当你孩子的母亲仍是你的囚徒
You have the audacity
to boast of your victory,

541
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,326
你还要厚颜无耻地吹嘘你的胜利吗？
when the mother of your child
remains your prisoner?

542
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,298
这一切终究还是为了那只美丽的小狼
不是吗，哥哥？
It all comes down to the pretty,
little wolf, doesn't it, brother?

543
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,131
别说了，你们两个
Stop it, both of you.

544
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,873
就算这东西真如你所说
Even if this is what you say it is,

545
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:35,138
永远陪伴我的家人已经够多了
I have had enough of family
to last me a lifetime.

546
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,778
我何必再自添烦恼呢？
Why would I possibly want any more?

547
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,603
很好，你还没睡
Ah, good. You're awake.

548
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,741
我想请你帮个忙
I have a favor to ask.

549
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,902
我正在为死者祈祷
I am saying prayers for the dead.

550
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,405
希望国王能允许我稍后再为您效劳
I request a moratorium
on favors for the king.

551
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,279
你会喜欢这个请求的
Well, you'll like this one.

552
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,148
我需要你的帮助去保护一些人
It involves helping
people who need protection.

553
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,852
恕我问一句，谁要伤害他们呢？
And whom, may I ask,
do they need protection from?

554
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,189
我
Me.

555
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,730
你知道，最近我曾下令
You see,
I recently ordered the slaughter

556
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,063
屠杀河口地区的狼人
of a group of vagabonds
out in the bayou.

557
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,670
事实证明，我这个决定可能草率了点
Turns out, I may have been too hasty.

558
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,898
问题是，如果吸血鬼们发现
我在保护他们
Thing is, if the vampires
find out I'm protecting them,

559
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:39,474
这事会引起很大争议
it won't sit well.

560
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:46,244
我想我可以安排一下
I think I can arrange something.

561
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,951
但我有一个条件
On one condition.

562
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,979
为了我侄女的安全
For her own good,

563
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,647
我想是时候让她离开这里了
I believe it is time for
my niece to leave town.

564
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,564
没关系的，她知道
KLAUS (VOlCE): It's quite all right.
She knows.

565
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,172
- 她知道了？
- 知道你们是吸血鬼吗？
- MARCEL (VOlCE): She does?
-CAMl (VOlCE): That you're vampires?

566
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,639
别担心，他已经魅惑我
一离开就会忘记这一切
Don't worry. He's compelled me to
forget everything as soon as I leave.

567
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,574
你真是锲而不舍
KLAUS: You are tenacious.

568
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,304
这是我最欣赏你的一点
It's one of the things
I like about you.

569
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,574
克劳斯，你不能一直…
Klaus, you can't keep--

570
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:21,946
但你在寻找一些你根本不想知道的真相
But you're looking for
truths you don't want to find,

571
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,179
怪物还是只在小说中出现比较好
monsters better left as fiction.

572
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,382
该是你离开这里的时候了，卡蜜
It's time for you to
leave this place, Cami.

573
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,095
这是为了你好
For your own good.

574
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,924
你真是个懦夫
You are such a coward.

575
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:36,764
这不是为了我
This isn't about me.

576
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:39,334
你强迫我待在这里几个星期
为了让别人，任何人
You have kept me here
for weeks just so someone,

577
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,302
能认清真正的你，而现在我做到了
anyone, would see who you
really are, and now that I have,

578
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,168
这却让你感到害怕，是吗？
it scares the hell out of you,
doesn't it?

579
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,971
如果你真了解我，哪怕只有一点
都足以让你崩溃
If you knew even a fraction of
who I am, it would break you in two.

580
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,479
那就给我看看
Then show me.

581
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,155
尼克劳斯
Niklaus!

582
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,957
好痛啊
It hurts.

583
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,597
他是个野兽
-(ROARlNG)
-He's a beast.

584
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,427
以利亚，压住他
Elijah, hold him down.

585
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,728
哥哥，别让他们这样对我
Brother, please,
don't let them do this to me.

586
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,997
快点啊，儿子，快
Do it now, boy. Now!

587
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,670
救我
Help me.

588
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:27,215
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

589
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:33,015
没人应该承受这样的经历
No one should have
to experience things like that.

590
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:43,022
如今你知道的这一切
只会让你招来杀身之祸
Knowing what you do about
this world will only get you killed.

591
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,638
而我不允许这事发生
And I cannot allow that.

592
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:55,843
离开纽奥良
Leave New Orleans.

593
00:36:57,748 --> 00:37:01,650
忘记所有一切
你今天知道的事
Forget everything
you've learned here today.

594
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,255
忘了我
Forget me.

595
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,616
你没有留在这里的理由
You have no reason to stay.

596
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,290
我没有留在这里的理由
I have no reason to stay.

597
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,165
听着，我现在跟你哥哥处得不错
Look. Things are good
with your brother right now.

598
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,206
他希望我能一起与他统治这里
He wants to run things
with me as partners,

599
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,867
但如果我们继续这样瞒着他见面…
but if we keep meeting like this
behind his back...

600
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,050
你自己说过的
不惜一切代价活下去
You said it yourself,
whatever it takes to stay alive.

601
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,449
所以这只是为了生存，是吗？
如果你在我哥哥面前说谎也如此差劲
This is about survival, is it?
If you were this pathetic a liar

602
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:40,147
我很惊讶他怎么还没杀了你
with my brother,
I'm surprised he hasn't killed you already.

603
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,347
别这样，蕾贝卡
Come on, Rebekah.

604
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,720
所有爱尼克劳斯的人得到的回报
The only reward anyone ever
gets from loving Niklaus

605
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,418
只有痛苦和死亡
is suffering and death.

606
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,897
你将再一次为他而放弃我
You're choosing him over me,
aren't you?

607
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,230
是吗？
Again.

608
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:56,839
蕾贝卡，很多人需要我的照顾
Rebekah,
I got people to look out for.

609
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,273
而克劳斯给了我机会这么做
And Klaus is offering me
a chance to do that.

610
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,540
如今我有黛维娜帮我对付女巫
With Davina working her
magic against the witches

611
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,343
还有一个真祖作为盟友
and an Original by my side...

612
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:12,347
我没法轻易抛弃这一切
...that's not something
I can just turn my back on,

613
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:14,013
就算是为了你
not even for you.

614
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,586
在你与我哥哥重演历史时
When you were reliving
history with my brother,

615
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,029
你想起过之后的1919年
发生了什么吗？
did you happen to revisit
what came next in 1919,

616
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,430
还是你已经忘记了我们的小秘密？
or have you forgotten
our little secret?

617
00:38:26,203 --> 00:38:28,603
我知道一些话足以让他永远恨你
I know the words that will
make him hate you forever.

618
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,634
在拥抱你的新家人时，别忘了这些
Remember that
when you're embracing your new family.

619
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:54,628
- 他们是不是…
- 他们安全了
-Are they--
-They're safe.

620
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,062
所有人都是
All of them.

621
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:10,546
谢谢你
Thank you.

622
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:14,208
你做的这一切对我来说很重要，以利亚
What you did, Elijah, it means a lot.

623
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,356
- 你该把这个藏好
- 我会的
-You should keep this covered.
-I will.

624
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,921
- 如果让别人看见了…
- 我向你保证
-lf any of the others saw this--
-I promise.

625
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,160
- 我该走了
- 好的
-I should go.
-Right.

626
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,712
不停地数落我有多让你失望
Haven't you had your fill
of telling me all the ways

627
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,288
你都不嫌烦吗，以利亚？
I've disappointed you, Elijah?

628
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,324
有一件很重要的事情我们忘了讨论
Well, there is something important
we neglected to discuss.

629
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:06,931
我曾指责你对这个孩子有不良居心
I accused you of having ulterior motives
regarding the child.

630
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,075
我错了
I was wrong.

631
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,480
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

632
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,918
这些话你一定很难说出口吧
I imagine that must have
been hard for you to say.

633
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:30,892
爱你是一件很不容易的事，弟弟
You don't make it easy
to love you, brother.

634
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,757
但你却仍固执地这么做
And yet you're obstinate
in your desire to do so.

635
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:45,869
如果想好了
只要你们愿意
When you're ready,
should you be so inclined...

636
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,781
这里的大门
随时为你和蕾贝卡敞开
...both you and Rebekah
are welcome to join me here.

637
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,788
毕竟这是我们的家
It is, after all, our family home.

638
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,204
卡蜜，我需要你的帮助
Cami, I need your help.

639
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,108
马赛尔一直在骗我，我不能再相信他了
Marcel has been lying to me,
and I can't trust him anymore.

640
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,345
抱歉，我认识你吗？
I'm sorry.
Do I know you?

641
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,709
你被魅惑了
Oh, you've been compelled.

642
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,483
好吧，你要干什么？
Okay. What are you doing?

643
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,350
没事的，我能解除你的魅惑
It's okay. I can fix you.

644
00:41:35,092 --> 00:41:38,289
我很抱歉
这会很痛苦
I'm really sorry,
but this is going to hurt.

645
00:41:51,141 --> 00:41:55,339
